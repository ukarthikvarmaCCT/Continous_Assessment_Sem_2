 kisi bhi counter se kisi bhi gaadi main arakshit sthaan uplabdh karana, gadiyon ke chart taiyaar karnaa or ekatra kii gai dhanrashi kaa kaa lekha-jokha rakhana iskaa mukhya uddeshy tha
 Initially when the pilot project was implemented in Delhi, the software had several limitations
 ye varjan 1987 main agle varjan-2 ke aane par samaapt ho gaya
 With the addition of new locations and the addition of several new redefinitions in version 3 in 1990, the previous software called Impress fell short of the rising expectations of the passengers and felt the need for a soft ware in which Secunderabad, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai Have the ability to arrange networking of five independent PRS nodes
 18 april 1999 ko chennai piares kii netwarking ke saath sikanderabad, dilli, kolkata, mumbai or chennai sthit paanch piares network antat: ek saath jud gaye

 Railways are required to prepare reservation charts that match the seats of passengers and these charts must be pasted outside each coach
 concert software kii madad se prayek gaadi ke agle teen yatra diwason ke scallyton chart agrim rup se bananaa sambhav ho sakaa he
 The current concert application of Indian Railways shows the gradual progress using the latest technology available
 1980 ke madhya main bhartiya railway ne sabase pehle VMST ke upyog se VAXT system par tikaton kaa computarikaran karnaa aarambh kiya
 This work was done from five regional reservation centers, each of which had a separate function and had its own database
 1990 ke madhya se ant tak ke dauraan kris ne concert kii shuruyaat kii, jisase paanchon yatri kendron ko joda gaya taaki bhartiya railway ke kisi bhi stesan se kisi bhi stesan ke liye ek hi khidki se arakshit tikat jari kiya ja sake
 The entire concert application was hosted from its inception on 5 VAX-VSM clusters located at passenger reservation centers located in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Secunderabad
 desh main piares terminlon kii abhootpurv vruddhi ke saath hi internet inquairi jaise vibhinn interphes vaale software system kaa sampurna lod kai guna bad gaya tha
 The need was felt to move the current application from VAX-VMS servers to Alpha VMS servers
 vidyaman VAX VMS sarvaron se alpha VMS sarwar main migration kaa yah kaary ricard samay-seemaa main puraa kiya gaya
 This new platform led to significant cost savings as well as time savings, which is another important benefit of the latest information technology platform of Indian Railways

 yah irani bhashaa parivaar kii sadsy he or isamen pracheen avastai bhashaa kii jhalak nazar aati he, jo swayan vaidic sanskrit ke bahut kareeb maani jaati he
 The Balochi language also has some similarities with the spoken Kurdish language in northwestern Iran, eastern Turkey, and north Iraq
 balochi pakistan kii nau sarkari bhashaaon main se ek he
 It is estimated that about 8 million people worldwide speak it as mother tongue
 pakistan main ise adhiktar balochistan praant main bolaa jaataa he, lekin kuch sindh or punjab main based hue baloch log bhi ise un praanton main bolte hai
 In Iran, it is mostly spoken in Sistan and Baluchestan provinces
 oman main based hue bahut se baloch log bhi ise bolte hai
 Over time, many other languages have also influenced Balochi, such as hindi-urdu and Arabic
 pakistan main balochi kii do pramukh shakhaayen hai: makaraani or sulemani 
 It also has two sub-divisions in Iran's Baluchestan and Sistan Sub: Spoken Makrani to the south and Spaniards spoken to the north
 baloch bhashaa kaa gadhy sahitya is samay keval kisse kahaniyon hi tak simit he par iskaa padya sahitya adhik vistrut tathaa unnat he
 Baloch was only a folklore in the early period of poetry
 parantu baloch itihaas ke sabase bade vyaktitv vaale mir chaakar khan "rind" ne san 1487 i
 main gaddi par baithne ke ananthar baloch kavita main yuddh-vishyak geeton kaa aarambh kiya or mir gavaahiraam, laashari, naud bandag, bebarg, shah mureed, haani, shahdaad, maahnaaz, umrakhaan nohani, bal or duuda aadi ne lambii yuddheey kavitaayen likhin tathaa sajiv sahitya utpann kar baloch sahitya ko utkarsh par pahunchaaya
 The motivations of the creation of these war poems were the same events in the history of the Baloch caste that took place in that period; Such as the 30-year struggle of the Rind and lashari tribes, the vivid tale of the immortal love of Hani-shah Murid, Beberg and Giranaz and narratives, the antics of Shahdad and Mahnaz, the valor and courage of Shahdad and his followers in the Battle of Panipat because of Humayun's friendship , The war against Beberg Pusser for the singularity of Jusur and Ghayur Balach and other similar incidents gave rise to such high-quality war poetry
 m Dia, which is free from the difficulties of Persian pseudoscience, but is unique in anguish, gaiety and efficacy
 ab tak ye melon tathaa mehphilon main badi ruchi ke saath padhi tathaa suni jaati hai
 In the 18th century AD, such loveliness was propagated in the Baloch language, which is full of beauty and love, and the saga of hair, cheeks and adoration
 is kaal kii kavita saundarya kii svachh anubhuti tathaa premika se dur rahanevaale du:khee hriday kii kahani he jo baloch pravriti ke bhaavon kaa adarsh bhi he
 The most famous poet of the love songs is believed to be Jam Darq, who was the synagogue of Mir Naseer Khan Huri and was given the title of "poet of Poets" by the Baloch ruler
 isane swayan jitne geeton or kavitaaon kii rachana kii un sabamein sundar mukhon, kaale keshon, menhadi lagi laal ungliyon, muktawali se daanton, kataar si bhauhon, rang birang ke aanchalo tathaa sugandhit pallon ke hi ullekh milte hai
 But not all poets of this period are busy searching for a cosmic lover
 yah avashya he ki ve ek chalati phirti tathaa dikhaai denevaali premika kii khoj main nikalate hai par aisa bhi hota he ki ve aisi loukik premika kii khoj karte hue vaastavik premika ko paa lete hai
 Whenever this happens, worldly poetry is seen touching the boundaries of Sufi poetry
 is kaal ke prasiddh kaviyon main tavakkuli, mullah faazil simak, mullah karimdad, izzat panjagori mullah baharaam, mullah kasim tathaa malik dinar ke naag agraganya hai
 At the end of the 19th century and early 20th century, the British did not just take a new regime with them in Balochistan, but they laid the foundation of a new civilization in the land of mountains, deserts and valleys
 inaki vidyaon tathaa kalaon ke pradarshan se baloch sahitya kaa swaroop bhi prabhavit hua
 The Baloch poets adopted new forms of imagination
 jaisore ne aisi kavitaayen likhin jinamein nae shabd tathaa nai yojana thi
 Azad Jamaldini understood the demise of caste and country under the power of the British
 mohammad husain unka ne motaron tathaa kaaron ke pahiyon ke neeche daridron kii ichchhaaon kaa khun hote dekha
 Jawan Sal presented complimentary and practical poems to stop the publication of irreligious ideas
 raham ali bajlaaj bhi angrejon ke balochistan main aagaman se bhavishya main hone vaale prabhaav se aparichit na rah sake or unki style tathaa bhashaa main vishesh parivartan ho gaya
 Now such poems were started in which the Baloch were reminded of their past glory, songs were sung in praise of the Goddess of Independence and the masses were prepared for the freedom struggle
 nirantar yuddh ke ananthar san 1947 i
 main jab swatantraaa mili pakistan kii duusari prantiy bhashaaon ke samaan baloch bhashaa kii bhi unnati hui
 With the establishment of Radio Pakistan Quetta, the enthusiasm of Balochi poets and prose writers increased and a whole circle of new writers came into the fray
 is samay mohammad husain unka, azaad jamaldini or gul khan naseer yadhyapi puraane lekhak hai, tathaapi ve vichaaron tathaa abhivyanjana kii drushti se nae lekhakon main aa milte hai
 Among the new writers are Murad Sahir, Isaac Shamim, Abdurrahim Sabir, Ahmed Zaheer, Zahoor Shah Hashimi, Anwar Qahtani, Malik Saeed, Ahmed Jigar, Shaukat Hasrat, Akbar Baloch, Naguman, Dostmuhammad Bekas, Aziz, Raunak Baloch and Atashad who are new realists They are fearless in adopting style and making new learning experiences
 ibrahimpur bamrauli, elahabaad elahabaad jile ke elahabaad prakhand kaa ek gaanv he
 Bishnupur is a village in tatiha-bambor, Munger, Bihar
 ahal al-bait : "ahl" kaa arth 'log' or "bait" kaa arth 'ghar', yani ghar ke log, matlab islam main mohammad sahab ke parivaar or ghar waalon ko "ahal-e-bait" yaa :ahal al-bait" kehete hai
 The Shia class considers them very learned

 {{{1}}} odisi, homerkrut do prakhyat unani mahakavyon main se ek he
 In the Iliad, Homer describes the Trojan War and its aftermath, while the throne of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, also known as Ulysses, after the fall of Troy in Odyssey, describes the many difficulties he faced
 While doing so, he reaches his home after 10 years
 odesi i
pus
 aathvin shatabdi main likhi gayi he
 In relation to where it was written, it is believed that it was written in the present day Greece in the coast of Ionia, which is now part of Turkey
 odesi main odes yaa ulice naam ke ek puranic nayak ke troy ke yuddh ke baad mathrubhumi waapas lautate samay ghatane vaale sahaspurn kaaryon kii gaatha kahi gayi he
 Just as Hindus are happy reading the story of Lanka Vijay in Ramayana
 usee prakaar odissi main yunaan vir ulisis kii katha kaa varnan aanandamay he
 The prince of Troy kidnapped Queen Helen of Sparta and took him to the city of Troy
 is apmaan kaa badla lene ke liye yunaan ke sabhi raajaaon or veeron ne milakar try par akraman kiya
 But neither the city gate was broken nor the ramparts could be broken
 ant main unani sena ne ek chaal chali
 a wooden hollow horse was mounted on a wheelbarrow
 use chhod ve apane jahaajon se waapas laut gaye
 The people of Troy thought that the Greeks left their idol of the god and were disappointed
 ve use khinchakar nagar main laae to mukhyadwar ke mehrab ko kuch kaatna padaa
 At night, when Troy was celebrating, Greek soldiers came out of the hollow ash statue and quietly opened the gate of Troy
 greek sena, jo waapas nahin gai thi balki paas main jaakar chhip gai thi, troy main ghus gai
 Troy perished behind a Helen just as Ravana's golden Lanka was destroyed behind Sita
 isi se angreji main ‘da trojan horse’ kaa muhaavara bana
 'odyssey' is the saga of the adventurous return journey of the Greek monarch Odessus
 try se lautate samay unka jahaaj tufaan main fas gaya
 He wandered here and there for a long time
 iske baad apane desh lautaa
 Mangalacharan - o Goddess, give me the power to sing the story of the skilled man Odesius who ravaged the fortress of Troy and wandered all over the world, who saw diverse castes and cities, and to protect the life on the waves of the rising sea
 Endured severe hardship
 yah katha choubees sargo main bataai gayi he, jiname sarg ek main try yuddh ke baad das varshon tak yoddha odesius varun ke krodh ke kaaran ksht bhogata evam bhatakta rahaa
 The story begins in the last part of this painful period
 sarg chaar main telmekas kii minilas evam hellen se bhent hoti he
 In Canto Nine, Odesian narrates the story of the Battle of the Syconies
 odesius ne kahajab try yuddh samaapt hua tab grihaagaman ke raste main hamane siconijon par akraman kiya, parajeet hue
 For nine days and nine nights, our battle-ships wandered far away from the north wind
 ant main ham lotson ke desh main pahunche - yah lotus ek madhur vanaspati he jiske khaane se hamaare navik ghor pramaad main nimagn ho gayi
 They were forcibly dragged and brought onto the vessel
 phir aage chalakar ham ek nayanvaale rakshason ke desh main pahunche or apni morrkhtaa se ek rakshas kii gupha main kaid ho gayi
 Then cleverly, after giving him liquor, he broke his eye with a big block and in the morning, when the demon opened the cave to his sheep to go out, we got out by tying ourselves with each sheep
 yah rakshas samudr evam bhucamp ke adhipati varun kaa putr tha
 Due to this, Varun became angry with us
 sarg teraa main atithey raja dwaara odesian kii yatra ke prabandhan kaa varnan he
 In the canto eccles there is the legend of Swayamvar's suggestion by Atheny to Pinilopy
 sarg 24 dusht kumari kii atmaaen ad yamalok main vaa unke sambandhiyon dwaara yuddh kii yojana or yuddh prarambh hone vaa ant main shaanti evam sandhi kii katha he
 Odissi is divided into 24 Anuwakas and its duration is 42 days
 aarambhik anuvaak main devataaon kii sabha main odisius kii sangrakshika ethina jiyas se shikaayat karti he ki odisius 10 varsh purv try se ravaanaa hua tha kintu abhi tak ghar nahin pahunch sakaa he; kaaran, calipso naamak rakshasi ne use ojijia naamak dweep main roak rakhaa he jabaki ethaka main pinalapi ke panigrahanarthi udham hi nahin machaa rahe hai balki odisius kii sampatti bhi chat kar rahe hai
 Zeus allows Athena to act as he pleases, and she appears as a mentor to Odysseus' son Telemacus, advising him to block the entry of Pinelopei's patronesses into his house and to locate his father himself
 Travel dwitiya, tritiy tathaa chaturth anuvaakon main telemacas sambadhi katha chalati he
 Telmacus organizes a gathering and condemns the pioneers of Pinelopy, and begins a journey without telling his mother, with the help of mentor Athena
 menter ke saath vah pilos pahunchakar vruddh nestor se miltaa he jahaan use trajan yuddh ke asal vivaran gyaat hote hai
 From Pilos he goes to Sparta
 vahaan mene laos kii patni hellen se miltaa he or ghar lautne kii taiyaari karne lagata he
 Shortly thereafter, the poet presents the events of the kingdom of Odysseus in Ithaca
 ek ore pinalopi apane putr ke ekaek lupt ho jane se santrast he or duusari ore uske panigrahanarthi bandargah par antinus kii dekharekh main ek jahaaj bhejkar vyavastha karte hai ki telemacas jaise hi laute, uski hatya kar di jaay taaki odisius kii sampatti or pinalopi par unka kabja ho sake
 The fifth verse again contains the scene of the assembly of the gods, in which Athena once again seeks the salvation of Odysseus
 jiyas harmij ko callypso ke paas bhejtaa he or uske kehane se vah vrikshon ke latthon kaa bedaa banaakar odisius ko ethaka kii ore ravaanaa kar detii he
 After traveling with the help of stars for 17 days, as Odysseus approaches the island of Fiacia, the rage of Poseidon, the god of the sea, shatters his fleet and begins to sink into the waves
 tabhi samudr kii apsara liukothea use ek pranarakshak roomaal detii he jiske sahare vah antat: fiaisia pahunchataa he
 In the sixth verse, Nausicaa, the daughter of King Elsinus of Fiacia, receives orders from Athena in the dream to wash her clothes on the beach the next morning, where she meets Naked Odysseus
 saatven anuvaak main vah use kapadaa pahanaakar ghar le aati he
 In the eighth verse, King Elsinus greets Odysseus in the court
 is avasar par bhaat trajan-yuddh-sambandhi geet gaata he to odisius vichlit hokar rone lagata he
 Odysseus has to give his real introduction when the king asks him the reason for crying
 agle teen anuvaakon main odisiastroy ke patan ke baad kii apni 10 varsh kii romaanchak yatra kaa vivaran sabko sunaata he
 In the 12th Anuwak, Odysseum arrives at Ithaca on the magical ship of Phycia where Athena meets him as a shepherd and transforms him into a beggar so that his wife's benefactors do not harm him by recognizing him
 13wein anuvaak main ethina odisius ko uske shookarpal ke yahan bhejkar swayan sparta jaati he or telemacas ko shighrata se ethaka lautne kaa aadesh detii he
 In the 14th verse there is a conversation between Odysseus and Schukarpal
 15wein anuvaak main telemacas apni maan ke panigrahanarthiyon ke shadyantr se bachakar surakshit ghar laut aata he
 In the 16th verse, Telemacus recognizes his father in the house of Schukarpal
 pashchaat pitaputra pinalopi ke panigrahanarthiyon se chhutkaaraa paane kii yojana banaate hai
 In the 17th and 18th paragraphs, beggar Odysseus arrives at his palace where his old dog, Eragus, recognizes him and dies in joy
 isi samay odisius prasaad main upasthit pinalopi ke panigrahanarthiyon kaa auddhatya dekhtaa he jisase aage chalakar unhen maarane ke uske bhayankar krity kii uchit bhoomika bhi ban jaati he
 In the 19th episode, Odysseus and Pinalopi have a face-to-face conversation, but Pinalopi does not recognize her husband, while her old husband Euryclia recognizes her by looking at the childhood amputation on her leg
 20 wein anuvaak main odisius gusse ke kaaran raat bhar jagakar anek baaten sochataa rahata he
 In the 21st verse, Pinlopi challenges his descendants to shout the bow of Odysseus in the innings in such a way that he arrives out of the middle of 12 rings hanging in a huge tree
 sab asafal hote hai kintu bhikshukveshi odisius chhallon ke bich se tir nikaal detaa he
 The 22nd verse marks the climax of the epic
 odisius pinalopi ke saare panigrahanarthiyon ko tiron se bedhakar maar detaa he
 No one escapes, as all the doors of the spacious chamber were already locked, in the 23rd episode Pinelopy recognizes her husband, and the heartwarming and touching scene of the two meet
 maha kavy ke antim athwa 24wein adhyay main, jise kuch aalochak prakshipt maanate hai, devdoot marakari pinalopi ke sabhi panigrahanarthiyon kii atmaaon ko narak ke nichle evam nikrusht pradeshon main le jaataa he jahaan unhen vibhinn prakaar ke traasamay dand die jate hai
 Meanwhile, Odysseus goes to the fields outside the city and meets his father Lartise
 ant main odisius ke ghar laut aane ke upalaksh main shandaar daavat hoti he or ithaka main sukhshanti sthapit hone kii soochna ke saath granth kaa samaapan ho jaataa he
 The story of the Iliad is just 50 days - the events of the last two months of the tenth year
 yadi kathanak katha ke armbh se prarambh hota to us leeda evam hans ke sanyog se prarambh hona chahie tha
 But Homer catches the last part of the story
 bich-bich main vah purv katha kaa sanket karata jaataa he, vah bhi ek kram se nahin
 The legend is already known to the Greek audience
 isi se use koi kathinaayee nahin gyaat hoti, anyathaa ek anjaan vyakti ko katha kaa prathamansh tabhi spasht hoga jab ek baar vah sampoorn kavy kaa pathan kar jaae
 The second thing to keep in mind about Elliot is that his subject, as is evident from Mangalacharan, is the anthem of Echiles
 jahaan yah krodh apni charam parinti ke baad samaapt hota he
 The story ends until a little further, that is, the direct results of this anger until the death of Petraclus and indirect death of Hector, but the death of Echileus, the destruction of Troy, etc
 does not come in this epic
 homer apane mahakavy main ghoshit vishay par badi kadai se ‘tu da point’ sthit rahata he - jaraa bhi idhar-udhar nahin jaataa
 The result of this extreme restraint is the story or 'unity of the subject'
 prayek ghatana samoochee dizin ke andar kasi hui angik sangati ke saath baithaayi gayi he
 There is a lack of unity and consistency in the Indian epics and the whole structure is complete with a loose narrative system
 valmiki ramayana kaa vishay he polastyavadh, par usamen avaantar ghatnaayen bahut deele sutron se judi hai
 In the Mahabharata, this 'unity' is not at all - it is written in the style of encyclopedia
 tulsidas ke ramcharitamanas main avashya yah ‘gathili ekta’ evam ‘angik sangati’ homer kii hi tarah milti he
 As far as the unity and effectiveness of the subject is concerned, no Indian poet, even Kalidas, can equal Tulsidas
 yah baat yahan abhidharth main likhi ja rahi he
 Homer describes and describes the anger of Echiles and its development in 9 cantos and concludes the story by taking its direct, indirect fruits
 yadi vah aage kii ghatana, ekiles kii mrityu evam try-dhwans, tak varnit karne ke pralobhan main padataa to kavy main vah kati-chhati gathili dhaanchaagat ekta nahin aa paati
 The structure would have become loose
 arestu ne homer kii pratibha kii saraahna ‘poytics’ ke un adhyyon main kii he or homer kaa hi anukaran kaa adarsh banane kii shiksha di he, jahaan vah ‘teen ektaaon’ evam prabhavanviti kii charchaa karata he
 In Greek literature, there is a great emphasis on structure
 yah rup vidhaan kii jyamithik sangati, unki murtikla, natyakala aadi sabhi ke andar spasht he
 He did not attach any less importance to Bhaanda than sentiment and ornamentation
 homer main yah pravriti na keval beej rup main vidyaman he, balki uskaa sarvottam rup homer main hi miltaa he
 The whole 'action' in the Iliad is circular
 jahaan se prarambh hota he, vahiin par aakar samaapt hota he
 The rites that provided the structure and the homeland to the Greek tragedy are the ethnic treasures of the Greeks, and they also establish the life of Homer's genius
 isi se homer evam kaalaantar ke tragedy sahitya main dhaanchaagat evam bhavgat samanta he
 The structure of the Greek tragedy is governed by three elements - 'one country', 'one period', and 'one trade or subject'
 elliod main ‘desh’ ek hi he arthath sari ghatana try ke mehalon evam saamne ke samudratat par hi hoti he
 The 'period' is also the same, because the epic story is of a continuous duration of 50 days
 arthath, ‘kaal’ kaa ek anwarat akhand rup diya gaya he - 10wein varsh ke antim 50 dinon ko pakad kar
 He does not spread the circle on the surface for 10 years and he covers it within 50 days
 vyapaar yaa vishay bhi ek hi he - ekiles kaa krodh, uskaa shaman evam upsanhaar ke rup main uskaa fal
 Just here, the epic ends
 odesi kaa vishay vistrut he
 The hero of the epic Odysseus wandered for 10 years after the war
 is dashak ke antim bhaag se is mahakavy kaa bhi prarambh hota he
 The structure is exactly like the Iliad
 elliod ke 50 dinon kii ghatana main vartmaan kaa hi praadhanya he - un 50 dinon main kya ghatit hua, isi kaa varnan kavi kaa uddeshy he
 The events of the past come somewhere along the way
 parantu odesi main yah baat nahin
 The theme of Odyssey is 'odysseus's sad journey'
 atah yah 10 varshon kaa bhraman-vrittant hi uskaa uddeshy he
 Like the Iliad, it begins at the end of the decade, but its purpose is more related to the 'past' than the 'present'
 isliye homer aadhunik filmon kaa flashbek-technic kaa upyog karata he
 The epic begins in the 10th year, when Odysseus Apsara begins a voyage from the island of Kelipso, and his fractal vessel sinks and flows into the land of Nasica
 vahaan ke raja ko apane 9 varshon kii ram kahani sarg 9 se 12 tak main sunaata he
 The 'PRE-MEMORY' technique is in this 9th to 12th cantos
 parantu is purv smriti ke garbh main bhi ‘antahpurv smriti’ he 11wein sarg main, jab vah ekiles ko try yuddh kii katha kaa sheshansh sunaata he
 The time organization of Odyssey is very complicated
 ‘vartmaan’ ke garbh main ‘purv’ evam us purv ke garbh main ‘antahpurv’ nihit he
 The entire period can be termed as 'mukul-patra-bandh'
 kali main pankhudiyon kii ek parat ke andar duusari parat, duusari ke andar teesri parat padi rahati he
 In the same way, there is a time lag for Odessi
 yah kaal-bandh dvigun pechida isliye ho jaataa he ki odesi kaa ‘desh’ ek nahin he
 The theme of Odyssey is 'fierce Seascape and Cavitation'
 atah vyapaar ke kendra do ho jate hai
 One is Ithaca where her queen Pinilopy is waiting for her and her sons and sisters are surrounded by her enemies
 doosraa he odesius swayan evam uski samudr-sataha par kii chalyman sthiti
 The events of these two 'countries' are handled by the great master Zeus
 ‘desh kii ekta’ na hone par bhi vishay yaa vyapaar kaa ekta usee tarah kati-chanti rup main vidyaman he jis tarah ‘elliod’ main
 The poet carefully and carefully protects the consistency and goodness of the entire business by placing the other event in one layer
 elliod kii vishay-vastu simit he
 That is the pattern of the tragedy
 badi saralata se kaary-prabhaav kii ekta saadh lee gayi
 But the subject of 'odyssey' is broad
 yah upanyaas kii tarah he
 Yet so carefully the unity of work and influence has been edited that even today's genre-oriented or form-oriented novels fade in front of him
 ek aadi kavi ke liye-ek prarambhkartta ke liye itani badi kaarigari aashcharya kaa hi vishay he
 In short, the Ilayad's design is tragedy and Odyssey's novel
 itnaa hote hue bhi odesi bahut-si baton main elliod ke samaanaantar he
 Both Iliad and Odesi poetry begin by holding the end of the story
 donon kaa ant bhi prarambh main ghoshit vishay par hota he
 The motion of both are circular
 donon main sargon kii sankhya 24 he
 Hector dies at the end of the Iliad, and the prince-pleading princes in Odyssey
 elliod ke ant main ek shant vaataavaran, kuch kaal ke hi liye sahi, upasthit ho jaataa he jisamen donon paksh mritkon kaa dah-sanskaar karte hai
 In Odessi, at the end, there is a final peace and lasting peace
 donon mahakavyon ke andar aaye charitra ek hi paimaane or saanche main dhale gyaat hote hai
 The deviousness and readiness that Anthony helps the Greek warriors in the Iliad, as well as in Odyssey
 pojidon donon main ek krur evam ujdd devtaa kii tarah he
 Odesius is depicted as courageous, heroic, cruel, and devious in both epics
 minilas usee prakaar dhani, udaar hriday yoddha donon mahakavyon main he
 a friend of wise old Nestor also stays there
 yadi in mahakavyon ke rachayita alag-alag hote to charitron ke chithran main fark avashya aa jaataa
 For example, Homer's 'diomidil' or 'afroditi' are completely different from Virgil's Diomidis or Afroditi
 kathanak evam charitron kaa samaan pattern bataata he ki donon kavy ek hi vyakti kii pratibha se nicksruth hai

 dhanpur gusaai, ramnagar tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke nainital jile kaa ek gaanv he
 2566 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2566 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 2566 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he

 Kshatrani had three sons - Shankh, Vikram and Bhartrihari

 News of the murder spread like a davanal and all his brothers Pran escaped to protect
 vikram ko chhodkar baaki sabhi bhaaiyon kaa pataa use chal gaya or ve sabhi maar daale gaye
 After much effort, Shankh came to know that Vikram is living in a hut next to the lake in the dense forest and is indulging in intense austerity after eating Kandamool
 vah use maarane kii yojana banane laga or ek tantric ko usne apane shadyantra main shaamil kar liya
 According to the plan, the tantric would persuade Vikram to worship Bhagwati and as soon as he bowed Vikram's head in front of Bhagwati, he was struck by a conch sword and would cut his neck
 magar vikram ne khatre ko bhaanp liya or tantric ko sar jhukaane kii vidhi dikhaane ko kaha
 The conch was hidden in the temple

 Vikram snapped and snatched the sword of the conch and separated it from the head

 And he also told that if he gives his golden throne conferred by Lord Shiva to Vikram, then Vikram Chakravarti will become emperor

 Later, Vikramaditya Chakravarti became the emperor and his kirtipataka waved everywhere

 shankar ne to maaya tathaa avidya ko ek hi arth main prayog kiya tha kintu parvarti vichaarco ne donon kaa arth bhinn mana he 1 maaya bhav rup he kyonki is se jagat srrishth hota he avidya abhaav rup he kyonki is se jeev bandhan main padataa he 2 maaya ishwar se jabaki avidya jeev se sambandhit he vikshep tathaa aavaran maaya ke do kaary he maaya brahm ke savaroop par aavaran daal detii he tathaa iske pashchaat jagat ko brahm par vikshepit kar detii he 1 Maya is unconscious, there is zad form 2 Maya is trinitarian ie sattva, rajo, tamo is full of qualities 3 But Shankar's maya differs from Sankhya's nature in the following forms 3
1 Maya is paratantra, nature is independent, Maya is the basis of Brahm while nature is 3
2 Maya is unfounded while Prakriti is false 3
3 The world composed by Maya is false, while the actual result of nature is false 4 Maya is doubtful of Brahman It is related to him, but Brahma himself is not affected by it like a magician 5 maaya anadi he kintu saant he 6 maaya anirvachaneey he vah chatushkoti se pare he 7 maaya kaa aashray tathaa vishay brahm he 8 maaya bhav rup he vah asat nahi he Criticism by Ramanuja Ramanuja's position in relation to Maya - Ramanuja considers Maya to be a real divine power whose nature is mysterious, this power is beyond the comprehension of human beings
 That is why it is called Maya because this power is real and this world is also real
 In Shankar's Mayavad, seven major defects are called, which are called Saptanupati, shelter - Anupatti - what is the shelter of Maya? Dependent on Hm, to be pure knowledge of Brahma and its uniqueness will be fragmented; Maya's shelter cannot be a living being, because the creature itself is the work of Maya, therefore the shelter of Maya is imperfect; in its answer, Vedanti says that although Brahma is the shelter of Maya
 But Brahma itself is not affected by Maya, just as a magician is not affected by his own Maya
 If knowledge is good, then how does Maya cover it if Maya actually does it? vedanti kehete he maaya sat-asat se vilakshan hone ke chalate hi anirvachaneey he, maaya sat nahi he kyonki brahmagyaan se iskaa niraakaran ho jaataa he par yah bandhyaputra kii bhaanti asat bhi nahi kyonki is kii pratiti hoti he 5 pramananu- patti - ramanuj ke anusaar maaya ko siddh nahi kiya ja saktaa he pratyaksh, anumaan, shabd, kisi bhi pramaan se ye siddh nahi hoti he vedanti kehete he kii maaya arthapati pramaan se siddh hoti he 6 nivartakaanupapatti - ramanuj ke anusaar maaya ko koi nivartaydwet vedanti brahm jo nirgun, niraakaar, he ke gyaan ko maaya kaa nivartak maanate he, ramanuj ke anusaar nirgun niraakaar kaa gyaan ho hi nahi saktaa he adwait vedant ke anusaar ye gyaan hi maaya kaa nivartak he is brahm kaa gyaan gyaata-gyey ke bhed par aadhaarit nahi he apitu ye to aparoksh -anubhuti gamy he atmsakshatar se praapt hota he brahm gyaan savroop he kintu gyaan kaa vishay nahi he 7 nivrtyanuppatti - ramanuj ke anusaar yadi maaya bhav rup he to fir iskaa naash nahi ho saktaa he use dur nahi kiya ja saktaa he, vedant ke anusaar maaya bhav rup he yah kehane se wo sat nahi ho jaati he maaya sat se bhinn he bhav rup kehane kaa arth he ki yah asat nahi he Shiv Mangal Singh, MLA in the Second Assembly of Uttar Pradesh, India

 baad main, nepolian bonapart ne francisi samrajya ke vistaar dwaara kuch ansh tak is kranti ko aage badhaayaa
 As a result of the revolution, the king was removed from the throne, a republic was established, bloody conflicts took place, and finally the dictatorship of Napoleon was established, which spread many values of this revolution in and outside Western Europe
 is kranti ne aadhunik itihaas kii disha badal di
 This led to the decline of the absolute monarchy around the world, new republics and liberal democracies

 This revolution also led to freedom in other European countries and other countries also started fighting for freedom from the monarchy

 France had an autocratic monarchy based on the divine principle of kingship

 He made laws against his will

 The governance that Louis 14th centralized required a worthy king, but his successors Louis 15th and Louis 16th were completely inept

 ek baar jab logon kaa juluus roti kii maang kar rahaa tha to usne salaah di ki yadi roti uplabdh nahin he to log kek kyon nahin khate
 In this way the governance system of the country was completely dependent on bureaucracy

 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats

 These oppressive political circumstances gave way to revolution

 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The middle class consisted of moneylender merchants, teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, artists, employees etc
 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society
 france kii aarthik avasthaa sankatagrast thi
 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy
 vastutah france ke raajaaon kii phijulkharchi tathaa lui 14wein ke lagaataar yudhon ke kaaran shahi kosh khaali ho gaya tha
 After his death, Louis 15th participated in the Austrian succession war and the Seven Year War, which further increased the burden on the treasury and eventually Louis 16th made France's economic condition worse by participating in the American War of Independence

 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income

 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy

 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He said that i prefer the rule of one lion in place of hundred mice

 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"
 rajya ke kanoon ko isi saamaanya ichha kii abhivyakti honi chahie lekin kanoon kaa swaroop aisa nahin rah gaya he, balki yah shaasha kii ichha par nirbhar rahane laga he
 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year

 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages
 adhyayan kii suvidha kii drushti se kranti ko nimnlikhit chaar charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he
 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people

 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd

 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places

 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians
 jiske anusaar “saamaanya ichha” hi saarvbhaumik ichha he
 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed
 tritiy charan-1794-99 -“diarectory” kaa shashan vastutah neshnal kanvension ne ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan kar karypalika kaa uttardaayitv 5 sadasyeey “nideshak mandal” ko saunpa
 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
 France was the only country in entire Europe where there was a complete lack of a national spirit
 iske chalate bhi sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Effect of American freedom struggle- 1766 i
 main american swatantraaa sangram prarambh hua
 The American people revolted against England
 france ke sainikon ko bhi is swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila at: unhone yah mahasus kiya ki yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa prapti kii ja sakati he
 He also realized that freedom is possible only through freedom
 france lautne par unhone dekha kii jis swatantraaa ko liye unhonen america main yuddh kiya usee swatantraaa kaa france main purnat: abhaav he
 Hence, he became restless for the revolution here and tried to get freedom through war
 europe ke anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 Superiority of French Civilization france main hi kranti hone kaa ek vishisht kaaran yah tha ki yahan kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe rashtron kii apeksha adhik samrudh or vaibhav purna thi
 Even in terms of governance, the rule of France was highly organized
 france sampoorn europe sabhyataa or saanskriti kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states
 is lekh kii saamagree sammilit hui he britnica vishwakosh ekadashwein sanskaran se, ek prakaashan, jo ki jan saamaanya hetu pradarshit he
 
maget: Mignet jaateey sansad bhawan bangladesh kii sansad kaa naam he

 film kii kuch khaas baton main se ek rahi is film main chitrit kalkey kabeeley dwaara boli jane vaali kilikili naamak ek kritrim bhashaa jiskaa nirmaan madhan karki ne lagbhag 750 shabdon or 40 vyakaran ke niyamon dwaara kiya
 This is the first time in the history of Indian film, when a new language has been created for a film
 bharat ke pracheen samrajyon main se ek mahishmati, kii rani shivagaamee, ek vishaal jalprapaat ke nikat kii maand se ek shishu ko god liye baahar aati he
 She boldly kills the soldiers in her pursuit and sacrifices her own life to protect the baby
 ain samay par, sthaneey gramin pani main dubi rani kii upar uthi baanh main shishu ko dekh lete hai or us bachche ko surakshit bachaa lete hai
 In this way the queen merges by drowning in the falling waterfall from the height of the mountain
 sanga evam uske pati us shishu kaa naam shiva rakhte hai or apane balak samaan hi parvarish karte hai
 As time passes, Shiva grows up to be a powerful young man who aspires to climb mountains and tries unsuccessfully at times
 ek roj use jalprapaat main behate hue kisi yuvati kaa mukhauta miltaa he
 Desiring to find the identity of the young woman, he attempts a mountain climb again and eventually succeeds
 jalprapaat ke shikhar par, shiva us mukhute kii maalik avanatika ko khoj nikaalata he, ek vidrohi yoddha jiskaa dal gorilla paddati ke jariye mahishmati samrajya ke raja bhallaal dev / pallavathevan ke viruddh yuddh lard rahaa he
 The goal of the party is to rescue the former queen Devasena, who has been confined in the palace for the last 25 years in the palace
 or yah mahatvapurn jimmevary avanatika ko saunpa gaya he
 Avanatika loves to hear Shiva saying that he has come only for her while climbing all the difficulties of this waterfall
 shiva ab is abhiyaan ko apane jimme lene vachan detaa he or chhipate-chhupate hue mahishmati main pravesh kar devsena ko kaid se mukt karaata he
 Shiva redeems him and escapes with him, but soon the king's royal slave Kattappa, who is known for his excellent battle skills, follows him
 magar ghaat lagaae bhadraa, bhallaal dev kaa putr, achaanak hi shiva ke sar par waar karata he, magar katappa apane shastr gira detaa he jab use maaloom hota he ki shiva asal main mahendra bahubali he, divangat raja amrendra bahubali kaa putr
 Then here the past events of King Amarendra Baahubali which happened in the past are mentioned
 amrendra kii mata kii mrityu uske janm pashchaat hota he, jabaki pita usase kaaphi purv hi guzar chuke hote hai
 Sivagami, with the support of his bodyguard Katappa, takes over the reins of the empire until the new king is elected
 vah amrendra bahubali tathaa bhallaal dev ko samaan rup se parvarish detii he, unhen kala, vigyaan, chal-vidya, raajnneeti or yuddh kala jaise kai vidyaon evam prashikshan main paarangat kiya jaataa he, magar donon main hi samrajya ke shashan kii abhilaashaa bhinn rahati he
 While Amarendra treats Bahubali moderately towards the people, Bhallal Dev is extremely tough and takes every possible ruthlessness to achieve his goal, even he kills Bahubali
 jab mahishmati ko shatru kalaakeyas dwaara yuddh kii chunauti milti he, shivagaamee vachan detii he ki jo koi bhi kalaakeyas ke raja kaa sir katkar laaegaa use nayaa raja bana diya jayega or is tarah donon natinon ke bich barabari se yuddh sadhano kaa bantwaare kaa aadesh diya jaataa he
 But Bhallal Dev's handicapped father, Bijjala Deva, provides more and more fighting tools to Bhallal by deceit
 yuddh main jab mahishmati ek dfa asafal hokar apana ant samaj leti he, amrendra apane sainikon ko uske saath mrityu se hi ladane ko punah prerit karata he or shatruon ko kuchalakar yuddh samaapt karata he
 But Bhallal Dev already kills the king of Kalakeya, Sivagami chooses Amarendra Bahubali as the new ruler over his decision of superiority and leadership in the battle, making Bhallal Dev the commander for his courage and valor
 
 is purv ghatnaon ke baad, jab raja amrendra ke bare main prashn kiya gaya, to bhavuk katappa raja ke dehanth hone kii baat kahata he, or katappa swayan ko hi unki mrityu kaa jimmedaar bataata he
 i was 7 when i read the Amar Chitra Katha published in India
 inamen kisi mahanayake yaa superhiro ke vishay nahin hota tha, lekin bharat se judi lokkathaon, dantakthaon or aise hi kai kahaniyon kaa isamen chithran kiya jaataa tha
 But most of those stories underlined Indian history
 main mahaj un rajmahalon, yudhon, raajaaon-maharaajaaon kii kahaniyon ko padhata hi nahin tha balki unheen kahaniyon ko apane tareeke se mere doston ko sunaaya karata tha

 Three phase electric power or Trikala electric power is the most popular method of generation, transmission and distribution and use of alternating current in the present time
 yah ek prakaar kii bahufeji pranali he
 There are many benefits of three phage power
 iskaa prachlan or patant sarvapratham nicola tesala dwaara san 1887-1888 main kiya gaya tha
 In a three-phase system, there is no interconnecting of three wires at 120 degrees of time
 ye teenon ek hi aavriti hai
 By Kalantar it means that these currents occur at different points at their maximum value, not at the same time
 arthath yadi pehali dhara kaa adhiktam bindu 0 samay par aata he to duusari kaa t / 3 par or teesri kaa 2T / 3 samay par; jahaan prayavarti dhara kaa aavartkaal he
 There can also be a fourth wire in a three-phase system called a neutral wire
 uparokt sabhi gun 3, 6, 9, 12 phej vaale sabhi pranaaliyon main bhi sambhav hai jinamein teen phej sabase saral he
 Most domestic loads are efficient
 adhikansh deshon main teen feji shakti gharon main nahin jaati balki koi ek phej or neutral hi gharon main aata he
 Three different colored wires are often used for the three phases
 bharat main lala, pilaa or nila rang in teen phejon ke pratik hai
 Neutral is taken from black color and meaning from light green wire
 teen phej vaali kisi raashi ke teenon phejon ko nimnlikhit rup nen nirupit kar sakate hai- If G1 = G2 = G3, the system is called 'balanced', otherwise 'unbalanced'

 For example, if a phase-sequence is changed in a 3-phase induction motor, it will rotate in the opposite direction than before
 dhyatavya he ki kala anukram badalane ke liye keval kinhin do phejon ko aapas main badalanaa hota he 
 Similarly, a power converter connected to a three-phase with a SCR can also do wrong or malfunction if the three-phase power supply sequence to it is changed
 kintu yadi us power conwarter kii electronic budhimaan ho to kala kaa anukram badalane par bhi thik se kaam karata rahegaa or koi samasya nahin aayegi

 Both devas and demons used to do penance, charity, charity etc
 performed excellent deeds, sometimes they received brides from Brahma ji, sometimes from Mahadev, and then the same deeds degrade each other
 The gods became unhappy due to the constant fight, then the gods prayed to Brahma Ji to do something
 Brahma ji told the gods about the churning of the ocean and told him about the nectar from which the Gods would drink, they would not receive death at the hands of the demons, and also said that it is not easy to churn the ocean in it
 Include and get the nectar tactfully, there are reasons to include the demons, one cannot do such a huge work alone and secretly, because the demons know Second, it will take a lot of labor
 On Brahma ji's point, then the gods persuaded the demons to talk about the ocean churn together and asked the demons to get many gems from the ocean, But did not talk about nectar
 The demons agreed, and then they said, "brother, decide in advance that if the first jewel comes out, who will take the second one, so that there will be no debate later
" Gods were a little nervous that at first, the nectar got out and the demons got into hands? But then, after saluting God in his heart, he believed that God will do his welfare and it has been decided that the first gemstone will come out, it will continue to follow the demons and then the same way
 To make the rope work for the churning, the gods prayed to Vasuki, the king of snakes, and he was also asked to share in the gems, Vasuki did not agree, he said what would he do with the gems? Then the gods explained to him separately and asked him to share in the nectar, then he was ready
 Prayed to Mount Sumeru, he was persuaded to become churner
 After all the preparations were completed, the ocean was churned on the appointed day on the parameters set, but as soon as the Mount of Madranchal was lifted into the sea, it sank directly into the depths of the ocean with the help of its weight and displayed its pride, then Banasura among the Asuras It was so powerful, he single-handedly lifted the mountain of Madranchal in one thousand arms and brought it out of the ocean and the pride of Madranchal was destroyed
 Pleased with the process of Dev and the demons and at the request of Brahma Ji, Lord Sri Narayana took a Kachhap avatar and placed the mountain on his back
 Sagar Manthan started: Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Sapta Rishi, etc
 sat down at their respective places to see the process of Sagar Manthan and Dev Devas
 After many days of the beginning of the ocean churning, the first halal poison came out, the poison of which the demon and the beings of the three worlds, When the vegetation etc
 started becoming unconscious, the Gods prayed to God and Shri Vishnu said that only Rudra can save it
 Then Lord Rudra drank the poison but did not allow it to come down the throat
 His throat became blue due to the Halahal poison and since then he was called Devadhidev Mahadev and due to his throat being blue, Neelkanth was known and worshiped
 The churning started again, heat started due to the effect of poison on Lord Shankar's forehead, then at the time of churning, the moon entered the ocean with a fraction of it and appeared as a child with coolness and was present in the service of Mahadev
 Happened
 Lord Shiva was very angry at this devotion and beautified him to provide coolness in the form of Bal Chandra on his forehead
 Then came the Kamdhenu cow in the form of a gem and part of the demons, He thought without thinking about what we would do with the cow and donated that cow to the Saptarishis, now it was the turn of the gods but Mahalaxmi appeared in the gem
 The gods and the demons praised her and Sagar stared at her a part and bestowed Mahalakshmi Ji to Lord Vishnu and she was seated in the left part of Shri Vishnu
 Then Airavat came in the part of elephant gods, after this Kaustubh Mani and other gems came out
 And when a horse named Uchheshrava came in the part of the demons who started praising God with Vedas mantras, then the demons gave it to the deities with pride, keep saying, we do not need you who speaks the Vedas
 Then the alcohol came out, he was part of the demons, and after drinking it and drinking it, he became very happy
 The demons became very happy with alcoholic drinks and when the intoxication subsided a little
 After the churning started, it was the turn of the deities and with the nectar urn, Lord Dhanavantari of Lord Anvatara descended
 But the demons felt that there might be alcohol in it too, so they started trying to take that urn by force
 In order to deal with the growing conflict, Shri Narayan again took part in the form of siren from the sea
 All the gods and demons bowed down to Mohini as Ratnarupi Devi, then Mohini said, why are you fighting? And when the reason was known, he said that according to the rules fixed by you, those urns should be given to such deities, but even then if you want, i will end your dispute by sharing the contents of the urn in all of you, the deity understood
 That God is there and has come to help him, so everyone accepted the sweet words of Mohini
 Mohini asked everyone to sit in the row, then the devas were sitting in a separate row in the row, the nectar of the urn containing the urn, but the demons were considering it as a liqueur
 Mohini said, i will start from the line of gods, because you have already drunk the substance and started distributing it to the gods by saying this
 When one of the demons got intoxicated a little, he again secretly sat in the last place in the line of the gods, and he too got the nectar
 Surya and the moon complained to Lord Vishnu about this, then they hit the wheel to punish the demon for cheating, and the demon was panicked after cutting the head of the demon but that demon remained alive even after drinking the nectar
 
 sabhi daanav bole kya hua? kyun hua? kaise ho gaya? shri hari kaa chakra prahaar daanvon ko yah batalaane ke liye tha ki dhokhe se is daanav ne anadhikaar purvak drvy paan kiya tha jab mohini baant rahi thi to dhairya rakhana chaiye tha, tathaa amrit paan ke baad devtaa ab daanvon se zyada shaktishaalee ho gayi he at: ab daanav irshyaa vash devataaon se akaaran jhagadaa na karen
 jis daanav ne vesh badalakar amrit paan kiya wo galat tha kyunki tay maapdando ke aadhaar par amrit par devataaon kaa adhikaar tha uske baad bhi mohini amrit sab ko baant hi to rahi thi pankti main ek taraf se
 daanvon ko ab pataa chalaa ki kalash main madiraa nahin valki amrit he tab kuch daanav mohini se kalash chhin lene ke prayaas main aage aaye mohini bachaa hua amrit kalash devraj indra ko de kar chali gai or kaha tum log hi aapas main nipataara kar lo
 idhar us daanav ne jisane amrit pi liya tha uskaa sar rahu or dhad ketu naam se jivit rahaa or baad main use chaaya grah ke rup main pratishthit kar diya gaya
 After receiving the nectar, the mantle of the gods remained heavy and they fell heavily on the demons
 Meanwhile, the gods again gained power from Tapabal, when the demons got upset and they asked their Guru, "guruvar, how can we defeat the gods, then their master said that the gods have drunk the nectar, and it is very difficult to defeat them, and The only solution is that if the bright son of a superior Brahmin helps you, then the gods can be defeated
 Knowing the above, the demons thought, why would a Brahmin son do our work, it would be his wrongdoing to support us for this, and no ordinary brahmin of Prithvi Lok will be ready for this task
 If we do something by force, the best and the brightest Brahmin will destroy us and if we go to the weak Brahmin, then the gods will also laugh and our fame will be smeared
 The demons started during the period of churning and contemplation and they all came to a decision that if we donate our girl to a superior Brahmin, the Brahmin must accept it, because the Brahmin is bound to follow the best dignity
 , He will be our nephew and Brahmin too, we will give him Palanga Kshiksha Diksha, will run according to us and when we will fight with the gods
 Then a demon said that it is okay to donate the girl, but how will you donate? This is not the practice of the demons, how else would a Brahmin accept the gift
 We cannot do the rituals of the gods, because they are not compatible with us
 Other demons said that the matter is correct and postponed the meeting for another day to take the decision carefully
 At night a demon was very upset and upset in his house how to solve this problem
 He was sitting in his family
 His wife and daughter asked the reason for concern, Then he told them
 His daughter's name was Keshini, she said, "father, don't worry about the marriage of a demon girl with a superior Brahmin, i know Vishvarava, a superior Brahmin who lives in an ashram with his disciples in the forest near Aryavrit Pradesh
" They make their disciples study very calmly and peacefully, i have seen them, their knowledge is also very good, it seems to me that i have heard them secretly many times
 If father is your command, then i will go to him and ask him to accept me as his wife
 i am sure they will adopt me, i am familiar with their nature
 Hearing the daughter Keshini, her parents were very happy, the father told his daughter that the daughter thought for the protection and well-being of this demon clan, you are lucky and blessed, Tomorrow i will discuss this with everyone and then you will decide your decision
 On the second day, Keshini's father gave the suggestion given by his daughter Keshini to all the other demons, and all were very happy and gave orders to Keshini
 Keshini was successful in her work
 Even after being the daughter of a powerful demon, she humbly tried to allay her parents' worries and Vishrava, son of Maharishi Pulastya, Manasa son of Brahma, accepted her as his wife in the ashram
 As a good wife, Keshini served her husband for many years and one day her husband Rishi Vishrava was pleased and asked Keshini to ask for the groom
 Keshini asked for the boon of being the mother of wonderful and stunning sons, who also have the power to defeat the gods
 As a daughter, wife and mother, Keshini was completely successful in following her dignity
 keshini ne rishi se poocha yah to itane haath or sar leki paidaa hua he rishi ne kaha ki tumne adbhut putr kii maang kii thi isaliye adbhut arthath is jaisaa koi or na ho, thik vaisaa hi putr hua he
 uske pita ne gyarahawein din adbhut balak kaa namakarna sanskaar kiya or naam diya ravan
 ravan apane pita ke ashram main bada hua or baad main uske do bhai kumbhkarna tathaa vibhishana or ek atyant rupavati bahan surpanakha hui
 ravan janm kaa sayong kuch is tarah se bana tha
 It is a thing of the past that there were two gatekeepers named jai-vijay in Vaikuntha Lok
 Once, he had stopped the Shaunakadi Bal Rishis from going to Vaikunth, he felt that the children had good work with God
 Then one of the Shaunakadi sages cursed Jai Vijay that both of you followed the rule of death like a deadlock in Vaikunth lok and while living in the service at the door of Shri Hari itself, there is not even much knowledge, so you get death toll
 You will be The second child sage said that you do not even know that this tradition cannot be done in Shri Vishnu world
 Meanwhile, Lord Vishnu himself came to take those Shaunakadi sages after listening to the voice
 He and jai-vijay apologized to the sages
 On this, the sages said that the curse cannot be returned, when the time comes, you will have to go to the land of death, but as Shri Hari himself has come to take us, he will also come to the land of death to bring you back to Vaikuntha Lok
 The second reason was that once Naradji was proud of his devotion and he used to go to every world and talk about his devotion and penance
 Narada told his father Brahmadev, then he said that it is not good to tell Narada about his devotion
 Narada went to Kailash and told Bholenath there, he also said, Narada, you are saying this everywhere everywhere is not good
 But Narada was proud that there is no Narayan devotee like him in all the realms
 While returning from Kailash, Narada walked towards Vaikunth, then Lord Vishnu built a Maya city to destroy Narada's pride
 On the way from where Narada came, he saw a beautiful city
 Narada thought that i have gone to all the worlds and the city, but it has not gone to this city, so go here and see what city it is
 Narada reached there, it was a very beautiful city, even more beautiful than Indraloka, the king respected Narada, Sited in the palace and saluted Narada ji himself
 After refreshment etc
 said, Maharishi, you are Chiranjeevi, Trikaldarshi Mahatma, my daughter has kept herself after two days, then i have given an open invitation in all the three worlds that whoever my daughter wants will be married to her but if you give me Tell me how my son-in-law will be, then i will be satisfied
 Seeing the palmistry of his daughter, Narada said that your daughter is very lucky, it will get chirinjeevi, ajar amar, beautiful and shatoguni pradhan
 Whose fame is in all the realms, and Narada ji was fascinated to see that girl's form, he also saw all the qualities in himself which were telling his palm
 After this Narada ji left and read out to Vaikuntha Lok to speak about his devotion
 On the way, i thought that i have all the qualities but i am a monk
 Now i should also settle my home like the Saptarishis
 The girl you saw right now is suitable for marriage
 But there is a shortcoming, that is my form but there is nothing to worry about it because i am a devotee of God and now i will ask Lord Vishnu for his form and he will have to give it to his devotee
 Narada reached Vaikunth after some time, God welcomed him and asked, what is the matter in a hurry
 Narada said that God has been meeting you for so many days, i am coming to meet Lord Bholenath and have come to meet you
 Now anyway i have time because since i have attained the high stage of penance and devotion, i have reached the peak of knowledge, rituals and devotion
 i have also conquered Maya and now i am thinking that i should also become a planetary
 Seeing a girl on the way, who is full of all virtues, what should i tell you, God is omniscient and i am also your biggest devotee, so please help me
 God said with a smile, Narada, in your desire to become planetary, you seem to have become diseased on the beautiful form of the girl, so i will definitely remove this disease from you and do not worry
 If you are my biggest devotee, then i too have to cure my devotee's disease like a doctor
 Narada could not understand these sentences of God and said that Lord is the way to remove my disease, give me your own form so that i can look exactly like you in beauty so that the girl can select me
 God said Narada, i am your doctor, so i will cure the disease, don't you worry
 Narada said, God command me, now i go
 Narada ji was happy that now he too has become like Lord Vishnu and reached the day of swayamvara
 There were many people from all three worlds, the king gave everyone a seat to sit on
 Narada ji guessed the last time the king washed the feet by calling me Maharishi, Today, just by bowing in the usual way, gave the posture, it means that God gave me his form, then only this king could not recognize me today
 The girl who started on her own started to select a bridesmaid from one side and Narada ji to draw the attention of the girl standing twice from her place, and as soon as she came out, Narada ji would go to her neck
 Standing leaning forward
 But the girl went ahead and put Jayamala in the neck of another divine man
 The marriage of Kanya was done to them
 After marriage, two Shiva people who came there, looking at Narada, said, why were you being washed away again and again
 Narada was very angry at his words and said, why are you fools laughing and don't know who i am? They don't know who it is, but when they see it, they are absolutely monkeys, monkeys that are found on the dead
 When Narada saw his face in water, he saw a mouth like a monkey
 Shiva Gan again said, why are you looking for the monkey of the dead and laugh again loudly, Narada ji got more angry and cursed him that both of you are Shiva gana live in Kailash and ridicule me, Narada
 You mockingly say that the monkey of the dead land curses you, so you will go to the dead land and that monster will kill you, and then the monkey will beat you
 After this Narada ji moved rapidly towards Vaikuntha Lok with anger, he was very angry with Lord Vishnu

 naarad ne kaha yah kya hua? bhagwaan ne kaha tumne hi kaha tha naarad kii maaya ko jeet chuke ho isaliye tumhaari pariksha le rahaa tha
 Narada apologized to Shri Hari and Lord Vishnu disappeared
 Meanwhile, Lord Shiva also came there and asked Narada to forgive the crime
 Narada said that the curse will not be false, therefore you will be a demon, but i do so much that you will be such a primordial demon that Lord Shri Hari himself will come for your salvation
 iske atirikt teesraa yoga tha pratapbhanu jo chakravarti raja hone ke liye laalach main brahmanon ke shraap kaa shikaar ho jaataa he jisaki katha aage aayegi, jo sitaaji ke janm se bhi judy he
 Ravana appeared from these three curses and as part of all these
 The majestic quality of Pratapbhanu, the tamasic quality of Shiva Ganas and the virtue of devotion to jai-vijay, Ravan took birth as the head of the virtues of these three persons
 In childhood, Ravana got caught on four Vedas with his sharp intelligence, he had such a good knowledge of astrology that, his Ravana Samhita todayit is also considered superior among astrologers
 At a young age, Ravana went out to do penance
 He knew that Brahma ji was his great-grandfather, so he did his austerities first and after many years of penance, Brahma ji asked him to ask for a boon, then Ravana asked to be immortal
 Asked for a boon
 Brahma Ji said, i cannot give a boon to be immortal, you are knowledgeable, so try to understand
 i cannot give you that but instead i give other powers
 Ravana got power from austerities and met the parents who were very happy
 Now a little pride came in the mind and one day, Ravana, taking two or four companions, went to the boundary of the kingdom of Sahastrabahu Arjuna in his youth, there he saw water on the banks of river Narmada even though it was very wide
 ravan ne apane saathiyon se kaha ye nadi kaa jal itnaa kam kaise he pehle to isamen bahut jal bharaa hua karata tha
 Then the fellows went ahead and saw a dam in which all the water of the river was stopped and the dam was made of arrows
 tab ravan ke saathiyon ne usko bataaya ki, kisi ne apni adbhut dhanurvidya ke prayog dwaara baanon se baandhakar jal ko roka he
 wo sab aage bade unhen kuch shastrdhari suraksha main lage sainik dikhe ravan ne poocha koun ho or ye baandh kisne banaaya he
 un logon ne kaha hamaare mahraaj sahastrabahu arjuna ne wo is samay apni patniyon ke saath vihaar karne aaye hai
 ravan ne kaha acha to ab meraa kaushal dekho or ek hi baan se usne baandh tod diya
 sahastrabahu kii patniyaan jo snaan karne ke liye gai thi bah gai kaaphi prayaas karne ke baad unhen nikaala gaya
 ravan ne baandh toda jab is baat kii soochna sahastrabahu ko uske sainikon ne di tab is baat par sahastrabahu or ravan kaa yuddh ho gaya or ravan haar gaya usko bandi bana liya or jail daal diya
 uske saathi bhaag gayi or ravan ke dada ji muni pulasthya ko bataaya gaya tab unhone sahastrabahu arjuna ke paas sandesh bheja ki ravan yuvak he or yuvavastha main galati kii sambhaavna ho jaati he isaliye use chod do
 arjuna ne use chod diya or chetavanee di ki dubaara is tarah kii galati na ho nahin to ek bhi sar dhad par nahin dikhaai degaa
 ravan ko bahut glani mahasus hui or usne varsho tak pun: brahma ji ke liye tap kiya
 or brahmadev ke prukat hone par usne phir se amar hone kaa vardaan maanga
 lekin is baar bhi use amar hone kaa vardaan nahin mila lekin or zyada mayavi shakti praapt hui
 mayavi shaktiyaan paa kar ek baar ghumte hue vaanron ke kshetra main pravesh kiya
 shaam kaa samay tha vaanron kaa raja baali us vakt ek vriksh ke neeche sandhya jap kar rahaa tha
 Ravana laughed at seeing him and then started teasing him, Ai mercut, Ai monkey started ridiculing him and provoked him to fight
 Ravana was proud of his elusive power, he said to the girl, Hey Mercut i have heard that you are very powerful
 Come and fight with me and see how i loosen your pride
 But Bali was in meditation, so he did not listen to it
 After this Ravana kicked him vigorously and said heresy is sitting in meditation with my fear after my defiance, speak directly that i cannot fight
 Bali was boiled with anger, he killed Ravana by beating him so much that he survived only by dying and then tied it in his tail and wrapped it again, ending Sandhya Vandan and he broke the pride of Ravana
 Six For months, Bali kept him in his captivity
 One day he was going to Bali by pressing him in his armpit with his left hand, then his hand got loose and Ravana ran away
 Now Ravan came to know that there are more powerful people than him, i had more pride due to my grandfather
 iske baad wo phir se ghor tapasya karne nikal pada or phir se usne amar hone kaa vardaan maanga
 brahma ji ne kaha putr mere adhikaar me wo vardaan nahin he or is baar usne brahma ji se prachand shaktiyaan or brahmastra praapt kiya
 ek din devataaon se kisi baat par naaraaz ho gaya or usne swarg main akele hi chadhai kar di or ghor yuddh main usne akele hi sabhi devataaon ko parrast kar daalaa
 indra, yama, varuna anya sabhi dikpaal or prajapatiyon ko bandhak bana liya anya sabhi devtaa swarg se bhaag nikle, usne swarg lok par adhikaar kar liya or baad main use devataaon ko lautaa diya, lekin devataaon kaa maan bhang ho gaya wo chupchaap ho gayi
 daanvon ko pataa chalaa ki unka bhaanja ravan akele hi swarg main sabhi devataaon ko parrast kar diya tino lokon main is baat kaa pataa chalaa or is baat se daanav bahut khush ho gayi unki varsho kii manokamana purna ho gayi or daanvon ne ravan kii jai jayakaar kii or ravan ko apana raja banane ki prarthana kii
 ravan ke tej or uske bhavy swaroop or netritv se may daanav ne prasann ho ke apni atyant sundar or maryaada kaa paalan karne vaali putree mandodari kaa vivaah ravan ke saath kiya or ravan patni rup main mandodari ko paa ke prasann hua
 pativrata naariyon main mandodari kaa sthaan devi ahilya ke samakaksh he
 ravan raja ke rup main rakshason dwaara pratishthit ho gaya to phir usne apane liye rajdhani kaa nirmaan karne kii sochi, wo phir se swarg gaya shaayad rajdhani banane ke liye ye thik rahe, sabhi devtaa indra, yama, varun use dekh bhaag liye, wo khus hua lekin use swarg pasand nahin aayaa vaapasi main lautate vakt use samudr main trikut parvat par sundar nagar najar aayaa
 wo sidhe udhar gaya vahaan usne dekha uskaa hi sautela bhai kuber yakshon ke saath rahata he usne kuber ko us nagar ko yakshon sahit khaali karne ko kaha
 kuber apane pitaaji ke paas gaya or kaha pitaaji ravan jabaran lanka khaali karne ko kah rahaa he tab unhone kaha putr ravan is vakt maanane waalon main nahin he at: tum use wo sthaan de do
 tum uttar disha main surakshit sthaan main chale jaao vahaan tumhen koi tang nahi karegaa
 apane pita ke aadeshaanusaar kuber ne himalay kshetra main alkapuri naam se nagar kaa nirmaan maansarovar jhil ke paas kar liya or yakshon sahit lanka se dhan daulat ke saath chalaa gaya
 idhar ravan ne trikutaparvat par lanka ko bahut sundar banwaaya
 uske sasur may naamak daanav ne jo mivi vidyaon main atyant nipun tha, usne lanka ko teenon lokon me sabase sundar nagar bana diya, sone kii panni se or heere jawaharaat, mania se lanka ke sabhi diwaaren, khanmbhe aadi ko mud diya or jab in kii kami mahasus hui to ravan, kuber se chin kar le aayaa
 ravan ne sabhi rakshason ko lanka main rahane kaa nirdesh diya or sabhi ko ek se ek sundar ghar or mahal diye, phir ek din kuber se puspak vimaan bhi chin liya
 rajya sthapana or sundar rajdhani basaa kar sabhi asuron ko acchhee tarah se sab sukh suvidhaayen uplabdh kara kar or unhen purna rup se surakshit kar ravan phir se brahmadev kii tapasya main lag gaya, use dekh baad main uske bhai kumbhkarna or vibhishana bhi uske saath tapasya main aa gayi
 brahma ji phir ravan ke paas aaye ravan ne kaha pitamah mujhe amarta kaa vardaan chaiye
 brahmadev ne kaha wo mere liye dena sambhav hi nahin he lekin ravan nahin mana brahma ji chale gayi
 ravan pun: tap main laga rahaa or varshon baad ghor tapasya se brahma ji phir ravan ke paas aaye usko samajhaayaa ki, ajar–amarta vaala vardaan mat maango tum gyani ho, sansar ke niyam ko pherane kii shakti mujh main nahin, main maryaada main hi kaam kar sakane kii shakti rakhata hoon, putr tum meri tapasya baar–baar kar rahe ho or mujhe vyavdhaan ho rahaa he isaliye jitna ho saktaa he main utna tumhen aaj de detaa hoon
 tumhaari naabhi main, main ek amrit kunda pradaan karata hoon or jab tak yah amrit kunda tumhaari nabhi main rahegaa tab tak tumhaari mrityu nahin hogi
 agar tum is par bhi santusht nahin ho or ajar-amar hona chaahate ho, to behatar he tum mahadev kii sharan main jaao
 mahadev kii main nahin jaanata wo amar hone kaa vardaan denge yaa nahin, kintu mere vash main to nahin he
 ravan ne phir brahma ji se poocha ki pitamah yah amrit kunda naabhi main kab tak rahegaa? tab brahma ji ne kaha agni baan ke atirikt is amrit kunda ko koi nahin sukha saktaa he ravan ne sochaa lagbhag amar hone jaisi baat he, kyunki agni baan kaa prayog bhagwaan vishnu ke atirikt anya koi nahin kar saktaa he isaliye usne brahma ji se kaha pitamah ab aap ajar amar hone kaa vardaan to nahin de rahe hai isaliye main ise sweekaar kar letaa hoon par aapako or bhi kuch dena hoga
 brahma ji ne kaha tum amar hone ke atirikt anya jo maango main dene ko taiyaar hoon tab ravan ne vardaan aise maanga ki usko dev, danuj, naag, yaksha, kinnar, gandharva koi bhi yudd main na maar sake
 brahma ji ne tathastu kah diya
 isi samay brahma ji kii drushti ek apsara par paddy jo paas main jo chhupake se apana kaan laga ke sun rahi thi ki brahmadev ravan ko kya vardaan de rahe hai
 brahma ji samaj gayi koun he kisne bheja he or wo apsara ghabaraate hue brahma ji ko pranaam karti he lekin uskaa is tarah chup kar dekhnaa brahma ji ko acha nahin laga, unhone sirf us apsara ko itnaa hi kaha ‘’jab tumne chup ke sun hi liya he to itnaa or bhi sun lo ki, jis din kisi vanar kaa joardaar mukka tumhaare isi kaan par padega, us din samaj lenaa ravan or rakshason kaa ant aa gaya” brahma ji chale gayi or apsara chupake se bhaagane vaali thi ki ravan ne use pakad liya or bolaa koun ho yahan kyakar rahi ho? usne bataaya ki yun hi brahmadev kya kah rahe he wo dekhne ai thi
 ravan samaj gaya ki devataaon kii chaal he isaliye usne us apsara ko kaha tumhen bahut zyada kaan laga ke sunne kii aadat he isaliye ab mere saath chal ab lanka ke dwaar par, vahaan koi ghuse tab kaan laga ke sunanaa or rakhwali karnaa or use lankini naam se mukhya dwaar par rakhwali ke liye rakh diya
 ravan ab tapasya janit apni shakti kii lagbhag charam seemaa par pahunch gaya tha isaliye abhimaan bhi swaabhaavik tha
 All the demons were safe under his shadow, many of them were not able to do penance in fear of the gods, they started doing penance to gain power and all the other demons started enjoying bliss and opulence in Lanka
 ek din ravan apane abhimaan or aishwarya ke bal par akele hi trilok main vijay ke liye niklaa or sutal lok main gaya
 vahaan sutal lok main raja bali rajmahal main the or ravan bade abhimaan or garajna ke saath unke dwaar par gaya or dwaar paal ko bolaa “ bali ko bolo ravan yuddh ke liye aayaa he” dwarpal ke bhesh main koi or nahin valki swayan narayan the unhone bali ko vardaan diya tha, ki uske dwaar par paharaa wo denge
 ravan ne jab dwaar paal ko jabaran dhamkaakar bolaa, to dwarpal ne kaha “he lankapati ravan, maharaj bali is vakt puja main he or puja kii samaapti ke baad wo tumse avashya ladgen, chintaa mat karo dhairya rakho, wo bhagwaan bhakt hai isaliye pehle wo us kaam ko hi puraa karange uske baad wo apana ye saamne rakhaa kavach pahanane ko yahan aaenge tab tumhaara sandesh unhen ham yaheen tumhaare saamne hi de denge”
 ravan abhimaan main chur tha or bolaa “acha is kavach ko pehnegaa wo main ise abhi tod detaa hoon
” ravan aage bada or us kavach ko uthaane kii koshis karne laga, lekin wo itnaa baari tha ki ravan ko uthaane main pasinaa aa gaya
 dwarpal ne kataaksh kiya lankapati ravan, hamaare maharaj bali kaa kavach tak uthaane main aapke maathe par pasinaa nikal aayaa he mujhe andeh ho rahaa he ki tum maharaj bali se kaise lad paaoge koi baat nahin kuch hi samay kii baat he or aap dhairya rakhen
 ravan man main dar gaya or baad aata hoon kahkar bhaag niklaa, waapas nahin aayaa
 ravan ne sabhi devataaon, yaksha, kinnar, gandharva aadi ko yudd main parrast karke rakshason ko abhaya kar diya or maanvon ko wo pehle se hi sochataa tha ki, wo kya ladgen bechaare sidhe saadhe log he isaliye prithvi ke anya bhu bhaagon par uske rakshas apni chalaa hi rahe the
 yadhyapi shaktishaalee rajyon, jinamein ayodhya, mithila, kaushal jaise anya raja the, wo bahut ucch koti ke pratapi or sakasham rajya the or kabhi seemaa vistaar ke liye yuddh nahin karte the, ye raja sanmargi or narayan bhakt the, unki praja bhi sukhi sampann or ucch koti kii thi
 maharaja dasharath to itane prakramee the ki, devraj indra ne tak unase yuddh main sahaayta maangi thi
 raja janak itane shreshth raja the ki unhen praja ke, hit ke kaaryo or sant seva main apni deh kii sud tak nahin hoti thi or isaliye unka naam videh bhi pads gaya tha
 Increasing from one to one sage, Maharshi, Muni including people like Parashuram, Viswamitra, Bamdev used to come in the court of these kings and for this reason no one could dare to see his kingdom teddy eyes automatically
 ek prashn uthta he ki ravan, sahastrabahu arjuna se, phir baali se maar khaaya, phir sutal lok main bali ke dar se bhaag gaya, ayodhya, mithila, kaushal, vaanron ke pradesh aadi uske adheen nahin the, phir ravan trilok vijeta kaise maan liya gaya? ravan ne brahma ji se nabhi kunda me amrit paaya isse uski mrityu sirf bhagwaan narayan ke atirikt kisi or se nahin ho sakati he is baat kaa usko gyaan tha, man main glani thi ki, agar-amar ho jaataa to kitna acha rahata kyunki uskaa laksh vahi tha or uske liye wo prayatnsheel tha
 But just being immortal does not make any need for force, skill and weapons, for that he got a lot from austerity
 At that time there were many other ascetics like Ravana, Raja Bali, Raja Bali of the Vanar region, Banasura etc
 Ravana thought after getting a boon from Brahma Ji, now he will be happy to take the boon of immortality and will take a boon
 Ravana started the penance of Lord Bhole Nath, did penance for years, Bhole Nath did not appear, Ravana thought that Bholenath is a happy Mahadev and i feel unhappy, thinking that he started doing more severe penance
 , Sometimes being Veena, sometimes playing Veena with the beautiful sources of Lord Bholenath, but the Lord did not turn up
 Ravana thought that his life was useless if he could not please Mahadev, Mahadev who soon becomes pleased with his devotees, and i was filled with self-pity thinking that i could not please him
 One day when he started offering flowers in the puja, the flowers fell short, then to complete the puja, he cut his forehead one by one and started climbing the place of the flower, thinking that in his life, Mahadev If you could not please, then that living person is damned
 Today my head is offered to Mahadev instead of the flower
 Ravana became insensible due to pain but did not leave his mouth saying every Har Mahadev
 Bowing with the last head and bowing to Mahadev, as soon as the sword struck, Mahadev appeared on his neck, held his hand, said, Ravan, i was very happy, you put your life in danger for me, what do you want
 Ravana, bowing at the feet of Mahadev with pain, said very politely, "O Devadhidev Mahadev, i have seen you, you are happy with me, i don't want anything anymore, i was meditating with the desire to ask, But i was blessed to see this beautiful form of you, you are happy, i am completely satisfied with this, Lord and i do not want to be bogged down, you gave me darshan, nothing is a big boon for me, so i have some Don't want Mahadev said, Ravan, i came to give you a boon only because of your resolve, so i cannot go like this
 Therefore, you feel free to ask, you ask for whatever you want
 Ravana said, "O Mahadev, o Devadhidev, o Bhaktavatsal, if you want to give, then give me your unwavering devotion and i will always keep chanting your mantra of" Nam: Shivaya ", apart from that i don't need anything
 Mahadev was very happy to hear that, whose goal was to achieve immortality and he is asking for devotion to God, who can be more knowledgeable than this
 Then Mahadev bestowed upon him his devotion and gave a boon that, your head again
 In addition, whenever an organ is cut, a new organ will sprout again in its place
 Mahadev knew that the guilt of losing Ravana to Bali and others in the battle is in his mind that he is not very powerful, so Mahadev gave him immense strength in addition to devotion and together gave a weapon called Pashupat
 After getting force from Mahadev, when he got up from his place and stepped forward to walk back, the earth shook and Ravana became very happy and again bowed to Mahadev and returned to Lanka
 Ravana of Mahadev became a dear devotee, used to go to Kailash from Pushpanak Vimana daily from Lanka and worship and worship Lord Mahadev there
 Mahadev knew that the guilt of losing Ravana to Bali and others in the battle is in his mind that he is not very powerful, so Mahadev gave him immense strength in addition to devotion and together gave a weapon called Pashupat

 ravan ne teenon lokon ko apni gati se chalaane vaale nau grahon ko jab apane adheen kar liya, or digpaalon se usne apane lanka ke margo me jal chhidkaav ke kaam main laga diya tab use ek tarah se trilok vijeta mana gaya, kyunki trilok kaa sanchaalan karne vaale sabhi devtaa, nau grah uske adheen the or ab use bhi parajeet karne vaala trilok main koi nahin tha usne teenon lokon main rahane vaale adhikansh bhaagon ko apane adheen kar liya tha
 Once Narada ji came to Lanka again, Ravana served him very well, Narada ji said to Ravana, "have you heard that you are stronger than Mahadev, Ravan said yes, you are right
" Narada said how much strength he could get
 Ravan said that it is not known but if i want, i can move the earth
 Narada said, then you should also take a test of that force because a person must know his strength
 Ravana liked Narada's words and said, Maharishi, if i bring Mahadev along with Mount Kailash to the loot of the desert, how will it be? With this, i will know how much strength is there inside me
 Narada ji said that Idea is not bad and left after that
 One day Ravana tried to take Mahadev along with Kailash to Lanka on the strength of devotion and power
 As soon as she raised the mountain of Kailash in her hands, the devi sati started sliding, she said loudly, stop! He asked Mahadev about this, why is this Kailash being shaken by Mahadev, Mahadev said that Ravana is trying to take us to Lanka
 When Ravana raised Kailash mountain along with Mahadev in his hands, he also felt very proud that if he can raise Kailash mountain along with Mahadev, then there is no other impossible for him and his balance as soon as Ravana kept his balance
 Shook but even after that, he kept on in his body and in such a time, the devi slipped once again, he got angry and cursed Ravana that "hey arrogant Ravan tu aaj Area will be counted monsters Kyuँki your nature went're like demons and ye are arrogant
 Ravana did not pay attention to the words of Devi Sati, then Lord Shiva started to increase his weight and with that weight Ravan started to place Mount Kailash slowly on the same place and with the weight he had one hand and he ached
 Shouted, the sound of his shouting was heard till heaven and he fainted for some time and then on regaining consciousness he praised Lord Mahadev's beautiful "jatatvigaljajalpravahpavitsthal throat" Bitan Bhujngtungmalikam 


 Bholenath's praise pleased passes said that Ravana though i know the world of the macabre dance called the dance act because i would dance'll if anger
 But today you got my mind to dance happily from this beautiful source and beautiful singing
 This source composed and sung by Ravana is called Shiva Tandava source, because the dance of Lord Shiva is called Tandava but he is in anger but in this source, God dances happily
 After this, Lord Shiva pleased Ravana and gave him a sword named Chandrahas, in whose hands no one could defeat him in a battle in three worlds
 Since the curse of the Goddess Sati, Ravana began to be counted among the demons, and there was no harmony with the demons, so pride, wrongdoing in the demonic association went on increasing even more, before the curse he was a Brahmin and used to do satvik austerities
 The work of bringing water to the worship of Brahmadev and Mahadev was also given to the deities
 But later he fell into the Tamasi Prakruti from Satvik and the association of Asuras and Asuras led to the fall of Ravana due to these two reasons
 Other demons raised the benefit of Ravana's name more than Ravana, tax collection in his name, Sidda, Saints and sages started being insulted
 The demons used to remove their hatred from the gods, they sometimes cows and Brahmins, because there are very few gods left in heaven, perhaps the gods are Brahmins by changing this form and helping the gods to become saints
 Started giving and killing everyone
 ramayana ke anusaar ravan ke pita vishrava the to rishi pultsay ke putr the
 Ravana's mother was Kaikasi, who belonged to the demon clan, so Ravana was the child of Brahmin father and demonic mother, and Ravana, despite having excelled in many disciplines, Vedas, Puranas, Niti, Philosophy, Indrajal, etc
, his tendencies were demonic and terror all over the world
 Used to stir
 daanvon ko pataa chalaa ki unka bhaanja ravan akele hi swarg main sabhi devataaon ko parrast kar diya tino lokon main is baat kaa pataa chalaa or is baat se daanav bahut khush ho gayi unki varsho kii manokamana purna ho gayi or daanvon ne ravan kii jai jayakaar kii or ravan ko apana raja banane ki prarthana kii
 ravan ke tej or uske bhavy swaroop or netritv se may daanav ne prasann ho ke apni atyant sundar or maryaada kaa paalan karne vaali putree mandodari kaa vivaah ravan ke saath kiya or ravan patni rup main mandodari ko paa ke prasann hua
 pativrata naariyon main mandodari kaa sthaan devi ahilya ke samakaksh he Once Narada ji came to Lanka again, Ravana served him very well, Narada ji said to Ravana, "have you heard that you are stronger than Mahadev, Ravan said yes, you are right
" Narada said how much strength he could get

 Ravana liked Narada's words and said, Maharishi, if i bring Mahadev along with Mount Kailash to the loot of the desert, how will it be? With this, i will know how much strength is there inside me
 Narada Ji said that the idea is not bad and went away after that
 One day Ravana tried to take Mahadev along with Kailash to Lanka on the strength of devotion and power
 As soon as she raised the mountain of Kailash in her hands, the devi sati started sliding, she said loudly, stop! He asked Mahadev about this, why is this Kailash being shaken by Mahadev, Mahadev said that Ravana is trying to take us to Lanka

 ravan ke naam kaa phayda oothaya duusare rakshason ne, uske naam par kar vasuuli, sidd, santon muni janon kaa apmaan hone laga
 rakshason ne devataaon se apana bair nikaalane ke liye, wo kabhi gaayon ko or brahmanon isaliye ki, swarg main bahut kam devtaa hi rah gayi he shaayad ye rup badal kar devtaa hi brahman hai or sant ban ke devataaon kii madad kar rahe hai rakshas jahaan tahaan sabhi ko traas dene or maarane lage
 jisase prithvi par bhaar or batch gaya
 lekin ravan ne in sab par dhyaan nahin diya
 After defeating many kings Maharajas, Dasgriva reached Anaranya, the king of Ikshvaku dynasty who ruled over Ayodhya
 usne unhen bhi dwand yuddh karne athwa paraajay sweekaar karne ke liye lalakaara
 Both fought fiercely, but Ravana could not be defeated by Brahmaji's boon
 jab anrany kaa sharir buree tarah se kshat-vikshat ho gaya to ravan ikshvaku vansh kaa apmaan or uphaas karne laga
 Annoyed by this, Ananya cursed him that you have insulted the Ikshvaku dynasty with his sarcastic words, so i curse you that in this lineage of Mahatma Ikshvaku, dasharatha-nandan Rama will be born who will kill you
 yah kah kar raja swarg sidhaar gayi
 Having got elusive powers, he once roamed the region of monkeys
 It was evening, Bali, the king of the apes, was chanting evening under a tree
 ravan use dekh kar hansaa or phir use chhedne laga i mercut, i bandar bol uskaa uphaas karne laga or yuddh karne ke liye uksaane laga
 ravan ko apni mayavi shakti par ghamand aa gaya tha wo baali se kaha are mercut maine suna he tu bahut shaktishaalee he aa jaraa mujhase yudd kar ke dekh tera abhimaan main kaise dhilaa karata hoon
 lekin baali dhyaan main tha isaliye usne isaki baat ko suna hi nahin
 iske baad ravan ne usko jor se laat maari or bolaa paakhandee mere lalkaarane ke baad mere dar se dhyaan main baitha he, sidhe-sidhe bol ki main nahin lad saktaa
 baali krodh se oobal pada usne ravan ko patake-patake kar itani maar maari bas wo sirf marane se hi bachaa or phir use apni punch main band kar lapet liya, pun: sandhya vandan samaapt karke usne ravan ke garv ko chur-chur kar diya
 chha: maheene tak baali ne use apni kaid main rakhaa ek din use apane baane haath se usko apni kaankh main dabaakar baali ja rahaa tha tabhi uske haath kii pakad dhili ho gayi or ravan bhaag niklaa aisa bhaaga kii dikhaai nahin diya
 ab ravan ko pataa chalaa ki usase bhi balashaali log hai mujhe hi pitamah kii vajah se abhimaan zyada tha

 In order to calculate the cost per kilometer of an electric vehicle, it is necessary that a monetary value should be given to the loss in the battery
 This is difficult due to the fact that every time the battery is charged at a lower capacity, and its life is considered to end when the owner of the vehicle does not accept its charging capacity
 And even after that the 'life-span' battery is not completely useless, it can be used for other purposes, recycled or kept as an additional battery
