 Viscosity is the property of a liquid that causes it to resist deforming due to an external stressor or a molar stress
 saamaanya shabdon main, yah us taral ke gaadhepan yaa uske bahane kaa pratirodh karne kii kshamta kaa parichaayak he
 For example, water is thin and its viscosity is less than that of vegetable oil which is thick
 shyanta aam taur par yah dekha jaataa he ki sabhi vastuen, chaahe ve gas, drav athwa thos hon, yadi unka virupan hota he, athwa unke pind ke vibhinn hisson main saapeksh gati karai jaati he, to unamem avrodh karne kii pravriti hoti he
 Some items have more of this tendency and some have less
 jab ham pani ko chikani sataha par giraate hai, to yah dekha jaataa he ki pani teji se bahata he, lekin yadi ham shira yaa glisreen kii utani hi maatra usee prakaar kii chikani sah par giraayen, to yah sataha par failane main zyada samay letaa he
 Objects of molasses, which take a long time to spread, are called viscous or viscous in the language of everyday people, while objects like water are termed as liquid or moving
 is prakaar ham yah kah sakate hai ki shira pani se zyada shyaan he
 In other words, it is also said that the transformation occurs slowly in molasses, while faster in objects like water
 shyanta taralon kaa vah gun he jiske kaaran taral un baan kaa virodh karata he jo uske swaroop ko badalanaa chaahate hai
 In this way, we can also see viscosity as the internal friction of any fluid or gas
 dravon tathaa gaison, donon main, shyanta kaa gun paaya jaataa he, lekin drav gaison kii apeksha zyada shyaan hote hai
 Due to this viscosity, one layer of fluid moves through another layer
 jab jahaaj pani par vicharan karata he, tab samudr kaa pani shyaan avrodh prastut karata he
 Similarly, wind also obstructs the path of our airplanes and cars
 hamaari kalam kii syaahi kii visheshta kaaphi had tak uski shyanta par nirbhar he
 The basis for the use of lubricants is viscosity
 ham sab logon kii dhamniyon tathaa shiraaon main rudhirparisancharan rudhir kii shyanta par hi nirbhar karata he
 Thus viscosity plays an important role in public life
 do aisi aseemit samaantar patticoon kii kalpana karen jinke bich main ek drav padaarth rakhaa hua he 
 Suppose the plate abcd in its own plane, in the right direction, is moving at a constant velocity v, shown by the arrow in the picture, and the plate a'b'c'd 'is in its steady state
 taatpary yah he ki pattica abcd kaa saapeksh veg va he
 In such a state it is said that the entire velocity of the fluid material is moving in the direction displayed by the arrow from v
 yadi drav kaa pravaah dhararekhi gati se ho rahe ho, to drav kii vah parat jo sthir pattica a'b'c'd' ke sampark main he, achal avasthaa main rahati he, jabaki anya duusari paraton kaa pravaah sataha ke samaantar hota rahata he
 But the velocity of these layers, as we move upwards, gradually increases
 antim parat, jo pattica abcd ke sampark main hoti he, uskaa veg v hi hota he
 Now we will consider any horizontal plane in the fluid
 is samtal ke anuon ko iske thik uuparavaali parat ke anuon dwaara twaran miltaa he, kyonki uuparavaali parat ke anuon kaa veg is samtal ke anuon ke veg se zyada hoto he, jabaki kshaitij samtal ke thik neeche kii parat ke anuon dwaara kshaitij samtal ke anuon kii gati main mandan laayaa jaataa he
 Similarly, each layer of fluid exerts a tangential backward force on the layer directly above it, causing the relative motion between these two layers to be lost
 parinamswaroop yadi hamen drav kii samaantar paraton ke bich saapeksh gati rakhni ho, to yah atyaavashyak he ki ek bahari bal ko is paschkarshan par haaavee hona chahie
 If there will be no external force, then after some time the relative motion between the different layers of the fluid will dissipate
 kisi drav kaa vah gun jiske samarthy kii badaulat, drav apni vibhinn paraton ke bich kii saapeksh gati kaa virodh karata he, drav kii shyanta, athwa aantarik gharshan, kehalaata he
 This property, which differs only in degree or degree from one fluid to another, is an inherent property of each liquid
 dhararekhi gati ke liye, newton ke shyaan pravaah ke niyam ke anusaar, drav kii samanaantar paraton ke bich sparsharekhiy shyaan bal f ko neeche die gaye sambandh dwaara dikhalaayaa jaataa he : f = -h
 A
 dv / dz xxrep 6 
 xxrep 6 
 jahaan a = samantar paraton kaa kshetrafal, dz = paraton ke bich kii duuri, dv = paraton kii saapeksh gati, dv / dz = veg pravanta tathaa h ek sthiraank he, jise "drav kii shyanta kaa gunank" kaha jaataa he
 This, or its value, depends on the nature of the fluid and the physical conditions
 yadi ham upar darshaae gaye sambandh main a = 1, dv / dz = 1 rakhen, to f = -h hoga
 Hence the definition of "coefficient of viscosity" of a fluid can be given as follows: yadhyapi upar do patticoon tathaa unke bich drav kii upasthiti jaisi vyavastha kii kalpana kar, aasaani se "shyanta ke gunank" kii paribhaasha kii gai he, tathaapi prayogtmak rup main aisi vyavastha ko paanaa sambhav nahin he
 Initially the "coefficient of viscosity" of liquid objects such as water was measured by measuring the flow of water after passing through capillary tubes, and this method is still widely used today
 maan lijie ki, koi drav, jaise pani, kisi vrittiya chhed kii sankeern nalee se hokar guzar rahaa he
 If the water is flowing through a narrow tube at a straight speed and the pressure is uniform over a transverse passage of the tube and the layer of fluid that is in contact with the spherical wall of the tube and is experimentally stable, the viscosity of the water Can be extracted by the following relation: jahaan q = pani kaa vah aaytan jo prati second nalee se hokar gujarata he, r = sankri nalee kaa ardhavyas δ p { \ displaystyle { \ Delta p}} = dabaav kaa antar jo nalee ke donon siron ke bich hota he, l = sankeern nalee kii lambaai tathaa η { \ displaystyle { \ eta }} = shyanta kaa gunank he
 It has been found by experiments that, to a large extent, the viscosity of liquids is dependent on temperature
 yadhyapi is kshetra main kaaphi prayog kiye ja chuke hai, tathaapi koi aisa saadhaaran sutara nahin mila jo shyanta tathaa taap ke sambandh kii ucch yatharthata ko pradarshit kare
 It is often found that viscosity decreases with increasing temperature throughout the area, but this decrease in viscosity per fraction is greater than the higher temperature at lower temperatures
 shyanta tathaa taap ke sambandh main sarvapratham slot dwaara ek mulanupati sutara diya gaya, jo baad main sanshodhit hua tathaa shuddh dravon ke sambandh main hi lagu hota he
 Later on Andrade's theory was given a complex viscosity-temperature relationship, which has been found to be quite satisfactory by experiments and is as follows: h v1 / 3 = aec / vt xxrep 5 
 xxrep 5 
 xxrep 4 
 Where a and c are constants, t = temperature and v = specific volume
 taap ke badhane ke saath saath gaison kaa shyanta kaa gunank badhata he
 In relation to this Sutherland gave a formula which is as follows: jahaan: For liquids that have high viscosity, such as mineral oil, their viscosity coefficient increases with increasing pressure
 keval pani ko chhodkar anya sabhi dravon main kareeb kareeb aisi hi sthiti pai gai he
 The viscosity decreases in water up to several hundred air pressures first, then its viscosity increases with pressure like other liquids
 gaison ke bare main yah paaya gaya he ki saadharantaya ucch dabaav kaa shyaantagunank par koi prabhaav nahin padataa, kintu nune dabaav par shyaantagunank dabaav ke ghatane ke saath saath hi ghatata jaataa he
 The pressure at which this effect begins depends on two things: sarvapratham thomas graham ne yah suzav diya ki ek hi prakaar kii rachana ke yogicon kaa shyanta gunank niyamit dhang se bad saktaa he, yadi unke anuon yaa samoohon kii sankhya badhaai jaae
 Through experiments, Thorpe and Rodger found that the viscosity of a homogeneous series increases with its atomic mass
 yah vruddhi niyamit dhang se hoti he, jabaki sajaateey shrenee ke pratham do yaa teen yogic aniyamata darshaate hai
 Barring bacteria and indigo green algae, all unicellularly scattered island-celled cells in the cytoplasm of living plant and animal cells are called nematodes or mitochondria
 koshika ke andar sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se dekhne main ye gol, lambe yaa andakar dikhte hai
 Mitochondria are found in all creatures and in all types of cells
 mitocandrian yaa sutarakanika koshika ke koshikadravya main upasthit dohari jhilli se ghira rahata he
 Within the mitochondria there is DNA in the form of genetic material which is a matter of surprise and discovery for scientists
 mitocandria main upasthit diene kii rachana evam aakaar jeevanuon ke diene ke samaan he
 It is estimated that millions of years ago, a bacterium may have entered a human cell and in the course of time it made the cell a permanent residence
 mitocandria ke diene evam koshikaon ke kendrak main vidyaman diene main 35-38 jin ek samaan hai
 Due to their DNA, mycondria can increase their number on their own when needed within the cell
 santano kii koshikaon main paaya jane vaala mitocandria unhen unki mata se praapt hota he
 The sperm does not play a role in the DNA found in the mitochondria of fertilized eggs
 he
 Respiratory activity occurs in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of each living cell
 shwasan sambandhit praarambhik kriyaayein cytoplasm main hoti he tathaa shesh kriyaayein mitocandriaon main hoti hai
 Since most of the energy is produced in the last phase of the action itself
 isliye mitocandria ko koshika kaa shwasanang yaa 'shakti grih' kaha jaataa he
 The branch of biology provides a detailed description of cytology or cell biology

 Ices: varun, naptune yaa napchayune hamaare saura mandal main surya se aathvaan grah he
 It is the fourth largest planet in the solar system by diameter and the third largest planet by mass
 varun kaa dravyaman prithvi se 17 guna adhik he or apane padosi grah arun se thodaa adhik he
 According to the celestial unit, Varuna's orbit is at an average distance of 30
1 km from the sun, that is, Varun is about thirty times more than the sun in comparison to the Earth
 varun ko suraj kii ek puri parikrama karne main 164
79 varsh lagate hai, yani ek varun varsh 164
79 prithvi varshon ke baraabar he
 The four planets in our solar system are called gas demons, because they contain mostly gas instead of clay and stone and they are very large in size
 varun iname se ek he - baaki teen brihaspati, shani or arun hai
 Of these, Arun's texture is very similar to Varun
 arun or varun ke vaataavaran main brihaspati or shani ke tulana main barf adhik he - pani kii barf ke atirikt inamen jami hui ammonia or methane gaison kii barf bhi he
 So sometimes astronomers put these two in the category called "icy Gas Monsters"
 varun pehla grah tha jisaki astitv kii bhavishyavaanee use bina kabhi dekhe hi ganit ke adhyayan se kii gayi thi or jise phir us aadhaar par khoja gaya
 This happened when some strange disturbances were found in Arun's orbit, which could only mean that an unknown neighbor is exerting its gravitational influence on him
 khagol main khojbin karne ke baad yah agyaat grah 23 sitambar 1846 ko pehali dafaa doorabeen se dekha gaya or iskaa naam "naptune" rakh diya gaya
 "neptune" was the god of the sea in the ancient Roman religion, the place of the god "varuna" in ancient India, so this planet is called Varuna in Hindi
 roman dharm main naptune ke haath main trishul hota tha isliye varun kaa khagolashastriy chinh ♆ he
 Where the planet Arun looks like just a sphere with no marks or spots on it, there is a clear cloud, storm and change of weather on Varun
 mana jaataa he ke varun par tufaani hawa saura mandal ke kisi bhi grah se zyaada tej chalati he or 2,100 kimi prati ghanta tak kii gatiyaan dekhi ja chuki hai
 When the Voyager II vehicle passed by Varun in 1989, Varun saw a "big thick spot", which has been compared to Jupiter's "big red spots"
 kyonki varun suraj se itnaa dur he, isliye uskaa upree vayumandal bahut hi thanda he or vahaan kaa taapmaana -128 °centegrade tak gir saktaa he
 Due to its large size, the temperature of the planet reaches 5,000 ° c due to the severe pressure of its gravity in the center of the planet
 varun ke ird-gird kuch chhitare-se upgrahi challe bhi hai jinhen wayager dwitiya ne dekha tha
 The light blue color of Varuna comes from the methane gas present in its upper atmosphere
 neptune evam surya ke bich kii ausat duuri 4

 On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first mass-centric En orbit since its discovery in 1846, although it did not show in its exact position in our skies, as the Earth was in a different location in its 365
25-day orbit
 Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 july Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the Sun; if the more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 july 2011

 This is a secret parameter for a particular message exchange context
 Keys are very important because ciphers without variable keys are brittle and therefore less useful to most members

 They were used without any additional processes such as authentication or integrity checks
 bolchaal kii bhashaa main "code yaa kuta " shabd kaa upyog aksar ancripshan kii kisi bhi vidhi ke arth main yaa arth ko chupaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 However, code or code has a more specific meaning in cryptography or cryptography; It means the replacement of a unit of common text with a code word
 kuta kaa upyog ab gambhir kutalekhan main nahin kiya jaataa he-ikai padon ke rup main aisi chizon ke liye sanyogvash hone vaale apwaadon ke alaava
 - Because properly selected ciphers are more practical and more secure than the best codes and are more receptive to computers

 Modern examples of steganography are the use of invisible ink, micro dot and digital watermarks to hide information
 clasical sifer ke dwaara utpann sifer text hameshaa plane text ke bare main sankhyikeey soochna prakat karte hai, jiskaa upyog aksar unhen todane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In the 9th century, almost all such ciphers became more or less brittle by a known attacker after the discovery of frequency analysis by the Arab mathematician Polymath, Al Kindi
 is tarah ke clasical sifer abhi bhi lokapriy hai, haalaanki adhikansh paheli ke rup main hai ) multah sabhi sifer kript analysis ke liye kamjor bane rahe, jab tak 1467 main leon battista alberty ne spasht rup se poli alpha betic gughalekh kaa vikaas nahin kiya haalaanki is baat kaa sanket he ki yah pracheen arab ganitagya jaise al-kindi ke liye gyaat tha
 Alberti's new technology used different ciphers for different parts of the message, he also discovered perhaps the first automatic cipher device, a wheel that executes the partial sensation of his invention
 bahu varni vigener sifer main encripshan ek kunjee shabd kaa prayog karata he, jo us varna pratisthaapan ko niyantrit karata he jis ke aadhaar par kunjee shabd ke varna kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Babbage in the mid-1800s demonstrated that these types of multi-cipher ciphers are partially vulnerable to detailed frequency analysis techniques
 haalaanki aavriti vishleshan kai cifron ke viruddh ek shaktishaalee or saamaanya takanic he, fir bhi encripshan praayogic rup se prabhaavshaalee tha; kai bhavi encripshan vigyaani is takanic se agyaat the
 Breaking a message without using frequency analysis was essential knowledge for the cipher used, and perhaps also for the key involved in the action
 is prakaar jasusi, rishwatakhori, chori, dharmatyag aadi adhik aakarshak drushtikon ban gaye
 In the 19th century it was finally recognized that the secrecy of the cipher's algorithm is not a sensing modality or practical protection; In fact it was later felt that the appropriate cryptographic scheme should be preserved even if the adversary fully understood the cipher algorithm
 kunjee kii gopneeyata ek hamale ke antargat gopneeyata banaaye rakhane ke liye, ek achche sifer ke liye paryaapt honi chahie
 This basic principle was first clearly established in 1883 by Auguste Karkhof and commonly known as the Karkhof theory; Alternatively and more explicitly it was re-established by Claude Shennon, inventor of the basic laws of information theory and theoretical cryptography, he also gave 'the Enemy Knows the System' as Shennon's Maxim

 In addition, computers allow for encryption in any binary format, in contrast to classical ciphers that could only encrypt written language text

 In a 1976 ground-breaking paper Whitefield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public key cryptography
 jisamen do alag lekin ganitiya rup se sambandhit kusiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he; ek saarvajanik kunjee or nijee kunjee
 The public key is constructed in such a way that the computation of one key is impractical from another
 fir bhi ve aavashyak rup se sambandhit hai
 Instead, the two keys are generated secretly, as an unrelated pair

 Diffie and Hellman demonstrated that public key cryptography is possible by displaying the diffie-hellman key exchange protocol

 In 1997, it became publicly known that asymmetric key cryptography was discovered by James H

 In addition to encryption, public key cryptography can also be used to implement digital signature schemes
 ek digital hastakshar ek saadhaaran hastakshar kii yaad taaja karata he; un donon ke paas aise lakshan hote hai ki ek upyogkarta ke liye unka utpaadan asana hota he, lekin kisi or ke liye jaalsaji karnaa mushkil hota he
 Digital signatures can be permanently tied to the component of the message being signed; Then they cannot be sent from one document to another for any effort
 digital hastakshar yojanaon main, do elgoritham hote hai; ek hastakshar ke liye jisamen sandesh par kaarywahi karne ke liye ek gupt kunjee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or doosraa satyaapan, ke liye jisamen hastakshar kii vaidyata kii jaanch karne ke liye sandesh ke saath ek saarvajanik milan kunjee prayukt kii jaati he

 Due to the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public key algorithms involve activities such as modular multiplication and optimization
 jo adhikansh block sifers vishesh rup se praroopik kunjee aakaar se yukt block sifers main prayukt takneekon kii tulana main compyutational rup se adhik manhage hote hai
 As a result, public key crypto systems are usually hybrid crypto systems, in which a rapid high-quality symmetric key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the corresponding symmetric key is sent along with the message, but the public key algorithm It is encrypted using

 The purpose of cryptanalysis is to detect any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a cryptographic scheme
 is prakaar se iske upsanskaran kii anumati dena
 It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken
 cloude shannon ne bel leboratories main unke dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke kaary ke sambandh main sabit kiya ki ek samay pad sifer bhangur nahin he, unhone bataaya ki mul padaarth yadrichhik hote hai or fir se kabhi bhi kaam main nahin liye ja sakate hai or bataaya ki isamen sabhi sambhav hamalavar hote hai or inaki lambaai sandesh ke baraabar yaa usase adhik hoti he
 Most ciphers other than a time pad, can be broken by a substantial computational effort by brute force attack, but the amount of effort required may exponentially depend on the size of the key, compared to the effort required to use the cipher, such In that case, effective protection can be achieved if it is proved that the effort required is beyond the capacity of any opponent
 arthath, yah darshaya janaa chahie ki sifer ko todane ke liye koi prabhavi vidhiyaan nahin khoji ja sakati he
 Since no such demonstrations are currently conducted, the one-time tree is the only theoretically unbreakable cipher in today's time
 kriptanalisis hamalon kii kai kismein hai or inhen kai tareekon se vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 a general distinction is made based on what an attacker knows and what capabilities are available
 sifer text ekmaatr hamale main, krypto vishleshak ke liye keval sifer text uplabdh hota he
 In, the cipher text and its associated plane text are available to the crypt analyzer
 In a selected plane text attack, the crypt analyzer selects a plane text and studies the cipher text associated with it; An example of this is gardening used by the British during World War II
 antat ek chaynit sifer text hamale main kript vishleshak sifer text ke chayan or isse sambandhit plane text kaa adhyayan karne main sakasham hota he
 Also often such mistakes occur in the use or design of one; For some historical examples, see Enigma's Cryptanalysis) samamit kunjee sifer ke kript analysis main praroopik rup se shaamil he stream sifer yaa block sifer ke viruddh hamalon kii khoj karnaa
 It is more effective than any attack against a skilled cipher
 udhaaharan ke liye, di i es ke viruddh ek saadhaaran broot force hamale ko ek gyaat plane text or 2 55 dikripshan kii zarurat hoti he, yah us bindu par pahunchne ke liye lagbhag aadhi sambhav kunjiyon par prayaas karata he jahaan behatar sambhaavnaaen hoti hai
 But this does not give sufficient assurance; a linear crypt analysis against DES requires 2 43 known plane text and approximately 2 43 DES activities
 yah broot force hamalon par ek acha sudhaar he
 Public key algorithms are based on the computational complexity of different problems
 inamen se sabase prasiddh he purnank gunan khand 
 But discrete logarithm problems are also very important
 adhikansh saarvajanik kunjee kript vishleshan, in computesnal samasyaon, yaa unamem se kuch ko prabhavi rup se sulajhane ke liye sankhyikeey elgoritham kaa upyog karte hai
 
 udhaaharan ke liye, asatat laghuganak ke dirghavrittiya vakr aadhaarit sanskaran ko hal karne ke liye sarvottam gyaat elgoritham bahut adhik samay lete hai, isaki tulana main gunan khand ke liye sarvottam gyaat elgoritham saamaan aakaar kii samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye kam samay lete hai
 In this way, encryption techniques based on multiplication blocks should use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques in order to achieve the equivalent resistance to resistance to attack
 isi kaaran se, dirghavrittiya vakr par aadhaarit saarvajanik kunjee krypto pranali 1990 ke madhya main hui khoj se bahut lokapriy ho gayi he
 When pure cryptanalysis uses a weakness of the algorithm, other attacks on the crypto system are based on the use of algorithms in real devices and are called side chain attacks
 yadi ek kript vishleshak ke liye samay kii maatra uplabdh he or upkaran ne plane text kii ek sankhya ko encript kiya, yaa usne ek password yaa pin kerector main kisi truti kaa pataa lagaaya, to vah ek sifer ko todane ke liye ek timming atek kaa upyog kar saktaa he, jo vishleshan ke liye pratirodhi he
 An attacker can also study the length and pattern of the message to obtain important information; This is called traffic analysis, and can be very useful for a warning conflict

 By 1999, France significantly prohibited the domestic use of cryptography, although it granted concessions to many of them

 There are strict restrictions on the use of cryptography in many countries

 In the United States, cryptography is legal for home use, but there are many differences on legal issues related to cryptography

 Many Western countries have strictly regulated the export of cryptography in some places, possibly due to the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for continued national security

 pyaar yaa prem ek ahsaas he
 Love is a mixture of many emotions, attitudes that extend from mutual affection to happiness
 ye ek majboot aakarshan or nijee judaav kii bhaavana he
 It can also be considered as a way of presenting one's compassion, feeling and affection
 khud ke prati, yaa kisi jaanavar ke prati, yaa kisi insaan ke prati snehapurvak kaary karne yaa jataane ko pyaar kah sakate hai
 It is said that if there is love then our life changes
 pracheen greekon ne chaar tarah ke pyaar ko pahachaanaa he: rishtedaari, dosti, romani ichha or divya prem
 Love is often compared with lust and weighed with romantic adultery as a reciprocal relationship; love is also weighed with friendship
 aam taur par pyaar ek ehsaas he jo ek insaan duusare insaan ke prati mahasoos karata he
 If we talk about love, then love is life just as h + o2 = H2o is, in the same way that love also creates life between two people
 prem ek rasayan he kyonki yah yantra nahin vilyan he,drashtaa or drushti kaa
 Only the scenes of beauty merge into the sight of the seer, and this state is the state of love
 prem or soundarya dono kii utpatti or uddipan kii prakriya antar se prarambh hoti he
 Beauty affects the personality of man, truth is eternal, and love resides in that beauty
 prem main aasakti hoti he
 If there is no attachment, then love becomes devotion rather than love
 prem moh or bhakthi ke bich kii avasthaa he
 a person can love an object, or an element, or a target with which he is connected or respected
 insaan kisi vastu, jaanavar yaa kaary se bhi pyaar kar saktaa hai jiske saath wo nijee judaav mahasoos karata he or khud ko jude rakhana chahta he
 Impersonal love is not like normal love, it is the soul's attitude of human beings that creates a peaceful mental attitude towards others, which is expressed by gestures of kindness, restraint, forgiveness and compassion
 agar saamaanya vaakya main kaha jaae to avaiyaktik pyaar ek vyakti ke dusron ke prati vyavhaar ko kaha jaataa hai
 Therefore, impersonal love is based on the human mind of an object
 manushya ke bich ke pyaar ko parsparik pyaar kehete hai
 It is not just a desire for each other, but a powerful emotion
 jis pyaar ke bhaawanaaon ko vinimay nahin kiya jaataa use apratideya pyaar kehete hai
 Such love is found among family members, friends and lovers

 Helen Fisher is a leading love expert
 unhonen pyaar ke tajurbe ko teen hisson main vibhaajan kiya hai: havas, aakarshan, aasakti
 Lust is sexual desire
 romani-aakarshan nirdhaarit karti he ki aapke saathi main aapako kya aakarshith karata he
 Attachment includes living the house, parental duty, mutual protection and a sense of security
 vaasana praarambhik aveshpurna yon ichha he, jo sambhog ko badhaava detaa he
 It promotes intercourse and the release of chemicals
 iskaa prabhaav kuch hafte yaa mahinon tak hi hota he
 Attraction is a personal and romantic desire towards a single human being that emanates from lust
 isse ek vyakti se patibaddhta badhati he
 As humans start making love, there is a release of a type of chemical in their brain
 manushya ke mastishk main sukhon ke kendra ko uttejit karata he
 Due to this, the heart beats increase, there is no appetite, no sleep and intense feeling of excitement
 aasakti aisa lagaav he jisase saalon rishton kii badhotaree hoti he
 Attachment depends on commitment such as marriage, children, or friendship
 manovigyaan main sangyanatmak or samaajik ghatana ko darshaya jaataa he
 Psychologist Robert Sternberg has formulated the triangular principle of love
 unhone tark kiya ke pyaar ke teen bhinn prakaar ke ghatak hai: atmiyata, patibaddhta or josh
 Affinity is the element in which two human beings share their confidence and personal details of their lives
 ye zyaadaatar dosti or romani kaary main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Commitment is an expectation that this relationship will last forever
 aakhir main yon aakarshan or josh he
 Passionate love is shown in romantic love and attachment

 Finally, the three join in consummate love
 vikasvaadi manovigyaan ne pyaar ko jivit rahane kaa ek pramukh saadhan sabit karne ke liye anek kaaran diya hai
 According to them, humans rely more on their parental support than other mammals during their lifetime, because of this love has also been considered as a mechanism to propagate parental support
 ye isaliye bhi ho saktaa hai, kyonki pyaar ke kaaran yon sanchaarit rog ho saktaa he jisaki vajah se manushya ke janankshmata par asar pad saktaa hai, bhrun par chot aa sakati hai, bachche paidaa karte vaqt ulajhanein bhi ho sakati hai ityadi
 After knowing all these things, the practice of polygamy in the society can stop

 kisi adhik garm pind se kisi adhik thande pind main ooshmaa ke pargaman ko ooshmaa antaran kehete hai
 When the temperature of an object is different from that of its surroundings or other object, the transmission of heat energy, also known as the flow of heat or exchange of heat, takes place in such a way that the object and its surroundings take heat-equilibrium
 ; This means that both have the same temperature
 ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam yaa clogiyas ke kathan ke anusaar ooshmaa kaa sanchaar hameshaa adhik garm vastu se adhik thandi vastu kii ore hota he
 Wherever there are variations of temperature in nearby objects, heat communication between them can never be stopped; It can only be reduced
 padaarth ke kanon main sighe sampark se ooshmaa ke sanchaar ko sanchaalan kehete hai
 The transmission of energy may occur primarily by suppressive combustion such as in liquids or by osmosis as in metals or by phonon vibrations as in insulators
 anya shabdon main, jab aasapaas ke parmaanu ek duusare ke prati kampan karte hai, yaa electron ek parmaanu se duusare main jate hai tab ooshmaa kaa sanchaar sanchaalan dwaara hota he
 Conduction is more common in solids, where a mesh of relatively stable spatial relationships between atoms helps in the transmission of energy between them by vibration
 aisi sthiti main jahaan drav kaa pravaah bilkul bhi na ho rahaa ho, taap sanchaalan, drav main kanon ke paraasaran se sidhe anuroop hota he
 This type of heat osmosis differs from nodular osmosis occurring in solids in behavior, whereas codis osmosis is mostly confined to liquids
 dhaatuen saamanytah taap urja kii sarvottam sanchaalak hoti hai
 This is due to the way the metals are chemically bonded; Metallic bonds contain freely moving electrons that can rapidly transmit heat energy to a metal
 jaise-jaise ghanatv ghatata he, sanchaalan bhi ghatata he
 Therefore, fluids are less conductors
 aisa gas main parmaanuon ke bich adhik duuri hone se hota he: parmaanuon ke bich kam takaraav hone kaa matlab he, kam sanchaalan
 taapmaana ke saath gaison ke bad jaati he kii chaalakata
 gaison kii sanchaalakata nirvaat se dabaav ke badhane ke saath ek mahatvapurn bindu tak tab tak badhati he jab tak ki gas kaa ghanatv itnaa ho jaae ki gas ke anu ek sataha se duusare main taap kaa sanchaar karne ke pehle ek duusare se takaraane lagen
 ghanatv main is bindu ke baad, badhate hue dabaav or ghanatv ke saath sanchaalan jaraa sa hi badhata he
 To calculate how easily a particular medium operates, engineers use thermal conductivity, also known as the conductance constant or the operation multiplier, k
 ooshm sanchaalakata main k kii paribhaasha he – ‘taapmaana main bhinnata ke kaaran samay main kisi sthaan kii sataha se saamaanya disha main kisi motaai main se sancharit taap kii maatra, Q’
 ooshm sanchaalakata ek padaartheey gun he jo praathmik taur par madhyam kii avasthaa, taapmaana, ghanatv or anvik bonding par nirbhar hota he
 a heat pipe is a passive device that is constructed in such a way that it appears to have extremely high thermal conductivity
 sthir avasthaa ke sanchaalan main ek bhaag main pravesh kar rahaa taap usase baahar nikal rahe taap ke baraabar hota he
 In the steady state operation, all the rules of direct electric conduction apply to 'flow of heat'
 aise maamalon main ‘ooshm pratikultaaon’ ko vidyut pratikultaaon ke samaan mana ja saktaa he
 Temperature plays the role of voltage and is synonymous with transmitted thermal current
 jab kabhi bhi kisi vastu kaa bhitari taap sanchaalan uski parisima ke taap sanchaalan se kaaphi teji se hota he to samuhik pranali vishleshan dwaara asthir sanchaalan kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This regression method reduces one aspect of an unstable operating system appropriately
 is vidhi main biot number naamak ek pad kaa gananaa kii jaati he jisko kisi vastu kii bhinn taapmaana ke ek samaan prakshalan vaali seemaa par hone vaale taap sanchaalan ke prati avrodh or vastu ke aantarik sanchaalak taap avrodh ke anupaat ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 When the thermal resistance is transferred to the object of heat, the resistance is less than the heat being completely diffused within the object, at least the Biot number is 1
 In this case, Biot numbers are also specifically for the smaller, The approximation of the spatially uniform temperature within the object can be used to start the object, since it can be assumed that the heat is transferred uniformly to the uniformly distributed time
 For, as to do so due to low resistance, entered the object to compare with the heat resistance
 upyogi rup se sahi upgaman or taap sanchaar vishleshan ke liye biot number saamanytah 0

 saath hi iskaa prayog aaraam ke str ke parivesh main parivartanon ke lagbhag kshanmaatr ke prabhaavon ko nishchit karne ke liye HVAC main kiya jaataa he
 The transmission of heat energy from molecules of one substance to another is called conduction
 taral kii gati ke badhane ke saath-saath samvaahit taap sanchaar bhi badhata he
 The presence of momentum in the magnitude of the fluid promotes the transmission of heat between the solid surface and the liquid
 samvaahit taap sanchaar ke do prakaar hote hai: Convection can also be classified on the basis of internal and external flows
 aantark pravaah tab hota he jab taral kisi thos daayre main band ho jaise kisi pipe main hone vaala pravaah
 bahya pravaah tab hota he jab koi taral bina kisi thos sataha se sampark main aae anishchit kaal tak failata jaataa he
 These two convections, whether natural or forced, can be internal or external because they are independent of each other
 samvaahit taap sanchaar kii dar di jaati he: a is the area of the surface of thermal communication
 t s sataha kaa taapmaana he or t b balk taapmaana par taral kaa taapmaana he
 But t b varies according to the situation and is the temperature of the liquid located 'far away' from the surface
 h sthir taap sanchaar gunak he jo taral ke bhautik gunon jaise taapmaana or bhautik sthiti jisamen sanvaahan hota he, par nirbhar hota he
 Therefore heat communication multiplier should be obtained for every analyzed system
 Several formulas and correlations are available for calculating heat communication coefficients for ideal structures and fluids
 patali part ke pravahon ke liye taap sanchaar gunak ashaant pravahon kii apeksha kam hota he; aisa ashaant pravahon ke taap sanchaar sataha par taral kii adhik patali nishchal part hone ke kaaran hota he
 The communication of heat energy into a space is called radiation
 param shunya ke upar ke taapmaana vaali sabhi vasteen unki pravaahakta guna yadi ve koi kaale rang kii vastu hon to unamem se urja ke vikirit hone kii dar ke baraabar urja kaa vikiran karti hai
 No medium is needed for radiation because it is transmitted by electromagnetic waves; Radiation also works in complete vacuum
 surya kii urja prithvi ko garm karne ke pehle antariksh ke nirvaat main se guzarati he
 The reflectivity and conductivity of all bodies depend on both wavelengths
 planks lau of blike-body radiation ke anusaar taapmaana tivrata kii seemaa tak vidyutchumbakeey vikiran ke tarangadairdhya ke vitaran ko nishchit karata he
 The reflectivity for any body depends on the distribution of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation coming in and therefore the temperature of the source of radiation
 pravaahakta tarangadairghy ke vitaran par or isaliye pind ke taapmaana par nirbhar karti he
 For example, fresh ice, which is highly reflective for visible light, looks white due to reflecting sunlight with peak energy wavelength of about 0
5 micrometer
 parantu kareeb -5 °C taapmaana or 12 micrometer ke sheersh urja tarangadairghy par uski pravaahakta 0
99 hoti he
 Gases absorb and emit energy in specific patterns of wavelength, which vary for each gas
 dikhne vaala prakaash vidyutchumbakeey vikiran kaa ek or prakaar he jo infrared vikiran kii apeksha kam tarangadairghy vaala hota he
 Radiation from objects of visible light and conventional temperatures varies by a factor of about 20 in frequency and wavelength; Both types of emissions are simply different "colors" of electromagnetic radiation
 halke rang or safed vasteen tathaa dhatvik padaarth roshni vaale prakaash kaa avasorana kam karte hai or isaliye kam garm hote hai, lekin anyathaa rosemara ke taapamanon par kisi vastu or uske parivesh ke bich taap sanchaar par rang kaa koi vishesh prabhaav nahin hota he, kyonki prabal utsarjit tarangadairghy dikhne vaale varnakram ke paas nahin hote hai balki kahin dur infrared main hote hai
 The emission at these wavelengths has no relation to the visible emissions; Most items in the far infrared have high emissions
 atah, surya ke prakaash ko chhodkar, kapadon ke rang kaa garmi par koi asar nahin padataa; isi tarah, makaanon par kiye gaye paint ke rang se koi antar nahin padataa he sivaay us bhaag ke, jisapar surya kii roshni padati he
 The main drawback is shiny metallic surfaces with both visible wavelengths and far infrared low emission
 aisi satahen dono dishaao main taap sanchaar kam karne ke liye prayog main laai ja sakati hai; antarikshayan ko pruthkkarit karne ke liye prayukt bahu-partiya pruthakkaarak iskaa ek udhaaharan he
 Low-emissivity windows fitted in houses are made of more complex technology because they have lower emissivity at hot wavelengths while being visible in visible light
 antat taap ko garm yaa thandi vastu ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par bhautik sanchaar karke pravaahit karnaa sambhav he
 It is as easy as heating your bed by pouring hot water in a bottle or changing the ocean waves by the blowing of the iceberg
 ek sambandhit siddhant, newton ke sheetaleekaran ke niyam ke anusaar, kisi bhi vastu ke taap ke hraas kii dar us vastu or uske parivesh ke taapamanon ke bich antar ke anupaat main hoti he 
 yah niyam vishisht sameekaran ke rup main diya gaya he: This type of heat loss formula is sometimes not more accurate; The exact formula requires an analysis of the heat flow based on the heat communication equation in a non-uniform or low conductor medium
 lagaataar kramiktaaon kaa ek anuroop forier kaa niyam he
 The following simplification can be used as per the agreement of the bayot number relating the surface conductivity of the object to the internal heat conductivity
 is anupaat ke anusaar, yah pataa chalata he ki vastu main apekshaakrit adhik aantarik sanchaalakata hoti he, jisase sari vastu ek samaan taapmaana par bani rahati he, haalanki vaataavaran ke dwaara baahar se use thanda karne se yah taapmaana badalata rahata he
 When this happens, these conditions cause an exponential decrease in the temperature of the object over time
 aisi sthiti main, saare pind ko ek pindit capacitence taap sangraahak maan liya jaataa he, jisaki kul taap maatra saral kul taap kshamta c or pind ke taapmaana t se anupatik hoti he, yaa q = c t 
 taap kshamta c ki paribhaasha se sambandh c = dq / dt praapt hota he
 Analyzing this equation in terms of time gives the following identity: dq / dt = C
 This expression can be used in place of dq / dt in the first equation given at the beginning of this section above
 tab, yadi t samay par aise kisi pind kaa taapmaana t he or pind ke parivesh ke vaataavaran kaa taapmaana Tenv he: so: r = ha / c pranali kaa ek sakaaratmak constent vishisht gun he jo 1 / time kii ikai main hona chaiye or isaliye kabhi-kabhi vishisht samay constent t0 ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he: r = 1 / t0 = ΔT / 
 is tarah taap pranaaliyon main, t0 = c / ha 
 Thus the above equation can be usefully written in this way: seemaa kii dashaon ke samavesh or visthaapan ke adarsh tareekon dwaara is sameekaran kaa hal yah he: Here, t t is the time temperature in t and zero time, t = 0 or t is the initial temperature
 "agar" The Newtonian solution is then written as: upyogh udaa
sarlikrut mausam modelon main vayumandal ke taapamanon ko banaae rakhane ke liye purna vikiran code ke sthaan par newtoneey sheetaleekaran kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 An extremely useful principle in heat communication experiments is the representation of heat communication by heat circuits
 a heat circuit is a representation of the resistance to flow of heat as if it were an electrical resistor
 The transmitted heat corresponds to the electric wave and the heat resistance corresponds to the electrical resistor
 taap sanchaar ke vibhinn prakaaron ke liye taap pratirodh kii gananaa viksit samikarnon ke dinaminetaron ke rup main kii jaati he
 Thermal resistors of different types of heat communication are used in the analysis of combined types of heat communication

 Substances with low heat conductivity reduce the flow of heat
 k kaa pariman jitna kam hota he, usase sambandhit taap pratirodh kaa pariman utana hi bada hota he
 The units of heat conductivity are w • m − 1 • k − 1, so the increasing width of insulation decreases the k term and increases the resistance
 yah tarkanusaar sahi he kyonki bade hue sanchaalan path ke saath badha hua pratirodh utpann hota he
 But adding this layer of insulation can increase the surface area and hence the heat conductor area

 taap vinimyak refrijreshan, airkandishning, spes heating, vidyut utpaadan or rasaynic sansaadhan main bade paimaane par prayog main laae jate hai
 a common example of a heat exchanger is a car radiator, in which the heated radiator liquid is cooled by flowing air from the surface of the radiator
 taap vinimyak pravahon ke saamaanya prakaaron main samanaantar pravaah, vipareet pravaah or anuprastha pravaah shaamil hai
 In parallel flow, both fluids flow in the same direction while transmitting heat; In the opposite flow, the liquid flows in opposite directions and in the transverse flow the liquid flows at right angles to each other
 taap vinimyak ke liye saamaanya rachanaaon main kavach or nalee, doharaa pipe, extroded phind pipe, spiral fin pipe, you-tub or stacked plate shaamil hai
 When engineers calculate the theoretical heat transmission in a heat exchanger, they should keep in mind that the variation of heat between two fluids varies according to the situation

 It is represented as an s-shaped curve corresponding to the variation of surface temperature and the flow of heat
 
 Boiling does not occur at low temperatures and the rate of heat transmission is controlled by single-phase procedures
 jab sataha kaa taapmaana badhata he to sthaneey kvathan hota he or vaashp bulbule kendrit hote hai, aasapaas ke thande taral main badhate hai or foot jate hai
 This is a suboptimal centralized boiling and very effective heat transmission mechanism

 jiske baad hone vaale taap sanchaar ke hraas kaa adhyayan aasaan nahin he lekin yah mana jaataa he ki usamen baari-baari se kendrikrut or film kvathan hota he
 The heat conductivity of the gas state is much lower than the heat conductivity of the liquid state, due to the slowing of the heat circulation due to the formation of the gas condition on the surface of the heater by centralized boiling, thus resulting in a type of "gas heat inhibitor"
 isse ucch taapamanon par, film kvathan kii dravapravagiki ke anusaar shant sthiti utpann hoti he
 The heat flow from the stationary steam layers is at a lower level but they rise slowly with temperature

 Condensation occurs when the vapor cools and converts into a liquid
 kvathan ke samaan hi, sanghanan taap sanchaar kaa udyog main bada mahatv he
 At the time of condensation, the hidden heat of evaporation must come out
 The amount of this heat is the same as that absorbed at the time of evaporation at the same liquid pressure

 There has been a worldwide demand to allow will-death
 medical science main ichha-mrityu yani kisi kii madad se aatmahatya or sahaj mrityu yaa bina ksht ke marane ke vyapak arth hai
 It is defined according to clinical conditions
 voluntary active yuthenesia After the patient's approval, intentionally give such medicines that the patient dies
 It is only valid in the Netherlands and Belgium
 involuntary active yuthenesia If the patient is mentally unable to approve his death, then to give him willful medicines to kill him
 It is also illegal in the whole world
 Passive yuthenesia Discontinuing treatment or removal of life support systems for patient death
 It is considered legal throughout the world

 Some cases related to euthanasia demand in India •terry shiyaavo ke maamle par bahes kii pratidhwani bharat main sunai dene lagi he
 Here also some cases have come up where the patient's relatives or the patient himself expressed his wish for death
 In 2005, Tarkeshwar Sinha, a resident of Bihar Patna, petitioned the Governor to grant mercy death to his wife Kanchanadevi, who has been unconscious since 2000
 •bahucharchit vyankatesh kaa prakaran adhik purana nahin he

 Similarly, mercy death, which may be motivated by human emotion and is to be done to alleviate the unbearable suffering of the victim, is also considered a crime of culpable homicide under Section 304 of Indian Penal Code
 •jeene kaa adhikaar he to marane kaa kyon nahin? The constitutionality of Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code in the case of P
 Rathinam v
 Union of India was objected on the ground that this section is an infringement of Article 21 of the Constitution
 yani jeene kaa adhikaar he to marane kaa bhi adhikaar hona chahie
 But in 1996, the Supreme Court overturned the said decision in Gyanakore v
 State of Punjab and clarified that the right to life does not include the right to life under Article 21

 The Law Commission of India, in its report submitted to the Parliament last year, recommended legalizing the death of mercy
 haalanki ayog ne yah mana he ki is par lambii bahes kii gunzaaish abhi baaqi he or nikat bhavishya main ise manzuri dene kii koi sambhaavna nazar nahin aati
 • 1995 Euthanasia Bill approved in the northern state of Australia
 •1994 main america ke oregon rajya main yuthenesia ko manyata di gai
 • In April 2002, Euthanasia was granted a legal status in the Netherlands in a special condition
 •sitambar 2002 main belgium ne ise manyata di
 • Since 1937, suicide with medical aid in Switzerland has been acceptable
 bharat main ichha-mrityu, samadhi or santhara In order to understand the distinction between euthanasia, suicide and Santhara, we must first classify and understand the distinction of death

 His holy memory is the path of the difficult mission of 'panchajanya'
 ek prakaar se ‘paanchajnya‘ unke chintan tantra kaa akhand pravaah he, unki paavan smriti kaa akshay kendra he
 Being dependent on the spirit of fame-oriented meditational personality like Pandit Deendayal ji, 'panchjanya' continued to grow on his goal path even after being devoid of resources, despite many adverse flows coming from power

 In June 1975, Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency and tried to strangle Indian democracy and in March 1977, only 'panchjanya' could resume her mission
 ‘paanchajnya‘ ke nirbhik swar se tilamilaakar logon evam sarkaar dwaara daayar kiye gaye mukademon kii suchi bahut lambi he

 ‘paanchajnya‘ kii yatra sadhano ke abhaav evam sarkari prakopon ke viruddh rashtriya chetana kii jijeevishaa or sangharsh kii preranadai gaatha he
 It is clear from the motto sentences such as 'the sentinels of nationality', 'the harbinger of cultural chena' or 'the voice of national self-respect and valor' as declared from time to time by 'pachjanya', 'pachjanya' refers to the journey of independent India on the path of national reconstruction The fear of warning the tendencies and powers that threaten to keep them connected to the original motivations of the freedom movement has been repeatedly Am Njata

 Apart from these, 'panchajanya' has made a meaningful attempt to run a debate on national problems by publishing interviews of top leaders of various political parties

 Each issue contains a compilation of thoughtful articles on history, culture and politics
 vishay kendrit visheshankon kii parampara swayan main bahut samrudh or anuthi he
 From the very beginning, 'panchajanya' organized a booklet of three specialties on 'politics', 'earth' and 'society' under the system trilogy

 This tradition continues unabated
 ‘paanchajnya‘ ke visheshank kabhi purnakar, kabhi patrikakaar, to kabhi pustakaakaar main prakashit hue hai
 Being collectible, the readers of 'pachjanya' cherish these specialties as an invaluable fund
 46 varsh lambe katu anubhav ke alok main aaj samvidhan kii samiksha kii charchaa jor pakad rahi he
 But 'panchjanya' published a series of articles of authority scholars in this context from July to September 1959, Jayaprakash Narayan, KA Munshi, Meenu Masani, Meharchand Mahajan, Satyaketu Vidyalankar etc
, highlighting the imperfection of the current constitution
 The need for his review was emphasized

 The publication of his compilation is still worthwhile and purposeful

 But to make his role more influential on the national stage, in 1968 his publication was shifted to Delhi
 1972 main rashtradharm prakaashan ne uskaa prakaashan, mudran pun: lakhanu se karne kaa nishchay kiya
 After the abolition of the Emergency, in 1977, the national religion transferred the full responsibility of its publication to its subsidiary Bharat Prakashan Delhi Limited, to resume publication of 'panchjanya' from Delhi

 Along with independent India, 'panchajanya' is not only its hitchhiker, but is also fully associated with emotion and action in this journey

 In a way, it is 'sayuja Sakhaya' in the language of both the Upanishads and 'mutual Bhavayantu' in the words of the Gita is the destiny of both

 If the star radiates more quickly and is larger, its habitable area will be greater than any smaller or more cold star
 "vaasayogy kshetra" ko angrezi main "habiteble zone" kaha jaataa he
 Inspired by the famous "goldilocks" story in English, the region is sometimes called the "goldilocks Zone"

 All land and tree squirrels are uniquely diurnal, except for newborns of flying squirrels and flying squirrels that feed their babies and who were living as dinners during summer
 Squirrels are nocturnal
 khargosh v hiran ki tarah, gilahariyaan saillulose ko pachaa nahin paati or unhen protein, carbohidrate v vasa ke aadhiky vaale bhojan par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 In temperate regions, early summer is most difficult for squirrels because the seedlings of the sesame seedlings grow at that time and are not available for the squirrels to eat, apart from this there is no other source of food available at this time

 The diet of squirrels consists mainly of many types of plant food, including almonds, seeds, cones, fruits, fungi and green vegetables

 gilahari kaa sarvaadhik purna jeevashm, hesperopits, chadronian ke samay kaa he or aadhunik udan gilahariyon ke saamaan he
 During the latest Eocene to Myocene, there were many squirrels that cannot be placed under the lineage of any living species today
 At least some of these, possibly the oldest, basel, were a type of "proto-squirrels"
 This type of ancient ancestral distribution and variation indicates that squirrels as a group originated from North America
 kabhi-kabhi milane vaale in alpagyaat jeevashmon ke atirikt, jivit gilahariyon kaa jativrutt atyant spasht v saral he
 They have three major lineages, one of which includes the Ratufinae

 tritiy vansh ab tak kaa sabase vishaal vansh he or anya sabhi up pariwaron ko sammilit karata he;iskaa vitaran lagbhag bahudeshiy he
 This supports the hypothesis that the common ancestors of squirrels found through all living and fossils lived in North America, since the same lineage appears to have originated — if, for example, assume that the birth of the squirrels If they were from Eurasia, the clues of their ancient lineages should be found from Africa, but looking at the African squirrels it seems that their The origin is quite modern
 gilahariyon ke mukhya samooh ko teen bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he, jiske dwaara anya up parivaar praapt honge
 The Schiurinae family includes flying squirrels and schiurini, which among others include American tree squirrels; The Sciurini were often seen as a separate family, but they are now seen as a tribe of the Sciurinae

 Whatever the case, the trifurcation of the main squirrel lineage is very convenient in biophysical and ecological terms, with two of the three subfamilies being roughly the same size, each containing around 70–80 species; The third family is twice the other two families
 skiurine ke antargat vrikshiya gilahariyaan aati hai, jo ki america or kuch seemaa tak uresia se hai
 In tropical Asia on the other hand, Kelosquirinae is the most diverse and includes axillary squirrels, but their formation is quite different and they look more "beautiful", which is probably due to the effect of their extremely colorful rows
