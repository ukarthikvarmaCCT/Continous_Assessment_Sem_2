 Rahul Gandhi has said that by March 31, 2020, 22 lakh government vacancies will be filled if his government comes
 number bhi he or dedline bhi
 Can a government take oath on 26 May 2019 and provide jobs to 22 lakh youth by 31 March 2020? Rahul Gandhi seems to have started watching prime time
 yah sahi he ki ham dedh saal se naukari series ke bhavar main fanse hue hai
 We have seen the recruitment of government jobs in every state from Punjab to Bengal and Bihar to Rajasthan, MP to UP
 bina cancil or cese ke koi pariksha or jwining puri nahin hoti he
 Rahul Gandhi made a tweet on 31 March 2019 that by March 31, 2020, 2
2 million vacancies will be filled

 Accordingly, funds will be given to the states from the central government
 alag-alag vibhaagon kii chhodie, central uniwarsity main hazaron pad khaali rah gaye or paanch saal main modi sarkaar nahin bhar pai
 On 21 March 2017 in the Lok Sabha, HR Minister Prakash Javadekar said that within a year 9000 adhoc posts of Delhi University will be filled
 kedra sarkaar kii niti part time rakhane kii nahin he
 9000 posts could not be filled within a university

 So can 20 lakh posts be filled in a year

 Are they giving figures about the whole of India, giving figures about Jammu or just about Akhnoor

 Then the people of Haryana and West UP should tell how many thousands of youth have got jobs in the army and central forces
 hamane pichley saal aktubar kii iconomik times kii ek report dekhi
 This news is written by PTI, some of its main points are that in high level meeting it has been found that 55,000 posts are vacant in six central forces
 siarpief main 21000 or biguef main 16,000 pad khaali hai
 In 2016, 17 lakh 35 thousand youth have been recruited
 agar aap internet search karenge or dhyaan se aankadon ko dekhenge to kaaphi kuch pataa chalegaa
 Now see that in October 2018, PTI was quoted as saying that all the central forces have 55000 vacancies which were ordered to fill up quickly
 6 farvari 2019 ko usee pitiai ke hawaale se usee iconomic times main khabar chhapati he ki kendiy grih mantralay ne ardhsainik balon main 76,578 padon ko bharne ke liye vishesh bhartee abhiyaan chalaaegi
 The October news also says that a special recruitment drive will be conducted to fill 55000 posts

 ritairement, nidhan nae batalian ke banane ke kaaran bhartee hoti rahati he, lekin aapane dekha ki har samay 60 hazaar se adhik vaikency rahati he
 If they were filled in real time, then so many young people would have got jobs before the age passed
 agar bhartee hoti yaa uski prakriya tej hoti to aktubar main 55,000 or farvari main 76,000 vaikency nahin hoti

 Magadh University is in Bihar
 iske asambandh college main kai hazaar chaatro kaa riselt atka hua he
 One is a three-year BA in four years and five years, but their problem is that the state government has stopped the recognition of these colleges
 maamla court main pahunchaa, lekin bich main admician lene vaale chaatro kaa bhavishya atak gaya
 Government jobs have divided the students into different self-interest groups
 sab apni bhartee kii chintaa karte hai
 Otherwise, how was it possible that thousands of young people would have their future ruined
 samay par riselt na aa paane ke kaaran ye log railway kii vaikency nahin bhar sake
 How sorry he must have been

 Get admitted, do something so that the exam gets disputed
 phir cese ho jaae or jwainig na ho

 aaj swaraj india ke anupam ne ek press conference kii he
 Anupam has questioned the extension of two years service to Ashim Khurana, chairman of the Staff Selection Commission
 yah puraa maamla gambhir he
 The government should answer this, the rules were changed in some way to extend the service to SSC Chairman Ashim Khurana
 upiessi ne manaa kar diya, kanoon mantralay ne do-do baar manaa kar diya
 Even after this, service extension is given to Ashim Khurana
 is tarah se hamaare sarkari naukariyon kii bhartee karne vaale aayogon kaa sanchaalan hota he
 Anupam's allegation of Swaraj India is very serious
 ek chairman ko 62 saal kii umr paar kar lene ke baad unhen phir se chayaraman banaae rakhane ke liye cabinet cameti itani betaab kyon he
 Especially during Khurana's tenure, there were allegations of paper leaks, the CBI investigated and the matter is in the Supreme Court
 sansthaaon kii yah tasviir saamne he
 Are Rahul Gandhi really fulfilling his promise to fill 22 lakh government posts by 31 March 2020? aaj dainik bhaskar main anand pandey ne vitt mantri arun jetali kaa intervyuu kiya he
 When Jaitley challenges unemployment figures, Anand asks if you mean employment is not an issue? Finance Minister says that this is not a data query, who is collecting data, what is the slant of it, you will ask three brothers of a farmer family if they have employment then they will say no
 par jab unase puuchhenge ki jeene ke tamaam saadhan hai to ve kahenge ki haa
 Data for both the questions will be different
 yah jawaab dilachasp he
 Be it a means of living, that is air, water, grain, then you are not unemployed
 har berojgaar ke paas jeene kaa saadhan hota he to kya use berojgaar na mana jaae
 Is Jaitley ji's answer really logical? isi intervyuu ke jawaab main jetali ne kaha he ki 35000 kimi haive ke nirmaan main rojgaar paidaa hua hoga
 Do you know how much employment is given in the construction of a kilometer highway today
 kisi haive ko banate dekhiegaa
 Machines work more, man less
 1 april ko dainik bhaskar se vitt mantri kehete hai ki mudra lone main 17 karod log shaamil hai
 But in Telangana, the Prime Minister says that 15 crore people have been given Mudra loans
 pradhanmantri 15 karod kehete hai, vitt mantri 17 karod
 The data in the speeches move slightly
 mudra yani Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) lone kii website par mudra lone ke labhaarthiyon kii sankhya 17 karod hi he
 Its website has state-wise figures, but is there a dispute about whether every issue of loan employment arises
 hindu akhbaar main 22 farvari 2019 ko princila debraj kii ek report chhapi he
 In this, ICRIER fellow Radhicka Kapoor says that every loan does not mean that it is creating a job
 mudra yojana ke tahat ausat lone 45034 rupee kaa hota he
 This amount is too low to create a new job
 itane paise se log khud ke liye kaam paidaa kar pate honge
 newsclick reported on RTI in August 2018 that more than 90 percent of loans are under 50,000
 isse koi phaayde kii naukari kaa srijan nahin ho saktaa he
 Many people took loans that were already traded
 lone liya magar rojgaar nahin badha
 Only 1 of the money loan sanctioned
 3 pratishat lone hi 5 lakh se upar he
 This is the amount from which one can be expected to create a new job for others
 andaaza lagaaya ja rahaa he ki itnaa lone diya to itnaa rojgaar paidaa hua, lekin bade udyogpatiyon ko kai lakh karod lone die gaye, vahaan ye hisaab kyon nahin lagaaya jaataa ki inhen das lakh karod lone diya to itnaa rojgaar paidaa hua
 Does employment only arise from Mudra loans
 abhi tak teen saal main 6 lakh karod mudra lone ke tahat diya gaya he
 On 13 March 2019, Financial Express reported that 53 percent of Mudra loans have become bad loans in the first 9 months of 2018-19
 yah soochna artiai se hasil kii gai he
 14,930 from 9,769 crore in 2017-18
 98 karod ho gaya
 As on 31 December 2018, the number of NPC accounts exceeded 28 lakh
 31 march 2018 ko enpie ke acount kii sankhya kareeb 18 lakh thi
 Who was given the currency, how it was given is a different story
 ise bataane ke liye khaas tarah kii yogyata kii zarurat hoti he
 You will only know when you study their characters
 upi main teen saal main 1 karod se adhik logon ko mudra lone mila he
 1 crore is a lot

 Azeem Premji University and Lokniti CSDS have surveyed more than 24,000 people in 12 states in 2018

 In the 10th pass, 19 percent of the youth consider unemployment as the biggest issue
 18 se 35 saal ke naujavaanon main hi berojgaare sabase bada mudda he
 Among the youth above 36 years, the issue of unemployment starts to weaken
 is survey kaa ek nishkarsh yah he ki 2014 se 2018 ke bich rojgaar kaa sawaal chaar saalon main kaaphi bada ho gaya he
 In 2014, only 6 percent of the voters considered employment at the top, but in 2018 it was 19 percent
 24,000 kaa 19 pratishat 4560 hota he
 The complete survey is available on the website of Azeem Premji University
 to kya is chunaav main rojgaar kii baat ho rahi he
 The reply from the Ministry of Home Affairs is that in five years, the Modi government has not made any new system of releasing employment data
 jo puraani vyavastha thi use band kar di
 Accordingly, the National Statistical Commission of 2018 reported that unemployment is the highest in 45 years
 jin logon kaa kaam tha aankadon ko jutanaa, adhyayan karnaa or jari karnaa, unke kaam ko band kar diya gaya
 But instead the minister continued to release data at his level
 kabhi mudra lone ke aadhaar par aankada dete rahe ki itane lone jari hue to itane rojgaar paidaa hue

 sincerely) gaharaati shaam ke saath thand badhane lagi thi
 Our train arrived at the late Nizamuddin railway station for about five hours
 19 ghante ke thakaaoo safar ke baad main or meraa parivaar saamaan lekar neeche utraa
 Seeing the crowd that was on the platform, it seemed as if everyone has landed from this train to come to Delhi
 ham log dheer-dhire baahar kii ore badhane lage
 There was too much luggage, so i parked my mother and aunt near the stairs outside the station and started bringing the items one by one
 hamaare yahaan railway steshnon par saamaan lekar baahar tak aana kisi jang se kam nahin he
 i was coming out carrying the last bag in my shoulders, that a person passed by touching me very close to me
 itnaa hi nahin, uski himmat dekhie ki vah vah thodaa aage badhkar peeche muda or mujhe dekhakar muskuraane laga
 My mind woke up and within a few moments different thoughts came into my mind
 uske chehre par kamyaabi kii muskaan mere dil main chubh rahi thi
 The time was short
 main furti se aage badi or uski kalai pakadakar bheed se alag footpath par le gai or uske haath marodakar peeche se pakad liya, taaki vah bhaag na sake
 i was shocked when i gave him a loud slap
 meraa man abhi bharaa nahin tha
 i got my five fingers together and printed her face several times with full force
 pataa nahin itani takat uski muskaan se paidaa hui kuntha se mere bheetar ai thi yaa iske peeche kolkata kaa paushtik bhojan tha
 But i was still being beaten up wildly
 main use ghasitkar baahar taxi stand kii taraf le ai, taaki police vaala najar aae to uske hawaale kar sakuun
 But not a single uniform was seen there
 ab alam yun tha ki main paidal chalate hue police vaale ko dhund rahi thi or saath ke saath us shohade ko pite bhi ja rahi thi
 Sometimes with your hands, sometimes with your water bottle
 uske munh se koi maafee nahin nikali
 Rather, he kept stopping my hand while beating, and said, 'know who is killing me? i am from Jhansi
 ' ab sunanaa itnaa tha ki meraa gussa saatven aasmaan par pahunch gaya
 i caught his collar and slapped him and turned his face red

 Working women are more prone to breast cancer than other women
 purvaagrah or bhedbhaav samet kaarysthal par tanaav ke kaaran kaamkaaji mahilaon ke stan cancer kii chapet main aane kii ashanka naatakeey rup se bahut adhik bad jaati he
 One study claimed that working women were found to be 70 percent more likely to develop breast cancer than other women
 1970 ke dashak main umr ke 30wein padaav par rahi mahilaon par kai dashakon tak kiye gaye adhyayan ke baad kaarysthal ke tanaav or cancer ke bich sambandh paaya gaya
 It was also observed that the longer the women who worked, the more the risk of cancer increased
 adhyayan main aisi kareeb chaar hajaar mahilaon ko shaamil kiya gaya tha, jo 1975 main 36 kii umr main thim
 This report has been published in The Independent
 adhyayan team kii pramukh dow
 Tatyana Pudrovska said, 'women who entered the managerial profession in the 1970s had to suffer prejudice and discrimination due to the cultural attitude present in the society
 puraani roodhiyon ke anusaar us samay yahi mana jaataa tha ki mahilaon ke mukaable purush adhik behatar netaa banate hai
 He said, "neither men nor women want to work under a female boss, because women are considered unfit for the management profession by nature
 ' unhone kaha, 'mahila bos ko purvagrahon, bhedbhaav, saamaajik algaav tathaa adhinsthon, sahakarmiyon or varishton kii ore se virodh kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 'dr
 tatyanaa ne kaha, 'hamaara maananaa he ki kaamkaaji mahilaon ko aaj bhi usee prakaar ke tanaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa he or isiilie badha hua khatra aaj bhi barkaraar rahane kii ashanka he
 ' adhiktar mata-pita is baat se sahamat honge ki video game khelnaa samay kii barbaadi he or bacchon ke liye hanikaarak he, lekin ek nae adhyayan ke mutabik video game bacchon kii kalpanashiltaa ko badhaate hai
 According to a dailymail report, a study by the University of Michigan found that children who play more video games show more creativity in writing and drawing stories
 is adhyayan main 12 saal kii umr ke kareeb 500 bacchon ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Earlier studies said that games inhibit children's development and even make them more violent
 is adhyayan main in anya muddon ke bare main nahin bataaya gaya balki bacchon ke vikaas par video game ke prabhaav kaa pataa lagane ke liye rachaanaatmakataa se sambandhit maanakon kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 The study is published in the journal Computer in Human Behavior
 adhyayan main yah bhi paaya gaya ki ladke ladakiyon kii tulana main adhik video game khelte hai, lekin rachanaatmakataa par ling, khel ke prakaar yaa gati aadi kaa prabhaav nahin padataa
 Just playing more video games is related to more creativity

 in dinon khabaren aa rahi hai ki film 'dilavaale' main abhinay karne ke baad kaajol ko is film kaa hissaa banane ko lekar afsos he
 According to sources, Kajol is now regretting the performance of the film
 khabaron ke anusaar kaajol jab parade par vaapasi karne kii taiyaari kar rahi thim, tab unke paas ek samay main 2 filmon ke ofer aae the
 Among them was director Sujoy Ghosh's film Durga Rani Singh with 'dilwale'
 magar kaajol ne sujoy kii film chhodkar shahrukh ke saath film 'dilavaale' karne kaa nirnay liya, kyonki ghar, bacchon or kaam ke bich ek saath 2 filmon kaa samay nahin tha
 But now according to the news, Kajol is regretting that according to her, she had something to do in 'durga Rani Singh'
 agar vaaqai kaajol pachhataa rahi hai to ye pachhtava kyon? kyonki shahrukh ke saath unki jodi hit hoti he, yahi sochakar kaajol ne is film kaa hissaa banane kaa nirnay liya hoga
 Kajol will also be a part of 'dilwale' thinking that her comeback will be with the blockbuster film, because Shah Rukh Khan is a Bollywood superstar and part of a very big budget film
 tippaniyan Anyway, Shah Rukh needs Kajol to succeed at the box office
 Kajol may need Shah Rukh, so Kajol should be happy that his comeback was at least known to the audience
 haalanki film 'dilavaale' ne videshi box offis par acha kaarobaar kiya
 The film crossed 150 crores at the Indian box office as well, but the controversy at Shah Rukh's statement of intolerance and landing at the box office with the film 'baji Rao Mastani' did not do the business that was expected
 or to or, kaajol ko bhi koi saraahna nahin mili or shaayad yahi vajah hogi ki kaajol ko ab afsos ho rahaa he
 According to the news, when Kajol was preparing to return to the screen, she had offers of 2 films at a time
 inamen 'dilavaale' ke saath nirdeshak sujoy ghosh kii film 'durga rani singh' thi
 But Kajol decided to leave Sujoy's film and do the film 'dilwale' with Shah Rukh, as there was no time for 2 films together between home, kids and work
 magar ab khabaron ke anusaar kaajol pachhataa rahi hai kyonki unke mutabik 'durga rani singh' main unke paas kuch karne ke liye tha
 If Kajol is really regretting, then why this regret? Because his pairing with Shah Rukh is a hit, Kajol must have decided to be a part of this film
 kaajol bhi yahi sochakar 'dilavaale' kaa hissaa bani hongi ki unka kambek dhadlle se or blockbster film ke saath hoga, kyonki shahrukh khan bollywood ke superstar hai or bahut bade bajet kii film kaa hissaa bani hai
 The comments vaise bhi shahrukh ko box offis par safalataa ke liye kaajol kii nahin kaajol ko shahrukh kii zarurat ho sakati he, isliye kaajol ko khush hona chahie ki unke kambek kaa darshakon ko kam se kam pataa to chalaa
 However, the film 'dilwale' did well at the overseas box office
 indian box offis par bhi film 150 karod ke paar gai, magar shahrukh ke asahansheeltaa ke byaan par hue vivaad or film 'baaji raav mastaani' ke saath box offis par utarane kii vajah se film kaa aisa kaarobaar nahin hua, jisaki ummid thi
 Moreover, Kajol did not get any appreciation and perhaps that would be the reason why Kajol is now feeling sorry

 Every year, the fifteen days from the Krishna Paksha Pratipada to Amavasya of Ashwin month are called Pitrupaksha and this time is only guaranteed for the worship and worship of the ancestors
 kaha jaataa he ki is samay purvajon ke samaran se na keval unki aatma ko tripti milti he balki ve santusht hokar aashirwad bhi dete hai
 So do 3 visions of such a dham, where only the ancestors will be satisfied by performing shraadh and tarpan in the Pitrukshak, but will fill the house with happiness, prosperity, wealth and opulence
 gaya dhamavidic parampara or hindu manyataon ke anusaar pitaron ke liye shraddha se shraadh karnaa ek mahaan or utkrisht kaary he
 According to the belief, the life of a son is considered meaningful only when he serves the surviving parents during his lifetime and duly honors them after his death
 aswin krishna paksh pratipada se asina maheene kii amavasya tak ke samay ko pitrupaksh yaa mahalaya paksh kaha jaataa he
 According to belief, the person who dies from the pindadan attains salvation
 aise to desh main haridwar, gangasagar, kurushetra, chitrakoot, pushkar sahit kai sthanon main bhagwaan pitaron ko shraddhapurvak kiye gaye shraadh se moksh pradaan kar dete hai, lekin gaya main kiye gaye shraadh kii mahima kaa gungan to bhagwaan ram ne bhi kiya he
 It is said that Lord Rama and Mother Sita also offered pinddaan in Gaya for the peace of King Dasharatha's soul
 aacharyon ke mutabik logon main yah aam dharna he ki ek parivaar main se koi ek vyakti hi `gaya` karata he
 To perform Gaya means to worship the ancestors in the Gaya, to perform the pinddaan
 garud puraana main likhaa gaya he ki gaya jane ke liye ghar se nikalne par chalane vaale ek-ek kadam pitaron ko swarg kii ore le jane ke liye ek-ek seedhi kii tarah banate jate hai 
 Gaya is considered the city of Vishnu
 yah moksh kii bhoomi kehalaati he
 It is also discussed in Vishnu Purana and Vayu Purana
 vishnu puraana ke mutabik gaya main pindadaan karne se purvajon ko moksh mil jaataa he or unhen swarg main vaas miltaa he
 Vishnu himself is believed to exist as the ancestral deity in Gaya, hence it is also called the 'pitru Tirtha'
 puranic manyataon ke anusaar bhasmasur ke vansh main gayasur naamak rakshas ne kathin tapasya kar brahmaji se vardaan maanga tha ki uskaa sharir devataaon kii tarah pavitra ho jaae or log uske darshan maatr se paap mukt ho jaaen
 After the grant of this boon, the population of heaven began to increase and events contrary to natural law began to occur
 log bina bhay ke paap karne lage or gayasur ke darshan se paap mukt hone lage
 In order to avoid this, the gods asked for the sacred site for Yajna from gayasur
 gayasur ne apana sharir devataaon ke yajna ke liye de diya
 When Gaiasur lay, his body spread into five Kos
 yahi paanch kos kii jagah aage chalakar gaya bani parantu gayasur ke man se logon ko paap mukt karne kii ichha nahin gai or phir usne devataaon se vardaan maanga ki yah sthaan logon ko mukti dene vaala bana rahe 
 Those who pind daan here with the desire to pay someone, they will get liberation
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bhi log apane pitaron ko taarane ke liye pindadaan ke liye gaya aate hai
 Gaya is said to have previously had 360 altars of various names where Pindadan was performed
 inamen se ab 48 hi bachi hai
 However many religious institutions are demanding the discovery of those old altars
 vartmaan samay main inhen vediyon par log pitaron kaa tarpan or pindadaan karte hai
 Millions of people from India and abroad come to Gaya every year for pindadan
 pushkargaya ke baad jaane pushkar ke bare main
 Coming here to take a dip in Brahma Sarovar and offer prayers to his fathers, the life of someone who got it does not seem to be late
 jaipur se 150 kimi par basaa pushkar jahaan kadam rakhte hi man ek anokhi shanti se bhar jaataa he
 While reaching, not only the fortunes of the only temple of the Supreme Father Brahma get good luck, but the devotees get salvation by the sight of the holy Brahma Sarovar spread far and wide
 pushkar ke is brahm sarovar ke bare main kaha jaataa hai ki is sarovar main lagaai gai ek dubti janm janmaantar ke chakra se mukti de detii he or jivan main sukhri-samruddhi se bhar detii he
 After coming to Pushkar, everyone has a strong desire to visit the holy Brahma lake once and this is also the classical law of Brahma Puja, so that every devotee can see the place from where life originated
 was
 duniya bhar se log yahaan snaan karke punya kamaane hi nahin balki apane pitaron kii shanti ke liye shraadh karne bhi aate hai kyonki puranic maanyaataaon main pushkar ko mrityu lok ke sabase bade pavitra tirthon main se ek mana gaya he or yahi kaaran he ki shraadh paksh ke dauraan baari sankhya main shraddhalu brahm sarovar ke kinare apane piraton kii aatma kii shanti va moksh prapti ke liye vidhi-vidhaan se pidandan va taparn karte hai
 The virtue of coming to Pushkar and applying Jubki in Brahma Sarovar and seeing the Supreme Father Brahma is considered to be equal to the virtue of Chardham Yatra
 kehete hai agar koi vyakti chaar dham ki tirth yatra karata he to uske baad pushkar aakar brahm sarovar main dubkee lagane ke baad hi uski yatra purna maani jaati he
 The process of worshiping in Pushkar begins with the Brahma Muhurta
 brahm muhoort main bhakt nikal padate hai apane aradhy kii aradhana ke liye or aradhana kii kram shuru hota he gaoo ghat se
 In the Gau Ghat, the first morning aarti is performed, after the aarti, the milk of Brahma is performed
 dugdhabhishek ke dauraan puraa parisar mantron kii paavan dhwani kii gunj uthta he
 All the process of worship of Brahma is associated with the worship of Lord Brahma
 iske baad bhakton ke kadam badhate hai us sthaan par jahaan brahma ji kii 4 sir vaali murti virajman hai
 Only Lord Brahma is seen inside this temple
 puja karnaa mandir andar puri tarah varjit he
 After seeing Brahma ji, darshan of mother Savitri is definitely done, whose temple is situated on a hill just a short distance away
 kehete hai jab tak bhakt maa savitri ke darshan na kar len parampita brahma kii puja adhuri maani jaati he
 This holy abode of Goddess Lakshmi is built in Varanasi
 kehete hai jab pitrupaksh main jab sabhi devtaa shayan ke liye chale jate hai, tab varanasi main maa lakshmi akeli aisi devi hai jo jaagrath rahati hai or bhakton par lutaati hai apni krupa
 Here the mother sits without Narayan and opens the door of treasure for Shiva devotees
 maa lakshmi ke darbar main bhakton kii bheed umad padi he unka aashirwad paane ke liye, aarti se kiya ja rahaa he maa kaa gungan or bhakt laga rahe hai apni apni fariyaad
 Mother's form is unique, her glory is incomparable, and this is well known to the devotees who come here
 tabhi to subah ho yaa shaam bhakt daude chale aate hai or jhukaa dete hai maa ke charnon main sheesh
 In Pitrupaksha, when all the gods go to sleep, then mother Lakshmi in Varanasi is the only goddess who stays awake and lavishes her blessings on the devotees
 yahaan maa narayan ke bina virajati hai or shivbhakton ke liye khol detii hai khajaane kaa dwaar
 The mother gives as much as she needs, without saying anything
 maa kaa vardaan paane ke liye chahie hota he to sirf ek kaccha dhaagaa
 In this thread, 16 bales are offered to the mother and then 16 kinds of offerings and 16 makeup items are offered
 kehete hai aisa kar 16 din tak vrath rakhane waalon par maa jaldi prasann ho jaati hai
 There is also a lake in Varanasi right in front of the temple of Goddess Lakshmi, whose devotees touch the water and take the blessings of the mother
 lekin sabase anokhaa he yahaan kaa prasad
 After the puja, the devotees buy the mask of the mother in the form of prasad and take it home for 16 days
 manyata he ki aisa karne se sabhi manokamanaayen puri ho jaati hai
 a full crowd of devotees throngs the temple of Maa Lakshmi in Kashi for the full 16 days of Pitrupaksha
 kehete hai in 16 dinon main jisane maa ke aage mattha tech diya, use phir kahin or jane kii jarurat nahin rahati
 Those who come empty handed come back from here with a bag and become devotees of mother life

 Bihar Police is now determined to do two or two hands with Union Minister Ashwini Choubey
 ek police adhikari ko apane janata darbar main fatkaar lagane kii ashvini choube kii chaal ulti padati nazar aa rahi hai
 The Bihar Police has filed a complaint of misconduct and misdemeanor in Buxar
 isse pehle mantri ashvini choube ne somvaar ko bhaajapa ke ek kaaryakarta lakshmana dube dwaara kii gai shikaayat par opi prabharee rajeev ranjan ko bulaakar aag babula ho gayi
 Not only this, he had also threatened to take off the uniform and spoil the future
 lakshmana dube ne bataaya tha ki unka naam gunda register main darj kiya gaya hai or mantri se madad maangi thi
 a video of this also went viral
 darasal mantri bhaajapa ke jis kaaryakarta kii tarafadaari kar rahe hai uskaa naam pehle se gunda register main darj hai
 They are also charged in a case

 'india will read only then India will move forward' 


 This slogan is given that no child of the country should be deprived of school education
 garib se garib parivaar kaa baccha bhi skool ja sake, iske liye centre sarkaar or rajya sarkaron kii taraf se kai yojanaayen chalaai ja rahi hai
 In this direction, a provision was made under the 'right to Education Act 2009' by the Government of Madhya Pradesh that if private schools admit children from disadvantaged classes, their fees will be paid by the government
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne isi mad main beete chah saal main privet skulon ko kareeb 600 karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiya
 But it is a shame that a large part of this money was not spent on the education of poor children, but in the pocket of alliances of private schools and education mafia
 india today network kii jaanch se khulaasa hua he ki kis tarah in jaalsaajon ne garib bacchon ke haq par daaka daalaa or shiksha ke pavitra peshey ko daagdar kiyaap jaanakar hairaan honge ki paisa hadapney ke is khel main 64-64 varshiya bujurgon ko bhi nursery or pehali-duusari kakshaon kaa chaatr dikhaa diya gaya
 In order to defraud the government treasury by private schools, a fake list of students who have never seen the face of the school was prepared
 2011 se badastoor chal rahe is gorakhdhandhe kii jade puure madhya pradesh main faili hui dikhin
 An investigation by the India Today Network found that a list of 241 students was handed over by the Jagat Janani Vidya Mandir School in Jabalpur to the government to pay fees for underprivileged children in 2015-16
 is suchi ko madhya pradesh sarkaar ke shiksha portal samgr par aplod bhi kiya gaya
 The name of the students along with their overall ID (identity) is also given in the list
 jab samgr portal par idi ke aadhaar par jaanch kii gai to paaya gaya ki suchi main ek bhi chaatr bhi aisa nahin tha jisaki skool kii ore se asli idi uplabdh karai gai ho
 For example, Sumit Ahirwar, a student of class 2 of this school, has an ID next to the name -193448019
 jab hamane is idi ko samgr portal par check kiya to ye asal main deepak kumaar sonkar kii nikali jiskaa janm 1990 main hua tha
 Moreover, the list of 180 students given by Jagat Janani School for 2014-15, their ID also turned out to be completely fake
 is suchi main bhi deepak kumaar sonkar kii idi ko kaksha keji1 ke chaatr surabhit ahirwar ke naam ke aage dikhaaya gaya
 When the team of India Today Network ascertained the true identity of Deepak Kumar Sonkar on the basis of the overall portal address, he found that he lived by selling vegetables on the cart
 sonkar se is vishay par baat kii gai to unhone kaha, “main nahin jaanata tha ki meri idi kaa is tarah istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 i sell vegetables and all i can say is that strict action should be taken against the school who stole my ID and misused it
 ”jabalpur main jagat janani akelaa skool nahin he jo vanchit garib bacchon ke haq par farji suchi dekar daaka maar rahaa he
 In this context, when the lists given by Osmania Middle School, Osmania Children's School, Smita Children's Academy, Adarsh gyan Sagar Vidyalaya, Guru Public School and St
 Abraham Nursery School were also examined, it was found that all these schools were also in the Government of Madhya Pradesh
 Were giving money by giving fake lists in the name of education of poor children
 ye ghotaalaa sirfjabalpur tak hisimit nahin he
 Madhya Pradesh has about 40,000 private schools in 51 districts
 inhen das prashasnic divijan main baanta gaya he
 India Today Network randomly selected schools in every division and investigated them, and the cannabis of corruption was found in the entire well itself
 bhopal divijan main bhopal, raisen, rajgad, sihor, vidisha jile aate hai
 After checking the list given by Vivekananda Education Institute of Mandideep in Raisen district, it was found that 64-year-old Chand Mian was shown as Palak Mandore, a nursery student here
 chand mia ko dhund nikaala to khulaasa hua ki chand miyaan kii 62 varshiya patni, 30 varshiya putravadhu or 5 varshiya pote kii idi kaa bhi uparokt skool kii ore se durupyog kiya ja rahaa he
 Chand Mian said, "my grandchildren have been studying in this school but we paid their full fees
 daakhile ke vakt unhone samgr idi kii maang kii thi tathaa bataaya tha ki fees maaf ho jaaegi
