 Similarly, the deductive method also has its weaknesses in that it is limited by the total number of basic common bases and the inability to prove the truth of those bases
 sangyaan kii vaastavik prakriya main aagaman or nigaman kii ekta hoti he
 This unity makes it possible to use the benefits of both these methods, thereby eliminating the effect of one flaw on the other
 aagaman, nigaman se anivarytah sampoorit hota he or usamen nigaman ke tatv shaamil hote hai
 It is not limited to accurately representing the same characteristics in the objects under consideration, but distinguishes the basic elements from them and reveals their mutual combinations and relationships, which is impossible without some elements of incorporation

 In arranging the study material, it can be introduced in an inductive way and also in a deductive manner

 Almost all problems can be presented in both inductive and deductive ways

 a well-known, easily understood method of presenting the problem is available with the aid of arrival, while accurate proof of the propositions offered require incorporation

 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society

 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible

 The modern system of firing in the new gun was used, but the process of firing in the gun was old
 nayi enfield bandook bharne ke liye kaartoos ko daanton se kaat kar kholana padataa tha or usame bhare hue barud ko bandook kii nalee main bhar kar kaartoos ko daalana padataa tha
 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai
 The then British Army Chief George Enson, bypassing the advice of his officers, solved the problem arising out of this exercise and new gun
