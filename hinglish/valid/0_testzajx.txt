 Lohri is a famous festival in North India
 yah makar sakranti ke ek din pehle manaaya jaataa he
 The festival is celebrated on the eve of Makar Sankranti
 raatri main khule sthaan main parivaar or aas-pados ke log milakar aag ke kinare gheraa bana kar baithte hai
 At this time, Revdi, groundnut, lava etc

 The ritual of Shvaturya was performed on Makar Sankranti, probably Lohri is a relic of that
 pus-magh kii kadakadaati sardi se bachane ke liye aag bhi sahaayak siddh hoti he-yahi vyaavhaarik aavashyaktaa 'lohadi' ko mausami parv kaa sthaan detii he
 It is known from the traditions and customs related to Lohri that prehistoric stories have also been associated with it
 daksh prajapati kii putree sati ke yogagni-dahan kii yaad main hi yah agni jalaai jaati he
 On this occasion, married daughters are sent to 'festival' from the mother's house

 Dealing with the work of home and business, each family revolves around fire
 revadi agni kii bhent kiye jate hai tathaa ye hi chijen prasad ke rup main sabhi upasthit logon ko baanti jaati hai
 There is also a practice of bringing two to four burning flame of coal, in the form of prasad, at home while returning home

 On the day of Lohri or two to four days before, the girls ask for money of 'mohammaya' or Mahamai from the shopkeepers and pilgrims in the market, buying wood and revdis from them and use them in collective Lohri
 shaharon ke shararti ladke duusare muhallon main jaakar 'lohadi' se jalati hui lakdi uthaakar apane muhalle kii lohadi main daal dete hai
 This is called 'lohri Vyahna'

 All the songs of Lohri are connected to Dulla Bhatti and it can also be said that Dulla Bhatti is made the centerpiece of Lohri songs
 dulla bhatti mogul shaasha akbar ke samay main punjab main rahata tha
 He was awarded the title of Nayak of Punjab! At that time, the girls were forcefully sold to slaves in place of Sandal Bar, which Dulla Bhatti did not only free the girls under a scheme but got their marriage done to Hindu boys and all the arrangements for their marriage too
 Got it done

 His ancestors were the rulers of the Pindi furnaces that used to be in the Sandal Bar, now the Sandal Bar is located in Pakistan

 In the same way Daguru's ideas produced great warriors like Ala Udal, Raja Gopichand

 Like Jaimal Fantiha, the commander of Maharana Pratap and Sir Senapati of Raja Ratansing and Gor Banjara Gaura Badal, brother of Rani Rupmati

 Now that village is known as Sevagad

 Bhima Nayaka, the son of Seva Lal's father Ramji Nayak, was a very big businessman
 unhen lagbhag bhartiya sabhi bhashaaon kaa gyaan tha
 Their total wealth consisted of 4000 to 5000 cows and bullocks
 jiskaa upyog anaaj kii yatayaat ke liye kiya jaataa tha or wo 52 taandon ke ke nayak the
 He was called Naikada
 a village had a population of around 500
 har tande ke liye ek purush or ek stri gore dharm prachaarak ke rup main kaam karte the, unhen baavann bheru or 64 joganni kehete the
 There used to be a union of these 52 Bheru and 64 Jogani
 or ye mukhya nayakda ke antargat kaayam karte the
 That is why Saint Seva Lal's grandfather was called Ramshagh Nayak
 bhima nayak bhi 52 taandon ke sanghapramukh the
 Historical documents have shown that Bhima Nayak with the British cost 2 lakh rupees
 Had a merchant agreement
 is baat se saaf pataa chalaata he kii, sevaalaal kaa janm vaibhav sapann ghar main hua tha
 Apart from this, a lot of false stories are heard about his birth
 sevaalaal kii maan kaa naam dharamni tha jo ki jairam badtiya kii suputree thi
 After the marriage of Bhima Nayak, he had no child for almost 12 years, later Saint Sevlal was born after the worship of Mother Mother
 sangh ke paramparik niti ke nusaar swaraksha or anaaj kii raksha ke liye yauddhaon kii nirmiti kii jaati thi
 Keeping the same in mind, Sevlal formed a confederation of 7 Sanghatanaikas in which Sevlal himself, his three brothers, Hapa Badu, Pura and Dharmi, Dhaka, Ramsang were also together
 isi sanghatan ko baad main 6 sangh nayakon ne apanaaya
 In this way a federation of 13 people was formed? Which led to 700 Tando comprising of Madhyabharata, Dakshin Bharat
 madhyabhaarat ke vyapaaree bhagavaandaras vadtiya kulsampatti 2 lakh bail) or dakshibharat ke vyapaaree jangi, bhangi bhukiya sevaalaal ke sangh main samavisht hue
 According to the state position of the 17th century, we can say that, the influence and power of the British power was increasing day by day and the system of Indian kings was getting weaker
 angreji hukumat kaa gore banjaaraa vyapaaree par raajaaon ko rasad pahunchane ke khilaaf dabaav badhate ja rahaa tha
 And the British tax-affected Gor Banjara merchants were being charged with tax collection which was against the merchant rules of Gor Banjara
 is kar vasuli ke khilaaf prastaav lekar sevaalaal apane sabhi sangh nayakon ke saath nizaam se milane gayi
 Fearing the British rule, the Nizam turned down the proposal, in view of this Sevlal declared war against the Nizam
 phir hyderabad main yuddh hua or parinamswarup nizaam ne sevaalaal kii sabhi sharte manjur kii or bharat ke anya rajyon ke karpranali ke liye dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ko milane kii salaah di
 Sevlal accepted the Nizam's advice and accepted the honor given by the Nizam
 sammaan ke taur par nizaam ne tamrapatr, talwaar or bhetwastu di
 These Bhetavastuans still exist in the Pohragadh temple
 dilli ke badshaah gulam khan ne is prastaav ko naamanjur kiya, parinaam swarup sevaalaal ne yuddh kaa elaan kiya, gulam khan ke 25000 sainikon kaa muqabla sevaalaal ke 900 yauddhaon ne kiya
 Historians never mentioned this war, Ghulam Khan lost heavily
 gulam khan ne karpranali ko maaf karne ko manjur kiya
 This was a huge political victory for Sevlal from a business point of view
 is jeet ke chalate sevaalaal kaa naam puure bharat varsh main prasiddh hua
 Gaurbanjara of Lahore honored Sevlal
 jaipur ke banjaaraa vyapaaree or bahujan logon kii pukaar par sevaalaal ne bhumia naamak dahshatagrast kaa shirched kiya or rajasthanvaasiyon ko bhumia se mukti dilaai
 Even today, this is a sign of Sevlal's Mandir at Sawai Mansing Hospital in Jaipur
 dilhisthit rysina hill lakishon banjaaraa ne sevaalaal ke swaagat main banaai hui chhatri nehru planitorium, nai dilli main maujuud he
 Similarly, there is still Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust in Sevanamak village near Mumbai, where Sevalal Port used to be in the 17th century
 vaise hi dharmtar naam kaa port raigarh jilhe main pen ke paas maujud he
 Similarly, not even Bhaucha in Mumbai is Sevabhaya's push
 is jagah par portuguese kaa jahaaj fas gaya tha use sevaalaal ne nikaala, falswarup unhen motiyon kii maala diya gaya, isi vajah se sevaalaal motivalo ke naam se bhi jane jate hai
 Sevlal had a merchant center in the village named Gagode near Paan in Rayagada district where the Mandir of his name still exists
 sevaalaal bahut bade vyapaaree, yauddha, sangatak, arthtajna to the hi lekin uske saath ve bahut bade samajasudharak the
 The strength and wisdom of Sevlal can be ascertained from the fact that the prophecies that Sevlal had about the social and economic and natural state of India are coming true after 250 years

 vrikk yaa gurde kaa joda ek maanav ang hai, jinka pradhan kaary mutr utpaadan karnaa he
 The kidneys are found in many vertebrate animals
 ye mutr-pranali ke ang hai
 They regulate the electrolyte, alkali-acid balance and blood pressure
 inkaa mel swarup mutr kehalaata he
 It mainly consists of urea and ammonia
 gurde yugmit ang hote hai, jo kai kaary karte hai
 They are found in many types of animals, including vertebrates and some invertebrates
 ye hamaari mutr-pranali kaa ek aavashyak bhaag hai or ye electrolite niyantran, amla-kshar santulan, va raktchaap niyantran aadi jaise samasthiti kaary bhi karte he
 These act as natural purifiers of blood in the body and remove waste, which is then sent to the bladder
 mutr kaa utpaadan karte samay, gurde uria or ammonium jaise apshisht padaarth utsarjit karte hai; gurde jal, glucose or amino amlon ke punarvasoshana ke liye bhi zimmedaar hote hai
 The kidneys also produce hormones, including calcitriol, renin, and erythropoietin
 audrik guha ke pichley bhaag main retroperitonium The kidneys located in the vesicles receive blood from a pair of renal arteries and flow it into a pair of renal veins
 prayek gurda mutr ko ek mutrvahini main utsarjit karata he, jo ki swayan bhi mutrashay main rikt hone vaali ek yugmit sanrachana hoti he
 The study of kidney function is called renal physiology, while the medical method related to kidney diseases is called Meghalogy
 gurde kii bimaariyaan vividh prakaar kii hai, lekin gurde se judi bimariyon ke rogiyon main aksar vishisht chikitsiya lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 Common medical conditions associated with the kidney include nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute renal lesions, chronic kidney diseases, urethral infections, renal calculi and ureteric obstruction
 gurde ke cancer ke anek prakaar bhi maujuud hai; sabase aam vayask vrikk cancer vrikk koshika karkat he
 Cancer, cyst and some other kidney conditions can be managed by removal of the kidney, or by renal dissection
 jab gurde kaa kaary, jise kechikagucchheey shuddhikaran dar ke dwaara napa jaataa he, lagaataar buree ho, to dyalisis or gurde kaa pratyaropan iske upachaar ke vikalp ho sakate hai
 Although stones are not very harmful, they can also cause pain and problems
 pathari ko hataane kii prakriya main dhwani tarangon dwaara upachaar shaamil he, jisase pathar ko chote tukdon main todakar mutrashay ke raste baahar nikaal diya jaataa he
 Intense pain in the medial / lateral segments of the back of the back is a common symptom of appendicitis
 manushyon main, gurde udar guha main retroperitonium naamak rikt sthaan main sthit hote hai
 Their number is two and one of these kidneys is located one on either side of the spinal cord; They are approximately at the vertebral level from T12 to L3
 daayan gurda madhyapat ke thik neeche or yakrut ke peeche sthit hota he, tathaa baayan madhyapat ke neeche or pleeha ke peeche hota he
 There is an adrenal gland at the top of each kidney
 yakrut ke kaaran udar guha main pai jane vaali vishmata ke kaaran daayan gurda baayen kii tulana main thodaa neeche hota he or baayan gurda daaen kii tulana main thodaa adhik madhyam main sthit hota he
 The upper part of the kidney is partially protected by the eleventh and twelfth ribs and the entire kidney and adrenal glands are covered by fat and renal bandage
 prayek vayask gurde kaa bhaar purushon main 125 se 170 gram ke bich or mahilaon main 115 se 155 gram ke bich hota he
 Typically, the left kidney is slightly larger than the right
 gurde kii sanrachana saim ke aakaar kii hoti he, prayek gurde main avatal or uttal satahen pai jaati hai
 The concave surface, called the renal nucleus, is the point from which the renal artery enters this organ and the renal vein and ureter exit
 gurda sakht reshedaar utakon, vrikkeey capsule se ghira hota he, jo swayan perinephric vasa, vrikk pattee tathaa paranefric vasa se ghiri hoti he
 The anterior border of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior border is the transversalis bandage

 Therefore, both of these go down when breathing
 gurda lagbhag 11-14 semi lanbaa, 6 semi chaudaa or 3 semi motaa hota he
 The substance of the kidney, or organism, is divided into two main structures: the renal bark in the upper part and the renal medulla within it
 kul milakar ye sanrachanaayen shanku ke aakaar ke aath se atharah vrikkeey khandon kii ek akruti banaati hai, jinamein se prayek main majja ke ek bhaag ko dhankane vaali vrikk chaal hoti he, jise vrikkeey pyramid kaha jaataa he
 Between the renal pyramids are bark ridges, called renal columns
 nefron, gurde kii mutr utpann karne vaali kaaryaatmak sanrachanaayen, chaal se lekar majja tak faili hoti hai
 The initial purification part of a nephron is the renal corpuscle located in the bark, followed by a renal tubule known deep into the medullary pyramids through the bark
 ek majjatmak kiran, vrikkeey chaal kaa ek bhaag, vrikkeey nalikaaon kaa ek samooh hota he, jo ek ekal sangrahan nalika main jaakar rikt hoti hai
 The end of each pyramid, or sprout, carries urine into the miniature follicle, the miniature follicle empties into the main follicles, and the main follicle empties into the renal pelvis, which becomes the urinaloid
 gurde baayin tathaa dahini vrikk dhamniyon se rakt praapt karte hai, jo sidhe audrik mahadhamani se nikalati hai
 Despite their relatively small size the kidneys receive about 20% of the blood released from the heart
 prayek vrikkeey dhamni anek khandaatmak dhamniyon main vibhajit ho jaati he, jo aage antarkhandtmak dhamniyon main bant jaati hai, jo vrikkeey capsule kaa chhedan karti hai or vrikkeey pyramidon ke bich sthit vrikkeey stambhon se hokar guzarati hai
 Subcutaneous arteries then supply blood to the arterial arteries, which are at the border of the bark and medulla
 prayek chapakar dhamni vibhinn antarkhandtmak dhamniyaan pradaan karti he, jo abhivahi dhamniyon ko bharti hai, jo glomeruli ko rakt kii aapurti karti hai
 Interstitum) is the functional space in the kidney, which is located under single fibers, which are filled with blood vessels
 interstitom mutr se punarprapt hue drav ko avashoshit kar letaa he
 Many conditions can cause scarring or blood clotting in this area, which can result in obstruction of kidney function and may even stop functioning
 shodhan kii prakriya purna ho jane par rakt shirikaon ke ek chote network se hokar guzarataa he, jo antarkhandtmak shiraaon kii ore abhisaran karti hai
 The veins also follow the same arterial distribution pattern, the afferent veins deliver blood to the umbilical veins, and from there it leads to the interdigital veins, which form the renal veins that exit the kidney for blood transfusions
 vrikkeey utak-vigyaan main gurde kii ek sookshmdarshi ke dwaara dikhaai dene vaali sanrachana kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Several distinct cell-types are found in the kidney, including the following: gurda or snaayu tantra vrikkeey jaal ke madhyam se aapas main samvaad karte hai, jiske reshe gurde tak pahunchane ke liye vrikkeey dhamniyon ke saath jude hote hai
 Input from the sympathetic nervous system induces vasoconstrictors in the kidney, causing renal blood flow to decrease
 aisa mana jaataa he ki gurde sahanukampi snaayu tantra se input praapt nahin karte
 gurde se nikalne vaale samvedak input merudand ke T10-11 staron kii ore badhata he or sambandhit antartvacha dwaara mahasoos kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the pain felt in the armpits may be related to the kidneys
 amla-kshar santulan, electrolite sandrata, koshiketar drav maatra ko niyantrit karke or raktchaap par niyantran rakhte hue gurde puure sharir ke homeostasis main bhaag lete hai
 The kidneys perform these homeostatic functions both independently and in association with other organs, particularly the organs of the endocrine system
 in antahsravi kaaryon kii purti ke liye vibhinn antahsravi hormone ke bich talmail kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jinamein renin, angiotensis II, eldosterone, antidiauratic hormone or artial natriuratic peptid aadi shaamil hai
 Many of the functions of the kidney are accomplished by relatively simple mechanisms of refining, reabsorption and secretion that occur in the nephron
 parishodhan, jo ki vrikkeey kanika main hota he, ek prakriya he jiske dwaara koshikaayen tathaa bade protein rakt se chaane jate hai or ek ultraphiltret kaa nirmaan hota he, jo antat mutr banegaa
 gurde ek din main 180 litre ultraphiltret utpann karte hai, jiskaa ek bahut bada pratishat punarvashoshit kar liya jaataa he or mutr kii lagbhag 2 litre maatra kii utpann hoti he
 The transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate into the blood is called reabsorption
 srav isaki vipareet prakriya he, jisamen anu vipareet disha main, rakt se mutr kii ore bheje jate hai
 Car waste materials emit
 inamen protein apachay se utpann nitrogen-yukt apshisht uria or neucleic amla ke chayapachay se utpann urik amla shaamil hai
 Any significant increase or fall in plasma osmolarity is identified by the hypothalamus, which communicates directly with the posterior mucous gland
 parasaraniyata main vruddhi hone par yah granthi antidiauratic hormone adiech kaa srav karti he, jiske parinamswaroop gurde dwaara jal kaa punarvasoshana kiya jaataa he or mutr kii sandrata bad jaati he
 These two factors work together to bring plasma osmolality back to normal levels
 adiech sangrahan nalika main sthit mukhya koshikaon se judaa hota he, jo equaporin ko majja main sthanantarit karata he, taaki jal saamanytah abhedya majja ko chhod sake or vaasa riekta dwaara sharir main iskaa punarvasoshana kiya ja sake, jisase sharir main plasma kii maatra main vruddhi hoti he
 There are two systems that create hyperpolar marrow and thus increase the amount of plasma in the body: urea recycling and 'single effect'
 uria saamanytah gurdon se ek apshisht padaarth ke rup main utsarjit kiya jaataa he
 However, when plasma blood volume is low and ADH is released, exposed aquaporins are also susceptible to urea
 isse uria ko ek hyper sangrahan nalika ko chhodkar majja main pravesh karke jal ko ‘aakarshith’ karne vaale ek hyperosmctic vilyan kaa nirmaan karne kaa mauka miltaa he
 Urea can then re-enter the nephron and be re-excreted or recycled depending on whether ADH is still present
 ‘ekal prabhaav’ is tathy kaa varnan karata he ki lups of henley kaa motaa arohi ang jal ke dwaara bhedya nahin he, lekin bhu
ni ke dwaara bhedya he
 This means that a counter-flow system is created, through which the medulla becomes more concentrated and if the collecting duct is opened by the ADH, it must be followed by a osmolarity ratio of water
 lambii-avadhi main raktchaap kaa niyantran mukhyatah gurde par nirbhar hota he
 This is mainly through the maintenance of extracellular fluid subdivision, whose size depends on the plasma sodium concentration
 haalanki, gurde sidhe hi raktchaap kaa anumaan nahin laga sakate, lekin nefron ke duurastha bhaagon main sodium or chloride kii supurdagee main parivartan gurde dwaara kiye jane vaale kinvak renin ke srav ko parivartit kar detaa he
 When the extracellular fluid subdivision is expanded and blood pressure is high, the delivery of these ions increases and the secretion of renin decreases
 isi prakaar, jab koshiketar drav upkhand sankuchit ho or raktchaap nimna ho, to sodium or chloride kii supurdagee kam ho jaati he or pratikriyaswaroop renin srav bad jaataa he
 Renin is the first member of a series of chemical messengers that together form the renin – angiotensin mechanism
 renin main hone vaale parivartan antat is tantra ke output, mukhya rup se angiotencin II or eldosteron, ko parivartit karte hai
 Each hormone acts through multiple mechanisms, but both increase the absorption of sodium chloride by the kidneys, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid subdivision and raising blood pressure
 jab renin ke str bade hue hote hai, to angiotencin II or eldosteron kii sandrata bad jaati he, jiske parinamswaroop sodium chloride ke punarvasoshana main vruddhi hoti he, koshiketar drav upkhand kaa vistaar hota he or raktchaap bad jaataa he
 Conversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II and aldosterone levels decrease, causing contraction of the extracellular fluid subdivision and decreasing blood pressure
 gurde anek prakaar ke hormone kaa srav karte hai, jinamein arethropitin, calcetriol or renin shaamil hai
 Erythropoietin is released as a response to hypoxia in the renal flow
 yah asthi-majja main arethropoasis ko utprerit karata he
 Calcitriol, the catalytic form of vitamin D, encourages intestinal absorption of calcium and renal reabsorption of phosphate
 renin, jo ki renin-angiotencin-eldosteron tantra kaa ek bhaag he, eldosteron staron ke niyantran main shaamil ek enzim hota he
 In mammals, the kidney develops from the intermediate mesoderm
 gurde kaa vikaas, jise nefrogenesis bhi kaha jaataa he, teen kramik charnon se hokar guzarataa he, jinamein se prayek ko gurde ke ek adhik unnat jode ke vikaas dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he: pronfros, mesonefros or metanefros 
 The kidneys of various animals show evidence of developmental adaptation and have long been studied in ecology and comparative physiology
 gurde kaa akruti vigyaan, jise aksar majjatmak motaai ke rup main soochibaddh kiya jaataa he, stanpayi jeevon kii prajatiyon main prakritik awaas ke sookhepan se sambandhit hota he
 Medical glossaries associated with the kidney usually use words such as renal and nephro-prefixes
 visheshan vrikkeey, jiskaa arth hota he, vrikk se sambandhit, latin shabd reness se liya gaya he, jiskaa arth he gurde; upsarg nefro- gurde ke liye prayukt pracheen greek shabd nefros ) se liya gaya he
 For example, removal of the kidney by surgery is called nephrectomy, whereas renal dysfunction is called renal dysfunction
 saamanytah, manushya keval ek gurde ke saath bhi saamaanya rup se jivit rah sakate hai kyonki prayek main vrikkeey utakon kii sankhya jivit rahane ke liye aavashyak sankhya se adhik hoti he
 Long-term kidney diseases will develop only when the amount of functional kidney tissue decreases too much
 Renal replacement treatment, in the form of dialysis or renal transplantation, is required when the glomerular purification rate is greatly reduced or when the symptoms of renal dysfunction are very severe
 adhikansh kasheruki jeevon main, mesonefros ek vayask gurde main parivartit ho jaataa he, haalanki aksar yah adhik unnat metanefros ke saath judaa hua hota he; keval amniot main mesonefros bhrun tak simit hota he
 The kidneys of fish and amphibians are typically narrow, long limbs that surround a large part of the torso
 nefron ke prayek jhund kii sangrahan nalikaayen ek archinephric nalika main jaakar rikt hoti he, jo ki amniot jeevon ke vaas defrence sadrush he
 However, this situation is not always simple; In cartilage fishes and in some amphibians, there is a small tube similar to the ureter found in amniote organisms, which empties the posterior parts of the kidney and joins the archinephric duct on the bladder or sluice
 vastutah, anek vayask upasthissom machhliyon main, gurde kaa agr bhaag vikrut ho saktaa he yaa puri tarah kaary karnaa band kar saktaa he
 In most primitive vertebrate organisms, hagfish and lampreys, the kidney structure is exceptionally simple: it consists of a line of nephrons, each of which is directly vacillated in the archinephric duct
 aksheruki jeevon main aise utsarjan ang ho sakate hai, jinka ullekh kabhi-kabhi “gurdon” ke rup main kiya jaataa he, lekin, yahaan tak ki emphioxs main bhi, ye kabhi bhi kasheruki jeevon ke gurdon ke sadrush nahin hote or zyada sahi rup se unke liye anya naamon, jaise nefredia kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The kidneys of reptiles are made up of several segments, which are roughly arranged in a linear pattern
 prayek khand ke centre main mutrvahini kii ek ekal shakha hoti he, jisamen sangrahan vahini aakar rikt hoti he
 Reptiles have relatively fewer nephrons than other amniote organisms of the same size, presumably because they have lower metabolic rates
 pakshiyon main apekshaakrit bade, lambey gurde hote hai, jinamein se prayek teen yaa adhik pruthak khandon main vibhajit hota he
 These segments are composed of several small, irregularly arranged segments, each of which is centered on a branch of the ureter
 pakshiyon ke glomeruli kaa aakaar chota hota he, lekin unamem nefron kii sankhya stanpayi jeevon kii tulana main lagbhag doguni hoti he
 The human kidney is a very specific example of mammal organisms
 anya kasheruki jeevon kii tulana main stanpayi gurde ke vishisht lakshanon main, vrikkeey pedu or vrikkeey pyramid kii upasthiti or ek spasht rup se pahachaane ja sakane vaali chaal or majja kii upasthiti shaamil hai
 The major symptom is due to the presence of a large size of the loop of Henle; They are much smaller in birds and are not found in other vertebrates
 Only in mammals, the kidney is in its traditional "kidney" shape, although there are some exceptions, such as the multi-tubular reniculate kidneys of the members of the Timberg
 latin shabd reness angrezi bhashaa ke shabd “reens ” se sambandhit he, jo ki shakespeare kaal kii angrezi, jo vah kaal bhi he, jisamen king james varjan kaa anuwaad hua tha, kii angrezi ) main gurde kaa samanaarthi shabd he
 Once upon a time, the kidneys were considered a popular place of conscience and contemplation, and many lines of the Bible are 7: 9, Rev
 2:23) says that God searches for and inspects the kidneys or "kidney" of humans
 isi prakaar, tolmud kahata he ki do main se ek gurda is baat kii salaah detaa he ki kya acha he or doosraa bataata he ki kya bura he
 The kidneys of animals can be cooked and eaten by humans
 gurdon ko saamanytah bhunaa yaa tala jaataa he, lekin bahut jatil khaadya-padaarthon main unhen ek saalan, jo inke swaad ko badhayega, ke saath dhimi aanch par pakaaya jaataa he
 In many substances, such as a mixed grill or Murav Yerushalmi, the kidneys are mixed with pieces of meat or liver

 Jaisingh Siddharaj, son of Karna Karna and Mayanalladevi of Gujarat was in many ways the best emperor of that dynasty

 He was born in 1094 AD
 pita kii mrityu ke samay vah alpavayask tha atev uski mata mayanalladevi ne kai varshon tak abhibhavika ke rup main shashan kiya tha
 After becoming an adult and taking over the reigns, Jai Singh turned his attention to the conquest of the neighboring states
 anek yudhon ke ananthar hi vah saurashtra ke aabhir shaasha navaghan athwa khangaar ko parajeet kar sakaa
 For the rule of the conquered region, he appointed an officer named Sajjan as the governor, but perhaps Jaisingh's authority could not be sustained
 jaisingh ne chalukyon ke puraane shatru nadol ke chaahmaan vansh ke aashaaraj ko adheenta sweekaar karne or samant ke rup main shashan karne ke liye baadhya kiya
 He also invaded the Chahamana kingdom of Shakambari in the north and took over his capital
 kintu ek kushalanitijna ke samaan usne apane paksh ko shaktishaalee banane ke liye apni putree kaa vivaah chaahmaan naresh arnoraaj ke saath kar diya or arnoraaj ko samant ke rup main shashan karne diya

 The captive Yashovarman had to stay in prison for some time
 is vijay ke upalaksh main jaisingh ne avantinath kaa virud dhaaran kiya or anvatimandal ke shashan ke liye mahadev ko niyukt kiya
 But in the last years of Jai Singh's reign, Yashovarman's son Jayavarman had liberated some part of Malwa state
 jaisingh ne bhinmaal ke parmarvansheey someshwar ko apane rajya ke kuch bhaag ko swatantra kar liya tha
 Jaisingh helped Bhinmal's Paramara dynasty Someswar regain his kingdom and possibly invaded East Punjab with him

 Possibly apprehensive of Madanavarman's successes in Malava, he formed friendly relations with Kalchuri and Gahadwalas of Tripuri

 Jaisingh has also been credited with the victory over Sindhuraj, who must have been a local Muslim feudal of Sindh
 jaisingh ne barbarak ko bhi parajeet kiya jo sambhavat: gujarat main rahanevaali kisi anarya jati kaa vyakti tha or siddhpur ke saadhuon ko traas detaa tha
 As a result of his victories, Jai Singh expanded the boundaries of the Chalukya empire, which was not possible in the time of any other ruler of that dynasty
 uttar main uskaa adhikaar jodhpur or jaipur tak tathaa pashchim main bhilsa tak failaa hua tha
 Kathiawar and Kutch were also included in his kingdom

 For this reason the last years of his life were sad

 But Kshemraj was not the son of Auras, so Jai Singh made Bahad, the son of his minister Udayan, his adopted son

 Jai Singh made Gujarat a center of education and literature by promoting poets and scholars

 The Siderian kalpa was a kalpa in the geological history of the earth, which began 250 million years ago and ended 230 million years ago
 yah purapragjivi mahakalp or pragjivi eon donon kaa sabase pehla kalp tha
 This was followed by the Russian era

 The sedimentary rock called the striped ironstone formation in the Siderian kalpa was at its peak
 us samay prithvi ke sagaron kaa rang haraa tha kyonki unamem badi maatra main lohe yogic ghule hue the
 Algae spread in these seas produced oxygen, which formed magnetite from this iron
 dhire-dhire sagaron kaa rang saafe hone laga
 When much of the iron was removed from the ocean, there was nothing left to absorb this oxygen, which led to an increase in the amount of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere - where methane gas had played a large role so far
 prithvi par tab tak kramviksit hue adhikansh jeev kam-oxigen vaali vaayu main panpane vaale avikalpi avayujeev the or unamem se adhikansh is badhati oxigen sandrata ko na jhel paane ke kaaran vilupt ho gaye

 kavy, kavita yaa padya, sahitya kii vah vidha he jisamen kisi kahani yaa manobhaav ko kalatmak rup se kisi bhashaa ke dwaara abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 The history of poetry and the philosophy of poetry in India is very old
 iskaa prarambh bharatmuni se samajha ja saktaa he
 Poetry literally means poetic composition or poet's work, which is duly tied in chains of verses
 kavy vah vaakya rachana he jisase chitt kisi ras yaa manoveg se purna ho
 That is, in which imagination and emotions are effected by the chosen words
 rasgangadhar main 'romantic' arth ke pratipadak shabd ko 'kavy' kaha he
 People also accept this symptom by understanding the elegance of the word under 'elegance of meaning'
 par 'arth' kii 'romaniyata' kai prakaar kii ho sakati he
 This symptom is not very clear from it
 sahitya darpanaakar vishwanath kaa lakshan hi sabase thik janchataa he
 According to him, 'the sentence is poetic'

 These three are also called Uttam, Madhyam and Adham respectively
 kavyprakashkar kaa jor chhipe hue bhav par adhik jaan padataa he, ras ke udrek par nahin

 mahakavy sargabaddh or uskaa nayak koi devtaa, raja yaa dhirodatt gunn sampann kshatriya hona chahie
 It should have any rasa pradhan from the adorned, heroic or quiet juices
 bich bich main karunaa; hasya ityadi or ras tathaa or or logon ke prasang bhi aane chahie
 There should be at least eight cantos
 mahakavy main sandhya, surya, chandra, raatri, prabhaat, mrugaya, parvat, van, ritu, sagar, sanyog, vipralambh, muni, poor, yajna, ranprayan, vivaah aadi kaa yathasthaan sannivesh hona chahie
 Poetry is considered to be of two types, visual and audio
 drishy kavy vah he jo abhinay dwaara dikhalaayaa jaay, jaise, naatak, prahasan, aadi jo padhane or sunen yogya ho, vah shravy he
 There are two types of audio poetry, prose and poetry
 padya kavy ke mahakavy or khandakavy do bhed kahe ja chuke hai
 There are also two distinctions of prose poetry - Katha and Akhyayika
 champu, virud or karambhk teen prakaar ke kavy or maane gaye he
 Generally, there are two distinctions of Sanskrit poetry - visual and audio
 drishy kavy shabdon ke atirikt paatro kii veshbhusha, bhavabhangima, akruti, kriya or abhinay dwaara darshakon ke hriday main rasonmesh karaata he
 Cinematography is also called 'metaphor' because it is decorated with the eyes

 pun: padyakavy ke do upbhed kiye jate hai—mahakavy or khandakavy
 Khandakavya is also called 'muktakavya'
 khandakavy main mahakavy ke samaan jivan kaa sampoorn itivrutt na hokar kisi ek ansh kaa varnan kiya jaataa he— They are also called 'gitikavya' in Hindi only because of their predominance of musicality along with poetry
 ‘geeti’ kaa arth hriday kii ragaatmak bhaavana ko chandobaddh rup main prakat karnaa he
 The soul of Geeti is Bhavatirek
 apni ragaatmak anubhuti or kalpana ke kavi varnyavastu ko bhavatmak bana detaa he
 In Gitikavya, personal experience is easily expressed by freeing it from poetic traditions and traditions
 swaroopat: geetikavy kaa aakaar-prakaar mahakavy se chota hota he
 With the help of all these elements, Sanskrit muktakavya is considered to be an excellent poem
 muktkavy mahakavyon kii apeksha adhik lokapriy hue hai
 In Sanskrit, Gitikavya is found in both Muktak and Prabandha forms
 prabandhatmak geetikavy kaa sarvotkrisht udhaaharan meghdoot he
 Most of the arrangements are written on the emulation of this song
 muktak vah hajisamen prayek padya apane aap main swatantra hota he
 Beautiful examples of this are Amarukashatak and Bhatruhrishtakatraya
 sangitamay chand madhur padaavalee geetikavyon kii visheshta he
 Adornment, policy, quietness and nature are its main contender
 nari ke soundarya or swabhaav kaa swaabhaavik chithran in kaavyon main miltaa he
 Sources of sermon, policy and public behavior are received in a very delightful way
 yahi kaaran he ki muktakaavyon main sukhtiyon or subhashiton kii prapti prachurtaa se hoti he
 The tradition of muktakavya is derived from the Vedic era in the form of spontaneous messages
 rugveda main sarama naamak kute ko sandesavahak ke rup main bhejne kaa prasang he
 Examples of Vedic muktakavavya are notable, such as the Sukta of Vasistha and Vamadeva
 ramayana, mahabharat or unke parvarti granthon main bhi is prakaar ke sfoot prasang vipul maatra main uplabdh hote hai
 Perhaps this sentiment has been in the form of encryption in the Shakodagars of Mahakavi Valmiki
 pativiyukta pravasini sita ke prati preshit shri ram ke sandeshvahak hanuman, duryodhana ke prati dharmraj yudhisthir dwaara preshit shrikrishna or sundari dayamanti ke nikat raja nal dwaara preshit sandesavahak hans isi parampara ke antargat gine jane vaale prasang hai
 In this context, the Bhagavata Purana's Venugita is particularly quotable, whose sultry image is inscribed on the Sanskrit Muktakayakas
 rajasekhar ne kavicharya ke prakaran main bataaya he ki kavi ko vidyaon or upavidyaon kii shiksha grahan kerani chaiye
 Grammar, dictionary, verses, and ornamentation - these are the four disciplines

 vidwaanon kaa vichaar he ki maanav hriday anant rupatamak jagat ke naanaa roopon, vyapaaron main bhatakta rahata he, lekin jab maanav ahan kii bhaavana kaa parityag karke vishuddh anubhuti maatr rah jaataa he, tab vah mukt hriday ho jaataa he
 The word which the voice of man has been providing for the practice of this liberation of the heart is called poetry
 kavita manushya ko swaarth sambandhon ke sankuchit ghere se upar uthaati he or shesh sristi se ragaatmak sambandh jodne main sahaayak hoti he

 jis kavy kaa rasaswadan duusare se sunakar yaa swayan pard kar kiya jaataa he use shravy kavy kehete hai
 Such as Ramayana and Mahabharata
 shravy kavy ke bhi do bhed hote hai - prabandh kavy tathaa muktak kavy
 In this, a major story runs in the form of poetry from beginning to end
 katha kaa kram bich main kahin nahin tuutata or gaun kathaayen bich-bich main sahaayak ban kar aati hai
 Like Ramcharit Manas
 prabandh kavy ke do bhed hote hai - mahakavy evam khandakavy
 1- Epic In this, there is an autobiographical description of the entire life story of a historical or mythological great man
 mahakavy main ye baaten hona aavashyak hai- 2- Khandakavya does not describe anyone's entire biography but only one part of life
 khand kavy main ye baaten hona aavashyak hai- In this, only one verse or verse is able to reveal any emotion or rasa or story independently
 geet kavitt doha aadi muktak hote hai
 The poetry which Anandanubhuti realizes by seeing the act and listening to the narration from the characters is called visual poetry
 jaise naatak main yaa chalchitr main
 1- Verse poetry - In this, a story is described in poetry, like Gitanjali
 2- gadhy kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan gadhy main kiya jaataa he, jaise jaishankar kii kamayani

 Considerable criticism has been leveled against this practice, both by Hindu organizations as opposed to state funding of private pilgrimage outside India and by Muslim pressure groups
 As an example of the latter, Mohib Ahmad contends that even Air India's subsidized fare is higher than competing airlines' ordinary fare
 However, the government has continued offering the Haj subsidy despite protests from the Muslim community at large
 Syed Shahabuddin claims that Air India's rising costs for travel, and the consequent increases in the Government of India's subsidy, has resulted from differences in foreign exchange rates beyond the airline's control
 He suggests charter fares should be set at two-thirds of regular IATA fares, but points out that the Haj has higher costs than other charters because two empty flights are required to return the aircraft to India and to position the aircraft in Arabia for the pilgrims' return journey
 Shahabuddin maintains that the subsidy ought to be phased out because Hindus view the subsidy as preferential treatment of India's Muslim minority
 Other Muslim leaders have argued that the Hajj subsidy is "un-islamic" and that Hajj money should be invested in education and health instead
 moulana mahmud madani, a member of the rajya sabha and general secretary of the jamiat-e-ulema-e-hind, declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic sharia, since the quran declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources
 Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is unislamic
 Likewise, Hindu groups argue that a government sponsored Hajj subsidy forcibly taxes Hindus to pay for Muslim religious pilgrimages, and tantamounts to appeasement of Islam
 After considerable pressure from Muslim groups and the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Congress government in 2010 decided to begin phasing out the Haj subsidy that had been in operation since 1993
 The Central Haj Committee of India will work through the Ministry of External Affairs to restructure the air fares so that the richer Hajis will pay a premium for the poorer pilgirms
 The entire restructuring is expected to take about seven years and be completed by 2017
 In August 2010, the Minority Affairs Ministry formally opposed providing subsidy for Haj pilgrimage, saying the scheme — in operation since 1993— was contrary to the teachings of Islam
 The Government of India has proposed that starting from 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person will be decreased, and by 2017 will be ended completely
