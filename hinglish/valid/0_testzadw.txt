 Electrochemicals is the branch of physicochemical in which chemical reactions are studied that occur at the union of an electron conductor and an ionic conductor within a solution
 isamen electron chaalak koi dhaatu yaa ardhchaalak ho saktaa he
 If a chemical reaction occurs due to a potential charged from outside; If chemical potential is generated as a result of chemical reaction, then such chemical reactions are called electrochemical reactions
 saamaanya rup se dekhen to pate hai ki vidyut rasinic abhikriyaaon main oxikaran evam apchayan kriyaayein nihit hoti hai jo samay yaa sthaan main alag hoti hai or kisi bahari paripath se judi hoti hai
 Many chemicals can be converted from electricity to other chemicals
 yah vishay aaj bahut vishaal or mahatv kaa ho gaya he
 This is confirmed by the fact that many items sold in the market, such as metals, alloys, chemicals, furnishings, etc
, are made today by electrical methods
 vidyut vidhiyaan puraani avidyut vidhiyon kaa sthaan badi tivrata se le rahi hai
 Today, with the greater achievement of electric power, the electrochemical industries are developing more and more today
 rasinic kriyaaon main saadharantaya ooshmaa parivartan, ooshmaa kaa nishkasana, yaa ooshmaa kaa avasorana hota he, par kuch vishisht paristhitiyon main rasinic kriyaaon se vidyut urja kaa bhi utpaadan ho saktaa he
 Primary cells and batteries are a good example of the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy

 In electrical chemical changes, the electrical current is decomposed into sodium and chlorine
 iske parinamswaroop hamen daahak soda, hydrogen or chlorine praapt hote hai
 All three of them are of great importance from the industrial point of view

 is sambandh main farade ne kuch niyamon kaa pratipaadan kiya he, jo "farade ke niyam" ke naam se suprasiddh hai
 One rule is that "the amount of chemical dissolution from the current is proportional to the amount of current flowing"
 doosraa niyam he ki "yadi vibhinn yogicon main vidyut dhara pravaahit kii jaae, to electrode par praapt vibhinn padaarthon kii maatra unke rasinic tulyank bhaar ke anupaat main hoti he
 Validation of both these rules has been proved by experiments
 jab koi lavan pani main ghulata he, tab vah saadharantaya do bhaagon main bant jaataa he
 These are called "ions"
 kuch yanon par dhanavesh rahata he or kuch yanon par rinavesh rahata he
 But due to the same amount of charge, the solution is electrically neutral
 aise vilyan main vidyut ke pravaahit karne se runayan ek electrode par or dhanayan duusare electrode par unmukt hote hai
 The compounds that break down into ions are the conductors of electricity
 aise yogic saamanyat: amla, kshar or lavan hote hai
 Such solutions, which are the conductors of electricity, are called electrolytes
 kuch lavan dravit avasthaa main vidyut chaalak hote hai
 When electrolytes are generated by electrolytes, they are called electrolytes
 vidyut apghaton se aaj anke vastuen taiyaar hoti hai
 Its most important use is in electrification

 jeevashmiki kii paribhaasha dete hue tweb hofel or aak ne likhaa he : jeevashmiki vah vigyaan he, jo aadim paudhen tathaa jantuon ke ashmibhoot avasheshon dwaara prakat bhootkaaleen bhugarbhik yugon ke jeevanaki vyakhya karata he
 Thus it is clear that paleontology studies primitive animals on the basis of their volatile remains
 jeevashm shabd se hi yah ingit hota he ki jeev + ashm kaa adhyayan he
 The term Palaentology in English also refers to the study of Palaios = Ancient + Onto = Fauna
 jeevashm vigyaan kaa adhyayan jeevigyaan kii nai shakha he or iskaa vikaas gat 200 varshon se hi adhik hua he
 Long before the development of this branch of science, it was in the knowledge of the primitive human beings that in some types of rocks, a strange type of remains are found which correspond to marine organisms
 gyaan ke abhaav main usne pehle-pahal in avasheshon ko jaivik utpatti kaa na samajhakar, prakruti ke vinod kii saamagree samaj rakhaa tha, jo prithvi ke andar kisi shakti ke kaaran ban gaye
 But, with the increase of knowledge, man had to change his thoughts in this direction too and he discovered that the remains of the remains found in the rocks were living creatures at some time and the place where Today we find these fossils was in the womb of the sea in geological ages
 san 1820 tak keval 127 ashmibhoot vanaspatiyon tathaa 2,100 jantuon kaa hi pataa chalaa tha, jo 1840 tak badhkar kramash: 2,050 tathaa 24,300 kii sankhya tak pahunch gaya
 Since then, these numbers have increased unprecedentedly
 maanav kshamta ke adheen yah sambhav nahin he ki sansar ke jine bhi jeevashmon ke strot hai, un sabaki khojbin kar lee jaae
 Secondly, life on Earth has been originating since billions of years ago
 tisare, sansar kii bhugolic akruti jaisi aaj drushtigochar hoti he, waisi un dinon nahin thi
 Animals used to move from one place to another
 at: hamen unke ashmibhoot namoonon se jo gyaan praapt hota yaa ho saktaa he, vah vicchhinn hi he, yaa hoga
 In the end, it is never possible that all the creatures who were present in that dark age of history, all of them have already been pornized
 ashmikaran kii kuch dashaayen hoti hai, jinke kaaran jeevajantu ke mrit shariron kaa ashmikaran ho jaataa he
 The vulgarization of all creatures is neither necessary nor possible
 is kaaran bhi aadi jeevon ke jivan kaa shrunkhalabaddh itihaas likhnaa duruh kaary he
 On the basis of all the fossil evidence we have received so far, there is a lot of light on the evolution of organisms
 jeevashmon ke adhyayan se hamen un jeevon kaa pataa chalata he jo ab yaa to lupt ho gaye hai, yaa unka vartmaan swaroop paryaapt parivartit ho gaya he
 Fossils are remnants of ancient creatures, which have become stone like stones in stones or other places
 jeevon ke kuch aise bhi avshesh praapt hue hai, jo prastirbhoot na hokar apane mul rup main hi hai
 Dead bodies of mammoths and other animals found in the icebergs are safe in museums in Russia and England and America
 jeevashm bhi, aadhunik jeevon kii akruti se, newnaadhik rup main, milte-julate hai
 Fossils are found only in sedimentary rocks
 anek prakaar ke jeevajantuon kii anek paristhitiyon main mrityu ke uparaant unke shavon par jo avsaad jamaa haate hate hai, kalantar main ve hi jeevashm ban jaaya karte hai
 Some fossils are so complete that even after their molecular examination, even the cell compositions of organisms are visible
 jeevon ke ashmibhoot pramaan apane jivit sharir ke rup main hi mil jaaen, yah aavashyak nahin he
 In their bodies, disorder arises due to decay, oxidation, deforming by predatory organisms, cold, rain, sunlight etc
 kuch jantu, jinke sharir calcium carbonate, silica aadi jaise acarbonic padaarthon dwaara bane hote hai, unpar vikaar kaa prabhaav apekshaakrit kam padataa he
 Fossils of such organisms are available in very small numbers
 jo uplabdh hai bhi ve aadhunik jivit jeevon se tulana karne ke liye apurna hai
 Another feature of organisms is that fossils of one type are found only in certain types of rocks
 in shilakhandon se jeevashmon ke purna jivan ke parivesh kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Fossils also show how the organism used to live and what it used to eat
 inase tatkaaleen bhugolic paristhitiyon par bhi prakaash padataa he
 Fossils found in snow fields or the entire biosphere have proved to be a boon for fossil scientists
 visheshat: siberia ke sudur uttar dhruvasagariya kshetra main lagbhag sampurna jeev jyon ke tyon praapt hue hai
 They throw a lot of light on the creatures of the distant past
 saadhaaran rup se jantuon ke sharir ke kade bhaag-haddiyaan, daant, khol aadi-prastareekrut ho jate hai
 Lall described the city of Pampei, Italy as 'jeevashmanagar', stating that at least 2,000 people died in this beautiful city as a result of the rise of the Visuvius volcano in 79 CE
 jwalamukhi kii dadhakati aag, tapt raakh aadi ne sampurna nagar ko kai foot moti part se dhank diya
 Finally, large burning pieces of the mountain penetrated inside the windows and doors of the houses and buried the dead humans and animal bearers inside them

 Sometimes, the hollow bones of vulgar animals, such as the skull, bones of the extremities, fat or marrow within the shells, are destroyed and other substances get depressed
 kalantar main ye itane kathor ho jate hai ki yadi upree khol ko tod diya jaae to bheetar ek murti jaisi pratikruti jaati he
 Similarly, the footprints of swamps, wet soils and cattlemen on the ground have also become obscured
 in padchihnon se jantuon ke pairon ke talvon kii rachanakriti evam aakaar kaa hi gyaan nahin hota varan unke avaagaman ke maarg kaa bhi nirdesh hota he
 The feast of some animals is also obtained in the vulgar form
 inke rasinic adhyayan se un jantuon ke aahaar kaa gyaan hota he
 Other small fish or insects, pests, cattle, undercooked meat, etc
 have also been found in the food grain of some sea fishes and other animals
 in jeevashmon ko ateet kii thati samajhnaa chahie kyonki inase prithvi ke lakhon karodon varsh purv kii avasthaa ke pramaan milte hai
 Fossils help a lot in determining the identity of rocks and the sequence of these levels
 inaki kuch pramukh upyogitaayen nimnlikhit hai : Chronological - On the basis of evidence engraved in fossils or found in complete or incomplete form, the ancient geological condition is revealed
 kisi bhugarbhik kalvishesh kaa nirdhaaran karne main jeevashmon se bahut sahaayta milti he
 The stratigraphic position or stratum configuration has been considered to be inseparable relation to fossils
 prithvi par jo bhautik-rasinic parivartan pehle ho chuke hai, lagbhag vaise hi parivartan aaj bhi ho rahe hai
 However, organisms have evolved gradually
 unka jo swaroop pehle tha, usamen mahaan, antar pad gaya he
 The nature of mineral materials has been variable even though the nature of organic matter has changed
 at: khanij padarthyukt shailakhandon se unki pracheenta kaa nirdhaaran kathin hota he
 But studying the sediments of fossils found between them makes this task simple
 kuch jeevashmon ko nirdeshak jeevashm kii sangya is aadhaar par de di gai he ki unase yah siddh ho jaataa he ki amuk jantu yaa vanaspati amuk bhugarbhik kaal main hi utpann hue yaa ho sakate hai
 Primitive surroundings - For the life of animals, whether they are vegetation, animals, special types of geographical environment are suitable
 duusare shabdon main kah sakate hai ki vishesh vaataavaran main vishesh prakaar ke jeev jantu jivit rahete hai
 The fossils reveal what kind of geographical environment was there for the living of the then living animals
 in jeevajantuon kii mrityu kis prakaar hui athwa kis sthaan par kis avasthaa main hui thi, isaki bhi ek jhalak jeevashm de dete hai
 Along with this, fossils throw a lot of light on the extent and extent of ancient land, sea, reservoir etc
, the migration of animals and birds etc
 inhen jeevashmon ke adhyayan kaa parinaam yah hua ki ki pracheenkaaleen bhaugalik maanchitron kii rachana saral evam sulabh ho sakati he
 a new science has been born to study the geographical environment revealed by fossils, which is called archaeology
 puraparisthitiki -sajiv praaniyon ko jivit rahane ke liye vividh prakaar ke pariveshon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Some organisms live above or within the body of other organisms; These are called parasites or parasites
 kuch jeev anya jeevon ke nikat sampark main yaa unase sanlagn rahakar apana jivan nirvaah karte hai
 Knowledge of this interconnection of fauna by fossils is readily available to us
 jeevon kaa udvivikas -charles darwin ke jeevon ke udvivikas sambandhi siddhant kii pushti ke liye jin pusht pramaanon yaa tarkon ko unke samarthak upasthit kiya karte hai, unamem 'jeevashmiya pramaan' bhi ek he
 Each fossil is in itself a proof of its own power of biology
 inke adhyayan se inke kramik vikaas par prachur prakaash padataa he
 The study of fossils suggests that there was a time in ancient times, when the Earth was invaded by dinosaur giant animals, or the surviving remains of Silacanthus fishes are probably gone
 isi prakaar, udvivikas sambandhi anya anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan jeevashm karte rahe hai
 Paleontology is divided into several branches
 suvidha kii drushti se ab yah niyam sa ban gaya he ki jab ham 'jeevashmiki' shabd kaa upyog karte hai tab hamaara abhipraay keval aksheruki jeevon ke jeevashmon ke adhyayan se hota he
 The branch of paleontology under which vertebrate fossils are studied is called vertebrate paleontology
 padap jeevashmon kaa adhyayan ek bhinn shakha ke antargat kiya jaataa he jise padpashm vigyaan kehete hai
 In modern times, some other major branches of paleontology have also developed, whose fields of study are very small organisms and fossil humans respectively
 jeevashmiki kaa kshetra bada vyapak he or uski seemaa nishchit rup se nirdhaarit nahin kii ja sakati
 If viewed theoretically, the emergence of fossilism begins with the evolution of an organism on Earth, but on geological grounds it can only be said that half of the history of the entire organism on Earth, or even less, We find the records of creatures
 jeevashm vaigyanik anveshanon kaa prarambhkaal aise pracheenatam prapya jeevashmon se kiya ja saktaa he jinke jaivik gun jaivikeey aadhaar par batalaaye ja sakate hai
 Paleontology has a very close relationship with geology, especially layered-rock-geology
 ateet kaal ke jeevon ke avshesh starit shailon main paae jate hai
 The fossils found in them have been very helpful in the construction of these rocks and in establishing their sequence
 vastav main bina jeevashmon ke starit-shail-bhoumiki, ek prakaar se, vyaavhaarik jeevashmiki he
 Paleontology has a close relationship with biology
 jaiviki ke antargat vartmaan jivit praaniyon or padpon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, jab ki jeevashmiki main bhoumikeey yugon ke un jeevon or padpon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he jo kabhi jivit the or ab jeevashm ke rup main hi prapya hai
 But paleontology cannot be considered a branch of biology, as the material of the study of paleontology and the manner of its collection are completely different from the material of the study of biology and the manner of its collection
 yah nishchit karnaa ki kis sthaan par jeevashmiki ko jaiviki se pruthak kiya ja saktaa he, praaia: asambhav sa he
 But roughly the end of fossils and the beginning of biology can be traced back to the Sandhisthana of the ultra-new age and modern era
 is prakaar se anishchit or sandigdh cambrian-purv mahakalp praani evam padapjaat tathaa vartmaan kaal ke nishchit tathaa anek prakaar ke jeevon or padpon ke bich main anek tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke jeev avshesh milte hai, jo jeev par prakaash daalate hai
 These fossils found in the sedimentary rocks of Bhuparpti are the basis of the study of paleontology
 jeevigyaani jeevashmiki main isliye atyadhik abhiruchi rakhte hai ki iskaa jeevvikas jaise vishay se nikat sambandh he
 The history or species of species of animals and plants can be traced more confidently based on the study of fossils derived from the sequenced levels of layered rocks
 parantu jeevon ke apurna abhilekh ke kaaran unke jativrutt ke anurekhan main atyadhik baadha padati he, kyonki bhoumikeey yugon main paae janevaale praaniyon or padpon main se kuch hi or unamem se adhikansh apurna dasha main, in shailon main parilakshith paae jate hai
 In spite of this incompleteness of the inscription, in many organisms, when they are traced from one level to the other, the changes take place
 jab jeevashmon ke praturup vibhinn anukramit staron se ekatrit kiye jate hai, tab pratyaksh rup se do bhinn dikhaai padanevaali jatiyaan bich ke jeevashmon dwaara sambandhit dikhaai padati hai or nimnatam str main pai janevaali jati se lekar ucchtam str main milanevaali jati tak ke bichwaale staron ke jeevashmon ke jeevon main hue parivartanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 In addition to the standard method, comparative methods of body and personality can also be used to detect caste from fossils
 at: jeevashmiki is dharna kii pushti karata he ki jeevvikas shanai: shanai: tathaa kramash: honevaale parivartanon ke parinamswaroop hua
 There is also evidence to suggest that the evolution of organism was evolutionary
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kuch jeevon ke varg main jeevvikasiya parivartan yug ugantar tak kisi nishchit disha main hue or iske atirikt aise sambhddha varg jo ek hi paitruk utpatti ke hai, ek duusare se tathaa bahya dashaon se bina prabhavit hue, apane vikaas main samaan avasthaaon athwa usase milti julati avasthaaon main se gujarey, jisase yah prakat ho jaataa he ki jeevon ke vibhinn virgon main vikaas kii disha, sarsaadhaaran purvaj se paitruk gunon dwaara nishchit ho jaati he
 Tracing the complete stages of development from the unicellular egg of the living plants and animals to the final stage, is subject to geology and organism
 kisi varg ke padpon or praaniyon kii jatiyon kaa vikaas, kam se kam apni praarambhik avasthaaon main lagbhag samaan hota he or ek varg ke antargat aanevaale sampurna bhrunon main, kisi ek avasthaa tak ek duusare main itani sadrishyata hoti he ve pruthak nahin kiye ja sakate
 This fact has revealed excessive fraternity in shapes that are highly different from one another in adulthood
 is baat kii vaastaviktaa kasherukiyon main dekhne ko milti he, jinke bhrun praarambhik avasthaaon main ati kathinaayee ke saath ek duusare se alag kiye ja sakate hai or jo bahut dhire dhire apane varg athwa gana kii lakshanik akritiyon ko dhaaran kar lete hai
 The results of these embryological explorations have a special relationship with paleontology
 aise anek jeevashm jaankaree main hai jo apane main apane se sambandhit aadhunik jeevon kii tulana main bhruneey, athwa kam se kam dimbhiy, athwa kishoravasa ke lakshan dikhaate hai
 Examples of this type of primitive embryonic types are found especially in vertebrates, as skeletons become obscured during the very early period of life
 at: aadhunik jeevon kii apraudh avasthaaon kii tulana sidhe praudh jeevashm se kii ja sakati he
 Giving definite names to fossils is important to the paleontologist so that he can distinguish more accurately among fossils
 jeevashmon kaa namakaran saamanyat: unheen siddhanton par aadhaarit he jinpar praaniyon kaa
 Pranijagat is divided into many sanghas and each sangha is divided into several classes, gana, clans, clans and castes
 jeevashmon ke kai prakaar ke praroop hote hai
 If the investigator describes an entire caste on the basis of a model of a fossil of that caste, then that fossil model is called the name of that caste
 yadi kisi ek ke namprarup kaa nishchay karne main anveshak anya jeevashm namoonon kii sahaayta letaa he, to in atirikt namoonon ko paratip kehete hai
 If the investigator takes the help of many other fossil specimens without deciding the name, then these fossil specimens are called Sahuparup
 yadi kisi jati ke jeevashm kaa sahpraroop us jati ke praarambhik varnan ke pashchaat kii us jati kaa praaroop chun jaataa he, to vah jeevashm praroop lactotip kehalaata he
 Just as there are fossil specimens to describe a caste, similarly there are caste or homogeneous fossils to describe a lineage
 yadi koi anveshak kisi ek nae vansh kaa varnan kisi ek vishesh jati ke aadhaar par karata he, to vah jati us vansh ke liye jenoholotip ho jaati he
 If the investigator gives a list of such castes in the description of the new dynasty that he considers to be under the new lineage, then all these species are called genocyntypes
 bahut se jenocentipon main se baad main aadi anveshak dwaara athwa baad main kisi anya anveshak dwaara ek jenolectotip chhaanta ja saktaa he
 The geological period is divided into five major parts
 ye kramash: nimnlikhit hai- Archaeozoic Mahakalp is the oldest among them
 bhoumikeey kaal ke in paanch mahakalpon main vibhaajan mukhyat: in mahakalpon main milanevaale praaniyon or padpon ke jeevashmon par hi aadhaarit he
 Of these, the Archeozoic Great Canyon was fauna
 is mahakalp main na kisi prakaar ke jeevajantu or na paudhe hi the
 Therefore, we do not find any fossils in the rocks of this period
 pragjeev mahakalp main protozoa jaise ati saadhaaran prakaar ke jeevajantu astitv main aae
 But due to the lack of any tough part in these ordinary organisms, they could not be preserved in the rocks
 at: pragjeev mahakalp ke shailon main bhi jeevashm nahin milte
 The other three Mahakalpas, namely, the Puranjeevi Mahakalpa, the Madhyamajeeva Mahakalpa and the Nutanjeevi Mahakalpa are fossiliferous
 in mahakalpon ke antargat aanevaale jitne bhi chote se lekar bade tak vibhaajan hai ve sab purnat: us kaal main paae janevaale jeevon ke jeevashm par hi aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, we see that the work of layered paleontologists cannot run without the help of paleontology
 yahi kaaran he ki jeevashm vigyaan starit shailavigyaan kaa merudand kehalaata he
 On the basis of paleontology broadly, the following four main animal and plant ethnic superpowers can be established: purv purajivi mahakalp - iske antargat cambrian, ordovishan or silyurian kalp aate hai
 Answer: The archaeological Mahakalpa - Dioni, Carboni and Permian Kalpa are covered under it
 madhyajivi mahakalp Nutanjeev Mahakalpa - Abhinav Kaal is also under it
 praaia: sab pramukh aksheruki praaniyon ke pratinidhi jeevashm cambrin staron main paae jate hai or unamem se trilobite jaise kuch praani adicrambrian kaal main hi apekshaya adhik viksit ho chuke the
 Hence the assumption that the ancestors of all classes found in the Cambrian strata were found in the pre-cambrian period, although their remains are not found in the Cambrian pre-shales
 yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki cambrionpurv samudron main sab prakaar ke praani rahete the, parantu ve sab komalangi purvaj the, jinhone apane astitv ke vishay main kisi bhi prakaar ke chihr nahin chhoden hai
 Since all types of animals are directly or indirectly dependent on plants, and plants only have the power to process inorganic foods, it also seems reasonable to assume that plants existed in the pre-cambrian period
 parantu yah aashcharya kii baat he ki paudhon ke avshesh purajivi mahakalp ke staron main nahin paae gaye hai
 Following is a brief description of the main characteristics of the zoological world of the predecessor Mahakalpa: yah matsay or parnang samaan sthal padpon kaa, jinhen terridosperms kehete hai, yug tha
 Along with these were found goniotites, spiriferid bahupad and rugos coral
 madhyajivi mahakalp sarisrupon or amonites kaa kalp kehalaata he
 Along with them, rinconilids and corals were also prominent in the Belemnites Brachiopoda
 yah kalp staniyon, pakshiyon, foraminipheron or aavrutabiji padpon kaa kaal tha
 On the basis of animals and plants, we cannot separate the new life cycle from modern times
 sampurna shailon ke anukram kaa kram bhalee bhanti nishchay ho jane or unamem paae janevaale jeevashmon kii pahchaan ho jane ke uparaant yah pataa chalaa ki jeevon ke vikaas main shanai:-shanai: pragati hui
 The most common types of organisms first appeared, which are found in the oldest sedimentary rocks, and after that the complex organisms gradually came to the Tarunatar rocks
 is prakaar sampurna aksheruki sanghon ke pratinidhi, jo jeevashm rup main parirakshan yogya hai, cambrian shailon main milte hai, parantu prayek sangh ke antargat paae janevaale jeev apni rachana main praaia: samaan the or bahut kam parivartan dikhaate the
 On morphological basis, we may call them underdeveloped lineages, but in later ages the composition of organisms found in each association was more varied and this fact is confirmed to some extent by the increase in the number of lineages
 kasherukiyon main rachana ke aadhaar par aadim varg samajha janevaala cychlosotomata varg he, jiskaa sabase pehle pradurbhaav hua or jiske uparaant kramash: matsay, ubhaychar, sarisrup, pakshi or stani aae or ye varg usee kram se prakat hote gaye jaisaa unki rachana se aashaa kii jaati thi
 Thus, the order of acquisition of organisms in the geological ages proves the truth of the theory of biology, because the older the shells are, the simpler their living remains are and as such the study of the nearest rocks according to the geological time table Such complex organism remains are found
 jeevvikasiya siddhant kaa pratipaadan karne ke liye ghode ke vikaas kaa adhyayan acha udhaaharan he
 All the material on which the history of horse development is based is derived from tertiary rocks of North America

 The horse of the Middle Eocene is known as Orohippus, which was only slightly larger than Eohippus in size
 uttar iosin kaa ghoda apihipus kehalaata he, jiske vishay main puri jaankaree nahin he
 The horse, popularly known as Mesohippus, is found in the lower and middle Oligocene rocks
 yah aakaar main bhed ke baraabar, yaa usase kuch chota, tha
 Myohypus, which was found in the later Oligocene and lower Myocene eras, was only slightly larger than sheep
 parahipas nimna myosin yug main ati prachur tha
 The horse of the Middle Myocene was called Mericippes
 jo parahipas hi ke samaan tha
 The Pleocene era horse, Plyohippus, was equivalent in size to a donkey, but the tertiary era was equivalent to a horse found in the present period
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki ghode ke aakar main dhire-dhire vruddhi hui
 Similarly, changes in the internal structure of horse's arms and legs increased its speed
 is parivartan kaa mukhya lakshan parshv bhaagon kaa hraas or madhya athwa aksheeya bhaag kaa vistaar or vardhan tha, jisase vah daudte samay dridhtaa ke saath bojha sambhaal sake
 Similarly, everything other than the bone between the wrists was depleted, which made the wrist firm
 isi prakaar tisare angul kii vruddhi hui, aas paas ke anya angul lupt ho gaye or ant main keval vahi rah gaya
 Similarly, the head and cervix grew slowly, allowing the horse to graze easily

 Without Gandhiji's unified personality, the Indian National Congress began to split into two parties during his two years in prison, one party led by Chitta Ranjan Das and Motilal Nehru, who favored the party's participation in the House
 The leadership was led by Chakravarti Rajagopalacharya and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel

 In protest against this, Gandhiji took a six-day hunger strike in September 1932, which forced the government to successfully adopt a similar system of mediation by Palvankar Balu, a Dalit-turned-political leader
 achhuton ke jivan ko sudhaarney ke liye gandhi ji dwaara chalaae gaye is abhiyaan kii shuruuaat thi

 Ambedkar and his allies also felt that Gandhiji was undermining the political rights of Dalits
 haalanki gandhi ji ek vaisya jati main paidaa hue phir bhi unhonen is baat par jor diya ki vah dow ambedkar jaise dalit masiha ke hote hue bhi vah daliton ke liye aawaaj uthaa saktaa he
 Untouchability was a major evil in the social evils of India during the Indian freedom struggle, against which Mahatma Gandhi and his followers struggled

 In the meeting, on the basis of majority given by 77 percent of the devotees, the entry of Harijans into the temple was approved and thus the entry of Harijans as a success of the determination day in Sri Guruvayur temple in Kerala from 1 January 1934, in principle Got approval
 guruvayur mandir jisamen aaj bhi gaiyr hinduon kaa pravesh varjit he tathaapi kai dharmon ko maanane vaale bhagwaan bhagwaan guruvayurappan ke param bhakt hai

 Gandhi had differences with Subhash Bose, who was elected to the presidency in 1938
 bose ke saath matbhedon main gandhi ke mukhya bindu bose kii loktantr main patibaddhta kii kami tathaa ahimsa main vishwaas kii kami thi
 Bose won for the second time in spite of Gandhi's criticism, but left the Congress when all Indian leaders abandoned all the principles implemented by Gandhiji

 As the war progressed Gandhiji intensified his demand for independence by giving the British the Quit India Movement
 yah gandhi tathaa congress party kaa sarvaadhik spasht vidroh tha jo bhartiya seemaa se angrejon ko khadedane par lakshith tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru's party, sitting second to Gandhiji, was criticized by some members of the party and by some other political Indian parties who believed in both the British and the opposition
 kuch kaa maananaa tha ki apane jivan kaal main athwa maut ke sangharsh main angrejon kaa virodh karnaa ek nashwar kaary he jabaki kuch maanate the ki gandhi ji paryaapt koshish nahin kar rahe hai
 Quit India became the most powerful movement of this struggle which led to widespread violence and arrest

 He said that the order of chaos around him is worse than real anarchy

 Gandhiji and all members of the Congress Working Committee were arrested by the British on 9 August 1942 in Mumbai
 gandhi ji ko pune ke anga khan mahal main do saal tak bandi banaakar rakhaa gaya
 This was the time when Gandhiji suffered two deep blows in his personal life

 Six weeks later, Gandhiji also suffered from severe malaria

 At the end of the war, the British gave a clear indication that the Santha would be transferred and handed over to the Indians
 is samay gandhi ji ne andolan ko band kar diya jisase congressi netaaon sahit lagbhag 100,000 rajnatik bandiyon ko reeha kar diya gaya
 In 1946, Gandhiji advised the Congress to reject the proposal of the British kbnet Mission as he was deeply skeptical of the proposed grouping for Muslim dominated provinces, hence Gandhi viewed the episode as a rehearsal of a partition
 haalanki kuch samay se gandhi ji ke saath congress dwaara matbhedon vaali ghatana main se yah bhi ek ghatana bani chunki nehru or patel jaanate the ki yadi congress is yojana kaa anumodan nahin karti he tab sarkaar kaa niyantran muslim lig ke paas chalaa jayega
 Between 1948, over 5000 people were killed during the violence
 gandhi ji kisi bhi aisi yojana ke khilaaf the jo bharat ko do alag alag deshon main vibhajit kar de
 The overwhelming majority of many Hindus and Sikhs and Muslims living in India were in favor of the partition of the country
 iske atirikt mohammad ali jinna, muslim lig ke netaa ne, pashchim punjab, sindh, uttar pashchim seemaant praant or purvi bengal main vyapak sahyog kaa parichay diya
 In order to stop the widespread hindu-muslim fighting, Congress leaders gave their approval to this plan of partition

 Close associates of Gandhiji accepted Partition as the best solution and Sardar Patel tried to convince Gandhiji that this was the only way to prevent a war with civil unrest

 He held intense discussions with leaders of Muslim and Hindu communities in North India as well as Bengal to calm the warm attitude

 He started his first fast-unto-death in Delhi asking for immediate end to communal violence for all and to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan
 gandhi ji ko dar tha ki pakistan main asthirataa or asuraksha se bharat ke prati unka gussa or bad jayega tathaa seemaa par hinsa fail jaaegi
 He further feared that Hindus and Muslims would renew their enmity again and that there could be a possibility of a civil war
 jivan bhar gandhi ja kaa saath dene vaale sahyogiyon ke saath bhavuk bahes ke baad gandhi ji ne baat kaa maanane se inkaar kar diya or sarkaar ko apni niti par adig rahanaa padaa tathaa pakistan ko bhugtan kar diya

 In line with these ideas, in 1940, when the invasions by Nazi Germany on the British islands appeared imminent, Gandhiji asked the British to follow the following policy of non-violence in peace and war

 gandhi ji ne landan main rahete samay or uske baad shaakaahaari bhojan kii vakaalat karne main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 Gandhiji said that vegetarian food not only fulfills the needs of the body but it also serves the economic purpose which is made of meat and yet meat is more expensive than grains, vegetables and fruits
 iske alaava kai bhartiya jo aay kam hone kii vajah se sangharsh kar rahe the, us samay jo shaakaahaari ke rup main dikhaai de rahe the vah aadhyatmik parampara hi nahin vyaavhaarikta ke kaaran bhi tha

 Gandhiji used to make fruit from the beginning, but started drinking goat's milk on the advice of his doctor
 He never used to consume milk-products because earlier he believed that milk is not a natural diet of man and he was fed with cow's milk
 Chitkaar Seghrina was, and the most important reason was the oath which he made to his late mother

 This decision was completely influenced by the philosophy of Brahmacharya
 Spiritual and practical purity is largely associated with celibacy and disinterestedness
 Gandhi saw celibacy as the primary basis for getting closer to God and identifying himself in his autobiography
 The childhood bride tells her libido and Ishrya's struggles with Kasturba
 She realized that this person They have a duty to remain celibate so that they can learn the love of lust instead
 For Gandhi, celibacy meant "control of thoughts, words and actions within the senses"

 Gandhi used to wear silence one day a week
 He believed that by refraining from speaking, he gets inner peace
 This influence of Hindu silence theory on him, and he used to contact others by writing on paper on those days, for three and a half years from the age of 37, Gandhiji refused to read newspapers, in response to which he said The steady state of the world today has confused him more than his own inner turmoil

 After returning from South Africa, where he had completed advocacy and was associated with wealth and success, he renounced western-style clothes
 He accepted the clothes worn by India's poorest man, and Gandhi also advocated wearing home-made clothes
 Gandhi and his followers adopted the practice of weaving their own clothes through cotton and others like it
 Encouraged to work
 Although Indian workers were often lazy due to unemployment, they often bought their clothes from industrial manufacturers intended to serve British interests
 Gandhi's opinion was that if Indians started making their own clothes, it would be an economic shock to the British settled in India
 Consequently, the charkha was later included in the Indian national flag
 He wore a dhoti later in the rest of his life to reflect his ordinary life

 Oliver Twist is notable for its dull portrayal of criminals committed by Dickens and his hideous life

 The first example of a social novel, this book focuses the attention of the people towards various contemporary evils, implying poor law according to which poor people should work in workshops / poor houses, child labor and recruitment of children is a crime
 dikkence ne upanyaas ke gambhir vishyon ko vyangy or kaale hasya ke saath jodakar samay ke chal kapat kaa uphaas kiya he
 The novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blinco, the story of an orphaned child laborer who resembled a child laborer in a cotton mill whose hardships became widely known in the 1830s

 Oliver Twist is born into poverty and an unfortunate life in a workshop in an unnamed city
 
 santaan prasav ke samay maa kii maut or uske pita kii aspashtikrut anupasthiti ke kaaran janm se hi lagbhag anaath oliver ko kifaayat se garibi kanoon kii sharton ke tahat pradaan kiya gaya he or usne apane jivan ke pratham aath varsh shrimati maan naam kii ek mahila kii 'dekhbhaal' main baby farm main vyateet kiye he
 Along with other child criminals against the Poor Law, Oliver has been brought up with less food and some rest
 nauven janmdin ke aasapaas shri bumbal, ek basti kaa karmchaaree, oliver ko baby farm se le gaye or use usee mukhya kaaryshaala main okam chunane ke kaam par laga diya jahaan uski maa mrityu se pehle kaam kiya karti thi
 Oliver, who worked hard with very little food, remained in the workshop for six months until the desperate hungry boys decided to get plenty of food that the loser should ask for another portion of oatmeal
 To do this, Oliver was chosen, who came forward with a bowl in the next stroke of food and expressed his famous request: "sir, please, i want more
" parinamswaroop ek bahut bada hangaamaa hua
 Sophisticated gentlemen of the workshop administration board, eating a meal fit for a mighty king, offered that they would give five pounds to anyone who was willing to take the boy as an apprentice
 ek krur chimney sweep ne oliver ko lagbhag praapt kar liya tha lekin jab oliver ne "us bhayanak aadmi" ke saath na bhejne ke liye bahut anurodh kiya to ek dayaalu puraane magistrate ne anubandhpatr par hastakshar karne se inkaar kar diya
 baad main, shri sourberi, basti dwaara niojit pratibhu, ne oliver ko apni seva main le liya
 He put Oliver on better, and because of the boy's sad face, he used him as a weaver at children's funerals
 haalanki, shri sourberi apni shaadi se naakhush the or unki patni ko oliver naapsand tha jiskaa mukhya kaaran yah tha vah uske pati ko pasand aane laga tha -or isliye vah aadhe pet khaanaa or use gaali dene ke kuch avasaro ko kho detii thi
 They also suffered at the hands of Noa Claypole, a naive but vile fellow apprentice who was jealous of Oliver's wordless stud and Charlote, Sowerberry's maid, who loved Noa
 ek din ek oliver ko pralobhan dene ke ke prayaas main nuh ne uski mrit maa ko "regular rhite-down bed un" kahkar unka apmaan kar diya
 oliver main ek apratyaashit junun bhar gaya or usne hamalaa kar diya, yahaan tak ki vah bahut bade ladakon ko bhi parrast karne laga
 shrimati sourberi ne noah kaa paksh liya or oliver ko vash main karne main uski madad kii, oliver ko ghunse maare or uski pitayee kii or baad main apane pati or shri bumbal ko oliver kii phir se pitayee karne ke liye majaboor kiya, jo ladaai ke parinaam swaroop bheja gaya tha
 When Oliver is sent to her room for the night, he does something he never did in his boyhood, he breaks down and starts crying
 That night alone, Oliver finally decided to run away
 vah aise hi bina kisi uddeshy ke tab tak bhatakta rahaa jab tak ek milastone ne uske bhatakate pairo ko landan ke liye mode nahin diya
 During his visit to London, Oliver met Jack Dawkins, commonly known as the "artful Dodger", although Oliver's innocent nature saved him from recognizing that the boy was dishonest
 doser ne oliver ko muft bhojan pradaan kiya or use landan main ek sajjan kaa pataa batalaaya jo "use bina kisi chiz ke badale rahane ko jagah degaa or badlaav ke liye bhi kabhi nahin kahegaa"
 apratyaashit sahaayta ke liye abhaari oliver ne "vruddh sajjan" ke nivas par jane ke liye doser kaa anusaran kiya
 Meanwhile, Oliver meets a notorious Jewish criminal named Fagin, whom the Artful Dodger told
 bahekaave main aakar kuch samay ke liye oliver fegin or uske jebkataron ke giroh ke saath seferan hill par rahaa parantu vah unke aapraadhik vyavsaayon se anjaan tha
 He used to think that they make purses and handkerchiefs
 baad main, oliver artphul doser or ek vinodi prakruti ke charlie bets naam ke ek ladke ke saath roomaal banane ke liye baahar chalaa jaataa he kyonki aay kaa koi saadhan nahin tha
 Oliver realizes too late that his real mission is to cut the pockets
 doser or charlie ne shri brownlo naam ke ek vruddh sajjan kaa roomaal chori kiya or turant bhaag gaye
 When Mr
 Brownlow learns that his handkerchief is missing, he looks at Oliver and follows him
 anya log bhi uskaa peechha karne main shaamil hone lage or oliver pakadaa gaya or use magistrate ke saamne le jaaya gaya
 Interestingly, Mr
 Brownlow had a second opinion about the boy, reluctant to believe he was a pickpocket
 nyaayadhish kii spasht niraashaa ke liye, ek bukstaal dharak jisane doser ko aparaadh karte dekha tha oliver ko chhudaa liya jo ab tak vastav main biimaar ho chukaa tha or adaalat main behosh ho gaya
 Mr
 Brownlow, along with his maid Mrs
 Bedwin, took Oliver home and served him
 oliver shri brownlo ke saath rahane laga or teji se thik hone laga or anbhyast dayalutaa se khilne laga
 haalanki uske anand main us samay baadha utpann ho gayi jab fegin ko dar lagane laga ki oliver "uske aapraadhik giroh par" aadu ho saktaa he, to usne nirnay liya ki oliver ko uske thikaane waapas laayaa janaa chahie
 jab shri brownlo ne oliver ko kuch pustakon ke bhugtan ke liye baahar bheja to giroh kii nancy naam kii ek jawan ladki jisase oliver pehle mil chukaa tha, ne apane apmanjanak premi, bill cics naam kaa krur daaku, kii madad se use fansaa liya or oliver jaldi hi fegin kii maand main waapas aa gaya
 The thieves took from him a five-pound note which had been handed over to him by Mr
 Brownlow and kept a strip of his new clothes
 Oliver ran away frustrated and attempted to call for police assistance, but was mercilessly pulled back by Dodger, Charlie and Feagin
 tathaapi, nancy ke man main oliver ke prati sahanubhuti thi or usne use fegin or cics kii maar se bachaaya
 In an attempt to draw Oliver into a life of crime afresh, Fagin forces him to take part in the robbery
 nancy anichhaa se use bhartee karne main sahaayta karne lagi, magar vah use saath hi saath yah aashwashan bhi de rahi thi ki ho sakaa to vah uski sahaayta karegi
 sahyog nahin karne par jaan se maarane kii dhamkee dekar cics ne oliver ko ek choti si khidki se bheja or use saamne ke daravaaje ko analock karne kaa aadesh diya
 tathaapi dakaiti main galati ho jaati he or oliver ko goli lag jaati he
 After Sykes was released, the injured Oliver was looked after by the same people whom he had come to steal: Rose Mellie, her mentor Mrs Mellie and Harry Mellie
 After being convinced of Oliver's innocence, Rose took care of him so that he would be back healthy
 is bich monks naam ke ek rahasyamay vyakti ne fegin kaa pataa laga liya or oliver kii pratishtha ko nasht karne ke liye uske saath shadyantr karne laga
 monks ne oliver ko apradhi banane main hui vifaltaa ke liye fegin ko doshi tehraaya or un donon ne milakar ek yojana banaai jisase yah yakeen ho sake ki usne apane ateet ke bare main kuch pataa nahin kiya hai
 Monks is apparently related to Oliver in some way, although this is not mentioned until later
 oliver ke grihnagar main, shri bumbal ne sushri corne, kaaryshaala kii dhani matran, se shaadi kar lee jisase vah keval apni dukhi patni ke saath lagaataar hone vaali bahes se khud ko bachaa sake
 ek aisi hi bahes ke baad, shri bumbal ek din ek pub main gaye jahaan unki mulaakaat monks se hui jisane unhen oliver twist naam ke ek ladke ke bare main suchit kiya
 The two later arranged to bring back a locket and ring that belonged to Oliver's mother and dumped them in a nearby river
 Monks linked it to Feagin as part of the plot to destroy Oliver, but they were unaware that Nancy had overheard their conversation and that she had left to inform Oliver
 is samay nancy ko oliver apharan main apni bhoomika par shame aa rahi thi or ladke kii suraksha ke dar se vah roj meli or shri brownlo ko chetavanee dene nikal padi
 vah jaanati he ki monks or fegin ladke par kaabo karne ke liye phir se yojana bana rahe hai or oliver kii bhalaai se sambandhit vishay par kuch gupt baithken yojit kar rahe he
 One night Nancy tries to attend a meeting but Sykes does not give her permission because she does not tell him that she is actually being called
 fegin ko aisa ehsaas hua ki nancy kuch rahi he he or usne pataa lagane kii koshish kii ki aakhir uskaa rahasy kya he
 Meanwhile Noa Claypole Pratibutha left with Mr
 Sowerberry, stealing money from him and went to London
 charlot uske saath thi, ve ab ek rishte main bandha chuke hai
 Using the name "morris Bolter", he joined Feagin's gang for protection
 fegin ke saath noah pravaas ke dauraan, artphul doser chaandi sunghni ke ek bakse kii chori main pakadaa gaya, doshi paae jane par use australia bhej diya gaya
 Later, Feagin sends Noa to "dodge" Nancy and discover her secret: she secretly meets with Rose and Mr
 Brownlow to discuss how to save Oliver from Feagin and the Monks
 Fagin angrily gave this information to Sykes, he twisted the story in such a way as to appear as if Nancy had actually informed him
 Sykes is thought to be a traitor by Nancy and killed him angrily, and he accidentally dies himself as he runs away from the angry mob and crosses a roof
 monks ko shri brownlo ne majaboor kiya ki wo apana rahasy prakat kare: uskaa asli naam edward leford he or vah oliver kaa paitruk bhai he or haalanki vah vaid he par vah ek apriy shaadi kaa parinaam he
 Oliver's mother, Agnes, was his father's true love
 shri brownlo ke paas uski ek tasviir thi or usne tab poochtacha karnaa shuru kiya jab usne oliver or uske chehre ke bich ek chihnit saadrishy dekha
 monks ne apane pita ke bachche kii khoj main kai saal laga die- usase dosti karne ke liye nahin balki use nasht karne ke liye 
 brownlo ne oliver se uskaa aadha paitruk dhan monks ko dene ke liye poocha kyonki vah use ek doosraa mauka dena chahta tha; or oliver jo doosraa mauka dene ke liye pravan tha kushi se is baat kaa paalan kiya
 Monks then moved to the US where he spent his money in vain, committing crimes again and eventually died in prison
 fegin ko giraftaar kar liya gaya or faansee kii sajaa di gayi; ek bhaavnaatmak drishy main, oliver faansee kii purv sandhya par puraane pathbhrasht se milane newget bandhangrih jaataa he, 
 There was good news that Rose Mellie leaves Oliver's long-lost sister, Agnes, so she is Oliver's aunt
 vah apane lambey samay ke priy harry se shaadi karti he or oliver apane uddharak shri brownlo ke saath khushi se rahata he
 Noa becomes a paid semi-professional police informer
 bumbles apni naukari kho dete he jisase ant main udaar hatho ke saath sajaa vitarit kii ja sake
 spashtatah, usne dikhaaya he ki bill cics ko uske krur krityon ke liye ek bheed ne maut kii taraf khadeda or fegin ko dubak jane ke liye ninda kaksh main bheja or vahaan prakriya ke dwaara maut kii sajaa sunai
 kisi bhi charitra ko mochan praapt nahin hua; cics apane aparaadh se bhaagane kii koshish karata he or ghabaraaya hua fegin apane jivan kii aakhri raat ko rabbi dekhne yaa prarthana karne ke liye manaa kar detaa he, bajaay iske vah oliver ko bhaagane main madad karne ke liye kahata he
 In contrast, Nancy herself makes atonement at the cost of her own life and dies in a religious posture
 nancy bhi ubhaybhavita pradarshit karne ke liye oliver twist ke kuch patri main se ek he
 Although she is a complete criminal, trained and educated by Feagin since childhood, she has considerable empathy for repentance of her role in Oliver's kidnapping, and attempts to take steps to atone
 fegin ke peediton main se ek vah bhrasht he parantu naitik rup se abhi tak mari nahin he, vah us aadmi ke chote se aapraadhik samrajya kii bhayavahata ko suvaktaa aawaaj detii he
 She wants to save Oliver from a similar fate, at the same time she retreats from the idea of becoming a traitor, especially to Bill Sykes whom she loves
 jab baad main uski "chori, sadakon par foohad veshya" dene ke liye aalochana kii gayi thi, uske charitra kaa aisa gair jimmedaar badlaav, dikkence ne uske dil ke badlaav ko "ek sookhe acchhee tarah se ghaas se dabe strot ke neeche pani kii antim uchit boond" se varnit kiya he

 Also, around 70 percent of them live in Jalpaiguri district

 The entire region of the eastern and western dor, can be termed as the cradle land of Rabha
 rabha coach ke rup main khud ko dekhen or aitihaasik coach kingdom ke liye ek conection par jor he
 Ethnicity and language belong to the Indo Mongol group of people and as such Garos, Cacharis, Mechs, Kochs, Hajogs and Doras belong to Rabha
 zyaadaatar rup main bodo samooh ke anya sadasyon ke saath samanta he rabha ke rup main khud ko dekhen, lekin unamem se kuch aksar kocha ke rup main swayan kii ghoshnaa
 According to Dr
 Francis buchanan-hamilton, aspects of the socio-religious and material life of Rabha bear resemblance to those of pani-koch
 duusari ore i dalton, rabha kachaari jati kii shakhaaen hai or gaaro ke saath judaa hua he ki tark he
 According to Hodgson, the Rabhas belong to the Great Bodo or the Maquette water-coach and Rabha is of the same lineage and is not associated with the latter Garo
 ek plafere bhi rabha or gaaro ke bich kuch bhashaai or saanskrithik samanthaayen baahar bataaya gaya he
 He also said that there is a striking linguistic similarity between the Tog language and the Ragdaniya dialects that the commentary there
 is samay ke kuch bindu par ve ek duusare ke saath sampark main rahete the, ko lagata he ki use netritv kiya
 Rabhas of West Bengal and Assam generally speak the local Bengali and Assamese dialects
 van graamon main rahane vaale rabha kaaphi had tak unke mul rabha boli barkaraar rakhaa he
 Rabra Boli, George Abraham said that the assam-burmese branch of languages belongs to the Bodo
 arthvyavastha or samajasaamanya rup main rabha ke paramparaagat arthvyavastha, krishi, van aadhaarit gatividhiyon or bunai par aadhaarit he
 In the past, Rabha is used to practice farming transfer
 ve gogo yaa bill-hook ke saath jameen par kheti karne ke liye jari rakhaa
 Later they took up settled farming and started farming with plow
 kheti ke alaava, shikaar bhi rabha logon kii ek puraani pratha thi
 Bun Rabha was a traditional occupation of women
 ek baar jangal or vyavhaar badalata kheti main rahete the jo rabha, van simaaon kii kheti or simakan sthanantaran par pratibandh lagane, van vibhaag ke gathan ke baad se, aupniveshik shaskaon dwaara jangal main unke adhikaron se vanchit the
 Consequently, with the colonial land settlement system, most of the adopted displaced Rabha settled or took shelter in forest villages as plantation laborers
 aazaadee ke baad bharat sarkaar ne or adhik yaa kam rabha jaise samudaayon ke jangal main unke adhikaar hasil nahin kar sakaa he, jahaan van prabandhan, kaa ek hi aupniveshik pranali jari rakhaa
 Their number in white collar jobs will not be much though today, one finds Rabha in diverse occupations ranging from forest workers and farmers to all modern occupations like school teachers and government officials etc
 dharm or samskritirabha log paaramparik rup se kuch pashu anushthanon kaa abhyaas karenge
 However, today they more often follow a mixture of some Hindu and some animal rituals, which is a belief
 abhi bhi kisaan ke rup main gaanvon main rahete hai ki jangal ke gaanvon or rabha main rahane vaale van rabha ke bich puja paddatiyon main kaaphi matbhed hai
 Van Rabha follow traditional animal practices mixed with some rituals of mainstream Hinduism
 duusari ore gaanv par rabha ke rup main abhi tak unki dharmik prathaon kaa sambandh he sthaneey hinduon ke saath vilay kar diya he
 The religious world of the Rabha people is rife with various spirits and natural objects
 rabha ke mukhya devtaa rishi kaha jaataa he
 The sage, for Van Rabha as well as the village Rabha, is a male deity
 unhone yah bhi mahakaal ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Van Rabha worships her in all important social and religious rituals
 dukaan ke uttari kinare par rakhaa chaaval kii do mitti ke bartan ke pratinidhitiv vaale devataaon rugtuk or basek, vahaan rahe hai
 These two deities are considered as daughters of Rishi or Mahakal
 rugtuk or basek ghar ke devataaon or hindu devi lakshmi kii tarah dhan kii devi-devataaon ke rup main mana jaataa he
 Rugtuk and Basek inherit from the family heiress
 apane paaramparik pujari diosi, in devataaon kii neenv ke liye shubh din gina jaataa he
 The room where they are kept is occupied by the head of the family
 devataaon kisi bhi murtiyon ke liye nahin he
 a red colored clay pot filled with rice represents the deity Rugatuk
 ek anda ghade kii gardan par rakhaa jaataa he
 Like most tribal communities, dance and music play an important role in Rabha's life
 har rasm ke baad ve apane devataaon anugrahbhaajan karne ke liye vibhinn nrityon pradarshan karte hai
 Rabha most women can both sing and dance
 sabase janajaatiy nrityon kii tarah, rabha ke un kuch dainik krishi gatividhi se jude hai
 They have a unique dance style called "nakchug Reni" to celebrate fishing in the jungle drain
 sabhi umr ke rabha mahilaon ko is nrity puure dil main bhaag lete hai
 Today Hinduism and Christianity are two other major religious forces that have shaped the Rabha community
 isai dharm ke prabhaav shaayad adhik he
 In recent years Rabha has been educated through missionaries but has probably moved away from her indigenous culture and beliefs
 lekin uttar bengal rabha ke kuch ilaakon main abhi bhi jivan ke apane paaramparik tareekon se sangrakshit karne ke liye koshish kar rahe hai
 It is a struggle to maintain the centuries-old practices of their ancestors without turning away from the fruits of modernity
 keval samay hi uttar bengal ke adivasee garh main is saamaajik kayapalat-jagah lene ke parinaam ko prakat kar sakate hai
