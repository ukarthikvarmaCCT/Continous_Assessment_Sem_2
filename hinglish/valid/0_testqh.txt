 is prakaar saat kadam badhaaye jate hai
 Each mantra is spoken with each step
 pehla kadam ann ke liye, doosraa bal ke liye, teesraa dhan ke liye, chauthaa sukh keliye, paanchavaan parivaar ke liye, chhathvaan ritucharya ke liye or saatvaan mitrataa keliye uthaaya jaataa he
 After marriage, the husband and wife have to adopt seven programs together
 unamem donon kaa uchit or nyaay sangat yogadanrahe, isaki ruparekha saptapadi main nidharrit kii gayi he
 The first step is to increase food
 aahaar swasthyavardhak ho, ghar menchatorapen ko koi sthaan na mili
 What is prepared in the kitchen should be such that it serves the purpose of health care, even if it is not tasty
 ann kaa utpaadan,ann kii raksha, ann kaa sadupyog jo kar saktaa he, vahi safal grihasth he
 Taking too much, leaving the milk, keeping the pot open, wasting food grains, making a lot of spices, making it tamoguni, not taking care of hygiene, etc
 Even after spending a lot on diet, health is destroyed, so married life The responsibility of this is that proper care should be taken of the sattvikta of food
 doosraa kadam shaareerik or maansik bal kii vruddhi ke liye he
 Exercise, hard work, proper and regular dietary strength keeps the body stable
 adhyayan evamvichaar-vimarsh se manobal badhata he
 Efforts should be made to increase both types, both to be more capable, healthier and stronger - to think about its remedy
 teesraa kadam dhan kii vruddhi ke liye he
 Economy budget should be made and run
 apvyay main kani kaudi bhi nasht na hone paae
 Do not skimp on the appropriate tasks - do not spend money for fashion, addiction, bragging, etc
, and keep it safe for family upkeep
 uparjan ke liye pati-patni dononhi prayatan karen
 Men go out to do agriculture, business, jobs, etc
 Tostri earns this kind by sewing, washing, cleaning etc
 uparjanpar jitna dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he, kharch kii maryaadaaon kaa bhi vaisaa hi dhyaan rakhtehue ghar kii arthvyavastha sanbhaale rahanaa daampaty jivan kaa anivaary kattarvyahai
 The fourth step is to increase happiness
 vishram, manoranjan, vinod, haas-parihaaska aisa vaataavaran rakhaa jaae ki garibi main bhi amiri kaa anand mili
 Both should be happy
 muskaraane kii aadat daalen, hanste-hansaate jindagi kaaten
 Keep the mind light, adopt the policy of 'santoshi always happy'
 paanchavaan kadam parivaar paalan kaa he
 Be treated appropriately to everyone, small and big
 ashrith pashuon evam naukaron ko bhi parivaar mana jaae, is sabhi ashriton kisamuchit dekhbhaal, suraksha, unnati evam sukh-shaanti ke liye sadaa sochane or karnemen laaparvaahee na barti jaae
 The sixth step is of Ritucharya
 santanotpaadan ek swaabhaavik vritti he, isliedampaty jivan main uskaa bhi ek sthaan he, par us sambandh main mayaardaaon kapuri kathorta evam satarkta se paalan kiya jaae, kyonki asanyam ke kaaran dononke swasthya kaa sarvanaash hone kii ashanka rahati he, grihasth main rahakar bhibrahmacharya kaa samuchit paalan kiya jaae
 Both of them should also look at each other from the point of view of a friend, as far as possible the omniscient themes of sexuality should be kept
 santaan utpann karne se purv hajaar baar vichaar karen ki apnisthiti santaan ko susanskrit banane yogya he yaa nahin
 Carry the responsibility of creating children in that dignity
 saatvaan kadam mitrataa ko sthir rakhane evam badhaane ke liye he
 Both of them keep on thinking that there is no error from their side, due to which the partner has an opportunity to become angry or dissatisfied
 doosraa pakshakuch bhul bhi kar rahaa ho, to uskaa uttar kathorta, karkashta se nahin, varansajjanata, sahrudayata ke saath diya janaa chahie, taaki us mahanata se dabakar saathi koswatah hi sudharne kii antahprerana mili
 With outsiders, the policy of wickedness can be adopted to some extent with the wicked, but the lives of the souls should be used in the work of weapons like generosity, service, courtesy, forgiveness
 saptapadi main saat kadam badhaate hue in saat sutron ko hridyangam karnaa padataa he
 If these ideals and principles are adopted by the husband and wife and are determined to move forward to move on the same path, then there is no doubt in the success of married life
 var-vadhoo khadey hon
 Before taking each step, the Kamantra, which is the witness of the Dev Shaktis, is spoken, then the bride and groom should meditate with folded hands

 Slang or slang are informal words and phrases of a language or dialect that are not considered standard in the speaker's language or dialect but are acceptable in colloquialisms
 bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki kathboliyaan har maanak bhashaa main hameshaa astitv main rahi hai or lagbhag sabhi log unka prayog karte hai
 Often different sections of the same language community have their own different slang and the use of slang by a person is a sign of membership in a particular class
 udhaaharan ke liye dilli ke hindi bolne vaale pulisavaale ko kathboli main 'thulla' kehete hai jabaki mumbai main use 'mamaa' kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes slang can remain prevalent for a long time without being a part of the standard language, for example in some sections of the society in the form of slang the word 'thulla' for Sho or Durga in some communities in the Punjab region in 1880 Was found to be prevalent
 kathboliyaan aksar preyokti ke rup main bhi istemaal hoti hai jab kisi chiz ke liye maanak shabd sunne main apriy yaa apmanjanak samajha jaae, masalan 'mutr' ko kai hindibhashi kathboli main 'susu' kehete hai
 Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a word is part or slang of the standard language
 bhashavaigyanik bethani dumaas or jonethan liter ne kisi shabd yaa vaakyansh ke kathboli hone ke kuch chihnon kii suchi banaai ki agar koi shabd inamen se kam-se-kam do lakshan rakhata ho to shaayad kathboli he : Slang is different from a specialist dialect spoken in a commercial field
 vargboli kisi vishesh peshey kii takneekee shabdaawalee hoti he or uske shabd upar di gai suchi main se keval duusare maandand ko puraa karte hai, isliye kathboli nahin kahe ja sakate haalanki unka prayog peshey se baahar vaale ko samooh se alag rakhane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Some slang is used only in a particular area, for example in Fijian Hindi, 'what' is sometimes called 'konchi', a contracted form of 'who cheese'
 iske vipareet kathboli sangyaayen kshetra kii bajaae aksar kisi vishesh up-samskruti jaise ki sangeet yaa video khelon se judi hoti hai
 Nevertheless, slang expressions can go beyond their realms and be generally usable like "cool" and "jive"
 jabaki kuch shabd antat kathboli ke rup main apni sthiti ko kho dete hai, anya shabdon ke prayog ko zyaadaatar vaktaaon dwaara isi tarah mana jaataa rahaa
 When slang goes beyond the group or subculture that originally used it, its actual users tend to use other, less-recognized terms to retain the identity of the group
 kathboli kaa ek upyog saamaajik nishedhon ko darkinar karnaa he kyonki mukhyadhara kii bhashaa kuch vaastaviktaaon ko tarotaaja karne se dur bhaagane kii koshish karti he
 For this reason, slang terminology is particularly rich in certain areas such as violence, crime, drugs, and sex
 vaikalpik rup se kathboli varnan kii gayi chizon ke saath keval maatr apanepan se baahar nikal sakati he
 For example, among the gifts of Californian wine, Cabernet Sauvignon is often referred to as "cab saw", cardone as "card" and so on; This means that naming individual alcohols reduces its unnecessary use; It also helps to show the user's familiarity with alcohol
 yahan tak ki ek bhashaa vaale samudaay main bhi kathboli or jis had tak iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he, yah sampurna saamaajik, jaateey, aarthik or bhugolic kshetra main vyapak rup se bhinn ho jaataa he
 Slang can be out of use after a long time; However, sometimes its use becomes more and more common until it becomes an effective way of saying something, when it is generally understood as the accepted language of the mainstream, although the case of prohibitive words There may not be any expression that is considered mainstream or acceptable language
 kathboli ke kai shabd anaupchaarik mukhyadhara ke samvaad main or kabhi-kabhi aupchaarik samvaad main pravesh kar jate hai, haalanki isse arth yaa upyog main ek badlaav bhi shaamil ho saktaa he
 Slang often involves the creation of novel meanings for existing words
 un aupnyasik arthon kaa maanak arth se kaaphi had tak alag ho janaa ek aam baat he
 Thus both 'cool' and 'hot' can mean "very good," "impressive," or "beautiful"
 kathboli ke shabdon ko aksar keval ek gut yaa antah samooh ke andar istemaal ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Leats for example were originally popular only among certain Internet subcultures such as crackers and online video gamers
 haalanki 1990 ke dashak ke dauraan or 21veen sadi kii shuruyaat main lit ne internet par adhik se adhik aam sthaan lenaa shuru kar diya he or ab yah internet aadhaarit samvaad or baatcheet kii bhashaaon ke baahar bhi fail gaya he
 Other types of slang include the language of SMS used on mobile phones and "chatspeak," which is a reverse meaning of "laughing loudly" or "loud laughter" or ROFL, "rolling on the ground laughing" ), Which is widely used to send instant communication over the Internet
 kuch bhashavid kathboli ke prayog or khichdi bhashaa ke prayog ke bich ek antar rakhte hai
 According to Ghilad Zuckerman "slang refers to a specific social group, for example informal textual materials used by teenagers, soldiers, prisoners, and thieves
" kathboli bolchaal kii bhashaa kii tarah nahin he jo kisi avasar par vaktaa dwaara istemaal kii jane vaali ek anaupchaarik, aasaan boli he; jisamen shabdasancoch shaamil ho sakate hai jaise ki "tumhaara" or anya bolchaal ke shabdon kaa prayog
 aam bolchaal kii bhashaa kaa prayog anaupchaarik boli main istemaal kii jane vaali ek shabdic saamagree he jabaki vyapak arthon main "bolchaal kii bhashaa" shabdaawalee main kathboli kaa prayog shaamil ho saktaa he, iske sankeern arthon main nahin
 Slang is often used in colloquial language but not all colloquial languages are slang
 kathboli or bolchaal kii bhashaa ke bich karne kaa ek tarika yah poochna he ki kya zyaadaatar sthaneey vaktaa is shabd ko samajhate hai ; agar ve aisa karte hai to yah ek bolchaal kii bhashaa he
 The problem, however, is that it is not a separate, quantization system but a continuum system
 haalanki zyaadaatar kathboliyaan alpakaalik hoti hai or aksar nae logon dwaara prayog kii jaati hai jinamein se kuch gaiyr-kathboli vaali bolchaal kii bhashaa kii sthiti hasil kar leti hai 'anand, bhagya' or ek yahudee mahila kaa pehla naam, zelda) or yahan tak ki ek aupchaarik sthiti "

 Although Alauddin accepted the title of 'yamin-ul-khilafat-nasiri-amir-ul-mominin' in recognition of the authority of the Caliphate, he did not think it necessary to take his post from the Caliph
 ulema varg ko bhi apane shashan kaary main hastkshep nahin karne diya
 He considered the interest of the state as paramount, not giving prominence to the principles of the religion of Islam in governance
 allaudin kilji ke samay nirankushta apane charam seemaa par pahunch gayi

 The third rebellion was fought by Alauddin's sister's sons Malik Omar and Mangu Khan, but both of them were defeated and killed
 chauthaa vidroh dilli ke haji maula dwaara kiya gaya, jiskaa daman sarkaar hamiddin ne kiya
 Thus all these rebellions were successfully suppressed
 allaudin ne turk amiron dwaara kiye jane vaale vidroh ke kaarnon kaa adhyayan kar un kaarnon ko samaapt karne ke liye 4 adhyadesh jari kiye
 Under the first ordinance, Alauddin confiscated the land given to the rich in the form of donations, gifts and pensions and imposed a right of tax on him, due to which he lacked funds

 Under the third ordinance, Alauddin Khilji banned alcohol, cannabis and gambling
 chauthe adhyadesh ke antargat allaudin ne amiron ke aapas main mail-jol, saarvajanik samarohon evam vaivaahik sambandhon par pratibandh laga diya
 These four ordinances brought by the Sultan were completely successful

 Ranthambore ruler Hammir Dev was famous for his ability and courage
 allaudin ke liye ranthambhore ko jeetna isliye bhi aavashyak tha, kyonki hammirdev ne vidrohi mongol netaa mohammad shah evam kehab ko apane yahan sharan de rakhi thi, isliye bhi allaudin ranthambhore ko jeetna chahta tha
 Hence, in July 1301 AD, Alauddin took the fortress of Ranthambore into his possession
 hammirdev veergati ko praapt hue
 Alauddin killed Ranmal and his companions, who met Hammirdev by betraying him
 ‘tarikh-e-alaai’ evam ‘hammir mahakavy’ main hammirdev or unke parivaar ke logon kaa johar dwaara mrityu praapt hone kaa varnan he

 hammir raso ke anusaar hammir kii rani rangade ke netritv main rajput mahilao ne johar kiya tathaa rajkumaari deval de ne padmala talab main kudakar jal johar kiya tha
 The ruler of Mewar was Rana Ratan Singh, whose capital was Chittor
 chittod kaa qila samrik drushtikon se bahut surakshit sthaan par bana hua tha
 Therefore this fort was in the eyes of Alauddin
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne amir khusarav ke rani shiba or suleman ke prem prasang ke ullekh aadhaar par or 'padmavat kii katha' ke aadhaar par chittod par na ke akraman kaa kaaran rani padmini ke anupan soundarya ke prati uske aakarshan ko tehraaya he

 He named Chittor after 'khizr Khan' and returned to Delhi by handing it over to Khizr Khan

 Thus with the authority over Jalore, the difficult task of Alauddin's Rajasthan victory was completed

 gulabjika kavy-sansar bahut vishaal he
 Now there is a need that separate research should be done on his Ghazal literature, Geeti-poetry, Prabandha-poetry, contextualism, Chhandavidhan, Bhasha-pyaay, Natya-literature, novel experiment etc
 only then justice can be done to him

 ve mahaamanaa madan mohan malviya dwaara sthapit bharti parishad ke bhi adhyaksh rah chuke the
 Gulabji continued to enrich Bharti's stock with his original origins
 unhone apana lakshya yahi nirdhaarit kiya-"gandh banakar hawa main bikhar jaayan hammeos banakar pankhuriyon se jhar jaayan hamatu na dekhe hamen baag main bhi to kyatera aangan to khushboo se bhar jaayan ham sahitya ke kshetra main gulabji ke avdaan ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 unka yah avdaan do prakaar kaa he
 Not only has he composed excellent literature, but has also left trails for generations to come
 ve kavy kii anek vidhaon ke pratham praneta rahe hai jinka sankshep main ullekh is prakaar he - Doha is a very old verse, but in modern Hindi, the couplets of Shringar like Bihari and Virus like Dingle poet Suryamall were first presented by Gulabji
 a high degree of emotionality and language tension and fluency are a sign of the poet's power
 gulabji ne angrezi ke sonet rup kaa hindi main pratham baar 1941 main prayog kiya
 Unknown people named Trilochan Shastri the promoter of sonnet
 No one even tried to open the book of Shastriji to see how long after Gulabji's book was printed and whether those who are being called sonnets meet the test of sonnet or not
 Sonnet is not just a verse, but a mode of expression
 keval chaudaa panktiyon kii kavita sonet nahin ho jaati, panktiyon main vishesh prakaar se tukant kaa nirvaah tathaa antim do panktiyon main bhav kaa samaahaar bhi hona chaiye
 trilochan shastri kii kavita main in donon pramukh lakshanon kaa abhaav hone se ve sonet the hi nahin
 gulabji ne sonet ko itnaa saadh liya tha ki gandhiji ke dehavsaan ke samachar se marmaahat hokar do raaton main 46 soneton kii rachana kar daali jo avikal rup se ’gandhi-bharti’ ke naam se chape
 yadhyapi unka sonet ko diya gaya hindi naam ’swanubhuti’ prachlit nahin ho paaya par sonet sadaa unke liye abhivyakti kaa swaabhaavik prakaar rahaa
 Nowadays he is writing poetry, od and sonnet in English
 gulabji ne hindi gazalon kaa sarvapratham 1971 main pravartan kiya
 Thus, efforts were made to convert it into Hindi for a long time
 kintu urdu kii baharon ko hindi bhashaa main utaar lene bhar se hindi ghazal nahin ban jaati, hindi kii pratik yojana, bimb-vidhaan, aadharbhoot darshan ko bhi isamen goonthna aavashyak tha
 Gulabji reconciled this balance and brought the soul of Urdu along with Hindi language into Ghazal
 Just as the Chhayawadi poets gave Hindi-literature, new phraseology, new dimensions of expression, subtlety of sentiments, similarly Gulabji expanded the new possibilities in Hindi by using his ghazals
 aaj ghazal hindi kii ek prachlit vidha he tathaa iskaa kaafii shrey bharti ke is mook sadhak ko jaataa he
 Three out of four books of ghazals written by Gulabji were awarded by the Uttar Pradesh government
 In this way Gulabji not only enriched literature by writing ghazals in Hindi but also paved the way for the next ghazals
 sabhi chhayavaadi kaviyon ne sundar geet likhe par tatsamabahul shabd-vinyas tathaa viviyata, aspashtataa tathaa ekanviti kaa abhaav aadi chhayavaadi dosha se aachchann in geeton ke taar na to lok-maanas se jud sake na gayan se
 ye saahitiyik geet keval kavita kii ek style ke rup main hi grahya ho paye
 gayan ke liye ab bhi madhyayugin geeton kaa sahaara lenaa padataa tha
 Inspired by this, Gulabji tried to reestablish the tradition of lyrical songs
 inke bhakthi-geeton ke sangrah ’bhakthi-ganga’ tathaa ’tilak karen raghubir’ kaa udghaatan 1997 main mananeey raashtrapati shri shankaradayal sharma ke kar-kamalon dwaara hua tha
 The language of these songs is simple, emotion intensive and philosophy intensive
 inamen geyata ke saath hi vishisht tathaa saamaanya - donon janon ko lubhaane kii kshamta he
 Numerous songs have attested to the significance of Gulabji's use of music
 ’geet-brindavan’, sita-banavaas’, tathaa ’geet-ratnavali’- in teen pustakon main gulabji ne katha ke taratamya ko gey geeton main is prakaar bandha he ki unhen manch par geeti-natya athwa nrity-natya ke rup main bhi prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus, these three books are also arrangements, also free ones; There are visuals and also audio, text and also lyrical
 Many of his songs have been sung and praised and many have also been performed on stage with dance
 in geeton main krishna, radha, sita tathaa ratnavali ke charitron ko bhi naye rup main darshaya gaya he
 'bali-nirvas' is a rare example of Mishra poetry or geeti-natya
 isane parvarti sahitya ko kaafii prabhavit kiya he
 Apsara incident of this composition long before 'urvashi' of 'dinkar' is visible
 inke atirikt masanvi, od, gaderiye ke geet, pratik-kavy aadi vidhaon kaa safal prayog kiya
 Now the question is, what stream of literature, what trend do they represent, then the poet who has worshiped poetry for almost 70 years cannot be expected that he will do only one type of poetry
 We also get to see different forms of Gulabji
 ve prabandhkaar hai to gazalkaar or geetkaar bhi; chhandabaddh kavy main siddhhast hai to chhandamukt kavy tathaa hiku main bhi utana hi adhikaar rakhte hai
 In the world divided in camps, Gulabji never walked with the flow, never resorted to any faction or suit
 unhone sadaiv nutan prayog kiye hai tathaa sadaa pragati ke path par agrasar rahane se ve sachche arthon main pragativaadee hai
 According to Purti Mishra, "since 1940, hardly anyone would be a reader, editor or reviewer of Hindi literature who did not discuss or admire the wonderful literary legend Shri Gulab Khandelwal
" In the words of Acharya Vishwanath Singh - "mahakavi Gulab Khandelwal is a pioneer in the line of first-class litterateurs to flow the astral Mandakini of literature
 pichley chah-saat dashakon se prayag, dilli, bombai, kolkata, madras, bharat, america or canada aadi deshon ke saahitiyik-saanskrithik jivan ko gulabji apni saraswat-sadhana se gaurav-mandit kar rahe hai
 He has inaugurated new horizons in various genres of poetry with the innovation of his selfless talent
 unki prayek pustak kavy main kisi na kisi naveen vidha kii sthapana karti he
 Be it songs of free spirit and love of nature and love, or strong and flowing couplets and sonnets, inspired by patriotism, ghazals, rubies and freedoms from the poignant sensations of life, or Khandakavya, epic and poetic in the depths of the life-gems - the genius of Gulabji Researching new dimensions of poetry continues
 ghazal jaisi urdu kii manji hui vidha main unhone hindi ke sweekrut soundaryabodh kaa abhinivesh karke sanyam or suruchi kii vruttarekha ke bheetar maarmik anubhutiyon kii uplabdhi kii he
 His 'sau Gulab Khile' is the first compilation of Hindi-known level ghazals
 iske baad unhone ’pankhuriyaan gulab kii’, ’kuch or gulab’, ’har subah ek taaja gulab’ jaisi anya kritiyon main 365 gazalen likhakar is prayog ko purnataa tak pahunchaa diya he
 While beginning his journey through the romantic aesthetic of adolescent life, his practice has been centered in the light of eternal life-values, while his art has provided a new strength to the accepted expression system of cinematography with original imagery and varied verses
 pratibha ke satva or abhivyanjana kii samruddhi ke vichaar se chhayavaad ke kavi-chatushtay ke baad, gulabji hindi ke sabase mahatvapurn kavi hai
 
 
 
 With his literary work Gulabji has earned fame not only in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Rajasthan and remote Kerala
 sudhi vidvatsamaj se lekar saadhaaran sahitya-premiyon tak unke geet or gazalen akashwani se prasaarit or sugam sangeetkaaron dwaara prachaarit hokar janata kaa kanthhaar ho rahi hai; gulabji kii gazalon main kavy ke vyanjan ke saath jo sangeet kaa swar he tathaa unke geeton main jo sahajata he vah aajkal kii pathya-apathya hindi kavita ko kavy kii shravyata pradaan karne kaa safal saadhan he
 Uttar pradesh-sarkar has honored the poet as well as sahitya-sadhana by rewarding his six compositions - Usha, Roop Dhoop, Hundred Gulab Khile, a few more roses, a fresh rose and Ahalya every morning
 
 
 
 pichley do dashakon main unhone na keval chhandamukt rachana ke vividh prayog hi kiye hai, tulsi, sur, mira kii bhakthigiton kii dhara main praayah ek sahasr geeton kaa srijan karke sahitya se sangeet ko punah jodne kaa mahaan kaary bhi sampadit kiya he
 Apart from this, Gulabji has also presented the tragedy of Radha, Sita and Ratnavali's life in a new perspective by composing lyrical poems like 'geet-vrindavan', 'sita-vanvas' and 'geet-ratnavali'
 idhar kii hi likhi hui urdu masanvi kii style main unki naveen rachana, ’preet na kario koy’, hindi ke kavy-sahitya main ek nayaa aayam jodatii he
 While by this composition he has come under the category of Urdu's leading masnavi-writers, Mir Hasan and Dayashankar 'nasim', while through his long series of devotional songs, he has secured his place in the tradition of Kabir, Sur, Tulsi and Meera
 " Mahadevi Varma once expressed regret, "hindi people did not do justice to you!" Listening to his poetry, she said, "there were pictures coming in front of my eyes one by one
 " spashtatah unka sanket gulabji ke kavy kii bimbaatmakataa kii ore tha

 If it has one independent variable and one independent variable, then the relation is called simple differential equation
 jab paratantr chal to ek parantu swatantra char anek hon to paratantr char ke khandawkal gunak hote hai
 When they are present, the relation is called partial differential equation
 paratantr char ko swatantra char ke pardo main vyanjit karne ko avakal sameekaran kaa hal karnaa kaha jaataa he
 If the differential equation has a differential coefficient of the nth standard and not more, then the differential equation is called the nth grade

 Suppose u is an unknown function of variable amount x and both c and ज्ञात are known constants
 In the next group of examples, the unknown function u depends on two variables x and t or x and y
 One can classify differential equations in several ways - kuch avakal samikarnon ko vaishleshik reeti se hal kar sakate hai
 But the solution of differential equations in numerical way is very important because one can solve all the equations from it and secondly that in modern times computer is ubiquitous and unavoidable
 neeche avakal sameekaran ke hal kii kuch vaishleshik vidhiyaan di gayin hai- Let the following differential equation be given
 d y d x = f { \ displaystyle {dy \ over dx}=f} yadi iskaa daanyaa paksh do falnon ke gunanfal ke baraabar ho jisamen ek falan keval x kaa falan ho or doosraa keval y kaa
 That is, dydx = gh, { \ displaystyle {dy \ over dx} = gh,} when this happens, one can write the equation in such a way that it has only x and dx on one side and y and dy on the other side
 nimnlikhit udhaaharan dekhiye- Solve dy - ydx = 0 { \ displaystyle dy-ydx = 0}
 hal: is sameekaran ko is prakaar likhaa ja saktaa he d y y = d x { \ displaystyle {dy \ over y}={dx \ over }} , ∫ dyy = ∫ dx { \ displaystyle \ int {dy \ over y} = \ int {dx \ over}} l n | y | = l n | x + 1 | + c { \ displaystyle ln|y|=ln|x+1|+c} y = eln | x + 1 | + c = eln | x + 1 | 
 ec { \ displaystyle y = e ^ {ln | x + 1 | + c} = e ^ {ln | x + 1 |}

 It is mentioned many times in the Markandeya Purana as the ascetic place of 88000 sages
 vaayu puranantargat magh mahatmaya tathaa brihaddharmpurana, purv-bhaag ke anusaar iske kisi gupt sthal main aaj bhi rishiyon kaa swadhyayanushthan chalata he
 Sauti Ugrashrawa, the son of Lomhadisha, narrated mythology to the sages here
 varah puraana ke anusaar yahaan bhagwaan dwaara nimish maatr main daanvon kaa sanhaar hone se yah 'naimisharany' kahalaaya
 According to the Puranas like Vayu, Koorm etc
 the name of Manomaya Chakra of God was here, so it is called Naimisharanya
 'naimish' kii vyutpatti 'nimish' shabd se bataai jaati he, kyonki gaurmukh ne ek nimish main asuron kii sena kaa sanhaar kiya tha 
 According to another observation, it got its name Naimish due to the high amount of fruit blinking found at this place
 vyutpatti ke vishay main teesraa mat he ki asuron ke dalan ke avasar par vishnu ke chakra kii nimi naimish main giri thi 
 But according to another legend, when the party of the gods arrived under the leadership of Mahadev suffering from the terror of the demons of Brahma, Brahma left his chakra and guided him to the place where the chakra fell
 naimish main chakra gira at: vah sthal aaj bhi chakratirtha ke naam se prasiddh he
 Chakratirtha is hexagonal

 The earliest mention of Naimisharanya is found in the wreath of Valmiki Ramayana
 pushpika main ullekh he ki lav or kush ne gomti nadi ke kinare ram ke ashwamedh yajna main saat dinon main valmiki rachit kavy kaa gayan kiya
 Maharishi Shaunak had a desire to have a long knowledge session
 unki aradhana se prasann hokar brahmaji ne unhen ek chakra diya or kaha- `ise chalaate hue chale jaao
 Where the 'name' of this cycle falls, consider the same place to be holy and make a ashram there and do a knowledge session

 They all started roaming that cycle and started wandering in India
 gomti nadi ke kinare ek tapovana main chakra kii nemi gir gayi or vahi vah chakra bhoomi main pravesh kar gaya
 With the falling of the cycle, that shrine was called Naimish
 jahaan chakra bhoomi main pravesh kar gaya, vah sthaan chakratirtha kaha jaataa he
 This shrine is on the left bank of the Gomti River and is considered one of the 51 ancestral places
 yahaan somavati amavasya ko mela lagata he
 In this pilgrimage to Shaunakji, Sutji narrated the story of eighteen Puranas
 dwapar main shribalramji yahaan padhaare the
 By accident, the throttle thread died by him

 yahaan ke pramukh tirthon main: Arju is a 1950 Hindi-language film
 isamen anya saathi kalakaaro ke saath hindi nayak dilip kumaar ne bhumika nibhaai thi
 Arju on Internet Movie Database byaaj ek aisa shulk he jo udhaar lee gayi sampatti ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It is the price paid for the money borrowed, or, the money earned from the deposit
 jin sampattiyon ko byaaj ke saath udhaar diya jaataa he unamem shaamil hai dhan, share, kiraye par kharid dwaara upabhokta vasteen, pramukh sampattiyaan jaise vimaan or kabhi-kabhi vitt patta vyavastha par diya gaya puraa kaarkaana
 byaaj kii gananaa parisampattiyon ke mulya par thik usee prakaar kii jaati he jaise paise par
 Interest can also be seen as a "rent of money"
 jab dhan ko bank main jamaa kiya jaataa he, to jamakarta ko aamtaur par jamaa kii gai raashi ke ek pratishat ke hisaab se byaaj kaa bhugtan kiya jaataa he; jab paisa udhaar liya jaataa he, to aamtaur par rindaata ko bakaayaa raashi ke ek pratishat ke hisaab se byaaj kaa bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 The percentage of principal money which is paid over a fixed period as a fee is called the interest rate
 byaaj, rindaata ke liye ek muaavja hota he jo use, k) mul dhan ke jokhim ke liye diya jaataa he jise rin jokhim kaha jaataa he; or kha) anya upyogi nivesh ko chhod dene ke liye diya jaataa he jise udhaar di gayi sampatti dwaara kiya ja saktaa tha
 These omitted investments are known as opportunity costs
 rindaata ke swayan pratyaksh rup se is sampatti kaa upyog karne ke bajaae, use rin lene vaale ko de diya jaataa he
 That borrower then enjoys his utility by overtaking the effort required to acquire that property, while the lender enjoys the benefit of the fee paid by the borrower for that privilege
 arthshaastra main, byaaj ko rin kaa mulya mana jaataa he
 In ancient Israel of biblical times, levying interest on private debt was against the law of Moses
 madhya kaal ke dauraan, samay ko ishwar kii sampatti mana jaataa tha
 Therefore, demanding interest was treated as trading with God's property
 iske alaava, saint thomas equinas, jo catholic carch ke pramukh thiologian the, ne yah tark diya ki byaaj kii maang karnaa galat he kyonki yah "dugane prabhaar" ke baraabar he kyonki isamen vastu or uske istemaal donon ke liye prabhaar lagaaya jaataa he
 The Church referred to this as a sin of usury; This rule was never strictly followed and gradually it came to an end which completely disappeared during the Industrial Revolution
 soodakhori ko roman catholic carch dwaara hameshaa hi nakaaratmak drushti se dekha gaya
 The Second Latheran Council condemned the payment of any additional money in excess of the principal money lent, the Vienna Council expressly prohibited usury and declared that any law tolerant of usury would be heretical and the first intellectuals
 Denied taking interest
 In the medieval economy, loans were entirely the result of necessities and, under these circumstances, interest was considered morally bad
 ise naitik rup se sandigdh bhi mana jaataa tha, kyonki paisa udhaar de kar koi maal utpaadit nahin kiya jaataa tha or isliye iskaa koi muaavja nahin hona chahie, jo anya gatividhiyon ke vipareet tha jisamen pratyaksh shaareerik parinaam hote the jaise ki lohaar kaa kaam yaa kheti
 As Jewish citizens were excluded from most occupations by local rulers, churches, and guilds, they were forced to accept socially inferior frontier occupations such as taxes and rents and give loans
 lendaaron or dendaaron ke bich prakritik tanaav saamaajik, raajnneetik, dharmik, aarthik upabhedon ke saath jud gaye
 


 Financial persecution of Jews occurred more in areas where they were most disliked and if Jews reacted by focusing on lending to non-jews, their unpopularity - as well as pressure on them - would have increased
 is prakaar yahudee ek dushchakr kaa mohara ban gaye
 On the basis of biblical rules, Christians were completely condemned to take interest, and from 1179 those who did so were excommunicated
 catholic swechhachari shaasha aksar yahudiyon par sakht se sakht vittiya boj daalaa karte the
 The Jews reacted to a trade in which Christian law actually favored them, and they made a mark in the loathsome trade of lending
 islamic sabhyataa main bhi praayah byaaj ko unheen kaarnon se bura mana jaataa he jinke kaaran catholic carch ke dwaara soodakhori ko nishiddh mana jaataa he, adhikansh vidwaan is baat se sahamat hai ki quran main byaaj maangane kii spashtatya manaahi he
 Therefore medieval jurists developed many financial instruments to encourage lending with responsibility
 punarjagran yug main, logon kii badhati gatishiltaa ne vaanijya or udhyamiyon ke liye nae laabhpurn kaarobaar ko shuru karne ke liye upyukt paristhitiyon main vruddhi ko sambhav banaaya
 After it became clear that the money borrowed was no longer solely for consumption, but also for production, interest was no longer considered bad
 di skool of saalamanaka ne un vibhinn kaarnon ko vistrut rup se samajhaayaa he jo byaaj lene ko uchit tehraate he: jo vyakti rin praapt karata he usko laabh hota he or vyakti bhugtan kiye gaye byaaj ko ek kist ke rup main dekh saktaa he jo rin pradaata dwaara uthaaye gaye jokhim ke liye chukaaya jaataa he
 There was also a question of opportunity cost, in which the lending party lost the possibility of using the lent money
 antat or shaayad sabase mul rup main swayan paise ko hi maal ke rup main or kisi ke dhan ke istemaal ko kisi aisi vastu ke rup main dekha jane laga jiske liye use byaaj ke rup main laabh praapt hona chahie
 Martin de Azpilcueta also acknowledged the influence of time
 On being equal to other things, any person would prefer to receive his given item now instead of future
 This preference indicates more values
 is siddhant ke tahat, byaaj, us avadhi ke liye bhugtan he jiske dauraan rin daata ko apane dhan se vanchit rahanaa padataa he
 Economically, the value of principal money is called the interest rate and is based on the supply and demand rules of money supply
 byaaj dar ko dhan aapurti main herpher ke madhyam se niyantrit karne kaa sabase pehla prayaas 1847 main french central bank dwaara kiya gaya
 The first formal study on interest rates and their effects on society was conducted by Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, and Mirabeau during the emergence of excellent economic thinking

 Since then several perspectives have arisen on the nature and impact of interest rates

 Some countries, including Iran, Sudan and Pakistan, have taken steps to completely eradicate interest from their financial system
 Instead of interest, the interest-free lender imposes a "fee" to provide lending services
 jaisaa ki is tarah kaa shulk ganitiya rup se ek byaaj lagane ke jaisaa hi he, isliye "byaaj mukt" banking or "byaaj ke liye" banking ke bich kaa antar kareeb ek hi baat he
 Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, or on the portion of principal that has not yet been paid
 saadhaaran byaaj kii raashi kii gananaa nimnlikhit formule ke anusaar kii jaati he: Where r is the interest rate term B0 is the initial balance and m is the number of periods that have passed
 avadhi byaaj dar r kii gananaa karne ke liye, vyakti byaaj dar ko / avadhi sankhya m se vibhajit karata he
 For example, imagine that a credit card holder has an outstanding deposit of $ 2500 and the simple interest rate is 12
99% per year
 3 maah kii samaapti par joda gaya byaaj hoga, And he will have to pay $ 2581
19 at this time to pay the balance in full
 yadi iske bajaay vah keval byaaj kaa bhugtan karata he to bhugtan avadhi dar r ke anusaar un teen maheene main se prayek maheene kii, byaaj bhugtan kii raashi hogi, At the end of 3 months, his balance will still be $ 2500

 sthir bhugtanon par atirikt laagat hoti he jise rin kii tulana karte samay dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak hota he
 For example, a given $ 100 principal amount: vibhinn byaaj yukt ofron kii tulana karte samay do jatiltaayen shaamil he
 It is not possible to withdraw money from a bank account that provides only simple interest, as it is beneficial to withdraw money from it and then deposit it immediately
 chakravriddhi byaaj, saadhaaran byaaj ke samaan hota he, lekin samay ke saath inkaa antar kaaphi gaharaa hota jaataa he
 This difference is because the outstanding interest is added to the outstanding balance
 ise duusare tareeke se pesh kiya jaae to, udhaarkarta par pichley byaaj par byaaj lagaaya jaataa he
 Assuming that no part of the principal or subsequent interest has been paid, the loan is calculated by the following formulas: jahaan Icomp chakravriddhi byaaj he, B0 praarambhik bakaayaa raashi he, Bm, m avadhi ke baad kii bakaayaa raashi he or r avadhi dar he
 For example, if the above credit card holder chooses not to make any payment, the interest will continue to accrue
 to, 3 maheene ke ant main credit card dharak kii bakaayaa raashi 2582
07 dollar ho jaaegi or ab use aarambhik bakaayaa raashi tak waapas len ke liye use 82
07 dollar kaa bhugtan karnaa hoga
 In the short term, simple interest is almost the same as compound interest, so regular payments are the least expensive repayment strategy
 chakravriddhi byaaj ke saath ek samasya yah he ki iske parinamswaroop aane vaale daayitv kii vyakhya karnaa mushkil he
 To simplify this problem, a common rule in economics is to disclose the interest rate by assuming the period to be one year, with compounded interest compounding annually
 haalanki, rin dene main byaaj dar aksar maamuli byaaj dar ke rup main uddhrut kiya jaataa he 
 Loans often also include various non-interest fees and fees
 ek udhaaharan he sanyukt rajya america ke bandhak rinon par point
 jab is tarah kii fees maujuud hoti he, to udhaardaataaon ko niyamit rup se vitt ke 'asli' mulya ke vishay main soochna dena aavashyak hota he, jo praayah vaarshik pratishat dar ke rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 APR attempts to express the total cost of a loan as an interest rate after adding additional fees and expenses, although the details may vary by jurisdiction
 arthshaastra main, nirantar chakravriddhi kaa istemaal praayah ganitiya gun ke kaaran kiya jaataa he
 Commercial loans usually use simple interest, but it is not necessary that they always have a single interest rate until the end of the loan term
 rin jiske liye byaaj dar nahin badalata he use nirdhaarit dar rin kaha jaataa he
 During the loan term, the loan may have a variable rate based on a reference rate, usually higher than a fixed margin
 These are known as variable rate, variable rate or adjustable rate
 nirdhaarit dar or asthir dar rin kaa sangyojan sambhav hota he or aksar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Loans can also have different interest rates during the loan period, where the change in interest rate is controlled based on specific parameters other than an underlying interest rate
 udhaaharan ke liye ek rin jo daron main vishisht parivartan ko adhidisht karne ke liye ek vishisht samyavadhi kaa prayog karata he, jaise pratham varsh main 5% kaa ek dar, dwitiya varsh main 6% kaa ek dar, tisare varsh main 7% kaa ek dar
 In economics, interest is considered the value of debt, therefore, it is also subject to distortions due to inflation
 maamuli byaaj dar hi upabhokta ko nazar aati he,, jo mudrasphiti ke liye samaayojan karne se pehle kii keemat ko sanderbhit karata he
 Marginal interest is made up of real interest rate plus inflation, among other factors
 ek maamuli byaaj ke liye ek saral formula he: i = r + π { \ displaystyle i = r + \ pi} jahaan i maamuli byaaj he, r vaastavik byaaj he or π { \ displaystyle \ pi } mudrasphiti he
 This formula attempts to measure the value of interest in units of constant purchasing power
 haalanki, agar yah bayaan sahi he, to isamen kam se kam do bhrant dharna hogi
 First, that all interest rates within a region that share the same inflation must be the same
 duusare, ki udhaardaataaon ko us avadhi kii mudrasphiti kaa pataa hota he jis samay ve rin dete hai
 One reason for the disparity between the interest earned on bond bonds and the interest earned on mortgage loans is the risk that a lender incurs due to lending to an economic agent
 is vishesh maamle main, ek vyaktigat naagarik se adhik ek sarkaar ke bhugtan karne kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Therefore, the rate of interest charge charged on an individual citizen is higher than the rate of interest charged to the government
 upar ullikhit jaankaree vishmata ko vichaar ke antargat lene ke liye, mudrasphiti kaa mulya or paise kii asli keemat, donon ko hi unke apekshit mulya main parivartit kar diya jaataa he jisase nimnlikhit sameekaran falit hota he: it = r + π + σ { \ displaystyle i_ {t} = r _ {} + \ pi _ {} + \ sigma} yahaan, i t { \ displaystyle i_{t}} rin ke samay par nunatam byaaj tha, r { \ displaystyle r_{}} vaastavik byaaj he jo rin kii avadhi ke dauraan apekshit tha, π { \ displaystyle \ pi _{}} mudrasphiti he jo rin kii avadhi ke dauraan apekshit he or σ { \ displaystyle \ sigma } sanchaalan main lage jokhim ke liye pratinidhi mulya he
 The calculation for cumulative interest is -1
 It ignores the 'per year' rule and makes assumptions on each payment date
 yah aam taur par do lambii avadhi ke avasar kii tulana karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he

 The inclusive sum of numbers 1 to 12 is seventy-eight
 yah abhyaas computer ke avishkaar se pehle ke dinon main byaaj kii twarit gananaa ko sakasham banaata tha
 In a loan in which interest is calculated according to the rule of 78s, the total interest over the life of the loan is calculated as either simple or compound interest and is equal to one of the above methods
 rin ke jivan kaal ke dauraan bhugtan sthir rahata he; lekin bhugtan ko uttarottar choti maatra main byaaj main aavantit kar diya jaataa he
 In a one-year loan, in the first month, 12 / 78 of all outstanding interest is owed during the life of the loan; In the second month, 11 / 78; And by the twelfth month only 1 / 78 of all interest remains outstanding
 78s ke niyam kaa vyaavhaarik prabhaav yah he ki avadhi rinon ke bhugtan ke samay purv bhugtan ko adhik mahangaa bana diya gaya
 For a one-year loan, approximately 3 / 4 of all payments due are collected by the sixth month and then the full payment of the principal amount exceeds the effective interest rate AYP used to calculate the payment
 goes
 1992 main, sanyukt rajya america ne "78s ke niyam" byaaj ke upyog ko paanch varshon se adhik kii avadhi vaale bandhak punarvitt or anya upabhokta rinon ke silsile main pratibandhit kar diya
 Some other courts have also outlawed the use of the rule of 78s in certain types of loans, especially in consumer loans
 72 kaa niyam: "72 kaa niyam" yah pataa lagane kii ek "twarit or gandi" vidhi he ki ek die hue byaaj dar main dhan kitni jaldi doguna hota he
 For example, if you have an interest rate of 6%, then combining at 6% will take 72 / 6 or 12 years to double your money
 yah ek sanniktan he jo 10% se adhik hone par tuutane lagata he
 Investments are the market for fixed interest rates
 Each specific loan takes into account the following factors in determining its interest rate: isamen ve sabhi upyog shaamil hai jisamen us dhan ko lagaaya ja saktaa tha, jisamen shaamil he dusron ko udhaar dena, anyatra nivesh karnaa, nakad rakhana or keval dhan ko kharch karne ke liye
 As the lender defers its consumption, it would at least want the money it recovers to be sufficient to account for the increased prices of goods due to inflation
 chunki bhavishya kii mudrasphiti agyaat hoti he, yahaan teen ranneetiyaan hai
 There is always the risk of the borrower going bankrupt, absconding or otherwise defaulting on the loan
 jokhim premium udhaarkarta kii akhandta ko, uske udhyam ke safal hone main jokhim ko or kisi bhi samparshvik jis par vachan diya gaya ho kii suraksha ko, maapne kaa prayaas karata he
 For example, loans to developing countries involve a much higher risk premium than the US government due to differences in their credit worthiness
 ek kaarobaar kii parichaalan rin seemaa kaa dar ek bandhak rin ke dar kii tulana main adhik hoga
 The credit worthiness of the business is measured by bond rating services and the individual's credit score is measured by bureau credit
 ek vyakti ke rin ke jokhim main bade paimaane par maanak main parivartan sambhav he
 The lender would like to secure its maximum risk, but lenders with a portfolio of loans can reduce the risk premium to protect only the most likely outcome
 difolt byaaj ek aisa byaaj he jo ek udhaarkarta rin anubandh ko puraa naa kar paane kii sthiti main adaa karata he
 The default interest is usually significantly higher than the principal interest because it reflects an increase in the financial risk of the borrower
 difolt byaaj rindaata ko atirikt jokhim ke liye muaavja pradaan karata he
 The bank adds default interest to separate loan agreements between different scenarios
 keval mudrasphiti ke baraabar byaaj kii maang karne se rindaata kii kray shakti vahi rah jaaegi, lekin vah apane hi khapat ko baad kii tulana main jaldi hi pasand karegaa
 There will be an interest premium for the delay
 vah upbhog nahin karnaa chahta hoga, lekin iske bajaay vah ek anya utpaada main nivesh karegaa
