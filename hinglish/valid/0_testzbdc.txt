 The measurement of the magnitude of a physical amount in numbers is called measurement
 maapan multah tulana karne kii ek prakriya he
 In this the amount of a physical amount is compared to a predetermined quantity
 is purvanirdhaarit maatra ko us raashi-vishesh ke liye maatrak kaha jaataa he
 For example, when we say that the height of a tree is 10 meters, we are comparing the height of that tree with one meter
 yahan meter ek maanak maatrak he jo bhautik raashi lambaai yaa duuri ke liye prayukt hota he
 Similarly, unit of time is second, unit of mass is kilogram etc
 lord kelvin kaa nimnlikhit kathan maapan ke mahatv ko pratipaadit karata he- One way to classify measurements in research methodology is to determine the level of measurement
 chunki maapan main gunon ko sankhyaon dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he or sankhyaon ke kuch prakritik or mul gun hote hai jaise - unki ananyta, kramikta, nishchit antaraal par sthit hona ityadi; ham maapan kaa vargeekaran is aadhaar par kar sakate hai ki usamen sankhyaon ke kitne gunon kaa samavesh kiya gaya he
 On this basis, psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens gave four levels of measurement - nominal measure, ordinal measure, interval measure and ratio measure
 in shreniyon kaa prayog shodh kaaryon main hota he or vahaan yah kisi pariklpana ke satyata pareekshan ke liye prayog main laayi ja rahi sankhyikeey vidhiyon ke chayan main mahatvapurn hota he
 For example, if a measurement is at a nominal or ordinal level, a parallel mean cannot be derived to find the average of the available data
 Only polymer can be used

 To measure any of these quantities, a certain and convenient quantity is considered standard
 isamen puri maatra maap lee jaati he
 We consider this unit, or unit, or unit of that particular amount

 Different types of units are used
 vigyaan main lambaai, bhaar or samay ko mul ikai kii sangya di gai he, kyonki ye teenon rashiyaan ek duusare par nirbhar nahin karti hai
 All other types of units have their base units

 Thus, the unit of area is the area of a square that has one length and also one width
 aaytan kii ikai ek aise dhan kaa aaytan mana gaya he jisaki prayek bhujaa kii lambaai ek ho
 Thus it is clear that the unit of area and the unit of volume arise from the unit of length

 It is also called metered method, or 'centimeter gram second method'
 is paddati ko sansar bhar main vaigyanik kaaryon main upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this, the length is measured in centimeters, weight in grams and time in one second
 metry paddati hi parivartit parivardhit karke meter-kilogram-second paddati bani jo punah parivardhit hokar antararashtriya ikai pranali bani
 The standard unit of length in a metered system is called a meter

1 centimeter = 0
01 decimeter = 0
001 meter
 atev metry pranali main ikaayiyon ko keval dashamalav ke sthanantaran karne se hi badla ja saktaa he, jo atyant suvidhajanak he
 Thus it is clear that the metering system is a very convenient method

 yah landan ke rajkosh karyaalay main rakhe 62 degree fahrenheit taap par kaansya ke danda par sthit swarna-daaton par bani hui rekhaon ke bich kii duuri he
 Comparison of all measurements of length makes it clear that metric system is the most convenient and scientific among all methods
 bharat sarkaar ne isi baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, saare desh main metry pranali ke upyog ke liye kanoon bana diya he
 The length units in both methods have these relationships: lambaai ko maapne ke liye lakdi yaa dhaatu kii bani hui, paimaanon vaali patariyaan, yaa anya vastu ke bane feete, kaam main laae jate hai
 Their edges are either carved in centimeters and millimeters, or in inches and tenths, eighths or sixteenths of it

 Its value has been found to be constant
 nakshatra diwas madhya surya din se lagbhag chaar minute kam hota he
 The oscillator is used to find out whether the two time intervals are equal, or to divide the standard time into equivalent time intervals

 inkaa nijee gurutvkarshan inke dravya ko sanghatit rakhata he
 Scattered like dots of light at night in the cloudless sky, flickering lights show many stars
 kuch chamakate taron ke samooh akaash ko vibhinn bhaagon main baant dete hai
 The group of these stars is called the constellation
 puure akaash ko 89 taramandalon main vibhakt karke un taramandalon ke naam rakh die gaye hai
 The constellations of the zodiac are very famous, their nouns are Aries, Taurus etc
 kisi ek taramandal ke taron ko unke drishy kantimaan ke avaroh kram main chun liya jaataa he
 Asterisks are then named by placing Greek letters next to the constellation's name, such as the brightest star of the Aries zodiac named after the alphabet
 kuch taramandalon main taron kii sankhya itani adhik he ki greek varnmaala ke aksharon kii sankhya unke liye kam pad jaati he
 For naming such strings, we write the former Latin letters of the constellations and numbers if necessary
 kuch taare atiprakashit hone ke kaaran atiprasiddh hai tathaa unke naam taramandalon ke sandarbh ke bina bhi jane ja sakate hen, jaise lubdhak, magha, chitra aadi
 This type of nomenclature helps to identify strings
 khaali aankhon se dekhne par kuch taare adhik chamkile tathaa kuch kam chamkile dikhaai dete hai
 According to their radiance, we classify the stars into several radians
 taare hamase bahut adhik duuri par sthit hai
 We do not see less bright stars as the distance increases
 bina yantra kii sahaayta ke hamaari ankhen chathe kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakati hai
 The classification of radians is such that the stars appear brightest, their minimums are considered to be the minimum number of stars, less than that of bright stars, and so on
 kantimaan ke taare kii apeksha use purvavarti kantimaan taare kii chamak athwa 2
512 guna adhik hoti he
 In this way, the star of the first radiance is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the second radius and the star of the second radius is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the third radius
 yadi ham chathe kantimaan ke taare kii chamak 1 maan len, to pratham kantimaan se chathe kantimaan tak ke taron kii chamak 100:39
82:15
85:6:31 : 2:51 : 1 anupaat main hogi
 In the measurement of this visual radiance, the sun has a radius of - 26
72, a moon of - 12
5 and a star with a fading star - 1

 mount palomar vedhashala ke 200 inch vyas ke paravarti doordarshee se ham 23 kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakate hai
 Current measurement means the measurement of the intensity of starlight
 pehle yah kaary vishesh prakaar ke photomeateron kii sahaayta se aankhon dwaara kiya jaataa tha
 The records obtained in this way are called visual records
 ankhen pile prakaash kii sugrahi hai, at: drishyakantimaan pile or hare rang ke prakaash ke maapak hai
 Later the decoction was done with the help of photography plates
 is prakaar se gyaat kaantikan ko photography kantimaan kehete hai
 Photographic currents are measures of blue light
 taare kai rangon ke prakaash vikeern karte hai
 Therefore, the intensity of light is measured by sensitized plates of different colors and by the use of pigments to determine the strength of stars
 pile rang kii sugrahi platon par pile rangashodhakon se photography tathaa drishy kantimanon ke antar ko varna suchak kehete hai
 This determines the temperature of the wires
 kantimaan photograhi selon par prakaash ko grahan kar tathaa use bahugunit kar prakaash kii tivrata maapi jaati he
 While measuring current we also have to keep in mind the effect of the atmosphere and the effect of the interstellar dust and gases of the stars
 kantimaan ke yatharth gyaan se hamen taron kii dooriyaan tathaa bahut se bhautik padaartho ko jaanane main sahaayta milti he
 The personal light of many stars is very high, but due to being stationary at a great distance, their visible record is more visible
 yatharth kantimaan to tabhi gyaat ho saktaa he, jab ve upamaatr se samaan duuri par sthit hon
 All the stars are imagined at a distance of 10 parsecs, and the known value is called absolute value
 yadi hamen taare kaa drishy kantimaan gyaat ho tathaa uski duuri gyaat ho to ham nimnlikhit sutara se nirpeksh kantimaan jaan sakate hai: 5– 5 logarithmic distances are in the parsecs
 vilomat: yadi hamen nirpeksh kantimaan gyaat ho to ham taron kii dooriyaan bhi jaan sakate hai
 The absolute record of the Sun is 4
7
 kisi taare kii surya ke saapeksh kanti ko saapeksh kanti kehete hai
 In this, the radian of the Sun is assumed to be 1
 is prakaar ke adhyayan se ham taron se praapt honevaali urja kaa adhyayan karte hai, jisase unki bhautik sthitiyon ke adhyayan main sahaayta milti he
 No 8 no purnataya nirmal akaash main hamen drushti sahaayak yantron ke 3,200 se adhik taare nahin dikhalaai padate
 Since we can see only half of the sky, the number of microscopic stars is about 6,500
 inamen 20 stars brighter than 1,5 radiance 2 kantimaan tak chamkile 50 taare hai 150 stars up to 3 radiant 4 kantimaan tak chamkile 500 taare hai Tara 5 shines to 1500 bright stars shesh chakshudrishy taare chathe kantimaan ke he
 If we make our vision 10 times inward, then the number of visible stars will increase by 1000 times, that is, if the stars are assumed to be spread evenly, then their number will increase by six times their distance
 yah sambandh adhik chamkile taron tak hi simit he
 The number of stars known by the largest telescope in a lesser galaxy is about 1, xxwrep 2 00, 000
 taare kii vaastavik gati tathaa gamandisha gyaat karne ke liye ham uski gati ko do bhaagon main baant lete hai
 The angular value of the motion of the perpendicular direction on the sight is called the private motion of the star
 taron kii nijee gatiyaan kam hotin hai
 In order to find them we have to compare the photographs of stars taken in very distant times
 jo taare hamaare nikat hai, ve doorvarti taron ke saapeksh aage peeche hat jate hai
 By dividing this angular value by the interval of time, the individual speeds become known
 is koniya drushtisutra kii disha kii tarak gati ko traigy veg kehete hai
 To find the radial velocity, we take the spectrum of stars with the help of spectroscopy
 yadi varnakram rekhaayen nile chor kii taraf hati hon, to ham dopalar sidwant kii sahaayta se jaan lete hai ki tara hamaari ore aa rahaa he tathaa, yadi varnakram rekhaayen laal chor kii ore hati hon, to ham se dur ja rahaa he
 The transfer of lines is inversely proportional to their triangulation
 banard ne ophiukas taramandal ke ek dashm kantiman ke taare kii nijee gati 10
3 prati varsh gyaat kii he, jo vishaltam he
 Knowledge of private motion is helpful in the study of the stars and from this we also know that the stars of more blue motion are relatively closer to us
 traigy veg kaa surya ke saapeksh gyaan karne ke liye, hamen prithvi kii gati ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 The knowledge of private motion and radial velocity makes the actual speed and its direction known by the principle of force-parallel-quadrilateral
 taron kii dooriyaan gyaat karne ke liye trikoshmetiya vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The star closest to us is also at such a distance that if we consider the diameter of the Earth as its base, then they seem to be parallel, that is, the parallax of the star is zero
 at: taron ke lamban ko gyaat karne ke liye hamen bade aadhaar kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Therefore, we base the diameter of the Earth's orbit
 yadi ham kisi taare kii disha ke ek vedh ke chha: maheene baad uskaa vegh karen to hamen prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas kaa aadhaar mil jaataa he
 With this type of perforation, the nearest stars show slight changes relative to the distant stars
 ise nikaalte samay hamen taare kii nijee gati ke prabhaav par bhi vichaar karnaa padataa he
 Even then it is so low that the parallax of the nearest star is 76
 yadi kisi taare kaa lamban 1 ho to vah prithvi se prithvi kii kaksha kii trigya se 2,06,265 guni duuri par hota he
 This distance is called a parsec
 duuri maapne ke liye jis anya ikai kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, vah he prakashavarsh 
 The velocity of light is 1,86,000 miles per second
 is veg se prakaash ek varsh main jitani duuri tak jaataa he utani duuri ko ek prakaash varsh kehete hai yah duuri lagbhag 60, xxwrep 2 00, 000 mile hoti he
 a parsec is about 3
26 light years
 trikoshmetiya vidhi se ham keval atyant samipsth taron kii dooriyaan hi gyaat kar sakate hai
 Therefore, to find the distances of distant stars, we have to take shelter of other methods
 yadi ham kisi prakaar taron ke nirpeksh kantimaan ko jaan saken, to ham nirpeksh kantimaan sheershak main die gaye sutara kii sahaayta se unki dooriyaan gyaat kar sakate hai
 Fortunately, we have stars of Cefide and Lyra, whose absolute values we can find
 taron ke lambnon ko gyaat karne kii nimnlikhit anya vidhiyaan hai: These classifications have personal significance and they give us special help in the analysis of stars
 in vargikarnon kaa sankshipt parichay nimnlikhit he: The Sun is our nearest star, which we can study very well
 taron ke tatwon ke adhyayan se hamen adhikansh taare aise uplabdh hote he, jinka janm lagbhag usee samay hua jis samay hamaare surya kaa
 These stars are in descending sequence of temperature, shape and radiance
 is varg ko mukhya anukram kehete hai
 In this, the size of the stars of extreme heat will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about the tithe of the Sun
 surya isi anukram kaa ek majhole aakaar kaa tara he, jisaki dravyamatra tathaa taap ausat se kam he
 Upward stars in the curve of the main sequence are extremely rare
 is anukram ke adhikansh taare surya se chote tathaa kam taap ke hai
 The amount of elements available in them is like the Sun
 surya ke adhyayan se ham is varg ke atirikt taron ke do or mukhya varg he: daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed hai
 Dancing, and leftward stars
 daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed - daanavkaar, ati daanavaakar tathaa upadanavaakar 
 Extravagant stars are very large in size
 udaahranarth, jyeshtha kaa vyas surya ke vyas kaa lagbhag 300 guna he
 In celestial stars, the diameter of the second beta pigassi of the Khagashv is 170 times the diameter of the Sun and that of the Brahmin is 12 times the diameter of the Sun
 upadanavaakar taare mukhya anukram tathaa daanav varg ke taara ke bich sthit hai
 Left-wing stars also have Vamana, Upavaman, Lalrang Vamana and white-vamana distinction
 in virgon main shwet vamanakaar taare apana vishesh mahatv rakhte hai
 Their specialty is that their mass volume is mid-range and less radiant, but their size is very small and their density is extremely high
 hamen jitne taare dikhaai dete hai, unamem atyadhik maatra main ve taare hai, jo hamaari gallexi ke sadsy hai
 Our Galaxy is a world in itself
 iskaa aakaar sarpil he
 There are many other celestials, which have a spiral shape
 unki rachana tathaa akruti kaa adhyayan karne ke liye hamen apni akashganga ke kuch vishesh prakaar ke taron ke adhyayan se sahaayta milti he
 There are mainly two classes of these stars
 kuch taare sadaa gallexi kii sarpil bhujaaon main uplabdh hote hai tathaa anya gallexi ke nabhik ke nikat paae jate hai
 Among them, the stars of the first class are immediate neighbors of our Sun and the stars of the second class are away from the Sun
 walter wade ne pratham varg ke taron kaa naam pratham tara shrenee, athwa population pratham, tathaa duusare varg ke taron kaa naam dwitiya tara shrenee, athwa population dwitiya rakhaa he
 Both of these types of Taravargo vary in spectral-radius-curves
 pratham tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare nile rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan 7 athwa 8 hota he, jabaki dwitiya tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare laal rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan - 3 yaa usase adhik hota he
 In the stars of the first star, there is an excessive amount of interstellar gas and dust, while in the stars of the second star it is very small
 in tarashreniyon ke adhyayan se hame gallexion kii sarpil bhujaaon tathaa nabhikon ko nishchit karne maatr ke hi liye nahin, kintu inase hamen taron kii utpatti tathaa vikaas kii sthiti kaa adhyayan karne main bhi sahaayta milti he
 Molecules of the mass of stars, which remain neutral in the atmosphere, become ionized due to the progressive increase in temperature and they lose more and more of their negative electrons
 iske prabhaav se aise taron ke varnakram main bananevaali chamakili or kaali rekhaon main vibhinnata aa jaati he
 In other words, the lines represent the different states of heat of the molecules that radiate the light of stars
 is prakaar taron ke varnakramon ke adhyayan se unke mukhya 10 bhed kiye gaye hai, jinhen roman lipi ke bade aksharon o, bi, e, epa, ji, ke, em, aar, en, tathaa es se vyakt karte hai
 Since alphabetical classification is related to temperature, the smaller alphabet a to e of the English alphabet is placed after o for strings of o spectrum and O, to show successive degradation of the temperature of the same class of stars
 Oba etc
 isi prakaar ke abhipraay ko vyakt karne ke liye bi se em ke varnakram ke taron ke liye unke suchak aksharon ke baad 0 se lekar 9 tak ke ank rakhe jate hai
 These are ionized helium stars
 inke varnakramon main ynikrut helium tathaa dohare tihare ynikrut oxigen tathaa nitrogen kii rekhaayen praapt hotin hai
 According to this ionized state, its surface temperature should be from 30, xxrep 4 0 to 40, xxrep 4 0 c or more
 o varnakram ke gyaat taron kii sankhya sau se adhik nahin he, jinamein adhikash nangi aankhon se nahin dekhe ja sakate
 The three stars of this class, Gama Beloram Oy, Zeta Pappis Oy and Zitaorayan, are Oi5 Chakshu Darshan
 ye udasin helium vaale taare hai
 Their surface temperature ranges from 25,000 ° to 12,000 ° C
 yah taap yadhyapi helium ko ynikrut karne main asamarth he, tathaapi iske varnakram main ynikrut oxigen rekhaayen uplabdh hotin hai
 Helium and ionized oxygen lines begin to decrease in stars from the B5 star to the lower heat, and hydrogen lines and broad black absorption lines of hydrogen emerge
 hamaari tarasuchiyon main bi taare bahut hai
 These are the major stars of hydrogen
 inkaa prishthiya taap 12,000° se lekar 8,000° sein0 tak he
 Their number is very high
 kuch jyotishi inhe calcium taare kehete the
 Their surface heat ranges from 8,000 ° to 6,000 ° 0
 ye surya kii shrenee ke taare hai
 The lines of ionized calcium in their alphabet are very prominent
 inkaa prishthiya taap 6,000° se lekar 4,000° sein0 tak he
 12,000 ° g spectral stars have been identified
 inkaa prishthiya taap 5,000° se lekar 3,5000 sein° tak hota he
 Earlier they were known as Suryakalanka stars
 titonium oride taare
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,500 ° to 2,000 ° C
 inamen praaia: sabhi chal taare hai, jinamein keval chakshudrishy koi nahin he
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,000 ° to 5,000 ° N
 ye sabhi daanavaakar tathaa adhikanshat: chal taare hai
 These are very few in number
 inamen se koi bhi tara keval chakshu se saraltapurvak drishy nahin he
 There are some stars whose radiance keeps decreasing
 inhen chal taare kehete hai
 In order to give clear instructions of movable stars, big letters of English alphabet R, S, t etc
 are placed in front of the constellation, like r SETI etc
 inaki sankhya badhane ke saath ek akshar ke sthaan par do athwa teen akshar bhi rakhane pad sakate hai, yatha aar aar lira aadi
 About 20,000 movable stars are known and they are weighed regularly
 taron ke do vishaal varg hai: pehla bahyahetuk chal tathaa doosraa swat: chal
 Extraterrestrial moving stars are receptive pair stars
 inamen algul tara prasiddh he
 Its normal record is 2
2, but it goes up to 3
4
 swat: chal taare teen shreniyon main rakhe ja sakate hai: sapandansheel chal, visphotak chal tathaa anya chal taare
 Some of these stars have a rotation period of less than a day
 aise taare aar aar lira varg ke hai
 The rotation period of some is from 1 to 50 days
 aise taare sefiid varg ke taare hai
 The rotation period of some stars ranges from 100 to 1000 days
 inhen dirdh aavartkaalik taare kehete hai
 The stars of this class are red colored stars
 kuch taare ardhniyamit chal hai, inkaa chakra 40 se lekar 150 din tak kaa he
 These stars are also red colored stars
 inamen aar aar lira tathaa sefiid taare atyant mahatvapurn hai
 r Lyra stars got its name because all of these properties are similar to the moving star described in Lyra Planetarium, which was named RR Lyra
 naam se yah na samajhnaa chahie ki aise taare keval lira taramandal main hi hote hai, kintu is shrenee ke taare hamaari gallexi tathaa anya tarapranaliyon aadi main sarvatra hai
 The reason for the importance of these stars is their distancing
 aar aar lira varg ke taron main aavartankaal ke badhane par par bhi unke nirpeksh kantimaan main antar nahin padataa
 This means that if one of the galaxial stars has RR Lyra stars, they will be of the same absolute radius and it is almost equal to zero of the same absolute radius
 aisi avasthaa main unke drishy kantimaan ke gyaan se unki duuri nimnlikhit sutara dwaara gyaat ho sakati he
 Absolute radius = visual radius + 5 - 5 logarithmic distance inkaa yah naam isliye padaa ki inaki prakruti delta sefius, athwa chartuth kapish, kii tarah kii he
 The fourth Auburn is the brightest star in the Cepheid category, which can be seen from the eye
 sefiod taron kaa aavartankaal ek din se kuch adhik se lekar 45 din se kuch adhik he
 Our galaxy's cepheid stars often have a 7-day rotation period
 sefiid taron kii sabase badi visheshta he inkaa aavartankaal-kanti-saahchary niyam se sangat hona
 This means that as the growth period of the cepheid wires increases, their absolute value increases
 yah sambandh atyant mahatvapurn he
 With its help, the distance can be determined by the previous formula by knowing the absolute value of the safe stars
 sefiid taron kii sahaayta se taragucchon tathaa tarapaddatiyon kii duuri gyaat kii jaati hai
 The reason for the change of thermogenic color is generally assumed to be the flutter principle, which means that the rotation of the surface of the cepheid wires causes growth and depletion, causing the star to expand and shrink sequentially
 vastut: spandan siddhant sabhi sthitiyon kaa yatharth uttar nahin detaa
 Therefore, nowadays astrologers are beginning to understand that the different positions of cefoid stars are due to the change of their temperature, which itself is an iterative cycle
 1,000 se adhik sefiid taare gyaat he
 Such wires explode regularly or irregularly
 ye taare saamanyat: atyant dhundle hote hai, kintu visphot hone ke baad inaki kanti atyant asaadhaaran rup se bad jaati he
 After this situation lasts for a few days, the stars fall into their normal radius
 is prakaar ke taron ko navtara kehete hai
 In 1918, the glow of the Navatar of Aquila Tarapunja had increased by forty thousand times within four days
 anya prasiddh navtare hai: parasyus taramandal kaa navtara, 1925 i0 victoris navtara tathaa 1934 i0 kaa harkulis taramandal kaa navtara
 Those who become very exceptionally bright after the Navatarite explosion are called Atinavatara
 1885 i0 ke andromida niharika ke atinavtaare ne chah dinon main itnaa adhik prakaash vikeern kiya ki surya kadachit utane prakaash ko 10 lakh varsho main vikeern kar paaegaa
 Other types of moving stars are often of irregular rotation
 kisi svachh raatri main akaash main kuch dhundle prakaash ke dhabbe se dikhaai dete hai
 If we look at them with powerful instruments, then we find three types of things: star flakes, nebulae and galaxies
 niharikas chamakili gaison se bani hai tathaa aakashgangaayen hamaari gallexi kii tarah swatantra tarapranaliyaan hai
 There are two types of star flakes, one that is available in the sky-like plane, or near the celestial spiral arms
 aise guchchhe akashgangeey guchchhe kehalaate hai
 The number of stars in these is relatively less
 is prakaar ke varg main krittika tara guchchhe atyadhik chamkila tathaa bada he
 The globular globules lie away from the spiral arms and near the nucleus
 golakaar taragucchon main apekshaakrit atyaadhik taare rahete hai
 They are often seen with a twist
 inhen doordarshiyon se hi dekha jaataa he
 The Ombanga Sentari and 47 Tukane Panchal Kantiman, Chakshudhishyas, are related to the population of the spherical galaxy
 avashya hi inase taron ke vikaas kii avasthaaon kaa gyaan hota he
 The distance of the cluster is determined with the help of the RR Lyra and cepheid wires present in these wires
 inke adhyayan se gallexi ke swaroop ke adhyayan main bahut sahaayta milti he
 Most stars are double, or majority, they do not have anything interconnected in pairs of stars, but they appear very close because they are located towards our line of sight
 aise taron ko chakshush, dohare taare kehete hai
 Such stars are few
 adhikansh taare vastut: ek yaa adhik taron ke saath hai
 Two stars, which travel in a certain type of longitudinal path with mutual attraction, are called star-pairs
 yah nishchay ho jane par ki koi tara vastut: yugma hai, ham uske sambandh kii bahut si baaten gyaat kar sakate hai, kyonki uski, athwa uske saathi tara kii, gati vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam kaa paalan karti hai
 The speed and mass of the pair wires can be determined with certainty
 yugmatare mukhyatya teen prakaar ke hote hai: drishy, grahauakari tathaa varnakrameey 
 To know the class of visual pair, one has to weigh their distance and angle of view
 adhikansh drishy yugmataron kaa parikramankal bahut lanbaa hota he, jise gyaat karne ke liye saikadon varshon tak vegh kii aavashyaktaa he
 Therefore, although more than 25,000 visual pairings have been known, the knowledge of more than 200 orbits is not yet known
 grahauakari yugmatare ke sahchar kii kaksha praaia: hamaari drushtirekha kii disha main thode se jhukaav se rahati he, jisase ek tara duusare ko purnataya yaa khandash: dhak letaa he or isse ek taare kaa prakaash hamen dikhaai nahin padataa
 This allows the pair to be identified, because in normal conditions, the amount of light that this star has remains at the time of eclipse decreases
 yah grahan kii sthiti niyat samay se hotin hai
 In such strings, the Beta percussion, that is, Algool, is very famous
 saamaanya avasthaa main iskaa kantimaan 2
2 hota he, ja grahan ke samay 3
4 rah jaataa he
 After the eclipse, its record becomes 2
2 again
 kuch yugmataron ke sahchar kii kaksha kaa samtal prithvi ke sameep se nahin jaataa, at: ham uske grahan kii sthiti nahin dekh sakate hai
 But by changing the lines of its spectrum, we get to know that this star sometimes comes towards us and sometimes goes away from us, so that it is clear that it is flying around an invisible star
 aise taare varnakrameey yugmataron kaa parikraman kaal kam hota he
 Classes of about 309 spectral stars have been known
 taron ke aakaar praaia: teen vidhiyon se jane jate hai: From absolute temperature and temperature, grahauakari yugmataron ke grahankaal se tathaa By interferometer
 pratham vidhi plank ke nimnlikhit sutara par aadhaarit he: View Absolute Record Mvis = - 5 log - 0
08 jahaan r = taare kii trigya he
 The radius relative to its orbit becomes known by the time of eclipse of the eclipse star
 vyatikaranmaapi se taare kaa koniya vyas gyaat ho jaataa he tathaa isaki duuri gyaat hone se iskaa saral rekhaatmak vyas bhi gyaat ho jaataa he
 On the basis of the diameter of the stars, their names are donated and left
 taron kii dravyamatra gyaat karne kii pratyaksh vidhi yugma taron ke sahachaar kii gati kaa adhyayan karne se praapt hotin hai
 The mass quantities of these stars are determined with the help of the law of gravitation
 kisi bhi vaaman taare kii dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra ke dashamansh se kam nahin uplabdh hui hai, tathaa surya se 10 guni se adhik dravyamatra ke taare bhi viral hi hai
 Density of a star = mass / volume
 is prakaar dekhne se pataa chalata he ki daanavaakar taron kaa ghanatv atyant kam hota he tathaa vamanakaar taron kaa atyadhik
 The diameter of a giant star like Jyeshta is 480 times the diameter of the Sun, even if its mass is no more than 20 times the mass of the Sun
 parinamat: iskaa ghanatv surya ke ghanatv ke 
 xxrep 7 0 2 se bhi kam he
