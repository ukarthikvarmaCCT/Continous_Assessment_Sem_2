 janasankhyikee, maanav jansankhya kaa sankhyikeey adhyayan he
 This can be a very general science that can be applied to any kind of dynamic human population, ie a population that changes over time and space
 This includes the study of population size, structure and distribution and spatial and / or temporal changes in terms of birth, migration, aging and death
 janasankhyikeey vishleshan ko shiksha, rashtriyata, dharm or jaateeyata jaise mandandon ke aadhaar par vibhajit puure samaaj par yaa samoohon par lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 In the field of education, demography is often considered as a branch of sociology, economics or anthropology
 aupchaarik janasankhyikee ke adhyayan kaa lakshya, jansankhya kii prakriyaaon ke maapan tak simit he, jabaki saamaajik janasankhyikee jansankhya adhyayan kaa adhik vyapak kshetra, ek jansankhya ko prabhavit karne vaale aarthik, saamaajik, saanskrithik or jaivik prakriyaaon ke bich sambandhon kaa vishleshan karata he
 The term demographics is often mistakenly used to refer to demographics, but refers to characteristics of a particular public community, used in government, marketing, or opinion research, or the demographic profile used in such research
 data sangrah ke do tareeke hai: pratyaksh or apratyaksh
 pratyaksh data, mahatvapurn panjikrut aankadon se aata he jo sabhi janm or mrityu kii toh rakhata he or saath hi saath kanoonee sthiti main kuch khaas parivartanon kaa bhi, jaise vivaah, talaak or pravaas 
 behatar panjikaran pranali vaale viksit deshon main, janm or mrityu kii sankhya kaa akalan karne ke liye panjikaran aankade sabase acha tarika he
 Another direct common method of collecting demographic data is the census
 a census is usually conducted by the national government and attempts to count every person in the country
 baharhaal, mahatvapurn sankhyikee aankadon ke vipareet, jinhen aam taur par lagaataar ekatra kiya jaataa he or ek vaarshik aadhaar par sankshepit kiya jaataa he, janaganana saamanyatya keval har 10 saal main ghatit hoti he or is prakaar aam taur par janm or mrityu ke aankadon ke liye sabase acha strot nahin hai
 Analyzes are conducted after a census to estimate how much has been counted or under-counted
 janaganana main logon kii sirf ginati ke alaava, kaaphi kuch hota he
 They typically gather information about individual characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, literacy / education, employment status, and occupation and geographic location, along with gathering information about families or households
 ve pravaas, bhashaa, dharm, rashtriyata or naagarikta ke aankade bhi ekatra kar sakate hai
 In countries where important registration systems are incomplete, census is also used as a direct source of information about mortality and fertility; The Census of the People's Republic of China, for example, collects information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately before the census
 aankade ekatra karne ke apratyaksh tareekon kii zarurat un deshon main hoti he jahaan puure aankade uplabdh nahin hai, jaise ki adhikansh vikasshil deshon ke maamle main
 inamen se ek takanic he bahan vidhi, jahaan surveykshan ke shodhakarta, mahilaon se poochhate hai ki unki bahanon main kitni mar gayi yaa unke kitne bachche the or kitni umr thi
 With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population
 anya apratyaksh tareekon main shaamil he logon se bhai bahan, mata pita or bacchon ke bare main poochna
 Several types of demographic methods exist to formulate population processes
 unamem shaamil he mrityu sankhya kaa model, prajnan, vivaah, viklaangata, jansankhya anumaan or jansankhya gati 
 Important concepts of demography include: ek sthai jansankhya kaa aakaar, zaruri nahin ki nishchit bana rahe, yah badhata or ghatata rahata he
 Note that the crude mortality rate defined above and which is applied to an entire population may give a misleading assumption
 udhaaharan ke liye, prati 1000 logon main mauton kii sankhya, kam viksit deshon kii tulana main viksit deshon ke liye adhik ho sakati he, iske baavjood ki viksit deshon main swasthya kaa str behatar he
 This is because in developed countries there are proportionately more older people, who are more likely to die in a specific year, due to which the overall death rate may be higher even if the death rate is lower at a given age
 mrityu dar kii adhik purna tasviir ek alag jivan talika dwaara prastut kiya gaya he jo prayek aayu main mrityu dar kaa saransh pesh karti he
 To provide a good estimate of life expectancy, a life table is necessary
 prajnan dar bhi ek bhraamak dharna prastut kar sakati he ki jansankhya teji se bad rahi he jabaki shaayad vastav main aisa naa ho, kyonki prajnan dar ke maapan main keval mahilaon kii prajnan dar shaamil hoti he or yah ling anupaat ke liye samyojit nahin hota he
 For example, if a population has a total fertility rate of 4
0 but a sex ratio of 66 / 34, compared to a population with a fertility rate of 3
0 and a sex ratio of 50 / 50, this population is actually slower than the natural growth rate Increasing
 yah virupan bharat or myanmar main sabase zyaada he or china main bhi maujuud he
 Suppose that a country consists of a population t people at t time
 samay t + 1 par jansankhya kaa aakaar kya hoga? Natural increase from time t to t + 1 samay t se t + 1 tak nival pravaas This basic equation can also be applied to subpopulations
 udhaaharan ke liye, jaateey samoohon yaa samaaj athwa desh ke bheetar kisi aabaadi kaa aakaar, badlaav ke usee samaan strot ke adheen he
 However, when working on ethnic groups, "net migration" may have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reintegration
 jo vyakti apane jaateey label ko badalte hai yaa jinka jaateey vargeekaran sarkari aankadon main samay ke saath parivartit hota he, unhen pravasi athwa jansankhya kii ek upashrenee se duusari main jane vaala samajha ja saktaa he
 More generally, while the basic demographic equation is, by definition, correct, the recording and counting of events in practice and the calculation of the total population size are subject to error
 isliye jab bhi jansankhya ke aakaar yaa badlaav kii gananaa kii jaati he to antarnihit aankadon main truti ke liye chhot kii zarurat hoti he
 Ibn Khaldun is considered the "father of demography" because of the economic analysis of his social organization that led to the first scientific and theoretical work on population, development and group dynamics

 The first textbook on the Contingencies of Life, published in 1771, is credited to Richard Price, and then to Augustus de Morgan, 'on the Application of Probabilities to Life Continuities'
 18veen sadi ke ant main, thomas malths ne nishkarsh nikaala ki agar roka naa jaae to jansankhya ghaatankeey vruddhi ke adheen ho jaaegi
 unhen dar tha ki jansankhya vruddhi, khaadya utpaadan main vruddhi se kahin aage nikal jaaegi jisase garibi or akaal kaa prakope badhata rahegaa ; unhen ati-jansankhya ke vichaaron ke bauddhik pita ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Later, more sophisticated and realistic models were introduced, for example by Verhulst and Benjamin Gompertz
 1860-1910 kii avadhi ko sankraman kii avadhi ke rup main nirdisht kiya ja saktaa he jab janasankhyikee, sankhyikee se ek alag kshetra ke rup main ubhari
 is avadhi main kai mahaan antarrashtriya janasankhyikee vidwaanon kaa pradurbhaav hua, jaise adolf quatellette, wiliam for, louis adolf berteylon or unka betaa jaik, joseph corosi, anders nicholas ker, richard bokh, wilhem lexis or luigi bodio, sabhi ne janasankhyikee tathaa vidhiyon ke upkarnon or janasankhyikeey vishleshan kii takneekon ke vikaas main yogadan diya
 Contrary to Malthus's predictions and in line with his views on moral restraint, natural population growth in most developed countries has decreased to near zero and that too without any famine or resource scarcity, since people in developed countries have fewer children The tendency to produce is being seen
 in deshon main jivan pratyaasha main baari badhotaree ke baavjood jansankhya vruddhi main giravat hui he
 This method of population growth, where growth is slow in pre-industrial society and then with the development and industrialization of that society, a rapid increase in population is observed, after which this growth is reduced again as this society becomes more prosperous
 , It is known as demographic transition
 isi tarah ke rujhaan ab adhik vikasshil deshon main dekhe ja rahe hai, isliye niyantran se baahar jane kii bajaay, vaishvik jansankhya vruddhi ke is sadi main spasht rup se dhime hone kii ummid he, jo ant main thahar jaayegi yaa isamen giravat bhi ho sakati he
 With this change, there is likely to be a big change in the proportion of the world population in particular areas
 sanyukt raashtra jansankhya prabhag ko ummid he ki duniya main shishuon or chote bacchon kii purna sankhya main 2015 tak giravat honi shuru ho jaayegi or 15 varsh ke andar ke bacchon kii sankhya main 2025 tak
 The figures in this section show the latest estimates of the world population of the year 2150 of the United Nations
 The "moderate" estimate of the United Nations shows the world's population reaching an estimated balance of 9 billion by 2075
 swatantra rup se kaam kar rahe, austria main international institute for aplide systams anelisis ke janasankhyikee vidwaanon ko ummid he ki duniya kii aabaadi 2070 tak 9 billian ke apane charam par pahonchegi
 sampoorn 21veen sadi ke dauraan, aabaadi kii ausat umr main vruddhi jari hone kii sambhaavna he
 Population can change through three processes: reproduction, death and migration
 Reproduction involves comparison with the number and fertility of a woman's children
 Mortality is the study of causes, consequences, and measurement of how the death process of members of a population is affected
 janasankhyikee vidwaan, adhikanshtah jivan talika kaa upyog kar ke mrityu dar kaa adhyayan karte hai, jo ek sankhyikeey upkaran he jo jansankhya main mrityu dar ke bare main jaankaree pradaan karata he
 Migration refers to the transfer of people as they move from a place of origin to a destination, across a pre-defined, political boundary
 pravaas ke shodhakarta un antaranon ko tab tak 'pravaas' namit nahin karte jab tak ki ve kuch had tak sthaayee naa hon
 is prakaar janasankhyikee vidwaan, paryatakon or yatriyon ko pravasi nahin samajhate
 haalanki, pravaas kaa adhyayan karne vaale janasankhyikee vidwaan, aam taur par nivas sthaan ke janaganana aankadon ke madhyam se aisa karte hai, aankadon ke apratyaksh strot jaise, tex form or shram shakti ke surveykshan bhi mahatvapurn hai

 In mathematics, hyperbolic functions are functions that resemble normal trigonometric functions, but are different functions
 hyperbolic sin "sinh", or hyperbolic kosine "cosh", moolbhoot atiparavalayik falan hai
 From these are derived the hyperbolic tangent "tanh", hyperbolic cosecant "csch" or "cosech", hyperbolic secondary "sech", and hyperbolic cotangent "coth"
 atiparavalayik falnon ko kai tarah se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 One method defines them as the function of exponential function - hyperbolic falnon ko avakal samikarnon ke hal ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine are unique solutions for the following system: such that s = 0 and c = 1
 These functions are also other solutions to the following equation - f ′′ = f, { \ displaystyle f '' = f,} such that f = 1, f ′ = 0, { \ displaystyle f = 1, f '= 0,} for the hyperbolic cosine, and f = 0, f ′ = 1, { \ displaystyle f = 0, f '= 1,} for the hyperbolic sine

 Netscape advertised "the web is for everyone" and stated one of its aims as "level the playing field" by providing a consistent web browsing experience between operating systems
 kisi bhi computer par netscape web brouzar antarfalak ek samaan tha
 Netscape later experimented with prototype of a web-based system that would enable users to access and edit their files anywhere within the network, no matter which computer or operating system they use
 
 is chiz par microsoft kaa dhyaan gaya, jisane oparating system ko utpaada banaae jane ko ke liye khatre ke rup main dekha, yani, windos ko chhodkar anya oparating system ko apnaane se samaan browzing anubhav hasil honge or is prakaar badalane ke liye baadhaaen kam hongi

 This time period is known as browser warfare, with Netscape Communicator and Internet Explorer adding several new features and releasing multiple version numbers in an attempt to outdo each other
 lekin internet explorer kaa palada baari tha, kyonki jitani janashakti or puunji isamen lagaai gai thi usne antat netscape ke puure kaarobaar main uplabdh sansadhano ko paar kar diya
 By version 3

 microsoft ne muft samanta ke saath netscape ke anya utpaadon ko bhi lakshith kiya, jaise internet information sarwar ke rup main, ek web sarwar jo ki windos anti ke saath judaa hua tha
 Netscape could not compete with this strategy
 vastav main, isane pratispardhaa karne kaa prayaas hi nahin kiya
 Netscape Navigator was not free to the general public until January 1998, while Internet Explorer and IIS were always free or associated with an operating system and / or other applications
 is bich, netscape ko apane utpaadon main badhate hue bag ke liye kaaphi aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa; aalochakon ne daawa kiya ki 'company jatilta se peedit he - nae suvidhaon ko jodne ke prayaas ko prathamikta di ja rahi thi lekin unke thik se kaam na karne par dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha

 Netscape publicly released the source code of Netscape Communicator 4
0 in the hope that it would become a popular open source project
 This allowed the code to publicly continue under the Netscape Public License, which was similar to the GNU General Public License but allowed Netscape to continue to publish proprietary work containing publicly issued code
 haalanki, is tarah se communicator 4
0 code jari rahaa, netscape communicator 4
5 main kaary karne laga jisamen email main sudhaar or udhyam kaaryakshmata par dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya tha
 It eventually became clear that the Communicator 4
0 browser was difficult to develop and open source development was halted on this codebase
 iske bajaay, open sorce vikaas ko scrtch dwaara nirmit ek agali peedi ke broujar ke liye sthanantarit kar diya gaya
 Using the newly built Gecko layout engine, this browser had a much more modular architecture than Communicator 4

 The merger was ridiculed by many who believed that the two corporate cultures would probably not fit; a prominent critic in its criticisms was longtime Netscape developer Jamie Zawinski
 is adhigrahan ko eoel dwaara internet explorer web brouzar par kam nirbhar banane ke ek maarg ke rup main microsoft ke khilaaf ek saudebaaji chip hasil karne kaa zariyaa dekha gaya
 Others believed that AOL was interested in Netcenter or the Netscape Web property, which had the most traffic worldwide

 On November 14, 2000, AOL released Netscape 6 based on Mozilla 0
6 source code
 
 Unfortunately, 0
6 Mozilla was not stable and so Netscape 6 drove people a bit further away from the Netscape brand
 yah agast 2001 tak netscape 6

 The date was later extended to 1 March to include major security updates and a tool to help users migrate to other browsers
 in atirikt suvidhaon main netscape nevigator 9 ke antim sanskaran ko 20 farvari 2008 main jari karnaa shaamil tha
 Netscape Navigator was a web browser from versions 1

 pehla beta sanskaran ko 1994 main jari kiya gaya tha or use mosek kaha gaya or baad main mosek netscape

 company kaa naam bhi mosek communications corporation se netscape communications corporation kar diya gaya
 This browser was the most advanced available at the time and so it became an instant success, causing it to become the king of the market but still in beta
 1
0 sanskaran ke jari hone ke baad netscape ke feechar-count or market share nirantar teji se badhata rahaa
 Version 2
0 added a full email reader called Netscape Mail, thus transforming Netscape from a mere web browser to an Internet suite
 email client kaa mukhya visisth feechar tha HTML ko dikhaane kii isaki kshamta
 is avadhi ke dauraan is suut ko netscape nevigator kaha jaataa tha
 Netscape's version 3

 lekin netscape aasaani se kuch samay ke liye number ek brouzar bana rahaa
 Netscape also released a gold version that included javascript RSA security and an Apple Inc

 netscape 4 ne netscape nevigator kii samasya ko sambodhit kiya jise suut ke dono naam main istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha or suut kaa punah namakaran netscape communicator karne ke dwaara broujar iske bheetar shaamil tha
 After five preview releases in 1996–1997, Netscape released the final version of Netscape Communicator in June 1997
 yah sanskaran kam yaa zyada netscape nevigator 3 code par aadhaarit tha or iskaa adhyatan rup tha or nai suvidhaon ko isamen joda gaya tha
 The new suite was successful despite increasing competition from Internet Explorer 4
0 and problems with older browser cores
 IE, 4
5 sanskaran tak mike platfarm par dhimi or asthir tha
 Despite this, Apple agreed to an agreement with Microsoft to make Eye the default browser on the new Mac OS installation, another blow to Netscape's reputation
 netscape nevigate, netscape mail and newsgrup, netscape adress book or netscape compoger se komunicator suut ko banaaya gaya tha
 In January 1998, Netscape Communicator Corporation announced that all possible versions of its software would be available for free and developed by the open source community, Mozilla
 Netscape Communicator 5

 haalanki, isaki relies ko kaaphi der se kiya gaya tha or isi bich internet explorer ke nae sanskaran jari hue the, jisaki shuruuaat sanskaran 4 se kii gai
 These had more features than the old Netscape, including support for HTML 4, CSS, DOM and ecmascript

 a month later, Netscape Communications Corporation was purchased by AOL
 navambar main, netscape 5
0 par kaam ko radd kar diya gaya or scrtch se puri tarah ek nae kaam ke vikaas par jor diya gaya
 In 1998, an informal group called the Mozilla Organization and largely funded by Netscape was actually to coordinate the development of Netscape 5, which was based on communicator source code
 haalanki, aging communicator code saath kaam karne ke liye mushkil sabit hua or scrap netscape 5 ke liye or sorce code ko phir se likhane kaa nirnay liya gaya
 The re-written source code was in the form of Mozilla web browser which was Netscape 6 based with some additional features
 is faisle kaa matlab tha ki netscape kaa agle mukhya sanskaran kaa kaaphi der se jari hona
 isi bich, netscape ko eoel dwaara le liya gaya tha jo web maanak pariyojna se kaaphi dabaav main kaam kar rahi thi, jiske chalate 2000 main iske nae divijan ko netscape 6
0 ko jari karne ke liye baadhya thi
 In addition to the built-in AOL instant messenger client, Netscape Instant Messenger, the suite once again included Netscape Navigator and other Communicator components
 However, it was clear that Netscape 6 was not yet ready for release and it flopped badly
 yah mozila 0
6 par aadhaarit thi, jo ki kai gambhir bags ke chalate saamaanya janata dwaara abhi tak istemaal ke liye taiyaar nahin thi jiske chalate aksar cras yaa web prishthon kaa dhire-dhire rendor hona ho saktaa tha
 Later versions of Netscape 6 were much better, but still struggled to make a browser impact on the depressed community

 It attracted some users, but was still a minority browser

 AOL continued the development work of the in-house Netscape, but with little to no committed staff, the improvement was minimal
 ek saal baad mozila par aadhaarit antim sanskaran agast 2004 main jari hua: mozila 1
7
2 ke aadhaar par netscape 7

 The Netscape 7 Series speculation of the suit came out after an official election was advertised on the Netscape Community Support Board in late 2006, supported and updated by Netscape's in-house development team
 aisa nahin hona tha
 Between 2005 and 2007, the released version of Netscape is known as Netscape Browser

 windos, linaks or mike oes eks ke bich browder ko multi-platfarm samarthan par vaapasi karte hue bhi dekha gaya
 Like the 8
x version of Netscape, the new release was based on the popular Mozilla Firefox and presumably provided full support for all Firefox add-ons and plugins, some of which already provided Netscape
 saath hi 2004 ke baad se pehali baar ke liye apane swayan ke karmchaariyon ke saath brouzar kaa utpaadan in-house kiya gaya
 a beta of the program was first released on 5 June 2007
 antim sanskaran ko 15 oktober 2007 ko jari kiya gaya
 AOL officially announced that Navigator Netscape will conclude on March 1, 2008 and recommends that its users download the Flock or Firefox browser, both based on the same technology

 In December 2007, AOL announced the development of Netscape with Messenger 9, as well as Navigator 9 being canceled
 netscape ke praarambhik utpaada shrinkhalaa main shaamil hai: Later Netscape products include: netscape ne javascript web pej scrypting bhashaa banaaya
 It has also been a pioneer in the development of "push technology", which effectively allows the Web site to continuously send information directly to the user's desktop; This implementation of Netscape is called Netcaster
 durbhaagya se, kaarobaar ne jaldi hi upyogkarta kii sahaayta ke liye push praudyogiki ke upyog kii manyata praapt kar lee thi or naaraaz upyogkarta is suvidha ko band kar diya, isliye netcaster alpakaalik hi rahaa
 Netscape was notable for its cross-platform effort
 isaki client software windos messintosh, linaks, OS / 2, beos unics ke kai sanskaran sahit DEC, san solaaris, BSDI, IRIX, IBM AIX or HP-UX ke liye uplabdhta jari he
 Its server software was generally only available for Unix and Windows NT, although some of its servers were made available on Linux and a version of Netscape fasttrack Server was made available for Windows 95 / 98
 aaj, netscape ke adhikansh sarwar san java system, jo ki purv main san van branding ke tahat tha, ke rup main live on pesh kar rahi he
 Although Netscape Browser 8 was Windows only, multi-platform support exists in the Netscape Navigator 9 series of browsers
 netscape aiespi ek 56 kbit / s-dial-ap seva he jise $9

 The company serves web pages in a compressed format for incremental effective speeds of up to 1300 kbit / s
 netscape brands ke tahat eoel dwaara internet seva pradaata ko chalaaya jaataa he
 The low-cost ISP was officially launched on 8 January 2004
 iskaa mukhya pratidwandvi netgero he
 The general purpose of Netscape isp's advertising is a small demographic, eg, college students and people who have passed away immediately from school, a common affordable way to use the Internet
 web exilrator text ko uske mul aakaar se lagbhag 4% purv-sampeedit kar detaa he or is prakaar prabhavi thruput ko 1300 kbit / s kar detaa he
 Also, this accelerator precompresses Flash executables and images by about 30% and 10% respectively
 netscape ise "niyamit phone line par dsel gati" ke rup main vigyaapit karata he haalanki aise hi gati keval web browzing main simit hoti he jisamen filon kii dowloding nahin hoti he
 Another drawback of this approach is the loss in quality, where the graphics become heavily solid and stained, but the speed increases dramatically so that web pages load in less than 5 seconds
 netscape hameshaa iske web propaties ke liye broujar menu main shaamil kai linkon se kaaphi treffic ho jate hai

 Now you forgive him and God! meri ek prarthana or he, lok-kalyaan ke liye aap is sthaan par sarvada ke liye nivas karen

 isaki sthapana 23 farvari, 1947 ko hui thi, vishwavyaapee audyogic evam vanijyik maanakon ko ghoshit karne hetu
 Its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland
 yadhyapi ISO swayan ko ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kahata he, isaki maanak sthapit karne kii kshamta, jo ki praay vidhi ban jate hai, yaa to samjhauton ke dwaara, yaa phir rashtriya maan; yah isko gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon se adhik shaktishaalee banaata he
 In practice, it is working like a faculty or short-term organization, which has strong links with governments
 
 The logo or symbol of this organization is American English and French in two official languages
 isamen ISO akshar bhi sammilit hai, jinase yah praayah janaa jaataa he, jo ki isaki sankshipti he
 Rather this abbreviation is derived from the Greek / Greek word ἴσος, which means equal
 yah maanate hue ki sanghathan kaa bhinn bhashaaon main bhinn sankshipti banegi, yah tay kiya ki ek sarvyaapee sarvamaanya naam ISO hi chalaaya jaae
 This in itself proves the purpose of this organization
 ISO ke mukhya utpaada hai anterrashtriya maanak
 Only published by ISO are: Technical Reports, Technical Specialization, Publicly Available Specialties, Technical Corrigendum, and and Guide
 anterrashtriya maanak kaa roopakar hota he ISO xxrep 5 n sheershak, jahaan xxrep 5 n he maanak sankhya, xxrep 4 y he prakaashan kaa varsh, evam sheershak bataata he vishay
 yadi maanak sanyukt takneekee samiti JTC1 ke kaary kaa parinaam he, to IEC bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 ASTM is also incorporated into standards developed in collaboration with ASTM International
 dinaak evam IS kaa prayog apurna yaa aprakashit maanakon ke liye aprayogneey he, evam kuch paristhitiyon main prakashit kaary kaa sheershak bhi chhona ja saktaa he
 a technical report is issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has generally collected data of a different type from the published international standard, such as references or interpretations
 inaki namakaran pratha maanakon kii bhaanti hi he, keval TR lagaaya jaataa he IS ke sthaan par, report ke naam se pehle
 For example takneekee vishesheekaran ko tab rachit kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki "sambandhit vishay abhi bhi vikaas kii sthiti main hi he, yaa kisi anya karanvash bhavishya main kisi anterrashtriya maanak ko prakashit karne kii sahmati kii sambhaavna hoti he" 
 Publicly available specialties can be an "intermediate specialization that has been published prior to the development of the full international standard", or, a 'bicameral' publication in the IEC, published in collaboration with an external organization
 " Naming is done like a technical report
 udhaahrantah ISO sometimes also issues technical / technical corrigendum
 ye vartmaan maanakon ke sanshodhan hote hai, jo ki kshudra takneekee / paribhaashik trutiyon, prayogneeyata sudhaar yaa simit tareeke se prayojyata badhaane hetu kiye jate hai

 These are named in the "ISO Guide N: xxrep 4 y : title", eg ISO pralekh prakashnadhikaar surakshit hote hai, evam ISO adhiktar kii pratiyon kaa mulya letaa he
 However, most of the values are taken only in electronic form

 Some standards are provided free of charge by ISO and its official United States Representative and International Electrotechnical Commission
 ISO ke 157 rashtriya sadsy hai, out of the 195 total countries in the world
 ISO has three membership categories: bhagidaar sadsy "P" yaa pi sadsy kehalaate hai, jabaki anupaalan karne vaale "O" yaa o sadsy kehalaate hai
 The fact that many iso-created standards are universal, ubiquitous; On many occasions, the general use of "ISO" has been inspired to describe a product that conforms to the standards
 iske kai udhaaharan hai: To deal with the consequences of abundant coverage in the areas of standardization, and the tasks related to information technology; a Joint Technical Committee constituted from ISO & IEC or International Electrotechnical Commission known as ISO / IEC JTC1

 ek sadsy yaa to bhagidaar yaa prekshak ho saktaa he
 The only difference between the proposed standards and other products is the ability to vote
 kisi sadsy sanstha ke liye kisi yaa prayek up-samiti par str / raay banaae rakhane kii, koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Occasionally, sub-committees may be formed, or even dissolved, to cope with new situations if their area of work is no longer in force
 ISO / TS jaise, antarrashtriya kaaryshaala samjhauta International Workshop Agreement bhi ISO kaa ek or shastraagaar he, jo ki un kshetron main, jahaan takneekee sanrachana evam nipunata abhi nahin pahaunchi he; vahaan maanakeekaran kii aavashyaktaaon par twarit pratikriya uplabdh karaata he
