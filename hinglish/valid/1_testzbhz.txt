 inhone betaar ke sanket bhejne main asaadhaaran pragati kii or sabase pehle radio sandeshon ko pakadaney ke liye ardhchalkon kaa prayog karnaa shuru kiya
 But instead of profiting commercially from his discoveries, he published them publicly so that other researchers could work on them further
 iske baad inhone vanaspati jeevaidya main anek khojein kii
 He invented a machine crescograph and studied the response of plants to various stimulants
 is tarah se inhone siddh kiya ki vanaspatiyon or pashuon ke utakon main kaaphi samanta he

 In the year 1885, he returned home and started teaching in Presidency College as Assistant Professor of Physics
 yahaan vah 1915 tak rahe
 At that time, Indian teachers were paid one third of the salary of British teachers
 iskaa jagadish chandra bose ne virodh kiya or bina vetan ke teen varshon tak kaam karte rahe, jisaki vajah se unki stithi kharaab ho gai or un par kaaphi karja ho gaya tha
 To repay this debt, he also had to sell his ancestral land
 chauthe varsh jagadish chandra bose kii jeet hui or unhen puraa vetan diya gaya
 Bose was also a good teacher who used large scale scientific demonstrations to teach in the classroom

 British theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves of mathematically diverse wavelengths, but he died in 1879 before his prediction was validated
 british bhautikavid oliver loj maxwell tarangon ke astitv kaa pradarshan 1887-88 main taron ke saath unhen preshit karke kiya
 German physicist Heinrich Hertz experimented with the existence of electromagnetic waves in free space in 1888
 iske baad, loj ne hertz kaa kaam jari rakhaa or june 1894 main ek smaraneey vyaakhyaan diya or use pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya
 Lodge's work attracted the attention of scientists from various countries, including Bose of India
 bose ke microwave anusandhan kaa pehali ullekhneey pahalu yah tha ki unhone tarang dairdhya ko millimetre str par laa diya 
 They understood the loss of long wavelength light waves to study the properties of light
 1893 main, nicola testla ne pehle saarvajanik radio sanchaar kaa pradarshan kiya
 a year later, during a November 1894 public demonstration in Kolkata, Bose used a millimeter range microwave wave to fire ammunition and ring a bell
 leftinent governor sar wiliam maikenji ne kalakatta toun haul main bose kaa pradarshan dekha
 Bose wrote in a Bengali essay, 'invisible Light', "invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc
, so the message can be transmitted through light without wires
 " rus main popov ne aisa hi ek prayog kiya
 Bose's first scientific article "on the polarization of electric rays by double refractory crystals" was sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of the Lodge article
 unka doosraa lekh oktober 1895 main landan kii royal socity ko lard rele dwaara bheja gaya
 In December 1895, the London magazine electrician published Bose's article "on a new electro-polariscope"
 us samay angreji bolne vaali duniya main loj dwaara gadhe gaye shabd 'kohirar' k prayog hertz ke tarang resiver yaa detector ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The electrician immediately commented on Bose's 'coherer'
 
 angreji patrika electrician se uddhrut tippanee he: Bose planned to better his "coherer" but never thought about the patent
 bose ne apane prayog us samay kiye the jab radio ek sampark madhyam ke taur par viksit ho rahaa tha
 Bose's work on radio microwave optics was not related to radio communication, but the improvements he made and the facts he wrote about it influenced other radio inventors
 us daur main 1894 ke ant main guglielmo marconi ek radio system par kaam kar rahe the jo wireles telegraphy ke liye vishith rup dizine kiya ja rahaa tha
 By early 1896, the system was transmitting radio signals far beyond the range indicated by physics
 jagadishchandra bose pehle vaigyanik the jinhone radio tarange detect karne ke liye semiconductor jankshan kaa istemaal kya tha or is paddati main kai microwave components kii khoj kii thi
 After this, there was no research on electromagnetic waves of millimeter length for the next 50 years
 1897 main bose ne landan ke royal institushan main apane millimetre tarango par kiye hue shodh kii varnana di thi
 He used waveguides, horn antennas, die -lectric lenses, different polarizers and semiconductors with frequencies up to 60 ghz - in his research

 He had said that Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose was 60 years ahead of his time
 asal main bose ne hi p - tip or n - tip semiconductor ke astitv kaa purvanumaan kiya tha
 His biggest contribution in the field of biophysics was that he showed that the stimulation of plants is transmitted through the electrical medium and not through the chemical medium
 baad main in daavon ko vaigyanik proyogo ke madhyam se sach sabit kiya gaya tha
 Acharya Bose first studied the effect of microwave on vegetative tissue
 unhone paudhon par badalte hue mausam se hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Along with this, he also studied the effect of chemical inhibitors on plants and the effect of plants on changing temperatures
 alag alag paristhitiyon main cell membrane potential ke badlaav kaa vishleshan karke ve is nattejey par pahunche kii paudhe samvedansheel hote hai ve " dard mahasoos kar sakate hai, sneh anubhav kar sakate hai ityadi "
 Bose did a comparative study of fat response on different metal and plant tissues
 unhone alag alag dhaatuo ko electrical, maikenical, rasinic or thermal tareekon ke mishran se uttejit kiya tha or koshikao or dhaatu kii pratikriya ke samaantaaon ko note kiya tha
 Bose's experiments showed a cyclic fatig reaction in simulated cells and metals
 iske saath hi jivit koshikao or dhaatuo main alag alag tarah ke uttejnaaon ke liye vishesh chakree fatig or recovery rispance kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 Acharya Bose made a graph of the electrical response of changing plants with the changing electrical stimuli, and also showed that when the plants were given poison or anesthetic, their reactions started to work and became zero later
 lekin yah pratikriya zinc dhaatu ne nahin dikhaai jab use oksalik acid ke saath treet kiya gaya
 In 1917 Jagdish Chandra Bose was conferred the title of "knight" and was soon elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London for Physical and Biology

 bhartiya ank pranali ko pashchim ke deshon main hindu-arabi ank pranali ke naam se janaa jaataa he kyonki europea deshon ko is ank pranali kaa gyaan arab desh se praapt hua tha
 Whereas Arabs got this knowledge from India
 bhartiya ank pranali main shunya ko mila kar kul 10 ank hote hai
 The Indian numeral system is the most popular numeral system in the world
 france ke prasiddh ganitagya piyare simon laplas ke anusaar, Devanagari and international forms of Indian numerals are shown below- itihaaskaaron ke anusaar isa purv chauthi shatabdi main bharat main brahmi ankon kaa prachlan tha
 Brahmi numerals have been found in inscriptions found in caves in the Pune and Mumbai regions and in ancient coins found in Uttar Pradesh
 brahmi ankon main dashamalav pranali tathaa shunya kaa prayog nahin hota tha
 According to apocalyptic documents, zero in India, which is the basis of the decimal system, was invented in the first century CE
 kintu bharat main shunya ke avishkaar ke pramanik dastauez paanchavi shatabdi main hi mili hai
 The inscriptions found in Gwalior, dating back to 870 CE, contain signs of zero
 is shilaalekh ko sabhi itihaaskaaron ne ek mat se manyata di he
 With the invention of zero, the practice of the ten digit number system started in India which became the basis of modern number systems prevalent in this world
 isvi san ke saatvin shatabdi main arab ne bhartiya ank pranali kaa abhigrahan kar liya
 Indian numerals in Arabia became known as Gubar numerals and Indian numeral system known as Hindusa numeral system
 hindustan se is ank pranali ke praapt hone ke kaaran hi vahaan ise 'hindusa' naam diya gaya
 According to the chronological account of a scholar named Muhammad ibn Musa al-khwarizmi of Arabia, europe main barahavin shatabdi tak roman ankon kaa prayog hota tha
 The Roman numeral system has only seven digits, expressed by letters
 ye aksharank hai- I, V, X, L, C, d tathaa m 
 Any number is written by subtracting the sum of these digits
 udhaaharan ke liye agar teen likhnaa he to ek kaa chinh teen baar likh diya III
 If eight is to be written, three to the right of five are added by writing the signs of each one and it becomes VIII
 yah pranali itani kathin or uljhi hui he ki jab barahavin shatabdi main europe kaa bhartiya ank pranali se parichay hua to usne use sweekaar hi nahin kiya, apitu ekadam apana liya
 The scientific-industrial revolution that took place in Europe after a few centuries, has contributed to the calculation of Indian numerals
 bharat ne gananaa hetu nau ankon tathaa shunya kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 Not only this, the local value of numbers was also invented in India
 shunya kaa koi maan nahin he kintu use agar ek ank ke dahini ore likh diya jaae to vah das ingit karegaa kyonki ab 1 kaa sthaneey maan das ho gaya
 If one more zero is increased to the right, this number will be hundred
 is tarah ank ke dahini ore likhe jane par moolyaheen shunya, duusare ankon kaa mulya badha detaa he
 In short, the principle of pricing digits by place is called local value
 is pranali se kisi bhi sankhya ko likhnaa bahut aasaan he
 The three hundred forty-four which we write in the Roman system as CCC XL IV, can be written 344 by Indian law
 is madhyam se badi se badi sankhya bina kisi kathinaayee ke sankshep main likhi ja sakati he
 Indian mathematics also invented the decimal system
 bharat main dashamalav ankon kaa sarvapratham prayog aryabhatta pratham dwaara miltaa he
 It is possible that it was invented much earlier
 kint europe main dashamalav ank kaa saamaanya prachaar satrahavin shatabdi main hua, jiskaa gyaan nishchit hi usne bharat se praapt kiya tha
 These Indian mathematical principles were acquired through Europe to Arabia
 arabi bhashaa main in ankon ko hindasa kehete hai
 Hindsa means 'derived from Hind'
 arabi lipi daaen se baayen likhi jaati he, kintu arabi main ank baayen se daayen likhe jate hai
 This is also evidence that Arabic numerals did not originate in the Arab country with the Arabic language, but are imported from outside
 arabon ke madhyam se jab yah bhartiya ank europe pahunche to unh laga ki ye ank mul rup se arabon dwaara hi avishkaar kiye gaye hai
 Therefore, even today, in Europe, the Indian numerals from one to nine and zero are called 'arabic Numericals'
 islam ke paigambar hazrat mohammad ke purv arab desh main jihalia arthath 'agyaan kaa yug' kaha jaataa he
 There was no progress in knowledge science
 puure kurash kabeeley main, jisase mohammad sahab kaa sambandh tha, keval satraa log kuch likhnaa jaanate the
 But with the establishment of Islam, the Arab Empire expanded to the borders of Spain and North Africa in the west and India in the east
 jo desh parajeet hokar arab samrajya main shaamil hue, unke aarthik prashasan ke liye arabi gananaa-pranali, jo ki atyant praarambhik str kii thi, aparyaapt siddh hui
 Therefore, the Arab rulers were forced to use the numbers of the conquered castes
 khalipha al mansoor ke rajyakaal ke samay main sindh se kuch doot baghdad gaye, jinamein kuch vidwaan bhi the
 He also took with him Brahmasputa siddhanta composed by Brahmagupta and a treatise called Khandakhadyaka along with other texts in Baghdad
 in vidwaanon kii sahaayta se al-fajari evam yaqub khan tarik ne inkaa arabi main anuwaad kiya, jiskaa arabi ganit par vishesh prabhaav padaa
 The respect that Arab people had for Indian knowledge, science and art at that time, is written in al-zahij's booklet - Fakir assam-sudan al-lah binad: pisa nagar ke leonado ne, jisane kisi moore se hindu ganit siikhaa or san 1202 main liber evaiki naamak pustak likhi, jiskaa sanshodhit sanskaran san 1228 main aayaa
 In this, he explained Hindu numerals and their utility
 alekjad r de viladi or jaan aak heliphaks kii pustakon ne bhi ‘hindu ank pranali’ kaa prasar kiya
 Initially it was opposed, but by the middle of the fifteenth century it was accepted by all the countries of Europe
 anya european deshon ne bhartiya ank pranali ko arab se siikhaa
 Since they got this numeral system from Arabia, they named it 'arabic numeral system'
 itihaas kaa sahi gyaan hone ke baad ab ise 'hindu-arabic ank' yaa 'hindu ankapranali' yaa 'bhartiya ankapranali' kaha jane laga he
 There have been many changes in the sign of the Indian numeral system from time to time and country to country

 manushya anjaane main hi is tarah ke sanket bhejtaa bhi he or samajhataa bhi he
 It is often said that 93% of human communication consists of body language and trans-linguistic signals, while words make up 7% of total communication through words — but working in this area in the 1960s gave these figures The researcher Albert Mehrabian had said that this is actually a misunderstanding based on the results of his study
 Others emphasized that 'on the basis of research, 60 to 70 percent of the hidden meanings in communication are manifested by non-verbal behavior
 sharir kii bhashaa kisi ke ravaiye or uski manahosthiti ke bare main sanket de sakati he
 For example, it may indicate aggression, mood, boredom, resting state, happiness, entertainment, and many other emotions
 logon ko padhane kii takanic aksar prayog kii jaati he
 For example, during an interview it is usually done to reflect body language to get people in a relaxed state
 kisi kii shaareerik bhashaa ko pratibimbit karnaa is baat kii taraf sanket detaa he ki uski baat samajhi ja rahi he
 The body language signal may have a different goal than communication
 donon hi logon ko ye baat dhyaan main rakhni hogi
 paryvekshak amaukhik sanketon ko kitna mahatv dete hai ye wo swayan nirdhaarit karte hai
 Indicators demonstrate the biological origin of their actions by clarifying their signals
 shaareerik abhivyaktiyaan jaise ki haath hilaanaa, ungali se ishaara karnaa, choona or nazar neeche karke dekhnaa ye sabhi amaukhik sanchaar ke rup hai
 The study of the movement and expression of the body is called kinesics or dynamics
 jab manushya kuch kahata he to saath hi apane sharir ko gati detaa he kyonki jaisaa ki shodhakartaaon ne pradarshit kiya he, isse 'sanchaar ke kathin hone par bhi baat kehane or samajhane ke liye maansik prayaas ko madad milti he
 'body expressions reveal many things about the person who is using them
 udhaaharan ke liye, ishaaron dwaara kisi khaas bindu par bal diya ja saktaa he yaa ek sandesh ko aage badhaaya ja saktaa he, asana sanchaar main aapaki ub yaa ruchi ko pradarshit kar saktaa he or sparsh protsaahan yaa chetavanee jaise bhav prakat kar saktaa he
 It should be noted that some people understand and use body language somewhat differently or at times do not understand or use it at all
 If their gestures and facial expressions are interpreted according to normal body language, many times misunderstandings and misinterpretations are made
 It should also be mentioned that people from different cultures can interpret body language in different ways
 shaareerik bhashaa amaukhik sanchaar kaa ek rup he jisamen kisi vishesh style ke ishaare, asana or shaareerik chinh dusron ke liye sanket kii tarah kaary karte hai
 Man sometimes inadvertently exchanges non-verbal signals all the time
 kuch shodhakartaaon ne kul sanchaar main amaukhik sanchaar ko 80 pratishat jitne bade hisse kaa daavedaar mana he jabaki ho saktaa he ki ye 50-65 pratishat tak hi ho
 vibhinn adhyayanon se alag-alag mahatv kaa hona paaya gaya he jinamein se kuch se pataa chalata he ki praayah sanchaar chehre ke bhaavon ke zariye hi kar liya jaataa he yani boli gai baton kii tulana ke 4
3 guna avasaron par chehre ke bhav hi sanchaar kaa madhyam banate hai
 According to another study, the words spoken in a flat sound can be understood four times better than any pure facial expression
 albert mehrabian 7% -38% -55% kaa ek niyam khojane ke liye jane jate hai jo ki ye pradarshit karata he ki kramshah shabd, swar or shaareerik bhashaa kaa kul sanchaar main kitna yogadan he
 However, he was referring only to such cases where such expressions or attitudes are expressed in which a person is saying 'I have no problem with you!' When people usually pay attention to the tone of voice and body language rather than what is said
 It is a common misconception that all these percentages apply to all types of communication

 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 ardhasuthran ek vishesh prakaar kaa koshika vibhaajan he jo eukariot praaniyon main langig janan ke liye aavashyak he
 The gametes cells are produced by meiosis
 sabhi jantuon tathaa bhoomi par ugane vaale paudhon sahit adhikansh jeevadhariyon main yugmakon ko and koshika tathaa shukranu koshika kehete hai
 Although there are many similarities between the process of meiosis and the process of meiosis, meiosis differs from meiosis in two important aspects - jin praaniyon main dwilangik prajnan kii kriya prachlit he, unamem pranijivan ek sansechit andey se aarambh hota he
 In the process of impregnation, the nucleus of the egg and the nucleus of the sperm form and become zygotic
 'sayujya' kaa arth yah he ki anuvaanshik padaarth yugmaj main dvigun ho gaya, kyonki yah padaarth ek maatra main andey main tha or ek maatra main shukranu main
 It is clear that the genetic material will not double in each generation
 sansechanvidhi main anuvanshik padaarth main anivaary dvigunan kii kriya is prakaar hoti he ki langik koshikaon kaa paripakvatavibhaajan ke samay gunasutron kii sankhya aadhi ho jaati he
 This is a minimal division, that is, after this division the number of chromosomes is halved
 ardhasuthran kii purvavastha saadhaaran samasutran kii purvavastha kii apeksha adhik samay tak sthir rahati he or kai upavasthaon main vibhajit kii ja sakati hai
 These conditions are: leptotene, zygotein, packitin, diplotine tathaa dyakinisis 
 In the leptotene stage the nucleus is found to be filled with long and thin chromosomes
 in sutron par kahin kahi kanikas pai jaati hai, jinako chromomier kehete hai
 The parts of chromosomes between chromomers are called inter chromomeric fibrils
 introchromomeric fibrili kii apeksha chromomier main abhiranjit hone kii adhik kshamta hoti he
 The zygotene epitope contains the coupling of chromosomes
 langik gunasutron ke atirikt jeev ke cendrak main gunasutron ke do ekaatmak kulak hote hai
 a kulak has many chromosomes, which are generally different from each other
 iskaa arth yah he ki prayek prakaar ke do gunasutra hote hai
 As stated above, the coupling of chromosomes occurs in the zygote subfamily
 yugman kii kriya kramahin rup main nahin hoti, varan bahut krambaddh hoti he
 This action occurs only between identical chromosomes
 prayek gunasutra apane samaan sutara ke saath ek sire se duusare sire tak jud jaataa he or jude hue sutron ke chromomier keval apane samaan chromomier se hi judate hai
 By the end of the zygotene phase, the coupling is complete
 saathi gunasutra ek duusare ke itane adhik sameep hote hai ki ve ek prathit hote he
 Such pairs of chromosomes are called bisectors
 packitin upavastha main prayek dwisanyojak ke yugmit sutara ek duusare ke itane sameep hote hai ki purna dwisanyojak dekhne main ek sutara prathit hota he
 Due to spiral condensation in the packetin time, the divalents become smaller and in the diplotene and diakinisis time the divalents become even smaller
 diplotine upavastha main ek dwisanyojak ke donon sutron main se prayek sutara do do sutron main vibhajit ho jaataa he
 The result is that each divisor is found to be composed of two pair coupled formulas
 ek gunasutra ke vibhaajan se utpann do sutron ko ardhasutra kehete hai
 In the diplotene state, these paired formulas diverge from each other, but in some places they do not separate from each other
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki prayek paksh kaa ek ardhasutra jagah jagah par tut jaataa he or phir abhimukh paksh ke toote hue ek ardhasutra ke donon khandon se iske khand jute jate hai
 In the diplotene stage, the couple semicircles are adjacent to each other and are clearly away from the opposing pair semicircles, but due to the above phenomenon in place, a semicircle appears to be contiguous with the semicircle of the opposite side, leaving its pair semicircular
 aisi sanrachanaon ko kiazmeta kehete hai
 Because of the thicker and shorter formulas, the correlation of the semicircles in diakinisis cannot be readily observed, and in the mid-term, the chromosomes undergo ground condensation, thereby estimating the presence of azimata
 yadhyapi ardhasuthran kii purvavastha se pehle hi prayek gunasutra kaa vibhaajan ho jaataa he, tathaapi inke centromear kaa vibhaajan madhyavastha tak bhi nahin hota
 For this reason, even when divided, the privacy of each chromosome remains
 pashchaavastha me prayek gunasutra apane saathi se alag ho jaataa he, arthath prayek dwisanyojak ke donon gunasutron kaa vighatan ho jaataa he or yugmit gunasutron main se ki si dhruv kii ore jaataa he or doosraa uske viruddh dhruv kii ore
 It is clear from this description that only half the chromosomes reach each pole
 antaraal avasthaa bahut hi alpakaaleen hoti he or kuch jantuon main to hoti hi nahin
 At the end of the interstellar stage, then the precursor begins
 madhyavastha, uske pashchaat tathaa antyavastha kaa kram vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa saadhaaran samasutran main
 It has been said above that in meiosis, cell division occurs one after the other, twice
 is prakaar donon koshikavibhaajan kii avasthaaon kaa pruthak pruthak nirdisht karne ke liye unka madhyavastha-1, madhyavastha-2, antyavastha-1, antyavastha-2 ityadi kehete hai
 It has been said above that every chromosome gets divided into two semicircles from its predecessor, but its centromere remains undivided
 isaliye madhyavastha-2 par gunasutra centromear ko chhodkar purnroop se vibhajit hota he
 At the beginning of the posterior phase, the centromere divides into two parts, as a result of which both parts of the chromosome break free from each other and can move towards the opposite pole
 langik gunasutra vishesh gunasutra hote hai, jo ek ling main yugmit hote hai parantu duusare main nahi; jaise drosophila melanogaster main saadhaaran gunasutron ke teen jode hote hai, jinako aaling sutara kehete hai or do langik gunasutra hote hai
 In the female, both sex chromosomes are identical
 inhen ya-gunasutra kehete hai
 Males also have two sex chromosomes
 ek ya-gunasutra hota he, jo har maadaa ya-gunasutra ke samaan hota he, parantu doosraa ya-gunasutra se bhinn hota he
 This is called the R-chromosome
 maadaa main ardhasuthran ke ant main prayek koshika main chaar gunasutra hote hai-teen aalingsutra or ek ya-gunasutra
 Each oocyte is divided twice
 isse chaar koshikaaye utpann hoti hai
 Out of these, there are three polar bodies, which soon perish and are a mature egg
 maadaa kii bhanti nar main prayek shukrakoshika do baar vibhajit hoti he, jisase chaar sparmatid utpann hote hai
 These spermatids are of two types
 ek main teen aaling sutara or ek ya-gunasutra hota he or duusare main teen aaling sutara or ek r-gunasutra hota he
 It is clear that spermatids are of two types, but the egg is of the same type
 prayek sparmatid kramash: lanbaa or patala ho jaataa he
 This is called spermatozoan
 sansechan main ek sparmatozoon kaa sir ek andanu main pravesh karata he
 The accumulated egg is called zygote and since there are two types of sperm, so zygote is also of two types
 ek shrenee kaa yugmaj maadaa hota he or duusari shrenee kaa nar
 It also happens that the female has two Y-chromosomes and the male has only one Y-chromosome
 aisi dasha main linganirnay usee bhanti hota he jaise bhanti hota he jaise drosophila melano-gastor main
 Two types of sperm are produced in the male's body - one has a Y-chromosome in addition to the cuddling formula and the other has no Y-chromosome
 aise bhi jantu hai jinke nar main paraspar bhinn kai ya-gunasutra hote hai
 Two types of spermatids are formed at the end of meiosis
 ek prakaar ke sparmatid main aalingsutra ke atirikt ya1, ya2, ya3 ityadi gunasutra hote hai or duusare main keval r-gunasutra or aalingsutra

 The temple of Kalki avatar was built in 1739 AD in the Dakshinayan Shikhara style, based on the legend mentioned in Puranas by Sawai Jaisingh, the founder of Jaipur
 prakhyat sanskrit vidwaan devarshi kalanath shastri ke anusaar, "savai jaisingh sansar ke aise pehle maharaja rahe hai, jinhone jis devtaa kaa abhi tak avatar hua hi nahin, uske bare main purv-kalpana kar kalki kii murti banavaa kar ek alag mandir main sthapit karaayi
 Sawai Jaisingh's contemporary poet Sri Krishna Bhatt Kalanidhi has described the construction and justification of the temple in his Ishwara Vilas poetry

 After Ali, his eldest son Hasan was to become Khalifa

 He wanted the throne of Khilafat fighting Hassan Alaihisslam

 or islamki raksha hetu veerta purvak ladate hue shahid ho gayi
 According to the treaty with Mu'awiya, after Mu'awiya's death, Hassan Alaihissalam would again be succeeded by his younger brother Hussein Alaheisslam Khalifa, but Mu'awiya did not like it either
 usne hossain alehisslam ko khilaafat dene se manaa kar diya
 Mu'awiya died the last 6 months before its ten-year term

 Vikram's classes last approximately 90 minutes and are completed by a set of 26 postures and a series of 2 breath exercises
 vikram yoga kaa abhyaas adarsh rup se 105° fahrenheit tak garm kiye gaye or 40% ardrata vaale kamare main karaayaa jaataa he jo ise khule taur par hot yoga ke ek swaroop main pahchaan dilaataa he
 Vikram Yoga aims to maintain normal well-being and Vikram Chaudhary claims that the heated studio facilitates deep stretches and protection from injury, reducing stress and fatigue
 vikram kaa daawa he ki unki pranali sharir kii prayek mansapeshi, jod or ang ko utprerit karti he or tandoorusti jagaati he
 According to Mr
 Chaudhary, many people are able to use only up to 50 percent of their lung capacity, and thus the lungs must be dilated compulsorily in order to maintain higher oxygen content
 2007 ke ek saakshaatkaar main shri choudhary ne kaha tha ki jab koi vyakti pranayam kaa abhyaas kar rahaa hota he use antat oxigen ke roopantaran or avasorana ko badhaane ke saath-saath rakt parisancharan main sudhaar ke liye sakasham hona chahie, jaisaa ki hridayavahini gatividhiyon ke kai anya swaroopon main hota he
 Mr
 Chaudhary claims that during Vikram Yoga, blood circulation is severely affected due to two processes called extension and compression
 kaha jaataa he ki ye donon prakriyaayein ek saath milakar kaam karti hai jisase maanav sharir ke andar prayek jod, mansapeshi or ang ko taaja oxigen praapt hota he
 While practicing a specific posture, the practitioner stretches and shrinks a particular part of the body, thus stopping circulation temporarily
 parisancharan main is rukaawat ke kaaran hriday ko us kami kii pratikriya swaroop adhik rakt pump karnaa padataa he
 The process of pumping excess fresh blood is called extension
 ek baar jab asana puraa ho jaataa he or vyakti us mudra se baahar aa jaataa he, to un dhamniyon main nayaa oxigen yukt rakt phir se sanchaarit hone lagata he jahaan ise sankuchit kiya ja rahaa tha
 Due to changes in fresh blood volume and its rapid flow, it is said that infections, bacteria and harmful substances can be removed through this process

 Vikram Yoga has been the subject of much controversy over the question whether it is safe to practice hard exercises in rooms with temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit
 vikram yoga kaa abhyaas karne waalon ke liye chakkar aana or matlee kaa anubhav karnaa aam baat he
 Another controversial aspect of Vikram Yoga concerns the spread of Vikram competitions at regional and national levels
 jabaki yoga ke anya swaroopon ke abhyaasakartaaon kaa kahana he ki pratispardhaa shanti or ekta ke vichaar kaa virodh karnaa he, vikram kaa kahana he, "pratispardhaa har loktantric samaaj kaa aadhaar he
 No democracy is maintained without 'competition'
 " In the United States, Mr
