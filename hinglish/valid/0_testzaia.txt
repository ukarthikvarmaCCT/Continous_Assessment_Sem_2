 Loans were made in lieu of opium, indigo, salt, woolen cloth, cotton, cotton yarn, spinning machine and silk goods, etc
 But the boom in finance through cash loans started only from the third decade of the nineteenth century

 There were significant changes in the terms of operation of the Bank of Bengal, Bombay and Madras after 1860
 1861 ke paper karency act ke paarit ho jane se presidency bainkon kaa mudra jari karne kaa adhikaar samaapt kar diya gaya tathaa 1 march 1862 se britain shasit bharat main kaagazi mudra jari karne kaa mul adhikaar bharat sarkaar ko praapt ho gaya
 The responsibility of managing and operating the new paper currency was entrusted to the Presidency Banks and the Government of India took the responsibility of transferring deposits in the treasury to the banks where the banks would open their branches
 tab tak teenon presidency bainkon kii koi shakha nahin thi jabaki unke samvidhan ke antargat unhen yah adhikaar praapt tha
 But as soon as the three presidency banks got assurance of using the deposits in the treasury without interruption, they started to open branches of the bank at those places rapidly
 san 1876 tak teenon presidency bainkon kii shakhaayen, abhikaran va up-abhikaranon ne desh ke pramukh kshetron tathaa bharat ke bhitari bhaagon main sthit vyapaar kendro main apana vistaar kar liya
 Bank of Bengal had 18 branches including its headquarters, temporary branches, and sub-agencies while Bank of Bombay and Madras each had 15 branches
 1 may 1876 se lagu presidency banks act ke dwaara vyavsaay par ekasmaan pratibandhon ke saath teen presidency bainkon ko ek samaan kanoon ke antargat laayaa gaya
 However, the ownership relationship of the government was terminated despite the banks having custody of public debt offices in three presidency towns and a portion of government deposits
 is act dwaara kalakatta, bombai evam madras main teen arakshit koshon ke srijan kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya jahaan presidency bainkon ko keval unke pradhan karyaalayon main rakhane ke liye nirdhaarit nunatam raashi se adhik kii jamaarashiyaan rakhi jaati thim
 The government could lend to the presidency banks from these reserve funds, but these banks saw it as a grace rather than a right

 Despite the slow pace of expansion in the last decade, there has been a steady increase in the case of Bank of Madras, as the bank benefited mainly from the trade between several cities adjoining the port of the Presidency and the inner centers of the country
 used to have

 Due to tea and coffee plantations, large areas of the eastern Terai, Assam and Nilgiris Mountains were transformed into excellent real estate

 The three presidency banks were both beneficiaries and promoters of this process of commercialization as they became practically involved in financing every business, manufacturing and quarrying activity of the sub-continent
 bengal evam bombai ke bank bade aadhunik vinirmaan udyogon ke vittaposhan main lage the, jabaki bank of madras laghu udyogon kaa vittaposhan karne laga jaise anyatra kahin bhi hota nahin tha
 But these three banks were kept away from any foreign exchange related business

 Till the formation of Reserve Bank of India in the year 1935, these banks were kept away from this business
 bengal, bombai evam madras ke presidency bainkon ko unki 70 shakhaon ke saath varsh 1921 main vilyan kar imperial bank of india kii sthapana kii gai
 These three banks were transformed into a joint entity and a large bank emerged among Indian commercial banks

 But behind this formation was a discussion on the need of the State Bank of India for years

 With the formation of the Reserve Bank of India as the central bank of India in 1935, the role of the semi-central bank of the Imperial Bank came to an end
 imperial bank bharat sarkaar kaa bank na rahakar aise kendron main jahaan kendriya bank nahin he, sarkari vyavsaay ke nishpaadan ke liye bhartiya reserve bank kaa agent ban gaya
 But it continued to operate the depots of currency chests and small coins and to operate the Remittance Facility Scheme for other banks and the public on the terms set by the Reserve Bank of India
 vah bankeron kaa atirikt nakad apane paas rakhkar tathaa praadhikrut pratibhuti par unhen rin dekar unke bank ke rup main bhi kaary karne laga
 The bank also managed clearing houses at many places where the Reserve Bank of India did not have offices
 yah bank sarkaar kii taraf se reserve bank dwaara yojit rajkoshiya bill nilaamiyon main sabase bada nividakarta bhi rahaa
 After the establishment of the Reserve Bank, important amendments were made to its constitution to convert the Imperial Bank into a commercial bank
 uske vyavsaay par purv main lagaae gaye pratibandhon ko hataaya gaya tathaa pehali baar bank ko videshi mudra vyavsaay karne tathaa nishpadak evam nyaasi vyavsaay karne kii anumati di gai
 The Imperial Bank has recorded very impressive growth in the form of offices, reserves, deposits, investments and advances during the three and a half decades since its existence
 kuch maamalon main yah vruddhi chah guna se bhi adhik rahi
 The financial position and security inherited from the predecessors unambiguously provided the bank a solid and robust platform

 Mathematicians are generally interested in the description and discovery of mathematics patterns and in finding proofs of theorems
 Most theorems and problems come from mathematics itself or are inspired by theoretical physics
 To some extent, the problems of mathematics have come from economics, sports and computer science
 Some difficult questions are posed only so that it can be a challenge to solve
 Although a lot of mathematics is not immediately useful, but history shows
 That the applications of mathematics come to know later

 Among theistic philosophers, Vedanta, Yoga philosophy and mythology clearly adopt the Trinitarianism and Chikism of Sankhya 
 is prakaar kapil pravartit sankhya kaa prabhaav praaia: sabhi darshanon par padaa he
 There has been controversy and research on what Kapil preached
 tatvasamasasutra ko uske tikaakar kapil dwaara rachit maanate hai
 The formulas are short and simple
 isiilie maxmooler ne unhen bahut pracheen batalaaya
 In the 8th century Jain text 'bhagavadjukkiyam', mentioning Sankhya is said - 'tatvasamasasutra' main bhi aisa hi paath miltaa he
 At the same time, commentator Bhavaganesh of Tattvasamasutra says that while writing the commentary, he has taken help from the Panchshikh written commentary
 richard garvey ke anusaar panchasikh kaa kaal pratham shatabdi kaa hona chahie
 Therefore, if we consider the commentary of Bhagavajujyakam and Bhavaganesh, the period of 'tattvamasasutra' can be taken till the first century of Christ
 iske purv isaki sthiti ke liye sabal pramaan kaa abhaav he
 Some commentators also consider the Sankhyaprakshasutra to be Kapil's work
 kaumudiprabha ke karta swapneshwar 'sankhyapravachansutra' ko panchasikh kii kriti maanate hai or kehete hai ki yah granth kapil dwaara nirmit isliye mana gaya he ki kapil sankhya ke pravartak hai
 The same thing can be said about 'tattvasamas'
 parantu sankhyapravachansutra kaa vivaran madhav ke 'sarvadarshansangrah' main nahin he or na to gunratn main hi iske aadhaar par sankhya kaa vivaran diya he
 Hence, scholars consider it to be a 14th century treatise
 lekin gita main inkaa zikr aane se ye or pracheen lagate hai
 Their time and place of birth cannot be decided
 bahut se vidwaanon ko to inaki aitihaasikta main hi andeh he
 They are mentioned in the Puranas and Mahabharata
 kaha jaataa he, prayek kalp ke aadi main kapil janm lete hai
 He attains all the accomplishments with birth
 isiilie inako adisiddh or adividvan kaha jaataa he
 His disciple has been described as a yearly Shrotriya Brahmin born in a dynasty called Asuri
 parampara ke anusaar ukt asuri ko nirmaanchitt main adhishthit hokar inhone tatvagyan kaa upadesh diya tha
 Nirmanichitta means to make one's mind voluntarily by accomplishment
 isse maaloom hota he, kapil ne asuri ke saamne saakshaat upasthit hokar upadesh nahin diya apitu asuri ke gyaan main inke pratipaadit siddhanton kaa sphuran hua, at: ye 'asuri' ke guru kehalaae
 In the Mahabharata, he has been called the speaker of Sankhya
 inako agni kaa avatar or brahma kaa manasaputra bhi puraanon main kaha gaya he
 According to Srimad Bhagwat, Kapil is considered the fifth avatar of Vishnu
 kardam or devhooti se inaki utpatti maani gai he
 Later he preached Sankhya Gyan to his mother Devahuti, whose detailed description is found in the third wing of Srimad Bhagwat
 kapilwastu, jahaan buddha paidaa hue the, kapil ke naam par basaa nagar tha or sagar ke putr ne sagar ke kinare kapil ko dekha or unka shaap paaya tathaa baad main vahiin ganga kaa sagar ke saath sangam hua
 This suggests that Kapil's birthplace was probably Kapilavastu and austerity Gangasagar
 isse kam-se-kam itnaa to avashya kah sakate hai ki buddha ke pehle kapil kaa naam fail chukaa tha
 If we consider the centipede of Kapil's disciple, Asuri, as integral to the Brahmin's asuri, we can say that Kapil's position must have been at least in the Brahmin period
 is prakaar 700 varsh i
pus
 kapil kaa kaal mana ja saktaa he
 The aim of Sankhya Shastra is to attain salvation through philosophy
 brahman granthon main yagyakarm ke dwaara apvarg kii prapti batalaai gai he
 The greatest feature of Sankhya is to give importance to Jnanakanda as opposed to ritual
 upanishdon main gyaan ko karm se shreshth mana gaya he
 Although in most of the Upanishads, Brahma has been described as an extreme entity and the world as the result or converse; In some Upanishads, however, the principles of Samkhya are mainly represented
 parantu yah pratipaadan krambaddh rup main nahin he, keval kuch aise siddhanton kii ore sanket karata he jiskaa aage chalakar sankhya siddhant main samavesh ho gaya
 The meaning of calling Kapil as Adisiddh or Siddhesh is that it was probably Kapil who first showed the path of meditation and penance
 unke pehle karm hi ek maarg tha or gyaan keval charchaa tak simit tha
 By giving knowledge as a form of spiritual practice, Kapil distinguished sacrifice, penance and samadhi for the first time in Indian culture
 sankhya main prakruti or purush ye do tatv maane gaye hai
 Nature is said to be made up of these three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas
 trigun kii samyavastha, prakruti or inke vaishamy se sristi hoti he
 There is nothing new in the universe, everything originates from nature
 sansar prakruti kaa parinaam maatr he
 Sankhya has fame as a promoter of hospitality and consequentialism
 purush ke sannidhi maatr se prakruti main vaishamy hone se sristi hoti he
 Nature is the root - Purusha is the conscious, Prakriti is the doer - Purusha is passive
 langade or andhe ke sanyog kii tarah purush or prakruti kaa sanyog he
 The man is conscious and seeing his image in nature, considers himself to be the doer and suffers from this ignorance in the bond of ignorance, attains fascination
 jis samay purush ko gyaan ho jaataa he ki vah karta nahin he, nirlypt, kutasth sakshi maatr he, prakruti kaa naatay uske liye samaapt ho jaataa he
 To be free from ignorant bondage and to know one's own form is Kaivalya or Moksha and this is the ultimate effort
 mukt hone par mukt purush ke liye prakruti mahatvaheen he parantu anya sansari purush ke liye vah satya he kyonki prakruti kaa naash nahin hota
 This is the reason why Nana is considered a male in Sankhya
 puraanon tathaa 'sankhyapravachansutra' ke anusaar purushon ke upar ek purushottam bhi mana gaya he
 It gives salvation to Purushottam or God Purush
 parantu pracheenatam uplabdh sankhya granth 'sankhyakarika' ke anusaar ishwar ko sankhya main sthaan nahin he
 Apparently Kapil was also a naturalist, Sesvara Samkhya developed later
 sankhya main pachis tatv maane gaye hai
 Purusha, the purified nature of man, arises out of importance or intelligence, intelligence from ego, ego from five tantras or subtle ghosts and mind, from five tantras, five gyan senses, five karmadriyas and five macros are generated
 inamen se prakruti kisi se utpann nahin he, mahat ahankaar or tanmatraayen, ye saat prakruti se utpann hai or duusare tatwon ko utpann bhi karte hai
 The remaining sixteen elements are only generated, do not give birth to any new element
 at: ye solah vikaar maane jate hai, prakruti avikari he, mahat aadi saat tatv swayan vikari hai or vikaar utpann bhi karte hai

 The film's creator, Duncan Kenwardy, then turned to Röger Mitchell and said "finding the perfect person like Rauger was just like finding the right actors to play each character
 Raugher is perfect
" " Curtis chose Notting Hill for the setting of this film because he lived there and knew the place well
 bakaul curtis "notting hill ek melting pot or ek film ke liye umdaa jagah he
 "this created a problem for producers to make a film in a densely populated area
 Kenwardi mentioned" Initially we thought of making a huge external set

" akhirkaar unhone yah jokhim uthaane kaa or asal sadakon par hi film banane kaa faisla kiya
 Mitchell was concerned that "hugh and Julia were to arrive on Portobello Road on the first day of shooting and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and photographers with yellow journalism who would not let us shoot
" The location team and security staff prevented this from happening and the troubles of the film crew from the residents of Notting Hill, who were "really excited" about the film

 The film features a painting by Mark Chagall called La Marie in 1950
 kahani main, anna us painting kii ek print prati wiliam ke ghar par dekhati he or baad main use anumaanatah mul bhent karti he
 According to an article published in Director Mitchell's Entertainment Weekly, the painting was chosen because screenwriter Curtis was an admirer of Chagall's works and since La Marie "shows a longing for something that has been lost"
 The producers rebuilt it for use in the film, but for this they had to get permission from the owner of the first painting as well as the British Design and Artist Copyright Society
 Ultimately, according to producer Kenwardy "we had to agree to destroy it
 They were worried that if our copying became too good, it would spread to the market and create problems
" That article also mentioned that "according to some experts the real canvas could have cost between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million
 " The music of the film was given by Trevor Jones
