 prakaashiki main, unhone pehla vyavhaarik paravarti doordarshee banaaya or is aadhaar par rang kaa siddhant viksit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko kai rangon main apaghatit kar detaa he jo drishy spectrum banaate hai
 He gave the rule of cooling and studied the speed of sound

 He also demonstrated the generalized binomial theorem and developed the so-called "newton's method" for the approximation of zeros of a function and contributed to the study of power series

 Newton was found to be more effective in this survey

 Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643, old style and new style dates | OS]]: 25 December 1642] in Woolsthorpe Manor in woolsthorpe-by-kolsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire
 newton ke janm ke samay, england ne grigorian calendar ko nahin apanaaya tha or isliye unke janm kii tithi ko christmas diwas 25 disambar1642 ke rup main darj kiya gaya
 Newton was born three months after his father's death, he was a prosperous farmer and his name was Isaac Newton
 purv paripakv avasthaa main paidaa hone vaala vah ek chota balak tha; unki mata hanna askf kaa kahana tha ki vah ek chauthai gaylen jaise chote se mag main samaa saktaa tha
 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her
 jaisaa ki 19 varsh tak kii aayu main unke dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon kii suchi main pradarshit hota he: "maine mata or pita smith ke ghar ko jalaane kii dhamkee di
" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers
 vah kheti se nafrat karte the
 Master Henry Stokes of King's School asked his mother to send him back to school so that he could complete his education
 skool ke ek ladke ke khilaaf badla lene kii ichha se prerit hone kii vajah se ve ek sheersh kram ke chaatr ban gaye
 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role
 us samay college kii shikshaayen arastu par aadhaarit thim
 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa
 a study by the Royal Society of Newton declared that Newton was the true inventor and that Leibniz had committed fraud
 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations
 did
 unhone laghuganak ke dwaara haraatmak shredhi ke aanshik yoga kaa sanniktan kiya, or ve pehle vyakti the jinhone aatmavishvaas ke saath ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa vilom kiya
 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton again began his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years
 unhone us prabhaav ke liye latin shabd gravitas kaa istemaal kiya jise gurutv ke naam se janaa jaataa he or saarvatrik gurutvkarshan ke niyam ko paribhaashit kiya
 In this work, he presented the first analytical proof of the speed of sound in air, based on Boyle's law
 bahut adhik duuri par kriya kar sakane vaale ek adrishy bal kii newton kii avadharana kii vajah se unki aalochana hui, kyonki unhone vigyaan main "gupt agenciyon" ko mila diya tha
 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views
 unhone ek pandulipi jon loke ko bheji jisamen unhone trinity ke astitv ko vivaadit mana tha, jise kabhi prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window
 1696 main newton shahi taksaal ke warden kaa pad sanbhaalane ke liye landan chale gaye, yah pad unhen rajkosh ke tatkaaleen kuladhipati, helifax ke pehle arl, charles montagu ke sangrakshan ke madhyam se praapt hua
 He took over as the chief currency mover of England, somehow dancing at the behest of Master Lucas
 1699 main lucas kii mrityu newton shaayad taksaal ke sabase prasiddh master bane, is pad par newton apni mrityu tak bane rahe

 In "la of Queen Anne" as master of the mint in 1717, Newton inadvertently established the pound sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard, establishing a metallic relationship between silver money and gold coins in favor of gold
 Changed
 is kaaran se chaandi sterling sikke ko pighla kar britain se baahar bhej diya gaya
 Newton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Academic des Sciences
 royal sosayadi main apane pad par rahete hue, newton ne royal khagolvid jon flemustid ko shatru bana liya, unhone flemustid kii historica cholestis britanika ko samay se pehle hi prakashit karvaa diya, jise newton ne apane adhyayan main kaam main liya tha
 In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit at Trinity College, Cambridge
 yah nite kii padavi newton ko taksaal ke master ke rup main apni sevaao ke liye nahin di gayi thi or na hi unke vaigyanik kaary ke liye di gayi thi balki unhen yah oopaadhi may 1705 main sansadeey chunaav ke dauraan unke rajanithik yogadan ke liye di gayi thi
 Newton died in London on 31 March 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey
 unki aadhi-bhatiji, catherine barton konduit, ne landan main jarmin street main unke ghar par saamaajik maamalon main unki paricharika kaa kaam kiya; ve uske "bahut pyaare ankal" the, aisa zikr unke us patr main kiya gaya he jo newton ke dwaara use tab likhaa gaya jab vah chechak kii beemaari se ubar rahi thi
 In his final years, Newton, who had no children, took over most of his property by his relatives and died intestate
 unki mrityu ke baad, newton ke sharir main baari maatra main paara paaya gaya, jo shaayad unke rasinic vyavsaay kaa parinaam tha
 Mercury poisoning may explain the eccentricities in Newton's last life
 french ganitagya joseph louis lagrange aksar kehete the ki newton mahanatam pratibhashali tha or ek baar unhone kaha ki vah "sabase zyada bhaagyashaalee bhi tha kyonki ham duniya kii pranali ko ek se zyada baar sthapit nahin kar sakate
" angreji kavi alexander pope ne newton kii uplabdhiyon ke dwaara prabhavit hokar prasiddh smriti-lekh likhaa: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "let Newton be" and all was light
 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries
 baad kii vyakhya uski khojon par kai anya vivaadon ke saath bhi upyukt he, jaisaa ki yah prashn ki kalan kii khoj kisne kii, jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he
 Later in history, Newton wrote: main nahin jaanata ki main duniya ko kis rup main dikhaai duungaa lekin apane aap ke liye main ek aisa ladkaa hoon jo samudr ke kinare par khel rahaa he or apane dhyaan ko ab or tab main laga rahaa he, ek adhik chikna pathar yaa ek adhik sundar khol dhundne kii koshish kar rahaa he, sachai kaa yah itnaa bada samudr mere saamne ab tak khoja nahin gaya he
 Newton's memorial can be seen at Westminster Abbey, just north of the entrance to the choir opposite the choir screen

 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"

 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day

 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward thrust of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun which the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii
 a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room in which Newton lived while studying
 brogdel main rashtriya falon kaa sangrah un pedo se grapht kii aapurti kar saktaa he, jo flower of kent ke samaan dikhaai detaa he, jo ek mote goode kii pakaane kii kism he

 du:khant naatak aise naatakon ko kehete hai jinamein nayak pratikul paristhitiyon or shaktiyon se sangharsh karata hua tathaa sankat jhelta hry ant main vinasht ho jaataa he
 Many believe that the story of Tjedi should end in the death of a hero, although there are two works in ancient Greek dramaturgy that do not have the death of a hero, but still count in the rank of the tragedy
 saamanyat: yah bhi mana jaataa he ki tragedy yaa du:khant naatak kaa nayak udaatt gunon se vibhooshit or sambhraant kulotpann hota he, yadhyapi aadhunik du:khant naatakon main, jinamein vyakti or samaaj kaa sangharsh nirupit hota he, iske anek apwaad milte hai
 Not only is the hero of the tragedy, but also his plot and his poetic style give an impression of dignity
 pratyaksh rup main nayak virdohi shaktiyon se ladata hua parajeet or vinasht hota he, kintu naitik drushti se vah utkrisht or safal siddh hota he
 The dignity and grandeur is believed not only by the entire composition, but also by its major instruments
 tragedy ke sambandh main moulik prashn yah he ki nayak kis kaaran se sankatagrast tathaa vinasht hota he
 In which part he himself is responsible for his torture and death, this problem arises continuously in the minds of the audience, observers and critics and it has been resolved in various ways
 pracheen unani tragedy main nayak adhik se adhik dooshit drushtikon, bhraamak bhaavana, athwa kshanik aavesh kaa doshi thahartaa he
 The fatal debility in the character of the hero and the imagined torture and death caused by the effects of Christianity were revealed in the 16th century
 is vishwaas kaa prabhavotpadak nirupan shakespear ke du:khant naatakon main hua he
 In Shakespeare's sorrowful plays, the protagonist is primarily a victim of his weaknesses, though destiny and circumstances are always at stake in his destruction
 aadhunik tragedy main nayak kaa patan saamaajik shaktiyon athwa vanshaparampara ke falswaroop hota he at: nayak kii jimmedaari alpamaatr rah jaati he
 In some of Nil's grief-based plays on the new psychology, the protagonist, Damit Kama, suffers from lust
 tragedy kaa aavirbhaav sarvapratham yunaan main hua
 The word is derived from Trag Oidea which means 'got Song' meaning Ajajit
 prakruti or madiraa ke devtaa dionisus kii puja main aja kaa vishesh mahatv tha tathaa ukt devtaa ke upaask apane nrity or gaan main aja kii gatividhi kaa anukaran karte the
 In its early stages, Tragedy progressed by assimilating two forms of dance called chorus and dithirave
 phir nrity ke saath abhinay or samvaad kaa samavesh hua
 Thus the tragedy developed at a rapid pace, and in the fifth century BCE, Ageschylus, Souphocleus, and Eurupidis composed such excellent sorrowful dramas that are the immortal virtue of the world
 uplabdh du:khant naatakon ke gambhir adhyayan ke uparaant isa purv chauthi shatee main arestu ne tragedy kii vistrut vyakhya prastut kii
 According to him, tragedy is a simulation of a human action that is full of seriousness, and with proper shape
 abhipraay yah he ki tragedy main hasya or vinod ke liye koi sthaan nahin rahata, usamen prarambh, madhya or ant kii samyak niyojna rahati he tathaa natyavastu kaa aakaar yathasambhav deergh hota he
 Aristotle considers plot, character, thought, style, music, and visualization to be essential tools of the tragedy, and it is recognized today with little difference
 tragedy ke prabhaav kii vyakhya arestu ne rechan siddhant ke aadhaar par kii he
 Through the observation and study of the tragedy, the impulse of compassion and fear in the mind is controlled and those sad feelings are refined
 latin main seneka ne aise du:khant naatakon kii rachana kii jinamein ospurn style main hinsa or pratishodh kii abhivyakti hui he
 In the medieval period, the characteristics of the tragedy began to appear in the narrative and then in the newly introduced modern European theater
 navajagaran ke kaal main tragedy ne pracheen or naveen prabhaavon ko ek hi saath grahan kiya or unke sammishran se 16veen shatee isvi main europe ke anek deshon main ucch koti ke du:khant naatakon kaa aavirbhaav hua
 In this connection, the names of Marlowe, Shakespeare, Calderon etc
 are particularly notable
 16veen shatee ke uttarardh main karnil, raccin prabhruti francisi naatakakaron ne shastreey paripati par likhe hue du:khant naatakon kii rachana main vishesh safalataa praapt kii
 These plays were quite different from the works of Shakespeare and other Romantic playwrights because they followed the rules which were disregarded by Shakespeare etc
 udaahranarth karnil or raccin aadi ne natya anvitiyon ke us niyam ko manyata pradaan kii jiskaa parityag karke svachhndathawadiyon ne apni rachana kii thi
 In the 18th century, sorrowful dramas relating to household life and the general middle class were written in many countries of Europe
 kintu yah baat vivadagrast he ki ham unhen tragedy kah sakate hai athwa nahin
 The name 'serious Drama' is used for such plays which are also suitable for many theatrical works of the modern century
 tragedy or syrius drama ke antar kii ore sarvapratham lecing ne sanket kiya tha
 Shakespeare and his contemporary dramatists were more and more accepted in the 19th century during the revival of Romanticism
 at: nishchit shastreey niyamon kaa mahatv bahut nune rah gaya
 The second memorable thing is that the philosopher Hegel based on his dialectical philosophy presented a new and miraculous interpretation of the tragedy
 hegel kaa mat he ki tragedy ke liye virdohi shaktiyon kaa sangharsh athwa dwandv bahya prabhaavon kaa athwa aantarik manovritiyon kaa ho saktaa he
 On the basis of this new conception, the ancient theater was practiced and new forms of tragedy were revealed
 19veen or 20veen shatabdi main vyakti or saamaajik shaktiyon ke prabal sangharsh par aadhrut jo anek du:khant naatak likhe gaye hai unka utsa hegel kii naveen sthapana main hi miltaa he
 Several updated forms of Tragedy are available
 houptman, ibson prabhruti ke du:khant-naatakon main nayak vanshaparampara se utpann ghaatak prabhaavon kaa shikaar banataa he
 It would be more appropriate to call the form of tragedy in problematic plays, as in the serial drama
 vartmaankaal main tragedy kaa sarvottam rup kaavyatmak naatakon main miltaa he or ab yah dharna adhikadhik drudh hoti ja rahi he ki vishuddh tragedy kavyanaty ke kshetra main hi sambhav he
 The two main differences of the tragedy are the scriptures and the Romanticists
 shastreey tragedy main anviti, auchity aadi se sambandhit niyamon kaa kathor aagrah sweekaar kiya gaya he
 In the Romantic tragedy, the effect of unity is taken care of, but there is almost total violation of certain rules
 in do pramukh kotiyon ke atirikt aadhunik kaal main tragedy ke anek anya prakaar viksit hue hai jaise saamaajik tragedy, manovaigyanik tragedy aadi
 The latest form of the tragedy is very varied and interesting even if it is somewhat different from the ancient Greek tragedy

 Subsequently, this concept was changed to demand a separate independent autonomous country called Pakistan for the "muslims of India"

 The first general elections were held in 1936 / 1937 in the first phase of the process of handing over power to the public by the British Raj in the subcontinent, the Muslim League had to be defeated badly and its claim that it was severely demoralized by the Muslims of the subcontinent

 The Muslim League could not gain power in any of the 11 provinces of India
 in paristhitiyon main muslim lig aisa lagata tha, upmahadweep ke raajnneetik dhara se alag hoti ja rahi he
 During this period, the Congress, which for the first time had drunk too much of power, took such measures that fear and threats started taking birth in the hearts of the Muslims
 jaise congress ne hindi ko rashtrabhasha ghoshit kar diya, gaao kshay par pabandi laga di or congress ke tirange ko rashtriya dhvaj kaa darja diya
 With the Muslim League losing power in this case, there was a feeling under its leadership that the Muslim League was deprived of power on the grounds that it called itself the House of Representatives of Muslims
 yahi prarambh bindu tha muslim lig ke netritv main do alag rashtron kii bhaavana jaagrukta ki
 At the same time, the discussion between the British Raj and the Congress on the issue of full transfer of power in return for World War II support broke out and when the Congress split from power, some doors were opened for the Muslim League

 Due to this incident, there was tremendous tension in Lahore and in Punjab, the Muslim League's ally, the Uniunsat Party was in power and there was a danger that the shin carrier workers of Deen should not allow this meeting of the Muslim League or there is an uproar on this occasion 
 sanyog hi gambhirtha ke maddenjar mohammad ali jinna ne udghaatan satr ko sambodhit kiya jisamen unhone pehali baar kaha ki bharat main samasya sampradayik raarna tarah kaa nahin he balki ben international he yani yah do deshon kii samasya he
 He said that the difference between Hindus and Muslims is so big and clear that their alliance under a central government will be full of dangers
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main ek hi rasta he ki unhen alag mamalakatein hoon
 On the same day, on 23 March, the then Chief Minister of Bengal, Maulvi Kripa Haq, gave a resolution in Lahore, stating that no constitutional scheme would be feasible nor would Muslims have until the geographical units met each other
 Separate singing areas should not be limited

 In April 1941, at the conference of the Muslim League in Madras, the resolution Lahore was included in the party's constitution and it was on this basis that the Pakistan movement started

 For the first time, areas for Pakistan's demand were identified on 7 April 1946 in a three-day conference in Delhi attended by Muslim Legion members of the Central and Provincial Legislative Assemblies

 The areas to be included in Pakistan were clearly identified in this Karadad
 purvottar main bengal or assam or uttar pashchim main punjab, seemaa, sindh or baluchistan
 Surprisingly, there was no mention of Kashmir in this resolution although there was a Muslim dominated area in the North West and annexed to Punjab

 Perhaps few people know that the original draft of Sankalp Lahore was prepared by Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, the then UNIANSUT Chief Minister of Punjab
 uninst party us jamaane main muslim lig main ekikrut ho gai thi or sir sikandar hayaat khan punjab muslim lig ke adhyaksh the
 In the original draft resolution, the head Sikandar Hayat Khan proposed almost a central government on the basis of a central government in the subcontinent, but when the draft was considered in the Muslim League Subject Committee, quaid-e-azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah himself mentioned the only central government in this draft

 He said that he was strongly opposed to the distribution on the basis of Hindu Raj on the one hand and Muslim Raj on the other hand in India and he would fight against their destructive distribution in such a manner

 Sir Sikander Hayat Khan died the second year in 1942, at the age of 50, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah got freedom from Hisar in Punjab due to intense opposition

 lekin jab pakistan kii samvidhan sabha samvidhan set karegi to vah is samasya ke antim madhyasth hogi or yah do alag rajyon ke gathan ke faisle kaa puraa adhikaar hoga
 But the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan did not consider the establishment of two independent and autonomous states of Muslims in the subcontinent neither in quaid-e-azam life nor when the country's first constitution was passed in 1956

 The mutual broadcasting system, which Westwood One acquired two years ago, followed suit and essentially merged with NBC Radio

 Recording sessions for the album occurred in several recording studios from 2007 to 2009, and Dr

 As a result, he received a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album during the 52nd Grammy Awards
 2005 ke baad se hi, eminem apane sangeet se naata tod kar hip hop nirmaataa ban kar anya record kaaryon ko karne kaa icchhuk tha, visheshkar un kalakaaron ke liye, jo uske apane label shaidi records ke liye sin kiye gayi the
 However, Eminem's bad phase began when the European Leg of the Anger Management Tour had to be canceled in the summer of 2005 due to fatigue and addiction to his sleeping pills
 The following year, he remarried to his ex-wife Kimberly Scott for only 11 weeks after which he was divorced again, while his close friend and colleague rapper Dishon "proof" Holton was later in an altercation outside a nightclub in Detroit
 He was shot and killed
 is se niraash ho kar, eminem nashili dawaaon kaa aadi ban gaya or tezi se khud main simatata chalaa gaya
 In an interview for XXL in June 2009, Eminem stated the impact of Proof's death on himself: may 2007 se hi eminem dwaara aagaamee album par dhyaan lagane kii khabaren 50 saint or state kuo, jo shaidi record ke kramshah vartmaan or purv sadsy the, dwaara di ja raheen thim

 In a discussion on radio station WQHT Hot 97 on 12 September 2007, Eminem stated that he was in limbo and could not say anything definitive about releasing any new material in the near future
 iske baad raper ne vistaar se bataaya ki vah lagaataar ricarding studio main kaam kar rahaa tha or nijee muddon ke nipatane se khush tha
 However, in December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized due to an overdose of methadone
 2008 ke shuru main, apni lat se baahar aane ke liye usne tvilv step program shuru kiya or uske anusaar, 20 april 2008 se usne nasha karnaa chhod diya he
 In 2005, during the early stages of Rylaps' recording, two years after the rapper began treating his sleeping pills addiction, record producer and longtime Detroit collaborator Jeff Bass, along with Bass Brothers, worked on 25 songs with Eminem 
 pruf kii maut ke kaaran, eminem ek avadhi tak kuch bhi nayaa nahin likh sakaa, kyonki usne mahasoos kiya ki uske dwaara likhi gayi har chiz recording ke laayak nahin thi
 To avoid this, Bass decided to choose a production style that required the artist to rap for the song that passed over his head instead of writing the story
 iske baad eminem mukt rup se yaa tokane se pehle ek samay main ek line gaata tha or uske baad duusari line gaata tha
