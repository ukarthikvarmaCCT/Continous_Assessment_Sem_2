 ise australesian champlenship kaa naam diya gaya kyonki 1912 tak iskaa aayojan australia evam newjiland donon ne kiya The competition was only expanded to include women's tennis in 1922
 Due to the geographical distance separating it from the other tournaments, the top American and European players rarely deigned to travel down to the Antipodes until the end of the 1970s, meaning that the title was almost exclusively won by Australians up until that date
 In 1972, The Australian Tennis Federation decided to change the venue of the event every year, with Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and even New Zealand taking turns to host the tournament
 In 1983, the Australian Open set up home in Kooyong, Melbourne, where it began to earn the respect of the tennis-playing world until its move in 1988 to Flinders Park
 Grass courts made way for hard rebound ace surfaces, and in 1997, Flinders Park was renamed Melbourne Park
 Since 1988, the Australian Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to have two courts covered by retractable roofs

 oxygen gas shwasan angon se visaran dwaara rakt main pravesh kar jaati he
 Blood is the medium of transport that carries this oxygen to the cells of different parts of the body
 vahaan iskaa upyog koshikaaye apane koshikeey shwasan main karti hai
 Respiratory activity occurs in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of each living cell
 shwasan sambandhit praarambhik kriyaayein cytoplasm main hoti he tathaa shesh kriyaayein mitocandriaon main hoti hai
 Since most of the energy is produced in the last phase of the action itself
 isliye mitocandria ko koshika kaa shwasanang yaa shakti-grih kaha jaataa he
 In the first phase of the action of respiration, the fluids go away and the remaining 96 percent of the energy is stored in pyruvic acid

 The Krebs cycle is the second stage of oxy respiration
 yah eukariotic koshika ke mitocondria tathaa prokariots ke koshika drav main hoti he
 In this activity, the end substance of glycolysis is pyruvic acid fully oxidized to carbon dioxide and water and many substances are used which are used in other biochemical circuits like amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, fatty acids and glucose etc
 It is used in the manufacture of energy and a large amount of energy is released
 yah kriya kai charnon main hoti he tathaa ek chakra ke rup main kaary karti he
 This cycle was first studied by Hans Adolf Kreb, who named it the Krebs cycle
 is kriya kaa pratham kriyafal citric amla he atah is kriya ko citric amla chakra bhi kehete hai

 Pyruvic acid reacts with oxaloacetic acid during the Kreb cycle of respiration
 isamen teen sah-anzim kaam aate hai
 First the pyruvic acid oxidizes in the presence of an enzyme and turns into carbon dioxide and hydrogen
 hydrogen dydrogen grahi enedy ke saath sanyukt hokar enediech tu banaata he tathaa carbon dioxide gas vayumandal main mukt ho jaati he
 In the presence of many respiratory enzymes, the hydrogen present in NADH 2 is converted to water and released energy consisting of oxygen

 kuch vishesh paristhitiyon main ucch shrenee ke jantuon, paudhon ke utakon, bijon, rasadaar falon aadi main bhi oxygen kii anupasthiti main hota he
 This respiration occurs when the muscles of humans or high-grade organisms are exhausted
 jin jeevadhariyon main yah shwasan hota he use anerobs kehete hai
 Similar to oxy respiration, glycolysis takes place at the beginning of anoxic respiration, at the end of which pyruvic acid is formed
 aage kii prakriya main oxygen ke abhaav main piruvik amla kaa purna oxikaran nahin ho paata he atah is shwasan main oxic shwasan kii tulana main bahut kam urja utpann hoti he
 In plants, this pyruvic acid is converted to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide in the presence of carboxylase enzyme
 iske baad acitaldihide dihydroginej injim kii upasthiti main NADH2 dwaara avakrut hokar NAD tathaa ithyle alcohol main parinat ho jaataa he
 In the absence of oxygen in the muscles of animals and some bacteria, the pyruvic acid produced at the end of glycolysis is converted to lactic acid with the help of NADH2
 kinvan anaksi shwasan kii ek vishisht rasinic kriya he
 It involves the decomposition of complex organic compounds into simple compounds in the presence of micro-organisms and enzymes

 In respiration, the volume of carbon dioxide that exits and the amount of oxygen absorbed is called the respiratory quotient
 yah sadaiv sankhya main nirupit kiya jaataa he jaise- 6CO2 / 6O2 = 1shwasan bhagfal se is baat kaa sanket miltaa he ki shwasan kii kriya main kis prakaar ke khadyapadaarth kaa upchayan ho rahaa he, kyonki yah anupaat vibhinn khadyapadaarthon ke upchayan main vibhinn hota he
 Its value is greater than the unit, less than the unit, depending on the foods used in respiration
 jab shwasan kii kriya main upachayit honevaala khadyapadaarth carbohydrate hota he tab shwasan bhagfal kaa maan ikai hota he, jaise ankurit genhun ke bijon main
 When the food substance used in respiration is fat or protein, the value of the respiratory quotient is less than one unit
 2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O + urja Respiratory coefficient values can range from 0
4 to 0
9 when a food substance is used in respiration
 yadi hamen RQ kaa maan gyaat ho to is baat kaa anumaan laga sakate hai ki shwasan kii kriya main kis prakaar ke khadyapadaarth kaa upchayan ho rahaa he
 In the process of photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the presence of light and release oxygen gases into the atmosphere
 jisase vaataavaran main oxigen kii sandrata kaa bad janaa tathaa carbon daai-oxide kaa kam hona swaabhaavik hota he, parantu vastav main aisa nahin hota he
 In respiration, the living organisms consume oxygen gases at all times of the day and night and discard carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere
 is prakaar shwasan kriya dwaara vaataavaran main oxigen evam carbon daai-oxide gaison kaa santulan bana rahata he
 Respiration is an energy-releasing process
 shwasan kii kriya main bhojya padaarthon kaa oxikaran hota he, jisase unamem sanchit urja mukt hoti he
 During respiration, some part of the free energy is stored as ATP in the cell's mitochondria
 atipi ke rup main sanchit yah urja bhavishya main sajiv jeevadhariyon ke vibhinn jaivik kriyaayon ke sanchaalan main prayukt hoti he
 The released thermal energy helps to balance the body temperature of living organisms
 kuch kiton tathaa samudri jantuon ke sharir se prakaash utpann hota he
 It is a metamorphic form of energy generated by respiration
 kuch samudri jeevon jaise- electric-re machhlee tathaa tarpeado aadi kaa sharir aatm-raksha ke liye vidyutiya tarange utpann karata he, yah vidyut shwasan dwaara utpann urja ke roopaantaran se utpann hota he
 Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary and opposite to each other
 prakaash-sanshleshan main carbon daai-oxide or jal ke bich rasinic kriya ke falswaroop glucose kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxigen mukt hoti he
 Oxidation of glucose in respiration results in the formation of water and carbon dioxide
 prakaash-sanshleshan ek rachanaatmak kriya he iske falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main vruddhi hoti he
 Respiration is a nasal activity, which results in a decrease in the dry weight of living organisms
 prakaash-sanshleshan main saurya urja ke prayog se bhojan banataa he, vikiran urja kaa roopaantaran rasinic urja main hota he
 While the oxidation of food in respiration releases energy, the chemical energy stored in the food is used lively in its various functions
 is prakaar ye donon kriyaayein apane kachche maal ke liye ek duusare ke ant padaarthon par nirbhar rahete hue ek duusare kii poorak hoti hai
 Bio-chemical activities take place in every cell in the body of living organisms
 in kriyaaon ke sampaadan hetu dainik urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The main source of energy is food
 saura urja bhojan main sthitij urja ke rup main sanchit rahati he
 The main substance of respiration in respiration is the complete or incomplete oxidation of glucose in the presence or absence of oxygen, as a result of which the potential energy stored in the food is released as kinetic energy, thereby releasing the energy required to carry out the daily activities of life
 And there is fulfillment
 shwasan main oxikaran ke liye aavashyak glucose, poshan ke madhya hi nirmit hota he
 The energy required for nutrition is derived from the energy produced in respiration
 is prakaar shwasan tathaa poshan ek-duusare se abhinn rup se sambandhit he
 Most of the lifespan method of living respiration is dependent on ATP formation through cellular respiration, but anaerobic respiration first developed during evolution
 vatanirpekshi shwasan ke sarvapratham viksit hone kaa kaaran prithvi ke vayumandal main oxygen gas kii anuplabdhta thi
 4
6 billion years ago, the main gases in the Earth's atmosphere were carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water vapor and hydrogen sulfide
 isi vaataavaran main 3
5 billian varsh pehle pratham koshikeey sajiv kii utpatti hui
 These were prokaryotes
 inaki koshikeey sanrachana atyant saral thi
 Since there was no independent oxygen in the atmosphere, anaerobic process of respiration developed in these living organisms that did not require oxygen
 iske baad kareeb 1 billian varsh tak yahi prokariots prithvi par raaj karte rahe
 In it, photosynthesis was done to make its own food
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main surya ke prakaash kii upasthiti main carbon daai-oxide or jal kii sahaayta se carbohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxygen gas mukt hoti he

 babu shyaam sundar das kii bhashaa shuddh saahitiyik hindi he, jisamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii pradhanta he
 In relation to the language, his idea was - 'when we accept foreign words with foreign expressions, then make them so that the foreignness comes out of them and they become disciplined by our grammar rules
 ' isliye jahaan kahin unhone apni bhashaa main 'urdu' ke prachlit shabdon kaa prayog kiya he, vahaan unka urdupan nikaal diya he, kalam, kavayad, kanoon aadi shabdon ke neeche kii bindi hataakar or unke uccharan badal kar unhone unka prayog liya he
 Similarly, by removing the rarity of Sanskrit words, they are written in Hindi in a simple way - like work in place of work, anjan in place of anjan
 shabd chayan ke bare main babu shyamsundar das kaa mat tha- 'sabase pehla sthaan shuddh hindi ke shabdon ko, uske peeche sanskrit ke sugam or prachlit shabdon ko, iske peeche farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke saadhaaran or prachlit shabdon kaa or sabase peeche sanskrit ke aprachlit shabdon ko sthaan diya jaae

 2
 gaveshnatmak style- gaveshnatmak nibandhon main gaveshnatmak style kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The sentences are relatively few long

 Due to the intensity and dryness of the subject it is somewhat dry and devoid of style
 is prakaar kii style kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie- 'this life struggle is beginning to seem even more intense and painful due to the attrition of two different civilizations
 is avasthaa ke anukool hi jab sahitya utpann hokar samaaj ke mastishk ko protsaahit or prati kriyman karegaa tabhi vaastavik unnati ke lakshan dekh padenge or uskaa kalyankari fal desh ko aadhunik kaal kaa gaurav pradaan karegaa

 sahitya ke samast kshetron ke abhaavon ko dur karne ke liye unhone sankalpabaddh hokar shram kiya
 Due to his achievements as a language philosopher or as a lecturer of the principles, literary literature remained a destiny of Hindi students for a long time
 inke man main yah dharna nirbhaant rahi ki hindi kii saidhantik samiksha kaa aadhaar sanskrit or pashchimi aalochana-siddhanton ko mila kar or unhen ek khaas saamanjasy ke saath hi banaaya janaa chahie
 Prior to Shyam Sundar Das there was a particularly critical time for Hindi and Nagari script
 pratap narayan mishra ne kai sthanon par hindi ke prachaar ke liye sabhaayen sthapit kii thim
 One such meeting was established in 1884 in Prayag under the name of 'hindi Savarni Pratik Madhya Bharat Sabha'
 sarkari dacrataron main nagari ke pravesh ke liye bhaaratendu harishchandra ne bhi kai baar udhyam kiya, par unhen safalataa nahin mil saki
 Despite this, the effort continued
 adalati bhashaa urdu hone ke kaaran navshikshiton main urdu padhane waalon kii sankhya adhik thi, jisase hindi pustakon ke prakaashan kaa kaary aage nahin bad paata tha
 In addition to this literature-crisis, the entry of Nagari into the government offices was a grave crisis in front of people who knew it
 isi daur main kuch utsaahi chaatro ke udyog se, jinamein babu shyaam sundar das pramukh the, 1893 main kaashi nagari prachaarini sabha kii sthapana kii gayi
 Here too, remember the statement of Ramchandra Shukla that, 'tell me the truth, all the prosperity and fame of this gathering is the fruit of Babu Shyam Sundar Das's sacrifice and continuous hard work
 ve aadi se ant tak iske pranaswaroop sthit hokar baraabar ise anek bade udyogon main tatpar karte rahe
 Its first chairman was Bharatendu's brother-in-law Radhakrishna Das

 ashtaadhi main 3155 sutara or aarambh main varnsamamnay ke 14 pratyaahaar sutara hai
 The magnitude of Ashtadhyayi is equal to one thousand Anushtupa Shlokas
 mahabhashya main ashtaadhi ko "sarvaveda-parishad-shaastra" kaha gaya he
 That is, Ashtadhyayi was not confined to any Vedic special and was related to all Vedic codes and Panini was respectful of all provident opinions
 ashtaadhi main anek purvaacharyon ke maton or sutron kaa sannivesh kiya gaya
 Among them, Shaktayana, Shakalya, Abhishali, Gargya, Galav, Bharadwaja, Kashyapa, Shaunak, Sphotayan, Chakravarmana are mentioned by Panini
 ashtaadhi ke karta panini kab hue, is vishay main kai mat hai
 Bhandarkar and Goldstalker date back to the 7th century BC
 Believe it
 mcdanel, kith aadi kitne hi vidwaanon ne inhen chauthi shatabdi i
pus
 mana he
 According to Indian tradition, Panini was a contemporary of Nandas and this time was in the 5th century BC
 Should be panini main shatmaan, vinshatik or karshapan aadi jin mudraon kaa ek saath ullekh he unke aadhaar par evam anya kai kaarnon se hamen panini kaa kaal yahi samichin jaan padataa he
 Ashtadhyayi has eight chapters and each chapter has four chapters
 pehle duusare adhyyon main sangya or paribhaasha sambandhi sutara hai evam vaakya main aae hue kriya or sangya shabdon ke parsparik sambandh ke niamak prakaran bhi hai, jaise kriya ke liye aatmanepad-parasmapad-prakaran, evam sangyaaon ke liye vibhakti, samaas aadi
 The third, fourth and fifth chapters contain all types of suffixes
 tisare adhyay main dhaatuon main pratyay lagaakar kridant shabdon kaa nirvachan he or chauthe tathaa paanchave adhyyon main sangya shabdon main pratyay jodakar bane nae sangya shabdon kaa vistrut nirvachan bataaya gaya he
 The semantics that these suffixes reveal are called vritti in the definition of grammar, like Indradhanu occurring in the rain will be called the annual Indradhanu
 varsha main honevaale is vishesh arth ko prakat karanevaala "ek" pratyay taddhit pratyay he
 There are 1,190 sutras in the episode and 631 in the Kridanta episode
 is prakaar kridant, taddhit pratyayon ke vidhaan ke liye ashtaadhi ke 1,821 arthath aadhe se kuch hi kam sutara viniyukt hue hai
 The sixth, seventh and eighth chapters refer to the changes that occur in the letters of the word
 ye parivartan yaa to mul shabd main judanevaale pratyayon ke kaaran yaa sandhi ke kaaran hote hai
 The legislative sutras of dualism, propagation, pact, tone, agam, omission, long etc
 have come in the sixth chapter
 chathe adhyay ke chauthe paad se saatven adhyay ke ant tak angadhikaar naamak ek vishisht prakaran he jisamen un parivartanon kaa varnan he jo pratyay ke kaaran mul shabdon main yaa mul shabd ke kaaran pratyay main hote hai
 These changes are also seen in the form of legislation of long, low, loss, advance, order, quality, growth, etc
 ashtum adhyay main, vaakyagat shabdon ke dwitvavidhan, plutavidhan evam shatv or natvavidhan kaa visheshat: upadesh he
 In addition to Ashtadhyayi, two episodes related to the same, namely Ganapath and Dhatipatha, were also definitely made of Panini
 unki parampara aaj tak akshunn chali aati he, yadhyapi ganpaath main kuch nae shabd bhi puraani soochiyon main kaalaantar main jod die gaye hai
 The present Unadi Sutras are suspected to be panoramic and cannot be considered as an integral part of Ashtadhyayi's text
 vartmaan unadi sutara shakatayan-vyakaran ke gyaat haate hai
 Panini aimed to refine and regularize the present form of Sanskrit language by incorporating the various components and components of the language such as phonology, name, verse, verb, sentence, gender etc
 and their interrelations in the 32 verses of the Ashtadhyayi, which comprise eight chapters
 i am equally divided
 vyakaran ke is mahneey granth main panini ne vibhakti-pradhan sanskrit bhashaa ke vishaal kalevar kaa samgr evam sampoorn vivechan lagbhag 4000 sutron main kiya he, jo aath adhyyon main sankhya kii drushti se asmaan rup se vibhajit hai
 Keeping in mind the misbehavior of writing material in the society then, Panini has taken the help of sutra style to make the grammar memorable
 punah, vivechan ko atishay sankshipt banane hetu panini ne apane purvavarti vaiyakarnon se praapt upkarnon ke saath-saath swayan bhi anek upkarnon kaa prayog kiya he jiname shivasutra yaa maheshwar sutara sabase mahatvapurn hai
 It is famous that Maharishi Panini received these sutras from Devadhidev Shiva
 panini ne sanskrit bhashaa ke sabhi shabdon ke nirvachan ke liye kareeb 4000 sutron kii rachana kii jo ashtaadhi ke aath adhyyon main vaigyanik dhang se sangruhit hai
 These formulas are exactly like the mathematics formulas
 jis tarah se jatil evam vistrut ganitiya dharanaon athwa siddhanton ko sutron dwaara saralata se vyakt kiya jaataa he, usee tarah panini ne sutron dwaara atyant sankshep main hi vyakaran ke jatil niyamon ko spasht kar diya he
 He had to compose 4000 sutras to discuss all aspects of the language
 panini ne ashtaadhi main prakarnon tathaa tadsambandhit sutron kaa vibhaajan vaigyanik reeti se kiya he
 Panini has divided Ashtadhyayi into two parts: Sapadasaptadhyayi from the first chapter to the first foot of the eighth chapter and the remaining three feet are called Tripadi
 panini ne purvatrasiddham sutara banaakar nirdesh diya he ki sapadasptadhyaayi main vivechit niyamon kii tulana main tripadi main varnit niyam asiddh hai
 That is, if there is conflict between the rules mentioned in both the parts, then the rule of the former part will be valid
 isi tarah, sapadasptadhyaayi ke antargat aane vaale sutron main bhi virodh drushtigochar hone par krmanusaar parvarti sutara kaa praadhanya rahegaa – vipratishedhe paran kaaryam
 After establishing these principles, Panini firstly defined noun terms and later discussed topics based on those noun terms
 sankshiptata banaae rakhane ke liye panini ne anek upaay kiye hai
 Most important in this is the construction of distinct nouns
 vyakaran ke niyamon ko bataane main bhashaa ke jin shabdon / aksharon samoohon kii baarambaar aavashyaktaa padati thi, unhen panini ne ekatra kar vibhinn vishisht naam de diya jo sangyaaon ke rup main ashtaadhi main aavashyaktaanusaar vibhinn prasangon main prayukt kiye gaye hai
 Panini defines similar nouns before stating the rules, such as - Maheshwar Sutra - 'pratyahara, it, ti, nadi, ghu, verse, metal, suffix, organ, allegiance, etc
 inamen se kuch ko panini ne apane purvavarti vaiyakarnon se udhaar liya he
 But most have been made by them themselves
 in sangyaaon kaa vivaran aage diya gaya he
 In considering some elements of grammar, such as metal, suffixes, prefixes, Panini required many rules
 aise niyamon ke nirmaan ke pehle, prarambh main hi panini un sambandhit avyavon kaa ullekh kar bataa dete hai ki aage ek nishchit sutara tak in avyavon kaa adhikaar rahegaa
 They have already defined these elements as nouns
 duusare shabdon main panini prakaran vishesh kaa nirvachan us prakaran kii moolbhoot sangya – yatha dhaatu, pratyay ityadi – ke adhikaar main karte hai jisase unhe prayek sutara main sambandhit sangya ko baar–baar duhraana nahin padataa he
 This tool is very helpful in bringing brevity
 shabdon / padon ke nirvachan ke liye, prakruti ke aadhaar par panini ne chah prakaar ke sutron kii rachana kii he: Who apply their property to other sutras
 panini kaa vyakaran sanskrit bhashaa kaa atyant sookshm vishleshan karata he
 It not only describes the standard language of the time, it also describes the Vedic Sanskrit and Sanskrit regional experiments
 yahan tak ki panini ne bhashaa ke saamaajik-bhashik prayog par bhi prakaash daalaa he
 Panini's grammar is so small that it has been memorized
 yadhyapi panini ne apana vyakaran sanskrit ke liye rachaa, kintu isaki yuktiyaan or upkaran sabhi bhashaaon ke vyakaran ke vishleshan main prayukt kii ja sakati hai
 In Ashtadhyayi, there is a holistic view of Vedic Sanskrit and Sanskrit used in the contemporary courtesan of Panini
 vaidic bhashaa kaa vyakaran apekshaakrit or bhi paripurna ho saktaa tha
 Panini did a very good survey of his contemporary Sanskrit language
 inke shabdasangrah main teen prakaar kii vishesh suchiyaan ai hai : From the point of view of history, many other types of cultural material, words and institutions have got embedded in the formulas
 ashtaadhi ke saath aarambh se hi arthon kii vyakhyapoorak koi vritti bhi thi jiske kaaran ashtaadhi kaa ek naam, jaisaa patanjali ne likhaa he, vrittisutra bhi tha
 Moreover, there were circles such as Mathurivitti, Punavriti etc
 which have the current Kashikavruti in their tradition
 ashtaadhi kii rachana ke lagbhag do shatabdi ke bheetar katyayan ne sutron kii bahumukhi samiksha karte hue lagbhag chaar sahasr vaartikon kii rachana kii jo sutarastyli main hi hai
 Patanjali produced Mahabhashya, which is the paramount treatise on Paninian formulas in terms of meaning, example and process, with Vartikutra and some Vrittisutras
 "ath shabdanushasanam"- yah mahabhashya kaa pratham vaakya he
 Panini, Katyayana and Patanjali - these three are the main masters of grammar science known as ‘munitraya’
 panini ke sutron ke aadhaar par bhattozidikshit ne siddhantakoumudi kii rachana kii, or unke shishy varadaraj ne siddhantakoumudi ke aadhaar par laghusiddhantakoumudi kii rachana kii
