 This is a depiction of a thoughtful woman with a very light smile
 yah sansar kii sambhavat: sabase prasiddh painting he jo painting or drushya kala kii paryaay maani jaati he
 It is believed that the Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci created this picture called Mona Lisa between 1503 and 1506
 ye tasviir florence ke ek gumnaam se vyapaaree 'francesco del jeeyocondo' kii patni 'lija gherardini' ko dekhakar banaai gai he
 Currently this image is kept in the Louviere Museum in France

 The original painting of Monalisa is only 21 inches long and 30 inches wide
 tasviir ko bachaae rakhane ke liye yah ek khaas kism ke shishe ke peeche rakhi gai he jo naa to chamakta he or naa tuutata he
 Monalisa is the immortal artwork of the legendary Italian artist Leonardo de Vinci painted by Vinci between 1503 and 1507
 It took Leonardo four years to create this painting, although during this time he was baptized by St
 Paul and the Virgin and Child with St
 Also made two other works of art called Andre
 lagbhag 500 varsh purv 30
5” unche 20 7 / 8 chaude, 12 me0 me0 motaai ke popeler lakdi ke panel par tel ke rangon se yah chitra banaaya gaya
 The classic artist Leonardo da Vinci, who created the artwork, was born in 1452 in a small town called Vinci, in the east of Florence, Italy
 inke pita sar piyaren da vinci ek notary the
 Seeing Leonardo's keen interest in art since childhood, the father sent him to Paris for higher education in art
 jo ki us samay kala shiksha kaa ek pramukh kendra tha, yahan rah kar ve ek berakia ke studiyon main kala kii shiksha lene lage
 While staying here, Leonardo gained extensive knowledge of painting from his guru and became aware of its specifics
 sheeghra hi guru ne mahasoos kiya ki unka shishy unase bhi kahin guni va pratibhavan he, atah guru ke paas jitna bhi gyaan tha, apane shishy vinci ko de diya
 In addition to painting, Leonardo also specialized in engineering, study of human anatomy
 rhite bandhuon ke janm se saikadon varsh pehle jab hawaii jahaaj kii kalpana bhi mushkil thi tab liyanardo ne hawa main udne vaali mashin kaa model banaaya tha
 With the passion to understand the complex structure of the human body, Leonardo would dig into the cemetery from the cemetery in the darkness of night and bring it to the studs
 maanav sharir ke aantarik angon ko katate va unki draning banaakar vistrut nots likhte
 These historical sketches and comments are still preserved today, so Leonardo has made hundreds of paintings and drawings in his life, some of which are names of famous works of art, the more fame the masterpiece Monalisa got on Da Last Supper, Madonna Inn, etc
 Hai, he is really amazing

 He considered excessive cleanliness as a possible reason behind this
 florence jahaan par san 1503 main painting banani shuru hui vahaan se praapt dastavejon ke aadhaar par unka kathan he ki isi varsh ke ant main monalisa ne ek shishu ko janm diya tha
 This has been confirmed by an Italian and American researcher quoting documents from the religious ceremony of naming the infant by a church pastor from Florence
 newland kaa vishwaas he ki monaalisa ne apane pet main pal rahe bachche kii smriti va anusansha se apana chitra banwaaya tha
 His statement is that because of the thrill of new life coming into the world and the happiness that pulverizes motherhood, it is this unique and wonderful smile on his face

 In 1550, a photograph of Lisa Silkardini, the wife of a silk merchant, was named Mona Lisa by the famous biographer, George Vasari, a resident of Italy of renaissance carpet artists
 italvi main mona shabd madam ke liye prayukt hota he
 However, the woman depicted in this artwork has also been known by her other nickname Laziocande until centuries later
 us samay kii adhiktar kala-kritiyon kii bhaanti is chitra main bhi kalakaar ke hastakshar, tithi va poj dene vaali mahila kaa naam mudrit nahin he
 According to Pallanati, the houses of Leonardo's father Sir Pierre and Francisco were not far apart, but the two families had close relations
 us samay lija kii aayu 24 varsh thi
 While Monalisa's mysterious smile has remained a mystery for centuries, German art historian Ms
 Maik bogt-lairesen has claimed that the woman seen in the photograph is Ishabella, wife of Duque of Arango Prefecture, Italy
 sushri mike ke anusaar ishabela kii muskaan main dukh he kyonki liyanardo ke painting banane se kuch samay pehle hi uski maan kaa dehant ho gaya tha
 Ishakella's drunken husband would often beat and beat her after getting drunk
 apni prakashit pustak ‘hu ij monaalisa ’ insearch main anekon samantaanen ginvaayi hai
 The book further states that Leonardo, who was a royal artist in the court of Duque, was very close to Isabella
 kareeb 8 varsh purv japan main daanton ke ek doctor ne yah kah kar sabko hairat main daal diya tha ki monaalisa kii rahasyamayi muskaan kaa raaj uske upree jabade main aage ke do daanton kaa tutaa hona he or isi kaaran uske upree hoth ek taraf kuch dabaa hua-sa dikhaai de rahaa he, isi kaaran uskaa ek upree hoth ek taraf se kuch dabaa hua sa dikhaai de rahaa he
 This is why Monalisa and the mysterious smile appear in the unknown when it is not really a smile but an attempt to push the lips from the tongue with its broken teeth so that the lips do not look pressed
 yah doctor pichley kai varshon se monaalisa par shodh kar rahe the
 In December 1986, Ms
 Lillian Swadze, a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories in the US, created a world-wide buzz on the basis of her research, saying that Leonardo Vinci's famous artwork Monalisa is not a mysterious woman but her own self-portrait of a painter
 art and entics naamak patrika main prakashit lekh main sushri lilian ne daawa kiya ki 1518 main laal chaak se bane linordovinci kaa aatmachitra va monaalisa ke chitra ko jab usne paas-paas rakhaa to yah dekhakar dang rah gai ki liyanardo tathaa monaalisa ke chehre, ankhen, gaal, naak va baalo main adbhat samanta he
 With the help of a computer, she was completely transformed into Leonardo when she was seen wearing Leonardo's hair, beard, and hair on top of Monalisa's face
 iske vipareet liyanardo ke chehre se yadi dadhi, bal, munch, bhave aadi hataa di jaye to liyanardo monaalisa main badal jate he
 Sword ji states that Leonardo has portrayed himself as Monalisa
 unhone iske peeche ek kalakaar kaa samalangik hona pramukh kaaran bataaya he
 There is a strong possibility that Vinci is gay and is interested in adapting bisexual themes into the artwork and due to this trend he portrayed himself as a woman and named her Monalisa

 After the encouragement of Percy Shelley, Mary turned this short story into a full-fledged novel

 Frankenstein was unhappy with the monster he created, established by the fact that he did not give him a name and because of this he had no identity
 bajaae iske, francnstin ne uskaa zikr karne ke liye "daitya", "rakshas", "dusht", "kamina" or "vah" jaise shabdon kaa prayog kiya
 When in the 10th chapter, Frankenstein talks to the monster, he addresses him with abuses such as "disgusting worm", "hideous monster", "wicked", "bastard devil" and "hideous devil"
 francnstin ke bare main bataate hue shelli ne us daitya ko "aadam" naam se bhi sambodhit kiya
 Shelley in her epigraph, citing the first human in Eden's garden; daitya ko aksar "francnstin" kaha jaataa he, jo bilkul galat he
 In 1908 a writer said "it is strange that the word" Frankenstein "is used incorrectly around the world, including in scholarly terms, to describe a terrible monster

 naam ke asalipan ko lekar unke kai daavon ke baavjood ye kai kayaason or vivaadon se ghira rahaa he
 In German, Frankenstein actually means "stone of Franks"
 The name is associated with many places, such as Castle Frankenstein, which Mary Shelley saw while traveling on a boat before writing the novel
 francnstin peletinut kshetra main ek kasbe kaa naam bhi he; or 1946 se pehle poland ke silisia main zabkovis slaski naam ke shahar ko francnstin in shalasian ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa tha
 Recently, Radu Floresu claimed in his book In Search of Frankenstein that Mary and Percy Shelley had visited Castle Frankenstein in Darmstadt, on the banks of the Rhine River, on their way to Switzerland, where a notorious alchemist named Konrad Dipple had discovered a human body
 Experiments with, but my Shelley did not mention this journey so that her claim to realism is maintained
 In a recent literary essay AJ Day justified Floreshu's claim that Mary Shelley knew about Castle Frankenstein and had gone there before writing her novel
 Dey cites Mary Shelley's "missing" documents that allegedly mention Frankenstein Castle

 John Milton's epic Paradise Lost is considered a major influence on Mary Shelley
 Milton has often referred to God as "the Victor" in Paradise Lost, and for Shelley, Victor is like God because he too creates life
 iske alaava, shelli dwaara diya gaya daitya kaa varnan paradise lost main shaitan ke charitra se kaaphi had tak mail khaataa he or daitya is mahakavy ko padhane ke baad yahaan tak kahata he ki vah usamen shaitan ke charitra se samanubhuti rakhata he
 There are also many similarities between Victor and Meri's husband, Percy Shelley
 victor, percy shelli kaa upnaam tha, unhone apni bahan elizabeth ke saath milakar likhe gaye kavitaaon ke ek sangrah kaa naam original poitry by victor and kazair rakhaa tha
 It has been speculated that Percy was considered ideal by Mary Shelley for Victor Frankenstein's character, as Percy "did many experiments with electrical and magnetic power and with gunpowder and other chemicals" in Aiton, and his room in Oxford
 Scientists were full of instruments
 percy shelli, oonchi raajnneetik pahunch ke ek amir jagirdaar ke bade bete the or kasal goring ke pehle upasamant, sar byshi shelli or erandal ke 10wein samant, richard fitzlan ke vanshaj the
 Victor's family was also one of the domineering families of the area and his ancestors used to be royalty

 Victor had a sister named Elizabeth
 22 farvari 1815 ne samay se do maheene pehle ek bachche ko janm diya jisaki do hafte baad mrityu ho gai
 Percy did not pay much attention to the condition of this precocious child and Percy's relationship with his half-sister Clary began to grow
 When Victor saw that the monster was alive, he left the room and ran away, though the monster moved towards Victor as a newborn child moves towards his parents
 victor kaa daitya ke prati daayitv, is upanyaas kii mukhya vishay-vastu he
 The Modern Prometheus is the subtitle of the novel
 Prometheus, according to Greek mythology, was the god who created mankind
 vah promethius hi tha jisane swarg se aagni churaakar maanav ko di thi
 When Zeus, the king of the gods, came to know of this, he tied Prometheus with a rock, where a predatory bird would come and eat it, as a punishment, but it would grow again and the bird would come back the next day The account was, in the end, Prometheus was freed by Herakles from this bond
 promethius latin main bhi sunaae janaa vaala ek puranic katha he lekin kahani bilkul alag he
 In this story Prometheus creates a human from soil and water, an important theme in Frankenstein as Victor also violates the laws of nature and as a result his creation punishes him
 promethius kii unani puranic katha main jo devtaa he, vah victor francnstin se tulya he, jis tarah victor nae taur tareekon se maanav kaa srijan karata he thik usee hi tarah devtaa bhi maanav jati kaa srijan karata he
 In a way, Victor snatched away the secret of human creation from God, just as God had stolen fire from heaven and handed it to man
 victor auki devtaa donon hi apane karmon kii sazaa pate hai
 Victor has to suffer a lot due to the death of his relatives and he also fears that his creation will kill him
 meri shelli ke liye promethius koi nayak nahin tha balki kuch-kuch shaitan kii tarah tha, jise vah maanav ko aag dene kaa doshi maanati thi or jisaki vajah se maanav jati ko maance khaane kii buree lat lag gai 
 is daawey ke prati meri kaa samarthan, upanyaas ke 17wein adhyay main dekhne ko miltaa he, jahaan "daitya" victor francnstin se kahata he: "meraa bhojan manushya nahin he; main apane pet ke liye memne or bachche ko nahin martha; mere poshan ke liye ber or banjufal hi kaaphi hai
 "for artists of the romantic period in general, Prometheus' gift to humans reflects two great impractical promises of the 18th century: the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, which contained both great promises and untold untold fears
 byran ko ashilas ke naatak promethius bound se khaasaa lagaav tha or percy shelli jald hi apana promethius anbound likhane vaale the
 The term "modern Prometheus" was coined by Emmanuel Cant, in which he referred to Benjamin Franklin and his electrical experiments conducted during that time
 shelli ne apane upanyaas main kai alag sroton kaa samavesh kiya, jinamein se ek thi ovid kii promithian dantakatha
 In the novel, John Milton's Paradise Lost and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "the Rhym of the Ancient Mariner", the books that the monster finds in the cabin, are clearly reflected in the novel
 saath hi shelli dampatti ne wiliam thomas bechford ke gothic upanyaas vaithek ko padhaa tha
 Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft is mentioned in many places in Frankenstein and her main book "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman", which describes the lack of equal education in men and women
 apni maa ke vichaaron ko apane kaam main shaamil karnaa bhi upanyaas ke srijan or maatrutiv kii vishay-vastu se hi judaa he
 Mary may have also drawn some inspiration for Frankenstein's character from Humphrey Davy's book Elements of Chemical Philosophy, in which Davy writes that "science has 


 given humans many powers that can be called creative; and which This has enabled him to change and improve the animals around him
 

" Shelley mentions a discussion of her novel by herself when she cites the extreme politics of her father William Godwin
 shelli ke upanyaas main ek jagah daitya or victor ek himand par aamane-saamne aate hai
 The monster describes his feelings of loneliness and exclusion
 victor phir bhi nahin dekh paata he ki usne hi is daitya kaa bahishkaar kiya tha or yah uskaa daayitv banataa tha ki vah us daitya ko pyaar kare or usko apana kuch samay de, jaisaa ki bachapan main uske mata-pita ne uske liye kiya tha
 Why does Victor have such isolation? Why does he not see himself as a father? In an essay titled The Nightmare of Romantic Idealism, the author states, "when Frankenstein becomes a father, he easily forgets his duty to children, being a creator, he lacks a virtue and that quality is for him
 He praises his parents: He was aware that he had an obligation to the one he gave birth to
 

" yah lekhak yah bhi kahata he ki " jindagi main ek vyask kii bhoomika ko sweekaar karne se inkaar karke vah srijan kii shakti ko kaayam rakhata he
 But at the same time he is also completely irresponsible and does not dare to bear the consequences of his actions
 " yah vaakya apni rachana ke prati victor kii maansikta kaa varnan karte hai
 Unfortunately, Frankenstein's gentle childhood did not prepare him for the real world
 use badha hokar apane karmon kii zimmdari uthaane kii kabhi zarurat nahin padi
 francnstin srujankarta or srijan ke bich ke rishton ko dhundne kii koshish karata he or saath hi parijanon or samaaj ke pyaar or sweekruti kii vaishvik zarurat ko bhi bayaan karata he
 The boycott of his creation by Victor makes the monster feel ostracized and gives rise to a feeling of anger and regret within that monster and in a violent reaction he kills those who were very close to Victor, this sequence goes on till the end Is when Victor himself dies and the monster goes to destroy himself
 francnstin kii ek prachlit vishay-vastu akelaapan or manushya par hone vaale akelepan ke prabhaav hai
 This theme is illustrated through the thoughts and experiences of the novel's three main characters: Walton, Frankenstein, and the monster
 kahani kii shuruuaat main walton ke patr uski akelepan kii bhaawanaaon se bhare hai kyonki vah jis saahasik abhiyaan par niklaa tha usamen kuch rochak nahin rah gaya tha
 Victor experiences fear and discomfort throughout the book
 kahani kii shuruyaat main victor kaa kaary use uske parivaar se alag kar detaa he
 He spends many years in solitude
 kahani main aage chalakar jab uske parijan or dost marane lagate hai to uske anubhav or bhi kadave jate hai
 He has said, "this mood has consumed my health, which was completely cured after surviving the first stroke
 maine insaan ke chehre se kinaaraa kar liya tha; khushi se bhari har ek awaz mujhe katati thi; ekantavaas hi meraa iklauta sahaara tha- ghanghor andhera— maut kii tarah sannata"
 francnstin ne isi tarah kii bhaawanaaon ko phir vyakt kiya jab usne kaha "duniya ke ek sabase ghinaune kaam main lipt, main akelepan main dub gaya tha, jahaan koi bhi ek pal ke liye meraa dhyaan bhatka nahin saktaa tha, meri icchhaaen mar chukin thim, main baichen or ghabaraane laga tha
 "the monster describes how his loneliness changed him when he says" i cannot believe that i am the one whose thoughts were once filled with superior and perfect beauty and goodness
 lekin aisa bhi he, ki ek patit farista ek vidweshpurna shaitan ban jaataa he
 Yet in his listlessness, God and man had friends of that enemy; But I'm Still Alone "
 Shelley was clearly exploring this subject because loneliness is an important inspiration for her main characters
 nitemir: berth of horer main christopher fraling is vishya-vastu kii charchaa upanyaas main abhivyakt jeevachhedan ke vipareet karte hai, kyonki shelli shaakaahaari thim
 In the third chapter, Victor writes that he "tortured a living being in order to infuse life into abyss
" And the monster says: "my food is not human; i do not kill the lamb and the child for my stomach

 In his deliberation, this story is a study of Victor's moral decay and aspects of the scientific hypothesis in this story are Victor's imagination

 Merry Shelley's leading scholar does not give much speculation to this conjecture, although it has been enthusiastically praised by critic Camille Paglia and sharply criticized by Jermaine Greer
 delaware vishvavidhyalay main angrezi ke professor charlas i robinsan ne 2008 main prakashit francnstin ke apane sanskaran main is vivaadit lekhan ko kuch had tak samarthan diya he, robinsan ne frangconstin kii hastlipiyon ko dobaaraa padhaa or unamem percy shelli dwaara kii gai madad ko manyata di
 Initially, the reviewers did not like this book much, as well as many speculations about who is its real author
 sar walter scot ne likhaa ki "sabase badhkar, yah kaary hamen prabhaavshaalee laga kyonki yah lekhak kii vaastavik nipunata or vyakt karne kii khushnuma shakti kaa andaaza detaa he", haalanki zyaadaatar samalochakon ne ise "betukepan kaa ek bhayanak or ghinaune utak mana"
 Despite such criticisms, Frankenstein quickly gained fame
 It became even more famous after being adopted by many plays and theaters - Mary Shelley also saw Richard Brinsley Peak's play Preamption: Or the Fate of Frankenstein, in 1823
 The French translation of Frankenstein was published only in 1821 1818 main gumnaam prakaashan ke baad se hi francnstin kii bahut prashansa bhi hui he or aalochana bhi

 The Belle Assembly called the novel a "bold hypothesis"
 The Quarterly Review stated that "the author has the power of both imagination and language"
 Sir Walter Scott, writing in Blackwood Ediberg Magazine, congratulated, "the author's genuine mastery and pleasant power of expression", although he was less convinced of the way the monster acquired knowledge of the world and language
 da edinburgh magazine or litrery misaleni ne ummid vyakt kii ki "vah is lekhak ke or upanyaas chahenge"
 In two other reviews where it appears that the author is the daughter of William Godwin, criticism of the novel is an attack on Mary Shelley's feminine nature
 british aalochak ne upanyaas kii kamiyon ko lekhak kii galati bataaya he; "isaki lekhak, hamaare mutabik, ek stri he, yah uskaa kshobh he or yahi is upanyaas kii sabase badi galati he; lekin agar vah lekhika apane ling kii saumyata ko bhul jaae, to hamen aisa koi kaaran nazar nahin aata he ki kyon; or isliye ham is upanyaas ko aage bina kisi tippanee ke khaarij karte hai
 "
 The Literary Panorama and the National Register attacked the novel, calling it" a copy of Mr
 Godwin's novels "written by" the daughter of a famous novelist "
 in shuruuaati asweekrutiyon ke baavjood, 20veen shatabadi ke madhya ke baad se is upanyaas ko aalochakon ne kaaphi pasand kiya he
 Leading critics such as MA Goldberg and Harold Bloom have praised the novel's "aesthetic and moral" significance, and in recent years the novel has become a popular subject for psychoanalytic and feminist criticism
 aaj yah upanyaas aamtaur par romani or gothic sahitya or vaigyanik pariklpana kaa aitihaasik kaary mana jaataa he

 Unlike the monster that was introduced earlier, it has also transformed the monster into a sensational, nonhuman creature

 When the world persecutes him, a sense of malice arises in his mind
 ant main victor vigyaan ke gyaan ko sakshat shaitan or khatarnaak rup se aakarshak bataata he
 However, soon after the book was published, theater directors began to find difficulty in presenting this story in scenes
 During the demonstrations that began in 1823, playwrights began to believe that to present this novel on stage, the intuitions of the scientist and the monster would have to be eliminated
 The monster became the star of events due to its sensational violent antics
 vahiin victor ko ek bevakoof kii tarah pesh kiya jane laga jo sirf prakruti ke rahasyon main ulajhaa rahata tha

 Silent films kept trying to add life to the story
 Early films such as Edison managed to stick to the contents of the company's one-reel Frankenstein and Life Without Soul novels
 However, in 1931, James Veil directed a film which completely reversed the story
 While working in Universe Cinema, Vail's film added many elements to the narrative that modern audiences today know best: the picture of "dr
" Frankenstein, who was initially a naive, young student; a character resembling Igor, who accidentally brings the mind of a criminal to his master while collecting body parts; And a sensational view of a creation that focuses on electric power rather than a chemical process

 Nhatki India is an English-language newspaper published in India
 bhashavigyaan ke antargat arthvigyaan yaa 'shabdaarthvigyaan' shabdon ke arth se sambandhit vidha he
 The study of the meaning of words and sentences in the realm of language is called semantics
 unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh se pehle arth-vigyaan ko ek alag anushaasan ke rup main manyata nahin thi
 The French philosopher Michel Brill founded this discipline and named it 'cementics'
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main fardinaind da sasyur dwaara pravartit bhashaai kranti ke baad se cementics ke pair samaaj-vigyaan main jamate chale gayi
 The first task of cementics is to identify linguistic categories and interpret them in appropriate terminology
 upar se sahaj par bheetar se pechida lagane vaali arth- sambandhi kavayaden cementics kii madad ke bina nahin ho saktin
 For example, the usefulness of cementics can be ascertained by looking at the difference in meaning between 'mortal is people' and 'mortal was Gandhi'
 duusare vaakya kaa nihitarth yah he ki gandhi ko amar mana jaataa tha yaa gandhi jaise log bhi nashwar hote hai
 Cementics explores how language works to make this difference of meaning
 vicitra baat yah he ki arth-vigyaan par shuruyaat main bhashaa-shastriyon bajaay ne gahari daali
 From the sixties linguists began to outline two basic types of linguistic meanings
 mana gaya ki arth kii pehali kism to bhashaai rup main hi sahjaat hoti he
 The second type is related to the interaction between the form spoken and the context of that expression
 ke arth-nirupan teen ke vibhedon ke tahat kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The first of these is the difference between perception and context
 doosraa he shabd ke arth or vaakya ke arth kaa bhed
 The third is the difference between text and context
 is tisare antar ko ab cementics se alag karke bhashaa-shastriyon ne pregamatics ke rup main nayaa anushaasan bana diya gaya he
 Under Cementics, the language that is studied is called the target language and the language in which it is interpreted is called the metalingual
 ek lakshya-bhashaa apni vyakhya ke metaalenguage bhoomika adaa sakati he
 In the history of linguistics, the metaphorical exercises were first word-centered, then they were sentence-centered and then they became text-centered
 in teenon prakriyaaon ne media-adhyayan, saahityalochana, vyaakhyaatmak samajashaastra or sangyanatmak vigyaan ke anushasano ko prabhavit kiya he
 Cementics raises the question whether the meaning of a word should be identified within the scope of the language or help is also taken from outside its scope for interpretation
 masalan, kursi kaa matlab hamen pataa he, par, yah arth ham kis prakaar hasil karte hai? ham kah sakate han ki kursi par baitha jaataa he
 However, within the language the meaning of the chair is also assumed with its relation to other meanings such as furniture, table, seat or bench
 in shabdon ke saath rakh kar baithne ke liye kaam aane vaali kursi kaa arth-grahan alag ho jaataa he
 Another example of the difference between perception and reference is the planet Venus or Venus
 ise bhor kaa tara bhi kaha jaataa he or sandhya-tara bhi, kyonki isaki chamak subah bhi dikhaayi padati he or raat main bhi
 In this way Venus, the morning star and evening star are three names of the same thing
 lekin sandarbh ek hi hote hue bhi teenon ko alag-alag bodh ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The emphasis of cementics is less on context and more on perception, because it wants to eclipse, so that the understanding of reality can also be achieved through language and for that, culture, history and other physical processes Is not important
 bhashaa ke bheetar shabdaarth praapt karne ke liye cementics main teen mukhya sambandhon samanarthak, vilomarthak or hyponomical kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Hyponimical categories are those that include word expressions
 jaise, kutta kisi billi, bandar, jiraph yaa khargosh kii tarah ek pashu bhi he or saath main vah terrior, hound, german sheoard yaa ritreaver bhi ho saktaa he
 It is worth noting that these three forms are used to create meaning within a well-defined linguistic system, but this does not mean that social and community processes of meaning-making and meaning-making are also pertinent
 masalan, koi aisa samudaay bhi ho saktaa he jo in teen sambandhon ke bina arthath bhashaa ke daayre ke baahar shabdon kii arth-rachana karata ho
 In North American, Hopi is such that the same word is used instead of different for all things except birds
 is kabeeley ke log machhar, gubbaaraa or hawaii jahaaz yaa aisi hi kisi chiz ko ‘masaytaka’ naam dete hai
 Taking sentences through sentences also comes under the scope of cementics
 ‘ramesh ne umesh se makaan karidaa’ darasal ‘umesh ne ramesh ko makaan bechaa’ kaa samanarthak he
 a similar synonym is between 'the police have arrested the agitators' and 'the agitators have been arrested by the police'
 isi tarah vaakyon ke bich duusare arth-sambandh banate hai
 For example, the connection between 'osama bin Laden killed at the hands of American commando unit' and 'osama bin Laden killed' can be seen
 agar pehle vaakya ke mutabik america commando unit ne osama ko vastav main maar daalaa he, to doosraa vaakya bhi jis yatharth kaa nirupan karnaa chahta he use sach maan liya jayega
 In addition to the dependence of one sentence on the other in terms of meaning, the sentences also depend on the pre-recognition inherent in it for its meaning
 jaise : ‘raksha mantralay ke ek vaktavy ke anusaar bharat ko un shaktiyon kaa prayog karnaa chahie jinase pakistan ko seemaa-paar se hone vaale antakawaad ko protsaahit karne se roka ja sake’
 There are two pre-beliefs in this sentence: first, India has the necessary powers and second, Pakistan is promoting cross-border terrorism
 pichley das saal main cementics or pregamatics ke kshetron main jabardast bhashaa-shastreey kaam hua he
 These semantic exercises that distinguish between the meanings of sentences and words may seem trivial from the top, but their importance cannot be denied to reveal the underlying ideological implications and contrivances in a text
 cementics or pregamatics kaa sahaara lekar raajnneeti-vigyaan ke kai padon main hue arth sambandhi parivartanon kaa adhyayan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, democracy has been interpreted as a system of disorganized and chaotic system of ordinary people or their crowd for a long time since the time of Aristotle
 lekin aaj loktantr ek vyavasthit kriyavidhi ke mutabik kaam karne vaali vyavastha ke arth main rudh ho gaya he
 Therefore, as soon as someone demands direct intervention in the processes of demand or movement, it starts to be declared a threat to the system
 bharat main jaiprakash narayan ke netritv main chale sampoorn kranti andolan ne pratinidhi vaapasi ke adhikaar kii maang karke aisi hi arth-sambandhi bechainiyaan paidaa kii thim
 The anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare has also introduced economic problems related to democracy
 ab yah bhashaa-shastriyon or loktantr ke chintakon kaa kaam he ki ve loktantr ke arth main aaye is parivartan kii arth-vaigyanik vyakhya karen
