 Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said that the US stand on the issue was clearly determined by his illegal court

 darasal, down toun or dal ke ilaake ke logon kii ye aam shikaayat nazar ai ki bachaav se lekar raahat tak, inaki madad ke liye koi nahin aayaa
 According to them, the media of the Army and Air Force aircraft, helicopters and NDRF boarded the entire picture, as if relief and rescue had reached every needy
 jab pani ufaan par tha tab kii baat to samaj main aati he ki helicopter yaa boat ke sahare hi reporting ho sakati thi or report vahi hoti jo helicopter yaa boat se dikhataa
 But the complaint here is that even after the water has receded, the media did not reach them directly
 bas raahat or bachaav kaam ke bakhaan main laga rahaa
 The people of the down town were stigmatized by making the Stone Story the largest on a helicopter
 jabaki inke gusse ke peeche kii vajah ko kahin koi jagah nahin mili
 The frustration stemmed from helplessness turned into aggression
 kai mediakarmi pit gaye
 Although this cannot be justified from anywhere, they also believe this
 is daure main ek baat baar-baar sunne ko mili
 Do anything for them, they are not going to be yours
 badqismati se kuch mediakarmi bhi is khyaal ke dikhe
 i asked those who believe that there is flood in UP and Bihar
 unhone kaha, haa aati he
 i asked, there is relief and rescue work there
 jawaab aayaa, haa hota he
 Then i asked that too many people complain about not reaching there
 jawaab aayaa, haa karte hai
 In displeasure, DM-CM-PM shout slogans, yes
 
 
 to phir agar yahaan raahat or bachaav ke kaam ko lekar asantosh he, to ise kisi or chashme se dekhne kii kya zarurat he? It is true that government help has not reached many people and people are angry
 isi mauqe ko algaavvaadi taaqatein bhunaane kii koshish main hai
 There is a need for greater alertness and sensitivity from the government and the media so that they do not succeed

 Former Bihar minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tej Pratap Yadav has tweeted a tweet on his official Twitter account on the same issue

 He should face the challenges faced while continuing to hold the post of party president
 desh ko aapke jaise yuva netritv kii jarurat he
 With this tweet, Tej Pratap has used the 'I support Rahul Gandhi' hashtag
 tej pratap yadav loksabhaa chunaav main nahin khadey hue lekin chunaav ke dauraan prachaar karte rahe
 Let me tell you, after the bitter defeat of RJD (RJD) in Bihar, the whole party is in a hurry

 In Bihar, BJP-JDU-LJP alliance held 39 seats, while Mahagathdhan got one seat
 bihar main rajd ne 20, congress ne 9, upendra kushvaha kii RLSP ne 5, jeethanram maanjhi kii ham ne 3 or san of mallaah mukesh saahani kii VIP ne teen siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf Chief Imran Khan has taken oath as the 22nd Prime Minister on Saturday
 imran kii sarkaar shanti, vikaas or padosiyon ke saath achche rishton jaise maamalon par baatcheet karegi
 Imran Khan had also said that his government will also solve important issues like Kashmir
 pakistan kii sutron ne ummid jataai he ki tazakastan kii rajdhani dushambe main sitambar maah ke aakhir main yojit shanghai sahyog sanghathan shikhar sammelan (SCO) mempiem modiorapakistanke pradhanmantri imran khan kii pehali mulaakaat hone kii ummid he
 However, according to Indian government sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not have a meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in September
 piem modi june main chingdao main rashtrapramukhon ke essio sammelan main hissaa le chuke hai, isliye sitambar main hone vaale kaarykram main bharat kii ore se raashtrapati ramnath kovind hissaa le sakate hai
 According to Pakistan's diplomatic sources, both India and Pakistan will have to sit and talk together to improve relations
 aapas main baatcheet se pehle koi shart nahin hogi
 Islamabad is the new platform in the world to organize a SAARC summit with the new government in Pakistan
 pakistan ke rajanyik sutron ke mutabik siachin or sarkreek jaise muddon ko jald hal kiya ja saktaa he
 Whereas the issue of Kashmir will take time to resolve
 pakistan kashmir ke alaava anya maamalon main faisla karne ke liye taiyaar he
 Pakistan said that no hope is possible without initiating dialogue, both countries need to move forward politically
 bharat or pakistan ko un maamalon kaa samaadhaan nikaalnaa chahie, jinhen donon desh milakar hal kar sakate hai
 Although the long-standing Kashmir issue will not be resolved so soon, but india-pakistan relations will get an opportunity to improve that the two countries are not enemies of each other
 gauratlab he ki pakistan ne bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara imran khan ko phone karke badhai dene kaa swaagat kiya tha
 Pakistan had said that this would raise hopes of paving the way for bilateral talks
 pakistan ke videsh vibhaag ke pravaktaa mohammad faijal ne kaha tha ki unhen ummid he ki phone par baatcheet se dakshin asian kshetreey sahyog sanghathan (saarc) ke sadsy deshon ke bich sambandh sudhaarney main madad milegi
 Explain that there has been a weakness in the relations of SAARC member countries with Islamabad since the 19th Summit in Pakistan in 2016
 
 The conference was canceled after India boycotted it as Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Bhutan also refused to attend
 maharashtra main dalit-muslim ekta kii kavayadamaharashtra main 14% dalit or 12 % muslimowaisi-ambedkar alag-alag ladenge chunaavmaharashtra main ol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin ke chif asaduddin ovaisi or dalit netaa prakaash ambedkar ke netritv vaali vanchit bahujan aghadi (vibie) ne milakar 'jai bhim-jai mim' kaa naaraa diya tha
 This exercise reminded the dalit-muslim alliance of underworld don Haji Mastan and Dalit leader Jogendra Kawade three decades ago in Maharashtra
 maharashtra main yah koshish jameen par apni jaden jamaane se pehle hi bikharati najar aa rahi he
 Owaisi and Ambedkar, who contested the Lok Sabha elections together, have decided to fight separately in the assembly elections
 kya he muslim or dalit aabaadi kaa samikaranmaharashtra main 14 fisadi dalit or 12 fisadi muslim aabaadi he
 It is tried by many political parties to hold power with the help of these two communities
 dalit-muslim ekajute karne ke liye ab tak kai netaaon ne koshishen kii, lekin koi bhi ise dharaatal par nahin utaar sakaa he
 In such a situation, due to the rift in the political friendship of Owaisi and Ambedkar, both Dalits and Muslims are seen disappointed in the assembly elections
 is tarah 'jai bhim-jai mim' ke naare kii puri tarah se hawa nikalati najar aa rahi he
 The danger of splitting the vote due to the break-up of the alliance, says Imtiaz Jalil, Maharashtra Pradesh President of AIMIM, "the break-up of the alliance with Prakash Ambedkar will lead to a split of the Dalit and Muslim votes and both parties will suffer
 ' haalanki gathbandhan tuutane ke liye AIMIM prakaash ambedkar ko jimmedaar tehra rahi he
 While Prakash Ambedkar believes that the alliance is broken due to Owaisi's insistence and high seat demand
 saath hi unhen lagata he ki gathbandhan kii abhi puri tarah se sambhaavna khatm nahin hui hai
 Explain that in the Lok Sabha elections this year, Owaisi's party AIMIM, along with Prakash Ambedkar, had managed to win the Aurangabad parliamentary seat in Maharashtra
 saath hi pradesh main 14 fisadi vot hasil karke is gathbandhan ne sabko hairaan kar diya tha
 Due to the owaisi-ambedkar alliance, the congress-ncp lost in 12 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra
 vidhansabha main kar sakate thebada ulatferraajnneetik vishleshak sanjeev chandan kehete hai ki maharashtra main dalit or muslim donon samudaay kii saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik haalat ek jaisi he, lekin kai baar ye bhi dekha gaya he ki donon samudaay ek duusare ke aamane-saamne aa jate hai
 Also, people who lead both communities in Maharashtra also take such decisions, due to which the two communities are unable to come together
 aise main prakaash ambedkar kii jimmedaari banati he ki dalit-muslim ekajutata ke liye bada dil dikhaaen
 Sanjeev Chandan says that the alliance between Ambedkar and Owaisi may perform better in the assembly elections than in the Lok Sabha elections
 ovaisi kii party ne kai chote str ke chunaavon main bhi jeet hasil kii he
 AIMIM managed to win 25 councilors in Aurangabad municipality
 marathavada ke muslim samaaj main party kii pakad acchhee he, aise main dalit samudaay ke saath milakar wo bada raajnneetik ulatpher kar sakati thi
 It has been alleged that bjp's help is a serious charge against Prakash Ambedkar and Asaduddin Owaisi that these two leaders benefit BJP by cutting votes of other parties
 haalanki donon netaa isse inkaar karte hue kehete hai ki wo apni vichaardhaara ke mutabik raajnneeti karte hai, isse agar kisi dal ko phayda miltaa he to ye unki chintaa nahin he
 The vote of the Dalits benefits the BJP
 Advocate Firdaus Mirza says that there are two types of Dalit community in Maharashtra
 inamen ek ambedkarwaadi he to doosraa hindutvvaadi
 The Dalit community, leaning towards Hindutva, is closely associated with BJP and Shiv Sena
 iske alaava maharashtra main ambedkarwaadiyon kii kai partiyaan hai, jinamein se ramdaas athavle gut pehle se hi bijepi ke saath he
 Apart from this, there are several parties including BSP and Prakash Ambedkar, among whom there is a possibility of dividing Dalit votes
 maharashtra kii siyasat par najar rakhane vaale lekhak sambhaaji bhagat kehete hai ki maharashtra ke maujuuda raajnneetik maahaul main dalit-muslim donon ekajute hona chaahate hai
 But Prakash Ambedkar and Owaisi have their own political agendas, due to which the two have separated
 ab dalit-muslim samudaay ke saamne sawaal khadaa ho gaya he ki wo kahaan jaae? mana ja rahaa he ki bada tabaka congress-ensipi kii ore rukh kar saktaa he
 His cadre is openly going to the Congress leaving Prakash Ambedkar with him
 musalamaanon kii koi raajnneetik samaj nahinmaharashtra ke saamaajik kaaryakarta amir ali ajaani kehete hai ki maharashtra kaa dalit samudaay desh ke baaki rajyon ke daliton se zyada raajnneetik, saamaajik or vaicharik rup se sajag he
 Whereas the Muslim community does not see any social and political thinking of its own
 isiilie donon samudaay ke bich maharashtra main koi ekajutata nahin ban paa rahi he
 Prakash Ambedkar and Asaduddin Owaisi may do Jai Bhim and Jai Mim, but these two leaders have never campaigned for solidarity at the grassroots level
 dalit chintak ashok meshram kehete hai ki asaduddin ovaisi kaa ambedkarwaad se dur-dur tak vaasta nahin he
 Although dalit-muslims were coming together in the Lok Sabha elections with Prakash Ambedkar and Owaisi, the decision of the two leaders has once again made it difficult for them
 agar ye donon ek saath aate to maharashtra ke vidarbha kaa siyaasi sameekaran badal saktaa tha
 In 84, before Mastan and Kawade took the initiative, after the 1984 Bhiwandi riots before Owaisi and Prakash Ambedkar, Haji Mastan Mirza and Jogendra Kawade, the Dalit leader and then president of People's Republican Party of India, formed the dalit-muslim Minority Security Federation in Maharashtra
 Was
 lekin 1994 main haji mastaan kii maut ke baad dalit-muslim prayog dhwast ho gaya tha
 After three decades, the dalit-muslim alliance formula seems to be standing on the same path once again
 swami ramdev ek nae vivaad main funs gaye hai

 chhattisgarh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main hameshaa kaante kaa muqabla hua he
 Only 2 in vote percentage between BJP and Congress in 2003 elections
 55 fisadi kaa antar tha
 Then in 2013 elections this difference was further reduced to just 0
 75 fisadi kaa rah gaya
 This time the BSP and former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi's surprise announcement of alliance in Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) has made the electoral battle more complicated
 aakhir chhattisgarh kii rajnatik partiyon ke liye is nae siyaasi talmail ke kya myne hai? desh main sabase lambii avadhi tak kisi rajya ke bhaajapai mukhyamantri ban chuke raman singh vahaan lagaataar chathi baar vaapasi karne kii jugat main hai
 It is not hidden from anyone that the Congress itself was trying to keep pace with the BSP
 udhar, sattarudh bhaajapa bhi is ghatnakram ko behad najadik se dekh rahi thi kyonki rajya kii kul 90 siton vaali vidhansabha main anusuchit jatiyon ke liye arakshit das siton main se philhal nau uski ke kabje main hai
 Giving information about this coordination in Lucknow, Mayawati said on September 20 that she has decided about it very thoughtfully
 gathjod main 35 siten basapa ko mili hai or 55 jessisi ko
 Jogi will be the face of the Chief Minister's post
 mayawati kii is baat kaa matlab yah he ki ve usee puraane tark ke aadhaar par chal rahi hai ki congress se talmail kii sthiti main basapa kaa vot to congress ko hastantarit ho jaataa he par congress kaa vot basapa ke haath nahin lagata
 In such a situation, the Congress takes advantage at the cost of the BSP
 lekin jessisi ke saath gathbandhan main anusuchit jatiyon kaa vot usko milane kii sambhaavna tagdi he kyonki jogi kii satnami samudaay main kareeb bhagwaan jaisi haisiyat he
 It is the largest community of scheduled castes in the state
 satnamiyon kaa madhya chhattisgarh kii 14 vidhansabha siton main khaasaa tagada jor he or vahaan unke 20-25 fisadi vot hai
 Apart from this, he has a good rank in half a dozen other seats
 in siton par is samudaay kaa puraa samarthan mil jaae or phir kacchi tathaa mallaah jaise chote samudaay bhi saath aa jaaen to basapa-jessisi ummidavaaron kii jeet sunishchit ho sakati he
 The situation of the JCC has been bad for some time due to the Congress breaking and taking its leaders here
 aise main basapa se talmail uske liye sanjivani sareekha he
 He may now have an important role in ticket sharing in central Chhattisgarh and perhaps even after the elections if the hung assembly is elected
 ajit jogi ke bete amit jogi kaa kahana he, "mayawati ji jaanati hai ki chhattisgarh main congress duubataa hua jahaaj he
 Only JCC can be an alternative to BJP
 '' jogi ke saath jane ke basapa ke faisle se bhauchak congress ab anusuchit jatiyon ko apane saath laane kii yojana par kaam kar rahi he
 Party strategists believe that Jogi can win 4-5 of the 14 seats in central Chhattisgarh with a good number of Scheduled Caste voters, but the real damage will be to the BJP as it currently holds 9 out of 10 reserved seats
 
 vipaksh ke netaa tii
 s
 singhdev kaa daawa he, "congress or bhaajapa kaa vot pratishat milakar 82 fisadi he
 That alliance will not matter
 chunaav main congress or bhaajapa main sidhi jang hogi
 "on September 20, State Congress President Bhupesh Baghel commented sharply," The CBI and ED pressure on the BSP has led to this alliance
 basapa bhaajapa ke kehane par ummidavaar khadi karti rahi he
 Now the BSP has been exposed by aligning with bjp's "B" team Jogi
 ''madhya chhattisgarh kii anusuchit jatiyon vaali siton par kaayam is anischitata ke kaaran bhaajapa ke liye ab yah jaruri ho gaya he ki vah rajya ke uttar or dakshin main janajaatiy siton par apni majbootee badaye
 The situation will not be as easy for him in the north as Singhdev, who came from the erstwhile royal family of Surguja, is very influential in that area
 isliye bhaajapa ummid laga rahi he ki vah dakshin main siton kii maujuuda baaji ko palat de, jahaan is samay congress ke paas aath or bhaajapa ke paas chaar siten hai
 The Raman Singh government, with a focus on 13 lakh tribal families, recently decided that it will give cash to the tendu leaf pluckers in the south districts of Sukma, Bijapur, Dantewada and Narayanpur by not giving bonus amount through direct benefit transfer (DBT)
 rajya ke uttari or dakshini ilaakon main bhaajapa tathaa congress main sidhi takkar hogi
 The BJP may also try to distribute the votes of Scheduled Castes
 yah kaam mushkil he par naammumkin nahin
 Satnamis also have many sects, such as Kabirpanthi
 unke netaa prakaash muni naam sahib ke raman singh se achche rishte hai
 In the first week of September, BJP President Amit Shah also met him
 bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh dharmlaal kowshik kaa kahana he, "bhaajapa 65 siten jeetne kii yojana par kaam kar rahi he
 This alliance is a setback for the Congress, the BJP is not going to make any difference to it
 ''bhaajapa berogari ke mudde par mushkil main ghir sakati he
 JCC has made this a big issue and Jogi has promised unemployment allowance based on educational qualification for the youth
 chhattisgadhi sammaan ko saamne rakhte hue unhone mul nivaasiyon ke liye bhi alag se naukariyaan dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 On the other hand, backward class people who supported the BJP in the last elections, especially Kurmi, may be overturned this time as they consider it a "now or never" chance for their leader Baghel to become Chief Minister
 are seeing
 baharhaal, india today ke rajnatik stock exange main kareeb 41 fisadi kii reating ke saath raman singh mukhyamantri pad ke liye sabase lokapriy daavedaar bane hue hai
 Baghel is his closest rival with a total rating of 21 per cent
 raman singh kii mahatvakankshi sanchaar kranti yojana se unhen vyapak samarthan mil saktaa he jisamen ve 55 lakh logon ko wais or data conection ke saath smartphone uplabdh kara rahe hai
 Some other gifts are also being distributed, such as pressure cookers and tiffin boxes in tribal areas
 dhan par nunatam samarthan mulya se upar 300 rupye prati quintal kaa bonus kareeb 16 lakh kisaanon ko pehle hi vitarit kiya ja chukaa he
 Despite these things, like every BJP campaign campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will remain the main campaigner of the party in Chhattisgarh too, especially in the urban seats of Raipur, Bilaspur, Durg and Raigad, where the party has a significant edge in the 2013 elections
 Was achieved
 party kaa daawa he ki uske vot pratishat main 2-3 fisadi ankon kaa ijapha hoga

 Harish Awasthi (name changed) is a young, enthusiastic software engineer working in a multinational company
 bina brake liye der raat tak kaam karnaa, amuman naashtaa na karnaa, fast food jamkar khaanaa, lunch ke dauraan soft drink kii badi-si bottle gatakana or kaam kaa tanaav bhagane ke liye niyamit antaraal par cigarette foonkna ek tarah se unki dincharya kaa hissaa ban chukaa he
 Until recently everything seemed to be going well
 phir ek din unhen seene main jalan hone lagi
 After lunch, the stomach started to swell, and they started having frequent toilet rotations
 yah sab dekhakar mujhe unani chikitsak hipocrates kaa yah jumala yaad aane laga: ‘sari bimaariyaan pet se hi shuru hoti hai
 'hippocrates may have said this more than two thousand years ago, but now we have started to understand how much address he was saying
 ek swasth vayask insaan kii sirf aant main hi kareeb 100 kharab bacteria paae jate hai
 These are of different types and diseases arise due to conflict between their interests
 pichley do dashakon main hui research se pataa chalaa he ki puri tarah swasth rahane ke liye aanton kaa swasth rahanaa kitna jaruri he
 Lifestyle has a tremendous impact on intestinal health
 zyada calories vaale junk food or sharaab kaa adhik seven, iske alaava reshedaar bhojan or hari subjiyan na khaane se pachan tantra ke rogon kaa khatra bad jaataa he or gastrointestinal system par bura asar padataa he
 Diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, obesity, liver fat accumulation, and peptic ulcers are among lifestyle-related gastrointestinal diseases
 akasar tanaav main rahane se bhi aapkaa haajama kharaab ho saktaa he
 When stressed, there is usually a release of hormones called adrenaline and cortisol from the adrenal glands
 tanaav kii vajah se puure pachan tantra main jalan hone lagati he jisase pachan nalee main sujan aa jaati he or is sabakaa nateeja yah hota he ki poshak tatwon kaa sharir ke kaam aana kam ho jaataa he
 Long-term stress can lead to digestive problems such as irritable bowel syndrome and stomach ulcers
 jaanch ke liye doctoron ke paas jane vaale rogiyon kii padtaal main yah baat saamne ai he ki gastroisophegal riflux (jeeiardi) ab pachan sambandhi saamaanya rog ban gaya he
 In GERD, the acid actually inside the stomach goes back to the esophagus (food pipe)
 isse seene main jalan to hoti hi he, ulti kii shikaayat bhi hoti he
 Apart from this, there are many problems of lungs, ears, nose or throat
 iske saath kai pareshaaniyaan judi hai
 For example, esophagus also has problems like blisters and contractions
 jeeiardi agar lambey samay tak rah gaya to ek nai avasthaa aa sakati he, jiskaa naam he barats oesophegus or iskaa agar samay par ilaaj na kiya gaya to oesophegus kaa cancer bhi ho saktaa he
 a slight change in lifestyle can be especially beneficial if there are mild abdominal but repeated complaints
 inamen bistar par sir ooncha rakhkar sona, tang kapade na pahananaa, vajan zyada hone par use ghataana, sharaab or cigarette kaa istemaal kam karnaa, khuraaq main badlaav karnaa, bhojan ke turant baad letne se bachanaa or sote samay khaane se bachanaa shaamil he
 Smoking and excessive use of alcohol increase the amount of acid returning to the esophagus, the amount of acid produced in the stomach also increases
 isse pet ke ulcer ke thik hone main bhi rukaawat aane lagati he
 Some recent studies have shown that smoking along with alcohol has a huge hand in damaging the liver and pancreas
 pankriyaaj har tarah ke bhojan ko pachaane vaala mahatvapurn ang he jabaki liver sharir main bhojan ke pachne ke baad uske avasorana ke liye jaruri he
 It is obvious that obesity in our country is increasing at a worrying level
 pittashay main pathari, sharaab ke alaava charbi vaale liver ke rog or gastroisophegal reflux jaise aanton ke kai rogon main motaape kaa bhi shartiya taur par haath he
 Digestive diseases cannot make room in the body, for this it is necessary that the weight should not be excessive
 vajan na bade, iske liye reshe vaale sabut anaaj, fal, hari subjiyan, kam charbi vaala gosht or usee tarah ke deyari utpaadon ke adhik seven ke saath paryaapt maatra main taral padaarth bhi lenaa chahie
 Eating too much at once can increase the pressure on the digestive tract
 isliye zyada behatar yah hoga ki din bhar main niyamit antaraal par thodi-thodi maatra main bhojan karte rahaa jaae
 In case of Hajme, if you feel any problem for a long time or seriously, then you should reach the hospital without any further delay and complete health checkup
 gastrointestinal rogon ke bare main jaruri jaankaree-gastrointestinal rogon ke kaaran:jivan style is tarah ke rog behisaab sharaab or cigarette pine, fast food zyada khaane or kaam ke vakt daftar main tanaavpurn sthitiyaan banane se hote hai
 Genetic Causes Recent studies have shown that due to any sudden change in genetic structure, diseases like pancreatitis and gallstones are more common
 aasapaas kaa parivesh or swatchta saaf-safai kii kami se hepatitis or tapedic jaise sankraman hote hai
 Precautionary measures: Take nutritious supplements, exercise, avoid smoking and alcohol consumption, besides keeping yourself clean, vaccines etc
 are also necessary
 pet, badi aant, liver cancer kii jaanch bhi karavaaen

 Sasikala Pushpa, in her petition, termed Jayalalithaa's death as 'suspicious'
 unhone gambhir aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki jayalalita kii beemaari se lekar maut tak sab kuch parde main rakhaa gaya
 He said that it was also said that after seeing Jayalalithaa's body it seemed that she was already dead and everything is being hidden from the public

 Recently, the Madras High Court judge has also said about the CBI investigation into Jayalalithaa's death, it is noteworthy that 68-year-old Jayalalithaa was admitted to Apollo Hospital in Chennai on 22 September due to fever and lack of body water

 karunanidhi ke nidhan se bhale hi siyaasi shunya kii sthiti nahin he lekin donon netaaon kii viraasat sanbhaalane laayak nirvivaad netaa donon dalon main nahin hai
 This is the biggest challenge for the current leadership of both the parties and it is also an opportunity for parties like BJP, Congress as well as film stars like Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth to get their feet here, but the political mood of this state is somewhat different
 is
 jayalalita or karunanidhi ke rahete hue tamilnadu main congress yaa bhaajapa jaise rashtriya dal haashie par hi bane rahe
 Neither the organization of these national parties could be strengthened in the state, nor could any leader flourish

 The Congress has deemed it better than taking any such risk that it should be in alliance with the DMK so that it gets a strong partner from this southern state during and after the Lok Sabha elections
 ''bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah jab pichley maheene tamilnadu main bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kar rahe the to unhone kaha tha ki jo log kah rahe hai ki tamilnadu main bhaajapa kahaan he?ve chunaav ke baad iviem main bhaajapa ko dhund sakate hai

 This claim of BJP is when it got about 5 percent votes in the last Lok Sabha election
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa daawa he ki pichley chunaav main kitna fisadi vot mila, yah mahatvapurn nahin he
 The important thing is that the bjp's organization has strengthened here in the last four years and the current state of the state is such that there can be an atmosphere of party's favor here

 It is clear that indirectly the BJP is playing an important role in the power of Tamil Nadu
 bhaajapa yahaan kitni prabhavi he, iskaa saboot is baat se miltaa he ki sansad main avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan or phir rajyasabha ke upasabhapati ke chunaav main bhaajapa ko annadramuk kaa bina shart samarthan mila
 There is a buzz in the political circles that with the Palaniswami and Panneerselvam camp, BJP should register a strong presence here by contesting elections in 2019
 bhaajapa or congress ke itar do filmi hastiyaan aisi bhi hai jo khud ko jayalalita yaa karunanidhi ke vikalp ke rup main sthapit karne kii khwaahish rakhti hai

 rajnikant ne party kii ghoshnaa to nahin kii he lekin unhone raajnneeti main aane kii ghoshnaa kar di he or party banane kii prakriya main hai
 He has raised a ray of hope for the BJP by talking about spiritual politics
 bhaajapa ko lagata he ki tamilnadu jaise rajya main aadhyatmik raajnneeti kii baat darasal paroksh rup se bhaajapa kii madadgaar sabit ho sakati he
 However, it is certain that the politics here will have a decisive impact in the 2019 general election
