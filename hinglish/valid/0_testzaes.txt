 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian
 unki rachanaaon main ve nayak hue, jise bhartiya samaaj achhut or ghrunit samajha tha
 He used the language of simple, easy and common language and presented his progressive ideas strongly to the society

 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more

 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye
 In the era in which Premchand took the pen, there was no solid legacy behind him nor was there any model of thought and progress, except in Bengali literature
 us samay bankim babu the, sharathchandra the or iske alaava tollstoy jaise rusi sahityakar the
 But by the time he composed a classic novel like Godan which is considered a modern classic
 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
 When the freedom movement of India was going on, the expression he gave to both Hindi and Urdu languages through narrative literature gave rise to political stirring, passion and movement to all and made him powerful and this also made his writing powerful
 premchand is arth main nishchit rup se hindi ke pehle pragatisheel lekhak kahe ja sakate hai
 In 1936, he addressed the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Association as the Chairman
 unka yahi bhaashan pragatisheel andolan ke ghoshnaa patr kaa aadhaar bana
 Premchand gave birth to a tradition of storytelling in Hindi and an entire generation followed in his footsteps, Renu, Nagarjuna and after him Srinath Singh has written stories of rural environment in the 50-60s, in a way that tradition of Premchand Comes in line with premchand ek krantikari rachanaakaar the, unhone na keval deshbhakti balki samaaj main vyaapt anek kuritiyon ko dekha or unako kahani ke madhyam se pehali baar logon ke samaksh rakhaa
 He began to portray all the problems of society at that time
 usamen dalit bhi aate hai, nari bhi aati hai
 All these subjects later became major discourses of Hindi literature

 motargadi chaalan se taatpary jameen par chalane vaali kisi gaadi ko niyantrit dhang se chalaanaa
 When a person starts buying a new car, then he has the desire to see how much speed the car catches
 lekin aisa karnaa khatre se khaali nahin hota
 He should not run more than 30 km per hour in the initial first 1000 km journey
 vaise to kaarkaanon main nirmaan ke baad prayek motor gaadi ke ingine ko thiye par baitha kar or chalaakar bhalee bhanti jaanch liya jaataa hai, lekin yah alpakaalik hi hota he
 Therefore, even after putting it in the car, all its bearings and parts are ruined by running it slowly for some time in the beginning
 aisa na karne se kai baar, ingine ke silinder, bering or shakti preshan yantra bahut garam hone se jal or anth kar itane kharaab ho sakate hai ki uni marammat karnaa asambhav ho jaay
 At this time they should also be given plenty of oil
 silinderon main bahut adhik tel dene se yahi haani hoti he ki vah phaltu tel jalakar, silinderon main carbon ke rup main jam jaataa he, jise pratham 1,000 kimi kii yatra ke baad hi saaf karnaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 Then later it becomes necessary to clean up after a journey of 4,000 km
 gaadi kii suraksha ke liye uparyukt saavdhaanee baratani hi chahie
 To become a successful motorist, it is not enough to drive the vehicle without crashing, using its control equipment and the market congestion
 pratham yogyata to ek aadh ghante main hi praapt kii ja sakati he
 The hallmark of a skilled driver is that at all times, on average, at the highest speed, taking full care of himself and the public's safety, he should handle the vehicle in such a way that the cost of wear, wear and tear of petrol etc
 is minimum Ho
 yah gun nirantar abhyaas se hi praapt hota he
 The driver must have a good knowledge of the width of his car so that he can get the vehicle out of the minimum space without hitting anything
 use apni gaadi or duusare vaahanon kii raftaar kii sahi atkal lagane kii yogyata honi chaahe
 While operating the vehicle, the control devices should be operated in such a way that their action is perfectly organized
 driver kii nigahen aage ke raste par lagbhag 100 me kii duuri tak faili rahani chahie or aavashyaktaa padane par uskaa haath, bina maarg se drushti hataae, sahi niyantrak upkaran par padana chahie
 The new driver's eyes should extend approximately 100 meters on the front track and his hand, if necessary, without sight, must fall to the correct controller device
 nae driveron ke saath durghatnaayen praaia: isaliye hoti he ki ve upkarnon ko dekhakar pakadaney ke liye apni drushti maarg se hataa lete hai
 This qualification is obtained only after traveling several hundred km
 driveron ko pair se chalaae janevaale upkarnon kii sthiti kaa bhi sahi gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Often the novice accidentally slips the foot on the accelerator pane in an attempt to press the maneuvered brake with the desire to stop the car at once, causing a massive crash
 kai driver bheed bhaad kii jagah par perechlit brake kaa hi adhik upyog kiya karte hai, lekin unhen bagali main lage haath brake kaa bhi upyog karnaa chahie
 Many times a car has to be stopped within a distance of eight to ten feet
 aisi sthiti main andaja na rahane par yadi driver haath brake ko tatolta hi rah jaae to durghatana hona nishchit he
 It is also necessary for the driver to know the highway rules
 yaad rakhana chahie ki sadak kii bai taraf kaa bhaag apni gaadi or dahni taraf kaa bhaag saamne se aaneko vaahanon main liye nishchit he
 In order to violate the vehicles moving in their own direction, they should leave their left side and leave their right side
 kisi ghoda, yaa baiylgaadee ke chaalak, athwa police ke sipaahi ke kehane par driver ko motor ekadam rokani chahie, sambhav he ki ghoda, yaa bail chaalak ke vash main na ho; yaa chalane main asamarth ho
 Signs of soldiers standing at crossroads should be followed immediately
 saath hi driveron ko chahie ki ve swayan kidar ko janaa chaahate hai, yah baat ishaare se pulisavaalon ko bhi bataa den
 Also tell the other drivers walking near you that they want to stop or turn to where
 aadhunik rajmargo ke chauraahon aadi par yatayaat ke niyantran ke liye sipaahi tainaat na kar bijli ke swachaalit sanket bhi laga die jate hai, at: unhen bhi samajhakar tanudasar kaary karnaa chahie
 Due to differences in the composition of trains made from different factories, there is also some variation in the method of commissioning them
 vishesh kar sharad ritu main kai gaadiyaan chaalu hote samay kathinaayee utpann kar detii hai, at: pehle se hi unke niyantrak upkarnon kaa samanjan uchit prakaar se kar lenaa chahie
 For example, the self-propelling device may or may not have been installed in the vehicle, the antagonist and flame lever of each vehicle should be properly adjusted beforehand
 yadi gaadi main parivartansheel jwalak yukti lagi ho, jisase bijli kii chinagaari pehle se athwa vilambit kar chodi ja sakati ho, to gaadi ko chaalu karte samay use kuch lambit kar dena chahie
 If the spark will be released before then, the compressed gas will burn before time, which will put a lot of emphasis on the engine's gazen-pin etc
 chaalu karte hi gear box ke liver ko tatasth sthiti main rakhana chahie or bagali ke haath brake ko bandhaa hua
 Then, open the petrol and install a flame switch, so that the circuit is also completed
 yadi aavashyak ho to corburator ko halake se thakathaka dena chahie, jisase uske prakoshth main petrol bhar jaae
 Now, if the self-propelled device is installed, then it should be turned on, otherwise it is only possible to rotate by hand, then first its hand should be rotated for two whole times, so that in one cylinder the gas of petrol is compressed and filled, which ignites There will be preparation for the second cylinder and there will be suction action in the second cylinder
 phir jab handls neeche kii taraf ho, tab use ekadam jatke ke saath upar kii taraf ghumana chahie, is prakar jwalan hokar ingine chal padegaa
 Instead of the empty engine running for a few minutes, when the heat reaches each part, the burden of the dispatch machine of the vehicle should be put on it
 yadi radiator ke saath jal parivahak shater bhi laga ho, to sardiyon main use bhi ek do minute tak band rakhana chahie, jisase jacket ke pani main halaki si ushnata aa jaae
 When the engine starts running properly by the above mentioned actions, pressing the clutch panel for two to four seconds should put the transmitting device of the car in the following gear
 is samay bagali kaa brake laga rahanaa chahie or ek pair ko twaritra falak par rakhkar klach ko dhire se laga dena chahie
 Then the brake should be released as soon as the engine accelerates
 is prakaar gaadi dhimi raftaar se aage badhane lagegi
 In many modern trains, a second gear is added immediately after it is commissioned
 nimna gear se duusare gear par badali karne ke liye klach falak ko thodaa hi dabaanaa chahie, puraa nahin
 At this time, the accelerator panel should be left free, keeping the gear lever in neutral position for a moment and giving it the government in high position
 iske baad klach ko dhire se laga dena chahie
 Then the accelerator panel should be suppressed, causing the engine to rotate as many times as before
 gaadi ko or adhik unche gear par lagane ke liye use uchit raftaar par chalane dete hue uparyukt sabhi prakriyaayein doharaani chahie
 The only difference would be that the gear lever has to stay in neutral position for a few more moments
 gear ko unchi athwa nichi sthiti main badalte samay ukt tatasthta kii avadhi prayek gaadi ke liye bhinn hua karti he
 Once the car is mounted on a high gear, its speed is made by an inertial resistor
 gaadi ke gear ko hameshaa puraa klach dabaakar hi badalanaa chahie| agar puraa klach bina dabaaye aap gear badalte hai to gear box jaldi karaab hone kii ashanka bani rahati he| As stated earlier, if the driver keeps his eyes on the road for about 100 meters ahead of the vehicle , then avoid gearing, hopping, turning, or climbing to change gear or slow the speed There is a lot of time to do etc
 and there is no need to stop the car from jerking by applying both brakes
 yadi gaadi ko kahin tehraana abhisht ho, to pehle uparodhi ko band kar dena or twaritra falak se pair hataa lenaa chahie, lekin klach ko lage rahane dena chahie
 In this way, when the engine is running powerless and empty due to the smooth speed of the car, it will work as a type of brake, which will automatically slow down the car
 phir ant main klach ko bhi chhudaakar haath athwa pair kaa brake yatha avasar laga dena chahie
 The gear lever should be neutralized and the hand brake tied as soon as the vehicle stops
 yadi gaadi ko kisi dhaal par khadaa karnaa pade, to bai taraf ke agle yaa pichley pahie ko karb pathar se atka dena chahie, is prakaar gaadi ludhakegi bhi nahin or brake par bhi adhik jor nahin dena hoga
 There are two things to be remembered in relation to stopping the car: driver log praaia: yah galati kiya karte hai ki chadhaai par chadhate samay jab gaadi mand padane lagati he, tab bahut der baad gear badalane kaa praytn karte hai
 Although modern vehicles have a lot of flexibility in function and they can cross spontaneously at higher gears when shorter and lighter plies, but climbing higher at higher gears puts undue emphasis on engines and power transmission devices
 yahi tarika to he ki jyon hi chadhaai aarambh honevaali ho, aavashyak nimna gear par preshan yantra ko daal diya jaae, jisase gaadi apane main kuch adhik shakti sanchit kar le or yah chadhaai par kaam aae
 There is a possibility of danger due to the lack of road ahead on the turns of the road
 at: acha tarika yahi he ki kisi bhi tej mode athwa saadhaaran ghumaav ke aane ke 100 yaa 150 me pehle se hi gaadi kii raftaar kramash: kuch mand kar di jaani chahie, jisase aavashyaktaa padane par gaadi ko saralata se jaldi hi roka ja sake or ghumaate samay stearing par adhik jor na pade
 Here the car should be moved slightly left from the middle of the road, because from the center, the front part can be seen from a distance of the road
 is prakaar stearing chakra dhire dhire ghumaane se mode aane par swat: hi gaadi bain taraf sahi chali jaati he
 Extreme caution is required when driving in crowds
 hamaare aasapaas chalanevaale vyakti kya karnaa chaahate hai, is baat kaa sahi andaja lagaana sadaiv sambhav nahin hota
 Therefore, walking slowly at such places and always be alert and horny etc
 should be played clearly
 aage chalate hue do vaahanon ke bich main se haakar aage nikalne k koshish nahin kerani chahie
 Slow moving vehicles should be violated only when no other vehicle is coming from the front
 kisi mode par ghoomte samay to aisa kabhi bhi nahin karnaa chahie
 a horn should always be played before skipping a standing vehicle
 prayek motor driver ko rajpath par gaadi chalaate samay, yadi vah apni kushal chahta he to, janhit ko drushti main rakhte hue kuch niyamon kaa paalan karnaa atyaavashyak he, jinka yahan sanket maatr kiya jaataa he: The license is given at a yearly or quarterly fee according to the horsepower of the motor vehicle, which the motorist should always keep with him while driving and show it to the policemen on demand
 prayek gaadi ke aage or peeche, ytaakar akruti kaa number plate laga rahanaa chahie, jisaki jameen kaali yaa safed or akshar nirdhaarit naap ke tathaa safed yaa kaale rang main likhe hone chahie
 Two white lamps should be placed on each train in such a way that the width of the incoming train should be estimated from a distance
 ek chota safed lamp peeche kii taraf number plate ko prakashit karte hue laga rahanaa chahie or saath hi ek laal batti bhi honi chahie
 The previous lamp must be lit half an hour after sunset and should keep burning till half an hour before sunrise
 aage ke agradip suryaast ke ek ghante baad jala dene chahie or suryoday ke ek ghante pehle buja dene chahie
 Speed restrictions - Motor vehicles should not run more than 30 km per hour on the adjacent roads of the population
 aabaadi ke kshatron main 15 kimi prati ghanta se tej na chalaane kaa praaia: niyam hota he
 These types of information are written on the information supporting the roads
 chaal niyantran or anya prakaar kii chetavaniyaan tathaa anya bhi kai prakaar kii suchnaayen praaia: yathasthaan lagaai jaati he, jinhen samajhakar gaadi ko sadaiv saavdhaneepurvak itani raftaar se chalaanaa chahie ki kisi prakaar kii durghatana na ho
 In the event of an accident, whether a motorist is directly related to an accident, or not, he should stop
 yadi pulisavaale usase koi poochtacha karen, to uskaa sachai se uttar dekar, apana naam or pataa bhi de dena chahie
 By writing a full description of the accident and the statements of the two witnesses, signature along with their names and addresses should also be obtained
 gadiyon kii takkar ho jane par us sthaan ko naapakar apni gaadi kii sahi sthiti tathaa anya sambandhit gadiyon kii sthiti ankit kar unki raftaar bhi likh leni chahie
 If any person was injured in the accident, it is the duty of all the drivers present at the site to take first aid of the injured to the nearest hospital, and also give necessary information to the police
 yadi gaadi kaa beemaa karavaaya hua ho, to ukt sab suchnaayen beemaa company ko bhi bhej deni chahie
 Train stop- For the convenience of the passengers, the train can be stopped for some time even on the highways and lanes, if there is no obstruction of traffic
 aise samay main gaadi ke ingine ko band kar brake laga dene chahie
 But remember that vehicles cannot be stopped for long on common routes
 bade shaharon main, khaas khaas jagahon par gaadi tehraane ke padaav banaae jate hai
 No matter how long the train can stop here
 jahaan aisa sthaan nikat ho gaadi ko vahiin rokna chahie

 medical collejon or vishvavidhyalayon main chikitsa snaatak paathyakram main dakhile ke samay bade paimaane par hone vaali dhaandhlee rokane kii maang lambey samay se kii ja rahi thi
 For this, it was being suggested to implement a centralized entrance examination system
 ejineering collejon main yah prakriya lagu thi magar nijee collejon or rajya sarkaron kii anichhaa ke chalate is disha main koi kadam nahin uthaaya ja paa rahaa tha
 Earlier this exam was called 'AIPMT'
 yah pariksha deshbhar main ek saath hoti thi
 Based on the marks obtained in this examination, students were admitted to medical institutions run by the Central Government
 lekin sarkaar ne paardarshita, medical shiksha main ucch maanak sthapit karne or chaatro ko kai parikshaon ke boj se bachaane ke liye desh bhar ke medical collejon main daakhile ke liye ek pariksha yojit karaane kaa faisla liya
 NEET entrance examination is done by Central Board of Secondary Education i
e
 CBSE
 chhipi baat nahin he ki chikitsa sansthaanon main daakhile ke liye hode lagi rahati he
 Since after studying medical science there is no problem of employment like that after other technical courses
 isliye paathyakram main daakhile ke liye kuch adhik bheed rahati he
 Since there is a provision of management quota in private institutions and the colleges themselves decide the conditions for admission, the children of people with money are occupied in most seats there
 in paathyakramon main munhmaangi rakam dene waalon kii qatari lagi rahati he
 Obviously, running a college for management has become a big earning business
 magar daakhile main paardarshita or vyaavhaarik vyavastha na hone ke chalate bahut saare medhaavi vidhyaarthiyon ko daakhile se vanchit hona padataa he
 The Supreme Court had ordered the implementation of NEET based on the consent of the Central Government, Medical Council of India and Central Board of Secondary Education
 magar kuch rajyon ko is par aapatti thi ki isse kshetreey bhashaa main samaan paathyakram taiyaar karne or pravesh parikshaayen yojit karaane aadi main mushkil aa sakati he
 On this basis, the Center prepared the notification
 magar kanoonee aadchan thi ki kya sarvocch nyaayalay ke kisi faisle ke khilaaf sarkaar adhyadesh laa sakati he? raashtrapati ne is par kanoonee salaah lee or aakhirkaar adhyadesh ko hari jhandi dikhaa di
 In this way, the rigging of quota will stop at the time of admission in medical institutions
 abhi tak nijee or sarkari collejon main management, enarai aadi ke liye jo cote nirdhaarit hai, un siton par college khud daakhile kii sharten tay karte hai
 But now all kinds of quota can be filled only through central examination

 After the 1700th century, as the Industrial Revolution grew at a rapid pace, there was also a considerable increase in population growth
 The rate of population growth in the last 50 years has been even faster and the main reason for this is the growth in the medical world and the significant increase in agricultural productivity, especially the progress made due to the Green Revolution between 1960 and 1995
 In 2007, the United Nations Population Division estimated that in the year 2055 the world population would cross the figure of 10 billion
 In the future, it is expected that the increase in the world's population will reach the peak and after that the population will start to decrease due to economic reasons, health concerns, indiscriminate use and depletion of land and environmental hazards
 There is also an 85% possibility that the world's population will stop increasing before the end of this century
 There is a 60% probability that the world's population will not exceed 10 billion people before the year 2100 and there is a 15% probability that the world's population will be less than the total population of the world at the end of the century
 For different regions, there will be considerable variation in the date and size of the largest population

 This would be useful if fertility control is seen as a personal decision of the individual and population control is seen as a government or state level regulation policy of population growth
 Fertility control is likely to occur when a person or couple or family takes steps to reduce or control their childbirth
 In the formulation given by Ansley Cole, three prerequisites have been given for continued reduction in reproduction: acceptance of choice calculated as a valid element of reproduction, known benefits from reduced reproduction and knowledge of effective methods of control and their use
 Skilled practice of doing
 Unlike societies that believe in natural reproduction, societies that wish to limit reproduction and have the resources available to do so

 At the social level, declining fertility is an inevitable consequence of the increasing secular education of women
 haalaanki, yah zaruri nahin he ki madhyam se ucch str tak ke prajnan niyantran main prajnan dar ko kam karnaa shaamil ho
 Even when comparing different societies which have adopted fertility control quite well, societies with equal fertility control ability can also give very different reproductive levels, which is related to the fact that small Or what is a personal and cultural choice for a large family or for the number of children

 It is also necessary to adopt policies that increase population as an aspect of population control and it is important to understand that the government does not want to stop population growth only as a form of population control
 To encourage population growth, the government can not only support immigration but also create additional children by pro-birth policies such as tax benefits, financial rewards, continuation of pay during holidays and helping to care for children

 So the Ottoman authorities of Lahore put the disputed son Aramshah of Qutb-ud-din Aibak to the throne of Lahore, but as a result of the opposition of the Turko chieftains and citizens of Delhi, Iltutmish, son-in-law of Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who was then the Subedar of Badaun, was invited to Delhi on the throne

 At the same time, the Khalifa also conferred upon him the title of 'sultan-e-azam'
