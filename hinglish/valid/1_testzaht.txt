htm aluminium ek rasinic tatv he jo dhaaturup main paaya jaataa he
 It is the most commonly found metal in the earth's crust
 aluminium kaa ek pramukh ayask he - boxit
 It is mainly made up of aluminum oxide, iron oxide and some other impurities
 bear prakram dwaara in ashuddhiyon ko dur kar diya jaataa he jisase sirf alumina batch jaataa he
 Pure aluminum is obtained from alumina by electrical decomposition
 aluminium dhaatu vidyut tathaa ooshmaa kaa chaalak tathaa kaafii halki hoti he
 Because of this it is used in making airplane parts
 bharat main jammu kashmir, mumbai, kolhapur, jabalpur, ranchi, sonbhadra, balaghat tathaa katni main boxit ke vishaal bhandar paae jate he
 Orissa-based Nalco is the world's cheapest aluminum manufacturer
 aluminium shwet rang kii ek dhaatu he
 The Latin word alumen and the English word alum mean alum
 is fitkaree main se jo dhaatu pruthak kii ja saki, uskaa naam aluminium padaa
 Our introduction to alum is very old
 kankshi, tuvari or saurashtraj iske puraane naam he
 Alum is in fact a double compound of both potassium sulfate and aluminum sulfate
 san 1754 main margraph ne yah pradarshit kiya ki jis mitti ko alumina kaha jaataa he, vah chooney se bhinn he
 Sir Humphrey Davy tried to separate the metal from alumia soil in 1807, but was not successful
 san 1825 main arsted ne aluminium chloride ko potacium sanras ke saath garam kiya or phir aswan karke paare ko uda diya
 There was a sparkle of metal in the powder that remained after doing this
 yahi dhaatu aluminium kahalaai
 In 1845, Frederick Wöhler used potassium metal as a reducing agent in the preparation of this metal
 use is dhaatu ke kuch chote-chote kan mili, jinaki pariksha karke usne bataaya ki yah nai dhaatu bahut halki he or iske taar khinche ja sakate hai
 Subsequently, in 1854, Devil prepared a good amount of this metal using sodium and sodium aluminum chloride
 us samay nai dhaatu hone ke kaaran aluminium kii ginati bahumoolya dhaatuon main kii jaati thi or iskaa upyog abharanon or alankaaron main hota tha
 In 1886, Charles Martin Hall in Ohio City isolated alumina mixtures in a smelled cryolite and an aluminum metal from it by electrification
 europe main bhi lagbhag isi varsh hero ne swatantra rup se isi prakaar yah dhaatu taiyaar kii
 The same hall-hero method is being used in the production of this metal nowadays
 halaki or sasti hone ke kaaran aluminium or usase bani mishra dhaatuon kaa prachlan tab se baraabar badhata chalaa ja rahaa he
 Two minerals are of special use for preparing aluminum metal
 ek to bauksoit or doosraa cryolite 
 Extensive deposits of bauxite have been found in the districts of Ranchi, Palamu, Jabalpur, Balaghat, Salem, Belgaum, Kolhapur, Thana etc
 in India

 In this, bauxite is absorbed with hot caustic soda solution to form sodium aluminate
 is aluminute ke vilyan ko chaan lete hai or isamen se phir alumina kaa avakshepan kar liya jaataa he
 
 alumina se aluminium dhaatu haul-hero-vidhi dwaara taiyaar kii jaati he
 The cell that is used for electrolytic analysis is a large box made of steel, with a carbon lining inside
 carbon kaa yah astr coke, pich or tarkol ke mishran ko tapaakar taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, carbon dioxide is also prepared
 ye bahudhaa 12-20 inch lambey ytaakar hote hai
 These dhanagras are hanging from a conductor latch and can be lowered at will
 vidyut cell ke bheetar galaa hua cryolite lete hai or vidyuddhara is prakaar niyantrit karte rahete hai ki uske pravaah kii garmi se hi cryolite baraabar galit avasthaa main bana rahe
 When the electrolyte is formed, the aluminum metal formed is heavier than the cryolite, hence settling down in the cell
 yah dhaatu hi runagra kaa kaam karti he
 The corroded metal is periodically flushed out of the cell
 cell main bich-bich main aavashyaktaanusaar or alumina milaate jate hai
 To reduce the melting point of cryolite, it is often added with a little calcium fluoride
 yah ullekhneey he ki aluminium dhaatu ke kaarkaane kii safalataa sasti bijli ke upar nirbhar he

 Sulfur, selenium, and tellurium are combined with this metal only when heated
 hydrochloric amla garam hone par dhaatu ke saath abhikriya karke chloride banaata he
 This action is dependent on the purity of the metal and the concentration of acid
 tanu salfurik amla kaa dhaatu par dhire-dhire hi prabhaav padataa he, par amla kii sandratha badhaane par yah prabhaav pehle to badhata he, par phir kam hone lagata he
 98% sulfuric acid has little effect on the metal
 nitric amla kaa prabhaav is dhaatu par itnaa kam hota he ki sandra nitric amla aluminium ke bane paatro main band karke dur-dur tak bheja ja saktaa he
 Ammonia solution does not affect the metal at low temperature, but the reaction takes place intensely when heated
 castic soda, castic potash or barita kaa aluminium dhaatu par prabhaav tivrata se hota he, parantu calcium hydraksaide kaa adhik nahin hota
 Aluminum is more reactive to oxygen
 is gun ke kaaran anek oxidon ke apchayan main is dhaatu kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Iron, manganese, chromium, malibedinum, tungsten etc
 metals are separated from their oxides using aluminum powder in Goldsmit's thermite or heating method

 In many languages it is also known as Röntgen radiation, which is based on the name of its investigator Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen
 rontjan equalent maanav isaki shastreey maapak ikai he
 In 1895 X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Konrad Runtzen, a professor of physics at the University of Wurtzburg in Germany
 yadi kaanch kii nalika main se vaayu ko pump se kramash: nikaala jaae or usamen ucch vibhav kaa vidyudvisarjan kiya jaae, to daab ke paryaapt alp hone par vaayu swayan prakashit hone lagati he
 While conducting an experimental study of this phenomenon, Rantzen observed that when the air pressure was very low, the rays coming out of the sluice tube gave light to barium platinocyanide and, when the tube was completely covered with black paper Also, the manibh kept nearby keeps on shouting
 at: yah spasht tha ki visarjananalika ke baahar jo kirane aati hai ve kaale kaagaj main se sugamawa se paar ho sakati hai or barium platinosynide ke parade ko dhyutimaan karne kaa vishesh gun in kirnon main he
 Such rays were not yet known in science
 at: in nai avishkrut kirnon kaa naam 'eksrez' rakhaa gaya, kintu rantjan ke sammaan main, visheshat : germany main, in kirnon ko 'rantjan kirane' hi kaha jaataa he
 As soon as Rantzen's invention was published, the attention of the entire scientific world was attracted to X-ray
 apaardarshee thos padaartho main se paar hone kaa eksre kaa gundharm atyant mahatvapurn tha or is gundharm kaa upyog vigyaan ke anek vibhaagon main ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, efforts were made to produce X-rays and study their properties in many physics laboratories
 alp daab par vaayu main jo vidyut visarjan hota he, uske adhyayan kaa aadhunik bhautikee ke vikaas main ek vishesh sthaan he
 If by connecting a long glass tube with a vacuum pump, the inner air flows through a high voltage current, initially, when the pressure is high, no action is seen, but when the air pressure is reduced first Both are electronegative
 daab ko or kam karne par sampurna nalika dhyutimaan ho jaati he
 According to the interpretation of modern physics, the reason is that when electrons get energy and they move with the remaining air molecules while moving at high velocity towards the positive
 sanghaton ke kaaran anuon ke aayan banate hai or jab ye aayan purv avasthaa ko praapt hote hai tab prakaash kaa utsarjan hota he
 Due to the existence of ions, electrophoresis continues in the air
 daab ke atyant alp ho jane par electranon se sanghaat hone ke liye paryaapt anu nahin rahete; at: electron runagra se nikalakar apni sampurna urja se dhanagar se sidhe takaraate hai
 Due to these effects, the intense energy of electrons gets to the atoms of the cation and one result is the production of X-rays
 is paddati se eksre kaa utpaadan karne ke liye nalika main ek kranthik daab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If the air pressure is higher than this critical pressure, then there is not enough energy in the electrons to produce the x-ray
 duusari ore, yadi daab is kranthik daab se kam ho to electron utpann hi nahin hote, at: vidyudvisarjan hi band ho jaataa he
 Initially the X-ray was produced using a similar type of aerial and the air pressure was kept at a critical value of this critical pressure
 eksre ke do vishesh gundharm adhik mahatvapurn hai : There are three main methods of intensity measurement
 pratideept parade par eksre se jo dipti aati he uski tivrata-maryaadit dipti tak-eksre kii tivrata kii samaanupati hoti he
 The intensity of the x-ray can be broadly compared by estimating the intensity of fluorescence
 duusari vidhi main photo pattica ke upar eksre kii jo kriya hoti he, uskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The blackness that comes from the X-ray incident on the photo plate depends on the intensity of the X-ray and the time of incidence
 is paddati se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii tulana karne ke liye adhik tivrata ke eksre punj se photo pattica par maryaadit sthaan par kisi upyukt kaal tak kriya hone di jaati he or tatpashchaat usee pattica par kuch neeche duusare eksre punj kii kriya kaal t, 2t, 3t aadi tak hone di jaati he
 After developing the plaque, comparing the blackness of the two pictures gives a sense of the relative intensity of the two arms
 tivrathamapan kii teesri reeti adhik prachlit he, kyonki is reeti se tivrata thik thik maapi ja sakati he
 When the x-ray passes through the air, the air becomes electronegative and its conductivity depends on the intensity of the x-ray
 eksre kii kriya se vaayu ke anuon ke electron visthapit hote hai or aayan utpann hote hai
 In the presence of proper electrodepolarization, the electrons that can be obtained from ions can be measured with a sensory electronometer, or with other appropriate sensory devices
 eksre kii tivrata vidyuddhara kii samaanupati hoti he
 More recently, the use of multiplier-illuminant and x-ray sensing spurs has made intensity measurements extremely accessible
 usee prakaar, gaigagunak kii sahaayta se ynikaran kii dhara kaa maapan bhi sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 Therefore, measurement of intensity of X-rays by both these types of devices is more prevalent in present day
 tivrathamapan kii in teenon prachlit ritiyon se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii keval tulana hi ho sakati he, nirpeksh tivrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 In fact, we can call the intensity of the X-ray as the energy exerted per second on an area of one square centimeter perpendicular to the x-ray
 is tivrata ko arg prati varg centimetre prati senkad main vyakt karte hai
 In order to measure intensity as energy, the energy of the X-ray is very low because in this way intensely specific instruments are required for intensification
 is reeti se tivrathamapan kaa pratham prayaas terril ne kiya tha
 Subsequently, in 1953, Henderson, BT and Laffan of the University of Illinois in the United States also tried
 ati prachand vidyudvibhav se utpann eksre kii tivrata keval isi reeti se naapi ja sakati he
 Experimental work of physics always requires units and has its shape according to the measured amount
 eksre kii maatra ke ekak ko 'rantjan' kehete hai or vartmaan kaal main ek rantjan kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit prakaar se kii jaati he- Another special feature of X-rays is their solubility
 bhinn bhinn thos pindon kii samaan motaayiyon main se paar hone par eksre kii tivrata main jo kami hoti he vah samaan nahin hoti
 The absorption of X-rays is higher in some solids and less in some substances
 prayog dwaara yah fal praapt hua ki kisi thos vishesh kii bhinn bhinn motaayiyon main se yadi eksre paar jaae, to nirgat eksre ko tivrata, praarambhik tivrata or thos padaarth kii motaai, in teenon main nimnlikhit sameekaran ke anusaar sambandh rahata he : log = - m × thickness --- yahan = eksre kii praarambhik tivrata; i = intensity of x-ray after crossing through solid material; m = ek sthiraank, jisko 'avasorana gunak' kehete hai
 This constant is called that solid's special x-ray-absorption-multiplier
 vastut: yah rekhiy gunak he
 To express it broadly, it is divided into the density of that solid substance and thus the absorption coefficient obtained is called 'code-absorption-factor'
 at: mmass = m / density sanhati-avasorana-gunak kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki vah avasorak padaarth kaa lakshanik gundharm he
 For example, the linear absorption-multiplier of water and steam is different, because water is liquid and steam is gas
 parantu jal tathaa bhaap kaa eksre sanhati-avasorana-gunank samaan hi hota he, kyonki jal tathaa bhaap ke rasinic sanrachak abhinn hai arthath hydrogen tathaa oxijan
 The variation of the properties of light and x-rays is very clear from the code-absorption-multiplier
 saadhaarant: drav or thos padaarth prakaash ke liye swayan apaardarshee athwa parbhasak hote hai
 Diamond is transparent and graphite opaque to light, but the codon-absorption-coefficient of X-ray remains the same for diamond and graphite, as these two materials are essentially different forms of carbon
 eksre nalika se jo sampurna eksre praapt hote hai, un sabakaa avasorana-gunak mukhyat: vidyudvibhav or avasorak parade kii dhaatu kaa parmaanu-kramank, in donon par nirbhar rahata he
 As the voltage increases, the penetration or hardness of the x-ray produced increases
 sameekaran se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kisi ek thos padaarth ke liye avasorana gunak sab motaayiyon ke liye sthir rahegaa
 But in direct use, the low passable portion of radiation received from the x-ray tube is completely absorbed in the first levels of the absorber screen
 keval adhik praveshkshmata ke eksre avasorana parade ke antim staron tak pahunch pate hai
 It is clear that the absorption factor of the x-ray entering the absorption screen is higher than the absorption factor of the x-ray crossing the absorption screen
 jab samast eksre kaa avasorana gunak samaan hota he tab unako samang eksre kehete hai
 Thus the amount of X-rays is measured by their intensity and their characteristic by their absorption-multiplier
 jis padaarth se prakaash aata he us padaarth ko ham dekh sakate hai, kyonki prakaash kirnon kii ek kriya hamaari aankh ke roopaadhar par hoti he
 This type of action is not by X-ray, so X-rays are not visible
 itnaa hi nahin, aankhon par tathaa sharir ke anya angon par eksre kii kriya atyant hanikaarak hoti he
 Due to the action of X-rays on living cells for a sufficient period of time, they are reduced
 eksre sharir ke charm main se saralata se paar ho jate hai or bheetar ke jivit koshaaon par inaki paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se unke mrit ho jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Again, X-ray effects are durable; Therefore, X-ray activity continues at different places at the same place of the body, and in some periods, cancer-like refractory diseases occur
 at: eksre kaa upyog karte samay atyant saavdhaanee se kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Special tools are used to protect the body
 iske atirikt eksre kaa nity upyog karanevaale vartmaan kaal main ek eksre-maatra-maapi apni jeb main rakhte hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki vikiran kii kitni maatra karmchaaree ke upar kaary kar chuki he
 This lethal property of X-rays is also used in other diseases; For example, if harmful pathogens grow in any part of the body, they can be destroyed by using X-rays on them
 eksre kaa ayurvigyaan main, visheshat: shalyakarm main, adhik upyog hota he
 The possibility of this type of use was evident from the time of X-ray's invention
 sharir ke bhinn-bhinn avyavon ke avasorana-gunak vibhinn hote hai; at: sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag main se eksre paar karke photo lene se asthiyaan tathaa anya ghatak pruthak pruthak dikhaai dete hai 
 Therefore, X-ray photographs are very useful before surgery, or to find out what condition the disease is in
 eksre ke utpaadan main pragati hone par unka upyog udyogon main bhi hone laga or vartmaan kaal main dhaatuvigyaan main eksre kaa upyog aavashyak ho gaya he
 Energy is either combined with particles or combined with waves
 kisi udgam se urja kaa visarjan hota ho to is urja kaa astitv saadhaarant: vidyucchambukiy tarangon kii tivrata main, athwa electron, proton, neutron, aayan ityadi kanon kii gatij urja ke rup main, vyakt hota he
 The patterns of wave and particle are different; Therefore, they are usually kept in different categories
 kintu anek prayogon ke falon se yah spasht ho gaya he ki in virgon kaa bandhan tarangon main kanon ke gun hai or, vilomat: kanon main bhi tarangon ke gun hai
 This duality form began with the principle of the heat of the Planck
 eksre ke gun bhi is dwait rup ke apwaad nahin hai
 X-rays have certain properties of waves and certain properties are also of particles
 pehle ham tarangeey gunon par vichaar karenge
 From the fruits of early experiments, it was clear that X-rays and light have properties comparable
 eksre tathaa prakaash kii kirnon kaa dik main saral rekhaon main prachaaran hota he
 Like light, the intensity of an x-ray is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance
 photo pattica par honevaali kriya tathaa gas main kiye gaye ynikaran ke gunon main bhi donon main samya he
 In 1905 AD, by experiment, Marx proved that the velocity of the x-ray is the same as the velocity of light — that is, 3 × 10 ° cm per second
 vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey kshetron main eksre aprabhavit rahete hai
 It was clear from all these properties that X-rays are electromagnetic in nature, not light charged particles
 bhed keval tarangadairghyo main ho saktaa he
 From the experiments of scientists such as Haga, Windt, Walters, Pol, Sommerfeld, etc
, it could be inferred that the wavelength of the x-ray was 1 × 10–8 cm
 Is near kintu pratham nirnayaatmak fal lave, freederish tathaa kniping ke prayogon se praapt hua or eksre kii tarangadairghy pramanit hui
 After this experiment, several attempts were made to clarify the wavelength of the X-ray and to obtain experimental results of other results in relation to it and to obtain experimental results of other dimensions with respect to it
 eksre kaa tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghy se bahut kam hone ke kaaran jin prayogon dwaara prakaash kaa tarangadairghy saralata se mapa ja saktaa he, vaise prayog eksre ke liye karne main anek kathinaaiyaan upasthit hoti hai
 However, in the present times, experiments like X-ray interference, diffraction, polarization, etc
 have been successful, and the wavelengths of the X-rays have been known to be as high as the optical waves
 jin prayogon se eksre kii tarangaprakruti pramanit hoti he unamem se kuch neeche die ja rahe hai- X-rays are particularly helpful in finding the crystalline structure
 chikitsiya upyogon ke alaava bhi eksre kaa anekon prakaar se upyog kiya jaataa he
 Due to the unique properties of X-rays, they are widely used in many branches of science and in various industries
 udyogon main, visheshat: nirmaan tathaa nirmit padaartho ke gunon ke niyantran main, eksre kaa bahut upyog hota he
 Intrinsic errors of manufactured materials can be easily detected by X-ray photographs
 vimaan tathaa usee prakaar ke sadhano ke yantron main ati teevr veg tathaa charam bhautik paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa hai; aise yantron ke nirmaan main prayek avyav antarbahya nirdosh tathaa yatharth hona chahie
 Each such component is tested with an X-ray and the defective components are discarded
 dhaatu eksre kaa avasorana karte hai, at: dhaatuon ke antarbhaagon kii pariksha ke liye mridu eksre anupyukt hote hai
 Extremely high-voltage X-rays are required for large-sized metallic materials
 dhaatu vigyaan tathaa dhatugaveshna main eksre atyant upyogi hai
 Metals are also crystalline, but their crystals are fine and they are set up in the desired way, so the lave-statue of metals usually has a concentric circle
 prayek vartual ek samaan tivrata kaa hota he, kintu kisi bhautik kriya se kanon ke aakaaron main vruddhi ho jane par in vartualon main bindu bhi aate hai
 Therefore, by X-ray interference, it is known exactly what the particles of metallic particles are and how their shape is like
 is gyaan kaa dhaatuvigyaan main atyant mahatv he
 At the time of making metal materials, heat causes them to become insoluble
 dhaatu ko modane se bhi usamen antarvikruti ho jaati he
 Such distortions can be analyzed by X-ray
 is prakaar vishisht gunon se yukt nirdosh dhaatu praapt karne main eksre kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 Among other uses of X-rays, the X-ray microscope is notable
 eksre ke tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghyo se sookshm hote hai, at: eksre sookshmdarshi ko prakaash sookshmdarshi se adhik prabhaavshaalee hona chahie
 In 1948, Kirkpatrick's efforts to focus X-rays were partially successful
 is reeti se tathaa anya ritiyon se pratibimb kaa aavardhan karne ke praytn ab praayogic avasthaa paar kar chuke hai or anek nirmaataaon dwaara nirmit kai prakaar ke eksre sookshmdarshi sulabh hai
 Things that cannot be detected with light microscope are easily understood by X-ray microscope

 Xuanzang in India: An Indian saint was named Mahavatar Babaji by Lahiri Mahashi and many of his disciples who met Mahavatar Babaji between 1861 and 1935
 in bhenton main se kuch kaa varnan paramhans yoganand ne apni pustak ek yogi kii aatmakatha main kiya he isamen yoganand kii mahavatar babaaji ke saath swany kii bhet kaa pratyaksh varnan bhi shaamil he
 Another direct description was given by Sri Yukteswar Giri in his book The Holy Science
 ye sab varnan or babaaji mahavatar ke saath hui anya bhenten yogaanand dwaara ullikhit vibhinn aatmakathaaon main varnit hai
 The real name and date of birth of Mahavatar Babaji are not known, so those visiting him during that period were first called by him as the title given by Lahiri Mahashi
 "mahavatar" kaa arth he "mahaan avatar" or "babaaji" kaa saral sa matlab he "shraddhey pita"
 kuch mulaakaaten jinke do yaa adhik sakshi bhi the-mahavatar babaaji se mulaakaat karne vaale un sabhi vyaktiyon ke bich charchaaon se sanket miltaa he ki ve sabhi ek hi vyakti se mili the
 The first recorded meeting with Samhavatar Babaji was in 1861, when Lahiri Mahashi was posted to Ranikhet on a job as an accountant of the British government
 ek din ranikhet se upar dunagiri kii pahadiyon main ghoomte samay usne kisi ko apana naam pukaarte suna
 awaz ke peeche-peeche upar pahaad par chalate hue uski mulaakaat "ek oonche kad ke tejasvi sadhu" se hui
 He was astonished to find that the monk knew his name
 yah sadhu mahavatar babaaji the
 Mahavatar Babaji told Mahasya Lahiri that he was his guru in the past, then initiated him into Kriya Yoga and instructed Lahiri to start initiating others
 lahiri mahavatar babaaji ke saath rahanaa chaahate the lekin unhone unhen duniya main waapas jaakar kriya yoga sikhaane ko kaha or ki "kriya yoga sadhana duniya main unki kii upasthiti ke madhyam se logon main failegi
" Lahiri Mahasaya reported that Mahavatar Babaji did not reveal his name or background so Lahiri gave him the title of "mahavatar Babaji"
 bharat main kai saadhuon ko babaaji kaha jaataa he or kabhi kabhi "babaaji maharaj" bhi jisase mahavatar babaaji or anya samaan naam ke saadhuon ke bich bhram hota he
 Lahiri Mahasaya has had several meetings with Mahavatar Babaji, written about in several books, among others, including the autobiography of a yogi of Paramahamsa Yogananda, Yogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya and Purna Purush: Yogiraj Shri Sham Charan Lahiri
 lahiri mahashay ke anek shishyon ne bhi yah kaha ki unhone babaaji se mulaakaat kii
 Through discussion with each other and the fact that some of these offerings were two or more witnesses, they confirmed that the person they saw was the same monk whom Lahiri called Mahavatar Babaji
 1894 main, elahabaad main kumbh meley par shri yukteshwar giri lahiri mahashay ke ek shishy mahavatar babaaji se mili
 He was surprised by the resemblance between Lahiri Mahasaya and Mahavatar Babaji
 duusare jo babaaji se mili unhone bhi samanta par tippanee kii
 In such meetings, Mahavatar Babaji instructed Mr
 Yukteswar to write the book Kaivalya Darshanam or The Holy Science
 Mr
 Yukteswar had two more meetings with Mahavatar Babaji, one in which Lahiri Mahashi was also present
 lahiri mahashay ke ek or shishy, swami pranbanand giri ne bhi lahiri ke ghar par lahiri mahashay kii upasthiti main mahavatar babaaji se mulaakaat kii
 Pranbananda asked Mahavatar Babaji his age
 Mahavatar Babaji replied that he was about 500 years of age at that time
 lahiri mahashay ke ek shishy swami keshabnand giri 1935 ke aasapaas badrinaathke nikat pahaado ke paas mahavatar babaaji se bhent kii baat kehete hai, jab vah pahaado main bhatak gayi the
 Pranbananda told that during Bhet Babaji gave him a message for Yogananda that "he is eagerly expecting, i will not meet him this time but i will meet him on some other occasion
" lahiri mahashay ke anya shishy jo mahavatar babaaji se milane kii baat karte hai unamem shaamil hai swami cabelnand giri or ram gopal mazumdaar jo mahavatar babaaji or unki bahan jise usne mataji kahkar pukaara, se bhent kaa varnan karte hai
 Also, Shankari Mata Lahiri, a female disciple of Trelanga Swami, met Mahavatar Babaji while visiting Mahasaya
 lahiri mahashay ke shishyon dwaara mahavatar babaaji kii puranic shaktiyon or umr kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 These stories have led many to believe that Mahavatar Babaji is a great man instead of an actual monk who has been seen by many witnesses during 1861 to 1935
 paramhans yoganand ji ne apni aatmakatha main prithvi par mahavatar babaaji bhoomika kaa varnan kiya he: The great waves are in constant dialogue with Christ, both of them waves of redemption bhejte hai or is yug ke liye uddhaar kii aadhyatmik takanic kii yojana banaai he
 The work of these two fully illuminated owners — one body and one body — is to inspire countries to renounce evils stemming from suicidal war, ethnic hatred, religious communalism, and materialism
 babaaji aadhunik samay kii pravriti, vishesh rup se pashchimi sabhyataa ke prabhaav or jatiltaaon se acchhee tarah parichit hai or pashchim or purv main samaan rup se yoga kii aatm - mukti ko failaane kii aavashyaktaa ko anubhav karte hai
 In addition, Babaji is reputed to have been a Viva according to some accounts, and according to Pranabananda Swami, around 1800 italic texts are around 500 years old
 yoganand kehete hai ki lahiri mahashay ke chelon ke anusaar babaaji kii umr, parivaar, janm sthaan, asli naam yaa "itihaaskaar ko priy" anya vivarankoi nahin jaanata he
 According to Yogananda's autobiography, he has a sister named Mataji who has been alive for centuries
 uskaa aadhyatmik prapti kaa str apane bhai ke baraabar he or vah ek bhumigat gupha main aadhyatmik paramanand kii sthiti main rahati he
 Although only three pages in the book are devoted to her, she is described by Ram Gopal as "a young and infinitely beautiful" and a "magnificent woman"
 lahiri mahashay ne apni diary main likhaa ki mahavatar babaaji bhagwaan krishna the
 Two disciples of Paramahansa Yogananda wrote that they too said that Mahavatar Babaji was Krishna in his former life
 yogaanand bhi aksar jor se "babaaji-krishna" kahkar prarthana kiya karte the

 For a long time, the 14th century poet Chaucer was considered the father of English poetry
 angreji kavita kii kendriya parampara kii drushti se yah dharna sarvatha nirmul bhi nahin he
 But on the basis of hereditary, now all the poetry before Chaucer is being studied under the ancient times
 narman vijay ne england kii pracheen anglo-sackson samskruti par gaharaa prabhaav daalaa or use nai disha di
 Therefore, two distinct divisions of ancient times can also be made, from the emergence to the Norman conquest and from the Norman conquest to the rise of Chaucer, in terms of language, we can also call them anglo-saxon or ancient English period and early medieval English period respectively
 pracheen angreji kavita lagbhag 500 varshon tak pracheen angreji main kavitaayen likhi jaati raheen lekin aaj unka adhikansh keval chaar hastlikhit pratiyon main praapt he
 Knowledge of all the poetry of that period is limited to two or four more compositions

 He also brought with him an oral tradition of poetry born between adventurous life and wars
 chhathi shatabdi ke antim varshon main unhone vyapak paimaane par itihaas kii diksha lee
 Thus ancient English poetry is culturally a confluence of barbaric civilization and Christianity

 Due to the tendency to preach, ancient English poetry has lyrical lyrics limited to dramatic songs like Demente Lament and mourning songs such as 'the Wanderer', 'the Seafarer', 'the Guin', 'the Wife's Complaint'
 ek chota-sa ansh paheliyon or hasyapurna cathopakathanon kaa bhi he
 Ancient English poems are written in highly ornate and unnatural language
 shabdakrida in kaviyon kaa swabhaav he or ek-ek shabd ke kai paryaay dene main unhen bada anand aata he
 The basic principle of Padmrachna in ancient English poetry is alliteration
 yah vyanjan mukhar bhashaa he or vyanjanon ke anupras par hi panktiyon kii rachana hoti he
 Each line has two parts, the first of which consists of two, and the second one of the nearest characters, in accented alliteration
 in kavitaaon main tukon kaa sarvatha abhaav he
 The Norman conquest was also the cultural victory of France over England
 iske baad lagbhag 200 varshon tak french bhashaa abhijaton kii bhashaa bani rahi
 The tradition of old epigraphic poetry almost came to an end

 france ke rollan or england ke arthur kii gaathaon tathaa kelti dantakthaon ke atirikt laathini premgaathaon ne bhi is kaal kii kavita ko samrudh kiya
 Thus in the 13th century some excellent specimens of Gitipradhan poems, both temporal and religious, were presented
 europea sangeet, french chand or padrachana tathaa vaitalikon or chaarnon kii udaatt kalpana ne milakar is yug kii kavita ko sanvaara
 Some of the famous 12th and 13th century compositions include 'the Owl and the Nightingale', 'aryamulam', 'cursor Mandai', 'havelack the Dane', 'arthur and Merlin', 'grik of Conions', 'dame Sirith', Brut Etc

 He liberated English poetry from solitude and narrow-mindedness
 madhyayugin europe kii saamanti samskruti ke do pramukh romani tatwon, dakshinya or maadhurya kaa adarsh french, german or spani bhashaaon main prastut ho chukaa tha
 In England, Chaucer and his contemporary poet Gower distinguished that ideal in English poetry with equal success
 madhyadeshiy angreji ko french kavita ke udaatt bhav or uski abhivyakti kii swatchta, sugharta or sarasata dene ke kaaran praayah chosar ko angreji main likhane vaala 'french kavi' kaha jaataa he
 There is no doubt that Chaucer learned a lot from the famous love story The Romance of the Rose and its predecessors or contemporary French poets, Masho, Dasha, Fwasar and Granges
 di book ov dachence, di parliament ov foules, di house ov fam aadi uski praarambhik rachanaaon or di lijend ov good vimen ko prastaavna me yah prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 These include the symbol scheme or metaphor, dream, ideal love, honey morning, twitter bird, etc
, many features of French poetry
 chosar kii chand rachana par bhi uskaa vyapak prabhaav he
 After Chaucer's first visit to Italy in 1372 AD, another new element appears in his poem
 dante, petrark or bokkacho ne use na keval nae vishay die balki nai drushti bhi di
 The last of these poets influenced him the most
 bokkacho se anek kathaayen lene ke atirikt chosar ne varnan kii nipunata, aakarshak chitra yojana or aaveg-purna abhivyakti kii kala sikhi
 This new influence is evident in his famous work Frailus and Cressed
 lekin chosar kii pratibha keval rinon par jivit rahane vaali nahin thi; usne anek pracheen kathaon ko yatharth or naatakeey charitra-chithran, vinod or vyangy or utsaahpurn varnan se atyant sajiv kar diya
 Her talent was revealed with all her might in Chaucer's final and magnum opus The Canterbury Tales
 yah rachana uske samaaj kaa chitra he or apane yatharthwaad ke kaaran isane france or italy kii tatkaaleen kavita ko bahut peeche chhod diya
 In this work, Chaucer poured out all his knowledge and study of human life
 isamen yatharth charitra-chithran or charitron ke parsparik saghanrsh dwaara chosar ne naatak or upanyaas ke bhavi vikaas ko bhi prabhavit kiya
 The tradition of liberal satire and squid also began with this work
 chosar main chhadon ke prayog kii adbhut kshamta thi
 The seven-line Faye Rhym Raeloff used in the Fayalus and Cresidf and the Dasavarni rhyme bipedi used in the f Canterbury Talesf were widely used in further English poetry
 chosar ke samasamayikon main gower kaa sthaan bhi unchaa he
 Her creation is a deepening of morality on the love stories of Confessio Amantis
 isliye use fa sadaachari goweraf bhi kaha gaya
 It lacks the realism and humor of Chaucer
 vah pratibha se adhik svachh shilp kaa kavi he
 William Langland is a poet of the 14th century's most famous work, Fierce Plowmanf
 usne angreji kii sanuprasic style kaa vyavhaar kiya
 But his poetry is a challenge against the social and religious hypocrisies of that era
 usamen jivan ke liye dharm or uski rahasyabhaavna ke mahatv kii sthapana he
 The entire composition is metaphoric and has many levels of meaning
 lekin langland ne katha ke anshon ko safalataa ke saath ekanvit kiya he
 In Langland not the melody of Chaucer and Gower, he is a poet of outrage and ooze
 isi yug main kuch or bhi sanuprasic rachanaayen hui jinamein sar guin and di green nite or parl vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 It is based on Aathar's saga and The Romance of the Rose respectively
 pehali main charitra-chithran kii sookshm drushti or prakruti ke asaadhaaran roopon or sthitiyon ke prati moh vyakt hota he or duusari rachana avsaadpurn komal bhaawanaaon or rahasyanubhuti se ot prot he
 The time between Chaucer's death and the Renaissance means that the whole 15th century is unchanged from the point of view of poetry
 chosar ke anek or langland ke kuch anuyaayi england or scotland main hue
 But the poetry of most of them is lifeless
 aklive, lidgat, hoj, barkele or scalton jaise angrej anuyaayiyon se kahin adhik shaktishaalee scotland ke anuyaayi rabart henrison, wiliam danbar or james pratham the, kyonki unhone apni boli, apni bhoomi ke prakritik saundarya or anubhutiyon kii sachai kaa adhik dhyaan rakhaa
 In important compositions of this century, songs and ballads related to religion, love and might can be mentioned
 vyangy or vinodpurn kavitaayen bhi likhi gayi
 Despite the remains of medieval culture, the 16th century is the culmination of Renaissance humanism in England
 yah maanavtawaad saamanti vyavastha ke dharm, samaaj, naitikta or darshan ke viruddh vyapaaree poonjipatiyon ke nae varg kii vichaardhaara thi
 The inspiration of this class led to the religion-reform-movement, revolutionary research in astrology and science, adventurous sea voyages in search of wealth and new countries
 maanavtawaad ne vyakti ke gyaan or karm kii amit sambhaavnaaon ke saath-saath sahitya main prayogon or kalpana kii mukti kii ghoshnaa kii
