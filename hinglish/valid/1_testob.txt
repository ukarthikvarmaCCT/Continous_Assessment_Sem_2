 kishorilaal america main rahane vaale ek dhani vyapaaree hai jo bharat main apane puraane dost suraj dev se miltaa he
 During his stay in a conservative traditional Indian family, he came to know Suraj's eldest daughter Ganga, who is well-versed in Indian culture
 kishorilaal suraj se apane pashchimi samskruti main rache based bete rajeev ke liye ganga kaa haath maangata he
 She is confident that Ganga will not only be a perfect bride, but she will be able to revive Indian values in Rajiv
 kishorilaal apane paale hue bete arjuna se apni yojana ko aage badhaane main madad karne ke liye kahata he
 Arjun's thinking is similar to Kishori Lal and Ganga
 arjuna rajeev se pehle ganga se milane ke liye jaataa he or usase milakar mohit ho jaataa he
 Arjun, despite his attraction to Ganga, tries to unite Rajiv and Ganga as per Kishori Lal's wishes
 arjuna rajeev ke charitra or aadaton ke bare main ganga ko dhokhaa detaa he
 Both Rajiv and Ganga agree to marry each other through Arjuna's efforts
 sagaai bharat main hoti he, lekin parivaar is baat se sahamat hota he ki ganga ko apane shaadi se pehle america janaa chahie
 Ganga feels alone after a few weeks
 uskaa ekmaatr sachcha dost arjuna he jiske saath vah ek vishesh bandhan bananaa shuru kar detii he
 Gradually, Ganga realizes that Rajiv is not the person Arjuna portrayed him in India
 arjuna ko pataa chalata he ki vah ganga se pyaar main pad gaya he
 But because of his loyalty to Kishori Lal, he encourages her to continue the engagement and later worries about changing Rajiv
 rajeev kii shatrutapurna chachee nita ne ganga or arjuna ke bich badhati dosti kii ore dhyaan diya or kishorilaal ko chetavanee di
 He arranges to transfer Arjuna
 phir kishorilaal las vegas main ganga ke saath rahane ke liye rajeev ke liye ek choti si chuttee kii yojana banaata he
 In Las Vegas, Rajiv gets drunk and his contempt for his fellow Indians is revealed
 bahes main ganga ne rajeev ko thappad maar diya
 Furious, he tries to rape Ganga; After a violent struggle, she knocks him unconscious and runs away
 rajeev kishorilaal ko suchit karata he jo jald gaayab ganga kii talash shuru karte hai
 Arjun finds Ganga crying at the train station
 vah use kishorilaal ke ghar waapas jane ke liye raji karne kii koshish karata he, lekin usne manaa kar diya
 Arjun promises to help her return safely to her family in India
 arjuna or ganga ke surakshit rup se bharat pahunchane ke baad, kishorilaal suraj ko suchit karata he ki arjuna ganga se saath bhaag gaya he
 Then Arjun departs, intending never to return
 ganga ke chote bhai bahan or daadi chupake se usko arjuna ke saath bhaagane kii salaah dete hai
 Now Ganga realizes that she is in love with Arjun and secretly leaves the house with his help
 is samay tak, kishorilaal rajeev ke saath bharat aate hai
 Ganga catches Arjun in a temple and demands that he express his love but Arjun is still loyal to Kishori Lal and refuses to marry her
 arjuna ko maarane ke liye rajeev kai thagon ke saath aata he
 In the ensuing battle, Arjun is badly beaten but eventually kills everyone
 jaise hi arjuna rajeev ko maarane vaala hota he, kishorilaal suraj ke saath aata he
 Arjun tells Kishori Lal that he really loves Ganga, accepting it
 vah pushti karata he ki usne kabhi uskaa peechha nahin kiya or sammanpurvak vyaavhaar kiya, jabaki rajeev ne har tarah se sammanjanak karrwai ko khaarij kar diya or is bare main jhooth bolaa ki ganga kyon bharat laut ai
 Not only is the Ganges unable to merge with Western culture but Western value almost completely ruined the Ganges
 ganga rajeev ke balaatkaar kii koshish kii pushti karti he, jo har kisi ko jhatka detaa he
 Realizing that she has actually heard the truth, Kishorelal confirms that Ganga will marry her son

 ek inaam ke rup main mahmud ne apni bahan kaa salaar sahu se vivaah kiya
 Masood was the child of this marriage
 masood kaa janm ajmer main 10 farvari san 1014 main hua tha
 Inspired by military and religious fervor, Masood asked the Ghaznavi emperor to come to India and spread Islam
 16 saal kii umr main, usne sindhu nadi paar karte hue bharat par hamalaa kiya
 He conquered Multan and in the 18th month of his campaign, he reached Delhi
 gazani se bal vruddhi ke baad usne dilli par vijay praapt kii or 6 maheene tak vahaan rahaa
 He then conquered Meerut after some resistance

 Masud established his headquarters at Satrikh and dispatched separate forces to capture Bahraich, Hardoi and Benares

 His father Salar Sahu then reached Bahraich and defeated the enemies
 uske pita salaar sahu kaa 4 aktubar 1032 ko satrikh main nidhan ho gaya
 Masood continued his campaigns
 baharich ke hindu pramukh puri tarah se adheen nahin hue the, isliye masood swayan san 1033 main baharich pahunchaa
 Until the arrival of a ruler named Suheldev, Masood went on to defeat his Hindu enemies in Bahraich
 vah 15 june 1034 ko suheldev ke khilaaf ladaai main parajeet or ghaatak rup se ghayal ho gaya
 While dying, he asked his followers to bury him on the banks of the sacred reservoir
 kyonki vah yuddh main maaraa gaya tha, use gaji ke rup main janaa jane laga
 By the 2000s, most visitors to the annual fair held at Masood's Dargah were Hindus

 The doctrines propounded by Galileo contradicted religious beliefs, for which Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment for trespassing with divine beliefs

 The scientific study of the results of the interrelations of the sounds of the string, or the string, stretched for the music by the father, was done by his son Galileo

 'this great mathematician and scientist only dared to measure the speed of light

 From where Galileo lit the lantern, after getting his assistant's signal, they were to indicate the light through the lantern and its knock
 duusari pahari par sthit unke sahaayak ko laalaten kaa prakaash dekhakar apane paas rakhi duusari laalaten kaa khatka hataakar punah sanket karnaa tha
 Thus Galileo had to estimate the speed of light by looking at the light shining on the top of the second mountain

 In due course, Albert Einstein, the great scientist who solved the intricate relationship between the speed of light and the relationship of energy, referred to him as 'father of modern science'

 In the year 1609, Galileo discovered a telescope that was invented in Holland, with the help of this telescope, one could study their motion by looking at distant celestial bodies
 galileo ne iskaa vivaran sunakar swayan aisi doorabeen kaa nirmaan kar daalaa jo holland main avishkrut doorabeen se kahin adhik shaktishaalee thi
 Based on this, through his observations and experiments, Galileo found that all the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun, contrary to the prevailing beliefs in the universe
 isse purv copernicus ne bhi yah kaha tha ki prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he jiske liye unhe carch kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa tha
 Now, based on the results based on experimentation and discretion, Galilea found it to be the same
 us samay tak yah sarvamaanya sidwant tha ki brahmand ke kendra main prithvi sthit he tathaa surya or chandramaa sahit sabhi akashiya pind lagaataar prithvi kii parikrama karte he
 This recognition was supported by the religious leaders of Tadsamay
 apane prayogon ke aadhaar par praapt parinaamon ke kaaran galileo ne puraani avadharanaon ke virudv khadey hone kaa nirnay liya
 When Galileo made this doctrine public, the Church considered it his disobedience and for this disobedience Galileo was sentenced to imprisonment on behalf of the Church
 galileo ke dwaara diye gayi vichaar ne tadsamay manushya ke chintan kii disha ke naye rup main swikaarne ko vivash kar diya

 Thus, it took more than three and a half years for the Church to accept its historical error by ordering a 1633 order regarding Galileo, a great astronomer, mathematician, physicist and philosopher

 safalataa or avsaan 
 From 1579 to 1585 revolts were started in the Mughal occupied territories of the former Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Bihar and Gujarat and Maharana was also winning strongholds one after the other, so as a result Akbar was averse to suppress that rebellion and from the Mewar Mughals

 kyonki ucch amylos cornstarch main baari maatra main pratirodhi starch hota he, jo pach nahin paata or glucose ke rup main avashoshit nahin ho paata, nimna glysemk pratikriya or sambhavat: laabhakaari prabhaav kii ek badi maatra main hota he, jiaai kii bajaay, kam urja ghanatv or pratirodhi starch ke kinvan utpaadon ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, it is extremely important that there is a conflict between low-gi diets, which are tested using the approved GI method and low-glycemic diets, which reveal a low glycemic response, not because they have low GI
 Not be born yadi ek vyakti carbohydrate se apane calories kaa 50% kii khapat karata he, to glysemic suchakank use usee maatra main calories ko upyog main laane ke yogya banaata he or usamen glucose or insulin kaa str nimna, adhik sthir hota he

 unka vikaas aam taur par sakriy va sthir rahaa, lekin, bich main mithe va kadavi smritiyaan bhi raheen
 In these 55 years, there were many diversions in the relations between the two countries

 However, in the 1960s, relations between China and India entered into a cold period
 is ke baavjood donon ke maitreepurn sambandh kai hajaar varsh puraane hai
 Therefore, this winter was like a short wave in a historic long river

 As china-india relations progressed, the ambassadorial efforts of the governments of the two countries once again restored ambassador-level diplomatic relations between the two
 1980 ke dashak se 1990 ke dashak ke madhya tak china va bharat ke sambandhon main garmaahat aa chuki thi
 However, in the year 1998, with the release of five missiles in the relations between the two countries, the coldness once again came

 There has been increased movement between senior officials from China and India
 bharat sthit bhootpurv chini rajdoot chyo kong ne kaha, ab china-bharat sambandh ek naye kaal main pravesh kar chuke hai
 In the years that followed, there was increased movement between the leaders of China and India
 varsh 2001 main purv chini netaa lee fung ne bharat kii yatra kii
 In 2002, former Chinese Prime Minister Xu Rong Ji visited India

 This Declaration also clarified both important bilateral problems and regional issues on both sides
 ise bhavi dwipaksheeya sambandhon ke vikaas kaa nirdesan karne vaala mile ke pathar kii haisiyat vaala dastavej bhi mana gaya
 The relations between China and India are growing further on the old foundation
 videsh niti par china va bharat bahudhruviya duniya kii sthapana karne kaa paksh lete hai, prabhutvvaadi va bal kii raajnneeti kaa virodh karte hai or kisi ek shaktishaalee desh ke vishwa kii police banane kaa virodh karte hai
 How to deal with the current disputes in international relations and how to treat them between countries, these two problems stand before different countries
 china va bharat maanate hai ki unke dwaara pravartit kiye gayi shantipurna sashastitv ke paanch siddhant sanyukt raashtra ke charter ke un lakshyon tathaa siddhanton ko pratibimbit karte hai, jinka duniya ke vibhinn deshon dwaara paalan kiya janaa chahie
 Five principles of peaceful coexistence i
e
 Panchsheel were introduced by China, India and Myanmar in the month of June 1954
 panchasheel china va bharat dwaara duniya kii shanti va suraksha main kiya gaya ek mahatvapurn yogadan he, or aaj tak donon deshon kii janata kii jabaan par he
 The main theme of these principles established in relation to the relations of the countries - respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, do not attack each other, do not interfere in each other's internal affairs and equality and mutual Peaceful coexistence should be maintained on the basis of profit
 ye siddhant vishwa ke anek deshon dwaara sweekaar kar liye gayi hai or dwipaksheeya sambandhon par hue antarrashtriya sammelnon va dastavejon main darj kiye gayi hai
 In the discussion of Panchsheel's history, former Chinese Ambassador to India Mr
 Chen Ray Shan said, Before the Second World War, very few countries in Asia and Africa had attained independence
 lekin, dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad, upniveshvaadi vyavastha bhang honi shuru hui
 India and Myanmar gained independence and later China too
 asia main sab se pehle swatantraaa praapt karne vaale desh hone ke naate, unhen deshon kii prabhusatta va pradeshik akhandla kaa kaayam rahanaa bada aavashyak laga or unhen vibhinn deshon ke sambandhon kaa nirdesan karne ke siddhant kii zarurat padi
 Therefore, the leaders of these three countries together called for Panchsheel
 panchasheel ne antarrashtriya sambandhon kii saidhantik va yatharth kaaryvaayiyon main rachanaatmak yogadan kiya
 Former Indian President Narayanan discussed the importance of Panchsheel in this way
 panchasheel kaa aaj bhi baari mahatv he
 It has been the guiding standard for settling relations between countries for a long time
 ek shantipurna duniya kii sthapana karne ke liye panchasheel kaa karyavyan karnaa atyant mahatvapurn he
 It is clear from the history and international reality that Panchsheel's vitality is very strong
 use vyapak janata dwaara sweekaar kiya ja chukaa he
 Countries adopting different social systems accept the ideology of Panchsheel
 logon ne maan liya he ki panchasheel shanti va sahyog ke liye laabhadaayak he or antarrashtriya kanoonon va maapdandon se purna rup se mail khaataa hai
 Changes are happening in today's world
 panchasheel kaa prachaar-prasar aaj kii kuch samasyaon ke hal ke liye bahut laabhadaayak he
 Therefore, Panchsheel is still the basis of a peaceful world order
 us kaa aaj bhi baari arth va mahatv he or bhavishya main bhi rahegaa
 Searching for peace and development is the same desire of the people of the present world
 panchasheel kii shanti va vikaas kii vichaardhaara ne antarrashtriya sambandhon ke swasth vikaas ko aage badhaayaa he or bhavishya main bhi vah ek shantipurna, sthir, nyaaypurna va uchit nayi antarrashtriya vyavastha kii sthapana main ahm bhoomika adaa karegi
 In order to further develop the relationship between the two countries, former Indian President Narayanan in 2000, during a state visit to China, suggested the convening of a forum of eminent personalities from India and China in talks with former Chinese President Chiang Jin Min

 In 2003, Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited China and issued a joint manifesto with Chinese Prime Minister One Cha Pao
 ghoshnaptr main bharat ne aupchaarik rup se kaha ki bharat tibet ko china kaa ek bhaag maanata he
 In this way, the Government of India, for the first time, openly highlighted its stand on the problem of Tibet through a formal document, which received praise from the Chinese government
 is ke alaava, china va bharat ke bich seemaa samasya bhi lambe arase se ansulajhi rahi he
 To solve this problem, China and India held talks in several phases from December 1981 and achieved some progress among them

 Consultation is going on at the level of special representatives of China and India to solve the border problem

 Former Chinese Ambassador to India Chyo Kang said, "we should depart from a forward-looking stance towards the problem left behind by history
" china sarkaar ne seemaa samasya ke hal kii sakriy rukh apanaai he
 China hopes that the appropriate and justifiable methods accepted by both should be explored through friendly dialogue, in the spirit of mutual reconciliation and trust
 vishwaas he ki jab donon paksh aapasi vishwaas, sulah va riyaayat dene kii abhilaashaa se prasthaan karenge to china-bharat seemaa samasya ke hal ke tareekon kii khoj kar hi lee jaaegi
 At this time, China and India are engaged in their peaceful development
 21veen shatabdi ke china va bharat pratidwandi hai or mitra bhi
 There is widespread agreement in both on international affairs
 aankade bataate hai ki sanyukt raashtra sangh main vibhinn sawaalon par hue matdaan main adhikansh samay, bharat or china kaa paksh samaan rahaa
