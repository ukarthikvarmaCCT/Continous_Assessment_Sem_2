 Many Acharyas and scholars have commented on Gita
 sampradaayon ke anusaar unki sankshipt suchi is prakaar he : Apart from these, there is a famous commentary on the name of Maharashtrian saint Gyandev or Dnyaneshwarite Bhavarthadeepika, which reveals the knowledge of Gita in an emotional poetry style

 Published in Poona, the Gita occupies an important place in literature
 usne gita ke mul arthon ko vidwaanon tak pahunchaane main aisa mode diya he jo shankaracharya ke baad aaj tak sambhav nahin hua tha
 In fact, Shankaracharya's commentary gives the main meaning of the Gita, while the Tilak proves the Gita as the proponent of karma
 bhagavadgita par uplabdh sabhi bhashyon main shri jaidayal goyandaka kii tatv vivechni sarvaadhik lokapriy tathaa jansulabh he

 Srimad Bhagavad Gita is maintaining its importance in the changing social scenario and due to this technological development has increased its availability, and tried to make it more comprehensible
 doordarshan par prasaarit dharawahik mahabharat main bhagavadgita vishesh aakarshan rahi, vahiin dharawahik shrikrishna main bhagavadgita par atyadhik vishad shodh karke use kai kadiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa ke rup main dikhaaya gaya
 One of its special things was that attempts were made to answer common man's doubts related to Gita through Arjuna's questions
 iske alaava nitish bharadwaj krit dharawahik gita-rahasy to purnataya gita ke hi vibhinn ayaamon par kendrit rahaa
 Even today many websites on the Internet give detailed information on this subject through multimedia
 shrimadbhagavadgita vartmaan main dharm se zyada jivan ke prati apane darshanik drushtikon ko lekar bharat main hi nahin videshon main bhi logon kaa dhyaan apni or aakarshith kar rahi he
 The Gita's message management of Nishkam Karma is also appealing to the gurus
 vishwa ke sabhi dharmon kii sabase prasiddh pustakon main shaamil he
 The publication which makes books of religious literature like Geeta Press Gorakhpur available at a very low price has also contributed greatly to the general public by publishing Srimad Bhagavad Gita in various shapes and meanings
 gita kaa upadesh atyant puraatan yoga he
 Sri Bhagavan says i first told it to Surya
 surya gyaan kaa pratik he atah shri bhagavan ke vachanon kaa taatpary he ki prithvi utpatti se pehle bhi anek swaroop anusandhan karne vaale bhakton ko yah gyaan de chukaa hoon
 It is a divine voice that has the essence and basis of all life
 main koun hoon? yah deh kya he? is deh ke saath kya meraa aadi or ant he? deh tyaag ke pashchaat kya meraa astitv rahegaa? yah astitv kahan or kis rup main hoga? mere sansar main aane kaa kya kaaran he? mere deh tyaagane ke baad kya hoga, kahan janaa hoga? kisi bhi jigyaasu ke hriday main yah baaten nirantar gumti rahati hai
 We always think about these things and do not know ourselves, our nature
 gita shaastra main in sabhi ke prashnon ke uttar sahaj dhang se shri bhagavan ne dharm samvaad ke madhyam se diye hai
 This body in which the 36 elements work together due to the presence of the soul, is called Kshetra and Jeevatma resides in this Kshetra, he is the lord of this body but there is also a third man, when he appears; Overlive means this body with 36 elements and destroys the individual soul
 yahi uttam purush hi param sthiti or param sat he
 Not only this, the real scientific and rational description of the movement of the soul located in the body and leaving the body is mentioned in the Gita Shastra
 jeevatma nity he or aatma ko jeev bhav kii prapti hui he
 At the death of the body, the individual moves in different vaginas according to his order
 gita kaa prarambh dharm shabd se hota he tathaa gita ke atharahawein adhyay ke ant main ise dharm samvaad kaha he
 Dharma means one who holds or has been held
 dhaaran karne vaala jo he use aatma kaha gaya he or jise dhaaran kiya he vah prakruti he
 The soul is the seed of this world i
e
 father and nature is the vagina that conceives, ie mother
 dharm shabd kaa prayog gita main aatm swabhaav evam jeev swabhaav ke liye jagah jagah prayukt hua he
 It is necessary to understand religion and unrighteousness in this context
 aatma kaa swabhaav dharm he athwa kaha jaay dharm hi aatma he
 The nature of the soul is absolute pure knowledge, knowledge itself is the inexhaustible abode of joy and peace
 iske vipareet agyaan, ashaanti, klesh or adharm kaa dyotak he
 The soul is the source of renewable knowledge
 gyaan shakti kii vibhinn maatra se kriya shakti kaa udai hota he, prakati kaa janm hota he

 satva-raj kii adhikta dharm ko janm detii he, tam-raj kii adhikta hone par asuri vrittiyaan prabal hoti or dharm kii sthapana arthath gunon ke swabhaav ko sthapit karne ke liye, satogun kii vruddhi ke liye, avinashi brahmi sthiti ko praapt aatma apane sankalp se deh dhaaran kar avatar grihan karti he
 The whole Gita is a squeeze of scripture, always keep the intellect subtle and put it in the spirit of Mahabuddhi and keep doing the actions of the world as per your nature in a simple way
 swabhaavgat karm karnaa saral he or duusare ke swabhaavgat karm ko apanaakar chalanaa kathin he kyonki prayek jeev bhinn bhinn prakruti ko lekar janma he, jeev jis prakruti ko lekar sansar main aayaa he usamen saralata se uskaa nirvaah ho jaataa he
 Shri Bhagavan has repeatedly said in the entire Gita Shastra to be self-centered, self-located
 swaabhaavik karm karte hue buddhi kaa anasakt hona saral he atah ise hi nishchayatmak maarg mana he
 Although seen separately, Gyan Yoga, Wisdom Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga etc
 have been preached in the Gita, but if considered from a subtle point of view, all yoga can be done by surrendering it to Sri Bhagavan with wisdom
 Nishkam Karma Yoga is proven automatically

 In the same way, the knowledge enunciated in the Gita by Sri Krishna was even before Krishna, which is popular today as the Srimad Bhagavad Gita

 Tattvamasi is one of the four Mahavakyas described in the ancient Hindu scriptures and Upanishads of India, which literally means "he is you"
 xxrep 5 ★ mahavakya he tatvamasi xxrep 5 ★ Tattvamasi means, that is you
 vah dur nahin he, bahut paas he, paas se bhi zyada paas he
 He is yours
 yah mahavakya he
 The meaning of Mahavakya means that if you hold this one sentence and do some research, then the ultimate state of life becomes available
 isliye isko mahavakya kehete hai
 Then there is no need for any scripture, and there is no need for any Vedas and any Quran and Bible
 tatvamasi paryaapt veda he
 If one recites this one sentence properly, contemplate it, does nididhyasana, does samadhi, then there is no need for any other scripture
 mahavakya kaa arth he: punjeebhoot, jisamen sab aa gaya ho
 This Mahavakya is a formula for spiritual chemistry
 isamen teen baaten kahi hai tat, vah, tvam, tu; donon ek hai — teen baaten hai
 He and you are one, that's all
 lekin sara vedant, sara anubhav rishiyon kaa, in teen main aa jaataa he
 The formulas like this are mathematics - existence, God and you are the inner consciousness, they are not two, they are one
 itnaa hi saar he samast vedon kaa, phir baaki sab failaav he
 Therefore such a sentence is called Mahavakya in the Upanishads
 is tarah ke vaakya purna maun main sune jane chahie
 Therefore, for thousands of years, the sages in India insisted that the supreme pride should not be written
 unka aagrah bada keemtee tha
 But it was impossible to complete
 likhnaa padaa
 For thousands of years, it was insisted that the supreme knowledge should not be written
 bahut log, visheshkar bhashashasthri, linguist sochate hai ki chunki lipi nahin thi, likhane kaa upaay nahin tha, isliye bahut din tak veda or upanishad nahin likhe gaye
 They think wrong
 kyonki jo tatvamasi jaisaa anubhav uplabdh kar sakate the, jo is mahavakya ko anubhav main laa sakate the, ve likhane kii kala na khoj lete, yah asambhav maaloom padataa he
 There was an art of writing, but he was not ready to write
 kyon? kyonki aise mahavakya likh die jaaen, to har koi har kisi haalat main pard letaa he
 And after reading this, we get into the illusion that they understood
 ye vaakya kisi vishesh gun, kisi vishesh avasthaa, chitt kii koi vishesh paristhiti main hi sunne yogya hai
 That is when they enter the life
 har kabhi sun lene par khatra he
 There are two dangers, one will be missed, and i will know, and the second danger is that because of this information you rarely prepare to create the mood in which it should have been heard

 The exact difference of pronunciation is also seen in the word 'ramzan' which is found in both 'ramazan' and 'ramadan' forms

 Nilotic people gradually began to grow in the region after the disintegration of the Nubian empire of Makuria and Alodia in the contemporary times of the fourteenth century
 Until about 1500 South Sudan was mostly controlled by speakers of Central Sudanic languages
 Linguistic evidence shows that over time Nilotic speakers, such as the Dinka, Shilluk, and Luo, took over
 These groups who currently live around the Sudd marshlands migrated down Southward from Northern and Central Sudan around the time of the collapse of Nubia and the strives that ensued among the many people who were ruled by the Kings of Nubia
 Archaeological evidence shows that a culture based on transhumant cattle raising has been present in that area since 3000 BCE, and the Nilotic culture in that area may thus be continuous to that date
 Archaeological evidence as well as the physical evidence in the livlihood of the Nilotes including their dome-shaped houses and tukuls shows that they may have made an enormous contribution to the governance and wealth of the Nubia Kingdom before and during the 25th Dynasty
 a few Central Sudanic groups remain such as the Mari and the Moru
 The Nilotic expansion seems to have begun in the 14th century
 This coincides with the collapse of the Christian Nubian kingdoms of Makuria and Alodia and the penetration of Arab traders into central Sudan
 From the Arabs the South Sudanese may have obtained new breeds of hump-less cattle
 Archaeologist Roland Oliver notes that the period also shows an Iron Age beginning among the Nilotics
 These factors may explain how the Nilotic speakers expanded to dominate the region
 One theory is that it was pressure from the Shilluk that drove the Funj people north, who would establish the Sultanate of Sennar
 The Dinka remained in the Sudd area, carrying their transhumance economy
 The Shilluk spread east to the banks of the white Nile by the 16th century under the legendary leadership of Nyikang, who is said to have ruled the Shilluk c
1490 to c
1517
 The Shilluk gained control of the west bank of the river as far north as Kosti in Sudan
 There they established an economy based on cattle raising, cereal farming, and fishing, with small villages located along the length of the river
 The Shilluk developed an intensive system of agriculture, and the Shilluk lands in the 17th century had a population density similar to that of the Egyptian Nile lands
 While the Dinka were protected and isolated from their neighbors, the Shilluk were more involved in international affairs
 The Shilluk controlled the west bank of the White Nile, but the other side was controlled by the Funj Sultanate, and there were regular conflicts between the two
 The Shilluk had the ability to quickly raid outside areas by war canoe, and had control of the waters of the Nile
 The Funj had a standing army of armored cavalry, and this force allowed them to dominate the plains of the sahel
 Shilluk traditions tell of King Odak Ocollo who ruled c
 1630 and led them in a three decade war with Sennar over control of the White Nile trade routes
 The Shilluk allied with the Sultanate of Darfur and the Kingdom of Takali against the Funj, but the capitulation of Takali ended the war in the Funj's favour
 In the later 17th century the Shilluk and Funj allied against the Jieng, a group of Dinka who rose to power in the border area between the Funj and Shilluk
 The Shilluk political structure gradually centralized under the a king or reth
 The most important is Reth Tugo who ruled c
 1690 to 1710 and established the Shilluk capital of Fashoda
 The same period saw the gradual collapse of the Funj sultanate, leaving the Shilluk in complete control of the White Nile and its trade routes
 The Shilluk military power was based on control of the river
 The non-nilotic Azande people, who entered southern Sudan in the 16th century, established the region's largest state
 The Azande are the third largest nationality in Southern Sudan
 They are found in Maridi, Iba, Yambio <nzara, ezon, Tambura and Nagere Counties in the tropical rain forest belt of western Equatoria and Bahr el Ghazal
 In the 18th century, the Avungara people entered and quickly imposed their authority over the Azande
 Avungara power remained largely unchallenged until the arrival of the British at the end of the 19th century
 Geographical barriers protected the southerners from Islam's advance, enabling them to retain their social and cultural heritage and their political and religious institutions
 The Dinka people were especially secure in the Sudd marshlands, which protected them from outside interference, and allowed them to remain secure without a large armed forces
 The Shilluk, Azande, and Bari people had more regular conflicts with neighbouring states
 In 1821 the Sennar Sultanate to the north collapsed in the face of an invasion by Egypt under the Muhammad Ali Dynasty
 After consolidating their control over northern Sudan, the Egyptian forces began to foray south
 In 1827 Ali Khurshid Pasha led a force through the Dinka lands and in 1830 led an expedition to the junction of the White Nile and the Sobat
 The most successful missions were led by Admiral Salim Qabudan who between 1839 and 1842 sailed the White Nile, reaching as far south as modern Juba
 The Egyptian forces attempted to set up forts and garrisons in the region, but disease and defection forced their quick abandonment
 While claimed by the Khedives of Egypt, they had no real authority over the region
 In 1851, under pressure from foreign powers, the government of Egypt opened the region to European merchants and missionaries
 The Europeans found a large supply of ivory, but found the local Bari had little interest in anything they were selling
 As a result the merchants often turned to force, seizing the ivory, even this proved not to be economical and the merchant ventures had little success
 Christian missionaries also established posts in the region, with the Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa, covering the region
 The missionaries also had little impact on the region in the early 19th century
 The lack of formal authority was filled in the 1850s by a set of powerful merchant princes
 In the east Muhammad Ahmad al-aqqad controlled much land, but the most powerful was al-zubayr Rahma Mansur who came to control the Bahr el Ghazal and other parts of South Sudan
 al-zubayr was a merchant from Khartoum, who hired his own private army and marched south
 He set up a network of trading forts known as zaribas through the region, and from these forts controlled local trade
 The most valuable commodity was ivory
 In previous centuries Sudanese merchants had not placed a high price on ivory, but the period of Egyptian rule coincided with a great increase in global demand as middle class Americans and Europeans began to purchase pianos and billiard balls
 To manage the trade al-zubayr needed labour, and thus also began to capture a significant number of slaves
 To his mercenary force, he also conscripted a large slave army
 Due to trade disputes with the Sultanate of Darfur al-zubayr went to war against that kingdom and in 1874 defeated their forces and killed Ibrahim, the last Fur Sultan
 The Khedive of Egypt, Isma'il Pasha, was concerned over the growing power al-zubayr, and established the province of Equatoria and planned to colonized the area
 Isma'il hired the British explorer Samuel Baker in 1869 to govern the area, and supplied him with soldiers and generous financing, but Baker was unable to extend Egyptian power over the area
 To dispose of al-zubayr, Isma'il dispatched the mercenary leader Muhammed al-bulalwi and promised him the governorship of Bahr el Ghazal, if he defeated al-zubayr
 Instead al-zubayr routed the invaders and killed al-bulalwi
 In 1873 Isma'il thus agreed to appoint al-zubayr as governor
 Isma'il was still threatened by al-zubayr and his independent base of power
 The British media was also filled with stories about al-zubayr the "slaver King
" In 1874 Charles George Gordon was appointed governor of Equatoria
 In 1877 al-zubayr traveled to Cairo to ask for the governoship of Darfur as well, but was placed under house arrest by Is'mail
 Gordon defeated al-zubayr's son, ending the merchants' control of the region
 Despite this, Gordon still failed to exert authority over any territory in the region beyond the lands immediately around his few forts
 In 1878, Gordon was replaced by Emin Pasha 
 The Mahdist Revolt did not spread south to the non-muslim region, but cut off the South Sudan from Egypt, leaving Emin Pasha isolated and without resources
 He was rescued in a mission led by Henry Morton Stanley
 Equatoria ceased to exist as an Egyptian outpost in 1889
 Important settlements in Equatoria included Lado, Gondokoro, Dufile and Wadelai
 In 1947, British hopes to join the southern part of Sudan with Uganda were dashed by the Juba Conference, to unify northern and southern Sudan
 The region has been negatively affected by two civil wars since before Sudanese independence, resulted in serious neglect, lack of infrastructural development, and major destruction and displacement
 More than 2
5 million people have been killed, and more than five million have become externally displaced while others have been internally displaced, becoming refugees as a result of the civil war and war-related impacts
 In 1955, one year before Sudan achieved independence, the First Sudanese Civil War started, with aims of achieving representation and more regional autonomy
 For seventeen years, the Sudanese government fought the Anyanya rebel army
 In 1971, former army Lt
 Joseph Lagu gathered all the guerilla bands under his South Sudan Liberation Movement
 This was the first time in the history of the war that the separatist movement had a unified command structure to fulfill the objectives of secession and the formation of an independent state in South Sudan
 It was also the first organization that could claim to speak for, and negotiate on behalf of, the entire south
 Mediation between the World Council of Churches and the All Africa Conference of Churches eventually led to the signing of the Addis Ababa Agreement in 1972, which established the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region
 In 1983, President of Sudan Gaafar Nimeiry declared all Sudan an Islamic state under Shari'a law, including the non-islamic majority of the southern region
 The Southern Sudan Autonomous Region was abolished on 5 June 1983, ending the Addis Ababa Agreement
 In direct response to this, the Sudan People's Liberation Army / Movement was formed under the leadership of John Garang, and the Second Sudanese Civil War erupted
 Several factions split from the SPLA often along ethnic lines and were funded and armed by Khartoum, with the most notable being the spla-nasir in 1991 led by Riek Machar
 As a result of the infighting, more southerners died at each other's hands than were killed by northerners during the war
 In the Bor massacre in 1991, an estimated 2000 civilians were killed by spla-nasir and armed Nuer civilians and another estimated 25,000 died from the resulting famine in the following years
 This war lasted for twenty-two years, becoming the longest civil war in Africa
 In 2005, Comprehensive Peace Agreement, mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, as well as igad-partners, a consortium of donor countries, was signed in Nairobi and autonomous government of Southern Sudan was formed
 This agreement lasted until 2011, when South Sudan declared independence
 From 9–15 janvari 2011 people from South Sudan voted on whether they should break away from Sudan and declare independence
 On 30 janvari 2011, the results had shown that 98
83% of the population had voted for independence from Sudan
 At midnight on 9 July 2011, South Sudan became an independent country under the name Republic of South Sudan
 On 14 July 2011, South Sudan became the 193rd member state of the United Nations
 On 28 July 2011, South Sudan joined the African Union as its 54th member state
 Certain disputes still remain with Sudan, such as sharing of the oil revenues, as an estimated 80% of the oil in both Sudans is from South Sudan, which would represent amazing economic potential for one of the world's most deprived areas
 The region of Abyei still remains disputed and a separate referendum is due to be held in Abyei on whether they want to join North or South Sudan
 South Sudan is currently at war with at least seven armed groups
 According to UN figures, the various conflicts affect nine of its ten states, with tens of thousands displaced
 The fighters accuse the government of plotting to stay in power indefinitely, not fairly representing and supporting all tribal groups while neglecting development in rural areas
 Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army also operates in a wide area that includes South Sudan
 In the SPLA / M's attempt to disarm rebellions among the Shilluk and Murle, they burned scores of villages, raped hundreds of women and girls and killed an untold number of civilians
 Civilians alleging torture claims fingernails have been torn out, burning plastic bags dripped on children to make their parents hand over weapons and villagers burned alive in their huts if rebels were suspected of spending the night there
 In May 2011, the SPLA allegedly set fire to over 7,000 homes in Unity State
 The UN reports many of these violations and the frustrated director of one Juba-based international aid agency calls them "human rights abuses off the Richter scale"
 In 2010, the CIA issued a warning that "over the next five years,


a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur in southern Sudan
" Inter-ethnic fighting intensified in 2011 in Jonglei state between the Nuer White Army of the Lou Nuer and the Murle
 The White Army warned it would also fight South Sudanese and UN forces
 The White Army released a statement, to "wipe out the entire Murle tribe on the face of the earth as the only solution to guarantee long-term security of Nuer’s cattle
" Activists, including Minority Rights Group International, warn of genocide in the current Jonglei conflict
 In March 2012, the Sudanese Air Force bombed areas of the South Sudanese state of Unity, near the border of the Sudanese province of South Kordofan
 South Sudanese forces responded by seizing the Heglig oil field on April 10
 Sudanese troops launched a counter offensive and forced the South Sudanese Army to withdraw nine days later
 On 20 April South Sudan announced it had begun a phased withdrawal from Heglig, while Sudan claimed it took it by force
 Afterwards, Sudanese president Omar al-bashir held a victory rally in Khartoum
 On 22 april more fighting broke out on the border as Sudanese soldiers backed by tanks and artillery launched three waves of attacks six miles deep inside South Sudan
 At least one South Sudanese soldier was killed and two wounded in the attack
 The two parties recommenced negotiations in June 2012 under mediation by the African Union's envoy Thabo Mbeki
 On 27 sitambar Sudanese President Omar al-bashir and South Sudanese President Salva Kiir signed eight agreements in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which led the way to resume important oil exports and create a six-mile demilitarised zone along their border
 The agreements allows for the return of 350,000 barrels of South Sudanese oil to the world market
 In addition, the agreements include an understanding on the parameters to follow in regards to demarcating their border, an economic-cooperation agreement and a deal to protect each other's citizens
 Certain issues remain unsolved and future talks are scheduled to resolve them
 At the same time as the ongoing General debate of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly on the same day, South Sudan was scheduled to speak
 Vice President Riek Machar outlined what agreements were signed, but lamented the lack of a resolution on Abyei
 In mid-march 2013, both countries began to withdraw their forces from the border area in a bit to creating a demilitarized buffer zone and resume South Sudanese oil production for export through Sudan
 In early April South Sudanese oil started to flow through pipelines in Sudan again
 Though Sudanese President Omar al-bashir threatened to cut oil transit through his country from South Sudan, South Sudanese President Salvar Kiir accused him of mobilizing for war and said that he would not go to war over the oil transit issue
 On 6 june 2011 armed conflict broke out between the forces of Northern and Southern Sudan, ahead of the scheduled independence of the South on 9 July
 This followed an agreement for both sides to withdraw from Abyei
 By late June, several international interlocutors including the United Nations advanced a proposal to base 4,200 Ethiopian soldiers in Abyei to serve as peacekeepers
 President Salva Kiir alleged that on 14 disambar 2013, a faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Army loyal to former vice president Riek Machar attempted a coup d'état and that the attempt was put down the next day
 However, fighting has continued
 Machar denied trying to start a coup and called for Kiir to resign
 At least 500 were reported to have died and over 400 injured
 There are reports of people fleeing clashes in Bor, the capital of Jonglei state
