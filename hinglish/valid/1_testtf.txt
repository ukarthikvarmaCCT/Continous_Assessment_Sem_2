shakti gunank vibhavaantar tathaa dhara ke bich ke kalaantar ke kojya ke baraabar hota he
 Power multiplier = p / s arthath shakti gunank acha hone ke liye jaruri he ki voltage or dhara ke bich main kalaantar bahut kam ho
 When the current is behind the voltage, it is called lagging power factor; When the current is ahead of the voltage, it is called 'leading power-factor'
 udyogon main induction motor evam anya prerakatv-yukt lodon ke kaaran shakti-gunank praaia: pichhadaa hua hi rahata he
 It is not considered good to take electric power at a power coefficient of less than 1 by a load and most power supply companies provide some penalty for it
 kam shakti gunank kaa sidhaa sa arth yah he ki jo kaam 'utility' se kam dhara lekar hi kiya ja saktaa uske liye adhik dhara lee ja rahi he
 Due to this greater current, the transmission line increases power loss; Transformers, circuit breakers and other things require higher ratings
 ek aur bat ye hoti hai ki cos0 ka man adhiktam hota hai When the current is not cyclic, the power multiplier is referred to in terms of the first harmonic of the fury range of the current

 pandav paanch bhai the - yudhisthir, bhimsen, arjuna, nakul tathaa sahadev
 The Pandava's father's name was Pandu
 ve bade hi pratapi kuruvanshi raja the! pandu kii do patniyaan thim - kunti tathaa maadri
 Yudhishthira was the mother of Bhima and Arjuna and was the son of Nakula and Sahadeva Madri
 ek baar raja pandu apni donon patniyon - kunti tathaa maadri - ke saath akhet ke liye van main gayi
 There, he saw a mating pair of deer
 pandu ne tatkaal apane baan se us mrug ko ghayal kar diya
 The dying deer cursed Pandu, "rajan! There will be no cruel man like you in this world
 tuune mujhe maithun ke samay baan maaraa he atah jab kabhi bhi tu maithunarat hoga teri mrityu ho jaayegi
 " is shaap se pandu atyant duhkhi huye or apni raniyon se bole, "he deviyon! ab main apni samast vaasanaon kaa tyaag kar ke is van main hi rahoonga tum log hastinapur laut jaao" unke vachanon ko sun kar donon raniyon ne duhkhi hokar kaha, "nath! ham aapke bina ek kshan bhi jivit nahin rah saktin
 Please also please keep us with you in the forest
 " pandu ne unke anurodh ko sweekaar kar ke unhen van main apane saath rahane kii anumati de di
 During this time, King Pandu saw sages and sages on Amavasya going to see Brahma
 unhone un rishi-muniyon se swayan ko saath le jane kaa aagrah kiya
 On his request, the sages and sages said, "rajan! No childless person can be entitled to go to Brahmaloka, so we are unable to take you with us
" " After listening to the sages and monks, Pandu said to his wife, "O Kunti, it is getting worse for me to be born because a childless person cannot get rid of father-debt, sage-loan, god-loan and man-loan
 Can you help me get a son? " Kunti said, "O Aryaputra! Durvasa Rishi has given me such a mantra by which i can get any thing desired by invoking any god
 aap ajna karen main kis devtaa ko bulaauun
 "at this, Pandu ordered to invite religion
 dharm ne kunti ko putr pradaan kiya jiskaa naam yudhisthir rakhaa gaya
 Later, Pandu ordered Kunti to invite Vayudev and Indradev twice
 vayudev se bhim tathaa indra se arjuna kii utpatti hui
 After this, by the command of Pandu, Kunti initiated the mantra to Madri
 maadri ne ashwanikumaron ko aamantrit kiya or nakul tathaa sahadev kaa janm hua
 One day King Pandu was touring along the Madri on the banks of Sarita in the forest
 vaataavaran atyant ramnik tha or sheethal-mand-sugandhit vaayu chal rahi thi
 Suddenly Madri's dress flew away with the wind
 isse pandu kaa man chanchal ho uthaa or ve maithun me pravruth huye hi the ki shaapvash unki mrityu ho gai
 Madri sati with them, but Kunti returned to Hastinapur for the upbringing of her sons

 This is one of the world's leading airlines namakan prakriya : Under mutual help, there are behaviors that contribute to each other's life
 parantu aise vyavhaar jo dusron ke jeene main sahaayak hai, or praani ke apane jeene kii kshamta kam karte hai, darwin ke udvikas ke siddhant ko chunauti dene vaale maane gaye
 According to Wilson and Wilson, scientists have been discovering for the last 50 years how mutual aid, which also includes synonyms, cooperation, cooperation, etc
, evolved into beings
 jeev vaigyanik wilson ne 1975 main ek nayi shakha samajajeevigyaan shuru kii, jisamen aapasi sahaayta ek mahatvapurn samasya ke rup main ubhari
 But Wilson also considered the nature of the genetic unit or gene to be selfish, and said that the gene is committed to making as many copies as possible
 sahaayta dene vaale or lene vaale ko hone vaale laabh yaa haani ko kramshah jin main badhotaree yaa kami se aankaa gaya
 For which sports theory was imported from economics
 manovaigyanik feldman sahaayta ko maanav prakruti kaa ujala paksh bataate hai
 He describes the use of Lie and others in the 1980s, writing that the facilitator proceeds in this task only by looking at the benefits and disadvantages of this behavior
 feldman kaa maananaa he ki haalaanki paroapkaar yaa paryaaywad bhi sahaayta kaa hi ek chor he, kintu isamen atmotsarg par jor he, jaise, kisi vyakti kaa ek aag se jalte ghar main kisi ajnavi ke bachche ko bachaane ke liye kudana
 Halden argues that a person doing this kind of work will be beneficial only if he can save his relatives
 halden kaa tark neeche die gaye aapasi sahaayta ke paanch vaikalpik raaston kaa prakkathan he
 In this article, from changes in the multicellular group to the starvation of a cell organism amoeba to a large population that connects to the natural belief in humans, there are some forms of mutual aid that are being attempted to be understood through alternative paths of natural and cultural selection
 
 darwin ne apni pustak main sahopkaar ke kai udahaaran dekar, jaise keet varg or phulon kaa aapasi sambandh, likhaa ki yah do prajatiyon main, alag-alag, aapasi sangharsh kaa parinaam he
 He said in figurative language that, by artificial selection, man chooses the virtues of benefit in domestic animals, but by choosing nature, he chooses the qualities which are helpful in living of that creature
 yadi praani ke vyavhaar se duusare ke jeene main madad milti he, uskaa chayan tabhi hoga jab praani ke samooh ko laabh ho, jaise saamaajik keet madhumakhi, dimak, aadi
 Darwin did not extend these ideas, says Kropotkin, and instead of mutual cooperation to live, gave competition the main place in his theory
 lagbhag sau saal baad, vaigyanik kah rahe hai ki paraspar sahaayta yaa sahyog jivan kaa aadhaar he
 Mutual aid has expanded the most in humans, and along with spontaneous behavior, cultural, psychological, economic, and other aspects have been added to it
 is sandarbh main bhagwaan das ne samveg par apni pustak main aapasi sahaayta kaa vishesh ullekh kiya
 They envisaged mutual assistance by imagining three types of social exchanges
 is prakaar ke sambandhon main ek daata he to doosraa praapak, jise kisi vastu yaa seva kii zaroorat hoti he
 If there is abundance in the recipient of any other thing, then he will give it to the donor, and in view of this thing, he will be called the donor
 yah aapasi sahaayta kaa sabase saamaanya sambandh he
 It is also possible that a person is in a high position and has an item in abundance, yet a person of a lower level will give him that thing to make him happy
 teesri prakaar ke sambandh main ek oonchi shrenee kaa vyakti, jiske paas koi vastu bahutayat main he, uskaa thodaa sa hissaa swechha se nimna shrenee ke vyakti ko detaa he, jise uski zaroorat he
 Bhagwan Das considered this third type of relationship special, which is difficult to explain
 samaaj main ise paroapkaar kehete hai, bhagwaan das kehete hai, jab ki is vyavhaar se paropkaaree ko maansik laabh miltaa he
 Kropotkin said that mutual aid is an important factor in the evolution of animals
 isse jude tathy, jantuon or manushyon par kiye gaye nirikshan, unhone 1902 main apni pustak main rakhe
 In the book's foreword, Ashley Montagu wrote that, in fact, Kropotkin asserted the complementary side of natural selection in stark terms, which were suppressed by followers of Darwin
 mauntagu aage kehete hai ki ek sachche arajak ke naate unhone prakritik darshan ko dhyaan main rakhkar samta or aapasi sahaayta ko aadhaar mana
 Even with Gothe, full of natural talent, Kropotkin wrote, there was no hiding the intensity of mutual help among animals
 aadhunik udvikas ke visheshgy, braayen gudwin ne gothe kii jivan ke bare main gatisheel drushti se aage badhkar, kaha ki jivan kii utpatti hi koshikaon ke aapasi sahyog se hoti he, or yah kram vibhinn roopon main manushya ke saamaajik sansthaanon main bhi dikhaai detaa he
 Goodwin says that in biology competition, philanthropy, selfish genes, the living of the most capable, etc
 are used as metaphors or metaphors
 ek ore yah shabd in siddhanton ke matlab ko aam logon tak aasaani se le jate hai, duusari ore samakaleen saanskrithik soch main prachlit swaarth or pratispardhaa vaigyanik siddhanton kaa hissaa banate hai
 Goodwin further writes that in reality these metaphors have no intrinsic value
 aakhir jeev vigyaan ne pratispardhaa ko itnaa adhik mahatva kyon diya, gudwin ne poocha, sahyog ko kyon nahin udvikas kaa prerak mana
 Examples of mutual aid range from cell to complex human behavior
 uparokt tathyon se spasht he kii aapasi sahaayta ke udvikas ke bare main vaigyanikon kii soch main badlaav aa rahaa he
 Hardi says that there is not as much difference in competition between apes and humans as in cooperative behavior, that is, humans are highly social animals
 iskaa ek kaaran hardi ke anusaar bachche ke paalan-poshan main samooh ke anya sadasyon kaa yogadan he
 Animals and humans have many forms of mutual aid, which are often described by naturalists, but scientists did not give much importance to mutual aid
 cluton-brock ne bahut se aise vyavhaaron ko sahopakar kii shrenee main rakhaa he, jaise, nar sheron kaa ek saath apni seemaa kii suraksha ke liye dahaadna; africa main junglee kutto kaa ek saath milakar shikaar karnaa; poid babler dwaara milakar grih kshetra kii raksha ke liye awaz dena; mircat dwaara samuhik rup se shikari ko bhaagna; aadi
 The biggest problem in developing mutual aid is the members who benefit from others, but do not help others, who are called traitors or freeloaders
 muftakhor samooh main itani tezi se panpate hai kii paropkaaree peeche rah jate hai
 And eventually the group dissolves, so altruistic practices do not develop
 ek koshika amoeba, bhukhmaree se bachane ke liye bahukoshika dhaancha, jisamen kuch praani ajivit stambh or anya uske upree bhaag main beej vaala hissaa banaate hai
 Some of the social amoebas are those which do not form part of the column but benefit from the seed-making part, these are called freebies, and others are allies
 khare or unke saathiyon ne khoj main paaya ki saamaajik amoeba main asi kimen viksit ho jaati hai jo muftkhoron ko chinhit kar unke prati pratirodh kshamta viksit karti he, jisase muftakhor anya amibon dwaara kiye jane vaale aapasi sahaayta ke kaaryon main bhaag nahin le pate, atah unke laabh se vanchit rah jate hai or bhukhmari jaisi sthityon kaa saamana nahin kar pate
 Some species of amoebae are a good form of study of mutual aid, as they contain measures to prevent freedoms by genetic experiments
 wilson kehete hai ki merudandadhari praaniyon main manushyon main sahyog charam seemaa par he to yahi shrey kitvarg main himanoptera ke antargat aane vaali madhumakhiyon, chintiyon or dimakon aadi kii prajatiyon ko jaataa he
 Their complex social structures are called "real social conditions"

 Some work mechanically like laborers and are impotent
 atah in mazdooron ke vyavhaar ko samooh ke duusare sadasyon, maadaa va nar, ke prati paropkaaree kaha jaataa he
 Birds help each other in many ways, such as raising children, nesting, protecting predators, etc
 kuch pakshi pankhons se vishesh prakaar se susajjit hote hai, arthath pankh gahanon kii tarah lagate hai, jaise mor main nar kii kalgi or khubasurat dizine ke lambe pankh
 According to scientists, this type of feathers is important in males and females
 unhone dekha ki kuch pakshiyon main nar, maadaa or anya sadsy aapas main mil-jul kar bachche kaa sahakaari paalan-poshan karte hai, anumaan he ki yah pakshiyon main 8 se 17 pratishat he
 About 40% of the starling species in Africa have cooperative childbearing

 In this section, some examples of mutual cooperation have been taken in Rahesus Bandar, Hanuman Langur and Chimpanzee
 vaigyanikon ne paryavlokan se mili jaankaree ke aadhaar par rahesus bandaron main paae jane vaale sahyogi vyavhaar ko 12 shreniyon main baanta, antarjaatiy evam jatyabhyantar sahakaar, saamudayik akraman, saamudayik pratiraksha, sah-gaman, sah-charan, sangh-sushrusha, sangh-kreedaa, sah-jivita, sah-maitri, sahakaari akraman, sahakaari pratiraksha, or abhishman
 Some models of collaborative behavior may have originated in successfully coping with problems in the environment outside the group
 isamen shikari jantuon se bachaav mukhya he
 That means fear of being killed by enemies
 iske liye bandaron main antarjaatiy evam jatyabhyantar sahakaar, saamudayik akraman, saamudayik pratiraksha, sah-gaman, or sah-charan shreneeon ke vyavhaar dekhe gaye
 Some behaviors may help to develop a sense of cooperation among the group members
 yah vyavhaar sangh-sushrusha, sangh-kreedaa, sah-jivita, or sah-maitri shreneeon ke antargat aate hai
 Being together also creates competition among group members
 shaktishaalee bandar anya bandaron ko daraate hai yaa yaa un par hamalaa karte hai
 In order to maintain peace in the group some behaviors have evolved among monkeys that have three categories, cooperative attack, cooperative defense, and aggressiveness
 aapas main sahaayta kii uparokt 12 shreniyan hanuman langur main bhi dekhi gayi hai
 Hardy studied langurs on the hills of Abu in India in 1977 and observed some cooperative behavior
 akelaa yaa samooh main rahane vaala nar langur kabhi-kabhi duusare samooh ke mukhiya langur par hamalaa karata he
 When this transcendental male becomes the head of the group, he attacks the female females of that group
 is anaadhigrahita nar se apane bacchon ko bachane ke liye maadaaen ek dusre kii sahaayta karte paayi gayin
 Hardi has given a special description of the child's collaborative upbringing in Hanuman Langur
 or unhone kaha ki sneh siddhanth ke liye, rahesus bandar kii apeksha, hanuman langur ke bacchon kaa sahyogi paalan-poshan, ek praaroop ke liye zyada sateek he
 Jane Goodall observed chimpanzees occasionally attacking monkeys and children of herpes in the Tanzanian forest
 aisi ghatnaon ke samay chimpangiyon ko aapas main adbhut sahyog karte paae gaye
 Adult males appear to ambush the prey, first separating the child from the group of apes, and then surrounding it
 anya shv-vanar yadi apane bachche ko chhudaane kaa ytn karte to unhen bhaga dete
 When the main predator male managed to kill the child and started eating it, other chimpanzees appeared with outstretched hands

 In a few moments the chimpanzee pulled the box and ate the banana
 phir bakse ko itnaa baari kar diya kii ek chimpanji us ko na khinch sake
 Now keep the cages of both the chimpanzees close together, giving different ropes in the hands of both which were tied to the box on which the bananas were placed

 Therefore, thinking of natural selection is important both at the individual and group level, this is multi-level selection
 wilson ne donon, paristhitikeey or manovaigyanik, pahaluon par bal diya
 Wilson writes that anthropologists have described human society on three main levels
 sabase pehle samtawadi aadim samaaj or gaanv aate hai, phir chote-bade samant jo logon par shashan karata hai, or tisare str par chote-bade rajya aate hai jahaan kendriya satta rahati he
 The aspects of cooperation based on these levels of cultural development are given in three further sections

 Certain factors increase the risk of disease progression in a person
 inamen shaamil hai: The WCRF panel report Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective has conclusively found evidence that alcoholic beverages increase the risk of colorectal cancer in men
 NIAAA ne report di he ki: "jaanapadik-rogavigyaan sambandhi adhyayan ne paaya he ki alcohol khapat or colorectal cancer ke bich ek chota lekin drudh khuraaq-nirbhar judaa he, yahaan tak ki jab fibre or anya aahaareey karkon kaa niyantran karne par bhi
 haalanki vrihad maatra main adhyayan ke baavjood bhi uplabdh data se karaniya ko nirdhaarit nahin kar sakate
" "consumption of alcohol in large quantities can also increase the risk of colorectal cancer"
 One study found that "people who consume more than 30 grams of alcohol per day are seen to have a slightly higher risk of colorectal cancer in such people
" " ek or adhyayan main paaya gaya ki "aadhaar rekha par pratidin ek yaa ek se adhik maadak peya kii khapat lagbhag 70% se adhik brihadantra cancer ke khatre se judi hoti he

 Colorectal cancer is a disease arising from epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract and as a result of mutations with the Wnt signaling pathway
 kuch utparivartan anuvaanshik hote hai or anya uparjit hote hai
 The most common mutated gene of all colorectal cancers is the APC gene, which produces APC protins
 β ketenin par APC protein "brake" he
 Without APC, β-catenin moves into the kidney and binds to DNA and more proteins are activated
 
 In addition to defects in the wnt-apc-beta catenin signaling pathway, other mutations are required for the cell to become cancerous
 p53 jin dwaara TP53 protein utpaadit hota he, saamaanya rup se koshika vibhaajan par nigaraanee rakhata he or yadi unamem Wnt pathave dosha hota he to koshikaon ko nasht kar detaa he
 Ultimately, a cell line acquires a mutation in the p53 gene and transforms tissue from a gland into an invasive carcinoma
 
 Another apoptotic protein is tgf-β
 kam se kam colorectal cancer ke aadhe main, tgf-β main bhi ek vikarmanyan utparivartan hota he
 
 kuch jin onkosin hote hai - ve colorectal cancer main adhik abhivyakt hote hai
 For example, RAS, RAF and PI3K that normally stimulate cells to divide in response to growth factors and with mutations that oversimplify them can be mutated
 saamanytah PTEN PI3K ko roktaa he, lekin kabhi-kabhi PTEN utparivartit ho jate hai
 It takes many years for colorectal cancer to grow and if colorectal cancer is detected at an early stage, treatment may be possible

 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against taking aspirin in a clinical practice guideline
 The task force acknowledged that aspirin may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, but "concluded that high doses of aspirin and the use of NSAID for the prevention of colorectal cancer suppress the benefit"
 a meta-analysis later concluded that "an uncontrolled controlled trial of 300 mg or more of aspirin daily for about 5 years with a latency of 10 years is effective in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer"
 However, taking a dose of more than 81 mg per day for a longer period of time may increase blood flow

 san 1296 tak yah scotland main skin ke math main rakhaa jaataa tha jo parse shahar se kuch mile uttar main padataa he
 The 14th-century pastor and historian Walter Hemingford wrote in Latin - "apud Monasterium de Scone positus est lapis pergrandis in ecclesia Dei, juxta manum altare, concavus quidam ad modum rotundae cathedreaie confectus, in quo future reges loco quasi coronatis"
 " In the monastery of Scoon, near the high altar, in the temple of Bhagavan, there is a large stone which has been hollowed out from the inside to make a round chair and on which their kings are seated as a custom for their consecration
 " In 1296, King Edward i of England fought and defeated Scotland, and forcibly brought the stone of schoon to England
 unhone ek lakdi kaa singhaasana banwaaya jise ab raja edward kii kursi kaha jaataa he
 In this, he made an open house under the seating plank in which the stone of the schoon could come
 uske baad jab bhi kisi british samraat kaa rajbhishek hua he to vah isi kursi par baithkar hua he
 Because the chairman also sits on top of the stone of the schoon, he also becomes the king of Scotland according to the Scottish tradition

 The first of these revolutions is the grand revolution that occurred in England
 ise 'gauravshaalee kranti' athwa 'raktahin kranti' bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki is kranti main kisi bhi paksh ke vyakti ke rakt kii ek boond bhi nahin nikali or keval pradarshan evam vaartalap se hi kranti safal ho gai
 This bloodless revolution which took place in England in 1688 AD raised the demand for independence in America too
 america main shashan british sansad dwaara chalaaya jaataa tha jo americavsiyon ko sahan na tha
 They wanted to govern independently
 atah america upnivesh ne apni swatantraaa ke liye jo sangharsh kiya vahi america kranti kehalaata he

 Thereafter, dissenters in France started coming to England to escape the suppression of terror
 isse igland main asantosh failaa
 James also held Catholic abilities in university and government jobs
 james ke anya anuchit or avaidh kaaryon se england main teevr rosh or virodh fail gaya
 In the end James II had to leave England and Parliament invited his daughter Mary and her husband William to England and made Mary the ruler of England
 is ghatana ko england main mahaan kranti yaa vaibhavpurn kranti kehete hai
 In this revolution, not even a drop of blood was written and changes were made
 isse is kranti ko gauravshaalee kranti bhi kehete hai
 The glorious revolution of England is known as the bloodless revolution
 1688 een kii mahan angreji kranti shantipurvak sampann ho gai thi
 The king of England changed, the governance of England changed, but there was not a single drop of blood

 is prakaar 1688 i
 main england main shaskaon kaa parivartan bina rakt kii boond bahaae sampann ho gaya, isliye is ghatana ko vaibhavpurn mahaan shandaar kranti kehete hai
 The significance of this bloodless state revolution lies not in its thunder-bells, but in the prudence of its objectives and the far reaching of achievements
 yah ek yug nirmaankari ghatana he
 This started the era of popular government in England and the ruling came out of the hands of autocratic autocratic kings and came into the hands of Parliament
 iske parinaam adholikhit hue- This revolution brought an end to the long-standing conflict between the Stuart kings and Parliament
 is sangharsh main sansad kii vijay hui
 Now the actual ruling parliament in England became
 samprabhutaa sansad main nihit - kranti ke samay sansad ne ‘‘bill of ritis’’ paarit kar us par wiliam or meri kii sweekruti le lee
 With this the sovereignty of the Parliament was accepted and the supreme power of the king was abolished
 janata kii satt sarvopari maan lee gayi
 Sovereignty was accomplished in the king's theory, but in practice Parliament became paramount
 daivi siddhanton amaanya or sansad ke vyapak adhikaar - is kranti ne raja ke daivi adhikaron ko amaanya kar diya
 The king's authority to repeal any law passed by the Parliament was over
 raja, sansad kii sweekruti ke bina koi kar nahin laga saktaa
 This revolution made it clear that protecting civil liberties, enacting laws and levying taxes were within the purview of Parliament
 raja sansad ke adhikaron main kisi bhi prakaar se hastkshep nahin kar saktaa tha
 Establishment of constitutional monarchy - Before the revolution, the king was paramount, but after this the king remained a normal person under the Act of Parliament
 ab raja kii swechhacharita samaapt ho gayi
 His powers were restricted and controlled by Parliament
 ab england main vaidhanik rajtantr kaa yug prarambh hua or sansadeey pranali kaa shashan prarambh hua
 Parliament's authority over the army - Until now the army and its authority were under the king
 ab sansad ne vidroh adhinium paarit kar sena par purna niyantran sthapit kar liya
 This ended the military power of the king and also the chaos in the army
 catholic khatre kaa ant or england kaa dharm anglican - bill of ritis main yah tathy spasht kar diya gaya ki koi catholic raja yaa vah vyakti jiskaa vivaah catholic se hua ho england ke raaj singhaasana par asin nahin ho sakegaa
 In this way, England became free from the danger of Catholics forever
 dharmik kshetra main bhi yah spasht kar diya gaya ki anglican dharm england kaa vaastavik dharm he
 The king's authority over the church was abolished
 dharm ke maamalon main bhi sansad kaa uttaradayitv ho gaya
 This eventually created an atmosphere of religious tolerance in England
 sansad dwaara grih or videsh-niti kaa nirdhaaran : ab tak raja desh kii grih or videsh nitiyon kaa swayan sanchaalan karata tha
 He was inspired by his personal interests
 desh ke hiton kii upeksha kii jaati thi
 Due to this, the foreign policy adopted by the king at many times remained fruitless
 kintu kranti ke baad grih or videsh niti kaa nirdhaaran sansad ke paramashar or sweekruti se kiya jane laga
 This increased England's international prestige and expanded its colonial empire
 europe kii raajnneeti par prabhaav - england kii is shandaar kranti kaa prabhaav europe ke deshon par padaa
 Till now, autocratic arbitrary rajasatta was considered as ideal royalty in Europe
