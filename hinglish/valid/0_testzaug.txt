 Template: Infobox filesystemntfs is the standard file system for Windows NT, and later versions of Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, and Windows 7
 NTFS ne Microsoft ke Windows oparating system kii praathmik fil pranali ke rup main FAT fil system kaa sthaan le liya he
 NTFS is superior to FAT and HPFS in many ways because it is more supportive of metadata and uses advanced data structures for improved performance, reliability, and use of disk space, as well as some additional features such as security There is also access control list, and file system journaling
 1980 ke dashak ke madhya main, Microsoft or IBM ne aane vaali peedi ke liye chitramay oparating system banane ke liye ek sanyukt pariyojna kaa gathan kiya
 The project resulted in OS / 2, but Microsoft and IBM parted ways, disagreeing on several key issues
 OS / 2 IBM kii ek pariyojna bana rahaa
 Microsoft started work on Windows NT
 OS / 2 fil pranali HPFS main kai mahatvapurn nai suvidhaayen thim
 When Microsoft created its new operating system, they used many of these concepts for NTFS
 
 shaayad ek hi strot se utpann hone ke parinamswaroop, HPFS or NTFS discs vibhaajan kii pahchaan ke liye ek hi code tip kaa prayog karte hai
 It is unusual to use the same ID simultaneously because dozens of codes were available and other major file systems have their own codes
 FAT ke nau se zyada code hai 
 elgoridam, jo vibhaajan prakaar 07 main fil pranali kii pahchaan karti he, ko atirikt jaanch kerani chahie
 It is also clear that NTFS took some of its architectural design from the file-11 used by VMS
 yah shaayad hi aashcharya kii baat he kyonki dev katler VMS or Windows NT, donon par kaam kar rahe mukhya vyakti the

 V3

 Windows Vista introduced transactional NTFS, NTFS symbolic links, partition contraction, and self-healing, although these features are related to additional functionality of the operating system over the file system
 NTFS V3
0 apane purvavartiyon ke apekshaakrit kai nai suvidhaon se las he:spars fil suvidha, discs kota kaa upyog, ripars point, vitarit link trekking or fil str ancripshan jise encripting fil system ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The USN Journal is a feature of system management that records all files, streams, and directories, as well as their various features and security settings
 yah NTFS kii ek mahatvapurn kaaryakshmata he jo yah sunishchit karne ke liye he ki iskaa aantarik jatil data tathaa suchi system ke krash hone kii sthiti main yathaavat bane rahenge tathaa volum ko dobaaraa thik karne ke dauraan in mahatvapurn data sanrachanaon ko phir se uplabdh karaayenge
 In later versions of Windows, USN Journal has since attempted to extend such a search to other parts of the NTFS file system used in other implementations, such as VSS shadow copy of the system file with copy-on-write cementics, Or implementation of transactional NTFS and distributed file systems
 mul rup se Windows NT main POSIX upatantr main shaamil hone vaale hard link diarectory jankshan ke samaan hai, lekin diarectory ke bajaae filon ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Hard links can only be applied to files of the same volume because the file's MFT record has an additional filename record attached to it
 laghu fil naam bhi atirikt fil naam record kii tarah kriyanvit hote hai jinaki alag se diarectory pravishtiyaan nahin hai
 The optional data stream combines more than one data stream with a filename, using the filename format - "filename: streamname"
 vaikalpik vishay Windows Explorer main soochibaddh nahin hai or unka saise fil ke saise main shaamil nahin he
 When a file that is uploaded from an email or website is copied to a USB drive formatted by network share or FAT, only the main stream of that file is preserved
 parinamswarup, mahatvapurn data ke liye vaikalpik stream kaa prayog samasya paidaa kar saktaa he
 Malware uses alternate data streams to hide its code; Some malware scanners and other specialized tools now check data in alternate streams
 bahari citon se downlod kii gayi filon ko chinhit karne ke liye bahut chote ADS Internet Explorer main jode jate hai: unhen sthaneey rup se chalaanaa asurakshit ho saktaa he or sthaneey system ko unhen kholane se pehle yuzar se pushti kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 This ADS is removed in the MFT entry for downloaded files when the user indicates that they no longer need the confirmation dialog
 kuch media ke diggajon ne bhi media filon kii prabhavi data saamagree ko sanshodhit kiye bagaiyr, sangrah ko vyavasthit karne ke liye, custom metadata kaa media filon main sangrahan ke liye ADS kaa prayog kiya he 
 in metadata ko Windows Explorer main atirikt jaankaree kollam ke rup main ek panjikrut Windows Shell ekstansion kii sahaayta se dikhaaya ja saktaa he, jo unhen unhen pars kar sakate hai
 But most media giants use their own separate database for storing these information instead of ADS
 spars filein aisi filein hai jinamein spars data set hota he tathaa data zyaadaatar shunya se bhare hote hai
 Database programs sometimes use sparse files
 is kaaran, Microsoft ne spars filon ke kushal sangrahan ke liye ek program ko khaali data kshetron ko nirdisht karne kii anumati di he
 a program reads the sparse file in a normal way and the file system calculates what data should be returned at file offset
 compress filon ke saath, kota seemaa ke nirdhaaran ke samay spars filon ke vaastavik saise kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa jaataa
 NTFS can compress files using a version of the LZ77 algorithm
 haalanki compress filon ko padhane-likhane kii pahunch paardarshee he, Microsoft sarwar system tathaa / yaa roming profile ke saath network share par compressant kii anushansa nahin karata kyonki yah procesar par baari boj daalata he
 The Volume Shadow Copy service copies historical versions of files and folders on the NTFS volume by creating shadow copies of old, newly overwritten data
 When the user wants to get the earlier version back, the old data is returned on the new files
 yah byaap program ko fil system dwaara prayukt kii ja raheen filon ke sangrahan kii bhi anumati detaa he
 On heavily loaded systems, Microsoft recommends keeping shadow copy on a separate disk
 system ke lagaataar krash hone ke maamalon main, VSS local transection ko chinhit karne ke liye USN jarnal kaa prayog karata he or yah sunishchit karata he ki NTFS volum dobaaraa daalane tathaa system ko dobaaraa chaalu karne ke pashchaat filon ke patibaddh parivartan prabhaavshaalee dhang se dobaaraa praapt ho jaaen athwa sanshodhit fil band hone ke kaaran nae sanskaran ke record na hone kii sthiti main surakshit dhang se purana sanskaran lod ho jaae
 haalanki, ye VSS shadow transection cordinator ke bina kai sari filon yaa volum par samanvay nahin kar rahe hai
 They can only be used to ensure that older versions remain available during backup so that continuous images of the system can be obtained through those backups
 Windows Vista main, program ke dwaara filon main hone vaale samuhik parivartanon ko transection main parivartit karne ke liye transectional NTFS kaa prayog kar sakate hai
 The transaction guarantees that all changes will happen or not and it also guarantees that no changes will happen outside the transaction without commitment
 yah volum shadow copy main prayukt hone vaali takneekein prayukt karata he taaki overrite kiya gaya data surakshit dhang se vaapis laayaa ja sake, tathaa bina patibaddhta vaali athwa patibaddh ho chuki kintu puri tarah kriyanvit na hone vaali transection ko USF jarnal log chinhit kar le 
 However, in transactional enabled file systems, unless the transaction is committed, it can be used temporarily for any type of partition, instead of system files that are permanently marked by copy-on-write ceramics And are completely modified by their local transactions
 prabhaavshaalee dhang se data vaapis lene tathaa pratiyogiyon dwaara fil system main sambhavit vikhandan se bachane ke liye copy-on-rhite takanic main sanshodhan kiya gaya he
 The old data is not immediately overwritten but remains in place, in which case only the new untransformed data is placed in the temporary shadow and the normal VSS copy-on-write is used after the author finally completes the transaction
 iske atirikt, yah jaruri nahin he ki naye data ke liye asthaayee shadow, jo keval apatibaddh data vaali pratibhaagi prakriyaaon dwaara dekhi ja sakati he tunrat discs par likhi jaae apitu memory main rakhi ja sakati he or jarurat padane par badali ja sakati he
 NTFS transactions are not limited to only local NTFS volumes, but also include transactional data and processes from other locations such as data stored in other volumes, local registry, SQL database, system service or remote service in the current case
 ye transection kisi vishisht seva kaa prayog kar rahe sabhi pratibhaagiyon dwaara network ke madhyam se samanvit hoti he jiskaa naam distributed transection cordinator he jo yah sunishchit karti he sabhi pratibhaagi ek jaisi sthiti main kaam karenge, tathaa kisi pratibhaagi dwaara pushti kiye jane par badlaavon ko sab tak pahunchaaya jaayegaa udhaaharan ke liye transectional NTFS network main vitarit fil system kii anumati detaa he jisamen unki sthaneey online yaa ofline memory bhi shaamil he
 EFS encodes any file or folder on the NTFS volume in a powerful and transparent manner
 EFS, EFS seva, Microsoft ke cryptoapi or EFS File System Run- Time Library ke saath ikaithe kaam karata he
 EFS encodes a file with a symmetric key that is used that takes less time to encode or decode large amounts of data than an asymmetric key
 cemetric kunjee, jiskaa prayog fil ko kutabaddh karne main kiya gaya tha, ko ek yuzar, jisane fil ko kutabaddh kiya tha, dwaara public kunjee kii sahaayta se kutabaddh kiya jaataa he or is kutabaddh data ko kutabaddh fil kii vaikalpik data stream main rakhaa jaataa he
 To decode a file, the file system uses the user's private key to decode the asymmetric key that is stored in the file header
 iske pashchaat yah fil ko dicode karne ke liye cemetric kunjee kaa prayog karata he
 Because it is done at the file system level, it is transparent to the user
 iske alaava, yuzar dwaara apni kunjee ko khone kii sthiti main, EFS system main atirikt dicode kunjiyon kii vyavastha kii gayi he taaki jarurat padane par recovery agent fil kaa prayog kar saken
 NTFS dwaara pradaan kii gayi kutabaddh tathaa sampeedan suvidhaayen paraspar anokhi hai
 NTFS can be used as a separate tool for one or the other
 EFS kii suvidha Windows ke basic, home tathaa media centre sanskaran main uplabdh nahin he tathaa Windows ke profeshnal, ultimate tathaa sarwar sanskaran ke lod karne ke pashchaat yaa Windows domen main interpries dwaara pradutt tul kaa prayog karke actevet kii jaani chahie
 Disk quota was introduced in NTFS v3
 ye computer ke administrator ko Windows kaa sanskaran chalaane kii anumati detaa he jis se NTFS kii sahaayta se discs sthaan banaaya ja saktaa he jiskaa upyog yuzar baad main kar saktaa he
 It also helps the administrator to know how much disk space each user is using
 administrator yuzar dwaara prayog kiye jane vaale discs sthaan kaa ek nishchit str nirdhaarit kar saktaa he jiske pashchaat ek chetavanee milti he or sthaan kii sarvocch sthiti tak pahunchne ke pashchaat yuzar ko manaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Disk quota does not include NTFS in its activity despite transparent file compression being enabled
 Programs that require free disk space to run can allow the user to see the quota set
 discs kota kii suvidha Windows ke basic, home tathaa media centre sanskaran main uplabdh nahin he tathaa Windows ke profeshnal, ultimate tathaa sarwar sanskaran ke lod karne ke pashchaat yaa Windows domen main interpries dwaara pradutt tul kaa prayog karke actevet kii jaani chahie
 This feature was introduced in NTFS v3
 inkaa upyog ek fil yaa diarectory kii yuzar spes visheshta main ripars tag ko jod kar kiya jaataa he
 When the Object Manager parses the file system name lookup and encounters a reparse attribute, it knows how to reparse the name lookup and sends the user-controlled reparse data to each file system filter driver loaded in Windows 2000
 is
 prayek filter dryver ripars data kii jaanch yah dekhne ke liye karata he ki yah us ripars point se judaa hua he ki nahin or aisa hone kii sthiti main yah fil system kol ko avaruddh karata he tathaa apni vishesh kaaryashiltaa ko kriyanvit karata he
 The reparse point is used to implement volume mount points, directory junctions, storage management, structural storage and symbolic links
 Unix mount point kii tarah he, jahaan ek fil system kaa mul ek diarectory se judaa hua he
 In NTFS, it allows an additional file system to grow without any drive letter
 ek baar volum ke duusare volum kii maujuuda diarectory ke upar copy hone kii sthiti main us diarectory kii pichhali saamagree adrishy ho jaati he mount kiye gayi volum kii root diarectory se badal jaati he
 The volume to be mounted may still have a self-declared drive letter
 fil system kabhi bhi volum ko ek duusare ke upar mount karne kii anumati nahin dete
 volum mount point ko lagaataar yaa nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 Mounted volumes may use other file systems than NTFS, they may be directories shared by the remote with their own security system and remapping control rights according to the remote file system policy
 volum mount point kii tarah he, haalaanki diarectory jankshan fil system main duusare volum ke bajaae duusari diarectory kaa sandarbh dete hai
 For example, the directory C: \ exampledir, a directory junction attribute with a link to D: \ linkeddir, will automatically refer to the directory D: \ linkeddir when used by the user mode application
 yah kriyanvan dharnatmak rup se Unix kii diarectory link ke samaan he, sivaay iske ki NTFS main lakshya hameshaa duusari diarectory hogi tathaa hard link ke lakshan hoge 
 The directory connects continuously and resolves to the server because they share the same security zone as the local system or domain to which the parent volume is mounted, and arrange their content security according to the contents of the target directory, although at different junctions There may be security
 ek diarectory jankshan kaa link hatane par lakshya diarectory kii filein nasht nahin hotin
 Directory junctions are soft links, and serve as a limited form of symbolic links, but this is a customized version that speeds up the process of reparse points during execution and runs at a lower cost than the new NTFS symbolic links and allows it to run on servers
 Can be solved on
 simbolic links Windows Vista main shuru kiye gaye the
 Symbolic links are resolved at the client end
 isliye, jab ek simbolic link sanjha kiya jaataa he, to lakshya graahak ke pahunch pratibandhon ke adheen he, na ki sarwar ke
 Symbolic links can be created in files or directories, but the meaning of the link must be provided with the link created
 lekin simbolic link banane ke dauraan lakshya kaa astitv main hona yaa uplabdh hona aavashyak nahin he
 When the symbolic link is checked and the target is checked for availability, NTFS will also check if its type is correct
 In case the target type is wrong, it will not be found that the error will be displayed
 ye remote host par share kii gayi diarectory athwa us diarectory kii filon yaa sab diarectory kii ore sanket kar sakate hai
 Their goal is not exactly determined at boot, but is temporarily available when opened with openfile or createfileapi
 NTFS volum par unki paribhaasha nirantar he jahaan ve utpann hote hai
 
 bahut si diarectriyon main vibhinn kintu ek jaisi filein ho sakati hai, in filon main se kuch main samaan saamagree ho sakati hai
 Single phase storage allows merging of similar files into one file and creating a merged file reference
 SIS main ek fil system filter hota he jo filon kii pratilipiyon, sanshodhano tathaa vilyon kaa prabandhan karata he tathaa ek yuzar spes seva jo un filon ko dhundti he jo samaan hai, tathaa jinka vilay karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 SIS was designed primarily for remote installation servers because they have too many installation images that may contain many similar files
 SIS inhen ikattha karata he kintu hard link ke udhaaharan ke vipareet har fil alag alag rahati he, fil kii kisi ek prati main parivartan karne se baaki filon par parivartan kaa asar nahin hota
 This is similar to the copy-on-write technique in which memory is not completely copied until a copy is modified
 shakhaakrit sangrahan prabandhan kam kharchili sangrahan pranali main un filon ko sthanantarit karne kaa ek saadhan he jo kuch avadhi se prayukt nahin ho rahi hai
 When the file is next opened, the reparse point of the file determines its need and gets it from storage
 NSS ek activex dastauez sangrahan takanic thi jise Microsoft dwaara roak diya gaya tha
 This allowed activex documents to be stored in the same multi-stream format that activex uses internally
 ek NSS fil system filter ko lod kiya gaya or iskaa prayog multiple stream ko paardarshee dhang se program ko bhejne ke liye kiya gaya tathaa jab fil ko non-ntfs formated discs volum par bheja gaya to isane single stream ke saath multiple stream ko bhi sthanantarit kar diya
 No details were released for its implementation, making it difficult for third-party vendors to provide tools to handle NTFS
 NTFS ko padhane or likhane kii kshamta NTFS-3 ji dryver dwaara pradaan kii gai he
 It is mostly involved in Linux distribution
 anya puraane or zyaadaatar keval padhane ke samaadhaan bhi maujuud hai: Note that all three userspace drivers, namely ntfsmount, NTFS-3G and Captive NTFS, are built into userspace on the file system, which is a Linux module tasked with bridging the userspace and saving Kernel code and retrieving data has gone
 uparokt bataaye gaye lagbhag sabhi driver khule strot hai
 Due to the complexity of ntfs's internal structures, both internal-2
6
14 Kernel drivers and fuse drivers do not allow changes to the volume that they perceive to be unsafe to avoid malfunction
 mike OS x v10

 NTL-3G licensed by the GPL also works on Mac OS x via FUSE and allows read and write access to NTFS partitions
 mike OS x ke liye ek saath padhane / likhane kaa adhikaar praapt karne kaa ekmaatr upaay "mike OS x ke liye paragon NTFS" he

 jabaki alag NTFS sanskarnon ke adhikansh bhaag puri tarah se aage or peeche jane main sakshamhain, Microsoft Windows ke puraane sanskarnon main nae NTFS sanskarnon par kuch takneekee kaarnon se pareshaaniyaan hai
 This affects dual booting and external portable hard drives
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek oparating system, jo sahaayak nahin he, par NTFS partishan par pichhlaa sanskaran praapt karne kii koshish karne ke parinamswaroop pichley sanskaran kii saamagree kho jaayegi
 opensolaris, ecomstation, kolibrios, and freebsd offer a read-only NTFS Sport
 Another third tool, beos, which was based on NTFS-3G, allows read and write access to NTFS
 NTFS-3 g bhi FUSE ke madhyam se Linux ke alaava mike OS X, freebsd, netbsd, Solaris or Haiku par kaam karti he
 a free private use read / write MS-DOS driver "NTFS4DOS" also exists
 Microsoft vartmaan main ek upkaran pradaan karata he jo HPFS,FAT16 Windows 2000 or ucch sanskaran or FAT32 ko NTFS main badal detaa he, lekin iskaa koi doosraa tarika nahin he
 Various third-party tools are also capable of secure NTFS partition resizing
 Microsoft ne Windows Vista main partishan ko sicodne tathaa bada karne kii kshamta jodi he, lekin yah kshamta simit he kyonki yah pej fil fregments yaa sthanantarit na hone vaali fil ko nahin hataayega, atah partishan ko sicodne kii kshamta simit he
 Using a third tool without rebooting or defragmenting a page file can worsen the situation if the page file is not a deleting file
 aitihaasik kaarnon se, Windows ke sanskaran joki NTFS kaa samarthan nahin karte, sabhi aantarik rup se samay ko sthaneey samay kshetra ke rup main rakhte hai or NTFS ke alaava baaki fil system bhi aisa hi karte hai jinhen Windows kaa vartmaan sanskaran sahaayta kar rahaa he
 However, Windows NT and subsequent versions keep internal time stamps as UTC and make appropriate changes for performance
 isliye, UTC main NTFS time stamps hai
 This means that when files are copied or moved between NTFS and non-ntfs partitions, the OS needs to change time stamps on the fly
 lekin agar kuch filein jab de-lite seaving time ke antargat sthanantarit kii jaati hai or agar kuch filein maanak samay ke antargat sthanantarit kii jaati hai to roopantaran ke dauraan visangatiyaan ho sakati hai
 As a result, after a day when the local time zone changes, users may find that some files have a 1-hour fault in their time stamps
 dsti ko lagu karne main uttari or dakshini golardhon ke bich matbhed ke chalate, kisi bhi 12 maheene main ek sambhavit timestamp main 4 ghante tak kii truti ho sakati he
 In NTFS, all file data - filename, creation date, control permission and content - is stored as metadata in the master file table
 is suvidha ne Windows NT fil pranali ke vikaas ke dauraan fil system suvidhaon ko aasaani se jodna sambhav banaaya
 - An interesting example is adding fields for indexing by Active Directory software
 NTFS naam ankoding ke liye 16-bit vailu ke kisi bhi kram ko anumati detaa he 
 iskaa matlab yah he UTF-16 code points kaa samarthan kiya jaataa he lekin fil system yah jaanch nahin karata ki kram vaid UTF-16 he 
 Internally, the NTFS file system uses a b + tree to index data
 haalanki yah lagu karne main kathin he, zyaadaatar maamalon main yah fil ko tezi se khojataa he
 a file system journal guarantees the integrity of file system metadata but not the contents of individual files
 system jo NTFS kaa upyog karte hai unhen FAT fil system kii tulana main vishwasaneey mana jaataa he
 The master file table holds information on each file, directory, and NTFS volume as the metadata of the metafile
 isamen fil naam, sthaan, saise or anumati bhi shaamil he
 Its structure supports algorithms, which minimize disk fragmentation
 ek diarectory pravishti main ek fil naam or "fil ID" hota he jo master fil talika main fil kii record sankhya ko pradarshit karata he
 The file ID count is reused to locate old references
 haalanki yah fil-11 ke W_FID se atyadhik miltaa he, anya NTFS sanrachanaayen moulik rup se alag dikhti hai
 NTFS consists of several files that define and organize the file system
 sabhi maamalon main, ye filein kisi bhi anya yuzar filon kii tarah bani hoti hai, lekin fil system ke graahakon kii isamen pratyaksh ruchi nahin hoti
ye meta filein, filon ko paribhaashit karti hai, fil system data kii mahatvapurn filon kaa byaap rakhti hai, tathaa bafer fil system main parivartan, mukt sthaan aabantan prabandhan,bios kii apekshaaon ko puraa karnaa, kharaab aavanton ikaayiyon ko khojna, suraksha tathaa discs sthaan upyog kii jaankaree ko sangrahan karne kaa kaary karti hai
 All content is in an anonymous data stream, unless indicated elsewhere
 in meta filon ko vishesh rup se Windows dwaara prayukt kiya jaataa he or inhen sidhe dekh paanaa mushkil he: dekhne ke liye vishesh tuls kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 For each file described in an MFT record, there is a repository of stream descriptors, which are packed together into records of an indefinite length, each MTF record has a fixed 1KB size of padding to fill, and it streams effectively with the file
 Let's describe
 prayek stream kaa ek single prakaar yaa file creat API kol program dwaara niyantrit kii jaati he), ek vaikalpik single stream naam tathaa us stream ke saath judaa vaikalpik data
 NTFS ke liye, fil kaa maanak data, yaa diarectory ke liye index data usee dhang se niyantrit hote hai jaise duusari data stream yaa maanak atribute ke liye kiye jate hai
 They are one of the attributes stored in only one or several attribute lists
 sangrahan kii kshamta badhaane tathaa chota data ke saath judy stream ke i / o kharche kam karne ke liye, NTFS MTF pravishti ke dwaara cluster soochibaddh karne ke bajaae stream discriptor main data daalane ko praathamikta detaa he
 
 In this case the stream descriptor will not store the data directly but will store it on an allocation map that will point to the data stored elsewhere on the volume
 jab stream data ko stream discriptor se sidhe praapt kiya ja saktaa he, to ise computer forencix kaaryakartaaon dwaara "racident data" kaha jaataa he
 The amount of data is highly dependent on file characteristics, but 700-800 bytes of single file files with short filenames and no acls are common
 NTFS fil system dryver kabhi kabhi stream ripogitry main non-racident stream ko daalane kaa prayaas karata he tathaa non-racident ripogitry main sangrahit stream discriptor ko MFT record kii stream ripogitry main daalane kaa bhi prayaas karata he
 These efforts are dependent on the order and size of the order based on priority and priority
 chunki racident filein cluster par kabza nahin karatin, isliye ek NTFS volum par cluster se zyada fil naamon kaa hona sambhav he
 For example, 4kib of an 80 GB partition can have 19,543,064 clusters
 system filon ko ghataane ke pashchaat 19,526,158 cluster filon tathaa soochiyon ke liye khaali hai
 Because a cluster contains 4 MFT records, this volume can theoretically handle approximately 4 × 19,526,158 = 78,104,632 resident files

 As soon as he passed, he reached the position of taking the position of lecturer in Prayag University, as well as taking over the responsibility of the city proceedings of Prayag
 1946 main prayag vibhaag ke kaarywah, 1948 main jail-yatra, 1949 main do teen vibhaagon ko milakar sambhag kaarywah, 1952 main praant kaarywah or 1954 main bhaurav devaras ke praant chhodane ke baad unki jagah puure praant kaa daayitv sanbhaalane lage
 On returning to Bhaurao in 1961, he became his associate again as co-pracharak by returning the responsibility of the preacher
 bhaurav ke kaaryakshetra kaa vistaar hua to pun: 1962 se 1965 tak uttar pradesh ke praant prachaarak, 1966 se 1974 tak sah kshetra-prachaarak va kshetra-prachaarak kaa daayitv sanbhaala
 From 1975 to 1977, during the Emergency, he stood the movement for the return of democracy by going underground
 1977 main sah-sarkarywah bane to 1978 march main madhavrao mule kaa sar-kaarywah kaa daayitv bhi unhen hi diya gaya
 By discharging this responsibility from 1978 to 1987, in 1987, he became his associate as a co-governmenter by giving this responsibility to Hove Seshadri
 1994 main tatkaaleen sarasanghachaalak bala sahab devaras ne apane girte swasthya ke kaaran jab apana uttaradhikari khojna shuru kiya to sabaki nigahen rajju bhaiya par thahar gayin or 11 march 1994 ko bala sahib ne sarasanghachaalak kaa sheershasth daayitv swayamev unhen saunp diya
 This was an unusual event in the history of the Union
 prachaar madhyamon or sangh ke aalochakon kii aankhe is drishy ko dekhakar fatty kii fatty rah gayin
 He could not believe that any non-maharashtrian Abraham of North India could reach the pinnacle of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on which he has been imposing the image of the monopoly of Maharashtrian Brahmins till now - that too unanimously
 rajju bhaiya kaa sharir us samay rogagrast or shithil tha kintu unhone praan-pan se saunpe gayi daayitv ko nibhaane kaa ji-tod prayaas kiya
 But how long could one be taken away from his body which was severely broken by non-working and social thinking
 atev san 1999 main hi unhone us daayitv kaa bhaar kisi kam umr ke vyakti ko saunpane kaa man bana liya
 And finally, after waiting for a year, respecting the earnest request of his colleagues, in March 2000, he handed over this responsibility to Sudarshanji and presented a model to the Union for voluntary retirement
 rajju bhaiya kii 60 varsh lambi sangh-yatra keval is drushti se hi asaamaanya nahin he ki kis prakaar ve ek ke baad doosraa bada daayitv safaltaapurvak nibhaate rahe apitu is drushti se bhi he ki 1943 se 1966 tak ve prayag vishvavidhyalay main adhyaapan kaary ke saath-saath ek purnakalik prachaarak kii bhanti yatra-tatra-sarvatra ghoomte hue samast dayitvon kaa nirvaah karte rahe
 In order to increase their capacity for union work, they did not depend on three years of traditional training in union education class
 pratham varsh kaa prashikshan unhone 1947 main tab praapt kiya jab ve prayag ke nagar kaarywah kii sthiti main pahunch chuke the, dwitiya varsh unhone 1954 main bareli ke sangh-shiksha-varg main us samay kiya jab bhaurav devaras unhen samooche praant kaa daayitv saunpkar baahar jane kii taiyaari kar chuke the
 He did the third year in 1957 when he was handling the responsibility of a big province like Uttar Pradesh
 is baat se spasht he ki unhone teen varsh ke prashikshan kii aupchaarikta kaa nirvaah sangh ke anya swayamsevakon ke sammukh yogya udhaaharan prastut karne ke liye kiya apane liye yogyata arjeet karne ke liye nahin
 Even while teaching in Prayag University, he was busy campaigning in union work
 aupchaarik taur par unhen prachaarak 1958 main ghoshit kiya gaya par sachaai yah he ki unhone kaarywah pad ko prachaarak kii bhoomika swayan pradaan kar di
 Rajju Bhaiya was one of the most popular and successful professors of Prayag University due to his very simple and interesting teaching style and affection towards his disciples, besides possessing unusual authority on esoteric subjects like physics
 varishthata or yogyata ke kaaran unhen kai varshon tak vibhaag ke adhyaksh-pad kaa daayitv bhi professor ke saath-saath sanbhaalanaa padaa
 But in spite of all this, they continued to fulfill their duties in the union work
 reader yaa professor banane kii koi kaamana unke man main kabhi nahin jaagi
 The days when he was asked to apply for the post of Reader of Physics Department in Prayag University, he did not give the application
 sahyogiyon ne poocha ki rajju bhaiya! aapane aisa kyon kiya? to unhone bade sahaj dhang se uttar diya- "are meraa jivan-kaary to sangh-kaary he, vishvavidhyalay kii professori nahin
 Right now i take classes four days a week, three days i visit for union work
 kabhi-kabhi bahut koshish karne par bhi vishvavidhyalay samay par nahin pahunch paata
 Right now all the teachers of the department support me, but if i become a candidate on the post of reader, then they will start thinking of me as their competitor
 isliye kyon is pachade main fasana
 "rajju Bhaiya's entire life is a witness to the fact that he has never had any aspiration or desire for the post
 vishvavidhyalay main adhyaaapak rah kar bhi unhone apane liye dhanarjan nahin kiya
 They used to spend every pie of their salary on union work
 sampann parivaar main janm lene, public skulon main shiksha paane, sangeet or cricket jaise khelon main ruchi hone ke baad bhi ve apane upar kam se kam kharch karte the
 He was a rare example of austerity
 varsh ke ant main apane vetan main se jo kuch bachataa use guru-dakshina ke rup main samaaj ko arpit kar dete the
 Once Rashtradham Prakashan got stuck in the economic crisis, he urged his father to repay Rashtradharma Prakashan by giving his share money
 yah thi unki sarvatyagi sannyast vritti kii abhivyakti! Rajju Bhaiya was dear to everyone due to selfless affection and unselfish work
 sangh ke bheetar bhi or baahar bhi
 He also gained the trust and affection of politicians like Purshottam Das Tandon and Lal Bahadur Shastri as well as saints like Prabhudatta Brahmachari
 bahut samvedansheel ant:karan ke saath-saath rajju bhaiya ghor yathartwaadee bhi the
 He used to say anything unacceptable to anyone and it was difficult to avoid his talk
 apatkaal ke baad janata party kii sarkaar main jab nanaaji deshmukh ko udyog mantri kaa pad dena nishchit ho gaya to rajju bhaiya ne unase kaha ki nanaaji agar aap, atalji or adwaniji - teenon sarkaar main chale jaayenge to baahar rahakar sanghathan ko koun sanbhaalega? nanaaji ne unki ichha kaa aadar karte hue turant mantripad thukraa diya or janata party kaa mahasachiv bananaa sweekaar kiya
 Whether it is Atalji, or Advaniji; Be it Ashokji Sinhala, or Dattopant Thengdiji - every top leader respected Rajju Bhaiya's talk; Because there was no sense of selfishness, notoriety or factionalism behind him
 is drushti se dekhen to rajju bhaiya sachmuch sangh-parivaar ke na keval bodhi-vriksh apitu sabko jodne vaali kadi the, naitik shakti or prabhaav kaa strot the
 With his departure, not only the Sangh but an era has come to an end in the public life of India
 rajju bhaiya keval haad-maans kaa sharir nahin the
 He was a true figure of self-determination, determination and idyllic idealism
 isliye rajju bhaiya sabhi ke ant:karan main sadaiv jivit rahenge

 The present form of culture is the result of the long-term practices of a society
 ‘samskruti’ shabd sanskrit bhashaa kii dhaatu ‘kri’ se bana he
 Three words are formed from this metal, 'nature', 'culture' and 'perversion'

 In English, the word 'culture' is used for culture which is derived from the Latin language 'cult or cultus', which means to cultivate, develop or refine and worship
 sankshep main, kisi vastu ko yahan tak sanskaarit or parishkrut karnaa ki iskaa antim utpaada hamaari prashansa or sammaan praapt kar sake

 Physical progress can erase the hunger of the body, but in spite of this the mind and soul remain unquenchable
 inhen santusht karne ke liye manushya apana jo vikaas or unnati karata he, use samskruti kehete hai

 These mainly include religion, philosophy, all the knowledge-sciences and arts, social and political institutions and practices
 samskruti jivan kii vidhi he
 The food we eat, the clothes we wear, the language we speak and the God we worship are all civilizations; However, they also inform culture
 saral shabdon me ham kah sakate hai ki samskruti us vidhi kaa pratik he jiske aadhaar par ham sochate hai; or kaary karte hai
 It also includes the intangible / non-abstract expressions and thoughts that we get in succession as members of a family and society
 ek saamaajik varg ke sadsy ke rup main maanvon kii sabhi uplabdhiyaan uski samskruti se prerit kahi ja sakati hai
 Art, music, literature, architecture, architecture, philosophy, religion and science are all manifest aspects of culture
 tathaapi samskruti main ritirivaaj, paramparaayen, parv, jeene ke tareeke, or jivan ke vibhinn pakshon par vyakti vishesh kaa apana drushtikon bhi sammilit hai
 In this way culture relates to the human-born mental environment in which all non-material products are supplied from one generation to the next
 samaaj-vaigyanikon main ek saamaanya sahmati he ki samskruti main manushyon dwaara praapt sabhi aantarik or bahya vyavhaaron ke tareeke samahit hai
 They can also be transferred by markings; Which includes specific achievements of human groups
 inhen shilpaklakritiyon dwaara moort rup pradaan kiya jaataa he
 In fact, the basic focus of culture lies in the subtle ideas that have historically been understood in a group, along with the values attached to them
 samskruti kisi samaaj ke ve sookshm sanskaar hai, jinke madhyam se log paraspar sampreshan karte hai, vichaar karte hai or jivan ke vishay main apni abhivrittiyon or gyaan ko disha dete hai
 Culture is an expression of our innermost nature in our way of living and thinking
 yah hamaare sahitya main, dharmik kaaryon main, manoranjan or anand praapt karne ke tareekon main bhi dekhi ja sakati hai
 There are two different sub-departments of culture - physical and non-physical
 bhautik samskruti un vishyon se judi he jo hamaari sabhyataa kehete hai, or hamaare jivan ke bhautik pakshon se sambaddh hote hai, jaise hamaari veshbhusha, bhojan, gharelu saamaan aadi
 Non-material culture is related to thoughts, ideals, feelings and beliefs
 samskruti ek samaaj se duusare samaaj tathaa ek desh se duusare desh main badalati rahati he
 Its development is based on historical and knowledge-related process and progress in a social or national context
 udhaaharan ke liye, hamaare abhivadan kii vidhiyon main, hamaare vastron main, khaane kii aadaton main, paariwarik sambandhon main, saamaajik or dharmik ritirivaajon or manyataon main paricham se bhinnata he
 To be fair, the people of any country are recognized by their unique cultural traditions
 samskruti or sabhyataa donon shabd praayah paryaay ke rup main prayukt kar diye jate hai
 Yet both have fundamental differences; And both have different meanings
 samskruti kaa sambandh vyakti or samaaj main nihit sanskaron se he; or uskaa nivas uske maanas main hota he
 On the other hand, the field of civilization is from the external nature of the individual and society
 'sabhy' kaa shabdic arth he, 'jo sabha main sammilit hone yogya ho'
 Therefore, civilization shapes such a civilized person and the collective form of society
 sabhyataa ko angreji main 'civillizeshan' kehete he; or culture se uskaa antar spasht hi he
 There is the same distinction between culture and civilization
 prarambh main manushya aandhi-pani, sardi-garmi sab kuch sahataa hua jangalon main rahata tha, shaniah-shaniah usne in prakritik vipadaaon se apni raksha ke liye pehle gufaaon or phir kramshah lakdi, eent yaa pathar ke makaanon kii sharan lee
 Now he has started building skyscrapers of iron and cement
 pracheen kaal main yatayaat kaa saadhan sirf maanav ke do pair hi the
 Then he took shelter of horses, camels, elephants, chariots and Bahli
 ab motor or railgadee ke dwaara thode samay main bahut lambe faasale tay karata he, hawaii jahaaj dwaara akaash main bhi udne laga he
 Earlier man used to take his sustenance from the root, root and fruit of the forest and the game

 Earlier he used to do all his work with physical strength
 peeche usne pashuon ko paaltu banaakar or sadhakar unki shakti kaa hal, gaadi aadi main upyog karnaa siikhaa
 In the end, he subdued the physical powers of air, water, vapor, electricity and molecules and made such machines, which transformed his physical life
 manushya kii yah sari pragati sabhyataa kehalaati he
 'civilization' means better ways of living and sometimes even bowing to nature to fulfill its needs

 Thus some classes consider themselves more civilized, and others look down upon them
 kuch virgon kii is manovriti ne kai baar sangharshon ko bhi janm diya he jinka parinaam manushya ke vinaashkari vidhwans ke rup main hua he
 On the contrary, culture is associated with inner cognition, which involves purity of mind and heart
 isamen kala, vigyaan, sangeet or nrity or maanav jivan kii ucchtar uplabdhiyaan sammihit hai jinhen 'saanskrithik gatividhiyaan' kaha jaataa he
 a person who is poor, wearing cheap clothes can be called rude but he can also be called the most cultured person
 ek vyakti jiske paas bahut dhan he vah sabhy to ho saktaa he par aavashyak nahin ki vah susanskrit bhi ho
 Therefore, when we think about culture, we should understand that it is different from civilization
 samskruti maanav ke antarman kaa ucchtam str he
 Human beings are not just physical
 ve teen staron par jite hai or vyavhaar karte hai - bhautik, maansik or aadhyatmik
 While progressively better ways of living socially and politically and better use of the surrounding nature can be called 'civilization', but it is not enough to be cultured
 jab ek vyakti kii buddhi or intaraatma ke gahan staron kii abhivyakti hoti he tab ham use ‘sanskrit’ kah sakate hai
 Cultural development is a historical process
 hamaare purvajon ne bahut si baaten apane purakhon se sikhi he
 Over time, he increased that with his experiences
 jo anaavashyak tha, usko unhone chhod diya
 We also learned a lot from our ancestors
 jaise-jaise samay bitta he, ham unamem nae vichaar, nai bhavanaayen jodate chale jate hai or isi prakaar jo ham upyogi nahin samajhate use chhodte jate hai
 In this way, the culture goes hand in hand from one generation to the next
 jo samskruti ham apane purvajon se praapt karte hai use saanskrithik viraasat kehete hai
 This legacy exists on many levels
 maanavtaa ne sampoorn rup main jis samskruti ko viraasat ke rup main apanaaya use 'maanavtaa kii viraasat' kehete hai
 a nation also inherits culture as heritage called 'national Cultural Heritage'
 saanskrithik viraasat main ve sabhi paksh yaa mulya sammilit hai jo manushyon ko peedi dar peedi apane purvajon se praapt hue hai
 Those values are worshiped, preserved and unceasingly preserved and generations to be proud of
 viraasat ke sanpratyay ko spasht karne ke liye kuch udhaaharan sahaayak siddh honge
 Taj Mahal, Swami Narayan Temple, Agra's Red Fort, Qutub Minar of Delhi, Mysore Palace, Jain Temple of Dilwade, Dargah of nizamuddin-auliya, Golden Temple of Amritsar
 dilli kaa sheeshganj gurudwara, sanchi stupa, goa main chrishchiyan carch, india get aadi hamaari viraasat ke mahatvapurn sthaan hai or ye kisi bhi prakaar sangrakshit kiye jane chahie
 Apart from these architectural works, buildings, artifacts, intellectual achievements, philosophy, texts of knowledge, scientific inventions and discoveries are also part of the heritage
 bhartiya sandarbh main ganit, khagol vidya or jyotish ke kshetra main boudhayan, aryabhatta or bhaskaracharya kaa yogadan, bhautikashastra ke kshetra main kanad or varahamihir kaa, rasayanashastra ke kshetra main nagarjun, aushadhi ke kshetra main sushrut or charak, yoga ke kshetra main patanjali hamaari bhartiya saanskrithik viraasat ke pragadh khajaane hai
 Culture is variable but our heritage is not variable
 bhartiya samskruti kii visheshtaayen Indian culture is the most ancient and rich culture in the world
 anya deshon kii samskritiyaan to samay kii dhara ke saath-saath nasht hoti rahi hai, kintu bharat kii samskruti aadi kaal se hi apane paramparaagat astitv ke saath ajar-amar bani hui he
 Its generosity and syncretic qualities have assimilated other cultures, but preserved the core of its existence
 tabhi to paashchaatya vidvan apane desh kii samskruti ko samajhane hetu bhartiya samskruti ko pehle samajhane kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 Characteristics of Culture The following are the salient features of Indian culture: pracheenta -bhartiya samskruti vishwa kii pracheenatam samskritiyon main se ek he
 The rock paintings found in Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh, excavations in the Narmada Valley and some other ethnographic and archaeological evidences have proved that the land of India etc
 has been the oldest work place of man
 sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa ke vivaranon se bhi pramanit hota he ki aaj se lagbhag paanch hazaar varsh pehle uttari bharat ke bahut bade bhaag main ek ucch koti kii samskruti kaa vikaas ho chukaa tha
 Similarly, the Indian culture reflected in the Vedas is not only a proof of antiquity, but it is also a great expression of Indian spirituality and thinking
 uplabdh pramaanon ke aadhaar par bhartiya samskruti se rome or unani samskruti ko pracheen tathaa misr, asyria evam babylonia jaisi samskritiyon ke samakaleen mana gaya he
 Continuity - An important feature of Indian culture is that even after thousands of years, this culture still survives in its original form, while the cultures of Egypt, Assyria, Greece and Rome have almost forgotten its original form
 bharat main nadiyon, vat, pipal jaise vrikshon, surya tathaa anya prakritik devi - devataaon kii puja archana kaa kram shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Recognition of deities, continuation of havan and methods of worship have remained unaffected till date
 vedon or vaidic dharm main karodon bharatiyon kii aasthaa or vishwaas aaj bhi utana hi he, jitna hazaron varsh purv tha
 The messages of the Gita and the Upanishads have been the basis of our inspiration and action for thousands of years
 kinchit parivartanon ke baavjood bhartiya samskruti ke aadharbhoot tattvon, jivan mulyon or vachan paddati main ek aisi nirantarataa rahi he, ki aaj bhi karodon bhartiya swayan ko un mulyon evam chintan pranali se judaa hua mahasoos karte hai or isse prerana praapt karte hai
 Resilience and tolerance - The tolerant nature of Indian culture has given it longevity and stability
 sansar kii kisi bhi samskruti main shaayad hi itani sahansheeltaa ho, jitani bhartiya samskruti main pai jaati he
 Indian Hindus do not worship or worship any deity, do or do worship or havan, etc
 Freedom was never imposed in the name of religion or culture
 isiilie pracheen bhartiya samskruti ke pratik hindu dharm ko dharm na kahkar kuch mulyon par aadhaarit ek jivan-paddati kii sangya di gai or hindu kaa abhipraay kisi dharm vishesh ke anuyaayi se na lagaakar bhartiya se lagaaya gaya
 Whenever a situation of inertia was created in this flexible form of Indian culture, some great man gave it dynamism and set its tolerance in a new aura
 is drushti se prachinkaal main buddha or mahavir ke dwaara, madhyakaal main shankaracharya, kabir, guru nanak or chaitanya mahaprabhu ke madhyam se tathaa aadhunik kaal main swami dayanand, swami vivekananda evam mahatma jyotiba phule ke dwaara kiye gaye prayaas is samskruti kii mahatvapurn dharohar ban gaye
 Receptivity - Due to the tolerance and generosity of Indian culture, there was an opportunity to develop a receptive tendency in it
 vastut: jis samskruti main loktantr evam sthayitv ke aadhaar vyapak hon, us samskruti main grahanshiltaa kii pravriti swaabhaavik rup se hi utpann ho jaati he
 In our culture, the original inhabitants here lost their identity by merging the process of coordination as well as people of the Shaka, Hun, Greeks and Kushans coming from outside
 bharat main islamic samskruti kaa aagaman bhi arabon, turkon or mughalon ke madhyam se hua
 Despite this, the Indian culture remained separate and the Indian culture did not hesitate to accept some good things from the newcomers
 thik yahi sthiti europea jatiyon ke aane tathaa british samrajya ke kaaran bharat main viksit hui isai samskruti par bhi lagu hoti he
 Although these cultures are now an integral part of Indian cultures, the nature of 'indian Islam' and 'indian Christian' cultures is somewhat different from other Islamic and Christian religions of the world
 is bhinnata kaa moolbhoot kaaran yah he ki bharat ke adhikansh musalmaan or isai mulat: bharat bhoomi ke hi nivasee hai
 Perhaps this is why there was no change in their social environment and cultural behavior and Indianness became their identity
 aadhyatmikta evam bhautikta kaa samanvay -bhartiya samskruti main ashram - vyavastha ke saath dharm, arth, kaam or moksh jaise chaar purushaarthon kaa vishisht sthaan rahaa he
 In fact, these efforts made an amazing coordination of materiality with spirituality in Indian culture
 hamaari samskruti main jivan ke aihik or parloukik donon pahaluon se dharm ko sambaddh kiya gaya tha
 Religion calls those principles, elements and life systems, so that mankind can make their cosmic life happy by developing divine powers and can experience individual peace after death
 sharir nashwar he, aatma amar he, yah amarta moksh se judi hui he or yah moksh paane ke liye arth or kaam ke purusharth karnaa bhi jaruri he
 Thus, in Indian culture, religion and salvation are interrelated with the spiritual message and the material imperative of meaning and work
 aadhyatmikta or bhautikta ke is samanvay main bhartiya samskruti kii vah vishisht avadharana parilakshith hoti he, jo manushya ke is lok or paralok ko sukhi banane ke liye bhartiya manishiyon ne nirmit kii thi
 Other cultures of the world do not worry about happy human life
 sahitya, sangeet or kala kii sampoorn vidhaon ke madhyam se bhi bhartiya samskruti ke is aadhyatmik evam bhautik samanvay ko saraltapurvak samajha ja saktaa he
 Unity in diversity - India is a country of diversities from a geographical point of view, yet its existence as a culturally entity has existed since ancient times
 is vishaal desh main uttar kaa parvatiy bhu-bhaag, jisaki seemaa purv main brahmaputra or pashchim main sindhu nadiyon tak vistrut he
 Along with this, the fertile agricultural land of Ganga, Yamuna, Sutlej, Vindhya and the plateau terrain covered by the forests of the south, Thar desert in the west, coastal region in the south and the picturesque area of assam and Meghalaya in the east
 is bhugolic vibhinnata ke atirikt is desh main aarthik or saamaajik bhinnata bhi paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 In fact, due to these differences, many cultural subsections have developed and flourished in India
 anek vibhinnataaon ke baavjood bhi bharat kii pruthak saanskrithik satta rahi he
 The Himalayas have been a symbol of the pride of the entire country, so the people of the rivers like Ganga - Yamuna and Narmada have been praising it since ancient times
 ram, krishna or shiv kii aradhana yahan sadiyon se kii jaati rahi he
 Literature based on these deities has been created in all the languages of India
 uttar se dakshin or purv se pashchim tak sampoorn bharat main janm, vivaah or mrityu ke sanskaar ek samaan prachlit hai
 There is also similarity in various customs, practices and festivals
 bhashaaon kii vividhta avashya he phir bhi sangeet, nrity or natya ke moulik swaroopon main ascharyajanak samanta he
 The seven tones of music and the trital of dance are equally popular throughout India
 bharat anek dharmon, sampradaayon, maton or pruthak aasthaaon evam vishwaason kaa mahadesh he, tathaapi iskaa saanskrithik samucchy or anekta main ekta kaa swaroop sansar ke anya deshon ke liye vismay kaa vishay rahaa he
 Culture is closely related to life
 yah koi bahya vastu nahin he or na hi koi aabhushan he jise manushya prayog kar saken
 It is not just a touch of colors
 yah vah gun he jo hamen manushya banaata he
 Human beings will not exist without culture
 samskruti paramparaon se, vishwaason se, jivan kii style se, aadhyatmik paksh se, bhautik paksh se nirantar judi he
 It teaches us the meaning of life, how to live life
 maanav hi samskruti kaa nirmaataa he or saath hi samskruti maanav ko maanav banaati he
 a fundamental element of culture is religious belief and its symbolic expression
 hamen dharmik pahchaan kaa sammaan karnaa chahie, saath hi samayik prayatnon se bhi parichit hona chahie jinase antadharmik vishwaason kii baatcheet ho sake, jinhen praayah 'antah saanskrithik vaartalap' kaha jaataa he
 As the world continues to connect, we are becoming more and more global and living on a more global scale
 ham yah nahin soch sakate ki jeene kaa ek hi tarika hota he or vahi satya maarg he
 The need for coexistence has also made the coexistence of different cultures and beliefs necessary
 isliye isse pehle ki ham is prakaar kii koi galati karen, acha hoga ki ham anya samskritiyon ko bhi jaane or saath hi apni samskruti ko bhi bhalee prakaar samajhen
 How can we discuss about other cultures until we understand the values of our culture as well
 satya, shiv or sundar ye teen shaashvat mulya hai jo samskruti se nikat se jude hai
 It is culture that brings us closer to truth through philosophy and religion
 yah hamaare jivan main kalaon ke madhyam se soundarya pradaan karti he or soundaryanubhuthaparak maanav banaati he
 It is this culture that makes us moral human beings and brings us in close contact with other human beings and teaches us lessons of love, tolerance and peace
 kisi desh kii samskruti uski sampoorn maansik nidhi ko suchit karti he
 It is not the result of the effort of a particular person, but the result of the efforts of numerous known and unknown persons
 sab vyakti apni samarthy or yogyata ke anusaar samskruti ke nirmaan main sahyog dete hai
 Culture can be compared to the coral reefs found in the sea near Australia
 muunge ke asankhya keede apane chote ghar banaakar samaapt ho gaye
 Then new insects built houses, they also came to an end
 iske baad unki agali peedi ne bhi yahi kiya or yah kram hajaaron varsh tak nirantar chalata rahaa
 Today, the little houses of all those Moogas have taken the form of huge rocks connecting them
 samskruti kaa bhi isi prakaar dhire-dhire nirmaan hota he or unke nirmaan main hajaaron varsh lagate hai
 Humans live in different places and develop their specific culture by developing special social environments, institutions, practices, systems, religion, philosophy, script, language and arts
 bhartiya samskruti kii rachana bhi isi prakaar hui he
 Culture is a set of catalytic patterns of social interactions and social behaviors
 is samucchy main gyaan, vigyaan, kala, aasthaa, naitik mulya evam prathaen samavisht hoti hai
 Culture is the collective expression of man's best practices and perfect efforts suitable for physical, economic, social and political and spiritual emergence
 yah manushya ke vaiyaktik evam saamaajik jivan ke swaroop kaa nirmaan, nirdesan, niyaman or niyantran karti he
 Therefore, culture is a manifestation of a collectivist view in the life of man, ideological philosophy and social activities
 isamen pratikon dwaara arjeet tathaa sapreshit maanavvyavhaaron ke sunishchit pratimaan sannihit hote hai
 The inevitable convergence of culture is created by chronological and accumulated traditional ideas and related values
 iskaa ek paksh maanav vyavhaar ke nirdhaaran or doosraa paksh katipay vidhivihit vyavhaaron kii pramanikta tathaa auchitypratipaadan se sambhddha hota he
 Each culture incorporates the general principles of selectivity and selectivity, through which the paradigms of human behavior in the various forms of cultural half are degradable by normalization
 saanskrithik maan, prathaon ke samanyikrut evam susangathit samavaay ke rup main sthirataa kii ore unmukh hote hai, yadhyapi samskruti ke vibhinn tatwon main parivartan kii prakriya shaashvat chalati rahati he
 Changes in a particular component are the result of acceptance and disclaimer in accordance with cultural patterns
 saanskrithik pratimaan swayan bhi parivartansheel hote hai
 The eternal process of change in the state of society affects paradigms
 saamaajik vikaas kii prakriya saanskrithik pratimaanon ke parivartan kii prakriya he
 Culture is not natural
 yah samajikaran kii prakriya dwaara arjeet hoti he
 Therefore, culture is associated with those rites, which are the means of preserving our heritage and social heritage
 inke madhyam se saamaajik vyavhaar kii vishistataaon kaa ek peedi se duusari peedi main nigaman hota he
 It is in this continuity of incorporation that culture exists and its cumulative tendency accelerates its development, from which new ideals are born
 in aadarshon dwaara bahya kriyaaon or manovaigyanik drushtikonon kaa samanyan hota he tathaa saamaajik sanrachana or vaiyaktik jeevanapaddati kaa vyavasthaapan hota rahata he
 Culture has two sides - saamaanya arth main aadhibhautik samskruti ko samskruti or bhautik samskruti ko sabhyataa ke naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 These two sides of the culture differ from each other
 samskruti abhyantar he, isamen paramparaagat chintan, kalatmak anubhuti, vistrut gyaan evam dharmik aasthaa kaa samavesh hota he
 Civilization is an external object, which includes social, economic, political, and scientific achievements helpful in human progress
 samskruti hamaare samjik jeevanapravaah kii udgamasthali he or sabhyataa is pravaah main sahaayak upkaran
 Culture is practicable and civilization is the means
 samskruti sabhyataa kii upyogita ke moolyankan ke liye pratimaan upasthit karti he
 Despite these differences, culture and civilization are interconnected and influence each other
 saanskrithik mulyon kaa spasht prabhaav sabhyataa kii pragati kii disha or swaroop par padataa he
 The civilization that is built according to these values is adopted by society
 sabhyataa kii naveen uplabdhiyaan bhi vyavhaaron, hamaari manyataon yaa duusare shabdon main hamaari samskruti ko prabhavit karti rahati he
 The process of sync goes on continuously
 sampark main aanevaali bhinn samskritiyaan bhi ek duusare ko prabhavit karti hai
 The interaction of different cultures leads to a process of cooperation or non-cooperation among them
 par donon prakriyaaon kaa lakshya vishmata ko samaapt kar samta sthaapan hi hota he
 Arrangement and assimilation in the state of cooperation are the means of equity establishment and in the event of non-cooperation, the forces of competition, opposition and struggle are activated and finally the strong culture ends the weak culture and establishes equality

 Whenever there is a bend in a road, by raising the floor of the road on the bend at that turn, the road has been made sloping
 isi prakaar rail ke maarg main bhi mode bahari patari bhitari se thodi unchi rakhi jaati he
 The sloping of the road surface, or railroad path, in this way is called sloping or inclination

 If a train moves faster than imagined, then the lateral pressure is taken out of the wheels by the lateral pressure
 uthanvaala koi bhi mode keval us gati se yatra karne ke liye sukhad hota he jiske liye sadak banaai jaati he
 But on the road, a variety of trains run at both fast and slow speeds
 dhimi chaal se chalanevaali gadiyon ko, jaise baiylgaadiyon or anya jaanwaron se khinchi janevaali savaariyon ko, jo kalpit gati se kahin kam gati par chalati hai, adhik dhaal se asuvidha hoti he
 For this reason, according to the standards of the Indian Road Congress in India, the limit of slope has been fixed at 1 in 15
 duusare deshon main yadhyapi 10 main 1 tak kii dhaal kii anumati hoti he, to bhi saadhaarant: dhaal 15 main 1 se adhik nahin hoti
