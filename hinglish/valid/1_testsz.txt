 In the sixteenth century, several events occurred in England, resulting in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church
 ise hi england kaa dharmasudhar kehete hai
 These incidents were linked in part to the Protestant Reformation in Europe

 With this, many changes were made in the worship system of the Church of England
 in sab kaarnon se ab england kaa carch 'anglican carch' kaha jane laga
 Following Edward's death, attempts were made to re-establish Catholicism and the supremacy of the pope in England during the reign of Mary Tudor, and also inflicted death sentences on nearly 300 reformers, including Archbishop Cranmer, Latimer and Riddle

 Conversely, in England, King Henry VIII started the Reformation movement and ministers of his successor Edward VII and Queen Agilabeth made the new religion mandatory for the subjects and in place of the Pope, King became the patron and supreme authority of the Church of England
 
 henry ashtum ne apni patni kevarine ke talaak kii anumati pope dwaara nahin diye jane par pope kaa virodh kiya or act of supremeesi paarit kar vah england ke carch kaa sarvocch adhikari ho gaya

 henry ashtum kaa uddeshy dharm main sudhaar nahin tha
 He retained the principles of Catholicism even after severing ties with the Pope
 uski sahanubhuti na to luutherwaad ke prati thi or na calvinavaad ke prati
 He was opposed to the Pope only, so in England he destroyed the power of the Pope
 dharm sudhaar kaa yah kaaran vyaktigat tha
 Henry VIII punished both Catholics and Protestants
 usne catholicon ko isliye dandit kiya ki ve use carch kaa pramukh or sarvesarva nahin maanate the or protestanton ko isliye dandit kiya kiya ki ve catholic dharm ke siddhanton ko nahin maan te the
 The spread of religious reform in England gradually began during the reign of Edward Sixt

 Bhairav is the god of Tamas in terms of worship
 unako bali di jaati he or jahaan kahin yah pratha samaapt ho gayi he vahaan bhi ek saath badi sankhya main nariyal phod kar is krity ko ek pratik ke rup main sampann kiya jaataa he
 It is a historical truth that Bhairava is the deity of the fiery Kapalika sect and his worship in Tantra Shastra is predominant
 tantra sadhak kaa mukhya lakshya bhairav bhav se apane ko aatmsaat karnaa hota he
 In Hindustani classical music, a raga is named Bhairava after him
 kalbhairav kii pujapraay: puure desh main hoti he or alag-alag anchalon main alag-alag naamon se vah jane-pahachaane jate hai

 bhoot, pret, pishaach, putana, kotra or revati aadi kii gananaa bhagwaan shiv ke anyatam ganon main kii jaati he
 In other words, he is the supremacy of various diseases and objections plagues
 shiv pralay ke devtaa bhi hai, at: vipatti, rog evam mrityu ke samast doot or devtaa unke apane sainik hai
 Mahabhairava is the ruler or commander of all these ganas
 sidhi bhashaa main kahen to bhay vah senapati he jo beemaari, vipatti or vinaash ke parshv main unke sanchaalak ke rup main sarvatra hi upasthit dikhaayi detaa he
 According to 'shivpuran', Ashtami of Krishnapaksha of Kartik month originated Bhairava in the mid-afternoon from the part of Lord Shankar, hence this date is also known as kaal-bhairavashtami
 puranic aakhyaanon ke anusaar andhakasur naamak daitya apane krityon se aniti va atyaachaar kii simaaen paar kar rahaa tha, yahan tak ki ek baar ghamand main chur hokar vah bhagwaan shiv tak ke upar akraman karne kaa dussahas kar baitha
 tab uske sanhaar ke liye shiv ke rudhir se bhairav kii utpatti hui
 According to some Puranas, Bhairava was born as an insult to Shiva
 yah sristi ke prarambhkaal kii baat he
 Creator Brahma, seeing the costumes of Lord Shankar and the appearance of his Ganas, called Shiva with a contemptible word
 apane is apmaan par swayan shiv ne to koi dhyaan nahin diya, kintu unke sharir se usee samay krodh se compymaan or vishaal dandadhari ek prachandkay kaaya prakat hui or vah brahma kaa sanhaar karne ke liye aage bad aayi
 Seeing this, the shout shouted with fear
 shankar dwaara madhyasthata karne par hi vah kaaya shant ho saki
 The same body originated from Rudra's body got the name of Mahabhairava
 baad main shiv ne use apni puri, kaashi kaa nagarpal niyukt kar diya
 It has been said that Lord Shankar destroyed the ego of Brahma on this Ashtami, so this day began to be celebrated as Bhairav ashtami fast
 bhairav ashtami 'kaal' kaa samaran karaati he, isliye mrityu ke bhay ke nivaaran hetu bahut se log kalbhairav kii upasna karte hai
 It is also said that Lord Brahma used to have five faces and Brahma Ji was going to compose the fifth Veda as well, when Lord Shiva spoke to Lord Brahma at the behest of all the Gods, but he did not understand and was furious with Mahakal
 , Bhairava appeared in a fierce form and he cut off the fifth face of Brahma ji with the stroke of Nakhon, on this Bhairav also felt the sin of killing Brahma, kaalaantar main bhairav-upasna kii do shakhaaen- batuka bhairav tathaa kaal bhairav ke rup main prasiddh huin
 While Batuk Bhairav is famous in the gentle form giving fear to his devotees, Kaal Bhairava became famous as a fierce punisher who controls criminal tendencies
 tantrashastra main asht-bhairav kaa ullekh he – In the Kalika Purana, Bhairava, like Nandi, Bhringi, Mahakal, Vetal, has been described as one of the Ganesha of Shiva whose vehicle is a dog
 brahmavaivartpurana main bhi a meditator without meditation is silent like, meditation also has its own special significance in Bhairav sadhana
 kisi bhi devtaa ke dhyaan main keval nirvikalp-bhav kii upasna ko hi dhyaan nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Meditation means - the entire shape of that deity reflected in the moment
 shri batuka bhairav ji ke dhyaan hetu inke satvik, rajas va taamas roopon kaa varnan anek shastron main miltaa he
 While Satvik Meditation - Prevents Aprautmu, provides age-healing and salvation, there is the use of Rajas Meditation for the accomplishment of religion, meaning and work, similarly Tamas Meditation, which reduces the enemy through Kriti, Bhoot, Grihadi
 Having said
 granthon main likhaa he ki grihasth ko sadaa bhairavaji ke satvik dhyaan ko hi praathamikta deni chahie

 jaigarh ke prasiddh kile main kaal-bhairav kaa bada pracheen mandir he jisamen bhootpurv maharaja jaipur ke trust kii or se dainik puja-archana ke liye paaramparik-pujari niyukt hai
 There is also a temple of Sri Kala Bhairav in village Adegav in Seoni district of Madhya Pradesh which is inside the fort which is known as Garhi Up
 kehete hai aurangzeb ke shashan kaal main jab kaashi ke bharat-vikhyath vishwanath mandir kaa dhwans kiya gaya, tab bhi kalbhairav kaa mandir puri tarah achoota bana rahaa tha
 According to public opinion, when Aurangzeb's soldiers reached there to break the temple of Kalabhairava, suddenly a whole group of mad dogs had left somewhere
 un kutton ne jin sainikon ko kaata ve turant pagal ho gayi or phir swayan apane hi saathiyon ko unhone kaatna shuru kar diya

 Human sexuality is the way people experience and express themselves sexually

 It may be that the per capita income of a particular country is low in monetary terms but the monetary value of economic activities in that country is much higher
 isliye ise kisi desh ke vikaas kaa ekmaatr paimaana mana ja saktaa

 paryaavaran main maanav paryaavaran ke aapasi sambandh bhi shaamil hai, jaise ki saamaajik, saanskrithik or aarthik parivesh kaa jaev-bhautik vaataavaran ke saath sambandh
 Like all management functions, it also requires effective management, standards and systems
 paryaavaran prabandhan ke maanak yaa pranali yaa protocol, kisi upyukt maandand dwaara maape gaye paryaavarniya prabhaav ko kam karne kii cheshtaa karte hai
 The ISO 14001 standard is the most commonly used standard for environmental risk management and is closely associated with the European eco-management and Audit Scheme
 ek saamaanya auditing maanak ke rup main iesao 19011 maanak main ise gunvattta prabandhan ke saath jodne ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 Other environmental management systems are based on the ISO 14001 standard and many systems extend this in different ways: kuch anya ranneetiyaan bhi maujuud hai jo parformens audit tathaa purna cost acounting kaa istemaal karne vaali top-down management "pranaaliyon" ko viksit karne kii bajaay bhed karne ke saadhaaran tareekon par nirbhar karti hai
 For example, Ecological Intelligent Design divides products into consumable, service products or durable or non-toxic products that should not be bought by anyone, or many times customers do not even know they are buying them
 Huh
 aise avikrey utpaadon ko bazaar se baahar rakhkar kisi "pranali" kaa istemaal kiye bina hi behatar paryaavaran prabandhan ko praapt kar liya jaataa he
 Recent successes have led to the notion of "integrated management"
 isamen ek vyapak drushtikon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he or antahvishay moolyankan ke mahatv ko kam kiya jaataa he
 This is an interesting notion but not favorable everywhere

 The wavelength of the scattering radiation depends only on the angle of scattering
 compton prabhaav ke spashtikaran ke liye 1923 i
 main kaanpton or debaai ne swatantra rup se yah dharna apanaai ki kisi disha main chalate hue photaan main jo urja / samveg hota he unka kul Or may give only a small portion
 isse prakeern photaan kii urja, jisamen plank sthiraank he or vikiran kii aavriti he, apati photaan kii urja se kam hoti he or photaan se sambandhit tarangaayam bad jaataa he
 This is clearly contrary to the wave theory of photon-electron-collision-pattern radiation
 san 1924 i
 main bor, creckers or slator ne ek duusare praturup kaa suzav rakhaa jo tarangvaad par aadhaarit tha
 In this model, the laws of energy stability and momentum are applied only to the statistical mean of multiple collisions, rather than to any solitary interaction of radiation and electrons
 atev apati vikiran tamson ke tarangavaadi praturup ke anuroop satat prakeern hota he, par saath main kabhi-kabhi ek pratikshep electron bhi prakirnak se nikalataa he
 This model was successful in explaining the increase in wavelength due to the vibrational result, but ultimately became invalid on the basis of some experimental results, and only the photon – electron – collision-model of validation, computation, and debi was found
 kaanpton-debaai-praturup ke anusaar pratikshipt electron or prakeern vikiran kaa utpaadan saath hi saath hona aavashyak he
 According to quantum mechanics in this simultaneity, the time uncertainty is about 10–21 seconds and in the latest experiments, the time constant has reached close enough to this limit
 kaanpton-debaai ke photaan praturup main urja or samveg kii sthirataa kaa upyog karke pratikshipt electron or prakeern photaan kii dishaao main ek yatharth sambandh miltaa he
 This relationship is satisfactorily confirmed by modern experiments
 dirack kii kwantum yantriki ke siddhanton ke anusaar vidyucchumbakeey kshetra or ek electron ke bich ant: kriya kaa spashtikaran purnat: bhinn rup se kiya gaya he
 In this model, in addition to the initial and final positions of the interaction, there is also a medium state, in which only the momentum remains constant, not energy
 is ant:sth sthiti main ek electron ek photaan ko utshaarit kar saktaa he yaa ek photaan kaa avasorana kar saktaa he
 Thus, there is a possibility of two options in the Kapton result: in donon vikalpon kaa vichaar karke electron ke vidyucchumbakeey vikiran ke prakirnan kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he or usase jo nishkarsh nikle hai ve aadhunik prayogon dwaara urja ke paryaapt vistaar ke liye siddh kiye ja chuke hai
 The conclusions of compton-debai are particular forms of this general conclusion
 yadi prakeern padaarth main ham electron kii purnataya swadhin or sthir maane or yadi apati photaan kii urja ho or prakeern photaan kii urja ho, to urja sthirataa or samveg sthirataa ke niyamon kaa upyog karke hamen nimnlikhit sameekaran milte hai : Where h⁄mec ko electron kaa compton tarangadairghy kehete hai; iskaa maan 2

 uske baad isha ke 13 wein shatabdi se lagbhag 15 veen shatabdi tak coach kamta rajya main sen / khen vansh kaa rajya shashan kaayam tha
 During this period, the Sena Samrajya extended from the Brahmaputra of Assam east to the present day Tripura Mizoram, from the Gandak River in Nepal

 Its second increased city and administrative center was in Gograha
 coach kamta rajya main Alauddin Hussain shah kaa shashan zyada tik nahin paaya
 In 1515, Koch dynasty emerged in Koch Kamata state due to the influence of local coaches and Mech tribes

 Shri Satidas Surana was an ardent devotee of Ambe Mata
 seth satidas kii manokamana thi ki devi unke ghar main putree ke rup main janm le
 Mata Ambe Devi fulfilled her wishes and took birth in the form of daughter Ashwin Shukla Dwitiya of Samvat 1219 in Nagaur

 Seth Satidasji was called and proposed to him
 sethji is baat ko sunakar bahut dukhi hue or kaha, “musalmaan or hindu ke bich yah vivaah sambandh kaise ho saktaa he?”kintu soobedaar apni jid par tha
 Failing to obey, he threatened to crush the whole family in the crusher

 Then what? The Subedar immediately sent him to jail

 Then they became unhappy and started to remember Lord Arihant God
 prarthana karte vakt unhen neend aa gai
 In his dream, a stunning idol gave him a parable that said: - ""ghabaraane kii baat nahin he
 This is not his place
 
 You will call that wicked one

 Everyone got patience and a message was sent to the Subedar immediately

 Preparations started with enthusiasm on both sides

 Very soon, after taking a lot of punishment, some soldiers came to Sethji's building with some soldiers
 daudane se purv unhone apane ghar ke daravaaje par kunkum bhare haath kaa chapa lagaaya

 The race started with the first ray of sunrise
 donon milon daudte rahe parantu faasla yathaavat rahaa
 When Suswani ji is tired of running, she has prayed! Protect me, i can't run anymore adhishthatri devi ne prarthana suni tabhi saamne se ek singh aata hua dikhaai padaa devi ne akashwani main unhen singh par savaar hokar aage badhane ko kaha
 According to knowledge, Suswani immediately rode on the lion and the lion started running
 chalate-chalate vartmaan bikaner ke antargat shri sindhu morkhana gaanv ke najadik pahunch gai
 There was a very ancient temple of Lord Shivshankar Bholenath
 Here too Suswani prayed to Bholenath, "lord, protect me
 mujhe chhipane kaa sthaan do
 "bhole Shiva appeared and threw his tongs towards the front of the temple and said -" o Goddess, you go straight to where the tong has fallen, where is your place
 "bholenath kaa phenkaa hua chimata ek ker ke ped ke bich main padaa tha

 Four fingers of Sujvani's rag were left out

 Electromagnetic or 'energetics' are generally called all those devices used to measure electrical energy
 vidyut-maapi praayah kilowat-ghanta main anshaankit hote hai
 Some electrical measurements are arranged for special functions, such as the maximum demand detector, which consists of a time fraction with a meter that directs maximum energy over a certain period of time
 kuch vidyut-maapi aise bhi hote hai jo mahattam lod ke samay main swayan lod ko kaat den
 In order to measure the electrical energy that is suitable in a given period, it is necessary that the current, voltage and power coefficient in the electromagnetic circuit are able to make proper measurements of the three and measure the energy spent in a given period by integrating them
 
 is prakaar kisi bhi vidyutmapi main do anshak hote hai : The power fraction is of different nature in direct current and alternating current
 disht dhara main, shakti gunank na hone ke kaaran, shakti anshak kaa keval dhara tathaa voltata kaa gunan karne main samarth hona paryaapt he
 If the voltage is assumed to be constant, only current measurement can work
 is rup main vidyutmapi vastut: ampiore-ghanta meter ho jaataa he
 It only tells how much current has been used in a certain period of time
 is prakaar ek ampiore-ghanta se taatpary he ki nishchit voltata par 1 ghante main 1 ampiore dhara upbhukt kii gai hai
 Although such devices are simple in design, they obviously cause a fault in the energy directed by them as the voltage decreases
 tab bhi apane saral banaavat ke kaaran, saamaanya upyogon ke liye ye bahut upyukt hote hai
 In the above type of meter, a disk of aluminum is attached to a closed cell, so that it can be freely operated
 prakoshth main paara bharaa hota he or discs paare ke utplavan par avlambit rahata he
 Due to the relative density of 13
6, the mercury exerts considerable penetration on the disc, reducing the pressure on the bearings and allowing the disc to rotate
 discs ke donon ore do chumbak hote hai, jinamein se ek chaalan chumbak kehalaata he: or doosraa brake chumbak 
 It also acts as a carrier of a stream
 dhara ghuraagra se hokar discs main areey bahati he or vahaan se paare main hokar prakoshth par ke sthir terminal main jaati he
 Thus the circuit is completed through the mercury and the current flowing through the excitation coil of the conduction magnet exerts a driving force on the disk
 discs paribhraman ke liye swamantra hone ke kaaran ghoomane lagata he
 His brake revolves around the magnet field, applying brake force on it
 brake-chumbak kii sthiti kaa vyavasthaapan karne se discs kii gati main parivartan kiya ja saktaa he
 If the motor is not running properly, the position of the stopping magnet can be corrected by administering it
 duusare prakaar ke ampiore ghanta maapiyon main dhara ke vidyut apghatni prabhaav kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Over a given period of time, the amount of residue that is passed through the electrolyte is deposited in proportion to the energy consumed in the circuit
 parantu is praroop ke metron kii banaavat majboot nahin hoti or unhen baar baar vyavasthit karnaa padataa he
 Therefore, meters of this type are not very popular
 disht dhara ke metron main shakti anshak watametre jaise hi hote hai
 They actually have two circuits, in donon kundaliyon kii dhara evam voltata ke kshanik maanon dwaara prabhavit hone ke kaaran, anshak kaa chalanatantr paripath main ausat shakti kaa parichaayak hota he

C
 Meters, mainly, are of two types: donon meter vastav main apane apane praroop ke watametre par hi aadhaarit hote hai
 Energy can be measured only by combining the calipers with the thermometer
 kashenshak vastav main ghadi kii bhanti hota he, jo nishchit avadhi main shakti kaa samakarlan kar urja kaa nirdesh karata he
 Power can be directed by the indicator in the wattmeter
 jabaki vidyut maapi main discs ke paribhraman ginaney se urja kaa maapan hota he
 a calculator is used to count the revolutions of a disc or drum, from which the value of total energy can be read
 ek duusare praroop ke meter main vastut: motor kaa chota ang hi kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 It consists of a current coil, a stirrer, and a voltage coil as an armature
 armechar se saath commutator bhi hota he or sansparsh karanevaale do burush hote hai
 Thus the meter is, in fact, a minor form of motor
 ise is kaaran 'motor meter' hi kaha jaataa he, parantu yah adhik mahanga hone ke kaaran or dekhbhaal kii kathinaaiyon ke kaaran, bahut kam prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Energy measurement in triphase circuits is also done on the basis of triphage power measurement
 trifage watametre kii bhanti, inamen bhi shakti anshak do bhaagon main sanghatit hota he or sangyojan bhi do watametre dwaara shaktimaapan ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 In this way it has 6 terminals and they are connected like a triphase wattmeter
 keval kaal anshak tathaa ganan tantra jod dene se yah urja kaa maapan kar saktaa he
 The development of microelectronics and microcontrollers etc
 has made the development of electronic energies possible
 inkaa disple LCD yaa LED par aadhaarit hota he
 Some meters also have the ability to transmit readings to remote locations
 iske alaava electranik urjamapi supplai tathaa lod ke kuch anya prachalon ko bhi record kar sakate hai, jaise- adhiktam maang, voltage, shakti gunank, reective shakti aadi
