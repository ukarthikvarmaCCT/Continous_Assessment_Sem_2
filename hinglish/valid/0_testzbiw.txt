 uttam tap sampadit karembhadramah ke sud gyaras ko digambar jain samaaj ke pavaadhiraj paryushan dasalakshan parv kaa saatvaan din hota he Tapa means not only fasting food, but it is not only that
 Tapa means that keeping all your desires and desires with all these activities, such austerity increases good quality deeds
 Spiritual practice is the only way to not increase desires
 The first Tirthankara Lord Adinath had meditated for six months and attained supreme bliss salvation
 It is not possible to do austerities like our Tirthankaras at this time, but we also have the same sentiment and 10 days of Paryushan Pav
 During fasting, do meditation and try to walk the path of attaining supreme bliss Moksha
 uttam tyaag sampadit karembhadramah ke sud baras ko digambar jain samaaj ke pavaadhiraj paryushan dasalakshan parv kaa aathvaan din hota he From the word 'renunciation', it is known that it means to leave and subdue your desires by making life satisfied, it not only enhances good quality deeds but also destroys bad deeds
 The highest in Jainism because Jain saint Sifa does not even give up his clothes and gives up his whole life by wearing Digambara mudra
 The power of human being is not tested by how much wealth he has, but by how much sacrifice he has left! uttam tyaag dham hamen yahi sikhaata he ki man ko santoshi banaake hi ichchhaaon or bhaawanaaon kaa tyaag karnaa mumkin he 
 tyaag kii bhaavana bhitari aatma ko shuddh banaakar hi hoti he 
uttam akinchanya sampadit karembhadramah ke sud teras ko digambar jain samaaj ke pavaadhiraj paryushan dasalakshan parv kaa nauvaan din hota he The accusation teaches us to renounce attachment
 There are ten potentialities that we can own outwardly; Land, house, silver, gold, money, grain, female servants, male servants, clothes and resources can not only keep the desire of all these, they can not only control the desires but also increase the quality of work
 The soul can be made pure by renouncing all the temptations such as misconception, anger, arrogance, treachery, greed, mockery, dislike, fear, grief, and lust
 It is possible to attain supreme bliss salvation
 uttam brahmacharya sampadit karembhadramah ke sud chuds ko digambar jain samaaj ke pavaadhiraj paryushan dasalakshan parv kaa dasavaan din hota he is din ko anant chaturdashi kehete he is din ko log paramatma ke samaksh akhand diya lagaate he Brahmacharya teaches us to renounce those perils that are connected to our physical contact, such as sleeping on the ground and not on mattress pillows, not using anything more than necessary, spending life, living with simplicity by not spending, attachment, lust
 Any saint follows it and especially Jainsant follows it most with body, tongue and mind
 'brahm' jiskaa matlab aatma, or 'charya' kaa matlab rakhana, isko milakar brahmacharya shabd bana he, brahmacharya kaa matlab apni aatma me rahanaa he 
brahmacharya kaa paalan karne se aapako puure brahmad kaa gyaan or shakti praapt hogi or aisa na karne par aap sirf apni ichchhaaon or kaamnaayo ke gulam hi hai 
 In the evening of Anant Chaturdashi, in the evening, all the people in the temple, while performing a retribution together, ask for forgiveness if they have known and inadvertently hurt their hearts and sins committed throughout the year
 Forgive each other and ask for forgiveness from each other, with folded hands and embracing, they do mischievous doom

 Robert Owen was a social reformer and entrepreneur
 unki gananaa samaajwaad evam sahakaarita aandolan ke sansthaapakon main kii jaati he
 Before saying anything about the father of cooperative Robert Owen, we have to remember that he was not a fundamental thinker of the theory of cooperatives
 usase pehle bhi aarthik sansadhano ke vikendrikaran ke paksh main anek arthshaastri apana paksh rakh chuke the
 Even the word of companionship, synonymous with cooperative, had already emerged
 kintu isse rabart oven kaa yogadan kam nahin ho jaataa
 uski mahatta is baat main he ki usne sahakaar ko vyaavhaarikta ke dharaatal par saakaar karne kii koshish apni puri eemaandaaree or samathrya ke saath kii
 Always worked devotedly for his thoughts
 haalanki use antat asafalataa hi hasil hui; magar tab tak duniya sahakaar ke samathrya se puri tarah parichit ho chuki thi
 Oven was born on 14, May 1771, in Newtown, a simple town in Centralvale
 saat bhai-bahanon main se ek oven ke pita saadhaaran vyapaaree the
 His shop was for the sale of iron tools
 While the mother belonged to a thriving farming family
 oven kaa bachapan ghaney abhaavon ke bich beetaa
 uski shiksha kii shuruyaat to thik-thaak hui magar vah puri ho usase pehle, maatra nau varsh kii avasthaa main hi use skool chhodkar naukari kerani padi
 kaam kii talash main vah apane sabase bade bhai wiliam ke saath landan chalaa gaya
 He got his first job as a tailor in Lancashire
 kuch varshon tak oven vahaan par kaam sikhta rahaa
 Owen spent nine years ahead of him working
 Gradually he accumulated some money and some dreams too
 is bich mahattvakankshaayen jo paristhitivash kuch samay ke liye dab gai thim, ve phir se sir uthaane lageen
 The steam engine was invented only a few years before that, because of the steam powered looms revolutionized the textile industry
 isi kaaran manchester ke kapadaa udyog kaa un dinon bada naam tha
 In the last months of 1790, Owen borrowed a hundred pounds from his elder brother William
 apni mahattvakankshaon kaa khubasurat sapana man main sajaae ek din vah manchester pahunch gaya
 With his modest capital, he started a small factory to weave a thread shoe together with Joan
 jone usase pehle maikenic kaa kaam karata tha
 Given the work, the capital of a hundred pounds was very less
 badi companiyon ke saath kathin spardhaa main oven kii mil tik nahin pai
 In the meantime, there were problems with the partnership with Joan
 isliye maatra teen maheene ke antaraal main jone ke saath apane saajhedaari todakar oven ne apane alag kaarkaane kii neenv rakhi
 Owen was struggling to keep him running when he was reported to be vacant as manager in a large factory in Manchester
 usne apni mil kaa laalach chhod diya or us naukari par ja laga
 At that time he was only twenty-one years old
 vah ek prakaar se satat sangharsh evam safalataa kii shuruyaat thi
 He was hardworking and diligent
 chah maheene ke alp samay main hi vah mil maalik ke dilo-dimag par apni kaaryastylee kaa sikaa jamaane main safal ho gaya
 Five hundred laborers worked in that factory at that time
 oven ke liye yah badi uplabdhi thi, kintu uski safaltaaon kaa sahi myne main to yah prarambh hi tha
 Own night-hard work, talent and dedication, Owen brought the factory to Britain's best in just a few years
 oven udhyamshiltaa kaa anumaan maatra ek udhaaharan se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki usne apane kaarkaane ke liye america dwipon se rooyee kaa aayaat kiya
 It was the first cotton import from the southern states
 yahi nahin oven ne rooyee katai ke kaary main bhi ullekhneey dakshata praapt kii
 Undeniably his factory was one of the best spinning factories in the then Britain; Whose success can be attributed to anyone, it was only Owen
 ikis varsh kaa tarun oven 1795 main menchester ke ek ore badi kapadaa mil kalrton twist company kaa prabandhak or hissedaar ban chukaa tha; jisase uskaa naam vahaan ke sarvaadhik safal udhyamiyon main gina jane laga
 At the same time Owen had to move to New Lanark from his factory work, which was a very suitable place for the textile industry due to its geographical location
 tab tak vah ek sudarshan yuvak ban chukaa tha
 In fact, Owen was told that David Dale, a famous New York textile businessman, wanted to deal with his textile mills
 david del kii khyaati doordarshee evam kaamyaab udhyamiyon main hoti thi
 Owen's fame had reached him
 uski bejod pratibha or laganshiltaa se del chamatkrit the
 Upon arriving in New Lenark, there was another pleasant twist in Owen's life
 david del kii ek beti thiμkarolina del
 yuva oven uske pyaar main pad gaya
 Carolina also could not escape her attraction
 david del ne oven ke haathon na keval kapadaa milon ke ek hisse kaa sauda kiya, balki apni kanya kaa vivaah bhi uske saath kar diya
 It was the event of September 1799, which brought Owen to many achievements simultaneously
 vivaah ke pashchaat oven vahiin apana ghar banaakar rahane laga
 The factory in New Lenark was started in 1784 by Dale and Richard Arcaride
 factory us samay new lenark kii sabase badi kapadaa milon main se ek thi; jise chalaane ke liye jal-shakti kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 More than two thousand employees worked in it; Of which about five hundred were children of poor families
 bacchon main bhi adhikansh kii aayu paanch se chah varsh ke bich thi
 The same situation was prevalent in most textile mills in those days
 david del yadhyapi balshramikon kaa puraa dhyaan rakhte the, lekin koi kargar vyavastha na hone ke kaaran mazdooron, visheshkar balshramikon kii dasha shochaneey bani hui thi
 Most of the workers belonged to extremely poor, uneducated families
 ashiksha, kuntha or hataasha ke kaaran chori, jua, sharaab or nashakhori jaisi anek kureetiyaan unke jivan main pravesh kar chuki thim
 In the name of household, they all had a room, small and dirty, in which clean air was impossible
 bacchon kii padhai kii vyavastha to dur bimaaron ke ilaaj ke liye bhi koi intjaam nahin tha
 By that time, Owen had attained great prosperity and prosperity
 vivaah ke pashchaat uske aatmavishvaas main vruddhi bhi khub hui
 But Owen's ambitions were yet to end
 uske bhavishya kii ruparekha isi aatmavishvaas ke aadhaar par tay honi thi, kyonki yah uskaa aatmavishvaas hi tha jisane use kathor faisle lene kii prerana di, jisase vah aaajeevan apane vichaaron evam uddeshyon ke liye sangharshrat rah sakaa
 Owen corrected criticisms of his government and industrialists for his revolutionary decisions
 His partners left him and left
 karodo rupee kii sampatti jo usne kathin parishram se arjeet kii thi, dhire-dhire uski kalyankari yojanaon kii bhant chadh gai
 But it is not new for the great men to walk separately in history, to do new work, to set new standards for the coming generations
 itihaas kaa darbar aisi hi chunautiyon ko paar karne vaale mahapurushon ko sahejane main garvanubhuti karata he
 Owen Cora was not a businessman
 uske paas khubasurat or samvedansheel maanas bhi tha, jo dusron ko ksht main dekhte hi vichlit ho uthta tha
 He himself came from a poor family
 is kaaran garibi kii vivashtaaon or kashton se vah bhalee-bhaanti parichit tha
 In those days, where there was an abundance of big factories in New Lenark, there were also many small settlements of poor laborers around it
 vahaan kaa jivan naarkeey tha
 Owen felt that the expected increase in productivity would not be possible without improving the living and conditions of the artisans and laborers
 isliye usne apane jivan ke agle das varsh mazdooron kii haalat sudhaarney ke naam kar die
 He saved the laborers' settlements
 un bastiyon main swayan ja-jaakar mazdooron kii gandi aadaton ko chhudaane kaa prayaas kiya
 By reducing the working hours of the child laborers, arranged their education and entertainment
 mahila mazdooron ke liye alag vishramghar or prasuti-kendron kii vyavastha kii
 On one hand, the life of the laborers was improved due to these efforts, yet the views of those workers who viewed industrialization with suspicion also changed
 nai vyavastha ke prati unka aakrosh kam hone laga
 As a result production increased, Owen also benefited
 dhyatavya he ki oven dwaara apane karmchaariyon ke kalyaan ke liye jitne bhi kadam uthaae gaye unke peeche uski vishuddh vyavsaayik drushti thi
 Like a skilled entrepreneur, he was adept at turning situations in his favor
 karl macrs ke sahyogi or macrsvaadi vichaarak fradrik anglas ne apane charchit lekh—socialism: Utopian and Scientific main spasht rup se ullekh kiya he ki— This is what Owen thought
 tulanaatmak rup main usne apane karmchaariyon ko behatar vaataavaran uplabdh karaane ke prayaas to kiye, magar ve unke vyaktitv evam buddhi ke chahumunkhi vikaas se kaaphi dur the
 They were allowed to use their discretion limited to very few, specific contexts
 oven par sudhaarwadiyon kaa prabhaav padaa tha
 He was an honored member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester
 scottish navajagaran andolan se prabhavit oven kaa maananaa tha ki manushya kaa vyaktitv uske vaataavaran se prabhavit evam vinirmit hota he
 Hence, personality can be refined by improving the environment
 ‘shiksha naitik jagat se sampark karaane vaala ingine he
 He was a supporter of this dictation of a historian, underlining the importance of education
 vyaktitv nirmaan ke liye shiksha kii anivaaryta darshaate hue usne kaha tha ki— In those days most of the factory owners used to pay their laborers on the basis of commodity exchange rather than cash wages
 tadnusaar mazdooron ko token de die jate the; jinaki kaarkaana maalikon ke samooh se baahar koi keemat na thi
 In exchange for those tokens, laborers could buy essential goods from the designated shops
 mazdooron kii vivashtaa kaa laabh uthaane ke liye un dukaanon par bhi unka khulaa shoshan hota tha
 The goods found there were cheap and expensive compared to the market
 us kuriti ke viruddh aawaaj uthne lagi to, british sansad ne gaiyrkanoonee qaraar dete hue usapar roak laga di thi
 Owing to the problem of laborers, Owen started a consumer center where good quality goods could be obtained by paying just above the cost price
 usne mazdooron ke charitrik vikaas ke liye bhi aavashyak kadam uthaae
 Knowing that laborers spend a large part of their earnings on alcohol and other intoxicants, Owen puts their sales under tight control
 yahi nahin oven ne apane kamgaaron ko upabhokta bhandaron se thok kharid ke liye bhi protsaahit kiya; jisase ve adhik bachat kar saken
 bachat par jor dete hue usne mazdooron ko kathin samay ke liye apni aay kaa ek hissaa anivaary rup se bachaane ke liye kaha
 balshramikon ke liye usne behatar paristhitiyon kaa srijan kiya
 Ensured their working hours and opened schools for compulsory education
 Owen's consumer stores had substantial success
 usee ne aage chalakar sahakaari kshetra ke upabhokta andolan ko prerit kiya
 However, cooperative consumer-led consumer centers were successfully launched almost four decades after the Rochelle Pioneers established the first consumer center in the Todlane area of london
 un dinon mil mazdooron ko pratidin kam se kam gyaarah ghante lagaataar kaary karnaa padataa tha
 Owen cut it to an hour per day
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon main yah kadam sahaspurn hone ke saath-saath chamatkaarik bhi tha
 His move was strongly opposed by other industrialists
 puunjipatiyon dwaara poshit samachaarpatr-patrikaon main oven ke is kadam kii aalochana karne vaale lekh chaape gaye
 Owen prohibited the work of children younger than ten years in his mill without being afraid of it
 mil-mazdooron ke liye kalyaan suvidhaon kaa vistaar karte hue usne unhen kaarkaane main hi awaas suvidhaayen pradaan kin
 Also established hospitals, restrooms and recreation houses
 un dinon kaam ke dauraan hui galatiyon kaa khamiyaja mazdooron ko hi bhugatna padataa tha, jisase unke vetan kaa bada hissaa nuksaan kii bharpai main hi nikal jaataa tha
 Owen ended the tradition of fines, which were strongly opposed by other industrialists
 magar oven apane nirnay par atal rahaa
 Owen's most important contribution was to manage children's education
 usne shishu paathshaalaon kii sthapana kii or sahakaar kaa janmdata hone ke saath-saath vah shishu shiksha kaarykram kaa prarvattak bana
 He launched a revolution, making education compulsory for five-year-old children
 yah sab oven ne keval apni aantarik prerana ke aadhaar par shuru kiya tha; jiskaa majdoorvarg kii ore joardaar swaagat kiya gaya
 It is worth noting that Owen was spending a lot of money on the construction of housing settlements for the workers, construction of hospitals, restrooms, recreation houses and baby schools
 majdoor kalyaan kaaryakramon par usase pehle itnaa bada nivesh kisi ne nahin kiya tha
 So initially people thought Owen's behavior was madness
 virdohi oven kaa majaak udaate, apane purvaagrah se bhare mastishk main uske ek din diwalia hone ke mansoobey sajaate
 kintu samay ke saath-saath logon ko sab samaj main aane laga
 Despite spending millions of pounds in labor welfare programs, Owen's factories were continuously generating profits, rather their profits were steadily increasing
 saath hi uski lokapriyata or prasiddhi main bhi nirantar ijapha ho rahaa tha
 Some of Owen's plans proved too expensive
 jisase uske hissedaaron ne virodh karnaa prarambh kar diya
 The partners wanted to run the factory in a normal way
 unase tang aakar oven ne ek nai company kii shuruyaat kii, jisamen usne vyavastha kii thi ki munaafe kaa beesvaan hissaa tayshuda lokahitaishi kaaryakramon par kharch kiya jayega
 jeremi bantham, wiliam ellen nai company main oven ke saajhedaar bane
 Owing to such thinkers, Owen's public programs were sure to get public acclaim
 is bich main oven vaicharik rup main bhi paripakv hua tha
 He was already influenced by Bentham's ideas
 apane vichaaron ko abhivyakti dete hue usne ek lanbaa lekh New View of Society, Or, Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the Human Character, and the Application of the Principle to Practice likhaa
 Owen's socialist views were very clear in that article written in several installments
 samaajwaad ke prati oven kii aasthaa aage bhi badhati hi gai
 Bentham was a supporter of the free market system
 uskaa maananaa tha ki mazdooron ko yah adhikaar ho ki ve apane liye apane pasandida vyapaaree yaa utpaadak ko chun saken
 usapar kisi pratyaksh athwa paroksh dabaav nahin hona chahie
 By then Owen's fame had grown
 saath main sthaneey prashasan par uskaa prabhaav bhi
 sudhaar kaaryakramon kaa udyogpatiyon kii ore se nirantar hote virodh se bhi vah vichlit nahin hua
 On the contrary, it intensified its efforts to make legal arrangements for the protection of labor rights
 balshramikon ke kaary-ghanton ko ghataane ke liye bhi oven ne bharpoor prayaas kiye
 But the only failures in this work were his hands; Because by then the industrialists and their supporting officials, who were in favor of maintaining the status quo, had become strong opponents of Owen
 tab tak oven kii khyaati britain kii simaaon ko langhakar baahar ja chuki thi
 Countries wishing for labor welfare wanted to implement the public welfare programs of Owen
 rus, halend, prasha ke tatkaaleen shaskaon ne oven ke paraamarsh ke anusaar majdoor sudhaar-kaarykram shuru kar die the
 Owen's reform programs were heavily supported by the working class
 uske kaarkaanon kaa munafa ascharyajanak rup se badha tha
 Another industrialist who was describing Owen's reform programs as his suicidal move, Owen stopped speaking by earning sixty thousand pounds in a single year
 usne dikhaa diya ki dhanarjan ke liye shoshan, beyimaani athwa galakat pratiyogita hi aavashyak nahin he
 If forward-looking work is done, it is possible to achieve the goal of progress through cooperation and mutual sympathy
 oven dharm ke naam par thopi ja rahi jad manyataon se bhi kshubdh tha
 He believed that the excessive interference of religion in life prevents man from making a logical decision that the pathetic condition of the working class is due to the stereotypes which he has brought up in the name of religion
 isliye apane lekhon main usne dharmik manyataon kii jamkar aalochana kii thi
 As a result, infinitely other influential people began to mobilize against the clergy and religion
 apane kalyaan kaaryakramon ke kaaran vah puunjipati varg ko pehle hi naaraaz kar chukaa tha
 So selfish entrepreneurs and religious contractors started a campaign against Owen
 prakarantar main isse oven kii pratishtha ko dhakka laga
 The oven was truly a great dreamer
 ek behatar duniya kaa sapana uski ankhon main sadaiv jhilamilaataa rahata tha
 In the early years of his life, his faith in religion had ended
 uskaa maananaa tha ki swarg jaisi sthitiyaan dharti se pare sambhav hi nahin he
 If big people use a little renunciation and foresight, then this earth can be made like heaven
 uske soch kaa aadhaar yah tha ki manushya apana vyaktitv swayan nahin, apitu swayan ke liye banaata he yani uski uplabdhiyon evam vyaktitv ke nirmaan main kisi na kisi prakaar dusron kaa bhi yogadan hota he
 Therefore, it is the duty of human beings to cooperate fully with the rest of the people so that maximum people can benefit
 swapndrushtaa hone ke saath vah sankalpavaan bhi tha
 He acted on his plans regardless of his criticism
 majdoor kalyaan ke kaaryakramon ke atirikt usne bacchon ke liye shiksha ko anivaary ghoshit kar bal shiksha sansthaanon kaa aadi pravatrthak hone kaa shrey liya
 He did many other experiments for the betterment of society; Which took valuable time as well as capital
 haalanki virodhiyon ke kaaran oven ko yadhyapi apekshit safalataa nahin mil saki, magar asafal rahakar bhi usne un raaston kaa anveshan kiya jis par bhavishya kii anek vikasgaathaayen likhi jaani thiμor aage jinka anusaran puri duniya ko karnaa tha
 The economic depression took place in 1815
 It became difficult for Owen to pursue reform programs
 isliye usko apane kaarykram kuch dinon ke liye sthagit karne pade
 tab tak oven ke vyavastha kii khaamiyon se parichit ho chukaa tha
 He felt that capitalist system and exploitation are two sides of the same coin
 poonjivadi vyavastha ke paravaan chadhane ke liye jaruri he ki samaaj me asantosh or dishaheenata ho
 Hunger, unemployment, poverty and illiteracy that make the common man helpless, help a successful industrialist build a palace of profit
 janata kii agyanta or digabhramata poonjeevaad ke vistaar ke liye utprerak ban jaati hai
 Seeing the socio-economic disparity of his time, he was getting bored and frustrated with the system responsible for him
 use vishwaas ho chalaa tha ki behatar kal ke liye vyavastha main amul parivartan atyaavashyak he
 Because the present system is promoting centralization of capital and exorbitant exploitation
 oven kii manahosthiti usee ke in shabdon se sahaj ujagar ho jaati he- These were the thoughts of a struggling, dreamy, diligent and visionary entrepreneur who had proved his entrepreneurial spirit in India and abroad
 vah bhi apane adwitiya sudhaar-kaaryakramon ke chalate, jisamen usne apane dhan or sansadhano kaa vyay kiya tha
 It is clear that Owen had all the flaws in the capitalist system
 usko vishwaas ho chalaa tha ki jis pragatigami samaaj kaa bimb uski ankhon main he, vah poonjivadi vyavastha ke dwaara athwa uske samarthan se sambhav hi nahin he
 a system that rests on self-exploitation and abnormality cannot be a carrier of socialism based on exploitation-free and equality
 He believed that a human is affected by his environment, so a change in his personality is possible with the change of environment
 haalanki uske vichaaron main kahin-kahin antarvirodh bhi dekhne ko milte hai
 Criticizing capital-driven supremacism, the French scholar Furrier stated that - vyapaarik mandi ke daur se guzarate hue oven dwaara 1816 main kii gai tippanee uski poonjivadi manovriti kaa pratik he
 He said that- ‘hamaara sarvottam graahak yuddh, ab samaapt ho chukaa he
 ' oven ko tatkaaleen factory system se ghrinaa thi
 He believed that this production system gave rise to social irresponsibility, destructive competition and heartless individualism
 uskaa vichaar tha ki saamaajik tanaav kaa ek kaaran maanviya shram or mashiinon kii avaanchit, aniyantrit spardhaa bhi he
 The solution to this is that human beings get organized and take production of machines and do production work
 isliye usne apane shramikon jivan-str main sudhaar laane ke liye kai kadam uthaae
 Not only this, while acknowledging the importance of high quality, he started giving special benefits and incentives to those employees who were skilled in making goods of better quality
 uske kaarkaane main prayek mashin ke baraabar main vibhinn rangon ke ghanaakaar tukade rakh die jate the
 The quality of the material made from the color of the cube was determined
 isse karigar ko apane kaam ke str kaa pataa hota tha
 Incentives were paid on the same basis
 spasht he ki us samay oven ke kaarkaanon main kaary kaa str or uski paristhitiyaan duusare kaarkaanon ke apeksha behatar, lagbhag adarsh avasthaa main thim
 Owen's influence on New Lenore was decreasing
 uske hissedaar bhi chhodkar ja chuke the
 But Owen's faith in morality and symbiosis did not diminish
 uski nigaah ab europe se baahar ke deshon par lagi thi
 Meanwhile, Owen's fame reached America and Owen received an invitation from America to go to New Harmony
 oven ne new lenark chhodane kaa faisla kar liya
 This decision was also indifferent to the new experiments of the British
 yun to sahjivan par aadhaarit bastiyaan basaane ke liye scotland, ireland aadi praanton se bhi prastaav aae the
 But Owen did not see any difference in the conditions there
 1824 main oven atlantic mahaasaagar paar karke hormani ;tauvadaladdh pahunchaa vahaan uskaa joardaar swaagat kiya gaya
 In 1825 he bought several acres of land at a place called New Harmony, Indiana for thirty thousand pounds to carry on the experiments of New Lanark
 jahaan usne new lenark ke prayogon ko aage badhaane ke dhyey se ek nai basti kii sthapana kii
 Within a few months the fame of New Harmony spread around the world
 vahaan mili safalataa se utsahit hokar oven ne oribiston ;vtpaipejavadaddh naamak sthaan par waisi hi ek or basti kii aadharshila rakhi
 Encouraged by the initial successes, Owen also settled in some other places
 Their names are Queen Wood; Funmad Lawyer, Rallatine; Tansanjpadam etc
 ve sabhi bastiyaan sahjivan ke siddhant ke aadhaar par basaai gai thim
 Owing to these settlements as before, Owen's dream was to exploit and establish a class-free society
 vah aise samaaj kii kalpana karata tha jahaan sabhi parsparikta par aadhaarit jivan-yaapan karen
 a colony should have 300 to 2000 members, who have arable land ranging from one thousand acres to 1500 acres
 basti ke sadasyon ke awaas ko chhodkar rasoighar, bhojanalay, sabha bhawan, skool, pustkaalay, aataa chakki, kaarkaane aadi samuhik haa or inke liye ek samachatubhuj ke aakaar kii vishaal imaarat ho
 Owen thought that such a system would reduce the value of money in life - which is the main reason for the habit of collection in humans
 san 1825 se 1829 tak oven ke siddhant ke aadhaar par basaai gai kul solah bastiyon main new haaramani sabase pehali or prasiddh thi
 But due to regional conditions problems started running the settlements
 darasal new haaramani jaise chote se praant main ek saath anek virgon ke log rahete the
 They all had different problems
 isliye new haaramani kaa prayog adhik lanbaa na khinch sakaa
 Owen's experiments in the US first met when one of his American partners parted ways with Owen
 ullekhneey he ki in sabhi kaaryon main oven kii dher sari puunji lagi thi; jisase uskaa vyavsaay buree tarah prabhavit hua tha
 Three-fourths of its total capital had already been spent in the settlement of New Harmony
 oven kaa maananaa tha ki sahjivan par aadhaarit vyavastha kii safalataa uske prayasaan kii vyapaktaa main hi sambhav he
 Any person has limitations, so for the success of such efforts, other people of the society also have to come forward
 sarkaar bhi to sabase adhik jimmedaari he hi
 Thinking the same, he also sought help from the government
 maamla sansad-patal par bhi rakhaa gaya
 But the proposal was rejected, considering it impractical
 oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyon kii khaasiyat thi ki vahaan kaa jivan samuhik evam sahyog par aadhaarit tha
 The entire colony was like a large family; Whose members' joys and sorrows were shared
 mahattvakankshaon main barabari thi
 Even collectivism had an influence on their dreams and resolutions
 oven kii spasht dharna thi ki aadarshonmukhi samaaj main saamaajik sambandhon kaa aadhaar laabh ke sthaan par seva hona chahie
 There should be transparency and co-operation in the work business, only then is it possible to get rid of exploitation
 oven un bastiyon ko sahjivan ke adarsh ke rup main sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 Owen's group of pro-socialists can easily see the glimpses of symbiosis in the anthem
 yah geet oven dwaara sthapit bastiyon main bade hi manoyog se gaaya jaataa tha-‘bhaaiyo utho! athulaneey prem se sarabor or paramasatya se abhasith din ke darshan karo
 Look up, humanity is eager to enjoy and bless community life in place of competition
 ab nyaay kii jeet hogi
 The suppression of the powerful will end, the bliss of universal bliss
 ’1 For twenty years he continued to work for the success of the collective life
 magar dhire-dhire asafalataa saaf najar aane lagi, kaaran ki in bastiyon main basane pahunche logon main adhikansh log aise the jinhen oven ke siddhanton main koi dilchaspee nahin thi
 Many criminals were of a mental attitude to him and the search for a safe haven took him to those settlements
 naakaara or kaamchor kism ke logon ko sir chhipaane ke liye oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyaan bahut anukool thim
 The second problem was that of dedicated workers there
 un bastiyon ke kushal sanchaalan ke liye jis prakaar ke swayan sevakon kii aavashyaktaa thi, unka vahaan saraasar abhaav the
 However, some of the people who came to the settlements had arrived there, truly devoted to Owen's ideas
 magar adhikansh keval shaukia, vakt bitaane ke liye vahaan chale aate the
 Some members of the New Harmony came out of the democratic tradition and wanted to open up the system
 unhen oven kaa ekadhikaar sweekaar nahin tha
 It is noteworthy that Owen's position in those settlements was similar to that of the head of the family
 parinaam yah hua ki oven dwaara basaai gai bastiyon main samasyaayein aane lageen
 In the words of John Curl ‘basti kaa gathan uske sadasyon ke utaavlepan ke saath hua tha
 Due to this, he had already announced his downfall
 shaayad unka aapas main milanaa hi durbhagyapurna tha
 In fact, the group formed on the basis of cooperatives was far from its spirit
 nau sau se adhik logon ke us samooh kaa sabase bada durbhaagya to yahi tha ki sahjivan kii shuruyaat karne se ve ek-duusare ko jaanate tak nahin the
 They included a wide variety of people from different places, different professions, surroundings, including working families, middle class intellectuals, and nomadic intellectuals who call themselves progressive
 samuhik bastiyon kaa gathan baari anubhavheenata kaa shikaar tha
 The result of which was seen in the form of fighting and quarreling
 People belonging to different backgrounds, castes had fought amongst themselves and fueled a feeling of disharmony in others, which was impossible to diagnose
 unke aapasi manmutav itane bad chuke the ki ant main jab samuhik bastiyon kaa prayog asafal hone kii ghoshnaa hui or log waapas lautne lage, to bhi unke parsparik jhagade lambey samay tak chalate rahe
 antat jameen kaa bantwaaraa kar, new haaramani ke nivasee anek sahakaar bastiyon, pariwaron main bant gaye
 ' new haaramani kaa prayog asafal hone ke pashchaat oven ne mexico main nae sire se phir koshish kii
 Due to the high poverty ratio there, he had high chances of success
 lekin aashaa ke vipareet mexico main uskaa saamana paramparawaadi carch se hua, jiskaa vahaan kii garib janata par atyadhik prabhaav tha
 The result was that Owen was boiling from America
 san 1828 main vah waapas england ke liye ravaanaa ho gaya
 But by then the circumstances of England had also changed
 samaajawaadee vichaardhaara teji se apni pakad bana rahi thi
 Intellectuals such as William Thomson were inventing new interpretations of democratic socialism
 sahakaarita par nae prayogon kaa silsilaa prarambh ho chukaa tha
 Workers' organizations were being formed
 samaajawaadee vichaadhara ko aadhaar maanakar nae-nae ubhare chartist andolankaaree sangharsh ke raste satta kii seedhiyaan chadhane kaa man bana chuke the
 He made three big strikes one after the other and made the government difficult
 jisase unhen lag rahaa tha ki ve sheeghra hi satta par savaar hokar bahut aasaani se badlaav ke lakshya ko praapt kar sakenge
 The settlements settled by Owen continued to expire
 dhyatavya he ki oven dwaara aadarshonmukhi samaaj kii yah sankalpana nai yaa anokhi nahin thi
 Nor was he the only intellectual-thinker who dreamed like that
 balki is tarah kii aadarshonmukhi samaaj kii sankalpana usase kareeb saadhe baaise sau varsh pehle plato bhi kar chukaa tha
 John Calvin, Thomas Moore, Rousseau, etc
 also made some similar sage concepts regarding ideal society
 oven yadi apane purvavarti vichaarkon se hatakar or badhkar tha to is kaaran ki vah kora siddhantkaar nahin tha, balki vichaaron ko moort rup dene vaala sachcha evam sankalpadharmee insaan tha
 In this way he was also fundamental in some cases
 usne na keval vargaheen or samanta par aadhaarit samaaj kaa sapana dekha, saath hi apane lakshya kii prapti ke liye usne anek safal prayog bhi kiye the
 It is a different thing that the success he got in the reform programs started decreasing later
 kyonki jis samaaj kaa sapana oven kii ankhon main bastaa tha, tatkaaleen paristhitiyaan uske vipareet thim
 Despite this, it is difficult to ignore Owen's successes
 oven poonjivadi arthvyavastha kaa virdohi tha
 Owen's experiment was ridiculed
 use ardhvikshipt or sanakee kahkar uphaas kaa paatr banaaya gaya
 Owen, however, is considered a supporter of socialism
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki samaajawaadee ;vabapansapereddh shabd kaa pehla prayog usee ne kiya tha
 But Marxist thinkers view Owen's campaign with suspicion
 swayan fradrik anglas ne oven kii niyat par andeh karte hue use ek tarah se chhadam samaajawaadee sweekaar kiya he
 According to the Angles- pramaan ke liye anglas ne ek oven kii ek ukti kaa ullekh apane lekh main kiya he, jisase oven kaa dambh jhalkata he
 Owen wisely, it was said that he had given some facilities to the laborers, while introducing professional skills
 use badale main jo prapti hui, vah kiye gaye kharch se kai guna thi
 Taking this example from Owen's literature, Fredrik Angles explains that- abir abraar ek adaakara he Chhatrasal was a formidable warrior of medieval India who fought with the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb and established his kingdom in Bundelkhand and attained the title of 'maharaja'
 bundelkhand main kai pratapi shaasha hue hai
 Chhatrasal, the son of Champatarai, who laid the foundation stone of the Bundela kingdom, was a great knight and majestic king
 chhatrasaal kaa jivan mughalon kii satta ke khilaaf sangharsh or bundelkhand kii swatantraaa sthapit karne ke liye jujhate hue niklaa
 Maharaja Chhatrasal struggled with invasions till the end of his life
 bundelkhand keshari ke naam se vikhyath maharaja chhatrasaal ke bare main ye panktiyaan bahut prabhaavshaalee he: When Champatarai was facing the struggle for life and death in the land, on the same day Jyeshtha Shukla 3 Samvat 1707, history-man Chhatrasal was born in the Peacock Hills of Vindhya forests near Kakar Kachhane village under the Lighora development block of present Tikamgarh district
 
 apane parakramee pita chanpatrai kii mrityu ke samay ve maatr 12 varsh ke hi the
 Born in the lap of the forestland, grew up in the shadow of the forest gods, this hero originated from Vanraj amidst cannon, sword and blood flow
 paanch varsh main hi inhen yuddh kaushal kii shiksha hetu apane mamaa sahebsingh dhandher ke paas delvaara bhej diya gaya tha
 Shortly after the parents' demise, he moved to Devgarh with elder brother Angad Rai
 baad main apane pita ke vachan ko puraa karne ke liye chhatrasaal ne panvar vansh kii kanya devkuri se vivaah kiya
 a 12-13-year-old boy who had lost his traditional fiefdom due to power-rich enemies at the time of opening his eyes, due to the betrayal of his near and dear ones, whose brave parents committed suicide, who did not have any military force or money power
 Can you imagine the mood? But he had the rites of Bundeli Shaurya, the indomitable courage of the brave mother-figure and the deep confidence of 'veer Vasundhara'
 isliye vah tutaa nahin, duba nahin, aatmghaat nahin kiya varan ek rasta nikaala
 He reached his father's friend Raja Jai singh with his brother, enlisting in the army and started taking modern military training
 raja jaisingh to dilli sultanate ke liye kaary kar rahe the atah aunrgazeb ne jab unhen dakshin vijay kaa kaary saunpa to chhatrasaal ko isi yuddh main apni bahaduree dikhaane kaa pehla avasar mila
 In 1665, Chhatrasal showed extraordinary gallantry in the Bijapur war and Chhatrasal fought hard to defeat the Gonda king of Deogarh
 is seemaa tak ki yadi unka ghoda, jise baad main ‘bhalebhai’ ke naam se vibhooshit kiya gayounki raksha na karata to chhatrasaal shaayad jivit na bachate par itane par bhi jab vijayshri kaa sehara unke sir par na baandh mughal bhai-bhatijevad main bant gaya to chhatrasaal kaa swabhimaan aahat hua or unhone mughalon kii badaniyati samaj dilli sultanate kii sena chhod di
 These days the star of Chhatrapati was shining on the sky of nationalism
 chhatrasaal dukhi to the hi, unhone chhatrapati shivaji maharaj se milanaa hi in paristhitiyon main uchit samajha or san 1668 main donon rashtraveeron kii jab bhent hui to chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ne chhatrasaal ko unke uddeshyon, gunon or paristhitiyon kaa abhas karaate hue swatantra rajya sthapana kii mantranaa di
 Chhatrasal returned to his motherland in 1670 after taking the mantra of Swaraj from Shivaji, but the conditions of the then Bundel land were completely miserable
 adhikash riyasatdar mughalon ke manasabadaar the, chhatrasaal ke bhai-bandhu bhi dilli se bhidane ko taiyaar nahin the
 They had nothing in their hands
 datia naresh shubhakaran ne chhatrasaal kaa sammaan to kiya par badshaah se bair na karne kii hi salaah di
 Orchhesh Sujan Singh did Abhishek but stayed away from the struggle
 chhatrasaal ke bade bhai ratanshah ne saath dena sweekaar nahin kiya tab chhatrasaal ne raajaaon ke bajaay janonmukhi hokar apana kaary prarambh kiya
 It is said that his childhood companion Mahabali Teli returned his inheritance as a small ancestral property, so that Chhatrasal prepared a small army of 5 cavalry and 25 Paalas in the auspicious time of Jyeshtha Sudi Panchami Sunday v
 1728
 Playing the bugle of rebellion against Aurangzeb, he pioneered the establishment of Swaraj
 aurangzeb chhatrasaal ko parajeet karne main safal nahin ho paaya
 He sent a force of 30,000 troops under the leadership of Randoolah to chase Chhatrasal with the Mughal chieftains
 chhatrasaal apane rankaushal va chhapamar yuddh niti ke bal par mughalon ke chakke chhudaata rahaa
 Chhatrasal knew that the Mughal was a master at siege
 unke pita chanpatrai mughalon se dhokhaa kha chuke the
 Chhatrasal fought the Mughal army at several places including Etawah, Khimlasa, Gadhakota, Dhamouni, Ramgarh, Kanjia, Madido, Rahli, Rangiri, Shahgarh, Vansakala
 chhatrasaal kii shakti badhati gayi
 Chhatrasal recovered imprisonment from the Mughal chieftains who were imprisoned and freed him
 bundelkhand se mughalon kaa ecchhatra shashan chhatrasaal ne samaapt kar diya
 Chhatrasal had huge public support due to Chhatrasal's national love, valor and Hinduism
 chhatrasaal ne ek vishaal sena taiyaar kar lee
 It had 72 chief chieftains
 vasia ke yuddh ke baad mughalon ne chhatrasaal ko 'raja' kii manyata pradaan kii thi
 After that Chhatrasal also won the 'fort of Kalinjar' and declared Mandhata Chaubey as the fortress
 chhatrasaal ne 1678 main panna main rajdhani sthapit kii
 Chhatrasal was crowned in 1744 under the direction of Yogiraj Prannath
 chhatrasaal ke shaury or parakram se aahat hokar mogul sardaar tahavar khaan, anwar khaan, saharudin, hamid bundelkhand se dilli kaa rukh kar chuke the
 Bahlod Khan was killed in a fight with Chhatrasal
 muraad khaan, daleh khaan, saiyad afgan jaise sipahsalaar bundela veeron se parajeet hokar bhaag gayi the
 Chhatrasal's Guru Prannath kept giving messages of hindu-muslim unity for life
 unke dwaara diye gayi upadesh 'kuljam swaroop' main ekatra kiye gayi
 There is a tomb of Prannath in Panna which is a pilgrimage site for the followers
 prannath ne is anchal ko ratnagarbha hone kaa vardaan diya tha
 Legend has it that as far as the footsteps of Chhatrasal's horse's footsteps became, the Dhanadhanya, the jewel, was completed
 chhatrasaal ke vishaal rajya ke vistaar ke bare main yah panktiyaan gaurav ke saath dohraayi jaati he- 'it yamuna ut narmada it chambal ut tose chhatrasaal son laran kii rahi na kahuhaus
 'chhatrasal was a great knight, organizer, skilled and majestic king of his time
 chhatrasaal ko apane jivan kii sandhya main bhi akramanon se jujhna pada
 In 1729, during the reign of Emperor Muhammad Shah, the Subedar Bangas of Prayag attacked Chhatrasal
 uski ichha erch, konch, seveda, sopri, jalon par adhikaar kar lene kii thi
 Datia, the kings of Sehuda did not cooperate in helping Chhatrasal fight the Mughals
 unka putr hridayshah bhi udasin hokar apni jaagir main baitha rahaa
 Then Chhatrasal sent a message to Bajirao Peshwa - bajirao sena sahit sahaayta ke liye pahunchaa or usne bangas ko 30 march 1729 ko parajeet kar diya
 Bangus returned after losing

 War and Peace is a novel by the famous Russian writer Lev Tolstoy
 yah pehali baar 1869 main prakashit hua tha
 It is a huge work and is counted among the greatest works of world literature
 'yuddh or shaanti' kaa lekhan tolastoy ne 1863 i0 se 1869 i0 ke bich kiya
 Its publication began in 1865
 chaar khandon main prakashit is upanyaas kii prishth sankhya lagbhag dedh hajaar thi
 This large novel was conceived in about 15 different forms
 anek adhyay kai-kai baar badale gayi or naye sire se likhe gayi
 There are hundreds of characters in this novel and there are so many incidents and so many subtexts that are well connected with the main plot, that the reader is left wondering how the writer has absorbed them all with such artistic skill
 yadhyapi is viraat upanyaas kaa taana-bana bolconski, rostov or bezurov kulanaamon vaale kuleen pariwaron tathaa nepolian bonapart or samraat alexandra pratham ke samay kii ghatnaon ke ird-gird buna gaya he, tathaapi yah 19veen shatabdi ke purvarddh, bhudaason kii mukti ke pehle ke rus kaa ek jeeta jaagta chitra prastut karata he
 In this great novel, political, diplomatic, social, religious, philosophical, social, mental-emotional and psychological, etc
 No aspect or part of life has remained untouched
 is upanyaas main tolastoy ne roosi itihaas ke us kaal ko centre-bindu banaate hue yah dikhaane kaa praytn kiya he ki saadhaaran roosi logon kii deshbhakti, saahas, veerta or dridhtaa ne kaise nepolian or uski sarvatra jeet kaa danka bajaane vaali sena ke chakke chhudaa diye
 This was Tolstoy's more comprehensive view of history
 unhone yah spasht karnaa chaha he ki yuddh kaa saare samaaj, jivan ke sabhi pakshon, sabhi virgon or shreniyon ke logon par kya prabhaav padataa he
 For this reason, some of Tolstoy's scholars believe that Tolstoy in the original Russian word synonymous with peace, not Tolastoy, means peace, but the people or the whole society
 is mat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is upanyaas kaa naam vastutah 'yuddh or shanti' nahin balki 'yuddh or samaaj' hona chahie
 'war and peace' is considered not only the world's greatest novel but a phenomenon in literary history
 yah ek sanjtil, aitihaasik-manovaigyanik, bahusanstareey mahakavyatmak kalatmak sanrachana he
 Generally, efficient synthesis of three types of materials has been done in it: - inke sahaayak pahaluon ke rup main parivaar, vivaah, striyon kii sthiti, kulinon ke nissar, janvimukh, pakhandpurn jivan aadi par tolastoy ke vichaar or maujuud sthiti kii prakhar aalochana bhi kahani ke saath hi gunthi-buni prastut hoti chalati he
 The skill with which the novel is presented in the novel, along with the detailed historical details and psychological depths, and the essayistic presentation of his ideas about history-philosophy, is unique and astonishing
 roosi lekhak evan turgnev ne 1880 main likhaa tha :-"yah viraat upanyaas vir 'mahakavy ke samaan he
 It portrays the personal and social life of the early years of our century with great efficiency

 yah mahaan lekhak kii mahaan rachana he -- yah asli rus he
 " charles persi snow kaa maananaa he-- "tolastoy ek mahanatam upanyaaskaar hai or 'yuddh or shaanti' ab tak likhe gayi upanyaason main sarvshereshth he
 " angrej lekhak jon galsvardi ne 'yuddh or shaanti' ko ab tak rachaa gaya shreshthatam upanyaas kaha he
 Renowned French writer Romain Rolland wrote that the composition "has neither beginning nor end as life
" yah to shaashvat gatishiltaa main swayan jivan he
 "he has considered this book to be" a grand 19th century monument, its crown "
 roosi lekhak evan goncharov kii manyata he : " 'yuddh or shaanti' vishay vastu or rachana shilp donon hi drushtiyon se ek adbhut mahakavyatmak upanyaas he
 It is also a glorious Russian era monumental history in which every character is either a historical figure or similar to a bronze sculpture

 " francisi lekhak francwa moriak is upanyaas se is had tak prabhavit the ki unhone likhaa he :- "main yah nahin kah saktaa ki maine 'yuddh or shaanti' ko padhaa he
 In fact, i have been breathing for the most part of my youth among the characters of this novel

 Tolstoy's genius particularly astonishes my imagination to enliven an entire historical era in 'war and Peace', as well as the fate of Russia far beyond the boundaries of that era by the images of its characters in this novel
 Has also been echoed
 " Ernest Hemengué says - "in my eyes, there is no writer who wrote better about the war than Tolsoy

 In computer science, polymorphism is a feature of the programming language that helps handle different types of data using the same interface
 paramitric polymorfijmaki avadharana data ke prakaar or function donon par lagu hoti he
 a function that can evaluate or apply to different types of values is called a polymorphic function

 {0 {1}} Using parametric polymorphism, a function or data type can be written generically so that it can handle the value evenly, regardless of the type of the value
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek function apend jo do soochiyon ko jodta he, uskaa nirmaan is tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he ki ise tatv ke prakaar se koi fark nahin padataa: yah purnankon kii suchi ko, vaastavik sankhyaon kii suchi ko, shrinkhalaa kii suchi ko or is prakaar se kai anya soochiyon ko sanlagn kar saktaa he
 Suppose the type variable in this list represents the type of an element
 tab apend ko × → rup main tip kiya ja saktaa he, jahaan prakaar a ke tatwon kii suchi ko nirupit karata he
 We say that the type of append is parametricized by a for all values of a
 har sthaan ke liye jahaan apend lagu kiya jaataa he, a ke liye ek maan ko nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 Parametric polymorphism was first introduced in 1976 to programming languages in ML
 vartmaan main yah standard ML, ocaml, Ada, Haskell, C++, vijual prolog or anya main maujuud he
 Java, c # , Visual Basic 
NET and Delphi each recently introduced "generics" for parametric polymorphisms
 polymorfijmaka sabase saamaanya rup "ucch shrenee kii impradikative polymorfism " he
 Two popular restrictions of this form are restricted rank polymorphism) and predictive polymorphism
 saath hi, ye pratibandh "predikative prinex polymorfism " dete hai, jo aavashyak rup se ML or hascale ke praarambhik sanskarnon main paayi jane vaali polymorfijmaka rup he
 In a prinex polymorphic system, the type variable cannot be instantiated by a polymorphic type
 yah "ml-style " yaa "let-polymorfism " ke bahut samaan he hote he)
 This restriction makes the distinction between polymorphic and non-polymorphic types very important; Thus polymorphic types in predicative systems are sometimes referred to as type schemas to differentiate them from normal types, these homologous types are sometimes called monotypes
 ek parinaam yah he ki sabhi prakaaron ko ek rup main likhaa ja saktaa he, jo sabhi kwantifyres ko sabase bahari sthiti main rakhata he
 For example, consider the ape function described above, which has type × →; To apply this function to a pair of lists, a type must be substituted for the variable a in the type of the function, the type of the argument matching the resulting function type, in an implicit system, to be replaced
 The type can be any type that includes a type that is itself polymorphic; Thus append can be applied to a pair of lists containing any type of elements - even to a list of polymorphic functions such as append
 bhashaa ML or iske nikat sambandhiyon main polymorfigmpradikative he
 The reason for this is that Predictivity, along with other restrictions, makes the type system so simple that type inference becomes possible
 bhashaaon main jahaan bahurupi function ko lagu karte samay spasht prakaar ke anotesan aavashyak hai predikativity pratibandh kam mahatvapurn hai; is prakaar se ye bhashaaen saamanyatya im predikative hoti hai
 Haskell achieves type findings without prediabetes
 k ke kisi nishchit maan ke liye, rank-k polymorfismek pranali he jisamen ek kwantifire k ero se adhik ke baayin or prakat nahin ho saktaa 
 For rank-2 polymorphisms, type re-designation can be determined, but rank-3 and above cannot be re-named
 rank-n polymorfismek aisi polymorfijmahai jisamen kwanti fyres kai yadricchhik ero ke baayin or prakat hote hai
 In a predictive parametric polymorphic system, a type τ { \ displaystyle \ tau} \ tau consisting of a type variable α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} \ alpha cannot be used in such a way that α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} \ alpha allows for a polymorphic type to be inset
 ise pratham shrenee kii polymorfismakaha jaataa he
 Impressive polymorphism helps in the integration of a variable into a type τ { \ displaystyle \ tau} \ tau from any type, including polymorphic types such as τ { \ displaystyle \ tau} \ tau
 prakaar siddhant main, sabase zyada adhyayan kiye jane vaale impradikative prakaar λ-kelkuli lembada ghan vishesh rup se pranali epa par aadhaarit hai
 Predie cative type theories include the martin-löf type theory and nuprl
 cardeli or veganar ne prakaar perometer par bandh kii anumati ke laabhon ko 1985 main pahachaanaa
 kai gatividhiyon ke liye data prakaar ke kuch gyaan kii zarurat hoti he, lekin ye phir bhi paramitric rup se kaam kar sakate hai
 For example, to check whether an item is included in a list, we have to compare the items for similarity
 maanak ML main, rup ’’a ke prakaar parameter pratibandhit hote hai jisase samanta kii kriyavidhi uplabdh ho jaati he, is prakaar se function main prakaar ’’a × ’’a list → bool hoga or ’’a keval paribhashit samanta se yukt ek prakaar ho saktaa he
 In Haskell, bonding is achieved by the types required to belong to a type class; Thus in a similar function in Haskell, type e q α ⇒ α → → b ool { \ displaystyle { \ scriptstyle Eq \ , \ alpha \ , \ rightarrow \ alpha \ , \ rightarrow \ left \ rightarrow Bool}} { \ scriptstyle Eq \ , \ alpha \ , \ Rightarrow \ alpha \ , \ rightarrow \ left \ rightarrow Bool}
 adhikansh object orionted programing bhashaayen, jo paramitric polymorfijmaka samarthan karti hai, unamem paramiters ko ek die gaye prakaar ke sabatip banane ke liye vivash kiya ja saktaa he
 Some languages provide subtype ideas to restrict the range of types that can be used in a particular case of parametric polymorphism
 in bhashaaon main, sabatyping polymorfism kaha jaataa he), ek vishesh prakaar t ke object ko lene ke liye ek function ko likhane main madad karti he, lekin thik prakaar se kaary bhi karti he yadi prakaar s se sambandhit object ko paas kiya jaye jo t kaa sabatip he 
is prakaar ke sambandh ko kabhi kabhi s s ke rup main likhaa jaataa he
 For example, if numbers, proportionals and integers are such that numbers:> proportionals and numbers:> integers, a function written for a number will function as well as when passing a number like a Must be passed to integer or proportional
 The actual type of the object can be hidden from the customer in a black box and is available through Object Identity
 vastav main, yadi sankhya kaa prakaar ebstract he, yah asambhav ho saktaa he ki aap apane haath ho us object par rakh paayen jiskaa sarvaadhik-vyutpann prakaar sankhya he 
 Object-oriented programming languages introduce subtyping polymorphisms using subclasses
 praroopik kriyanvayan main, prayek varg main ek virtual teble shaamil hoti he-yah functionon kii ek teble he jo varg interphes ke bahurupi hisse ko kriyanvit karti he-or prayek object main iske varg ke "ve teble " ke liye ek poinater shaamil hota he, iskaa upyog tab kiya jaataa he jab kabhi bahurupi vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This system is an example of the following: vahi adhikansh anya lokapriy object pranaaliyon ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 Some, however, such as CLOS provide multiple transmissions, under which method calls are polymorphic in all arguments
 strechi ne shabd tadarth polymorfism kaa chayan un bahurupi functionon ke sandarbh main kiya jinhen bhinn prakaar ke tarkon par lagu kiya ja saktaa he, lekin jo us tark ke aadhaar par bhinn prakaar se vyavhaar karte hai, jinke liye unhen lagu kiya jaataa he 
 shabd "tadarth " is arth main apmanjanak nahin mana ja saktaa he; yah saadhaaran rup se is tathy se sambandhit he ki polymorfijmaka prakaar, prakaar pranali kaa ek mul gun nahin he
 Ad hoc polymorphism is a transmission system: control of motion is transmitted to a number of other functions through a function named, which does not require specifying the exact function to be called
 overloding, samaan naam se paribhaashit kiye jane vaale bhinn prakaaron ko lene main ekaadhik functionon kii madad karti he; compiler yaa interprator swatah hi sahi vaale ko kol karata he
 In this way, the list of integers that expect functions, the list of real numbers, and lists of such types can be written and all are called as requisitions — and the right append function will be named based on the type to be appended
 This is different from parametric polymorphism in that functions must be written generically, so that functions can be performed with any type of list
 Using overloading, it is possible to get a function that can do two completely different things depending on the type of input to be passed to it; This is not possible with parametric polymorphisms
 overloding ko dekhne kaa ek or tarika he ki ek routine ko adwitiya rup se iske naam se nahin pahachaanaa jaataa, balki iske naam or sankhya, iske paramiters ke prakaar or kram ke sangyojan dwaara pahachaanaa jaataa he
 This type of polymorphism is common in object-oriented programming languages, many of which allow operators to be overloaded in a function-like manner
 Some languages that are not typed dynamically and lack ad hoc polymorphisms Function names are long such as print_int, print_string, etc
 It can be seen as a gain or loss depending on one's point of view
 ek phayda jo kabhi kabhi overloding se hota he vah he vishishtikaran kaa swarup, udhaaharan, ek samaan naam se yukt function ko kai alag alag tareekon se kriyanvit kiya ja saktaa he, inamen se prayek vishisht data prakaar ke liye anukulit hota he, jis par yah kaary karata he
 This can provide a convenient interface for the code that needs to be specialized in multiple conditions for performance reasons
 kyonki overloding compyle ke samay kii jaati he, yah let binding ke liye vikalp nahin he jaisaa ki sabatyping polymorfigmamen paaya gaya he
 In addition to the methods described in the previous section, there are other ways in which ad hoc polymorphism can work
 yah program ke sankalan ke baad rantime par hota he
 Therefore, polymorphism, like other languages, is given by subtyping polymorphisms and is also extended in functionality by ad hoc polymorphisms at run time
 lekin nikat se dekhne par yah bhi pataa chalegaa ki small taak tadarth polymorfijmaki ek alag kism uplabdh karata he
 Since smalltalk has a delayed implementation model and since it gives objects the ability to handle messages that are not understood, editing the functionality using polymorphism without explicitly overloading a particular message It is possible to do and move forward
 sambhavatya dainik programing ke liye aamtaur par isaki salaah nahin di jaati he, lekin proxij ke kriyavayan ke samay yah bahut upyogi ho sakati he
 In addition, while common class methods and constructor overloading in general terms are not considered polymorphisms, there are also more flat languages, in which classes are regular objects
 small taak main, udhaaharan ke liye, varg niyamit objects hai
 In turn, this means that messages sent to classes can be overloaded and it is also possible to create objects that behave like classes without getting their classes from the hierarchy of classes
 These are effective techniques that can be used to leverage the powerful reflection capabilities of small talk
 isi prakaar kii vyavasthaayen self or neuspik jaisi bhashaaon main bhi sambhav hai
 The goal of this example is to give an example of three different types of polymorphism described in this article
 Although overloading is basically an arithmetic operator that performs many types of work, thus it may not be the most obvious example, it does offer some subtle points
 vyavhaar main, polymorfismake vibhinn prakaaron ko aam taur par us tarah se mishrit nahin kiya jaataa he jitna ki yahaan kiya gaya he
 Imagine an operator + which can be used in the following ways: in chah function colls ko hendal karne ke liye, code ke chaar alag tukdon kii zarurat hoti he- yaa teen kii yadi shrinkhalaaon ko aksharon kii suchi mana gaya ho
 Thus, name + actually refers to three or four completely different functions
 yah overloding kaa ek udhaaharan he
