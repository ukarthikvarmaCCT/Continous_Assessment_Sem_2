 Reconciliation proved impossible, and Waugh filed for divorce in September 1929
 saath hi, wa nirdesh se guzar rahaa tha jisane sitambar 1930 main roman catholic girjaghar main apana swaagat kiya
 Waugh's adherence to Catholic education on divorce caused disappointment while awaiting the possible annulment of their marriage
 unhone terresa jangamain, ek jeevant soshlite jiskaa roman catholic isai carch wa kii aankhon main ke baad se unke rishte main kisi bhi antarangta roka shaadi bane rahe ke saath pyaar main gir gaya tha
 Waugh's adaptations did not greatly affect the bitterness of his own and the increasingly sarcastic tone of the narrative — his leading characters were often unsympathetic and his movements sometimes shocking
 wa ne daawa kiya he "is tarah ke ek fishan main aadmi kii bhrashtataa ke likhane ke liye ke rup main yah badsoorat karne kaa adhikaar"
 When Black Mischief was published in 1932, the editor of the Catholic magazine The Tablet, Ernest Oldmeadow, launched a violent attack on the book and its author, stating that the novel was "an insult to anyone claiming a Catholic name"
 wa, oldmado likhaa tha, "na keval catholic ke liye, lekin namrata ke saath saadhaaran maanakon ke apmanjanak ek kaam vyakhya karne par amada tha"
 Waugh made no public denial of these allegations; An open letter was prepared to the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, but was not sent on the advice of Waugh's friends

 His decision to absent himself might have been a reaction to his increasingly complex emotional life; While his passion for Teresa Jungman remained insufficient, he was involved in various unsatisfactory casual sexual relationships, and was being pursued by the much older Hazel Lavery himself

 The two enjoyed an agreeable dinner together, where Christy spoke of the "fifth Empire"
 unhone vau se kaha ki unhone swarg main santon kii puri sabha ko dekha he-ascharyajanak rup se kuch, unhone kaha- lekin unhen ginana nahin tha kyonki ve avibhajya the
 Waugh added Christie to his "treasures of eccentricity", set aside for future literary use

 Days of inaction and boredom followed, "nothing to read except a few lives of saints in the sermons of French and Bosquet"
 wa ne kuch samay ek choti si kahani likhakar paarit kiya; haalanki diary main pahachaanaa nahin gaya he, is kahani ko aam taur par "da main hu liked dicans" ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The story is very similar to the episode except for using different names and some minor details that Waugh later uses at the climax of a Handful of Dust: an elderly settler, rescues and captives the Lost Explorer and her Forever, Dickens' novels need to be read aloud
 yah kahani 1933 main america main harsts international-cosmopolitan main or naish ke pal mal patrika main britain main prakashit hui thi
 In an article written several years later, Waugh explained how the story became the basis for his next novel: "the idea came quite naturally from the experience of visiting a lone settler 


 and showing how easily He could hold me prisoner
 phir, choti kahani likhi or prakashit hone ke baad, vichaar mere dimag main kaam kar rahaa tha
 i wanted to find out how the prisoner got there, and eventually the thing grew into another kind of cruel study of helpless plight between home and civilized man

 By 10 February that half-waypoint had reached 45,000 words — but it was uncertain how the story should proceed, and returned to England at the end of February, with the second half unannounced

 Because the episode "mr

 In his study of Waugh's literary life, David Wax describes a Handful of Dust as "a daring and masterful act of fictional autobiography inspired by the trauma of the author's divorce," without which Wix says the book Was not written wa unke jeevani lekhak martin stanerd kehete hai, "vivaah vivaah ke tuutane ko dastavej karne main" apni vyaktigat pidaa kii yaaddaasht "kar rahe the
 Critic Cyril Connolly, whose first reaction to the work was negative, later called it "the only book" that realizes the true horror of withdrawing affection in relation to the innocent party's point of view

 Brenda is portrayed in the novel, as do many of Waugh's early stories of women as well as bred, despised, and faithless — but Wykes argues that she does not represent Evelyn Gardner, "neither within nor Only external qualities "

 Refers to Roth, who Waugh believed to be involved in the wilderness, only to dissolve it from Roth's report of irresponsibility and disregard of danger

 Therese announces her destiny to marry a wealthy Catholic, and, in an echo of the jungleman, departs Tony when she discovers that he still has a wife

 All these have no place in the common man's century where the vice president no longer pays the virtuous service
 " Critics and commentators have generally accepted that a Handful Dust is different from Waugh's other predecessors

 Similarly reviewing the book's initial publication in 1934, Gerald Gould in The Observer, "here was the old grand, careless note of contempt and confusion
 dhire-dhire, dhyaan main parivartan or gaharaai hui"
 Later critic, John Cunningham, stylistically, recognizes the book as both more ambitious and more ambiguous, in a category different from Waugh's other 1930 novels
 yadhyapi, kaningham kehete hai, " tii wash ke anya santon ke rup main zyada jaanboojhkar hansi ko uttejit karata he", yah catholic "uddhaar kii kamedis" kii ore apane purvavartiyon se ek mahatvapurn kadam he jo unke lekhan kaa mukhya centre ban jayega jindagi
 In an introduction to the 1997 Penguin edition, Robert Murray Davis suggested that the book, in part, reflected Waugh's reconsideration of his status as a Catholic writer, most recently in light of the Oldmeadow furore on the Black Mischief
 unhone us timahi se aage kii aalochana ko purvavat karne ke liye ek or gambhir swar viksit kiya hoga, haalanki stanerd ne kaha he ki 1929 main jab ve vil body puraa kar rahe the, to ek gambhir lekhak ke rup main vaagh kii shuruyaat hui thi
 Waugh's own comment, in 1946, was that he was not a "sarcastic" writer, according to his understanding of the term, and in writing the book he was merely "trying to overcome comedy and sometimes out of displeasure" Outside behavior of distant tragedy people "
 pustak ke pehle prakaashan ke baad da spectrator main likhane vaale wiliam plomar ne sochaa ki "shri vaagh kii ascharyajanak yaa dur-daraaj ke rup main or adhik ascharyajanak paristhitiyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, ve puri tarah yathartwaadee hai"
 However, the mixing of genres was not immediately understood or appreciated by some Swan fans; Connolly's initial idea was that Waugh was "destroyed as a writer", out of nervousness and association with country-house living
 cics ke vichaar main, vaagh kii doordaraj kii duniya, jaise ki ladi metroland ke paatro kii pustak main bede kii upasthiti ajeeb or ghuspaith kar rahi he- e handphul of dust kii duniya anjaan nahin he: "evalin ladi metroland ko bhul gaye the or uski duniya puri tarah se "
 After Cunningham Waugh, a handful sees dust as a precursor to Catholic novels
 england ke carch ke liye wa ke barkhaast ravaiye ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, anglikanwaad ko ek faras ke rup main dikhaaya gaya he ,yaa ek morrkhtaa 
 Instead, Christianity develops by presenting the horrors of life without it; According to writer and critic Frank Kermode, "the melancholy of the event and the coolness of the tone work by suggesting a positive and rational declaration of faith"
 pathak, stanerd kehete hai, "kabhi bhi manushya kii praarambhik pashaviktaa ko bhuulane kii ijaajat nahin he 


 ishwar vah kunjee he jise is puri tarah se dharmanirpeksh duniya main phenk diya gaya he"
 John Raymond in The New Statesman refers to Waugh's "peculiar kind of moral vision", and calls the novel "powerful twentieth-century discourse on the breakdown of Christian marriage"
 brazil ke jangal main tony kii barbaad khoj bible ke shabdon main banaai gai he; praasangik adhyay sheershak, "ek shahar kii khoj main" ibraniyon 13:14 ko bataata he: "yahaan hamaare paas koi nirantar shahar nahin he, lekin ham aane vaale vyakti kii talash karte hai"
 However, Waugh commented to the novel that it was "humanitarian" and said that i wanted to say "about humanity"
 unka maananaa tha ki aavashyak 20 veen shatabdi kaa sangharsh isai dharm or caos ke bich tha, or yah dikhaane ke liye ek arajak duniya prastut karnaa chunaa ki sabhyataa main khud ko jivit rahane kii shakti nahin thi
 Thus, in the Brazilian jungle, Tony confronts what Davis called "power without grace 


 secular feudalism deprived of Christianity's saving grace"
 tod maanavvaadi, adharmik shakti kaa pratik he
 Critic Bernard Bergonji refers to Tony Last as "a destructive Gothic hero", echoing Waugh's explanation for his friend Henry York that the subject of the book was "a gothic man in the hands of the uncivilized - first Mrs
 Beaver, etc
" , Then real people "
 stanerd ke mutabik, vaagh ne apni kala se sabhyataa kaa nyaay karne kaa prayaas kiya, or vishesh rup se isaki vaastukala ke dwaara, or angreji gothic upanyaas kaa ek pramukh litmotif he
 Tony's recognition of the extent of Branda's betrayal has been described as "the whole gothic world 


 comes grief"
 baad main, tony ko anyathaa vyarth yatra main uddeshy miltaa he jab vah messinger se laapata khoe shahar kii sunata he; vah ise charitra main gothic ke rup main dekhtaa he, "ek roopantarit heton 


 sabakuch chamakdaar or paardarshee; ek coral garh he jo dezi ke saath ek hare pahari kii chotii par chadhataa he"
 
 When at the end of his quest he first sees the settlement of Todd, he sees, in his confusion, the reality of the mud huts and destruction, rather than the "guild cupolas and spiers of alabaster"
 yadhyapi mul angreji gothic ko samarpit, vaagh ne gothic rivival architekchar par mishrit vichaaron ko pasand kiya tha, jise unhone 19veen shatabdi kii style ke baad "study" ke liye "pre-ruskin" kaha tha, jisamen unhone heton ko rakhaa tha
 He instructed the artist responsible for the frontispiece to illustrate the "worst possible 1860" style home in the first edition of the book
 duusare adhyay ko kholane vaale heton ke guidebuk vivaran se pataa chalata he ki, "pehle county ke ullekhneey gharon main se ek, ise puri tarah se gothic style main 1864 main punarnirmit kiya gaya tha or ab yah byaaj se rahit he"
 Thus, Tony's devotion is shown as a false ideal; His statement and replacement by middle-class heirs in his domain represents what author Brigid Brophy calls "the bourgeois useless of fake-gothic Rome"

 In private schools, by taking advantage of higher education and more educated unemployed, they continue to evaluate the student by taking weekly and monthly half-yearly tests with proper education, and if they fail in any assessment, they take them out

 There is no evaluation of the knowledge of the student, half of the names are evaluated, which are done by the teachers of the same school, and they pass the examiners to not let themselves fall in the eyes of the Principal

 Dhruva means 'fixed'
 dhruvit tarang main kisi simit rup main hi dolan hote hai jabaki adhruvit tarang main sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se dolan hota he
 The moving sound waves in a gas or liquid do not exhibit the properties of polarization because they have the same direction of motion and the direction of oscillation
 saadhaaran prakaash kii kiran sancharandisha ke saapeksh samamit hoti he, kintu vishesh avasthaaon main usamen asamamiti athwa ekapaksheeyata kaa gun utpann ho jaataa he
 This can be easily evidenced by a green natural crystal plaque called tourmaline
 jab saadhaaran prakaash is pattica main hokar nikalataa he, tab to pattica ke kiran ke aksh par ghumaane se kiran kii tivrata main koi parivartan nahin hota, kintu jab taramaileen main se nikali hui yah kiran tourmaileen kii waisi hi duusari pattica ko ghumaane se kiran kii tivrata main bahut adhik parivartan hota he
 The intensity is maximum when the axes of both tourmalines are parallel
 jyon-jyon in akshon ke bich kaa kone badhata jaataa he tyon-tyon tivrata ghatati jaati he or jab vah samakon ke baraabar ho jaataa he tab tivrata kaa maan shunya ho jaataa he
 It is clear that ascending from the first tourmaline, the light has produced such an asymmetry property that was not in ordinary light
 is gun kaa naam "dhruvan" he or is gunayukta prakaash ko "dhruvit" kehete hai
 From this point of view, ordinary light is called "overflow"
 vyatikaran tathaa vivartan kii ghatnaon ke dwaara spasht ho jaataa he ki dhwani kii tarah hi prakaash kaa sancharan bhi tarangon ke rup main hota he or is sancharan ke liye madhyam ke rup main ether naamak ek padaarth kii kalpana bhi kar lee gai he
 The above phenomenon of polarization proves that light waves are not as longitudinal as sound waves, as the above type of asymmetry is not possible due to the direction of vibration transmission in longitudinal waves
 at: prakaash tarangen anuprastha hoti hai, arthath unke kampan sitar ke taar ke companon kii tarah tarangasancharan se samakonik disha main hote hai
 It is not necessary that the vibrational path of the particle of the medium in the transverse wave is simply linear
 aavashyak itnaa hi he ki kampanpath us samtal main avasthit rahe jisapar tarangasancharan kii disha abhilamb rup ho
 Therefore, the shape of this vibrator can be elliptical and circular in special cases
 jis tarang main kampan kii akruti or yadi kampan saral rekhaatmak ho to uski disha, aparivartin rahati he, use dhruvit tarang kehete hai or jisamen yah akruti yaa disha badalati rahati he use adhruvit kehete hai
 In this view, polarized light can be of the following three types: 1
 samtal dhruvit 2
 Ellipse Polarized 3
 vrutt dhruvit 
 It is known from mathematical studies that these different shapes of vibrations are obtained by combining two right-angled simple periodic vibrations
 vipareetat: kampan kii akruti jo bhi ho, uske vighatan se do samakonik saral aavart kampan praapt ho sakate hai
 When the light enters a transparent crystal, such vibrations of its vibrations take place directly and two flat polar rays appear in the crystal
 inke kampan paraspar samakonik hote hai
 Generally they move in different directions and their velocities are not equal
 is ghatana kaa naam dwivartan he or isi ke dwaara higenz ne san 1960 main dhruvan kaa avishkaar kiya tha
 One of these two rays is absorbed into the crystal of tourmaline
 tourmaileen ke dwaara dhruvit prakaash kii utpatti kaa yahi kaaran he
 The direction of vibrations of this light depends on the direction of the crystalline axis of the tourmaline plate and rotating that plate also changes the direction of the vibrations
 kintu saadhaaran adhruvit prakaash main companon kii akruti athwa dish kshan-kshan main nirantar badalati rahati he, at: jab vah tourmaileen main se nikalataa he tab dhruvit prakaash kii tivrata bhi badalati to rahati he parantu uskaa ausat maan tourmaileen kii prayek sthiti main baraabar rahata he or yahi hamen dikhaai detaa he
 But when flat polarized light, which has amplitude, passes through the tourmaline, it remains polarized, but its amplitude decreases, where is the pointer angle of the position of the tourmaline
 q = 0 tab samajha jaataa he jab aayam mahattam hota he
 When q = 90 °, the amplitude becomes a = 0 and the transmitted light is lost, no matter how large the amplitude value of the incident light
 dirghavritt dhruvit prakaash ko bhi tourmaileen samtal dhruvit to kar detaa he or uski tivrata bhi tourmaileen ko ghumaane se badhati he, kintu uskaa purnat: lop kabhi nahin hota
 The reason for this is that this type of incident light consists of two components of mutually right, but different dimensions, and when one element is greatest in the case of q = 0, the other is lost and q = 90 degrees
 When the first dimension is omitted, the second dimension becomes the maximum
 vrutt dhruvit prakaash kii tivrata main tourmaileen kuch bhi parivartan nahin kar saktaa, kyonki iske donon avyav companon ke aayam baraabar hote hai arthath 
 Hence, it also has the property of symmetry like unfiltered light
 phir bhi yah dhruvit prakaash he
 The trick to identify it will be explained further
 isamen kampan saral rekhaatmak hote hai or unki disha achar rahati he
 Hence, it is also called line polarization
 samtal dhruvit naam kaa kaaran yah hai ki aise prakaash kii kiran ke samast vinduon ke kampan ek hi samtal main hote hai
 Other measures to generate flat polarized light are as follows: 1
 nikal prism - kailcite jaise crystal main vivartan to hota hai, kintu donon paraspar lambat: samtal dhruvit kirane itane paas-paas hoti hai ki unamem se keval ek ko praapt karnaa kathin he
 But the two prisms cut from the calcite special tip are connected to the Canadian balsam to form a parallel fruit prism, known as nickel prism
 isamen pravesh kar canada baalsam par pahunchne par ek kiran to purnat: paravartit hokar parshv main chali jaati he or vahaan nasht ho jaati he, kintu duusari kiran sidhi chalakar baahar nikalati he
 This prism is good transparent
 at: isse praapt samtal, dhruvit prakaash aaptit prakaash ke hi rang kaa hota he
 2
 Polaroid - In this, microscopic crystals of a mineral called hierapathite are deposited in a parallel position between the two planks of the celluloid in a special way, so that they can all work together to form one long broad crystal
 yah tourmaileen ke samaan hi samtal dhruvit prakaash utpann kar detaa he
 This is called a polyroid
 iske bahut lambey chaude takhte banaae ja sakate hai
 This color is light green
 san 1941 main isse bhi acchhee ek or yukti nikaal lee gai, jisase polivinil alcohol ke anuon ko samaantar sthiti main jamaa diya jaataa he
 This is called polyuroid-h
 isamen jaraa bhi rang nahin hota or 99
99 pratishat prakaash dhruvit ho jaataa he
 3
 Reflection - In 1810, Malus testified that the properties of polarization are found partially in the reflected light from the surface of a transparent material such as water or glass, and it becomes perfectly flat when the incidence angle is of particular value
 
 is aapatan kone ko "dhruvak kone" kehete hai
 According to Brewster's rule, if the polar angle is i and the reflector of the reflective material is m, then sp

 patticganj - yadhyapi kaach kii pattica se dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash purnat: dhruvit hota he, tathaapi us main se pargamit prakaash kabhi bhi purnat: dhruvit nahin hota, vah keval anshat: dhruvit hota he, kintu uttarottar anek patticoon main se pargamit prakaash kaa dhruvan uttarottar badhata jaataa he or patticoon kii sankhya paryaapt ho jane par vah lagbhag purnat: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he
 Such a group of many thin strips is called pattikapunj
 5
 prakirnan - jab prakaash kisi paardarshee madhyam main upasthit atyant chote-chote kanon par padataa he tab un kanon se prakirnit hokar chaaron ore failanevaala prakaash bhi saamanyat: anshadhruvit hota he
 But the light which is radiated in a right-angled direction from the primary ray is perfectly flat
 yah baat akaash ke nile prakaash main dekhi ja sakati he, jo vaayu ke anuon dwaara prakirnit surya kaa prakaash hi he
 Just as it is used to find out whether a light plane is polar or not and which is its polar surface, tourmaline is used, in the same way all the above mentioned means of generating polarization were also used for this purpose
 can go
 ise utpann karne kaa upaay yah he ki samtal dhruvit prakaash ko kisi dwivartak crystal, yatha abhrak kii pattica, par abhilambat: daalaa jaataa he
 This causes right-angled polar rays of two different dimensions to move in the crystal on the same path at different velocities
 usamen se duusari ore nikalne par in donon kirnon main kuch kalantar utpann ho jaataa he or donon ke sangyojan se dirghavritt dhruvit prakaash praapt ho jaataa he
 If the thickness of the crystal plaque is such that the time interval reaches 90 degrees, then the plate is called the quadrant wave plate
 is pattica ko ghumaane se ek kiran kaa aayam badhata he or duusari kaa ghatata he
 In the case where the two dimensions are equal, the transmitted light becomes circled
 aise dhruvanon kii pahchaan ke liye bhi chaturthaansh tarangapattica kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This decomposes the ellipsoidal or circular vibrations into two right-angled simple linear vibrations, and by rotating the fillet to the proper position, it reduces or increases their time point to 0 ° or 180 °
 at: pargamit prakaash pun: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he, jisaki pahchaan tourmaileen yaa nikal ke dwaara ho sakati he
 Flat polarized light cannot be obtained by this action from fractionated or depolarized light, because the fractionated light is a mixture of polar and flat polarized light and the tourmaline gate of the depolarized light can never be omitted
 samtal dhruvit prakaash main companon kii disha kaa gyaan hone kaa karna is disha kaa saket dene ke liye ek dhruvanatal kii kalpana kii gai thi or uski paribhaasha yon di gai thi : paravartan dwaara praapt purnat: samtal dhruvit kiran kaa dhruvanatal uskaa aayaat tal hota he
 Therefore, in the event of a tourmaline in which the intensity of this reflected ray is destroyed, a parallel line is drawn from the emergency floor on the tourmaline plate
 usamen tourmaileen pattica par apaat tal se samaantar rekha khinch lee jaati he or tab aise tourmaileen se kisi bhi dhruvit prakaash kaa dhruvanatal maaloom kiya ja saktaa he
 The simplest way to know this is to move a thin beam of polarized light flattened in a dark room in a vertical direction
 kiran kaa maarg adrishy hi rahegaa, kintu yadi bahut patale kanon kaa dhunaa, kaagaj ko jalaakar, is kiran ke nikat utpann kiya jaae to un kanon se prakirnit prakaash ke kaaran kiran kaa maarg dikhaai dene lagegaa
 But by looking around, the ray will remain invisible in one particular direction
 spashtat: is disha main prakirnan nahin hota
 Thus, this is the direction of vibration, because the transverse wave cannot move in the direction of vibration
 is upaay se gyaat ho gaya he ki kampan kii disha dhruvan tal se samakonik hoti he, arthath dhruvak kone par paravartit kiran ke kampan apaat tal se samakonik hote hai
 The same thing has been proved by other measures
 prakaash ke vidyut chumbakeey siddhant ke anusar prayek kiran main vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey donon prakaar ke kampan hote hai or ye paraspapar samakonik bhi hote hai
 This theory also shows that the electrical vibrations in the reflected light at the polar angle are equidistant from the emergency
 at: isse yah parinaam nikalataa he ki netron ko prabhavit karanevaale prakaash ke kampan vaidyut hai, chumbakeey nahin
 In light reflected at the polar angle, the vibrations of the vibrations are right-angled from the emergency plane, which obviously means that if the vibrations of the incident ray are in the emergency plane, its reflection will not be exactly at the polar angle
 at: jab aapatan kone dhruvak kone ke baraabar ho tab apattal main dhruvit prakaash kaa to paravartan ho saktaa he, kintu apattal se samakonat: dhruvit prakaash kaa paravartan nahin ho saktaa
 In geometry, it is necessary that the intensity of light can be reduced at will and also we can know accurately what is the ratio between this reduced intensity and the preceding intensity
 iske liye do nikal prismon kaa upyog kiya jaat he
 When both are in parallel phase, the intensity of the light passing through both of them progressively becomes the greatest, but if there is an angle between the positions of both, then the intensity decreases in proportion
 polaroid kaa bhi is kaary ke liye upyog kiy ja saktaa he

 He was the chief commander in Akbar's army
 unhone amer ke mukhya mahal ke nirmaan karaayaa
 The great historian Colonel James Tod has written- "mansingh, the heir of Bhagwan Das, was given the best position in the court of Akbar
 

maansingh ne urisa or assam ko jeet kar unako badshaah akbar ke adheen bana diya
 raja maansingh se bhaybheet ho kar kabul ko bhi akbar kii adheenta sweekaar kerani paddy thi
 As a result of these actions, Mansingh was appointed as the ruler of Bengal, Bihar, South and Kabul
 " When Akbar's general Man Singh Solapur was returning after conquering Maharashtra, Mansingh thought of meeting Pratap
 pratap us vaqt kumbhalgarh main the
 Maharana Pratap had to manage his welcome on the sails of Udaisagar in Udaipur after passing his kingdom within Mewar
 After the reception and mutual interaction, it was time for lunch
 maharaja maansingh bhojan ke liye aaye kintu maharana ko na dekh kar aashcharya main pad gayi
 When he asked Maharana's son Amarsingh for this reason, he told that 'maharana saheb has a headache, so he is unable to support you on food
 ' According to some historians, this incident also became the reason for the battle of Haldi valley
 akbar ko rana pratap ke is vyavhaar ke kaaran mewar par akraman karne kaa ek or mauka mil gaya
 In 1576 AD, he was set on a campaign to punish Maharana Pratapsingh
 mughalon kii vishaal sena tiddi dal kii tarah mewar kii ore umad padi
 It also had Akbar's tremendous artillery with Mughal, Rajput and Pathan warriors

 Rana Pratap fought that huge Mughal army with a handful of soldiers
 haldi ghati kii pili bhoomi raktranjit ho uthi
 On June 21, 1576 AD, seventeen thousand soldiers were killed in this fierce battle of one day between Pratap and the Mughal army in the Haldi valley near Gogunda
 yaheen rana pratap or maansingh kaa aamanaa-saamana hone par donon ke bich vikat yuddh hua - chetak kii peeth par savaar pratap ne akbar ke senapati maansingh ke hathi ke mastak par kaale-nile rang ke, arabi nasl ke ashv chetak ke paanv jamaa die or apane bhaale se sidhaa raja maansingh par ek pralayankari waar kiya, par tatkaal apane hathi ke majboot haude main chipak kar neeche baith jane se is yuddh main unki jaan batch gayi- houdah pratap ke durgharsh waar se buree tarah mud gaya
 Later, when Rana Pratap went away from the battleground of Haldighati on serious injuries, King Mansingh reached his palace and sent one of Pratap's famous elephant elephant Ramprasad to agra-darbar with other loot
 parantu maansingh ne chittorgarh ke nagar ko luutane kii ajna nahin di thi, yah jaan kar badshaah akbar in par kaaphi kupit hua or kuch vaqt ke liye darbar main inke aane par pratibandh tak laga diya
 In the words of James Todd- "in the days when Akbar was horribly ill and feared to die, Mansingh Khusro had laid a web of conspiracies to place him on the Mughal throne
 

uski yah cheshtaa darbar main sab ko gyaat ho gayi or vah bengal kaa shaasha bana kar bhej diya gaya
 After he left Khusro was imprisoned and kept in prison
 maansingh chatur or doordarshee tha
 He secretly supported Khusro
 Mansingh had an army of twenty thousand Rajputs under his control

 kuch itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he- "akbar ne das karod rupee de kar maansingh ko apane anukool bana liya tha
 " akbar shashan main jab raja bhagwantdas punjab ke soobedaar niyat hue, tab sindh ke paar seemaant praant kaa shashan unke kunwar maansingh ko diya gaya
 When Akbar's half-brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim died in his 30th year, Mansingh swiftly arrived in Kabul and got the residents there to get rid of the looting that followed the demise of the ruler and his sons Mirza Afrasiyab and Mirza Kankuvad of the kingdom
 He came to the court with other warlords

 raja bhagavaandas kii mrityu ho jane par raja maansingh jaipur ke singhaasana par baitha
 karnal james tod ne likhaa he- "maansingh ke shasankaal main amer rajya ne badi unnati kii
 mogul darbar main sammanit ho kar maansingh ne apane rajya kaa vistaar kiya usne anek rajyon par akraman kar ke jo aparimit sampatti luti thi, uske dwaara amer rajya ko shaktishaalee bana diya
 dhaularai ke baad amer, jo ek maamuli rajya samajha jaataa tha, maansingh ke samay vahi ek shaktishaalee or vistrut rajya ho gaya tha
 In the history of India, the Kachhwahs were not considered as knights, but during the time of King Bhagwan Das and Mansingh, the Kachwaha people showed their strength, might and glory from Khutan to the sea
 maansingh yon akbar kii adheenta main zarur tha, par uske saath kaam karne vaali rajput sena, badshaah kii sena se kahin adhik shaktishaalee samajhi jaati thi"
 Some other historians do not agree with this about Colonel James Tod
 His statement is that Mansingh was not the adopted son of Bhagwan Das, but he was the son of Bhagwant Das
 bhagavaandas or bhagwant das donon bhai the
 Mughal-history books reveal that on the orders of Akbar, his experienced officers Maharaja Mansingh, local subedar Qutubuddin Khan and Raja Bhagwant Das of Amer made a lot of research to capture Maharana Pratap in the forests of Gogunda and Mewar but eventually failed Akbar became very angry - even in the year 1577, both of them were 'locked up' diyodhi! " "muslim itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he hijri 1024 san 1615 isvi main maansingh kii bengal main mrityu hui, parantu duusare itihaaskaaron ke vivaran se pataa chalata he ki maansingh uttar kii taraf khilji badshaah se yuddh karne gaya tha jahaan vah san 1617 isvi main maaraa gaya

 Punctuality is called being able to fulfill a necessary task or fulfill an obligation at a pre-determined time or ahead of time
 "samaynishth" kaa prayog aksar "samay par" ke samaan hota he
 According to each culture, there is often an understanding that is considered an acceptable level of punctuality
 aam taur par vilamb kii ek choti maatra sweekaarya hoti he; pashchimi samskruti main yah saamanytah lagbhag das yaa pandrah minute kaa hota he
 In some cultures such as Japanese society or military, basically no such permission is allowed
 kuch samskritiyon main ek avyakt samaj hoti he ki vaastavik samay simaaen bataayi gayi samay simaaon se alag hai; udhaaharan ke liye kisi vishesh samskruti main yah samajha ja saktaa he ki log vigyaapit samay ke ek ghante baad taiyaar ho jaaenge
 is maamle main chunki prayek vyakti yah samajhataa he ki 9:00 baje subah kii baithak vastav main 10:00 baje ke aasapaas shuru hogi, aise main jab har koi 10:00 baje aata he to kisi ko koi asuvidha mahasoos nahin hoti he
 In cultures where punctuality is valued, delaying is akin to disrespecting another's time and may be considered insulting
 aise maamalon main samay kii pabandi saamaajik dand dwaara lagu kii ja sakati he, udhaaharan ke liye, der se aane vaale nimnastareey logon ko baithkon se puri tarah baahar kar dena
 aisi baaten arthmiti main samay kii pabandi ke mahatva par vichaar karne or panktibaddhta ke siddhant main dusron par gaiyr-samaynishtha ke prabhaav par dhyaan dene kaa kaaran ho sakati hai
 In many circumstances the requirements for punctuality are uneven
 udhaaharan ke liye, doctor ke clinics yaa hawaii adde par graahakon se nirdhaarit samay par aane kii apeksha kii jaati he anyathaa yah mauka unke haath se nikal saktaa he, lekin uske baad bhi unhen doctor se milane yaa hawaii jahaaj main baithne se pehle lambey samay tak intazaar karnaa pad saktaa he
 It can be considered an estimation of the respective value of provider and customer time whose true value can be determined by the joint effort of the principle of queuing and the theory of the game
 agar saapeksh mulya alag hota to atirikt vimaanon yaa doctoron kii vyavastha kar or unka kam-upyog karte hue, anupatik rup se yatra ke mulya yaa chikitsa suvidha ko badhaane kii keemat par pratiksha samay ko kam karnaa aasaan hota
 ise amiron ke aacharan main dekha ja saktaa he jo is sthiti ke vipareet nijee vimaan kiraye par lene or unke paas aane vaale doctoron kaa kharch uthaa sakate hai or atyadhik amiron ke vishisht maamle main, unke paas apane vyaktigat chikitsak or samarpit nijee vimaan or vimaan chaalak dal ho sakate hai jo vishesh rup se unki jaruraton par intazaar main khadey rahete hai
 This interpretation of punctuality in relation to the value of personal time may have been a reason for describing punctuality as "the kindness of kings"; This description is often attributed to Louis XVIII

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 mundakopanishad ke anusaar srishtikarta brahma, atharva, angi, satyavah or angira kii brahmavidya kii acharya parampara thi
 In the resolution of Shaunak's curiosity that "what element is made aware of everything, Angira Sris preached him to theology in which he distinguish the altar and the placenta of Vidya and gave Veda Vedang the name Apara and the knowledge that is called Parvidya
 The word Brahm is attained
 vihit yajna yagadi ke falswaroop swargadi divya kintu anitya lok sadhate hai parantu karmfal kaa bhoga samaapt hote hi manushya athwa hinatar yoni main jeev jaraamaran ke chakkar main padataa he 
 Seeing the impermanence of the results, be disillusioned with the world, taking initiation from the Brahmastriya Guru and attaining brahmopathi is the ultimate effort of man
 brahm "bhootyoni" he arthath usee se pranimaatr utpann hote or usee main leen hote hai
 This action is not caused by any cosmic element, but as the ejaculatory extracts and swallows the webs from itself, just as drugs and hair come out of the earth and hair and follicles come out of the body, in the same way there is cosmopolitanism from Brahm
 apane anirvachaneey gyanarupi tap se vah kinchit sthool ho jaataa he jisase ann, praan, man, satya, lok, karm, karmfal, hiranyagarbha, namrup, indriyaan, akaash, vaayu, jyoti, jal or pruthivi ityadi utpann hote hai

 The true form of Brahma is avyakta and achintya

 However, Sat and Asat, far and away, near and near, great and subtle in the heart, dynamic and dreamy, etc
, its characteristic nature is also often described
 brahm ko kore gyaan athwa paanditya se, teevr indriyon, medha, athwa karm se nahin paa sakate, kaamanaayon kaa tyaag, nishtharupi bal, satya, brahmacharya, man or indriyon kii ekaagratha rupi tap, anasakti or samyak gyaan ityadi upayon se manovikaron ke nasht ho jane par buddhi shuddh ho jaati he jisase dhyanavastha main paramatma kaa saakshaatkaar ho jaataa he 
 For this, the great weapon of the Upanishads is directed towards the pursuit of selling the goal of Brahmrupi, being attuned to the self-proclaimed arrow that is sharpened by worship on the bow
 isse jeevatma or paramatma ke abhed kaa anubhavatmak gyaan ho jaataa he; hryday kii gaanth khul jaati, sab sanshay mit jate or punya or paap ke bandhan se mukti mil jaati he evam maran kaal main aatma or paramatma ek ho jate hai
 The form of this "monotony" is similar to attaining monotony after the flowing rivers meet in the sea
 dwaitvaadi "ek hi vriksh par sate baithe do pakshi mitron main ek pipal ke mithe-mithe gode khaataa or doosraa takata maatr he" 
 In the mantra, the karma-fruit-bhakta takes the distinct distinction between the soul and the brahm, considering the difference between the two, but with the followings and other mantras and the sentence "brahmveda Brahmav Bhavati", the principle of this Upanishads is derived from Brahmatmakya
 upanishdon ke rachanakaal ke sambandh main vidwaanon kaa ek mat nahin he
 Some Upanishads have been considered as part of the original codes of the Vedas
 ye sarvaadhik pracheen hai
 Some Upanishads are considered portions of 'brahman' and 'aranyak' texts

 According to Vishnu Purana the human hand dimensions are as follows: - vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparokt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he:- This is not explained in detail
 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 Friction: yadi kisi sthir thos vastu par koi duusari thos vastu is tarah se rakhi jaati he kii donon samtal prishto ek-dusre ko spost karte he, to is dasha main duusari vastu ko pehali vastu par khisakane ke liye bal lagaana padataa he l is bal kaa man ek seemaa se kam hone par duusari vastu pehali vastu par nahin khisak sakati he l is kathan se yah spasht he kii donon vastue ke sampark taal ek bal gati ke vipareet disha main utpan ho jaataa he jo duusari vastu kii gati main virodh karata he l is virdohi bal ko ‘gharshan’ kehete he l Friction is a force that opposes the relative tangential motion between two planes
 gharshan bal kaa maan donon talon ke bich abhilamb bal par nirbhar karata he
 There are two types of friction: static and kinetic
 sthitik gharshan do pindon ke sampark-prishth kii samaantar disha main lagata he, lekin gatij gharshan gati kii disha par nirbhar nahi karata
 Generally, no surface is completely smooth, but it has very small elevations and pits
 inako achche sookshmdarshi dwaara hi dekha ja saktaa he
 Therefore, when two such surfaces touch each other, the lifts of one surface get trapped in the pits of the other surface
 is avasthaa main ek sataha ko duusari sataha par khiskaane ke liye bal lagane par sataha kii banaavat main vikrut utpann ho jaati he
 Accordingly, stress works in the direction against the force used due to the elasticity of materials, which is called friction
 hamaare dainik jivan main gharshan kaa bahut mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The speed of each vehicle moving on the surface of the earth is possible only by the friction between the surface and the base of the vehicle
 at: gharshan gati baadhak tathaa sadhak donon hi he
 Friction also has a prominent place in the behavior of torrents and lubricants
 Sand adopts a cone shape with the inclination angle of the internal friction
kisi thos padarthpind ko thos sataha par visthapit karne ke liye sparsh sataha ke samaantar bal prayukt karnaa hota he
 If the force applied is less than a certain magnitude, the substance does not displace and if it is exceeded, it displaces at a fixed velocity
 aisa sparsh karanevaali satahon ke bich gharshan ke kaaran hota he, jisase taatpary yah he ki thos padarthpind par sparsh sataha ke samaantar prayukt bal kii viruddh disha main ek bal kaary karata he, jise gharshan bal kehete hai
 Friction force causes roughness of surfaces
 visthaapan se purv gharshanbal prayukt bal ke baraabar hota he, jise sthitik gharshan kehete he
 The force used for displacement must be at least of such magnitude that the deformation is greater than the peak elasticity
 visthaapan ke liye aavashyak is nunatam bal ke pariman ko charam gharshanbal kehete hai
 The peak pressure between the two forces of friction and both surfaces has the following relation: jabaki sthitik dharshansthiraank kehalaata he
 Its value can be determined by placing the substance on the surface and placing it on the surface by knowing the minimum inclination angle of the surface at which the substance starts slipping
 is kone ko gharshankon kehete hai
 The tangent of the friction angle is equal in magnitude to the static friction constant, ie gati ke samay bhi padarthpind par gharshanbal kaary karata he
 Its magnitude mainly depends on the type of displacement
 ek thos padarthpind ko thos sataha par khiskaakar yaa ludhakaakar hi visthapit kar sakate hai; at: inhen do visthaapan prakaaron ke anusaar nimnaankit do prakaar ke gatiya gharshan hote hai
 1 - erosive friction 2 - lunthan gharshan The magnitude of friction for both types of speeds is expressed by the following formula: Fb = bc x p While friction is the pressure on the surface and the kinetic friction constant, the value of which depends on both surfaces
 satahon kii laghu saapeksh gati ke liye cag kaa maan gati ke pariman par nirbhar nahin karata
 But when the magnitude of the speed exceeds the critical velocity, the value of the kag increases with the increase in velocity
