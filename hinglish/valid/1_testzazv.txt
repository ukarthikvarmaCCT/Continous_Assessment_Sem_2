 The Corporate Bodies Authority File or GKD is a German authority control for the organisation of corporation names from catalogues
 It is used mainly for documentation in libraries
 Like the Subject Headings Authority File and the Name Authority File, the GKD is looked after and updated by the German National Library, the Bavarian State Library, the Berlin State Library and, since 1997, the Austrian National Library, several library networks taking part
 The responsible editor is the State Library in Berlin
 The Common Corporate File was created in the 1970s from the catalogue data of the Journal Database 
 In April 2004 it contained more than 915,000 records
 Since April 2012 GKD, SWD and PND are part of the Integrated Authority File
 As with the SWD and PND, the "rules for Alphabetical Cataloguing" are used
 They stipulate, amongst other things, what counts as a corporation
 These include, inter alia, local authorities and associations such as firms and clubs, but also congresses and exhibitions
 In addition to names of individual corporations, GKD data files contain links to parent bodies as well as earlier and later names
 GKD records are uniquely identified by an ID number, the GKD number
 The GKD number consists of digits, the last being a check digit, which can also be 'X' 
 The number ranges are divided into quotas by library network, so that, for newer records, it can be determined in which network they were created
 The GKD, like the PND and SWD, is available to information systems in libraries and other areas via the DDB file on a standard CD-ROM or via a Z39
50 interface - but usually only for a fee
 For access to authority records, there is a separate machine exchange format for Libraries or MAB GKD
 Previously microfiches were used
 The search for individual corporations enabled by the GKD is part of many catalogues
 a link to the name authorities of the Library of Congress is provided
 a link to Wikipedia is still in the planning stage
 The example is not given directly in internal PICA+ or MAB format
 GKD records can refer to one another using "earlier / later name" and "related to" fields

 Brothers, i recite to you a few lines of a hymn which i have been reciting since childhood and which millions of humans do every day: arthath jaise vibhinn nadiyaan bhinn bhinn sroton se nikalakar samudr main mil jaati hai usee prakaar he prabho! bhinn bhinn ruchi ke anusaar vibhinn tede-medhe athwa sidhe raste se janevaale log ant main tujhmen hi aakar mil jate hai
 This gathering, which is one of the best sacred conferences ever held, automatically renders this wonderful sermon of the Gita and announces it to the world: arthath jo koi meri ore aata he-chaahe kisi prakaar se ho-main usko praapt hota hoon
 People try on different paths and finally come towards me
 sampradayikta, hathdharmita or unki vibhats vanshdhar dharmandhata is sundar prithvi par bahut samay tak rajya kar chuki hai
 They have been filling the earth with violence and bathing it repeatedly with the blood of humanity, demolishing civilizations and putting entire countries in despair
 yadi ye vibhats daanvi shaktiyaan na hotin to maanav samaaj aaj kii avasthaa se kahin adhik unnat ho gaya hota
 But now their time has come, and i hope internally that the loud sound that has been made in honor of this gathering this morning is of all the indignity, of all the atrocities caused by sword or pen and moving towards the same goal
 The death of mutual bitterness of human beings should be proved to be innocent
 25 varsh kii avasthaa main narendra ne gerua vastra dhaaran kar liye the
 After that he traveled all over India on foot
 san 1893 main chicago main vishwa dharm parishad ho rahi thi
 Swami Vivekananda reached there as the representative of India
 europe-america ke log us samay paradheen bharatvasiyon ko bahut hin drushti se dekhte the
 There people tried hard not to give Swami Vivekananda the time to speak in the Sarvadharma Parishad
 parantu ek american professor ke prayaas se unhen thodaa samay mila
 All the scholars were surprised to hear his views in that council
 phir to america main unka atyadhik swaagat hua
 There became a large community of his devotees
 teen varsh ve america main rahe or vahaan ke logon ko bhartiya tatvagyan kii adbhut jyoti pradaan kii
 Given his oratory style and knowledge of the media there Saiclonik Hindu named him
 "aadhyatm-vidya or bhartiya darshan ke bina vishwa anaath ho jaayegaa" yah swami vivekananda kaa drudh vishwaas tha
 In the United States, he established several branches of the Ramakrishna Mission
 anek amareeki vidwaanon ne unka shishyatv grahan kiya
 They always address themselves as servants of poor
 bharat ke gaurav ko desh-deshaantaron main ujjwal karne kaa unhone sadaa praytn kiya
 The work that Swami Vivekananda did in the brief lifetime of thirty-nine years will continue to guide the generations for many centuries to come
 tees varsh kii aayu main swami vivekananda ne chicago, america ke vishwa dharm sammelan main hindu dharm kaa pratinidhitiv kiya or use saarvbhaumik pahchaan dilvaayi
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur once said- "if you want to know India, read Vivekananda
 unamem aap sab kuch sakaaratmak hi paayenge, nakaaratmak kuch bhi nahin
 " romaa rolland ne unke bare main kaha tha-"unke dwitiya hone kii kalpana karnaa bhi asambhav he, ve jahaan bhi gayi, sarvapratham hi rahe
 Everyone used to show their leader in them
 ve ishwar ke pratinidhi the or sab par prabhutv praapt kar lenaa hi unki vishistataa thi
 Once in the Himalayas, an unknown traveler stopped looking at them and shouted, "shiva!" This happened as if that person's adorable god had written his name on his forehead
 " He was not only a saint, but also a great patriot, speaker, thinker, writer and human lover
 america se lautakar unhone deshavaasiyon kaa aahvaan karte hue kaha tha-"nayaa bharat nikal pade mochi kii dukaan se, bhadbhoonje ke bhaad se, kaarkaane se, haat se, bazaar se; nikal padey jhaadiyon, jangalon, pahaado, parvaton se
 "and the public answered Swamiji's call
 vah garv ke saath nikal padi
 The public support that Gandhiji got in the freedom struggle was the result of Vivekananda's call
 is prakaar ve bhartiya swatantrata sangram ke bhi ek pramukh prerana ke strot bane
 He believed that the holy year of India is the holy land of religion and philosophy
 yaheen bade-bade mahatmaon va rishiyon kaa janm hua, yahi sanyas evam tyaag kii bhoomi he tathaa yaheen-keval yaheen-adikaal se lekar aaj tak manushya ke liye jivan ke sarvocch adarsh evam mukti kaa dwaar khulaa hua he
 His statement - "'get up, wake up, wake yourself up and wake others up
" apane nar-janm ko safal karo or tab tak nahin ruko jab tak lakshya praapt na ho jaye
 " unnisvin sadi ke aakhri varshon main vivekananda lagbhag sashastr yaa hinsak kranti ke jariye bhi desh ko aaazaad karnaa chaahate the
 But he soon became convinced that the circumstances were not yet ripe for those intentions
 iske baad hi vivekananda ne ‘ekala chalo‘ kii niti kaa paalan karte hue ek parivrajak ke rup main bharat or duniya ko khangaal daalaa
 He said that i want many young ascetics who can spread to the villages of India and spend time in the service of the countrymen
 unka yah sapana puraa nahin hua
 Vivekananda was strongly opposed to priesthood, religious fanaticism, dogma and orthodoxy
 unhone dharm ko manushya kii seva ke kendra main rakhkar hi aadhyatmik chintan kiya tha
 Their Hindu religion was not strange, ludicrous and pneumatic
 unhone yah vidrohi bayaan diya tha ki is desh ke taintis karod bhukhe, daridr or kuposhan ke shikaar logon ko devi devataaon kii tarah mandiron main sthapit kar diya jaye or mandiron se devi devataaon kii murtiyon ko hataa diya jaye
 This classic call of theirs raises a big question mark at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century
 unke is aahvaan ko sunakar puure purohit varg kii ghigghi bandh gai thi
 Today, if any other sage, can the government machinery also not afford to remove the idol of any illegal temple
 vivekananda ke jivan kii antarlay yahi thi ki ve is baat se aashwast the ki dharti kii god main yadi aisa koi desh he jisane manushya kii har tarah kii behatari ke liye eemaandaar koshishen kii hai, to vah bharat hi he
 He also ridiculed priesthood, Brahminism, religious rituals and stereotypes and waged a war against such inconsistencies in almost invasive language
 unki drushti main hindu dharm ke sarvshereshth chintakon ke vichaaron kaa nichod puri duniya ke liye ab bhi irshyaa kaa vishay he
 Swamiji had indicated that there is material prosperity abroad and that India needs it too, but we should not be a petitioner
 hamaare paas usase zyada bahut kuch he jo ham pashchim ko de sakate hai or pashchim ko uski besakhta jarurat he
 This was not a boast or boast of Swami Vivekananda for the heritage of his country

 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers

 madanaditya ne shaq hone par kamakandala ko uske ghar par najarband kar diya
 On this, Kamkandla and Madhavanal began to correspond with Madhavi, but Madanaditya caught Madhavi carrying a letter everyday
 dar va dhan ke pralobhan se madhavi ne sara sach ugal diya
 Madanaditya detained Kamakandala and sent him to the police to arrest Madhavanal on charges of treason

 Seeing that his purpose was not being fulfilled, King Vikramaditya worshiped Mother Bamleshwari Devi and finally got ready to offer his life
 tab devi ne prakat hokar apane bhakt ko aatmghaat se roka
 After this Vikramaditya also asked for the boon with the life of Madhavanal Kamakandala that Maa Bagulamukhi should be revered in the mountain in his awakened form
