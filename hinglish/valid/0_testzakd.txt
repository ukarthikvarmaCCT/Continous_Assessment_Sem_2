 "abhijana" in this context means noble, scholar, virtuous, noble
 pashchim main "aristocraisi" kaa arth bhi lagbhag yahi he
 Aflatoon and his disciple Aristotle in his books consider Aristacracy as the rule of intelligent, virtuous persons

 Scholars believe that India also had some aristocrats in ancient times

 For these philosophers, Aflatoon has arranged communic and property-related communism
 rajyadarshan ke itihaas main dhaniktantr ko bhi kabhi-kabhi abhijatatantr mana gaya he
 There are two reasons for this
 pratham, donon main shashansatta ek vyakti yaa samast vayask nagarikon ke haath main na hokar thode se vyaktiyon ke haath main hoti he
 Secondly, some believe that only Dhanasanchaya can do Charatrivaan and thus he is an expression of virtue
 anek aadhunik samajashastriyon kaa mat he ki rajtantr or janatantr main bhi vastav main samprabhutaa thode se vyaktiyon ke hi haath main hoti he
 The king has to depend on the help of shrewd politicians for governance

 The reins of governance are also in the hands of clever politicians in a democracy and they are rich
 vaastavik raajnneetik prakriya main jo sanmpann hai, vahi chatur hai, vahi raajnneetijna hai, prashasan or raajnneetik dalbandi main unheen kaa sikaa chalata he
 But how to appoint an elite? If by public election, it is a kind of democracy
 yadi anya kisi prakaar se, to abhijan shashan sankeern, swaarthee, durvinith or dhanpriya ho jate hai or apni kshamta ko parivartit paristhiti ke anuroop nahin rakh pate
 Today, the main problem of democracy and aristocracy is that somehow the incremental effect of money in the state should be resolved and the public should choose the wise service persons as their ruler

 Historians do not know for sure what was the significance of the Mahasanagriha, but by looking at the power and expense in making it, it can be deduced that it was an important site for the residents of Mohan Jodaro

 Over time, the towns of Mohan Joddo stopped using the Mahasanagriha

 Only his mound looked like an ordinary mound

 naveen putali madhumalati ne jo katha sunai usase vikramaditya kii praja ke hit main pranotsarg karne kii bhaavana jhalkati he
 The story goes like this: Once King Vikramaditya organized a huge yagna for the happiness and prosperity of the state and the subjects
 kai dinon tak yajna chalata rahaa
 One day the king was reciting mantras, then a sage came there
 raja ne unhen dekha, par yajna chhodkar uthanaa asambhav tha
 He greeted and paid obeisance to his mind
 rishi ne bhi rajya kaa abhipraay samajhakar unhen aashirwad diya
 When the king got up from the yagna, he asked the sage the purpose of coming
 raja ko maaloom tha ki nagar se baahar kuch hi dur par van main rishi ek gurukul chalaate hai jahaan bachche vidya praapt karne jate hai
 The sage replied that he did not give any inconvenience to the king on the auspicious occasion of the yajna, if there was no question of the lives of six children ranging from eight to twelve years
 raja ne unase sab kuch vistaar se bataane ko kaha
 On this, the sage told that some children were roaming around in the forest picking dry wood for the ashram
 tabhi do rakshas aae or unhen pakadakar unchi pahari par le gaye
 When they did not find Rishi present, they wandered out of the forest in search of him
 tabhi pahari ke upar se garjana jaisi aawaaj sunai padi jo nishchit hi unamem se ek rakshas kii thi
 The demon said that instead of the lives of those children they need a man whom they will sacrifice in front of mother Kali
 jab rishi ne bali ke hetu apane-aapako unke hawaale karnaa chaha to unhone asahmati jataai
 He said that the sage is old and the black mother will not be happy with the sacrifice of such a weak old man
 kaali maan kii bali ke liye atyant swasth kshatriya kii aavashyaktaa he
 The demons have said that if someone tries to free those children by deceit or force, then those children will be rolled and killed from the hill
 raja vikramaditya se rishi kii pareshaani nahin dekhi ja rahi thi
 He immediately got ready and said to the sage - "you took me to that hill
 main apane aapako kaali ke sammukh bali ke liye prastut karrunga
 i am healthy and Kshatriya too
 rakshason ko koi aapatti nahin hogi
 "when the sage heard it, he was shocked and sang
 unhone lakh manaanaa chaha, par vikram ne apana faisla nahin badla
 He said that if the king survives any misfortune on the subjects of his kingdom, then the king should remove his life by giving his life
 raja rishi ko saath lekar us pahari tak pahunche
 They left their horse at the bottom of the hill and started climbing the mountain on foot
 pahariwaala rasta bahut hi kathin tha, par unhone kathinaayee kii parvaah nahin kii
 They reached the peak of the multiplication table
 unke pahonchte hi ek rakshas bolaa ki vah unhen pahachaanata he or poochne laga ki unhen bacchon kii rihaai kii shart maaloom he ki nahin
 He said that he came here only after knowing everything and he asked the demons to release the children
 ek rakshas bacchon ko apni banhon main lekar uda or neeche unhen surakshit pahunchaa aayaa
 The second demon took them to the place where the idol of Maa Kali was and remains sacrificial
 Vikramaditya bowed his head to the sacrificer
 ve zaraa bhi vichlit nahin hue
 He remembered God for the last time in his mind and he agreed to take the demon pillar and separate him from his head
 achaanak us rakshas ne khadg fk diya or vikram ko gale laga liya
 The place was suddenly filled with amazing light and fragrance
 vikram ne dekha ki donon rakshason kii jagah indra tathaa pawan devtaa khadey the
 Both of them had done all this to take their examinations
 They wanted to see whether Vikram could only donate worldly things or had the ability to do pranasogra
 unhone raja se kaha ki unhen yajna karata dekh hi unke man main is pariksha kaa bhav janma tha
 He blessed Vikram to be famous and said that his fame would spread all around

 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 1395 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he
 In the context of phonology, those 'almost immovable' places in the oral cavity are called accent points, which are pronounced when touching 'movable objects' that obstruct the sound path
 utpann vyanjan kii vishisht prakruti mukhyatah teen baton par nirbhar karti he- uccharan sthaan, uccharan vidhi or svanan 
 In the buccal cavity, the 'fixed diagonal' is mainly a part of the roof of the buccal cavity while the 'movable diacritic' is mainly the tongue, the lower lip, and the anus
 vyanjan vah dhwani he jiske uccharan main hawa abaadh gati se na nikalakar mukh ke kisi bhaag se yaa to purna avaruddh hokar aage badhati he yaa sankeern maarg se gharshan karte hue yaa parshv se nikle
 Thus, complete or incomplete obstruction is present in the airways
 vyanjanon kaa vargeekaran mukhya rup se sthaan or praytn ke adhar par kiya jaataa he
 The consonant is easily identifiable by the place of origin of the consonants
 is drushti se hindi vyanjanon kaa vargeekaran is prakaar he- The classification of consonants produced as a result of the process of pronunciation or effort is as follows- sparsh : uccharan avyavon ke sparsh karne tathaa sahasaa khulne par jin dhvaniyon kaa uccharan hota he unhen sparsh kaha jaataa he
 A, b, c, d, t, t, d, d, t, t, d, d, p, f, b, b and q - all sounds are touch
 c, chha, ja, jha ko pehle 'sparsh-sangharshi' naam diya jaataa tha lekin ab saralata or sankshiptata ko dhyaan main rakhte hue inhen bhi sparsh vyanjanon ke varg main rakhaa jaataa he
 The accent components in their pronunciation open slowly rather than open
 maukhik va nasiky : vyanjanon ke duusare varg main maukhik va nasiky dhvaniyaan aati hai
 In Hindi, the consonants ण, j, n, n, m are nasal
 inke uccharan main shwaasavayu naak se hokar nikalati he, jisase dhwani kaa nasikeekaran hota he
 They are also called 'panchamaksharas'
 inke sthaan par anuswaar kaa prayog suvidhjanak mana jaataa he
 Except for these consonants, all the other consonants are oral
 parshvik : in vyanjanon ke uccharan main shwaas vaayu jihva ke donon parshvon se nikalati he
 'L' is such a sound
 ardh swar : in dhvaniyon ke uccharan main uccharan avyavon main kahin bhi purna sparsh nahin hota tathaa shwaasavayu anvarodhit rahati he
 Hindi has Y, and Ardhvar
 lunthit : in vyanjanon ke uccharan main jihva vartsy bhaag kii ore uthati he
 'su' is a similar sound in Hindi
 utkshipt : jin vyanjan dhvaniyon ke uccharan main jihva nok kathor taalu ke saath jatke se takaraakar neeche aati he, unhen utkshipt kehete hai
 d and d are similar dishes
 vyanjanon ke vargeekaran main swar-tantriyon kii sthiti bhi mahatvapurn maani jaati he
 In this view, the consonants are divided into two classes - Ghosh and Aghosha
 jin vyanjanon ke uccharan main swartantriyon main kampan hota he, unhen ghosh yaa saghosh kaha jaataa hai
 The second type of sounds is called aghosha
 swartantriyon kii aghosh sthiti se arthath jinke uccharan main kampan nahin hota unhen aghosh vyanjan kaha jaataa he
 The dishes are also categorized on the basis of spirituality
 praan kaa arth he - shwaas vaayu
 The consonant sounds which have more breathing force in pronunciation are called aspirations and those which have less use of breath are called hypnotic consonants
 panch virgon main duusari or chauthi dhvaniyaan mahapraan hai
 Kh, d, g, jh, th, dh, th, dh, f, bh, d, dh - consonants of Hindi are aspirated
 virgon ke pehle, tisare or paanchave varna alpapraan hai
 The sounds of k, c, ch, j, t, d, t, d, p, b, y, r, l, v, are of this class
 ise yaad rakhe
 Austronesian languages are a language family whose member languages extend over many islands in southeastern Asia and the Pacific Ocean

 Many Austronesian languages are spoken by more than 10 million people, although there are some languages that only count people speak
 lagbhag 20 austronishian bhashaaon ko apane deshon kii rajbhasha hone kaa darja praapt he
 These languages are spoken in the Far West from Madagascar, located close to the coast of Africa to the Hawaiian Islands in the Far East
 bhashavaigyanik adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki taiwan par boli jane vaali austronishian bhashaaon main sab se adhik vividhta he
 This is often a sign of being the homeland of a language, so linguists believe that the adi-austronesian ancestor language originated here and then this language-family began to spread from here
 is vichaar ke anusaar aadi-austronishian samskruti sabase pehle taiwan main aaj se 5,500 varsh purv panpi thi
 Some linguists disagree with this ideology and based on genetic maternal clusters, it is likely that the oldest Austronesian culture actually originated somewhere near the island of Sulawesi 13,000–17,000 years ago and originated from the rise of the sea at the end of the last ice age
 Due to social instability, it began to spread outside its motherland
 devarada, tharali tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke chamoli jile kaa ek gaanv he

 Sutauli is a village in Almora district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Someshwar tehsil
 lok sahitya kaa abhipraay us sahitya se he jisaki rachana lok karata he
 Folk literature is as ancient as human, so it contains every stage of public life, every class, every time and nature
 dow satyendra ke anusaar- "lok manushya samaaj kaa vah varg he jo abhijatya sanskaar shastreeyta or paanditya kii chetana athwa ahankaar se shunya he or jo ek parampara ke pravaah main jivit rahata he
 " saadhaaran janata se sambandhit sahitya ko loksahitya kahana chahie
 Ordinary life is different from typical life, so the ideal of public literacy is different from specific literature
 kisi desh athwa kshetra kaa loksahitya vahaan kii adikaal se lekar ab tak kii un sabhi pravritiyon kaa pratik hota he jo saadhaaran janaswabhaav ke antargat aati hai
 In this literature, all kinds of feelings of life are encountered without any artificiality
 at: yadi kahin kii samoochee samskruti kaa adhyayan karnaa ho to vahaan ke loksahitya kaa vishesh avlokan karnaa padegaa
 It is less written and more verbal
 vaise hindi loksahitya ko lipibaddh karne kaa prayaas idhar kuch varshon se kiya ja rahaa he or anek granth bhi sampadit rup main saamne aae hai kintu ab bhi maukhik loksahitya bahut badi maatra main asangruhit he
 The depiction of the simplest, naturalistic expression of folk life is found in folklore and folklore, it is rare elsewhere
 lok-sahitya main lok-maanav kaa hriday bolta he
 Nature itself sings and chants
 lok-sahitya main nihit saundarya kaa moolyankan sarvatha anubhutijnya he
 From time to time, there are some special principles of folklore that survive with the help of Shruti and Smriti
 is sahitya main mukhya rup se ve rachanaayen hi sweekaar kii jaati hai athwa jivan paati hai jo anek kanthon se anek roopon main ban bigadakar ek sarvamaanya rup dhaaran kar leti hai
 This sequence has continued since time immemorial
 aisi bahut si sahityak saamagree aaj bhi prachlit he jo abhi ekarupata nahin grahan kar pai hai
 Due to traditional and collective talent, scholars have termed folk literature as "apaurusheya"
 nishchay hi paramparaagat loksahitya kisi ek vyakti kii rachana kaa parinaam nahin he
 Although many proofs can be given that the form of the same song, story or proverb as it happens at one place changes its form by reaching the other place, but a good proof would be that folklore sung for hundreds of years
 Alh-khand could not achieve uniformity till date
 is kaary main lokpravriti kisi pratibandh ko sweekaar hi nahin karti
 In Sphut songs, only the lines are moving here and there, but in the management songs and stories, the incidents also change
 yah sab hote hue bhi un prabandhon evam kathaon ke parinaamon main praaia: koi parivartan nahin sweekaar kiya jaataa
 The result and the prevailing truth and facts are taken as the basis of the event cycle arbitrarily
 ramakatha ko hi len
 The matter of "nana like Rama Avatara, Ramayan Sat Koti Apara" is 100 percent true
 ramakatha sambandhi jitani vividhtaayen loksahitya main prachlit hai yadi un sab ko ekatra kiya jaae to yah vicitra prakaar kaa "lokaramayana" granth taiyaar hoga jo abtak ke sabhi ramakhyanon se bhinn astitv kaa hoga
 Seeing the events of the cycle, sometimes it will be difficult to establish their association
 udhaahranswaroop lokgeeton main bhi ramajanm ke kai kaaran hai kintu ek bahut hi saadhaaran kaaran yah he ki ek baar jab maharaj dasharath praat: kaal sarayu main snaan karne ja rahe the to unka darshan savere hi gali main jhaadoo denevaali helin ko ho gaya
 He taunted that today, a visionless person appeared in the morning, i do not know how the day will pass
 dasharath ko yah baat lag gai or tabhi ve rani samet putraprapti ke liye van main tap karne chale gaye
 Thus, while showing the second reason, the folklorist then brings Dasaratha to a place of penance where the story mixes with the story of other Ramayana
 aise anek udhaaharan mil sakate hai jo parinaam main to nahin kintu ghatnaon ke maamle main ek nahin hai
 The folklore accepts such changes and modifications very easily
 is sahitya kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki yah anek roopon main hote hue bhi anekta main ekta kii bhaavana se yukt hota he
 Even by changing the language of the language, there is no change in sentiment
 ek hi rachana jo kisi sthal par vahaan kii boli main pai jaati he, vahi bahut dur duusari boli main bhi mil jaati he
 This journey of the stories of expressions and arrangements of sputum songs is sometimes so long that one is surprised
 kshetron evam deshon kii seemaa manushya bhale hi nirdhaarit kar de par loksahitya ise sweekaar nahin karata
 This may have been possible because during the journey the ancient man must have taken his literature with him whenever he had gone away and left his mark at the destination which would have been accepted by the people there
 yah kram aaj bhi jari he
 When a Gramya goes to the in-laws house of Naihar, she naturally takes with her the publicities of Naihar which she remembers
 yadi uskaa vivaah maayke kii boliwale kshetra main hua tab to koi baat nahin, kintu anya boli ke kshetra main vivaah hone par vah naihar ke geeton ko sthaneey boli ke lahazon main dhaal leti he
 That work is also assisted by the in-laws of the village
 is prakaar banaav bigaad baraabar chalate rahete hai
 The nature of folk singers and singers has been going on for a long time that if they like the composition of a poet, then they bend it and adapt it to their dialect
 aisa karte samay kabhi kavi kaa naam nikaal diya jaataa he or kabhi rahane diya jaataa he
 Even today, such folk songs can be heard for proof - the way the folk songs will be found in the published texts of Sur, Kabir, Tulsi and Meera, they will not have that form
 kuch lokgeeton main to anayas hi unke naam daal die gaye hai
 This trend is found not only in Hindi but also in the folklore of other languages
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki aise bhajan tathaa geet lokkaviyon dwaara swayan bana liye gaye hai or unki upyogita ko badhaane ke liye ucch evam bahushrut kaviyon ke naam jod die gaye taaki adhikansh log aise geeton ko yaad kar len
 But this is not the case
 lokkavi isi sthal par to udaar hota he
 Many such hymns have been known in the folk life since when the creators are not known
 satya to yah he ki is prakaar ke bhajanon kii sankhya namyukt bhajanon kii sankhya se kahin adhik he or ve sarasata main bhi namdhari bhajanon se ghatakar nahin hai
 There is also a tendency of folklorists to express local events immediately, as happened during the 1934 Bihar earthquake
 bahut dinon se chali aa rahi aanchalik kathatmak samagriyan isi pravriti kii dein hai
 Incidental management and folklore are born with this tendency, but only long life is available to those who touch the public with more skill
 lok-sahitya kii bhashaa shisht or saahitiyik bhashaa na hokar saadhaaran jan kii bhashaa he or uski varnya-vastu lok-jivan main gruhit charitron, bhaavon or prabhaavon tak simit he
 This was the first decree of folk literature
 isaki duusari maryaada he, uski rachana main vyakti kaa nahin balki samooche samaaj kaa samavet yogadan
 This is the reason that instead of the person's impression on folk literature, it is the impression of the whole person-world
 shilp-vidhaan kii baat karte samay ham jab in do mukhya maryaadaaon ko saamne rakhte hai to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki isamen shilp-vidhaan ke liye koi abhyaas yaa kaushal parilakshith nahin ho saktaa, kyonki shilp kaa vidhaan yadi hamen dikhaata he to vah saamaajik samarasata kii vivashtaa ke kaaran apane aap udbhoot rup main hi
 In the prevailing sense, the matter of craftsmanship cannot be raised here
 log samajhate yahi hai ki shilp ke peeche ek purv-chintit vyapaar avashya sannihit hota he or chunki lok-sahitya main aisa koi vyapaar hone kii sambhaavna nahin he isliye uske shilp-vidhaan kii baat nahin uthati
 But from a physical point of view, shilp-vidhan means to connect expression with expression
 lok-sahitya main shilp-vidhaan apane utkarsh par he, kyonki vah, sabase adhik yaheen par nirabhimaan, nirvyaj or nisargodbhoot he
 There are mainly four distinctions of folk literature; Folk-songs, folk-songs, folk-tales and folk-dramas
 lok-gaatha or lok-katha main bhed itnaa hi he ki lok-gaatha ek lambe aakhyaan-geet ke rup main chalati he or isamen prabandh-yojana gaatha-pradhan na hokar ras-pradhan hoti he, jabaki lok-katha gadyatmak hone ke saath-saath katha pradhan yaa duusare shabdon main ghatana-pradhan hua karti he
 Folk theater is limited to farce or leela based on eclectic and conversational acting keeping public theater in view
 isamen samayikta kaa vishesh dhyaan rahane ke kaaran sthaayee prabhaav daalane kii kshamta nahin hoti he
 In folklore and folklore, the craft is predominant, only the folk song is such that in which the craft-structure can develop in its overall form, these four forms of craft-structure are similar in all these forms
 As expected
 loksahitya kii jo apni kuch vishesh pravritiyaan hai ve utani hi pracheen hai jitna pracheen yah sahitya he
 Confirmation of these trends is credited with making huge and different creations
 suvidha ke liye inhen nimnlikhit prakaaron main baanta ja saktaa he : The literature related to the faith which was imposed on the human being due to the various welfare results of the nature of the primitive human beings comes under it
 isamen bhakthi evam bhay donon prakaar kii bhavanaayen sannihit hoti hai
 Literature related to superstitions composed for the worship of Gods and Goddesses is under this
 inamen kuch vishwaason ko aanchalik or kuch ko vyapak mahatv diya jaataa he
 Comprehensive compositions are found on local and extensive on local achievements
 dharti, akaash, kuna, talab, nadi, naala, dih, dyohaar, mari masaan, vriksh, fasal, paudha, pashu, daitya daanav devi devtaa, kuldevataa, brahm evam tirth aadi par jo mantra yaa geet prachlit hai ve isi ke ang hai
 Whenever villagers start an auspicious work, the songs or mantras used to please the gods and goddesses associated with it all come in this literature
 rogon ke nidaan ke liye bhi bajaay oshadhi ke geeton evam mantron kaa prayog hota he
 For example, songs of Sheetla Mata can be taken
 pruthak-pruthak devi devataaon ke liye pruthak-pruthak mantra, geet, pujan evam bhoga aadi kii samagriyan pataa nahin kab se nirdhaarit kii ja chuki hai
 Somebody likes something, but Brahma should be replaced by all these
 inhen ke anusaar geet ev mantra to badalte hi hai, saath hi pujari bhi badalte rahete hai
 Under this, literature related to ethics, ideas and practicality and various popularities comes
 aachaar-vichaar ke liye rachit sahitya main bhaawanaaon or manyataon kaa pravesh he kintu vyavhaar ke liye rache gaye sahitya main yah baat kam dekhne ko milti he
 Characterization of behavior is mainly seen in folklore
 aapasi vyavhaar kii baat to jane den
 Here the snake is also fed with milk
 vriksh ko bhi baba kaha jaataa he or badali tathaa nadiyaan bahan kaa rup dhaaran karti hai
 In the same way, the whole universe has been tied in one form by connecting with many inhuman elements and violent animals
 is sandarbh main rache hue sahitya kaa mul uddeshy vyaavhaarikta ke aadhaar par saral evam sukhi jivan vyateet karnaa he
 This is the reason that life is tied up in a relationship and caste discrimination, which is rampant, has not broken its wall
 daadi dada, bhai bahan aadi ke rishte puure gaanv main bina kisi jaateey bhedbhaav ke chalaa karte hai
 Ethos prevalent for various occasions are also part of this mode
 is sahitya ke antargat rituvidya, swasthyavigyaan, krishivigyaan, evam shakun aadi se sambhddha sahitya aata he
 This type of literature occupies a very important place in the modern scientific era in folk life
 inamen purvaacharyon dwaara nirdhaarit anubhumiyon, niyamon evam tatsambandhi upadeshaatmak baton kaa samavesh hota he
 These beliefs often stand the test of examination, but there are some exceptions as well
 rituvigyaan ke antargat ativrishti, anaavrishti evam alpavrishti ke kaarnon tathaa tajjanya kshatiyon or unase bachane ke upayon kii ore sanket kiye gaye hai
 Traditional experiences are the basis of this type of scientific literature
 chunki vah anubhav bahut pakke hote hai isliye lokgeeton kii bhanti inke banane bigadane kii sambhaavnaayen kam hua karti hai
 This is the condition of literature composed for agriculture
 iske antargat kheti se sambhddha praaia: aavashyak baaten kah di gai hai
 Scientific literature, how to cultivate the field, what type of field should be sown, what is the amount of seed, when should the irrigation be done, when is the sowing and weeding done and when is the crop harvested? Under this, besides these, crop related diseases and remedies are also described
 krishi kaaryon main kaam aanevaale upkarnon tathaa belon kii pahchaan aadi par bhi baari maatra main sahityarachana kii gai he
 Apart from bullocks, there are abundant indications about other domesticated animals
 belon ke baad saarvajanik sahitya ghodon kii pahchaan ke sambandh main praapt hota he
 Since horses are kept less now due to modern scientific vehicles, this type of literature is gradually lacking
 gaanv gaanv main tractaron ke pahunch jane se belon kii pahchaan ke bare main likhe gaye sahitya kii bhi aage shaayad yahi dasha hogi
 Other domestic animals include cattle, buffalo and dogs, but they are indicated for name only
 pakshiyon main tota, maina, kaua, muniyaan, mor, koyal tathaa kabutar aadi ke bare main sanket die gaye hai
 Under this literature, there are indications about the identification of all types of animals that are used in the use of villagers, and the benefit of them
 swasthyavigyaan main vibhinn rogon ke lakshan or unase bachane ke upaay tathaa aushadhiyon kii ore sanket miltaa he
 Which disease is caused and which practices do not cause disease or go away etc
 Things fall under it
 saath hi swasthyapradayini dincharyaan ke liye kuch aadesh bhi die gaye hai
 The identification of herbs, their uses and the benefits arising out of it are also the subjects of this department
 is tarah ke sanket praaia: aadesh ke rup main prastut kiye gaye hai or ve padyon main hai
 This method has also been adopted in literature composed for agronomy and science
 shakunvichaar sambandhi sahitya main mukhya rup se yatra aarambh karne ke liye kalkrmanusaar shubh lakshanon ko dekhte hue yaa to aadesh die gaye hai yaa apshakuton ke kaaran yatrarambh ke liye manaahi kii gai he
 If the journey is very necessary and its time does not seem to be favorable in the calculation of days, then measures have been given to avoid it
 rituon, maanav lakshanon evam pashupakshiyon kii vibhinn harkaton dwaara bhi shakun apshakun kii jaankaree is prakaar ke sahitya ke antargat karai jaati he
 As one should not leave the house during the rainy season, if he calls the cork in the morning on Mundere, he should understand the information about the arrival of a dear person, etc
 sampurna loksahitya kaa ek sarvamaanya rup to hota hi he kintu saath hi vibhinn jatiyon kii paramparaagat samskruti par aadhaarit sahitya bhi hota he
 These include the personal gods and goddesses of those castes, the order of the total deity and the rules, bye-laws and their speech as stated by the Acharyas and saintly Mahatmas
 vibhinn jatiyon jaise - nai, dhobi, ahir, chamaar, kurmi, koyri, noniyaan, baar, bhaat aadi evam vanya tathaa anya jatiyon kii pruthak pruthak samskruti jaateey loksahitya ke antargat aati he
 If it is said that the entire folk culture of somewhere is a symbol of the collective culture of different castes there and will not be inappropriate
 jaateey sahitya ko nikaal dene par loksahitya kaa jo rup batch jayega vah uskaa sachcha pratinidhitiv nahin karegaa
 The composition of this literature is different from the place of creation of specific literature
 yah loksahitya kii hi visheshta he ki uske kisi bhi prakaar kaa nirmaan ekant main nahin hota
 Generally, all those places are the creators of the said literature, where from time to time, the villagers mobilize the lover or motivated by the needs
 isiilie aisa kabhi nahin kaha ja saktaa ki loksahitya ke ang kaa aaj jo rup he vahi kal bhi tha or aage bhi bana rahegaa
 If we say that the main composition of folk literature is the chaupal and the courtyard, then it will not be irrational
 chaoupaalon main praaia: avkaash ke samay gaanv ke log ekatra ho jate hai
 a wide variety of things go on
 ritirivaajon kii charchaa, dharmacharchaa, katha-kahaniyaan, kheti baari kii baat tathaa loakgeet aadi samay samay par chaoupaalon ko mukherit karte rahete hai
 Local major events of the present period also remain the basis for negotiations for a few days
 in sabake nichod rup main jo saamagree jivan paa jaati he vahi kuch dinon baad sthaneey sahitya main shaamil ho jaati hai
 If the importance is more then the propagation of such compositions increases and they keep expanding their area from one chaupal to another and from one village to another
 is prakaar ve rachanaayen kuch varshon main vistrut loksahitya ke bhandar main sammilit ho jaati hai
 The same applies to the literature composed in the augon, where the gramayas gather from time to time
 is tarah purushon evam striyon kaa sahitya janm se hi pruthak-pruthak hota he
 Apart from chaupals and courtyards, there are some places where different genres of this literature are produced
 kheton main nirvaahee athwa katiyaa karte samay, daanth ke gatthar dhote samay, anya samuhik mazdooree karte samay, tirth athwa mela yatra main, jaade main siankal alaavon ke paas, parvon evam saanskarik aayojanon ke samay athwa sankshep main yah kahie ki jab or jahaan gramin stri purushon ke jutav kaa avasar aata he tab or tahaan loksahitya kaa nirmaan hota rahata he
 It cannot be said that all the folklore created in the past is alive and those which are being built today will never end
 sach to yah he ki is sahitya kii vidhaayen yugaprabhav ko sweekaar karke apana rup baraabar badalati rahati hai
 Looking at the literature composed within fifty years, this also becomes clear
 is avadhi main gaanvon ko jitani vaigyanik uplabdhiyaan praapt hui hai unamem adhikansh kaa samavesh loksahitya main ho chukaa he
 The folklore of this era has accepted airplanes directly, except for the magic flying arrows in the ancient folklore
 vaise loksahitya main baiylgaadee, ghoda, oont, hathi tathaa nauka aadi vaahan ab bhi jivit hai kintu motor evam railgadee ne bhi apana sthaan bana liya he
 New constructions taking place in the present period are also getting place in the said literature
 in saahitiyik rachanaaon ke saath ve sabhi lakshan bhi lage hue hai jo unhen deergh jivan pradaan karte hai
 Scholars often say that if the collection of extensive folk literature is not done, they will be lost
 baat sahi he kyonki yugaprabhav ke kaaran pracheen rachanaayen anupyukt prathit hone lagati hai or phir dhire dhire lupt ho jaati hai, jaisaa ki is samay ho bhi rahaa he
 The songs of cinema have made their place in the villages, due to which the folklore is attaining attenuation
 shiksha kaa prasar hone ke kaaran bhi gaanvon kii boliyon main geet gaanevaale purushon evam striyon kaa abhaav hota ja rahaa he
 It seems that in a few days, ancient folk songs sung on the occasion of various rites will be erased and new songs will be replaced in their place, or if desired, women will study by looking at the collections of folklore and sing songs
 aataa pisanevaali kal gaanv main pahunch chuki he or bhi bahut se yantron kaa prasar hota ja rahaa he isliye "zantsar" tathaa kuch anya shram sambandhi geeton kii kami hoti ja rahi he
 Similarly, the events of the present era are also being accepted in it

 a dispute has been going on between India and Pakistan since the Partition for the right over the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 1947 main bharat-pakistan ke bich pratham yuddh bhi kashmir ke liye hi hua tha
 Pakistan started this battle by sending its soldiers as infiltrators in the hope that the people of Kashmir would revolt against India
 is abhiyaan kaa naam pakistan ne yudhbhiyaan jibraltar rakhaa tha
 Thousands of people from both sides were killed in this war lasting five months

 In the war, infantry and armored troops took part in many campaigns with the help of the Air Force
 dono paksho ke bich hue anek yudhon kii tarah is yuddh kii anek jaankariyaan donon pakshon ne saarvajanik nahin kii
 Since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, there were many issues going on between India and Pakistan, although the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was the biggest in it, but there were other border disputes, the most prominent of which was the Rann of Kutch, which was a It was a barren area, was on the partition of 20 march 1965 main pakistan ke dwaara jaanboojh kar kuccha ke ran main jhadpen shuru kar di gayi
 Initially they included only the Border Security Force, but later the army of both the countries also joined the war
 On 1 June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson stopped the fight between the two sides by a fair arbitral court to resolve the dispute
 Established is nyaayalay ne kuccha ke ran kii kareeb 900 varg kilometre jagah pakistan ko de di
 However, Pakistan claimed 3500 square kilometers
 
 Encouraged by the success of the Kutch run, Pakistani politicians, especially the then Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, pressured the President and the Chief of Army Staff General Ayub Khan to order an attack on Kashmir
 bharat us samay china se yuddh haar chukaa tha or unka maananaa tha ki bharat us samay yuddh karne kii sthiti main nahin tha
 Apart from this, Bhutto and other generals agreeing with his view, Yahya Khan and Tikka Khan also believed that the people of Kashmir were willing to merge with Pakistan by liberating from India and would revolt in support of them when the soldiers were disguised as infiltrators
 aakhir general ayub khan dabaav main aa gayi or unhone gupt sainik abhiyaan oparation jibraltar kaa aadesh de diya
 The main objective of this campaign was to incite rebellion among the people of Kashmir and damage the Indian communication system and transport system
 pakistan ke ghuspaithiyon ko jaldi hi pahchaan liya gaya or vidroh karne ke bajaay janata ne unki soochna bhartiya sainikon ko de di or yah abhiyaan purnatah vifal ho gaya
 On August 5, 1965, between 26000 and 3 xxrep 4 0 Pakistani soldiers crossed the Line of Control in the dress of the local population of Kashmir and entered Indian Kashmir
 bhartiya sena ne sthaneey aabaadi se isaki soochna paakar 15 agast ko niyantran rekha ko paar kiya

 yahi nahin, pakistan kii kaman ko lagane laga ki pakistani kashmir kaa mahatvapurn shahar mujaffarabad ab bharatiyo ke kabje main jane hi vaala he
 Pakistan launched a new campaign Operation Grand Slam to ease the pressure on Muzaffarabad
 1 sitambar 1965 ko pakistan ne grand slam naamak ek abhiyaan ke tahat samrik drushti se mahatvapurn shahar akhnur jammu or kashmiripar kabje ke liye akraman kar diya
 The purpose of this campaign was to break the Kashmir Valley's connectivity with the rest of India so that its logistics and communication system was disrupted
 pakistan ke is akraman ke liye bharat taiyaar nahin tha or pakistan ko baari sankhya main sainiko or behatar kism ke tanko kaa laabh mil rahaa tha
 In the beginning, India had to face heavy damage, on which the Indian Army used an aerial attack, in response, Pakistan attacked the air base of Punjab and Srinagar
 yuddh ke is charan main pakistan atyadhik behatar sthiti main tha or is apratyaashit hamale se bhartiya kheme main ghabrahat fail gayi thi
 The passing of Akhnoor into the hands of the Pakistani Army could have posed a threat to the Kashmir Valley of India

 Despite the delay of a day, the army chief of the Western Command of India knew that Pakistan was in a very good position and to stop it, he gave a proposal to the then Chief of Army Staff General Chaudhary to open a new front in the Punjab border and attack Lahore
 Be given
 general choudhary is baat se sahamat nahin the lekin tatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shashtri ne unki baat ansuni kar is hamale kaa aadesh de diya
 On September 6, India crossed the international border and attacked the Western Front and made the official start of the war

 The Ichogil Canal was the de facto border of India and Pakistan
 is hamale main khud major general prasad ke kafile par bhi hamalaa hua or unhe apana vaahan chhod kar bhaagna padaa
 India succeeded in crossing the canal near Barki village in retaliation

 Meanwhile, Pakistan attacked Khemkaran to reduce the pressure on Lahore and captured it
 In return, India attacked Bedi and its surrounding villages
 6 sitambar ko lahore par hamale main bhartiya sena ke pratham paidal sainya khand ke saath dwitiya bakhtarband upkhand ke teen tanks daste shaamil the
 They immediately crossed the border and reached the Ichogil Canal, the Pakistan Army deployed defense teams on the bridges, the bridges which could not be saved were blown up, this move of Pakistan stopped the Indian army moving forward
 jat regiment kii ek ikai 3 jat ne nahar paar karke dograi or batapore par kabja kar liya
 On the same day, the Pakistan Army, with the help of armored unit and air force, made a large counter attack on the 15th section of the Indian Army, although it caused only minor damage to the 3 Jats but the 15th segment had to retreat and its logistics and weapons vehicles were severely damaged
 bhartiya sena ke bade adhikario ko jamini halaat kii sahi jaankaree nahin thi atah unhone is ashanka se ki 3 jat ko bhi baari nuksaan hua he use peeche hatane kaa aadesh de diya isse 3 jat ke kaman aadhikari ko badi niraashaa hui or baad main unhe dograi par phir kabja karne ke liye badi keemat chukaani padi
 On 8 December 1965, a squad of 5 Maratha Light Infantry was sent to strengthen the Rajasthan Military Force stationed at Munabav, a strategically important town
 unako pakistani sena ke paidal dste ko aage badhane se rokane kaa aadesh mila tha par ve keval apni chaowkee kii raksha hi kar paye pakistani sena ke topakhane se hui baari bambaari or hawaii or paidal sainya akraman ke bich 5 maratha ke jawaano ne badi veerta kaa parichay diya parinaam swaroop aaj us chaowkee kly maratha hill ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 5 3 Gurkhas and 954 heavy artillery squad sent to help Maratha could not reach due to heavy attack of Pakistani Air Force and Tran coming from Barmer after taking logistics also became an attack near Garda Road Rail Base 10 September Munabao was captured by Pakistan
 9 sitambar ke baad kii ghatnaon ne dono deshon kii senaao ke sabase garvit khando kaa dambh chur chur kar diya
 The 1st Armored Division of India, called the Pride of the Indian Army, attacked in the direction of Sialkot
 chhavinda main pakistan kii apekshaakrit kamjor 6 bakhtarband khand ne buree tarah haraa diya bhartiya sena ko kareeb kareeb 100 tanks gavaane pade or peeche hatane par majaboor hona padaa
 Encouraged by this, Pakistan's army attacked the Indians and entered further into the Indian border
 apane antim aakraamak ke liye pakistan apane pehla bakhtarband divijan or 11vaan infantry divijan ke saath amritsar par kabje ke iraade se khemkaran par hamalaa kar diya
 According to him, after Amritsar, according to the statement from Jalandhar and then President Ayub Khan, Delhi would be the next target
 pakistani sena khemkaran se aage babbti hi ki asal uttar gaanv ) ke paas bharat kaa chauthaa mountain divijan, 7 mountain brigade, 62 mountain brigade, shermen tanks se susajjit deccan horse, apane anya divijan ke saath yuddh ke liye khada tha
 And here, between them, the second largest tank battle was fought after World War, in which Pakistan suffered a tremendous defeat
 usne apane 97 tanks kho diye, jisamen 72 paton tanks shaamil the; iske alaava 32 tanks chalati haalat main kabja kar liya gaya
 Where before, the advancing Pakistani army lost in the war of the real north, the balance of war was tilted in favor of India
 iske baad yah jagah america main bane paton naam ke pakistani tanko ke upar paton nagar ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After this battle, Pakistan's first armored division was sent back to Sialkot where it did not participate further in the war
 is samay tak yuddh main tehraav aa gaya tha or dono desh apane dwaara jite hue ilaako kii raksha main zyada dhyaan de rahe the
 In the battle 3000 Indian Army and 3800 Pakistani Army soldiers were martyred
 bharat ne yuddh main 710 varg kilometre ilaake main or pakistan ne 210 varg kilometre ilaake main kabja kar liya tha
 The Indian state had fertile areas of Sialkot, Lahore and Kashmir, while Pakistan occupied the barren areas of Sindh and Chamba
 is yuddh main aazaadee ke baad pehali baar bhartiya vaayu sena evam pakistani vaayu sena ke vimaanon ne ek dusre kaa muqabla kiya
 Earlier, both of these air forces participated in the First Kashmir War in the 1940s, in which their contribution was much less and limited to transportation as compared to 1965 war
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke paas badi sankhya main hoker hunter, bharat main nirmit folland nait, de havilland vempaire, i i canberra bamavarshak or mig-21 kii ek squadran thi
 The Pakistani Air Force's fadter planes were 102 F-86F sabers and 12 F-104 starfighters, and 24 B-57 Canberra bombers
 sangharsh ke dauraan bharat or pakistan vaayu senaaon kaa anupaat 5:1 tha
 However, the two air forces were similar in the war, as most of the Indian Air Force was stationed east to avoid the possibility of China entering the war
 pakistani vimaan zyaadaatar america the, jabaki bharat ke paas soviet va europea vimaanon kaa mila jula bedaa tha
 It was widely circulated that Pakistan's American aircraft are better than Indian aircraft, but according to some experts this was not correct as the Indian Air Force's mig-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Nate fighter's performance from their rival Pakistan's F-86 Saber Was better
 yuddh main pakistan kii nan0 19 squadran kaa netritv karne vaale air commander sajaad haidar ke anusaar- haalaanki bhartiya vayusena ke vempaire fiter vimaan F-86 saibar ke mukaable puraane or kamazor the, lekin hunter vimaan shakti evam gati donon main hi unase behatar the
 According to Indians, the F-86 was weak in front of the small Folland Nate, causing these aircraft to be called "saber destroyers"
 pakistan vayusena kaa F-104 starfiter upmahadweep main us samay kaa sabase tej gati kaa fiter vimaan tha or use praayah "pakistan vayusena kaa garv" kaha jaataa tha
 But according to Sajjad Haider, those aircraft did not deserve this honor because they were made with the "purpose of stopping and combating Soviet bombers flying at an altitude of more than 40,000 feet", not with low-speed fighter aircraft
 To fight
 atah ye us samay ke maahaul ke upyukt nahin the
 "the Indian Air Force was worried because of Starfighter, but they did not prove to be as effective in combat as the slower but more agile, Folland Nat Fighter
 phir bhi saibar or nats ke bich chale dwand yuddh main supersonic gati ke saath, saibar kahi zyada safal rahaa
 Both countries have made contrary claims to each other about the losses incurred in the fighting and few neutral sources have verified them
 pakistani vayusena kaa daawa tha ki usne bharat ke 104 vimaan giraae or apane 19 vimaan khoe, jabaki bhartiya vayusena ne daawa kiya ki unhone pakistan ke 73 vimaan giraae or apane 35 vimaan khoe
 According to a neutral source, the Pakistani Air Force flew 86 F-86 Sabers, 10 F-104 Starfighters, and 20 B-57 Canberra aircraft in a parade held shortly after the end of the war, claiming that the Indian Air Force had dropped 73 Pakistani aircraft
 It seems to be wrong, which was almost the entire first line of fighter jets of Pakistan at that time
 pakistan vayusena ke keval ek squadran ko khone ke daavon ko, bhartiya sutron ne nakaarte hue bataaya he ki, pakistan ne shuruuaati yuddh ke 10 dinon ke bheetar hi indonesia, iraq, iran, turki or china se atirikt vimaan hasil karne kii maang kii thi
 According to independent sources, the PAF had lost some 20 aircraft while the Indians had lost 60–75 aircraft
 pakistan ne yuddh kii samaapti tak apni 17 pratishat agrim pankti kii takat kho di, jabaki bharat kaa nuksaan 10 pratishat se bhi kam tha
 In addition, it is estimated that if the conflict had continued for three weeks, the Pakistani losses would have increased by 33 percent and India's losses would have been 15 percent
 1965 ke yuddh main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad tinkon ke sabase bade yuddh lade gaye
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armor was largely American-made; It consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; Some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions – the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armored division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armored Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which resulted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armored Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced the same results, India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armored Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armor, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armored Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armored formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defense writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbor
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 Both India and Pakistan made absolutely mismatched claims about the loss of themselves and others
 donon deshon ke daavon kii sankshipt sarini is prakaar he There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agreed that India had an upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below - The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the UN The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time sanyukt raashtra intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, bharat had the better of the war
 nai dilli achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest - it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 square miles of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 square miles of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh ne donon dakshin asian deshon ke bich sangharsh main or vruddhi ko rokane ke liye mahatvapurn rajanyik upkaran kaa upyog kiya
 The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexi Kossian, hosted a ceasefire talks in Tashkent, where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, withdrawing forces from 25 February 1966 onwards in pre-august Agreed to
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, bharat budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the sanyukt raashtra Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war - which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India - and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, bharat reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 disambar killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 farvari 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hui kai ranneetik galatiyon ke kaaran yah yuddh benatija si sthiti main aa pahunchaa
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal PC Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian Army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defense and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian Army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game - conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defense Analysis, USA
 The exercise awaited that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military 


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani air marshall va commander in chif of PAF during the war, nur khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, bharat agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, bharat was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's obvious to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, India's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further substantial damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates - India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, India focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, India established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defense Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defense of Lahore against the Indian Army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realized the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority - if not invincibility - of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, bharat did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971

 Many eminent teachers came out of this college

 To establish their rule in India, the officers of the East India Company thought in necessary to preserve the knowledge of Hindus and Muslims
 In the year 1750 they passed a resolution for that purpose
 To preserve Urdu, they established a Madarsa at Calcutta, whereas for protection and development of Sanskrit, they chose Benares
 In 1791, during the period of British rule in India, Jonathan Duncan, the representative of the Honourable East India Company proposed the establishment of a Sanskrit college for development and preservation of the Sanskrit Vangmaya and to show that the English people were in favor of the development of the Indian culture
 This was sanctioned by Governor General Lord Cornwallis
 Kashi Naresh Mahip Narayan Singh donated a huge tract of land in the southern part of Benares for construction of the college
 The first teacher of this Institution was Pandit Kashinath
 The Governor General initially sanctioned a budget of Rs
 20,000 per annum
 Initially the college offered courses up to graduation
 From 1857, the College started Postgraduate teaching

 Water-based surfaces also have less friction than the sand-based variety and therefore reduce the level of injury to the players when they come into contact with the surface
 FIH are now proposing that new surfaces being placed should be a hybrid variety that requires less water

 Sticks are forbidden from use in metal hockey

 There is traditionally a slight stick face down to the side and another 'heel' on the edge to the top of the handle, which aided in positioning the wood head in relation to the ball and striking the ball easily and more accurately Made it

 a fully equipped goalkeeper must wear a helmet, leg guard and kickers
 Usually they wear safety equipment including wide extra chest guards, padded shorts, heavy padded hand protectors, blind guard, neck guards, arm guards and like all players, one should carry wood
 However, the only exception for taking a penalty stroke is such a player cannot cross the 23 meter line, if the field goalkeeper is going to the other end of the clock when the clock is stopped
 Goalkeepers can also take off their helmets for this action
 haalanki, agar golkeeper elects keval ek, ve 23 meter line paar agar ve khel ke maidan se baahar surakshit apane ho saktaa he
 If the helmet for them returns to the play cycle, the player still has the opportunity to replace "goalkeeping" privileges, that is, they are not limited to using their stick to play the ball whilst it is in the circle Huh

 Now it is also possible to have a full eleven outfield players of the teams - and no goalkeeper at all
 No player may wear a helmet or other equipment goalkeeping nor will any player be able to play ball other than with his stick
 This can be used to offer a strategic advantage, or to allow play to start or if there is no goalkeeper kit available bharat praveshdwar The politics of India works within the structure of its Constitution, because India is a federal parliamentary, democratic republic, where the President is the head of the country and the Prime Minister is the head of the government

 The third truth is that with the combination of two substances, Jiva and Ajiva, which is called Yoga, Karma drains into the living entity
 yah jeev se chipak jaataa he or karm main badal jaataa he
 The fourth truth is the binding factor, which limits the expression of consciousness
 paanchvaan satya bataata he ki nae karmon kii roak, sahi chaaritra, sahi darshan evam sahi gyaan ke paalan ke madhyam se aatmasanyam dwaara sambhav he
 Existing karmas can also be ignited by deep self-control, this sixth truth is expressed by the word "nirjara"
 antim satya he ki jab jeev karmon ke bandhan se mukt ho jaataa he, to moksh yaa nirvana ko praapt ho jaataa he, jo jain shiksha kaa lakshya he
 According to Jainism, the soul exists as a reality

 Consciousness and usage are the symptoms of an organism

 Death and birth only signifies the end of one stage of life and the beginning of the next
 karmon kii aamad ko asrav kehate hai
 This happens when karma particles are attracted to the soul due to the vibrations generated by the movements of mind, dialogue and body
 According to Tattvarthasutra 6: 1-2, "mind, dialogue and body movements are called yoga
" in teen kriyaaon ke kaaran asrav yaa karmon kii aamad hoti he
 " karmon kaa asar chetana se judne par hi hota he
 This bond of actions with consciousness is called Bandha
 haalaanki, keval yoga yaa gatividhiyon ke madhyam se hi bandha nahin hota
 Among the many reasons for bandha, raga is the main reason

 The restriction of deeds is called as marriage

 There are two types of nijra - aatma kii mukti yaa karmon se chhutkaaraa ko moksh kehete hai
 It is the blissful state of the soul's existence, which is completely free from the bondage of actions, the world, and the cycle of birth and death
 ek mukt aatma apane sachhee or mul prakruti- anant sukh, anant gyaan or anant darshan ko paa leti he

 Knowledge of the divine form through knowledge, knowledge of real truth is the goal of Jnana Yoga

 Now, if analyzed, the Jnana actually attains liberation by knowing the real element of Mayaism, knowing his reality and the true nature of the soul in accordance with the Vedanta's Advaita doctrine

 Devanagari is an Indian script in which many Indian languages and many foreign languages are written
 yah baayen se daayen likhi jaati he
 It is identified by a horizontal line known as 'shirirekha'
 sanskrit, pali, hindi, marathi, konkani, sindhi, kashmiri, dogri, khas, nepal bhashaa, tamaque bhashaa, gadhwali, bodo, angika, magahi, bhojpuri, maithili, santhali aadi bhashaayen devanagari main likhi jaati hai
 Additionally, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bishnupuria Manipuri, Romani and Urdu languages are also written in Devanagari in some cases
 devanagari vishwa main sarvaadhik prayukt lipiyon main se ek he
 Like most languages, Devanagari is written from left to right
 prayek shabd ke upar ek rekha khinchi hoti he ise shirorekha kehete hai
 Devanagari has evolved from the Brahmi script
 yah ek dhvanyatmak lipi he jo prachlit lipiyon main sabase adhik vaigyanik he
 From this the scientific and comprehensive script is probably only Adhva script
 bharat kii kai lipiyaan devanagari se bahut adhik milti-julati hai, jaise- bangla, gujarati, gurumukhi aadi
 With the help of computer programs, interchange of Indian scripts has become very easy
 bhartiya bhashaaon ke kisi bhi shabd yaa dhwani ko devanagari lipi main jyon kaa tyon likhaa ja saktaa he or phir likhe paath ko lagbhag 'hu-ba-hu' uccharan kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki roman lipi or anya kai lipiyon main sambhav nahin he, jab tak ki unka vishesh maanakeekaran na kiya jaye, jaise itrans yaa ieesti
 It has a total of 52 letters, with 14 vowels and 38 consonants
 aksharon kii kram vyavastha bhi bahut hi vaigyanik he
 Classification of vowel-consonant, soft-hard, hypnotic-hypnotic, resonant-antasthe-heat, etc
 are also scientific
 ek mat ke anusaar devnagar me prachlan ke kaaran iskaa naam devanagari padaa
 The indications of many scripts in India and Asia are different from Devanagari, but the pronunciation and alphabet are the same as Devanagari, because they all originated from the Brahmi script
 isliye in lipiyon ko paraspar aasaani se lipyantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Devanagari is simple in terms of writing, beautiful in terms of beauty and legible in reading
 bhartiya ankon ko unki vaigyaniktaa ke kaaran vishwa ne saharsha sweekaar kar liya he
 The use of the name Devanagari or Nagari began with "why" and what was its etymological tendency - it is not yet completely certain
 'nagar' apbhransh yaa gujarati "nagar" brahmanon se uskaa sambandh bataaya gaya he
 But in the absence of strong evidence, this opinion is doubtful
 dakshin main iskaa pracheen naam "nandinagari" tha
 May be "nandinagar" is a locative and this script has something to do with it
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki "nagar" jan isamen likhaa karte the, at: "nagari" abhidhaan padaa or jab sanskrit ke granth bhi isamen likhe jane lage tab "devanagari" bhi kaha gaya
 Symbols or triangles, chakras, etc
 used in the worship of gods were called "devanagar"
 kalantar main naam ke prathamaksharon kaa unase bodh hone laga or jis lipi main unako sthaan mila- vah 'devanagari' yaa 'nagari' kahi gai
 At the core of all these aspects is the predominance of imagination, conclusive evidence is unavailable
 bharat devanagari lipi kii kshamta se shatabdiyon se parichit rahaa he
 According to Dr
 Dwarka Prasad Saxena, the first use of Devanagari script is found in the inscription of Naib Jayabhatta of Gujarat
 aathvin shatabdi main chitrakoot, naveen main baroda ke dhruvaraj bhi apane rajyadeshon main is lipi kaa upyog kiya karte the
 The Samagadha Tamrapat of Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga of 758 AD is found on which Devanagari is inscribed
 shilaharvansh ke ganndraditya ke utkeern lekh kii lipi devanagari he
 Its time is eleventh century, Cholaraja Rajendra coins of this time have been found on which the Devanagari script is inscribed
 rashtrakut raja indraraj ke lekh main bhi devanagari kaa vyavhaar kiya he
 The donation letter of Pratihara king Mahendrapal is also in Devanagari script

 The Devanagari script is treated with the idol of Lakshmi on the coins of Muhammad Vinsam
 shamshuddin iltutamish ke sikkon par bhi devanagari ankit he
 Sanuddin Ferozeshah I, Jalaluddin Razia, Bahram Shah, Alaluddin Marudshah, Naseeruddin Mahmood, Muizuddin, gayasuddin Balvan, Muizuddin Kaikubad, Jalaluddin Hero Sani, Alauddin Mahmad Shah etc
 have inscribed Devanagari letters on their coins
 akbar ke sikkon par devanagari main ‘ram‘ siya kaa naam ankit he
 Gaiyasuddin Tughlaq, Sher Shah Suri, Islam Shah, Muhammad Adilshah, Ghiyasuddin Ibj, Ghiyasuddin Sani etc
 followed the same tradition
 brahmi or devanagari lipi : bhashaa ko lipiyon main likhane kaa prachlan bharat main hi shuru hua
 Sumerian, Babylonian and Greek people learned it from India
 prachinkaal main brahmi or devanagari lipi kaa prachlan tha
 Other scripts around the world originated from Brahmi and Devanagari scripts
 brahmi lipi ek pracheen lipi he jisase kai asian lipiyon kaa vikaas hua he
 Brahmi, like Kharoshthi, was spread throughout Asia
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki brahmi lipi 10,000 saal puraani he lekin yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki yah lipi usase bhi zyada puraani he
 Emperor Ashoka also adopted this script: The great emperor Ashoka named the Brahmi script as Dhammalipi
 brahmi lipi ko devanagari lipi se bhi pracheen mana jaataa he
 It is said to be a script derived from the ancient indus-saraswati script
 hadappa samskruti ke log sindhu lipi ke alaav is lipi kaa bhi istemaal karte the, tab sanskrit bhashaa ko bhi isi lipi main likhaa jaataa tha
 In linguistic terms, Devanagari script is considered as alphabetic script
 lipi ke vikassopanon kii drushti se "chitratmak", "bhavatmak" or "bhavchitratmak" lipiyon ke ananthar "aksharatmak" str kii lipiyon kaa vikaas mana jaataa he
 The alphabetic state developed after the alphabetic state of the script due to the opinion of Westerners and many Indian linguists
 sabase viksit avasthaa maani gai he dhvanyatmak lipi kii
 "devanagari" is said to be alphabetical because its characters are letters - vowels and consonants
 "k", "kha" aadi vyanjan saswar hai- akaryukt hai
 They are not only sounds but are aloud
 at: greek, roman aadi varnmalas hai
 But here it is to be kept in mind that the "panini" of the consonants in the sounds of the "brahmi" or "bharati" alphabet of India has been explained by "patanjali" in the 14 formulas of Varnasammanaya
 Is that the use of the vowel "akaar" conjugated in consonants is for the purpose of pronunciation only
 vah tatvat: varna kaa ang nahin he
 Thinking from this point of view it can be said that the alphabet of this script is essentially phonetic, not alphabetic
 devanagari kii varnmaala main 12 swar or 34 vyanjan hai
 a letter is formed by a combination of zero or one or more consonants and a vowel
 nimnlikhit swar aadhunik hindi ke liye diye gayi hai
 Their pronunciation is slightly different in Sanskrit
 sanskrit main i do swaron kaa yugma hota he or "a-i" yaa "aa-i" kii tarah bolaa jaataa he
 Similarly, au is spoken like "a-u" or "a-u"
 iske alaava hindi or sanskrit main ye varnakshar bhi swar maane jate hai : When no vowel is used, 'A' is considered there
 swar ke na hone ko halant athwa viraam se darshaya jaataa he
 Such as KGGH
 hindi bhashaa main mukhyat: arabi or farsi bhashaaon se aaye shabdon ko devanagari main likhane ke liye kuch varnon ke neeche nukta lage varnon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 But in Hindi also most people do not use nuktas
 iske alaava sanskrit, marathi, nepali evam anya bhashaaon ko devanagari main likhane main bhi nukton kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa he
 Th is mainly used in the hill languages, as in Dogri the word for "tear" is "athru"
 hindi main d or dh vyanjan farsi yaa arabi se nahin liye gayi hai, na hi ye sanskrit main paye jaye hai
 In fact, they are the changed forms of ordinary s and d in Sanskrit
 devanagari ank nimna rup main likhe jate hai : In the Devanagari script, two consonants are spelled as follows: brahmi parivaar kii lipiyon main devanagari lipi sabase adhik sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detii he
 Devanagari also supports conjuncts of more than 2 dishes
 chhandas font devanagari main bahut sanyuktakshron ko samarthan detaa he
 Some of the Devanagari characters used in earlier times are different from modern Devanagari
 1

 2

 3

 Seth Govindas was in favor of declaring it a national script
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki bharat main anekon bhashaayen hona koi samasya nahin he jabaki unki lipiyaan alag-alag hona bahut badi samasya he
 Gandhiji printed a Gujarati language book in Devanagari script in 1940 and stated that its dream is that every language emanating from Sanskrit should be scripted in Devanagari

 The spread on it will not be the medium of scriptural imperialism and exploitation but the conductor of lofty human values like truth, non-violence, renunciation, self-control, from unrest to sata, light from tamas and immortality from death
 duniya kii kai bhashaaon ke liye devanagari sabase acha vikalp ho sakati he kyonki yah yah bolne kii puri aazaadee detaa he
 This cannot happen in any other script of the world
 indonesia, vietnam, africa aadi ke liye to yahi sabase sahi rahegaa
 Looking at Ashtadhyayi, one can understand that there is no better script in the world
 agar duniya pakshpatarahit ho to devanagari hi duniya kii sarvamaanya lipi hogi kyonki yah purnat: vaigyanik he
 For effective solution of the spelling problem in English language, Deoghari script based on Devanagari has been proposed

 Just as the world accepted the Indian numerals due to their scientificness, Devanagari will one day become a world class due to its scientificness
 devanagari kaa vikaas us yug main hua tha jab lekhan haath se kiya jaataa tha or lekhan ke liye shilaayein, taadptr, charmpatr, bhojaptr, tamrapatr aadi kaa hi prayog hota tha
 But writing technology has developed a lot and through the printing press, typewriter etc
 it has reached the computer age where it has become possible to write even by speaking
 praudyogiki ke vikaas ke saath kisi bhi lipi ke lekhan main samasyaayen aana pratyaashit he
 For this reason, efforts were also made to improve or standardize from time to time in Devanagari
 bharat ke swadhinata andolanon main hindi ko rashtrabhasha kaa darja praapt hone ke baad lipi ke vikaas va maanakeekaran hetu kai vyaktigat evam sansthagat prayaas hue

 shyamsundar das ne anuswaar ke prayog ko vyapak banaakar devanagari ke sarleekaran ke prayaas kiye
 The role of many institutional efforts has also been very important in the development of Devanagari
 1935 main hindi sahitya sammelan ne nagari lipi sudhaar samiti ke madhyam se barhakhadi or shirorekha se sambandhit sudhaar kiye
 Similarly, in 1947, a committee constituted under the chairmanship of Narendra Dev gave important suggestions related to twelvekhadi, quantity arrangement, anusvara and resonant
 devanagari lipi ke vikaas hetu bharat sarkaar ke shiksha mantralay ne kai staron par prayaas kiye hai
 In 1966, the standard Devanagari alphabet was published and in 1967 'standardization of Hindi spelling' was published
