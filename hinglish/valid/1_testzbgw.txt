 Its two long edges are straight and one side sloping, so that it is possible to draw a straight and correct line
 darsharekhi ke donon siron par do drishy-vedhikaaye yaa pattiyaan lagi rahati hai
 a leaf is cut in the middle of one leaf, from which the surveyor looks at his target and threads a thread between the other leaf and ends at the ends of both leaves
 ek pattee main kati zairi, duusare main piroyaa or pattiyon ke siron par tana dhaagaa is prakaar rakhe jate hai ki vah ek hi samtal main paden
 When the viewer is placed on the horizontal plane, the thread and thread will be perpendicular to the bottom of the board
 yadi zairi se jhaankakar dhaage se katataa koi bhi dur kaa bindu yaa vastu dekhi jaae to darsharekhi prekshak kii sthiti se us bindu yaa vastu kii disha batayega
 If the paper is overlaid on the platenbul and the position of the observer is marked on it, at that time, the side of the spectator is kept touching the position on the observer's paper and through the line on the tangent edge of the spectator by seeing an object or point on the thread
 When pulled, it will be the direction of the object or point, called a ray, from the position of the observer
 yahi kriya kisi duusari sthiti se dohraane par ek hi bindu kii do sthitiyon se do kirane aapas main katkar pratichchhed bindu par uski sahi saapeksh sthiti de dengi
 Magnetic compasses are made in a rectangular, glass-covered, brass wax by suspending a needle of magnet on a nail

 This is called spirit levil or telemetry
 yadi spirit levil tipai par kase chitrapatal par rakhaa jaae or tipai ke pair aise jamaa die jaaen ki talamaapi ko kisi bhi do samakon dishaao main planetebul par rakhane se uskaa bulbula kendrit rahe to planetebul kshaitij ho jaataa he
 Due to not being horizontal, the drawn rays of the points would be wrong mainly because they are located very high or below
 at: binduon kii sahi saapeksh sthitiyaan praapt nahin hongi
 Points, whose regulators are known, are plotted on the desired scale, located in the area for survey, on a graded paper
 yah kaagaj planetebul par madh diya jaataa he
 There are several ways of paper mounting
 yadi surveykshan kaary bahut thode samay kaa ho to kaagaj batan pinon se takhte par madh diya jaataa he
 If there is a survey of one or two weeks, in which the paper is necessary to remain absolutely stable, then by placing a strong thin paper skirting or maggi on all the four sides of the paper, you stick the enlarged portion of that skirting firmly on the table
 lambii avadhi tak chalanevaale surveykshan, yaa jisamen kaagaj kaa purnataya sthir rahanaa aavashyak ho usamen, kaagaj ko patal se lagbhag 15 senmi
 adhik lambey or chaude kapade par chipka dete hai
 The cloth is then pulled firmly onto the surface of the plantebul
 jab kapade par chipka kaagaj planetebul par lagaate hai to kaagaj par vargankan or niyantran vinduon kaa aalekhan kaagaj ko patal par madhne ke baad karte hai
 Thereafter, in the area where the survey is to be conducted, the surveyor takes a plantebul to a control point located in it, which is marked on its paper
 aise vindu ko stesan kehete hai
 The tripod is placed almost horizontally over the station with its legs stretched and the board tightened
 usapar talamaapi ko do krmanugat samakon sthitiyon main rakhkar tipai ke pairon ko aise jamaaya jaataa he ki bulbula kendrit rahe
 This makes the planetbulb horizontal
 iske baad diksthaapan kiya jaataa he
 Displacement is the condition of the planetbulb when the lines connecting the control points on the image of the platenbul to the paper become parallel to the lines connecting the same points on the earth
 yah dasha praapt karne ke liye surveykshak nimna kriya karata he : kalpana karen, surveykshak bhoomi par bane a vindu par khadaa he jisaki kaagaj par lagi a sthit he
 Similarly, if the physical and graphical positions of each other point are b and b, respectively, the surveyor places one edge of his viewer so that he is tangent to a and b, the threaded target-piercer to b and the jagged target-piercer a
 Stay towards tab vah planetebul ko tipai par aise ghumata he ki darsharekhi kii zairi se b bindu dhaage par katataa dikhaai de
 On attaining such condition, he tightens the plantables
 is prakaar patalchitr apni sahi kii dishaao main sthapit ho jaataa he
 In this case, if the position of the visible director edge surveyor is kept touching a and any other graphical point, the geometric position of the point seen will be cut on the thread
 yah smaraneey he ki zairi sadaiv prekshak kii ore tathaa dhaage vaali drishyvedhika dekhe gaye vindu kii ore rahegi
 In the above case, by drawing a panel, the surveyor, using his pencil on his graphical position a point, sees the edge of the viewer touching the point, cuts the other points on the thread in the jharoka and draws rays towards them
 aisi kirane vah un sabhi vinduon kii ore khinchataa he jinhen vah maanchitr par darshana chahta he, jaise gaanv, nadi, sadakon aadi ke mode or sangam
 The turning point and the confluence point is the leader because the right part can also be formed through lines joining the point
 yahi kriya vah duusare steshnon par doharaat he
 This will cut the rays of the same point given from any two positions together, giving the correct relative position of the point at intersection
 yah sthitiyaan usee paimaane par hongi jisapar chaandon kaa aalekhan hoga
 This is called the intersection method of snapping
 yadi kirane khinchakar, unheen vinduon kii kramash: duuri naapakar, kiran par paimaane se kaat lee jaae to bhi sahi vindu praapt ho jaataa he
 This is called the radiation method of survey
 kisi nadi, nahar, maarg aadi rekhak chizon ke kinare sthit ek stesan se dur sthit adrishy stesan tak krmanugat kirane dekar duuri naapakar, vindu lagaate hue unka surveykshan ho to use chankraman surveykshan kehete hai
 The surveyor makes the shapes of the objects by mixing the cut points with lines
 maanchitr ko dekhakar bhoomi par or bhoomi se maanchitr par bani vastuon ko pahchaanane ke liye sankethik chihnon kaa vah prayog karata he, jisase saamaan akritiyon main bhi vibhedan ho sake
 For example, in place of canals, roads, railways, etc
, only lines will be formed, but the surveyor is able to draw them in different colors and ways to convince others
 vinduon ke bich kii saapeksh unchaaiyaan surveykshak samocch rekhaon se pradarshit karata he
 For this, the process of drafting is best
 bhoomi saamne he or maapan, aalekhan or chithran kriyaayein saath saath chalati jaati hai
 a thermometer is used to find relative heights
 is yantra se prekshak apni sthiti par kisi bhi duusare vindu kii oonchaai main bhinnata ke kaaran bane kone kaa sidhaa sparshajya pard saktaa he
 One can find the distance of that point from the plate by itself and then find the relative height of that point
 is prakaar sabhi vinduon kii saapeksh unchaaiyaan gyaat kar letaa he
 Heights are measured from a base to maintain uniformity in relative heights drawn from different positions of the surveyor
 yah aadharatal saamanyat: jowar bhaate kaa dhyaan rakhkar naape gaye samudr kaa ausat tal mana jaataa he
 The line connecting the points located at the same height from this plane is called the contour line
 ise khinchakar surveykshak oonchaai kaa abhas karaata he

 1939 main 13 nijee companiyon ke vilay dwaara astitv main aayi yah motor company swatantrata purv kumaun kshetra main basen chalaane vaali ekmaatr bas company thi
 By 1987, it was the largest bus company in the region

 After this, motor traffic started between kathgodam-almora in 1920 AD

 The Jallianwala Bagh massacre on 13 April 1919 in Amritsar had a profound impact on Bhagat Singh's thinking
 lahore ke neshnal cholez kii padhai chhodkar bhagat singh ne bharat kii azaadi ke liye noujvaan bharat sabha kii sthapana kii thi
 In the Kakori case, Bhagat Singh was so caught up with the execution of four revolutionaries including Ram Prasad 'bismil' and imprisonment on 16 others that Pandit Chandrashekhar Azad joined his party Hindustan Republican Association and gave him a new name Hindustan Socialist Republican Association

 Bhagat Singh was around twelve years old when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place
 isaki soochna milte hi bhagat singh apane skool se 12 mile paidal chalakar jalianwala baag pahunch gayi
 At this age, Bhagat Singh used to read the revolutionary books of his uncles and wondered whether their path was right? After the non-cooperation movement of Gandhiji broke, he began to choose for himself from the non-violent ways of Gandhiji and the violent movement of revolutionaries
 gandhi ji ke asahyog aandolan ko radd kar dene ke kaaran unamem thodaa rosh utpann hua, par puure raashtra kii tarah wo bhi mahatma gandhi kaa sammaan karte the
 But he did not consider it unfair to adopt the path of violent revolution for the freedom of the country instead of Gandhiji's non-violent movement
 unhone juluson main bhaag lenaa prarambh kiya tathaa kai krantikari dalon ke sadsy bane
 Among the prominent revolutionaries of his party were Chandrashekhar Azad, Sukhdev, Rajguru etc

 Chandrashekhar Azad cautioned him - "I will shoot if i go ahead

 In this way these people avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai

 However, he was also a strong feeder of socialism
 kalaantar main unke virdohi dwaara unako apane vichaardhaara bataa kar yuvaao ko bhagat singh ke naam par bargalane ke aarope lagate rahe he
 Despite Congress being in power, Bhagat Singh did not get the status of Congress martyr, as he only used Bhagat Singh's name to connect the youth with his party
 unhen poonjipatiyon kii mazdooron ke prati shoshan kii niti pasand nahin aati thi
 At that time, since the British were the only surveyors and very few Indian industrialists could make progress, their opposition to the atrocities against the British workers was natural
 majdoor virdohi aisi nitiyon ko british sansad main paarit na hone dena unke dal kaa nirnay tha
 Everybody wanted that the British should know that Hindustani has woken up and there is a resentment towards such policies in their heart
 aisa karne ke liye hi unhone dilli kii kendriya essembali main bam phenkane kii yojana banaayi thi
 Bhagat Singh wanted it to not have any bloodshed and that his 'voice' could also reach the British
 haalaanki prarambh main unke dal ke sab log aisa nahin sochate the par ant main sarvasammati se bhagat singh tathaa batukeshwar dutt kaa naam chunaa gaya
 As per schedule, on April 8, 1929, both of them threw bombs in the Central Assembly at a place where no one was present, otherwise they could get hurt
 puraa haal dhuen se bhar gaya
 Bhagat Singh could have run away if he wanted, but he had already thought that he accepts punishment even if he is hanged; Therefore, he refused to run
 us samay ve donon khaaki kameez tathaa nikar pahane hue the
 After the bomb exploded, he said "inquilab-zindabad, imperialism-murdabad!" The slogan was raised and the leaflets brought with him bounced in the air
 iske kuch hi der baad police aa gayi or donon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Bhagat Singh spent about 2 years in jail
 is dauraan ve lekh likhakar apane krantikari vichaar vyakt karte rahe
 His studies continued while in prison
 unke us dauraan likhe gayi lekh va sage sambandhiyon ko likhe gayi patr aaj bhi unke vichaaron ke darpan hai
 In his articles he has described the capitalists as his enemy in many ways
 unhone likhaa ki mazdooron kaa shoshan karne vaala chahen ek bhartiya hi kyon na ho, vah unka shatru he
 He also wrote an article in English in prison titled Why am i an atheist? In prison, Bhagat Singh and his colleagues conducted a hunger strike for 64 days
 unke ek saathi yatindranath das ne to bhukh hadtaal main apane praan hi tyaag diye the
 On August 26, 1930, the court convicted Bhagat Singh under sections 129, 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 4 and 6F of the Explosive Substances Act and section 120 of the IPC
 7 aktubar, 1930 ko adaalat ke dwaara 68 prishthon kaa nirnay diya, jisamen bhagat singh, sukhdev tathaa raajaguru ko faansee kii sajaa sunai gai
 Section 144 was imposed in Lahore with the execution of the sentence
 iske baad bhagat singh kii faansee kii maafee ke liye privi parishad main apil daayar kii gai parantu yah apil 10 janvari, 1931 ko radd kar di gai
 After this, the then Congress President Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya filed an appeal before the Viceroy on 14 February 1931 for forgiveness of sentence, using his privilege to waive his death sentence on the basis of humanity
 bhagat singh kii faansee kii sazaa maaf karwaane hetu mahatma gandhi ne 17 farvari 1931 ko vysarai se baat kii phir 18 farvari, 1931 ko aam janata kii ore se bhi vysarai ke saamne vibhinn tarko ke saath sajaa maafee ke liye apil daayar kii
 All this was happening against the wishes of Bhagat Singh because Bhagat Singh did not want his sentence to be forgiven
 23 march 1931 ko shaam main kareeb 7 bajkar 33 minute par bhagat singh tathaa inke do saathiyon sukhdev va raajaguru ko phaansi de di gai
 He was reading Lenin's biography before going on the gallows and when asked about his last wish, he said that he was reading Lenin's biography and that he should be given time to do it
 kaha jaataa he ki jail ke adhikariyon ne jab unhen yah soochna di ki unke phaansi kaa vakt aa gaya he to unhone kaha tha- "tehriye! pehle ek krantikari duusare se mil to le
 "then a minute later the book bounced towards the ceiling and said -" Okay now come on
 " While going on the gallows, the three were singing with joy - phaansi ke baad kahin koi aandolan na bhadak jaye iske dar se angrejon ne pehle inke mrit sharir ke tukade kiye phir ise boriyon main bharkar ferozepur kii ore le gayi jahaan ghi ke badale mitti kaa tel daalkar hi inako jalaayaa jane laga
 When the people of the village saw the fire burning, they came closer
 isse darkar angrejon ne inaki laash ke adhjale tukdon ko sutluj nadi main phenkaa or bhaag gayi
 When the villagers came near, they collected pieces of their dead bodies and duly cremated them
 or bhagat singh hameshaa ke liye amar ho gayi
 After this, people began to consider Gandhian as well as Gandhian responsible for his death
 is kaaran jab gandhi congress ke lahore adhiveshan main hissaa lene ja rahe the to logon ne kaale jhandon ke saath gandhiji kaa swaagat kiya
 Gandhi was also attacked on a few occasions, but was saved by the police running with him in plain uniform
 jail ke dinon main unke likhe khaton va lekhon se unke vichaaron kaa andaja lagata he
 He expressed grief over the distances in Indian society due to script, caste and religion
 unhone samaaj ke kamjor varg par kisi bhartiya ke prahaar ko bhi usee sakhti se sochaa jitna ki kisi angrej ke dwaara kiye gayi atyaachaar ko
 Bhagat Singh knew Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and English as well as Bangla, which he learned from Batukeshwar Dutt
 unka vishwaas tha ki unki shahadat se bhartiya janata or udign ho jaayegi or aisa unke jinda rahane se shaayad hi ho paye
 That is why he refused to write an apology even after he sentenced him to death
 pan0 ram prasad 'bismil' ne apni aatmakatha main jo-jo disha-nirdesh diye the, bhagat singh ne unka aksharsh: paalan kiya
 He also wrote a letter to the British government, stating that he should be considered as a prisoner of war against the British government and instead of being hanged, he should be shot
 phaansi ke pehle 3 march ko apane bhai kultar ko bheje ek patr main bhagat singh ne likhaa tha - They care about this, what is the new tarz-e-zafa? We have this hobby, see what is the beginning of the season? dahar se kyon kafa rahen, charkh kaa kya gila karen
 Sara, where Adu is right, come! Compete
 
 His zeal can be inferred from these zealous lines
 chandrasekhar aaazaad se pehali mulaakaat ke samay jalati hui mombati par haath rakhkar unhone kasam khaayi thi ki unki jindagi desh par hi qurbaan hogi or unhone apni vah kasam puri kar dikhaayi
 "someone has told the truth, old men cannot improve

 Improvements are made through the hard work, courage, sacrifice and loyalty of the youth, who do not know to be afraid and who think less and experience more
 â~ bhagat singh The news of his death was published by the Daily Tribune of Lahore and a Daily Worker letter from New York
 iske baad bhi kai marxvaadi patron main un par lekh chape, par chunki bharat main un dinon marxvaadi patron ke aane par pratibandh laga tha isliye bhartiya buddhijiviyon ko isaki khabar nahin thi
 His martyrdom was remembered throughout the country
 dakshin bharat main periyar ne unke lekh "main naastik kyon hoon?" par apane saptahik patr kudai arasu ke 22-29 march 1931 ke ank main tamil main sampadakeey likhaa
 Bhagat Singh was praised in this and his martyrdom was seen as a victory over British imperialism
 aaj bhi bharat or pakistan kii janata bhagat singh ko azaadi ke diwane ke rup main dekhati he jisane apni javaani sahit sari jindagi desh ke liye samarpit kar di
 His life inspired the characters of many Hindi films

 Muhammad bin Qasim was an Arab warlord of the Umayyad Khilafat during the early period of Islam
 usne 17 saal kii umr main bhartiya upmahadweep ke pashchimi ilaaqon par hamalaa bolaa or sindhu nadi ke saath lage sindh or punjab kshetron par qabza kar liya
 This campaign is considered to be a fundamental event of the coming Muslim rule in the Indian subcontinent
 mohammad bin qaasim kaa janm aadhunik saudi arab main sthit tif shahar main hua tha
 He was a member of al-saqif clan of that area
 uske pita qaasim bin yusuf kaa jald hi dehanth ho gaya or uske taaoo hajjaj bin yusuf ne use yuddh or prashasan kii kalaon se avgat karaayaa
 He married Zubaidah, the daughter of Hajjaj, and was then sent off to attack Sindh by way of the Makran coast
 mohammad bin qaasim ke bhartiya abhiyaan ko hajjaj kufa ke shahar main baitha niyantrit kar rahaa tha
 In 710 AD, Muhammad bin Qasim set out from the city of Shiraz in Iran, carrying 6,000 Syrian soldiers and other squads
 makraan main vahaan ke rajyapal ne use or sainik die
 At that time, the rule of Arabs was new to Makran and he also had to crush rebellions in Fannazabur and Armaan Bella while going east
 phir ve kishtiyon se sindh ke aadhunik karachi shahar ke paas sthit deble kii bandargah par pahunche, jo us jamaane main sindh kii sabase mahatvapurn bandargah thi
 Sindh was ruled by the Hindu King Dahir Sen
 deble pahunchakar unhone sthaneey pujaariyon or nagarikon ko maaraa or vahaan kaa mahaan mandir nasht kiya
 From Debal, Arab forces marched east and crushed cities like Nerun and Sehwan on the way
 yahan unhone bahut bandi banaae or unhen gulam banaakar baari sankhya main hajjaj or caliph ko bheja
 Many treasures were also sent and some were divided among soldiers
 baatcheet karke arabon ne kuch sthaneey jaaton ko bhi apane saath mila liya
 Across the Indus River, Rohri had Dahir Sen's forces defeated
 daahir sen kii mrityu ho gai or mohammad bin qaasim kaa sindh par qabza ho gaya
 Dahir Sen's relatives were enslaved and sent to Hajjaj

 To avoid the confusion caused by the ambiguity of sin â 1, the reciprocals and inverses of trigonometric functions are often displayed as in this table
 In representing the cosecant function, the longer form 'cosec' is sometimes used in place of 'csc'
 Different angular measures can be appropriate in different situations
 This table shows some of the more common systems
radians is the default angular measure and is the one you use if you use the exponential definitions
 All angular measures are unitless
 From the two identities above, the following table can be extrapolated
 Note however that these conversion equations may not provide the correct sign
 For example, if sin Î¸ = 1 / 2, the conversion in the table indicates that cos â¡ Î¸ = 1 - sin 2 â¡ Î¸ = 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ cos \ theta \ , = \ , { \ sqrt { 1- \ sin ^ {2} \ theta}} = { \ sqrt {3}} / 2}, though it is possible that cos â¡ Î¸ = - 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ cos \ theta \ , = \ , - { \ sqrt {3}} / 2}
 More information would be needed about which quadrant Î¸ lies in to determine a single, exact answer
 Rarely used today, the versine, coversine, haversine, and exsecant have been defined as below and used in navigation, for example the haversine formula was used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere
 By examining the unit circle, we can establish the following properties of trigonometric functions: When the trigonometric functions are reflected from certain values of Î¸ { \ displaystyle \ theta }, The result is often one of the other trigonometric functions
 This leads to the following identities: By shifting the function round by certain angles, it is often possible to find different trigonometric functions that express the result more simply
 Some examples of this are given shown by shifting functions round by Ï / 2, Ï and 2Ï radians
 Because the periods of these functions are either Ï or 2Ï, there are cases where the new function is exactly the same as the old function without the shift

 These can be proved very easily with the help of Euler's formula
 x Â± y = a Â± b â x + y = a + b and x â y = a â b { \ displaystyle { \ begin{aligned}x \ pm y=a \ pm b& \ Rightarrow \ x+y=a+b \ \ &{ \ mbox{and}} \ x-y=a-b \ end{aligned}}} x Â± y = a â b â x + y = a â b and x â y = a + b { \ displaystyle { \ begin{aligned}x \ pm y=a \ mp b& \ Rightarrow \ x+y=a-b \ \ &{ \ mbox{and}} \ x-y=a+b \ end{aligned}}} where "| a | = k" means the index a runs through the set of all subsets of size k of the set {1, 2, 3, 


}
 In these two identities an asymmetry appears that is not seen in the case of sums of finitely many terms: in each product, there are only finitely many sine factors and cofinitely many cosine factors
 If only finitely many of the terms Î¸i are nonzero, then only finitely many of the terms on the right side will be nonzero because sine factors will vanish, and in each term, all but finitely many of the cosine factors will be unity
 Let xi = tan, for i = 1,

 If x, y, and z are the three angles of any triangle, or in other words as tan either increases through positive values or decreases through negative values
 This is a one-point compactification of the real line
) Essentially this is Ptolemy's theorem adapted to the language of trigonometry
 For some purposes it is important to know that any linear combination of sine waves of the same period but different phase shifts is also a sine wave with the same period, but a different phase shift
 In the case of a linear combination of a sine and cosine wave, we have where More generally, for an arbitrary phase shift, we have where and Sum of sines and cosines with arguments in arithmetic progression: For any a and b: where arctan is the generalization of arctan which covers the entire circular range
 The above identity is sometimes convenient to know when thinking about the Gudermanian function
 If x, y, and z are the three angles of any triangle, ie if x + y + z = Ï, then where i2 = â1
 Template: split-sectionoccasionally one sees the notation i
e
 "cis" abbreviates "cos& +& i& sin"
 Though at first glance this notation is redundant, being equivalent to eix, its use is rooted in several advantages
 This notation was more common in the post WWII era when typewriters were used to convey mathematical expressions
superscripts are both offset vertically and smaller than 'cis' or 'exp'; hence, they can be problematic even for hand writing
 For example e ix2 versus cis versus exp
 For many readers, cis is the clearest, easiest to read of the three
 The cis notation is sometimes used to emphasize one method of viewing and dealing with a problem over another
 The mathematics of trigonometry and exponentials are related but not exactly the same; exponential notation emphasizes the whole, whereas cis and cos & + & i & sin notations emphasize the parts
 This can be rhetorically useful to mathematicians and engineers when discussing this function, and further serve as a mnemonic
 The cis notation is convenient for math students whose knowledge of trigonometry and complex numbers permit this notation, but whose conceptual understanding doesn't yet permit the notation e ix
 As students learn concepts that build on prior knowledge, it is important not to force them into levels of math they are not yet prepared for
 In some contexts, the cis notation may serve the pedagogical purpose of emphasizing that one has not yet proved that this is an exponential function
 In doing trigonometry without complex numbers, one may prove the two identities Similarly in treating multiplication of complex numbers, one may observe that the real and imaginary parts of the product of c1& +& is1 and c2& +& is2 are respectively Thus one sees this same pattern arising in two disparate contexts: This coincidence can serve as a motivation for conjoining the two contexts and thereby discovering the trigonometric identity and observing that this identity for cis of a sum is simpler than the identities for sin and cos of a sum
 Having proved this identity, one can challenge the students to recall which familiar sort of function satisfies this same functional equation The answer is exponential functions
 That suggests that cis may be an exponential function Then the question is: what is the base b? The definition of cis and the local behavior of sin and cos near zero suggest that 
 Thus the rate of change at 0 is i, so the base should be ei
 Thus if this is an exponential function, then it must be For applications to special functions, the following infinite product formulÃ¦ for trigonometric functions are useful: The Gudermannian function relates the circular and hyperbolic trigonometric functions without resorting to complex numbers; see that article for details
 The curious identity is a special case of an identity that contains one variable: a similar-looking identity is and in addition The following is perhaps not as readily generalized to an identity containing variables: Degree measure ceases to be more felicitous than radian measure when we consider this identity with 21 in the denominators: The factors 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10 may start to make the pattern clear: they are those integers less than 21 / 2 that are relatively prime to 21
 The last several examples are corollaries of a basic fact about the irreducible cyclotomic polynomials: the cosines are the real parts of the zeroes of those polynomials; the sum of the zeroes is the MÃ¶bius function evaluated at 21; only half of the zeroes are present above
 The two identities preceding this last one arise in the same fashion with 21 replaced by 10 and 15, respectively
 An efficient way to compute Ï is based on the following identity without variables, due to Machin: or, alternatively, by using Euler's formula: With the golden ratio Ï: Also see exact trigonometric constants
 In calculus the relations stated below require angles to be measured in radians; the relations would become more complicated if angles were measured in another unit such as degrees
 If the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of geometry, their derivatives can be found by verifying two limits
 The first is: verified using the unit circle and squeeze theorem
 It may be tempting to propose to use l'hÃ´pital's rule to establish this limit
 However, if one uses this limit in order to prove that the derivative of the sine is the cosine, and then uses the fact that the derivative of the sine is the cosine in applying l'hÃ´pital's rule, one is reasoning circularly â a logical fallacy 
 The second limit is: verified using the identity tan = ) / sin
 Having established these two limits, one can use the limit definition of the derivative and the addition theorems to show that sinâ² = cos and cosâ² = âsin
 If the sine and cosine functions are defined by their Taylor series, then the derivatives can be found by differentiating the power series term-by-term
 The rest of the trigonometric functions can be differentiated using the above identities and the rules of derivative: The integral identities can be found in "list of integrals of trigonometric functions"
 The fact that the differentiation of trigonometric functions results in linear combinations of the same two functions is of fundamental importance to many fields of mathematics, including differential equations and fourier transformations
 The Dirichlet kernel Dn is the function occurring on both sides of the next identity: The convolution of any integrable function of period 2Ï with the Dirichlet kernel coincides with the function's nth-degree Fourier approximation
 The same holds for any measure or generalized function
 yadi ham Keep it, jahaan eix or cis ek hi cheez hai
 The above formulas are useful in integrating the rational functions of sin and cos into the calculus

 abhigyaan shaakuntalam mahakavi kalidas kaa vishwavikhyath naatak he jiskaa anuwaad praaia: sabhi videshi bhashaaon main ho chukaa he
 It has a beautiful story of love, marriage, marriage, reprisal and reunion of King Dushyant and Shakuntala
 puranic katha main dushyant ko akashwani dwaara bodh hota he par is naatak main kavi ne mudrika dwaara iskaa bodh karaayaa he
 Its theatricality, its beautiful narratives, its poetic-aesthetic analogies, and the periodic notes used from place to place; And above all, the acoustics of the diverse episodes are so amazing that even Sanskrit dramas cannot compete with Abhigyan Shakuntal when viewed from these points of view; Then what to say about other languages! So this is the best thing here
 kalidas ne abhigyaan shaakuntal kii kathavstu moulik nahin chuni
 This story is derived from the Adiparva of the Mahaharata
 yon padmapurana main bhi shakuntla kii katha milti he or vah mahabharat kii apeksha shakuntala kii katha ke adhik nikat he
 For this reason, Winternitz has assumed that the story of Shakuntala is derived from Padmapurana
 parantu vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki padmapurana kaa yah bhaag shakuntala kii rachana ke baad likhaa or baad main prakshipt prathit hota he
 The curse of Durvasa is not mentioned in the Mahabharata story
 mahabharat kaa dushyant se yadi thik ulataa nahin, to bhi bahut adhik bhinn he
 Shakuntala of Mahabharata is not as well-groomed as that of Kalidasa
 vah dushyant ko vishwamitra or menka ke sambandh ke falswarup hue apane janm kii katha apane munh se hi sunaati he
 In the Mahabharata, Dushyant, enchanted by the appearance of Shakuntala, prays Gandharva marriage to Shakuntala; On which Shakuntala says that i can marry on the condition that the throne be given to my son only
 dushyant us samay to sweekaar kar letaa he or baad main apni rajdhani main lautakar jaan-boojhkar lajjawash shakuntala ko grahan nahin karata
 Kalidasa has refined the narrative thus received in unsophisticated form to his imagination
 durvasa ke shaap kii kalpana karke unhone dushyant ke charitra ko ooncha uthaaya he
 Shakuntala of Kalidasa is also an idol of nobility, beauty and compassion
 iske atirikt kalidas ne sari katha kaa nirvaah, bhaavon kaa chithran ityadi jis dhang se kiya he, vah moulik or apurv he
 Shakuntala was the wife of King Dushyant who was the mother of India's well-known king Bharata and the daughter of Maneka Apsara
 mahabharat main likhaa he ki shankutala kaa janm menka apsara ke garbh se hua tha jo ise van main chhodkar chali gai thi
 It was named Shakuntala by the Shankutas etc
 in the forest which protected it from predatory animals
 van main se ise kanv rishi uthaa laae the or apane ashram main rakhkar kanya ke samaan paalate the
 Once King Dushyant went out to hunt with some soldiers with him and roamed the ashram of Kanva Rishi
 rishi us samay vahaan upasthit nahin the; isse yuvati shakuntla ne hi raja dushyant kaa aatithy satkar kiya
 On the same occasion, the two married Prem and then Gandharva
 kuch dinon baad raja dushyant vahaan se apane rajya ko chale gaye
 When Kanva Muni came back, he was very happy to know that Shakuntala was married to Dushyant
 shakuntla us samay garbhvatee ho chuki thi
 With time, a very powerful and bright son was born from her womb, named 'bharata'
 kehete hai, 'bharat' naam 'bharat' ke naam par hi padaa
 a few days later Shakuntala took her son to Dushyant's court
 parantu shakuntla ko bich main durvasa rishi kaa shaap mil chukaa tha
 The king did not recognize it at all and said clearly that neither i know you nor can you give me shelter here
 parantu isi avasar par ek akashwani hui, jisase raja ko vidit hua ki yah meri hi patni he or yah putr bhi meraa hi he
 He remembered all the things about Kanva Muni's ashram and kept Shakuntala as his head queen
 âabhigyaan shaakuntalamâ main anek maarmik prasangon ko ullekh kiya gaya he
 One, when Dushyant and Shakuntala meet for the first time
 doosraa us samay, jab kanv shakuntala ko apane ashram se patigrih ke liye vidaa karte hai
 At that time, the sage himself says that if a sage like me has this fascination in his parents, then what will be the situation of those whose daughters are leaving for the house
 teesraa prasang he, shakuntala kaa dushyant kii sabha main upasthit hona or dushyant ko usko pahchaanane se inkaar karnaa
 The fourth episode is of the time when a ring with the name of Dushyant received by the fisherman is shown to him
 or paanchvaan prasang marichi maharishi ke ashram main dushyant-shakuntala ke milan kaa
 The greatest miracle of Kalidasa in Shakuntala is in his phonetic signs
 isamen kavi ko vilakshan safalataa yah mili he ki usne kahin bhi koi bhi vastu nishprayojan nahin kahi
 No character, any narrative statement, any incident, no natural scene is useless
 sabhi ghatnaayen yah drishy aage aane vaali ghatnaon kaa sanket chamatkaarik reeti se pehle hi de dete hai
 In the beginning of the play, while narrating the summer, the story of the drama was broadly communicated by feeling fragrant, falling asleep and lying in the shadows and being delightful at the end of the day, with the fragrance of the forest floor
 Has gone, indicating the meeting of Shakuntala and Dushyant respectively, then forgetting Shakuntala with sleep-effects and ending the play with pleasure
 isi prakaar naatak ke praarambhik geet main bhramaron dwaara shiris ke phulon ko zaraa-zaraa-sa chuumane se yah sanket miltaa he ki dushyant or shakuntala kaa milan alpasthayee hoga
 Some ascetics stop coming when the king is running after the stag with an arrow on the bow
 kehete hai-âmaharajâ yah ashram kaa harin he, is par tir na chalaanaa
 'in addition to the stag here, there is also a hint towards Shakuntala, who is naive and helpless like the stag
 âkahaan to harinon kaa atyant chanchal jivan or kahaan tumhaare vajra ke samaan kathor baan !â isse bhi shakuntala kii asahaayta or saralata tathaa raja kii nishthurataa kaa marmasparshi sanket kiya gaya he
 When Dushyanta and Shakuntala's love starts to grow a bit more, then the cry from the back is heard saying, "tapaswiyo, get ready to protect the creatures of the ashram
" shikari raja dushyant yahaan aayaa hua he
 'there also appears to have been a hint of the defense of Shakuntala from Dushyant's hands, but this signal was not heard in anyone's ear; Nobody saved Shakuntala
 isse sthiti kii karunajanakta or bhi adhik bad jaati he
 In the early part of the fourth issue, the disciple of Kanva while describing Prabhat mentioned the constant association of happiness and sorrow and unbearable grief of women in the separation of the beloved, before Dushyanta abandoned Shakuntala
 Makes the background-c from itself
 paanchaven ank main rani hansapadika ek geet gaati hai, jisamen raja ko unki madhur-vritti ke liye ulaahna diya gaya he
 Dushyanta also confesses that he has loved Hanspadika only once
 isse kavi yah gambheer sanket detaa he ki bhale hi shakuntala ko dushyant ne durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran bhuulakar choda, parantu ek baar pyaar karne ke baad raniyon kii upeksha karnaa unke liye koi nai baat nahin thi
 Other queens were also victims of this sweet attitude
 hansapadika ke is geet kii prishthbhumi main shakuntala ke parityag kii ghatana or bhi krur or kathor jaan padati he
 By similar phonetic gestures, Kalidasa has set a pleasant backdrop for Dushyant, Shakuntala and his son in the seventh issue
 indra raja dushyant ko apurv sammaan pradaan karte hai
 After that, upon reaching Hemkut mountain, Prajapati's ashram, the king starts feeling as if he is bathing in the lake of nectar
 is prakaar ke sanketon ke baad dushyant or shakuntala kaa milan or bhi adhik manohar ho uthta he
 German poet Goethe had said about Abhigyan Shakuntalam- isi prakaar sanskrit ke vidwaanon main yah shloke prasiddh he- This means - Among all the forms of poetry, drama is particularly beautiful
 naatakon main bhi kavy-soundarya kii drushti se abhigyaan shaakuntalan kaa naam sabase upar he
 Abhigyan Shakuntalam's name is at the top
 abhigyaan shaakuntalan main bhi uskaa chaturth ank or is ank main bhi chauthaa shloke to bahut hi romantic he
 In Abhigyan Shakuntal, there is a considerable amount of poetry as well as a portion of poetry
 isamen shringaar mukhya ras he; or uske sanyog tathaa viyog donon hi pakshon kaa paripaak sundar rup main hua he
 Apart from this, there is good expression of humor, valor and Karun Ras
 sthaan-sthaan par sundar or manoharini utprekshaayen na keval pathak ko chamatkrit kar detii hai, kintu abhisht bhav kii tivrata ko badhaane main hi sahaayak hoti hai
 In all the plays, Kalidas did not use his similes and motivations for mere ornamentation
 prayek sthaan par unki upama yaa utpreksha arth kii abhivyakti ko raspurn banane main sahaayak hui he
 Kalidas is famous in Sanskrit literature for his similes
 shaakuntal main bhi unki upyukt upama chunane kii shakti bhalee-bhaanti prakat hui
 In one place about Shakuntala, King Dushyant says that 'it is a flower that no one has smelled; Such is the Navapallava, which does not scratch anyone's fingernails; There is a gem, which is not pierced and there is a honey, which no one has tasted
 â in upamaaon ke dwaara shakuntala ke saundarya kii ek anokhi jhalak hamaari ankhon ke saamne aa jaati he
 Similarly, in the fifth issue Dushyanta abandons Shakuntala, saying, "O Tapaswini, do you want to tarnish your clan and impure me, like a river that breaks the coast and falls down the tree of the shore and It also taps its water
 â yahaan shakuntala kii chat ko todakar bahane vaali nadi se di gai upama raja ke manobhaav ko vyakt karne main vishesh rup se sahaayak hoti he
 Similarly, when Kanva's disciples take Shakuntala and reach Dushyant, Dushyant's vision falls on the Shakuntala among those ascetics
 vahaan shakuntala ke saundarya kaa vistrut varnan na karke kavi ne unke mukh se keval itnaa kahalava diya he ki âin tapasviyon ke bich main vah ghunghat vaali sundari koun he, jo pile patton ke bich main nai konpal ke samaan dikhaai pad rahi he
 'this small upma has depicted the beauty of Shakuntala by the goodness of the yellow leaves and the buds
 isi prakaar sarvadman ko dekhakar dushyant kehete hai ki âyah pratapi balak us agni ke sphuling kii bhaanti prathit hota he, jo dadhakati aag banane ke liye idhan kii raah dekhtaa he
 With this upma, Kalidas not only revealed the brilliance of the child, but has also clearly conveyed that this child will grow up to become the glorious Chakravarti emperor
 is prakaar kii manohar upamaaon ke anek udhaaharan shaakuntal main se diye ja sakate hai kyonki shaakuntal main 180 upamaayen prayukt huin hai
 And all of them surpass one by one
 yah thik he upama ke chunaav main kalidas ko vishesh kushalta praapt thi or yah bhi thik he ki unki-si sundar upmaayen anya kaviyon kii rachanaaon main durlabh hai, phir bhi kalidas kii sabase badi visheshta upama-kaushal nahin he
 Upma-kaushal is a common part of his poetry skills
 apane manobhaav ko vyakt karne athwa kisi ras kaa paripaak karne athwa kisi bhav kii teevr anubhuti ko jagaane kii kalidas anek vidhiyaan jaanate hai
 Kalidas has made his style particularly delightful by using a contextual selection of words, choosing the appropriate verses of the desired sense and using euphemism
 jahaan kalidas shakuntala ke soundarya-varnan par utre hai, vahaan unhone keval upamaaon or utprekshaon dwaara shakuntala kaa rup chithran karke hi santosh nahin kar liya he
 At first, he merely said that 'if there is so much form among the residents of Tapovan, then understand that the forest vines beat the vines of the garden
 â phir dushyant ke mukh se unhone kahalwaya ki âitani sundar kanya ko ashram ke niyam-paalan main lagaana aisa hi he jaise nil camel kii pankhuri se babul kaa ped kaatna
 'after that, Kalidas says that' Shakuntala's form is so beautiful that even though she is wearing a thick vulcanic cloth, then her beauty is not reduced to anything, but it has increased
 kyonki sundar vyakti ko jo bhi kuch pahana diya jaae vahi uskaa aabhushan ho jaataa he
 'he then compares Sukumar's body of King Shakuntala with the green flower-laden Lata, so that the image of that unique beauty is painted in front of the reader's eyes
 iske baad us saundarya kii anubhuti ko charam seemaa par pahunchane ke liye kalidas ek bhramar ko le aae hai; jo shakuntala ke mukh ko ek sundar khilaa hua phool samajhakar uskaa rasapan karne ke liye uske upar mandaraane lagata he
 Thus, Kalidasa did not take the support of the antlers to portray the beauty of Shakuntala as much as the euphemism; And this cuisine is considered to be the life of poetry
