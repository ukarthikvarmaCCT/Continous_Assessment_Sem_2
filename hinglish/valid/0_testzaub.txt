 Alif lam mim Allah is the one who has no qualifying status except the same person who is the caretaker of the whole world, he has given you the book of the Nazil, who praises those who are in front of him, and he has given the advice to the people before him
 And of the book of Nazil, the book of Nazil, and of the Nazis, of course, those who do not believe in the verses of God, they are strong, and God is strong
 Ghalib is the avenger on everything, of course, there is no cloth on God, neither in the sky nor in the sky is he the one who wants your face in the mother's stomach, but he has no love except Ghalib and Dana
 The person who wrote the book on you, the hawks in it, are delightful, the same is the original book, and some of the people who are strong in their hearts are following those verses
 Who are the Mutshabeh so that they can destroy the verdict and think that they fit the meaning However, no one knows the real meaning except God and those who are greater than those who are ill
 Those people say that we believe in them all from the side of our God, and the only ones who understand are our parents
 After instructing the heart, do not dowdle, and with your barrage, there is no doubt in us that you are going to give me a great blessing
 i will not gather people well, of course, God does not go against his promise
 Of course, those who have cheated will not save anything from themselves, nor will their goods, Neither their children nor these people will be the victims of the world, and they are the condition of the people before them and if they denied our verses, then God took them in the punishment of their sins and God is going to punish them severely
 People asked for a quarrel and tell them that very soon you will be a Maghulab (loser) and will be gathered in the world and that is a bad destination
 Of course for you those two one There is a huge sign that another gang used to be jehad in the path of God and the other is seeing the infidels of the Muslims who are doubling their eyes and whoever wants to help themselves with their help, of course for the eyebrows There is a great sense in the world that people in the world have their wonderful things wives and sons and large lots of gold and silver and great horses and cattle and farming
 Has been shown to be well done with all these benefits of world life and Good place is definitely here, tell those people that should i tell you better than all those people who have abstained for them, there are gardens of their family here under their canals which will always remain in it and Apart from that, there are clean and cleanliness for them and they are very happy and God is looking very closely to those who pray that our cradles We have brought the honor, you also spared our sins and saved us from the wonders of patience, those who speak the truth, and are God-fearing and spenders, and those who believe in the previous nights have testified by the Gods and angels and ilms
 Is that he is no stranger to anyone except him, and he is going to take care of himself with adul and justice, except that there is no sweet man and he is poor So there is almost certainly Islam near God and Ahle Kitab, who has denied that right If we have just come to know the real mischief and real and the person who denied the signs of God is going to take account very soon, if these people respect you, then tell me that i have finished my whole life in front of God And i am also my friend) and you ask me if you have brought Islam, if you have brought Islam, then you have gone out of your way and if you turn around So it is duty to just deliver the message to you and look at God
 Of course, those who deny the verses of God and kill the unworthy prophets and kill those who claim to do justice, then you those people Give the good news of painful wonders, these are the people who have done all the world and in the end have failed and no one helps them
 Not to those who were given a part of the book They are called so that they decide their quarrel, but even then a gang of them takes a turn and this is what people are going to do because they say that we have to count a few days Except if the fire of the soul will not touch, the people who have been doing the same thing, iftera, they have cheated them in their humility, then what will happen to them when we see them one day No one will gather and every person will be given a complete revenge for what he did and he will not be taken away in any way, you demand that the master of all the Gods, whoever you want, Sultanate and whomever can take away the Sultanate and You are the one whom you respect and whoever you want, you have all kinds of goodness in your hands
 Of course you are the master of everything, you enter the night into the night
 Is strengthened and thou Dakihl night the day thou living lifeless And you make a lifeless life out of life and you give it to those who want it
 Mominin, except Mominin, do not make the Kafirs your guardian, and who will do so does nothing to do with God, but somehow If you want to escape and God scares you by yourself and you have to go back to God, you should tell them that whatever is in your heart, hide it or Tell me that God knows him and everything that is in anticipation and everything he knows in the ground and God is on everything that day, every person will be able to present what he has said and what he has done evil
 i wish i would have been put to shame in his bed and in the middle of it and God scares you with his own self and God is very sure of his closes and tell those people that if you keep yourself friends Area so do i advocate that God will keep you friends and you you The crime will be spared and God is a great splendor
 Say that God is God and Rasul, then if this people respect him then God does not keep the Kafirs as a friend
 i have heard the hawk's hawk with a hawk and knows it better when Imran's wife has requested that the children in my stomach who are my cradles He is free to look at you
 When you have given birth to my daughter again, then i started saying, i am a girl in my family and this girl does not belong to the girl, however what was the need to say that she was born to him
 It was very clear and i have named her Maryam and i give her and her child to Satan Maraud in your shelter, then her family gave Mary a happy ending and her Mr
 Nsho and Numa {upbringing} were well and made Zakaria his convoy at some point If Zakariya went to visit him in prayer, he would have asked for something to be present with Maryam, and asked if Mary had come to you from where he was, then Mary used to say that this is from God, of course God is the one who wants to be At the same time, Zakaria prayed with her family and i am the one who cares for my prayers, i am sure you are going to listen to my blessings
 Mr
 Zacharias was praying in Huzre that the angels gave him a voice that God gives you the good news of Yehia, who will testify to Kalematullah and will be a ruler and will not be able to respect women, and Neko will be a prophet
 How can i be a boy, although my old age has arrived and my wife is impatient, Farmeya is the same God who wants to earn money
 There is a sign for my family, Irshad is a symbol for you o Mary, God has displeased you and kept you clean from the sins and evils, and has made you free from all the women of the world, o Mary, i thank you for putting up with my family and keep on talking with my friends It is from the news of the gab that we send to you through 'he', you were not present with those guardian Mary when those people Neither Kalam was putting in the river as a curia, who becomes Mary's convoy, nor were you present with them when those people were quarreling with each other when the angels told you, Mary God is born to you only by the command of a boy Gives the good news of being called Jesus Christ Ibne Maryam in the world and in the end, will be in the confines of religion and God, and when it is in the swing and is old
 Say you will will talk to people and Neco cars were Lord i How will the boy be, although i have not been touched by any man, similarly God wants to do whatever he wants to do when he decides to do something, then he just says 'ho' then he is done and God is the book
 i will teach you the wisdom and wisdom and the Scriptures, and i became the Messenger of Israel, i have brought to you from the side of my God the sign that i am the face of a vindication from the clay
 Now if i can do that, then he will fly by God himself and i will do my own thing madardzad {padayashi} to do good to the leper and life of the dead and whatever you eat and accumulate in your homes
 i will tell you if you are honest, then of course there is a big sign in these things for you and i respect the fact that Taurat is present in front of me
 i hate you, make the hawk out of them and i will be your God i have come to you by taking a sign from the side, i am afraid of God and i pray you, of course God is my and your God, i pray that this is the direct way of birth
 Then when Jesus saw His cat, he started saying who is that God On the other hand, the Hawaris said to be my helpers, "we are self-reliant and we believe in God and you should bear witness that we are God-fearing, and we have received a prayer in God's barrage
" That we believe in what you have raised, and you believe in the advocacy of your Rasul, you write us in the office of the witnesses, and the Jews craved and God himself confessed his burial and God is better than all i am going to do this when God has said to God, i will definitely fulfill the life of your life and will take you on my side and i will give you pakiza and pakiza Uॅga and those who prevailed over the infidels to them your lobbying Judgment Rkuॅga Then you all have to come back to me and then you will decide between the things you used to quarrel with, the people who have taken care of me, they will do a lot of hard work on them and they will have no help and those who confessed their faith and If you do good deeds, God will give them their full blessings and blessings, and God does not keep friends with those who are telling you before you He is a man full of God and signs of God, close to God, like the condition of Jesus, the condition of Adam that he was made an effigy of the soil and said that "be done", he has got the right thing from your perspective
 Do not become one of those who doubt you, even after you have met your ilm, if anyone asks you to respect Jesus, then say that we should call our sons, you will call your sons and we You call your women and you your prayers and we call our lives and you Let us all confess after that and curse God for lies, these are true facts and no one except God, and of course God himself is gullible and disastrous, then if i turn away even then i care The fellow knows a lot of people, you should say that i have come to such a book that you and i mean that you should not pray to anyone except God and some qi Do not make him a person and apart from God, none of us should change your face, even if i am in a mess then you are a witness, i am a lord, why do you quarrel about Ibrahim that someone calls him a Jew
 Although Touret and the Gospel were revealed after them, do you not understand that much? You are the same people that you had a quarrel with whom you had some illusion, then what is the quarrel that you are not aware of and God knows and You do not know that Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Nasrani but was of absolute right and was a patriarchal and was not even more than a Mushriq, more special than Ibrahim was the people who specially advocated him and that Prophet and Believers are there and Mominin God is a master, i have a gang from the book, i have tried to mislead you in some way, even though they mislead themselves and do not understand it
 Why do you deny the verses of God? Although you can be a witness yourself, why do you mess up the right and wrong and hide the rights, although you know, and a gang from the book of Ehle said that believe the book that has been revealed to Muslims early in the morning and finally Refuse the time, maybe the Muslim may go back and take care of your poor, do not accept anything other than that, you say that just instruct yourselves
 It is also the case that is not given to you, Give it to someone else or someone to quarrel with you here and say that the Fazal is in the hands of God, whoever he wants and God is very proud, he knows whoever he wants for his own good and God is great
 Fazal karam wala hai and ehle book is such that even if you keep a pile of money with them, you will give it to you in the same way and the hawk is such that if even an Asharfi Keep in mind, unless you stand at par and will not give you back, it is because of this that it is their belief that there is no way of accusation on us in Jhilo and knowingly add lies to God
 If you fulfill your intention and abstain from abstinence, then of course God keeps the friends of the abstainers
 Of course in the end for those people who get a little compensation for themselves and their own g will be part of and the Day of Judgment Allah speak to them and not to their Will not look at them and will not cook them and pain for them is amazing and the hawks from the book are such that they read their tongue in the book, so that you understand that it is a book though it is not a book And it says that it is from God here, although he is not from God here and deliberately adds lies to God
 No man had the zeba that God would give him the book and Hikam So and prophesied ata and he told people to leave God and become my captive, rather you become one of Allah because you continue to teach books to God and you have always been studying yourself and he will not tell you that Make angels and prophets to be good, but after you become a Muslim, you will be ordered by God, when God has confessed to prophets that we should give you whatever book And after giving your consent, some Rasool will come to you and the book you have with himhowever, those who are in the hope and those who are in the ground, have put their necks in front of them with happiness or force and will return to them, say that we believe in God and the book which was revealed to us and which Ibrahim and Ismail and Isaac and Jacob and Aulade were castigated on Jacob and Moses and Jesus and the other prophets who were favored by their family, we would be in one of them
 We do not care and we are the solemnist of it and if a person who desires any other deity except Islam will not be accepted by him, and he will be in a strong deficit in the end, how will God instruct such people who After bringing, he again confessed, although he had confessed that the Prophet was a raven and he had come to make appearances and illuminations and God himself could do such fanaticism Does not instruct the people, the punishment of such people is that God and The angels and all the people are fit and they will always remain in the same fit, neither will they be taken care of nor will they be granted, but the people who have lived after this and have done their Islam, however, will be a very great kindness Those who have become infidels after their faith and then continue to increase the Kufr, they will not be accepted at all, and these people are misguided, of course, those who have left the Kufh Were prepared and died in the condition of kufha, then even if so much gold is given to someone's gulli to get rid of the land, then even if the land is full, it will certainly not be sacrificed
 These are the people for whom there will be painful wonders and none of their helpers
 As long as you do not spend some of your favorite things on your own, you cannot afford justice at the door of goodness and you can spend any other thing for yourself
 Surely, Yakub, who is the ruler of Taurait's soul, knows all the things Had done all the food for Israel except for them, say that if you read it and then even after that whoever adds lies to God, then these people are the victims, tell them that God has given the truth, then now you get Ibrahim Advocate that the house that was built from the null to the strand and not from the muskarin, the house that was first built for the people, it is surely the man who is in the maize and the leader of all the ships
 There are many vajas and bright signs in it, there is Ibrahim and who entered this house came in peace and the people are justified to do Hajj for the sake of God who has the intention of reaching there and whoever has done it in the nature of Hajj Denied that God is unfaithful to all the ships, tell me why do you go away from the book of God, but the work that you do is done to God Could complete Ittila you say the road to let AI Ehle book Dida Danista God Why do you stop those who believe in the faith of God and do not be unaware of what you do? If those of you believe that i have even said any fir of the book, then after believing you, you will leave you again as a Kafir and How will you become a Kafir, although the verses of God are read in front of you, and its apostles are also there in you and the person who is related to God is definitely straight The fear that has been imposed on this man is to be afraid of God as much as he is right to be afraid of you and you should not die on anything other than Islam, and all of you hold on to the cord of your own strength and do not break each other and your Remember the favor of God, but when you were enemies among yourselves, God created mischief in your heart, then you became a brother to each other due to his failure, and you lost fire
 Areas like were on the club fall that God was God, then saved you from the Ehkam makes a statement by making use of it so that you can get on the road and there should be a gang like you who will call for righteousness and give orders of good work and stop doing bad things and such people will get their heartfelt wishes and you will get those It is not like that which is happening between each other and even after the light comes, it is not a tongue to mouth and it is a great miracle for such people, on the day some people face white There will be queens and some faces will be in the face of those who are in their mouths, why did you become infuriated after bringing Imaan? Well, taste the punishment in the punishment of your kufu and those who will show no shame, they will be in the mercy of God
 These are the verses of God that we always read to you properly and God does not want to oppress the people of all the ships and whatever is in the hope and whatever Neither is in Allah and Rujhu all actions towards Allah you Are there good gangs that have been created to instruct you, you command good work and stop from bad things and believe in God and if i believe even the book, then it would have been very good for them
 They are sincere and often repugnant
 These people cannot reach you except for a minor ajith and if they fight you, they will have to return towards you and then their Help will not come from him and wherever he goes, he is killed by Roussewai, but through the ehad of God and the ehad of the people and then in the grief of God of manipulation and he is killed by Mohtaji, because of that He used to deny the verses of the Prophet and murdered the prophets, this is his punishment that he disobeyed and went to great lengths and these people too are not sure of everyone from this book
 Uc people are read verses such proven steps that night to God They do it and decorate it equally; God and fast believe in the end, and they command good work and stop them from bad works and run in righteous works, and these people are from noble men and all that Doing good will not be condemned, and God is very well aware of the abstinence
 Of course, those who have taken care of themselves to save themselves from God, nothing can be done for them
 Neither their children nor these people are souls and will always live in them
 The amount of money that these people spend in their lives is an example of blindness in which there is a lot of frost and they go to the fields of those who have lost their lives Sitam has been demolished and then brought up by killing him and God did nothing at all for him, but he did the crime on himself
 Lao These Gahr people fall as they do not keep picking up some of your waste You will be happy that enmity is dripping from their mouths and what is in their hearts is more than that
 We have clearly told you this thing if you understand that people are such that you are angry with them and they don't want you
 And you believe in the whole book and it is not like that when you meet, then you start saying that we too have faith and when we are alone, you get angry at you You tell them that you die in your anger, the things that are in your heart, of course, you definitely know that if you touch the good, then you feel bad and when you face any problem, then you are happy and If you are patient and refuse your abstinence, nothing will ever get you away, but God dominates their operations and there was a time when you would Standing out in the wee hours of the children and seizing Mominin on the fronts of battle Were and God knows everything and hears this is the story of the time when two of you gangs decided to kiss and then because God was their patron and Mominin should have faith in God himself
 You helped me, you were completely unaware that God gave you Fateh, you are afraid of God so that you can be thankful, at that time you were saying to Mominin whether for you It is not enough that your family will help you by sending three thousand angels from the sky, but if you keep up the steps and escape and the iceberg will come on you, then your family will help you with five thousand angels who will be killed by the war and God has given this help only for your happiness and so that it gives you a feeling of heart and help when God is there Mr
 toward giving that is Mighty, the Wise so that reduce a gang of infidels Or make such a promise that if the Namurad go back to his house with a mouth, there is nothing in it, whether God himself accepts his punishment or punishes him because he is a victim, and whatever is in the hope and whatever is in the land is all the better
 It is anyone who is spared and punished by whomever and God is a great splendor, so that the believers do not go away eating Sudan, and be afraid of God to get rid of you
 And be afraid of the fire of the world which is prepared for the infidels, and take care of God and the Messenger, so that you may have mercy and run towards the blessings and paradise of your family, which is equal to the sky and the land, and that of the dieters
 Prayers have been made for those who spend in happy and difficult times and stop anger and pass on to people and those who do good will to Allah Ht keeps people sit there wantonness by chance or you Juhlm over If you remember God and apologize for your sins and who else is spared of crimes except God and who do what they do, they do not deliberately move away from them
 Such people are punished by their family
 And there are gardens under which the canals continue that they will always be in them and there is a good wage of the people who have gone through many incidents before you
 Take a walk on the screen and see what happened to the jilters, this is just a statement for the common people, but instruction and advice for the dieters and Muslims do not curse, and do not whistle, if you are a true mother
 Ghalib and groom will be injured, if you have been injured, in the same way, your fate has also been injured, these are the days of coincidence which we alternated between us
 And turn it so that God sees the true believers separately from the Muslims and Do not take advantage of the martyrdom of the hawk, and do not keep friends with the savior, and that separates the true believers from all odds and make the disgraceful, do you understand that all of them will go into exile and Has God not even recognized those of you who have done jihad and did not recognize only those who have proved to be willing to die before death comes? You used to just now see him with your eyes and you are still looking at him and Mohammad is just Rasul, before that many prophets have passed, then if Mohammad dies from his death or is killed, you will reverse the reverse
 And if the opposite turns, then nothing will spoil God and will give good recompense to those who thank God, and no one can die if God rules them
 Minister may not have received written every one death Vkhte Muayyan and changed person In the world, if we want to give it out of it and the person who wants the revenge of the end will give it out of it and we will soon give thanks to the people of Venus and many such prophets have gone through with whom many people of Allah jihad And then the trouble they faced in the way of God, neither did they lose courage nor curiosity, they started pleading and they proved to be better than those who proved themselves And i am sure that he had nothing to do except to ask for blessings that our cradle will forgive our crime and our actions, and prove us in the face of the enemies and give us a victory over the gang of infidels
 God has changed them in the world and in the end, good change has been made and God blesses those who do righteousness
 If you plead those people, they will turn you back in reverse and then you will come back in deficit
 You will go rather God is your guardian and he is better than all the helpers
 We will almost certainly deposit your Rob in the hearts of the infidels because those people have made it possible for God to share this idol which God has not ruled by any kind and his whereabouts are good
 And there is a bad place for the abusers
 Of course, God had made his promise come true when you were killing him with his command, even you Even after showing you the thing you like, you have brazenly, and you have quarreled with the rules, and some of you who dislike Rasul have bowed down from the world and some of the talis have finally turned you away from their side to make them yours
 It was acceptable to try it and God set you aside and God is going to do a big job on Mominin, remember the time when you ran on the mountain
 Took did God the campus Rasool also PIP will punish the PIP so that when Sometimes if something is going on with your hands or there is a problem, then you do not pledge and learn to be patient and God is aware of everything that you do, then after this pip, God praised you leisurely that one of you gang i fell asleep deeply and a gang who were still alive at that time started living with God in such a bad way and started saying such a good thing
 It is in love to say that God has the will of every soul, he is hiding such things in his heart that he does not reveal to you that if we had something to do in this age, we would not have been killed here and say that you are in your homes While living in it, the Jin whose destiny was written to die, he would come out of his place and come to his place of death and test it so that whatever is in your heart can test it and God Who knows the secret of hearts, of course, on the day when two gatherings got intertwined On the day of those people who ran away from you, because of their sinful crimes, Satan deceived them and overthrew their feet, and God certainly did to them
 Of course, God is a great sparring, so that the believers should not be like those who have become infidel brothers When they have gone out of their homes or have gone to Jihad, they say about them that if they lived with us, they would not die or die so that God would make their hearts smile
 And God only lives and kills and God is watching everything you do and if you die or die in the way of God, then surely God will save you better than the one you accumulate and if you Die or be killed, you will be raised towards God
 It is a favor to God that you met him softly and if you were bad-tempered and hard-hearted then these people would have been scattered around you
 You go through them and pray for them and pray for them
 If you decide to do some work on it, then trust yourself, if God has helped you, then no one can come to you and if God leaves you then who is there who will help you after that? Stand up and Mominin needs to have faith in God himself and there is no pride of a prophet that if he wants to and will take care of it, then the thing which is of interest is the same on the Day of Judgment
 Then every person will be able to get a complete revenge for what they have done and they will not be taken away in any way, who can be equal to the happiness of the person, who can be equal to the person who is arrested and who has a whereabouts
 And what a bad place he is
 Those people belong to the great harbors of God here, and all the things that they do, God himself is doing a great favor to the believers
 That sent a messenger to him that people respect those who read verses inscribed them Reads and recounts his health and teaches him the things of books and wisdom, if he was in a previously uncovered gummah, what Muslims, when you had a problem in which you had put a lot of trouble, then you said this You say that it is from you on your own, of course, everything is on your own and on the day the two hoardings got intertwined with you, the trouble you had Because of your mischief and so that God can see the true believers and see the profits and the profits were told that let's come to Jihad in the path of God or remove it, then if we knew to fight then these people would surely support you
 On that day, Banisbate was more close to the dog of faith than his mouth, he says things which are not in his heart and he knows the person whom he hides, who knows well In saying i wish our lobbying about Iyon that tell them die not If you are true, then avoid death on your own life, and those who were martyred in the path of God, do not consider them dead, but those people are alive and alive, they are able to get a living from their family and God has given the Fazal and Karam
 They have not been blown away by it and those who lag behind and do not join them celebrate the happiness that they will not be afraid of any kind and neither It will be for the sake of God himself that he is not happy after getting the good news of his self and his fear and the fact that God does not ruin the promise of Mominin, those who have said God and Rasool even after eating the wound The big reason for them is that when people come and start telling them that people have submitted for you, they fear their faith will become more And they say: Allah is sufficient for us and what is good Karasajh then it People came back with goddamn goodness and fuzzle and they did not even touch any evil and are proud of their godliness and they are going to do big fudge
 It was just Satan who only scares his friends
 If you are a real mom, be afraid of me and do not make people smile because of the people who are introduced to the kufa because these people cannot reach God for themselves
 He wants that his part in the end will not be accepted and there is a great miracle for him
 Of course, those who have bought some money for the sake of Imaan will not spoil anything for God and it is a painful surprise for them and those who have done it will not Do not think that what we have given to them is better in their favor, we have given mohallah and befree only for this reason so that they and good gun Do it and it is amazing for them to do it, God is not so bad Regardless of the condition you are on, leave the mother-in-law on the same condition and God is not there to tell you things about Gab, but God chooses whoever he wants in his apostles and believe in his principles and if If you believe and abstain, then you have to pay a lot of money and people who have given something to them from their own fury do not care about it That it will be better for them rather it is worse for their right because the person who is feared will be worn on their neck on the day of Judgment, and all the sky and land's inheritance is God and whatever you do is good
 Beware of those who say that God is a pauper and we are very rich God has heard this nonsense of those people, what they did to them and their prophets To kill you, we will write from now on and we will say good Taste the fun of those things that your hands have already sent, otherwise God is never going to persecute your people who say that God has promised us that unless some Rasul shows us that He sacrifices and licks him in the fire, till that time, we will not believe that you should tell me that many prophets tell me that you are welcome and light and what you You have brought a complaint, then if you are truthful then why did you kill if he also confuses you on this, then even before you many prophets have come up with light and right and Noorani book, yet people have finally given up their lives Everybody will enjoy the death and you will be able to get complete revenge on the Day of Doom, the person who has been removed from the world and reached the exodus
 By the world's life is nothing you goods but the plumbing of deception You will surely be tested and those people who have been given books before you, you will have to hear a lot of pain from the pain and sadness from them, and if you will suffer and continue to abstain, then of course it will be of great courage
 It is work and remind them of that time when God had taken a note of the book by saying that you should give a clear statement to the book and it is something Not guilty, but these people and they threw them back and got a little price in return
 What a bad thing these people are buying
 You should not even think of those who are being beaten on their caravan and did i don't want to be praised, i want you not to think that they are relieved of their wonders but they are painful for them, and the sky and the land itself There is a country and God himself is in possession of everything
 There is no doubt that the presumptions and There are many signs in the birth of the land and in the change of day and night for the foolish people, who rise and sit and talk about God, they think and worry about the contingent and the texture of the land and say that God has made it useless
 You did not do Pak and Pakiza, just save us from the wonders of our religion, our cage, whom you put in the pot, then surely put it to Russia and atrocities We have no help for the person, our listener, we heard a voiceman say that if we believe in our God, then i believe that our parents give us our sins and remove our evils from us and give us righteousness
 Take with you and give us whatever you have promised us through your Rasools, and do not make us go on the day of doom, you do not even promise against them
 Rvrdigar have Kuhbul pray and that we work with to work with you, You are not a man or a woman, because you are one another, people and cities who have been destroyed and they have taken the path of our path and they have fallen in the war and martyred, i will surely overcome their evils and will take them to the gardens of unconsciousness under which The canals are continuing here for God, this is the revenge of his actions, and for God itself, it is a good change
 Do not deceive you by letting the kafirs live in peace These few are rosa benefit, then their whereabouts are very good and what a bad place, but the people who have abstained from their family are the gardens under which the canals are released and they will always remain in it, they are here for their own sake

 With regard to the end of Kali Yuga and the beginning of Satyuga, there is a general belief that in 1989, the time of twelve years up to 2001 should be in the form of Samadhi
 isamen maanvi purusharthyukt vikaas or prakruti prerana se sampann hone vaali vinaash kii, donon prakriyaayein apane-apane dhang se har kshetra main sampann honi chahie
 The time of twelve years is also called practical era
 yug sandhikaal ko yadi itnaa maanakar chalaa jaay, to isamen koi atyayukti jaisi baat nahin hogi
 At the interval of every twelve years, a new change comes, whether it is man, tree, plant or world universe, this change is reflected
 manushya sharir kii praayah sabhi koshikaaye har baarah varsh main swayan ko badal detii he, atah sthool drushti ko isaki prathit nahin ho paati kintu he yah vigyaan-sammat
 The number of twelve has special significance in time calculation

 The precious uses of penance and atonement scourge also show the importance and uniqueness of the twelve-year period

 The astrologer Medhatithi must have thought that the Kali Yuga has already passed for me for several thousand years, then it cannot be 1200 years

 The meaning of this is that - 'at the end of four thousand divine years, that is, in four thousand divine years', then the golden age will come which will light up the minds and souls of human beings
 is shloke main divya shabd aayaa he
 Medhatithi gave its meaning to the deity and till now almost all the wise people have been doing the same meaning
 chunki ek maanushi varsh ke baraabar devataaon kaa ek din hota he, yah vichaar karke medhatithi ne bhram se 1200 varsho kaa kaliyug samajha or unhen dev varsh maanakar unke 360 se guna karke 432000 bana diya or kaliyug kii itani avadhi likh di jo sarvatha mithyaa he

 The divine word is formed by applying the suffix 'swartheyat' to the Divine metal

 Therefore, the divine is only called the Sun
 divi dyu ko kehete hai or dyu din kaa naam he
 The word deity is formed from other 'devatal' etc

 medhatithi ne chaaron yugon ko devataaon ke yug or unke varsho ko dev varsh likhaa he, jiskaa khandan kulluk bhatta 500 varsh pehle hi kar chuke hai
 In fact, the north south motion of the Sun is called the Divine Year, which has a 360 number speed, that is, 6 months of Uttarayan and 360 months of Dakshinayana took 360 days and nights
 isi ko divya varsh kehete hai
 Therefore, it is not the year of the divine deities
 isliye jo aage 360 se 1200 ko guna kar aaye hai vah guna na kiya, to kaliyug kii thik aayu 1200 varsho kii hi hui

 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj yaa shivaji raaje bhosle bharat ke raja evam ranneetikaar the jinhone 1674 main pashchim bharat main maratha samrajya kii neenv rakhi
 He fought the Mughal Empire of Aurangzeb for many years
 san 1674 main raigarh main unka rajbhishek hua or chhatrapati bane
 Shivaji provided a qualified and progressive administration with the help of his disciplined army and well organized administrative units
 unhone samar-vidya main anek navachaar kiye tathaa chhapamar yuddh kii nayi style viksit kii
 He revived ancient Hindu political practices and courtesy etiquette and replaced Marathi and Sanskrit with the language of royalty
 bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut se logon ne shivaji ke jeevancharit se prerana lekar bharat kii swatantrata ke liye apana tan, man dhan nyochhavar kar diya
 Today, on the lines of his politics, there is a political aspect called Shiv Sena in Nepal and India
 shivaji maharaj kaa janm 19 farvari 1630 main shivneri durg main hua tha
 Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630 in Shivneri fort with the womb of Jijabai, wife of Shahji Bhonsle
 shivneri kaa durg puna se uttar kii taraf junnar nagar ke paas tha
 His childhood was spent under the guidance of his mother Jijau Maa Saheb
 vah sabhi kalaon main maahir the, unhone bachapan main raajnneeti evam yuddh kii shiksha lee thi
 These belonged to the Bhonsle sub-caste who were originally from the Kshatriya Maratha caste
 gagabhatta ke anusaar shivaji kaa vansh mewar ke prasiddh guhil sisodiya vansh se miltaa he
 It is due to Shivaji that the entire Maratha community has got the status of being a Kshatriya
 unke pita apratim shoorveer the or unki duusari patni tukabai mohite thim
 His mother Jijabai Jadhav was an extraordinary genius born in the clan and his father was a powerful feudal
 shivaji maharaj ke charitra par mata-pita kaa bahut prabhaav padaa
 Right from childhood, he began to understand the atmosphere and events of that era
 shaasha varg kii karatuuton par ve jhallaate the or baichaiyn ho jate the
 The flame of freedom was ignited in his child's heart
 unhone kuch swamibhakt saathiyon kaa sanghathan kiya
 As the situation progressed, his resolve to break the shackles of foreign rule became stronger
 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa vivaah san 14 may 1640 main saibai nimbalkar ke saath laal mahal, puna main hua tha
 At that time the kingdom of Bijapur was going through a period of mutual struggle and foreign invasion
 aise samrajya ke sultan kii seva karne ke badale unhone maawalon ko bijapur ke kilaaf sangathit karne lage
 Maval Pradesh is connected to the Western Ghats and is some 150 km long and 30 km wide
 ve sangharmpurn jivan vyateet karne ke kaaran kushal yoddha maane jate hai
 Marathas and people of all castes live in this region
 shivaji maharaj in sabhi jati ke logon ko lekar maawalon naam dekar sabhi ko sangathit kiya or unase sampark kar unke pradesh se parichit ho gaye the
 He had started the construction of the fort by bringing Maval youths
 maawalon kaa sahyog shivaji maharaj ke liye baad main utana hi mahatvapurn sabit hua jitna shershah suri ke liye afagaanon kaa saath
 At that time Bijapur was troubled by mutual struggle and Mughal invasion
 bijapur ke sultan adilshaah ne bahut se durgon se apni sena hataakar unhen sthaneey shaskaon yaa samanton ke haath saunp diya tha
 When Adilshah fell ill, anarchy spread in Bijapur and Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of the opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 shivaji maharaj ne iske baad ke dinon main bijapur ke durgon par adhikaar karne kii niti apanaai
 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Shivaji sent his envoy to Sultan Adilshah and informed him that he was ready to pay better money than the first fortress and handed over this area to him
 unhone adilshaah ke darbariyon ko pehle hi rishwat dekar apane paksh main kar liya tha or apane darbariyon kii salaah ke mutabik adilshaah ne shivaji maharaj ko us durg kaa adhipati bana diya
 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset
 usne shahji raaje ko apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha
 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe
 usake baad aurangzeb ne mirzaraja jaisingh ko bhejkar 23 kilon par kabja kiya baad main shiji maharaj ke mawala tanaji malusre ne kondhana durg par kabja kiya par us yuddh main vah viragati ko praapt hua uski yaad main kondana par adhikaar karne ke baad uskaa naam singhgarh rakhaa gaya
 Shahaji Raje was given the title of Poona and Soupa and the fortress of Soupa was in the hands of his relative Baji Mohite
 shivaji maharaj ne raat ke samay soopa ke durg par akraman karke durg par adhikaar kar liya or baaji mohite ko shahji raaje ke paas karnataka bhej diya
 Some part of his army also came in the service of Shivaji Maharaj
 isi samay purandar ke kiledaar kii mrityu ho gai or kile ke uttaradhikaar ke liye uske teenon beton main ladaai chhid gai
 Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar on the invitation of two brothers and, taking recourse to diplomacy, he imprisoned all the brothers
 is tarah purandar ke kile par bhi unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed
 1647 isvi tak ve chaakan se lekar nira tak ke bhubhag ke bhi adhipati ban chuke the
 With his increased military power, Shivaji Maharaj planned to enter the plains
 ek ashwarohi sena kaa gathan kar shivaji maharaj ne aabaaji sonder ke netritv main konkan ke viruddh ek sena bheji
 Abaji captured nine other fortifications including Konkan
 iske alaava taala, mosmala or raiti ke durg bhi shivaji maharaj ke adheen aa gaye the
 All the property looted was kept safe in Raigad
 kalyaan ke governor ko mukt kar shivaji maharaj ne kolaba kii ore rukh kiya or yahan ke pramukhon ko videshiyon ke kilaaf yuddh ke liye uksaaya
 Sultan of Bijapur was already in a rage before Shivaji Maharaj's antics
 usne shivaji maharaj ke pita ko bandi banane kaa aadesh de diya
 Shahaji Raje was in Karnataka at the time and was taken prisoner by a treacherous assistant Baji Ghorpade and brought to Bijapur
 un par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone qutubashah kii seva praapt karne kii koshish kii thi jo golconda kaa shaasha tha or is kaaran adilshaah kaa shatru
 After the mediation of two chieftains of Bijapur, Shahaji Maharaj was freed on the condition that he would control Shivaji Maharaj
 agle chaar varshon tak shivaji maharaj ne bijipur ke kilaaf koi akraman nahin kiya
 During this time he organized his army
 shahji kii mukti kii sharton ke mutabik shivaji rajane bijapur ke kshetron par akraman to nahin kiya par unhone dakshin-pashchim main apni shakti badhaane kii cheshtaa kii
 But in this order the state of Javali was acting as a hindrance
 yah rajya satara ke sudur uttar pashchim main vama or krishna nadi ke bich main sthit tha
 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army
 chandrarav more or uske donon putron ne shivaji ke saath ladaai kii par ant main ve bandi bana liye gaye par chandrarav bhaag gaya
 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion
 isse shivaji ko us durg main sangrahit aath vanshon kii sampatti mil gai
 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army
 shivaji ke bijapur tathaa mughal donon shatru the
 At that time, Shahzada Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Deccan
 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin
 iske parinamswaroop aurangzeb shivaji se khafaa ho gaya or maitri vaarta samaapt ho gai
 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira
 par zanjeera ke siddiyon ke saath unki ladaai kai dinon tak chali
 After this Shivaji himself invaded Janjira and took control of South Konkan and collected annual tax from the Portuguese of Daman
 kalyaan tathaa bhiwandi par adhikaar karne ke baad vahaan nausainik adda bana liya
 By this time, Shivaji had become the owner of 40 fortifications
 idhar aurangzeb ke agra laut jane ke baad bijapur ke sultan ne bhi raahat kii saans lee
 Now Shivaji was the most powerful enemy of Bijapur
 shahji ko pehle hi apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha gaya tha par shahji ne isamen apni asamarthta jaahir kii
 The Sultan of Bijapur sent Abdullah Bhatari against Shivaji to deal with Shivaji
 afajal ne 12 xxrep 4 0 sainikon ke saath 1659 main kooch kiya
 Destroying the temples of Tuljapur, he came to Shiraval, 30 km north of Satara
 par shivaji pratapgarh ke durg par hi rahe
 Afzal Khan sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar for a treaty
 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya 
 After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji took control of the fort of Panhala
 iske baad pavangadh or vasantgarh ke durgon par adhikaar karne ke saath hi saath unhone rustam khan ke akraman ko vifal bhi kiya
 With this they also captured Rajapur and Dawul
 ab bijapur main aatank kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya or vahaan ke samanton ne aapasi matbhed bhulaakar shivaji par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 2 October 1665, the Bijapuri army captured the Panhala fort
 shivaji sankat main funs chuke the par raatri ke andhkaar kaa laabh uthaakar ve bhaagane main safal rahe
 The Sultan of Bijapur, taking command himself, withdrew his authority over Panhala, Pawangarh, looted Rajapur and killed the head of Shringargarh
 isi samay karnataka main siddijohar ke vidroh ke kaaran bijapur ke sultan ne shivaji ke saath samjhauta kar liya
 Shivaji's father Shahaji acted as a mediator in this treaty
 san 1662 main hui is sandhi ke anusaar shivaji ko bijapur ke sultan dwaara swatantra shaasha kii manyata mili
 According to this treaty, the area ranging from Kalyan in the north to Ponda in the south and from Indapur in the east to Davul in the west came under Shivaji's control
 shivaji kii sena main is samay tak 3 xxrep 4 0 paidal or 1000 ghudsavaar ho gaye the
 After the end of the race to become king in North India, Aurangzeb's attention shifted to the south
 wo shivaji kii badhati prabhutaa se parichit tha or usne shivaji par niyantran rakhane ke udyeshy se apane mamaa shysta khan ko dakshin kaa soobedaar niyukt kiya
 Shaiska Khan took 1,50,000 fos and took control of the fort of Supan and Chakan and reached Poona
 usne 3 saal tak mawal main lutmar ki
 One night Shivaji attacked him with his 350 Mavalos
 shysta to khidki ke raste batch nikalne main kaamyaab rahaa par use isi kram main apni chaar anguliyon se haath dhonaa padaa
 The sons of Shaista Khan, and forty guards and countless soldiers were slaughtered
 is ghatana ke baad aurangzeb ne shysta ko dakkan ke badale bengal kaa soobedaar bana diya or shahjada muajjam shysta kii jagah lene bheja gaya
 This victory increased Shivaji's reputation
 6 saal shaista khan ne apni 15 xxrep 4 0 fuj lekar raja shivaji kaa pura mulukh jalaakar tabah kar diya tha
 Therefore, Shivaji started looting in the Mughal territories to recover his damages
 surat us samay pashchimi vyapaariyon kaa garh tha or hindustani musalamaanon ke liye haj par jane kaa dwaar
 It was a prosperous city and its port was very important
 shivaji ne chaar hajaar kii sena ke saath 1664 main chah dinon tak surat ke dhanadya vyapaariyon ko lutaa
 They did not rob the common man and then returned
 is ghatana kaa zikr dach tathaa angrejon ne apane lekhon main kiya he
 By that time, European traders had settled in India and other Asian countries
 nadir shah ke bharat par akraman karne tak kisi bhi europea shakti ne bhartiya mughal samrajya par akraman karne kii nahin sochi thi
 Disgusted by the loot of Shivaji in Surat, Aurangzeb appointed Gaiyasuddin Khan as a faujdar of Surat in place of Inayat Khan
 or shahjada muajjam tathaa upasenapati raja jaswant singh kii jagah diler khan or raja jaisingh kii niyukti kii gai
 King Jai Singh attacked Shivaji with the support of Sultan of Bijapur, European powers and small feudatories
 is yuddh main shivaji ko haani hone lagi or haar kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue shivaji ne sandhi kaa prastaav bheja
 According to this treaty in June 1665, Shivaji will give 23 fortifications to the Mughals and thus only 12 fort will be left with him
 in 23 durgon se hone vaali aamadani 4 lakh hun salanaa thi
 The areas of Balaghat and Konkan will be given to Shivaji, but he will have to pay 40 lakh Huns in 13 installments in return
 iske alaava prativarsh 5 lakh hun kaa rajasav bhi ve denge
 Shivaji himself will be free from being in Aurangzeb's court, but his son Shambhaji will have to fight in the Mughal court
 bijapur ke kilaaf shivaji mughalon kaa saath denge
 Shivaji was called to Agra where he felt that he was not getting proper respect
 iske kilaaf unhone apana rosh bhare darbar main dikhaaya or aurangzeb par vishwasghaat kaa aarope lagaaya
 Aurangzeb was angered by this and he saw Shivaji being detained and guarded by 5000 soldiers
 kuch hi dinon baad raja shivaji ko maar daalane kaa iraadaa aurangzeb kaa tha
 But both Shivaji and Sambhaji, with their courage and courage, managed to escape from it
 sambhaaji ko mathura main ek vishwasi brahman ke yahan chhod shivaji maharaj banaras, gayi, puri hote hue sakushal rajgad pahunch gaye 
 This gave the Marathas a new life
 aurangzeb ne jaisingh par shaq karke uski hatya vish dekar karvaa daali

 This temple is situated on the high inaccessible hills of the Himalayas, so one has to walk on foot to reach here
 mandir tak pahunchne ke liye chamoli ke mandal naamak sthaan tak motor maarg he
 You can reach Rishikesh by train or bus
 uske baad srinagar or gopeshwar hote hue mandal pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 There is a trek of five kilometers from the temple to the temple of Mother, on which devotees have to walk on foot
 mandir tak jane vaale raste ke aarambh main padane vaala mandal gaanv faldaar pedon se bharaa hua he
 The mountain fruit here is rich in Malta
 gaanv ke paas bahati kalakal chal chal karti nadi padayatri ko parvat shikhar tak pahunchne ko utsahit karti rahati he
 Ansuiya enchants forests of oaks, burans and cedars on the way to the temple
 maarg main uchit duriyon par vishram sthal or pine ke pani kii paryaapt uplabdhta he jo yatri kii thakaan mitaane ke liye kaaphi hai
 When the traveler approaches the temple, first of all he sees a grand idol of Ganesha, which is built on a rock
 kaha jaataa he ki yah shila yahaan par prakritik rup se he
 Seeing this, it seems as if Ganesha is sitting here, leaning to the right in a relaxed posture
 yahaan par anasuia naamak ek chota sa gaanv he jahaan par bhavy mandir he
 The temple is built in the Nagara style
 aisa kaha jaataa he jab atri muni yahaan se kuch hi duuri par tapasya kar rahe the to unki patni anasuia ne pativrat dharm kaa paalan karte hue is sthaan par apana nivas banaaya tha
 Kavindati says that when the glory of Goddess Anasuiya began to be sung in all the three worlds, Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati forced Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh to test Anusuiya's husbandry religion
 puranic katha ke anusaar tab ye tridev devi anasuia kii pariksha lene sadhuvesh main unke ashram pahunchein or unhone bhojan kii ichha prakat kii
 But she kept a watch in front of Anusuiya that she would sit on his lap and feed him naked with a hug
 is par anasuia sanshay main pads gai
 When he remembered his husband with closed eyes, he saw Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh standing as sadhus standing in front
 anusuia ne man hi man apane pati kaa samaran kiya or ye tridev chah maheene ke shishu ban gaye
 Then Mata Ansuiya fed the Tridevs according to their feet
 is prakaar tridev balyarup kaa anand lene lage
 On the other hand, the three women became unhappy at the disconnection of husbands
 tab naarad muni ke kehane par ve anasuia ke samaksh apane patiyon ko mul rup main laane kii prarthana karne lageen
 On the strength of his perseverance, Anasuiya brought the three gods back to the east
 tabhi se vah maa sati anasuia ke naam se prasiddh hui
 In the temple's womb lies the magnificent stone statue of Anasuya, on which is placed a silver umbrella
 mandir parisar main shiv, parvati, bhairav, ganesh or vanadevataaon kii murtiyon virajman hai
 The Trimukhi stone statue of Anasuiya's son, Lord Dattatreya, is situated at a distance from the temple
 ab yahaan par ek chota sa mandir banaaya gaya he
 The bird's eye view of Maharishi Atri's cave and the waterfall called Atri Dhara, at a short distance from the temple, is a center of attraction for the lovers and adventure tourism enthusiasts as one has to do rock climbing to catch the cave to reach the cave
 gupha main maharishi atri kii pashaan murti he
 The view of the Amrit Ganga and the waterfall outside the cave captivates the mind
 yahaan kaa jalprapaat shaayad desh kaa akelaa aisa jal prapaat he jisaki parikrama kii jaati he
 At the same time, Amritganga is circled without crossing it
 thaharne ke liye yahaan par ek chota loj uplabdh he
 Far from the glare of modern tourism, this area is also a second example of eco-friendly tourism
 yahaan bhawan paaramparik pathar or lakadiyon ke bane hai
 Every year a fair is organized here on the occasion of Anasuiya Putra Dattatreya Jayanti in the month of December

 There is also Jollygrant Airport nearby where you can reach by air

 Cheap and clean hotels are available in abundance in Gopeshwar for lodging
 gopeshwar se 13 kilometre kii duuri tay karne ke baad mandal naamak sthaan aata he
 By bus or taxi, you can easily reach the board and after climbing a steep distance of about 5-6 kilometers from the board, you can reach the Ansuiya Devi temple

 Also it is necessary to have light medicines with you
 himalay parvatashrinkhalaaon ke dakshinvarti bhubhag main kashmir ke purv se lekar nepal tak pahari bhashaayen boli jaati hai
 Grierson considered an independent community of Pahari languages when classifying modern Indian Aryan languages
 chatterjee ne inhen pashachi, darad athwa khas praakrit par aadhaarit maanakar madhyaka main inpar rajasthan kii praakrit evam apbhransh bhashaaon kaa prabhaav ghoshit kiya he
 According to a new opinion, the origin of at least Middle Pahari languages is Shaurseni Prakrit, which is also the origin of Rajasthani
 pahari bhashaaon ke shabdasmooh, dhvanisamooh, vyakaran aadi par anek jaateey staron kii chhap padi he
 The linguistic features of various castes like Yaksha, Kinnar, Kirat, Nag, Khas, Shaka, Arya etc
 can be discovered by trying, in which now the arya-aryan elements are mixed here
 aitihaasik drushti se aisa vidit hota he ki pracheen kaal main inkaa kuch pruthak swaroop adhikansh maukhik tha
 In the medieval period, this area came in more contact with the Rajasthani language speakers and due to the convenience of movement in modern times, Hindi linguistic elements are entering here
 pahari bhashaaon kaa vyavhaar ek prakaar se gharelu bolchaal, patravyavhaar aadi tak hi simit ho chalaa he
 Pahari languages have some phonetic features of the coarse languages such as Ghosha Mahapraan being replaced by a very low-sounding sound
 pashchimi tathaa madhya pahari pradesh kaa naam pracheen kaal main sampadalaksh tha
 Gurjars and other Rajput people continued to visit here during the medieval period, mainly because of the Muslim invasion
 at: sthaneey bhashaprayogon main jo adhikansh "na" ke sthaan par "na" tathaa acarant shabdon kii okarant pravriti lakshith hoti he, vah rajasthani prabhaav kaa dyotak he
 Eastern Hindi also has multiple trends in the Middle Pahari languages because the Katyura dynasty here belonged to the king of Suryavanshi Ayodhya
 is aadhaar par pahari bhashaaon kaa sambandh ardh-magadhi-kshetra ke saath bhi spasht ho jaataa he
 Considering their present form, two elements mainly emerge
 ek to yah ki pahari bhashaaon kii ekaadhik visheshta inhen hindi bhashaa se bhinn karti hai
 Some other elements are similar to both
 kahin to hindi shabd sthaneey shabdon ke saath vaikalpik rup se prayukt hote hai or kahin hindi shabd hi sthaneey shabdon kaa sthaan grahan karte ja rahe hai
 Some foreign words, such as "shaving", "hospital", "lace", "oyster", "doggar", etc
 have also been introduced through the Khadi dialect
 pahari bhashaaon ke teen bhed nirdhaarit kiye ja sakate hai : It is also called Nepali or "khaskura"
 "gorkhali" isi ke antargat he
 There is enough written literature in it
 ye kumaun evam gadhwal main boli jaati hai at: isi aadhaar par "kumaunni" tathaa "gadhwali" ke naam se prasiddh hai
 Their areas are the seven Parvatya districts of Uttar Pradesh and their number of speakers is about 16 lakhs
 kumaunni bhashaa jila nainital, almoda tathaa pithauragarh main prayukt hoti he
 Its area is presently about 8000 square miles and according to the census of 1951, its number of speakers is about 570,008
 hindi dwitiya bhashaa ke rup main prayukt hoti he
 Due to this, Kumaoni has come very close to the Hindi Khadi dialect
 vyakaran kii drushti se sarvanaamon main - mai, tu, ham, tum, uu, uun, kaa prayog chalata he
 The plural form of affinity is "uner" rather than "them"
 hindi kii bhanti kumaunni main do hi ling prayukt hote hai or yah lingatv keval purushatv, stritv ke bhed par aadhaarit nahin pratyut vastu ke aakaar tathaa swabhaav par bhi nirbhar he
 There are two words, and almost all the metals of Hindi are found
 padakram, evam vaakyavinyas bhi miltaa julata he
 In the beginning the subject is the verb at the end
 kriyavisheshan bhi hindi kii bhanti kriya ke purv aata he
 Nevertheless, some sounds in Kumaoni are distinctly different from those of Khadi Boli Hindi
 swaron kii drushti se hrasv "aa", hrasv "e", hrasv "i", hrasv "o" tathaa hvasv "ou" dhvaniyaan dekhi ja sakati hai
 This distinction has made a difference of semantics
 jaise, "kaanv" shabd kaa kumaunni main arth hai - "kaala" or "kaav" shabd kaa arth hota he "kaal" - arthath mrityu
 Special "N" and special "L" are available in dishes
 "kan", "bhaan" jaise shabdon main vishisht "na" dhwani he jiskaa uccharan kuch talvya kii ore jhukaa hua he
 The special "L" letter is found in the dialects of Gangoli and Kali Kumaon
 kumaunni kii aath boliyaan hai - khasrajia, kumyyan, pachhaayi, danpuria, sormali, sheerali, gangola, bhotiya
 The script of the Kumaoni language is Devanagari
 iskaa maukhik sahitya bada samrudh he, yadhyapi likhit sahitya bhi kam mahatvapurn nahin
 Ancient elements in Garhwali language are still safer than Kumaoni
 iskaa vyavhaar jila gadhwal, tehari, chamoli, tathaa uttar kaashi main hota he
 This area is about 10,000 sq
 m and the number of Garhwali speakers is about 1 million
 yahan bhugolic kaarnon se avaagaman kii kathinaaiyaan hai
 Therefore, characteristics have emerged in linguistic experiments of people living on both sides of the mountains or across the same river
 uttar kii boliyon main tibeti, tathaa purv kii ore kumaunni prabhaav spasht hota gaya he kyonki in kshetron kii seemayen mili hui hai
 Being the residence of Rajput castes, Garhwali has an unrestrained influence on it, and its dialect standing towards the south-west is also making its impact
 gadhwali bhashaa kii kuch visheshtaayen drashtavy hai
 Its inclination is towards elongation, hence the sounds of A, Ai, O, and Au, which have a long form predominant, are used more in vowels
 anunasikta kii pravriti apekshaakrit kam hai
