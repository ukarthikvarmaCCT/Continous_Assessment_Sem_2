 The specification work is an ongoing task and is expected to remain so for many years, although parts of HTML5 are expected to be finished before the entire specification reaches the final recommended level and in browsers They can be implemented
 W3C samay saarini ke anusaar, yah anumaan he ki achtmal5 W3C anushansa tak 2010 tak pahunch jaayegaa
 However, the first public working draft was able to arrive 8 months after its expected date and the last call and candidate recommendation was expected to reach 2008, but as of July 2010, HTML5, W3C still has working draft levels
 But only
 achtmal5, oktober 2009 se WHATWG main antim kol str par he
 The editor of the HTML5 specification Ian Hixon hopes that these specifications will reach Candidate Recommendation Level during 2012
 The following criteria are required for these specifications to become W3C recommendations - "two 100% complete and fully interconnected implementations"
 In an interview with techpublic, Hixon speculates that this will likely happen in the year 2022 or later
 However, many parts of the specification are static and can be implemented in products: Some sections are already relatively stable and there are implementations that are already quite close to completion, and those features can be used today

 duusari ore, mul mazal-loding rifl, jisamen grouves ko rifl karne ke liye goliyaan zyada najdiki se feet kii jaati thi, use lod karnaa zyada mushkil tha, vishesh rup se tab bairal kaa bor pichhali firing se kharaab ho gaya ho
 isi kaaran se, praarambhik riflon kaa upyog sainya uddeshyon ke liye nahin kiya jaataa tha
 The first fifty years of the nineteenth century saw distinct changes in the shape and function of the bullet
 1826 main, ek francisi infentry adhikari, delvigne ne asambaddh kandhon se yukt ek brich kaa avishkaar kiya, jis par ek golakaar goli ko tab tak ghusaaya gaya jab tak yah rifl kii grouves main lod naa ho jaye
 However, Delvigne's method was not correct and it distorted the bullet
 nukili yaa "shanku ke aakaar kii" goliyon kii shrinkhalaa main pehali goli ko 1823 main british sena ke captin jon norton ke dwaara dizin kiya gaya tha
 Norton's bullet had a hollow base which, for rifling the barrel, spread with pressure when firing
 british aayudh board ne ise asweekrut kar diya kyonki golakaar goli kaa upyog pichley 300 saalon se kiya ja rahaa tha
 In 1836, the greener pellet was invented by William Greener, the famous English shotgun maker
 yah norton kii goli se bahut adhik milti julati thi, isamen ek antar yah tha ki iske khokhale aadhaar main ek lakdi kaa plag feet kar diy gaya tha jo rifling ko vistrut karne or pakadaney ke liye aadhaar par adhik nishchit dabaav daalata tha
 The test proved that Greiner's pill was very effective but it was rejected for military use, as it was believed to be very difficult to manufacture due to its two parts
 mulaayam sise kii mini ball ko francisi sena ke ek captain, clade etini mini ne 1847 main jari kiya
 It was almost like a greener pill
 mini ke dwaara dizin kii gayi goli shanku ke akar kii thi iske rear main ek khokhli guha thi, jisamen lakdi ke plag ke bajaay choti lohe kii topi feet kii gayi thi
 When it was fired, that is, the iron cap went into a hollow cave on the rear of the bullet, by which the bullet's sides were spread to strengthen the raffling
 1855 main, british ne apni enfield rifl ke liye mini ball ko apanaaya
 The Mini Ball was first used most during the American Civil War
 mote taur par is yuddh main, 90% hataahaton kii sankhya rifl se fire kii gayi mini balls ke kaaran hui
 Between 1854 and 1857, Sir Joseph Witworth conducted a long series of experiments on the rifle and, among other points, proved the advantages of the short bore and, in particular, the advantages of the longer bullet
 vitworth kii goli is prakaar se banaayi gayi thi ki rifl kii grouves main yantric rup se feet kii ja sake
 vitworth kii goli ko sarkaar ke dwaara kabhi bhi nahin apanaaya gaya, haalanki 1857 or 1866 ke bich match uddeshyon or lakshya abhyaas ke liye inkaa upyog bade paimaane par kiya gaya, jab dhire dhire metford ke dwaara ise pratisthapit kiya gaya
 Around and after 1862, W

 Metford conducted many experiments on bullets and rifles and invented an important system of light rifling with increasing spiral and a hardened bullet
 iskaa sanyukt parinaam yah hua ki disambar 1888 main lee-metford kii chote bor kii rifl, mark I, ko antat british sena ke dwaara apana liya gaya
 lee-metford was the predecessor of lee-enfield
 rifl kii goli ke itihaas main aglaa mahatvapurn parivartan 1882 main aayaa jab, edward rubin, jo thun main swiss sena prayogshaala ke nideshak the, ne ek tambe ke jacket vaali goli kaa avishkaar kiya-yah ek lambi goli thi jiskaa sise kaa kor ek tambe kii jacket main rakhaa gaya tha
 It was also small bore and was a successor to the 8mm "label bullet" adopted for the smokeless powder ammo of the Mle 1886 label rifle
 tej gati se fire kii gayi sise kii goliyon kii sataha pigal sakati he aisa peeche upasthit garm gaison or bor ke saath gharshan ke kaaran hota he
 Because the melting point of copper is high and the specific heat and hardness values are also high, the muzzle speed increases due to the bullets present in the copper jacket
 vayugatiki main aadhunikeekaran ke kaaran nukili spitzar goli kaa vikaas hua
 By the early twentieth century, most of the world's armies had become infected with Spitzer bullets
 in goliyon ko zyada sateek rup se adhik duuri tak daaga ja saktaa tha or inamen adhik urja hoti thi
 The combination of Spitzer bullets and machine guns greatly increased the lethality of war
 bullate yaa goli kii akruti main sabase aadhunik navinikaran jo hua, vah he naav jaisi poonch, spitzar bullate ke liye ek aadharekhit aadhaar
 High when the air rapidly passes over the end of the bullet, a vacuum is created, which reduces the velocity of the projectile
 aadharekhit naav jaisi poonch kaa dizin, iske antim sire kii sataha par hawa ke pravaah kii anumati detaa he, jisase yah form dreg kam ho jaataa he
 The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as a favorable shape for rifle technology
 spitzar or naav jaisi poonch vaali goli ke pehle sangyojan ko iske khojakarta ke naam par bel "di" naam diya gaya he, ise francisi label model 1886 rifl ke liye, 1901 main maanak sainya barood ke rup main jari kiya gaya
 Two primary problems have to be resolved in the design of a bullet
 unamem pehle bandook ke bor ke saath ek sil banaayi jaani chahie
 agar ek majboot sil nahin banaayi jaati he, bullate ke nikal jane ke baad pranodak charge se gas li hogi, jo isi dakshata ko kam kar degi
 Bullets should work in the rifling process in such a way that there is no damage to the bore of the gun
 goliyon par ek aisi sataha honi chahie jo bahut zyada gharshan paidaa kiye bina is sil kaa nirmaan kare
 This interaction between the bullet and the bore is called internal ballistics
 goliyon kaa utpaadan unche maanak par kiya janaa chahie, kyonki satahi virupata firing kii sateekta ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 The physics affecting the bullet after it comes out of the barrel is called external ballistics
 udaan bhar rahi ek goli kii vayugatiki ko prabhavit karne vaale kaarak hai goli kii akruti or bandook kii bairal kii rifling ke dwaara utpann ghurnan
 Rotational forces stabilize the bullet aerodynamically and gyroscopically
 goli yaa bullate main kisi bhi prakaar ki asamamiti bade paimaane par radd ho jaati he jab yah spin hoti he
 With smooth bore guns, a spherical shape was favorable because no matter how it was oriented, it presented a flat front
 ye asthir goliyaan anishchit rup se gir jaati thim, yaa avyavasthit rup se aage peeche ludhakne lagati thim or keval madhyam sateekta uplabdh karaati thim, haalaanki vayugathik akruti main sadiyon main bahut kam parivartan aayaa
 Generally, bullet shapes were a compromise between aerodynamics, internal ballistics requirements, and end ballistics requirements
 goli ke dravyaman centre ke liye sthirikaran kii ek or vidhi he aage utani duuri par rahanaa jitna ki vyavhaar main mini ball yaa shatalkock main hota he
 This allows the bullet to fly forward towards the front through aerodynamics
 dekhen terminal prakshepiki or / yaa goli kaa dijin kaise prabhavit karata he iske rokane kii kshamta kaa avlokan karen, kya hota he jab ek goli ek vaastu ko prabhavit karti he
 The result of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material, the angle of incidence, and the velocity and physical properties of the bullet itself
 goli ko aamtaur par is prakaar se dizin kiya jaataa he ki yah lakshya ko bhed sake, use viroopit kar sake or / yaa use tod sake
 For a given material and bullet, the hitting velocity is the primary factor that determines the result
 vastav main goli kii kai akritiyaan hai or ye kai prakaar kii hai or unki ek sarini ko kisi bhi reloding menual main praapt kiya ja saktaa he jo bullate mould ko bechati he
 RCBS is one of several manufacturers offering several different designs, starting with a basic round ball
 ek mould ke saath, koi apane gole barood ko relod karne ke liye goliyon ko ghar par bhi bana saktaa he, jahaan sthaneey kanoon is baat kii anumati dete hai
 Hand casting, however, is only time- and cost-effective for solid lead tablets
 cast or jacket se yukt goliyaan bhi vyavsaayik rup se haath ladaan ke liye asankhya nirmaataaon ke dwaara uplabdh karaayi gayi hai or ye sise kii casting goliyon se kahin adhik suvidhajanak hai
 Bullets were manufactured by casting pure lead to guns or black powder loaded from the muzzle
 yah kam gati kii bulats ke liye acchhee tarah se kaam karti thi, jinhen 450 m / s se kam veg par daaga jaataa tha
 For slightly higher speed bullets fired by modern guns, a more hard alloy of lead and tin or typesetter's lead is preferable
 or adhik zyada gati kii goliyon ke liye, jacket yukt bulats kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The common element in all of these is lead, which is used extensively because of its high density and therefore it provides more mass — and thus, produces more kinetic energy for a given volume
 sisa sasta bhi hota he, ise praapt karnaa aasaan he, is par kaam karnaa aasaan he, yah kam taapmaana par pigal jaataa he, inhen sab kaarnon se goliyaan yaa bulats banane main inkaa upyog karnaa aasaan he
 It can also be said that lead is toxic, making it a more dangerous weapon
 saint petersburg kii 1868 kii ghoshnaa main 400 gram se kam vajan ke visphotak projectile ke upyog ko nishiddh kar diya gaya
 The Hague Convention prohibits the use of special types of ammo by uniformed military personnel against uniformed military personnel on the opposing side
 inamen ve projectile shaamil hai jo ek vyaktigat, visheile or expending bullate ke bheetar visphotit hote hai
 In Protocol III of the 1983 Convention on Special Conventional Weapons, relating to the Geneva Conventions, the use of ammo to fire against civilians was prohibited
 in sandhiyon main koi bhi tressor ko nishiddh nahin karti he yaa sainya upkarnon main nishiddh goliyon kii baat karti he
 These treaties even apply to 
22 LR bullets used in pistols, rifles and machine guns

 hamaari prithvi or surya jis gallexi main avasthit hai, raatri main ham nangi aankh se usee gallexi ke taaraon ko dekh pate hai
 So far, there are estimated to be about 19 billion galaxies in every part of the universe that has been detected

 a hundred billion galaxies exist in the universe
 jo badi maatra main taare, gas or khagoleey dhul ko samete hue he
 Galaxies began their lives millions of years ago and gradually regained their present form

 Gravity binds the stars together, and in this way many galaxies live together in a cluster of stars

 Wright refute this notion by studying the interactions of four groups of galaxies
 unhone yah bataaya ki gallexiyon ke bich main aisi visphotak antar kriyaayein nahin hoti hai jo nai gallexiyon ko janm de saken
 The center of most galaxies is a spherical part filled with stars, called the nucleus, and the nucleus is attached to a planar circular disk around it
 khagolvigyaani gallexiyon ko unke aakaar ke aadhaar par mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main vibhajit karaten he
 Nobody knows why galaxies assume a certain form

 If one considers the form of the galaxy in a three-dimensional recess instead of the one seen in the sky, then it is found that the galaxy is almost like a flat circular wheel whose part near the axis is somewhat bloated
 chitra main gallexi kaa bagal se chitra dikhaaya gaya he 
 The diameter of this wheel is about one million light years, miles or 63 thousand times the distance of the Sun from Earth) and the thickness is between 3,000 and 6,000 light years

 The stars in our Galaxy are not evenly distributed

 The mass of our galaxy is approximately one trillion times the mass of the Sun
 isamen se praaia: aadha to taron kaa dravyaman he or aadha dhuli or gas kaa
 Our Galaxy is like a puffed circle in the middle

 Stars and galaxies are scattered sparsely around our galaxy
 hamaari gallexi ke centre ke paas taare sankhya main adhik ghaney hai or kinare kii ore apekshaakrit bikhare hue hai
 All the stars are rotating around the center, the stars near the center are at high speed and the far ones are at low speed
 hamaara surya centre se lagbhag 30-35 hajaar prakashavarsh dur he or gallexi ke madhya tal main hai
 For this reason, we see our galaxy like the mekhala which is described above
 prithvi se gallexi kaa centre dhanu taramandal kii ore he
 That's why it revolves around the center of the Galaxy
 is parikrama main uskaa veg 150 mile prati senkad hai
 Even at this velocity, the sun takes 200 million years in the entire orbit
 kuch teevr gativale taare or goleey targuch hamaari gallexi kii seemaa ke baahar hai, kintu ye bhi hamaari gallexi se sambhddha hai or usee ke ang maane jate hai lagbhag 100 goleey taraguchh gyaat hai
 Their distribution is spherical
 in taragucchon ke vitaran se gallexi kaa centre gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Measuring the speed of wires also helps in the calculation of the center

 cricket ke khel main pagabaadha ) ballebaaj ko out karne kii ek vidhi he
 An umpire declares a batsman to be LBW out under a series of circumstances, when the ball that can hit the batsman's wicket primarily hits the batsman's body
 elbeadblyoo niyam ko isliye banaaya gaya tha taaki gend ko wicket se na takaraane dene ke liye ballebaaj apane balle ke sthaan par sharir kaa istemaal na kare
 LBW is commonly known as the most complex rule of the game
 leg bifor wicket shabd main leg kaa prayog hone ke baavjood, yah niyam tab bhi lagu hota he jab balla thaamne vaale haath ke dastaane ko chhod kar gend ballebaaj ke sharir ke kisi anya hisse se takaraae
 The rule of LBW was not included in the rules of cricket until 1744
 sarvapratham is niyam kaa prayog 1774 main hua, jiske anusaar: ballebaaj ko out mana jayega yadi xxrep 5 
 yaa phir ballebaaj gend ko rokane ke liye apni taang wicket ke saamne adaae or gend ko wicket se takaraane se roak de
 While the use of the LBW rule was most definitely caused by the batsman deliberately snapping legs and feet in order not to hit the ball with the wicket, early writers such as John Nairn were known for this deliberate work by Tom Taylor and Joey Ring is considered responsible
 haalanki, unka kareer 1774 ke baad shuru hua or, jaisaa ki arthur hegarth bataate hai, " in paraspar virdohi bayanon main ab saamanjasy sthapit karnaa asambhav he"
 For this reason the rule of LBW was not recorded for many years
 agast 1795 main maulsi hurst main hue sarre banaam england ekadash ke match main jon tafton ko jon wales dwaara elbeadblyoo niyam ke tahat out kiya gaya tha
 According to Hegarth: In this match, for the first time it was found that "pagbadha" has been recorded
 In Brisher's printed score-book, in this match Mr
 J
 Tftan is simply described as bold, and the note is written lamb
 shuruyaat main, jab koi bhi ballebaaj is tareeke se out hota tha, to keval aisa likhaa jaataa tha ki vah bold hua he or pagabaadha nahin likhaa jaataa tha
 In essence, the essence of this rule is: yadi gend ballebaaj se takaraati he jo ki wicket se takaraane vaali thi, to use elbeadblyoo qaraar diya jaataa he, jab tak ki: Note: Balls falling off the leg side mean that fifty percent or more of the ball must be outside the leg stump
 iske alaava, of stump se baahar ballebaaj se takaraane vaali gend kaapchaas pratishat yaa isse adhik hissaa of stump kii line ke baahar ballebaaj se takaraana chahie
 Despite its complications, the catch (after catch and bold) is the most common type of dismissal in cricket
 ek ballebaaj ko elbeadblyoo out qaraar dene kii sharten nimna hai: There are three rules to explain these situations: The exception to this involves the umpire's decision whether the batsman has attempted to hit the ball or not
 is niyam ko isliye banaaya gaya he taaki ballebaaj of stump se baahar gend ko sirf pad par na khele, jisase balle se gend takaraa kar kaich dene kii sambhaavna samaapt ho jaati he
 a common defensive strategy against spin bowlers is to use pads to avoid the ball at the off stump, but the LBW rule means that their bat is close to the pad, allowing fielders standing in the slip to catch a catch, or their LBW likely to be out
 richi banode jaise kuch samikshakon ne sujhaayaa he ki elbeadblyoo niyam ko kuch is prakaar badalanaa chahie ki leg stump se thodi baahar tappa padane par bhi ballebaaj ko out qaraar diya ja sake, jisase legspinron ko madad milegi or nakaaratmak pad-play se bachaa ja sakegaa
 The LBW rule is always reviewed by the umpire standing at the bowler's end
 agar kshetrarakshan karne vaali team kaa maananaa he ki ek ballebaaj elbeadblyoo out ho saktaa he, to unhen nirnay ke liye ampire se anurodh karnaa chahie
 All lbw conditions must be evaluated for the ball, which takes half a second to reach the batsman
 niyamon ke anya pahaluon ke rup main, ballebaaj ko hameshaa kisi bhi andeh kaa laabh diya jaataa he, isliye, yadi ampire santusht nahin he, to anurodh ko thukraa diya jayega
udhaaharan ke rup main yadi gend ke ballebaaj se takaraane se pehle ballebaaj ek kadam aage bad jaataa he
 The ball may have hit the wicket in the future, but it is very difficult for an umpire to be sure that the ball will be 1
5–2 meters from the wicket when the batsman hits the leg
 televijan riple ke madhyam se ab yah bataanaa saral ho gaya he ki elbeadblyoo kii sabhi sharton ko puraa kiya gaya tha yaa nahin or isliye kuch log shikaayat karte hai ki ek ampire ne ballebaaj ko galat tareeke se khel jari rakhane ke liye kaha yaa use galat tareeke se out qaraar de diya
 However, before an umpire gives a batsman out, one must be sure that he is out or not and since they do not have any facilities like TV replays, the decision of the umpire is usually justified
 adhikansh khiladi or camentator is nirnay ko sweekaar karte hai or ampiron kii aalochana bahut kam hoti he
 LBW is arguably the most difficult of the umpires to decide, and may cause comment and controversy among viewers
 haal ke varshon main, cricket main badhate dabaav or daanv par lage paison ke kaaran kai log anishchit maamalon main camaron kii bhoomika ko badhaane or hoque-ai jaisi simulation takanic ke prayog par jor de rahe hai
 At the moment, LBW is a decision that is only taken by the umpire standing on the field
 tathaapi badlaav kii hawa chal padi he: sitambar 2005 main, antarrashtriya cricket parishad ne ampiron dwaara televijan riple ke madhyam se nirnay lene main sahaayta karne ke liye ek pareekshan ko adhikrut kiya
 
 yah dhyaan dene yogya he ki yadi gend pehle pad se takaraati he or phir balle se takaraati he, to ballebaaj ko elbeadblyoo out ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he lekin yadi ballebaaj gend ko balle se martha he tathaa iske baad gend uske pad se takaraati he, to ballebaaj ko us maamle main out ghoshit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 However, in both cases, there is a risk of a batsman being caught out as the ball may bounce relatively slowly and be caught by a fielder
 yadi gend bina tappa khaae ballebaaj se takaraae, to us sthiti main gend ke tappa padane ke baad ke kisi bhi sambhavit vichlan ko andekha karte hue ampaire ko gend kii gati evam oochaal dwaara isaki disha kaa anumaan lagaana padataa he
 However, the umpire may take into account the swing or flow of the ball before determining whether the ball will hit the wicket
 agar gend swing kar rahi he to ampaire ko yah anumaan lagane kii anumati he ki gend usee disha main swing hogi athwa nahin
 There is a misconception that the batsman cannot get out lbw when the ball hits the leg stump
 aamtaur par aisa mana jaataa he ki leg stump ke baahar tappa khaane vaali gend kaa parinaam note out hoga, tathaapi elbeadblyoo kanoon ke kii sateek paribhaasha or no ball kii vartmaan paribhaasha ke anusaar, ek asaamaanya paristhiti main iskaa apwaad bhi he
 24
6 Under the rule, a ball will be considered a valid ball only if it bounces twice
 The 36
1 rule states that if the ball "hits the ball in a straight line between the wicket to wicket or the batsman's off-side wicket if it does not stop before it collapses", then the batsman is out lbw
 " yahaan dhyaan dene yogya he ki, niyam 36
1 main leg said kaa koi ullekh nahin he, na hi isamen kaha gaya he ki aisi sthiti ek se adhik baar ho
 is prakaar ek gend jo ki do baar uchhalati he, kaa parinaam elbeadblyoo ho saktaa he bhale hi usame ek tappa leg stump kii line se baahar ho
 antarrashtriya cricket main aaj tak koi bhi ballebaaj is dhang se out nahin hua he
 LBW is a term used on 21 November 1934 to describe a change in footpath rule made by the Marilybon Cricket Club
 1935 main yah england main astitv main aayaa tha, lekin australia main ucch str ke adhikariyon dwaara iskaa virodh kiya gaya jahaan yah 1936 / 1937 satr tak lagu nahin ho sakaa tha, haalanki australia main 1935 / 1936 ke satr ke dauraan club maichon main ise lagu karne kii koshish kii gai thi
 According to this change, LBW out can be declared even if it falls outside the off stump if the batsman prevents it from any part of his body in the straight line between wicket to wicket
 isse pehle, sirf gendbaaj ke chor tathaa ballebaaj kii viketon ke bich kii sidhi rekha main padane vaali gendon dwaara hi elbeadblyoo out kiya ja saktaa tha
 The term "LBW" refers to the fact that in the scorecards published by Wisden from 1935 to 1937, the wickets taken by the new turban rule were different from the wickets of the earlier rules of 1935
 1920 evam 1930 ke dashak ke dauraan pratham shrenee cricket kii visheshta ballebaajon dwaara gendbaajon par badhata prabhutv tha
 With a world record of 1107 runs by Victoria against New South Wales on MCG in 1926 / 1927, Australia had an exceptionally high run rate during the 1920s
 1928 main, county cricket main ek wicket lene kii ausat keemat 30 ran thi jo 1901 kii apni pichhali ucch keemat 27
5 ko paar kar gai thi
 Attempts to block the number of runs allowed by the LBW decision, regardless of whether the batsman played the ball, were partially successful in 1929, but during the 1930s test matches showed extremely high runs and many draw matches
 That it was only a transient effect and by 1934 this experiment was abolished
 adhikariyon ke saamne yah spasht tha ki harbart satakliff or phil mid jaise acha pad play khilne vaale ballebaaj ucch ransankhya tathaa dra maichon kii babbti sankhya ke liye jimmedaar the
 Therefore, the purpose of protecting the balls falling out of the off stump was not only to combat pad play but also to discourage fast "bodyline" bowling by rewarding bowlers who bowl the off stump and hence the off side
 Was encouraged to play attractive strokes
 1934 main isaki atyadhik vivechna hui or yah aam taur par sahmati bani ki of said par elbeadblyoo niyam kaa ek vistaar rakshaatmak pad play ko kam kar saktaa he
 The Erold Larvud like some people's feet demanding to be given lbw agreement on any ball falling outside off stump even if the batsman also do not do well outside off stump - which is considered since 1970 to some extent has gone

 Alcohol fermentation in yeast fermentation is half the percentage of fermented sugars and theoretically the acetic acid must be higher than the alcohol, as oxygen is added to the second action, but it is the same in use because some alcohols are bacteria
 And some are destroyed by evaporation

 Paleontology or paleontology or palaeontology is a branch of geology that deals with the remains of animals and plants of the geological ages which are now found only in the rocks of the earth's crust
 jeevashmiki kii paribhaasha dete hue tweb hofel or aak ne likhaa he : jeevashmiki vah vigyaan he, jo aadim paudhen tathaa jantuon ke ashmibhoot avasheshon dwaara prakat bhootkaaleen bhugarbhik yugon ke jeevanaki vyakhya karata he
 Thus it is clear that paleontology studies primitive animals on the basis of their volatile remains
 jeevashm shabd se hi yah ingit hota he ki jeev + ashm kaa adhyayan he
 The term Palaentology in English also refers to the study of Palaios = Ancient + Onto = Fauna
 jeevashm vigyaan kaa adhyayan jeevigyaan kii nai shakha he or iskaa vikaas gat 200 varshon se hi adhik hua he
 Long before the development of this branch of science, it was in the knowledge of the primitive human beings that in some types of rocks, a strange type of remains are found which correspond to marine organisms
 gyaan ke abhaav main usne pehle-pahal in avasheshon ko jaivik utpatti kaa na samajhakar, prakruti ke vinod kii saamagree samaj rakhaa tha, jo prithvi ke andar kisi shakti ke kaaran ban gaye
 But, with the increase of knowledge, man had to change his thoughts in this direction too and he discovered that the remains of the remains found in the rocks were living creatures at some time and the place where Today we find these fossils was in the womb of the sea in geological ages
 san 1820 tak keval 127 ashmibhoot vanaspatiyon tathaa 2,100 jantuon kaa hi pataa chalaa tha, jo 1840 tak badhkar kramash: 2,050 tathaa 24,300 kii sankhya tak pahunch gaya
 Since then, these numbers have increased unprecedentedly

 Fossils are remnants of ancient creatures, which have become stone like stones in stones or other places
 jeevon ke kuch aise bhi avshesh praapt hue hai, jo prastirbhoot na hokar apane mul rup main hi hai
 Dead bodies of mammoths and other animals found in the icebergs are safe in museums in Russia and England and America

 Fossils help a lot in determining the identity of rocks and the sequence of these levels
 inaki kuch pramukh upyogitaayen nimnlikhit hai : Chronological - On the basis of evidence engraved in fossils or found in complete or incomplete form, the ancient geological condition is revealed
 kisi bhugarbhik kalvishesh kaa nirdhaaran karne main jeevashmon se bahut sahaayta milti he
 The stratigraphic position or stratum configuration has been considered to be inseparable relation to fossils
 prithvi par jo bhautik-rasinic parivartan pehle ho chuke hai, lagbhag vaise hi parivartan aaj bhi ho rahe hai
 However, organisms have evolved gradually

 The nature of mineral materials has been variable even though the nature of organic matter has changed

 But studying the sediments of fossils found between them makes this task simple
 kuch jeevashmon ko nirdeshak jeevashm kii sangya is aadhaar par de di gai he ki unase yah siddh ho jaataa he ki amuk jantu yaa vanaspati amuk bhugarbhik kaal main hi utpann hue yaa ho sakate hai
 Primitive surroundings - For the life of animals, whether they are vegetation, animals, special types of geographical environment are suitable
 duusare shabdon main kah sakate hai ki vishesh vaataavaran main vishesh prakaar ke jeev jantu jivit rahete hai
 The fossils reveal what kind of geographical environment was there for the living of the then living animals
 in jeevajantuon kii mrityu kis prakaar hui athwa kis sthaan par kis avasthaa main hui thi, isaki bhi ek jhalak jeevashm de dete hai
 Along with this, fossils throw a lot of light on the extent and extent of ancient land, sea, reservoir etc
, the migration of animals and birds etc
 inhen jeevashmon ke adhyayan kaa parinaam yah hua ki ki pracheenkaaleen bhaugalik maanchitron kii rachana saral evam sulabh ho sakati he

 Each fossil is in itself a proof of its own power of biology
 inke adhyayan se inke kramik vikaas par prachur prakaash padataa he
 The study of fossils suggests that there was a time in ancient times, when the Earth was invaded by dinosaur giant animals, or the surviving remains of Silacanthus fishes are probably gone
 isi prakaar, udvivikas sambandhi anya anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan jeevashm karte rahe hai
 Paleontology is divided into several branches
 suvidha kii drushti se ab yah niyam sa ban gaya he ki jab ham 'jeevashmiki' shabd kaa upyog karte hai tab hamaara abhipraay keval aksheruki jeevon ke jeevashmon ke adhyayan se hota he
 The branch of paleontology under which vertebrate fossils are studied is called vertebrate paleontology
 padap jeevashmon kaa adhyayan ek bhinn shakha ke antargat kiya jaataa he jise padpashm vigyaan kehete hai
 In modern times, some other major branches of paleontology have also developed, whose fields of study are very small organisms and fossil humans respectively
 jeevashmiki kaa kshetra bada vyapak he or uski seemaa nishchit rup se nirdhaarit nahin kii ja sakati
 If viewed theoretically, the emergence of fossilism begins with the evolution of an organism on Earth, but on geological grounds it can only be said that half of the history of the entire organism on Earth, or even less, We find the records of creatures
 jeevashm vaigyanik anveshanon kaa prarambhkaal aise pracheenatam prapya jeevashmon se kiya ja saktaa he jinke jaivik gun jaivikeey aadhaar par batalaaye ja sakate hai
 Paleontology has a very close relationship with geology, especially layered-rock-geology
 ateet kaal ke jeevon ke avshesh starit shailon main paae jate hai
 The fossils found in them have been very helpful in the construction of these rocks and in establishing their sequence
 vastav main bina jeevashmon ke starit-shail-bhoumiki, ek prakaar se, vyaavhaarik jeevashmiki he
 Paleontology has a close relationship with biology
 jaiviki ke antargat vartmaan jivit praaniyon or padpon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, jab ki jeevashmiki main bhoumikeey yugon ke un jeevon or padpon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he jo kabhi jivit the or ab jeevashm ke rup main hi prapya hai
 But paleontology cannot be considered a branch of biology, as the material of the study of paleontology and the manner of its collection are completely different from the material of the study of biology and the manner of its collection
 yah nishchit karnaa ki kis sthaan par jeevashmiki ko jaiviki se pruthak kiya ja saktaa he, praaia: asambhav sa he
 But roughly the end of fossils and the beginning of biology can be traced back to the Sandhisthana of the ultra-new age and modern era
 is prakaar se anishchit or sandigdh cambrian-purv mahakalp praani evam padapjaat tathaa vartmaan kaal ke nishchit tathaa anek prakaar ke jeevon or padpon ke bich main anek tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke jeev avshesh milte hai, jo jeev par prakaash daalate hai
 These fossils found in the sedimentary rocks of Bhuparpti are the basis of the study of paleontology
 jeevigyaani jeevashmiki main isliye atyadhik abhiruchi rakhte hai ki iskaa jeevvikas jaise vishay se nikat sambandh he
 The history or species of species of animals and plants can be traced more confidently based on the study of fossils derived from the sequenced levels of layered rocks
 parantu jeevon ke apurna abhilekh ke kaaran unke jativrutt ke anurekhan main atyadhik baadha padati he, kyonki bhoumikeey yugon main paae janevaale praaniyon or padpon main se kuch hi or unamem se adhikansh apurna dasha main, in shailon main parilakshith paae jate hai
 In spite of this incompleteness of the inscription, in many organisms, when they are traced from one level to the other, the changes take place
 jab jeevashmon ke praturup vibhinn anukramit staron se ekatrit kiye jate hai, tab pratyaksh rup se do bhinn dikhaai padanevaali jatiyaan bich ke jeevashmon dwaara sambandhit dikhaai padati hai or nimnatam str main pai janevaali jati se lekar ucchtam str main milanevaali jati tak ke bichwaale staron ke jeevashmon ke jeevon main hue parivartanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 In addition to the standard method, comparative methods of body and personality can also be used to detect caste from fossils

 There is also evidence to suggest that the evolution of organism was evolutionary

 Tracing the complete stages of development from the unicellular egg of the living plants and animals to the final stage, is subject to geology and organism

 This fact has revealed excessive fraternity in shapes that are highly different from one another in adulthood

 The results of these embryological explorations have a special relationship with paleontology
 aise anek jeevashm jaankaree main hai jo apane main apane se sambandhit aadhunik jeevon kii tulana main bhruneey, athwa kam se kam dimbhiy, athwa kishoravasa ke lakshan dikhaate hai
 Examples of this type of primitive embryonic types are found especially in vertebrates, as skeletons become obscured during the very early period of life

 Giving definite names to fossils is important to the paleontologist so that he can distinguish more accurately among fossils
 jeevashmon kaa namakaran saamanyat: unheen siddhanton par aadhaarit he jinpar praaniyon kaa
 Pranijagat is divided into many sanghas and each sangha is divided into several classes, gana, clans, clans and castes
 jeevashmon ke kai prakaar ke praroop hote hai
 If the investigator describes an entire caste on the basis of a model of a fossil of that caste, then that fossil model is called the name of that caste
 yadi kisi ek ke namprarup kaa nishchay karne main anveshak anya jeevashm namoonon kii sahaayta letaa he, to in atirikt namoonon ko paratip kehete hai
 If the investigator takes the help of many other fossil specimens without deciding the name, then these fossil specimens are called Sahuparup
 yadi kisi jati ke jeevashm kaa sahpraroop us jati ke praarambhik varnan ke pashchaat kii us jati kaa praaroop chun jaataa he, to vah jeevashm praroop lactotip kehalaata he
 Just as there are fossil specimens to describe a caste, similarly there are caste or homogeneous fossils to describe a lineage
 yadi koi anveshak kisi ek nae vansh kaa varnan kisi ek vishesh jati ke aadhaar par karata he, to vah jati us vansh ke liye jenoholotip ho jaati he
 If the investigator gives a list of such castes in the description of the new dynasty that he considers to be under the new lineage, then all these species are called genocyntypes

 The geological period is divided into five major parts
 ye kramash: nimnlikhit hai- Archaeozoic Mahakalp is the oldest among them
 bhoumikeey kaal ke in paanch mahakalpon main vibhaajan mukhyat: in mahakalpon main milanevaale praaniyon or padpon ke jeevashmon par hi aadhaarit he
 Of these, the Archeozoic Great Canyon was fauna
 is mahakalp main na kisi prakaar ke jeevajantu or na paudhe hi the
 Therefore, we do not find any fossils in the rocks of this period
 pragjeev mahakalp main protozoa jaise ati saadhaaran prakaar ke jeevajantu astitv main aae
 But due to the lack of any tough part in these ordinary organisms, they could not be preserved in the rocks
 at: pragjeev mahakalp ke shailon main bhi jeevashm nahin milte
 The other three Mahakalpas, namely, the Puranjeevi Mahakalpa, the Madhyamajeeva Mahakalpa and the Nutanjeevi Mahakalpa are fossiliferous
 in mahakalpon ke antargat aanevaale jitne bhi chote se lekar bade tak vibhaajan hai ve sab purnat: us kaal main paae janevaale jeevon ke jeevashm par hi aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, we see that the work of layered paleontologists cannot run without the help of paleontology
 yahi kaaran he ki jeevashm vigyaan starit shailavigyaan kaa merudand kehalaata he
 On the basis of paleontology broadly, the following four main animal and plant ethnic superpowers can be established: purv purajivi mahakalp - iske antargat cambrian, ordovishan or silyurian kalp aate hai
 Answer: The archaeological Mahakalpa - Dioni, Carboni and Permian Kalpa are covered under it
 madhyajivi mahakalp Nutanjeev Mahakalpa - Abhinav Kaal is also under it
 praaia: sab pramukh aksheruki praaniyon ke pratinidhi jeevashm cambrin staron main paae jate hai or unamem se trilobite jaise kuch praani adicrambrian kaal main hi apekshaya adhik viksit ho chuke the
 Hence the assumption that the ancestors of all classes found in the Cambrian strata were found in the pre-cambrian period, although their remains are not found in the Cambrian pre-shales
 yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki cambrionpurv samudron main sab prakaar ke praani rahete the, parantu ve sab komalangi purvaj the, jinhone apane astitv ke vishay main kisi bhi prakaar ke chihr nahin chhoden hai
 Since all types of animals are directly or indirectly dependent on plants, and plants only have the power to process inorganic foods, it also seems reasonable to assume that plants existed in the pre-cambrian period
 parantu yah aashcharya kii baat he ki paudhon ke avshesh purajivi mahakalp ke staron main nahin paae gaye hai
 Following is a brief description of the main characteristics of the zoological world of the predecessor Mahakalpa: yah matsay or parnang samaan sthal padpon kaa, jinhen terridosperms kehete hai, yug tha
 Along with these were found goniotites, spiriferid bahupad and rugos coral
 madhyajivi mahakalp sarisrupon or amonites kaa kalp kehalaata he
 Along with them, rinconilids and corals were also prominent in the Belemnites Brachiopoda
 yah kalp staniyon, pakshiyon, foraminipheron or aavrutabiji padpon kaa kaal tha
 On the basis of animals and plants, we cannot separate the new life cycle from modern times
 sampurna shailon ke anukram kaa kram bhalee bhanti nishchay ho jane or unamem paae janevaale jeevashmon kii pahchaan ho jane ke uparaant yah pataa chalaa ki jeevon ke vikaas main shanai:-shanai: pragati hui
 The most common types of organisms first appeared, which are found in the oldest sedimentary rocks, and after that the complex organisms gradually came to the Tarunatar rocks
 is prakaar sampurna aksheruki sanghon ke pratinidhi, jo jeevashm rup main parirakshan yogya hai, cambrian shailon main milte hai, parantu prayek sangh ke antargat paae janevaale jeev apni rachana main praaia: samaan the or bahut kam parivartan dikhaate the
 On morphological basis, we may call them underdeveloped lineages, but in later ages the composition of organisms found in each association was more varied and this fact is confirmed to some extent by the increase in the number of lineages
 kasherukiyon main rachana ke aadhaar par aadim varg samajha janevaala cychlosotomata varg he, jiskaa sabase pehle pradurbhaav hua or jiske uparaant kramash: matsay, ubhaychar, sarisrup, pakshi or stani aae or ye varg usee kram se prakat hote gaye jaisaa unki rachana se aashaa kii jaati thi
 Thus, the order of acquisition of organisms in the geological ages proves the truth of the theory of biology, because the older the shells are, the simpler their living remains are and as such the study of the nearest rocks according to the geological time table Such complex organism remains are found

 All the material on which the history of horse development is based is derived from tertiary rocks of North America

 The horse of the Middle Eocene is known as Orohippus, which was only slightly larger than Eohippus in size

 The horse, popularly known as Mesohippus, is found in the lower and middle Oligocene rocks
 yah aakaar main bhed ke baraabar, yaa usase kuch chota, tha
 Myohypus, which was found in the later Oligocene and lower Myocene eras, was only slightly larger than sheep

 The horse of the Middle Myocene was called Mericippes

 The Pleocene era horse, Plyohippus, was equivalent in size to a donkey, but the tertiary era was equivalent to a horse found in the present period
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki ghode ke aakar main dhire-dhire vruddhi hui
 Similarly, changes in the internal structure of horse's arms and legs increased its speed

 Similarly, everything other than the bone between the wrists was depleted, which made the wrist firm

 Similarly, the head and cervix grew slowly, allowing the horse to graze easily

 Tarzan is a character created by Edgar Rice Burrows, first seen in the novel Tarzan of the Apes and then in 25 sequels, in three authoritative books by other authors, and in numerous authorized or unauthorized works of media Was also seen in tarjan ek british sardaar or unki patni kaa betaa he jinhen vidrohiyon ke dwaara africa ke pashchimi tat par bhej diya gaya
 When Tarzan was one year old, his mother died of natural causes and his father was killed by the leader of the Vanar tribe, Karchak, the same tribe in which Tarzan was adopted
 tarzan kii vanar janajati ko mangani ke naam se janaa jaataa he, ek prajati ke mahaan vanar jo vigyaan ke liye agyaat hai
 Kala is his monkey mother
 tarzan uskaa vanar naam he; uskaa angreji naam jon clayton, lord grestoke he
 In fact, Burrows, as the author of Tarzan of the Apes, describes both Clayton and Greystoke by fictitious names — implying that the fictional world in which Tarzan lives may have a different real name
 ek yuva vyask ke rup main, tarzan ek yuva america mahila jine porter se miltaa he, jise use uske pita or uske dal ke kai logon ke saath africa ke tat par thik usee jagah par bhej diya jaataa he jahaan 20 saal pehle tarzan ke mata pita ko bhej diya gaya tha

 In Tarzan, Burrows presents an extreme example of a protagonist's character; He is Caucasian, very athletic, tall, beautiful and dark, his eyes are gray and his hair is black
 bhaavnaatmak rup se, vah saahsee, vafaadaar or sthir pravriti kaa he
 He is intelligent and learns new languages easily
 kam se kam baroj kii paribhaashaon ke dwaara use is tarah se prastut kiya gaya he ki vah naitiktapurna vyavhaar karata he, parantu kuch vishesh sthitiyon main vah bahut dukhi ho jaataa he, jaise jab tarzan of da eps main uski vanar maa kaala kii hatya kar di jaati he, yaa jab tarzan da antemd main use pataa chalata he ki jine kii hatya kar di gayi he
 He loves his wife very much and is completely devoted to her; In many situations where other women express their attraction to him, Tarzan ignores them politely but not with firmness
 jab kabhi kisi kamazor vyakti yaa dal par kisi shaktishaalee dushman ke dwaara waar kiya jaataa he, to tarzan hameshaa kamazor dal kaa paksh letaa he
 Tarzan is very strong and strong in dealing with other men
 purush mitron ke saath vah kam baatcheet karata he, unase sankoch karata he, parantu bahut adhik vafaadaar or udaar he
 He is equally generous and kind as a host
 ek netaa ke rup main vah puri vafadari or samarpan kii bhaavana ke saath aadesh detaa he
 In contrast to these great features, Tarzan's philosophy embraces the extreme form of "returning to nature"
 haalanki vah ek sabhy naagarik ke tarah samaaj main rah saktaa he, phir bhi vah "saamaajik jivan se dur janaa" pasand karata he, jaisaa ki baroj ne aksar darshaya he
 Knives and lion skins are his favorite outfit, his favorite place of residence is a cozy tree branch, resting there when he wants to sleep, raw meat is his favorite food, which he himself kills; Even he sometimes suppresses this meat in the soil for a week so that the process of decomposition makes it soft
 tarzan ke adivasee darshan ko asankhya prashansakon ke dwaara pasand kiya gaya he, jine gudal inamen se ek hai, jo bataati hai ki tarzan siries ne unke bachapan ko bahut adhik prabhavit kiya he
 He says that she thinks she would have been a better life partner than Tarzan's fictional wife, Jane, and when she first started living and studying among the chimpanzees, she lived among great apes like Tarzan
 Was fulfilling her childhood dream
 rudyard kipoling ke mughali ne tarzan ke nirmaan ke liye edgar rayees baroj ko bahut adhik prabhavit kiya he
 Mowgli is also an influence of many other "wild boys" characters

 He learns a new language in a few days, so speaks many languages, it includes the languages of great apes, French, English, Dutch, German, Swahili, many Bantu dialects, ancient Greek, ancient Latin, Mayan and ant man languages and Language of pellucidar is included
 vah junglee jaanwaron kii kai prajatiyon ke saath bhi baatcheet karata he
 Tarzan is regarded as one of the best literary characters in the world

 In addition, Farmer's a Feast Unknown, and its two sequel Lords of the Trees and The Made Goblin, recounts Tarzan's past and are Doke Savage stories, telling stories of the "real" characters on which the fictional characters are based

 While another Tarzan of the Apes has met with critical success, the subsequent books in the series were better welcomed and also criticized for being derivative and formulaic
 paatro ko aksar dwi-aiami bataaya gaya he, inke samvaad or kahani bataane vaale upkarnon par kahin na kahin tanaav bana hua he
 According to author Rudyard Kipling, Burrows wrote Tarzan of the Apes only to "find out how bad a book he can write and how far he can go with it
" halanki baroj ek manje hue upanyaaskaar nahin hai, ve ek jwalanth kahanikar hai or unke kai upanyaas abhi bhi chap rahen hai
 In 1963, writer Gore Vidal wrote on the Tarzan series that, while pointing to the work of literature such as the many shortcomings found in the Tarzan books, he praised Edgar Rice Burrows, because he "made this daylike dream figure"
 Is depicted live

 Burroughs's state of theatricality in his fictional world and detailed descriptions of his work, such as the making of partial language for his great apes, draw fans to him
 jis samay main tarzan kii pustakon or filmon ko likhaa gaya, ve ek saamaanya ansh tak vyapak roodhiwaadita ko darshaati hai
 This gave rise to criticism in later years, with which social ideas and practices changed, including racism since the 1970s

 In The Return of Tarzan, the Arabs appear "scandalous" and call Christians a "dog", while black people are "resilient bodies, warriors, gestures and bullshit
" " koi isi tarah kaa tark de saktaa he ki kaale logon ke liye baroj saadhaaran rup se bekaar patron kaa chithran kar rah tha or "tarzan and da jwels of oper" ke adhyay 6 main achche paatro kaa vivaran diya gaya, jahaan baroj mumbai main likhte hai, " xxrep 7

 However, Burrows never loses distaste in European grandeur
 baroj kii raay, kahaniyon kii kathatmak aawaaj main abhivyakt hoti he, jo unke samay ke saamaanya vyavhaar ko pratibimbit karti he, jo 21 veen sadi sandarbh main jatvaad or sabase zyada sexit mana jayega
 However Thomas F
 Bartonew writes of Burrows "the feminist concept that elevates women to the level of men and — characters that appear in the deranged stories of Barsom novels or in novels — expresses the feminine type that a housewife Desperate as he is, he is neither a middle-level careerist office manager, nor an ideal professor, but who in his real humanity Crosses all boundaries and advises her faded in doing so
 " The author is not particularly enthusiastic in his approach

 bedermen ke anusaar tarzan, "ek vibhedit rup se rajput angreji" he, jo langik hinsa main lipt nahin he, "balaatkaar karne ke maradaana aaveg" kaa tyaag karata he
 However, she also notes that Tarzan not only kills the black male Kulonga to avenge the murder of his monkey mother, but also hangs him, "linchar Tarzan really enjoys killing black people , For example the cannibal Mbongan
 In fact, Bederman reminds readers that when Tarzan first introduces himself to Jane by calling him "tarzan" and calling himself a wild Anvron and tells many black men of the killer
 " In the novel's climax, Tarzan rescues Jane — who is not British in the original novel but a white woman from Baltimore, Maryland — from a black apes rapist

 After Baroz's death, many writers created new Tarzan stories without his estate's permission
 kuch udaahranon main, aise anaadhikrut kaam ke prakaashan par estate ke dwaara roak laga di gayi
 The most notable exception to this was the result of five novels by the pseudonym "breton Varper" in the United States, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc
 a legal action was taken by the latter, after which they were removed from the market and the remaining copies were destroyed
 isi tarah kii series anya deshon main bhi saamne ai, inamen mukhya the argentina, israel or kuch arab desh
 Israel became a local industry in the 1950s and early 1960s in which Tarzan's adventure was published weekly in a 24-page booklet by several competing publishing houses, either of them from the Burrows estate
 Taking official permission was not considered appropriate
 In stories based on Tarzan in contemporary Africa, his battle with Mau Mau has been a popular subject in 1950s Kenya and at times he crushes his rebel with one hand

 These brochures on Tarzan were very popular among Israeli youth in their time, with the numerous hebrew translations of the original Tarzan novels, the influence of the brochure on Tarzan began to diminish in the mid-1960s, with copies now available in the market
 Books used in Israel are sold at high prices in the market

 The pore hole, a type of orifice resonator, consists of a coherent beam of light between the reflective surfaces so that the light gains pass through the medium more than once before the output is emitted from the orifice or lost in refraction or absorption
 The medium passes through the cavity, if the gain in the medium is stronger than the loss in resonance, the power of this diffuse light तीव्र There is a rapid increase
 But every induced emission event shifts the particle from the excited state to the cool state while decreasing the capacity of the gain medium for further amplification
 When this effect becomes stronger, the gain is assumed to be full
 Is
 The gain creates a balance between the balance of the pump power against the saturated and the reduced power present in the hole through the depletion of the hole; This balance establishes a center of laser power
 yadi chuni gai pump shkt bahut choti he, to pratidhwani ghate se ubarne main laabh paryaapt nahin hoga or lager bahut kam prakaash shakt utsarjit karegaa
 The minimum power required to initiate laser action is called the initial limit for laser emitting

 If the beam is not of a low-level Gaussian shape, the transverse method of light can be interpreted as the hermite-gaussian or laguerre-gaussian beam of extreme state
 Can be described
 On the other hand, unsteady resonance lasers reflect the output of the size of the pieces
 yah kiran ucch str kasanghanik ho saktaa he, yah bina jhukaav ke samanaantar hota he
 However, due to an absolutely condensed ray refraction, it cannot be created
 This ray is condensed to a distance that varies according to the square of the diameter of the beam and which is finally bent at an angle that is opposite to the diameter of the beam
 Thus, light produced by a small laser laboratory, such as a helium-neon laser, spreads to a diameter of 1
6 km if the Earth is lunar As shown, in comparison, the product of a typical semiconductor laser, due to its small diameter, tends to tilt as soon as it exits the hole, at any angle up to 50 °
 However, this Such tilted rays can be converted into condensed rays through a lens
 Conversely, rays from nonlaser light sources cannot also be carried by condensed optics

 These pulses are separated primarily in time such that a pulsing resonator completes a round circle in the orifice
 The Fourier limit
 Also known as the cause of), a pulsation of such short length consists of a beam that covers a wide range of wavelengths
 Because of this, there should be a substantial benefit profile of the laser medium in order to amplify all of them
