 Rajasthan Maharasthana Foundation of Jodhpur has published this Maharana in 4 volumes under the editing of Lakshminarayan Goswami

 Handwritten copies of some of his compositions are also in the Pothikhana of Jaipur as mentioned in this list
 yadhyapi prakaash parimal jaise anusandhankartaaon ne shivanand ji kaa janm vikram samvath 1710 ankit kiya he, tathaapi unki laghu-pustak main is tathy ke sakshya kaa koi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 The truth is that in which year and where he was born, it is a matter of research
 is kaa kaaran keval yah he ki puraane jamaane main mahaan se mahaan lekhak tak apane nijee-jivan ke bare main koi soochna yaa jaankaree apni kritiyon main aksar nahin dete the
 In that era, to remain completely secret or unaware and to engage in high level silent saraswat-sadhana would have been the internal psychopathy of many scholars like Shivanand ji
 aisa anumaan bahuprachlit he ki anek nareshon ke sammanit kulguru hone ke baavjood, apana antim samay goswamiji ne bikaner ke maharaja anupasingh ke aagrah par unke saath hi vyateet kiya
 But where Shivanand Goswami died - somewhere in South India, or in Bikaner - is a matter of research
 shivanand goswami chanderi ke governor devisingh bundela ke samakaleen the, jinhone goswamiji se 'mantra-diksha' lekar bhent main kuch gaanvon kii jaagir bakshi thi
 Similarly, the seventh generation king of Orchha, Devi Singh, was impressed by his scholarship and gave a jagir of 4 villages
 jaipur raja vishnusingh ne san 1692-1694 isvi main inhen ramjipura, harivanshpura, chimanpura or mahapura graamon kii jaagir bhent kii thi, jiskaa pramaan jaipur ke pothikhana ke abhilekh main aaj bhi surakshit he
 Today Mahapura village has become a part of the Jaipur metropolis, which is situated on Ajmer road, 10 km from Jaipur
 mahapura main goswami ji ke or unke bhai janardan goswami ke vanshaj pidiyon tak nivas karte rahe
 It was here that in 1922, the famous Sanskrit litterateur Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri was married to Ramadevi Bhatt, the daughter of Acharya Gopikrishna Goswami of Srimad Bhagwat, a descendant of Shivanandji
 bikaner ke maharaja anup singh dwaara goswamiji ko do gaanvon - pulasar or chilkoi kii jaagir bhent kii gai thi
 He stayed in Bikaner in the evening of his life
 sambhawatah inkaa dehavsaan bhi vahiin hua ho- kintu inke antim dinon ke bare main koi aitihaasik saamagree uplabdh nahin hoti| After Shivanand ji, his sons also continued to achieve many achievements in royalty, keeping their clan tradition intact, as evidenced by the following English document- 'maharaj shri Shivanandji, sole ascendant, gave purnabhishek-mantra to Maharaja Shri Anoop Singh ji Bahadur of Bikaner at Dilsuri 
 The Maharaja bequeathed two villages CHIKLOI and POOLASAR in Bhent on this most auspicious occasion to Shri Shivanandji Maharaj, the Rajguru
 Thus Goswami Paramsukhji Maharaj, the youngest son of great Shri Shivanandji Maharaj settled at Bikaner on the request of HH Shri Gajsingh ji Bahadur,the Maharaja of Bikaner
 Shri Suratsinghji, Maharaja of Bikaner also accepted Purnabhishek Mantra from Goswami Shri Paramsukhji Maharaj, the Rajguru, in 1855 AD and bequeathed the village KHETOLAI in Bhent and bequeathed on the most auspicious occasion of the sacred thread ceremony of Bishwnathji and kanhaiyalalji, real sons of shri Paramsukhji Goswami, village SURJANSAR devisingh ke darbari vidvan unke viruddh anek prakaar ke pravaad unki anupasthiti main bana kar raja ke kaan bharte rahete the| yah baat to sarvavidit thi ki orchha yaa bundelon ke isht devtaa, bhagwaan ram the or isi kaaran is kshetra main anek ram or hanuman mandiron kii sthapana bhi hui he, vaise orchha main hi bundelon ke isht hanumanji kaa ek mandir aaj bhi he| yah mandir shivanandji ke ashram or devisingh ke mehalon ke bich padataa tha
 The scholars of Shivanand complained to the king that the temple of the presiding deity of Bundelkhand, while on the way, never bowed down to his guru, the presiding deity
 When King Devisingh himself presented the same thing in front of them, he avoided it in humor, saying that "this matter is of personal reverence and since i am absorbed in the feeling of Ahornish Devi, therefore going into the 'other' sense in it Mine and yours will be evil! All gods are the form of God anyway
 

 " inke uttar se raja kadaachit puri tarah santusht nahin ho sakaa
 So once both of them were coming through the path of the same Hanuman temple, the king begged them to bow down to their favorite Hanuman
 kehete hai- jaise hi shakti ke param aradhak shivanandji ne apane haath pranaam hetu uthaae, usase purv hi hanumanji kii murti main pathar fatne kii awaz ke saath upar se neeche tak ek gahari daraar pads gayi! raja is chamatkaar se bahut bhaybheet ho gaya
 And since then, a deep loyalty to Adyashakti has also awakened in his mind
 orchha main hanuman mandir main aaj bhi vah gahari daraar dekhi ja sakati he
 


 After this incident, Shivanand Goswami's mind became somewhat unsympathetic to the learned politicians and devout politicians in the court on the strength of miracles
 unhone "sankshep-praayshchitt" or "vyavhaar-nirnay" jaise granth likh kar apane isht ke samaksh praayshchitt kiya
 


 " aurangzeb shashan ke dauraan amer ke rajya par aaye rajnatik-sankaton ke nivaaran ke liye jaipur ke tatkaaleen panditon ne maharaja vishnusingh ko nagar main shanti banaaye rakhane ke liye 'vaajapeya-yajna' karwaane kaa mashvira diya tha
 Then some pandits of Kashi and Mithila were very famous for their cultivation and siddhis
 amer ke naresh ne unhen hi is kaam ke liye jaipur aamantrit kiya
 But whenever there was a veela of Purnahuti in that royal Vajpayee-yajna due to misuse, the sacrificial priest would die accidentally
 This happened many times, not once
 ek ke baad ek kaashi-mithila ke paanch siddh purohit yajna puraa karaane se purv hi kaal-kavlit ho gaye
 Seeing such a terrible vengeance, the king sent a message through Bikaner King Anupsinh to Orchha Maharaj that he should kindly send his vice-chancellor and the great Tantric Shivanandji to Jaipur so that he can get the vajpayee-yajna done
 Shivanand Goswami finally reached Amer in 1680 AD and near the Jalmahal, he completed the vajpayee-yajna of Jaipur King uninterrupted
 The night before Purnahuti, it is said that a formidable Brahmarakshas appeared before Goswamiji in a dream - who challenged him to debate with the information that the earlier five kashi-pandits had become his grasps by defeating him in debate
 goswamiji ne brahmarakshas kii is chunauti ko sweekaar kiya or use shastrarth main haraa kar vaajapeya-yajna purnahuti ke saath vidhivat sampann karaayaa| But to disguise the fact that the first five kashi-pandits had defeated the Brahmarakshas in scripture and become his morsels, the king returned to Mahapura from Amber without any alms from Amber Maharaja
 It is said that when Maharaja Vishnusinh sensed Shivanandji's displeasure, he persuaded himself to reach Mahapura with his son Sawai Jai Singh
 Shivanandji, while making some very accurate predictions about Sawai Jai Singh, instructed the Maharaja that he go to some well-known ritualist Pandit and send Kashi for the 'pratamukti' of Brahmarakshas
 He somewhat unhappily held the Maharaja responsible for the killing of the five Pandits, He would have been advised to get Ashwamedha Yagya done as a result of citing many ancient scriptures
 Being distressed by the death of innocent Brahmins, he also showed humility in front of Maharaja in Mahapura and reluctance to stay
 Goswamiji eventually left the estate of five villages with his younger brother to Maharaja Anoop Singh as the Rajguru of Bikaner "after some time" - whose invitation / request to be Bikaner vice-chancellor-rajguru has been pending with him ever since

 isamen bas nirmaataa dwaara prastaavit keemat shaamil he or ise aam taur par nirmaataa dwaara utpaada par mudrit kiya jaataa he
 In Western countries, the retail price is often called the psychological price or the odd price
 adhiktar, mulya nishchit hote hai or chinhon tathaa labalon par prardashit hote hai
 Alternatively, price discrimination may occur when prices are not clearly displayed, where the selling price depends on who the customer is
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek graahak ko adhik bhugtan karnaa pad saktaa he agar vikreta yah nirdhaarit karata he ki vah taiyaar he or / yaa sakasham he
 Another example is the practice of waiver for youth or students
 aise kai tareeke hai jinke dwaara upabhokta ek khudara vikreta se maal praapt kar sakate hai: Some shops sell second hand goods
 gaiyr-munafa dukaan ke maamle main, janata bikri ke liye dukaan ko daan main maal detii he
 Items can be found for free in the free-shop
 doosraa rup he girvee kii dukaan, jahaan aise maal beche jate hai jinhen rin ke liye samparshvik rup main istemaal kiya gaya he
 "there are also consignment shops, which are such where a person keeps an item and if he sells, the person pays the shop owner some percentage of the selling price
 is tarah saamaan bechney kaa laabh yah he ki sthapit dukaan adhik sambhavit khariddaaron ke liye vastu ko pradarshit karti he
 Behind the scenes in retail, another aspect works there
 nigam or swatantra store maalik, samaan rup se hameshaa apane pratidwandviyon par badhat paane kii koshish karte rahete hai
 One way to do this is to hire a buy-sell solution company that specifically designs shop performance to attract more customers from a particular segment
 The largest retailers in the country spend millions of rupees every year on an in-store marketing program which varies according to seasonal and promotion period changes
 jaise-jaise utpaada badalte hai, vaise-vaise khudara paridrishy bhi
 khudara vikreta, puri tarah se vastuon se bhari hui dukaan kaa swaroop dene ke liye fecing takanic kaa bhi upyog kar sakate hai, jab vastav main aisa na ho
 a destination shop is one where customers are particularly ready to go, sometimes over a large area
 These stores are often used to "anchor" a shopping mall or plaza, generating a walkthrough, which is redeemed by smaller retailers
 "discovery-besd retail" kitaab ke anusaar upabhokta seva "un kriyaaon or tatwon kaa yoga he jo upabhoktaaon ko aapke khudara anushthan se apni jarurat yaa ichha kii vastuon ko praapt karne kii anumati dete hai
 " khudara bikri kii report har maheene prakashit hoti he
 It is a measure of consumer spending, an important indicator of US GDP
 retail companiyaan dollar mulya par apni khudara bikri or maal ke aankade pradaan karti hai
 12000 companies in the final survey and 5000 in the next
 Pre-estimated figures are based on sub-samples from the US CB full retail and food service

 dhvanyatmak lipyantaran masini lipyantaran kii ek vidhi he
 This is a transliteration method whereby Indian scripts such as Hindi are interchanged and converted into Roman
 dhvanyatmak lipyantaran kaa ek mukhya prayog indic typing vidhi ke rup main he
 The user types Hindi text in Roman script and it is phonetically converted to equivalent Devanagari in real time
 is prakaar kaa swachaalit parivartan dhvanyatmak taxt ctitor, verde prosesar tathaa software plagain ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 But the best approach is the use of phonetic IME, with the help of which text can be written directly to any application
 phonetic transilitration aadhaarit ikhmai ke udhaaharan hai baraa ikhmai, indic ikhmai, google indic lipyantaran aadi
 These are mainly of two types: - is prakaar ke aujaar ek nishchit lipyantaran skim ke aadhaar par taxt ko bhartiya lipi main badalte he
 Examples of this type of typing tools are - Indic IME, Barah IME etc
 is tarah ke aujaar pehle roman main tip kiye gayi shabd ko ek shabdkosh ke saath tulana karte hai or phir use samakaksh hindi shabd main badalte hai
 Such tools are equipped with artificial intelligence and choose the most appropriate word by itself
 kisi vishesh skim se bandhe na hone ke kaaran ye romanagari ke abhyaston ke liye tathaa jo ki pehali baar athwa shuru main hindi tip kar rahe hon, sarvaadhik saral evam upyukt hote hai
 The first dictionary-based phonetic transliteration tool was created by Quilpad, later Google and Microsoft also created such tools

 sangutica do yaa usase adhik nigamon kaa ek sangyojan he jo ek hi karporate sanrachana ke antargat, aksar ek pareint company or vibhinn adhinsth companiyon ko shaamil karti hui, puri tarah se bhinn vyapaar main salagn hoti hai
 Often the conglomerate is a multi-industrial company
 sangutica aksar badi or bahurashtriya hoti he
 The conglomerate was popular in the 1960s because of the low interest rate and the recurring beer / bull market, which gave companies the opportunity to buy at a profit, sometimes even at a temporarily reduced rate
 Famous examples from the 1960s include ling-temco-watt, IIT Corporation, Litton Industries, Textron, Talladian, Gulf and Western Industries, and Transamerica
 jab tak lakshya company ke paas rin par byaaj kii tulana main adhik laabh hota he, sangutica kaa nivesh par pratifal vikaas karata hua dikhataa he
 In addition, conglomerates have greater ability to borrow from the money market or capital market than their community bank small firm
 kai saalon ke liye yah company ke share mulya main vruddhi karne ke liye paryaapt tha, kyonki companiyaan praaia: vidhik rup se apane aaroai ko mahatv detii thim
 The aggressive attitude of the conglomerates themselves led investors to buy shares, which saw a powerful and manifestly unstoppable force in the business
 High share prices, based on their stock prices, prompted them to raise more debt and led to the purchase of more companies
 This gave direction to a chain reaction, which motivated them to move faster
 haalanki, yah vikaas kuch had tak bhraamak tha
 As soon as the interest rate began to rise to meet the inflation deficit, the conglomerates lost profits
 niveshkon ne bhi dekha ki samooh ke andar companiyaan utani teji se nahin bad rahi thi jaisaa ki kharidne ke pehle hota tha, jabaki company ko kharidne ke peeche yah tark tha ki sahakriyata unhen adhik kaarykushalta kii ore le jaaegi
 1960 ke uttarardh tak ve bazaar ke dabaav main thi or unhone ipane sheyaron ko vyapak taur par bechaa
 To keep the companies running, the conglomerates were forced to sell the newly purchased companies and by the mid-1970s, most of them had collapsed
 The craze of the conglomerate later shifted to a relatively new idea, such as the company's core competency
 anya maamalon main, sangutica kaa nirmaan vividhikaran ke vaastavik hiton ke liye kiya gaya tha banisbat kaagaj ke upar aaroai ke uparokt herpher ke abhivinyas yukt company keval uparjan kar sakati hai, yaa anya sectoron main nai shakhaaen chaalu kar sakati hai jab unhe yah vishwaas ho ki isse laabh yaa sthirataa main badhotaree hogi

 GE also owns most of nbcuniversal, which holds rights over the NBC television network and various cable networks
 kuch myanon main, jeei 1960 ke dashak ke tipical sangutikaaon se is myne main alag he ki company ucch str kii laabhakaari nahin thi or jab byaaj dar bad gaya, unhone ise apane laabh ke liye istemaal kiya, maano rin kaa upyog kar nae upaskar khareednaa jeei se lij lene kii apeksha kam kharchila tha

 In Japan, a separate conglomerate model, keiretsu, developed
 While the Western model of the group is formed from a single corporation with various subsidiaries and controlled by the same corporation, Keiretsu is associated with interlocking shareholders and a central role of a bank

 Some present the low cost of conglomerate stock as evidence of these losses, while other traders believe that this trend is the market inefficiency that devalues the true strength of these stocks

 dharm kisi ek yaa adhik paralokik shakti main vishwaas or iske saath-saath uske saath judi reeti, rivaaj, parampara, puja-paddati or darshan kaa samooh he
 In this regard, Professor Mahavir Saran Jain is of the opinion that the form of religion being propagated and interpreted today needs to be avoided
 vastav main dharm sampradaay nahin he
 What we should wear in life is religion
 naitik mulyon kaa aacharan hi dharm he
 Dharma is the sacred ritual that purifies consciousness
 dharm vah tatv he jiske aacharan se vyakti apane jivan ko charitaarth kar paata he
 It is the effect of the development of human qualities in man, the determination of universal consciousness
 madhyayug main viksit dharm evam darshan ke paramparaagat swaroop evam dharanaon ke prati aaj ke vyakti kii aasthaa kam hoti ja rahi he
 The main paradigms of medieval religion and philosophy were - the imagination of heaven, the imagination of God as the doer of creation and living beings, the realization of the futility of the present life, the concept full of the illusion and illusion of our country and time
 us yug main vyakti kaa dhyaan apane shreshth aacharan, shram evam purusharth dwaara apane vartmaan jivan kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne kii ore kam tha, apane aradhy kii stuti evam jai gaan karne main adhik tha
 The lecturers of religion considered every activity in the world to be the will of God and accepted man as a puppet in the hands of God
 darshanikon ne vyakti ke vartmaan jivan kii vipannataa kaa hetu 'karm-siddhanth' ke sutara main pratipaadit kiya
 The result of this in the medieval period was that 'fate' or the will of God was accepted as the reason for all the troubles of the present
 dharm ke thekedaaron ne purusharthwaadee-maarg ke mukhya-dwaar par taala laga diya
 The destiny of society or country was accepted as its destiny
 samaaj swayan bhi bhagyavaadee banakar apni sukh-duhkhaatmak sthitiyon se santosh karata rahaa
 Today's era has provided the consciousness that we have to make the path of development ourselves
 kisi samaaj yaa desh kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karm-kaushal, vyavastha-parivartan, vaigyanik tathaa takneekee vikaas, parishram tathaa nishtha se sambhav he
 Today's man is more interested in grooming his present life
 uskaa dhyaan 'bhavishyonmukhi' na hokar vartmaan main he
 He is engaged in trying to bring the divine beings on his own earth
 vah prithvi ko hi swarg bana dene ke liye betaab he
 The Hindu religion group believes that religion is the only one in the whole world, eternal eternal Hindu religion
 brahmand kii utpatti se jo dharm chalaa aa rahaa he, usee kaa naam hindu dharm he
 Apart from this, there is only subant, religion, religion
 jain dharm bharat kaa ek dharm he
 Jainism believes that this world has been going on since time immemorial, that it will continue for eternity, which means those who have conquered themselves, ie those who have conquered the love of raga, who means those who follow them
 jin dharm kahata he bhagwaan koi alag se nahin hote varan vyakti nij shuddhatma kii sadhana se bhagwaan ban saktaa he
 God does not do anything but knows that everything happens with the rise of his actions
 jain dharm kahata he koi bandhan nahin he tum socho samajho vichaaro phir tumhen jaisaa lage vaisaa shighratisheeghra karo
 Jainism is the only religion in the world that gives freedom to a person
 jain dharm main bhagwaan ko namaskara nahin he apitu unke gunon ko namaskara he
 The religion of Islam is based on the Quran
 iske anuyaayiyon ko musalman kaha jaataa he
 Islam considers only one God, which is called Musalman Allah
 hazarat mohammad allaah ke antim or sabase mahaan sandesavahak maane jate hai
 In Islam, it is forbidden to worship gods and idols
 islam shabd arabi bhashaa kaa se uccharan he
 It means to be peaceful
 ek doosraa mana hona he-paribhaasha;vyakti ishwar kai prati samarpit hokar hi vaastavik shaanti praapt karata he|islamic vichaaron ke anusaar - ishwar dwaara pratham maanav kii rachnaakar is dharti par avatarit kiya or unheen se unka joda banaaya jisase santaanutpatti kaa kramarmbh hua, yah santannotpatti nirbaadh jari he
 God made Adam directly aware of the law to lead a life, he is pronounced by the Arabic language of the word mankind Islam
 iskaa matlab shant hona he
 a second is to be believed - definition; person attains real peace only by being devoted to God
 According to Islamic thought - God created the first human and descended on this earth and made his union with them, which led to the success of Santantupatti
 The fertility continues uninterrupted
 aadam ko ishwar ne jivan vyateet karne hetu vidhi-vidhaan se sidhe avgat kar diya, unhe maanavjaati ke pratham ishchariya doot ke pad par bhi asin kiya
 The early children of Adam were based on the fundamental principles of religion - faith in God, after death; faith in life, being in heaven, being in hell, believing in angels, believing in the scriptures, believing in the gods, punishing on the basis of karma And believed in the award, strongly believed in these fundamental principles, and also preached these basic ideas to their children, their environment, limited resources, limited languages, Nadu to transfer according to Adno
 kaalaantar main jab manushya jati kaa vistaar hota chalaa gaya or vah apni aajeevika kii khoj me, prathak-prathak evam jansamooh ke saath sudurpurv tak chaaro ore duurdur tak aabaad hote rahe
 In this way, their contact almost ceased to exist

 Thus according to their beliefs, the human race has divided into two main parts
 ek samooh ishwariya duto ke bataae hue siddanto ke dwaara apana jivan samarpit hokar sanchaalit karte

 In agriculture and animal husbandry, the use of the Green Revolution popularized traditional hybridization by making multiple layers to increase yield "high yielding varieties"
 The handful of plants and cattle breeds often hybridized in developed countries and hybridized with further localized varieties In the rest of the developing world, high-yield strains were resistant to local climates and diseases

due to complete disuse because of un-profitability and uncontrolled intentional and unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding ) formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution resulting in great loss in genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole
 A] is an organism whose gene tick content has been altered using this genetic engineering technique commonly known as recombinant DNA technique
 Genetically modified crops today are not only a common source for genetic contamination of wild varieties 
 , But also other domesticated varieties have become relatively derived from natural hybridization
 It is being said that genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution is destroying that needed unique genetic base thereby creating an unforeseen hidden crisis which will result in a severe threat to our food security for the future when diverse genetic material will cease to exist to be able to further improve or hybridize weakening food crops and livestock against more resistant diseases and climatic changes
 Conservation of this biodiversity has become a global concern

 Other major factors include neglect to improve the infrastructure of the judicial system for the past decades, extraordinary delays in filling the vacancies of judges and very low ratios between population and judges
 nyaay tantra ke kaary nishpaadan ko sudhaarney ke liye in karkon par turant dhyaan dene kii zarurat he

 Alternative dispute resolution as a dispute resolution mechanism has been very successful in the US and many other countries

 However, the absence of sufficient number of trained mediation and conciliation facilitates these measures

 All these measures need to be further strengthened and expanded, but the reforms will have to keep in mind the future requirements by implementing them as the spread of education will make more sections of society aware of their legal rights in future
 Litigation will increase further

 Despite the Code of Criminal Procedure, 2002 for bringing changes in the litigation process and civil procedure by reducing the delay in justice, the situation is still far from satisfactory

 There is a need to strengthen and modernize the police investigation mechanism which will reduce the burden on the justice system

 The success of judicial reforms will depend to a large extent on this

 They feel that in order to stop this negative trend and reverse its stance, people's trust in the judicial system must be restored immediately

 Nevertheless, effective implementation of many such recommendations is still pending
 grih mantralay kii sansadeey sthaayee samiti ke anusaar vidhi aayogon kii praaia: 50 report karyanvayan kii pratiksha main hai
 Reduced budgetary support to the judicial system has also been cited as one of the reasons for not implementing judicial reforms
 10veen panchavarshiya yojana ke dauraan nyaay tantra ke liye 700 karod rupye aavantit kiye gaye the jo kul yojana vyay 8,93,183 karod rupye kaa 0

 The allocation during the Ninth Five Year Plan was even lower, which was only 0
071 percent
 yah mana gaya he ki itnaa alp aavanton nyaay tantra kii zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke liye bhi aparyaapt he
 It is said that India spends only 0

 But lack of resources cannot be the reason for denial of justice or any other fundamental right to most citizens, especially those deprived sections who have limited access to justice due to unclear laws and high costs acting as effective deterrents

 It is the need of the hour that the Indian Union and various states understand their constitutional obligations and do some concrete work towards strengthening the justice delivery mechanism
 anya pramukh karkon main pichley dashakon se nyaay tantra ke buniyadi dhaanche main sudhaar laane kii upeksha, nyaayadhishon kii rictiyon ko bharne main asaadhaaran deree or aabaadi evam nyaayadhishon ke bich bahut nimna anupaat shaamil hai
 These factors need immediate attention to improve the performance of the judicial system
 vidhi ayog kii report main is baat kii ore sanket kiya gaya he ki bharat, duniya main aabaadi evam nyaayadhishon ke bich sabase kam anupaat vaale deshon main se ek he
 There are about 150 judges in the United States and Britain for one million people, compared to only 10 judges in India with 3 million people
 akhil bhartiya nyaayadhish sangh ke anusaar ucchtam nyaayalay ne sarkaar ko nyaayadhishon kii sankhya main 2012 tak charanbadhd dhang se vruddhi karne kaa nirdesh diya tha taaki 30 lakh kii aabaadi par 50 nyaayadhish ho jaaen, jo ab tak puraa nahin kiya gaya he
 Much more needs to be done to fill the approved vacancies of judges
 keval prakriyaagat deree ke kaaran nyaayadhishon ke 25 pratishat pad khaali pade hai
 The appointment of 886 judges was approved in the High Courts on 6 January 2009 but only 708 judges were working there, which is clear that 278 posts of judges were lying vacant
 isi prakaar, pehali march 2007 ko 11,767 adhinsth nyaayadhish kaary kar rahe the or 2710 pad rikt pade the
 However, measures have been taken in recent years to improve the functioning of the courts
 centre sarkaar ne farvari 2007 main behatar prabandhan ke liye nyaay pradaan karne ke tantra main soochna evam sanchaar praudyogiki ke anuprayog ke liye desh kii sabhi jila evam adhinsth adaalaton ke computarikaran or ucchtam nyaayalay evam ucch nyaayalayon ke soochna evam sanchaar praudyogiki ke buniyadi dhaanche ko unnat karne ke liye yojana manjuur kii thi

 Broadband connectivity has been provided in the premises of 489 district courts and 896 taluka courts
 is pariyojna ke tahat, desh main sabhi adaalat parisaron main computer kaksh sthapit kiye jane hai
 The e-enabling of the courts will help in working more efficiently and speeding up litigation
 isse ucch adaalaton ke saath in adaalaton kaa network banegaa tathaa is prakaar adhik javabdehi sunishchit hogi
 Another centrally sponsored scheme for the development of infrastructural facilities has been in operation since 1993-1994 which includes the establishment of court buildings and residential spaces for judicial officers
 is yojana ke tahat 2006-07 se 2008-09 tak rajyon ko 286 karod 19 lakh rupye jari kiye gaye hai
 The outlay for the judicial system has been sought during the 11th five-year Plan, based on a relative plan with estimates of such requirements for a period of 10 years
 is bich, ek se adhik pari main kaam karke adaalaton ke maujuuda buniyadi dhaanche ke adhiktam istemaal se mukademon ko teji se niptaya ja saktaa he
 Gujarat is a state where evening courts are functioning and giving commendable results

 In view of this, the government has extended the time period of 1,562 fast track courts operating at the session level by providing central assistance to the states
 kendriya vidhi mantralay ke anusaar, in adaalaton main 28 lakh 49 hajaar mukademen sthanantarit kiye gaye the jinamein se 21 lakh 83 hajaar kaa nipataara ho chukaa he
 The Central Government proposes to set up more than 5000 village courts at the panchayat level under the Village Courts Act, 2008 to provide justice to the rural population at its home
 in adaalaton main saral evam lacheelee prakriya apanaai jaaegi taaki in mukademon kii sunwaayee or nipataara 90 din ke bheetar kiya ja sake
 Taking recourse to alternative dispute resolution can go a long way in reducing pending cases through arbitration, negotiation, reconciliation and mediation
 america or kai anya deshon main vivaad samaadhan tantra ke rup main vaikalpik vivaad nivaaran bahut safal rahaa he
 The Arbitration Conciliation Act 1996 already exists in India and the Code of Civil Procedure has also been amended
 haalanki, paryaapt sankhya main prashikshit madhyasthata evam sulah karaane waalon ke na hone se in upayon par bura asar padataa he
 Judicial officers and lawyers need to be trained to develop alternative mechanisms in the mainstream of justice
 in sabhi upayon ko or sudrudh karne tathaa inkaa vistaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he lekin sudhaaron ko amalijama pahanaate hue bhavi aavashyaktaaon ko zahan main rakhana hoga kyonki shiksha ke prasar ke falswaroop apane kanoonee adhikaron ke bare main samaaj ke or adhik tabakon ke jaagruk hone se bhavishya main mukademebaaji or badhegi
 The government will also have to keep in mind the overall justice process that allows endless cross-examination appeals and the role of delaying lawyers to hinder the disposal of lawsuits
 nyaay main deree ko kam karne ke jariye vaad prakriya or civil prakriya main badlaav laane ke liye aapraadhik prakriya samhita, 2002 ke baavjood, sthiti ab bhi santoshjanak hone se koson dur he
 The issue of frivolous litigation will also have to be dealt with and a cost escalation can be one way
 police jaanch tantra ko majboot or aadhunik banane kii zarurat he jisase nyaay tantra par boj kam hoga
 With a holistic consideration of all the intricacies and subtle differences in the justice delivery system, it is clear that the current crisis and errors have to be considered to ensure transparency and accountability in the justice system
 yah bhi yaad rakhana hoga ki nyaay main deree, paryaapt sabooton kaa nahin hona or vaastavik jivan kii sthitiyon main sanvaidhanik evam kanoonee sidhdanton ko lagu karne main asamarthta logon ke jivan main tabaahi laate hai

 SI pranali sthir nahin rahati, varan isamen nirantar vikaas hote rahete hai, parantu ikaiyaan anterrashtriya samjhauton ke dwaara hi banaai or badali jaati hai
 The system is almost universally applicable and most countries do not even understand the official definitions of other units

 In India, this system came into force on 1 April 1957

 Other units are also used with the SI system in some scientific and cultural fields
