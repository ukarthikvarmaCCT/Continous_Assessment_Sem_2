 Bio-control is an important part of integrated pest control
 is vidhi main nashijivi va uske prakritik shatruo ke jeevanchakra, bhojan, maanav sahit anya jeevon par prabhaav aadi kaa gahan adhyayan karke prabandhan kaa nirnay liya jaataa he
 The following are the details of the natural enemies used in the control of various pests
 kiton ke niyantran ke liye prayog kiye jane vaale prakritik shatruon kii teen shreniyan hai:- Parasitic insects complete their life cycle in the bodies of other insects, resulting in the death of other insects
 yah paraseete kai prakaar ke hote he jaise: and paraseete, pupa paraseete, and sundi paraseete, vyask paraseete aadi
 Examples of these are: Trachogramma, Brecan, Katacea, Kilonas, Encarsia etc
 parabhakshi parabhakshi apane bhojan ke rup main duusare keedon kaa shikaar karte hai
 These crops eat the pests
 inke udahaaran hai: makadi, dregonfalai, demsafalai, kocasinelid bital, preingmentis, chrisoparala, sirphid, earavig, tataiya, chinteo, chidiya, pakshi, chhipakali ityadi
 Germs are micro-organisms and produce diseases in harmful insects and kill them
 rogaanuon kii pramukh shreniyan he:faphund, bacteria tathaa virus, inke atirikt kuch sutarakrimi bhi kiton main bimaariyaan utpann karke unhe maar daalate hai
 They are also called biopesticides due to their use and effect
 inke udahaaran hai: 90 percent of the insects in nature, their various stages are destroyed by the invasion of mold
 inke udahaaran hai: buveria basiana, metarigium enesapli, hiristula, varticilium linai, aadi
 Mildew attacks occur almost equally on all insects
 fafoond ke akraman se keet 10 se 15 dinon main mar jate hai
 Metarhizium enisapply, is being widely used in locust control
 buveria basiana naram sharir vaale keedo ke liye bahut prabhavi he
 Kills insects by fungal infection
 fafoond dwaara sankraman ke liye nami kaa hona aavashyak hai
 Infection is caused by contact with the body
 fafoond keedon kii sabhi avasthaaon par prabhavakaari hoti hai
 Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus papilli are effective in controlling insect control in nature
 lapedapteran kiton ke niyanntran main basilas thuringensis kaa upyog vyapak rup se kiya ja rahaa hai
 Bacteria kill insects by infection, infection is caused by diet
 prakruti main newclio palihydrosis virus or grenulosis virus naamak virus keet niyantran main prabhavakaari hai
 Viruses kill insects by infection, infection is caused by diet
 virus spisij spacific hote he
 Its special virus will be beneficial for a species
 atah virus ke prayog se pehle keedon kii sahi pahchaan haana aavashyak he
 There are three strategies of bio-control: is vidhi main prakritik shatruon ko anya sthaan se laakar akramanakari kitaa par chhodte hai
 It is brought into acid by scientific people with great care
 nashijivon ke nae sthanon par fail jane se vahaan par unke prakritik shatru maujuud nahin hote
 Scientists search for their natural enemies elsewhere in the world
 unke surikshat hone ko nishchit karte hai
 Then they are used
 is vidhi main pehle se hi maujuud prakritik shatruon kii sankhya ko is kadar badhaayaa jaataa he taaki hanikaarak keedon kii sankhya ko aarthik haani str se neeche rakh saken
 This is done by multiplying natural enemies in a large laboratory
 yah sabase mahatvapurn ranneeti he
 It is such a system in which the natural enemies that are found in nature, ie friends are given protection
 taaki unki sankhya kaa santulan hanikaarak keedon ke saath bana rahe
 It happens that the number of harmful insects in crops is much less than the number of friendly organisms / natural enemies
 yah mitra jeev / prakritik shatru hanikaarak keedon ko nasht karte rahete hai or unki sankhya ko aarthik haani str se neeche rakhane main hamaari sahaayta karte hai
 We often spray chemical insecticides only if other insects are not able to identify friendly insects and enemy insects, or in the absence of an expected invasion of enemy insects or the ratio of enemy insects and friendly insects
 Ways not successful rasinic keet naashkon kaa chhidkaav unheen paudhon yaa panktiyon par karen jahaan aakruman aarthik haani str se adhik ho
 We should constantly monitor crops, that is, we should always assess the presence and number of harmful insects, friendly organisms, diseases, weeds

 Vaidyaratnam Panniyinapalli Sankunni Varyar was the Ayurvedacharya of India
 unhone ayurvaidic chikitsa paddati ke punarjagran kaa abhiyaan chalaaya
 He gave modern, secular and scientific form of Ayurveda education and drug making
 aaj kerala kaa sabase bada brands kerala-ayurveda inhen vaidya pi
es
 variyar kii hi viraasat he
 Panniyinpalli Sankunni Warrier was born on 16 March 1869 in Kottakkal town near Calicut city, Kerala
 is parivaar ke sadasyon kii chitrakaari, sangeet va sanskrit sahitya main bahut ruchi thi
 Sankunni Warrier's mother herself was well versed in Sanskrit and classical music
 variyar parivaar ne apni pratishtha ayurvedic chikitsakon ke rup main arjeet kii thi
 The artistic, religious and medical atmosphere of his house left a lasting impression on the mind of the boy Sankunni Warrier
 variyar ne apane samay ke pratishthit vidwaanon se sanskrit sikhi
 He got his early education in Ayurveda from Konath Achutya Warrier and later got higher education in the traditional Gurukul system by staying near the then famous Ashtavadya Kuttancheri Vasudevanamus for four years
 variyar ne 20 varsh ke aayu main apni ayurveda kii shiksha purna karke jab kottakal main apana chikitsaalay armbh kiya to unhone anubhav kiya ki bharat main pashchimi chikitsa paddati bahut tezi se lokapriy hoti ja rahi thi
 Being curious, Warrior was very keen to learn about this new medical system, but ignorance of the English language was a big obstacle for Warrior
 variyar ne apni sadhano se nijee taur par angrezi siikhnaa shuru kiya or jaldi hi is bhashaa main paarangat ho gayi
 His personal interview with Western medicine was when Warrior had the opportunity to consult Dr
 V
 Varghese, assistant surgeon of a government hospital, for a problem in his eyes
 upachaar puraa hone par dow ve
 vargeez ne variyar ko pashchimi chikitsa sikhaane kii peshkash kii jise variyar ne puri kritagyata se sweekaar kiya or agle teen saal tak aspataal main prashikshan praapt kiya
 In his training, Warrior learned methods such as symptoms and diagnosis of the disease, methods for the delivery and delivery of Western medicine to patients, method of anesthesia, and minor surgery
 samakaleen vaidyon se alag hat kar allopathy chikitsa paddati kaa bhi adhyayan karke variyar ne apane gyaan main swadeshi or pashchimi pranaaliyon ko samaa liya, baavjood iske ki unki mukhya dakshata ayurveda main thi
 But Western medical knowledge, especially surgery, anatomy and physiology greatly influenced his outlook
 ek vaidya ke rup main variyar ne dekha ki unke dwaara tajaviz kii gayi ayurvaidic aushadhiyon kaa shuddh tathaa uchit anupaat main milanaa asambhav tha
 He understood that without standardization of treatment and medicines, Ayurveda system would be completely destroyed
 unhen laga ki allopathy davaayen jab niyat khuraaq or tikaoo packing main mil rahi hai or allopathic paddati upachaar kii ek nishchit prakriya apana rahi ho to ayurveda ko bhi apane upachaar va aushadhiyon main paardarshita apnaani hogi
 After this, Warrier first established the Arya Vaidyasala for the manufacture of medicines at Kottakkal in 1902 for the standardization of Ayurveda, under whose supervision medicines were made based on authentic Ayurvedic texts
 angrezi dawaaon kii bhanti hi pehali baar arya vaidyashaala ne ayurvaidic aushadhiyon ko maanak khuraaq va packing main lambe samay tak upyogi rahane yogya banaaya
 This was a major change in the field of manufacture of Ayurvedic medicines
 1907 main variyar ne ayurveda vaidya samajam kii sthapana kii
 Warrier's aim behind this was to find harmony in allopathy and Ayurveda
 ek vidwaan chikitsak ke rup main variyar jaanate the ki ayurveda ko allopathy ke kuch naveenatam tareekon ko apnaanaa hoga
 As an Ayurveda physician, Warrier wanted to train other vaidyas better
 variyar ne ayurveda vaidya samajam main triancor, cochin tathaa malabar ke ayurvedic chikitsakon ko joda tha
 After 50 years, these areas were merged to create the modern state of Kerala
 dekha jaae to variyar ne ek sampoorn kerala rajya kii kalpana apane samay ke bahut pehle kar lee thi
 PS Warrier published the use, dosage and other information of Ayurvedic medicines in the listed format for codification and dissemination of the prevalent knowledge of Ayurveda so that any normal person would be able to use the medicines without a prescription
 aam logon ko ayurveda se parichit karne ke liye unhone malayalam main 'chikitsa samagraham' naamak ek pustak bhi likhi
 Similarly, Warrier published the Malayalam version of the book Ashtanga Hridayam Namak and his cousin PV
 In collaboration with Krishna Warrier, he prepared a book in Malayalam on the history of Ayurveda
 1917 main variyar ne ayurveda kii pramanik shiksha ke liye ayurveda paathshaala kii sthapana kii taaki is parmparik shiksha ko aadhunik, secular tathaa vaigyanik banaaya ja sake
 This was a major revolutionary step of his time as students started getting admission in this Ayurveda school without any distinction of religion, caste and varna
 kai vidhyaarthiyon ko chaatravruti bhi di gayi
 Warrior not only incurred the expense of setting up this Ayurveda school but he also taught himself the latest subjects of medical science in it
 aadhunik chikitsa vigyaan ke enatomi tathaa fiziolji jaise vishyon ko ayurveda paathshaala main padhaane ke liye unhone ashtaang shariram tathaa brihat shariram namak do pustakon kii rachana bhi kii
 Today this Ayurveda school Vaidyaratnam PS The Warrior Government is affiliated with the University of Calicut under the name of Ayurveda College
 ayurveda main vaigyanik drushtikon ke prasar hetu variyar ne dhanvantari naamak ek ayurveda jarnal kaa sampaadan kiya
 He did not consider Ayurveda only business
 unka uddeshy is gauravpurn gyaan, vidya, shaastra ko vilupt hone se bachaana or is vilakshan ayurvigyaan kaa jirnoddhar karnaa tha
 In 1924, he established a charitable hospital
 is ayurveda chikitsaalay main unhone allopathic upachaar kii vyavastha bhi rakhi thi
 In 1932, the Government of India gave P
S
 Warrior was conferred with the title of Vaidyaratnam
 variyar ko ayurveda aushadhiyon main prayukt vibhinn jadi-bootiyon kii shuddhta ke liye unhen swayan upjane kii vyavastha kii
 Today about a thousand types of rare herbs are grown in the gardens of the Vaidyasala
 ayurveda kisi ek rog kaa nahin balki rogi kaa sarvangin upachaar karata he
 That is why in Ayurveda so many rules, restraint, diet, thought, meditation, perception are emphasized
 ek utkrisht vaidya hone ke naate 1932 main variyar ne arya vaidyashaala ke praangan main ek bhavy mandir kaa nirmaan kiya jisase rogi apni shaareerik pidaa or maansik udwelan se upar uth sake
 Denying all social conventions of that time, every person of every religion, caste, varna had freedom to enter this temple
 variyar swayan sanskrit ke bade gyaata the
 He had a keen interest in literature, poetry, drama and dance
 1909 main variyar ne param sivaa vilasam natya mandali kii sthapana kii
 In 1939, this theatrical group was given a PSV
 The Natya was converted into Sangham which is today a major Kathakali group in Kerala
 1933 main hi unhone apni apana sara dhan parivaar or kutumb ko dene ke bajaay arya vaidyashaala ko pradaan kar di
 In 1944, P

 The Phantom is the fictional and fantasy protagonist of a long-running series of American adventure comics / novels, first published in February 1936 by magician Mandrake author Lee Faulk, who now publishes Frye Publications primarily internationally
 mukhya kirdaar, "fantom", kaalpanik poshaak pahana ek krim-fiter he jiskaa sharansthal africa ke kaalpanik raashtra bangala main bataaya jaataa hai
 The fame of this character has been greatly forgotten in Doordarshan, film and video games
 is shrankhla kaa aarambh farvari 17, 1936 se dainik samachar patron main strip yaa pattee ke rup jari kiya gaya, ore phir may 28, 1939 kii ravivaar ke saptahik taur par rangeen pattee ke rup main jari kiya gaya;or donon hi varsh 2016 tak abbhi jari he
 In 1966, King Features claimed that "the Phantom" then continued its publication in 583 different newspapers globally
 apni lokapriyata ke charam par, is pattee ko prayek din 100 karod se adhik logon ke dwaara padhaa gaya tha
 Faulk continued on "the Phantom" until his death until 1999; Currently, after his passing, his comics were written by Tony d'paul and by Paula Ryan and Terry Bitty, who continued to work on illustrations

 In the comic strip, it is said that Phantom's 21st century crime fighting began in 1536, Christopher Walker's father was a British sailor who was attacked and killed by pirates
 apane mrit pita kii khopadi se vah pratigya letaa he ki sabhi tarah ke aparaadh evam aparaadhiyon ke unmoolan karegaa, christopher dwaara shuru kiya "da fantom" kii viraasat peedi dar peedi pita se bete tak nibhaate rahen
 Many gave Phantom nicknames such as "the Walking Phantom", "guardian of the Eastern Dark", and "azar-immortal Man"
 vahiin anya kalpit nayakon kii tarah poshaak pahanane ke baavjood, fantom ke paas koi alokik yaa amanviya shaktiyaan nahin hai magar ucch str kii shaareerik kushalta, bemisaal budhimatta or logon kii kinvadantiyon ke anusaar amar hone kii dharna yaa dehshat hi shatruon ko parrast karne ke liye kaaphi he
 The 21st-generation Phantom is married to Diana Palmer; Where he met while studying in the US, and after marriage he also had two children, Kit and Helluys
 uske paas devil naamak, ek prashikshit bhediya or hero naamak ghoda rahata he
 And like his ancestor Phantom, he also lives in the ancient skull cave
 fantom pratham fantasy nayak hai jinhone kasi hui poshaak main swayan ko prastut kiya jisaki ek baangi aage chalakar anya kamiks nayakon main bhi najar ai, or pehla nakaab jisase putaliyaan najar nahin aati 
 According to comics historian Peter Kugan, this phase of Phantom has been quite "transitional", leading to the arrival of other Pulp magazine heroes such as The Shadow and The Spider, similar to Phantom's character, protagonists of other comics stories in the same apprehensive forms Superman, Batman and Captain America were also born
 king fitures mandrek da magician kii safalataa ke baad, faaq se sawaal kiya ki aage bhavishya main kya bananaa chahenge
 In his first attempt, he worked on writing and painting about "king Arthur and His Nights"
 par jab king fitures ne is strip ko lene se inkaar kiya to fah ne "da fantom" ke vikaas par dhyaan lagaaya, ek rahasyamayi shaks, jo chhadam poshaak pahanakar aparaadh se ladata he

 During his first story, "the Lion Brotherhood", Faq kept the jungle in his background, altering the phantom from the stories of Wales and giving Phantom a directly immortal, and mythical shape
 halaaki unka vichaar tha ki "da fantom" naam se or kai kirdaar pehle hi gadhe ja chuke the, faaq ne tab apane nayak ko "da grey ghost" kii upnaam se oopaadhi di 
 Despite not suggesting him a better name, he has decided to continue with the name "the Phantom"
 vahiin e

i america cabel tivi dwaara prasaarit "da fantom: kamiks strip crosader" ke saakshaatkaar vritchitr main, faaq bataate he ki unhen greek pratimaaon ko dekhakar hi fantom kii putaliyaan mitaane kii prerana mili jab uskaa charitra apana nakaab dhaaran karata he
 He believes that the effigies of the Greek statues are not made — now either painted on them, or blurred over time — and this would make them look inhuman, or very frightening
