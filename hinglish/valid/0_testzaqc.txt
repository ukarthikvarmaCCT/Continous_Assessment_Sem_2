 This decision was taken after much deliberation on the question of the official language of independent India on 14 September 1949, which is described in section 343 of Chapter 17 of the Constitution of India as follows: yah nirnay 14 sitambar ko liya gaya, is kaaran hindi diwas ke liye is din ko shreshth mana gaya tha
 However, when it was chosen and implemented as the official language, people from non-hindi speaking states started opposing it and English too had to be given the status of official language
 is kaaran hindi main bhi angrezi bhashaa kaa prabhaav padane laga
 Many programs take place during Hindi Divas
 is din chaatr-chaatraon ko hindi ke prati sammaan or dainik vyavhaar main hindi ke upyog karne aadi kii shiksha di jaati he
 In which Hindi essay writing, debate, Hindi typing competition etc
 are held
 hindi diwas par hindi ke prati logon ko prerit karne hetu bhashaa sammaan kii shuruyaat kii gai he
 This honor will be given annually to such a personality of the country, who has made a special contribution to the use and upliftment of Hindi language among the people
 iske liye sammaan swaroop ek lakh ek hajaar rupee diye jate hai
 Many suggestions for the development and expansion of Hindi language are also obtained at many places through essay writing competition in Hindi
 lekin agle din sabhi hindi bhashaa ko bhul jate hai
 Remember the Hindi language for a few more days, for this reason Rajbhasha Week is also organized
 jisase yah kam se kam varsh main ek saptaah ke liye to rahati hi he
 It is the fourth largest language in the world after English and Chinese by number of speakers
 lekin use acchhee tarah se samajhane, padhane or likhane waalon main yah sankhya bahut hi kam he
 It is becoming even less
 iske saath hi hindi bhashaa par angreji ke shabdon kaa bhi bahut adhik prabhaav hua he or kai shabd prachlan se hat gaye or angrezi ke shabd ne uski jagah le lee he
 Due to which the possibility of extinction of language has also increased in future
 is kaaran aise log jo hindi kaa gyaan rakhte hai yaa hindi bhashaa jaanate hai, unhen hindi ke prati apane kartavya kaa bodh karwaane ke liye is din ko hindi diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he jisase ve sabhi apane kartavya kaa paalan kar hindi bhashaa ko bhavishya main vilupt hone se bachaa saken
 But both the people and the government seem indifferent to this
 hindi to apane ghar main hi daasi ke rup main rahati he
 Hindi has not been made the language of the United Nations till date
 ise vidambnaa hi kahenge ki yoga ko 177 deshon kaa samarthan mila, lekin hindi ke liye 129 deshon kaa samarthan kya nahin jutaya ja saktaa? iske aise halaat aa gaye hai ki hindi diwas ke din bhi kai logon ko twitor par hindi main bolo jaise shabdon kaa upyog karnaa pad rahaa he
 Amar Ujala also begged people to tweet in Hindi at least on Hindi Divas
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy varsh main ek din is baat se logon ko rubaru karana he ki jab tak ve hindi kaa upyog puri tarah se nahin karenge tab tak hindi bhashaa kaa vikaas nahin ho saktaa he
 It is advisable to use Hindi in place of English in all government offices on this one day
 iske alaava jo varsh bhar hindi main achche vikaas kaary karata he or apane kaary main hindi kaa acchhee tarah se upyog karata he, use puraskaar dwaara sammanit kiya jaataa he
 Many people use English language words or even English in their common colloquial, which is gradually threatening the existence of Hindi
 yahan tak ki varanasi main sthit duniya main sabase badi hindi sanstha aaj bahut hi khasta haal main he
 For this reason, all of them are requested to use Hindi in their colloquial language on this day
 iske alaava logon ko apane vichaar aadi ko hindi main likhane bhi kaha jaataa he
 Since very few people know about the tools to write in Hindi language, due to this, information about writing, checking and dictionary in Hindi language is given on this day
 hindi bhashaa ke vikaas ke liye kuch logon ke dwaara kaary karne se koi khaas laabh nahin hoga
 For this, everyone will have to unite and bring the development of Hindi to a new dimension
 hindi bhashaa ke vikaas or vilupt hone se bachaane ke liye yah anivaary he
 Rajbhasha Week or Hindi Week is celebrated on September 14 for a week from Hindi Day
 is puure saptaah alag alag pratiyogita kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 The event is held both in school and office
 iskaa mul uddeshy hindi bhashaa ke liye vikaas kii bhaavana ko logon main keval hindi diwas tak hi simit na kar use or adhik badhanaa he
 In these seven days, people are explained about the development of Hindi language and the advantages and disadvantages of not using it through essay writing, etc
 hindi diwas par hindi ke prati logon ko utsahit karne hetu puraskaar samaaroh bhi yojit kiya jaataa he
 In which this award is given to those who use good Hindi during work
 yah pehle rajanetaaon ke naam par tha, jise baad main badal kar rajbhasha kirti puraskaar or rajbhasha gaurav puraskaar kar diya gaya
 Rajbhasha Gaurav Award is given to the people while Rajbhasha Kirti Award is given to a department, committee etc
 yah puraskaar takneekee yaa vigyaan ke vishay par likhane vaale kisi bhi bhartiya naagarik ko diya jaataa he
 There are 13 awards ranging from ten thousand to two lakh rupees
 isamen pratham puraskaar praapt karne vaale ko 2 lakh rupe, dwitiya puraskaar praapt karne vaale ko dedh lakh rupe or tritiy puraskaar praapt karne vaale ko pachhattar hajaar rupee miltaa he
 Besides, ten people are given ten thousand rupees as incentive award
 puraskaar praapt sabhi logon ko smriti chihn bhi diya jaataa he
 Its basic objective is to advance Hindi language in the field of technical and science
 is puraskaar yojana ke tahat kul 39 puraskaar diye jate hai
 This award is given to a committee, department, board etc
 for the best work done by him in Hindi
 iskaa mul uddeshy sarkari kaaryon main hindi bhashaa kaa upyog karne se he
 Many Hindi writers and those who know Hindi language say that Hindi Day is just like official work, which is celebrated for only one day
 isse hindi bhashaa kaa koi bhi vikaas nahin hota he, balki isse hindi bhashaa ko haani hoti he
 Many people also welcome people by writing in English language in Hindi Day celebrations
 sarkaar ise keval yah dikhaane ke liye chalaati he ki vah hindi bhashaa ke vikaas hetu kaary kar rahi he
 The government employees themselves are also seen working in English instead of Hindi
 lekin kuch logon kii soch yah bhi he ki vividh kaaran bataakar hindi diwas manaane kaa virodh karne or majaak udaane vaale yah chaahate hai ki hindi ke prati rahi-sahi apnatv kii bhaavana bhi samaapt kii jaay

 It has been launched primarily in view of Pakistan's ballistic missile threat
 is kaarykram ke tahat do missile kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 Prithvi Air Defense has been developed to shoot down high altitude missiles and advanced air defense to hit low altitude missiles
 yah donon missile 5000 kilometre dur se aa rahi missile ko maar gira sakati he
 The Prithvi Air Defense missile was tested in November 2006 and the Advance Air Defense in December 2007
 prithvi air dephence missile ke test ke saath bharat anti belistic missile test karne vaala america, rus tathaa israel ke baad duniya kaa chauthaa desh ban gaya
 Tests of this system are still underway and have not been officially included in the army
 90 ke dashak ke prarambh se hi, bharat ne pakistan se belistic missile hamalon kaa khatra saamne kiya he, bharat ko ateet main pakistan or china se kai yuddh ladane pade hai
 In response to the escalating tensions in the region and Pakistan's deployment of M-11 missiles purchased from China, the Indian government on August 1995 launched six consignments of Russia's S-300 surface-to-air missiles to protect New Delhi and other cities
 Purchased may 1998 main, duusari baar bharat ne parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa pareekshan kiya, iske baad pakistan ne apana pehla parmaanu pareekshan kiya
 With Pakistan testing nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems, the missile threat to India intensified
 bharat ne missile delivery pranali kaa bhi vikaas or pareekshan kiya he
 In 1999, the Kargil war between India and Pakistan became the first direct conflict between the two declared nuclear powers
 yuddh kii pragati ke saath, parmaanu hathiyaar ke sambhavit upyog kaa pehla sanket 31 may ko mila tha, jab pakistani videsh sachiv shamashaad ahamed ne ek chetavanee di ki simit sangharsh ke chalate pakistan ko apane shastraagaar main "kisi bhi hathiyaar" kaa istemaal karne main madad mil sakati he
 This immediately conveyed the danger of nuclear deterrence by Pakistan in the event of an extended war
 pakistan ke seenet ke netaa ne kaha ki "vikasshil hathiyaaron kaa uddeshy arthhin ho jaataa he yadi ve aavashyak padane par upyog nahin kiye jaye
 "some experts believe that after the nuclear tests in 1998, the Pakistani Army was motivated by its nuclear deterrent cover to increase the strength against India
 anti belistic missile pranali kaa vikaas 1999 ke ant main shuru hua
 Stating that India followed a policy of not using it earlier during the war, Pakistan was keen to use the atomic bomb in this war and the increasing tension during the Kargil war, including the possibility of a full-scale nuclear war 
 is kaaran is kaarykram ko shuru kiya gaya he
 The program was divided into two phases
 charan-1 main 2000 kimi se aane vaali missile ko rokane ke liye anti belistic missile banani thi jise charan-2 main 5000 kimi tak karnaa tha
 Development of anti ballistic missile system started in 1999
 lagbhag 40 saarvajanik or nijee companiyaan system ke vikaas main shaamil thim
 These include Bharat Electronics Limited and Bharat Dynamics Limited, Astra Microwave, ASL, Larsen & Toubro, Vem Technologies Private Limited and Caltech
 long range trekking radar or multi function fire control radar kaa vikaas electronics or radar deveopment astablishment ne kiya tha
 The Defense Research and Development Laboratory has developed mission control software for the advance air defense missile
 research centre, imaraat ne nevigation, electromacenical actuation system or sakriy radar sadhak kaa vikaas kiya
 The Advanced Systems Laboratory provided motors, jet vans and structures for advance air defense and Prithvi air defense
 ucch urja saamagree anusandhan prayogshaala ne missile ke liye pranodakon kii aapurti kii
 Two new anti ballistic missiles that can intercept intermediate range ballistic missiles are being developed
 lagbhag 5000 kimi se aane vaali belistic mixilon ko nasht karne ke liye in ucch gati mixilon ko viksit kii ja rahaa hai
 The test of these two systems is expected to be tested in 2011
 The new missile will be similar to the Thad missile deployed by the US
 in missile kii gati hypersonic hogi or isane 1500 kimi se adhik kii scan kshamta ke saath radar kii aavashyaktaa hogi taaki lakshya ko safaltaapurvak avrodh kar sake
 On 6 May 2012, Dr VK Saraswat confirmed the completion of phase-i, saying that Phase-2 would be completed by 2016, in which missiles coming from 5000 km could be destroyed
 mixilon ko avaruddh karne or nasht karne ke liye bharat apane bachaav ke hisse ke rup main lager aadhaarit hathiyaar pranali viksit karne kii bhi yojana bana rahaa he taaki desh kii ore chodi gai missile ko launch ke turant baad nasht kiya ja sake diardio ke vaayu raksha kaarykram ke nideshak ve ke saraswat kaha hai ki yah parmaanu yaa paramparaagat hathiyaar le jane vaale belistic missile ko nasht karne kaa adarsh hoga
 Saraswat further said that it will take 10-15 years from the Defense Research Institute to make it eligible for defense
 do stareey belistic missile dephence system main prithvi air dephence shaamil he jo mixilon ko 50-80 kimi ke exo-vayumandaleey oonchai par roak degaa or 30 kimi tak oonchai par ando-vayumandaleey avarodhan ke liye advance air dephence missile he
 The deployed system will include several launch vehicles, radars, launch control centers, and mission control centers
 in sabhi ko bhugolic rup se vitarit kiya jaataa he or ek surakshit sanchaar network dwaara judaa jaataa he
 Mission Control Center is a software intensive system of ballistic missile defense system
 yah vibhinn sroton jaise radar or upgrahon se jaankaree praapt karata he, jiske baad ek saath chalane vaale das computaron dwaara is jaankaree process kiya jaataa he
 The mission control center is connected to all other elements of defense through a wide area network
 mishan control centre lakshya vargeekaran, lakshith moolyankan or lakshya ko nasht karne kaa akalan karata he
 It serves as a decision support system for the commander
 yah lakshya ko nasht karne kii sabhi sambhaavna ke liye aavashyak interceptor kii sankhya bhi tay kar saktaa he in sabhi kaaryon ko nishpadit karne ke baad, mishan control centre launch bydaree ke launch control centre ko lakshya kii jaankaree de detaa he
 The launch control center starts calculating the time to launch the interceptor based on the information received from the radar, the target speed, altitude and flight path etc
 launch control centre vaastavik samay main prakshepan ke liye missile taiyaar karata he or ground gidence computeshan ko jari karata he
 After launching the interceptor, it is provided target information to the interceptor through the information received from the radar
 When the interceptor is close to the target missile, the interceptor activates its radar finder for the target missile and destroys the target
 Guides oneself
 or lakshya ko nasht kar detaa he ucch maar sambhaavnaaon ke liye lakshya ke khilaaf kai prithvi air dephence or advance air dephence interceptor launch kiye ja sakate hai
 According to DRDO scientist Vijay Kumar Saraswat, the missile is designed to hit 99
8 percent of any target
 6 may 2012 ko dow
