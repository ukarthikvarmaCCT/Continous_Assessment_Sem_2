 But how much an element can get to the plant depends on many things, such as which mineral is present in the soil, how much of the soil is in the form of soil, how much moisture is in the soil and its acidity
 adhikansh fasalon ke liye bhoomi main nitrogen, fasphoras tathaa potacium daalana upyogi paaya gaya he, kyonki ye tatv vibhinn fasalon dwaara newnaadhik maatra main nikal jate hai
 Therefore, it is necessary to see that the balance of these elements of the land remains as per the requirement of the plants
 kisi ek tatv ke bahut adhik maatra main daalane se duusare tatwon main kami yaa asantulan utpann ho saktaa he, jisase upaj main kami aa sakati he
 Nitrogen and botanical substances are the most important parts of manure for Indian soil
 yah samaran rahe ki bhoomi-bhoomi main antar hota he; isliye is sambandh main koi ek vyapak nuskhaa nahin bataaya ja saktaa jiskaa prayog sarvatra kiya ja sake
 Some nitrogen-giving items are: - Organic sources: compost of dung, droppings, urine, garbage, etc
; Khali and green crops that can be used as manure, such as linseed, tinapatiya moong, dhencha etc
 ajivajanit strot : uria, jisamen 40 pratishat nitrogen hota he, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate tathaa sodium nitrate 
 Ordinary: 50 to 12 pounds of nitrogen per acre in the land can be expected to be satisfactory
 yah sambhav he ki fasphoras bhoomi main paryaapt maatra main rahe, parantu padpon ko keval dhire-dhire praapt ho
 It has been observed that sometimes where other crops were very poor, the fruit garden flourishes very well without adding phosphorus material to the ground, probably because the fruit trees need phosphorus gradually
 It only happens
 khaadon main tathaa sabhi prakaar ke jeevajanit padaarthon main kuch-na-kuch fasphoras rahata he
 But the phosphorous special things are these - bone powder, basic slag and super phosphate which are used extensively
 isamen 16 se 40 pratishat fasphoras pentaxide rahata he
 In those soils that stabilize phosphorus, the first phosphorus must be added so that some phosphorus is left for plants even when stabilized, but those that do not stabilize phosphorus should not contain a large amount of phosphorus, Otherwise the balance will deteriorate and other components will fall
 jis bhoomi main sulabh potacium kii maatra bahut hi kam hoti he usamen potacium dene par darshneey antar padataa he, jo upaj kii vruddhi se spasht ho jaataa he
 Potassium sulfate and potassium chloride are commonly used for fertilizer
 inamen se prayek main lagbhag 50 pratishat potacium oxide hota he
 Potassium nitrate contains 44 percent potassium oxide; Along with this, 13 percent nitrogen is also present
 jeevajanit khaadon main bhi 50 pratishat yaa adhik potacium oxide ho saktaa he

 vyakaran se sambandhit 'ling' ke liye ling dekhen
 Gender in biology refers to the identities or traits by which a male is distinguished from a female in an organism
 jantuon main asankhya jantu aise hote hai jinhen keval bahya chihnon se hi nar, yaa maadaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Male and female are judged by two types of signs, primary and secondary sexual characteristics
 vanaspatik jagat main nar tathaa maadaa kaa bhed, viksit praaniyon kii bhanti, pruthak-pruthak nahin paaya jaataa
 Which is true
 aaj hindi main ling yani ling shabd kaa arth nar shishn se lagaaya jaataa he lekin mul sanskrit main iskaa arth chihn, pratik athwa lakshan ke arth main he
 This word appears several times in the Vaishneshika philosophy of Kanad Muni
 janan kaa itihaas dekha jaae to gyaat hoga ki sansar ke aadi jeevon kii utpatti alangik dhang se hui; jaise protozoa tathaa protophita ke anek roopon main nar tathaa maadaa dwaara milakar sristi nahin hui
 These organisms originated through body fragmentation, Mukulan and spore formation
 vikaas ke duusare charan main nar tathaa maadaa ke atyant sookshm lakshan prakat hone lage
 Some other organisms in the Protozoa range began to produce offspring by conjugation
 isamen ek hi prakaar ke do jeev aapas main milakar ekaakaar hone par phir vibhajit hokar anek sankhya main utpann hone lage, jaise volvox ke nivahon main dekha jaataa he
 After this came the third stage of penis development, in which both male and female genitals developed inside the same creature, eg, earthworm, leech etc
 ling vikaas kii antim avasthaa main nar tathaa maadaa jananaang sarvatha pruthak ho gaye, jaisaa kutton, bandaron, gaay, bakriyon tathaa manushyon aadi main dekha jaataa he

 Similarly, in the botanical world, the aroma, color, splendor, fruit production etc
 of the flowers have sexual characteristics
 praaniyon main ling kaa nirdhaaran teen prakaar se hota he : Even before fertilization, nishechan ke samay tathaa After fertilization
 kintu, saamanytah ling kaa nirdhaaran nishechan ke hi samay hona mana jaataa he
 Fertilization of a male's sperm with a female's ovary is called fertilization
 vaataavaran main nishechit andey, yaa yugmanaj kii kramash: vruddhi hoti rahati he
 Male and female are determined by some complex processes
 vaigyanikon ne is sambandh main kai siddhant upasthit kiye hai
 Among these theories, the following two theories are relatively more famous: chromosome, or chromosome theory, and hormone theory
 anuvanshik vigyaan ke anusaar praaniyon ke sharir main jo koshikaaye pai jaati hai, unamem kuch aisi rachanaayen hoti he jo vishesh prakaar ke ranjakon or abhiranjakon ko grahan kar leti hai, in rachanaaon ko chromosome kaha jaataa he
 In genetic science, only chromosomes found in gametes, or sex cells, are considered
 bhinn-bhinn praaniyon kii janan koshikaon main chromosomon kii sankhya is prakaar pai gai hai : Creature name --- number of chromosomes saikan spanj -- 26 Hydra --- 30 - 32 lambricus vansh kii jonk --- 32 Unio Oyster --- 32 taramin --- 36 Lobster --- 48 bichchhi --- 24 a fish --- 24 buphotod --- 24 - 26 Kachchhagana --- 56 magar --- 32 Sheep --- 60 ghoda --- 60 - 66 Monkey --- 48 maanav --- 46 Netrix --- 40 kapotvansh yaa colambaa --- 66 Cock --- 18 - 20 chamagadad --- 24 Rabbit of Leapus clan --- 28 - 36 kutta --- 50 - 78 Fox --- 38 billi --- 66 Chopped --- 38 - 60 bakra --- 60 Buffalo --- 48 - 56 boar --- 38 - 40 Chimpanzee --- 48 oont --- 70 In 1901–2, a scholar named mcclung discovered the chromosome
 usee ne kuch siddhant bhi banaae, jo kalantar main vaigyanik anusandhanon dwaara pusht hote gaye
 In this theory it is assumed that the sex of each creature depends on the number of certain chromosomes
 chromosomon kii rachana ko yadi adhik shaktishaalee sookshmdarshi, jaise electron sookshmdarshi dwaara dekha jaae to usamen bhi kuch bahut hi sookshm rachanaayen dikhaai padegi
 They are called genes and it is believed that these transmit the genetic properties of the parent to their offspring
 jantuon or vanaspatiyon ke chromosomon tathaa jeenon ko lekar bahut adhik anusandhan or prayog hue hai
 It has been found that some of the chromosomes found in the reproductive cells of each living organism are known as alingusutra
 ye nar tathaa maadaa donon main ek prakaar ke hi hote hai or sadaa yugma main rahete hai
 Some other types of chromosomes are also found, which are called sex determinants
 ab tak jitne prakaar ke chromosome paae gaye hai, unhen eks, vaai, dablyoo, zed tathaa o kii sangya di gai he
 Male and female are believed to be determined by the same and odd number of these sex-bearing chromosomes, such that sex in humans is determined as follows: 21 aling sutara + 1 eks + 1 vaai = purush; tathaa 21 Alling Sutra + 2x = Female
 chromosomon kii sankhya ke anusaar nar tathaa maadaa ko vishamyugmaki yaa samayugmaki kaha jaataa he
 a creature has a male homozygote, then a female
 pakshiyon, titliyon, machhliyon, jalsthalchar aadi main maadaa vishamyugmaki hoti he
 In these animals, the sex-bearing chromosomes are named z and W, while in other animals and flora, they are referred to as x and Y
 anek praaniyon main eks tathaa vaai hi nar yaa maadaa ling kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 When a sperm with x is combined with a female's egg, the zygote receives two X's and becomes a female
 kintu jab shukranu kaa vaai maadaa ke andey ke eks se sanyukt hota he, tab yugmanaj ko eks vaai, arthath visham sankhya praapt hoti he or vah nar hota he
 The distinction found in the chromosomes of males and females of humans and other creatures is shown in the table on the next page
 jis prakaar jantuon main chromosomon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he, usee prakaar vanaspatiyon main bhi unka adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Most seed plants are hermaphroditic, meaning they have male and female sexes together
 chromosomon kii gananaa hone par bhi ling kii charchaa keval nar-maadaa-vishleshan ke hi sandarbh main kii jaati he, kyonki ling or anuvanshikta kii samasya vanaspati jagat main nahin he
 Some species have separate male and female plants
 aise paudhon ke bhi eks tathaa vaai chromosomon kaa pataa chalaa he, jaise elodia canadensis, milandrium album aadi
 a seedling plant, Frageria elitior, is described as a bird with chromosomes
 kuch anya paudhon main nar vishmalingi hote hue bhi do vaai tathaa ek eks dhaaran karata he
 At the time of degradation, both y and x are separated and are formed by the formation of two y reproductive cells into a male and an x female embryo
 isi prakaar ling kaa nirdhaaran anya paudhon main bhi hota he
 There are some glands in the body of beings that are called ductless or endocrine
 kuch viksit visheshkar kasheruki jantuon main in grathiyon ke sraavon kaa, jinhen hormone kehete hai, adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Whether or not there are hormones in vegetation is also a controversial subject
 jantuon ke sharir main pai janevaali grathiyon ke naam hai : piyush, piniyal, avatugranthi, parathyroid, thimus, packrius yaa agnyashay, vrikk ; janangranthi, nar main vrushan tathaa maadaa main andashay 
 The hormones originating from these glands have been studied in detail and it has been found that the existence of secondary sexual traits related to masculinity in a male creature and femininity in a female depends on their action
 jin or chromosome keval yah nishchit karte hai ki yugmanaj nar hoga yaa maadaa
 Determination of actual masculinity and femininity and their development in the proper direction is done only with the help of secretions of the ductless glands
 jaise, koi bhrun purush ke rup main janm lene vaala ho to stri hormonon kii sooyee lagaakar athwa use badhiya kar dene or uske sthaan par andashay grathiyon ko aropit kar dene par vah yaa to purnroopen stri ho jayega, yaa usamen stritv ke lakshan viksit ha jaayenge

 bhrun ke vikaas ke saath hi saath nar or maadaa nirdharak tatv bhi samaan rup se hi viksit hote hai
 An animal is not only male or female because it is formed by a particular number of chromosomes, but also male or female because it has "suppressed" other elements that are female or male determinants
 sabhi hormonon kaa utpaadan sharir main hota rahata he, at: jab stritv, yaa purushatv nirdharak hormone adhik shaktishaalee honge tab bhrun stri, yaa purush sharir tathaa pravritiyon kii ore agrasar hoga
 The result of the balance of hormones is that the creature is born as a male or female
 court stern ne yah dikhalaayaa he ki yadi kisi stri main do eks ke sthaan par teen eks hon, to usamen apekshaakrit adhik stritv hoga
 But such a woman will be late in the season, extremely young and completely barren

 Sexual division in insects does not depend on the reproductive glands
 unke mukhya janakaatmak lakshan is prakaar hote hai : nar eks o, yaa eks vaai ; maadaa eks eks
 In 1923, Finkler cut off the foreheads of some male pests and applied them on females and the foreheads of females
 in prayogon main yah paaya gaya ki kiton ne apane sharir ke anusaar nahin apitu mastak ke anusaar kaam kiya, arthath nar mastak vaali maadaaon ne nar kii bhanti tathaa maadaa mastakwale naron ne maadaa kii bhanti langik lakshan prakat kiye
 There is a clear difference in the shape and form of the male and female of many animals
 ise langik dvirupata kehete hai
 It has been reported that in the third stage of sexual development, differences of male and female began to appear
 dhire-dhire andashay tathaa vrishanon kaa vikaas hua or sahaayak ang bhi kramash: viksit hote gaye
 Male and female genitalia are found in the same body in many lower organisms, and also in flora
 jyon jyon ucch varg kii ore badha jayega to yah milegaa ki ling spasht hi pruthak ho gaye hai or nar tathaa maadaa sharir kii rachana bhi pruthak he
 a familiar example of sexual dimorphism is a marine worm called Bonelia viridis
 isaki maadaa hare rang kii tathaa akruti main ber jaisi hoti he
 Under the stones or in their holes in the ocean floor, this worm lives
 vahiin se apni dwishakhit shund ko baahar laharaate hue yah jeev aahaar dhoondta rahata he
 The male worm is very fine and apart from the genitals, all its other organs are depleted
 maadaa ke sharir ke bheetar nar krimi paropjivi kii bhanti rahata he
 Fertilized ovaries develop like larvae floating freely in water
 yadi koi larva samudratal main baith jaataa he, athwa kisi maadaa ke shund main pahunch nahin paata he, to vah maadaa ke rup main viksit hone lagata he
 But if somehow he reaches by attracting the female to the Shunda, he develops into a male
 maadaa ke shund main bandi bouna nar, sarakate hue use munh main tathaa vahaan se bhi dhire dhire neeche sarakate hue maadaa kii janan nalika main pahunchakar, dimbashyon ko nishechit karata he
 The fertilized ovaries are re-released into the water and swim freely like larvae

 Gender linkage means variation in the sexes according to the genes found in sexual chromosomes
 in jeenon par jo gun yaa visheshak nirbhar karte hai, unhen ling sahalagnta kehete hai
 The transmission method of these traits or traits is called sex-linked inheritance, such as XY in male and XX chromosome in female
 koi purush yadi kisi anuvanshik dosha se dooshit he, to keval uske putr hi us dosha ko vanshagati main grahan kar sakate hai, putriyaan nahin
 First, in 1908, Doncaster threw light on this subject
 unhone ek shalab abracsas lacticler kii maadaa kaa abraxs grossulariata ke nar se sanyog karaayaa
 As a result, in the first generation, all moths of the genus Grossulariata were found
 duusari peedi main grossulariata tathaa lacticler ke anupaat 3:1 the, kintu sabhi lacticler maadaa nikle
 This showed that in this creature the male produces one type of gametes, but the female has two types
 at: nar samayugmaji tathaa maadaa vishamyugmaji hoti he
 Bravel states that the x chromosome contains some other types of genetic factors and genes
 yadi yah siddhant thik he, to samayugmaji mata pita ke visheshak unke vishamyugmaji santanon main chale jaayenge
 This principle is called gender cohesion, such as two x chromosomes found in the female of the fruitfly Drosophila and x y in the male
 iske eks chromosomon main laal aankhon ke jin honge, yaa shwet aankhon ke
 Red-eye genes are called effective and white is ineffective

 Haemophilia and color blindness are considered to be the major diseases among the sexes
 shukranu tathaa dimb sanyukt hokar ek yugmaj kaa nirmaan karte hai
 In the process of Khandi Bhavan, the same fertilized egg divides into several blocks until it becomes a complete embryo
 is prakriya main shukranu ke chromosome tathaa dimb ke chromosome ek saath milakar vibhajit hote rahete hai
 For example, 23 chromosomes of 23 male and 23 chromosomes are combined
 vibhaajan ke samay 23 chromosome ek chor kii ore tathaa 23 duusari ore chale jate hai
 These two ends are also called the daughter nucleus
 vibhaajan kii is saamaanya prakriya main anek prakaar ke dosha utpann ho sakate hai jaise ek centre main 22 chromosome chale jaaen tathaa duusare main 24, yaa koi anya durghatana ghat jaae to ise aviyojan kaha jayega
 Bridges is named with this principle
 inhone san 1916 main kuch utparivarti praaniyon kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 They found that both the x and x and x x y creatures were female, the XO animal was male, but incapable of child production and the OY animal did not increase
 jis praani main ek eks kam tha, use praathmik tathaa jisamen ek eks adhik tha, use gaun aviyojit kaha gaya
 Gender abnormalities occur as a result of the process of degradation
 ye asaamanyataayen mukhyat: teen prakaar kii hoti hai : stri purush ubhayalingi tathaa madhyalingi
 Stereotypes - Stereotypes include animals that have characteristics of both male and female, such as butterflies, birds and insect moths, some half of which are female and some have different characteristics in different proportions
 vaigyanikon kaa vishwaas he ki stripurush praani kaa jivan maadaa ke, jisamen eks eks upasthit he, rup main aarambh hota he
 When cell division begins

 As a result, only one y is present in a dividing cell
 is prakaar ke chromosomon kii asmaan sankhya ke kaaran nar tathaa maadaa kii akritiyon main bhinnata hoti jaati he
 Tests of the internal structure of such female-male beings reveal that their sperm and egg genitalia are also present
 yah asaamanyata un main adhik maatra main pai jaati he jinamein hormono kaa prabhaav atyalp hota he, athwa sarvatha nahin hota
 This is the reason why barbarism is not found in other developed and higher beings except for some birds
 ubhalingta - sansar ke lagbhag sabhi jeev ubhayalingi hote hai
 On the basis of which a creature develops in the direction of masculinity and femininity, not all scientists are unanimous in this regard
 koshika vibhaajan ke samay chromosomon kii sankhya main kyon antar aa jaataa he, athwa linganirmaan ke samay volfi tathaa mulari vahiniyon main se ek kaa kyon hraas ho jaataa he, yaa purushatv athwa stritv nirdharak hormone kisi niyam, yaa maatra se, kyon or kaise ni:sravit hote hai? in sab prashnon kaa koi santoshjanak uttar abhi vaigyanik nahin de paae hai
 Therefore, we will assume that being a man or a woman is a matter of coincidence
 prayek praani main yah kshamta hoti he ki vah nar, yaa maadaa main viksit ho jaae
 Bisexual is a vivid example of this
 ubhayalingi kai prakaar ke hote hai, jaise aise praani jo swanishechan karte hai, jaise hydra, feetakrimi, chapatakrimi aadi, duusare aise praani hote hai jo nishechan ke liye ek duusare par nirbhar karte hai; jaise kentua, jonk aadi
 In many species of plants too, some flowers in the same plant are found only in a particular part of the plant
 ucch shrenee ke anek paudhon main ek hi phool main strikesar tathaa punkesar samipsth hote hai taaki garbhaadhan main saralata ho
 In bisexuals, the internal and external characteristics of male and female are found simultaneously

 Bravel has stated that the genital glands of the innermost are of the same type, but some or all of the supporting organs and secondary characteristics decide the other sex, and their actual development takes place only through the influence of hormones
 san 1923 main kriu ne kuch gharelu pashuon kii jaanch kii or paaya ki unamem mithyaa madhyalingta thi, arthath kuch main to nari jananaang atyant sankuchit the, kuch main sidhe or spasht, kintu anpekshit lambey the, tathaa kuch main spashtat: nar ke samaan, kintu apurna nalikayukta the
 Testis and ovum glands were also present in some

 If she copulates more often, then the sex ratio can undergo a dramatic change
 murgi se balpurvak bachche paidaa karaae jaaen, to maadaa bachche adhik paidaa honge
 In relation to the secondary sex ratio, Creu has stated some rules: praaniyon kii jatiyon ke saath anupaat ghatata badhata rahata he, jaise 100 maadaaon ke anupaat main manushya nar 103-107, ghoda 98

 dusron ke anusaar nagarikaran, sankaran, saamaajik aarthik avasthaa, bhugolic vaataavaran aadi kaa bhi prabhaav linganupaat par padataa he
 The sex ratio is determined by sex conversion in other animals, such as the ratio of male and female in the immature creatures of Geophorus hilary to 0
5: 1, but in mature creatures this ratio is the opposite

 Lord Sri Rama wanted to present an understanding example of the world as Maryada Purushottam in this incarnation and hence became worried like a common man
 jab unhen sagar paar jane kaa koi maarg nahin mil rahaa tha tab unhone lakshmana se poocha ki he lakshmana is sagar ko paar karne kaa koi upaay mujhe sujh nahin rahaa agar tumhaare paas koi upaay he to bataao
 After listening to Shri Ramchandra ji, Lakshman said that the Lord has not hidden anything from you, you are self-supporting, yet i will say that half the plan away from here is the abode of the supreme knowledgeable Wakadalbhya Muni, we should ask him the solution
 bhagwaan shriram lakshmana samet vakdalbhy muni ke ashram main pahunche or unhen pranaam karke apana prashn unke saamne rakh diya

 smoke detector ek upkaran he jo khaas taur par aag ke suchak ke rup main dhuen kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Commercial, industrial and large-scale residential equipment signals a fire alarm system, while home detectors, called smoke alarms, typically locally heard and / or visible from the detector itself Give
 smoke detector ko khaas taur par discs ke aakaar vaale plastic ke ek ghere main rakhaa jaataa he jiskaa vyas lagbhag 150 millimetre evam motaai lagbhag 25 millimetre hoti he
 Most smoke detectors work by either optical detection or physical process, while other detectors use both methods of detection to increase sensitivity to smoke

 In the late 1930s, Swiss physicist Walter Jagger tried to invent a sensor for toxic gas
 He hoped that the gas entering the sensor would be bound to ionized air molecules and for that reason would change the electric current in the circuit of the device
 Their device failed: small concentrations of gas had no effect on the conductivity of the sensor
 Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette — and they were soon surprised to see that a meter of the instrument had informed the current
 dhune ke kanon ne bilkul vahi kaam kiya jise vifailli gas nahin kar pai thi
 Jagger's experiment was one of the efforts that paved the way for the modern smoke detector

 iske alaava, punah charge badariyon ke saath ek samasya unke upyogi charge ke ant main voltage main teji se kami hona he
 This is a concern in devices such as smoke detectors, because the battery can "charge" from "charged" so fast that the low-battery warning period from the detector is either so short that it is ignored
 Or they do not occur at all

 Wired units with a third "interconnected" wire allow a dozen or more detectors to be connected so that if one detects smoke the alarm will ring across all the detectors in the network, which increases this probability It will allow residents to be alerted, even if they are inside a closed door or the alarm is set one or two floors away from their place
 Wired interconnection can be practical to use only in new construction, especially if the wire needs to be moved to areas where it cannot be reached without piercing walls or roofs

 Due to this, the first union was formed in the direction of unification of Rajasthan
 yadi prashaasak na hote or rajkaaj kaa kaam pehle kii tarah raja hi dekhte to inkaa vilay asambhav tha kyonki in rajyon ke raja vilay kaa virodh kar rahe the
 The Matsya Union was inaugurated on 18 March 1948 and the erstwhile Maharaja of Dhaulpur, Uday Singh, was celebrated as its head
 isaki rajdhani alvar rakhi gayi thi
 The area of this new state called Matsya Union was about thirty thousand kilometers, the population was about 19 lakhs and the annual income was one crore 83 lakhs
 jab matsay sangh banaaya gaya tabhi vilay-patr main likh diya gaya ki baad main is sangh kaa 'rajasthan' main vilay kar diya jayega
 Second phase 25 March 1948 rajasthan ke ekikaran kaa doosraa charan pachchis march 1948 ko swatantra deshi riyasaton kota, bundi, jhalawad, tonk, duungarpur, banswada, pratapgarh, kishangarh or shahpura ko milakar bane rajasthan sangh ke baad puraa hua
 Kota was a major princely state in the merged princely states of Rajasthan, due to which its then Maharaja Maharao Bhimsingh was made Rajpramukh
 bundi ke tatkaaleen maharav bahadur singh rajasthan sangh ke rajpramukh bhimsingh ke bade bhai the, is kaaran unhen yah baat akhri ki chote bhai kii 'rajpramukhataa' main ve kaam kar rahe he
 This jealousy culminated in the third phase
 teesraa charan 18 april 1948 Maharao Bahadur Singh of Bundi did not want him to work under the royalty of his younger brother Maharao Bhimsingh, but it was the compulsion of the then Government of India to make Bhimsingh as the head of the state
 jab baat nahin bani to bundi ke maharav bahadur singh ne udaipur riyasat ko pataya or rajasthan sangh main vilay ke liye raji kar liya
 The intention behind this was that the Maharana of Udaipur would be made the Rajpramukh due to the large princely state and Maharao Bahadur Singh of Bundi would be saved from the compulsion to be under his younger brother Maharao Bhim Singh and it would avoid being recorded in the pages of history that The elder brother acted under the rule of younger brother
 atharah april 1948 ko rajasthan ke ekikaran ke tisare charan main udaipur riyasat kaa rajasthan sangh main vilay hua or iskaa nayaa naam hua 'sanyukt rajasthan sangh'
 In its cabinet headed by Manikya Lal Verma, Maharana Bhupal Singh of Udaipur was made the Rajpramukh, Maharao Bhim Singh of Kota was made the senior vice-president
 or kuch is tarah bundi ke maharaja kii chaal bhi safal ho gayi
 The fourth phase, thirty March 1949 isse pehle bane sanyukt rajasthan sangh ke nirmaan ke baad tatkaaleen bharat sarkaar ne apana dhyaan deshi riyasaton jodhpur, jaipur, jaisalmer or bikaner par kendrit kiya or isamen safalataa bhi haath lagi or in chaaron riyasto kaa vilay karwaakar tatkaaleen bharat sarkaar ne tees march 1949 ko vrihattar rajasthan sangh kaa nirmaan kiya, jiskaa udghaatan bharat sarkaar ke tatkaaleen riyasati or grih mantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne kiya
 The princely state of Bikaner first merged with India
 yahi 30 march aaj rajasthan kii sthapana kaa din mana jaataa he
 For this reason, this day is celebrated every year as Rajasthan Day
 haalanki abhi tak chaar deshi riyasto kaa vilay hona baaki tha, magar is vilay ko itnaa mahatv nahin diya jaataa, kyonki jo riyaste bachi thi ve pehle charan main hi 'matsay sangh' ke naam se swatantra bharat main vilay ho chuki thi
 These princely states named Alwar, Bhatarpur, Dholpur and Karauli had the suzerainty of the Government of India and due to this, their merger in Rajasthan was to be only formal
 paanchavaa charan 15 april 1949 The Government of India also adopted the formalities of merging Matsya Sandh in Greater Rajasthan on 15 April 1949
 bharat sarkaar ne 18 march 1948 ko jab matsay sangh banaaya tha tabhi vilay patr main likh diya gaya tha ki baad main is sangh kaa rajasthan main vilay kar diya jayega
 For this reason also, this phase was considered as a formality
 chatha charan 26 janvari 1950 On 26 January 1950, the princely state of Sirohi was also merged into Greater Rajasthan on the day the Indian Constitution came into force
 is vilay ko bhi aupchaarikta mana jaataa he kyonki yahaan bhi bharat sarkaar kaa niyantran pehle se hi tha
 Actually, when the process of unification of Rajasthan was going on, the ruler of the princely state of Sirohi was a minor
 is kaaran sirohi riyasat kaa kaamkaaj dovagarh kii maharani kii adhyakshata main agency concil hi dekh rahi thi jiskaa gathan bharat kii satta hastantaran ke liye kiya gaya tha
 Due to the dispute over Abu Delwada, a part of the princely state of Sirohi, the Abu Delvada tehsil was merged with Bombay and the rest of the princely state in Rajasthan at this stage
 santava charan ek november 1956 The people of Rajasthan did not want to lose the separate Abu Delwada tehsil running till now, because in this tehsil also came the abupavarvat called the Kashmir of Rajasthan, the land of other Rajasthanis, relatives of the surviving Sirohi residents and many even in other states
 Had gone andolan ho rahe the, andolan kaariyon ke jaij kaaran ko bharat sarkaar ko maananaa padaa or abu delvada tehsil kaa bhi rajasthan main vilay kar diya gaya
 In this phase, geographical and social errors were also rectified
 iske tahat madhyapradesh main shaamil ho chuke sunel thapa kshetra ko rajasthan main milaayaa gaya or jhalawad jile ke up jila sirnauj ko madhyapradesh ko de diya gaya
 With this, the construction or integration of Rajasthan was completed from today
 jo rajasthan ke itihaas kaa ek ati mahatti kaary tha 1 navambar 1956 ko rajpramukh kaa pad samaapt kar rajyapal kaa pad srujit kiya gaya tha

 Under marine biology, the structure, biography and nature of the oceans, plants and animals inside the seas and their coasts are studied
 aise adhyayan vaigyanik tathaa aarthik mahatv ke hote hai, jaise khaadya machhliyon ke pravaas kaa adhyayan
 The study of marine biology helps in knowing the different effects of various physical and chemical factors on the biology of marine organisms
 samudri jeev do prakaar ke hote hai - paudhe tathaa praani
 Only primitive groups Thalophyta and some angiosperms are found in the sea
 samudron main moss tathaa parnang bilkul nahin paae jate
 Most sea plants are green, brown and red algae
 shaiwal aadhaar se sanlagnak dwaara jude rahete hai
 They are found at depths of less than 50 meters
 samudri paudhon main vaastavik jaden tathaa vahinitantr nahin hote, at: ye paudhe apni saamaanya sataha se bhojan avashoshit karte hai
 Reproduction in these plants is done by microscopic spores
 inke bijaanu aspasht nar yaa maadaa paudhe main, jis yugmakodbhid peedi kehete hai, parivardhit ho jo hai
 This generation then produces a spore generation that produces spores

 Freshwater fishes have evolved from marine fishes
 sarisrup samooh ke saanp tathaa kachhue, stanpayi samooh ke hwel, samudri gaayen, sil tathaa shinshuk aadi praani samudr main paae jate hai
 To simplify the study of marine biology, the marine environment has been divided into various segments and regions
 yah vibhaajan sanyukt bhautik evam jaivik nishkarsh par aadhaarit he
 There are mainly two main regions: Nitalastha and Velapavarti
 nitalsth pradesh main taleey praani tathavelapavarti pradesh main tal se lekar samudr kii sataha tak ke praani aate hai
 These two regions can be easily distinguished from each other
 inke kai upkhand bhi kiye gaye hai
 The upper part of Nitalastha region is called Velanchali part
 velaanchali bhaag pun: do upkhandon, ulitoral tathaa sabalitoral, main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 The deep sea nitalastha body is also divided into two areas, the east nitalastha and the abyssal nitalastha region
 velaanchali kshetra ke andar ek jwarantar kshetra bhi hota he, jisamen samudr kaa tatavarti kshetra aata he
 This area is covered and covered by tides
 is kshetra ke sanlagn padap saadharantaya dhimi gati se badhanevaale tathaa lacheele hote hai, taaki ye samudri laharon se apana bachaav kar saken
 The variety of animals of the tidal range depends on the sandy or rocky variety of this region
 saadhaarant: anaachhadit chattani tat ke praani hrisht pusht hote hai
 Often these creatures have heavy edged armor and gilt-like creations
 ye rachanaayen band aasanjit kavach ko chattaanon se chipkaae rakhti hai
 In this way, these creatures are protected from the effects of sea waves and during the reflux, they also hold some water inside
 bahut se molska, nalika krimi tathaa bornekil sthaayee rup se chattaanon se jude rahete hai
 Enclosed plants are found intensively in the deep Velanchali region
 prashanth mahaasaagar ke kelp bed main 100 foot lambey mecrocystis tathaa neriocystis paae jate hai, yadhyapi adhikansh shaiwal chote hote hai
 Fascinating red algae are found in this area
 inkaa upyog egaar ke utpaadan main hota he
 Sunlight can be detected only in the shallow region of the severe marine mantle
 vitaleey kshetra main ghor andhkaar rahata he
 The water in this area would remain a bit cold
 is kshetra main mukhya bhojan kaa utpaadan nahin hota
 Thus, due to lack of staple food, the number of animals here is also less
 velapavarti kshetra main plavak tathaa taranak adhik paae jate hai
 All the water above the sea level comes in this area
 tateey jal se 200 meter tak ke jal kshetra ko neretic pradesh tathaa isse adhik gahare jal ke kshetra ko mahasaagari pradesh kehete hai
 Although the boundary separating these two regions from each other is not clear, yet they have different types of plankton and swimming pool
 udhaaharan ke liye, taleey praaniyon ke andey tathaa bachche or jelly fish kii ekal avasthaaen neretic kshetra ke vishisht asthaayee plavak hai
 Neratic diatoms produce more and more latent spores
 ye bijaanu pratikul paristhitiyon main duubakar tal main chale jate hai
 Relatively favorable conditions are found in Mahasagari region
 at: is kshetra ke paudhe neretic kshetra kii tarah supt bijaanu nahin paidaa karte
 The creatures of the Mahasagari surface are blue in color
 mahasaagari kshetra ke gahare jal main jahaan surya kaa prakaash yaa to kam rahata he yaa rahata hi nahin, praaniyon kaa rang bahudhaa laal, bhura, bangnee kaala, athwa kaala hota he
 Photogenic parts are found in animals found in depths of 300 to 350 meters, especially in fish
 ye ang vishisht pratirupon main vyavasthit rahete hai 
 Probably this helps in identifying other beings
 madhyavarti gaharaai ke neeche andhi machhliyaan tathaa squid paae jate hai
 They do not have photogenic parts

 tark kii jis prakriya main ekaaki prekshanon ke gyaat tathyon ko jodakar adhik vyapak kathan nirmit kiya jaataa he, aagamanaatmak tark kehalaata he
 This is a very different argument from 'deductive reasoning'
 prakruti ne idrandhanush ke saare rangon ko lekar unke bhadkile mishran se pashu-pakshiyon ko is prakaar susajjit kar diya he ki unhen dekh ham awak rah jate hai
 Peacocks and 'birds of paradise' are costumes of delightful colors, but Goraiya and some other birds remain brown throughout the year
 yah varna-vibhinnata kyon? varna-romaniyata aati kyon kar he? prakruti ne jantuon ko sundar bhadkile rang die hi kyon? ye prashn aise hai jinako jyon-jyon sulajhane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he tyon-tyon ulajhate jate hai
 Grant Allen wrote in his book Color Sense that animals that live on beautiful fruits and flowers, etc
, often become beautiful, and carnivorous animals, which always live in soil or a dirty place, are not colored
 yah satya he ki praaia: jantu ke rangon par vaataavaran kaa prabhaav padataa he, parantu use ek siddhant kaa rup nahin diya ja saktaa
 The armor of Ghoghas found in mud is often beautiful
 gande vaataavaran main hi rahanevaali kuch makadiyaan badi sundar hoti hai
 The discovery of the purpose of color tells us that although it is not compulsory for animals to have color, there is a huge gathering of colored animals around us
 surveykshan karne par ham is nishkarsh par pahonchte hai ki jantuon ke adbhut varna inaki suraksha se sambandhit hai
 But this conclusion does not apply to all beings
 kuch jantuon main rang anuvanshik rup main anivaary rahata he
 It has no relation with any external environment nor security
 udhaaharan ke liye, cone-shell ko lijie
 a certain pattern of color remains on the outer surface of its shell
 jab tak praani jivit rahata he yah praturup dikhalaai nahin detaa, kyonki yah bahya twachaa ko ek sthool parat se dhakaa rahata he
 After death, this color pattern starts appearing on the skin
 jivit praani kaa rang is chhipe hue praturup se kahin bhinn he
 Animals called so-animon are also of different colors
 parantu koi nahin jaanata ki itane sundar rang unhone kahan se paae
 Each type of color originates directly or indirectly from two types of liquids
 ek he melanin varnak or doosraa he vasaranji 
 Melanin is produced from blood
 yah varj padaarth he, kintu anya varj padaarthon kii tarah baahar na nikal kar twachaa, bal, pankh or shalk main ekatra ho jaataa he
 There are several types of melanin pigments, but the dark brown and black pigments are more pronounced
 pile or laal rang ke varnak vasaranji kehalaate hai
 They are pigments of fat and originate from the body's accumulated fluid
 kuch aise jantu hai jinke rang khaae gaye padaarth ke rang par aadhaarit hote hai
 These colors are called derived pigments
 titliyon kii illi ke rang isi tarah ke hote hai
 No creature can decorate its body with beautiful colors and avoid the eyes of enemies, but the creatures with low color escape from predatory animals
 is tathy kaa abhigyaan sabase pehle darwin ko hua, kintu is tathy ko purnat: pramanit or siddh karne kaa bhaar professor pulton ne apane kandhon par sambhala
 As a result, today we are familiar with many categories of colors
 inamen sabase adhik mahatvapurn shreniyan hai - Hundreds of examples of protective dyeing can be given, but none other than the resolving color of pheasant or wild duck
 jab ye purnataya gatiheen baithe hote hai, dikhalaai nahin padate
 The exact pattern of individual feathers in these birds is by no means a follow-up, as every species has its own distinct specimen, but the broad appearance seems to be of the same type and that is the veil of invisibility
 kuch pakshiyon main sarankshi ranjan sharir ke vishesh asana se sambandhit prathit hote hai
 Often these birds take such a position out of fear of fear
 praaia: bhay kii ashanka se ye pakshi aisa asana grahan kar lete hai jisase ye shatru ko dikhaai na den
 This also proves that they are conscious of the result of their body color
 bitern naamak pakshi bhay kaa sanket pate hi apni chonch ko akaash kii ore uthaae apane sharir ko urdhwadhar disha main is tarah sthir karke khadaa ho jaataa he ki uske neeche kaa bhaag shatru kii ore rahe
 The color of the underside of its body is light colored and there are black, vertical lines on the neck and chest
 dur se iskaa rang sarkande kii shakhaon ke bich se jhaankati hui prakaash kii kingranon jaisaa ho jaataa he
 As a result, it disappears at the sight of the enemy
 varna or bahya vaataavaran kii anurupata keval sampaat hi nahin he
 This is proved by many other examples
 ushn katibandheey wanon main rahanevaale mrug kaa varna puure varsh dhabbedaar bana rahata he, parantu saadhaaran jangalon main rahanevaale mrigon kaa rang garmi main dhabbedaar or sheetkaal main saadhaaran ek rang kaa hota he
 Often, the color of the wings of butterflies or fatings is protective and garish at the same time
 jaise bharat kii prasiddh titali kailima ko lijie
 It is such an important creature that changes color in the blink of an eye
 udate samay iske vistrut pankh nile rag ke rahete hai, jisapar ek sunahari pattee sushobhit rahati he
 If followed, it suddenly becomes invisible, as if the wind has passed
 achambha hota he ki hua kya or kyon? jis jhaadi ke nikat yah villin hui prathit hoti he uske paas dhyaan se dekhne par thodi der main koi ek pattee kinare par fatati hui lagegi
 Gradually, both its sides will separate and dark blue color will be seen from the middle
 is titali ke pankh ke neeche kaa rang sukhi pattee ke rang se bilkul miltaa-julata he, yahan tak ki visheshgyon ko uljhan main daal detaa he
 The same vein and the same vein is also the same
 yahan tak ki madhya bhaag main kuch dhabbe bhi dikhalaai padate hai, jo pattiyon par upasthit fafundin ke dhabbon se milte hai
 By moving downwards, the midstrate takes the shape of the leaf stalk and when the butterfly sits on the plant, it shows that the leaf is coming out of the twig
 mantis naamak kuch jantu hai, jinke sharir kii banaavat sundar phulon se milti julati he
 The Indian mind is an important example of this
 iske sharir kaa rang gulabi hota he
 The legs are flattened, so the petals resemble flowers
 yah apana sir jhukaakar is tarah baithta he ki udhar aanevaale praani ko kisi jaanavar kii upasthiti kaa bhaan tak nahin hota
 But no whip has come near that it gets stuck in its front legs
 isaki agali taange bhi vishesh rup kii hoti hai
 They are long and their front end turns into a deadly knuckle like a knife-edge
 is dhar ke kinare daantedaar hote hai, jisase koi praani ek baar fas jane par is fande se nikal nahin saktaa
 The butterfly and its relatives, considering it to be fruit, come near to it by the temptation of honey and get trapped in the trap
 kuch jaanwaron main rang badalane kii shakti hoti he
 They can change color very quickly
 rang yaa to prakashakirnon se badalte hai yaa ranjak dwaara
 Everyone must have experienced the changing colors of peacock feathers
 ek kshan vah haraa rahata he, duusare kshan nila or uske pashchaat tamra varna kaa dikhaai padataa he
 The peacock has the same color, only the analysis of the luminosities on it shows a glimpse of different colors
 girggit kii rang badalanewaali aadat se sabhi parichit hai
 On seeing this, the color of its head turns red
 kuch squid, ashtapaad or ushn pradeshy machhliyaan rang badalane main badi praveen hoti hai
 Among the fishes of the Nassau community in the sea of bermuda, there is a fish whose color is light black
 kuch kshanon main hi iskaa sharir kaali bedi dhariyon se yukt ho jaataa he
 Shining white stripes like marble remain between these stripes
 anek ushn pradeshy machhliyaan bhi yon hi rang badla karti hai
 Changing colors can also be seen in the laboratory
 in sab jaanwaron main varnak kaniyan twachaa kii bahari sataha ke ek dam neeche rahati hai
 Each pigment is made of tiny droplets of color filled in a bag of membrane
 jhilli kii in theliyon par tantrika tathaa anusevi mansapeshiyon kaa jaal failaa rahata he
 The light on the eyes stimulates these bags
 prakaash yadi tej hota he, to uskaa prabhaav gahari laal evam neeli theliyon par padataa he or yadi kam tej hota he, to uskaa prabhaav halake rang kii theliyon par padataa he
 With this effect, the muscles shrink and the pigment comes out of the bud and forms a layer
 is prakaar pataa chalata he ki rang badalane kaa kaaran aankhon par padanavala prakaash he
 The color of the body of blind fish does not change
 kuch rang shatruon ko chetavanee dene ke liye utpann hote hai
 They tell the enemy that such colored animals are tasteless or bitter
 shatrujantu ek yaa do baar anubhav karke samaj lete hai ki koun se vishesh rangavaale keede khaane yogya nahin hai, phir us rangavaale keedon par hamalaa nahin karte
 Put a lot of eggs in front of the hens with protective colored and detachable dyes
 ve kaale pile apsuchak ranjanonvale dimbhon ko chhodkar sabhi ko kha daalengi
 Detective Ranjan, in stark contrast to the protective dye, continues to warn against keeping away from animals with such a dye
 uttari america kaa stanpayi jantu skank, laal petwala tod aadi prishthvanshi praani hai, jo apni raksha ke liye apsuchak ranjan kaa prayog karte hai
 Disqualification refers to the consensual uniformity of one caste with another
 saadhaaran khai janevaali swaadisht jatiyaan apni raksha ke liye dank maaranevaali athwa beswad jati kaa anuharan karti hai
 For example, the Viceroy butterfly follows the Cuspid Monarch butterfly
 kuch fatinge bhrigon kaa or kuch makkhiyaan baren kii vibhinn jatiyon ke ranjanon kaa anuharan karti hai
 Some not only copy the dyes, but also hover over the flowers like them
 nar or maadaa ke ranjanon main praaia: antar paaya jaataa he
 This difference is very evident in birds
 inamen nar maadaa se adhik bhadkile rang kaa hota he
 The head of the hen has beautiful red crest, which is not on the head of the female
 nar kaa rang maadaa se bhadkila hota he
 a red leather pouch hangs around the male turkey's neck
 nar mor sundar rangon kii chata pradarshit karata he, par maadaa kaa rang sada hota he
 The male of the bird of paradise is famous for its unique beauty

 According to the law of nature, it is necessary for males to be beautiful in order to succeed in rivalry
