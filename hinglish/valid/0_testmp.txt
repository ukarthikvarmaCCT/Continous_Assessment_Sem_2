 panna dhai kisi rajpariwaar kii sadsy nahin thim
 Veerangana Panna Dhaya, who offered himself to the Lord of all, was born in Kameri village
 rana saangaa ke putr udaisingh ko maan ke sthaan par doodh pilaane ke kaaran panna 'dhai maan' kahalaai thi
 Panna's son Chandan and Prince Uday Singh grew up together
 udaisingh ko panna ne apane putr ke samaan paala tha
 Pannadhaya assumed the responsibility of raising a child on ascension through the collective self sacrifice of Uday Singh's mother Rani Karnavati

 He killed the descendants of Rana one by one

 Panna Dhai got the first notice of this by a trusted servant
 panna rajvansh or apane kartavyon ke prati sajag thi va udaisingh ko bachaana chaahati thi
 He put Uday Singh to sleep in a bamboo basket and covered it with false leaves and sent him out of the palace with a believing servant
 banavir ko dhokhaa dene ke uddeshy se apane putr ko udaisingh ke palang par sula diya
 Banveer came to Uday Singh's chamber with a bloodied sword and asked about it
 panna ne udaisingh ke palang kii ore sanket kiya jis par uskaa putr soya tha
 Banveer killed Panna's son as Uday Singh
 panna apni aankhon ke saamne apane putr ke vadh ko avichlit rup se dekhati rahi
 Banveer did not know why she could not even shed tears
 banavir ke jane ke baad apane mrit putr kii laash ko chumkar rajkumaar ko surakshit sthaan par le jane ke liye nikal padi

 Uday Singh grew up as a nephew of Qileadar
 teraa varsh kii aayu main mewari umaraavon ne udaisingh ko apana raja sweekaar kar liya or uskaa rajbhishek kar diya
 Uday Singh became the Statutory Maharana of Mewar in 1542
 mewar ke itihaas main jis gaurav ke saath praat: smaraneey maharana pratap ko yaad kiya jaataa he, usee gaurav ke saath panna dhai kaa naam bhi liya jaataa he, jisane swamibhakti ko sarvopari maanate hue apane putr chandan kaa balidaan de diya tha

 Imperialism is the approach according to which an ambitious nation exerts control over the natural and human resources of other countries in order to increase its power and pride
 yah hastkshep raajnneetik, aarthik, saanskrithik yaa anya kisi bhi prakaar kaa ho saktaa he
 The most obvious form of this is to take an area under its political authority and deprive the residents of that area of diverse rights
 desh ke niyantrit kshetron ko samrajya kaha jaataa he
 Under imperialist policy, a nation-state goes outside its borders and interferes with other countries and states
 samrajyavad kaa vigyansammat siddhant lenin ne viksit kiya tha
 Lenin wrote in his 1916 book "the Final Phase of Imperialism Capitalism" that imperialism is a fixed economic state that arises during the peak development of capitalism
 jin rashtron main poonjeevaad kaa charamavikas nahin hua vahaan samrajyavad ko hi lenin ne samaajawaadee kranti kii purvavela mana he
 According to Charles A
 Baird, "imperialism is the desire and policy of civilized nations to rule over weak and backward people
" " In the 15th-16th century, the era of colonial empires came as a result of geographical exploration
 is samrajyavaadee yug ko do bhaagon main baant kar adhyayan kiya ja saktaa he- purana samrajyavad or naveen samrajyavad
 The beginning of old imperialism can be traced back to around the 15th century when Spain and Portugal made a move to the region
 samrajyavad kaa yah daur 18veen shatabdi ke ant tak chalaa
 Spain and Portugal discovered all the countries and established their trading posts there
 dhire-dhire france or england ne bhi is disha main kadam badhaayaa
 The colonial empire of England became established throughout the world
 19veen shatabdi main is samrajyavad ne naveen rup dharna kiya
 After 1890 CE, imperialist sentiment emerged in a new form in the countries of Europe
 yah nav samrajyavad pehle ke upniveshwaad se aarthik or raajnneetik drushti se bhinn tha
 The old imperialism was commercialist, be it India or China or Southeast Asia
 europea vyapaaree sthaneey saudagaron se unka maal kharidte the
 European nations were not hungry for state or land, except for the protection of offices and trading centers at some places to protect the routes
 nav samrajyavad ke daur main ab suniyojit dhang se europea desh pichde ilaakon main pravesh kar un par prabhutv jamaane lage
 In these areas, he invested capital, started farming on a large scale, established minerals and other industries, developed means of communication and transportation and also intervened in cultural life
 apane prashasit ilaaka kii paramparaagat arthvyavastha or utpaadan arthvyavastha ko vinasht karke bahusankhyak sthaneey logon kii videshi maalikon par ashrith bana diya
 Colonialism and imperialism appear to have a distinct difference
 upniveshwaad, samrajyavad se adhik jatil he kyonki yah upniveshwaad ke adheen rah rahe mul nivaasiyon ke jivan par gaharaa tathaa vyapak prabhaav daalata he
 It includes the social, economic, political and cultural control of the people of the colonial power on the one hand and the people of the colonies on the one hand and the system of political rule on the imperial states on the other
 is tarah samrajyavad main mul rup se rajnatik niyantran kii vyavastha he vahiin upniveshwaad aupniveshik rajya ke logo dwaara vijit logon ke jivan tathaa samskruti par apana prabhutv sthapit karne kii vyavastha he
 While the use of military power and war is often fixed for the spread of imperialism, the use of power is not mandatory in colonialism

 European developed commercial institutions such as banks, currency systems, joint ventures, credit facilities etc

 spain ne nai duniya par apane prabhutv ko akshunn rakhane ke liye gaiyr spani vyapaariyon ke liye vahaan license jari kiye or unase atyadhik dar par chungi vasuuli
 Portugal established its colony in Brazil and began to exploit resources
 brazil main ooshna jalwaayu ke kaaran portugalio ke liye kaam karnaa kathin tha atah unhone africaiyon ko das banaakar laana armbh kiya
 Spain, Portugal and other European countries mined the mines of Peru, Bolivia, Mexico for precious metals and obtained gold and silver

 The original inhabitants had a negligible share in the profits from this export
 nai duniya ke logon se jabaran shram karavaaya gaya or virodh karne par krurtapurvak utpeedan kiya gaya
 The cultivation of sugarcane, coffee, cotton and tobacco provided many opportunities for profit for the established European traders and residents in the New World

 This slave trade linked the exploitation chain of the New World to the African continent

 This slave trade crossing the Atlantic lasted for hundreds of years
 das vyapaaree or unke gumaashte africa logon ko gulam banaakar atlantic mahaasaagar paar le jaakar bech dete the
 French, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, English were all involved in this slave trade
 yah das vyapaar trikonatmak swaroop liye hue tha
 The British obtained rum from the Caribbean islands and that rum was taken to Africa and sold, in return for a slave
 africa ke pashchimi tat se dakshin atlantic ko paar karke jamaica yaa barbados pahunch kar daason ke badale shira praapt kiya jaataa tha or yah shira ant main new england pahunchaaya jaataa tha
 Another notable example of the trade triangle is that goods manufactured in Bristol or Liverpool were taken to Africa where slaves were exchanged
 in daason ke badale main virginia se tambaakoo praapt kar ise england le jaakar mahadwipiya bazaaron main bechaa jaataa tha
 It is estimated that 85 to 90 thousand Africans were sold annually across the Atlantic under the slave trade in the 18th century
 is das vyapaar ke tahat kul 95 lakh daason ko bechaa gaya jisamen 65 lakh keval 18veen sadi ke dauraan hi beche gayi the
 In the 16th – early 17th century, the slave trade continued to be operated under the governments of various states, but later it was opened to private traders
 ye vyapaaree pashchimi africa tat par saste kapadon, dhaatu saamaanon, ram tathaa anya vastuon ke badale africa das saudagaronse maanav sansaadhan hasil karte the
 In African society, slave traders were often sold to men, women and children who were held captive due to tribal conflicts

 The profit made in the slave trade was more than 300 percent
 18 veen sadi ke ant tak europea deshon main is das vyapaar ke virodh swaroop koi pratikriya ubhar kar nahin ai
 During the 18th century, the slave trade contributed significantly to the rapid commercial growth rate of France, Britain, and the United States, causing the governments of European countries to be reluctant to abolish the slave trade
 america main to das pratha kaa mudda vahaan kii jivan style kaa ang ban gaya tha
 This is the reason why there was a conflict in North and South America over this issue

 Similarly, in America, after the Civil War, the abolition of slavery was announced

 The British East India Company in India obtained the right to recover revenue after the Battle of Plassey and Buxar
 1767 main british sansad dwaara paarit ek kanoon ke anusaar east india company ko 4 lakh pund vaarshik shahi khajaane main jamaa karana anivaary kar diya gaya
 The Indian economy and peasants were heavily exploited to meet the ever-increasing demand of the British Empire and the ambitions of the company employees
 company ke dwaara karon kii vasuuli kaa kaary thekedaaron ko saunpane se shoshan kii prakriya ko badhaava mila
 After establishing control over the Indian territory, different land revenue systems were implemented in different areas for the collection of revenue such as permanent settlement, Ryotwadi settlement and Mahalwadi settlement

 These crops were mainly tea, tobacco, cotton, sugarcane, coffee, spices etc
 in fasalon ko bone tathaa dekhibhaal karne main kisaanon kaa jo samay mehnat tathaa dhan kharch hota tha uskaa unhen koi laabh nahin miltaa tha
 This made the situation of the farmers miserable, in fact the "culture system" became the lifeblood for the Dutch government, on the other hand, the situation of the farmers of Indonesia became similar to the half-tens

 Commercialist policy was in vogue in Europe in the 17th – 18th centuries
 is niti ke tahat vyavsaay or vyapaar par kathor sarkari niyantran kaayam tha
 As the Industrial Revolution developed, the concept of non-interference policy emerged
 professor adam smith ne sarvapratham apni pustak 'velth of neshns' main mukt vyapaar kii niti kii avadharana prastut kii
 He said that the market has its own discipline, so the market should be allowed to function under the rule of demand and supply
 swatantra vyapaar se aashay vyapaarik niti kii us pranali se jo gharelu evam videshi vastuon main koi antar nahin karti or na to videshi par atirikt kar lagaaya jaataa he or na gherlu vastuon ko vishesh riyasat di jaati he
 Supporters of the policy of free trade present several arguments in its favor - swatantra vyapaar ke uparokt laabh hote hue bhi kuch arthshaastriyon kaa maananaa he ki kuch paristhitiyon main mukt vyapaar ke parinamswaroop kuch udyogon ko haani pahunch sakati he
 The following arguments can be presented in opposition to independent trade- samrajyavad apane paramparaagat swaroop main to ab lagbhag samaapt ho chukaa he parantu yah apane ek aadhunik parivesh main athwa paridhaan ke saath abhi bhi jivit he
 Traditional imperialist states, especially the western developed states and the United States, are still working to run the policies of new countries as they wish, through their policies
 shastr daud ko badhaava dekar, shastr aapurti ke dwaara videshi sahaayta ke madhyam se, vishwa aarthik sansthaaon par apane niyantran dwaara, paroksh yuddh niti, antarrashtriya sammelnon main kootneeti dwaara tathaa kai prakaar ke anya dabaav sadhano dwaara, maanav adhikaron ke raksha ke naam par, parmaanu nirastrikaran ke naam par, udaarikaran or vaishvikaran ke naam par, kam shaktishaalee yaa phir vikasshil deshon par apana prabhutv tathaa dabadabaa banaaye rakhane kii niti kaa anusaran kar rahe hai
 This is called neo-imperialism
 yah samrajyavad kaa aadhunik swaroop he
 The end of this form is now the main objective of foreign policies of developing countries
 margentho ke anusaar, jis prakaar vishesh paristhitiyon main teen prakaar ke samrajyavad hai tathaa apane lakshya ke anusaar bhi teen prakaar ke samrajyavad hote hai, usee prakaar samrajyavaadee nitiyon ke sadhano main bhi teen prakaar kii vibhinnataayen sthapit kerani chahie
 These tools are mainly called military, economic and cultural imperialism
 vastav main to sainik samrajyavad sainik vijay lakshith karata he, aarthik samrajyavad anya logon kaa aarthik shoshan tathaa saanskrithik samrajyavad ek prakaar kii samskruti kaa duusari samskruti dwaara hataaya janaa lakshith karata he parantu ye sab sadaa ek hi samrajyavad lakshya ke saadhan ke rup main kaam karte he
 Military imperialism is the most obvious, ancient and oppressive method of empire building
 sainik samrajyavad pratyaksh sainik akraman ke dwaara apane lakshya ko praapt karne kaa praytn karti he
 Hitler, Mussolini, Napoleon, Louis Fourteenth and many other rulers used this means of military victory in the modern era
 ek samrajyavaadee raashtra ke drushtikon se is paddati kaa laabh yah he ki sainik vijay ke falswaroop jo naye shakti sambandh sthapit hote hai, unhen parajeet raashtra dwaara bhadakaate hue anya yuddh dwaara hi badla ja saktaa he or is yuddh main safalataa kii sambhaavna praayah us parajeet raashtra kii utani nahin hoti, jitani samrajyavaadee raashtra kii hoti he
 Generally, war has a great importance in this kind of empire building
 sikandar, nepolian evam hitler sabhi ne samrajya nirmaan main yuddh kaa sahaara liya
 It is fitting that where war creates empire, defeat in war also leads to disintegration of empire, just as Nazi Germany started war for its imperialist goals but in the process lost its power and He even became a victim of other imperialist powers himself
 kamjor tathaa nirdhan rashtron par samrajya sthapit karne ke liye shreshth aarthik shakti kaa prayog karnaa, samrajyavad kaa sabase tarksangat saadhan he
 In Margentho's words, "economic imperialism is less ruthless and less effective than the military system in general and is the production of the modern age of gaining power as a rational means
" " aarthik samrajyavad kii niti kii aam visheshtaayen duusare rashtron par aarthik niyantran praapt karnaa he
 By economic means, imperial power controls the finances of other nations, resulting in control of policies
 udhaaharan ke liye madhya amareeki ganatantr sabhi prabhusatta sampann rajya hai parantu bahut seemaa tak unka aarthik jivan sanyukt rajya america se aayaat par nirbhar hota he
 This makes it possible for the United States to control these countries
 ye raashtra koi bhi aisi niti, chaahe gharelu niti ho yaa videsh niti, lambe samay tak lagu nahin rakh sakate, jis par sanyukt rajya america ko aapatti ho
 The economic empire is in line with today's mechanical and capitalist expansion era
 iskaa aadhunik vilakshan udhaaharan "dollar samrajyavad" he
 "oil diplomacy" is also a form of economic imperialism
 videshi nivesh, aarthik sahaayta, rin, bahurashtriya nigam, vyapaar tathaa takneekee ekadhikaar or duusare aise sadhano dwaara dhani tathaa shaktishaalee raashtra asia, africa tathaa latinap america, jinhen aam bhashaa main “teesraa vishwa” kaha jaataa he, ke nirdhan rashtron par aarthik samrajyavad hi lagu kar rahe hai
 These nations, which are providing economic aid and loans to underdeveloped nations, have their real objective behind them, to control their economy and consequently control their internal and foreign policies
 aviksit raashtra raajnneetik rup main swatantra or kanoonee taur par purna prabhusatt sampann rajya hai parantu aarthik rup main ye rajya aaj bhi dhani viksit rajyon par, jo paramparaagat samrajyavaadee shaktiyaan thim, nirbhar karte hai
 In this politically independent and economic form, dependence is called neo-imperialism and neo-colonialism
 aarthik samrajyavad nav-samrajyavad kaa mukhya upkaran he
 Military imperialism reverses power relations by military conquest and economic imperialism achieves this through economic control
 saanskrithik samrajyavad, yathapurv sthiti ko badalane kaa praytn karata he tathaa shakti sambandhon ko maanav ke mastishk par niyantran ke dwaara ulatney kaa praytn karata he
 Its aim is to control the minds of the people of other nations by the superiority of its culture, ideology and lifestyle of imperial power
 saanskrithik samrajyavad, samrajyavaadee shakti kii samskruti tathaa vichaardhaara kii shreshthata kaa pratipaadan tathaa prachaar dwaara dusron ko prabhavit karke, rajya kii shakti ko manovaigyanik saadhan dwaara vistrut karne kaa ek vilakshan tathaa sookshm saadhan he
 Neither military power nor economic pressure is used in this instrument of imperialism, but it is the most effective and permanent successful means of achieving the goals of imperialism
 saanskrithik niyantran samaaj ke us varg par hota he, jo us desh kaa shashan evam niti-nirmaataa netritv varg hota he
 Cultural imperialism generally comes as an aid to military or economic imperialism
 iskaa ek pramukh aadhunik udhaaharan he, jiskaa prayog dwitiya vishwayuddh ke purv austria main kiya gaya, jabaki vahaan najivadi sarkaar ne german phujon ko desh par kabja karne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 The Fifth Line of Nazis also achieved considerable success in France and Norway as many influential citizens within and outside the government became traitors

 Shams Tabarizi has an important place in Rumi's life, after meeting him, his shayari was filled with fun

 He was born in 604 Hijri in the famous Persian city of Balkh

 His teachings had such an impact on Rumi that he began to engage in self-discipline and spiritual practice day and night

 When his devotees and disciples saw this condition, he suspected that Shams Tabrez had cast a spell on Rumi

 Blogger has been periodically blocked in the following countries: british samudrapar pradesh yaa british videshi pradesh, united kingdom ke wo chaudaa pradesh hai, jo vaise to united kingdom kaa ek hissaa nahin hai par iske adhikaar kshetra main aate hai
 These are the territories which have been under British rule since the time of the British Empire and till date either have not attained independence or they have voted themselves to remain part of Britain
 british rashtriyata adhinium 1981 ke anusaar in pradeshon ko "british adheen kshetra" naam diya gaya tha jise british videshi pradesh adhinium 2002 ke dwaara badal kar british videshi pradesh kar diya gaya
 Prior to 1981, these territories were called Kirit colonies or Kiritopinavan
 british antarctic kshetra, jahaan par koi sthaayee nivasee nahin hai or cyprus ke samprabhu sainya addon ke alaava, sabhi videshi pradeshon main sthaayee aabaadi he
 The collective land area of all these areas is 1728000 sq km and the population is around 260,000

 bhashaa kii ek visheshta yah he ki vah sadaiv gatisheel rahati he yadi samay kabhi nahi rukta to bhashaa bhi kabhi nahin ruukti
 Then Saint Kabirdas said - Kusjjal is beautiful, Bhakha flows neer
 vastutah chetana main vyaapt anubhuti kaa bhashaa ke saath abhed sambandh he, ise is prakaar se spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 

looking up is an external linguistic experience, feeling cold is the experience of that external linguistic experience, that is, then the experience of this feeling is possible with the poet in this way - Shirir's head, Hissar filled with animals
 atah anubhav kaa anubhav yani kii anubhuti yaa ki bhashaa he
 And then accepting the Advaita form of language and cognition, the definition of poetry or composition is as follows - The experience of being experienced is poetry
 bhashaa main maanav jivan ke vividh anubhav sanchit hote hai yah manushya kaa adisarjan he, sansar kaa koi anubhav jab chetana main bimbit hota he to bhi bhashaa ke saath hota he or srujit hota he to bhi bhashaa ke saath
 Poetry or literature is based on language
 anya kalaon kii tulana main sahitya rang yaa kii sur kii bajaay bhashaa hone ke kaaran apni prakruti main bauddhik adhik he
 Thoughts and experiences are immersed in each other, whereas in other arts such as music, painting or sculpture, he has experienced primacy
 vichaar or anubhuti kii sanshlishtataa bhashaa kii visheshta he isiilie sahitya bhashaa main rachaa jaataa he
 Synthesis of thought and feeling creates meaning in literature or poetry
 is prakaar sahitya main arth kii viksonsheel prakriya chalati rahati he jo deshkal va vyakti ko chooti rahati he
 The continuous evolutionary process of poetry, whether old or new, cannot be explained with the help of definite paradigms or parameters
 pratimaanon ke aadhaar par kavita likhi nahin jaati to samajhi bhi nahin jaati vastutah kavita ko samajhnaa uski rachana prakriya kaa hi vistaar he or kavita ke arth vistaar kii yah prakriya sambhav karnaa hi aalochak kaa pradhan karm he
 When a critic is interviewed with a poem, the first experience is from the language, then with the help of language, it realizes its meaning, it is the secondary experience or experience of poetry and then it takes the base experience of the poem with the meaning of it
 The experience of secondary experience or that of experience of poetry is experience and this is the criticism in which the meaning of creation is spontaneous
 is prakaar kavy rachana or aalochana main ek drushtigat saamanjasy hota he
 Where the composition is the meaning of life, then criticism is the meaning of that creation
 ramswaroop chaturvedi : kavyanubhav ke anubhav kaa anubhav kaa yahi marm he jahaan kavita ko samajhane ke liye kavita kii samaj jaruri he na ki kisi vichaardhaara kii
 Most critical critics of the ideology elaborate on their own ideology rather than expanding the experience and meaning contained in poetry that is detrimental to poetry or literature
 pyaar kii kahani 1971 main bani hindi bhashaa kii film he
 It is often understood that the study of science and technology is possible only in English
 aisi dharna hona swaabhaavik bhi he kyonki hamaari shiksha pranali main yahi padhaaya jaataa he ki vigyaan kii padhai keval angreji main hi ho sakati he
 All the scholars of science and Hindi are found stating that it is possible to define science in English only
 bade-bade puraskaar praapt hindi ke vidwaan hindi kaa mahima mandan karte nahin thakte, lekin jab unke apane bacchon ko skool main daakhila dene kaa samay aata he, to ve angreji ke skulon ko hi praadhanya dete hai
 On the other hand, whenever scholars of science talk about science, English will dominate their tongue
 ek or tark diya jaataa he ki vigyaan kaa ugam hi pashchim kii angreji bhashaa main hua he, isliye use vigyaan keval angreji main hi padhnaa or padhaana uchit he
 It also gives the illusion of not having sufficient amount of material in the subject of science
 vikipedia par prakashit ek lekh ke anusaar hindi ke 3500 lekhak hai jo vigyaan ke vibhinn vishyon par likhte hai or aise pustakon kii sankhya 8000 ke aasapaas jo vigyaan ke vishyon par likhi gai hai
 Chandrakant Raju's book Is science born in the west? The book clearly explains how the sources of Indian ancient science which were earlier in Sanskrit, how it has been translated into English and other languages and circulated under its own name
 ab ham is vishay par vichaar karenge ki bharat main vartmaan samay kya vigyaan kii padhai hindi main sambhav he or yadi sambhav he to kis kaksha tak, kyonki vigyaan kii padhai hindi main karwaanaa to sambhav he yah kuch paalak jaanate hue bhi adhiktar paalak apane bacchon ko angreji medium skulon main isliye bhejte hai, kyonki unhen lagata he ki jab aage kii padhai angreji main hi kerani he, to bachapan se hi unhen angreji kii aadat kyon na daal den
 But the parents do not know that if their children, as a child, they will learn their mother tongue and hard subjects like science and science in Hindi, then they will increase their understanding and understand the complex concepts better
 lekin madhyamik, ucch or mahavidhyalayan tathaa vishvavidhyalayan str kii takneekee or vigyaan kii pustaken or padhai hindi main uplabdh he to phir skool or bachapan main hi angreji kaa boj ladane kii aavashyaktaa kya he
 It is better to increase the burden on children's bags and brain, they should be taught books written in mother tongue and Hindi, this will clarify their scientific thinking and also will not increase the burden of foreign language on their soft mind and intellect
 madhyamik shiksha ke baad sari padhai angreji main hone kii vajah se bhartiya vidhyaarthee hin bhaavana ke shikaar bhi hote hai, saath main unki vigyaan kii koi soch viksit nahin ho paati yaa sidhe shabdon main kahen to bachche angreji se sidhe taur par sahaj nahin ho pate hai, jisase ki unke vichaaron main moulikta kii kami ho jaati he
 After the secondary level, the language of science, engineering, medical and professional courses should be in Hindi only then science will be spread in the true sense
 hindi main vigyaan ko shaikshanik str ke saath saath rojgaar kii bhashaa bhi bananaa hoga
 It means to say that if a student studies science or engineering etc
 through Hindi medium then he should also support the market so that he can get a job
 uske saath rojgaar ke maamle main bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie
 The government will have to develop a system for this, only then Hindi will become the language of science
 isi tarah hindi main vigyaan sanchaar ko bhi rojgarparak banaate hue badhaava dena hoga
 Another advantage of this is that the degree of college and university level education which is normally 4 to 5 years can be reduced to 2 to 3 years and the time and effort required to understand English can also be avoided
 is
 bharat sarkaar ke rajbhasha niti ko karyanvit karne main bhi isse gati milegi kyonki yuvapidhi hindi main takneekee or vigyaan ke vishyon ko padhenge to unhen centre sarkaar ke karyaalayon main rojgaar praapt karne par alag se hindi prashikshan yojana ke madhyam se prabodh, praveen tathaa praajya kii kakshaon ko chalaane kii bhi aavashyaktaa nahin hogi or unhen sidhe 'paarangat' paathyakram main pravesh diya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, if the official Hindi language is implemented as a subject at the undergraduate and postgraduate level, it will also speed up the training and implementation of Official Language Hindi
 praaia: dekha gaya he ki sarkari karyaalayon main bhartee hone vaale adhiktar log apane takneekee or vigyaan ke vishyon ko angreji main padhakar aate he, isliye unhen apana kaary hindi main karne main kathinai jaati he, jiske liye aise karmchaariyon ke liye alag se prashikshan kaarykram chalaanaa padataa he, jo sirf hindi main karyalayn kaary main praveen banane ke liye hota he
 In some states of India, good results are coming out due to the study and teaching of science subjects in Hindi
 adhiktar spardhaa parikshaon main awwal aane vaale vidhyaarthee hindi madhyamon se achche ank praapt karte dikhaai de rahe hai
 Particularly complicated subjects are easy to understand in the language
 skool ke vigyaan ke saath-saath madhyamik, ucch madhyamik, mahavidhyalayan, snaatak or snatakottar ke vigyaan or takniki sambandhi vishyon kii pustaken hindi main bhi uplabdh he, jisaki jaankaree adhiktar logon ko nahin he
 Such as books related to the preparation of all branches of science, technical, engineering, polytechnics, ITI, CA, CS, CMA, computers, income tax, competition tests, books in religion, medicine, medical, nursing, medicine production, also in Hindi
 Are available rajasthan, chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, uttarakhand, uttar pradesh, bihar, dilli, punjab, haryana aadi rajyon main vigyaan vishyon kaa hindi main aasaani se padhaaya or samajhaayaa ja saktaa he
 With this, the topper can also be obtained in the competitive examination and other examinations
 emes si yti jaise computer corces main yadi bhashaa sambandhi ek adhyay jod diya jaae to computer main prashikshan praapt karte samay hi hindi or anya bhartiya bhashaaon main computer par kaary karne kaa prashikshan diya ja saktaa he

 The 190 and its variants, a newly built nameplate, were a huge success in the compact car segment by the c-class
 marcides ne 190 ke shodh or vikaas par £600 million kharch kiye or baad main kaha ki isapar 'bahut bade paimaane par ejineering' kii gai thi

 garud kashyap rishi or unki duusari patni vinata kii santaan hai
 Daksha Prajapati had two daughters named Kadru and Vinata
 un donon kaa vivaah kashyap rishi ke saath hua
 From Kashyapa Rishi, Kadru asked for one thousand Naga sons and Vinata had only two stunning sons as a boon
 vardaan ke parinamswaroop kadru ne ek hajaar andey or vinata ne do andey prasav kiye
 Kadru's eggs burst and he got a thousand snake sons
 kintu vinata ke andey us samay tak nahin phute
 Furious, Vinata burst an egg
 usamen se nikalne vaale bachche kaa upree ang purna ho chukaa tha kintu neeche ke ang nahin ban paye the
 The child got angry and cursed his mother that mother! You have broken the raw egg, so you will have to be your maid of law for five hundred years
 dhyaan rahe duusare andey ko apane se footne dena
 From that egg there will be a very bright child and he will get you free from this curse
 itnaa kahkar arun naamak vah balak akaash main ud gaya or surya ke rath kaa sarathi ban gaya One day the sight of Kadru and Vinata fell on a high horse, coming out of the sea churning
 kadru ne kaha ki us ghode kii punch kaali he jabaki vinata ne use safed rang kaa bataaya
 On this, both were conditioned that the one whose statement would be false would have to become the maid of the other
 donon shart maanakar punch dekhne chalin
 Kadru silently ordered his sons to cling to the tail, causing the tail to appear black
 vinata haar maanakar kadru kii daasi ban gayi
 In due course of time, Mahantejavi Garuda originated from the second egg of Vinata
 unki shakti or gati adwitiya thi
 One day Kadru said to Garuda that you are the son of my maid, so you take away my sons
 garud ko is par bahut krodh aayaa kintu unhone sauteli mata kii ajna maan lee
 Turning the snakes, Garuda asked them to free their mother from slavery
 is par sarpon ne kaha ki yadi tum ham logon ke liye amrit laa doge to ham tumhaari mata ko daastaa se mukt kar denge
 Garuda defeated all the gods including Indra and took away the nectar from them
 garud ke parakram se prabhavit hokar indra ne garud se mitrataa kar lee
 On becoming friends, Indra said, "friend! You give this nectar back to me, because those for whom you are taking it are naturally very wicked
 " is par garud ne kaha, "mujhe pataa he kintu main apni mata ko daastaa se mukti dilaane hetu ise unke paas le ja rahaa hoon
 You can get it back from there
 hathaat unki bhent narayan se ho gai
 Narayana, pleased with Garuda, asked him to ask for the groom
 is par garud ne sadaa unki dhwaja main bane rahane kaa var le liya
 They also became the vehicles of Narayan
 iske pashchaat garud amrit ghat ko sarpon ko dekar apni mata vinata ko daastaa se mukti dilaai
 Putting the nectar on the misrule, all the snakes went to bathe to become pure
 isi bich indra chori se us amrit ghat ko uthaa kar le gayi
 Ravana's son Meghnath fought Rama and tied Rama with Nagpash
 devarshi naarad ke kehane par garuda, jo ki sarpbhakshi the, ne nagapasha ke samast naagon ko khaakar ram ko nagapasha ke bandhan se chhudaaya
 When Rama was bound in Nagpash in this way, Garuda became suspicious when Rama was supreme
 garud kaa sandeh dur karne ke liye devarshi naarad unhen brahma ke paas bheja
 Lord Brahma told him that Lord Shankar can overcome your doubt
 bhagwaan shankar ne bhi garud ko unka sandeh mitaane ke liye kakbhushundi ji ke paas bhej diya
 Finally, Kakbhusundi ji heard the sacred story of Rama's character and removed the suspicion of Garuda

 One of the single largest purposes for lubricants, such as motor oil, is the protection of internal combustion engines in motor vehicles and electrically operated devices
 aam taur par lubricant main 90% base oil or 10% se kam yojak hote hai
 Sometimes synthetic fluids like vegetable oil or hydrogen containing polyolefins, esters, silicones, fluorocarbons and many other synthetic liquids are used as base oils
 yojakon se kam gharshan or ghisaav, vardhit chipchipahat, unnat chipchipahat suchakank, zang or oxikaran ke prati pratirodh, kalprabhaavan yaa sandushan, aadi hota he
 Lubricants like 2-cycle oil are also added to some fuels

 Non-liquid lubricants include grease, powder, teflon tape used in plumbing, air cushions and others
 Dry lubricants such as graphite, molybdenum disulfide, tungsten disulfide, provide higher temperature lubrication than the operating capacity of liquid and oil-based lubricants

 Another approach to reduce friction and wear is the use of bearings such as ball bearings, roller bearings or air bearings, which in turn require internal lubrication, or in the case of acoustic lubrication, the use of sound
 audyogic anuprayogon ke alaava, lubricant kaa kai anya prayojanon ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 Other uses include cooking, bio-medical purposes on humans, ultra-sound testing, internal testing for men and women, and the use of personal lubricants for sexual purposes
 lubricant nimnlikhit mahatvapurn kaary nishpadit karte hai
 Lubricants are typically used to separate the moving parts in a system
 isse gharshan or taap janan, parichaalan shor or kampan ko kam karne ke saath sataha shram ko kam karne kaa laabh miltaa he
 Lubricants achieve this in many ways
 sabase saamaanya he bhautik baadha ke gathan dwaara, arthath gatisheel hisson ko lubricant alag karata he
 This is called hydrodynamic lubrication
 ucch sataha ke dabaav yaa taapmaana par drav kii parat bahut patali hoti he or lubricant ke madhyam se satahon par kuch bal preshit hote hai
 This is called elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication
 aam taur par lubricant-se-sataha gharshan bina lubricant kii kisi bhi pranali main sataha-se-sataha gharshan se kam hota he
 Thus the use of lubricant reduces the friction of the overall system
 kam gharshan kaa laabh he kam taap janan or ghisne vaale kanon kaa kam gathan or saath hi unnat dakshata
 lubricant main yojak shaamil ho sakate hai jinhen gharshan sanshodhak kehete hai jo sataha ke gharshan ko kam karne ke liye rasinic taur par thos satahon ko baandhte hai, us samay bhi jab hydrodinamik lubrication ke liye aparyaapt thok lubricant maujuud ho, udaa

 Both gas and liquid lubricants can transfer heat
 tathaapi, taral lubricant apane ucch vishisht taap kshamta ke kaaran or adhik prabhavi hai
 Generally, the liquid lubricant operates in and out of the cooler part of the system, although lubricants may be used for heating and cooling when a controlled temperature is required
 This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that goes away in the unit at a given time
 ucch pravaah pranaliyaan bahut zyada garmi le ja sakati hai or lubricant par thermal tanaav ko kam karne kaa atirikt laabh bhi uthaa sakati he
 In this way low-cost liquid lubricants can be used
 praathmik dosha yah he ki ucch pravahon ke liye aam taur par vishaal haudi or bade shitalan ekakon kii aavashyaktaa he
 a minor drawback is that the high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure upon sudden system shutdown
 ek automotive oil-kuld terbo charger ek theth udhaaharan he
 Turbochargers become hot red during operation and the oil that cools them remains because their time in the system is very short ie high flow rate
 If the system is stopped abruptly, the oil in the turbo charger is immediately oxidized and will block the oil passages including deposits
 These deposits can completely block the oil passages, reducing cooling over time, resulting in a complete shutdown of the turbo charger, usually with jam bearings
 greez or paste jaise pravaahit na hone vaale lubricant taap antaran ke samay prabhavi nahin rahete hai, haalanki pehle to ve taap janan ko kam karte hue yogadan dete hai
 Lubricant transmission systems have the advantage of taking away internally generated debris and external contaminants coming into the system, which reach the filter from where they can be removed
 mashiinon ke liye lubricant jo niyamit rup se malbe yaa dooshit padaarth janit karte hai jaise ki automotive ingine, aam taur par inamen malba or dooshit padaarthon ko filter tak pahunchane or hataane ke liye disergent or chhitare hue yojak shaamil hote hai
 Over time the filter will fill up and need to be cleaned or replaced, so it is recommended that you change the oil filter while changing the oil in the car
 In closed systems such as gear boxes, the filter may include a magnet supplement to attract the fine iron shreds generated
 yah spasht he ki ek sanchaar pranali main tel keval utana hi saafe ho saktaa he jitna ki filter use bana saktaa he, is prakaar yah durbhagyapurna he ki koi udyog maanak maujuud nahin hai jinase upabhokta sugamawa se vibhinn automotive filtaron kii chaanane kii kshamta kaa moolyankan kar saken

 The Romans used rags dipped in animal fat to lubricate the wheels of the wagon; However, the science of lubricating really only progressed with the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century
 aam taur par lubricant apekshit visheshtaon ke liye zyaada base oil or thode yojakon ke saath bane hote hai
 Gaseous lubricants have much lower viscosity and greater compression than liquid lubricants, but liquid-membrane principles apply homogeneously to gases
 gasiy lubricanton ke kuch udhaaharan hai hawa, takneekee gaisen, bhaap yaa drav-dhaatu vaashp
 The symptoms of liquid lubricants can be described in many different ways

 Coins are used as money in a variety of transactions, from the transmission of everyday coins to the storage of large numbers of bullion coins
 aajkal ke maujuuda leneden main aadhunik paise kii pranali main sikke or banknote nakad ke rup main upyog kiye jate hai
 Coin is used to pay bills and is usually monetized for lower units' values and banknotes for higher values; In many money systems, the highest-value coin is worth less than the lowest-value banknote
 pichley sau varshon main, parisancharan sikke kaa ankit mulya aamtaur par unhen banane main istemaal dhaatu ke kul mulya se adhik hota he, lekin aam taur par sikke ke parisancharan ke itihaas main aisa hameshaa nahin hua he, kai baar parisancharan sikke keemtee dhaatuon se banaae gaye hai
 With the exception that the face value of the coin exceeds the total value of the metal used, many times "bullion coins" are made with the intention of collecting or investing in silver and gold, precious metals

 Currently most coins are made from base metal and their value comes as a condition of their official money
 iskaa matlab yah he ki sikke ke mulya kaa aadesh sarkari aadhikarik detaa he or is prakaar antarrashtriya vyapaar antarpanan main yah rashtriya mudraon ke rup main mukt bazaar dwaara nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 This is why coins, like paper currency, are also similar to monetary tokens, whereas paper currency is not directly supported by the metal but is guaranteed by the government for international exchange of goods or services

 However, some numismatists consider the coins to be around 600-550 BC
 Originating in Anatolia, especially in the Anatolia state of Lydia that corresponds to modern-era Turkey

 So mainly because the evidence of the dates of these coins depends on archeology, the excavations cited the most evidence from the temple of Artemis of Ephesus, also known as the Ephesian Artemisians
 The fact that the old lion-headed coins discovered in the temple and the fact that they were not commercially used emphasized the scenario that the coins found were used for medals and medallions and that of Artemis Were issued by the priests of the temple, the names of persons receiving medals or medals were inscribed on it
 anatolia ke aratimis kaa naam potnia theron rakhaa gaya tha jiskaa anuwaad he "jaanwaron kii malkin" or uskaa pratik tha sher or baagh

 According to Herodotus, this Phineas was buried alive in a sandstorm with 50,000 Persian soldiers, while trying to conquer the amun-zeus temple in Egypt
 tathy yah he ki greek shabd "phaness" kaa arth prakaash bhi he or "seemaa" kaa matlab he kabr ne is sikke ko prasiddh or vivaadaaspad bana diya
 Another possible applicant of the first metal coin is from China
 praarambhik gyaat chini dhaatu ke token lagbhag 900 isa purv main banaae gaye the, jo aanyang ke paas ek kabr main paae gaye the
 These were replicas of early Chinese money made of bronze, the Kaur shell hence the name Bronze
