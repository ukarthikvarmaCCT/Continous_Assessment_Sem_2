1967 main aranon ne bataaya ki chloroplast main paayi jane vaali protein farrodoxin prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main mukhya kaary karti he
 It is recognized by all scientists in the modern era that in oxygenation, free oxygen comes from water
 aadhunik samay main anek prayogon ke aadhaar par yah siddh ho chukaa he ki prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya nimna do charnon main sampann hoti he
 In the first stage, the light process or the hill process or the photochemical process
 or duusare charan main andheri prakriya athwa blekaman prakriya yaa prakashahin prakriya
 In the process of photosynthesis, both processes take place after each other
 prakaash prakriya andheri prakriya kii upeksha adhik teji se hoti he
 Photosynthesis occurs in all chloroplast-containing cells of the plant
 arthath paudhe ke samast hare bhaagon main hoti he
 This action occurs especially in the mesophyll tissue of the leaves because the parenchyma cells of the mesophyll tissue of the leaves have a greater amount of chloroplast than other cells
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main jo prakriya prakaash kii upasthiti main hoti he use prakaash kriya ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 This activity was studied by other scientists like Hill
 prakaash prakriyaaon ke samay andheri prakriyaayen seemaabaddh kaarak kaa kaary karti hai
 Lighting processes take place in two stages, photolysis and placement of hydrogen
 photolysis kii prakriya main prakaash chlorophyl ke anu dwaara photone ke rup main avashoshit kii jaati he
 When the chlorophyll molecule absorbs one quantum of light, the second molecule of chlorophyll does not absorb the light until the first energy is used in the process of photosynthesis
 chlorophyl dwaara is prakaar shoshit prakaash kaa photone ucch urja str par ek electron nikaalati he tathaa yah shakti phosphate ke tisare band par sthit hokar ucch urja vaale adinosine tryphosphate ke rup main prakat hote hai
 Thus Chloropil produces ATP in the presence of light and this process is called phosphorylation
 is prakaar surya ke prakaash kii urja atipi arthath rasinic urja main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Thus, the ATP produced in the chlorophyll molecule is helpful in many chemical reactions such as CO2 being deoxidized into sugars, separated from the chlorophyll molecule
 chlorophyl is atipi ko swatantra karne par phir akriy ho jaataa he
 According to Van Neil Frank, Wishnik, when water comes into contact with this functional chlorophyll, the water is dissected in unoxidized h and strong oxidizing OH
 chlorophyl + prakaash → sakriy chlorophiliah2o + sakriy chlorophyl → H+ + oh-is photolysis prakriya main O2 pani se swatantra ho jaati he tathaa hydrogen bhi hydrogen graahak par chali jaati he
 2H2O + 2A → 2AH2 + O2 Thus all the oxygen released from the photosynthetic activities of plants is derived from water
 hill, ruben ne iskaa samarthan kiya tathaa O18 kaa prayog karke isko siddh kiya
 The release of oxygen from water was shown to be in the absence of CO2 in an algae called chlorilla
 iskaa arth hua ki CO2 kii anupasthiti main oxygen kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he, parantu isamen hydrogen graahak hona chahie
 It has been observed that NADP forms two NADPH2 in plants
 2H2O+2NADP=2NADPH2+O2 According to Aranan, light action is mainly related to construction
 NADPH2 / NADP ke avkaran se banataa he
 NADP is also known as TPN
 atipi ek prakaash urja anu he jo edipi main ek phosphate group ke judane se banataa he tathaa is kriya ko phosforilation kehete hai
 Phosphorylation of ADP requires light energy, so it is also called photo-phosphorylation
 yah bhi ek jatil kriya he tathaa aranan ke anusaar prakaash prakriya do prakramon main hoti he
 Combination photo-phosphorylation and Pair photo-phosphorylation In the photo-phosphorylation, electrons are continuously obtained due to the decomposition of water and ATP is produced by light energy in chlorophyll on the action of photo-phosphorylation
 is prakaar chlorophyl ‘a’ ke sakriy hone par pheredoxin electron grahi kaa kaary karti he jise enedipi naamak coenzyme ko detaa he jisamen enedy pani dwaara mukt kii gai hydrogen ko pakad kar NADPH2 main parivartit ho jaataa he
 In this way, the free electrons dissolved in water are excited at chlorophyll 'b' and reach a higher energy level, and these electrons are again obtained by the type chlorophyll 'a', it is not fully known but it is believed That the electron receptor called plastokavinone captures these electrons which then revert to chlorophyll 'a' by the cytochrome
 isamen saath-saath atipi kaa bhi nirmaan hota he
 In the process of pair photo-phosphorylation, chlorophyll 'a' is activated by sunlight and throws electrons out which are captured by the ferridoxine present in chlorophyll
 yahi electron mukt hokar plastoquinon naamak electron grahi dwaara pakad liya jaataa he
 In the middle of this action, ADP is converted to ATP and the electron is released again and goes back to the chlorophyll 'a' via the cytochrome wicker
 is kriya main bhi edipi, atipi main parivartit ho jaataa he
 External electrons are not used in this activity and the electron comes out of chlorophyll and comes back there again
 is prakaar ayugma va yugma prakriyaaon dwaara pani vighatit ho jaataa he jisase oxigen gas swatantra ho jaati he tathaa hydrogen, hydrogen grahi enedipi dwaara pakad lee jaati he tathaa saath hi saath urja bhi vargeekrut ho jaati he jiskaa prayog rasinic prakriya yaa aprakashiya pratikriya main hota he
 Oxygen and photosynthesis is prakriya ke liye prakaash kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 Carbon dioxide is often degraded in this process
 is prakriya main pattee ke stomata dwaara grahan kii gai carbondioxide, pani se nikali hydrogen prakaash kii urja ke kaaran milakar ek sthaayee dravya banaata he
 CH2O, it is a unit molecule of carbohydrates
 kelvin va banson ne radio isotopic takanic kaa prayog kar bataaya ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii prakriya main pehla sthai yogic ek 3 carbon vaala 3-phosphoglicerick amla banataa he
 Photosynthesis was carried out briefly in the presence of radioactive C14O2 in algae called Chlorolla and Syndesmus, and these also formed the first stable liquid phosphoglyceric acid
 yah phosphoglicerick amla baad main glucose banaata he
 Thus it was proved by the work of Calvin and his colleagues that CO2 is converted into glucose in the photosynthesis process
 unhone is prayog main carbon ke samasthanik kaa prayog kiya
 Chlorophyll contains ribulose-1,5 visphosphate
 ab vayumandaleey CO2 pattee ke stomata dwaara pravesh kar andar pahunchati he tathaa turant hi ribuloj-1,5 visphosphate ke saath milakar ek asthai yogic kaa nirmaan kati he
 The temporary compound thus formed, which is 5-carbon sugar, soon breaks down into 2 molecules of phosphoglyceric acid
 ab yahaan par NADPH2 dwaara hydrogen mukt kiye jane par pijie ko pijieel main parivartit kar detaa he
 Energy is obtained from ATP in this activity
 is prakaar CO2 se carbohydrates nirmaan ho jate hai
 In the dark process of photosynthesis, plants in which the first permanent compound phosphoglyceric acid is formed are called C3 plant
 phosphoglissrik amla ek 3 carbon vaala yogic he isliye in paudhon kaa aisa namakaran he
 The plants in which the first permanent compound forms a compound of 4 carbons are called C4 plants
 saadharantah 4 carbon vaala yogic oxaloecetic amla banataa he
 It was previously believed that only C3 or Calvin cycle occurred during the stabilization or fixation of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, that is, the first stable compound is phosphoglyceric acid
 lekin 1966 main hech evam slack ne bataaya ki carbondioxide ke sthirikaran kaa ek doosraa path bhi he
 He studied in sugarcane, maize, amaranthus, etc
 that phosphoinol pyruvic acid, which is a 3-carbon specific compound, combines with carbon dioxide to form 4-carbon-specific compound oxaloacetic acid
 is kriya main phosphoinol piruveet carboxillage injim utprerak kaa kaary karata he
 There are four main components in the process of photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, light and foliage
 in chaaron kii upasthiti is kriya ke liye ati aavashyak he
 Of these, water and carbon dioxide are called raw materials for photosynthesis because the main products of photosynthesis are the formation of carbohydrates by their creative ingredients
 in avyavo ko paudha apane aas-paas ke vaataavaran se grahan karata he
 Carbon dioxide is a major component and raw material of photosynthesis
 vayumandal main carbondioxide gas shwasan, dahan, kinvan, vighatan aadi kriyaaon ke dwaara mukt hoti he
 Its volume in air is 0
03% to 0
04%
 sthaliy paudhe ise sidhe hi vaayu se grahan kar lete hai
 The leaves of these plants have small holes called parnandhra
 carbondioxide inhen parnarandhron se paudhe kii pattiyon main pravesh karti he
 Submerged plants ingest carbon dioxide dissolved in water by diffusing it from their physical surface
 jal main carbondioxide kaa strot jaleey jantu hai, jinke shwasan main yah gas utpann hoti he
 The decomposition of carbonate and bicarbonate present in the underwater rocks also produces carbon dioxide which aquatic plants consume in photosynthesis
 prakaash-sanshleshan main glucose naamak carbohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he
 In this, carbon and oxygen atoms are obtained from carbon dioxide
 chlorophyl chlorophyl ek proteinous jatil rasinic yogic he
 It is the main pigment of photosynthesis
 chlorophyl e tathaa chlorophyl bi do prakaar kaa hota he
 It is found in chloroplasts of all autotrophic green plants
 chlorophyl ke anu surya ke prakaashiya urja ko avashoshit kar use rasinic urja main roopaantarit karte hai
 Chlorophyll molecules are excited by absorbing the Sun's optical energy
 ye sakriy anu jal ke anuon ko H+ tathaa OH- aayan main vighatit kar dete hai
 Thus chlorophyll molecules initiate the biochemical activity of photosynthesis
 prakaash surya kaa prakaash prakaash-sanshleshan ke liye aavashyak he
 Photosynthesis also takes place in the intense artificial light of bulbs etc
 laal rang ke prakaash main yah kriya sabase adhik hoti he
 This action is most common in red after purple
 ye donon rang chlorophyl dwaara sarvaadhik adhik maatra main avashoshit kiye jate hai
 The green color reflects chlorophyll completely, so photosynthesis stops completely in every color
 jal jal prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya kaa kaccha maal he
 Terrestrial plants absorb it from soil by root roots
 jaleey paudhe apane jal ke sampark vaale bhaagon kii bahya sataha se jal kaa avasorana karte hai
 Uprooting plants such as orchids absorb atmospheric water vapor through their pneumatic roots
 prakaash-sanshleshan ke prakaashiya abhikriya main jal ke prakaashiya vighatan se oxigen utpann hota he
 This oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct
 adheri abhikriya main banane vaali glucose ke anuon main hydrogen tatv ke anu jal se hi praapt hote hai
 Water also performs indirect functions during photosynthesis
 yah jeevadravya kii kriyasheeltaa tathaa injime kii sakriyata ko banaae rakhata he
 Photosynthesis is affected by many factors
 iske kuch kaarak bahya hote hai tathaa kuch aantarik
 Additionally there are some limiting factors
 bahya kaaran ve hote he jo prakruti or paryaavaran main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan ko prabhavit karte hai jaise prakaash, chunki surya ke prakaash se paudha is kriya ke liye urja praapt karata he tathaa andhere se yah kriya sambhav hi nahin he
 Carbon dioxide, because it has been observed that if all other factors are obtained in the highest amount by the plant and the amount of CO2 is gradually increased in the atmosphere, the rate of photosynthesis also increases
 taapmaana, kyo ki dekha gaya he ki paudhon main prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ke liye ek nishchit tapakram kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he tathaa jal, pani photochemical prakriyaaon ke atyant aavashyak he or yah is kriya ke samay anek rasinic parivartanon main sahyog karata he
 Internal causes are those that affect the action of photosynthesis by being located in the leaves, such as foliage or chlorophyll by which light energy is converted into chemical energy
 praras / jeevadravya / puras yaa protoplasm jisamen paae jane vaale vikar prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai
 The deposition of food, because if the food produced in the process of photosynthesis continues to accumulate in the local cells, the rate of photosynthesis slows down
 pattiyon kii aantarik sanrachana kyon ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar pattiyon main upasthit stomata yaa randhron kii sankhya tathaa unke band evam khulne ke samay par nirbhar karti he
 Age of leaves, as new leaves have higher rates of photosynthesis of older leaves
 iske atirikt prakaash sanshleshan ko in sabhi vastuon kii alag-alag gati bhi prabhavit karti he
 When an action of photosynthesis is controlled by various factors, the speed of photosynthesis is controlled by the slowest factor
 prakaash, carbondioxide, jal, chlorophyl ityadi main se jo bhi uchit pariman se kam pariman main hota he, vah puri kriya kii gati ko niyantrit rakhata he
 This factor is called time-bounded factor

 Optical energy is used in the presence of foliage and oxygen is released as a by-product
 prakaash sanshleshan ek anksikaran - avkaran prakriya he jisamen jal kaa prakaashik oxikaran tathaa CO 2 kaa aprakashik avkaran hota he or carbonic yogic banate he tathaa oxygen mukt hoti he
 Mechanism of Photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is a very complex process, which is mainly carried out in two terms - 1 optical reaction and 2 unpublished reactions, 1
 Optical Reaction - In order to harness the energy of sunlight and to make hydrogen available by the dispersion of water, these activities take place in the presence of light in the particles called grana inside the green lantern
 in kanon main parnaharim yaa chlorophyl naamak padaarth hota he
 These actions can be summarized as follows: The radiation energy of sunlight activates the chlorophyll molecules and expels the energetically excited electrons
 sakriy chlorophyl se aavashyak urja praapt kar jal ke anuon kaa vichchhedan hota he jisase hydrogen tathaa anxigen praapt hoti he|agar aapako bhi ganit lagati he acchhee to aapkaa bhavishya he ujjwal, jane kaise? uttejit elevatron ek vishesh tantra, jise elevatron sthaanantaran tantra kehete he, ke dwaara apni urja de dete he
 This energy is stored in ADP molecules by leaving a phosphate group and leaving
 praapt anxizan paudhe se baahar nikal jaati hai
 The hydrogen obtained is collected by the receptor material called NADP
 isamen NADP
H 2 kaa nirmaan hota he

 Unpublished Reaction - Light is not required for these actions
 in abhikriyaaon ko inaki khoj karne vaale vaigyanik ke naam ke aadhaar par bluecoman abhikriyaayein kehete hai
 These actions take place in the pelvic or stroma of the larynx
 in samast kriyaaon ko, jo ek vishesh padaarth ribulos biphosphate kii upasthiti main ek chakra ke rup main hoti he, calvin chakra bhi kehete hai
 In a nutshell, these reactions can be expressed as follows: In the presence of certain substances, CO 2 obtained from the atmosphere is degraded from h + of NADP
H 2 obtained from optical activity and forms a substance called PGAL
 in kriyaao main agralikhit abhikriyaayein sammilit he- 5 carbon vaale yogic rubp ke saath carbon dianksaide ke anu milakar ek 6 carbon asthaayee yogic kaa nirmaan karte he- yah asthaayee yogic sheeghra hi apachayit hokar va tuutakar do anu PGA bana letaa he
 It is a three-carbon compound - PGA molecules subsequently become more reduced, forming PGAL
 PGAL ke do anu milakar tathaa apchayan ke dwaara phosphate sharkara kaa tathaa baad main sharkara kaa nirmaan kar lete hai
 PGAL itself can also act like food
 yah teen carbon parmaanu vaala yogic he
 Its two molecules combine to form one molecule of glucose
 glucose se hi anya sabhi prakaar ke bhojya padaarthon, jaise - protein, vasa, mand ityadi kaa nirmaan bhi paudhe ke andar hi ho jaataa he
 In the Calvin cycle, PGAL and its products also regenerate ribulose biphosphate, which means that it is remodeled to run the reactions of the cycle

 Almost all the objects in the universe are constantly changing - the stars change from us, the star's light fluctuates, the planets' axial tilt changes, etc
 - so it is necessary that whenever a measurement of an object is given So make it clear for what time that measurement was true

 Anukravrata means miniature
 jain dharm ke anusaar shravak, anuvraton kaa paalan karte hai
 'mahavrata' is made for sages
 yahi anuvrat or mahavrath main antar he, anyathaa donon samaan hai
 Anubhavratas are said to be smaller than the Mahavratas of sages
 mahavraton main sarvatyag kii apeksha rakhte hue sookshmata ke saath vraton kaa paalan hota he, jabaki anu vraton kaa sthulata se paalan kiya jaataa he
 According to Mahavira, there are five atavavratas - Ahimsa, Satya, Astaya, Brahmacharya and Aparigraha
 naitikta shunya dharm ne dharmik kattarta ko badhaava diya
 Religion became secondary, cults became predominant
 apeksha yah he ki dharm mukhya rahe or sampradaay gaun hon
 In this context, Anuwrat gave a new approach
 usne sampradaay mukt dharm ki avadharana di
 Anukravrata is only religion, not that community
 kisi sampradaay vishesh kaa pratinidhi bhi nahin he
 It is not Jainism, Buddhism, Vedic, Islam and Christianity
 is drashti se ise ek nirvisheshan dharm yaa maanav dharm kaha ja saktaa he
 According to Anukravrata, one cannot be religious without being moral
 upasna dharmaradhana kaa madhyam he
 According to Anukavrata, the place of worship is the second and the first of religion
 anu kaa arth he chota or vrath kaa arth he -sanskaar
 The literal definition of Anukravrata is the same, but its spirit is widespread
 uske anusaar kisi chote se chote praani se bhi anaavashyak hinsa na kii jaae
 The criterion of morality based on the molecule is moderation
 sanyam atmamukhi bhi he tathaa samajabhimukhi bhi he
 Restraining your senses is also self-oriented, it can also be moral
 anuvrat kaa mul mantra he 'sanyamh khalu jeevanam' arthath sanyam hi jivan he
 It means that moral action is where there is restraint
 iske anusaar jis kaary main saath sanyam nahin he, us kaary ko kabhi naitik nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The director elements of Anukravrata are as follows: anuvrat ke anusaar ichha badhanaa acha nahin he kyonki icchhaaen anant hoti he or anant icchhaaen dusron ke adhikaar kaa hanan karti hai or vyakti ko krur bana detii he
 The goal of Anukravrata is the restraint of desires
 anuvrat kaa teesraa aadhaar he karunaa
 According to Anukravrata, for a person who has compassion, the suffering of others will become unbearable
 vah apane aacharnon ke dwaara kisi ke prati krur nahin banegaa, apitu apane aapako bhi is tarah se dhaalega ki kisi anya ko koi ksht nahin ho
 This goal will always be in front of him- iskaa arth he: koi bhi vyakti dukhi na bane, sab sukhi or niramay bane
 Welfare of all
 aisa vyakti kisi ke saath chalanaa nahin kar saktaa
 Anuwrat was started by Acharya Tulsi on 1 March 1949 in Sardarshahar town of Rajasthan

 The difference that is visible is either due to solitary solicitation or it is being emerged due to communal interests
 is drashti se vishaal sarv dharm sadbhaav sammelan yojit kiye gaye or anuvrat kaa manch ek sarvadharm sadbhaav kaa pratik ban gaya
 Apart from the Indian religious communities, a meaningful dialogue was also formed with the Christian and Muslim communities, and many Christians and Muslims also showed interest in propagation of Anuwrat
 jagadguru shankaracharya, dalai lamas, isai padri, musalmaan santo ne bhi isamen bhaag liya
 Anuwrat is a versatile campaign

 maharishi agastya kaa mandir pahaad se neeche agastyamuni naamak nagar main he
 According to the belief, the priest of the Agastyamuni temple had died many years ago, due to which the worship was stopped there
 isi samay dakshin se koi do aadmi jo ki uttrakhand kii yatra par aaye huye the, agastya rishi ke mandir ke bare main pataa lagane par mandir main darshan ko aaye
 The local people forbade them not to go inside the temple, the worship is closed and the person who is going inside is dying
 unhone kaha ki agastya rishi to hamaare devtaa hai, ham to darshan karenge hi 
 He went in, saw and if nothing happened to him, the local people requested him to maintain the worship system in the temple itself
 iske baad ve basane hetu sthaan khojane upar pahaad par gayi, vahaan ek sthaan par unhone chuuhe tathaa saanp ke bich ladaai hote dekhi, antatah chuuhe ne saanp ko haraa diya
 Seeing this, he decided that there is strength and accomplishment in this place and it is suitable for living

 Early drafts of his screenplay include Wheaton as the narrator of Steve Trevor, which causes a fierce battle between Diana and her mother, and Diana's helpless Diana in the modern world after Diana leaves Themyscira Island Rescues again and again
 haalanki, wheaden apni patakatha ke antim sanskaran ko puraa nahin kar paae, or phir 2007 main unhone is pariyojna ko chhod diya
 Although Whidden stated in May 2005 that he would not choose an actress for Wonder Woman until the script was over, Kate Beckinsale joined the film a short time later
 haalanki 2010 main, wheaden ne sweekaar kiya ki unke dimag main is bhoomika ke liye ek abhinetri hai, jab unhone kaha ki "vander vuman mul rup se angelina joli thi
 "A few years later in May 2017, Indie Ground Films leaked a version of Wheeden's screenplay online
 pati jenkins ke film ke sanskaran ke relies ke kuch hi samay baad, june 2017 main soshal media par logon ne is patakatha par nakaaratmak pratikriyaaain vyakt kii thi
 When Jenkins was asked about this screenplay in an interview in June 2017, he said he had not read it and Wheedon "is now in the DC Universe, and i don't think there's any need to go there as it was, Was like that
 main bhaagyashaalee hum ki mujhe yah karne ke liye mila he
 But i do not think that what they would have done, or what i did, is of any benefit in comparing these two
 " The day before Wheeden's departure from Wonder Woman, Warner Bros
 and Silver Pictures purchased a specific screenplay for the film, written by Matthew Jennison and Brent Strickland
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan set is patakatha ne silver pikchars ke adhikariyon ko prabhavit kiya
 However, Silver stated that he had bought the script because he did not want to withdraw the rights; While the script had good ideas, the Silver ones did not want Wonder Woman to be a period film

 is baar film kii patakatha alan henberg dwaara likhi jaani thi, jo henberg, zake snyder, joff jones or jesan fookes dwaara sah-likhit ek kahani par aadhaarit thi
 Regarding this version of Wonder Woman, Gadt stated that, lambey samay tak, logon yah hi nahin samaj paae the ki kahani kaa drushtikon kya rakhen
 When Patty and i had a conversation about the creation of this character, we realized that Diana could be a normal woman who has high ideals, but still, she is a woman

 She is smart and independent and emotional

 The construction or use of an instrument is for the purpose of extracting the sound of music

 However, most historians believe that it is impossible to determine a specific time of the invention of the instrument, being subjective to the definition

 Scholars agree that there is no completely reliable way of determining the exact chronology of instruments in different cultures
 unki jatilta ke aadhaar par vaadyayantron kii tulana or unka aayojan bhraamak he, chunki vaadyayantron main hone vaale vikaas ne kabhi-kabhi jatilta ko kam kiya he
 For example, the construction of early slit drums involved harvesting and hollowing out huge trees; Later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stems, which was quite easy
 isi prakaar kaarigari ke aadhaar par vaadyayantra ke vikaas ko yojit karnaa bhraamak he, chunki sabhi samskritiyaan vibhinn staron par vikaas karti hai or unhen alag-alag samagriyaan uplabdh hoti hai
 For example, anthropologists attempting to compare instruments created by two cultures that existed at the same time, which differed in their formation, culture, and handicraft, could not determine which instruments were more "primitive"

 The German music scientist, Kurt Sax, who is the most prominent music scientist and anthropologist of modern times, suggests that a geographical chronology dating to about 1400 is better, as it is limited subjectively
 1400 ke upar, samyavadhi ke aadhaar par vaadyayantra ke samgr vikaas ko liya ja saktaa he
 The science of marking the sequence of development of instruments is dependent on archaeological crafts, artistic notation and literary references
 chunki kisi ek anusandhan maarg main aankade adhure ho sakate hai, sabhi teen maarg ek behatar aitihaasik tasviir uplabdh karaate hai
 European music history, written until the 19th century, begins with these mythological descriptions of how instruments were invented
 aise vivaranon main shaamil he jubaal, can ke vanshaj or "un sabhi kaa pita jo harp or organ sambhalate hai", paan, panpipe ke avishkaarak or marakari, kaha jaataa he jisane kachhue ke sookhe khol se pehla lahore banaaya tha
 Modern history has replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation and is sometimes corroborated by archaeological evidence

 For example, a Homo Habilis slapping his body could be an under-construction instrument regardless of its intent

 The early cultures for which drums developed ritualistic and even sacred significance are the Chukchi people of Far Eastern Russia, the native people of Melanisia, and many cultures in Africa
 In fact, in every African culture, drums were widely present
 ek purvi africa janajati, vahinda ise itnaa pavitra maanati thi ki sultan ke alaava ise dekhne vaale kisi anya vyakti ke liye yah ghaatak hota tha
 Eventually humans developed the concept of using instruments to produce melodies
 vaadyayantra ke vikaas main is samay tak, raag, sirf gayan main hi aam tha
 Similar to the process of repetition in language, instrumentalists first developed repetition and then instrumentalization
 An early form of melody was produced by banging tubes of two different sizes - one tube produced a "clear" sound and the other produced a "deep" sound
 aise yantron ke jode main bullrorer, slit drum, sip turahiyaan or khaal drum bhi shaamil he
 Cultures that used pairs of these instruments linked gender with them; The "father" was a larger or more energetic device, while the "mother" was a smaller or slower device
 sangeet ke vaadyayantra hazaron varshon tak is rup main bane rahe, jab tak ki praarambhik zylophone ke rup main, sur ke teen yaa usase adhik pattern kaa vikaas nahin hua
 Xylophone originated in the mainland and archipelago of Southeast Asia and from there it spread to Africa, America and Europe
 Along with the xylophone, which ranged from a simple three "leg bar" set to a carefully tuned set of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the Bhumi Veena, Bhumi Jithar, musical Dhanush and Jau Harp

 Despite this development, very few instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia main vaadyayantron ke praarambhik itihaas ko phir se sangathit karne ke liye vidwaanon ko sumerion yaa acadian main likhi kalakritiyon or keelakaar lekh par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Even the process of naming these devices is challenging since there is no clear distinction between the various tools and the words used to define them
 haalanki, sumerian or babylon ke kalakaaron ne mukhya rup se samarohik vaadyayantron kaa ankan kiya he, itihaaskaar, chah ideophone ke bich bhed karne main sakasham hue hai jo aarambhik mesopotamia main istemaal kiye jate the: kanakashan club, claper, sistra, ghantiyaan, simbal or jhunjhuna

 People began writing books about the making, playing and cataloging of instruments; The first such book was Sebastian Firdung's 1511 treatise Musica getuscht und angezogen

 All methods examine some combination of the physical properties of the instrument, how the music is performed on the instrument, and the position of the instrument in the orchestra or other musical groups
 kuch tareeke, visheshgyon ke bich is asahmati ke parinamswaroop utpann hote hai ki vaadyayantron kaa vargeekaran kaise kiya janaa chahie
 While a complete survey of classification systems is beyond the scope of this article, a summary of the major systems is as follows
 ek pracheen pranali, jo kam se kam 1 shatabdi i
pus
 se chali aa rahi he, vaadyayantron ko chaar mukhya vargeekaran samoohon main vibhajit karti he: ve upkaran jahaan dhwani taar hilaane se utpann hoti he; ve vaadyayantra jahaan dhwani hawa ke khandon ke kampan ke dwaara utpann hoti he; lakdi yaa dhaatu ke bane parakashan vaadyayantra; or chamade ke mukh vaale parakashan upkaran yaa drum

 Erik von Hornbostel and Kurt Sax later took the ancient method and in 1914 published a comprehensive new scheme for classification in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie
 unki paddati ko aaj vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he or ise aksar hornbostel-sacks paddati ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The original sax-hornbostel method classified instruments into four main groups: sacks ne baad main ek paanchvaan varg joda, electrophone, jaise thermin, jo electronic tareeke se dhwani utpann karte hai
 There are several sub-groups within each class
 is pranali kii aalochana kii gai or ise pichley varshon main sanshodhit kiya gaya, lekin iskaa vyapak rup se prayog organologist or ethnomyuicologist dwaara hi kiya jaataa he
 Andre Schaffner, patron of the Musée de l'homme, disagreed with the saxe-hornbostel system and in 1932 developed his own system
 shafnar kaa maananaa tha ki ek vaadyayantra ke vargeekaran kaa nirdhaaran, uske vaadan kii vidhi ke bajaay uski shaareerik sanrachana ko karnaa chahie
 His method divided the instruments into two classes: instruments whose body is solid and vibratory, and instruments that have staggered air
 pashchimi vaadyayantron ko bhi, usee parivaar ke anya upkarnon ke saath tulana main aksar unki sangeet seemaa dwaara vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 These terminologies are based on the classification of singing sounds: kuch upkaran ek se adhik shrenee main aate hai: udhaaharan ke liye, celo ko yaa to tener yaa baas mana ja saktaa he, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki iskaa sangeet samooh main kaise feet baithta he or trombone ho saktaa he olto, tener, yaa baas or french horn, baas, baritone, tener, yaa olto, is baat par nirbhar karte hue kii kis sa par range yah khelaa jaataa he
 Template: Vocal and instrumental pitch ranges kai vaadyayantron main range, unke naam ke hisse ke rup main hota he: sopraano sexophone, tener sexophone, baritone sexophone, olto bansuri, baas bansuri, olto recorder, baas guitar, aadi
 Additional adjectives describe an instrument above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabas clarinet
 jab kisi vaadya ke naam main istemaal kiye jate hai to ye shabd saapeksh hote hai, jo vaadyayantra ke range ko uske parivaar ke anya upkarnon kii tulana main varnit karte hai or na kii maanav awaz ke range main yaa anya pariwaron ke upkarnon kii tulana main
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek baas bansuri kaa range C3 se F♯6 tak he, jabaki ek baas clerinet ek saptak neeche bajataa he
 Instrumental production is a specialized occupation that requires years of training, practice and sometimes becoming an apprentice
 vaadyayantron ke adhikansh nirmaataa, vaadyayantra kii kisi ek style ke visheshgy hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ek luthiar keval tharawaale vaadya banaata he
 Some producers make only one type of instrument such as a piano
 bhale hi vaadyayantra main dhwani kaise bhi utpann hoti ho, kai vaadyayantron main upyogkarta interfes ke rup main ek kunjeepatal hota he
 Keyboard instruments are instruments that are played by a musical keyboard
 har kunjee ek yaa ek se adhik dhwani utpann karti he; adhikansh kunjeepatal upkarnon main, in dhvaniyon main utar-chadhaav karne ke liye atirikt saadhan hote hai 
 ve hawa ke hilne se yaa pump karne se dhwani utpann kar sakate hai, hilte taron ko thokkar yaa khinchakar, electronic tareekon dwaara, yaa kisi anya tareeke se
 kabhi-kabhi, aise vaadyayantra jinamein aamtaur par ek kunjeepatal nahin hota he, jaise gloucenspil, unamem ek kunjeepatal laga diya jaataa he

 Henry Murray was a US psychologist
 unhone harvard vishvavidhyalay main 30 varsh se bhi adhik samay tak adhyaapan kiya
 Henry Murray was born on 13 May 1893 in New York City
 unhone 1915 main harvard college se snaatak oopaadhi praapt kii
 Initially, he was interested in history, so he studied history deeply
 tatpashchaat mare ne chikitsa shaastra main bhi gahan adhyayan kiya
 He studied subjects related to medicine and biology for twelve years intensively
 isi kaal main unki ruchi manovigyaan main hui
 Yung got his inspiration to study in this field
 yung se prerit hokar mare ne manovigyaan ke kshetra main avchetan manovigyaan kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 He conceptualized the personality of a person by the name of Person Science
 kaalaantar main vyakti vigyaan ko aadhunik manovigyaan kii ek shakha maan liya gaya or vyaktitv vikaas se sambandhit manovaigyanik tathyon kaa gahan adhyayan isi shakha ke antargat kiya jane laga
 The basic premise of Murray's personality theory is that the person is a 'motivated animal'
 mare ne vyaktitv kii avadharana main jaivik nirdharakon par bal diya he
 The neophyteists may have disregarded the biological aspect, but according to Murray, imagining personality is impossible without a brain
 mare ke anusaar- In this definition, personality is considered to be constantly moving
 iske atirikt vyakti ke kuch prakaaryon kaa ullekh bhi paribhaasha main kiya gaya he
 Murray considered the following functions of personality: henry mare ne vyaktitv ke in prakaaryon ke liye kuch vishisht sankalpanaatmak shabdon kaa prayog kiya or inaki vyakhya bhi kii
 which is like this- mare kaa yah maananaa he ki vyakti kaa vyaktitv aavashyaktaaon se utpann tanaavon se prabhavit hota he
 These requirements are biological, psychological and social
 atah vyakti kaa yah prayaas rahata he ki uske is prakaar se utpann hue tanaav main kami ho
 The person fulfills these needs and desires at the individual social and cultural level
 kyonki is prakaar kii ichchhaaon main kunthaayen or abhipsaaen nihit hoti he
 Since man is a social animal and it is not possible for him to stay away from society and fulfill his needs
 is sambandh main henry mare kaa mat he ki tanaav kaa abhaav utana santoshprad nahin hota jitna ki utpann hue tanaav main kami karne kii prakriya se hota he
 They did not agree with Freud that lack of stress provides satisfaction to the person, but according to him that the satisfaction obtained due to reduction in stress is not in the absence of stress
 atah mare ke anusaar aavashyaktaanusaar tanaav kii utpatti or phir usamen kami vyaktitv ke prakaaryon main samahit he
 According to Murray, those measures are also very important in the structure of personality, which set different needs and goals in order
 in upayon se vyakti apni aavashyaktaaon main kram nirdhaaran karata he
 That is, the more important the requirement, the more important will be placed in the ranking
 vyaktitv kii sanrachana main lakshyon kaa kram nirdhaaran kii yah prakriya mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 Henry Murray believes that by scheduling requirements, a person can do more work in less time
 vyakti apni un aavashyaktaaon kii purti karata he jo atyant aavashyak he or isi prakaar un lakshyon ke prapti kii ore pehle dhyaan detaa he jo desh or kaal kii drushti se adhik mahatvapurn hai
 According to Murray, the more the person has the ability to determine, the greater the person will be free from conflicts and tensions
 mare ke anusaar aavashyaktaaon se sambandhit tanaavon main kami ke atirikt vyaktitv ke liye atmabhivyakti bhi bahut jaruri he
 For example, if a person wishes for soul expression through music, he has to take care of choosing a place, time and song that is not painful for others
 is sambandh main mare ne prakriya-kaary ) shabd kaa prayog kiya
 While clarifying the nature of process work, Murray believes that the mind sometimes gets absorbed in such activities which are of short duration, but the mind gets pleasure through them
 isi sandarbh main mare kaa yah maananaa he ki sharir or man sabandhi jitani kriyaayein hai ve aisi kalpanaaon se sambandhit ho jaati he jo vyakti ko anand pradaan karti hai or ve aatm-abhivyakti kaa ek madhyam ban jaati hai
 In time, some verbs take a definite form
 jaise, naatak, nrity, sangeet aadi sambandhi kriyaayein vyakti kii atmabhivyakti main sahaayak hoti he
 According to Murray, a person makes some plans with the help of mental power in the sequence and he sees how it can be fulfilled and what will be the result of his results
 vyakti apni yojanaon yaa lakshyon kaa nirmaan karata he, phir unki purti yaa unako murtt rup dene ke liye unka kram-suchan karata he
 Prioritizing the goal which has to be achieved first will be placed first
 is tarah vyakti lakshyon kii variyata evam unki aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar unka kram-suchan karata he
 In this concept, Murray believes that homogeneity is not found among individuals in terms of ability, ability, academic achievement and aspiration
 jaise, aakanksha kaa str to bahut ooncha he parantu yogyata main kami hoti he
 Sometimes aspiration levels are below, sometimes character flaws occur
 atah vyakti main aakanksha kii purti us samay hi ho paati he jab vyakti uskaa nirdhaaran apni kshamta, yogyata tathaa bauddhik aavashyaktaa ko dhyaan main rakhkar karata he
 a person should determine his aspiration level after taking into consideration his mental, emotional, social, moral and physical abilities
 is sankalpana ke anusaar vyaktitv ke vikaas main samaaj, anuvaanshikta tathaa paryaavaran ko mahatvapurn mana he
 In his view, both the person's past and his history are important in his personality
 vyakti se samaaj kya apeksha rakhata he or vyakti samaaj se kya apeksha rakhata he, iskaa gyaan, phir uske anusaar kaary karnaa saral nahin hota
 The social side of a person's personality prevails
 saamaajik apekshaaon ke anusaar jo log kaary karte hai, unhen samaaj kii pryansa praapt hoti he
 But sometimes situations also arise that a person is unable to work according to the beliefs of his society
 uske kai kaaran ho sakate hai or samaaj kaa roodhibaddh ho janaa bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 Generally, social and cultural determinations in the personality of a person indicate that which behavior should be done by the person and which are not, which actions are ethical and which actions are considered immoral in society
 vyakti ko saamaajik apekshaaon kaa anusaran karte hue saamaajik, saanskrithik mulyon ke anusaar chalanaa hota he or aisa karne se use santosh miltaa he
 Henry Murray gave importance to individual needs in personality development
 unke anusaar vyakti kii jaivik or manovaigyanik aavashyaktaaen anek prakaar kii hoti hai, apni pustak exploration in persenlity main mare ne jaivik or manovaigyanik aavashyaktaaon kii ek suchi bhi di he
 This list of requirements is very comprehensive
 phir bhi uskaa sankshipt vivaran diya ja rahaa he
 In addition to the list of requirements above which Henry Murray has given, he has also made interpretations on the types of requirements
 henry mare ne aavashyaktaaon ke kuch prakaar bataae hai ve is prakaar hai- These requirements are basically body related
 bhukh, pashaas, shwaas, malmutra tyaag aadi aantarik aavashyaktaaen maani gai hai
 According to Henry Murray these requirements are primary
 ye dwitiyak aavashyaktaaen hai
 These requirements arise from internal requirements and take a form of pleasure
 jaise=vastuon ke ekatrikaran kii ichha, samaaj main maanshta tathaa prabhutv prapti kii ichha aadi
 According to Henry Murray, there are certain requirements that are manifested by physical actions or movements, these requirements are manifest
 in aavashyaktaaon kii koti main divaswapn athwa kalpana jaisi maansik kriyaayein hoti hai
 According to Henry Murray, these needs are related to the person's ultimate
 jab vyakti aadarshon, mulyon aadi ko jivan kaa ang banaata he to aprakat aavashyaktaaen sakriy hoti hai kyonki isamen vyakti apni sabhi aavashyaktaaon ko prakat nahin kar paata he
 Some requirements are limited, these are central requirements
 kuch aavashyaktaaen sabhi vastuon se sambandhit hai
 When these needs are more related to the person or thing, then later on they take the form of psychosis
 yadi aavashyaktaaen vikeern rahati hai yaa vyakti yaa vastu se sambandh nahin rakhti hai to isse bhi manovikar utpann hota he
 According to Henry Murray, the requirements which are from a person's inner instincts or which are in a natural form without any stimulation are the foremost requirements
 saamaajik sandarbh main in aavashyaktaaon kaa mahatv mana gaya he
 When a person moves forward from their partner to talk or motivate them to respond, they are requirements
 henry mare ke anusaar ek vyakti jab apane saathi ko anukriya ke liye prerit karata he tab saathi kii anukriya hi pratikriyaatmak aavashyaktaaen hai
 Some actions occur indefinitely without any laksha, such as when a person engages in lax mental activity and wandering in the imaginary world, according to Henry Murray, these actions are the product of process action
 jab vyakti srujanil karsh main lagata he tab nishchaymatrik aavashyaktaa kii purti hoti he
 In this, there is the opposite action of moving in the imaginary world
 vyakti aise karsh karata he jinase kisi kshetra main uski shreshthata siddh ho
 Henry Murray set out different types of requirements, yet he believes that all requirements are related to each other
 kuch aavashyaktaaen teevr hoti hai tathaa unki tushti turant karnaa aavashyak hota he
 On the basis of the intensity and importance of the needs, the person determines their order and tries to solve it
 kuch aavashyaktaaon kii tushti anek prayaas karne par hoti he
 Some requirements are related to the environment
 kuch aavashyaktaaen aantarik tathaa bahsh jivan se prerit hoti hai
 There is a relationship between the person and his environment to influence the fulfillment of needs
 iske liye henry mare ne dabaav yaa press kii sankalpana prastut kii
 Just as needs are influenced by behavior, so too are behaviors affected by environmental influences
 vyakti ko apni aavashyaktaa ke anusaar karsh evam vyavhaar karne ke liye saamaajik niyamon kaa dhashaan rakhana aavashyak ho jaataa he
 These social rules are a form of coercion that does not give full relaxation to the behavior of the individual
 samaaj main vyakti ko dusron kaa dhashaan bhi rakhana padataa he
 Thus their wants and needs have to be fulfilled in the social context itself
 henry mare ne vibhinn prakaar kii aavashyaktaaon kii tarah hi dabaav suchi bhi banaai
 These pressures are divided into two classes - henry mare dwaara prastut dabaabon kii suchi main parivaar, swasthya, samaaj ke sambandhon par aadhaarit hai
 The details of these pressures are as follows: henry mare ne vyakti ke mulyon par bhi prakaash daalaa he
 They have set seven types of prices
 ye mulya hai- Henry Murray's view of personality development is that the history of a person's personality from birth to death is actually a personality
 unhone vyaktitv vikaas par teen baton kaa mukhya rup se ullekh kiya- Henry Murray has considered the special influence of psychologists in personality development
 in manogranthiyon ko shaishavik manovritiyon ke rup main mana he
 These five types are is granthi ke bare main mare kii yah dharna he ki maa ke garbh main rahete hue baccha adhik surakshit anubhav karata he
 When he is born, as soon as he comes out of the womb, he is afraid of the outside environment and suddenly a feeling of insecurity arises in him
 falswaroop navjaat shishu punah garbh main janaa chahta he or yaheen par sanvrutt manogranthi kaa vikaas hota he
 According to Henry Murray, at the core of the closed psychosis lies the desire to move to the first position in the womb and secondly, there is anxiety related to insecurity and helplessness
 teesri baat yah he ki navjaat shishu sanvritti manogranthi ke dwaara ghutan se mukt hona chahta he
 Henry Murray has considered the situation before birth to be a 'simple closed psychosis'
 iskaa ullekh karte hue mare ne bataaya ki navjaat shishu kii yah ichha hoti he ki vah punah garbh jaise sthaan main jaakar apane ko surakshit kar le
 Because within the womb all its requirements are fulfilled on its own and it does not depend on the unwanted thing
 mare ke anusaar sanvrutt manogranthi kaa doosraa rup bhay par aadhaarit he
 When a newborn is born, it wants an open space or is plagued by the fear of falling and it develops into a psychophysical fear
 mare ne sanvrutt manogranthi kaa teesraa rup 'mukti' mana he
 In this, the child wants to be independent, wants to get out and live in an open space
 mare ne is granthi kaa naam nirgaman manogranthi rakhaa
 Like Freud, Henry Murray placed the pleasure he finds in the eating and drinking of the infant under the mouth of the occult, although Henry Murray did not emphasize his work on the side of lust as much as Freud
 henry mare ne mukh manogranthiyon ke teen prakaar maane hai- As a result of oral avidity, the child is engaged in oral activities like eating and drinking and sucking
 jab vah maa kaa stanpan karata he athwa angootha chusata he to use avlambita manogranthi kii santushti milti rahati he
 In aggression psychosis, a child bites an object and feels pleasure
 maa kaa stan kaatna yaa anash kisi ko kaatna aakraamakata manogranthi kii santushti he
 This action later gives rise to aggression
 bade hone par bhi munh se kisi cheez kaa kaatna athwa haklaana is baat kaa sanket detii he ki vyakti main mukh aakraamakata manogranthi prabal he
 Mouth Disclaimer In the occult, the child spits to express their disagreements and unhappiness and expresses their unhappiness or ill-feelings towards the oral actions and friends
 jaise bachche kaa doodh pine se inkaar karnaa yaa koi vishesh prakaar ke bhojan ko na karnaa
 According to Henry Murray, when a child has frequent bowel movements, he feels a kind of pleasure
 isko mare ne guda asveekaran manogranthi kaha he
 When the child stops bowel movement and does not have a quick bowel movement, this tendency is considered as anal obstruction
 is manogranthi main balak yaa vyakti ko mutr tyaag karte samay ek vashidd prakaar ke sukh kii anubhuti hoti he
 Some children urinate on the bed itself
 aisa karne se use sukh miltaa he
 It is also a form of urethral occlusion
 henry mare ne frydwadiyon kii tarah badhiyaakaran manogranthi ko mahatvapurn sthaan nahin diya
 He says that the interpretation of castration should be confined to its literal meaning
 unke kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki bachche kii kalpana main yah baat aati he ki uskaa ling kaat diya ja saktaa he to uske falswaroop uske man main ek chintaa utpann hoti he
 But this anxiety can be considered as the cause of all types of mental tapi psychosis
 vyaktitv ke vikaas par henry mare ne is baat ko spasht kiya ki is par jaivik nirdhaaran ke saath-saath saanskrithik nirdharakon kaa bhi prabhaav padataa he
 According to Dr
 Jaiswal, Henry Murray made it clear that every person - jab vyakti main vibhinn jaivik or saanskrithik nirdharakon main samanthaayen pai jaati he to vah sabhi vyaktiyon ke samaan hota he
 Many societies and cultures have elements that are common in all cultures
 isi prakaar jivan vigyaan kii drushti se manushya main manoshaririya rachana main anek tatv samaan paae jate hai
 Murray, in his second point, believed that each person is similar to some individuals, in which he mentions those qualities found in a person that are related to a culture
 ek samskruti main rahane vaale vyaktiyon ke vyaktitv main kuch samaan gun paae jate hai
 For example, in the personality of an Indian, some common qualities of Indianness will be found which are the result of Indian culture
 isi tarah duusare deshavaasiyon jaise germany ke logon main kuch aise ubhaynishth lakshan paae jaaenge jo german samskruti kii dein he
 In his third point, Murray says that one person is not the same as another person
 iskaa taatpary vyaktitv kii ananyta se he
 Uniqueness of personality is due to both biological and cultural reasons, due to gender and age, body texture, color etc
 iske atirikt shaareerik shakti kii seemaa adhigam kii kshamta, niraashaa or kunthaon ko bardaasht karne kii seemaa prayek vyakti main bhinn-bhinn hoti he
 These reasons are also helpful in determining the person's exclusivity
 henry mare ke anusaar manushya kii samajikaran kii prakriya apane parivaar main shishav kaal se hi prarambh ho jaati he
 Family members begin to teach the newborn baby
 atah samajikaran main parivaar or uske sadasyon kii ek ahm bhoomika hoti he

 When a child grows up, he moves out of the family and goes to the neighborhood and school, there is also socialization there
