 Hillary devoted her entire life to the service of Nepali Sherpas living near the Kumbu Glacier

 The language of these people is Sherpa language and these people believe in Buddhism
 britain ke parvatarohan ke ek visheshgy ne daawa kiya he ki mount everest kii chotii par sabase pehle 'sar' edmund hillari nahin pahunche the
 Rather, it was three decades before a British mountaineer, George Malouri, achieved this feat
 graham hoyaland ne bachapan main suni kahani par teen dashak tak shodh kiya
 According to the story, Malouri first took part in three mountaineering expeditions to Everest
 mana jaataa tha ki vah shikhar tak pahunchne se chook gaye the
 Whereas the reality is that he managed to reach Everest and died while returning from the peak

 bakhaari yaa annagaar main ann ko bhandaarit kiya jaataa he
 In ancient times, grains were stored in pottery
 kuch kisaan kachi mitti ko bhuse se prabalit karke annagaar banaate the jisko 'dehri' kaha jaataa tha
 Nowadays metal dehri has started being found
 ise 'ann kii kothi' bhi kehete hai
 The barns are often made slightly above the ground so that the grain can be saved from rats and moisture
 band jalsambar yaa samaavruth jalsambar bhugol main aise jalsambar kshetra ko kaha jaataa he jisamen varsha athwa pighalati barf kaa pani ekatrit ho kar kisi nadi ke zariye samudr yaa mahaasaagar main bahane kii bajaay kisi sarovar, daldali kshetra yaa shushk kshetra main jaakar vahin ruk jaataa he
 Normally, whatever water falls on the earth due to rain or snow, it flows from the highlands to the lowlands through rivers, Nehru and waterfalls
 yah chalate pani ke samooh ek-dusre se sangam karte rahete hai jab tak ke ek hi badi nadi na ban jaae
 Then this river later joins some ocean
 lekin jo kshetra sagaron se dhalaan, pahaado yaa registaanon kii vajah se pruthak hai vahaan par pani sab se nichle sthaan par pahunch kar ruk jaataa he
 At such places, either lakes are formed or the earth absorbs the water
 duniya kii sab se badi jhiilon main aise hi band jalsambharon kii vajah se bani hui kuch jhilein hai, jaise kii aral sagar or caspian sagar
 The closed watershed in English is called the "endorheic Basin"
 bhugolic drushti se aisa dekha jaataa he ke band jalsambar vaale kshetra praayah registani kshetra bhi hote hai
 This is because if the water keeps increasing at one place, then eventually the water defeats the barrier between itself and the sea
 vaigyanikon kaa anumaan he ke krishna sagar kisi samay par aisi hi ek band jalsambar kii jhil thi jo pani badhane se apni simaaon ko todakar bumadhya sagar se ja mili
 The salt and other substances which are found in the open watersheds later flow into the ocean
 band jalsambharon main aisa nahin hota
 Salt and other substances found in water accumulate in these lakes or dry areas
 isliye band jalsambar jhilein samay ke saath bahut khaari ho jaati hai
 Sambhar Lake, located near Ajmer in the Indian state of Rajasthan, is a saline lake of similar closed watershed
 aisi jhiilon par pradushan kaa bhi bahut bura asar padataa he kyonki pradooshak samudr main bah kar teetar-bitar hone kii bajaay ekatrit hokar badhate hi rahete hai
 The number of closed watersheds in different continents also differs due to their different geographical and seasonal conditions
 australia kaa lagbhag 21% kshetrafal band jalsanbharon kaa kshetra he jabaki uttar america main band jalsambar keval 5% kshetra par faile hai
 About 18% of the world's land area suffers from closed watersheds
 duniya ke sab se adhik kshetrafal vaale band jalsambar asia ke bhitari ilaakon main paae jate hai
 In some dry areas, closed watersheds bring salt and other salts, but evaporate rapidly due to heat and dryness
 kahin-kahin par pani keval ek hi mausam main bah kar aata he yaa kuch yogon tak bahane ke baad bhugolic paristithiyon ke badal jane se aana band ho jaataa he
 The thick and hard layer of salt in such dry lake areas forms a wide flat plain that stretches for miles and miles
 kyonki aise namak ke maidan bilkul samtal or bahut bade hote hai, inkaa prayog tej gadiyon dwaara gati kirtiman sthapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the size of closed water reservoir lakes varies with the changing water flow with the seasons
 yah jhilein sookhe mausam main sikud jaati hai or barishon yaa himpat kii vajah se bad jaati hai
 Sometimes when the water is low, a lake gets divided into many small lakes and then after the rains the water rises and then it becomes a big lake
 agar kisi kshetra main aarthik vikaas ke saath pani rokane vaale band yaa sinchai ke liye naharen bana di jaaen jo band jalsambar jhiilon main pani kaa bahaav kam kar den, to aksar yah jhilein sikud kar bahut choti ho jaati hai
 In such a situation, those populations which depend on these lakes for their business or life have a very bad effect
 aisa hi kuch madhya asia ke aral sagar ke saath hua he
 The present day Casa Fort was earlier known as the Padmadurg Fort
 yah kila maharashtra ke raigarh jila mein sthit he

 This fort can be entered only with the permission of Mumbai Port Trust
 teisavin putali jiskaa naam dharmavati tha, ne is prakaar katha kahi- ek baar raja vikramaditya darbar main baithe the or darbariyon se baatcheet kar rahe the
 In the course of the conversation, a debate broke out among the courtiers on whether a man is greater than his birth or through karma
 bahes kaa ant nahin ho rahaa tha, kyonki darbariyon ke do gut ho chuke the
 One used to say that man is greater than birth because man's birth is the result of his past births
 achche sanskaar manushya main vanshanugat hote hai jaise raja kaa betaa raja ho jaataa he
 His attitude too is like Kings
 kuch darbariyon kaa mat tha ki karm hi pradhan he
 a person born in a good family also gets addicted to mishaps and goes towards degradation by indulging in deeds against dignity
 apane dushkarmon or duraachaar ke chalate koi saamaajik pratishtha praapt nahin karte or sarvatra tiraskaar pate hai
 At this point, the first group argued that the original rituals cannot be destroyed like the lotus plant does not lose its virtue even while living in mud
 gulab kaanton par paidaa hokar bhi apni sugandh nahin khota or chandan ke vriksh par sarpon kaa vaas hone se bhi chandan apni sugangh or sheetaltaa barkaraar rakhata he, kabhi bhi vishaiylla nahin hota
 Both sides tried to justify themselves by their arguments
 koi bhi apana vichaar badalane ko raji nahin tha
 Vikram was quietly enjoying their arguments
 jab unki bahes bahut aage bad gai to raja ne unhen shant rahane kaa aadesh diya or kaha ki ve pratyaksh udhaaharan dwaara karenge
 He ordered that a lion's child be brought from the forest
 turant kuch shikari jangal gaye or ek singh kaa navjaat shaavak uthaakar le aae
 He called a shepherd and asked him to raise the newborn cub along with the goat's children
 gaderiye kii samaj main kuch nahin aayaa, lekin raja kaa aadesh maanakar vah shaashak ko le gaya
 The cub was brought up with the children of the goat
 vah bhi bhukh mitaane ke liye bakriyon kaa doodh pine laga jab bakrii ke bachche bad hue to ghaas or pattiyaan charne lage
 The cub too ate leaves fondly
 kuch or bada hone par doodh to vah peetaa rahaa, magar ghaas or pattiyaan chaahakar bhi nahin kha paata
 One day when Vikram called him to tell him about the condition of the cub, he told them that the lion's child behaves exactly like goats
 usne raja se vinati kii ki use shaavak ko maance khilaane kii anumati di jaae, kyonki shaavak ko ab ghaas or pattiyaan acchhee nahin lagati hai
 Vikram flatly refused and said that he should be nurtured only on milk
 gaderia uljhan main pad gaya
 He did not understand why Maharaj is bent on making a carnivorous animal vegetarian
 vah ghar laut aayaa
 The cub, who was now young, lived with goats all day and drank milk
 kabhi-kabhi bahut adhik bhukh lagane par ghaas-pattiyaan bhi kha letaa
 Like other goats, when he was pulled towards the court in the evening, he would rise silently with his head bowed and would not resist when closed
 ek din jab vah anya bakriyon ke saath char rahaa tha to pinjre main band ek singh ko laayaa gaya
 On seeing Singh, all the goats started running away with fear, he also ran away with the tail
 uske baad raja ne gaderiein ko use swatantra rup se rakhane ko kaha
 When hungry, he hunted the rabbit and ate his appetite
 kuch din swatantra rup se rahane par vah chote-chote jaanwaron ko markar khaane laga
 But at the behest of the shepherd, the cage would shut down peacefully
 kuch dinon baad uskaa bakriyon kii tarah bheeru swabhaav jaataa rahaa
 One day when the same lion was brought before him again, he did not run away in fear
 sher kii dahaad usne suni to vah bhi puure swar se dahaada
 The king was watching everything with his courtiers
 unhone darbariyon ko kaha ki insaan main mul pravritiyaan sher ke bachche kii tarah hi janm se hoti hai
 Those trends are automatically exposed on occasion as happened with this cub
 bakriyon ke saath rahete hue uski singh vaali pravriti chhip gai thi, magar swatantra rup se vicharan karne par apane-aap prakat ho gai
 Nobody has taught all this to him
 lekin manushya kaa sammaan karm ke anusaar kiya janaa chahie
 All agreed, but one minister did not agree with the king's words
 uskaa maananaa tha ki vikram rajkul main paidaa hone ke kaaran hi raja hue anyathaa saat janmon tak karm karne ke baad bhi raja nahin hote
 The king just smiled
 samay bitta rahaa
 One day a sailor appeared in his court with a beautiful flower
 phool sachmuch vilakshan tha or logon ne pehali baar itnaa sundar laal phool dekha tha
 The king sent to trace the origin of the flower
 ve donon us disha main naav se badhate gaye jidhar se phool bahakar aayaa tha
 The stream of the river used to be very narrow and intense, somewhere flowing over the rocks
 kaaphi durgam rasta tha
 The flowing boat reached the place where there was a wonderful view on the shore
 ek bade ped par janziron kii ragad se uske sharir par kai gahare ghaav ban gaye the
 Blood was being sucked from the wounds which when falling into the river turned into bloody flowers
 kuch duuri par hi kuch sadhu baithe tapasya main leen the
 When he returned to the court with some more flowers, the minister told the king everything
 tab vikram ne use samajhaayaa ki us ulate latake yogi ko raja samajho or anya sadhnarat sanyasi uske darbari hue
 This deed of previous birth makes him king or courtier
 ab mantri ko raja kii baat samaj main aa gai
 He assumed that one gets a throne only as a result of the deeds of previous birth

 After the British Raj settled in India, for the first time, the idea of placing non-government people in legislative bodies was accepted
 1860 or 1870 ke dashakon se hi bharatiyon main raajnneetik chetana panpane lagi thi
 The Indian public had become politically aware in the late 1870s to the early 1880s
 1885 main is raajnneetik chetana ne karavat badali
 Intellectuals active in Indian political and politics felt the need of an organization to fight at national level for national interests

 bhartiya swatantraaa adhinium, 1947 main bharat kii samvidhan sabhako purna prabhusatta sampann nikaay ghoshit kiya gaya
 On the midnight of 14-15 August 1947, that assembly assumed full powers to govern the country
 adhinium kii dhara 8 ke dwaara samvidhan sabha ko purna vidhaayi shakti praapt ho gai
 But at the same time it was felt that it would be necessary to maintain a distinction between the Constitution-making work of the Constituent Assembly and its ordinary work as a Legislature
 samvidhan sabha kii ek alag nikaay ke rup main pehali baithak 17 navambar 1947 ko hui
 Its President was Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, the head of the assembly
 samvidhan adhyaksh pad ke liye keval shri ji

 Hence he was declared duly elected
 14 navambar 1948 ko samvidhan kaa praaroop samvidhan sabha main praaroop samiti ke sabhapati biaar ambedkar ne pesh kiya
 There was a majority in favor of the proposal
 26 janvari 1950 ko swatantra bharat ke ganraajya kaa samvidhan lagu ho gaya
 This led to the establishment of a complete parliamentary system, including the modern institutional structure and all its other branch-branches
 samvidhan sabha bharat kii asthaayee sansad ban gai
 After the first general elections on the basis of adult suffrage, the Parliament continued to function in the same manner until the constitution of the new constitution

 Parliament is the supreme representative body of the people in Indian democracy
 isi madhyam se aam logon kii samprabhutaa ko abhivyakti milti he
 Parliament is the proof that the public is at the top of our political system, public opinion is paramount
 ‘sansadeey’ shabd kaa arth hi aisi loktantratmak raajnneetik vyavastha he jahaan sarvocch shakti logon ke pratinidhiyon ke us nikaay main nihit he jise ‘sansad’ kehete hai
 Under the Constitution of India, the Federal Legislature is called 'parliament'
 yah vah dhuree he, jo desh ke shashan kii neenv he
 The Indian Parliament is made up of the President and two Houses — the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha
 vaise to bharat kaa raashtrapati sansad kaa ang hota he, phir bhi vah donon main se kisi bhi sadan main na to baithta he, na hi uski charchaaon main bhaag letaa he
 The President invites both the Houses of Parliament from time to time for a meeting
 donon sadanon dwaara paas kiya gaya koi vidheyak tabhi kanoon ban saktaa he jab raashtrapati us par apni anumati pradaan kar de
 Not only this, when both the Houses of Parliament are not in session and the President feels that immediate action is necessary in these circumstances, then he can issue an ordinance
 is adhyadesh kii shakti evam prabhaav vahi hota he jo sansad dwaara paas kii gai vidhi kaa hota he
 At the beginning of the session after every general election to the Lok Sabha and at the beginning of the first session of every year, the President addresses both the Houses of Parliament simultaneously
 vah sadanon kii baithak bulaane ke kaarnon kii sansad ko soochna detaa he
 Apart from this, he can address either one House of Parliament or both simultaneously
 iske liye vah sadasyon kii upasthiti kii apeksha kar saktaa he
 He has the right to send a message or any other message in respect of any bill pending in Parliament to any House
 jis sadan ko koi sandesh is prakaar bheja gaya ho vah sadan us sandesh main likhe vishay par suvidhanusaar shighrata se vichaar karata he
 Certain types of Bills can be introduced only after receiving the recommendation of the President or any further action can be taken on them
 jaisaa ki iske naam se pataa chalata he, rajyasabha rajyon kii parishad he
 It represents the people indirectly
 rajyasabha ke sadsy kaa chunaav rajya vidhaan sabhaaon ke chune hue vidhayak karte hai
 The number of representatives of each state depends mostly on its population
 is prakaar,chhattisgarh ke rajyasabha main 5 sadsy hai, uttar pradesh ke rajyasabha main 31 sadsy hai
 Manipur, Mizoram, Sikkim, Tripura etc
 are only one member of smaller states
 rajyasabha main 250 tak sadsy ho sakate hai
 It consists of 12 members nominated by the President and elected by 238 States and Union Territories
 is samay rajyasabha ke 245 sadsy hai
 Each member of the Rajya Sabha has a term of six years
 uparashtrapati, sansad ke donon sadanon ke sadasyon dwaara nirvaachit kiya jaataa he
 He is the ex-officio Chairman of Rajya Sabha

 is prakaar sadan kii adhiktam sadsy sankhya 552 ho, aisi samvidhan main pariklpana kii gai he
 The Lok Sabha has reserved seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes on the basis of population-ratio
 aarambh main yah aarakshan das varsh ke liye tha
 Under the latest amendment, it is now for fifty years i
e
 2000 years
 bharat main sadan kii karyavadhi paanch varshon kii he
 The House itself is dissolved when the five-year period ends
 kuch paristhatiyon main sansad ko purna karyavadhi samaapt hone se pehle hi bhang kiya ja saktaa he
 Parliament can extend the term of the Lok Sabha in case of emergency
 yah ek baar main ek varsh se adhik nahin ho sakati
 The two Houses of Parliament enjoy equal powers and status in all areas except in certain cases
 koi bhi gaiyr-vittiya vidheyak adhinium banane se pehle donon main se prayek sadan dwaara paas kiya janaa aavashyak he
 The Rajya Sabha has the same powers as the Lok Sabha in important matters such as impeachment of the President, removal of the vice-president, amending the Constitution and removal of judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts
 raashtrapati ke adhyadeshon, apaat kii udghoshnaa or kisi rajya main sanvaidhanik vyavastha ke vifal ho jane kii udghoshnaa or kisi rajya main sanvaidhanik vyavastha ke vifal ho jane kii udghoshnaa ko sansad ke donon sadanon ke samaksh rakhana anivaary he
 Disagreements between the two Houses on any other Bill except a Money Bill and a Constitution Amendment Bill are resolved by both Houses in a joint sitting
 is baithak main maamle bahumat dwaara tay kiye jate hai
 The Presiding Officer of such a meeting of both the Houses is the Speaker of the Lok Sabha
 bharat main pradhanmantri or mantri donon sadanon main se kisi bhi ek kaa sadsy ho sakate hai
 a person can also be appointed Prime Minister or Minister who is not a member of either House of Parliament, but has to leave the post after six months, if in the meantime, he is not elected to either House
 Go mantriparishad samuhik rup se lok sabha ke prati uttaradaayi he
 Finally, it is necessary for him to resign as soon as he loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha
 sansadeey shashan kaa arth hona chahie sansad dwaara shashan
 But the Parliament does not govern itself nor can it
 mantriparishad ke bare main ek tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki yah sansad kii mahaan karypalika samiti hoti he
 Who is entrusted with the responsibility of governing on behalf of the parent body
 sansad kaa kaary vidhaan bananaa, mantranaa dena, aalochana karnaa or logon kii shikayaton ko vyakt karnaa he
 The executive's job is to govern, although she governs on behalf of the Parliament
 bharat jaise bade or baari jansankhya vaale desh main chunaav karana ek bahut bada kaam he
 An independent Election Commission has been set up to ensure that elections to both houses of Parliament - Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha - are unhindered and fair
 lok sabha ke liye saamaanya chunaav jab uski kaaryvadhi samaapt hone vaali ho yaa uske bhang kiye jane par karaae jate hai
 Every citizen of India who is 18 years of age or above is entitled to vote
 loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladane ke liye kam se kam aayu 25 varsh he or rajyasabha ke liye 30 varsh
 Rajya Sabha members represent the people of the states
 inkaa chunaav rajya kii vidhaan sabha ke chune hue sadasyon dwaara hota he
 The President issues a notification on the date suggested by the Election Commission to fill a seat in the Rajya Sabha
 jis tithi ko sevanivrutt hone vaale sadasyon kii padaavadhi samaapt honi ho usase teen maas se adhik samay se purv aisi adhisuchana jari nahin kii jaati
 The Election Officer, with the approval of the Election Commission, determines and notifies the place of voting
 nayi lok sabha ke chunaav ke liye raashtrapati, rajptr main prakashit adhisuchana dwaara, chunaav ayog dwaara sujhai gai tithi ko, sabhi sansadeey nirvachan kshetron se sadsy chunane ke liye kahata he
 After the notification is issued, the Election Commission sets dates for filing nomination papers, scrutinizing them, withdrawing them and voting
 lok sabha ke liye pratyaksh chunaav hone ke kaaran bharat ke rajya kshetra ko upyukt pradeshik nirvachan kshetron main baanta jaataa he
 One member is elected from each parliamentary constituency
 yadi ek sadan kaa koi sadsy duusare sadan ke liye bhi chun liya jaataa he to pehle sadan main uskaa sthaan us tithi se khaali ho jaataa he jab vah anya sadan ke liye chunaa gaya ho
 Similarly, if he is also elected as a member of a State Legislature, if he does not resign from his place in the State Legislature, within 14 days from the publication of the proclamation in the State Gazette, the Parliament The member is no more
 yadi koi sadsy, sadan kii anumati ke bina 60 din kii avadhi tak sadan kii kisi baithak main upasthit nahin hota to vah sadan uske sthaan ko rikt ghoshit kar saktaa he
 Further, a member has to vacate his place in the House if yadi kisi sadsy ko samvidhan kii dasvin anusuchee ke upbandho ke antargat dal-badal ke aadhaar par ayogy siddh kar diya gaya ho, to us sthiti main bhi uski sadsyta samaapt ho sakati he
 An election to a House of Parliament or a State Legislature can be challenged in the High Court
 yachika chunaav ke dauraan koi bhrasht prakriya apnaane ke kaaran pesh kii ja sakati he
 If proved, the High Court has the power to declare the election of successful candidate void
 prabhavit paksh ko ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke viruddh ucchtam nyaayalay main apil karne kaa adhikaar he
 The Lok Sabha is constituted after every general election by notification of Election Commission
 lok sabha kii pehali baithak shapath vidhi ke saath shuru hoti he
 Its newly elected members take an oath 'to have reverence and allegiance to the Constitution of India', 'to keep the sovereignty and integrity of India intact' and 'to devoutly discharge the duties of a Member of Parliament'
 raashtrapati samay samay par sansad ke prayek sadan ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karata he
 After the last date of each session, the President has to invite the Houses for the meeting for the forthcoming session within six months
 yadhyapi sadanon ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karne kii shakti raashtrapati main nihit he tathaapi vyavhaar main is aashay ke prastaav kii pahal sarkaar dwaara kii jaati he
 There are usually three sessions or sessions of Parliament every year
 yatha bajet adhiveshan, monsoon adhiveshan or sheetakaaleen adhiveshan 
 But, in the case of Rajya Sabha, the budget session is divided into two sessions
 in do adhiveshnon ke bich teen se chaar saptaah kaa avkaash hota he
 Thus, there are four sessions in a year of Rajya Sabha
 raashtrapati kaa abhibhaashan The president is elected following the oath of newly elected members
 iske baad, raashtrapati sansad bhawan ke kendriya kaksh main ek saath sansad ke donon sadanon ke samaksh abhibhaashan karata he
 The President's address is a very important occasion
 abhibhaashan main aisi nitiyon evam kaaryakramon kaa vivaran hota he jinhen aagaamee varsh main kaaryrup dene kaa vichaar ho
 Also, a review of his activities and successes of the first year is also given
 vah abhibhaashan chunki sarkaar kii niti kaa vivaran hota he ant: sarkaar dwaara taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Addressing is discussed very widely
 dhanyavad prastaav ke sanshodhano ke dwaara un maamalon par bhi charchaa ho sakati he jinka abhibhaashan main vishesh rup se ullekh na ho
 The Lok Sabha elects two members of the House as Speaker and Deputy Speaker
 kuch aisi parampara bani he ki upaadhyaksh vipaksh ke sadasyon main se chunaa jaataa he
 It is often the effort of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman in the Rajya Sabha to conduct the proceedings of their House in an orderly manner
 sansadeey kaary do mukhya shirshon main baanta ja saktaa he
 Government work and non-government work
 sarkari kaary ko phir do shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he, The work of non-official members, that is, Bills and Resolutions, is discussed on every Friday or any day which the Speaker determines for two and a half hours
 sadan main kiye jane vaale vibhinn kaaryon ke liye samay kii sifarish saamanytah kaary mantranaa samiti dwaara kii jaati he
 There is usually a meeting every week
 sansad ke donon sadanon kii kaarywahi kii chhapi hui pratiyaan saamanytah baithak ke baad ek maas ke andar uplabdh kara di jaati hai
 The proceedings are tape-recorded
 vaad vivaad ke adhivationavaar chape hue khand hindi tathaa angreji bhashaa main uplabdh hote hai
 The government is responsible to the Parliament for every mistake it makes and to the people through Parliament
 sadan ke sadsy is adhikaar kaa prayog, anya baton ke saath saath, sansadeey prashnon ke madhyam se karte hai
 Members of Parliament have the right to ask for information from the Ministers of the Government on matters of public importance
 jaankaree praapt karnaa prayek gaiyr-sarkari sadsy kaa sansadeey adhikaar he
 It is necessary for a Member of Parliament as a representative of the people that he is aware of the activities of the Government to carry out his responsibilities
 prashn poochne kaa mul uddeshy lok mahatv ke kisi maamle par jaankaree praapt karnaa or tathy jaananaa he
 In both the Houses, questions are held for an hour at the beginning of each meeting
 or unke uttar die jate hai
 This is called the 'question Hour'
 iske atirikt, khoji or anupoorak prashn poochne se mantriyon kaa bhi pareekshan hota he ki ve apane vibhaagon ke kaarykaran ko kitna samajhate hai
 The Question Hour is the most interesting part of the proceedings of Parliament
 logon ke liye samachar patron ke liye or swayan sadasyon ke liye koi anya kaary itani dilchaspee paidaa nahin karata jitani ki prashnkaal paidaa karata he
 The atmosphere of the house during this period is uncertain
 kabhi achaanak tanaav kaa bavandar uth khadaa hota he to kabhi kahkahe lagane lagate hai
 Occasionally a question arises from a bitter argument
 aisi haalat sadasyon yaa mantriyon kii hajir-javaabi or vinodpriyata se dur ho jaati he
 This is the reason that during the Question Hour not only the House Room but also the audience and press galleries are almost always full
 kuch prashnon kaa maukhik uttar diya jaataa he
 These are called starred questions
 atarankit prashnon kaa likhit uttar diya jaataa he
 It can be said with certainty that members have been showing great interest in exercising their right to ask questions
 chunki prashnon kii prakriya apekshtah saral or aasaan he
 Therefore, it is becoming more and more beloved among Members of Parliament than other measures of parliamentary procedure
 sansad ke donon sadanon main prashnkaal ke thik baad kaa samay aamtaur par ‘shoonyakaal’ athwa jiro aavar ke naam se janaa jane laga he
 It is zero in more than one sense
 12 baje dopaher kaa samay na to madhyahn purv kaa samay hota he or na hi madhyahn pashchaat kaa samay
 'zero Hour' is also known as 'hour' due to its commencement at 12 o'clock because earlier 'zero Hour' used to run for a full hour, that is, until the house was recessed for dinner at 1 o'clock in the day
 yah koi nahin kah saktaa ki is kaal ke dauraan koun-sa maamla uth khadaa ho yaa sarkaar par kis tarah kaa akraman kar diya jaae
 There is no mention of 'zero time' anywhere in the rules
 prashnkaal ke samaapt hote hi sadsygan aise maamle uthaane ke liye khadey ho jate hai jinke bare main ve mahasoos karte hai ki kaarywahi karne main deree nahin kii ja sakati
 However, there is no provision in the rules for raising the case thus
 aisa prathit hota he ki is pratha ke peeche yahi vichaar rahaa he ki aise niyam jo rashtriya mahatv ke maamle yaa logon kii gambhir shikayaton sambandhi maamle sadan main turant uthaae jane main sadasyon ke liye baadhak hote hai, ve nirarthak hai
 In terms of rules, the so-called 'zero time' is an irregularity
 maamle chunki bina anumati ke yaa bina purv soochna ke uthaae jate hai atah isse sadan kaa bahumoolya samay vyarth jaataa he
 This leads to encroachment of legislative, financial and other routine work of the House
 ab to shoonyakaal main uthaaye jane vaale kuch maamalon kii pehle se di gai soochna ke aadhaar par, adhyaksh kii anumati se, ek suchi bhi banane lagi he
 The rules of both the Houses of Parliament provide for raising matters of public importance without delay and in many ways
 jo vibhinn prakriyaayein prayek sadsy ko uplabdh rahati hai ve is prakaar hai: By this, the matter of immediate importance can be discussed by stopping the regular work of the Lok Sabha
 iske dwaara koi bhi sadsy sarkaar kaa dhyaan tatkaal mahatv ke maamle kii or dilaa saktaa he
 The minister has to give a statement in that case
 dhyanakarshan karne vaale prayek sadsy ko ek prashn poochne kaa adhikaar hota he
 They can discuss questions of immediate importance for one hour
 haalaanki is par matdaan nahin hota
 How our elected representatives try to raise matters which have no relation to the interpretation of rules and regulations
 lekin ye maamle us samay unhen or unke nirvachan kshetra ke logon ko uttejit kar rahe hote hai
 The matters which are not questions of the system or which cannot be raised under the rules related to questions, short notice questions, call attention proposals, etc
, are raised under it
 sadan lok mahatv ke vibhinn maamalon par anek faisle karata he or apni raay vyakt karata he
 Any member can put a suggestion before the House in the form of a resolution
 jisamen uski raay yaa ichha di gai ho
 If the House accepts it then it becomes the opinion or wish of the entire House
 ant: mote taur par ‘prastaav’ sadan kaa faisla jaanane ke liye sadan ke saamne laayaa jaataa he
 The proposals are actually the basis of parliamentary proceedings
 lok mahatv kaa koi bhi maamla kisi prastaav kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 Proposals may be offered by different members for different purposes
 prastaav mantriyon dwaara pesh kiye ja sakate hai or gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon dwaara bhi
 The purpose of the proposals presented by non-government members is usually to know the opinion or views of the government on a matter
 sankalp bhi ek prakriyaagat upaay he yah aam logon ke hit ke kisi maamle par sadan main charchaa uthaane ke liye sadasyon or mantriyon ko uplabdh he
 Resolutions can be in the form of a declaration of opinion, or recommendation, similar to resolutions of the general form
 yaa kisi aise anya rup main ho saktaa he jaisaa ki adhyaksh uchit samajhe
 The Council of Ministers remains in office till it has the confidence of the Lok Sabha
 lok sabha dwaara mantriparishad main avishvaas vyakt karte hi sarkaar ko sanvaidhanik rup se pad chhodana hota he
 The rules provide for a motion to this effect called a motion of no confidence
 rajyasabha ko avishvaas prastaav par vichaar karne kii shakti praapt nahin he
 The motion of censure differs from the motion of no-confidence
 avishvaas ke prastaav main un kaarnon kaa ullekh nahin hota jin par vah aadhaarit ho
 But it is necessary to mention such reasons or allegations in the motion of condemnation
 yah prastaav katipay nitiyon or kaaryon ke liye sarkaar kii ninda karne ke iraade se pesh kiya jaataa he
 The censure motion is moved against the Council of Ministers or against any one minister or against some ministers
 usamen kisi mantri yaa mantriyon kii vifaltaa par sadan dwaara khed, rosh yaa aashcharya prakat kiya jaataa he
 Government has to do many tasks of governance, security and public welfare
 in sabake liye bahut saadhan chahie
 Where should he come from? The government collects taxes from the public
 jarurat padane par karje bhi leti he
 Because we live in a parliamentary system, it is necessary for the government to get the approval of Parliament before imposing any tax or incurring any expenditure
 is manjuuri ko lene ke liye hi har varsh sarkaar ek bajet yani puure saal kii aamadani or kharche kaa lekha jokha sansad main pesh karti he
 Rail budget and general budget are presented separately
 saamaanya bajet praayah farvari ke antim kaary diwas par laayaa jaataa he
 The railway budget comes a few days before that
 vittiya varsh is samay prayek saal kii pehali april se aarambh hota he
 It is proposed in the budget that how much money is to be spent on the item during the coming year
 usamen kitna dhan kis tareeke se aayega yaa kahan se jutaya jayega
 Grants are given for the coming year of the budget
 sarkaar ko apni vittiya or aarthik nitiyon tathaa kaaryakramon or unki vyakhya karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 At the same time, Parliament also gets an opportunity to consider and criticize them
 bajet paas karne kii prakriya main sansad ke donon sadanon main gambhir evam purna charchaa hoti he
 This happens a few days after the budget is presented
 charchaa saamaanya vaad vivaad se aarambh hoti he
 It lasts for three or four days in both houses of Parliament
 pratha yah he ki is avasthaa main sadsy sarkaar kii rajkoshiya or aarthik nitiyon ke saamaanya pahaluon par hi vichaar karte hai
 Do not go into tax and expenditure details
 is prakaar saamaanya vaad vivaad se prayek sadan ko apane vichaar vyakt karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 The government also realizes what will be the reaction to a particular proposal in later stages
 yah dhyaan dene kii baat he ki rajyasabha ko saamaanya charchaa ke alaava bajet se koi sarokaar nahin hota
 Voting on demands takes place only in the Lok Sabha
 duusari avasthaa anudaanon kii maangon par charchaa or matdaan kii he
 Normally, separate demands are placed for the proposed grants for each ministry
 in ‘maango’ kaa sambandh bajet ke vyay vaale bhaag se hota he
 Their form is that of the request made by the Executive to the Lok Sabha to be given the right to spend the amount demanded
 maango par charchaa ruchipurna hoti he
 During the discussions, the policies and activities of the Ministry are closely scrutinized
 anudaanon kii maangon ke mul prastaav ke sahaayak prastaav pesh karke sadsy aisa kar sakate hai
 These subsidiary proposals are called 'cut motions' in parliamentary language
 bajet paas karne kii prakriya bajet pesh kiye jane se is par charchaa karne or anudaanon kii maange sweekrut karne or viniyog tathaa vitt vidheyakon ke paas hone tak saamanytah chaalu vittiya varsh ke aarambh hone ke baad tak chalati rahati he
 Till Parliament approves the demands, it is necessary that the government has sufficient funds available to run the administration of the country
 isliye ‘lekhanudaan’ ke liye vishesh upbandh kiya gaya he
 By which the Lok Sabha has been given the power to grant advance grants for a part of a financial year till the completion of the budget process
 kanoon bananaa sansad kaa pramukh kaam mana jaataa he
 The initiative for this is mostly done by the executive
 sarkaar vidhaayi prastaav pesh karti he
 After discussion and debate on it, Parliament imposes its seal of approval on it
 sabhi kanoonee prastaav vidheyak ke rup main sansad main pesh kiye jate hai
 a bill is a draft legislative proposal
 vidheyak sansad ke kisi ek sadan main sarkaar dwaara yaa kisi gaiyr-sarkari sadsy dwaara pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus broadly, there are two types of Bills: Government Bills and Private Members' Bills
 vidhi kaa rup lene vaale adhikansh vidheyak sarkari vidheyak hote hai
 By the way, very few bills of non-government members take the form of law
 phir bhi unke dwaara yah baat sarkaar or logon ke dhyaan main laai jaati he ki maujuuda kanoon main sanshodhan karne yaa koi aavashyak vidhaan banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The draft of the Bill is prepared with the help of the Ministry of Law in the Ministry of Government related to that subject
 mantrimandal ke anumodan ke baad ise sansad ke saamne laayaa jaataa he
 It can be introduced in either of the two houses of Parliament by the Minister concerned
 keval dhan vidheyak ke maamle main yah pabandi he ki vah rajyasabha main pesh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Bill has to go through various stages in Parliament before it takes the form of an Act
 prayek vidheyak ke prayek sadan main teen vachan hote hai
 That is, first reading, second reading and third reading
 vidheyak ‘pesh karnaa,’ vidheyak kaa pehla vaachan he
 According to custom, this stage is not discussed
 vidheyak kaa doosraa vaachan sabase adhik vistrut evam mahatvapurn avasthaa he kyonki isi avasthaa main isaki vistrut evam baariki se jaanch kii jaati he
 When the House considers and approves all sections of the Bill and the schedules, if any
 tab mantri yah prastaav kar saktaa he ki vidheyak ko paas kiya jaae
 This is called the third reading
 jis sadan main vidheyak pesh kiya gaya ho usamen paas kiye jane ke baad use sahmati ke liye duusare sadan main bheja jaataa he
 There the bill then passes through all three stages
 kisi vidheyak par donon ke bich asahmati ke kaaran gatirodh hone par ek asaadhaaran sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 Which is resolved in the joint sitting of the two houses
 jab donon sadanon dwaara koi vidheyak alag alag yaa sanyukt baithak main paas kar diya jaataa he to use raashtrapati ke paas bheja jaataa he
 If the President grants permission, the Bill becomes an Act from the date of the assent
 sanshodhan ke dwaara samvidhan ke kisi bhi anuchhed main badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 But according to the decision of the Supreme Court, no change which can destroy or reduce the basic structure or fundamental elements of the Constitution can be made
 sansadeey visheshadhikaar ve vishisht adhikaar hai jo sansad ke donon sadanon ko, uske sadasyon ko or samitiyon ko praapt he
 Privileges are given with the view that both the Houses of Parliament, its committees and members can function independently
 unki garima bani rahe, parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki kanoon kii najaron main saadhaaran nagarikon ke mukaable main visheshadhikaar praapt sadasyon kii sthiti bhinn he
 As far as the enforcement of the statutes is concerned, the members are representatives of the people as well as ordinary citizens
 mul vidhi yah he ki sansad sadasyon sahit sabhi naagarik kanoon kii najaron main baraabar maane jane chahie
 The responsibilities which belong to other citizens also belong to them and perhaps there are some more as members
 sansadon kaa sabase mahatvapurn visheshadhikaar he sadan or uski samitiyon main puri swatantraaa ke saath apane vichaar rakhane kii chhot
 No action can be taken in any court against any matter said or given by a member of Parliament
 sansadeey visheshadhikaron kii suchiyaan taiyaar kii ja sakati hai
 In fact, they have also been prepared, but no such list is complete
 thode main kah sakate hai ki koi bhi vah kaam jo sadan ke, uski samitiyon ke yaa uske sadasyon ke kaam main kisi prakaar kii baadha daale vah sansadeey visheshadhikaar kaa hanan karata he
 For example, a member cannot be arrested not only when the House of which he is a member is in session or while the Parliamentary Committee of which he is a member is in the meeting, or both
 The joint sitting of the Houses is going on, or while the joint sitting of the two Houses is going on
 sansad ke adhiveshan ke prarambh se 40 din pehle or uski samaapti se 40 din baad yaa jabaki vah sadan ko aa rahaa ho yaa sadan ke baahar ja rahaa ho, tab bhi use giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Within the premises of Parliament, no legal or criminal 'summons' can be given without the permission of the Speaker / Chairman
 adhyaksh / sabhapati kii anumati ke bina sansad bhawan ke andar kisi ko bhi giraftaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Because in the premises of Parliament only the orders of the House of Parliament or the Speaker / Chairman are followed
 yahan anya kisi sarkari praadhikari ke yaa sthaneey prashasan ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin hota
 Each House of Parliament is its own defender of privilege
 visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa sadan kii avmaananaa karne vaale ko bhartsana karke yaa taadna karke yaa nirdhaarit avadhi ke liye karawas dwaara dandit kar saktaa he
 In the case of its own members, the House can impose the other two types of punishment, that is, suspend and remove from service of the House, a member may be suspended from serving the House for a specified period
 kisi ati gambhir maamle main sadan se nikaala ja saktaa he
 The House may punish the offenders with imprisonment for a term which does not ordinarily exceed the duration of the session of the House
 jaise hi sadan kaa satravsaan hota he, bandi ko mukt kar diya jaataa he
 Due to the contempt of the House by the audience shouting slogans in the gallery and / or throwing advertisements, both houses have, from time to time, punished the offenders with imprisonment till the House adjourns on that day
 sadan kaa dandic kshetra apane sadanon tak or unke saamne kiye gaye aparaadhon tak hi simit na hokar sadan kii sabhi avmaananaaon par lagu hota he
 Whether contempt is committed by members or by persons who are not members
 isse bhi koi antar nahin padataa ki aparaadh sadan ke bheetar kiya gaya he yaa uske parisar se baahar
 This power of the House to punish persons for breach or contempt of privilege of the House is the foundation of parliamentary privilege
 sadan kii aisi panrapara bhi rahi he ki sadan kaa visheshadhikaar bhang karne yaa sadan kii avmaananaa karne ke doshi vyaktiyon dwaara spasht rup se or bina kisi shart ke dil se vyakt kiya gaya khed sadan dwaara sweekaar kar liya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the House generally decides not to take further action on such matters in view of its dignity
 donon sadanon ke sadsy aise vetan or bhatte, jinhen sansad samay samay par, vidhi dwaara tay kare, paane ke hakdaar he
 The Parliament has approved the pension of Members under the Members of Parliament Act

 In addition to the monthly salary and daily allowance, each member is entitled to a constituency allowance of Rs 3000 per month and office expenses at the rate of Rs 1000 per month

 akashganga, milky ve, kshirmarg yaa mandakini hamaari gallexi ko kehete hai, jisamen prithvi or hamaara saura mandal sthit he
 The galaxy is a spiral galaxy in shape, with a large center and several curved arms emanating from it
 hamaara saura mandal isaki shikari-hans bhujaa par sthit he
 There are between 100 billion and 400 billion stars in the galaxy and it is estimated that there will be about 50 billion planets, of which 500 million are at a distance from their stars to keep life-worthy temperatures
 san 2011 main hone vaale ek surveykshan main yah sambhaavna paayi gai ki is anumaan se adhik grah hon - is adhyayan ke anusaar akashganga main taron kii sankhya se dugane grah ho sakate hai
 Our solar system is located on the outskirts of the galaxy and is orbiting the center of the galaxy
 ise ek puri parikrama karne main lagbhag 22
5 se 25 karod varsh lag jate hai
 In Sanskrit and many other indo-aryan languages, our Galaxy is called "milky Way"
 puraanon main akashganga or prithvi par sthit ganga nadi ko ek dusre kaa joda mana jaataa tha or donon ko pavitra mana jaataa tha
 The galaxy has been called "kshir" in ancient Hindu religious texts
 bhartiya upmahadweep ke baahar bhi kai sabhyataaon ko akashganga dudhia lagi
 The word "galaxy" originates from the Greek word "gala", which also means milk
 farsi sanskrit kii hi tarah ek hind-irani bhashaa he, isliye uskaa "doodh" ke liye shabd sanskrit ke "ksheer" se miltaa-julata sajaateey shabd "sheer" he or akashganga ko "raah-e-shiri" bulaayaa jaataa he
 In English, the Milky Way is called the "milky Way", which also means "milk path"
 kuch purvi asian sabhyataaon ne "akashganga" shabd kii tarah akashganga main ek nadi dekhi
 The galaxy is called the "river of Silver" in Chinese and also "mirinae" in Korean
 akashganga ek sarpil gallexi he
 The diameter of its flat circle is about 100,000 light-years but its thickness is only 1,000 light-years
 akashganga kitni badi he iskaa anumaan is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ke agar hamaare puure saura mandal ke chakra ke kshetrafal ko ek rupee ke sikke jitna samaj liya jaae to uski tulana main akashganga kaa kshetrafal bharat kaa dedh guna hoga
 It is estimated that there are at least 1 trillion stars in the galaxy, but it is possible that the number may be up to 4 trillion
 tulana ke liye hamaari padosi gallexi andromeeda main 10 kharab taare ho sakate hai
 Andromeda also has a spiral shape
 akashganga ke chakra kii koi aisi seemaa nahin he jiske baad taare ekadam na hon, balki seemaa ke paas taron kaa ghanatv dhire-dhire kam hota jaataa he
 It has been observed that after a distance of 40,000 light years from the center, the density of stars starts decreasing rapidly
 vaigyanik iskaa kaaran abhi thik se samaj nahin paae hai
 Outside the main arms, there is a ring of stripped wires from another galaxy over a period of years, called a unicorn ring
 akashganga ke ird-gird ek gallexic sehara bhi he, jisamen taare or plasma gas kam ghanatv main maujuud he, lekin is sehre kaa aakaar akashganga kii do majalanic badal naam kii upgrahiy gallexiyon ke kaaran simit he
 Because humans are located within the circle of the galaxy, we have not been able to infer its exact shape
 ham puure akashganga ke chakra or uski bhujaaon ko dekh nahin sakate
 We get a full view of thousands of other galaxies in the sky, from which we get to know the different categories of galaxies
 akashganga kaa adhyayan karne ke baad ham keval anumaan laga sakate hai ke yah sarpil shrenee kii gallexi he
 But it is very difficult to find out how many main and how small asterisks the galaxy has
 upar se yah bhi dekha gaya he ke anya sarpil gallexiyon main bhujaayen kabhi-kabhi ajeeb dishaao main mudi hui hoti hai yaa phir vibhajit hokar upabhujaayen banati hai
 Scientists differ in the size of the arms due to these intricacies
 2008 tak mana jaataa tha ke akashganga kii chaar mukhya bhujaayen hai or kam-se-kam do choti bhujaayen hai, jinamein se ek shikari-hans bhujaa he jisapar hamaara saura mandal sthit he
 a picture on the right shows different arms in different colors - 2008 main visconsin vishvavidhyalay ke robert banjamin ne apane anusandhan kaa nateeja ghoshit karte hue daawa kiya ke darasal akashganga kii keval do mukhya bhujaayen hai - parasius bhujaa or skutem-santoras bhujaa - or baaqi sari choti bhujaayen hai
 If this is true, then the size of the galaxy will be different from Andromeda and will be like a spiral galaxy named NGG 1365
 1990 ke dashak tak vaigyanik samajha karte the ke akashganga kaa ghanaa kendriya bhaag ek gole ke akar kaa he, lekin phir unhen shaq hone laga ke uskaa aakaar ek mote danda kii tarah he
 Photographs taken from the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2005 made it clear that his fears were correct: the center of the galaxy was actually a dandenoid shaped more than a sphere
 2007 main akashganga main ek "echi 1523-0901" naam ke taare kii aayu 13
2 arab saal anumaanit kii gayi, isliye akashganga kam-se-kam utana purana to he hi
 Two galaxies, called large and small magellanic clouds, are orbiting the galaxy
 akashganga kii or bhi upgrahiy gallexiyaan hai

 savitri rajmahal chhodkar jangal kii kutiyaa main aa gayi
 As soon as he came, he gave up all the clothes and wore the same kind of clothes as his father-in-law and husband, and started spending all his time in the service of his blind mother-in-law
 satyavan kii mrityu kaa din nikat aa pahunchaa
 Satyavan used to go to cut wood in the forest for Aginhotra
 aaj satyavan ke mahaprayan kaa din he
 Savitri is worried
 satyavan kulhadi uthaakar jangal kii taraf lakdiyaan kaatane chale
 Savitri also urged very much to follow along
 satyavan kii sweekruti paakar or saas-sasur se ajna lekar savitri bhi pati ke saath van main gayi
 Satyavan climbed the tree cutting wood, but immediately he got dizzy and he came down after throwing an ax
 pati kaa sir apni god main rakhkar savitri unhen apane anchal se hawa karne lagi
 Shortly after, he saw a buffalo-like man with a black-skinned limb, with a string of gallows in his hand, like the sun
 usne satyavan ke sharir se phaansi kii dori main bandhe hue anguthe ke baraabar purush ko balpurvak khinch liya
 Savitri became very distraught and asked in a loud voice - o God! Who are you and where are you taking my heart? The man replied - Tapaswini! You are a pity, so i tell you that i am Yama and today your husband Satyavan's age has waned, so i am taking him away
 tumhaare satitv ke tej ke saamne mere doot nahin aa sake, isaliye main swayan aayaa hoon
 Saying this, Yamraj started walking towards the south
 savitri bhi yama ke peeche-peeche jane lagi
 Yama refused very much
 savitri ne kaha- jahaan mere patidev jate hai vahaan mujhe janaa hi chaiye
 This is the eternal religion
 yama baar-baar manaa karte rahe, parantu savitri peeche-peeche chalati gayi
 Pleased by his steadfast loyalty and patriotic religion, Yama, one by one, gave eyes to Savitri's blind mother-in-law, gave the lost kingdom, gave her father a hundred sons and asked Savitri to return
 parantu savitri ke praan to yamraj liye ja rahe the, vah lautati kaise? yamraj ne phir kaha ki satyavan ko chhodkar chaahe jo maang lo, savitri ne kaha-yadi aap prasann hai to mujhe satyavan se sau putr pradaan karen
 Yama said it with a happy mind without thinking
 vachanabaddh yamraj aage bade
 Savitri said- You are being taken to my husband and i am being given the groom of a hundred sons
 yah kaise sambhav he? main pati ke bina sukh, swarg or lakshmi, kisi kii bhi kaamana nahin karti
 i do not even want to live without a husband
 vachanabaddh yamraj ne satyavan ke sookshm sharir ko pashmukt karke savitri ko lautaa diya or satyavan ko chaar sau varsh kii naveen aayu pradaan kii

 One result of the cultural awakening of the last century was the development of modern information about Buddhism
 bharatiyon ke liye yah ek vilupt gaurav or mahima kaa pratybhigyaan tha, paashchaatya deshon ke liye apurv uplabdhi
 This salvation of learning and literature also indicated new sophistication and progress for Buddhist countries of South, Central and East Asia

 According to the prevalent Sinhalese tradition, Lord Buddha's consecration was in BC

 On the other hand, Buddha was a contemporary of Bimbisara and Ajatashatru and his coronation led to the coronation of Ashoka after 218 years
 ye tathy parinirvana ko i

 Historians often accept this view

 By this time, the era of early communication and dissemination of the Aryans in the atmosphere of Indian history was over and various "people" were replaced by "districts"
 chhathi shatabdi ke purvardh ko "shodash mahajanapadon" kaa yug kaha gaya he
 The mutual struggle of these districts under Rajadhin and Ganadhan was leading to future unity
 aaryon se purvavarti vishaal sindhu sabhyataa lupt ho chuki thi kintu uski avshisht paramparaon ke arya samaaj main kramash: aatmasatkaran kii prakriya abhi jari thi
 In the Vedic era, the inter-sync between Aryan and non-aryan cultural traditions is one of the defining events in Indian history
 jahaan is prakriya se ek ore chaaturvarnya kaa vikaas or aryabhasha se parivartan hua, vahiin duusari ore aadhyatmik kshetra main mahatvapurn nai pravritiyon kaa janm hua
 The era of Buddha was an era of intense brainstorming when Nana Brahmins and Shramans used their different views and it is natural for the historian to seek to establish the relationship between Buddha's discovery and teaching with these prevailing ideologies
 ek mat ke anusaar jo vichaardhaara upanishdon main uplabdh hoti he usee kaa ek vikaas bauddhadharm main dekhnaa chahie
 But it is worth remembering that in that era "brahman" and "shramana" were parthenivism, even Patanjali, in the context of "yeshāntha protégé: eternal: Interpretation of this Pā सूत्रini Sutra" of "brahmin Sramanam" similar to "ahinakulam" Has given an example
 at: purvokt mat ke anusaar buddha dharm ke mul ko brahman vichaardhaara ke atanrgat kintu shramanbahya maananaa padegaa, jo pramanviruddh he, athwa shraman vichaardhaara ko hi vaidic brahman vichaardhaara ke saath mul sanlagn maananaa padegaa, jo ki kam se kam jain dharm kii avaidikata ke ab nirvivaad hone ke kaaran asweekaarya he
 The origin of an independent Kshatriya tradition is imperfect
 yah satya he ki upanishdon main, gita main or buddha evam jain aagmon main anek kshatriya shaasha darshanik charchaa main bhaag grahan karte hai kintu unke mat naanaa hai evam unhen vaidic dharm ke antarbhoot athwa shraman dharm ke antarbhoot kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, it seems that although the Mahashramana should be considered to be primarily within the Shramana community and tradition, the Lord Buddha should accept that his rendering in some directions and tendency in the Upanishads indicate Vedic influence on him
 vaidic dharm mulat: pravritimargi tha, shraman sampradaay nivrittimargi
 The predominance of retirement was dependent on the use of worldism
 pakshaantar main pracheen vaidak dharm main sansarwaad avidit tha
 In some Upanishads, along with knowledge discussion, worldliness is evident at some places
 is kaaran yah praaia: pratipaadit kiya gaya he ki upanishdon ke in sthalon se hi nivrittiparak dhaaraon kaa udgam maananaa chahie
 That is, Sankhya and Yoga, Jainism and Buddhism, the origin of all should be found somewhere in the Upanishads
 is dharna ke peeche yah vishwaas he ki buddha se purvatar yug kaa athwa pratinidhi chintan upanishdon main sangruhit he
 In fact, the absence of non-availability under such historical circumstances does not prove, so such "argumentum x silencio" should be considered as a fallacy
 duusari ore, jain or buddha sabhi apana vaidic shrrin maanane ke sthaan par apana apana aagam swatantry hi ghoshit karte hai
 Archaeologists have proved that the tradition of a civilization before and in addition to the Arya Vedic tradition BC
 In the third and second millenniums, India was known, so the non-vedic or Aryate origin of various Shraman traditions is no longer impossible
 is sambhavyata ke kaaran in paramparaon ke mul kii avaidikata apatat: tattad aagmasiddh he or iske pramant: niraakaran kaa bhaar prativaadee par sthir hota he
 As far as the origins of "samsaravad" or "samkhya" etc
 are available in the Upanishads, it is possible that the influence of Dharanta on the Upanishads themselves is conceivable
 falat: jahaan pehle buddha dharm kaa vaidic mul praaia: sarvasammat tha vahaan ab puratathvik or aitihaasik khoj ke pariprekshya main is mat ko sandigdh kahana hoga
 But this does not mean that Vedic influence on Buddhism is doubtful
 vastut: yadhyapi bhagwaan buddha kii paryeshna shraman prishthbhumi main praarabdh or sambodhi main paryavasit hui, tathaapi unka tatvapratipaadan athwa deshna tatkaaleen shraman abhupagamon ko buddhistha karne par hi samajhi ja sakati he
 The basic element of the world was discovered in three main directions in Vedic thought
 ek ore purush ko jagat kaa kartta mana gaya
 On the other hand, one of the elements like water, air etc
 was called the original product of the world
 is disha main parmaarthik tatv kii kalpana sat athwa asat ke rup main bhi kii gai
 Seeing the rule of global changes in the third direction, Krita and Dharma emerged
 purush ke swaroop par vichaar karte hue kramash: sharir, indriyaan, vaak, praan, man evam gyaan ko uske moulik swaroop kaa parichaayak mana gaya
 Ultimately it has been decided that the man or soul is in the form of knowledge, one is the product of the world and Brahma is the verse, and the soul and Brahman are the integral part of knowledge and truth
 yahi aupnishadik atmadvait athwa brahmadvait kaa siddhant he
 At some places the Atma or Brahma is said to be indescribable and even beyond the truth and untruth
 upanishdon main abhasith dharm kaa siddhant prachlit karmwaad ke saath anayas sanshlisht ho gaya kyonki karm-fal-niyam hi maanav jivan evam sristi kaa gambhirtam niamak kaha ja saktaa tha
 a detailed and detailed rendering of this theory can be seen in the Nana Shramana sects whose opinions are found in the ancient Buddhist and Jain proceeds
 didhanikaay ke muvidit samanjafal suttant ke anusaar purna kaashyap, prakudh katyayan, ajit keshakambali, sanjay beldwiputra, goshaal evam nirgranth gyatruputra buddha ke samakaleen prasiddh shraman parivrajak ganacharya the
 Elsewhere, there are references to periodism, naturalism, fatalism, ignorance, intransigence, actionism, eternalism, abolitionism etc
 adhikansh vichaarak jeev ke janm se janmaantar sansaran ko du:khaatmak or karm-fal-niyam ke dwaara vyavasthit maanate the kintu jeev, karm or moksh ke saadhan ke vishay main prachur or jatil matbhed tha
 Lord Buddha enunciated the Dharmachakra only in the environment of these perceptions and tendencies of charitable and behavior propounded by Brahmin and Shramana thinkers
 buddha ke jivan ke vishay main pramanik saamagree viral he
 Most of the chronicles and scripts available in this context are variable and devotional works
 pracheenatam saamagree main pali tripitak ke kuch sthalon par uplabdh buddha kii paryeshna, sambodhi, dharmachakrapravartan evam mahaparinirvana ke alp vivaran ullekhya hai
 It is worth remembering that the Mahadadanutta of Diddhinikaya proves that at this stage the request of the Buddhists was not to display a "dharmata" or an essential and fixed order for all the Buddhas in it, rather than in the detailed historical collection of the life of Lord Buddha
 
 is kaaran gautam buddha ke jeevani sahitya main aitihaasik smriti buddhatv ke adarsh se prerit kalpanaapratanon se vaise hi aachchann ho gai jaise chaturmasya main aranyapath
 Modern descriptions of the biography of Buddha are often based on the diagnosis of Pali or the Sanskrit Mahavastu, Lalitavistar and Ashwaghosha
 kintu in vivaranon kii aitihaasikta vahiin tak sweekaar kii ja sakati he jahaan tak unke liye pracheenatar samarthan uplabdh hon
 It is mentioned that according to a new opinion, in the original Vinaya, both the biography of Buddha and the rules of Vinaya were part of the same syntactic description
 ye mat sarvatha pramanit na hone par bhi sambhavya he
 BC The birth of Lord Buddha is famous in Lumbini forest near Kapilavastu, the capital of the Shakyas, circa 563

 Ancient information about Buddha's infancy is very meager
 siddharth ke battis mahapurushalakshanon ko dekhakar asit rishi ne unke buddhatv kii bhavishyavaanee kii, iske anek varnan milte hai
 It is said that one day, in the shade of berries, he had achieved the first meditation in a natural way
 duusari ore lalit-vistaar aadi granthon main unke shishav kaa chamatkaarpurn varnan praapt hota he
 According to Lalitvistar, when Siddhartha was taken to Devitan, the devotimas got up and prostrated themselves, all the gold on their bodies appeared to be muddled, they gave the name of 64 scripts to the lip-teacher Acharya Vishwamitra and to the calculator Mahamatra Arjuna of the atomic-state: inertial calculations
 Shocked in amazement by the details and the guilt of Siddhartha, master of many crafts, astrology and arts

 In Vinaya she is simply called Rahulamata
 buddhacharit main yashodhara naam diya gaya he
 Frightened by the prediction of Siddhartha's passing, Yudhodan made three distinct prasadas for him - cosmic, annual, and mental
 inhen ramya, suramya or shubh kii sangya bhi di gai he
 Siddhartha was kept in these prasadas away from vyadhi and a little death in an artificial, perpetually captivating folk where there was an intact kingdom of music, youth and beauty
 kintu devataaon kii prerana se siddharth ko udyanyatra main vyaadhi, jaraa maran or parivrajak ke darshan hue or unke chitt main pravrajya kaa sankalp virudh hua
 The exaggeration and miraculousness of this type of doubt casts doubt on its imperfect truth
 yah nishchit he ki siddharth ke man main samveg sansar ke anivaary du:kha par vichaar karne se utpann hua
 His meditation, which has been mentioned above, must have revealed this grief feeling as a serious truth
 nidankatha ke anusaar isi samay unhone putrajanm kaa samvaad suna or navjaat ko rahul naam mila
 On the same occasion, enchanted by Siddharth on his way to Prasad, Krisha Gautami uttered a famous saga in his praise which contains the word extract
 siddharth ko is gaatha main guurvaaky ke samaan gambhir aadhyatmik sanket uplabdh hua : Nibbuta nun sa mother nibbuto nun so father
 nibbutaa nun sa nari yassiamidiso pati ti
 
 nishith ke andhkaar main soti hui patni or putr ko chhodkar siddharth kanthak par arudh ho nagar se or kutunbajivan se nishkrant hue
 Siddhartha was 29 years old at that time
 nidankatha ke anusaar raat bhar main shakya, coliya or mall in teen rajyon ko paar kar siddharth 30 yojan kii duuri par anoma naam kii nadi ke tat par pahunche
 At the same time, he disguised himself as Pravrajya and after leaving the verses himself, proceeded towards his own peaceful peace
 arya paryeshna ke prasang main siddharth anek tapasviyon se visheshat: aalaar kalam evam udrak se mili
 The place of Arad Kalaam in Lalitvistar has been called Vaishali, while in the wisdom of Ashwaghosh, he has been described as a Vindhya leper
 pali nikaayon se vidit hota he ki kalam ne bodhisattva ko "archichanyaayatan" naam kii "alp samaapatti" sikhaai
 Ashwaghosh has demonstrated a numerical analogy of Kalaam's principles
 lalit vistaar main rudrak kaa ashram rajgrih ke nikat kaha gaya he
 The Bodhisattvas remained dissatisfied with Rudraka's preaching of "nave cognizance cognizance"
 rajgrih main unka magadharaj bimbisar se saakshatmar suttanipaat ke pabbajjasutt, lalitvistar or buddhacharit main varnit he
 In Gaya, the Bodhisattva thought that just as wet aranis cannot produce fire, one cannot attain enlightenment while being alive in the bhogas

 But in the end, he left the penance as meaningless

 The Bodhisattva remembered the meditational meditation experienced in infancy and sought enlightenment through meditation

 Clearly, friction must be understood as a symbolic account of victory over work and death

 ek mat se iske samanaantar hi sarvadharmabhismay rup sarvakarak pragna athwa sambodhi kaa udai hua
 There are various traditions concerning the first words of Buddha in the context of enlightenment, in which the saga "many Castes World Sanghavasis Punappunam" supported by Buddhaghosha is particularly notable
 sambodhi kii gambhirtha ke kaaran buddha ke man main uske upadesh ke prati udaseenta swaabhaavik thi
 How will worldly creatures be able to understand the serious truth which is very subtle and irrefutable? On this disinterestedness of the Buddha, Brahma requested him to initiate the Dharmachakra, upon which the Buddha found him in various stages of development, seeing the sad world
 buddha ke liye kisi vaastavik sanshay athwa abhiruchi ke udai kaa prashn nahin tha
 But it was in accordance with righteousness that as a representative of the former worlds of Deshana, Mahabrahma would ask Buddha to pray
 is prakaar brahmayachana ke prasang se pragnanuvarthita evam upadesh kii vineyapekshata suchit hoti he
 In Sage Nath's Rishipatana Mrigadava, Lord Buddha gave a Dharma Chakra by preaching to the five class monks
 is pratham upadesh main do anton kaa parivarjan or madhyamaa pratipada kii ashrayaniyata bataai gai he
 The superior of these five classes was initiated in Yash and his relatives and friends in Siddharma

 shreshthiyon main kotipati anaathpindak or vishakha upaask bane or unhone shravasti main sangh ko kramash: jetavan vihaar or purvaaram mrigarmatra prasaad kaa daan kiya
 Many Brahmins of Kosala like Agnick Bhardwaj, Pushkar Saadi etc
 also accepted Buddhism
 shakyagan pehle buddha ke anookul nahin the kintu phir chamatkaar dekhakar unki ruchi parivartit hui
 Although Buddha himself was a special admirer of the Republic of Vaishali, the propagation of Siddharma remained narrow due to the greater influence of the Nirgranthas
 magadh main bimbisar kii anukulata kadachit saddharm ke prasar main vishesh sahaayak thi kyonki yah vidit hota he ki yahan ke anek shreshthi or grihapati buddha upaask bane
 It is mentioned that on the insistence of Mahaprajapati Gautami and Anand, Lord Buddha also gave women a place in the union
 prasiddh mahaparinirvana sutara main parvarti parivartanon ke baavjood buddha kii antim padayatra kaa maarmik vivaran praapt hota he

 According to the Pali tradition the last words of God were "vyadhamma Sankhara Appamaden Edethetati
 " According to tradition, Buddha used to sit in secluded posture till the time of eternal bhiksha of morning body revival
 bhikshacharya kabhi akele, kabhi bhikshusangh ke saath karte the
 On the invitation of the devotees, they used to eat and preach at their place
 lautne par bhikshuon ko upadesh dete or phir muhoort bhar vishram kar darshanathiyon ko upadesh karte
 In the evening, after bathing meditation, the monks used to solve the problems, answering the questions of the gods in the middle yam of the night, and in the last yam of the night, Buddha did some chamkaran and some rest, and with the Buddha chakshu

 For this reason, his descent was acceptable to all sections of society and was a distinct new phase in the progress of intellectualism, morality and spirituality
 bhagavan buddha kii mul deshna kya thi, isapar prachur vivaad he
 Later Buddhists themselves were born and developed by Nana sects and all of them consider themselves to be emancipated from Buddha
 buddhavachan bhi vibhinn sampradaayon main samaan rup se sangrakshit nahin he
 And then as much as is preserved in his name, in various languages and sects, in Hinayana and Mahayana, no one can consider them all historians
 spasht hi buddhavachan ke sangrah or sangrakshan main naanaa parivartan or parivardhan avashya sweekaar karne honge or uske nishpann rup ko ek dirghakaalin vikaas kaa parinaam maanane ke atirikt aitihaasik aalochana ke samaksh or yuktiyukt vikalp nahin he
 The Mahayans conceived one and two or three Dharmachakra Pravachanas to solve this problem and on the other hand, the concept of "vinayabhedan Deshbheda:"
 arthath bhagwaan buddha ne swayan upaykaushalya se naanaa prakar kii dharm deshna kii
 Most modern scholars consider the doctrines stored in Vinaya and Sutta Pitaka under the Pali Tripitaka to be the original wisdom
 kuch vidvan sarvastvaad athwa mahayan ke saransh ko mul deshna sweekaar karnaa chaahate hai
 Other scholars seek a greater discretion in early and later theories from historical analysis of original texts, in contrast to which some other scholars often consider this type of discretion to be impossible
 matbhed hone par bhi naanaa sampradayik or aitihaasik parivartanon ke peeche mul deshna kii khoj nitant aavashyak he kyonki is mul sanlagnta par hi aadhyatmik pramanikta nirbhar he
 Lord Buddha preached in the prevailing Magadhi language and allowed everyone to remember the teachings in their own dialect
 aisi sthiti main buddha dharm ke pradeshik prasar ke saath yah anivaary tha ki buddhavachan ke kramash: anek sangrah prastut ho jaaen
 Of these, only the collection of Pali is now complete
 anya sangrahon ke kuch ansh mul rup main evam kuch anuwaadon main hi milte hai
 Thus the importance of Pali Tripitik is undisputed
 isaki pracheenta bhi asandigdh he kyonki i

 pratham shatabdi main isko sudur sinhal main lipibaddh kar diya gaya tha
 However, it is difficult to accept that Pal is Magadhi, as well as the post-buddha period of Abhidharma Pitaka is often indisputable in modern scholars
 shrimati rise davids tathaa frajchalnar aadi kii khojon se prathit hota he ki vinay evam sutt pitakon main pracheen or arvachin anshon kaa bhed sarvada upekshniya he
 For example in Vinaya the pratimoksha is ancient, the musical description is relatively Archaic, the sattanipat's sattakas in Sutapitaka and the Parayana Vaggas are ancient, the Mahapadana Sutta of the long is relatively Archaic

 In the era of Buddha, many Shramana Parivrajakas considered the world to be a sad cycle

 In contrast, modesty or sattrama, disinterest, and wisdom lead to nirvana by dismantling the tradition for the world

 This message is basically propounded in the four Aryan truths
 ek ore bhagwaan buddha ne karmtatv ko manovaigyanik vishleshan ke dwaara chittaprasut bataakar yah pradarshit kar diya ki sansarvruksh kaa beej man hi he - "manopubbangma dhanmma manosettha manomaya" or duusari ore man kii anityata or parantatrata ke dwaara uski anaatmata or heyata kaa unhone spasht pratipaadan kar diya
 The world is reputed to be in the mind and the mind is attained with the symptoms of grief, imperfection and selflessness
 mulat: chitt main nairatmya bodh ke dwaara chitthopsham hi nirvana he
 While documenting the first Arya truth, the Buddhists have rendered the three-dimensional sorrow - the sorrow which is the emotional gross sorrow, the result sorrow which is expressed by the otherwise feeling of happiness, and the sorrowful sorrow which Rites are communicative
 is sanskaradu:khata ke kaaran hi "sarvam du:kham" is lakshan kaa kahin bhi vyabhichaar nahin hota
 The conjugation of the subtle and great form of grief is possible only when spiritual sensitivity develops
 baudhon ke anusaar du:kha satya kaa saakshaatkaar hone par pruthgjan kii sthiti chhootakar aryatv kaa unmesh hota he
 The second Arya is the true realization
 prathithyasamutpaada kii anek pracheen or naveen vyakhyaayein hai
 Some interpreters have described the mamti of Pratyatmasutpad, the realization of the work-cause-feeling and its use in the spiritual realm
 avidya-sanskaar-vigyaan-naam-rup-shadaytan-sparsh-vednaa, trishna, upadan, bhav, jati, jaraa, maran in dwadash nidaanon athwa kaarnon kii parampara prathithyasamutpaada he
 According to another interpretation, Pratyasamutpada is a medium form of barring eternal and aberrant conflicting ends
 is madhyam pratipad kaa arth ek ore jagat kii pravaaharupata kiya gaya he or duusari ore sabhi vastuon ko a-yonyapekshata athwa swabhaavshoonyata bataaya gaya he
 Clearly, in these and many other interpretations, a diverse development of the original residual sense is seen
 tritiy arya satya du:khanirodh he
 The natural question here is whether there is an absence of nirvana? Nirvana has not been accepted as a sentiment in other Buddhist sects except a few Sautrantikas
 sthaviravaadi nirvana ko bhavarup maanate hai, vaibhashik dharmaswabhaav rup, yogachaar tathaa swaroop or madhyamik chatushkoti vinirmukt shunya swaroop
 It is so undoubtedly that Nirvana lacks grief, affliction and avidya
 nirvana param shant or param arth he, asanskrit, nirvikaar or anirvachaneey he
 In spiritual practice, as the mind becomes pure, effervescent and calm, it is facing Nirvana
 is sadhnanirat chittasantati kii antim avasthaa athwa lakshyaprapti kaa purvavasthaon athwa santati sambandh sthapit kar sakna sambhav prathit nahin hota
 Many remedies were invented to overcome this difficulty, and imagined specific religions named "attainment" and "non-attainment" by the Vaibhashikas
 vastut: antim avasthaa main anirvachaneeyata ke ashram ke atirikt or koi upaay nahin he
 Often the question of the affectiveness of Nirvana is intent
 pudgalvaadiyon ke atirikt anya buddha sampradaayon main aatma athwa jeev kii satta kaa sarvatha tiraskaar buddha kaa abhisht mana gaya he
 Often this type of spirituality and idealism is said to be characteristic of the Buddhist vision
 buddha darshan main aatma ke sthaan par paanch skandhon kaa anitya sanghaat sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 There are five wings - form, science, vedana, noun and samskara
 skandh santati kaa purvaapad sambandh pratithya samutpaada athwa hetu pratyay ke adheen he
 Components of Experience There is no such stable and equal element in these many and infinite elements that can be considered as soul
 aisi sthiti main karta or bhokta ke bina hi karm or bhoga kii satta manani hogi
 Or it should be said that in karma and bhoga itself, curiosity and devotionalism have to be considered as reflected or embodied
 smriti evam pratybhigyaan ko samajhane ke liye is darshan main keval sanskaar athwa vaasana ko paryaapt samajha gaya
 What can be more than the lack of experience of nirvana on accepting this kind of soullessness? In Sankhya, Yoga and Vedanta, the form of the soul is distinguished by being mindless, that is, the attainment of self-knowledge on the retirement of ignorance
 jain darshan main karmnivritti hone par jeev ko apane parmaarthik swaroop or shakti kii uplabdhi hoti he
 The question is, what remains on the ignorance or retirement of mind in non-buddhist Buddhist philosophy? Who attains nirvana? One answer to this is that the acceptance of Sarvana Sorrow should be regarded as a virtue, though dissatisfied with it, in the Vatsiputriya Yogachara sects, a self-actualized element called "pudgal" or "alaya Vigyan" was conceived
 nagarjun kaa kahana he "atmetyapi deshitanprajapitamanatmetyapi
 Buddhaita is neither chanatma kashchidityapi deshitam
 " yahan is tathy kii ore sanket he ki pracheen buddha aagam main aatmavishyak uktiyaan sab ekares nahin hai
 After considering this utterance closely, some modern scholars have proposed that the Buddha himself had created the non-existence of non-selfless elements and not the existence of the soul
 unhone yah kahin nahin kaha ki aatma he hi nahin
 He only said that the form, science, etc
 is not a winged soul
 arthath buddha kaa atmpratishedh vastav main ahankarpratishedh ke tulya he
 The lack of spirit meant by the wings is the interplay and not the extreme feeling of the soul everywhere
 isi kaaran buddha ne sanyuttanikaay main spasht puche jane par bhi aatma kaa pratishedh nahin kiya or na tathagat kaa mrityu ke ananthar abhaav bataaya
 It is worth remembering that since the soul is infinite and infinite, he does not even describe its existence because in ordinary experience the terms "asti" and "nasti" are meaningful only in the visible transit
 is drushti se aatma or nirvana par buddha ke gambhir abhipraay ko shaashvat or uchchhed se pare ek atarky madhyamik pratipad maananaa chahie
 This can be completely reconciled with his Arya silence
 chaturth aryasaty yaa nirongamini pratipad praaia: arya ashtangik maarg se abhinn pratipaadit he
 The parts of the asexual path are - right vision,
 Resolution,
 Speech,
 Action,
 Live,
 Spiritual,
 Memory and
 Samadhi
 vastut: yah ashtak bodhpakshik dharmon kaa sangrah vishesh he
 Often 37 Bodhipakshiik religions are mentioned
 prakarantar se sheel, samadhi or pragna, in teen main aadhyatmik saadhan sangruhit ho jaataa he
 Buddhaghosh has taken shelter of this sequence in "visuddhimaggo"
 yah smaraneey he ki jis kram se du:kha utpann hota he uske vipareet kram se vah apatat: niruddh hota he
 The traditional reason for grief is Avidya: Clash-karma which is progressively gross
 du:kha nivritti kii parampara main pehle sheel ke dwaara karm kaa vishodhan hota he, phir samadhi athwa bhaavana ke dwaara kleshprahaan or phir pragna athwa saakshaatkaar ke dwaara avidya kaa apaakaran
 It is irresponsible that conjunctivity is necessary even before the practice of Shilabha
 samyagdrushti swayan parokshgyanroopa he kintu saadhan kii digdarshika he
 Both modesty and samadhi are forms of restraint - gross and subtle, there is refinement of karma from the first, dilution of afflictions from the second
 sheel main safalataa samadhi ko saral banaati hai, samadhi main safalataa sheel ko purnataa pradaan karti he
 On completion of Samadhi, Pragya takes the place of Samyadrishti
 patisambhidamagg ke anusaar sheel chetana he, sheel chetsik he, sheel sanvar he, sheel avyatikram he
 Five-modalities are specified for worshipers, Darsheel is prescribed for the well-to-do shramanera, Pratimoksha Samvar, etc
 for the well-to-do monk
 panchasheel main ahimsa, astey, satya, avyabhichaar or madyanupasewan sangruhit hai
 It is worth remembering that Panchsheel is designated as Panch Vriti, such as Vrati from Pranatipat, Vriti from Adatdan etc
 cigalowad suttant aadi main upaask dharm kaa or adhik vistrut vivaran uplabdh hota he
 On attaining Pravrajya, the monk was called Shramaner and he had to live in the guise of an Upadhyaya and Acharya
 uske liye sheel main 10 viratiyaan yaa varjanaayen sangruhit hai - pranghaat se, chori se, abrahmacharya se, jhooth se, sharaab or nashili vastuon se, vikaal-bhojan se, naach, gaanaa bajaanaa or tamaasha dekhne se, maala, gandh, vilepan or alankaran se, unchi shayya or bahumoolya shayya se or sona chaandi grahan karne se
 Pindapat, Cheewar, Shayanasana, Glan suffix are called the four characteristics of the monk
 inamen kramash: atirikt laabh kii anumati bhikshujivan or sangh kii samruddhi main pragati suchit karti he
 The rules of monk life and organization are stored in Vinayapitaka
 inkaa bhi ek vikaas anumey he
 In the initial stages, there was a lot of emphasis on the monk's solitary life
 peeche kramash: awasik jivan pallavit hua
 The Chaturdish Sangh was often divided into several local Sangharams not exceeding the three limits in which the system of the Republic was functioning
 ekatrit bhikshusmooh main aikamaty, udwahika, shalakagrahan, athwa bahumat se nishchay par pahunchaa jaataa tha
 The monks gathered together for the Upasath and Pratimoksha was recited on that occasion
 pratmoksha ke aath vibhaag hai - paaraajik, sanghavshesh, aniyat, naiysargik patayantik, patyantik pratideshneey, shaiksh evam adhikaran shamath
 The number of rules under them is not the same in all sects
 kintu yah sankhyabhed mukhyat: shaiksh dharmon ke pariganan main he
 In the remaining sections, the number is often the same and is consistent with the mention of the ancient "diyattasikkhapadasat"
 prayek varg ke paath ke baad sabase teen baar poocha jaataa tha "kya aap log in dosha se shuddh hai?" apradhi bhikshu apane vyatikram kii aadeshna karte the or unpar uchit praayshchitt athwa dand kii vyavastha kii jaati thi
 Rainfall had its own rules and there was a festival called Anantara Pravarana
 buddha parampara ke anusaar parinirvana ke ananthar hi rajgrih main pratham sangeeti hui thi or is avasar par vinay or dharm kaa sangrah kiya gaya tha
 Historicity of this musical has been widely disputed among historians, but the current state of the discovery of this subject has to be said to be favorable to the historicity of this music, however it remains doubtful what references were collected on this occasion
 duusari sangeeti parinirvana sau varsh pashchaat vaishali main hui jab ki mahavans ke anusaar magadh kaa raja kalashoka tha
 At this time Siddharma was spread from Avanti to Vaishali and from Mathura to Kaushambi
 sangeeti vaishali ke bhikshuon ke dwaara prachaarit 10 vastuon ke nirnay ke liye hui thi
 These 10 things were as follows - Shringi-sala-kalpa, bi-angul-kalpa, gramantarakalpa, hawa-kalpa, allowed-kalpa, achcha-kalap, amanthit-kalpa, jalogipan-kalpa, adhika-kalpa, jatarupa-silver-kalpa
 in kalpon ko vajjiputtak bhikshu vihit maanate the or unhone ayushman yash ke virodh kaa tiraskaar kiya
 Due to this Yash's efforts led to the association of 700 Eastern and Western monks in Vaishali, in which ten things were judged against
 dipawans ke anusaar vajjiputtakon ne is nirnay ko sweekaar na kar sthavir arhanton ke bina ek anya "mahaasangiti" kii, yadhyapi yah smaraneey he ki is prakaar kaa vivaran kisi vinay main uplabdh nahin hota
 Perhaps at some point in time other music partners should consider the development of Mahasanghikas and the emergence of federalism
 duusari sangeeti se ashok tak ke antaraal main 18 vibhinn buddha sampradaayon kaa aavirbhaav bataaya gaya he
 The order of emergence of these sects is given differently in communal traditions
 udhaaharan ke liye dipawans ke anusaar pehle mahasaandhik pruthak hue
 Over the years, they were unobtrusive and Gokulik, from Gokulik to registrant, Bahulik and Chetivist
 duusari ore therwaadiyon se mahinsaasak or vajjiputtak nikle
 Dhammutatiya from the Vajjaputikas, Bhadhyatikas, Chhanagarikas, and Samnitikas, and Dharmagutikas from Mahinasakas, and Sabbatheists, Conscriptive from Sabbathists, Sanskritists and Sanskritists
 yah vivaran therwaadiyon kii drushti se he
 On the other hand, the vision of the Sarvastivists is stored in Vasumitra's perfection cycle
 iske anusaar mahasaandhik teen shakhaon main vibhakt hue
 a practical, extraterrestrial and cocky
 peeche unase bahushrutiya or prajaptivaadiyon kaa aavirbhaav hua, tathaa buddhabd ke duusare shatak ke samaapt hote unase chaityashail, aparshail or uttarshail shakhaayen nikaleen
 On the other hand, Stalists were divided into Sarvastivist or Libertarian, and Fundamentalist bodies
 mul sthavir hi himvat kehalaae
 After the emergence of Vatsiputriyas, Mahashasikas, Kashyyas, and Sautrantikas from the Sarvastivists
 vatsiputreeyon main dharmottareey, bhadrayanic, sammatiya, evam shannagarik nikaay utpann hue, tathaa mahishaskon se dharmagupton kaa aavirbhaav hua
 It is so certain from looking at these and other lists that some major neoclassical currents appeared in the second Buddhist century
 inamen mahasaandhikon ke anusaar buddha or bodhisatvon kaa janm sarvatha lokottar hota he
 Buddha's nature and all religions are extraterrestrial
 unka lokvat pratiyaman vyavhaar keval lokanuvartan hai
 His look, age and influence are immense
 unki deh anaastrav dharmon se nirmit he
 He is situated in eternal samadhi and his words seem only
 mahasaandhik prakrutibhaswar chitt ko asanskrit dharm maanate the
 Apart from Tripitaka, combined Pitaka and Dharanipitaka were also known among them
 yah praaia: sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki mahasaandhik dhara ne mahayan ke aavirbhaav main vishesh bhaag grahan kiya
 The insistence of the Mahasanadhikas was on the one hand the supernaturalism of the Buddha and the Bodhisattva, on the other, the culmination of the Arhats
 unki ek shakha kaa naam hi lokottaravaadi tha or inkaa ek pramukh granth "mahavastu" suvidit mahasaandhik, vatsiputreey, sarvastivaadee evam sthaviravaadi, ye chaar pramukhatam nikaay the
 Yuvan Chwang was found in his Vihara Bamiyan and Taranath has indicated power in his Pal era
 andhradesh main mahasaandhikon kaa vishesh vikaas hua
 The names of their "chaityaka", "pre-colonial", "non-imperial" etc
 bodies are found in the records of Amaravati and Nagarjunikond
 mahasaanghikon ke in prabhedon ko buddhaghosh ne bhi "andhak" athwa andhrak kaha he
 The names of several branches of the Vatsiputriyas are available in the records of Mathura and Aparanta
 yuvan chwang ne unke vihaar pradhanthya pashchim main dekhe the or itsig ke vivaran se iskaa samarthan hota he
 His most famous branch was that of committees
 vatsiputreeyon kaa mukhya siddhant pudgalvaad tha
 He said that Pudgal is neither separate from the wings nor integral
 aagam ke prasiddh bharhaar sutara kaa is sampradaay main vishesh aadar tha
 Pudgalism is first denied in the Kathaavastu and it has been thoughtfully propounded that this first pudgalakta is undoubtedly one of the oldest portions of Kathavatthu
 parampara ke anusaar kathavatthu kii rachana moggaliputt tiss ne ashokakaleen tritiy buddha sangeeti ke avasar par kii thi
 The Sinhalese tradition considers itself to be a tradition of original and authentic stabilism, which was distinguished by the efforts of Ashoka to reach Sinhala
 is parampara ke anusaar ashok ne apane samay main sangh kii duravastha dekhakar moggaliputt tiss kii pramukhataa main patliputra main ek sangeeti kaa aayojan kiya jisamen sthaviravaad kii sthapana hui tathaa anya virdohi maton kaa khandan kiya gaya
 The monks were also expelled from the Sangh whose eyes and cold were impure
 is prakaar ashok ke prayatnon se sangh pun: shuddh evam samgr hua
 According to tradition, Ashoka built Nana Viharas and stupas for the promotion of religion
 saath hi moggaliputt ke netritv main sangh ne naanaa dishaao main dharm ke prachaar ke liye vishesh vyaktiyon ko bheja
 Majjantik was sent for Kashmir Gandhar, Mahadev for Mahishmandal, Rakkhit for Vanvasi, Yonak Dhammarkhit for Aparantha, Mahadhammarkhit for Maharatta, Mahakrita in Yavan, Majjhim in Himavat Pradesh, Kashyapagotra, Mooldev, Sahadeva and Dundubhishnavar Suva , Mahendra, "itthia", Uttiya, Sambal and Bhadsal in Tamraparni
 yah ullekhneey he ki sanchi or sonari ke stupon se praapt abhilekhon main "satpurush maudgaliputra", himvat dundubhiswar, satpurush madhyam, evam "sarvahaimavatacharya kaashyapagotra" ke naam uplabdh hote hai jisase is is saahitiyik parampara kaa samarthan hota he
 On the other hand, there is no clear mention of the third music in Ashoka's own records
 ashok jis dharm ke prachaar kaa satat ullekh karata he use buddha dharm maananaa bhi saral nahin he
 Ashoka's religion appears to be the essence of all religions
 is kaaran itihaaskaaron kii yah praapit ukti ki ashok ke prayatnon se magadh kaa ek sthaneey dharm vishwa dharm ban gaya, ayukt prathit hoti he
 The spread of Buddhism was basically the result of the efforts of the Sangh itself, although in this process multiple great rulers contributed appropriately
 pali tripitak sinhal main raja vattagamani ke say pratham shatabdi i
pus
 main lipibaddh kiya gaya
 According to tradition, Mahendra had also brought with him stories and this was also written at this time
 ye sinhalai bhashaa main kai shatabdiyon tak uplabdh thim or unhen ke aadhaar par buddhaghosh ne apni prasiddh pali attakathaayen likhin
 Truth is righteous according to Sthavarist Abhidharma and Acharyas
 dharm naanaa or pruthak pruthak hai
 Each bears its characteristic nature and is held by the suffix for
 acharya aniruddh ke anusaar rup, chitt, chaitt or nirvana, ye chaar dharmon ke mukhya prakaar hai
 Vedana, noun and rites are stored in the Chaitas
 is prakaar yah vibhaajan pracheen panch skandh or asanskrit kaa hi parishkrut rup he
 Special expansion of the sacrament wing
 chitta kaa akushal, kushal or avyaakrit, yah trividhi moulik vibhaajan kiya gaya
 Greed, malice and fascination are unskilled origins
 kushal chitt chaturvidh he - kamavachar roopavachar aroopavachar or lokottar
 The unvarnished mind is dual and verb
 dhammsangani main kul 89 prakaar chiton kaa vivaran he
 In Pathanappakaran, the relation of religions in terms of work-cause-sense has been criticized and 24 types of studies have been given
 yadi yah vishleshan gyaan mimasaa or takr kii drushti se mahatvapoornn he to manovigyaan kii drushti se vithichitt aadi kaa vishleshan ek apurv gambhirtha or sookshmata prakat karata he
 In this type of analysis, a fixed sequence of mind processes is demonstrated
 jis prakaar ashok or tritiy sangeeti sthaviravaad ke itihaas ke mahatvapoornn ang hai, isi prakaar kanishka or chaturth sangeeti sarvastvaad ke itihaas main mahatvapurn hai
 Like Ashoka and Milind, Kanishka's name is alive in Buddhist history
 is chaturth sangeeti ke adhyaksh parshv the jo kanishka dwaara sthapit purushpur ke aashcharya mahavihar ke the
 The place of music is said to be Kundalvan Bihar of Kashmir or Kuvan of Jalandhar
 is sangeeti main parshvan ke saath 500 arhat or vasumitra ke saath 500 bodhisatwein kaa bhaggrahan kaha gaya he
 But the mention of the Bodhisattvas in this context does not seem more convincing
 tritiy sangeeti ke viruddh is sangeeti main sabhi ashtadash nikaayon kii pramanikta kaa sweekaar bataaya gaya he
 The most important and enduring work of Sangeeti was the creation of "abhidharma Maha Vibhasha"
 sarvastivaadiyon ke do bhed prasiddh hai - vaibhashik or sautrantik
 The followers of Vibhasha were called Vaibhashikas
 dharmatraat, ghoshak, vasumitra evam buddhadev vaibhashik kehalaate the
 Among them, Ghoshak was Tusharjati
 yah ullekh he ki vaibhashik jinka centre gandhar main tha
 Acharya Vasubandhu created his world-famous "abhidharmakosh" by churning Sarvastavism
 vasubandhu kaa kalnirnay prachur vivaad kaa vishay rahaa he
 The power of the two Vasubandhu should now be considered perfect but it is not proven that one of these Mahayani Acharya was the author of Rejambatrāसिa Siddhi and the other of k कोश कोश कोशa
 mukhya vasubandhu ko paanchavin shatabdi main rakhana hi pramansangat prathit hota he
 The main tenet of the Sarvastivists was "sarvamasti"
 vaibhashikon ke anusaar iskaa arth tha sab dharmon kii traiyadhvik satta kaa sweekaar
 That is, the use of the past and non-existent religions
 apatat: yah mat sankhyon ke parinamwad evam pravahnityata ke siddhant sadrush he
 But the Vaibhashikas used to accept the Sanskrit signs and prevent the eternal theme
 sanskrit lakshan chaar hai - utpaada, sthiti, vyay, evam nirodh yaa anityata
 They are virtually cooperative even in the face of emergency
 traiyadhvik dravya satta ke saath adhv bhed sthapit karne ke liye anek mat udbhavit kiye gaye jinamein vasumitra ke avasthanyathatv kaa vasubandhu ne shobhan kaha he
 Sautratikas against Vaibhashikas said that the word "sarva" should be understood as "dwadashayatan"
 vaibhashik sanskrit dharmon main rup, chitt, chaitt or chittaviprayukt sanskaar ginate the
 Apart from these, he accepted three unseen religions, Akash, majority opposition, non-majority resistance
 in sab dharmon ke kaary-kaaran-bhav ke vishleshan ke dwaara chaar pratyay, chah hetu evam paanch fal nirdhaarit kiye gaye
 Yashomitra has said on the name of the Sautrantikas, "ye sutrapapramanika na tu shastrapramanikaste sautrantika"
 " yuvan-chwang ne kumaralabdh ko sautrantik sampradaay kaa pravartak bataaya he
 The Kumarabhalds were Taxila and famous contemporary of Ashwaghosh, Nagarjuna and Aryadeva
 bhartiya darshan ke vikaas main sautraantikon kii sookshm samiksha atyant sahaayak siddh hui
 In the Panchadharmas accepted by the Vaibhashikas, the Sautrantika considered the uncontaminated and the Chittavipriyata as the preceptor
 rup unke mat se anumey ho jaataa he
 Thus Chitta and Chaitra become definite and dominant elements
 ve ek sookshm or ekares manovigyaan kii satta maanate the
 Thus the principles of the Sautrantikas paved the way for both scientificism and Buddhist justice
 hinayan or mahayan, inkaa is prakaar namakaran evam bhed mahayan kii kalpana he
 Hinayana has also been called Shravakayana, Mahayana is also known as Ekayan Agrayan, Bodhisattvayan and Buddhayan
 yanabhed mahayanasutron main aavirbhoot or mahayan-shastron main savistar pratipaadit hua he
 According to Nagarjuna, the Buddha had given his real country of authority to the Bodhisattvas, his manifest descent was deserving of inferior officials
 is prakaar yanabhed kaa aadhaar adhikarbhed evam lakshyabhed tha
 Buddhism, emptiness and mindfulness are predominant in the principle of Mahayana, on the instrument side is the Bodhisattva, in which parameters and lands are important
 hinayani kaa lakshya keval apane liye arhatv kii prapti he
 The goal of Mahayani is the attainment of enlightenment for the salvation of all beings
 yahi mahayan kii lakshyagat mahatta he or iske anukool pranidhan kii yogyata hi mahayani kaa ucchadhikaar he
 The sense of aphasia leads to the loss of tribulation and thus attains eligibility
 kintu is saadhan se gyeyavaran ke na hatane ke kaaran sarvajyata athwa buddhatv kii prapti nahin hoti
 For Buddhism, first of all it is necessary for the welfare of non-living beings to achieve enlightenment
 is bodhichitt pranidhan ke ananthar naanaa bhoomiyon main parmitaaon kaa saadhan kiya jaataa he
 Finally, enlightenment leads to enlightenment
 mahayan main bodhisattvacharya kii teen mukhya avasthaaen hai jinamein pehali prakruticharya dwividh he, gotrabhumi evam adhimukticharya
 Gotra is actually a type of temperament and spiritual tendency which is formed by the effect of pre-work
 yahi prakarantar se "adhikaar" kaa mul he
 The second stage is that of the Bodhisattva lands
 mahayan kii utpatti ke kaaran, aitihaasik kram evam desh kaal ke vishay main aikamaty nahin he
 Mahayana has given many tips in favor of authenticity and original attachment of his vision
 unka kahana he ki vaastavik buddha deshna kaa lakshan, jo vinay or sutara main uplabdh ho tathaa dharmata ke aviruddh ho, mahayan main hi he
 Here he used to take the Mahayanic proceeds from "vinay" and "sutra"
 is mat ke virdohi - or inamen adhikansh aadhunik itihaaskaar sammilit hai - mahayanik aagam ko buddhavachan nahin maan pate kyonki unki uplabdhi buddha ke yug ke bahut baad main hoti he
 But by microscopic examination it can be shown that some major Mahayanic principles are also indicated by seed in ancient proceeds
 or phir buddhavachan kaa abhipraay samajhane main dharmata kaa anulomy upekshya nahin ho saktaa or mahayan ke paksh main kahana hoga ki usne buddha ke apane jivan or saadhan ko sabake liye adarshan bataa kar apana ek anivaary mul prakat kiya he
 From the point of view of theoretical expansion and designation, it is difficult to actually call Buddha Deshna completely "hinayana" or "mahayana"
 avashya hi "hinayan" kaa vikaas pehle hua kintu uske kuch pracheen sampradaayon main aise siddhant evam pravritiyaan thim jo kramash: viksit hokar mahayan main parinat huin
 These include the Mahasanghika and Sarvastivist sects
 mahayan ke utpatti sthal ke vishay main ashtsahastrika kii prasiddh ukti mahasaanghikon ke andhra centre kii ore sanket karti he
 By the middle of the century AD, the Chinese translation of Prajnaparamita, and by that time Nagarjuna's vast Prajnaparamita Shastra had been attached to it
 sudur purv tak yah prasar or itnaa shastreey vikaas mahayan kii utpatti sambhavat: i
pus
 pratham shatabdi main suchit karata he
 It can be estimated from how vast the mahayana-sutra-rashi is that 105 sources are given in the Mahavayutpatti, in the Shiksha Samukhita there are often quotations from 100 sutras, 54 Chinese Mahayasutras divided into seven sections in the Chinese Tripitaka of Nājis
 It is mentioned
 adhikansh mahayan sahitya apane mul rup main lupt ho chukaa he tathaapi aadhunik khoj ne anek mahatvapurn sutron ko prakashit kiya he
 In this, Ashtasahastrika Prajnaparamita, Saddharmapundariq, Lalitvistar, Lankavatara, Suvarnaprabhasa, Gandview, Samadhiraj, Sukhavatiview, Karandview, etc
 are particularly noted
 unamem ashtsahastrika sambhavat: pracheenatam he or maahayanik shoonyata kaa pratipaadan karti he
 In the Siddharmapundariks, there is a representation of the opulence of the Buddha, the distinction between the Upayakaushal and Buddha-bhakti
 lankavatar yogachaar kii drushti se vishesh mahatvapurn he
 The classical form and propagation of Mahayana is of the most indebted Acharya Nagarjuna
 unke vishay main naanaa aitihaasik vivaad hai kintu yah nishchit he ki ve dakshinatya the evam ek prasiddh raja ke samakaleen the jo sambhavat: i
 duusari shatabdi kaa tha
 Many of his well-known texts are medieval statues hallucinations
 isamen shoonyata ko prathithyasamutpaada or madhyam pratipad se abhinn bataaya gaya he
 The subordination and altruism of religions is a reflection of their selflessness
 yah nisswabhavata na bharrup he, na abhaavarup
 Nihilism signifies the nullity and inexhaustibility of the ultimate
 is mat kii sthapana keval ek mat ke pratishedh ke dwaara kii ja sakati he
 Nagarjuna elaborates that the acceptance of the truth of any thing inevitably leads to opposition
 is tark pranali ko prasangapadan yaa praasangik kehete hai
 Names of Aryadeva, Bhavavivek, Budhapalit and Chandrakirti are notable among the prominent exponents of Nagarjuna's infinite nihilism
 yogachaar or vigyaanavaad ko praaia: samanarthak mana jaataa he
 It would be more correct to say that in Mahayana sutras and in the works of Maitreyanath and Asanga, Yogachara appears as a spiritual philosophy
 vasubandhu evam parvarti aacharyon ke darshanik pratipadanon main ise vigyaanavaad kii aasthaa kaa samuchit vishay maananaa chahie
 The basic sources of yoga are Sandhinirmonchan, Lankavatar and Ghanvuh

 According to Taranath and Budon, Asanga received five scriptures from Maitreya - Abhinmayalankar, Sutraalankara, Madhyamavibhang, Dharmadhimavibhanga and Mahayanthanatantra
 inamen se pehle do prasiddh granthon main bodhisattvacharya ke rup main yogachaar kii paddati evam avasthaaon kaa savistaar vivaran he
 Asanga was born in a Brahmin family of Purushpur and was the forefather of Vasubandhu

 adwayavajra ke anusaar mahayan ke do prabhed hai - parmitanay or mantranay
 In these, the interpretation of Mantraya is from Yogachara and secondary position
 mantranay hi buddha tantra athwa vajrayan kaa praan he
 In Vajrayana, the warring power of wisdom and remedy is considered as the ultimate purpose
 inhen pragna or upaay ko vajra or padam bhi kehete hai
