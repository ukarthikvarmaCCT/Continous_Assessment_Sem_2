 Conversely, in the non-zero-play game, if combined with the loss and loss, it can be more or less than zero
 shunaya-sanchay khel hameshaa pratiyogi hi hota he jabaki ashoonya-sanchay khel pratiyogi yaa gair-pratiyogi ho saktaa he
 Take the example of a game in which there are two players named 'A' and 'B'
 khilaadi 'k' ko do main se ek ank kaa chunaav karnaa he - 1 yaa 2
 Player 'B' has to choose one of three colors - red, yellow or green
 in donon ke chunaavon ko dekhakar inamen se ek ko ek raashi inam main di jaati he or duusare se utani hi raashi jurmaane main lee jaati he
 The accompanying table shows what these amounts are according to the elections
 dekha ja saktaa he ki yah ek shunya-sanchay khel he kyonki isamen jitna laabh ek ko hoga utana hi nuksaan duusare ko hoga
 Similar situations are studied in game theory
 is khel main yah ho saktaa he - It can be seen that in this both the players try very hard to understand each other's thoughts because what is a good choice for them depends on the other's choice
 is prakaar ke 'shunaya-sanchay khel' kaa hal imail borol or jon phon newman naamak ganitagyon ne prayikta ke prayog se diya tha
 Often a situation arises in the two rivals in which the habit of malice leads them to understand that if one gains something, it means that the other is losing as much
 arthath vah yah samajhane lagate hai ki unki aapasi sambandh ek shunaya-sanchay khel he
 In zero-sum games, if one side does any harm to the other, then it must try to deliver
 lekin aisa bhi hota he ki kuch sthitiyon main vastav main aapasi sambandhon kaa silsilaa ek ashoonya-sanchay khel hota he jisamen kisi ghatana se donon kaa laabh yaa donon kii haani bhi ho sakati he
 For example, there are frequent conflicts between countries over trade, but this is something that both sides can benefit from
 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects
 apane is nishkarsh kii pushti usne prayogon or ganitiya vivechanon dwaara kii he
 After this Sir Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the "inverse square law of gravity"
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The value of the force f acting between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravitational constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 maan lijie prithvi kii sanhati m he or iske dharaatal par m sanhati vaala koi pind padaa hua he
 If the Earth's body is to be condensed at its center and the radius of the Earth is r, then the attraction force acting by the body on that body: newton ke dwitiya gatinium ke anusaar kisi pind par laganevaala bal us pind kii sanhati tathaa twaran ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 Thus, the force of gravity acting on a body falling freely under the influence of the attraction of the Earth: jahaan g us pind kaa gurutvajanit twaran he, at: That is, g = the force acting on the unit code of the body
 kintu sameekaran se Hence gravitational acceleration g is also often called the intensity of gravity of 'earth'
 newton dwaara gurutvkarshan ke niyam kaa pratipaadan hone ke baad hi gurutv niyatank g kaa maan gyaat karne kii samasya ne vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan apni ore aakrisht kiya
 The reason for this was that it is one of the basic determinants of nature and is completely different from country, time and situation
 isliye ise saarvatrik niyatank kehete hai
 Also, it can also be related to the Code of the Earth
 at: prithvi kii sanhati evam ghanatv gyaat karne ke liye bhi iske maan ke gyaan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This will be clear from the following deliberation: sameekaran or main tulana karne par But the amount of earth jahaan d prithvi kaa madhya ghanatv he
 g = g p r3 d / r2 = g pr d arthath G
 D
 = 3 g / It is clear from this formula that to find the value of one of the g or D, the value of the other must be known
 atev prithvi kaa ghanatv gyaat karne se purv g kaa thik maan gyaat kar sakane kii vidhiyon kii ore vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakrisht hona swaabhaavik hi tha
 We can divide the scientific efforts made to find the value of gravity constant in three categories: is vidhi kaa avlamban karanevaalon main bugar nevil meskeline airi tathaa phon sternek ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Its principle is summarized as follows: maan lijie m sanhati kaa koi pind prithvi dwaara aakarshith ho rahaa he
 It is obvious that this attraction force will be equal to the weight w of that body
 ab yadi us pind par ek parshvik bal bhi, kisi anya brihatkaay prakritik pind dwaara lag rahaa ho to newton ke niyamanusaar parshvik bal f = f m m ' / d2 xxrep 8 


 
 yahan m’ us brihatkaay prakritik pind kii sanhati tathaa d uske tathaa chote pind ke bich kii duuri he
 If the radius of the Earth is r w = g μ r3 Dm / r2 = mμ r xxrep 11 
 On comparing equations and w / f = r d2 d / m’ meaning d = 3m’ / 4p r d2 d 
 xxrep 17 
 is sameekaran main g nahin aata
 Therefore, if other quantities are known, the mean density d of the earth will be known
 w / f kaa maan alag kai prayogon dwaara gyaat kar liya jaataa he
 Again in place of m in the equation, mg / g ie rakhane par is sameekaran se g kaa maan gyaat ho jaayga
 In 1740 AD, Booger conducted two types of experiments and tried to find the length of the second pendulum and the value of g at different heights
 ek sthaan to dakshini america ke piru naamak desh main quito naamak pathaar par chunaa
 For the difference in the altitudes of these two places, he revised the value of g obtained at sea level: for this he assumed that there was only air in between the two heights
 is prakaar gananaa dwaara pathaar ke liye praapt g ke maan or prayog dwaara praapt maan main 1 / 6983 gune kaa antar paaya
 Booger concluded that this difference was due to the attraction of the Bhupadartha contained in the 9400 feet high plateau
 is prayog ne yah sanket diya ki sampurna prithvi kaa aakarshan us pathaar ke aakarshan kaa 6983 guna he
 By calculating the attraction of the plateau, Booger estimated that the density of the Earth is 4
7 times the density of the plateau
 meskeline ne 1774 i
 main ek doosraa prayog kiya
 He set up two centers very close to the steep slopes on the north and south sides of Mount Shehalian, in the province of Perthshire, Scotland, which fall on the same meridian
 donon ke akshanshon 42

 He put a plumb in a telescope and measured the meridian meridians of many constellations from both places

 isse spasht tha ki parvat ke aakarshan ke kaaran sahulsutra donon kendron par parvat kii ore jhuk gaya
 In time, with the help of this result, Charles Hutton obtained a conclusion of 5 and 9 in the density of mountains and earth

 Airy made another experiment in 1854 AD at the Harton mine in the Southshields province of England, which was actually a modified form of the use of booger

 It can be understood as: Suppose the density of ghosts from the center of the earth to the bottom of the mine is d and from there to the top of the mine, the density of ghosts is d

 is vidhi kaa anusaran karne waalon main phon jolly, pointing aadi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 The goal was to find the value of gravity by finding the increase in the weight of the smaller body by bringing any other heavy body under it
 iskaa siddhant is prakaar he : Suppose a body of m samhita is hung by a wire from one arm of a very sensitive balance
 yadi prithvi kii sanhati m tathaa ardhavyas r ho to us pind par kaary karne vaala gurutvkarshan bal w = GM m / r2 xxrep 12

 The value of g can also be determined by another method

 a special type of mirror was used in this arrangement which increased the bending of the pedicle by 150 times
 yah pehle hi alag prayogon ke dwaara gyaat kar liya gaya tha ki tandi kitne bhaar ke liye kitni jhukati he
 From this, it was calculated by how much force the bending in the pedicle was caused by mutual attraction between the two spheres

 Henry Cavendish and Sir Charles Vernon Boys are notable names in this category of endeavors
 vastut: cavendish hi vah pratham vyakti tha jisane gurutv niyatank kaa maan adhik vishwawast seemaa tak thik-thik gyaat kar sakane kii utkrisht prayogshaala vidhi kaa anusaran kiya
 Boys contributed significantly to making this method more sophisticated and simple

 If the quantities of the small and large bodies are m and m respectively and for the unit deflection, the force of the spasm of the wire is, then in the equilibrium state, the gravitational force of the wire is the spasm of the wire spasm
 t ho to santulan kii sthiti main, gurutvkarshan kaa balyugma = taar kii anthan kaa balyugma That is, g m m ' / d2 ́1 = T

 Therefore t = 4 p2i / T2 And by putting this value in the formula of g g = 4 p2 Id2 / mm’ i The value of g can be found when other quantities are known

 The ancient and early period of English literature can be divided into several dimensions
 yah vibhaajan keval adhyayan kii suvidha ke liye kiya jaataa he; isse angreji sahitya pravaah ko akshunnata par koi prabhaav nahin padana chahie
 English literature of the ancient era has three distinct dimensions: anglo-saxon; From Norman Vijay to Chaucer; From Chaucer to the English Renaissance period

 Apart from hunting, sea and war, he also had experience of agricultural life

 It was from these languages that English literature began in the form of poetry in the seventh century

 But by this time the anglo-saxon people had become Christians

 Therefore, valor, valor, compassion, service etc
 were also attributed to the valor and valor described in these languages
 anglo-sackson kavita kaa shuddh dharmavishyak ansh bhi in gaathaon ke rup se prabhavit he There is also an exaggeration of style with valor in these gathas
 anglo-sackson bhashaa kaaphi angadh thi
 Poets used to make it very artificial in the stories

 There is a stiffness in music or rhythm due to the abundance of vocal consonants

 It was rejuvenated after the Norman conquest that many scholars have called it inappropriate to add hereditary relations to this and subsequent poetry

 But the entire literature of this era lacks elegance chosar purv madhyadeshiy angreji kaal na keval england main hi balki europe ke anya deshon main bhi france ke saahitiyik netritv kaa kaal he
 From the 12th to the 14th century, France gave ideas, culture, imagination, stories and poetry to these countries

 Prose requires a rougher and more stable form of language

 But in spite of the morphological instability, the religious and romantic prose of this era developed the tradition of anglo-saxon prose from the point of view
 chosar ne is yug kii kavy parampara ko aadhunik yug se samanvit kiya
 He took elegance from French poetry and 'modern perception' from contemporary poetry in Italy
 kavita main yatharthwaad ko janm dekar usne angreji kavita ko europe kii kavita se bhi aage kar diya
 Therefore, to understand it, it is necessary to know the literary movement of medieval France and modern Italy instead of the old anglo-saxon world and its poetry

 In this era, the form of prose flourished through translations and original works of Latin and French literature

 tikoni frem ke banane main dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki uski naliyon kii madhya rekhaayen ek hi samtal main rahen
 The front steering end of the frame, the handle stalk, and the front lines of the front tongs should coincide
 donon taru ke chimaton kii bhujaayen bhi unki madhya rekha se samamit tathaa samaantar honi chahie
 The mid-line of the wheels should coincide with the mid-line of the tongs, otherwise the bike will not be able to remain straight while remaining balanced
 pahiyon main aajkal naabhi kii sparsheey disha main are lagane kaa rivaaj he
 Tactile arrears, deceptive forces can be well applied to the wheel circle
 prayek do asann are kaichinuma lagakar, hub kii flaj se sparsheey disha main jhuke rahete hai
 The rear wheel takes 40 and the next 32 holes, so accordingly holes are made in its circles and half the number of holes are made in each flange of the hubs
 chakkaa taiyaar karte samay vyasabhimukh aath aron ko pehle lagaakar sahi kar lete hai, phir shesh aron ko usee kram se bharte jate hai
 In the pictures, the flanges on the left side of the hub are shown with the arrows, which are seated in odd numbered holes on the circle
 sam sankhyankit chhedon main dahini taraf kii flanz ke are baithenge, at: unke sthanon ko khaali dikhaaya gaya he

 prayog karte samay bhi pahiyon ke aron kii samay samay par pariksha karte rahanaa chahie, koi ara dhilaa or koi adhik tanaav main nahin hona chahie
 If everyone is seen playing with a finger, a sound should be emitted from them, otherwise the wheels will start to get broken after breaking
 unhen kasne kaa kaam ghere par lagi nipalon ko uchit disha main ghumaakar kiya ja saktaa he
 For a bicycle to work properly, it is necessary to pay attention to its ball bearings
 yadi kisi bering main se zaraa bhi awaz nikalati ho to avashya hi usamen koi kharabi he
 Open it and count the pills on both sides, wipe it with a cloth and brighten it
 yadi koi goli tuuti, chatkhi yaa ghis gai ho to use badal dijie, phir uski katori ke valayakaar khaanche tathaa konon ko dekhie
 They should not be worn, cut, or rough
 yadi kharaab hon, to unhen bhi badal dijie
 If there is no AB above and the pills are also of the same number and the same size, then the lack of oil in it should be understood
 bering ke kisi bhi bhaag main kisi bhi prakaar kaa kachra yaa keechad to hona hi nahin chahie
 It is fitted in the rear wheel, by which the rider can change the ratio of the speed of the bicycle to his will and need
 aajkal teen chaal denevaale giar habon kaa adhik prachaar he
 Such a gear navel is also made that the rear, ie inverted, brakes the paddle
 chaal badalane ke liye zanjeer chakra or naabhi ke bich kii chaal ke anupaat ko, naabhi kii dhuree ke madhya lagi baarik kadiyonwali ek zanjeer ko khinchakar badal diya jaataa he
 Pulling it changes the position of the gears inside the navel
 zanjeer ko khinchne kaa kaam to savaar apane liveron dwaara jor lagaakar karata he, lekin waapas lautne kii kriya naabhi ke bheetar lagi kamaani dwaara swat: hi ho jaati he
 To open the umbilical part, one should first open the left hand cone, then open the ring of bullets on the right hand side
 peeche ke chakke par iske laga dene se savaar jab chaahe pair chalaanaa band kar saktaa he, phir bhi vah pahiyaa aazaadee se ghumta rah saktaa he
 It is of two types, one with friction cylinder and the other with ratchet tooth
 prayek mukt chakra main yah gun hona chahie ki bhitari purjon ke atak jane se pedal kii zanjeer par khinchaav na paidaa ho or dubaara jab pedal chalaae jaaen tab bhitari purje ek dam aapas main jutakar kaam karne lagen or phisalein nahin
 Also, the texture of the wheel should be impervious to dust and water
 aajkal ratchet daant yukt mukt chakra kaa hi adhik prachlan he
 On the inner periphery of its enclosure, ratchet teeth are severed, wherein the dogs stuck in place, through a chain of paddles, convey the stretch given by the rider to the navel of the wheel
 pedal chalaanaa band hote hi zanjeer thahar jaati he tathaa ve kute kamaani ke jor se rechat ke daanton main baari baari se girte hai, jisase "katkat" kii aawaaj hoti he
 If the free cycle starts slipping, or gets jammed when running again, the first trick to correct it is to fill the wheel empty with plenty of kerosene, and when all that oil is gone, then give lubricating oil to it
 yadi aib dur na ho, to chakra ke dhakkan ko khol kar dekhnaa chahie ki kahin kute ghis to nahin gaye hai, athwa unki kamaniyaan hi tut gai hon
 Then it should be cleaned completely from within and replacing the broken parts or tablets with new ones, the bangles of the lid should be tightened carefully
 tair ko pahie ke ghere par jamaaye rakhane ke liye iske donon kinaaron par yaa to ispaat ke tarayukt, athwa rabar kii hi kathor gonth bana di jaati he, jo chakke ke ghere ke mude hue kinare ke neeche dabakar ataki rahati he or bhitari rabar nalee main hawa bhar dene se tair tanakar yathasthaan baith jaataa he
 The inner hose should be filled with the same pressure so that the tires bear the burden of the rider and the wheels do not hit the road pebbles, otherwise there will be a fear of the hose being crushed and tires broken
 aavashyaktaa se adhik hawa bhar dene se tair kaa lacheelaapan kam hokar bisical sadak par uchhalati hui chalati he, lekin aavashyak maatra main kasakar hawa bhar dene se pahie kaa vyas apni seemaa tak bad jaataa he or acchhee sadak par chalate samay pedal se kam maatra main shakti lagaani padati he
 Bud's air wall is often used to fill the air in the inner tube, the design of which is clearly shown in Fig

 rabar kaa valb tub fata, kuchlaa or sada galaa nahin hona chahie
 The cap on the upper end of the hair plug should always be on
 balve kaa aadhaar nat ghere par sakhti se ksaa rahanaa chahie
 The plug of the valve, including the rubber valve tube, should enter into the grooves without interruption
 pedal craikon ko unki dhuree se cotteron dwaara hi joda jaataa he
 If the crack or axle becomes bent due to bicyclic fall, or accident, the cotter should be removed to dislodge the cranks, by opening the cotter nut attached to it, by hammering the churid end of the cater with a hammer, but attention
 Be careful not to spoil the bangles
 crank ke vaksh ke neeche lohe kii koi laag lagaakar hi cotter thonknaa chahie, anyathaa crank dhuree yaa ball bering par jhatka pahunchega
 If the two cranks are not in a straight line due to a malfunction, the flattened portion of the cotter should be sanded, or overturned
 yadi crank apni dhuree par dhilaa ho, to cotter ko adhik gaharaai tak thokane se bhi kaam ban jaataa he
 For a long time, both the cotter and the crank hole are cut and the axis of the spindle also gets damaged due to running the bicycle with loose couture
 at: nayaa cotter badalanaa hi acha rahata he
 Often the paddle pin is curved as a bicycle falls
 aisi haalat main pedal ke baahar kii taraf vaale vering kii topi utarkar uskaa samanjak cone nikaalkar goliyaan haath main le leni chahie
 Then the frame of the paddle should be moved and the inner wiring tablets should be taken and the paddlepin will remain in the crank
 uskaa nirikshan kar tathaa guniyaan main sidhaa kar, pedal ko yathapurv band dena chahie
 It is made by chained small petal links, cylinders and rivets
 ise saaf kar, tel kii chiknayee dekar or uske khinchaav ko sanmajit kar thik haalat main rakhana chahie
 The loosening of the chain's reverse joints and wear of the cylinders increases its overall length
 pedal ke dantachakr ke daanton kaa pich to badalata nahin, at: zanjeer chakra se utar kar takalif detii he
 The idea is that in the middle of the tangent of the chain mounted on the letter, it is pulled outward with a thumb and index finger
 yadi zanjeer lagbhag inch hi khinchati he, tab to thik he or yadi inch tak khinch jaati he to avashya hi ghiskar dhili ho gai hogi
 Therefore, it should be changed
 pahiyon ke gheron par dabaav daalanevaale hastchalit brikon kii karypranali liver or dandon ke sambandh par aadhaarit hoti he
 Bowden's brakes are based on a stretch of an incompressible wire mounted in a flexible steel tube
 brikon ko chhudaane ke liye kamaani kaam karti he
 Brakes are the main safety device, so brake poles should be harmonized, ie they should not be stuck in the arrows or tires
 danda majboot hone ke saath saath saralata se jodon par ghoomanevaale hone chahie
 Good looking and parts should also be neat and clean
 birsa munda vimaanashetra jharkhand sthit hawaldda he

 mapevidya yaa maapvigyaan main maapan ke sabhi saidhantik or vyaavhaarik pahaluon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 It is the science of measurement and its applications
 maapvigyaan bhautikee kii vah shakha he jisamen shuddh maap ke bare main hamen gyaan hota he
 In metrology, basically we discuss about the three quantities, that is, mass, length, and time, and with the knowledge of these three quantities, we measure other quantities, such as density, volume, force, and power
 maapvigyaan dwaara aparivartaneey maanakon kaa nirdesh hi nahin miltaa, varan inhen kaayam bhi rakhaa jaataa he
 By these standards, we also measure and compare the properties of objects
 doosraa paksh yah he ki kisi kaarivishesh ko drushti main rakhkar maapvigyaan se aise tareeke praapt hote hai jinase tulanaayen kaaphi ucch str kii shuddhta tak kii ja saken
 In the modern sciences and industries, the above basic comparisons must be very pure
 maap purnataya thik nahin hoti or nishchit rup se usamen kuch na kuch praayogic galati sadaa hi rahati he
 Nowadays the following approximations of accuracy are found in the more fundamental functions of metrology: antarrashtriya adirup kilogram ke do platinum iridium namoonon kii tulana main : 10,00,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Compared to ordinary chemical weights: one part in 10,00,000
 sookshmmapi tula dwaara chote chote bhaaron kii tulana main : 10,00,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Compared to two yards or standard meters: one part per 1,00,00,000
 antya maanak kii rekhamanak se tulana main : 10,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Determination of normal volume and density: one part per 10,000
 antya maanak ke kulak ke anshankan, 1 inch kii lambaai se kam nahin main 10,00,000 main ek bhaag
 0
 xxrep 5 0 5 inches, or 0
0001 millimeters, in full length posts of calibration of marked yards or subdivisions of metal scales
 saadhaarant: prayog main aanevaale maanakon ke liye is vishay ko maap or taul sheershak lekh main dekhen
 Wavelength as a natural standard - subsequent progress has changed our beliefs to a great extent
 sarvapratham, vaigyanik micelson ke prayogon ne ek prakritik maanak, kaa tarangadairdhya, sthapit kiya, jo sarvasammati se maan liya gaya yah maanak kam se kam utani hi ucch str kii shuddhta ke saath punarutpaadaneey he jitani dravyatmak maanakon kii tulanaaon main paaya jaataa he
 But the best feature of this standard is that it is beyond the possibility of long-term variance, whereas all other types of standards are used
 prithvi ke kisi bhi bhaag main ham is prakritik maanak kii sahaayta se dravyatmak maanakon kaa satyaapan kar sakate hai
 If the fluid parameters are to be compared to the prototype meter by sending it to the international central laboratory, then there is a possibility of loss in traffic, but with the help of natural standard we can do this work in our own laboratory
 duusari baat yah he ki is prakaar ke sudhaaron se chapate sironvaale maanakon kaa vikaas hua
 Nowadays such punishments are also attainable, whose ends are completely parallel
 is prakaar ke dandon kii lambaaiyon ko rekhiy maanak se na nikaalkar sidhe prakaashiya vyatikaran se nikaala jaataa he
 Michelson's interferometer was also used to know how many light waves come in a standard meter and what is their number? Michaelsen identified the international meter at 150 centigrade heat and 760 mm 0 atmosphere pressure, which is housed at the International Institute of Measurements and Weights near Paris, in the cadmium red lines
 yah maan 15,53,163
5 he, jo 2 ́106 main ek seemaa tak sahi he
 Subsequent experiments by Fabri Para revealed that this number is 15,53,164
13 in a meter in dry air at 15 ° c and 760 millimeter pressure
 yadi micelson ke prayogen main jalawaashp ke prabhaav ke liye sanshodhan kiya jaay, to yah spasht hota he ki donon ke maan main koi antar nahin he
 There is evidence that the fluid standard yard has probably decreased by 0
0002 inches since its construction, but it has remained unchanged as far as the international prototype meter is concerned
 micelson tathaa fabri paro ke prayogon ne ise siddh bhi kar diya he
 The basis of their comparison was the red line of cadmium
 dravya ke sab sab maanak meter ek mishradhatu ke banaae jate hai, jiske nirmaan main 90% platinum tathaa 10% iridium naamak dhaatu hoti he
 In this type, meters are considered to be most satisfactory for basic standards
 bahut se kaaryon main, jahaan atyant hi yatharth maap kii samasya aa khadi hoti he, vahaan yah aavashyak he ki ham aise dravya kaa vyavhaar karen jiskaa tapiya prasar naam maatr kaa ho
 Such metals have been discovered and one of them is called 'invar'
 yah nikal tathaa ispaat kii mishradhatu he, jisamen 36% nikal rahata he
 The second alloy is labeled stable invar
 isamen thodaa chromium bhi hota he
 This alloy has a much lower spread than ordinary invar, even then it cannot be considered as a constant
 doosraa dravya sangalit silica he, jiskaa prasar gunank bahut hi kam he
 This material increases only 0
4 ́10-6 by one degree Celsius
 sangalit silica kaa maanak meter ek nalee ke aakaar kaa hota he, jiske sire par samaantar patt sanlin hote hai
 On its platinized plane, the lines are carved
 is maanak ke bare main jahaan tak gyaat he, isaki lambaai main koi parivartan nahin hua he
 Since this type of standard is very fragile, it was neither accepted as a fundamental reference standard nor was it practiced in daily work
 keval maapvigyaan prayogshaalaon main ise prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 No natural standard has yet attempted to define a unit code
 ham sabhi laagon ko yah gyaat he ki radio sakriy padaartho kii khoj main pehle sanhati yaa dravyaman padaarth kaa ek aavashyak sthir gun mana jaataa tha
 Changes in the codification or mass standard of weavers are possible only due to abrasion, oxidation and hygienic absorption
 yadi dravyon ke maanakon kaa sangrakshan tathaa upyog uchit saavdhaanee ke saath kiya jaay, to ye kaaphi had tak bhaar kii sthirataa kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The basic weighting standard is made of platinum and iridium alloys
 isi mishradhatu kaa upyog 'rajkeey maanak pound' tathaa 'antarrashtriya aadi praroop kilogram' ke nirmaan main kiya gaya he
 After several years when the various national copies of the kilogram were re-compared, it was found that the level of stability was up to one part in 108
 isse maanakon kii yatharyata hi nahin varan tulanaaon kii purnataa bhi parilakshith hoti he
 a second material, in which a high degree of stability of the cod is found, is called crystal quartz
 isamen trutiyaan ye hai ki iskaa ghanatv apekshaakrit kam he or yah aarta avasorak he
 These standards remove different volumes of air when comparing air codification standards
 at: sanhati ke maanakon kii tulana karne main upree utplavan prabhaav kaa vichaar avashya rakhana chahie
 If the density of the standard is low, the buoyancy modification will be high
 platinum-iridium maanakon kii aapasi tulana main jo shuddhta praapt hoti he, vah is satyansh par aadhrut he ki inkaa ghanatv adhik hi nahin varan bahut paas paas hota he
 Due to this the buoyancy modification is very less
 un bhaaron kii tulana main utplavan sanshodhan ek samasya ke rup main aa khadaa hota he jinke ghanatv main bahut antar hota he jinke, jaise platinum, quartz tathaa pital aadi
 It is necessary to weigh in an airless environment to remove this defect
 pratidin ke vyapaarik kaaryon main taul kaa kaary hawa main hi hota he or utplavan ke kaaran jo antar baaton tathaa maal main hota he, vah vyapaarik drushtikon se naganya he
 The inspectors employ the standard of the weights of brass, which has a density of 8
143, to compare the trade weights
 jab ham vayurahit vaataavaran main taul nahin karte hai, tab bhi dravyaman ke praathmik maanakon kii sahi tulana ke liye tula kii banaavat uttam, prayog kii reeti daksh tathaa satark honi chahie
 To keep the zero plate reading constant, it is necessary to take utmost care in temperature stability
 isaliye jis kaksh main tula rakhi ho usko taap sthaapakiy reeti se niyantrit hona aavashyak he or nireekshak ko taulne kaa kaary kaksh se baahar se karnaa chahie, yaa use kuch duuri se taulnaa chahie
 The use of weights should be done by mechanical control from outside the balance, or by driving with long rods
 tula kii tandi kaa sanchalan yaa to doordarshee se dekhnaa chahie athwa paimaane ke aar paar tandi se lage hue shishe se paravartit hote ek prakashpunj kii maapni par gati se
 The effect of heat is minimal on the bent, so it is necessary that the stem of the invar is brought into practice, but that the inwar is somewhat magnetic
 yadi atyant ucch str kii shuddhta kii aavashyaktaa ho, to yah aavashyak he ki tula kii tandi chumbakeey prabhaav se purnataya prachhann ho or tula ko ek lohe ke baks main rakhaa jaae
 Small weights are used for weighing small quantities and especially in comparison to the densities of gases, which are made of fully reinforced quartz
 is prakaar kii tulaon dwaara 108 main ek bhaag kii shuddhta tak 1 / 10 gram bhi taula ja chukaa he
 Diseases are animals that spread infectious diseases from a patient to a healthy person

 The literature of Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi is the beginning of modern Hindi literary history
 iskaa pehla charan bharatendu-yug he evam doosraa charan dvivedi-yug
 Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi was a litterateur who, besides being a multilingualist, was equally interested in subjects other than literature
 unhone saraswati kaa atharah varshon tak sampadan kar hindi patrakarita main ek mahaan kirtiman sthapit kiya tha
 He was the first systematic critic of Hindi, who wrote several books of criticism
 ve khadi boli hindi kii kavita ke praarambhik or mahatvapurn kavi the
 The modern Hindi story was recognized as a literary genre through his efforts

 Ultimately, he was the eugenicist or, in other words, the creator of the era
 ve apane chintan or lekhan ke dwaara hindi pravesh main nav-jaagran paidaa karne vaale sahityakar the
 Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi was the first Hindi writer to receive the title of 'acharya'
 iske purv sanskrit main aacharyon kii ek parampara thi
 In May 1933, the Nagari Pracharini Sabha greeted Dwivedi by organizing a big literary event in Banaras on his seventieth anniversary, and was dedicated to him by publishing the Dwivedi Abhinandan Granth in his honor
 is avasar par dvivedi ji ne jo apana vaktavy diya tha, vah ‘aatm-nivedan’ naam se prakashit hua tha
 In this 'self-request' he says, "I have received the title of Acharya
 kyon mili he, maaloom nahin
 i do not know who gave it and when
 maaloom sirf itnaa hi he ki main bahudhaa-is padavi se vibhooshit kiya jaataa hoon

 Then how did i become a master of this title? ”mahavir Prasad Dwivedi had studied up to matriculation
 tatpashchaat ve railway main naukari karne lage the
 At the same time, he set the principles for himself - to ban time, not to take bribe, to do his work honestly and to keep trying continuously for the growth of knowledge
 dvivedi ji ne likhaa he, ‘‘pehle teen siddhanton ke anukool aacharan karnaa to sahaj tha, par chauthe ke anukool sachet rahanaa kathin tha
 However, due to regular practice, they succeeded in that as well
 tarababu hokar bhi, tikat babu, malbabu, stesan master, yahan tak ki rail patariyaan bichaane or uski sadak kii nigaraanee karanevaale plate-layer tak kaa bhi kaam maine sikh liya

 "dwivedi ji was reinstated in the Railways at Rs
 15 per month and when he left the job in 1904 AD, at that time he would get Rs
 150 as basic salary and Rs
 50 allowance, that is, a total of Rs
 200
 us jamaane main yah ek bahut badi raashi thi
 He was reinstated in the railway at the age of 18
 unka janm 1864 i
 main hua tha or 1882 i, se unhone naukari prarambh kii thi
 While working, he lived in Ajmer, Bombay, Nagpur, Hoshangabad, Itarsi, Jabalpur and Jhansi cities
 isi dauraan unhone sanskrit evam brajabhasha par adhikaar praapt karte hue pingal arthath chandashastra kaa abhyaas kiya
 He wrote his first book in 1895 AD, Srimahimnastotra, which is a poetic adaptation of Pushyadanta's Sanskrit poetry into Brajbhasha
 dvivedi ji ne sabhi padyarachanaon kaa bhavarth khadi boli gadhy main hi kiya he
 He wrote in its role, "I am deeply grateful to Babu Harishchandra Kulshreshtha, who is in Hushangabad, Babu Harishchandra Kulshrestha, in the Madhya Pradesh capital of Madhya Pradesh
 ’’ apane ‘aatm-nivedan’ main unhone likhaa he, ‘‘bachapan se meraa anuraag tulsidas kii ramayana or brajvasidas ke brajavilas par ho gaya tha
 i had also done hundreds of poetry poetry

 While there, i read the text of Pingal from a gentleman named Babu Harishchandra Kulshrestha, who was employed in the same office

 In 1896 AD, he made a seminal original adaptation of Lord Bacon's essays in Hindi, which are compiled in the book bacon-socha-ratnavali
 1898 i
 main inhone hindi kalidas kii aalochana likhi, jo hindi kii pehali aalochanatmak pustak he
 In 1988, he wrote a critical and exploratory book titled nishadh-charit-charcha on the title of Sriharsh
 yah silsilaa jo shuru hua, vah 1930-31 i
 tak chalaa or dvivedi ji kii kul pacchasi pustaken prakashit huin
 From January, 1903 to December, 1920, he had established a record by editing a monthly magazine called Saraswati, hence this period is known as 'dwivedi-era' in Hindi literature
 apane prakand paanditya ke kaaran inhen ‘acharya’ kaha jane laga
 About his personality, Acharya Kishori Das Vajpayee wrote, "seeing his strong huge and magnificent body, the viewer used to get terrorized and it seemed that i had come under a great knowledge
 ’’ dvivedi ji kaa maananaa tha ki ‘gyaan-raashi’ ke sanchit kosh kaa hi naam sahitya he
 'dwivedi ji himself was a' great knowledge-zodiac ', as well as his entire universe is also a accumulated knowledge, through which to pass through the world tradition while assimilating his ethnic tradition
 dow ramvilas sharma ne dvivedi ji ke mahatva ko pratipaadit karte hue likhaa he, ‘‘dvivedi ji ne apane sahitya jivan ke aarambh main pehla kaam yah kiya ki unhone arthshaastra kaa adhyayan kiya
 The book he painstakingly wrote and which is larger in size than his other books is property science
 xxrep 5 
 arthshaastra kaa adhyayan karne ke kaaran dvivedi ji bahut-se vishyon par aisi tippaniyan likh sake jo vishuddh sahitya kii seemayen laangh jaati hai
 With this, he studied political subjects and wrote articles on important political events happening in the world
 raajnneeti or arthshaastra ke saath unhone aadhunik vigyaan se parichay praapt kiya or itihaas tathaa samajashaastra kaa adhyayan gaharaai se kiya
 With this, he paid attention to the ancient philosophy and science of India and tried to know where we have progressed in our thinking and where we are backward
 is tarah kii taiyaari unase pehle kisi sampadak ne na kii thi
 As a result, he proved to be the most suitable person for spreading new social consciousness in Hindi entry
 ’’ Acharya Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi was the master of such great wisdom
 kintu ramvilas sharma ke purv jitne bhi aalochak hue, unhone dvivedi ji kaa uchit moolyankan to nahin hi kiya, apitu unka avamulyan hi kiya
 Among these great critics are Ramchandra Shukla, Nandadulare Vajpayee and Hazari Prasad Dwivedi
 ramachandra shukla ne hindi sahitya kaa itihaas main dvivedi ji par jo tippanee kii he, us par ek najar daalen, ‘‘dvivedi ji ne san 1903 i
 main saraswati ke sampadan kaa bhaar liya
 Since then, he devoted all his time to writing
 likhane kii safalataa ve is baat main maanate the ki pathak bhi usase bahut-kuch samaj jaaen
 In addition to many useful books, he also wrote a lot of retail articles
 par in lekhon main adhiktar lekh ‘baton ke sangrah’ ke rup main hi he
 Very rarely do essays originating new ideas come with the new power of language miracle
 sthaayee nibandhon kii shrenee main chaar hi lekh, jaise ‘kavi or kavita’, ‘pratibha’ aadi aa sakate hai
 But they do not seem written from the point of view of writing or subtle thought
 ‘kavi or kavita’ kaisaa gambhir vishay he, kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin
 But very thick things have been said about this subject very broadly
 ’’ isi prasang main ramachandra shukla aage likhte hai, ‘‘kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin ki dviveji ji ke lekh yaa niabandh vichaaratmak shrenee main aayenge
 But that esoteric secret tradition of thought is not found in them, which will stimulate the reader's intellect and run on some new thought process
 shuddh vichaaratmak nibandhon kaa charam utkarsh vahi kaha ja saktaa he jahaan ek paragraph main vichaar dabaa-dabaakar kase gaye hon or ek-ek vaakya kisi sambhddha vichaarkhand ke liye hon
 In reading Dwivedi ji's articles, it seems that the writer is writing for the readers of very thick wisdom
 ’’ Now you see that any reader of Hindi will be disgusted or enamored by reading this comment of Ramchandra Shukla towards the writing of Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi
 ramachandra shukla ke itihaas ko hindi ke vidhyaarthee saath-pansth varshon se aapt vachanon kii tarah yaad karte aa rahe hai
 In this case, if the test is not done by matching their contrasting sentences with the original text, it will be disastrous
 ramachandra shukla hindi ke sabase bade samalochak, sabase bade saahityetihaas-lekhak hai
 In this history, he accepts the historical contributions of Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi as the only language-refiner
 unke shabd hai, ‘‘yadhyapi dvivedi ji ne hindi ke bade-bade kaviyon ko lekar gambhir sahitya samiksha kaa sthaayee sahitya nahin prastut kiya, par nai nikali pustakon kii bhashaa kii khari aalochana karke hindi sahitya kaa bada baari upkaar kiya he
 If Dwivedi did not stand up, his tradition would not stop soon as disorganized, grammatical, and ludicrous language was seen all around
 uske prabhaav se lekhak saavdhaan ho gaye or jinamein bhashaa kii samaj or yogyata thi unhone apana sudhaar kiya
 "in fact, the criticism-method used by Shukla ji is writing the above things, it is called Judicial Criticism in English and Judicial Criticism in Hindi and its biggest flaw is that in the field of its criticism, the attention of critics is historical era, atmosphere
 And has removed most of life from art
 kalapaksh kii ore dhyaan dene vaale aalochakon kaa kahana hai ki yugin paristhitiyaan, yugin chetana or yug satya nirantar parivartansheel hai atev inhen aadhaar nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Due to their variability, they can be accepted as permanent standards of literature
 lekin isi ke saath yah bhi satya he ki aisi dasha main nirnayaatmak aalochana kaa koi mulya nahin rahegaa
 The main reason for this is the issuance of fatwa on the creator and composition of such critic
 yahi kaaran he ki ramchandra shukla ne dvivedi ji ke vichaaron ko, unke sanchit gyaan-raashi par dhyaan nahin diya or unki bhashaa par vichaar kiya
 'fatty words very broadly' - This is the system of expression being talked about, which is undoubtedly language
 jab dvivedi ji murkh yaa mote dimaag waalon ke liye likhte the or moti tarah se likhte the to unhone bhashaa parishkar kaise kiya ? jis lekhak ko bhashaa kii satahi samaj hogi, vah duusare lekhakon kii bhashaa ko durust kaise karegaa ? pun: ramachandra shukla kii baton par vichaar karen-mahavir prasad dvivedi ne shaashvat sahitya yaa sthaayee sahitya nahin likhaa
 Their importance is in language improvement and how is their language - it is for the Fat Sikhs
 is tarah kii baton se acharya shukla kaa itihaas bharaa hua he
 Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, while writing a review of the hindi-navratna, wrote, "if such things are found in the book of a history car, then the importance of its history cannot remain undiminished
 itihaas-lekhak kii bhashaa tuli hui honi chahie
 He should not say meaningless things
 atishyoktiyaan likhnaa itihaaskaar kaa kaam nahin
 He should understand and use the meaning of each word and phrase well
 ’’ In 1933, Acharya Dwivedi was presented Abhinandan Granth by Nagari Pracharini Sabha
 isaki prastaavna shyamsundar das evam raikrishnadas ke naam se prakashit hui, kintu yah likhi gai nandadulaare vaajapeyi dwaara
 Therefore, it is compiled in Vajpayee's book Hindi Literature: Twentieth Century, published in 1940 AD
 isamen yah vichaar kiya gaya he ki sthaayee yaa shaashvat sahitya main dvivedi ji kaa sahitya pariganit ho saktaa he yaa nahin
 This approach disqualified the entire literature written by Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi
