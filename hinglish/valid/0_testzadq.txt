 antariksh shatal orbitor kaa chitrankan Space shuttle diagram ests antariksh kaarykram profil Commonly identified in non-human zoology, the chimera is an animal found to have two or more populations of genetically distinct cells that have arisen in different zygotes of sexual reproduction; If a different cell has emerged from the same zygote, it is called mozaisism
 kymera, chaar mul koshikaon se banate hai
 Each population of cells has its own properties and the resulting animal is a mixture of tissues
 yah sthiti yaa to viraasat main milti he yaa ise pratyaropan yaa aadhaan ke dauraan allogenic hematopoatic koshika ke sat ke madhyam se hasil kiya jaataa he
 In non-homogenous twins, chimerism occurs by blood-vessel anastomoses
 ek santan ke kymera hone kii sambhaavna tab bad jaati he jab use in vitro nishechan ke madhyam se banaaya jaataa he
 Chimeras can often reproduce, but the fertility and type of progeny depends on which cell line has raised the ovaries or testicles; Different levels of intersexuality can result if one set of cells is genetically female and the other is genetically male
 tetragametic kymerawaad, janmajaat kymerawaad kaa ek rup he
 This condition occurs through the fertilization of two separate ovules by two sperm, followed by fusion of the two into the blastocyst or zygotic stage
 is kriya se mishrit koshika pankti vaale ek jeev kaa vikaas falit hota he
 In another way, chimeras are formed by the merger of two non-homogenous twins at a very early stage
 vaise, ve nar, maadaa yaa ubhayalingi ho sakate hai
 As an organism develops, it may develop organs that have different sets of chromosomes
 udhaaharan ke liye, kymera main gunasutra ke ek set vaali koshikaon se bana ek jigar ho saktaa he or dusre set ke gunasutra se bani koshikaon se bana gurda ho saktaa he
 It has occurred in humans and was once considered extremely rare, although more recent evidence suggests that it is not as rare as it is thought to be
 yah vishesh rup se marmoset ke bare main sach he
 Recent research suggests that most marmosets are chimeras, which share DNA with their respective twins
 adhikansh kymera ko jivan main yah abhas nahin hoga ki ve kymera hai
 The difference in phenotypes may be subtle or completely unknown
 Another indicator of a person's chimera is visible blaschow lines

 If blastocysts are of the opposite sex, the genitalia of both sexes may constitute either the ovary and testicles, or ovotestis in a rare form of intercourse, a condition formerly known as true hermaphroditism
 dhyaan den ki is haalat kii aavriti, kymerawaad kii vaastavik vyapaktaa kaa sanket nahin detii he
 Most chimeras composed of male and female cells probably do not have an intergranular position, as might be expected if the cell's two populations were evenly mixed throughout the body

 The genitals produce hormones that are responsible for other sexual characteristics
 yadi yon ang sajaateey hai, to us jeev se kisi bhi antarlangik lakshan pradarshan karne kii ummid nahin kii jaati he
 Natural chimeras are almost never detected unless they exhibit abnormalities such as female / male or hermaphroditic features or uneven skin pigmentation
 sabase ullekhneey kuch tortoiseshelle billi hai yaa aspasht jananaangon vaale jaanavar hai
 The chimera can show anything under a UV light spectrum, on specific markings like back that point down from the arrow pointing down from the shoulder to the lower back, this is an expression of pigment lines called asymmetry Blaschko
 kymerawaad kaa astitv, diene pareekshan ke liye samasyagrast he, jo parivaar or aapraadhik kanoon ke liye nihitarth vaala ek tathy he
 The Lydia Fairchild case, for example, was brought to court when DNA testing apparently indicated that her children could not be hers
 a charge of cheating was filed against him and his rights over the children were challenged
 uske khilaaf aarope us vakt khaarij kar die gaye jab yah spasht ho gaya ki ledia ek kymera thi, jiske garbhashay greeva ke utakon main samroop diene paae gaye
 Another case was that of Karen Keegan, who was at risk of losing her children when a DNA test for a kidney transplant showed that she was not the mother of her children

 Chimeras typically have immune tolerance for both cell lines
 sookshmkimerawaad aisi koshikaon kii ek alp sankhya kii upasthiti he jo mejabaan koshika se anuvanshik taur par bhinn hoti he
 Apparently, this phenomenon is related to certain types of autoimmune disease, however, the mechanisms responsible for this relationship are not clear
 kymerawaad, vayask seratioid englarmachalee main swaabhaavik rup se hota he or yah unke jivan chakra kaa ek swaabhaavik or aavashyak ang he
 Once a male is born, he begins his search for a female
 majboot ghran grathiyon kaa prayog karte hue, nar tab tak khojataa rahata he jab tak ki use ek maadaa englarmachalee mil nahin jaati
 iske baad vah nar maadaa ko katata he or kaati gai jagah ke aasapaas ke utak ko pachaa letaa he
 While this attachment is essential to the male's survival, it will eventually eat him, as the two anglerfish join a single hermaphrodite
 kabhi-kabhi is ajeeb rasm main ek se adhik nar ek paraseete ke rup main ek maadaa se jud jate hai
 Both of them will be absorbed into the body of the big angler female
 Once joined with a female, the males will reach sexual maturity and their large testicles will develop along with weathering of the remaining organs
 This process allows for a continuous supply of sperm when the female produces the egg, to increase the number of chimeric fish offspring
 germaline kymerawaad tab hota he jab ek jeev kii germ koshikaayen uske apane koshika se anuvanshik taur par samaan nahin he
 It has recently been discovered that marmosets can hold the reproductive cells of their twin brothers, which is caused by placental fusion during development
 jaivik anusandhan main, kymera ko bhautik rup se do alag-alag jeevon kii koshikaon ke mishran dwaara kritrim tareeke se utpaadit kiya jaataa he
 Chimeras are not hybrids, formed by the fusion of two species of gonads, forming a single zygote that develops as much as possible; In comparison, chimeras are a physical mixture of two independent zygote cells: for example, from a horse and a donkey
 "chimera" is a broad term and is often used for many types of mixtures of cells of two different species
 kuch kymera se aise vayask jaanavar kaa vikaas falit ho saktaa he jo donon daataaon kii koshika se bana ho, jo bhinn prajati ke ho sakate hai - udhaaharan ke liye, 1984 main ek bakrii or ek bhed ke bhrun ke sangyojan se ek kymeric geep ko utpann kiya gaya tha
 This "geep" played a very important role in answering basic questions about evolution, and the technology used to create it may one day prove helpful in saving endangered species
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek bakrii ke bhrun ko ek bhed ke garbh main panpane diya jaae, to bhed kii pratiraksha pranali bakrii ke bhrun vikaas ko asweekaar kar degi; lekin, agar isaki jagah ek geep kaa istemaal kiya jaataa jisamen bhed or bakrii, donon ke chihn hon to bakrii kaa bhrun jivit rah saktaa he
 This practice is possible to be expanded to prevent some endangered animal species from going extinct
 aise antarjaateey kymera ko jaise ki "geep", prayogshaala main banaaya jaataa he or shaayad hi kabhi inhen jivit sankar pashuon ke nirmaan ke uddeshy se banaaya jaataa he
 To create interracial chimeras, embryonic cells of an animal with a particular trait are produced by transplanting it into embryos of another animal with a different trait

 In August 2003, researchers at Shanghai Second Medical University in China stated that they had successfully fused human skin cells and dead rabbit eggs to create the first human chimeric embryo
 bhrun ko ek prayogshaala maahaul main kai dinon tak viksit hone ke liye choda gaya, jiske baad panpane vaali stem koshika ke dohan ke liye use nasht kar diya gaya
 Because of the high therapeutic potential of human embryonic stem cells and the use of embryos discarded by in vitro fertilization clinics due to US moratorium as well as other concerns related to the use of human embryos for direct research
 Scientists are looking for other alternative paths

 During November 2006, British researchers at Newcastle University and King's College London filed a three-year license at the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority to mix human DNA with cow's ovum
 prastaav ke anusaar maanav diene ko aisi gaay ke dimb main daalaa jayega jisaki anuvanshik saamagree ko hataa diya gaya he or phir usee takanic se ek bhrun kaa nirmaan kiya jaae jisase doli bhed ko utpann kiya gaya tha
 This research was attempted several years ago in the United States but did not succeed in obtaining such a fetus
 april 2008 main newcastle vishvavidhyalay ke shodhakartaaon ne report di ki unka shodh safal rahaa
 The resulting embryos survived for 3 days and the largest one grew to a size of 32 cells
 Researchers are aiming at an embryo that lives for 6 days so that embryonic stem cells can be exploited
 2007 main, nevada vishvavidhyalay ke skool of medicine main vaigyanikon ne ek aisi bhed kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen 15% maanav koshikaayen or 85% bhed koshikaayen thim
 Chimeric mice are important tools in biological research, as they allow the investigation of various biological questions related to an animal within which two different genetic pools exist

mooshak bhrun, peripratyaropan or post pratyaropan, donon hi ek kymera ke liye yogadan kar sakate hai
 It is due to post transplant that ES cells from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of rodents, including the germ line
 ES koshikaayen kymera main bhi ek upyogi upkaran hai kyonki sadharmee punarsangyojan ke prayog ke madhyam se jin ko unamem parivartit kiya ja saktaa he, is prakaar jin lakshyikaran kii anumati milti he
 Since this discovery in 1999, ES cells have become an important tool in the production of specific chimeric mice
 mooshak kymera banane kii kshamta, aarambhik mooshak vikaas kii ek samaj se aati he
 In the phase between egg fertilization and transplanting a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the rodent embryo retain the ability to produce different cell lineages
 ek baar bhrun ke blastocyst charan main pahunchane par yah kai bhaagon se bana hua hota he, mukhya rup se trophectoderm, aantarik koshika dravyaman or aadim indoderm
 blastocyst ke ye prayek bhaag bhrun ke vibhinn bhaagon main vruddhi karte hai, aantarik koshika dravyaman khaas bhrun kaa vikaas karata he jabaki trophectoderm or aadim trophectoderm, un atirikt bhrun sanrachanaon ko utpann karte hai jo bhrun ke vikaas kaa samarthan karte hai
 Two to eight cell stage embryos are capable of forming chimeras, because cells in the embryo at these stages of development are not yet committed to giving rise to a particular cell lineage, they can produce internal cell mass or trophectoderm
 
 aise maamle main jahaan ek kymera ke nirmaan ke liye do diploid aath koshika charan bhrun kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he, kymerawaad ko baad main mooshak blastocyst ke epiblast, primitive, indoderm or trophectoderm main paaya ja saktaa he
 It is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so that a lineage of cells can be produced accordingly from a selected embryo, rather than the other
 udhaaharan ke liye blostomar ke subset kaa upyog ek bhrun se nirdisht koshika vansh vaale kymera ko utpann karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the internal cell mass of a diploid blastocyst can be used to form a chimera from other blastocysts of an eight-cell diploid embryo, cells derived from the internal cell mass will produce primitive endoderm and epiblast in the chimera rat
 Knowledge has led to the development of ES cell contribution to chimeras
 ES koshikaon ko, aath koshika or do koshika charan ke bhrun ke saath sangyojan main upyog kiya ja saktaa he taaki kymera banaaya ja sake or vishesh rup se bhrun ko utpann kiya ja sake
 Embryos used in chimeras can be further genetically altered to contribute exclusively to only a portion of the chimera
 ek udhaaharan he ES koshikaon or tetroploid bhrun se bana kymera, aise tetroploid jinhen do do-koshikeey diploid bhrun ke electrophyuzan dwaara kritrim rup se banaaya gaya he
 The tetraploid embryo will produce chromera, especially the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm
 aise kai vibhinn sangyojan hai jo ek safal kymera mooshak ko utpann kar sakate hai or prayog ke lakshya ke anusaar ek upyukt koshika or bhrun sangyojan ko chunaa ja saktaa he, ve aam taur par diploid bhrun or ES koshikaon, diploid bhrun or diploid bhrun, ES koshika or tetroploid bhrun, diploid bhrun or tetroploid bhrun, ES koshika or ES koshika main hote hai lekin itane tak simit nahin hote
bhruneey stem cell or diploid bhrun kaa sangyojan ek aam takanic he jise kymeric chuhon ko banane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, kyonki jin lakshyikaran ko bhruneey stem cell main kiya ja saktaa he
 These types of chimeras can be made either through aggregation of stem cells and diploid embryos or through injection of stem cells into diploid embryos
 ek kymera banane ke liye yadi bhrun stem koshikaon ko ek jin lakshyikaran ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he to nimna prakriya aam he, sanvardhit mooshak bhruneey stem koshikaon main lakshyit jin ke liye sadharmee punarsangyojan ke liye ek nirmaan ko electropolation ke jariye pesh kiya jaayegaa, punarsangyojan ghatana ke liye dhanatmak koshikaon main antibiotic pratirodh hoga, basharte ki jin lakshyikaran main prayukt sammilan casette dwaara ho or dhanatmak rup se chaynit hone ke liye sakasham hona chahie
 sahi lakshith jin ke saath ES koshikaayen phir ek diploid mejabaan mooshak blastocyst main antahkshipt kii jaati hai
 These injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo-pregnant female representative rodent, which will position the fetus and give rise to a rodent whose germ line is derived from the ES cells of the donor rodent
 a similar process can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, culturing diploid embryos into wells in aggregation plates where single embryos can fit, EC cells are added to these wells, aggregates
 Is cultured until a single embryo is formed and progresses to the blastocyst stage and is then reprogrammed
 Can be transferred to the user
 america or pashchimi europe main naitikta ke kade niyam or kaanoon hai jo maanav koshikaon ke upyog vaale kuch khaas prayogon kii spasht rup se manaahi karte hai
 Even between Europe and America, there is a vast difference in the regulatory framework
 
 may 2008 main, british house of comons main maanav stem koshikaon se kymera banane kii naitikta par ek zabardast bahes hui
 It was decided that permission to make embryos in laboratories will be given only on the condition that they are guaranteed to be destroyed within the first 14 days
 In the United States, too, there was an intense discussion on the issue of whether human stem cells should be allowed in the manufacture of chimeras

 yah bahut saral or sundar bhashaa main likhaa gaya he tathaa bich bich main kavitaayen bhi mili hui hai
 In it, the history of the Mongols of small weaker castes gathered together to form a central government, changed from a family oriented society to a Jagirdari society, and a small Jagirdar gathered to become a very strong country
 "geser khan kii katha" puranic katha par aadhaarit ek purush kii kahani he
 In this, the public fighting against the vassal and the priestly class has been praised
 "jangar" pashchimi mongolia main bani ek aitihaasik katha he
 In it, the emphasis is on the welfare and happiness of the public through the actions of a man
 aitihaasik granthon main itihaas kaa mani, sunaharaa itihaas bahut prasiddh hai
 Both are chronicles of Chingis Khan and his successors
 inamen pracheen mongol kii puranic kathaayen, lokthaayen aadi sankalit hai
 Modern literature has evolved from the people's revolution against the 1921 revolution and the Jagirdari system

 Generally people engage in such actions regularly, which is called economic action
 vyavsaay ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he : The business has the following characteristics: bharat kii saanskrithik dhrohar bahut samrudh he
 But perhaps few people would know that in ancient times India was a very developed country at the level of economy and business
 yah baat aitihaasik saakshyon, khudaai se praapt pramaanon, sahitya va likhit dastavezon se sidhi hoti hai
 Attracted by the immense wealth of India, most of these attacks from time to time by various foreign invaders also prove this fact

 It is proved from many historical evidences that at that time there were well planned cities in India
 bhartiya kapadon, aabhushanon or itra ityadi ke prati puure vishwa main aakarshan tha
 There has also been evidence that for a long time there was a trend among Indian traders to use currency for business
 vyapaariyon, shilpakaaron va utpaadakon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye sanghon ;hanpaskaddh kaa prachlan tha
 This indicates the complex development of trade and commerce in India

 Today, consumer-centric business techniques used in modern times have been an integral part of Indian business since ancient times
 isliye ham kah sakate hai ki bharat kii apni samrudhi vyavsaayik dhrohar he, jisane isaki unnati main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 All business actions are performed to serve certain purposes
 vyavsaay ke uddeshyon ko nimna prakaar vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he : The economic objectives of the business include all the necessary actions that serve the purpose of making profit, such as creating customers, regular innovation and better utilization of available resources, with the objective of making a profit
 laabh, vyavsaay ke liye jivan daayini shakti kaa kaary karata he
 Without this, no business can survive in the competition market

 is vishleshan, rajya aatankwaad ko videsh niti ke ek farm ke rup main pradarshit main upasthiti or samuhik vinaash ke astron kaa istemaal karke or aakaar kaa tha ki is rajya ke vyavhaar ke teji se badhate sweekaar kiye jate hai farm kaa netritv karne ke liye is tarah kii hinsak vyavhaar kii legitimizing

 State terrorism has also been used to describe peace time actions by government agents or forces, such as the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103
 The concept is also used to describe Is political repression by governments against their own civilian population to incite fear with this purpose
 For example, taking and executing civil hostages The extrajudicial eradication campaign is commonly considered "terror" or terrorism, for example during the Red Terror or the Great Terror
 Such actions are often also described as Demosidae which have been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism
 Empirical studies on democracy have found the younger Demosidae
 aatankwaad kaa ek rup he asamamit yuddh or adhik jab sidhe aam he paaramparik yuddh pranali yaa to yaa kaaran nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki neeche ke sangharsh ko hal karne ke liye istemaal nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political struggle
 This type of conflict varies widely; Historical examples include: aatankwaadi hamalon main aksar dar or prachaar ko adhiktam karne ke liye lakshith kar rahe hai
 They commonly use explosives or poisons, but there is also concern about using terrorist attacks weapons of mass destruction
 Militant organizations may usually methodically plan attacks in advance and train participants, plant "undercover" agents and Organized crime through supporters or raising money again
 Modern communication can be done through old fashioned methods, or Sector's courier, such as through kai raay aatankwaad ke kaarnon ke vishay main maujuud hai
 They range from demographic to socio-political reasons
 janankikeey karkon or bheed ucch vikaas dar shaamil ho sakate hai
 Social factors may include poverty, unemployment and land tenure problems
 rajnatik kaarak shaamil ho sakate hai dicenfranchisement, jaateey sangharsh, dharmik sangharsh, pradeshik sangharsh, sansaadhan, yaa bhi badla lene kaa upyog karne ke liye
 The desire to achieve its political goals and establish the power of one religion in the world has also been the main reason for the rise of terrorism
 kaarak he ki may ko yogadan aatankwaad karne ke liejisane diya In some cases, the rationale for a terrorist attack may be uncertain or unrelated to any large-scale social conflict
 ek vaishvik anusandhan report ek samaveshi duniya sabhi mahadwipon se shodhakartaaon kii ek antarrashtriya team ne taiyaar kii vartmaan din aatankwaad ke kaarnon kaa vishleshan kiya he
 It has reached the conclusion that acts of terrorism around the world like the 1st economic market
 There are demands for greed or grievances placed by terrorists
 Supply is driven by relative deprivation resulting in triple losses - growth deficit, democratic deficit and dignity deficit 
acts of terrorism take place at the point of intersection between supply and demand
 Those people put the use of demand to religion and If as the denominators for the supply of vehicles to establish relationships

 In 1918, when the upper two regions also came under the grip of civil war, the continuation of Sholokhov's studies ended untimely
 nirnay kii aitihaasik ghadi main shologov ne apana rasta chunane main koi hichak nahin dikhaayi
 At that time, the Bolsheviks were battling against the subversive actions of the remnants of anti-soviet white guards in the upper two regions and the rebellions of the Kajakas

 In his lecture given on the occasion of receiving the Nobel Prize, he also said that i have been following my duty as a writer and still believe that everything i have written so far and what i will write next, this labor i salute the people, the construction people and the brave people, the people who have never attacked anyone, but who have done their life, their freedom and respect , Has always been able to vigorously defend his right to build his future according to his will

 Lakhiram Agarwal was truly the guardian of the state BJP and also had a moral presence in Chhattisgarh
 unke paas jaakar kisi bhi str kaa kaaryakarta apni baat kah saktaa tha
 He was the head of the family who had the patience to listen and the courage to listen to everyone

 The memory of a hero like Lakiram Aggarwal inspires us and tells us how to maintain purity even while in business
 grihasth hokar bhi kis tarah se samaaj ke kaam puraa samay dekar kiye ja sakate hai
 Would you not consider it courageous to create arrogance in your region against Arjun Singh, the most powerful Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and not worry about the consequences? a powerful leader like Ajit Jogi stands in front of the Chief Minister and puts full force to establish his party's government
 aaj lakhiram agarwal kii yaad bahut swaabhaavik or maarmik lagati he
 The journey that Lakhiram Agarwal started from Kharsia, a small town in Chhattisgarh, took him to an important post like Madhya Pradesh BJP President

 Lakhiram Agarwal's parts are not major political successes, he could not win the assembly elections with Kharsia

 But he made this weakness his power

 Today the entire system of workers in the entire state is working under their inspiration
 ve kaaryakarta nirmaan kii prakriya ko samajhate the
 They were concerned about their construction and their administration
 sanghathan kii yah samaj hi unhen apane samakalinon ke bich unchai detii he
 If you see, Lakhiram Agarwal did not have anything on the basis of which he could start the journey of becoming important
 kharsia ek aisa ilaaka tha, jahaan bhaajapa kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 a small city where political importance is not enough
 iske saath hi lakhiram ji kisi vishay ke gambhir jaankaar yaa adhyeta bhi nahin the
 But he had a deep understanding of the organization
 apane nirantar pravaas or shram se unhone sari baadhaon ko paar kiya
 From Jashpur Kumar Sahib Dilip Singh Judeo, a doctor from Kawardha, Raman Singh to a young tribal leader from Tapkara to Nandkumar Sai, Rajesh Munat of today's generation was involved in taking and standing with them
 chhattisgarh ke har shahar or kshetra main unhone aise logon ko khadaa kiya jo aaj party kii kaman sanbhale hue hai
 He gave only better results without being critical of the criticisms

 The confidence that the BJP gained in the Chhattisgarh region even after losing that by-election is a history
 iske baad bhaajapa ne chhattisgarh main peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 The formation of Chhattisgarh state was a big dream of the residents of this region
 isamen dilli main bhaajapa kii sarkaar bananaa ek sukhad sanyog sabit hua
 It was also a coincidence that Lakhiram Agarwal had established a credibility as an organizer, not just as a member of the Rajya Sabha in Delhi
 unke prabhaav or kshamtaaon kaa puraa dal loha maanane laga tha
 His initiative on the formation of the state also had a special effect that the then Home Minister LK Advani agreed to form the state of Chhattisgarh
 iske saath hi chhattisgarh kaa apana bhugol praapt ho gaya
 Ajit Jogi became the first Chief Minister of the state based on the number of Congress mlas in the state
 unki kaaryastylee se bhaajapa kaa sanghathan hill gaya
 Jogi broke the back of the BJP by defecting to 12 BJP mlas

 The bjp's withdrawal in the midst of government terror was not ordinary
 kintu lakhiram agarwal, da
 raman singh, dilip singh judev, nandkumar saay, ramesh bas, baliram kashyap, brijmohan agarwal, virendra pandeya, banavaarilal agarwal, premaprakash pandeya jaise netaaon kii ekajutata or satat shram ne bhaajapa ko apni sarkaar banane kaa maarg prashast kar diya
 This victory was not an ordinary victory
 aise kathin samay main sanghathan main praan foonkane or use nayaa aatmavishvaas dene ke liye lakhiram agarwal or tatkaaleen sanghathan mantri saudaan singh ke yogadan ke bisaraaya nahin ja saktaa
 This was also the time when people were announcing the end of the BJP in the state and studying the Murcia of the BJP
 kintu samay ne karavat lee or bhaajapa ne da
 raman singh ke netritv main apni sarkaar banaayi
 Chief Minister Raman Singh said at a huge health camp held in Raigad that no poor will have to wander
 ummid he raman singh kii baat sahi sabit ho or jald hi aisa din aaye kii kisi garib ko ilaaj ke liye athwa apane kisi kareebi ke ilaaj ke liye kisi ko bhi bhatakana na pade kyonki mukhyamantri nivas main saptahik jandarshan kaarykram main kai log apane kisi kareebi ke behatar ilaaj ke liye sahaayta kii aas lekar pahuchate he jo baari bharkam kharch vahan karne kii sthiti main nahin hote vahi duusari taraf garib majaboor or pahuch vaale rashukhadaar ke madhya bade antar bataane vaali ek baat haal filhal hi hui jo maine padhi thi or shaayad sahi thi jab 108 par sahaayta ke liye baat hui to jawaab mila tha auto se le jaao vahi ek VIP ko rato raat behatar ilaaj ke hawaijwaj pahuch jaataa he
 There are many more examples that can be counted, but there is so much request that what you have said to the Chief Minister should be shown at the earliest so that a poor person does not get lost due to lack of proper treatment

 Even in this Samhita, the principles of the great importance of Ayurveda are disseminated here
 charak, sushrut, kaashyap aadi maanya granth ayurveda ko atharvaveda kaa upved maanate hai
 This proves the antiquity of Ayurveda
 atah ham kah sakate hai ki ayurveda kii rachanakaal isa purv 3,000 se 50,000 varsh pehle yani sristi kii utpatti ke aas-paas yaa saath kaa hi he
 Adi Acharya of this scripture is considered as Ashwini Kumar who added the head of a goat to the torso of Daksha Prajapati
 ashvini kumaron se indra ne yah vidya praapt kii
 Indra taught Dhanvantari
 kaashi ke raja divodas dhanvantari ke avatar kahe gaye hai
 Sushruta went to read Ayurveda by visiting her
 atri or bharadwaj bhi is shaastra ke pravartak maane jate hai
 The Acharyas of the Ayur Veda are - Ashvinikumar, Dhanvantari, Divodas, Nakula, Sahadeva, Arki, Chyavan, Janaka, Mercury, Javal, Jajali, Pal, Karath, August, Atri and his six disciples, Sushruta and Charak
 ayurveda ke aitihaasik gyaan ke sandarbh main sarvapratham gyaan kaa ullekh, charak mat ke anusaar mrityulok main ayurveda ke avataran ke saath- agnivesh kaa namollekh he
 First Prajapati from Brahma, Ashwini Kumar from Prajapati, Indra from him and Bhardwaj from Indra studied Ayurveda
 chyavan rishi kaa kaarykaal bhi ashvini kumaron kaa samakaleen mana gaya he
 Rishi Chyavan has an important contribution in the development of Ayurveda
 phir bharadwaj ne ayurveda ke prabhaav se deergh sukhi or aarogy jivan praapt kar anya rishiyon main uskaa prachaar kiya
 Subsequently Punarvasu Atreya preached Ayurveda to six disciples named Agnivesh, Bhel, Jatu, Parashar, Harit and Ksharpani
 in chah shishyon main sabase adhik budhimaan agnivesh ne sarvapratham ek samhita kaa nirmaan kiya- agnivesh tantra kaa jiskaa pratisanskaar baad main charak ne kiya or uskaa naam charakasamhita padaa, jo ayurveda kaa aadhaar stambh he
 According to Sushruta, Sasruta, along with other Maharishrias, came to Lord Dhanvantari, who appeared in the form of Kashiraj Divodas, and applied to him to study Ayurveda
 us samay bhagwaan dhanvantari ne un logon ko upadesh karte hue kaha ki sarvapratham swayan brahma ne sristi utpaadan purv hi atharvaveda ke upved ayurveda ko ek sahasr adhyay- shat sahasr shlokon main prakashit kiya or punah manushya ko alpamedhaavi samajhakar ise aath angon main vibhakt kar diya
 In this way, Dhanvantari has also considered the publication of Ayurveda as propounded by Brahmadev itself
 punah bhagwaan dhanvantari ne kaha ki brahma se daksh prajapati, unase ashvinikumar dway tathaa unase indra ne ayurveda kaa adhyayan kiya
 The history of Ayurveda is mainly divided into three parts - samhitakaal kaa samay 5veen shatee i
pus
 se 6veen shatee tak mana jaataa he

 is kaal main samhitakaal kii rachanaaon ke upar tikaakaron ne praudh or swasth vyakhyaayen nirupit kin
 The Sushruta Samhita vaccine of Acharya Dalhar of this time is considered very important in Ayurveda world
 shodh granth ‘rasratnasamucchy’ bhi isi kaal kii rachana he, jise acharya vagbhat ne charak or sushrut samhita or anek rasshastragyon kii rachana ko aadhaar banaakar likhaa he
 The time of this period is considered from the 14th century to the modern period

 The texts like Madhavnidan, Jawardarpan etc
 were also written in this period

 During this period, Ayurveda is being expanded and used on a very large scale
 spasht he ki ayurveda kii pracheenta vedon ke kaal se hi siddh he
 Social medicine is considered a new ideology in modern medicine, but it is not a new ideology but it is just a repetition of it, which has been mentioned in Ayurveda even before 2500 years

 And similarly, it is also mentioned in the Rigveda that 'bhishktamth and bhrishajan srinomi'

 Therefore, Vedas are an important indicator and source for Ayurveda

 ayurveda kii drushti se atharvaveda kaa sthaan atyant mahatvapurn he
 In this, a detailed description of almost all the organs and appendages of Ayurveda is found

 ayurveda ko arthved main 'bheshaj' yaa 'bhishagved' naam se janaa jaataa he
 The mantras of the Atharvaveda are also related to Ayurveda in the Gopatha Brahmin
 shatapath brahman main yajurveda ke ek mantra kii vyakhya main praan ko 'atharva' kaha gaya he
 This means that pranavidya or life science is anthropology

 The description of the juices of the organs i
e
 the elements in which it is obtained is called Angiras

 spasht he ki vedon main ayurveda se sambandhit saikadon mantron kaa varnan he, jisamen vibhinn rogon kii chikitsa kaa ullekh he
 Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda - Among these four Vedas, Atharvaveda is considered the soul of Ayurveda
 atharvaveda main swastyayan mangalkarm, upwas, balidaan, home, niyam, praayshchit or mantra aadi se bhi chikitsa karne ko kaha gaya he
 The Atharvaveda mentions the highest number of 289 medicines
 is prakaar gyaat hota he ki ayurvishyayak aushadhiyon kaa vistrut vivaran atharvaveda main hi paaya jaataa he
 Among the original texts of Ayurveda, Kashyapa Samhita, Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, Bhelsamhita and Bharadwaja Samhita, Kashyapa Samhita is considered to be very ancient
