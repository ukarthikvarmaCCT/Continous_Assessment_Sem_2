 Dead language or extinct language is called that which no one speaking can live
 chaahe us bhashaa kaa kisi anya bhashaa bolne waalon dwaara anya prakaar se upyog bhi kyon na ho rahaa ho
 Such languages have no mother tongue
 kisi bhashaa ke mrit yaa vilupt hone kaa kaaran, unke bolne waalon dwaara kisi anya bhashaa ko sweekaar karnaa yaa un sabhi kii mrityu ho janaa hi hota he
 Generally, if that language is directly replaced by another language, then it is also possible to translate that language into other languages
 jaise america main bane kai bhashaaon par angreji, francisi, portugali aadi ke upniveshon ne vahaan kii bhashaa ko apane bhashaa ke saath badal diya
 Such a change can translate but the language cannot be revived in the same way, because many sentences and words disappear forever with the same
 jiske bhi koi bolne vaale yaa likhane vaale log na ho use vilupt bhashaa maan liya jaataa he
 Such languages are also called dead languages
 kai kamjor bhashaaon ke liye aarthik va saanskrithik vaishvikaran or vikaas ke kaaran khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 In order to communicate easily in the world market, people leave their mother tongue and try to learn languages like English, Chinese, Spanish and French
 iske kaaran iskaa prabhaav unke maatrubhaasha par padataa he
 American linguists Sarah Gray Thomson and Terence Kauffman studied language change in 1991, stating that there are three main reasons for language extinction
 pehla or aam kaaran, kisi bhashaa ke bolne waalon dwaara achaanak apane bhashaa ko chhod kar duusare pramukh bhashaa ko siikhnaa
 The second reason is the gradual death of language by many generations
 teesraa or sabase durlabh kaaran, kisi bhashaa ke vyakaran or shabd lagbhag yaa puri tarah se badal jaayen, arthath kisi pramukh bhashaa se vyakaran or shabdon ko atyaadhik udhaar lene ke saath saath us bhashaa ke kai maatrubhaashi us bhashaa ko anaavashyak shabdon or vyakaran ke niyamon ke udhaar lene se bachaane kaa prayaas karte hai
 For this reason, those who speak that language start speaking that major language and leave their mother tongue
 shiksha pranali or media jaise internet, televijan or print media aadi bhi bhashaa ko vilupt karne main sahaayak hote hai
 For example, if a person goes from one country to another, then his children study in the language in which the educational institutions of that country are studied
 aise main ve apni maatrubhaasha se dur ho jate hai
 Many languages made in America have become dead or extinct due to colonies of English, French, Portuguese etc

 sambandhit janaganana code: Quibble is a word formed from the treaty of two words 'curve' and 'utterance'
 iskaa shabdic arth he- aisi ukti jo saamaanya se alag ho
 Tereda statement means that the word has power
 bhamah ne vakrokti ko ek alankaar mana tha
 His later Kuntaka developed curvature as a complete theory and incorporated all the parts of poetry into it
 isliye kuntak ko vakrokti sampradaay kaa pravartak acharya mana jaataa he
 Kuntaka is credited with the prestige and rendering of the Vibhokti theory, but its tradition is ancient
 bhamah ke purvavarti kaviyon baan, subandhu aadi main iske sandarbh praapt hote hai
 Bhamah has used curvature in a broader sense
 unhone vakrokti main shabd or arth, donon kaa antarbhaav mana he
 They have used quibble and exaggeration in the same sense
 atishyokti kaa arth he lokatikrant gocharata
 Vibhokti is considered as the original decking for the same reason
 iske bina vaakya kavy na rahakar vaarta maatr rah jaataa he
 Dandi has also given importance to Vakrokti as Bhamah
 dandi ne waniumay ke do bhed bataaye hai- swaabhaavokti tathaa vakrokti
 Dandi has accepted curvature and exaggeration at the root of all ornaments
 bhamah or dandi main keval yah antar he ki bhamah sbhavokti ko vakrokti kii paridhi main sweekaar karte hai or dandi use bhinn maanate hue vakr kathan se kam mahatvapurn samajhate hai
 Anandavardhana has not given an independent interpretation of quibble
 unhone ise vishisht alankaar maanakar iske saamaanya tathaa vyapak rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 Anandavardhana, while acknowledging the curvilinear significance of Bhamah, considered the exaggeration and quibble synonymous and accepted all the embellishments as exaggerated
 abhinavgupt ne vakrokti ke saamaanya rup ko sweekaar kiya he
 According to them, the curvature of words and meanings is their extraterrestrial position and the meaning of this extraterrestrial is excessive
 vakrokti siddhant ke pravartak kuntak ne apane granth vakrokti jivitam main vakrokti ko kavy kii aatma kaha he
 He has given proper place to all poetry - Varna miracle, word beauty, elegance of content, unpredictability, management imagination etc
 by adhering to all poetic principles under curvature
 kuntak ke anusaar vakrokti keval vaak-chaaturya athwa ukti chamatkaar nahin he, vah kavi vyapaar athwa kavi kaushal he
 According to Dr
 Nagendra "in modern terms, it can be called artism - the most important element of poetry is art
" iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kuntak ne apane siddhant main vishay-vastu kaa nishedh kiya he
 He has accepted the natural elegance of the poetic object
 kavi ko kavy vastu ke sahruday-romantic dharmon ko vyakt karnaa chahie
 This is possible only with the talent of the poet
 is prakaar unke anusaar antat kavi vyapaar hi pramukh he
 " bhartiya kavy siddhant main ras siddhant anubhuti athwa bhaavana par aadhaarit he or alankaar siddhant kavi kalpana par aadhaarit he
 The quibble theory is related to the decking principle in this respect
 vakrokti main alankaaron ke kalpana vaichitrya ko vyapak aadhaar par sweekaar kiya gaya he
 This imagination is unique, not congenial
 dhwani tathaa vakrokti kaa antar bhi yahi he ki dhwani kii kalpana sahrudayanishth he or vakrokti kii kalpana kavyanishth
 Therefore, the approach of sound is subjective and objective of curvature
 kuntak ne ras ko vakrokti kaa praan maanakar kalpana ke saath bhaavana ke mahatv ko bhi sweekaar kiya he
 Kuntaka has also considered angular curvature as a part of curvature
 vakrata ke bina ras kii sthiti sambhav nahin he jabaki ras ke bina vakrata kii apni swatantra sthiti he
 Kuntaka considers desperation curvature to be contemptible, not giving importance to such a situation
 kuntak kaa vakrokti siddhant vyapak or samanvayshil siddhant he
 At the core of its origin is sound theory with a tradition of ornamentation theory
 kuntak ke vakrokti siddhant main sampurna kavy ko sweekruti mili he
 Even if the force in his theory is on the art side, his explanation has the full support of the object side and the emotional side

 prithviraj raso hindi bhashaa main likhaa ek mahakavy he jisamen prithviraj chouhan ke jivan or charitra kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Its author Rao Chand Bardai Bhatt who was from the Kaladi Gautra of Chandisa Rao and was a childhood friend and prince of Prithviraj and also encouraged the army with poems of Veer Ras during his war travels
 1165 se 1192 ke bich jab prithviraj chouhan kaa rajya ajmer se dilli tak failaa hua tha
 Prithvirajasso is a huge treatise of two and a half thousand pages which has 69 times
 pracheen samay main prachlit praayah sabhi chhandon kaa isamen vyavhaar hua he
 The main verses are Kavitta, Duha, Tomar, Trotak, Gaha and Arya
 jaise kadambari ke sambandh main prasiddh he ki uskaa pichhlaa bhaag baan bhatta ke putr ne puraa kiya he, vaise hi raso ke pichley bhaag kaa bhi chand ke putr jalhan dwaara purna kiya gaya he
 According to Raso, when Shahabuddin Ghori imprisoned Prithviraj and took him to Ghazni, then Chand went there a few days later
 jate samay kavi ne apane putr jalhan ke haath main raso kii pustak dekar use purna karne kaa sanket kiya
 The handing over of Rasohan to Raso and its completion is mentioned in Raso - raso main die hue sanwaton kaa aitihaasik tathyon ke saath anek sthanon par mail na khaane ke kaaran anek vidwaanon ne prithvirajraso ke samasamyik kisi kavi kii rachana hone main andeh karte he or use 16veen shatabdi main likhaa hua granth tehraate hai
 The oldest copy of this composition is found in the official library of Bikaner, there is a total of 3 copies
 rachana ke ant me prithviraj dwaara shabd bhedi baan chalaa kar gauri ko maarane kii baat bhi kii gayi he
 Prithvirajasso is a poet of the Rasak tradition
 jaisaa iske naam se hi prakat he, dilli ke antim hindu samrat prithviraj ke jivan kii ghatnaon ko lekar likhaa gaya hindi kaa ek granth jo raav chandvardaai bhatta kaa likhaa mana jaataa rahaa he
 Earlier, Hindi was familiar to only one form of this poem, which incidentally was the most elaborate form of composition, it contained about eleven thousand metaphors
 uske baad rachana kaa ek usase chota rup kuch pratiyon main mila, jisamen lagbhag saadhe teen hajaar roopak the
 After that, a form was obtained in few copies, in which the total metaphor did not exceed twelve hundred
 tadnantar do pratiyaan uski aisi bhi praapt hui jinamein kramash: chaar sau or saadhe paanch sau roopak hi the
 All these copies presented various complete forms of composition
 rachana ke kuch khandon kii pratiyaan bhi praapt hui hai, jinka sambandh uparyukt pratham do roopon se rahaa he
 Thus, naturally a dispute arose as to how the various complete forms mentioned above developed
 kuch vidwaanon ne isse sarvatha bhinn mat prakat kiya
 He said that the biggest form must have been the original form of the composition and from that only progressively smaller forms would have been presented as abbreviations
 inhone iskaa pramaan yah diya ki rachana kaa koi rup, yahan tak ki sabase chota rup bhi, anaitihaasikta se mukt nahin he
 But this dispute was then abandoned here and no attempt was made to resolve it for a long time
 iskaa pratham ullekhneey prayaas 1955 main hua
 When a scholar wrote the article titled The Relation of the Three Texts of Prithviraj Raso, it showed that the numbers that represent the forces of Prithviraj and his opposition are found in three different texts of composition: the largest, the smaller and the smaller
 And if looked at as a whole, the quantity of exaggeration in relation to these numbers is also reduced progressively in the above mentioned sequence
 yadi ye paath brihatmadhyamalaghulaghutam kram main viksit hue hote, to sankshep kriya ke kaaran balaabal suchak sankhyaon main koi antar na miltaa
 Therefore it is evident that the sequence of development of the obtained forms is the shortest
 prabandh kii drushti se yadi ham rachana kii uktishrinkhalaaon or chandashrankhalaon tathaa prasangashrinkhalaaon par dhyaan den to vahaan bhi dekhenge ki ye shrinkhalaayen laghutmalaghumadhyambrihat kram main hi uttarottar adhikadhik tuuti hai or bich bich main isi kram se adhikadhik chand or prasang prakshepakartaataon ke dwaara rakhe gaye hai
 But even the smallest form of composition is not completely free from these series of errors, so it is clearly known that the original form of 'raso' must have been smaller than the shortest form
 'prithvirajraso' kii katha sankshep main is prakaar he : prithviraj jis samay dilli ke singhaasana par tha, kannauj ke raja jayachand ne rajasuya yajna karne kaa nishchay kiya or isi avasar par usne apni kanya sanyogita kaa swayamvar bhi karne kaa sankalp kiya
 He sent the invitation of Rajsuya to far-flung kings and invited Prithviraj to join him
 prithviraj or uske saamanton ko yah baat khali ki bahuvachanon ke hote hue bhi koi anya rajasuya yajna kare or prithviraj ne jayachand kaa nimantran asweekaar kar diya
 Even then Jaichand determined to perform the Rajasuya Yajna and installed a statue of Prithviraj as the gatekeeper at the door of the Yagyamandap
 prithviraj swabhaavat: is ghatana se apmaan samajhakar kshubdh hua
 Meanwhile, she also got the news that Jaichand's daughter Sanyogita has resolved to disguise Prithviraj as a husband, ignoring the father's words, and Jaichand is enraged at this and has sent her to a different Gangsattar residence
 in samaacharon se santapt hokar vah rajdhani ke baahar akhet main apana samay kisi prakaar bitaa rahaa tha ki uski anupasthiti se laabh uthaakar uske mantri kaivas ne uski ek karnaati daasi se anuchit sambandh kar liya or ek din raat ko uske kaksh main pravisht ho gaya
 When Pattaragini came to know about this, he immediately called Prithviraj and Prithviraj came to the Raj Bhavan in two clocks at night
 jab use ukt daasi ke kaksh main kaivas ko dikhaaya gaya, usne raatri ke andhkaar main hi unhen lakshya karke baan chode
 The first arrow missed but as soon as the second arrow started, the canvas collapsed
 rato raat donon ko ek gadde main gadwakar prithviraj akhet par chalaa gaya, phir duusare din rajdhani ko lautaa
 When the woman from Kaivas prayed to Chand to get her dead husband's body, Chand requested Prithviraj
 prithviraj ne chand kaa yah anurodh is shart par sweekaar kiya ki vah use apane saath le jaakar kannauj dikhayega
 Both friends hugged and cried
 prithviraj ne kaha ki is apmaanpurn jivan se maran acha tha or uske kavimitra ne uski is bhaavana kaa anumodan kiya
 His widow became Sati by taking the dead body of Canvas
 chand ke saath thawitt ke shesh main prithviraj ne kannauj ke liye prayaag kiya
 He also took hundred brave Rajput feudal soldiers together
 kannauj pahunchakar jayachand ke darbar main gaya
 Jaichand welcomed him a lot and asked him about Prithviraj's age, form etc
 chand ne uskaa jaisaa kuch vivaran diya, vah uske anuchar thawitt main dekhakar jayachand kuch sashankit hua
 He called a maid along with other maids, who had previously served Prithviraj, on the pretext of offering a drink to the poet
 usne prithviraj ko thwitt ke vesh main dekhakar sir dhank liya
 But someone said that Chand was an integral part of Prithviraj, so the maid covered her head on seeing it and the matter ended there itself
 kintu duusare din praat: kaal jab jayachand chand ke dere par usase milane gaya, thawitt ko singhaasana par baitha dekhakar use pun: shankaa hui
 Chand tried to alleviate his doubts by making excuses and asked Thawitt to offer him a drink
 paan dete hue thawitt veshi prithviraj ne jo vakr drushti phenki, usase jayachand ko bhalee bhanti nishchay ho gaya ki yah swayan prithviraj he or usne prithviraj kaa saamana datakar karne kaa aadesh nikaala
 Here Prithviraj went out to revolve around the city
 jab vah ganga main machhliyon ko moti chuga rahaa tha, sanyogita ne ek daasi ko usko thik thik pahchaanane tathaa uske prithviraj hone par apana premanivedan karne ke liye bheja
 When the maid decided that she was Prithviraj, she pleaded for coincidence
 prithviraj tadnantar sanyogita se mila or donon kaa us gangatatavarti awaas main panigrahan hua
 At that time he left from there, but at the behest of his feudal lords, he again came to know and brought with him coincidence
 jab usne is prakaa sanyogita kaa apharan kiya, chand ne lalkaakar jayachand se kaha ki uskaa shatru prithviraj uski kanya kaa varan kar ab usase daayaj ke rup main yuddh maang rahaa tha
 As a result, conflict started on both sides
 do dinon ke yuddh main jab prithviraj ke anek yoddha maare gaye, saamanton ne use yuddh kii vidha badalane kii salaah di
 He suggested that he proceed towards Delhi with Sanyogita and that he should prevent Jaichand's army from proceeding in the path of Delhi till he reached Delhi with Sanyogita
 prithviraj ne is sweekaar kar liya or anek saamanton tathaa shur veeron yauddhaon kii bali ne ananthar sanyogita ko lekar dilli gaya
 Jaichand returned to Kannauj with his army
 dilli pahunchakar prithviraj sanyogita ke saath, vilasamagn ho gaya
 He did not get out of the house for six months, which resulted in resentment in his Guru, Bandhav, Bhatia and Lok
 praja ne raajaguru se ksht kaa nivedan kiya to raajaguru chand ko lekar sanyogita ke awaas par gaya
 Together, they sent Prithviraj a magazine listing of Ghori's attack and sent it to the messenger maid: 'gori rattatuadhara tu gori anurat
 ' raja kii vilasanidra bhang hui or vah sanyogita se vidaa hokar yuddh ke liye nikal padaa
 Shahabuddin had brought a huge army this time
 prithviraj ke anek shur yoddha or samant kannoj yuddh main hi maare ja chuke the
 As a result, Prithviraj's army returned from the battlefield and Shahabuddin emerged victorious
 prithviraj bandi kiya gaya or gazani le jaaya gaya
 After a few days there Shahabuddin got his eyes removed
 jab chand prithviraj ke kashton kaa samachar mila, vah gazani apane mitra tathaa swami ke uddhaar ke liye avadhoot ke vesh main chal padaa
 He met Shahabuddin
 vahaan jane kaa kaaran poochne par usne bataaya ki ab vah badarikashram jaakar tap karnaa chahta tha kintu ek saadh uske ji main shesh thi, isaliye vah abhi vahaan nahin gaya tha
 He took birth with Prithviraj and they played together in childhood
 usee samay prithviraj ne usase kaha tha ki vah singini ke dwaara bina fal ke baadh se hi saat ghadiyaalon ko ek saath bedh saktaa tha
 He could not see this skill of his, and now seeing that he wanted to complete his practice
 gori ne kaha ki vah to andhaa kiya ja chukaa he
 Chand said that he could still show the same skill, he believed it
 shahabuddin ne uski yah maang sweekaar kar lee or tatsambandhi sara aayojan karaayaa
 Disappointed with life on Chand's encouragement, Prithviraj also accepted his request to kill the enemy on the pretext of showing his confederation skills
 prithviraj se sweekruti lekar chand shahabuddin ke paas gaya or kaha ki vah lakshyavedh tabhi karne ko taiyaar hua he jab vah swayan apane mukh se use teen baar lakshavedh karne kaa ahvaahan kare
 Shahabuddin accepted it as well
 1 Shah gave two orders, then the third one gave as soon as he was hit by Prithviraj's arrow and he was dashed
 prithviraj kaa bhi ant hua
 The gods inflicted wreaths on him and the earth exulted after getting a descent from Mlechha Ghori
 yahan par 'prithvirajraso' kii katha samaapt hoti he
 There has been a huge controversy over the historicity of 'raso', especially since the famous scholar and archaeologist Vuilar got a fragmented copy of Sanskrit poetry called 'prithviraj Vijay'
 yah vivaad uske brihat paath ko lekar chalaa he, kintu rachana kaa laghutam paath tak aisa nahin he jo anaitihaasikta se sarvatha mukt ho
 For example, Jaichand mentions that Karna of Dahl was defeated and imprisoned twice, but he was about one hundred hundred years before Jaichand
 jayachand se hue kahe gaye prithviraj ke yuddh ke sambandh main koi nishchit aitihasika samarthan abhi tak nahin praapt ho sakaa he
 Prithviraj was the ruler of Ajmer; The ruler of Delhi was a Govindarai or Khanderai who fought both the wars on behalf of Prithviraj and was killed in another war
 musalmaan itihaaskaaron ke anusaar gori se prithviraj ke keval do yuddh hue the, 'raso' ke anusaar kam se kam chaar yutra hue the3⁄4 jinamein se teen main shahabuddin parajeet hua tha or bandi kiya gaya tha
 According to Muslim historians, Prithviraj was captured and killed near Saraswati, after being defeated, while according to 'raso' he died by killing Shahabuddin in Ghazni as mentioned above
 ye anaitihaasik ullekh or vivaran 'prithvirajraso' ke samast roopon main paae jate hai or inamen se adhikartar uske taane bane ke hai, isaliye uske kisi bhi punarnimit rup main bhi paae jaanenge
 Therefore one has to believe that none of his forms can be a contemporary creation of Prithviraj
 prashn yah he ki 'raso' kis samay kii rachana maani ja saktaa he
 Some time later, the famous investigative scholar Muni Jinvijay found a copy of two 'jain Prabandha' collections in Jain Bhandars, comprising 'prithviraj Prabandha' and 'jaichand Prabandha'
 in prabandhon main jo chand uddhrut the unamem se kuch 'prithviraj raso' main bhi mili, yadhyapi in uddharanon kii bhashaa main 'raso' kii bhashaa kii apeksha pracheenta adhik surakshit thi
 In both the copies, 'prithviraj' management was often integral and one of the arrangements was copy no
 It was 1528
 inase munijee ne yah parinaam nikaala ki chand avashya hi prithviraj kaa samakaleen or uskaa raajakavi tha
 But this result will not be a logical conclusion
 in tathyon ke aadhaar par ham itnaa hi kah sakate hen ki chand ko rachana kaa koi na koi rup sanwat 1528 ke pehle praapt tha, jisase lekar ve chand ukt 'prithvirajprabandh' main uddhrut kiye gaye
 That form no
 In relation to how much pre-1528 would have been built, it can be said from some estimates, for which the following grounds can be taken: uddhrut chhandon main se ek 'raso' ke laghutam paath kii pratiyon main nahin miltaa he usamen kainvas ko 'vyas' or vashishtha kaha gaya he, jabaki 'raso' ke samast roopon main uske karnati daasi ke saath anuchit prem kii katha di gai he, jisase prakat he ki yah chand mul rachayita uparyukt aadharbhoot prabandhlekhak ko praapt thi, vah prakshipt tha; rachana kaa mul rup uske bhi purv kaa hona chahie
 If the above projected form of the composition is to be about 50 years after its original form, the original ancestral collections would have been prepared about 25 years after that and the copies received were about twenty five years after the preparation of both the above collections
 If it is original poetry no
 Around 1400 can be considered
 samay ke is anumaan main kahin par udaartaa nahin barti gai he, isaliye mul rachana kii tithi iske bahut baad nahin tal sakati he
 The form of the language of composition is found in the examples of arrangements and in the copies of the shortest forms of composition, it is also no
 Around 1400 is known, so the evidence of language also confirms the above result
 'prithvirajraso' vir ras kaa hindi kaa sarvshereshth kavy he
 a vivid imagination of heroic characters in Hindi literature was never seen later in this poem
 pathak rachana bhar main utsaah kii ek umadti hui sarita main bahata chalata he
 The pictures of Anurag and Viraha of Sanyogita before the Kannauj war and the union of Prithviraj Sankhyarita of the said war and the paintings of Kelli Vilas are very attractive
 anya rason kaa bhi kavy main abhaav nahin he
 The description of the composition is extraordinary; The narrator's description of the heroine's mating time provides beautiful examples of synthetic nature painting somewhere
 bhashastyli sarvatra prabhaavapurn he or varnya vishay ke anuroop kavy bhar main badalati rahati he
 If we look at all these qualities of the composition, then it is a beautiful epic and it is undoubtedly a typical work of the modern era of modern Indian Aryabha literature
 mohanlal vishnulaal pandya or shyamsundar das ke sampadan main nagari prachaarini sabha ne do khandon main prithviraj raso kaa prakaashan kiya

 This composition is perfectly symmetrical on each side of the building, which makes this building an octagon rather than a square, but with the four sides of the corner being much smaller than the other four sides, it would be appropriate to call it square

 ODI first match: against Pakistan, at Gaba, Brisbane, 1999-00 saanchaa:300 ODI wickets club a vacuum cleaner, also known as a hoover or sweeper, and is commonly called a vacuum cleaner, is a device that typically creates a partial vacuum to pull dust and dirt off the floor and to the air pump Is used
 baad main niptaan ke liye gandagi ko yaa to dustbag dwaara ikattha kiya jaataa he yaa chakravaat dwaara
 In 1860, Daniel Hayes of Iowa, West Union, United States, invented a vacuum cleaner
 ise unhone vacum sweepar kehane ke bajaae karpet clinar kaha, darasal, unki mashin main ek ghoomanevaala brush tha jaisaa ki paaramparik vacum clinar main hota he, dhul or gandagi ko khinchne ke liye iske yantra ke upree sire par badi-si dhaunkani lagi he
 On June 10, 1860, Hess received a paint for his invented vacuum cleaner
 haathon se chalaaye janevaale pehle clinar main "bavandar" ke siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tha, jiskaa avishkaar 1868 main uese ke chicago ke eves dablyoo
 mcgaphe ne kiya tha
 The whirlwind machine was light and small in size, but difficult to operate, as it had to be rotated as well as used to run across the floor with one hand
 8 june 1869 ko mcgaphe ne is upkaran ke liye patent hasil kiya or saarvajanik taur par beche jane ke liye boston ke da american karpet clining company kii madad se ise soochibaddh kiya
 It was sold for $ 25
 yah tay karnaa kathin he ki bavandar kitna safal rahaa, kyonki inamen se zyaadaatar chicago or boston main bika or samajha jaataa he ki 1871 main inamen se adhikansh great chicago fire main nasht ho gaye
 Only two are known to have survived, one of whom can be seen at the Hoover Historical Center
 19veen shatabdi main sanyukt rajya america or europe main jitne avishkaarak hue mcgaphe unamem se ek the, jinhone manual vacum clinar kaa avishkaar kiya
 It was first patented as an electrically operated "carpet sweeper and dust gatherer" and approved in December 1900 by Corinne Dufour of Savannah, Georgia
 1876 main, uese main michigan ke grand repids ke melville bicel ne kaaleen se lakdi ke buraade ko saaf karne ke liye apni patni ana ke liye ek vacum clinar banaaya
 Soon after, the Bissell carpet sweeper arrived
 1889 main melvil kii achaanak mrityu ke baad en ne company kaa niyantran sambhala or ve duniya kii bahut hi taqatvar kaarobaari mahilaon main se ek ban gayi
 The invention of the first motorized vacuum cleaner in 1901 is usually credited to Hubert Cecil Booth, although two years earlier in 1899, John Therman of St
 Louis, Missouri, America, actually invented the motorized vacuum cleaner
 booth ne trainon main kursiyon kii dhul udaane vaale ek upkaran ke pradarshan ko dekha or sochaa ki dhul ko khinch lene ke liye yah kahin adhik upyogi hoga
 He tested it by putting a handkerchief on a restaurant chair, put his mouth in the handkerchief and then tried to draw as much dust as possible
 roomaal ke neeche kii ore dhul or gandagi jamaa dekh unhone samaj liya ki unka vichaar kaam kar saktaa he
 Booth created a large device called Puffing Billy; First an oil engineer and later an electric motor driven
 It was pulled by horses and parked outside the building to be cleaned
 booth ne british vacum clinar company shuru kii or agle kai dashakon main apane avishkaar ko parishkrut kiya
 Although his "goblin" model lost in competition to the domestic vacuum market with Hoover, his company successfully shifted its focus to the industrial market and created much larger models for factories and warehouses
 neumatic tub system mekar kwairpes li
 kii ek ikai ke rup main aaj booth kii company chal rahi he
 In 1910, P
A
 Fisker patented a vacuum cleaner in the name of his company's telegram address — Nifisk
 It was the first electric vacuum cleaner in Europe
 ise mahaj 17
5 kilogram vajan kii dizin main banaaya gaya, jise ek vyakti dwaara bhi sanchalit kiya ja saktaa tha
 The Fisker & Nielsen Company was formed a few years ago
 in dinon nifisk vacum kaa vitaran nilphisk-advance dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In 1905 "griffith's Advanced Vacuum Equipment for Carpet Dust Removal" was another manually operated cleaner patented by Walter Griffith Manufacturer, Birmingham, England
 yah portable tha, ise rakhana aasaan tha or ise "kisi bhi vyakti " dwaara chalaaya ja saktaa tha
 a blower-like device installed in it was used to pressurize it
 isamen lage ek nikaal liye jane yogya ek lacheele pipe ke jariye dhul ko nikaala jaataa tha, jisamen vibhinn aakaar kii tonti lagaayi ja sakati thi
 This was arguably the first home vacuum cleaner device, which was very similar to modern vacuum cleaners
 america vacum clinar udyog kii sthapana ke liye 1903 or 1913 ke bich uese avishkaarak david tii
 kennedy ko nau patent diya gaya
 Membership of the Vacuum Cleaner Manufacturers Association, formed in 1919, was limited only to those licensed under their patents
 1907 main, uese ke ohio, cantone main ek chaukeedaar james murre spangler ne pehla vyaavhaarik portable vacum clinar kaa avishkaar kiya
 Significantly, the electric fan, a box, and the suction used in the shell of his wife's pillow were attached to a revolving brush to empty the Spangler-designed garbage
 dhan kii kami ke kaaran us dizin kaa utpaadan karne main ve asamarth the to unhone 1908 main wiliam henary hover ko ise bech diya, jinhone spangler kii mashin ko ispaat ke aavaran, dhalaai or sanlagnakon ke saath phir se ise dizin kiya
 Later innovations include the first disposable filter bags of the 1920s and the first upright vacuum cleaner of 1926
 2 june 1908 ko spangler ne apane ghoomanevaale brush kaa paintent karaayaa or antat: is idia ko apni bhatiji ke pati hover ko bech diya
 He was in the process of selling a new product, as his 'hoover Harness and Leather Goods' company was on the verge of extinction due to an invention in the automobile sector
 sanyukt rajya america main, vacum clinar samet gharelu saamaanon ke agrani nirmaataaon main ek rahaa he hover; or is avishkaar ke kaaran hover bahut hi amir ban gaye the
 In fact, in Britain, Hoover's name became so synonymous with vacuum cleaners that "everyone's carpets become Hoover's"
 shuruuaat main yah 'da electric sacshan sweepar company' kahalaaya, unka pehla vacum o model 1908 main aayaa, jise 60 dollar main bechaa gaya
 Hoover is also notable for a unique vacuum cleaner, the Constellation Hoover is a canister vacuum cleaner, but does not have a wheel
 iske bajaay, vacum clinar apane nikasi par pravaahman hota he or hovercraft kii tarah prachaalit hota he, haalanki puraane model main aisa nahin he
 It consisted of a rotating tube at the top end with the intention that the user would operate by placing the unit in the center of the room and working around the cleaner
 1952 main laayaa gaya canstar vacum clinar sangrahntiya he or golakaar akruti ke kaaran aasaani se pahachaane jate hai
 They were very noisy, had low cleaning capacity and could not move over the carpet
 lekin ye ek dilachasp mashin ban kar rah gaye; inase kaam liya jaataa, sakht lakdi ke farshawale gharon main acchhee tarah kaam karte hai
 Constructions were changed and updated in the last few years before being discontinued in 1975
 vacum ke antargat in sabhi nikaasiyon ke constlation maarg bhinn airfoil kaa upyog karte hai
 The updated designs closely resemble modern standards, as they suppress the sounds on the carpet, in particular
 ye modelon kaaleen par yaa nange farsh par - balki sakht farsh par tairte hue chalate he, isse nishkasit vaayu kisi bhi tarah ke sataha par yaa kachare ke aasapaas bikhar jaati hai
 Now Hoover has been re-released in the US in later Constellation Model models with an updated version
 ek hepa filtereshan bag, jo ki ek 12 ampear kaa motor, ek sacshan terbine jo bijli se brush ko farsh par ghumaata he, badlaav ko shaamil kiya gaya or iske hathe ko phir se dizin kiya gaya, jo tut jane vaala tha
 The same model was marketed in the UK under the Metag brand as the satellite, as its license was restricted
 yues kii puraani ikai main sacshan yogya 5
2 ampear motor daalaa gaya, lekin in sabhi main motorchalit brush nahin tha
 So they usually work better on hard floors or on small carpets
 puraani ikaiyaan hover kii tarah ke je paper bag hote hai, lekin ye chote kism ke es alerjan filtereshan bag ko puraane vacum ke khaane main aasaani se kaat-chhaant kar feet kiya ja saktaa he
 Replacement motors from US Hoover are still available for some models
 1973 main celebrati naam se hover ne hawa main chakkar lagane vaala vacum clinar kaa ek or model taiyaar kiya
 Its flat shape is like a "flying saucer"
 paaramparik canstar model ko kuch der chalane ke baad hawa main chakkar lagaanevaale vacum kii tarah banane ke liye hover main pahie jode gaye hai
 It uses H-type bags
 shuruuaati vacum clinar baari khadi rahanevaali ikaiyaan hua karti thi or aasaani se kahin nahin le janaa ja saktaa tha
 But in 1921 Electrolux brought the Model V, which was designed to be powered by two thin metals
 is navachaar kii kalpana electrolux ke sansthaapak eksal vener-grain dwaara kii gayi thi, bhavi peedi ke vacum clinar ke liye yah ek maanak visheshta ban gayi
 Electrolux vacuum cleaners of the 1930s held the record for 70 years and eventually broke in 2008
 iske aane ke baad bahut saalon ke baad tak vacum clinar ek vilaasi vastu ke rup main hi rah gaya tha; lekin dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad madhyavargon ke bich main ye aam ho gaye
 These have become more prevalent in Western countries, as in most parts of the world, wall-to-wall carpeting and tile or hardwood floors are uncommon in homes, with ease of sweeping, sweeping or mopping
 vacum clinar chakravaat ke siddhant par kaam karanevaala vacum clinar 1990 ke dashak main lokapriy ho gaya, haalanki kuch companiyon ne 1928 se chakravaati sakriyata vaale vacum clinar banaati rahi he
 The modern cyclone cleaner was adapted from the industrial modern cyclone separator in 1985 by British designer James Dyson
 1980 ke dashak main unhone chakravaati clinar ko 1,800 yues dollar main pehali baar japan main launch kiya or baad main 1993 main sidhe euke main 200 pound main dyson disi01 launch kiya
 The expectation was that people would not buy a vacuum cleaner at twice the price of a common vacuum cleaner, but it later became the most popular vacuum cleaner in the UK
 chakravaati clinar main bag kaa upyog hota he, iske bajaay dhul ek aise gol paatr main ikattha hota, jo ki alag kiya jane laayak hota he
 Wind and dust collect in the vessel at high speed in the direction of tangent towards the wall of the vessel, forming a vortex
 dhul ke kanon or anya kacharon ko apkendri bal ke dwaara jahaan ve girti he uskaa kaaran gurutvkarshan hai or paatr ke upree hisse main ek ke baad ek kai sankhya main maheen filter ke se hokar saaf hawa bhavar ke centre se mashin se baahar nikal kar aati he
 The first filter stops the particles that can damage the filter behind it, which removes even more fine dust
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki mashin prabhavi tareeke se kaam karata rahe, filtron ko niyamit rup se saaf kiya yaa badla janaa chahie
 After Dyson, many other companies, including Hover, came up with a cyclone model and the cheapest model was no more expensive than a conventional cleaner
 2000 ke shuruuaat main kai companiyon ne robot "vacum" clinar viksit kiya
 Some examples of this are Rumba, Robomax, intelliboat, Trilobite and Floorboat
 These machines move on their own in a pattern across the floor, cleaning the surface dust and dumping the waste in their trash cans
 ye aamtaur par furnituron ke aasapaas gum sakati he or dobaaraa apane kaam par lag jaati he
 Most robotic "vacuum" cleaners are designed for use at home, although there are more capable models for operation in offices, hotels, hospitals, etc
 jaise ki kuch rumba main asli vacum kaa nirmaan karne ke liye use impeler motor se las kiya gaya he
 By the end of 2003, there were about 570,000 units sold worldwide
 2004 main ek british company ayrider relies kiya, jo ki aage-peeche hone vaala ek aisa vacum clinar tha jo kushan ke upree sataha par tairta he
 It is claimed to be lighter in weight and easier to skill, although it is not the first vacuum cleaner to do so - a hover constellation that is at least 35 years old
 ek vacum kaa kheenchna hawa ke dabaav main antar aane ke kaaran hota he
 An electric fan reduces the pressure inside the machine
 tab vayumandaleey dabaav hawa ko tonti ke jariye kaaleen par dhakka detaa he, jisase dhul puri tarah se bag main pahunch jaataa he
 Tests have shown that cleaning the vacuum pump can wipe out 100% of small fleas and 96% of adult fleas
 ek british avishkaarak ne safai kii ek nai takanic viksit kii he jo air ricycling takanic ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jo kaaleen se ghul ko ikattha karne ke liye vacum ke bajaay hawa ke pravaah kaa upyog karata he
 This technique has been investigated by the Market Transformation Program) and shown that it is much more energy efficient than the vacuum method
 haalanki prototip ke rup main kaam karanevaale kisi bhi clinar ke nirmaan main air ricycling takanic kaa upyog maujuuda samay main nahin ho rahaa he
 Vacuum cleaners have such a configuration: vibhinn tarah ke vishesh sanlagnak, upkaran, brush or vistaar ke liye atirikt danda ke saath zyaadaatar vacum clinron kii aapurti kii jaati he, taaki ve durgam sthanon tak pahunch sake yaa vibhinn tarah ke satahon kii safai ke liye iskaa upyog kiya ja sake
 The most common such devices are: vacum apane swabhaav ke kaaran hawa kii nikasi dwaara hawa ko vahan karti hajo ki puri tarah se chhani hui nahin hoti he
 This can cause problems in health, because the operators ultimately trap dust
 is samasya kaa hal karne ke liye nirmaataa bahut sari paddatiyon kaa prayog karte hai
 Multiple methods can be combined into a single vacuum
 aamtaur par filter ko is tarah lagaaya jaataa he ki motor tak pahunchane se pehle bheetar aanevaali hawa isse hokar gujarey
 saadhaaran vacum clinar, ko esbestose fibre ko saaf karne ke liye istemaal nahin kiya janaa chahie, agar 'hepa' filter laga hua ho to bhi
 The performance of a vacuum cleaner can be measured by several parameters: ek vacum clinar kaa anya byora is prakaar hai: Suction is the difference of maximum pressure that a pump can compose
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek aam gharelu model main sacshan lagbhag 20 kilo pascal rinatmak hota he
 This means that by 20 kpa it can reduce the pressure inside the tube at normal atmospheric pressure
 khinchne kii ucch dar clinar ko or adhik majboot banaati he
 One inch of water is equal to 249 pascals; Therefore, a common suction of water is 80 inches
 clinar main bijli kii khapat, wat main, praayah ekmaatr niyat ankada he
 Many North American vacuum cleaner manufacturers provide electricity only in current amperes and leave the consumer to multiply the line by a voltage of 120 volts to get the power rate in watts
 upabhokta ko bijli clinar kii prabhaavashiltaa kaa sanket nahin, keval bijli kii khapat kitni hui iskaa sanket detii he
 The amount of mana that converts electricity into an air stream is sometimes shown at the end of the scavenger and is measured with an airwatt: its unit is just watts; "wind" refers to its efficiency, not the power consumption
 airwat kii utpatti angreji unit se hui he
 ASTM International defines airwatt as 0
117354 * f * S, where f is the rate of air flow in ft3 / m and s is the pressure in the water inj
 yah ek airwat ko 0
9983 wat ke samaan banataa he
 Some small vacuum cleaners are low-weight, portable, and rechargable rather than using AC power
 kuch vacum clinar main ek hi mashin main sukhi or baad main geeli safai ke liye bijli vaala pochha bhi laga hota he
 The Tirtha Prabandha is the main text written in Sanskrit by the sixteenth century duality philosopher and saint Shri Vadiraj Swami

 San Francisco Pact yah mul rup se mitra deshon kii shaktiyon ke saath hastakshar kiye 1945 main dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad japan ke liye ek shanti kii ranneeti he
 On September 4, 1945, 52 nations gathered at the San Francisco Opera House
 or 49 rashtron ke ant checkoslovakia, poland par 8 sitambar 1945 main is sandhi par hastakshar kiye the or soviet sangh par hastakshar karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 The treaty consists of 7 chapters and 26 articles
 yah mul rup se japan or anya par hastakshar kiye desh ke bich shatrutapurna sthiti ko samaapt karne ke kram main prastaavit or sipahasaalar mudde ko sulajhaa liya gaya he
 The Treaty, which ended World War II, ended Japan's imperialist power
 yah nagarikon or japani yuddh aparaadh ke purv kaidiyon ko muaavja diya tha
 Allied military control ended and sovereignty returned to Japan

 The w dowry, as determined by Japan after these two treaties and the built-up war, symbolizes Japan's relationship with the United States and the influence of its role in the international arena
 san francisco-sandhi kaa aalekh: anuchhed 1- yuddh kii sthiti samaapt ho gaya or japan kii samprabhutaa ko manyata di
 Article 2 - Abolished control of Japan, Sakhalin, and the island of Korea over Pacific Antarctica
 yah america ke liye kikuyu dweep diya anuchhed 3 japan kii suraksha khand sanyukt raashtra charter ke tahat phir se vichaar or samuhik suraksha samjhaute main pravesh karne ke liye japan nirdisht kiya gaya tha
 Article 4 on the political and economic issue, specifying that Japan will return all the exclusive rights and privileges of China
 or sudur purv ke liye antarrashtriya sainya tribunel dwaara kiye gaye faisle ko sweekaar karen
 • It also provided provisions for the revival of commercial treaties
 • yah mitra shaktiyon ke liye emenef kaa darja dene main shaamil the
 Japan's property claims included Article 5 regulation repair and compensation
 anuchhed 6 antarrashtriya nyaayalay ke liye yah charchaa karte hue vivaadon ko hal
 Article 7 defined the ratification process for which it has ever signed a country treaty, which gave favored nation status to someone
 or japan donon dalon ko phayda hua he, jo kisi bhi anya desh ke saath samjhaute ke liye baatcheet karne ke liye anumati di
 What is to be surrendered to the confusion about Taiwan as a nation is because some of the countries supporting Taiwan argued, because the San Francisco Treaty allied power still held control of Taiwan, rather than Taiwan The problem of the legal status of the United States was specifically given to its sovereignty
 sandhi taiwan china kaa hissaa nahin he ki is dharna ko siddh karata he, lekin yah bhi japan ke tyaag ke baad taiwan ke liye samprabhutaa kaa darja pradaan nahin kiya

 Similar small cylindrical wood is called Gilli which is slightly eroded or worn at the edges 
 khel kaa uddeshy danda se gilli ko maarna he
 Putting Gilli on the ground and hitting it on the edges with a pole, which makes Gilli jump in the air
 gilli ko hawa main hi zamin par girane se pehle phir danda se maarthe hai
 The player who reaches Gilli the farthest is victorious
 is khel ke liye kam se kam do khilaadiyo kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 First to start the game
 jameen par ek chota sa lambaa gaddha karte he
 Then, placing a gilli on it, he bounces it with a stick
 yadi saamne khadaa khilaadi gilli ko hawa me hi pakad letaa he to khilaadi haar jaataa he kintu yadi aisa nahi hota to saamne khadaa khilaadi gilli ko dande par martha he jo ki jameen ke gadde par rakhaa hota he, yadi gilli danda par lag jaati he to khilaadi haar jaataa he anyathaa pehla khilaadi phir gilli ko dande se uske kinare par martha he jisase gilli hawa me uchhalati he, ise phir dande se maarthe he or gilli ko dur phekane ko prayaas karte he
 If the gilli is caught in the air, the player loses, otherwise the other player kills the gilli with the same, the second turn comes in the case of the stick
 yadi gilli ko maarthe samay danda jameen se chhu jaataa he to khilaadi ko gilli ko es prakaar maarna hota he ki uskaa danda vaala haath uske ek pair ke neeche rahe
 This is called hoochko
 gilli ko kinare se maarane kaa prayek khilaadi ko teen baar mauka miltaa he
 The maximum number of players in this game is not determined
 is khel main aankh main chot lagane kii sambhaavna rahati he
