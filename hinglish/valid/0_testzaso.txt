 The connection of the Apastamba Dharmasutra appears to be from South India, as the Apastamba branch was prevalent in the south of the Narmada, according to the verses quoted from the composition called 'maharnava'
 swayan aapstamb ne dharmasutragat shraadh ke prakaran main brahmanon ke haath main jal giraane kii pratha 'uttar ke logon main' prachlit he, aisa kahkar dakshin bhartiya hone kaa parichay diya he

 Rechargeable batteries are of different sizes - from button cells to megawatt power systems
 cell ko charge karte samay uskaa dhanatmak sakriy padaarth oxykrut hokar electron detaa he
 At the same time, the negative active substance of the cell is reduced and accepts the electrons
 ye hi electron vahya paripath main dhara pravaah karaate hai
 Electrolytes can act as a simple medium through which ions can easily move from one electrode to another electrode; Or can also take an active part in the electrochemical activity occurring inside the electrolytic cell
 sanchayak bydaree ek yukti he jisamen rasinic urja sanchit kii jaati he, jo kisi bhi samay vidyut ke rup main nirmukt ho sakati he
 There are two types of storage batteries in common use: lead-acid bydaree kaa avishkaar 1859 main french bhautikashastri gaston plante ne kiya tha
 It is the oldest rechargeable battery
 iskaa urja-bhaar-anupaat tathaa urja-aaytan-anupaat bahut kam hota he kintu yah kam samay ke liye bahut adhik dhara pradaan kar sakati he, jiskaa arth yah he ki iske selon kaa shakti-bhaar-anupaat bahut adhik hota he
 Apart from these properties, its cheapness makes it attractive to be used in motorcycles, because the starter motor requires a lot of electric current when starting vehicles
 yah bydaree ek yaa anek sarvasam ikaayiyon kii bani hoti he, jinhen cell kehete hai
 The potential of each cell is two volts
 6 volt kii saadhaaran automobile bydaree main teen cell shreneeyojit hote hai
 Each cell contains acid electrolytes, usually sulfuric acid, and electrodes of sis in two or more chemical forms
 electrode praaia: dhan yaa rin pattica kehalaate hai
 These plates are equipped with a movable frame and electrical conductor, which is called a grid
 grid, dhatvik lead yaa mishradhatu tathaa sakriy lead kaa bana hota he
 The active grid fills the lead recess and performs the necessary electrical chemical work
 grid lead, antimony, tin, bismuth, arsenic tathaa anya tatwon ke alp bhinnaatmak pratishat vaali mishradhatu se dhalkar banaaya jaataa he
 The active substance in Dhana Patikka is lead peroxide
 rin pattica ke sakriy padaarth ye hai : sarrandhra, sookshm vibhajit, swat:baddh dhatvik shuddh lead tathaa alpayojya padaarth, jiskaa kaary sanrandhrata ko banaae rakhana he
 During the lifetime of the battery, the minus plate is repeatedly charged and immersed, thus the additives are required to maintain the stability of the debt plate
 prayavarti dhan tathaa rin patticoon ke madhya main pruthakkaarak lagaakar, in donon patticoon ko pruthak kar samyojit karte hai
 The separator prevents money and loan bars from touching each other
 pruthakkaarak ko amlapratirodhi tathaa vidyut apghaty evam vidyutdhara ke liye saralata se pargamya hona chahie
 This permeability should be fine-grained so that particles of active substances do not enter during the operation of the battery from the money plates
 pruthakkaarak kaa rin pattica ke baad kaa bhaag samtal hota he or dhan pattica ke vipareet ore kaa bhaag khaanchedaar yaa dharidaar hota he
 Generally wood is used more as a separator
 pruthakkaarak ke liye prayukt honevaali lakdi kaa adhikansh regin tathaa amla rasinic kriya dwaara nikaal liya jaataa he
 Some varieties of cedar have proved to be excellent for wood separators: synthetic seperators of fine-grained rubber are also being used extensively
 jalwaayu yaa parivartansheel aavesh dar sambandhi ucch taap kaa saamana karne ke liye kritrim pruthakkaarak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The separator is introduced by a supporting sheet of a porous material, such as glass filaments or perforated rubber
 yah prachlan dhan pattica ke parshv ke vipareet rakhaa jaataa he
 When the battery is overworked, this reinforcement is helpful in the control of the lid of the active material during its lifetime
 lead amla bydaree main vidyut apghaty praaia: tanu salphurik amla, jo bydaree ke aavesh kii avasthaa ke saath saath parivartit hota he, rahata he
 When the battery is charged, the dilution of sulfuric acid is high and the acid concentrates as the battery is immersed
 jab batariyaan purnat: aaweshit rahati hai, tab adhikansh badariyon ke vidyut apghaty kaa aapekshik dhanatv lagbhag 1
280 rahata he, lekin ushn jalwaayu main yah ghanatv 1
125 or thandhi jalwaayu main 1
300 rahata he
 Generally, the relative density of 1
15 relative to electrolyte indicates that the battery is 90 percent immersed
 jab sanchayak aaweshit rahata he, us samay lead, rin pattica or lead oxide,, dhan pattica kaa kaary karata he
 Both these plaques are immersed in the electrolytes of sulfuric acid
 visarjan ke samay sakriy padaarth tathaa vidyut apghaty main rasinic parivartan hota he
 The lead of the minus plaque is deprived of two electrons, while the lead oxide of the fillet plaque yields two electrons
 rin pattica par nimnlikhit abhikriya hoti he : The following synchronous reaction occurs on the money strip: lead monooxide salphurik amla ke saath kriya kar nimnlikhit fal detaa he : In the immersion period, both money and debt plates are covered with lead sulfate
 is samay vidyut apghaty, arthath salphurik amla, kaa aapekshik ghanatv kam ho jaataa he, kyonki kuch salphurik amla pani main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The battery is charged with the current flowing opposite to the direction in which the current is moving while the battery is in action, due to which the battery recovers its original condition, that is, lead sulphate of the fillet is in the precursor of the lead oxide
 goes
 is prakaar rin pattica par hydrogen aayan do electron mukt karata he
 Its reaction is as follows: dhan pattica par sulphate aayan do alectron mukt karata he, jisaki abhikriya nimnlikhit he : Since plumbic sulfate is not stable in water, the final reaction is as follows: aavesh kii abhikriya se vidyut apghaty kaa aapekshik ghanatv bad jaataa he
 The cycle of charge and immersion lasts until the physical structure of the battery is destroyed due to electrical decomposition or oxidation of the separator
 bydaree kii dakshata taap ke parivartan se prabhavit hoti he
 Low heat causes low efficiency
 bydaree ke aaweshit or visarjeet hone kii dar par bhi bydaree kii dakshata nirbhar karti he
 When the battery is charged slowly and immersed slowly, the battery efficiency is high

 He always considered the power of the Vedas to be paramount
 swamiji ne karm siddhanth, punarjanm, brahmacharya tathaa sanyas ko apane darshan ke chaar stambh banaaya
 He first gave the slogan of 'swarajya' in 1876, which was later promoted by Lokmanya Tilak

 Dayanand Saraswati's real name was Moolshankar and his early life was very comfortable
 aage chalakar ek pandit banane ke liye ve sanskrit, veda, shastron va anya dharmik pustakon ke adhyayan main lag gaye
 There were many such incidents in his life which forced him to ask serious questions about the traditional beliefs of Hinduism and God
 ek baar shivaratri kii ghatana he
 Then they were only children
 shivaratri ke us din unka puraa parivaar raatri jaagran ke liye ek mandir main hi rukaa hua tha
 Even after the whole family went to sleep, he kept awake that Lord Shiva would come and receive the Prasad
 unhone dekha ki shivaji ke liye rakhe bhoga ko chuuhe kha rahe hai
 Seeing this, they were very surprised and started thinking that what God will not protect the offerings offered to him will protect humanity? He argued with his father and argued that we should not worship such a helpless God
 apni choti bahan or chachaa kii haije ke kaaran hui mrityu se ve jivan-maran ke arth par gaharaai se sochane lage or aise prashn karne lage jisase unke mata pita chintit rahane lage
 Then his parents decided to marry him at the beginning of adolescence (this was common practice)
 lekin balak mulshankar ne nishchay kiya ki vivaah unke liye nahin bana he or ve 1846 main satya kii khoj main nikal pade
 Maharishi Dayanand has a high sense of idealism in his heart, a natural tendency to take a realistic path, an indomitable zeal to redesign the destiny of the motherland, a keen desire to contemplate religious-socio-economic and political terms and a glorious past among the Aryavarites
 There was a feeling of loyalty
 unhone kisi ke virodh tathaa ninda karne kii parvaah kiye bina aryaavart ke hindu samaaj kaa kayakalp karnaa apana dhyey bana liya tha
 On the day of Shivaratri in Phalgun Krishna Samvat 1895, his life took a new turn
 unhen nayaa bodh hua
 He left the house and while traveling he reached Guru Virjanand
 guruvar ne unhen panini vyakaran, paatanjal-yogasutra tathaa veda-vedang kaa adhyayan karaayaa
 In Guru Dakshina, he sought - show success by learning, doing charity, salvation of the true scriptures, do not eradicate the ignorance of dissenters, remove the darkness of ignorance from the light of Vedas, radiate the light of Vedic religion everywhere
 yahi tumhaari gurudakshina he
 He blessed that God would make his efforts successful
 unhone antim shiksha di -manushyakrut granthon main ishwar or rishiyon kii ninda he, rishikrut granthon main nahin
 Vedas are proof
 is kasuti ko haath se na chhodana
 Maharishi Dayanand traveled to many places
 unhone haridwar main kumbh ke avasar par 'pakhand khandini pataakaa' fahraai
 He did many lectures
 ve kalakatta main babu keshavachandra sen tathaa devendra nath thakur ke sampark main aae
 It is from here that he started wearing full clothes and speaking and writing in Hindi
 yaheen unhone tatkaaleen visarai ko kaha tha, main chahta hum videshiyon kaa rajya bhi purna sukhadaayak nahin he
 But it is very difficult to get rid of different language, different education, different behavior
 bina iske chute paraspar kaa vyavhaar puraa upkaar or abhipraay siddh hona kathin he
 Maharishi Dayanand established the Aryasamaj at Chaitra Shukla Pratipada Samvat in 1932 in Girgaum Mumbai
 aryasamaj ke niyam or siddhant pranimaatr ke kalyaan ke liye he
 To benefit the world is the main objective of this society, that is, physical, spiritual and social progress
 main maanata hoon ki gita main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Also the Gita is not against the Vedas
 vedon ko chhod kar koi anya dharmagranth pramaan nahin he - is satya kaa prachaar karne ke liye swami ji ne saare desh kaa daura karnaa prarambh kiya or jahaan-jahaan ve gayi pracheen parampara ke pandit or vidwaan unase haar maanate gayi
 He had extensive knowledge of Sanskrit language
 sanskrit main ve dharapravaah bolte the
 At the same time, they were very logical
 unhone isai or muslim dharmagranthon kaa bhalee-bhaanti adhyayan-manthan kiya tha
 So alone they started a struggle on three fronts
 do morche to isiyat or islam ke the kintu teesraa morcha sanatandharmee hinduon kaa tha, jinase jujhane main swami ji ko anek apmaan, kalank or ksht jhelane pade
 There was no response to the torch lit by Dayanand
 ve jo kuch kah rahe the, uskaa uttar na to musalmaan de sakate the, na isai, na puraanon par palane vaale hindu pandit or vidwaan
 Hindu Navothan had now come into full light and many sensible people started to feel in their mind that in fact there is no essence in the Pongapanthi of mythological religion
 swamiji prachlit dharmon main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa kadaa khandan karte the chaahe vah sanathan dharm ho yaa islam ho yaa isai dharm ho
 In his Mahagranth Satyarth Prakash, Swamiji has denied the evils prevailing in all opinions
 unke samakaleen sudhaarkon se alag, swamiji kaa mat shikshit varg tak hi simit nahin tha apitu arya samaaj ne aryaavart ke saadhaaran janamanas ko bhi apni ore aakarshith kiya
 In 1872, Swamiji came to Calcutta
 vahaan devendranath thakur or keshavachandra sen ne unka bada satkar kiya
 He also had discussions with Brahmo Samajis, but Brahmo Samaj scholars influenced by Christianity could not agree with Swami regarding the rebirth and authenticity of Veda
 kehete hai kalkatte main hi keshavachandra sen ne swami ji ko yah salaah de daali ki yadi aap sanskrit chhod kar aryabhasha main bolnaa armbh karen, to desh kaa aseem upkaar ho saktaa he
 Since then, the language of Swami Ji's lectures became Aryabhasha and he started to have a lot of followers in the Aryan speaking provinces
 kalkatte se swami ji mumbai padhaare or vahiin 10 april 1875 i
 ko unhone 'arya samaaj' kii sthapana kii
 Prayer community also discussed with him in Mumbai
 kintu yah samaaj to brahmo samaaj kaa hi mumbai sanskaran tha
 Therefore, even the people of this society could not agree with Swami ji
 mumbai se laut kar swami ji indraprastha aae
 There he called a meeting of Christian, Muslim and Hindu priests for Satyansandha
 kintu do dinon ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bhi log kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake
 Swamiji went to Punjab from Indraprastha
 punjab main unke prati bahut utsaah jaagrath hua or saare praant main aryasamaj kii shakhaaen khulne lageen
 Since then, Punjab has been the principal stronghold of the Arya Samajis
 maharishi dayanand ne tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt saamaajik kuritiyon tathaa andhvishwaason or rudhiyon-buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye, nirbhay hokar un par akraman kiya
 They were called 'saints warriors'
 unhone janmana jati kaa virodh kiya tathaa karm ke aadhaar vedanukool varna-nirdhaaran kii baat kahi
 He was a supporter of Dalits
 unhone striyon kii shiksha ke liye prabal aandolan chalaaya
 He prohibited child marriage and sati and supported widow marriage
 unhone ishwar ko sristi kaa nimitt kaaran tathaa prakruti ko anadi tathaa shaashvat mana
 He was an advocate of oilism

 He also believed that the living beings are free to work and are free to enjoy the fruits
 maharishi dayanand sabhi dharmanuayiyon ko ek manch par laakar ekta sthapit karne ke liye prayatnsheel the
 He made such an effort in 1878 during the Indraprastha court
 unke amar granth satyarth prakaash, sanskaar vidhi or rigvedadi bhashya bhoomika main unke moulik vichaar suspasht rup main prapya hai
 He was a yogi and had special emphasis on pranayama

 In the direction of national awakening, he adopted the path of social revolution and spiritual revival
 unki shiksha sambandhi dharanaon main pradarshit doordarshita, deshbhakti tathaa vyavhaarikta purnataya praasangik tathaa uganukool he
 Maharishi Dayanand was not only a social reformer and a pioneer of religious renaissance, he was also a great nationalist and political idealist
 videshiyon ke aryaavart main rajya hone ke kaaran aapas kii foot, matbhed, brahmacharya kaa seven na karnaa, vidhaan padhnaa-padhaana va baalyavastha main aswayamvaravivaah, vishayasakti, mithyaa bhashaavadi, kulakshan, veda-vidya kaa prachaar aadi kukarm hai, jab aapas main bhai-bhai ladte hai or tabhi teesraa videshi aakar panch ban baithta he
 He has also enumerated the qualifications required for the head of state and various councils and committees of government
 unhone nyaay kii vyavastha rishi pranit granthon ke aadhaar par kiye jane kaa paksh liya
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati is generally known only as the founder and social reformer of the Arya Samaj
 rashtriya swatantrata ke liye kiye gaye prayatnon main unki ullekhneey bhoomika kii jaankaree bahut kam logon ko he
 The fact is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had probably first dared to say that "aryavarta belongs to Aryavartis" in the subordinated Aryavarta
 hamaare pratham swatantrata samar, san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn yojana bhi swami ji ke netritv main hi taiyaar kii gai thi or vahi uske pramukh sutaradhar bhi the
 He often preached nationalism to the audience in his sermons and filled the spirit of dying for the country
 1855 main haridwar main jab kumbh mela laga tha to usamen shaamil hone ke liye swami ji ne abu parvat se haridwar tak paidal yatra kii thi
 On the way, he preached from place to place and explored the pulse of the countrymen
 unhone yah anubhav kiya ki log ab angrejon ke atyaachaari shashan se tang aa chuke hai or desh kii swatantrata ke liye sangharsh karne ko aatur ho uthe hai
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati reached Haridwar and camped in a solitary place on a hill there
 vahiin par unhone paanch aise vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii, jo aage chalakar san 1857 kii kranti ke karnadhaar bane
 These five persons were Nana Saheb, Azimullah Khan, Bala Saheb, Tatya Tope and Babu Kunwar Singh
 baatcheet kaaphi lambi chali or yaheen par yah tay kiya gaya ki firangi sarkaar ke viruddh sampoorn desh main sashastr kranti ke liye aadharbhumi taiyaar kii jaae or uske baad ek nishchit din sampoorn desh main ek saath kranti kaa bigul baja diya jaae
 a plan of 'roti Aur Kamal' was also prepared to spread the voice of this revolution among the general public and Aryavartiya soldiers
 is sampoorn vichaar vimarsh main pramukh bhoomika swami dayanand saraswati kii hi thi
 After discussion and planning, Swamiji stopped in Haridwar and the other five national leaders went to their respective places to give realization to the plan
 unke jane ke baad swami ji ne apane kuch vishwast sadhu sanyasiyon se sampark sthapit kiya or unka ek gupt sanghathan banaaya
 The headquarters of this organization was built at the Yogmaya temple at Mehrauli in Indraprastha
 is mukhyalay ne swadhinata samar main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai
 Under the leadership of Swamiji, sadhus also awakened the revolution throughout the country
 ve krantikariyon ke sandesh ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaate, unhen protsaahit karte or aavashyaktaa padane par swayan bhi hathiyaar uthaakar angrejon se sangharsh karte
 During the entire period of the revolution of 1857, the national leader, Swami Dayanand Saraswati remained in constant contact
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa par bhi swami ji niraash nahin the
 He was already aware of the fact that freedom cannot be attained only by trying once
 iske liye to sangharsh kii lambi prakriya chalaani hogi
 At the 1855 meeting in Haridwar itself, when Babu Kunwar Singh asked Swamiji about the possibility of success in this struggle, his answer was "the freedom struggle never fails
" bharat dhire-dhire ek sau varsh main paratantra bana he
 Now it will take one hundred years to become independent as well
 is swatantrata prapti main bahut se anmol praanon kii aahutiyaan daali jaaengi
 "how accurate Swami Ji's prediction turned out to be, was confirmed by subsequent events
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa ke baad jab tathya tope, naanaa sahab tathaa anya rashtriya netaa swami ji se mili to unhen bhi unhone niraash na hone tathaa uchit samay kii pratiksha karne kii hi salaah di
 Two years after the revolution of 1857, Swamiji made Swami Virjanand his guru and took initiation from him
 swami virajanand ke ashram main rahakar unhone vedon kaa adhyayan kiya, un par chintan kiya or uske baad apane guru ke nirdeshaanusaar ve vaidic gyaan ke prachaar-prasar main jute gaye
 To achieve this objective, he also founded the Arya Samaj and through it did many works of social improvement
 chuaachhut, sati pratha, bal vivaah, nar bali, dharmik sankeernata tathaa andhvishwaason ke viruddh unhone jamkar prachaar kiya or vidhwaa vivaah, dharmik udaartaa tathaa aapasi bhaichaare kaa unhone samarthan kiya
 Along with all this, Swamiji never failed to fill the spirit of patriotism among the people
 prarambh main anek vyaktiyon ne swami ji ke samaaj sudhaar ke kaaryon main vibhinn prakaar ke vighn daale or unka virodh kiya
 Gradually, his arguments began to be understood by the people and the protest was reduced
 unki lokapriyata nirantar badhane lagi
 This led to a desire in the minds of British officials that if they were made in favor of the British Government, then through them, the British could be popularized in the general public
 isse purv angrej adhikari isi prakaar se anya kuch dharmopadeshkon tathaa dharmadhikariyon ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan dekar apni taraf mila chuke the
 He also considered Swami Dayanand Saraswati like him
 tadnusaar ek isai padri ke madhyam se swami ji kii tatkaaleen governor general lord northbrook se mulaakaat karavaayi gai
 The meeting took place in Calcutta in March 1873
 idhar-udhar kii kuch aupchaarik baton ke uparant lord northbrook ne vinamrata se apni baat swami ji ke saamne rakhi- "apane vyaakhyaan ke prarambh main aap jo ishwar kii prarthana karte hai, kya usamen aap angreji sarkaar ke kalyaan kii bhi prarthana kar sakenge
 " garvanar general kii baat sunakar swami ji sahaj hi sab kuch samaj gaye
 He also felt pity for the intelligence of the British government, which could not understand him properly
 unhone nirbhikta or dridhtaa se governor general ko uttar diya- The Governor General did not expect such a sharp reply from Swamiji
 mulaakaat tatkaal samaapt kar di gai or swami ji vahaan se laut aae
 After this, the intelligence department of the government had a keen eye on Swami ji and his organization Arya Samaj
 unki prayek gatividhi or unke dwaara bole gaye prayek shabd kaa ricard rakhaa jane laga
 Due to their impact on the general public, the government began to realize that this rebel Fakir and Arya Samaj can become a threat to the government any day
 isliye swami ji ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi tarah-tarah ke shadyantr rache jane lage
 The circumstances under which Swamiji died, give the same impression that there was definitely a conspiracy of the English government in it
 swami ji kii mrityu 30 oktober 1883 ko deepawali ke din sandhyaa ke samay hui thi
 In those days, he had gone to Jodhpur at the invitation of King Naresh Jaswant Singh
 vahaan unke nity hi pravachan hote the
 Sometimes Maharaja Jaswant Singh would also sit at his feet and listen to his sermons there
 do-chaar baar swami ji bhi rajya mehalon main gaye
 There he saw the unnecessary intervention of a prostitute named Nanhi and his immense influence on Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 swami ji ko yah bahut bura laga
 When he explained this to Maharaj, he politely accepted his word and broke the relationship with the little one
 isse nanheen swami ji ke bahut adhik viruddh ho gai
 He got Swami ji's cook Kalia alias Jagannath on his side and got the glass mixed in his milk
 thodi hi der baad swami ji ke paas aakar apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya or uske liye kshamaa maangi
 The benevolent-hearted Swami Ji gave him five hundred rupees for his living and living, so that the police would not disturb him
 baad main jab swami ji ko jodhpur ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya to vahaan sambandhit chikitsak bhi shaq ke daayre main rahaa
 He was accused of giving light poison to Swamiji in the name of medicine
 baad main jab swami ji kii tabiyat bahut kharaab hone lagi to unhen ajmer ke aspataal main laayaa gaya
 But by then there was a lot of delay
 swami ji ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 The apprehension in this entire incident is that the task of raising the prostitute and tricking the doctor was done by a British officer at the behest of the British government
 anyathaa ek saadhaaran veshya ke liye yah sambhav nahin tha ki keval apane balboote par swami dayanand saraswati jaise suprasiddh or lokapriy vyakti ke viruddh aisa shadyantr kar sake
 Without such encouragement and protection, even the doctor could not do this audacity
 swadharm, swabhaasha, swarashtra, swasamskruti or swadeshonnati ke agradoot swami dayanand ji kaa sharir san 1883 main deepawali ke din panchtatv main villin ho gaya or ve apane peeche chhod gaye ek siddhanth, krinvanto vishwamaryam - arthath saare sansar ko shreshth maanav banaao
 His last words were - "lord! You did well
 aapaki ichha purna ho
 " swami dayanand saraswati ne kai dharmik va saamaajik pustaken apni jivan kaal main likhin
 The early books were in Sanskrit, but over time he also wrote many books in Aryabhasa, because Aryabhasa had more reach than Sanskrit
 hindi ko unhone 'aryabhasha' kaa naam diya tha
 Swami Dayanand was the pioneer and early man who used the Aryabhasha for better writing
 swami dayanand saraswati kii mukhya kritiyaan nimnlikhit hai- In 1873, a book called Aryodeshyaratnamala was published in which Swamiji described the definition of one hundred words
 inamen se kai shabd aam bolchaal main aate hai par unke arth rutes ho gaye hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ishwar, dharm, karm, aadi
 They are defined and explained in this book
 is laghu pustika main 8 prishth hai
 In 1881, Swami Dayanand published a book called Gokrunanidhi which also takes credit for playing a major role in establishing the Goraksha movement
 is pustak main unhone sabhi samudaay ke logon ko apane pratinidhi sahit gokrishyaadi raksha samiti kii sadsyta lene ko kaha he jiskaa uddeshy pashu va krishi kii raksha he
 Like modern environmentalists, ideas have been made here

 On 27 February 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati in Udaipur published an acknowledgment in which he handed over the responsibility of philanthropy to 23 persons after his death, who could then carry on their work
 inamen mahadev govind rande kaa bhi naam he
 This acknowledgment is signed as a witness to 13 dignitaries

 daante elegiyari madhyakaal ke italvi kavi the
 He is called the greatest poet of Italy after Virgil
 ye italy ke rashtrakavi bhi rahe
 His famous epic Divine Comedia is an epic symbol of its kind
 iske atirikt unka geetikavy vita nuova, jiskaa arth he nayaa jivan, atyant maarmik kavitaaon kaa ek sangrah he, jisamen unhone apni premika sitris kii premakatha tathaa 23 varshon main hi uske dehavsaan par maarmik virah katha kaa varnan kiya he
 He was born in Europe, Italy
 ye florence ke naagarik the
 His family was ancient, yet not upper-class
 unka janm us samay hua jab madhyayugin vichaardhaara or samskruti ke punarutthan kaa prarambh ho rahaa tha
 Political ideas and arts beliefs were also changing
 dante italy ke sarvshereshth kavi maane jate hai jinke sambandh main angrez kavi shelli ne kaha he ki, The poetry of Dante is like that bridge which is built on the current of time and connects the ancient world with the modern world
 dante ne latin bhashaa main naa likhakar saadhaaran bolchaal kii italvi bhashaa main apana mahakavy likhaa maatrubhaasha or lokprachlit bhashaa ko apni mahaan kritiyon se gauravanvit kiya
 This work was similar to Tulsidas's writing of Ramcharitmanas in the language
 vastav main yah samay vishvabhar main lokbhasha kii pratishtha ke aandolan kaa samay tha
 In India also, Ramanand, Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Vidyapati, Kabir, Sur, Tulsidas, etc
, likewise made a movement for literature in the lingua franca
 vastav main dante kaa yah kaary yugaparivartan kaa shankhanaad tha
 Dante is immortalized by Divine Comedia in the Italian language
 dante keval kavi or vichaarak hi nahin the, varan ve raajnneetik netaa or prashaasak bhi the
 He also ruled the state of Florence
 parantu unke kala or kavy-shaastra sambandhi vichaar unki kriti de valgari elocuo main praapt hote hai
 Not only satisfied with the excellent poem, he also tells what the best poem depends on
 prem jaise vishyon ko or lokbhashaon ko apni rachanaaon main mahatva pradaan karke unhone greek or latin paramparaon ke viruddh ek krantikari padaanyas kiya
 The best creation can be possible only when harmony with Dante's thought, harmonious language, good expressive style and appropriate content
 is prakaar dante ne sarvshereshth rachana ke liye bhadde or graamy shabdon ko chhodkar lokbhasha se or shishtbhaasha se bhi uttam shabdon kaa chayan kar apane kavy kii rachana kii he
 The Vulgery Elocuo Granth has been widely praised by George Sainsbury
 dante ke baad italy main utana bada mahatvapurn kavy chintak kroche ke purv nahin hua
 Apart from Greek and Latin literature, Aligyari Dante also had a special interest in theology
 raajnneeti main vah naram dal kaa anuyaayi or samarthak tha kintu san 1301 main jab guilfon ke krantikari dal dwaara iske paksh kii paraajay hui, tab daante tathaa uske saathiyon ko deshnikale kaa dand bhogana padaa
 Unfortunately, if he was caught by the Florentine government after this conviction, he was likely to be burned alive
 is samay se mrityu paryant vah ek sthaan se duusare or duusare se tisare ek ek tirthayatri kii yaa kareeb kareeb ek bhikhaari kii tarah baraabar bhatakta rahaa
 These days its position was like a rudderless boat
 dar dar kii thokaren khate hue usne badi katutaa ke saath anubhav kiya ki duusare ke ghar kii roti kitni swadaheen hoti he or paraye ghar kii sidhiyon par chadhate utarate rahane main kitni pidaa kaa anubhav hota he
 In 1316, a public declaration was made by Florence, and on some derogatory terms, she was also allowed to return to Florence
 usne ise thukraa die or ant tak pravaas main hi jeevanyaapan kaa nishchay kiya
 He died in Ravenna in 1321 and was buried there
 ravenna ke adhikari aaj bhi uske shav ko uski janmabhoomivaalon ko lautaane ke liye taiyaar nahin, jinhone uske saath aisa nindaneey vyavhaar kiya tha
 The names of the two women are closely associated with the life of the teeth
 ek he biatris portinari or duusari jemya donaati
 The first was her puberty beloved whom she saw when she was only nine years old
 simon di bardi ke saath biatris kaa vivaah ho jane tathaa thode hi samay ke bheetar san 1290 main uski mrityu ho jane ke baad bhi daante uske anuraag main duba rahaa
 The second woman, Gemya, was his married wife with whom he was married in 1277
 daante ke nirvasit hone par usne uskaa saath nahin diya
 It is clear that the teeth were not satisfied with his behavior and color, and later started hating him
 daante kii rachanaaon kii suvidha kii drushti se ham teen bhaagon yaa kaalon main baant sakate hai
 In the first part, those works can be kept in which the enthusiasm of youth and its fervent affection for Biatris is reflected in religious conversion
 isaki avadhi mote taur par 1283 se 1290 tak maani ja sakati he
 The most important composition of this period is Vita Nuova
 doosraa bhaag viatris kii mrityu ke baad shuru hota he
 It can be expanded from 1291 to 1313
 is kaal main uskaa jivan niraashaa, du:kha evam vishwaas par asthaayee rup se tarkbuddhi kaa praadhanya chaa gaya or uskaa jhukaav darshan tathaa vigyaan kii or adhik ho gaya
 He continued to indulge in a tussle or schemes in the acrimony of political quarrels
 is kaal kii mukhya rachanaayen hai - di konvivio, di moderkiya, di ipicills aadi
 From King Henry VII, Dante had set great hopes on which his death was destroyed
 uski samast yojanaayen ekaek samaapt ho gai kintu ganimat yahi rahi ki ve uskaa sampurna hausala post na kar sakin
 He once again moved towards spiritual balance
 yuvavastha ke vichaar or vishwaas usamen pun: jaag uthe or vah divangat biatris kii pavitribhoot aatma kii upasna kii ore or bhi dridhtaa se unmukh ho uthaa
 In many poems of 'divine Comedy', its evidence is scattered
 daante kii rachanaaon kaa yah teesraa kaal 1314 se 1321 tak, yane uski mrityu ke samay tak, mana ja saktaa he
 We can call 'the Vita Nuova' as Italy's first erotica
 isamen kavihruday kii ukt bhaawanaaon ke manovaigyanik vishleshan kii jhalak hamen dekh padati he
 How her new life started only after the first darshan of Biotris, how the woman's sense of beauty and beauty continued to get stronger in her heart, how she slowly got her hopes and love and devotion
 It became a center, at the same death, how much mental anguish and ecstasy he suffered and how his earthly love finally culminated in divine devotion and worship
 This can be seen in poetry
 biatris kii mrityu ke baad uskaa dhyaan kuch varshon ke liye ihlokik bhaawanaaon, vichaaron tathaa swaarthon kii ore gaya or vah niraashaaon athwa sanshayon ke bich hilore khaane laga
 We can see this in his second work 'conbaivs'
 in donon rachanaaon main biatris kahan or kab ek alokik saundarya kii pratimaa prathit hoti he or kahan vah maatr ek darshanik athwa dharmik drushti se kalpit divya chaaya si dekh padati he, iskaa vivechan karnaa anaavashyak he
 Suffice it to say that 'vita Nuova' is a mental elevation of the poet towards a higher sattvikta and reverence rather than an ordinary love story
 isamen andeh nahin ki aashaa niraashaaon ke vividh antardvandvon ke baavjood daante kaa hriday baar baar isi ore prayavarti hone ke liye sachesht hota jaan padataa he
 In fact, it is only from the last part of the poetry that one begins to cast a shadow on the poet's psyche, the focal world, whose center was Biatrice, and which mattered in his poetic poem called 'divine Comedy'
 daante kii laathini rachanaaon main 'de monarkia' vishesh ullekhneey he
 It shows that the need of the empire is in a way supported by God
 unamem rajya tathaa carch yaa dharmik sanstha ke pruthak pruthak kshetra kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he or is baat par bal diya gaya he ki pope kii satta keval dharmik maamalon tak hi simit rahani chahie
 Thoughts of this intention have been expressed in many of the letters to him in the collection of Ephesians

 Brahmi and Devanagari script: The practice of writing the language in scripts started in India itself
 bharat se ise sumerion, babyloniyan or unani logon ne siikhaa
 Brahmi and Devanagari script was practiced in ancient times
 brahmi or devanagari lipiyon se hi duniyabar kii anya lipiyon kaa janm hua
 The Brahmi script is an ancient script from which many Asian scripts have developed
 brahmi bhi kharoshtee kii tarah hi puure asia main faili hui thi
 It is said that the Brahmi script is 10,000 years old but it is also said that this script is even older than that
 samraat ashok ne bhi is lipi ko apanaaya : mahaan samraat ashok ne brahmi lipi ko dhammalipi naam diya tha
 The Brahmi script is also considered ancient than the Devanagari script
 kaha jaataa he ki yah pracheen sindhu-saraswati lipi se nikali lipi he
 People of Harappan culture used this script in addition to the Indus script, when Sanskrit language was also written in this script

 The most developed stage is considered to be the phonetic script
 "devanagari" ko aksharatmak isliye kaha jaataa he ki iske varna- akshar hai- swar bhi or vyanjan bhi
 The consonants "a", "b", etc
 are recitation - are inaccurate
 ve keval dhvaniyaan nahin hai apitu saswar akshar hai
 Hence, there are alphabets like Greek, Roman etc
 parantu yahan yah dhyaan rakhane kii baat he ki bharat kii "brahmi" yaa "bharti" varnmaala kii dhvaniyon main vyanjanon kaa "panini" ne varnsamamnay ke 14 sutron main jo swaroop parichay diya he- uske vishay main "patanjali" ne yah spasht bataa diya he ki vyanjanon main saniyojit "akar" swar kaa upyog keval uccharan ke uddeshy se he
 It is not essentially a part of the varna
 is drushti se vichaar karte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki is lipi kii varnmaala tatvat: dhvanyatmak he, aksharatmak nahin
 The alphabet of Devanagari has 12 vowels and 34 consonants
 shunya yaa ek yaa adhik vyanjanon or ek swar ke mail se ek akshar banataa he

 In Sanskrit, Ai is a combination of two vowels and is spoken like "A-I" or "A-I"
 isi tarah ou "a-u" yaa "aa-u" kii tarah bolaa jaataa he
 Apart from this, these alphabets in Hindi and Sanskrit are also considered vowels: jab kisi swar prayog nahin ho, to vahaan par 'a' mana jaataa he
 The absence of a vowel is indicated by a plow or a pause
 jaise ki k kh g gh

 bhartiya mul ke log sansar main jahaan-jahaan bhi rahete hai, ve devanagari se parichay rakhte hai, visheshkar marishas, surinam, fiji, gayana, trinidad, tubago aadi ke log
 In this way, the Devanagari script can not only bind all the provinces in India in love, but can also make 'bahujan Hitay, Bahujan Sukhay' and make different countries a more smooth and scientific One can claim the title of 'vishwa Nagari' in the twenty-first century by providing an alternative

 Devanagari can be the best option for many languages of the world as it gives complete freedom to speak

 This is the first time a statue of a Muslim or Asian woman is installed in Britain
 gordon square gardens main us maqaan ke nazadik pratimaa sthapit kii gai he jahaan vah bachapan main rahaa karti thim
 The statue was unveiled on 8 November 2012 by Princess Anne, daughter of Queen Elizabeth II

 It is noteworthy that London's Garden Square, built in memory of Noor, is the first monument to be built in the memory of an Indian woman and a Muslim woman in Britain
 is pratimaa ko landan ke kalakaar newman ne banaaya he
 Civil identity purvaj Family members sainya kariyar Despite being hostile to the British Empire, Noor spied for Britain and set a new precedent, but did she have a place in history that she deserved? The interesting question is how did Sufi music lover and very beautiful woman Noor become a detective during World War II? Shrabani Basu, an Indian-origin journalist based in London, has tried to find out the answers to some such questions through her book "spy Princess" - Detective Princess - Noor Inayat Khan

 Celebrities like Shami Chakraborty, Gurinder Chadha, Anushka Shankar and Nina Wadia also supported her
 maine britain main bharatiyon ke yogadan ke bare main kahin ek lekh padhaa tha jisamen nur inayat khan kaa naam bhi tha
 It was written that she was a British spy but had little information about him
 alabatta unki ek tasviir chhapi thi jisamen vah bahoot kuubasurat nazar aa rahi thim
 Just then, my interest arose that something should be done about them
 —shrabani basu, lekhika Indian filmmakers Tabrez Noorani and Zafar Hai are going to present Noor's story on the big screen

 ganit main do ghaat vaale sameekaran ko varg sameekaran yaa dwighat sameekaran kehete hai
 In many situations in science, technology and other situations, one often encounters the square equation when solving a problem
 isaliye varg sameekaran kaa hal bahut mahatv rakhata he
 The general equation of the square equation is as follows: yahan a ≠ 0
 ho jate hai
 ) varg sameekaran ko nimnlikhit rup main bhi likh sakate hai- The coefficients of a square equation can be real numbers or complex numbers
 kisi varg sameekaran ke do mul hote hai hon) ; arthath char raashi ke do maanon ke liye diya gaya varg sameekaran santusht ho saktaa he
 They can either be original or they can be complex numbers
 dwighat sameekaran ke mul nimnlikhit sutara kii sahaayta se praapt kiye ja sakate hai: "±" here means that dono hi iske hal hai
 The formula for the roots of x 2 + px + q = 0 { \ displaystyle x ^ {2} + px + q = 0 \ quad} is the following: nimnlikhit sameekaran ke mul nikaaliye- x 2 + 16 x + 50 = 5 x 2 + 4 x + 10 { \ displaystyle x^{2}+16x+50=5x^{2}+4x+10} By converting this equation to normal form, 0 = 4 x 2 − 12 x − 40 { \ displaystyle 0=4x^{2}-12x-40} The origins of which are as follows: x 1, 2 = − ± 2 − 4 ⋅ 4 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 4 { \ displaystyle x_{1,2}={ \ frac {- \ pm { \ sqrt {^{2}-4 \ cdot 4 \ cdot }}}{2 \ cdot 4}}} That is x 1 = - 2 { \ displaystyle x_ {1} = - 2} and x 2 = 5 { \ displaystyle x_ {2} = 5} p-q-sutara kaa prayog karne ke liye sameekaran ke saamaanya rup ko nimnlikhit rup main badalte hai- 0 = x 2 - 3 x - 10 { \ displaystyle 0 = x ^ {2} -3x -10} ab p-q-sutara se nimnlikhit mul milte hai- x 1, 2 = - - 3 2 ± 2 - { \ displaystyle x_ {1,2} = - { \ frac {-3} {2}} \ pm { \ sqrt { \ left ^ {2} -}}} arthath x 1 = − 2 { \ displaystyle x_{1}=-2} tathaa x 2 = 5 { \ displaystyle x_{2}=5} The solutions of the square equation have been derived in different ways since ancient times
 euclid ne varg sameekaran ke hal kii jyamitiya paddati bataayi thi
 Aryabhata and Brahmagupta have described in its words the method of extracting its origin which can be written as following in modern algebraic form- is samikaran ko nimnlikhit rup main vyavasthit kiya jaay, jaisaa ki baanyi taraf ke chitra main varnit he- This gives the following solution in the modern form clearly- brahmagupta ne brahmasphutsiddhanth main varg sameekaran ke hal kaa nimnlikhit sutara diya he- Meaning: Add the square of half of the coefficient of latent amount ie 2) with the expressed amount

 Then divide the coefficient of unknown amount by a
 isse avyakt raashi kaa maan praapt hota he
 Durgbandi or fortification is the name of the system of resistance to and protection from the enemy
 iske antargat ve sabhi sainik nirmaan or upkaran aate hai jo apane bachaav ke liye upyog kiye jate hai 
 At present, fortification comes under military engineering
 yah do prakaar kii hoti he: sthaayee or asthaayee
 For permanent fortifications, construction of fortified fortifications, which have a means of protection, is necessary
