 Crime or conviction is defined in different forms; As such, in paribhaashaon ke anusaar kisi nagarpalika ke banaae niyamon kaa ulanghan kar yadi koi raat main bina batti jalaae cycle par nagar kii sadak par chale athwa bina paryaapt kaaran ke train kii zanjeer khinchakar gaadi khadi kar de, to vah bhi usee prakaar doshi mana jayega, jis tarah koi kisi kii hatya karne par
 But in the ordinary sense, people take the punishment as synonymous with murder, dacoity and other crimes
 loukik mat ke anusaar koi chaalak yadi teji evam asaavadhaanee se motor chalaate hue kisi ko apni gaadi se kuchal de to vah apradhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, yadi uske man main aparaadh karne kii bhaavana na rahi ho
 According to the traditional beliefs, there are two things for the completion of the conviction - yadi koi chori karne ke abhipraay se kisi ke ghar kii khidki se ghar ke andar kii chizon ko dekhe tathaa raatri main send lagaakar chori karne kii yojana banaakar hi laut jaay to usapar chori ke aparaadh kaa abhiyog nahin lagaaya ja saktaa, kyonki apradhi man kii yojana kaa karyanvayan nahin hua, bhale hi duusare ke ghar main anadhikaar pravesh karne ke liye vah doshi kyon na ho
 For the perfection of the crime of theft, it is necessary to touch the things of others at least
 at: vah vyakti yadi apni yojana ke anusaar raatri main send lagaakar us ghar kii chijen uthaa le jaay tabhi vah chori ke liye apradhi hoga
 But with the development of modern civilization, due to the complexity in the society, new laws are being made every day, due to which the defective mind theory of impunity is disappearing
 saadhaarant: jo swayan aparaadh kare yaa dusron ke dwaara aparaadh karaave, vahi dandit hoga
 Therefore, the owner cannot be liable for the trespass offense of his servant
 kintu ek simit varg ke maamalon main, jahaan aparaadh karne kii maansik pravriti aavashyak nahin he, yadi koi sevak apane saadhaaran kaary ke dauraan main koi aparaadh kare yaa kanoon dwaara nirdhaarit kisi kaam ko na karne se apradhi bane, to unka swami aparaadh ke liye uske saath saath doshi hoga; bhale hi swami ko sevak ke kaam kii yaa nirdhaarit kaam main truti kii khabar na rahi ho, yaa sevak ne swami ke aadesh ke viruddh kii kaam kyon na kiya ho athwa nirdhaarit kaam karne se virat hua ho
 There can be different reasons for conviction; As such, momentary impulses, sentimentality, forethought, protection from future destruction, etc
 drushtaant ke liye raajnneetik hatyaon ko le sakate hai
 In order to fulfill a political goal, some people conspire and kill the head of state
 aisa purv vichaar se hi hota he, kshanik aaveg se nahin
 The direct killer commits a crime out of sentimentality, greed for money, or the accomplishment of his team's target
 uske giraftaar hone par is ashanka se ki kahin vah rahasy kaa udghaatan kar apane saathiyon kaa vinaash na karvaa de, shadyantrakaari uskaa vadh kar dete hai
 Likewise, when a robber falls injured while robbery, his companions cut him off his head for being unable to carry him, so that he cannot be identified by his dead body or get forgiveness when he is alive
 With assurance, he should not reveal the secret of his team
 janm yaa anuvanshikta kaa dandabhiyog se kya sambandh he, nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa; kintu ham vaataavaran ke prabhaav asweekaar nahin kar sakate

 This institution maintains a healthy environment, which helps in the improvement of criminals
 unhen upyogi vyavsaay kii bhi shiksha di jaati he, taaki dand kii nirdhaarit avadhi puri kar ghar lautne par ve sachai se apni jeevika chalaa saken
 a person can be a criminal either himself or in the form or can be helpful before or after the incident
 koi yaa to swayan aparaadh karata he yaa anya kisi agent se karaata he, jo kanuunan aparaadh ke liye uttaradaayi nahin hota, yatha saat saal se kam avasthaa kaa shishu, koi pashu yaa koi mashin
 Such a person is called the prime culprit
 dwitiya shrenee kaa pradhan vah he jo ghatnasthal par upasthit rahakar pradhan ko aparaadh karm main sahaayta detaa he yaa use protsaahit karata he
 The assistant before the incident is the one who encourages the head to commit the crime but is not present at the time of the crime
 ghatana se pashchaat kaa sahaayak vah he jo yah jaanate hue ki kisi ne gurutar aparaadh kiya he, use sharan detaa he yaa use bhaagane main sahaayta pahunchaata he
 It is worth remembering that all the people involved in treason are the main culprits

 It is beyond anyone's ability to approve that he will not bring a penalty
 kanoon dwaara nirdisht kuch apwaadon ko chhodkar dandabhiyog kii koi avadhi bharat yaa england main nahin he
 The accused is always responsible for his crime, no matter how much time is spent from the date of the crime
 europe ke deshon main aparaadh kii tithi se 20 saal ke baad koi abhiyog nahin laayaa ja saktaa

 Its principle is based on the fact that one is defeated by circumstances and leads to crime
 yatha, arth yaa naitik sankat kisi ko duusare kii sampatti kaa apharan karne ko protsaahit kar saktaa he
 Insanity or mental imbalance also promote crime
 at: vaigyanik upachaaron ke prayog se tathaa paristhiti ko anukool kar apradhi ko aparaadh se virat karnaa chahie
 In other words this science supports "correction" in place of "punishment"

 Transparency means openness, easy access to information and accountability
 kisi bhi loktantric raajnneetik vyavastha main javabdehi or paardarshita buniyadi mulya hai
 Whether it is government or bureaucracy, parties or non-governmental voluntary organizations, everyone is expected to be accountable and transparent to the people
 sarkaar or naukarshahi ko janata ke prati javabdeh banane or unke kaamkaaj main paardarshita laane ke uddeshy se bhartiya sansad ne 15 june 2005 ko soochna ke adhikaar kanoon ko paarit kiya

 After getting the right to information, its use started and active citizens started getting such information from the government which could not have been thought of before
 isse sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par kuch ankush laga or paardarshita bhi badi
 But the internal functioning of the political parties controlling and governing the various organs of the government, the decision-making process and the sources of funding they received still remained hidden in the veil of secrecy

 After taking power from whom money is taken, it becomes a compulsion of the ruling political party to oblige them
 isliye in dalon ko milane vaale dhan ke strot ke bare main janata ko jaankaree hona bahut jaruri he
 Apart from this, it is also necessary for the public to know how much democracy is there within the political parties active in democracy and what process they go through and make their decisions

 vyapaar or kanoonee lenden main, ashwasti yaa varanti, ek party dwaara duusari party ko diya gaya yah aashwaasan he ki kuch khaas tathy yaa sthitiyaan sahi hai, yaa hongi; duusari party ko us aashwaasan par bharosa karne kii anumati di jaati he or agar vah aashwaasan galat hota he yaa uskaa paalan nahin kiya jaataa he to uske liye kuch upachaar hasil karne kii vyavastha hoti he
 In real estate transactions, a warranty deed is a promise that the buyer's ownership of a land will be defended
 ek varantee ko vyakt kiya ja saktaa he yaa vah nihit ho sakati he
 There is a guarantee from the seller of the product that specifies the extent to which an assurance of the quality or performance of that product is assured and an explanation of the conditions under which that product may be returned, to be changed
 Can be, or can be repaired
 ise aksar ek vishisht, likhit "varantee" dastavej ke rup main diya jaataa he
 However, a warranty may also arise from the seller's description of the goods and perhaps even legal rules based on their source and quality, and any variation of material from that specification would violate the guarantee
 For example, an advertisement describing a product is often filled with express warranties; That product must conform to the advertised description
 Many advertisers include disclaimers for this purpose
 Generally, a written warranty assures the buyer that the item is of good quality and is defective in "material and design"
 ek express varantee ko maukhik rup se, likhit or vastav main vikreta dwaara varantee banane ke kisi iraade ke bina banaaya ja saktaa he
 In the United States, a seller is allowed to form his own opinion for the price known as puffery and which a buyer cannot rely on as the basis of the transaction
 For example, "this hunter knife is the best knife in the world" is simply over-praise, while a statement such as "this hunter knife is never required to be sharpened" can be interpreted as an express warranty when Even that knife is used for its intended purpose
 kuch anya deshon main, aise upabhokta sangrakshan kanoon maujuud hai jo vigyapandaataaon ko asaty yaa asiddh bayaan dene se rokte hai
 Misuse of a well-known trademark can also convey an express warranty, the violation of which is called "passing off"; The source and quality of the goods were misrepresented
 kuch utpaadon ke saath varantee hoti he jiske tahat maheene, saal yaa aaajeevan marammat yaa pratisthaapan kaa vaada hota he
 In theory, a person can return a product to a "dealer" for repair, but most shops — and also manufacturers — who sell such products lack repair facilities
 car dealron ke paas aisi marammat kii dukaane hoti hai jiske chalate bahut se log nai kaaren kharidte hai; computer dealer or upabhokta electronics dealron ke paas 1990 ke dashak main is tarah kii dukaane hua karti thim, lekin inamen se adhikansh ab lupt ho chuki hai
 In practice, a product that fails within a month can be replaced by a new one under the shop's guarantee; Or a product that fails after the store's guarantee expires but has a manufacturer's guarantee remaining can be replaced by the manufacturer - the store guarantee and the manufacturer's warranty are mutually exclusive
 kabhi aisi marammat kii dukaane hua karti thim jo chote vidyut upkarnon ke liye varantee seva pradaan karti thim, jaise ki vidyut reiser yaa lamp or toster; lekin 1980 ke dashak main, unamem se adhikansh patr agreshan seva main badal gaye jo varantee vaale utpaada ko nirmaataaon ke paas pratisthapit karne ke liye bhejte the or unamem se adhikansh 1990 ke dashak main gaayab ho gaye
 There are some exceptions: Some companies - notably Toshiba - actually repair products under warranty
 thomas freedman bataate hai ki kaise toshiba ne upies ke maamle main varantee kaaryon ko sabhaalane ke liye ek vyavastha kaa nirmaan kiya: ek graahak, jisane toshiba kii website se sidhe computer kaa order diya he, vah upies ke madhyam se kharaab computer ko toshiba ko bhej saktaa he
 In fact, he never reaches Toshiba
 balki upies, toshiba-computer kii marammat kii swayan kii dukaane rakhata he
 When UPS picks up the user's computer, it sends it to the UPS shop, where it is fixed, tested, and returned to the user within a specified time frame

 An implied warranty is one that arises from the understanding of the nature of the deal and the buyer's implied rather than the express representations of the seller
 vanijopayogita kii varantee garbhit hoti he, jab tak ki naam dwaara spasht rup se asweekaar naa ho, yaa bikri ko is vaakyansh ke saath pahachaanaa gaya ho "yatha rup main" yaa "sabhi dosha ke saath
" "vikrey" hone ke liye, maal ko ek saadhaaran kreta kii ummiido ke yathochit anukool hona chahie, arthath ve vahi hai jo ve kehete hai
 For example, a fruit that has a good appearance and aroma but which has hidden defects will violate the commercial utility warranty if its quality does not meet the standards of a fruit that is "commonly established in business"
 In Massachusetts consumer protection law, it is illegal to reject this warranty on household consumer goods, etc
 vishesh uddeshy ke liye fitness kii varantee tab nihit hoti he jab ek kharidaar ek vishisht anurodh ke anukool maal chayan ke liye vikreta par nirbhar karata he
 For example, this warranty is violated when a buyer asks for a snow tire from a mechanic and in return receives tires that are unsafe for use in snow
 is nihit varantee ko naam dwaara spasht rup se asweekaar kiya ja saktaa he, jisase kharabi ke jokhim ko waapas kharidaar par daal diya jaataa he
 a lifetime warranty is usually on the life of a product in the market and not on the consumer's lifetime
 If a product has been discontinued and is no longer available, the warranty may last a limited period
 udhaaharan ke liye, cisco simit jeevankaal varantee utpaada ko band kar die jane ke baad vartmaan main paanch saal tak rahati he
 The importance of the used / second-hand products market as a share of the total market has been growing significantly since the beginning of the twenty-first century
 second-hand utpaadon main ve utpaada shaamil hai jo pehle kisi upabhokta / upyogkarta dwaara istemaal kiye ja chuke hai
 Users change their products even when they are in good condition
 computer or mobile phone jaise kuch utpaadon kaa ek laghu jeevankaal hota he or in utpaadon kii praudyogikiyaan bazaar main aae din jari hoti rahati hai
 As a result, the sale of new products is often associated with a replacement system, resulting in a market for second-hand products
 udhaaharan ke liye, france main istemaal kii gai kaaron kii ikai bikri 1990 or 2005 ke bich 4

 a warranty is breached when a promise is broken; At the time of sale, when the goods are not as expected, whether the defect is obvious or not
 The seller must return the money or replace Vastu in time, respecting that warranty
 If the seller refuses to honor the warranty, then she commences time under the statute of sale period for a court complaint of breach of warranty
 is avadhi ko aksar vahaan andekha kiya jaataa he jahaan ek "vistaarit varantee" hoti he, jisamen ek vikreta yaa nirmaataa us vistaarit avadhi ke bheetar vifal hone vaale maal kii marammat yaa use pratisthapit karne kii atirikt seva pradaan karne kaa anubandh karata he
 However, if the goods were defective at the time of sale and the relevant statute has not expired, the existence or duration of any "extended warranty" is secondary: there is a breach of a primary warranty for which the seller could have been liable
 
 apraasangik vistaarit varantee kii samaapti kaa daawa karte hue praathmik varantee ke ulanghan kii javabdehi se bachane kaa prayaas karnaa ek anuchit or bhraamak vyapaar abhyaas ho saktaa he
 a term law claim in a contract may be shorter than a tort claim and some cases of warranty breach are filed late and are recognized as a fraud or other related tort
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek upabhokta ek vastu kharidta he jo package se baahar karne se pehle hi pataa chalata he ki tuuti hui he yaa uske hisse laapata hai
 This is a defective product and can be returned or replaced to the seller, regardless of what the seller's "return policy" is, even after the issue has been inaugurated after the "extended warranty" has expired Have happened Likewise, if the product is prematurely damaged, it may be that it was defective at the same time it was sold and could then be returned or replaced
 yadi vikreta varantee kaa apmaan karata he, to ek anubandh daawey ko adaalat main shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 In retail trade, a warranty generally refers to a product's guarantee of reliability under normal use conditions
 ise "vistaarit" varantee kaha jaataa he kyonki iske tahat un dosha ko shaamil kiya jaataa he jo bikri kii taarikh ke baad utpann ho sakate hai
 If after purchasing a product, it malfunctions within a specified period of time, then it is usually necessary for the manufacturer or distributor to replace, or repair, or return the item to the customer
 Such warranties typically involve "natural disaster", misuse by the owner, malicious destruction, commercial use, or anything else that has occurred outside of a mechanical fault in general personal use
 Most warranties do not include parts that are normally perishable and supplies that must be replaced after a certain period of time as they are normally used
 An extended warranty may be included in the purchase price, or optionally extended with an additional charge and may be extended annually and at the same time a "lifetime" in that product
 tritiy-paksh varantee pradaata, dheron utpaadon ke liye vaikalpik "vistaarit varantee" samjhauta pradaan karte hai, jise us utpaada ke liye beemaa kaa ek anubandh mana jaataa he
 Third parties are sold through various small, self-insured companies as well as by large, well-known store chains such as Best Buy and Circuit City
 As is the case with other types of insurance, companies gamble that products will be reliable and the warranty will be forgotten, or any claim will be settled cheaply
 Some third party companies provide their own assistance such as JTF Business Systems; These companies remove defective parts and send them back to the manufacturer for replacement
 vistaarit varantee ko aamtaur par nirmaataa ke madhyam se pradaan nahin kiya jaataa he, balki swatantra prashaskon ke madhyam se badhaayaa jaataa he
 In some circumstances it may serve the consumer's interest that the product is insured from a company that is outside the place of purchase and / or the place of service
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab ek auto varantee ko ek car dilarship ke madhyam se pradaan kiya jaataa he, to yah aamtaur par ek up-anubandhit varantee hoti he, jahaan vaahan kii marammat kaa sauda nimna dar par tay kiya jaataa he, jisamen aksar seva, shram or part ke saath nimna maanak par samjhauta kiya jaataa he
 Many times this type of warranty requires an unexpected expense at the time of repair, such as: - unexpected services provided outside the warranty terms - non-warranty portion and labor rate - paying the full balance while a reimbursement
 The arrangements have been made through the dealership / warranty claim offices
 Some mechanics and merchant service centers can postpone or replace necessary repairs
 Even dealerships have went not void warranty that came not under repair costs of their warranty or applicable general store rate
 ek beemaa seva samjhaute kaa *sachcha sahitya aapke vistaarit auto varantee kii gunvattta ko nirdhaarit karne kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahalu he
 a fully insured auto warranty, sometimes offered at wholesale rates or similar, may be worth the price difference, if any
 True literature is a contract written on your behalf, which must contain your name and your product ID number or vehicle ID number must be written on paper
 This is your true literature and whenever working with a contract there are always different "terms and Conditions", so make sure that you only deal with the companies that offer such service contracts
 This type of warranty is noticeably different than company subcontracted, internal, retail, and third-party warranty companies, simply because it will cover a higher shop rate and allow the customer to operate outside the dealership as well Will allow to choose a different mechanic across the country
 Insured warranties often repair before the vehicle is serviced, sanyukt rajya america main kharidaaron or vikritaon ke adhikaar or upachaar ko uniform comershial code ke anuchhed 2 dwaara shasit kiya gaya he kyonki iske swaroop main ek rajya se duusare rajya se bhinnata he

 While in the US, warranties are generally given in writing that are subject to the control of law, warranties in other countries may be governed by specific statutes
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek desh kaa kanoon yah vyavastha de saktaa he ki maal ko vikreta dwaara 12 maheene kii avadhi ke liye bimit kiya janaa chahie or or ek utpaada kii vifaltaa kii sthiti main anya vishesh adhikaar or upachaar uplabdh kara saktaa he

 "here, a warranty is more as an assurance," as the supplier warrants that all its employees working on the project will be subject to confidentiality agreements including the supplier's ability to seek injunctive relief for infringement
 " agar abhyavedan or varantee sahi nahin hai yaa puri nahin kii jaati hai to aksar aisi sthiti ke liye vishisht upachaar yaa parinaam nirdisht hai
 For example, a seller may make representations and warranties that it has full ownership rights to the goods sold and there is no legal impediment to the seller regarding that transaction
 agar pataa chalata he ki vikreta ke paas purna adhikaar nahin he yaa vah kisi anya sahmati ke adheen he jisane bikri ko pratibandhit kiya or agar iske chalate khariddaar ke swaamitv main asar padataa he to yaa use uske liye vyay karnaa padataa he, to kharidaar ke paas samjhaute ke tahat vikreta se raahat paane kaa adhikaar he
 In these transactions, the parties usually demand representations and warranties about the issues they are concerned about
 abhyavedan or varantee banane ke parinaamon kii vajah se, aamtaur par partiyaan uski simaaon ko pratibandhit karne kii koshish karti hai
 The tension between these two points helps to shape the negotiations between the parties regarding the terms and conditions of the agreement
