 unke apane vichaar the ki vanya jeev sangrakshan ke abhyaas ko vyaavhaarikta kii aavashyaktaa he or use ahimsa jaise darshan par aadhaarit nahin karnaa chahie
 He said that this fundamental religious sentiment was a hindrance in the development of bird studies in India
 it is true that i despise purposeless killing, and regard it as an act of vandalism, deserving the severest condemnation
 But my love for birds is not of the sentimental variety
 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics

 dishtakaari yaa rujukari yaa ractifire aisi yukti he jo aavarti dhara ko dishtdhaara main badalane kaa kaary karti he
 That is, rectifiers, a

 From dc Is the changer
 dishtakaari bahut upyogi he kyonki aajkal ke bahut se upkaran disi se hi chalate hai jabaki baahar se unhen e-si hi di jaati he
 Solid state diodes, vacuum-tube diodes, mercury-arc-valves, selenium diodes and scrs for decimation
 Etc
 are used
 ardhchaalak diod ke aane ke pehle nirvaat-nalika diod yaa copper-oxide yaa selenie-stack dishtakaari prayog main aate the
 The device working opposite to the work of rectifier is called inverter
 praayah sabhi dishtakaari ek yaa adhik diodon ko vishesh kram main jodkar banaaye jate hai
 DC is usually more pure by using more diodes i
e
 is tarah ke dishtakaari main e-si kaa aadha bhaag hi lod main bheja jaataa he jabaki baaki aadha hissaa lod main jane se roak diya jaataa he
 It is used only for very low power output, not for much power
 kyonki yah bahut kam dakshata se vidyut-shakti kaa hastaantaran karata he
 Half-wave rectifiers in a phase circuit can be made using only one diode
 
 It takes three diodes for a three-phase supply
 voltage regulation = acha Average voltage = v max / pie ausat dhara = ai maiks / pai RMS voltage or effective voltage = v max / 2 aaremes dhara yaa prabhavi dhara = ai maximum / 2 Efficiency = 40
 6% ripal factor yaa urmika gunank = 1
2 1% Form factor or shape coefficient or metaphor * = 1
57 Peak factor = 2 TUF = 0
286 PIV = Vmax Output frequency = f_in is tarah kaa dishtakaari input asi ke dono bhaagon ko lod main bhejtaa he or lod main ek hi disha main dhara sunishchit karata he
 It is clear that it is more efficient than half-wave rectifier
 ek-phej paripathon main do tarah ke purna-tarang dishtakaari prayog kiye jate hai: Center-tap rectifier requires only two diodes, but this requires a center-tap transformer
 During the positive cycle of center tap / midpoint rectifier-supply, diode D1 becomes forward bias and behaves like a closed key
 This diode D2 sleeps reverse bye and behaves like an open key, diode D2 forward bias sleeps off key during the negative cycle of the supply In the meantime, diode D1 becomes reverse bias and behaves like an open key
 Average voltage = 2vmax / fhai average current = two imax / jab adhik shakti kaa disi kii aavashyak hoti he to ek-feji vidyut shakti ke bajaay teen-feji asi ko ractifi karnaa adhik upyukt rahata he
 It takes 6-diodes
 udhaaharan ke liye aajkal ke automobiles main 3-feji alternetr ke saath 3-feji brij dishtakaari laga hota he jo bydaree ko charge karne ke liye disi banaata he

 rujukari, input asi ko bahut adhik aavriti par band-chaalu karke disi banaate hai
 This causes the ripple frequency in the output DC to be very high and the current taken from the input AC is also almost sine-shaped
 aajkal adhik aavriti par band-chaalu kiye ja sakane vaale mossphate or aijibiti aadi swichon kii sulabhta ke kaaran is prakaar ke rujukari upyog main aane lage hai
 The output of the ripple in which the frequency of ripple is high, the value of l and c required to filter it will be less
 isi liye adhik shakti kii disi banane ke liye 12-pulse, 24-pulse yaa 48-pulse ke rujukari upyog main laaye jate hai
 The charger is a very useful power converter
 iske kuch upyog nimnlikhit hai- Before the introduction of semiconductor technology, vacuum tube diodes, mercury-arc-valves, copper-oxide or selenic-stack rectifiers were used to make decorators

 He was crowned by a descendant of Guru Nanak
 unhone lahore ko apni rajdhani banaaya or san 1802 main amritsar kii ore ruukh kiya
 Maharaja Ranjit fought many battles against the Afghans and drove them towards West Punjab
 ab peshawar samet pashtun kshetra par unheen kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 This was the first time Pashtuns were ruled by a non-muslim
 uske baad unhone peshawar, jammu kashmir or anandpur par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 He is also credited with forming the first modern Indian Army - the "sikh Khalsa Army"
 unki saraparasti main punjab ab bahut shaktishaalee suba tha
 This powerful army kept Britain from grabbing Punjab for a long time
 ek aisa mauka bhi aayaa jab punjab hi ekmaatr aisa suba tha, jis par angrejon kaa kabja nahin tha
 According to British historian JT Wheeler, if he had been a generation older, he would have conquered the whole of India
 maharaja ranjit khud anpadh the, lekin unhone apane rajya main shiksha or kala ko bahut protsaahan diya
 He established law and order in Punjab and never gave death penalty to anyone
 unka suba dharmanirpeksh tha unhone hinduon or sikhon se vasule jane vaale jajia par bhi roak lagaai
 Never forced anyone to adopt Sikhism
 unhone amritsar ke harimandir sahib gurudware main sangemarmar lagavaaya or sona madhvaaya, tabhi se use swarna mandir kaha jane laga

 Gradually, from the Sutlej to the Indus, he controlled all the Muslims who were ruling
 satluj or yamuna ke bich phulakiyon misl ke shaasha rajya kar rahe the
 In 1806 AD, Ranjitsingh also tried to subdue them, but was not successful

 He was a visionary

 One of his eyes was lost due to Sheetla's wrath

 So as long as he was alive, all the missiles were buried
 us samay angrejon kaa rajya yamuna tak pahunch gaya tha or phulakiyaan misl ke raja angreji rajya ke prabhutv ko maanane lage the
 The British forbade Ranjitsingh from doing this
 ranjitsingh ne angrejon se ladanaa uchit na samajha or sandhi kar lee ki satluj ke aage ham apana rajya na badhayenge
 Ranjitsingh summoned the French troops, prepared his army in a military manner, in his military command
 ab unne punjab ke dakshini, pashchimi or uttari bhaagon par akraman karnaa prarambh kiya or das varsh main multan, peshawar or kashmir tak apane rajya ko badha liya
 Ranjitsinh had captured Peshawar in his possession, but he had to fight hard for many years to take full authority over that province
 vah puure punjab kaa swami ban chukaa; or use angrejon ke hastkshep kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 But at the time when the British asked for help from the Sikhs against the Napoleonic forces, they did not receive it
 ranjitsingh ne san 1808 i
 main apni mahatvakankshini saas sadakor ke naam peshawar kaa rajya parivartit kar diya tha
 Because it was a British agent woman
 ranjitsingh ne apni kuchakrapriy saas se jhagada karke use kaid kar liya tha or hvadani ke garh ko apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 a contingent of the British army rescued the captive widow Sadakaur and recovered the authority
 british sena ke saath ranjitsingh kisi prakaar kaa jhagada nahin chaahate the
 The British could be accused of breaching the terms of the treaty
 isliye chupchaap maun rahakar usne taiyaariyaan prarambh kii thim phir bhi 1809 i
 main lard minto se sandhi kar lee
 However, this treaty caused the Maharaja to be greatly humiliated among the Sikhs

 Fearing Ranjitsingh's authority over Peshawar in 1838, Dost Mohammad Khan Kabulnaresh became very frightened and befriended Russia and Iran

 Punjab was ruled by Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 us samay maharaja ranjit singh ne kashmir ke soobedaar atamohammad ke shikanje se kashmir ko mukt karaane kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya tha

 Therefore, upon coming to Suyog, Maharaja Ranjit Singh liberated Kashmir
 unke dewan mohakamchand ne shergarh ke kile ko gher kar vafa begum ke pati shahshuja ko reeha kar vafa begum ke paas lahore pahunchaa diya
 Rajkumar Kharagsingh accommodated them in Mubarak Haveli
 par vafa begum apane vaade ke anusaar kohinoor hira maharaja ranjit singh ko bhent karne main vilamb karti rahi
 Even several months passed
 jab maharaja ne shahshuja se kohinoor heere ke bare main poocha to vah or uski begum donon hi bahaane banane lage
 When more emphasis was given, he handed over a fake diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, which proved to be a fake test of jewelers
 ranjit singh krodh se bhar uthe or mubarak haveli gher lee gai
 Food was not served there for two days

 Hence, he pledged to put Shahshuja on the throne of Kabul by placing his hand on "gurugranth Sahib"
 phir use "pagadi-badal bhai" banane ke liye usase pagadi badal kar kohinoor praapt kar liya
 Wafa Begum, sitting in the curtain of the curtain, understood the prudence of the Maharaja
 ab kohinoor maharaja ranjit singh ke paas pahunch gaya tha or ve santusht the ki unhone kashmir ko aaazaad kara liya tha
 He wished to offer the Kohinoor diamond to the iconic Lord Jagannath in the temple of Jagannathpuri

 He also offered immense gold at the Vishwanath temple in Kashi

 Corrosion of metals is a chemical action, which results in the decay and degradation of metals

 Corrosion in metals is actually in the form of chemical action, or electrocatalytic action

 In the electrocatalytic action of corrosion, suitable conditions are generated when metals are submerged in a fluid
 is prakaar sanksharan kriya main dhaatuon kaa vidyutracinic hraas hota he
 Corrosion of metals due to being submerged in them and liquids does not depend only on the above mentioned conditions, other factors also have a special and significant effect

 For example, keeping the copper strip in an open state for many years in an interstitial environment, germs a layer of alkali sulfate on the top floor of the plate

 Similarly, when iron or steel platen is completely submerged in saline water, a hard layer of hydrated iron oxide accumulates on its floor in the rain
 jalyojit ferick oxide prakruti main paae janevaale khanij gothit jaisaa hota he
 Thus, corrosion of metals is the action of alternation of metals in the intermediate metallic state to permanent oxidized state
 jo dhaatuen prakruti main apane shuddh rup main pai jaati hai, jaise swarna, unamem saamanyat: prakruti main upasthit karkon dwaara sanksharan kriya nahin hoti or iske falswaroop hi aisi dhaatuen asamyukt avasthaa main pai jaati hai
 On a structural basis, corrosion action affects metals in the following different forms: dhaatuon ke sanksharan nivaaran main saidhantik rup main un sabhi upayon evam karkon ko chhod dena padataa he jo sthaayee avasthaa ke prayaavartan ko protsaahit karte hai
 Such factors vary for different metals, but in general, oxygen and oxygen mixed solutions and soluble substances in water encourage the alternation of a permanent state
 sanksharan ke nivaaran main uparyukt karkon kaa purna bahishkaar praaia: asambhav hota he
 Therefore, in their presence self-sustaining actions are resorted to
 dhaatusanksharan kii vishesh paristhitiyon main sanksharan kii gati par adhiktam avrodh utpann karanevaale kaarak ko sanksharan kaa niyantrak kaarak kaha jaataa he
 Industrially important, almost all of the metal is exposed to the outer surface of the atmosphere by forming a visible, or non-visible, microscopic layer that affects subsequent corrosion processes
 saamanyat: yah parat khuli dhaatu ke oxide se nirmit hoti he
 Its properties are different from those of the parent metal, and the behavior of open conditions also leads to behavioral differences
 adhikansh paristhitiyon main oxide kii yah parat muldhatu ke sanksharan kaa nivaaran karti he
 When this type of thick layer breaks from somewhere due to transmission and contraction, then electro-chemical-corrosion starts at these places
 dhaatuon ke sanksharan ko nimnaankit chah bhaagon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he : Each of the above conditions has a characteristic in the corrosion process and different measures are taken to prevent it
 dhaatuon ke sanksharan nivaaran main vibhinn ritiyon kaa upyog hota he, jinamein nimnaankit pramukh hai : The ultimate method of corrosion prevention is most commonly used
 is reeti main dhaatu ke svachh bahya tal par oxide jaise prakritik nivarak adhilep kaa sambalan athwa uske sadrush prabhavotpadak kritrim adhilep padaarth kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this method of prevention by overlap, colorlap and other similar coatings are used, in which basic substances such as alkali chromate, lithharge, blood sis, red iron oxide, graphite, vituminite etc
 are prominent
 sanksharan nivaaran main galvanikaran, dhatukaneekaran, cement karan, vidyut nikshipt adhilep tathaa anya dhaatu adhilep kaa adhikadhik upyog hone laga he

 Its creators are believed to be the sages of the Vedic period but mainly Vedavas ji is considered the author of many Upanishads
 upanishdon ke rachanakaal ke sambandh main vidwaanon kaa ek mat nahin he
 Some Upanishads have been considered as part of the original codes of the Vedas
 ye sarvaadhik pracheen hai
 Some Upanishads are considered portions of 'brahman' and 'aranyak' texts
 inkaa rachanakaal samhitaon ke baad kaa he
 There is no definite opinion about the period of the Upanishads, the period of the general Upanishads is believed to have been composed from 3000 BC to 500 BC upanishdon ke kaal-nirnay ke liye nimna mukhya tathyon ko aadhaar mana gaya he— The composition of the various Upanishads has been considered by the following scholars in the following order: 16veen shatabdi ke prarambh main samast pashchimi europe dharmik drushti se ek tha - sabhi isai the; sabhi roman katholic carch ke sadsy the; uski parampargat shiksha maanate the or dharmik maamalon main uske adhyaksh arthath rome ke pope kaa shashan sweekaar karte the
 European reforms or reforms refer to the great movement of the 16th century, which resulted in this unity of Western Christians being disintegrated and Protestant religion emerged
 carch ke itihas main samay-samay par sudhaarwadi andolan hote rahe kintu ve carch ke dharmik siddhaton athwa uske shaskaon ko chunauti na dekar unke nirdesh ke anusaar hi naitik buraaiyon kaa unmoolan tathaa dharmik shiksha kaa prachaar apana uddeshy maanate the
 The reform movement that began in the 16th century soon began to oppose both the traditional teaching of the Church and the authority of its rulers
 dharmasudhar andolan ke parinamswaroop europe main catholic sampradaay ke saath-saath luther sampradaay, calvin sampradaay, anglican sampradaay or presbyterian sampradaay prachlit ho gayi
 To understand this new form of reform, it is very important to consider the present situation in Europe
 isa dwaara pravartit katholic carch ke prati isaayiyon main jo shraddha kaa bhav shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa tha vah kai kaarnon se kam ho gaya tha
 In the 14th century, a French pope was elected, who remained in France throughout his life
 iske falswaroop baad main 40 varsh tak do pope vidyaman the, ek france main or ek rome main, jisase samast katholic sansar do bhaagon main vibhakt rahaa
 In the eighth century, the Catholic king of the Franks defeated the Lavard army invading Italy and gave the central part of Italy under the authority of the Pope, and thus became an ordinary ruler in addition to the cleric of the Roman Catholic Church
 is kaaran germany or france ke raja sahaj hi carch ke maamalon main or visheshkar pope ke chunaav main hastkshep karne kaa prayaas karte rahe
 In the late 14th century, this election became a competition ground for Italian elites, focusing less on the individual's merit and more on his lineage
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki us samay nitant ayogy popon kaa chunaav hua or rome ke darbar main naitikta tathaa dharm kii upeksha hone lagi
 So it was quite natural for the Church of Rome to lose respect
 asantosh kaa ek or kaaran yah tha ki samast carch kii sansthaaon par unki sampatti ke anusaar kar lagaaya jaataa tha or rome ke pratinidhi sarvada ghumkar yah rupaya vasuul karte the
 Apart from this predicament of the central organization of the Church, the condition of various religions was not satisfactory
 is samay samast pashchimi europe lagbhag saat sau dharmapraanton main vibhakt tha
 Their rulers were called bishops
 ye bishap samant the jo raja dwaara praaia: abhijaat varg main se chune jate the, darbar ke sadsy the or germany main bahudhaa apane kshetra ke raajnneetik shaasha bhi the
 Therefore, many bishops were more interested in politics, less interested in religion and left the religious administration of their homeland to the highly empowered priests of the university
 gaanvon main basanevaale adhikansh saadhaaran purohit ardhashikshit the
 They were unable to give lectures and were often poor
 saadhaaran purohiton kii yah dayaneey dasha 16veen shatabdi ke europea katholic carch kii sab se badi kamajori thi
 There was no one to teach religious education to the general public except the visiting Franciscans etc
 isse sarvatra andhvishwaas fail gaya or karmkand ko anaavashyak evam asantulit mahatv diy jane laga
 In the 13th century, Catholic theology gave a rational representation of the doctrines through the Christian interpretation of Aristotle and the Scholastic Philosophy, but in the 15th century the focus and contemplation of the fundamental problems of religion were removed
 vishvavidhyalayon main dharmapandit gaun prashnon ke vishay main apane matbhedon ko adhik mahatv dene lage the jisase katholic dharmavigyaan itan nishpraan ho gaya tha ki kuch saadhakon kii yah dharna drudh ho gai thi ki dharmavigyaan sadhana main baadhak he
 Thus we see that there was a need for reform in all the areas of the church and the movement for reforms became imperative
 14veen shatabdi main angarej vicliff or baad main bohemia ke na hus jo sikhalaane lage the ki carch kaa sanghathan, uske sanskaar aadi yah sab manushyon kaa avishkaar he; isaayiyon ke liye bible hi paryaapt he
 Even at that time those ideas did not get much success, but their influence on Luther is obvious
 spain main tolido ke arbobishap cemeness ne carch ke anushaasan ke andar dharmasudhar andolan pravartit kiya jisase vahaan kaa vaataavaran purna rup main badal gaya kintu pashchimi europe main carch kii paristhiti main koi vishesh parivartan nahin ho paaya tha
 When Luther raised his voice against Rome, he had unprecedented success for another reason
 europe main us samay sarvatra pracheen unani tath latin sahitya kii lokapriyata ke saath saath ek naveen saanskrithik andolan prarambh hua jise rinesaan athwa navajagaran kaha gaya he
 As a result, a sense of personal freedom arose in the people
 mudran ke avishkaar ke kaaran isi samay se bible kii mudrit pratiyaan adhik saraltapurvak sulabh hone lagi thim, jisase logon ko apni ore se dharm ke vishay main sochane or bible ko apni nijee vyakhya karne kii pravriti ko bhi protsaahan milane laga tha
 The historical development of the European Reformation is as follows: It began with Luther's rebellion in 1517 AD
 unhone kin paristhitiyon main apana andolan pravartit kiya tha or carch ke kin paramparaagat siddhanto kaa virodh karke kis prakaar ek nayaa dharm chalaaya tha, iskaa varnan vishwakosh main anyatra kiya gaya he 
 At that time all of Germany was divided into about four hundred independent states
 unke adhikansh shaskaon ne katholic samrat charles ke virodh main luther ko sarankshan pradaan kiya or apni praja ko luther ke carch main mila diya
 Soon all the Scandinavian Christians also joined the Lutheran religion
 switsraland main dharmasudhar ke do netaa sarvapradhan the - jurik main jinvagli or janeeva main calovin, donon ke anuyaayi baad main ek hi kelvinist carch main sammilit ho gaye
 The sect also spread to Holland, Scotland and parts of France
 scotland main iskaa naam presbytareey dharm rakhaa gaya he france main pehle luther kaa prabhaav padaa kintu baad main vahaan ke adhikansh protestat dharmavalambee, jo yugani kehalaate hai, calovin ke anuyaayi ban gaye
 His organization was active for a long time as a political party
 england ke raja ne prarambh hi se luther kaa virodh kiya tha
 He also wrote a treatise in which he gave the pope's divine right to matters of religion
 yadhyapi henry jivan bhar apane rajya main protestant siddhanton kaa prachaar rokane kaa prayaas karte rahe, phir bhi unhone vyaktigat kaarnon se 1531 i
 main england kaa carch rome se alag kar diya, is prakaar anglican samudaay prarambh hua tha
 The Protestant ideology had a profound influence on the church during the time of Henry's successors, which is now considered one of the three major branches of Protestant religion, but the Anglican community in fact has its own distinct history of origin, development and propagation
 in teen sampradaayon ke atirikt dharmasudhar andolan ke falswaroop protestant dharm ke or bahut se upsampradaayon kaa udbhav hua jinka yahan par ullekh karnaa anaavashyak he
 Some details of the sects which are of relatively more importance are given elsewhere in the dictionary
 is simhavlokan se spasht ho jaataa he ki luther dwaara pravartit sudhaar andolan ne vibhinn rup dhaaran kar samast europe ko hilaa diya
 Initially the reform of the church was the aim of this movement, but it soon began to attack the traditional education of the church and the organizational unity of the church
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki europe ke isaisansar kii ekta shatabdiyon ke liye chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Completely independent sects emerged from the point of view of governance, which, while believing the same Jesus and the Bible, give different opinions about many fundamental religious principles
 raajnneetik drushti se dharmasudhar kaa parinaam bahut hi vyapak rahaa
 The later condition of Europe was such that the rulers too inevitably took an active part in this religious movement
 ve apni praja ko apane hi dharm main sammilit karne athwa banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 Thus many wars in the name of religion are discussed in the history of Europe, such as the 30-year war in Germany, the Yugno War in France and the successful freedom struggle against Emperor Charles v in Holland
 upar iskaa ullekh ho chukaa he ki katholic carch main samay samay par sudhaar andolanon kaa pravarttan hota rahaa he kintu 16veen shatabdi ke vidrohatmak dharmasudhar se katholic carch ko vishesh rup se prerana mili
 This century saw the election of talented individuals as pope who have again given priority to spirituality under the rule of the Church, which again led to the reappearance of the pope in the entire Catholic world
 bishpon kii samantshahi ko samaapt kar diya gaya or chaaron or sadhuswabhaav vyaktiyon kii niyukti se janata ke saamne bishap kaa pracheen adarsh ubharne laga, jo apni praja kaa dharmaguru evam aadhyatmik charvaaha he
 The 19th World Assembly of the Church was organized in the city of Trent, in addition to the new organization of the Church, in particular the teaching of ordinary priests was arranged
 at: carch kii sabhi shreniyon main sudhaar hua or jansadharan main dharmik shiksha kaa uchit prachaar ho sakaa
 In this work, religious leaders have shared the hands of other priests
 16veen shatabdi main jesuit aadi kai dharmasanghon kii sthapana hui tathaa pracheen dharmasanghon main sudhaar laayaa gaya jisase ve sabake sab samay kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar dharm kii seva kar saken
 In this way, we see that perhaps the most profound and beneficial effect of the Reformation was on the old Catholic Church
 europea dharmasudhar kaa vyapak prasar evam gaharaa prabhaav dekhakar anayas hi man main yah prashn uthta he ki is apurv safalataa kaa kya rahasy he
 Several reasons for this success have been conceived: 15veen shatabdi ke aarambh main katholic carch kii dayaneey dasha or iske karnadhaaron kii niskriyata, carch kii sampati hadapney ko utsuk rajanetaaon kii sahaayta, navajagaran ke kaaran vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa andolan, mudran ke avishkaar se prachaar kii nai suvidhaayen
 All this proved to be helpful for the under-reported movement, but the secret of its success must be found elsewhere
 dharmasudhar ke pravartak satvik or dharmik bhav se prerit the or ve apane pratibhashali sahyogiyon main bhi dharmik navajagaran kii utkar abhilaashaa utpann karne main samarth hue
 In his view, the only remedy for that renaissance seemed to be that man would not surrender to Jesus by believing in his virtuous deeds, and believe in the Bible's gospel of Jesus safely
 unhone bible ko apane andolan kaa aadhaar bana liya, bible main jo shakti nihit he usee ke dwaara unhen safalataa mili he
 Nowadays 16th century events are being considered in the Christian world in neutral terms
 kathilak europea dharmasudhar kii rachanaatmak uplabdhiyon ko sweekaar karte hai or protetianst samajhane lage hai ki carch kii tatkaaleen buraaiyon kaa virodh karnaa kitna hi aavashyak kyon na tha, uski ekta chhin bhinn karne se isai dharm ko bahut haani hui he
 After the Second World War, the movement for Christian unity has been given utmost importance and the desire to remove the ill effects of the reforms is increasing
 martin luther ke purv dharmasudharkon ne chaudaavin sadi se hi carch or popashahi kii aniatikta, bhrashtataa, vilasita or shoshan ke viruddh apni aawaaj buland kii or unhone dharm sudhaar kii prishth bhoomi taiyaar kii

 CM The Chausat Yogini Temple of Morena is an ancient temple located in the district of Morena in Madhya Pradesh called Mitavali
 yah bharat ke un chausath yogini mandiron main se ek he jo abhi bhi acchhee dasha main bache hai
 The temple is built on a circular basis and has 64 chambers
 madhya main ek khulaa hua mandap he
 This temple was built in 1323 AD
 aisa mana jaataa he ki bharat kaa sansad bhawan, isi style par nirmit he
 The Archaeological Survey of India has declared this temple as an ancient historical monument

 The internal combustion engine is an engine in which fuel and oxidizer are ignited in a cylindrical combustion chamber closed on all sides
 dahan kii is kriya main praayah hawa hi oxykaarak kaa kaam karti he
 The closed chamber in which combustion takes place is called combustion chamber
 dahan kii yah abhikriya ooshmakshepi hoti he jo ucch taap evam daab vaali gaisen utpann karti he
 These gases circulate by pushing a piston in the combustion chamber
 piston ek connecting rod ke madhyam se ek krank shaft se judaa hota he, is prakaar jab piston neeche kii taraf jaataa he to connecting rod se judi krank shaft ghumne lagati he, is prakaar eendhan kii rasinic urja pehle ooshmiya urja main badalati he or phir ooshmiya urja yantric urja main badal jaati he
 Unlike the internal combustion engine, the working fluid in the exhaust engine is obtained by heating a liquid in another chamber
 praayah pistonyukt pratyaagaamee ingine, jisamen kuch-kuch samyaanterval ke baad dahan hota he, ko hi anterdahan ingine kaha jaataa he kintu jet ingine, adhikansh rocket evam anek gas terbine bhi anterdahan ingine kii shrenee main aati hai jinamein dahan kii kriya anwarat rup se chalati rahati he
 Nowadays most of the engines used in automobiles are internal engines
 antardahan ingine ke avishkaar kaa vichaar madhyayug se prarambh hua
 In 1680, the Dutch scientist Christian Hyges suggested a vertical cylinder and piston engine, in which a piston shot upwards by a gunpowder explosion
 kintu is tarah kaa ingine kabhi kaam main nahin aayaa
 Later, with the invention of combustible gases and mineral oils, his suggestion became practical as the problem of giving fuel instead of gunpowder was solved
 lekin phir bhi is varg ke injanon ko vyaavhaarik upyogita ke anukool banane main anek varsho ke praayegic or saidhantik adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa hui
 Diesel, petrol, alcohol or natural or synthetic gas etc
 are used as fuel in internal combustion engines
 lekin saadhaarant: petrol or dijal kaa hi upyog hota he
 Impedance engines operate on two principles - quadrant cycle and quadratic cycle four stroke ingine main chaaron stroke sakson,compresson,power va agzast kii prakiya purna hoti he
 And power when the piston is up and down twice
 matlab krenkashaft do baar gumti he
 Fuel is saved in the four stroke engine
 antardahan injanon main do jatiyaan hoti hai, ekadish sakriy ingine or ubhaydish sakriy ingine
 In active engines, the working material rests on only one side of the piston; On both sides in amphibious active engines
 unamem silinder lanbaa rahata he or piston ke donon ke bhaagon main chushan, sampeden ityadi hota rahata he
 Most internal engines are activated directly
 udhaahrant:, motorkaron main ingine isi prakaar ke hote hai
 But many large engines are enabled amphibiously
 ekadish sakriy ingine kii apeksha ubhaydish sakriy ingine main lagbhag duguni urja utpann hoti he or naap main nammaatr hi vruddhi hoti parantu ubhaydish sakriy injanon ke nirmaan main kai yantric kathinaaiyaan padati hai
 Therefore, only large boat engines have amphibious active engines
 duusari ore, vaashp ingine or vaayu sampidak saadhaarant: ubhaydish sakriy banaae jate hai, yadhyapi yah anivaary niyam nahin he
 Most of today's combustion engines are built on the principle of Otto cycle
 gananaa kii saralata ke liye ham kalpana kar sakate hai ki chakra main do kriyaayein samentropic or do sthiraayatnik hoti hai
 In order to facilitate the analysis of hypothetical cycles, it is assumed that the working substance is air only
 yah bhi maan liya jaataa he ki na to chushan aghat hota he ore na nikaas aghat
 This analysis is called aerodynamic analysis
 vaastavik ingine main gaison kaa nikaas hota he
 Instead, gases are thought to cool at a constant volume
 kaary utana hi hota he, chaahe gaison kaa nikaas kiya jaae, chaahe unhen thanda kiya jaae prayek dasha main idhan ke jalane se utpann ushma utani hi rahati he
 The rate at which energy is converted into work is called power; This is the amount of work in a unit of time
 vah kaary jo aage peeche chalanevaale piston yukt ingine ke piston par kiya jaataa he, nirdisht karm kehalaata he or nirdisht kaary ke anusaar gananaa kii hui shakti nirdisht ashwashakti kehalaati he
 The amount of work that reaches the engine axis is called axle work or brake work and the power generated according to this work is called brake horsepower
 kisi antardahan ingine ke kitna shakti praapt ho sakati he, ise nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai aadhaar liye ja sakate hai
 Motorcar engine makers in their advertisements state the maximum power of their engine, which is achieved when all conditions are optimally suited
 parantu audyogic ingine kaa nirmaataa apane injanon kii shakti saadhaarant: lagbhag mahattam ushmiya dakshata par utpann honevaali shakti ke anusaar nirdhaarit karte hai
 It is also best to determine the power of industrial engines in this way
 kaaran yah he ki yadi ingine nirdhaarit samarthy par chalaae jaayenge to eendhan kaa kharch nunatam hoga or phir aavashyaktaa hone par kuch samay tak ve adhik samarthy par bhi kaam kar sakenge
 The power received in each internal combustion engine depends on the mass of the fuel-air mixture that enters the cylinder in one run of the piston
 isliye jin kaarnon se yah dravyaman ghatega unase ingine kaa samarthy ghatega
