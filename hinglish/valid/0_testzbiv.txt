 In 1967, Arnone reported that the protein found in the chloroplast had a major function in photosynthesis
 aadhunik yug main sabhi vaigyanikon dwaara yah maanya he ki prakaash sanshleshan main swatantra oxygen pani se aati he
 On the basis of many experiments in modern times, it has been proved that the process of photosynthesis takes place in the following two stages
 pehle charan main prakaash prakriya athwa hill prakriya athwa photochemical prakriya
 And in the second stage the dark process or the Blackman process or the lightless process
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main donon prakriyaayen ek duusare ke pashchaat hoti he
 The light process ignores the dark process more quickly
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya paudhe ke sabhi chloroplast yukt koshikaon main hoti he
 That means all the green parts of the plant
 yah kriya visheshtah pattiyon ke mesophil utak main hoti he kyonki pattiyon ke mesophil utak kii perenima koshikaon main anya koshikaon kii upeksha chloroplast kii maatra adhik hoti he
 The process of photosynthesis that takes place in the presence of light is studied under light action
 is kriya ko hill aadi anya vaigyanikon dwaara adhyayan kiya gaya
 Dark processes act as a limiting factor when lighting processes
 prakaash prakriyaayen do charnon main hoti hai, photolysis evam hydrogen kaa sthaapan
 In the process of photolysis, light is absorbed as a photon by a molecule of chlorophyll
 jab chlorophyl kaa anu ek kwantem prakaash shoshit kar letaa he uske pashchaat chlorophyl kaa doosraa anu tab tak prakaash shoshit nahin karata he jab tak ki pehali urja prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main prayog nahin ho jaati he
 Photons of light thus absorbed by chlorophyll ejects an electron at high energy levels and this power is located on the third bond of phosphate and appears as high-energy adenosine triphosphate
 is prakaar chloropil prakaash kii upasthiti main atipi utpann karte hai tathaa is prakriya ko phosphorailation kehete hai
 In this way, the energy of sunlight is converted into ATP, ie chemical energy
 is prakaar chlorophyl anu main nirmit atipi chlorophyl anu se pruthak hokar CO2 ko sharkara main anoksikrut hone aadi anek rasinic kriyaaon main sahaayak he
 Chlorophyll becomes inert again upon freeing this ATP
 vaan nil frank, vishanik ke anusaar pani jab is kriyasheel chlorophyl ke sampark main aate hai tab pani anoksikrut h tathaa tej oxykaarak OH main vichchhedit ho jaataa he
 Chlorophyll + Light → Activated Chlorophyll H2O + Activated Chlorophyll → h + + OH- In this photolysis process O2 is liberated from water and hydrogen also moves to the hydrogen subscriber
 2H2O + 2A → 2AH2 + O2 is prakaar paudhon kii prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriyaayon se nikali samast oxygen jal se praapt hoti hai
 Hill, Reuben supported it and proved it using O18
 pani se oxygen nikalne ko chlorilla naamak shaiwal main CO2 kii anupasthiti main dikhaaya gaya
 This means that oxygen can be produced in the absence of CO2, but it must have hydrogen content
 aisa dekha gaya he ki paudhon main enedipi do NADPH2 banaata he
 2H2O + 2NADP = 2NADPH2 + O2 aranan ke matanusaar prakaash kriya mukhya rup se nirmaan se sambandhit he
 NADPH2 / NADP is formed by degradation
 NADP ko TPN bhi kehete hai
 ATP is a light energy molecule formed by the joining of a phosphate group in ADP and this action is called phosphorylation
 edipi ke phosforilation main prakaash urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he atah ise photo-phosforilation bhi kehete hai
 It is also a complex process and according to Aranan the lighting process takes place in two processes
 ayugma photo-phosforilation tathaa yugma photo-phosforileshvyugma photo-phosforilation main pani ke apghaton ke kaaran electron nirantar praapt hote he tathaa photo-phosforilation kii kriya par chlorophyl main prakaash urja se atipi kaa nirmaan hota rahata he
 Thus upon activation of chlorophyll 'a', ferredoxin acts as an electron receptor to give a coenzyme called NADP in which NAD is converted to NADPH2 by capturing hydrogen released by water
 is prakaar pani main vighatan main hue mukt electron chlorophyl ‘b’ ko uttejit kar ucch urja str par pahoonch jate hai tathaa ye electron phir kas prakaar chlorophyl ‘a’ ko praapt hote hai, purna rup se gyaat nahin he lekin aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki plastokavinon naamak electron grahi in electronon ko pakad letaa he jo cytochrome dwaara punah chlorophyl ‘a’ main pahunch jate hai
 It also produces ATP simultaneously
 yugma photo-phosforilation kii kriya main surya ke prakaash se chlorophyl ‘a’ sakriy hokar electron ko baahar kii ore phankta he jo chlorophyl main upasthit ferydoxin dwaara pakad liye jate hai
 This electron is liberated and is captured by an electron receptor called plastoquinone
 is kriya ke madhya main edipi, atipi main parivartit ho jaataa he tathaa electron punah mukt hokar cytochrome vikar se hokar chlorophyl ‘a’ main vaapis pahunch jaataa he
 In this action also, ADP is converted into ATP
 is kriya main bahari electron prayog nahin hota tathaa chlorophyl se electron nikalakar punah vahiin vaapis aa jaataa he
 In this way water is decomposed by paired and combustion processes, which liberates oxygen gas and is captured by hydrogen, hydrogen receptor NADP as well as energy classified which is used in chemical process or unpublished reaction
 
 oxigen tathaa prakaash-sanshleshan This process does not require light
 is prakriya main praayah carbondioxide kaa avkaran hota he
 In this process, the carbon dioxide absorbed by the stomata of the leaf, due to the energy of hydrogen light released from the water, forms a permanent liquid
 CH2O, yah ek carbohydrates kii ikai anu he
 Calvin and Banson reported using radioisotropic techniques that the first permanent compound in the photosynthesis process was a 3-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acid
 chlorolla evam sindesmas naamak shaiwalon main radio active C14O2 kii upasthiti main kuch samay ke liye prakaash-sanshleshan karaayaa gaya tathaa inamen bhi pehla sthai dravya phosphoglicerick amla bana
 This phosphoglyceric acid subsequently forms glucose
 is prakaar kelvin tathaa uske sahakarmiyon ke kaaryon se yah siddh ho gaya ki prakaash-sanshleshan prakriya main CO2 glucose main parivartit ho jaati he
 He used isotopes of carbon in this experiment
 chlorophyl main ribuloj-1,5 visphosphate upasthit rahata he
 Now atmospheric CO2 penetrates through the leaf stomata and enters immediately, forming a temporary compound with ribulose-1,5 visphosphate
 is prakaar bana asthai yogic jo 5-carbon sugar he sheeghra hi phosphoglaicerick acid ke 2 anuon main tut jaataa he
 Now here, when hydrogen is released by NADPH2, it converts PGA to PGAL
 is kriya main urja atipi se praapt hoti he
 In this way CO2 creates carbohydrates
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii andheri prakriya main jin paudhon main pehla sthai yogic phosphoglissrik amla banataa he unhen C3 paudha kehete hai
 Phosphoglyceric acid is a 3-carbon additive, hence these plants are named so
 jin paudhon main pehla sthai yogic 4 carbon vaala yogic banataa he unako C4 paudha kehete hai
 The compound with 4 carbons is usually oxaloacetic acid
 pehle aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki prakaash-sanshleshan main carbondioxide ke sthirikaran yaa yogikeekaran ke samay keval C3 yaa kelvin chakra hi hota tha arthath pehla sthai yogic phosphoglissrik amla hi banataa he
 But in 1966 Hatch and Slack pointed out that there is also a second path for the stabilization of carbon dioxide
 unhone ganna, makka, ameranthus aadi paudhon main adhyayan kar bataaya ki phosphoinol piruvik amla jo ki 3 carbon visisth yogic he carbondioxide se sanyukt hokar 4 carbon visisth yogic oxaloecetic amla banaata he
 In this activity, phosphoinol acts as a pyruvate carboxylase enzyme catalyst
 prakaash-sanshneshan kii kriya main chaar mukhya avyav hai, jal, carbondioxide, prakaash evam parn harim
 The presence of these four is very important for this action
 inamen se jal evam carbondioxide ko prakaash-sanshleshan kaa kaccha maal kehete hai kyonki inke rachanaatmak avyavon dwaara hi prakaash-sanshleshan ke mukhya utpaada carbohydrate kii rachana hoti he
 The plant takes these ingredients from the environment around them
 carbondioxide prakaash-sanshleshan kaa ek mukhya avyav tathaa kaccha padaarth he
 Carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere is released by the actions of respiration, combustion, fermentation, dissolution etc
 vaayu main isaki maatra 0
03 % se 0
04 % hoti he
 Terrestrial plants take it directly from the air
 in paudhon kii pattiyon main chote chhidr hote hai jinhe parnarandhra kehete hai
 Carbon dioxide enters the leaves of the plant from these same foliage
 jalmagn paudhe jal main ghuli carbondioxide ko apni shaareerik sataha se visaran dwaara grahan karte hai
 The sources of carbon dioxide in water are aquatic animals, whose gases are produced in respiration
 jal ke bheetar chattaanon main upasthit carbonate tathaa bicarbonate ke vighatan se bhi carbondioxide utpann hoti he jisko jaleey paudhe prakaash-sanshleshan main grahan karte hai
 Carbohydrates called glucose are formed in photosynthesis
 isamen carbon tathaa oxigen tatv ke parmaanu carbondioxide se hi praapt hote hai
 Chlorophyll Chlorophyll is a proteinated complex chemical compound
 yah prakaash-sanshleshan kaa mukhya varnak he
 There are two types of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b
 yah sabhi swaposhi hare paudhon ke chloroplast main paaya jaataa he
 Chlorophyll molecules absorb sunlight energy and convert it into chemical energy
 surya ke prakaashiya urja ko avashoshit karke chlorophyl kaa anu uttejit ho jate hai
 These active molecules decompose the water molecules into h + and oh-ions
 is prakaar chlorophyl ke anu prakaash-sanshleshan kii jaev-rasaynic kriya ko prarambh karte hai
 Light Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis
 balb aadi ke teevr kritrim prakaash main bhi prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya hoti he
 This activity is most common in red light
 laal ke baad begni rang ke prakaash main yah kriya sabase adhik hoti he
 Both these colors are absorbed by chlorophyll in the greatest amount
 hare rang ko chlorophyl puri tarah paravartit kar dete hai atah har rang ke prakaash main prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya puri tarah ruuk jaati he
 Water is the raw material for photosynthesis
 sthaliy paudhe ise mitti se jad ke mulromon dwaara avashoshit karte hai
 Aquatic plants absorb water from the outer surface of their water contact parts
 orchid jaise upararohi paudhe apane viviya mulon dwaara vayumandaleey jalawaashp ko grahan karte hai
 Oxygen is produced by the optical breakdown of water in the optical reaction of photosynthesis
 yahi oxigen upapadaarth ke rup main vaataavaran main mukt hota he
 The molecules of hydrogen are obtained from water in the glucose molecules formed in the half reaction
 prakaash-sanshleshan ke samay jal apratyaksh rup se bhi kai kaary karata he
 It maintains activity of organisms and activation of enzymes
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya anek karkon dwaara prabhavit hoti he
 Some of its factors are external and some are internal
 iske atirikt kuch seemaabaddh kaarak bhi hote hai
 External causes are those that affect photosynthesis while being located in nature and environment, such as light, since the plant receives energy for this activity from sunlight and this action is not possible from darkness
 carbondai oxide, kyon ki aisa dekha gaya he ki yadi anya sabhi kaarak paudhe ko ucchtam maatra main praapt hon tathaa vayumandal main CO2 kii maatra dhire-dhire badhaai jaye to prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar bhi bad jaati he
 Temperature, because it has been observed that a certain temperature is also required for photosynthesis in plants and water is very important for water photochemical processes and it supports many chemical changes during this process
 aantarik kaaran ve hote hai jo pattiyon main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai jaise- parnaharith yaa chlorophil jiske dwaara prakaash urja rasinic urja main parivartit hoti he
 Pruss / organism / protoplasm in which wickers are found affect the photosynthesis
 bhojya padaarth kaa jamaav, kyon ki prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main bana bhojan yadi sthaneey koshikaon main ekatrit hota rahe to prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar dhimi ho jaati he
 The internal structure of the leaves is because the rate of photosynthesis depends on the number of stomata or stomata present in the leaves and their closing and opening time
 pattiyon kii aayu, kyon ki nai pattiyon main puraani pattiyon kii apkshaa prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar adhik hoti he
 In addition, the photosynthesis also affects the different speeds of all these objects
 jab prakaash sanshleshan kii ek kriya vibhinn karkon dwaara niyantrit hoti he tab prakaash sanshleshan kii gati sabase mand kaarak dwaara niyantrit hoti he
 Whatever is less than the appropriate amount of light, carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll etc
, it controls the speed of the whole action
 yah kaarak samay vishesh ke liye seemaabaddh kaarak kaha jaataa he

 rani hippolita kii beti, dyna kaa bachapan ek chhipe hue dweep, themiskira par beetaa tha, jo zyoos dwaara nirmit maanav jati kii rakshak yoddha mahilaon kaa ghar tha
 Hippolyta told Diana once in childhood the history of the Amazon, how Zeus' son, Eris, became jealous of humanity and devised plans to destroy it
 jab anya devataaon ne use rokane kaa prayaas kiya, to aries ne ek yuddh main zyoos ko chhodkar anya sabhi devataaon ko maar daalaa; or phir ghayal zyoos ne apni bachi hui aakhri shakti kaa prayog kar aries ko waapas jane par majaboor kar diya, or is prakriya main vah veergati ko praapt ho gaye
 Before his death, Zeus built the island of Amazon to confront Eris's return in the future, and organized an army of women to provide him with a weapon called Godkiller
 yadhyapi hippolita prarambh main dyna ko astravidya or yudhniti main prashikshit karne ke viruddh thi, parantu dyna kii zid or uski bahan, antip ke samajhane par usne anichhaa main antip ko dyna ko prashikshan dene kii anumati de di

 dweep par jaldi hi ek german lite kruger ne akraman kar diya, jo trevor kaa peechha karata hua vahaan aa dhamka tha
 The Amazon warriors defeated and defeated the ship, but Antip sacrificed his life to save him from a bullet coming towards Diana

 Diana battles Ludendorff and kills her, but her death has no effect on the war, leaving her confused
 tabhi, sar patric vahaan aate he or dyna ko bataate hai ki vah hi vastav main aries hai
 Eris tells Diana that although she has interfered with humans' thoughts and motivations from time to time using pawns such as Ludendorff and Maru, humans ultimately decide to resort to violence, as they are inherently corrupt
 jab dyna "godciller" talwaar se aries ko maarane kaa prayaas karti he, to vah ise nasht kar detaa he, or phir khulaasa karata he ki "godciller" koi astr nahin, balki dyna swayan he, jo vastav main zyoos or hippolita kii putree he
 Eris requests Diana to help destroy mankind in order to make the Earth resemble heaven, which she rejects

 Steve hijacks a gas-filled bomber aircraft, and explodes to a safe altitude, destroying all the gas

 Taking advantage of this, Eris attempts to provoke Diana to kill Maru by claiming that Maru is responsible for Steve's death, but based on her experiences with Steve, Diana arrives at the decision that there is still goodness within humans
 vah maaru ko chhod detii he, or aries kii hi bijli kaa prayog kar use maar detii he

 However, Whidden did not complete the final version of his screenplay, and then in 2007 he left the project
 yadhyapi wheaden ne may 2005 main kaha tha ki vah script samaapt hone tak vander vuman ke liye kisi abhinetri ko nahin chunenge, lekin ket bekincel kuch samay baad film se jud gayi thi
 However in 2010, Whidden admitted she had an actress in mind for the role, when she stated that "wonder Woman was originally Angelina Jolie
" " kuch saal baad may 2017 main, indi ground films ne wheaden kii patakatha ek sanskaran online li kar diya
 In June 2017, people reacted negatively to the script on social media, shortly after the release of the film's version of Patty Jenkins
 jab jenkins se june 2017 main ek saakshaatkaar main is patakatha ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki unhone ise nahin padhaa he or wheaden "ab disi univers main hai, or mujhe nahin lagata ki vahaan jane kii koi zarurat he yah jaisaa tha, vaisaa tha
 i am lucky that i got to do it
 lekin mujhe nahin lagata ki unhone jo kiya hota, yaa maine jo kiya, in donon kii tulana karne main koi phayda he
 " vander vuman se wheaden ke prasthaan se ek din pehle, warner bros or silver pikchars ne mathew jenisan or brent stricland dwaara likhi gai film ke liye ek vishisht patakatha kharidi
 Set during World War II, the script impressed Silver Pictures executives
 haalanki, silver ne kaha ki unhone patakatha isliye kharidi he, kyonki vah adhikaron ko waapas nahin lenaa chaahate the; jabaki script ko achche vichaar the, lekin silver vaale nahin chaahate the ki vander vuman ek period film ho
 By April 2008, Silver hired Jenison and Strickland to write a new script set set in contemporary times that would be about the history of Paradise Island, not based on the origins of Wonder Woman
 november 2008 main, gayika bionse ne disi comics or warner bros ke pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat kar vander vuman kii bhoomika nibhaane main ruchi vyakt kii
 In 2010, Warner Bros
 confirmed that a film based on Wonder Woman was in development, along with DC Comics' other superheroes The Flash and Aquaman
 june 2013 tak ekal film ke liye vander vuman or equaman, donon par abhi bhi vichaar ho rahaa tha
 DC Chief Diane Nelson said that Wonder Woman ", ever since we started filmmaking, is one of the top three priorities for DC and Warner Bros
, and so we're still trying, but hard to mold her character
" is
 " 5 oktober 2013 ko, dablyubi chairman kevin tujihara ne kaha ki vah vander vuman par ek film yaa tivi kaarykram har haal main bananaa chaahate hai
 Soon after, Paul Feig stated that he had given the studio the idea to make an action-comedy film for Wonder Woman
 studio ne bhi turant film nirdeshit karne ke liye mahila nirdeshkon kii khoj shuru kar di
 Michelle mclaren was the studio's initial choice, and she also initially showed interest in the project, but eventually left the project due to creative differences
 2015 main pati jenkins ke saamne vander vuman ko nirdeshit karne kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya, jise unhone sweekaar kar liya
 This time the film's screenplay was to be written by Alan Heinberg, based on a story co-written by Heinberg, Zac Snyder, Geoff Jones and Jason Fuchs
 vander vuman ke is sanskaran ke bare main, gadt ne kaha ki, For a long time, people could not understand what to approach the story
 jab pati or mere bich is charitra kii rachana ke bare main baatcheet hui, to hamen ehsaas hua ki dyna ek saamaanya bhi mahila ho sakati he, jiske adarsh ucch hai, lekin phir bhi, he vah ek mahila hi
 She can be sensitive
 vah smart or swatantra or bhaavnaatmak he
 She can be confused
 vah apana aatmavishvaas kho sakati he
 Then you can get that confidence back
 vah kuch bhi ho sakati he
 He also has a human heart

 Jenkins credits the stories of the character's creator William Moulton Marston in the 1940s for the story's development, and the original stories of George Perez in the 1980s in which he modernized the character
 iske alaava, yah charitra disi comics ke da new 52 riboot main hue parivartan ke kuch pahaluon kaa bhi paalan karata he, jinke anusaar dyna ab zyoos kii beti he
 Jenkins cited Richard Donner's Superman as his inspiration

 Comparing and organizing instruments on the basis of their complexity is misleading, as developments in instruments have sometimes reduced complexity
 udhaaharan ke liye, praarambhik slit drum ke nirmaan main vishaal pedo kii kataai or unhen khokhla karnaa shaamil tha; baad main slit drum kaa nirmaan bans ke tane ko kholkar kiya jane laga, jo kaaphi aasaan tha
 Similarly, it is misleading to organize the development of instruments on the basis of workmanship, since all cultures develop at different levels and have different materials available
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek hi samay main maujuud do samskritiyaan, jinke gathan, samskruti or hastkala main bhinnata thi, unke dwaara banaae gaye vaadyayantra kii tulana karne kaa prayaas karne vaale maanavvigyaani yah nirdhaarit nahin kar sakate ki koun se vaadyayantra adhik "aadim" hai
 Sorting instruments based on geography is also partly unreliable, as one cannot determine when and how cultures approached each other and shared knowledge among themselves

 Above 1400, the overall development of the instrument can be taken on the basis of time period
 vaadyayantron ke vikaas ke kram ankan kaa vigyaan, puratathvik shilp, kalatmak ankan or saahitiyik sandarbhon par nirbhar he
 Since the data in any one research route can be incomplete, all three routes provide a better historical picture
 19veen shatabdi tak, likhit europea sangeet itihaas, in puranicke vivaranon ke saath shuru hota he ki vaadyayantron kaa avishkaar kaise kiya gaya
 Such descriptions include Jubal, a descendant of Cain and "the father of all who handle the harp and organ", Pan, the inventor and mercury of the panpipe, who created the first lier from the turtle's dry shell
 aadhunik itihaas ne aisi puranic kathaon ko maanavshastreey atakalon ke dwaara pratisthapit kiya he or kabhi-kabhi ise puratathvik sakshya dwaara pusht bhi kiya he
 Scholars believe that there is no definite "invention" of the instrument, since the definition of the term "instrument" is completely subjective to both the scholar and the future-inventor
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek homo habilis kaa apane sharir par tamaache lagaana, bina uske iraade kii parvaah kiye ek nirmaanadhin vaadyayantra ho saktaa he
 The instruments that are considered to be the first instruments beyond the human body are rattles, stampers and various types of drums
 These early instruments evolved due to the human's impulse to add sound to emotional movements, such as dance
 Eventually, some cultures added ritual programs to their instruments
 Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments, such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets
 Some of these labels have significantly different connotations than those used in modern times; Early flutes and trumpets were labeled as such for their original function and use, and not for any resemblance to modern instruments

 Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists have primarily characterized ceremonial instruments, historians have been able to distinguish between the six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: Concussion clubs, clappers, sistras, bells, cymbals, and Tingling
 Sistra is most clearly depicted in the great engravings of Amenhotep III, and is of particular interest in this because similar designs have been found in remote areas, such as among the Tbilisi, Georgia, and Yakui tribes native to the Americas
 The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments rather than any other instrument, as evidenced by their spread in Mesopotamia's sculptures, placards and seals

 Other instruments of this period include tofs, or frame drums, small bells or jingles called pamon, shofar and trumpet-like hasosra

 Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the Rigveda or religious songs
 Various drums, trumpets, harps and flutes were used in these songs

 Musicians began to design musical pieces for specific instruments

 yantra nirmaataaon ne aise gunon ko viksit kiya jo aaj bhi chal rahe hai

 Some methods arise as a result of disagreements between experts about how instruments should be classified
 jabaki vargeekaran pranali kaa puraa surveykshan karnaa is lekh ke daayre se pare he, pramukh pranaaliyon kaa ek saransh nimna he
 An ancient system, which dates back to at least the 1st century BC
 Coming from, the instruments are divided into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by moving strings; Instruments where sound is produced by the vibrations of air segments; Percussion instruments made of wood or metal; And leather-faced percussion instruments or drums
 victor-charles Mahillon later, adopted a very similar system
 He was the patron of the musical collection at the Conservatoire in Brussels and divided the instruments into four groups for the 1888 catalog of collections; Stringed instruments, howling instruments, percussion instruments and drums
 erik won hornbostel or court sacks ne baad main pracheen paddati ko liya or 1914 main Zeitschrift für Ethnologie main vargeekaran ke liye ek vyapak nai yojana prakashit kii
 His method is widely used today and is often referred to as the Hornbostel – Sachs method
 mul sacks-hornbostel paddati ne vaadyayantron ko chaar mukhya samoohon main vargeekrut kiya: Sachs later added a fifth class, electrophones, such as the thermines, which produce sounds electronically
 prayek varg ke bheetar kai up-samooh hai
 The system was criticized and revised in previous years, but it is widely used by organologists and ethnomusicologists only
 andre shafnar, Musée de l'homme ke sangrakshak, sacks-hornbostel pranali se asahmat the or unhone 1932 main apni khud kii pranali viksit kii
 Schaffner believed that the classification of an instrument should determine its anatomy rather than its method of playing
 unki paddati ne vaadyayantron ko do virgon main baanta: aise vaadya jinka sharir thos or kampan yukt he or aise vaadya jinamein compit hawa hoti he
 Western instruments, too, are often classified by their musical range when compared with other instruments of the same family
 in shabdaawaliyon ko gayan kii awaz ke vargeekaran ke aadhaar par rakhaa gaya he: Some instruments fall into more than one category: for example, the cello can be considered either a tenor or a bass, depending on how its music fits into the group and can be trombone alto, tenor
 , Or bass and French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on which range it is played on
 saanchaa:vocal and instrumental pitch ranges Many instruments have range, as part of their name: soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, alto flute, bass flute, alto recorder, bass guitar, etc
 atirikt visheshan, sopraano range se upar yaa baas se neeche ke vaadya kaa varnan karte hai, udhaaharan ke liye: sopraanino sexophone, kontrabas clerinet
 When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the range of instruments in comparison to other instruments in their family and not in the range of human voices or instruments of other families
 For example, a bass flute has a range from C3 to F♯6, while a bass clarinet plays down an octave
 vaadya yantra kaa nirmaan ek vishesh vyavsaay he jiske liye varshon kaa prashikshan, abhyaas or kabhi-kabhi ek prashikshu banane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Most manufacturers of instruments specialize in one style of instrumentation, for example, a luthear makes only stringed instruments
 kuch nirmaataa keval ek prakaar ke vaadya banaate hai jaise piano
 Regardless of how the sound is produced in the instrument, many instruments have a keyboard as the user interface
 kunjeepatal vaadyayantra, aise vaadyayantra hai jinhen jinhen ek sangeet kunjeepatal dwaara bajaayaa jaataa he
 Each key produces one or more sounds; In most keyboard instruments, there are additional means to fluctuate these sounds
 They can produce sound by moving or pumping air, by pushing or pulling the moving wires, by electronic means, or in some other way
 Sometimes, instruments that do not usually have a keyboard, such as the Gloukenspiel, have a keyboard attached to them
 haalanki unamem koi chalyman hissaa nahin hota he or unhen vadak ke haathon main pakade gaye mallett se bajaayaa jaataa he, unamem kunjiyon kii samaan bhautik vyavastha hoti he or ve samaan tareeke se dhwani tarange utpann karte hai

 henary mare america ke manovaigyanik the
 He taught at Harvard University for more than 30 years
 henry mare kaa janm 13 may 1893 main neuyark nagar main hua
 He graduated from Harvard College in 1915
 prarambh main unki ruchi itihaas main thi, isliye unhone itihaas kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 Thereafter, Murray also studied deeply in medical science
 unhone chikitsa shaastra evam jeev vigyaan se sambandhit vishyon kaa baarah varshon tak gahan adhyayan kiya
 During this period, he became interested in psychology
 unako is kshetra main adhyayan karne kii prerana yung se praapt hui
 Inspired by Yung, Murray made a deep study of subconscious psychology in the field of psychology
 unhone vyakti vigyaan naam se vyakti ke vyaktitv kii sankalpana kii
 Later, person science was considered a branch of modern psychology and in-depth study of psychological facts related to personality development began to be done under this branch
 mare ke vyaktitv siddhanth kaa mul aadhaar yah he ki vyakti 'abhiprerit pashu' he
 Murray emphasizes biological determinants in the concept of personality
 navafrydwadiyon ne jaivik paksh kii kadachit avhelnaa kii thi parantu mare ke anusaar vyaktitv kii kalpana bina mastishk ke asambhav he
 According to Murray- is paribhaasha main vyaktitv ko nirantar gatyil mana gaya he
 In addition, some functions of the person are also mentioned in the definition
 mare ne vyaktitv ke nimna prakaarya maane hai- Henry Murray used and interpreted some specific conceptual words for these functions of personality
 jo is prakaar he- Murray believes that a person's personality is influenced by stressors created by needs
 ye aavashyaktaaen jaivik, manovaigyanik evam saamaajik hoti hai
 Therefore, it is the effort of a person to reduce the stress generated in this way
 in aavashyaktaaon evam ichchhaaon kii purti vyakti vyaktigat saamaajik tathaa saanskrithik str par karata he
 Because these kinds of desires contain frustrations and intentions
 chunki manushya ek saamaajik praani he or uske liye yah sambhav nahin ki vah samaaj se alag rahakar apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti kar sake
 In this regard, Henry Murray opines that the lack of stress is not as satisfying as the stress reduction process
 ve frid kii is baat se sahamat nahin the ki tanaav kaa abhaav vyakti ko santosh pradaan karata he balki unke anusaar tanaav main kami ke kaaran jo santosh miltaa he vah tanaav ke abhaav main nahin
 Therefore, according to Murray, the origin of stress and then lack thereof are contained in the functions of personality
 mare ke anusaar vyaktitv kii sanrachana main un upayon kaa bhi bahut mahatva he jo vibhinn prakaar kii aavashyaktaaon evam lakshyon ko kram main nirdhaarit karte hai
 These measures determine the individual in their needs
 arthath jo aavashyaktaa jitani mahatvapurn hogi, use utane hi mahatvapurn kram nirdhaaran main rakhaa jayega
 This process of ordering goals occupies an important place in the structure of personality
 henry mare kaa yah maananaa he ki aavashyaktaaon kaa kram nirdhaaran karke vyakti kam samay main adhik kaary kar paata he
 a person fulfills his needs which are very important and likewise pays attention to the attainment of those goals which are more important in terms of country and time
 mare ke anusaar jis vyakti main kram nirdhaaran kii kshamta jitani adhik hogi, vah vyakti utani hi adhik seemaa tak dvandvon evam tanaavon se mukt rahegaa
 According to Murray, in addition to the reduction of stresses related to needs, self-expression is also very important for personality
 jaise koi vyakti sangeet dwaara atmabhivyakti kii ichha kare to use is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana hota he ki vah aise sthaan, samay or gane kaa chunaav kare jo dusron ke liye dukhakar na ho
 In this regard, Murray used the term process-work)
 prakriya kaary kaa swaroop spasht karte hue mare yah maanate hai ki man kabhi-kabhi aisi kriyaaon main leen ho jaataa he jo thode samay kii hoti he parantu inke madhyam se man ko anand miltaa he
 It is in this context that Murray believes that the actions of the body and mind are related to such fantasies that bring joy to the person and become a medium of self-expression
 kaalaantar main kuch kriyaayein ek nishchit rup le leti hai
 For example, actions related to drama, dance, music etc
 are helpful in the soul expression of a person
 mare ke anusaar kram-suchan main vyakti maansik shakti kii sahaayta se kuch yojanaayen banaata he or vah yah dekhtaa he ki uski purti kis prakaar kii ja sakati he or uske parinaam kaa swaroop kya hoga
 a person makes his plans or goals, then lists them to fulfill or materialize them
 jis lakshya ko pehle praapt karnaa he use praathamikta dekar pratham kram main rakhega
 In this way a person arranges goals according to their preference and needs
 is avadharana main mare yah maanate hai ki vyaktiyon main yogyata, kshamta, shaikshanik uplabdhi or aakanksha kii drushti se samarupata nahin paayi jaati he
 For example, the level of aspiration is very high but there is a decrease in aptitude
 kabhi aakanksha ke str neeche hai to kabhi charitra dosha hota he
 Therefore, the aspiration of a person is fulfilled only when the person determines it by keeping in mind his ability, ability and intellectual need
 vyakti ko apni maansik, bhavatmak, saamaajik, naitik evam shaareerik kshamtaaon ko dhyaan main rakhkar apane aakanksha str kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 According to this concept, society, heredity and environment are considered important in the development of personality
 inke vichaar main vyakti kaa ateet tathaa uskaa itihaas donon uske vyaktitv main mahatvapurn hote hai
 Knowledge of what society expects from a person and what a person expects from society, then it is not easy to act accordingly
 vyakti ke vyaktitv kaa saamaajik paksh prabal hota he
 People who act according to social expectations get the praise of society
 parantu kabhi-kabhi aisi sthitiyaan bhi banati hai ki vyakti apane samaaj kii manyataon ke anusaar kaary karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 There can be many reasons for this and it can also be a reason for the society to become conservative
 saamanytah vyakti ke vyaktitv main jo saamaajik evam saanskrithik nirdhaaran hai, ve is baat kii ore sanket karte hai ki vyakti ko koun sa vyavhaar karnaa chahie or koun sa nahin, koun se kaary naitik hai or kin kaaryon ko samaaj main aniatik mana he
 a person has to follow social expectations according to social and cultural values and by doing so he gets satisfaction
 henry mare ne vyakti ke vyaktitv vikaas main aavashyaktaaon ko mahatvapurn sthaan diya
 According to him, there are many types of biological and psychological needs of a person, in his book Exploration in Personality, Murray also gave a list of biological and psychological needs
 aavashyaktaaon kii yah suchi badi vyapak he
 Nevertheless, a brief description is being given of it
 uparokt aavashyaktaaon kii suchi jo henry mare ne di he unke atirikt unhone aavashyaktaaon ke prakaaron par bhi vyakhyaayein kii hai
 Henry Murray has outlined some of the requirements: ye aavashyaktaaen multah sharir sambandhi hoti hai
 Hunger, persistence, breathing, excrement, etc
 have been considered as internal requirements
 henry mare ke anusaar ye aavashyaktaaen praathmik hai
 These are secondary requirements
 ye aavashyaktaaen aantarik aavashyaktaaon se utpann hoti hai tathaa manojnya rup dhaaran kar leti hai
 Like = desire for collection of things, desire for respect and dominance in society etc
 henry mare ke anusaar kuch aavashyaktaaen aisi hai jo shaareerik kriyaaon athwa gati sambandhi vyavhaaron dwaara prakat hoti hai, ye aavashyaktaaen prakat hai
 These requirements have mental functions like daydream or imagination
 henry mare ke anusaar in aavashyaktaaon kaa sambandh vyakti ke paraham se hota he
 When a person makes ideals, values etc
 a part of life, then the latent needs are active because in this the person is unable to reveal all his needs
 kuch aavashyaktaaen simit hoti he, ye kendrik aavashyaktaaen hai
 Some requirements are related to all things
 jab vyakti yaa vastu se ye aavashyaktaaen adhik sambandhit hoti hai to ye baad main manovikas kaa rup le leti hai
 If the requirements are radiated or not related to the person or thing, then this also creates psychosis
 henry mare ke anusaar jo aavashyaktaaen vyakti kii aantarik vrittiyon se hai yaa jo bina kisi uddipan ke sahaj rup main hoti hai, ve agralakshi aavashyaktaaen hai
 The importance of these requirements has been recognized in the social context
 jab vyakti apane saathi se aage badhkar vaarta karata he yaa anukriya ke liye prerit karata he to ve aavashyaktaaen agralakshi hai
 According to Henry Murray, when a person motivates his partner to respond, the response of the partner is the reactionary needs
 kuch kriyaayein anishchit rup se bina kisi lakshash kii hoti hai, jaise koi vyakti bina lakshash kii maansik kriya main leen rahata he or kaalpanik jagat main vicharan karata he, henry mare ke anusaar ye kriyaayein prakram kriya kii dein hai
 When a person is in creative desire, then a certain need is met
 isamen kaalpanik jagat main vicharan karne kii vipareet kriya hoti he
 a person desires to prove his superiority in any field
 henry mare ne aavashyaktaaon ke vibhinn prakaar nirdhaarit kiye hai phir bhi unka vichaar he ki sabhi aavashyaktaaen ek duusare se sambandh rakhti hai
 Some requirements are acute and it is necessary to satisfy them immediately
 aavashyaktaaon kii tivrata or mahatv ke aadhaar par vyakti unka kram nirdhaarit karata he tathaa uske samaadhaan ke liye praytn karata he
 Some requirements are satisfied by several attempts
 kuch aavashyaktaaen paryaavaran se sambandhit hoti hai
 Some needs are inspired by internal and external life
 aavashyaktaaon kii purti ko prabhavit karne ke liye vyakti or uske paryaavaran main ek sambandh hota he
 For this, Henry Murray introduced the concept of pressure or press
 jis prakaar aavashyaktaaen vyavhaar se prabhavit hoti hai usee prakaar paryaavaran ke prabhaavon dwaara bhi vyavhaar prabhavit hote hai
 It is necessary for a person to observe social rules according to his needs and to behave
 ye saamaajik niyam hi ek prakaar ke dabaav hai jo vyakti ke vyavhaar ko puri chhot nahin dete hai
 In society, one also has to take care of others
 is prakaar saamaajik sandarbh main hi unki ichchhaaon or aavashyaktaaon kii purti honi hoti he
 Henry Murray made a pressure list just like the different types of requirements
 in dabaavon ko do virgon main baanta gaya he- The list of pressures presented by Henry Murray is based on family, health, society relations
 in dabaavon kaa vivaran nimna prakaar se he- Henry Murray has also highlighted the values of the individual
 unhone saat prakaar ke mulya nirdhaarit kiye hai
 These values are- henry mare kaa vyaktitv vikaas ke bare main yah maananaa he ki janm se lekar mrityu paryant vyakti ke vyaktitv kaa jo itihaas he vahi vastav main vyaktitv he
 He mainly mentioned three things on personality development- henry mare ne vyaktitv vikaas main manogranthiyon kaa vishesh prabhaav mana he
 These psychopaths are considered as infantile attitudes
 ye paanch prakaar kii hai- Murray's belief about this gland is that the child feels more secure while in the mother's womb
 jab uskaa janm hota he to garbh se baahar aate hi usko bahsh vaataavaran se bhay lagata he or achaanak usamen asuraksha kii bhaavana utpann ho jaati he
 As a result, the newborn wants to go to the womb again and this is where the closed psychosis develops
 henry mare ke anusaar sanvrutt manogranthi ke mul main garbh main pehle kii sthiti main jane kii ichha nihit hoti he tathaa duusari baat yah he ki usamen asuraksha evam asahaayta se sambandhit duschintaa ho jaati he
 The third thing is that the newborn child wants to be free from suffocation through gestation
 henry mare ne janm se purv kii avasthaa main jane vaali sthiti ko 'saral sanvrutt manogranthi' mana he
 Mentioning this, Murray said that the newborn has a desire to go back to a place like the womb and secure himself
 kyonki garbh ke bheetar uski sari aavashyaktaaen apane aap puri hoti rahati hai tathaa yah anash vastu par nirbhar nahin rahata he
 According to Murray, the second form of closed psychology is based on fear
 navjaat shishu jab janm letaa he tab khuli jagah chahta he yaa girane ke bhay se trast rahata he or yah manogranthi bhay manogranthi ke rup main viksit hoti he
 Murray considered the third form of closed occultism to be 'liberation'
 isamen shishu swatantra hona chahta he, baahar nikalnaa chahta he tathaa khuli jagah main rahanaa chahta he
 Murray named this gland as the Exodus Psychology
 frid kii tarah henry mare ne bhi shishu ke khaane-pine or chusane kii kriyaaon main jo sukh miltaa he use mukh manogranthi ke antargat rakhaa, haalanki henry mare ne iske kaam vaasana ke paksh par utana jor nahin diya jitna ki frid ne
 Henry Murray has considered three types of oral encyclopaedias - mukh avlambita manogranthi ke falswaroop baccha mukh sambandhi kriyaaon jaise khaane-pine or chusane main laga rahata he
 When he breastfeeds the mother or sucking his thumb, he gets the satisfaction of inculcation
 aakraamakata manogranthi main baccha kisi vastu ko munh se katkar sukh kii anubhuti karata he
 Biting the mother's breast or cutting someone unconscious is the satisfaction of aggression
 yahi kriya kaalaantar main aakraamakata ko janm detii he
 The bite or stuttering of something from the mouth even when it is large, indicates that oral aggression in the person is strong
 mukh asveekaran manogranthi main baccha apni asahmati va aprasannataa vashakt karne ke liye thukta he or mukh sambandhi kriyaaon or doston ke prati apni aprasannataa yaa durbhaawanaaon ko prakat karata he
 Such as refusing to drink baby milk or not consuming any special type of food
 henry mare ke anusaar jab baccha baar-baar mel tyaagta he to use ek prakaar kii sukhanubhuti hoti he
 This is what Murray has called the anal disclaimer psychosis
 jab baccha mel tyaag ko roktaa he or sheeghra mel tyaag nahin karata to is pravriti ko guda avrodh manogranthi mana
 In this occult, the child or person feels a lustrous type of pleasure while urinating
 kuch bachche bistar par hi mutr tyaag karte he
 He gets happiness by doing so
 yah bhi mutrmargeey manogranthi kaa ek rup he
 Henry Murray, like Freudists, did not give the Castration Psychology a significant place
 unka kahana he ki badhiyaakaran manogranthi kii vyakhya uske shabdic arthon tak hi simit rakhni chahie
 What they mean to say is that in the imagination of the child that if his penis can be cut, then a result of this creates a worry in his mind
 parantu is duschintaa ko sabhi prakaar ke manastantrika tapi manovikar kaa kaaran hi maan sakate he
 On the development of personality, Henry Murray made it clear that biological determinants as well as cultural determinants have an influence on this
 dow jaiswal ke anusaar henry mare ne spasht kiya ki prayek vyakti- When there are similarities in different biological and cultural determinants in a person, then it is similar to all individuals
 kai samaajon va samskritiyon main kuch aise tatv avashya hote he jo sabhi samskritiyon main ubhaynisht hote hai
 Similarly, from the point of view of life science, many elements are found to be the same in human body composition
 mare ne apni duusari baat main yah mana ki prayek vyakti kuch vyaktiyon ke samaan he, is tathash main unhone vyakti main paae jane vaale un gunon kaa zikr kiya he jinka sambandh ek samskruti se hota he
 Some similar qualities are found in the personality of individuals living in a culture
 jaise ki ek bhartiya ke vyaktitv main bhartiyata ke kuch ubhaynishth gun paae jaaenge jo bhartiya samskruti kii dein he
 In the same way, some common traits will be found among the people of other countries such as Germany, which is the result of German culture
 apni teesri baat main mare ye kehete hai ki ek vyakti kisi duusare vyakti ke samaan nahin hota
 It refers to the exclusivity of personality
 vyaktitv kii ananyta jaivik va saanskrithik donon kaarnon se, ling or aayu, sharir kii banaavat, varna aadi ke kaaran se hoti he
 In addition to this, the limit of physical strength, the capacity to learn, the extent of frustration and frustration can be varied in each person
 ye kaaran bhi vyakti kii ananyta nirdhaarit karne main sahaayak hote he
 According to Henry Murray, the process of socialization of man starts in his family from infancy
 navjaat shishu ko parivaar ke sadsy sikhaanaa prarambh kar dete hai
 Therefore, the family and its members have an important role in socialization
 is str par vyakti apane par niyantran, apane vyavhaar main sanshodhan, baanchhneeya va avaanchhneeya aavashyaktaaon kii abhivyakti par niyantran, avaanchhneeya vastuon athwa vyakti se sambandh na rakhana, sabhi kaam samay par karnaa sikh jaataa he
 Apart from these, people also learn to walk according to the prevailing rules, laws and customs of the society
 baccha jab bada hota he tab parivaar se nikalakar paas-pados tathaa vidhyalay main jaataa he, vahaan par bhi uskaa samajikaran hota rahata he
 As a person's physical development and age increases, he learns socialization from his biological and cultural determinants
