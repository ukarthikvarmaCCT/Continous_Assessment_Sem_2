 is kal ke dauraan, congress ke ke netritv main kai majboot sarkaron kaa raaj dekha, jinka netritv kai shaktishaalee vyaktitv ke pradhanmantrigan ne kiya
 The first Prime Minister of India was Jawaharlal Nehru, who took the oath of office on 15 August 1947
 unhone aviral 17 varshon tak seva di
 He held this position for 3 full and one tenures
 unka kaarykaal, may 1964 main unki mrityu par samaapt hua

 tathaa, janata party kii gathbandhan ke taraf se morarji desai desh ke pehle gaiyr-congressi pradhanmantri bane
 Prime Minister Morarji Desai's government was highly detailed and composed by political parties of many opposing ideologies, which were difficult to unite and maintain consensus and coordination on various political decisions

 Thereafter, for a fleeting time, as Deputy Prime Minister in Morarji's government, Chaudhary Charan Singh, with the support of the Congress, proved the majority and took the oath of Prime Minister

 in aarthik nitiyon ko, aagaamee sarkaron ne jari rakhaa, or bhartiya arthvyavastha ko vishwa kii sabase gatisheel arthvyavasthaaon main se ek banaaya
 Apart from these economic changes, Narasimha Rao's tenure also saw the demolition of the disputed structure of Ayodhya's Babri masjid-ramjanmabhoomi and the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party as a national level party
 narsingh raav ji kaa kaarykaal, may 1996 ko samaapt hua, jiske baad, desh ne agle teen varshon main chaar, laghukaalin pradhanmayon ko dekha: pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi kii 13 divasiy shasankaal, tatpashchaat, pradhanmantri ech di devgauda or indrakumar guzaraal, donon kii ek varsh se kam samay kaa kaarykaal evam tatpashchaat, punah pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii 19 maah kii sarkaar
 The government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, elected in 1998, took some very concrete and challenging steps
 may 1998 main sarkaar ke gathan ke ek maheene ke baad, sarkaar ne pokharan main paanch bhutalia parmaanu visphot karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Many Western countries, including the US, imposed economic sanctions on India in protest of these blasts, but due to the support of Russia, France, Gulf countries and some others, this ban of Western countries completely failed
 is aarthik pratibandh kii paristhiti ko bakhubi sanbhaalane ko atal sarkaar kii behtareen kootnithik jeet ke rup main dekha gaya
 a few months later, Pakistan also conducted a nuclear test in response to the Indian nuclear test
 donon deshon ke bich bigadate halaaton ko dekhte hue, sarkaar ne rishte behatar karne kii koshish kii
 In February 1999, the two countries signed the Lahore Declaration, declaring both countries to end mutual rivalries, increase trade and use their nuclear capability for peaceful purposes
 17 april 1999 ko jayalalita kii party iedamak ne sarkaar se apana samarthan he diya, or nae chunaavon kii ghoshnaa kerani padi
 And the Atal government was reduced to the level of periodic governance until elections

 This action was successful and within about 2 months, the Indian Saina conquered Pakistan

 However, during his reign, in 2002, the hindu-muslim riots that followed the Godhra carnage in Gujarat incited India's most violent and painful community riots in post-independence India, especially in Gujarat and many other parts of the country
 sarkaar par or gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri, narendra modi, par us samay, dango ke dauraan roak-tham ke uchit kadam nahin uthaane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha

 In addition, Manmohan Singh's tenure faced a number of strategic and security-related challenges
 26 november 2008 ko mumbai par hue aatankwaadi hamale ke baad, desh main kai suraksha sudhaar karyanvit kiye gaye
 At the end of his first term with the US, on the issue of the civil nuclear deal, the government had almost collapsed with the Left Front's withdrawal of support, but the government was able to prove a majority
 2009 ke chunaav main congress or bhi majboot janadesh ke saath sadan main ai or pradhanmantri manmohan singh pradhanmantri ke aasaan par vidyaman rahe

 The Guru Gita contains a dialogue of Lord Shiva and Parvati in which Parvati requests Lord Shiva to explain the Guru and his significance
 isamen bhagwaan shankar guru kya he, uskaa mahatv, guru kii puja karne kii vidhi, guru gita ko padhne ke laabh aadi kaa varnan karte hai
 How glorious is that Satguru who can be

 All his religions, iniquities, sins and virtues etc

 wiliam james america darshanik evam manovaigyanik the jinhone chikitsak ke rup main bhi prashikshan paaya tha
 He separated psychology from philosophy, so he is also considered the father of psychology
 wiliam james ne manovigyaan ke adhyayan hetu ek pustak likhi jiskaa naam "principles of psychology" he
 Its brother Henry James was a noted novelist
 aakarshak lekhanstyli or abhivyakti kii kushalta ke liye james vikhyath hai
 William James was born on 11 January 1842 in New York
 james ne harvard medical skool main chikitsavigyaan kaa adhyayan kiya or vahiin 1872 se 1907 tak kramash: shareeravigyaan, manovigyaan or darshan kaa praadhyaapak rahaa
 From 1899 to 1901 he gave lectures on natural religion at the University of Edinburgh and philosophy at Oxford University in 1908
 26 agast, 1910 ko uski mrityu ho gai
 In 1890, his book Principles of Psychology was published, which revolutionized the field of psychology, and James gained global fame with that one book
 apni anya rachanaaon main usne darshan tathaa dharm kii samasyaon ko sulajhane main apni manovaigyanik manyataon kaa upyog kiya or unka samaadhaan usne apane falanumeyapramavad or aadharbhoot anubhavvaad main paaya
 James, a consequentialist, has established 'knowledge' as the GV and environment, considering part of the greater practical state by which one distinguishes himself in the world
 is prakaar satya koi purvavritt vaastaviktaa nahin he, apitu vah pratyay kii vyaavhaarik safalataa ke anshon par aadhaarit he
 The importance of all intellectual actions lies in their ability to fulfill practical objectives
 aadharbhoot anubhavvaad james ne pehle manovaigyanik siddhant ke rup main prastut kiya
 Unlike John Locke and George Berkley, he believed that the changing states of consciousness are interrelated; Accordingly, the relationship is established in conditions of overall experience; No external power like brain etc
 is helpful in it
 mastishk pratyaksh anubhav kii samagrata main bhed karata he
 James's religious beliefs are based on consequentialism and fundamental empiricism
 falanumey pramanyawad satya kii apeksha dharmik vishwaason kii vyakhya main adhik sahaayak tha; kyonki vishwaas praaia: vyaavhaarik hote hai yahan tak ki tarkon ke pramaan ke abhaav main bhi maanya hote hai; kintu parinamvadidrushtikon se satya kii, paribhaasha sthir karnaa sandigdh he
 In 'the Will to Believe' James emphasizes the evidence of conscience or sentiment and proves that purpose and determination form the perspective of a person
 'da varietiess ov relijas experience' main james ne vyakti ko niskriy or shaktiheen dikhalaayaa he tathaa yah bhi pradarshit kiya he ki uski raksha koi bahya shakti karti he
 James's interpretation of religious feeling from empiricism is impossible because these experiences have a direct connection to a person's subconscious
 james ke dharmadarshan main teen baaten mukhya hai- James's other published books are 'psychology', Brief Course ',' Human Immortality ', Talks to Teachers on Psychology', 'pragmatism', 'A Pluralistic Universe', 'the Meaning of Truth,' Memories and Studies', 'some Problems' 'own Philosophy', 'essays in Radical Empiricism'

 Modern literary Ukrainian developed on the basis of the southeastern dialect
 ukraini bhashaa ruparachana or vaakyavinyas main roosi bhashaa ke nikat he
 The development of Ukrainian language started from the 12th century
 is kaal se ukraini janata ne anek lokkathaon or lokgeeton kii rachana kii
 During this period, heroic stories, mythological stories and religious creations began to develop
 praaia: in kritiyon ke rachayitaaon ke naam agyaat hai
 Plays also evolved from the 16th century

 EY as a well-known poet, playwright and prose Franco is noted, who has given a detailed description of the life of the Ukrainian people in his majority works
 suprasiddh kavyitri lesya ukrinca or kavi kotsubinsky ne apni kavitaaon main ukraini janata ke krantikari sangharsh kaa chithran kiya
 After the Great Socialist Revolution of October 1917, Ukrainian literature began to grow even more
 is kaal ke sabase prasiddh kavi pawalo tichina or maxim rilski hai, evam nai peedi ke kavi goncharenko, pervomaski aadi hai
 The biggest gift in the field of drama is that of Alexander Kornachuk
 upanyaaskaaron or kahanikaron main natan ribak evam vadim sobako sabase adhik vikhyath hai
 Ukrainian literature began to develop on the basis of socialist realism during this period
 gadhykar or kavi aadhunik soviet ukraina kaa or veertapurna ateet itihaas kaa chithran karte the
 After the Great Patriotic War of 1941–45, more new poets and writers were born in Ukrainian literature
 vartmaan ukraini kavi, jaise pawalo tichina, maxim rilski, micola vazhaan, andrai malishko, sosura aadi apni kavitaaon main mazdooron or kisaanon ke jivan kaa chithran karte tathaa vishvashanti ke liye sangharsh or vibhinn deshon kii janata kii maitri kii bhavanaayen karte hai
 Ukrainian playwrights, such as Kornachuk, Sobko, Dmytrenko, etc
 compose social, historical and satirical plays
 in naatakon kaa pradarshan soviet sangh ke bahusankhyak theatreon main kiya jaataa he
 Ukrainian prose is also developing rapidly
 oles gonchaar, natan ribak, petron panch, stelmah aadi apane upanyaason or kahaniyon main soviet janata kii yudhkalin bahaduree kaa or samyavaadee samaaj ke nirmaan ke liye mazdooron, kisaanon or buddhijiviyon ke veertapurna parishram kaa varnan karte hai
 Ukrainian writers take an active part in the social life of the Soviet Union
 ukraini lekhakon kii anek kritiyaan soviet sangh kii anya anek bhashaaon tathaa videshi bhashaaon main anudit ho rahi hai or samast soviet sangh tathaa videshon main lokapriy ho gai hai
 Also, the literature of other languages of the Soviet Union and the works of foreign literature are being translated and published in the Ukrainian language
 inamen pracheen evam arvachin bhartiya sahitya kii anek kritiyaan bhi sammilit hai
 Indian poetesses have generally considered the number of juices to be nine, of which comic juice is the main juice
 jaise jihva ke aswaad ke chah ras prasiddh hai usee prakaar hriday ke aswaad ke nau ras prasiddh hai
 The taste of lingua is placed in the category of cosmic bliss because it is directly related to cosmic objects
 hriday ke aswaad ko alokik anand kii koti main mana jaataa he kyonki uskaa sidhaa sambandh vastuon se nahin kintu bhavanubhootiyon se he
 There is a difference between the taste of feeling and feeling
 bhartiya kavyachaaryon ne rason kii sankhya praaia: nau hi maani he kyonki unke mat se nau bhav hi aise hai jo manushya kii mul pravritiyon se ghanishthatya sambandhit hokar sthayitv kii puri kshamta rakhte hai or ve hi viksit hokar vastut: ras sangya kii prapti ke adhikari kahe ja sakate hai
 This recognition has also been controversial, but has accepted the nature of humor unquestioningly from all
 manovigyaan ke visheshgyon ne bhi haas ko mul pravriti ke rup main samuchit sthaan diya he or iske vishleshan main paryaapt manan chintan kiya he
 This contemplation has been given a more elaborate expression by Western poetry than Pravatya poetry, but still it cannot be said that they have studied this element in its entirety and or any such definition of the poetic expression of humor or Haas Has given which can accommodate all types of examples
 bhartiya aacharyon ne ek prakaar ke sutararup main hi iskaa prakhyapan kiya he kintu unki sankshipt uktiyon main paashchaatya samikshakon ke praaia: sabhi nishkarshon or tatwon kaa saraltapurvak antarbhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 Bharatamuni's Natyashastra for humor is says- bhavaprakash main likhaa he- The narrator's statement is- isi prakaar- The phrase of the decider is- taatpary yah he ki haas ek pritiparak bhav he or chittavikas kaa ek rup he
 He is perplexed by distorted shape, distorted speech, distorted ethics, distorted designation, distorted decking, distorted semantics, distorted speech, distorted gestures, etc
 - the humor with these distortions, whether of the actor, of the speaker, or of anyone else
 
 vikruti kaa taatpary he pratyaashit se vipareet athwa vilakshan koi aisa vaichitrya, koi aisa betukapan, jo hamen pritikar jaan pade, kleshkar na jaan pade
 These traits include almost all the symptoms of western critics, as far as they are concerned with humor subjects
 aisa haas jab viksit hokar hamen kavikaushal dwaara saadharaneekrut rup main, athwa acharya pan
 ramchandra shukla kii shabdaawalee ke anusaar, mukt dasha main praapt hota he, vah hasyaras kehalaata he
 The expression of the sense of Haas remains relative to the country
 ghar par koi khuli deh baitha ho to darshak ko hansee na aavegi parantu utsav main bhi vah isi tarah pahunch jaae to uskaa aacharan pratyaashit se vipareet yaa vikrut mana jane ke kaaran hansee jagaa degaa; uskaa vyavhaar haas kii janani ho jayega
 If a young person is adorned, it is a matter of boredom, but a shabby old man will have a reason for adornment; We will surely start laughing at the wrestler who has fallen from the chair, but only our compassionate sympathy will grow on the child falling from the roof
 yah pehle hi kaha gaya he ki haas kaa aadhaar priti par hota he na ki dwesh par, atev yadi kisi kii prakruti, pravriti, swabhaav, aachaar aadi kii vikruti par kataaksh bhi karnaa ho to vah katukti ke rup main nahin kintu priyokti ke rup main hogi, uski tah main jalan athwa nicha dikhaane kii bhaavana na hokar vishuddh sanshuddhi kii bhaavana hogi
 This eloquence with a sense of purification will not be in the vocabulary of preaching but in the terminology of Ranjata
 hasya ke bhedon par bhi aacharyon ne vichaar kiya he
 He made two distinctions of humor
 ek he aatmasth or doosraa he parastha
 From the point of view of comedians, selfish humor is automatically the laughing of that character and superstitious humor is to make others laugh
 saamaajikon yaa sahruday shrotaaon, athwa natyadarshakon kii drushti se aatmasth hasya he anyon kii hansee ke bina swat: unamem udbhut hasya or parastha hasya he dusron ko hansataa hua dekhakar unamem utpann hasya
 By understanding this difference of perspectives, the idea of the meanings of these two words can be easily eliminated
 phir, aacharyon ne hasya ke chah bhed kiye hai- smit, hasith, vihasit, upahasit, avahasit or atihasit; jinhen bhavbhed nahin kintu hasankriya ke hi bhed maananaa padegaa
 In short, smiling eyes are smitten
 battisi dikh padana hasith he, ho hi kii si dhwani nikal padana vihasit he
 Rise of limb is absent
 pet pakadaneyvaali hansee avahasit he or puure thahaakevali jhakzorkarini paslithod hansee atihasit he
 The philosopher has called Smit and Hasit worthy of the best
 vihasit or upahasit ko madhyam vargeey logon ke yogya or apasit tathaa atihasit ko neech logon ke yogya kaha he
 There should be a dignity in the theater for the audience to laugh, even from that point of view, it may be considered good, moderate and inappropriate
 nahin to jhakzor denevaali hansee keval nichon kii vastu samaj lene se ucch vargeey lok swasthya ke ek mahatvapurn tatv se vanchit rah jaaenge
 Dr
 Ramkumar Varma has considered three distinctions of humor with a desire for the effect of Uttam, Madhyam, Adham and has written twelve distinctions of Hasan Kriya by multiplying them with Athastha, Prastha
 smit, hasith aadi hasankriyaabhedon ko hasya kaa anubhav hi kaha ja saktaa he
 It is a different thing to just describe these experiences and it is a different thing to create these experiences in the social through your creation
 hasyaras kii safal rachana vah he jo hasyaras ke anubhav anayas utpann kara de
 There are five major differences of humor from the opinion of foreign scholars, namely Humer, Witt, Satire, Irony and Fars
 humar or fars hasya ke vishay se sambandhit hai jabaki bit, satair or irni kaa sambandh ukti ke kaushal se he jinamein pichley do kaa uddeshy keval santushti hi na hokar sanshuddhi bhi rahaa karata he
 Parody is also a genre of humor that has a relationship with the above skills but whose main purpose is satisfaction
 irni kaa arth parihaas chintya he
 In ridicule, we think, Irony should also be considered to have an inferiority or else it will become an object out of humor
 vit athwa vagvaidadhya ko ek vishisht alankaar kaha ja saktaa he
 The tithes of Indian literary scholars have done justice to Shringar, even with humor, though Bharata Muni has given its origin to Shringar i
e
 it is considered to be the magnitude of Rati or Preity and it was only after Shringar that the status of importance in Navaras Have given
 anand ke saath iskaa sidhaa sambandh he or na keval ranjanta kii drushti se kintu upyogita kii drushti se bhi isaki apni vishistataa he
 This body removes the tension of the mind, eradicates the grit of nature, paves the way for social improvement with introspection and self-refinement, eliminating the tiredness of the individual and society, fostering freshness in them and becoming a benefactor of public health
 yah nishchit he ki sanskrit sahitya tathaa hindi sahitya main is hasyaras ke mahatv ke anupaat se iske uttam udaahranon kii kami hi he
 Yet from the historical overview it is also clear that the flow of humor in literature has been going on continuously since the Vedic period till today, although before the present period, it is not as diverse as it is seen today
 hasyaras kii dhara ke vaividhya ko vishay or vyanjana kii drushti se dekha ja saktaa he
 We can divide the subject into shape, nature, situation, dress, speech, behavior and object
 akruti kaa betukapan he motopa, kurupata, bhaddaapan, angabhang, beja najaakat, tond, kubad, naariyon kaa atyant kaalaapan, aadi
 Humorous compositions have been done on many of these subjects
 dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki ek samay kaa haasyaaspad vishay sabhi samayon kaa haasyaaspad vishay ho jaae, aisa nahin hua karata
 Today, disgrace, cleanliness, etc
 are not considered as the subjects of humor, hence, making compositions on them will not be considered as a symbol of humor
 prakruti yaa swabhaav kaa betukapan he ujaddpan, bevakoofi, paakhand, jhenp, khushaamad, amaryadit fashanparasti, kanjusee, dikhaava panditmanyata, atihasypatrata, anadhikarpurn ahanmanyta, aadi
 Composing the absurdity of nature as your goal is more expansive than the absurdity of nature
 rachanakaaron ne kanjusee aadi kii vrittiyon par achche vyang kiye hai, parantu abhi is disha main anek vishay achoote hi chhot gaye hai
 The absurdity of the situation is the added Gangmadari, the lapse of time, the helplessness of a person etc
 in the incompatibility of society
 iskaa atyant sundar udhaaharan he ramcharitamanas kaa kevat prasang jisamen ram kaa marm samaj jane kii ding haakanevaale murkh kintu panditmanya kevat ko ram koi uttar nahin de pate or ek prakaar se chupchaap aatmasamarpan kar dete hai
 It was a satire of circumstance
 vesh kaa betukapan, haspaatr naton or vidushakon kaa priy vishay hi rahaa he or prahasanon, ramlilaon, raasalilaon, "gammat", tamaashon aadi main aasaani se diya ja saktaa he
 Dharmadhvajis disguise, disguised fashionistas, "masculine woman" disguise are absurd ones that can be the subject of creation
 vesh ke betukepan kii rachana bhi akruti ke betukepan kii rachana ke samaan praaia: chhichley darje kii hogi
 The absurdity of speech is to stutter, to put a pillowcase like "which is so" on the matter, to utter ejaculations, inhuman sounds, boiling of boonies, gossiping, panditau, ganwaru language, slang of many language words, etc
 vyavhaar kaa betukapan he asamanjas ghatnaayen, foohad harakatein, atiranjana, charitrik vikruti, saamaajik uchhrankhaltaayen, kuch kaa kuch samaj baithna, kah baithna yaa kar baithna, kathputlipan ityadi
 The absurdity of behavior can provide abundant material for the expression of humor, whether it is in the sense of humor or ridicule
 vastu kii drushti se manushya hi kyon, dev daanav pashu pakshi, khatmal machhar, jhaadoo, tokani, plate rashning aadi anek vishyon par safaltarpuk kalmen chalaai gai hai
 But as far as the fun of these items and especially with the favored gods and administrative satire, will be said to be an officer of the category of humor
 khizabhari anya rachanaayen raudra, vibhats yaa anya rason kii koti main pahunch ja sakati hai
 The expression of anticipation in expression can be seen and shown in many ways
 ise betukapan, vikruti, asamanjasata aadi shabdon se thik thik nahin samajhaayaa ja saktaa
 It is the speech that requires enough talent even in the creator and in the creator, listener or reader of that creation
 jis saamaajik main hasya kii ichha or aashaa na hogi, swabhaav main vinodpriyata or hasyonmukhataa na hogi tathaa buddhi ke shabdasanketon or vaakyagat angon ko samajhane kii kshamta na hogi, samajhnaa chahie ki uske liye hasyaras kii rachanaayen he hi nahin
 Similarly, an artist who does not have sophistication, counterproductive and the art of word weighing cannot be a successful writer of humor
 safal lekhak apratyaashit shabdadambar ke sahare, shabd kii apratyaashit vyutpatti ke sahare ; apratyaashit vilakshan upamaaon aadi alankaaron ke sahare ; vilakshan tarkoktiyon ke sahare ; vagvaidagdhya kii anek vidhaon ke sahare yatha, arth ke pher badal ke sahare pratyutar main nahale kii jagah dahala lagane kii kala ke sahare ; satair ke sahare "", krishnayan main uddhav kii ukti kii bhawan jaraihai madhupuri, shyaam bajaihain benu? bhavaniprasad mishra ji kaa geetfarosh aadi), kataaksh ke sahare ke sahare ; virup vachananukaran ke sahare ; tathaa isi prakaar kii anekanek abhivyanjana shaileyon se hasyaras kaa udrek karaayaa karte hai
 From our point of view, in our understanding humor is either especially of humor or of ridicule
 in donon shabdon ko hamane paramparaagat arth main seemaabaddh nahin kiya he
 We consider the satisfaction of poetry as a category of gimmick and the one who is pure in a sense of ridicule
 anek rachanaaon main donon kaa mishran bhi hua karata he
 It is necessary to take care of the list of socials for both humor and ridicule
 maansal shringarparak haas, aajkal ke shisht samaaj ko ruchikar nahin ho saktaa
 The satirical deity is used to make the cuckoos laugh
 uphaas ke liye suruchi kaa dhyaan atyant aavashyak he
 The fun in this is that the comedian should understand his errors but also be taken care of by the signer and do not see it as a preacher
 bina vyang ke haas ko parihaas samajhie, chaahe vah varnanaatmak ho chaahe vaartalap kii koti kaa or apane par athwa anya par, visheshat: anya par, vyang karke jo prabhaav dikhaaya jaataa he vah uphaas he hi
 The harm generated by the use of bits, humors, parodies, etc
, which is of the order of pure satisfaction, will be called a joke
 anubhav kii drushti se hasyaras ko mriduhas kii koti kaa samajhnaa chahie yaa attas kii koti kaa
 Other categories like Hasit, Kidnapped etc
 should be taken into account
 mriduhas ke do bhi kiye ja sakate hai, ek he gupt haas jiskaa anand man hi man liya jaataa he or doosraa he sfoot haas jiskaa muskaraahat aadi ke rup main anya jan bhi darshan kar sakate hai
 Two distinctions can also be made of attahas - one is the restrained hay which is controlled by the laughing situation and the other is the amaryad hasa in which the situation is not aware of relativity
 hasya ke bhedon kaa yah vivechan sambhavat: adhik vaigyanik hoga
 Skit in the plays and the presence of the clown have created humor but have not been versatile
 subhashit ke kai shloke avashya achche ban pade hai jinamein vishay or ukti donon drushtiyon se hasya kii acchhee avatarana kii gai he
 It will not be irrelevant to give some examples
 devataaon ke sambandh kaa majaak dekhie
 The question was why did Shankar ji drink poison? The poet's answer is that bored with the condition of his family
 shankar ji kaa saanp ganesh ji ke chuuhe kii taraf jhapat rahaa he kintu swat: usapar kartikeya ji kaa mor daanv lagaae hue he
 On the other hand, the lion of Girija is keeping a watchful eye on Ganesh ji's gajamastak and Girija ji is also frantically keeping a soutiadaah from the Ganges
 samarth hokar bhi bechaare shankar ji is besangi gruhasthi se kaise paar pate, isliye uubakar jehar pi liya
 Tridev does not sleep on the bed
 jaan padataa he khatmalon se ve bhi bhaybheet ho chuke hai
 The son-in-law considers his mother-in-law a matter of essence, but still what rudeness does he expect to get his worship done or see in the following verses
 donon hi shloke paryaapt kavyagunayukt hai
 The more you analyze, the more you will enjoy: parann priy ho ki praan, isapar kavi kaa nishkarsh suniye- Raja Bhoj had announced that the one who created the new verse would get one lakh rupees in the prize, but no one was able to get the award because the meritorious courtier Pandit would repeat the new verse as soon as he heard it and thus declare it old
 kinvadanti ke anusaar kalidas ne nimna shloke sunaakar boli band kar di thi
 In the verse, the poet has claimed that the king should free the father from ninety-nine million jewels and take the evidence of the pandits on it
 yadi panditgan kahen ki yah daawa unhen vidit nahin he to phir is nae shloke kii rachana ke liye ek lakh die hi jaaen
 The "kaisa Chhakaaya" sense of it is embodied with great beauty: hindi ke virgthakaal, bhaktikaal or reetikaal praaia: padyon ke hi kaal rahe hai
 In this long period, the compositions of humor have been rare, but they have often been in the form of retail
 tulsidas ji ke ramcharimanas kaa naradamoh prasang shivvivaah prasang, parashuram prasang aadi or surdaas ji ke sursagar kaa makhanchori prasang, uddhav-gopi-samvaad prasang aadi alabatta hasya ke achche udhaaharan prastut karte hai
 The following verse of Tulsidas ji, in which a funny pinch has been made on the Shringarlalasa of Jarajarjar ascetics, is unique in its verses- birbal ke chutkule, laal bujhakkad ke latake, ghaagh or bhaddari kii sukhtiyaan, giradhar kaviry or gang ke chand, benny kaviraj ke bhadauve tathaa or bhi kai rachanaayen is kaal kii prasiddh hai
 Bharatjeevan Press published some compilation of retail comedies of this period in its "bharova collection"
 is kaal main, visheshat: daan ke prasang ko lekar, kuch maarmik rachanaayen hui hai jinaki rochakata aaj bhi kam nahin kahi ja sakati
 See example - ek sum ne sankat main tuladaan karnaa kabool kar liya tha
 For that, look at his tricks to lose weight - vartmaan kaal main hasya ke vishyon or unki abhivyakti karne kii shaileyon kaa bahut vistaar hua he
 In this era, along with poetry, many genres of prose have also developed
 pramukh hai naatak tathaa ekanki, upanyaas tathaa kahaniyaan, evam niabandh
 In all these genres, abundant literature is written and is being written to suit the humor
 pratibhashali lekhakon ne padya ke saath hi gadhy kii vividh vidhaon main bhi apni hasyarasvardhini rachanaayen prastut kii hai
 The most famous litterateur of the early days of this era is Bharatendu Babu Harishchandra
 inke naatakon main vishuddh hasyaras kam, vagvaidagdhya kuch adhik or uphaas paryaapt maatra main paaya jaataa he
 "vaidiki Violence Violence Na Bhavati", "andhar Nagri" etc
 are his creations
 unka "chuuran kaa lataka" prasiddh he
 Lala Srinivasa Das, Shri Pratapnarayan Mishra, Shri Radhakrishnadas, Shri Prem Dhan, Shri Balakrishna Bhatt, etc
 of his era have also composed comedies
 shri pratapanarayan mishra ne "kalikauthuk roopak" naamak sundar prahasan likhaa he
 His poem titled "budhapa" is a masterpiece of pure humor
 us samay angreji rajya apane gaurav par tha jisaki pratyaksh aalochana khatre se khaali nahin thi
 Therefore, litterateurs, especially satire and derision were the way to go and tried to awaken the reformist social consciousness through sipa, hajo, quibble, satire etc
 bhaaratendu kaal ke baad mahaviraprasad dvivedi kaal aayaa jisane hasya ke vishyon or unki abhivyanjana pranaaliyon kaa kuch or adhik parishkar evam vistaar kiya
 In plays, an antecedent or epithet that accompanies the main story only for the purpose of humor was often exhausted in the Dwivedi period, and the subject was no longer necessary for the genre of humor
 kavy main "sargau narak thekana naahin" sadrush rachanaayen saraswati aadi patrikaon main saamne ai
 Balmukund Gupta and Pt
 Jagannath Prasad Chaturvedi were good writers of humor in that era
 pratham ne "bhashaa kii ansthirataa" naamak apni lekhamala "atmaram" naam se likhi or duusare sajjan ne "nirankushta-nidarshan" naamak lekhamala "mansaram" naam se
 Both of them have clashed with Dwivedi in these garlands and his discussion of this idea remained for a long time among the literati
 shri balmukund gupt ji kaa "shivashambhu kaa chittha", shri chandradhar sharma guleri kaa "kachuva dharm", shri mishrabandhu or badrinath bhatta ji ke anek naatak, shri harishankar sharma ke niabandh, naatak aadi, shri ji

 Pt
 Vishwambharnath Sharma Kaushik is certainly well-known in this field by writing letters of Vijayanand Dubey etc
 shivapujan sahay or hajariprasad dvivedi ne "hasyaras ke sahitya kii acchhee shrivriddhi kii he
 We can call Annapurnanand Verma the special writer of humor
 unke "mahakavi chachcha", "meri hazaamat," "magan rahu chola", mangal mod", "man mayur" sabhi suruchipurna hai
 In the present period, Upendranath Ashk has written many new ideas like "lift the curtain, drop the curtain" etc
 dow ramkumar verma kaa ekanki sangrah "rimjhim" is kshetra main mile kaa pathar mana gaya he
 He has given good samples of smite humor
 devraj dinesh, udaishankar bhatta, bhagwaticharan verma, prabhakar machave, jayanath nalin, bedab banarsi, kantanath chonch, bhaiya ji banarsi, gopalprasad vyas, kaaka haathrasi, shrilaal shukla aadi anek sajjanon ne anek vidhaon main rachanaayen kii hai or hasyaras ke sahitya ko khub samrudh kiya he
 Many of these authors have received good praise from many works

 Many specific works of other languages have also been translated into Hindi

 In many countries, conservation laws have been enacted to protect dependent species: for example, prohibition of hunting, land development or restrictions on the construction of protected sites
 Of the many species likely to go extinct, only a few actually enter this list and receive legal protection
 kai prajatiyaan vilupt ho jaati hai, yaa bina saarvajanik ullekh ke sambhavit rup se lupt ho jaati hai
 The conservation status of a species is an indicator of survival of those endangered species

 The term Endangered Species is used as a specific category of risk in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species
 IUCN varg or mandandon ke adheen luptpraaya prajati, gambhir rup se sankatagrast or asurakshit ke bich main he
 In addition, a critically endangered species can also be counted as an endangered species and fill all criteria

 IUCN categories include: sanyukt rajya america main luptpraaya prajati adhinium ke antargat, do shreniyon main "luptpraaya" adhik sangrakshit he
 The Salt Creek tiger beetle is an example of a subspecies protected under the ESA
 akele sanyukt rajya america main, "vilupt hone ke khatare vaali gyaat prajatiyon kii sankhya luptpraaya prajati adhinium ke tahat sangrakshit sankhya se das guna adhik he" 
 america machhlee or vanya-jeev seva or saath hi, rashtriya samudri matsay seva ko luptpraaya prajatiyon ke vargeekaran or sangrakshan ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa he, tathaapi, suchi main kisi vishisht prajati ko jodna, kaafii lambii, vivaadaaspad prakriya he or vastav main yah jokhim vaale vanaspati or praani jivan ke keval ek ansh kaa hi pratinidhitiv karata he 
 The laws of some endangered species have been controversial

 Under the Bush administration, the previous policy of consulting wildlife experts was lifted before federal authorities took action to harm endangered species
 obama prashasan ke tahat, is niti ko punah behaal kiya gaya he
 Listing as an endangered species can have a negative effect, as it may make the species more desirable to collectors and predators in particular
 is prabhaav ko sambhavit rup se kam kiya ja saktaa he, jaise ki china main vyavsaayik rup se kachhue utpann karne se, shikaar ke prati sankatagrast prajatiyon par dabaav kuch kam ho rahaa he
 Another problem with the listed species is its effect on provoking the use of a 'shoot, throw and shut up' approach to clear endangered species from the ground
 samprati kuch zamin maalik, apni zamin par luptpraaya jaanavar ke paae jane ke baad uski qeemat main kami anubhav karte hai
 He has reportedly opted to quietly kill and bury animals or destroy their habitat, in order to diagnose the problem from his land, but at the same time, the population of endangered species also decreases

 Nineteen species have been removed and recovered from the list, and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have recalcitrant or stable populations
 is samay, duniya main 1,556 gyaat prajatiyon kii vilupt hone ke rup main pahchaan kii gai he or ve sarkari kaanoon dwaara suraksha ke tahat hai
 This approximation, however, does not take into account the number of species endangered, including those under the protection of laws such as the Endangered Species Act

 yah kul sankhya sanyukt rajya america main luptpraaya prajati adhinium ke tahat sangrakshit prajatiyon kii sankhya se adhik he, jiskaa arth he ki kai prajatiyaan dhire-dhire vilopan ke qareeb hoti ja rahi hai
 Even in the case of discovering to know more about these species, many ecologists do not consider their impact on the environment and the inhabitants
 yah spasht he ki "paristhitiki gyaan kaa anveshan, jo moolyawaan paristhitiki tantra kii sampatti or sevaaon ke saath-saath prithvi kii jaev vividhta ke sangrakshan ke bare main samajhane ke prayaason ke suchnarth bahut mahatvapurn he, aksar jatil naitik sawaal uthaata he", or in muddon ko pahchaanane or unhen sulajhane ke liye koi spasht rasta nahin he
 Environmentalists focus on the overall ecological field, rather than on the welfare of individual animals
 aise vyapak drushtikon par dhyaan kendrit karne se prayek vyaktigat praani kaa mulya ghat jaataa he
 "presently, biodiversity conservation is the basic goal for resource management of 11
5% of the world's surface area
 jivan kaa adhikansh bhaag in sangrakshit kshetron se baahar aata he or yadi luptpraaya prajatiyon kaa sangrakshan prabhavi hona he, to un par vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 To conserve the biodiversity of the planet, we have to consider why many species are becoming extinct
 "america main awaas nuksaan prajatiyon ke sankatagrast hone kaa sabase vyapak kaaran he, jo jokhim vaali prajatiyon main 85% ko prabhavit karata he" 
 jab kisi jaanavar ke paristhitiki tantra kaa anurakshan nahin hota he, ve apana ghar kho baithte hai or nae parivesh ko apnaane yaa nasht hone ke liye majaboor ho jate hai
 Pollution is another factor that causes endangered species of many species, especially large quantities of aquatic organisms
 iske alaava, atishoshan, beemaari or jalwaayu parivartan ke kaaran kai prajatiyaan luptpraaya hui hai
 Nonetheless, the major critical factor causing most endangered wildlife in the world is human impact on the species and their environment
 "pichhali kuch sadiyon se maanvon dwaara sansaadhan, urja or sthalon ke upyog main tezi ai he, duniya ke adhikansh bhaagon main jaev vividhta main paryaapt rup se hraas hua he" 
 multah, paryaavaran par jaise-jaise maanav kaa prabhaav badhata he, jivan kii vividhta ghatati jaati he
 People are constantly using resources and landmarks of other species for themselves, which is negatively affecting the survival rate of many organisms
 log apane maanak bhi tay karte hai ki kin prajatiyon ko bachaaya janaa chahie or koun-si prajatiyaan unke liye mahatvaheen yaa avaanchhneeya hai
 Cocky frogs, the invasive species of Hawaii, for example, are so common there that their 'night songs' reduce house prices and prevent hotels from using rooms near forests
 hawaii ke logon ne mendhak ko nasht karne kaa prastaav kiya he or kai vanya jeev prabandhakon ne mendhako ko maarane ke liye ek rogajanak chhodane kaa prastaav rakhaa he 
 mendhak ne gharon kii keematen kam kii hai or kai hotalon ke vyapaar ko kshati pahunchaai he, isliye hawaii ke logon ne faisalaa liya he ki unke nikat rahane vaale cockey mendhakon ke samooh se chhutkaaraa paanaa unhen sweekaarya he
 Another example where human influence has affected the well-being of a species' sex is the non-native mute swan that resides in Arrowhead Lake, Vermont
 When the swan population grew to eight birds, Vermont's Department of Fisheries and Wildlife decided to take action
 antat do hanson ko maar daalaa gaya, jisase pashu kalyaan sanghathan or jhil ke paas rahane vaale log krodhit hue 
 arohed jhil ke hanson kaa maamla yah darshata he ki maanav manyataon ke aadhaar par prakritik parivesh par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Just because the swans did not reside there naturally does not mean that they are not part of their natural habitat and certainly only human dissatisfaction does not cause them to be destroyed
 luptpraaya prajatiyon ke jivan main maanav prabhaav kaa ek or udhaaharan he preble ghaas ke maidaanon main fudakane vaale chuuhe
 anusandhanon se pataa chalaa he ki chuuhe, bear loj fudakane vaale chuhon se vargikeey rup se alag nahin he or america matsay or vanya-jeev seva ne is soochna ke aadhaar par luptpraaya prajatiyon kii suchi se preble chuuhe ko hataane kaa prastaav rakhaa he 
 yah udhaaharan prajati ke anurakshan ke nirdhaaran main vigyaan kii bhoomika ko vichaaradhin laata he
 This raises the question whether only scientific evidence should be used as a resource in support of conservation of biodiversity
 maujuuda prajatiyon par maanav prabhaav kaa ek antim udhaaharan, paryaavaran anusandhan main pair ke anguuthe ke kataran kaa mudda he
 While ecologists are doing research on different species to further their knowledge of conservation methods, the effect on the wildlife they are studying should also be considered
 Toe clipping "has been reported to result in adverse effects on animals including inflammation and infection in the legs and limbs"
 This example shows how people should also consider the well being of animals before doing research to help in the conservation of the species
 Human impact has a very negative effect on species and their environment
 logon ke liye yah mahatvapurn he ki duniya main sabhi prajatiyon ke anurakshan or unke vikaas ko baadhit naa karne main madad karen
 "diversity of life and life systems is an essential condition for the development of human life"
 Many question the importance of maintaining biodiversity in today's world, where conservation efforts prove costly and which take a lot of time
 tathy yah he ki maanav astitv ke liye sabhi prajatiyon kaa sangrakshan aavashyak he
 To species "for aesthetic and moral justification; the importance of wild species as a provider of products and services necessary for human welfare; the value of specific species as environmental health indicators or the importance of the root element species for the functioning of ecosystems
" ; And scientific breakthroughs achieved by the study of wildlife "
 
 In other words, species serve as sources of arts and entertainment, providing products such as medicine for the good of humans, signaling the well-being of the overall environment and ecology, and providing research, resulting in possible scientific discovery Are possible
 luptpraaya prajatiyon ke sangrakshan ke "saundaryaparak auchity" kaa ek udhaaharan he, ellostone rashtriya udyaan main bhure bhediye kaa pravesh

 maanav kii bhalaai ke liye utpaadon ke pradaata ke rup main luptpraaya prajatiyon ke sangrakshan ke samarthan kaa ek anya udhaaharan he, scrub mint
 yah paaya gaya he ki scrub mint main kavkarodhi kaarak or prakritik kitnashak maujuud he
 In addition, the downfall of bald vulture and deaf hawk "alerted people to the potential health hazards associated with widespread spraying of DDT and other permanent pesticides"
 yah ek drushtaant ke rup main karata he ki kaise koi machhlee paryaavarniya swasthya kii pahchaan karaane vaale ghatak ke rup main madadgaar ho sakati he or maanav jivan tathaa anya prajatiyon kii raksha kar sakati he
 Finally, an example of a species helpful in scientific discoveries is Pacific U, which "became the source of textiles, the most potent anti-cancer compound of all time"
 Endangered species can prove useful in human development, maintenance of biodiversity and conservation of ecosystems
 sangrakshan karne waalon kaa lakshya he, luptpraaya prajatiyon kaa sangrakshan or jaev vividhta ke anurakshan ke liye tareeqe bananaa or unka vistaar karnaa
 duniya kii vilupt hone ja rahi prajatiyon ke sangrakshan main, kai tareeqon se sahaayta kii ja sakati he
 One of these methods is to obtain more information about different groups of species, particularly about invertebrates, fungi and marine organisms, where there is a lack of sufficient data
 udhaaharan ke liye, aabaadi main giravat or vilopan ke kaarnon ko samajhane ke liye, finland main titliyon kii aabaadi par ek prayog kiya gaya
 In this analysis, records were recorded and tested in relation to the threatened list classification of butterflies, distribution, density, conceit specificity, transmission capacity, adult natural habitat, flight duration and body size, so that each species' peril Status can be determined
 It was found that the distribution of butterflies has declined by fifty-one and a half percent and their habitat is severely restricted
 vishisht titliyon ke vitaran dar main giravat kaa ek udhaaharan he, frigga kaa fritilleri or grizald skipper, jo daldal ke vyapak nikasi ke falswaroop unke prakritik-vaas kshatigrast hone ke kaaran prabhavit hue hai
 
 This experiment proves that when we are aware of the causes of risk, we can successfully devise solutions for biodiversity management
 luptpraaya prajatiyon ke sangrakshan main madad kaa ek anya tareeqa he, paryaavarniya naitikta ko samarpit ek nae vyavsaayik samaaj kaa nirmaan
 isse paristhiti-vigyaniyon ko jaev vividhta ke anusandhan or prabandhan main naitik nirnay lene main madad mil sakati he
 In addition, creating greater awareness on environmental ethics can help encourage species conservation
 "chaatro ke liye naitikta paathyakram or paristhiti-vigyaniyon or jaev vividhta prabandhakon ke liye prashikshan kaaryakramon" se paryaavaran sambandhi jaagrukta paidaa ho sakati he or anusandhan tathaa prabandhan main aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ko roka ja saktaa he

 In 1969, a directive was issued to celebrate Sanskrit Day at the central and state level by order of the Ministry of Education, Government of India
 tab se sampurna bharat main sanskrit diwas shravan poornima ke din manaaya jaataa he
 This day was chosen because the teaching session started in ancient India on this day
 isi din veda paath kaa aarambh hota tha tathaa isi din chaatr shastron ke adhyayan kaa prarambh kiya karte the
 From the full moon of Pausha month to the full moon day of Shravan, the study was closed
 pracheen kaal main phir se shravan poornima se pus poornima tak adhyayan chalata tha, vartmaan main bhi gurukulon main shravan poornima se vedadhyayan prarambh kiya jaataa he
 That is why this day is celebrated as Sanskrit Day

 acha ho ki jis shubh din ko vivaah-sanskaar hona he, us din praatavkaal yagyopavit dhaaran kaa kram vyavasthit dhang se kara diya jaae
 It is strange to wear a Yajnopavit after removing the clothes etc
 of the bride dressed for the marriage ceremony
 isliye usko pehle hi puraa kar liya jaae
 If that is not possible, then the Yagyopaveet is put on reception

 Where there is a ritual of Dwarachar before the main rites at the traditional wedding ceremonies at the family level, if it is possible to make the atmosphere of the halls appropriate for the rites, then the cases of reception and clothing and flowers can be completed at that time also

 Surpaitevadi is a village in Almora district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Almoda tehsil
 ghasiram kotwaal vijay tendulkar dwaara likhit marathi naatak he
 This is the story of the tragedy of Ghasiram, a Hindi-speaking Brahmin who went to Poona, a stronghold of Brahmins in search of employment
 brahmanon se apamaanit ghasiram maratha peshwa naanaa fadanbis se apni beti ke vivaah kaa sauda karata he or puna kii kotwali hasil kar un brahmanon se badla letaa he
 But Nana kills his daughter
 ghasiram chaahakar bhi iskaa badla nahin le paata
 On the contrary, Nana kills him
 is naatak ke mul marathi swaroop kaa pehali baar pradarshan 16 disambar, 1972 ko puna main ‘progressive dramatik association’ dwaara bharat natya mandir main hua
 The director was Dr
 Jabbar Patel
 ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ aitihaasik naatak nahin he
 It is a drama, only a drama! a drama is only a drama
 ek saahitiyik kalakriti ke sandarbh main yah kahana ki vah aitihaasik he, yaa puranic he, yaa saamaajik he, bemaani he
 Time too quickly turns social into historical and historical to mythological
 phir bhi is naatak kii saamagree-kaccha masala-itihaas se batori gai he
 a weak basis of history is definitely taken
 par, iske aage naatak kaa itihaas se koi sambandh nahin he
 And this raw spice is also taken from history in the same way as it is taken from contemporary life-situations
 maharashtra main peshwaon kaa raaj tha, naanaa fadanvis peshwa ke pradhan the, koi ek ghasiram tha, brahman the, maratha sardaar the or ve sab ikaiyaan apane-apane daayre main bandhi samay ke pravaah main lakdi ke latthe kii bhanti kabhi satakar to kabhi hatakar, kabhi paraspar ko chooti to kabhi takaraati apratihat pravaahit ho rahi thim
 It may be the job of a person who researches history, not the playwright, to investigate whether his work was appropriate or improper or his basic existence was meaningful
 main isi kaaran ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ ko anaitihaasik naatak maanata hoon
 'ghasiram Kotwal' is a legend, a legend, a legend
 or dantakatha kaa ek apana rachana-vidhaan hota he: jhine yatharth ko jab ham apni naitikta se ranjit kar kalpana kii sahaayta se punarujjivit karte hai to ek dantakatha ban jaati he
 There is also a story of gossip and if there is a sight to behold then it is a dahik experience daahak anubhav hi rachanaatmak sahitya ban paata he, isamen koi sandeh nahin he
 But what is a legend and how is it, what matters more is how we take it, because then we do our investigation
 jaahir he ki yahi kaam sabase mushkil hota he, ek gahari chunauti he vah
 To accept it is to show our literature-loyalty
 meri nigaah main ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ ek vishisht samaaj-sthiti kii ore sanket karata he
 That social condition is neither old nor new
 na vah kisi bhugolic seemaa-rekha main bandhi he, na samay se hi
 That place is timeless, so 'ghasiram' and 'nana Phadnavis' are also place-timeless
 samaaj-sthitiyaan unhen janm detii hai, detii rahengi
 The playwright of any era will not be able to remain untouched by them
 apni prakruti ke anusaar vah kabhi bhavy-bheeshan rup dekar unhen manch par utaaregaa to kabhi nrity-sangitamay banaakar prastut karegaa
 i have deliberately adopted another method
 lokanaty kaa lacheelaapan vikhyath he or dantakatha ke prastutikaran ke liye sabase adhik upyogi he
 In it, a character emerges as a representative of a specific mindset and that attitude is very direct and complete and unmatched
 satahi sanshlishtataa ke rahete hue bhi vah aam darshak ke saamne baraabar ujagar hokar rahati he
 Apart from this, he also has his own devotion, which incarnates itself at the level of language and spectacle
 lokanaty kii is vishistataa ko main kyon chhod detaa ? But the creator should not speak much about his creation, the composition speaks for itself and the same is true
 vijay tendulkar In this play, Tendulkar has portrayed the social and political situation of the erstwhile social and political situation in his own specific style along with this struggle, despite Ghasiram and Nana Fadnavis being the main people-struggle
 parinamat: sattadhari varg or jansadharan kii sampoorn sthiti par kaal-avasthaapan ke antar se vishesh vaastavik antar nahin padataa
 Ghasiram is in every age and society, and in that period and in that society, there is a chance to make him like that and to kill him as well as Nana Phadnavis - that is what Tendulkar has proposed in his own way
 naanaa ne ghasiram kaa upyog badi dhoortta se kiya he
 But when their 'demon' is created and starts to challenge them, the maternal grandfather also destroys him
 is drushti se yah naatak naanaa fadanvis kaa hi he, isamen shaq nahin
 Ghasiram is, in a way, a mere matter which Tendulkar has made, a means for the expression of his statement
 ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ naatak main naanaa fadanvis or tatkaaleen patanonmukh samaaj ke chithran dwaara kuch raajnneetik or vishesh saamaajik sthitiyon ke vishay main tendulkar ko kuch satya ujagar karne hai, jo sanathan ho gaye hai
 Nana Fadnavis of history is reputed to be a power tormented by intellectual brilliance
 kintu is naatak main keval ghasiram kotwaal ke prasang kii seemaa main ghire hone ke kaaran unka vyaktitv ikharaa dikhaai padataa he, uske duusare aayam saamne nahin aate
 Indirectly, Tendulkar has used it in the same way as in folk plays where characters are usually of one or two dimensions
 isiilie ek prasiddh marathi sameekshak ne is naatak ko bahut kuch parmparik bhartiya natya-rup uparupak jaisaa bataaya he
 i have considered this same thing in my presentation as the central formula
 naatak dekhte samay darshakon ke man main anjaane hi yah baat utarati jaani chahie ki saare-kaa-sara samaaj hi dhah rahaa he, chuk rahaa he
 This conversation should not be indirect
 is naatak kii rachana marathi rangamanch ke liye ekadam nai hone ke kaaran uske abhipret arth ko manachaahi apratyaksh paddati se vyakt karne main mujhe badi suvidha hui
 No reputed playwright had previously molded a play in the form of folklore, so i was able to use the flexible elastic craft of Loknataka in many ways
 aadamiyon ke jhulate parade kii kalpana rangamanch ke liye adbhut he
 This is also the biggest tip of this drama
 baarah brahman kores ke rup main katha-pravaah sanbhaalate hai
 They also play immediate single roles as required
 yah paradaa do khandon main bantataa he or kshan-bhar main samaaj ke kai-kai ghatakon, icaayiyon ke praturup main dhal jaataa he
 The same curtain, which establishes Ghasiram as Kotwal, is seen in the theater as angry Brahmins during the slaughter of Ghasiram
 shri gajraj nartan karain gaanevaala yahi paradaa ganpati-vandana dwaara lokanaty se apana sambandh jodta he
 a subtle and level relationship between the artist and the role is characteristic of Loknatya
 maine apane pradarshan ko kisi vishesh lokastyle main nahin bandha varan dashavathar, bharud, khelaa, tamaasha, powada, vaadhyamurali, kirthan aadi shuddh marathi lokkalaon kaa mishrit upyog kiya he
 Dasavatari starts by Saraswati, Lakshmi, Ganapati
 is samay kii aarti ke thaal ko hi baad main kirthan ke samay kaale tike ke liye upyog kar in vibhinn shaileyon main samya dikhaane kaa maine praytn kiya he
 Brahmin-dressed artists come to the theater through the auditorium
 is prakaar atmiyata utpann hone ke kaaran pradarshan kaa lokanaty-rup darshakon ke maansik str tak adhikadhik sampreshit ho jaataa he
 The pace of the first issue of the play is slower than the second
 lok natya ke bahya swaroop main aitihaasik vyakti ko sthapit hone main samay laganaa swaabhaavik hi he kyonki vah sarvatha nayaa anubhav he
 History-men like Nana Phadnavis coming to the theater dancing-rhythmic was definitely a shocking experience for the Marathi audience
 isliye darshak ko is baat kaa vishwaas dilaanaa tha ki is naatak kaa paatr naanaa fadanvis ek loknatakeey charitra maatr he-aitihaasik naatakon kaa pramanik, sampoorn vyaktitv nahin
 In the view of some reviewers, this was established very slowly
 kintu mujhe laga ki khokhale samaaj ko nirdeshit kar usamen naanaa ke sthaan or kotwali hasil karne ke liye ghasiram dwaara naanaa ke upyog kii prakriya aadi kaa digdarshan vistaarpurn hona hi chahie tha
 The pace of the second digit was fast
 puna ke brahmanon par atyaachaar karanevaala ghasiram, uskaa pratishodh, us pratishodh ke kaaran ghasiram kaa rakshas main roopaantarit hona, aadi agnipariksha ke drishy tak jaakar sthapit hota he
 From Nana's marriage to Gauri's death Ghasiram is very restless but his restlessness is that of Naradham
 vah brahmanon ko kothri main ghont kar maarna nahin chahta tha lekin naradham ghasiram kii hatya uske apratyaksh aparaadh kaa hi fal he-niyati ke is virodhabhas ko tendulkar ne prabhaavshaalee dhang se nirupit kiya he
 Such a vengeance of destiny is found in the context of many historical villains
 ghasiram kii hatya ke baad naanaa kaa chaturaai-bharaa bhaashan dhurttata or kootneeti se purna hone ke kaaran unke prabhutv kaa vilakshan prabhaav utpann karata he or naanaa fadanvis pun: naatak ke kendra main aa jate hai
 The English character of this drama is a mere spectator
 naatak ke ant main vah pichhali chaowkee par bain ore prakashvritt main khadaa he
 The mass celebration is taking place after the murder of Ghasiram below
 yah puna ke bhavi itihaas kaa mahatvapurn purvabhaas he
