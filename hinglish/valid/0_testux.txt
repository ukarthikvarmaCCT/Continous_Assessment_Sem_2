 Anarchy is an ideal whose principle is anarchism
 araajaktaavaad rajya ko samaapt kar vyaktiyon, samoohon or rashtron ke bich swatantra or sahaj sahyog dwaara samast maanviya sambandhon main nyaay sthapit karne ke prayatnon kaa siddhant he
 According to anarchism, freedom is the dynamic rule of life and hence it is intended that social organization should provide maximum opportunities for the freedom of work of individuals
 maanviya prakruti main aatmaniyaman kii aisi shakti he jo bahya niyantran se mukt rahane par sahaj hi suvyavastha sthapit kar sakati he
 The imposition of discipline on man is the father of social and moral evils
 isliye hinsa par ashrith rajya tathaa uski anya sansthaayen in buraaiyon ko dur nahin kar saktin
 Man is naturally good, but these institutions corrupt the human being
 bahya niyantran se mukt, vaastavik swatantraaa kaa sahyogi samuhik jivan pramukh reeti se chote samoohon se sambhav he; isliye saamaajik sanghathan kaa adarsh sanghavaadi he
 The credit for the first formulation of the theory of anarchism in a systematic way is attributed to Zeno, the originator of the Stoic ideology
 usne rajyarahit aise samaaj kii sthapana par jor diya jahaan nirpeksh samanta evam swatantraaa maanviya prakruti kii satpravritiyon ko suviksit kar saarvbhaum saamanjasy sathapit kar sake
 In the middle of the second century, the philanthropist of the communist form of anarchism, Carpocrates, spoke of the abolition of private property in addition to the state
 madhyayug ke uttarardh main isai darshanikon tathaa samudaayon ke vichaaron or sanghathan main kuch spasht araajaktaavaadi pravritiyaan vyakt huin jinka mukhya aadhaar yah daawa tha ki vyakti ishwar se sidhaa rahasyatmak sambandh sthapit kar papamukt ho saktaa he
 In the modern sense, anarchist theory was systematically presented by William Godwin, according to which government and private property are the two evils which hamper the attainment of natural perfection of mankind
 dusron ko adhinsth karne kaa saadhan hone ke kaaran sarkaar nirankushta kaa swaroop he or shoshan kaa saadhan hone ke kaaran nijee sampatti krur anyaay
 But Godwin described not all property as bad, but only property that helps exploitation
 adarsh saamaajik sanghathan kii sthapana ke liye usne hinsaatmak krantikari sadhano ko anuchit tehraaya
 Only by propagating the ideal of justice can one bring that consciousness to the person so that he can cooperate in establishing the ideal anarchist contractual system of small local units
 iske baad do vichaardhaaraon ne vishesh rup se araajaktaavaadi siddhant ke vikaas main yoga diya
 One was the ideology of extreme individualism, represented by Herbert Spencer
 in vichaarkon ke anusaar swatantraaa or satta main virodh he or rajya ashubh hi nahin, anaavashyak bhi he
 But these thinkers were certainly not in favor of abolition of private property nor against organized religion
 duusari vichaardhaara fuarabaakh ke darshan se sambandhit thi jisane sangathit dharm tathaa rajya ke parbhautik aadhaar kaa virodh kiya
 In line with Fuerbach's revolutionary ideas, Max Sterner called society only a girl and firmly stated that man's own personality is a reality that can be known
 vaiyaktikta par seemayen nirdhaarit karanevaale sabhi niyam ahan ke swasth vikaas main baadhak hai
 If there is a "union of egoists" in place of the state, then economic exploitation will be eradicated in the ideal system, because the main output of society will be the result of independent cooperation
 kranti ke sambandh main uskaa yah mat tha ki hinsa par ashrith rajya kaa unmoolan hinsa dwaara hi ho saktaa he
 Prudh is responsible for making anarchism a conscious mass movement
 usne sampatti ke ekadhikaar tathaa uske anuchit swaamitv kaa virodh kiya
 The ideal social organization is one that provides "freedom in the system and freedom in unity"
 is lakshya kii prapti ke liye do moulik krantiyaan aavashyak hai : ek kaa sanchaalan vartmaan aarthik vyavastha ke viruddh tathaa duusare kaa vartmaan rajya ke viruddh ho
 But in any case, revolution should not be violent, but emphasis should be on the economic freedom and moral development of the person
 antat: prudhon ne sweekaar kiya ki rajya ko purnroopen samaapt nahin kiya ja saktaa, isliye araajaktaavaad kaa mukhya uddeshy rajya ke kaaryon ko vikendrit karnaa tathaa swatantra samuhik jivan dwaara use jahaan tak sambhav ho, kam karnaa chahie
 Bakunin not only added some new trends to modern anarchism, but also gave it a collectivist form
 usne bhoomi tathaa utpaadan ke anya sadhano ke samuhik swaamitv par jor dene ke saath-saath upbhog kii vastuon ke nijee swaamitv ko bhi sweekaar kiya
 His idea has three foundations: anarchism, atheism and the principle of voluntary cooperation among the independent classes
 falat: vah rajya, carch or nijee sampatti, in teenon sansthaaon kaa virdohi he
 According to him, the present society is divided into two classes: the affluent class which holds the state power, and the elite class who are deprived of land, capital and education, are subject to the autocracy of the first class, so are also deprived of freedom
 samaaj main prayek ke liye swatantraaa-prapti anivaary he
 For this, all forms of power that subordinate others will have to be boycotted
 ishwar or rajya aisi hi do sattayen hai
 One is based on the principle of supreme power in the otherworldly world and the other in the cosmic world
 carch pehle siddhant kaa matrt rup he
 Therefore, the anti-state revolution should also be anti-church
 saath hi, rajya sadaiv nijee sampatti kaa poshak he, isliye yah kranti nijee sampattivirdohi bhi ho
 In connection with the revolution, Bakounin expressed his confidence in violent means
 kranti kaa pramukh uddeshy in teenon sansthaaon kaa vinaash bataaya gaya he, parantu nae samaaj kii rachana ke vishay main kuch nahin kaha gaya
 Because of the immense belief in the tendency of cooperation of man, Bakunin had the idea that human society would free itself from the superstition of God, corruption of the state and exploitation of private property, to make its own healthy organization
 kranti ke sambandh main uskaa vichaar tha ki use jansadharan kii sahaj kriyaaon kaa pratifal hona chahie
 At the same time, he added terrorist theory to anarchism by placing excessive emphasis on violence
 pichhali shatabdi ke uttarardh main araajaktaavaad ne adhik se adhik samyavaadee rup apanaaya he
 Kropatkin, the leader of this movement, emphasized complete communism
 parantu saath hi usne janakranti dwaara rajya ko vinisht karne kii baat kahkar sattarudh samyawad ko amaanya tehraaya
 For the revolution, he also considered it appropriate to use violent means
 adarsh samaaj main koi raajnneetik sanghathan na hoga, vyakti or samaaj kii kriyaaon par janamat kaa niyantran hoga
 Public opinion is effective in small units of the population, so the ideal society will be the society of the villages
 aropit sanghathan kii koi aavashyaktaa na hogi kyonki aisa samaaj purnroopen naitik vidhaan ke anuroop hoga
 Instead of the institution relying on violence, the ideal society would be the basis of voluntary associations and communities and their organization would develop from below
 sabase neeche swatantra vyaktiyaan ke samudaay, commune honge, commune ke sangh praant or praant ke sangh raashtra honge
 The Union of Nations will form the European United Nations and eventually the World United Nations

 The US Congress meets in Washington DC, the capital of the USA
 'congress' laathini shabd he jiskaa arth "saath aana" he
 The term congress was first used in the 17th century
 jab kisi desh ke samrat yaa uske purnashaktipraapt mahadoot kisi gambhir antarrashtriya samasya kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye kritasankalp hokar sammilit hote hai tab aisi sabha ko congress kehete hai
 The circle of scholars can also be called Congress

 The Constitution of the United States of America is the federal constitution
 is samvidhan main shaktisantulan evam adhikarvibhaajan ke siddhant ko manyata di gai he
 The framers of the constitution have placed the legislative power of the United States under a Congress, which has two houses called the Senate and the House of Representatives
 rashtriya canavension main atyadhik matbhed rahaa he
 In the end, the framers of the Constitution, showing their practical skills, decided that the organization of the House of Representatives should be organized on a national basis and that the Senate should be organized with a view to maintaining the spirit of independent existence of the Sanghas
 at: sinet evam house ov riprexantatives kaa sammilit rup hi congress he
 The framers of the Constitution have given due place to the spirit of freedom of the Confederates in the organization of the Senate and the spirit of national unity in the organization of the House of Representatives
 is prakaar congress ke sanghathan main virdohi bhaawanaaon kaa sundar samanvay dikhalaai padataa he
 The United States named the federal legislature Congress because the term signifies federal government
 yah satya he ki saadharantaya congress ke sanghathan evam adhikaron main bahut hi kam parivartan hua he
 The present Congress is fully aware of what the Constitutional framers had envisioned regarding the organization and rights of the Congress
 sinet evam house ov riprexantatives ke pratinidhiyon kaa nirvachan janata dwaara pratyaksh nirvachan se hoga
 Every female male over 21 years of age in the United States has the right to vote in an election
 sinet ke sadasyon kii yogyata yah he : kam se kam 30 varsh kii vay kaa ho, nau baras kii sanyukt rajya kii naagarikta ho tathaa us rajya kaa nivasee ho jisase vah chunaa janevaala ho
 Members of the House of Representatives have this qualification: be at least 25 years old, have seven years of United States citizenship and be a resident of the federal state from which they are to be elected
 sinet ke sadasyon kaa karykaal chah baras ke liye nirdhaarit he
 But one third of the new members are elected every second year
 sanyukt rajya kii sinet kaa nirmaan prayek rajya ke do-do pratinidhiyon se hota he jo uski janata dwaara chah varsh ke liye chune jo hai
 The House of Representatives is the more representative House of the United States Legislature
 house ov riprexantatives ke sadasyon kii sankhya sanghantarit rajya kii aabaadi ke anusaar nirdhaarit kii gai he, arthath 3,00,000 vyaktiyon ke peeche ek pratinidhi chunaa jaataa he
 But it is also a condition that at least one representative of each federal state must be elected
 is prakaar sanghavaad ke siddhant ke anusaar prayek sanghantarit rajya kaa samaan pratinidhitiv aavashyak tha
 Hence this principle has been formulated in the organization of the Senate and symbolizes the unity of the House of Representatives and the entire nation
 saadharantaya yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aise rashtriya vishyon ke adhikaar jinka samvidhan main ullekh nahin he or jo congress ke liye varjit nahin he, congress ke donon sadanon ko samaan rup se praapt hai
 But there are also some rights which have been given to only one house by not giving both of its houses
 at: congress ke adhikaron kaa adhyayan teen kshetron main kiya ja saktaa he house ov riprexantatives ke visheshadhikaar, sinet ke visheshadhikaar tathaa congress ke adhikaar
 The privileges of the House of Representatives are as follows: sinet ke visheshadhikaar hai: In addition to the privileges described in both houses of Congress, there are some rights which are equally enjoyed by both the houses and both the houses together exercise them under the Constitution
 ye adhiktar nimnlikhit hai : Congress rights are not prescriptive
 "congress in vishyon par vidhi bana sakegi' aise shabdon kaa prayog samvidhan main kiya gaya he
 It is clear from the above description that the Congress is not merely an institution of legal construction
 yah samvidhannirmaataa he tathaa karypalika evam nyaaypalika sambandhi bhi kuch adhikaar ise praapt hai
 Looking roughly, it is known that the rights of both buildings are the same
 prayek vidheyak kaa donon bhawanon main paarit hona aavashyak he
 In order to keep the spirit of democracy alive, it is absolutely necessary that the introduction of Money Bills in the House of Representatives
 prajatantr pranali main nishtha rakhanevaale sabhi deshon main yah parampara he ki dhan vidheyak tathaa vaarshik aay vyay ke byore ke liye pratham sadan hi adhik adhikari ho
 But compared to the other houses of the world, it can be said that the second house of the United States has proved to be very powerful and influential because on the one hand it prevents the president from becoming autocratic by his permission and authority of consultation and on the other hand It is helpful in preventing passionate and less prudent bills of ow representatives

 He also sang songs for his own role and performed playback singing for Asha
 1945main ustad ghulaam haidar apni aanevaali film ke liye lata ko ek nirmaataa ke studio le gayi jisame kamini kaushal mukhya bhoomika nibhaa rahi thi
 They wanted Lata to do playback singing for that film
 lekin gulam haidar ko niraashaa haath lagi
 In 1947, Vasant Joglekar gave Lata a chance to sing in his film Aapka Seva
 is film ke gaanon se lata kii khub charchaa hui
 Lata then strengthened her position with songs like "english Chhora Gaya" and "dil Mera Toda Hi Mujhe Kahin Ke Chhore Tere Pyaar Ne" from the film Mazaboor
 haalaanki iske baavzood lata ko us khaas hit kii abhi bhi talash thi
 In 1949 Lata got such an opportunity from the song "aayega Aanewala" from the film "mahal"
 is geet ko us samay kii sabase khubasurat or charchit abhinetri madhubala par filmaaya gaya tha
 The film was extremely successful and proved very auspicious for both Lata and Madhubala
 iske baad lata ne kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 1576 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 1576 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar
 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 1576 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he
 Lichen is a group of low grade vegetation, which are found growing on a variety of grounds
 in aadhaaron main vrikshon kii pattiyaan evam chaal, pracheen deevaaren, bhootal, chattan or shilaayein mukhya hai
 Although they are mostly white colored, lichen of red, orange, violet, blue and brown and other attractive colors are also found
 inaki vruddhi kii gati mand hoti he env inke aakaar or banaavat main bhi paryaapt bhinnata rahati he
 The vegetative body of these plants is a thallus, which is completely root, leaf and branchless
 laikenon ke samudaay ko mukhyat: teen prakaar ke thelas main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : Some flattened and raised; pattee kii bhanti, jisamen upree tathaa bhitari donon hi dharaatal paryaapt spasht hote hai evam Like a flag, which is arranged in the vertical direction
 ye teenon prakaar ke varg kramash: parptimay, parnil or kshupil likene kahe jate hai
 The fluffy lichen is flattened and thin and grows by sticking to the bark of trees, or rocks
 inamen adhikansh kaa to kuch bhaag aadhaar ke bheetar hota he or ye aadhaar par bhure rang kii dhariyon tathaa binduon kii bhanti dikhaai dete hai
 Their different species meet the base color, so they look similar to rock
 parnil likene mudi hui pattee kii bhanti hote hai, jinamein aaroh avaroh hote hai
 They stick to rocks, or branches, with the help of thin thin radiations
 mulabhas inke nichle dharaatal se nikalate hai
 The axillary lichens are highly divided into cylindrical and ribbons, which are attached to their base level as a flag by the basal part
 sabhi likene adhipadap hai, paraseete nahin
 They depend on their host only for support
 vastav main likene do purnataya bhinn vanaspatiyon se bana ek dwaidh padap hota he
 One of these flora is algae and the other is fungus, but both of them have such close association that the lichen made from them appears to be a single plant
 is saahchary main adhikanshat: kavak hi hota he, jo shaivalwale ang ke upar ek thile kii bhanti aavaran hota he tathaa thelas ke aakaar ke liye uttaradaayi hota he
 The mixed growth of both flora gives the lichen a special shape and internal structure, dividing the lichen into several clans and species
 inke lagbhag 400 vansh or 15,000 spishiz gyaat hai
 The main part of lichen is made of fungal fibers, which are made of a mesh of fibers
 yah jaali praaia: ascomicitis varg ke kavak kaa vanaspatik bhaag hoti he
 Some of the fungi also belong to the genus Basidiomycetes
 likene ke upree str main in kavak tantuon se mishrit hare rang kii jo chlorophisi, yaa nile hare rang kii vanaspati, hoti he, vah mixofisi varg kii hoti he
 This blue, or green vegetation is unicellular and multicellular fibrous
 in vanaspatiyon main krookocas, cytonema athwa nostock aadi hote hai
 Lichen can be divided into two classes according to the part and appearance of the fungus
 ascolaikenez - isamen kavak bhaag ascomicitis varg kaa ekak hota he
 Bassidioalkenes - The fungal part of this is a unit of the class Basidiomycetes
 ascolikene ko usee falkaay kii banaavat par phir do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: palidhakaay, jisamen falkaay perithisium tathaa vivrutkaay,, jisamen falit bhaag vivrutkaay apothesium hota he
 The internal structure of most of the phenyl lichen is divided into the following four tissues: valkut, jo praaia: udagr kavach sutron se nirmit hoti he, jinke bich bich main, yaa to rikt sthaan nahin hote or yadi hote hai to ve shleshi saamagree se bhare hote hai
 The algae layer is just below the culvert
 isamen shaiwal kii hari koshikaaye uljhe hue kavak sutron main mili rahati hai
 This level is also called Kanistar
 majja shaiwal str ke neeche hoti he or yah shithil tathaa uljhe hue kavak sutron se bani hoti he
 Sub-vulva is made from dense fungal formulas and is the lowest layer
 ad: valkut ke nichle dharaatal se mulabhas nikle hote hai
 They work to connect the thallus to the base and carry mineral salts and water
 parptimay likene main ad: valkut nahin hota or kshupil likene ke thelas main adhikanshat: ek valkut baahar kii ore hota he, jiske neeche shaiwal str tathaa uske neeche ek madhyak aksh hota he
 The algae contained within the lichen are mostly integral to the algae growing outside
 inaki koshikaon main haraa rang nihit hota he, jisaki sahaayta se ye bhojan nirmaan karte hai, kintu jab tak shaiwal likene ke ang hai, tab tak ye prajannaang nahin banaate
 The growth rate in fungal cells is also reduced
 ye kavak swatantra jeevanyaapan ke ayogy ho jate hai
 Lichen are spread around the world
 inamen se adhikansh to taap kii charam simaaon or dirghashoshavadhi main bhi jivit rahane main samarth hai, at: ye aise kshetron main prachurtaa se paae jate hai jahaan sadhrantaya anya vanaspatiyaan nahin ug saktin
 They are found at higher than sea level in tropical regions, Dhruv regions, deserts and water places
 virale hi likene pani ke bheetar milte hai, jinamein hydrothyria venosa naamak shaiwal sabase vicitra he
 In colder climates, lichen become rockers, meaning they spend their lives on rocks, or rocks
 kintu bumadhyarekhik kshetron main ye valkarohi hi rahete hai, arthath vahaan inkaa aadhaar vriksh ke tane tathaa shakhaon kii chhaalen hoti hai
 Some lichen are in situ and some also occur at sea
 inke bade virgon main chote chote samudaay milte hai, jinka vibhaajan chaal kii prakruti, mitti ke swaroop, chattan kii visheshta tathaa taap, ardrata evam anaavaran par nirbhar hota he
 Some lichens grow on fertile soil, where other vegetation is also abundant
 kintu ye bade shaharon ke paas kabhi nahin ug pate, kyonki nagaron ke aas paas ke kaarkaanon kaa dhunaa tathaa anya gas aadi inke liye ghaatak hai
 They depend exclusively on air hygiene
 keval svachh vaayu main hi likene kii prachur vruddhi ho paati he
 Although light is necessary for lichen to grow, some species can grow even in places where there is complete darkness, such as Fisia obscura
 thelas kaa rang prakaash kii kirnon kii tivrata par nirbhar hota he
 The green color of the algae cells is obscured by drying of fungal formulations when the lichen thallus dries
 ardra likene kaa rang haraa hota he, kyonki iske andar sthit tantuon dwaara prakaash kaa pareshan hota he, jisase shaiwal bhaag kaa haraa rang spasht ho jaataa he
 The color of many licenses is particularly attractive
 ye rang vibhinn carbonic amlon ke kaaran hote hai, jo laikenon kaa langalan karne main sahaayta to dete hai parantu saath hi khaane ke liye aruchikar banaate hai
 The presence of these algae cells was an enigma when the texture and structure of lichen was first discovered, as they were very different from the rest of the thallus
 likene ke kuch vidhyaarthiyon ne in hari vastuon ko likene padap kaa abhinn bhaag maanakar yah vichaar prakat kiya he ki inaki utpatti rang rahit kavak tantuon se hi hui he
 Some experts have considered them as part of reproduction and some have accepted them as organs for making food
 sarvapratham shwedenor ne yah pramaan upasthit kiya tha ki yah hari vanaspati shaiwal he jo kavak tantuon dwaara tehrai gai he or paraseete kii gai he
 This theory was tested for the synthesis of lichen by mixing the appropriate algae and fungi
 yadi likene ke donon ang alag alag kar die jaaen to shaiwal ang swatantra jeevanyaapan kar saktaa he, kintu anashrith hone par kavak ang jivit nahin rah saktaa
 When it was fully proved that the body of lichen is made up of two flora, which are algae and fungi respectively, the lichen's attention was drawn to the relation of these two parts for which scholars gave different names and descriptions
 is
 kuch log likene kii tulana ek sankaay se karte hai, jisamen ek shaiwal ek kavak se sambandhit hota he
 Both of these get mutual benefit from this type of relationship and this type of life is called Sahajiyanan
 isamen prayek bhaag kuch aise bhautik kaaryon kaa sampadan karata he, jinase duusare ko laabh ho sake
 The algae organ performs the entire task of preparing food with the presence of its green substances
 is kaary ke liye kavak purnataya asamarth hota he or shaiwal ang dwaara bana bhojya padaarth kavak ko bhi praapt hota he
 On the other hand the fungi of the fungus are responsible for the percolation, mineral salts and water flow and the fungi also protect the algae part from excess dryness, moisture, cold and heat
 kuch vanaspatigyon ke vichaaron ke anusaar yah paraspar laabh kaa sambandh hote hue bhi ek ke liye hanikaarak he
 According to some scholars, this is an example of parasitism, in which the algae part is infested by fungi
 likene kaa koi bhi pruthak hua bhaag uchit vaataavaran main svantraapurvak bad saktaa he
 Some lichen make a special type of organ for reproduction, called soridia
 ye thelas ke chote chote bhaag hote hai, jinamein ek yaa do shaiwal koshikaaye kavak tantuon dwaara aawarit hoti hai
 After breaking down from parental bags, they reach the proper environment by air, rain or animals and make new plants
 inke likene ke donon sanghatak shaiwal tathaa kavak kii santulit vruddhi hoti he
 Some lichens have growth growth like branches, which contain both algae and fungi
 ye udvardh aasaani se pruthak ho jate hai or uchit vaataavaran main nae paudhon ko janm dete hai
 Apart from the promotion of lichen, the constituent fungi and algae also secrete spontaneously
 bahut se laikenon main kavak niyamit rup se ascocarp tathaa dhaani banaate hai, jinka rup perithisium, apothesium, yaa anya prakaar kaa hota he
 These fruits are more colorful and bright
 cladonia christatela kii arohi shakhaon kii laal agr dhaniyon kaa ek samooh hota he
 In the analog state, the spores germinate, giving rise to a formula and if this formula comes close to any algae cells to which it was related to lichen, a new lichen sac is synthesized
 yadi ugte hue kavak jaal ko anukool shaiwal nahin miltaa, to isaki mrityu ho jaati he
 For this reason, it is doubtful whether granules play an important function in the promotion of lichen
 yah sambhav he ki likene janan main khandan tathaa soridem kaa bananaa adhik kaarysadhak ho
 Lichens perform a major function in nature and human life
 ye vanaspatiyon or uchit bhoomi nirmaan ke aavishkarta hai
 The first vegetative to grow on hard and bare rocks is the germinal lichen
 parptimay likene apane dwaara nirmit amlon kii sahaayta se chattaanon ke laavon ko apane avshisht ke saath milakar ek prakaar kii mitti banaate hai, jo haritha ke bijaanu ke liye abhijanan sthaan banataa he or phir pushpiya vanaspatiyon se iskaa upniveshan ho jaataa he
 Many species of lichen are food items for small animals
 inamen se kai junglee pashuon ke moolyavaan bhojya padaarth hai
 Often they are mistakenly called reindeer moss
 manushya bhi, yaa to swaad ke kaaran yaa akaal kii sthiti main koi anya khaadya padaarth na praapt hone par, inkaa upyog karte hai
 Apart from Lapland, Iceland and other sub-polar regions, they are dried and collected in large quantities in India, Japan and other countries to eat human food or cows, buffalo, pigs and horses
 jirophora esculanta china or japan main ek swaadisht khaadya padaarth mana jaataa he
 Ceterea Icelandica is a valuable food lichen, used in Iceland and Scandinavia
 aisa vishwaas he ki bible main varnit "manna" lekanora esculanta naamak likene he, jo asia miner ke registan main rahanevaali jatiyon dwaara khaaya jaataa tha
 Generally, lichen are unsuitable for human food due to their acidic and bitter taste
 likene kii kai jatiyaan pracheen kaal main vyaadhiyon kii chikitsa ke liye prayukt hoti rahi hai, kyonki ve maanav sharir ke angon se milti julati thim
 It was believed that the lichen of Asnia caste was beneficial in hair growth
 isi prakaar kukur likene, peltigera canina, hydrophobia main laabhprad mana jaataa tha
 Other lichen were used for jaundice, diarrhea and fevers
 pracheen kaal main jab sanshlisht rangon kaa nirmaan nahin hua tha, likene kii kuch jatiyaan rang praapt karne kaa pramukh saadhan raheen
 The bright and pleasant colors obtained from them were very valuable
 ek chatakila nila rang orkil, rocksela or lekanora naamak likene se praapt hota he
 Orsin is obtained by purifying the color obtained from these licenses and is used in the coloring of microscopic constructions
 litum rang bhi likene se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Some lichens contain tannin, which is used to cook raw skins of animals
 likene kii kuch jatiyon main suhaavnee gandh hoti he, is kaaran ve sugandh or sabun banane ke kaam main laae jate hai
 Lichens are very useful to us because of their numberless properties
 inaki anupasthiti se prithvi kaa ek bada bhaag nihsandeh banjar evam nirjeev hota tathaa koi banaspati bhi nahin hoti

 Two women had a great contribution in this struggle

 This place was a shelter for revolutionaries
 shrimati natekar ne sabhi prakaar ke khatre uthaate hue sahaayta kii thi
 Today he is not, but his name has become ajar-immortal with other revolutionaries
 duusari mahila jinka athulaneey yogadan is sangram main tha, vah hai shrimati lalita fadake, jo shri sudhir fadake kii dharmapatni hai
 During this struggle, she used to help her colleagues by getting more and more information
 unhone shri sudhir fadake ke saath nirantar kathin pravaas kiya
 Fifty years ago, how big was this armed revolution war, how many days went on, how many sacrifices were made there, etc
 It would be wrong to evaluate this struggle on the test
 ahimsa ke kaal main yah pehali sashastr kranti thi, jiske kaaran goa mukt ho paaya
 There were many youths who participated in this revolution, who prepared to sacrifice themselves, but these people never gained fame for themselves
 adhikansh jantuon main prajnan kii kriya ke liye sansechan anivaary he; parantu kuch aise bhi jantu hai jinamein bina sansechan ke prajnan ho jaataa he, isko aanishek janan yaa alangik janan kehete hai
 Except for some fish, non-reproductive reproduction is not found in any vertebrate nor in some large insects, such as vyadhpatangan and variabhumana
 kuch aise bhi jantu hai jinamein prajnan sarvatha anishek janan dwaara hi hota he, jaise dwijananik viddhpatra, kirotvarg, jalpinshu tathaa druuka main
 Anemia is rarely found in the oculus, but it is found in many species of SUNSHALBHANSH
 ghunon ke kuch anuvanshon main bhi anishek janan praaia: paaya jaataa he
 Several types of non-reproductive genetics can be identified from the point of view of reproduction, sex determination, and cytology
 prajnan kii drushti se anishek janan kaa nimnlikhit vargeekaran ho saktaa he : In this, the non-adult egg sometimes develops
 saamaanya anishek janan nimnlikhit prakaaron kaa hota he: In this, the egg always develops without impregnation: k
 purna anishek janan main sab peedi ke vyaktiyon main anishek janan paaya jaataa he
 B
 In cyclic disintegration generation one generation generation comes after one or more non-bipolar genera
 isamen anda yaa to sansikt hokar viksit hota he yaa anishek janan dwaara
 From the idea of gender determination, there are three types of non-reproductive reproduction: k
 punjanan main asansikt andey anishek janan dwaara viksit hokar nar jantu banate hai
 Consecutive eggs become female animals
 kha
 strijnan main asansikt andey viksit hokar maadaa jantu banate hai
 C
 In males, unprincipled eggs develop and some males and some females develop
 koshikatatv kii drushti se anishek janan kai prakaar kaa hota he: In quasi-noncritical reproduction, the organisms produced by non-intracellular reproduction develop from eggs in which the nucleus formulas fall and the amount of nucleus formulations is reduced to half
 yah do vidhi se hota he: The number of nucleotides in animals produced by non-reproductive reproduction in tanu anaerobic reproduction is double or multiplicative
 yah do vidhiyon se hota he: In autoregulatory disseminated generation, there is regular paired and depletion of nucleus formulas and the number of nucleus formulas is reduced to half of the eggs
 parantu cendrak sutron kii maatra, do ardhakendrakon ke sammelan se pun: sthapit cendrak ke nirmaan athwa antarbhaajan dwaara pun: bad jaati he
 Amathuni disintegration is neither a reduction in the amount of nucleus formulas, nor is there a paired bonding and depletion of the nucleus formulas in a half-anointed reproductive egg
 aise andon kaa yadi sansechan hota he to ve viksit hokar maadaa ban jate hai or yadi sansechan nahin hota to ve nar banate hai
 For this reason, eggs of the same female can develop and become male and also female
 ardhak anishek janan kaa fal is kaaran sadaa hi vaikalpik evam punjanan hota he

 Three types of statistics are mainly used in physics
 chirasmat sankhyikee, bose-oinstin or fermi- dirack sankhyikee
 The second and the third type are also called as quantum statistics, because in these we study the properties of complex communities by quantum theory
 kwantum sankhyikee ke avishkaar ke purv chirsammat sankhyikee se hi yah kaary liya jaataa tha or isamen paryaapt safalataa bhi milti thi
 But in the long run, there were some inventions related to special heat at low temperature, radiation of black object, which could not explain the classical physics properly
 is prakaar kwantum siddhant kaa janm hua
 The invention of quantum statistics, India's renowned scientist S
 N
 Bose did this in 1924 when he first formulated Planck's radiation law in a statistical manner
 gasiy samudaay ke liye isi niyam kaa prasar karte hue oinstin ne bose-oinstin sankhyikee naamak siddhant kaa moulik rup se pratipaadan kiya
 In 1924, Fermi and Dirac independently founded the foundation of fermi-dirac statistics, based on Pauli's exclusion principle
 samaan kanon ke kisi samudaay main siddhantat: kan kan main antar kar paanaa asambhav he, isliye samudaay kaa tarangafalan kinhin do kanon ke nirdeshaanko main samamit athwa asamamit hona chahie
 This has many effects, such as exchange action, which is responsible for iron magnetization and anti-methylation in certain metals
 vibhinn kanon ko do shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he jisase ek prakaar ke samaan kanon kaa samudaay bose-oinstin-sankhyikee ke anusaar hoga or duusare prakaar ke samaan kanon kaa vyavhaar fermi-dirack-sankhyikee par aadhaarit hoga
 All the translucent nuclei that have a codename pair, the bose-einstein-statistic include K-mesan), etc
, and those that have a codified number, all behave according to the fermi-dirac-statistic
 seemaant dasha main fermi-dirack, bose-oinstin tathaa maxwell sankhyikee kaa vyavhaar ek samaan hota he
 How different are the properties of a community of inert similar particles from the properties of an ideal gas, iskaa anumaan hamen p=nh3 / g se miltaa he
 In this formula, m = particle code, n = number of particles in a cubic even, h = Planck constant, k = Boltzmann constant, t = absolute temperature of the community and g we call the weight factor whose value is two more electrons Is three for yadi p kaa maan ek se kam he to gas kaa vyavhaar adarsh gas ke samaan hota he
 The maximum value of p for Bose gas is 2
612 and such a gas is said to be completely inductive
 yah bose -istin saghanan kriya se sabandhit he, jo drav He4 main 2
19 param taap par hota he
 Some properties of this fluid at a lower temperature than this ultimate temperature are very amazing, such as hyperthermia
 He3, jo fermi-dirack-sankhyikee kaa paripaalan karata he, He4 kii tarah shunya param taap tak drav hi rahata he or 0
08 param taap tak atitaral nahin banataa
 These two liquids are called quantum liquids
 fermi-dirack sakhyikee main jab p ek se bahut adhik bada hota he, tab gas purnataya apikrusht kehalaati he
 The conduction electrons in metals form inert gas
 dhaatuon ke vaidyut or ushmiya gun isi vidhi se bhalee bhanti samajhaae ja sakate he
 It is clear from the above formula that a gas behaves at ordinary temperature according to the Maxwell statistic, but as its temperature decreases and its pressure increases, the value of p increases and the gas becomes quantum
 ek vishesh shrenee ke taron kaa ghanatv, jinhen hwite dwarf taare kehete hai, bahut hi adhik hota he 
 The behavior of the matter of such stars is completely according to the fermi-dirac-statistic
 ab tak bose tathaa fermi sankhyikee kaa keval un gaison ke gunon ke adhyayan ke liye prayog kiya gaya jinke kanon main koi aakarshak shakti nahin he or jinke kan kaa maan shunya he
 But with the help of quantum statistics from the last ten to fifteen years, gases whose particles have some attraction power and whose particles are like hard shells are being studied
 aaj hamen kwantum sankhyikee dwaara ninn taap par dhaatuon ke gunon ke vishay main pehle se kahin adhik gyaan he; udhaahrant;, atichaalakata ke vishay main
 Hopefully in the next few years we will be able to make even more progress on this path
 rageshwari hindi filmon kii ek abhinetri hai
 'evidence' has two meanings: kai vishay aise hote hai, jinke liye pramaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Other relevant topics are substantiated by evidence
 sakshi ke kathan, sweekaarokti evam upyukt kaagajon kii peshi sakshya ke antargat hai
 The first obligation to give evidence lies with the party who is to authenticate the case in the primary
 prayek paksh par pramanbhaar kaa apana-apana daayitv rahata he
 If the party who is responsible for giving evidence does not produce the appropriate evidence, then the court will give its decision against it
 dandabhiyog ke maamalon main pramanbhaar maamla chalaanevaale par rahata he
 There is no exception to this rule
 kanoon kii prakalpana he ki abhiyukt nirdosh he, jab tak uske viruddh laayaa hua abhiyog bilkul nihsandeh pramanit na kar diya jaay
 Therefore, in such cases, the charge rests on the person conducting the case and he / she has to prove each step of the prosecution, even if he has to give evidence on the negative content itself
 abhiyukt ko apane ko nirdosh pramanit nahin karnaa padataa
 In civil cases, the responsibility for the charge is on the party who asserts his or her self in the contentious matter
 yah niyam is siddhant par aadhaarit he ki jo paksh kisi vishay ke astitv kaa samarthan kare, use hi uskaa pramaan dena chahie, na ki pratipakshi ko jo vivaadaaspad vishay ke astitv ko sweekaar nahin karata
 Therefore, in civil cases, the charge remains on the plaintiff
 yadi vah us daayitv ko nibhaataa he tathaa maamle ko praathmik rup main pramanit karata he, jisase use traan mil sake to aisi sthiti main uske daawey ke viruddh pramaan dene kaa daayitv prativaadee par chalaa jaataa he
 During the testimony, when the responsibility of the charge will go from the plaintiff to the defendant and from the defendant to the plaintiff, it is difficult to say
 paraspar die gaye sakshya ke anusaar yah badalata rahata he
 But ultimately the charge remains on the party who, by not giving evidence in response to the evidence of the opponent, will be defeated in the case
 maamle se sweekrut sakshya ke aadhaar par hi nyaayalay vivaadaaspad daawey kii pariksha karata he evam jis paksh ko sakshya kii bahulata praapt hoti he, usee ke paksh main apana nirnay detaa he
 Often people buy land or other property in the name of others
 inhen 'benami' kehete hai
 The party which wants to declare 'benami' invalid from the court, is charged with the fact that the buyer is actually someone else and the person in whose name the property has been purchased is the buyer of the name only
 is prasang main kharid kii rakam kahan se ai, yah baat vishesh rup se vichaarneey hoti he
 In a civil case, if a party says that his case is based on a specified law, and that the general law of the country does not apply in his case, then he has to unquestionably certify the said law or the practice
 manahani ke maamalon main pramanbhaar vaadi par rahata he
 He has to first give evidence that he is not guilty for the stigma brought against him
 uske sakshya dene ke baad hi prativaadee is baat kaa pramaan de saktaa he ki usne shuddh bhaavana evam janhit kii drushti se hi vah baat kahi thi yaa likhi thi, jiske viruddh vaadi ne maamla kiya he
 If it is claimed on behalf of the government that a person has died without leaving an heir, so his property belongs to the government according to the law of 'eschat', then the government will be in charge that the last officer of the property died without leaving the heir
 
 yadi koi jaali check par kisi ko rupye de detaa he to bank par is baat kaa pramanbhaar hoga ki cheke babat uski ore se koi asaavadhaanee nahin hui
 In the claim of malicious case, the plaintiff has to prove that the defendant had prosecuted the plaintiff with malice and lack of reasonable cause
 yadi kisi stri kaa pati yah kahe ki uski stri duusare purush ke saath dushtacharan main thi to use hi stri ke dushtacharan ko pramanit karnaa hoga
 There is no such notion of law in Hindu legislation that the property of the family members is joint by having a joint family
 kintu yadi sweekaar kar liya jaay yaa pramanit ho jaay ki koi hindu parivaar sanyukt he tathaa sanyukt parivaar kii sampatti iske adheen he to is kram main kanoon kii prakalpana he ki sanyukt parivaar ke bhinn bhinn sadasyon ke adheen sadsy yadi vyaktigat rup main ukt sampatti kaa daawa karen to unhen hi pramaan dena padegaa ki sampatti unki apni he, sanyukt parivaar kii nahin
 If the execution of a document is certified, but it should be said that the document maker was deranged at the time the document was being written, then the document of the brain's malaise lies with the document maker
 yadi vah vyakti dastavej ke nishpaadan ke pehle veikshipt rahaa ho, par yah kaha jaay ki dastavej banane ke samay vah maansik santulan main tha, to iskaa pramanbhaar bhi usee par rahegaa
 If the execution of a document is deemed to be certified, but the subject matter mentioned in it is said to be untrue and fake that it was not intended to work accordingly, then the said accuser will bear the charge of this statement
 yadi registery kiye athwa na kiye hue kisi dastavej ko maamle main sweekaar kar liya jaay to is baat kaa pramanbhaar ki isamen pratifal nahin tha, dastavej banaanevaale par he
 The above general law applicable in the context of charge in civil cases has two options: dandabhiyog kii apil main pramanbhaar saadhaarant: maamla chalaanevaale par rahata he
 The court has to see whether the punishment awarded to the accused is correct
 yadi kisi aise nirnay ke viruddh apil ho, jahaan abhiyukt ko mukt kar diya gaya he, to vahaan maamla chalaanevaale par pramanbhaar kaa daayitv or bhi gurutar he
 The charge in the civil appeal lies with the appellant
 use hi pramanit karnaa padataa he ki apil ke antargat diya hua nirnay galat he

 kabhi-kabhi shabd parampara yaa haddees kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The Syrah literature includes various asymmetrical materials, mainly consisting of stories of military campaigns carried out by Muhammad and his companions
 ye kahaniyaan aitihaasik khaaton ke rup main lakshith hai or puja ke liye upyog kii jaati hai
 Sira also contains a number of written documents, such as political treaties, military lists, functions of officers, letters to foreign rulers, and so forth
 yah pheravell tirthayatra main unke bhaashan kii tarah mohammad dwaara kiye gaye kuch bhaashanon or upadeshon ko bhi record karata he
 Some Syrah accounts include verses of poetry that commemorate certain events and battles
 jabaki inamen se kuch ko kam gunvattta or pramanikta kii kami mana jaataa he, unamem se sabase gambhir hasan ebn thabeet dwaara hai
 In later periods, certain types of stories included in Sira developed into their own distinct genres
 ek style bhavishyavaaniyon ke chamatkaaron kii kahaniyon se chintit he, jise alam al-nubuva kaha jaataa he 
 Another genre, called the flayal wa mathalib - stories that show the merits and demerits of personal companions, enemies, and other notable contemporaries of Muhammad
 sira ke kuch kaaryon ne mohammad kii kahani ko ek katha ke hisse ke rup main bhi rakhaa jisamen purv bhavishyadvaktaaon, farsi raajaaon, purv islamic arab janajatiyon or rashidun kii kahaniyaan shaamil thim
 Parts of Syrah were inspired, or elaborated, by events described in the Quran
 kuch hisson main ullikhit ghatnaon ke liye prishthbhumi jaankaree pradaan karne ke liye in bhaagon ko aksar tafaseer or esbab al-nuzul ke lekhakon dwaara upyog kiya jaataa tha
 The main difference between a hadith and a historical report is that a hadith is not concerned with such an event, and does not usually specify time or place
 iske bajaay haddees kaa uddeshy ek dharmik siddhant ko islamic kanoon ke aadhikarik strot ke rup main record karnaa he
 Conversely, while a grave may have some legal or religious implications, its main purpose is to convey information about a certain event
 sanrachana ke sandarbh main, haddees or khabar bahut samaan hai
 Both include Isanad
 is prakaar 8 veen or 9veen shatabdi se shuru hone se, kai vidwaanon ne donon prakaar ke granthon ke samaan prayaason ko samarpit kiya he
 Also some historians consider Sira and Maghaji literature as a subset of Hadith
 islam kii shuruaati shatabdiyon ke dauraan, siyaara sahitya ko haddees kii tulana main kam gambhirtha se liya gaya tha
 In the Umayyad period, storytellers used to tell stories of Muhammad and earlier prophets in private gatherings and mosques, as they received permission from the authorities
 inamen se kai kahanikar ab agyaat hai
 After the Umayyad period, his reputation deteriorated as he exaggerated and was inclined to imagine and rely on Israelite
 is prakaar unhen masjidon main prachaar karne se pratibandhit kar diya gaya tha
 In later periods, however, Syrah's works became more prominent
 haal hi main, pashchimi aitihaasik aalochana or sira se sambandhit bahes ne kuch muslimon se rakshaatmak ravaiya praapt kiya he jinhone apni saamagree kaa bachaav karne vaale kshamapraarthi sahitya likhaa tha
 For centuries, Muslim scholars have recognized the problem of authenticity of hadith
 is prakaar unhone isnadon kaa moolyankan karne ke parishkrut tareekon viksit kiye hai
 This was done to classify each hadith into "sound" for authentic reports, as opposed to "weak" for the weak ones, among other categories
 chunki kai sira reporton main isnaad kii jaankaree bhi shaamil he or kuch sira compilers swayan jurists or haddees transmeter kaa abhyaas kar rahe the, isliye sira reporton ke liye haddees aalochana ke samaan tareekon ko lagu karnaa sambhav tha
 However, some Sira reports were written using an unfamiliar form of isnad, or what modern historians call the "collective isnad" or "joint report"
 samuhik isnaad kaa upyog yah tha ki ek vyakti ko duusare vyakti ke adhikaar par kisi vyakti ke shabdon ko alag kiye bina ek report sambandhit ho sakati he
 This lack of precision led some Hadith scholars to take any report that used a collective isnad for lack of authenticity
 vim reven ke mutabik, aksar yah dhyaan diya jaataa he ki mohammad kii ek susangat chhavi kaa nirmaan sira ke sahitya se nahin kiya ja saktaa he, jisaki pramanikta or tathyaatmak mulya par kai alag-alag aadhaaron par sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 He lists the following arguments against the authenticity of the tip, following the arguments given here: phir bhi, madina ke samvidhan kii tarah sira kii anya saamagree ko aam taur par pramanik mana jaataa he
 The following is a list of some of the early Hadith collectors who specialized in collecting and compiling the Sira and Maghaji reports: gandhi smriti bharat ke nai dilli sthit ek sangrahalay he jo mahatma gandhi ko samarpit he
 It is located on Tis Jan Marg
 purv main ise birla bhawan kaha jaataa tha
