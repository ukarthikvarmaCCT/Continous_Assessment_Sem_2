 isamen shringaar or shant rason kii nahin, vir ras kii pradhanta he
 This metaphor has only one digit
 sanskrit roopak ke mukhya rup se teen tatva hote hai- kathavstu, netaa or ras

 Mahakavi Bhasa has taken the story of the envoy from the industry festival of Mahabharata
 mahabharat kii mul katha is prakaar he- After losing at Dutikrida, the Pandavas returned after fulfilling the condition of spending twelve years in exile and one year in exile
 jab unhone kauravon se apane hisse kaa rajya maanga, to duryodhana ne asweekaar kar diya
 Efforts of agreement between the Kauravas and the Pandavas began
 jab yah kaary saralata se sampann hota na dikhaa, tab yudhisthir ne vinaashkari shuddh ke sthaan par kauravon ke saath sandhi karwaane ke uddeshy se shrikrishna se unka doot banane kaa nivedan kiya
 Dhritarashtra made full arrangements to welcome him as his messenger when he reached Hastinapur
 shrikrishna pehle kunti ke paas gayi, phir duryadhan aadi ke paas
 He stayed at Vidur's house, where he heard that the Kauravas were fully prepared for war and they were not ready to accept anything of Shri Krishna; Therefore, the Krishna karma will go in vain
 phir bhi ve duusare din vidura ke saath rajsabha main upasthit hue
 When all the members sat in place, they told Dhritarashtra that they had come to negotiate peace with the Kauravas on behalf of the Pandavas
 shrikrishna ne duryodhana ke aage pandavon ko daybhag dene kaa prastaav rakhaa
 The Kaurava chiefs Bhishma, Drona, Vidur and Dhritarashtra also asked Duryodhana to give away the Pandavas, but Durvinit Duryodhana was not willing to give the Pandavas land equal to the point of needle
 sandhi kaa prastaav thukraa kar unase nirnay ko yuddh par hi chhod dene kii baat kii
 He became angry and ignored the talk of Gandhari and left the Raj Sabha with his brothers
 kisi prakaar vidura kii prarthana par vah punah rajsabha main aayaa
 Again he asked Shakuni, Karna, Dushasasana etc
 to make Sri Krishna a prisoner
 kisi prakaar dhritaraashta ne use is nindaneey karm se roka
 Then Shri Krishna showed his Virat form, which was seen by the blind Dhritarashtra, Drona, Bhishma, Vidura and Sanjay by the grace of Shri Krishna
 dhritaraashta ne shrikrishna ke charnon main sir rakhkar kshamaa maangi
 Returning to the Pandavas, Shri Krishna described the failure of his compromise
 ‘dootvaakya’ main kavi ne mahabharat ke isi kathansh ko kuch bhinn rup main prastut kiya he- nandipath ke pashchaat pravisht hua sutaradhar jaise hi kuch batalaane ja rahaa tha ki tabhi use nepathy se kuch shabd sunai padataa he
 It is known from him that there has been opposition between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, and for this, by order of Duryodhana, his servant is arranging the Mantrasala
 duryodhana ek vir raja ke rup main rangamanch par upasthit hota he
 He sits in the synagogue with respect to all invited kings and councilors
 sabhi sabhaasadon ke bich shakuni ke suzav par bhishma senapati chune jate hai
 At the same time Kanchukali Badarayan informs about the arrival of Purushottam Narayan as the messenger from the Pandavas' camp
 shrikrishna ko narayan kehane par duryodhana krodhit ho uthta he or kanchukeey se kahata he ki kaho ki keshav naamak doot aayaa he
 Later he asks the kings present how we should behave with Krishna
 unke aadarsuchak uttar ko sunakar vah punah uttejit ho uthta he or kahata he ki krishna ko bandi bana lenaa hi use ruchikar he
 He commands that no one will rise from his posture with respect to Keshav
 yadi kisi ne aisa kiya to use rajya kii ore se kathin dand diya jaayegaa
 To prevent himself from getting up, he asks Badarayan to draw a curtain of Draupadi's hair which he can see while sitting
 chitrapat ko dekhte hue vah draupadi, yudhisthir, bhim, arjuna, nakul-sahadev, shakuni, acharya aadi kii bhav-bhangimaaon kaa chithran karata he
 At the behest of Duryodhana, the Kanchukali messenger goes to take Krishna
 duryadhan karn se krishna ke nari jaise mridu vachan sunne ko taiyaar hone ko kahata he
 All the kings and Kshatriyas stand in panic as Shri Krishna enters the assembly
 duryodhana bhi apane asana se gir jaataa he
 Vasudeva Krishna requests all the kings to take postures with respect
 draupadi ke kesh or vastra khinchne ke chitra ko duryodhana ke paas dekhakar ve man hi man uski bhartsana karte hai ki apane hi kul ke bandhuon ke apmaan karne ko morrkhtaa ke kaaran duryadhan apana parakram samajhataa he
 Under the formal skilfulness, Vasudev tells the message of the Pandavas that 'what is our duty, we should get
 ’ duryodhana kahata he ki ‘pandu ko munishaap mila tha atah pandav to devputra hai phir hamaare bandhu kaise hue? unka pita ke dhan main kya adhikaar?’ vasudev duryodhana se poochhate hai ki dhritaraashta bhi apane pita vichitraveery ke dhan ke uttaradhikari kaise ho sakate hai? duryodhana vasudev ko unke bal-krityon par bhi ulaahna dene lagata he
 Duryodhana and Bokhla are swayed by the rational candor of Sri Krishna
 vah kahata he ki rajya bhiksha main praapt karne kii vastu nahin
 He will not give even the state's tarmac to the Pandavas
 vasudev usko chetavanee dete hue kehete hai ki tumhaare kaaran sampoorn kuruvansh kaa sheeghra hi vinaash ho jayega
 They begin to leave
 duryodhana unako bandi banane kii ajna detaa he
 Vasudeva appears in Vishwaroop
 duryoghan unki maaya se or adhik chakra jaataa he or baahar nikal jaataa he
 Vasudev gets angry and calls Sudarshan Chakra, he appears in human form
 sudarshan ke samajhane par vasudev prakrutistha hote hai
 Anant Vasudeva's divinity horn Dhanush, Kaumodaki Gada, Panchajanya Shankh and Nandak Asi enter one after the other and return to Sudarshan's explanation
 phir vishnuvaahan garud kaa pravesh hota he
 Seeing the peace of God, all return to their respective dhams
 baad main shrikrishna bhi pandavon ke shivi main lautne lagate hai ki tabhi vruddh dhritaraashta kaa pravesh hota he
 Dhritarashtra falls at the feet of Vasudev and apologizes for the crime of sons
 bharatvakya ke saath dootvaakya roopak samaapt hota he
 When we compare the story of Dutvakya with the original story of Mahabharata, we see some fundamental changes made by Mahakavi Bhasa
 mahabharat main dhritaraashta raja hai, ve krishna ke doot rup main aane par rajsinghaasana par baithte hai jabaki dootvaakya main duryodhana ko raja ke rup main avatarit kiya gaya he
 The picture poet related to Draupadi's hairstyle and clothing in the envoy is the origin of the poet
 mahabharat main shrikrishna ko bandi banane kaa koi vishesh praytn nahin kiya jaataa he jabaki dootvaakya main unako baandhne kaa praytn dikhaaya gaya he
 The embodiment of divine armaments and vehicle Garuda in human form in the envoy is the poet's own imagination
 kavi ne shrikrishna or duryodhana ke lambe vaartalap ko atyant vyangypurna or rochak bana diya he
 With all these innovations, the story and dialogues of the envoy have become beautiful and effective
 doot ke rup main upasthit shrikrishna ke vaakya arthath sandhi -prastaav par aadhaarit hone ke kaaran is roopak kaa naam ‘dootvaakya’ sarvatha sarthak he

 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 Therefore, leave forgiveness of anger and vengeance and be forgiving! This will be the obligatory behavior

 pargana katehar main kaith ke paas kii chachariyon se aisa lagata he ki inhen conkarile karaaron ke kaaran nadi ek samay dakshin kii ore gum jaati thi
 The knowledge of the flow of this ancient stream of Ganga is from Banganga, which fills in the rain
 taanda se shuru hokar banganga dakshin kii ore chha: mile tak mahuwari kii ore jaati he, phir purv kii ore rasulpur tak, ant main uttar main ramgarh ko paar karti hui vah hasanpur tak jaati he
 At the time when this approach of the Ganges had its edge, Gomti flowed in the current stream of the Ganges which was found near the Saidpur in the Ganges
 janashruti yah he ki shantanu ne banganga ko kashiraj kii kanya ke swayamvar ke avasar par prithvi phodkar nikaala
 The capital of Kashiraj was Ramgarh at that time
 agar kisi samay rajprasad ramgarh main tha to vah ganga par rahaa hoga or is tarah is lok katha ke aadhaar par bhi yah kaha ja saktaa he ki ek samay ganga ramgarh se hokar bahati thi
 There is also a lot of evidence in ancient literature about this ancient stream of Ganga
 brahman or buddha sahitya main to ganga kii is dhara kii koi charchaa nahin he par jain sahitya main iskaa thodaa bahut ullekh he
 The Jainas called Nayadhamma, an ancient organ, mentions that to the north-east of Varanasi was the Mayaganga Teerthadah, meaning the dead Ganges
 uttaradhyayan churni ke anusaar mayganga ke nichle bahaav ke rukh main ek hrid tha jisamen kaaphi pani ikattha ho jaataa tha jo kabhi nikalataa nahin tha
 Jinprabhasuri has described the birthplace of Mathangi Rishi Force as the place of death in various pilgrimages
 katha main yah kaha gaya he ki rishi bal ek samay tinduk naamak upavan main tehre the
 There he pleased the filthy tanduk Yaksha with his qualities
 kosal raaj kii kanya ne ek samay rishi ko dekhakar un par thook diya
 On this, Yaksha climbed on his head and Raj Kanya had to marry Rishi
 rishi ne baad main use tyaag diya or usne rudradev se vivaah kar liya
 The Brahmins were once insulting the sage who went on begging but Bhadra recognized him and condemned the Brahmins
 rishi ne phir brahmanon ko bhi kshamaa kar diya
 Many things are known from the above story related to the dead Ganga, the first being that at least in the Gupta era, when the Nayadhamma was written, the dead Ganga was similar to today
 duusari yah ki yah mritganga varanasi ke uttar-purv main thi jo bhugolic drushtikon se bilkul thik he
 Thirdly, 1300 years ago, it used to be filled with water and it would become a flame
 ab to mritganga main pani keval barsaat main aata he
 It was probably 1000 years ago that the Banganga was deeper and later became unable to stop the water due to the shallow filling of the soil
 ramgarh main banganga ke tat par vairant ke pracheen khandhiron kii sthiti he, jo mahatvapurn he
 According to folk tales, ancient Varanasi was once inhabited here
 sabase pehle bairant ke khandhiron kii jaanch padtaal e
si
el
 karlil ne kii
 Vairant's position is about 16 miles south-east of Saidpur in the south of the Ganges and about 16 miles north-east of Varanasi and about 12 miles south-west of Ghazipur
 vairant ke khandhar banganga ke vartulakaar dakshin-purvi kinare par hai
 The etymology of Bairand's name cannot be accurately said
 matsyon kii rajdhani bairant jo jaipur, rajasthan main he, isse bhinn he, phir bhi matsyon ke is pradesh main hone kaa ullekh ek jagah mahabharat main aayaa he
 It seems that Matsya may not have been stable in one place and may have been moving back and forth and may be related to this name
 par loukik anushruti main satya kaa ansh he or ise ek afvaah maanakar taala nahin ja saktaa he
 The ruins of the Bairant ruins the ancient fortress on the eastern corner of Banganga
 pracheen nagar ke avshesh kile se lekar dakshin main bahut dur tak jameen par he, iske baad ve ghumkar dakshin-pashchim kii ore nadi ke kinare par sthit he
 The old fort is made of clay but many bricks are also found in it
 uttar-dakshin main isaki lambaai lagbhag 410 meter or purab main lagbhag 275 meter he
 Beside it there are the remains of type 20 to 30 meters wide
 kahin-kahin yah vapra he par adhakar naaliyon se cat gaya he
 The Attalkas on three sides of the fort namely north-east, north-west and south-east have survived
 kile ke chaaron phatakon kaa vishesh rup se uttar-dakshin ke phatakon kaa abhi bhi pataa lagata he
 Inside the fort, about one third of the south is low, then one third of the land is climbing north and the northern fourth part of the fort is even more
 uttar-purv attalak ke paas kisi badi imaarat ke bhagnavshesh hai
 The trench marks outside the fort still appear north-south
 kile se kareeb 120 meter kii duuri par vairant naamak gaanv he
 There is another mound 50 meters to the north-east of this village
 gaanv se uttar kii ore kareeb 620 meter par bhagatin kaa talab he, jiske uttar main kareeb 100 meter par ek doosraa tila he
 About 200 meters west of the pond is a temple named Ramsala, where the Aghori Mahant and his disciples live
 is mandir se kareeb 1 kimi uttar main ramgarh kaa gaanv he
 There is some land covered with sand and bricks at 210 meters northeast of Bairant village
 kile ke dakshin main kareeb 140 meter par praakaar ke bhagnavshesh hai, jo purv se pashchim tak kareeb 425 meter tak dikhaai padate hai
 There is a chauras mound near it, which has a drain in the south
 is naale se kareeb 900 meter par rasulpur kaa gaanv or ek tila he
 In this way, it is seen that on the eastern side of Banganga, an ancient city was located from the old fort to Rasulpur because in the rainy period, there is a lot of bricks and bricks coming out of it
 itnaa hi nahin pracheen shahar ke bhagnavshesh rasulpur se dakshin-pashchim kareeb 700-800 meter or aage tak chale gaye hai
 Banganga is the old ghat on the southern corner of this extension of the city
 jahaan shahar ke avshesh khatm hote hai vahaan mitti kaa ek burj he
 According to Carlile, the entire length of the city, except the ancient fort, is about 3 or 3-5 km
 purab se pashchim tak shahar kii chaudaai kaa isliye thik pataa nahin lagata kyonki kheton ke liye jameen samtal kar di gayi he
 But if we look carefully, the north and width of the city are about 600 meters and south 400 meters to 300 meters and typical southern side is 240 meters
 pracheen nagar ke theth purv main ek pracheen chhichhli nadi kaa tal thi jisase nagar ghira tha
 It is dry now but it fills a little water during the rainy season
 karlile ne bairant se bahut-se aahat or dhalue sikke paae
 In the Brahmi script of the second century BCE, he found coins of Jyeshtadatta and Vijayamitra and also coins of Kanishka
 ram krishnadas evam dow moti chand ne bhi bairant se bahut aahat sikke ikatthe kiye
 One coin has the article "gomi" in Sungkal Brahmi
 karlile ko akik ityadi kii bahut si maniyan bhi yahan se mili he
 Bharatkala Bhavan Kashi Hindu University also has a good collection of such beads
 yahan hathi daant kii chudiyon ke bhi tukade kaaphi sankhya main milte hai
 Carlile also found stone age chips and cores from the drains and fields around Bairante, all these things prove that Bairand's settlement is ancient
 kaali mitti ke opedaar bartanon ke tukdon ke milane se to yah nishchit ho jaataa he ki maury yug main yahan basti thi
 Above we described the ancient city of Vairant in such a way that the status of this city sheds light on the ancient history of Varanasi
 is jagah kaashi kii pracheen sthiti ke sambandh kii kuch baton kaa jaananaa aavashyak he
 There is a legend in Mahabharata that Kashiraj Hariya was beaten to death by Vitishvyo in the Ganges and Yamuna plains
 harya ke putr sudev ko bhi ladaai main maat khaani padi
 Later his son Divodas settled in the second Varanasi on the north bank of the Ganges and the south bank of Gomti
 ab prashn uthta he ki divodas kaa basaaya yah doosraa varanasi kahaan par tha? ganga kii aadhunik dhara ko dekhte hue yah nagar ganga-gomti ke sangam kathi ke paas hona chahie par kathi ke aas-paas kisi pracheen nagar kaa bhagnavshesh nahin he
 Chandravati is not even before the Gahadwal era and a big city does not even get the name mark here
 aaj tak yah bhi nahin sunne main aayaa ki chandravati se koi pracheen sikke bhi mili hai
 On searching around, there is no place other than Bairand where there has been a city in ancient times
 ganga-gomti kii vartmaan dhara is mat ke viruddh padati he, par ganga kii pracheen dhara kii agar kalpana kii jaae to bairant par hi divodas kii banaayi duusari varanasi sambhav jaan padati he
 Banganga joins the current flow of the Ganges at Hasanpur via Raswurpur to the east
 jis samay ganga kaa mul pravaah banganga kaanthe se tha, is samay gomti ganga kii vartmaan dhara main bahati hui saidpur ke paas ganga se aa milti thi
 In this way Bairant or ancient Varanasi used to fall south of Gomti as stated in Mahabharata
 ab prashn yah he ki yah nayi varanasi kab tak basii rahi? aisa jaan padataa he ki jab tak ganga ne apana pravaah nahin badla tha tab tak nagar bairant main hi bana rahaa
 But when the Ganges left this place, the city also gradually became deserted and in the end remained only mound
 lekin yah sab hua kab? aisa pataa lagata he ki mauryayug tak to vairant kaa shahar basaa tha or shaayad ganga ne teesri shatabdi isa purv ke baad hi apana rasta badla hoga
 At least as we know from the followers, in the Gupta era, the dead Ganga means Banganga had come into history, so the Ganga must have changed its path many centuries ago
 yah prashn aitihaasik drushti se bade mahatv kaa he par is prashn par or adhik prakaash tabhi pad saktaa he jab vairant kii aadhunik bhang se khudaai ho
 Barring two minor drains like Subha and Assi, the main tributaries of the Ganga in this district are Barna and Gomti
 varanasi ke itihaas ke liye to barna kaa kaaphi mahatv he kyonki jaisaa ham pehle siddh kar chuke hai is nadi ke naam par hi varanasi nagar kaa naam padaa
 In the Atharvaveda, perhaps Barna is referred to as Baranavati
 us yug main logon kaa vishwaas tha ki is nadi ke pani main sarp-vish dur karne kaa alokik gun he
 The name of this river was "varanasi" in the ancient mythological era
 barna elahabaad or mirzapur jilon kii seemaa par phulpur ke taal se nikaalkar varanasi jile kii seemaa main pashchimi ore se ghusati he or yahan uskaa sangam visuhi nadi se sarwan gaanv main hota he
 The name Visuhi may be related to poison
 sambhavat: barna nadi ke jal main vish harne kii shakti ke pracheen vishwaas kaa sanket hamen uski ek sahaayak nadi ke naam se miltaa he
 Bisuhi and beyond it forms the border of Jaunpur and Varanasi to some extent
 bal khaati hui barna nadi purab kii ore jaati he or dakshin or kasavaar ore dehaat amaanat kii ore uttar main pandraha athganva or shivpur kii simaaen nirdhaarit karti he
 From the north of the Banaras Cantonment, the river turns towards the southeast and at the Sarai Mohana, it merges with the Ganges
 varanasi ke upar is par do tirth he, rameshwar ore kalkabada
 The two banks of the river are generally from the beginning to the end and are cut by countless ravines
 is nadi kaa bhi puraanon main bahut ullekh he
 In the mythological era it was believed that the border of Varanasi region was from Gomti to Barna
 is jile main pahunchne ke pehle gomti kaa paat sai ke milane se bad jaati he
 The river flows through Sultanipur in the north of the district and forms the northern outskirts of the district for 22 miles from there till the confluence of the Ganges at Kathy
 nadi kaa bahaav tedha-medhaa he or iske kinare kahin-kahin dhalue hai
 Nand is the only tributary of Gomti
 yah nadi jonpur kii seemaa par kol aslaa main phulpur ke uttar-purv se nikalati he or dhaurhara main gomti se ja milti he
 a small river named Hathi is found near Hariharpur in Nanda
 madhyakaal main hinduon kaa yah vishwaas tha ki karamnasa ke pani ke sparsh se punya nasht ho jaataa he
 Karamnasa and its tributaries are in Chandauli district
 nadi cabhur pahadiyon se nikalakar mirzapur jile se hoti hui, pehle-pahal banaras jile main majhavaar pargane se fatahpur gaanv se gumti he
 After running about 10 miles in the south-eastern part of Majhwar, Karamnasa separates the Pargana Narvam from the district Shahabad, forming the border of Ghazipur
 jile ko kakarait main chhodti hui fatehpur se 34 mile par chaunsaa main vah ganga se mil jaati he
 There is a bridge on this river in Naubatpur and from here the railway line goes to Grand Trunk Road and Gaya
 karamnasa kii mukhya sahaayak nadi gadi he jo mirzapur kii pahadiyon se nikalakar pargana dhoos ke dakshin main shivnathpur ke paas se is jile main ghusati he or kuch dur tak majhavaar or dhoos kii seemaa banaati hui baad main majhavaar hoti hui purab kii ore karamnasa main mil jaati he
 In Majhwar, Chandraprabha emerges from the mountainous region of Mirzapur near Gurari and joins Karamnasa in the north by flowing into Mirzapur, a little distance touching the district of Baburi
 banaras jile kii nadiyon ke ukt varnan se yah gyaat hota he ki banaras main to prasraavak nadiyaan he lekin chandauli main nahin he jisase us jile main jhilein or daldal hai, adhik barsaat hone par gaanv pani se bhar jate hai tathaa fasal ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchataa he
 The ancient Aryans considered it to be a loss due to the flow of rivers and land, and hence the population first came to Banaras

 Whether buying bulls or plowing fields, sowing seeds or harvesting crops, the proverbs of the Ghaghha show their path
 ye kahavatein maukhik rup main bharat bhar main prachlit hai
 There are major differences regarding the birth and birthplace of the Ghagh

 No book written by Ghagh has been available till now
 haan, unki vaani kahawaton ke rup main bikhri hui he, jise anek logon ne sangrahit kiya he
 Among these, 'ghagh aur Bhadari' by Ramnaresh Tripathi is a very important collection
 ghaagh ke krishigyaan kaa puraa-puraa parichay unki kahawaton se miltaa he
 Their knowledge can be divided into various forms of fertilizers, deep plowing, bunding, time of sowing of crops, quantity of seeds, importance of cultivation of pulses and astrological knowledge, headings
 ghaagh kaa abhimath tha ki krishi sabase uttam vyavsaay he, jisamen kisaan bhoomi ko swayan jotata he : Or- khaadon ke sambandh main ghaagh ke vichaar atyant pusht the
 He made a commendable effort to apply manure of cow dung, rubbish, bone, indigo, linseed, etc
 in agriculture, as did the famous scientist Liebig of Germany around 1840 AD in connection with artificial fertilizers in the Eurap
 ghaagh kii nimnlikhit kahavatein atyant sargarbhit hai : Ghagh described deep plowing as the best plowing
 yadi khaad chhodkar gahari jot kar di jaay to kheti ko bada laabh pahunchataa he : Non-construction of the dam dissolves the essential elements of the land and reduces the yield
 isaliye kisaanon ko chahie ki kheton main band athwa mend baandhe, The Ghagh has also instructed the proper duration of sowing of crops and quantity of seeds
 unke anusaar prati bighas main paanch paseri gehun tathaa jau, chha: paseri matar, teen paseri chanaa, do ser mothi, arhar or maas, tathaa dedh ser kapaas, bajra bajri, saanvaan kodon or anjuli bhar sarson bokar kisaan duuna laabh uthaa sakate hai
 Not only this, he also mentions the distance between seeds when sowing seeds, such as thick-hemp flax, jowar at leaping frog, millet and cotton at pug step; Cucumber and reindeer should be sown on a deer leap
 kachche khet ko nahin jotna chahie, nahin to beej main ankur nahin aate
 If the fields are loose, they should be broken
 aajkal daalon kii kheti par vishesh bal diya jaataa he, kyonki unase kheton main nitrogen kii vruddhi hoti he
 Ghagh has clearly mentioned to increase the fertility of the fields by plowing the bipedals like Sanai, Nil, Urd, Mothi etc
 into the field
 kheton kii uchit samay par sinchai kii ore bhi unka dhyaan tha
 Like Bhadari, he was also an astrologer
 kis maas main kidar se hawa chale to kitni varsha ho, athwa kis maas kii varsha se kheti main keede lagenge, iskaa acha vyaavhaarik gyaan unhen tha
 Even today, farmers benefit from such proverbs
 bail hi kheti kaa muldhar he, at: ghaagh ne belon ke aavashyak gunon kaa savistaar varnan kiya he
 The wood and its quantity required for preparing the plow are also mentioned in their proverbs
 uplabdh kahawaton ke aadhaar par itnaa avashya kaha ja saktaa he ki ghaagh ne bhartiya krishi ko vyaavhaarik drushti pradaan kii
 His talent was versatile and he also had leadership abilities
 unke krishi sambandhi gyaan se aaj bhi anekanek kisaan laabh uthaate hai
 In scientific terms, all these proverbs are very pithy, so Ghagh has a special place in Indian agricultural science
