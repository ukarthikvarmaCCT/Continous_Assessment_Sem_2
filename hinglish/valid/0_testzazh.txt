 is kaanoon ko purvyaapee rup se stallin ke maamle par lagu kiya gaya tha jise vyapak rup se unhen chennai ke meyar pad se hataane ke uddeshy se uthaaye gaye kadam ke rup main dekha gaya tha
 The Madras High Court, however, called the statute ineffective, stating that statutory bodies were not retroactively "prevented" from enacting laws affecting the "fundamental rights" of the people
 haalaanki adaalat ne yah mana ki madras city nagar nigam adhinium, 1919 ke tahat ek vyakti lagaataar do kaarykalon ke liye meyar nahin ban saktaa he yadhyapi stallin ke vipareet pehle ke meyar sidhe taur par nirvaachit nahin hue the

 Opponents of the DMK, some political observers and the senior-most members of the DMK party criticize that Karunanidhi is trying to promote Stalin in an attempt to launch a political dynasty on the lines of the nehru-gandhi family

 However, DMK sources and those who have witnessed the political turmoil of the 70s and 80s deny this and say that Stalin has come forward on his own merit
 unka kahana he ki stallin apane kadamon ke boote aage bade hai, 1975 se hi unhen bahut kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he jab unhen misa ke tahat jail main band kiya gaya tha or apatkaal ke dauraan jail ke andar itani krurta se unki pitayee kii gayi thi ki unhen bachaane kii koshish main diemke party ke unke saathi kaidi kii maut ho gayi thi

 This was his fourth term as MLA when he was made a minister in the Karunanidhi cabinet, thus his progress is slow and steady
 ve aage bataate hai ki karunanidhi ne yahan tak ki apane anya putron emke mutthu or emke ajhagiri ko bhi galat kaaryon ke liye doshi paae jane par nishkasit kar diya tha

 These five dynasties were - Ghulam dynasty, Khilji dynasty, Tughlaq dynasty, Syed dynasty, and Lodhi dynasty
 inamen se chaar vansh multah turk the jabaki antim vansh afgaan tha
 Qutub-ud-din Aibak, the slave of Mohammed Ghauri, was the first Sultan of the slave dynasty
 aibak kaa samrajya puure uttar bharat tak failaa tha
 After this, the Khilji dynasty took over Central India but failed to organize the Indian subcontinent
 is sultanate ne na keval bahut se dakshin asia ke mandiron kaa vinaash kiya saath hi apavitra bhi kiya, par isane bhartiya-islamic vaastukala ke udai main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai

 After the assassination of Ghori, one of his Ottoman slaves Qutb-ud-din Aibak took power and became the first Sultan of Delhi
 qutub-ud-deen aibak ek gulam tha, jisane dilli sultanate kii sthapana kii
 He was originally Turk

 Iltutmish's power was temporary and was challenged by many Muslim rich
 kuch qutubi amiron ne uskaa saath bhi diya
 He strengthened his power by brutally suppressing many of his opponents

 vah apne naate-rishtedaaron, wajiron par hameshaa andeh karata tha, apane har shatru ko gambhirtha se letaa tha tathaa kai aise nirnay liye jisase aarthik kshetra main uthal-puthal ho gaya
 For example, he ordered copper coins to be replaced in place of silver coins
 yah nirnay asafal sabit hua kyoki logon ne apane gharon main jaali sikkon ko dhaalnaa shuru kar diya or usase apana jajia kar chukaane lage
 In another decision, he shifted his capital from Delhi to Devgiri in Maharashtra and forced the people of Delhi to move to Daulatabad
 jo sthanantarit hue unki maarg main hi mrityu ho gai
 The decision to shift the capital proved to be wrong as Daulatabad was a dry place due to which there was very little drinking water available according to the population there
 rajdhani ko phir se dilli sthanantarit kiya gaya
 Nevertheless, due to this order of Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Muslims of Delhi who came in large numbers did not return to Delhi
 muslimon ke dilli chhodkar dakkan jane ke kaaran bharat ke madhya or dakshini bhaagon main muslim jansankhya kaaphi bad gai
 Many Hindu and Jain temples of the Deccan region were broken, or desecrated, because of Muhammad bin Tughluq's decision; For example Swayambhu Shiva Temple and Thousand Pillar Temple

 He raised taxes heavily to compensate for this loss
 1338 main, uske apane bhattije ne malwa main baghawat kar di, jis par usne hamalaa kiya or uski khaal utaar di
 From 1339, Muslim subedars in the eastern parts and Hindu kings from the southern parts raised the flag of revolt and declared themselves independent from the Delhi Sultanate
 mohammad bin tughlaq ke paas in bagawaton se nipatane ke liye aavashyak sansaadhan nahin the, jisase uskaa samrajya sikudta gaya
 Historian Walford has written that during Muhammad bin Tughlaq's rule, India suffered the most famines when it tested copper coins
 1347 main, bahamani samrajya sultanate se swatantra ho gaya or sultanate ke mukaable dakshin asia main ek nayaa muslim samrajya ban gaya

 This Sunni Sultan also wrote that he did not tolerate the conversion of the Sunni community, nor did he bear the effort in which Hindus would rebuild their demolished temples
 usne likhaa he ki dand ke taur par bahut se shiya, mahadi or hinduon ko mrityudand sunaaya
 In his memoir, he has written as his achievement that he initiated many Hindus into Sunni Islam and gave them freedom from Jaziya tax and other taxes, which gave a grand welcome to those who accepted Islam
 iske saath hi, usne sabhi teenon staron par karon va jajia ko badhaakar apane purvavartiyon ke us faisle par roak laga diya jinhone hindu brahmanon ko jajia kar se mukti di thi
 He extensively recruited his rich and slaves
 firoz shah ke raaj ke yatnaa main kami tathaa samaaj ke kuch virgon ke saath kiye ja rahe pakshpaat ke khatm karne ke rup main dekha gaya, parantu samaaj ke kuch virgon ke prati ashishnutaa or utpeedan main badhottaree bhi hui

 taimur kaa bharat par shashan karne kaa uddeshy nahin tha
 He looted Delhi fiercely and set the entire city on fire

 During this time he collected a large amount of wealth, slaves and women and returned to Samarkand

 From 1414 to 1451 saiyad vansh ek turk rajvansh tha jisane dilli sultanate par 1415 se 1451 tak shashan kiya
 The invasion and plunder of the Tamrud had left the Delhi Sultanate in ruins, and little is known about the rule of the Syed dynasty

 Bahulal Lodi began his rule to expand the influence of the Delhi Sultanate by invading the Muslim Jaunpur Sultanate, and partly by a treaty
 iske baad, dilli se varanasi kaa kshetra waapas dilli sultanate ke prabhaav main tha
 After the death of Bahlul Lodi, his son Nizam Khan assumed power, renamed himself as Alexander Lodi and ruled from 1498 to 1517
