 jab chin ne china par qabza karnaa shuru kiya tab china main jhou rajvansh kaa keval naam maatr kaa niyantran tha or jhagadate rajyon kaa kaal chal rahaa tha
 The Chin dynasty came from one of the same quarreling states, the Chin kingdom
 sabase pehle chin ne kamazor jhou vansh ko samaapt kiya or phir baaqi ke chah rajyon ko nasht kar ke china kaa ekikaran kiya
 Despite being powerful, the Chin dynasty remained in power for a very short period of time and the Han dynasty emerged in China after that
 apane shasankaal main chin rajvansh ne vyapaar badhaayaa, krishi main unnati kii or sainya rup se apane samrajya ko surakshit kiya
 One big step in this was the removal of the Jagirdars, whose peasants in Zhou era used to be fascinated

 In China, this phenomenon is called 'book burning and scholar burial', for which the sentence in the Chinese language is 'fen Shu Kang Ru'
 jab bhi koi taanashaah vichaaron or buddhijiviyon ko kuchalanaa chahta he to chini samskruti main is suutaravakya kaa prayog hota he
 The government of the Chin dynasty was heavy and slow, but always adopted new techniques in military matters
 phir bhi ek shaktishaalee sena ke baavjood bhi chin rajvansh bahut kam samay ke liye chalaa
 When the first Chin emperor died in 210 BCE, his two ministers made his son sit on the throne thinking that through him they would rule themselves
 is iraade ke baavjood, in donon main aapas main ladaai ho gai, jis se ve donon or nayaa samraat, teenon hi apni jaanon se haath dho baithe

 bharat or anya vistaar main pracheen kaal main singhon kii prajati kaa mahatv rahaa he or lokvartaon main singh ko jangal kaa raja kahan jaataa he
 The lion is also mentioned in ancient symbols
 sanathan dharm main maan amba kaa vaahan singh he
 Later, the lion species began to become extinct not only in India but also in the spread of Asia and around 1900 only 15 lions were left in the Gujarat region
 tab junagarh ke tatkaaleen nawab dwaara gir kshetra ko singho ke liye arakshit ghoshit karke singho ke shikaar par pratibandh laga diya tha
 In ancient times, lions were also found all over India and other countries of Asia

 In 1900, there were only lions left in Gujarat and the number of living lions was only 15 when the then Nawab of Junagadh declared Gir Extension as a sanctuary and banned hunting
 uske baad gir main singho kaa sanvardhan hua he or singho kii sankhya main badhotaree hui he
 In the last few years, from the natural forests of Gir, the Singhs migrated to some of the expanses of Amreli district and made this extension their place of residence

 viranjan se keval rang hi nahin nikalataa, varan prakritik padaarthon se anek apdravya bhi nikal jate hai
 Many substances need to be bleached
 aise padaarthon main rooyee, vastra, linen, oon, resham, kaagaj lugdi, madhu, mom, tel, chini or anek anya padaarth hai
 The work of bleaches is often based on oxidation
 adhikansh viranjak chlorine par aadhaarit hai
 We have known the art of bleaching wool and cotton textiles since ancient times
 pracheen misravasi, unani, romavaasi tathaa phinishiavasi viranjit saamaan taiyaar karte the, par kaise karte the iskaa pataa aaj hamen nahin he
 Pliny mentions some trees and ashes of trees
 aisa maaloom hota he ki europe main dach log viranjan kii kala main adhik vikhyath the
 In the 14th century in England, there are descriptions of bleaching places
 18veen shatabdi main iskaa prachaar vastut: vyapak ho gaya tha
 At that time, the clothes were dipped in alkaline liquids for several days and washed and dried on the grass for several weeks
 iske baad vastron ko matthey main kai din dubaakar phir dhokar saaf karte the
 The bleaching business was actually founded in 1787 AD
 tab tak chlorine kaa avishkaar ho chukaa tha or vastron ke viranjan main yah bada prabhavakaari siddh hua tha
 Betaule was the first scientist who explicitly declared that chlorine gas could be used in the bleaching of textiles, and he referred to it in one of his essays, which appeared in the journal 'the Physique' in 1786 AD
 phir to iskaa upyog kai deshon main hone laga
 Chlorine gas was inconvenient for bleaching
 isse iske upyog main kuch sam tak acchhee pragati na ho saki
 It has been observed that chlorine can also be bleached when used by absorbing chlorine in the burning potash
 phir chlorine ko chooney main avashoshit kar viranjan churna taiyaar kiya gaya, jiskaa upyog aaj tak hota aa rahaa he
 Sodium hypochlorite and liquid chlorine are also being used in its place
 kachi rooyee main apdravya ke rup main mom, vasaml, pectin, ranjak, albuminoid or khanij lavan rahete hai
 Their quantity can be up to about five percent
 viranjan se ye apdravya bahut kuch nikal jate hai
 If cotton has not been bleached before, cotton yarn and clothing are also bleached to remove impurities
 kapaas ke soot ke viranjan ke liye soot ko teen se chaar pratishat soda aish, yaa do pratishat daahak soda, ke saath chah se aath ghante tak nune dabaav par ubaalte hai
 Then it is washed and treated with bleaching fluid for half to two hours
 use phir pani se dhokar hydrochloric amla yaa salphurik amla main dubaakar bhalee bhanti dho lete hai
 If the yarn is to be made completely white, then it is suspended in a weak solution of soap and takes some color
 ubaalane se soot ke adhikansh apdravya nikal jate hai
 If a little resin is mixed and boiled, the wax is usually removed
 yadi vastra viranjan kiya jaae, to usase mom ke saath saath ve padaarth bhi, jaise starch, magnesium lavan aadi, jo sajjikaran main prayukt hote hai, bahut kuch nikal jate hai
 After bleaching, the clothes turn white with light blue color
 yadi kapade par chheent kii chapai kerani ho, to vastron ko viranjit kar bilkul safed bananaa aavashyak hota he
 Bleaching of linen yarns is more complicated and wasteful, as the amount of impurities in such yarns is 20 percent or more, whereas the quantity of impurities in cotton does not exceed 5 percent
 san ke sooton main jo apdravya rahete hai, unamem ranjakon ke atirikt ek vishesh prakaar kaa mom, 'sanai mom', rahata he, jisapar kisi abhikarmak kii kriya kathin hoti he
 If the linen fabrics are to be bleached, then the difficulty increases further because the penetration of bleaches into such fabrics is somewhat difficult
 sanai ke sooton or vastron kaa viranjan praaia: vaise hi hota he jaise rooyee ke sooton or vastron kaa
 The only difference is that they have to be put on the grass and dried in the sun
 isamen samay bahut adhik lagata he
 Where cotton wool and textiles get bleached in less than a week, it takes at least six weeks for bleaching of cotton linen and clothing
 viranjan main laganevaala samay or kharch kam karne ke anek praytn hue hai, par unamem abhi yathochit safalataa nahin mili he

 Bleaching of jute fibers or textiles is also similar to cotton and linen fibers and textiles
 keval kshar kaa upyog inke saath nahin karte
 They are treated with sodium hypochlorite and wash them with acid
 puaalon kaa viranjan hydrogen paroxide ke vilyan main 12 ghante se lekar kai dinon tak dubaakar, phir salfurik amla kii kriya se kiya jaataa he
 Bleaching wool goods does not make them as white as cotton or linen, but if they are treated with sulfuric acid or hydrogen peroxide, they improve a lot
 upachaar ke baad soot ko dhokar latakaaya jaataa he
 It is then soaked and given a blue color in a solution in a room where sulfur dioxide is formed
 raat bhar saamaan ko vahaan rahane dete hai
 In the same way, the Jatavas also bleach the Romans or the Coochs
 sodium bisulphite ke kuch prabal vilyan main dubaakar rakhane se bhi oon kaa viranjan hota he
 The color returns to such bleached wool when washed with soap
 yadi hydrogen paroxide se viranjit kiya jaae or peeche ammonia yaa sodium silicket se kshareey bana liya jaae, to viranjan sthaayee hota he
 Black or brown wool cannot be made absolutely white by bleaching, but they can be made golden
 prakritik resham ke upar sericine, yaa resham gond, rahane ke kaaran vah dekhne main mand lagata he
 Sericin can last up to 19-25 percent
 sericine ko nikaalane ke liye, 30 pratishat bhaar ke sabun ko pani main dhulaakar usamen resham ko lagbhag 3 ghante tak kvathanank se nimna taap par tapaaya jaataa he
 This dissolves the sericin and gives a special shine on the fiber
 ab resham ko halke soda vilyan se dhokar vaanchit rang main rang lete hai
 One particular type of silk, hydrogen peroxide, is used for bleaching tussers
 yadi pakshiyon ke pankhons ko viranjit karnaa ho, to hydrogen paroxide ko alp ammonia daalkar, kshareey banaakar viranjit kiya ja saktaa he

 Om states that he was witness to the killing of Shanti by Mukesh in his previous birth
 mukesh use chunauti detaa he ki purvajanm kii baat par koi bhi adaalat vishwaas nahin karegi
 Just then, a young woman in the guise of peace comes there and says that just below the chandelier on the set, the proof of murder is buried - her body, which Mukesh had buried alive under the ground
 vah om ko mukesh par waar karne se roak detii he
 a heavy chandelier falls down and Mukesh gets subdued by it

 Its story revolves around Krishna, who has some powers from his father, Rohit Mehra
 rohit or nisha mehara kaa paanch saal kaa betaa krishna mehara se aicu test main kuch sawaal puchhne par uske shikshak ko lagata he ki krishna ke paas kuch asaadhaaran buddhi he
 When he tells this to his grandmother Sonia, he is afraid that the way he lost his son due to these powers, that he should not lose his grandson as well, so that he can give these grandchildren's powers to the world
 She goes to a village in a remote mountain to hide from
 kai saalon ke baad kuch log us gaanv main camp ke liye aate hai, isi dauraan priya glyder se girti rahati he, or krishna use bachaa letaa he, or is tarah pehali baar krishna kii mulaaqaat priya se hoti he
 Krishna falls in love with Priya, and at the same time Priya is very surprised to see Krishna climbing the mountain so easily
 jab priya apane ghar, singapore jaati he, to uski bos use or uski dost ko paanch din kaa bin-bataae chuttee lene ke liye naukari se nikaal detii he
 Then her friend, Honey, says that they were working during these five days and she tells her boss about Krishna and plans to show him about him on TV
 priya ko pataa hota he ki krishna usase pyaar karata he or use singapore main laane ke liye wo jhooth bol detii he ki use usase pyaar he or kahati he ki use singapore aa kar, usase shaadi karne ke liye uski maan se ijajad leni padegi
 Krishna's grandmother refuses, saying that people want to take advantage of her powers
 wo use bataati he ki uske pita rohit ko doctor siddhanth aryaa ek aise computer banane bolta he, jo bhavishya dekh sake, jisase ladaai ko roka ja sake, par baad main rohit ko pataa chalata he ki uskaa makasad acha karnaa nahin he, is kaaran wo mashin ko tod detaa he
 It is later revealed that Rohit died in the laboratory

 After knowing all this, Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers

 tabhi use ek tutaa mask dikai detaa he, wo apane jacket ko ulta kar mask or jacket pahan letaa he
 When a child asks for a name while helping, he reveals his real name, but stops in the middle
 us ghatana ke baad sabhi jagah "krish" naam fail jaataa he
 One day as Krishna removes his mask after teaching the goons a lesson, Kristen Lee sees him
 krishna use apni pahchaan chupaane bolta he, or wo mask use de kar inaam main mili paison se apni bahan kii surgery karaane bolta he
 Meanwhile, Priya gets to know that Krishna is Krishna by watching his camera video
 wo or hani ise tivi par dikhaa kar krishna ko sitara banane kii sochate hai
 After that the conversation goes on between Priya and Honey that if Priya does not fall in love with him, Krishna would never come here, and Krishna listens to all this and goes away
 par priya uske baad hani se kahati he ki use sach main krishna se pyaar ho gaya he
 Krishna thinks of going to his house and then Priya comes there, and then Priya realizes her mistake that Krishna deliberately wants to hide his identity
 or wo bos ko krish kii pahchaan duniya ko dikhaane se rokane kii koshish karti he
 Vikram Sinha has been searching for Krishna for many years
 jab krishna, priya se naaraaz ho kar hawaii adde par aata he, tabhi uski mulaaqaat vikram se hoti he or wo use bataata he ki uske pita, rohit mehara abhi bhi jivit hai or doctor siddhanth use bhavishya dekhne vaale mashin ke banane tak jivit rakhega
 After that he will use that machine in his evil deeds
 isi dauraan siddhanth kai saalon ke baad us mashin ko phir se banane main safal ho jaataa he
 When he uses her for the first time, he sees his future that Krish is about to kill him
 siddhanth is kaaran cristan ko maar detaa he, kyonki use lagata he ki wo krish he
 Krishna comes to her island to rescue her father from him
 waapas aakar jab siddhanth apana bhavishya phir se dekhtaa he to use phir se vahi cheez dikhaai detaa he
 He is stunned to see Krish alive in his island with CCTV
 krish jab andar aata he to kai saare gunde us par hamalaa karte hai, par wo sabhi ko haraa detaa he, tabhi vikram ke sir par siddhanth goli maar detaa he or dikhaata he ki priya or rohit uske kabje main hai
 Krish starts killing him and shortly before he dies, he asks Krish who he is
 krish apana mask nikaalata he or uske baad siddhanth kii maut ho jaati he
 He tells Rohit that he is his son and all three return to India
 rohit apane pita ke puraane computor kaa jaadu se baat karne ke liye istemaal karata he or bahut dur ek antariksh yaan dikhaai detaa he
 With this, the story ends

 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last emperor of the Mughal Empire in India and a noted poet of Urdu
 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana
 This order shows how big he was for hindu-muslim unity
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the
 According to literary critics, during the time of Zafar, where Mughal power was in decline, Urdu literature especially Urdu poetry was at its height
