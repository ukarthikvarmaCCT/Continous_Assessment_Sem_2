 Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin was one of the Russian-language poetical poets who is considered the best poet of Russian
 unhen aadhunik roosi kavita kaa sansthaapak bhi mana jaataa he
 We can understand Pushkin's short life span of 38 years by dividing it into 5 sections
 26 may 1799 ko unke janm se 1820 tak kaa samay balykaal or praarambhik sahitya rachana ko sametataa he
 The period from 1820 to 1824 is the exile period
 1824 se 1826 ke bich ve mikhayelovscoye main rahe
 He reached the peak of fame in 1826–1831, approaching the Tsar
 1831 se unki mrityu tak kaa kaal unke liye bada duhkhadaayi rahaa
 At the age of twelve, Pushkin was sent to study at Tsarskoyeselow's boarding school
 san 1817 main pushkin padhai puri kar saint petersburg aa gaye or videsh mantralay ke kaaryon ke atirikt unka sara samay kavita karne or mouj udaane main beetaa, isi dauraan sena ke noujvaan afasaron dwaara banaai gai saahitiyik sanstha greenlamp main bhi unhone janaa shuru kar diya tha, jahaan unki kavita kaa swaagat hua
 Using the freedom to express his views in a free environment, Pushkin wrote poems like Odd to Liberty, Chadayev and in the country
 dakshin main yekaterinoslav, kakeshas or kreemia kii apni yatraaon ke dauraan unhone khub padhaa or khub likhaa, isi bich ve biimaar bhi pade or general rayevski ke parivaar ke saath kakeshas or kreemia gaye
 This journey became memorable in Pushkin's life
 kakeshas kii khubasurat vaadiyon main ve romantic kavi byran kii kavita se parichit hue
 In 1823, he was sent to Odessa
 oddesa main jin do striyon se unki najdikiyaan raheen unamem ek thi ek sarb vyapaaree kii italian patni emilia rigenich or duusari thi praant ke governor general kii patni countes vorontsov
 These two women made a deep impression in Pushkin's life
 pushkin ne bhi donon se samaan bhav se prem kiya or apni kavitaayen bhi unhen samarpit kin
 But on the other hand, the increased proximity to the Countess was not in his interest
 unhen apni maan kii jaagir mikhayelovscoye main nirvasit kar diya gaya
 In the two years that Pushkin spent in this remote northern corner of Russia, he was mostly alone
 par yahi samay tha jab unhone yevgeni anegin or boris godunov jaisi vikhyath rachanaayen puri kin tathaa anek sundar kavitaayen likhin
 Finally, in 1826, at the age of 27, Pushkin was recalled from exile by Tsar Nicholas to St
 Petersburg
 mulaakaat ke dauraan jaar ne pushkin se us kathith shadyantr kii babat poocha bhi jisaki badaulat unhen nirvaasan bhogana padaa tha
 He remained suspicious in the eyes of power and his creations had to fall prey to the censors, but Pushkin's love for freedom continued
 san 1828 main masco main ek nrity ke dauraan pushkin kii bhent nathalya goncharova se hui
 In the spring of 1829 he proposed marriage to Natalya
 anek baadhaon ke baavjood san 1831 main pushkin kaa vivaah nathalya ke saath ho gaya
 Pushkin's married life was not happy
 isaki jhalak unke likhe patron main milti he, pushkin kaa takaraav nathalya goncharova ke ek diwane francisi da'antes se hua jo jaar nicholas kaa darbari tha
 It is said that d'antes had fallen in love with Natalya
 da'antes ne nathalya kii bahan catherine se vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 He and Natalya then met in hiding, and the conditions worsened
 yah pushkin ko sahan nahin hui or vah da'antes ko dwandv yuddh kaa nimantran de baitha
 In a duel war on 27 January 1837, Pushkin was badly wounded by d'antes' bullets and died two days later on 29 January 1837 at the age of 38
 pushkin kii achaanak hui maut se sansani fail gai
 a crowd of around fifty thousand people, including students, workers and intellectuals, had gathered in St
 Petersburg to pay tribute to the poet, leaving the so-called nobles of erstwhile Russian society
 keval 37 saal jikar pushkin ne sansar main apana aisa sthaan bana liya jise unhone apane shabdon main kuch is tarah vyakt kiya he: i have installed apana alokik smarak Won't be able to ignore her jansamanya kii koi bhi raah

 ’ After some time, on the day of Vaishakh Shukla Panchami in AD 686, in the middle of the day, Visheshdevi gave birth to a very beautiful, divinely-armed child in the ultimate light

 His maternal power was so unique that at his prayer the Alavai river, which flowed far away from his village, changed its course and started flowing near the village of Kaladi, which facilitated his mother in river bathing
 kuch samay baad inaki mata ne inke vivaah kii sochi
 But Acharya Shankar wanted to stay away from the mess of householder
 ek jyotishi ne janm-patri dekhakar bataaya bhi tha ki alpaayu main inaki mrityu kaa yoga he
 Knowing this, Acharya Shankar's spirit of public service had become strong by taking retirement
 sanyas ke liye unhone maan se hath kiya or balak shankar ne 7 varsh kii aayu main sanyas grahan kar liya
 Then to get the highest goal of life, he got out of the house with permission from the mother

 'yahi sab sochate-sochate pahunch jate hai acharya apane ghar ke daravaaje par
 After getting Acharya's call, the housekeeper opens the door
 acharya sidhe pahonchte hai matrushaiya ke paas
 On seeing the son in the form of a monk, the tears of the mother's eyes start to slip
 isi kram me mata kaa praanant ho jaataa he
 The soul of Matashree was stuck waiting eagerly for his son
 idhar aankhe putr kaa darshan karti hai udhar duusare hi kshan praan apni nishkarshan kriya se unki kaaya ko shav kaa rup de dete hai
 Acharya Shankar has taken initiation of renunciation, he has become a transcendent
 shastranusaar ve agni sparsh nahin kar sakate
 In front of them, like a fierce religious Sursa, he stands face to face
 yadi ve matashri ko mukhaagni dete hai to sanyas dharm se chyut hote hai
 If they do not offer fire, the sons are dissuaded from religion
 kuch samay ke liye acharya kaa sanyasi chitt unke man se kudakar bhaag jaataa he
 The general mind gets replaced in its place
 matra shav ko dekhakar ve ek saamaanya maanav kii bhaanti vilkhane lagate hai
 They are lost in the past with the hands of Matashree
 sochate hai 'inhen haathon se meri itani seva kii thi
 Today these hands have become so dependent
 bachapan me purna nadi main ve inhen haathon se mujhe mel -mel kar nahalaati thi
 i used to run away to play with fellow kids while feeding
 ve mujhe daudkar pakad laati thim or inhen haathon se khilaati thim
 With these hands, she used to swim on my body daily

 But after i became a monk, she broke down completely

 'acharya Shankar descends from past to present
 isi samay grihasevika unke kaan main fusfusaati he,`matashri ke antyeshti kriya main aapke namboodiri parivaar ke log bhaag nahin lenge
 The reason for their non-cooperation is that they consider this act of yours as against scripture and against tradition
 kehete hai 'sanyasi jab grih tyaag kar detaa he to uskaa grih prapanch me lautnaa shaastra viruddh he
 Fire touch is completely forbidden for him
 ham log aise shaastra viruddh kaary main acharya shankar kaa saath nahin de sakate
 Acharya gets excited for a moment after listening to Sevika
 unki samaj main nahin aata he ki akele ve mata kaa shav lekar shmashaan tak kaise jaayenge
 For some time they become confused
 sahasaa unke man main ek samaadhaan kaundhta he
 'if the funeral of the mother's body is not taken at the crematorium, if the funeral is done in the house premises itself, what can be the objection? ʼ aisa kuch bhav acharya ke man main aata he
 Sagotri people are enjoying the dilemma of Acharya from a distance
 vipatti ke in kshanon main koi unka saath nahin detaa he
 Finally, Acharya Shankar decorates the pyre in front of his house
 kisi tarah mata ke shav ko chita par sthapit karte hai
 Taking a fire pitcher in his hand, orbiting the pyre, he lit the body
 acharya grih parisar ko hi shmashanghar me parivartit kar dete hai
 Looking at the flames from the pyre, Acharya feels as if Agni Dev is marching towards Pitraloka with his mother's subtle body
 kramshah chita kii lapten shant ho jaati hai par acharya kaa man apane sagotriyo ke liye khinn ho jaataa he
 Think, in such heavy calamities, our sagotrios did not take out a word of sympathy from the mouth
 acharya shankar kii isi maansikta se ek shaap shabd hota he,"ab is gotra ke log meri tarah shavadah shmashaan ghat par na karke apane ghar ke saamne hi karenge
 According to the 'mrisha na ho devi sage vani' doctrine, in the Namboodari Brahmins in the village of Kalati in Kerala, the corpse is still performed in front of the house
 ve kerala se lambii padayatra karke narmada nadi ke tat par sthit omkarnath pahunche
 There, Guru Gobindapad started receiving yoga education and Advaita Brahman knowledge
 teen varsh tak acharya shankar advait tatv kii sadhana karte rahe
 After that, with the permission of Guru, he went out to see Kashi Vishwanath
 jab ve kaashi ja rahe the ki ek chandal unki raah main aa gaya
 When he got angry and asked Chandal to move away, Chandal said- 'O Muni! You are neglecting a divine being who is in the body, therefore you are a Abraham
 atev mere maarg se aap hat jaayen
 Acharya Shankar, listening to Chandaval's devani, was very impressed and said - "you have given me knowledge, so you have become my guru
" ’ yah kahkar acharya shankar ne unhen pranaam kiya to chandal ke sthaan par shiv tathaa chaar devon ke unhen darshan hue
 During a few days stay in Kashi, he went to meet Acharya Mandan Mishra in the city of Mahishmati
 acharya mishra ke ghar jo paaltu maina thi vah bhi veda mantron kaa uccharan karti thi
 Acharya Shankar went to Mishraji's house and defeated him in scripture
 pati acharya mishra ko harata dekh patni acharya shankar se boleen- ‘mahatman! abhi aapane aadhe hi ang ko jeeta he
 Only by defeating me with your tips will you be called victorious
 ’ Then Bharti, the wife of Mishraji, started questioning Kamasastra
 kintu acharya shankar to bal-brahmacharee the, at: kaam se sambandhit unke prashnon ke uttar kahan se dete? is par unhone bharti devi se kuch dinon kaa samay maanga tathaa par-kaaya main pravesh kar us vishay kii sari jaankaree praapt kii
 After this Acharya Shankar also defeated Bharti in debate
 kaashi main pravaas ke dauraan unhone or bhi bade-bade gyani panditon ko shastrarth main parrast kiya or guru pad par pratishthit hue
 Many disciples took initiation from him
 iske baad ve dharm kaa prachaar karne lage
 He also composed many texts while engaging in Vedanta propaganda
 advait brahmavaadi acharya shankar keval nirvishesh brahm ko satya maanate the or brahmagyaan main hi nimagn rahete the
 Once he was going to Manikarnika Ghat with his disciples to bathe in a very narrow street in Brahma Muhurta
 raste main ek yuvati apane mrit pati kaa sir god main liye vilaap karti hui baithi thi
 The disciples of Acharya Shankar prayed to the woman to remove her husband's body and give it a way, but the woman continued to cry by ignoring him
 tab swayan acharya ne usase vah shav hataane kaa anurodh kiya
 Hearing his request, the woman said- 'O sannyasin! You are repeatedly asking me to remove this body
 aap is shav ko hi hat jane ke liye kyon nahin kehete?’ yah sunakar acharya bole- ‘he devi! aap shok main kadaachit yah bhi bhul gai ki shav main swayan hatane kii shakti hi nahin he
 'the woman immediately replied-' Mahatma, in your eyes, Brahm, the absolute power, is the doer of the world
 phir shakti ke bina yah shav kyon nahin hat saktaa?’ us stri kaa aisa gambhir, gyaanamay, rahasypurna vaakya sunakar acharya vahiin baith gaye
 He found a tomb
 ant:chakshu main unhone dekha- sarvatra aadyashakti mahamaya lila vilaap kar rahi hai
 His heart was filled with inexplicable joy and the wordy word of maternal veneration from the mouth burst into stotra
 ab acharya shankar aise mahaasaagar ban gaye, jisamen advaitvaad, shuddhadvaitvaad, vishishta dwaitvaad, nirgun brahm gyaan ke saath sagun saakaar kii bhakthi kii dharaayen ek saath hiloren lene lageen
 He realized that the divine, nirguna on the advaita land of knowledge is the formless brahm, the same is true on the land of dvaita
 unhone nirgun or sagun donon kaa samarthan karke nirgun tak pahunchne ke liye sagun kii upasna ko aprihaary seedhi mana
 On the meeting ground of knowledge and devotion, it was also realized that knowledge is the ultimate achievement of all spiritual practices
 unhone ‘brahman satyam jaganmithyaa’ kaa udghosh bhi kiya or shiv, parvati, ganesh, vishnu aadi ke bhakthiraspurn stotra bhi rache, ‘soundarya lahari’, ‘vivek chudamani’ jaise shreshthatam granthon kii rachana kii
 Wrote the departed trilogy also

 He traveled across the Asetu Himalaya Sampoorna Bharata and established four monasteries and bound the entire country into an unbroken thread of cultural, religious, philosophical, spiritual and geographical unity
 unhone samast maanav jati ko jivanmukti kaa ek sutara diya- That is, be a gentleman gentleman, be a gentleman peace
 shantjan bandhanon se mukt hon or mukt anya janon ko mukt karen
 After fulfilling his purpose, he left this mortal body at the tender age of thirty three years
 shankaracharya ek mahaan samanvayvaadee the
 He is credited with re-establishing and revealing Hinduism
 ek taraf unhone advait chintan ko punerjeevit karke sanathan hindu dharm ke darshanik aadhaar ko sudrudh kiya, to duusari taraf unhone jansamanya main prachlit murtipuja kaa auchity siddh karne kaa bhi prayaas kiya
 In order to provide a firm foundation for Sanatan Hinduism, he also partially adopted the opinion of the anti-panth
 shankar ke mayawad par mahayan buddha chintan kaa prabhaav mana jaataa he
 On this basis, he has been called the elusive Buddha
 aadi shakaracharya ji maharaj kii 108 foot kii murti omkareshwar jila khandwa madhyapradesh main sthapit kii ja rahi he Citing many European scholars, Lucian Blaga understands that Adi Shankaracharya is 'the greatest metaphysical scholar of all time'

 It was engraved by Kalingaraj Kharavel

 According to this, the kings of the independent kingdom of Kalinga were Cheti or Chedi Kshatriyas of the ancient 'ail dynasty'
 chedi vansh main 'mahamedhvahan' naam kaa pratapi raja hua, jisane mauryon kii nirbalata se laabh uthaakar kaling main apana swatantra shashan sthapit kiya
 The third generation of Mahamedhavahana was Kharavela, whose account is vividly mentioned in the Hathigumpha inscription
 kharvel jain dharm kaa anuyaayi tha or sambhavtah uske samay main kaling kii bahusankhyak janata bhi vardhaman mahavir ke dharm ko apana chuki thi
 According to the inscription of Hathigumpha, the first fifteen years of Kharavela's life were spent in the study of learning
 is kaal main usne dharm, arth, shashan, mudrapaddati, kaanoon, shastrasanchalan aadi kii shiksha praapt kii
 At the age of fifteen, he was appointed to the post of crown prince and after being in this position for nine years, at the age of twenty-four he rose to the throne of Kalinga
 raja banane par usne 'kalingadhipati' or 'kaling chakravarti' kii oopaadhiyaan dhaaran kin
 In the second year of the coronation, he attacked on the west side and, ignoring King Satakarni, he plagued the city of Moosic on the banks of Kanhavena

 Andhra was also one of the territories which became independent from the subjugation of the Mauryas

 While advancing in Uttarapath, his army attacked the fort of Gorathagiri located in the hills equal to one and after conquering it reached the Rajgriha

 magadh ke raja ko usne apane pairon par girane ke liye vivash kiya or raja nand kaling se mahavir swami kii jo murti patliputra le gaya tha, use vah phir se kaling waapas le aayaa
 Apart from this idol, many other loots were taken from Kharavela Magadha to his kingdom and he used it to build a huge temple in Bhubaneswar, which is also mentioned in a handwritten copy of the Brahma Purana in Orissa
 magadh ke jis raja ko kharvel ne apane charnon par girane ke liye vivash kiya tha, anek itihaaskaaron ke anusaar uskaa naam bahestimit tha
 He has also tried to read the name of this king in the Hathigumpha inscription
 par sab vidwaan is paath se sahamat nahin hai
 Mr
 Jaiswal, assuming the name of the king of Magadha as mentioned in the Hathigumpha inscription, is arguably synonymous with Pushyamitra Sunga and it is believed that Kalingaraja Kharavel attacked and defeated Sungavanshi Pushyamitra
 par anek aitihaasik hathigumpha main aaye naam ko na bahestimit sweekaar karne ko udyat hai or na hi pushyamitra ke saath milaane ko
 But there is no doubt that according to the Hathigumpha inscription, Kharavela had also conquered Magadha by invading Uttarapath and forced the king there to bow before him

 Asir province, known as Mintaqah Asir in formal Arabic, is a province in the southwest corner of Saudi Arabia
 isaki ek choti si sarhad yaman ke desh ke saath bhi lagati he
 Asir province is named after a confederation of tribes living here
 rajdhani abaha ke alaava khamis mushait , qal xxrep 4 a t bishah or bariq yahan ke kuch anya pramukh shahar hai
 The Asir region is situated on a high plateau where more than the rest of Saudi Arabia receives rain
 sarvat pahadiyaan is praant se guzarati hai or desh kaa sabase unchaa pahaad, jabal saudah, isi praant main sthit he
 This rainfall mainly falls twice a year - first in March – April and then in summer
 taapmaana bahut girtaa-utarataa he
 In the afternoon, there is often more than 30 ° c heat whereas in the morning it can go around zero
 subah ke samay koharaa padana aam he
 Due to the availability of water from rain and fog, dense angular forests are also present in some areas, although wind and sun are very dry on the open stone areas
 aseer main genhu or falon kii kheti chalati he or aadhunik kaal main sinchai acchhee hone se is main vistaar hua he
 Asir province is divided into 6 districts: aseer praant ke log isi ilaake main prachinkaal se basane vaale qabeelon ke vanshaj hai
 These include the tribal confederation named 'asir' or 'asariah', after whom the entire region is named
 inke alaava yahan qahtaan, bariq / bareg, bal-garn, shahran, bani shahar, rijaal alma, rijaal al-hajr, bal-asamaar, bal-ahmer or anya qabeele bhi yahan basate hai
 The people here speak some ancient dialects of Arabic language among themselves
 aseer ke log apane nivas- sthaan ke hisaab se teen guton main baante gaye hai: unche pathaar ke 'saraat' qabeele, tihamah qabeele or purvi registani kshetra main basane vaale badiyah qabeele
 Many large tribes have Sarat, Tihamah and Badiyah branches
 pahari kshetron main basane waalon ke taur-tareeqe najd kshetra ke logon se milte-julate hai
 Asir's culture and neighborhood are similar to neighboring Yemen

 sankhyatmak vishleshan main runga-kuta vidhiyaan saadhaaran avakal samikarnon ko hal karne kii punraritimulak vidhiyaan hai
 These were developed around 1900 AD by German mathematicians c Runga and MW Kuta
 yah ek vidhi nahin balki isamen kai vidhiyaan hai
 It is also called the 'classical runga-kuta Method' or often "RK4"
 yah chaar order vaali vidhi he
 Suppose a simple differential equation is the following: yah vidhi nimnlikhit sutara se samajhi ja sakati he: n = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,
 
 
, And h kaa uchit dhanatmak maan lekar is vidhi ko barbar prayog karke t ke kisi bhi maan ke liye y kaa sannikat maan nikaal sakate hai
 Let dxdt = - tx { \ displaystyle { \ frac {dx} {dt}} = { \ frac {-t} {x}}} be solved
 diya hua he ki t = 0 x = 1 { \ displaystyle t=0 \ , \ , \ ,x=1} The exact solution of this differential equation is t 2 + x 2 = 1 { \ displaystyle t ^ {2} + x ^ {2} = 1}
 ham h = 0, 1 { \ displaystyle h=0,1} lekar iskaa hal nikaalte hai
 This gives x = 0, 994987426585 { \ displaystyle x = 0,994987426585} at t = 0, 1 { \ displaystyle t = 0,1}
 isi tarah ham t ke vibhinn maanon ke liye x kaa maan praapt karte jate hai, jo nimnaankit sarini main dikhaaye gayi hai- Note that a pure solution to this differential equation will yield x = 0 { \ displaystyle x = 0} at t = 1 { \ displaystyle t = 1}, while x = 0
0488018582123 { \ displaystyle x = 0
0488018582123} is obtained by this method
 Which is very close to pure value
 isse bhi adhik parishuddh maan kii gananaa ke liye 'step sies' ko 0
1 ke bajaay or kam rakhana padegaa
 These methods are generalized forms of RK4
 yah nimnlikhit rup main he: Where kisi vishesh vidhi ko praapt karne ke liye pehle s tay kerani padati he
 The coefficients aij, bi and ci are determined accordingly
 matrix ko runga-kuta matrix kehete hai
 bi and ci are called weights and nodes
 ye sankhyaayein nimnlikhit sarini ke rup main vyavasthit kii jaatin hai jise 'bujar tebul' kehete hai
 Runga Kuta method will be uniform if yadi ham kisi vidhi ko p order vaala bananaa chaahate hai to kuch or aavashyaktaayen isamen jud jaati hai
 For example, to get the 2-step and 2-order method, the following condition would be: shaikhpura main bharat ke bihar rajya ke antargat purnia mandal ke arriya jile kaa ek gaanv he

 saamaajik media ke vyapak vistaar ke saath-saath iske kai nakaaratmak paksh bhi ubharkar saamne aa rahe hai
 An incident in Meerut last year exposed the dangerous side of social media
 vakya yah hua tha ki us kishor ne fesabook par ek aisi tasviir aplod kar di jo behad aapattijnak thi, is tasviir ke aplod hote hi kuch ghante ke bheetar ek samudaay ke saikadon gussaye log sadakon par utaar aae
 Until the administration could understand what is Majra, rioting conditions were created in Meerut
 prashasan ne halaat ko bigadne nahin diya or jald hi vah photo aplod karne vaale tak bhi pahunch gaya
 People believe that the objectionable behavior of this era of new social media is different from the objectionable behavior of traditional media

 While this is not true, if tried, the abuser on social media can be caught and the recurrence of these incidents can also be prevented

 In addition, one of its branches is known as Bagheli in Baghelkhand
 'avadh' shabd kii vyutpatti "ayodhya" se he
 One of this name was in the reign of the Diocese
 tulsidas ne apane "maanas" main ayodhya ko 'avadhpuri' kaha he
 The old name of this area was also 'kosal', which has been valued since ancient times

 Currently, researchers estimate that more than 60 million people speak Awadhi
 uttar pradesh ke 19 jilon- sultanpur, amethi, barabanki, pratapgarh, elahabaad, kaushambi, fatehpur, raibareli, unnav, lakhanu, hardoi, sitapur, lakhimpur khiri, baharich, shravasti, balrampur, gonda, faijabad va ambedkar nagar main puri tarah se yah boli jaati he
 While it is used in some areas of 6 districts - Jaunpur, Mirzapur, Kanpur, Shahjahanpur, Basti and Banda
 bihar ke 2 jilon ke saath padosi desh nepal ke 8 jilon main yah prachlit he
 Similarly, in other countries of the world - Mauritius, Trinidad and Tubago, Fiji, Guyana, Suriname, Australia, New Zealand and Holland also have millions of Awadhi speakers

 Many prominent texts including the Ramacharitmanas by Tulsidas and Padmavat by Malik Muhammad Jayasi have been given by this dialect

 This is also the work place of Umrao Jaan, Acharya Narendra Dev and Ram Prakash Dwivedi

 isi parivaar kii ek kanya kaa vivaah dakshin korea ke rajgaraane main arsa pehle hua tha
 Vishwanathha Tripathi, a senior critic of Hindi, has written an important book on Awadhi language and grammar
 phahyan ne bhi apane vivaran main ayodhya kaa zikr kiya he
 Today's Awadhi is coming under the influence of Khadi Boli and English due to migration and culturalization
 avadhi ke pashchim main pashchimi varg kii bundeli or braj kaa, dakshin main chhattisgadhi kaa or purv main bhojpuri boli kaa kshetra he
 To the north of this is the Terai of Nepal, in which there are settlements of tribals with degrees, whose language is completely different from Awadhi
 hindi khadiboli se avadhi kii vibhinnata mukhya rup se vyakarnatmak he
 There is absolutely no lack of the subject "ne" in the subject factor
 anya parasargon ke praaia: do rup milte hai- hrasv or deergh
 
 sangyaaon kii khadiboli kii tarah do vibhaktiyaan hoti hai- vikari or avikari
 In the non-inflected inflection, the noun has its original form and in the vikari the suffix "n" is added to the plural
 karta or karm ke avikari rup main vyanjananth sangyaaon ke ant main kuch boliyon main ek hrasv "u" kii shruti hoti he 
 But of course it is not a complete vowel and linguists find it in the whispering vowel "e" and the eloquent "a"
 sangyaaon ke bahudhaa do rup, hrasv or deergh milte hai
 Apart from these, another form is found in the eastern part of Awadhi region
 avadhi main kahin-kahin khadiboli kaa hrasv rup bilkul lupt ho gaya he; yatha billi, dibbi aadi rup nahin milte belia, dibia aadi hi prachlit hai
 The pronoun has Khadiboli and Braj's "mera Tera" and "mero Tero" forms in Awadhi for "more Tor"
 inke atirikt purvi avadhi main pashchimi avadhi ke "so" "jo" "ko" ke samanaantar "se" "je" "ke" rup praapt hai
 The process of future forms in action is quite different from that of standing
 khadiboli main praaia: pracheen vartmaan ke tadbhav roopon main- ga-gi-ge jodakar rup banaae jate hai
 The future forms in Braj are based on the forms of the ancient future
 
 In Awadhi, often the form of the future is dependent on the ancient forms of poetry
 avadhi kii pashchimi boliyon main keval uttampurush bahuvachan ke rup tavyatant roopon par nirbhar hai
 Like the rest of Braj on the ancient future
 kintu madhyavarti or purvi boliyon main kramash: tavyatant roopon kii prachurtaa badhati gai he
 Khadiboli has the suffix "no" for the noun and "no" in Braj
 parantu avadhi main iske liye "ba" pratyay he 
 In Awadhi, the allegorical singular form ends in "wa"
 bhojpuri main iske sthaan par "l" main ant honevaale rup milte hai 
 One of the main distinguishing features of Awadhi is the past tense form of transitive verb of the other male singular
 ya-"si" main ant honevaale rup avadhi ko chhodkar anyatra nahin milte
 The auxiliary verbs of Awadhi are based on the forms "ha", "ah" and "bata'i"
 upar likhe lakshanon ke anusaar avadhi kii boliyon ke teen varg maane gaye hai : pashchimi, madhyavarti or purvi
 The proximity of the western dialect is due to the influence of Braj and the influence of Bhojpuri on the eastern
 inke atirikt bagheli boli kaa apana alag astitv he
 From the point of view of development, Awadhi is situated between Braj, Kannauji and Bhojpuri
 braj kii vyutpatti nishchay hi shauraseni se tathaa bhojpuri kii magadhi praakrit se hui he
 As Awadhi's position is in between these two, it would be appropriate to assume its exit from the half-century
 khed he ki ardhamagadhi kaa hamen jo pracheenatam rup miltaa he vah paanchavin shatabdi isvi kaa he or usase avadhi ke rup nikaalane main kathinaayee hoti he
 In Pali language, there are often such forms from which the development of Awadhi forms can be proved
 sambhavat: ye rup pracheen ardhamagadhi ke rahe honge
 There are two branches of ancient Awadhi literature: one is Bhaktikavya and the other is Premakhyana poetry
 bhakthikavy main goswami tulsidas kaa "ramcharitamanas" avadhi sahitya kii pramukh kriti he
 Its language is full of Sanskrit vocabulary
 "ramcharitamanas" ke atirikt tulsidas ne anya kai granth avadhi main likhe hai
 Laldas's "awadhbilas" comes under this devotional literature
 isaki rachana sanwat 1700 main hui
 Apart from these, many more devout poets wrote books related to Ramabhakti
 sant kaviyon main baba malukadas bhi avadhi kshetra ke the
 Most of his bani is in Awadhi
 inke shishy baba mathuradas kii bani bhi adhiktar avadhi main he
 Although Baba Dharnidas belonged to Chhapra district, his book was published in Awadhi
 kai anya sant kaviyon ne bhi apane upadesh ke liye avadhi ko apanaaya he
 The most well-known book in Premaakhyan poetry is "padmavat", composed by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, which was composed 34 years before "ramcharitmanas"
 dohe chaupai kaa jo kram "padmavat" main he praaia: vahi "maanas" main miltaa he
 Muslim writers have revealed the secret of Sufism in the Premiakhyan poetry
 is kavy kii parampara kai sau varshon tak chalati rahi
 Manjhan's "madhumalati", Usman's "chitravali", Alam's "madhavanal Kamakandala", Nurmuhammad's "indravati" and Sheikh Nisar's "yusuf Julekha" are compositions of this tradition
 shabdaawalee kii drushti se ye rachanaayen hindu kaviyon ke granthon se is baat main bhinn hai ki isamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii utani prachurtaa nahin he
 Most of the compositions in ancient Awadhi literature are on subjects like patriotism, social reform, and mainly satirical
 kaviyon main pratapanarayan mishra, balbhadra dikshit "padhis", vanshidhar shukla, chandrabhushan dvivedi "ramai kaaka", guru prasad singh "mrigesh" or shardaprasad "bhushundi" vishesh ullekhneey hai
 An important modern text of the manner of "ramcharitmanas" in the tradition of management is the "krishnayana" of Dwarikaprasad Mishra
 isaki bhashaa or style "maanas" ke hi samaan he or granthkaar ne krishnacharit praaia: usee tanmayata or vistaar se likhaa he jis tanmayata or vistaar se tulsidas ne ramcharita ankit kiya he
 Mishra ji has proved through the composition of this book that Awadhi's nature for management is still as attainable as it was in Tulsidas's time
 avadhi lok sahitya kii ek samrudh parampara he
