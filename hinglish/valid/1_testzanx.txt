Today, the King Salamat himself is not one of my hands, when i have taken both my hands in my hand, then what do i care? ”aurangzeb did not expect this clever reply, but he was very pleased with this wise presence
 , The words Yadunath Sarkar has written about this 'title' in his Jaipur history - unquestionably - "the new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased
 with this youthful prince's feats before Khelna that he cried out, "you are more than a man, you are sawa- ie, a hundred and twenty five per cent hero ' kuch duusare strot batalaate hai 'savai' kii oopaadhi aurangzeb dwaara nahin balki badshaah farrukh sier dwaara inhen di gayi thi

 Jai Singh received this award for the six-year 'hard service' of the emperor! After this, when Shahzada Bidarbakht became the Subedar of Malve, he made him the Deputy Subedar there, respecting the services of Jaisingh, which Aurangzeb immediately 'disallowed' and wrote a decree that Ainda even a Hindu to a minor faujdar
 Neither should be made
 ' The irony is that Aurangzeb, who once honored him by calling him 'sawai', was later so annoyed and prejudiced that he issued this insulting command - "by not giving Jayasinha a seat on Masnad, laying on the ground below"

 With the inspiration, encouragement and command of Emperor Akbar, this book was composed five times as a result of extraordinary hard work
 yadhyapi abulafajl ne anya pustaken bhi likhi hai, kintu use sthaayee or vishwavyaapee kirti in-e-akabari ke aadhaar par hi uplabdh ho saki
 According to the narration of Abulafzl himself, his aim was to preserve the memory of the great emperor and guide the curious

 The fourth section describes the social condition of Hindus and their religion, philosophy, literature and science, foreign invaders and prominent travelers, and famous Muslim saints, and the fifth part compiles Akbar's submissions and author's epilogue

 Abulfazl was also possible in other scholarly periods, but a text like iin-e-akbari was possible only in the period of Akbar, because the extraordinary coordination and extraordinary emperor's complete co-ordination was made possible by the inspiration of lofty feelings at the intellectual level

 It is the science of measurement and its applications
 maapvigyaan bhautikee kii vah shakha he jisamen shuddh maap ke bare main hamen gyaan hota he
 In metrology, basically we discuss about the three quantities, that is, mass, length, and time, and with the knowledge of these three quantities, we measure other quantities, such as density, volume, force, and power
 maapvigyaan dwaara aparivartaneey maanakon kaa nirdesh hi nahin miltaa, varan inhen kaayam bhi rakhaa jaataa he
 By these standards, we also measure and compare the properties of objects
 doosraa paksh yah he ki kisi kaarivishesh ko drushti main rakhkar maapvigyaan se aise tareeke praapt hote hai jinase tulanaayen kaaphi ucch str kii shuddhta tak kii ja saken
 In the modern sciences and industries, the above basic comparisons must be very pure
 maap purnataya thik nahin hoti or nishchit rup se usamen kuch na kuch praayogic galati sadaa hi rahati he
 Nowadays the following approximations of accuracy are found in the more fundamental functions of metrology: antarrashtriya adirup kilogram ke do platinum iridium namoonon kii tulana main : 10,00,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Compared to ordinary chemical weights: one part in 10,00,000
 sookshmmapi tula dwaara chote chote bhaaron kii tulana main : 10,00,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Compared to two yards or standard meters: one part per 1,00,00,000
 antya maanak kii rekhamanak se tulana main : 10,00,000 main ek bhaag
 Determination of normal volume and density: one part per 10,000

 Wavelength as a natural standard - subsequent progress has changed our beliefs to a great extent

 But the best feature of this standard is that it is beyond the possibility of long-term variance, whereas all other types of standards are used
 prithvi ke kisi bhi bhaag main ham is prakritik maanak kii sahaayta se dravyatmak maanakon kaa satyaapan kar sakate hai
 If the fluid parameters are to be compared to the prototype meter by sending it to the international central laboratory, then there is a possibility of loss in traffic, but with the help of natural standard we can do this work in our own laboratory

 Michelson's interferometer was also used to know how many light waves come in a standard meter and what is their number? Michaelsen identified the international meter at 150 centigrade heat and 760 mm 0 atmosphere pressure, which is housed at the International Institute of Measurements and Weights near Paris, in the cadmium red lines
 yah maan 15,53,163
5 he, jo 2 ́106 main ek seemaa tak sahi he
 Subsequent experiments by Fabri Para revealed that this number is 15,53,164
13 in a meter in dry air at 15 ° c and 760 millimeter pressure
 yadi micelson ke prayogen main jalawaashp ke prabhaav ke liye sanshodhan kiya jaay, to yah spasht hota he ki donon ke maan main koi antar nahin he
 There is evidence that the fluid standard yard has probably decreased by 0

 The warrior castes, after the revolution of 1857, was the title made to the military officers of British India
 unhone samast jatiyon ko "yoddha" va "gaiyr-yoddha" jatiyon ke rup me vargeekrut kiya tha
 According to him, the well-bodied and brave "yoddha Varna" was more suitable for fighting, while the "non-combatant" people with a relaxed lifestyle preferred the British government as unsuitable for fighting
 ek vaikalpik pariklpana yah bhi he ki 1857 kii kranti me adhiktar british prashikshit bhartiya sainik hi the jiske falswaroop sainik bhartee prakriya un logon kii pakshdhar thi jo british hukumat ke bafadaar rahe the atah bengal army main khadi kshetra se hone vaali bhartee yaa to kam kar di gayi yaa roak di gayi thi
 The above notion was already present in the four-dimensional system of Vedic Hindu society of India as "kshatriya varna" which literally means "warrior caste"
 bharat par adhikaar sthapit karne kii prakriya main angreji hukumat ko jahaan kai kshetron main ghor virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha vahiin anya kuch kshetron ko unhone aasaani se kaabo me kar liya tha
 In such a situation, the British authorities looked for "warrior castes" who were either hunters, or from a peasant culture with a history of fighting
 anya jatiyon ko unki aaraam pasand jivan style yaa rajdrohi hone ke karno se "yoddha jati" nahi mana gaya
 The theory of "warrior caste" was based on the belief that to become a suitable soldier some hereditary qualities are required and apart from some special castes of India, the qualities of being a warrior are not found in other castes
 british senanayake va vidwaan leftinent general sar magamun ne apane uddharanon nen likhaa he ki " british sena me kaam karnaa adharm or sharmnaak samajha jaataa tha atah aisa kadam jaruri tha anyathaa samoochee british sena ko bina myaan se talwaar nikaale yaa bina ek bhi goli chalaaye hi parrast ho jaati
 "therefore, the recruitment of members of the warrior cast into the army became the British policy and remained an integral part of the recruitment regulators of the British Raj
 jefferi greenhat ke anusaar, "yoddha jati ke siddhanth kii rochak visheshta yah thi ki, isame vidwaan va shikshit bharatiyon ko kaayar mana gaya tha tathaa pichde va ashikshit virgon ko bahadur jati ke rup me paribhaashit kiya gaya tha
 " british log ladaaku jatiyon ko bahadur va shaktishaalee maanate the parantu unhe kam medhaavi va badi sainik tukadiyon ke netratv aadi ke ayogy samajha jaataa tha
 They were also considered to be politically subordinate and soft towards officials
 in kaarnon se ladaaku jaati ke siddhanth ko sainya adhikariyon kii bhartee se pruthak rakhaa gaya va bhartee saamaajik str tathaa british raaj ke prati bafadaari par aadhaarit hoti thi
 Sources uniquely call it the "pseudo-ethics structure" propagated by Frederick Sleigh Roberts after which there was a significant reduction in the number of soldiers during World War II and the British government was recruited into the army of non-combatant forces
 Was forced to is siddhanth ke vighatan par winston churchill ne yudrah ke samay bhartiya commander in cheef ko likhaa ki unhe adhik se adhik ladaaku jatiyon par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Critics of this theory are of the opinion that the revolution of 1857 was the reason for the British rule to strengthen the belief in this theory
 kranti me sipaahi mangal pandey ke netratv me bengal netive infentary ne british hukumat ke viruddh baghawat kar di thi

 Since then, these people have been given priority in the recruitment of fighters and the recruitment of rebellious upper classes supporting revolutionaries has been banned

 The British government declared certain caste groups of the Indian subcontinent to be "fighting castes" which were formerly officially classified as "peasant castes" under the "punjab Land Acquisition Act 1925"
 prashasan ne inhe soochivaddh karte samay donon shabdon ko samanaarthi mana
 The following castes were listed in the category of combatants: anya jan samudaay jo bhinn bhinn samay par yoddha jati me jode jate rahe- Despite not being in vogue, Pakistan is said to have relied on the "warrior caste doctrine", especially before the 1965 indo-pak war, thinking that it would easily defeat India
 is siddhanth ke balboote par yah bhi kaha gaya ki ek paak sainik chaar se das hindu yaa bhartiya sainikon ke baraabar he, atah bahusankhyak shatru sena ko bhi jeeta ja sakegaa
 The Bengalis of East Pakistan also accused the army that in view of this principle, they are considered inferior warriors of Punjabi or Pashtuns despite being a resident of East Pakistan
 pakistani lekhak hasan asakaari rizvi ke anusaar pakistani sena me bengaaliyon kii kam bhartee hone kaa kaaran yah tha ki pashchim pakistani "yoddha jati siddhanth" ke mad se ubar nahi sake the
 The Pakistani Saini writer also believes that the partially defective "fighter caste" policy was also responsible for the 1971 defeat, which led to the assumption that the Indian Army would be defeated
 lekhak stephen pi kohen maanate hai ki pakistan ke sthaneey maahaul ke asar se yoddha jati niti ko sachai se bhi upar manyata dekar suraksha sambandhi anya pahaluo ko andekha kiya gaya
 After this, this policy is rarely considered in Pakistan

 On the Samadhi Samvat of Shri Baba Ramdev ji, 1442, Ramdev greeted all the elders by taking the shrimp with his hand, and after offering a letter, everyone worshiped Ramdev with his heart, heart and reverence

 At the fair held every year, it can be easily assessed from the crowd of devotees gathered in the number of lakhs, their importance and respect of the people towards them

 The second grief was that the Bhairava demon had disturbed him 3 miles north of Pokaran, falling in his own kingdom

 Shri Ramdev ji was born on Bhadwa Sudi Pancham on Vikram Samvat 1409 in Undu Kashmeer village of Shiv Tehsil of Barmer district on Monday, which is evidenced by the testimony of Shri Ramdev Ji to Shrimukh, which is written in Samvat Chaturdash Sal Navam Chait Sudi Pancham You come to Shri Mama Bhai Raja Ramdev Chait Sudi v to Ajmal's house which is written by King Ajmal himself with his own hands on the books of Tuvnar dynasty
 Or went which is attested and is also attested in twenty four proofs by Sri Ramdev, written by Gokuldas Aman Ghatoda santaan hi mata-pita ke jivan kaa sukh he
 King Ajmal ji used to do charity for the attainment of his son, saints would give food to saints, offer sacrifices, and worship Dwarkanath regularly
 is prakaar raja ajmal ji bhairav rakshas ko maarane kaa upaay sochate hue dwarka ji pahunche
 Where Ajmal ji had visions of God, seeing the tears in the eyes of the king and wiping tears from his father in the Lord, he said, o Bhaktaraj, don't cry, i know all your sorrows
 main teri bhakthi dekhakar bahut prasann hoon, maango kya chaiye tumhen main teri har ichchhaayein purna karunga
 Pleased with the infinite grace of God, Lord said if you are happy with my devotion, i want a son like you, that is, you have to come to my house as a son and kill the demon and establish religion
 tab bhagwaan dwarkanath ne kaha- he bhakt! jaao main tumhe vachan detaa hoon ki pehle tere putr viramdev hoga tab ajmal ji bole he bhagwaan ek putr kaa kya chota or kya bada to bhagwaan ne kaha- doosraa main swayan aapke ghar aaunga
 Ajmal ji said, o Lord, when you come to my house, what will we know that God has come to visit me, then Dwarkanath said that the night i come home, all the temples in your state will ring the bells in it, palace Whatever water i have in it will turn into milk and Kumkum's feet will be seen from the main gate to the place of birth, i will also hear my Akashvani and i will become famous by the name of Avatar

 shri ramdev ji kaa janm sanwat 1409 main bhadrapada maas kii dooj ko raja ajmal ji ke ghar hua
 At that time, bells started ringing in all the temples, the whole city shone with bright light
 mahal main jitna bhi pani tha vah doodh main badal gaya, mahal ke mukhya dwaar se lekar paalane tak kumkum ke pairon ke padchinh ban gaye, mahal ke mandir main rakhaa sankh swat: baj uthaa
 At the same time, King Ajmal Ji remembered the words given by Lord Dwarkanath and once again said the words of Dwarkanath
 is prakaar ne dwarkanath ne raja ajmal ji ke ghar avatar liya
 Mother lust in Bal Leela bhagwaan nen janm lekar apni bal lila shuru kii
 One day Lord Ramdev and Viramdev were playing on their mother's lap, Mata Maenade was looking at the form of those two boys
 praat:kaal kaa manohari drishy or bhi sundarata badha rahaa tha
 On the other hand, the maid brought out the milk of the cow and while giving utensils in the hands of Mata Maenade, the sportsmanship of these children was roasted
 mata baalkon ko doodh pilaane ke liye doodh ko chuulhe par chadhaane ke liye jaati he
 As soon as the mother puts milk in the vessel, she offers it to the stove
 udhar ramdev ji apni mata ko chamatkaar dikhaane ke liye viramdev ji ke gaal par chumati bharte hai isse viramdev ko krodh aa jaataa he tathaa viramdev badale kii bhaavana se ramdev ji ko dhakka maar dete hai
 Due to which Ramdev ji falls and starts crying
 ramdev ji ke rone kii aawaaj sunakar mata manade doodh ko chulhe par hi chhodkar aati he or ramdev ji ko god main lekar baith jaati he
 On the other hand, the milk starts to fall due to heating, Mata Maenade sees the milk falling as she wants to bring Ramdevji down from the dock, Ramdevji puts his hand towards the milk and with his god power, puts that pot down from the stove
 yah chamatkaar dekhakar mata manade va vahiin baithe ajmal ji va daasi sabhi dwarkanath kii jai jayakaar karte hai
 Once the child Ramdev insisted on the blooming horse, King Ajmal took him to the blossom and asked him to make the toy
 raja ajmal ne chandan or makhmali kapadey kaa ghoda banane ko kaha
 After seeing all this, the bloomer came in a greed and he kept a lot of clothes for his wife and used only a few of them
 jab balak ramdev ghode par baithe to ghoda unhen lekar akaash main chalaa gaya
 The king was angry at the bloomer and ordered him to be put in jail
 kuch samay pashchaat, balak ramdev waapas ghode ke saath aaye
 The bloomer pleaded with Ramdev to accept his mistake and escape
 baba ramdev ne dayaa dikhaate hue use maaf kiya
 Even now, the clothes horse is considered to be a special offering of Baba Ramdev
 sanwat 1425 main ramdev ji maharaj ne pokaran se 12 ki0me0 uttar disha main ek gaanv kii sthapana kii jiskaa naam runicha rakhaa
 People came and started settling in Runicha
 runicha gaanv bada sundar or romantic ban gaya
 Lord Ramdev used to understand his religion only in the service of the guests
 andhe, lule-langade, kodhi va dukhiyon ko hameshaa hriday se lagaakar rakhte the
 At one time Ramdev ji sat in the court and resolved to throw the flag of private religion by throwing the untouched, untouched root from the root, then in the same court a Seth Bohitaraja sat there singing the praises of Prabhu in the court, then Lord Ramdev Ji called him and Seth you go to the state and bring Maya
 prabhu ke vachan sunakar bohitaraaj ghabaraane laga to bhagwaan ramdev ji bole he bhakt jab bhi tere par sankat aave tab main tere har sankat main madad karuunga
 Then Seth left from Runicha and reached the state and earned a lot of money by the grace of Prabhu
 ek varsh main seth hero kaa bahut bada johari ban gaya
 After some time, Seth remembered his children and started preparing to come to his village Runicha
 sethji ne sochaa runicha jaaunga to ramdevji puuchhenge ki mere liye pradesh se kya laaye tab seth ji ne prabhu ke liye hiron kaa haar kharida or naukaron ko aadesh diya ki saare hira panna jevaraat sab kuch naav main bhar do, main apane desh jaaunga or seth sara saamaan lekar ravaanaa hua
 Seth ji thought that this necklace is very valuable, what Lord Ramdev ji will do to this necklace, he got greed and started thinking that what Runicha is a small village, what will i do by staying there, live in a big city and build a big palace
 
 itane main hi samudr main jor kaa tufaan aane laga, naav chalaane vaala bolaa seth ji tufaan bahut bhayankar he naav kaa paradaa bhi fat gaya he
 Now the boat cannot move, the boat will sink
 yah maaya aapke kis kaam kii ham donon marenge
 Seth Bohitaraj also lost patience
 anek devi devataaon ko yaad karne laga lekin sab bekaar, kisi bhi devtaa ne uski madad nahin kii tab sethji ko shri ramdev ji kaa vachan kaa dhyaan aayaa or seth prabhu ko karuna bhari aawaaj se pukaarane laga
 Oh God, i have made a mistake that forgive me
 is prakaar sethji dariyaa main bhagwaan shri ramdev ji ko pukaar rahe the
 On the other hand, Lord Shri Ramdev was sitting in Runicha with his brother Viramdev ji and he heard the call of Bohitaraja
 bhagwaan ramdev ji ne apni bhujaa pasaari or bohitaraaj seth kii jo naav dub rahi thi usko kinare le liya
 This work was done so quickly that even Bhai Veeram Dev sitting nearby did not even know
 ramdev ji ke haath samudr ke pani se bhig gaye the
 Bohitraj Seth wondered how the boat suddenly hit the shore
 itane bhayankar tufaan seth se bachakar seth ke khushi kii seemaa nahin rahi
 The sailor also wondered how the boat got out of the storm so soon, it all happened by the grace of some deity
 seth bohitaraaj ne kaha ki jisaki raksha karne vaale bhagwaan shri ramdev ji he uskaa koi bal baankaa nahin kar saktaa
 Then the sailors also considered Shri Ramdev ji as their favorite god
 gaanv pahunchakar seth ne sari baat gaanv vaalan ko bataayi
 Seth went to the court and met Shri Ramdev ji and said that i had forgotten you after seeing Maya, i was tempted
 mujhe kshamaa karen or aadesh karen ki main is maaya ko kahan kharch karuun
 Then Shri Ramdev Ji said that you carve a stepwell in Runicha and the water of that stepwell will be sweet and people will call it as Parcha Bavdi and its water will be as holy as the Ganges
 is prakaar ramdeora main aaj bhi yah parchaa baavdi bani huyi he
 Due to miracle, people started coming from village to village
 yah baat maulaviyon or piron ko bhi pataa chali
 Lord Shri Ramdev used to go door to door and preach to the people that there is nothing high and low, every caste should get equal rights
 piron ne shri ramdev ji ko parakhane kaa vichaar kiya ki apane se bade pir jo makka main rahete hai unako khabar di ki hinduon main ek mahaan pir paidaa hue hai jo mare hue praani ko jinda kar dete hai, andhe ko aankhe dete hai, atithiyon kii seva karnaa hi apana dharm samajhate hai, unki pariksha lee jaae
 When this news reached Mecca, five Pirs left Mecca
 kuch dinon main ve pir runicha kii ore pahunche
 The five peers asked Lord Ramdev ji, o brother, how far is Ranicha from here, then Lord Ramdevji said that this village which is visible in front is the same Runicha, can i ask the reason for your visit? Then one of those five Pirs said that we have to meet Ramdev Ji here
 tab prabhu bole he piraji main hi ramdev hoon aapke samaane khadaa hoon kahiye mere yogya kya seva he
 Hearing the words of Shri Ramdev ji, the five peers accompanied the Lord
 ramdevji ne paanchon piron kaa bahut seva satkar kiya
 Prabhu came to the palace with all the five peers, there were cushions, pillows and bedspreads and Piraji used to sit on the cushions but Shri Ramdev sat on the bed and said, o Pirji, you are our guest, you have come to our house by eating with us
 To visit itnaa sunakar piron ne kaha ki he ramdev bhojan karne vaale katore ham makka main hi bhuulakar aa gaye hai
 We eat food in the same bowl and the other vessel is forbidden
 aapako bhojan karana he to wo hi katoraa jo ham makka main bhuulakar aaye hai mangava dijiye to ham bhojan kar sakate hai varanaa ham bhojan nahin karenge
 Then Ramdev Ji said, o Pir ji, if it is so, i will ask for your bowls
 aisa kahkar bhagwaan ramdev ji ne apana haath lambaa kiya or ek hi pal main paanchon katore piron ke saamne rakh diye or kaha pir ji ab aap is katore ko pahchaan lo or bhojan karo
 When the pirs saw the five bowls of corn, the five peers believed in the greatness of Shri Ramdev ji and were very impressed by his thoughts and conduct and started saying, "we are Pir but you are great Pir
" aaj se aapako duniya ramapir ke naam se jaanegi
 In this way the Pirs dined and Sri Ramdevji got the title of Pir and was called Ramsapir, Ramapir
 baba ramdev ji ne sanwat 1425 main runicha basaakar apane mata pita kii seva main jute gaye idhar ramdev ji kii mata manade ek din apane pati raja ajmal ji se kehane lagi ki apana rajkumaar bada ho gaya he ab isaki sagaai kar dijiye taaki ham bhi putravadhu dekh saken
 When Baba Ramdev ji was born, at that time, he came by promising Rukmini that i will marry you
 sanwat 1426 main amar kot ke thakur dal ji sodha kii putree naitalde ke saath shri ramdev ji kaa vivaah hua
 It is believed that Baba Ramdev took a living samadhi on Bhadrapad Shukla Dashami
 sanwat 1442 ko ramdev ji ne apane haath se shriphal lekar sab bade budhon ko pranaam kiya tathaa sabane patr pushp chadhaakar ramdev ji kaa hardik tan man va shraddha se antim pujan kiya
 Ramdev stood in the Samadhi and gave his last sermon to everyone and said that every month the Shukla Paksha of Duj should be worshiped, worshiped by worshiping hymns and celebrating the night
 prativarsh mere janmotsav ke upalaksh main tathaa antardhyaan samadhi hone kii smriti main mere samadhi str par mela lagegaa
 Don't keep confusion and discrimination in my samadhi poojan
 main sadaiv apane bhakton ke saath rahungaa
 In this way Shri Ramdev Ji Maharaj took samadhi
