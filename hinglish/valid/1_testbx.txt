 pdf Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha termed the decision to repeal Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and divide the state into two parts
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne ye faisla desh ke baaki hisson main hone ja rahe chunaavon main jeetne ke liye liya he
 On the question of how long will the deployment of heavy military force in the state, he said that this situation is not going to be resolved in a day or two
 aise main sainik vahaan kaaphi samay tak rah sakate hai
 He raised the question that if there is so much benefit from this decision, then what was the need to arrest the leaders and deploy such a large number of army personnel? Yashwant Sinha said that normal situation has arisen in Jammu and Kashmir, it will take a long time to become normal
 yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki jammu kashmir ke saath sarkaar vyavhaar anuchit he
 Yashwant Sinha said that this decision of the government would not be welcomed in the Valley of Kashmir
 sarkaar ko is baat kaa ehsaas he isliye hi vahaan itani badi sankhya main suraksha balon kii tainaati kii gai he
 Referring to the support of Arvind Kejriwal, he said that i am surprised that Kejriwal himself had been fighting for this for a long time
 lekin aaj unhone jammu kashmir ko centre shasit pradesh bananeka samarthan kar diya
 He said that by showing the picture of drums in the country, it is cheered but people do not know that these drums are not playing in the valley, laddus are not being distributed there
 main yah sochakar kaanp jaataa hum ki tab kya hoga, jab sarkaar sthiti par niyantran ke liye koi kadam uthaaegi
 Due to this special status, Article 356 of the Constitution does not apply to the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 - is kaaran raashtrapati ke paas rajya ke samvidhan ko barkhaast karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 - Citizens of Jammu and Kashmir have dual citizenship (india and Kashmir)
 - bharat kii sansad jammu-kashmir ke sambandh main atyant simit kshetra main kanoon bana sakati he
 - The national flag of Jammu and Kashmir is different
 vahaan ke nagarikon dwaara bharat ke rashtriya dhvaj kaa sammaan karnaa anivaary nahin he
 - Under this, the Indian citizen has the right to purchase land anywhere in India except in the states having special rights
 yani bharat ke duusare rajyon ke log jammu-kashmir main jameen nahin kharid sakate
 - Article 360 of the Constitution of India under which there is a provision for imposing financial emergency in the country also does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir
 - jammu-kashmir kii vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal 6 varshon kaa hota he jabaki bharat ke anya rajyon kii vidhansabhaon kaa kaarykaal 5 varsh kaa hota he
 - The orders of the Supreme Court of India are not valid inside Jammu and Kashmir
 - jammu-kashmir kii koi mahila agar bharat ke kisi anya rajya ke vyakti se vivaah kar le to us mahila kii naagarikta samaapt ho jaaegi
 Conversely, if he marries a person from Pakistan, he too will get citizenship of Jammu and Kashmir
 - dhara 370 kii vajah se kashmir main artiai or sieji (CAG) jaise kanoon lagu nahin hote hai
 - Sharia law is applicable to women in Kashmir
 - kashmir main panchayat ko adhikaar praapt nahin he
 Due to Article 370, Pakistanis living in Kashmir also get Indian citizenship

 He said that Sardar Patel had dreamed of Sardar Sarovar Dam when the country was not free at 71 years, this is the hallmark of his vision

" or koi doosraa jor de rahaa he ki ham ise gaayen kyonki unka yah maananaa he ki hamen nicha dikhaane kaa yahi ekmaatr tarika he
 Regarding advice to members of his community on this issue, Khurshid said, "I would ask them to sing it

 He said that while they can sing Vande Mataram with national pride, others should also sing it with the same spirit

 somvaar ko dilli main sirf 2,4,6,8,0 number vaali gaadiyaan daudengeeod-evan niyam todane par 4000 rupee kaa chaalaan kategadilli main pradooshan kii khatarnaak sthiti se nipatane ke liye aaj se od-evan yojana shuru ho gai
 Today is the first day of odd-even
 4 taarikh hone kii vajah se somvaar ko dilli kii sadakon par sirf 2,4,6,8,0 vaali gaadiyaan daudengi
 There is a lot of confusion among the drivers regarding aud-even
 od-evan ke niyam ke tahat kya praavdhaan hai, ham use bataa rahe hai
 1- Whether paying a fine of Rs 4000, will be able to run all day, the vehicle will be returned or confiscated with fine or fine? Answer - Breaking of the odd-even rule applicable under the new Motor Vehicle Act, this time from November 4 to 15 But a challan of Rs 4000 will have to be given
 yah jaananaa jaruri he kiod-evananium todane par ek baar chaalaan kaate jane ke baad bhi agar dobaaraa us vaahan ko niyam todate paaya gaya, to phir se jurmaana dena hoga
 The vehicle will not be seized and the car will be returned with a fine
 ye saaf he ki ek baar niyam todane par, chaalaan cat jane ke baad vaahan ko sadak par nahin chalaa sakenge
 You can park your vehicle in the nearest parking lot
 2-kin immergency gadiyon ko chhot he?jawaab-immergency vaahanon main is baar bhiembulance, fire brigade, jail ke kaidiyon ke vaahan, or shavvaahan ko od-evan ke dauraan chhot milegi
 Apart from this, vehicles of Delhi Police have also been kept out of the ambit of aud-even
 saath hi aise log jo apane vaahan main kisi marij ko aspataal le ja rahe hon, unhen bharose ke aadhaar par hi immergency chhot di jaaegi
 3- Children wearing school uniform but male driver, if the vehicle is violating the aud-even? Answer- If you aud day (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,13, 15, 17, 19, 21 , 23, 25, 27, 29 and 31) carrying a child wearing a school dress in a vehicle of even number (2,4,6,8,0), you will still be exempted from the rule
 agar gaadi ke andar skool kii dress pahane hue baccha baitha he, to chaalak chaahe mahila ho yaa purush, use od-evan niyam se chhot milegi
 However, Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot says that the school timings are from 7 am to 7:30 am
 aise main us vaahan ko 8 baje se pehle waapas aana hoga, kyonki od-evan niyam subah 8 baje ke baad lagu hoga
 4- How will people from outside or other states know whether there is an aud or even today? Answer - Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced that the aud-even rule will be applicable to vehicles coming from other states in Delhi
 aise main desh kii rajdhani main anya rajyon ke vaahanon ko od-evan ke bare main jaagruk karne ke liye sarkaar vigyaapan kii madad legi
 Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot told 'aaj Tak' that this time due to the new Motor Vehicle Act, the penalty will be higher
 aise main jitne bhi rajya hai vahaan ke akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar dilli main od-evan niyam kii jaanakri di jaaegi
 There will also be huge hoardings about aud-evens at entry-point points or borders in Delhi from other states
 5- agar kisi ko jaananaa ho ki aaj od he yaa evan to kaise janenge (kya-kya tareeke hai)jawaab-agar aapaki gaadi kii number plate kaa aakhri number od (1,3,5,7,9) he, to aap 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 or 31 taarikh ko hi gaadi chalaa sakate hai
 Similarly, if the last number of your car is even (2,4,6,8,0), then you will get 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,18, 20, 22, 24, 26 of the month
 , 28, 30 can only drive the car out
 aise main ghar se nikalne se pehle taarikh or gaadi kii plate kaa aakhri number jarur dekh len
 6- How to know the number odd or even on the basis of train number? Answer-odd-even means that the last number of your car's number plate is even or odd
 is formule main dilli kii sadakon par ek din od or uske agle din evan number kii gaadiyaan chalaane kaa niyam hota he
 In the language of mathematics, 1,3,5,7 and 9 are called odd numbers
 isi tarah 2,4,6,8 or 0 ko evan number kaha jaataa he
 The aud-even rule will be applicable from 4 November to 15 November 2019 in Delhi
 iskaa arth he ki november 2019 kii 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 taarikh ko evan number ke vaahan sadakon par chalenge
 Whereas, on the 5th, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 of November 2019, vehicles of Odd number will be allowed to ply on the roads

 bhay kaa maahaul he yah bolne se sabit hota he yaa nahin bolne se sabit hota he
 Because after Rahul Bajaj spoke, it was said that if there was an atmosphere of fear, you would not be able to speak
 chunki aap bol sake isliye bhay kaa maahaul nahin he
 The biggest proof that you are able to speak is that Amit Shah is responding in detail
 isse sabit hota he ki bhay kaa maahaul nahin he
 81-year-old Rahul Bajaj not only spoke of the atmosphere of fear but also drew the line of his heritage from where he comes
 rahul bajaj ne sirf bhay ke maahaul kii baat nahin kii balki wo sawaal kar diya jo aaj ke patrkaar amit shah se shaayad hi kar pate
 Asked to call Gandhi's killer a patriot, Sadhvi questioned Pragya's ticket
 saamne amit shah baithe the jinhone kaha tha ki sadhvi pragna ko tikat dena satyagrah he
 Rahul Bajaj was questioned, whose grandfather Jamana Lal Bajaj had established the Satyagraha Ashram in Wardha
 is bayaan ko lekar yah bhi reporting ho rahi he ki kis kis ne ise nahin chapa, chapa to bheetar ke pannon main chapa yaa gol hi kar diya
 What Rahul Bajaj said for the industry also becomes a test for the media
 rahul bajaj kii baat isliye bhi or badi ho gai ki ve grahamantri amit shah ke saamne baat kar rahe the
 This also caused Amit Shah to relax and he replied in detail and said that if there is an atmosphere of fear, then we will try to remove the atmosphere of this fear
 aapke sawaal ke baad mujhe nahin lagata ki kisi ko dar he
 Bajaj saheb has been made a breeze
 sadhvi pragna kaa bayaan aate hi bijepi ke varisht netaaon ne aalochana kii
 He apologized in Parliament
 unki baat ko lekar kanfusion he to udham singh or godse kii baat kar rahi thim magar bijepi aise bayaan ko saport nahin karti
 But still the BJP or the government cannot support any such statement
 ham ghor ninda karte hai
 There is no hesitation in saying this
 jahaan tak liching kaa sawaal he, main itnaa hi kah saktaa hum ki liching pehle bhi hota tha, aaj bhi hota he
 Probably less than before
 yah bhi thik nahin he ki kisi kaa kanviction nahin hua he
 Many cases of litching were also eliminated
 sazaa bhi hui he magar media main chhapati nahin he
 'it is a good thing that Amit Shah responded properly but his answer led to different questions
 jaise rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro ne liching kaa data hi nahin chapa, to phir amit shah kahaan se kah rahe hai ki linching kam ho gai he
 While the count of private websites and institutions says that litching has increased
 quint website par liching kii ghatana trek kii jaati he
 There have been 113 deaths since 2015
 vaise kya amit shah puri tarah se galat bol rahe the ki liching ke maamle main sazaa hui he
 The Print reported in its October 9 report that 89 people have been convicted in the lynching case in Jharkhand
 yah bhi to he ki liching ke aaropee jab zamaanat par baahar aae to unki hi pehali sarkaar ke mantri jayant sinha maala pahana rahe the

 sawaalon ke ghere main rahe sibiai ke do top afasar aapas main sirfutowwal kar rahe hai
 The battle between CBI Director Alok Verma and number two Rakesh Asthana has come to the fore
 donon ek-duusare par bhrashtachar ke aaropon kaa keechad oochaal rahe hai or kirakiri sibiai kii ho rahi he
 The country's largest investigative agency is thrashing through
 bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii daldal mencibiaiki saakh dub rahi he
 Embarrassing head fights between the two biggest officers
 sibiai hi sibiai daftar main chaape maar rahi he
 Alok Verma is the director of CBI and Rakesh Asthana is the special director
 donon top afasaron ke bich ghamaasan jari he
 The two are engaged in taking off each other's uniforms
 pehali baar somvaar ko sibiai ne apane hi daftar main ek afasar ke chembar main chapa maaraa
 Also arrested him
 ye afasar hai sibiai ke dspi devendra kumaar
 Raiding Devendra's home and office, the CBI has recovered eight mobile phones, a laptop and some documents
 aaj dilli ke patiala house court main unki peshi hogi
 But Devendra Kumar is just a link to this game
 asli nishane par to sibiai ke special diarector rakesh asthana hai
 The FIR against 1984-batch Gujarat cadre IPS Rakesh Asthana has been registered in the case of businessman Moin Qureshi on a complaint by Hyderabad-based businessman Satish Sana
 kaarobaari sanaa kaa aarope he ki sibiai jaanch se bachane ke liye usnjasthanako 3 karod rupee ghoose die
 Apart from Asthana, cbi's DSP Devendra Kumar, investor banker Manoj Prasad and his brother Somesh Prasad are also named in the FIR

 It is alleged that Manoj had asked for five crores to be given to the CBI officer
 15 oktober ko rakesh asthana ke khilaaf exiaar darj hui
 Three days later, Asthana wrote a letter to the Cabinet Secretary and the Central Vigilance Commissioner, fearing that CBI chief Alok Verma wanted to implicate him in a fake case
 isse pehle asthana verma par do karod rishwat lene kaa aarope jad chuke hai
 The feud between Alok Verma and Rakesh Asthana is bringing the country's highest investigating agency into disarray
 sawaal uth rahaa he ki jis agency par bhrashtachar ke aarope lag rahe hon wo saaf-suthri jaanch kaise karegi
 Today is the holy festival of Makar Sankranti and on this occasion devotees have been engaged in different parts of the country for bathing on the banks of the Ganges since morning

 11 companies of PAC, 3 companies of Rapid Action Force, three companies of Water Police, bomb disposal squad and antimines team have also been installed in the fair
 sena ko bhi alert par rakhaa gaya he
 Overall, the entire fair area has been converted into a cantonment
 suraksha ke lihaaj se 10 thane or 32 police chowkiya bhi banaai gai hai
 Five temporary bridges have also been built to prevent a stampede-like event at the fair
 lekin aisa pehali baar hua he jab makar sankranti kii tithi ko lekar panditon main alag-alag raay he
 Some astrologers claim that the festival of Makar Sankranti should be celebrated on January 15 instead of 14 because this time the Sun is entering Capricorn at midnight

 Within a week, three BSF personnel have been killed so far, while eight Pakistani Rangers jawans have been killed and one jawan has been injured in BSF retaliation
 international border kii baat karen to kathua, hiranagar, ares pura or arniya sector main zyada paak kii ore se golabari ho rahi he
 Small arms, machine guns, up to 82 mm mortars are being used by Pakistan
 badi baat yah he ki yahaan ibi par gaanv based hue hai
 People do farming
 firing ke dar se log ghar-baar chhod kar surakshit jagahon par ja rahe hai
 More than 20 people have been injured within a week
 vahiin, elosi par jammu kaa palanwaala, sunderbani, naushera, rajouri, biji, mesur, krishna ghati or poonch tak main paak kii ore se lagaataar yudhviram kaa ulanghan kiya ja rahaa he
 But a ceasefire has been breached on the loc from Mendhar to Jammu for a week, especially in Palanwala, Nowshera, Rajouri and Mendhar sectors
 yahaan bhi paak kii ore se chote hathiyaar, mashinagan, 82 mem or 120 mem mortar tak istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 a soldier was also killed 10 days ago in Pak firing in Rajouri
 vahiin, do din pehle naushera main sena kii firing main teen paak javaanon ke maare jane kii khabar bhi he
 The comments sargical strike ke baad ab tak paak kii ore se 50 dfa se adhik yudhviram kaa ulanghan kiya ja chukaa he
 It is believed that the motive behind the ceasefire violation in this entire area is to avenge the surgical strike
 wo sidhe to kuch kar nahin sakate hai, lekin yudhviram ulanghan kii aad main golabari kar nuksaan to pahunchaa hi sakate hai
 At the same time, they also try to infiltrate the terrorists if they get a chance under the cover of shelling
 bataa den ki sena or biguef ko saaf nirdesh hai ki paak kii har harakat kaa munhtod jawaab dena he, yani ek fire ho to aap do fire kholen
 But the problem here is that the Pakistani soldiers hide secretly from their bunker or post while the BSF and Army soldiers respond by firing and also do patrolling because the terrorists will not come from Pakistan
 international border yani ibi par 2014 ke baad se firing lagbhag band thi, lekin achaanak 19-20 kii raat se paak kii ore se golabari kii shuruyaat hoti he jo ab tak jari he
 There has been continuous firing on the IB since then
 ek hafte ke bheetar ab tak biguef ke teen jawan shahid ho gaye hai, vahiin biguef kii javaabi karrwai main aath paak rangers ke jawan maare gaye hai or ek jawan ghayal hua he
 Talking about the international border, there is more Pakistan firing in Kathua, Hiranagar, RS Pura and Arnia sectors
 paak kii ore se chote hathiyaar, mashinagan, 82 mem mortar tak istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 The great thing is that villages are inhabited here on the IB
 log kheti baadi karte hai
 Fear of firing, people leave home and go to safe places
 ek hafte ke bheetar 20 se zyada log ghayal ho gaye hai
 At the same time, Pakistan is continuously violating the ceasefire on loc in Palanwala, Sundarbani, Nowshera, Rajouri, BG, Medhar, Krishna Valley and Takh Tak
 lekin idhar ek hafte se mendhar se jammu tak elosi par yudhviram kaa ulanghan ho rahaa he khaskar zyaadaatar palanwaala, naushera, rajouri or mendhar sector tak
 Here too, small arms, machine guns, 82 mm and 120 mm mortars are being used by Pakistan
 rajouri main paak firing main 10 din pehle ek jawan kii maut bhi hui thi
 At the same time, there are also reports of three Pak soldiers killed in the army firing in Nowshera two days ago
 tippaniyan More than 50 ceasefire violations have been violated by Pakistan since the surgical strike
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki is puure ilaake main yaddhviram ulanghan ke peeche makasad sargical strike kaa badla lenaa makasad he
 They cannot do anything directly, but they can do damage by firing under the guise of ceasefire violation
 saath hi unki koshish yah bhi he ki golabari kii aad main mauka mili to aatankiyon kii ghuspaith kara ein
 Explain that there are clear instructions to the Army and BSF that you have to give a befitting reply to every action of Pakistan, that is, if there is one fire, then you open two fires
 lekin yahaan dikkat ye bhi he ki pakistani jawan apane bunker yaa post se chhipakar fire karte hai jabaki biguef or sena ke jawan firing se jawaab bhi dete hai or petroling bhi karte hai kyonki aatanki to pakistan se aaegein yahaan se jaaenge nahin

 urdu shaayari ko aksar romani ateet ko yaad karne kaa jariya mana jaataa he
 But how popular is it today? There are many possible answers to this question
 ek tarika yah he ki twitor par kuch lokapriy shaayaron kii folowing ke aankadon par najar daali jaae
 Rahat Indori has over 4,00,000 followers
 yah indore ke us purv professor or painter ke liye kam nahin jo virtual duniya se zyada vabsta nahin
 Today there is no dearth of those who call him the most popular poet of Urdu
 mushaairon ke aayojakon ke liye ve sabhagaaron ke naujavaanon se khachaakhach bhare rahane kii guarantee hai, hindustan hi nahin, duniya bhar main
 His books sell well, as does Satyanand Nirupam Tasdek, the editor of Rajkamal Prakashan, the largest publisher in Hindi
 devanagari jabaan main unki do kitaaben yahaan se chhapi hai
 He has also written popular songs in hit films, won many awards and garnered accolades across the world
 raahat indori kii kamyaabi kii kahani yah he ki unhone teenon kshetron main apni maujuudagi kaa ehsaas karavaaya he
 In his dramatic style, he has changed the mood of Mushayars radically, like a rock star full of sizzling and hanging
 unke aalochak manch par shaayari sunaate vakt unke latakon-jhatkon or harkaton kii taraf ishaara karte hai, jo ve apni lokapriyata par mohar lagavane ke makasad se logon kii vaahvahee hasil karne ke liye karte hai; par log kehete hai naa ki lokapriyata mahanata kaa paimaana nahin
 In the opinion of Prakash Purohit, a Hindi editor from Indore, there are those who believe that the poetry he wrote has more depth than poetry written in Mushayars
 unke sabase najdiki doston or pramotaron main hindi kavi kumaar vishwaas bhi hai, jo unase thik 20 saal chote hai
 He has seen Indauri grow in three stages in the last 25 years — first Urdu scholar; Other more or less popular but mushy poets are poets who read poetry in bad style; And the third "shire-e-azam" of international repute
 unki shoharat satta pratishthan ke prati nishchit berukhi se bani he, keval satta pratishthan nahin balki urdu kaa saahitiyik pratishthan bhi
 Vishwas started as a stranger in the world of Hindi poetry and carved her own path and made a place in the hearts of young listeners
 twitor par unke 54 lakh folover hai
 In Indore, he found an experienced star performer and friend
 vishwaas ke aagrah par hi unke bete faisal ne pita kii online maujuudagi kii saar-sambhaal shuru kii or unka brands taiyaar kiya
 His second son Sutlej put his journalism at stake to take care of the aged father's health and accompany him to Mushayars across the country
 vishwaas indori ko dilachasp or puralutf humsafar qaraar dete hai, jinke paas puraane saahitiyik kirdaaron kii karstaniyon ke beshumaar kisse hai
 Indouri is often compared to Dushyant Kumar, who died in 1975 at the age of 42
 dushyant ko satta pratishthan ne sweekaar nahin kiya, magar apane krantikari vichaaron kii vajah se ve khaase lokapriy hai
 Similarly, Indori is called John Eliya of Hindustan, an adventurous Pakistani poet
 nirupam indori ko bahaduree kii durlabh misaal qaraar dete hai jo 2014 main bhartiya janata party ke satta main aane ke baad beete paanch saal main badalte siyaasi mizaaj kii aalochana karne se jaraa nahin hichake
 Some say that they go much further in criticism and go into the communal enclosure created by the recent religious polarization
 hindutv kii mukhalifat ke liye unhen online trol kiya jaataa he, par unhen jaanane vaale kehete hai ki ve katai dharmik nahin hai, unke sarokaar sampradayik hone ke bajaae saamaajik hai
 Considering the way the controversies have followed them, they have become irritated about talking to reporters
 unke kaam se waakif koi bhi shaks unke ravaiye or unke bheetar khaulate gusse kii baat karata he or yah bhi ki ve kitni aasaani se aakrosh se hatakar romani mizaaj main ja sakate hai
 Vishwas would say that the style of his poem can be distinguished separately
 purohit kehete hai, duusari tamaam baton ko chhod bhi den to ve urdu ko aam logon tak le gaye hai
 Countless youngsters hear their voices in their lions
 noujvaan shrotaaon ko aakarshith karne kii garaj se un par lokapriyatawad, yon ishaaron kaa istemaal karne or naatakeey andaaj main shaayari padhgaye kaa iljaam bhi lagaaya jaataa he
 These risks are well associated with this fun
 apane mushaairon main indori aksar shrotaaon se bade dhyaan se sunne ke liye kehete hai kyonki ''kabhi-kabhi main acha sher bhi pard jaataa hum
 "udayan Vajpayee, author and editor of the literary magazine Samas, says that the Urdu tradition has emphasized questioning itself; classics begin with encounters with themselves before encountering the world
 yah ve indori kii shaayari main dekhnaa chahenge
 Rebel, political, Urdu servant, populist, proclaiming violence with violent images, very sensationalist, revolutionary, reactionary, humanitarian
 
 
 inamen se kise aap asli raahat indori kahenge! The government has set a 500-word limit in the petitions to be filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act for obtaining information
 iske saath hi kanoon ke tahat kendriya soochna ayog main apil daayar karne ke liye nayaa praaroop bhi tay kiya he
 Under the new rule notified on 31 July, the government has made it necessary for the appellants or their authorized representatives to appear before the CIC either themselves or through video conferencing
 naye niyam ke tahat, aavedan ke saath 10 rupee kaa shulk jamaa karnaa hoga or aavedan ke shabdon kii seemaa paanch sau shabdon se adhik nahin honi chahie, isamen mukhya jan sampark adhikari or yachikakarta kaa pataa likhaa hona chahie
 Significantly, there was no limitation of words in the application related to seeking information before this
 niyam main haalanki kaha gaya he ki is aadhaar par aavedan ko radd nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki isamen 500 se adhik shabd hai
 According to the notification issued by the Ministry of Personnel and Training and Public Grievances, the petitioner will have to pay additional postal fee for providing information exceeding Rs 50
 haalanki garibi rekha se neeche guzar basar karne waalon ko koi shulk nahin dena hoga
 In this regard, they have to provide a copy of the certificate issued by the appropriate government
 peedit vyakti kii ore se daayar apil ke saath mukhya jan sampark adhikari ke samaksh pesh kiye gaye aavedan or praapt jawaab kii prati bhi sanlagn kerani hogi
 If any appeal has been made to the first Appellate Authority or any order has been received then these will also have to be attached
 niyam main kaha gaya he ki agar ye sabhi dastavej sanlagn nahin honge tab yaachikkarta ko apil waapas lautaayi ja sakati he
 Even though the other parties are referring to the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) Parivartan rally at Gandhi Maidan in Bihar on Wednesday, the two sons of RJD national president Lalu Prasad are entering politics but both sons of Lalu are Tejashwi and Tej Pratap Party
 The rally is described as the beginning of the battle to overthrow the government of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 patna main apane awaas se raily ke liye prasthaan karne se pehle tej pratap ne kaha ki nitish chachaa ne jab bihar main mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee thi, tab kaha tha ki agle teen maheenon ke dauraan bihar ko paris bana denge
 He could not make Bihar into Paris, but went to Bihar and the abyss
 unhone sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki aaj bihar ke log khaane ko taras rahe hai, bihar kii haalat sabhi morche par jarjar ho gai he
 Like Tej Pratap, this change rally will usher in a change of power in Bihar and a new Bihar will be established
 tej pratap se jab poocha gaya ki kya rajd sarkaar main bihar ko paris banaaya jayega to unhone kaha ki donon bhai bihar ko paris to nahin bana sakate, parantu yuvaaon ke netritv main nae bihar kii sthapana jarur karenge
 Here, Lalu's second son Tejashwi also marched with hundreds of youth towards Gandhi Maidan
 gandhi maidan jane ke kram main unhone kaha ki nitish chachaa kii sarkaar main vikaas ke naam par dhong kiya ja rahaa he
 He said that the people of today have grown tired of the present government
 janata vartmaan sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye kritasankalp he tabhi yahaan itane log aae hai
 Tejashwi says that today the image of Biharis is getting tarnished in other states
 aaj bihar ke yuva roji-roti ke liye anya rajyon main palaayan kar rahe hai
 There is no education facility in the state, bureaucracy has increased and hence they are going before the people about the wrong policies of the government
 ullekhneey he ki lalu ke donon putr parivartan raily ko lekar puure rajya kaa daura kar chuke hai or is dauraan unhone logon ko raily main aane kaa nyotaa diya tha
 The reins of power in Greece have now come into the hands of the leftist party 'syriza'
 2009 se aarthik sankat se jujh rahe greece ke liye yah satta parivartan behad ahm mana ja rahaa he
