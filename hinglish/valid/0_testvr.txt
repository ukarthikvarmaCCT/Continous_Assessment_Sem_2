 The English art historian Douglas Cooper describes three stages of cubism in his seminal book, The Cubist Epic
 kupar ke anusaar "praarambhik cubism" tha jab shuruuaat main picasso or baraak ke studio main andolan viksit kiya gaya tha, duusare charan ko "ucch cubism" kaha jaataa he, jis dauraan juaan gris mahatvapurn pratipadak ke rup main ubhare or aakhir main kupar ne "antim cubism" ko kattarpanthi nav-vichaarak kala andolan kaa aakhri charan kaha
 In Cubist painting, objects are broken, analyzed, and re-created separately, rather than from a point of view, representing the artist in a larger context than many other perspectives
 aksar sataha yadrichhik konon par ek duusare ko katate prathit hote hai or gaharaai kii susangat samaj ko khatm kar dete hai
 The flat surface of the background and objects interact and create a shallow ambiguous space, which is one of the special features of Cubism
 angreji kala itihaaskaar, sangrahakartta or da cubist ipak ke lekhak duglas kupar ne paul gogyuin or paul sezen ke bare main kaha he ki "ye donon hi kalakaar cubism ke gathan ke vishesh rup se or 1906 se 1907 ke dauraan picasso ke chitron se prabhavit the"
 kupar kehete hai ki les demoicelis ko aksar galati se pehali cubist chitrakala ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 they tell, kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki cubism kii jadon ko sezen ke baad ke kaamon main do alag pravritiyon main paaya gaya: sabase pehle range hue sataha ko rangon ke chote bahupaksheeya kshetron main todane ke liye, baad main doorabeen drushtikon dwaara di gayi is mishrit drushti par jor dena or doosraa belanon, vritton ke prakritik roopon ke sarleekaran main ruchi ke jariye
 However, this concept was further explored by Cubist after Cézanne, who represented all the surfaces of the objects represented in the same picture, as if all the faces of the objects were visible at the same time
 This new style of illustration revolutionized the way objects were viewed in painting and art
 cubism ke avishkaar main paris ke montmari ke nivaasiyon picasso or baraak kaa sanyukt prayaas shaamil tha
 These artists were the principal inventors of the movement
 baad main spani juaan gris bhi is andolan main sakriy bhagidaar ke rup main jude
 1907 main milane ke baad baraak or picasso ne vishesh rup se cubism ke vikaas par kaam shuru kiya
 Picasso was initially the power and influence that persuaded Barack to break away from Fauvism by 1908
 donon kalakaaron ne 1908 ke aakhir or 1909 ke shuru se ek saath milakar kaam karnaa shuru kiya or 1914 main pratham vishwa yuddh chhidane tak saath kaam kiya
 The movement quickly spread to Paris and throughout Europe
 francisi kala sameekshak louis woxelus ne 1908 main baraak dwaara banaaye gaye ek chitra ko dekhne ke baad pehali baar "cubism" yaa "bijaare cubics" shabd kaa prayog kiya

 kala itihaaskaar ernest gombrich ne cubism ko "aspashtataa kaa safaya karne or tasviir ke, jo ek maanav nirmit nirmaan, ek ranga hua canvas hota he, ke ek paath ko bal dene- ke sarvaadhik moulik prayaas" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 Cubism was adopted by many artists in Montparnasse and encouraged by art trader Daniel Henry Conwiller, it became popular so quickly that a "cubic school" of artists was referred to by critics in 1911
 haalanki, apane ko cubist samajhane vaale anek kalakaar aisi dishaao main chale gaye jo baraak or picasso ke nirdeshon se kaaphi alag thim
 The Putoux group or section was an important branch of the d'or Cubist movement, including Guillaume Apollinaire, Robert Delaunay, Marcel Duchamp with his brothers Raymond duchamp-villon and Jacques Villon, and Fernad Lazar and Francis Picabio

 The Czech artists, realizing the neoclassical importance of Picasso and Barak's Cubism, attempted to extract all branches of artistic creation — particularly painting and its components — for their personal work of architecture

 Analytical Cubism was one of the two major branches of the artistic movement of Cubism and developed between 1908 and 1912
 synthetic cubism ke vipareet vishleshnatmak cubyston ne prakritik roopon kaa "vishleshan" kiya or in roopon ko do aiami chitra patal par buniyadi jyamitiya bhaagon main kam kiya

 vishleshnatmak cubist rang par jor dene ke bajaae prakritik vishwa kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye belan, vrutt or shanku jaise roopon par dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya
 There is a shared use of stylistic similarities in the works by Picasso and Barak during this movement
 pablo picasso or jorejis baraak donon udahaaran ke taur par apane chitron picasso ke maa joli, evam baraak ke da portuguese ke rup main chitra ke baahar kii vaastaviktaa or frem ke andar kii drishy bhashaa par jatil chintan ke bich ek tanaav kii aapurti karne ke liye vaastavik duniya ke liye paryaapt sanket chhodkar pruthakkaran kii ore chale gaye
 Shortly after the death of Paul Cézanne in Paris in 1907 there was a large museum retrospective exhibition of his works
 pradarshnee sezen ko ek mahatvapurn chitrakaar ke rup main sthapit karne main atyadhik prabhaavshaalee rahi jiske vichaar mukhyatah paris ke yuva kalakaaron ke liye vishesh rup se gunjyman rahe
 Both Picasso and Barak drew inspiration for Cubism from Paul Cézanne, who said that to observe and learn, look at nature and behave as if it were formed from basic shapes such as cubes, circles, cylinders, and cones
 picasso mukhya vishleshnatmak cubist the lekin baraak bhi pramukh the, jinhone cubist shabdkosh ko viksit karne main picasso ke saath kaam karne ke liye fovism kaa tyaag kar diya

 While analytical cubism was an analysis of subjects, synthetic cubism is mostly about pushing multiple objects together

 prakaash sanshleshan vah kriya he jisamen paudhe apane hare rang vaale ango jaise pattee, dwaara surya ke prakaash kii upasthiti main vaayu se carbondioxide tathaa bhoomi se jal lekar jatil carbonic khaadya padaarthon jaise carbohydrates kaa nirmaan karte hai tathaa oxygen gas baahar nikaalte hai
 In the process of photosynthesis, simple carbohydrates and later complex carbohydrates are formed by the addition of carbon dioxide and water inside the cells of green leaves of plants in the presence of sunlight
 is prakriya main oxygen evam urja se bharpoor carbohydrate aadi) kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxygen gas baahar nikalati he
 Water, carbon dioxide, sunlight and chlorophyll are called components of photosynthesis
 isamen se jal tathaa carbondioxide ko prakaash sanshleshan kaa kaccha maal kaha jaataa he
 The process of photosynthesis is one of the most important biochemical reactions
 sidhe yaa paroksh rup se duniya ke sabhi sajiv is par ashrith hai
 Animals that transmit light are called autotrophs
 prakaash yahan abhikriya main bhaag nahin letaa he balki is abhikriya ke liye prakaash kii upasthiti aavashyak he
 This chemical reaction involves chemical reactions between 6 molecules of carbon dioxide and 12 molecules of water, resulting in one molecule of glucose, 6 molecules of water and 6 molecules of oxygen
 is kriya main mukhya utpaada glucose hota he tathaa oxigen or jal up padaarth ke rup main mukt hote hai
 The water produced in this reaction is absorbed by the cell and then reoccur in biochemical reactions
 mukt oxigen vaataavaran main chali jaati he
 The source of this free oxygen is water molecules, not carbon dioxide molecules
 abhikriya main surya kii vikiran urja kaa roopaantaran rasinic urja main hota he
 Which accumulate in glucose molecules
 prakaash-sanshleshan main paudhon dwaara prati varsh lagbhag 100 terrawatt kii saurya urja ko rasinic urja ke rup main bhojya padaarth ke anuon main band diya jaataa he
 The magnitude of this energy is 7 times more than the annual energy expenditure of the entire human civilization
 yah urja yahan sthitij urja ke rup main sanchit rahati he
 Hence, the process of photosynthesis is also called energy bonding
 is prakaar prakaash-sanshleshan karne vaale sajiv lagbhag 10,00,00,00,000 ton carbon ko prati varsh jaev-padaarthon main badal dete hai
 It has been known since ancient times that plants get their nutrition through roots
 1772 main stephen heles ne bataaya ki paudhon kii pattiyaan vaayu se bhojan grahan karti hai tathaa is kriya main prakaash kii kuch mahatvapurn kriya he
 Priestley first told in 1772 that if a candle is lit in the air generated during this process, it keeps on burning
 mombatti jalane ke pashchaat utpann vaayu main yadi ab ek jivit chuha rakhaa jaye to vah mar jaataa he
 He again stated in 1775 that the gas released by the plants during the day is oxygen
 iske pashchaat ingine house ne 1779 main bataaya ki hare paudhe surya ke prakaash main co2 grahan karte hai tathaa oxygen nikaalte hai

 Sasur told in 1804 that plants take oxygen only in respiration day and night, but they release oxygen during photosynthesis
 at: oxijan puure din kaam me aati he par carbon daai oksaide se oxijan keval prakaash sanshleshan me hi banati he
 Mother-in-law reported in 1887 that starch is produced in plants by ingesting CO2 and extracting o2 of green plants
 hare paudhon main hone vaali prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya paudhon evam anya jivit praaniyon ke liye ek bahut hi mahatvapurn kriya he
 In this process, plants convert sunlight energy into chemical energy and complex carbon compounds become carbohydrates from simple substances like CO2 water
 in carbohydrates dwaara hi manushya evam jivit praaniyon ko bhojan praapt hota he
 In this way, plants make food for the whole animal world by the process of photosynthesis
 carbohydrates protein evam vitamin aadi ko praapt karne ke liye vibhinn fasalein ugaai jaati hai tathaa in sab padaarthon kaa nirmaan prakaash sanshleshan dwaara hi hota he
 Rubber, plastics, oils, cellulose and many drugs are also produced in photosynthesis in plants
 hare vriksh prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main carbon dioxide ko lete hai or oxigen ko nikaalte hai, is prakaar vaataavaran ko shuddh karte hai
 Oxygen is essential for all animals to breathe
 paryaavaran ke sangrakshan ke liye bhi is kriya kaa bahut mahatv he
 Photosynthesis is also very important for fisheries
 jab prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya dhimi ho jaati he to jal main carbon daai oxide kii maatra bad jaati he
 Its exceeding 5 cc per liter is harmful for fisheries
 prakaash sanshleshan jaev eendhan banane main bhi sahaayak hota he
 Through this, plants also produce biofuels through solar energy
 yah jaev eendhan vibhinn prakriya se guzarate hue vividh urja sroton kaa utpaadan karata he
 For example fodder for animals, instead of which we get cow dung, cooking food through agricultural residues etc
 manushya ke atirikt anya jeev jantuon main bhi prakaash-sanshleshan kaa bahut mahatv he
 Humans synthesize vitamin d in their skin through light
 vitamin di ek vasa main ghulansheel rasayan he, iske sanshleshan main parabangnee kirnon kaa prayog hota he
 Some sea snails ingest algae etc
 plants through their diet and use the chloroplasts present in them for photosynthesis
 prakaash-sanshleshan evam shwasan kii kriyaayein ek duusare kii poorak evam vipareet hoti hai
 In photosynthesis, the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide and water results in the formation of glucose and release of oxygen
 shwasan main iske vipareet glucose ke oxikaran ke falswaroop jal tathaa carbondioxide banati hai
