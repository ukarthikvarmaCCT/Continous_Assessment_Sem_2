 The environmental consequences of this discovery revealed that, since the stratosphere ozone layer absorbs most of the ultraviolet-b radiations that reach the planet's surface, damage to the ozone layer by cfcs will increase UV-B radiation at the surface, As a result skin cancer and other effects such as damage to crops and seaweeds may increase

 Then, in 1985, Farman, Gardiner, and Franklin, scientists from the British Antarctic Survey, gave a shock to the scientific community when they published the results of the study of ozone "holes" in a journal called Nature - according to which the attenuation in polar ozone was, by some There was more than the perceived impairment

 The Indian ruler was so great, yet he is lost somewhere in the pages of history
 uske bare main aaj bhi bahut logon ko jaankaree nahin he
 His name is unknown to the people even today

 Yashwatrao Holkar was born in 1776 AD
 inke pita the - tukojirao holkar
 Due to the growing influence of the Holkar Empire, Daulatrao Scindia, the ruler of Gwalior, put Yashwantrao's elder brother Malharrao to death
 is ghatana ne yashwantrao ko puri tarah se tod diya tha
 They lost faith in their loved ones
 iske baad unhone khud ko majboot karnaa shuru kar diya
 He was very clever and brave in his work

 iske liye unhone nagpur ke bhonsle or gwalior ke sindhiya se ekbar phir haath milaayaa or angrejon ko khadedane kii thaanee
 But due to old enmity, Bhonsle and Scindia betrayed him again and Yashwantrao once again fell alone
 unhone anya shaskaon se ekbar phir ekajute hokar angrejon ke khilaaf ladane kaa aagrah kiya, lekin kisi ne unki baat nahin maani
 After this he decided to remind the British of the milk of the sixth on his own
 8 june 1804 i
 ko unhone angrejon kii sena ko dhul chataayee
 Then on 8 July 1804 AD, he drove the British out of Kota
 11 sitambar 1804 i
 ko angrej general velesle ne lord ljuk ko likhaa ki yadi yashwantrao par jaldi kaabo nahin paaya gaya to ve anya shaskaon ke saath milakar angrejon ko bharat se khaded denge
 In view of this, in November 1804 AD, the British attacked Dig
 is yuddh main bharatpur ke maharaj ranjit singh ke saath milakar unhone angrejon ko unki nani yaad dilaai
 Not only this, according to history, he had cut off the nose of 300 British
 achaanak ranjit singh ne bhi yashwantrao kaa saath chhod diya or angrajon se haath mila liya
 After this, Scindia shook hands with Yashwantrao's bravery
 angrejon kii chintaa bad gai
 Lord Luke wrote that Yashwantrao's army takes great pleasure in killing the British
 iske baad angrejon ne yah faisla kiya ki yashwantrao ke saath sandhi se hi baat sanbhal sakati he
 Therefore an unconditional treaty should be made with them
 unhen jo chahie, de diya jaae
 All the empire they have, all should be returned
 iske baavjood yashwantrao ne sandhi se inkaar kar diya
 They were engaged in uniting all the rulers
 ant main jab unhen safalataa nahin mili to unhone duusari chaal se angrejon ko maat dene kii sochi
 In view of this, he made a treaty with the British in 1805 AD
 angrejon ne unhen swatantra shaasha mana or unke saare kshetra lautaa die
 After this, he along with Scindia made another plan to drive out the British
 unhone sindhiya ko khat likhaa, lekin sindhiya dagebaaj nikle or vah khat angrejon ko dikhaa diya
 After this, the whole matter worsened again
 yashwantrao ne hallaa bol diya or angrejon ko akele dam par maat dene kii puri taiyaari main jute gaye
 For this, he opened an ammunition factory in Bhanpur
 isbaar unhone angrejon ko khadedane kii thaan lee thi
 Therefore, they were busy working day and night
 lagaataar mehnat karne ke kaaran unka swasthya bhi girane laga
 But he did not pay attention to this and he went to heaven on 28 October 1811 AD at the age of just 35 years
 is tarah se ek mahaan shaasha kaa ant ho gaya
 a ruler over whom the British could never accumulate authority
 ek aise shaasha kaa jinhone apni choti umr ko jang ke maidan main jhonk diya
 If the Indian rulers had supported them, perhaps the picture would have been different, but this did not happen and a great ruler Yashwantrao Holkar was lost and lost his bravery in the pages of history, which remains unknown today

 According to the census of India, this village is located in Tehsil Sambhal, District Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh
 sambandhit janaganana code: rajya code :09 jila code :135 tehsil code : 00721 Districts of Uttar Pradesh vah prayek vachan athwa qaraar jo kanoon dwaara pravartaneey ho athwa jiskaa kanoon dwaara paalan karaayaa ja sake, sanvida kehalaata he
 The current contract is characterized by its legal validity
 vachanpaalan, qaraar athwa kaul ke nirvaah ko sampoorn vishwa main or visheshat: bharat main bada mahatv diya gaya he
 The story of Dasharatha, the son of exile and self-demise of a son for pledge in Indian history, is popular
 rajasthan kaa madhyakaalin itihaas isi ujwal parampara se otprot he
 But this commitment has a spiritual and moral value, law was not behind it, nor was there any legal recognition
 parantu dhire dhire vyavsaayik sambandhon main vachanpaalan kii or use kanoonee manyata dene kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav bhi jeevanamoolyon evam naitikta ke hraas ke saath hi samaaj ne kiya or isi kaaran naitik tathaa aadhyatmik drushti se vachanpaalan jahaan gaun hota gaya, vaidhanik manyataprapt vyavsaayik vachanon ke paalan ke mahatv ko pramukhataa praapt hoti gai
 The legal history of Rome is interesting in this regard from a commercial and legal point of view
 vahaan sanvida kaa pracheenatam swaroop tha
 In its original form, this lending was related to merchandise
 dhire dhire rin ke liye bhi iskaa prayog hone laga
 It had certain formalities without which perfection would not have been attained
 bharat main bhi naarad or brihaspati ke granthon main vastuvikray, rin, saajhedaari or abhikartrutv ke sambandhon kaa ullekh he
 But the nature of the present contract is different from that, although the link of its development can also be linked to them
 vartmaan sanvida kii visheshta uski kanoonee manyata he
 Every promise or agreement which is enforceable by law or which can be upheld by law is a contract
 pracheen kaal main is kanoonee manyata par vishesh bal nahin tha balki bal tha uski aupchaarikaataaon main se yadi koi aupchaarikta kam rah jaati thi to sanvida purna nahin hoti thi
 Although the practice of contract in its various forms was in the business relations of the society, the term "contract" was discovered much later
 sanvida shabd bahut vyapak he
 Parts of the contract itself are sale, loan, mortgage, deposit, partnership, motherhood, marriage etc
 parantu apane vartmaan rup main sanvida ne nayaa kanoonee arth grahan kar liya he
 In India, its act was made in 1872 AD and contracts are regulated by the same Indian Contract Act
 isaliye bhartiya nyaayalay ab sanvida ke maamle main isi likhit kanoon kaa anusaran karne ko baadhya hai
 For the interpretation of the law, they should study this act and find suitable meaning and purpose
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium british sanvida kanoon par aadhaarit he parantu british sanvida adhinium kii sahaayta tabhi lee ja sakati he jab yaa to bhartiya sanvida adhinium kisi prashn par maun ho athwa uski vyavastha aspasht ho or british kanoon bhartiya avasthaa or saamaajik sthiti se asangat na ho
 a contract in its present form is a legal promise or an enforceable agreement by law
 isamen do aavashyak tatv hai - Agreement and kanoon dwaara use prabhaavasheel banaae jane kaa gun
 When at least two people are unanimous in relation to doing or abstaining from something, then it is called agreement
 qaraar ke liye kam se kam do pakshon kaa hona aavashyak he
 If "A" proposed to "B" that "B" make a picture of "A", he would give "B" five hundred rupees for this work
 "a" ke dwaara yah prastaav he
 If "B" accepts that he will make a picture for "A" in five solar rupees, then it is an agreement that is enforceable by law and can be made effective
 arthath ek vyakti akelaa hi koi qaraar nahin kar saktaa he qaraar ke liye qaraar sambandhi baton par ubhay paksh kii maansik ekaatmata hona aavashyak he
 This means that in relation to everything related to the agreement, the common parties understand the same meaning
 aisa na ho ki ek paksh ek arth or doosraa paksh doosraa arth samajhe
 "A" has two motorcars, one Ford and the other Chevrolet
 vah apni ford car paanch hajaar main bechnaa chahta he
 He offered to sell that car with "B"
 parantu "ba" ne "shevarlyt" car samajhakar use kharidne kii sweekruti pradaan kar di
 This agreement will not happen because "A" and "B" did not result in mental monotony in relation to the motorcar
 motorcar se "a" ne ford motorcar or "ba" ne shevarlyt car samajhi
 It is clear from the above statement that the proposal becomes an agreement only after acceptance
 prastaav vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai parantu saadhaarant: unka vargeekaran paanch shreniyon main kiya gaya he : 1
 Specific proposal, when a proposal is made to a certain person or persons, it is called a specific proposal
 chunki prastaav nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se kiya jaataa he, at: isamen sweekaar karanevaala vyakti, jise swikarta kaha jayega, nirdisht hota he
 In this, the acceptance notice must be given by the acceptor to the proposer
 2
 saamaanya prastaav vah prastaav he jo nishchit vyakti yaa vyaktiyon se nahin kiya jaataa balki sansar kaa koi vyakti ise sweekaar kar saktaa he
 That is why, like a specific proposal, it is not mandatory to give the information of acceptance to the proposer
 prastaav main prakatit or icchit kaary ko karnaa hi is prastaav kii sweekruti maani gai he
 3
 Explicit proposals are those proposals which are made in verbal or written form but clearly
 4
 sankethik prastaav ye prastaav shabdon dwaara na hokar kaary dwaara kiye jate hai
 There is a proposal to take passengers from one place to another in lieu of tickets, the train has to come to the station
 yah saamaanya prastaav kaa bhi udaarahan he kyonki iskaa swikarta purvanishchit nahin he
 5
 Continuous proposal In this proposal, a proposal to supply 5000 mana of wheat at a fixed rate
 is prastaav kii sweekruti ke uparant bhi ek paksh turant hi sampoorn gehun kharidne ko yaa doosraa paksh bechney ko baadhya nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Like the proposal and according to it determines a particular method or system of acceptance, there determines that method or system of acceptance, if there is no acceptance by that method or system of acceptance, then the proposer is forced to accept by that system Should give
 parantu jahaan sweekruti kii kisi pranali yaa vishisht vidhi kaa ullekh nahin ho, vahaan kisi yuktiyukt, sangat or uchit pranali dwaara sweekruti di ja sakati he
 Acceptance can also be explicitly by words or by act in symbolic form
 tikat lekar gantavy sthaan ko janevaali railgadee par yatri kaa baithna hi kaary dwaara company ke prastaav kii sweekruti he
 Mental acceptance alone cannot be considered acceptance
 shabdon main athwa kaary dwaara uski abhivyakti bhi aavashyak he
 Performing the tasks specified in the proposal is also considered acceptance of certain proposals
 parantu yah aavashyak he ki swikarta is kaary ko karne ke purv se hi prastaavak kii sharte jaanata ho
 If the acceptor performs the work specified in the offer without the knowledge of the offer, it cannot be considered acceptance of the offer
 ek vyakti goridutt ne apane bhattije kii khoj ke liye apane munim lalman ko bheja
 After Lalman's departure, Gauridutt announced a 501 rupee award for his nephew
 lalman munim gauridatt ke bhattije ko khoj laayaa or puraskaar kii maang kii
 The decision was made that since Lalman was not informed of the condition of the award before the search of the boy, nor was it known to receive the award, Lalman's task of finding the lost boy could not be considered acceptance of Gauridutt's proposal
 prastaav se utpann laabh ko sweekaar karnaa bhi upyukt dashaon main prastaav kii sweekruti samajhi jaati he
 Sitting in a bus from Varanasi to Prayag is acceptance of the offer of the bus owner and the acceptor is obliged to pay the bus fare
 sweekruti prastaav ke kaayam rahane kii dasha main honi chahie
 If the proposal has been nullified or has been rejected or withdrawn by the proposer, acceptance will also be null and void
 prastaavak kii soochna swikarta ko or prastaav kii sweekruti kii soochna prastaavak ko milanaa aavashyak he
 When the information of the proposal is received by the person to whom the proposal is made, then the convection or communication of the proposal is deemed complete
 "k" ne apni ghadi 150) main "kha" ko bechney kaa prastaav patr dwaara "kha" kii preshit kiya
 As soon as the letter "B" is received, the offer for "A" will be completed
 sweekrurta ke liye pruthak pruthak hota he
 When the acceptor sends his acceptance to the proposer in such a way that his withdrawal is not in the hands of the acceptor, the acceptance against the proposer reaches the proposer
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "kha" dwaara apni sweekruti kaa sanvahan purna samajha jayega parantu swikarta ke viruddh nahin
 Convection of acceptance against acceptance against the acceptor will be complete when the acceptance reaches the proposer
 uparyukt udhaaharan main "kha" dwaara apni sweekruti kaa patr "k" ke naam daalate hi sweekruti kii pabandi "k" naamak prastaavak ke viruddh ho jaaegi parantu swikarta "kha" ke viruddh nahin
 Completion of convection against "B" will occur when "A" receives its letter of acceptance
 jab prastaavak or swikarta ek duusare ke samaksh upasthit hon to sanvahan main koi pechidagi paidaa nahin hoti parantu jab donon do sthanon par hon to sanvahan kaa madhyam dak : patr yaa taar : hota he
 It is clear from the above statement that the letter of offer is not completed as soon as it is left by the proposer, but is completed only after reaching the acceptor
 isse yah bhi nishkarsh nikalataa he ki prastaavak or swikarta ek duusare ke samaksh upasthit hon to sanvahan main koi pechidagi paidaa nahin hoti parantu jab tak swikarta apni sweekruti kaa patr dak main nahin chhod detaa kyonki tab sweekruti kaa waapas liya janaa swikarta ke vash ke baahar ho jaataa he
 Every offer left by the acceptor in the mail is completed against the proposer
 upar kaha ja chukaa he ki sweekruti swikarta ke viruddh tab purna hoti he jab prastaavak ko praapt ho jaae
 Acceptors leave their acceptance letters in the post office before the proposer receives them, against the acceptor is also completed
 sweekrutapatr der main pahunchne yaa raste main kho jane par bhi prabhavakaari rahata he kyonki aisa mana gaya he ki dak vibhaag kii asaavadhaanee yaa bhul kaa koi prabhaav sanvida ke pakshon par padana nyaaysangat nahin he
 But if the letter for convection is not given in the post to the postman, then it is not enough convection because it is not included in the duties of the postman to leave every person's letter in the post
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium 1872 i
 kii dhara 10 ke anusaar aise sabhi qaraar sanvida maane gaye hai jo Negotiable parties swatantra sahmati se kiye jaae, Whose returns and objectives are valid and ukt adhinium dwaara nisatva na ghoshit kiye gaye hon
 It has also been clarified in this section that the above definition will not affect any such law, jiske dwaara kisi sanvida kaa likhit, yaa panjikrut sakshiyon kii gavaahi ke saath hona aavashyak he
 All such persons are considered to be contractual, who are adult, healthy minded and are not disqualified by any law
 falswaroop Minor, vikrut mastishkvaale vyakti yaa unmatta, jadbuddhi tathaa nashe main chur rahanevaale, And such persons, who are disqualified to contract by law, such as foreign enemies, foreign emperors or their representatives, enemies of the country, criminals etc
, cannot contract
 avasyak vyakti swatantra buddhi se apane laabh haani kaa nirnay nahin kar saktaa
 Hence, he is not considered as contractable
 vikrut mastik vaale vyaktiyon main agar vikruti asthaayee ho hri yani kabhi mastishk vaale vyaktiyon main agar vikruti asthaayee ho hri yani kabhi mastishk vikrut or kabhi swasth rahata ho hri to aise vyakti vikrutikaal main to nahin parantu mastishk kii swasthata ke kaal main sanvida kaa yogya paksh ho sakate hai1 apradhi kaa dandbhog ke samay sanvida karne kaa adhikaar nilambit ho jaataa he parantu dandbhog yaa kshamaprapti ke pashchaat use sanvida karne kii kshamta pun: praapt ho jaati he
 a person declared insolvent is also deprived of the ability to contract
 sanvida ke pakshon kii sahmati kaa swatantra hona sanvida kii ek pramukh aavashyaktaa he
 If the consent is not independent then the contract will be affected by it
 sahmati us dasha main swatantra maani jaati he jab yah 1
 Force or tragedy, 2
 avaanchit prabhaav, 3
 Treachery, 4
 bhrant kathan, yaa bhranti dwaara prabhavit nahin hui ho or na praapt kii gai ho
 The definition of force or tragedy is given in the Indian Contract Act
 uske anusaar balpravartan yaa traas ke chaar rup he : Performing acts punishable and punishable by the Indian Penal Law or karne kii dhamkee dena, chaahe us sthaan par jahaan yah kaary kiya jaae bhartiya dand vidhaan lagu ho yaa nahin, Unlawfully withholding the property of any person; Or roak rakhane kii dhamkee dena
 The purpose of this force or tragedy should be to make someone a party to the contract
 avaanchit prabhaav kii paribhaasha sanvida adhinium kii dhara 16 main di gai he
 According to him, the contract is said to be motivated by undue influence whose relations of the parties are such that one party uses that particular position with the will of the other party
 mata pita or bachche, abhibhavak or palya, vakil ore muvakkil, doctor or rogi, guru or shishy aadi ke sambandh aise hi hote hai jinamein pratham paksh duusare kii ichchhaaon ko apane vishisht sambandh ke kaaran prerit karata he
 In order to prove undue influence, it is also necessary to prove that in fact, on the other side of the party of special status, used its special position for its unfair advantage
 yadi yah baat siddh nahin hoti to keval vishisht sthiti ke hi kaaran koi sanvida avaanchit prabhaav dwaara prabhavit yaa parityajya nahin samajhi jaaegi
 This is described in Section 17 of the Contract Act
 uske anusaar sanvida ke kisi paksh dwaara yaa uski sajeesh se yaa uske abhikarta dwaara duusare paksh yaa uske abhikarta ko dhokhaa dene yaa chhalane yaa sanvida se sammilit hone ke liye prerit karne ke hetu nimnaankit kaary chhalkapat kehalaayenge : A) to tell the facts, which he does not believe in the truth, kha) aise tathy ko chhipaana jiskaa use gyaan yaa vishwaas na ho; C) to give a promise that does not wish to be fulfilled; gha) aisa kaary karnaa yaa usase virat hona jise kanoon vishesh rup se chhalkapat ghoshit karata ho; 4) To do other deceptive tasks
 qaraar ke sambandh main vichaar karte hue yah kaha gaya he ki ubhay paksh ke bich maansik mataiky kaa hona aavashyak he
 The fallacy is related to this
 isamen ek paksh ek vastu yaa baat or doosraa paksh duusari vastu yaa baat samajhataa he
 As a result, the contract seems to be seen in the upper way, but there is virtually no contract due to confusion
 ye bhrantiyaan kai prakaar kii hotin hai
 An example of confusion regarding content is given by Chevrolet and Ford Motor Cars in the pre-section
 isi prakaar sanvida ke paksh kii pahchaan main bhi bhranti sambhav he
 "A" contracted as "B", if it was in fact "B" and not "C", then it is a misconception of the identity of the party
 sanvida kii prakruti yaa arth sambandhi bhi bhranti ho sakati he
 If one of the later parties signs an agreement on the other party stating the application for taking the opportunity later, then the other party gets confused about the form or nature of the contract
 aisi dasha main hastakshar banaanevaale kaa mastishk uske hastakshar ke saath nahin he
 Yield is an essential element for covenant
 bina pratifal ke koi prasanvida nahin ho sakati; or yadi vah ho bhi to ni:satv yaa avaidh hoti he
 The return must also be valid
 udhaaharan swaroop "a", "ba" ko "sa" kii hatya ke liye 5000 ru
 detaa he or "ba" hatya ke liye vachan detaa he
 Here this contract is free because its reward is forbidden by murder law
 is prakaar nimnlikhit prakaar ke pratifal avaidh hote hai - 1
 The returns which are forbidden by law
 yadi koi pratifal spashtyaa yaa sankethik rup se kanoon dwaara varjit ho to uske aadhaar par nirmit prasanvida ni:satya hoti he
 This will become clear from the above example
 2
 yadi koi aisa pratifal ho jisase kisi adhinium kii koi vyavastha bhang hoti ho yaa nishphal hoti ho to vah pratifal avaidh mana jayega
 3
 Those returns which are fraudulent are considered illegal
 4
 vah pratifal jiske dwaara kisi vyakti ke sharir yaa sampatti ko haani pahunchati ho avaidh hota he
 For example, a promises to pay five hundred rupees to the editor of a newspaper if the offending details about Editor b are printed
 yahan pratifal avaidh he kyonki isse ba kii pratishtha par aghat pahunchataa he
 5
 Returns that are immoral are illegal
 6
 lokaneeti ke viruddh pratifal avaidh hote hai, jaise shatru ke saath vyapaar karnaa
 Contracts tending to cause harm to public service, contracts strangling lawsuits related to punishable offenses are disqualified
 vaidhanik karrwai kaa durupyog karne kii pravriti rakhanevaali sanvida, aisi sanvida jau naitikta ke viruddh ho, yaa vyaparnirodhak sanvida yaa kisi jo naitikta ke viruddh ho, yaa vyaparnirodhak sanvida yaa kisi vyavask vyakti ko shaadi karne se rokane ke liye sanvida, ityadi bhi lokaneeti ke viruddh evam ni:satv hotin hai
 The invalidation of even one of the aims and rewards makes the contract null
 yadi sanvida kaa uddeshy anshat: avaidh ho tab bhi sanvida ni:satv ho jaati he, yadi uske avaidh ansh ko vaid ansh se pruthak na kiya ja sake
 If the illegal share of the consideration or purpose can be separated from the valid portion, then the valid portion will be enforceable and the invalid share will be disqualified
 jaise "ba" ne "a" ko ek pratigyapaatr dwaara 2000 rupye dene kaa vachan diya jinamein se 1500 rupye purana rin tha or 500 rupye jue main haari rakam thi
 In this, the legitimate part can be separated from the illegal part; Therefore, this covenant will be valid for 1500 rupees, but 500) will be disqualified
 bhartiya sanvida adhinium ke antargat ni:satv ghoshit qaraar kanoon dwaara pravartaneey nahin ho sakate, yadhyapi usamen sanvida ke anya tatv purnat: vidyaman bhi hon

 It is not necessary for all agreements and contracts to be written, registered and with the testimony of witnesses, but such a contract, despite all other properties, is not valid due to lack of these formalities

 yahova ne manushya ko adan ke baag main rakhaa
 Man's job was to plant trees and care for the garden
 yahova parameshwar ne manushya ko ajna di, “tum baghiche ke kisi bhi ped se fal kha sakate ho
 But you cannot eat the fruit of the tree informing about good and bad
 yadi tumne us ped kaa fal kha liya to tum mar jaaoge
 Then Jehovah God said, "I understand that it is not right for a man to be alone
 main uske liye ek sahaayak banaaunga jo uske liye upyukt hoga
 " yahova ne prithvi ke har ek jaanavar or akaash ke har ek pakshi ko bhoomi kii mitti se banaaya
 The Lord brought all these creatures to man and man named each one
 manushya ne paaltu jaanwaron, akaash ke sabhi pakshiyon or jangal ke sabhi jaanwaron kaa naam rakhaa
 Man saw many animals and birds but man could not find any assistant who deserves it
 atah yahova parameshwar ne manushya ko gahari neend main sula diya or jab vah so rahaa tha, yahova parameshwar ne manushya ke sharir se ek pasli nikaal lee
 Then the Lord closed the man's skin from where he had taken the rib
 yahova parameshwar ne manushya kii pasli se stri kii rachana kii
 Then Jehovah God brought the woman to man
 isliye purush apane mata—pita ko chhodkar apni patni ke saath rahegaa or ve donon ek tan ho jaaenge
 Man and his wife were naked in the garden, but they were not ashamed
 yahova dwaara banaae gaye sabhi jaanwaron main sabase adhik chatur saanp tha
 The snake said, "O woman, has God really told you not to eat fruit from any tree in the garden?" The woman said, "no, God did not say that
 ham baag ke pedo se fal kha sakate hai
 But there is a tree whose fruits we cannot eat
 parameshwar ne ham logon se kaha, ‘baag ke bich ke ped ke fal tum nahin kha sakate, tum use choona bhi nahin, nahin to mar jaaoge
 "but the snake said to the woman," You will not die
 parameshwar jaanata he ki yadi tum log us ped se fal khaaoge to achche or bure ke bare main jaan jaaoge or tab tum parameshwar ke samaan ho jaaoge
 The woman saw that the tree was beautiful
 usne dekha ki fal khaane ke liye acha he or ped use budhimaan banayega
 Then the woman took fruit from the tree and ate it
 uskaa pati bhi uske saath tha isliye usne kuch fal use diya or usne use khaaya
 Then both men and women changed
 unki ankhen khul gayi or unhone vastuon ko bhinn drushti se dekha
 They notice that they have no clothes, they are bare
 isliye unhone kuch anjir ke pattey lekar unhen joda or kapado ke sthaan par apane liye pahana
 Then the man and woman heard the voice of the coming of the Lord God in the garden in the coldest day of the day
 ve baag me pedo ke bich main chhip gaye
 9 The Lord God cried and asked the man, "where are you?" The man said, "I heard your voice coming to the garden and i was afraid
" main nanga tha, isliye chhip gaya
 "the Lord God asked the man," Who told you that you are naked? What makes you shy? Did you eat the fruit of that particular tree that i had commanded you not to eat? "the man said," The woman you made for me gave me fruit from that tree, and i ate it
 ”tab yahova parameshwar ne stri se kaha, “yah tune kya kiya?” stri ne kaha, “saanp ne mujhe dhokhaa diya
 He fooled me and i ate the fruit
 yahova parameshwar ne manushya or uski patni ke liye jaanwaron ke chamadon se poshaak banaayi
 Then the Lord gave them this dress
 yahova parameshwar ne kaha, “dekho, purush hamaare jaisaa ho gaya he
 Man knows good and evil and now man can take fruit from the tree of life
 agar purush us fal ko khaayegaa to sadaa hi jivit rahegaa
 "then Jehovah God forced the man to leave the garden of Eden
 jis mitti se aadam bana tha us prithvi par aadam ko kadi mehnat kerani padi
 God drove Adam out of the garden
 tab parameshwar ne karub ko baag ke phatak kii rakhwali ke liye rakhaa
 God also placed a sword of fire there
 yah talwaar jivan ke ped ke raste kii rakhwali karti hui chaaron ore chamakati thi
 God created man in his image
 parameshwar ne ek purush or ek stri ko banaaya
 The day God created, blessed and named him "adam"
 jab aadam ek sau tees varsh kaa ho gaya tab vah ek or bachche kaa pita hua
 This son looked exactly like Adam
 aadam ne putr kaa naam shet rakhaa
 Adam lived eight hundred years after the birth of Seth
 in dinon main aadam ke anya putr or putriyaan paidaa huin
 In this way Adam lived for a full nine hundred and thirty years, then he died
 jab shet ek sau paanch varsh kaa ho gaya tab use enosh naam kaa putr paidaa hua
 Seth lived eight hundred and seven years after the birth of Enosh
 isi shet ke anya putr—putriyaan paidaa huin
 Thus Seth lived a full nine hundred and twelve years, then he died
 enosh jab navve varsh kaa hua, use kenan naam kaa putr paidaa hua
 Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after the birth of Kenan
 in dinon iske anya putr or putriyaan paidaa huin
 In this way Enosh lived nine hundred and five years, then he died
 jab kenan sattar varsh kaa hua, use mahalalel naam kaa putr paidaa hua
 After the birth of Mahalalel, Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years
 in dinon kenan ke duusare putr or putriyaan paidaa huin
 In this way Kenan lived nine hundred and ten years, then he died
 jab mahalalel pansth varsh kaa hua, use yered naam kaa putr paidaa hua
 Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years after the birth of Jared
 in dinon main use duusare putr or putriyaan paidaa huin
 In this way Mahalalel lived eight hundred ninety-five years
 tab vah mara
 When Jared was one hundred sixty-two years old, he was born a son named Enoch
 hanok ke janm ke baad yered aath sau varsh jivit rahaa
 In these days she was born to other sons and daughters
 20 is tarah yered puure nau sau bansth varsh jivit rahaa, tab vah mara

 These days her other sons and daughters were born

 2jab matushelah ek sau sattasi varsh kaa hua, use lemec naam kaa putr paidaa hua
 Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years after the birth of Lamech
 in dinon use duusare putr or putriyaan paidaa huin
 Thus Methuselah lived nine hundred and sixty-nine years, then he died
 jab lemec ek sau bayasi varsh kaa hua, vah ek putr kaa pita bana
 The son of Lamech was named Noah
 lemec ne kaha, “ham kisaan log bahut kadi mehnat karte hai kyanki parameshwar ne bhoomi ko shaap de diya he
 But Noah will give us rest
 ” After the birth of Noah, Lamech lived five hundred ninety-five years
 in dinon use duusare putr or putriyaan paidaa huin
 So Lamech lived seven hundred and seventy-seven years, then he died
 jab nuh paanch sau varsh kaa hua, uske shem, haam, or yepet naam ke putr hue
 After the birth of Noah, Lamech lived five hundred ninety-five years
 in dinon use duusare putr or putriyaan paidaa huin
 So Lamech lived seven hundred and seventy-seven years, then he died
 jab nuh paanch sau varsh kaa hua, uske shem, haam, or yepet naam ke putr hue
 Then the Lord said to Noah, “I have seen that you are a good person among the sinners of this time
 isliye tum apane parivaar ko ikattha karo or tum sabhi jahaaj main chale jaao
 Take seven pairs of each pure animal, and bring one pair of other unclean animals on the earth
 in sabhi jaanwaron ko apane saath jahaaz main le jaao
 Bring seven pairs of all birds flying in the air
 isse ye sabhi jaanavar prithvi par jivit rahenge, jab duusare jaanavar nasht ho jaayenge
 4 From now on, on the seventh day i will send very heavy rain on the earth
 yah varsha chalis din or chalis raat hoti rahegi
 All living creatures of the earth will be destroyed
 meri banaai sabhi chize khatm ho jaayengen
 Noah obeyed all that Jehovah commanded
 varsha aane ke samay nuh chah sau varsh kaa tha
 Noah and his family board the ship to escape the floodwaters
 nuh kii patni, uske putr or unki patniyaan uske saath thim
 All the pure animals of the earth and other animals, birds and all creeping creatures on the earth boarded the ship with 9 Noah
 in jaanwaron ke nar or maadaa jode parameshwar kii ajna ke anusaar jahaaj main chadhe
 Seven days of bad floods started
 dharti par varsha hone lagi
 On the seventh day of the second month, when Noah was six hundred years old, all the fountains under the ground opened and water started flowing from the ground
 usee din prithvi par baari varsha hone lagi
 It seemed as if the windows of the sky had opened
 chalis din or chalis raat tak varsha prithvi par hoti rahi
 On the same day Noah, his wife, his sons Shem, Ham and Japheth and their wives boarded the ship
 ve log or prithvi ke har ek prakaar ke jaanavar jahaaz main the
 All kinds of cattle, all kinds of creatures crawling on the earth and every kind of bird were in the ship
 ye sabhi jaanavar nuh ke saath jahaaz main chadhe
 These were pairs of living animals of every race
 parameshwar kii ajna ke anusaar sabhi jaanavar jahaaz main chadhe
 After closing in, the Lord closed the door
 chalis din tak prithvi par jal pralay hota rahaa
 Water began to rise and he lifted the ship above the ground
 jal badhata rahaa or jahaaz prithvi se bahut upar tairta rahaa
 The water rose so high that even the highest mountains drowned in water
 2jal pahaado ke upar badhata rahaa
 It was thirteen cubits higher than the tallest mountain
 prithvi ke sabhi jeev maare gaye
 Every man and woman died
 sabhi pakshi or sabhi tarah ke jaanavar mar gaye
 In this way, God destroyed every living being on the earth, every animal, every creeping creature and every bird
 ve sabhi prithvi se khatm ho gaye

 The term "'globalization'" has been used by economists since 1980, although it was used in the social sciences in the 1960s, but the concept did not become popular until the late 1980s and 1990s
 The earliest theoretical concepts of globalization were written by Charles Tez Russell, an American turned entrepreneur-minister who coined the term 'corporate giants' in 1897

 The term globalization was used by many, including Noam Shomsky, to analyze these developments
 aalochakon ne dekha he ki samakaleen upyog main is shabd ke kai arth hai, udhaaharan ke liye Noam Chomsky kehete hai ki : There are many aspects of globalization that affect the world in many different ways such as: vaishvikaran ke prabhaav ke saath or sanyukt rajya america kii apni arthvyavastha, kii madad se saath china ke janavaadee ganraajya ne pichley dashak main jabardast vikaas kaa anubhav kiya he
 If China continues to grow at the same rate set by trends, it is very likely that in the next twenty years it will become a major axis of power among world leaders
 China has enough to oppose the US for the post of major world power There will be wealth, industry and technology
 The European Union, the Russian Federation and India are among the already established world powers that probably have the potential to influence world politics in the future

 Liberals and proponents of laissez-faire capitalism state that in developed countries, the high share of political and economic freedom in the form of democracy and capitalism dissipates itself and at the same time produces high levels of property
 ve vaishvikaran ko udaartaa or poonjeewaad ke laabhakaari prasar ke rup main dekhte hai
 Proponents of democratic globalization are sometimes called pro-globalism
 They believe that the first phase of globalization was market-oriented, constructive world-class political institutions that represent the wishes of global citizens should be followed
 The difference of other globalists is that they do not define this ideology as modern, but they will leave it for free election of these citizens through a democratic process

 The term anti-globalization is used to describe the political outlook of people and groups who oppose the idealized liberal form of globalization
 "vaishvikaran virodh" main aisi kriyaayein yaa prakriyaayein shaamil hai jo kisi rajya ke dwaara isaki samprabhutaa ke pradarshan ke liye or loktantric faisle ke liye kii jaati hai
 Globalization protests may arise to prohibit international transfers of people, goods and ideology, which are particularly ensured by organizations such as the IMF or the World Trade Organization, and which radical regulation of free market fundamentalism over local governments and populations Apply in the program

 Many people who have been identified as being "anti-globalization" describe the term as very vague and inappropriate
 podonic ke anusaar "adhikansh samooh jo in virodhon main bhaag lete hai ve antarrashtriya network kaa samarthan praapt karte hai or ve saamanyatya vaishvikaran ke form jari karte hai jo loktantr ko badhaava dete hai

 Currently, critics of economic globalization see two aspects of this, one is the unforeseen damage seen in the biosphere and the other the perceived human costs, such as poverty, inequality, adulteration of races, increase in injustice, erosion of traditional culture
 According to critics, all these are the result of economic distortion related to globalization

 They claim that the consequences of globalization are unexpected but true
 vaishvikaran or vaishvikaran virdohi shabdon kaa prayog kai prakaar se kiya jaataa he
 Noam Chomsky states that aalochakon kaa tark he ki : The abundance of cheap labor is giving power to countries but is not able to remove inequality between nations
 yadi ye raashtra audyogic rashtron main viksit ho jaayen to saste shram kii sena vikaas ke saath dhire dhire gaayab ho jaayegi
yah sach he ki shramik apana kaam chhodane ke liye swatantra hai, lekin kai garib deshon main, iskaa matlab uske yaa uske puure parivaar ke liye bhukhmaree hoga agar pichhlaa rojgaar bhi unke liye ab uplabdh na ho
 In December 2007, World Bank economist Branko Milenovic did more empirical research on poverty and inequality in the world, as he noted that improvements in purchasing power indicate that developmental countries are worse off than they thought
 milinovik kii tippanee he ki "deshon ke abhisaran yaa apsaran par vidwaanon ke sankadon kagajaat ' pichley dashak main, jinamein aay par hamaari jaankaree ke aadhaar prakashit hue, ab galat aankade he
 With the new figures, economists will revise the calculation and possibly lead to new conclusions
 "also worth noting is that there are too many comments for estimates of global inequality and poverty
 nai sankhyaayein vaishvik asamanta ko itnaa adhik dikhaa raheen hai jitna ki ghor nirashaavadi lekhakon ne bhi nahin sochaa tha

 kray-abhikray ek prakaar kaa anubandh he jiskaa vikaas euke main hua
 Nowadays it is prevalent in China, India, Japan, Australia and New Zealand
 isko band-lijing bhi kehete hai
 When a buyer is unable to pay the value of a property in a lump sum but has the ability to deposit a small part of that value, the purchaser can borrow the property in exchange for the monthly rent using a purchase-purchase contract
 kainada or uese main ise 'kist yojana' kehete hai
 The purchase-contract-contract is considered a category of contract
 kray-abhikray ke niyaman ke liye koi swatantra vidhi nahin he
 Therefore, in addition to the terms of the contract, the rules of the contract law apply to it
 bombai hoicourt ke matanusaar kray-abhikray kii pratha kaa udai england main hua or vahiin se is prakaar ke anubandh bharat main bhi prachlit hue
 The legal meaning of purchase is - the owner of an article, in addition to raising his property at a certain rent, also pledges that the owner of the said item will sell the item when the owner of the said item satisfies the terms of the contract Will give

 We can call it a contract to sell
 vastuvikray ke in do prakaaron main prakat samya hote hue bhi chaar moulik antar hai- In the purchase-purchase contract, the item is delivered immediately to the renter
 kintu vikray anubandh se vastu ko turant kreta ke supurd karnaa aavashyak nahin hota
 The decision to ultimately buy or not to buy an item in purchase-purchase depends on the will of the person renting the item
 vikray-anubandh main ichha kaa prashn nahin uthta kyonki usamen vastu kaa vikray sampadit ho chukaa hota he, keval mulya kii adaayagi jari rahati he
 In purchase, this item can be returned to the owner of the item at any time within the time period stipulated in the contract
 at: swabhaavat: us vastu kaa usee samay tak kiraaya adaa karne kaa uttardaayitv abhikreta par hota he
 This question does not arise in the sales contract and the seller is entitled to recover the amount of all installments as the sale of the goods has been completed
 kray abhikray main yadhyapi vastu abhikreta ke supurd kar di jaati he tathaapi vastu kaa swaamitv us samay tak vastu ke malik main hi nihit rahata he jab tak ki abhikreta vastu kray k rane kaa nishchay prakat nahin karata
 But in the sale contract, although the payment of the price continues in installments, the ownership of the goods sold is vested in the buyer
 is antar kaa prabhaav yah he ki vikray anubandh main yadi vikreta kreta ko vastu hastantarit nahin karata to kreta vastu ke hastantaran ke liye daawa kar saktaa he or yadi kreta kishton kii adaayagi nahin karata to vikreta mulya kii vasuuli kaa daawa kar saktaa he
 But if the installment of the rent is not paid in the response, the owner of the item can claim the return of that item and the rent till that time
 saamaanya rup se kray-abhikray ke liye do pakshon kii hi aavashyaktaa hoti he vastu ke swami or abhikreta kii

 vastu vikray ke in prakaaron main tatsambandhi pakshon ke adhikaar tathaa uttardaayitv main antar hota he at: is prashn kaa nirnay ki koi samjhauta abhikrashnubandh he athwa vikrashnubandh, us samjhaute kii sharton ke arthvishleshan par hi nirbhar karata he
 The sale or reaction is not as important in the terms of the agreement as it is to see what the real intention of the two parties is
 yadi vastu praapt karanevaale par vastu lene kaa koi bhaar nahin he or vastu kaa swami bananaa yaa na bananaa uski ichha par chhod diya gaya he to kray vikray, kist aadi shabdon ke prayog ke baavjood use abhikray hi mana jayega
 Since purchase-contract is only a type of contract, the rules of minor contractual law also apply to it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kray abhikray keval chal sampatti ke liye hi nahin, achal sampatti ke liye bhi prayukt kiya ja saktaa he

 On the one hand some believe that the foundation of knowledge of all students should be the same, as the same type of curriculum; On the other hand, others want that students should have the right to pursue their preferred education, for this they can try to specialize in any subject in the beginning or can choose their subjects according to their choice

 Generally, more advanced courses in any discipline require the foundation of some basic courses, but some courses require study in other departments, such as some math classes required to specialize in physics or literature
 , Language proficiency required for students of music or scientific research
 Pre-requisites for each subject placed within a course must be taken into consideration when creating a more elaborate curriculum

 Ram Prasad 'bismil' was appointed on behalf of the society in 1915, when he came to Shahjahanpur for Arya Samaj for health benefits
 kishoravastha main swami somdev kii satsangati paakar balak ramprasad aage chalakar 'bismil' jaisaa bejod krantikari ban sakaa
 Ramprasad Bismil has written his brief but pithy biography titled My Gurudev in his autobiography
 somdev ji ucchkoti ke vaktaa to the hi, bahut achche lekhak bhi the
 Some of the articles and books he wrote were with a devotee who was destroyed by his carelessness
 unke kuch lekh prakashit bhi hue the
 He died at the age of 57
 swami somdev kaa asli naam brajalaal chopra tha
 Born in Lahore city of Punjab province, Brajlal's grandfather lived in the cabinet of Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 janm ke kuch samay baad maan kaa dehant ho jane ke kaaran daadi ne unki parvarish kii
 The only child of parents tried several times to kill Brijlal with poison by his aunts so that his boys get the property
 kintu chachaa ke sneh ke kaaran ve apane chachere bhaaiyon ke saath angreji skool main shiksha praapt kar sake
 Child Brajlal had a lot of compassion in his heart
 is kaaran vah aksar apni kitaaben va naye kapade garib sahpaathiyon ko de diya karte the or khud puraane hi pahanakar skool chale jate the
 When his uncle came to know that Brijlal distributes new clothes to poor students, he asked Brijlal to tell him when he wished to distribute clothes
 ve naye kapade banavaa diya karenge
 At least don't share your clothes with them
 yahi nahin bahut saare nirdhan vidhyaarthiyon ko apane ghar bulaakar bhojan bhi karaayaa karte the
 The aunts and cousins used to suffer a lot due to their generosity
 aakhirkaar brajalaal ne vivaah hi nahin kiya or roj-roj kii chikchik se tang aakar ek raat apana ghar bhi tyaag diya
 After wandering here and there for a long time, Brajlal reached Haridwar
 vahaan par unki mulaakaat ek siddh yogi se hui
 The child got what he wanted
 ab vah balak brajalaal se somdev ban chukaa tha
 Staying in the Guru's ashram, he received his full education in Yoga-lore
 yogiraj guru kii krupa se 15 se 20 ghante kii samadhi lagane kaa unhen abhyaas ho gaya
 Swami Somdev stayed in Haridwar for many years
 yogabhyas ke madhyam se ve apane sharir ke bhaar ko itnaa halkaa kar lete the ki pani par prithvi ke samaan chale jate the
 As soon as he wished to visit India, he left Haridwar one day and wandered, studied and meditated in many places
 germany tathaa america se shastron ke sambandh main bahut si pustaken mangvakar unka gambheer adhyayan kiya
 Somdev was in Lahore in the days when Lala Lajpat Rai was sentenced to exile
 vahaan se ek akhbaar nikaalane kii ichha se unhone aavedan diya
 The Deputy Commissioner of Lahore did not accept the application of any new newspaper at that time, but when he met Swami Somdev, he was impressed by his personality and accepted the application
 apane akhbaar kaa pehla hi sampadakeey unhone angrejon ko chetavanee ke naam se likhaa
 The article was so provocative that in a short time all copies of the newspaper were sold hands-on and a second edition of the same issue had to be published at the request of the public
 dipti kamishnar ke paas jaise hi isaki report pesh hui usne somdev ko apane karyaalay main bulawaaya
 After reading the article, he shuddered with anger and punched it on the table
 parantu lekh ke antim vaakyon ko padhakar shant ho jaataa
 At the end of that article, Somdev wrote - "if the British still do not understand, then the day is not far off that the scenes of 1857 should reappear in Hindustan and the children of the British should be slaughtered and their women be insulted
 kintu yah sab swapn he, yah sab swapn he
 "reading these words, the Deputy Commissioner would say -" Swami Somdev! You are very clever
 ham tumaara kuch nahin kar saktaa
