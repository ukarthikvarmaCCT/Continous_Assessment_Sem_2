 In biological research, chimeras are physically produced by mixing artificially the cells of two different organisms
 kymera sankar nahin hai, jo do prajatiyon ke janankosh ke sanlayan se gathit hote hai, jo ek ekal yugmanaj kaa nirmaan karte hai jo jitna sambhav ho utana vikaas karata he ; tulanaatmak rup se, kymera, do swatantra yugmanaj kii koshika kaa bhautik mishran hai: udhaaharan ke liye, ek ghode se or ek gadhe se
 "kymera" ek vyapak shabd he or ise aksar do alag-alag prajatiyon kii koshikaon ke mishran ke kai prakaar ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Some chimeras may result in the development of an adult animal composed of cells from both donors that may be of different species - for example, a 1984 fetus of a goat and a sheep produced a chimeric geep
 it was done
 is "geep" ne vikaas ke bare main buniyadi sawaalon kaa jawaab dene main bahut hi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai or ise banane main istemaal takanic, ek din luptpraaya prajatiyon ko bachaane main madadgaar sabit ho sakati he
 For example, if a goat's embryo is allowed to flourish in a sheep's womb, the sheep's immune system will reject the goat's embryonic development; But, if a geep was used instead of it, which has the mark of both sheep and goat, then the fetus of the goat can survive
 kuch luptpraaya jaanavar kii prajatiyon ko vilupt hone se rokane ke uddeshy se is abhyaas kaa vistaar kiya janaa sambhav he
 Such interracial chimeras, such as "geeps", are made in the laboratory and rarely with the purpose of producing living hybrid animals
 antarjaateey kymera ko banane ke liye ek khaas visheshta vaale ek pashu kii bhrun koshikaon ko ek alag visheshta vaale anya pashu ke bhrun main pratyaropit karke nirmit kiya jaataa he
 This practice is common in the field of embryology and has made a very important contribution to our current understanding of human and animal biology
 udhaaharan ke liye, alag rang ke yaa anyathaa anuvanshik rup se bhinn chuhon kii bhrun koshikaon ke mishran se, shodhakartaaon ne dekha ki kaise bhrun banaate hai or koun se ang or utak sambandhit hai 
 Hybridomas are not real chimeras as described above because they are not the result of a mixture of two cell types, but the fusion of two species of cells into a single cell, and artificial proliferation of this cell in the laboratory
 Hybridomas have been very important tools in the field of biomedical research for decades
 agast 2003 main, china main shanghai second medical uniwarsity ke shodhakartaaon ne kaha ki unhone pehla maanav cameric bhrun banane ke liye maanav twachaa koshikaon or mrit khargosh ke dimb kaa safaltaapurvak sanlayan kiya he
 The embryo was left to grow for several days in a laboratory environment, after which it was destroyed to exploit the stem cells that grow
 kyonki anusandhan maanav bhrun stem koshika kii ucch chikitsiya kshamta ke kaaran or in vitro nishechan clinics dwaara tyaag die gaye bhrun ke upyog lage america ke adhisthgan ke kaaran or saath hi saath sidhe anusandhan ke liye maanav bhrun ke upyog sambandhit anya chintaaon ke kaaran anusandhan ke liye vaigyanik anya vaikalpik raaston kii talash kar rahe hai
 However, rapid provable projects using partial-human and partial-animal chimeras as living plants have not only been used for biopharmaceutical production but also for cell or organ production for gene transplantation
 It has raised many questions related to morality and safety
 november 2006 ke dauraan, newcastle vishvavidhyalay or kings college landan ke british shodhakartaaon ne maanav diene ko gaay ke dimb ke saath mishrit karne ke liye maanav nishechan or bhrunvigyaan praadhikaran main ek teen varshiya license daayar kiya
 According to the proposal, human DNA would be inserted into the egg of a cow whose genetic material has been removed and then an embryo can be produced using the same technique from which the Dolly sheep were produced
 is shodh par kai saal pehle sanyukt rajya america main prayaas kiya gaya tha lekin usase is tarah kaa ek bhrun praapt karne main safalataa nahin mili
 In April 2008, researchers at the University of Newcastle reported that their research was successful

 Problems in which they gain insight include the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell traditions, and cell potential
 Common methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized by either injection or aggregation of embryonic cells of different origin
 pratham kymeric chuuhe kaa nirmaan 1960 ke dashak main beatris mintz dwaara aath koshika charan bhrun ke ekatrikaran ke madhyam se kiya gaya
 On the other hand, it was first injected by Richard Gardner and Ralph Brinster who injected the cell into the blastocysts to form chimeric mice in which the germ line was taken from ES cells
 Both the embryonic embryo, perimplantation and post transplantation
 Only one can contribute to the chimera
 yah post pratyaropan ke kaaran he ki ek blastocyst kii aantarik koshika dravyaman se ES koshikaayen, mooshak kii sabhi koshika vansh main yogadan kar sakati hai jisamen rogaanu pankti bhi shaamil he
 ES cells are also a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be transformed into them through the use of putative recombination, thus allowing gene targeting
 1999 main is khoj ke baad se ES koshikaayen, vishisht kymeric chuhon ke nirmaan main ek mahatvapurn upkaran ho gai hai
 The ability to make mouse chimeras comes from an understanding of early mouse development
 andey ke nishechan or ek blastocist ko garbhashay ke andar pratyaropit karne ke bich ke charan main, mooshak bhrun ke vibhinn bhaagon main vibhinn koshika vansh ko upjane kii kshamta barkaraar rahati he
 Once the embryo reaches the blastocyst stage it is made up of several parts, mainly the trophectoderm, inner cell mass, and primitive endoderm
 Each of these parts of the blastocyst grows into different parts of the embryo, the inner cell mass develops specifically the embryo, while the trophectoderm and primitive trophectoderm produce additional embryonic structures that support embryonic development
 do se aath koshika charan bhrun, kymera banane ke liye sakasham hai, kyonki vikaas ke in charnon par bhrun main koshikaayen abhi tak kisi vishesh koshika vansh ko janm dene ke liye patibaddh nahin hoti hai, ve aantarik koshika dravyaman yaa trophectoderm ko utpann kar sakati hai
 In the case where two diploid eight-cell stage embryos are used to construct a chimera, chimeraism can be found later in the epiblast, primitive, endoderm, and trophectoderm of the mouse blastocyst
 bhrun ko anya charnon main vichchhedit karnaa sambhav he taaki anya kii bajaay, kisi chuninda bhrun se tadnusaar koshika ke ek vansh ko utpann kiya ja sake
 For example, a subset of the blastomer can be used to generate chimeras with a specified cell lineage from an embryo
 udhaaharan ke liye, diploid blastocyst ke aatanrik koshika dravyaman kaa upyog aath koshika diploid bhrun ke anya blastocyst se ek kymera banane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, aatanrik koshika dravyaman se lee gai koshikaayen, kymera chuuhe main aadim indoderm or epiblast ko utpann karengi
is gyaan se kymera ke liye ES koshika yogadan main vikaas hua he
 ES cells can be used in combination with eight-cell and two-cell stage embryos to form chimeras and specifically produce embryos
 kymera main istemaal kiye jane vaale bhrun ko aage anuvanshik rup se parivartit kiya ja saktaa he taaki kymera ke keval ek hisse par vishesh rup se yogadan kiya ja sake
 An example is the chimera composed of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, tetraploids that have been artificially formed by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos
 tetroploid bhrun, kymera main vishesh rup se trophectoderm or aadim indoderm ko utpann karegaa
 There are many different combinations that can produce a successful chimera rod and an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be chosen according to the goal of the experiment, they are usually diploid embryos and ES cells, diploid embryos and diploid embryos, ES
 Cells and tetraploid embryos, diploid embryos and tetraploid embryos, occur in, but are not limited to, ES cells and ES cells
 The combination of diploid embryo is a common technique that is used to create chimeric mice, the gene targeting can be used in embryonic stem cells
 in prakaar ke kymera ko yaa to stem cell ke ekatrikaran or diploid bhrun ke madhyam se banaaya ja saktaa he yaa diploid bhrun main stem cell ke injection ke madhyam se kiya ja saktaa he
 If embryonic stem cells are used for targeting a gene to create a chimera, the following procedure is common, a construct will be introduced via electroporation to gain recombination for targeted genes in cultured mouse embryonic stem cells
 Positive cells will have antibiotic resistance to the event, provided that gene targeting is used
 Anastomosis by cassettes and should be able to be positively selected
 ES cells with the correct target gene are then injected into a diploid host rodent blastocyst
 in antahkshipt blastocysts ko phir ek chhadam garbhvatee mahila pratinidhi mooshak main pratyaropit kiya jaataa he, jo bhrun ko sthiti main laaegaa or aise mooshak ko janm degaa jiske rogaanu pankti ko daata mooshak ke ES koshikaon se liya gaya he
 isi samaan prakriya ko ES koshika or diploid bhrun ke ekatrikaran ke madhyam se praapt kiya ja saktaa he, diploid bhrun kaa sanvardhan ekatrikaran platon main kuon main hota he jahaan ekal bhrun feet ho sakate hai, in kuon main EC koshikaon ko joda jaataa he, samucchy ko tab tak sanvardhit kiya jaataa he jab tak ki ek ekal bhrun kaa gathan nahin ho jaataa or vah blastocyst charan tak pragati nahin kar letaa or phir use pratinidhi mooshak main sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 The US and Western Europe have strict rules and laws of ethics that explicitly forbid certain experiments using human cells
 yahaan tak ki europe or america ke bich, viniamak dhaanche main ek vishaal antar he
 
 In May 2008, there was a fierce debate in the British House of Commons on the ethics of making chimeras from human stem cells
 yah nirnay liya gaya ki bhrun ko prayogshaalaon main banane kii anumati keval isi shart par di jaayegi ki unhen pehle 14 dinon ke bheetar hi nasht karne kii guarantee di jaae
 sanyukt rajya america main bhi, is mudde par ek gahan vichaar-vimarsh hua ki kymera ke nirmaan main maanav stem koshika kii anumati di jaani chahie yaa nahin
 Many times this became a religious issue, where many leaders argued that it is against judeo-christian beliefs
 mongol bhashaa altaike bhashaakul kii tathaa yogtmak banaavat kii bhashaa he
 It is mainly spoken in Antarāt Mongol, the independent state of Inner Mongol, the Buryat Mongol state
 in kshetron ke aririkt iske bolanewaale manchuriya, china ke kuch kshetra or tibet tathaa afghanistan aadi main bhi paae jate hai
 It is estimated that there will be some 4 million Mongol speakers in all these areas
 in vishaal kshetron main rahanevaale mongol jati ke sab logon ke dwaara sweekrut koi ek adarsh bhashaa nahin he
 But within the so-called Mongolia, the Halha dialect of Democracy Mongol is gradually assuming the role of ideal language
 swayan mongolia ke log bhi is halha boli ko parishkrut boli maanate hai or isi boli ke nikat bhavishya main adarsh bhashaa banane kii sambhaavna he
 In ancient times, the literary Mongol written in the Mongol script was considered an ideal language among the educated people
 parantu ab yah mongol lipi janatantr mongolia dwaara tyaag di gai he or isaki jagah roosi lipi se banaai gai nai mongol lipi sweekaar kii gai he
 Thus, now the literary language written in Mongol script is less and the Halah dialect written in New Mongol script is considered more valid
 mongol bhashaa anek boliyon main vibhakt he
 Following are the main bids: purvi mongol Northern Branch - Burayat Dialects Northern Dialect Terti Dialect Eastern Dialect dakshini shakha- chahar boli Western mongol oirat shakha - Cobb's Oirat footkar boliyaan Dagor Heiler Boli; Chichihar dialect monguor boli Mogol dialect anya boliyaan The history of Mongol language can be divided into three periods, ancient, middle and modern
 12veen shatabdi tak kii bhashaa ko pracheen mongol, 13veen se 16veen shatabdi kii bhashaa ko madhyakaalin mongol tathaa 17veen shatabdi ke baad kii bhashaa ko aadhunik mongol kehete hai
 There is not much difference between medieval and modern Mongol
 pracheen mongol ke bare main spasht gyaat nahin he
 The history of Mongol literature begins with the history of the mystery of Mongolia built in the middle of the 13th century
 tathakthith aadhunik sahitya 1921 main hui anakranti ke aasapaas se aarambh hota he parantu ab tak mahatv kii rachanaayen adhik nahin hai
 Three important texts were written in the seven centuries up to 1920 before the birth of modern literature - the history of the mystery of Mongolia, the story of Gezer Khan and the city "mongolia ke rahasy kaa itihaas" sheershak granth main mongol jati ke janm se lekar chinagis khan tak kaa itihaas he or chinagis khan par vishesh bal diya gaya he
 It is written in very simple and beautiful language and poems are also mixed in between
 isamen choti si kamjor jati ke mongol logon ke ikatthe hokar kendriya sattatmak desh banane, parivarapradhan samaaj se badalakar jagiradaari samaaj banane tathaa chote se jagiradaaron ke ikatthe hokar bahut prabal desh banane tak kaa itihaas varnit he
 "the story of Gesar Khan" is the story of a man based on mythology
 isamen jagirdaar ore pujari varg ke virudv ladanevaali janata kii prashansa kii gai he
 "jangar" is a historical tale made in western Mongolia
 isamen ek purush ke kaaryo ke madhyam se janata ke kalyaan or sukh par jor diya gaya he
 Golden history is very famous in historical texts, the gem of history
 donon chinagis khan or uske uttaradhikariyon ke itihaas hai
 These include ancient Mongol mythology, folklore etc
 aadhunik sahitya 1921 kii janakranti tathaa jagiradaari pratha ke viruddh janata ke sangharsh se prerit hokar viksit hua he
 The basic source of modern literature is based on the socialist realist ideas based on the history of this struggle

 Damsdinsureng's "single" is also a very good work
 yah jagiradaari samaaj main du:khamay jivan vyateet kar rahi ek stri ke aadhunik samaajavaadee samaaj main hi anand praapt karne kii katha he
 In this way, some good creations have started coming out

 a business is a legally recognized institution created with the goal of providing a product or service to consumers
 vyavsaay ko 'company', 'interprise' yaa 'form' bhi kehete hai
 Business has a prominent place in the capitalist economies which are mostly in private hands and work with the aim of making profit and at the same time increase the business itself
 kintu sahakaari sansthaayen tathaa sarkaar dwaara chalaayi jaani vaali sansthaaen praaia: laabh ke bajaay anya uddeshyon kii purti ke liye banaayi gayi hoti hai
 We live in a commercial environment
 yah samaaj kaa ek anivaary ang he
 It fulfills our needs by providing a wide variety of goods and services through a wide network of business functions
 anya shabd - vyapaar, vyavsaay-pratishthan, form, dhandha, vyavsaay, karbar, kaarobaar, kaam-kaaj, kaam-dhandha, udhyam When we pay attention to our surroundings, we see that most people are engaged in some work
 adhyaaapak vidyalayon main padhaate hai, kisaan kheton main kaam karte hai, majdoor kaarkaanon main kaam karte hai, chaalak gaadiyaan chalaate hai, dukandaar saamaan bechate hai, chikitsak rogiyon ko dekhte hai aadi
 In this way every man is busy with some work all day, or sometimes overnight
 lekin ab prashn yah uthta he ki ham sab is tarah kisi na kisi kaam main apane aapako itnaa vyast kyon rakhte hai? iskaa sirf ek hi uttar he - 'apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye'
 By working in this way, we either fulfill our various responsibilities or earn money, so that we can buy the goods and services we need
 manushya dwaara kii jane vaali vibhinn kriyaayein maanviya kriyaayein kehalaati hai
 We can divide all these actions into two categories - jo kriyaayein dhan arjeet karne ke uddeshy se kii jaati hai, unhen aarthik kriyaayein kehete hai
 For example, the farmer grows the crop by plowing the field and earns money by selling it, the factory or office worker receives salary or wages in exchange for his work, the merchant earns profit from the sale and purchase of goods
 ye sabhi kriyaayein aarthik hai
 Activities that are performed for the purpose of achieving satisfaction, rather than earning money, are called uneconomical actions
 is tarah kii kriyaayein, saamaajik uttardayitvon kii purti, manoranjan yaa swasthya laabh ke liye kii jaati hai
 People visit places of worship, donate to a flood or earthquake relief fund, engage themselves in sports for health benefits, do gardening, listen to radio, watch television or perform other activities
 ye kuch udhaaharan anaarthik kriyaaon ke hai
 Economic activities are usually carried out for the purpose of earning money
 sadhrantaya log is tarah kii kriyaaon main niyamit rup main sanlagn hote hai, jise aarthik kriya kaha jaataa he
 Business can be defined as: vyavsaay kii nimnlikhit visheshtaayen hoti hai : The cultural heritage of India is very rich
 lekin shaayad yah bahut kam log jaanate honge ki pracheen kaal main bharat, arthvyavastha tathaa vyavsaay ke str par bahut hi viksit desh tha
 This is true with historical evidence, evidence obtained from excavations, literature and written documents 
 in sabase adhki bharat kii aseem dhan sampatti se aakarshith hokar vibhinn videshi akramanakariyon dwaara samay-samay par hue akraman bhi is tathy ko pramanit karte hai
 Ancient Indian civilization was not only based on prosperity, but its internal and external trade and commerce were also very advanced
 vyavsaayik jagat ke vibhinn kshetron main bharat kaa aseem yogadan he
 On comparing it with the occupations prevailing in other countries of the time, we find that Indian business was far ahead in its singularity, mobility (dynamic) and quality
 shuru ke dinon main bhartiya arthvyavastha purnatah krishi adhrith thi
 People used to produce their consumption items themselves
 vastuon ko bechney athwa vinimay kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin thi
 But with the development, the needs of the people started increasing
 jiske kaaran vastuon ke utpaadan main bhi vrudhi hone lagi
 People began to specialize in the production of various items of daily use and luxury, and thus they lacked the nature and scope of business and efficiency to produce other items of their use
 is prakaar inaki kushalta main vrudhi hone lagi or ye apni aavashyaktaa se adhki vastuon kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 Hence, to meet their other requirements, a system of exchange of their overproduced goods developed
 yah vyapaar kii shuruuaat thi
 Today, most people believe that much development in the field of business and trade in India has taken place only after attaining independence
 bharat, aaj audyogic utpaadan main itnaa sakasham ho gaya he ki ham sabhi vastuon kaa utpaadan deshi takanic ke prayog se kar sakate hai
 But it should not be taken from this that Indian civilization was not developed or advanced in the past
 jabaki hamen aaj bhi bharat kii samrudhi vyapaarik va vanijyik dhrohar par garv he
 You will be surprised to know that India started its journey in the field of trade and commerce 5000 years BC
 Had started kai aitihaasik saakshyon se yah pramanit hota he ki us samay bharat main suniyojit shahar the
 There was a worldwide fascination for Indian clothing, jewelery and perfumes etc
 yah bhi pramaan mili hai ki kaaphi samay se bhartiya vyapaariyon main vyavsaay ke liye mudra ke prayog kaa chalan tha
 Unions were popularized to protect the interests of traders, craftsmen and producers
 yah bharat main vyapaar va vaanijya ke jatil vikaas kii ore sanket karata he
 The merchants of India at that time not only weaved a network of strong internal trade routes, but also had commercial connections with merchants from Arabia, Central and South East Asia
 bharat vibhinn prakaar kii datu saamagree ke utpaadan main bhi sakriy tha, jaise tamba, pital kii vasteen, bartan, gahane tathaa sajaavati saamaan aadi
 Indian traders exported their products to different parts of the world and imported their products from there
 yah ek sarvavidit tathy he ki angrej sarvapratham bharat main vyapaar karne ke liye hi aae the, jinhone baad main yahaan apana rajya sthapit kar liya
 India has contributed to world trade and commerce in many ways

 Therefore we can say that India has its own rich commercial heritage, which has contributed significantly to its growth
 sabhi vyavsaayik kriyaayein kuch uddeshyon kii purti ke liye kii jaati hai
 Business objectives can be classified as follows: vyavsaay ke aarthik uddeshyon ke antargat laabh kamaane ke uddeshy ke saath ve samast aavashyak kriyaayein bhi aati hai, jinke dwaara laabh kamaane ke uddeshy kii purti kii jaati he, jaise graahak bananaa, niyamit nav pravartan tathaa uplabdh sansadhano kaa behatar upyog aadi
 Profit serves as the life force for business
 iske bina koi bhi vyavsaay pratiyogita ke bazaar main tikaa nahin rah saktaa
 In fact, the purpose of any business entity coming into existence is profit making
 laabh, vyavsaayee ko na keval uski aajeevika arjeet karne main sahaayta karata he, apitu laabh kaa ek bhaag vyavsaay main punah viniojit kar vyavsaayik gatividhyin ke vistaar main bhi sahaayak hota he
 Following are some other objectives of the business to achieve the primary objective of making profit: saamaajik uddeshy vyavsaay ke ve uddeshy hote hai, jinhen samaaj ke hiton ke liye praapt karnaa aavashyak hota he
 Therefore, the aim of every business should be to not harm the society in any way
 vyavsaay ke saamaajik uddeshyon ke antargat acchhee gunvattta vaali vastuon tathaa sevaaon kaa utpaadan tathaa purti, uchit vyapaarik prathaen apnaanaa, samaaj ke saamaanya kalyankari kaaryon main yogadan tathaa kalyankari suvidhaon main yogadan karnaa sammilit he
 Human purposes mean those objectives which have the goals of the welfare of the disabled and the disabled, deprived of education or training and fulfillment of the expectations of the employees
 is prakaar vyavsaay ke maanviya uddeshyon ke antargat karmchaariyon kii aarthik suraksha, saamaajik tathaa manovaigyanik santushti or maanav sansadhano kaa vikaas nihit he
 Business is an important part of the country, so the achievement of national goals and aspirations should be the objective of every business
 vyavsaay ke rashtriya uddeshy nimnlikhit hai: Earlier India had very limited trade relations with other countries
 tab vastuon kii aayaat or niryaat sambandhi nitiyaan bahut kathor thim, lekin aajkal udaaravaadi aarthik nitiyon ke kaaran kaaphi had tak videshi nivesh par pratibandh samaapt ho chukaa he, tathaa aaayaatit vastuon par lagane vaala shulk bhi kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 These changes have increased competition in the market
 aaj vaishvikaran ke kaaran puri duniya ek bade bazaar ke rup main parivartit ho chuki he
 Today, finished goods are easily available in one country
 is prakaar vishwa bazaar main pratispardhaa badhane se prayek vyavsaay apane mastishk main kuch uddeshy rakhkar kaam karne laga he, jise vaishvik uddeshy kaha ja saktaa he
 People run businesses with the aim of making a profit
 lekin keval laabh arjeet karnaa hi vyavsaay kaa ekmaatra uddeshy nahin hota
 Being a part of society, it also has to do a lot of social work
 yah vishesh rup se apane astitv kii suraksha main sanlagn swaamiyon, niveshkon, karmchaariyon tathaa saamaanya rup se samaaj vyavsaay kii prakruti tathaa kshetra va samudaay kii dekharekh kii jimmedaari bhi nibhaataa he
 Therefore, every business should bear responsibilities towards them in one way or the other
 udhaaharan ke liye, niveshkon ko uchit pratifal kii dar kaa aashwaasan dena, apane karmchaariyon ko acha vetan, suraksha, uchit kaary dashaayen uplabdh karana, apane graahakon ko acchhee gunvattta vaali vastuen uchit mulyon par ulabdh karana, paryaavaran kii suraksha karnaa tathaa isi prakaar ke anya bahut se kaary karne chahie
 While doing such work, two things should be specially taken care of for sustaining the social responsibilities of the business
 pehali to yah ki aisi prayek kriya rdhmarth kriya nahin hoti
 This means that if a business donates some money to a hospital or temple or a school or college, it will not be called its social responsibility, because donating does not discharge social responsibilities
 duusari baat yah he ki, is tarah kii kriyaayein kuch logon ke liye acchhee or kuch logon ke liye buree nahin honi chahie
 Suppose a businessman earns a lot of money by smuggling or shoving his customers and runs a hospital for free treatment of the poor, then his work is not socially justified
 saamaajik uttardaayitv kaa arth he ki ek vyavsaayee saamaajik kriyaaon ko sampann karte samay aisa kuch bhi na kare, jo samaaj ke liye hanikaarak ho
 Thus the concept of social responsibility encourages the businessman to earn profit through prudent management in lieu of unfair trade practices like hoarding and black marketing, tax evasion, adulteration, expulsion of customers
 yah karmchaariyon ko uchit kaary tathaa awasaiya suvidhen pradaan karke, graahakon ko utpaada vikray uparaant uchit sevaayen pradaan karke, paryaavaran pradooshan ko niyantrit karke tathaa prakritik sansadhanon kii suraksha dwaara sambhav he
 Having learned about the concept of social responsibility of the business and its importance, let us find out what the business has responsibilities towards its various interest groups on which it is dependent
 vyavsaay praayah swaamiyon, vinieveshkon, karmchaariyon, purtikartaaon, graahakon tathaa upabhoktaaon, pratiyogiyon, sarkaar tathaa samaaj par ashrith he
 These are called interest groups because the interests of these groups are directly or indirectly affected by each action of the business
 vyavsaay ke apane swaamiyon ke prati uttardaayitv hai : The business has responsibilities to its creditors: vyavsaay ke apane karmchaariyon ke prati nimnlikhit uttardaayitv hai : Following are the responsibilities of the business to its suppliers: graahakon ke prati vyavsaay ke uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : The business has the following responsibilities towards its competitors: sarkaar ke prati vyavsaay ke vibhinn uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : a society consists of individuals, groups, organizations, families etc
 ye sabhi samaaj ke sadsy hote hai
 All of them are similar with each other and depend on each other for almost all their activities
 in sabhi ke bich ek sambandh hota he, chaahe vah pratyaksh ho yaa apratyaksh
 Being a part of society, business should also help in maintaining relations between the members of the society
 iske liye use samaaj ke prati kuch nishchit uttardayitvon kaa nirvaah karnaa aavashyak he
 These responsibilities are as follows: ben mathew dacket ek antarrashtriya str ke cricket khilaadi he jo ki england kii rashtriya cricket team ke liye khelte hai

 There is disagreement on the definition of terrorism

 This is reflected in all important agreements including the United Nations Counter Terrorism Strategy, the decisions of the Conference on Madrid Terrorism, the European Parliament in the Round of Strategic Foresight Group and ALDE Tables

 In many countries the acts of terrorism are legally criminal acts committed for other purposes and "terrorism" is distinguished by statute, see Definition of terrorism for specific definitions

 In these definitions there are many that do not identify the possibility of the legitimate use of violence against an invasion by civilians in a occupied country, and thus will label all resistance movements as terrorist groups
 Others of violence Distinguishing between legal and illegal use

 Violence - According to Walter Laqueur's Center for Strategic and International Studies, "the only common symptom of terrorism is generally the consensus that terrorism involves violence and the threat of violence

 Terrorists also attack national symbols to show their power and shake the foundations that they are opposed to the country or society
 Increasing the validity of the time given to this may negatively affect the legitimacy of a government, terrorist organization and / or Ideology behind a terrorist action

 Terrorism is not a political strategy contrary to writing letters or protests, that is used by activists when they believe that any other means of change they wish would have such effect
 is badlaav ko itani buree tarah se asafalataa he ki nagarikon kii maut se bhi badtar ek parinaam ke rup main dekha jaataa he vaanchit he
 This often happens, where there is terrorism and religion between each other
 jab ek raajnneetik sangharsh ek yaa "dharmik brahmadia ke dhaanche main" ekikrut he is tarah ke ek pushtaini mathrubhumi yaa israel or jerushlem jaise pavitra sthal ke niyantran se adhik ke rup main sangharsh, raajnneetik lakshya main asafal aadhyatmik vifaltaa, ke saath baraabar ho jaataa he jo, ke liye atyant patibaddh, apni khud kii mrityu yaa mrityu se bhi badtar he nirdosh nagarikon kii
 Intentional targeting of non-combatants - it is common that the specific nature of terrorism is rooted in its deliberate and specific selection of civilians as direct targets
 In particular, criminal intent when infants, children, mothers and the elderly
 , Is shown to have been slaughtered or injured and put in the path of evil
 bahut samay kii, aatankwaad ke shikaar logon kyonki ve dhamkiyon rahe hai, par nahin lakshith kar rahe hai kyonki ve vishisht "pratikon, upkaran, jaanwaron yaa bhrasht praani" duniya ke ek vishesh drishy main taai he ki aatankwaadi ne kaha ki adhikari ho rahe hai

 When an enemy is identified as a warrior, the term terrorism is rarely used

 Unlawful or Unreasonable - Some officials add a criterion of the definition of terrorism to a "legitimate" government-authorized distinction between demeanor or impersonal action to make it legitimate and other actors, including those individuals and small groups
 The criterion, that terrorism otherwise The use of functions would not be justified as terrorism would not be considered if they were government approved
 If it were a "legitimate" government authorized by example For Rann, a city that is designed to influence civilian support for a reason, firebombing terrorism will not be considered
 This criterion is inherently and problematic because it is not universally accepted: this state Deny the existence of terrorism, whether it can perform the same task or as terrorism, based on whether its sponsorship is known to a "legitimate" government Security can not be; "validity" is kasuti saarvbhaumik sweekaar kiye jate hai nahin he in kaarnon ke liye

 From this point of view "terrorism" and "terrorist" carry a strong negative connotation
 These terms are often used to denounce violence or threats of violence by some actors as labeled as political, indiscriminate, immoral or Inappropriate
 Those "terrorists" labels are rarely so and usually use other euphemistic words or words specific to their situation, such as: separatist, independent Fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, as the paramilitaries, guerrilla rebel ,, ,, jihadi or mujaheddin, identify himself or en: fedayeen, or meaning of any word in other languages similar

 Wars during military action by states are generally not considered terrorism, even when they involve significant civilian casualties

 " rajya aatankwaad sarkari agenton yaa balon dwaara aatankwaadi vaardaaton kaa ullekh karne ke liye prayog kiya gaya he
 This involves the use of state resources by employing foreign policies of a state, such as performing acts of state terrorism considered directly by using its military
 Professor of Political Science, Michael Stohl, of London, Germany Examples of bombing and US nuclear destruction include cites Hiroshima during World War II
 He said the use of terror tactics is more common in international relations that the state has been and remains a more likely possibility of terrorism than employer insurgents argue within the international system

 "ve kehete hai ki aatankwaad ke sansthagat rup he ki vishwa yuddh daaloonga nimnlikhit jagah le lee parivartan kaa ek parinaam ke rup main hui bahes he
 In this analysis, the presence of state terrorism as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction and shaped the rapidly growing accepted form of behavior of the state to lead such Legitimizing violent behavior of

 This pattern can be observed in all situations ranging from Colombia to Colombo and the Philippines to Palestine
 pratikriyaaon ko aatankwaad ke daayre main vyapak rahe hai
 They can include re-alignments of the fundamental values of the political spectrum and reassessments
 The word terrorism, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors, has a narrower connotation
 pratikriyaaon ke vishisht prakaar main shaamil hai: Media risk is the primary goal of taking them out of terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media
 kuch herpher or shoshan ko media ke liye is par vichaar karen
 Others, expressed by a view of itself, consider terrorism to be a symptom of a highly controlled mass media, which would otherwise not give voice to alternative viewpoints because Paul Watson who "filled you in any other way" i cannot find your information that the controlled media is responsible for terrorism, "he said
 paul watasan kaa sanghathan samudr Shepherd swayan kiya gaya "branded heparisthitiki aatankwaadi ", haalanki yah daawa he ki koi bhi hataahat kaaran nahin he
 This mass media will often censor organizations further involved in terrorism to discourage further terrorism
 baharhaal, is sanghathanon aatankwaad ke jansanchaar madhyamon main dikhaaye jane ke liye or adhik ativaadee krityon kaa paalan karne ke liye protsaahit kar sakate hai
 This season Underground Joe went to America, a militant organization demonstrating terrorist incidents to bring media attention to various world political issues, while causing no casualties
 is mudde se kai sankshipt die gaye samachar sevaaon dwaara aatankwaadi vaardaaton ke sambandh main hi ullekh he
 The modern English word "terrorism" dates back to 1795 when it was used to describe the actions of the people of Jacobin Club in their later rule of revolutionary France, the so-called "state of terror"

 mikhail alexandrovich shologov kaa janm ek nimna madhyavargeey roosi kisaan parivaar main 24 may 1905 i0 ko hua tha
 His family lived in Kruzhilin Khutor in Veshenskaya Stnitsa, a former territory of the two Kazak army
 unke pita ne kheti or pashuon ke vyapaar se lekar kapadaa bunane tak kai kaam kiye
 His illiterate mother belonged to a Ukrainian peasant family and was the widow of a Kazak
 baad main apane bete se chitthee-patri ke uddeshy se unhone likhnaa padhanaa siikhaa tha
 Mikhail Sholokhov was educated in several schools in Kargin, Boguchar and Veshenskaya
 unhone ek shramik, saamaanya clerk or adhyaaapak ke rup main kaary kiya tha
 Walking through the wide fields filled with sunlight, Mikhail had seen the naked realities of life from his childhood
 unka sharir is baat kaa sakshi tha-- jo dhoop main lagaataar tapate rahane ke kaaran tamra varna main badal gaya tha
 During his youth, he worked hard in the fields, plowed, sowed seeds and harvested crops
 don nadi main machuaaron kii choti dongi main us pradesh kaa chappa-chappa chaan maaraa tha
 He had learned to laugh even in difficult situations
 1918 main jab upree don kshetra bhi grihayuddh kii chapet main aa gaya to shologov kii padhai kaa silsilaa asamay hi samaapt ho gaya
 In the historic moment of judgment, Sholokhov showed no hesitation in choosing his path
 us samay upree don kshetra main soviet virdohi shwet gardon kii bachi-khuchi tukadiyon kii vidhvansak karravaayiyon or kazzaakon ke vidrohon ke khilaaf bolshevik jujh rahe the
 Sholokhov favored the Bolsheviks and joined the Red Army and took on the reactionaries
 in anubhavon kaa istemaal aage chalakar unhone apni kritiyon main kiya
 Till 1922 he lived in the area of both
 in dinon unhen vibhinn paristhitiyon main rahanaa padaa tha

 He had an inclination towards literature since childhood

 The publication of Sholokhov's works started from 1923 AD
 1925 main unki pehali pustak don kii kahaniyaan prakashit hui
 Sholokhov's creative growth was rapid
 kam umr ke baavjood unka jivananubhav samrudh ho chukaa tha

 in kritiyon ne shologov ko siddhi evam prasiddhi donon ke shikhar par pahunchaa diya
 In Sholokhov there is a fine chemical mixture of the characteristics of his former top storytellers; Yet they seem completely separate from them and their contemporaries

 asahmatiyon ke baavjood ve sabake saath samvaad karne ke liye darwaja khulaa rakhte the
 The relationship he built from Raipur to Delhi lacked artificiality and texture
 ve hameshaa apane jivan or karm se keval or keval party kii sochate rahe
 His son Amar Agarwal left his hometown Kharsia and Raigad to make Bilaspur a separate city in Chhattisgarh as his constituency, started work as a Yuva Morcha activist and won the traditional Congress seat there
 aaj ve chhattisgarh ke sakasham mantriyon main gine jate hai
 Nobody doubts his abilities
 aise kathin samay main jab raajnneeti main maryaadavihin aacharan ke chinh aam hai
 Every kind of downfall is visible in the political arena
 lakhiram agarwal jaise nayak kii yaad hamen prerit karti he or bataati he ki kaise vyapaar main rahakar bhi shuchita banaae rakhi ja sakati he
 Even after being a householder, how can the work of the society be done by giving full time
 kya aap ise saahas nahin maanengen ki kis tarah mapra ke sabase kaddavar mukhyamantri rahe arjuna singh ke khilaap apane kshetra main vyuh rachana taiyaar karte or jiske parinaamon kii chintaa nahin karte? ajit jogi jaise taqatvar mukhyamantri ke saamne tanakar khadaa hote he or apane dal kii sarkaar kii sthapana ke liye puraa jor laga dete he
 Today the memory of Lakhiram Agarwal seems very natural and touching
 lakhiram agarwal ne chhattisgarh ke ek chote se nagar kharsia se jo yatra shuru kii vah unhen madhya pradesh bhaajapa ke adhyaksh jaise mahatvapurn pad tak le gayi
 He was also a two-time member of the Rajya Sabha
 lekin ye baaten bahut myne nahin rakhti
 What matters is the context and the lifestyle they teach people while doing party work
 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii bhartiya janata party ke liye unka yogadan kisi se chipa nahin he
 He was ultimately an activist and his heart beats for the organization itself
 bhaajapa diggaj kushabhau thakare se unki mulaakaat ne sahi myne main lakhiram agarwal ko puri tarah roopantarit kar diya
 They started living the organization
 kharsia nagar palika ke adhyaksh ke rup main prarambh huyi unki raajnneetik yatra main anek aise padaav hai jo prerit karte hai or protsaahit karte hai
 He also explains how a person from an ordinary family can also become an extraordinary personality
 lakhiram agarwal ke hisse badi raajnneetik safaltaaen nahin hai, kharsia se ve vidhansabha kaa chunaav nahin jeet sake
 His area is such a stronghold of Congress where till today the bjp's lotus could not blossom
 kintu apni is kamajori ko unhone apni shakti bana liya
 He started efforts to feed lotus in Chhattisgarh
 aaj puure rajya main kaaryakartaaon kaa puraa tantra unki prerana se hi kaam kar rahaa he
 Those workers understood the process of construction
 unke nirmaan or unke vyavasthaapan kii chintaa karte the
 It is this understanding of organization that elevates them among their contemporaries
 aap dekhen to lakhiram agarwal ke paas aisa kuch nahin tha jiske aadhaar par ve mahatvapurn banane kii yatra shuru kar saken
 Kharsia was a region where the BJP has no base
 ek chota nagar jahaan kii raajnneetik ahmiyat bhi bahut nahin he
 Along with this, Lakiram ji was also not a serious knowledgeer or scholar of any subject
 kintu unamem sanghathan shaastra kii gahari samaj thi
 Through his constant migration and labor, he overcame all obstacles
 jashpur ke kumaar sahab dilip singh judev, kawardha ke ek doctor raman singh se lekar tapakaraa ke ek noujvaan adivasee netaa nandkumar saay se lekar aaj kii peedi ke rajesh munat jaise logon ko saath lene or khadaa karne kaa madda unamem tha
 In every city and region of Chhattisgarh, he raised such people who are today commanding the party
 aalochanaon se avichal rahakar unhone sirf behatar parinaam die
 Recall the Kharsia by-election in which Kumar Dilip Singh Judeo was pitted against the strong Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Arjun Singh
 vah upachunaav harkar bhi bhaajapa ne chhattisgarh kshetra main jo aatmavishvaas arjeet kiya, vah ek itihaas he
 After this, the BJP did not look back in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgarh rajya kaa gathan is kshetra ke nivaasiyon kaa ek bada sapana tha
 In this, the formation of a BJP government in Delhi proved to be a happy coincidence
 yah bhi sanyog hi tha ki dilli main rajyasabha ke sadsy ke naate hi nahin, ek sanghathankarta ke naate lakhiram agarwal apni ek saakh pahchaan bana chuke the
 a whole team of his influence and abilities was starting to believe iron
 rajya gathan ko lekar unki pahal kaa bhi ek khaas asar tha ki tatkaaleen grahamantri laalkrishna adwani chhattisgarh rajya ke gathan ke liye sahamat ho gaye
 With this, Chhattisgarh got its own geography
 rajya main congress vidhayakon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par ajit jogi rajya ke pratham mukhyamantri bane
 The bjp's organization was shaken by his style of functioning
 bhaajapa ke 12 vidhayakon kaa dalbadal karwaakar jogi ne bhaajapa kii qamar tod di
 In such a situation, the restraint, patience and strategy of Lakhiram Agarwal as the head of the organization laid the foundation for bringing BJP to power
 sarkari aatank ke bich bhaajapa kii vaapasi saadhaaran nahin thi
 But the solidarity and continuous labor of leaders like Lakhiram Aggarwal, Dr
 Raman Singh, Dilip Singh Judeo, Nandkumar Sai, Ramesh Bais, Baliram Kashyap, Brijmohan Agarwal, Virendra Pandey, Banwarilal Agarwal, Premprakash Pandey paved the way for BJP to become its government
 gave
 yah vijay saadhaaran vijay nahin thi
 In such a difficult time, the contribution of Lakhiram Aggarwal and the then Organization Minister Saudan Singh cannot be blamed for giving life to the organization and giving it new confidence
 yah vahi samay tha jab log rajya main bhaajapa ke samaapt hone kii ghoshnaaen kar rahe the or bhaajapa kaa marsia pard rahe the
 But time took a turn and BJP formed its government under the leadership of Dr
 Raman Singh
 mukhyamantri raman singh ne raigarh main yojit vishaal swasthya shivi main kaha kii-kisi garib ko bhatakana nahin padegaa
 Hope Raman Singh's point is proved right and soon a day should come that no one has to go astray for the treatment of the poor or for the treatment of any of his close ones, because many people in the weekly public demonstration program at the Chief Minister's residence For better treatment, you reach for help, who are not in a position to bear the huge expense, on the other hand, between poor forced and inaccessible people
 The major difference is one thing to tell a recent time as i had read and was probably the right time to take a tumble Auto had found the answer to help the 108 is what a VIP reached the Hwaijwaj an anxious night better treatment
 udhaaharan or bhi bahut se he jinhen ginaya ja saktaa he par itani hi guzarish he mukhyamantri mahoday se jo aapane kaha he vah jald se jald kar ke dikhaae taaki kisi garib kii samuchit ilaaj ke abhaav main jaan na jaayen

 Therefore, we can say that the creation of Ayurveda dates back to 3,000 to 50,000 years BC, ie, with or around the origin of creation
 is shaastra ke aadi acharya ashvinikumar maane jate hai jinhone daksh prajapati ke dhad main bakre kaa sir joda tha
 Indra acquired this knowledge from Ashwini Kumar
 indra ne dhanvantari ko sikhaaya
 King of Kashi, Divodas is said to be the incarnation of Dhanvantari
 unase jaakar sushrut ne ayurveda padhaa
 Atri and Bharadwaj are also considered to be the promoters of this scripture
 apurveda ke acharya ye hai— ashvinikumar, dhanvantari, divodas, nakul, sahadev, arki, chyavan, janak, budh, jawal, jajali, pel, karath, agast, atri tathaa unke chah shishy, sushrut or charak
 In the context of historical knowledge of Ayurveda, the first mention of knowledge, according to Charaka, is the mention of Agnivesh - with the descent of Ayurveda in the death of the dead
 sarvapratham brahma se prajapati ne, prajapati se ashvini kumaron ne, unase indra ne or indra se bharadwaj ne ayurveda kaa adhyayan kiya
 The tenure of Chyavan Rishi has also been considered a contemporary of Ashwini Kumars
 ayurveda ke vikaas me rishi chyavan kaa atimahatvapurn yogadan he
 Then Bharadwaj got a long happy and healthy life under the influence of Ayurveda and propagated it among other sages
 tadnantar punarvasu aatreya ne agnivesh, bhel, jatu, parashar, harit or ksharpani naamak chah shishyon ko ayurveda kaa upadesh diya
 The most intelligent of these six disciples, Agnivesh first created a Samhita - the Agnivesh Tantra which was later re-invented by Charaka and named it Charaksamhita, which is the foundation pillar of Ayurveda
 sushrut ke anusaar kashiraj divodas ke rup main avatarit bhagwaan dhanvantari ke paas anya maharshiryon ke saath sushrut jab ayurveda kaa adhyayan karne hetu gayi or unase aavedan kiya
 At that time, Lord Dhanvantari preached to them that Brahma himself first published the Upveda Ayurveda of Atharvaveda in a thousand chapters - Shata Sahasra Shlokas before the creation of the universe and then divided it into eight organs by considering the human being as short-sighted
 is prakaar dhanvantari ne bhi ayurveda kaa prakaashan brahmadev dwaara hi pratipaadit kiya hua mana he
 Lord Dhanvantari again said that Daksha Prajapati from Brahma, Ashvinikumar Dwya from him and Indra studied Ayurveda from him
 ayurveda ke itihaas ko mukhyatya teen bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he - The time of the Code was in the 5th century BC
 It is believed to be from the 6th century
 yah kaal ayurveda kii moulik rachanaaon kaa yug tha
 At this time, Acharyo, on the strength of his talent and experience, practiced his erudite texts about different organs

 In this period, commentators on the compositions of the Samhidakala formulated mature and healthy interpretations
 is samay ke acharya dalhad kii sushrut samhita tikaa ayurveda jagat main ati mahatvapurn maani jaati he
 The research text 'rasaratnasamuchaya' is also a composition of this period, which has been written by Acharya Vagbhat based on Charaka and Sushruta Samhita and the composition of many rasastriyas
 is kaal kaa samay 14veen shatee se lekar aadhunik kaal tak mana jaataa he
 This period has been the period of writings of texts on specific subjects
 madhavnidan, jverdarpan aadi granth bhi isi kaal main likhe gayi
 Special attention was also paid to various forms of medicine in this period, which is relevant even in the present day
 is kaal main ayurveda kaa vistaar evam prayog bahut bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 It is clear that the antiquity of Ayurveda has been proved since the Vedas
 aadhunik chikitsapaddati main saamaajik chikitsa paddati ko ek nai vichaardhara mana jaataa he, parantu yah koi nai vichaardhaara nahin apitu yah uski punrariti maatr he, jiskaa ullekh 2500 varshon se bhi pehle ayurveda main kiya gaya he
 Vedas have been the pillars of human civilization since ancient times
 veda kii parampara main rudra ko pratham vaidya sweekaar kiya gaya he
 In the 'yajurveda' it is said that 'the first divine beggar'
 tathaa isi prakaar rugveda main bhi ullikhit he ki ‘bhishaktman twaan bhishjaan shrinomi'
 And in the tradition of Ayurveda texts, Brahma is the first preceptor of Ayurveda
 vedon main ashwinon or rudradevataa ke atirikt agni, varun, indra, ap tathaa marut ko bhi 'bhishak' shabd se abhinihit kiya gaya he
 But this term is mainly related to Rudra and Ashwinou
 atah veda ayurvedashastra ke liye ek mahatvapurn sanketak tathaa strot hai
 a description of important facts of Ayurveda is available in the Rigveda
 rugveda main ayurveda kaa uddeshy, vaidya ke gun-karm, vividh aushadhiyon ke laabh tathaa sharir ke ang or agnichikitsa, jalchikitsa, suryachikitsa, shalyachikitsa, vicchikitsa, vaseekaran aadi kaa vistrut vivaran praapt hota he

 The following topics related to Ayurveda are found in the Yajurveda: names of different medicines, different parts of the body, medicinal properties, karma therapy, neurology, fast domination etc
 isamen 82 aushadhiyon kaa ullekh diya gaya he
 The contribution of Samaveda as a study of Ayurveda is minimal
 isamen mukhyatya ayurveda se sambandhit kuch mantra main vaidya, tathaa atyalp rogon kii chikitsa kaa varnan praapt hota he
 The place of Atharvaveda is very important from the point of view of Ayurveda
 isamen ayurveda ke praayah sabhi angon evam upangon kaa vistrut vivaran miltaa he
 The Atharvaveda is the root of Ayurveda
 atharvaveda main ayurveda se sambandhit vibhinn vishyon kaa varnan uplabdh he jinamein se mukhya he- ‘vaidya ke gun, karm yaa bhishaj, bhishajya, dderghaayushya, bajeekaran, roganashak vibhinn maniyan, pranchikitsa, shalyachikitsa, vaseekaran, jalchikitsa, suryachikitsa tathaa vividh aushadhiyon ke naam, gun, karm aadi
 Ayurveda is known as ‘bheshaj’ or ‘bhishgveda’ in the Arthaveda
 gopath brahman main bhi atharvaveda ke mantron ko ayurveda se sambandhit bataaya gaya he
 In the Shatapatha Brahmana, in the interpretation of a mantra of the Yajurveda, Prana is called 'atharva'
 iskaa arth yah he ki pranavidya yaa jivanvidya atharvan vidya hi he
 According to the Gopatha Brahmin, "angiras is directly related to Ayurveda and physiology
 angon ke rason arthath tattvon kaa varnan jisamen praapt hota he vah angiras kaha jaataa he
 The juice which comes out from the organs is Angarasa and the same is called Angiras
 atharvaveda ko vaidic jagat main kshatraved, brahmaveda, bhishagved tathaa arghinroved ityadi naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is clear that hundreds of mantras related to Ayurveda are mentioned in the Vedas, in which the treatment of various diseases is mentioned
 rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda - in chaaron vedon main atharvaveda ko hi ayurveda kii aatma mana gaya he
 In the Atharvaveda, Swasthayana Mangalakarma, fasting, sacrifice, home, niyam, atonement and mantra etc
 have also been asked to do treatment
 atharvaveda main sarvaadhik 289 aushadhiyon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Thus, it is known that detailed description of ayurvedic medicines is found in the Atharvaveda itself
 ayurveda ke mul granthon main kaashyap samhita, charak samhita, sushrut samhita, bhelasanhita tathaa bharadwaj samhita main se kaashyap samhita ko ati pracheen mana gaya he
 In this, Maharishi Kashyap has also given a description of these four subjects in the style of skeptic solution in the style of grievous diseases, their diagnosis, preservation of diseases and means of prevention of diseases
