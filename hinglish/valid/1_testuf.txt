bharat main loksabhaa evam vidhaan sabhaaon ke chunaavon main isi pranali kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 It is also called the "simple majority system"
 jis ummidavaar ko sabase adhik mat praapt hote hai vahi chun liya jaataa he
 This system is generally associated with the one-member constituency system
 is pranali kii aalochana main teen baaten kahi jaati hai
 The first is that the candidate with the highest number of votes is elected under it, even if a large community of the electoral college has voted against him
 alpsankhyak samudaay dwaara nirvaachit hone par bhi vah viruddh mat rakhane vaale bahusankhyak samudaay kaa bhi pratinidhi ban jaataa he
 This was the case with many winning candidates in the first election of 1952 in India
 duusari baat yah he ki yah pranali britain ke samaan dwidaleey parampara ke hi anukool hoti he kintu usase durbal or alpsankhyak dalon kaa safaya ho jaataa hai
 Different types of minority communities do not get adequate representation in it
 teesri baat yah he ki yah pranali praaia: matadaataaon ke aise samudaayon ko jinhen thodaa hi adhik bahumat praapt he, sadan main bahut badha chadhaakar dikhaane main sahaayak ban jaati he
 The total number of votes a party receives in proportion to the total voting can be chosen more than the number of members of that party should be elected justly
 1952 ke bharat ke pratham aam chunaav main yahi hua tha
 Some political thinkers and politicians have suggested that the party whose consensus is to run the government should at least get the support of the majority of the total electorate
 isi lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhkar nirvachan pranali main kuch sudhaar sujhaaye gaye he
 The repealed secret voting system is one of these reforms
 sabase saral tarika vah he jiskaa prayog vidhaan sabhaaon dwaara kiye jane vaale chunaav main udaahranarth, america ke daleey sammelan dwaara raashtrapati evam uparashtrapati pad ke liye khadey hone vaale ummidavaaron ke chunaav main, kiya jaataa he
 a series of secret ballots continues through the Shalaka method until a candidate secures the highest number of votes out of all the votes cast
 'sarvaadhik matpraapt vyakti kii vijay kii pranali' praaia: sadaiv hi sabase bade dalon ke hi anukool or durbal evam alpsankhyak dalon ke pratikul hoti he
 Some methods have been suggested to overcome this trend without resorting to genetic representation, but the use of all these systems requires a multi-member constituency
 iske antargat pratham gupt matdaan main koi ummidavaar tabhi chunaa ja saktaa he jab vah pade hue samast maton main se ekantata sarvaadhik mat praapt kar le
 If this is not possible, some time is given for a refund
 france main iske liye ek saptaah yaa pandrah din kaa samay diya jaataa tha
 This is followed by a second secret ballot
 is matdaan main jis ummidavaar ko sarvaadhik mat praapt hote hai vah vijayi ho jaataa he
 In this way, the result of the election is ultimately determined by the method of victory of the person with the most votes
 france ke tritiy ganatantr ke samay yahi pranali vyavahrut hoti thi
 Obviously, this system cannot be used in large-scale elections such as elections to the Legislative Assembly in India
 prayek nirvaachak ummidavaaron ke naamon ke saamne mataptr par 1, 2, 3, aadi ank likhakar apni variyata ke kram kaa sanket kar detaa he
 First preferences are calculated first
 yadi is gananaa main do se adhik ummidavaar aaye to jis ummidavaar ko pratham variyata ke mat nunatam mili hote hai uskaa naam chunaav pratiyogita se hataa diya jaataa he
 The second preferences of the voters are then divided into the remaining suitable candidates or candidates
 is prakaar nirasan or kramik variyataon ke antaran kii prakriya tab tak chalati rahati he jab tak koi ummidavaar pade hue kul maton main se sarvaadhik mat praapt nahin kar letaa
 But it is one thing to vote repeatedly, taking the time to discuss each new situation arising as it would in a repealed secret ballot or second secret ballot system, and in relation to a selection result that is already well Can not be known, it is quite another to write a number on the ballot and express a hypothetical decision
 isamen puraa andeh bana rah jaataa he ki koi matadaata antim pratiyogita main pratyaksh chayan kii sthiti aane par bhi isi tarah "k" ke mukaable main "kha" ko hi variyata detaa
 This system is also known as the Brihatmik Matcha System
 ise sambhavat: sarvapratham 1770 main chevlier di borda ne prastaavit kiya tha
 In 1930, the Liverl party urged Britain to accept it as the highest
 austrailia main bhi kuch sangheey evam raji chunaavon main iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The simplest method is that only one ballot is given to each elector
 maan lijiye ki kisi nirvachan kshetra ko chaar sadsy chunane hai or kul 12 hajaar matadaata vot dete hai
 In such a situation, if a candidate gets the support of 2401 voters then his victory is certain
 vijay dilaane vaali sankhya kaa pataa is sutara se laga liya jaataa he- This formula was invented by Drupe, hence it is called Drupa Kota
 vyavhaar main sthiti yah he ki drupakota se kam mat praapt karne vaala ummidavaar bhi chun liya ja saktaa he
 This system has been in use in Japan since 1900
 ise 1831 main pred ne prastaavit kiya tha
 It was used in Britain for some time after the Reform Act was formed in 1867, when a number of three-tier constituencies were made in the big cities by the said Act
 prayek matadaata ko teen jagahon ke liye keval do vot diye gaye the
 The practical effect of this system was that in order to divide the representation, the parties started bargaining and losing candidates who had no chance of victory
 yah pranali 1953 main prakaash main aayi
 In this, the voter is given as many votes as possible in the constituency and he has the freedom to vote all his votes in favor of one candidate or distribute to other candidates as he wishes
 is pranali main matadaataaon ko adhik mahatv praapt ho jaataa he
 Sometimes the representation of minorities is achieved by a separate electoral system
 angreji shasankaal main bharat main yahi kiya gaya tha
 The Muslim people chose their representatives separately from the Hindus
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki alpsankhyakon ke liye kuch jagahen surakshit kar di jaaain jaisaa ki bharat main pariganit jatiyon evam kabilo ke liye kiya gaya he
 The victory system of the most voted person is generally followed in a single-member constituency, while the proportional representation system requires multi-member constituencies
 ek hi jagah anupatik rup main vibhajit nahin kii ja sakati
 In a constituency, seats are determined only in proportion to the votes cast for each candidate or for the party that fielded the candidates
 anupatak pratinidhitiv mukhyat: do prakaar ke hote hai : Both of these types also have many forms
 inhen ek duusare se bhi mila diya ja saktaa he athwa "fasrt past da post pranali main bhi inkaa mishran kiya ja saktaa he
 " is pranali kaa avishkaar europe main aadhunik daleey sanghatan ke vikaas ke purv hi ho chukaa tha
 It was only in the late 19th century that the demand for universal suffrage began to come in full swing
 is maang kaa pratirodh nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 But politicians were skeptical of the "tyranny of the majority"
 ve alpsankhyakon kii tathaa unke hiton kii raksha karnaa chaahate the
 For this purpose, in 1857, the liberal Danish politician C
G
 Barrister Thomas Herr of Andras and London invented this system
 is pranali ko khyaati mili kyonki british udaarataavaad ke bauddhik netaa jon stuart mil ne is pranali ko sweekaar kar liya or 1861 main prakashit apane prasiddh granth "ripregentative government" main isapar vichaar kiya
 Regardless of the number of seats, the voter gets only one vote under this system
 vah ummidavaar ke naam ke aage 1, 2, 3, 4 aadi ank likhakar vibhinn ummidavaaron ke prati apni variyata kaa sanket karata hua apana vot de saktaa he
 It would be fine to illustrate this with an example
 maan lijie ki ek chaar sadasyon vaala nirvachankshetra he
 a total of 12 thousand votes were cast in it
 drup kota ke anusaar jise kam se kam 2401 pratham variyataon ke vot praapt ho jaaain uskaa nirvaachit ho janaa nishchit he
 Now suppose there are 9 candidates in the fray and only two of them get more votes than the drupe quota - one 2451 and the other 2481; The remaining votes are distributed among the remaining candidates
 pratham gananaa main ukt donon ummidavaar nirvaachit ghoshit kar die jate hai
 This will be followed by a second calculation
 dwitiya gananaa main nunatam vot praapt karanevaale ummidavaar ko maidan se hataa diya ja saktaa he or nirast pratyaashee kii dwitiya variyatayen tathaa donon vijayi pratyaashiyon ke atirikt mataptr shesh ummidavaaron ko hastantanrit kiye ja sakate hai
 The second way is to look at the second preferences of all their voters, counting the total votes received from each of the remaining candidates and dividing the total votes received by each
 is prakaar donon ummidavaaron main se jise bhi drup kota mil jaae use nirvaachit ghoshit kar diya jaae
 The counting of votes will continue like this until the candidates who receive the drup quota for all the seats are found
 iskaa uddeshy prayek vot ko ek mulya pradaan karnaa he
 The same system has been used for elections to the main representative assemblies in the republics of Ireland and Tasmania
 austrailia or new southwells ke dwitiya sadanon ke chunaav main bhi iskaa upyog hota he
 The same system is followed in the election of members of legislative councils in India as well
 anuparthik pratinidhitiv kaa yah doosraa prakaar he
 Under this, every voter is asked not to contest among the individual candidates and to make elections in the lists of candidates which have been submitted by different parties or organizations
 belgium main 1899 main yahi tarika apanaaya gaya tha
 This method is also prevalent in Holland Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, France, West Germany and Italy
 is pranali ke vibhinn rup hote hai
 Two major forms are being considered here
 inamen se ek ko "sarvocch ausat dwaara anupatik pratinidhitiv" kehete hai
 This was originated by d "hant of Belgium", which is why it is also called D, Hant's law
 siton kaa batwaaraa ek-ek karke hota he
 If a candidate gets the respective seat, then every candidate who gets the highest average ballot for each seat gets a place in the list
 is parinaam ko praapt karne kaa sutara yah he ki prayek vinidhaan ke avasar par prayek suchi ke kul aarambhik vot tab tak praapt siton kii sankhya se ek adhik dwaara vibhakt kar die jate hai
 There is a denominator for each list at the time of first allocation
 or isi kaaran soochiyon ke aarambhik vot hi ausat hote hai
 The denominator of the winning list at the time of the second allocation will be 2 while the remainder of the remainder remains 1
 isi tarah tisare or chauthe vinidhaan ke samay bhi siton kaa bantwaaraa kiya jaataa he
 The second method is called proportional representation by "greatest balance"
 isamen nirvachanlabdhi kaa hisaab pade hue kul voton kii sankhya ko niyat siton kii sankhya se vibhajit karke laga liya jaataa he
 Then each list is given as many places as the above mentioned number in each list
 yadi iske baad bhi kuch siten batch jaati hon to unka vinidhaan prayek suchi ke aanrabhik voton se un voton ko, jinka labdhi dwaara kisi ek yaa anek siton ko praapt karne main vah upyog kar chuki he, nikaalkar bache hue voton kii sankhya ke vistaar ke anusaar aanukramik gati se kar diya jaataa he

 Sleeping Beauty is the classic fairy tale of a beautiful princess and a banquet princess
 yah charles perulat dwaara 1697 main contes di maa meri ioe kii prakashit set kii pehali kahani he
 Although Perrault's version is quite well-known, an earlier version of the legend called "sun, Moon and Tallia", published in Giambattista Basil's Pentamaron, was published in 1634
 angreji bhashi duniya kii sabase parichit 'sleeping beauty ' par 1959 walt digni anemated film bani, jisamen shychovski ke baile se bhi utana hi liya gaya he jitna ki perult se
 The basic element of Perrault's narrative is divided into two parts
 kuch lok kathakaron kaa maananaa he ki ve asal main alag-alag kathaayen thim, jaisaa ki ve baad main grimes ke sanskaran main bane hai or unhen besil ne tathaa baad main unke anukaran main perult ne jod diya
 On completion of the long-cherished wish, the fairies invited as godmother on the naming ritual of the shehzadi gave her gifts such as beauty, intelligence and musical talent
 haalanki unamem se andekhi ho gayi ek dusht pari ne apane uphaar ke rup main shahzaadi ko yah kehete hue ek jaadu ke adheen rakhaa ki yuva hone par shahzaadi kii ungali ek takali main chubh jaaegi tathaa vah mar jaaegi
 unamem se ek nek pari us jaadu kaa asar puri tarah se to nahin hataa pai lekin usne kaha ki marane kii bajaay shahzaadi sau saalon tak soti rahegi, tab tak jab tak ki uskaa sachcha pyaar tathaa ek shahjada chuum kar use jagaa na de
 The emperor prohibited his entire kingdom from cutting or stitching the spinning wheel or keeping it, while pronouncing the death penalty, but all proved to be futile
 jab shahzadi pandrah yaa solah saal kii thim, to vah mahal ke durg par ek buzurg mahila se mili jo katai kar rahi thi
 Shehzadi expressed her desire to try this unique work and destiny played its game
 dusht pari kaa shaap puraa hua
 The noble fairy returned and threw all the people of the palace into a sleepy fire
 mahal ko contili jhaadiyon se bhare jangal se gherte hue ise bahari duniya kii ankhon se ojhal kar diya gaya taaki iske andar ghuspaith karne kii koshish karne vaale ko pehle kaanton kaa shikaar hokar maut ko gale lagaana pade
 When a hundred years passed, a princess who had heard about this magic showed the jauhar to rip off that forest
 As he progressed, the road became self-contained and thus he entered the palace
 vah shahzaadi kii khubsuurati dekh kar mantra-mugdh ho gaya tathaa uske saamne apane ghutanon ke bal baith gaya
 He kissed her and she woke up and then broke the sleep of all the people of the palace and they started from where everyone had left

 After being secretly married by a sleepy royal donor, Shehzada continued to meet John Shehzadi, who gave her two children, Laureor and Lee George
 is baat ko usne apni rakshas vansh kii maa se chupaaye rakhaa
 When he ascended the throne, he brought his wife and children to the capital and left them in the coronation of his queen mother and went to war with the neighboring king Kantalabutte himself
 rakshasi maa ne yuva rani or uske bacchon ko jangal ke ek ekant ghar main bhej diya or apane rasoiye ko raat ke khaane ke liye ladke ko sos ke saath taiyaar rakhane ko kaha
 aadamzaat rasoiye ne ladke kii jagah ek bhed paros di jisase rani maa santusht ho gayi
 She then asked for the girl, but was delighted with the fresh goat made with the same delicious sauce
 jab rakshasi ne yuva rani ko parose jane kii maang kii to rasoiye ne uske galaa kaatane kii peshkash kii, taaki vah apane bacchon ke paas ja sake jinhen rakshasi ab mara hua samaj rahi thi
 Everyone's tearful reunion took place in the cook's small house, while the Queen Mother was happy with the hind served with sauce Robert

 After that everyone started laughing

 The mother-in-law's envy is not as inspiring, although it is common in fairy tales
 madhyayugin sabhy romance perseforest ke kuch purvavarti tatwon ne is katha main yogadan diya he, jisamen jelandine naamak ek shahzaadi troylos naamak yuvak se pyaar kar baithti he
 His father sends the young man to do some work to prove himself worthy of the girl, and when he is gone, Gelandine is lost in a sleep of magic
 troylos use dhund nikaalata he or use neend main hi garbhvatee bana detaa he; jab unka baccha paidaa hota he to vah uski ungali se san nikaal detaa he jisaki vajah se vah neend main khoyi thi
 She recognizes that he is the father of the child by the ring worn by Troyloss in his finger, and he returns from his adventurous work to marry her
 purvavarti prabhaav walsanga saaga kii nidramagn brinhild kii kahani tathaa purv isaai hegiography paramparaon kii punya mahila shaheedon se lee gai hai
 In fact, it was the existence of Breamhield that inspired the Grimm brothers to include this story in their next version rather than erasing it, as they did in their other works, which they were purely French in drawing inspiration from Perrault's works
 Believed kahani kaa uttararddh saint genevive se prabhavit ho saktaa he, jahaan shahzaadi or uske bacchon ko takreeban maar die jane kii taiyaari rahati he or unhen chupa diya jaataa he
 This fairytale is classified as the 410th type of arne-thompson
 shahzaadi kaa naam badalata rahaa he
 She is named Talia in Sun, Moon and Talia
 perult ne ise hataa diya or use benaam rahane diya, haalanki uske beti kaa naam "loror" rakhaa gaya
 The Grimm brothers named him "briar Rose" in their 1812 collection
 is sthanantaran ko dizani dwaara film ke liye liya gaya, jisamen use orora naam hi diya gaya
 John Stjean named him "rosebud" in Telestory presentations
 grim bhaaiyon ne apane sangrah main ek alag brir rose ko shaamil kiya
 As Perrault and Basil have said about its prevalent ending: the narrative ends with the arrival of the shehzade
 greem kii katha ke kuch anuwaadon main shahzaadi kaa naam rozamond rakhaa gaya he
 The brothers thought it appropriate to dismiss the story on the basis that it was taken from Perrault's version, but because of the presence of the Brinhild tale they agreed to include it as an actual German tale
 phir bhi, yah katha kii ekmaatr prachlit german style he or perult kaa prabhaav lagbhag tay he
 The Grimm brothers also included a fragmented fairytale called The Evil mother-in-law in the first edition of their stories
 isaki shuruyaat perult kii kathaon kii tarah shaadishuda nayika tathaa do bacchon kii maa se hoti he tathaa uski saas pehle uske bacchon ko tathaa baad main nayika ko khaane kii koshish karti he
 Contrary to Perrault's version, the heroine here suggests serving an animal instead of them in the dish itself, and this section ends with the heroine worrying that her children cry and their voices fall into the mother-in-law's ears
 Can not stop with
 Like many German tales showing French influence, it did not appear in any later version

 They maintain that the woman who tried to kill the children was the king's mother, not his wife, but added to it that she did not want to eat them herself but wanted to serve them to the king
 unka yah sanskaran kailabria se liya gaya tha lekin unhone yah kaha ki sabhi italvi sanskaran besil kaa qareeb se anukaran karte hai
 In addition to Sun, Moon and Talia, Basil added The Young Slave, another genre of the arne-thompson type
 grim bhaaiyon ne bhi ek duusare tathaa adhik duurastha sambandh vaale da glass coffin kaa samavesh kiya
 Joseph Jakob stated that Sleeping Beauty had a similar physique in this tale and in a Gypsy tale called The King of England and His Three Sons in his More English Fairy Tales book
 raja kii maa kii uski nav vivaahita patni ke saath dushmani pari katha da sicks swance main bhi doharaai gai he tathaa ise da tvilv wild ducks main bhi dikhaaya gaya he jahaan use raja kii sauteli maa kaa rup diya gaya he, lekin in kathaon main uske rakshasipan ko mitaa diya gaya he
 Some folklorists have described Sleeping Beauty as an indicator of the replacement of the lunar year by the solar year
 baharhaal, yah is baat ko darshata he ki keval grim bhaaiyon kii katha main dusht pari terahavin pari thi or perult kii katha main vah aathvin thi
 Among familiar themes and elements in Perrault's narrative: sleeping beauty bahut si pari kathaon ko dohraane ke liye prachlit rahi he
 These include Mercedes Lackey's Elemental Masters novel The Gates of Sleep; Robin mckinley's Spindles End, Aurora Scott Card's Enchantment, Jane Youlene's Briar Rose, Sophie Masson's Clementine, and Ann Rice's Sleeping Beauty Triology
 pari maa ke shaap ko hoobahoo katha se lekar bahuterey sandarbhon main istemaal kiya gaya he
 George macdonald used it in his Sleeping Beauty parody The Light Princess, in which the evil fairy mother curses the shehzadi not to die, but to lose gravity - leading to the loss of body weight as well as the seriousness of others' suffering It is also unable to take from

 The length of this cave is 19 meters and width is 16 meters
 gupha 11 meter unchi he
 The Amarnath cave is one of the major shrines of Lord Shiva
 amarnath ko tirthon kaa tirth kaha jaataa he kyon ki yaheen par bhagwaan shiv ne maan parvati ko amartv kaa rahasy bataaya tha
 The main feature of this place is the formation of natural Shivling in the cave in the snow
 prakritik him se nirmit hone ke kaaran ise swayambhu himani shivlinga bhi kehete hai
 Starting from Ashada Purnima till Rakshabandhan, lakhs of people come here for the holy Himling Darshan to be held throughout the month of Sawan
 gupha kii paridhi lagbhag dedh sau foot he or isamen upar se barf ke pani kii boonden jagah-jagah tapakati rahati hai
 There is a place here, in which a ten feet long Shivling is formed by dripping snow droplets
 chandramaa ke ghatane-badhane ke saath-saath is barf kaa aakaar bhi ghatata-badhata rahata he
 On Shravan Purnima it comes in its full size and gradually becomes smaller till Amavasya
 aashcharya kii baat yahi he ki yah shivlinga thos barf kaa bana hota he, jabaki gupha main aamtaur par kachi barf hi hoti he jo haath main lete hi bhurabhura jaae
 Ganesh, Bhairav and Parvati have similar icebergs several feet away from the original Amarnath Shivling
 janashruti prachlit he ki isi gupha main mata parvati ko bhagwaan shiv ne amarkatha sunai thi, jise sunakar sadyojaat shuk-shishu shukdev rishi ke rup main amar ho gayi the
 Even today, a pair of pigeons are seen in the cave, which the devotees call immortal birds
 ve bhi amarkatha sunakar amar hue hai
 There is also a belief that Shiva Parvati, who sees devotees who are associated with pigeons, provides salvation to that creature by taking a direct view of their visions
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv ne adrdhagini parvati ko is gupha main ek aisi katha sunai thi, jisamen amarnath kii yatra or uske maarg main aane vaale anek sthalon kaa varnan tha
 This story later became known as Amarkatha
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki bhagwaan shankar jab parvati ko amar katha sunaane le ja rahe the, to unhone chote-chote anant naagon ko anantnag main choda, maathe ke chandan ko chandanbari main utaara, anya pissuon ko pissu top par or gale ke sheshnag ko sheshnag naamak sthal par choda tha
 All these places still visit the Amarnath Yatra

 Even today a fourth offering is made to the descendants of that Muslim shepherd

 While proceeding on the path of the river Amravati, many other small and large caves are seen
 ve sabhi barf se dhaki hai
 There are two ways to go on Amar Nath Yatra

 That is, to reach Pahalman and Baltal by any ride, you have to use your feet to go further from here
 ashakt yaa vridhon ke liye savaariyon kaa prabandh kiya ja saktaa he
 The route from Pahalgam is considered to be simple and convenient
 baltaal se amarnath gupha kii duuri keval 14 kilometre he or yah bahut hi durgam rasta he or suraksha kii drushti se bhi sandigdh he
 That is why the government does not consider this route safe and motivates most of the travelers to go to Amarnath via Pahalgam
 lekin romaanch or jokhim lene kaa shauk rakhane vaale log is maarg se yatra karnaa pasand karte hai
 People traveling through this route travel at their own risk
 raste main kisi anhoni ke liye bharat sarkaar jimmedaari nahin leti he

 Pilgrims stay here for the night and start the third day journey from here
 sheshnag se panchatarani aath mile ke faasale par he
 The route has to cross the Beauvel Top and Mahagunas Pass, which are 13,500 feet and 14,500 feet in height respectively

 This place is named Panchtarni due to five small streams flowing here
 yah sthaan chaaron taraf se pahaado kii oonchi-oonchi chotiyon se dhakaa he
 The cold is also more due to the height

 Amarnath's cave remains only eight kilometers away from here and snow remains frozen on the way
 isi din gupha ke najadik pahunch kar padaav daal raat bitaa sakate hai or duusare din subah puja archana kar panchatarani lautaa ja saktaa he
 Some travelers reach Sheshnag by evening

 Pilgrims from the Baltal Camp can return to the camp in one day after visiting the Amarnath cave

 yah pustak karnataka ke kodawa samudaay kaa nritatvashastreey adhyayan thi
 Srinivas wrote in the book: "the caste system is far from a rigid system in which the position of each component caste is fixed for all time
 Movement has always been possible, and especially in the middle regions of the hierarchy
 a caste was able, in a generation or two, to rise to a higher position in the hierarchy by adopting vegetarianism and teetotalism, and by Sanskritizing its ritual and pantheon
 In short, it took over, as far as possible, the customs, rites, and beliefs of the Brahmins, and adoption of the Brahminic way of life by a low caste seems to have been frequent, though theoretically forbidden
 This process has been called 'sanskritization' in this book, in preference to 'brahminization', as certain Vedic rites are confined to the Brahmins and the two other 'twice-born' castes
" This book then challenged the ongoing idea that caste is a firm and unchanging institution

 lagbhag 700 isvi ke aasapaas isamen rachanaaen kii jane lagi
 Vidyapati is the author of Maithili and the most learned poet
 vidyapati ne maithili ke atirikt sanskrit tathaa avahtt main bhi rachanaaen likhin
 These are the two major languages from which Maithili developed
 bharat kii lagbhag 5
6 pratishat aabaadi lagbhag 7-8 karod log maithili ko matra-bhashaa ke rup main prayog karte hai or iske prayogkarta bharat or nepal ke vibhinn hisson sahit vishwa ke kai deshon main faile hai
 Maithili is considered one of the world's most prosperous, gentle and sweet languages
 maithili bharat main ek rajbhasha ke rup main sammanit he
 Maithili has its own script which is the first identity of a rich language
 nepal ho yaa bharat kahi bhi sarkaar ke dwaara maithili bhashaa ke vikaas hetu koi khaas kadam nahin uthaaya gaya he
 Now there is some effort to develop Maithili by NGO and media
 abhi 15 / 20 radio stesan aise he jisamen maithili bhashaa main kaarykram prasaarit kiya jaataa he
 Whether it is news or drama arts and intergovernmental work is also taking place in Maithili
 kisi kisi radio main to 50% se adhik kaarykram maithili main ho rahaa he
 It has been developing for the last 2 / 3 years

 It is also important financially because bees make honey from it
 phool ke alaava yah paudhe ke anya bhaagon jaise pattiyon tathaa floem utakon main bhi nirmit hote hai
 Some insect-eating parasitic plants use it to attract insect moths
 paraag kaa upyog paragan main hota he
 The mechanism of pollination by the plant depends on how pollination is used
 adhikansh phool apane paragan ke tareeke ko lekar mote taur par do samoohon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai
 Insect flowers: Flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another
 unka roopakar vishisht hota he or punkesar kii aisi vyavastha hoti he ki paraag ke dane apane aap pakshiyon yaa kitpatangon ke saath chipakkar sthaanantarit ho jaayen or jab vah duusare paudhon par baithe tab vahaan sthanantirit ho jaaen
 To get an attractive feature of the same species of multiple flowers, the pollinator transfers the pollen to the stigma in all those flowers that are arranged in exactly the same way
 kai phool paragan ke liye maatr phulon ke hisson ke bich nikatataa par nirbhar karte hai, jaise sarasenia yaa maadaa sleeper orchid
 Aerated flowers: Pollen is transported from one flower to the next with wind for example the Santi tree, the Ambergia rag grass and the Acer tree and shrubs
 unhen paragan ko aakarshith karne kii zarurat nahi padati jis kaaran unki pravriti 'dikhaawati phulon' kii nahi hoti
 jahaan kitprageeya phulon ke paraag bade or lasalase daanon ke rup main hote hai or protein kii adhiktawaale hote hai vahiin vaataparagit phulon ke paraag zyaadaatar chote dane liye hue rahete hai, bahut halke or kiton ke liye itane poshak bhi nahi hote
 Bees and bumble bees actively accumulate aerated pollen particles, although they are not of much importance
 kuch phool swaparagit hote hai or un phulon kaa istemaal karte hai jo kabhi nahi khilte, yaa phool khilne se pehle swaparagit jo jate hai, in phulon ko clisotogamas kaha jaataa he kai prakaar ke viola or salvia prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai

 The development of the quantum field theory unnecessarily explains the Kotar principle, even in some books it has been justified
 diraaq sameekaran ko hal karne par hamen rinatmak urja kii kwantum avasthaa praapt hoti he
 As a result, an electron can radiate its energy and achieve a negative energy state
 yadi ek kan or prati-kan yathochit kwantum avasthaa main hai to wo donon ek duusare ko vilupt karke koi anya kan kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 The reaction e- + e + → γ + γ is an example

 In other words, particles and antimatter yah anubhag kwantum kshetra siddhanth ke vihit pramaatrikaran ke sanket-chihn, bhashaa or suzav par aadhaarit he
 When we quantify electrons without deletion and precipitating operators jahaan kwantum sankhya p or σ kaa dyotak k he or urja ko E, vilopan sankaarak ko ak se pradarshit kiya gaya he
 When we talk of fermions the operator must follow the permutation property per se, however, the Hamiltonian can be written as follows lekin yahan h pratyaashit maan kaa dhanatmak hona aavashyak nahin he kyonki "E" kaa maan dhanatmak or rinatmak kuch bhi ho saktaa he or creation tathaa vilopan sankarkon ke sangyojan kaa pratyaashit maan 1 or 0 ho saktaa he Therefore, we have to propose a counter-particle whose creation and deletion operators satisfy the following relation
 jahaan abhinn p va viparit σ or urja ke viparit chihn dyotak k he
 Then we can rewrite it jahaan pratham yoga dhanatmak urja avasthaaon va dwitiya yoga rinatmak urja avasthaaon ke liye he

 Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the king of the Sikh Empire
 ve sher-e punjab ke naam se prasiddh hai
 Maharaja Ranjit was a man who not only kept Punjab united as a powerful province, but also did not allow the British to wander around his empire
 ranjit singh kaa janm san 1780 main gujranvala sandhawalia jat maharaja mahaan singh ke ghar hua tha
 In those days, Punjab was ruled by Sikhs and Afghans, who divided the whole area into many examples
 ranjit ke pita maha singh sukarchakia misal ke commander the
 Located in western Punjab, the area was headquartered in Gujranwala
 choti si umr main chechak kii vajah se maharaja ranjit singh kii ek aankh kii roshni jaati rahi
 It was only 12 years old when his father passed away and the entire burden of the Rajpat fell on his shoulders
 12 april 1801 ko ranjit ne maharaja kii oopaadhi grahan kii
 He was crowned by a descendant of Guru Nanak
 unhone lahore ko apni rajdhani banaaya or san 1802 main amritsar kii ore ruukh kiya
 Maharaja Ranjit fought many battles against the Afghans and drove them towards West Punjab
 ab peshawar samet pashtun kshetra par unheen kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 This was the first time Pashtuns were ruled by a non-muslim
 uske baad unhone peshawar, jammu kashmir or anandpur par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 He is also credited with forming the first modern Indian Army - the "sikh Khalsa Army"
 unki saraparasti main punjab ab bahut shaktishaalee suba tha
 This powerful army kept Britain from grabbing Punjab for a long time
 ek aisa mauka bhi aayaa jab punjab hi ekmaatr aisa suba tha, jis par angrejon kaa kabja nahin tha
 According to British historian JT Wheeler, if he had been a generation older, he would have conquered the whole of India
 maharaja ranjit khud anpadh the, lekin unhone apane rajya main shiksha or kala ko bahut protsaahan diya
 He established law and order in Punjab and never gave death penalty to anyone
 unka suba dharmanirpeksh tha unhone hinduon or sikhon se vasule jane vaale jajia par bhi roak lagaai
 Never forced anyone to adopt Sikhism
 unhone amritsar ke harimandir sahib gurudware main sangemarmar lagavaaya or sona madhvaaya, tabhi se use swarna mandir kaha jane laga
 The prized diamond Kohinoor was a treasure trove of Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 san 1839 main maharaja ranjit kaa nidhan ho gaya
 His mausoleum was built in Lahore, which still remains there
 unki maut ke saath hi angrejon kaa punjab par shikanja kasnaa shuru ho gaya
 After the british-sikh War, Punjab was made part of the British Empire on 30 March 1849 and the Kohinoor was introduced at Huzur in Queen Victoria
 ranjitsingh kaa janm san 1780 i
 main hua tha
 He was a proud king of the society, Ranjitsingh became the leader of Misl Sukrachakia at the age of twelve after the death of Mahan Singh
 san 1798 i
 main jamaan shah ke punjab se laut jane par unhone lahore par adhikaar kar liya
 Gradually, from the Sutlej to the Indus, he controlled all the Muslims who were ruling
 satluj or yamuna ke bich phulakiyon misl ke shaasha rajya kar rahe the
 In 1806 AD, Ranjitsingh also tried to subdue them, but was not successful
 ranjitsingh main sainik netritv ke bahut saare gun the
 He was a visionary
 ve saanwale rang kaa nate kad ke manushya the
 One of his eyes was lost due to Sheetla's wrath
 parantu yah hote hue bhi vah tejasvi the
 So as long as he was alive, all the missiles were buried
 us samay angrejon kaa rajya yamuna tak pahunch gaya tha or phulakiyaan misl ke raja angreji rajya ke prabhutv ko maanane lage the
 The British forbade Ranjitsingh from doing this
 ranjitsingh ne angrejon se ladanaa uchit na samajha or sandhi kar lee ki satluj ke aage ham apana rajya na badhayenge
 Ranjitsingh summoned the French troops, prepared his army in a military manner, in his military command
 ab unne punjab ke dakshini, pashchimi or uttari bhaagon par akraman karnaa prarambh kiya or das varsh main multan, peshawar or kashmir tak apane rajya ko badha liya
 Ranjitsinh had captured Peshawar in his possession, but he had to fight hard for many years to take full authority over that province
 vah puure punjab kaa swami ban chukaa; or use angrejon ke hastkshep kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 But at the time when the British asked for help from the Sikhs against the Napoleonic forces, they did not receive it
 ranjitsingh ne san 1808 i
 main apni mahatvakankshini saas sadakor ke naam peshawar kaa rajya parivartit kar diya tha
 Because it was a British agent woman
 ranjitsingh ne apni kuchakrapriy saas se jhagada karke use kaid kar liya tha or hvadani ke garh ko apane adhikaar main kar liya tha
 a contingent of the British army rescued the captive widow Sadakaur and recovered the authority
 british sena ke saath ranjitsingh kisi prakaar kaa jhagada nahin chaahate the
 The British could be accused of breaching the terms of the treaty
 isliye chupchaap maun rahakar usne taiyaariyaan prarambh kii thim phir bhi 1809 i
 main lard minto se sandhi kar lee
 However, this treaty caused the Maharaja to be greatly humiliated among the Sikhs
 uparyukt sandhi ke kaaran punjab ke afgani rajya tathaa afghanistan ko kuch had tak aantkit kar sake the
 In 1802, 1806 and 1810 AD, conquered Multan and took possession and made a treaty with Shah Shuja and kept it there and obtained a 'cohenoor diamond' for a glass of water from it
 1811 i
 main kabul ke shah mahmud ke akraman kii baat sunakar or yah jaankaar ki mahmud kaa iraadaa kashmir ke shaasha par akraman kaa he, usne kashmir par akraman kar diya taaki mahmud ko waapas janaa sambhav ho jaae or uski mitrataa bhi ise mil jaae
 After Kashmir it marched on Peshawar in 1822, Yarmuhammad Khan fought bravely leading the Afghans but was defeated in the end
 is yuddh main sikhon kaa bhi bada nuksaan hua
 Fearing Ranjitsingh's authority over Peshawar in 1838, Dost Mohammad Khan Kabulnaresh became very frightened and befriended Russia and Iran
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar angrejon ne swayan ranjitsingh tathaa shahshuja ke saath ek trigutsandhi karai
 Maharaja Ranjitsingh was becoming unwell
 1838 main lakva kaa akraman hua, yadhyapi upachaar kiya gaya or angrej doctoron ne bhi ilaaj kiya, lekin 27 june 1839 i

 He set aside a property worth Rs 47 lakh for charity
 jagannathamandir par bhi vah kohenur hira chadhaanaa chahta tha lekin us heere ko to videsh main jaakar chhin-bhinn hona tha
 After the Maharaja, the Sikh state disappeared due to the inability of the Sikhs to respond to mutual disharmony, treason and English diplomacy
 baat san 1812 kii he
 Punjab was ruled by Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 us samay maharaja ranjit singh ne kashmir ke soobedaar atamohammad ke shikanje se kashmir ko mukt karaane kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 Fearful of this campaign, Atma Mohammed left Kashmir
 kashmir abhiyaan ke peeche ek anya kaaran bhi tha
 Shahshuja, who was defeated by Mahmud Shah by Atamohammad, was imprisoned in the fort of Shergarh
 use kaidakhane se mukt karaane ke liye uski begum vafa begum ne lahore aakar maharaja ranjit singh se prarthana kii or kaha ki meharbaani kar aap mere pati ko atamohammad kii kaid se reeha karvaa den, is ahsaan ke badale beshkeemtee kohinoor hira aapako bhent kar duungi
 After Shahshuja was imprisoned, Wafa Begum was the ruler of Afghanistan in those days

 Zaman Shah was the son of Ahmad Shah Abdali's son Timur Shah, whose brother was Mahmud Shah
 astu, maharaja ranjaiti singh swayan chaahate the ki ve kashmir ko atamohammad se mukt karavaaen
 Therefore, upon coming to Suyog, Maharaja Ranjit Singh liberated Kashmir
 unke dewan mohakamchand ne shergarh ke kile ko gher kar vafa begum ke pati shahshuja ko reeha kar vafa begum ke paas lahore pahunchaa diya
 Rajkumar Kharagsingh accommodated them in Mubarak Haveli
 par vafa begum apane vaade ke anusaar kohinoor hira maharaja ranjit singh ko bhent karne main vilamb karti rahi
 Even several months passed
 jab maharaja ne shahshuja se kohinoor heere ke bare main poocha to vah or uski begum donon hi bahaane banane lage
 When more emphasis was given, he handed over a fake diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, which proved to be a fake test of jewelers
 ranjit singh krodh se bhar uthe or mubarak haveli gher lee gai
 Food was not served there for two days
 varsh 1813 kii pehali june thi jab maharaja ranjit singh shahshuja ke paas aae or phir kohinoor ke vishay main poocha
 Shattered Shahshuja hid Kohinoor in his turban
 kisi tarah maharaja ko iskaa pataa chal gaya
 Hence, he pledged to put Shahshuja on the throne of Kabul by placing his hand on "gurugranth Sahib"
 phir use "pagadi-badal bhai" banane ke liye usase pagadi badal kar kohinoor praapt kar liya
 Wafa Begum, sitting in the curtain of the curtain, understood the prudence of the Maharaja
 ab kohinoor maharaja ranjit singh ke paas pahunch gaya tha or ve santusht the ki unhone kashmir ko aaazaad kara liya tha
 He wished to offer the Kohinoor diamond to the iconic Lord Jagannath in the temple of Jagannathpuri

 He also offered immense gold at the Vishwanath temple in Kashi
 parantu jagannatha bhagwaan tak pahunchane kii unki ichha koshadhyaksh beliram kii kuniti ke kaaran puri na ho saki
 After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the British attacked the Sikhs in 1845
 ferozepur kshetra main sikh sena veertapurvak angrejon kaa muqabla kar rahi thi
 But the commander of the Sikh army, Lalsingh, betrayed and left the front and fled to Lahore
 is kaaran vijay ke nikat pahunchakar bhi sikh sena haar gai
 The British took the Kohinoor diamond from the Sikhs

 Chandaram is a village in Adilabadu district under the state of Andhra Pradesh, India, in Manda Division
 girte hue yaa behate hue jal kii urja se jo vidyut utpann kii jaati he use jalavidyut kehete hai
 In 2005, around 816 gwe of hydroelectric power was generated worldwide, which is about 20% of the total electric power of the world
 yah bijli pradooshan rahit he
 And it is environmentally friendly
 bharat main vidyaman aarthik rup se dohan yogya tathaa arthksham jal sambhavyata 66 pratishat bhaar kaarak par 84,000 megawatt aanklit kii gai he 
 In addition, 6780 MW of installed capacity has been estimated from small, small and micro hydropower schemes
 94,000 megawatt kii sanchit sthapit kshamta ke saath pump kii gai bhandaran yojanaon hetu 56 sthalon kii bhi pahchaan kii gai he
 However, so far only 19
9% of this potential has been exploited
 vidyut, jal se utpann jal se praapt kii gai vidyutshakti ko jalavidyut kehete hai
 Hydropower is very important in the methods of generating electric power
 vishwa kii sampurna vidyut shakti kaa ek tihaai bhaag jalavidyut ke rup main praapt hota he
 Thus, the available energy in any form can be used for generation of electric power
 jalprapaat main girte hue pani main nihit urja kaa upyog pracheen kaal se hi panchakki ko chalaane main kiya jaataa rahaa he, parantu is urja kaa vidyutshakti ke liye upyog beesvin shatabdi kii hi dein he
 Not only can the energy contained in falling water be used for power generation, but the kinetic energy contained in flowing water can also be used for power generation
 iske liye sabase pehle aise sthaan kaa chunaav karnaa hota he, jahaan band baandhakar prachur maatra main pani jamaa kiya ja sake or usamen nihit shakti ko vidyut shakti ke janan ke liye jal ko aavashyaktaanusaar nalon athwa khuli nahar ke dwaara bijligharon main prayukt kiya ja sake
 Both rain and land have to be studied to find the suitable place
 band aisi jagah banaaya jaataa he jahaan nunatam mulya main bana band adhiktam pani jamaa kar sake
 For this the natural condition of the place should be such that a river passes through a narrow path between the mountains passing through the valley, so that the dam can be converted into a large reservoir by making a dam at the narrowest place
 band ke upar ek or agratal banaaya jaataa he, jahaan se pani khuli nahar athwa nalon dwaara bijlighar tak le jaaya jaataa he
 This water drives large turbines located in the power plant, generating electric power in the planned generators
 tarabine, cement kancreet ke bane drafttub ke mukh par avasthit hota he
 The water rotates the blades of the turbine as it occurs in the guide vane and thus uses its inherent energy to drive the turbine
 chalate hue tarabine kii yantric urja vidyut urja main roopantarit kar di jaati he or is prakaar jal main nihit urja jalavidyut kaa rup le leti he
 After the turbine thus uses the power contained in the water, the water passes through the draft-tube to the immersion pool, from where it then flows back into the river
 draft-tub kii banaavat aisi hoti he ki pani kii shesh urja dhire dhire samaapt ho jaae, jisase baahar aane par nadi ke kinaaron ko kshatigrast na kare
 The energy contained in water depends on its volume and top
 sheersh ke anuroop jalavidyut yojanaon ko teen bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he : 1
 High top plan - more than about 200 meters
 2
 madhyam sheersh yojana - 50 meter se 200 meter tak
 3
 Low top plan - less than 50 meters
 yojana kaa aakaar evam praroop donon hi sheersh ke upar nirbhar karata he or usee ke anusaar uske tarabinon kaa praroop bhi
 Thus Francis turbine and paston cycles are suitable for high head
 madhyam sheersh ke liye shravak pravaahvale daab tarabine prayukt kiye jate hai
 Propellant type turbine is more suitable for lower head
 ucch sheershawali yojanaon main, saadharantaya, pani kaa aaytan adhik nahin hota
 Therefore, water is transported by taps to the runner's vaults from the turbine pool, enabling the energy contained in the water to drive the runner
 tund dwaara pani ke pawah or gati kaa niyantran karne se tathaa baltiyon par chode janevaale pani ke kone kaa vicharan karne se tarabine ke nirgat kaa niyantran kiya ja saktaa he or is tarah janit honevaali vidyutshakti kaa bhi niyantran ho saktaa he
 It is also possible to vary the angle of buckets and both controls can be done automatically
 nodak praroop ke tarabine ke ranor main keval teen yaa chaar pankh hi hote hai
 They are made of heavy steel
 kam sheershawali yojanaon main bahudhaa pani kaa aaytan bahut adhik hota he 
 Therefore, it is not possible to take water in the taps and use an open drain
 bhaar ke anuroop nirgat praapt karne ke liye tarabine main janevaale pani kii maatra kaa vicharan karnaa aavashyak hota he, jo dwaar khulaai dwaara sampadit kiya jaataa he
 These gate guides are like a crescent and their position controls the water
 baari hone ke kaaran ye dwaar dravchaalit daab dwaara pravartit kiye jate hai
 Just as the angle of the guide panes, or buckets, of the Pelton cycle is rotated, they can also be introduced automatically
 swat: chaalit vicharan sarvo motor dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It is a small motor that rotates the hydraulic pressure
 iskaa nivesh tarabine ke nirgat kaa hi ek ansh hota he, at: uske anusaar vicharan karata he
 Thus, the work done by this motor depends on the output of the turbine, which corresponds to the load on it, and automatically controls the guide nettle, or opened by it, by subtracting the hydraulic pressure
 Is, or arranges the angles of buckets
 nodak praroop kii tarabine main caplen praroop kaa tarabine mukhya he
 Its specialty is its strong and high efficiency
 isaki duusari visheshta yah he ki bhaar vicharan se dakshata par bahut kam prabhaav hota he, jiske kaaran vicharanshil bhaar ke liye yah tarabine bahut hi upyukt hota he
 In medium head plans, in general, a mixed turbine is more commonly used, but its selection depends more on the top of the head
 pani ko tarabine main le jane ke liye sthir guide len kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Its output is varied by the variance of its angle
 kam sheershawala tarabine, saadharantaya, khule shashift ke upar sthit hota he
 They are surrounded by a spiral type of casing, allowing water to be carried by a uniform guide guide
 ucch sheershawale tarabine main yah aavaran dhaatu kaa bana hota he
 Turbines can be both horizontal and vertical
 parantu saamanyat:, urdhwadhar hi adhik prayog main aata he
 These have specific types of bearings, which also have to bear the distinguished lateral shock on the machine
 isliye inhen aghat vering kehete hai
 Lubrication of bearings and other moving parts is also a difficult problem in itself
 iske liye daab snehan vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this, the lubricant oil is pressed and sent to the lubricating places
 tel pump dwaara daab utpann kii jaati he
 There is also a system of automatically shutting down the machine, so that it does not get damaged in such a situation
 snehak tel ko saaf karne ke liye ek tel filter hota he or snehan ke pashchaat garam ho janevaale tel kaa thandha karne ke liye tel sheetak kii bhi vyavastha rahati he
 His position is of paramount importance in hydroelectric schemes
 inaki sthiti, mukhyat:, prakritik evam bhautik kaarnon par nirbhar karti he
 Roughly 10 MW of power would be available if a hydroelectric scheme provided a top of 150 feet with a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second
 jalashay kaa anumaan bhi is aadhaar par lagaaya ja saktaa he, ki 1
13 varg mile ke kshetrafal main 1 foot pani keval 1 ghan foot prati second kaa pravaah utpann karata he
 Therefore, to get a flow of 1,000 cubic feet per second, the reservoir must have an average of 10 square feet of water over an area of 113 square miles
 kisi bhi jalavidyut yojana ko vyaavhaarik hone ke liye vah aavashyak he ki adhik se adhik sheersh evam pravaah ho
 Low-top schemes can only be practical when the flow of water is sufficient
 ucch sheershawali yojanaayen kam pravaah par bhi vyaavhaarik ho sakati he
 It is not mandatory for the power house to be near the dam
 jalashay pahaad par ho saktaa he or adhik sheersh paane ke liye bijlighar pahaad kii talahati main banaaya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, large tubes of water are transported to the power station
 ucch sheersh vaali yojanaayen saamanyat: isi praroop kii hoti hai
 In many places the water is transported to another power station in the hill by cutting the hill
 bijlighar kaa prithvital par hona bhi anivaary nahin
 Many power stations are also inside the earth and can be accessed only by lift
 mathan main bhi aisa hi bhumigat bijlighar banaaya gaya he
 Such power houses are of the automatic type and operated from the ground floor by remote control
 yadhyapi ye bijlighar mukhyat: prakritik kaarnon se hi prithvi ke andar banaae jate hai, tathaapi ye samrik drushtikon se surakshit hone ke kaaran bahut mahatvapurn hote hai
 There are many low-end schemes in our country
 ganga evam sharada naharon ke upar bahut se bijlighar banaae gaye hai, jinamein keval 20 se 30 foot ke sheersh kaa hi upyog kiya gaya he
 These schemes have become feasible due to high water flow
 jalavidyut yojanaayen, mukhyat:, norge, sweden, switsraland, germany, france, canada, rus evam america main hai
 India is also not far behind in hydroelectric schemes and some of the schemes here are counted among the world's greatest schemes, such as bhakra-nangal, Damodar Valley, Rihand, Hirakund, Nagarjuna Sagar, Koyna, Shivasamudram, Periyar etc
 bahut si jalavidyut yojanaayen bahuddeshiy bhi hoti hai
 These are mainly included with irrigation and flood prevention schemes, so that all-round development of the area can be done
 america main tennesi ghati nigam ke aadhaar par bharat main bhi damodar ghati nigam kii sthapana kii gai
 Many important hydroelectric schemes have been made in the last twenty years and plans are being made after studying the hydroelectric potential everywhere
 jalavidyut yojana main, yadhyapi, aarambh main bahut adhik vyay hota he, tathaapi tab bhi parichaalan vyay kam hone ke kaaran adhikansh yojanaayen aarthik drushtikon se safal hoti hai
 The life of their plant is also relatively much longer
 inkaa mukhya dosha vastav main inaki upabhokta sthanon se duuri he
 These plans cannot be made for wherever they are
 udaahranarth, yadi shakti kii maang kalkatte main he, to vahaan jalavidyut yojana karyanvit karnaa sambhav nahin
 The rivers originating from the Himalayas contain immense water power, but there is no demand for power
 is prakaar jalavidyut yojana dwaara janit vidyut shakti ko bahudhaa bahut duuri tak preshit karnaa hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to incur the expenditure of the remittance system for a comparative study of the hydroelectric scheme
 tab bhi adhikanshat: jalavidyut hi sasti padati he
 It is one of the famous mountain shrines of Hinduism
 yah prayag dhauli ganga tathaa alaknanda nadiyon ke sangam par vishnuprayag sthit he
 The ancient temple and the Vishnu Kund embellished with the statue of Lord Vishnu at the confluence are worth visiting
 yah sagar tal se 1372 me0 kii oonchai par sthit he
 Vishnu Prayag is located on the joshimath-badrinath motorway

 Maybe you do not know, then let us tell you that whenever we wear some Gemstones, there are cosmic energies which are cosmic forces that are in our body through Gemstones It keeps growing slowly
 Everyone should wear Gemstones according to planets
 Apart from planets, it is also important to know which metal should wear Gemstones
 In the Panchadhatu, wearing gemstones is considered very auspicious
 panchadhaatu pehanene ke phaayde 1
 Wearing Panchadhatu destroys all the negative energy around us
