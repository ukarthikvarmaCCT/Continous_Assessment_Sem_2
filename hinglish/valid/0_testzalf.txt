 Malik Ambar was probably born in 1549 into a Habshi family
 balykaal main hi use das banaakar baghdad ke bazaar main le jaakar khwaja pir baghdad ke haathon bechaa gaya
 Khwaja went with Malik Ambar to South India where he was bought by Nizamshah i minister Genghiz Khan
 malik ambar kii buddhi kushagra, prakruti pratibhayukta or udaar thi, at: use anya gulaamon kii apeksha khyaati paane main der na lagi
 He got an opportunity to understand Nizamshahi politics and military management while remaining under the patronage of Genghis Khan
 changez khan kii aakasmik mrityu hone ke kaaran vah kuch samay tak idhar-udhar nizaamshaahi rajya main thokaren khaataa rahaa
 Seeing the dark clouds enveloping the Nizamshahi kingdom, and fearing the pangs of persecution and the constant invasions of the Mughals, he went to Bijapur and Golconda, but when these states too did not get the proper opportunity, he along with other Habsis again went to Ahmednagar
 Returned vah sena main bharti hua or use amang khan ne 150 ashwarohiyon kaa sardaar niyukt kiya
 He reached Chunar with his refugee and started harassing the Mughal invaders
 shatru ke shiviron par chapa markar vah rasad lut letaa tha or uske pradesh main ghus padataa tha
 Thus gradually his fame began to grow
 parantu jab ahmednagar par mughalon kaa adhikaar ho gaya or nizaamshaahi rajya apni antim saansen le rahaa tha tab malik ambar ko apane adamya saahas, shakti evam gunon kaa parichay dene kaa avasar mila
 With the help of the Marathas, he created an army and installed a new capital in Parenda by placing a person named Ali of the Nizamshahi family on the throne
 hrasgrast rajya kaa pun: sanghathan karke or sukh shanti ke vaataavaran kaa pratipaadan karke usne ek naveen jagrati paidaa kar di
 The Nizamshahi kingdom was again oriented towards sovereignty and opulence
 paristhiti uske anukool thi
 Due to the sudden rebellion of Prince Salim, the withdrawal of the Mughal army from the south became mandatory
 falat: malik ambar ne mughalon dwaara vijay kiye hue pradeshon par apana adhikaar karnaa prarambh kar diya or ahmednagar, praaia: samast dakshin bhaag, hastgat kar liya
 But soon he faced another difficulty
 saadat khan ne, jo nizaamshaahi sardaar tha, mughalon kii adheenta sweekaar kar lee
 Seeing this, one of his followers took possession of his occupied territory and he started competing with the Mughals
 vah bhi parenda aayaa par anya nizaamshaahi sevakon main sammilit ho gaya
 But angry at not getting a promising post, he went back to his state and from there started instigating the Nizamshah against Ambar
 falswaroop, ambar or raju donon ek duusare ke shatru ho gaye
 But both continued to compete with the Mughals in their territories
 iske baavjood 1605 tak malik ambar kii paristhiti drudh hi hoti gai
 Removing the entire Mughal state from Ahmednagar, he left Paranda and built a new capital at Junnar
 raju ko parrast kar usne bandi bana liya or phir maut ke ghat utaar diya, tathaa uski jaagir par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 Taking on the Mughals, he chewed iron gram to the food hall
 apane senadhyaksh khanekhana kii asafalataa par jahangir ko krodh aayaa or iskaa kaaran jaanane ke hetu khanekhana ko darbar main bulaayaa gaya
 Arriving in Agra, Khankhana gave the details of the odd situation, so he was sent south again with the intention of suppressing the increasing power of Malik Ambar
 ab malik ambar ne bijapur or golkunda se sahaayta lee or mughalon par tut padaa
 He thwarted the dining plan
 vivash hokar samrat ne rajkumaar or asaf khan ko ek badi sena ke saath dakshin bheja par use bhi koi safalataa na mili
 Malik Ambar's power grew day by day and in 1610 the problem became so severe that Asaf Khan requested the emperor to visit himself
 jahangir ne is suzav par vichaar kiya or dakshin prasthaan karne kii baat sochi parantu anya amiron ne iskaa samarthan na kiya
 Now the responsibility of solving the south problem was entrusted to Khan Jahan
 parantu iske purv ki vah vahaan pahunche khanekhana ne, apane beton kii madad se varsha ritu main malik ambar par achaanak hamale kii yojana banaakar usapar hamalaa kar diya
 Malik Ambar was sitting ready
 usne mughalon ke chakke chhudaa die or khanekhana ko burhanpur lautne par baadhya kar diya
 He also had to sign a treaty
 tatpashchaat malik ambar ne ahmednagar ke nikatavarti pradeshon par adhikaar karke uske kile par gheraa dhaala or usko bhi chin liya
 Barring parts of Berar and Valakat, almost the entire Nizamshahi kingdom over which the Mughals had taken control in 1600–1601 was now taken away by Malik Ambar and revived the Nizamshahi dynasty
 khanjahan lodi ne pradesh main pahunchakar vahaan ke vaataavaran se parichit hone kaa prayaas kiya
 He suggested to the emperor that he should be removed from the dining hall and given the charge of the post of commander
 usne vachan diya ki yadi uskaa prastaav sweekaar kar liya gaya to vah ahmednagar tathaa bijapur ke rajyon par mughal satta do varshon ke bheetar hi sthapit kar degaa
 Jahangir agreed to his words and gave him abundant wealth and army
 phir bhi jab vah malik ambar ke viruddh maidan main utraa, tab use yah prathit hua ki yadhyapi shatru kii talwaar uski talwaar se baari nahin, tathaapi uske ladane kaa dhang avashya hi niraala he
 It means to say that he too had to bow down before Malik Ambar and his pride was crushed
 malik ambar ko parrast karne ke abhipraay se samrat ne ek vishaal yojana banaai jiskaa yah uddeshy tha ki ahmednagar par teen dishaao se ek saath sainik abhiyaan karke malik ambar ko gherkar uski satta ko nasht bhrasht kar diya jaae
 But this plan also proved to be unsuccessful and the imperial army ran away in disarray
 khoi pratishtha ko pun: praapt karne ke uddeshy se khanekhana ko phir dakshin kshetra main bheja gaya
 He arrived there in 1612 AD
 uskaa yah saubhaahgya tha ki is samay nizaamshaah ke darbar main aantarik foot faili thi
 Benefiting from this situation, he bribed several southern chieftains and made them in his favor
 yadhyapi malik ambar ko bijapur or golkunda kaa sahyog praapt tha, tisapar bhi kootneeti or sabal sena ke saamne uski kuch na chali
 He had to be defeated in the war of 1616 AD
 vijetaon ne kirki ko nasht-bhrasht kar daalaa
 Although the Khankhana had restored Mughal prestige to a extent, it continued to be accused of bribery
 isiilie samrat ne rajkumaar khurram ko ek vishaal sena ke saath dakshin kshetra main bheja
 The arrival of the prince caused panic in the southern states
 sheeghra hi bijapur tathaa golkunda ke nareshon ne mughalon se sandhi kar lee
 In such a situation, while Malik Ambar became friendless, there was no other way than to bow his head before him
 atev vivash hokar usne balaghat kaa kshetra or ahmednagar ke durg kii kunjee mughalon ko saunp di or is prakaar nizaamshaahi rajya ko lop hone se bachaa liya
 For the next two years he was quietly mobilizing his resources
 idhar mughal sena main vidwesh kii prachand agni pravaahit ho gai
 Therefore, Malik Ambar again combined Golconda and Bijapur and established an anti-mughal union
 do varsh purv hui sandhi kii dhaaraon kaa ulanghan kar vah mughal adhikrut kshetron par tut padaa or teen maas kii laghu avadhi main hi usne mughlai ahmednagar ke adhikansh bhaag or baraar ko hastgat kar liya
 He not only looted Balapur but also besieged it
 burhanpur kii disha main peeche hatati hui mughal senaaon par nirantar waar karata hua vah burhanpur tak bad gaya
 Encircled the city and looted the neighboring region
 itnaa hi nahin, usne malwa main pravesh karke mandu par bhi chapa maaraa
 This greatly shocked the fame of the Mughals in the north and south regions of Narmada
 paristhiti ko nirantar gambhir hote hue dekhakar khanekhana ne sainik sahaayta kii baar baar yachana kii
 The emperor ordered Prince Shah Jahan to leave the army and south
 uske vahaan pahonchte hi vaataavaran shighrata se badalane laga
 His army covered the enemy's country like a storm
 marathe mandu se bhaag khadey hue or shatru ko burhanpur ko durg bhi khaali karnaa padaa
 The Mughals now attacked Kirkee
 sambhavat: nizamshaah apane parivaar sahit akramanakariyon ke haath pad jaataa parantu malik ambar ne un logon ko daulatabad bhej diya tha
 After moving from Kirkee, the Mughal army reached Ahmednagar and freed it from the siege
 malik ambar daulatabad ke durg se apane durbhaagya kii gatividhi ko dekh rahaa tha
 Shah Jahan did not want to pursue this war due to some adverse circumstances
 isliye usne sandhi karnaa hi uchit samajha
 Malik Ambar returned all the territory he had taken from the Mughals in the last two years
 iske atirikt 14 kos nikatavarti bhoomi bhi di
 The three southern princely states pledged to pay 50 lakh rupees as tax, 20 lakh by Golconda and the remaining 12 lakh by Ahmednagar
 is prakaar bade chaaturya se malik ambar ne nizaamshaahi rajya ko kaal ke munh se pun: nikaal liya
 But his woes did not end
 phir bhi uske saahas main kami na ai
 Shah Jahan revolted against his father, creating a political earthquake in the Mughal Empire
 atev jab uttar main parrast hokar vah dakshin pradesh main pahunchaa or usne malik ambar se sahaayta kii yachana kii, tab samrat kii shatruta mol lene ke bhay se malik ambar ne inkaar kar diya
 But there was a policy behind it
 sholapur ko lekar nizaamshaah or adilshaah main jhagada chal rahaa tha
 He hoped to get the sympathy of the Mughals in it
 atev jab mahavat khan shahjahan kaa peechha karte hue dakshin pradesh main pahunchaa, tab adilshaah or malik ambar donon ne hi mughlai sahaayta ke liye yachana kii
 For some time, Mahavat Khan kept the two in a dilemma, but when Shah Jahan ran towards Bengal, the Mughal commander pledged to help Adilshah
 parantu sheeghra hi use bengal kii ore janaa padaa
 Malik Ambar took full advantage of this opportunity
 suraksha hetu nizaamshaah ko to usne sapariwaar daulatabad bhej diya or swayan sena lekar golkunda kii seemaa kii ore badha
 After entering into a treaty with Qutb Shah, he broke the Adilshahi region
 vaanchit sthanon par adhikaar karke vah bijapur kii ore luutata hua agrasar hone laga
 Adilshah asked for help from the Mughals
 bhatwari kii ladaai main mughal adilshahi sena ne malik ambar kaa datakar saamana kiya
 But on 15 June 1625 Malik Ambar defeated him badly
 is safalataa ne uske yash or kirti main vruddhi kii
 Now he was considered a skilled commander, politician and manager
 uske saahas or sadhano main bhi unnati hui
 Consequently, he regained his dominion over Ahmednagar and Sholapur and his commander, Yakut Khan, laid siege to the fort of Burhanpur
 isi samay mahavat khan, shahjahan kaa peechha karte karte pun: dakshin aa pahunchaa
 Yakut Khan withdrew his army from Burhanpur
 malik ambar is baar shahjahan ko sarankshan dene main bilkul na hichkichaya
 The two joint forces besieged Burhanpur, but to no avail
 thode samay baad shahjahan ne hathiyaar daal die or apane ko samarpit kar diya
 In such a situation, it was difficult for Malik Ambar to face the Mughals
 atev usne burhanpur ke durg se sena hataa lee
 The following year he had the opportunity to compete with the Mughals
 is samay jahangir rogagrast tha
 Nur Jahan's faction forced Mahavat Khan to revolt, and entire royal forces were engaged in suppressing the rebellion of Mahavat Khan
 dakshin main koi bhi kushal senapati na rah gaya tha
 Death closed his eyes on May 14, 1615, at the age of eighty, before he could conduct the activities of his armies against the Mughals or against Adilshah
 1601 se 1626 tak, malik ambar ne apni pratibha, adamya saahas, kaarykushalta or sainya chaaturya kaa parichay diya
 Only such an example will be found in Indian history when an ordinary person has been given a new life by a desolate state
 malik ambar kii pratibha bahumukhi thi
 He was not only a capable commander, but was also a skilled politician and clever ruler
 usne maraathon kii sainik manovriti kaa thik moolyankan karke ek naveen sainik pranali kaa avishkaar kiya
 By making Todarmal's landlord system prevalent in his state, he not only made the empty fund prosperous but also provided happiness to the public

 boudhayan bharat ke pracheen ganitagya or shulb sutara tathaa shrautasutra ke rachayita the
 Euclid's geometry is taught all over the world, considering it to be authentic about geometry
 magar yah samaran rakhana chahie ki mahaan unani jyamitishastri euclid se purv hi bharat main kai rekhganitagya jyamiti ke mahatvapurn niyamon kii khoj kar chuke the, un rekhganitagyon main boudhayan kaa naam sarvopari he
 At that time geometry or geometry in India was called Shulva Shastra
 boudhayan ke sutara vaidic sanskrit main hai tathaa dharm, dainik karmkand, ganit aadi se sambandhit hai
 He belongs to the Taittiriya branch of Krishna Yajurveda
 sutara granthon main sambhavtah ye pracheenatam granth hai
 They were probably composed in the 8th-7th century BC
 boudhayan sutara ke antargat nimnlikhit 6 granth aate hai- The biggest thing is that Baudhayana's Shulbasutras have many results and theorems of elementary mathematics and geometry, including a square root approximation of 2, and a statement of the Pythagoras theorem
 samakon tribhuj se sambandhit pithagoras prameya sabase pehle maharishi bodhayan kii dein he
 Pythagoras was born in the 8th century before the birth of Jesus, whereas in ours it was taught before the 15th century before the birth of Jesus
 boudhayan kaa yah nimna likhit sutara he : The Buddhist verse number i
61-2 describes the method of deriving the length of a diagonal when given the lengths of the sides of a square
 duusare shabdon main yah 2 kaa vargamul nikaalane kii vidhi bataata he
 Ie yah maan dashamalav ke paanch sthanon tak shuddh he
 Some of the major theorems propounded by Boudhayan are- uparokt vivaran se spasht hota he ki boudhayan ne aayat, varg, samakon tribhuj samachatubhuj ke gunon tathaa kshetrafalon kaa vidhivat adhyayan kiya tha
 The Yaj was probably due to the importance of the 'yajna Bhoomika' made for the Yajna at that time
 "boudhayan" tathaa "boudhayaneey" shabdon ke liye "bodhayan" yaa "bodhyneey" kaa prayog dakshin bharat main bahudhaa kiya jaataa he
 But it is probably wrong because in the use of the word -ion, the vowel of the first letter becomes longer
 jaise- "dwaipayan", jo "dweep" va "ayan" par vibhinn vyakaraniya niyam lagaakar bana he

 uzbek bhashaa madhya asia main or visheshkar uzbekistan main, uzbek logon dwaara boli jane vaali ek turki bhashaa he
 In 1995, the number of speakers speaking it as mother tongue was estimated at around 2 crore
 haalaanki yah ek turki bhashaa he, phir bhi isamen farsi, arabi or roosi bhashaa kaa prabhaav miltaa he
 There are many similarities between Uzbek and Uygur languages, but Persian influence on Uzbek is much deeper than Uygur
 san 1927 tak uzbek ko likhane ke liye arabi-farsi varnmaala kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha, lekin uske baad uzbekistan kaa soviet sangh main vilay hone se vahaan sirilik lipi istemaal karne par jor diya gaya
 China's Uzbek communities still write Uzbek in arabic-persian script
 soviet sangh kaa ant hone ke baad uzbekistan main kuch log san 1992 ke uparant latin varnmaala kaa bhi prayog karne lage
 a lot of words are common in Hindi and Uzbek, but the Persian accent seems clearer in Uzbek than in Hindi
 isaki sabase badi misaal he ki hindi main aksar jahaan shabd main 'aa' kaa swar aata he, use uzbek main 'o' yaa 'o' ke swar ke saath kaha jaataa he
 Also note that the pronunciation of 'kh' in these words is slightly different from 'kh'
 aadhuniktaa shabd aamtaur par uttar-paaramparik, uttar-madhyayugin aitihaasik avadhi ko sanderbhit karata he, jo samantvaad se poonjeevaad, audyogikaran dharmanirpekshavaad, yuktikaran, raashtra-rajya or uski ghatak sansthaaon tathaa nigaraanee ke prakaaron kii ore kadam badhaane se chihnit hota he 
 avadharana ke aadhaar par, aadhuniktaa kaa sambandh aadhunik yug or aadhuniktaa se he, lekin yah ek vishisht avadharana kaa nirmaan karti he
 While the Enlightenment points to a specific movement in Western philosophy, modernity refers only to the social engagement associated with the rise of capitalism
 aadhuniktaa, bauddhik samskruti kii pravritiyon ko bhi sanderbhit kar sakati he, vishesh rup se un aandolanon ko jo dharmanirpeksikaran or uttar-audyogic jivan ke saath jude hue hai, jaise ki marxvad, astitvvaad or saamaajik vigyaan kii aupchaarik sthapana
 is sandarbh main, aadhuniktaa ko 1436-1789 ke saanskrithik or bauddhik andolanon ke saath joda gaya he jiskaa vistaar 1970 ke dashak tak yaa uske baad tak hua he It has been rightly said that "modernization is the current word for the old process
 It is the process of social change through which working societies achieve the general characteristics of developed societies"
 angrezi shabd "modern" kaa prayog 5 veen shatabdi se miltaa he, jo mul rup se isai yug ko butaparast yug se alag karne ke sandarbh main he, iske baavjood is shabd kaa saamaanya upyog 17 veen shatabdi main hi hona shuru hua jo ki quaral of di antient and di moderns se vyutpann hua tha - jisame yah bahes kii gayi thi ki: "kya aadhunik samskruti shastreey samskruti se behatar he?" - or yah bahes 1690 ke dashak ke armbh main academy francas ke bich saahitiyik or kalatmak vivaad thi
 According to these experiments, "modernity" meant abandoning the recent past, favoring a new beginning, and reinterpreting historical origins
 iske alaava, "aadhuniktaa" or "aadhunik" ke bich antar 19 veen sadi tak nahin ubhara tha
 According to a book by Marshall Burman, modernity is classified into three traditional stages: lotard or boudryllard jaise lekhakon kaa maananaa he ki aadhuniktaa 20 veen sadi ke madhya athwa uttarardh main samaapt ho gayi or is prakaar aadhuniktaa ke baad kii avadhi ko uttar-aadhuniktaa varnit kiya gaya he
 Other theorists have, however, considered the period from the end of the 20th century to the present time as another phase of modernity; This phase is called "liquid" modernism by Bouman or "high" modernity by Giddens
 raajnneetik rup se, aadhuniktaa kaa aarmabhik charan nicolo mekievilly kii kriti ke saath shuru hota he jisamen madhyayugin or arestu style se raajnneeti kaa vishleshan karne ko khule taur par khaarij kar diya gaya jo is baat par tulanaatmak vichaar karata he ki chizon ko kaise hona chahie or isaki bajaaye yathartwaadee vishleshan kaa paksh liya gaya ki vastav main chizein kis sthiti main hai
 He also proposed that the aim of politics is to control one's chances or destiny and relying on foresight actually leads to evil
 udhaaharan ke liye, mekiawali ne tark diya he ki raajnneetik samudaay ke bheetar hinsak vibhaajan aprihaary hai, lekin yah shakti kaa strot bhi ho saktaa he jis par kanoon nirmaataaon or netaaon ko bharosa karnaa chahie or kuch myanon main ise protsaahit tak karnaa chahie 
 Mackevali's recommendations sometimes exerted their influence on kings and princes, but eventually came to be seen as favoring independent republics rather than monarchies
 badale main mekiawali ne francis bekan, marchamont needom, herington,, jon milton, david hum, or kai anya ko prabhavit kiya 
 Important modern political theories that have arisen from new Maciévelli realism include Mendeville's influential proposition that "with the skillful management of a skilled politician private arrogance can be turned into civil benefits" and "constitutional division of power" in government, It was first explicitly proposed by Montescue
 in donon siddhanton ko adhikansh aadhunik loktantr ke samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya he
 It has been observed that while the realism of Mekiyevali was seen in the value war and political violence, its lasting impact was "controlled" so that useful conflict was deliberately converted into formal political conflict as much as possible and economic "conflict" Encourage free, private enterprises
 thomas hobs se shuru karte hue, aise prayaas kiye gaye taaki bekan or dekart dwaara prastaavit aadhunik bhautik vigyaan ke tareekon kaa upyog kiya ja sake or jise maanavtaa or raajnneeti par lagu kiya ja sake 
 hobs kii karypranali drushtikon ke vikaas ke ullekhneey prayaas main shaamil hai loke, spinoja, giambatista vico or ruso 
 david hum ne pehali baar bekan ke vaigyanik tareeke ko raajnneetik vishyon par lagu karne kii koshish kii or is prayaas main hobs ke drushtikon ke pahaluon main se kuch ko asweekaar kiya
 Modernist republicanism openly influenced the founding of the republic during the Dutch Rebellion, the English Civil War, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution
 aadhuniktaavaadi raajnneetik soch kaa ek doosraa charan ruso se shuru hota he, jisane maanavtaa kii swaabhaavik vivekshiltaa or saamaajikta par prashn kiya or prasthaapit kiya ki maanav prakruti ko pehle jitna lacheela samajha jaataa tha vah usase adhik lacheela he
 On the basis of this logic, what makes up a good political system or a good man is entirely dependent on the congenial path which people have followed throughout history
 is vichaar ne emenual kaant, edmund bark or anya logon kii raajnneetik soch ko prabhavit kiya or isane aadhuniktaavaadi raajnneeti kii mahatvapurn samiksha ko prerit kiya
 On the conservative side, Burke argued that this understanding encouraged vigilance and avoidance of revolutionary change
 haalanki is soch ne maanav samskruti main adhik mahatvakankshi andolanon ko bhi prerit kiya, shuruyaat main svachhndathawad or itihaasawad or antat karl marks ke samyawad ko or rashtrawaad ke aadhunik roopon ko jo francisi kranti se prerit tha, jisamen apane charam rup main german naaji aandolan shaamil tha
 In the subject sociology that emerged in direct response to the social problems of modernity, the term generally refers to the social status, processes, and discourses that resulted from the Enlightenment era
 sabase buniyadi sandarbh main, anthoni gidence aadhuniktaa kaa varnan is rup main karte hai 


 a shorthand word for modern society, or industrial civilization
 When depicted in greater detail, it has an associated approach to the world, the idea of a world that is ready for change, through human intervention; Complex of economic institutions, particularly industrial production and a market economy; a certain series of political institutions, including nation-state and mass democracy
 Broadly as a result of these characteristics, modernity is more dynamic than any earlier social system
 yah ek samaaj he - adhik takneekee rup se sansthaaon kaa parisar he - jo, kisi purv samskruti ke vipareet, ateet ke bajaaye bhavishya main jeeta he 
 Modernism is "directed towards a progressive force that promises to free mankind from ignorance and irrationality"
 With new social and philosophical terms, however, fundamental new challenges arose
 The era of modernity is socially characterized by industrialization and division of labor, and philosophically "a loss of certainty and the realization that certainty can never be established, never will"
 At the center of this loss of certainty is the loss of religion
 19 veen sadi ke vibhinn buddhijiviyon ne, jinamein shaamil hai august comte se lekar karl marks or sigmund frid ne dharmanirpeksikaran ke maddenzar vaigyanik or / yaa raajnneetik vichaardhaaraon ko pesh karne kii koshish kii
 aadhuniktaa ko "vichaardhaara kii umr" ke rup main varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 Theorists such as Theodore Adorno and Zigmunt Baumann proposed that modernity represents a departure from the central elements of the Enlightenment and that separation leads to nefarious processes of emotion, such as object love and holocaust
 Contemporary critical theory presents rationalization as originally defined by Weber in more negative terms
 yuktikaran kii prakriyaayein - jaise ki vikaas kii khatir vikaas - kai maamalon main inkaa aadhunik samaaj par ek nakaaratmak or amanviya prabhaav ho saktaa he
 As a result of the debate about economic globalization, the comparative analysis of civilizations and the post-colonial view of "alternative modernities", Samuel Eisenstadt introduced the concept of "multi-modernity"
 Modernity as a "plural status" is at the heart of this social outlook and perspective, pointing to European Western culture specifically for a cosmopolitan definition and thus "modernism is not Westernization and its major processes and dynamics are all Can be found in society
 14 veen sadi main, koparnicus, kepler, galileo or dusron ne bhautikee or khagolashastra ke prati ek nai drushtikon viksit kii jisane logon ke sochane ke tareeke ko badla
 koparnicus ne saura pranali ke nae model prastut kiye jo maanavtaa ke ghar prithvi ko ab centre main nahin rakhte
 kepler ne bhautikee kii charchaa karne ke liye ganit kaa istemaal kiya or prakruti kii niyamittaaon kaa is tarah varnan kiya
 Galileo presented the proof of equal acceleration in free fall using mathematics
 francis bekan ne vishesh rup se apane novam orgenam main vigyaan ke prati nae prayogtmak aadhaarit drushtikon kii maang kii, jisane aupchaarik yaa antim kaarnon ke gyaan kii zarurat par jor nahin diya or isliye bhautikwaadi tha, jo democritus or epicuras ke pracheen darshan kii tarah tha
 But he also added a topic that science should try to control nature for the sake of humanity and it should not be understood just to understand
 in donon baton ke sandarbh main vah mekievaali kii madhyayugin shastreey roodhiwaadita kii purv kii aalochana se prabhavit tha or uske is prastaav se ki netaaon ko apane bhagya ko khud niyantrit karnaa chahie 
 Influenced by both Galileo's new physics and Bacon, René decart soon argued that mathematics and geometry provided a model for how scientific knowledge could be built in small steps
 unhone khule taur par yah bhi tark diya ki maanav ko swayan main ek jatil mashin ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he 
 Isaac Newton, influenced by decart and choosing Bacon's experimental step, provided a typical example of how Cartesian mathematics, geometry and theoretical incorporation on the one hand and Baconian experimental observation and advent on the other, together, of the regularities of nature Can help a lot in real understanding
 frans main aadhuniktaavaadi raajnneetik soch pehle se hi vyapak rup se gyaat thi, ruso dwaara maanav prakruti kaa punah pareekshan karne ke parinamswaroop khud tark ke mulya par ek nae sire se aalochana shuru ho gayi jisane badale main kam buddhivaadee maanav gatividhiyon kii ore prerit kiya, vishesh rup se kala kii ore
 iskaa praarambhik prabhaav 18 veen or 19 veen sadi main un andolanon par padaa jise ham german adarshavaad or svachhndathawad ke rup main jaanate hai
 Modern art is therefore considered only in the later stages of modernity
 is kaaran se kala kaa itihaas, "aadhuniktaa" ko aadhunik yug or aadhuniktawaad shabd se alag kar ke dekhtaa he - vah ise ek asatat "shabd ke rup main dekhtaa he jiskaa prayog us saanskrithik avasthaa ke liye kiya jaataa he jisamen navachaar kii prakat hone vaali param aavashyaktaa jivan, kaary or vichaaron kii ek praathmik shart ban jaati he"
 or kala main aadhuniktaa "aadhunik hone kii avasthaa se kahin adhik he, yaa puraane or nae ke bich virodh se adhik he" 
 In the essay "the Painter of Modern Life" Charles Baudlair gives a literal definition: "by modernity i mean fleeting, fugitive, accidental"
 samajashaastra main uplabdh vaicharik paribhaashaon main se, aadhuniktaa ko "'saboot' drishy samskruti or vyaktigat drishyata ke junun dwaara chihnit" or paribhaashit kiya gaya he, 
 aam taur par, aadhuniktaa kaa gathan karne vaale bade paimaane par saamaajik ekikaran main shaamil he: Hindi poet and writer amritam kuritina raatri telugu bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar di
 balgangadhar tilak dwaara rachit ek kavita–sangrah he jiske liye unhen san 1970 main telugu bhashaa ke liye maranoparant sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 The digestive placenta or alimentary canal of a human is a 25 to 30 feet long placenta that extends from the mouth to the end of the rectum or anus
 yah ek santat lambii nalee he, jisamen aahaar munh main pravisht hone ke pashchaat grasanal, amashay, grahani, kshudrantra, brihadantra, malashay or guda naamak avyavon main hota hua gudadwar se mel ke rup main baahar nikal jaataa he
 The nutritional placenta or digestive tract has three functions: pehla kaary un pachak rason dwaara purna hota he jo pachak naal main sthit, yaa usamen sambandhit, grathiyon main utpann hokar vahiniyon dwaara naal main aakar aahaar main mil jate hai
 These juices are chemical substances and by differentiating the various components of the diet by their chemical action, they are brought in such forms that they can take part of the body
 doosraa kaary us gatiyon dwaara sampadit hota he jo pachan naal kii bhittiyon main sthit anaichhik peshisutron ke sankoch or vistaar se naal main hoti rahati hai
 The editing of the third function is a special feature of the asteroid, although some absorption occurs in other parts as well
 aahaar padaarthon ke vishesh ghatak protein, carbohydrate, vasa, vitamin, khanij lavan or jal hai
 All foods are made up of these components
 kisi main koi ghatak adhik hota he, koi kam
 Our body is also made of these ingredients
 sharir kaa 2 / 3 bhaag jal he
 Protein is the main body of the body from which organs are formed
 carbohydrate glucose ke rup main sharir main rahata he, jisaki mansapeshiyon ko sadaa aavashyaktaa hoti he
 An excessive amount of fat is also stored in the body
 vitamin or lavenon kii aavashyaktaa sharir kii kriyaaon ke uchit sampadan ke liye hoti hai
 Our body gets all these things from food
 haan, aahaar se milanevaale avyavon kaa rasinic rup sharir ke avyavon ke rup se bhinn hota he
 Therefore, the body decomposes the components of the diet into its subtle components by digestive juices and by re-synthesizing those components, prepares the ingredients suitable for them
 yah kaam angon kii koshikaaye karti hai
 It leaves out the components that are not useful
 sharir aise padaarthon ko mel, mutr, swead or shwaas dwaara baahar nikaal detaa he
 The mouth is a large cotter, with the tongue at the bottom and the hard and soft palate at the top and the cortex of the cheeks on either side

 Below this is the floor of the mouth
