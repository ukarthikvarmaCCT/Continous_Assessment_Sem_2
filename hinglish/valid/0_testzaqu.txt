 Human activity has increased since the Industrial Revolution, which has led to a significant increase in the amount of greenhouse gases, which has also led to greatly increased diffuse bound CO 2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFC and s nitrous
 Methane is more effective than greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, but its concentration is so low that its radiative strength is only one f, compared to carbon dioxide
 Some other gases that are naturally occurring contribute to the greenhouse effect

 There is a possibility of higher CO2 levels in the future as there is a lot of change in fossil fuels and land use
 The rate of increase will depend on uncertain economic, social, technological and natural phenomena but perhaps the availability of fossil fuels will ultimately prove to be the deciding factor

 As the atmosphere gets warmer, the advisory response process is related to the change in the lapse rate

 The emission of infrared radiation depends on the fourth power of temperature, longer radiation is emitted from the top layer of the atmosphere and less than the lower layer

 The land in the northern hemisphere is more jiada, so it heats up faster than the southern hemisphere
 Seasonal ice and sea in the northern hemisphere There are extensive areas of ice that depend on ice-albedo feedback in the northern hemisphere, more than in the southern hemisphere
 Green house gases are emitted, but it is not responsible for the difference in heat as the major greenhouse gases stay for a long time and mix well in both hemispheres

 Surrey modern climate models are an abstract model in itself
 And this is different with the model of the sea and the model of ice on land and sea
 In some models chemical and biological Treatments of processes are also involved
 This model finds that if the effect of greenhouse gases is added, a warmer climate is attained
 Nevertheless, even when this assumption is used, climate sensitivity still has a large role

 The roots of the mathematically strict treatment of fractals can be traced to the study of functions by Karl Weierstras, George Canter and Felix Hausdraf, who studied functions that were analytical, but not discriminatory; However, in 1975 the English word fractal was coined by fractal Beno बेt Mendelbrot and is derived from the Latin fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured"
 a mathematical fractal is based on an equation that undergoes iteration, a type of feedback format based on recursion
 ek bhagn main aksar nimnlikhit suvidhaayen hoti hai: Because they appear the same at all levels of magnification, fractals are often considered highly complex
 prakritik vasteen, joki ek ansh tak bhagnon ke anuroop hai, main shaamil hai badal, parvat shrinkhalaa, vajrapaat, tat-rekhaaen, himalav, vibhinn subjiyan or jaanavar ke rangai pattern

 Fractal images can be created using fractal-derivative software
 is tarah ke software dwaara utpaadit chhaviyon ko saamaanya rup se bhagn kah kar sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, bhale hi unamem uparokt visheshtaayen nahin hon, jaise ki jab bhagn ke ek kshetra main zum karnaa sambhav ho to vah bhagn kii kisi bhi visheshta ko pradarshit nahin karata he
 In addition, these may include enumerated or demonstrative human-made objects that are not characteristic of real fractals

 In 1872, a function appeared, whose graph is considered fractal today, when Karl Weierstrass gave the example of a function with an uneasy quality everywhere but everywhere that is not differentiable
 In 1904, Helge von Koch, dissatisfied with Weierstrasse's absolute and analytical definition, gave a more geometric definition for a similar function, which is today called the Koch curve

 unhone is ganitiya paribhaasha ko asaadhaaran computer-nirmit kalpana sahit sodaaharan varnit kiya
 These images captured the popular imagination; Many of which were based on recursion, which clarifies the prevalent meaning of the term "fractal"

 Additional examples of fractals include the Lyupunov fractal and a limited set of clinic groups
 Fractals can be deterministic or predictable

 Fractures are sometimes associated with disordered dynamic systems
 gatisheel pranali ke pravastha kaal main vasteen bhagn ho sakati hai 
 pranaaliyon ke varg hetu prachal kaal main bhi vasteen bhagn ho sakati hai
 An interesting example is the Mandelbrot set
 This set includes the entire disc, so it has a Hausdorff dimension equal to the topological dimension of 2 — but what really strikes us is that the Mendelbrot set also has a Hausdorff dimension of 2, the result of which is Mitsuhiro in 1991

 There are four common techniques for creating fractals: bhagnon ko unke swa-samanta ke anusaar bhi vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Three types of similarities have been found in fractals: kisi vastu ko bhagn kehane ke liye swa-samanta kii maujuudagi hi ekmaatr kasuti nahin he
 Examples of self-similar objects, which are not fractals, include logarithmic spirals and straight lines, which have their own copies on small magnifying scales

 Adjacent fractals are easily found in nature

 Examples include clouds, icebergs, crystals, mountain ranges, lightning, river nets, cauliflower or broccoli, and systems of blood vessels and pulmonary vessels
 The coastlines can be broadly considered fractal in nature
 vrikshon or fernon kaa swaroop bhagn hota he or punaravarti elgoridam ke upyog dwaara computer par praturup banaaya ja saktaa he
 This recursive nature is evident in these examples — a tree branch or fern is a miniature replica of a whole: a tree is a tree from one or a branch
 In clear these examples are a complete miniature of the same replica: not identical, but Of similar appearance

 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii

 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life

 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee

 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya

 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga

 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho

 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he

 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua

 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever

 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya

 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa

 God and soul cannot save society
 ambedkar ke anusaar sachcha dharm wo hi he jiskaa kendra manushya tathaa naitikta ho, vigyaan athwa bauddhik tatv par aadhaarit ho, na ki dharm kaa kendra ishwar, aatma kii mukti or moksh
 At the same time, he said that the work of religion should be to rebuild the world and not to explain its origin and end

 After all, what are we doing for this freedom? We are getting this freedom to improve our social system, which is full of inequality, discrimination and other things that conflict with our fundamental rights

 Hazrat Umar ibn al-khatab, E
 Muhammad Saheb's chief was among the four Sahaba
 vah hazarat abu bakr ke baad musalamaanon ke duusare khalipha chune gayi
 Muhammad was named as Farooq
 jiskaa arth satya or asaty main fark karne vaala
 His status among the followers of Muhammad sahab comes after Hazrat Abu Bakr
 umr khulpha-e-raashidin main duusare calipha chune gaye
 Omar proved to be the most successful caliph in the khulafa-e-rashidin
 musalmaan inako faruk-e-aazam tathaa amirul muminin bhi kehete hai
 European writers have written many books about him and given the title of Omar Mahan
 prasiddh lekhak maaikel ech
 heart ne apni prasiddh pustak di handred The 100: a Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History, main hazarat umr ko shaamil kiya he
 Hazrat Umar was born in Mecca
 ye kurash khandaan se the
 i had learned to read writing in the days of ignorance, which in those days, the Arabs considered reading writing to be a useless task
 inkaa qad bahut ooncha, raubadaar cheharaa or gathila sharir tha
 Umar was one of the famous wrestlers of Mecca, who had a great influence in Mecca
 umr salanaa pahalwani ke muqablon main hissaa lete the
 Initially, Hazrat Umar was a staunch enemy of Islam
 or mohammad sahab ko jaan se maarna chaahate the
 Omar initially used to do fetishism
 umr makka main ek samrudgh parivaar se the, bahut bahadur tathaa diler vyakit the
 Omar did not like Muslims, nor did Muhammad's mission
 parantu paigambar muhammd sahab ek shaam kaabe ke paas jaakar allaah se dua kiya ki allaah umr ko yaa amr abu jahal donon main se jo tujko priy ho hidaayat de
 This prayer was accepted in favor of Omar
 umr ek baar paigambar ke katl ke iraade se nikle the, raste main naeem naam kaa ek shaks mila jisane umr ko bataaya ki unki bahan tathaa unke pati islam laa chuke hai
 Omar got angry and went to the sister's house
 vah donon ghar par kuran pard rahe the
 Umar started asking for the Quran but he refused
 umr krodhit hokar un donon ko maarane lage
 But his sister said we will die but will not leave Islam
 bahan ke chehre se khun tapakataa dekhakar umr ko shame aayi tathaa galati kaa ahsaas hua
 Said that i want to read the Quran, promised not to humiliate it
 jab umr ne kuran padhaa do bole yaqinan ye ishwar kii vaani he kisi manushya kii rachana nahin ho sakati
 In a miracle, Omar accepted the truth of the Quran and went to meet Muhammad
 mohammad sahab ko bahut prasannataa hui jab umr islam main daakhil ho gayi
 Muslims ran a wave of happiness over Omar's bringing Islam
 umr ne elaan kiya ki ab sab milke namaaz kaabe main padhenge jo ki pehle koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha
 Omar was an enemy of Islam but now he became the protector of Islam
 umr ko islam main dekhakar mohammad sahab ke shatruvon main koharaam much gaya
 Now Islam had got a sharp sword named Umar which made all Mecca tremble
 makka waalon ne kamazor musalamaanon par sitam tej kar diye jisko dekhakar mohammad sahab ne allaah se dua kii to allaah ne madeene jane kaa hukum diya
 All the Muslims started hiding in Hijrat i
e
 towards Madinah
 magar umr bade diler the apni talwaar lee dhanush baan liya, kaaba ke paas pahunch kar tawaaf kiya, do rachaat namaaz padhi phir kaha "jo apni maan ko apane par rulaanaa chahta he, apane bacchon ko anaath tathaa apni patni ko vidhwaa bananaa chahta he is jagah mili
 "nobody dared to stop Omar
 umr ne elaan karke hizrat kii
 Medina had become a new center of Islam
 san hijri islaami calendar kaa nirmaan kiya jo islam kaa panchang kehalaata he
 In 624 AD, Muslims had to fight the battle of Badr, in which Hazrat Umar also played an important role
 badr kii jang main musalamaanon kii fatah hui tathaa makka ke musharikon kii haar hui
 a year after the battle of Badr, the Meccans came together to attack Madina, the battle took place near a hill called Uhud
 jang ke shuru main muslim sena baari padi lekin kuch kaarnon vash muslimon kii haar hui
 Some people sparked the rumor that many Muslims were frightened if Muhammad Sahib was martyred, Omar also threw a sword and started saying that it is useless to live now
 kuch derbar pataa chalaa kii ye ek afvaah he to dubaara khadey hue
 After this, they lived together in Khandak's war
 umr ne muslim sena kaa netratv kiya ant main makka bhi fatah ho gaya
 Even after this, many battles had to be faced, Omar led an eye in all those wars
 8 june san 632 ko mohammad sahab duniya ko alavida kah gayi
 Omar and some people did not believe that Muhammad could also have death
 ye khabar sunakar umr apane hosh kho baithe, apni talwaar nikaal lee tathaa jor-jor se kehane lage ki jisane kaha ki nabi kii maut ho gai he main uskaa sar tan se juda kar duungaa
 On this delicate occasion, then Hazrat Abu Bakr gave a Khutba meaning speech to Muslims which is very famous: phir koran kii aayat pard kar sunai: Hearing from Hazrat Abu Bakr, all the people fell on their knees, Umar also fell on his knees and accepted this great sorrow
 jab hazarat abu bakr ko laga ki unka vaqt nazadik he to unhone agle khalipha ke liye hazarat umr ko chunaa
 Omar was well known for his extraordinary will power, intelligence, political, impartiality, justice and care for the poor and underprivileged
 hazarat abu bakr ko puri tarah se umr kii shakti or unako safal hone kii kshamta ke bare main pataa tha
 The succession of Omar was thus not as troublesome as any of the others
 hazarat abu bakr ne apni mrityu ke pehle hi hazarat usmaan ko apni vasiyat likhavai ki umr unke uttaradhikari honge
 Hazrat Abu Bakr died in August 634 AD
 umr ab calipha ho gayi tathaa ek naye daur kii shruwaat hui
