 Caffeine molecules are similar in structure to adenosine and bind adenosine receptors to the surface of cells without activating them
 Therefore, caffeine acts as a competitive inhibitor

 Since caffeine is the antagonist of the central nervous system's receptors primarily for the neurotransmitter adenosine, caffeine is consumed regularly, so they are well adapted to the continued presence of this drug, because of the adenosine receptors in the central nervous system
 The number has increased considerably
 pehla, caffeine ke uttejnadaayak prabhaav kaaphi kam ho jate hai, is ghatana ko sahansheel anukulan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Second, as these adaptive responses to caffeine make individuals more susceptible to adenosine, caffeine intake effectively increases the general physiological effect of adenosine, resulting in unpleasant withdrawal symptoms in tolerant users

 Since this condition may simulate somatic mental disorders such as fear disorder, general anxiety disorder, two-polar disorder, or even schizophrenia, many medical experts believe that caffeine-alcoholics are equally misdiagnosed
 And they are given medications unnecessarily, while stopping caffeine intake can only cure caffeine-induced psychosis

 The FSA stated that the study's design made it impossible to determine whether this difference is due to caffeine itself, or other lifestyle differences other than that are probably associated with excessive consumption of caffeine, but the decision to recommend being vigilant was done
 kaisar permanent divijan of research ke dow de-kun lee ne american jarnal of obstetrics or ginocology main ek aalekh main likhaa he ki pratidin 200 millilitre yaa usase adhik lenaa, do yaa do se adhik cap lene jitna he, "isse garbhpaat kaa khatra kaaphi adhik bad jaataa he"

 a 2006 study by Dr
 Ahmed Al Sohemi at the University of Toronto discovered the effect of coffee on genes affecting caffeine metabolism and health
 kuch log ek vishisht prakaar ke cytochrome pi450 jin ke roopantaran ke kaaran saamaanya logon kii tulana main caffeine ko bahut hi dhimi gati se pachaate hai or jin logon main yah jin hota he unke adhik maatra main coffee pine se hridaypeshiy rodhgalan kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 However, coffee appears to have rapid metabolic inhibitory effects
 tulanaatmak rup se saamaanya logon main dhimi or tej chayapachay aam hai or iske liye sehat par caffeine ke prabhaav par honevaale adhyayanon kii bhinnata ko jimmevaar tehraaya gaya he
 Recent data suggest that intake of caffeine may increase intraocular pressure

 The extraction of caffeine from coffee is an important industrial process for caffeine-free coffee and caffeine production, and can be done using a variety of solvents
 benzene chloroform, trichlorethailin or dechloromithen in sabhi kaa saalon se prayog kiya ja rahaa he, lekin suraksha, paryaavarniya prabhaav, laagat or swaad ke kaarnon se inkaa nimnlikhit pramukh tareekon dwaara adhikraman ho rahaa he: Coffee beans are soaked in water
 jis jal main caffeine ke alaava anya bahut tarah ke yogic hote hai jo coffee ke swaad ko badhaate hai, us jal ko sakriy charcol se paarit karaayaa jaataa he, jisase caffeine alag ho jaataa he
 After that, without extracting caffeine the coffee with its original taste can be dried and evaporated by separating the beans from that water
 coffee nirmaataa caffeine ko alag nikaal lete hai or sheethal peya main iskaa istemaal karne ke liye or bagaiyr nuskhaa ke caffeine kii goliyon ke rup main phir se bech dete hai
 Micro-carbon dioxide is an excellent non-ionic solvent for caffeine and is far safer than organic solvents, which are used as an alternative
 nishkarshan kii prakriya saral he: 31
1 degree celsius se adhik taapmaana par hare coffee beans par CO2 daalaa jaataa he or 73 atm kaa dabaav daalaa jaataa he
 In such a situation, the state of CO2 becomes much finer: it has a gas-like characteristic that allows it to penetrate much deeper into the beans, but it also has the characteristic of a liquid that dissolves 97–99% of caffeine
 phir CO2 vaale caffeine main se caffeine nikaalane ke liye ucch dabaav ke saath pani kaa chhidkaav kiya jaataa he
 Caffeine can then be separated by adsorption in charcoal or by distillation or re-crystallization or reverse osmosis
 pehle istemaal hone vaale chlorinated va aromatic vilaayakon kii tulana main ethil acitate jaise carbonic vilaayak kam swasthya va paryaavarniya jokhim upasthit karte hai
 Another method is to use triglyceride oil obtained from used coffee plantations
 kuch purvavarti sant, seventh-de adventist, carch of god anuyaayi or isai vaigyanik caffeine kaa upbhog nahin karte
 in dharmon ke kuch anuyaayiyon kaa maananaa he ki ek gaiyr-aushadhiy, manosphurtidayak padaarth kaa upbhog nahin karnaa chahie yaa unka vishwaas he ki kisi nashile padaarth kaa seven nahin karnaa chahie
 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has said the following about the consumption of caffeinated drinks: "the Church has never officially taken any step regarding this in relation to cola drinks, but church leaders There is advice and we now specifically advise against any drinks that contain harmful drugs, which can lead to circumstantial habituation
 jis kisi peya padaarth main sharir ke liye hanikaarak saamagree hoti he, usase bachaa janaa chahie
" Gaudiya Vaishnavas or Chaitanya Vaishnavas also generally abstain from caffeine, as they say it pollutes the mind and over-stimulates the senses
 ek guru ke maatahat aane se pehle kisi vyakti ko kam se kam ek saal ke liye caffeine se dur rahanaa jaruri he
 The main rule regarding caffeine in Islam is that its consumption is permissible, but it is worth noting that it is unqualified and can cause serious harm to one's health
 jahaan tak coffee main caffeine kaa sawaal he, imam shihab al-deen ne kaha: 'iskaa seven halaal he, kyonki sabhi chijen halaal he keval unhen chhodkar jise allaah ne haraam banaaya he'

 aisa mana jaataa he ki karnataka rajvansh ke saath hi pracheen itihaas kaa kram tut gaya tha
 During this period, the invasion of Turks had also started and Bihar was not an organized political unit but was divided in the north region and south regional influence
 atah madhyakaalin bihar kaa aitihaasik strot praapt karne ke liye vibhinn aitihaasik granthon kaa drushtipaat karnaa padataa he jo is kaal main rachit hue the
 Records in medieval Bihar sources, sources of Nuhani state, political life of various kings and landlords and their struggle with other powers, details given by travelers, etc
 are important

 It was invented in 1958 by Robert Noyce and Jack Kilbey
 ye donon alag-alag companiyon main kaam karte the or donon hi companiyaan is shodh ko apane drushtikon se kar rahi thi
 After this research, both companies applied for its patent
 baad main donon companiyon ko sammilit rup se iskaa license diya gaya or iskaa sammilat patent diya gaya
 Microchip was first available to the people in 1961
 jik kilbe ne hi baad main portable calculator kaa avishkaar kiya
 Since then, there have been many changes in the microchip
 pehali sookshmchip main jahaan ek transistor, ek capaceter or teen register the, vahiin aaj kii sookshmchip main ek choti si jagah main lagbhag 125 million transistor samaae hote hai
 Microchip also has many more benefits

 Both were electrical engineers and both were trying to solve how to reliably construct circuits with multiple numbers and how to reduce their size
 aaj ham kah sakate hai ki yadi tronsister kaa avishkaar na hota to ekipari na hota; or ekipari na hota to computer or anya electronic upkaran na hote jinka paripath karodon-arabon avyavon se bana hota he
 The development of monopoly has the following benefits: ekikrut paripathon ko unke andar ke paripath kii prakruti ke aadhaar par teen bhaagon main baanta jaataa he- Digital integrated circuits are divided into Small Scale Integrated, Medium Scale Integrated, Large Scale Integrated, Very Large Scale Integrated, Ultra Large Scale Integrated etc
 based on the number of transistors used in them

 Harishankar Parsai was a famous Hindi writer and satirist
 unka janm jamaani, hoshangabad, madhya pradesh main hua tha
 He was the first creator of Hindi to give satire the status of genre and relieve it from the traditional periphery of light entertainment and connected it to the wider questions of society

 Compounds made of aldihado are called aldoxim and compounds made from ketones are called insectoxim
 inke sutara saamne ke chitra main darshaae gayi hai
 Oximes are chemical compounds whose general formula is R1R2C = NOH in which R1 is an organic chain and R2 is either hydrogen that forms aldaxime or another organic group that forms ketoxime
 sabase pehla oxim victor meyar ne san 1878 i
 main banaaya tha
 Subsequently, due to the importance of oxides in the purification and identification of aldehydes and ketones, and the configurational isomerism of these compounds, chemists showed special interest in their study, resulting in a number of important research related to them
 aldihidon tathaa kitonon ke shuddhikaran tathaa pahchaan main inke upyog kaa vishesh kaaran yah he ki oxim thos avasthaa main manibhiya tathaa jal main aviley hote hai; at: inako shuddh avasthaa main praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Heating with hydrochloric or sulfuric acid solutions results in hydrolysis of oximes
 iske falswaroop aldihide yaa kitone swatantra avasthaa main pun: praapt ho jate hai
 Reduced amino acids are the primary amino acids, thus they are used to convert C-OCO-C-NH
 aldoxim acid chloride dwaara nirjalit kiye ja sakate hai jisase kuch oxim, dhatviya tatwon ke saath sanyukt hokar, sthaayee savarg yogic banaate hai
 The solubility of compounds formed in this way differs from each other due to the similar properties and related diverse elements
 is kaaran, vaishleshik rasayan main, in oxymon kaa bada mahatv he
 Salicyl Aldaxim makes this type of compound from many metals, but all compounds made from other metals are soluble in dilute acetic acid, except compounds made with copper
 taanbe ke saath bana yogic haritabh-pit rang kaa ek churna sa hota he or ise 110° sein
 par sukhaakar sthaayee rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, Ifemem has suggested to use this Oxim for the separation and elimination of copper from other elements
 isi prakaar diamethil glaiksim, jo diketone-daai-acittle kaa daai-oxim he, anek dhaatuon ke saath sankeern yogic banaata he, jinamein se keval nikal tathaa paladium se bane yogic tanu amlon tathaa tanu kshar vilyanon main aviley hote hai
 Therefore, this oxim is used a lot in the measurement of nickel and palladium and completely separating nickel from cobalt
 beta napthoquinon kaa ek oxim cobalt ke saath isi prakaar kaa aviley yogic banaata he, jisase cobalt ke parimaapan main iskaa upyog hota he
 The importance of oxymes in the development of configurational chemistry is no less
 san 1883 i
 main hanse goldsmit ne gyaat kiya ki benzil kaa dwi-oxim do roopon main paaya jaataa he, phir san 1889 i
 main victor meyar ne ek teesraa rup bhi gyaat kiya
 In the same year, Beckman reported that benzaldehyde is also found in two forms
 waant hof ne >C = CC = N- vaale yogicon main lagaakar yah dikhalaya ki oxymon ke samavyav jyamitiya samavyav hai
 According to him, oxides of aldehydes and asymmetric ketones can be found in two forms, which can be written as follows: yah samavyawata thik usee prakaar kii he jaisi mailic amla tathaa fumeric amla kii >C = C< par
 In ketones, this is only possible in asymmetric ketones, as there is no difference between these two forms once R1 and R2 unite
 iske aadhaar par benzil dwi-oxim ke rup bhi likhe ja sakate hai
 The reaction of water on the substance obtained by reacting ether of ketones with phosphorus pentaoxide in the ether gives substituted acid-amides
 is kriya ko bekaman punarvinyas kehete hai
 The roots change in this verb
 jo mulak pehle carbon ke saath sanyukt tha, ab vah nitrogen ke saath sanyukt mulak se sthanantaran kar letaa he
 The formation of these substances as a result of the Beckman transformation confirms that the composition of the isobes is the same, but its isomerism is due to its different location at the base of the roots
