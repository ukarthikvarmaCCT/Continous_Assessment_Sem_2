 Sayanacharya mentions the velocity of light as follows: durgadas ek upanyaas he jo ek vir vyakti durgadas rathod ke jivan par munshi premchand dwaara likhit he
 It can also be called a heroic saga that teaches us many things
 yah bal sahitya ke antargat aata he tathaa iske mukhya prakaashak bhartiya gyanpith he
 It tells how Durgadas, the servant of King Yashwant Singh, after his death, secured the king's son Ajitsingh from Aurangzeb and his Mughal army and drove Aurangzeb from Marwar and handed over the kingdom to Ajitsingh
 tathaa kis prakaar use dusht ajitsingh se dur bhaagna padaa
 Durgadas is a historical novel by the great novelist Munshi Premchand, written mainly in Urdu script and whose Hindi translation was first published in 1915
 isamen ek vir kii sangharmpurn gaatha he jo apane mathrabhumi ke liye apana sar katwane tak ko taiyaar tha
 Premchand himself describes them
 premchand ke shabdon main -- raajapootaana main bade-bade shur-vir ho gayi hai
 That desert has given birth to so many gems; But Veer Durgadas is like Kohanoor for his unmatched self-sacrifice, his selfless devotion and his bright character
 auron main shaury ke saath kahin-kahin hinsa or dwesh kaa bhav bhi paaya jayega, kirti kaa moh bhi hoga, abhimaan bhi hoga; par durgadas shur hokar bhi sadhu purush the
 In this, Premchand has introduced important facts while presenting his creativity
 abhi isaki pustika bhartiya gyanpith dwaara prastut he jiskaa is press se pehla sanskaran 1 janvari san 2011 main prakashit hua
 This story is suitable for heroic saga lovers as well as literature and history researchers
 durgadas ek baar san 1915 main sachitr prakashit hui thi, yah mukhya rup se bal pustika ke rup main prakashit hui jiske peeche premchand ji kaa uddeshy us samay ke baalkon ke man main deshprem kii bhaavana jaagrit karnaa tha, jisamen ve purnat: safal hue
 The role of Durgadas, written by Premchand himself, is described in his words as follows - baalkon ke liye raashtra ke sapooton ke charitra se badhkar upyogi, sahitya kaa koi doosraa ang nahin he
 In this, his character is not only strong, he also has the love of the nation and his courage
 raajapootaana main bade-bade shoorveer ho gayi hai
 The desert has given birth to many male-gems, but Veer Durgadas is similar to Cohanoor for his unmatched self-sacrifice, his selfless devotion and his bright character
 auron main shaury ke saath kahin-kahin hinsa or dwesh kaa bhav bhi paaya jayega, kirti kaa moh bhi hoga, abhimaan bhi hoga, par durgadas shur hokar bhi sadhu purush the
 For these reasons, we have put the character of Veer Ratna Durgadas in front of the children
 hamane cheshtaa kii he ki pustak kii bhashaa saral or bamuhaavara ho or usamen baalkon kii ruchi utpann ho
 -premand isse unke uddeshy kaa pataa chalata he
 Premchand's stories and novels contain the genre of passages and the orderliness and disillusionment, the readers are familiar with it and their creations have passed the examination of the readers

 Its wayward use is also seen in 'durgadas'
 durgadas upanyaas ek satya katha he jiske paatr tathaa sthaan bhugolic tathaa aitihaasik rup se darshaae gaye hai
 Durgadas and Jaskaran, sons of Ashakaran, the gallant general of Jodhpur, were Jaskaran
 After the death of Ashakaran by deceit in 1605, Maharaj Yashwant Singh raised Durgadas and his son Prithvi Singh from Lad
 aurangzeb ke kehanen par maharaj dackhin kii subedari par chale gaye, durgadas ko saath liya or prithvisingh ko rajya main chhod diya
 After Yashwant Singh's friendship with Deccan king Shivaji, the Mughals became safe there
 phir aurangzeb ne raja ko kabul bheja tathaa vahaan ke musalamaanon se ladate hue do rajkumaar maare gaye
 From there, Aurangzeb also killed Prithvi Singh from Delhi and killed him
 or marwar par kabja kar liya
 Here, Jaswant Singh also died due to the death of children
 raja nen marane se pehle kaha tha ki unki do patni bhaati or hadi garbh se thim tathaa vah unhi ke santan ko raja bananaa chaahate the
 Except the two queens with the king, all became sati
 rani kaa baccha paidaa hua jiskaa naam ajit rakhaa gaya, duusare din hadi kaa bhi baccha paidaa hua jiskaa naam dalthambhan rakhaa
 On his way to Delhi, Daltambhan was killed by cold, there Aurangzeb said to keep Prince Ajit in Delhi
 durgadas nen aanandadaas khechi ke saath rajkumaar ko dugaba naamak gaanv main jayadev brahman ke ghar bhej diya
 Aurangzeb sent Kotwal and both queens committed suicide
 ladaai main jo bache the ve durgadas ke saanth raniyon kaa shav lekar chale or abu kii pahadiyon main dah kriya kii
 Everybody went to the Brahmin and after a day everyone went to Kalyangarh Durgadas's house where Durgadas's old mother and his brother Jaskaran and his son were Tejkaran
 badshaah nen jaswantsih ke bhattije ke kehane par yah farmaan jari kiya ki saare rajputon ko jinda yaa murda pakad ke lao
 All the Rajputs ran away, here Durgadas went to Awangarh with Sonningi, there, Shoningi said with a sarcophagus, "this is given by the king, i cannot protect it, you take it and give it to the young man who becomes king in Jodhpur, open it
" Do not! " durgadas us sandukchi ko lekar chalaa gaya
 On the way, two Rajputs were surrounded by Mughal soldiers, one of whom died and was injured as Mahasingh
 unhe bachaate hue durgadas nen joravar ko maar daalaa or mahasingh ko saath le apane ghar pahunchaa
 As soon as dawn, Durgadas took leave with his son and brother from his mother and gave the sandukchi to his servant Nathu
 unke jane ke baad shamsher khan aayaa or durgadas kii maan ko berahami se maar daalaa shamsher ke ek sainik khudabaksh ke sang mahansih maado chale gaye or nathu durgadas ko maan kii maut kii khabar dene chalaa gaya
 Durgadas became enraged by the death of mother and went straight to death Shamsher Khan
 isi prakaar kai mahaan kaam karte hue usne aurangzeb ko marwar se bhaga diya
 Now Durgadas had grown old, he put Ajitsingh on the throne, Ajit Singh came in arrogance and tried to kill Durgadas, but finally he also knew what he could do to fear that Aurangzeb escaped
 vir durgadas jodhpur se chale gaye or thode din rana jaisingh ke yahan rahe or phir ujjain chale gaye, bache dinon main shraddha se mahakaleshwar kii puja kii
 He died in the year 1765
 vir durgadas rathod kii mrityu to ho gai parantu unki virgatha sadaa ke liye amar rahegi
 In the end, Premchand writes that he killed Yashwant Singh's son and made him the lord of the Marwar country, today the dead body of the same hero was consumed in the pyre of the dry tamarisk of the river Kshipra

 Through its various services, Google receives several hundred million different queries per day

 Google search was originally developed in 1997 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin
 google khoj mul shabd khoj kshamta se pare kam se kam 22 vishesh suvidhaayen pradaan karata he
 These include synonyms, weather forecasts, time zones, stock quotes, maps, earthquake data, movie showtimes, airports, home listings, and sports scores

 The order of search results on Google's search results pages) is based in part on a priority rank called a "pagerank"
 prathagat khoj ke liye google khoj bulian operataron ke upyog: jaise: apvarjan, shaamil kiye jane, vikalp or wildcard ke jariye kai tarah ke vikalp pradaan karata he
 a large part of Google's success is due to a patented algorithm called page rank, which matches the search formula to rank web pages
 khoj ke parinaamon kii ranking kii pehle kii mukhya shabd aadhaarit paddati, jiskaa upyog kai khoj injanon main kiya gaya, kabhi google kii tulana main zyada lokapriy thi, vah pejon kii rank is aadhaar par tay karti thi ki kitni baar prishth main khoj ke shabd ko doharaaya gaya he yaa kitni majbootee se khoj ke shabd prayek parinamswaroop prishth ke bheetar jude hue hai
 The Page Rank algorithm instead analyzes human-generated links, assuming that web pages associated with many important pages can themselves be important
 elgorithm pejon ke liye punaravarti score kii gananaa karata he or yah unase jude pannon kii pej rank ke tulit jod par aadhaarit he
 Page rank can be considered to be a good correlate of concepts of human importance

 Their details are kept secret to avoid spammers and to retain an edge over Google's competitors
 google dwaara anukramit web pejon ke sateek pratishat gyaat nahin he, kyonki vastav main gananaa bahut mushkil he
 Google not only indexes and secretly stores web pages, but also captures "snapshots" of other types of files, including pdfs, Word content, Excel spreadsheets, Flash swfs, plain text files, and others

 Since Google is the most popular search engine, many webmasters have become eager to influence the Google ranking of their websites

 This field, called search engine optimization, attempts to detect patterns in search engine listings and then develops a methodology to improve rankings by attracting more searchers to its client's sites
 khoj ingine anukulan main "on pej" karkon or of pej anukulan kaarak, donon shaamil hote hai
 a common idea to influence Google's contextual algorithm is to "include keywords targeted to different pages on the page, especially in the title element and body copy xxrep 4 
 More keywords are found, although Google's spam The test algorithm causes the suspect to be suspicious
 google ne website swaamiyon ke liye dishanirdesh prakashit kiye hai, jo vaid anukulan salaahkaaron kaa upyog kar apni ranking badha sakate hai
 Google search involves a series of localized websites
 unamem se sabase adhik upyog kii jane vaali site google

 Some of its features include a dictionary link to more searches by including dictionary words

 Google's search engine generally accepts a simple text and places the user's text in a sequence of word searches, which will usually be words that come as a result, but no bullion operators: such as for an idiom The quotation mark can also use a prefix "+", "-" or one of several advanced operators, such as "site", for a qualified word

 sabhi unnat prashn aamtaur par atirikt yogya shabdon ke rup main niyamit prashnon main badal jate hai
 Google applies the query extension to the search query presented and changes it to a question that will actually be used to retrieve the results
 With page ranking, Google deliberately hides the exact details of the algorithm, but they certainly include the following changes: google ke hompej par "main saubhagyashaalee mahasoos kar rahaa hum" label laga ek batan shaamil hai
 When the user clicks on the button, the user will be taken directly to the first search result, bypassing the search engine's result page
 It entails the idea that if a user "feels lucky", the search engine will return to the exact match for the first time without the page being accessed through search results
 According to a study by Tom Chavez of "rapt", Google spends $ 110 million annually on this feature, because 1% of all searchers use the feature and they ignore all ads
 30 oktober 2009 ko kuch upyogkartaaon ke liye "main bhaagyashaalee mahasoos kar rahaa hum" batan niyamit khoj batan ke saath google ke mukhya prishth se hataa diya gaya tha
 In place of both buttons, it was written that "this space is intentionally left blank

 travel agency ek khudara vyapaar he, jisame aapurtikartaaon kii ore se graahakon ko yatra sambandhit utpaada or sevaayen bechin jaati hai, jaise airline, car kiraye par lenaa, krooj line, hotel, rail, darshneey sthalon kaa bhraman or chhuttiyon kaa package, jo kai utpaadon ko aapas main jodti he

 As the name implies, the main function of a travel agency is to act like an agent, such as selling services and travel related products on behalf of the supplier
 Consequently, like other retail businesses, they do not stock any goods
 ek chuttee package yaa ek tikat ko aapurtikartao se nahin kharidte he jab tak ki graahak kharidne kaa anurodh na kare
 chuttee yaa tikat par unhen chhot pradaan kii jaati he
 Hence profit is the difference between the advertised price, which the customer pays and the discounted price at which it gets to the agent
 yah kamishan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 a British travel agent considers a 10-12% commission as good
 australia main, sabhi vyakti yaa companiyaan jo tikat bechati hai unhen yatra agent ke rup main license praapt karnaa aavashyak he
 In some countries, airlines have stopped paying commissions to travel agencies
 isliye, travel agenciyaan ab premium pratishat yaa prati bikri par maanak nishchit shulk lene par majaboor hai
 However, some companies still give them a set percentage to sell their products
 pramukh tour companiyaan yah kar sakati he, kyonki ucch dar par sau yatraaen bechney kii bajaae hajaaron yatraaon ko ek sasti dar par bechney se unhen behatar munafa miltaa he
 This process benefits both parties
 vishesh rup se badi shrinkhalaa kii agenciyon dwaara anya vanijyik gatividhiyaan bhi sanchalit kii jaati hai
 These can include in-house insurance, travel guide books and timetables, car sales on rent, and also provide the most popular holiday len deen services in foreign currencies on the spot

 kai british or america agenciyaan or tour oparator international air transport association, jo unke liye air tikat jari karte he, air yatra aayojakon licencing, jinke liye tikat order kii jaati he, british agenton kii association yaa travel agenton kii amareeki sosayadi, unke liye jo tour company ke aadhaar par chhuttiyon kaa package bechate hai, ke saath anubandhit hai
 a travel agent is considered to provide unbiased travel advice to the customer
 haalanki, yah kaary lagbhag jan-saadhaaran package ke saath gaayab ho gaya or kuch agency shrankhlaon ne 'chuttee supermarket' avadharana ko viksit kiya he, jisamen graahak rack par broshar se apni chuttee chunate hai or phir counter se yah book karaate he
 Since the arrival of many inexpensive airlines, many social and economic changes have brought this aspect to the fore again
 adhikansh travel agenciyaan kamishan ke aadhaar par sanchalit he, jiskaa arth he ki vimaan seva, car kiraye par lene, krooj line, hotel, railway, darshneey sthalon kaa bhraman or tour operataron aadi kii booking se hone vaali unki kamai kamishan ke rup main hoti he
 Often, commission is a defined percentage of sales
 sanyukt rajya america main zyaadaatar airline yatra agenciyon ko kamishan kaa koi bhugtan nahin karti hai
 In this case, the agency usually adds service charges to the net worth
 britain main teen vibhinn prakaar kii agenciyaan he: vrihad, laghu or swatantra agenciyaan
 pehle prakaar kii agenciyon main adhiktar antarrashtriya swaamitv vaali anek rashtriya shrankhlaayen hai, jaise ki thomson holidays jo ki ab german bahurashtriya TUI AG kaa ek hissaa he
 It is now quite common for large-scale companies to buy a controlling stake in a chain of travel agencies, so that they can control their product distribution
 urdhwadhar ekikaran 
 choti shrinkhlaayein aksar vishesh kshetron yaa jilon main aadhaarit hoti hai
 There are four distinct types of agencies in the United States: Giant, regional, faculty, and independent agencies
 American Express and the American Automobile Association are examples of giant agencies
 swatantra agenciyaan aamtaur par ek vishesh yaa up bazaar ko seva pradaan karti hai, jaise ki ek rais ilaake main rahane waalon, ek upnagareey samooh vishesh, ek ruchi ke nivaasiyon kii jarurat jaise footbal, tennis, golf ghatnaon yaa anya khelon ke rup main, yaa is tarah kii gatividhi ko puraa karne ke liye
 Travel agencies have two approaches
 ek paramparaagat, bahu-sthaliy, baahar jane vaali travel agency yatri ke udbhav sthaan or anya par aadhaarit he or duusari yatra agency gantavy sthaan kendrit, aane vaale yatra agency or us gantavy sthaan kii apni visheshgyata par aadhaarit he
 Currently, the first class is usually that of the large operator Thomas Cook, while the second class is often that of a small, independent operator
 airline samekankarta or anya yatra samekankarta or thok vikreta ucch maatra main bikri karne vaali companiyaan hai jo up bazaar main bikri karne main visheshgy he
 They may or may not offer services of different types or uses at the same center
 For example, it can be hotel reservations, flights or car rentals
 kabhi kabhi sevaaon ko chuttee package main shaamil kiya jaataa he, jaise gantavy tak le janaa or asthaayee awaas kii vyavastha
 These companies generally do not sell directly to the public, but act as wholesalers for retail travel agencies
 saamanytah, samekankarta kaa ekmaatr uddeshy yatra udyog main sambandhit up bazaaron ke liye bikri karnaa he
 Typically, no consolidator offers everything, they can only offer contracted rates for specific sites
 aaj vyapaarik varg ke anubandhon ke kuch apwaad chhod kar koi gharelu samekankarta nahin he
 Travel agencies are accused of running a number of restrictive practices, the most prominent of which is 'racking'
 It is customary to display on their racks only the holiday brochures of travel companies they want to sell and who pay them the most commissions
 beshak, ausat graahak ko lagata he ki keval yahi chhuttiyaan uplabdh hai or vah anya sambhav vikalpon se anjaan rahata he
 Conversely, by limiting the number of companies the travel agency represents, it can create a better and more profitable relationship between the agency and its suppliers
 travel agenciyon phir apane graahakon ke liye unki booking par dhyaan kendrit karke ek saplir se vishesh laabh praapt kara sakati hai
 Some examples of these special benefits are fee waiver and fee waiver for shifting or changing room in a high-quality room
 aam janata dwaara internet ke badhate upyog ke saath kai vimaan sevaaon or anya yatra companiyon ne yatriyon ko sidhe bechney kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 As a result, airlines no longer need to pay commissions to the travel agent on each sold ticket
 1997 ke baad se kharchon ke ghatane ke kaaran travel agenciyon main dhire dhire bichauliyon kii chatni ho rahi he or chuttee package vitaran kii aupchaariktaaon main kami aa rahi he
 However, travel agents remain dominant in some areas such as cruise holidays where they represent 77% of bookings and 73% of reservations for package travel
 jawaab main, travel agenciyon ne internet par apni upasthiti banane ke liye apni yatra website viksit kii hai jin par vistrut jaankaree or online booking kii suvidha he
 Several major online travel agencies include: Priceline, cheapoair, Houtwire
com, Chiptikatz, Expedia, voyages-sncf
com, Travelocity and Orbit
 Travel agencies also use computer reservation system companies, also known as global delivery systems, including: Saber, Amadeus CRS, Galileo CRS, and worldspan, a company subordinate to Travelport from which they are offered airline tickets
 Is, helps to reserve and sell hotels, car rental and other travel related services
 kuch online yatra website aagantukon ko muft main kai companiyon ke saath hotel or udaan daron kii tulana karne kii anumati detii he
 They often allow visitors to make travel choices based on amenities, price, and proximity to a city or landmark
 travel agent gatisheel packaging sadhano ke jariye puri tarah se paripurna us daam par yaa usase bhi sasti yatra uplabdh karaate hai, jis daam par ek aam aadmi online aarakshan ke jariye paa saktaa he
 In this way the financial assets of the agencies are protected with the advice of a professional travel agency
 sabhi yatra citen jo ki online hotel booking kaa kaam karti hai jidies, aapurtikartaaon or hotel ke saath sidhe kamare main suchi ke liye khoj karti hai
 Once the travel site sells a hotel booking, the site tries to get confirmation from this hotel
 chaahe pushti ho yaa nahin, graahak ko parinaam ke saath sampark kiya jaataa he
 This means that booking on a travel website is not necessarily an immediate answer
 Only a few hotels can be confirmed instantly on a travel website
 Since separate travel websites work closely with different suppliers, each site has different hotels that they can quickly confirm
 online yatra web citen, jo is tarah hotel ke kamare arakshit karatin hai, ke kuch udhaaharan he: worldhotal-link, expedia or orbits
 Comparison sites such as Kayak
com, tripadvisor and sidestep search resale sites to save time
 in citon main se koi bhi vastav main hotel ke kamare nahin bechatin hai
 Tour operators often have permission to sell hotel contracts, allocate and sell for free, allowing them instant confirmation of hotel rooms
 mukhya seva pradaata ve hai, jo vastav main pratyaksh seva utpaadan kar rahe hai or online booking ke liye unki ek website bhi he, jaise ki vibhinn hotel shrankhlaayein yaa airlines
 Now that many people are trending towards self-service internet websites, the number of jobs available as travel agents is decreasing
 adhikansh naukariyaan buudhe travel agenton ke sevanivrutt hone ke kaaran milti hai
 The decrease in jobs due to Internet services is complemented by the increase in the number of people traveling
 1995 ke baad se, kai travel agenton ne yah udyog chhod diya he or apekshaakrit kuch yuva logon ne vetan pratispardhaatmakataa kam hone ke kaaran is kshetra main pravesh kiya he
 However, others left a 'permanent' agency for home-based business to reduce expenses, and those who remain are promoting or aggressively promoting other travel products such as cruise lines and train travel to survive
 Have been successful in doing research and boosting their capacity to create and deliver a complex travel package in an instant, essentially a convenience By acting like Rduttkrta
 kuch companiyaan malwahak vimaan seva or malwahak jahaaj ke saath bhi kaam karti he

 Another commonly stated theory is that entrepreneurs emerge from the population by combining opportunities and opportunities to take advantage of people when there is demand
 ek udhyami yah maan saktaa he kii ve un kuch logon main se ek hai jo samasya ko pahchaan sakane yaa hal karne main sakasham hai
 Keeping this in mind, one studies the distribution of one-way information about prospective entrepreneurs and on the other how environmental factors can change the productivity rate of entrepreneurs by society

 Common lifestyle goals held by entrepreneurs include earning a living doing something that they love, a way to earn a living in a self-employment facility, a good job / life without the remaining shareholders and a business owner
 To achieve
 Many entrepreneurs are very dedicated to their business lifestyles and can work within creative industries or the tourism industry, where a passion before profit approach to entrepreneurship often prevails
 jabaki kai udhyamiyon ek spasht baahar nikalen ranneeti ke saath apane vyapaar shuru kar sakate hai, ek jivan style udhyami jaanboojhkar or jaanboojhkar apane swayan ke niyantran ke bheetar apni puri udhyam rakhana chun sakate hai
