 In non-euclidean geometry, squares are more generally polygons with 4 equal sides and equal angles
 In spherical geometry, a square is a polygon whose edges are great circle arcs of equal distance, which meet at equal angles
 Unlike the square of plane geometry, the angles of such a square are larger than a right angle
 In hyperbolic geometry, squares with right angles do not exist
 Rather, squares in hyperbolic geometry have angles of less than right angles
 Larger squares have smaller angles

" The imagination was first conceived by Mr
 Charles Karl Bonny in the summer of 1889

 Says Haughton, "his meetings used to be so numerous and so elaborate were his activities that a 160-page amusing book of his programs was printed
" ’’ Among these meetings, Dharm-sabha gained the most fame and it was announced in the most elaborate amount
 shri baroj ‘‘vishwadharm-mahasabha’’ main likhte hai ‘iske purv aisi jansabha kabhi ekatrit nahin hui thi
 


 which was so eagerly awaited globally

 It is true that meetings of various religions have been held everywhere in Indian history, and it is also true that religious gatherings of Christians and Muslims were held from time to time before 1893 AD
 parantu yatharthat: yah kaha ja saktaa he ki purvakaal main kabhi bhi duniya ke mahanatam dharmon ke pratinidhiyon ko aise kisi ek sthaan par ekatrit nahin kiya ja sakaa tha, jahaan ve apane-apane dharmik vishwaason par nirbhay hokar hajaaron manushyon ke samaj kah saken
 It was an incomparable gathering, and in those days of intolerance and materialism, when it was first proposed, to many it seemed incurable to humans

 No matter what the divine law may be, but the human motives behind this organization were mixed
 swamiji ke baad ke apane patr main likhaa he: ‘‘isai dharm kaa anya sabhi dharmik vishwaason ke upar varchasv sabit karne hetu hi vishwa dharm-mahasabha kaa sanghathan kiya gaya tha

 "and again, during an interview, he said," It seems to me that this organization of the world-religion-general Assembly has happened before the world to make fun of the Evilites
 ’’ His belief about the Sarvadharma-sabha that introduced Swamiji to the western world is not justified in anyone's view
 parantu sabha kii taiyaariyon evam kriyakalapon kaa yadi adhyayan kiya jaae to kisi ko isamen leshmaatr bhi shankaa nahin rah jaaegi ki yah aayojan sarvatra isai abhimaan se hi vyaapt tha
 Christianity would proudly and invariably prove its superiority, this certain former belief had become many of its founders

 For such people, it was an unprecedented opportunity to promote mutual understanding and harmony with truthful people

 The sweet scholar tolerant Mr
 Bonny whose soul spoke through his bright eyes
 

 Bonnie himself has described his dream about what will be achieved by the Synod: xxrep 5

 do morche to isiyat or islam ke the kintu teesraa morcha sanatandharmee hinduon kaa tha, jinase jujhane main swami ji ko anek apmaan, kalank or ksht jhelane pade
 There was no response to the torch lit by Dayanand
 ve jo kuch kah rahe the, uskaa uttar na to musalmaan de sakate the, na isai, na puraanon par palane vaale hindu pandit or vidwaan
 Hindu Navothan had now come into full light and many sensible people started to feel in their mind that in fact there is no essence in the Pongapanthi of mythological religion
 swamiji prachlit dharmon main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa kadaa khandan karte the chaahe vah sanathan dharm ho yaa islam ho yaa isai dharm ho
 In his Mahagranth Satyarth Prakash, Swamiji has denied the evils prevailing in all opinions
 unke samakaleen sudhaarkon se alag, swamiji kaa mat shikshit varg tak hi simit nahin tha apitu arya samaaj ne aryaavart ke saadhaaran janamanas ko bhi apni ore aakarshith kiya
 In 1872, Swamiji came to Calcutta
 vahaan devendranath thakur or keshavachandra sen ne unka bada satkar kiya
 He also had discussions with Brahmo Samajis, but Brahmo Samaj scholars influenced by Christianity could not agree with Swami regarding the rebirth and authenticity of Veda
 kehete hai kalkatte main hi keshavachandra sen ne swami ji ko yah salaah de daali ki yadi aap sanskrit chhod kar aryabhasha main bolnaa armbh karen, to desh kaa aseem upkaar ho saktaa he
 Since then, the language of Swami Ji's lectures became Aryabhasha and he started to have a lot of followers in the Aryan speaking provinces
 kalkatte se swami ji mumbai padhaare or vahiin 10 april 1875 i
 ko unhone 'arya samaaj' kii sthapana kii
 Prayer community also discussed with him in Mumbai
 kintu yah samaaj to brahmo samaaj kaa hi mumbai sanskaran tha
 Therefore, even the people of this society could not agree with Swami ji
 mumbai se laut kar swami ji indraprastha aae
 There he called a meeting of Christian, Muslim and Hindu priests for Satyansandha
 kintu do dinon ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bhi log kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake
 Swamiji went to Punjab from Indraprastha
 punjab main unke prati bahut utsaah jaagrath hua or saare praant main aryasamaj kii shakhaaen khulne lageen
 Since then, Punjab has been the principal stronghold of the Arya Samajis
 maharishi dayanand ne tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt saamaajik kuritiyon tathaa andhvishwaason or rudhiyon-buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye, nirbhay hokar un par akraman kiya
 They were called 'saints warriors'
 unhone janmana jati kaa virodh kiya tathaa karm ke aadhaar vedanukool varna-nirdhaaran kii baat kahi
 He was a supporter of Dalits
 unhone striyon kii shiksha ke liye prabal aandolan chalaaya
 He prohibited child marriage and sati and supported widow marriage
 unhone ishwar ko sristi kaa nimitt kaaran tathaa prakruti ko anadi tathaa shaashvat mana
 He was an advocate of oilism
 unke darshanik vichaar vedanukool the
 He also believed that the living beings are free to work and are free to enjoy the fruits
 maharishi dayanand sabhi dharmanuayiyon ko ek manch par laakar ekta sthapit karne ke liye prayatnsheel the
 He made such an effort in 1878 during the Indraprastha court
 unke amar granth satyarth prakaash, sanskaar vidhi or rigvedadi bhashya bhoomika main unke moulik vichaar suspasht rup main prapya hai
 He was a yogi and had special emphasis on pranayama
 ve saamaajik punargathan main sabhi varnon tathaa striyon kii bhagidaari ke pakshdhar the
 In the direction of national awakening, he adopted the path of social revolution and spiritual revival
 unki shiksha sambandhi dharanaon main pradarshit doordarshita, deshbhakti tathaa vyavhaarikta purnataya praasangik tathaa uganukool he
 Maharishi Dayanand was not only a social reformer and a pioneer of religious renaissance, he was also a great nationalist and political idealist
 videshiyon ke aryaavart main rajya hone ke kaaran aapas kii foot, matbhed, brahmacharya kaa seven na karnaa, vidhaan padhnaa-padhaana va baalyavastha main aswayamvaravivaah, vishayasakti, mithyaa bhashaavadi, kulakshan, veda-vidya kaa prachaar aadi kukarm hai, jab aapas main bhai-bhai ladte hai or tabhi teesraa videshi aakar panch ban baithta he
 He has also enumerated the qualifications required for the head of state and various councils and committees of government
 unhone nyaay kii vyavastha rishi pranit granthon ke aadhaar par kiye jane kaa paksh liya
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati is generally known only as the founder and social reformer of the Arya Samaj
 rashtriya swatantrata ke liye kiye gaye prayatnon main unki ullekhneey bhoomika kii jaankaree bahut kam logon ko he
 The fact is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had probably first dared to say that "aryavarta belongs to Aryavartis" in the subordinated Aryavarta
 hamaare pratham swatantrata samar, san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn yojana bhi swami ji ke netritv main hi taiyaar kii gai thi or vahi uske pramukh sutaradhar bhi the
 He often preached nationalism to the audience in his sermons and filled the spirit of dying for the country
 1855 main haridwar main jab kumbh mela laga tha to usamen shaamil hone ke liye swami ji ne abu parvat se haridwar tak paidal yatra kii thi
 On the way, he preached from place to place and explored the pulse of the countrymen
 unhone yah anubhav kiya ki log ab angrejon ke atyaachaari shashan se tang aa chuke hai or desh kii swatantrata ke liye sangharsh karne ko aatur ho uthe hai
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati reached Haridwar and camped in a solitary place on a hill there
 vahiin par unhone paanch aise vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii, jo aage chalakar san 1857 kii kranti ke karnadhaar bane
 These five persons were Nana Saheb, Azimullah Khan, Bala Saheb, Tatya Tope and Babu Kunwar Singh
 baatcheet kaaphi lambi chali or yaheen par yah tay kiya gaya ki firangi sarkaar ke viruddh sampoorn desh main sashastr kranti ke liye aadharbhumi taiyaar kii jaae or uske baad ek nishchit din sampoorn desh main ek saath kranti kaa bigul baja diya jaae
 a plan of 'roti Aur Kamal' was also prepared to spread the voice of this revolution among the general public and Aryavartiya soldiers
 is sampoorn vichaar vimarsh main pramukh bhoomika swami dayanand saraswati kii hi thi
 After discussion and planning, Swamiji stopped in Haridwar and the other five national leaders went to their respective places to give realization to the plan
 unke jane ke baad swami ji ne apane kuch vishwast sadhu sanyasiyon se sampark sthapit kiya or unka ek gupt sanghathan banaaya
 The headquarters of this organization was built at the Yogmaya temple at Mehrauli in Indraprastha
 is mukhyalay ne swadhinata samar main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai
 Under the leadership of Swamiji, sadhus also awakened the revolution throughout the country
 ve krantikariyon ke sandesh ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaate, unhen protsaahit karte or aavashyaktaa padane par swayan bhi hathiyaar uthaakar angrejon se sangharsh karte
 During the entire period of the revolution of 1857, the national leader, Swami Dayanand Saraswati remained in constant contact
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa par bhi swami ji niraash nahin the
 He was already aware of the fact that freedom cannot be attained only by trying once
 iske liye to sangharsh kii lambi prakriya chalaani hogi
 At the 1855 meeting in Haridwar itself, when Babu Kunwar Singh asked Swamiji about the possibility of success in this struggle, his answer was "the freedom struggle never fails
" bharat dhire-dhire ek sau varsh main paratantra bana he
 Now it will take one hundred years to become independent as well
 is swatantrata prapti main bahut se anmol praanon kii aahutiyaan daali jaaengi
 "how accurate Swami Ji's prediction turned out to be, was confirmed by subsequent events
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa ke baad jab tathya tope, naanaa sahab tathaa anya rashtriya netaa swami ji se mili to unhen bhi unhone niraash na hone tathaa uchit samay kii pratiksha karne kii hi salaah di
 Two years after the revolution of 1857, Swamiji made Swami Virjanand his guru and took initiation from him
 swami virajanand ke ashram main rahakar unhone vedon kaa adhyayan kiya, un par chintan kiya or uske baad apane guru ke nirdeshaanusaar ve vaidic gyaan ke prachaar-prasar main jute gaye
 To achieve this objective, he also founded the Arya Samaj and through it did many works of social improvement
 chuaachhut, sati pratha, bal vivaah, nar bali, dharmik sankeernata tathaa andhvishwaason ke viruddh unhone jamkar prachaar kiya or vidhwaa vivaah, dharmik udaartaa tathaa aapasi bhaichaare kaa unhone samarthan kiya
 Along with all this, Swamiji never failed to fill the spirit of patriotism among the people
 prarambh main anek vyaktiyon ne swami ji ke samaaj sudhaar ke kaaryon main vibhinn prakaar ke vighn daale or unka virodh kiya
 Gradually, his arguments started coming to the understanding of the people and the opposition decreased
 unki lokapriyata nirantar badhane lagi
 This led to a desire in the minds of British officials that if they were made in favor of the British Government, then through them, the British could be popularized in the general public
 isse purv angrej adhikari isi prakaar se anya kuch dharmopadeshkon tathaa dharmadhikariyon ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan dekar apni taraf mila chuke the
 He also considered Swami Dayanand Saraswati like him
 tadnusaar ek isai padri ke madhyam se swami ji kii tatkaaleen governor general lord northbrook se mulaakaat karavaayi gai
 The meeting took place in Calcutta in March 1873
 idhar-udhar kii kuch aupchaarik baton ke uparant lord northbrook ne vinamrata se apni baat swami ji ke saamne rakhi- "apane vyaakhyaan ke prarambh main aap jo ishwar kii prarthana karte hai, kya usamen aap angreji sarkaar ke kalyaan kii bhi prarthana kar sakenge
 " garvanar general kii baat sunakar swami ji sahaj hi sab kuch samaj gaye
 He also felt pity for the intelligence of the British government, which could not understand him properly
 unhone nirbhikta or dridhtaa se governor general ko uttar diya- The Governor General did not expect such a sharp reply from Swamiji
 mulaakaat tatkaal samaapt kar di gai or swami ji vahaan se laut aae
 After this, the intelligence department of the government had a keen eye on Swami ji and his organization Arya Samaj
 unki prayek gatividhi or unke dwaara bole gaye prayek shabd kaa ricard rakhaa jane laga
 Due to their impact on the general public, the government began to realize that this rebel Fakir and Arya Samaj can become a threat to the government any day
 isliye swami ji ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi tarah-tarah ke shadyantr rache jane lage
 The circumstances under which Swamiji died, give the same impression that there was definitely a conspiracy of the English government in it
 swami ji kii mrityu 30 oktober 1883 ko deepawali ke din sandhyaa ke samay hui thi
 In those days, he had gone to Jodhpur at the invitation of King Naresh Jaswant Singh
 vahaan unke nity hi pravachan hote the
 Sometimes Maharaja Jaswant Singh would also sit at his feet and listen to his sermons there
 do-chaar baar swami ji bhi rajya mehalon main gaye
 There he saw the unnecessary intervention of a prostitute named Nanhi and his immense influence on Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 swami ji ko yah bahut bura laga
 When he explained this to Maharaj, he politely accepted his word and broke the relationship with the little one
 isse nanheen swami ji ke bahut adhik viruddh ho gai
 He got Swami ji's cook Kalia alias Jagannath on his side and got the glass mixed in his milk
 thodi hi der baad swami ji ke paas aakar apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya or uske liye kshamaa maangi
 The benevolent-hearted Swami Ji gave him five hundred rupees for his living and living, so that the police would not disturb him
 baad main jab swami ji ko jodhpur ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya to vahaan sambandhit chikitsak bhi shaq ke daayre main rahaa
 He was accused of giving light poison to Swamiji in the name of medicine
 baad main jab swami ji kii tabiyat bahut kharaab hone lagi to unhen ajmer ke aspataal main laayaa gaya
 But by then there was a lot of delay
 swami ji ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 The apprehension in this entire incident is that the task of raising the prostitute and tricking the doctor was done by a British officer at the behest of the British government
 anyathaa ek saadhaaran veshya ke liye yah sambhav nahin tha ki keval apane balboote par swami dayanand saraswati jaise suprasiddh or lokapriy vyakti ke viruddh aisa shadyantr kar sake
 Without such encouragement and protection, even the doctor could not do this audacity
 swadharm, swabhaasha, swarashtra, swasamskruti or swadeshonnati ke agradoot swami dayanand ji kaa sharir san 1883 main deepawali ke din panchtatv main villin ho gaya or ve apane peeche chhod gaye ek siddhanth, krinvanto vishwamaryam - arthath saare sansar ko shreshth maanav banaao
 His last words were - "lord! You did well
 aapaki ichha purna ho
 " swami dayanand saraswati ne kai dharmik va saamaajik pustaken apni jivan kaal main likhin
 The early books were in Sanskrit, but over time he also wrote many books in Aryabhasa, because Aryabhasa had more reach than Sanskrit
 hindi ko unhone 'aryabhasha' kaa naam diya tha
 Swami Dayanand was the pioneer and early man who used the Aryabhasha for better writing
 swami dayanand saraswati kii mukhya kritiyaan nimnlikhit hai- In 1873, a book called Aryodeshyaratnamala was published in which Swamiji described the definition of one hundred words
 inamen se kai shabd aam bolchaal main aate hai par unke arth rutes ho gaye hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ishwar, dharm, karm, aadi
 They are defined and explained in this book
 is laghu pustika main 8 prishth hai
 In 1881, Swami Dayanand published a book called Gokrunanidhi which also takes credit for playing a major role in establishing the Goraksha movement
 is pustak main unhone sabhi samudaay ke logon ko apane pratinidhi sahit gokrishyaadi raksha samiti kii sadsyta lene ko kaha he jiskaa uddeshy pashu va krishi kii raksha he
 Like modern environmentalists, ideas have been made here
 is pustak main samiksha, niyam va upanium hai, tathaa pramukhtah pashuon ko na maar kar unka paalan karne main hone vaale laabh varnit kiye gaye hai
 The book Behavnabhanu was published in 1880 by the Vedic machinery, Banaras
 isamen dharmokt or uchit vyavhaar ke bare main varnan he
 On 27 February 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati in Udaipur published an acknowledgment in which he handed over the responsibility of philanthropy to 23 persons after his death, who could then carry on their work
 inamen mahadev govind rande kaa bhi naam he
 This acknowledgment is signed as a witness to 13 dignitaries
 iske prakaashan ke kuch chah maah pashchaat hi unka dehant ho gaya tha
 This is a small conversation book teaching Sanskrit
 vibhinn vishyon par laghu vaakya sanskrit main diye gayi hai
 Their meanings are also given in Hindi

 Wine production can be divided into two general categories: still wine production and sparkling wine production
 wine tathaa wine utpaadan ke vigyaan ko onology ke naam se janaa jaataa he 
 After harvesting the grapes are stored in a winery and prepared for early fermentation, at which stage the process of making red wine is separated from white wine
 red wine laal yaa kaale angoor ke must se banaaya jaataa he jise angoor ke chhilake ke saath fermentation ke liye bheja jaataa he
 White wine is prepared from fermenting juice for which the ground grapes are pressed and extracted from the juice; The peels are removed and have no other use
 kabhi-kabhi white wine ko laal angoor se banaaya jaataa he, iske liye angoor ke chhilkon kii kam se kam maatra ke saath inkaa ras nikaal liya jaataa he
 Rose wine is prepared from red grapes where the juice is kept in contact with darker peels for only so long that it can absorb its pink color but protect it from the tannins found in the peels
 praathmik fermentation kii prakriya shuru karne ke liye yeast ko red wine ke liye must yaa white wine ke liye zeus main milaayaa jaataa he
 During this fermentation, which often takes between one and two weeks, the yeast converts most of the sugars in grape juice into ethanol and carbon dioxide
 carbon dioxide vaataavaran main mil jaataa he
 After the primary fermentation of red grapes, the freely flowing wine is pumped into the tanks and the peels are pressed to remove the remaining juices and wines, the extracted wines being released as the wine makers wish
 Is mixed with the flowing wine
 wine ko garm rakhaa jaataa he or bachi hui sharkara wine or carbon dioxide main tabdeel ho jaati he
 The next process in preparing red wine is secondary fermentation
 yah ek jeevanu aadhaarit fermentation he jo mailic acid ko lactic acid main badal detii he
 This process reduces the amount of acid in the wine and lightens the taste of the wine
 kabhi-kabhi red wine ko paripakv hone ke liye kuch hafton yaa maheenon ke liye ok baralon main sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he, is upaay se ok kii gandh wine se alag ho jaati he
 Wines must be systematically arranged or cleaned before refining and bottling

 However, only 10% of all red wines and only 5% of white wines will taste better after five years than after only one year
 Depending on the quality of the grape and the style of the target wine, a particular wine manufacturer Some of these steps can be added or removed to accomplish the goal
 tulaneey gunvattta vaali kai vinon kaa utpaadan ek jaisi lekin unke utpaadan se vishesh rup se alag nazariye ke saath kiya jaataa he; gunvattta kaa nirdhaaran shuruaati saamagree kii visheshtaon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he or winification ke dauraan anivaary rup se uthaaye gaye kadamon ke aadhaar par nahin kiya jaataa he
 Variations are seen in the above process
 bulbuledaar vinon jaise ki shampagne ke maamle main bottle ke andar ek atirikt fermentation kii kriya hoti he jisamen carbon dioxide kii treping kii jaati he or vishesh prakaar ke bulbule banaae jate hai
 Sweet wine is prepared by ensuring that some residual sugars remain after the fermentation process is complete
 isko kataai ke samay main vilamb karke, sharkara ko sandrit karne ke liye angooron ko sheetalit karke yaa fermentation kii prakriya puri hone se pehle bachi hui khamir ko samaapt ke liye koi cheez milakar kiya ja saktaa he; udhaaharan ke liye, port wine taiyaar karte samay isamen hai pruf brandi milaayi jaati he
 In other cases wine makers may choose to preserve some portion of the sweet grape juice and mix it into the wine after the fermentation process is complete, a technique known as sucrose

 Harvest means harvesting grapes from plants and in many ways this is the first stage of wine production
 angooron ko yantric tareeke se yaa phir haath se todaa jaataa he
 The decision to obtain a grape crop is usually taken by wine makers and information about sugar levels, acids and ph of the grapes is obtained
 anya vichaarneey pahaluon main shaamil hai phinological paripakvata, beri flavor, tennic vikaas 
 angoor kii bel or mausam ke purvanumaan ke kii samast swabhaav ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he
 Mechanical harvesters are large tractors that are stacked in front of graffiti vines and then, using strong plastic or rubber rods, strike the grape vine's fruit areas so that the grapes are separated from the rakees
 
 yantric harvester kii yah visheshta hoti he ki ye angoor ke baag ke ek bade kshetra ko apekshaakrit kam samay main cover karte hai or harvest kiye gaye prayek ton main kamgaaron kii kam se kam sankhya lagaani padati he
 a disadvantage of mechanical harvesting is that the product contains indigenous non-grapevines, especially the leaves of the leaves and the leaves indiscriminately, but at the same time depending on the management of the Jaffrey system and grape vine canopies, it contains poor grapes, Can include canes, metal debris, rocks and even small animals and sparrows nests
 kuch wine nirmaataa harvest kiye gaye falon main is tarah kii chizon ke milane se rokane ke liye yantric harvesting se pehle angoor kii belon se pattiyon or khule malbon ko hataa lete hai
 Mechanical harvesting is rarely used in the United States to produce high-quality wines due to the indiscriminate harvesting of fruits and the over-oxidation of grape juice
 anya deshon saamaanya shramikon kii kami ke kaaran aam taur par premium winegraps kii yantric harvesting kaa upyog kahin adhik kiya jaataa he
 Manual harvesting refers to the breaking of grapes by hand from grape vines
 In the United States, grapes are traditionally plucked into 30-pound boxes and in many cases placed in half-ton or two-ton cartons to carry these boxes to the winery
 minial harvesting kaa faaydaa yah he ki isamen jaankaar shramikon kaa istemaal naa keval angoor ke pake hue gucchhon ko todane ke liye balki kachche gucchhon yaa jin gucchhon main sade hue angoor yaa anya doshauki gucchhon ko chhodane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 This can be the first effective safety measure to prevent a store or tank of wine from becoming contaminated with low quality fruit
 disteming ek aisi prakriya he jisamen angoor ke tanon ko angooron se alag kiya jaataa he
 This process is carried out before the grapes are grounded with the aim of reducing the growth of tannins in the wines and the flavor of the vegetation, depending on how the wine is made
 jaisaa ki kuch german trokenbirenouslij ke saath kiya jaataa he, single beri harvesting main is charan ko nazarandaaj kiya jaataa he or angooron ko ek-ek karke chunaa jaataa he
 Crushing is the process in which the berries are squeezed well and the peels are broken to begin the process of separating the elements of the berries
 disteming angoor ke rekis se angooron ko alag karne kii ek prakriya he
 Harvested grapes in traditional and small-scale wine making are sometimes crushed barefoot or grinded using inexpensive small-scale crushers
 saath hi saath inhen distem bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 However in large wineries a mechanical crusher / detemer is used
 red or white wine taiyaar karne ke liye disteming kaa nirnay alag-alag tareeke se liya jaataa he
 Generally, when making white wine, only the fruit is milled, after which the stems are placed in the press along with the berries
 mishran main tanon kii upasthiti ras ko pehle nikaale gaye chhilkon se hokar pravaahit kar dabaav daalane kii suvidha pradaan karti he
 They are deposited on the edge of the press
 red wine taiyaar karne ke liye angooron ke tanon ko aam taur par fermentation se pehle nikaal liya jaataa he kyonki tanon main tannin tatv kii maatra apekshaakrit zyada hoti he; tannin ke alaava ye wine ko ek vanaspatik gandh bhi de sakate hai kai baar jab angooron main swayan ummid se kam tannin kii maatra maujuud hoti he to wine nirmaataa inhen chhod dene kaa nirnay le sakate hai
 This becomes more acceptable when the stems are "ripe" and begin to turn brown
 agar adhik maatra main chhilake nikaalane kii jarurat hoti he to wine nirmaataa disteming ke baad angooron kii pisai kaa vikalp chun saktaa he
 Removal of stems first means stems of tannins cannot be removed
 in maamalon main angooron ko do roleron ke bich se guzaara jaataa he jo angooron ko itnaa nichod lete hai ki inke chhilake or pulp alag-alag ho jate hai lekin itnaa adhik bhi nahin ki chhilkon ke uttakon main jarurat se zyada tut-foot yaa kaat-chhaant ho jaae
 kuch maamalon main aanshik carbonic masoreshan ke jariye fal jaisi sugandh ko barkaraar rakhane ko protsaahit karne ke liye ullekhneey rup se "najuk" red veriatles jaise ki pinot noir yaa sira ke maamle main angooron ke puure yaa kuch hisse ko bagaiyr pisa hua chhod diya jaataa he 
 Most red wines derive their color from grape peels, and therefore, the contact between the juice and the peel is necessary to remove the color
 red wine angooron kii disteming or krashing kar ek tanks main taiyaar kii jaati he or fermentation kii sampoorn prakriya ke dauraan chhilkon ko ras ke sampark main rahane diya jaataa he
 White wine can be prepared from red grapes without putting too much pressure on the crushed fruits
 isse angoor ke ras or chhilkon ke bich sampark kam ho jaataa he Most white wines are prepared without decimating or crushing and are transferred directly from the lifting containers to the press
 aisa chhilkon yaa angoor ke bijon se kisi bhi tarah tannin ko nikalne se bachaane ke saath-saath khuli hui beriyon kii bajaay angoor ke gucchhon ke ek matrix ke jariye ras ke samuchit pravaah ko kaayam rakhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In some circumstances wine manufacturers may choose to grind white grapes for a short time, usually for three to 24 hours after exposure to peels
 isse chhilkon se jaayke or tannin ko nikaalane ke saath-saath potacium aayan ko nikaalane main madad milti he jo bitarteret avakshepan main bhaag lete hai
 As a result, the ph of the juice also increases, which may be desirable for very acidic grapes
 yah aaj kii tulana main 1970 ke dashak main ek aam upaay tha, haalanki abhi bhi california main kuch sovignon blonk or chardone utpaadakon dwaara is tareeke ko aajamaaya jaataa he
 In the case of rose wines, the fruit is crushed and the darker peels are allowed to remain in contact with the juice for as long as the color remains as the wine maker wants
 iske baad must ko dabaaya jaataa he or fermentation kii prakriya is tarah puri kii jaati he maano ki wine nirmaataa ek white wine taiyaar kar rahaa tha
 Yeast is already present on grapes, which often appears in the powdery form of grapes
 fermentation kii prakriya is prakritik khamir ke saath puri kii ja sakati he lekin chunki bilkul sateek kism ke maujuud khamir ke aadhaar par yah ek apratyaashit parinaam de saktaa he isiliye must ke saath aksar sanvardhit khamir ko milaayaa jaataa he
 a major problem with the use of wild ferments is the failure to complete the entire process of fermentation, where some residues of the sugar sugars remain without fermentation
 aise main jab dry wine praapt karnaa hota he to yah wine ko meetha bana saktaa he
 Constant wild fermentants can produce an unpleasant acetic acid as a by-product
 praathmik kinvan ke dauraan khamir kii koshikaayen must main maujuud sharkara par palati hai or isi kaaran carbon dioxide gas or alcohol kaa utpaadan kai guna bad jaataa he
 The temperature level during fermentation affects both the taste of the final product as well as the fermentation speed
 red wine ke liye taapmaana aam taur par 22 se 25 degree celsius tak or white wine ke liye 15 se 18 degree celsius tak hota he
 Half a gram of alcohol is prepared for each gram of sugar converted, so to achieve an alcohol concentration of 12%, there must be about 24% sugar content in the mast
 The percentage of sugars in the mast is calculated with the help of the measured density, weight of the mast and a specific type of hydrometer called a sacrometer
 agar angooron main sharkara kii maatra bahut hi kam hoti he jisase ki alcohol kii vaanchit pratishat maatra praapt nahin ho paati he to aise main chini milaai ja sakati he 
 vyavsaayik taur par wine taiyaar karne main chaptliseshan sthaneey viniyamon ke adheen he
 The process of melolactic fermentation is also completed during or after alcohol fermentation, during which specific strains of bacteria convert malic acid to relatively mild lactic acid
 is prakaar kaa fermentation aksar vaanchit bacteria ke tikon dwaara shuru kiya jaataa he
 Pressing is a process of pressurizing grapes or pomace in order to separate juices or wines from grapes or grape peels
 wine banane main pressing hameshaa ek aavashyak kaary nahin hota he, jab angooron kii pisai hoti he to ras ek paryaapt maatra main turant alag ho jaataa he jise winification ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally, it is of better quality than free-run juice extracted juice
 haalanki zyaadaatar wineriyaan apane prati ton utpaadan ko badhaane ke liye preson kaa upyog karti hai kyonki press se nikaala gaya ras angoor se nikaale gaye ras kii kul maatra ke 15%-30% kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he
 In the working of the press, grape peels or whole grape clumps are placed between a rigid fixed surface and a dynamic surface, and the volume between the two surfaces is gradually reduced
 aadhunik press prayek chakra press par lagane vaale samay or dabaav ko nirdhaarit karte hai jo aam taur par 0 baar se 2
0 ke bich niyantrit rahati he
 Sometimes wine makers choose a pressure that separates the flow of pressurized juice, which is called "press cut" preparation
 chunki dabaav chhilkon se nikle tannin kii maatra ko badha detaa he jisase ras main isaki maatra bad jaati he, isiliye press kiya gaya ras aksar bahut adhik tannic yaa kadak ho jaataa he
 Due to the position of the grape juice ingredients in the berry, the amount of acid in the pressed juice or wine is reduced and its ph value is higher than that of free-run juice
 aadhunik tareeke se wine utpaadan kii shuruyaat se pehle zyaadaatar press lakdi se bane basket press hote the or inhen haathon se sanchalit kiya jaataa tha
 Basket presses are made up of a cylinder of wooden slats on top of a fixed plate containing a movable plate that can be pushed downwards
 The press operator fills the grapes or pomace in a wooden cylinder, holds the upper plate in place and keeps it down until the juice starts to flow through the wood slats
 jab ras kaa pravaah kam ho jaataa he to plate ko ek baad phir rechet kar neeche laayaa jaataa he
 This process continues until the press operator decides that the quality of the pressed juice or wine has fallen below the standard level or that the entire juice has been pressurized
 1990 ke dashak kii shuruyaat se aitihaasik basket preson kii acchhee tarah pressing ko dohraane kii chaah main ucchstareey-antim utpaadakon ke jariye aadhunik yantric basket preson ko punerjeevit kiya gaya he
 Because basket presses are of a relatively compact design, the press cake provides a relatively long passage for the juice to flow before it leaves the press
 basket press kii vakaalat karne waalon kaa yah maananaa he ki angoor yaa pomas kek se hokar guzarane vaala yah apekshaakrit lanbaa maarg un thos padaarthon ke liye ek filter ke rup main kaary karata he jo anyathaa press zeus kii gunvattta ko prabhavit karte hai
 In the case of red wine, after primary fermentation the mast is pressurized which separates the shells or other solids from the solution
 white wine kii sthiti main ghol ko kinvan se pehle must se alag kar liya jaataa he
 In the case of rose wine, the peels are allowed to come into contact with it for a short period to give the wine its color, in which case the mast can also be pressed
 wine ko kuch samay tak rakhane yaa purana hone dene ke baad, wine ko mrit khamir or bache hue kisi bhi thos padaarth se alag kar liya jaataa he or ise ek nae container main sthanantarit kar diya jaataa he jahaan fermentation kii atirikt prakriyaaon ko puraa kiya ja sake
 Piezage is a French term for wine production for the traditional stomping of grapes in open fermentation tanks
 kuch vishesh prakaar kaa wine taiyaar karne ke liye angooron ko ek krashar main daalkar chalaaya jaataa he or uske baad is ras ko khule kinvan tinkon main nikaal liya jaataa he
 Once fermentation begins, the grape peels are pushed towards the surface by the carbon dioxide gases released in the fermentation process
 chhilkon or anya thos padaarthon kii is parat ko cap ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 As the peels are the source of tannins, the cap is mixed daily in the slurry or traditionally "punched" by stomping through VAT
 sheet sthirikaran ek aisi prakriya he jiskaa upyog wine banaate samay wine se tartrate crystalon ko kam karne main kiya jaataa he
 These tartrate crystals look like clear particles of sand and are also known as "wine crystals" or wine "diamonds"
 inkaa nirmaan tarteric amla or potacium potacium ke sanyog se hota he or ye wine main talachat ke rup main dikhaai dete hai haalanki ye talachat nahin hote hai
 The temperature of the wine is dropped to the freezing point for 1-2 weeks during the cold stabilization process after fermentation
 isse crystal wine se alag ho jate hai or paatr ke kinaaron se chipak jate hai
 When the wine is extracted from the container, the tartrate remains in the container
 inkaa nirmaan un wine kii botalon main bhi ho saktaa he jinka bhandaaran atyant thandi paristhitiyon main kiya gaya ho
 During "heat stabilization" the volatile proteins are absorbed and dissociated into bentonite, thus preventing them from precipitating into the bottled wine
 dwitiyak kinvan or paripakvan prakriya ke dauraan, jisamen teen se chah maheene lagate hai, kinvan kii prakriya bahut dhire-dhire jari rahati he
 The wine is stored in an airtight to protect the wine from oxidation
 angooron ke proteinon kaa vikhandan hota he or shesh khamir koshikaon evam duusare maheen kanon ko talachat main baithne diya jaataa he
 Potassium bitartrate will also sit in the sediment, the process can be further enhanced by cold stabilization to prevent tartrate crystals from appearing after bottling
 in prakriyaaon kaa parinaam yah hota he ki dhundhlee wine saafe dikhne lagati he
 The wine can also be squeezed during this process to remove the scum
 dwitiyak kinvan aam taur par yaa to kai ghan meter aaytan vaale jangrodhi steel ke bartanon main yaa ok ke baralon main hota he, yah wine utpaadak ke uddeshyon par nirbhar karata he
 Wine without oak is fermented in barrels of stainless steel or other substances that have no effect on the final taste of the wine
 Depending on the desired taste, it can be fermented in stainless steel and kept in oak for a short time or the entire fermentation can be done in a stainless steel vessel
 puri tarah se lakdi ke baralon kii bajaay gair-lakdi ke bairal main ok kii chippiyon ko milaayaa ja saktaa he
 This process is mainly used in inexpensive wines shaukia wine banane vaale aksar wine utpaadan ke liye shishe kii badi botalon kaa istemaal karte hai; in botalon kii kshamta 4
5 se 54 litre tak hoti he
 The type of vessel used depends on the quantity of wine produced, the grapes used, and the intentions of the wine maker
 melolactic kinvan tab hota he jab lactic amla ke jeevanu mailic amla ko upaapachay kar lactic amla or carbon dioxide banaate hai
 This action is either voluntarily carried out in which a species of specially cultured bacteria is added to the maturing wine, or it may also be incidental if bacteria of unrelated lactic acid are already present
 melolactic kinvan us wine ke swaad ko behatar bana saktaa he jisamen mailic amla kaa str adhik ho kyonki mailic amla kii adhik sandratha aam taur par aruchikar or tikhe swaad ke ehsaas kii vajah banati he, jabaki lactic amla adhik halkaa or kam tikhaa mana jaataa he
 This process is mostly used in red wine while in white wine it is discretionary
 wine chaahe tinkon main paripakv ho rahi ho yaa baralon main, wine kii sthiti jaanane ke liye samay-samay par prayogshaala me pareekshan kiye jate hai
 Common tests include ° brix, ph, titratable acidity, residual sugars, free or available sulfur, total sulfur, vapor acidity, and alcohol percentage
 atirikt pareekshanon main tarter ke kriim kaa crystaleekaran or taap asthir protein kaa avakshepan shaamil he, yah antim pareekshan keval white vinon tak hi simit he
 These tests are often performed throughout the wine making period and even before bottling
 in pareekshanon ke parinaamon kii pratikriya main tab wine nirmaataa sahi upachaar prakriya ke bare main nirnay le saktaa he, udhaaharan ke liye adhik maatra main sulfur dioxide ko milaanaa
samvedi pareekshan bhi kiye jate hai or phir inke aadhaar par wine nirmaataa upachaaratmak kadam uthaa saktaa he jaise kii wine ke swaad ko naram karne ke liye protein milaanaa
 Brix is a measure of soluble solids in grape juice and represents not only sugars but also many other soluble substances, such as salts, acids, and tannins, sometimes called fully soluble solids
 haalanki sharkara sabase zyada maatr main upasthit rahane vaala yogic he or isliye saare vyavhaarik uddeshyon se ye ikaiyaan sharkara str kaa ek maapan hai
 The level of sugar in the grapes is important not only because it determines the final alcohol content in the wine, but also because it is an indirect index of the maturity of the grapes
 bricks ) ghol ke gram ke prati 100 gram main mapa jaataa he, isliye 20 Bx kaa matlab he ki 100 gram ras main 20 gram ghulansheel yogic maujuud hai
 Other common measures of sugar content in grapes are also specific gravity, ishle, and boom
 French Bume has the advantage that a Bé ° gives approximately one percent alcohol value
 saath hi ek Be° 1
8 bricks ke baraabar hota he yani prati sau gram main 1
8 gram sharkara
 isse yah nirnay lene main madad milti he ki agar ras main sharkara kam he to ek pratishat alcohol paane ke liye prati 100 mi
lee
 main 1
8 gram milaayaa jaae yaa 18 gram prati litre
 is prakriya ko cheptliseshan kaha jaataa he or yah kai deshon main avaidh he 
 aam taur par dry teble wine banane ke liye 20 se 25 ke bich Bx vaanchhneeya he 
 The BRICS test can be performed either in the laboratory or in the field itself, in order to quickly gain signal points to look for glucose levels
 bricks ko aam taur par refrectometer se mapa jaataa he jabaki duusari vidhiyaan hidrometer kaa prayog karti hai
 Hydrometers are generally a cheaper option
 sharkara ke adhik shuddh maapan ke liye liye yah yaad rakhana zaruri he ki sabhi maapan us taapmaana se prabhavit hote hai jis taapmaana par reeding lee gayi he
 Equipment suppliers typically provide revision charts
 vashpashil amlata pareekshan wine main vaashp dwaara asavith hone vaale amla kii kisi tarah kii upasthiti ko sunishchit karata he
 Acetic acid is predominantly present but lactic, butyric, propionic, and formic acids can also be found
 aam taur par yah pareekshan in amlon kii jaanch ek cash steel main karata he lekin echpisiel, gas chrometography or anzymetic vidhi jaise nae tareeke uplabdh hai
 The amount of volatile acidity found in grapes is negligible because it is a by-product of metabolism of microorganisms
 yah yaad rakhana mahatvapurn he ki acetic acid jeevanu ko viksit hone ke liye oxigen kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In addition to completely removing the air from the wine containers, adding sulfur dioxide controls the growth of bacteria
 kharaab angooron ko nikaal dene se bhi acetic acid jeevanu se sambandhit samasyaon se bachaa ja saktaa he
 The use of sulfur dioxide and the addition of a fraction of Saccharomyces producing low vapor acids can affect the yeast producing acetic acid
 wine se asthir amlata ko hataane ke liye ek apekshaakrit nayaa tarika reverse osmosis he
 Blending can also help - wines with high volatile acidity can be filtered and mixed into wines with low volatile acidity so that acetic acid levels remain below the sensory threshold
 vaanchit swaad praapt karne ke kram main botling se pehle vibhinn baichon ke wine ko mishrit kiya ja saktaa he
 The wine maker can overcome the perceived drawbacks by mixing the wines of different grapes and batches prepared under different conditions
 is tarah ke samaayojan amla yaa tannin ke staron ke samaayojan kii tarah atyant saral or ek susangat swaad praapt karne ke liye vibhinn kismon yaa wintages kii blanding kii tarah atyant jatil bhi ho sakate hai
 Finishing agents are used during wine production to remove tannins, remove irritability, and remove microscopic particles that may spoil the wine
 koun sa fining agent istemaal kiya janaa he yah wine nirmaataa dwaara tay kiya jaataa he or isamen alag-alag utpaada ke anusaar or yahan tak ki alag-alag batch ke anusaar antar ho saktaa he 
 Gelatin has been in use in wine production for centuries and is recognized as a traditional method for the purification or purification of wines
 yah tannin tatv ko kam karne ke liye bhi aam taur par sabase adhik istemaal kiya jane vaala agent he
 Generally no gelatin is left in the wine as it reacts with the elements of the wine, because after purification it forms a precipitate that is filtered and removed before bottling
 gelatin ke alaava wine ke liye anya fining agenton ko aksar jaanwaron yaa machhliyon ke utpaadon se taiyaar kiya jaataa he jaise ki micronised potacium casinet, andon ke safed bhaag, haddiyon kii raakh, bail kaa rakt, isinglass, pivipipi, lisoxime or skim milk powder
 Some aromatic wines contain ingredients extracted from honey or egg yolk
 gaiyr-pashu-aadhaarit filtering agenton ko bhi aksar istemaal kiya jaataa he jaise ki bentonite, dyatmesious arth, selulose pad, kaagaj ke filter or jhillidaar filter 
 The most common preservative used in wine making is sulfur dioxide, which is obtained by mixing sodium or potassium metabisulfate
 ek anya upyogi parirakshak potacium sorbett he
 Sulfur dioxide has two major functions, first it is an anti-microbial agent and second it is an anti-oxidation agent
 white wine taiyaar karne main ise kinvan se pehle or alcoholic kinvan kii prakriya puri hone ke turant baad milaayaa ja saktaa he
 If mixed with alcohol after fermentation, it can prevent or prevent melolactic fermentation, bacterial damage, and help protect against the harmful effects of oxygen
 100 milligram prati litre tak milaayaa ja saktaa he lekin uplabdh yaa swatantra sulfur diaksaide ko bhi aspireshan vidhi se mapa janaa chahie or ise 30 milligram prati litre par samyojit kiya janaa chahie
 uplabdh sulfur diaksaide ko botling ke samay tak is str par banaae rakhaa janaa chahie
 rose vins ke liye ise kam maatra main milaayaa ja saktaa he or uplabdhta str 30 milligram prati litre se adhik nahin hona chahie
 Sulfur dioxide can be used at high levels before the ferment to allow the color to stabilize in preparing red wine, otherwise it is used at the end of the melolactic form and functions in the same way as in white wine
 is
 haalanki laal dhabbon kii bleaching ko rokane ke liye kam maatra main iskaa istemaal kiya janaa chahie or kaayam rahane vaala str takreeban 20 milligram prati litre hona chahie
 iske alaava halke oxikaran ko dur karne or acetic acid jeevanu ke vikaas ko rokane ke liye alcoholic ferment ke baad or malolactic ferment se pehle red wine main isaki choti matraaen milaai ja sakati hai
 Without the use of sulfur dioxide, the bacteria can easily cause bacteria to be destroyed, no matter how clean the wine preparation method
 potacium sorbett, vishesh rup se botalon main band mithi vinon ke liye khamir sahit kavak ke vikaas ko niyantrit karne main prabhavi hota he
 However, one potential danger is from sorbet's metabolism of geraniol of a potent and is a very unpleasant by-product
 isse bachane ke liye yaa to wine ko steroil kar bottleband kiya janaa chahie yaa phir isamen itnaa sulfur dioxide hona chahie ki yah jeevanu ke vikaas ko roak sake
 steroil botling main filtereshan kaa upyog bhi shaamil he
 Filtration is used in wine making to serve two purposes, purification and microorganism stabilization
 In purification, larger particles that affect the direct appearance of the wine are removed
 sookshmjeev sthirikaran main wine kii sthirataa ko prabhavit karne vaale jeevon ko hataaya jaataa he or isliye punah-kinvan yaa nuqasaan kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 The process of purification is concerned with the removal of particles; For rough polishing that are larger than 5–10 micrometers, for purification or polishing that are larger than 1–4 micrometers
 sookshmjeev sthirikaran ke liye kam se kam 0
65 micrometer filtereshan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 However, filtering at this stage can lighten the color and appearance of the wine
 sookshmjeev sthirikaran sterility kaa sanket nahin detaa he
 This simply means that a sufficient amount of yeast and bacteria has been removed
 wine ko surakshit or bottle main avaanchit kinvan ko rokane main madad karne ke liye ant main sulphite kii kuch maatra milaayi jaati he
 Wine bottles are then traditionally sealed with cork, although alternative measures are tried such as synthetic cork and screwcaps for bottling wine, which are less likely to contain cork and are faster
 Are becoming popular with ant main bottle ke sire par ek capsule lagaaya jaataa he or majbootee se silband karne ke liye use garm kiya jaataa he
 Traditionally these are known as vintner k; The person involved in the production of wine is called a winemaker
 inhen aam taur par wineriyon yaa wine companiyon dwaara niyukt kiya jaataa he

 The hairy rhinoceros is an extinct species of rhinoceros that spread to Europe and Asia in the Pleistocene era

 It is estimated that it was alive in Siberia by 8,000 BCE
 inhen pashaan kaal ke maanvon ne dekha tha or pramanswaroop inke pracheen chitra gufaaon main bane hue milte hai
 The scientific name of hairy rhinoceros is 'silodonta antiquitatis'
 iske jeevvaigyanik vansh 'celodonta' kaa matlab 'khokhla daant' hota he
 In Siberia, the appearance of hairy rhinoceros is known from the photographs made by the Adivasis on the walls of cold-frozen carcasses and caves
 sar-se-dum tak yah 10-12 foot lambaa hua karata tha or iskaa vazan 2,700-3,200 kilo hota tha

 bada sharir or ghaney bal hone se yah apane sharir main barfile halaat main bhi garmahat banaae rakh saktaa tha
 Scientists do not know exactly what was the reason for the destruction of hairy rhinoceros
 ek dharna he ki jaise-jaise aadhunik maanav or niandarthal maanav inkaa shikaar karne lage, dhire-dhire yah vilupt ho gaye
 Another belief is that when the pre-ice age started to end, the weather was hot and it could not survive under the conditions of the new environment
 ek teesri dharna yah bhi he ki is jati main ek aisi nai jaanaleva beemaari fail gai jisane puri jati hi tezi se khatm kar daali
