 vishesh paristhitiyon main jab kisi desh kii nyaay vyavastha ko sena apane haath main le leti he, tab jo niyam prabhavi hote hai unhen sainik kanoon yaa marshall lau kaha jaataa he
 Sometimes martial law is imposed in that area during war or after winning an area
 udhaaharan ke liye dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad germany or japan main marshall lau lagu kiya gaya tha
 Apart from this, martial law is often imposed even after the coup
 kabhi-kabhi bahut badi prakritik aapadaa aane par bhi marshall lau laga diya jaataa he lagu karte hai
 ) marshall laa ke antargat karfu aadi vishesh kanoon hote hai
 Often a tribunal of the army is appointed to give justice under martial law called a court martial
 iske antargat bandi pratyakshikaran yachika jaise adhikaar nilambit kiye jate hai
 Military law, on the one hand, implies the confession of the authorities that a situation has arisen in the country or region, especially when it is necessary to face the force with strength, so they should have such unusual rights in their hands which the period of crisis should be used
 In the internal zone of the country, in this situation, instead of the process of the courts, only the orders of the executive or military administrator can be made The recognition is received
 duusari ore faujee kanoon ek kanoonee pratyay kaa vichaar he, jiske dwaara naagarik nyaayalayon ne un asaadhaaran adhikaron ke niyantran kaa praytn kiya he jo karypalika dwaara rajya ke nagarikon par lagu karne ke liye adhigruhit kiye jate hai
 Thus military law is different from military law, which is the special law governing armed forces
 naagarik adhikaar ke prayog ke hetu jab sashastr sena se kaam liya jaataa he tab sena naagarik adhikariyon ke niyantran main hi apana kaary karti he or aparaadhiyon par saadhaaran nyaayalayon main vichaar hota he
 But in military law, the powers of civil officers and courts are suspended and criminals are prosecuted before the army commission
 englad main samrat ko sankatkaal ghoshit karne kaa adhikaar nahin he, kintu yuddh ke samay karypalika ko sansadeey vidhaan ke antargat tathaa tadnurup adhiniyamon ke antargat anek vyavasthaayen tathaa aadesh prasaarit karne ke vyapkadhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Nevertheless, the exercise of those rights takes place under the dual control of the Legislature and the Court
 amareeki vidhi main raashtrapati ko, congressi karrwai se swatantra, faujee kanoon ghoshit karne kaa kahan tak adhikaar he or us sthiti main vidhayika tathaa nyaayalayon dwaara kahan tak niyantran kiya ja saktaa he, yah ab bhi vivaad kaa vishay he tathaa is maamle main kanoonee sthiti ab bhi spasht nahin he
 In India too, in the absence of a clear constitutional directive, it is controversial who is entitled to declare a military law
 faujee kanoon sambandhi ullekh keval 34veen dhara main he, jo kisi vishesh kshetra main faujee kanoon uthaa liye jane ke baad kshatipurti adhinium kii vyavastha karti he
 But similar to military law, the President has the right under Section 359 to suspend judicial execution of the rights under Section 21 and 22
 yah samajha jaataa he ki yah mulat: faujee kanoon kaa hi rup he, kintu prathit hota he ki sarvocch nyaayalay ne ise vivaad ke liye chhod diya he jo ho, is sambandh main koi bhi mat apanaaya jaae, samvidhan kii dhara 352 ke antargat sankatkaal kii ghoshnaa kaa moulik adhikaron par prabhaav newnaadhik maatra main faujee kanoon jaisaa hi he
 Thus, as long as the crisis situation persists under section 358, the executive has the right to violate the provisions of section 19
 raashtrapati dwaara dhara 359 ke antargat sankatkalin avadhi tak yaa aadesh main ullikhit avadhi tak ke liye duusare moulik adhikaar bhi sthagit kiye ja sakate hai
 There is only so much control over the authority of the President that the declaration of crisis must be presented to Parliament for approval
 is ghoshnaa ko sansad ke samaksh prastut karne kii koi nishchit avadhi nahin hoti or na prastut kiye jane par kisi prakaar kaa dand kaa pravidhan hi he, kintu ghoshnaa ke prasaarit hone ke do maas pashchaat vah swat: samaapt ho jaati he
 There is no restriction on the President when one declaration ends and then another is issued
 dhara 359 ke antargat jari kiya gaya raashtrapati kaa aadesh sansad ke samaksh yathashighra prastut hona chahie
 It is left to the executive to decide the time of this presentation because even if the President's order is not presented before the Parliament, its effect is not reduced nor is there any system of legal action in the absence of submission
 san 1962 ke chini akraman ke dauraan, raashtrapati ne samvidhan kii 14, 21 or 22 dharao kaa nishpaadan sthagit karke sankatkalin sthiti kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The public was severely criticized for the excessive delay in announcing the declaration, even after the situation became quite normal
 is tathy ne sankatkalin adhikaron ke sambandh main kuch or sangrakshan lagane kii aavashyaktaa pragat kar di he, kyonki aisa na hone par koi bhi aviveki karyaadhikari apni suvidha ke liye samvidhan kaa unmoolan karke faujee kanoon ko sthaayee kar de saktaa he
 We have not yet forgotten that Weimar Constitution of Germany, according to which various kinds of tips were resorted to in order to not let the legal rule become permanent
 bharat main bhi is prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon ke prati udasin rahanaa uchit na hoga
 The Hakhamani dynasty or the Ajmid Empire was a ruling dynasty of ancient Iran
 yah pracheen iran ke gyaat itihaas kaa pehla shaasha vansh tha jisane aaj ke lagbhag sampoorn iran par apni prabhusatta hasil kii thi or iske alaava apane charamkaal main to yah pashmim main yunaan se lekar purv main sindhu nadi tak or uttar main caspian sagar se lekar dakshin main arab sagar tak fail gaya tha
 After this, such a large empire was able to establish only Sasani rulers

 In the west, this empire is remembered for its authority over Egypt and Babylon, war with Greece and cooperation in the construction of the temple of the Jews

 Kuru has been an extremely majestic king who was the father of the Kauravas in the Mahabharata, in his name Kuru was one of the 16 Mahajanapadas of ancient India

 Its capital was probably Hastinapur or Indraprastha

 The boundaries of this empire were spread from India to Egypt, Libya and Greek
 hakhaamani yani hakhaamansh vansh ke shaasha saatvin sadi se anshaan naamak ek chote se rajya ke shaasha the jo aadhunik dakshin-pashchimi iran ke pars praant main kendrit tha
 At the time when the Hakhamani or Ajmeed rulers took power, the Meedis were the most powerful people in Iran at that time
 anshaan yani pars yani faras ke rajya uske sahyogi the
 These people fought against Assyria
 isapurv san 559 main jab kuru vanshanugat rup se anshaan kaa raja bana to usne meed prabhutv sweekaar karne se manaa kar diya or mid samrajya ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 In 549 BCE, he captured Hamadan, the capital of the med king Astyagas
 usne apane ko paras kaa shah ghoshit kar diya or mid samrajya ko apana sahyogi rajya bana diya
 This changed the relationship of Medea and Persia completely, and Persia became the center of Iranian sovereignty for centuries to come
 kaha jaataa he ki kurosh media ke raja astyagas kaa rishte main naati lagata tha
 The absence of a father-son relationship between kings in the Hakhamani dynasty always leads to differences among historians
 is sattapalat ke baad, iske vipareet jo ki us samay ke baaqi pashchimi iran ke raajaaon ke saath hota tha - kuru ne baaqi chote samrajyon kii adheenta yaa barabari bhi sweekaar nahin kii or samrajya vistaar main jute gaya

 But within few days Dara killed Gaumata and became Shah

 Due to its temporal superiority, Sparta was recognized as the overall leader of the Joint Greek Army Corps during the greek-persian Wars
 Between 431 and 404 BCE, Sparta was the principal enemy of Athens during the Peloponnesian War, from which it emerged as the great conqueror, however, with considerable damage
 In 371 BCE, Sparta suffered defeat at the hands of Thebes in the Battle of Leukatra, which ended the importance of Sparta in Greece
 However, it retained its political independence until 146 BC
 apni saamaajik vyavastha or samvidhan ke kaaran pracheen yunaan main sparta bejod tha, jisane sainya-prashikshan or utkrushtataa par puri tarah apana dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Its inhabitants were Spartiates, Mothakes, Perioikoi, and Heltos
 Spartiates had to undergo rigorous agitated training and educational governance, and the Spartans were thought to be invincible in the organized array of combat wars

 Sparta used to be a subject of attraction in its time, as well as the West started to follow the revival of cultural education
 Sparta continues to fascinate Western culture, praising Sparta as essence

 sparta nagar ke kaaphi kareebi anchal main, tegetos pahaado ke purvi pathaar ko, aamtaur par lekkonia ke rup main ullekh kiya jaataa tha

 Between the eighth and seventh centuries BCE, Sparta experienced civil strife and anarchy, both later validated by Herodotus and Thucydides

 These reforms are evidence of the early history of superior cultural Sparta

 In the later ancient cultural period, Athens, Thebes and Persia as well as Sparta were the dominant powers in fighting against each other to create their supremacy
 As a result of the Peloponnesian War, Sparta, traditionally a continental culture, became a naval power
 Arriving at the peak of its power, Sparta subjugated several major Greek states and even managed to capture the aristocratic Athenian navy
 By the end of the 5th century BC it emerged as a kingdom that overthrew the Athenian Empire and invaded the Persian provinces of Anatolia
 yah ek aisi avadhi thi jisamen sparton aadhipaty ne apni chhap chodi he
 During the Corinthian War, Sparta faced a major coalition of important Greek states, Thebes Athens, Corinth and Argos
 The alliance initially gained Persian support, in Anatolia, whose lands had been invaded by Sparta and feared further expansion of Sparta into Asia

 The incident severely damaged Sparta's naval power but could not end its aspiration to attack Persia further until the Athenian army destroyed the Spartan coastline and the old Spartans had the Halot Rebellion in mind

 After a terrible military defeat at the hands of Thebes Epaminondos in the Battle of Liechtra, Sparta was oriented to a long-term collapse
 It was the first time that the Spartan army was completely defeated in a site battle

 For the purpose of preaching, he sent a famous priest named Augustine to England who started preaching Christianity in the court of King Athalbert of Kent
 ethlbert ne france kii ek isai rajkumaari se shaadi kii thi, at: usne isai dharm sweekaar kar liya or augustin kaa kentrebari main girjaghar banane kii ajna de di
 Thus Pope Gregory's efforts resulted in the promotion of Christianity in England again

 He was the son of Ramaswamy Dixit
 unke dada kaa naam govind dikshitar tha
 He was born in Thiruvarur or Thiruvarur or Tiruvaiyaru
 muttuswaami kaa janm manmatha varsh, tamil panchang anusaar panguni maas, krittika nakshatra main hua tha
 Muttuswamy was named after Selvamuttu Kumaraswamy located in the Vaidyeswaran temple
 aisi manyata he ki muttuswami kaa janm unke mata or pita ke bhagavan vaidyeshwaran kii prarthana karne se hua tha
 Muttuswamy had two younger brothers, Baluswami and Chinnaswamy, and his sister's name was Balambal
 muttuswami ke pita ramswami dikshit ne hi raag hansadhvani kaa udbhav kiya tha
 Muttuswamy started teaching religion, literature, ornamentation and mantra knowledge from his childhood and he had studied music from his father
 muttuswami ke kishoravastha main hi, unke pita ne unhen chidambaranath yogi naamak ek bhikshu ke saath tirthayatra par sangeet or darshanik gyaan praapt karne ke liye bhej diya tha
 During this pilgrimage, he visited many places in North India and got a comprehensive view on religion and music which was reflected in his many compositions
 kaashi main apane pravaas ke dauraan, unke guru chidambarnath yogi ne muttuswami ko ek adwitiya veena pradaan kii or uske sheeghra baad hi unka nidhan ho gaya

 Keeping in mind the tradition of Brahmin education, Muttu Swami learned and studied the Sanskrit language, Vedas and other major religious texts deeply
 unako praarambhik shiksha unke pita se mili thi
 After some time, Muttuswamy went to Benares or Varanasi with the great saint Chidambaranath Yogi to learn music and there was a period of learning and study for 5 years
 guru ne unhen mantropadesh diya va unako hindustani shastreey sangeet kii shiksha di
 Muttuswamy returned to South India after the Guru's death
 jab tab vah chidambarnath yogi ke saath rahe, unhone uttar bharat main kaaphi bhraman kiya va kaaphi kuch seekhney ko mila
 a special veena was also given to him by his Guru during study and reading
 puranic katha ke anusaar, muttuswami ke guru unhen tiruttani kii yatra karne ke liye kaha
 There, while he was sitting in meditation posture, an old man came to him and asked him to open his mouth
 buudhe aadmi unke munh main shakkar kii mithai rakh gaayab ho gaya
 As he opened his mouth, he had visions of the deity Murugan, and only then did Muttuswamy sing his first composition "sri Nathadi guruguho" in the raga Meyamalavagola
 is geet ne bhagwaan ko sanskrit main pehali vibhakti main sambodhit kiya, baad main dikshit ne bhagwaan ke sabhi aath avtaron par kritiyon kii rachana kii
 These were mostly in the sub-sections praising Murugan in sect / indulgent form
 phir muttuswami tirthaton ke nikal gayi or kanchi, tiruvannamalai, chidambaram, tirupati or kalahasti, shrirangam ke mandiron kii yatra or vahaan kritiyon kii rachana kii or tiruvarur laut aaye
 Muthuswamy Dixit had proficiency on Veena, and Veena's performance can be clearly seen in his compositions, especially in Gaman
 unki kriti balgopal main, unhone khud ko veena gayak ke rup main parichay diya
 He also majored on violin and among his disciples, along with Thanjavilu of Thanjavur quartet and his brother Baluswamy Dixit, took the lead in using violin in Carnatic music, which is now an integral part of most Carnatic artists
 tiruvarur lautne par, unhone tiruvarur mandir parisar main har devtaa ke upar kriti kii rachana kii, jisamen tyagaraj, peethasin devtaa, nilotlambal, unki patni or devi kamalambal aadi shaamil the
 This happened when he composed the famous Kamalamba Navvarna Kriti, which was filled with exemplary literature on the deity Srichakra
 ye navavarnan sanskrit bhashaa ke sabhi aath avadharanaon main the or prayek varsh guruguh jayanti par gaaya jaataa he
 He continued to demonstrate his skills by creating a Navagraha work in praise of the nine planets
 sahitya ke geet, mantra or jyotish shastron ke gahare gyaan ko darshaate he
 Neelotlambal Kriti is another outstanding collection of his compositions that revived the dying ragas like Narayangaul, Purvagaul and Chaagaul
 thanjore ke chaar nritak guru bhaaiyon chinnaya, ponneya, vadivalu or shivanandam ne muthuswami dikshit se sampark kiya, or unase sangeet seekhney kii ichha vyakt kii or unase thanjore main unke saath aane ke liye aagrah kiya
 There, Dixit imparted to him the teachings of the 72 Mela tradition distributed by Venkata Vaidyanath Dixit
 chaatro ne apane guru ko mahima karte hue navratna maala naamak nau geeton kii ek sangrah banaakar unhain samarpit kiya
 These four disciples are also known as Thanjavur quartet and are honored as the lead composer for Bharatanatyam
 unke shishyon main, ponanya or chinanya ne tiruvanantpuram ke shri swati thirunal ke raaj-darbar kalakaaron ke rup main bhi kaam kiya
 At a young age, Dixit was exposed to the music of Western bands at Fort St
 George
 baad ke charan main, dikshit ne kuch chalis geeton ko kai dhunon main banaaya, jaise ki sankarbharana
 This work is now known as Nottuswara literature
 in rachanaaon main celtic or barok shaileyon kaa prabhaav kaaphi spasht he 
 There is a misconception that these were written on the orders of CP Brown, the collector of Cuddappa
 yah sambhav nahin he kyonki donon kabhi nahin mili
 Muttuswamy Dixit left Madras by 1799
 brown, 1817 main madras aaye, 1820 main unhone telegu sikhi or usee varsh kuddappa main chale gaye
 In 1835, Muttuswamy prayed like every day on the wonderful, divine and holy Vela of Deepawali
 tatpashchaat unhone apane vidhyaarthiyon ko "minakshi me mudam dehi" geet gane ke liye kaha
 The song was composed in the Eastern Kalyani Raga
 ve aage bhi kai geet gaate rahe, jaise hi unhone "min lochani pash mochani" gaanaa shuru kiya tabhi muttuswami ne apane haathon ko uthaate hue "shive paahi" kahkar divangat ho gaye
 His samadhi is in Ettaiyapuram
 yah sthal kovilapattee or tuticorin ke paas sthit he
 Muttuswamy visited many pilgrimages and temples and saw deities
 unhone bhagwaan murugan yaa muruga yaa kartikeya, jo tiruttani ke aradhya dev hai ke darshan kiye or unki prashansa main kai geet rach daale
 It was in Tiruttani that he composed his first work, "sri Nathadi Guruguho Jayati"
 yah geet mayamalavgulam raag va aadi taal main rachaa gaya tha
 He then made pilgrimage to many famous temples
 mana jaataa he ki dikshitar ne lagbhag 3000 se bhi adhik geeton kii rachana kii, joki dev-prashansa par yaa kisi nek bhaavana par aadhaarit thim
 Many of these compositions have now been destroyed
 unke dwaara rachit kritiyon main navagraha kriti, kamalamba navavaranam kriti, abhayamba navavaranam kriti, shiv navavaranam kriti, panchaling sthal kriti, maniparval kriti aadi sammalit hai
 Muttuswamy has given special mention to Bhava, Raga and Taal etc
 in all his compositions
 muttuswami dikshitar ko unke upnaam "guruguh" ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 All his compositions have been composed in the fourth phase
 unki kriti "balgopal" main ve vainik gayak naam se prasiddh hue
 His 450 to 500 compositions are still very popular today, most of which are sung by classical composers in classical music festivals
 unki rachanaaen adhikanshat: sanskrit ke kriti rup main hai, arthath, sangitamay kavita ke rup main he
 Muttuswamy traveled to many holy pilgrimages throughout his life and composed creations on deities and temples
 dikshit ko devataaon ke liye sabase vistrut shrinkhalaa kaa rachiyata mana jaataa he
 Each of his works is presented in a unique and talented manner
 rachanaaen gaharaai or maadhurya kii aatma ke liye jane jate hai- kuch raagon ke lekar unki pariklpana abhi bhi unki sanrachanaon par maanya hai
 His Sanskrit songs praise the temple deity, but removing the implicit relationship between Advaita philosophy and polytheistic worship, Muthuswamy has given the origin of Advaita thought in his songs
 unke geeton main mandir ke itihaas or uski prishthbhumi ke bare main bahut jaankaree di gai he, jiske kaaran hi aaj in puraane tirthon main kai paramparaon ko banaae rakhaa gaya he
 Another important feature in his compositions is the verses versed in the lines of the songs
 muttuswami ne sabhi 72 melkarta raagon kii rachana karne kii pariyojna ko apanaaya, jisase kai durlabh or lupt raagon ke liye sangeet kaa udhaaharan mil sakaa
 In addition, he was a pioneer of Samastri Charanam work
 dikshit, taal ke visheshgy the or karnataka sangeet ke sabhi saat buniyadi taalon main kriti ke ekmaatr nirmaankarta the
 Dixit has shown his skill in Sanskrit by composing in all eight sections
 raag bhav kii samruddhi ke liye, unke darshanik antarvastu kii mahanata or sahitya kii bhavyata ke liye, dikshit ke geet aprapya he
 Muthuswamy Dixit has created several works in groups
 jiname "vatapi ganpati" ko unki sabase prasiddh or sarvottam kriti mana jaataa he
 Muttuswamy Dixit composed a song on Kantimati Amman, the goddess of the Nellappar temple
 yah geet durlabh raag kaa ek durlabh geet mana jaataa he
 It is also said that he along with Rama Ashtapati built the Upanishad Brahmanamandal at Kanchipuram
 durbhaagya se, yah kriti ab kho chuki he

 Geotropism can occur due to well-known natural earthquakes, man-made explosions in underground nuclear tests and petroleum exploration etc
 and strong winds, sea waves, strong monsoons and micro-waves caused by hurricanes or depression in the sea area
 uchit reeti se anusthapit, kshaitij bukampamapi bhugati ke purv pashchim yaa uttar dakshin ke ghatak ko abhilikhit karata he or urdhwadhar bukampamapi urdhwadhar gati, arthath bhugati ke urdhwadhar ghatak ko abhilikhit karata he
 Around the middle of the 19th century, the foundation of mechanical seismology was laid, seismometers were built, and nets of observatories were laid for earthquake recording
 in dinon robert mallett dwaara kiya gaya kaary mahatvapurn tha
 In 1892, John Milan developed a surface seismometer in collaboration with Knott, Youig, and Gray in Japan, and since then seismometers have been used to collect real mechanical data from many parts of the world
 bharat kii kuch pradhan vendhashalaon main miln bukampamapiyon kaa upyog 1898 i0 main prarambh hua
 In 1905, the Omori Uyig earthquakemeter arrived at the observatories of Shimla, Bombay and Calcutta
 iske baad anyaanya bukampamapiyon kaa upyog anek vedhashalaon main prarambh hua
 a mechanical seismometer consists of a horizontal or vertical pendulum, mounted on an inclined shell, or located deep enough in the earth, to be available
 kaanpati prithvi ke kaaran lolak main utpann companon ko upyukt yukti se pravardhit or abhilikhit kiya jaataa he
 The pendulum is often revolutionized to filter out unwanted oscillations
 jaisaa upar spasht kiya ja chukaa he, kuch bukampalekhiyon ko bukampamapi ke rup main or kuch ko twaranmaapi ke rup main abhikalpit kiya jaataa he
 Milan Shaw and Wood Andersen are major instruments in mechanical seismographs and are used in many observatories in India and abroad
 lolak kaa arvatkaal 10 se 12 second tak tathaa avamandan anupaat 20 :1 hota he
 Magnification is mechanical with optics and static magnification varies from 150 to 250
 lagbhag 0

 As a damping device, a copper plaque is attached to the pendulum, moving between the poles of the four hypores

 The static amplitude of the device usually ranges from 1,500 to 2,000
 vidyucchubankeey bukampalekhi, yaa bukamp maapi main jadtviya dravyaman chubank ke dhruvon ke madhya gatishalee rahata he
 a coil of conductor wire is wrapped around the code, allowing it to act as an electrification
 kundali main prerit vidyuddhara jadtviya dravyaman or chumbak ke bich kii saapeksh gati, arthath prithvi ke kampan, par nirbhar karti he
 The electricity generated in this manner is recorded by the appropriate photometer
 bannieoff upkaran is prakaar ke bukampamapi kaa acha udhaaharan he
 The device is both horizontal and vertical
 ye sabhi upkaran bukamp yaa sookshmbukamp ko abhilikhit karne ke liye abhikalpit hote hai
 Apart from these, there are many types of seismometers, which are small, portable and usually designed with appropriate damping etc
 according to the electromagnetic theory and nowadays are used in recording seismic waves generated by humanized explosions in seismic prospecting of oil etc
 bukampamapiyon kaa abhikalpan vibhinn prakaar kii bukamp tarangon, pra, praathmik, gau, gaun tathaa prishth tarang aadi kaa abhilekhan karne ke liye hota he, jo bukamp ke strot se is prakaar prasarjit hoti he ki koi bhi unki vibhinn pravasthaon ke antar ko abhilekh se jaan saktaa he
 This is very important from the point of view of studying the distance and depth of focus of the epicenter of the earthquake
 kisi bhi prakshan sthal par pra or gau tarangon ke abhilikhit antaraal se pra or gau tarango kaa veg gyaat kar liya jaataa he, jisase bukamp ke arrikendre kii duuri sidhe sidhe gyaat ho jaati he
 Similarly, the study of the records of local earthquakes provides useful information about the earth's crust and the earth's interconnection with distant earthquakes
 ullekhneey he ki bukampamapiyon ke abhilekhon ke aadhaar par jo un dinon paryaapt sookshmagrahi na the, oldam ne sujhaayaa ki prithvi kaa crode thos nahin, sambhavat: taral he
 Today, when seismology has developed into earthquake engineering and earthquake survey, the importance of seismometers cannot be overstated except for the study of earthquakes and micro-earthquakes

 Courtesy of Sukhsagar itvaa main bharat ke bihar rajya ke antargat magadh mandal ke aurangabad jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Cinic is a Greek philosophy sect, famous for its neglect of society and prohibitive view of individual life
 is sampradaay kaa sansthaapak antistheneez tha
 At first he was a sophist
 baad main sucraat ke swatantra vichaaron, parahitchintan tathaa aatmatyag se prabhavit hokar, vah use apana guru maanane laga
 When the Greek democracy condemned Socrates to death, Antisthenes was unwilling to reconsider the justification of the sovereignty of society over the individual to punish a self-styled man like Socrates
 apane uddeshy kii purti ke liye, usne "prakruti kii ore chalo" kaa naaraa lagaaya
 Pointed to the natural life in which every human being was a master of himself
 koi kisi kaa das na tha
 To adopt that life, there was a need to be detached from wealth, honor, etc
 antistheneez ne ise saharsha sweekaar kiya
 But, in supporting this type of life, he did not want to let the meaning of education, rituals, accretion etc
 disappear
 isliye, usase maanviya jivan kii abhivruddhi kii naitik vyakhya kii
 He was influenced by Socrates
 sucraat ne gyaan or naitik aacharan main kaaran-kaary-sambandh sthapit kiya tha
 Reiterating these Socratic ideals, Antisthenes tried to show that the re-enactment of auspiciousness is an expression of wisdom, not blindly following blind lines
 budhimaan vyakti samaaj ke adhikansh vyaktiyon dwaara sweekrut ayukt moolyankan ko samay-samay par thik karata rahata he
 a variety of Antisthenes had also prepared a theoretical bench to support their views
 aflatoon ne "saamaanya' kii nirpeksh satta kaa samarthan kiya tha or vyakti ke satya ko "saamaanya' kaa bhaag bataaya tha
 Antisthenes opposed this philosophy of Aflatun
 usne yah dikhaaya ki "saamaanya' kii koi swatantra satta nahin
 An element is considered "normal" due to its prevalence among many individuals
 vyaktiyon se pruthak uskaa koi astitv nahin
 Thus, against the generalism of Aflatun, Antisthenes established "nomadism"
 yahan tak usne "gunkathak par nirbhar paribhaasha' kaa khandan kiya
 He often considered the object to be a specific object or person
 vyakti nirnay vaakyon ke uddeshy banate hai
 Definition is also a type of decision sentence
 kintu, saamaanya gun kisi vishisht vastu kaa vighan nahin ho saktaa
 On this theoretical pedestal, Antisthenes started the individualist philosophy according to which a wise man can be a critic, not a member of society
 antistheneez ke vichaaron ko aage badhaane kaa shrey uske shiro dioginis ko diya jaataa he
 He used to say, "I am a dog barking at the evils of society; my job is to set the proper values in the prevailing values" With these, the Sinic sect did not end
 unki parampara unani darshan ke ant tak chalati rahi
 Sinic was not anti-social
 unke vichaar se samaaj ko uchit maarg par chalaane ke liye kuch sachet tathaa nishpaksh samikshakon kii aavashyaktaa thi, jo sweekrut mulyon main samay-samay par sanshodhan karte rahen
 But, for such critics, he understood the need for detachment and isolation from society, along with intellectual development and moral conduct
 apana kaary uchit rup se kar sakane ke liye, sinic darshanikon ne vishesh prakaar kaa rahan-sahan apanaaya tha
 They did not understand the need for good homes, tasty food and pleasant clothes
 kaha jaataa he, dioginis ne kisi puraani naand main apana jivan vyateet kiya
 That was his house
 sucraat ke liye kaha jaataa he ki usne kabhi juute nahin pahane; sardi, garmi ke anusaar apane vastron main parivartan nahin kiya
 But he used to roam in the city of Athens, criticizing the wrongdoers
 is kaam main vyast rahane se vah kabhi apane paitrik vyavsaay main ruchi na le sakaa
 The Cynics received education from the life of Sukuret
 ve samajhate the ki apni samasyaon kaa niraakaran karke hi samaaj kii chaukasee kii ja sakati he
 The Cynics aimed to interest society; However, the way he used to express his viewpoint, he seemed grossly individualistic and cynical of the society
 sinic aadarshon kaa sampradaay ke rup main samuchit nirvaah adhik samay tak sambhav na tha
 According to the last Cynic circumstances, Cynic began to accept the ideals in living
 uttaradhikariyon ke liye praarambhik upadeshtaon kii bhanti virakt evam aatmatyagi hona sambhav na tha
 Therefore, over time, the general meaning of Cynic became a person who neglected society
 kintu maanviya chintan se sinic tatv kaa sarvatha abhaav na ho sakaa
 From time to time, there have been the benefactors of such a society, who have been angry with the misconceptions of the society, have expressed a sense of alienation and have made commentaries that indicate the proper path
 swargeey barnard sha ko beesvin sadi kaa bahut bada sinic kaha ja saktaa he
 The social criticism pervaded in his literature often reaches the surface of neglect, but we cannot reach the meaning of "cynic" without seeking the social interest inherent in that neglect

 bahut samay pehle kii baat he, ek sahuukaar ke saat bete or unki ek bahan karvaa thi
 All the seven brothers loved their sister very much
 yahan tak ki ve pehle use khaanaa khilaate or baad main swayan khate the
 Once his sister was visiting her in-laws from her in-laws
 shaam ko bhai jab apana vyapaar-vyavsaay band kar ghar aae to dekha unki bahan bahut vyakul thi
 All the brothers sat down to eat and urged their sister to eat them, but the sister told that today she has a waterless fast of Karva Chauth and that she can eat only by looking at the moon and offering it to her
 chunki chandramaa abhi tak nahin niklaa he, isliye vah bhukh-pyaas se vyakul ho uthi he
 The youngest brother does not see the condition of his sister and he burns a lamp on a peepal tree and puts it in a sieve
 dur se dekhne par vah aisa prathit hota he ki jaise chaturthi kaa chaand udit ho rahaa ho
 After this, the brother tells his sister that the moon has come out, you can have food after offering it to him
 bahan khushi ke maare sidhiyon par chadhakar chaand ko dekhati he, use arghya dekar khaanaa khaane baith jaati he
 When she puts the first piece in the mouth, she sneezes
 doosraa tukdaa daalati he to usamen bal nikal aata he or jaise hi teesraa tukdaa munh main daalane kii koshish karti he to uske pati kii mrityu kaa samachar use miltaa he
 She gets scared
 uski bhabhi use sachai se avgat karaati he ki uske saath aisa kyon hua
 Due to wrong break of fast of Karva Chauth, the gods are angry with him and they have done so
 sachai jaanane ke baad karvaa nishchay karti he ki vah apane pati kaa antim sanskaar nahin hone degi or apane satitv se unhen punerjeevan dilaakar rahegi
 She sits near her husband's body for a whole year
 uski dekhbhaal karti he
 She collects the dull grass that grows on her
 ek saal baad phir karvaa chouth kaa din aata he
 All her sisters keep fast of Karva Chauth
 jab bhabhiyaan usase aashirwad lene aati hai to vah prayek bhabhi se 'yama sooyee le lo, piy sooyee de do, mujhe bhi apni jaisi suhaagin bana do' aisa aagrah karti he, lekin har baar bhabhi use agali bhabhi se aagrah karne kaa kah chali jaati he
 In this way, when the sister-in-law of the sixth number comes, Karva repeats the same thing to her
 yah bhabhi use bataati he ki chunki sabase chote bhai kii vajah se uskaa vrath tutaa tha atah uski patni main hi shakti he ki vah tumhaare pati ko dobaaraa jivit kar sakati he, isliye jab vah aae to tum use pakad lenaa or jab tak vah tumhaare pati ko jinda na kar de, use nahin chhodana
 Having said that she leaves
 sabase ant main choti bhabhi aati he
 Karva urges them to become Suhagin too, but she starts to avoid
 ise dekh karvaa unhen jor se pakad leti he or apane suhaag ko jinda karne ke liye kahati he
 Sister-in-law notices her to get rid of her, smokes, but does not stop getting her done
 ant main uski tapasya ko dekh bhabhi pasij jaati he or apni choti angulii ko chirakar usamen se amrit uske pati ke munh main daal detii he
 Karva's husband immediately wakes up saying Shree ganesh-shriganesh
 is prakaar prabhu krupa se uski choti bhabhi ke madhyam se karvaa ko apana suhaag waapas mil jaataa he
 o Shri Ganesh Maa Gauri, the way Karva has received the gift of Suhagan to you, so all the Suhaginas should get it
 is katha kaa saar yah he ki shakprasthapur vedadharma brahman kii vivaahita putree veeravati ne karvaa chouth kaa vrath kiya tha
 According to the rules, she had to eat after moonrise, but she did not get hungry and got upset
 uske bhaaiyon se apni bahan kii vyakulata dekhi nahin gai or unhone pipal kii aad main aatishbaajee kaa sundar prakaash failaakar chandroday dikhaa diya or veeravati ko bhojan kara diya
 The result was that her husband immediately disappeared
 adheer veeravati ne baarah maheene tak prayek chaturthi ko vrath rakhaa or karvaa chouth ke din uski tapasya se uskaa pati punah praapt ho gaya
 Once upon a time, a proud woman named Karva lived with her husband in a village by the river
 ek din uskaa pati nadi main snaan karne gaya
 While bathing, a manger held her leg there
 vah manushya karvaa-karvaa kah ke apni patni ko pukaarane laga
 Hearing his voice, his wife Karwa ran away and came and tied the manger with raw thread
 magar ko baandhakar yamraj ke yahan pahaunchi or yamraj se kehane lagi- he bhagwan! magar ne mere pati kaa pair pakad liya he
 In the guilt of taking that leg, you take it to hell with your force
 yamraj bole- abhi magar kii aayu shesh he, atah main use nahin maar saktaa
 Asked to get it done, if you do not do this, i will curse you and destroy you
 sunakar yamraj dar gaye or us pativrata karvaa ke saath aakar magar ko yamapuri bhej diya or karvaa ke pati ko dderghaayu di
 Hey mother! Protect your husbands as you protected your husband
 ek baar pandu putr arjuna tapasya karne nilgiri naamak parvat par gaye

 pujan kar chandramaa ko arghya dekar phir bhojan grahan kiya jaataa he
 Karve of gold, silver or clay are exchanged among themselves, which enhances mutual love
 pujan karne ke baad mahilaayein apane saas-sasur evam bado ko pranaam kar unka aashirwad leti hai
 Then Shankarji told Mata Parvati the fast of Karva Chauth
 is vrath ko karne se striyaan apane suhaag kii raksha har aane vaale sankat se vaise hi kar sakati hai jaise ek brahman ne kii thi
 There was a Brahmin in ancient times
 uske chaar ladke evam ek gunavati ladki thi
 Once the girl was in her maternal home, then Karva Chauth had a fast
 usne vrath ko vidhipurvak kiya
 She remained waterless throughout the day
 kuch khaaya-piyaa nahin, par uske chaaron bhai pareshaan the ki bahan ko pyaas lagi hogi, bhukh lagi hogi, par bahan chandroday ke baad hi jal grahan karegi
 The brothers could not keep up, they showed the sister a false moonlight as soon as evening
 ek bhai pipal kii ped par chalni lekar chadh gaya or deepak jalaakar chalni se roshni utpann kar di
 Then the other brother gave a voice to the sister from below- Look sister, the moon has come out, worship and take food
 bahan ne bhojan grahan kiya
 Her husband died after consuming food
 ab vah duhkhi ho vilaap karne lagi, tabhi vahaan se rani indrani nikal rahi thim
 His grief was not seen from them
 brahman kanya ne unke pair pakad liye or apane dukh kaa kaaran poocha, tab indrani ne bataaya- tuune bina chandra darshan kiye karvaa chouth kaa vrath tod diya isliye yah ksht mila
 Now, if you fast for the whole year for the fourth time, your husband will be alive
 usne indrani ke kahe anusaar chouth vrath kiya to punah saubhagyawati ho gai
 Therefore every woman should do this fast for the longevity of her husband
 draupadi ne yah vrath kiya or arjuna sakushal manovanchit fal praapt kar waapas laut aae
 Since then, Hindu women observe the Karva Chauth fast for their unbroken harmony
