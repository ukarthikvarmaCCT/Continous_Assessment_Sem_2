 Which is surrounded by some priests and hooligans

 usee kshan ek behad khubasurat yuvati ke rup main ek dian pahunchati he or gupha main daakhil hoti he
 She then removes a battered locket from her neck and kills the man, turning into a frightened face

 One night, his younger daughter comes to him and tells that the villagers have found a corpse there
 vahaan pahunchne par gaanv ke logon se ghire us anjaan vyakti kii laash dekhne milti he
 On being asked, it was told that this could often be the work of a mysterious woman wandering in the forest
 jise log dian kehete hai
 But Sameer Thakur calls such witches and devils a blank superstition
 par unamem se ek vyakti ke mutabik kuch varsh pehle jab vah najdiki shahar se gaanv laut rahaa tha, vah apane raste se bhatak gaya tha or chalate-chalate vah jangal main ghuste saath vahaan ek yuvati ko vichrate dekh letaa he
 Who turns into a bat and attacks her face

 His younger brother Sameer Pratap is determined to hunt the witch
 idhar unki patni priti apni beti or bhatiji kaa vaasta dekar jane se rokatii he
 But he had just descended a few steps and Mahendra Pratap says that he has full faith in his brother and gave full support to those who asked for justice from his ancestors
 ve apane bhai ko bataur tohfa "" shabd dete hai or uske subhagya kii kaamana dete hai
 As Sameer leaves his car and passes through the forest, he finds a very beautiful young woman as mentioned by that hick
 vah yuvati samir se car par lift maangati he
 Those people reach an old mansion, behind which is a lake surrounded by forests
 vah samir ko apni maadak adaaon se phaansati he or vah yuvati saath bathtub main nahaane ko rijhaati he
 In this way, his fun-loving drama reaches a physical relationship with him, he pulls that battered locket from his neck
 iske saath hi us ladki kaa ghinauna rup saamne aata ho jo khud ko dian nakita bataati he
 Sameer knows his weakness and so he gets helpless through that "4"
 samir pratap singh us dian ko gaanv kii sarhad tak laate he or thakur ke aadesh par sthaneey log use phaansi par lataka dete hai
 At the same time, a tantric Baba, along with his servants, somehow steals the corpse late at night and brings it back to the temple, where he keeps it in a stone carved coffin and vows that he will get him a new body
 vah sharir aakhir main thakur mahendra pratap kii beti hi shikaar hoti he
 Some days pass their happy and quiet time, both brothers spending hours in their happiness and Sameer's wife Preeti also lovingly looks after her young daughters, her brother-in-law's daughter Yasmin and real daughter Sahila
 aakhir main, ek roj munh-subah ke vakt, chote thakur sahab ko apni bhatiji, yasmine ko unhen musuri ke barding skool bhejne jate hai
 But when those people pass through the deserted wilderness, the engine of the car heats up and stops
 apane ankal kii baat maanate hue choti yasmine car par thahar intjaar karti he or vah radiator ke liye pani lene chal padate hai
 But then, he tantric baba comes out of the thicket of the bushes, hypnotizes the child, and makes a doll with a piece of frac and braided hair
 phir us gudiya ko kaanch kii bottle ko us dian kii kabr tak pahunchaata he
 At the same time, Yasmin in the car also goes towards that temple under the influence of hypnosis
 is darmyaan, samir pratap pani bhare cancetar saath lautate he or car main bacchee nadaarad paakar achambhit hota he
 He follows the trail and later reaches an astonishing area covered with thick bushes
 vahiin duusari taraf, yasmine us shaitanon kii maand main daakhil hoti he or us dian ke tabut nikat pahunchati he
 At an astonishing moment, the witch wakes up and pulls Yasmin inside
 maukey par pahunche samir pratap bacchee ko bachaane kii koshish karte he magar tabut ko kholane main unako deree pad jaati he
 At the same time, the witch's evil spirit now permeates Yasmin's body
 itane main hi, samir pratap apni bhatiji ko bachaane kii naakamayaabi par asahaay hote he jab us tantric ke aadmi use gher lete
 He is taken hostage and killed
 tantric vaapis yasmine ko lekar uske pita thakur mahendra pratap ke haveli le chalate he
 The tantric tells Mahendra Pratap's family in his concocted news that his brother strayed into a river in a terrible storm in the jungle and killed himself
 yasmine ko unke kamare pahunchaakar use sone diya jaataa he, bade thakur sahab apane 2–3 naukaro ko unke jimme saunpta he or sidhiyon ke neeche ruke us tantric baba se miltaa he
 Baba now asks for permission from Thakur to return, but Thakur Sahib requests him to stay and makes Yasmin his servant in return for saving his life
 haalaanki, samir pratap kii patni,, ko yasmine kaa vyavhaar aswabhaavik lagata he
 Being her aunt about the change in behavior of the girl, she tells her brother-in-law about the unique change in her daughter and convinces Yasmin to treat a flabbergast or doctor for treatment
 haalaanki, vah dian, jo bacchee main dhar kar chuki thi, in baton ko sun leti he or der raat ko apni chachee priti ko yasmine ke kamare kii chhatwale pankhe par lataka kar maar detii he
 Mahendra Pratap Thakur, shocked by this incident, decides to send his orphaned younger niece, Sahila, to his maternal grandmother home in Mumbai so that he can stay safe there and stay away from this ill-fated situation
 12 saalon baad, bade thakur ko unki bhatiji kii taraf se uskaa khat miltaa he
 She is very happy to know that she has passed the topper category in her intermediate examination
 vahiin guzarate samay ke saath, badi hoti yasmine bhi ek behad khubasurat yuvati main badal jaati he jo zyaadaatar apane band kamare main rahati or kabhi-kabhaar to jangalon main bhatakati rahati
 He had become very moody and lost in his own world, due to which his father would remain worried all the time
 thakur saab apni bhatiji ke imtahaan main safal hone kii baat baba ko bataate hai or unka bada man he ki vah apni garmiyon kii chhuttiyaan chandan nagar main gujaarne ko bulawaae
 Baba on the other hand sends his demon-like trusted servant Zimbaru to lead his niece, Sahila, so that he does not reach his ancestral residence
 or tab zimbaaru, sahila kii car par dhaava bolta he or uske peeche pad jaataa he
 His second cousin, Satish, pleads for help
 vahiin par tab hero kii tarah hemanth naam kaa balavaan yuvak kaa pravesh hota he, or is musiibat main fasi ladki ko bachaane pahunch jaataa he
 He drives away that Zimbaru and his goons and saves Sahila
 udhar vaapis gaanv par, yasmine city petrol ke ek noujvaan maikenic se milti he jo ek kushal car mistre he or car kii marammat badi dakshata se karata he
 She is very impressed by him and invites him to have a late night picnic on the lake side of the old mansion
 jab vah shaks vahaan pahunchataa he, vah uski khidamat karti he or donon saath main jam pite hai or khaanaa khate hai
 With this increased hangover, the man is now restless to get Yasmin and the same heartbreak that they both are that night
 pramann patr miltaa he
 ) Shortly after midnight, the person's consciousness returns and wakes up
 vah yasmine kii rangahin ho chuki ankhen dekh sihar uthta he or paata he ki uski palake bhi jhapak nahin rahi
 He tries to escape but he again falls on the bed
 tab ladki main basii dian ke niyantran main, apane chaandi kii kataar lekar us aadmi ko jibah kar maar daalati he
 Yasmin Mouth returns home in a hasty darkness
 us shaks kii laash police ko agali subah baraamad hoti he or par uski shinaakht nahin ho paati, or isaki tahakiqaat bhi roak di jaati he
 Meanwhile, Hemant and Sahila come close in this journey and both reach the mansion simultaneously
 thakur mahendra pratap ko sahila ke ghar aane par behad khushi mahasoos hoti he or jab unako maaloom hota he uski musiibat main hemanth use bachaane pahunchaa tha, aakarshak or bahadur yuvak kii is prashansa se wo bhi prabhavit hue bina rah nahin pate or use apane lakdi ke kaarkaane par ek mahatvapurn pad par kaam dilaate hai
 He makes Hemant a part of the same family members as his son
 baavjood, rahasyamay hatyaon kaa silsilaa jari rahata he
 One such evening, Yasmin asks a drunken person to lift the car, and then, at some distance, the witch's soul tears her person's neck to death
 ek raat, sahila apni didi yasmine se unke puraane kamare main saath sone kii ichha jataati he or jald hi use maaloom padataa he ki vahaan kuch ajeeb ho rahaa he, vah apni didi se bhaybheet hoti he or apane ankal mahendra pratap or hemanth se iskaa zikr karti he
 Thakur Mahendra Pratap decides to meet his friend Yasmin for a mental evaluation of his friend, who is himself a psychologist
 doctor apni sammohan vidya se, yasmine ke ateet main ghatit ghatnaon kaa byoraa lete hai or wo tab vah bilkul alag hi shakhsiyat main badal jaati he
 Her dialect changes and says threateningly that she will take revenge by killing every member of the Thakur family
 thakur mahendra pratap shuruyaat main doctor kii baton par yakeen nahin karte, lekin doctor dwaara record kiye gaye recorder tepe sunne par unako vishwaas ho jaataa he, ki unki beti par us dushtatma kaa saaya pad chukaa he
 Despite, Thakur's old relationship with the family and deep friendship, the doctor promises him that he will definitely stay and treat his baby girl
 vahiin doctor pehle to sahila ke dost hemanth se yasmine ke kareeb aane kii naatak rachane ko kehete he taaki sachai par roshni daali ja sake magar yah prayaas bhi vyarth chalaa jaataa he
 However, one night, he sees strange shadows and smoke coming out of Yasmin's room, the doctor walks towards him and he gets to see the wretched appearance of that witch
 vah thakur sahab se is bare main aagaah karte he magar wo hi unki baton par bharose se inkaar karte hai
 The doctor then runs away from his house to save his life, but Raghu, the butler of the house, also makes fun of him while he was leaving the mansion
 is hadabdaahat main, doctor raghu ko bhi pare hataate hue haveli se nikal jaataa he jahaan balakani par maujuud yasmine ke chehre par bahut ajeeb dhang se vijayi muskaan chamakati he
 While the doctor drives his car dangerously on the way to the village, in a hurry, he collides with a tree and finds himself alone in that forest
 vah dian, jo vahaan leti uske pahunchne ke intjaar kar rahi thi, achaanak hi kaale saae kii tarah prakat hoti he or doctor bhi hosh main aane use dekhakar bhay se ankhen fat padati he, phir uske sharir ko bedate hue badi crurata se maar daalati he
 On the other hand, that servant Raghu is also the next victim
 jab vah dian se khaufjada hokar haveli jane ke bajaay kaarkaane main raat bitaane kaa man banaata he or usee raat uski maut hoti he
 Then Hemant and Sahila and his cousin Satish think of ending this trouble, in which Baba's issues were also raised
 hemanth tab us baba kaa peechha karne kaa nishchay karata he jahaan sahila ke saath chhipakar nikalataa he
 In this way, they reach the wilderness
 magar jald hi vah log pakade jate he or sahila ko apane pita samir pratap ko jinda dekh khushi hoti he
 Satish arrives in time, who even saves his life by chasing him to the end
 or tab, samir sidhe apane ghar bhai saab se milane bacchon sang chal padate hai
 Thakur Mahendra is thrilled to find a safe guard for his dear brother
 tab sahila or hemanth us baba se jude sajishon kaa bayaan dete he or samir apane bhai ko suchit karte hai ki baba ne sirf yasmine ke sharir main us dusht daaran kii aatma ko panaah dene kii madad kii he or ab vahi raaton kii khatarnaak musiibat ban chuki he
 At this interval, Baba plans to kill Yasmin on the new moon night so that the witch can be resurrected and immortalized
 vah yasmine ko haveli se uthaakar shaitani maand le chalata he or uski bali chadhaane ke liye havan-yajna kaa intjaam karata he
 But soon his family reaches that moment
 phir yasmine ke sharir se dian ko chhudaane ke liye ve us bottle main band abhimantrit woodu gudiya nasht kar daalate he
 But, due to this misfortune, the elder Thakur loses his daughter's happiness and the fight of life for a long time
 parivaar lagbhag kshanik shok main dub hi jaataa he or tabhi na jane, vah dian behad kapatpurn dhang se apane sharir samet jaag uthati he, magar pavitra '' ke chinh se ve use dubaara kabr main band bhi kara daalate hai
 Then the Thakur family and all the villagers take the coffin to Lord Shiva's temple
 tabut ko mandir bheetar praangan main laayaa jaataa he or samir pratap use hemanth kii madad se khulavaate hai
 Both girls are excluded
 dian apane tabut se baahar aati he or khud ko bhagwaan mahashiv ke saamne paakar bhaybheet ho uthati he
 She screams with pain, and tries to run away from the temple but loses all her powers and falls down on the ground
 kuchhek palon baad, vah jalane lagati he or lagbhag hameshaa ke liye nasht ho jaati he
 In this way, the remaining Thakur family and Hemant begin a new and happy life

 duusari ore bina yuddh kiye apni sena ko swadesh lautaa le janaa donon hi desh ke shaskaon kaa apni hinata kaa dyotak jaan padaa
 So, in the interest of doing something, he decided to attack Crimea
 uske dakshini tat par sevastopol main rus kaa nausenic adda tha
 He made it his goal to do it in authority
 durdharsh nirnay to in donon deshon ne le liya par uname se kisi ko bhi kreemia ke bhubhag ke sambandh main koi jaankaree na thi
 When the ardent France experienced this difficulty, she summoned the soul of the Napoleonic great at Planchet and asked for his advice
 rephet ne sevastopol or balklawa ke jo maanchitr taiyaar kiye the unka adhyayan-manan kiya gaya; ranvyuuh-visheshgy jaimini se salaah lee gai kintu koi utsahjanak baat saamne nahin aari
 Only the possibilities of failure were realized
 idhar british mantrimandal ko kisi prakaar ke gambhir chintan kii aavashyaktaa nahin jaan padi
 He looked at the map of Crimea in the usual way and said that it is not a difficult task to cut off the peninsula of Crimea from the mainland by blocking the degree of landmass on the strength of cannons
 unhen tab tak is baat kaa gyaan na tha ki sthaldam degree ke donon ore samudr main do-teen foot se adhik jal nahin he
 He issued orders for the war
 14 sitambar ko senaayen upotoria pahaunchi
 On 17 September, he started Sevastopol and started growing
 20 sitambar ko unhone roosi sena ko haraaya kintu kisi prakaar kaa koi nirnaayak parinaam nahin niklaa
 Russian commander Tadelbein entered the fortress of Sevastopol and made full preparations to protect the fort

 at: donon deshon ke mukhyalayon se jo aadesh das din main pahonchte the ab 24 ghante main pahunchne lage
 England and France used this feature differently
 england ke liye sainik asafalataa kaa arth mantrimandal main ulatpher kii sambhaavna se adhik or kuch na tha
 Therefore, the War Department only used it to express concern for the health of its captain, Javis
 kintu france ke samrat ke liye to haar rajvansh ke vinaash kaa paigaam tha
 Hence, he began to send daily suggestions, advice and orders to his commander
 falat: donon hi deshon ke senapatiyon ko taron ke is prakaar ke aadan-pradaan ke kaaran mej se uthakar or kuch karne or sochane kii fursat hi nahin rahi
 Nevertheless, by April, they tried to speed up the circle of Sevastopol
 june main angareji sena ne radon par or francisi sena ne melecalf par akraman kiya parantu roosiyon ne donon hi akramanon ko vifal kar diya
 But when the anglo-french army took over Kinburn, Russia considered it futile to continue the war
 is samay tak french naresh napolian bhi is yuddh se ghabara uthaa tha
 He was not in favor of further war
 kintu angarej, jinhen sevastopol ke akraman main asafalataa mili thi, khize hue the
 They wanted to continue the war but it was not enough for them to fight Russia alone

 Among other things in this treaty, the main thing was that the Danube River opened up traffic for ships of all countries; Kala Sagar was declared a neutral zone; The warships of each country were prohibited

 The Crimea War was an important event in European history after the Vienna Congress
 is yuddh ke falswarup ek ore jahaan rus kii turki sambandhi yojana vifal ho gai vahiin duusari ore turki ko nav jivan praapt hua
 The Politics of Italy and Germany Unification of Russia This war had a profound effect on the complete construction of the Balkan Peninsula and on international politics
 is yuddh ke kai kaaran the
 which is like this
 rusi niti- In the 19th century, the Turkish empire was declining
 isse phayda uthaakar vibhinn europea raashtra use aapas main baantna chaahate the
 Russia was very particular about it
 vah turki ke maamle main gahari abhiruchi lene laga
 Russia wanted ki turki kamjor pad jaae taaki balcon kshetra main apni samrajya kaa vistaar kar sake
 Therefore, he provoked the subjects of the Balkan Peninsula to agitate against Turkey
 rus kaa uddeshy turki ko samaapt karnaa tha
 And on the ruins of the Turkish Empire, he wanted to build the palace of the huge Russian Empire
 is liye jab bhi mauka mila rus europea ke saamana turki ke batwaare kaa prastaav rakhata tha
 Britain's selfishness england rus kii mahatvakanksha kaa prabal virdohi tha
 Because Russia's entry into the land of the Sea could pose a crisis for England
 saath hi saath turki par rus kaa adhikaar hone se england kaa bhartiya samrajya bhi khatre main pad saktaa tha
 Therefore, he had an important role to protect Turkey from going under the authority of Russia for the protection of the Indian Empire
 england kabhi nahin chahta tha ki purv kii ore uskaa vistaar ho
 Although Russia tried to join England, it could not succeed
 vibhinn prayaason ke baad bhi jab englad rus ke paksh main nahin ho sakaa to use talwaar ke bal par turki ko hadapney kii yojana bananaa shuru kar di
 Selfishness of france europe ke biimaar raashtra turki par france kii najar bhi lagi hui thi
 Louis Napoleon wanted to expand France through war policy
 usne turki ke maamle main hastkshep karnaa shuru kiya
 The Crimean War began as a result of Napoleon's policy
 mohammal ali kaa vidroh or europea rashtron kaa turki main hastkshep- Mohammed Ali was the governor of Mishra
 jo turki samrajya ke adhin tha
 But Mohammad Ali was an independent ruler
 yunaan ke swatantraaa sangram main turki ko sahaayta dene ke babajood use koi laabh nahin hua tha
 Therefore, he took military action against Syria
 isapar turki kaa shultan ghabara gaya
 He received help from Russia
 isse vibhinn rashtron main bejaini bad gai or pramukh europea deshon ne rusi sena ko waapas karnaa ke liye turki par yah dabaav daalana shuru kiya ki ve mohammad ali ke saath samjhauta kar le
 As a result, Mohammed Ali was given Syria
 idhar rus apni sahaayta ke badale turki se kuch naa kuch puraskaar chahta tha
 In 1832 he entered into a treaty with Turkey by which Russia's influence over Turkey was established
 is ghatana se england chintit ho gaya usne europea rajyon kaa landan main ek sammelan bulaayaa
 All nations signed a treaty
 falat: turki par rus kaa prabhaav kuch kam ho gaya
 After this, peace was maintained for about ten years, but when Louis Napoleon came to France, he started raising the eastern problem by favoring the clergy of the Christianity of Russia
 The Crimea War was the result of it
 dharmik kaaran- The Holy Jerusalem of Christ was under the Turkish Empire
 vahaan roman or unani carch ke sanyasi rahete the
 The Turkish Sultan's dealings with them were not good, so according to the Treaty of 1742, the protection of the Roman monk was placed on Russia
 parantu france ke kranti ke falswarup jab france main avyavashtha fail gai
 So the Greek clergy started attacking the Roman Church
 lui nepolian ne roman padri kaa samarpan karnaa shuru kiya or rus ne unani padri kaa saath dena shuru kiya
 Hence, the Eastern problem started deteriorating
 teen varshon tak is samasya ko lekar europe main kutniti tanaav vyaapt rahaa
 Russia remained a diplomatic strain in Europe
 rus dharmik bahaanaa bana kar turki par akraman kar uske pradeshon par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha
 In 1853, Russia invaded Turkey and conquered Noldavia and Belesia
 rus par england or fransane turki ko sahaayta dene kaa aashwasan diya turki ko sahaayta dene kaa aashwasan diya 27 farvari 1854 ko england or france ne rus ko sanyukt chetavanee di ki rus turki kaa pradesh khaali kar de
 But due to lack of satisfaction, both of them declared war on Russia
 yahi yuddh kreemia kaa yuddh tha
 In which England, France and Turkey on one side and Russia alone was completely alone, this war lasted for two years
 dhan jan kii apaar kshati hui
 Russia had a massive defeat
 march 1856 main paris ke sandhi ke dwaara yuddh samaapt hua
 Thus the victory of the Egyptian nations and the defeat of Russia took place in the war
 30 march 1856 ko england, france, austria, turki, servia tathaa rus ke pratinidhiyon ne paris sandhi par hastakshar kiya
 Accordingly, the neutral zone of Kalsagar was declared
 sabhi nadi kii anterrashtriya karan kar diya gaya
 Russia's protection over the Mol Divia and Bolegia was abolished
 servia kii swatantraaa kii guarantee di gai
 Turkey was included in the nation group of Europe
 tathaa uski akhandta or swatantraaa ko sweekaar kar liya
 The Crimean War is considered an important event in European history
 is yuddh ke bare main do prakaar kii dharanaye vyakt kii gai he
 Robert Marriott described it as a total futile war of the modern era, he wrote
 “the only perfectly useless modern war that has been waged
” iske vipareet lard kromar kaa kahana he
 "if the Crimea war had not taken place, the suzerainty of Russia would have been established over Turkey", Dr
 M
 Kedelvi wrote ‘kreemia yuddh ke falswarup rus kii turki sambandhi yojanaon ko roak diya gaya
 Russia had a massive defeat
 turki ko europe ke sangrakshan main nav jivan mila nepolin kii dhak jam gai
 The national debt of England increased and Austria made an enemy of a great country
 rabart morit kaa vichaar kuch anshon main stay prathit hota he
 After the Crimea War, the fall of Turkey was inevitable
 servia ko swatantraaa pradaan kii gai
 It proved to be a source of inspiration for other subjugated countries
 or videshi apni swadhinata ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe
 The main objective of the Crimean War was to weaken Russia
 parantu yah uddeshy bhi safal nahin ho sakaa
 Thinking that Russia would calm down further proved to be wrong
 mauka milte hi vah purv samasya main pun: kud padaa paris kii sandhi kaa uddeshy rusi mahatvakankshaon par ankush lagaana tha or turki ko jivit karnaa tha parantu yah bhi pari nahin ho sakaa
 Hence it can be said
 ki jin uddeshyon kii purti ke liye yuddh ladaa gaya tha
 From that point of view it proved futile
 england yaa france kisi ko laabh nahin pahunchaa
 But despite this, Crimea war cannot be called a total futile war

 Because after this defeat, there was widespread improvement here, but the most important result of the Crimea War was that its dream of conquering Kustuntunia and making the Black Sea a Russian lake was dissolved
 england par prabhaav- The purpose of England in this war was fulfilled
 rus ke vistaar par pratibandh lag gaya lekin isse england ko dhan jan kii apaar kshati hui uskaa rashtrikar baad diya gaya jisase sudhaar yojanaayen ko lagu karne main kathinaayee hui

 patric francisi ke anusaar, ovaisi muslim samudaay ke ekmaatr pravaktaa hone ke liye jinna kii boli ke samaan ek tarah se "gaiyr-sampradayik muslim pahchaan" kii apil karata he
 His brand of Islamism along with nationalism flourishes in the old city of Hyderabad and the potential areas of radicalization of Muslim youths in Mumbai
 ovaisi ne is tathy ko uddhrut karte hue kaha ki unki ladaai bhartiya samvidhan ke dhaanche ke bheetar he
 He says that India's secular parties have not been able to transfer their votes to Muslim candidates
 2014 main chune gaye 23 muslim saansadon main se 18 yaa 1 9 nirvachan kshetron main se 30% muslim matadaata the
 While the parties claim not to discriminate against Muslims, they in practice leave Muslims in a "ghetto situation"
 isliye, muslimon ko apane swayan ke raajnneetik dal kaa vikaas karnaa chahie, obisi, daliton or yadavon ke samaan
 After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Owaisi demanded action against Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and Hafiz Saeed for killing innocent people
 He said that the enemies of the country are enemies of Muslims
 ovaisi sarkari naukariyon or shiksha sansthaanon main pichde musalamaanon ke liye aarakshan kaa samarthan karte hai
 He also says that he is against Hindutva ideology but not against Hindus
 ovaisi kaa kahana he ki bhartiya musalamaanon ko haj sabsidi ke unmoolan ke liye makka kii yatra ke liye dharmik tirthayatra par muslim mahilaon kii shiksha ke liye paise kaa istemaal karne kaa tark he
 In July 2016, Owaisi was praised for his speech for acknowledging that the Islamic State is a problem between Iraq and Levant Muslims and calls them the dogs of hell
 ovaisi ne apane bhaashan main kaha tha, jo 2016 kii saudi arab kii bambaari ke baad kuch masjidon se kya kaha ja rahaa he, kya or jo kattarpanthi jehar kaa injection laga rahaa he, nigaraanee ke liye diya gaya tha
 In August 2016, Asaduddin Owaisi expressed his displeasure at the Center for including the Ahmadiyya community as a sect of Islam in a series of tweets in India's Census 2011
 april 2017 main, gaay vadh par pratibandh ke mudde par, ovaisi ne uttar pradesh or uttar bhartiya rajyon main gaay ke rup main pavitra rup se gaay ke ilaaj main dalit hone ke liye bhaajapa kii aalochana kii, lekin purvottar, goa or kerala main pavitra nahin tha

 ovaisi vivaadon main hai or unki raajnneeti ke kaaran samachar mukhyatah musalamaanon or daliton jaise alpsankhyakon ke bich kendrit hai
 Owaisi filed a case with his younger brother Akbaruddin Owaisi in 2005 for charges of dealing with the hands of a Medak district collector

 Rama is recognized as an incarnation of God in ancient India
 hindu dharm main ram vishnu ke das avtaron main se saatven avatar hai
 The life and might of Rama is described as the Sanskrit epic Ramayana composed by Maharishi Valmiki
 goswami tulsidas ne bhi unke jivan par kendrit bhakthibhaavpurn suprasiddh mahakavy shri ramcharitamanas kii rachana kii he
 Apart from these two, Ramayana has also been composed in other Indian languages, which are also very famous
 khaas taur par uttar bharat main ram atyant poojyaneey hai or adarsh purush hai
 They are also embellished with the term Purushottam
 ram, ayodhya ke raja dasharath or rani kaushalya ke sabase bade putr the
 Ram's wife was named Sita and had three brothers - Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna
 hanuman, bhagwaan ram ke, sabase bade bhakt maane jate hai
 Rama killed Ravana, the king of Lanka
 ram kii pratishtha maryaada purushottam ke rup main he
 Rama left the kingdom, friends, parents, even wife to follow decorum
 inkaa parivaar adarsh bhartiya parivaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Ram was born in Raghukul, whose tradition was that of Pran Jahun Baru Bachnu Na Jai
 shriram ke pita dasharath ne unki sauteli mata kaikeyi ko unki kinhin do ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kaa vachan diya tha
 Kaikeyi came under the guise of maid Manthara as these vars asked King Dasaratha for his son Bharata for the throne of Ayodhya and fourteen years of exile for Rama
 pita ke vachan kii raksha ke liye ram ne khushi se chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas sweekaar kiya
 Wife Sita thought it appropriate to go to the forest with her husband, giving the example of the ideal wife
 bhai lakshmana ne bhi ram ke saath chaudaa varsh van main bitaye
 Bharata rejects Mata's order for justice and goes to the elder brother Rama in the forest and brings him to his feet
 phir ise hi raaj gaddi par rakh kar rajkaaj kiya
 When Ram was a forest dweller, his wife Sita took Ravana away
 jangal main ram ko hanuman jaisaa mitra or bhakt mila jisane ram ke saare kaary puure karaaye
 Rama finds Sita with the help of monkeys
 samudr main pul bana kar lanka pahunche tathaa ravan ke saath yuddh kiya
 After killing him, bring Sita back
 ram ke ayodhya lautne par bharat ne rajya unako hi saunp diya
 Ram was justice-loving
 unhone bahut acha shashan kiya isliye log aaj bhi achche shashan ko raamarajy kii upama dete hai
 His two sons Kush and Love handled their kingdoms
 hindu dharm ke kai tyohaar, jaise dashahra, ram navami or deepawali, ram kii jivan-katha se jude hue hai
 The word 'ram' is derived from the addition of the suffix 'ghan' in 'rum' metal
 'ram' dhaatu kaa arth raman karne se sambaddh he
 They 'raman' in the heart of a creature, therefore 'ram' and devotees 'raman' in them, therefore they are also 'ram'
 'vishnusahasranam' par likhit apane bhashya main aadya shankaracharya ne padmapurana kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki nityanandswarup bhagavan main yogijan raman karte hai, isliye ve 'ram' hai
 Rama is not mentioned in Vedic literature in the prevailing form
 rugveda main keval do sthalon par hi 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 One of them has been used in the meaning of black in one place and the remaining one in the meaning of person; But there is also no indication of his being an avatar man or Dasaratha-son
 yadhyapi nilkanth chaturdhar ne rugveda ke anek mantron ko swavivek se chunakar unke ramakthaparak arth kiye hai, parantu yah unki nijee manyata he
 The Ramakathaparaka meaning of those mantras has not been proved by any indication or any other commentary received in those cases of Rigveda itself
 rugveda main ek sthal par 'ikshvakuh' kaa tathaa ek sthal par 'dasharath' shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But there is no indication of his association with Rama
 brahman sahitya main 'ram' shabd kaa prayog aitarey brahman main do sthalon par hua he; parantu vahaan unhen 'raamo margveyah' kaha gaya he, jiskaa arth acharya sayan ke anusaar 'mrigavu' naamak stri kaa putr he
 The word 'ram' is used at a place in the Shatapatha Brahmin
 yahan 'ram' yajna ke acharya ke rup main he tathaa unhen 'ram auptpasvini' kaha gaya he
 This means that the incarnation of the prevalent Rama is due to the Valmiki Ramayana and the Puranas
 ramakatha se sambaddh sarvaadhik pramanbhoot granth adikavy valmikiy ramayana main ram-janm ke sambandh main nimnlikhit varnan uplabdh he:- xxrep 22

 Here only the position of Jupiter and Moon are clear
 brihaspati ucchsth he tathaa chandramaa swagruhi
 Further in the fifteenth verse, the Sun is mentioned to be high
 is prakaar brihaspati tathaa surya ke ucch hone kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Mercury is always near the Sun
 atah surya ke ucch hone par buddha kaa ucch hona asambhav he
 In this way, the remaining three planets - Mars, Venus and Saturn are left to grow higher
 isi kaaran se praayah sabhi vidwaanon ne ram-janm ke samay main surya, mangal, brihaspati, shukr tathaa shani ko ucch main sthit mana he
 Traditionally, Rama's birth is believed to be in Treta Yuga
 hindu dharamshastron main, visheshtah puranic sahitya main uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar ek chaturyugi main 43,20,000 varsh hote hai, jinamein kaliyug ke 4,32,000 varsh tathaa dwapar ke 8,64,000 varsh hote hai
 Rama was born in Treta Yug i
e
 before Dwapara
 chunki kaliyug kaa abhi prarambh hi hua he or ram kaa janm treta ke ant main hua tathaa avatar lekar dharti par unke vartmaan rahane kaa samay paramparaagat rup se 11,000 varsh mana gaya he
 Hence 8,64,000 years of Dwapara Yuga + 11,000 years of Rama's existence + 5,100 years since the end of Dwapara Yuga = 8,80,100 years in total
 atev paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 8,80,100 varsh pehle mana jaataa he
 Eminent Marathi researcher scholar Dr
 Padmakar Vishnu Vartak has considered this time probable from a point of view
 unka kahana he ki valmikiy ramayana main ek sthal par vindhyachal tathaa himalay kii oonchaai ko samaan bataaya gaya he
 The height of Vindhyachal is 5,000 feet and it is almost constant, while the height of the Himalayas is currently 29,029 feet and it is continuously growing
 donon kii oonchaai kaa antar 24,029 feet he
 According to experts, the Himalayas grow 3 feet in 100 years
 atah 24,029 feet badhane main himalay ko kareeb 8,01,000 varsh lage honge
 Hence, the height of the Himalayas must have been similar to that of Vindhyachal, about 8,01,000 years ago, which is mentioned in the present-day form in Valmiki Ramayana
 is tarah da0 vartak ko ek drushti se yah samay sambhav lagata he, parantu unka swayan maananaa he ki ve kisi anya strot se is samay kii pushti nahin kar sakate hai
 In his well-known treatise 'vaastav Ramayana', Dr
 Vartak has done the math on the basis of the planets, according to the planetary position mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana, to determine the actual birth date of Rama on 4 December 7323 BC
 unke anusaar isi tithi ko din main 1:30 se 3:00 baje ke bich ram kaa janm hua hoga
 After several years of research by Dr
 p
v
vartak, a research team of 'i-serve' proved Shri Ram's birth on 10 January 5114 BC using 'planetarium Gold' software
 unka maananaa tha ki is tithi ko grahon kii vahi sthiti thi jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana main he
 But this time has become very suspicious
 'ai-sarv' ke shodh dal ne jis 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog kiya vah vastav main isa purv 3000 se pehle kaa sahi grah-ganit karne main sakasham nahin he
 In fact, before 2013, there was no available software capable of doing so much earlier planetary mathematics
 is gananaa dwaara praapt grah-sthiti main shani vrishchik main tha arthath ucch main nahin tha
 The moon was not in Punarvasu Nakshatra but was in the second phase of Pushya and the date was also Ashtami
 baad main anya visheshgy dwaara ejplde431 software dwaara kii gayi sahi gananaa main tithi to navami ho jaati he parantu shani vrishchik main hi aata he tathaa chandramaa pushya ke chaturth charan main
 Therefore, the date of 10 January 5114 BCE is virtually not proved to be the birth date of Shri Ram
 aisi sthiti main ab yadi dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak dwaara pehle hi parishodhit tithi software dwaara pramanit ho jaae tabhi shriram kaa vaastavik samay praayah sarvamaanya ho paaegaa athwa pramanit na ho paane kii sthiti main naveen tithi ke shodh kaa rasta khulegaa
 There is clear evidence about the birth of Shri Ram in the Puranas that Shri Ram was born in a city called Ayodhya in Faizabad district of present-day Uttar Pradesh
 ayodhya jo ki bhagwaan ram ke purvajon kii hi rajdhani thi
 Raghu was the ancestor of Ramchandra ji
 ram bachapan se hi shant swabhaav ke vir purush the
 He always gave dignity the highest position
 isi kaaran unhen maryaada purushottam ram ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 His kingdom was considered fair and prosperous
 isliye bharat main jab bhi suraaj kii baat hoti he to ramraj yaa raamarajy kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 Rama, who followed the path of religion, received education from Guru Vasistha along with his three brothers
 kishoravastha main guru vishwamitra unhen van main rakshason dwaara machaae ja rahe utpaat ko samaapt karne ke liye saath le gayi
 Rama was accompanied by his younger brother Lakshmana in this task
 tadka naamak rakshasi baxur main rahati thi
 He was killed there
 ram ne us samay tadka naamak rakshasi ko maaraa tathaa marich ko palaayan ke liye majaboor kiya
 During this time, Guru Vishwamitra took him to Mithila
 vahaan ke videh raja janak ne apni putree sita ke vivaah ke liye ek swayamvar samaaroh yojit kiya tha
 Where Lord Shiva had a bow whose Sita was to be married to the knight who donated the emblem
 bahut saare raja maharaja us samaaroh main padhaare the
 When many kings tried to put a bow on the bow even after trying, they could not even lift it, then Rama tried to offer the bow by raising Vishwamitra's command
 unki pratyancha chadhaane ke praytn main vah mahaan dhanush ghor dhwani karte hue tut gaya
 When Maharishi Parashurama heard this loud sound, he came there and started expressing anger at his Guru's bow breaking
 lakshmana ugr swabhaav ke the
 He had a dispute with Parashurama
 tab ram ne bich-bachaav kiya
 Thus Sita was married to Rama and was blessed by all people including Parashurama
 ayodhya main ram sita sukhpurvak rahane lage
 People wanted Rama very much
 unki mridul, janasevayukta bhaavana or nyaaypriyata ke kaaran unki vishesh lokapriyata thi

 On getting the opportunity, Shriram shot an arrow and killed the deer Marich

 In order to reclaim Sita, Bhagavan Rama defeated Hanuman, Vibhishana and the monkey army with the help of Hanuman, Vibhishana and Vanara Sena, and on returning, guided Vibhishan to the good ruler by making him the king of Lanka
 bhagwaan ram ne jab ravan ko yuddh main parrast kiya or uske chote bhai vibhishana ko lanka kaa raja bana diya
 Ram, Sita, Lakshman and some monkeys departed from the Pushpak plane towards Ayodhya
 vahaan sabase milane ke baad ram or sita kaa ayodhya main rajbhishek hua
 The entire state started spending efficient time
 sita kii sati pramanikta siddh hone ke pashchaat sita apane donon putron kush or lav ko ram ke god main saunp kar dharti mata ke saath bhugarbha main chali gai
 Thereafter, the life of Ram's birth was also completed

 3
 soviet sangh ne nato ko samrajyavaadee or aakraamak deshon ke sainik sanghathan kii sangya di or use samyawad virdohi swaroop vaala ghoshit kiya
 1
 The NATO organization, created under the protection of Western Europe, strengthened the integration of Western Europe

 europe main america ke atyadhik hastkshep ne europea deshon ko yah sochane ke liye baadhya kiya ki europe kii saamaajik-aarthik samasyaon kaa samaadhaan europea drushtikon se hal kiya janaa chahie

 isi bindu par yah sawaal uthta he ki shityudh kaaleen daur main nirmit is sanghathan kaa sheet yuddh ke ant ke baad maujuud rahane kaa kya auchity he
 The role of the Natas was redefined by the US in the post-cold War era

 NATO represents the integration of the whole of Europe in the post-cold War period, which represented the integration of Western Europe during the Cold War period
 nato ke vistaar ke paksh main jo sakaraatmak bate kahi gai iske baavjood uski aalochana bhi kii jaati he
 In fact, nato's role violates the role of the United Nations in relation to peacekeeping, mutual cooperation, etc
 samajhane kii baat yah he ki sanyukt raashtra sangh kii sthapana ek antarrashtriya sanstha ke rup main kii gai, jiskaa uddeshy vishwa shanti he jabaki nato kii sthapana ek kshetreey sanghathan ke rup main kii gai

 This type of equipment and system is called home automation and the house equipped with them is called smart home
 videshon main smart homes kaa chalan bad rahaa he
 Smart homes are homes where most things are technology driven

 The entire house runs at the signal of a smart home controller
 ye niyantrak ek remote kii tarah kaam karata he jisase ghar kaa taapmaana aadi bhi vyavasthit ho jaataa he
 The success of smart homes in future will also depend on how flawless they can work

 Thus automatic houses are also frugal
 jin gharon main chote bachche or bujurg hote hai unki suraksha hetu swachaalan pranali main chaukanne alarm pranali hote hai
 Even when people are not present in the house, this house remains stationed in its work
 yah ghar keval suraksha hi nahin balki aaraam dene kaa bhi kaam karte hai
 This type of home automation system also controls the electrical system of the entire house
 inamen tach screen alsidi monitor lage hote hai jinpar puri imaarat tak ko dekha ja saktaa he or ek sthaan se hi vidyut upkarnon par niyantran rakh sakate hai
 The light will automatically open or close if there is no presence in the room through motion sensors that detect motion

 Security systems also keep the security of the house smooth
 inamen nikatadarshi camera ke saath biometric loking system or bergeller alarm bhi laga hota he
 These alarms ring with loud sirens when reaching the vault etc
 or certain rooms, crossing walls, etc
 yahaan tak ki yadi swami ghar se baahar hai to unke mobile par esemes ke dwaara sandesh aa jaataa he
 The occupants of these houses do not have to get up from their place to pull the curtains of the windows or close the doors, by pressing a button when necessary, this is done
 kuch logon ko yah suvidhaayen pasand aati hai lekin kuch kaa kahana he ki inase shaareerik kriya main rukaawat aati he or logon main aramtlabi kii aadat badhati he
 But these facilities are good for those who are physically intact
 suvidhaon ke milane par bhi is pranali kaa rakh-rakhaav mahangaa or nirantar kharchila hota he kyonki yah ghar takanic aadhaarit hote hai or inamen chote-choti marammat kii praayah aavashyaktaa padati rahati he

 According to the history, Tibet also had to fight several times in the south with Nepal and Nepal defeated it
 nepal or tibet kii sandhi ke mutabik tibet ne har saal nepal ko 5000 nepali rupee harzaana bharna padaa
 After this, the Magi, who had fought with Nepal to fight with Nepal, had escaped from Nepal with the help of China, but after this, in 1906-7, China made its authority over Tibet and established its posts in Yatung Gyadse and Gartok

 When the two families come to know about Radha and Liladhar's marriage, they ask them to stay together
 baad main lildhar ko radha se pyaar ho jaataa he
 Later, Radha agrees to stay together after saying so many times
 lekin vah mathura tabhi chalane kii baat kahati he, jab lildhar uske talaak ke kagajaat par hastakshar kar de
 At the same time, Liladhar tries to win her heart

 lekin isamen dadaji kaa vichaar use ghar se baahar phekane kaa hota he
 Grandpa gets him to sign a paper

 Under science, electronics or electronics is that area of science and technology that studies the flow of charge through different types of mediums and the devices based on them
 praudyogiki ke rup main electronic vah kshetra he jo vibhinn electronic yuktiyon aadi) kaa prayog karke upyukt vidyut paripath kaa nirmaan karne evam unke dwaara vidyut sanketon ko vaanchit tareeke se badalane se sambandhit he
 This includes the study of various types of devices, improvement of them and creation of new devices etc
 aitihaasik rup se electronic evam vaidyut praudyogiki kaa kshetra samaan rahaa he or dono ko ek duusare se alag nahi mana jaataa tha
 But now, with the expansion of new devices, circuits and the functions they perform, electronics has started to be taught as a separate branch of electrical technology
 is drushti se adhik vidyut-shakti se sambandhit kshetron ko vidyut praudyogiki ke antargat mana jaataa he jabaki kam vidyut shakti evam vidyut sanketon ke bhaanti-bhaatin ke parivartanon se sambandhit kshetra ko electronic kaha jaataa he
 Based on circuits, electronic technology is mainly divided into two parts: in paripathon main vidyut sanket satat hote hai or unka prasanskaran karne ke baad bhi ve satat hi bane rahete hai
 For example, the transistor-amplifier is an analog system
 oparational emplifire ke vikaas evam ai-si ke rup main isaki uplabdhta se analog electranix main ek kranti aa gayi
 It consists of electrical signals numeric
 ankiy sanket bahut tarah ke ho sakate hai kintu binary digital sanket sabase adhik upyog main aate hai
 Zero / one, on / off, yes / no, low / high etc
 are some examples of binary signals
 jabase ekikrut paripathon kaa pradurbhaav hua he or ek choti si chip main lakhon karondon electronic yuktiyaan bhari jane lageen hai tab se digital electronic bahut mahatvapurn ho gayi he
 Modern personal computers and cell phones, digital cameras etc
 are the product of digital electronics
 ankiy electronic ne signal-processing ko ek nayaa aayam diya he jise digital signal processing kehete hai
 It is very convenient and effective compared to analog signal processing
 electronic kaa aadhunik rup radio evam doordarshan ke vikaas ke rup main saamne aayaa
 Also, its importance emerged from the defense equipment and defense systems used in World War II
 kintu electronic kii niv bahut pehle hi rakhi ja chuki thi
 The main events and phases of the development of electronics are summarized as follows: adhiprachaar un samast soochnaaon ko kehete hai jo koi vyakti yaa sanstha kisi bade jan samudaay kii raay or vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne ke liye sanchaarit karti he
 The most effective propaganda is one whose content is often completely true, but it may also contain a small amount of false, half-truth or logical fallacy
 adhiprachaar ke bahut se tareeke hai
 The purpose of propaganda is to influence people's behavior and opinions rather than giving information
 propaganda kaa hindi main shabdic arth he prachaar, adhiprachaar athwa mat-prachaar
 Propaganda is done to propagate an idea and point of view, for a particular purpose, especially under a political purpose
 lekin isaki buniyaad aam taur par satya par nahin tiki hoti
 Propaganda began as a henchman to morally defeat the enemy's army during the war
 iske baad zikr miltaa he ki 1622 main pandrahawein pope gregory ne vatican main protestant sudhaaron ke kilaaf propaganda kaa kaam sanbhaala tha
 Propaganda's image became negative when the British government systematically propagated its letter of political interests during World War I
 kalantar main iskaa upyog chunaav-prachaar ke liye bhi hone laga
 Initially, it was used during political campaigns to garner support for the candidate's interest
 tatpashchaat isaki upyogita samajhate hue iskaa vistaar hua or ise vigyaapan kaa bhi ang bana liya gaya
 Propaganda also had a positive side when it came to advertising
 vah bhaawanaaon ko sparsh karne vaale ek sukhad ehsaas ke vaahak kii bhoomika nibhaane laga or ek khaas sandarbh main rachanaatmak ho gaya
 The basis of information provided by Propaganda has always been negative rather than historically positive
 iske madhyam se di jane vaali jaankaree praayah ek tarfaa or bhraamak prakruti kii hoti he
 Propaganda was used to promote a particular viewpoint for political reasons
 aaj propaganda kaa falak kaafii vyapak ho gaya he or iskaa upyog jaan-boojh kar kisi vyakti, sanstha, raashtra, utpaada athwa kisi raajnneetik party ke bare main nakaaratmak soochna failaane ke liye kiya jane laga he
 The other side of propaganda is that it is also seen as a special type of message
 ek aise sandesh ke rup main jise kisi vishesh samskruti, darshan, vichaar athwa mat ko kisi naare aadi ke madhyam se bazaar or samaaj main prachlit karne ke liye kiya prachaarit jaataa he
 Propaganda has been used to prove lies to be true during war
 america is propaganda kaa sabase bada prayokta mana jaataa he
 He always spreads the news during the war that he is fighting to protect humanity and fight terrorism, when his motive is something else
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan pichley do dashakon main hue iraq or afghanistan ke yudhon main dekhne ko mila
 The US has always maintained that it was necessary to fight terrorism, while the fact was that it was carrying an army of journalists who were on its side or who had been bought, along with its soldiers
 ye patrkaar apni khabaron ko live dikhaane ke naam par aisi jaankaree kaa prasaaran karte rahe jo sach nahin thi
 Such journalism itself is called jaded journalism or embedded journalism
 is tarah kii patrakarita main ek paksh kii ichha ke anusaar reporting kii jaati he or sach ko gaayab kar diya jaataa he
 Many times this journalism is also used by political parties to create public opinion in their favor
 kuch sanchaarshastriyon kii manyata he ki propaganda kaa udbhav jan-sanchaar madhyamon ke vikaas ke baad hua
 They consider it as part of communication that communication to attract public opinion is a form of propaganda
 yahan sanchaar or propegande ke sambandh par gaur karnaa zaruri he
 The invention of radio in the early twentieth century gave Propaganda a special boom
 radio ke madhyam se kaafii kam samay main ek vyapak jan-samooh tak apni baat ko pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 The development of radio not only worked to spread self-motivated and sponsored information, but it also originated the advertisement whose developed forms are in front of us in various forms today
 radio ke vikaas ke pehle itane kam samay main ek vyapak jan-samooh tak sidhe-taur par apni baat pahunchaa paanaa asambhav sa tha
 It is of course that information could also be communicated directly through the print medium, but the readers of newspapers were few
 pathak banane ke saath sakshartaa kii shart bhi judi hui thi
 Radio unveiled a new world of advertising where reading ability was not necessary
 isse vigyaapan kii pahunch or prabhaav kaa dayera aseemit ho gaya
 Along with advertising, political propaganda also expanded very rapidly
 radio ke baad propaganda ko tivi ke aagaman ne ek or nayaa oochaal diya
 TV was not able to overthrow radio, but its credibility was more authentic than radio
 badi-badi companiyon ne jab apane utpaadon ko badha-chadha kar pesh kiya to logon ne us prachaar main apni chhavi dekhni shuru kar di
 That is why advertising guru Alec Padmasi once said that when people of India become customers of something, they become less than logic and more than emotion
 unhone liril sabun ke vigyaapan kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki ‘aapako kya lagata he yah jo ladki bikni pahanakar jharne main nahaati he or neembu kii khushboo ke ehsaas jaisi tarotaza mahasoos karti he, to vah kya sachmuch vaastavik bharat ke gaanvon or shaharon main sambhav he? jahaan ek baaltee pani dhang se nahaane ke liye naseeb hota, vahaan vah neembu kii khushboo vaale ehsaas kaa anubhav kaise ho saktaa he?’ isi aadhaar par padmasi kehete hai ki vigyaapan propaganda ke madhyam se upabhokta ke saamne ek aisi chhavi nirmit kar detaa he jisamen upabhokta apni chhavi dekhne lagate hai
 In recent years, the invention of the Internet and e-mail gave Propaganda a global expansion
 masalan web-madhyamon main vah takat he jo sthaneey mudde ko vaishvik mudda bana sakati he
 Web-mediums have violated all the boundaries of geography and transformed the entire world into a small village
 kshan bhar main local se global ho jane ke liye logon ne internet pranali kaa jam kar laabh uthaaya he
 The most powerful example of how a local singer and local music has become the most popular music via the Internet in a short time is the song called Kolaberry Dee
 marketing kii bhashaa main jise ham viral marketing ke naam se jaanate hai darasal vah media kii bhashaa main propaganda hi he
 On the one hand propaganda is seen as a medium to present negative things in a positive way and on the other hand propaganda is a skill of propaganda in which a subject is presented in such a way that people are attracted towards it
 Go sambandhit vishay ko ek aisi bhashaa, lay or sangeet ke madhyam se prastut kiya jaae ki aam upabhokta apnaapan mahasoos karke us utpaada ke saath jud jaataa he
 For this, various media mediums are used
 jaise : television, radio, binar, internet, billboard, ligalet ityadi
 The negative side in this role of giving touch to emotions is only that such propaganda destroys the rationality of man and makes the emotional side more effective in his place
 america ke ek vigyaapan-lekhak tristrian toliver ne propaganda ke bare main kaha he : main hameshaa apane bare main yahi sochataa hoon ki aapako log isliye nahin pasand karte ki aapane kya kiya or unke liye kya kiya
 Rather you are always remembered for what you made them feel through your words
 masalan propaganda main yah baat bahut myne nahin rakhti kii kisi baat ko aapane kitne achche tareeke se rakhaa balki sabase mahatvapurn cheez hoti he usase nikalne vaali vah anubhuti or prerana jo logon par apni chhap chhod jaae
 The pleasant feeling of propaganda has the ability to be remembered for a long time
 is lihaaz se vigyaapan main propaganda kaa istemaal use sirf nakaaratmak na ban kar sakaaratmak rup bhi dene laga he
 According to this aspect Propaganda is the name of an entire process based on the concept of creative nature
 iskaa upyog kis prakaar se kiya janaa he— yah puri tarah upbhogakarta par nirbhar karata he
 Anti-capitalist color french postcard : pratham vishwayuddh ke samay main germany ke wilhem dwitiya ko dharti ko munh se katate hue dikhaaya gaya he
 America's propaganda poster against Hitler in World War II 'soye hue hathi uth ja' : japani poster jisamen aaazaad hind fouj ko hathi ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he, jisane soond se jon bul ko hawa main uthaa liya he

 Sliding mark or skid mark is the mark when a solid object moves against another
 jaise kii koi gaadi
 Skid roads have marks caused by tires when a vehicle stops rolling the wheel and slides or rotates on the road surface
 skid ank adhiktam or nunatam vaahan kii gati ek prabhaav yaa ghatana se pehle pataa lagane ke liye vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Glide can also occur on black snow or on diesel deposits on the road and there are no marks
 skid nishaan "twaran ke nishaan" twaran se hone vaale ko kaha jaataa he jaataa he
 The engine can transmit tires and provides maximum power; "braking marks," if the brake lock "and cause the tire to slide; or" yaw marks ", if the tire slides sideways
 har ek visheshta upasthiti he, or ek anbhavi durghatana nirmaataa yaa forencik ejeeniyar aksar nirdhaarit kar sakate hai kya vaahan ke nishaan tair dwaara choda pareekshan karke kar rahaa tha
 In a car accident, skid marks are much like leaving a piece of rubber on a rubber paper, due to the rubber being deposited on the road
 skid nishaan bhi jab ek car achaanak ek phislan sataha par twaran, yaa ek hard kone letaa he ke bare main aa sakate hai
 Skid scars can also be formed where a ladder suddenly slips and the user falls to the ground
 is tarah ke nishaan vaahan durghatana punarnirmaan ke liye mahatvapurn sakshya hai
 The length of the skid mark is usually closely related to the speed of the vehicle at the moment of braking, therefore measuring the mark yields an estimate of the original speed
