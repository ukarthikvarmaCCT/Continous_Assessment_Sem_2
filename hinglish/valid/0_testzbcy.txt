 More broadly, the highest and lowest members of a set are the highest and lowest values among the members of that set
 falnon ke charam maanon ko nikaalnaa hi ishtatmakaran kaa uddeshy he
 We consider the following function sabase pehle ham is falan kaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai or usko shunya ke baraabar rakhkar sambhavit ucchisht / nimnisht kaa pataa lagaate hai
 To make sure that x = 0 is superimposed on / low, we assume the second derivative of this function at x = 0 and see if the second derivative is positive or negative at both points
 nimnlikhit falan ko lete hai- Let's find the first derivative of: falan kaa dwitiya avkalaj yah he: Keeping the first derivative zero, the value of x gives the following: x 1 = 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_{1}={ \ sqrt { \ frac {1}{2 xxrep 4 } par falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan rinatmak he, atah x=x_1 par is falan kaa ucchisht he
 Similarly we see that the value of the second derivative of the function at x 2 = - 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_ {2} = - { \ sqrt { \ frac {1} {2 xxrep 4 } is positive, so the function at x_2 The following is nimnlikhit falan par vichaar karen jiskaa graph saamne diya gaya he- First of all, we find the first derivative of this function and keep it equal to zero and find the possible high / low
 is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki x = 0 par ucchisht / nimnisht he, ham is x=0 par is falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan nikaalte hai or dekhte hai ki yah dhanatmak he yaa rinatmak
 Therefore, we conclude that this function has neither high nor low

 In today's open source software, doing all the work done at the office, writing, going to the internet, giving different types of powerpoint presentation, listening to songs, watching dvds, blogging, or anything else that we all want to do Is as simple as proprietary software
 The best thing is that there is no problem of intellectual property rights and there is no question of committing the common man from spending money and theft of software

 FOSS / FLOSS: free software, open sorce software he par har open sorce software, free software nahin he
 GPL for free software Must be published under license, but open source software can also be published under many other types of licenses
 donon main antar to he par sambandh bhi gaharaa he
 All this has started with free software, so such software is called Free Open Source Software or FOSS for short

 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest will not be excluded from its development
 


so open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It’s still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people's rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that does not mandate legal protection for such secrecy

 isamen ve free software kii kamiyon ko is tarah se varnan karte hai, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
 ' yah to kahana mushkil he ki software udyog kis taraf jaayegaa parantu duniya ke bahut saare desh tathaa vyapaar gharaane open sorce software ko apana hissaa bana rahe hai

 Aitareya Aranyak has also included "aitareya Upanishad" within him
 aitarey aranyak ke paanch avaantar khand hai jo swayan aaranyak ke naam se hi abhihit kiye jate hai

 aitarey brahman kii rachana karanevaale mahidas aitarey hi is aaranyak ke pratham teen anshon ke bhi rachayita hai
 As a result, it is reasonable to consider Aitareya Aranyak as a contemporary of Aitareya Brahmana
 is aaranyak ko nirukt se pracheen maanane kaa kaaran yah he ki iske tritiy khand kaa pratipaadya vishay, jo vaidic vyakaran he, praatishakhya tathaa nirukt donon ke tadvishyak vivaran se ni:andeh pracheen he

 The communities of Persian-speakers living in Tajik Central Asia are called
 bahut se afghanistan se aaye tajik sharnaarthi iran or pakistan main bhi rahete hai
 Tajik people have a deep connection with the people of Iran in terms of their culture and language
 china ke tajik log anya tajik logon se zaraa bhinn hote hai kyonki ve purvi irani bhashaayen bolte hai jabaki anya tajik farsi bolte hai
 Tajik people are descendants of the ancient Sogdai, Bactrians and Parthians who speak eastern Iranian languages
 iran ke shaktishaalee hakhaamani or saasaani samrajyon ke prabhaav se ve samay ke saath-saath farsi ke bhinn rup bolne lage, jo ek pashchimi irani bhashaa he
 Nevertheless, in Tajiki Persian, there are many words of ancient Sogdai and Parthiai, which are not found in Iranian Persian
 madhya asia main iraniyon ke alaava doosraa bada prabhaav turki bhashiyon kaa rahaa he
 Turks gave the name 'tajik' to Persian-speakers and it meant 'non-turkish'
 kisi jamaane main 'tajik' shabd ko ek gaali mana jaataa tha lekin jab tajikistan soviet sangh kaa bhaag bana to ise garv se madhya asia main bas rahe farsi-bhashiyon kii pahchaan ke liye istemaal kiya jane laga
 The word 'tajik' has remained respectable since the same Soviet era
 tajik log farsi kii ek purvi upbhasha bolte hai, jise 'dari' yaa 'dari farsi' kaha jaataa he
 The word 'dari' is made by shrinking the word 'darbari'
 tajikistan main tajiki bhashaa ko likhane ke liye sirilik lipi istemaal kii jati he, haalaanki puraane jamaane main ise arabi-farsi lipi main likhaa jaataa tha
 The modern Tajik language has deep influences from the Russian language, the Uzbeki language and the Uygur language
 kuch farsi-bhashi log tajiki ko irani farsi se zyaada shuddh maanate hai, kyonki iran par arab akraman or qabze ke baad bahut baari arabi bhashaa kaa prabhaav padaa
 Arabic words are less in Tajik Persian than in Iranian Persian and more are of ancient Persian origin
 tajikistan main do tarah kii farsi boli jaati he
 One is the daily spoken Persian, which is called 'zaban-e-kucha', that is, 'language of street-couches'
 duusari aupchaarik taur par bole jane vaali 'zabaan-e-adbi' he, yani 'adab kii bhashaa'
 Historically, ancient Aryan religion, Buddhism and Zarathushtri religion have been emphasized among the Tajik people
 islam ke aane ke baad adhiktar tajik log sunni muslim ban gaye, haalanki inamen shiya musalmaan bhi paae jate hai
 In 2005, Tajikistan had a population of 95% Sunni and 3% Shia
 dhyaan dijiye ki yah iran kaa ulta he, jahaan zyaadaatar log shiya hai
 About 90 percent of the world's leather is made from the skins of large animals, such as bovine animals, and sheep and goats, but horse, boar, kangaroo, reindeer, reptile, sea horse, and seaweed skins are also used as a modus operandi
 kuch apwaadon ko chhodkar, khaalen maance udyog kii upjaat hai
 If they were the staple product, leather would be very expensive
 upjaat hone ke kaaran unamem kuch dosha bhi praaia: paae jate hai, jaise pashusanvardhak log khaal ke sarvottam bhaag, puththon ko daag lagaakar bigaad daalate hai
 Due to their inadvertence, insects pierce into the molten skin
 usko chhilne yaa pakaane sukhaane ke samay keei or dosha kaa aana sambhav he
 The skins have two distinct layers, which have a different origin and configuration: chamada vastav main isi tah kaa banataa he
 In making leather, separate the hair and epidermis completely and purify the corium by peeling off the fat tissue and flesh beneath the corium, in which it becomes antiseptic
 sookhe korium main kam se kam 85 pratisht colejan naamak tantu-protein hota he
 Its actual leather is made
 baaki 15 pratishat bhaag main jalasanyojak utak, vasa, carbohydrate, khanij, bacteria, anzime ityadi sammilit rahete hai
 Collagen converts to gelatin in its natural untreated condition after watering
 at: charmshodhan dwaara ise jalpratirodhi banaate hai
 Corium is a white filament-made structure, which is the success of pre-refinement work in separating it without causing damage
 bhinn-bhinn khaalon ke korium main sanyojak utak tathaa vasiy padaarthon kii maatra newnaadhik haati he
 It is important to have connective tissue in the skins in terms of tanning
 iske reshe colejan se bheetar ke bhaag elastin naamak pile rang ke protein ke bane hote hai
 The amount of elastin has an effect on both the tension and elasticity of the leather
 khaal main vasakoshikaon kaa bhi apana pruthak mahatv he
 For example, if a large group of them is radiated into collagen fibers in a skin, its leather will certainly become soft and spongy; The reason is that in the early work of pre-tanning, the removal of adipocyte will create numerous small spaces, which will make the skin supple
 vyapaar main, chamada kamanaa aarambh karne ke pehle, khaalon kaa bade pariman main sanchayan anivaary he
 In this, care has to be taken that the skins do not rot before earning
 iske liye khaalon kaa asthaayee parirakshan kiya jaataa he
 The common remedy is treatment with salts
 sarvottam badi yaa bachhadon kii khaalon par, chhalane kii turant baad, sookhaa namakchurna chhidakkar unhen pack kar dete hai, yaa ati santrupt namak ke vilyan main unhen rakh dete hai
 If you have to keep it for a long time, then spread or hang saline skins in the shade
 isamen khaalon ko kshay yaa keetkshati se bachaane ke liye arsenic vilyan kaa upachaar vaanchhneeya he
 The process of tanning consists of three stages: 'sahi chamada' ko in teenon prakriyaaon se hokar janaa padataa he
 In addition, a fourth process may also be known as 'coating'
 chamade ko kin prakriyaaon se janaa padegaa yah is baat par nirbhar he ki kis prakaar kaa chamada bananaa he
 The cleaned skins of animals, large or small, are made by chemical processing to "earn" leather
 bina kamai khaal sadane lagati he
 60 degrees c The skin dissolves almost completely in the heat, but the earned leather does not rot
 ardra avasthaa main bhi uskaa jeevanu-puyan nahin hota or na vah jal main viley hoti he
 Many leathers remain unchanged even at the boiling point of water
 kamaane se chamade main kuch moulik gun, jaise majbootee, tanaav samarthy, pratyasthata, apagharshankrodh ityadi bhi aa jate hai
 Opening the bundles of skins, inspect each skin first to find out the defect
 doshayukt bhaag or aise chor, jinase chamada nahin banataa, jaise kaan or khur, ko katkar gelatin yaa sares nirmaataa ke paas bhej dete hai
 The remaining skins are washed several times with cold water in the rotting pus
 pipon main khuntiyon kaa aisa prabandh rahata he ki khaalen nirantar mudati or alag khinchati rahen
 Solutes also add some resistance to water for the control of antibacterial proteins
 dhene ke pashchaat khaalon ko bade bade kundon main, saapekshat: thande akshareey jal main dubokar, phulate hai
 The purpose of these activities is to completely remove the preservative salt, blood and lymphoid proteins, dung or other external substances and to inflate the skins to make them soft, supple and pre-shaped and ayam
 kabhi kabhi bhigona or dhonaa duhraana bhi padataa he, kintu khaalon kaa atyadhik utfullan rokane ke liye vivekpurna jalshoshan or jeevanupuyan kaa drudh niyantran anivaary he
 The puffed skins rub away the unnecessary fat or flesh on the underside by handcuffs, or bladed rotating cylinders
 iske liye khalon ko bade kundon main jal or buje hue chooney kii paryaapt maatra ke saath vilodit karte hai
 Lime-water should always be saturated
 chuunaa-upachaar kaa anukultam taap 18 degree sein
 bataaya jaataa he
 The action of lime-water dissolves the layer of the epidermis and the roots of the hair become loose as a result of the easy alkylation of a protein called keratin
 chooney kii kriya main tivrata laane ke liye chooney kaa lagbhag dashamansh sodium sulphide bhi kundon main gholte hai
 Its hydrolysis produces sodium hydrosulfide, which accelerates the speed of capillaries
 iske uchit prayog se bal viley yaa vighatit hokar aasaani se nikal jate he, kintu chamada udyog ko is bahumoolya upjaat kii haani uthaani padati he
 Nams and blankets are made from hair
 bhed kii khaal kaa mukhya utpaadan oon he
 Therefore, by applying a thick paste of lime and sodium sulfide on the underside of each skin, wrap the skins inside the paste and leave it for a few hours
 lep kaa oon se nunatam sparsh hona chahie
 As a result, the hydrosulfide diffuses into the skin to dissolve the wool holding cells, and the wool is readily collected
 ab khaal ko baalo kii ore paribhrami, kund tathaa sarpil falon dwaara ragadkar deele hue baalo ko hataate hai
 After this, to redeem the remaining cries, the skins are forcefully peeled from top to bottom with blunt knives, laying on an arched, sloping slab

 sabhi mote chamadon kaa, jinamein tale, patte or masini chamade sammilit hai, prishthiya chuunaa-niraakaran aavashyak he, anyathaa shodhak dravon ke sampark se unka vivarnan ho jaataa he
 But for light skin full transverse cut should be dismantled, for which the following actions are necessary: is kriya main khaalon ko kundon yaa pipon main amlon, lavenon or purvanirdhaarit maanakit anzimon se upachaarit karte hai
 This leads to removal of degradation products of the epidermis, hydrolysis of elastic fibers, control of ph, and degradation of skin effusion
 yah visheshat: krom charmpak ke purv kiya jaataa he
 In this, the skins are diluted in casks with dilute sulfuric acid and salt, and the acidity is brought out
 is antim safai se chamade main komalta badhati he
 This is the chemical change that results in leather
 pracheenatam kaal main iske liye keval vanaspati varg ke padaarth prayukt hote the, kintu aadhunik audyogiki ne charmpak ke liye anek rasinic dravyon kaa avishkaar kiya he
 Nowadays, most leather is made using the chrome method, but some leather is still made by botanical tanning: pracheen kaal main charmpak ke liye ekmaatr vanjulachaal prayukt hoti thi, kintu ab anya anek vanaspatik padaarthon kaa upyog hota he
 They are mainly divided into three categories in Perkin: ilaagi tanninon kaa ek gun yah he ki inke upachaar se chamade par elagic amla kaa ek ravedaar, prishthiya nikshep ban jaataa he, kintu anya donon virgon ke tanninon se nahin banataa
 The leather prepared from this deposit gives firmness, but if the leather is to be dyed later, it becomes obstructive
 sanshlisht tannin - inamen ek jati kii tannin sintens kehalaati he
 It is made by mixing phenolsulfonic acid and formaldehyde
 charmpak ke liye yah ekantik rup se prayukt nahin haati, kintu krom athwa vanaspatipaachit chamade ke punarpaak main atyadhik upyogi he
 In addition to rapid penetration and enhancement of leather, a number of desired savings can be made by these subsidiary parks
 duusari sanshlisht tanninen regin varg kii hai
 Their future is promising in the manufacture of leather of various desirable qualities
 vanaspatik charmpak prakriya - tale, patte, mashiinon yaa gaddi ke mote chamadon ke liye greatbritain main baari khaalon kii chuunaa upachaar ke pashchaat hi kaat chhant kar lete hai
 The main and best part for these works is the puttas, which have different recipes
 baaki lagbhag aadhe kshetrafal main pet or kandhon ke bhaag hote hai
 They make leather of light works, such as shoe tops, lining, binding leather, attractive items etc
 in halke bhaagon or choti khaalon kaa charmpak bina kaate chhante hi kar lete hai
 Then if their thickness is more than required, then the crushing machine make flat layers of desired thickness
 vanaspatik charmpak ke sampurna prakram main, aapekshik ghanatv or amlata ankit karanevaale upkarnon dwaara charmpak dravon kii sandratha yatharthatapurvak niyantrit rakhte hai
 It is used in three ways: in khaalon kaa chuunaa niraakaran purna karne ke liye inhen jal se or kabhi kabhi amla se bhi dhote hai
 They are then run in suspension floats for two to seven days in pre-used vegetative culinary fluids, then complete their digestion in the more concentrated liquids of the Hastan Kundas, then complete their digestion in the more concentrated liquids of the Hastan Kundas
 ant main chamade kaa rang halakaa karne ke liye usko peepen yaa kunda main sumakh ke ushn nishek dwaara punarpaak karte hai
 Since most of such leathers are later dyed, such a condition is not created to form surface deposits
 bhed kii chiri hui khal kii danayukt parat, skiwar, kaa charmpak - chuunaa upachaar ke baar hi chiraai mashin dwaara ye paraten praapt hoti hai
 The area of the folded layers is equal, but the thickness is less
 skiwaron kaa mukhya upyog jildasaji main hota he
 First they wash the whole lime by washing it with water and acidification, then in a paddle cycle for parchment, 60 degrees Celsius from the powder of the Sumakh Papers
 But they dissipate with Nishek
 praat: 12 ghanton main charmpak purna hota he
 Then the skin is allowed to dry by washing and washing it
 is prakaar praapt safed chamada kisi bhi rang main rangaa ja saktaa he
 Sometimes chrompacs also perform a botanical baking of leather
 aise sanyukt paak se chamade main donon ritiyon se praapt honevaale gun aate hai, jaise kisi vishisht tale ke chamade ko sanyukt paak dwaara krom chamade jaisi gharshanrodhakta or vanaspati dwaara pakv chamade jaisi vardhit motaai dete hai
 Although chrome tanned is used for most light skins nowadays, the leather of gloves is still made from the ancient method of mineral cooking
 isamen taiyaar khaal ke 100 bhaag ke saath 8 bhaag fitkaree, 8 bhaag namak, 3 se lekar 5 bhaag tak aataa or 2 se lekar 4 bhaag tak andpit paribhrami peepe main daalkar do ghante tak chalaane se chamada banataa he
 Dry it after discharge
 vyapaar main yah mukhyat: bakre or bachade kii khaalon ke shodhan main prayukt hoti he, jisaki aadhunik vidhi yah he : In the first section, 100 parts of acidified skins are rotated in pus or paddle circles with a mixture of dilute solution of 6 parts sodium bicromate and 1
75 parts sulfuric acid, so that the absorption is complete and the color of the skins turns bright orange
 tab unhen nikaalkar 24 ghante tak nissarit karke mashin dwaara failaate hai ki dane samtal ho jaayan or sikudan nikal jaay
 Thereafter, in the second passage, they are stirred with a dilute solution of 15 parts sodium thiosulfate in casks etc
 upar se ek bhaag salfurik amla jal main mila hua dekar phir chalaate hai
 Similarly, give one part of acid twice more in about one hour
 chamade kaa rang ant main feekaa nila haraa ho jaataa he
 The specialty of this method is that the chromic acid that is formed by the action of bicromate and acid in the first layer and absorbed into the skin is reduced by the sulfuric acid formed by the action of thiosulfate and acid in the second layer, and converted to chalky chromium sulfate
 Gets deposited in fibers
 saath hi thayosulphate ke upchayan se tetrathayonnet banataa he or unmukt gandhak bhi tantuon ke upar or andar nikshipt hota he
 This is the hallmark of leather made by double avgah
 yah vidhi saral he, adhik prachlit he or isse nishchit gunwale chamade banate he
 It has direct action on the skins of coaxial chromium salts, respectively increasing in concentration
 is reeti main bhi charmpak ghoomte hue peepe ityadi main karte hai or pakdrav ke tanu vilyan se prarambh karke sandratha badhaate jate hai ki vedhan purna ho jaay
 a common dish is formed as follows: ek sisa madhi tank main pehle 100 pound sodium bicromet ko 25 galen jal main gholte hai, tab 100 pound salfurik amla ko alag 25 galen jal main dhire dhire milakar pehle vilyan main daalate hai
 When frosty, 25 pounds of glucose are also left in it until the initial orange color of the solution changes to a bright dark green color
 krom charmpak drutagami prakram he
 This can provide micro-controlled products
 krom chamade apwaad rup se gharshan or rasinic kriyarodhi hote hai
 Their stress capacity is high and they can tolerate high temperature, without loss, even in dry and humid conditions
 kachi khaal se telon ke prayog dwaara chamada bananaa pracheenatam prakram he
 Now-a-days leather is made by this method
 bhed, hiran ityadi ke aantarik chirao ko mand kshareey sthiti main laakar machhlee ke kisi oxikaraniya tej, jaise cod tel, se tar karke, tel ko tantuon par upachayit karte hai
 In this, after making the preparations before the parchment, the skins are treated with the solvents dissolved in solvents like acetone
 isamen vedhan or charmpak ati drut hone ke kaaran taiyaar chamade main satvar parivartan karnaa sambhav he

 ye paanch vyakti the naanaa sahib, ajimullah khan, bala sahab, tathya tope tathaa babu kunwar singh
 The negotiations went on for a long time and it was here that it was decided to prepare the ground for armed revolution against the Firangi government and then on a certain day, the trumpet of revolution would be played together in the whole country
 jansadharan tathaa aryavartiya sainikon main is kranti kii aawaaj ko pahunchane ke liye 'roti tathaa camel' kii bhi yojana yaheen taiyaar kii gai
 The main role in this entire discussion was that of Swami Dayanand Saraswati
 vichaar vimarsh tathaa yojana-nirdhaaran ke uparant swami ji to haridwar main hi ruk gaye tathaa anya paanchon rashtriya netaa yojana ko yatharth rup dene ke liye apane-apane sthanon par chale gaye
 After his departure, Swamiji established contact with some of his trusted ascetics and formed a secret organization
 is sanghathan kaa mukhyalay indraprastha main mahrauli sthit yogamaya mandir main banaaya gaya
 This headquarters played a notable role in the freedom struggle
 swami ji ke netritv main saadhuon ne bhi sampoorn desh main kranti kaa alakh jagaaya
 He used to carry the messages of revolutionaries from one place to another, encouraging them and if necessary, he himself would take up arms and fight with the British
 san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn avadhi main rashtriya netaa, swami dayanand saraswati ke nirantar sampark main rahe
 Even Swami was not disappointed at the failure of freedom struggle
 unhen to is baat kaa pehle se hi abhas tha ki keval ek baar praytn karne se hi swatantrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 For this, a long process of struggle will have to be carried out
 haridwar main hi 1855 kii baithak main babu kunwar singh ne jab apane is sangharsh main safalataa kii sambhaavna ke bare main swami ji se poocha to unka bebaak uttar tha "swatantrata sangharsh kabhi asafal nahin hota
 India has gradually become a revolution in a hundred years
 ab isko swatantra hone main bhi ek sau varsh lag jaaenge
 Many precious lives will be sacrificed in the attainment of this freedom
 " swami ji kii yah bhavishyavaanee kitni sahi nikali, ise baad kii ghatnaon ne pramanit kar diya
 After the failure of freedom struggle, when Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and other national leaders met Swamiji, he also advised them not to get discouraged and wait for the right time
 1857 kii kranti ke do varsh baad swami ji ne swami virajanand ko apana guru banaaya or unase diksha lee
 Staying in Swami Virjanand's ashram, he studied the Vedas, meditated on them and after that, according to the instructions of his Guru, he started propagating Vedic knowledge
 isi uddeshy kii prapti ke liye unhone arya samaaj kii bhi sthapana kii or uske madhyam se samaaj-sudhaar ke anek kaary kiye
 He campaigned strongly against untouchability, sati, child marriage, male sacrifice, religious parochialism and superstitions and he supported widow marriage, religious generosity and mutual brotherhood
 in sabake saath swami ji logon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharne se bhi kabhi nahin chookte the
 In the beginning, many people put various obstacles in Swami ji's social reform work and opposed them
 dhire-dhire unke tark logon kii samaj main aane lage or virodh kam hua
 His popularity continued to grow
 isse angrej adhikariyon ke man main yah ichha uthi ki agar inhen angreji sarkaar ke paksh main kar liya jaae to sahaj hi unke madhyam se jansadharan main angrejon ko lokapriy banaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, the British officers had likewise joined some other sermons and religious officials by giving different kinds of temptation
 unhone swami dayanand saraswati ko bhi unheen ke samaan samajha
 Accordingly, Swamiji was met through the then Governor General Lord Northbrook through a Christian priest
 yah mulaakaat march 1873 main kalakatta main hui
 After some formal talk here and there, Lord Northbrook humbly put his point before Swamiji - "in the beginning of your lecture, you will be able to pray for the welfare of the English government in the God you pray
 " Swami ji readily understood everything by listening to the Governor General
 unhen angreji sarkaar kii buddhi par taras bhi aayaa, jo unhen thik tarah nahin samaj saki
 He boldly and firmly replied to the Governor General- governor general ko swami ji se is prakaar ke tikhe uttar kii aashaa nahin thi
 The meeting was terminated immediately and Swamiji returned from there
 iske uparant sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag kii swami ji par tathaa unki sanstha arya-samaaj par gahari drushti rahi
 Records of each of his movements and every word he spoke began to be kept
 aam janata par unke prabhaav se sarkaar ko ahsaas hone laga ki yah baagi fakir or aryasamaj kisi bhi din sarkaar ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Therefore, various types of conspiracies were started to eliminate Swamiji
 swami ji kii mrityu jin paristhitiyon main hui, usase bhi yahi abhas miltaa he ki usamen nishchit hi agreji sarkaar kaa koi shadyantr tha
 Swami ji died on October 30, 1883, at dusk on the day of Deepawali
 un dinon ve jodhpur naresh maharaj jaswant singh ke nimantran par jodhpur gayi hue the
 His frequent discourses were there
 yadakada maharaj jaswant singh bhi unke charnon main baithkar vahaan unke pravachan sunate
 Two or four times Swamiji also went to the state palaces
 vahaan par unhone nanheen naamak veshya kaa anaavashyak hastkshep or maharaj jaswant singh par uskaa atyadhik prabhaav dekha
 Swamiji felt it very bad
 unhone maharaj ko is bare main samajhaayaa to unhone vinamrata se unki baat sweekaar kar lee or nanheen se sambandh tod liye
 This led to a lot of opposition against the little Swamiji
 usne swami ji ke rasoie kaliya urf jagannatha ko apni taraf mila kar unke doodh main pisa hua kaanch dalava diya
 Shortly afterwards Swami came to confess his crime and apologized for it
 udaar-hriday swami ji ne use raah-kharch or jivan-yaapan ke liye paanch sau rupye dekar vahaan se vidaa kar diya taaki police use pareshaan na kare
 Later, when Swamiji was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, the concerned doctor also remained under suspicion
 us par aarope tha ki vah aushadhi ke naam par swami ji ko halkaa vish pilaataa rahaa
 Later, when Swamiji's health started deteriorating, he was brought to the hospital in Ajmer
 magar tab tak kaaphi vilamb ho chukaa tha
 Swamiji could not be saved
 is sampoorn ghatnakram main ashanka yahi he ki veshya ko ubhaarne tathaa chikitsak ko bargalane kaa kaary angreji sarkaar ke ishaare par kisi angrej adhikari ne hi kiya
 Otherwise it was not possible for an ordinary prostitute to do such a conspiracy against a well-known and popular person like Swami Dayanand Saraswati only on his own
 bina kisi protsaahan or sangrakshan ke chikitsak bhi aisa dussahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 The body of Swami Dayanand ji, the pioneer of Swadharma, Swabhasa, Swarashtra, self-culture and indigenous promotion, merged into Panchatatva on the day of Diwali in 1883 and he left behind a principle, Krishnamanto Vishwamaryam - that is, make the whole world the best human
 unke antim shabd the - "prabhu! tuune acchhee lila kii
 May your wish be fulfilled
