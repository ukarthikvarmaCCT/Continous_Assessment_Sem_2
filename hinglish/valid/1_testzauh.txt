 According to a section of scholars, the primitive man must have known the art of marking by accident; It is such that his finger would have been burnt by the incomplete wood at the time of burning the fire or he would have used ashes to stop the blood when a thorn and once the wound was healed, it would have started to be used for decoration

 In 1995, Wells et al
 Initially developed a predictive rule based on medical criteria to predict the likelihood of PE
 The prediction rule was revised in 1998
 This prediction rule was later simplified over 2000 years during its validation by Wells et al

 More recently, a later study overturned Wales' initial use of a 4 point cutoff to construct only two categories
 PE ke liye geneva niyam jaise atirikt bhavishyavaanee niyam hai
 More importantly, the use of either rule is associated with a recurrent decrease in thromboembolism

 On echocardiography in severe and somewhat less severe PE, stagnation of the right side of the heart can be seen, an indication that the pulmonary artery is severely obstructed and unable to match the heart pressure

 In contrast to the Wells score and the Geneva score, which are future predictive predictors of classifying the risks of patients suspected of having PE, the PERC rule is designed to address the risk of PE in patients when the physician has already presented them with a lower risk
 Those are classified in class

 If another case of PE is present under warfarin treatment, the INR window may be increased to 2
5–3
5 for example, or the anticoagulation is converted to a different anticoagulant, for example low molecular weight heparin
 Low-molecular-weight heparin course therapy on warfarin may be supported based on the results of a clot test for a patient with an underlying malignancy

 This figure is a trial published in 1960 by Barritt and Jordan, which compares anticoagulation against experimental drugs for the management of PE

 This study is the only experimental drug controlled trial that examines the location of anticoagulants in the treatment of PE and the results are so reliable that the test is never repeated as if it was an unethical practice
 It is said that the reported 26% mortality rate in the experimental drug group is probably blatant and reported that today's technology has only identified severe pes

 However, he also built the Samadhi of a Samant named Balaji Awaji, whose letter of apology was received by Chhatrapati Sambhaji after the death of those feudal lords

 Panchagyanandriya senses the form, rasa, smell touch and words of these five panatmantras, panchavishyas or the five senses, and the gross ghosts due to which these panchatnamatras are expressed are called Panchatattva

 Chinese scholars also considered the Five Elements in the olden times, as the article shoe-qing shows from 2,000 years before Christ
 samast bhautik sristi ke muladhar tatv the: prithvi, agni, jal dhaatu or kashtha
 These scholars never tried to give a clear definition of the word tattva

 Paracelsus considered three or four elements, whose bases were considered salts, sulfur and mercury
 ye teenon kramash: sthirataa, dahan yaa jvalan, evam dravatv yaa vashpashiltaa ke gunon se sambandh rakhte the
 Similar ideas continued to be found in France and England in the 17th century
 dow wilis ne muladhar sakriy tatv ye maane : paara yaa spirit, gandhak yaa tel or lavan tathaa inke saath niskriy tatv jal yaa kaph or mitti bhi maane
 JB Van Helmont considered water to be the main element and also considered salt, sulfur and mercury as water
 hawa ko bhi unhone tatv mana
 The most obvious idea regarding the element was put forward by Robert Boyle in 1661 AD
 usne tatv kii paribhaasha yah di ki ham tatv unhen kahengen, jo kisi yantric yaa rasinic kriya se apane se bhinn do padaarthon main vibhajit na kiye ja saken
 The stall considered four elements were acid, water, earth and phlogiston
 yah antim tatv vastuon ke jalane main sahaayak hota tha
 Chemists began preparing a list of elements, following Robert Boyle's definition
 bahut samay tak pani tatv mana jaataa rahaa
 Priestley produced oxygen gas in 1774 AD

 Lavvaje explained the major differences between compound and element in 1789 AD

 In the 19th century, Sir Humphrey Davy also separated sodium, the basic element of salt, and showed calcium and potassium by separating them from compounds
 davy ke samay ke purv chlorine ke tatv hone main andeh mana jaataa tha
 People believed it to be oxymuritic acid, as it was formed by the oxidation of muriatic acid, but Dewey proved that chlorine is the element
 prakruti main kitne tatv ho sakate hai, iskaa pataa bahut dinon tak rasayanagyon ko na tha
 Therefore, many such elements were also announced in the history of the discovery of elements, which we do not consider as elements today

 The discovery of radioactive elements made it clear that the element is not inseparable by Boyle's definition
 prakruti main uranium vibhakt hokar swayan duusare tatwon main parinat hota rahata he
 Experiments have also made it possible that we can divide elements and create new elements in our laboratories
 uranium ke aage 8-9 tatwon ko kritrim vidhi se banaaya bhi ja sakaa he

 Ganga Dynasty was a noted dynasty of South India
 iskaa rajya 350 i se 1000 i tak astitvamaan tha
 Perhaps this dynasty was a branch of the Ichhvaku dynasty of Nagarjuni Kond which established its independent existence by taking advantage of political instability during the southern campaign period of the Gupta emperor Samudragupta
 kintu is vansh ne gang naam kyon or kis prakaar dhaaran kiya, yah agyaat he
 But some people imagine the association of this name with the name of the river Ganges

 He was not only a scholar of ethics but also a scholar of the Upanishads

 For a few days, he held the charge of Uparaj
 apane uparaj kaal main usne baan naresh jagadekamal ko parrast kiya tha
 The prosperity of the state reached its peak during his reign

 Perhaps the Rashtrakutas began to attack Gangawadi, being enamored by this Shree Vriddhi

 After Shripurush, his son Shivmar became the second official

 When Rashtrakuta Govind's quarrel with his elder brother Pillar over the question of sovereignty arose, Govind released him but upon release Shivmar favored the pillar

 As a result, Amoghavarsha i had to marry his daughter Chandrobelabba to Butug I, son of Nitimarg I

 He was a great mathematician, physicist, astrologer and philosopher
 inkaa shodh prapatr "prakritik darshan ke ganitiya siddhanton "" san 1687 main prakashit hua, jisamen saarvatrik gurtvakarshan evam gati ke niyamon kii vyakhya kii gai thi or is prakaar chirsmmat bhautikee kii neenv rakhi
 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus
 unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa bhi pradarshan kiya or ek falan ke shunyon ke sanniktan ke liye tathakthith "newton kii vidhi" kaa vikaas kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa ke adhyayan main yogadan diya
 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today
 ijac newton kaa janm 4 janvari 1643 ko puraani style or nai style kii tithiyaan |OS]]: 25 disambar 1642]linkolanshir ke county main ek hemelet, woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth main woolsthrope menor main hua
 At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted a Grigorian calendar and so the date of his birth was recorded as Christmas Day 25 December 1642
 newton kaa janm unke pita kii mrityu ke teen maah baad hua, ve ek samrudh kisaan the unka naam bhi ijac newton tha
 He was a small child born in a pre-mature state; His mother Hannah Ayscuff said that he could fit a small mug like a quart
 jab newton teen varsh ke the, unki maa ne dubaara shaadi kar lee or apane nae pati reverand barnabus smith ke saath rahane chali gai or apane putr ko uski nani margeri askf kii dekhbhaal main chod diya
chota ijac apane sautele pita ko pasand nahin karata tha or uske saath shaadi karne ke kaaran apni maa ke saath dushmani kaa bhav rakhata tha
 As reflected in the list of crimes committed by him until he was 19 years old: "I threatened to burn the house of mother and father Smith
" baarah varsh se satraa varsh kii aayu tak unhone di kings skool, grantham main shiksha praapt kii unhen skool se nikaal diya gaya or oktober 1659 ve woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth aa gaye, jahaan unki maan, jo duusari baar vidhwaa ho chuki thi, ne unhen kisaan banane par jor diya
 He hated farming
 kings skool ke master henry stokes ne unki maa se kaha ki ve unhen phir se skool bhej den taaki ve apni shiksha ko puraa kar saken
 Inspired by his desire for revenge against a schoolboy, he became a top-ranked student
 june 1661 main, unhen trinity college, cambridge main ek sijar-ek prakaar kii kaary-adhyayan bhoomika, ke rup main bhartee kiya gaya
 The teachings of the college at that time were based on Aristotle
 lekin newton adhik aadhunik darshanikon jaise descartes or khagolavidon jaise kopernicus, galileo or kepler ke vichaaron ko padhnaa chahta tha
 In 1665 he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory later known as the Altaipal calculus
 agast 1665 main jaise hi newton ne apni degree praapt kii, uske thik baad plig kii bheeshan mahamari se bachane ke liye ehtiyaat ke rup main vishvavidhyalay ko band kar diya

 In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of Trinity
 adhikansh aadhunik itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki newton or libanij ne atyalp kalan kaa vikaas apane apane adwitiya sanketanon kaa upyog karte hue swatantra rup se kiya
 According to Newton's inner circle, Newton developed his method many years before Leibniz, but he did not publish any of his works until about 1693 and did not give a complete account of his work until 1704
 Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684
 In addition, Leibniz's notations and "methods of differentiation" were universally adopted on the continent and, after 1820, were also adopted in the British Empire
 jabaki libanij kii pustikaayen praarambhik avasthaaon se paripakvata tak vichaaron ke aadhunikeekaran ko darshaati hai, newton ke gyaat nots main keval antim parinaam hi he
 Newton said that he did not want to publish his calculus because he was afraid he would become a character of ridicule
 newton kaa swiss ganitagya nicholas fatiyo de duiliar ke saath bahut kareebi rishta tha, jo prarambh se hi newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant se bahut prabhavit the
 In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never completed it
 However, the relationship between these two men changed in 1693
 is samay, duiliar ne bhi libanij ke saath kai patron kaa aadan pradaan kiya tha
 In early 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the controversy was fully revealed in 1711
 newton kii royal socity ne ek adhyayan dwaara ghoshnaa kii ki newton hi sachche avishkaarak the or libanij ne dhokhadhadi kii thi
 The study came under suspicion when it was later found that Newton himself wrote commentary on the study's conclusion on Leibniz
 is prakaar kadava newton banaam libanij vivaad shuru ho gaya, jo baad main newton or libanij donon ke jivan main 1716 main libanij kii mrityu tak jari rahaa
 Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, which is valid for any power
 unhone newton kii sarvasamikaon, newton kii vidhi, vargeekrut ghan samtal vakr kii khoj kii, parimit antaron ke siddhant main mahatvapurn yogadan diya, ve pehle vyakti the jinhone bhinnaatmak suchakank kaa prayog kiya or diophentin samikarnon ke hal ko vyutpann karne ke liye nirdeshaank jyamiti kaa upyog kiya
 He approximated the partial sum of the harmonic series by logarithms, and was the first to use the power series with confidence and the power of the power series
 unhen 1669 main ganit kaa leukesian professor chunaa gaya
 In those days, any member of Cambridge or Oxford was required to be a designated English priest
 haalaanki, leukesian professor ke liye jaruri tha ki vah carch main sakriy na ho
 Newton argued that he should be exempt from the need for coordination, and Charles II, whose permission was mandatory, accepted this argument
 is prakaar se newton ke dharmik vichaaron or angreji rudhiwaadiyon ke bich sangharsh tal gaya
 From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics
 During this period he discovered refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism dissects white light into a spectrum of colors, and a lens and a second prism combine white spectrum to form white light
 unhone yah bhi dikhaaya ki rangeen prakaash ko alag karne or bhinn vastuon par chamakaane se ragin prakaash ke gunon main koi parivartan nahin aata he
 Newton described that whether it is reflected, or radiated or transmitted, it remains of the same color
 is prakaar se, unhone dekha ki, rang pehle se rangeen prakaash ke saath vastu kii antarkriya kaa parinaam hota he naaki vasteen khud rangon ko utpann karti hai
 This is known as Newton's color theory
 is kaary se unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki, kisi bhi apvarti doordarshee kaa lens prakaash ke rangon main visaran kaa anubhav karegaa or is avadharana ko siddh karne ke liye unhone abhidrishyak ke rup main ek darpan kaa upyog karte hue, ek doordarshee kaa nirmaan kiya, taaki is samasya ko hal kiya ja sake
 darasal dizin ke nirmaan ke anusaar, pehla gyaat kriyaatmak paravarti doordarshee, aaj ek neutonian doorabeen ke rup main janaa jaataa he, isamen takanic ko aakaar dena tathaa ek upyukt darpan padaarth kii samasya ko hal karnaa shaamil he
 Newton based his mirror on a custom outfit of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to test the quality of optics for his telescope
 farvari 1669 tak ve rangeen vipathan ke bina ek upkaran kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 In 1671 the Royal Society asked him to demonstrate his reflecting telescope
 un logon kii ruchi ne unhen apni tippaniyon on color ke prakaashan hetu protsaahit kiya, jise baad main unhone apni optics ke rup main vistrut kar diya
 When Robert Hooke criticized some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he dropped out of public debate
 hook kii mrityu tak donon dushman bane rahe
 Newton argued that light is made up of particles or superfluous particles, which refract as they pass through the dense medium, but it was necessary to correlate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light
 
 baad main bhautikavidon ne prakaash ke vivartan ke liye shuddh tarang jaise spashtikaran kaa samarthan kiya
 Today's quantum mechanics, the idea of photons and wave-particle coupling, bear little resemblance to Newton's understanding of light
 1675 kii unki prakaash kii pariklpana main newton ne kanon ke bich bal ke sthaanantaran hetu, ether kii upasthiti ko manjuur kiya
 His interest in alchemy revived after coming into contact with the theologian Henry More
 unhone ether ko kanon ke bich aakarshan or pratikarshan ke vayuruddh vichaaron par aadhaarit gupt balon se pratisthapit kar diya
 jon menard kenez, jinhone rasayan vidya par newton ke kai lekhon ko sweekaar kiya, kehete hai ki "newton kaaran ke yug ke pehle vyakti nahin the: ve jaaduugaron main aakhri number par the
 "newton's interest in alchemy cannot be distinguished from his contributions to science
 yadi unhone ek nirvaat main se hokar ek duuri par kriya ke gupt vichaar par bharosa nahin kiya hota to ve gurutv kaa apana siddhant viksit nahin kar pate
 In 1704 Newton published Optics, in which he explained in detail his theory of microscopic particles of light
 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe
 1677 main, newton ne phir se yantriki par apana kaary shuru kiya, arthath, gurutvkarshan or grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon ke sandarbh ke saath, grahon kii kaksha par gurutvkarshan kaa prabhaav or is vishay par hook or flemustid kaa paraamarsh
 He published his results at the De Motu Corporum in Jiram
 isamen gati ke niyamon kii shuruyaat thi jisane princepia ko suchit kiya
 The Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published on 5 July 1687 with the financial help and encouragement of Edmund Healy
 is kaary main newton ne gati ke teen saarvbhaumik niyam die jinamein 200 se bhi adhik varshon tak koi sudhaar nahin kiya gaya he
 He used the Latin word gravitas to that effect known as gravitation and defined the law of universal gravitation
 isi kaary main unhone vaayu main dhwani kii gati ke, boil ke niyam par aadhaarit pehle vishleshatmak pramaan ko prastut kiya
 He was criticized for Newton's concept of an invisible force that could operate over vast distances, as he merged "secret agencies" into science
 princepia ke saath, newton ko antarrashtriya khyaati mili
 unhen kaaphi prashansaaen milin, unke ek prashansak the, switzraland main janme nicholas fatiyo de dayulir, jinke saath unka ek gaharaa rishta ban gaya, jo 1693 main tab samaapt hua jab newton tantrika avrodh se peedit ho gaye
 In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious researches related to literary interpretation of the Bible
 henry mor ke brahmad main vishwaas or kartiya dwaitvaad ke liye asweekruti ne shaayad newton ke dharmik vichaaron ko prabhavit kiya
 He sent a manuscript to John Locke in which he disputed the existence of the Trinity, which was never published
 baad ke kaary – di kronology of encyent kingdems amended or obsarvations apon di prophysij of danniel and di apocalips of saint jon – kaa prakaashan unki mrityu ke baad hua
 He also devoted much of his time to alchemy

 In 1696 Newton moved to London to assume the post of warden of the royal mint, a position he gained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, the first Earl of Halifax, the then Chancellor of the Treasury
 unhone england kaa pramukh mudra dhallaai kaa kaary sambhaal liya, kisi tarah master lucas ke ishaaron par naachne lage Lucan's death in 1699 became Newton perhaps the best-known master of the mint, a position Newton held until his death
 These appointments were taken as an irresponsible position, but Newton took him seriously, from his Cambridge duties in 1701 Retired and tried to improve the currency and punished the clippings and fake currency makers using their power
 1717 main taksaal ke master ke rup main "laa of queen ene" main newton ne anjaane main sone ke paksh main chaandi ke paise or sone ke sikke ke bich dwi dhatvik sambandh sthapit karte hue, pound sterling ko chaandi ke maanak se sone ke maanak main badal diya
 For this reason silver sterling coins were melted and shipped out of Britain
 newton ko 1703 main royal socity kaa adhyaksh or french acadmic des sciensej kaa ek sahyogi bana diya gaya
 While in his position in the Royal Society, Newton turned hostile to the astronomer John Flemsteed, he prematurely published Flemsteed's Historica Colestis Britannica, which Newton had used in his studies
 april 1705 main queen eni ne newton ko trinity college, cambridge main ek shahi yatra ke dauraan nite kii oopaadhi di
 This knight's title was not conferred upon Newton for his services as master of the mint nor for his scientific work, but for his political contributions during the parliamentary election in May 1705

 His half-niece, Catherine Barton Conduite, served as her hostess in social affairs at her house in Germain Street in London; He was her "very loving Uncle", which is mentioned in her letter written to her by Newton when she was recovering from smallpox
 newton, jinke koi bachche nahin the, unke antim varshon main unke rishtdaaron ne unki adhikansh sampatti par adhikaar kar liya or nirvasiyat hi unki mrityu ho gai
 After his death, a large amount of mercury was found in Newton's body, probably a result of his chemical business
 paare kii vishaaktata newton ke antim jivan main sanakeepan ko spasht kar sakati he
 French mathematician Joseph Lewis lagrange often said that Newton was the greatest genius and once said that he was "the most fortunate also because we cannot establish the world's system more than once
" Impressed by Newton's achievements, the English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous memoir: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "let Newton be" and all was light
 newton apni uplabdhiyon kaa bataane main khud sankoch karte the, farvari 1676 main unhone robert hook ko ek patr main likhaa: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants haalanki aamtaur par itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki uparokt panktiyaan, namrata ke saath kahe gaye ek kathan ke alaava – yaa bajaay –, hook par ek hamalaa thim 
 us samay prakaashikeey khojon ko lekar donon ke bich ek vivaad chal rahaa tha
 The latter interpretation is also appropriate with many other controversies over his discoveries, such as the question of who discovered the calculus, as noted above
 baad main ek itihaas main, newton ne likhaa: i do not know how i will appear to the world, but for myself i am a boy who is playing on the edge of the sea and concentrating now and then, a more smooth stone or a more beautiful Trying to find the shell, this great sea of truth has not been discovered before me

 he never made a public declaration of his personal faith — making this orthodoxy extremely radical
 unhone apane vishwaas ko itani acchhee tarah se chupaaya ki aaj bhi vidwaan unki nijee manyataon ko jaan nahin paayen hai
 "snowbelen concluded that Newton had at least one Socinian sympathizer, possibly an anti-trinity, almost certainly the Arrian
 —teen purvji rup jo aaj uniterianvaad kehalaate hai
 In an era noted for his religious intolerance, there are few public expressions of Newton's radical views, most notably, his refusal to obey holy orders, and to take the sacrament when he was about to die
 And he refused

 Newton wrote on literal criticism, most notably
 en historical acount of tu noteble karpshan of scripchar He also placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ on 3 April AD 33, which agrees with a traditionally accepted date
 unhone bible ke andar chupe hue sandeshon ko khojane kaa asafal prayaas kiya
 In his own lifetime, Newton wrote about religion more than the natural sciences
 He believed in a rational world, but rejected the Hylozoism inherent in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza 
 Thus, ordered and dynamically informed The universe was understandable and must be understood by an active cause
 In his correspondence, Newton claimed that Prine While writing in Zippia, "I kept an eye on such principles, so that a man can be considered while believing in God
" He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system should be allowed the effect of choice
 " But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be necessary to improve the system due to the slow growth of instabilities

 The attacks against pre-enlightenment "magical thinking," and the mystical elements of Christianity, found their foundation in Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe
 Newton perfected Boyle's ideas through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, he was very successful in popularizing them
 Newton transformed an interventionist God-controlled world into a world artistically created by God with rational and universal principles

 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation

 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth
 " isi prakaar ke shabdon main, volter mahakavy kavita par niabandh main likhaa, "sar ijac newton kaa apane baganon main gum rahe the, ped se girte hue ek seb ko dekh kar, unhone gurutvkarshan kii pranali ke bare main pehali baar sochaa
 The various trees are claimed to be "that" apple tree which Newton has described
 di kings skool, grantham daawa karata he ki yah ped skool ke dwaara kharid liya gaya tha, kuch saalon baad ise jad sahit laakar pradhanadhyaapak ke bageeche main laga diya gaya
 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked
