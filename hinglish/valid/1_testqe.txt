 In 1652 AD, at the age of six, Leibniz was sent to study at the Nikolai School in Leipzig
 parantu durbhagyavash usee varsh uske pita kii mrityu ho gayi
 Due to this, there was a lot of disruption in his studies
 vah kabhi skool jaataa tha to kabhi nahin ja paata tha
 Now he often started learning by self-study
 apane pita se usne itihaas sambandhi kaaphi jaankaree praapt kii thi
 Due to this, his interest was greatly increased in the study of history
 iske alaava vibhinn bhashaaon ko seekhney main uski kaaphi abhiruchi thi
 At the age of eight, he learned Latin
 baarah varsh kii avasthaa main usne greek bhashaa sikh lee
 He also started writing poems in Latin
 15 varsh kii avasthaa main libnij ne lipjig vishvavidhyalay main kanoon ke ek vidhyaarthee ke rup main pravesh paaya
 In this university, he spent the first two years in the deep study of philosophy under the direction of Jacob Yomasius

 These great thinkers included Francis Bacon, Kepler, Campanella and Galileo etc

 For this purpose he contacted Irhard Weigel, a resident of Jena

 After studying mathematics under Weigel for some time, he studied law for the next three years
 uske baad usne doctor of lau kii degree hetu aavedan patr jamaa kiya
 However, Leipzig University did not allow him due to his age
 at usne lipjig vishvavidhyalay chhod diya tathaa alt dorf vishvavidhyalay main doctor of lau kii degree hetu aavedan jamaa kiya
 Here his application was accepted and in November 1666 AD he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Law
 haalaanki libnij mulat kanoon kaa vidhyaarthee rah chukaa tha parantu uski abhiruchi vigyaan ke vibhinn vishyon main kaaphi adhik thi
 In 1669 AD, he wrote a letter to Jacob Thomas, in which he stated that the principles of physics propounded by Aristotle make the arrangement of natural activities satisfactory

 In 1671, Leibniz published a paper titled 'hypothesis Physica Nauva' in which he expressed the idea that ether has an important role in all astronomical activities
 san 1671 main hi vah apane shodhon ke silsile main paris jaakar antoina arnould, nicholas mailebranke tathaa chrishchiyan hoijan jaise pramukh vaigyanikon se mila
 He published several research papers related to subjects such as mathematics, mechanics, optics, hydrostatics, pneumatics and nautical science
 in shodhon main sabase pramukh tha `'calculating mashin' kaa avishkaar
 Many types of calculations could be done with this device
 is mashin ko libnij ne paris main `academy des sciensej' tathaa landan kii `'royal sosayadi' ke samaksh prastut kiya
 As a result, Leibniz was nominated as a member of the Royal Society in 1673
 isi prakaar san 1700 main use `academy press sciensej' kaa videshi sadsy bhi niyukt kiya gaya
 Leibniz himself was fully devoted to scientific research, he also inspired other people for this
 isi uddeshy ko dhyaan main rakh kar usne 11 july 1700 i
 ko 'berlin academy' kii sthapana kii
 He was elected the first president of this academy
 is academy kaa kaaryaklap tathaa iske sadasyon kii sankhya din dooni-raat chauguni badhati gayi
 The research done by Leibniz in the field of mathematics has been very important
 usne calculas ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Although calculus was started long ago by Greek mathematicians for calculating the area of circles and the volume of cylinders, cones and spheres, that calculus was of initial level
 libnij dwaara calculas ke vikaas kii disha main jo shodh kiye gayi ve mile ke pathar sabit hue
 The signals he introduced in differential and integral are still being used till date
 sirf vigyaan ke kshetra main hi nahin, apitu aadhyatm tathaa darshan ke kshetra main bhi libnij kaa yogadan kaaphi mahatvapurn tha
 In this direction, most of his works were done between 1685 and 1716 AD
 usne darshan sambandhi apane siddhanton ke lekhan kaa kaary san 1686 i
 main hi puraa kar liya tha jab usne 'discorse metaphysic' naamak pandulipi kaa lekhan kaary puraa kiya
 But unfortunately this manuscript written by him was published in 1846, about 130 years after his death
 uske jivan kaal main uski sirf ek hi kriti prakashit ho paayi thi jiskaa naam tha 'esses di theodissi surala bonte di diula liberty di el himme'
 This book was published in two volumes in 1710 AD
 haalanki libnij dwaara likhit pustaken adhik prakashit nahin huin, parantu uske dwaara likhe gayi shodh patr samay-samay par kai pramukh patrikaon main prakashit hote rahe
 Among the journals in which his shadow papers were often published, the main ones were 'acta Iruditorum' published from Leipzig and 'journal de Savantes' published from Paris
 in pramukh patrikaon main prakashit uske shodh patron ne use vaigyanik jagat main kaaphi acchhee khyaati dilaayi
 The papers that Leibniz wrote to his contemporary philosophers and scientists were also of research standard
 udaahranarth usne samuel clark ko jo patr likhe the unamem ishwar, aatma, kaal evam sthaan ityadi ke sambandh main pratipaadit uske siddhanton kii vistrut charchaa kii gayi thi
 The thoughts expressed by him in these letters all seem to be related to high-level philosophy
 libnij kii adhikansh kritiyaan uske nidhan ke baad hi prakashit kii ja sakin
 For example, in 1765, a book called 'bauvioux es sur l'intentment Hummen' was published from Leipzig
 san 1718 main 'principes dila nechar at dela gres fonds in ricen' naamak granth prakashit kiya gaya
 The last part of Leibniz's life was spent in a very pathetic and tragic situation
 san 1692 se 1716 i
 tak vah praayah rogagrast hi rahaa
 In the last period, there was no one to take care of him or care

 Although the Andhra Mahabharata is largely a translation, Nannayya wrote some excerpts from the point of view of rasa and appropriateness, and some excerpts from which the Andhra Mahabharata seems to be an independent poem

 is kaaran nannayy andhra ke adikavi hi nahin, andhra ke pratham vaiyaakaran bhi siddh hue or 'vaganushasan' viruddh se vibhooshit hue
 All the Andhra poets till date have praised Nannayya as Adikavi

 The hindi-urdu dispute is a linguistic dispute that started in the 19th century in the Indian subcontinent
 is vivaad ke kuch mul prashn ye the- uttari bharat tathaa uttari-pashchimi bharat kii bhashaa kaa swaroop kya ho, sarkari kaaryon main kis bhashaa / lipi kaa prayog ho, hindi or urdu ek hi bhashaa ke do rup style hai yaa alag-alag hai hindi or urdu hindi bhashaa kii khadi boli kii rup ko kaha jaataa he or yah lagbhag bharat kii 45% jansankhya kii bhashaa he jise vibhinn hindi, hindustani or urdu ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In fact, the hindi-urdu dispute started in the English period and the British rule directly or indirectly helped to increase this dispute
 isi kram main britani shashan samaapt hone ke baad urdu pakistan kii rajbhasha ghoshit kii gayi or hindi bharat kii rajbhasha 
 At present, according to some Muslims, Hindus abandoned Urdu while some Hindus believe that Urdu was artificially produced during Muslim rule
 hindi or urdu hindi kii khadi boli ke do bhinn saahitiyik rup hai
 a Persianized form of Khadi dialect, variously called Hindi, Hindustani and Urdu, took shape during the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Sultanate of South Asia
 east india company ne aadhunik bharat ke hindi bolne vaale uttari praanton main farsi bhashaa kii jagah urdu lipi main likhit urdu ko sarkari maanak bhashaa kaa dariija de diya, angrezi ke saath
 In the last few decades of the nineteenth century, the hindi-urdu dispute erupted in the North Western Provinces and Awadh
 hindi or urdu ke samarthak kramshah devanagari or farsi lipi main likhit hindustani kaa paksh lene lage the
 Hindi movements that supported the development and official status of Devanagari were established in North Hind
 babu shiv prasad or madanamohan malviya is andolan ke aarambh ke ullekhneey samarthak the
 This resulted in the creation of Urdu movements that supported the official status of Urdu; Syed Ahmed Khan was one of his famous supporters
 san 1900 main, sarkaar ne hindi or urdu donon ko samaan pratikatmak darja pradaan kiya jiskaa muslimon ne virodh kiya or hindooon ne khushi vyakt kii
 The linguistic dispute between Hindi and Urdu increased as Sanskrit took the root of formal and academic vocabulary similar to Persian-derived words in Hindi
 isse hindu-muslim matbhed badhane lage or mahatma gandhi ne maanakon kaa punah shuddhikaran karke parmparik shabd hindustani ke andar urdu athwa devanagari lipi kaam main lene kaa suzav diya
 This was supported by members of Congress and some leaders involved in India's independence movement
 iske falswaroop 1950 main bhartiya samvidhan ke liye bani sanstha ne angrezi ke saath urdu ke sthaan par hindi ko devanagari lipi main rajbhasha ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 The main reason for differences between the two communities may be the aspirations to spread their cultural ideas which emerged as an open dispute during the independence of India
 muslim apni saanskrithik prerana strot muslim ummaa ko maanate hai jabaki hindu saamanytah vaidic or puranic samskruti ko apana prerana strot maanate hai
 People who accepted the religion of Islam during Muslim rule adopted that culture
 farsi bhashaa ko us samay madhya asia jaise islamic kshetron main sabase mahatvapurn or pratishthit bhashaa maani jaati thi
 The founders of the rule of Islam in India were of different ethnicities such as Turq, Mongol, Arabic, Iranian, Afghan etc
 and they all used Persian as their common language and court language
 hinduon ne ise videshi samskruti ke rup main dekha
 Over time, subjects like Sanskrit language, Dhoti and Ayurveda were seen to be associated with Hinduism and Persian language, Unani system of medicine was seen to be associated with Muslims
 isse dono samudaayon ke vyanjanon or samskruti main or adhik antar aane lag gaya
 Urdu became a court language in the Muslim-ruled parts of the Indian subcontinent from the eighteenth century and beyond
 yah arabi, farsi or turkiyai bhashaa ke prabhaav vaali tathaa dilli evam iske aas-paas ke kshetron main boli jane vaali khadiboli se viksit hui
 As Muslim rule increased in northern India, Urdu became associated with the native languages of other places and some Persian words were established in place of the original words there
 isi tarah samay ke saath-saath yah ek nayi bhashaa ke rup main viksit ho gayi
 Hindi also developed from Khadiboli, though most of the words came from domestic dialect and Sanskrit
 vibhinn karkon ke prabhaav se hindi or urdu main dooriyaan badhaayi
 Muslim rulers chose to write Urdu in Urdu script instead of Devanagari script
 isi samay main mukhyatah 18veen or 19veen sadi main urdu bhashaa ne apana vikaas likhit urdu sahitya ke rup main kiya
 This led to the division of Hindus who used to write Hindustani in Devanagari and others who started writing Hindustani in Urdu script
 unnisvin sadi ke uttararddh main hindi vikaas ke aandolanon ne vivaad ko or badha diya
 Prof
 Paul R
 Brass, in his book Language, Religion and Politics in North India, has written- san 1837 main, britani east india company ne vibhinn praanton main farsi bhashaa ke sthaan vahaan kii gharelu bhashaa se aadhikarik or nyaayalayan bhashaa ke rup main manyata pradaani kii
 However, to replace the Persian language in the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent, instead of keeping Hindi in Devanagari, Urdu was introduced in Urdu script as the official language and justice language

 According to court memorandums in 1868, he accused the Muslim rulers of India for forcing them to teach Persian

 In the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, various Hindi movements took place, in which the Nagri Pracharini Sabha in Benares in 1893, the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan in Allahabad in 1910, the South India Prachar Sabha in 1918 and the Rashtriya Bhasha Prachar Samiti in 1926
 in andolanon ko 1881 main protsaahit kiya gaya jab bihar ke najadik ke kshetron main rajbhasha ke rup main devanagari lipi main hindi ke sthaan par farsi lipi main urdu ko manyata pradaan kii gayi

 He also argued that the Urdu script would encourage documents to be ambiguous, encouragement of forgery and use of complex Arabic and Persian words
 anjuman taraqqi-e-urdu jaise sanghathanon kaa urdu kii vakaalat karne ke liye nirmaan hua
 Urdu advocates argued that Hindi script cannot be written fast and there is also a problem of standardization and lack of vocabulary
 unka yah bhi tark tha ki urdu bhashaa kaa udbhav bharat main hi hua he jise adhikttar log dharapravaah ke saath bol sakate hai or yah takaraar bhi shaamil kiy ki iske shiksha ke kshetra main vistaar ke liye ise rajbhasha kaa darja dena aavashyak he
 Communal violence started to flare up and it became violent
 saiyad ahamed khan ne ek baar kaha, "main hinduon or muslimon ko ek hin aankh se dekhtaa hoon & unhen ek dulhan kii do aankhon kii tarah dekhtaa hoon

 " unnisvin sadi ke antim teen dashakon main uttar pashchimi praanton tathaa avadh main kai baar vivaad bhadkaa
 The Government of India established the Hunter Commission to review the progress of education, which was used for advocating Hindi and Urdu and for their own reasons
 hindi or urdu donon main bhashaayi or saanskrithik dooriyaan bad rahi thi
 On linguistic basis, words from Sanskrit in Hindi and Persian, Arabic and Turkish in Urdu were underlined
 saanskrithik rup se urdu muslimon kii tathaa hindi ko hinduon se jodakar dekha jane laga
 In the 1920s, Gandhiji expressed sorrow over this expansion gap and called for Hindustani to be written in both Nagari and Persian scripts by merging the two languages again
 yadhyapi wo hindustani binar tale hindi or urdu ko laane ke apane prayaas main asafal rahe lekin ise gaiyr-hindi kshetron main lokapriy kar diya

 In April 1900, the colonial government of the north-western Province issued an order granting equal status to both the Nagari and persian-arabic scripts
 is aadesh kaa urdu samarthakon ne kaaphi virodh kiya or hindi samarthakon ne samarthan kiya
 However, even more symbolic in the order was that it did not make any special provision for the use of the Nagari script

 rajasthan ke chaaran kaviyon ne apane geeton ke liye jis saahitiyik style kaa prayog kiya he, use dingal yaa dingal kaha jaataa he
 Apart from the Charan poets, other poets like Prithiraj have also composed in Dingle style
 rajasthan ke bhatta kavi "dingal" kaa aashray na lekar "pingal" main rachana karte rahe hai
 Some scholars consider "dingle" and "rajasthani" to be synonymous with each other, but this view is philosophically flawed
 is tarah dalpati vijay, narpathi naalh, bardaai or nallasinh bhaat kii rachanaaon ko bhi "dingal" sahitya main maan lenaa avaigyaniktaa he
 Of these, Nalha's composition "katha" is from Rajasthani, not embedded in the artificial dingle style and the remaining three are definitely in the Pingal style
 vastut: "dingal" ke sarvapratham kavi dhaadhi kavi baadar hai
 Substantial compositions are available in this artificial literary genre, most of which are retail couplets and royalistic songs
 "dingal" ke pramukh kaviyon main baadar, prithiraj, isardas, durasa ji aadhaa, karanidan kaviya, manchaaram sevak, bankidas asia, kishan ji aadhaa, mishran kavi suryamall or maharaja chatursingh ji hai
 The compositions of the last poet are in the Kashmiri Mewari dialect rather than in the artificial dingle style
 saahitiyik bhashastyli ke liye "dingal" shabd kaa sarvapratham prayog bankidas ne kukavi batisi main kiya he : 'dingliyaan miliyaan karai, pingal tano prakaas'
 There are many opinions about the etymology and meaning of this word
 1
 "dingal" shabd kaa arth aniyamit athwa ganvaa degree he
 This style is called "dingle" because of not following the rules of literature and grammar
 2
 pehle marudesh kii bhashaa ko "dagal" kaha jaataa tha, baad main "pingal" ke vajan par ise "dingal" kaha jane laga 
 3
 It is called "dingle" because it is 'D' alphabet
 4
 dam degree kii dhwani ke saadrishy par ojoguaprachur virarasaatmak padyon kii is bhashastyli ko "dingal" kaha jaataa he 
 5
 Menaria disagrees with all these views
 unke matanusaar "dingal" shabd, jo iskaa vaastavik rup he, dinge shabd ke saath swaarthe pratyay "l" ke yoga se bana he
 Its real meaning is boastful on the one hand and rough or disorganized on the other
 dingal kii dhvanisanghatana tathaa vyakaran marwari yaa pashchimi rajasthani ke hi anuroop he, kintu iskaa shabdkosh anek aise tadbhav, ardhatatsam tathaa deshaj shabdon se bharaa padaa he, jo usee rup main vyavahrut nahin paae jate
 Muraridan, the son of the mixing poet Suryamalla, has composed a dinghalakosh giving the meanings of the words used in the dingle
 dingal geeton kaa vaachan or gayan bahut saral nahin he
 In this, the Vikatbandh song is considered even more difficult
 doctor kaviya ek vikatbandh geet kii misaal dete hai jisamen pehali pankti main 54 matraayen thim, phir 14-14 matraaon kii 4-4 panktiyaan ek jaisaa varna or anuprash! ise ek swar or saans main bolnaa padataa tha or kavi geetkaar iske liye abhyaas karte the
 Singles, which were the language of devotion, valor and adornment in Rajasthan, are now becoming out of fashion
 ab haalat ye he ki dingal bhashaa main prachur maatra main uplabdh pracheen granthon ko padhane kii yogyata rakhane vaale bahut kam log rah gaye hai
 Sometimes the enchanting songs of Deengal used to excite in Ranbankur on the battlefield, but the time has changed that the poetic stream of Deengal, which has been flowing for centuries in Rajasthan, Gujarat and some parts of Sindh province of Pakistan, is now disappearing
 prasiddh sahityakar doctor lakshmi kumari chudaavat chintaa ke swar main kahati hai ki yahi haal rahaa to dingal kaa vajood hi khatare main pad jayega
 Writer Poonamchand Bishnoi says that earlier the government used to get government support and it was related to employment but now it is not so

 koi bhi upkaran jiskaa prayog apane shatru ko chot pahunchaane, vash main karne yaa hatya karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, shastr yaa aayudh kehalaata he
 Weapons can be used to attack, defend or intimidate
 shastr ek taraf lathi jitna saral ho saktaa he to duusari taraf belistic prakshepastra jitna jatil bhi
 Armaments are those instruments used in warfare
 is prakaar tir, talwaar se lekar badi-badi topon tak sabhi yantra aayudh hai
 The history of the development of armaments is as old as the development of mankind
 maanav jivan adikaal se sangharmpurn rahaa he
 He would have had to fight terrible and powerful creatures to save life
 manushya ke paas na to un jeevajantuon ke baraabar bal tha, na utana motaa or kathor charm or na teevr tathaa ghaatak daant tathaa nakh hi the
 Man must have invented the first weapons with his experiences and intelligence
 ende yaa lathi kaa vikaas barchaa, gada, talwaar, ballab or aadhunik sangeen main hua
 Similarly, simple stone throwing was developed in spear, bow-arrow or archery, catapult, ball, bullet and modern nuclear bomb
 ayudhon ke vikaas or badhati shakti ke saath-saath pratiraksha ke upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa hui or unka avishkaar hua
 Probably the art of making shields by trapping leather in wooden poles will be very old
 kalantar main kavach or aadhunik yug main aakar kavachayaan kaa avishkaar hua
 It has been seen that whenever humans created the means of destruction, along with that, the means of defense also developed
 ayudhon kaa vargeekaran saadhaarant: unke prayog, vidhi ore visheshtaon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 According to them, the classification of weapons from stone age to the invention of gunpowder is as follows: shastr ve hathiyaar he jo phenke nahin jate
 The following weapons are under their subclassification: kaatanevaale shastr; jaise talwaar, parashu aadi; Barking weapons, such as barkha, trident, etc
; kund shastr, jaise gada
 Weapons are weapons that are thrown
 inke antargat ye astr hai : According to archaeologists, the knowledge of man increased with time and he thoughtfully started making stones and wooden weapons at will
 phir inhen shastron ko ghiskar sapaat, sudaul, teevr or chamkila bananaa aarambh kiya
 The main weapons of this period were stone axes, mace and knives
 sahasron varsh baad usne dhanush or bhaale kaa bhi nirmaan kiya
 Around 4,000 years BC By the time man had found the address of the metal
 taanbe or raange ko milakar usne kaansa bananaa janaa ore tab dhire-dhire pathar ke shastron kaa sthaan kaanse ke shastron ne le liya
 Weapons of this period, especially of the bow, arrow, spear, knife, spear, ax and mace, and only the shield of bronze are found in defensive tools
 kaanse kaa sthaan praaia: 1000 i
pus
 main lohe ne liya
 In the Vedic period the classification of astrasastras was as follows: amukta - ve shastr jo phenke nahin jate the
 Mukta - The weapons that were thrown
 inke bhi do prakaar the- muktam-mukt - The weapon used both by throwing or throwing
 muktsannivritti - ve shastr jo phenkakar lautaae ja sakate the
 Firearms are also mentioned, but not more clearly
 shastron kaa vargeekaran kai tarah se kar sakate hai
 Some scholars have given the following 3 characteristics of weapons - prasiddh sainya vichaarak je epa si fuller ne hathiyaaron main nimnlikhit visheshtaon kaa hona anivaary bataaya he- In addition to the above qualities, it is also necessary to have the following qualities in the best weapons - sharir ke vibhinn angon kii raksha kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 For example, leather and armor for the body, head for head and neck for neck etc
 europe main bhi isi prakaar ke shastr banate the
 The 12th-century armor was made by kneading small pieces of iron
 jirahabakhtar sundar or suvidhajanak avashya tha, par baari shastron kii chot se purnataya raksha nahin kar saktaa tha
 Hence from the 13th century AD, iron sheet coverings were made in Europe and they were worn over the mesh
 yoddha ab sir se paanv tak pattakvach se dhakaa rahata tha
 The joints in these armors were maintained for easy movement of body components
 peeche ashv ke liye bhi liye bhi aisa hi kavach banane laga
 The trap was also made for both horse and man
 savaar or ashv ke kavach kaa bhaar 200 se 300 pound tak hota tha
 The power of weapons also increased in the 13th century
 angrejon kaa lanbaa dhanush itnaa shaktishaalee hota tha ki usase chalaaya baan saadhaaran kavchon ko bhed detaa tha
 This bow was six feet long and its six foot arrow could shoot up to 250 yards easily
 isi prakaar switzaraland kaa 'hellbird kulhada' tha
 Its shaft was eight feet and along with the ax, it also had a serpentine fork to pull the spear and rider into it
 daksh ladaaka isaki chot se achche kavach ko bhi kaat saktaa tha
 The invention of gunpowder gave such power in the hands of man that changed the design of war
 yah nishchit he ki 14veen shatabdi ke aarambh main aagneyastra ban chuke the
 The first firearms were cannons
 yah mukhyat: do prakaar kii banaai gai - ek choti nalwali or duusari lambii naliwali 
 These cannons were first made of copper and bronze and then made of iron
 15veen shatabdi main topein 30 inch paridhi kii hoti thim or 1,200 se 1,500 pound bhaar ke pathar ke gole chalaati thim
 Modern howitzers and heavy fieldguns are developed forms of mortar and bombard
 isi shatabdi ke ant tak choti haath kii topein baniin
 They were replaced by hand guns in the early 15th century
 isi kaa vikaas dhire-dhire musket, machalock, flintlock or aadhunik rifl main hua
 The efforts of making rapid-firing guns and the use of this connection started from the 16th century and this led to the first successful machine gun in 1884
 aaj kii mashinagan ek minute main kai sau goliyaan tak chalaa sakati he
 Other important weapons were also invented in the 14th to 16th centuries, such as hand bombs, bronze explosive shells, pistols, dahk shells, etc
 shastron kaa adhik vikaas aadhunik kaal main hua
 By the 16th century, firearms had become so influential that man's defensive armor was in vain
 san 1915 kaa manushya aagneyastra ke saamne asahaay rahaa, parantu isi varsh pratham kavachayaan kaa nirmaan hua
 Man could now escape from the attack of light firearms by sitting in this car made of thick sheets of steel
 bandook, rifl or topon ke kaarykaran kaa siddhant ek hi he
 The gunpowder is kept in a strongly closed vessel on three sides and after that the vessel is temporarily sealed from the fourth side by placing a pellet, bullet or shot
 phir barood main kisi yukti se aag laga di jaati he
 The gunpowder is immediately burnt and converted into gases
 atyant kam sthaan main utpann hone ke kaaran ye gaisen bahut sampidit rahati hai
 Therefore, they press the pellets, pellets or shells very forcefully
 gola jab tak yantra ke naal main chalata rahata he tab tak usapar daab padati rahati he or uskaa veg badhata rahata he
 Thus a lot of velocity is produced in it
 naal ke kaaran uski disha bhi nirdhaarit ho jaati he; isliye naal ko ghuma firaakar gole ko icchaanusaar lakshya par maaraa ja saktaa he
 There is definite evidence of the use of cannon in Europe from 1313 AD
 bharat main babar ne panipat kii ladaai main topon kaa pehle-pehle prayog kiya
 The first cannons were made of bronze and were molded
 parantu aisi topein paryaapt pusht nahin hoti thim
 They used to burst by putting more ammo in them
 is dosha ko dur karne ke liye unke upar lohe ke challe tapt karke khub kasakar chadha die jate the
 When frost, such rings shrink and hold the inner cord very firmly, just as the wheel mounted on top of the bullock cart is pressed
 adhik pushtataa ke liye challe chadhaane ke pehle naal par lambaai ke anudish bhi lohe kii chaden ek duusari se sataakar rakh di jaati thim
 a famous cannon of the time is Mons Meg, which is now placed on the fortress of Edinburgh to adorn
 iske baad lagbhag 200 varshon tak top banane main koi vishesh unnati nahin hui
 In this era, the cluster of drains was smooth
 parantu lagbhag san 1520 main germany ke ek top banaanevaale ne sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanche bananaa aarambh kiya
 This cannon consisted of longitudinal "shells" instead of circular shells
 sanchhidr main sarpilaakaar khaanchon ke kaaran prakshipt pind veg se naachne lagata he
 Thus the dancing object deviates much less from resistance to air and consequently falls more truthfully at the target
 1855 i
 main lard armastrang ne pitwaan lohe kii top kaa nirmaan kiya, jisamen pehle kii topon kii tarah munh kii ore se barood aadi bhari jane ke badale peeche kii ore se dhakkan hataakar yah sab saamagree bhari jaati thi
 40 pounds of it were filled in it
 saadhaaran topon main prakshipt bade veg se nikalataa he or top kii naal ko bahut unchi disha main nahin laayaa ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, small cannon guns are light and there is not much velocity in the projectile coming out of them, but they have the quality that the projectile falls very high up and down and hence it can kill the enemy hiding behind the wall, hill etc
 inhen morter kehete hai
 a cannon of mid-size is called a howitzer
 jaise-jaise topon ke banane main unnati hui vaise-vaise mortaron or houvitzron ke banane main bhi unnati hui
 In almost all countries, there was an advance in the manufacture of guns in the same way, because there was equal competition
 jab koi ek desh aadhik baari, adhik shaktishaalee yaa adhik furti se gola daagnevaali top banaata to baat bahut dinon tak chhipi na rahati or pratidwandvi deshon kii cheshtaa hoti ki usase bhi acchhee top banaai jaay
 In 1898, the French made a cannon that was to guide the guns that were made after that
 usase nikle prakshipt kaa veg adhik tha; uskaa aropan saraahneey tha; daagne par purnataya sthir rahata tha, kyonki aropan main aise daine lage the jo bhoomi main dhansakar top ko kisi dish main hilne na dete the
 All cannons retreat when fired
 is dhakke ke veg ko ghataane ke liye dravon kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 Its projections were made of thin walls
 inamen se prayek kii tol lagbhag 12 pound thi or usamen lagbhag saadhe teen pound ucch visphoti barood rahati thi
 There was also a cap containing special chemicals in the projectile, which caused the projectile to explode upon reaching the target and the pieces used to injure the enemy far and wide
 yah diwaar ke peeche chhipe sainikon ko bhi maar sakati he
 In the First World War, the Germans built a cannon called 'big Bertha', from which they started shelling 75 miles from Paris
 is top main koi nayaa siddhant nahin tha
 The cannon was only sufficiently large and athletic
 parantu hawaii jahaajon tathaa anya naveen yantron ke avishkaar se aisi topein ab luptpraaya ho gai hai
 The fireballs follow the same principle on which the ammunition arrows left on Deepawali
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke antim varsh main agnibaan bahut kaaryakari siddh hue
 There were 30 fireballs three-three inches in diameter and each one was filled with explosives called chordite
 prayek ke sir kaa bhaar 29 pound tha
 Each fire could go from 3,900 to 8,000 yards when fired
 prayek bijli ke switch se daaga jaataa tha
 These switches could either be arranged in such a way that the fireballs keep dropping automatically for half a second or as many fireballs or total fireballs at the same time
 ucch visphotak ke is ekaek dhamaake se shatru kii sena ko baari kshati pahunchati thi or vah atyant bhaybheet ho jaaya karti thi
 At the end of the Second World War, Germany created fireplaces with no human operator and far reaching names, named V-S and V-2
 dekhne main ve-ek vayuyan ke samaan hota tha
 It contained 130 gallons of petrol and the machine used to weigh about one ton
 udate samay iskaa veg 350 mile prati ghanta ho jaataa tha or chalane main yah bhayanak dhwani utpann karata tha
