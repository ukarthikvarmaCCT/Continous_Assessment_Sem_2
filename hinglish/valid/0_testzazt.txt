 The editing art of the Granth Sahib is unique, reflecting the wisdom of Guru ji
 unhone raagon ke aadhaar par granth sahib main sankalit vaaniyon kaa jo vargeekaran kiya he, uski misaal madhyakaalin dharmik granthon main durlabh he
 It is a proof of his understanding that the writings of 36 great orators were compiled without any discrimination in the Granth Sahib

 akbar ke dehanth ke baad jahangir dilli kaa shaasha bana
 He was a fanatic
 apane dharm ke alaava, use or koi dharm pasand nahin tha
 Even religious and social work of Guru Ji did not find him pleasant
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa yah bhi mat he ki shahjada khusroko sharan dene ke kaaran jahangir guru ji se naaraaz tha
 May 15, 1606 AD On the emperor issued the order to hold Guru ji with the family
 tujke-jahangiri ke anusaar unka parivaar murtajakhan ke hawaale kar gharbaar lut liya gaya
 After this Guruji attained martyrdom

 To remember him on the martyrdom festival of Guru ji means to recognize the secular ideology that Guru ji supported by surrendering
 unhone sandesh diya tha ki mahaan jivan mulyon ke liye aatm-balidaan dene ko sadaiv taiyaar rahanaa chahie, tabhi kaum or raashtra apane gaurav ke saath jeevant rah sakate hai

 The method is often in the form of well-written detectors
 samaaj ko samyak dhang se chalaane ke liye vidhi atyant aavashyak he
 Laws are those general rules of human behavior which are accepted and enforced by the state, which are non-mandatory
 paalan na karne par nyaaypalika dand detaa he
 The legal system elaborates on a range of rights and responsibilities
 vidhi shabd apane aap main hi vidhaataa se judaa hua shabd lagata he
 In the spiritual world, 'law of law' refers to 'law made by the Creator'
 jivan evam mrityu vidhaataa ke dwaara banaaya hua kanoon he yaa vidhi kaa hi vidhaan kah sakate he
 In general, law of law, law of nature, law of the living world and law of society
 rajya dwaara nirmit vidhi se aaj puri duniya prabhavit ho rahi he
 Politics has become an essential part of society today
 samaaj kaa prayek jeev kanoonon dwaara sanchalit he
 Today in the name of the rule of law in the society also, governments around the world make laws for citizens
 vidhi kaa udeshy samaaj ke aacharan ko niyamit karnaa he
 Explanation is also made for the rights and responsibilities, as well as the purpose of the crime law is to create fear among the criminals by declaring the activities being done in the society against the unnatural work or public policy
 sanyukt raashtra sangh ne 1945 se lekar aaj tak apane charter ke madhyam se yaa apane vibhinn anusaangik sanghathano ke madhyam se duniya ke rajyo ko va nagarikon ko yah bataane kaa prayaas kiya ki bina shanti ke samaaj kaa vikaas sambhav nahin he parantu shanti ke liye sashastitv evam nyaaypurna drushtikon hi nahin aacharan ko jinda karnaa bhi jaruri he
 Peace, harmony, friendship, coexistence can be established in a just society
 kanoon yaa vidhi kaa matlab he manushya ke vyavhaar ko niyantrit or sanchalit karne vaale niyamon, hidaayaton, paabandiyon or hakon kii samhita
 But this role also has moral, religious and other social codes
 darasal, kanoon in samhitaon se kai myanon main alag he
 The first thing is that the law is made by the government but in society it is applied equally to all
 duusare, ‘rajya kii ichha’ kaa rup le kar vah anya sabhi saamaajik niyamon or maanakon par praathamikta praapt kar letaa he
 Thirdly, law is compulsory ie citizens do not have freedom to choose to obey it
 paalan na karne vaale ke liye kanoon main dand kii vyavastha hoti he
 But, the law does not just punish
 vah vyaktiyon yaa pakshon ke bich anubandh karne, vivaah, uttaradhikaar, laabhon ke vitaran or sansthaaon ko sanchalit karne ke niyam bhi muhaiyaa karaata he
 The law also plays the confirmed role of established social morals
 chauthe, kanoon kii prakruti ‘saarvajanik’ hoti he kyonki prakashit or manyata praapt niyamon kii samhita ke rup main uski rachana aupchaarik vidhaayi prakriyaaon ke zariye kii jaati he
 Finally, the law has a moral obligation to comply with which even those who find it unjust are compelled to obey the law
 raajnneetik vyavastha chaahe loktantric ho yaa adhinayakawadi, use kanoon kii kisi na kisi samhita ke aadhaar par chalanaa padataa he
 However, democratic systems have the right to repeal a law that has become irrelevant or not considered justified with changing times, and to demand a new better law in its place
 kanoon kii ek ullekhneey bhoomika samaaj ko sangathit style main chalaane ke liye nagarikon ko shikshit karne kii bhi maani jaati he
 In the beginning, the study of law was at the center of political science
 raajnneetik darshanik vidhi ke saar or sanrachana ke sawaal par jabardast bahason main uljhe rahe hai
 Law scholars also have to study anthropology, political economics, ethics and legislative value-systems
 samvidhansammat aadhaar par sanchalit hone vaale udaarataavaadi loktantron main ‘kanoon ke shashan’ kii dharna prachlit hoti he
 In these systems no one works outside the purview of law, neither the person nor the government
 iske peeche kanoon kaa udaarataavaadi siddhant he jiske anusaar kanoon kaa uddeshy vyakti par paabandiyaan lagaana na ho kar uski swatantraaa kii guarantee karnaa he
 Liberal theory holds that without law it would be impossible to restrain personal conduct and the rights of one would not be saved from abuses at the hands of the other
 is prakaar jon lock kii bhashaa main kanoon kaa matlab he jivan, swatantraaa or sampatti kii raksha ke liye kanoon
 Liberalism theory makes it clear what should be the methods of making and enforcing the law
 udaahranarth, kanoon nirvaachit vidhikrttaaon dwaara aapasi vichaar-vimarsh ke dwaara kiya janaa chahie
 Secondly, no law can be enforced from the previous date, because in that case it will punish the citizens for the works which were done according to the then law
 isi tarah udaarataavaadi kanoon krur or amanviya kism kii sazaayen dene ke viruddh hota he
 An impartial judiciary, independent of political influences, is set up so that it can be decided by the parties on the basis of systematic interpretation of the law
 marxvaadiyon kii manyata he ki kanoon ke shashan kii avadharana vyaktigat swatantraaa kii guarantee karne ke naam par sampatti sambandhi adhikaron kii raksha karte hue poonjeewaadi vyavastha kii suraksha ke kaam aati he
 This results in social inequality and class dominance
 marks kanoon ko raajnneeti or vichaardhaara kii bhanti us superstracchar yaa adhirachana kaa hissaa maanate hai jiskaa base yaa aadhaar poonjeewaadi utpaadan kii vidhi par rakhaa jaataa he
 Feminists have also criticized the concept of the rule of law that it is not based on gender fairness
 isiilie nyaaypalika or kanoon ke peshey par purushon kaa kabza rahata he
 Advocates of multiculturalism argue that the law represents the values and attitudes of dominant cultural groups
 parinamswaroop alpsankhyak or hashiyagrast samoohon ke mulya or sarokaar nazarandaaz kiye jate rahete hai
 Philosophers have been beaming from the beginning on the question of the difference between law and morality
 kanoon kaa aadhaar naitik pranali main maanane waalon kaa vishwaas ‘prakritik kanoon’ ke siddhant main he
 Plato and after him Aristotle believed that there is a close relationship between law and morality
 ek nyaaypurna samaaj vahi ho saktaa he jisamen kanoon naitik niyamon par aadhaarit pragna kii pushti karte hon
 Medieval Christian thinker Thomas Aquina also believed that in order to live a good life on this earth, there should be laws according to natural law i
e
 God-given morals
 unnisvin sadi main buddhivaad or vaigyanik drushtikon kii pratishtha badhane ke kaaran prakritik kanoon kaa siddhant nishprabhavi hota chalaa gaya
 There were attempts to free the law from moral, religious and mystic beliefs
 jon austin ne ‘vidhik pratyakshthawaad’ kii sthapana kii jiskaa daawa tha ki kanoon kaa sarokaar kisi ucchtar naitik yaa dharmik usul se na ho kar kisi samprabhu vyakti yaa sanstha se hota he
 The law is therefore law that has to be obeyed and done
 vidhik pratyakshthawaad kii kahin adhik vyaavhaarik or nafis vyakhya ech
el
e
 heart kii rachana 'da concept of lau' main milti he
 Hart defines the law in the context of human society by removing it from the purview of moral rules
 unke mutabik kanoon pratham or dwitiyak niyamon kaa sanyog he
 Calling the first class rules as 'the essence of law', Hart says that they are related to the regulation of social behavior
 jaise, faujadaari kanoon
 Second-class rules instruct government institutions on how to make laws, how to implement them, how to make decisions on the basis of it and how to establish its legitimacy on these grounds
 heart dwaara pratipaadit vidhik pratyakshthawaad ke siddhant kii aalochana raajnneetik darshanik ronold dwarkin ne kii he
 According to him, the law is not merely a code of rules, nor do modern law systems provide a uniform way to establish the law's validity
 kanoon or naitikta ke bich sambandh kii bahes naziyon ke atyaacharon ko dandit karne vaale neuramberg mukademe main bhi uthi thi
 The question was whether those acts which were done in accordance with national law could be held a crime? To answer this, the concept of natural law was resorted to, but expressed in the language of human rights
 darasal kanoon or naitikta ke rishte kaa prashn behad jatil he or garbhpaat, veshyavriti, pornographi, tivi or filmon main dikhaai jane vaali hinsa, apni kokh kiraye par dene vaali maataaon or genetic ejineering jaise masalon ke sadanrbh main baar-baar uthati rahati he

 But the social status of Hardy's family was not such that he could be sent to university for education, and at the age of 16, his formal education ended and he became an apprentice to John Hicks, a local architect

 During this period, his Dorset friend Horace Moll introduced him to the work of Charles Fournier and Auguste Comte
 Five years later, due to his health he returned to Dorset and decided to dedicate himself to writing

 phir bhi vah apni pehali patni kii maut se ubhar nahin paae or kavy-lekhan se apane dukh ko bhulane kii koshish karte rahe
 In December 1927, Hardy succumbed to pleurisy and passed away after writing his final poem to his wife at 9 pm on 11 January 1928; The cause of death was cited in the death certificate, "heartburn", "old age" was cited as a contributing factor
 16 janvari ko unka antim sanskaar westminster ebe main hua jo ek vivaadaaspad avasar sabit hua kyonki hardi, unke parivaar or mitron kii ichha thi ki unhen stinsuard main unki pehali patni yema kii kabr main hi dafanaaya jaae

 apni aatmakatha gudby tu ol dait main robert grevs ne 1920 ke dashak ke shuru main dorset main hardi ke saath bhent kii yaad ko tazaa kiya he
 Hardy warmly welcomed him and his new wife and praised her work
 1910 main, hardi ko order of merit se sammanit kiya gaya
 Hardy's houses at Bockhampton and Max Gate in Dorchester are owned by the National Trust
 hardi ne kavitalekhan se sahityaseva aarambh kii, kintu praathmik rachanaayen unhone nasht kar deen
 From 1870 to 1898 he enriched the narrative
 ve jivan or sansar ke parichaalan main koi nyaay athwa vyavastha na dekhte the unke anusaar ek andhi shakti is jagat ke kaaryakalapon kaa parichaalan karti thi
 He used to call this blind power 'willful' - the demeanor that lies in life and the world
 apane kathasahitya main hardi ne jagat ke vyapaaron par apana akraman uttarottar adhik tikhaa kiya
 In earlier novels it is relatively mild
 1879 main unki pehali uplabdh rachana prakashit hui, 'desparat remedies', 1872 main duusari, 'under di greenwood tree' or 1873 main teesri 'e peyar ov blue ij'
 The next work 'far from the Madding Crowd' is a more mature work and gained fame after its publication
 aatmavishvaas praapt kar hardi ne vishwa kii gati par apana aghat adhik teevr kar diya
 The best works of this period are - 'the Woodlanders', 'the Return of the Native', 'the Trumpet Major' and 'the Mayor of Wasterbridge'
 iske baad do upanyaas or likhe gaye jinamein hardi ghor niraashaa main dub gaye hai
 Fearing the critics, Hardy quit writing novels and began writing poetry
 bees varsh tak unhone kavita likhi or apane liye khyaati ke nae dwaar khole
 Hardy continued to express his views in poetry as well, but the trauma expressed in the poems did not maim readers and critics to that extent
 hardi kaa kahana tha ki 'yadi galileo ne kavita main likhaa hota ki prithvi gumti he, to shaayad unhen itani takalif na sahani padati
 Hardy turned to the first love of his literary life by adopting poetry once again
 isi bich inhone apni sabase mahatvapurn kriti 'di dyenasts' likhi
 It was published in three parts
 yah rachana naatak ke rup main mahakavy he
 It cannot be played at physical theater
 iskaa abhinay kalpana ke manch par hi sambhav he
 The story relates to Napoleon's expedition
 yah vishwavijeta bhi krur niyati kaa shikaar tha
 The power of life keeps rotating the cycle and all the virtuous and vicious people keep grinding in it
 is rachana main hardi kaa vichaardarshan bahut spashtataa se vyakt hry he
 Hardy's family believed in the Anglican Church but were not staunch followers
 paanch saptaah kii umr main unka baptism hua or vah carch ko jaaya karte the, jahaan unke pita or chachaa sangeet ke liye yogadan dete the
 Still he did not attend the school of the local Church of England, he was sent to Mr
 Last's school three miles away
 noujvaan yuva ke rup main, unki dosti henri aar
 basto se hui jisane vaastukar chaatr ke rup main bhi kaam kiya or jo baptist carch main vayask baptism kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 Hardy considered converting but decided not to convert again
 basto australia chalaa gaya, lambey arase tak unke bich patrachaar chalata rahaa lekin antat hardi is aadan-pradaan se thak gaye or patrachaar band ho gaya
 With this, Hardy's relationship with Baptist ended
 jivan main bhagya ke bare main hardi kaa vichaar parameshwar ke saath darshanik sangharsh main parilakshith hua
 Although Hardy's faith remained intact, he questioned the traditional Christian view of God because of the irony and struggles of life: hardi ke dharmik jivan main agyeyavaad, aastikta or aadhyatmavaad kaa mila-jula rup dekhne ko miltaa he
 Once, when a pastor asked the letter to reconcile the torture of suffering with the righteousness of the loving God, Hardy replied, phir bhi, hardi aksar brahmad ko niyantrit karne vaali alokik shaktiyon ke bare main sochaa karte the or likhaa karte the, vah aisa kisi drudh vishwaas kii bajaae nirpeksh bhav main or mouj main aakar karte the
 In addition, Hardy's writings also reveal to some extent his attraction to ghosts and spirits
 in bhaawanaaon ke baavjood, hardi isai upasna or carch kii rasmon se bhaavnaatmak rup se jude rahe, visheshkar jo gramin samudaayon main prachlit hai, jivan ke praarambhik varshon main un par inkaa bahut nirmaanatmak prabhaav padaa or hardi ke anek upanyaason main bible sandarbhon kii bharmaar dekhi ja sakati he
 Hardy's friends included Horace Moll and poet William Barnes, both pastors, during John Hicks' apprenticeship here
 mal zindagi bhar hardi ke kareebi dost rahe or bible kii shabdic vyakhya par andeh uthaane vaali nai vaigyanik khojon se jaise ki gidon mentel kii, unka parichay karavaaya 
 mal ne 1858 main hardi ko mentel kii pustak da vanders of jiyology kii prati di, adelin bacland kaa vichaar he ki mentel ke bhuvaigyanik varnan or e peyar of blue aaiz ke "clifahanger" vaale khand main "akatya samanthaayen" hai
 It has also been suggested that the character of Henry Knight in a Pair of Blue Eyes was based on Horace Moll
 1867 main purna kiya gaya hardi kaa pehla upanyaas, da pier main and da ladi ko prakashit karne ke liye koi prakaashak raji nahin hua or hardi ne pandulipi nasht kar di, isliye upanyaas ke kuch hisse hi uplabdh hai
 His mentor and friend, Victorian novelist and poet George Meredith, encouraged him to try again
 desparit remedies or under da greenwood tree agyaat rup se prakashit kiye gaye the
 In 1873 Hardy's novel a Pair of Blue Eyes, based on his love for his first wife, was published under his own name
 "clifahanger" shabd kaa udbhav is kahani ke dharawahik roopaantar se mana jaataa he jisamen ek nayak henri nite ko vastav main chattan se latakta hua chhod diya jaataa he
 Hardy said that he first introduced Wessex in his next novel, From the Madding Crowd
 yah itnaa safal rahaa ki hardi ne vaastushilp kaa kaam chhodkar sahitya ko apni jivan-vritti ke rup main apana liya
 Over the next twenty-five years, Hardy wrote more than ten novels
 hardi parivaar landan se yeovil or phir sterminster newton chalaa gaya, jahaan unhone da ritern of da netive kii rachana kii
 In 1885, he moved to Max Gate, a house designed by Hardy outside Dorchester and built by his brother
 yahaan unhone da meyar of casterbrij, da woodlanders or tess of di diurbarwills likhe, inamen se antim upanyaas main "patit stri" ke sahanubhutipurna chithran kii kaafii aalochana kii gai or shuru main iske prakaashan se inkaar kar diya gaya tha
 Its subtitle, a Pure Woman: Faithfully Presented, was intended to point fingers at the middle class of the Victoria era
 1895 main prakashit jud da obscyor main yon ke mukt vivechan kii victorian janata ne ore bhi ninda kii or ise praayah "jud da obsin" kahkar pukaara jaataa tha
 Highly condemned for hurting the institution of marriage by presenting concepts like orgasm, the book put further negative pressure on Hardy's previously disastrous marital life as Emma Hardy worried that Jude the Obscure was read as an autobiography Will go
 Some booksellers sold the novel in brown envelopes and it is said that the Bishop of Wakefield burned his copy
 1912 ke apane upsanhaar main, hardi ne is ghatana kaa hawala mazaaq ke taur par pustak ke karier kaa bhaag kahkar diya: "press ke in faisalon ke baad iskaa aglaa durbhaagya ek bishap dwaara jalaayaa janaa tha - shaayad mujhe na jala paane kii hataasha main"
 Despite this criticism, by the early 1900s, Hardy had made his place in English literature by writing several highly successful novels, but public reaction to his two great works aroused disinterest and left him writing the novel altogether
 hardi dwaara likhit anya upanyaason main shaamil he khagol vigyaan ke jagat par aadhaarit ek prem kahani tu on e tower Although he wrote a lot of poems but remained mostly unpublished until 1898, Hardy is best remembered for his series of novels and short stories written between 1871 and 1895
 unke upanyaas vesex, dakshin or dakshin pashchim england kaa vishaal kshetra jiskaa naam us kshetra ke anglo-sackson rajya ke naam par padaa, ke kaalpanik jagat kii prishthbhumi main rachit hai
 Hardy was part of two worlds
 apane bachapan ke gramin jivan se bhi unka gaharaa bhaavnaatmak lagaav tha par saath hi vah ho rahe parivartanon or prachlit saamaajik samasyaon, krishi kshetra main nawacharon se - audyogic kranti ke kaaran angreji dehaat main hue parivartanon se zaraa pehle ke yug kii nabz pakadaney se lekar - victorian samaaj ke yon vyavhaar ke anauchity or paakhand ke prati vah jaagruk the Hardy was a critic of social bonds that hampered the lives of people living in the 19th century
 victoria kaal ke yathartwaadee lekhak maane jane vaale hardi ne saamaajik bandhanon ko parkhaa jo victorian yathasthiti kaa hissaa hai or mana ki ye bandhan sabhi shaamil logon ke jivan main baadha daalate hai or aakhirkaar dukh kaa kaaran banate hai
 In Two on a Tower, Hardy is seen voicing these rules and creating a story against the backdrop of social structure, a tale of love that transcends class boundaries
 pathak prem ke liye sthapit paramparaon ko todane kaa vichaar karne par majaboor ho jaataa he
 These traditions are applicable in nineteenth-century society and social pressure ensures their compliance
 swithin saint clive kaa adarshavaad unhen samakaleen saamaajik bandhanon ke mukaable main khadaa kar detaa he
 a self-willed man has to face strict control of social rules and ethics

 yah dekhakar unke mata pita ne unka vivaah karne kaa nishchay kiya, parantu babaaji unke prastaav ko asvikaar karke or ghar parivaar ko chhod kar ‘ param siddhi ’ kii raah par nikal pade
 And one day he encountered "swami Dattatreya" in Girnar hill of Junagadh and it is here that Babaji took the basic teachings of "siddha" from Swami Dattatreya and became "siddha"
 tabhi se unhen “ baba balakanath ji” kaha jane laga
 Two separate evidences of Babaji are still available, which is still evidence of his presence, one of which is "garun tree"
 This tree is still present in Shahtalai, under this tree Babaji used to do penance

 Once, Ratno was criticizing Babaji for not taking proper care of cows, whereas Ratno used to take care of Babaji's food
 ratno kaa itnaa hi kahana tha ki babaaji ne ped ke tane se roti or zamin se lassi ko uttpann kar diya
 Babaji practiced celibacy all his life and keeping this in mind, his female devotee does not enter the 'garbhagufa' which is situated in the natural cave where Babaji had gone to meditation while doing penance

 The principle of dependence in international politics is that resources flow from the poor and underdeveloped countries to the rich countries and make the rich countries richer by making the poor countries poorer
 nirbharta kaa siddhanth is mul manyata par aadhaarit he ki rajnatik evam aarthik karkon ke bich ek gahan sambandh hota he
 These two factors affect each other and significant changes are seen in politics depending on economic factors
 nirbharta kaa siddhanth mul rup se marxvad se prabhavit rahaa he
 Hobson and Lenin's concept of imperialism, along with Marxism, has made it stronger
 parantu chunki marxvaadi 'rajya' ke astitv ko nahin maanate isiilie ise 'nav-marxvaadi' avadharana maananaa zyada tarksangat hoga
 Although this concept has existed in international politics since the 1950s, but has become more important since the 1970s
 is kaal ke antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan hetu raajnneetik-aarthik tatwon main sambandh par adhik bal diya jane laga he
 The main proponents of this theory are Paul Baran, Paul Sweezy, Harry Madgaff, Andrei Gundar Frank, Agahiri Emmanuel, Sameer Amin, Emmanuel Wallersten etc
 1970 ke dashak ke baad yah siddhanth bahut mahatvapurn ban gaya
 Discussion of this principle was given more emphasis due to the following reasons- is siddhanth ko paribhaashit karnaa ati kathin he, kyonki alag-alag lekhakon ne vibhinn prakaar se isaki vyakhya prastut karne kii koshish kii he
 Mainly various scholars believe that - is siddhanth ko vishleshan kii suvidha hetu do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he- Many scholars have seen this principle as an economic and political interaction between the 'center' and 'periphery' nations
 mul rup main unki soch main vishesh antar nahin dikhaai padataa, parantu kisi kaarak vishesh ko adhik va kam mahatv kii drushti se unhen teen shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he jiskaa vivaran is prakaar se he - The author of this class can be named Raoul Prabisich, who was the chairman of the South American Economic Commission of the United Nations
 iske saath-saath phurtado va shankal ko bhi isi varg main shaamil mana ja saktaa he
 Scholars advocating this idea consider the international system to be divided into states of center and periphery
 unke anusaar utpaadan ke paramparaagat tareekon se kendra ke rashtron ke paas atyaadhik smapda ikatthi ho gai he
 That is why those scholars believe that development and non-development or underdevelopment cannot be separated, rather these are two sides of the same coin
 iske atirikt, na hi aaj aantarik va bahya karkon ke bich antar rakhaa ja saktaa he, balki donon ek duusare se jude hue hai
 That is why only after the basic industrial development of Latin American countries can they be liberated from colonial and imperialist bonds
 parantu is varg ke vichaarkon kii udaaravaadi evam pragatisheel donon hi ne aalochana kii he
 Liberals say that they do not study the impact of the business cycle on the economic development process
 jabaki pragatisheel vidwaanon kaa aarope yah he ki sanrachanaatmak skool se jude log shoshan ke bare main uchit va sahi adhyayan karne main asaksham rahe hai
 In addition, these scholars also ignore the fact that development in the periphery countries is nothing but the globalization of technologies by the center nations
 is mat se jude logon main pramukh hai andrigunder frank, paal baraan, samin amin aadi
 These scholars consider the world system divided into 'metros' and 'satellites'
 phank kaa maananaa he ki poonjeevaad ke madhyam se hameshaa ‘upgrahon’ vaale rajyon main 'gaiyr-vikaas kaa vikaas' hota he
 Metropolitan nations make them more underdeveloped by the dividends of their additional capital
 upgrahon vaale rajyon main 'aviksitata kaa vikaas' ek sampoorn aitihaasik prakriya kaa hi hissaa he, apane aap main koi swatantra gatividhi nahin he
 That is why whenever these satellite nations have a weak bond with the metropolitan nations, they have increased their growth rate and the process has been opposite when they have been more connected to them
 isiilie kisi raashtra main pichhadepan kaa vikaas poonjivadi vyavastha main us rajya ke padsopan ke aadhaar par adhyayan kii ja sakati he
 In addition, it can also be evaluated on the basis of the economic structures established in that society
 is mat kii bhi do aadhaaron par aalochanaayen kii gai hai - pratham, puunji kii uplabdhta va poonjeevaad do alag-alag bindu hai so unhen ek nahin maananaa chahie
 Second, it cannot be established solely on the basis of the theory that how development has led to backwardness in Latin American countries
 teesraa varg un vichaarkon kaa he jo nirbharta va vikaas ke sambandhon ko judaa maanate hai
 Prominent thinkers among them are Cardoso, Faleto and Oswaldo Shankel
 inkaa maananaa he ki aitihaasik-sanrachanaatmak drushti se dakshini america deshon main puunji nivesh ke sandarbh main moolbhoot parivartan aaye hai
 They believe that capital investment has been invested in ready-made goods rather than agricultural or raw material products, and its associated joint ventures have been supported by local and external investors
 isiilie nirbharta, poonjeevaad varchasv va vikaas virodhabhspurn na hokar teesri duniya ke deshon main ek sangrahit varchasv sthapit karne kii sthiti rahi he
 That is why the need for urban population of third world countries has been met by external multinational companies by increasing the product of consumer goods
 isiilie in samaajon kii sanrachanaatmak vyavastha main bikharaav paidaa kar diya gaya he
 That is why these multinational companies have created a state of dependency-related development in third world countries
 yadhyapi is varg ke vichaarkon ne ek purv nirdhaarit vyakhya se alag hatakar nai vyakhya di he, parantu isse varg ke siddhanth ko ek mul ikai ke rup main uchit prayog nahin kiya ja sakaa
 There are some differences in views in the above three sections and it is different from traditional Marxism in many respects
 parantu yah satya he ki in sabhi ke anusaar aarthik vikaas kii drushti se ‘paridhi’ vaale raashtra aaj bhi mahanagareey kendron par nirbhar hai
 For this reason perhaps 'development of development' is happening in metros and 'development of development' in periphery nations
 nirbharta siddhanth ke hi anya rup ko vishwa-pranali siddhanth ke antargat bhi adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Although some thinkers consider these two to be different, there is no difference in the basic beliefs of both
 antar keval vyakhya ko lekar he
 Therefore, it is more appropriate to accept it as a form of dependency
 vishwa pranali siddhanth ke pramukh praneta emenual walrusten ko kaha ja saktaa he jinhone apni pustak da modern world system main iskaa vistrut ullekh kiya he
 Wallerstein believes that two types of world systems are found in history - 'world empire' and 'world economy'
 donon main mukhya antar yah he ki sansadhano ke bantwaare ke bare main kis prakaar se nirnay liye jate hai
 They believe that in the 'world empire' system, power is used to divide resources from 'periphery states' to 'center states'
 iske vipareet vishwa arthvyavastha pranali main ek kendriyakrut raajnneetik dhaanche kaa abhaav hota he
 Therefore, instead of distributing resources by law, it is done through the market
 is prakaar yaddhapi sansadhano ke bantwaare ke sambandh main donon ke tareeke bhinn hai parantu donon kaa hi kul parinaam ek samaan he
 That is, the transfer of resources from the periphery nations to the central states
 walrusten ke anusaar 'kendra rashtron' kii visheshta he - prajatantric sarkarein, ucch vetan, kachche maal kaa aayaat, taiyarshuda maal kaa niryaat, ucch puunji nivesh, kalyankari sevaayen aadi
 On the contrary, 'periphery nations' have characteristics - non-democratic government system, export of raw materials, import of finished goods, low level pay, lack of welfare services
 parantu walrusten nirbharatavaadiyon se thodaa bhinn hai
 Apart from the center and periphery, they also consider a third class of nations as 'equal periphery'
 is prakaar ke rashtron kii visheshtaayen hai - sattatmak sarkarein, kachche va taiyaar maal kaa niryaat, taiyaar maal va kachche maal kaa aayaat, kam vetanman, nimna stareey kalyankari sevaayen aadi
 Wallerstein also believes that these three categories of nations are linked with exploitative modes of production through which the transfer of wealth is taking place towards the center states of the periphery
 iskaa maananaa he ki kramik utaar-chadhaav, dharmanirpeksh paddati evam virodhabhaason ke kaaran vishwa pranali main sankat aate hai
 These crises lead to the birth of a new world order
 walrusten ke vishwa pranali siddhanth kii marxvaadiyon evam gaiyr-marxvaadiyon donon hi ne aalochanaayen kii he
 Some authors, such as Chase and Poon, believe that Wallerstein limited it to only economic factors, while other factors also play an important role
 dwitiya, frank va gil kaa maananaa he ki walrusten ne is saare prakaran ko europe kendrit bana kar rakh diya jiske utpatti madhyayugin europe se maani jaati he
 But if a deep study is made, the roots of the present world system are stronger than in medieval Europe
 uparokt donon hi avasthaaon main adhyayan ke pashchaat ham kah sakate hai ki nirbharta ke siddhanth kii pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai - The principle of dependence has been criticized on the following major grounds: uparokt aalochanaon ke baavjood is siddhanth kii upyogita ko bhi nakaara nahin ja saktaa jo nimnlikhit hai- Therefore, it can be concluded that through the principle of dependence, an attempt has been made to study the changed nature of the world system through the relations between the center and the periphery nations
 is siddhanth ke madhyam se vartmaan va aitihaasik sandarbhon main samanvay paidaa karne ke saath-saath poonjeevaad ke parinamswaroop rashtron ke sambandhon ko samajhane ke uchit prayaas kiye gayi hai
 Although the views of different scholars differ, there seems to be a general consensus on economic factors or capitalism's importance in understanding the international politics
 lekin is siddhanth ke vrahat swaroop va vyashtipurvak adhyayan se is siddhanth main kai saiddhanthik va vyaavhaarik kamiyaan spasht jhalkati hai
 But the need is not to abandon this principle, but to carve it with more nuances
 kendra va paridhi rashtron ke bich utpann varchasv sthapit karne va vikaas avaruddh hone kii samasyaon ke gahan adhyayanon se nae samanyikarnon ke sthapit karne kii ati sheeghra aavashyaktaa he
 Politics gateway pakistan muslim lig kyuu yaa pakistan muslim lig kaayade ajam, pakistan kii ek prabud or udaaravaadi party he

 This group is generally considered an enlightened one

 Lathwaite himself participated in the development of a similar project called Tracked Hovercraft, although the funding of the project was canceled in 1973
 swaabhaavik rup se raikhik motor kaa istemaal meglev pranaaliyon ke liye bhi kaaphi anukool tha
 In the early 1970s, Lathwaite discovered a new arrangement of magnets that allowed a single linear motor to generate levitation as well as a forward push, creating a maglev system with only a set of magnets

 Description of an early modern type of maglev train R
 Polgreen's US patent 31,58,765, was made in the Magnetic System of Transportation
 sanyukt rajya america ke ek ekasv adhikaar main "meglev" kaa istemaal pehali baar canadian patents and deveopment limited dwaara "magnetic lavittesan gidence " main kiya gaya tha
 The term "maglev" refers not only to vehicles specifically designed for magnetic levitation and propulsion, but also to railway systems
 meglev praudyogiki ke sabhi sanchaalanaatmak karyanvayanon main pahiyedaar train praudyogiki ke saath nunatam adhivyapan he or paramparaagat rail trek ke anukool nahin hai
 Since they cannot share existing infrastructure, these maglev systems must be built as perfect transport systems
 applide lavittesan espm meglev system ispaat kii rail kii patariyon ke saath antar-sanchaalaneey he or yah meglev vaahanon or paaramparik trainon ko ek hi samay ek hi raste par chalane kii anumati detaa tha
 In Germany, MAN also built a maglev system that worked with traditional tracks but was never fully developed
 meglev praudyogiki ke vishesh rup se do ullekhneey prakaar hai: There is another experimental technology - a magnetic accelerator suspension, designed, proven mathematically, reviewed by colleagues and granted an authorization, but still not built, to lift the train and make it It uses the attractive magnetic force of a permanent magnet table near a steel track to establish it at its intended location
 pratikaarak sthaayee chumbak or atichaalak chumbak jaisi anya praudyogikiyon main kai anusandhan kiye gaye hai
 In existing electromagnetic suspension systems, the train rises on a steel track while the electromagnets attached to the train are tilted downward toward the track
 is pranali ko aam taur par si-aakaar vaali bhujaaon kii ek shrinkhalaa par vyavasthit kiya jaataa he or bhujaa kaa upree bhaag vaahan se sanlagn hota he or or nichalaa bhaag bhitari kinare main chumbak se sambaddh hota he
 The tracks lie between the upper and lower edges
 chumbakeey aakarshan duuri ke ghan ke saath badalata rahata he, isliye chumbakon or patari ke bich kii duuri main kiye gaye maamuli parivartanon kii vajah se bhi bahut zyada parivartaneey bal utpann hota he
 These changes in force are dynamically unstable - it can increase if there is even a slight deviation in the optimum position and complex systems of feedback control to maintain a train at an unchanging distance from the track)
 Is required
 nilambit meglev pranaaliyon kaa ek pramukh laabh yah he ki ve har tarah kii gati par kaam karti hai, jabaki vidyut gatibodhak pranaliyaan kam se kam lagbhag 30 kimi prati ghante kii gati par hi kaam karti hai
 This eliminates the need for a separate low-speed suspension system and as a result can simplify the track layout
 iskaa nakaaratmak paksh yah he ki is pranali kii gatyaatmak asthirataa ke liye trek kaa atishishnu jaruri he, jo is laabh ko ulat, yaa samaapt kar saktaa he
 As a result of the extreme confusion of this concept, Lathwaite was concerned that to build a track with the expected tolerance, the gap between the magnets and the rails would have to be increased to the point where the magnets would be improperly large
 vyavhaar main, is samasya ko pratipushti pranaaliyon ke vardhit pradarshan ke madhyam se sambodhit kiya jaataa tha, jo pranali ko gahan sahishnutaa ke saath chalane kii anumati pradaan karata he
 In electromagnetic suspension, both the track and the train exert a force on a magnetic field and the train is levitated due to the repulsive force between these magnetic fields
 yaa to vidyut chumbakon yaa sthaayee chumbakon kii ek sarani dwaara train main chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he
 The repulsive force in the track is created by an induced magnetic field in the wires or by other conductors in the track
 pratikaarak meglev pranaaliyon kaa ek pramukh laabh yah he ki ye prakritik rup se sthir hote hai - trek or chumbakon ke bich kii duuri main maamuli sankuchan se bahut adhik bal utpann hota he jo chumbakon ko waapas unki mul sthiti main pahunchaa detaa he, jabaki duuri main ek halki si vruddhi bal ko kam kar detii he or ek baar phir vaahan sahi algaav main laut jaataa he
 No feedback control is necessary
 pratikarik pranaaliyon kaa ek pramukh nakaaratmak paksh bhi he
 At slow speeds, the induced current in these coils and the resulting magnetic flux is not high enough to support the weight of the train
 is vajah se uttolan ko banaae rakhane kii kshamta vaali gati tak pahunchane tak train ko sahaara dene ke liye train main pahiyon yaa kuch anya prakaar ke landing gear kaa hona bahut jaruri he
 Since the train, for example, can stop at any location due to equipment malfunction, the entire track must have the ability to support both low-speed and high-speed operation of the train
 iskaa ek or nakaaratmak paksh yah he ki pratikaarak pranaliyaan swaabhaavik rup se utthapak chumbakon ke saamne or peeche trek main ek aise kshetra kaa nirmaan karti hai jo chumbakon ke viruddh kaam karata he or ek tarah se khinchaav kii sthiti utpann karata he
 This is generally a concern for low-speed systems, in high-speed systems it does not take much time for this effect to dominate its overall capacity and other types of stretch
 karshan bal kaa istemaal vidyut gatibodhak pranali ke laabh ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki, kyonki yah patariyon main ek parivartaneey bal utpann karata he jiskaa istemaal train ko chalaane ke liye ek pratikriyaavaadi pranali ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen alag se ek pratikriya plate kii jarurat nahin he, jaisaa ki adhikansh raikhik motor pranaaliyon main hota he
 Lathwaite led the development of systems such as "transit-flow" in his laboratory at Imperial College
 vaikalpik rup se, guideway ke pranodan coilon kaa istemaal train ke chumbakon par bal lagane ke liye or train ko aage kii taraf badhaane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The propulsion coils exerting a train are effectively a linear motor: a variable current flowing through the coils creates a continuously variable magnetic field that moves forward along the track
 train kii gati kaa milan karne ke liye parivartansheel dhara kii aavriti kaa tulykaalan kiya jaataa he
 The backlash between the area formed by the force of the magnets in the train and the applied field produces a force that moves the train forward

 Vibration issues may arise due to the inherent instability of the system and the continuous improvement required by external systems
 na to indukatrack or na hi superkandacting idies main ek sthir vaahan ko uttolit karne kii kshamta hoti he, haalanki indukatrack ek bahut hi nimna gati ke liye uttolan pradaan karata he; in pranaaliyon ke liye pahiyon kii jarurat padati he
 EMS systems are wheel-less

 If the power of the guideway is lost in a dynamic state, using the power of the onboard batteries, the transrapid is still capable of generating levitation at a speed of 10 km / h
 lekin echesasti or rotem pranaaliyon ke saath aisa nahin hota he
 An EDS system can facilitate both levitation and propulsion using an onboard linear motor
 iemes pranaliyaan onboard chumbakon kaa istemaal karke train ko uttolit kar sakati hai, lekin ise aage kii taraf prerit nahin kar sakati hai
 Because vehicles require some other technologies for propulsion
 trek main sthapit ek raikhik motor is samasya kaa ek samaadhaan he
 a propeller or jet engine may be used in case of long distances with prohibitive cost of propulsion coils
 arnashow ke prameya se pataa chalata he ki sthir chumbakon kaa koi bhi sangyojan ek sthir santulan main nahin ho saktaa he
 However, various levitation systems perform stationary levitation in violation of the assumptions of Arnshaw's theorem
 arnashow kaa prameya maanata he ki chumbakon kii kshetra shakti sthitik evam aparivartansheel hoti he or yah bhi ki saapeksh pargamyata sthir hoti he or iskaa maan har jagah 1 se adhik hota he
 EMS systems rely on active electronic stabilization
 aisi pranaliyaan lagaataar vahan duuri ko maapan or tadnusaar vidyut chumbak kii dhara kaa samaayojan karti hai
 All EDS systems are dynamic systems
 chunki meglev vaahan multah udati hai, isliye pich, role evam vichlan ke sthirikaran ke liye chumbakeey praudyogiki kii jarurat padati he
 Additionally with some technologies, problems of conversion, enhancement, rotation or fluctuation may arise
 kuch pranaliyaan nal flux pranaaliyon kaa istemaal karti hai, jise nal karant pranaaliyon ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, ye pranaliyaan ek aise coil kaa istemaal karti hai jo ghumaya hua hota he jisase yah do virdohi, parivartansheel kshetron main pravesh karata he
 When the vehicle is in a straight line, no current flows, but if it moves away from the line, a variable current is generated that creates an area that pushes it back into the line
 
 kuch pranaliyaan vaikatrain—vaayu karshan ko nunatam banane ke liye meglev praudyogiki yukt gaadi main istemaal kii jane vaali rikt tub—ke istemaal kaa prastaav detii hai
 It has great potential to increase speed and efficiency, while much of the energy of conventional maglev trains is lost to air traction
 rikt tubon main sanchalit hone vaale trainon ke yatriyon ke liye ek sambhavit jokhim yah he ki train kii kharabi yaa durghatana kii sthiti main surang suraksha nigaraanee pranaaliyon dwaara tub par phir se dabaav daalane tak yatriyon ko cabin ke daab-pratikulan ke jokhim kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The RAND Corporation has designed a vacuum tube train that can theoretically cross the Atlantic or the US in 20 minutes
 meglev trainon ke liye urja kaa istemaal train main teji laane ke liye kiya jaataa he or ise phir se praapt kiya ja saktaa he jab train dhimaa ho jaataa he
 It is also used to levitate the train and stabilize the movement of the train
 hawa ke jariye train par bal lagane ke liye is urja kaa mukhya bhaag jaruri he
 In addition, some energy is used for air conditioning, heating, lighting and other miscellaneous systems
 bahut kam gati par uttolan ke liye istemaal hone vaali bijli kaa pratishat kaaphi mahatvapurn ho saktaa he
 Also the energy used for acceleration for very short distances could be considered
 lekin vaayu karshan par kaabo paane ke liye istemaal hone vaali bijli main veg ke ghan ke saath vruddhi hoti he or isliye ucch gati par haaavee ho jaati he or iemes meglev pranaaliyon ke liye trek dizine kaa kaam bindu-dar-bindu sevaaon ke alaava anya kisi bhi chiz ke liye chunauteepurn hota he
 The winding should be gentle, while the switches are very long and need to be taken care of to prevent it from breaking during the flow of electricity
 ek espm meglev pranali, jisamen vaahan sthaayee rup se trekon par uttolit hota he, electronic niyantran kaa upyog karke turant trekon ko switch kar sakate hai jahaan trek main koi gatisheel purje nahin hote hai
 a prototype SPM maglev train has also guided a radius of radius equal to the length of the train itself, indicating that a full-scale train must have the ability to guide a radius with a radius equal to or greater than that of a conventional train
 
 kai pranaaliyon ke liye, ek uttolan-se-karshan anupaat ko paribhaashit karnaa sambhav he
 For maglev systems, these ratios can be higher than aircraft
 This may increase the capacity per kilometer of the maglev
 haalanki, ucch paribhraman gati par, vayugatyatmak karshan uttolan prerit karshan se kaaphi adhik hota he
 Jet transport aircraft exploit lower air densities to reduce traction during cruises at considerable altitude, so despite the loss of their leverage-to-traction ratio, they can travel more efficiently than maglev trains at high speeds That operate on the sea surface
 Aircraft are also more flexible and can serve more destinations with the provision of appropriate airport facilities
 hawaii jahaazon ke vipareet, meglev train bijli dwaara sanchalit hote hai or is tarah inhen eendhan le jane kii jarurat nahin padati he
 Aircraft fuel becomes a major danger when accidents occur during takeoff and landing
