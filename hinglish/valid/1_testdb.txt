 Cooker cough or whooping cough or whooping cough is a bacterial infection that initially affects the nose and throat
 yah praayah 2 varsh se kam aayu ke bacchon kii shwasan pranali ko prabhavit karata he
 The disease is named on the basis that the person suffering from this disease makes a barking sound while breathing
 yah bordatella partusia kahalaane vaale jeevanu ke kaaran hota he
 This bacterium is spread among individuals by bacteria expelled by respiration
 yah tab hota he jab sankraman yukt vyakti khansate yaa cheenkte hai
 It also spreads due to contact with bodily fluids of persons with infection such as falling of nasal water
 ye lakshan lagbhag 6 saptaah tak rahete hai or ye 3 charnon main vibhajit hote hai - These symptoms include sneezing, watery eyes, runny nose, loss of appetite, loss of energy and coughing during the night
 in lakshanon main lagaataar khansate rahanaa or iske baad bhunkane jaisi aawaaj aana tab jabaki biimaar vyakti saans lene kaa prayaas karata he, aadi shaamil he
 Under this, the process of improvement comes while coughing is neither continuous nor serious

 This cooker cough is for younger age patients whose cough lasts for 2 weeks

 Now the question arises that how is this disease transmitted from one child to another? Children suffering from this disease have runny nose, sneeze and cough
 naak bahane ke kram main jo taral padaarth nikalataa he, isi ke dwaara beemaari failati he
 In order to leave the nose, mouth and breath during a cough or sneeze, the bacteria spreads to the surroundings and the environment, which causes infection in other children
 yah beemaari mukhyat: bacchon kii praarambhik avasthaa main, jab unke mata-pita ko unki beemaari kaa pataa nahin chalata, khel ke maidan main, ek bichhaavan par sone or ek hi bartan main khaane-pine ke kram main failati he
 It is not the case that the disease develops soon after the infection of germs
 rogaanuon ke akraman ke pashchaat lakshan dikhaai padane main ek se do saptaah kaa samay lag jaataa he
 The bacteria first come into contact with the inner surface of the respiratory tract and stick to the surface, where it starts to grow by getting the proper medium
 uske baad sataha par ghaav banataa he
 As a result, the place swells
 phir twachaa par necrosis kii kriya hoti he
 Due to necrosis, other bacteria start to grow rapidly in the skin
 itani prakriya puri hone main ek-do saptaah kaa samay lag jaataa he
 After that the disease starts showing its symptoms, which manifest in three parts
 shuru main bachche ke khaansee hoti he tathaa naak se pani bahata he
 Then slowly, the child does not have any problem due to coughing, but gradually it increases as the process of affecting the respiratory system increases continuously
 jaise-jaise shwasan-tantra prabhavit hota he khaansee or khansane kii gati badhati jaati he or ek samay aisa aata he ki khaansee kii vajah se rogi raat ko so nahin paata he
 Previously, who used to have cough only during awakening, now it also happens in sleep, due to which the child wakes up coughing
 yah sthiti do se chaar saptaah tak bani rahati he
 She then assumes her fierce and fierce appearance
 ab pehle kii apeksha or jaldi-jaldi khaansee kaa daura padane lagata he
 During this time a situation occurs that the child starts having difficulty in breathing
 uske baad saans lene ke kram main ek vishesh prakaar kii aawaaj nikalne lagati he, jaise-kisi kute ke rone kii aawaaj
 This sound is due to respiratory tract infection and the opening of the glottis, but that hoop-hoop sound is not always there
 uske baad khaansee ke saath gadhe rang kaa balgam nikalataa he
 One more thing is that when the cough is showing its gruesome form, then immediately after that it vomits and everyone eats and drinks
 khaansee ke dauraan jeebh kaa baar-baar munh se baahar aane ke kram main us par daant padane se ghaav ho jane kii sambhaavna atyadhik bad jaati he
 Due to frequent coughing, the face turns red
 baccha chintit rahane lagata he
 Many times, in a state of extreme apathy, baffled and confused, i cannot understand what punishment is being given to me

 He does not want to eat

 This vaccination is usually given in DTP combined with diphtheria, tetanus and cooker cough

 However, increased immunization after the age of 6 years is not recommended unless an infection has occurred
 is beemaari ke ilaaj ke liye antibiotics kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jo iske daure kii bhayaanakta ko kam kar detaa he
 If the disease is diagnosed in the initial stage, then the use of antibiotics can prove to be very beneficial
 irithromicine yaa ampisilin kaa prayog saat se das dinon tak kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays chloramphenicol is highly treated because this drug is highly inexpensive

 There are various ways of writing it mathematically
 falan ko satat paribhaashit karne ke liye prachlit paribhaasha nimna he: The set of real numbers is the function defined on subset i of R
 upasamucchy i ko falan f kaa kshetra kaha jaataa he
 Here i = r as a possible alternative, a set of whole numbers, closed intervals
 athwa khulaa interval Is included
 yahan a or b vaastavik sankhyaayein hai
 The function f at point c in its area is called continuous if the limit of function f when x is moving towards c is the value of f is real and it is leading to f
 ganitiya rup main likhane par : Here the following three conditions are necessary examples: falan f ko satat kaha jaataa he yadi yadi yah kshetra ke prayek bindu par satat he
 All polynomial functions, such as satat hai
 An example of a discrete function is a function defined as f = 1 if x> 0, f = 0 if x ≤ 0, taking ε = 1⁄2 to prove it
 yahan par x=0 ke lagbhag koi δ-parivesh nahin he jo kii f ke maan ko f ke nikat ε kii ore agrasar kare
 As a result, this type of discontinuity will be called an emergency surge
 isi tarah chihn falan is discrete at x = 0 otherwise continuous
 anya udhaaharan : falan is continuous except x = 0

 duusari ore faujee kanoon ek kanoonee pratyay kaa vichaar he, jiske dwaara naagarik nyaayalayon ne un asaadhaaran adhikaron ke niyantran kaa praytn kiya he jo karypalika dwaara rajya ke nagarikon par lagu karne ke liye adhigruhit kiye jate hai
 Thus military law is different from military law, which is the special law governing armed forces
 naagarik adhikaar ke prayog ke hetu jab sashastr sena se kaam liya jaataa he tab sena naagarik adhikariyon ke niyantran main hi apana kaary karti he or aparaadhiyon par saadhaaran nyaayalayon main vichaar hota he
 But in military law, the powers of civil officers and courts are suspended and criminals are prosecuted before the army commission
 englad main samrat ko sankatkaal ghoshit karne kaa adhikaar nahin he, kintu yuddh ke samay karypalika ko sansadeey vidhaan ke antargat tathaa tadnurup adhiniyamon ke antargat anek vyavasthaayen tathaa aadesh prasaarit karne ke vyapkadhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Nevertheless, the exercise of those rights takes place under the dual control of the Legislature and the Court
 amareeki vidhi main raashtrapati ko, congressi karrwai se swatantra, faujee kanoon ghoshit karne kaa kahan tak adhikaar he or us sthiti main vidhayika tathaa nyaayalayon dwaara kahan tak niyantran kiya ja saktaa he, yah ab bhi vivaad kaa vishay he tathaa is maamle main kanoonee sthiti ab bhi spasht nahin he
 In India too, in the absence of a clear constitutional directive, it is controversial who is entitled to declare a military law
 faujee kanoon sambandhi ullekh keval 34veen dhara main he, jo kisi vishesh kshetra main faujee kanoon uthaa liye jane ke baad kshatipurti adhinium kii vyavastha karti he
 But similar to military law, the President has the right under Section 359 to suspend judicial execution of the rights under Section 21 and 22
 yah samajha jaataa he ki yah mulat: faujee kanoon kaa hi rup he, kintu prathit hota he ki sarvocch nyaayalay ne ise vivaad ke liye chhod diya he jo ho, is sambandh main koi bhi mat apanaaya jaae, samvidhan kii dhara 352 ke antargat sankatkaal kii ghoshnaa kaa moulik adhikaron par prabhaav newnaadhik maatra main faujee kanoon jaisaa hi he
 Thus, as long as the crisis situation persists under section 358, the executive has the right to violate the provisions of section 19
 raashtrapati dwaara dhara 359 ke antargat sankatkalin avadhi tak yaa aadesh main ullikhit avadhi tak ke liye duusare moulik adhikaar bhi sthagit kiye ja sakate hai
 There is only so much control over the authority of the President that the declaration of crisis must be presented to Parliament for approval
 is ghoshnaa ko sansad ke samaksh prastut karne kii koi nishchit avadhi nahin hoti or na prastut kiye jane par kisi prakaar kaa dand kaa pravidhan hi he, kintu ghoshnaa ke prasaarit hone ke do maas pashchaat vah swat: samaapt ho jaati he
 There is no restriction on the President when one declaration ends and then another is issued
 dhara 359 ke antargat jari kiya gaya raashtrapati kaa aadesh sansad ke samaksh yathashighra prastut hona chahie
 It is left to the executive to decide the time of this presentation because even if the President's order is not presented before the Parliament, its effect is not reduced nor is there any system of legal action in the absence of submission
 san 1962 ke chini akraman ke dauraan, raashtrapati ne samvidhan kii 14, 21 or 22 dharao kaa nishpaadan sthagit karke sankatkalin sthiti kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The public was severely criticized for the excessive delay in announcing the declaration, even after the situation became quite normal
 is tathy ne sankatkalin adhikaron ke sambandh main kuch or sangrakshan lagane kii aavashyaktaa pragat kar di he, kyonki aisa na hone par koi bhi aviveki karyaadhikari apni suvidha ke liye samvidhan kaa unmoolan karke faujee kanoon ko sthaayee kar de saktaa he
 We have not yet forgotten that Weimar Constitution of Germany, according to which various kinds of tips were resorted to in order to not let the legal rule become permanent
 bharat main bhi is prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon ke prati udasin rahanaa uchit na hoga

 Wavelength: 10 km to 1 km nimna aavriti yaa LF ve radio aavriti hoti hai, jo ki 30 khz–300 khz ke madhya aati hai

 kyonki iskaa tarang dairghy das se ek kilometre hota he
 a 2
1 khz allocation, the 136 khz band, is available to amateur radio operators in some countries in Europe, New Zealand and French overseas dependencies
 The world record distance for a two-way contact is over 10,000 km from near Vladivostok to New Zealand
 As well as traditional Morse code many operators use very slow computer controlled Morse code or specialized digital communications modes
 a proposal at the WRC-07 World Radiocommunication Conference aims to make this a worldwide amateur radio allocation
 The UK allocated a 2
8 khz sliver of spectrum from 71
6 khz to 74
4 khz beginning in April 1996 to UK amateurs who applied for a Notice of Variation to use the band on a noninterference basis with a maximum output power of 1 w ERP 
 This was withdrawn on 30 june 2003 after a number of extensions in favor of the European-harmonized 136 khz band
 a 1-watt transmission of very slow Morse Code between G3AQC and W1TAG spanned the Atlantic Ocean for 3275 miles on November 21-22, 2001
 In the United States there is a special license free allocation in the longwave range called lowfer
 This experimental allocation between 160 khz and 190 khz is sometimes called the "lost Band"
 Unlicensed operation by the public is permitted south of 60 degrees north latitude, except where interference would occur to ten licensed location service stations located along the coasts
 Regulations for use include a power output of no more than 1 watt, and an antenna / ground-lead length of no more than 15 meters, and a field strength of no more than 4
9 microvolts / meter
 Also, emissions outside of the 160 khz – 190 khz band must be attenuated by at least 20 db below the level of the unmodulated carrier
 Many experimenters in this band are amateur radio operators
 a regular service transmitting RTTY marine meteorological information on LF is the German Meteorological Service 
 The DWD operates station DDH47 on 147
3 khz using standard ITA-2 alphabet with a transmission speed of 50 baud and FSK modulation with 85 Hz shift
 It is broadcast between 148

 dakshin desh ke devgiri parvat ke nikat sukarma naamak brahman apni pati parayan patni sudesh ke saath rahata tha
 Both of them were devotees of Shiva but worried about not having children
 patni ke aagrah par uske patni kii bahan ghusma ke saath vivha kiya jo param shiv bhakt thi
 By Shiva's grace he received a son's wealth
 isse sudesh car ishya hone lagi or usne avasar paa kar sout ke bete kii hatya kar di
 By the grace of Lord Shiva, the child rose up and on the request of Ghushma, gave him the boon to live there forever and started living there and the name of that pond, also known as Ghushmeshwar, has since become Shivalaya
 is jyotirling ke vishay main puraanon main yah katha varnit he- dakshin desh main devgiriparvat ke nikat sudharma naamak ek atyant tejasvi taponisht brahman rahata tha
 His wife's name was Sudeha
 The two had a lot of mutual love
 kisi prakaar kaa koi ksht unhen nahin tha
 But he had no child
 jyotish-gananaa se pataa chalaa ki sudeha ke garbh se santanotpatti ho hi nahin sakati
 Sudeha was very keen on children
 usne sudharma se apni choti bahan se doosraa vivaah karne kaa aagrah kiya
 At first Sudharma did not think about this
 lekin ant main unhen patni kii jid ke aage jhukna hi padaa
 They could not defer his request
 ve apni patni kii choti bahan ghushma ko byaah kar ghar le aae
 Ghushma was a very gracious and virtuous woman
 vah bhagavan shiv kii anany bhaktha thi
 She used to worship him with true devotion of heart by making one hundred and one earth shivling every day
 bhagwaan shivaji kii krupa se thode hi din baad uske garbh se atyant sundar or swasth balak ne janm liya
 The birth of the child did not cross the pleasure of both Sudeha and Ghushma
 donon ke din bade aaraam se biit rahe the
 But do not know how soon after a few days a misconception was born in Sudeha's mind
 vah sochane lagi, meraa to is ghar main kuch he nahin
 Everything belongs to Ghushma
 ab tak sudharma ke man kaa kuvichaar rupi ankur ek vishaal vriksh kaa rup le chukaa tha
 Finally one day he killed Ghushma's young son while sleeping at night
 uske shav ko le jaakar usne usee talab main phenk diya jisamen ghushma pratidin parthiv shivlingon ko phenkaa karti thi He also took possession of my husband
 santan bhi usee kii he
 This idea gradually grew in his mind
 idhar ghushma kaa vah balak bhi bada ho rahaa tha
 Gradually he became young
 uskaa vivaah bhi ho gaya
 Everyone came to know about this in the morning
 puure ghar main kuharaam much gaya
 Both Sudharma and his daughter-in-law beat their heads and wept bitterly
 lekin ghushma nity kii bhanti bhagavan shiv kii aradhana main tallin rahi
 As if nothing has happened
 puja samaapt karne ke baad vah parthiv shivlingon ko talab main chhodane ke liye chal padi
 When she started returning from the pond, her beloved Lal was seen coming out of the pond
 vah sadaa kii bhanti aakar ghushma ke charnon par gir padaa

 He was extremely enraged by Sudeha's heavy-handed actions
 apane trishul dwaara uskaa galaa kaatane ko udyat dikhalaai de rahe the
 Ghushma folded his hands and said to Lord Shiva - 'prabhu! If you are happy with me then forgive that unfortunate sister of mine
 nishchit hi usne atyant jaghanya paap kiya he kintu aapaki dayaa se mujhe meraa putr waapas mil gaya
 Now you forgive him and God! meri ek prarthana or he, lok-kalyaan ke liye aap is sthaan par sarvada ke liye nivas karen

 khagolashastra main rosh seemaa yaa rosh vyas brahmand main do vastuon ke gurutvkarshan ke talmail ke ek parinaam ko ujagar karata he
 Normally, any object collects itself under the influence of its own gravity, such as planets, satellites, etc
 lekin yadi koi duusari badi vastu paas main aa jaae to vah pehali vastu ke jamkar ek ho jane main khalal daalati he
 The light limit of any object is the limit within which that object does not allow any other object to accumulate fiercely
 saadhaaran taur par rosh seemaa kaa prayog grahon ke ird-gird mandaraate hue upgrahon ke liye hota he
 If the satellites are beyond the planetary limits, ordinary satellites are able to be made, otherwise the gravity of the planet is so powerful that it either does not allow it to become a large satellite, or it makes satellite satellites, or removes that debris from its And pulls it into itself
 kabhi-kabhi rosh seemaa ke andar bhi upgrah ban pate he
 This occurs when the satellite is not deposited solely by gravity and has some other chemical or physical cause of its material sticking together
 vaigyanik bhashaa main kaha ja saktaa he ke agar upgrah kii tanaav pushti adhik ho to vah rosh seemaa main rahakar bhi ekatrit rah saktaa he
 Jupiter's satellite Meetus and Saturn's satellite pan are two examples that remain intact even when they are within the Roche range
 lekin aise upgrahon main or ajeeb chizein dekhi ja sakati hai
 Because the gravity of a large planet on their surface has a great effect, if something is placed on its surface, sometimes it can spontaneously fly away from the surface in front of the eyes and be separated from the satellite

 About 136 years ago, Bohemian monk Gregor John Mendel published his experiments on pea seeds, which marked the beginning of a new era of genetics studies

 In 1926, Hermann Müller discovered that X-rays in the gene of Drosophila lead to genetic mutations, also known as mutations

 ye gunasutra protein tathaa neucleic amla se milakar bane hote hai
 Which is called DNA

 When a cell divides into two cells, then its genome also doubles
 koshika kaa vibhaajan hote samay di en e ke donon tantu pruthak ho jate hai or prayek tantu kaa ek nayaa sampoorak tantu, newcliotide peyaring yaa base peyaring ke niyam se banataa he
 Therefore, each new cell has a new DNA and an old fiber
 base peyaring ke niyam ke paalan se jo nayaa tantu banataa he, vah puraane tantu kii hoobahoo pratilipi hota he
 The DNA is made up of four basic bases: ek tantu kaa e duusare tantu ke tii ke saath, tathaa ek tantu kaa si duusare tantu ke ji ke saath hi judata he
 The filaments of one DNA complement the other
 atah yadi ek tantu kaa anukram pataa ho, to duusare kaa gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 There are hydrogen bonds between these two fibers, which connect the two bases

 Kano was very weak in his childhood, his stature was very low and his weight was not more than one hundred pounds even though he was twenty years old and he was often persecuted by the overbearing
 unhone 17 saal kii umr main us samay jujutsu kaa anusaran kiya jis samay yah kala khatm hone lagi thi lekin unhen isamen bahut kam kamyaabi hasil hui
 This was due in part to the difficulty of meeting a teacher who adopted him as a student
 18 saal kii umr main sahitya kii padhai karne ke liye vishvavidhyalay jane ke samay bhi unhone apane marshall art kaa adhyayan jari rakhaa or ant main unhone phukuda hachinosuke ke bare main suna jo tengin shin'yo-riyu ke guru or keico phukuda ke dada the, jo kaano kii ekmaatr jivit chaatra or duniya main sabase ooncha darja paane vaali mahila judoka he
 Fukuda Hachinosuke is said to have emphasized the technique of formal practice by sowing seeds of Kano's Gurucharan on free practice in Judo
 phukuda ke skool main kaano ke shaamil hone ke ek saal se kuch zyada samay bitne ke baad phukuda biimaar pad gaye or unki maut ho gai
 Kano then became a student of another Tenjin shin'yeo-ryu school of Iso Masatomo who emphasized the practice of pre-arranged methods more than Fukuda
 apane samarpan ke bal par kaano ne bahut jald nipun prashikshak kaa kitaab hasil kar liya or 21 saal kii umr main iso ke sahaayak prashikshak ban gaye
 Unfortunately, Iso soon fell ill and Kano adopted a different style, becoming a student of Ikubo Tsunetoshi of Kito-riu, realizing that he still had a lot to learn
 phukuda kii tarah, aikubo ne mukt abhyaas par zyada jor diya
 On the other hand, in kito-ryu, the emphasis was on the techniques of throwing to a much greater extent than in Tenjin shin'yeo-ryu
 is samay tak, kaano nai takneekon ko taiyaar karne main lage the, jaise - "sholder wheel" or "floating hip" daanv

 a major reform of jujutsu was planned in Kano's mind full of new ideas whose techniques were based on very good scientific principles and whose main aim was to develop the bravery of martial arts as well as the body, mind and character of the youth
 may 1882 main, 22 saal kii umr main, vishvavidhyalay main apni snaatak kii oopaadhi ke lagbhag khatm hone par, kaano ne aikubo ke skool ke nau chaatro ko kamakura ke eisho-ji naamak ek buddha mandir main jujutsu kaa prashikshan dena shuru kar diya or aikubo prashikshan main madad karne ke liye saptaah main teen din vahaan aate the

 For example, his opponent may move aside to attack the attacker and use his power to knock him forward
 Kano saw jujutsu as an incompatible bag of tricks that he wanted to unify according to a theory he found to be the solution to the notion of "maximum capacity"
 keval behatar takat par nirbhar karne vaale jujutsu kii takneekon ko pratidwandvi ke bal ko punarnirdeshit karne, pratidwandvi ke santulan ko bigaadane, yaa behatar uttolan kaa istemaal karne vaale ke paksh main sweekaar yaa asweekaar kar diya jaataa tha
 There are differences in the other symptoms of judo and jujutsu
 jahaan jujutsu kaa matlab komalta kii "kala", "vigyaan", yaa "takanic" he, vahiin judo kaa matlab komalta kaa "rasta" he
 The philosophical motive is hidden in the use of "dō", meaning road, road or path
 yah budo or bujutsu ke bich ke antar ke samaan he
 The use of this word has removed the idea of ancient martial arts whose sole purpose was to kill
 kaano ne judo ko shaareerik, maansik, bhaavnaatmak or naitik rup se khud par kaabo karne or khud kaa sudhaar karne ke ek saadhan ke rup main dekha
 unhone dainik jivan main adhiktam kshamta ke bhautik siddhant kaa bhi vistaar kiya or ise "paraspar samruddhi" main viksit kar diya
 In this regard, judo is seen as a holistic approach to extend life well outside the restrictions of the dojo
 judo ke abhyaasakarta ko judoka yaa "judo abhyaasakarta" ke naam se janaa jaataa he, haalanki paaramparik rup se keval chauthe dan yaa usase ooncha darja paane waalon ko "judoka" kaha jaataa tha
 When the -ka suffix is added to an English noun word, it means a person who specializes in that subject or who has special knowledge of that subject
 chauthe dan se neeche kaa darja paane vaale anya abhyaasakartaaon ko kencu-sei yaa "prashikshu" kaha jaataa tha
 In modern times judoka means a judo practitioner with any level of expertise
 judo shikshak ko senseyi kaha jaataa he
 The word sensei is derived from sen or saki and sei which means the person who came before you
 pashchimi dojo main, dan darje ke kisi bhi prashikshak ko senseyi kahana aam baat he
 Traditionally, that title has been reserved for fourth dan or higher instructors
 paaramparik rup se judo abhyaasakarta safed rang kii vardi pahante hai jise judogi kaha jaataa he jiskaa saamaanya matlab judo kaa abhyaas karne ke liye pahana jane vaala "judo poshaak" he
 Sometimes this word is shortened to only used as 'ge'
 judogi kaa nirmaan kaano ne 1907 main kiya tha or baad main isi tarah kii bardiyon ko kai anya marshall art dwaara apana liya gaya
 The modern Judogie is made of a white or blue cotton fabric with a traction lanyard and a matching white or blue cotton fabric quilt-stitched jacket that is fastened with a belt
 darje yaa pad ko suchit karne ke liye belt yaa kamarband ko aam taur par rang diya jaataa he
 The jacket is made with the intention that it can withstand the pressure of wrestling and hence it is made much thicker than a karate uniform
 judogi ko is tarah taiyaar kiya jaataa he ki is par pratidwandvi ko rokkar rakhane main aasaani ho jabaki karaategi ko barsaati kot banane vaali saamagree se banaaya jaataa he taaki pratidwandvi is saamagree par apni pakad na jamaa sake
 The first suggestion of the use of today's blue Judogie was made by Anton Geisink at the 1986 Maastricht IJF DC meeting
 pratiyogita ke liye, do main se ek pratiyogi ek nile rang kaa judogi pahentaa he taaki nyaayakartaaon, nirnayakartaaon or darshakon ko donon main antar karne main aasaani ho
 japan main, donon judoka ek safed rang ke judogi kaa istemaal karte hai or ek pratiyogi ke belt par paaramparik laal saish chipka diya jaataa he 
 japan ke baahar, naaballig pratiyogiyon kii pratiyogitaaon main suvidha ke liye ek rangeen saish kaa istemaal bhi kiya ja saktaa he, nile rang kaa judogi keval kshetreey yaa ucch stareey pratiyogitaaon ke liye jaruri hota he
 Japanese practitioners and purists despise the use of blue colored judogi
 jabaki judo main vibhinn prakaar ke paitaren, jaise - ludhakna, girnaa, phenkna, baith janaa, galaa ghontna, jodon ko ulajhaa dena or hamalaa karnaa, shaamil hai lekin khaas taur par throwing or groundwork par zyada dhyaan diya jaataa he
 The throwing technique is divided into a group of two types of techniques, one of which is - permanent technique and the other is - sacrifice techniques
 In addition permanent technique is divided into hand techniques, hip techniques and foot and leg techniques
 balidaan takanic ko those in which the thrower falls directly backwards or those in which he falls onto his side main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Ground fighting techniques are divided into attacks against the joints or joint locks, strangleholds or chokeholds and holding or pinning techniques
 judo main ek tarah kii mukkebaaji kaa abhyaas kiya jaataa he jise randori ke naam se janaa jaataa he jiskaa matlab "mukt abhyaas" he
 In Randori, two rivals can attack each other using any of Judo's slapping or grappling techniques
 kata main maarane kii takneekon, jaise - laat maarna or ghunsa maarna or saath hi saath chaaku or talwaar chalaane kii takneekon ko kaayam rakhaa gaya he
 This type of teaching is usually reserved for upper-class practitioners, but is prohibited in competition and is generally prohibited in Randori for safety considerations
 suraksha kii drushti se hi, umr or darje ke aadhaar par galaa ghontna, jodon ko ulajhaa dena or balidaan ke takneekon par pratibandh laga diya jaataa he
 For example, in the United States a person must be 13 or older to use a strangulation technique, and must be 16 or older to use an arm entanglement technique
 randori or khel-pratiyogita ke abhyaas main, jab ek pratidwandvi galaa ghontne yaa jodon ko uljhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he to doosraa pratidwandvi haar maan letaa he yaa use "maat" milti he or is tarah pratidwandvi ko do baar maat de dene se is baat kaa saafe sanket miltaa he ki vah pratidwandvi haar chukaa he
 When this happens, the match is over, and the outlawed player loses and is freed by a strangulation or joint manipulation technique
 kata ke rup hamalaa or bachaav kii purv vyavasthit paddatiyaan hai jiskaa abhyaas judo main judo kii takneekon main maharath hasil karne ke uddeshy se kisi saathi ke saath kiya jaataa he
 More specifically, their objectives include - explaining the basic principles of judo, demonstrating the correct use of the technique, teaching the philosophical principles on which judo is based, allowing the practice of the techniques to be used in competition Is not allowed and preserve those ancient techniques which are historically important but which are now contemporary Neither is not used in judo
 tarah-tarah ke kata kaa gyaan oonja darja paane ke liye jaruri he
 The seven spun recognized by Kodokan in today's times are as follows: kuch aise bhi kata hai jinhen kodocan dwaara aadhikarik rup se manyata nahin di gai he lekin unka abhyaas jari he
 The most prominent example of this is a spun called 'go no Sen no Kata', in which attention is paid to counter attack on the attempted attack
 judo main ek mukt shaileewale mukkebaaji ke abhyaas par jor diya jaataa he jise randori kaha jaataa he jo iske prashikshan ke mukhya roopon main se ek he
 Part of the time of the fight takes place in making the practice of boxing permanent which is called tachi-vaja and the rest of it is on the ground called ne-vaja
 mukkebaaji kaa abhyaas bhi suraksha ke niyamon ke anusaar hi kiya jaataa he jo apane aap keval takneekon kaa abhyaas karne se kahin adhik jeevant hota he jise pehle jujutsuka kiya karte the
 The use of full strength develops the muscles and cardiovascular system physically, and mentally develops strategy and reaction time, and helps the practitioner to learn how to use techniques against an opposing opponent
 judoka ke bich ek aam kahawat he, "judo kaa sabase acha prashikshan judo he
 " mukkebaaji ke abhyaas ke kai prakaar hai, jaise - ju renshu ; or kakaari geico In judo, there are two main stages of fighting: standing or standing phase, tachi-waza; And the ground phase, ne-vaja; Each stage requires its own techniques, strategies, randori, conditioning or adaptation, etc
 khai ko paatane ke liye "sankramanakalin" takneekon kaa vishesh prashikshan bhi diya jaataa he
 Judoka can be quite efficient in one phase and slightly weaker in the second stage depending on what interests them most, although most are balanced between the two
 judo main mukaable ke sthaayee or jamini donon charnon ke shaamil hone kii vajah se judoka ko apane sthaayee yaa khadey pratidwandvi ko neeche khinchne or uske baad use jameen par takalif dekar samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii kshamta milti he
 In the standing or standing phase, which takes precedence according to the rules of the competition, the contestants try to bang each other or use the technique of forcing the joints to stand up and strangle / choke / surrender while the rules According to this, it is much less in the standing or standing phase because it is more difficult to use these techniques while standing than in the banging
 Is taken
 haalanki kuch judoka apane pratidwandvi ko neeche giraane ke saath-saath samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii donon takneekon kaa ekasaath istemaal karne main kaaphi kushal hote hai jahaan samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii takanic kii shuruyaat khadey hone kii sthiti main hoti he or jameen par khatm hoti he
 However, it is prohibited to use the technique of manipulating joints
 neeche giraane kii takanic kaa mukhya uddeshy apane pairon par khadey, gatisheel avasthaa main khadey yaa khatarnaak sthiti main khadey pratidwandvi ko uske peeth ke bal jameen par patake dena he jahaan vah utana prabhavi bhang se harakat nahin kar saktaa he
 Thus, the main reason for dropping or being knocked down is to control the opponent and put himself in an effective position
 is tarah se abhyaasakarta ke paas ek nirnaayak parinaam prastut karne kii adhik kshamta hoti he
 Another reason for knocking down the opponent is to force his body into the ground by forcibly slapping him
 yadi pratidwandvi jabardast bhang se or puri tarah se kaabo karke apane pratidwandvi ko neeche giraata he to vah is aadhaar par spasht rup se vah match jeet saktaa he ki usne paryaapt shreshthata kaa pradarshan kiya he, kam prabhaavshaalee bhang se neeche giraane par kam ank diya jaataa he
 Points are awarded to a downed opponent only after standing and knocking down their opponent
 vaigyanik vishleshan or tark par kaano ke gurucharan ke saamanjasy ke saath, maanak kodocan judo adhyaapan nirdhaarit karata he ki neeche giraane kii koi bhi takanic saidhantik rup se chaar charnon vaali ek ghatana he: santulan bigaadna ; body positioning ; execution ; or ant main the finish or coup de grâce 
 prayek charan kaa anusaran pichley charan ke baad kaaphi teji se kiya jaataa he; adarshatah sabhi charnon kaa anusaran lagbhag ekasaath hota he
 Likewise, hitting techniques are not allowed to be used due to a higher chance of injury but the player has to "keep this technique in mind" during training, for example, a long bending fight
 Do not, because in this situation, one can easily be injured by attacking the knees or attacking elsewhere
 pratiyogita main, neeche giraane kii prakriya ke baad jameen par muqabla jari rah saktaa he yaa nahin to pratiyogi jameen par kanoonee taur par apni ladaai samaapt kar sakate hai; pratiyogi ko ne-waja kii shuruyaat karne ke liye bas yun hi jameen par girane kii ijaajat nahin di jaati he
 On the ground, the goal of the contestants is to either lower their opponent by strangling or strangling or entangling his arms or forcing him to surrender
 Hold downs, aatm-raksha, police kaa kaam or sainya hathonhaath muqabla karne ke liye mahatvapurn he kyonki jo vyakti apane pratidwandvi par kaabo kar letaa he vahi vyakti kaaphi aasaani se bachaav yaa hamalaa kar saktaa he
 In judo, if the attempt to hold down is maintained for twenty-five seconds, the person using this technique wins the match
 osakomi ke tahat apane pratidwandvi ko mukhya rup se uski peeth ke bal pakad kar neeche giraane kii koshish kii jaati he or yadi vah saamne yaa bagal main mud jaataa he to mat kaha jayega
 
 uske baad do judoka phir se khadey ho jaaenge or uske baad apana ladaai jari rakhenge yaa ladaai karte rahenge
 According to the rules established in 1905, the opponent was only required to hold his shoulder for two seconds — it is said that a samurai took the same amount of time to reach his knife or sword and defeat the opponent he was holding
 naveen adhik lambi aavashyaktaaen mukaable kii vaastaviktaa se sambandhit ho sakati hai ki senaanee, police adhikari, yaa sainik ko sthiti par niyantran sthapit karne ke liye paryaapt samay main apane pratidwandvi ko gatiheen kar dena chahie
 In judo, sometimes the holding technique can result in the opponent surrendering if the opponent does not have the ability to withstand that grip pressure, or the technique of forcing surrender to maintain the grip Ho
 iske alaava, yadi galaa ghontne yaa bhujaaon ko uljhane kii takanic judoka par baari pad jaae yaa judoka ko dard hone lage yaa chot lag jaae to vah samarpan kar saktaa he
 If a dropped person has wrapped his legs around the lower part of his opponent's body or part of the torso, he is also trying to make his opponent fall as much as his opponent would try him
 To fall down because his opponent cannot stand up and be free until his body is wrapped below a person does not leave him
 apane pratidwandvi ke ird-gird apane pairon ko lapete hue use upar se prabhavi rup se hamalaa karne main asamarth karne ke liye us par kaabo karte samay neeche vaala vyakti apane pratidwandvi par vibhinn akramanakari takneekon kaa istemaal kar saktaa he jisamen galaa ghontna, baajuon ko uljhaana or "body sizars" arthath 'sharir par dabaav daalkar saans lene main takalif paidaa karnaa' shaamil he
 In this condition, which is called "do-osa" in Japanese which means "trunk hold" meaning "to keep pressure on the torso", the person above is not able to control his opponent adequately due to this condition called Osakomi
 is
 upar vaala vyakti apane pratidwandvi ke pairon se bachakar nikalne kii koshish kar saktaa he or badale main use neeche giraane yaa samarpan karne par majaboor kar saktaa he yaa vah apane pratidwandvi ke guard ko todane or khadaa hone kii koshish kar saktaa he
 The person below may try to force his opponent to surrender with the help of his guarding technique or may try to roll over his opponent to climb
 joint lock arthath 'jodon ko uljhane kii takanic' ko aam taur par 'arm-lock' arthath 'bhujaaon ko uljhane kii takanic' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It is an effective combat technique because it allows a judoka to be able to control his opponent by inflicting pain on him or even breaking tangled joints when needed
 apane pratidwandvi ko samarpan karne par majaboor karne ke liye pratiyogita main lagbhag puri takat lagaakar kohni ke jodon ko uljhane kii takanic ke istemaal ko kaaphi surakshit mana jaataa he
 In the past, judo was allowed to entangle the legs, entangle the wrists, tangle the spine, and use a variety of other techniques that have been barred from the competition, taking into account the safety of the players
 yah nirnay liya gaya ki un jodon par hamalaa karne se khilaadiyon ko kai choton kaa saamana karnaa padegaa or isaki vajah se dhire-dhire un jodon kii haalat bigadati chali jaaegi
 phir bhi, kuch judoka abhi bhi anaupchaarik rup se in takneekon ko seekhney or inkaa istemaal karke ek duusare se ladane kaa majaa lete hai jo ki aupchaarik pratiyogitaaon main pratibandhit hai lekin isse sambandhit sambo, brazilian jiu-jitsu or jujutsu jaisi kalaon main abhi bhi inamen se kai takneekon kaa sakriyatapurvak istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Chokes and strangulations are commonly and commonly known as strangulation techniques
 isaki sahaayta se vyakti apane pratidwandvi ko behosh or yahaan tak ki maut kii neend sulaane ke liye galaa ghontne kii takanic kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 The use of strangulation technique causes the blood supply to the brain to be shut down due to pressure on the neck's cervical artery, while using the strangulation technique blocks the airway in front of the neck
 aam taur par in shabdon ko aksar ek duusare kii jagah istemaal kiya jaataa he or zyaadaatar judoka dwaara iske istemaal main aupchaarik rup se antar nahin kiya jaataa he
 In the competition, Judoka wins when his opponent surrenders or falls unconscious, as the opponent may become unconscious in just a few seconds if the strangling technique is used properly, but immediately thereafter There is usually no loss when freed
 ek purnataya vishesh marshall art ke saath-saath judo kaa vikaas ek khel ke rup main bhi hua he
 Judo was first seen in the Olympics at the 1932 Games held in Los Angeles where Kano and about 200 judo students performed
 tokio main yojit 1964 games main judo purushon kaa ek olympic khel ban gaya
 Juda also became an Olympic sport for women in 1988 due to the stubbornness of Rena Kanokogi, an American and many others

 In the 1940s Henry Stone and Yosh Uchida, Cal and SJSU head coaches, developed a weight class system, namely the weight class system, to be used in frequent competitions between schools
 1953 main, stone or uchida ne ek aadhikarik ghatak ke rup main apane wet class system ke saath, judo ko ek khel ke rup main sweekaar karne ke liye ameor athlettic union se ek safal vinati kii
 In 1961, Uchida represented the United States at the IJF meetings in Paris where the IJF adopted the weight class system for all future championships
 ijeef kaa nirmaan zyaadaatar shuruuaati european judo union ke aadhaar par kiya gaya tha jahaan kai saalon tak wet class system kaa bhi istemaal kiya tha
 There are currently seven weight divisions that can be changed by the governing bodies and can also be amended based on the age of the contestants: judo ke paramparaagat niyamon kaa makasad pratibhaagiyon ko chot lagane se bachaana or uchit shishtachar ko sunishchit karnaa he
 Some more rules were added to these rules to make the game more interesting for viewers
 match ke dauraan niskriy rahane yaa avaidh takneekon kaa istemaal karne ke liye dand diya ja saktaa he
 If a participant goes outside the scheduled area of the mat then the fight should be stopped
 yadi groundwork arthath ladaai ke dauraan nirnaayakon or nyaayakartaaon ko kuch vichaar-vimarsh karne kii jarurat padati he to nirnaayak sono-mamaa kahegaa or donon ko apni usee sthiti main ruuk janaa hoga
 When they are done, the judge says Yoshi and the match starts
 sabhi ank yaa dand, nirnaayak dwaara die jate hai
 Judges may take a decision to change the points or penalty awarded by the judge
 andhe logon ke judo kii suvidha ke liye ijeef niyamon main maamuli antar hota he
 The purpose of a judo match is to knock the opponent to the ground with his shoulders
 Fall mainly on the ground on his back; Or by strangling her, strangling or entangling her arms and forcing her to surrender
 inamen se kisi ek liye ank ke rup main ippon praapt hota he jiske baad turant match jeet liya jaataa he
 There are three grades or grades of scoring in judo: Ippon, vaja-ari and Yuko
 Ippon literally means "one point" from which the match is won
 teji se or takat lagaakar ek niyantrit tareeke se pratidwandvi ko zyaadaatar uski peeth ke bal jameen par patakane; paryaapt avadhi tak mat par apane pratidwandvi ko giraae rakhane; yaa pratidwandvi ko samarpan karne par majaboor kar dene ke liye ek ippon diya jaataa he
 Slamming the opponent to the ground with lack of sufficient power or control to be able to get Ippon; Or a vaja-ari is given to keep it on the ground for twenty seconds
 ek waja-ari kaa matlab aadha ank hota he or yadi to waja-ari praapt ho jaataa he to unase ek puraa ank ban jaataa he jo jeet hasil karne ke liye jaruri he
 Yuko is a lower scoring point and is counted as a 'tie-breaker' only; It is not combined with other Yuko numerals
 scoring, lexicographic hoti he; ek waja-ari, kisi bhi sankhya vaale yuko ko maat de detaa he, lekin ek waja-ari or ek yuko, yuko rahit waja-ari ko maat detaa he
 Keeping your opponent on the ground for fifteen seconds earns Yuko points
 yadi neeche giraae rakhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne vaale vyakti ko pehle hi ek waja-ari mil chukaa he, to do waja-ari ke jariye ippon ank praapt karne ke liye use apane pratidwandvi ko keval bees second tak jameen par giraae rakhane kii jarurat he
 With the lack of an Ippon or a vaja-ari points requirement, the opponent may receive a Yuko Point to land on the ground
 tathakthith "skilphul tekdouns" arthath "kushaltapurvak jameen par giraane" kii bhi ijaajat di jaati he lekin iske liye koi ank praapt nahin hota he
 If the total score is the same at the end of the match, then this problem is solved by the Golden Score rule
 golden score ek aakasmik maut vaali sthiti he jahaan match ke samay ke liye ghadi ko phir se set kiya jaataa he or is bich sabase pehle koi bhi ank paane vaala pratiyogi jeet jaataa he
 If no points are achieved during this period, the winner is determined by means of hantei i
e
 ‘the decisive and majority views of the two chief justices’
 judo ke scoreboard par prayek khilaadi dwaara praapt kiye gaye waja-ari or yuko kii sankhya ko dikhaaya jaataa he

 However, injuries can occur in many situations, such as - if the opponent on the ground jumps on the opponent after carelessly or intentionally banging, or if Tori is carelessly on the ground, ignoring Ukay's joints
 Slaps
 As the best way to prevent injury while being fired, students must be well practiced by sensei to properly use the technique of banging before entering the competition for which they "deserve"

 saanchaa:heteropolypeptide Hemoglobin or hemoglobin is a metalloprotein transporting iron-rich oxygen found in red blood cells of vertebrates and in the tissues of some indigens
 The hemoglobin in the blood transports oxygen from the lungs or gills to the rest of the body, where it releases oxygen for the use of cells
 stanpayiyon main laal rakt koshikaon ke shushk bhaag kaa kareeb 97% or kul bhaag kaa lagbhag 35% protein se bana hota he
 The oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin is between 1
36 and 1
37 ml O2 per gram of hemoglobin, which increases the total blood oxygen capacity by seventy times
 haemoglobin laal rakt koshikaon or unako utpann karne vaali progenitor rekhaon ke baahar bhi pai jaati he
 haemoglobin yukt anya koshikaon main sabstanshia nigra ke e9 dopaminargik neuron, macrofaij, alviyolar koshikaayen or gurdon kii mesangial koshikaayen shaamil hai
 in utakon main haemoglobin kii bhoomika oxygen ke parivahan kii jagah antioxident or louh chayapachay ke niyantrak ke rup main hoti he
 The oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin was discovered in 1840 by Hunfield
 In 1851 Otto Funk published a series of articles in which he described the growth of hemoglobin crystals by slow evaporation of a solution from a protein solution after diluting red blood cells with the help of solutions such as pure water, alcohol, or ether
 Told in haemoglobin ke prativarti oxikaran ke bare main felics haap-sealler dwaara kuch or varshon ke baad bataaya gaya

 is uplabdhi ke liye unhen jon kendru ke saath 1962 kaa rasayanashastra main nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 The role of hemoglobin in blood is described by physiologist Claude Bernard
 The name hemoglobin is derived from the combination of the terms heme and globin, suggesting that each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein in the heme group
 Each heme group has one iron atom, which can bind an oxygen molecule through ion-induced forces
 The most common hemoglobin of mammals consists of four such subunits
 haemoglobin main adhiktar protein hota he or ye protein amino acidon kii shrinkhalaaon se bane hote hai
 ye shrinkhlaayein raikhik rup main hoti hai, jaise kisi likhe gaye vaakya main akshar hote hai yaa maala main moti lage hote hai
 sabhi proteinon main aminon acidon kii protein shrinkhalaa main amino acidon ke prakaaron main vibhinnata us protein ke rasaynic gunon or kaary ko nishchit karti he
 yahi baat haemoglobin par bhi lagu hoti he, jisamen amino acidon kii shrinkhalaa oxygen ke prati protein ke aakarshan jaise mahatvapurn kaaryon ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 The amino acid chains of globin proteins in hemoglobins differ among different species, although variations increase with the distance of development between species
 For example, the most common hemoglobin chains in humans and chimpanzees are similar, while this same chain differs from the most common amino acid chain of guerrillas by only one amino acid in the alpha and beta globin protein chains
 These differences are more in castes with less affinity
 Like proteins other than hemoglobin, differences in DNA chains between species are greater than differences in the amino acid chains they coded, as different DNA chains may point to the same amino acid
 kisi ek jati main bhi, haemoglobin ke vibhinn prakaar hameshaa maujuud hote hai, haalanki har jati main koi ek shrinkhalaa saamanytah sabase adhik pai jaati he
 haemoglobin protein kii jeenon kii vikrutiyon ke kaaran haemoglobin ke vibhinnatayukta prakaar utpann hote hai

 lekin kuch vikrut haemoglobinon ke kaaran haemoglobinopathys naamak anuvanshik rogon ke ek samooh kii utpatti hoti he

 in sabhi rogon main raktaalpata hoti he
 Like other proteins, chains of hemoglobin's amino acids can be adaptive
 For example, recent studies have shown how deer mice living in the mountains survive the thin air found at heights with the help of their different gene types
 a researcher at the University of nebraska-lincoln found malformations in four different genes that are thought to be responsible for the differences between deer mice living in low-lying areas and mountains
 Examining wild bees captured from the mountains and lowlands, it was found that the genes of both breeds were identical, except for those that control their hemoglobin's oxygen-carrying capacity
 The genetic variation of mountain rodents gives them the ability to use oxygen much better, because it is available in small quantities at high places like mountains
 haemoglobin kaa sanshleshan ek jatil sopan shrinkhalaa main hota he

 stanpayiyon main kendrak ke na hone par bhi, bachaa hua rebosomal arene haemoglobin kaa tab tak utpaadan karata he, jab tak ki rakt pravaah main pravesh karne ke baad reticulosite kaa arene samaapt nahin ho jaataa

 Hemoglobin exhibits properties of both tertiary and quartile compositions of proteins
 Most of the amino acids of hemoglobin form alpha holics that are attached to small ahalic segments
 Hydrogen bonds stabilize helical sections within this protein, causing attraction within the molecule, and each polypeptide chain is twisted into a characteristic shape
 The quaternary structure of hemoglobin is due to its four subunits located in the tetrahedral system
 adhikansh manushyon main haemoglobin anu chaar globulaar protein upikaiyon kaa ek samooh hota he
 prayek upikai ek gaiyr-protein hime samooh se kas kar judi ek protein shrinkhalaa se bani hoti he
 prayek protein shrinkhalaa ek globin fold vyavastha main aapas main jude alpha-heliks rachanaatmak khandon ke set ke rup main vyavasthit hoti he, kyonki mayoglobin jaise anya hime / globin proteinon main isi folding motiff jaisi vyavastha hoti he
 is folding pattern main ek sthaan hota he, jo hime samooh ko majbootee se pakade rakhata he
 The heme group contains an iron ion that resides in a heterocyclic ring, called porphyrin
 This porphyrin ring consists of four pyrrole molecules, which are connected in a circle to the iron ion at the center
 The iron ion, which is the location of the oxygen bond, works together with four nitrogens living in the same plane at the center of the ring
 The iron is strongly attached to the globular protein via the imidazole ring of the F8 histidine residue located below the porphyrin ring
 a sixth space can reversibly bind oxygen by a cordinate covalent bond, thus completing the octahedral group of six ligands
 Oxygen binds in an end-on bent geometry, where the oxygen atom is bound to iron and the other exits at an angle
 When oxygen is not bound, a water molecule with a weak bond fills that space, yadhyapi carbon daai oxide kaa parivahan haemoglobin dwaara hota he, yah louh-bandhak sthanon ke liye oxygen se spardhaa nahin karata, balki vastav main rachana kii protein shrinkhalaaon se judaa hota he
 The iron ion can be in the Fe2 + or Fe3 + state, but the ferrihemoglobin cannot bind oxygen
 Oxygen in the binding is temporarily and reversibly oxidized to CO, while oxygen is temporarily converted to superoxide
 In this way, iron has to be in the oxidation state to bind oxygen
 If the superoxide anion corresponding to Fe3 + is protonated, the hemoglobin iron remains oxidized and unable to bind oxygen
 In such a situation the enzyme methemoglobin reductase may eventually reactivate methemoglobin by decreasing the iron center

 Broadly speaking, hemoglobin can be saturated or unsaturated with oxygen molecules
 Oxyhemoglobin originates during physiological respiration when the heme portion of the protein hemoglobin in red blood cells binds to oxygen
 This process occurs in the pulmonary capillaries located near the alveoli in the lungs
 Oxygen then reaches the cells through the bloodstream where it is used for the hydrolysis of hydrolytic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the formation of ATP
 But it is not helpful in preventing blood ph deficiency
 Respiration can reverse this situation by removing carbon dioxide, which increases the ph back

 The oxidation state of oxidized hemoglobin is difficult to determine because oxyhemoglobin is diagenetic by experimental measurements, yet low-energy electron structures in both oxygen and iron are paramagnetic
 The following are the minimum-energy types of oxygen and related iron oxidation conditions: ye sabhi sanrachanaayen diamagnetic na hokar, paramagnetic hoti hai
 is tarah, dekhe gaye diamagnetismo or ayugal electranon ko samajhane ke liye louh or oxygen ke sanyog main electrunon kaa ek asahaj vitaran hona jaruri he
 There are three possibilities for the production of diamagnetic HB-OTO: sidhi prayogic jaankaree In this way, the closest formal state of iron in HB-OTO is the oxidation +3 state, with oxygen in the -1 state
 The diatomagnetism in this structure arises from the single unpaired electrons on the superoxide being arranged in a counter-magnetogenetically manner from the single unpaired electrons on the iron, which, according to the diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin of the experiment, does not yield any total spin
 diamagnetic oxihemoglobin ke liye upar di gai teen sambhaavnaaon main se duusari kaa prayog dwaara sahi paaya janaa aashcharyapurna nahin he– singlate oxygen or charge ke bade vibhaajan donon pratikul ucch-urja dashaaen hai

 According to preliminary theories presented by bio-inorganic chemists, prospect no
 1 was correct and the oxidation condition to iron II
 Should be in This was thought to be because iron's oxidation state in the form of methemoglobin III, when superoxide is not present to "hold" the 
o2-electron, makes hemoglobin inefficient to bind the normal triplet O2 in the air
 Therefore it is assumed that when oxygen gas is bound in the lungs, iron remains in the form of Fe
 The chemistry of iron in this earlier classic model was intriguing, but the need for a diagenetic high-energy singlet oxygen was never understood
 It was argued that the bonding of the oxygen molecule to the high spin iron placed in an octahedral region of strong-field ligands
 Gives - this change in area causes the energy to be divided by an increase in the crystal area, Thereby forming iron-electron pairs to form low-spin structures, which are diamagnetic in Fe
 This forced low-spin pairing occurs on oxygen binding, but is not sufficient to explain the change in iron size
 In order to understand the small size and increased oxidation state of iron, and the weak oxygen bond, it is necessary to remove an extra electron from the iron by oxygen
 yah dhyaan main rakhana chaiye ki purna-sankhya oxikaran dasha kaa nirdhaaran ek aupchaarikavaad he, kyonki purna electron-antaran main doshahin band kramon ke liye kovalent baandon kaa hona aavashyak nahin he

 lekin Fe kii apeksha echbi-otu main louh kaa model kaa Fe hona adhik sahi lagata he
 In addition to the oxygen ligand, which cooperatively binds hemoglobin, hemoglobin ligands also contain competitive inhibitors such as carbon monoxide and allosteric ligands such as carbon dioxide

 In this way, in the tetrameric type of normal adult hemoglobin, oxygen binding is a cooperative process
 The affinity of hemoglobin binding to oxygen is increased by the oxygen saturation of the molecule - the previously bound oxygen affects the size of the binding sites for the next oxygen in such a way that they are optimized for binding
 This positive cooperative binding process is made possible by the stearic changes of the hemoglobin protein complex discussed above, that is, when a subunit protein of hemoglobin is oxygenated, a change is initiated in the whole complex, increasing the affinity for oxygen in other subunits
 is
 As a result, the oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin is Sigma, or S-shaped, while the normal curve related to the non-binding bond is hyperpolarized

 Similarly, hemoglobin also has a competitive binding affinity to sulfides including cyanide, sulfur monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen sulfide
 All of these bind to the iron in the heme without changing its oxidation state, but block the oxygen bond, causing severe toxicity

 Carbon dioxide is located at a different binding site on hemoglobin
 Carbon dioxide easily dissolves in oxygen-free blood, which can easily remove carbon dioxide from the body after oxygen has reached the metabolic tissues
 This attraction of venous blood to carbon dioxide is called the Halden effect
 Through the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, carbon dioxide reacts with water to give carbonic acid, which is decomposed into bicarbonate and protons - is tarah ucch carbon daai oxide vaala rakt kam piech vaala hota he

 a study was carried out to see the effect of hemoglobin type on the partitioning of volatile organic compounds in the breath in the blood
 In this research, benzene was used as a sample VOC for testing, as its properties are similar to many other vocs
 This study compared the effect of water solubility of Hb on the partition coagulation of vocs with the effect of other species or types of hemoglobin
 Various blood used include human hemoglobin
 Rat Hb has very little water and is in a semi-crystalline form in red blood cells, meaning it is more hydrophobic than water-soluble human blood
 Sickle cell hemoglobin is soluble in water, but it can be insoluble in water and converted to hydrophobic polymers when deoxygenated

 In the fetus - shishu main - In adults - rog utpann karne vaale prakaar - When red cells reach the end of their lives due to age or disorders, they burst, the hemoglobin molecule splits and iron is reused
 When the porphyrin ring disintegrates, its residues are normally secreted into the bile by the liver
 This process also produces one carbon monoxide molecule for every molecule of heme
 It is one of the few sources of carbon monoxide production in the human body and is responsible for the normal blood levels of carbon monoxide even in people breathing pure air
 The second main product of heme weathering is bilirubin
 If red blood cells are getting destroyed faster than normal, increased levels of this chemical can be found in the blood

 To a lesser extent, hemoglobin a is slowly combined with glucose at the valene terminal of each beta chain
 The molecule obtained is often called hba1c
 As the amount of glucose in the blood increases, the percentage of hba changing to hba1c also increases
 Diabetes patients who have high glucose levels also have higher hba1c
 The percentage of hba1c represents the average of the level of glucose in the blood over a longer period of time as the rate of hba is combined with glucose

 Therefore, there is an ongoing struggle between habitats and animals for food

 But this does not happen
