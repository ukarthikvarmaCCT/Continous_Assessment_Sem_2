 Protective tariffs have historically been used as a measure against this possibility
 haalanki, sangrakshnatmak teriffon se nuksaan bhi hota he
 Most notable is that they inhibit the price of goods subject to tariffs by weakening local competition, causing losses to consumers or manufacturers of the goods who use the goods to produce something different: for example, Food tariffs can increase poverty, while tariffs on steel or steel may make automobile manufacturers less competitive
 ve ulti pratikriya bhi kar sakate hai agar tarriff se nuksaan hone vaale vyapaar ko karne vaale desh khud par hi tarriff lagaate hai jiske parinamswaroop vyapaar yuddh shuru ho jaataa he or, mukt vyapaar siddhantkaron ke anusaar, donon pakshon ko nuksaan uthaanaa padataa he

 is vakrarekha se ek purvanumaan miltaa he ki maal yaa seva kii antarrashtriya aapurti puri tarah se namya he or yah bhi ki duniya main bataai gai keemat par ek najdiki anant maatra main utpaadan ho saktaa he
 Obviously, in real-world situations, this is somewhat impractical or unrealistic, but making such predictions is unlikely to have any material impact on the model's outcome
 is maamle main maal kii antarrashtriya keemat 50 dollar he 
 The above model is completely accurate only in extreme situations where none belongs to the consumer group and the cost of the product is a fraction of their salary
 agar iske bajaay, ham vipareet charam sthiti ko lete hai or maan lete hai ki sabhi upabhokta nirmaataa samooh se sambandhit hai or yah bhi maan lete hai ki unki ekmaatr kharidari shakti vetan se sambandhit he jo utpaadan ke rup main praapt hota he or utpaada kii laagat unka puraa vetan he, to graph ekadam alag dikhaai detaa he
 Without tariffs, only producers or manufacturers / consumers capable of producing the product at world price would have enough money to buy it at that price

 tarriff ke saath, ek bada sidiel trikon or uskaa darpan batch paaegaa
 Also note that there is no incentive to buy imported goods over domestic, with tariffs or without tariffs, as each has the same price
 keval rin ke madhyam se, parisampattiyon ko bechakar, yaa nai tarah kii gharelu utpaadan se nae vetan ke madhyam se uplabdh kharidne kii shakti main pherbadal karke aaayaatit maal ko karidaa jayega
 yaa, jaahir he, agar isaki keemat keval mazdooree yaa vetan kaa ek ansh ho
 In the real world, as more imported goods replace domestic goods, they consume a much larger fraction of the available domestic salaries, leading the graph to move towards this approach of the model
 agar utpaadan ke nae tareeke samay par na mili, to desh diwalia ho jayega or aatanrik raajnneetik dabaav ke falswaroop rin kaa bhugtan nahin ho paaegaa, bahut zyada tarriff lagegaa, yaa usase bhi badtar haalat ho jaaegi
 The establishment of tariffs slows down this process, allowing more time for new types of production to develop, but it also strengthens industries that may never regain competitive pricing
 tarriff ko ek swatantra raashtra kii sthapana karne ke liye ek raajnneetik upkaran ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye, sanyukt rajya america kaa tarriff act of 1789 arthath prashulk adhinium 1789, jis par vishesh rup se 4 july ko hastakshar kiya gaya tha, ko akhbaaron ne "second dikaleyareshan of independence" arthath 'swatantraaa kii duusari ghoshnaa' kaha kyonki iskaa makasad saarvbhaumik or swatantra sanyukt rajya america ke raajnneetik lakshya kii prapti ke liye ek aarthik saadhan bananaa tha
 In modern times, the political impact of tariffs is seen in a positive and negative sense

 Mahavir Tyagi was born in Dhabarsi in Moradabad district
 meerut main padhai puri karne ke baad unhone angreji fouj jwoin kar lee or unki niyukti percia yani iran main kar di gai
 But after the Jallianwala Bagh scandal, the tide of hatred against the British arose in the country that Mahavir Tyagi also resigned from the army's job, the army court martialed him, after that he along with Gandhiji in the freedom movement of the country Jumped
 angrejon dwaara wo 11 baar giraftaar kiye gaye, ek kisaan andolan ke dauraan jab unako giraftaar karke yatnaaen di gayi to gandhiji ne iske liye angrejon kii aalochana yang india main lekh likhakar kii
 Although the reason for such torture at that time was the personal displeasure of one of the British magistrates, who had imposed a case of treason on him and was trying to eliminate Mahavir Tyagi's airs, but Mahavir Tyagi, a military officer Neither bowing down was agreeable nor apologizing

 Jawaharlal Nehru made a statement in Parliament that, even in Aksai Chin, grass does not grow as much as a straw, it is a barren area
 darasal, un dinon aksai chin china ke kabje main chale jane ko lekar vipaksh ne hangaamaa kaat rakhaa tha
 But Nehru did not expect that the biggest face of his opposition would be his own cabinet, that of Mahavir Tyagi, an officer of the English army, who resigned to become a freedom fighter and became a minister after the country became independent
 idhar, bhari sansad main mahavir tyaagi ne apana ganja sar nehru ko dikhaaya or kaha, yahaan bhi kuch nahin ugta to kya main ise katwa duun yaa phir kisi or ko de duun
 Think what would have happened to Nehru after listening to this answer, who needs the opposition if they are such ministers
 lekin mahavir tyaagi ne ye sabit kar diya ki wo vyakti puja ke bajaay desh kii puja ko mahatv dete the

 Later, the British government also distanced itself from the case
 wo magistrate buland shahar kaa tha or tyaagi kii pakad us vakt pashchimi uttar pradesh ke kai jilon main kaaphi tagdi thi
 Due to his tension with the magistrate and the atrocities that occurred, not only did the public feel good with him, but he came directly in the eyes of the big Congress veterans
 1921 main gandhi ne unako lekar apni aawaaj uthaai
 Tyagi was arrested while addressing a gathering of four thousand people in the city of Buland at that time
 jail main hi unki mulaakaat pandit motilal nehru se hui or jab ek baar baap-bete ke bich koi galatfahami hui to wo mahavir tyaagi ne hi dur kii thi

 Despite being in electoral politics, Mahavir's relations with anti-congress revolutionaries were also the closest to him, Sachindra Nath Sanyal, whose organization led the revolutionaries like Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh, Batukeshwar Dutt and Sukhdev in the Hindustan Republican Association
 desh kii aazaadee ke baad wo loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye or nehru kebinet main unhen ministar of revenue and expendichar banaaya gaya or sabase dilachasp he is pad par rahete unki ek khaas uplabdhi

 tyaagi hi wo pehle vyakti the, jisane dhara 356 lagane par kerala kii ies namburapad kii sarkaar giraane kaa virodh kiya tha
 That statement to Tyagi was also very much discussed, in which he said that if the Congress falls into the politics of caste or sect, then it will dig its own grave
 baad main tyaagi ko paanchave finance kamishan kaa adhyaksh bhi banaaya gaya, vitt or arthvyavastha ke kshetra main unhone kai sudhaar kiye

 Vande Mataram was second in the top 10 songs in the poll
 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 When he wrote a Bengali novel called Anand Math in 1882, then he also included this song in the love of the motherland

 In all these latter terms, the motherland is praised as Durga

 It is said that he wrote this song on the train while coming to Naihati from Sealdah
 bengal main chale swadhinata-aandolan ke dauraan vibhinn reliyon main josh bharne ke liye yah geet gaaya jane laga
 Gradually this song became highly popular among the people
 british sarkaar isaki lokapriyata se bhayakrant ho uthi or usne is par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur sang this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1896

 swadhinata sangram main is geet kii nirnaayak bhagidaari ke baavjood jab raashtragan ke chayan kii baat aayi to vande maataram ke sthaan par rabindranath thakur dwaara likhe va gaaye gayi geet jan gana man ko variyata di gayi
 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved

 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
 kya kisi ko koi geet gane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin? yah prashn sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh bijoy emmanuele varses kerala rajya naam ke ek vaad main uthaaya gaya
 In this suit, some students were expelled from school because they refused to sing the national anthem Jana Gana Mana
 yah vidhyaarthee skool main raashtragan ke samay iske sammaan main khadey hote the tathaa iskaa sammaan karte the par geet ko gaate nahin the
 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

 From the human point of view, there are three aspects to a problem, also called dimension or dimension - top-down, forward-backward and right-left
 "dik" ko angrezi main "spes", farsi main "phiza", sindhi main "polar", unani main "khoross" or german main "roum" kehete hai
 "dimension" is referred to as "demotion" in English and three dimensional as "three-dimensional"
 "aapekshik" ko angrezi main "ralative" kehete hai
 The relative position of any two objects present in a problem with such three aspects can be told on these three aspects
 ham kah sakate hai ke pehali vastu duusari vastu se 10 meter upar, 4 meter aage or 6 meter daayen par sthit he
 In the same way, in two-dimensional problem, the relative position of two objects from only two dimensions is detected

 lekin agar ve aeuclidi dik main khinchi ja raheen hai jo swayan hi muda hua he to unamem aapas kaa faaslaa badal saktaa he or ve mil bhi saktin hai
 The Earth's surface is a two-dimension acuclidi problem
 isapar agar equater par uttar kii ore do samanaantar rekhaayen banaai jaaen to ve donon ek dusre ke nazadik aati jaayengi or uttari dhruv par ja kar mil jaayengi
 In the same way, we can also tell about the relative motion of two objects located in a problem
 agar ham zamin se do aatishbaaziyaan aasmaan kii ore udaayen to alag alag vastuon kii tulana kar ke aisi chizein kah sakate hai - It may also happen that the green fireworks continue to climb in the sky, but the red fireworks start moving diagonally from 30 km north and 20 km above
 ab ham or hari aatishbaazi vaala vyakti yah kahenge - If the red fireworks could move to the northeast, it can be seen that in this three-dimensional problem, the speed and direction of any two objects with three dimensions can be fully told

 unhone bharat kii puranic kathaon or darshan ko aadhaar banaakar rachanaaen kii or unki rachanaaon main bhartiya jivan or darshan ke vividh rup or mul tatva nirupit hai
 Kalidas is considered a poet who gives voice to the overall national consciousness of the nation due to these characteristics and some scholars even place him as a national poet
 abhigyanshakuntalam kalidas kii sabase prasiddh rachana he
 The play is one of the few Indian literary works first translated into European languages
 yah puure vishwa sahitya main agraganya rachana maani jaati he
 Meghdootam is the best work of Kalidasa in which the poet's imagination and expressiveism, the power of expression, is at its best and the amazing humanization of nature is seen in Khandakavya
 kalidas vaidarbhi reeti ke kavi hai or tadnurup ve apni alankaar yukt kintu saral or madhur bhashaa ke liye vishesh rup se jane jate hai

 sahitya main audaarya gun ke prati kalidas kaa vishesh prem he or unhone apane shringaar ras pradhan sahitya main bhi adarshavaadi parampara or naitik mulyon kaa samuchit dhyaan rakhaa he
 Kalidasa's later poet Banabhatta has particularly praised her words
 kalidas kis kaal main hue or ve multah kis sthaan ke the isamen kaafii vivaad he
 Since Kalidasa wrote the play Malavikagnimitram by making the second Sunga ruler Agnimitra a hero and Agnimitra ruled in 170 BC, there is a limit to the time of Kalidasa that they could not have happened before
 chhathin sadi isvi main banbhatta ne apni rachana harshcharitam main kalidas kaa ullekh kiya he tathaa isi kaal ke pulakeshin dwitiya ke ehole abhilekh main kalidas kaa zikr he atah ve inke baad ke nahin ho sakate
 Thus Kalidasa is scheduled to be between the first century BCE to the sixth century AD
 durbhagyavash is samay seemaa ke andar ve kab hue is par kaafii matbhed hai
 Among the scholars, the second century BCE vote, the first century BC, the third century AD, the fourth century AD, the fifth century AD, and the sixth century AD; Were prevalent
 inamen zyaadaatar khandit ho chuke hai yaa unhen maanane vaale ikke dukke log hai kintu mukhya sangharsh 'pratham shatabdi isa purv kaa mat or 'chaturth shatabdi isvi kaa mat' main he
 First century BC opinion - parampara ke anusaar kalidas ujjayini ke un raja vikramaditya ke samakaleen hai jinhone isa se 57 varsh purv vikram sanwat chalaaya
 The change in the name of Vikramorvashiyya's hero Pururava to Vikrama reinforces the argument that Kalidasa was the royal court poet of King Vikramaditya of Ujjayini
 inhen vikramaditya ke navratnon main se ek mana jaataa he
 Fourth Century AD - pro kith or anya itihaaskaar kalidas ko gupt shaasha chandragupta vikramaditya or unke uttaradhikari kumargupta se jodate hai, jinka shasankaal chauthi shatabdi main tha
 It is believed that Chandragupta II took the title of Vikramaditya and his reign is considered to be the golden age
 vivaad or paksh-pratipaksh - There is also controversy about the birthplace of Kalidasa
 meghdutam main ujjain ke prati unki vishesh prem ko dekhte hue kuch log unhen ujjain kaa nivasee maanate hai
 Writers have also tried to prove that Kalidas was born in Kaviltha village in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand
 kalidas ne yaheen apni praarambhik shiksha grahan kii thi auki yaheen par unhone meghdoot, kumarasambhav auki raghuvansh jaise mahakavyon kii rachana kii thi
 Kaviltha is located in Guptkashi on the Chardham Yatra route
 guptkashi se kalimath siddhapitha vaale raste main kalimath mandir se chaar kilometre aage kaviltha gaanv sthit he
 In Kaviltha, the government has also established an auditorium by installing a statue of Kalidas
 jahaan par har saal june maah main teen dinon tak goshtee kaa aayojan hota he, jisamen deshbhar ke vidwaan bhaag lete hai
 Some scholars have even tried to prove them of Bengal and Orissa
 kehete hai ki kalidas kii srilanka main hatya kar di gai thi lekin vidwaan ise bhi kapol-kalpit maanate hai
 According to legends and legend, Kalidas was beautiful from shaklo-surat and was one of the Navratnas of Vikramaditya's court
 kaha jaataa he ki praarambhik jivan main kalidas anpadh or murkh the
 Kalidas is married to a princess named Vidyottama
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki vidyottama ne pratigya kii thi ki jo koi use shastrarth main haraa degaa, vah usee ke saath shaadi karegi
 When Vidyottama defeated all the scholars in the debate, saddened by the insult, some scholars got Kalidasa to debate him
 vidyottama maun shabdaawalee main gudh prashn puuchhati thi, jise kalidas apni buddhi se maun sanketon se hi jawaab de dete the
 Vidyottama felt that Kalidas was giving a deep answer to the esoteric question
 udhaaharan ke liye vidyottama ne prashn ke rup main khulaa haath dikhaaya to kalidas ko laga ki yah thappad maarane kii dhamkee de rahi he
 In response to this, Kalidasa showed a punch, Vidyottama felt that he is saying that even though the five senses are different, all are governed by one mind
 vidyottama or kalidas kaa vivaah ho gaya tab vidyottama ko sachai kaa pataa chalaa ki kalidas anpadh hai
 He cursed Kalidas and drove him out of the house saying that he would not return home without becoming a true Pandit
 kalidas ne sachche man se kaali devi kii aradhana kii or unke aashirwad se ve gyani or dhanwaan ban gaye
 When he returned home after gaining knowledge, he knocked on the door and said - Kapatam Udghatya Sundari
 vidyottama ne chakit hokar kaha -- asti kashchid vagvisheshah 
 Thus, according to this legend, Kalidasa considered Vidyottama as his pioneer master and gave this sentence a place in his poetry
 kumarasambhavam kaa prarambh hota he- astyuttarasyam dishi


 se, meghdutam kaa pehla shabd he- kashchitkanta


 or raghuvansham kii shuruyaat hoti he- vagarthviv

 There are about forty compositions, small and big, which different scholars have tried to prove to be composed by Kalidasa
 inamen se maatr saat hi aisi hai jo nirvivaad rup se kalidaskrut mani jaati hai: teen naatak: abhigyaan shaakuntalam, vicramorvasium or malvicagnimitram; do mahakavy: raghuvansham or kumarasambhavam; or do khandakavy: meghdutam or rutusanhaar
 Even among these, Prof

 bhagini nivedita kaa mul naam 'margaret elizabeth nobul' tha
 She was an english-irish social worker, writer, teacher and disciple of Swami Vivekananda
 bharat main aaj bhi jin videshiyon par garv kiya jaataa he unamem bhagini nivedita kaa naam pehali pankti main aata he, jinhone na keval bharat kii aazaadee kii ladaai ladane vaale deshbhakton kii khuleam madad kii balki mahila shiksha ke kshetra main bhi mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 Bhagini Nivedita was introduced to India through Swami Vivekananda
 swami vivekananda ke aakarshak vyaktitv, nirhankaari swabhaav or bhaashan style se vah itnaa prabhavit huin ki unhone na keval ramakrishna paramhans ke is mahaan shishy ko apana aadhyatmik guru bana liya balki bharat ko apni karmbhumi bhi banaaya
 Margaret Elizabeth Nobel was born on 28 October 1867 in Ireland
 praarambhik jivan main unhone kala or sangeet kaa acha gyaan hasil kiya
 Nobel adopted the education sector as a profession
 nobel ke jivan main nirnaayak mode 1895 main us samay aayaa jab landan main unki swami vivekanand se mulaakaat hui
 Swami Vivekananda's sublime attitude, heroic behavior and affection has completely enshrined Nivedita's mind that India is her real work place
 iske teen saal baad vah bharat aa gayi or bhagini nivedita ke naam se pahachaani gayi
 Swami Vivekananda gave Nobel initiation on 25 March 1898 and inspired him to walk the path of compassion towards Lord Buddha
 diksha dete hue swami vivekanand ne apane preranaprad shabdon main unase kaha- jaao or us mahaan vyakti kaa anusaran karo jisane 500 baar janm lekar apana jivan lokkalyaan ke liye samarpit kiya or phir buddhatv praapt kiya
 At the time of initiation, Swami Vivekananda gave her new name Nivedita and later she became famous by the same name throughout the country
 bhagini nivedita kuch samay apane guru swami vivekanand ke saath bharat bhraman karne ke baad antat: kalakatta main bas gayi
 With the inspiration of his mentor, he opened a school for girls in Calcutta
 nivedita skool kaa udghaatan ramakrishna paramhans kii jeevansangini maa sharada ne kiya tha
 Mother Sharda always gave affection to Bhagini Nivedita as her daughter and always encouraged her efforts in girl child education
 banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main bangla vibhaag ke purv adhyaksh amarnath ganguli ne kaha ki margaret nobel ko swami vivekanand ne nivedita naam diya tha
 It can have two meanings: a woman who has laid down her life at the feet of her guru, while the other meaning is more right on Nivedita, a woman who has given her life for female education
 ganguli ne kaha ki sistar nivedita main ek aag thi or swami vivekanand ne us aag ko pahachaanaa
 Nivedita entered the field of female education with the inspiration of her mentor at a time when even the elite people of the society did not like to send their girls to school
 aise samaaj main stri shiksha ko badhaava dena nivedita jaisi jeevat mahila ke prayaason se hi sambhav ho sakaa
 During the stay in Calcutta, all the prominent people of that era came in contact with Bhagini Nivedita
 unke saath sampark rakhane vaale pramukh logon main gurudev rabindranath tagore, vaigyanik jagadish chandra basu, shilpkaar hamel tathaa avanindranath thakur or chitrakaar nandlaal bose shaamil hai
 He inspired Ramesh Chandra Dutt and Yadunath Sarkar to write history from an Indian perspective
 ganguli ne sistar nivedita ke deshprem kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki irish hone ke kaaran swatantraaa prem unke rakt main tha
 In such a situation, it was quite natural that he supported and supported the freedom fighters and revolutionaries in India
 bharat premi bhagini nivedita durgapuja kii chhuttiyon main bhraman ke liye darjeeling gai thim
 But there his health deteriorated and finally he died on 13 October 1911 at the age of 44
