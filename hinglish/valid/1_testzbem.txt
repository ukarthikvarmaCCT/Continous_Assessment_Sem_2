lagbhag pachaas saal tak raajnneeti main sakriy rahe ramswaroop verma ko raajnneeti kaa 'kabir' kaha jaataa he
 He was a close associate of Dr
 Ram Manohar Lohia and his ideological friend and famous finance minister of the Government of Uttar Pradesh in 1967, who then surprised the entire financial world by presenting a budget of 20 crores profit
 unka saarvajanik jivan sadaiv nishkalank, nidar, nishpaksh or vyapak janhiton ko samarpit rahaa
 The dignities and norms he established in politics and those he himself lived for will always be respected and remembered
 22 agast 1923 ko kanpur ke gram gaurikaran ke ek kisaan parivaar main janmen ramswaroop ne raajnneeti ko apane karmkshetra ke rup main chaatr jivan main hi chun liya tha baavjood iske ki chaatr raajnneeti main unhone kabhi hissaa nahin liya
 He got his early education in Kalpi and Pukhrayan from where he passed the high school and inter examinations in the higher division
 verma ji sadaiv medhaavi chaatr rahe or swabhaav se atyant saumy, vinamr, milansaar the par aatmasmman or swabhimaan unke vyaktitv main kuta-kuta kar bharaa hua tha
 He received his MA in Hindi at Allahabad University in 1949 and a law degree thereafter
 unhone bhartiya prashasnic seva kii pariksha bhi uteern kii or itihaas main sarvocch ank paye jabaki padhai main itihaas unka vishay nahin rahaa
 But did not attend the interview due to his determination not to do the job
 inke pita kaa naam vanshagopal tha
 Varma was the youngest of his four brothers
 anya teen bhai gaanv main kheti kisaani karte the par unke sabhi bade bhaaiyon ne verma ji kii padhai likhaai par na sirf vishesh dhyaan diya balki apni ruchi ke anusaar karmkshetra chunane ke liye bhi protsaahit kiya
 The family never objected to coming directly into politics after studies, but encouraged and supported them in every possible way
 sarvapratham ve 1957 main socialist party se bhoganipur vidhansabha kshetra uttar pradesh vidhaan sabha ke sadsy chune gayi, us samay unki umr maatr 34 varsh kii thi
 He was elected a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the United Socialist Party in 1967, Independents in 1969, Shoshit Samaj Dal in 1989 and 1989
 1991 main chhathi baar shoshit samajadal se vidhaan sabha ke sadsy nirvaachit hue

 verma ji ne 1967-68 main uttar pradesh kii samvid sarkaar main vittamantri ke rup main 20 karod ke laabh kaa bajet pesh kar puure aarthik jagat ko achambhe main daal diya
 Of course this was a great achievement of the Samvid government
 kaha jaataa he ki ek baar sarkaar ghate main aane ke baad phaayde main nahin laayaa ja saktaa he, adhik se adhik rajkoshiya ghaataa kam kiya ja saktaa he
 It was a unique phenomenon in the economic history of the world, for which the world media interviewed Varma and wanted to know its secret
 sankshipt jabaab main to unhone yahi kaha ki kisaan se acha arthshaastri or kushal prashaasak koi nahin ho saktaa kyonki laabh-haani ke naam par log apana vyavsaay badalte rahete hai par kisaan sookhaa-baadh jhelte hue bhi kisaani karnaa nahin chhodta
 Verma ji may not have been a degree economist but had the distinction of being the son of a farmer
 babajood iske ki verma ji ne krishi, sinchai, shiksha, chikitsa, saarvajanik nirmaan jaise tamaam mahatvapurn vibhaagon ko gat varsh se dedh guna adhik bajet aavantit kiya tathaa karmchaariyon ke manhagaai bhatte main vruddhi karte hue phaayde kaa bajet pesh kiya
 While completing his studies, Varma came under the influence of socialist ideology and joined the Joint Socialist Party under the leadership of Dr
 Lohia
 da0 raamamanohar lohia ko apni party ke liye ek yuva vichaarsheel netritv mil gaya jisaki talash unhen thi
 Dr
 Lohia felt that the most important thing about Verma ji's personality is that he has a thoughtful mind, he is sensitive, he has originality in his thoughts, the biggest thing was that this young farmer of the farmer family and the administrative position Turning and accepting politics as social action
 da lohia ko verma ji kaa jindagi ke prati ek fakiranaa najariya or niswaarthee-eemaandaar tathaa vichaarsheel vyaktitv bahut bhaayaa or unke sabase vishwasaneey vaicharik mitra ban gayi kyonki verma ji bhi da0 lohia kii tarah desh or samaaj ke liye kabir kii tarah apana ghar foonkane vaale rajnatik kabir the
 Verma ji was an eyewitness of the freedom struggle in his student life but he had a pang of not being able to participate in it, hence kicking off the official job of the Indian Administrative Service, chose politics as the medium of service and politics also of principles and values 
 unhone uttar pradesh vidhaan sabha ke liye pehla chunaav 1952 main bhoganipur chunaav kshetra se ek varisht kangersi netaa ramswaroop gupta ke viruddh ladaa or mahaj chaar hajaar maton se ve haare par 1957 ke chunaav main unhone ramswaroop gupta ko parajeet kiya
 He strongly hated the race for self-agreement agreements in politics
 unka dhyey ek aise samaaj kii sanrachana karnaa tha jisamen har koi puri maanviya garima ke saath jivan ji sake
 He was a strong warrior of socio-economic, social-political justice as well as social, economic, political and cultural equality and for this he insisted on fighting the battle of the quadrennial revolution i
e
 social, economic, political and cultural revolution
 verma ji ne 1969 main arjak sangh kaa gathan kiya or arjak saptahik kaa sampaadan or prakaashan prarambh kiya
 The Arjak Sangh was a platform of social revolution of its time which not only attacked superstition but also blew the trumpet of social justice movement in North India like Maharashtra and South India
 unhen uttar bharat kaa anmbedkar bhi kaha gaya
 All socialists like Mangaldev Visharad and Maharaj Singh Bharti were associated with this social justice movement of Varma ji and revolutionary ideological articles were published in Arjak Weekly
 us samay ke arjak saptahik kaa sangrah vichaaron kaa mahatvapurn dastavej he
 "why and how" did Varma ji, the autopsy of Brahmanism, the untouchable problem and solution, why and how the Brahmin glory? Wrote important books like Manusmriti stigma of the nation, how disrespect has been erased, confiscation and restoration of Ambedkar literature, Bhandafod, 'humanistic Quiz' published from Arjak Publications
 maharaj singh bharti or ramswaroop verma kii jodi "marks or angel" jaise vaicharik mitron kii jodi thi or donon kaa andaaj bebaak or fakiranaa tha
 Both belonged to the peasant family and both had deep pains of poverty, humiliation, injustice and exploitation in their hearts
 maharaj singh bharti ne saansad ke rup main puure vishwa kaa bhraman kar duniya ke kisaanon or unki jivan paddati kaa gahan adhyayan kiya or unhone mahatvapurn pustaken likhi
 His book "srishti and Pralaya" is a simple Hindi book on the collision of Darwin's "origin of Spices" which tells the common man what this world has become and also tells that it is not created by God but It is made up of natural rules of its own and man's labor has an important role in its development
 unki "ishwar kii khoj" or bharat kaa niojit diwaala jaisi anek vichaar parak pustaken hai jo arjak prakaashan se prakashit hui hai
 Jagdev Babu, known as 'lenin' of Bihar, influenced the ideas of Varma ji and his struggling personality to form the Shoshit Samaj Dal
 jagadev babu ke rajnetik sangharsh se aantkit hokar unke rajnatik pratidwandiyon ne unki hatya kara di
 Due to the martyrdom of Jagdev Babu, the exploited Samaj Dal suffered a deep blow, but the fire of social revolution intensified
 jagadev babu bihar ke pichde varg ke kisaan parivaar se the or verma ji kii tarah ve bhi apane sangharsh ke boote bihar sarkaar mantri rahe
 Varma's entire life was dedicated to the country and society
 unhone “jisamen samta kii chaah nahin / vah badhia insaan nahin, samta bina samaaj nahin / bin samaaj janraj nahin jaise kaaljayi naare gadhe
 His statement in an interview about politics and politicians is noted
 raajnneeti ke bare main unka maananaa he ki yah shuddharup se atyant samvedansheel saamaajik karm he or ek achche rajaneta ke liye sabase zyada jaruri he ki use desh or sthaneey samaaj kii samasya kii gahari or jamini samaj ho or unke hal karne kii patibaddhta ho
 The public considers their leader to be their ideal, therefore, along with simplicity, honesty, principality, duty is essential
 verma ji ne vidhayakon ke vetan badhaaye jane kaa vidhaan sabha main hameshaa virodh kiya or swayan use kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 Varma ji removed the English type writers from the secretariat in the Samvid government and presented the budget in Hindi for the first time, which tradition now continues
 verma ji ne bajet main khand-6 kaa samavesh kiya jisamen pradesh ke karmchaariyon / adhikariyon kaa lekha jokha hota he, iske pehle sarkarein karmchariyon ke bina kisi lekhe-jokhe ke apane karmchaariyon ko vetan detii thi
 There was totality in the thinking of Varma ji
 unhone kranti ko paribhaashit karte hue kaha ki "kranti jivan ke purv nirdhaarit mulyon kaa janhit main punirdhaaran karnaa he kranti he"
 His views are original, but he was influenced by the views of Babasaheb Dr
 Ambedkar, Charvak, Karl Marx and Gautam Buddha, but he disagreed with them somewhere
 yahi bebaaki unki khaasiyat thi

 The International Organization for Standardization, often called the ISO, is an international standards-making body composed of representatives of standards organizations of various nations
 isaki sthapana 23 farvari, 1947 ko hui thi, vishwavyaapee audyogic evam vanijyik maanakon ko ghoshit karne hetu
 Its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland
 yadhyapi ISO swayan ko ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kahata he, isaki maanak sthapit karne kii kshamta, jo ki praay vidhi ban jate hai, yaa to samjhauton ke dwaara, yaa phir rashtriya maan; yah isko gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon se adhik shaktishaalee banaata he
 In practice, it is working like a faculty or short-term organization, which has strong links with governments
 
 The logo or symbol of this organization is American English and French in two official languages
 isamen ISO akshar bhi sammilit hai, jinase yah praayah janaa jaataa he, jo ki isaki sankshipti he
 Rather this abbreviation is derived from the Greek / Greek word ἴσος, which means equal
 yah maanate hue ki sanghathan kaa bhinn bhashaaon main bhinn sankshipti banegi, yah tay kiya ki ek sarvyaapee sarvamaanya naam ISO hi chalaaya jaae
 This in itself proves the purpose of this organization
 ISO ke mukhya utpaada hai anterrashtriya maanak
 Only published by ISO are: Technical Reports, Technical Specialization, Publicly Available Specialties, Technical Corrigendum, and and Guide
 anterrashtriya maanak kaa roopakar hota he ISO xxrep 5 n sheershak, jahaan xxrep 5 n he maanak sankhya, xxrep 4 y he prakaashan kaa varsh, evam sheershak bataata he vishay
 yadi maanak sanyukt takneekee samiti JTC1 ke kaary kaa parinaam he, to IEC bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 ASTM is also incorporated into standards developed in collaboration with ASTM International
 dinaak evam IS kaa prayog apurna yaa aprakashit maanakon ke liye aprayogneey he, evam kuch paristhitiyon main prakashit kaary kaa sheershak bhi chhona ja saktaa he
 a technical report is issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has generally collected data of a different type from the published international standard, such as references or interpretations
 inaki namakaran pratha maanakon kii bhaanti hi he, keval TR lagaaya jaataa he IS ke sthaan par, report ke naam se pehle
 For example takneekee vishesheekaran ko tab rachit kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki "sambandhit vishay abhi bhi vikaas kii sthiti main hi he, yaa kisi anya karanvash bhavishya main kisi anterrashtriya maanak ko prakashit karne kii sahmati kii sambhaavna hoti he" 
 Publicly available specialties can be an "intermediate specialization that has been published prior to the development of the full international standard", or, a 'bicameral' publication in the IEC, published in collaboration with an external organization
 " Naming is done like a technical report
 udhaahrantah ISO sometimes also issues technical / technical corrigendum
 ye vartmaan maanakon ke sanshodhan hote hai, jo ki kshudra takneekee / paribhaashik trutiyon, prayogneeyata sudhaar yaa simit tareeke se prayojyata badhaane hetu kiye jate hai
 Often these are issued with the hope that the affected standard will be either quoted or withdrawn until their next scheduling overview

 Some standards are provided free of charge by ISO and its official United States Representative and International Electrotechnical Commission
 ISO ke 157 rashtriya sadsy hai, out of the 195 total countries in the world
 ISO has three membership categories: bhagidaar sadsy "P" yaa pi sadsy kehalaate hai, jabaki anupaalan karne vaale "O" yaa o sadsy kehalaate hai
 The fact that many iso-created standards are universal, ubiquitous; On many occasions, the general use of "ISO" has been inspired to describe a product that conforms to the standards
 iske kai udhaaharan hai: To deal with the consequences of abundant coverage in the areas of standardization, and the tasks related to information technology; a Joint Technical Committee constituted from ISO & IEC or International Electrotechnical Commission known as ISO / IEC JTC1
 yah asi pratham samiti he, evam ajtak ek hi he
 Its official order is to develop, maintain, promote IT standards for business and user requirements in worldwide markets
 vartmaan main 18 up-samitiyaan hai :- Membership of ISO / IEC JTC1 is restricted to the same extent as that of its parent organizations
 ek sadsy yaa to bhagidaar yaa prekshak ho saktaa he
 The only difference between the proposed standards and other products is the ability to vote
 kisi sadsy sanstha ke liye kisi yaa prayek up-samiti par str / raay banaae rakhane kii, koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Occasionally, sub-committees may be formed, or even dissolved, to cope with new situations if their area of work is no longer in force
 ISO / TS jaise, antarrashtriya kaaryshaala samjhauta International Workshop Agreement bhi ISO kaa ek or shastraagaar he, jo ki un kshetron main, jahaan takneekee sanrachana evam nipunata abhi nahin pahaunchi he; vahaan maanakeekaran kii aavashyaktaaon par twarit pratikriya uplabdh karaata he
 This utility caters to worldwide technological urgency
 modulan ek weveform ke sambandh main duusare weveform se alag karne kii prakriya he
 In telecommunications, modulation is used to send a message, but a composer uses it to separate the volume, timing or timing, and accentuation of an instrument's tone for vocal harmony
 aksar ucch aavruti sinusoid weveform kaa istemaal lo-frequency sanket ke karier sanket ke rup main hota he
 There are three major parameters of a sine wave - its own amplitude, its phase and its frequency, all of these communication signals can be modified based on low frequency to obtain a modulated signal
 jo upkaran adhimishran ko anjaam detaa he modulator kehalaata he or jo upkaran vipareet kriya karata he demodulator kehalaata he
 The device that can do both types of tasks is called a modem
 ankiy adhimishran kaa uddeshy ankiy bit stream ko ek anuroop pasband channel main sthaanantaran karnaa he, udhaahranswaroop; saarvajanik switchd telephone network,, yaa ek simit radio frequency band par sthaanantaran karnaa he
 The purpose of analog modulation is to transfer an analog baseband signal, for example to transfer an audio signal or TV signal to an analog passband channel, another example is to limit the radio frequency band or cable TV network channel
 anuroop or ankiy adhimishran frequency divijan multiplexing, ko aasaan banaata he, jabaki isi ke saath kai lo-paas soochna sanket kaa sthaanantaran ek saajhe bhautik madhyam se alag pasband channelon kaa upyog kar ke jariye hota he
 Digital baseband modulation systems, also called line coding, also aim to transfer a baseband channel over a digital bit stream via a serial bus or wire-connected local area network such as a non-filter-copper wire
 pulse adhimishran pranali kaa uddeshy ek nairoband anuroop sanket ko sthaanantarit karnaa he, udhaahranswarup phone kol kaa wideband besaband channel par aana, yaa kuch yojanaon main beet stream kaa ek duusare ankiy transmishan system main aana
 In analog modulation, the modulation on the analog information signal is continuous
 saamaanya anuroop adhimishran takanic nimna prakaar ke hote hai : In digital modulation, the analog carrier signal is modulated by a digital bit flow
 ankiy adhimishran paddati main ankiy se anuroop roopantaran ho saktaa he or demodyulation yaa ditection main anuroop se ankiy main roopantaran ho saktaa he
 Changes in the carrier signal are chosen from a finite number of m option symbols
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan : ek telephone line ko shravan yogya dhwani ko sthanantarit karne ke liye dizine kiya gaya he, udhaaharan ke liye ek tone ko len, yah ankiy bits nahin he
 This is why computers can connect to the telephone via modems, which represent digital bits by tones, called symbols
 agar vahaan chaar vikalp ke pratik hai, pehla pratik bit seqvence 00 kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he, isi tarah doosraa 01 ko, teesraa 10 or chauthaa 11
 agar kisi modem main 1000 tone prati second vaala sangeet bajataa he, to iskaa pratik dar 1000 pratik / prati second, yaa bod hoga
 chunki is udhaaharan main harek tone do ankiy bits vaala ek massej kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, isliye bit dar pratik dar kaa duguna yani 2000 bits prati second hota he
 According to one definition of a digital signal, the modulated signal is a digital signal, but in another definition, modulation is also called the conversion from digital to analog
 zyaadaatar pathyapustakon main ankiy adhimishran skim ko ankiy transmishan ke rup main, data transmishan kaa hi paryaay maan liya gaya he, bahut kam pathyapustakon main ise anuroop transmishan kaha gaya he
 The most fundamental digital modulation techniques are as follows: QAM main, ek infez sanket or ek kshetrakalan charan aayam ek parimit sankhya main abhivyakt hoti he
 This can be seen as a two-channel system, with each channel using ASK
 parinamswaroop sanket PSK or ASK donon ke sammishran ke baraabar hota he
 In each of the above methods, each phase, frequency or amplitude is dictated by an amazing double beats pattern
 aamtaur par, harek charan frequency yaa aayam kii saamaan sankhya ke beats kaa kutalekhan karti he
 The symbol included in this number of bits is represented by a particular phase
 yadi varnmaala main m = 2 n { \ displaystyle M=2^{N}} vaikalpik pratik ke rup main shaamil he to harek pratik n bits ke sandesh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 If the symbol rate f s { \ displaystyle f_ {S}} is the symbol per second, the data rate is n f s { \ displaystyle Nf_ {S}} beats per second
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek varnmaala jisame 16 vaikalpik pratik hai, harek pratik 4 bits kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Therefore the data rate will be four times the baud rate
 PSK, ASK yaa QAM, jahaan adhimishrit sanket kii carrier frequency sthir he vahaan adhimishran varnmaala aksar aasaani se raashi rekhachitr kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, harek sanket ke liye aayam ke i sanket ko x-axis or q sanket ko y-axis dwaara darshata he
 PSK and ASK using the principle of QAM, but sometimes FSK are also frequently generated and detected
 i or q sanket ko jatil-maan sanket i +jq main joda ja saktaa he
 Consequently the actual value known as the equivalent low-pass signal or the equivalent baseband signal is the complex signal physical value representing the complex value
 modulator dwaara data sanchaarit ke liye upyogi nimnlikhit saamaanya kadam hai : The de-modulator usually performs the following on behalf of the receiver: sabhi ankiy sanchaar vyavastha main yah aam he ki modulator or di-modulator donon kaa dizin ek hi saath kiya janaa chahie
 ankiy adhimishran yojanaayen sambhav hai kyonki preshak-praapak donon pakshon ko pehle se jaankaree honi chahie ki kis tarah data kaa kutalekhan kiya jaae or sanchaar vyavastha kaa kaise pratinidhitiv kiya jaae
 sabhi ankiy sanchaar pranaaliyon main, preshak ke aaparivartak or praapak ke di-modulator donon ko is tarah banaaya jaay ki apane kaam ke alaava ek-duusare kaa bhi kaam kar saken
 In the incompatible modulation method, a receiver does not need the reference clock signal that occurs in the same phase with the sender carrier wave
 In such a case, the modulation moves asynchronously in the signal
 iskaa vipareet anukool adhimishran he
 The most common digital modulation techniques are as follows: MSK or GMSK satat charan adhimishran ke vishesh maamlen hai
 Indeed, the MSK of the subcumbus of CPM is a special case, which is also known as a symbolic-time period of continuous phase frequency-shift keying, which is a rectangular frequency pulse
 OFDM frequency divijan multiplexing par aadhaarit he, lekin iskaa upyog ek ankiy adhimishran yojana ke taur par kiya jaataa he
 The bit stream is divided into several parallel data strings and each stream is transferred to its subcarrier using the traditional digital modulation scheme
 OFDM sanket ek adhimishrit sab-carrier kaa sankshipt rup he
 OFDM is considered as a modulation technique rather than a multidimensional technique, as it transfers a bit stream to a communication channel using a sequence of so-called ofdms
 OFDM kaa vistaar chanelle acces paddati se orthogonal frequency divijan multiple acces or MC-CDMA skim se multi-eusar channel main kiya ja saktaa he, taaki bahut saare upyog kartaaon ko vibhinn sab-carrier yaa kai upyog kartaaon ko code dekar ek hi madhyam kaa upyog karne kii anumati den saken
 The two types of RF power amplifier, the switching expander, are low-cost and use less battery power than the liner amplifier with the same output power
 baharhaal, ve keval apekshaakrit sthir aayam adhimishran sanket jaise ki koniya adhimishran or CDMA ke saath kaam karata he, lekin QAM or OFDM ke saath nahin
 haalanki swichan vistaarak ek saamaanya QAM samooh ke liye bhi puri tarah se anupyukt he, baavjood iske aksar QAM adhimishran siddhant kaa istemaal swichan vistaarakon ko in FM or anya weveform ke saath chalane main kiya jaataa he or kabhi kabhi QAM di-modulation kaa istemaal in swimming vistaarakon dwaara sanket praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The term baseband modulation is synonymous with line code or symbol
 ye ankiy beet stream kaa anuroop besaband main sthanantaran karne kii paddati he, jiskaa istemaal ek pulse train, jo ki asatat sankhya vaala sanket level he, kaa prayog pratyaksh rup se modulatting ke jariye cabel main voltage or curent main kiya jaataa he
 Common examples are Unipolar, non-return-to-zero, Manchester and Alternate Mark Inverson coding
 pulse adhimishran yojana kaa uddeshy ek nairoband anuroop sanket kaa sthaanantaran anuroop besaband main do str ke sanket ke rup main adhimishran ke jariye pulse wave main karnaa he
 Some pulse modulation scheme narrowband analog signal to a numerical signal a fixed bit rate; Which can be transferred as an embedded numeric sender method, for example some line codes, allowing transfer
 aupchaarik myne main ye adhimishran yojana ke tahat nahin aate, kyonki ye chanelle kutalekhan yojana nahin hai, lekin inhen strot kutalekhan yojana kii tarah liya janaa chahie or kuch maamalon main anuroop se ankiy roopantaran takanic ke rup main

 The reason for this confusion is to be accepted by the intellect as their right

 Many personal computers in the later 1980s and early 1990s displayed at most 256 different colors, freely selected by software from their wider hardware's color palette
 The color palettes of some of the most popular early personal computers and terminals
 They may be based on RGB palettes, but also common are specific hardware-implemented 4, 16 or more colors palettes: not bit nor level combinations of RGB primaries, but fixed ROM / circuitry colors selected by the manufacturer
 Many of early models output composite video ypbpr colors
 When seen on TV devices, the perception of the colors may be not related with the value levels for the ypbpr values employed

 Apart from her children, the burden of joint family also fell on Nirala
 pehle mahayuddh ke baad jo mahamari faili usamen na sirf patni manohara devi kaa, balki chachaa, bhai or bhabhi kaa bhi dehanth ho gaya
 Mahishadal's job was insufficient to carry the remainder of the clan
 iske baad kaa unka sara jivan aarthik-sangharsh main beetaa
 The most special thing in Nirala's life is that even under the most difficult circumstances, he did not abandon the principle and adopt the path of compromise, did not lose the courage of struggle
 jivan kaa uttararddh elahabaad main beetaa
 At the same time, on 15 October 1961, he finished his race in a room just behind the huge kothi of Raisahab located in Daraganj locality

 Pre-published and unpublished complete works in 8 volumes named Nirala Rachnavali sooryakanth treepathi ‘niraala’ kii kavyakala kii sabase badi visheshta he chithran-kaushal
 Be it internal expressions or outer world scenes, musical sounds or colors and smells, live characters or natural scenes, all the different elements are mixed together to create such a vibrant picture that the reader can read through those pictures One can reach the heart of Nirala
 niraala ke chitron main unka bhavabodh hi nahin, unka chintan bhi samahit rahata he
 Hence, philosophical depth is generated in many of his poems

 It was his peasant spirit that inspired him to move beyond the land of shadowism and create a new land of realism
 vishesh sthitiyon, charitron or drishyon ko dekhte hue unke marm ko pahchaanana or un vishisht vastuon ko hi chithran kaa vishay bananaa, niraala ke yatharthwaad kii ek ullekhneey visheshta he
 Nirala is also influenced by life-oriented tendencies like spiritualism and mysticism
 is asar ke chalate ve bahut baar chamatkaaron se vijay praapt karne or sangharshon kaa ant karne kaa sapana dekhte hai
 The power of Nirala is that they do not sit idle by miracles and do not steal their eyes from the real challenge of the struggle
 kahin-kahin rahasyavaad ke pher main niraala vaastavik jivan-anubhavon ke vipareet chalate hai
 Light has spread everywhere, life has sunk in the luminous ocean, etc
 Such things are there
 lekin yah rahasyavaad niraala ke bhavabodh main sthaayee nahin rahata, vah kshanbhangur hi sabit hota he
 Many times they play with weird words, sounds etc

 But they usually do a lot of miraculous artistic experiments through these messes
 in prayogon kii visheshta yah he ki ve vishay yaa bhav ko adhik prabhaavshaalee rup main vyakt karne main sahaayak hote hai

 1959 main party samvidhan se is patibaddhta ko hataane kaa prayaas vifal ho gaya
 Tony Blair and other modern leaders continued to work in this context, and after 35 years, despite little opposition from senior leaders, this principle of necessary commitment was successful in removing it from the party constitution
 1992 ke baad se party ke ghoshnaptr se samaajwaad shabd gaayab ho gaya
 Although the Fourth Clause still shows commitment to democratic socialism, it does not speak of compulsory government control over all industry ventures

 is baithak main baari sankhya main kaamkaazi logon, mazdooron or vampanthi vichaardhaara vaale dalon ne hissaa liya
 After the debate, 129 members gave approval to Thomas's proposal to form a party in Parliament under a banner that would have its own wikt: whip and any organization that would work for the interests of the workers and help in making laws or Will support the team in every way

 iske baad 1906 ke aam chunaavon main elarsi ne 29 siten jiti
 This was due to a hidden agreement between Ramsay macdonald and the Liberal party as part of a strategy of not dividing the votes of the workers in the election between the Liberals and Labor

 Following the weakening of the Liberals, the Labor Party won 142 seats of parliament in the general elections of 1922 and thus emerged as the second largest party in the House of Commons after the Conservative Party

 churchill waar mantralay ke saath party ek baar phir 1940 main satta main lauti
 When Neville Camberlane resigned as prime minister in 1940, then the incoming monarch of the monarchy, Winston Churchill, decided to bring all other parties together, like this experiment during World War I
 clement attali ko lord privi sil or yuddh mantralay kaa sadsy chunaa gaya

 The major developments with the help of surgical robots are remote surgery, minimally invasive surgery and unmanned surgery
 Some of the major benefits of robotic surgery are accuracy, miniaturization, small incisions, less blood loss, less pain and acute disease improvement
 Other advantages are expression beyond normal manipulation and three-dimensional magnification, leading to better labor efficiency

 International relations is the study of relations between different countries, as well as the role of sovereign states, inter-governmental organizations, international ngos, non-governmental organizations and multinationals
 anterrashtriya sambandh ko kabhi-kabhi 'antararashtriya adhyayan' ) ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, haalanki donon shabd puri tarah se paryaay nahin hai
 In simple terms, 'international politics' means 'doing politics among states'
 yadi 'raajnneeti' ke arth kaa adhyayan karen to teen pramukh tatv saamne aate hai - samoohon kaa astitv; samoohon ke bich sahmati; tathaa samoohon dwaara apane hiton kii purti
 If we assess this effect internationally, then these three elements are mainly - the existence of states; Conflict between states; And the use of power to fulfill their national interests
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti un kriyaaon kaa adhyayan karnaa he jiske antargat rajya apane raashtra hiton kii purti hetu shakti ke aadhaar par sangharshrat rahete hai
 In this context, national interests are the main goals of international politics; Conflict sets its direction; And Shakti is considered as the main means of achieving this objective
 parantu uparyukt paribhaasha ko ham paramparaagat maan sakate hai, kyonki aaj ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ kaa sthaan isse vyapak avadharana ‘antarrashtriya sambandhon’ ne le liya he
 Under this, along with mutual conflict of states, the collaborative aspects are now studied under international politics
 iske atirikt aaj ‘rajyon’ ke alaava anya kai kaarak bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vishay kshetra ban gaye hai
 Therefore, under this, individuals, institutions, organizations and many other non-state units have also joined
 iskaa vartmaan aadhaar va vishay kshetra aaj kaaphi vyapak swaroop le chukaa he
 Before discussing all these topics, it becomes very essential to review the following definitions given by different scholars- in paribhaashaon kaa dayera ati simit he, kyonki iske antargat multah ‘rajyon’ ko hi anterrashtriya raajnneeti ke kaarak ke rup main mana gaya he
 It is limited to the nature of international politics
 mukhya rup se hence je
 margenthau, herald spraoot, bone doyak, thampsan aadi iske mukhya samarthak hai jo inaki nimna paribhaashaon se spasht ho jaataa he- International definitions discuss the broad nature of international politics, international relations
 isamen rajya ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke naveen karkon jaise antarrashtriya sanghathan, deshaantar samooh, gaiyr sarkari sanghathan, antarrashtriya santhaayen, kuch vyaktiyon aadi ko bhi sammilit kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, along with the struggle, cooperation and politics, as well as directly or indirectly affecting it, ie, cultural, religious, social, science and technical aspects are also mentioned
 vibhinn lekhakon kii nimnlikhit paribhaashaon se yah aashay ati spasht rup main ujagar ho jaataa he- In this way the nature of international politics becomes very broad from the beginning to the present
 isamen aaj raashtra rajyon ke saath vibhinn vishwa ikaayiyon evam sanghathanon ke adhyayan kaa samavesh ho chukaa he
 But even after all these changes, the focal point of these studies is still a nation state
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ke bare main nimna nishkarsh saamne aate hai
 Therefore, the nature of international politics is variable
 jab-jab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke parivesh, karkon va ghatnakram main parivartan aayegaa, iske adhyayan karne ke tareekon va drushtikonon main bhi parivartan anivaary he
 Additionally, this change is continuous rather than permanent
 iske saath-saath vibhinn karkon, staron, ayaamon aadi ke kaaran yah bahut jatil he atah iske sucharu adhyayan hetu bahut spasht, tarksangat, vyapak drushtikon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As is known from the above definitions and form, the subject area of international politics is increasing
 aaj iskaa vishay kshetra kaaphi vyapak ho gaya he jiske antargat nimnlikhit baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he- Therefore, today the subject area of international politics is very broad and complex and is moving towards development
 iske antargat vibhinn paramparaagat karkon ke saath-saath gaiyr-paramparaagat karkon kaa adhyayan bhi mahatvapurn hota ja rahaa he
 The history of the development of international politics is not very ancient, rather the subject is a product of the twentieth century
 spasht rup se dekha jaae to velj vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya woodro wilson peeth kii 1919 main sthapana se hi iskaa itihaas prarambh hota he

 isi samay anya vishvavidhyalayon evam sansthaanon main bhi isi prakaar kii vyavasthaaen dekhne ko mili
 Therefore, if we look at the history of this subject in the last one century, then along with the ups and downs in this subject, information about its establishment in an autonomous subject is available
 is vishay main aaye bahuaiami parivartanon ne jahaan ek ore vishaywastu kaa sanvardhan, samanvay tathaa vikaas kiya he, vahiin duusari ore vibhinn siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karke bahut si jatil samasyaon evam pahaluon ko samajhane main sahaayta pradaan kii he
 Kenneth Thompson in his 1962 review, Review of Politics, has divided the history of international politics into four parts, on the basis of which a clear and sure study of this subject can be possible
 vikaas ke in chaar charnon main shityudhottar yug ke paanchaven charan ko bhi sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 Their detailed description is as follows: pratham vishwayuddh se purv itihaas, kanoon, raajnneeti shaastra, darshan shaastra aadi ke vidwaan hi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke alag-alag pahaluon par vichaar karte the
 It was mainly historians who studied it as diplomatic history and the history of relations with other countries
 iske antargat kootneetigyon va videsh mantriyon dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon kaa lekha jokha hota tha
 Hence, it is also known as diplomatic history
 i
ech
car ke anusaar pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh kaa sambandh keval sainikon tak samajha jaataa tha tathaa iske samakaksh antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa sambandh rajanyikon tak
 In addition, even in democratic countries, foreign policy was traditionally kept separate from party politics and the elected members also felt unable to control the foreign ministry
 1919 se purv is vishay ke prati udaseenta ke kai pramukh kaaran the - pratham, is samay tak yahi samajha jaataa tha ki yuddh va rajyon main gathbandhan usee prakaar swaabhaavik he jaise garibi va berogari
 Therefore, preventing war, foreign policy and mutual relations between states was considered out of the control of human power
 dwitiya, pratham vishwa yuddh se purv yuddh itane bhayankar nahin hote the
 Third, in the absence of means of communication, international politics was limited to a few states
 is prakaar is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan kii sabase badi kami saamaanya hiton kaa vikaas rahaa
 In this period, only a descriptive study of diplomatic history was done
 parinamswaroop, isse na to vartmaan tathaa na hi bhavi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane main koi madad mili
 The quantum achievement of this era was the establishment of the Chair of the Study of International Politics at the University of Wales in 1919
 do vishwa yudhon ke bich ke kaal main do samaanaantar dhaaraon kaa vikaas hua
 The first of which emphasized the study of current events / problems, except for the dominance of earlier historicity
 iske saath saath ab aitihaasik raajnneetik adhyayan ko vartmaan raajnneetik sandarbhon ke saath jod kar dekhne kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 Despite the diminishing of historical influence, there still remains a lack of a holistic approach to the study of international politics
 is kaal main vartmaan ke adhyayan par to bahut bal diya gaya, lekin vartmaan evam ateet ke parsparik sambandh ke mahatv ko abhi bhi pahachaanaa nahin gaya
 In addition, neither was there an attempt to see post-war political problems with comparable problems of the past
 shaayad isiilie is yug main bhi do moolbhoot kamiyaan spasht rup se ujagar raheen
 First, like the first phase, universal principles could not develop in international politics even in this period
 dwitiya, aaj bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa adhyayan adhik suspasht evam tarksangat nahin ban paaya
 Thus, in this phase, there was not much change in the study of international politics except the change in the status of force, nor was the confirmation of this subject becoming an explicitly independent discipline
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa tritiy charan bhi dwitiya charan ke samaanaantar do vishwa yudhon ke bich kaa kaal rahaa
 It is called the era of reformism because it envisaged reform of international politics through the establishment of the League of Nations by the states
 is yug main mukhya rup se sansthagat vikaas kiya gaya
 The scholars, diplomats, politicians and thinkers of this period believed that if international institutions are developed, then the problems of war and peace present in front of the world community will be possible
 is uddeshy hetu kuch kanoonee va naitik upagamon kii sanrachanaayen kii gai jinke nimna mukhya aadhaar the
 International organization was envisaged with emphasis on these ideals and moral values
 isaki sthapana ke uparant yah mana gaya ki ab antarrashtriya sambandhon main rajyon ke madhya shaanti banane kaa sangharsh samaapt ho gaya
 There will be no place of balance of power under the new system
 ab rajya apane vivaadon kaa nipataara sangh ke madhyam se karenge
 Therefore, in this era not only the problems of war and peace were discussed, but its far-reaching reforms were also thought of
 atah adhyayankartaaon ke mukhya bindu bhi kanoonee samasyaon va sanghathanon ke vikaas ke saath-saath inke madhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop ko badalane vaala rahaa
 Finally, in this period more emphasis has been laid on emotional, imaginative and moral reformism
 parantu vishwayudhon ke bich in upagamon kii sarthakata par hameshaa prashn chihn laga rahaa
 While the first decade of United Nations activities showed a ray of hope, the economic situation of the second decade completely ended this notion
 badi shaktiyon ke madhya asahyog va gutbandiyon ne shaanti kii sthapana kii bajaay shakti sangharsh vyavastha ko janm diya
 While Japan invaded Manchuria and disrupted peace, Italy, Germany and Russia not only relinquished membership of the League in controversial situations, but also intensified the process of the start of World War II
 is prakaar shaanti, naitikta, va kanoon se vishwa vyavastha nahin chal saki, to i
ech
car, shumbha, quinci rhit aadi lekhakon ke kaaran yathartwaadee drushtikon ko vaikalpik upaagam ke rup main bal mila
 The fundamental changes in international politics at this stage not only broadened its content but also led to many complications
 shitayugin kaal main raajnneeti ke swaroop main parivartan tathaa naye rajyon ke udai ne sampoorn antarrashtriya parivesh ko hi badal diya
 As a result, new approaches, dimensions, institutions and trends were created through which the study of international relations was ensured
 purv charnon kii aadarshik, sansthagat, naitik, kanoonee evam sudhaarwadi dhaaraon kii asafalataaon ne naye upagamon ke vikaas kii ore agrasar kiya
 This new approach was realism
 vaise to i
ech
car, shwarjanbarger, quinci rhit, shubhaan aadi lekhakon ne is drushtikon ko viksit kiya, parantu hence je
 margenthau ne ise ek saamaanya siddhanth ke rup main prastut kiya
 According to this theory, states are always struggling to fulfill their interests
 atah anterrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane hetu is shakti sangharsh ke vibhinn ayaamon ko samajhnaa ati aavashyak he
 International organization also originated in the form of assured and unambiguous development of international institutions with realistic outlook
 ab is sanghathan kaa swaroop maatra adarshavaadi va sudhaarwadi na hokar, mahatvapurn raajnneetik sanghathan ke rup main ubhar kar aayaa
 Under this, apart from saving mankind from the ravages of war, what are the reasons for the conflict between the states? What are the risk factors for world peace? How can peace be established? How can arms race be stopped? Efforts were also made to find solutions to many types of questions
 uparokt do pravritiyon ke saath-saath vyavahaarwad kii utpatti bhi is yug kii mahatvapurn uplabdhi rahi
 An attempt was made to understand international politics by creating "system theory" through a pragmatic approach
 is upaagam ke antargat rajyon ke adhyayan hetu teen pramukh karkon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa zaruri mana gaya
 These factors were- uparokt pravritiyon kaa mukhya bal antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saiddhantikaran ko badhaava dena rahaa he
 Therefore, it has been a very important task in this era to propose the universal principles of international politics
 siddhanth nirmaan kii is prakriya ke parinaam swaroop anek aanshik siddhanton jaise - yatharthwaad, santulan kaa siddhanth, sanchaar siddhanth, krida siddhanth, saudebaaji kaa siddhanth, shaanti anusandhan drushtikon, vyavastha siddhanth, vishwa vyavastha pratimaan aadi kaa nirmaan hua
 Despite the rendering of these principles, there still remains a lack of any universal and common principle in this era
 1990 ke dashak main jaint bandhopadhyaay ne apni pustak - general theory of international rilations - main martin kaplan ke vyavasthaaparak siddhanth kii kamiyon ko dur kar ek saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana kii koshish kii he, parantu vah bhi abhi vaad-pratwaad ke daur main hi hai
 Therefore, despite the main phase of theorization, the era of the Cold War remained deprived of any one general principle due to its ideological narrowness and isolation
 shityudhottar yug main sabhi rashtron dwaara ek aarthik vyavastha ke antargat judana prarambh kar diya
 That is why the era of globalization, liberalization, free market system etc
 has started
 is sandarbh main na keval aarthik muddon kaa hi mahatv badha, apitu antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa mahatv or bhi bad gaya
 Today, the distinction of nationalism and internationalism has ended
 Apart from this, now the table of international politics has included a lot of new topics which, instead of being national, now emerge as problems of mankind
 vartmaan vishwa kii pramukh samasyaon main aatankwaad, paryaavaran, ozon parat ksheen hona, nashile padaarthon evam maadak dravyon kii taskari, maanavadhikaron kaa hanan aadi pramukh mudde ubhar kar saamne aaye jinka rashtriya str yaa kshetray str kii bajaay antarrashtriya str par hal nikaalnaa anivaary ban gaya he
 Even at the theoretical level, the attempt to establish the universal principle from 1945 to 1991 got a shock
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii is sandarbh main ab praathamiktaayen badal gai
 In post-modernism, the significance of universal principles are now being questioned
 aitihaasik sandarbh evam pracheen parivesh ke prabhaav ko bhi nakaara ja rahaa he
 Now the independent issues have become more important
 vrihat siddhanth gaun ho gaye hai
 Partial research has become more important in the new context
 udhaahranswaroop nariwad, maanavadhikaar, paryaavaran aadi vishyon par adhik bal dene ke saath-saath chintan bhi prarambh ho gaya he
 Therefore, in the post-cold War era, the nature, content and subject area of international politics have completely changed
 ab saamaanya saiddhanthik sthapana par bhi adhik bal nahin diya ja rahaa he
 That is why, in this changed environment, international politics seems to be not only important but also towards autonomy
 or vishay kii swaittata hetu ashaavadi sanket dikhaai dete hai
 The Second World War not only influenced international politics fundamentally, but also expressed many important issues
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke karkon main parivartan, karkon ko vyapak swaroop pradaan karnaa, naveen siddhanton kaa pratipaadan aadi anek vishyon ke atirikt antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa purna parivesh hi badal kar rakh diya he
 While there is a debate on the theoretical level of realism and idealism on the one hand, and on the ancient and scientific debate, on the other hand controversial questions were being raised about the format of international relations topic - whether international relations is a Autonomous subject or not? Although it is being taught as an autonomous subject at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and research in most universities today, it is not recognized as equivalent to other subjects of social science
 itnaa avashya hua he ki viksit deshon main to kai vishvavidhyalayon main ise purna rup se swytt vishay ke rup main padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Developing countries like India have also improved
 yahaan prarambh main ‘bhartiya antarrashtriya sambandh skool, nai dilli’ jo baad main jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya sambandh skool ke rup main swytt rup se kaary kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, many other universities like Jadavpur University, Calcutta, Goa University etc
 have also got the status of autonomous subjects
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ko ek swytt vishay ke rup main adhyayan karne se purv ek baat spasht kerani ati aavashyak he ki jab ham is vishay kii swaittata ke prashn kaa adhyayan karte hai to ‘antarrashtriya raajnneeti’ va antarrashtriya sambandhon ko alag-alag vishay nahin maanate hai
 This has been done because both disciplines are still recognized as a sub-discipline of the subject of political science rather than as an autonomous discipline
 duusare inkaa vibhed itnaa sookshm he ki anushaasan kii swaittata kii pramanikta ke baad is vishay ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 In the context of considering international politics as an autonomous subject, three different views have been given which are as follows - jo vidwaan is vishay ko swytt maanate hai unke anusaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay vastu va anushaasan sambandhi saamagree ko dekhte hue ise ek swytt vishay mana janaa chahie
 The main proponents of this argument are - CAW
 Manning, Quincy Right, Robert Lotting Allen, Hannes J
 Margenthau, Carl M
 Copper Johnson, Hoffmann; AL Burn etc
 in vidwaanon ne nimna aadhaaron par ise swytt vishay pramanit kiya he- Those scholars who do not consider international politics as an autonomous subject, believe that there is no such unique thing in this subject that it should be considered autonomous for study
 unhone nimna tarko ke aadhaar par apni baat kaa samarthan kiya he- Some scholars consider both of the above debates as meaningless
 unka maananaa yah he ki uparyukt donon tarkon ko antarrashtriya raajnneeti main hue vikaas ke madhyam se adhik bhalee prakaar se janaa ja saktaa he
 Therefore, a review of the development of the 20th century, and especially after 1945, is extremely essential
 yadi antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii swaittata ke prashn kaa gahan adhyayan karte hai to pataa chalata he ki is sandarbh main do moolbhoot samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 One, there have been effective changes in the nature, content and methods of international relations
 doosraa, isi samay raajnneetishastra kii paridhi kii jatiltaaon evam aparibhaashit simaaon ke vikaas ke kaaran samasya or bad gai he
 But if we look at the development of international politics from 1919 till date, it is clear that its achievements will prove very helpful in giving it autonomy
 1919 ke baad se hi, visheshkar america main, bahut se vidwaanon ne is vishay ko adhik se adhik vaigyanik banane hetu prayaas kiye hai
 Efforts have also been made to explain its content, methods and principles

 car aadi kaa yogadan saraahneey rahaa he
