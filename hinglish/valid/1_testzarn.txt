 jis vigyaapan ko samajhane main darshak ko dimag lagaana padegaa uske prati vah judaav mahasoos nahin kar paaegaa
 In such a situation when people will not understand it, how will we move towards using the product? vigyapandaata ko chahie ki vah jis utpaada ko vigyaapit karnaa chahta he usase jude tamaam tathyon ko kramvaar prastut kare
 In fact, the need to create an advertisement was realized only because it is not attracted to anyone who does not need it
 tathyon kii tarkpurna prastuti se log vigyaapan ke prati khulaapan mahasoos karte hai
 The ad must have the quality to speed up the thinking of the viewer or the reader even when it is stationary
 iske liye usamen gatyaatmak sanket hone aavashyak hai, jisase vigyaapan jahaan samaapt ho, dekhne vaala uske aage ko sochakar uske upyog ke liye apana man banaae
 The ad title should be attractive

 saamaanya rap se upabhokta athwa janata paramparik rap se jis vastu kaa upyog karti aayi he use chhodkar nayi vastu ke prati usamen andeh bana rahata he
 Through advertising, interest is generated in the consumer towards the new product produced
 keval vastu hi nahin, utpaadankarta, vastu kii upyogita tathaa uske gunon kii jaankaree dene kaa kaarybhi vigyaapan karata he
 In this way, the consumer has the option of comparing similar items, differentiating their prices, etc
 through advertising and he selects and uses his convenience to buy it
 vigyaapan se keval upabhokta kaa hi laabh nahin praapt hota balki use bechney vaale dukandaar arthath vikreta ko bhi laabh praapt hota he
 The ad seller makes the task so easy that he does not have to repeatedly tell the consumers about the new item
 sachai to yah he ki vigyaapan vastu ke saath hi saath vah kahan-kahan uplabdh he, isaki jaankaree muhaiyaa karaata he
 Hence, both consumers and sellers benefit from advertising
 vigyaapan ke madhyam se nayi vastua ke utpaadan tathaa uski upyogita kii jaankaree di jaati he jisase upabhokta kaa dhyaan us vastu ke istemaal kii ore kendrit hota he
 This is how advertising creates the market

 People have been making markets at their place of residence
 pehle log kisi vishesh din samay nikaalkar bazaar jate the, ab bazaar swayan unke paas aa gaya he
 All this has been possible due to advertising

 Due to this, language is developing and Hindi is becoming a living language of new times and society, not just the language of books

 His vocabulary, syntax, idioms etc
 are special
 hindi kaa bhi apana bhashaa sanskaar he
 In the present form of advertising, the status of renunciation of traditionalism and acceptance of modernity can be seen
 usamen keval utpaadak, utpaadit vastu or upabhokta hi nahin aata, balki jansanchaar ke sabhi madhyam or yatayat ke saadhan bhi aate hai, ye sabhi vigyaapan ke prasar main sahaayak hote he
 The use of Hindi verbs creates the ability to say more in advertisements
 bikaoo he, jararat he, chaahate ho, aate hai, jate hai, aaie jaise shabdon ke prayog se vigyapanon kii arthvatta badhati he
 The Hindi-vocabulary used in printed advertisements such as letters and magazines changes with the change of medium
 radiyon main jahaan dhvanyatmak shabdon kaa mahatv hota he vahiin televijan tathaa cinema main drishyaatmak kriyaapadon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, if an advertisement like 'apply Boroline' is printed to keep the skin soft on frosty days, then for radio - words like 'remove frosty sweetness Boroline', but Doordarshan and audio-visual
 Visuals in mediums such as' Have you seen? Did you know? Etc
 words are used
 vigyaapan ko aarthik vikaas ke liye dekha ja saktaa he, kai log vigyapanon ke saamaajik lagat par bhi dhyaan dena chaahate he
 Internet advertising is the prime example of this criticism
 internet vigyapanon spem jaise roopon main aakar computer ko kshati karte he
 Exploits the desires of a consumer by making the ads more attractive
 janata ke hit kii raksha ke prayaason kaa dhyaan dene ke liye vigyapanon kaa viniman kii gai he

 us samooh kii ruchi, aadaton evam mahatvakankshaon ko lakshya karke hi vigyaapan kii bhashaa, chitra evam akhbaar, patrikaon, sampreshan madhyamon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa he
 For example - if an entrepreneur prepares an item for women, then his style will be determined on the basis of: upabhokta samooh - mahilaayein Economic - Medium / Low / High shaikshik str - saadhaaran / ucch i do not use any such cream for my saloni skin

 All these are also prepared keeping the consumer group in mind
 udhaaharan swaroop yadi kaanlej ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye koi vastu taiyaar kii gai he to chust- furt yuvak - yuvatiyon kaa samooh vigyaapan main darshaya jaayegaa yaa phir ek khubasurat yuvati ko nihaarte yuvak dikhaaye jaayenge

 Now you can understand how this alliance of language and pictures is able to make a deep impact on consumers

 jo vigyaapan aapaki prasupt ichchhaaon ko puraa karata he, vah baaji maar jaataa he
 It is clear that advertising speaks its way through symbols
 vah kabhi hasya ke madhyam se, kabhi lay ke madhyam se, kabhi -kabhi bhay utpann karke bhi apane lakshya ko praapt karne kaa praytn karata he
 The artistry and creativity of advertising lies in the fact that it tries to look at situations from a new perspective
 jis tarah ek kavi bimbon ke madhyam se apni bhaavanaagan ko abhivyakt karata he
 In the same way, an advertisement also symbolically touches human desires, feelings and desires
 phool soundarya or prem ke pratik ban jate hai to duusari ore hare rang kaa shaitan manushya kii ishrya ko vyakt karata he 
 In this way you will begin to understand the style of advertisement
 vigyaapan phir aapako bahaka nahin paayenge, apitu apane aasapaas ke paridrishy evam maanav man kii aapaki samaj bhi gahari hogi
 Advertising is a complete art of communication

 vivechanaatmak vastuwaad se nimnlikhit siddhanton kaa bodh hota he- In financial accounting, a balance sheet or statement of financial position is the essence of a sole proprietorship, business partnership, or financial balance of a company
 iske tahat vittiya varsh ke ant main ek khaas taarikh par, aastiyaan, deyataayen evam swadhikrut equity soochibaddh kii jaati hai
 The balance sheet is usually called a "snapshot of the company's financial position"
 The balance sheet is the only statement in the four basic financial statements that is applicable for a particular period
 ek maanak company kii balance shit ke teen hisse hote hai: aastiyaan, deyataayen or swadhikrut equity
 aam taur par sampatti kii mukhya shreniyon ko pehle soochibaddh kiya jaataa hai
 Liabilities are accounted for along with assets
 aastiyaan or deytaon ke bich ke antar equity yaa shuddh sampatti athwa company kii shuddh sampatti yaa puunji ke rup main jane jate hai or lekhankan sameekaran ke anusaar shuddh sampatti kaa mulya deytaon ko chhodkar aastiyon ke baraabar hona chahie
 Another way to check this equation is that assets are equal to the sum of liabilities and owner's equity
 sameekaran ko is prakaar dekhne se yah pataa chalata he ki aastiyon kaa vitt poshan kaise hua he: nakad udhaar lekar athwa swami ke dhan kaa upyog kar
 tulan-patr main aam taur par ek hisse main aastiyon or duusare hisse main deytaon evam shuddh mulya ke vivaran ke saath donon hisson kaa "santulan" hota he
 The accounting system through which each account's value-marking or balance sheet entry is generally maintained is known as a double-entry bookkeeping system

 Although many businesses do not pay immediately; They list the company's stock, acquire their buildings and equipment
 duusare shabdon main: kaarobaar main parisampattiyaan hoti hai or prayek avadhi ke ant main chaahakar bhi ve turant apane saamaanon ko nakadi main nahin badal sakate
 aksar ye vyavsaay aapurtikartaaon or kar adhikariyon ko nakadi bhugtan karne ke liye dendar hote hai or vyavsaay ke swami apni kul mul puunji or munafa prayek avadhi ke ant main nahin uthaate hai
 In other words there are also liabilities in business

 a balance sheet is the summary of assets, equity and liabilities of an organization or individual for a particular period
 vyakti or chote vyavsaayon main saral balance shit taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 More complex balance sheets are introduced in large businesses and this is introduced in the annual report of the organization
 bade vyavsaay bhi apane vyapaar ke vibhinn kshetron ke liye balance shit taiyaar karte hai
 The balance sheet is often offered for comparison with other balance sheets of a particular duration
 ek vyaktigat tulan-patr main chaalu aastiyaan jaise ki pareekshanadhin rokad khate, bachat khate, dderghaavadhi aastiyaan jaise ki aam share or real estate, karj yaa bandhak karj ke rup main vartmaan deytaon yaa atideya or bandhak yaa anya karj ke rup main dderghaavadhi dendariyon kii suchi hoti he
 Securities and real estate values are listed at market value, not historical cost or cost basis
 The value of personal property is the difference between a person's total assets and total liabilities
 ek chote vyapaar ke balance shit main nakadi ke rup main vartmaan parisampattiyaan, lendaree lekhon, stock kii suchi, bhoomi, bhawan or upkarnon ke rup main achal sampatti, patent jaisi amoort sampatti, deyataayen jaise dendaree lekhe, jamaa kharch or lambii avadhi ke rin kii suchi hoti he
 Contingent liabilities such as warranties are recorded in the footnote of the balance sheet
 kul aastiyon or deytaon ke bich antar hi laghu vyavsaay kii kul equity he
 Guidelines for the balance sheets of public business entities are provided by the International Accounting Standards Committee and specialized organizations in many countries
 balance shit khaaton ke naam or upyog sanghathan ke desh or sanghathan ke prakaar par nirbhar karte hai
 Government organizations generally do not follow the standards set for individuals or businesses
 agar kaarobaar ke liye lagu hota ho to nimnlikhit madon ke liye saar mulya ko balance shit main shaamil kiya janaa chahie: Current assets achal parisampattiyaan The net assets shown by the balance sheet are equal to one-third of the balance sheet, known as shareholders' equity
 aupchaarik rup se, shairdharakon kii equity company kii deytaon kaa hissaa hoti he: vah kosh "shairdharakon ke kaaran" hota he haalanki aam taur par, "deytaon" kaa matlab shairdharakon ke sheyaron ko chhodkar adhik pratibandhaatmak arthon main nikaala jaataa he
 The balance of assets and liabilities is not accidental
 balance shit ke prayek khate ke mulyon kaa ricard ek pranali ke jariye rakhaa jaataa he, jise dohari pravishti bahikhaata paddati kaha jaataa he
 In this sense, the shareholders' equity through construction should be equal to the non-liability asset and the remaining portion is called residual
 nimnlikhit tulan patr sanrachana sirf ek udhaaharan he
 It does not represent all possible types of assets, equity and liabilities but is the most common
 kyonki yah sadbhaavna pradarshit karata he, isliye ek samekit tulan patr ho saktaa he

 agast 1945 main taiwan main hui tathakthith vimaan durghatana main jab subhash kii maut hui, anita paune teen saal kii thi
 Bose's daughter Anita is married and still alive
 uskaa naam anita phalf he
 She also occasionally visits India to meet her father's family members
 soshal media par kuch buddhijiviyon ne yah suzav pesh kiya tha ki rankoji mandir parisar ke pagoda main rakhi subhash kii asthiyaan japan sarkaar se bharat mangaa lee jaayen or unki putree anita phalf ko bharat bulaakar asthiyon kaa diene test kara liya jaye
 This will put an end to the controversy over whether Netaji died in a plane crash or not, and according to Hindu tradition, his daughter's wish to immerse his father's bones in the Ganges river will also be fulfilled
 ji news tivi chanelle ko diye ek saakshaatkaar main anita phalf apni yah ichha vyakt bhi kar chuki he
 Some people believe that while living in Faizabad for a long time, Gumnami Baba, who breathed his last there, was actually Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose who was living there in a disguised manner
 jab yah maamla elahabaad ucch nyaayalay le jaaya gaya to uski lakhanu bench ne is baat par hairaani jataayi ki bharat sarkaar ne japan ke rankoji mandir main rakhi raakh kaa diene test abhi tak kyon nahin karaayaa? Aleksandar Senkevich, poet, storyteller, literary translator and Indologist, was born in 1941

 His first book was dedicated to Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan
 unki duusari pustak thi- 'samaaj, samskruti, kavita- azaadi ke baad kii hindi kavita'
 Two of his books have also been published in Hindi
 1983 main garimashri prakaashan, dilli se 'bachchanah ek vyakhya' or 1984 main prakaashan santhaan, nai dilli se 'samakaleen hindi sahitya'
 Lexander Sekiewicz has also made a special place in Russian poetry as a poet
 unke abhi tak chaar kavita-sangrah aae hai, jinhen pathakon ne haathon-haath liya he
 In addition to poetry collections called 'casual Games' and 'chuvastva Bitya' published in 2002, Senkevich's 'shining Darkness' and recently published in 2007 are called 'purushuchana'
 iske alaava unhone ek upanyaas bhi likhaa he, jiskaa naam he- 'irina blawatskaya ke bhagya kaa rahasy' 
 Alexander Senkevich has translated the poems of all the great poets of twentieth-century Hindi into Russian, among whom the names of Agnayya, Bachchan, Ashok Vajpayee, Raghuvir Sahai, Srikant Verma, etc
 are prominent
 iske alaava unhone hindi ke apekshikrut yuva peedi ke kaviyon kii rachanaaon ke anuwaad bhi roosi main prakashit kiye hai jaise vishwanathprasad singh, gorakh pandeya, mangalesh dabraal, udai prakaash, narendra jain, arun camel

 He became very famous after his death
 unnisvin-beesvin shatabdi ke samikshakon ne use 'swatantra chintak shahid' or aadhunik vaigyanik vichaaron kaa udghoshak mana he
 Giordano Bruno was a famous 16th century Italian philosopher, astronomer, mathematician and poet
 unhone khagol vaigyanik nicholas kopernicus ke vichaaron kaa samarthan kiya tha
 That too when people in Europe were blind to religion
 nicholas kopernicus ne kaha tha - 'brahmand kaa centre prithvi nahin, surya he
 ' bruno ne nicholas kopernicus ke vichaaron kaa samarthan karte hue kaha - 'akaash sirf utana nahin he, jitna hamen dikhaai detaa he
 It is infinite and it has innumerable worlds
 ' Bruno's view of religion was that - 'religion is one in which the followers of all religions can openly discuss each other's religion among themselves
 ' Bruno thought that every star has its own family as our solar family

 It also takes into consideration the factors of population subdivision and population structure
 yah anukulan or prajatikaran jaisi avadharanaon kii vyakhya karne kaa bhi prayaas karti he

 Population genetics focuses on the genetic design of populations and the study of how this pattern changes over time
 jansankhya jeevon kaa ek aisa samucchy hoti he, jisamen sadasyon kaa koi bhi samooh aapas main santanotpatti kar saktaa he
 It is implied that all members belong to the same species and live close to each other
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi jangal main rahane vaale ek hi prajati ke sabhi patange ek jansankhya hai
 a gene present in this population may have different alternative forms, which illustrate variations among organisms' phenotypes
 iskaa ek udhaaharan patangon main rang ke nirdhaaran ke liye uttaradaayi ek jin ho saktaa he, jisamen do yugma-vikalpi hote hai: kaala or safed
 kisi ekal jansankhya main ek jin ke liye yugma vikalpiyon kaa sampurna samucchya ek jin-pool kehalaata he; kisi yugma vikalpi ke liye yugma vikalpi aavriti us pool ke jeenon kaa vah bhaag hoti he, jo us yugma vikalpi se milakar bane hon 
 sankaran jeevon kii ek jansankhya ke antargat yugma vikalpiyon kii aavritiyon main parivartan hone par vikaas hota he; udhaaharan ke liye, patangon kii ek jansankhya main kaale rang ke liye uttaradaayi yugma vikalpi adhik aam hota ja rahaa he
 In order to understand the methodology that causes the growth of a population, it is useful to consider what conditions are necessary for the development of a population
 hardi-vinberg siddhant ke anusaar ek paryaapt rup se badi jansankhya main yugma-vikalpiyon kii aavriti sthir bani rahegi, yadi veery yaa andon ke nirmaan ke dauraan yugma-vikalpiyon kii yadrichhik adla-badali, tathaa nishechan ke dauraan in ling koshikaon main un yugma-vikalpiyon kaa yadrichhik sangyojan hi us jansankhya par kaary kar rahi ekmaatr shakti ho
 Such a population is considered to be in the Hardy – Weinberg equivalent because it is not developing
 hardi-vinberg siddhant ke anusaar kisi jansankhya main yugma-vikalpi or genotip aavritiyaan, donon hi peedi-dar-peedi sthir bane rahete hai—arthath ve samatulyata kii sthiti main hote hai—jab tak ki vyavdhaan utpann karne vaale koi vishisht prabhaav inke sampark main na aaen
 prayogshaala ke baahar, in “vyavdhaan utpann karanevaale prabhaavon” main se ek yaa adhik sadaiv prabhavi hote hai
 Hardy Weinberg equivalents are impossible in nature
 anuvaanshik samatulyata vah adarsh sthiti he, jo ek aadhaar-rekha pradaan karti he, jis par anuvaanshik parivartan ko mapa ja sake
 The frequencies of pair-choices in a population remain constant for generations if the following conditions are being observed: random cohabitation, no mutation, no migration or emigration, the sheer size of the population and any symptoms No selective pressure in support or opposition
 do yugma-vikalpiyon vaali kisi ekal jin avasthiti ke saralatam maamle main: prabhaavshaalee yugma-vikalpi ko a dwaara tathaa aprabhavi yugma-vikalpi ko a dwaara suchit kiya jaataa he or unki aavritiyaan p or q dwaara darshai jaati hai; freq = p ; freq = q ; p + q = 1
 yadi jansankhya samatulyata main ho, to hamen jansankhya main AA samayugmakon ke liye freq = p 2, aa samayugmakon ke liye freq = q 2, tathaa vishamyugmakon ke liye freq = 2pq praapt hogi
 Based on these equations, useful, but difficult-to-measure facts about a population can be determined
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek marij kii santan us aprabhavi utparivartan kii vaahak hoti he, jo samayugmak aprabhavi bacchon main sistic fibrosis kaa kaaran banataa he
 Parents want to know how likely their grandchildren are to inherit the disease by inheritance

 It is possible that this fact is not known, but the frequency of the disease is known

 Template: Genetic genealogy jansankhya anuvanshiki ke ganit kaa vikaas multah aadhunik vikasmoolak sanshleshan ke ek bhaag ke rup main hua tha
 According to Betty, it defines the core of modern synthesis
 levontin ke anusaar, jansankhya anuvanshiki kaa saidhantik kaary do antaraalon kii ek prakriya he: ek "genotypic antaraal " or ek "phenotypic antaraal "
 jansankhya anuvanshiki ke ek purna siddhant kii chunauti niyamon kaa ek aisa samucchy pradaan karnaa he, jo genotip vaali ek jansankhya kaa milan phenotip, jahaan chayan kiya jaataa he, ke saath purvanumey rup se kar sake or niyamon ek anya samucchy, jo parinamit jansankhya kaa milan punah genotip ke saath kar sake, jahaan mendeleey anuvanshiki ke dwaara genotipon kii agali peedi kaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he or is tarah chakra puraa ho jaataa he
 For a moment, if we put aside the non-mendelian aspects of molecular genetics, it is clearly a huge task
 is roopantaran ko yojanabaddh rup se dekhne par: Adapted from 1974, page + 12)
 Xd t 1 anuvaanshik or epigenetic niyamon, kaaryaatmak jeevigyaan ke pahaluon, yaa vikaas kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jo ek genotip ko phenotip main roopantarit karte hai
 We will refer to this as a "genotype-phenotype map"
 t 2 prakritik chayan ke kaaran hone vaala roopantaran he, t 3 epigenetic sambandh hai, jo chaynit phenotip ke aadhaar par genotip kaa purvanumaan lagaate hai or antat t 4 mendeleey anuvanshiki ke niyam hai
 In practice, evolutionary theory has two parts, which are parallel to each other, the traditional population genetics employed in the genotype interval and the biometric theory used in breeding of flora and animals, employed in the phenotype interval
 yahaan genotip or phenotip antaraal ke bich kaa maanchitran anupasthit he
 The reason for this is "sleight of hand", whereby variable objects of a region are considered to be criteria or stationary objects, where, in a complete practice, they will be transformed automatically by evolutionary processes and in reality they are transformed into another area
 There are actions that change the state of is "haath kii safai" main yah mana jaataa he ki ham is maanchitran ko jaanate hai
 To assume that we understand this is sufficient to analyze many matters of interest to us
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi phenotip genotip ke saath lagbhag ek-prati-ek ho yaa samay-maap paryaapt rup se sankshipt ho, to "sthir vastuon" ko usee rup main sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he, jis rup main ve maujuud hon; haalanki, anek sthitiyon main aisa karnaa galat bhi hota he
 Natural selection is the process by which hereditary traits that increase the chances of survival and successful reproduction of an organism become more common in subsequent generations of a population
 jeevon kii ek jansankhya ke bheetar prakritik anuvaanshik vividhta kaa arth yah he ki vartmaan vaataavaran main kuch jeev anya jeevon kii tulana main adhik safaltaapurvak jivit bache rahenge yah mudda charles darwin ne langik chayan ke apane vichaaron main viksit kiya ki prajananaatmak safalataa ko prabhavit karne vaale kaarak bhi mahatvapurn hai
 Natural selection works on the phenotype, or on the observable traits of the organism, but the genetic basis of any phenotype, which provides the advantage of reproduction, will become more common in a population
 Over time, this process can result in adaptations to a specific ecological habitat and eventually result in the birth of a new species
 prakritik chayan aadhunik jeev-vigyaan kii aadharshilaon main se ek he
 This new vocabulary was introduced by Charles Darwin in his 1859 unprecedented book On the Origin of Species, which describes natural selection as artificial selection, a process by which animals and flora are systematically introduced to reproduction by traits desired by their human breeders
 Supported by, it was compared with
 multah prakritik chayan kii avadharana kaa vikaas anuvaanshikta ke ek maanya siddhant ke abhaav main hua tha; darwin ke lekhan ke samay, aadhunik anuvanshiki vigyaan ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Modern developmental synthesis is called the mutual combination of discoveries made in Darwinian development and subsequent traditional and molecular genetics
 prakritik chayan anukoolnaatmak vikaas kaa mukhya kaaran bana hua he
 Genetic fallacy is the difference in relative frequency in which another form of a gene arises in a population due to random sampling and opportunity
 arthath, jansankhya main aane vaali pidiyon main upasthit yugma-vikalpi inke abhibhavakon main upasthit yugma-vikalpiyon ke ek yadrichhik sample hote hai
 And opportunity plays a role in determining whether a particular organism will survive and breed
 ek jansankhya kii yugma-vikalpi aavriti kisi vishisht rup ko saajha karne vaale jin yugma-vikalpiyon kii kul sankhya kii tulana main isaki jin pratiyon kaa bhaag yaa pratishat hota he
 Genetic bending is an important developmental process, resulting in changes in pair-alternating frequencies over time
 iske kaaran jin kii koi vividhta purnatah samaapt bhi ho sakati he, jisase anuvaanshik parivartanshiltaa main kami aati he
 In contrast to natural selection, which makes diverse forms of genes more common or less common depending on their success in reproduction, the changes due to genetic predation are not driven by environmental or adaptation pressures, and they tend towards reproductive success
 Can also be profitable, neutral or harmful
 anuvaanshik jhukaav kaa prabhaav choti jansankhya main bada or badi jansankhya main chota hota he
 There is a strong debate among scientists about the importance of genetic predisposition compared to natural selection
 ronaald fisher kaa drushtikon yah he ki anuvaanshik jhukaav vikaas main ek naganya bhoomika nibhaataa he or yahi drushtikon kai dashakon tak prabhavi rahaa he
 In 1968, Motu Kimura revived this debate by the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, which claimed that most changes in genetic material are caused by genetic orientations
 utparivartan ek koshika ke jinom ke diene kram main hone vaale parivartan hai or ye vikiran, vishaanuon, transposon or utparivartak rasayanon tathaa saath hi miyosis yaa diene pratilipikaran ke dauraan utpann hone vaali trutiyon ke kaaran hote hai
 Errors often occur during the process of DNA replication, in the polymerization of other fibers
 ye trutiyaan swayan jeev dwaara bhi ati-utparivartan jaisi koshikeey prakriyaaon dwaara utpann kii ja saktin hai
 Mutations can have an effect on the phenotype of an organism, particularly if they are generated within the protein coding sequence of a gene
 diene polimrez kii “prufreeding” kshamta ke kaaran trutiyon kii dar saamanytah bahut kam hoti he
 Without proofreading, the rates of errors are a thousand times higher than this
 diene main hone vaali rasinic kshati prakritik rup se bhi hoti he or koshikaayen diene main is tuutan or galat milaanon ko sudhaarney ke liye diene sudhaar kaarividhi kaa prayog karti he
 Despite this, sometimes this correction fails to return the DNA to its original sequence
 diene kii adla-badali karne or jeenon ko punah sanyojit karne ke liye gunasutreey badlaav kaa prayog karne vaale jeevon main, miyosis ke dauraan sanrekhan main hone vaali trutiyon ke kaaran bhi utparivartan ho sakate hai
 Errors in change are most likely to occur when similar sequences force their participial properties to adopt a misalignment; This causes certain regions of the genome to become more susceptible to such mutations
 ye trutiyaan diene kram main bade sanrachanaatmak badlaav utpann karti hai—sampurna kshetra kaa doharaav, utkraman yaa vilopan, athwa vibhinn gun-sutron ke bich puure bhaagon kii galati se adla-badali ho janaa 
 Mutations can cause many different types of changes in the DNA sequence; It is possible that they have no effect, or that they change the product of a gene or that it stops the gene from functioning
 drosophila melanogaster naamak makkhi par kiye gayi adhyayan main yah gyaat hua ki yadi koi utparivartan ek jin dwaara utpann kisi protein ko parivartit karata he, to sambhawatah yah hanikaarak hoga kyonki is utparivartan ke lagbhag 70 pratishat bhaag kaa prabhaav hanikaarak hoga or shesh bhaag yaa to tatasth hoga athwa bahut hi kam laabhadaayak hoga
 Due to the potentially harmful effects of these mutations on cells, organisms have developed procedures such as DNA correction to remove the mutations
 atah prajatiyon ke bich utparivartan kii ishtatam dar ucch utparivartan dar, jaise kshatikar utparivartan, kii laagton or utparivartan dar ko kam karne ke liye pranaaliyon, jaise diene sudhaar kinvakon, ke rakh-rakhaav kii chayapachayee laagton ke bich hoti he
 Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have high mutation rates, which may be of benefit as these viruses will evolve continuously and rapidly and thus evade the protective response of the human immune system, for example
 
 utparivartan main diene ke bade bhaagon kaa doharaav shaamil ho saktaa he, jo ki saamanytah anuvaanshik punarsangyojan ke madhyam se hota he
 These repeats are a major source of raw material for the creation of new genes and tens to hundreds of genes are transcribed into the animal genome every million years
 adhikansh jin saajha vansh ke jeenon ke bade pariwaron ke sadsy hote hai
 New genes are produced by various methods, usually through duplication and mutation of an ancestral gene, or by creating new combinations that perform new functions by recombining parts of different genes
 yahaan, kshetra khandon ke rup main kaary karte hai, jinamein se prayek kaa ek vishisht or swatantra kaary hota he or jinhen aapas main milakar naye gunon ke saath naye protein ko kutabaddh karne vaale jin utpann kiye ja sakate hai
 For example, the human eye uses four genes to form a structure that recognizes light: three for color vision and one for night vision; These four originate from the same ancestor gene
 ek jin kii pratilipi banane kaa ek anya laabh yah he ki isse atirek badhata he; yah yugma ke ek jin ko naye kaary ko apnaane kii anumati detaa he, jabaki anya pratilipi mul kaary jari rakhti he
 Other types of mutation often create new genes from previously untreated DNA
 jin pravaah jansankhyaon, jo ki aksar samaan prajatiyaan hotin hai, ke bich jeenon kii adla-badali he
 Examples of gene flow between similar species include migration of organisms and subsequent breeding, or interchange of pollen
 prajatiyon ke bich jin sthanantaran main sankar jeevon kaa nirmaan or kshaitij jin sthanantaran shaamil hai
 Migration within or outside the population may change the frequency of pair-choices and also introduce new genetic variations in the population
 apravasana kisi jansankhya ke jin pool main naye anuvaanshik padaarth jod saktaa he
 Emigration by contrast can remove genetic material
 chunki jansankhyaon kii nai prajatiyon ke nirmaan ke liye do chhitari hui jansankhyaon ke bich prajnan ke prati avarodhon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jin pravaah jansankhyaon ke bich anuvaanshik antar failaakar is prakriya ko dhimaa kar saktaa he
 Mountain-chains, oceans and deserts or even man-made structures, such as the Great Wall of China, which inhibited the flow of genes of vegetation, inhibit gene flow
 is aadhaar par ki do prajatiyaan apane sabase haalia aam purvaj se kitni dur hat gayi hai, apni santan utpann karnaa unke liye abhi bhi sambhav ho saktaa he, jaise ghodon or gadhon ke bich prajnan se khachchar utpann hote hai
 Generally such hybrid organisms are infertile because two different sets of properties are not able to form pairs during meiosis
 In this case, closely related species may hybridize regularly, but hybrids will be selected to the contrary and the species will remain distinct
 However, sometimes hybrid hybrids are also produced, and these new species have intermediate properties to their parent species, or they have completely new phenotypes
 pashuon kii nai prajatiyon ke nirmaan main sankaran kaa mahatv aspasht he, haalanki, iske maamle anek prakaar ke pashuon main dekhe jate rahe hai, or grey tree mendhak iskaa ek vishisht udhaaharan he, jiskaa bahut acchhee tarah adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Hybridization is, however, an important means of characterization in flora, as polyploidy is more accepted by flora than animals
 poliploidi sankaranon main mahatvapurn he kyonki yah aise prajnan kii anumati detaa he, jisamen miyosis ke dauraan gunasutron ke do bhinn samucchyon main se prayek ek samroop sahabhaagi ke saath jodi banane main sakasham hota he
 Polyploid organisms also have greater genetic diversity, due to which they can survive the pressure of interbreeding in small populations
 kshaitij jin sthanantaran ek jeev se kisi duusare aise jeev main anuvaanshik saamagree kaa sthanantaran he, jo uski santan na ho; yah jeevanuon main sabase aam he
 In medicine, it contributes to the expansion of resistance to antibiotics because when a bacterium acquires resistant genes, it can rapidly transfer them to another species
 jeevanuon se eukeriot jeevon, jaise khamir seceromices serevisi or aazuki been bhanvare calosobrukas chinensis tak jeenon kaa kshaitij sthanantaran bhi hua hoga
 An example of large-scale transfers is the eukaryotic dalloid rotifer, which probably inherited a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and flora
 vishaanu bhi jeevon ke bich diene le ja sakate hai, jisase jaivik kshetron ke bich bhi jeenon kaa sthanantaran hota he
 Large-scale gene transfer can also occur between eukaryotic cells and prokaryote organisms during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria
 ek jansankhya se duusari main yugma-vikalpiyon ke sthanantaran ko jin pravaah kehete hai
 Migration within or outside a single population may be responsible for a characteristic change in allele frequencies
 apravasana ke parinamswaroop bhi kisi vishisht prajati yaa jansankhya ke sthapit jin pool main naye anuvaanshik bhinn-rup jud sakate hai
 There are several factors affecting the rate of gene flow between different populations
 sarvaadhik mahatvapurn karkon main se ek he gatishiltaa, kyonki jeev kii gatishiltaa jitani adhik hogi, uski pravaasana sambhaavna bhi utani hi adhik hogi

 And he said, "yes, we will change, there is no problem"
 After that, you know what happened? Belestre ordered that it not be changed
 i know how the system works and i realized that it was undesirable 
 isliye maine apane aap se kaha, "thik he, chaahe jo bhi ho, main pehle corner kaa pehla pojishan lene ja rahaa hum - main us khilaadi ko us corner main mujhase pehle aane dene ke liye taiyaar nahin tha
 If i am close enough to him, he can never turn in front of me, he will have to let me go
 "I didn't care if we collided; i was ready for it

 And the result of which was the first Corner incident

 Prost later called the Army's activities "disgusting" and said that he should seriously consider retiring from the sport after the incident

 unhone mahasoos kiya ki macleran car pehle kii tulana main kam pratiyogi thi 
 It would have been impossible for Williams to join Williams with Prost, as a clause in Prost's contract was prohibited as an Army team-member, yet Sena offered to drive for free

 From the surface of Mars, the movements of Phobos and Demos appear to be quite different from our own moon
 phobose pashchim main udai hota he, purv main ast hota he or maatr 11 ghante baad phir se udit hota he
 There is a slightly outward synchronous orbit of the dimose, that is, its orbital period corresponds to its rotation period, as it rises in the east but very slowly

 Since Phobos' orbit is below synchronous altitude, tidal forces from Mars are gradually shortening its orbit
 lagbhag 5 karod varsh main yah yaa to mangal kii sataha main durghatnagrast ho jayega yaa grah ke chaaron ore challe ke rup main tuutakar bikhar jayega
 The origins of both moons are not well understood, due to the low albedo and carbonized condrite structure that is thought to be similar to an asteroid, which supports the theory of grabbing
