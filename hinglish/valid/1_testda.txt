 Odyssey bc Written in the eighth century
 yah kahan likhi gai is sambandh main mana jaataa he ki yah is samay ke yunaan adhikrut main sagar tat ionia main likhi gai jo ab turki kaa bhaag he
 Odesi tells the saga of the daring deeds that occur when returning to the homeland after the Battle of Troy, a mythological hero named Odes or Ulysse
 jis prakaar hindu ramayana main lanka vijay kii kahani padhakar aanandit hote hai
 Similarly, the story of the Greek hero Ulysses in the Odyssey is delightful
 try kaa rajkumaar sparta kii rani hellen kaa apharan kar try nagar le gaya
 To avenge this insult, all the kings and heroes of Greece invaded Troy
 par na nagar kaa phatak tutaa or na pracheer hi laanghi ja saki
 Finally the Greek army did a trick
 ek lakdi kaa khokhla ghoda pahiayukt patle par jadaa gaya
 Leaving him, they returned from their ships
 troy ke logon ne sochaa ki unani apane devtaa kii murti chhodkar niraash ho chale gaye
 When they pulled it to the city, the archway of the main gate had to be cut
 raatri ko jab troy khushiyon manaa rahaa tha, khokhli ashv murti se unani sainikon ne nikalakar chupchaap troy kaa phatak khol diya
 The Greek army, which did not go back but hid nearby, entered Troy
 ek hellen ke peeche troy nasht ho gaya thik vaise hi jaise sita ke peeche ravan kii swarnamayi lanka nasht hui thi
 This created the phrase 'the Trojan Horse' in English
 ‘odesi’ manishi greek captain odesus kii saahasik vaapasi yatra kii gaatha he
 While returning from Troy, his ship fell into a storm
 vah bahut dinon tak idhar udhar bhatakta rahaa

 This story is told in twenty-four sergos, in which canto continued to suffer and wander due to the wrath of warrior Odesius Varuna for ten years after the war in one
 is kshtmay kaal ke antim bhaag main katha prarambh hoti he
 In canto four, Telemakus meets Minilas and Helen

 Odesius said when the war of war ended, on the way to the home we invaded the Syconies, were defeated

 Finally, we reached the land of Lotus - this lotus is a sweet plant, due to which our sailors were engulfed in utter bliss
 jabardastee unhen ghasitkar pot par laayaa gaya
 Then later we reached the land of a Nayavan demons and were imprisoned in the cave of a demon by our foolishness

 Canto thirteen describes the management of Odesian's visit by the Athetya king

 Canto 24 is the story of the evil Kumari's souls in Adhumalok or their relatives, the plan of war and the beginning and end of war and peace and peace
 odisi 24 anuvaakon main vibhakt he or iskaa ghatnakaal 42 din kaa he
 In the initial verse, the guardian of Odysseus at the assembly of the gods complains to Athena Zeus that Odysseus left Troy 10 years ago but has not yet reached home; Because, a demon named Calypso detains him in an island called Augizia, while Pinatapi's gatherers in Ithaca are not only creating hustle but also looting Odysseus' property
 jiyas ethina ko yathavivek kaary karne kii anumati de detaa he or vah odisius ke putr telemacas ke sanmukh menter ke rup main upasthit hokar use paraamarsh detii he ki vah apane ghar main pinalopi ke panigrahathiyon kaa pravesh roak de tathaa swayan apane pita kaa pataa lagane ke liye yatra kare
 In the second, third and fourth paragraphs, the story of Telemacus is played
 telemacas ek sabha kaa aayojan kar usamen pinalopi ke panigrahalarthiyon kii bhartsana karata he or menter rupi ethina kii sahaayta se ek jahaaj praapt karke apni maan ko bataae bina hi yatra par chal padataa he
 Along with Mentor, he reaches Pilos and meets the old Nestor where he learns the true details of the Trajan War
 pilos se vah sparta jaataa he
 There, i meet Helen's wife Helen and prepare to return home
 uske turant baad kavi ethaka sthit odisius ke prasaad kii ghatnaayen prastut karata he
 On one hand Pinlopi is troubled by his son's sudden disappearance, and on the other hand his entourage sends a ship under the supervision of Antinus to the port, arranging that Telemacus be killed as soon as he returns so that Odysseus' possessions and his occupation of Pinelopi Possible paanchaven anuvaak main pun: devataaon kii sabha kaa drishy he jisamen ethina ek baar phir odisius kii mukti kaa praytn karti he
 Zeus sends Hermes to Calypso, and at her insistence, she makes a raft of trees and sends Odysseus to Ithaca
 17 din tak taron kii sahaayta se yatra karne ke baad jaise hi odisius fiaisia dweep ke nikat pahunchataa he, samudr ke devtaa posidon ke krodh ke kaaran uskaa bedaa tut jaataa he or vah laharon main doobane utaraate lagata he
 Then Leucothia, the nymph of the sea, gives him a mortal handkerchief with the help of which he finally reaches Fiacia
 chathe anuvaak main fiaisia ke raja elsinas kii beti nausika swapn main ethina se aadesh paakar agali subah samudratat par apane kapade dhone jaati he jahaan uski bhent nange odisius se hoti he
 In the seventh verse, she brings him home with his clothes on
 aathven anuvaak main raja elsinas darbar main odisius kaa swaagat karata he
 On this occasion, Bhat sings a Trajan-war-related song, and Odysseus starts to cry distracted
 raja usase rone kaa kaaran poochta he to odisius ko apana vaastavik parichay dena padataa he
 In the next three passages, everyone recounts his 10-year thrilling journey after the fall of Odysseytrae
 12wein anuwak main odiciamas fiaisia ke jaadui jahaaj par ethaka pahunchataa he jahaan ethina ek gaderiye ke rup main usase milti he or use bhikhaari ke rup main parivartit kar detii he taaki uski patni ke panigrahanarthi use pahachaanakar koi haani na pahunchaa saken
 In the 13th verse, Athena dispatches Odysseus to his suitor and goes to Sparta himself, and orders Telemacus to return to Ithaca quickly
 14wein anuvaak main odisius tathaa shookarpal kii baatcheet he
 In the 15th episode, Telemacus escapes the conspiracy of his mother's entreaties and returns home safely
 16wein anuvaak main telemacas shookarpal ke ghar main apane pita ko pahchaan letaa he
 Later, the father plans to get rid of Pinelupi's diacritics
 17wein tathaa 18wein anuvaak main bhikshukveshi odisius apane prasaad main pahunchataa he jahaan uskaa purana kutta ergas use pahachaanakar khushi ke maare dam tod detaa he
 At the same time, Odysseus sees the rationale of Pinlopi's attendants in the palace, which also makes the proper role of his terrible act of killing them later
 19wein anuvaak main odisia tathaa pinalopi kii aamane saamne baatcheet hoti he parantu pinalopi apane pati ko pahchaan nahin paati, jabaki uski puraani dhai uriclia uske pair main bachapan main bane kshatchihn ko dekhakar use pahchaan jaati he
 In the 20th verse, Odysseus wakes up overnight thinking of many things due to anger
 21 wein anuvaak main pinalopi apane panigrahanarthiyon ko chunauti detii he ki ve sab pari pari odisius ke dhanush kaa chilla chadhaakar is tarah tir chalaaen ki vah vishaal vriksh main tange 12 chhallon ke bich se nikal jaae
 All fail, but the beggar Odysseus shoots arrows from between the rings
 22 wein anuvaak main mahakavy kaa charmotkarsh he
 Odysseus kills all of Pinloopy's diacritics with arrows
 koi bhi ek, bachakar nikal nahin paata, kyonki vishaal kaksh ke sabhi daravaajein pehle hi band kar die gaye the 23wein anuvaak main pinalopi apane pati ko pahachaanati he or donon ke milan kaa hridaygrahi evam marmasparshi drishy saamne aata he
 In the last or 24th chapter of the Maha Kavya, which some critics consider to be a projectile, the angel Mercury carries the souls of all the descendants of Pinloopy to the lower and infested regions of hell where they are given various kinds of tragic punishments
 isi bich odisius nagar ke baahar kheton main jaakar apane pita larties se miltaa he
 Finally, there is a grand feast to commemorate Odysseus's return home and the script concludes with information that ithaka is established
 elliod kaa kathanak mahaj 50 dinon kaa he - dasven varsh ke antim do maas ke andar kii ghati ghatnaayen
 If the plot had started from the beginning of the story, it should have started with the coincidence of Lida and Hans
 par homer katha ke antim bhaag ko pakadta he
 In between, he refers to the earlier story, not even in a sequence
 greek shrotasmaj ko katha pehle hi se gyaat he
 With this he does not know any difficulty, otherwise the first part of the story will be clear to an unknown person only once he recites the entire poem
 iliyat ke bare main duusari baat yah dhyaan main rakhane kii he ki uskaa vishay jaisaa ki mangalacharan se spasht he, ekiles ke krodh kaa gaan he
 Where this anger ends after its peak
 usase kuch aage tak, arthath is krodh ke pratyaksh fal petraclus kii mrityu evam apratyaksh fal hectares kii mrityu tak, chalakar katha samaapt ho jaati he par ekiles kii mrityu, try kaa dhwans aadi is mahakavy main nahin aate hai
 Homer keeps 'too The Point' very strictly on the theme declared in his epic - not a little bit
 is ghor sanyam kaa hi parinaam he katha-yaa ‘vishay kii ekta’ 
 Each event is seated within the entire design with tightly related associations
 bhartiya mahakavyon main isi ekta evam sangati kaa abhaav he evam sara dhaanchaa dhili-dhaali katha vyavastha se purna he
 The subject of Valmiki's Ramayana is Polastyavadh, but the events involved in it are connected with very loose sources
 mahabharat main to yah ‘ekta’ bilkul nahin - vah to vishwakosh kii style main likhaa gaya he
 In Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas, it is definitely like 'jatiili Ekta' and 'associative consistency' like Homer
 jahaan tak vishay kii ekta evam prabhavanviti kaa prashn he tulsidas kii samta koi bhi bhartiya kavi, chaahe vah kalidas hi kyon na ho, nahin kar saktaa
 This thing is being written here in Abhidhartha
 homer ekiles ke krodh evam uske vikaas kaa pratifal evam varnan 9 sargon main karata he or katha ko uske pratyaksh, apratyaksh falon tak le jaakar samaapt karata he
 If he had been tempted to narrate further events, till the death of the Achilles and the ruin, then there would not have been a strong structural unity in poetry
 dhaanchaa dhilaa ho jaataa
 Aristotle praised Homer's genius in those chapters of 'poetics' and taught Homer to emulate his ideal, where he discusses the 'three Unities' and influences
 greek sahitya main dhaanchaa par bahut hi adhik jor diya gaya he
 This form is evident in the geometric consistency of the law, their sculpture, theatrical etc
 unhone chand ko bhavanubhuti evam alankaar se kam mahatva nahin diya
 This trend is not only present in Homer, but in Homer itself
 elliod main sara ‘acshan’ vrittakar he
 Where it starts, it comes and ends there
 jin sanskaron ne greek tragedy ko dhaanchaa evam bhavbhumi pradaan kii, ve sanskaar greekon kii jaateey nidhi hai or ve hi homer kii pratibha main bhi praan sthaapan karte hai
 From this there is a structural and emotional similarity in the tragedy literature of Homer and Kalantar
 greek tragedy ke dhaanche kaa sanyaman teen tatva - ‘ek desh’, ‘ek kaal’, evam ‘ek vyapaar yaa vishay’-karte hai
 In the Iliad, the 'country' is the same, that is, the whole event takes place on the palaces of Troy and the beach in front
 ‘kaal’ bhi ek hi he, kyonki mahakavy kaa ghatnasutra lagaataar 50 din kii avadhi kaa he
 That is, a continuous unbroken form of 'kaal' is given - by holding the last 50 days of the 10th year
 kavyavrutt ko 10 varshon kii sataha par na failaakar vah 50 dinon ke andar hi samet letaa he
 The trade or subject is also the same - the anger of Echiles, its mitigation and its fruit in the form of epilogue
 bas, yaheen mahakavy samaapt ho jaataa he
 The subject of Odyssey is broad
 mahakavy kaa nayak odesius try yuddh ke baad 10 varsh tak bhatakta rahaa
 This epic also begins with the last part of this decade
 dhaanchaa thik elliod jaisaa he
 In the 50-day event of the Iliad, the present is the predominance - the purpose of the poet is to describe what happened in those 50 days
 purv kii ghatnaayen raah chalati charchaa-si kahin-kahin aa jaati hai
 But this is not the case in Odessa
 odesi kaa vishay hi he ‘odesius kaa dukhamay bhraman’
 Therefore, this is the aim of this 10-year tour
 vah elliod kii tarah hi dashak ke antim chor par prarambh hota he avashya, parantu uskaa uddeshy ‘vartmaan’ se adhik ‘ateet’ se sambandhit he
 Homer therefore uses flashback-technics of modern films
 mahakavy kaa armbh hota he 10wein varsh main, jab odesius apsara kelipso ke dweep se yatra shuru karata he or uskaa bhagn pot dub jaataa he evam vah nasika ke desh main bahakar lag jaataa he
 The king of there narrates the Ram story of his 9 years in canto from 9 to 12
 ‘purv-smriti’ takanic isi 9wein se 12wein sargon main he
 But even in the womb of this former memory, there is the 'antecedent memory' in the 11th canto, when he narrates the balance of the story of the war of triumphs to Aciles
 odesi kaa kaal sanghathan bada hi pechida he
 In the womb of 'present', 'east' and in the womb of that East lies 'ante'
 samooche kaal-bandh ko ‘mukul-patr-bandh’ kii sangya di ja sakati he
 In the bud, there is a second layer inside a layer of petals, a third layer lies inside the second
 usee bhanti odesi kaa kaal-bandh he
 This time-bound duality becomes complicated because the 'country' of Odyssey is not one
 odesi kaa vishay he, ‘bhayankar samudr-bhraman evam guhaagaman’
 Hence, the centers of trade become two
 ek to he ithaika jahaan uski rani pinilopi uski pratiksha main baithi he or uske putr-kaltr uske shatruon se ghire hai
 The second is Odessa's own and its floating position on the sea surface
 in do ‘deshon’ ke ghatnaon sanchaalan hota he mahaan sutaradhar zeeyas dwaara
 Even if there is no 'unity of the country', the unity of the subject or business exists in the same truncated way as in the 'iliad'
 kavi badi saavdhaanee se ek ghatana kii parat main duusari ghatana rakhkar samooche vyapaar kii sangati evam sudaulata kii raksha badi dhirta se karata he
 The content of the Iliad is limited
 isi se tragedy kaa pattern baith gaya
 Unity of work-effect was achieved very easily
 parantu ‘odesi’ kaa vishay vistrut he
 It is like a novel
 phir bhi itani saavdhaanee se kaary evam prabhaav kii ekta sampadit kii gayi he ki aaj ke style-pradhan yaa rup-pradhan upanyaas bhi uske saamne fike pad jate hai
 For a beginning poet - for a beginner, such a great workmanship is a matter of surprise
 sankshep main elliod kaa roopayan tragediparak he evam odesi kaa upanyasparak
 Despite this, Odyssey is parallel to the Iliad in many respects
 elliod or odesi donon kaavyon kaa armbh kathakaal kii antim chor pakadakar hota he
 The end of both is also on the subject declared in the beginning
 donon kii gati-rekha vrittakar he
 The number of cantos in both is 24
 elliod ke ant main hectares kaa nidhan he to odesi main paani-praarthi rajkumaron kaa
 At the end of the Iliad, a peaceful atmosphere, perfect for a period of time, is present in which both sides cremate the dead
 odesi main to ant main priyamilan evam sthaayee shaanti aa jaati he
 The characters in both the epics are known to be cast in the same scale and mold
 anthoni jis kutilata or tatparta se greek yoddhaon kii sahaayta elliod main karti he usee rup main odesi main bhi
 Poseidon is both a cruel and foolish deity
 odesius donon mahakavyon main saahsee, vir, krurkarma evam kutil rup main chitrit he
 Minilas is similarly rich, generous heart warrior in both epics
 budhimhan vruddh nestor kaa mitra bhi vahiin rahata he
 If the authors of these epics were different then there would have been a difference in the portrayal of the characters
 udhaaharan ke liye homer kaa ‘diomidil’ yaa ‘afroditi’ virgil ke diomedij yaa afroditi se bilkul alag hai
 The same pattern of plot and characters suggests that both poems are abandoned by the talent of the same person
 bharat kii janaganana anusaar yah gaanv, tehsil kanth, jila muradabad, uttar pradesh main sthit he

 ashtadhaatu, ek mishratu he jo hindu or jain pratimaaon ke nirmaan main prayukt hoti he
 The eight metals with which they are made are: - Gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, tin, iron, and mercury are counted
 ek pracheen granth main inkaa nirdesh is prakaar kiya gaya he: Golden silver copper color Yashdamev Ch
 shisn lohan rasascheti dhatvoshtau prakirtita:
 Seeing only the instructions of the first seven metals in Sushruta Samhita, it appears that Sushruta is not in favor of considering mercury as metal, but this fantasy is not right
 unhone anyatra ras ko bhi dhaatu mana he 
 Ashtadhatu was also used to construct the statue
 tab ras ke sthaan par pital kaa grahan samajhnaa chahie; bhavishyapurana ke ek vachan ke aadhaar par hemaadri kaa aisa nirnay he
 According to astrology, every metal has its inherent energy, if the metals are worn at the right time and by looking at the right position of the planets, then they get positive effect, otherwise the metal also gives the opposite effect
 Ashtadhatu is a very auspicious metal for Hindus
 pracheen kaal se hi ashtadhaatu kaa upyog pratimaa nirmaan main bhi hota rahaa he
 Ashtadhatu was also used for the construction of the statue
 Apart from this, Ashtadhatu was also used to wear the gemstone, if Rahu is in an inauspicious position in your horoscope then it is particularly painful, in that too it can give very painful side effects in the great condition and condition of Rahu in the right hand
 Wearing Ashtadhatu's hardness is definitely beneficial as well as chanting and donating Rahu in consultation with a qualified astrologer
 Docile provides relief
 ashtadhaatu ke dushprinaam Nowadays, less people wear any thing made of Ashtadhatu such as hard, ring because Ashtadhatu lead, mercury, it is also made by mixing metal which is a main cause of cancer disease, so the use of Ashtadhatu has reduced in today's time
 Are lekin panchadhaatu main lead or paara ke alaava koi or dhaatu jaise loha, nikal or rhodium aadi milakar ashtadhaatu banaai jaati hai jo kii galat he wo utana asar nahi karata he | During the construction of toilets in Nalanda district in the year 2017, the statue of Ashtadhatu came out in the excavation of the land
 This statue is of Vishnu whose length is more than about five feet
 isaki keemat antarrashtriya bazaar main kareeb do karores rupaye aanki gai he
 During the excavation, hundreds of villagers gathered near the statue of Lord Vishnu to see him and started worshiping
 vahin suchana milte hi police prashasan ne pahunch kar pratimaa ko apane kabje main le liya | Ashtadhatu is not more durable than Panchadhatu, so even people wear less
 Yes, nowadays many temples in South India have idols made of Ashtadhatu which people worship, they are considered very impressive
 thos-avasthaa-electraniki kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti kaa parivartan evam niyantran se sambandhit gyaan ko shakti electronic kehete hai
 There have been revolutionary changes in the field of electrical energy due to power electronics
 aaj 10 wat se lekar kai sau megawatt ke motaron ko chalaane ke liye drive uplabdh hai
 Electric power up to 6 GW can be transmitted via high-voltage DC transmission of about 1000 kw

 Nowadays, the use of switches like SCR, GTO, BJT, MOSFET, IGBT, etc
 is done very efficiently
 is kaaran shakti electronic kaa kshetra bahut vyapak evam mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Electronics is the department of science in which electric power is efficiently converted to the desired voltage, frequency, current by using electron tubes or semiconductor devices performing similar functions
 vastav main baat yah he ki vidyut shakti hame jis rup main main praapt hoti he usee rup main vah bahut kam upyog main laayi jaati he
 For example, an industry receives electric power in the form of 415 volts, 50 Hz AC
 use vidyutlepan karnaa he jiske liye 0 se 20 volt disi chaiye jisamen se shunya se lekar 1200 ampir dhara bahegi
 It is clear that the power we are getting cannot be directly used for this work, rather it will have to be changed
 yah kaam shakti electraniki dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In fact, there are thousands of examples where electric power cannot be used as it is, rather it has to be changed to some other form
 electraneey yuktiyon main se mahatvapurn upyog ye hai : Many of today's most modern devices also cannot be made without electronics, such as radio, television, movies, fluorescence light, public lecture-system, telephone etc
 ye sab yuktiyaan electraniki kii hi dein hai
 Some of the industrial uses of electronics are briefly mentioned below: udyogon main bahudhaa rujukarak upyog main laae jate hai, jinase prayavarti vidyut-dhara nirdisht dhara main badali jaati he
 They are often of one of the following types: adhik shakti ke rujukari main bahukala rujukari paripathon kaa upyog ekkala rujukari paripathon ke upyog kii upeksha anek kaarnon se adhik laabhadaayak hota he
 The first reason is that nowadays electric power is produced and distributed in the form of tri-art-power
 dwitiya kaaran yah he ki bahukala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata ekkala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata kii apeksha adhik sam hoti he
 In the above mentioned high power loan, either the same loan is kept for many moneylenders or many money bankers, whose loan lines are connected, are used

 a sight-current generator is driven by this motor; It produces a voltage proportional to its speed
 yadi vah voltata purvanishchit voltata se bhinn hoti he to ek niamak ko sakriy kar detii he
 This regulator brings about such a change in the area of the exciter that the current of the motor falls to a predetermined value
 is niamak main anek naliyon kaa upyog hota he
 Thus with the help of electronics, the speed of the motor can be controlled to a minimum value

 samudaay ke bheetar ek nishchit saamaajik padanukram hota he jo ek sadsy kii saamaajik sthiti or dusron par uske prabhaav se nirdhaarit hota he
 Chimpanzees live in a lower hierarchy in which more than one member can be effective enough to dominate other members of lower rank
 It usually has an dominant male member known as alpha mell
 alpha mail sarvocch-ranking vaala nar sadsy hota he jo samooh par niyantran rakhata he or kisi bhi vivaad ke dauraan vyavastha ko banaae rakhata he
 In a chimpanzee society, the 'dominant male' is not always the largest or most powerful male, rather this member is the most manipulative and political male who can influence the activities going on within a group
 nar chimpanji aam taur par apana varchasv aise mitra banaakar hasil karata he jo shakti ke liye us sadsy kii bhavishya kii mahatvakankshaon ke maamle main sahaayta pradaan karegaa
 Demonstrating an attempt to show strength and gain recognition from others is in the character of a male chimpanzee which may be fundamentally necessary to maintain its social status
 alpha nar apni shakti par pakad or adhikaar ko banaae rakhane ke prayaas main anya sadasyon ko dhamkaane ke liye apane aakaar ko bada or daraavna dikhaane or jitna adhik sambhav ho apni shakti kaa pradarshan karne ke liye aksar apni saamaanya rup se patali khaalon ko phula kar motaa kar lete hai
 Lower-grade chimpanzees show respect by making obedient gestures in body language or by grunting out their hands
 maadaa chimpanji apane putthon ko pesh kar alpha nar ke prati apni adheenta kaa pradarshan karti hai
 Female chimpanzees also have a hierarchy that is influenced by a female's individual position within a group

 The Special Marriage Act, 1954 is an Act of the Parliament of India which provides a special form of marriage for the people of India and all Indian citizens in foreign countries, irrespective of religion or belief of either party
 yah adhinium 1 9veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main prastaavit kanoon ke ek tukade se hua tha
 Serious marriages are not governed by personal laws under the Special Marriage Act
 1872 adhinium III main, 1872 ko adhiniyamit kiya gaya tha lekin baad main ise kuch vaanchit sudhaaron ke liye aparyaapt paaya gaya, or sansad ne ek nayaa kanoon banaaya
 Henry Sumner Maine first introduced Act III of 1872, which would allow any dissenters to marry, which he has chosen under a new civil marriage law
 antim shabd main, kanoon ne apane vishwaas ke peshey ko tyaagane ke icchhuk logon ke liye vivaah ko vaid banane kii maang kii

 The Maharshi has made use of this book to clearly demonstrate his intention towards Veda and Vedarth
 maharishi ne satyarth-prakaash ko jahaan multah hindi main likhaa he, vahiin rigvedadibhashyabhumika ko sanskrit main
 Although the Maharshi has tried to express the thematic attitude in Hindi as well, but many a times: lack of consistency is visible in them
 maharishi katipay sthalon par aisa anubhav karte hai ki jo vachaneey tha vah sanskrit main kah diya he, atah ukt vishay ko punah hindi main kehane kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he

 Designing engineering systems by studying and using systems and biological methods found in nature is called bionics or bionics
 ise biomimicry, biomimetics, bio-inspiration, biognosis aadi bhi kehete hai
 In simple words, when we think of bionics, we usually think of artificial arms and legs which can be applied from outside in the human body or think of such sensitive devices which were planted in crippled human body
 is
 “bionix” naamak paddati ke tahat anivaary jivan vyavasthaaon ko motaron va samvedansheel upkarnon se shakti milti he
 They send some messages from damaged organs of human to the brain so that humans can do their work to some extent themselves
 ek aisi sthiti main jab kisi maanav kaa durbhaagya se sharir kaa koi bhi hissaa kshatigrast ho jaae athwa puri tarah se nishkray ko jaae to uske paas kya upaay rah jayega? durbhaagya se hamaare paas chhipakali yaa star machhlee jaisi kshamtaayen nahin hai ki ham dubaara se wo baaju, taang, aadi viksit kar saken tathaa dubaara se use puraane rup main laa saken
 The test being done in the area of "stam Cell" may be its remedy
 par abhi is paddati kaa itnaa vikaas nahin hua he
 Therefore, nothing can be said with certainty about it
 tab tak sirf kritrim ang hi aashaa kii kiran ho sakati hai or yaheen par bionix drishy main aata he
 History of Bionics History of Bionics is very ancient
 puranic kathaon main bhi ullekh he ki kis tarah sipaahi apane kshatigrast angon ke badale lohe ke ang laga kar ran-bhoomi main yuddh karne chale jaaya karte the
 But in today's context, a lot of science and technology has been combined, such as robotics, bio-engineering and megs, so that small things can be taken into consideration in the creation of artificial organs and with human cells Can do his work
 chikitsa or electronic, dono hi kshetron main, laghu-rup vidyut angon, parishkrut sooksham chipon or viksit computer yojanaon ke rup main jo sabhi nirbal maanav sharir ko sabal banane main prayog main aa rahi hai
 This specific human-machine relationship for which the name "bionic body" is appropriate has shown humans with physical disabilities to live a better life by artificial limbs, artificial muscles, earplugs, and other organs
 
 kritrim maans-peshiyaan manushya kaa sharir maans-peshiyon ke abhaav main haddiyon kaa jhulata hua dhaanchaa hi prathit hoga
 This idea is creepy
 to kya maans-peshiyon ke abhaav main nai maans-peshiyon kaa vikaas hona sambhav he? ek raah he - i
e
pi yaa “electroactive paulimur” ke prayog se
 It is often known as artificial muscles and is being used by researchers to tame human deformities
 “nasa” prayogshaala ke yosaf baar kohan is shodh main sabase aage hai
 They have done many experiments and come to the conclusion that these polymers react in the same way as normal muscles under the influence of electricity
 atah maanav sharir main inke prayog par shodh chal rahaa he or bhavishya main inke prayog kii ore zyada sambhaavna he
 Artificial heart Our heart is like an engine for our body pumping blood to our various organs and giving them life
 agar yah dil hi ruk jaae to? dil par kritrim vikaas 1950 ke aas-paas armbh hua jab “pas maikar” kaa parichay hua jisane dil kii bimaari se grast logon ko thodi raahat di
 Today's "money-macers" have become very small
 takneekee paribhaasha ke anusaar “pas-maikar” choti-choti vidyut kirane dil ko bhejtaa he tathaa dil ke dhadakanon kii gati ko sugathit karata he jabaki ek chikitsak “pas-maikar” ke software ko niyantrit karata he
 In case of any problem, he gets the message and he corrects it
 parantu ab puraa hi kritrim dil sambhav he
 The "ABCORE" heart developed by ABOMED has been planted in a large number of patients and the effort has been successful to a large extent
 kuch marijon main yah jivan avadhi chah maah tak badhaane main safal rahaa he
 This effort has been made on those patients who have no hope of survival
 atah unako chah maah kii avadhi tak bhi jivit rakh paanaa ek uplabdhi he
 Robert Tool, an eight-year-old telecom employee who had a heart attack twice and who was also suffering from diabetes, could survive a record 151 days with the help of "abicor" heart
 boyonic netra or kaan hamaare netra lakhon chhadon or konon se bane hue hai jisase hame drushti praapt hoti he
 They have the ability to convert light into electrical impulses and transport it from the optic nerve to the brain where the image of that object is made
 parantu retinis pigmentosa or zyada umr main hone vaali e
em
di, aadi bimariyon se swasth koshikaon kaa apakarsh ho saktaa he or ek samay ke uparaant insaan netraheen bhi ho saktaa he
 But as long as the optic nerve is healthy, then there is no need to be discouraged as researchers around the world are trying to bring back the vision of victims suffering from eye diseases
 neparville ke opatobionix ne kritrim silicon retina kaa vikaas kiya he
 This artificial retina contains 2 mm
 Microchips of k diameter and thickness of 25 microns have been used
 illinois naamak yah microchip aankh ke andar feet ho jaataa he or 5000 aise sookshmdarshi upkarnon se nirmit he jo saurya vidyut paidaa kar sakate hai
 These devices convert the light entering the eyes into electrical senses
 yah vidyut abhas retina kii baaki koshikaon ko uttejit karte hai jisase ki insaan ko simit drushti praapt ho sakati he
 Another person striving towards this is Dr
 William Dobell, who, with the help of his dedicated team, provided vision to many blind people
 unki team ne safaltaapurvak ek aisa mastishk-camera gathjod banaaya he jisase ki aankhon ke saamne kii tastavir ek computer par daal di jaati he
 These pictures are sent to the electrode implanted in the blind man's brain by operation
 isso jo drushti praapt hoti he usase saamne prastut vyakti yaa vastu kaa dot matrix chitra hi dikhaai detaa he
 But with the continuous use of this tool, the person starts seeing more detailed images
 shravan ke kshetra main bionix kii bhoomika maanav kaan main asankhya rome koshikaaye hoti hai jo shravan karne main arthath anekanek awaajon ko sunne main sahaayak hoti hai
 But if it is damaged, the sound will not reach the brain from the auditory nerves, and this deficiency can only be overcome by cocohaler planting
 is ropan main asankhya electrode hote hai jo rome koshikaon ke kaary ko doharaate hai jisase shravan ke liye jaruri jaankaree mastishk tak pahunch jaati he or sunne main sahaayak hoti he
 a bionic ear has been made under research conducted by a Melbourne institution which is wrapped in an element called smart plastic
 yah tatv bhitari kaan main tantrikaon or koshikaon ke vikaas ko badhaava detaa he
 Bionics supporting humans is easy for most humans to move
 parantu quadirapalegia naamak bimaari se peedit insaan ko ek inch bhi hilne-dulne ke liye bahut praytn karne padate hai
 So far we have seen artificial arms and legs that can be applied on human body from above, but they are also possible to use only that means even these hands and feet can be moved only if the nerves can do to the damaged muscles
 Inspire for japan kii sukuba vishvavidhyalay ke yoshiyuki sankai ke prayatnon kii vajah sa aise shodh hue hai jo marurajju arthath spinal card or anya durghatnaon se peedit vyaktiyon ke liye vardaan sabit ho sakati hai

 Dr
 Gerald Leeab, a professor at a University of Southern California, is working with his team on a technique called Bayonne that aims to revive paralyzed muscles
 yah bion aise vidyut upkaran hai jo ki maanav sharir main usee jagah ek sui kii madad se antahkshep kare ja sakate hai jahaan par isaki jarurat ho
 Its power source is the radio wave that can be supported by an external controller worn by the patient

 Braingate is a technique by which a small chip is placed in the brain that sends human thoughts to a computer and the same conceptual signals can send e-mails to the computer, games can be played on the computer, Just by thinking
 bionix ke saakaratmak pahaluon ko agar ham bhavishya main aage badaye to maanav samaaj ko aage badhaane main or maanav jindagi ko behatar banane ke liye ise prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Industrial relations is a multi-disciplinary field of work that studies employment relations
 audyogic sambandhon ko teji se rojgaar sambandh kaha jane laga he, aisa gaiyr-audyogic rojgaar sambandhon ke mahatv ke kaaran hua he
 Many outsiders also consider industrial relations as equal to labor relations and understand that industrial relations only study organized employment conditions, but this is an over simplification
 swami or shramik ke nijee uddeshyon kii bhinnata ne audyogic sambandhon kii samasya ko janm diya
 The social objectives of industries have now been well accepted as a toilet for human welfare
 iskaa arth he, kaam karne ke liye adhik anukool aisi avasthaaon kaa srijan jinke antargat utpaadan ko suvyavasthit kiya ja sake or utpaadan ke do mukhya prasadhano, poonji or shram, ke bich honevaali kriya pratikriya ko suvibhajit karne ke liye ek upyukt siddhant ban sake
 Under the old system of factories, the capitalists treated workers as a marketable commodity and were disciplined according to the law of demand and supply for wages, working hours and job restrictions
 aarambh main to shramikon ne ise tal janevaali vipatti samajha, kintu baad main unhen yah bhaan hua ki unke ye du:kha praaia: sthaayee se ho chale hai
 In the jurisdiction of the Swami, their social and physical deprivation became quadruple by the day and thus the relationship of the two did not remain in such a manner which can be called goodwill in any way
 samasya dinon-din ugr rup dhaaran karti gai
 Now industrial relations means not only the relation of the owner labor, but also the personal relationship, co-consultation, joint transaction of committees and the role of government in the subsistence work of these relations
 madhyayug main vyapaaron kaa kshetra chota tha tathaa swami evam shramik adhik nikat sampark main the
 Workers considered themselves a different caste from the owners 
 dhire-dhire unhen bodh hua ki unki vyaktigat shakti kitni alp thi
 Then his situation deteriorated further, causing him to become like Krittadas and finally the relation of Swami Shramik was stabilized on this basis
 utpaadan kaary main kaarkaanon kii paddati prarambh hone par shramik varg ne apana sangh sthapit karnaa aarambh kiya
 In this direction, the workers of Britain first proved to be pioneers in the 19th century, although their union remained illegal until 1824 AD
 phir bhi, audyogic sanghatanon ke andolan ke vikaas ke saath-saath sanyukt mol bhav kii pranali shaktishaalee banati gai, or aaj yah pranali na keval britain main, varan vishwa bhar ke deshon main, audyogic sambandhon ko sunishchit karne kii mukhya pranali ke rup main vyavahrut ho rahi he
 The importance of these organizations can only be understood that from 1900 AD, they started influencing the politics of some countries and started to influence their present and future more and more
 audyogic-shram-sanghatanon kaa antarrashtriya sangh 1919 i
 main sthapit hua jisamen 60 deshon ke maalikon, shramikon evam sarkaron ke pratinidhi sammilit hue
 In some European countries, the union of owners and workers was taken under government control
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan or uske baad bhi adhikansh deshon kii sarkaron ne apane maamalon main maalikon evam shramikon ke pratinidhiyon se paraamarsh grahan kiya
 Now, in general, all the workers are beginning to understand their importance to the country and have also come to know that their happiness is ultimately dependent on developing production
 audyogic sambandhon ke teen pahalu hai: vigyaan nirmaan, samasya hal karnaa or aachaar sambandhi
vigyaan nirmaan pahalu main audyogic sambandh saamaajik vigyaan kaa bhaag hai or vah ucch-gunvattta, kathor anusandhan ke madhyam se rojgaar sambandhon or unke sansthaanon ko samajhane kii koshish karata he
 In this nature, industrial relations is intersected by scholarship in labor, labor economics, industrial sociology, labor and social history, human resource management, political science, law and other fields
 samasya hal karne ke pahalu main, audyogic sambandh nitiyaan or sansthaaen dizin karne kii koshish karte hai taaki rojgaar sambandh ko behatar tareeke se kaam karne main madad kar paaen
 aachaar sambandhi pahalu main audyogic sambandh, kaaryakartaaon or rojgaar sambandh ke bare main majboot maanak siddhant samavisht karte hai, vishesh rup se shramjivi varg ke saath ek upyogi vastu ke rup main vyavhaar karne kaa asveekaran karke kaaryakartaaon ko manushyon ke rup main dekhne ko protsaahan dete hai, jise loktantric samudaayon main maanav adhikaron kaa naam diya gaya he
 Industrial relations scholarship believes that labor markets are not fully competitive and therefore contrary to mainstream economic theory, employers typically have more bargaining power than employees
 audyogic sambandh vidvatta kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki niyoktaaon or karmchaariyon ke bich kam se kam kuch swaabhaavik abhiruchiyaan mail nahin khaati or isliye maanav sansaadhan prabandhan or sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar main vidvatta ke vipareet sangharsh, rojgaar sambandh ke ek prakritik bhaag ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Industrial relations scholars therefore often study the characterization of various institutional arrangements that characterize and shape the employment relationship - from standard and power structures on the business surface to employee voice mechanisms in the workplace, from a company, regional or From bargaining the system collectively at the national level, to different levels of public policy and labor law, " "varieties of pragmatism", social democracy and neo-liberalism)
 jab shram bazaar apurna rup main dekha jaataa he or jab rojgaar sambandh main abhiruchiyaan mail nahin khaati, tab ek insaan bazaar yaa prabandhakon se hameshaa mazdooron ke hiton kii seva karne kii or charam maamalon main majdoor shoshan ko rokane kii ummid nahin kar saktaa
 isliye audyogic sambandh vidwaan or vyavsaayee, rojgaar sabandh ke kaamkaaj main sudhaar laane or mazdooron ke adhikaron kii raksha karne ke liye sansthagat hastkshepon kaa samarthan karte hai
 The nature of these institutional interventions, however, differs within the two camps of industrial relations
 bahulwaadi shivi rojgaar sambandh ko sahbhaaji hiton or hiton ke takaraav ke ek mishran ke rup main dekhtaa he jo vyapak rup se rojgaar sambandh tak simit hai
 In the workplace, pluralists therefore support grievance procedures, employee voice mechanisms such as the Construction Work Council and labor unions, collective bargaining and labor-management partnerships
 In the policy sphere, pluralists advocate minimum wage laws, occupational health and safety standards, international labor standards, and other employment and labor laws and public policies
 in sabhi sansthagat hastkshepon ko rojgaar sambandh kaa santulan saadhane ke tareekon ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jinase na keval aarthik kshamta utpann kii jaati he, balki karmchaaree equity or awaz bhi
 iske vipareet, marxvaadi-prerit samikshatmak shivi niyokta-karmchaaree hiton ke takaraav ko saamaajik-raajnneetik-aarthik pranali main dur tak sannihit tathaa teevr pratirodhi ke rup main dekhtaa he
 From this point of view, the search for a balanced employment relationship places too much weight on the interests of employers and instead needs permanent structural reforms to permanently replace the intensely resistant employment relationship inherent within capitalism
 is prakaar aatankwaadi trade unionon kaa aksar samarthan kiya jaataa he
 Industrial relations have their roots in the Industrial Revolution which has created a modern employment relationship with thousands of paid workers giving rise to free labor market and wide industrial organizations
 jab samaaj in baari aarthik or saamaajik parivartanon ke saath ladaa tab shram samasyaayein paidaa hui
 Low salaries, long working hours, sound and dangerous work and abusive supervisory behavior led to high employee sales amounts, violent beatings and the threat of social instability

 Industrial relations was formed with a strong problem-solving orientation, which rejected both classical economists' Lasse Fair solutions to labor problems and the Marxist solutions of the class revolution
 yah vahi drushtikon he jo sanyukt rajya america main nae samjhauta kanoon kaa aadhaar he jaise ki naishanal lebar releshanz act or fere lebar standardaz act
 Industrial relations scholars have described three major theoretical approaches or structures, which contrast in their understanding and analysis of workplace relationships
 teen vichaar aam taur par akeshwarwadi, bahulwaadi or prajatantravaadi ke rup main jane jate hai
 Each provides a particular perception of workplace relationships and will therefore interpret events such as workplace conflicts, unions' roles, and job regulation differently
 prajatantravaadi drushtikon kabhi-kabhi "takaraav model" ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he, haalanki yah kuch had tak aspasht he, kyonki bahulwaad ko bhi aisa lagata he ki takaraav kaarysthalon main swaabhaavik rup se hota he
 Democratic theories have been effectively identified with Marxist theories, although they are not limited to these
 akeshwarwad main, sanghathan ko "ek khush parivaar" ke adarsh ke saath ek sankalit or anuroop purna ikai ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jahaan prabandhan or staff ke anya sadsy sabhi aapasi sahyog par jor dete hue, ek samaan uddeshy ke sahabhaagi hote hai
 Furthermore, monotheism has a paternalistic view, where it demands the loyalty of all employees, is predominantly managerial in asserting and applying
 natijatan, trade unionon ko anaavashyak samajha jaataa he kyonki karmchaariyon or sanghathanon ke bich kii vafadari ko paraspar akhandit mana jaataa he, jaha udyog ke do pahalu nahin ho sakate
 takaraav ko badhakaari samajha jaataa he or sanchaar vishleshan, antarvaiyaktik gharshan or andolankariyon kaa tarkahin nateeja mana jaataa he
 In pluralism, it is understood that the organization is made up of powerful and different sub-groups, each with its own legitimate allegiance and its own set of objectives and leaders
 vishesh rup se, bahulwaad drushtikon main do pramukh up-samooh hai: prabandhan or trade union
 As a result, the management role will be less inclined towards controlling and implementing and more towards persuasion and coordination
 Trade unions are perceived as legitimate representatives of employees, confrontation is dealt with by collective bargaining and not necessarily seen as a bad thing, if managed it will actually lead to development and positive change Can take in audyogic sambandhon kaa yah drushtikon poonjivadi samaaj ke swabhaav ko dekhtaa he, jahaan puunji or shram ke bich abhiruchi kaa ek moulik vibhaajan he or kaarysthal sambandhon ko is itihaas ke viruddh dekhtaa he
 This view understands that inequalities of power and economic wealth have their roots in the nature of the capitalist economic system
 isliye takaraav ko anivaary samajha jaataa he or trade union puunji dwaara ho rahe karmchaariyon ke shoshan ke khilaaf unka ek prakritik jawaab he
 While there may be several rounds of consensus, the Marxist view would be that institutions of joint regulation would increase the status quo of management rather than demarcate it as they presume its continuity rather than challenge capitalism
 kai khaaton dwaara, audyogic sambandh aajkal sankat main hai
 In the academic world, its traditional place is threatened by the prominence of mainstream economics and organizational behavior on the one hand and modernity on the other
 niti banane vaale samudaayon main, audyogic sambandhon ke sansthagat hastkshep par jor se bad kar he, muft bazaaron ke leses fere prachaar par niolibral jor
 abhyaas main, shram unionon main giravat aa rahi he or kam companiyon main audyogic sambandh kaary hai
 The number of academic programs in industrial relations is therefore shrinking and scholars are leaving this field for other fields, particularly human resource management and organizational behavior
 The importance of work, however, is stronger than ever and the lessons of industrial relations are important
