 That is why King Janmejaya got very upset with this and he started snake warrior to destroy snakes all over the world

 The Garud Purana gives a beautiful anecdote about Maharishi Kashyap and Takshak Nag
 rishi shaap se jab raja parakshit ko takshak naag dasane ja rahaa tha, tab maarg main uski bhent kashyap rishi se hui
 Takshak disguised as a Brahmin and asked him where he was going in such a hurry
 On this, Kashyap said that Takshak Nag Maharaj is going to bash Parikshit
 main unka vish prabhaav dur karke unhen pun: jivan de duungaa
 Hearing this, Takshak introduced himself and asked him to return
 kyonki uske vish-prabhaav se aaj tak koi bhi vyakti jivit nahin bachaa tha
 Then sage Kashyapa said that with his mantra power, he will remove the poison-effect of Raj Parikshit
 is par takshak ne kaha ki yadi aisi baat he to aap is vriksh ko phir se haraa-bharaa karke dikhaaiye
 i still consume it by stalking
 takshak ne vriksh ko apane vish prabhaav se tatkaal bhasma kar diya
 On this, the sage Kashyap collected the ash of that tree and blew his mantra
 tabhi takshak ne aashcharya se dekha ki us bhasma main se konpal foot ai or dekhte hi dekhte vah haraa-bharaa vriksh ho gaya
 Surprised Takshak asked the sage why he was going to do good to the king
 The sage replied that he would get abundant wealth from there
 is par takshak ne unhen unki sambhaavna se bhi adhik dhan dekar waapas bhej diya
 In this Purana it is said that Kashyapa Rishi had this effect by listening to 'garuda Purana'

 lekin ab unka maananaa he ki kam se kam bharat main ahimsak virodh pradarshnon or naagarik avagya andolanon se baat nahin ban rahi he
 Arundhati, trapped in the ideologies of the Communists who became part of the parliamentary system and the Maoists who believe in violent resistance, accepts that she is not a blind devotee of Gandhi

 When he went on hunger-strike, he was a superstar sitting on a hunger-strike
 lekin main superstar raajnneeti main yaqiin nahin karti
 yadi kisi jhuggi kii janata bhukh-hadtaal karti he to koi isaki parvaah nahin karata
" Arundhati believes that the voices of protest are being unheard of in India, which is drifting under the flow of marketism
 janvirohi vyavastha ke kilaaf nyaaypalika or media ko prabhavit karne ke prayaas naakaam sabit hue hai
 He said, "I think it is very important for us to consider where we have been right and where wrong
 The arguments we have given are correct

 " nyaaypalika kii avmaananaa ke aarope main sankshipt qaid kaat chuki arundhati kaa spasht kahana he ki vah hathiyaar uthaane vaale logon kii ninda nahin karatin
 He told Reuters in an interview, "I am not in a position to say that everyone should take up arms, because i am not ready to take up arms myself 


 but at the same time i don't want to condemn those who are effective
 There are other ways of being
 " He clarified his view in an interview to the Guardian - "it would be unethical for me to preach violence to anyone, until i get down to violence myself
" lekin isi tarah, mere liye virodh pradarshnon or bhukh-hadataalon kii baat karnaa bhi aniatik hoga, jab main ghinauni hinsa se surakshit hoon
 i certainly cannot tell Iraqis, Kashmiris or Palestinians that if they go on a mass hunger strike they will get freedom from military occupation
 Civil disobedience movements do not appear to be successful

 swami dayanand saraswati Arya Samaj is a Hindu reform movement founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati in 1875 in Bombay with the inspiration of Swami Virjanand of Mathura
 yah andolan paashchaatya prabhaavon kii pratikriya swaroop hindu dharm main sudhaar ke liye prarambh hua tha
 The Aryans believed in pure Vedic tradition in society and rejected idol worship, avatarism, sacrifice, false rituals and superstitions
 isamen chuaachhut va jatigat bhedbhaav kaa virodh kiya tathaa striyon va shudron ko bhi yagyopavit dhaaran karne va veda padhane kaa adhikaar diya tha
 The book titled Satyarth Prakash composed by Swami Dayanand Saraswati is the original book of Arya Samaj
 arya samaaj kaa adarsh vaakya he: krinvanto vishwamaryam, jiskaa arth he - vishwa ko arya banaate chalo
 Famous Arya Samaj people include Swami Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Shraddhanand, Mahatma Hansraj, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bhai Parmanand, Pandit Gurudutt, Swami Anandbodh Saraswati, Swami Achhutanand, Chaudhary Charan Singh, Pandit Vandemataram Ramchandra Rao, Baba Ramdev etc
 arya shabd kaa arth he shreshth or pragatisheel
 Hence Arya Samaj means a society of superior and progressive people, who try to follow the Vedas
 dusron ko us par chalane ko prerit karte hai
 The ideals of Aryasamajis are Maryada Purushottam Rama and Yogiraj Krishna
 maharishi dayanand ne usee veda mat ko phir se sthapit karne ke liye arya samaaj kii neenv rakhi
 All the principles and rules of Arya Samaj are based on the Vedas
 arya samaaj kii manyataon ke anusaar falit jyotish, jaadu-tona, janmapatri, shraadh, tarpan, vrath, bhoot-pret, devi jaagran, murti puja or tirth yatra managasaint hai, veda viruddh hai
 The Arya Samaj asks to worship the true God, this God is omnipresent like air and sky, he does not incarnate, he gives fruits to all human beings according to their order, gives birth next, be focused in any solitude at home
 Can
 iske anusaar dainik yajna karnaa har arya kaa karttavya he
 No one can make atoms, nor can they be fragments
 yani vah anadi kaal se hai
 In the same way, one divine and we are living beings from time immemorial

 Motivates souls to do deeds
 phir chaar rishiyon ke man main 20,378 vedamantron kaa arth sahit gyaan or apana parichay detaa he
 Satyarth Prakash is the original text of Arya Samaj
 anya mananeey granth hai - veda, upanishad, shad darshan, gita va valmiki ramayana ityadi
 Maharishi Dayanand has given the essence of all this in Satyarth Prakash
 18 ghante samadhi main rahane vaale yogiraj dayanand ne lagbhag aath hajaar kitabon kaa manthan kar adbhut or krantikari satyarth prakaash kii rachana kii
 The best and personal name of God is Om
 usamen anant gun hone ke kaaran uske brahma, mahesh, vishnu, ganesh, devi, agni, shani vagairah anant naam hai
 Idol worship with their different names is not good
 arya samaaj varnavyavastha yani brahman, kshatriya, vaisya va shudra ko karm se maanata he, janm se nahin
 The Arya Samaj is indigenous, self-language, self-culturing and self-righteous
 arya samaaj sristi kii utpatti kaa samay chaar arab 32 karod varsh or itnaa hi samay pralay kaal kaa maanata he
 According to the Vedas, the time of liberation obtained from yoga is considered 31 nil 10 trillion 40 billion i
e
 a transcendental period
 arya samaaj vasudaiv kutunbakam ko maanata he
 But globalization is considered fatal for the country, society and culture
 arya samaaj vaidic samaaj rachana ke nirmaan va arya chakravarti rajya sthapit karne ke liye prayasarat he
 In this society, meat, eggs, bidis, cigarettes, alcohol, tea, chilli-spices etc
 are against the Vedas
 arya samaaj ne bharat main rashtravaadi vichaardhaara ko aage badhaane main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 Its followers participated vigorously in the Indian independence movement
 arya samaaj ke prabhaav se hi bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bheetar swadeshi aandolan armbh hua tha
 Swamiji was the first great man among the religious leaders of modern India who used the word 'swarajya'
 arya samaaj ne hindu dharm main ek nayi chetana kaa aarambh kiya tha
 Arya Samaj was the most powerful movement in the pre-independence era as a renaissance and revival movement of Hindu society
 yah puure pashchim or uttar bharat main sakriy tha tathaa supt hindu jati ko jaagrit karne main sanlagn tha
 Even Arya Samaj preachers were reaching Fiji, Mauritius, Guyana, Trinidad, South Africa with the aim of organizing Hindus
 arya samaajiyon ne sabase bada kaary jati vyavastha ko todane or sabhi hinduon main samanta kaa bhav jaagrit karne kaa kiya
 The way India was made an economic colony of the British government and later a political colony, it was natural for Indians to react sharply against it
 chunki bharat dhire-dhire pashchimi vichaaron kii ore badhane laga tha, atah pratikriya saamaajik kshetra se aana swaabhaavik kaary thi
 This reaction came in the form of social reform movements that arose in the 19th century
 aise hi samaaj sudhaar andolanon main aryasamaj kaa naam aata he
 The Arya Samaj did its work by internal reforms in the society itself, to throw off foreign gambling
 isane aadhunik bharat main prarambh hue purnajagaran ko nai disha di
 At the same time, it inspired Indians to adopt Indianism, to accept ancient culture as fundamental, to end Western influence with the slogan of Pure Indianism i
e
 'return to the Vedas' and unite all Indians
 19veen shatabdi main bharat main samaaj sudhaar ke andolanon main aryasamaj agrani tha
 Aryasamaj took the first step in the salvation of Harijans, he first understood the need for education of girls
 varna vyavastha ko janmagat na maanakar karmgat siddh karne kaa sehara uske sir he | jatibhed bhav or khanpan ke chhotchhaat or chauke-chuulhe kii baadhaon ko mitaane kaa gaurav usee ko praapt he
 He dug up thousands of incest graves in the name of superstition and religion
 1875 main sthapana ke sheeghra baad hi isaki prasiddhi tatkaaleen samaaj vichaarkon, aacharyon, samaaj sudhaarkon aadi ko prabhavit karne main safal hui, or kuch varshon baad hi aryasamaj kii sampurna bharat ke pramukh shaharon main shakhayein sthapit ho gayi
 Swamiji's scholarly lectures and miraculous personality turned the youth towards Aryasamaj
 anya samakaleen saamaajik dharmik andolanon kii apeksha aryasamaj sahi artha main adhik rashtravaadi tha
 It was a movement with a more aggressive nature against westernization flourishing in India
 arya samaaj ne apni sthapana se hi saamaajik kuritiyon ke viruddh aandolan kaa shankhanaad kiya, jaise- jativaadee jadmulak samaaj ko todna, mahilaon ke liye samaanadhikaar, balvivaah kaa unmoolan, vidhwaa vivaah kaa samarthan, nimna jatiyon ko saamaajik adhikaar praapt hona aadi
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati made the above social renaissance the main foundation behind the establishment of Arya Samaj
 unka vishwaas tha ki naveen prabud bharat main, navjagrit hote samaaj main, naye bharat kaa nirmaan karnaa he to samaaj ko bandhanmukt karnaa pratham kaary hona chahie
 Despite being a Brahmin himself, Swamiji represented the rebellion of the authority of Brahmins and sharply condemned religious superstitions and rituals
 alpakaal main hi ve bharat ke samaaj sudhaar ke kshetra main naveen gyaan-jyoti ke rup main udayiman hue
 In this he found that the Indian youth is insisting on western imitation
 atah unhonen paashchaatya samskruti par shaktishaalee prahaar kiya or bhartiya gaurav ko sadaiv ooncha kiya
 In general, Swamiji criticized regional sects and other religions as well as highlighting the faults operating in Indian society and Hinduism
 purohitwaad par karaara prahaar karte hue swamiji ne mana tha ki swaarthon or agyani purohiton ne puraanon jaise grantho kaa sahaara lekar hindu dharm kaa bhrasht kiya he
 Swami ji was strongly opposed to idolatry, ritualism, mythology, systemicism as a reformer
 iske liye unhone vedon kaa sahaara lekar vibhinn drushtaant kiye
 With this, he made a wonderful attempt to animate the dormant Indian public
 swami ji ne hinduon ko hin, patit or kaayar hone ke bhav se mukt kiya or unamem utkar aatmavishvaas jaagrit kiya
 Consequently, the society could revolt against the mental slavery of the West with strong confidence and determination
 inhi krantikari vichaaron ke kaaran velentine shirol ne swamiji ko 'indian arnest' kaha
 See, Dayanand Anglo Vedic School, Gurukul Kangri University swami dayanand ke mulmantra tha ki janata kaa vikaas or pragati sunishchit karne or unke astitv kii raksha karne kaa sarvottam saadhan shiksha he
 Aryasamaj worked by tying this mantra in a knot
 aryasamaj ne is tathy ko aatmsaat kar liya tha ki shiksha kii jaden rashtriya bhaavana or parampara main gahari jami honi chaiye
 We inherit an ancient and noble tradition
 hamaari shiksha main bhartiya nitishastra or darshan ko sarvopari sthaan praapt hoga
 Aryasamaj played a leading role in the field of education by establishing Gurukul and DAV colleges in the field of education
 strishiksha main aryasamaj kaa ullekhneey yogadan rahaa
 By the beginning of 1885, the Amritsar branch of Aryasamaj had announced the establishment of two women's schools and a third was proposed at Katra Dula
 1880 ke dauraan lahore aryasamaj mahila shiksha ke kshetra main agrani bana hua tha
 In 1889, Ferozepur Arya Samaj established a girls' school
 arya samaaj se jude log bharat kii swatantrata ke saath-saath bharat kii samskruti, bhashaa, dharm, shiksha aadi ke kshetra main sakriy rup se jude rahe
 Swami Dayanand's mother tongue was Gujarati and he had a good knowledge of Sanskrit, but on the advice of Keshav Chandra Sen, he composed Satyarth Prakash in Hindi
 dayanand ne satyarth prakaash jaisaa krantikari granth hindi main rachakar hindi ko ek pratishtha di
 Aryasamaj called Hindi as 'aryabhasha' and said that knowledge of it is necessary for all Aryasamajis
 dayanand ji vedon kaa kii vyakhya sanskrit ke saath-saath hindi main bhi kii
 Swami Shraddhanand also took the loss and published many letters and magazines in Hindi written in Devanagari script whereas his publication was earlier in Urdu
 aryasamaj hindi ke samvardhan ke maidan main agragami bana
 Hindi language was preferred in hundreds of gurukuls, DAV schools and colleges and for this work, new syllabus books were created through Hindi language at places like Gurukul Kangri and Lahore, whose subjects were science, mathematics, sociology, history etc
 
 yah ek alag hi kism kaa hindi bhashaa main pareekshan tha jiske vaanchhneeya parinaam nikle
 In abroad, Bhavani Dayal Sanyasi, Bhai Parmanand, Ganga Prasad Upadhyay, Dr
 Chiranjeev Bhardwaj, Mehta Jaimini, Acharya Ramdev, Pandit Chamupati etc
 propagated the Hindi language among the diaspora so that they could stay away from their homeland, its culture, its ideology He was not only connected but also made known to his foreign-born descendants
 aryasamaj dwaara na keval punjab main hindi bhashaa kaa prachaar kiya gaya apitu sudur dakshin bharat main, assam, burma aadi tak hindi ko pahunchaaya gaya
 Efforts were also made by Swami Shraddhanand to use simple Hindi language in place of difficult language in the court
 arya samaaj kii hindi patrakarita ne desh ko rashtriya samskruti, dharmachintan, swadeshi kaa paath padhaayaa
 Through the Aryasamaj, there was an unprecedented growth of literature, both enlightening and romantic
 swami dayanand patrakarita dwaara dharm prachaar vyapak rup se karnaa chaahate the
 He himself could not get out any letter, but encouraged the Arya Samajis to take out magazines and magazines
 arya samaaj kii vibhinn sansthaaon dwaara prasaarit hone vaali patr-patrikaon main ‘pavamaan’, ‘aatm shuddhi path’, ‘vaidic garjana’, ‘arya sankalp’, ‘vaidic ravi’, ‘vishvajyoti’, ‘satyarth saurabh’, ‘dayanand sandesh’, ‘maharishi dayanand smriti prakaash’, ‘tapobhumi’, ‘nutan nishkaam patrika’, ‘arya prerana’, ‘arya sansar’, ‘sudhaarak’, ‘tankaara samachar’, ‘agnidoot’, ‘arya sevak’, ‘bharatoday’, ‘arya musafir’, ‘arya sandesh’, ‘arya maryaada’, ‘arya jagat’, ‘arya mitra’, ‘arya pratinidhi’, ‘arya maartand’, ‘arya jivan’, ‘paropkaaree’, ‘samvarddhini’ aadi masik, pakshik va vaarshik patrikaayen prakashit ho rahi hai jisase hindi patrakarita ko navy alok mil rahaa he

 If instead, we take the opposite extreme position and assume that all consumers belong to the producer group and also assume that their only purchasing power is related to the salary that is received as production and the cost of the product His salary is full, so the graph looks completely different

 With which the people of Lilliput occupy the people of Blefuscu

 He returns to his home in England, but finds himself unable to live in the midst of the yahoo and becomes a recluse, escaping from his family and his wife even while staying at her house and spending several hours a day Spends talking to horses in his stables
 yah anishchit he ki swift ne kab gulivers travels ko likhnaa shuru kiya, lekin kuch sutron ke anusaar isaki shuruyaat 1713 main hui jab swift, ge, pope, arbuthnot or kuch anya logon ne, tatkaaleen lokapriy saahitiyik gathnon par vyangy karne ke liye scribleras club banaaya
 Swift's theory is inspired by the writing of memories of the club's fictional writer, Martinus Scribeleras
 swift ke patrachaar se yah pataa chalata he ki isaki rachana thik tarah se 1720 main shuru hui, jiske darpan-vishyak bhaag i or II ko sabase pehle likhaa gaya, iske baad 1723 main bhaag IV or 1724 main bhaag III likhaa gaya, parantu isamen us samay bhi sanshodhan kiye gayi jab swift dreprs letters likh rahe the
 By August 1725 the book was complete, and since Gulliver's Travels was transparently a satire against Whig, it is likely that Swift used the manuscript, so that his authorship could not be used as a proof If someone takes legal action against them
 
 march 1726 main swift apane kaam ke prakaashan ke liye landan gaye; unki pandulipi ko gupt rup se prakaashak benjamin motta ko diya gaya, jinhone teji se utpaadan karne ke liye or piresi ko rokane ke liye paanch printing house kaam main liye
 Mottay felt that it would be the biggest selling point, but he feared that legal action could be taken against it, so he cut the worst offending facts and added some material in favor of Queen Anne in Book II and somehow Published on this
 pehle sanskaran ko do khandon main 26 oktober 1726 ko release kiya gaya, jisaki keemat 8s
 6d
 thi
 The book created a sensation and the first part was sold out in less than a week
 motta ne gumnaam rahete hue gulivers travels kaa prakaashan kiya, iske baad agle kuch saalon main kai anuvartiyon, perodiyon, or "kees" kaa utpaadan kiya gaya
 Most of these were published anonymously and quickly forgotten
 swift ne inamen se kisi ko bhi apni pustak main shaamil nahin kiya or unhone vishesh rup se 1735 ke falconar ke sanskaran main inhen shaamil karne se inkaar kar diya
 However, Swift's friend Alexander Pope wrote a set of five editions on Gulliver's Travels, which Swift liked so much that he included them in the second edition of the book, though they are not usually included at present
 1735 main ek irish prakaashak jorge falconar ne, ab tak kiye gaye swift ke kaam ke puure set kaa mudran kiya, jiskaa khand III gulivers travels tha
 As appears in Faulkner's "advertisement to the Reader", Faulkner had an explanatory copy of Mottte's work available through "a friend of the author" who kept much of the handwriting free from Motté's modifications, The original manuscript was destroyed
 aisa bhi mana jaataa he ki swift ne mudran se pehle kam se kam falconar ke sanskaran ke pramaan kii samiksha to kii hi thi, lekin yah pramanit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 saamanyatya, ise gulivers travels ke editiyo princepse ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jisamen ek apwaad he, jiskaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 This edition included a portion by Swift, a Letter from Captain Gulliver to His Cousin Simpson
 It complained about Motta making changes to the original text, stating that they had changed it so much that "I just can't seem to find it my job" and all the changes Mottay presented in the intervening years Keys, misrepresentation, parody, the second part and the work done beyond it were rejected
 yah patr ab kai maanak paathyon kaa hissaa he
 The short episode of Part III, recounting the rebellion of the surface city of Lindalino against the flying island of Laputa, was clearly allegorical to the Drapier's Letters, which Swift was proud of
 lindalino ne dublin kaa pratinidhitiv kiya or laputa ke adhyaropan ne wiliam wood kii buree gunvattta kii tambe kii mudra ke british adhyaropan kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 Faulkner removed the verse, either because a position of political sensitivity arose because of an anti-british satire being printed by an Irish publisher
 yaa sambhavatya iskaa kaaran yah tha ki jis paathya se unhone kaam kiya tha, usamen is padya ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya tha
 In 1899, this verse was included in a new edition of the archived works
 aadhunik sanskaran falconar ke sanskaran ke vyutpann hai, jinamein 1899 ke sanshodhano ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Isaac Asimov in The Annotated Gulliver writes that Lindalino is composed of double lines; Hence it is called Dublin

 Published seven years after Daniel Defoe's highly successful Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels can be read as a systematic refutation of Defoe's optimistic potential of humans
 anthincable swift: da spontanias philosophy of a carch of england main main warren montag tark dete hai ki swift ne is baat ko bataaya ki vyakti hi samaaj kaa chithran karata he
 As indicated in Defoe's novel
 swift is soch ko thomas hobs ke rajnatik darshan ke khatarnaak kattarpanth ke rup main dekhte hai or isiilie guliver baar baar alag dwipon ke bajaay sthapit samudaayon ko chitrit karte hai
 The captain who invites Gulliver in his third disastrous voyage to work as a surgeon on his ship is named Robinson
 sambhawatah is pustak kii clasik sthiti kaa ek kaaran yah he ki ise kai alag alag logon ke liye kai chizon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Broadly speaking, this book has three themes: kahani katha or rachana ke shabdon main iske bhaag ek praturup kaa anusaran karte hai: Gulliver's character himself is equally interesting — he is a happy optimist in the first part and becomes a bonafide psycho by the end of the book
 hamen is kaam ke saar ko samajhnaa hoga agar ham aisa maanate hai ki antim manushyadrohi ne hi puri kitaab ko likhaa he
 In this sense Gulliver Travels is a very complex and modern novel
 puri kitaab main sookshm parivartan hote rahete hai, jaise jab guliver naa keval yahuu ke rup main houihanm ko, balki sabhi manushyon ko samajhnaa shuru karata he, Despite the book's subtlety and depth, it is often classified as children's stories
 kyonki kitaab kaa lilliput vaala khand ise bacchon ke lokapriy banataa he
 Only the portion of the book with the title Gulliver Travels can be purchased, describing only Lilliput's journey

 In this debate the names of the speakers, other mentioned persons, politicians and emperors of the then and past, most of the other countries and cities of Europe and America are presented in different forms with many types of pseudonym of Swift

 In the field of computer architecture, the terms big-endian and little-endian are used to describe two possible ways of inserting bytes into memory; See ndas
 These words are derived from a satirical conflict in the book, in which the two religious sects of Lilliput are divided into two types, one who likes to break the boiled egg in a small way and the other who likes it in a big way Likes to break
 inamen se sabase pehla tha, 1727 main prakashit memoirs of da court of lilliput, jo guliver ke lilliput or blefusku main rahane vaale prakaran kaa hi vistaar he

 One, Pichazas Faremidoba, describes a journey to a land where almost robot-like, metal creatures that have control of science rather than emotions interact through a language based on musical notes
 doosraa, kepileria, purush mahila sambandh par ek vyangyatmak tippanee he
 It details Gulliver's world journey in which all intelligent beings are women, the importance of men has been reduced to the work of reproduction

 Alison Fell's novel "the Mistress of Lilliput" is similar to this: in which Mary Gulliver herself goes on a journey
 yah vartmaan samaaj kii prathaon, jaise khel, television, raajnneeti aadi par vyangy karata he
 To illustrate the justification for the parody, the story is set just after Swift's final journey and retains the literary style of the original work throughout the story

 He was in the Indian National Congress political party

 On March 18, 1981, Shivshankar as Law Minister addressed a circular to the Governors and Chief Ministers of all the states so that they could receive additional judges 


 their agreement could be transferred to any High Court
 paripatr main ullikhit kaaran yah the ki sthanantaran kii aisi niti rashtriya ekikaran, jati, sambandh, or anya sthaneey vichaaron jaise sankeern or sankeern pravritiyon kaa muqabla karne main madad karegi
 But the circular was seen as an expression of mistrust in the judiciary and a tool to punish inconvenient judges
 granville austin, apane kaaryakari e democratic samvidhan main: da indian experions ne paripatr ke bare main kaha: "isane madhya april main saarvajanik gyaan banane par maujuuda aag par kerosine phenk diya ki paripatr ne praptakartaaon se praapt karne ke liye kaha rajya ke ucch nyaayalay main atirikt nyaayadhishon ko unki sahmati kisi bhi anya ucch nyaayalay main sthaayee nyaayadhishon ke rup main niyukt karne kii sahmati he or kisi bhi anya ucch nyaayalay main niyukt hone ke liye sambhavit nyaayadhishon kii sahmati se praapt karne ke liye desh
 'written consent and preferences were to be sent to Shivshankar within two weeks, in the Lok Sabha, Shivshankar asked if the independence of the judiciary meant "do not touch"
 vah yah pushti karnaa prathit hota tha ki usne bharat ke tatkaaleen mukhya nyaayadhish vaai vaai chandrachud se paraamarsh kiye bina paripatr bheja tha
 What happened after that is history
 30 disambar, 1981 ko supreme court kii saat nyaayadhish bench ne espi gupta banaam bhartiya sangh main apana nirnay diya, jisamen adaalat ne kaha ki shivashankar kaa paripatr asanvaidhanik nahin tha, kyonki isaki pehali jagah koi kanoonee shakti nahin thi
 In his book, Austin refers to various perceptions of Shivshankar during this period
 vichaar ke ek skool kaa maananaa tha ki vah nyaayik aazaadee ko kam karne kaa iraadaa rakhata he, or usne tatkaaleen pradhan mantri shrimati gandhi ke liye apraasangik nyaayadhishon kii niyukti ke liye saavdhaanee se bachaav se parhez kiya
 Another body of opinion, Austin notes, stated that their circular was not intended to threaten judges in favor of the government
 sarkaar ke hit par vichaar karte samay shivashankar nyaayadhishon ko aanshik rup se saavdhaanee baratane ke vipareet nahin the, lekin unki mukhya prerana kaksha or jati chetana main lagi hui prathit hoti he
 As Austin put it: "for him, the judges were intellectuals or Brahmins, or from the newly strengthened economic castes and classes — the upper echelons of other backward classes — whose monopoly had to be broken 'that obcs and lower-ranking members of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes As advocates can 'grow' and find their way to the bench
 austin ne kaha ki shivashankar kaa maananaa tha ki ucch nyaayalayon ke mukhya nyaayadhishon ne sahakarmiyon ko chunane or maamalon kaa nirnay lene main jati kii praathamiktaaon ko dikhaaya he, or sthaanantaran isse behatar ho saktaa he kyonki bahari nyaayadhishon ke paas sthaneey jaden nahin hotin
 Austin also records a personal element that inspired Shivshankar
 "andhra pradesh main kapoo samudaay se ek swayan nirmit vyakti, unhone sochaa ki reddy samudaay vahaan ucch nyaayalay par prabhutv rakhata he, or jab usne sochaa tha to usne ucch nyaayalay se istipha de diya tha reddy nyaayadhish ne unhen mukhya aupchaarikta se inkaar kar diya tha
 "shiv Shankar was a judge in the Andhra Pradesh High Court before venturing into politics between 1974-1975
 1 9 87 main die gaye bhaashan ke dauraan unki gahari tippanee, "sarvocch nyaayalay virdohi saamaajik tatwon, pheraa ulanghan karne waalon, dulhan-burner or pratikriyaakaaron kii puri jhund ke liye ek swarg he", unhen avmaananaa maamle main utraa, varisht vakil, piendiuda dwaara daayar kiya gaya
 But the Supreme Court acquitted him in that case
 shiv shankar kaa nidhan ho rahaa he, ek samay jab ucch nyaayalayon main nyaayadhishon kii niyukti or niyukti, centre or supreme court ke colegium ke bich ek bada mudda jari he, yah ek dukhad anusmarak he ki kaise kaaryakari or ke bich praathamikta ke liye sangharsh nyaaypalika 1 9 80 ke dashak main shuru hui, or aaj bhi jari he
