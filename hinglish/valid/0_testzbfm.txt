 sar izac newton england ke ek vaigyanik the
 Who discovered the law of gravity and the principle of motion
 ve ek mahaan ganitagya, bhautik vaigyanik, jyotish evam darshanik the
 His research form "mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" was published in 1687, in which the laws of universal gravitation and motion were explained and thus laid the foundation of sustainable physics
 unki philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica, 1687 main prakashit hui, yah vigyaan ke itihaas main apane aap main sabase prabhaavshaalee pustak he, jo adhikansh saahitiyik yantriki ke liye aadharbhoot kaary kii bhoomika nibhaati he

 Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643, old style and new style dates | OS]]: 25 December 1642] in Woolsthorpe Manor in woolsthorpe-by-kolsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire
 newton ke janm ke samay, england ne grigorian calendar ko nahin apanaaya tha or isliye unke janm kii tithi ko christmas diwas 25 disambar1642 ke rup main darj kiya gaya
 Newton was born three months after his father's death, he was a prosperous farmer and his name was Isaac Newton
 purv paripakv avasthaa main paidaa hone vaala vah ek chota balak tha; unki mata hanna askf kaa kahana tha ki vah ek chauthai gaylen jaise chote se mag main samaa saktaa tha
 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her
 jaisaa ki 19 varsh tak kii aayu main unke dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon kii suchi main pradarshit hota he: "maine mata or pita smith ke ghar ko jalaane kii dhamkee di
" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers
 vah kheti se nafrat karte the
 Master Henry Stokes of King's School asked his mother to send him back to school so that he could complete his education
 skool ke ek ladke ke khilaaf badla lene kii ichha se prerit hone kii vajah se ve ek sheersh kram ke chaatr ban gaye
 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role
 us samay college kii shikshaayen arastu par aadhaarit thim
 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa
 a study by the Royal Society of Newton declared that Newton was the true inventor and that Leibniz had committed fraud
 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations

 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton again began his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years
 unhone us prabhaav ke liye latin shabd gravitas kaa istemaal kiya jise gurutv ke naam se janaa jaataa he or saarvatrik gurutvkarshan ke niyam ko paribhaashit kiya
 In this work, he presented the first analytical proof of the speed of sound in air, based on Boyle's law
 bahut adhik duuri par kriya kar sakane vaale ek adrishy bal kii newton kii avadharana kii vajah se unki aalochana hui, kyonki unhone vigyaan main "gupt agenciyon" ko mila diya tha
 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views
 unhone ek pandulipi jon loke ko bheji jisamen unhone trinity ke astitv ko vivaadit mana tha, jise kabhi prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window
 1696 main newton shahi taksaal ke warden kaa pad sanbhaalane ke liye landan chale gaye, yah pad unhen rajkosh ke tatkaaleen kuladhipati, helifax ke pehle arl, charles montagu ke sangrakshan ke madhyam se praapt hua
 He took over as the chief currency mover of England, somehow dancing at the behest of Master Lucas

 In "la of Queen Anne" as master of the mint in 1717, Newton inadvertently established the pound sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard, establishing a metallic relationship between silver money and gold coins in favor of gold
 Changed
 is kaaran se chaandi sterling sikke ko pighla kar britain se baahar bhej diya gaya
 Newton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Academic des Sciences

 In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit at Trinity College, Cambridge
 yah nite kii padavi newton ko taksaal ke master ke rup main apni sevaao ke liye nahin di gayi thi or na hi unke vaigyanik kaary ke liye di gayi thi balki unhen yah oopaadhi may 1705 main sansadeey chunaav ke dauraan unke rajanithik yogadan ke liye di gayi thi
 Newton died in London on 31 March 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey
 unki aadhi-bhatiji, catherine barton konduit, ne landan main jarmin street main unke ghar par saamaajik maamalon main unki paricharika kaa kaam kiya; ve uske "bahut pyaare ankal" the, aisa zikr unke us patr main kiya gaya he jo newton ke dwaara use tab likhaa gaya jab vah chechak kii beemaari se ubar rahi thi
 In his final years, Newton, who had no children, took over most of his property by his relatives and died intestate
 unki mrityu ke baad, newton ke sharir main baari maatra main paara paaya gaya, jo shaayad unke rasinic vyavsaay kaa parinaam tha
 Mercury poisoning may explain the eccentricities in Newton's last life
 french ganitagya joseph louis lagrange aksar kehete the ki newton mahanatam pratibhashali tha or ek baar unhone kaha ki vah "sabase zyada bhaagyashaalee bhi tha kyonki ham duniya kii pranali ko ek se zyada baar sthapit nahin kar sakate
" angreji kavi alexander pope ne newton kii uplabdhiyon ke dwaara prabhavit hokar prasiddh smriti-lekh likhaa: Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night; God said "let Newton be" and all was light
 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries
 baad kii vyakhya uski khojon par kai anya vivaadon ke saath bhi upyukt he, jaisaa ki yah prashn ki kalan kii khoj kisne kii, jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he
 Later in history, Newton wrote: main nahin jaanata ki main duniya ko kis rup main dikhaai duungaa lekin apane aap ke liye main ek aisa ladkaa hoon jo samudr ke kinare par khel rahaa he or apane dhyaan ko ab or tab main laga rahaa he, ek adhik chikna pathar yaa ek adhik sundar khol dhundne kii koshish kar rahaa he, sachai kaa yah itnaa bada samudr mere saamne ab tak khoja nahin gaya he

 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"

 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day

 Chaloner's plan was to set up a fake conspiracy of Catholics and then turn them into hapless conspirators whom he held hostage
 chaloner ne apane aap ko paryaapt samrudh sajjan bana liya
 While applying in Parliament, the Chaloner also provided equipment for making fake coins in the mint
 He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the mint processes so that he could do something to improve it

 According to Newton's first law, an object which is in steady state will remain constant and an object which is in the same state of motion will move in the same direction with the same speed until an external force acts on it
 newton ke duusare niyam ke anusaar ek vastu par lagaaya gaya bal f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec{, samay ke saath iske samveg p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec{ main parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 In mathematical terms it can be expressed as follows chunki doosraa niyam ek sthir dravyaman kii vastu par lagu hota he,, pehla pad lupt ho jaataa he or twaran kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue pratisthaapan ke dwaara sameekaran ko sanketon ke rup main nimnanusaar likhaa ja saktaa he The first and second laws represent the breaking of Aristotle's physics, in which it was believed that a force was necessary to maintain motion
 ve rajya main vyavastha kii gati kaa ek uddeshy he rajya badalane ke liye hai ki ek hi shakti kii jarurat he
 The SI unit of force is named Newton in honor of Newton
 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward thrust of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun which the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii

 Quantum computer is a computer that directly uses quantum mechanical phenomena such as superimposition and quantum entanglement for its function
 pramaatra abhikalan kaa mul aadhaar yah he ki pramaatra gunon kaa upyog aankadon ke nirupan evam un par sankriyaayein karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Quantitative computers are different from traditional computers based on transistors
 iskaa saiddhanthik pradarsh he- pramaatra touring mashin, jise saarvatrik pramaatra sanganak bhi kaha jaataa he
 The theoretical similarity of quantum computers is with non-deterministic and probability based automatons
 aisi samanta kaa udhaaharan he- ek se zyada avasthaaon main ek saath rah paane kii kshamta
 Although quantum computation is still in its infancy, experiments have been conducted in which quantum computation operations have been performed on a very small number of cubits
 praayogic tathaa saiddhanthik donon prakaar ke anusandhan jari hai
 Many national governments and military funding agencies also support research on quantum computing to develop quantum computers for civil and national security purposes
 kwantum computer par purnankon kaa gunankhand karne ke liye polinomial time main chalane vaala ek algoridm gyaat he 
 But despite a lot of effort, non-quantum algorithms running in polynomial time have not been found
 is baat ne saidhantik computer vigyaan kii ek mahatvapurn pariklpana strong carch turing thisis par shankaa daal di he
 The Strong Church Turing thesis is a philosophical argument that states - The computational problem for which a computer can become an algorithm running in polynomial time, for that problem will also be an algorithm running in polynomial time on a classical computer; And for a problem that cannot be an algorithm running in polynomial time on a classical computer, it cannot be an algorithm running in polynomial time on any computer
 chunki purnankon ke gunankhand ke liye kwantum computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm he, strong carch turing thisis ke anusaar iske liye ek gaiyr-kwantum computer par bhi polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm jarur hoga
 Therefore, if one proves that a non-quantum computer for the factorization of integers cannot form an algorithm running in polynomial time, it would mean that the Strong Church Turing thesis is false

 This was particularly stimulated by the immediate court culture and Sanskrit literature
 sanskrit sahityashastra ke katipay anshon ne use shastreey anushaasan kii ore pravrutt kiya
 In Hindi, the word 'riti' or 'poetry' was used for poetry
 isliye kavyashastrabaddh saamaanya srujanpravriti or ras, alankaar aadi ke nirupak bahusankhyak lakshangranthon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is samay ke kavy ko 'reetikavy' kaha gaya
 The clearest signs of the old tradition of the poetic nature of this poetry are found in the adhikavya of Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhransh, Persian and Hindi, and the sringari tendencies of Krishnakavya
 is kaal main kai kavi aise hue hai jo acharya bhi the or jinhone vividh kavyangon ke lakshan dene vaale granth bhi likhe
 Shringar dominated in this era

 Most of the poets of Reetikal were courtiers
 keshavadas, pratap singh, bihari, matiram, bhushan, chintamani, dev, bhikharidas, raghunatha, benny, gang, tikaaram, gwaal, chandrasekhar bajpei, harnaam, kulapati mishra, nevaaj, surati mishra, kavindra udaynath, rishinath, ratan kavi, benny bandijan, benny praveen, brahmadatt, thakur bundelkhandi, bodha, gumaan mishra aadi or anek kavi to raja hi the, jaise- maharaj jaswant singh, bhagawant raay khichi, bhupati, rasanidhi, maharaj vishwanath, dwijadev 
 Ritikavya's work was started by a Sanskritist
 ye the acharya keshavadas, jinaki sarvaprasiddh rachanaayen kavipriya, rasikapriya or ramchandrika hai
 In Kavipriya, the ornamentation and rasikapriya have the illustrative representation of rasa

 This tradition of symptoms-goal-texts developed in Ritikavya
 ramchandrika keshav kaa prabandhkavy he jisamen bhakthi kii tanmayata ke sthaan par ek sajag kalakaar kii prakhar kalachetana prasphutit hui
 Several decades after Keshava, from the Chintamani to the eighteenth century, the Ajastra source of ritualism flowed in Hindi, with a very artistic expression of the delightful aspects of male-female-life and the Saras sensitivities of it
 reetikaal ke kavi raajaaon or raison ke aashray main rahete the
 There was a natural atmosphere of entertainment and artistry
 bauddhik anand kaa mukhya saadhan vahaan uktivaichitraya samajha jaataa tha
 Literature written in such an environment was mostly erotic and artistic
 par isi samay prem ke svachhand gayak bhi hue jinhone prem kii gaharaaiyon kaa sparsh kiya he
 Both in terms of quantity and poetry, this period's poetic euphemism of male-female love and beauty is important
 is samay virakavy bhi likhaa gaya
 The disturbance of the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb's clash with staunch communalism and aggressive politics led to the creation of Virakavya by some poets during this period
 aise kaviyon main bhushan pramukh hai jinhone reetistylee ko apanaate hue bhi veeron ke parakram kaa ojasvi varnan kiya
 At this time poetry related to policy, quietness and devotion was also written

 In this research work, non-modern compositions and anthropologies of this time are being found in abundance
 isliye reetikalin kavy ko nitant ekangi or ekarup samajhnaa uchit nahin he
 All the tendencies of the earlier periods are active in poetry of this time
 yah pradhan dhara shringaarakavy kii he jo is samay kii kavyasampatti kaa vaastavik nidarshak maani jaati rahi he
 Shringari poetry is divided into three sections
 pehla varg reetibaddh kaviyon kaa he jiske pratinidhi keshav, chintamani, bhikharidas, dev, matiram or padmakar aadi hai
 These poets have given artistic signs of love and beauty to the poetess by giving signs of rasa, ornamentation and heroine in couplets
 sanskrit sahityashastra main nirupit shastreey charchaa kaa anusaran maatr inamen adhik he
 But some have also shown some originality, such as Bhikharidas's representation of Hindi verses
 doosraa varg ritisiddh kaviyon kaa he
 These poets did not depict the symptoms, only based their poetry on them
 bihari inamen sarvshereshth hai, jinhone dohon main apni "satsai' prastut kii
 Extremely expressive aesthetics with different postures and unique expressions of love are found in his poetry
 tisare varg main ghanaanand, bodha, dwijadev thakur aadi reetimukt kavi aate hai jinhone svachhand prem kii abhivyakti kii he
 His compositions have a very impressive euphemism of intensity and intensity of love
 reetikavy mukhyat: maansal shringaar kaa kavy he
 It has a beautiful opening to the delightful sides of male and female life
 adhik kavy muktak style main he, par prabandhkavy bhi hai
 In these two hundred years, Shringarakavya had an extraordinary rise
 par dhire dhire reeti kii jakad badhati gai or hindi kavy kaa bhavakshetra sankeern hota gaya
 By coming to the modern era, the attention of writers was particularly attracted to these two shortcomings

 " padmakar ne ek hi chand main tatkaaleen darbaron kii ruparekha kaa ankan kar diya he- Aihalakita, adornment, heroine discrimination and ornamentation are the salient features of this era
 praayah sab kaviyon ne braj-bhashaa ko apanaaya he
 Less well-written independent poetry, Rasa, Alankar et cetera while writing the characteristics of Kavyangas as an example - especially as an example of adornments and stimuli - Saras compositions were written in this era
 bhushan kavi ne vir ras kii rachanaaen bhi deen
 The art-side was more prosperous than the sentiment
 shabd-shakti par vishesh dhyaan nahin diya gaya, na naatayashastra kaa vivechan kiya gaya
 The subjects became hesitant and originality began to decline
 is samay anek kavi hue— keshav, chintamani, dev, bihari, matiram, bhushan, ghanaanand, padmakar aadi
 Of these, Keshav, Bihari and Bhushan can be considered as the representative poets of this era
 bihari ne dohon kii sambhaavnaaon ko purna rup se viksit kar diya
 You can be considered a representative poet of rituals

 While Sapru criticized Mahatma Gandhi's leadership on the one hand, on the other hand he played the role of a mediator in the gandhi-irwin pact

 Forensic toxicology is that part of crime research that investigates the cause of death with the help of toxicology and analytical chemistry! The important task of this branch of forensic science is to find out which poisonous substance is the cause of death of the person and how long it has been since he entered the body! This branch examines the dead body of any person, whether it is a criminal or a suicide, and determines the presence of poison in the body and its quantity
 If any physical evidence is found in any criminal place then it is also investigated with pleasure! Many substances of the body are taken in this branch, which are helpful to test poisons and chemical poisons
 In this branch, pesticides, herbicides, botanical toxins, alcohol, morphine, narcotic substances, petrol, gasoline and all other possible chemical matters are tested

 pigambar mohammad kii 632 isvi main mrityu ke baad vaale caliph puure muslim kshetra ke rajnatik netaa maane jate the
 The caliphate finally ended in 1925 at the end of the Osmani Empire
 arabi main 'caliph' shabd kaa matlab 'pratinidhi' yaa 'uttaradhikari' hota he
 After the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, those who took over the political reins of the entire Muslim world were called 'khalifa Rasool Allah', that is, 'heir of Allah's Rasool'
 jis tarah 'rais' ke raaj ko 'riyasat', 'amir' ke raaj ko 'emirate' or 'khan' ke raaj ko 'khaanat' kehete the, usee tarah 'caliph' ke raaj ko 'kilaafat' kaha jaataa tha
 Pay attention to the pronunciation of the letter 'kh' in 'khalifa' as it is slightly different from 'kh' with no dot
 iskaa uccharan 'karaab' or 'kareed' ke 'kh' se miltaa he
 The first four caliphs after the death of Prophet Muhammad are called 'rashidi Khalifa', a follower of the Sunni faith, which is also known as 'khalifa ur-rashidun' in Arabic accent and 'khalifa-e-rashidin' in Persian accent
 'raashid' kaa matlab arabi main 'sahi maarg par chalane vaala' hota he
 These four caliphs were as follows: Abu Bakr as-siddiq, Umar ibn al-khatab, Usman ibn Affan and Ali ibn Abu Talib
 yah chaaron mohammad sahab ke jeevankaal main unke saathi rahe the
 Immediately after the passing of Prophet Muhammad, Abu Bakr was chosen as the Caliph by mutual dialogue and Muhammad's companions swore loyalty to him
 is chunaav se kuch log naaraaz hue kyonki unhen laga kii ali hi pigambar ke sabase qareebi sambandhi the isliye unhen hi caliph bananaa chahie tha
 Abu Bakr's rule lasted only two years from 632 to 634 that he fell ill and came to death
 dehanth se pehle unhone bina vichaar-vimarsh ke umr ko caliph bana diya
 The loyalty of Umar was sworn by only those fellows who were in Medina at that time, from which some other comrades started to ignore him as a caliph
 us samay arabon ne islam failaane ke liye iran par hamalaa kiya or is se krodhit hokar kuch iraniyon ne umr ko satta lene ke lagbhag 10 varshon baad 7 navambar 644 isvi ko maar daalaa
 Omar had already formed a group of six people, out of which he had to choose a caliphate by mutual agreement
 isamen ali or osman shaamil the
 Osman was elected and became the third Khalifa on 11 November 644
 lagbhag 12 saal baad 17 july 656 ko kuch vidrohiyon ne unki bhi hatya kar di or ali ko chauthaa caliph chunaa gaya
 Shia followers hold that the rule of the first three caliphs was illegitimate and that Ali should have been the caliph from the beginning as he was also a family relative of the Prophet and also the husband of his daughter Fatimah
 jab ali caliph bane to bahut updrav or viroh hue
 The biggest challenge came from Mu'awiyah, the governor of Damascus, a relative of Osman, and whose sister was married to the Prophet Muhammad
 muawiyah kaa kahana tha kii ali unke sambandhi osman ke qaatilon ko pakad nahin rahe hai
 He waged a 'war of Siphin' with Ali's forces on the banks of the Furat River in which no one was defeated or defeated
 koon-karaaba rokane ke liye ali muawiyah se baatcheet karne ko raji ho gaye
 Ali's forces consisted of a group of 4,000 radicals called 'khariji' and strongly held that the decision to win and win is in the hands of God and this war should not be stopped till death
 ve ali ko sahi maarg se bhatakane kaa doshi maanate hue unase alag ho gaye
 Nearly two years later, in the 'war of Naharwan' Ali had to fight the Kharijites in which Ali won
 iske baad ek din vah kufa ke masjid main namaaz pard rahe the jab unpar 'ebn muljam' naam ke ek kaariji ne zehar mali hui talwaar se hamalaa kiya
 They passed
 unke do beton - hasan or hossain - main se ek ko caliph chunaa janaa tha, kyonki pigambar mohammad donon ke naanaa the or ali ne nirdesh diya tha ki unke baad kaa caliph pigambar ke gharaane kaa hi hona chahie
 Hasan was made the sixth Khalifa, but soon after he became the Khalifa, Mu'awiyah started inciting his forces against him
 hasan or muawiyah ke bich yuddh kii surat ban ai
 To prevent the Muslim community from dividing, Hasan compromised that he would relinquish the throne of the Caliphate and accept Mu'awiyah as the Caliph provided that after the death of Mu'awiyah, the throne was returned to Hasan or his successor
 muawiyah saatva caliph to ban gaya lekin uski marzi thi ki uske baad uskaa betaa yazid caliph bane
 Mu'awiyah is said to have instigated a wife of Hasan and fed poison to Hasan, from whom Hasan died
 jab 680 main muawiyah mara to uske bete yazid ne aathva caliph banane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Ali's second son Hussain refused to believe it
 10 oktober 680 main 'kerbala kaa yuddh' hua jisamen hossain ko gardan katkar maaraa gaya
 Then his 6-month-old son was killed and the women of his family were insulted
 har saal shiya log muharram main in ghatnaon kaa matam maanate hai
 Umayyad Khilafat started with Mu'awiyah and Yazid

 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 iske baad sar ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko "gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa maan hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutveey sthiraank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Suppose the code of the Earth is m and there is a body with the code m on its surface
 prithvi kii sanhati yadi uske centre par hi sanghanit maani jaae or prithvi kaa ardhavyas r ho to prithvi dwaara us pind par kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal : According to Newton's Second Movement, the force exerted on a body is equal to the product of the body and acceleration of that body
 at: prithvi ke aakarshan ke prabhaav main mukt rup se giranevaale pind par kaary karanevaala gurutvkarshan bal: Where g is the accelerated acceleration of that body , so arthath g= pind kii ikai sanhati par kaary karanevaala bal
 But from the equation atev gurutvajanit twaran g ko bahudhaa ‘prithvi’ ke gurutvkarshan kii tivrata bhi kehete hai
 The problem of finding the value of gravitation constant g attracted the attention of scientists only after Newton's law of gravity was presented

 Initially, only gas powered devices were made, but now some years electric powered refrigerators have become popular

 They are coated with a layer of porcelain and a thick effluent coating on the outside
 bhinn bhinn maadlon kii keemat ke anusaar prashithitr kii deevaaron main laga ooshmaarodhak 2 se 4 inch tak motaa hota he
 The thicker the insulator, the more effective it will be, because the heat of most of the atmosphere is passed through the walls into the food

 Therefore, a good refrigerant must have the following qualities: ammonia gas, sulfur doiaksaide, carbon dioxide, dychlor-dyphlor-mithen pramukh gaisen hai, jinka upyog prashithan main hota he
 The principle of refrigerators operated only by ice and by the device is virtually the same, because in both of them the heat of the food is only absorbed by the physical change of the medium
 pehle main to barf pighalkar pani ban jaataa he, or duusare main prasheetak drav, yantra ke dwaara gas se parinat ho jaataa he
 Multifunctional refrigerators are made in such a way that air is transported from the underside of the ice blocks and the ice is at fault

 Then one of these passes through the special valve and returns to the evaporator

 One is the diffusion valve, by which the condensed refrigerant enters the evaporator, disintegrating as a fine spray and causing it to form, in part, the vapor
 duusare prakaar kaa plav kapaat he, jo vaashpitra ke bheetar kaaphi maatra main prasheetak-drav ikattha hone par apana kaam karata he or tabhi kriyachakra kaa punaravartan hota he
 In refrigerators operating on the principle of absorption, ammonia gas easily dissolves in cold water and also escapes easily when the water is heated
 at: pani ko garam karne ke liye tel yaa gas kii jwaala kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 When separated from the water, the ammonia gas is liquefied in the condensation coils and flows into the evaporator, where the pressure of the condenser through hydrogen is reduced so much that the liquid starts evaporating again
 phir, vaashpitra se hydrogen or ammonia gas kaa mishran avasorak prakoshth main jyonhi pahunchataa he, usamen pani kii ek baarik phuhaar milti he
 This causes the ammonia gas to dissolve in water and return to the insoluble hydrogen vapor in water

 Due to the constant exchange of heat and coolness in this type of device, its design becomes very complicated, but the functionality of the device remains good
