 Members of the party other than the BJP, however, did not attach any special importance to Sushma's statement that this is a question of the dignity of Parliament, so the Chief Minister of the state should be summoned immediately and made to stand in the box of Parliament

 Prabha raised the matter related to Kishore and said that the condition of fellow MP is so serious that he is not able to speak on his own

 The statement given after the Pulwama terror attack has increased the difficulties of Navjot Singh Sidhu, a minister in the Punjab government
 virdohi dal to unke khilaaf pehle se morcha khole hi baithe hai, ab unheen kii party ke netaa or punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne bhi siddhu ke bayaan se kinaaraa kar liya he
 Amarinder Singh called it a personal statement of Sidhu and he said that the Congress party's line is different on this
 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne kaha ki loktantr main sabhi ko apni baat kehane kaa adhikaar he or kisi ko roka nahin ja saktaa
 He said that Sidhu was asked not to go to Pakistan even during the Kartarpur corridor but he did not agree
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki congress kaa stand isse alag he or party is mudde par ekajute he
 The Congress leader said that i have been a soldier and Sidhu has been a cricketer, so Sidhu cannot understand the feelings of the soldiers
 unhone kaha ki main sena main rahaa hum or mujhe pataa he ki javaanon kii shahadat kya hoti he, lekin siddhu javaanon kaa dard nahin samaj sakate
 Sarkar Kaptan Amarinder Singh said that Sidhu is a cricketer and the Prime Minister of Pakistan is his friend, he used to play cricket with him, maybe his thinking may be different on this issue
 lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki unke man main pulavama hamale ko lekar dukh na ho, puri punjab kii janata isko lekar dukhi he or chaahati he ki koi kadaa kadam uthaaya jaae
 On the question of Pakistan and terrorism, the Captain said that the Jaish guides Mohammed A
 Mohammed
 iesai ke chif he general bajva jinhone imran khan ko pradhanmantri mantri banaaya he, aise main saaf he ki jaish kaa har kadam pakistan sarkaar ke ishaaron par hota he
 What was the statement of Sidhu, condemning the Pulwama terror attack, Navnjot Singh pointed to talks with Pakistan
 unhone kaha tha ki aatank kii koi jati, majahab, desh yaa dharm nahin hota he
 He said that the terrorists who carried out the attack needed to get answers
 siddhu ne kaha tha ki aatankwaad kaa sthaayee hal khoja janaa chahie
 In the Punjab Assembly on Monday, Sidhu's statement created a furore and Akali Dal mps demanded his resignation
 bajet satr ke dauraan vidhansabha main siddhu ke khilaaf jamkar narebaaji hui or unki photo jalaai gai
 After this, Sidhu came out and took the BJP into the dock and asked the question who left the terrorists after Kandahar in 1999
 siddhu ke is bayaan ke baad congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha tha ki yah pakistan ke saath baatcheet kaa vakt nahin he
 It would be stupid to talk about the conversation
 hamaare javaanon kii shahadat bekaar naa jaae iske liye hamen kade kadam uthaane chahie
 Let us tell you that 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in the terrorist attack on 14 February in Jammu and Kashmir
 upi main ek ped kaatane ke liye lagane honge das paudhecabinet meeting main liya gaya mahatvapurn faislamumbai main aare jangalon kii kataai ko lekar kaaphi bavaal hua tha
 The case is in the month of October when the then Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was there
 metro ke badale main ped kii kataai rashtriya mudda ban gaya tha
 Taking a lesson from this incident in UP, the Yogi government has given a unique decision
 agar kisi ko ek ped kaatna he to badale main use das paudhe lagane honge
 Not only this, the UP government has also issued guidelines regarding which trees will be planted
 darasal somvaar ko upi sarkaar ne cabinet kii meeting main yah mahatvapurn faisla liya he
 The order states that no person will be allowed to cut trees without planting 10 saplings
 yani ek ped 10 paudhe or 10 ped to 100 paudhe
 The Yogi government has also identified 10 plants from the environmental point of view - plants like Peepal, Mahua, Neem, Sal and Mango
 yani ki bade or chhayedar paudhe
 The Yogi government, after this order, wants to ensure a clean environment
 sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha he ki agar kisi vyakti ke paas apni zamin nahin he to vah paudha van vibhaag kii jameen par laga sakate hai
 But a person cannot be allowed to cut trees without planting saplings
 jaahir he paryaavaran ko surakshit banaae rakhane ke liye yogi sarkaar kaa yah faisla ek acha faisla he
 However, detailed instructions are yet to be given regarding serious things like maintenance of these plants etc
 bataa den ki mumbai main ped kataai ko lekar jari virodh ke baad kendriya paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne mumbai kii aare colony main prayek ped ke badale main paanch paudhe lagane kii baat kahi thi

 aage padhein, kaise college kaa rasta bhul gaye tomars
 । 
 Delhi's Law Minister Rahejitendra Singh Tomar, who is surrounded by fraudulent allegations, has started getting the reality check of the police
 police tomars ko lekar har us thikaane tak ja rahi he, jahaan se unhone padhai karne or digriyaan hasil karne kaa daawa kiya he
 But Tomar is seen failing in the reality test of these locations
 kisi teacher kaa padhaayaa student agar kisi soobe kaa mantri ban jaae to apane us student se milakar teacher kii manodasha kisi hoti hogi? or mantri bhi aisa-vaisaa nahin balki dilli kii sarkaar main kanoon mantri
 But when Jitendra Singh Tomar returned to Delhi as Minister of Law in Saket Degree College, Faizabad, he met his teachers, neither the teacher got emotional nor did Tomar saheb have any effect
 paanv chune or gale lagane kii baat to dur rahi
 Tomar did not know that the way of the college, Guruji did not recognize his student nor did his teacher
 sutron kii maane to guuruuvaar ko tomars kaa unke jamaane main college main padhaa chuke kai shikshakon yahaan tak ki ek principal se bhi aamanaa-saamana hua, lekin koi bhi ek-duusare ko nahin pahchaan sakaa

 Now the MLA who is so confused about his degree himself during the two-two elections held in just two years, is bound to doubt that
 aam aadmi party ke vidhayak vishesh ravi farji degree ke is khel kaa sabase taaja cheharaa hai
 Just like Jitendra Singh Tomar and Commando Surendra, Special Ravi is also accused of having given a false affidavit of his education while contesting the 2013 assembly elections
 wo graduate hai hi nahin or khud ko graduate bataa rahe the
 In fact, when the specials filed their nominations for the elections in 2013, they declared themselves graduates from Chaudhary Charan Singh University, but when they filed their nominations in 2015, they said that they were studying for graduation from Indira Gandhi Open University, ie IGNOU
 Somewhere plus tu yani inter kii padhai kahaan se kii, iskaa pataa nahin
 That is to say that the first time graduation was false

 Commando also stuck in degree, so is Aam Aadmi Party MLA Commando Surendra's graduation degree also forged? The university from which he talks about his passout has said something similar in response to the RTI and if the commandos Surendra could not prove their degree right in the time they got from the court, then it is possible that they too may be like Tomar Be it only karthik aryan (kartik Aryan) or sara ali khan (sara Ali Khan) in dinon apakaming film 'lav aaj kal 2 (love Aaj Kal 2)' kii taiyaari main lage hue hai

 Ajmer Superintendent of Police Rajesh Meena, who caused the entire system in such a manner, was removed from the list sent to Delhi, but his arrest last week raised many questions
 bhrashtachar nirodhak beuro (asibi) ke dal ne meena ko uske sarkari nivas par hi jile ke thanon se maheenaa lekar aae dalal jodhpur nivasee ramdev thathera ke saath pakadaa
 But another IPS Ajmer Additional Superintendent of Police (city) Lokesh Sonwal escaped from the spot and has been absconding since then
 meena ke giraftaar hote hi jile main chaiyn sneching, jua, sattebaaji or lootkhsot jaise aparaadhon main achaanak kami aa gai
 There was a huge recovery every month from the people involved in these crimes
 iji (ajmer range) anil paliwal ne press conference kar kaha ki ek hafte main control room ko kisi bade aparaadh kii khabar nahin mili he
 According to the ACB, Meena was identified with pot merchant Ramdev Thathera during his posting in Jodhpur
 baad main thathera meena kaa najdiki ban gaya or uske liye vasuuli karne laga
 In the same sequence, on 2 January, he was recovered from various police stations in Ajmer
 sabhi thane vaale use jaanate the or rakam chupchaap de dete the
 The ACB had been monitoring Meena and Thathera's phone calls for three months
 3 janvari kii dopaher rupayon se bhare bag ke saath use meena ke awaas par pakadaa gaya
 3 lakhs from his bag
 or uske ghar par 2 lakh ru
 Recovered more than meena ke awaas par aane se purv thathera sonwal ke yahaan gaya tha
 He got out as soon as the matter opened
 beuro kii talaashi main uskaa ghar uphaar kii mahangi chizon se ata mila
 The money received from Meena's house revealed the amount taken from the police stations for the month
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki meena ne chah maheene main hi 800 sipaahiyon ke tabadale kiye or baad main 400 ke nirast kar die
 There was a talk of taking high money for putting Ci on stations like the district's clock tower, Christianganj
 thanon se moti rakam lene ke baad unhen khulaa haath de diya jaataa tha
 On being sent to jail, Meena complained of ill health and was referred to Jaipur
 jis andaaj main meena esemes aspataal pahunchaa or jis paimaane par emarai samet dheron test kii sifarish kii gai, use dekhte hue meena ke saath doctoron kii mileebhagat kii jaanch bhi asibi ko kerani chahie
 If he was suffering from such serious diseases then why not get treatment for so many years? Although he has now been discharged and sent to Central Jail, he claims that he will be found immaculate in the investigation
 or sonwal! kuch bilderon or sattebaaji se jude johariyon se uske rishton kii jaanch kii jarurat he
 Jaipur Mayor Jyoti Khandelwal has released a list of hundreds of such buildings, which were approved by Sonwal by relaxing the bilge while in Jaipur Municipal Corporation
 isaki bhi jaanch kii maang kii ja rahi he
 Now there is a demand for a fresh investigation into the probationary IPS Ajay Singh's case too
 unhen bhi rishwatakhori ke aarope main pakadaa gaya tha or jo philhal jamaanat par hai
 It is now feared that he may have refused to be part of a well-organized system of bribery and targeted by the strong lobby of businessmen who have links with IPS officers
 taaja maamle ne iji paliwal kii kshamtaaon par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 Such incidents are happening continuously in his area
 isi guuruuvaar ko asibi ne ajmer ke exise depo ke manager rajendra singh jaisinghania ko 10,000 ru
 Caught up with the bribe

 But serious questions also arise against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Minister of State for Home Virendra Beniwal and state DGP Harishchandra Meena
 ugaahne waalon kii fouj banate police tantra par lagaam kas paane main ve naakaam sabit hue hai
 Meena was not sending the money to the above officers? Apart from all the IAS / RS, the state government may have to conduct raids at doctors, engineers, Jaipur Development Authority, officials of city development trusts and middlemen

 At night, while talking to Jarim on the phone, Niyati's phone, which was traveling along in the train, fell down
 jarim ne ye baat mujhe bataai tab maine use mobile phone khojane ke liye raat main patari par jane se manaa kiya tha
 But both did not agree
 police ke mutabik niyati ke haath se phone santakruj or khaar ke bich main gira tha isaliye khaar stesan par pahunchate hi donon duusari taraf se patari par utar kar santakruj kii taraf chalane lage
 Then another train coming from Churchgate hit him
 shaq he ki niyati kaa phone danda maarane se gira hoga
 Because there are many places on the railway tracks in Mumbai where Danda Maar gangs are active
 wo raat main khambhe par khadey rahakar daravaaje par safar kar rahe yatriyon ke haath par danda maarthe hai

 Looking at the results so far in the ODI series against Australia, it has become difficult to say how Team India will lead the way to victory in the last match
 agar shanivaar ko hone vaale sidney vanade main team india jeet hasil nahin kar paati he, to uski vanade ranking duusare se tisare number par to khiskegi hi saath hi team ko kai bade badlaavon ke daur se guzarana pad saktaa he
 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar has also been seen in favor of major changes in the team
 kai khilaadiyon ke sir par talwaar latak rahi he
 Currently, captain MS Dhoni has taken the responsibility of the defeat in Canberra, but despite losing 0-4 in the series, this match has become a do or die issue for the players
 canberra main haar ke fouran baad captain dhoni ne yah maanane main der nahin kii ki unke wicket kaa janaa hi match kaa terning point tha
 But now they will have to decide the victory in Sydney
 team india ke kai ballebaajon ne siries main bade record banaae hai, lekin team ko haar mili or uskaa record kharaab ho gaya
 There is also an error in batting that cannot be denied
 ballebaaji main kai nijee record banane ke baavjood team india kii gendbaaji badi phikr kii vajah bani hui he
 Not only the Indian team but also the bowlers of the host team believe that their challenge has increased more than before
 tippaniyan Australian fast bowler Ken Richardson says, "I think the batting is getting better and now the challenge before the bowlers is to find a way to get out
 " Veterans like former captain Sunil Gavaskar and Sanjay Manjrekar have raised questions about the young players and the attitude of the team along with the senior players
 phans ke jehan main ye sawaal bada banataa ja rahaa he ki kya vanade siries main vaaki team india ko 0-5 se haar kaa saamana karnaa padegaa? Former captain Sunil Gavaskar has also been seen in favor of major changes in the team

 phans ke jehan main ye sawaal bada banataa ja rahaa he ki kya vanade siries main vaaki team india ko 0-5 se haar kaa saamana karnaa padegaa? Shortly after the defeat in Canberra, captain Dhoni did not delay to believe that his wicket was the turning point of the match
 lekin ab unhen sidney main har haal main jeet kii surat tay kerani hogi
 Many batsmen of Team India have set big records in the series, but the team lost and its record was spoiled
 ballebaaji main bhi chook hui he isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Despite having many personal records in batting, the bowling of Team India remains a cause for great concern
 naa sirf bhartiya team balki mejabaan team ke gendbaaj bhi maanate hai ki unki chunauti pehle se zyada bad gai he
 The comments australia ke tej gendbaaj ken richardsan kehete hai, "mujhe lagata he ballebaaji behatar hoti ja rahi he or ab gendbaajon ke saamne chunauti he ki wo out karne kaa tarika dhundhen
 " purv captain sunil gavaskar or sanjay manjrekar jaise diggajon ne senior khilaadiyon ke saath team ke yuva khilaadiyon or team ke ravaiye ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye hai
 In the minds of the fans, the question is becoming bigger whether Team India will face 0-5 defeat in ODI series? ballebaaji main kai nijee record banane ke baavjood team india kii gendbaaji badi phikr kii vajah bani hui he

 march main bijepi ne upi main 2 'ladakon' ko haraaya tha or ab gujarat main 4 'ladakon' ko haraa diya
 Meanwhile, after the Gujarat result, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had taunted that 2 boys lost in UP and 4 boys in Gujarat

 He was referring to the fifth boy about himself
 unke is bayaan ke baad ummid lagaai ja rahi he ki vah bhavishya main phir se congress ke saath aa sakate hai
 The saffron party led by Narendra Modi is winning elections continuously in the country and the Congress resorted to 3 rebel boys in Gujarat to stop its victorious chariot

 While Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani submitted his candidature from Vadgam seat in Banaskantha district

 duusari ore, gujarat main aae parinaam ke baad uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne kaha, "gujarat main yah vikaas kii jeet he, narendra modi ke netritv kii jeet he"
 He advised the opposition parties to stay away from the next general election, saying, "after the results that have come out of Gujarat, now the opposition should forget the 2019 general election and prepare ahead
 "unhone congress ke nae adhyaksh rahul gandhi or hardik patel par tanj karte hue kaha, "uttar pradesh ke chunaavon main to 2 yuva chunaav lade the or donon haare gaye, lekin gujarat main chaar yuva chunaav haare hai
