 There is no one ideal language accepted by everyone of the Mongol race living in these vast areas
 parantu tathakthith mongolia ke andar janatantr mongol kii halha boli dhire-dhire adarsh bhashaa kaa pad grahan kar rahi he
 The people of Mongolia themselves consider this Halha dialect a sophisticated dialect and this dialect is likely to become an ideal language in the near future
 pracheen kaal main mongol lipi main likhi janevaali saahitiyik mongol padhe-likhe logon main adarsh bhashaa maani jaati thi
 But now this Mongol script has been abandoned by the Republic of Mongolia and a new Mongol script made from Russian script has been accepted in its place

 mongol sahitya kaa itihaas 13veen shatabdi ke madhya bhaag main bane mongolia ke rahasy kaa itihaas se aarambh hota he
 The so-called modern literature begins in the vicinity of the 1921 unrest, but until now the compositions of importance are not much
 aadhunik sahitya ke janm se purv 1920 tak kii saat shatabdiyon main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe gaye-mongolia ke rahasy kaa itihaas, gager khan kii katha or janagar The book titled "history of the Secret of Mongolia" has a history ranging from the birth of the Mongol race to the Chingis Khan and with special emphasis on the Chingis Khan
 yah bahut saral or sundar bhashaa main likhaa gaya he tathaa bich bich main kavitaayen bhi mili hui hai
 In it, the history of the Mongols of small weaker castes gathered together to form a central government, changed from a family oriented society to a Jagirdari society, and a small Jagirdar gathered to become a very strong country

 In this, the public fighting against the vassal and the priestly class has been praised

 In it, the emphasis is on the welfare and happiness of the public through the actions of a man

 Both are chronicles of Chingis Khan and his successors
 inamen pracheen mongol kii puranic kathaayen, lokthaayen aadi sankalit hai
 Modern literature has evolved from the people's revolution against the 1921 revolution and the Jagirdari system

 Founder of Dudhwa National Park, Billy, the father of the rehabilitation program of tigers and tendu, struggled throughout life in the protection and enhancement of the forests of Kheri district

 His experiments were discussed all over the world in the field of wildlife and today's tiger conservationists have been taking inspiration from his works

 Billy was the prince of the princely state of Kapurthala
 inkaa billy naam inaki buaa rajkumaari amrit cor ne rakhaa tha jo mahatma gandhi kii sachiv va nehru sarkaar main pratham mahila swasthya mantri rahi, aap kii shiksha-diksha british-raaj main hui, balrampur riyasat main inke pita ko bartania hukumat ne court-aaf-ward niyukt kiya tha, so inkaa bachapan balrampur kii riyasat main gujara
 The stories of their hunting in the forests of Balrampur were famous and at the age of 12, they hunted tigers
 raaj-parivaar va ek bade afasar ke putr hone ke kaaran aap ne oonche darje kaa ilm hasil kiya or british-bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gayi, dwitiya vishwa-yuddh ke baad inhone khiri ke jangalon ko apana baseraa bananaa sunshchit kar liya
 In the past, all the properties of his princely state were in Kheri and Bahraich, which were given by the British as rewards to their ancestors
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke uparant billy ne khiri ke jangalon ko apana ghar bana liya or yaheen rah kar pachaas varshon tak vanya jeev sarankshan main apana athulaneey yogadan diya, jo aaj puri duniya main ek misaal he

 Billy Arjan Singh died on 1 January 2010 at Jasvir Nagar farm near Palia in Lakhimpur Kheri
 is vakt billy kii umr 93 varsh thi
 Billy's jeep passed in front of a jeep in 1960 and his beauty in the jeep light in the dark night charmed Billy, it was the beauty of nature that Arjan Singh felt !! At the same time, he gave up hunting
 khiri main jangalon ke madhya rahane kaa va kheti karne kaa nishchay dudhwa neshnal park ke astitv main aane kaa pehla kadam tha
 The establishment of the Jasvir Nagar farm in the name of his father in 1946 and then of Tiger Howen in 1968, was the first sign of destiny that now these forests of Kheri would be able to survive, or else the British were transferred to independent India
 The vast forests of the country were going wildly, obviously we had taken independence, but our dependence was only on natural resources and perhaps even today! It was due to Indira ji that the rehabilitation of tigers and tendu became possible in Tiger Haven
 yah vah daur tha jab desh-videsh ke film-nirmaataaon main hode machi thi ki koun billy ke in anuthe prayogon par apni behtareen dacumentary bana le
 There was no talk of any sanctuary in India as much as Billy's private forest, which is known to Tiger Howen all over the world
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad is anterrashtriya shakhsiyat billy arjan singh ne british-bhartiya sena kaa daaman chhod khiri ke vishaal jangalon ko apana mustakabil bana liya or use ek khubasurat anjaam bhi diya, jise aaj ham dudhwa neshnal park ke naam se jaanate hai
 In the early days, he built a farm house in the name of his father Jasvir Singh on the road from Palia to Sampurnanagar and made farming his way
 kabhi shikari rah chuke billy jab ek din apni hathini par savaar ho jangal main daakhil hue to suheli or nevara nadiyon ke madhya bhaag ko dekhakar stabdh rah gayi, athulaneey prakritik soundarya se aachhadit thi ye dharti jiske chaaro taraf shakhu ke vistaarit van
 It was this watch that determined the presence of Tiger Haven
 san 1969 i0 main yah jangal billy ne kharid liya, jiske dakshin-uttar main saritaayen or pashchim-purv main ghaney van
 And here established tiger haven for tigers and tendu
 arjan singh ke nirantar prayaason se san 1977 main dudhwa neshnal park bana or fir tiger project kii shuruwat hui or is project ke tahat san 1988 main dudhwa neshnal park or kishanpur vanya jeev vihaar milakar dudhwa taigar rigerv kii sthapana kar di gayi
 Billy's contribution to preserving the reindeer in the Sathiana Range forests adjacent to Tiger Haven is memorable
 arjan singh hameshaa kehete rahe kii faresti department se wild-life ko alag kar alag vibhaag banaaya jaay, wild-life department! kyonki us jamaane main faresti department jangal bachaane ke bajaae kataane ke prayaas main adhik tha, sarkare jangalon kaa timber maffiaon ke dwaara inkaa vyavsaayee karan kar rahi thi
 If this separate department is made, then the people who join it will come after acquiring wildlife expertise
 jangalon kii tuutati shrankhlaayein billy ke liye chintaa kaa vishay rahi, kyonki baaghon kaa dayera bahut bada hota he or yadi jangal sikudte gayi to baagh bhi kam hote jaayenge! kabhi aadmi ke na rahane yogya is ilaake main "da colective farms and faresti limited ne 10,000 hectare junglee bhoomi kaa safaaya kar diya or log pakistan se aa aa kar basane lage, baad main bhudaan aandonlan main basaayen gayi logon ne ghaas ke maidaanon ko ganne ke kheton main tabdeel kar diya
 And the Dudhwa forest was transformed into a forest island
 jo billy ko sadaiv pareshaan karata rahaa
 After independence, the way people moved into this wild area and kept converting forest land into agricultural land, the reason is now erasing the existence of tigers and other creatures
 baaghon ke liye adhik sangrakshit kshetron kii unki khwis ke kaaran hi kishanpur vanya-jeev vihaar kaa vajood main aana hua jo ab dudhwa tiger rigerv kaa ek hissaa he
 Impressed by Jim Corbett and the FW Champion, Billy Arjan Singh wrote eight books which are the best accounts of this series of North India
 baagh va tenduon ke shavakon ko trend kar unhe unke prakritik awaas yani jangal main safalata purvak punervasit karne kaa jo kaary billy arjan singh ne kiya vah adwitiya he puure sansar main
 Prince, Harriet and Juliet were three of their tenders who were fully rehabilitated in the forest, later the tigress Tara, brought from the Zoo of England, also succeeded in making Dudhwa's forests their home
 iskaa natiza hai tara kii pidhia jo dudhwa ke wanon main fal-phul rahi hai
 Billy tried to discredit Tara as being a combination of Siberian or other breeds, and named it "genetic pollution", while genetic science suggests that geographic boundaries and interconnected species living in different environmental areas are not harmful
 Is rather better
 yadi aisa hota to koi angrej kisi asin desh main vaivaahik sambadh nahin sthapit karata or na hi asin kisi america yaa africa se
 In Indian tradition also, the matrimonial relationship is invalid and in science terms also, how the Siberian, Russian-born tigress has genetic pollution related to tigers of India
 in-bridigan ke khataron se bachane ke liye bhinn-bhinn samudaayon ke jeevon ke madhya sambadh sthapit karaate hai taaki unki jin-vividhita barkaar rahe or billy ne is prakaar dudhwa ke baaghon main yah vividhita kaayam kii
 In Dudhwa, Tara's hustle is growing steadily, the presence of an indo-siberian breed in the tigers of Dudhwa has also been considered as a scientific institution, but arrangements are being feared to be officially accepted
 yah sabit ho chukaa he, ki dudhwa ke jangal main baagh siberian-royal bengal tiger kii jin-vividhita ke saath is nasl ko or majboot bana rahe hai
 Due to this genetic diversity, the breed of Indian tigers will be better now
 nahin to sikud chuke jangalon main ye baagh aapas main hi sambadh kaayam karte


ek hi jin pool main xxrep 9 
 or in-breeding inaki nasl ko kamazor bana detii
 And then there is partial pollution kunwar billy arjan singh ne praathmik shiksha nainital ke filender smith college main grahan kii, madhyamik shiksha chrishchiyan college lakhanu va snaatak angreji main elahabaad vishvavidhyalay se kiya

 Documentation of children's development is usually done according to a BMI-K measured growth chart
 obesity kii pravriti kaa maapan, bachche ke BMI or chart par upasthit BMI ke bich antar ke aadhaar par kiya ja saktaa he
 However, this method again faces the constraints of body structure: many children develop primarily as endomorphs, they will be classified as obese regardless of their body organization
 Clinical professionals must take into account the physical structure of the child and use appropriate techniques such as densitometry, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, also known as DEXA or DXA

 In the United States, medical underwriting of private health insurance is widespread, with most private health insurance providers specifically using high BMI as a cut-off point, in order to increase insurance rates or provide higher risk patients
 By denying insurance, this apparently reduces the insurance coverage rate for all other customers in a 'normal' BMI range
 cat-of bindu kaa nirdhaaran har swasthya beemaa pradaata ke liye alag tareeke se kiya jaataa he or bhinn pradaata sweekaaryata ki alag range rakhte hai
 This may be in contrast to group insurance policies that do not require medical underwriting and where the acceptability of insurance is determined by being a member of the insurance group, which does not take into account BMI or other risk factors, it is a person Does not accept the health plan

 BMI is an inaccurate measurement of weight, says Eric Oliver, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, and academics and doctors have figured out an easier way to pressurize whether someone is an extra weight person or someone in need of change No and the American population is forced to fit these standards
 chikitsa sthapana ne saamanytah BMI kii kuch kamiyon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Because BMI is dependent only on weight and height, it makes simple assumptions about the distribution of muscle and bone weight and thus can over-estimate fat content in lean body people, while in a lean body
 May underestimate fat content

 One of them was a buffalo named Son Sagar, Son Sagar used to produce a golden child on the day of birth every year
 parantu vah sone kaa baccha kisi ko bhi dikhaai nahin detaa tha
 Raja Mahar Singh once declared that if a man shows him a sleeping child, he will give half of his kingdom, half of the cattle, and also marry his sister Khoilan
 kintu jo vyakti ko asafalataa milegi, use karagaar main daal diya jaayegaa
 Don't know how many Rawat Ahirs came but nobody got success
 sabhi kaa karagaar main band kar diya gaya
 Finally came three brothers - three brothers who were very young: Bada Kathaita - 12 years old, Selhan was 9 years old and the youngest Kaubiya who was only 6 years old
 raja ko bada du:kha hua, unhone teenon bhaiyon ko samajhane kii koshish kii "tum teenon bhaiyon kyon karagaar main janaa chaahate ho?" par teenon ne kaha ki ve kushish karenge ki unhen karagaar main na janaa pade
 After this, the three brothers started grazing the Son Sagar buffalo with other animals
 dekhte hi dekhte janmashtami kii raat aa gai
 Know what the three brothers did, Son Sagar tied the bell in the buffalo's neck
 raat badhati gai
 The buffalo went inside a puddle
 bada bhai kathaita bhens par na rakhaa or selhan or kaubia vahiin par so gaye
 But as the night progressed, Kathita also got a very loud sleep and he also slept
 son sagar bhens usee vakt dabre se nikalakar shiv mandir main chali gai
 Every year on the night of Janmashtami, Princess Khauilan used to come to worship in the same temple
 or jaise hi son sagar sone kaa bachche ko janam detii, rajkumaari khoilan use kalash kii tarah chadhaati thi
 She was blessed by Lord Shankar that she would find her husband on Janmashtami
 rajkumaari nahaane ja rahi thi
 As soon as the Son Sagar buffalo gave birth to a sleeping child, Princess Khouilan immediately hid it in her sari and then went to take a bath
 sone sagar bhens usee daber main waapas chali gai
 The cat was the first to open his sleep - he immediately went into the tomb and then was shocked
 selhan or kobia bhi neend khulte hi andar gaya or kathaita ko hairaan dekh hi samaj gaya
 What will happen now? The three brothers stood grief-stricken - after this, the catheter showed intelligence - she carefully grounded and began to see - this is the sign of Son Sagar's feet - so it means that she went out somewhere
 selhan or kobia us dabre ke bheetar hi dhund rahe the agar sone kaa baccha unhen vahi kahi mil jaye
 Here Kathaita walked along the footprint of Son Sagar, walked - when he reached the Shiva temple, he saw that Princess Khauilan was taking a bath
 kathaita ko laga ki rajkumaari kuch chipa kar le ja rahi thi
 She asked the princess, so the princess became very angry
 donon jaise jhagad hi rahe the ki achaanak sone kaa baccha gir gaya
 The princess suddenly remembered that Lord Shankar had given me a boon that i would get my husband here
 usne kathaita ko puri baat bataa di
 Kataita was very happy and reached the king with the sleeping child
 raja pehle to aashcharya chakit rah gayi - uske baad apana vachan puraa kiya
 In the same way, Kathaita and Khoilan got married

 lakki maravat pakistan ke kaibar-pakhtuunakva praant ke dakshini bhaag main sthit ek zila he
 It was once part of Bannu district, but on 1 July 1992 it was given the status of a separate district

 iske liye maravat qabeele waalon ne ek lagbhag lakh aadamiyon kii fuj taiyaar kar lee, jis se is sthaan kaa naam 'lakkhi maravat' padaa jo bigadakar 'lakki maravat' ban gaya
 The second story is that in ancient times its main city was founded by a Hindu merchant named Lakki Ram or Lucco Ram
 uske or maravat qabeele ke naamo ko jodakar 'lakki maravat' naam pad gaya
 In 1998, Lakki Marwat district had a population of 4,90,025 people

 kurukshetra yuddh kauravon or pandavon ke madhya kuru samrajya ke singhaasana kii prapti ke liye ladaa gaya tha
 According to Mahabharata, almost all the districts of India participated in this war
 mahabharat va anya vaidic saahitiyon ke anusaar yah pracheen bharat main vaidic kaal ke itihaas kaa sabase bada yuddh tha
 Millions of Kshatriya warriors were killed in this war, which resulted in the collapse of Vedic culture and civilization
 is yuddh main sampoorn bharatvarsh ke raajaaon ke atirikt bahut se anya deshon ke kshatriya veeron ne bhi bhaag liya or sab ke sab vir gati ko praapt ho gayi
 As a result of this war, India lacked both knowledge and science as well as heroic Kshatriyas
 ek tarah se vaidic samskruti or sabhyataa jo vikaas ke charam par thi uskaa ekaek vinaash ho gaya
 The golden Vedic civilization of ancient India came to an end with the end of this war
 is mahaan yuddh kaa us samay ke mahaan rishi or darshanik bhagwaan vedavyas ne apane mahakavy mahabharat main varnan kiya, jise sahasrabdiyon tak sampoorn bharatvarsh main gaakar evam sunakar yaad rakhaa gaya
 In the Mahabharata, there are accounts of the war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, mainly of two families of lunar dynasties
 100 kauravon or paanch pandavon ke bich kuru samrajya kii bhoomi ke liye jo sangharsh chalaa usase antat: mahabharat yuddh kaa srijan hua
 The said war is believed to have taken place around Kurukshetra in Haryana
 is yuddh main pandav vijayi hue the
 In the Mahabharata, this war has been called the Crusade, because it was a war fought for truth and justice
 mahabharat kaal se jude kai avshesh dilli main purana kila main mili hai
 Purana Qila is also called the fort of Pandavas
 kurukshetra main bhi bhartiya puraatatva surveykshan vibhaag dwaara mahabharat kaal ke baan or bhaale praapt hue hai
 7000-3500 years old submerged cities have been discovered on the west coast of Gujarat, which have been linked with references to Dwarka mentioned in Mahabharata, apart from the remains of Lakshagriha in Barnava, all these evidences prove the reality of Mahabharata
 
 mahabharat yuddh hone kaa mukhya kaaran kauravon kii ucch mahatvakankshaayen or dhritarashtra kaa putr moh tha
 The Kauravas and the Pandavas were siblings
 vedavyas ji se niyog ke dwaara vichitraveery kii bharya ambika ke garbh se dhritarashtra or ambalika ke garbh se pandu utpann hue
 Dhritarashtra gave birth to a hundred sons from Gandhari's womb, Duryodhana being the eldest
 pandu ke yudhisthir, bhim, arjuna, nakul, sahadev aadi paanch putr hue| dhritarashtra janm se hi netraheen the atah unki jagah par pandu ko raaj diya gaya jisase dhritarashtra ko sadaa pandu or uske putron se dwesh rahane laga
 This malice flourished as Duryodhana and Shakuni made ghee in this fire
 shakuni ke kehane par duryodhana ne bachapan se lekar laakshagrih tak kai shadyantra kiye
 But every time he failed
 yuvavastha main aane par jab yudhisthir ko yuvaraj bana diya gaya to usne unhen laakshagrih bhijwakar maarane kii koshish kii parantu pandav batch nikle
 In the absence of the Pandavas, Dhritarashtra made Duryodhana the crown prince, but when the Pandavas returned and sought their kingdom back, they were given a ruined Khandav forest in the name of the state
 dhritarashtra ke anurodh par grihayuddh ke sankat se bachane ke liye yudhisthir ne yah prastaav bhi sweekaar kar liya
 The Pandavas built Indraprastha, the grand city of Indra's Amaravati Puri, with the help of Shri Krishna
 pandavon ne vishwavijay karke prachur maatra main ratna evam dhan ekatrit kiya or rajasuya yajna kiya
 Duryodhana could not see the progress of the Pandavas and with the help of Shakuni, he won his entire kingdom from Yudhishthira in gaming and humiliated Draupadi by attempting to disarm Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha
 sambhavtah isi din mahabharat ke yuddh ke beej pad gayi the
 Finally, after losing in gaming, the Pandavas had to accept confinement for 12 years and one year of exile
 parantu jab yah shart puri karne par bhi kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya
 So the Pandavas had to be interrupted to fight, but Shri Krishna suggested to do everything possible to stop the war
 tab shrikrishna pandavon kii taraf se kururajya sabha main shantidoot banakar gayi or vahaan shrikrishna ne duryodhana se pandavon ko keval paanch gaanv dekar yuddh taalane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 But when Duryodhana refused to give the Pandavas as much land as the needle point, Yudhishthira was eventually forced to fight
 is prakaar kauravon ne 11 akshuhinee tathaa pandavon ne 7 akshuhinee sena ekatrit kar lee
 After completing the preparations for the war, both the Kaurava and the Pandavas reached Kurukshetra, where this fierce battle was fought, that terrible and fierce exterminatorial war of Kurukshetra can be inferred from a verse in Bhishma festival of Mahabharata
 bhrata bhraataram tatra swasriyan na c matulah
 Even after fulfilling the condition of 12 years of life and 1 year of unknown life, when the Kauravas refused to give their kingdom to the Pandavas, the Pandavas were forced to fight
 parantu shrikrishna ne kaha ki yah yuddh sampoorn vishwa sabhyataa ke vinaash kaa kaaran ban saktaa he atah unhone yuddh rokane kaa har sambhav prayaas karne kaa suzav diya
 Sri Krishna said that Duryodhana must give one last chance, so Sri Krishna went on behalf of the Pandavas as a peacekeeper in the Kurujya Sabha and proposed to avoid war by giving Duryodhana only five villages in front of the Pandavas
 jab duryodhana ne pandavon ko sui kii nonk jitani bhi bhoomi dene se manaa kar diya to shrikrishna ne use samajhaayaa ki duryodhana ke is hath ke kaaran uske vansh or saathiyon ke saath-saath kai nirdosh logon ko yuddh kii bali chadhana padegaa
 Enraged at this, Duryodhana tried to make Sri Krishna a prisoner, but Shri Krishna used Maya to frighten everyone out of his vast form and left
 iske baad to yudhisthir ko yuddh karne ke liye vivash hona hi padaa
 At the same time, Lord Ved Vyas went to Dhritarashtra and said that your sons, by disregarding the talk of all the gurus, finally put up a great destructive war
 dhritarashtra ke yuddh kii sansuchana jaanane kii vinati karne par vedavyas ji ne unhe kaha ki yadi tum is mahayuddh ko dekhnaa chaahate ho to main tumhen divya drushti pradaan kar saktaa hoon
 Dhritarashtra said that the destruction of my family is to be done in it, so i will not see this war with my own eyes
 atah aap krupa karke aisi vyavastha kar den ki mujhe is yuddh kaa samachar miltaa rahe
 Hearing this, Ved Vyas called Sanjay and gave him a divine vision and said, “oh Dhritarashtra! i have given Sanjay a divine vision
 sampoorn yuddh kshetra main koi bhi baat aisi na rahegi jo isse chuphi rahe
 This will tell you the whole story of this great war
 ” itnaa kahkar vedavyas ji chale gayi
 When it was decided that there would be war, both sides started preparations for war
 duryodhana pichle 13 varshon se hi yuddh kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha, usne balram ji se gada yuddh kii shiksha praapt kii tathaa kathin parishram or abhyaas se gada yuddh karne main bhim se bhi acha ho gaya
 Shakuni turned most of the districts of the world in these years
 duryodhana karn ko apni sena kaa senapati bananaa chahta tha parantu shakuni ke samajhane par duryodhana ne pitamah bhishma ko apni sena kaa senapati banaaya, jiske kaaran bharat or vishwa ke kai janapad duryodhana ke paksh me ho gayi
 On the Pandavas side, only those districts were in favor of religion and Shri Krishna
 mahabharat ke anusaar mahabharat kaal main kururajya vishwa kaa sabase bada or shaktishaalee janapad tha
 All the districts of the world never made the mistake of going to war with Kurujya and maintained a cordial relationship
 at: sabhi janapad kuruon dwaara labhanvit hone ke lobh se yuddh main unki sahaayta karne ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 When the Pandavas and Kauravas asked for help from the Yadavas, Sri Krishna first vowed not to take up arms in the war and then said that "on one side i am alone and on the other side i have an Akshauhini Narayani army", now Arjuna and Duryodhana elect one of these Had to do
 arjuna ne to shrikrishna ko hi chunaa, tab shrikrishna ne apni ek akshuhinee sena duryodhana ko de di or khud arjuna kaa sarathi bananaa sweekaar kiya
 In this way, the Kauravas collected 11 Akshauhini and the Pandavas collected 7 Akshauhini army
 phir shrikrishna ne karn se milakar use yah samajhaayaa ki vah pandavon kaa hi bhai he atah vah pandavon kii taraf se yuddh kare, parantu karn ne duryodhana ke rin or mitrataa ke kaaran kauravon kaa saath nahin choda
 After this, on requesting Kunti, Karna promised not to kill Arjuna except for the remaining four of his sons when he got the opportunity
 idhar indra ne bhi brahman kaa vesh banaakar karn se uske kavach or kundal le liye
 Due to which the power of Karna was reduced and the enthusiasm of the Pandavas increased because Karna could not be killed by any diva due to that impenetrable armor
 pandavon or kauravon ne apni sena ke kramshah 7 or 11 vibhaag akshuhinee main kiye
 An Akshauhini consists of 21, 870 chariots, 21, 870 elephants, 65, 610 riders and 1,09,350 foot soldiers
 yah pracheen bharat main sena kaa maap hua karata tha
 Each chariot consists of four horses and their charioteer
 Each elephant sits on its elephant, and behind it is its assistant who curbs the elephant from behind the chair, its owner in the chair is fitted with a bow and arrow and with it his two companions There are those who throw spears
 Accordingly the number of people who ride on chariots and elephants are 2, 84, 323
 All the living beings in an Akshohini army - elephants, horses and humans - Mr
 Print 6, 34, 243 happen, so 18 akshauhini total number of all Jivdharion- elephants, horses and men in army-1, will be 14, 16, 374
 atharah akshuhiniyon ke liye yahi sankhya 11, 416 ,374 ho jaati he arthath 3, 93, 660 hathi, 27, 55, 620 ghode, 82, 67, 094 manushya
 Many types of weapons were used in the war of Mahabharata
 praas, rishti, tomars, lohamay kanap, chakra, mudgar, naraach, farse, gofan, bhushundi, shatghni, dhanush-baan, gada, bhaalaa, talwaar, parigh, bhindipal, shakti, musal, kampan, chaap, divyastra, ek saath kai baan chhodane vaali yantric mashine
 Weapons of ancient bronze age kaansya yug kii talwaar 1800 BC iron arrow piece found in excavation in Dadupur village of Lucknow ek saath kai baan chhodane vaali yantric mashine In ancient times, during the time of war, the commander had to make many arrays of army so that the enemy's army could be easily penetrated and the king and the chief generals could be captured or killed
 isamen apni sampoorn sena ko vyuh ke naam yaa gun vaali ek vishesh akruti me vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 With this type of array of composition, even the smallest army can appear to be huge and can face the largest army as in the battle of Mahabharata, only 7 Akshohini army of Pandavas proved this by facing 11 Akshauhini army of Kaurava
 Shown
 mahabharat ke 18 din ke yuddh main donon paksh ke senapatiyon dwaara kai prakaar ke vyuh banaaye gaye
 Which are as follows- chakravyuuh ke gathan kaa chithran Ancient Shilachitra depicting Abhimanyu entering the Chakra array yuddh kii taiyaariyaan purna karne ke baad kaurav or pandav donon dal kurukshetra pahanche
 The Pandavas made their halt near the banks of Hiranyavati River, far away from the Samantpanchak Tirtha, situated on the southern bank of the Saraswati River in the western region of Kurukshetra, and the Kauravas made a halt in the eastern part of Kurukshetra at a plain level a few miles away
 
 donon pakshon ne vahaan chikne or samtal pradeshon me jahaan ghaas or eendhan kii adhikta thi, apni sena kaa padaav daalaa
 Yudhishthira set up thousands of military camps near the banks of the Hiranyavati River not far from the ashrams of the Devandirs, Tirthas and Maharishi
 vahaan prayek shivi main prachur maatra main khaadya saamagree, astr-shastr, yantra or kai vaidya or shilpi vetan dekar rakhe gayi
 Duryodhana also made thousands of stops in the same way, only the siege of 5 plan was left for war between the two armies
 phir agle din praatah donon paksho kii senaayen ek duusare ke aamane-saamne aakar khadi ho gayin
 The Pandavas put their army stop near the Samantra Panchak Tirtha and the Kauravas made their stop seeing the best and level place
 us sangram main hathi, ghode or rathon kii koi gananaa nahin thi
 On the advice of Pitamah Bhishma, both parties gathered and made some rules of war
 unke banaaye hue niyam nimnlikhit hai- In this way, by making war rules, both parties presented for war
 pandavon ke paas saat akshuhinee sena thi or kauravon ke saath gyaarah akshuhinee sena thi
 The armies of the two sides stood facing east and west
 kauravon kii taraf se bhishma or pandavon kii taraf se arjuna sena kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe the
 Only the armies of both sides were standing in the circle of the area of only 5 plan of Kurukshetra
 yuddh se purv arjuna shrikrishna se apane rath donon senaaon ke madhya main le jane ko kehete hai jisase vah yah dekh le ki yuddh main use kin kin yoddhaon kaa saamana karnaa he
 When Arjun sees his Guru Drona, Pitamah Bhishma and other relatives in the battle field, he becomes very sad and sad
 vah shrikrishna se kahata he ki jinke liye ham ye saare rajbhog praapt karnaa chaahate hai, ve to yahan is yuddh kshetra main usee rajbhog kii prapti ke liye hamaare vipaksh me khadey hai inhen markar ham raaj praapt karke bhi kya karegein
 Therefore, i will not fight, saying that Arjuna sits on the back of the chariot with his bow, then Sri Krishna is situated in yoga and gives him knowledge of the Gita and says that what has come in the world will have to go one day or the other
 yah sharir or sansar donon nashwar hai parantu is sharir ke andar rahane vaala aatma sharir ke marane par bhi nahin marataa
 Just as a person renounces old clothes and wears new clothes, similarly, the soul also abandons the old body and takes on a new body
 Think of it as if all this nature is getting you done, you are just an instrument
 shrikrishna arjuna ko gyaan yoga,bhakthi yoga or karm yoga teenon kii shiksha dete hai jise sunakar arjuna yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he
 According to the Mahabharata and other mythological texts, this war led to the decline of Vedic knowledge and many other great dynasties along with the descendants of India
 mahabharat main varnit is yuddh ke kuch mukhya parinaam nimna likhit hai- Negative fruit sakaaratmak fal Based on the list of ancient dynasties given in Hindu traditions and Puranas and the astrological calculations given in other Vedic texts, the ancient Indian dynasty after Mahabharata period is the following in the historical chronology
 maudgalyayan naam ke kam se kam do vyakti hue hai, ek mahatma buddha ke shishy tathaa duusare vaiyaakaran
 Maudgalyayan was a contemporary disciple of Lord Buddha
 unke paanditya kaa parichay itane se hi mil jaataa he ki swayan bhagwaan buddha kabhi-kabhi apane upadesh ko swayan puraa na kar apane priy maudgalyayan athwa sariputra yaa anand ko use puraa karne kaa aadesh de dete the or pashchaat ve ukt shishyon dwaara die gaye upadesh kaa anumodan kar dete the
 Thus the sermon of Moggallan is found in many sources of Sutta Pitaka
 vinay pitak, mahavagg ke aadi main moggallan ke sanyas kaa varnan paaya jaataa he jo shramanon kii saadhnaaon ko samajhane ke liye bada upyogi he
 In 1851 AD, when Sanchi Stupas were excavated for the second time, a small stupa in which Moggallan and his companions Sariputra had received the remains
 ye bhashmaavashesh srilanka pahunch gaye the, jo ab vahaan se laakar pun: sanchi kii usee pracheen pahari par pratishthit kar die gaye hai
 The other Moggallans were Vyakaran
 unka banaaya hua pali vyakaran, kacchan vyakaran ke pashchaat nirmit hua he, kintu uski apeksha adhik sarvangpurn he
 For this reason, its promotion is also found more
 is vyakaran main 817 sutara hai, jinpar vruti bhi swayan karta kii likhi hui maani jaati he or us vritti par ek pachika naamak vyakhya bhi unheen kii banaai hui kahi jaati he
 In addition to the sutra text in this grammar, the inclusion of Dhanatpath, Ganapath Evadipath etc
 is also found
