 State Bank of India is the largest and oldest bank in India
 2 june 1806 ko kalakatta main 'bank of kalakatta' kii sthapana hui thi
 It got the charter after three years and was reorganized as Bank of Bengal on 2 January 1809
 yah apane tarah kaa anokhaa bank tha jo saajha stock par british bharat tathaa bengal sarkaar dwaara chalaaya jaataa tha
 Bank of Bombay and Bank of Madras started later
 ye teenon bank aadhunik bharat ke pramukh bank tab tak bane rahe jab tak ki inkaa vilay imperial bank of india main 28 janvari 1921 ko nahin kar diya gaya
 In 1941, the foundation of the first five-year plan was laid in which emphasis was laid on the development of villages
 is samay tak imperial bank of india kaa kaarobaar sirf shaharon tak simit tha
 Therefore, in view of rural development, a bank which has access to the villages and which benefits the rural masses, was conceived
 iske falswaroop 1 july 1944 ko state bank aaf india kii sthapana kii gai, jisame sarkaar kii hissedari 61

 During its inception, the State Bank had a total of 480 offices including branches, sub-branches and three local headquarters, which were made the headquarters of the Imperial Banks

 teen saal baad bank ko apana charter praapt hua or ise 2 janvari 1809 ko bank of bengal ke rup main punagarthit kiya gaya
 It is a bank and financial institution

 The practice of accepting a scheduled bank did not become a common man's habit
 parantu ek lambey samay tak, visheshkar us samay jab tak ki teenon presidency bainkon ko note jari karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha bank note tathaa sarkari jamaa-rashiyaan hi adhikanshat: bainkon ke nivesh yogya saadhan the
 The three banks functioned under the Royal Charter, which were revised from time to time
 prayek charter main share-puunji kaa praavdhaan tha jisamen se paanch-chauthai nijee taur par di jaati thi or shesh par prantiy sarkaar kaa swaamitv hota tha
 Board members overseeing the functioning of each bank were mostly proprietary directors representing the large European managing agency houses located in India
 shesh sadsy sarkaar dwaara namit praaia: sarkari karmchaaree hote the jinamein se ek kaa board ke adhyaksh ke rup main chayan kiya jaataa tha
 Initially, the business of banks was to redeem exchange bills or other negotiable private securities, maintain cash accounts and deposit and issue and circulate cash notes
 ek lakh rupe tak hi rin die jate the tathaa nibhaav avadhi keval 3 maah tak hoti thi
 Collateral for such loans were public securities commonly called company paper, bullion, treasury, plate, diamond-gems or "non-perishable goods" and no more than twelve percent interest could be charged

 But as far as the government is concerned, the main task of these three banks was to help the government in raising debt from time to time and to stabilize the prices of government securities
 bank of bengal, bombai tathaa madras ke parichaalan kii sharton main 1860 ke baad mahatvapurn parivartan hue
 With the passage of the Paper Currency Act of 1861, the right of the presidency banks to issue currency was abolished and from 1 March 1862, the Government of India got the original right to issue paper currency in uk-ruled India
 nai kagaji mudra ke prabandhan evam parichaalan kaa daayitv presidency bainko ko diya gaya tathaa bharat sarkaar ne rajkosh main jamaarashiyon kaa antaran bainkon ko un sthanon par karne kaa daayitv liya jahaan bank apni shakhaayen kholane vaale hon
 Till then there was no branch of the three Presidency Banks even though they had this right under their constitution
 parantu jaise hi teenon presidency bainkon ko rajkosh main jamaarashiyon kaa bina roak-tok upyog karne kaa aashwaasan mila to unke dwaara teji se un sthanon par bank kii shakhaayen kholana prarambh kar diya gaya
 By 1876, the branches, agencies and sub-agencies of the three presidency banks had expanded into major areas of the country and trade centers located in the hinterland of India
 bank of bengal kii 18 shakhaayen thim jisamen uskaa mukhyalay, asthaayee shakhaayen, tathaa up-abhikaran shaamil hai jabaki bank of bombai evam madras prayek kii 15 shakhaayen thim
 The Presidency Banks Act, which came into force from 1 May 1876, brought three presidency banks under uniform law with uniform restrictions on business
 tathaapi, teen presidency nagaron main lok rin karyaalayon tathaa sarkaar kii jamaarashiyon ke ek bhaag kii abhiraksha kaa kaary bainkon ke paas hone ke baavjood sarkaar kaa malikana sambandh samaapt kar diya gaya
 The Act provided for the creation of three reserve funds in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras where deposits of more than the minimum amount prescribed for holding presidency banks in their head offices were maintained
 sarkaar in arakshit koshon se presidency bainkon ko rin de sakati thi parantu ye bank use adhikaar ke bajaay anugrah ke rup main dekhte the
 Growth of new branches after the year 1876 by the Government's decision to keep additional deposits in reserve funds outside the general control of the Presidency banks and the government's decision not to guarantee minimum deposits at new locations where branches were to be opened Was greatly interrupted

 Some of these cash crops began to be sent to foreign markets
 chaay tathaa coffee ke baganon ke kaaran povi tarai ke bade kshetra, assam evam nilgiri ke parvat utkrisht sthavar krishi kshetra ke rup main rupantarit ho gaye
 As a result of all this, India's international trade expanded sixfold
 teenon presidency bank up-mahadweep ke prayek vyapaar, vinirmaan evam utkhanan kii gatividhi ke vittaposhan main vyaavhaarik rup se sammilit ho jane ke kaaran ye bank vanijyikaran kii is prakriya ke labhathi evam pravartak donon rahe
 Banks in Bengal and Bombay were engaged in financing large modern manufacturing industries, while Bank of Madras started financing small scale industries like nowhere else
 parantu in teenon bainkon ko videshi mudra se jude kisi bhi vyavsaay se alag rakhaa gaya
 Such a business was considered a business risk for these banks holding government deposits, as well as the fear that these banks under government protection would create an unfair competition for exchange banks in India at that time
 varsh 1935 main bhartiya reserve bank kaa gathan hone tak in bainkon ko is vyavsaay se alag rakhaa gaya
 The Imperial Bank of India was formed by merging the Presidency Banks of Bengal, Bombay and Madras in the year 1921 with their 70 branches
 in teenon bainkon ko ek sanyukt sanstha ke rup main rupantarit kiya gaya tathaa bhartiya vanijyik bainkon ke bich ek vishaal bank kaa pradurbhaav hua
 This new bank accepted the triple role of commercial banks, bankers bank and government bank
 parantu is gathan ke peeche bhartiya state bank kii aavashyaktaa par varshon pehle kiya gaya vichaar-vimarsh shaamil tha
 In the end, a mixed organization emerged which carried out the functions of commercial banks and semi-central banks
 varsh 1935 main bharat ke kendriya bank ke rup main bhartiya reserve bank ke gathan ke saath imperial bank kii ardh-kendriya bank kii bhoomika samaapt ho gai
 Imperial Bank, instead of being a Government of India bank, became an agent of the Reserve Bank of India for the execution of government business in centers where there is no central bank
 parantu vah karency chest evam chote sikkon ke depo kaa tathaa bhartiya reserve bank dwaara nirdhaarit sharton par anya bainkon evam janata ke liye wipreshan suvidha yojana parichaalit karne kaa kaary nirantar karata rahaa
 He also started working as a banker by keeping the bankers' surplus cash with them and lending to them on authorized securities
 aise kai sthanon par bank samashodhan grihon kaa prabandhan bhi karata rahaa jahaan par bhartiya reserve bank ke karyaalay nahin the
 The bank was also the largest tenderer in the fiscal bill auctions conducted by the Reserve Bank on behalf of the government
 reserve bank kii sthapana ke baad imperial bank ko ek vanijyik bank ke rup main parivartit karne ke liye uske samvidhan main mahatvapurn sanshodhan kiye gaye
 The restrictions previously imposed on his business were lifted and for the first time the bank was allowed to conduct foreign exchange business and performer and trustee business
 imperial bank ne apane astitv ke baad se saadhe teen dashakon ke dauraan karyaalayon, arakshit nidhiyon, jamaarashiyon, niveshon evam agrimon ke rup main bahut hi prabhaavshaalee vruddhi darj kii
 In some cases this increase was more than six times

 The kind of confidence that depositors had with the proud tradition of banking the Imperial Bank regularly followed and the high level of integrity displayed in its operations was not possible for any Indian bank at that time
 
 in sabake kaaran imperial bank ne bhartiya banking udyog main ati vishisht sthiti praapt kii tathaa desh ke aarthik jivan main mahatvapurn sthaan bhi praapt kiya
 At the time of independence, Imperial Bank had a capital-base reserve of Rs

 When the First five-year Plan started in the year 1951, the development of rural areas of the country was given the highest priority in it
 us samay tak imperial bank of india sahit desh ke vanijyik bainkon kaa kaary-kshetra shahari kshetra tak hi simit tha tathaa ve gramin kshetron ke aarthik punarnirmaan kii bhavi aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar nahin the
 Therefore, to meet the overall economic situation of the country in general and the needs of the rural sector in particular, the All India Rural Credit Survey Committee acquired Imperial Bank of India and established a government-sponsored and government-sponsored bank in it
 Recommendations in which it was also proposed to integrate the erstwhile state-owned or state-owned banks tadnusaar may 1955 main sansad main ek adhinium paarit kiya gaya tathaa 1 july 1955 ko bhartiya state bank kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Thus more than a quarter of the resources of the Indian banking system came under the direct control of the government
 baad main, 1959 main bhartiya state bank adhinium paarit kiya gaya jiske falswarup bhartiya state bank ne purvavati rajyon ke aath sahyogi bainkon kaa anushanbee ke rup main adhigrahan kiya is prakaar bhartiya state bank kaa pradurbhaav saamaajik uddeshy ke nae daayitv ke saath hua
 The bank had a total of 480 offices, including branches, sub offices and three local head offices inherited from Imperial Bank

 ganit ke kshetra main nayi khojon kaa prakaashan bahut unchi dar par sacdo vaigyanik patrikao main jari he
 One of the most exciting developments of recent times is the validation of the last theorem of the firm by Andrew Wills, for 350 years the brilliant mathematicians have been trying to solve this problem
 ganit main kai prasiddh khuli samasyaayen hai, sankadon nahin to pichley kuch dashakon main to hai hi

 One of these problems was the proven Poincaré conjecture by the Russian mathematician Grigori Perelmann, released in a paper in 2003, reviewed by an equivalent group in 2006, and the evidence was accepted as valid
 ganitagya aamtaur par ganit ke pattern ke vivaran va khoj main or prameya ke pramaan dhundne main ruchi rakhte hai

 For example, it seems that number theory has no purpose in the real world, but the development of computers revealed its important application in algorithms and cryptography

 If a certain fact is verified by a mathematician, but it has not been proven or disproved, it is called an inference: a paradox in its paradox is called a fact theorem
 bhautik siddhanton ke badalane kii ummid kii ja sakati he jab kabhi is bhautik sansar ke bare main koi nai jaankaree praapt hoti he
 Mathematics changes in a different way: new ideas may not prove old ideas a lie, but they serve to broaden any previously known fact
 udhaaharan ke liye ek char kalan, bahu char kalan main vyapak ho jaataa he, jo vishleshan par bahu guneet ho jaataa he
 The development of algebraic geometry in its traditionally modern form is a good example of how the field of mathematics changes morally, but it does not prove that the previously verified fact is in any way incorrect
 haalanki ek prameya, jab ek baar siddh ho jaati he, hameshaa ke liye sach ban jaati he, prameya kaa vaastavik arth hamen gaharaai se tab samaj main aata he, jab prameya ke chaaron taraf kii ganit babbti he

 vah shaks, yah sab dekhakar dehshat main pad jaataa he or bhaag nikalataa he
 The story then turns to the newly emerging model, 20-year-old Nandita, who is in love with Yash, who is the director and host of a real serial "superstition", which makes films on various supernatural ghosts and superstitions like Tantric Vudu

 is baar yash janmdin ke maukey par nandita ko bataur tohafaa ek apartment detaa he, ve nai jindagi kii shuruyaat karte he or donon prem main lipt hote hai, kuch vakt baad nandita garbhvatee hoti he
 One evening, Nandita encounters a very aspiring artist named Prithvi who reaches him in search of his masterpiece
 prithvi use bataata he ki 4 maah pehle usne ek ladki kii scaching banaai thi, jo asal main nandita kii thi
 He also shows the painting in which his wrist is lying on the cut
 vah nandita se kisi bhi khatre ke prati chaukas rahane ko aagaah karata he
 But ignoring the matter of Prithvi, Nandita suddenly has a phantom cut her wrist in the bathroom
 prithvi use bachaata he or aspataal main bharti karaata he
 Yash rushes to the hospital and tries to find out her pregnancy and tells that her abortion is now difficult due to excessive bleeding
 vah yash se prithvi ke bare main shikaayat karti he, or yash use giraftaar karata he,magar jald hi vah vahaan se chhut jaataa he
 Meanwhile, at Kalindi, the American, David Cooper, who owns Kalindi's chemical factory, also writes himself with his own blood on the wall of his room before hanging himself, saying, "you are impure, Rotten from inside "
 vahiin is aatmahatya kii tahakiqaat kar rahaa inspector bhi iske buree prabhaav kii chapet main aata he
 Back in his house, Prithvi makes another picture in which a mob attacks Nandita
 vah us fishan sho main jaataa he jahaan nandita apana pradarshan karti he, or usapar jaise bhoot savaar hota he or sho main upasthit ek aadhyatmik guru par hamalaa kar baithti he
 She then repeats the same lines, telling him, "you are impure, rotten inside"
 prithvi use bachaane ko daudta he, magar vahaan maujuud guard dwaara roak liya jaataa he
 Nandita is kept away from the teacher and the audience
 kuch vakt baad tivi par guru ji kaa saakshaatkaar dikhaaya jaataa he, jo nandita par kisi pret ke haaavee hone kii baat kehete hai
 Knowing everything there, Yash publicly apologizes the most, and reveals that he is in fact troubled by mental problems
 udhar gards ke haathon prithvi ke chhootane baad, nandita ko phir se bathroom main vah pret dikhaai padataa he, jo dubaara vahi panktiyaan shishe main likh di jaati he
 She goes to ask for help from Earth, but he denies her, showing this picture in which she has hanged herself and the same lines are written near her
 phir vah us samachar kii cliping bhi dikhaata he jisamen us pujari or david kupar kii maut hui he,or unheen peeche vahi samaan panktiyaan likhi gai thi
 Nandita thanks her and reaches Yash's convening party to attend
 par vahaan pahunch kar bhi bhoot usape haaavee hota he or, khud ko hi ghayal karti he or khun bahane lagata he
 Meanwhile, the Earth is ready for his help by burning that wretched future picture of Nandita, to the point that he will save her life
 vah nandita ko party se bhaagate dekh letaa he, khun se tar, or phir vah uske peeche pad jaataa he
 Eventually he finds her in a slum area, where she was writing the same lines repeating
 prithvi use rokane kii koshish karata he magar vah jaan jaataa he ki nandita par pret haaavee he
 Nandita tries her best to be happy but the earth stops her from doing so
 yash tabhi bhaagta hua pahunchataa he or nandita ko prithvi kii banhon main paata he
 Yash would then agree to help Nandita but on condition that she leave the Earth, but she refuses to take his help and decides to walk with the Earth so that Kalindi can go and find this truth
 us shaam prithvi or nandita guest house main raat gujaarte hai or agali subah ravaanaa hote hai
 After a full day's journey, they reach Kalindi and meet the wife of the priest who tells that her husband had himself indulged in such misdeeds and that he would not be surprised at his death, this would probably be the reason for his death
 He may have committed the crime of playing with many innocent people in the name of religion
 phir to vah log us police inspector ke ghar jane kaa faisla lete he,, jahaan vah log pate hai ki puri tarah pagal ho chukaa he or naa hi is laayak ki use khudkhushi karne se roka jaae
 Nandita and Prithvi return the same evening, if there is no unexpected evidence
 raste main nandita aane vaale anjaamon ko or sah nahin paane ke kaaran vah prithvi se aatmahatya karne kii darkhaast karti he
 Prithvi assures him that they will find the truth together
 tabhi unki car ko kai saare maveshi bhainson kaa jhund roktaa he or ek bifaraya sand unki car ko takkar jadte hue palat detaa he
 Nandita gets out of the car, tries desperately to get out of the earth
 phir vahi pret use jangal kii ore le jaataa he jahaan usapar dubaara aasmaanya dhang se hamalaa he
 Then many people are seen hanging on the trees
 iske baad vah ek kuen ke yahaan paati he or dekhati he vahaan koi najadik khadaa he, vah uski ore badhati he
 In this, she jumps into the well, the earth also leaps and grabs her behind
 yah jaanate hue ki kuen kii diwaar ek sidhi khadi chattan kii tarah he
 Within the well, Nandita knows that it is the father of the earth, Veer Pratap Singh, who continues to dominate her
 yah sab tab shuru hua jab unhen kalindi ke rasinic kaarkaane se nikle jahrile kachare ko nadi main bahaae jane kii baat maaloom hui or jahaan har varsh hajaaron shraddhalu is pavitra anushthan main sarovar main snaan karne pahonchte hai
 They also go to the police station to file a complaint against David Cooper, but the same policemen and temple priests threaten not to take any action, otherwise they will risk their lives themselves by disrupting the sacred ritual
 iske pratyuttar main vah unako kahata he, "tum ashuddh ho, andar se sad chuke ho"
 Veer Pratap tries to reveal all this truth to everyone, but soon the priests' battered lathi beat him to death, but somehow he falls into the well in a round of saving lives
 marane ke baad vah ruh banakar apana badla lete hai
 In this way, he gets to know David Cooper, and the policemen and priests who accompany him
 prithvi aakhir main yah sachai jaan to letaa ho, magar vah samaj nahin paata is maamle main nandita isamen kyun ulajh rahi he
 Here, Yash reaches Nandita with her Lashkar in the morning
 usee shaam prithvi ko nandita kaa ek or daraavna sapana dikhaai detaa he, vah fouran farsh par uski tasviir banaata he jahaan is baat kii soochna thi ki aaj uski hatya honi he
 At the same time, it becomes known that Yash's death of Veer Pratap Singh is all evidence, but he gave that evidence to David only for the purpose of his show
 nandita us saboot ko dhundne ke liye bhaagane kii koshish karti he magar isse pehle yash usapar goli chalaa hi detaa, prithvi vahaan pahunch kar nandita ko bachaa letaa he
 But the dice turns, yash cleverly injures the earth
 ant main, vir pratap kii aatma prakat hokar yash ko uske kiye kaa dand miltaa he or maaraa jaataa he
 With this, the wounds of the earth heal as soon as Veer Pratap passes away
 vahiin tamaam hatyaon ke sabooton tathaa kalindi ke sarovar kii vifailli hone kii pramanikta par anushthan sambandhi parv ke saath us rasinic kaarkaane ko bhi band kar diya jaataa he

 kapil ne kya upadesh diya, is par vivaad or shodh hota rahaa he
 The Tattvasamasutra is believed to be composed by his commentator Kapil
 sutara chote or saral hai
 That is why Maxmüller described him as very ancient
 8veen shatabdi ke jain granth 'bhagavadjjukium' main sankhya kaa ullekh karte hue kaha gaya he– a similar text is found in the 'tattvasamasutra'
 saath hi tatvasamasasutra ke tikaakar bhavaganesh kehete hai ki unhone tikaa likhte samay panchasikh likhit tikaa se sahaayta lee he
 According to Richard Garvey, the period of the fifth century should be of the first century
 at: bhagavajjukium tathaa bhavaganesh kii tikaa ko yadi pramaan maane to 'tatvasamasasutra' kaa kaal isa kii pehali shatabdi tak le jaaya ja saktaa he
 Prior to this, there is lack of strong evidence for its condition
 sankhyapravachansutra ko bhi kuch tikaakar kapil kii kriti maanate hai
 Kaapudiprabha's Karta Swapneshwar considers the 'sankhyaprakshutra' to be the work of the Panchashikha and says that this book was created by Kapil because it is believed that Kapil is the originator of Sankhya
 yahi baat 'tatvasamaas' ke bare main bhi kahi ja sakati he
 But the description of Sankhyakrakshutra is not in Madhava's 'sarvadarsanasangraha' and neither in Gunaratna itself has given a description of Sankhya
 at: vidvan log ise 14veen shatabdi kaa granth maanate hai
 But by mentioning them in the Gita, they seem more ancient
 inke samay or janmasthan ke bare main nishchay nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Many scholars are skeptical about their historicity
 puraanon tathaa mahabharat main inkaa ullekh hua he
 It is said that Kapil is born in the beginning of every cycle
 janm ke saath hi sari siddhiyaan inako praapt hoti hai
 That is why they are called Adisiddhas and Adividavans
 inkaa shishy koi asuri naamak vansh main utpann varshasahasrayaji shrotriy brahman batalaaya gaya he
 According to the tradition, the said Asuri was preached in Nirmanikatta and he preached philosophy
 nirmaanchitt kaa arth hota he siddhi ke dwaara apane chitt ko swechha se nirmit kar lenaa
 It is known from this, Kapil did not preach in front of Asuri in an interview, but in the knowledge of Asuri, his propounded principles were recollected, hence he is called the Guru of 'asuri'
 mahabharat main ye sankhya ke vaktaa kahe gaye hai
 He is also said to be the incarnation of Agni and the Manasaputra of Brahma
 shrimadbhagavat ke anusaar kapil vishnu ke pancham avatar maane gaye hai
 Their origin is believed to be from Kardam and Devahuti
 baad main inhone apni mata devhooti ko sankhyagyaan kaa upadesh diya jiskaa vishad varnan shrimadbhagavat ke tisare skandh main miltaa he
 Kapilvastu, where the Buddha was born, was a city named after Kapil and the son of Sagara saw Kapil on the banks of the ocean and found his curse and later there the Ganges confluence with the ocean
 isse maaloom hota he ki kapil kaa janmasthan sambhavat: kapilwastu or tapasyakshetra gangasagar tha
 From this, it is possible to say at least that Kapila's name had spread before the Buddha
 yadi ham kapil ke shishy asuri kaa shatapath brahman ke asuri se abhinn maane to kah sakate hai ki kam-se-kam brahmankaal main kapil kii sthiti rahi hogi
 Thus, 700 years BC The period of Kapil can be considered
 sankhyashastra kaa uddeshy tatvagyan ke dwaara moksh praapt karnaa he
 In the Brahmin texts, the attainment of the exclusion through Yajna Karma has been described
 karmkand ke vipareet gyaancand ko mahatv dena sankhya kii sabase badi visheshta he
 In the Upanishads, knowledge is considered superior to karma
 yadhyapi adhikansh upanishdon main brahm ko charam satta or sansar ko usee kaa parinaam yaa vivart batalaaya gaya he; tathaapi kuch upanishdon main, mukhya rup se main sankhya ke siddhanton kaa pratipaadan miltaa he
 But this rendering is not in order, it only points to some theories that were later incorporated into the Samkhya theory
 kapil ko adisiddh athwa siddhesh kehane kaa arth yah he ki sambhavat: kapil ne hi sarvapratham dhyaan or tapasya kaa maarg batalaaya tha
 His first karma was a path and knowledge was limited to discussion only
 gyaan ko sadhana kaa rup dekar kapil ne tyaag, tapasya evam samadhi ko bhartiya samskruti main pehali baar pratishthit kiya
 Prakriti and Purush are the two elements considered in Sankhya
 prakruti ko satv, rajas or tamas in teen gunon se nirmit kaha gaya he
 Triguna is created by its equilibrium, nature and its contrast
 sristi main kuch nayaa nahin he, sab prakruti se hi utpann he
 The world is just the result of nature
 satkaryawad or parinamwad ke pravartak ke rup main sankhya kii prasiddhi he
 The creation of a person is contrasted with nature with the mere affection of man
 prakruti jad he-purush chetan, prakruti karta he-purush niskriy
 Like the combination of the long and the blind, there is the combination of man and nature
 purush chetan he or apana bimb prakruti main dekhakar apane ko hi karta samajhataa he or isi agyaan ke bandhan main padakar du:kha bhogata he, moh ko praapt hota he
 The moment a man comes to know that he is not a doer, a disinterested, a passive witness, the drama of nature ends for him
 agyaanjanya karmbandh se mukt hokar apane keval rup ko jaan lenaa kaivalya yaa moksh he or yahi param purusharth he
 When liberated, nature is unimportant for the free man, but for other worldly man it is true because nature is not destroyed
 yahi kaaran he ki sankhya main naanaa purush maane gaye hai
 According to the Puranas and 'sankhyaprakshutras', a Purushottama is also considered above men
 yah purushottam yaa ishwar purush ko moksh detaa he
 But according to the oldest available Sankhya treatise 'sankhyakarika', God has no place in Sankhya
 spashtat: kapil bhi nirishvaravaadi the, seshwar sankhya kaa vikaas baad main hua
 Twenty-five elements are considered in Sankhya
 purush, purush kii sannidhiyukt prakruti se mahat yaa buddhi, buddhi se ahankaar, ahankaar se paanch tanmatraayen athwa sookshm bhoot or man, paanch tanmatraaon se paanch gyanendriyaan, paanch karmedriyaan or paanch sthoolbhoot utpann hote hai
 Nature does not originate from any of these, important ego and system, they originate from seven nature and also generate other elements
 baaki solah tatv keval utpann hai, kisi nae tatv ko janm nahin dete
 Therefore, they are considered to be sixteen vices, nature is invariable, importance etc
 The seven elements themselves are vicious and also cause disorder

 For cooling coils, the most common are cold water and refrigerators
 Cold water is supplied from a coolant that may be located far away, but the refrigerant must come from the nearest condensing unit
 jab prasheetak kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, vaashp-sampeden prashithan chakra main shitalan coil vashpak he
 HVAC coils that use this direct-expansion of refrigerants are commonly called DX coils
 HVAC coylon ke vaayu kii ore, taapan or prashithan ke liye prayukt ke bich ek mahatvapurn antar maujuud rahata he
 Because of manometry, moisture is condensed out of the air that is cooled, except in extremely dry airflow
 The heating of some air increases the ability of that air to hold water

 Heat exchangers, not typical in direct-combustion furnaces present in many homes, are 'coils'
 bajaay iske ve gas se hawa taap vinimayak hai, jo aam taur par kate steel shit dhaatu ke bane hote hai
 Combustion products pass through one side of these heat exchangers and air to be conditioned from the other side
 Therefore, a cracked heat exchanger is a dangerous situation that needs immediate attention, as it allows combustion products to enter the building

 SHE is often used in the heating of liquids that include solids and thus have a tendency to block the interior of the heat exchanger
 nune daab giravat SHE ko aasaani se avaruddhata ko sanbhaalane kii kshamta detii he
 The SHE uses an "auto-cleaning" mechanism, under which the blocked surfaces locally increase fluid velocity, thereby increasing the dredging on the blocked surface, thus helping to remove the resistor and keep the heat exchanger clean 
 "taap antaran kii sataha banane vaali aantarik diwaar aksar moti hoti he, jo SHE ko kaafii majboot banaati he or pratikul pariveshon main lambey samay tak tiki rahati hai
 "they can be cleaned easily by opening them like a furnace, where any deposits deposited can be removed by pressure washing
