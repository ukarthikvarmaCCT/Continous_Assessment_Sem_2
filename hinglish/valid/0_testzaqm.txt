 Montessori education is an educational approach developed by Italian physician and teacher Maria Montessori
 yah vidhi bachche ke prakritik, manovaigyanik, shaareerik or saamaajik vikaas ke saath unke sangruhit swatantraa par vishesh dhyaan detaa he
 Although many practices exist under the series named "montessori", the Association Montessori International and the American Montessori Society cite these elements as essential: shoshak buddhi: Sensitive Period: samanyikaran: Montessori education is fundamentally a model of human development and an educational approach based on that model
 The model has two basic principles
 pehla, bachche or vikasshil vyasak apane parivesh ke saath baatcheet ke madhyam se manovaigyanik aatm - nirmaan main sanlagn hote hai
 Second, children of K, especially under the age of six years, have a comfortable path of mental development
 apane tippaniyon ke aadhaar par montesri kaa maananaa tha ki bachche ishtatam vikaas ke liye anayas kaary karenge jab vah swatantra se unke banaae hue model kaa chayan karte hai or ek vaataavaran main swatantra rup se kaary karte hai
 Montessori saw the universal innate features in human psychology that his son and colleague Mario Montessori identified in 1957 as a "human tendency"
 There is some debate about the exact list but mainly the following are clearly identified: montesri drushtikon me, ye maanav kii pravriti ke vikaas ke har charan main mukhya rup se dikhaai dete hai or shiksha se hamen inkaa jawaab milanaa chahie
 Montessori's educational method encourages free activity within a "ready" environment, meaning an educational environment based on basic human characteristics, for specific characteristics of children at different ages, and for each child's own personality 
 paryaavaran kaa yah kaam he ki vah bachche ko apane yaa uske bheetar manovaigyanik nirdeshon ke anusaar sabhi kshetron main swatantraaa ko viksit karne kii anumati de
 In addition to offering Montessori material use to children of appropriate age, the environment must demonstrate the following characteristics: kaharuva yaa trinmani vriksh kii aisi gond ko kehete hai jo samay ke saath sakht hokar pathar ban gai ho

 After this Sir Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the "inverse square law of gravity"
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The value of the force f acting between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravitational constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 maan lijie prithvi kii sanhati m he or iske dharaatal par m sanhati vaala koi pind padaa hua he
 If the Earth's body is to be condensed at its center and the radius of the Earth is r, then the attraction force acting by the body on that body: newton ke dwitiya gatinium ke anusaar kisi pind par laganevaala bal us pind kii sanhati tathaa twaran ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 Thus, the force of gravity acting on a body falling freely under the influence of the attraction of the Earth: jahaan g us pind kaa gurutvajanit twaran he, at: That is, g = the force acting on the unit code of the body
 kintu sameekaran se Hence gravitational acceleration g is also often called the intensity of gravity of 'earth'
 newton dwaara gurutvkarshan ke niyam kaa pratipaadan hone ke baad hi gurutv niyatank g kaa maan gyaat karne kii samasya ne vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan apni ore aakrisht kiya
 The reason for this was that it is one of the basic determinants of nature and is completely different from country, time and situation
 isliye ise saarvatrik niyatank kehete hai
 Also, it can also be related to the Code of the Earth
 at: prithvi kii sanhati evam ghanatv gyaat karne ke liye bhi iske maan ke gyaan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This will be clear from the following deliberation: sameekaran or main tulana karne par But the amount of earth jahaan d prithvi kaa madhya ghanatv he
 g = g p r3 d / r2 = g pr d arthath G
 D
 = 3 g / It is clear from this formula that to find the value of one of the g or D, the value of the other must be known
 atev prithvi kaa ghanatv gyaat karne se purv g kaa thik maan gyaat kar sakane kii vidhiyon kii ore vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakrisht hona swaabhaavik hi tha
 We can divide the scientific efforts made to find the value of gravity constant in three categories: is vidhi kaa avlamban karanevaalon main bugar nevil meskeline airi tathaa phon sternek ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Its principle is summarized as follows: maan lijie m sanhati kaa koi pind prithvi dwaara aakarshith ho rahaa he
 It is obvious that this attraction force will be equal to the weight w of that body
 ab yadi us pind par ek parshvik bal bhi, kisi anya brihatkaay prakritik pind dwaara lag rahaa ho to newton ke niyamanusaar parshvik bal f = f m m ' / d2 xxrep 8 


 
 yahan m’ us brihatkaay prakritik pind kii sanhati tathaa d uske tathaa chote pind ke bich kii duuri he
 If the radius of the Earth is r w = g μ r3 Dm / r2 = mμ r xxrep 11 
 On comparing equations and w / f = r d2 d / m’ meaning d = 3m’ / 4p r d2 d 
 xxrep 17 
 is sameekaran main g nahin aata
 Therefore, if other quantities are known, the mean density d of the earth will be known
 w / f kaa maan alag kai prayogon dwaara gyaat kar liya jaataa he
 Again in place of m in the equation, mg / g ie rakhane par is sameekaran se g kaa maan gyaat ho jaayga
 In 1740 AD, Booger conducted two types of experiments and tried to find the length of the second pendulum and the value of g at different heights
 ek sthaan to dakshini america ke piru naamak desh main quito naamak pathaar par chunaa
 For the difference in the altitudes of these two places, he revised the value of g obtained at sea level: for this he assumed that there was only air in between the two heights
 is prakaar gananaa dwaara pathaar ke liye praapt g ke maan or prayog dwaara praapt maan main 1 / 6983 gune kaa antar paaya
 Booger concluded that this difference was due to the attraction of the Bhupadartha contained in the 9400 feet high plateau
 is prayog ne yah sanket diya ki sampurna prithvi kaa aakarshan us pathaar ke aakarshan kaa 6983 guna he
 By calculating the attraction of the plateau, Booger estimated that the density of the Earth is 4
7 times the density of the plateau

 It can be understood as: Suppose the density of ghosts from the center of the earth to the bottom of the mine is d and from there to the top of the mine, the density of ghosts is d

 The goal was to find the value of gravity by finding the increase in the weight of the smaller body by bringing any other heavy body under it
 iskaa siddhant is prakaar he : Suppose a body of m samhita is hung by a wire from one arm of a very sensitive balance
 yadi prithvi kii sanhati m tathaa ardhavyas r ho to us pind par kaary karne vaala gurutvkarshan bal w = GM m / r2 xxrep 12

 The value of g can also be determined by another method

 a special type of mirror was used in this arrangement which increased the bending of the pedicle by 150 times
 yah pehle hi alag prayogon ke dwaara gyaat kar liya gaya tha ki tandi kitne bhaar ke liye kitni jhukati he
 From this, it was calculated by how much force the bending in the pedicle was caused by mutual attraction between the two spheres

 If the quantities of the small and large bodies are m and m respectively and for the unit deflection, the force of the spasm of the wire is, then in the equilibrium state, the gravitational force of the wire is the spasm of the wire spasm

 Classical information regarding plays is called Natya Shastra
 is jaankaree kaa sabase purana granth bhi naatyashaastra ke naam se janaa jaataa he jiske rachayita bharat muni the
 The lifetime of Bharata Muni is believed to be sometime between 400 BC to 100 AD
 sangeet, naatak or abhinay ke sampurna granth ke rup main bharatmuni ke natya shaastra kaa aaj bhi bahut sammaan he
 He believes that the rules of theatrical composition are not only assessed in the Natya Shastra, but the actor theater and observers interpret the means to fulfill these three elements
 37 adhyyon main bharatmuni ne rangamanch abhinayta abhinay nritygitvaadya, darshak, dasharupak or ras nishpatti se sambandhit sabhi tathyon kaa vivechan kiya he
 It is clear from Bharata's study of the Natya Shastra that the success of the play is not based solely on the talent of the writer but also with the cooperation of various arts and artists
 natya or nritt, drishy kavy ke ye do bhed hai
 Anatruti Natya of a particular state by nati-nati is - 'natyate Abhinataveen Rupayate- Iti Natyam'
 taal or lay kii sangati se anubaddh anukrit ko nritt kehete hai
 Both of these are subjects of acting and are considered under the fine arts
 natya ke pramukh ang chaar hai - vaachik, satvik, angik or aharya
 The exact replication of utterances is a matter of oral performance
 bhaavon kaa yathavat pradarshan satvik abhinay he
 For the performance of the hands, feet, eyes, bruises, and various gestures of the limb, mouth, head, etc
, there is an imitative act
 deshavidesh ke anuroop veshbhusha, chaaldhaal, rahan sahan or boli kii anukriti aharya abhinay kaa vishay he
 The research of dance, song, instrument and tempo, instinct, tendency and posture, which is instrumental to the performance of the quadrant, is also under the play
 is prakaar abhinay ke vividh ang evam upangon ke swaroop or prayog ke akaarprakaar kaa vivaran prastut kar tatsambandhi niyam tathaa vyavhaar ko nirdhaarit karanevaala shaastra 'naatyashaastra' he
 According to the place of acting, the place is called Natyagriha, as such, the construction and rendering of the rules of decoration is also the subject of Natyashastra
 vividh shrenee ke abhinayta evam abhinetri ke vyavhaar, paraspar sanlap or abhinay ke nirdesan evam nirdeshak ke kartavyon kaa vivaran bhi naatyashaastra kii vyapak paridhi main samavisht he
 Its main purpose is to entertain the hardworking masses from the many afflictions of the physical life - it is a simple means of fun for the Gods, demons and human society

 Its promoter is Prajapati himself, who gave birth to the text of the Rigveda, songs from the Samaveda, acting from the Yajurveda and accession of Rasa from the Atharvangiras
 uma-mahadev ne suprit ho lokanuranjan ke hetu lasya evam tandav kaa sahyog dekar ise upakrit kiya he
 In fact, there is no such scripture, no craft, no education nor any art which is not represented in Natyashastra
 is tarah anupam divyata se anupranit naatyashaastra ke adhishthata dev kii bhi kalpana, itar veda evam vedangon ke adhishthaataaon kii bhanti, kii gai he jiske swaroop kaa ullekh 'nrisinghprasaad' naamak granth main miltaa he
 The name of the rules of theatrical rules is 'natyashastra'
 bhartiya parampara ke anusaar naatyashaastra ke aadya rachayita swayan prajapati maane gaye hai or use 'natyaved' kahkar natyakala ko vishisht sammaan pradaan kiya gaya he
 Just as the seer of the Vedrashi, born of the supreme man's self-assurance, is considered diverse sage, in the same way, the seer of the Natya Veda propounded by Mahadev is considered Shilali, Krishna and Bharatamuni
 shilaali evam krishashv dwaara sankalit natyasanhitaayein aaj uplabdh nahin he, keval bharat muni dwaara pranit granth hi uplabdh hua he jo 'naatyashaastra' ke naam se prathit he
 It was probably originated in the country of Kashmir
 naatyashaastra kaa rachanakaal, nirmanstyli tathaa bahisakshya ke aadhaar par isa purv duusari shatabdi ke lagbhag sthir kiya ja saktaa he
 In this book, there is the impression of Pratibhagya philosophy
 pratybhigna darshan main sweekrut 36 mul tatwon ke pratik swaroop naatyashaastra main 36 adhyay hai
 In the first chapter, after giving the Natyottapati, in the second, after the Mandapavidhan, the procedure of the process before the Natyarambha is described in the next three chapters
 chathe or saatven adhyay main rason or bhaavon kaa vyaakhyaan he, jo bhartiya kavyashastra main vyaapt rassiddhanth kii aadharshila he

 In the 18th and 19th chapters, the 20th Vritti is discussed by giving a description of the distinction of the Natya and the Kalevar

 Apart from this, the original text is also published from the Chaukhamba Sanskrit Series, Varanasi, whose text is different from the text of Decision
 abhinav bharti tikaa sahit naatyashaastra kaa sanskaran gayakwad series ke antargat baroda se prakashit he
 In fact, this book is the fundamental code of theatrical constitution and Rasasiddhanta
 isaki manyata itani adhik he ki iske vaakya 'bharatsutra' kahe jate hai
 For centuries, it has received great respect
 is granth main mulat: 12,000 padya tathaa kuch gadyansh bhi tha, isi kaaran ise 'dwadashasahasri samhita' kaha jaataa he
 But in chronological order, its short version became prevalent, whose dimension was six thousand verses and this short code was called 'satsahsri'
 bharatmuni ubhay samhita ke praneta maane jate hai or pracheen tikaakaron dwaara unka 'dwadash sahasricar' tathaa 'shatsahasricar' kii oopaadhi se paraamarsh yatra tatra kiya gaya he
 Just as the basis of Chanakya policy available today, the basis of old Chanakya and memories are considered to be old Vashishtha, old Manu, respectively, in the same way there is mention of Vriddhi Bharat
 iskaa yah taatpary nahin ki vasishtha, manu, chanakya, bharat aadi do do vyakti ho gaye, parantu is sandarbh main 'vruddh' kaa taatpary paripurna samhitakaar se he
 Numerous interpretations were written on the Natyashastra and the lecturers of the Bharatasutras were considered to be the founding masters of their own doctrine, whose views became popular in the form of various poetic debates
 aise aacharyon main ullekhneey naatyashaastra ke vyaakhyaata hai- ritivaadee bhatta udbhat, pushtivaadee bhatta lollat, anumitivaadee shankuk, muktivaadee bhatta nayak or abhivyaktivaadee abhinav gupt
 Apart from these, Nakhkut, Matrugupta, Rahulak, Kirtidhar, Thakaligarbha, Harshadeva and Shripadashishya also presented their interpretations on the Natyashastra
 inamen se 'shripadashishyakrut' 'bharattilak' naam kii tikaa sarvapracheen prathit hoti he
 Sangeetadhyaya's lecturers in the Natyasastra have become numerous
 jinamein pramukh bhatta sumnas, bhattavriddhi, bhattayantra or bhatta gopal hai
 Apart from these, the musicically independent texts based on Bharatamuni's main disciples Matang, Dattil and Kohl's Natyashastra, Sadashiva and Randikeshwar have composed on dance and Bhatt Taut Prabhriti has written on Rasamimamsa
 bharat naatyashaastra kaa ras bhavadhyay bhartiya manovigyaan kaa aadhaar granth mana jaataa he
 The unification of the crowns i
e
 Union of the Crowns was the unification of King James 6 of Scotland on 24 March 1603 AD, ascending the English throne and the empire of Ireland, and as a result the global diplomacy and relations of the three countries under one emperor
 mukuton kaa ekikaran tuder rajgaraane se sambadhit england kii antim rani elizabeth pratham kii mrityu ke baad hua tha jo james kii avivaahit va vanshaheen buaa thim
 This unification remained a personal or hereditary unification, despite James's tireless efforts to create a unified mass Britain as the throne of Scotland remained separate from Britain
 haalanki usapar shashan james kaa hi tha
 According to this, Scotland and England remained separate countries while the ruler of those three countries remained the same with Ireland

 The poet William Dunbar has described the importance of this treaty in his poem The Thrilles and the Rois
 is sandhi ko sadiyon puraani anglon-scottish vaimnasyata ko khatm karne ke prayaason ke tahat kiya gaya tha
 This marriage tied the Stuarts to a relationship with the heirs of the Tudor royalty of England and gave a new lineage to British power
 us vakt kisi scottish rajkumaar kaa england kii satta par uttaradhikaar paanaa behad mushkil va aswabhaavik tha
 All the British feudal and courtiers were not happy with this treaty and were worried about its consequences in future
 ve nahin chaahate the ki england ke singhaasana par koi scot baithe
 However, this treaty could not last forever and it was only in 1513 that Henry 8 of England, along with the King of Ireland, attacked France

 Margaret Tudor's descendants were evicted from power in England

 During the reign of Elizabeth I, relations between the Scots and the British were extremely poor when Queen Mary 1 of the Scots challenged Elizabeth I's succession
 chunki elizabeth henry 8 kii pratham patni kii santan nahin thi isliye bahut se log unhen england kaa jaij shaasha nahin maanate the
 Elizabeth was sentenced to death by Elizabeth on charges of conspiring against her

 As a result James 6 of Scotland came to occupy both the dynasties and brought the two kingdoms under the same dynasty, proposing the integration of the two
