 The india-china war, also known as the india-china border dispute, was a war between China and India in 1962
 vivaadit himalay seemaa yuddh ke liye ek mukhya bahaanaa tha, lekin anya muddon ne bhi bhoomika nibhaai
 After the 1959 Tibetan rebellion in China, when India gave shelter to the Dalai Lama, a series of violent incidents started on the indo-china border

 On 20 October 1962, the Chinese Army launched simultaneous attacks in Ladakh and across the mcmahon Line

 China declared a cease-fire on 20 November 1962, as well as its withdrawal from one of the disputed two territories, the Indian posts and patrols were removed from Halakin Aksai Chin, direct after the end of the conflict The Chinese went under control

 In this war, most of the battles were fought at a height of more than 4250 meters

 The Navy or the Air Force were not used by both the Chinese and Indian side in this war

 According to military doctrine, an attacker usually needs a numerical superiority of 3: 1 ratio of foot soldiers to succeed

 According to China's official military history, this war helped China achieve its policy goals of protecting its western sector border, as China retained de facto control of Aksai Chin

 According to James Calvin, even though China won a military victory, it lost its international image

 These countries saw China's goals as world conquest and clearly believed that China was the aggressor in the border war

 After the war, the Indian Army underwent extensive changes and felt the need to be prepared for similar conflicts in the future

 a huge wave of patriotism began to arise among the Indians and many memorials were built for the Indian soldiers who were martyred in the war
 yakeenan, mukhya sabak jo bharat ne yuddh se siikhaa tha vah he apane hi desh ko majboot banane kii jarurat or china ke saath nehru kii "bhaichaare" vaali videsh niti se ek badlaav kii
 Due to the inability to anticipate the possibility of Chinese invasion of India, Prime Minister Nehru faced harsh criticism from government officials for promoting pacifist relations with China
 bhartiya raashtrapati radhakrishnan ne kaha ki nehru kii sarkaar aprishkrut or taiyaari ke bare main laaparvaah thi

 The Indian Army was divided due to Krishna Menon's policies of "good appointment to the favored" and the 1962 war was seen by the Indians as a combination of a military defeat and a political disaster

 The CIA later stated that at the time neither Chinese troops had sufficient fuel in Tibet nor a long runway that the Air Force was unable to use effectively

 Many Indians saw the war as a betrayal in India's attempt to establish a long-standing peace with China
 nehru dwaara "hindi-chini bhai, bhai" shabd ke upyog par bhi sawaal shuru ho gaye
 The war put an end to Nehru's hopes that India and China could form a strong Asian pole, a response to the growing influence of the superpowers of the Cold War group

 This war cemented India's policy of supplying arms through indigenous sources and self-sufficiency

 However, India formed the henderson-brooks-bhagat report for reasons of India's incomplete preparations for the war

 Some sources argue that as India occupied more territory than Pakistan, India had clearly won
 lekin, dusron kaa tark tha ki bharat ko mahatvapurn nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha or isliye, yuddh kaa parinaam anirnaayak tha
 Two years later, in 1967, there was a small border skirmish between Chinese and Indian troops as a Chola incident

 To know the reasons for the defeat, the Government of India took it immediately after the war

 kisi bhi bhukhand main vicharan karne vaale pashu-pakshi or jeev-jantuon kii upasthiti se vahaan kii jalwaayu kaa anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, on the basis of the presence of animals, birds and animals found in Braj, we can make an overall presentation of the Braj plot
 braj main do prakaar ke pashu-pakshi paye jate hai - 1
 junglee or 2
 paaltu
 Wild animals and animals and birds freely roam in the forests and forests, some of whom have been suffering from time to time in various forms and continue to suffer even today
 kintu paaltu pashu-pakshi sadaiv se maanav jati ke upyog main aate rahen hai or ve manushyajati ko sukh, suvidha or samruddhi pradaan karte rahe hai
 Both types of meat diet and Niramish Bhoji have been found in the wild animals of Braj
 maansaahaari pashuon main singh, baghersh, bhediya, lomadee, bhaaluu, reecha, syar aadi hai
 In a state of anger the pig also becomes carnivorous
 singh, baghersh, suar aadi maansaahaari hone ke saath-saath hinsak bhi hai
 As soon as they get an opportunity, they ambush humans and animals, but due to the lack of forests in the present time, these violent animals have also become depleted in Braj
 braj sahitya main hinsak pashuon ke utpaat kaa vishad varnan miltaa he
 Parmanand mentions cows and calves being bitten by tigers and calves by wolves
 1 ek vaartanusaar kumbhandas kaa putr krishnadas shrinath ji kii gaayon kii rakhwali karata tha
 One day when the cows were returning from the forest to graze, one of the cows was left behind by the herd
 us par ek singh ne achaanak akraman kar diya
 When Krishnadas reached to save the cow, the cow managed to reach his khirak by leaping, but Krishnadas was killed by Singh
 2 The residents of Braj always considered killing violent animals as a sin, but the king-maharaja and Muslim rulers used to hunt violent animals in the forests of Braj
 mughal samraaton main babar se lekar jahangir tak ne braj ke wanon main shikaar kiya tha iske ullekh us kaal kii tavaarikh main ullikhit hai
 Among wild animals, deer, nilgai, wild cow and monkey etc
 are notable
 ve maanvon par ghaatak akraman to nahin karte, kintu kheton or baag-bagichon ko bahut haani pahunchaate rahe hai
 When even violent animals are not killed in Braj, the wild in ahimsak pashuon kaa to maarane kaa prashn hi nahin banataa he
 Herds of deer, nilgai, wild cows etc
 have been transporting the crops of Braj farmers by wandering in the forests of Braj and the Khadirs of Yamuna
 nilgai or mrug kaa angrez adhikari or sipaahi shikaar karte the
 In fact, the blue cow is also an animal of the antelope
 bandar braj ke van-upavan or bastiyon main bahutayat main paye jate hai
 They have been extensively damaging the fruits of the forest groves and have also created many types of disturbance in human settlements
 phir bhi braj praja ne unhen ksht dene kii baat tak nahin sochi he
 Monkeys are guarded and served in Braj, they are considered to be the symbol of Hanuman
 nagarpalika ke dwaara bandaron ko pakadakar jangal main chhodane par braj praja ne is krity kaa virodh kiya tha
 The names of cow, horse, bull, buffalo, goat, sheep, donkey, dog, camel, elephant, etc
 can be named in the pet animals of Braj
 unakon paaltu banaakar maanav samaaj ne apni sukh samruddhi kaa kaaran bana liya he
 All these domesticated animals are employed in Braj, but cow always has special importance in Braj
 braj ke janajivan main gaay kaa jaisaa sthaan he, vaisaa kisi anya paaltu pashu kaa nahin he
 The cow is not just a useful animal, but in a way the mainstay of Braj culture
 bhagwaan shri krishna gaayon kii seva karne ke kaaran hi gopal or govind kahe jate hai
 The unique distinction given to this animal in Braj is due to its excessive use
 braj main bahut badi sankhya main sadiyon se gaayon ko paala jaataa rahaa he
 In the time of Lord Krishna, Giriraj hill was the center of major Gaucharan
 isiilie is govardhan kaa virud praapt ho sakaa he
 The entire life of Brajwala Gopas was based on cow dynasty
 ve isse doodh, dahi, makkhan jaise paushtik padaarthon ke praapt karte the uske gobar or mutr se jo khaad nirmit karte the, vah unke khet kii upaj ke badhaane main upyogi hota tha
 The calves produced from the cow were plows and plows, they carried goods
 is prakaar gaay brajvaasiyon ke jivan kaa aavashyak ang hi nahin, unke parivaar kaa pramukh sadsy hi ban gai thi
 If light is presented on the survival of the cow from prehistoric times, there has been unthinkable evidence of India's oldest Harappan civilization in the form of dead idols from urban and metropolitan places
 saindh nivasee kubad vaale saand kii puja karte the or belon ke dwaara baiylgaadee jotate the
 The cow was of great importance in the life of the vedic Aryans, the founders of the Aryan culture of India
 arya samskruti kaa 'charvaaha' samskruti ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, kyonki arya log jangalon main gochaaran karte the tathaa gaayon ke saath jangalon main hi nivas karte the
 For the land where there were good grazers, there were often conflicts among the Aryan tribes, there were wars to get more and more cows
 vaidic kaal main aarthik haisiyat kaa nirdhaaran gaayon kii sankhya se lagaaya jaataa tha adhik gaayen, jis kabeeley ke paas hoti thi vah utana hi sampatti shaali mana jaataa tha
 In the post-vedic period, the use of cow was understood by humans
 bachade ko janm denevaali gaay ko poojya mana jaataa tha kyonki bachhda bada hokar bail banakar bhoomi ko jotane ke kaam main aata tha
 There was no shortage of land at that time, the population was small and the amount of land was high but most of the land was covered by dense forests
 uttar vaidic kaal main lohe ke istamaal se jangalon ko kaata gaya or us bhoomi ko lohe ke phal lage hal se belon ke madhyam se jota gaya tathaa krishi upyogi banaaya gaya
 Shatpath Brahmin and Panchvish Brahmin texts describe that twenty bulls used to pull the same plow
 vaidic kaal main prithvi ke dohan ke liye adhikadhik purushon or belon kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kii gai
 Hence, a woman who gives birth to more and more calves and a cow who gives birth to more and more calves, was declared revered and the killing of the cow was banned from power
 chhathvin shatabdi i0 pus0 main jain or buddha dharm ke sansthaapakon ne gauhatya ko purnat: band kara diya tathaa jeevahatya ko dharm viruddh ghoshit qaraar diya or gaay ko or uske vansh ko purnat: sarakshan dete hue manushya jivan ke liye upyogi bataaya jisase gaay ke prati bhartiya janamaanash main shraddha sanchaar kaa srijan ho sakaa
 This unique utility of the cow has not given it a place in religion
 puranic anushruti ke anusaar yah samast bhumandal hi gaay ke sing par tikaa hua he
 Its wise meaning is that a lot of worldly life is based on the cow
 hamaari bhartiya samskruti kii yah visheshta he, ki jo niyam or bate maanav-jivan ke liye hitkar gyaat hui, unhen dharmik rup pradaan kar sangrakshit kar diya gaya
 This has added a sense of reverence and devotion to him
 braj ke jan jivan main gaay kaa jo mahatvapurn sthaan rahaa he, uske kaaran vah yahan kii dharmik bhaavana main se atyant nikat kaa sambandh rakhti he
 The charitable and devout people of Braj have expressed their devotion towards cow in very poignant terms
 saadhaaran musalamaanon main bhale hi gaay ke prati aisa drushtikon na rahaa ho, kintu jin sahruday musalamaanon ne braj kii bhakthi-bhaavana ko sweekaar kar liya tha, ve gaay ke prati hinduon se kam shraddhawan nahin the
 Bhaktavar Rasakhan wished that if he received the body of a human in the next vagina, then he should be able to live with the Gwalas of Gokul of Braj
 yadi kisi prakaar pashu hono pade, to phir nand kii gaayon ke saath charne kaa saubhaahgya praapt ho sake
 They have said- 3
 raskhaan ratnavali, pri0 65 Gaucharna has immense importance in the sports of Lord Sri Krishna and has been described with great gaiety by the devout poets of Braj, who according to the colors, cows like dhauri, dharmar, rati, pithri, gori, kajri, brown, shyama, Kapila etc
 Addressing by many names, he made a delightful statement of the love and affection of Bal Krishna towards him
 unka kahana he- There has been a traditional practice of donating in Brij on mangal occasions
 shri krishna ke janm ke samay nand ji ne anek sundar gaayon ko vivadh dhaatuon se mandit kar unka daan brahmanon ko kiya tha
 Referring to this, Surdas has said- keval brajvasi hindu hi nahin, varan bhartiya maatr ke liye gaay sadaa se shraddha or bhakthi kaa bhaajan rahi he
 It is a proud tradition to serve him, protect him and give his life in order to save him
 bharat ke hindu raja-maharaj hi nahin varan buddhivaan musalmaan badshaah bhi gauraksha kii vyavastha karte rahe hai

 Where the British had given many things of Akbar a place in their administration, there was no hindrance to cow slaughter, but the cow slaughter for cow meat in the British rule was not done in the Muslim rule as well
 
 idhar prakritik tathaa anya kaarnon se braj main gochar bhoomi or wanon kii bhi badi kami ho gai he
 As a result, where there was a large number of cows in Braj and whose rivers flowed in Braj of milk and curd, there was a saying, there has been a lot of reduction in the number of cows
 or doodh-dahi makkhan kaa to akaal pad gaya he
 Thus, this feature of Braj is now a thing of the past
 yahan kii gaayon kii nasl thi parivartit ho gai he or unke doodh kii maatra bhi ghat gai he
 At present, many religious communities have established many cowsheds in Braj Mandal for the re-establishment of the cow-dynasty in Braj, in which thousands of thousands of cows are being reared and protected, and in place of cow-rearing, cows and Gauupasna is named
 gaayon ke khan paan ke liye gauupasna naam diya gaya he
 Goupassers are offering grants from the country and abroad for the consumption of cows
 gopastami ke tyohaar par desh or videsh ke gauupaskon dwaara braj kii gaushalaon main pahunch kar gau-puja kaa utsav dhooma-dham ke saath manaaya jaataa he tathaa aam janata ke liye sthaan-sthaan par bhoj or bhandare kiye jate hai or goupalkon ko analp daan kiya jaataa he
 Other Pets - Bulls and buffaloes also have an important place in other pets of Braj
 braj main krishi kii kalpana bail ke bina aaj bhi nahin kii ja sakati he, chaahe tractor kaa kitna bhi adhik prachlan bad gaya he
 This sacrificial son of cow works in Braj to produce food and carry goods and buffalo is the main milk source in Braj for the present time
 bakrii, doodh or maance ke liye, ghode sawari or taange ke liye, kute ghar kii rakhwali ke liye, oont maal dhone ke liye, hathi utsav shauk ke liye, shookar maance ke liye, gadhe bojha ladane ke liye paale jate hai
 All these pets represent an essential and useful role in the life of Braj
 pashuon kii bhanti pakshi bhi paaltu or junglee do prakaar ke hote hai
 Among the domesticated birds are parrot, manna, pigeon, poultry, pheasant, quail sparrows etc
 junglee pakshiyon main praaia: mor, koyal, papiha, nilkanth, chakor, chakva, khanjan, bagula, gauraiya, ullu, chil, dhaura, teetar, bater aadi hai
 Some of them are very dear to Braj subjects due to their appearance and their dialect and some are unpleasant due to their absence
 priy pakshiyon ko hi praaia: banaaya jaataa he, kintu kuch junglee pakshi bhi atyant lokapriy hote hai
 Thus birds can be divided into two classes in terms of love and unpleasantness
 lokapriy pakshiyon main tota, mainaa, mor, koyal, papiha, nilkanth, kabutar, chakor, chakva, khanjan, shakun chidiya aadi hai
 Unpleasant birds include cova, eagle, owl, vulture, etc
 ukt samast pakshi braj mandal main bahutayat main paye jate hai
 Apart from these, many birds are also found in Braj
 braj samskruti or braj sahitya main paaltu or lokapriy pakshiyon kaa vishesh mahatva he
 Parrot and maina are particularly notable among such birds
 ye donon pakshi apni boli athwa vaani ke kaaran braj main sadaa se bade lokapriy rahe hai
 Traditional mentions of nurturing them from ordinary houses to palaces are received
 ye pakshi sikhaaye jane ke baad manushyon kii tarah bolne lagate hai tathaa manushyon jaise kartab karne lagate hai
 It is great entertainment to hear what they have been saying
 tota apane rup-rang main bhi bada sundar pakshi he, kintu mainaa kaa rang kaala hota he
 Many beautiful stories and stories related to these two birds are in abundance in Braj
 kabutar apane sundar rup, premi swabhaav or apni udaan ke liye sadaa se lokapriy rahaa he
 This bird never forgets its location
 ise chaahe jahaan uda diya jaay, kintu yah apane sthaan par hi vaapis pahunch jaataa he
 There is a big difference in the habits of a pigeon and a parrot, that no matter how many days the parrot is reared, but when it is blown, it usually does not return to its place
 lokranjan ke atirikt kabutaron kaa sainik kaaryon main bhi upyog hota rahaa he
 There has been a tradition of sending important messages by pigeons since ancient times
 murga-murgi or teetar, bater paalan ke pramaan pracheen kaal main bhi paye jate hai

 Chaplin was assigned to Normand, who directed and wrote some of his first films

 "I didn't know how to do makeup

 But going towards the wardrobe, i thought i would wear baggy pants, big shoes, a stick and a derby hat
 i wanted everything to contradict: baggy pants, tight coats, small hats and big shoes

 Chaplin considered the Mutual Period the happiest period of his career, although he had other concerns that the films were formulaic during that time, due to the stringent production schedules that his contract required
 vishwa yudgh main america ke pravesh ke baad, chaplin apane kareebi dost duglas ferebanks or meri picleford ke saath ek swatantraaa bands ke pravaktaa ban gaye
 Most of Chaplin's films were distributed in the Keystone, Essene, and Mutual periods
 After Chaplin took control of his productions in 1918, industrialists met his demand by bringing back Chaplin's old humor
 filmon ko phir se gadha gaya, punah sheershak gadha gaya or baar-baar pun: prachlit kiya gaya, pehle cinemagharon ke liye, phir grih film bazaar or haal ke varshon main, grih video ke liye
 Essene was also guilty of this practice, creating 'new' Chaplin humor from old film clips and rejected performances

 film nirmaan kii takanic The Bond Chaplin never talked about his filmmaking methods more than the censor, claiming that doing so would be like breaking the illusion of a magician
 vastav main, 1940 main dooylaag bole jane vaali film da great dictator bananaa shuru karne tak chaplin ne kabhi puri taiyaar script main kaam nahin kiya tha
 He developed this method when his Essene contract gave him the opportunity to write and direct his own films, starting with an obscure campus - for example "charlie entered a health spa" or "charlie was a moneylender
" Work in the shop

 As the structure of a narrative emerged by accepting and discarding ideas, Chaplin often needed to shoot back the entire issue in advance, which would otherwise contradict the story
 Chaplin's unique film-making technique was his Known after death, in the 1983 British documentary Unknown Chaplin, he carefully examined the rare surviving rejected shot and cut sequence
 yah ek vajah he ki chaplin apane pratidwandviyon ke mukaable apni filmon ko puri karne main zyada samay lagaate the
 In addition, Chaplin was an incredibly demanding director, performing his actors exactly as he wanted and taking countless shots until he got the shot he wanted

 While the Modern Times was silent, it had conversations — mostly coming from inanimate objects such as the radio or a TV monitor
 It was done to help 1930s viewers who were not used to watching silent movies, so that they Be adjusted to the dialogue film
 Modern Times was the first film in which Chaplin's voice was heard
 However, many viewers still consider it a silent film — and the end of an era

 He considered cinema to be basically a silent drama art
 unhone kaha: "aamtaur par angavikshep ko shabd se zyada aasaani se samajha jaataa he
 Like Chinese symbols, the meaning differs according to the dramatic meaning

 From Chaplin's last film, "this Is My Song", in the 1960s, "A Countess from Hong Kong" was first-class in several different languages, and Chaplin's theme from Limelight was successful in the 1950s under the title "eternally"

 But his films of the 1930s were openly political

 The final dramatic speech in The Great Dictator, which was without question important to patriotic nationalism, and his outspoken public support for opening a second European border to aid the Soviet Union in World War II in 1942, were controversial
 un bhaashanon main se kam se kam ek main, dainik kaaryakarta main ek samakaleen vivaran ke anusaar, unhone suchit kiya tha ki dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad samyawad duniya main fail jayega or ise maanav pragati ke baraabar bataaya gaya tha

 After the film, Chaplin gave up interest in making films on direct political messages, later stating that comedians and clowns should be "above politics"

 This never happened, perhaps because of fear of Chaplin's ability to satirize investigators
 1952 main chaplin ne US chhod diya, jise united kingdom main landan ke liye limlite ke premier ke liye ek sankshipt yatra ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha
 Hoover finds the trip and talks with the Immigration and Civil Service to revoke Chaplin's re-entry, to deport Chaplin so that he cannot return for his alleged political leanings
 chaplin ne sanyukt rajya america main punah pravesh naa karne kaa faisla kiya, yah likhte hue ki, " xxrep 5

 During his working years as a filmmaker, Chaplin expressed disdain for the Academy Award; His son Charles Jr
 wrote that Chaplin was angered by the academy in the 1930s, jokingly using the 1929 Oscars to block the door
 isi vajah se city lits or modern times, jo kii kai chunaavon main filmon kii do sarvshereshth film maani gai, unhen ek bhi academy puraskaar ke liye namjad nahin kiya gaya tha

 In his illustrated autobiography "my Life in Pictures" published in 1974, Chaplin stated that he had written a screenplay for his daughter Victoria; In the title The Freak, she will appear as an angel
 chaplin ke anusaar, film kii ek script puri ho gai thi or purv-nirmaan purvaabhyas bhi shuru ho chuke the, lekin yah roak diya tha jab unki shaadi hui
 Chaplin wrote "i'll make it sometime"
 But, in the 1970s, his health deteriorated significantly, which hampered all expectations of filmmaking
 1969 se 1976 tak, chaplin ne apni mook filmon ke liye mul sangeet rachanaaen or swar lipiyaan likhin or unhen punah release kiya

 yadi inamen se do rashiyaan gyaat hon to teesri un donon par nishchit prakaar se nirbhar hogi or uskaa maan avasthaa sameekaran se maaloom kiya ja saktaa he
 The laws of Biel and Charles derive the PV = RT relation, which is the phase equation for the ideal gas
 gaisen ucch taap or daab kii paristhatiyon main iskaa nikatataa se paalan karti hai kintu saamaanya paristhitiyon main yah sameekaran kisi bhi vaastavik gas kaa vyavhaar yatharthata se vyakt nahin karata
 Real gases deviate greatly from the ideal gas equation, which was later confirmed by Naterer, Sendreuse, and Keane, using more pressure
 andrus ke prayog moulik mahatv ke hai kyonki ve gaison ke vaastavik vyavhaar par bahut prakaash daalate hai or us mahatvapurn avasthaa sameekaran ke aadhaar hai jiskaa pratipaadan vandervals ne kiya he
 The condition equation of vandarwals is as follows: jahaan a { \ displaystyle a} evam b { \ displaystyle b} niyatank hai jo gas vishesh par nirbhar karte hai
 Their value can be derived from the revolutionary properties
 p c , t c { \ displaystyle p_{c},t_{c}} evam v c { \ displaystyle V_{c}} You can also write it this way- san 1873 main prastaavit is sameekaran se adarsh gas sameekaran kii apeksha kaaphi behatar parinaam mili
 In this equation, a { \ displaystyle a} is called the attraction parameter and b { \ displaystyle b} is the repulsion parameter or effective molecular volume
 yah sameekaran adarsh gas avasthaa se honevaale adhikansh vichalnon kaa samaadhaan kar detaa he
 Several other state observations have been proposed
 unamem se kuch vishisht simaaon ke bich vandervals sameekaran se adhik satya hai
 Yet given the simplicity of this equation, it is generally sufficiently close to the behavior of real gases

 xunosis kii ek saral paribhaasha he ek rog jo kasheruk jaanwaron se duusare main preshit kiya ja saktaa he
 a slightly more technical definition is a disease that normally infects other animals, but can also infect humans

 The emerging interdisciplinary field of protected medicine that integrates human and animal medicine and environmental science is largely related to zoonosis
 sankramak jeev agenton kii ek aanshik suchi joki junotic ho saktaa he neeche soochibaddh hai Xenozoonosis xenotransplantation dwaara sancharit zoonosis he 
 Zanos can be listed according to the infectious agent: anya junos ho sakate he: Prehistory was 150 of the individuals of most human beings, as hunter bands spent smaller than the banders, rarely these were larger than the band and often were not in contact with other bands very much, because of this, or pandemic epidemic disease, depend Developed an immune response, but not a human who runs through a population of constant floods which burn out after its first run
 To survive, a biological pathogen was a chronic infection, living for long periods of time, surviving in the host, or by passing the reservoir into a non-human while in fact, the host waits for new living For many diseases 'human', the host human was actually the victim of an accident and eventually died of anthrax, rabies, tulmeria, west nile virus and many other cases
 Area was with rabies | 
 Thus, zoonotic epidemic diseases in relation to human development, kai aadhunik rogon, bhi mahamari rog, junotic rogon ke rup main baahar shuru kar diya

 Likewise, in the recent times of avian influenza and the West Nile virus, more human populations have probably dropped into populations due to the relationship between the carrier host and domestic animals
 Highly mobile animals such as bats and birds may present a greater risk of zoonotic transmission from animals due to the ease with which they can move in areas of human habitation

 The scientific study of the results of the interrelations of the sounds of the string, or the string, stretched for the music by the father, was done by his son Galileo
 is adhyayan ko karne ke dauraan balak galileo ke man main sugrahita purna prayog karte huye unke parinamo ko aatmsaat karne kii prerana pradaan kii
 He is considered the father of exam oriented science
 inhone dolan kaa sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He invented binoculars
 usne doordarshee yantra ko adhik unnat banaaya
 With his help, he took many astronomical observations and supported the theory of Copernicus
 unhen aadhunik praayogic khagoliki kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He found that the laws of nature are influenced by each other's factors and there is a relation between the increase and decrease of one as in the equations of mathematics
 isaliye unhone kaha kih-‘ ishwar kii bhashaa ganit he
 'this great mathematician and scientist only dared to measure the speed of light
 iske liye galileo or unka ek sahaayak andheri raat main kai mile dur sthit do pahaad kii chotiyon par ja baithe
 From where Galileo lit the lantern, after getting his assistant's signal, they were to indicate the light through the lantern and its knock
 duusari pahari par sthit unke sahaayak ko laalaten kaa prakaash dekhakar apane paas rakhi duusari laalaten kaa khatka hataakar punah sanket karnaa tha
 Thus Galileo had to estimate the speed of light by looking at the light on the top of the second mountain 
 is prakaar galileo ne jo parinaam paaya vah bahut seemaa tak vaastavik to na tha parantu prayogon kii aavruti or safalataa asafalataa ke baad hi abhisht parinaam paane kii jo muhim unke dwaara prarambh kii gayi vah adwitiya thi
 In due course, Albert Einstein, the great scientist who solved the intricate relationship between the speed of light and the relationship of energy, referred to him as 'father of modern science'
 galileo dharmik pravruth ke the parantu puraani dharmik manyataon ko vivekshiltaa or prayog ke madhyam se sidv karnaa chaahate the
 In the year 1609, Galileo discovered a telescope that was invented in Holland, with the help of this telescope, one could study their motion by looking at distant celestial bodies
 galileo ne iskaa vivaran sunakar swayan aisi doorabeen kaa nirmaan kar daalaa jo holland main avishkrut doorabeen se kahin adhik shaktishaalee thi
 Based on this, through his observations and experiments, Galileo found that all the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun, contrary to the prevailing beliefs in the universe
 isse purv copernicus ne bhi yah kaha tha ki prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he jiske liye unhe carch kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa tha
 Now, based on the results based on experimentation and discretion, Galilea found it to be the same
 us samay tak yah sarvamaanya sidwant tha ki brahmand ke kendra main prithvi sthit he tathaa surya or chandramaa sahit sabhi akashiya pind lagaataar prithvi kii parikrama karte he
 This recognition was supported by the religious leaders of Tadsamay
 apane prayogon ke aadhaar par praapt parinaamon ke kaaran galileo ne puraani avadharanaon ke virudv khadey hone kaa nirnay liya
 When Galileo made this doctrine public, the Church considered it his disobedience and for this disobedience Galileo was sentenced to imprisonment on behalf of the Church
 galileo ke dwaara diye gayi vichaar ne tadsamay manushya ke chintan kii disha ke naye rup main swikaarne ko vivash kar diya
 Due to social and religious persecution, he could not stand for long with the theories, contrary to the prevailing beliefs and beliefs
 varsh 1633 main 69 varshiya vrudv galileo ko carch kii ore se yah aadesh diya gaya ki ve saarvajanik taur par maafee maangate huye yah kahen ki dharmik manyataon ke virudv diye gayi unke sidwant unke jivan kii sabase bady bhul thi jiske liye ve sharminda hai
 He did the same, but even after this he was imprisoned
 unka swasthya lagaataar bigadta rahaa or isi ke chalate karawas kii sajaa grih-kaid arthath apane hi ghar main kaid main rahane kii sajaa main badal diya gaya
 He also spent the last day of his life in this prison
 hameshaa se pope kii nigaraanee main rahane vaali vatican city sthit isaai dharm kii sarvacch sanstha ne 1992 main yah sweekaar kiya kiya ki galileo ke maamle main nirnay lene main unase galati huyi thi
 Thus, it took more than three and a half years for the Church to accept its historical error by ordering a 1633 order regarding Galileo, a great astronomer, mathematician, physicist and philosopher
 varsh 1609 main doorabeen ke nirmaan or khagoleey pindon ke prekshan kii ghatana ke chaar sau saalon ke baad 400veen jayanti ke rup main varsh 2009 ko antarrashtriya khagoliki varsh ke rup main manaakar is mahaan vaigyanik ko shradwanjali arpit kar apni bhul kaa praashchitya karne kaa prayaas kiya

 In ancient times, when there was no instrument to learn the direction, then the direction of the pole star was learned
 saptarshi taramandal main kai gallexiyaan bhi pai gai hai
 Among them is a spiral galaxy called Massie 81, one of the most illuminating galaxies in the sky

 The languages related among themselves are called language families
 koun bhashaayen kis parivaar main aati hai, inke liye vaigyanik aadhaar hai
 There are three stages in the languages of the world at this time
 vibhinn deshon kii pracheen bhashaayen jinka adhyayan or vargeekaran paryaapt saamagree ke abhaav main nahin ho sakaa he, pehali avasthaa main he
 Their existence is still preserved in the ancient inscriptions, coins and handwritten books available in them
 mesopotemia kii puraani bhashaa ‘sumereey’ tathaa italy kii pracheen bhashaa ‘etrascan’ isi tarah kii bhashaayen hai
 In the second stage, there are modern languages, which have not been able to study and divide despite the abundant material in the absence of proper research
 bask, bushman, japani, korian, andamani aadi bhashaayen isi avasthaa main hai
 There is enough material in the languages of the third stage and they have been studied and classified
 greek, arabi, farsi, sanskrit, angreji aadi anek viksit evam samrudh bhashaayen iske antargat hai
 Language is related to person, society and country
 isliye prayek bhashaa kii nijee visheshta hoti he
 On the basis of these, she establishes equality with some languages on one hand and inequality with many languages on the other
 mukhyatah yah vaishishtagat samya-vaishamy do prakaar kaa hota he–akritimulak or arthtatva sambandhi
 Under the first, the similarity of the shape of the words i
e
 the composition of words and sentences is seen
 duusare main arthtatva kii samanta rahati he
 According to them, there are two methods of classification of languages - morphological and family or historical
 is vivechan kaa sambandh aitihaasik vargeekaran se he isliye uske aadhaaron ko thodaa vistaar se jaan lenaa chahie
 In addition to morphological similarities, it should also have the following similarities
 bhugolic drushti se praayah samipsth bhashaaon main samanta or duurastha bhashaaon main asamanta paayi jaati he
 On this basis, the languages of the world are divided into African, Eurasia, Pacific and oceanic sections
 kintu yah aadhaar bahut adhik vaigyanik nahin he
 Because two adjacent languages can be different from each other and two remote languages are mutually similar
 bharat kii hindi or malayalam do bhinn parivaar kii bhashaayen hai kintu bharat or england jaise duurastha deshon kii sanskrit or angreji ek hi parivaar kii bhashaayen hai
 The languages in which similar words prevail are kept under a clan
 yah samanta bhashaa-bhashiyon kii sameeptha par aadhaarit he or do tarah se sambhav hoti he
 Equality comes when words of the same society, caste or family are treated equally
 iske atirikt jab bhinn desh athwa jati ke log sabhyataa or sadhano ke viksit ho jane par raajnneetik athwa vyavsaayik hetu se ek-duusare ke sampark main aate hai to shabdon ke aadan-pradaan dwaara unamem samanta sthapit ho jaati he
 The first type of conformity is useful for family classification
 kyonki aise shabd bhashaa ke mul shabd hote hai
 In these also, the words nouns, pronouns etc
 used in the family life of Nityaprati are more useful
 is aadhaar main sabase badi kathinaayee yah hoti he ki anya bhashaaon se aaye hue shabd bhashaa ke viksit hote rahane se mul shabdon main aise ghulmil jate hai ki unako pahchaan kar alag karnaa kathin ho jaataa he
 The solution to this difficulty is semantic equality to a extent
 kyonki ek parivaar kii bhashaaon ke anek shabd arth kii drushti se samaan hote hai or aise shabd unhen ek parivaar se sambandhit karte hai
 Therefore, semantic similarity is also an important basis
 prayek bhashaa kaa apana dhwani-siddhanth or uccharan-niyam hota he
 This is why she is not as quickly affected by the sounds of other languages and, as far as possible, replaces them with their nearest sounds according to phonemes
 jaise farsi kii k, kha, fa aadi dhvaniyaan hindi main nikatavarti k, kha, pha aadi main parivartit hoti he
 Hence the basis of phonology is more reliable than syllogism
 vaise kabhi-kabhi ek bhashaa ke dhvanisamooh main duusari bhashaa kii dhvaniyaan bhi milakar viksit ho jaati hai or tulanaatmak nishkarshon ko bhraamak kar detii hai
 The Aryan languages did not have idyllic sounds before the Vedic period, but developed further under the influence of the Dravidian language
 vyakaranik aadhaar sabase adhik pramanik hota he
 Because it does not change quickly due to language discipline
 vyakaran kii samanta ke antargat dhaatu, dhaatu main pratyay lagaakar shabd-nirmaan vyakaranik prakriya dwaara shabdon se padon kii rachana tathaa vaakyon main pad-vinyas ke niyam aadi kii samanta kaa nirdhaaran aavashyak he
 Classification of languages is done on these four grounds, ensuring maximum equality
 is sambandh main spashtrup se samaj lenaa chahie ki yah samya-vaishamy saapekshik he
 While on the one hand, the languages of the European family are different from those of the other family languages and on the other hand, on the other hand, the Indian languages of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek etc
 are also different from each other on the same basis
 vargeekaran karte samay sabase pehle bhugolic sameeptha ke aadhaar par sampurna bhashaayen uresia, prashantmahasaagar, africa or america khandon athwa chakron main vibhakt hoti hai
 Then different families are made by keeping the languages with mutual similarities in a clan or family
 avesta, farsi, sanskrit, greek aadi kii tulana se pataa chalaa ki unki shabdaawalee, dhvanisamooh or rachana-paddati main kaaphi samanta he
 Therefore, an Indian family has been made of such languages of India and Europe
 pariwaron ko virgon main vibhakt kiya gaya he
 Shatam and Cantum are similar classes in the indo-european family
 virgon kaa vibhaajan shaashaon main hua he
 The 'iranian' and 'bharatiya Arya' are the main branches of the Shatam class
 shakhaon ko upashakha main baanta gaya he
 Grierson has divided modern Indian Aryan languages into inner and outer subdivisions
 atah main upashakhaayen bhashaa-samudaayon or samudaay bhashaaon main bantate hai
 In this way language is a unit of family-classification
 is samay bhaaropee parivaar kii bhashaaon kaa adhyayan itnaa ho chukaa he ki yah purna prakriya us par lagu ho jaati he
 There may be slight manipulation of these names, but there is usually no difference in the stages of this process
 unnisvin shatee main hi vidwaanon kaa dhyaan sansar kii bhashaaon ke vargeekaran kii ore aakrisht hua or aaj tak samay-samay par anek vidwaanon ne apane alag-alag vargeekaran prastut kiye hai; kintu abhi tak koi vaigyanik or pramanik vargeekaran prastut nahin ho sakaa he
 There is a big difference among linguists regarding this problem
 yahi kaaran he ki jahaan ek ore federikh mular in pariwaron kii sankhya 100 tak maanate hai vahaan duusari ore rice vishwa kii samast bhashaaon ko keval ek hi parivaar main rakhte hai
 But most scholars consider them to be twelve or thirteen
 duniya bhar main boli jane vaali qareeb saat hazaar bhashaaon ko kam se kam das pariwaron main vibhajit kiya jaataa he jinamein se pramukh pariwaron kaa zikr neeche he : Main article indo-european language family yah samooh bhashaaon kaa sabase bada parivaar he or sabase mahatvapurn bhi he kyonki angrezi,roosi, pracheen farsi, hindi, punjabi, german - ye tamaam bhashaayen isi samooh se sambandh rakhti hai
 It is also called 'indo-european language family'
 vishwa jansankhya ke lagbhag aadhe log bhaaropee bhashaa bolte hai
 Classical languages like Sanskrit, Greek and Latin also belong to this group
 lekin arabi ek bilkul vibhinn parivaar se sambandh rakhti he
 The ancient languages of this family were extroverted scholastic-yogic

 Mr
 Rajendra Singh has named this language family 'nag Bhasha Parivar' in the context of India
 ise 'ekakshar parivaar' bhi kehete hai
 The reason is that its root words are often monosyllabic
 ye bhashaayen kashmir, himachal pradesh, uttaranchal, nepal, sikkim, pashchim bengal, bhutan, arunachal pradesh, assam, nagaland, meghalaya, manipur, tripura or mizoram main boli jaati hai
 Its major languages included Arami, Asseri, Sumeri, Akkadi, and Canaanite, but the best-known languages of the group today are Arabic and Hebrew
 in bhashaaon main mukhyatah teen dhaatu-akshar hote hai or bich main swar ghusaakar inase kriya or sangyaayen banaayi jaati hai 
 The Dravidian family of languages is interesting in the sense that although these languages are spoken in the southern regions of India, they have no connection with the languages spoken in the northern region

 Some 26 languages of the Dravidian group are spoken in southern India and Sri Lanka but the more famous among them are Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada

 Arabic and Persian had a great influence on Turkey, but nowadays its vocabulary has a lot of its own
 dhwani or shabdaawalee kii drushti se is kul kii ural or altaai bhashaayen ek-duusare se kaaphi bhinn hai
 Therefore some scholars are also in favor of keeping them in two separate clans, but of course on grammatical similarity, they are languages of the same clan
