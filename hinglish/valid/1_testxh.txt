 jab pandit gopaldaas ne unase kaha ki ve drishtiheen hone se is kaary main asamarth hai, to shanidev unase bole- 'apni ankhen kholo, ab tum sab kuch dekh sakoge
 ' ankhen kholane par pandit gopaldaas ne paaya ki unka andhatv dur ho gaya he or ve sabakuch saaf-saaf dekh sakate hai
 After getting sight, Panditji started digging the mound
 unki ankhen thik hone kii vajah se anya logon ko bhi unke swapn kii baat par yakeen ho gaya tathaa ve khudaai main unki madad karne lage
 After digging the entire mound, Panditji's dream came true and a statue of Shani Dev emerged out of it
 baahar nikaalkar uski sthapana kii gai
 The same statue is installed in this temple today
 is pratimaa ke ek or chamatkaar kii katha prasiddh he
 It is said that the statue of Shani Dev was earlier in place of the statue of Lord Rama currently installed in the temple
 ek shanichari amavasya par yah pratimaa swatah apana sthaan badalakar iske vartmaan sthaan par aa gai
 Since then Shani Dev has been worshiped at the same place and it has become the center of the archaic faith of the devotees
 har varsh shani jayanti par is mandir main utsav manaaya jaataa he
 During this festival famous musicians of India pay reverence to Shani Dev by performing their music

 The Prime Minister ultimately has control over all activities and policies of the Federal Government and the Union Cabinet
 kendriya mantriyon kii niyukti va nishkasana bhi antytah pradhanmantri hi karte hai
 However, the Prime Minister cannot do the appointment, expulsion and other such functions of the ministers themselves
 mantriyon kii niyukti va nishkasana raashtrapati dwaara pradhanmantri ke salaah par hota he
 The Constitution of India respectively promulgates a number of legislations that have legally ensured that in normal circumstances, in the case of the executive, the President should have only nominal powers, while the actual powers are in the hands of the Prime Minister
 samvidhan ne pradhanmantri or raashtrapati kii shaktiyon ko bhaag 5 ke vibhinn anuchhedon main kuch is prakaar ankit kiya gaya he: Generally, the Prime Minister is appointed by the President on the basis of the result of the parliamentary general election
 pradhanmantri, loksabhaa main bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa hote hai
 Although the Prime Minister does not have to be a Lok Sabha MP himself, he has to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha and become a member of Parliament within six months of his appointment
 pradhanmantri sansad ke donon sadanon main se kisi bhi ek sadan ke sadsy ho sakate hai
 Historically, there have been many Prime Ministers who were Rajya sabha-mps; In 1966, Indira Gandhi, Deve Gowda and more recently Manmohan Singh, were Rajya sabha-mps
 prayek chunaav pashchaat, naveen sabha kii baithak main bahumat daal ke netaa ke chunaav ke baad, raashtrapati, bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa ko pradhanmantri banane hetu aamantrit karte hai, aamantran sweekaar karne ke pashchaat, sambandhit vyakti ko loksabhaa main matdaan dwaara vishwasamat praapt karnaa hota he
 Thereafter the order of confidence is passed on to the President, after which the Prime Minister and other ministers are administered the oath of office and they are appointed as Prime Ministers at a ceremony
 yadi koi ek dal yaa gathbandhan, loksabhaa main bahumat praapt karne main aksham hota he, to, yah purnatah mahamahim raashtrapati ke vivek par nirbhar hota he ki ve kis vyakti ko pradhanmantripad praapt karne hetu aamantrit karen
 Such a situation is called a state of hung assembly
 trishanku sabha kii sthiti main raashtrapati saadharantah sabase bade dal ke netaa ko nimnasadan main bahumat siddh karne hetu aamantrit karte he
 It is mandatory for a person who accepts the invitation to prove his trust in the Lok Sabha and only then can that person be appointed Prime Minister
 aitihaasik taur par, is visheshadhikaar kaa prayog anek avasaron par vibhinn raashtrapatigan kar chuke hai
 After the resignation of Prime Minister Morarji Desai by President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy in 1977, Chaudhary Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, exercising this same privilege
 iske alaava bhi is visheshadhikaar kaa upyog kar, raashtrapatigan ne 1989 main rajeev gandhi or vishwanath pratap singh, 1991 main narsingh raav tathaa 1996 or 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ko pradhanmantripad par niyukt karne ke liye kiya he
 The cabinet is made up of ministers selected by the Prime Minister and appointed by the President
 bhartiya samvidhan, pradhanmantri pad hetu kisi prakaar kii vishesh arhataayen nirdisht nahin karata he
 But one need has been fixed: the Prime Minister should have the membership of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, and they should have majority support in Lok Sabha
 yadi niyukti ke samay paatr, bhartiya sansad ke do sadanon main se kisi bhi sadan kaa sadsy nahin hota he to niyukti ke 6 maheenon ke madhya hi unhen sansad kii sadsyta praapt karnaa anivaary he anyathaa unka pradhanmantritv khaarij ho jaayegaa
 Therefore, the claimant to the Prime Minister must have all the qualifications to be an MP
 bhartiya samvidhan ke pancham bhaag kaa 84vaan anuchhed, ek saansad kii arhataaon ko nirdisht karata he, uske anusaar: a person shall be qualified to be elected to fill a place in Parliament only when— jaisaa ki tisare bindu main vinirdisht he, paatr ko sansad dwaara bhavishya main paarit paatrata ke kisi bhi yogayata par khara utaarna hoga tathaa kyonki pradhanmantri kaa saansad hona anivaary he, atah pradhanmantritv ke paatr ko loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha kaa sadsy hone yogya hone hetu, kuch anya arhataaon par bhi khara utarana hota he, jinamein uskaa vikrut charitra vaala vyakti yaa diwalia ghoshit naa hona, swechha se kisi videshi rajya kii naagarikta praapt kar lenaa, kisi nyaayalay dwaara uskaa nirvachan shunya ghoshit kar diya janaa, tathaa raashtrapati yaa rajyapal niyukt hona shaamil hai
 Also, an eligible person should not be an employee of any beneficial post in the service of any office and administrative or non-administrative body under the Central Government, any State Government or any of the aforesaid Government
 saath hi sadan se prastaav-sweekrut nishkasana se bhi paatr kii sadsyta samaapt ho jaati he
 After the appointment, the Prime Minister's disqualification, on any of the foregoing qualifications, is proved in a legal court, then the election of that person is declared void, and he is expelled from the post of Prime Minister
 
 pradhanmantri ko pad kii shapath raashtrapati dwaara dilaai jaati he
 For appointment to the post, the prospective officer is required to take two oaths
 ye donon shapath bhartiya samvidhan kii teesri anusuchee main vinirdisht hai, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 or 219): Types of Pledge or Affirmation: 1 mantripad kii shapath kaa praaroop : 2 Form of Oath of Privacy: saiddhanthik rupatah, padasth pradhanmantri, "raashtrapati ke prasadparyant", apane pad par bana rahata he
 Unlike the President, no time limit has been set for the Prime Minister's term
 atah ek padasth pradhanmantri anishchit kaal tak pradhanmantripad par bana rah saktaa he, basharte ki raashtrapati ko usapar "vishwaas" ho
 The real meaning of this is that a person can hold the post of Prime Minister only as long as the majority in the Lok Sabha is in his favor
 baharhaal, loksabhaa kaa puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh hota he, jiske baad nae chunaav karaaye jate hai, or naveen sabha punah pradhanmantri ke paksh main vishwasamat paarit karti he, yadi nav-nirvaachit sabha pradhanmantri main avishvaas ghoshit kar detii he to phir pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it can be said that the Prime Minister has a full term of 5 years, after which he is reviewed again
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon se purv hi samaapt ho saktaa he, yadi kisi karanvash, loksabhaa sarkaar ke virodh main avishvaas mat paarit kare athwa yadi kisi karanvash, pradhanmantri kii sansad kii sadsyta shunaya ghoshit ho jaae to pradhanmantri, kisi bhi samay, apane pad kaa tyaag, raashtrapati ko ek likhit tyaagptr saunp ke kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Morarji Desai was the first Prime Minister of the country to relinquish his office during his tenure
 pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal par naa hi kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa he naa koi aayu seemaa nirdisht kii gai he
 India Gateway bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 74 main spasht rup se mantriparishad kii adhyakshata tathaa sanchaalan hetu pradhanmantri kii upasthiti aavashyak maanata he
 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah akele hi mantri parishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he
 All policy decisions are taken by him
 raashtrapati tathaa mantri parishad ke madhyasampark sutara bhi vahi he
 He is also the principal spokesman of the Council of Ministers
 vah parishad ke naam se ladi jane vaali sansadeey bahason kaa netritv karata he
 He can participate in any debate being fought in favor of the Council in Parliament
 mantri gana ke madhya samanvay bhi vahi karata he
 He can ask for any information from any ministry
 in sab karnow ke chalate pradhanmantri ko bharat kaa sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik vyaktitv mana jaataa he
 The most important reason for the dominance and importance of the Indian Prime Minister is the executive powers conferred on his office bearers
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 74 pradhanmantri ke pad ko sthapit karata he, evam yah nirdisht karata he ki ek mantriparishad hogi jiskaa mukhiya pradhanmantri hoga, jo bharat ke raashtrapati ko "salaah or sahaayta" pradaan karenge
 And Article 75 establishes that the appointment of ministers will be done by the President as per the advice of the Prime Minister, and the minister will also be given various assignments as per the advice of the President, Prime Minister
 atah samvidhan yah nirdisht karata he kii, jahaan sanvaidhanik kaaryakari adhikaar bharat ke raashtrapati ke paas he, parantu kyonki in sambandhon main bharat ke raashtrapati keval pradhanmantri kii salaahnusaar kaary karte hai, atah vaastavik rup se, in kaaryakari adhikaron kaa prayog pradhanmantri apni icchaanusaar karte hai
 The constitution establishes by these legislations that as the head of the nation of India, the Prime Minister shall exercise all the executive powers vested indirectly, and will be the head of the entire Council of Ministers and constitution of the Council of Ministers by Article 75, appointment of ministers
 And his assignment has also been left to the will of the Prime Minister, but also the ministers and ministers
 The Constitution, the Prime Minister in relation to schools provides complete freedom
 pradhanmantri, apane mantrimandal main kisi bhi vyakti ko shaamil kar sakate he, nikaal sakate he, niyukt kar sakate hai yaa nilambit karvaa sakate hai
 Since ministers are appointed by the President only on the advice of the Prime Minister, it means that the Council of Ministers is actually created by people of the Prime Minister's choice, in which they can change at any time of their choice
 saath hi mantriyon ko vibhinn kaarybhaar pradaan karnaa bhi purnatah pradhanmantri kii ichha par nirbhar karata he; ve apane mantriyon main se kisi ko bhi koi bhi mantralay yaa kaarybhaar saunp sakati hai, chin sakate hai yaa doosraa koi kaarybhaar / mantralay saunp sakate hai
 In these cases there is no constitutional obligation of any kind to the Prime Minister to consult the ministers concerned, or to obtain their permission
 balki mantriyon va mantralayon ke vishay main purvakthith kisi bhi maamle main sambandhit mantri yaa mantriyon kii salaah yaa anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 They can also ask any minister to resign from the minister any time they want, and if that minister refuses to resign, they can ask the president to suspend him from office
 mantriyon kii niyukti evam mantralayon ke aavnton ke alaava, mantrimandaleey sabhaayen, cabinet kii gatividhiyaan or sarkaar kii nitiyon par bhi pradhanmantri kaa puraa niyantran hota he
 The Prime Minister is the constitutional head and leader of the Council of Ministers
 ve sansad evam anya manchon par mantriparishad kaa pratinidhitiv karte he
 They preside over cabinet meetings, and decide the agenda of these meetings, and other topics of discussion
 balki cabinet baithkon main uthne vaale saare maamle va vishaysoochee, pradhanmantri kii hi sweekruti va sahmati se nirdhaarit kiye jate hai
 It is at the will of the Prime Minister to approve or reject various proposals that arise in cabinet meetings
 haalaanki, charchaa karne or apane nijee suzav va prastaavon ko baithak ke samaksh rakhane kii swatantraaa har mantri ko he, parantu antytah vahi prastaav yaa nirnay liya jaataa he, jisapar pradhanmantri kii sahmati ho or nirnay paarit kiye jane ke pashchaat use puure mantriparishad kaa antim nirnay mana jaataa he, or sabhi mantriyon ko pradhanmantri ke us nirnay ke saath chalanaa hota he
 Therefore, it can be said that as a constitutionally, the Prime Minister has complete control and unchallenged dominance over the Union Cabinet
 niyantran ke maamle main pradhanmantri, mantriparishad kaa sarvesarva hota he, or uske istife se puri sarkaar gir jaati he, arthath saare mantriyon kaa mantritv samaapt ho jaataa he
 Apart from the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, the Constitution vests another special privilege on the Prime Minister, this privilege being the mid-contact thread between the Council of Ministers and the President
 yah visheshadhikaar keval pradhanmantri ko diya gaya he, jiske madhyam se pradhanmantri samay-samay par, raashtrapati ko mantrisabha main liye jane vaale nirnay or charchaaon se sambandhit jaankaree se raashtrapati ko adhishuchet karaate rahete hai
 No minister other than the Prime Minister can voluntarily reveal to the President any of the subjects discussed in the Council
 yah visheshadhikaar kii mahatv va arth yah he kii mantrimandaleey sabhaaon main charchit vishyon main se kin jaankariyon ko gopneey rakhana he, evam kin jaankariyon ko duniya ke saamne prastut karnaa he, yah tay karne kaa adhikaar bhi pradhanmantri ke paas he
 The Prime Minister works as the Chief Manager of the various organs of the state, whose job is to get all the departments and organs of the state to do the work as they wish
 sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon or mantralayon ke bich samanvay bananaa, or cabinet dwaara liye gaye nirnyon ko karyanvit karwaanaa tathaa vibhinn vibhaagon ko nirdeshit karnaa bhi unka kaam he
 It is also their job to resolve administrative differences between ministries and departments and take final decisions
 sarkari kaaryon ke karyanvayan ke alaava bhi, sarkari tantra par pradhanmantri kaa atyadhik prabhaav or pakad hota he
 Being the head of government and government, all the executive appointments are actually made by the Prime Minister
 saare ucchstareey adhikari va padaadhikari pradhanmantri, apane pasand ke hi niyukt karte hai
 These appointments include high-advisors and high officials of government ministries and offices, governors of various states, attorney generals, auditors, overlords of public service commissions, and other members, ambassadors of various countries, consulars, etc
 yah saare ucchstareey niyuktiyaan, bharat ke raashtrapati dwaara, pradhanmantri kii salaah par kiye jate hai
 Being the head of the government and the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority and the leader of the ruling house and the principal representative in the Lok Sabha
 is sandarbh main, sadan main sarkaar or sattapaksh kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa pradhanmantri kaa karttavya mana jaataa he
 At the same time it is expected that the Prime Minister will make important bills and announcements taken by the government in the House and the Prime Minister will answer from the ruling side about those important decisions
 loksabhaa adhyaksh kaa chunaav, nirvachan dwaara hota he, atah saadharantah, sabhapati bhi bahumat daal kaa hota he
 Therefore, being the leader of the majority of pulses, through the Speaker, the Prime Minister also has the ability to influence the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in a limited way, as the Chairman is the Speaker of the House, and the Chairman also determines the table of contents in the House
 However, the action of the House cannot be affected to a greater extent
 in kartavyon ke alaava, sansadeey karrwai ko par pradhanmantri kaa sabase mahatvapurn shakti he, loksabhaa satr bulaane or satrant karne kii shakti
 Article 85 of the constitution gives the President of India the right to call and end the session of the Lok Sabha, but in this case the President has to act according to the advice of the Prime Minister
 arthath vaastavikrupe, loksabhaa kaa satr bulaanaa or ant karnaa pradhanmantri ke haathon main hota he
 This right is, undoubtedly, the most important right given in the hands of the Prime Minister, which gives him an opportunity to have limited control not only on his party but also on the activities of the opposition mps
 sarkaar or desh ke netaa hone ke naate, vaishvik manch par bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa pradhanmantri kii sabase mahatvapurn zimmedaariyon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister has the most important role in determining the global policy of the Indian state, due to his immense control over the government and the Council of Ministers
 desh kii videsh niti se sambandhit nirnay, desh kii samrik, kootnithik, aarthik, vanijyik ityadi aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar aamtaur par mantriparishad main charchaa dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati he, jiname antim nirnay pradhanmantri lete hai
 The Ministry of External Affairs of India handles global relations and related matters, for which an independent cabinet minister is also appointed in the name of the foreign minister, but because foreign policies, etc
, the Prime Minister determines, therefore, the Foreign Minister is ultimately decided by the Prime Minister
 Implements the decisions and policies taken
 vibhinn deshon se samrik, aarthik, kootnithik, vanijyik or sansadhanik, ityadi sandhiyaan or samjhaute, tathaa unase judi kootnithik bahes or vaartaon main pradhanmantri kaa kirdaar sabase mahatvapurn hota he, or aisi vaartaon main ve desh kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 It is also the responsibility of the Prime Minister to welcome and host the Heads of State and Delegations of various countries
 videshi pratinidhiyon kii mezbaani ke alawa, pradhanmantri, janpratinidhi va shashanpramukh hone ke naate, videshon main bharat kaa pratinidhitiv bhi karte hai
 He represents India in international organizations such as United Nations, G20, BRICS, SAARC, non-aligned Movement, Commonwealth, etc
, and stands for India
 antarrashtriya manch par desh kii chhavi banane, or kootnithik vaartaon dwaara desh ke hit kii aapurti karne main pradhanmantri kaa sthaan behad mahatvapurn he
 The Constitution of India, being the head of the national head and all strategic forces, gives the President of India the right to declare war and peace from any other country, but its real authority lies with the Prime Minister, because according to the advice of the Prime Minister in this matter Are bound to work yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke alaava, yuddh kii ranneeti nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa samrik balon ko niyantrit karnaa bhi pradhanmantri dwaara hi hota he tathaa shanti-ghoshnaa karnaa or shanti-samjhauta karnaa bhi pradhanmantri kaa karttavya he
 There are some special, sensitive and high-level departments and ministries of the Government of India, which are not assigned to any minister other than the Prime Minister due to their specialty, sensitivity or any other reason
 in vibhinn vibhaagon ke kaaryon ke prati ve sansad ko javabdeh he, or aavashyaktaa padane par unhen sansad main puche gaye prashno kaa uttar dena padataa he
 Generally, the Prime Minister is in charge of these following departments: bharat ke pradhanmantripad ke rajnatik mahatva evam uske padaadhikari kii jananaayak or rashtriya netritvkarta kii chhavi ke lihaaz se, pradhanmantri pad ke padaadhikari se yah aashaa kii jaati he, ki ve bharat ke janamanas ko bhalee-bhanti jane, samajhen evam raashtra ko uchit disha pradaan karen

 Prominent among these duties is the Prime Minister's address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi every year on the occasion of Independence Day

 tatpashchaat, unke dwaara shuru kii gayi is parampara ko unke prayek uttaradhikari ne barkaar rakhaa he, or yah parampara aaj tak chali aa rahi he
 At the present time, the Prime Minister's speech is considered one of the most important political events of the year, in which the Prime Minister himself directly presents to the public the achievements and mood of the government
 15 agast ke bhaashan ke alaava, prativarsh, 26 janvari ko ganatantraa diwas ke din, rajpath par ganatantraa diwas ke samaaroh kii prarambh se purv, pradhanmantri, desh ke taraf se, amar jawan jyoti par pushpamala arpit kar, bhartiya suraksha balon ke shahid sainikon ko shradhanjali arpit karte he

 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 The lionesses were daughters of India, Bela and Kalyani, who killed Gauri's Kazi in Ghazni
 ￼ Do you know, Naradham Narpishach Jehadi Ghori had taken Prithviraj Chauhan's daughter Bela and Jaychand's granddaughter Kalyani to Ghazni from India
 darasal jab naradham jehadi gori hamaare hindustan main jihad failaakar evam lut-khasot kar jab vah apane vatan gazani gaya to wo apane saath bahut sari hindu ladakiyon or mahilaon ke saath-saath bela or kalyani ko bhi le gaya tha!asal main bela hindu samraat prithviraj chouhan kii beti or kalyani jayachand kii pautri thi!dhyaan dene kii baat he ki jahaan prithviraj chouhan mahaan deshbhakt the, vahin jayachand ne desh ke saath gaddari kii thi lekin, uski pautri kalyani ek mahaan rashtrabhakt thi
 Well, when that Jehadi Ghori reached his Ghazni, his master "qazi Nizamulk" welcomed him very much and said to him, come Gauri, we are proud of you that you have conquered the name of Islam by conquering India! kaho sone kii chidiya hindustan ke kitne par katar kar laae ho! On this Jehadi Ghori smiled crookedly and said, 'qazi sir! i serve gold coins from India by robbing gold coins worth seventy crores dirhams, fifty lakhs four hundred mana gold and silver, in addition, valuable jewelery, pearls, diamonds, emeralds, brocade garments and dhukas
 i have brought 'kaaji :'bahut acha! lekin vahaan ke logon ko kuch deen-imaan kaa paath padhaayaa yaa nahin?'gori :'bahut se log islam main dikshit ho gaye hai
 ' kaaji : 'or bandiyon kaa kya kiya?'gori : 'bandiyon ko gulam banaakar gazani laayaa gaya he or, ab to gazani main bandiyon kii saarvajanik bikri kii ja rahi he
 Traders from the countries of Raunnahar, Iraq, Khorasan etc

 ek-ek gulam do-do yaa teen-teen dirham main bik rahaa he
 'qazi:' What did the temples of Hindustan do? 'ghori:' The temples have been looted and brought 17000 thousand gold and silver idols, more than two thousand precious stones idols and Shivling have also been brought and many places of worship are given to naphtha
 And has been burnt to the ground by fire
 kaaji

'ye to tumne bahut hi rahamat kaa kaam kiya he!'phir mand-mand muskaan ke saath badbadaaya 'gore or kaale dhani or nirdhan gulam banane ke prasang main sabhi bhartiya ek ho gayi hai
 Those who were considered prestigious in India, today they are enslaved to minor shopkeepers in Ghazni
 'phir thodaa rukkar kaha : 'lekin hamaare liye koi khaas tohfa laae ho yaa nahin?'gori : 'laayaa hum naa kaaji sahab! 'kazi:' What! 'ghori:' Bela, daughter of Sundar Jaichand's daughter Kalyani and Prithviraj Chauhan, even from the bones of Jannat
 'kaaji :'to phir der kis baat kii he? 'gori:' Just by your gesture
 'kaaji :'maasha allaah! aaj hi khilaa do naa hamaare haram main naye gul
 'ghori:' Insha Allah! 'or tatpashchaat, kaaji kii ijaajat pate hi shahbuddin gauri ne kalyani or bela ko kaaji ke haram main pahunchaa diya
 Whereupon, seeing the marvelous beauty of Kalyani and Bella, Kazi was taken aback and felt that the nymphs had come from heaven
 tathaa, us kaaji ne usne donon rajkumariyon se vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa to bela boli-'kaaji sahab! aapaki begmein bananaa to hamaari khushkismati hogi, lekin hamaari do sharten hai!'kaaji :'kaho

kaho kya sharten hai tumhaari! i am ready to accept any condition for hurts like you
 bela : 'pehali shart se to yah he ki shaadi hone tak hamen apavitra na kiya jaae kya aapako manjuur he?'kaaji : 'hamen manjuur he! duusari shart kaa bakhaan karo
 'bella:' It is our practice that the wedding clothes of the boy for the girl and the girl for the boy come from here
 atah, duulhe kaa joda or jode kii rakam ham bharat bhoomi se mangavaana chaahati hai
 'kazi:' i accept both of your conditions
 'or phir bela or kalyani ne kavichand ke naam ek rahasyamayi khat likhakar bharat bhoomi se shaadi kaa joda mangava liya or, kaaji ke saath unke nikaah kaa din nishchit ho gaya saath hi, rahamat jhil ke kinare banaaye gaye nae mahal main vivaah kii taiyaari shuru hui
 On the day of Nikah, he came to the Qazi Saheb marriage pavilion wearing the clothes sent by Naradham Kazi Kavi Chand and, Kalyani and Bella also wore clothes given by Kazi
 is nikaah ke bare main sabko itani utsukata ho gai thi ki shaadi ko dekhne ke liye baahar janata kii bheed ikatthi ho gayi thi
 But then Bela said to the Qazi Sahib - 'our dear Sartaj, we want to give darshan to the public before reading kalma and nikah, because we have a practice of giving darshan to the public before marriage and then to the Ghajini Also know that you are getting married to the most beautiful women of Jannat in old age
 or, shaadi ke baad to hamen jivan bhar burka pahananaa hi he, tab hamaari sundarataa kaa hona na ke baraabar hi hoga kyonki nakaab main chhipi hui sundarataa bhala tab kis kaam kii
 'yes, yes, why not
 'kaaji ne uttar diya or kalyani or bela ke saath rajmahal ke kangure par gaya, lekin vahaan pahunchate-pahunchate hi us ""naradham jehadi"" kaaji ke daahine kandhe se aag kii lapten nikalne lagi, kyonki kyonki kavichand ne bela or kalyani kaa rahasyamayi patr samajhakar bade tikshn vish main sane hue kapade bheje the
 In this way he "" Naradham Jehadi "" started running here and there like crazy from the flame of Qazi poison, then Bella told him - 'you only provoked Gauri to attack India, that is why, we conspired to kill you
 He has avenged his country by plundering it
 ham hindu kumariyaan hai or, kisi naradham main itani saahas nahin he ki wo jite ji hamaare sharir ko haath bhi laga de
 Kalyani said, 'unbecoming! You are very religious, and in the name of beating the jihad drum, you rob people and oppress the people living in peace, tho! Damn you
 'itnaa kahkar un donon balikaon ne mahal kii chat ke bilkul kinare khadi hokar ek-duusari kii chaati main vish buji kataar jor se bhonk di or unke pranhin deh us unchi chat se neeche ludhak gayi
 On the other hand, due to the effect of that poison, "" Naradham Jehadi "" Kazi madly running away and wandering around, the dog died in the agony
 is tarah bharat kii in donon bahadur sanatani betiyon ne videshi dharti paradheen rahete hue bhi balidaan kii jis gaatha kaa nirmaan kiya, vah saraahne yogya he or, aaj sara bharat in betiyon ke balidaan ko shraddha ke saath yaad karata he
 Salutations to such Hindu enthusiasts! In today's scenario, while love jihad is at its peak, if even a few hundred of our Hindu women xxrep 5 
 instead of surrendering to those love jihadis, Bella and Kalyani would have acted with courage and courage
 Teach those jihadis a lesson! aaj kii betiyaan bela or kalyani jaisi nahin ban rahi he ye dukh kaa vishay he, bharat kii betiyaan to sherniyaan thi Jaipur Express 12973 is a mail express train operated by Indian Railways

 nagvanshi We have seen that Sudas was associated with the Bharata caste, which in the long run, he was called a caste! The name of both Divodas and his son Sudas has a "slave" at the end indicating that they belonged to the Das or Nag dynasty! For each Nago, the slave name became the name of their species! The description of Naga dynasty is full of Vedas and Puranas! There is a long history of how the word Shiva became associated with the Nago! People of the Bharata dynasty used to worship Shiva, because of wearing the Shiva lingam, they started to be called Nag, Bharasiva! The people of the same Bharashiv dynasty were trained all over the name! While explaining the meaning of the word Bharsiva, Dr
 Kashiprasad Jaiswal says that the Vindhyachal region has good evidence of proving Bharhut, Bharadewal, Nagod and Nagdeya Bharo to be Bharashiv! Mirzapur, Allahabad and its adjoining areas have been the states of Bharo! In this way the entire Sanskrit name is Bharasiva! This era is called Kushan-yuga! When there were rulers of Rae Bareli, they were ambitious to establish the kingdom
 Bharshiva was not a caste name but his title! Bharshiva was a symbol of unity of Vindashakti! Starting from the first half of the third century, there was a kingdom of Nagvanshis over North India and Central India
 Initially, the Naga dynasty was here in Mathura and Gwalior, but gradually it gradually expanded to Vidarbha, Bundelkhand
 It is believed that all the people were mainly talking in two groups! One is Shivbhar and the other is Rajbhar
 The work of Shibbharo was not separate from Rajasata whereas the work of Rajbhar was to establish governance by running the rule! Choose Rajbhar Pravarsen as their leader! After eating the smell of holy water of Ganga, both of them united and later called "bharashib"! Desperate ruins, mounds and temple stupas of Bharshibo, his worker's past is still alive! The worship of shiva-parvati is a strong example of his temple! The word Kalgana, which originated from the Bharshiva Naga dynasty, is represented from the third or fourth century! Bhavnag is considered to be the strongest ruler of the Bharshiva dynasty! The word Bhar is made up of the Bharata caste! Saying this sentence in such a way that the whole word is made from Bharashiva Nago! There is no historical difference! Dr
 Kashi Prasad Jaiswal has added a period of 115 AD in Indian history called the Bharshiva period and in this way a new chapter has been added in history! nadimi tiruvuru main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke krishna jile kaa ek gaanv he

 umr unase kuran maangane lage magar unhone manaa kar diya
 Omar became angry and started killing them both
 magar unki bahan ne kaha ham mar jaaenge lekin islam nahin chodenge
 Omar felt ashamed to see the blood dripping from his sister's face and realized the mistake
 kaha ki main kuran padhanaa chahta hoon, isko apamaanit nahin karuunga vaayada kiya
 When Omar read the Quran, he said that it is the declaration of God that no human being can be created
 ek chamatkaar kii tarah se umr kuran ke satya ko grahan kar liya tathaa mohammad sahab se milane gayi
 Muhammad Sahab was very happy when Omar entered Islam
 musalamaanon khushi kii lahar daud gai umr ke islam laane par
 Omar announced that now everyone will study together in the Namaz Kabe, which no one could have imagined earlier
 umr islam ke shatru the parantu ab vah islam ke sarankshak ban gayi
 Seeing Omar in Islam created a furore among Muhammad's enemies
 ab islam ko umr naam kii ek tej talwaar mil gai thi jisase sara makka tharrata tha
 The Meccans hurled their sobs at the weak Muslims, upon which Muhammad sahab prayed to Allah, then Allah ordered him to go to Medina
 saare musalmaan chhupakar madeene kii taraf hizrat yani pravaas karne lage
 But Omar was very courageous, took his sword, took a bow and shot, reached near the Kaaba and did a tawaaf, read two rakat hymns and then said "who wants to make his mother cry on himself, orphan his children and widow his wife
" Meet the place
 " kisi kaa saahas nahin hua ki umr ko roke
 Omar declared his obeisance
 madina islam kaa ek nayaa kendra ban chukaa tha
 Sun Hijri created the Islamic calendar which is called the Almanac of Islam
 624 i main musalamaanon ko badr kii jang ladanaa padaa jisamen hazarat umr ne bhi aham kirdaar nibhaayaa
 In the battle of Badr, Muslims were defeated and the Musharis of Mecca were defeated
 badr kii jang ke ek saal baad makka vaale ekajute ho kar madeene pe hamalaa karne aa gaye, jang uhud naamak pahari ke paas hui
 In the beginning of the war, the Muslim army was heavy but due to some reasons the Muslims were defeated
 kuch logon ne afvaah uda di ki mohammad sahab shahid kar diye gayi to bahut se muslim ghabara gaye, umr ne bhi talwaar phenk di tathaa kehane lage ab jeena bekaar he
 After some time i came to know that this is a rumor and then stood again
 iske baad khandak kii jang main saath-saath rahe
 Omar led the Muslim army and finally Mecca also conquered
 iske baad bhi kai jangon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, umr ne un sabhi jango main netratav kiya
 On 8 June 632, Muhammad Sahib said goodbye to the world
 umr tathaa kuch log ye vishwaas hi naa rakhte the ki mohammad sahab kii mutyu bhi ho sakati he
 On hearing this news, Umar lost his senses, took out his sword and started saying loudly that i will separate his head from the person who said that the prophet has died
 is najuk maukey par tabhi hazarat abu bakr ne musalamaanon ko ek khutaba arthath bhaashan diya jo bahut mashhoor he: Then read the verse of the Quran: hazarat abu bakr se sunakar tamaam log gash khaakar gir gayi, umr bhi apane ghutanon ke bal gir gayi tathaa is bahut baden du:kha ko sweekaar kar liya
 When Hazrat Abu Bakr felt that his time was near, he chose Hazrat Umar for the next Khalifa
 umr unki asaadhaaran ichha shakti, buddhi, raajnneetik, nishpakshta, nyaay or garibon or vanchiton logon ke liye dekhbhaal ke liye acchhee tarah se jane jate the
 Hazrat Abu Bakr was fully aware of Omar's power and his ability to succeed
 umr kaa uttaradhikaar is prakaar ke rup main dusron ke kisi bhi rup main pareshaani nahin tha
 Hazrat Abu Bakr wrote his will to Hazrat Usman before his death that Omar would be his successor
 agast, san 634 i main hazarat abu bakr kii mrityu ho gai
 Omar became the Caliph and a new phase began

 After all, who will be the person who does not want to come to this holy land and will not want to show himself to Shri Bankebihari Ji
 yah mandir shri vrindavan dham ke ek sundar ilaake main sthit he
 It is said that this temple was built around the year 1921 with the collective efforts of the descendants of Swami Shri Haridas ji
 mandir nirmaan ke shuruuaat main kisi daan-daata kaa dhan isamen nahin lagaaya gaya
 Shriharidas Swami was a nostalgic Vaishnava subject
 unke bhajan–kirthan se prasann ho nidhivan se shri bankebihariji prakat huye the
 Swami Haridas ji was born in the village of Rajapur near Vrindavan on the eighth day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada month in Samvat 1536
 inke aradhyadev shyaam–saloni surat baale shribankebihari ji the
 His father's name was Gangadhar and mother's name was Mrs
 Chitra Devi
 haridas ji, swami aashudhir dev ji ke shishy the
 On seeing this, Ashudhir Devji knew that he is the incarnation of Sakhi Lalitaji and on the day of Radhaashtami, the devotion of Bhakti Pradhani Shri Radha ji's festival of Mangal Mahotsav is here for the benefit
 haridasji ko rasanidhi sakhi kaa avatar mana gaya he
 He used to be bored with the world since childhood
 kishoravastha main inhone aashudhir ji se yugal mantra diksha lee tathaa yamuna sameep nikunj main ekaant sthaan par jaakar dhyaan-magn rahane lage
 When he was 25 years old, he received illusions from his Guru and away from the world, was left to contemplate Nikunj Bihari's daily pastimes
 nikunj van main hi swami haridasji ko bihariji kii murti nikaalane kaa swapnadesh hua tha
 Then according to his ignorance, Shree Vigraha, having the image of Manohar Shyamvarna, was taken out of the lap
 yahi sundar murti jag main shribankebihari ji ke naam se vikhyath hui yah murti margshirsh, shukla ke panchami tithi ko nikaala gaya tha
 Therefore, we treat Prakatya Tithi as Vihara Panchami with great enthusiasm

 Then when the construction of the temple was completed, then they were brought there and installed
 sanay vansh paramparaagat shrikrishna yeti ji, bihari ji ke bhoga evam anya seva vyavastha sambhaale rahe
 Then he appointed Hargulal Seth ji in Samvat 1975 to take care of the service system of Sribihari ji
 tab is seth ne veri, kolkata, rohtak, ityadi sthanon par shribankebihari treston kii sthapana kii
 Apart from this, the cooperation of other devotees is also helping in this
 anand kaa vishay he ki jab kaala pahaad ke utpaat kii ashanka se anekon vigrah sthaanantarit hue
 But Sribankevihari did not transfer from here
 aaj bhi unki yahaan prem sahit puja chal rahi hai
 Later, by changing Swami Haridas ji's worship system, a new sect, independent of the Nimbarka sect, became a Sakhibhava sect
 isi paddati anusaar vrindavan ke sabhi mandiron main seva evam mahotsav aadi manaaye jate hai
 Shri Sreebakebihari ji is ordained in the temple of Shri Sreebakebihari only on the day of Sharad Purnima

 One morning Swamiji started seeing that someone was sleeping on his bed with a quilt
 yah dekhakar swami ji bole– are mere bistar par koun so rahaa hai
 Sreebihari ji himself was sleeping there
 shabd sunate hi bihari ji nikal bhaage
 But they left their chudas and wanshi on the bed
 swami ji, vruddh avasthaa main drushti jeern hone ke kaaran unakon kuch najar nahin aay
 After this, when the priest of Shri Bankebihariji temple opened the doors of the temple, when the priest of Shri Bankevihariji temple opened the doors of the temple, he could not see the sarcasm and wiggle in the face of shribankebihari Ji
 kintu mandir kaa darwaja band tha
 Surprised, the priest came to Swamiji at Nidhivan and told Swamiji all the things
 swami ji bole ki praatavkaal koi mere panlag par soya hua tha
 He has left something while leaving
 tab pujari ji ne pratyaksh dekha ki panlag par shribankebihari ji kii chuda–vanshi virajman hai
 This proves that Sribankebihari ji goes to Nidivan to do raas at night
 isi kaaran se praatah shribihari ji kii mangala–aarti nahin hoti hai
 Reason- Bihari ji comes here after night
 atah praatah shayan main baadha daalkar unki aarti karnaa aparaadh hai
 Many emperors used to come here to get the darshan of Swami Haridas ji
 ek baar dilli ke samraat akbar, swami ji ke darshan hetu yahan aaye the
 The darshan of Thakur ji is from 9 am to 12 noon and from 6 pm to 9 pm
 vishesh tithi uplakshyanusaar samay ke parivartan kar diya jaataa hai
 There are many stories in relation to the philosophy of Sribakebihari Ji
 jinamein se ek tathaa do nimnlikhit hai– ek baar ek bhaktimati ne apane pati ko bahut anunay–vinay ke pashchaat vrindavan jane ke liye raji kiya
 Both came to Vrindavan to see Sribakebihari ji
 kuch din shribihari ji ke darshan karne ke pashchaat uske pati ne jab swagrih waapas lautne ki cheshtaa kii to bhaktimati ne shribihari ji darshan laabh se vanchit hona padegaa, aisa sochakar wo rone lagi
 The world will go to heaven for bondage, so she starts crying near Sribihari ji, "O Lord, i am going home, but you stay with me forever, after praying, both of them will go towards the railway station
" Sitting in a horse cart walked
 us samay shribankevihari ji ek gop balak kaa rup dhaaran kar ghodagadee ke peeche aakar unako saath lekar le jane ke liye bhaktimati se prarthana karne lage
 Here, the priest not knowing Thakur ji in the temple, he came to know about the love incident of Bhaktimati and immediately he ran behind the horse cart
 gaadi main balak rupi shribankebihari ji se prarthana karne lage
 While having such a conversation between the two, that child disappeared from their midst
 tab pujari ji mandir lautakar pun shribankebihari ji ke darshan karne lage
 Here, both the devotee and Bhaktimati, knowing the kindness of Sribakebihari himself, both gave up their movement of the world and dedicated their lives at the feet of Sribakebihari
 aise hi anekon kaaran se shribankebihari ji ke jhalak darshan arthath jhaanki darshan hote hai
 There is a curtain on the front door of the temple Shri Sibihari and that curtain is closed and opened at an interval of two minutes and there is another legend
 ek baar ek bhakt dekhtaa rahaa ki uski bhakthi ke vasheebhoot hokar shribankebihari ji bhaag gayi
 When the priest opened the doors of the temple, he did not see shribankebihari
 pataa chalaa ki ve apane ek bhakt kii gavaahi dene aligarh chale gayi hai
 Since then it has been made such a rule that the curtain of Thakur ji will be opened and closed in Jhalak Darshan
 aisi hi bahut sari kahaniyaan prachlit he
 Sribakebihari Ji appeared from Swami Haridasji from Visakha Kund located in Nidivan
