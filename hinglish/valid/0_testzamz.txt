 koi bhi samooh bina netritv ke aastitvaheen hota he
 In the industrial sector, the owner or employee selects the leader
 hona yah chahie ki maalik or karmchaaree donon milakar netaa kaa chunaav karen
 This type of ideal selection system can prevent small conflicts between the owner and the employee
 isse samasyaon kaa samaadhaan bhi jaldi ho saktaa he
 The person chosen by the owners and managers is more possessive and may neglect the interests of the employees
 iske vipareet karmchaariyon dwaara chunaa vyakti karmchaariyon ke prati uttaradaayi hota he
 Thus the policy conflict begins to escalate
 isliye prabhaavshaalee netritv ke liye aavashyak he ki maalik or karmchaaree donon milakar yogya, anbhavi or vyavhaar kushal vyakti ko netaa chune
 Leadership is divided into three categories at three levels- pratham str ke prabandh main ucch shrenee ke big bos, madhyam str main keval bos tathaa teesri shrenee main forman yaa suparvizer aate he
 These three types of leaders work at different levels
 inke uttardaayitv va karttavya bhi bhinn hote he
 The leader needs to be able to maintain relations on each side of his group in order to continue in his position
 isliye sucharu kaary ke liye yah aavashyak hota he ki netaa apane samooh ke karmchaariyon se hameshaa nikat ke sambandh banaae rakhen, isse netaa or karmchaariyon ke bich tanaav kii sthiti nahin aegi or na hi koi anya samasyaayein utpaadan ko prabhavit karengi
 In every work of the factory, the principal work depends on the employees
 karmchaaree hi kaary sanchaalan kii mahatvapurn ikai hota he
 Regardless of whether or not you are technically trained, the first phase of production begins
 karmchaaree ke baad suparvizer phir kaary kii pravriti ke anuroop vibhinn prakaar ke ek upar ek adhikari hote hai
 The officer has many functions
 adhikari kaary kaa sucharu rup se sanchaalan, karmchaaree kii jimmedaariyaan, utpaadan kii maatra, uskaa gun aadi pakshon ko dekhtaa he
 On the other hand, he instructs the employees from time to time, keeps control over them, settles their mutual quarrels, listens carefully to their proper and unreasonable demands and falls in the work area of the work officer on which every officer should Time has to be ready
 yadi aisa na hua to vyavastha main bhang ho jaati hai
 Due to which production, employees and managers are affected by it
 karmchaariyon ke kaary ke nirikshan hetu suparvizer netaa hote hai
 For production it is necessary that employees make adjustments with their work
 karmchaariyon kaa yah samaayojan adhikariyon or unki shashan pranali par nirbhar karata he
 Disorganization in industries such as strike, lockout, mutual relations between employees and managers, etc
 are the aspects which are related to misunderstanding of employees and managers
 lekin jo pramukh kaaran he vah he buddhiheen netritv
 Leadership is the only option that maintains balance in functioning
 is prakaar kaa netritv adhikari varg karata he isliye adhikari yaa prabandhak ko netaa kii sangya di jaati he
 Among the employees who get salary and other facilities in the industry, there are many employees who work whole heartedly
 jabaki kai karmchaaree aise bhi hote hai jo kaary main baadha daalate hai
 Similar employees create problems for the leader
 aise karmchaariyon se vyaavhaarik taratamya bana lenaa hi netritv kii visheshtaayen or shilgun hai
 Officers should stay in contact with employees, treating them as a unit in the industry
 isse aapasi matbhed, ghrinaa, dwesh aadi ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 An employee is also an elite person like officers, he also has his own reputation
 adhikari aisa vyavhaar na kare jisase karmchaaree yah mahasoos kare ki use alag samajha ja rahaa he yaa usase dabaab purvak kaary liya ja rahaa he
 The officer should keep in mind that the employee also has his own desires
 ve udyog main ek mahaan shakti ke rup main hai
 It is this organization that plays an important role in the well-being and growth of the industry
 isliye adhikariyon va maalikon ko is sanghathan ke liye achche vichaar rakhane chahie jisase sanghathan ke andar buree bhavanaaen paidaa na hon
 The employees going to the opposite should be given the right guidance, organize a seminar in their midst and give the right direction to their thoughts
 karmchaariyon ke hit kii baat adhikariyon ko sochni chahie tathaa unki uchit maangon ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 Demands of employees are related to salary, dividend etc
 apni chikitsa or nivas sambandhi maangon ko bhi ve mahatv dete hai
 He also talks about socio-economic development but causes chaos in the industry
 tod-phod, anshan, hadtaal aadi silsilaa chalata rahata he
 Managers, owners and executives have to play an important role only in such odd circumstances
 karmchaaree kii vrittiyon tathaa maangon ko gambheertha se lenaa chahie
 It should be remembered that along with the increase in price, the demand for dearness allowance is also reasonable
 aisi paristhitiyon main adhikariyon ko chahie ki ve karmchaariyon ke saath vichaar goshtee rakhen or aapasi vichaar-vimarsh dwaara ek-duusare ko samajhen tathaa samjhaute ke dwaara samasya kaa hal nikaalen
 Always take the right approach
 adhikariyon kii yogyata evam gun isi baat kaa parichaalak he ki ve najadik se ek-duusare ko samajhen
 In the industry, there are supervisors or inspectors to look after the work of the employee, these inspectors are called leaders
 nirikshakon kii visheshtaayen or saumy vyavhaar is baat par nirbhar karata he ki kaarkaane kii nitiyaan kis tarah kii hai
 These policies are created by the managers
 nitiyaan is prakaar kii honi chahie jisase karmchaariyon main vishwaas kii bhaavana jaage
 The inspector is responsible for making these policies work, so it is necessary that in the choice of inspectors in the factory, their honesty, sympathy, dedication to work and all good qualities are given importance
 yogya nireekshak hi karmchaariyon or kaary ke bich santulan sthapit kar saktaa he
 Practical and tolerant inspectors leave a special mark on employees
 ve icchaanusaar karmchaariyon se kaary karwaane main safal hote hai
 It is not necessary that the inspector be more intelligent but it is necessary that the inspector should be tactful, the inspector should be trained
 yadi nireekshak prashikshit hota he to karmchaariyon se samaayojan sthapit karne main aasaani hoti he
 Hence the appointment post inspector should be trained
 prashikshit or anbhavi nireekshak ek kushal netaa hi nahin varan vah kathin paristhitiyon main bhi samasya kaa samaadhaan kir saktaa he
 Such an efficient democratic leader does not allow his reputation to come forward in the time of agreement or disunity with the employees
 vah apane sanvegon par niyantran karata he or nishpaksh vyavhaar karata he
 Gives importance to gentle, honest and hardworking employees, protects those employees from harassment
 karmchaariyon ko adhik se adhik suvidhaayen pradaan karata he tathaa Craig and Charts consider a successful leader to have the following qualities: blem ne paanch siddhaton kaa varnan kiya he
 According to him, the successful leader should work under the following five principles - is sandarbh main blem ek safal netaa ke liye aise kaary na karne ke liye nirdesh dete hai jisase karmchaaree or netaa ke bich duuri bani rahe
 Those tasks are- ek janatantric netaa ke nimna kaary hai- Paying attention to problems- The leader should pay attention to the problems of the employee, this does not create a situation of frustration in the employee
 yadi unki samasyaon ko najrandaaj kiya jaataa he yaa unhen dabaane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he to karmchaaree par iskaa vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Therefore, their problems should be properly discussed
 samuhik baithak - netaa ko karmchaariyon ke saath main samuhik baithak kaa aayojan karnaa chahie
 In which the views of employees should be listened carefully and give their suggestions
 karmchaariyon ko samuhik kaary karne kii prerana deni chahie
 The problems of employees should be exchanged by sitting in a group
 nishchit uddeshy kii jaankaree dena - karmchaariyon ko unke samooh ke uddeshy kii bhaleebhanti jaankaree deni chahie
 At the same time it is also necessary that in the means to reach the objective, how should be adopted by the Jan Tantrik leader
 isse karmchaaree ko lakshya prapti ke liye uchit kaaryon kii jaankaree ho jaati he
 Determining the parameters of efficiency - The democratic leader should set and introduce the standards of efficiency of the employees
 uchit nirnay - netaa ko chahie ki vah uchit nirnay le or karmchaariyon ko bhi ve nirnay maanya hon
 If the working class expresses doubt in the decisions, then they should also tell that they can resolve their doubts in the group meeting
 prerana dena - karmchaaree ko is baat kaa abhas karnaa chahie ki uski kathin mehnat, eemaandaaree aadi se utpaadan par vishesh prabhaav padataa he
 This leads to progress of the organization
 jisamen karmchaariyon kii hi pragati he
 It is the job of a democratic leader to discuss giving special reward, economic dividend, promotion etc
 to the employees for this progress
 isse karmchaaree ko ek prakaar kii raahat milti he, vah kaary ke prati utsahit hota he
 The success of the leader in the industry depends on the incorporation of some basic rules in his behavior
 isse karmchaaree or netaa ke bich santulan bana rahata he
 Some rules are as follows- samasyaon ko dhairyapurvak sunanaa- karmchaariyon kii apni samasyaayein hoti hai jinhen netaa ke sammukh rakhte hai
 In such a situation, if the leader gets excited then the employee is not able to tell his point completely
 isse karmchaaree hatotsahit ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the employee should not interrupt or stop while talking
 isse karmchaaree ke man main upeksha kaa bhav paidaa hota he
 In contrast, the employee should listen calmly and calmly
 isse karmchaaree kaa vishwaas apane netaa ke prati bana rahata he
 They do not even disregard the leader
 soch samajhakar nirnay lenaa - netaa ko chahie ki vah koi bhi nirnay lene main jaldbaaji na kare
 Thoughtful decision does not become a hindrance
 isse kai samasyaon ko uchit tareeke se suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Do not discourage employees - If the leader discourages employees, then it will definitely have an impact in the industry
 karmchaariyon ko samay-samay par utsahit karnaa chahie taaki karmchaaree apane kaary ke prati jaagruk rah saken
 Even if the employee brings his problem, he should not be reprimanded
 varan unka manobal badhanaa chahie
 The leader should be the least sensitive and sensitive - in the industry, often the leader faces similar and odd situations
 yadi netaa in paristhitiyon main hi apane ko samahit kar le to vah udyog ke liye acha nahin hoga
 The leader's complaint is mostly emotional
 aise main yadi netaa swayan par niyantran na rakhkar karmchaariyon ke saath samvegpurn dhang se vyavhaar kare to samasya or bhi ulajh sakati he
 Conversely, employees can take advantage of this even if they are more sensitive than necessary
 isliye netaa ko vivekpurna vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 The leaders themselves are avoiding debate - it is often seen that debate creates disharmony
 isliye netaa ko karmchaariyon ke saath vaad-vivaad se bachanaa chahie
 Employees also feel insecure due to more debate
 karmchaariyon ko aagyaaen di ja sakati hai
 They should not attempt to impose them, which makes the employee feel an additional burden
 karmchaariyon kii prashansa karnaa- karmchaaree udyog main apni mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa karata he
 The leader should praise him when the time comes
 prashansa sabake saamne ho
 This makes the employee feel happy
 uskaa manobal isse badhata he
 He starts his work with hard work and dedication
 iske vipareet yadi karmchaaree kii buraaiyon ko sabake saamne kaha jaay to karmchaaree kii sthiti tanaavpurn hogi
 It will have an impact on the industry
 isliye netaa karmchaaree kii buraaiyon ko ekaant main kahe isse karmchaaree kaa ahm surakshit rahata he
 a psychologist named Howzer designed a questionnaire to understand the psychology of the authorities
 isse yah jaanane kaa prayaas kiya gaya ki adhikari jo ki audyogic vaataavaran se ghire rahete hai or jinka karmchaariyon se sidhaa sampark rahata he to unki manodasha kya hogi? yah prashnawali is prakaar he- Many similar questions were created
 in prashnon se jo uttar saamne aae unka vishleshan karne par nimna jaankaree praapt hui- This article is translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Leadership
 ateet main, kuch shodhakartaaon ne tark diya he ki sanghathanaatmak parinaamon par netaaon kaa vaastavik prabhaav ahamkaari he or netaaon kii pakshpaati visheshtaon ke parinamswaroop vah aupnyasik ho gaya he 
 in daavon ke baavjood, yah kaaphi had tak manyata praapt he or abhyaasakarta or shodhakartaaon dwaara sweekaar kiye jate hai
 They believe that leadership is important and research holds that leaders contribute by contributing to important organizational outcomes
 Understanding and measuring leadership performance is necessary to facilitate successful performance
 kaary pradarshan aamtaur par us vyavhaar ko darshata he jo sanghathanaatmak safalataa main yogadan detaa he
 Campbell identified specific types of performance dimensions, one of which is the leadership dimension
 netritv pradarshan kii koi nishchit or samgr paribhaasha nahin he
 There are many specific assumptions in leadership of leadership performance, such as - effectiveness of leader, progress of leader, emergence of leader
 Leadership performance, for example, is used for the success of an individual leader, the performance of a group or organization, or the emergence of a leader
 inamen se prayek upaay kii dharna alag he
 While these aspects may be related to each other, their results may differ and their inclusion depends on the application / research focus
 ek sanghathan jo saadhan ke rup main sthapit he yaa paribhaashit uddeshyon ko praapt karne ke liye gathit he to use aupchaarik sanghathan kaha ja saktaa he
 The sample specifies how to categorize and specify the goals in an organization as reflected in the organization's subdivisions
 prabhaagon, vibhaagon, virgon, sthiti, rojgaar or kaary, kamsanrachana banaate he
 Thus, a formal organization must deal with clients or its members impersonally
 According to Weber's definition, admission and subsequent progress is by merit or seniority
 prayek karmchaaree ek vetan praapt karata he or kaarykaal kaa ek degree hasil karata he jo varishton yaa shaktishaalee graahakon kaa manamaane prabhaav se nigaraanee karata he
 His perceived expertise in accomplishing low-level work of an organization as it would in a hierarchy may arise when solving problems
 yah ek naukarshahi sanrachana he jo sanghathan main prashasnic prabhaagon ke pramukhon kii niyukti ke liye aadhaar hota he or apane praadhikaron se juda rahata he
 Unlike a designated administrative head or head of a unit, a leader emerges from an informal organization located under a formal organization
 anaupchaarik sanghathan vyaktigat sadsyta ke nijee uddeshy auralakshya ko vyakt karata he
 Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with the formal organization
 anaupchaarik sanghathan ek viksit saamaajik dhaanchon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he jo praayah maanav jivan main achaanak udbhoot hone vaale samoohon or sanghathanon ke samaan udbhav hote hai or apane aap main hi samaapt ho jate hai
 In prehistoric times, man was busy with his personal safety, maintenance, protection and sustenance
 ab aadmi apane jivan kaa ek bada hissaa sanghathanon ke liye kaam karne main bitaata he
 His desire to identify a community that provides him with protection, protection, maintenance, and a sense of belonging has remained unchanged since prehistoric times
 yah jarurat anaupchaarik sanghathan or isaki, aakasmik yaa anadhikrut, netaaon ke dwaara puri hoti he
 Leaders emerge from within the framework of an informal organization
 unke vyaktigat gun, sthiti kii maang, yaa in donon kaa sangyojan or anya pahalu anuyaayiyon ko aakarshith karte hai jo ek yaa kai uparishayi sanrachanaon main unke netritv ko sweekaar karte hai
 Appointed by a head or president, a contingent leader wields influence and power, rather than his authority
 prabhaav ek vyakti kii kshamta he jo dusron ke sahyog, anunay or puraskaar par niyantran ke madhyam se hasil kiya jaataa he
 a right is a strong law of influence because it controls a person's ability, punishment by his actions
 netaa ek aisa aadmi he jo ek vishisht parinaam ke prati logon ke ek samooh ko prabhavit karata he
 It does not depend on authority or formal authority
 
 netaaon kii pahchaan, anya logon kii dekhbhaal ke liye unki kshamta, spasht sanchaar or ek patibaddhta se hoti he
 a person who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to allow and he enforces his position of authority
 uske adhikaron se mail khaati huin uski paryaapt vyaktigat visheshtaayen honi chahie, kyonki adhikaar se hi usame sakriyata hoti he
 In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager who can challenge the role played by an emergency leader in his organization is less often faced than his perceived chieftain
 baharhaal, pad kaa adhikaar aupchaarik pratibandhon kaa samarthan karata he
 It seems that whoever holds an individual position or authority justly acquires a formal position in the hierarchy, correspondingly authoritatively
 netritv kii paribhaasha duusare logon kii icchaanusaar chalaane kii kshamta he
 Every organization needs leaders at every level
 anek varshon se prabandhan or netritv kaa sambandh itane nikat kaa rahaa he ki aam taur par log un ko ek duusare kaa paryaay maanane lage hai
 However, it is not the case that good managers have leadership skills and good leaders have good managerial qualities
 man main is vichaar ke saath, netritv ko is rup main dekha ja saktaa he: Any traditional style called bipolar that applies to management also applies to the leadership style
 hersey or balaanchard is drushtikon kaa upyog karte hai : unka daawa he ki prabandhan netritv vyapaar kii sthitiyon se purna hota he
 In other words, management is a different form of the broader leadership process
 ve kehete hai ki : "netritv tab hota he jab koi vyakti kisi bhi samay yaa asamay, bina kisi kaaran ke kisi ek vyakti yaa samooh ke vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Management is a type of leadership in which the achievement of organizational goals is paramount
 " warren bennis or daan goldsmith ke anusaar ek acha prabandhak sab kaary thik karata he 
 ek netaa sahi kaary karata he
 However, a clear distinction between management and leadership may also prove useful
 yah netritv or prabandhan ke bich parsparik sambandhon kii anumati detaa he, ek prabhavi prabandhak main netritv kaushal hone chahie or ek prabhavi netaa main prabandhan kaushal hone chahie
 ek spasht antar nimnlikhit paribhaasha pradaan kar saktaa he: Abraham Zalejnik, has illustrated the differences between leadership and management
 usne netaaon ko preranadai doordarshee kaha he jo ttatv ke bare main chintit rahete hai jabaki prabandhak achche niojak hai jo prakriyaaon ko lekar chintit rahete he
 Warren Bennis has expanded directives between managers and leaders
 unhone donon ke bich baarah bhed bataae hai : Paul Birch also explains the difference between leadership and management
 ve kehete hai ki ek vyapak saamanyakaran ke rup main prabandhak kaaryon ke saath sambandh rakhte hai jabaki netaa logon ke saath sambandh rakhte hai
 Birch did not suggest that leaders focus on "work
" Indeed, the things that make a leader great highlight the fact that they achieve them
 prabhavi netaa rachana karte hai, use kaayam rakhte hai, laagat netritv kii prapti, rajasav netritv, samay netritv, bazaar mulya netritv ke madhyam se pratiyogi laabh ko banaae rakhte hai
 Managers generally realize the leader's vision and follow him
 antar itnaa hi he ki netaa kaary kii uplabdhi, sadbhaavna or dusron ke samarthan ke madhyam se praapt karte hai jabaki prabandhak aise nahin karte he
 This goodwill and support arises in the leader by looking at people as individuals, not by looking at them as a resource
 The manager often organizes resources to get something done
 in sansadhano main log pramukh he or kharaab prabandhak logon ko ek or vinimay vastu ke rup main dekhte he
 a leader plays the role of guiding others so that they can complete a task by focusing a vision
 Often people see the work as subordinate to philosophy
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek sanghathan samgr kaary ko purna kar laabh dekhtaa he par ek acha netaa laabh ko ek up-utpaadan ke rup main dekhtaa hai jo uske utpaada kii drushti se pravaahit hote hai, taaki unki company pratiyogita se alag rahe
 Leadership manifests itself not only as a business event but as a whole
 bahut se log ek preranadayak netaa ke bare main soch sakate hai jinka kaarobaar se koi lenaa dena nahin he : ek raajnneetijna, sashastr balon kaa adhikari, ek scout guide yaa netaa, ek shikshak, aadi
 isi prakaar prabandhan keval vishuddh kaarobaar ghatana nahin he
 Then we can see here a few examples of people who cater to the niche of non-business organizations in management
 avyapaarik sanghathan bina paison ke prerana dene vaali drushti ko samarthan detaa he
 However, many times this does not occur
 petricia pichar ne netaaon or prabandhakon ke vargeekaran ko chunauti di he
 He used a factor analysis technique on data collected over 8 years
 ve is tathy par pahaunchin ki netaa teen prakaar ke hote hai : harek netaa alag manovaigyanik ruparekha liye hue hote hai : kalakaar sampann hote hai, shilpkaar hote hai, takaneekajna hota he
 He said that the outline of any person is not sufficient for the leadership style
 agar ham ek netaa bananaa chaahate hai to ek 'kalakaar netaa' ko bananaa chahie, agar ham sthiti ko majboot karnaa chaahate he to ek 'shilpkaar netaa' ko bananaa chahie, agar hamaare paas ek badsoorat naukari he jise hame jakadi ke dwaara jaldi karnaa he to ek 'takaneekajna netaa' ko khojna hoga
pichar ne yah bhi kaha he ki ek santulit netaa bahut mushkil se milte he, kisi bhi netaa main ye sabhi teen abhas he, unke apane adhyayan kaal main unhen koi bhi aisa nahin mila
 Bruce Linn exposes the facts between 'leadership' and 'management'
 vishesh rup se, "ek netaa avasar ko ubhaar kar lete hai, ek prabandhak nakaaratmak jokhimon ko kam karata chalata he
 "he said that a successful executive has to maintain a complete balance in the enterprise and its context
 bina prabandhan ke netritv ke kadam aage nahin badhate hai, lekin bina prabandhan ke netritv ko kuch kadam peeche le jaati he
 Leadership without management goes backward, but does not advance
 vyaktigat netritv ke bajaay, kuch sanghathanon ne samooh netritv ko apanaaya he
 In this case, more than one person provides direction to the group
 kuch sanghathanon ne ise is ummid se apanaaya he, taaki ve rachanaatmakataa main baadha kar saken, laagat ko kam kar saken or aakaar ko kam kar saken
kuch log paaramparik netritv ko dekhte hai jisamen ek samooh pradarshan ke samay maalik par bahut adhik laagaat aati he
 In some situations, maintenance of the owner also becomes expensive - either exhausting all resources as a group or inadvertently shattering the creativity of the entire team
 udhaaharan ke liye ek samooh ke netritv main kai kaary sanlagn hote hai
 a team full of diverse skills gather from all parts of the organization to lead a project
 ek dal kii sanrachana samaan rup se adhikaron ko sabhi muddon par saajhedaar ke rup main detii he, aamtaur par yah netritv badalte hue chalata he 
is dal ke sadsy pariyojna ke kisi bhi charan ko sambhaal sakate hai
 According to Ogbonnia, "effective leadership has so much potential that they successfully integrate and make maximum use of available resources and achieve organizational or social goals
" ogbonia ke anusaar ek prabhavi netaa vah vyakti he jo apni kshamta se lagaataar safalataa hasil karte hue kisi bhi paristhiti main ek baithak or sanghathan kii apekshaaon ko purna karata he
 In addition, because every person from each team is given opportunities, they experience a higher level of empowerment and empowers their employee to succeed
 jis netaa main lagan, dridhtaa, drudh sankalp or achche sanchaar kaushal hai vah apane samooh main bhi inhen gunon ko ubhar kar le aate hai
 Good leaders use their inner qualities to bring success to their parties and organizations
 richard vrangham ourdel petersan, nerakshasi nar main : vanar or mul maanav main hinsa maujuud hone kaa saboot dete hai, ve kehete hai kiprithvi par rahane vaale anyajanwaron kii tulana main keval manushya or chimpanzeeyon ke bich saamaan vyavhaar hote hai, hinsa, pradeshikta or desh ke liye ek pramukh ke rup main siddh karne ke liye pratiyogita hoti rahati he

 It would be beneficial if we examine all accounts of leadership from the last few millennia through the establishment of Christian literature in the perspective of a patriarchal society

 It is also important to note that the peculiarities of one tribe are not notable to others, as do the customs of our modern times also change

 However, not all scientists agree that Bonobo has a peaceful nature or a reputation as a "hippie chimp"

 Neuralgia, psychosis or neurasthenia is a state of physical and mental fatigue in which a person experiences continuous fatigue and loss of strength
 hindi main ise 'tantrikavsaad' bhi kehete hai
 The main causes of neuralgia are excessive physical exertion, prolonged emotional stress, mental exertion and anxiety etc

 Nalinji was a learned scholar of Sanskrit, Hindi and English
 saath hi french evam german bhashaa kaa bhi unhone yathesht gyaan praapt kiya tha
 He also had a keen interest in painting
 nalin ji ne hindi aalochana kaa nayaa maapdand nirmit kiya
 Through his sharp critical articles, literary commentaries and book reviews, he succeeded in reviving the Hindi world
 naye-puraane sabhi lekhakon ke bich ke aalochak ke rup main ve samaan rup se pratishthit the
 His choice of old literature was as important as it was about new literature
 unki likhit aalochana pustakon kii sankhya bahut adhik nahin he
 During his lifetime, two criticism books were published titled 'darshan' and 'history of Literature Darshan'
 maranoparant unki teen aalochana pustaken- 'maandand', 'hindi upanyaas : visheshtah premchand', tathaa 'sahitya: tatva or aalochana' ast-vyast dhang se prakashit huin
 Apart from these, Nalin ji was also an excellent storyteller of distinctive style
 unki kahaniyon ke do sangrah prakashit hai -- ' vish ke daant' tathaa 'satraa asangruhit purv choti kahaniyaan' 
 There are also two compilations of his poems - 'nakane Ke Prapadya' and 'nakane-2'
 unhone anek pustakon kaa sampaadan bhi kiya
 With reference to the stories of Nalin ji, Nishtaketu ji wrote that "nalin Vilochan Sharma did the experiment and miracle in Hindi through these two collections of 'teeth of poison' and 'seventeen unorganized pre-stories' in Manto Urdu, Catherine Mansfield In English and Balzac together in French
 sharma ji ne yon-vityuti, vikruti dansh, sookshm manovigyaan or prachhann virechan-darshan kaa kahaniyon main jaisaa swarupan kiya he; vah vastutah anyatam he
 Few stories in Hindi will be acclaimed on such a level of language and such a level of craft
 " Reflecting on Nalinji in relatively detail, often in thirty pages of his book 'development of Hindi Criticism', Nandkishore Nawal Ji has described him as completely orthodox and politely by choosing the same words which seem to support Rupadism
 They have destroyed their ideology
 naval ji ke is vistrut vivechan main ek vaakya bhi nalin ji ke prati puri tarah sakaaratmak nahin he
 It is surprising that when Nalin ji is such an accomplishment-zero critic, why has Nawal ji thought it prudent to show him the 'development' of his Hindi criticism in the book 'committed'! is pariprekshya main nalin ji kaa mahatv jaanane ke liye yah anivarytah dhyatavya he ki ve vichaar yaa drushtikon ke virdohi nahin the balki use hi rachana kaa nirnaayak tatva na maanakar use bhi rachana ke sanghatak tattvon main se hi ek maanate the
 Many proofs of this are available in his critical works
 aaj rup-vaishishty ke kaaran hi anek marxvaadi aalochak bhi agyeya kii bahuvidh prashansa kar rahe hai or unke suprasiddh upanyaas 'shekhar : ek jeevani' ko to praayah ek swar se hindi ke sarvshereshth upanyaason main ek maan liya gaya he, tab is sandarbh main nalin ji ke vichaaron ko dekhnaa or bhi mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 Nalin ji has considered 'shekhar: a biography' unique in Hindi from the point of view of style, and has also dismissed it from the list of best from ideological point of view
 jis sthapaty par sarvaadhik jor dene ke kaaran nalin ji ko rupavaadi mana gaya he uske sambandh main unka spasht kathan he ki " sthapaty kaa vaastavik mahatva tabhi he, jab vah chitraneey vastu ke liye anivaary parinaam ho, kintu saath-hi-saath vishisht drushtikon kaa kaaran bhi ban sake
 "that is why, according to Premchand's mature approach in Godan, he considers the architecture of Godan as mature / perfect
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki yadi premachand godaan main do bhinn saamaajik virgon kaa is tarah samaanaantar sangyojan nahin karte to vah drushtikon bhi sahi rup main abhivyakt nahin ho saktaa tha
 That is why they also consider architecture as a causative element
 apane in vichaaron ke kaaran nalin ji ne godaan hi nahin balki pragatishiltaa ke stambh niraala tathaa mailaa anchal ke saath-saath banbhatta kii aatmakatha ke mahatva ko bhi pahachaanaa or sabase pehle pahachaanaa, balki spasht udghoshnaa kii
 This means that Nalinji in Hindi literature also adopted the appearance of fashion, because of the content being spread like infectious disease, he was strongly against declaring forward or backward, successful or unsuccessful and required proper adjustment of the constituent elements of the composition
 Due to acceptance, they used to give extra emphasis on architecture

 Bacteria and microorganisms were first observed by Antoine von Leuvenhock in 1676 with a single-lens microscope
 aisa karke unhone jeev vigyaan ke kshetra main ek abhootpurv kaary kiya jiske dwaara jeevanu vigyaan va sookshmjaiviki kaa armbh hua

 Woodrow Wilson woodro wilson america ke 28 wein raashtrapati the
 Wilson is known as an academic scholar, administrator, historian, jurist and politician who explained the functions of public administration
 woodro wilson kaa janm 28 disambar 1856 ko america ke varjeenia praant main hua tha
 He graduated from Princeton University in 1879, studying politics, administration and law
 princeton vishvavidhyalay se hi 1886 main wilson ne piech
 di
 kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 His first work was published by the Congress Government in 1884
 wilson 1886 se lekar 1902 tak raajnneeti vigyaan ke professor rahe
 During the period from 1902 to 1910, he held the post of President of Princeton University
 wilson ko 1910 main new jersey rajya kaa governor chunaa gaya
 In 1912 Wilson was elected the 28th President of the United States
 ve 8 varshon tak america ke raashtrapati ke pad rahane ke baad sevanivrutt ho gayi
 In 1919 Wilson received the Nobel Prize for Peace
 1924 main mastishk aghat se unka nidhan ho gaya
 Woodrow Wilson would not have even dreamed that he would one day become President of the United States
 bahut kam aise log hai jo is pad par raajnneetik aparipakvatapurna vyaktitv se pahunche honge
 But after becoming President no one would have acted with as much perseverance, prudence, nation-building efficiency and duty-devotion as Wilson, the Messiah of Peace
 ek bhavishyadrushtataa or adarshavaadi hote hue bhi vah linkan ke baad sabase acha adhik yathartwaadee or nipun raajnneetik netaa tha
 But no one knew in 1913 that Wilson would become a great man
 koi nahin jaanata tha ki wilson dwaara sanyukt rajya america ko pratham vishwayuddh main bhaag na lene ke sabhi prayatnon ke baavjood bhi us raashtra ko yuddh main nirnaayak bhaag lenaa hoga
 Nobody knew that he would go beyond the Atlantic to try to give permanent peace to the world, and his efforts would be destroyed at the altar of selfishness and domestic petty opposition by some European politicians
 kisi america raashtrapati ne apane hi aadarshon evam yojanaon ko apane hi logon dwaara nirdayatapurvak nirast evam parajeet hote hue nahin dekha hoga
 Wilson was a professor of political science
 atev vah chintak tha
 He wrote extensive texts on American administration
 uskaa vichaar tha ki karypalika evam vyavasthapika main shakti ke bantwaare se shashan main saamanjasy nahin ho paaya
 Therefore, he wished that the American President should be as powerful as the Prime Minister of England
 jab vah raashtrapati bana to usne nihsandeh apane vichaaron ko karyanvit kar raashtrapati kii shashan kaa shaktishaalee kendra-bindu banaaya
 There was bold boldness in it, a senseless sincerity
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki satvik kaaryon kii sadaiv vijay hogi or satya ke pratinidhiyon ko asaty, avivek evam aadambar se samjhauta nahin karnaa chaiye
 In the early years of his reign, he attracted the attention of the entire public
 usne sampoorn rashtriya jivan main samarpan, tyaag evam naitikta kii bhaavana ko prerit kiya
 But he became so proud of himself for his sattvikta and purposes that he started thinking that those who opposed him were opposing God
 usamen linkan kii vinamrata kaa abhaav tha
 In his election campaign, he gave the slogan of Progressivism, abandoning the conservative views of the past
 raashtrapati banane ke baad usne apane vyaktitv main samjhautavaadi jivan grahan nahin kiya, haalanki raashtrapati pad ke namakan ke liye usne us bryan kii bhi bahut prashansa kii thi jiske sambandh main uski dharna yah thi ki ‘use kachare main phank dena chahie
 In fact, his personality was a combination of many qualities
 vah khushaamad pasandagi kii evam vinamr ghoosekhori kii kala se parichit tha, lekin saath hi vah gahari naitikta, dayaa evam samvedansheel vritti kaa bhi tha
 He used to identify good and bad
 usamen ‘purv vimaan’, plato ke ‘darshanik raja’ evam maikiyavali ke ‘rajkumaar’ ke tattvon kaa samavesh tha
 Like Lincoln, he proved worthy of his responsibility over time
 wilson shaanti ke rajnay main vishwaas karata tha, matbhedon ko vaarta ke rajnay dwaara sulajhane kaa pakshdhar tha
 He was idealistic
 jab duusari baar vah raashtrapati chunaa gaya tab use is baat kii gambheer chintaa thi ki vishwa kii tanaavpurn sthiti ko dekhte hue america ko tatasthta ke paaydaan par nahin rakhaa ja saktaa tha
 Wilson was an advocate of peace
 vah acchhee tarah jaanata tha ki vishwa yuddh main america pradesh se amarikiyon kii vichaardhaara, darshan evam sahitya par yupriyata kaa baari prabhaav padegaa
 Wilson presented the American proposals for peace, which were rejected by the European powers
 america ne tatasthta kii ghoshnaa kii
 On 4 September 1914, in his diplomatic reference to the Congress, Wilson said- "this situation is not created by us but it is in front of us
" yah hamen pratyaksh rup se prabhavit karti he maano ham un paristhitiyon ke bhagidaar hai jinhone ise janm diya he
 We will pay for it even though we have not intentionally given birth to it
 “ america mahayuddh se achoota nahin rah saktaa tha phir bhi 1914 main koi america nahin jaanata tha ki unhen yuddh main sanlagn hona padegaa
 When Germany's u-boats started an uncontrolled war, America, the last powerful neutral country against Germany, entered the war
 wilson ne 2 april 1917 ko congress ko apana prasiddh sandesh bheja, jisamen usne apane desh ko salaah di ki yah yuddh main pravesh kare or vishwa ko loktantreey shaktiyon kii raksha kare
 In the said message, he said, "we will definitely fight for the principles we want from the heart
 ham loktantr kii raksha karenge
 We will protect the rights of those who respect a just authority and thus want some rights in their governance by remaining disciplined
 ham sabhi chote deshon or rashtron ke adhikaron or swatantrataaon kii aavashyak raksha karenge
 We would like to ensure that free people throughout the world have just and free freedom, so that peace and security can be maintained in all countries and thus the whole world will be free
 aaj america ke saubhaahgya se vah din aa gaya he jabaki hamaare naagarik apana rakt or apni shakti un siddhanton kii raksharth vyay karenge jinke aadhaar par america kaa janm hua tha, jinke aadhaar par america ko sukh or samruddhi praapt hui thi tathaa vah amuly shaanti praapt hui jise vah atyant mahatv kii drushti se dekhtaa aayaa he
 " shantipriy wilson vivash tha
 It was a matter of great importance for America's future that he had found such a person as President who transformed the basis of this war into a 'noun of salvation and reform'
 17 janvari 1917 ke bhaashan kaa ek ansh uski sampoorn maanavtaa ke prati samvedansheel vichaaron ko abhivyakt karata he-”bina kisi paksh kii vijay ke shaanti, prayek jati ke liye aatm-nirnay kaa siddhanth, samuhik, swatantrata, astr-shastron kaa parisemen, uljhane vaali sandhiyon kaa unmoolan tathaa akraman kii roak ke liye samuhik sangrakshan kii vyavastha
 "on April 2, Wilson appeared in front of the nation's highest representative congress and asked for permission to declare war
 ”is mahaan shantipurna janata ko yuddh kii ore-jo sabase adhik bhayanak or vidhvansak yuddh he
 
taking is a terrible thing
 sabhyataa swayan bhi sankat ke palade main jhul rahi he kintu nyaay shaanti kii apeksha moolyawaan he ore ham aisi vastuon ke liye ladenge jo hamen atyadhik priy rahi hai
 For democracy, for the rights of the people who believe in the rule that they should be heard in their own government, for the rights and freedom of the small nations, for the rule of the world by the organizations that bring peace to all nations and Provide security and finally the world can become independent
 aise hi lok kaary ko apana jivan or apana sarvasv samarpit kar sakate hai
 With the campaign that the day has come, America's placenta blood and power should be spent for the principles that have given her birth and peace, which she has protected, that is, if God is pleased Can't do anything else
 “ After the war, whether Wilson had suffered defeat and whether it was bitterly criticized by nominal realists, his speech was a turning point in American history and politics
 unke hriday se nikalne vaale shabd itane maarmik the ki sara raashtra uski aawaaj par taanaashaahee par prajatantra kii barbarta par sabhyataa kii vijay ke liye yuddh main kud padaa
 In the countries across the seas, he not only appeared as a unique great man, but also came to be recognized as the leader of a powerful nation, who descended to protect a peaceful, pleasant and orderly life in the world
 nevins evam comajor ke shabdon main- ” 'shakti adhikadhik shakti, shakti bina kisi rukaawat yaa seemaa ke' yah vachan rashtradhyaksh wilson ne diya tha or raashtra hathvadita ko thopane main safalataa praapt kii
 Immediately worked to fulfill this promise
 iske purv kii kisi sarkaar ne yuddh main isse adhik budhimaani ore kaaryakshmata nahin dikhalaai thi
 Even before this, the Americans did not show such vigor, resourcefulness and invented intelligence
 “ ‘bina vijay kii shanti’ yuddh kaa naaraa ban gaya tha
 After the cease-fire treaty, Wilson, who did not listen to the advice of his secretary, reached the Paris Peace Conference in December 1918, he was welcomed as the 'messiah of Peace'
 europe main us samay yah bhaavana vidyaman thi ki keval wilson hi aisa vyakti he jo vibhinn rashtron ke raag-dwesh or unki irshyaa-bhaavana se upar uthaa hua evam maanavtaa kaa rakshak he
 Therefore, when this philosopher king took the booklet of his principles in his hand, armed with military power, came to set the terms of the treaty, the people of Europe opened his heart in his honor
 sabhi deshon main uskaa abhootpurv swaagat hua
 When he reached Paris, the French were delighted to see him
 sadakon par apaar jan-samooh ne uski stuti kii or akhabaaron ne uske gungan kiye
 In fact, everyone's eyes were on him
 vijayi nyaay kii, vijit dayaa kii or saamaanya jan-shakti kii aashaa karte the
 Wilson came to this conference as a lamp of peace
 vah nahin chahta tha ki paris sammelan 1815 ke vienna congress jaise nihit swaarthon kaa garh ban jaye
 But he could not guess that the conquering nations had a vestige of selfishness and if he had taken into account other facts, he would have escaped the trap or deception in which he himself got badly entangled due to his idealism
 uske pavitra uddeshy vijeta rashtron kii satta-pipaasa ke aage bhasmasaat ho gayi
 Wilson presented his ideas as the famous 14 sutras
 uske 14 sutron main pratham sutara yahi tha ki shaanti ke samjhaute saarvajanik rup se kiye jaayengen, koi gupt samjhauta nahin hoga
 These principles were also appreciated by the politicians of the Allies
 unke paas yudhottar samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye uparokt siddhanton ke atirikt or kya tha ? or parajeet rashtron ne bhi in siddhanton ke prati apni sahmati prakat kii parantu aadarshon evam siddhanton kii antatah shakti-poojak rashtron ke saamne kuch na chal saki
 The conference was also dominated by nationalist ideas, personal interests, which were predominant in the Vienna Congress
 france kaa klemency or england kaa loyad donon ne hi wilson par apni hathvadita ko thopane main safalataa praapt kii
 RB Mobat wrote in 'european Diplomacy' that "clemenceau used to repeat this sentence in the morning - i will support the establishment of the League of Nations"
 “ kintu italy ke orlando se jab ek baar poocha gaya ki rashtrasang ke bare main aapkaa kya mat he to uttar diya tha ki ”ham nihsandeh rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa swaagat karenge kintu fum kaa prashn tay kiya janaa chaiye
 "wilson was alone in the entire conference
 vienna congress ke pashchaat europe main is prakaar itane vishaal paimaane par vishwa str kaa koi sammelan nahin hua tha
 This former professor of political philosophy at Princeton was a talented orator and idealist thinker
 vah kathor vishwaason kaa vyakti tha jisamen raajnneetik doordarshita to ucch koti kii thi, lekin itani kootnithik yogyata nahin thi ki vah anya pratinidhiyon ko parajeet rashtron ke saath udaar vyavhaar ke liye taiyaar kar sake
 In the words of Stanard Baker, "whoever saw him working, never dared to dare to blasphemy before Wilson or behind his back
" “ wilson kaa yah vishwaas tha ki rashtrasang kii sthapana se hi maanav jati kii raksha ho sakati he, atah vah ise sab shaanti-sandhiyon kaa anivaary ang bananaa chahta tha
 But he was not mentally as sharp as Lloyd George and Clemenceau and relied exclusively on his pre-determined ideas, so he proved to be a novice in the field of diplomacy and political bargaining
 uske adarshavaad or rashtrasang kii sthapana ke atyadhik utsaah kaa duusare deshon ne puraa laabh uthaaya
 For other nations to accept the creation of the League of Nations, Wilson was willing to give up everything, even for the League of Nations he agreed to disregard many of the principles of his 14 sources
 paal bardsal ke kathananusaar vah kshatipurti kii samasya ke atirikt anya sabhi prashnon par britain, france or japan se rashtrasang ke naam par praayah apni adhikansh baaten manwaane main safal hua
 The Chinese state should have been found by the Chinese people on the basis of Wilson's theory of self-determination, but Wilson decided to give it to Japan with the desire to get the support of other superpowers to establish the League of Nations
 yah nirnay swayammev wilson dwaara apane siddhanton par kutharaghaat tha
 Nevertheless, if a little leniency was dealt to the defeated at the Paris Conference, it was because of Wilson
 isamen koi sandeh nahin tha ki yadi wilson sammelan main na hota to loyad jorge or klemenso na jane kya se kya kar dete
 Wilson continued to curb his infinite aspirations
 yadi wilson na hota to france germany kaa namonishaan mitaakar hi dam letaa
 Wilson had two objectives
 pratham nyaaypurna samjhauta jiske anusaar aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth par rashtron kii simaaon kaa nirdhaaran ho taaki paraspar shaanti sthapit ho sake
 Second, the establishment of the League of Nations
 pehle uddeshy main vah safal nahin hua kyonki jo shaanti kii gai vah thopi hui shaanti thi na ki aatm-nirnay ke aadhaar par yaa samjhauta-vaarta kii shaanti
 But he succeeded in the second objective
 rashtron ke sangh kaa vichaar moulik nahin tha or kai deshon main kai logon ne is vichaar ko spasht karne main yogadan diya tha, kintu jis rashtrasang kii antim rup se sthapana kii gai thi vah wilson kii hi sristi thi or uske aadarshon kaa mandir tha
 Some scholars think that Wilson himself made a huge mistake by coming to Paris
 yadi vah washington main rah kar hi american pratinidhiyon ko aadesh detaa rahata to bahut sambhav tha ki uskaa prabhaav adhik vyapak hota, par wilson ko sarvaadhik chintaa rashtrasang kii thi or uski abhilaashaa thi ki vishwa sanstha ke vidhaan kaa nirmaan vah swayan kare
 In fact, it was very unfortunate that while his presence at the conference was not beneficial to the conference itself, he could not even keep contact with the American public while away from his country, which resulted in the United Nations being nurtured by his own country
 Only rejected
 american seenet ne wilson ke rashtrasang kii sadsyta ke prastaav ko nahin mana
 In the 1918 congressional elections, the anti-wilson Republican Party won a majority in both houses of Congress, and the Senate revoked the League's consent to accept the Treaty of Legislature and Versailles
 yah maanavtaa ke ek mahaan paigambar kaa dukhamay paraabhav tha
 Woodrow Wilson believed that public administration should separate from politics
 unhen saamaanya taur par prashasan or raajnneeti main vibhaajan ko rekhaankit karne ke kaaran yaad kiya jaataa he
 According to Wilson, the composition of a constitution is easy but it is difficult to implement it
 unhone kriyanvayan ke kshetra ke adhyayan par vishesh bal diya
 In his essay Study of Administration, Wilson, while discussing the interrelationships of politics and administration, wrote that administration is outside the domain of politics
 prashasnic samasyaayen raajnneetik samasyaayen nahin hoti hai
 Although politics can determine the function and nature of administration, it should not be given the right to manipulate administrative aspects
 prashasan ko raajnneeti se swatantra karte hue woodro wilson ne use ek vishay ke rup main sthapit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 In 1968 in the field of administrative service, Sharda Prasad Verma was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India
