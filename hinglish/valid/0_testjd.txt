 Oxygen can be obtained by heating many types of oxides or dioxide and many salts containing oxygen
 jab kuch paraksaide pani ke saath prakriya karte hai tab bhi oxigen utpann hota he
 Therefore, a powdered mixture of sodium peroxide and manganese dioxide or lime chloride is used for oxygen production
 hypochloride athwa hypobromite ke vighatan se yaa gandhak ke amla tathaa manganeez diaksaide yaa potacium paramanganet kii kriya se bhi oxigen miltaa he
 Hydrogen peroxide is more suitable alone or with a catalyst to prepare small amounts of gase
 jab barium oxide ko tapt kiya jaataa he tab vah hawa se oxigen lekar paraksaide banaata he
 Oxygen is obtained from its dissolution at high temperatures and barium oxide remains for reuse
 audyogic utpaadan ke liye brin vidhi isi kriya par aadhaarit thi

 It is the most successful and most popular software of open source software or open source software
 yah jeepiel v 2 license ke antargat sarv saadhaaran ke upyog hetu uplabdh he or iskaa kuch bhaag unics se prerit he

 At that time, AT&T
 The company was a controlled monopoly so it could not sell computer software
 usne ise, sorce code ke saath, bina shart, sarkaar tathaa vishvavidhyalayon ko de diya, ve chaahe to usamen pherbadal kar sakate hai
 By the 1980s, Unix became the most popular, powerful, and stable operating system, although by that time it had undergone several modifications
 unics main ek kami thi - isko samajhnaa tathaa chalaanaa mushkil he
 Andrew Tenenbaum is a professor of computer science at Amsterdam
 unhone isaki sahaayta ke liye minix naam kaa program likhaa
 It also had some shortcomings
 linus torwald finland ke helsinki vishvavidhyalay main kamputer vigyaan ke chaatr the
 He wrote a program to overcome the shortage of Minix which was later called 'unix of Linus' or Linux for short
 iskaa sabase pehla kor yaa karanal unhone 1991 main internet main post kiya
 By then Richard Stallman's 'GNU' project had started
 linus torwald ne isse bahut saare program apane linaks main liye
 Hence Richard Stallman says
 ki ise 'gnew-linaks' kahana chaiye
 But this name could not work because of its long standing
 par iskaa arth yah nahin hai ki linaks kii safalataa main gnew project kaa haath nahin he
 Linux was not possible without the GNU project
 unics oparating system kii kalpana 1969 main sanyukt rajya america main anti and tii ke bel prayogshaalaon main ken thompsan, denis richi, duglas mexloyay or jo ossan dwaara kii gai thi or lagu kii gai thi
 Unix was first released in 1971, and was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time
 baad main, 1973 main ek pramukh agrani drushtikon main, ise denis richi dwaara kuch programing bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha 
 The availability of Unix's high-level language implementation made its porting to various computer platforms easy
 computer enterprise maamle main pravesh karne se pehle kisi antitrust maamle ke kaaran, anti and tii ko oparating system ke strot code ko kisi bhi vyakti ko license dene kii aavashyaktaa thi
 As a result, Unix grew quickly and was widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses
 1984 main, anti and tii ne bel labs ko khud ko vibhajit kar diya; ni: shulk licencing kii aavashyaktaa vaale kanoonee daayitv se mukt, bel labs ne unics ko malikana utpaada ke rup main bechnaa shuru kiya, jahaan upyogkartaaon ko kanoonee rup se unics ko sanshodhit karne kii anumati nahin thi
 The GNU project, started in 1983 by Richard Stolman, aimed to create a "complete Unix-compatible software system" made entirely of free software
 1 9 84 main kaam shuru hua
 Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and in 1989 wrote the GNU General Public License
 1990 ke dashak ke aarambh tak, ek oparating system main aavashyak kai kaarykram, text editors, unics shail, or ek windog system) puraa ho gaye the, haalanki divaais driver, damon or karnel, jinhen jienyu / hard kaha jaataa he, nimna str ke tatwon ko roak diya gaya tha or adhuraa tha
 Linus Torvalds has stated that if the GNU kernel was available at that time, he would not have decided to write his own
 miniks kaa nirmaan computer vigyaan ke professor andrew es tanembam ne kiya tha, or 1987 main chaatro or anya logon ko lakshith unics jaise oparating system ke rup main jari kiya gaya tha jo oparating system ke siddhanton ko siikhnaa chaahate the
 Although the entire source code of MINIX was freely available, licensing terms prevented it from being free software until licensing changed in April 2000
 linaks kaa koi bhi aphis nahin he, koi bhi company yaa vyakti iskaa maalik nahin he
 But programmers around the world contribute to it
 duniya ke itihaas main isse bada, is prakaar kaa aandolan, kabhi nahin hua
 That too started by a US student from outside university
 kyonki kamputer vigyaan main nayi dishaayein dikhaane kaa varchasv to keval america kaa tha
 Money cannot be used for Linux software, but this does not mean that it cannot be earned
 bahut sari companiyaan is par sarvice dekar paisa kama rahi hai or chal rahi hai
 The main ones are Red Hat and Sues
 linaks ke teen str hai - AT&T Had initially given Unix source code to the University of California, Barkley
 is vishvavidhyalay ne us par kaary kiya tathaa ise kaaphi aage badhaaya
 The university also derived its form which is famous as Barkley Souftower Distribution
 yah open sorce he
 AT&T The company disbanded in 1984 and part of it came with a computer job that the computer had the freedom to trade

 lekin uski kya sharte hai yah kisi ko maaloom nahin he
 At present, there are mainly five lawsuits related to Linux
 yah mukademen kyon chal rahe hai, iske bare main kai atakalein internet par hai
 The Caldera company previously used a distribution of Linux by the same name
 It was not very successful - at least not as much as Red Hat, Suce and Mandriva
 Caldara later went on to have a Santa Cruz operation

 linaks, linus torwald kaa trademark he or is samay linus torwald kii taraf se, linaks mark institute is naam ke prabandh kaa kaary dekhte hai
 In 1994, a person named Della Cross took the trademark to the US in the name of Linux
 usne linaks bechney vaali companiyon ko notice bhejne shuru kiye ki ve usase license le len
 Linus Torvald and companies related to Linux ran a case against him
 1997 May According to an agreement in this lawsuit, the trademark Linux name was given to Linus Torvald
 After that, Linus Torvald took the responsibility of managing the name LMI for the misuse of the Linux name
 Gave it to Lmi Linux gives the license to use the name
 Linus Torvald has also released a statement about this

 Computing means a feed aggregator, called a feed reader, news reader, or aggregator, is a desktop or web application that compiles syndicated drafts, such as news headlines, blogs, podcasts, and blogs, all in one place, on the Internet
 Displays it
 chunki is saamagree main badlaav yaa adhyatan hota rahata hai atah sankalak yani agrigater ko lagaatar masaude kii kshamal feed par nazar rakhni padati he
 In this article the word compiler is used for aggregator, but keep in mind that it is not a standard term
 jis sindicated masaude ko sankalak grahan karata he vah saamanytah aresas yaa anya kisi kshamal praaroop jaise ardf yaa atom main muhaiyaa karaayaa jaataa he
 The compiler saves the time and labor spent on locating new content on websites, and in a way makes it a personal newspaper for the reader to present
 ek baar kisi feed ko sabsakraib karne yaa niyamit pathak ban jane par sankalak prayogkarta kii icchaanusaar tay antaraal par nai saamagree kaa pataa lagaakar us tak saamagree pahunchaa detaa he
 This technique is called bridge technology
 yah email yaa instent miseging jaise sadhano main prayukt push taknalaji se thik ulat yukti he
 Also, with push technology, the compiler can easily unsubscribe from any feed as compared to the subscribers of the content, ie it can refuse to be a reader
 zyaadaatar sankalak prayokta ko uske yaa anya pathakon dwaara padhe ja rahe feed kii suchi opiemail praaroop main niryaat va aayaat karne kii suvidha bhi dete hai
 In many portal web sites, compilation is available on the website itself, such as My Yahoo or i Google
 yah suvidha aadhunik web brouzaron va email kaaryakramon par bhi uplabdh he
 The compiler encapsulates the draft and serves it on a single browser or desktop application
 in anuprayogon ko aresas reader, feed reader, feed agrigater, news reader yaa search agrigater bhi kaha jaataa he
 Compilers that have the capability of podcasting can also automatically download or download media files such as MP3 recording

 Recently some new compilers, also being called "RSS Narrator", have also come in the field which not only compile feed drafts but also allow them to listen as audio recording without being connected to internet
 jaal aadhaarit sankalak aise anuprayog hai jo duurastha sarwar par sthit hote hai or jinka google reader yaa blogalins jaise jaal anuprayogon ke sahare prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since these applications are used through the Internet, the user can read their subscribed feeds wherever Internet connectivity is available
 aadhunik sankalak ajaiks jaisi takneekon kaa prayog karte hai or anekon vijet ke rup main bhi uplabdh hai
 In addition to individual compilers, there are community compilers that usually compile feeds from a small community

 It is a type of multiphase system
 teen feji shakti ke anek laabh hai
 It was first practiced and patented by Nicola Tesla in 1887–1888
 teen phej pranali main teen taar main na hokar paraspar 120 degree kalantar par hoti hai
 These three are the same frequency
 kalantar se matlab yah he ki ye dharaaen alag-alag samay par apane adhiktam maan vaale bindu par hoti hai, ek hi samay par nahin
 That is, if the maximum point of the first current comes at 0 time, the second at t / 3 and the third at 2T / 3 time; Where is the period of alternating current
 teen feji pranali main ek chauthaa taar bhi ho saktaa he jise neutral taar kehete hai
 All the above properties are also possible in all systems with 3, 6, 9, 12 phase of which the three phase is the simplest
 adhikansh gharelu lod ekreeji hote hai 
 In most countries, three phased powers do not enter homes, but only one phase and neutral come in homes
 teen phejon ke liye praayah teen alag-alag rangon ke taron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Lala, yellow and blue are the symbols of these three phases in India
 neutral ko kaale rang se tathaa arth ko halake hare rang ke taar se liya jaataa he
 The three phases of an amount with three phases can be represented in the following form: yadi G1 = G2 = G3 to pranali ko 'santulit' kaha jataa he, anyathaa 'asantulit' 
 The following three-phase system consists of the art-sequence v 1 { \ displaystyle v_ {1}}, v 2 { \ displaystyle v_ {2}}, v 3 { \ displaystyle v_ {3}}, v 1 { \ displaystyle v_ {1 }},

 Changing the art sequence for some type of three fuzzy loads can cause a huge mess
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi 3-feji preran motor main phej-anukram badal diya jaay to vah pehle kii tulana main ulti disha main ghoomane lagegi
 It is important to change only one of the two phases to change the art sequence
 isi prakaar, teen phej se judaa koi power conwarter jisamen SCR laga ho bhi galat kaam kar saktaa he yaa kharaab ho saktaa he, yadi usko di jane vaali teen-feji vidyut kaa kala-anukram badal diya jaay
 But if the electronics of that power converter are intelligent, then even if the sequence of the art is changed, it will work properly and there will be no problem

 atev vedavyas kaa bhi samay isi ke anusaar nishchay karnaa hoga
 The author of the monksutra whom Panini has mentioned in his Ashtadhyayi is also the Ved Vyas who we also call Badarayana Vyasa and that is why it is also called Badarayana Sutra
 panini ke kaal ke sambandh main anek mat hote hue bhi goldstarak, vasudevasharan agarwal aadi vidwaanon ke anusaar yah lagbhag 6000 varsh isa se purv rahe honge, aisa kaha ja saktaa he

 haalaanki is baat par dabaav daalaa janaa chahie ki jis tareeke se babiloniyon ne pithogoras kii sankhyaon ko sambhala usase pataa chalata he ki ve jaanate the ki yah siddhant saamanytah sahi sabit hota he or ve kuch aise pramaanon ke bare main bhi jaanate the jinhen ab tak kunirup sroton main nahin khoja gaya he
 Because of the secretive nature of their school and its students dedicating everything to their teachers, there is no evidence that Pythagoras worked on it himself to prove the theorem
 us maamle ke liye, is baat ke koi pramaan nahin hai ki unhone kisi bhi ganitiya yaa para ganitiya samasyaon par kaam kiya
 Some believe it to be a myth carefully constructed by Plato's followers two centuries after Pythagoras' death
 mukhyatah plato kii para bhautikee ke maamle ko aadhyatmik tehraane ke liye, jo unke dwaara pithogoras ko samarpit vichaaron kaa saath thik prakaar se kaam karte the
 This imposition has been going on for centuries and has been associated with modern times
 pithogoras ke naam kaa is prameya se sambandh sthapit karne kaa sabase pehla ullekh unki mrityu ke paanch sadiyon ke baad sisarau or plutark ke lekhan main miltaa he
 Today Pythagoras is distinguished as a devotee by the Ahl al-tauheed or Druze faith, along with his followers, Greek Plato, but there were also critics of Pythagoras, such as Heraclitus, who said that "reading much learning does not bring wisdom; Otherwise it was taught to Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again to Xenophanes and Hecateus
 pithogoras kaa drushtikon dharmik or vaigyanik tha, unki najar main vigyaan or dharm ek dusre se sambandhit hai
 Religiously Pythagoras was a follower of the metempsychosis
 ve sthantar aagaman yaa aatma ke punar janm main vishwaas karte the, unka maananaa tha ki aatma jab tak sadaachari nahin ho jaati tab tak vah maanav, pashu, yaa subjiyon main baar baar avatar leti rahati he
 His idea of rebirth was influenced by ancient Greek religion
 vah pehle vyakti the jisane yah prastaavit kiya kii vichaar prakriya or aatma mashtishk main sthit he dil main nahin
 He himself remembered four lives in detail as he claimed to have lived and used to hear the cry of his dead friend crying as a dog barked
 pithogoras kaa ek vishwaas yah tha ki jivan kaa saar sankhya he
 In this way, the stability of all things forms the universe
 swasthya jaisi chijen tatwon ke ek sthir anupaat par nirbhar karti hai; kisi bhi cheez kaa bahut kam yaa bahut zyada hona ek asantulan kaa kaaran hota he jo kisi bhi jeev ko aswasth bana saktaa he
 He compared ideas to number calculations
 jab darshan lok siddhanton se jud jaataa he to vah vishwaas ban jaataa he, ki jivan ke saar kaa gyaan sankhyaon ke rup main khoja ja saktaa he
 If it is taken one step further, it can be said that because mathematics is an undiscovered essence, the essence of life is an undiscovered characteristic that can be encountered by studying mathematics
 pithogoras ke koi bhi lekhan nahin milte hai, haalaanki unke naam ke saath kuch jaali lekhan jude hai or inamen se vartmaan main bhi paae jate hai; ye puraatanta main prasaarit hue hai
 Complex ancient sources such as Aristotle and Aristogenus cast doubt on these writings
 pracheen pithogoriens ne aamtaur par apane swami ke vaakyanshon ko muhaavarey autose effe ke saath spasht kiya or apane shikshan kii multah maukhik prakruti par bal diya
 Pythagoras as the character of Ovid's last book in the Metamorphoses, where Ovid explains his philosophical outlook
 pithogoras ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he, "koi bhi aadmi mukt nahin he jo apane aap ko niyantrit nahin kar saktaa he
 " pithogoras kaa ek anya paksh bhi he, jisamen vah apane aitihaasik vyaktitv ke aas paas vistrut kinvadantiyon kaa ek vishay ban gaye
 Aristotle described Pythagoras as a supernatural being who performs miraculous acts, describing him in such an aspect as a Golden Thai, a symbol of divinity
 arestu or anya logon ke anusaar, kuch pracheen log maanate the ki unamem antariksh or samay se hokar yatra karne kii kshamta he or jaanwaron or podhon ke saath baat karne kii kshamta he
 "golden Thai" is an extract from the entry of Brewer's Dictionary of Frace and Fable
 aisa kaha jaataa tha ki pithogoras ke paas ek golden thai tha, jise usne aberis ko darshaya, jo uttardeshvasi pujari tha or usne olympic khelon main pradarshan kiya
 Another legend is drawn from Brewer's Dictionary
 vah unke chandramaa ke bare main varnan ko darshaati he
 Pythagoras believed that he could write on the moon
 unki yojana thi ki rakt main ek darpan par likhaa jaye or ise chaand ke saamne rakh diya jaye or jab chaand kii discs par shilaalekh pratibimbit hoga
 One of Pythagoras's main achievements was the discovery that music is based on a proportional interval of numbers from 1 to 4
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki sankhya pranali or isiilie brahmad pranali, in sankhyaon ke yoga par aadhaarit hoti he: das devataaon ke bajaay das yaa tetractis of di dekad ke dwaara pithogoras kii kasam
 Odd numbers were male and even numbers were female
 usne 3 se 5 jyamitiya thoson se nirmit, ganitiya anupaaton ke siddhanton kii khoj kii
 Hippasus, a member of his sequence, also discovered an proportional number, but the idea was not conceivable for Pythagoras, and according to legend Hippasus was executed
 pithogoras yaa ne varg sankhyaon kii bhi khoj kii
 He found that if for example, if four stones were taken and arranged as a square, then not only each arm is equal to the other arm, but if the two sides are multiplied by each other, they will arrange the square
 Is equal to the sum of the total number of stones in it
 isiilie ise "varg mul" kaha jaataa he
 He was one of the first to think that the Earth is round and all planets have an axis and that all planets revolve around a central point
 unhone kaha ki yah kendriya bindu prithvi he, lekin baad main kaha gaya ki yah kendriya bindu "agni" he jise unhone kabhi bhi surya ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa
 He also said that the moon is another planet that he called "counter Earth" —the latter believed in the limited — unlimited
 pithogoras yaa ek vyapak arth main pithogoriens ne plato ke kaam par ek mahatvapurn prabhaav daalaa
 According to RM Hare his influence consisted of three points: a) The Platonic Republic may be related to the ideas of "an organized community of like-minded people", as Pythagoras established in Croton
 ba) is baat ke pramaan hai ki sambhawatah plato ne pithogoras se yah vichaar liya ki ganit or saamaanya bhashaa, amoort soch darshanik soch ke liye ek surakshit aadhaar he, saath hi vigyaan or naitikta main paryaapt thisis ke liye bhi yaa aadhaar he
 C) Plato and Pythagoras presented the same idea in the "mystic approach to the soul and its place in the physical world"
 aisa lagata he ki donon orfism se prabhavit the
 Plato's ideas were clearly influenced by the work of Architas, an actual Pythagorean of the third generation, who made significant contributions to geometry, which is reflected in the Eighth Book of Elements of Euclid
 pracheen rome or numa pompilius kii kivdantiyon main rome kaa doosraa raja, pithogoras ke adheen adhyayan karata tha, aisa kaha jaataa he
 This is not likely because the two equally accepted dates for life do not impose
 pithogoras ne ek gupt samaaj kii sthapana kii jo pithogorian brotherhud kehalaati he yah ganit ke adhyayan ko samarpit thi
 This had a profound influence on future occult traditions, such as Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry, both groups devoted to the study of mathematics, both claiming to have developed from the Pythagorean Brotherhood
 pithogoras ke ganit ke rahasyamayi or gupt gunon kii charchaa menley pi haal ke adhyay di secret teachings of aal ages main kii gayi he jiskaa sheershak he "pithogorian methmatics "
 Pythagoras's theory later had a profound influence on numerology, which became very popular throughout the Middle East in the ancient world
 8 veen sadi ke muslim kemiagar jabir ebn hayaan ne vyapak sankhya vigyaan ke aadhaar par kaam kiya, vah pithogoras ke siddhant se bahut adhik prabhavit tha
 There is no primary source about Pythagoras
 yah lekh pithogoras kii shastreey vyakhya karata he jo baad ke lekhakon ke lekhon par aadhaarit he
 Since much of the information available is written after centuries of Pythagoras' life, his accuracy is uncertain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki praarambhik pithogorian kaa ganitiya mahatva atishyoktipurna he or pithogorian orfic yani gupt panthi the
 He had an influence on numerology, later serious mathematicians were born out of them when geometry became popular throughout Greece
