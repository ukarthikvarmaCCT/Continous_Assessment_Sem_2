 Then came the era of Amrish Puri moving away from the roles of villains to character actors
 or is daur main bhi unhone apni abhinay kala kaa jaadu kam nahin hone diya Amrish Puri acted in the biggest films of the century
 unke dwaara shahrukh khan kii hit film "dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge" main nibhaaye gaye "babuji" ke kirdaar kii prashansa sarvatra kii jaati he
 He is mainly seen playing the character of Villain in films
 1987 main bani anil kapur kii mistar india main unhone "mogambo" kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa jo ki film kaa mukhya khalanaayak he
 Amrish's dialogue "mogambo Khush Hua" in this film is famous in the film world
 damoh lok sabha nirvachan kshetra bharat ke madhya pradesh rajya kaa ek lok sabha nirvachan kshetra he
 Ammeter or 'ammometer' is a device used to measure the current flowing in a branch of a circuit
 bahut kam maatra vaali dhaaraon ko maapne ke liye prayukt yuktiyonko "milliametre" yaa "micrometre" kehete hai
 The earliest design of Ammeter was the d'arsonle's Dharmapi or the moving horoscope Dharmapi
 san 1820 i
 main ampiore ne avishkaar kiya ki yadi kisi chaalak ko, jisamen vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa jaae, to usapar ek bal kaary karata he
 The value of this force is equal to the product of the intensity of the magnetic field, the current and the length of the conductor
 is bal kii disha fleming ke baayein haath vaale niyam se gyaat kii jaati he
 Spread the thumb of your left hand, the finger near it and the middle finger of the middle in such a way that all three are perpendicular to each other
 yadi tarjani chumbakeey kshetra kii disha main or madhyamaa vidyutdhara kii disha main sanket karen, to chaalak kii gati anguthe kii disha main hogi
 When electric current flows in a coil placed in a magnetic field, a coaxial force acts on the coil, which it begins to rotate
 is siddhant ko kaam main laakar jo dharamapi banaae gaye, hai unhen chalkundal dharamapi kehete hai
 It consists of a rectangular coil with thin and electrified copper wire
 yah kundali phasphar branj kii bahut patali pattee dwaara ek pench se lataki rahati he, kundali kaa ek sira isi pattee se judaa rahata he or pattee kaa sambandh dharamapi ke e sanyojak pench se hota he
 The leaf also has a circular plane or concave mirror, which rotates along the leaf
 kundali kaa doosraa sira dhaatu kii ek sarpil kamaani se judaa rahata he, jiskaa sambandh duusare sanyojak pench se hota he
 This coil hangs between the poles of a powerful permanent umbilical magnet
 chumbak ke dhruv natodar belanaakaar akruti main kate rahete hai
 a soft iron small cylinder is enclosed in the back of the Dharmapi by a screw inside the coil between the two pole segments
 ye sab vastuen ek achumbakeey baks main band rakhi jaati hai
 Glass is placed in the front of the box, so that the mirror can be measured by deflection lamp and scale method
 jab kundali main vidyut dhara pravaahit hoti he, tab kundali ke do bhujaaon par balyugma kaary karata he or kundali ko uski sthiravastha se ghuma detaa he, jisase phosphor branj kii pattee or neeche kii sarpil kamaani main anthan aa jaati he or e anthan bal yugma kundali par vipareet disha main kaary karne lagata he
 Due to which the horoscope is soon in balance
 yadi kundali kaa vikshep kone tha ho, to dharaman nimna sutara se nikalataa he : That is, the current is proportional to the deflection angle
 ye dharamapi atyant sthaayee or yathesht sugranhak hote hai
 They can measure current up to 10 amperes
 chalkundal dharamapi mukhyatya do prakaar ke hote hai : In this, the coil is wrapped on a metal structure, which causes the coil to deflect quickly as the current flows
 jaise hi kundali gumti he, usamen or uske dhaatu ke dhaanche main bhavar dharaayen utpann hoti hai or kundali ko roak detii hai
 The horoscope does not oscillate, this is why this instrument is called dead-pulse
 dhara ke hatate hi kundali apni purv sthiti main pahunch jaati he
 Therefore, the value of the current can be determined very easily by the knowledge of the position of the coil and the position of the current
 is dharamapi main kundali ek achaalak dhaanche par bandhi rahati he or is kaaran usamen bhavar dhara nahin utpann hoti
 Hence there is very little resistance in the coil deflection
 kundali dhaatu ke dhaanche par aavisht na hone se dhara pravaahit kiye jane par, apni vikshepasthiti ke donon ore dolan karti he
 It is very sensitive and we can determine the transient charge before it is very accessible
 ye do prakaar ke hote hai : aakarshanwale tathaa pratikarshanwale
 If current flows through a stationary coil of insulating wires, a magnetic field is produced in and around the coil
 is kundali ke paas yadi kachche lohe kaa ek tukdaa lataka diya jaae, to vah kundali kii ore aakarshith ho jaataa he
 If this iron piece is fitted with an indicator, the indicator will also be deflected
 yadi koi aisi vyavastha ho ki lohe ke tukade par jo aakarshan bal he uske vipareet bal lagaakar use santulan main laayaa ja sake, to dhara kaa maan sanketak ke vikshep se pataa chal sakegaa
 Often this attraction is opposed by a spiral spring
 aakarshan bal dhara-maan ke varg ke samaanupati hota he
 Therefore the deflection of the indicator will also be proportional to the square of the current value
 isi kaaran yah prayavarti dhara kaa maan bhi gyaat kar saktaa he
 Between the stationary coils of several wheels of insulating wires, two soft iron thin rods are parallel to the axis of the coil
 ek chad to sthir rahata he, doosraa ek sanketak se judaa he jo swayan ek keel par laga he
 The other end of the indicator rotates on a dial
 jab kundali main dhara pravaahat hoti he, tab donon chad ek hi prakaar ke prerit chumbak ho jate hai
 According to magnetic laws they have repulsion and the iron attached to the indicator rotates, causing a deflection in the indicator
 isamen bhi vikshepanakon dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 These instruments are very simple and cheap
 jab naapane main bahut yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or anek pusht yantron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, tab isi siddhant par bane ameter or voltmapi prayog main laae jate hai
 In power houses, soft iron devices are mostly used on switchboards
 prerit chumbak main aakarshan yaa pratikarshan dharapravaah kii disha par nirbhar nahin hota
 The force is proportional to the square of the torrent
 is kaaran dhara pravaah kii disha kuch bhi ho, bal kii disha ek hi hoti he
 For these reasons, these instruments are used to measure both direct current or reverse current
 kundali ke prerakatv ke kaaran ye ucch aavriti kii prayavartin dhara ke maapnkaarya main nahin prayukt kiye ja sakate
 This type of ammeter depends on the thermal effect of the current
 jab dhara kisi chaalak se pravaahit hoti he, tab vah chaalak tapt ho jaataa he
 The value of the generated heat is proportional to 2 x
 yadi dhara ampiore main or pratirodh om main ho, to The value of heat is proportional to the square of the current, that is, it is not dependent on the direction of current
 isliye aise emeter dishtdhaara athwa prayavarti dhara donon hi ke naapane ke prayog main laae ja sakate hai
 This effect has been used in two ways in the measurement method: pehle prakaar kaa yantra sabase pehle 1883 main major kardyu ne banaaya tha
 hartmann-bron improved it
 taar main dhara bahati he or tapt hone ke kaaran usamen prasar hota he
 At this time, the segmental wire attached to the middle pulls the wire and the pulley rotates according to the spread
 saath hi saath ghirani main laga sanketak bhi vikshepit hota he or dhara kaa maan dial par darshit karata he
 In the absence of current, the wire gets cold and shrinks and the indicator then returns to its former state
 aise dharamapi saral or saste hone ke kaaran bahut prayog main laae gaye hai
 They do not have a coil, so they do not have inductance and a high frequency alternating current is also measured, but they are not sufficiently accurate and are unable to tolerate high currents
 inase adhik suvidhajanak or yatharth taapyugma vaale dharamapi hote hai
 Nowadays, high frequency alternating current is mostly measured by the same instruments
 dhara taar se pravaahit hokar use tapt karti he
 The confluence of the copper constanton temperature coupled to this wire is also heated
 is kaaran taapyugma main taap ke anupaat main vidyut vaahak bal utpann hota he
 It flows in a direct currentometer
 iske dial main anshankan rahane par vah pehali prayavarti dhara kaa maan pradarshit karata he

 With India being demographically huge, the Space Research Organization was established in India, looking at the primary potential of artificial satellites in the field of telecommunications
 1960-1970 The Indian Space Program is the concept of Dr
 Vikram Sarabhai, who has been called the father of the Indian Space Program

 With the establishment of the Indian space program in 1962, it started the launch of the research rocket, in which the proximity of the equator proved to be a boon
 ye sabhi nav-sthapit thumba bhu-madhyi rocket anusandhan kendra se prakshepit kiye gaye, jo ki dakshin kerala main tiruvantpuram ke sameep sthit he
 Initially, research rockets from the US and France were launched to study upper pressure, like Naik Apache and Kentor respectively, until the study began with ship-based research rockets in the Pacific Ocean

 ISRO planned to conduct a prototype test flight from Sriharikota Spaceport's first launchpad for February 2016
 lekin nirmaan kii samaapti ke aadhaar par taarikh ko antim rup diya gaya
 The proposed RLV is built in two parts; a single stage of a manned space plane, the second booster rocket to use solid fuel
 booster rocket expendable he, iskaa udan ke badd upyog nahin kiya jaayegaa
 While the RLV will return to Earth and land after the mission like a normal airplane
 prototip- 'arelvi-tidi' kaa vajan lagbhag 1
5 ton he or yah 70 kilometre kii oonchai tak ud saktaa he
 HEX was successfully completed on 1 May GMT, 23 May 2016
 ekikrut prakshepan yaan, bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan dwaara vikasit kiya ja rahaa ek prakshepan vaahan he
 The main objectives of the project are to design modular architecture that will replace rockets such as PSLV, GSLV Mk 1 / 2 and gslv3 etc
 with a family of launchers
 prithvi kii kaksha se baahar ke isro ke mishan main chandrayan-1 or mangal orbitor mishan mishan shaamil hai
 With ISRO Chandrayaan-2, it plans to follow missions such as Venus and near-earth objects such as asteroids and comets
 12veen panchavarshiya yojana, 2012-17 ke dauraan isro ne 58 antariksh mishnon ke sanchaalan kii yojana banaai hai, jiske liye anantim rup se 39,750 karod rupee ke yojana parivyay kii vyavastha kii gai he
 An amount of Rs 5,615 crore was allocated during 2012-13
 sahitya chaahe vah kisi bhi desh athwa bhashaa kaa ho, vah apane loksahitya or usamen maujuud jansanvaadan kii kala kaa sadaiv rini rahaa he
 He draws from the Shruti tradition, the base material for his main inspirations
 saamaajik kartavyon-dayitvon ke samhitakaran kaa kaary bhale hi vidwatvarg karata rahaa ho kintu uske paalan, sangrakshan tathaa desh-deshaantar tak failaav kaa kaary lok ke hisse hi aata he
 Therefore, in a country where the folklore is rich, it takes relatively less time to absorb culture and traditions as well as to imbibe new knowledge
 bharat main to shiksha kii parampara hi gurukulon se nikali he
 How many nachiketas have left the kingdoms in this country in search of truth
 yah baat alag he ki vidhivat shiksharjan kii suvidha pehle samaaj ke vishisht virgon tak hi simit thi
 As a result of which the seekers like Karna and Ekalavya have been searching for knowledge, eventually proved to be unhappy
 shiksha-vanchit varg ke liye jansanvaadan kii kala kaa mahatva samaaj ke baaki logon kii apeksha kahin adhik tha
 Particularly in the feudal times when the world of publishing was not as large and powerful as it is today, due to social relations, class complexity, majority of the population was denied resources
 tab jansamanya kii manoranjan-sambandhi aavashyaktaa ko puraa karne, anubhav tathaa gyaan kii paramparaon ko agali peedi tak le jane or unhen sahejkar rakhane ke liye jansanvaadan kii kala kaa sahaara liya jaataa tha
 It can be said that while the intellectuals created history and tradition, practice, cultural symbols and myths to collect and analyze them, on the one hand, they created the classical texts, while making them accessible to the public and making them part of life
 Along with Lokaranjan, the art of kissing developed
 kissagoi kii shuruyaat kab or kahaan par hui iske bare main thik-thik bataa paanaa to sambhav nahin he
 Only inference can be made
 sabhyataa ke aarambhik daur main jab manushya ne kisi anokhi vastu, praani yaa ghatana ke bare main kuch badha-chadhaakar, katipay rochak andaaj main or lokranjan kii vaanchhaa ke saath bayaan karne kii koshish kii hogi; to swaabhaavik rup main baaki logon main uske kahan ke prati lalak paidaa hui hogi
 As a result, the collective curiosity about those experiences and the tradition of listening to them repeatedly, in an interesting way, developed
 usamen kalpana kaa anupaat bhi uttarottar badhata chalaa gaya
 This led to the development of the art of folklore and storytelling
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kissa or kissagoi hai kya? The larger version of the story, which lasts for a relatively long period of time, with many twists in the plot, conflict of characters, emotions, mental instillation and conflict of thoughts, comes in the case
 ise baat athwa batakahi ke naam se bhi janaa gaya he
 The anecdote can also be a single story headline and a set of multidimensions
 kabhi-kabhi pradhan kathanak ke ird-gird vividh bhav-bhangimaaon se bharpoor kai laghu kahaniyaan lapet di jaati hai
 The tradition of making small stories a big storyline and making them into a story has been popular in almost all countries of the world, not only present but also popular
 unka swaroop bhi samay or paristhatiyon ke anusaar adalata-badalata rahata tha
 Kisago used to work on his ability and imagination to make them more interesting and memorable
 bandhe-bandhaae shabdon main kahen to kissagoi kalpana ke rasaatmak kahan kii kala he
 With which we all have a connection
 maa kii lori ke saath-saath


jab balak shabdon kaa arth pahchaanana shuru karata he, shaayad tabhi se
 Hypnosis which started from childhood due to anecdote does not diminish
 isamen kalpana kaa maadhurya bharaa hota he
 Such elegance would be contained in which the eyes begin to speak
 shabdon ko jubaan mil jaati he
 Arthas themselves become assertive
 kaalpanik hone ke baavjood uskaa varnan itnaa pramanik, rasmay or jeevant hota he ki shrota uske pravaah main bahe chale jate hai
 This is a particular genre in terms of writing
 jisamen kathakaar apane pathak ke saath sambodhan kii sthiti main hota he
 Instead of writing, he tells the story
 kathy main kissago kii rachanaatmakataa bhi shaamil ho jaati he
 Due to which sound beauty comes naturally in the composition and its eligibility is increased
 parinamtah pathak-shrota ko apekshaakrit adhik anand or tripti kaa anubhav hota he
 Kisagoi accepted in folk tradition becomes the classical language narrative
 jansanskruti main kisse-kahaniyon kaa bahut hi mahatva rahaa he
 Often the elders of the society handled the responsibility of the story
 kai baar yahi kala logon kii jeevika kaa aadhaar bhi ban jaati thi
 The fine art of telling a good story is a delight on gold
 aise prratibhavan kissago bhi rahe hai jo bina kisi purv taiyaari ke sirf apni kalpanaashakti ke bal par, ek sutra thamkar kahana prarambh karte or baat / bahakahi badhate-badhate mjedaar kahani yaa kisse kaa rup le leti thi
 Moral and social consciousness was so intense in traditional rural life that the individual not only recognized the dangers of deviation from them, but also tried to stay away from them as much as possible
 naitik evam saamaajik moolyabodh se parichit karaane ke liye use sahitya jaise kisi bahyah upkram kii aavashyaktaa utani nahin thi; jitani ki aaj mahasoos kii jaati he
 Then this work was done by various mediums related to religion and ethos
 duusare shabdon main sahakaar evam sashastitv ko samarpit tab ke gramyahjivan main saamaajik mulya, manas ke saath-saath viksit hote the tathaa unke bich dwait kii sthiti kam hi utpann hoti thi
 Certainly, the art of mass communication, which is also a form of storytelling, had a huge contribution in it
 or sanchaar madhyamon ke atirek ke bich, kam hi ho, magar aaj bhi usee tarah bana hua he
 Chapal culture has been the hallmark of agricultural societies
 har gaanv main ek chepal hona anivaary tha
 Not only this, the dignity of the entire village was determined by the materials used in its construction, architecture and crafts etc
 inhen chapaalon par kissagoi kii kala khub fali-phuli
 But it was not necessary for the story to choose Chappal for his skills
 garmiyon main pedo kii chhaanv tale maveshi charaate hue, barsaat main khule aasmaan ke neeche rimjhim buundon kaa anand lete hue, sardi main gaanv ke tirahon-chairahon par alaav tapate hue, abhavagrast jhonpadiyon main raat bitaate samay kisse-kahaniyon ke anwarat daur chalate hi rahete the
 Anurag towards Kisagoi was not limited to any particular section or community of the society
 balki samaaj ke praayah sabhi varg isamen ruchi lete the
 Some people's livelihood used to go on narrating an anecdote to the kings and emperors
 iske bhi kai pramaan hai ki puraane jamaane main badshaah ke darbar main kuch aise hunarmand log bhi hote the; jo unhen or unke shahjadon ko sirf kisse-kahani sunaaya karte the
 Successful storytellers did not have to wander for their livelihood
 sashastitv or aparigrah ko samarpit lokbhaavna uski jaruraton kii bharpai ke liye koi na koi vidhaan garh hi leti thi
 He used to keep on calling for them from nearby villages
 thalwaar ke dinon daksh kissago doordaraj ke gaanvon kii saiyr kar aate
 When such artists reached somewhere on the occasion of a fair, festival or marriage, there used to be a buzz
 din-bhar ke kaam ke baad apane anubhav or sukh-dukh baantne ke liye log unke paas jutane lagate
 Where the weather, apart from discussing various social conditions, entertainment was also taken care of
 jisamen gadhy or padya donon prakaar kii prastutiyaan sthaan paatin
 Among the poetry compositions, dhola-maru, Alha, Ramayana etc
 were prominent, and stories were heard mainly in prose
 jinamein aliff-laila, kissa tota-maina, sahasr rajaneecharitra, dastaane chaar darvesh, singhaasana batisi, vaital pachisi, kathasaritsagar, jataka kathaayen aadi pramukh the
 These stories were very popular in the general public and were heard and heard in different forms without knowing their original source
 yahi nahin avasar ke anuroop rochakata evam aakarshan banaae rakhane ke liye kissago unamem apni ruchi evam pratibhanuroop badlaav karne ko bhi swatantra rahete the
 Some stories were proactive both in prose and verse, and it depended on the ability of the story-artist and the choice of audience to choose which genre to present
 kathanak praayah shrotaaon ke jane-pahachaane hote the
 There was no claim of any story against his originality
 moulik hota tha kisse ke prastutikaran kaa andaaj
 Highly imaginative, original style, captivating communication and the inner struggle of the characters were able to bring the masses to their magical effect
 usee ke aadhaar par unki shreshthata ke daawey kaa nirdhaaran hota
 The result of the confirmation of Kisagoi tradition in the society was that Tulsidas starts Ramcharitmanas with the mouth of Kakabhusundi
 gita jaisi gahan-gambhir darshanik gaveshna kaa avataran shrikrishna ke mukh se hota he, arjuna vahaan maatra shrota he
 The entire Mahabharata is Sanjay's statement
 kissagoi style ke aadhunik gadhyakaron main devakinandan khatra, premchand, pandeya bechan sharma ‘ugr’, amritlal nagar, vijaydaan detha aadi kii lokapriyata kaa yahi rahasy he
 The magical realism present in Marquez's prose is in fact the elegance of Kissagoi; Whose world is being crazy today
 lokachar kaa anivaary hissaa hone ke kaaran jaruri he ki kissago ko lokmanas kii acchhee parakh ho
 He knows the art of choosing subjects according to his interest
 dhyatavya he ki kissagoi kaa vikaas samuhik manoranjan kii kala ke rup main hua he
 Within the story, the sense of address to the group is hidden
 manushya ek saamaajik praani he
 His joys and sorrows are shared
 isliye manoranjan athwa lokranjan ke madhyamon par sabhi kaa adhikaar ekasmaan hota he
 The story assumes that it is for the welfare of others, who are actually part of his own society
 tabhi vah prastutikaran ke liye aksar bagaiyr kisi laalach ke, keval apnatv evam sauhaard-bhaavana ke saath prastut hota he
 The spirit of public welfare and unwavering dedication to it is what makes Kissa and Kisagoi acceptable and useful
 pustakon main haalanki kissagoi keval ek style ke rup main maujuud rahati he
 And the reader is often alone when passing through them
 kintu uskaa prastutikaran samuhik sambodhan hi hota he, jahaan lekhak likhane ke bajaae sunaata he
 So that the reader always feels that he is not alone
 apitu brihad samaaj kii ek atimahatvapurn ikai he
 The same quality of storytelling proves him distinct and distinct from the other styles of communication and enhances his chances of folklore
 atah samuhikta ko kissagoi ke ek aavashyak lakshan ke rup me dekha ja saktaa he
 Along with collectivism, the spirit of universalism is also associated with the story
 yaddhapi duniya ke vibhinn deshon-samaajon kii bhugolic tathaa paristhitigat kaarnon se apni kuch khaas vishistataaen hoti hai
 They prove it different from other countries and societies
 iske baavjood alag-alag deshon or samaajon main rah rahe logon ke swabhaav main kuch samanthaayen bhi hoti hai
 They also bring them closer to each other
 jaise ki naitikta ko lekar duniya ke sabhi samaaj ek jaisaa soch rakhte hai
 In almost all human societies, compassion towards pranimatra has been considered a sublime human value
 isi prakaar daan ko aavashyak kartavya kii sangya sabhi samaajon main praapt he
 Conversely, false, dishonest, cheating, etc
, are considered as hey, and education to avoid them is given uniformly in all societies
 kissagoi kii safalataa ke liye jaruri he ki uske peeche shaashvat jeevanamoolya or sarvloukikta kii udaatt bhaavana nihit ho
 Only then does he get the support of people of different interest and ideas
 isi ke kaaran kissagoi pradhan rachanaaen desh-pradeshon kii simaaon ko parkar duniya-bhar kii yatra karne main kaamyaab siddh hoti hai
 In the meantime, though some difference comes naturally to them, but the original soul of the composition is often unchanged
 praayah vahi vishay kissagoi main sweekaaryata paane main safal rahete hai jo vivaad se pare hon tathaa jinaki saarvkalik upyogita siddh ho chuki ho
 Even at the level of entertainment, care is taken to ensure that it does not hurt the feelings of any person, religion or class
 or vah itnaa ‘balgar’ bhi na ho ki samooh main usko kaha-suna na ja sake
 Subjects which are beyond the boundaries of the country and after a little change can form the basis of the story of any society; In which the underlying truth has the potential to become the truth of majority societies, it is considered more popular in the stories
 kissagoi kaa janm hi lokranjan ke liye hua he
 People mainly come in contact with Kissago in search of entertainment
 kisse-kahani main antarnihit mulya uske baad kaa sthaan rahete hai
 Therefore, interestingness is also important in the essential characteristics of anecdote
 iske abhaav main kissago kii safalataa sambhav hi nahin he
 It should also not be taken to mean that only entertainment is intended for storytelling
 jivan or manushyata ke bare koi bhi bayaan tabhi mahatvapurn ban paata he jab vah yaa to kisi auchity kii vyakhya karata ho yaa usase kisi na kisi rup main judaa ho
 If Lokaranjan is based on positive characters, events or proves them to be varsity in any way, then the listener / reader usually takes inspiration from him
 atah kisse-kahani main naitikta ke prati aagrahashiltaa sadaiv apekshit hoti he
 But he should remain completely free from its pressure
 kisse-kahani main rochakata ke mulya par naitikta kii ghuspaith honi hi nahin chahie
 In other words, knowledge or value can be the byproduct or by-product of creative presentation, not the original product
 agar aisa he bhi to yah kaam itane kaushal se kiya janaa chahie ki pathak athwa shrota ko uskaa abhas tak na ho
 That is, the presentation of the work should be so effortless and juxtaposed that it binds the audience-readers to its magical charm
 kissagoi main kamyaabi kaa ek maapdand yah bhi he ki prastutikaran ke dauraan kissago apane pathak yaa shrota ko apane kitne kareeb laane main kaamyaab rahata he
 This quality of intimacy instills an affection for people in the heart of the story
 yahi uski lokapriyata ko nirantar aage le jaataa he
 Successful anecdote is the same with the raising of the voice, the listeners start to travel to the space and seeing its stagnation, they start feeling a bit stagnant
 jisaki rachana ko sunate yaa padhate samay shrota / pathak khud ko uske saath itnaa antarang anubhav karen ki kisi tarah ke dwait kii sambhaavna hi na rahe, sirf kissagoi ke pravaah main behate chale jaaen
 For this, Kissago has to go down several steps from his intellectual ego and communicate directly with his listener or reader
 kisi bhi prakaar kaa vishistataabodh ahmanyata kaa ehsaas kissago kii style ko na keval bojhil bana detaa he; balki shrotaaon / pathakon ko manoranjan ke anya sadhano kii ore bhi dhakel saktaa he
 Obviously, the presentation also has to be groomed and polished at the language level
 sahajabodhya muhaavareydaar bhashaa kaa prayog kissagoi ko nikhaarane main madad karata he
 As stated above, the anecdote is a departure from the tradition of artistic saying
 jisamen kissago apane anubhav, gyaan tathaa kalpana ke yoga se itihaas ke kisi ansh, ghatana athwa kathanak ko rochak andaaj main shrota ke samaksh prastut karata he
 Some such that the listeners get immersed in it
 yahaan tak vakt kaa ehsaas bhi unhen na rahe
 It is often addressed to a large audience
 jisamen ashikshit bhi ho sakate hai tathaa alag-alag mizaaj or ruchi ke bhi
 Linguistic burdens, stylistic miracles or ideological fanaticism have no place in anecdote
 sahaj-saral, muhaavareydaar or ravaanagi se bharpoor bhashaa hi kissagoi ke liye upyukt hoti he
 Passing this test is a challenge for every good story
 yah kissago kii apni style, rachanaatmakataa or prastutikaran ke kaushal par nirbhar karata he ki apane pathakon / shrotaaon ko kitna sammohit kar paata he
 The easy and opportunistic use of idioms and proverbs makes it popular and effective
 lekh ke is ansh main ham baalsahitya ke sandarbh main kissagoi kii upyogita kaa akalan karenge
 We will also try to find out why Kisagoi-dominated creations are more popular among children
 praayah sabhi samaaj langik aadhaar bhedbhaav ke shikaar rahe hai
 The art of kissing, however, has been popular among women and children alike
 kintu paristhitigat antar ke kaaran usamen kinchit bhinnata bhi rahi he
 Due to the dignity or extent of the chapel culture, young men, children and old people could go to the chapals
 parantu striyon or chote bacchon kaa vahaan janaa vibhinn kaarnon se nishiddh tha
 For this reason, the art of kissagoi developed equally in the homes, but with a slight variation
 donon main ek mukhya antar to yah rahaa ki chapaalon par jo kaam praayah daksh kissago athwa manje hue vyakti jo kahani sunaane kii kala main paarangat ho, dwaara kiya jaataa tha
 At the same time, this responsibility was taken up by the grandparents, maternal grandmother, aunt or any senior member of the family
 kisse-kahani ke madhyam se hi balak ko apni parampara, samskruti tathaa raajnneeti aadi kaa vyaavhaarik gyaan kara diya jaataa tha
 Anurag, who was born to an anecdote in childhood, used to take a person to the famous places of Kisagoi - such as the chayars, chapals and other such public places
 jabaki paristhatigat antar ke kaaran gharelu prastutiyaan praayah chote-chote kisson tak hi simit rah jaati thim
 Often the big stories narrated on chapals took the form of talk or talk in the form of a brief
 haalanki unamem bhi kissagoi kaa jaadu puri tarah vidyaman rahata tha
 It can be said that along with the early teaching-rites, a keen psyche for kissing, affection and attraction towards him began to be born from the courtyard of the house, mother's lap, and through him, the child attempts to understand the outside world
 used to do
 kissagoi kaa hi kamaal he jiske kaaran beete jamaane main bina kisi prakaashan suvidha, sanchaar madhyamon ke bhi kahaniyaan dur-daraaj ke deshon tak kii yatra kar aati thim
 The entire folklore is indebted to the art of kissing
 kissagoi kii lokapriyata or pahanch ke kaaran hi panchatantra kii kahaniyaan aaj duniya-bhar ke sabhi deshon main na keval prachlit hai balki sthaneey ruchiyon or paramparaon ke anuroop unamem vyapak badlaav bhi hue hai
 The best example of this is the stories of Aesop, on which Panchatantra has full influence
 chhathi shatabdi pehle janma isap yun to yunaan kaa ek maamuli gulam tha
 Appearance ugly
 parantu uske prashansakon kii kami nahin thi
 He was respected in his society
 isliye ki vah apane shrotaaon ko spandit karne kii kala main daksh ek behtareen kissago tha
 He had mastered the policy and practical knowledge in telling stories
 apni kahaniyon main usne panchatantra kii un kahaniyon kaa bhi upyog kiya jo hajaaron mile kii yatra ke baad yunaan pahunchi thim
 The stories of Aesop continued to travel from one country to another through Shruti for almost seventeen centuries
 chini darshanik kanceyucious ne bhi janamanas ke bich apane vichaaron ke prachaar-prasar ke liye drushtaant parampara kaa sahaara liya tha
 There is one more example that illustrates the importance of kissing
 ek baddimag badshaah kaa kissa jo apane aap main behad mjedaar he or aaj bhi khub ras le-lekar suna-sunaaya jaataa he
 In it, the king who is fond of tales gets angry with the princess on something
 dand se pehle budhimaan shahzadi use kissa sunaanaa chaahati he
 The king is ready
 magar jaise hi ek kissa samaapt hone ko hota shahzadi badi chaturaai or kalaatmakataa se usamen doosraa kissa jod detii
 The night passed while listening to anecdote
 badshaah kisse main itnaa dub jaataa tha ki uskaa baaki hissaa agali raat main sunne ke liye shahzadi ko ek din or jeene kii mohalat de detaa
 In this way, the days went by
 antat badshaah us budhimaan shahzadi ko kshamaa kar detaa he
 This single episode is enough to gauge the strength of the story
 jabaki pratik rup main yah kissa baadshahon kii jeevanstyli or baddimagi par kataaksh bhi karata he
 The effort of the Grimm brothers to compile the folklore of Germany has been appreciated worldwide
 unke dwaara sankalit lokkathaayen jagatprasiddh ‘grimes feiri tels’ naamak granth main sankalit hai
 To gather stories, the Grimm brothers went from village to village and heard stories from elders
 isi silsile main ek behad rochak ghatana he jiskaa zikr kahaniyon ke sankalan ke dauraan ke apane anubhavon kaa ullekh ke rup main grim bandhu kuch is tarah karte hai ki


ek baar jab ve ek gaanv main pahunche to vahaan unhen ek chudail budhiya ke bare main bataaya gaya
 With whom the villagers were reluctant to send their children
 kisi ne unhen yah bhi jaankaree di ki us budhiya ke paas kahaniyon kaa beshumaar khajaana he
 But at the same time, he also told that he is a 'magician and witch'
 

chudail he jo bacchon par aisa jaadu karti he ki bachche raat main daraavne sapane dekhakar cheekhte-chillaate hai
 The Grimm brothers set out to search for stories
 isliye ve us budhiya ke paas pahanche or usase kahani sunaane kaa aagrah kiya
 In response, the old lady made a bet that she could tell the story only when the children are present there as a listener
 udhar gaanvvaale apane bacchon ko budhiya ke paas bhejne ko jaraa bhi taiyaar nahin the
 This posed a formidable problem to the Grimm brothers
 budhiya ziddee thi
 In the fascination of folklore, the Grimm brothers were also not ready to return disappointed
 antat grim bandhuon ne apane ek mitra kii madad lee
 He explained to the villagers
 unke bacchon kii suraksha kaa aashwaasan bhi diya
 Eventually, after much effort, the villagers agreed to send their children to the old lady
 varshon se gaanvvaalon kii pratadna kaa shikaar, gaanv se dur or akeli rahati ai budhiya kii ankhon main bacchon ko dekhte hi chamak aa gai
 She agreed to tell the story
 or phir budhiya ne jaise hi pehla kissa shuru kiya, bacchon samet grim-bandhu bhi mantra-mugdh ho gaye
 The art of telling his story was so amazing and exciting that everyone started forgetting his temper for a while
 kahani sunaate-sunaate, prasanganuroop kabhi vah sher kii bhaanti gurraane lagati to kabhi chidiyon kii tarah chahchahana shuru kar detii
 As soon as the cat is mentioned in the story, she immediately starts miaoning
 yahi nahin apni aawaaj se budhiya aandhi, barish, badalon ke gadgadane jaise vichitra dhvaniprabhav utpann karne main paarangat thi
 There was a magical effect in his story
 jitani der tak budhiya ne kahaniyaan sunaayi, ve sammohit se sunate rahe
 After that, the whole mystery came to the understanding of the Grimm brothers
 ghatana ke prabhavi prastutikaran dwaara budhiya aise jeevant bimb utpann karti thi ki bacchon ko kahani ke paatra tathaa ghatnaayen vaastavik-se lagane lagate or sidhe unke dilo-dimag main paith jate
 Their effect also lasted long
 jisase ve sapanom main dar jate
 The Grimm brothers have described this experience in detail
 ve likhte hai ki bacchon ko to hamane us budhiya ke saamne bitha diya or ham khud baraabar ke kamare main parde ke peeche ja baithe
 The old lady started telling stories and we started scripting them
 grim-bandhu likhte hai ki ‘budhiya jab kahani sunaane lagi to hamane anubhav kiya ki vah shaayad kahani sunaane kii kala main maahir duniya kii sarvshereshth kissago thi
 

it would create the sound effects of rain, thunderstorms, animals, birds etc
 from her mouth and make the story highly effective
 is kahani kala kaa prabhaav hi vah jaadu tha; jo bacchon ke man-mastishk par chaa jaataa tha
 Due to the effect of the same, they were afraid to see those pictures in their dreams
 ’ is rahasy se anbhigya gaanvvaale budhiya ko jaaduugarani, dian, chudail aadi kahkar tirashkrut or laanchit karte rahete the
 We are all unanimous that children often prefer to listen to them than to read stories
 kahani sunate samay balak ke dimag par vaisaa dabaav nahin hota jaisaa use padhane ke dauraan aksar hota he
 So he goes on assimilating the story and the message contained in it
 kuch is tarah ki kahani kii ghatnaayen, usamen aae paatro ke vyaktitv, aadi uske maanas main viksit hote chale jate hai
 Due to the quality of intimacy, the pedestrian is more fond of those compositions which are done by talking face to face in a conversational manner
 atah yah style baalkon dwaara na keval sabase zyada pasand kii jaati he balki isman lekhak ke liye sarvaadhik prayog karne kii ganjaish bhi nihit hoti he
 For this reason, the same child literateurs have become more popular, who have written literature connecting Kissagoi with contemporary references
 pathakon ke saath sidhe samvaad kii sthiti main hone ke kaaran uski rachana main swaabhaavik pravaah bana rahata he
 a good anecdote resorts to pictorialism and theatricality to keep his audience engaged
 paathya pustakon main saamanytah gyaan ko aatmsaat karne kaa bahari dabaav rahata he
 Which creates tension in the child's mind
 jisase vah pathyapustakon se bhaagane kii koshish karata he
 Another truth is that textual style often resorts to narrative style
 vishay ke anuroop adhyayan style bhi uttarottar jatil hoti chali jaati he
 So that the child always feels that he is being taught or taught
 koi he jo usko khaas disha kii ore le janaa chahta he
 

 is made a barrier to his freedom
 

shiksha ke liye utsuk uskaa maanas kinchit vivashtaa ke saath pustakon ko padhata to he lekin saath-saath unase bachane kii lalak, unase dur bhaagane kii ichha, upadeshaatmakataa ke prati ek nishedh bhi uske man main umadta rahata he
 Kisago's familiarity and the compositions available in the Kisagoi style evoke him from the monotony of knowledge and presentation
 sampreshan kii anya shaileyon main lekhak or pathakon ke bich dwait ke halaat bane rahete hai
 Due to which the reader is not able to get the full juice of the composition
 use vah rachana upar se thopi hui-si prathit hoti he
 Kissagoyi is the most successful medium to take a child to the romantic world
 isamen kalpana kaa prachurya rahata he, buddhi kaa anaavashyak dabaav nahin, isliye bhi sampreshan kii yah style bacchon ko khaastaur par pasand aati he
 Here, knowledge is present in the composition as a condition of literature, but it is so special and hidden that the reader keeps on accepting it slowly without any pressure or sigh
 kalpana se milakar gyaan rochak or grahniya ban jaataa he
 One thing can be said as an accusation that there is an excess of imagination in Kisagoi-dominated compositions
 jo shrota athwa pathak ko yatharth se pare le jaati he
 Probably, this is the reason why the spread of Kisagoi has increased in comics, paintings, etc
 jabardast fantasiyukt pura-kathaayen or greek kathaayen bhi isi style ke praadhanya ke kaaran rochak hone ke baavjood aalochana kii paatra rahi hai
 But imagination is not always bad and discarded

 This was followed by Gaya where the comparative study of the Upanishads continued

 After this he came to Alwar on invitation and here he composed the word-comprehension book
 isaki mul prati ab bhi vahaan ke sangrahalay main rakhi he
 After this he stayed in Mathura where he established the school
 isamen desh bhar se sanskrit jigyaasu aae or rajputon kii taraf se daan bhi mili
 Around this time, Swami Dayanand Saraswati ji left the family in search of the true Guru with a desire to know the truth

 Where he got new vision, inspiration and self-power
 varshon tak bhraman karne ke baad jab ve bhagwaan shrikrishna kii janmasthali mathura main guru virajanand ji kii kutiyaa par pahunche to guru virajanand ne unase poocha ki ve koun hai
 Then Swami Dayanand said, "guru, i want to know who i really am
" Satisfied with the answer to the question, Guruwar made Dayanand his disciple
 swami virajanand ucch koti ke vidwaan the, unhone veda mantron ko nai drushti se dekha tha or vedon ko ek naveen vyavastha pradaan kii thi
 He made Dayanandji practice the Vedas
 adhyayan puraa hone ke baad jab dayanand ji guru virajanand ji ko guru dakshina ke rup main thodi se laung, jo guru ji ko bahut pasand thi lekar gayi to guru ji ne aisi dakshina lene se manaa kar diya
 He told Dayanand that as Guru Dakshina, i want to end the blind faith and evil practices in the society
 guru ji ke aadesh ke anusaar swami dayanand saraswati ji ne bharat ke saamaajik, saanskrithik or rajnatik utthan main apana mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 In his memory, a memorial was built on the Grand Trunk Road of Kartarpur, the foundation stone of which was laid by Shri Badrinath Arya

 The contribution of the Arya Samaj in the freedom movement and the Vedic revival has been highly acclaimed and its founder Dayanand ji got it from Gyan Swami Virjanand therefore his contribution in modern India needs to be further appreciated

 Adventure Game is a computer-based game that consists of an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle solving rather than physical challenge in which the player is considered the main protagonist
 isaki style kahani par kendrit hoti he jo sahitya or film jaise anya kahani-aadhaarit media se grahan karne kii anumati detii he or saahitiyik shaileyon ke vistrut prakaaron se ghiri hoti he
 Almost all adventure games are designed for a single player, as multi-player games are increasingly difficult to design due to the emphasis on story and characters
 pashchimi duniya main, is style kii lokapriyata 1980 ke dashak ke ant or 1990 ke dashak ke madhya ke dauraan badi, jab kai logon kaa maananaa tha ki yah sabase adhik unnat takanic vaali style he or ab ise kabhi-kabhi aalaa style mana jaataa he
 In East Asia on the other hand, adventure games continue to have popularity as a visual novel, compensating for about 70% of PC games released in Japan
 "adventure game" shabd kii utpatti 1970 ke dashak ke computer game adventure se hui he, jo gemple kii ek style kaa agragami ban gaya jiskaa vyapak rup se nakal kiya gaya or apane aap main ek style ban gaya
 Therefore, unlike the literary genre, the video game genre is defined by its gameplay, as the literary genre is defined by the subject it addresses, which is the adventure verb
 style ke aavashyak tatwon main kahani, anveshan or paheli suljhaana shaamil he
 The adventure game is described as a puzzle embedded in a narrative framework where the game "contains narrative content that a player opens step by step
" " jabaki khilaadiyon ko kahani ke madhyam se praapt paheliyaan ek paksheeya ho sakati hai, jisamen kahani se khilaadi baahar nahin nikalate unhen achche dizin kaa udhaaharan mana jaataa he
 Adventure games have little or no battle and action challenges, which sets them apart from action games
 andrew rollings and arnest adams on game dizin pustak main lekhak ne kaha ki "iskaa arth yah nahin hota ki adventure game main koi vivaad hi nahin hota


lekin itnaa jarur he ki yuddh praathmik gatividhi nahin he
 "some adventure games will incorporate a minigame from other video game genres, which is not always appreciated by purists
 beshak, isamen kuch aise game hai jisamen shuru se ant tak ection or adventure kaa mishran hota he
 This type of mixed action adventure game has more physical challenges than a pure adventure game, as well as faster speed
 is paribhaasha ko lagu karnaa kaaphi kathin hota he, haalanki, cone sa game ection game he or kismen kitna gaiyr-shaareerik chunautiyaan hone se ection-adventure ke rup main suvichaarit kiya jayega, iske bare main dizinron ke bich bahes main shaamil he
 Adventure games also differ from role-playing video games that include action, team building, and point management
 adventure game main sankhyatmak niyamon kaa yaa role-plaing game main jo sambandhon ko dekha jaataa he, abhaav hota he or kabhi-kabhi ek aantarik arthvyavastha hoti he
 These games lack a skill system, combat or "defeat the opponent with strategy and combat skills
" " haalanki, kuch mishran game isamen maujuud hote hai, jahaan majboot katha or paheli tatwon ke saath role plaing game ko rpg-romaanch mana jaataa he
 Ultimately adventure games are classified separately from puzzle games
 haalanki ek adventure game paheni hal ko shaamil kar saktaa he, ve aam taur par ek interactive-kahani main khilaadi niyantrit avatar ko shaamil karte hai
 Adventure games include a variety of puzzles, such as decoding messages, receiving and using things, opening closed doors, or finding and discovering new locations
 paheli kaa hal game duniya ke nae kshetron ke acces ko kholta he or game ke anya kahaniyon ko prakat karata he
 Logic puzzles, where mechanical devices are designed with imaginary interfaces to test a player's deductive reasoning skills, are simple
 kuch paheliyon kii aalochana apane hal kii aspashtataa liye kii gai he, udhaaharan ke liye da launguest jarney main kapade kii rassi kaa sangyojan, clamp or ikattha karne ke liye chipka hua shunaya rabad kaa istemaal, jo game kii kahani se baahar hota he or khilaadi ke liye keval ek baadha utpann karti he
 Others have been criticized for requiring players to blindly guess, by clicking on the right pixel, or by guessing the correct action in the game that uses a text interface
 ve game bhi jisamen khilaadiyon ko kutilmarg ke liye morganirdesan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, kam lokapriy hai, haalanki praarambhik paath-adventure game main aamtaur par khilaadiyon ko yadi ve kaalpanik sthaan kaa morganirdesan karnaa chaahate hai to unhen map banane kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 Many adventure games use a specific management screen as a separate gameplay mode
 Players are able to obtain only a few items in the game, so players usually know that it is important to get only one item
 kyonki yadi ve ek mahatvapurn vastu ko bhul jate hai to use jaanane ke liye khilaadi ke liye kathin ho saktaa he, vastu ke liye ve aksar prayek drishy ko saaf karenge
 He uses a point-and-click tool for the game, sometimes players will engage in a systematic search, known as a pixel hunt
 vastuon ko ujagar karne yaa vastu ke liye khilaadi ke cursar ke tadak ke dwaara game inase bachane kii koshish karti he
 Some items are often depicted in various adventure games and used in many ways
 iske do udhaaharan hai rassi or ek lohdand
 kuch vastuon kaa istemaal chal rahe parihaas ke hisse ke rup main hota he, udhaaharan ke liye unke mul uddeshy prayojan se dur kai asangat sthitiyon main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Many of the puzzles in these games involve aggregation and use of material from their inventory
 khilaadiyon ko parshvik soch takneekon ko lagu karnaa chahie jahaan ve apratyaashit tareeke se vastuon ke bare main vaastavik duniya main bahya gyaan ko lagu karte hai
 For example, by inserting an inner affixed to a cactus to form a slingshot, in which a player must feel that the inner tube is flexible
 unke upyogi pramanit karne se pehle apane vastu suchi se lambey samay ke liye ho saktaa he unhen iskaa nirvaah karne kii aavashyaktaa pade or is prakaar adventure game ke khilaadiyon kii smriti kaa pareekshan karnaa saamaanya he jahaan game ke purv main ai hui kuch soochnaaon kii smriti dwaara chunauti kaa saamana kiya ja saktaa he
 There is rarely a time limit pressure for these puzzles and instead of sharp thinking, the players' reasoning talent is given attention
 adventure game ekal-khilaadi anubhav he jo ki sarvaadhik rup se kahani dwaara sanchalit hota he
 The Isi more than other styles, adventure games depend upon their story and setting to create a compelling single-player experience
 aamtaur par unka samaayojan ek dhyanamgn vaataavaran main kiya jaataa he, jo ki aksar ek kaalpanik duniya hoti he, or naveenta ko jodne ke liye or anubhav main ruchi paidaa karne ke liye khand sah khand samaayojan ko badalane kii koshish karte hai
 Comedy is a common theme and often laughable reactions are written in the game when players perform or combine actions that are "funny and impossible"
 jab se adventure game kahani ke dwaara sanchalit hone lage hai, charitron kaa vikaas aamtaur par nai shaktiyon yaa kshamtaaon kii bajaae vyaktigat or bhaavnaatmak vikaas ke saahitiyik sammelnon kaa anusaran karti he
 Players often engage in a quest, or need to solve a mystery or a situation about which there is little knowledge
 is prakaar kii rahasyamay kahaniyaan dizinron ko is prakaar kii samasyaon se nipatane kii anumati detii he jise arnest adams "problem of amanesia" kehete hai, jahaan khilaadi mukhya kirdaar ko niyantrit karata he lekin uske gyaan or anubhav ke bina hi game ko shuru karnaa hota he
 Story events typically unfold as the player completes new challenges or riddles, but new elements in the story can be activated by players' moves in order to make the stories less mechanical
 adventure game main mahatvapurn samvaad ke saath majboot kahani hoti he or kabhi-kabhi vachya abhinaytaon se recorded samvaad yaa ghatnakram kaa prabhaavasheel istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This style of game is known to represent dialogue in the form of a conversation tree
 menu se purv main likhe samvaad se ek vaakya chunane ke madhyam se khilaadi ek gaiyr-khilaadi charitra ko sanlagn karne main sakasham hote hai, jisase game charitra se ek pratikriya sakriy hota he
 These conversations are often designed as a tree structure, where the player decides to move between each branch of the dialogue
 haalanki, anugaman karne ke liye vahaan hameshaa hi shakhaon kii ek simit sankhya hoti he or kuch adventure game ek ke baad prayek vikalp kaa chayan kar avakramit hote hai
 Clues about how to solve the initiative can be found by interacting with the characters, including clues about what the characters want before collaborating with the player
 anya baatcheet main doorgaami nishkarsh hota he, jaise ek mahatvapurn rahasy ke pardaaphos kaa nirnay jo ki khilaadi ko saunpa jaataa he
 Characters can also be assured to expose their secrets through conversation or giving them something that is beneficial to them
 adventure game main praathmik lakshya saunpe gaye khoj ko puraa karnaa he
 Early adventure games often had high scores and some, such as Jork, as well as a rank given to players, a textual description based on their score
 ucch score, khilaadi ko ek madhyamik lakshya ke saath pradaan karata tha, or pragati ke ek sanket kaa rup diya jaataa he
 While higher scores are now less common, additional award systems such as Xbox Live Achievement demonstrate a similar role
 adventure game main praathmik vifaltaa kii sthiti he khilaadi kii mrityu, jise apekshaakrit adhik ection-unmukh khelon se liya gaya he
 Without identifying obvious enemies of other genres, it is controversial to be included in adventure games, and many developers now either avoid it or take additional steps before notifying death
 kuch praarambhik adventure gemon main jeet hasil karne ke aksham sthitiyon main game samaapt hone ke bina hi khilaadiyon ko fansaa liya jaataa he
 Infocomm's text adventure The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has been criticized for its visual planning where the game was released long before the game was over to prevent players from failing to pick up the bundle of junk mail at the beginning of the game Is stopped
 text adventure ko interactive fiction ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, paath ke anuchhed ke madhyam se khel kii kahani ko sampreshit kiya jaataa he, likhe nirdeshon ke uttar main khilaadi ko bataaya jaataa he
 In early text adventures such as Adventure, "hugo's House of Horror" and Scott Adams games, these instructions are interpreted using simple verb-noun phrase interpreters and at the basic level the player is allowed to interact with objects, such as By typing "gate key" or "open door"
 Later text adventure and modern interactive imagery can explain more complex sentences
 graphic adventure, adventure game he jisamen graphics kaa upyog khilaadi ke liye paryaavaran ko sampreshit kiya jaataa he
 The game can have a variety of inputs from a text parser to a touch screen interface under a graphic adventure banner
 point-and-clic adventure saamaanya prakaar ke graphic adventure hai jisamen khilaadi paryaavaran or paheli ko sulajhane ke liye ek pointer or aamtaur par ek mouse kaa istemaal karata he
 This input method is popular in style and is quite conducive to interaction with the environment, as it opposes direct control schemes that emphasize character control
 graphic adventure game is baat se bhinn rahenge ki kaise ve avatar ko pesh karte hai
 Some games will use a first-person or third-person perspective where cameras chase players' moves, while many adventure games use case-sensitive cameras that are positioned at the appropriate locations to show the best effect of each location goes
 paheli romaanch, romaanch khel hai jo ki vastu ekatrikaran, vastu prayog, charitra sampark yaa sajeesh jaise tatwon ke keemat par pehali hal par kaaphi jor detii he
 Instead, they usually reveal secret meanings through the proper use of discovery and complex processes, often similar to the Rub Goldberg machine
 in gemon kii sajeesh aspasht hoti he or paheliyon ke anyonyata ke madhyam se sampreshit ho sakate hai
 Many puzzle adventures are played from a first-person perspective, with the player "moving" between pre-rendered 3D images, sometimes combined with short animations or videos
 style ke udhaaharan main shism, Atlantis: The Lost Tales, riddle of da sphinks, Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure, or mist shaamil hai, jisane is game kaa maarg prashast kiya
 One type of puzzle adventure is the Escape the Room sub-genre, which consists of short games where the only object is to find a way out of the room
 ye game aamtaur par graphic point-and-clic style main lagu hote hai jo aksar adob flash praaroop par hote hai
 Examples of the sub-genre include Submachine-series, Mystery of Time and Space and Crimsom Room
 visual novel ek adventure game he jisamen adhikanshtah aparivarti graphics hota he, aamtaur par aneme-style kala hoti he
 As the name may indicate, they resemble mixed-media novels or live-stage stage plays
 drishy upanyaas vishesh rup se japan main prachlit hai, jahaan ve pisi game ke lagbhag 70% jari ko puraa karte hai
 They are rarely manufactured for video game consoles, but most popular games are shipped to systems such as the Dreamcast or playstation 2
 haalanki east asia ke baahar ke bazaaron main drishy upanyaas kaaphi simit hai
 In many ways, visual novels overlap with Japanese adventure games, including a menu-based interface for all navigation and connectivity, reminiscent of ICOM games
 japani adventure game main shaayad hi kabhi parade ke avatar yaa saamaanya suchi aadhaarit paheli shaamil hoti he or drishy upanyaas main to paheliyon yaa vastav main khel par or bhi kam bal diya jaataa he
 Instead, these titles are driven by the narrative, focusing specifically on the characters' interactions in a structure similar to the Choose Your Own Adventure story
 drishy upanyaason main aksar romantic kathaayen hoti hai jisamen mukhya charitra kaa kai sambhavit saathiyon main se kisi ek ke saath samaapan ho saktaa he
 This premise is similar to dating sims, but they are distinct from them, lacking the statistics-based sim elements in which the player stands out his character and instead relies on simple choices of dialogue, action, or navigation
 drishy upanyaas japan main pisi software bikri or ek dashak se bhi adhik ke liye anya east asian deshon kaa ek stepal he, isiilie lokapriy sheershakon ko santvanaa ke liye rakhaa he or yahaan tak ki kuch lokapriy manga or aneme series un par aadhaarit he: vaise sheershakon main kii dwaara kanon, air or clanad ; age ke dwaara rambilling harts or skool days ; 07wein vistaar ke dwaara higurshi no naku koro ni ; tip-moon dwaara phet / ste nite shaamil hai
 The visual novel is sometimes called "dating sims" in the West, as many visual novels track the figures that the player must put in order before the plot
 yah bhi isliye kyonki kai drishy upanyaas samaapan ke prakaaron kii anumati detii hai or ek aam rekhamay adventure sajeesh kii bajaae khilaadi ke ection ke liye adhik gatisheel pratikriyaaon kii anumati detii he
 The cultural differences between Western and Japanese adventure games are very close to those of role-playing games, such as the narrative linear and the later strong-scripting
 text adventure ke rup main pehla adventure game dekha gaya jisamen aamtaur par upyogkarta ke saath samvaad ke liye kriya-sangya pad vyakhyayitr kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 They evolved into commercial games by early mainframe titles such as Hunt the Womps and Adventure, which were played on personal computers such as Infocom's widely popular Zork series
 kuch companiyon ne bina text ke adventure game ko laane main mahati bhoomika nibhaai jisamen adventure international, infocom, label 9 computing, magnetic scrol or melbern house the, jisamen infocom kaaphi bahucharchit hai
 The story of the old adventure game was as if the player himself settled the game world
 game main nayak ke bare main koi vistrut soochna spasht nahin kiya jaataa tha, khilaadi ko use yaa khud ko avatar ke rup kalpana karne kii anumati di jaati thi
 In the mid-1970s, programmer, tunnel and role-player William Crowther developed a program known as Adventure
 crouther, bolt kaa ek karmchaaree, beranek or newman ne game ke nirmaan ke liye company ke PDP-10 kaa upyog kiya, jisamen 300 kilobite memory kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The game used a text interface to build an interactive adventure through an underground tunnel system, which was based on a part of the Mammoth tunnel system in Kentucky
 crouther ke kaary ko baad main stenford main SAIL computer kaa istemaal kar programmer don woods dwaara sanshodhit or vistaarit kiya gaya, or praarambhik computer utsakon ke bich game betahasha lokapriy ban gaya or 1970 ke dashak ke ant main navankur ARPANET bhar main fail gaya
 The combination of realistic cave detail and ludicrous elements proved to be extremely attractive and defined the adventure game genre for decades
 talwaar, jaadu shabd, paheliyon main shaamil vastuon or vishaal bhumigat sthaan, sab text adventure style ke pramukh ban gaye
 The "armchair adventure" quickly spread beyond college campuses as the microcomputing movement gained steam
 adventure ke anek rup 1970 ke dashak ke ant main or 1980 ke dashak ke prarambh main dikhaai di, jisamen ri-christen colozal adventure yaa colozal kev ke kuch baad ke sanskaran bhi shaamil hai
 Programmer Scott Adams was also one of many fans of Colossal Cave
 adventure grandmaster stats hasil karne se pehle adventure main apni pehali shuruuaat ke liye adams ne game tay karne ke liye lagbhag das din kaa samay bitaayaa, yah sheershak use pradaan kiya jaataa he jo crouther or woods sanskaran main uchit rup se 350 kaa score karata he
 Once he completed the game, Adams wondered how an adventure-like game like his TRS-80 could be developed on a home computer
 mukhya baadha yah thi ki vastav main TRS-80 jaisi home computer main adventure jaise badi game ko chalaane ke liye paryaapt memory nahin hoti
 ucch-str kii bhashaa ke vikaas or BASIC main likhe interprator ke dwaara adams ne in simaaon par kaary kiya, jo ki yah drushtikon atirikt adventure game ke vikaas ke liye code ko phir se istemaal karne kii anumati degi
 In 1978, Adams, along with his wife Alexis, founded International Adventure in order to sell their games
 unka pehla game adventureland TRS-80 ke liye adventure kaa ek sanskaran tha jo ki bechney ke liye pehla vyavsaayik adventure game bana
 His second game, Pirate Adventure, was an original game in the same genre as Adventure - with its source code written in BASIC, published in the December 1980 edition of Byte magazine
 unke tisare game mishan imposible tak adams ne apane software kii gati badhaane ke liye essembali bhashaa main programing kii shuruuaat kii
 Before the industry collapsed, which in 1985 led the company to go bankrupt, Adventure International produced the Cool 12 adventure game
 1982 main, david pegh ne apane stenford computer lab ke daura ke dauraan ARPNET liya gaye adventure game ke liye mul strot code kii print kii khoj kii
 At the time, he was working at computer retailer Computerland in Tacoma, Washington
 sambhavit graahakon ke liye vishesh suvidha pradaan karne ke liye david pegs ne mul kaarykram saamagree ko sanshodhit kiya taaki vah computerland company dwaara beche jane vaale sabhi computer par chale
 unhone prayek graahakon ko game main vibhinn sthanon main jane ke liye pasch dwaar kaa jaadui shabd pradaan kiya
 Whose password was "XYZZY"
 "adventure game tab tak ke liye muft program ke rup jari tha jab tak use vah vyavsaayik khudara sthanon main paarit kiya or jo bhi graahak usase computer kharidta use vah muft main detaa tha
 At that time, Adventure was the first game played in such systems
 baad main maheenon main microsoft adventure ko plastic ke foulder main 8 yaa 5 1 / 4 inch ke chote se flopi main $49
95 kii keemat par jari kiya gaya tha
 The interesting aftermath is that the magic words inside the Microsoft Adventure Program code were XYZZY
 dev labling or mark blank, computer science ke liye emiti ke prayogshaala ke chaatr the, jab unhone crouther or woods adventure kii khoj kii
 Together with Tim Anderson and Bruce Daniels, they began developing a similar game Zork, which began to be activated on PDP-10 minicomputers and was universally distributed to ARPANET
 snaatak str par chaatro ne apane netaa albert veza ke saath home computer ke liye zork ke vipanan ke liye ek company kholane kaa faisla kiya, or 22 june 1979 main tim anderson, joel berez, mark blank, mike bruce, scot katler, stu geli, dev labling, je

 liclydar, kris reeve or albert veza infocom main samavisht hue
 The developers also faced the same difficulties as Scott Adams in porting the Zork to the microcomputer: the PDP-10 version that reached a size of megabytes, which for the time was more and the Apple II and TRS- 80 were potential targets, each with only 16 kb of RAM
 unhone is samasya kaa samaadhaan game ko teen episod main baant kar kiya or ZIL kaa vikaas kiya, jise kisi bhi computer main infocom ke Z-mashin kaa istemaal kar kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki madhyavarti ke rup main vyavsaayik utpaada kaa istemaal hone vaala pehla abhaasi mashin he
 New Zork I: The Great Underground Empire was made available for PDP-11 in November 1980: a month later it was released for TRS-80 and sold more than 1,500 copies between that day and September 1981
 usee varsh, bruce danniel ne appal II sanskaran ko antim rup diya or 6000 se bhi atirikt pratiyaan bechaa gaya
 Zork i sold over a million copies
 company ne text adventure game ke vikaas ko jari rakhaa, yahaan tak ki profeshnal software ke vikaas ke liye ek vibhaag ko bhi kholaa gaya, jo ki aisa vibhaag he jo kabhi bhi laabhadaayak nahin rahaa
 High-quality games were successful in all genres, with a large, intelligent plot, unequaled syntax analyzer and skillful documentation as an integral part of the game
 lekhak duglas adams ne infocom ke saath do game kaa nirmaan kiya, jisamen unke hichahaikar guide tu da gelexi shrinkhalaa or kam gyaat adventure game jise beuroperesi kehete hai, par aadhaarit he, jo gatisheel gharon main jheli gai samasyaon se prerit he
 With the increasing power of microcomputers and demand for graphics, Infocomm felt a decline in sales and after being swallowed by Activation in 1989, the Infocomm branch had only ten employees, compared to 100 employees at its peak
 haalanki baad ke sheershakon kaa vipanan infocom brands ke tahat hi hua or infocom shakha ko band kar diya gaya or game kaa vikaas 1989 ke baad hua lekin mul team se uskaa koi sambandh nahin tha
 The closure of infocomm marked the end of the business journey of interactive imagery and post 1989 interpreters were rarely seen
 iske baavjood, pravesh ke liye nune baadha sunishchit karata he ki IF lekhakon ke jeevant or rachanaatmak samudaay internet par falan jari he, jisamen inform jaise bhashaa kaa istemaal kar rahaa he, jo ki utpann file ko infocom ke swayan ke Z-mashin se padhaa ja saktaa he
 Graphics was introduced in 1980 by a company called on-line Systems, which later changed its name to Sierra on-line
 mistary house jaise sierra ke praarambhik graphic adventure main buniyadi vector graphic kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, lekin jaldi hi in peshewar kalakaaron dwaara isaki jagah bitmap graphics kaa chayan kiya gaya
 Examples of this include Return of Herakles by Stuart Smith, Sherwood Forest, Muskerade of Dale Jonsson, Transylvania of Antonio Antiochia, Kings West of Sierra and Adventure Construction Set, an early hit by Electronic Arts
 1980 ke dashak main kai sankhyaon main game ko 8-bit home computer prarup main jari kiya gaya jo ki text adventure style kaa unnat rup he or colozal kev adventure jaise game or sierra ke sadrush tareeke ke game se udbhav hua he, jisamen pad vyakhyayitr yaa parmparik adventure ke sadrush input pranali main joda gaya he
 An example of this is the Gargoyle game's Heavy on the Magic which features a text input system with an animated display screen, and later spellbound games such as Magic Knight games that use a window-menu system to allow text adventure style input
 1984 main point-and-clic interphes ke saath appal mekintosh ke shubharambh ke baad ek nae prakaar kaa game ubhara

 The second follow-up in 1987 saw the famous Chedogate being released and lucasarts also entered the field with Meniac Manson, a point-and-click adventure who later found strength
 lukasarts kaary kaa ek pramukh udhaaharan monki iceland shrinkhalaa he
 The installation of many adventure games for such high quality bitmap graphics required sufficient storage capacity with the need for multiple diskettes, which would remain the case until the creation of cd-roms

 After working on its design for a month, she was able to persuade her husband Ken Williams not to work on the FORTRAN compiler, which was developing in order to work on the game on her Apple II computer 
 multah hai-res adventure ke rup main janaa jaataa he, mistary house pehla graphic adventure game tha, or isamen saadhaaran do-shabd parcer ke saath prayek parivesh ke sadish graphics kii visheshtaayen thi
 Mystery House sold heavily, and although Kane believed that the developing market would have less of a gaming market than the professional software market, he and Roberta stayed with the game
 is prakaar, 1980 main williams ne on line system kaa nirmaan kiya, jo ki baad sierra on-line bana
 Soon Sierra started moving forward
 is samay tak adventure game main pehla vyakti tha; khilaadi ke ankhon ke madhyam se sajaavat ke rup main chhaviyon ko pesh kiya gaya
 The Williams Company will debut another feature in the King's West series: a game in the third person
 Taking advantage of the techniques developed in the action game that progressed in parallel, Kane introduced an animated character that represented the player in the game and controlled the player
 3D anemated adventure ke saath ek nae maanak kaa nirmaan hua or lagbhag sabhi udyogon ne ise apanaaya
 adeshon ko tab bhi kunjeepatal par darj kiya jaataa tha or vaakyavinyas vishleshan dwaara vishleshit kiya jaataa tha, jaisaa ki text adventure game main kiya jaataa he
 Soon after, Sierra had successful series of ongoing adventure games with a number of games in each, including King's Quest, Police Quest, Space Quest, Lizard Suit Leary, and Hero Quest
 kuch saalon ke baad in shrinkhalaaon kii shuruuaat kii gai, cmand cursar ke upar kii clasik graphics ko puri tarah "point or clic" game play or vaga graphics ke saath badal diya gaya tha
 Other notable series include Fantasmagoria and Shivers; Sierra's final and most critically acclaimed series was the Gabrielle Knight series, which began in 1993 and ended in 1999 with Sierra's last adventure game
 siyara ne ek nae game kaa vikaas kiya or 1998 main sendent dwaara kharide jane tak adventure gaming ke simaaon ko aage badhaayaa
 uske baad 1998 main sendent ne apana puraa interective software shakha ko $1 billian main havas interective ko bech diya, jo ki vivendi universal kaa sahaayak tha
 Sierra continued the technology for its games which was the most advanced genre at the time
 haalanki, plastesan ke jari hote hi adventure game yug kaa samaapan hua; kyonki graphic swaroop main 3D sabase prabhavi ban gaya tha or adhikansh 2D adventure bazaar peeche hatana shuru ho gaya tha
 With nearly 20 years of involvement in the adventure game business, Sierra has included a number of notable game designers including Roberta Williams, Jane Jensen, Al Lowe, Scott Murphy, Jeff Tunnel, and Lori Ann and Kore Cole
 japan ke pracheenatam drishy upanyaas or shighratisheeghra ek graphic adventure game, yuji horo dwaara chansoft ke 1983 murder mistary game portapia renzoko satsugin jiken tha

 chansoft ne baad main adventure game ke sound noval ke nirmaan main jute gaya, jisamen kamitachi no yoro, maachhi, or kai haal ke hi 428: Fūsa Sareta Shibuya de shaamil hai 
 Portopia was later inspired by Hideau Kojima to enter the video game industry and later to create his own graphic adventure such as Snatcher, Polisnotes and Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel
 He was the highest-regarded adventure game in the West for a long time and is the only one in recent years to be released in significant numbers in the West, particularly on the Nintendo DS console, with the mystery-solving title as the Ace Attorneys series
 And went to Hotel Dusk: Room 215

 Although most Japanese adventure games have been graphical, there are also several text-based adventure games
 aisa hi ek udhaaharan he Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki, jo ki consol role-plaing game ke krono shrinkhalaa ke liye guyden ke rup main he
 The visual novel of the Japanese adventure game is a distinctive form, which includes many traditions that are less popular in the West
 ve lagbhag universali pratham-vyakti or pramukhtah samvaad dwaara sanchalit hai
 They also use menu-based interaction and navigation, with point and click implementations that differ slightly from western games

 In 1987, a programmer named Ron Gilbert worked for Lucasfilm Games Company - since then named lucasarts - which created the scriptwriting system SCUMM that uses point-and-click interfaces similar to ICOM simulation macventure games, It was first unveiled in 1985
 vaakyavinyas vishleshak main aadesh ko tip karne ke bajaae pranali ko text pratik ke madhyam ke dwaara niyantrit kiya gaya
 To interact with its environment, the player clicks a command into an icon representing an image on its list or a portion of the image
 is drushtikon kaa istemaal pehali baar meniek menson game main achche prabhaav ke liye lukasarts dwaara kiya gaya
 lucasarts Adventure distinguished itself from its main competitor the giant Sierra by rethinking some of the game's concepts and making some improvements to the game
 khel ke dauraan marane kii sambhaavna samaapt ho gai or yah sunishchit karne ke liye har prayaas kiya gaya ki khilaadi kabhi bhi puri tarah naa fanse

 Gilbert attempted in Meniac Manson and Zuck mccracken & Alien Mindbenders although kept it in 16 colors and the point-and-click engine still had remnants of text parsing, since the player would still have to configure the sentences to click with the game's images Will have to be done using qualified keywords
 256 color, ek atyaadhunik point-and-clic ingine, vaikalpik pratikriyaaon ke saath samvaad vyavastha, item ke saath paheli hal, mul graphics, vaataavaran sangeet or ek vishesh swabhaav bhaavana ke saath da sicret of monki iceland main yah kaary puraa hua

 lucasarts did not publish any adventure games for more than eight years after the 2000 release of Escape from Monkey Iceland, and the sequels of Fool Throttle and Sam & Max were canceled

 In 1993, Cyanne released Mist, a first-person adventure and used the additional storage capacity of cd-roms for previously introduced three-dimensional graphics, video and audio
 CD-ROM par pehla game ke prakashit hone ke baavjood, ek CD-ROM drive kii aavashyaktaa hui, jisase game kaaphi safal ban jayega
 Mist was an unusual game for the time, with little personal or object interaction and considerable emphasis on exploration and scientific and mechanical initiatives, with no clear goals
 game kii safalataa kaa ek hissaa yah tha ki yah kishor purush darshakon ko apana lakshya banaata nahin lag rahaa tha lekin uske bajaay yah ek mukhyadhara vayask darshakon ko apana lakshya banaata prathit ho rahaa tha
 Mist set a record for seven years of computer game sales - nine million copies sold on all platforms - until the release of The Sims in 2000, this extraordinary feat was not defeated
 1980 ke dashak main computer ke liye taiyaar kiye gaye adventure games sab se adhik lokapriy the
 But in the mid-1990s, its popularity declined drastically, and it was replaced by action games in the American market, especially first-day shooters such as Doom and half-life, which gradually gained their hold
 The main reason for this was that the games of these games were well written and the structure was similar to Solo games
 adventure games kii lokapriyata main ai giravat ke kaaran bahut se prakashkon or games taiyaar karne waalon ke liye duusare games kaa nirmaan karne ke mukaable adventure games taiyaar karnaa ghate kaa sauda sabit hone laga
