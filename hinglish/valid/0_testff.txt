 Kannauji has its own nature
 sangya, visheshan tathaa kriya ke roopon main brajabhasha jahaan aukarantata lekar chalati he vahaan kannauji okarantata kaa anusaran karti he
 In the district Braj language of Aligarh district, if we say "" Carou Chora Bolou "", then it will be said in Kannauji that - "" Say Caro Lurika
 bhavishyatkaleen kriya kannauji main tidhntaroopini hoti he, lekin brajabhasha main vah kridantarupini pai jaati he

 This name can be given to the language spoken in the north west of Gwalior - Budeli influenced Brajbhasha
 rajasthan kii jaipuri se prabhavit brajabhasha - yah bharatpur tathaa uske dakshini bhaag main boli jaati he
 Sikarwadi Brajbhasha - This form of Brajbhasha is prevalent in the north east region of Gwalior where settlements of Sikarwad Rajputs are found

 There are settlements of Jadau Rajputs here
 kannauji se prabhavit brajabhasha - jila eta tathaa tehsil anupshahar evam atarauli kii bhashaa kannauji se prabhavit he

 Pig influenza was first known as a human-related influenza, which was discovered during the flu pandemic of 1918 when pigs, like humans, fell ill like humans

 varsh 1918 tak iskaa sahi pataa nahin chalaa
 On February 5, 1976, Fort Dix, a man in the US Army, said he felt tired and weak
 vah baad main mar gaya or baad main uske chaar saathi sainik aspataal main bhartee hue
 uski maut ke do hafte baad swasthya adhikariyon ne yah bataaya ki uski maut kaa kaaran boar kii ek nai nasl flu he
 This species was considered a variant of H1N1 called a / New Jersey / 1976
 It was discovered until 19 January and 9 February and did not spread again after Fort Dix
 yah nayi jati varsh 1918 kii flu mahamari se sambandhit jati kii tarah dikhaai detii he
 In addition, this surveillance detected another caste specific in America
 a / Victoria / 75 spread and caused illness and persisted until March
 Public health officials were alerted and then decided to prevent another major pandemic and urged President Gerald Ford to give the vaccine to all people in the United Nations
 yah tikaakaran kaarykram jansampark samasyaon or deriyon ke kaaran samay par nahin ho paae
 1 oktober 1976 ko, tikaakaran kaarykram shuru hua or 11 oktober tak, lagbhag 40 karod log, yaa aabaadi kaa lagbhag 24% ne boar flu se bachaav praapt kiya
 On the same day, three senior citizens died after receiving the swine flu vaccine and there the media tried to link those deaths to vaccination, although they found no positive evidence for this
 According to science writer Patrick Di Justo, by the time the truth was discovered that the deaths had no connection with the vaccine - it was too late
 "sarkaar ne lambey samay tak shookar flu ke bare main dar tha - to ab ve boar flu ke tikaakaran ke bare main darane lage
" is kaarykram ke liye yah ek bahut bada jhatka tha
 According to reports, people who received swine flu vaccine were found to have guillain-barré syndrome, a type of neuromuscular disorder
 yah syndrome aadhunik influenza tike kaa ek durlabh nakaaratmak asar tha jo prati das lakh logon main se ek maamla is ghatana kaa hota tha
 As a result, De Justo wrote that "the public gave up trusting in government-run health programs that killed older people and crippled young people
" By the end of 1976, at least 33% of the population received vaccines
 Had done rashtriya influenza tikaakaran kaarykram 16 disambar tak samaapt kar diya gaya
 In total, there were 500 cases of guillain-barré syndrome, out of which 25 people died of lung complications
 dow pi
 habar ke anusaar, varsh 1976 kaa yah tikaa ek tarah ke rog-nidaan tikaakaran ke kaaran utpann hua
 Other influenza vaccines have not been linked to GBS
 Those who had a history of GBS were already alerted
 pratirakshan kaarykram main bhaag lene vaale ek bhagidaar ke dwaara yah mana gaya ki is rog se zyada america vaasiyon ko is tike ne maar daalaa
 In September 1988, a swine flu virus killed one woman and infected others
 32-year-old Barbara Ann Wieners was eight months pregnant when she and her husband, Ed, went to Walworth County at a county fair named Wisconsin and fell ill
 barbara aath din baad, neumonia se maari gayi
 The only pathogen identified within it was the swine influenza virus of the H1N1 species
 doctoron ke parishram se use prerit kiya gaya or marane se pehle usne ek swasth beti ko janam diya
 uskaa pati baad main thik hua
 ILI was widely found in all the pigs displayed at the boar fair
 Out of 25 boar exhibitors, 76% of boar exhibitors who were in the age group of 9 to 19 found positive SIV antibody
 But none of this group had any serious illness
 atirikt adhyayan se yah pataa chalaa ki jo rogi swasthya karmiyon ke sampark main the unamem halkaa influenza viksit hua, vaise hi jaise boar ke pratipind ke saath bimariyon kaa sankraman hota he
 However, there was no community outbreak
 varsh 1998 main, boar flu chaar america rajyon main paae gaye
 Within a year, it spread among pig populations across the United States
 Scientists believe that the virus originated from pigs which appear as flu strains from birds and humans
 isse yah pataa chalaa ki boar ek crucible ke rup main ubhar kar aate hai jahaan nae influenza virus alag upabhedon se jeenon ke vargeekaran ke parinaam ke rup main vibhinn jatiyon main dikhaai dete hai
 On 20 August 2007, officials of the Department of Agriculture investigated the outbreak in Nueva Esija and Central Luzon, Philippines
 Death rate due to swine flu is less than 10%, unless there are complications such as hog cholera
 27 july 2007 ko, philippine rashtriya maance nirikshan seva ne boar haija ke prati "red alert" kii ghoshnaa kii, jahaan metro manila ke saath-saath bulaakaan or pumpanga ke pichhawade boar farm se yah rog lujon ke paanch praanton main fail gaya, jabaki yah swine flu ke liye nakaartmak siddh hua tha
 The 2009 flu outbreak was thought to be a new strain of the strain H1N1 that had not previously been reported in pigs
 april ke uttarardh main margaret chaan, vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke mahanideshak, ne "antarrashtriya chintaa kii ek saarvajanik swasthya apaat sthiti", kii ghoshnaa dablyuechao kii nai antarrashtriya swasthya viniyamon ke anusaar di jab H1N1 virus ke pratham maamle ke bare main sanyukt rajya america ko soochna mili
iske tahat, 2 may 2009 ko, jab mexico main iske failane kii soochna mili to yah paaya gaya ki isaki kadi alberta, canada, ke ek farm main dikhaai di
 in siiron, ne is nayi nasal ko ek majdoor se praapt kiya lagata he jo haal hi main mexico se lautaa tha or jisame influenza ke lakshan dikhaai dene lage the
 These are possible cases, which are pending confirmation in the laboratory
 yah nayi nasal kii influenza a tarah ke virus vargeekaran dwaara chaar tarah kii jatiyon se H1N1 ke upbhed se yukt hokar varnit kiye gaye hai, inamen se ek manushya se, ek pakshiyon se or do boar se aaye hai
 } Further analysis revealed that it consisted of two types of species found in pigs
 haalanki shuruaati reporton main is nayi jati ko boar influenza kaha gaya par uskaa mul abhi bhi agyaat he
 Many countries have taken several precautionary measures to treat the disease as a possibility of a global pandemic
 mrityu dar ko drushti main rakhte hue swine flu kii tulana kai anya suar flu influenza virus se kii gayi he
 "in America it seems that out of every 1000 people who get infected, 40 people have to go to hospital and one person dies
 is baat kaa bhi dar he ki boar flu sardiyon ke maheenon main ek pramukh vaishvik mahamari ban jaayegi or isliye kai desh tikaakaran abhiyaan kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Influenzae are common in pigs because more than half of the breeding pigs of pigs in the United Nations have been exposed to the virus
 is vishaanu ke antibody anya deshon main bhi aam hai
 The main cause of transmission is through direct contact between infected and uninfected animals
 ye sampark visheshkar pashu parivahan ke dauraan aam hai
 Intensive farming can also increase the risk of transmission because the pigs are very close to each other
 virus kaa sidhaa hastantaran shaayad yaa to siiron ke naak se yaa sookhe shleshm ke madhyam dwaara hota he
 Airborne infection also occurs when these pigs either cough or sneeze
 yah virus aamtaur par ek jhund ke madhyam se kuch hi dinon main bahut jaldi failata he
 Infection can also be from other wild animals
 kuch hi dinon ke bheetar sabhi siiron se sankraman failata he
 This infection can also be caused by wild boar, or wild animals that spread the disease from the farm
 jo log kukkut or siiron ke saath kaam karte hai, ve in ke gahan jokhim main aate hai
 Such people are at risk of zoonotic infection which is found in virus animals
 iske kaaran ek aabaadi ise ban sakati he jisame manushya iske vaahak ho sakate hai or inamen junosis or vargeekaran sambhav ho saktaa he
 Vaccination of these employees against influenza and surveillance against the new influenza species may be a good measure of public health
 varsh 2004 main lova vishvavidhyalay main, jo log swine ke saath kaam karte hai, ne shookar se influenza kaa manushya main sthaanantaran, par ek choti si nigaraanee adhyayan main pralekhith kiya
 The study has formed the basis, among others, that swine is a public health monitoring center for people whose jobs are based on pigs
 anya vyavsaay jinamein yah sankraman adhik hota he, ve hai, pashu chikitsak or maance prasanskaran kaaryakarta, haalanki in donon samoohon ke liye sankraman kaa khatra farm ke mazdooron se kam hota he
 Pigs are unusual because they can be infected with three different species of influenza strains: pigs, birds and humans
 This makes pigs to be carriers of the influenza virus where gene exchange as well as producing new and dangerous species 
 avian influenza virus H3N2 china ke suaron main sthanikmaari vaale he or in kii pahchaan vietnam ke siiron main bhi kii gai he, jiske kaaran nae upabhedon ke udbhav kii ashanka bad jaati he
 H3N2 evolved from antigenic to H2N2
 agast 2004 main, shodhakartaaon ne chinamen siiron main H5N1 ko paaya
 These H5N1 infections can be quite common: a survey of 10 healthy pigs revealed that the H5N1 virus was contained in a sample of five pigs when a bird flu was detected at a poultry farm in West Java
 indonesian sarkaar ko is kshetra main isi tarah ke parinaam mili
 is kshetra ke baahar 150 siiron par kiye gaye atirikt pareekshan nakaaratmak rahe
 Influenza infection in pigs causes fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and loss of appetite
 kuch maamalon main sankraman se garbhpaat bhi ho jaataa he
 Although mortality is generally low, viruses reduce weight as well as growth, causing economic losses to farmers
 sankramit siiron ke sharir kaa vajan 3 se 4 hafton kii avadhi main 12 pound se adhik kam ho jaataa he
 Direct infection of swine flu virus from pigs to humans can only occasionally be possible
 According to medical literature reports, 50 cases have been received till date from the first case registered in the year 1958, out of which six have died
 chah logon main se ek garbhvatee thi, ek ko khun kaa cancer tha, ek hodgkin kaa rogi tha or do swasth bataaye jate hai
 Although this is a low number of infections, the exact rate of infection is not known, as in most cases only very mild disease can occur, which will neither be reported or will ever be diagnosed
 centre rog niyantran or rokthaam, ke anusaar maanav main boar flu 2009 ke "H1N1 virus" influenza or influenza ke samaan beemaari kii tarah hi lagata he
 These symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headaches, chills and fatigue
 varsh 2009 ke prakope main zyaadaatar rogiyon ko dast or ulti hote dikhaai die hai
 The 2009 H1N1 virus is not zoonotic swine flu, as it is not transmitted from swine to man, person to person
 kyonki ye lakshan boar flu ke liye vishisht nahin hai
 a differential diagnosis of probable swine flu is that swine flu should show symptoms in a person that are due to that person's recent history
 udhaaharan ke liye, 2009 main sanyukt rajya main boar flu failane ke dauraan sidisi ne chikitsakon se kaha ki ve "boar flu se peedit logon ko jinamein fever ke saath-saath gambhir saans kii beemaari kii pushti hui he, ve jo swine flu ke vyaktiyon se sampark praapt kar chuke hai, jo sanyukt raashtra ke un paanch rajyon main the jahaan se swine flu se log grast hue hai, jo biimaar hone se 7 din pehle mexico main nivas kar rahe the, par vichaar karne ko kaha he"
 swine flu kii pushti ke liye prayogshaala pareekshan kii aavashyaktaa he Prevention of swine influenza has three components: prevention of swine, prevention of transmission to humans and prevention of its spread among humans
 siiron ke bich main influenza ke prasar ko rokane ke tareeke hai - prabandhan kii suvidha, jhund kaa prabandhan or tikaakaran
 kyonki adhiktar beemaari or maut boar flu se jude anya rogazanqon dwaara hoti he, tikaakaran par nirbhar niyantran aparyaapt ho sakati hai
 In recent decades it has been difficult to control swine influenza by vaccination, with the emergence of the virus making conventional vaccination inconsistent
 maanak vanijyik boar flu tikon ke sankraman ko niyantrit karne main prabhavi hote hai, jab virus upbhed mahatvapurn sangrakshan ke liye paryaapt he or vishisht virus ke dwaara banaayi gayi davaaiyaan jatil maamalon main prayog kii jaati hai
 Vaccines designed for SIV control and prevention are used for SIV vaccination in swine firms that are commercially available in the United States
 haal hi main jo 97 H3N2 pruthak rakhe gayi virason kaa jaanch kiya gaya to yah paaya gaya ki unamem se 41 virus shaktisaali hai or inamen teen virdohi pratikriyaayein hai
 The protective potential of influenza vaccines depends largely on the close association between the vaccine virus and the pandemic virus, with the ineffective H3N2 variants located in the SIV suggesting that current commercial vaccines cannot effectively protect pigs from H3N2 infection viruses
 sanyukt rajya krishi vibhaag ke shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki jab tak suar tikaakaran se boar biimaar hote rahenge tab tak yah sankraman rukta nahin he
 Facility management includes controlling the virus existing in the environment as well as creating an insect-resistant environment
 yah virus do saptaah se zyada jivit koshikaon ke baahar ji nahin saktaa he, lekin thand main, keitanurahit vaataavaran main yah sust pad jaataa he
 Herd management does not mean the inclusion of pigs carrying influenza in the herd that have been exposed to the virus
 yah virus swasth siiron main 3 maheene tak rahata he or in main se prakope ke samay baraamad kiya ja saktaa he
 Carrier pigs are usually responsible for introducing SIV into uninfected herds or in the country so that new animals are kept separately from them
 After its spread, disease outbreaks power in infected pigs decreases, so its outbreak increases
 suar influenza, maanav influenza or avian influenza donon upabhedon se ho saktaa he, ye in pratijani ke vaahak ho jate hai jo ek nae influenza kii jati ko paidaa kar sakate hai
 The transfer from pigs to humans occurs mainly in farms where farmers are in close contact with pigs
 yadhyapi boar influenza kii jatiyaan aamtaur par manushyon ko sankramit karne main sakasham nahin he par yah kabhi-kabhi sambhav ho jaataa he, isliye kisaanon or pashu chikitsakon ko chehre par mukhauta daal kar sankramit pashuon se nipatna chahie
 boar par tikon kaa upyog, sankraman ko rokane ke liye, maanav main prasaaran hone se bachane kii ek pramukh vidhi he
 Risk factors that contribute to infection from swine to humans are smoking and non-wearing of gloves when working with animals
 manushyon ke bich sankraman, khansane yaa chheenkne or logon dwaara vishaanu yukt vastuon ko chune se or phir apni naak yaa munh ko chune se failata he
 Swine flu cannot be spread by pork products, as viruses are not transmitted through food
 manushya main swine flu pehle paanch din ke dauraan zyada sankramit hote hai, haalanki kuch log, adhiktar bacchon main, yah sankraman das din ke liye bhi rah saktaa he
 For diagnosis, samples can be collected and sent for analysis within the first five days
 manushyon ke bich main is vishaanu ke prasar ko rokane ke liye influenza ke khilaaf maanak sankraman ke niyantran kaa prayog bhi kar sakate hai
 When going to public places, soap and water should be used with alcohol mixed hand-washing
 To prevent infection, all items in the house have to be disinfected, which may be possible with a thin chlorine bleach
 haalanki yah trisanyojak influenza tikaa nae 2009 H1N1 jati ke khilaaf sangrakshan pradaan karne ke liye, sakasham nahin he
 Vaccines are being developed against the new breed and they will be ready by June 2009
 visheshgyon kii raay he ki haath kii dhulaai se viral sankraman kaa rokthaam hota he, jisame saadhaaran influenza or boar flu virus bhi sammilit hai
 Influenza is spread by coughing or sneezing, but according to the evidence obtained, tiny droplets form the virus on the table, on the telephone and other surfaces and are passed through the fingers to the mouth, nose, or eyes
 madh yukt fom yaa jail se haath dhone se virus or jeevanu nasht ho jate hai
 If any person has any flu-like symptoms like sudden fever, cough or muscle pain, they should stay away from work or away from public transport and contact the doctor
 saamaajik taur se dur rahanaa bhi ek or tarika he
 This means staying away from people who may be infected, avoiding going to large conferences, doing little work, staying home and staying in bed if the infection is spreading in a community
 saarvajanik swasthya or anya jimmedaar adhikari unako dur rahane kaa anurodh kar sakate hai yaa samaaj se dur rahane ko bhi kah sakate hai yadi beemaari kaa failana gambhir dikhaai de rahaa he
 Swine influenza, as it is said, is not fatal to pigs, requiring little treatment and care
 iske bajaay pashu chikitsa ke prayaas formon or anya formon par kendrit rahete hai
 Vaccination and animal management techniques are of paramount importance for these efforts
 iske upachaar ke liye antibiotics kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he, jinka asar influenza virus par nahin hota, influenza yukt kamjor jhund par bacterial nimonia or anya madhyamik sankraman ko rokane main madad karte hai
 If a person becomes ill with swine flu, anti-virus drugs reduce the disease and the patient feels increasingly better
 ve flu kii gambhir jatiltaaon kaa rokthaam bhi kar sakate hai
 For the treatment, anti-virus drugs work best if started immediately after the onset of the disease
 In addition to antiviral drugs at home or hospital, palliative care can be used to control fever and balance fluids
 america centre rog niyantran or rokthaam ne tamiflu yaa railenza ke upyog kii sifarish kii he, jo swine flu virus ke sankraman yaa rokthaam ke liye upyogi siddh hota he
 But most people who are infected with this virus get cured without using medical or anti-virus drugs
 jo virus 2009 main failaa vah amantadaine or rimantadine ke prati pratirodhi he
 In the US, on 27 April 2009, the Food and Drug Administration issued an authorization for emergency use to provide anti-ralenza and anti-tamiflu virus drugs that are necessary for the treatment of swine flu and which are not yet approved

 hriday dhamni bypass shalya-kriya, bypass surgery, hriday bypass, aadi naamon se prasiddh ye shalya kriya hriday ko rakt pahunchane vaali 3 dhamniyon kii shalya kriya ko kehete hai
 Some obstruction in the heart artery is called heart artery disease
 yah rukaawat vasa ke jamaav hone se hoti he, jisase dhamni kathor ho jaati he va rakt ke nirbaadh bahaav main rukaawat aati he
 Heart failure results in heart failure, increased blood pressure, increased heart muscle and weakened heart
 yadi samay par ilaaj ho to bachaa ja saktaa he
 In the event of complete closure of the artery, the risk of heart attack increases
 hriday kii teen mukhya dhamniyon main se kisi bhi ek yaa sabhi main avrodh paidaa ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, the vein is removed from any part of the body by surgery and it is added parallel to the stopped place of the artery of the heart
 yah nai jodi hui nas dhamni main rakt pravaah pun: chaalu kar detii he
 This surgical technique is called bypass surgery
 praayah chaati ke andar se mameri artery yaa haath se redial artery yaa pair se safenus wain nikaalkar hriday kii dhamni se jodi jaati he
 This action does not remove the old stunted artery, but instead a new vein is added in front of the block or blockage in the same artery, thereby smooth the blood flow again
 dhamni rukaawat ke maamle main bypass surgery sarvshereshth vikalp hot he
 Another and cheaper option is angioplasty
 hriday kii kisi ek dhamni main avrodh hone par praayah angeoplasty se samaadhaan ho saktaa he

 Wash the heart with a solution that lowers its temperature and stops beating it
 uske baad graphting kaary kiya jaataa he
 For this, graft of vein or abdominal artery of hand or foot is prepared and kept
 ise aavashyaktaanusaar bypass grapht kar diya jaataa he
 After this, the heart and lungs connect back to the circulatory system, so that they start working as before
 heart langs mashin ko hataa lete hai, va hriday kii sataha par do pesamekar ke taar laga dete hai
 Connect the pacemaker's wires to the temporary pacemaker
 hriday kii dhadkan ke aniyamit hone par yah pesamekar use niyantrit kar letaa he
 The bones of the chest are stitched firmly into the skin and stitches are attached to the skin
 yah aaparishan teen-chaar ghante kii avadhi kaa ho saktaa he or is bich rogi ko chaar se chah unit tak rakt chadhaanaa pad saktaa he
 For the next 24 to 48 hours after the operation, the patient is kept in intensive care unit under the supervision of physician and nurse etc

 a cannula is placed in an artery which keeps the patient's blood pressure checked and the other one is in the vein of the cannula and it shows the pressure inside the vein
 rogi kii chaati main bhi do nalee lagi hoti hai jinase chaati ke bheetar ekatra ho rahaa dravya baahar aata rahata he
 All these tubes are removed one day after operation
 inke alaava aaparishan ke 16 se 24 ghante baad tak rogi kii saans nalee main ek andotracial taub lagi rahati he
 This tube is connected to the artificial respirator and helps the patient in respiration
 jab rogi acchhee tarah saans lene lagata he to ise hataa diya jaataa he
 As long as this tube is in the respiratory tract, the patient can neither eat or drink or talk
 rogi ke munh or naak par ek oxigen mask bhi laga rahata he, taaki rogi ko paryaapt maatra main oxigen milti rahe
 Often, the patient is superannuated from the hospital within 1-2 weeks of the operation
 tab tak uski chaati or pair ke jakhm bhi suukh jate hai
 Due to the removal of the vein from the foot, the foot may remain swollen for a few days
 lekin pair upar uthaakar aaraam karne or chalate samay pair par crap bandes baandhne se sujan kam ho jaati he
 Initially, the bypass action was performed by stopping the heartbeat
 isse duusare angon jaise, gurde, yakrut, fefda aadi par vipareet prabhaav padataa tha
 The modern new method, called beating heart surgery, prevents the flow of blood only to the heart where the surgery is to be performed
 purv vidhi main hriday ke apressant main saat-aath unit rakt kii chahie hoti thi, jabaki beating heart surgery main ek se do unit rakt kaaphi rahata he

 Now there is no need for long tearing
 is takanic kii visheshta yah he ki ise hriday ke upree bhaag par lagaakar isse hriday ko aavashyaktaanusaar ghumaya ja saktaa he
 For this reason, it has become easy to see the back and side parts of the heart with the minimally invasive technique
 is takanic main heart-langs mashin kii bhi aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 There is a small cut in the chest compared to open heart surgery, which is not bad to see
 cat chota hone se rakt-srav bhi bahut kam hota he or teen se chaar din main rogi waapas ghar ja sakate hai
 After this, the need for repeat operation is almost nil and its expenditure is also 50-60 thousand rupees less than the old open-heart technique
 jin rogiyon kaa hriday hridayaghat se kaaphi kshatigrast hua he, unke alaava sabhi ke liye, khaskar vridhon va madhumeh rogiyon ke liye ye takanic kargar hoti he
 According to experts, yoga is beneficial at the first level in cardiovascular diseases but doing yoga after angioplasty and bypass surgery can be harmful

 yah ek dohare uddeshy vaali ikai he jo multi stage flash aswan kaa prayog karti he or prati varsh 300 million ghan meter pani kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham he
 In comparison, the largest desalination plant in the United States is in Tempa Bay, Florida, and operated by Tempa Bay Water, which began desalination of 34
7 million cubic meters of water per year in December 2007
 tempa be sanyantr, jebel ali diselination plant ke 12 % utpaadan par hi sanchalit ho rahaa he 17 janvari 2008 ko, wal street jarnal ke ek lekh main likhaa tha, "antarrashtriya diselination association ke anusaar, duniya bhar main 13,080 diselination sanyantr prati din 12 billian galen se adhik pani kaa utpaadan karte hai
 " in sanyantron main prayukt hone vaali paaramparik prakriya nirvaat aswan he - anivaary rup se kam vayumandaleey dabaav main pani ko ubaalte hai or is prakaar saamaanya se kahin kam taapmaana praapt hota he
 This is because the fluid boils only when the vapor pressure becomes equal to the surrounding pressure and the vapor pressure increases further with temperature
 is prakaar, kam taapmaana ke kaaran, urja kii bachat kii jaati he
 Multi-stage flash distillation, a leading distillation method, accounted for 85% of the world's total production in 2004
 diselination ke liye pramukh pratispardhi prakriyaayein, reverse osmosis prodyogiki dwaara membrane kaa prayog karti hai
 Membrane processes use semi-impermeable membrane and pressure to remove salt from water
 reverse osmosis sanyantr membrane pranali aam taur par thermal aswan se kam urja kaa prayog karte hai, jisase pichley ek dashak main sampoorn diselination laagat main kami ai he
 However, desalination energy will remain dense, and future costs will depend on both energy and desalination technology
 kozenreshan ek aisi prakriya he, jisamen bijli ke utpaadan main utpann hone vaali atirikt urja ko kisi or kaary ko puraa karne ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 In the perspective of desalination, sea water or brackish groundwater in cogeneration is converted into potable water by an integrated or "dual purpose" unit, with the power plant being used as an energy source for the desalination process 
 ikai kaa urja utpaadan puri tarah se pine yogya pani ko samarpit ho saktaa he, yaa atirikt urja kaa utpaadan kiya ja saktaa he or ise urja grid main prayukt kiya ja saktaa he 
 kozenreshan ke vibhinn prakaar hai or siddhanthata urja utpaadan ke kisi bhi prakaar kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 However, most current and future cogeneration desalination plants use fossil fuels or nuclear power as their source of energy
 adhikansh sanyantr madhya purv yaa uttari africa main unke petroleum sansadhano tathaa kar mukt chhot ke kaaran sthit hai
 Dual-purpose units have the advantage that they can be more efficient in energy consumption, making desalination a more viable option for drinking water in low-water areas

 Large-scale nuclear-powered desalination may be more economical
 jabaki dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki laagat kam ho rahi he or aam taur par samrudh kshetra, jo ki mahasaagaron ke nikat hai, ke liye praudyogiki aam taur par sakaaratmak he, ek adhyayan kaa tark he ki "kam pani vaale kuch kshetron ke liye diselination ek samaadhaan ho saktaa he, kintu garib, mahadweep ke aantarik bhaagon main sthit, yaa adhik oonchai par sthit sthanon ke liye yah samaadhaan nahin he
 And unfortunately, these places also include some places where there are severe water problems and "in fact, the cost of plating water up to 2000 meters or sending water up to 1600 km is equal to the cost of desalination
 is prakaar, diselination kii tulana main kahin or se tazaa pani dho kar laana adhik kifayati ho saktaa he
 In places away from the sea, such as New Delhi, or in high places such as Mexico City, higher transportation rates will increase desalination costs
 Desalinated water is also expensive in those places which are away from the sea as well as at altitudes such as Riyadh and Harare
 In many places, the desalination process is more expensive than the transportation cost, so in coastal cities such as Beijing, Bangkok, Zaragoza, Phoenix and, apparently Tripoli, the process will be relatively inexpensive
 "200 miles after desalination in Jubail, Saudi Arabia , Water is pumped through the pipeline to the Riyadh Capital Region
 200 mile tateey shaharon ke liye, diselination ko teji se ek aprayukt or aseemit pani ke strot ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 However, desalination does not take into account the basic essential elements of water recycling and broken
 Water is reused in Fountain Valley, CA, Fairfax, VA, El Paso, TX and Scottsdale, AZ
 yah prakriya diselination kaa ek vikalp he jisame namak kii kam maatra ke kaaran 50% kam urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or yah diselinated samudri pani kii tulana main 30% kam laagat par upabhoktaaon ke liye taaze pani kaa utpaadan karata he, samudri jivan or paristhitiki pranaaliyon ko nuksaan pahunchaae bina, jo diselination sanyantron ke liye saamaanya chiz he
 Israel is desalinating water at a cost of US $ 0

 Many large coastal cities in developed countries are considering the feasibility of seawater desalination due to lower cost than other water supply options, including mandatory installation of rainwater harvesting tanks or water from waves
 May include the option of infrastructure development

 Since 2006, the city of Perth has been successfully operating a reverse osmosis seawater desalination plant and the Western Australian Government has announced that a second plant will be built to meet the city's needs
 a desalination plant is being built in Australia's largest city, Sydney, and the Wonthaggi desalination plant in Wonthaggi, Victoria is a proposed unit
 perth diselination sanyantr ko aanshik rup se iemyu douns wind farm se praapt akshay urja dwaara sanchalit kiya ja rahaa he
 The Sydney plant will be operated entirely from renewable sources, thereby eliminating environmentally harmful greenhouse gas emissions, a common argument against desalination of seawater for the technology's energy needs
 bijli se chalane vaali diselination sanyantron ke liye akshay urja kii kharid yaa utpaadan se swaabhaavik rup se puunji / yaa diselination kii sanchaalan laagat main vruddhi hoti he
 However, recent experiences in Perth and Sydney indicate that the additional cost is acceptable to the public, as the city can then argue that it is a water supply occurring without harming the surrounding environment
 queensland rajya sarkaar ne haal hi main ghoshnaa kii ki gold coast diselination sanyantr puri tarah se akshay sroton se sanchalit kiya jayega, jisase paryaavaran ko kam kshati hogi, jisase yah perth or sidney main sanchalit hone vaale pramukh sanyantron ke samaan kaam karegaa
 In December 2007, the South Australian government announced that it would build a marine desalination plant in Port Stanwak, Adelaide City, Australia
 The system of finance for the desalination plant will be recovered by increasing water prices
 An online, unscientific survey showed that about 60% of the vote was in favor of increased water rates for desalination
 17 janvari 2008 ke waal street jarnal ke lekh main likhaa he, " november main connectikat main sthit ricikal resorces corp

 By producing 50 million gallons of fresh water per day, the unit will be the largest in the Western Hemisphere, enough to supply about 100,000 homes 


 Desalination costs have halved in the last decade due to advanced technology Due to which competition has increased more
 

 pisaiden kii yojana prati acre foot lagbhag 950 US$ kii laagat se pani bechney kii he
 This compares to the US $ 700 per acre foot that local agencies currently pay for water
