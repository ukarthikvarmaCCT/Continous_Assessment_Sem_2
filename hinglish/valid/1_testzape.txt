 Goa's long history dates back to the third century BCE when the Maurya dynasty rule was established here

 As per Indian citizenship and nationality law: Constitution of India provides sole citizenship for the entire country
 samvidhan ke prarambh main naagarikta se sambandhit praavdhaanon ko bharat ke samvidhan ke bhaag II main anuchhed 5 se 11 main diya gaya he
 The relevant Indian law is the Citizenship Act 1955, as amended by the Citizenship Act 1986, Citizenship Act 1992, Citizenship Act 2003 and Citizenship Ordinance 2005, the Citizenship Act 2003 was approved by the President of India on 7 January 2004 and 3 It came into existence in December 2004
 naagarikta adhyadesh 2005 ko bharat ke raashtrapati dwaara prakhyapit kiya gaya tha or yah 28 june 2005 ko astitv main aayaa
 Following these reforms, the Indian nationality law largely follows the Juice Sanguinis, in contrast to the Juice Soli
 26 janvari 1950 ke baad parantu 1 july 1947 se pehle bharat main janma koi bhi vyakti janm ke dwaara bharat kaa naagarik he
 Any person born in India on or after 1 July 1947 is a citizen of India if one of his parents at the time of his birth was a citizen of India
 7 janvari 2004 ke baad bharat main paidaa hua vah koi bhi vyakti bharat kaa naagarik mana jaataa he, yadi uske donon abhibhavak bharat ke naagarik hon athwa yadi ek abhibhavak bhartiya ho or doosraa abhibhavak uske janm ke samay par gaiyr kanoonee apravasi na ho, to vah naagarik bhartiya yaa videshi ho saktaa he
 Persons born outside India after 26 January 1950 but before 10 December 1992 are citizens of India by descent if their father was a citizen of India at the time of their birth
 10 disambar 1992 ko yaa iske baad bharat main paidaa hua vyakti bharat kaa naagarik he yadi uske janm ke samay koi ek abhibhavak bharat kaa naagarik tha
 From 3 December 2004 onwards, a person born outside India will not be considered a citizen of India if their birth is not registered with the Indian Consulate within a period of one year after birth
 In certain circumstances, registration can be done after a period of 1 year with the permission of the Central Government
 ek bhartiya vaanijya duutavas main ek avyask bachche ke janm ke panjikaran ke liye aavedan dene ke saath abhibhavakon ko likhit main upkram ko yah bataanaa hota he ki is bachche ke paas kisi or desh kaa passport nahin he
 The Central Government, on application, can register a person as a citizen of India under Section 5 of the Citizenship Act 1955 if it falls under one of the following categories: - ek videshi naagarik sameekaran ke dwaara bharat kii naagarikta praapt kar saktaa he jo baarah saal se bharat main rah rahaa ho
 iske liye aavashyak he ki aavedak 7 saal kii avadhi main kul 4 saal ke liye bharat main rahaa ho or aavedan se pehle usne 12 maheene kaa samay bharat main vyateet kiya ho
 On 26 November 1949, the people domiciled in the territory of India automatically became citizens of India as per the consistent provisions of the Indian Constitution
 
bhartiya samvidhan ne pakistan ke un kshetron se aane vaale apravasiyon kii naagarikta ke sambandh main bhi praavdhaan banaaye hai, jo vibhaajan se pehle bharat kaa hissaa the
 The renunciation of citizenship is covered under section 8 of the Citizenship Act 1955
 yadi ek vayask bhartiya naagarikta ke tyaag kii ghoshnaa karata he, vah bhartiya naagarikta kho detaa he
 Also from the date of renunciation, the minor child of such person also loses Indian citizenship
 jab baccha atharah saal kii umr main pahunchataa he, use phir se bhartiya naagarikta praapt karne kaa adhikaar hota he
 The declaration of renunciation under the Indian citizenship law requires that the person making the declaration be "full of age and ability"
 naagarikta kii samaapti ko naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 9 main cover kiya gaya he
 The provisions for termination are different and differentiated from the provision for declaration of renunciation
 adhinium kii dhara 9 ke anusaar bharat kaa koi bhi naagarik jo panjikaran yaa sameekaran ke dwaara kisi or desh kii naagarikta praapt kar letaa he, uski bhartiya naagarikta radd ho jaaegi
 isamen yah bhi praavdhaan he ki bharat kaa koi bhi naagarik jo swechha se kisi duusare desh kii naagarikta praapt kar letaa he, uski bhartiya naagarikta radd ho jaayegi
vishesh rup se, samaapti kaa praavdhaan tyaag ke praavdhaan se alag he, kyonki yah "bharat ke kisi bhi naagarik " par lagu hota he or vayaskon ke liye hi pratibandhit nahin he
 That is why Indian children also automatically lose their Indian citizenship if at any time after their birth they acquire citizenship of another country, for example, by equation or registration - whether any other citizenship is acquired by the child's parents
 Why not be the result of the action of naagarikta niyam 1956 ke anusaar kisi or desh kaa passport praapt karnaa bhi us desh kii rashtriyata kaa svaichhik adhigrahan he
 According to Rule 3 of Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, "the fact that a citizen of India has on some date obtained a passport from the government of another country will be conclusive proof that he has voluntarily granted the citizenship of that country Is derived from " ek baar phir se, yah niyam lagu hota he yadi bachche ke liye uske abhibhavakon ke dwaara videshi passport praapt kiya gaya he or chaahe is tarah ke passport ko praapt karnaa kisi anya desh ke kanoonon ke anusaar aavashyak ho, jo bachche ko apana ek naagarik maanata he 
 isse koi fark nahin padataa ki us vyakti ke paas abhi bhi bhartiya passport he
 a person who acquires another citizenship loses Indian citizenship from the same day he acquired the citizenship or passport of another country
 british rajanyik padon ke liye ek prachlit abhyaas he, udahaaran ke liye, us aavedakon se bhartiya passport ko zabt kar bhartiya praadhikaranon ko lautaa diya jaye, jo british passport ke liye aavedan karte hai, yaa jinhone ise praapt kar liya he
 There are special rules for Indian citizens regarding Goa, Daman and Diu
 naagarikta niyam, 1956 kii anusuchee ke niyam 3A ke anusaar, "ek vyakti jo naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 7 ke tahat jari, daadaraa or nagar haveli aadesh 1962, athwa goa, daman or div aadesh 1962 ke aadhaar par bhartiya naagarik ban gaya he or uske paas kisi anya desh ke dwaara jari kiya yaa passport he, tathy ki usne 19 janvari 1963 se pehle apana passport nahin lautaaya he, yah is baat kaa nirnaayak pramaan hoga ki usne is dinaank se pehle swechha se us desh kii naagarikta ko praapt kar liya he
 On 16 February 1962, the Bench of the Supreme Court of India stated in the case of Izhar Ahmed Khan v
 Union of India that "if it is found that the person has acquired foreign citizenship by equation or registration, there is no doubt that As a result of type equation or registration, he will no longer be a citizen of India
 yah bhartiya rashtriyata kaa ek rup he, jiske dharak ko bharat kaa videshi naagarik kaha jaataa he
 The Indian constitution rejects dual citizenship or dual nationality, exceptions from the point where minor citizenship is obtained spontaneously
 bhartiya praadhikaranon ne is kanoon kii vyakhya kii he ki ek vyakti kisi duusare desh kaa passport nahin rakh saktaa agar uske paas bhartiya passport he- yahaan tak ki ek bachche ke maamle main jise anya desh ke dwaara uskaa naagarik hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he or aisa ho saktaa he ki us desh ke kanoonon ke anusaar us bachche ko videsh yatra karne ke liye us desh ke passport kii aavashyaktaa ho - or bhartiya adaalaton ne is maamle par kaaryakari shakha vistrut vivek diya he
 Therefore, the foreign citizenship of India is not a full citizenship of India and thus it denies dual citizenship or dual nationality
 bharat kii kendriya sarkaar ek vyakti ko aavedan par, bharat ke ek videshi naagarik ke rup main panjikrut kar sakati he yadi vah vyakti bhartiya mul kaa he or aise desh se he jo kisi ek yaa anya rup main dohari naagarikta kii anumati detaa he
 Broadly speaking, "a person of Indian origin" is a citizen of another country who: dhyaan den ki bhartiya mata pita ke bachche swatah hi in aavashyaktaaon ko puraa nahin karte or isliye swatah osiai ke paatr nahin hai
 Indian Missions have been authorized to grant foreign citizenship of India within 30 days in cases where no serious crime is involved such as drug trafficking, moral turpitude, terrorist activities or any activities that have caused more than one year There can be jail
 videshi bhartiya naagarikta un logon ko nahin di ja sakati, jinhone videshi rashtriyata ko praapt kiya he, yaa praapt karne kii yojana bana rahen hai, athwa unke paas bhartiya passport bhi he
 This law requires that an Indian national who takes a foreign nationality must immediately return his / her Indian passport
 Those who are eligible for it can apply for registration of foreign Indian citizenship
 bharat ke videshi nagarikon ko bhartiya passport karne kii koi yojana nahin he, haalanki panjikaran kaa praaanpatr passport jaisi pustika main hoga mantriparishad ne bharat ke panjikrut videshi nagarikon ko biometric smart card dene ke prastaav par kaam karne ke liye bhartiya videsh mantralay ko dishanirdesh bhi die hai
 a foreign national of India can enjoy all the rights and privileges available to non-nris on the basis of parity
 isamen krishi evam vriksharopan sampatti main nivesh karne yaa saarvajanik karyaalay rakhane kaa adhikaar shaamil nahin he
 a person is required to keep his existing foreign passport which should include a new visa called a 'U' visa, which is a multi-purpose, multi-entry, visa and lasts a lifetime
 iske saath bharat kaa videshi naagarik kabhi bhi, kisi bhi prayojan ke liye, kitni bhi samay avadhi ke liye desh kaa daura kar saktaa he
 a Vietnamese citizen of India will not be able to enjoy the following rights even while living in India: Right to vote, President's office, Vice President's office, Supreme Court and High Court judges, members of Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, Vidhan Sabha or Legislative Council The right to become, the right to appoint in public services
 Also, foreign nationals of India are not eligible for inner line permit
 If they want to travel to some special places in India, they have to apply for a protected area permit
 ek dilachasp sawaal yah he ki bharat ke videshi naagarik ke rup main panjikrut ek vyakti bharat main rahete hue apane desh ke rajanyik sangrakshan kaa adhikaar kho degaa
1930 ke rashtriyata kanoon ke sangharsh se sambandhit vishesh sawaalon par hegg sammelan kaa anuchhed 4 kahata he ki "ek rajya apane kisi vyakti ko aise rajya ke khilaaf rajanyik sangrakshan pradaan nahin kar saktaa jisaki rashtriyata aise vyaktiyon ke paas bhi ho
 yah maamla do chizon par nirbhar karata he: pehla, kya bharat kii sarkaar bharat ke videshi naagarikta ko sachhee naagarikta maanati he or is aadhaar par duusare desh ke dwaara rajanyik sangrakshan kaa adhikaar samaapt ho jaataa he; or doosraa, kya vyakti kaa apana desh ise pahachaanata he or bharat kii asweekruti ko sweekaar karata he
 Both points are questionable
 bharat videshi nagarikon ko ek swatantra yatra dastavej nahin detaa he parantu iske bajaay duusare desh ke passport main ek vija rakh detaa he
 If a person is only eligible to hold a passport from another country but cannot retain any form of Indian travel document, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the person is the only citizen of another country for the purpose of diplomatic protection
 bharat kii videshi naagarikta praapt karne par, british naagarik 1981 ke british rashtriyata adhinium kii dhara 4B ke tahat purna british naagarik ke rup main panjikaran nahin karvaa sakate
 yah unhen ek alag tareeke se purna british naagarikta praapt karne se nahin roak saktaa or yah unki british naagarikta ko radd nahin karata yadi ve dhara 4B ke tahat pehle se panjikrut hai
 The Public Information Bureau of India issued a press release which on 29 June 2005 clarified India's foreign citizenship scheme
 osiai yojana kaa purna vivaran bharat sarkaar ke grih mantralay web pej par uplabdh he
 Many other articles have also been written, including: osiai card bhartiya vija kaa vikalp nahin he or isliye osiai dharakon ko bharat main yatra karte samay vah passport apane paas rakhana chahie jo jivan bhar ke vija ko darshata he
 Although a dual citizenship is not fully developed, an OCI card holder has the privilege that multinational companies currently prefer to hire an OCI card holder for a multi-purpose and multi-entry lifetime tour of India
 Have a visa
 yah card dharak ko ek aaajeevan vija pradaan karata he, iske alaava ve alag se kaam karne kaa permit bhi praapt kar lete hai
 OCI holders are treated like nris in economic, financial and educational matters and do not have only political rights, do not have the right to purchase agricultural and plantation property or hold public office
 They do not even have to undergo registration with the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer on arrival in the country and can stay here for as long as they want
 osiai card dharak aaraam se yatra kar sakate heim or bharat main kaam le sakate hai, jabaki anya ko rojgaar vija par beurocratic deree hone par pakadaa ja saktaa he
 Many companies are following an active policy of PIO migration to expand their business
 bhartiya mishan osiai aavednon ke sakshi hai, puri duniya main vaanijya duutavas ke dwaara jari kiye gaye asankhya osiai card bhartiya vaanijya duutavas ke saath teji se bad rahen hai, isamen kaaphi sankhya main aavedan kiye ja rahe hai
 Any person who currently has a non-indian passport who can authenticate their Indianness up to three generations ago
 yahi niyam ek bhartiya naagarik ke jivan saathi par or bhartiya mul ke vyaktiyon par lagu hota he
 Citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries are not eligible to obtain a card of Indian origin as specified by the Central Government
 ek piaio card aam taur par jari hone kii tithi se pandrah varsh kii avadhi tak vaidya hota he
 This gives the holder the following advantages
 ek piaio card dharak: Before 1 January 1949, Indians were subject to the British under United Nations law
 dekhen british rashtriyata kanoon
 1 janvari 1949 or 25 janvari 1950 ke bich, bhartiya naagarikta ke bina british ke adheen rahete the, jab tak ve pehle se sanyukt raashtra or upniveshon yaa anya rashtramandal deshon kii naagarikta praapt nahin kar lete the
 When the Indian Constitution came into force on 26 January 1950, under the British Nationality Act, a person who became an Indian citizen also had the status of a Commonwealth citizen in terms of Indian membership of the Commonwealth and his Indian citizenship
 However, innumerable Indians did not obtain Indian citizenship when the Indian Constitution came into force and they remained under the British without citizenship status until they acquired citizenship of another Commonwealth country
 Any person who is subject to only one British will automatically lose British subordination after acquiring Indian citizenship or any other nationality including Indian foreign citizenship
 british ke adheen log sanyukt raashtra main na rahete hue bhi british rashtriyata adhinium kii dharaa 4B ke tahat british naagarik ke rup main panjikaran karvaa sakate hai yadi unke paas koi or rashtriyata yaa naagarikta nahin he or unhone 4 july 2002 ke baad kisi naagarikta yaa rashtriyata kaa swechha se tyaag nahin kiya he
 This facility is available from 30 April 2003 onwards
 ve log jo sanyukt raashtra main pravasit ho gaye hai, unke paas british naagarikta praapt karne kaa ek atirikt vikalp hota he, jise aamtaur par praathamikta di jaati he kyonki ve sthaanantaran yogya british naagarikta uplabdh dete hai
 The meaning of the term British subjugation changed from 1949, it is now more than a person holding citizenship of a Commonwealth country
 keval usee vyakti ko british passport diya jaataa tha jo bina naagarikta ke british ke adheen he
 See the British subject vartmaan main prayek duutavas ke apane maanak or niyam hai, jinka niyantran nayi dilli main kiya jaataa he, iske liye prakriya samaan he
 There is a lack of clarity in the application process for OCI
 aisa koi nirdhaarit prakashit samay nahin he jab aavedak ko anumodan mil jayega yaa use aavedan kii sahi sthiti kaa gyaan ho jayega
online aavedan buniyadi prakriya he, poochi gayi jaankaree dekar sambandhit stambh bharen, aavedan form kaa print len, jab aap sabamit batan ko clic karenge, yah pej gaayab ho jaayegaa or aapako form ko phir se bharna hoga
 sabhi stambh bharne ke baad form par hastakshar karen, iske baad aavedan ko osiai prabhag, dilli yaa epararo yaa nikatatam duutavas / vaanijya duutavas / ucch ayog ko bhej den
 aamtaur par agar aap dilli main aavedan karen to ek maah main aapako yah mil jaataa he
 This may vary among embassies, as all applications are finally approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs in Delhi
 kai maamalon main samay lag saktaa he kyoki agar adhikariyon ko zarurat mahasoos ho to osiai ko gahan satyaapan ke baad hi jari kiya jaataa he
 But it usually takes less than the immigrant visa approval time of the United States / United Nations or other Western countries
 america main bharat ke vaanijya duutavas general ne osiai aavednon kii handlling ko macers ko outsource karne kaa faisla kiya he trovisa outsorcing kii is prakriya ke behatar hone kii ummid he

 The literature of Telugu is very rich and ancient
 isamen kavy, upanyaas, naatak, laghukathaayen, tathaa puraana aate hai
 The tradition of Telugu literature dates back to the early 11th century when the Mahabharata was translated from Sanskrit into Telugu by Nannayya
 vijaynagar samrajya ke samay yah pallavit-pushpit hui
 Nowadays Telugu literature is divided into the following four periods - kuch log telegu sahitya kaa vibhaajan nimnlikhit virgon main bhi karte hai- Literature of any language begins in the form of songs before the script
 geet, sahitya kii tarah sthaayee nahin hote
 The appearance of the Telugu script is considered to have been 800 years before Christ
 lekin us kaal kaa sahitya lipibaddh nahin he
 Thereafter some Telugu literature is found in the inscriptions
 uske purv gitsahitya ke prachlan hone kaa anumaan kiya ja saktaa he
 The written literature of Telugu is found from the beginning of 11th century AD
 telegu ke adikavi nannay bhatta ne sanskrit mahabharat kaa anuwaad telegu padya main kiya
 Despite being a translation, it appears as an independent work
 style sanskritshabdabahula tathaa komal he
 He composed a Telugu grammar book in the Sanskrit words by the name of "andhra word Chintamani"
 yah ek anokhi ghatana he ki telegu ke adikavi hi is bhashaa ke pratham vaiyaakaran siddh hue
 Being the author of grammar, he became known as "vaganushasan"
 unke keval aadi evam sabhaparv purna or aranyaparv ke kuch bhaag milte hai
 In the Telugu country, it seems that it is difficult to become a simple and melodious poet without reading Nannay's work

 [[shrenee:hindu dharm Operant conditioning is sensitive to behavior, or controlled by its consequences, which is a learning process

 For example, rallying a child with the sight of a colored wrapper or a child's trembling with the sound of a door slam, which the angry parent signals

 a cat can escape from the box by a simple reaction such as pulling a rope or pushing a pole, but cats take a long time to get out when first constrained
 
 With repeated tests ineffective reactions occurred less frequently and successful responses occurred more often, so cats escaped more and more rapidly

 Human is now like the process studied by Thorndick called conditioning, through which many appear to learn simple behavior
 ve pratikul prabhaav kaa utpaadan jab ve nahin he, yaa ki jab pratikriyaaon ve ek safal parinaam ke liye netritv jab barkaraar rakhaa he or khaarij kar rahe hai, he
 This is usually without being planned by any "teacher", but conditioning has been used by parents in teaching their children for thousands of years
 skinner ko praayah condishning ke janak ke rup main janaa jaataa he According to Skinner's proactive adaptation theory, the consequences of behavior affect the probability of action
 ek vyavhaar jiske pashchaat ek sukhadaayak uddipak judaa hua ho, uske baar-baar hone kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he, lekin yadi doosraa vyavhaar kisi dandatmak uddipak se judaa ho to uske hone kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he

 Hierarchy, hierarchy or padosopan is a configuration of objects in which objects are placed 'up', 'down', or 'on the same level' relative to each other
 ye vasteen naam, maan, shrenee aadi ho sakati hai
 For the efficiency and goal of any organization, it is necessary that some basic principles should be adopted while designing the organization
 sanghathan ke siddhanth se taatpary, prashasnic sanghathanon kii un prakriyaaon tathaa niyamo se he, jiske anusaar prashasnic sanghathanon kaa sanchaalan hota he
 These principles include padosopan, unity of command, area of control, leadership, supervision, delegation, coordination, power and accountability etc
 'padanukram', angreji shabd hyrarki kaa hindikaran he
 'hirarki' means an arrangement of power or position from lowest to highest
 yah siddhanth sarvyaapee he
 Without Padasopan, no administrative organization can be imagined
 adhikansh sanghathan piramid aakaar ke hote hai
 The functions and responsibilities in the organization are divided between the unit and the sub-unit
 yah vibhaajan kshaitij tathaa lamb rup donon hi prakaar se kiya jaataa he
 As a result of long division, the levels of top management, middle level management, inspectors and specific functions are formed

 The decision process in the organization goes through these positions or levels
 jis samay sanghathan kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he, us samay vibhinn staron ke sambandh main sanghathan nirmaataaon ke mastishk main ucchata yaa nimnata kaa koi vichaar nahin hota he
 But the relationship between high and low or subordinates in organization behavior develops due to the difference in pay scales of different posts, the nature of responsibilities at different levels and the qualifications of personnel working at different administrative levels
 hyrarki kaa shabdic arth hota he nimnatar par ucchtar kaa shashan yaa niyantran
 In practice, the term refers to an organization that is organized in a successive sequence of steps, like a ladder or step, just as the ladder is placed one after the other, corresponding to one in the step ladder
 There is another post
 is padakram main prayek nichalaa pad yaa str apane se nikatatam ucch pad ke tathaa us pad ke madhyam se usase bhi upar ke pad tathaa usee prakaar sabase upar ke pad athwa padon ke aadhin hota he
 It is a valid principle of Padasopan that the higher officer cannot ignore the intermediary officer while making contact at the lower level
 thik usee prakaar koi bhi nimna padaadhikari ucch adhikari se sampark sthapit karte samay madhyasth adhikari kii avhelnaa nahin kar saktaa
 Leaping any pole while climbing or descending a ladder is not free from danger
 thik usee prakaar prashasan main kisi str ko langhna bhi sanghathan main prashasnic pareshaani utpann kar saktaa he
 All personnel in the organization are always expected to work through proper channels
 sanghathan main jab bhi koi patr vyavhaar yaa file chalati he, to upar kii ore yaa neeche kii ore jate samay prayek str par hote hue guzarati he
 This gradual process of Padasopan is also called 'proper medium'
 pad sopan ek aisi vyavastha he jisaki sahaayta se kisi sanghathan ke vibhinn vyaktiyon ke kaaryon ko ek duusare se joda jaataa he

 moonay tathaa raily kaa kahana he ki jahaan kahin bhi varisht or adhinsth ke sambandhon se bana logon kaa sanghathan hoga, vahiin seedhinuma siddhanth bhi lagu hoga
 According to Moon, this principle is found in all organizations

 According to Earl Latham, the stair step is such a planned system of high and low stanzas, which extends from top to bottom

 In this way, all the units are combined and made into one big unit to guide and control the activities of the organization in the step ladder
 je
 di milate ke anusaar pad sopan ek aisi paddati he jisamen vibhinn vyaktiyon ke prayaason ko aapas main jod diya jaataa he
 Moon and Rally have named the Padasopan system as the principle of the staircase process, and Hai Fayol has called it a cognitive chain
 unke anusaar jahaan kahin bhi ucch tathaa adhinsthon ke sambandhon se bana sanghathan hoga, vahiin par yah seedhinuma prakriya bhi avashya hogi
 In any organization, tasks and responsibilities are distributed in both vertical and vertical directions
 sanghathan main urdhvadhar vibhaajan main sheersh pad, madhyam pad tathaa nimna padon kii sthiti hoti he
 When new positions and levels are added to the formation, it increases vertically, whereas in the horizontal division, new new functions or positions are added without increasing the levels of foot steps

 'basamachi' shabd uzbek bhashaa se liya gaya he, jisamen iskaa arth 'daaku' hota he or yah hindi bhashaa main paae jane vaale 'badmaash' shabd kaa ek rup he
 The Russian occupation in the Turkistan region of Central Asia and the subsequent imperialist policies had greatly disturbed the traditional social and economic system, which was causing anger among the people there
 vidroh kii sabase pehali chingaariyaan tab bhadakin jab 1916 main roosi shahi sarkaar ne pratham vishwayuddh ke liye jabardastee turki muslim yuvakon ko fuj main bharti karne kii koshish kar rahi thi
 After the October Socialist Revolution of 1917, there was widespread violence in Fargana Valley which started spreading to other areas
 soviet sangh or roosiyon ke khilaaf hamale kai varshon tak bahut se ilaaqon main chale or in ugravadiyon ko 'basamachi' naam diya gaya
 For a long time the Basmacharis controlled many non-urban areas, although the pressure of the Soviet Red Army on them remained constant
 bahut se basamachi netaaon ne padosi afghanistan ko apana adda banaaya or afkhaan madadgaaron se sahaayta bhi lete rahe
 The Soviet Union also accused the British Raj, who was ruling India at the time, of helping the Basmatchis
 navambar 1921 main turki ke bhootpurv rakshaamantri, vonwar pasha, soviet sangh kii basmachiyon ke khilaaf sahaayta karne ke liye bukhaaraa pahunche
 They had sympathy for the Turkish castes, so instead of helping the Soviet Union, they joined the Basmachis and became their most important leader
 unka sapana tha ki purvi turkestan se lekar turki tak ek mahaan turki parisangh khadaa ho jaae
 He gave the slogan of Jihad and prepared the Basmachi army of 16,000 fighters
 is sab ke baad bhi basamachi kabhi bhi puri tarah sangathit nahin ho sake or bhinn jatiyon-qabeelon ke aadhaar par bante rahe
 The Soviet Union also kept the pressure on its communities on the one hand, Sovietization and Russianization on the one hand, but on the other hand, despite the atheistic policies of the government, it started to give some concessions and relaxations in the matter of religion
 unhone basamachi thikaanon kii hawaii bambaari bhi shuru kar di
 In June 1922, Soviet troops defeated the Bamachis in the Battle of Kaffroon
 khel khatm jaanakar vonwar pasha ne 4 agat 1922 ko soviet faujon par sidhaa akraman kiya, jisamen ve maare gaye
 Soviet military victories and a more tolerant environment for the inhabitants of Central Asia on a social scale have, over time, subsided the Basmachi rebellion

 Where chalanaa yaa chaalan yaa tahalnaa bhoomi par jaanwaron kaa gaman yaa sanchalan kaa mukhya prakaar he or yah daudane or rengne se alag hota he
 Walking is different in this sense from running, because only one foot of human or two legs is eliminated from the ground at every step while walking, while at every step, both feet of human or two legs end contact with the ground
 
 ashwon or inke jaise anya jeevon me daudane ke kai prakaar ho sakate he par chalate samay har kadam par inke teen pair bhoomi par hote hai
 In this phase of today's life, walking by foot has become almost impossible and the person, despite knowing all these benefits, shies away from walking or should we say that all of us have become idle due to the arrival of machine age Has come in the fire aakhirkaar aisa ho bhi kyon na, jabaki vaigyanikon ke nit naye-naye avishkaron kii suvidhaon ne hamen aalasy ke is dharaatal par laa bithaaya he jisaki vajah se paidal chalanaa gaiyr jaruri sa lagane laga he
 In fact, it underscores a huge drawback
 paidal chalanaa hamaari roj kii dincharya rupi jindagi main kaaphi had tak kam ho gaya he, kintu vartmaan samay main yah swasthya ke liye pehle se bhi zyada mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Walking is also equivalent to an exercise
 jahaan praat:kaal tahalne se sampoorn sharir par ek khaas asar padataa he vahiin sharir main ek khaas asar padataa he vahiin sharir main haathon, ghutanon evam janghaon jaise jodon ke dard se nijaat bhi dilaataa he
 Walking in the morning is good for health in every respect
 aashcharya kii baat to yah he ki paidal chalane se buudhe bhi jawan mahasoos karte hai kyonki aisa karne par unke uttakon kii marammat kaa kaary bhalee-bhaanti sampann ho jaataa he
 That is why if you keep in mind the desire to look young, then walk more and more
 yakeenan swasthya ke liye laabhakaari sabit hoga
 Walking not only makes the digestive system work properly, but it also benefits a person suffering from constipation
 or to or, tahalne se shaareerik swasthya uttam rahane ke saath-saath usase kahin adhik hamaare maansik swasthya ko phayda hota he
 It is important to note that this trend has been used for centuries to relieve fatigue and tension of the mind, because the structure of a person's feet is more suitable for walking than running
 daudane se zyada urja kharch hoti he jabaki pairon ke agle hisse masalan panjon par chalane vaale edi par chalane waalon kii tulana main 53 pratishat se 63 pratishat zyada urja kharch hoti he
 Not only this, the movement of the main muscles of the ankle, knee, hip and back increases to a large extent in comparison to walking on the heel while walking on the front of the feet
 isliye kehete hai ki daudane kii bajaay chalanaa hi behatar hota he
 The thing that should be kept in mind while walking is that it is important to remember the physical posture while walking otherwise it does not get the desired benefit
 tahaltey samay sharir ko bilkul sidhaa hona chahie tathaa munh band hona chahie or saans puri tarah naak ke maarg se hi lenaa chahie
 Only then will it prove profitable
 koshish karen ki fefdon ke bajaay pet se saans len
 This gives more oxygen to the body which goes to the brain and this increases the ability to think and understand
 haalanki paidal kabhi bhi chal sakate hai parantu visheshgyon ke anusaar tahalne ke liye praat:kaaleen or sandhya ke samay ko upyukt mana jaataa he kyonki us samay sharir se steroid hormone adhikadhik nikalate hai jo insaan ko sukhad anubhav mahasoos karaate hai
 So when we go out for a walk, we should give priority to habits like walking in the middle of trees and trees in the middle of the park instead of walking on the road and streets
 yah ek tathy he ki ghoomane se hamen maansik prasannataa kaa sanchaar dikhaai detaa he
 Walking can completely rejuvenate
 itnaa hi nahin, padhane vaale bacchon ke liye subah bhraman karnaa behad hi laabhadaayak he kyonki subah niyamit rup se tahalne se ekaagratha kaa sahaj hi vikaas hota he jisase yaad karne main adhik kathinaayee mahasoos nahin hoti
 According to experts, morning walk causes the endorphin hormone to be secreted in the brain due to which our mood changes and positive emotions arise
 isiilie aaj se hi paidal chalane kaa aham faisla kar lijie or taiyaar ho jaaie suryoday evam suryaast ke samay lambii jogging tak jane ke liye jo ki duniyaan kii sabase behtareen kasarat he
 Anyway, walking is life, so why not go for a lot of walking

 He gave the theory of human cultural and bio-social development which is called cultural-historical psychology
 unka mukhya kaaryakshetra vikaas manovigyaan tha
 He presented a theory related to the development of higher cognitive functions in children
 apane kariar ke aarmabhik kaal main unka tark tha ki tark-shakti kaa vikaas chihnon evam pratikon ke madhyam se hota he
 Vygotsky's social outlook presents a progressive analysis of cognitive development
 vastut: vaigotsaki ne balak ke sangyanatmak vikaas main samaaj evam uske saanskrithik sambandhon ke bich samvaad ko ek mahatvapurn aayam ghoshit kiya
 Like onions, Vygotsky also believed that children build knowledge
 kintu inke anusaar sangyanatmak vikaas ekaaki nahin ho saktaa, yah bhashaa-vikaas, saamaajik-vikaas, yahan tak ki shaareerik-vikaas ke saath-saath saamaajik-saanskrithik sandarbh main hota he
 According to Vygotsky, a developmental approach is needed to understand the cognitive development of the child that can test it from the beginning and recognize the changes in various forms properly
 is prakaar ek vishisht maansik kaary jaise- aatm-bhashaa ko vikasaatmak prakriyaaon ke rup main moolyankit kiya jaae, na ki ekaaki rup se
 According to Vygotsky, to understand cognitive development, testing of tools that mediate and give shape to cognitive development is essential
 isi ke aadhaar par ve yah bhi maanate hai ki bhashaa sangyanatmak vikaas kaa mahatvapurn aujaar he
 According to them, during early childhood, the child starts using language as a tool in planning and problem solving
 vaayagaski ne san 1924-34 main institute of psycholaji main adhyayan kiya
 Here he did special work on cognitive development, especially on the relation of language and thinking
 unke adhyayan main sangyaan ke vikaas ke aitihaasik, saanskrithik or saamaajik karkon ke prabhaav kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 According to Waigaski, language is the major symbolic tool given by the society which is particularly important in the development of the child
 jis prakaar ham jal ke anu kaa adhyayan uske bhaagon ke dwaara nahin kar sakate, usee prakaar vyakti kaa adhyayan bhi uske vaataavaran se pruthak hokar nahi kiya ja saktaa
 It is the study of a person in his social, cultural, historical and political context that gives us all his information
 vaayagaski ne sangyanatmak vikaas ke adhyayan ke dauraan pyaaje kaa adhyayan kiya or phir apana drushtikon viksit kiya
 According to Onge, development and learning are two distinct conceptions in which cognition affects language development as a natural process
 vikaas ho jane ke pashchaat us vishesh avasthaa main aavashyak kaushalon kii prapti hi adhigam he
 Thus according to the theory of onion, development is the precursor to learning and not the result
 arthath adhigam kaa str vikaas ke upar he
 According to the onus, it is necessary to first reach a certain development level for learning
 vaayagaski ke anusaar adhigam or vikaas kii parsparik prakriya main balak kii sakriy bhagidaari hoti he jisamen bhashaa kaa sangyaan par sidhaa prabhaav hota he
 Learning and development are interrelated processes that begin from the first day of a student's life
 vaayagaski ke anusaar vibhinn baalkon ke alag-alag vikaas str par adhigam kii vyavastha samroop to ho sakati he kintu ekarup nahin, kyonki sabhi bacchon kaa saamaajik anubhav alag hota he
 According to him, learning drives development
 unka yah drushtikon pyaaze ke siddhanth evam anya siddhanton se bhinn he
 Waigaski is known for its socio-cultural theory
 is siddhanth ke anusaar saamaajik antalakriya hi balak kii soch va vyavhaar main nirantar badlaav laata he jo ek samskruti se duusare main bhinn ho saktaa he
 According to him, the cognitive development of a child depends on the interrelationship with other people
 vaayagaski ne apane siddhanth main sangyaan or saamaajik vaataavaran kaa sammishran kiya
 Children come in contact with older and knowledgeable people than themselves and learn cultural ways of thinking and behavior
 saamaajik-saanskrithik siddhanth ke kai pramukh tatv he
 The first important element is personal language
 isamen balak apane vyavhaar ko niyantrit or nirdeshit karne ke liye swayan se baatcheet karte he
 The second important element of socio-cultural theory is the area of nearest development
 vaayagaski ne shikshak ke rup main anubhav ke dauraan yah janaa he ki balak apane vaastavik vikaas str se aage jaakar samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kar sakate he yadi unhen thodaa nirdesh mil jaae
 This level was called possible development by Vyagaski
 balak ke vaastavik vikaas str or sambhavit vikaas str ke bich ke antar / kshetra ko vaayagaski ne nikatatam vikaas kaa kshetra kaha

 isaki adhyakshata austrian rajaneta meternikh ne kii
 The main objective of the Congress was to resolve many issues and problems arising from the French Revolutionary War, the Napoleonic War and the disintegration of the Holy Roman Empire
 napolian ko waterlu kii paraajay ke pashchaat saint helena dweep nirvasit kar diya gaya, tatpashchaat austria kii rajdhani vienna main europe kii vijayi shaktiyaan 1815 main ekatrit hui
 The aim was to rearrange the map of Europe that Napoleon had reversed from his wars and victories
 vastutah austria ke chancelar meternikh ne nepolian ke viruddh morcha banane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi, isiilie uski pahal par austria kii rajdhani vienna main kangeras bulaai gai thi
 Many small countries of Europe participated in this conference, but in relation to policy making, the role of the representatives of the four main countries was important
 ye netaa the- austria kaa chancelar meternik, rus kaa jaar elexander, england kaa videsh mantri lord casalare tathaa francisi videsh mantri tailara
 After the defeat of Napoleon, the entire system of busy Europe and various opposing principles organized a conference in Vienna, the capital of Austria in 1815, in order to compromise it is known as the Vienna Congress
 nepolian ne apni vidhwans kaari yudhon se sampurna europe ko dhwast kar diya
 Therefore, this Congress was organized with the aim of crushing his power
 waterlu ke vijeta kranti virdohi the jo vinisht ho chukaa tha
 They were determined to restore it and secure the restoration arrangements

 Congress problem vienna kangras ke saamne anek prakaar kii samasyaayen thi
 The European map underwent considerable changes due to the First Napoleonic Wars
 vienna congress ke samaksh in rajyon kii purnsthapana kaa prashn tha duusari samasya krantikari bhaavana kaa daman- karnaa tha
 The question of the church was also a big problem
 vienna ke sadsy carch ke prabhaav ko phir se sthapit karnaa chaahate the
 The fourth problem was to eliminate the possibility of war so that no powerful person like Napoleon could be born again
 vijit rashtron ko puraskrit karnaa bhi ek anya samasya thi
 Principles and objectives of Vienna Congress- uparyukt samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye vienna congress ke kuch siddhant the jo is prakaar he
 Principle of balance of power iskaa pramukh siddhant shakti santulan tha arthath koi desh itnaa shaktishaalee na ban paae kii vah dusron ke liye khatarnaak ban jaae is liye france par pratibandh lagane ke liye holend sweetsraland, baberia tathaa serdinaya kaa vistaar kiya gaya
 France was surrounded by strong states from all sides
 isi tarah germany ko itnaa shaktishaalee banaaya gaya ki prasha sar nahin uthaa sake
 Austria was established in Italy, thus attempting to establish a balance of power
 taaki sampurna europe main shakti shanti bani rahe
 Principle of validity is siddhant ke aadhaar par 1789 ke europea maanchitr ko aadaar sweekaar kar vibhinn europea rajyon kii seemaa- nirdhaaran kaa praytn kiya gaya
 States like Holland, Purtigal, Naples, and Italy were returned to many old dynasties
 kshati- purti kaa siddhant- According to this theory, the countries which were destroyed by Napoleon and who fought against him
 unki kshati- purti karnaa or unhen puraskrit karnaa sweekaar kiya gaya
 The countries that supported Napoleon
 unhen dand diya gaya gaya tha
 Strengthening Frontier States against France - Its fourth principle should be to strengthen the frontier states against France so that France cannot dissolve international power
 uparyukt siddhanton ke atirikt iske anya siddhant bhi the
 Peace- To maintain the agreement, there must be power behind it
 at: england, austria, rus or prasha ne chatusutreey sandhi kii isi siddhant ke falswarup europea vyavastha kii utpatti hui
 Decision and territorial system of Vienna Congress- isane jo pradeshik vyavastha kii uske nimnlikhit uddeshy the
 Countries that took part in defeating Napoleon should be rewarded and those who were defeated should be punished
 europe main kranti se pehle kii vyavastha lagu kiya jaae
 So that European system can be built and peace and security can be maintained
 nepolayan ne jin rajyon ko france main shaamil kiya tha unhen chin liya gaya
 And the ancient dynasty was reestablished in France
 england ko aupniveshik or vyapaarik laabh hue
 The islands of Malta, Saint, Luciana, Mauritius were given from France to England
 prasha ko bhi laabh hua use uttari sexni, salahapel evam trile ke pradesh die gaye falat: uskaa rajya dugunna bad gaya or dakshini germany main uskaa prabhaav kaayam ho gaya
 Belgium was incorporated into Holland and the British dynasty was re-established there
 austria ko italy ke belaysia tata lombrardi ke pradesh die gaye
 Thus his influence in Central Europe was established and Metternak succeeded in his objective
 rus ko warsaw tathaa vesarevig mila
 As a result, it expanded considerably in Western Europe
 italy ko chote- chote rajyon main baantkar use vahaan ke pracheen shaskaon ko de diya gaya or italy main austria kaa prabhaav sthapit kiya gaya
 Poland ceased to exist
 rus, prasha or austria ne use aapas main baant liya
 The ancient dynasty was re-established in Spain
 yaddhapi purtegal ne angrejon kii sahaayta kii thi lekin ise kuch nahin diya gaya
 Sweden and Denmark received penalties
 steburland pehle se adhik shaktishaalee ho gaya
 It was made a powerful union of 22 states
 germany ke sambandh main congress ke nirnay kaaphi mahatvapurn the
 The remaining 38 states of Germany combined to form a federation
 jiskaa pradhan austria kaa samraat francisko pratham tha
 Apart from this, the Congress did many other things which made the practice of slavery immoral
 antarashtriya vidhiyon ke sambandh main bhi nirnay liye gaye
 To maintain European peace in the future, an international institution was established called the European system
 vienna congress ke kaaryon kaa mulyankan- The Vienna Congress began with the declaration of high ideals and objectives
 lekin uskaa uddeshy puraa nahin ho sakaa tha
 His manner of functioning was faulty
 sabhi raashtra apni swaarth siddhi main lage the
 Hence, it failed to solve the problems
 vienna sammelan kaa kaarykram swaarth parata par aadhaarit tha
 Its members expected moral principles
 is liye iske nirnay asthaayee anirthak sabit hue
 It did not make any effort in the new construction of Europe to fulfill the wishes of the people and to establish a permanent system
 isane sirf shaktisantulan ke siddhant ke aadhaar par rashtriya seemaa kaa nirdhaaran kiya kiya lekin lokapriy bhaavana ko koi mahatv nadeen diya
 The second allegation is that it left some tasks unfinished and did not address certain problems such as signing a treaty to protect European peace but it could not
 kuch itihaaskaaron ne vienna congress ko pratikrayavaadi kaha he
 There was no cost to the national sentiment for this, it is also alleged that the interests of small nations were neglected to protect the interests of big nations
 uparyukt aaropon ke baavjud yah sweekaar karnaa padegaa ki vienna main raajnneetik sanyam or doordarshta se kaam liya gaya tha
 It did an important work towards the unification of Germany and Italy
 itnaa hi nahin isamen das pratha vayapaarik swatantraaa aadi par bhi vichaar kiya gaya
 It did important work towards destroying the anarchy of the states
 isane antarashtriya samvidhan kaa bhi nirmaan kiya
 As a result of its actions, peace remained in Europe for 40 years
 pehali baar antarrashtriya vishyon par baat- chit karne ke liye baithak bulaai gai thi
 And it organized the European system, we can call it the first international organization
 yah bahut badi uplabdhi thi
 In order to achieve the above objectives and goals, Vienna Congress made some principles which were as follows: england ke aupniveshik samrajya main vruddhi kii gai
 He got the islands of Malta, Eligoland etc
 and the islands of Tobago, Mauritius and St
 Lucia in France and Trinidad regions from Spain
 france kii simaaen vahi nishchit kii gai jo kranti se purv kii thi
 After the Revolution period, all areas were taken away from France
 yuddh harjane ke rup main 70 karod fairunk kii raashi kii maang kii gai
 Powerful nations were created from the border areas of France so that in the future France could not disturb the peace of the continent
 france ke rajsinghaasana par punah burvo vansh ke lui 18wein ko baitha diya gaya
 The Holy Roman Empire existed before Napoleon in Germany
 nepolian ne use samaapt kar rin sangh kaa gathan kiya or vahaan rashtrawaad kaa prasar hua
 The Vienna Congress was determined to stop the spread of this nationality
 atah vahaan ek dhilaa-dhaala sangh banaaya gaya jiskaa adhyaksh austria kaa samraat francis bana
 Austria was given the territories of Venice and Lombardy in Italy
 poland se dakshin valasia bhi praapt hua
 Thus Austria regained lost power and prestige
 italy ko anek chote-chote rajyon main vibhakt kar diya gaya
 Italy became, in Maternick's words, only a geographical expression
 is prakaar italy par austria kaa prabhaav sthapit kiya gaya
 In Vienna Congress, slavery was opposed
 kangeras ne shanti banaae rakhane ke liye ek antarrashtriya sanstha kaa nirmaan kiya jise 'europea vyavastha' kaha ja jaataa he
 For the first time the International Constitution was created
 iske dwaara nadiyon main jahaajon kaa avaagaman, samudr kaa upyog tathaa rashtron ke bich parsparik vyavhaar ke muddon ko vyakhyayit kiya gaya
 The main achievement of the Vienna Congress was that it established peace in Europe for nearly 40 years, which Europeans needed most at that time
 vienna kangeras ne antarrashtriya str par shanti sthapit karne kii koshish kii tathaa europea vyavastha kii sthapana kar pratham antarrashtriya sanghathan kii sthapana kii jisaki aadharshila par aage chalakar rashtrasang va sanyukt rashtrasang kaa nirmaan hua
 France was treated fairly fairly in the Vienna Congress and was represented in the Congress despite being a defeated power, while defeated Germany was not represented in the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, and strict provisions of the treaty were imposed on it
 
 nishkarshtah kah sakate hai ki vienna kangeras ne tatkaalik rup se europe main shanti sthapit kii
 Take positive steps like dealing softly with France
 parantu udaarvaad, rashtrawaad jaisi vichaardhaara ke prasar ko rokane kaa prayaas kar itihaas kii dhara ke viruddh kaary kiya
 In this view, the Vienna Congress represented a reactionary mindset

 saralata ke liye unhen tarangarodh yaa panatod kehete hai
 The safety of the ports on the open seashore is achieved by the lakes
 samudri laharon main urja bahut badi maatra main hoti he ore tufaanon main baari se baari tathaa bade se bade pushte bhi visthapit ho jate hai, isaliye bandargahon kii suraksha ke liye panatodon ke nirmaan par bahut vyay kiya jaataa he
 Depending on the construction method and construction materials, the pits can be divided into three categories: 1
 tila rupi athwa dhalwaan panatod pattharon yaa kancreet ke blaakon se banate hai
 2
 Standing, vertically facing watercourses are made by filling stones in wooden crates, brick lime, stone lime and concrete etc
 3
 teesri shrenee main ve panatod aate hai jo donon shreniyon ke mail se banate hai
 The construction of these materials is based on the availability of construction materials, the depth of the water, the fluctuations of the ocean floor and the natural condition and available means etc
 is prakaar kaa panatod banane ke liye prakritik rup main paae gaye bade bade pathar tathaa kancreet ke block prayog main laae jate hai
 The spring is made equal to the maximum height of the tide and the height of the storm wave

 In the design of a pantode, keeping in mind its stability and durability, things have to be decided on the slope and at which place, which stone to measure
 nae panatodon par praarambhik tufaanon main kuch na kuch tut foot ho janaa saadhaaran si baat he or sheeghra se sheeghra marammat ho janaa aavashyak he
 In this way, slowly, these watercrafts become more permanent and the cost of repair also decreases
 dhalwaan panatod ke teen yaa teen se adhik bhaag hote hai : halakaa, bich kii shrenee kaa tathaa baari
 Light section is placed at the bottom and center
 isamen khadaanon se khaarij hua malwa bharaa jaataa he
 The middle section is for securing the slopes of the lighter section and stones ranging from a few kilograms to 4-5 tons are put in it
 baari bhaag sabase upar hota he ore isamen 1 ton se 10 ton tak bhaar ke pathar daale jate hai
 These types of watercourses are designed with the consideration of the pressure produced by the sea waves
 dhalwaan panatod ke sthaan par khadey panatod bana dene ke kaaran atyadhik kshati hoti hui dekhi gai he
 By studying the failures and principles of the thorns, the following precautions can be prescribed for the use of standing thorns: 1
 is prakaar ke panatod kaa kaary tufaan kii laharon ko palatnaa he, taaki vah diwaar ke duusari ore na ja sake
 2
 If there is an angle of more than 45 degrees in the alignment of the wave and the direction of the wave, the wave is reversed
 yadi kone 45 degree se kam ho to vah panatod ko kshati pahunchaa sakati he
 3
 Slope can be made on all types of seaside, but standing crest can be made only on a solid foundation, which is not expected to be deep
 4
 panatod ke liye neenv thik karne, mulaayam chattan kii khudaai karne aadi main gotakhoron kii aavashyaktaa padati he or is kaaran yadi pani kii gaharaai adhik ho to panatod aarthik drushti se amaanya ho jate hai
 On the contrary, standing watertight also has some benefits
 nirmaan saamagree kii kam maatra main aavashyaktaa padati he
 Standing watercourses are cheaper even if the price of stones on the beach is high
 is shrenee ke panatodon kii dekharekh or marammat kaa vyay bhi kam hota he
 Mixed design pits are made where the natural condition is such that the mixed design saves the expenditure as well as the construction facility

 The subject of thunderstorms is somewhat complicated, because the condition and behavior of the sea is very variable

 Justice Prem Shankar Gupta is a law graduate from Allahabad University
 nyaayadhish niyukt hone se purv unhone bharat ke rajya or centre sarkaron main adhivaktaa ke rup main kaam kiya
 In 1977, he was appointed as a permanent judge of the Allahabad High Court
 unhone tabhi se nyaayadhish ke rup main rajbhasha hindi main apane nirnay dena prarambh kiya tha or apane lagbhag 15 varsh ke kaarykaal main unhone lagbhag 4000 nirnay hindi bhashaa main die
 He was honored on many occasions for his commendable work

 The Government of Uttar Pradesh appointed you District Government Advocate Etawah in the year 1964
 jis pad par aap varsh 1971 tak kushalta se kaary karte rahe
 In the early nineteen seventies, after leaving full advocacy in Etawah in the Gupta district and came to advocate in Allahabad, the High Court at that time had dominion of English and one could not imagine that the High Court could also argue in Hindi It may be, but Mr
 Gupta testified that talent is not a special language and the expression made in our own language Arguments made in English may be more effective

 There are many common problems related to logarithms in mathematics
 Logarithms can be used to make calculations easier
 For example, two numbers can be multiplied just by using a logarithm table and adding
 Where b { \ displaystyle b}, x { \ displaystyle x}, and y { \ displaystyle y} are positive real numbers and b ≠ 1 { \ displaystyle b \ neq 1}
 Both c { \ displaystyle c} and d { \ displaystyle d} are real numbers
 Note that log b ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ log _{b} \ ! \ ,} is undefined because there is no number x { \ displaystyle x \ ! \ ,} such that b x = 0 { \ displaystyle b^{x}=0 \ ! \ ,} 
 In fact, there is a vertical asymptote on the graph of log b ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ log _{b} \ ! \ ,} at x = 0 { \ displaystyle x=0} 
 Logarithms and exponentials with the same base cancel each other
 This is true because logarithms and exponentials are inverse operations
 This identity is needed to evaluate logarithms on calculators
 For instance, most calculators have buttons for ln and for log10, but not for log2
 To find log2, one must calculate log10 / log10 / ln, which yields the same result)
 This formula has several consequences: where π { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi \ ,} is any permutation of the subscripts 1, 


, n
 For example The following summation / subtraction rule is especially useful in probability theory when one is dealing with a sum of log-probabilities: which gives the special cases: Note that in practice a { \ displaystyle a} and c { \ displaystyle c} have to be switched on the right hand side of the equations if c> a { \ displaystyle c> a}
 Also note that the subtraction identity is not defined if a = c { \ displaystyle a = c} since the logarithm of zero is not defined
 More generally: where a 0,


, a N> 0 { \ displaystyle a_ {0}, \ ldots, a_ {N}> 0}
 a useful identity involving exponents: The last limit is often summarized as "logarithms grow more slowly than any power or root of x"
 Where x > 0 { \ displaystyle x>0}, b > 0 { \ displaystyle b>0}, and b ≠ 1 { \ displaystyle b eq 1} 
 To remember higher integrals, it's convenient to define: Then, The identities of logarithms can be used to approximate large numbers
 Note that logb + logb = logb, where a, b, and c are arbitrary constants
 Suppose that one wants to approximate the 44th Mersenne prime, 232,582,657 - 1
 To get the base-10 logarithm, we would multiply 32,582,657 by log10, getting 9,808,357
09543 = 9,808,357 + 0
09543
 We can then get 109,808,357 × 100
09543 ≈ 1
25 × 109,808,357
 Similarly, factorials can be approximated by summing the logarithms of the terms
 The complex logarithm is the complex number analogue of the logarithm function
 No single valued function on the complex plane can satisfy the normal rules for logarithms
 However a multivalued function can be defined which satisfies most of the identities
 It is always to consider this as a function defined on a Riemann surface
 a single valued version called the principal value of the logarithm can be defined which is discontinuous on the negative x axis and equals the multivalued version on a single branch cut
 The convention will be used here that a capital first letter is used for the principal value of functions and the lower case version refers to the multivalued function
 The single valued version of definitions and identities is always given first followed by a separate section for the multiple valued versions
 The multiple valued version of log is a set but it is easier to write it without braces and using it in formulas as follows clear rules
 When k is any integer: Principal value forms: Multiple value forms, for any k an integer: Principal value forms: Multiple value forms: a complex power of a complex number can have many possible values
 Principal value form: Multiple value forms: Where k1, k2 are any integers: tt thirumala express 7487 bhartiya rail dwaara sanchalit ek mail express train he
