 Everyone wished, but no one got up for fear of self-immolation
 tab yajyavalkyaji ne apane ek shishy se kaha- betaa! in gauon ko apane yahan haak le chalo
 On hearing this, all the sages started discussing with Yajnavalkyaji
 bhagwaan yajyavalkyaji ne sabake prashnon kaa yathavidhi uttar diya
 Brahmavadini Gargi was also called in that meeting
 sabake pashchaat yajyavalkyaji se shastrarth karne ve uthi

 mahadevi verma rahasyavaad or chhayavaad kii kavyitri thim, atah unke kavy main aatma-paramatma ke milan virah tathaa prakruti ke vyapaaron kii chaaya spasht rup se drushtigochar hoti he
 Pain and suffering were the soul of Mahadevi's poetry
 unka samast kavy vednamay he
 He has been called a poetess of pessimism or pessimism
 ve swayan likhti hai, dukh mere nikat jivan kaa aisa kavy he, jisamen saare sansar ko ek sutara main band rakhane kii kshamta he
 In his poems, there is a cry of boundless consciousness lying in the bound of the border
 yah vednaa loukik vednaa se bhinn aadhyatmik jagat kii he, jo usee ke liye sahaj sanvedya ho sakati he, jisane us anubhuti kshetra main pravesh kiya ho
 By the way, Mahadevi also refers to this anguish as "the one who has the ability to bind the whole world in one sutra" (but the sorrow that binds the world in one sutra is usually temporal sorrow, which is the tradition of Indian literature There is a permanent feeling of Karun Rasa
 mahadevi ne is dukh ko nahin apanaaya he
 She says, "I love both forms of grief
 ek vah, jo manushya ke samvedansheel hryday ko saare sansar se ek avichhinn bandhanon main band detaa he or doosraa vah, jo kaal or seemaa ke bandhan main pade hue aseem chetana kaa krandan he" kintu, unke kavy main pehle prakaar kaa nahin, duusare prakaar kaa 'krandan' hi abhivyakt hua he
 This anguish is not an object of ordinary public heart
 sambhawatah isiilie ramchandra shukla ne uski sachai main hi andeh vyakt karte hue likhaa he, "is vednaa ko lekar unhone hryday kii aisi anubhutiyaan saamne rakhin, jo lokottar hai
 To what extent they are real sensations and to what extent they are pleasurable, cannot be said ”
 isi aadhyatmik vednaa kii disha main prarambh se ant tak mahadevi ke kavy kii sookshm or vivrutt bhavanubhootiyon kaa vikaas or prasar dikhaai padataa he
 Dr
 Hazari Prasad Dwivedi considers the pain of his poetry more than the poetry of Meera
 samast maanav jivan ko ve niraashaa or vyathaa se paripurna rup main dekhati thim
 She describes herself as Neer Bhali Badli - i changed Neer filled with grief
 vistrut nabh kaa koi konaa, meraa na kabhi apana hona
 Introduction: This history was the same - it was erased yesterday and it went on today
 mahadevi ji ke prem varnan main ishwariya virah kii pradhanta he
 He has decorated beautiful pictures of the soul's everlasting perplexity and the eagerness to meet Brahm - i love someone's love of all the tears that are pouring in every particle
 main palkon main paal rahi hoon, yah sapana sukumaar kisi kaa
 Many compositions have been written in 'agni Rekha', considering the lamp as a symbol
 saath hi anek vishyon par bhi kavitaayen hai
 Mahadevi Varma thinks that the lamp battles not the sun - raat ke is saghan andhere main jujhataa surya nahin, jujhataa rahaa deepak! koun si rashmi kab hui compit, koun aandhi vahaan pahunch paayi? koun tehra sakaa use pal bhar, koun si phunk kab buja paayi
 
 agnirekha ke purv bhi mahadevi ji ne deepak ko pratik maanakar anek geet likhe hai- kin upkarnon kaa deepak, madhur-madhur mere deepak jal, sab buje deepak jala don, yah mandir kaa deep ise neerav jalane do, pujari deep kahan sota he, deepak ab jaati re, deep mere jal akmpit ghul achanchal, poochta kyon shesh kitni raat aadi
 Mahadevi has a unique and unique place among the poets of Chhayavad, unlike others
 is vishistataa ke do kaaran hai - ek to unka komal hrydaya nari hona or doosraa angrezi or bangala ke romantic or rahasywaadee kavy se prabhavit hona
 For both of these reasons, on the one hand, he was allowed to naturally consider his spiritual favorite as a man, to invest in his feminine senses, on the other hand, on the other hand, the study of ancient Indian literature and philosophy and the mystic poetry of the saint era and its predecessor and contemporary cinematographers Poets have a close acquaintance with poetry as a result of their poetry and intellectual consciousness The religion remained in line with Indian tradition
 is tarah unke kavy main jahaan krishna bhakthi kavy kii virah-bhaavana gopiyon ke madhyam se nahin, sidhe apni aadhyatmik anubhuti kii abhivyakti ke rup main prakashit hui hai, vahiin sufi purush kaviyon kii bhanti unhen paramatma ko nari ke pratik main pratishthit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin padi
 Nature depiction - Like other mystic and cinematic poets, Mahadevi has also presented beautiful pictures of nature in his poetry
 unhen prakruti main apane priy kaa abhas miltaa he or usase unke bhaavon ko chetana praapt hoti he
 She does her makeup with the tools of nature to woo her beloved - looking in Shashi's mirror, i solved the black hairstyle
 goonthe chun tarak parijaat, avagunthan kar kirane ashesh
 Shadowism and nature have an interdependent relationship
 mahadevi ji ke anusaar- 'chhayavaad kii prakruti, ghat-coop aadi se bhare jal kii ekarupata ke samaan anek roopon se prakat ek mahapraan ban gayi
 Being a painter himself, he has made many gorgeous and attractive pictures of nature
 mahadevi ji kii kavita ke do kone hai- ek to unhone chetanamayi prakruti kaa swatantra vishleshan kiya he-''kanak se din moti si raat, sunahali sanjh gulabi praat mitaatha rangata barambar koun jag kaa vah chitradhaar?' Or 'shashi's new Rashmi ring on the sweet new bean bandhan Shish flower' Sit Avagunthan slowly descending from the horizon
 ' Secondly, considering nature as part of the world, he has mainly depicted mystery practice
 kavyitri ko anant ke darshan ke liye kshitij ke duusare chor ko dekhne kii jigyaasa he-'tod do yah kshitij main bhi dekh lun us ore kya he?ja rahe jis path se yugalkalp chor kya he?' He has expressed all emotions and feelings through nature
 'sandhyagit' main ve apane jivan kii tulana sandhya-gagan se karti hai-'priy sandhya gagan meraa jivan yah kshitij bana dhundla viraganav arun arun meraa suhaag chaaya-si kaaya vitrag' Mahadevi's creation process has been purely emotional
 unki dharanaon ko yug ke vibhinn vaad parivartit nahin kar sake hai
 He did not center any one philosophy
 jise jivan athwa samaaj ke liye upyukt samajha use aatmsaat kar liya
 Mahadevi ji is purely a nurturer of Indian culture and its influence is reflected in all her poetic works
 ve chhayavaad kaa mul darshan sarvatmavaad ko maanati he or prakruti ko uskaa saadhan maanati hai- 'chhayavaad ne manushya hryday or prakruti ke us sambandh main praan daal die jo prachinkaal se bimb pratibimb ke rup main chalaa aa rahaa tha, jiske kaaran manushya ko prakruti apane dukh main udhaas or sukh main pulakit jaan padati thi
 He has especially described the emotional connection with nature while discussing cinematism
 iske saath hi unhone sookshm yaa antar kii saundarya vritti ke udghaatan par bal diya he
 The poetry of Mahadevi is full of realization, the poems of Pant and Nirala are subdued by the burden of philosophicalism, but there is no such thing in the poetry of Mahadevi Ji
 usamen darshaniktaa hote hue bhi sarasata he
 He is spiritually dominant everywhere
 mahadevi ji ke kavy main sangitatmakataa kaa vishesh gun he
 She is a song writer
 geeton kii lay chhandon par unka adbhut adhikaar har jagah dikhaai detaa he
 She is a worshiper of Mahadevi Madhurya Bhava
 brahm ko unhone priyatam ke rup main dekha he
 He has given a 'dear' address to his beloved
 unke geet ujjwal prem ke geet hai
 The sattvikta of which he has introduced his difference is the pillar of his poetic dignity
 jab jivan main divya prem ke madhu sangeet ke raagini zankrut hui tab kavyitri ke man main usne asankhya nae swapnon ko janm diya-'in lalachaai aankhon par paharaa tha jab vrida kasamrajya mujhe de daalaa us chitwan ne pidaa kaa
 ' chir trishit aatma yug-yug se sarvavishwavyaapee paramatma se milan ke liye vyakul rahi he
 Vedananubhuti of Mahadevi ji is an easy expression of the conceptual feeling
 'milan kaa mat naam lo, main virah main chir hoon' kahkar ve isi virah ko jivan kii sadhana maanati he
 Not only did he declare the importance of suffering, he has also explained its happy side
 unke sukh kaa koi swatantra astitv nahin hai
 When grief reaches its final limit, then that sorrow takes the form of happiness
 'chir dhyey yahi jalane kaa thandi vibhuti ho janaahai pidaa kii seemaa yah dukh kaa chir sukh ho janaa' Mahadevi ji has been within mysticism among the poets called Chhayawadi
 us agyaat priyatam ke liye vednaa hi unke hriday kaa bhavakendra he jisase anek prakaar kii bhavanaayen, chhot chhootakar jhalak maarthi rahati hai
 She has expressed her natural love with pain, she wants to be with him
 uske aage milansukh ko bhi ve kuch nahin ginatin
 She says - take the name of the union, i am forever in Virah
 is vednaa ko lekar inhone hriday kii aisi anubhutiyaan saamne rakhi hai jo lokottar hai
 To what extent they are real sensations and to what extent they are delightful imaginations, it cannot be said
 ek paksh me anant sushamaa, duusare paksh main apaar vednaa, vishwa ke chor hai jinke bich uski abhivyakti hoti he— yah donon do oren thim sansruti kii chitrapati kii us bin meraa dukh suunaa mujh bin vah sushamaa feeki
 There is so much of pain in it - you will find you in pain and you will find pain
 ve dukh ko jivan kii sphurti tathaa prerana tatv maanati hai
 In her view, the importance of pain is due to three reasons - it purifies the conscience
 priy ko adhik nikat laati he or priyatam kii shobhaa bhi usee par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, three forms of grief are found in his poetry, constructive, compassionate and sadistic
 ve baudhon ke nairashyavaad ko sweekaar nahin karatin
 She has accepted grief as a sweet gesture in which she wants to burn as a lamp for the supernatural beloved - 'madhur-madhur my lamp Jalyuga-yuga, every day by revealing the path of every moment, beloved
 ' According to him, grief is such a poem of life which has the ability to bind the whole world in one thread
 unka dukh yashtiparak na hokar samashtiprak rahaa he
 He has said that personal happiness gives meaning to life by dissolving in world world and personal sorrow dissolves in world happiness and gives life immortality
 unka sandesh he-'mere hanste adhar nahin, jag kii ansu ladiyaan dekho,mere geele palak chhuo mat murjhaai kaliyaan dekho
 ' chhayavaadi kavy main ek aadhyatmik aavaran tathaa chaaya rahi he
 Hence mysticism was used for a particular tendency of cinematic poetry
 mahadevi ji ke anusaar 'rahasy kaa arth vahaan se hota he jahaan dharm kii iti he
 The worshiper of the mystery realizes harmonious divineness in the heart, and she senses his behavior with her pacific sensation like a lamp, keeping it within the curtain
 ' mahadevi ji kii ruchi sansaarik bhoga kii apeksha aadhyatmikta kii ore adhik darshit hoti hai
 The five stages of mysticism are targeted in his poetry
 jigyaasa, aasthaa, advaitabhaavna, pranyanubhuti virahanubhuti
 In Mahadevi ji there has been a constant curiosity to know, to see that supreme being
 vah kautuhal se puuchhati hai- 'koun tum mere hryday menkun meri kasak main nit madhurata bharta alakshith?' His faith in his unknown beloved is not merely intellectual but is emotional - 'madhuk Pranay with sad distress came from the dream of the dream, to hear silently then Madhumal Murali's voice
 ' His innovative imagination symbolizes 'bean and ragini' for the monotheism of the soul and the divine is a beautiful example
 unki yah bhaavana kore darshanik gyaan yaa tatv chintan par aadhaarit nahin he apitu usamen hryday kaa bhavatmak yoga bhi lakshith hota he- 'I am with you, each one is like Rashmi Prakash, i am from you, as different as the lightness of a cube
 ' Some early poems of Mahadevi ji are in Brajbhasha, but later entire compositions have been done in Khadi Boli
 mahadevi ji kii khadi boli sanskrit-mishrit he
 They are sweet, soft and full of flow
 usamen kahin bhi neerasata or karkashta nahin
 Although the language of Mahadevi ji is simple, but due to being indicative in the portrayal of subtle feelings, she has become obscure at some places
 shabd chayan atyant sundar he, kintu bhashaa main komalta or madhurata laane ke liye kahin-kahin shabdon kaa ang-bhang avashya miltaa he
 Such as base base, desires desires etc
 mahadevi ji kii style main nirantar vikaas hota rahaa he
 His style in 'nihar' is in its infancy

 There is a similarity of sentiment and language in the style of 'neerja'
 'deepashikha' kii rachana main unki style praudh ho gai he or thode shabdon main bahut kuch kehane kii kshamta aa gai he
 Mahadevi ji was very skilled in making expressions
 unhone apni kavitaaon main pratikon or sanketon kaa aashray adhik liya he
 Hence, his style has become somewhat complicated and arduous at times and the reader has to work hard to understand the meaning of the poem
 mahadevi kii kavita viyog-shringaar pradhan he
 Mystical images of disconnection as they are written are extremely rare

 They include music and rhythm in particular

 His poetry is a successful form of craft legislation of cinematic poetry
 geetikavy ke tatv anubhuti pravanta, atmabhivyakti, sankshiptata, bhavanvit, geyata aadi unke kavy main purnatah darshit hote hai
 He himself has said, 'it is a song to describe the emotional state of happiness and sorrow in very few words
 ' abhivyakti kii kalaatmakataa, lakshanikta, sthool ke sthaan par sookshm upmaanon kaa grahan, komalkant padaavalee, kalpana kaa vaibhav, chitratmakataa, pratik vidhaan, bimb yojana aadi kalathatvon kaa unki kavita main purna abhinivesh he
 His craft talent is unique
 unke antas kaa kalakaar kala ke prati sarvada sachesht rahaa he
 For example, 'rakesh washes away Nisha in the moonlight when Alaken says to Kholakali,' Tell me Madhumas and buy the honey
 'bimbaatmakataa-'moti-si raat kanak se dingulaabi praat sunahali saanj
 ' 'deep' mahadevi ke kavy kaa mahatvapurn pratik he
 Apart from this, Bein and Ragini, Darpan and Chhaya, Dhan and Damini, Rashmi and Prakash have come again and again in his poetry
 dow nagendra ke shabdon main "mahadevi ke kavy main hamen chhayavaad kaa abhimishrit rup miltaa he
 The art stolen from the butterfly's wings, the petals of the flowers, and above all a pneumatic atmosphere woven like a dream - all these elements in which are mixed together is the poem of Mahadevi

 Blood pressure is the pressure exerted on the vessel walls by the blood flowing into the blood vessels
 dhamniyaan vah nalika he jo pump karne vaale hriday se rakt ko sharir ke sabhi utakon or indriyon tak le jate hai
 The heart regulates blood flow in the arteries by pumping blood into the arteries and the pressure applied on it is called blood pressure
 kisi vyakti kaa raktchaap, systolic / dyastolic raktchaap ke rup main abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 For example 120 / 80 systolic means the number above represents the pressure in the arteries
 isamen hriday kii mansapeshiyaan sankuchit hokar dhamniyon main rakt ko pump karti hai
 Dyelastic blood pressure, ie the lower number, represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle relaxes after contraction
 raktchaap hameshaa us samay adhik hota he jab hriday pump kar rahaa hota he banisbat jab vah shithil hota he
 The systolic blood pressure of a healthy adult person is between 90 and 120 millimeters of mercury

 ke bich hota he
 Normal blood pressure should be 120 / 80 as per current guidelines
 raktchaap ko maapne vaale yantra ko raktchapamapi yaa sphignomanometer kehete hai
 Some important stages in the history of development of blood pressure detection and measurement are as follows: nimna raktchaap vah daab he jisase dhamniyon or nason main rakt kaa pravaah kam hone ke lakshan yaa sanket dikhaai dete hai
 When the blood flow is very low, oxygen and nutritious substances cannot reach the vital senses like brain, heart and kidneys, due to which these senses do not work normally and this can cause it to be permanently damaged
 ucch raktchaap ke vipareet, nimna raktchaap kii pahchaan multah lakshan or sanket se hoti he, na ki vishisht daab sankhya ke
 Some people have a blood pressure of 90 / 50 but they do not show any symptoms of low blood pressure and hence they do not have low blood pressure, however in those people whose blood pressure is high and their blood pressure falls to 100 / 60 Symptoms of low blood pressure begin to appear
 yadi kisi ko nimna raktchaap ke kaaran chakkar aata ho yaa mitli aati ho yaa khadey hone par behosh hokar gir padataa ho to use orthostetic ucch raktchaap kehete hai
 The normal person is able to control the effect caused by low pressure on standing
 lekin jab paryaapt raktchaap ke kaaran chakree dhamni main rakt kii aapurti nahin hoti he to vyakti ko seene main dard ho saktaa he yaa dil kaa daura pad saktaa he
 When there is insufficient blood supply in the kidneys, the kidneys cannot remove wastes like urea and creatine from the body, due to which their quantity in the blood is increased
 coronary arteri yani vah dhamni jo hriday ke maance peshiyon ko rakt kii aapurti karti he
 This is a condition that can be life threatening
 nimna raktchaap kii sthiti main gurde, hriday, fefde tathaa mastishk teji se kharaab hone lagate hai
 Blood pressure above 130 / 80 is called hypertension or hypertension
 iskaa arth he ki dhamniyon main ucch chaap he
 High blood pressure does not mean excessive emotional stress
 bhaavnaatmak tanaav va dabaav asthaayee taur par rakt ke daab ko badha dete hai
 Blood pressure should generally be lower than 120 / 80 and blood pressure between 120 / 80 and 139 / 89 is called pre hypertension and a blood pressure of 140 / 90 or more is considered high

 If you feel dizzy, have headaches, trouble breathing, lack of sleep, remain pensive, breathe less hard and have nose bleed, then check with a doctor, it may be due to high blood pressure
 ucch raktatchaap ke kaarnon main: Diagnosis of high blood pressure is important so that normalization of blood pressure is possible to prevent complications

 According to Canadian researcher Ross D
 Feldman, high blood pressure patients need special care and examination, which can reduce the risk of heart attack by one-fourth, while also reducing the chance of stroke by 40 percent
 je en si, saat-2003 ke anusaar raktchaap kaa nimna vargeekaran, 18 varsh se adhik vayaskon hetu bataaya jaataa he
 This is an average based on correctly taken blood pressure readings of people sitting in the office
 chikitsak ke paas jaanch hetu pahunchane ke baad kam-se-kam paanch minute ke liye aaraam karne ke baad hi apana raktadab dikhaaen
 After walking for a long time, the blood pressure is increased after climbing the stairs, checking immediately after running and running

 The width of the cuff to be tied on the arm of the blood pressure gauge should be according to the thickness of the arm
 kaph itnaa chaudaa ho ki baanh kaa lagbhag teen-chauthai gheraa usamen aa jaae
 If the arm is thick, blood pressure readings will be increased when blood pressure is taken from normal phlegm
 yadi baanh patali or kaph bada he to thik ulat hoga, raktadab kam napega
 Always use a test instrument to measure blood pressure
 kai baar raktchaap do jagah napa jaaen to antar miltaa he, yahaan tak ki nurse dwaara napa gaya to kam aata he or doctor dwaara napa gaya adhik
 Many times when blood pressure is measured in the office, it comes more and less at home, it is called white coat hypertension
 is tarah ke bade raktchaap kaa upachaar karne kii atyaavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 If the width of the cuff in the arm of the blood pressure measuring instrument is small, it is inflated slowly or very rapidly, then the blood pressure will be higher
 baanh main baandhi gayi pattee ko haday ke str par na rakhaa jaae to raktchaap galat aayegaa
 There may be many other reasons like this, if special care is not taken, blood pressure will come wrong
 marakari ke jo maapak-yantra hai ve electranik yantron se zyada sahi reeding dete hai
 Due to all these factors, it is necessary that once the blood pressure rises, the medicine should not be started immediately
 kam se kam teen baar kuch dinon ke antaraal par raktchaap napa jaae
 Treatment should be started only if the average of several readings has increased
 yadi rogi baari chintaa main hon to thodi der ke liye raktchaap bad jayega
 Blood pressure will be increased even after adequate exercise
 yah ek saamaanya prakriya he or iskaa upachaar nahin kiya jaataa
 Where there is a dilemma, the new technology ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is done to assess the exact situation

 It is considered to be the best among Jain pilgrimages

 Therefore it is called 'siddhakshetra' and in Jainism it is called Tirtharaj i

 'king of Tirthas'
 yah tirth bharat ke jharkhand pradesh ke giridih jile main madhuban kshetra main sthit he
 It is the main pilgrimage of Jainism
 ise 'parasnath parvat' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to Jain texts, the existence of both Samamed Shikhar and Ayodhya is parallel to creation
 isliye inako 'shaashvat' mana jaataa he 
 Here in ancient texts, Tirthankaras and ascetic saints attained salvation through rigorous penance and meditation
 yahi kaaran he ki jab sammed shikhar tirthayatra shuru hoti he to har tirthayatri kaa man tirthankarasn kaa samaran kar apaar shraddha, aasthaa, utsaah or khushi se bharaa hota he
 It is written in Jainism scriptures that once a soulful pilgrimage to the Samkad Shikhar shrine in one's life, a person does not get animal vagina and hell after death
 yah bhi likhaa gaya he ki jo vyakti sammed shikhar aakar puure man, bhav or nishtha se bhakthi karata he, use moksh praapt hota he or is sansar ke sabhi janm-karm ke bandhanon se agle 49 janmon tak mukt vah rahata he

 The natural violent behavior of wild animals like lions, tigers, etc
 found here is not seen due to the sanctity and sattvikta of this region
 is kaaran tirthayatri bhi bina bhay ke yatra karte hai
 It is probably because of this effect that many kings, Acharyas, Bhattaraks, Shravaks from ancient times came here with huge groups for pilgrimage in the spirit of self-welfare and salvation, worshiping Tirthankaras, meditating and performing rigorous penance

 shrimadbhagwat devibhagwat ke swarupanirdesh ke vishay main maun he
 But Devi Bhagwat counts 'bhagavata' under the subpuras and itself under the Puranas

 ] Counter digital tark or computing ke sandarbh me counter ek upkaran he jo ek vishesh ghatana yaa prakriya kii sankhya ko store athwa pradarshit karata he
 The counter is often connected to a clock signal
 electronix main countaron kaa upyog aise flip flop ke rup main register prakaar circuit ke madhyam se kaaphi aasaani se lagu kiya ja saktaa he, or vargeekaran kii ek vistrut vividhta maujuud hai: Each counter is useful for various applications
 aamtaur par, counter circuit rup main digital rahe hai, or swaabhaavik binary main ginate hai
 Many types of counter circuits are available as digital blocks, for example, chips in the 4000 series that implement different counters
 kabhi kabhi swaabhaavik dwiadhari anukram ke alaava kisi anya ginati anukram kaa upyog karnaa laabhadaayak hota he jaise dwiadhari kodit dashamalav counter, ek raikhik pratikriya badlaav register counter, yaa ek grey code counter
 Counters are useful for digital clocks and timers, and oven timers, VCR clocks, etc
 atulykaalik counterek atulykaalik counter apni hi ulte utpaadan main pratikriya ke conection se je input ke saath, ek hi prakaar kaa di flip flop he
 This circuit can hold one bit, that is, count from zero to one
 yah circuit har ek ghadi chakra main ek vruddhi karata he or do ghadi chakra main circuit se baahar nikal jaataa he, at: yah 0-1 ke ek sankraman or 1-0 ke ek sankraman ke bich vaikalpik hogi
 Note that this creates a new clock with a 50% duty cycle at exactly half the frequency of the input clock
 agar yah anupaad ek isi tarah kii vyavasthit di flip flop ke ghadi ke liye istamaal kiya jaye, to aadhe ke rup main teji se ginne vaala aisa ek or counter mil jayega
 By connecting the two, we will get a two-bit counter
 hm utpaadan ko palat kar imput, or pichley utpaadan ko ghadi kii tarah istamaal kar, adhiktar flip-flope jod sakate hai
 From this we get a wave counter that counts 2n-1 times, where n is the number of bits of the counter
 tarang counter main asthir utpaadan dekha jaataa he, jahaan aplav stage se stage se umad aata he
 This is the application of dividing the clock signal where the overall division division is necessary and instantaneous counting is unnecessary
 tulykaalik counter All the flip-flop watches in synchronous counters are added together and triggered by input
 tathaa sari flip-flope saath main avasthaa badalte hai
 The 4-bit circuit of the synchronous counter is given below
 FF0 ke j or k imput HIGH se jode jate hai
 The j and k inputs of FF1 are connected to the output of FF0
 FF2 ke j or k imput ek AND get ke utpaadan se jode jate hai, jise FF0 or FF1 kaa utpaadan praapt hota he
 The simplest way to apply the logic of every single bit of an ascending counter is to toggle each bit when all the less significant bits are in the HIGH state
 udhaaharan ke liye jab bit 0 hota he bit 1 togal karata he, jab bit 0 or 1 hote hai tab bit 2 togal karata he, ityadi
 Decade counter dashak counter binary main ginaney ke bajaae dashamalav ank main ginata he
 The decade counter can count in binary coded decimals, such as IC 7490, or in binary encoding
 dashak counter binary counter he jo 1010b tak ginaney ke liye dizine kiya gaya he
 By placing a NAND gate in a simple 4 stage counter, we can convert it into a decade counter
 dekhiye ki FF2 or FF4 NAND get ke imput hai
 The output of the NAND gate is connected to the CLR input of each flip-flop
 dashak counter 0 se 1 tak ginakar phir se 0 main riset ho jaataa he
 Counter output can be zeroed by giving the reset in LOW pulse
 har ek ghadi pulse main sankhya ek-ek number se badhati he, jab tak vah 1001 tak gin leti he
 When increasing to 1010, both the NAND gate input goes into the HIGH state and the NAND output goes into the LOW position
 d imput kaa LOW hona CARRY OUT signal mana ja saktaa he jab 10 tak ginti ho chuki ho
 Ring counter ring counter ek chakradhari shift register he jo tab shuru hota he jab uskaa ek flip-flope HIGH avasthaa main hota he or baaki flip-flope LOW dasha main hote hai
 The ring counter is a shift resistor in which the output of the previous flip-flop is connected to the input of the next flip-flop, ie in cycle form
 aam taur par ek ekal bit se milakar ek pattern vitarit kiya jaataa he taaki har n ghadi chakra ke liye dasha n baar doharaaya jaye, agar n flip-flope kaa istamaal kiya gaya ho

 The term RAM is often related to volatile or volatile type memory memory modules) where information is lost when power is stopped operating
 adhiktar rome or nor-flash kahe jane vaale ek prakaar ke flash memory sahit kai anya prakaar kii memory ram bhi he
 There are two types of RAM
 static RAM aur daynemic RAM hoti he
 An early type of massively writeable random-access memory was magnetic core memory developed from the years 1949 to 1952 and later most computers until the development of static and dynamic integrated RAM circuits in the late 1960s and early 1970s
 It was used in isse pehle, "mukhya" memory prakaaryon ko karyanvit karne ke liye computaron main riley, vilamb line memory yaa vibhinn prakaar kii vaikum tub vyavasthaaon kaa istemaal hota tha jinamein se kuch yadrichhik abhigam hote the or kuch nahin
 vaikum tub tryod se or baad main asatat transister se nirmit kundiyon ko apekshaakrit chote or tej memory jaise yadrichhik-abhigam register bainkon or registeron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 Prior to the development of integrated ROM circuits, permanent random-access memory was often constructed using semiconductor diode matrices driven by address decoders
 aadhunik prakaar ke riteble ram aam taur par data kaa ek bit yaa to flip-flop avasthaa main jaise esaram, yaa kisi sandharitra main aavesh ke rup main jaise diram, ipirome, iipirome or flash main sangrahit karte hai
 Some types have circuitry to detect and / or repair random faults called memory errors in stored data using parity bits or error correction codes
 read-only prakaar ke ram, rome, aavesh kaa bhandaaran karne ke bajaay chaynit transistaron ko sthaayee rup se sakriy / niskriy karne ke liye dhaatu ke ek mask kaa prayog karata he
 Since both ASRAM and DIRAM are unstable, other forms of computer storage, such as disks and magnetic tapes, are used as permanent storage in traditional computers
 kai nae utpaada data ke rakrakhaav ke liye iske bajaay flash memory par nirbhar rahete hai jab unka upyog nahin hota he jaise pidie yaa laghu sangeet vadak
 kuch vyaktigat computaron, jaise kai tej computaron or netbukon ne chumbakeey discon ko bhi flash drivon ke saath badal diya he
 With flash memory, only the nor type is capable of true random access, allowing direct code execution and is therefore often used instead of ROM; The low-cost NAND type is typically used for bulk storage in memory cards and solid-state drives
 microprocesar kii tarah, memory chip bhi lakhon transistaron or sandharitron se milakar bana ek ekikrut paripath ) hota he
 The most common form of computer memory, dynamic random access memory), combines a transistor and a capacitor to form a memory cell that represents only one bit of data

 transister ek switch kii tarah kaam karata he jo memory chip kii niyantran circuitary ko sandharitra ko padhane yaa uski avasthaa main parivartan karne kii anumati pradaan karata he
 Many computer systems have a memory hierarchy that includes CPU registers, on-die asraum cache, external cache, dieram, paging system, and virtual memory or swap space of a hard drive
 memory ke is samgr pool ko kai developaron dwaara "ram" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he, yahaan tak ki vibhinn upatantron main ram main yadrichhik abhigam sangya se pare mul avadharana kaa ulanghan karte hue bilkul alag-alag abhigam samay ho saktaa he
 Even under a hierarchy level such as DIRAM, special rows, columns, banks, ranks, channels, or intergroup associations of components make the access time variable, although not to the extent that the recurring storage medium or tape becomes variable
 The overall goal of using the memory hierarchy is to achieve the maximum possible average access performance while reducing the total cost of the entire memory system, following the registers and access times with slower hard drives below)
 kai aadhunik vyaktigat computaron main, ram, modul ke ek sahaj unnat rup main aati he, jinhen memory modul yaa diram modul kehete hai or jinka aakaar lagbhag chuing gam ke tukdon ke samaan hota he
 These can be replaced immediately when they are damaged or when more storage capacity is required due to changing requirements
 jaisaa ki upar suzav diya gaya he, kam maatra vaali ram ) ko hard-drivon, sidi-rome or computer tantra ke kai duusare hisson ke saath-saath sipiu or madraboard ke anya isi main bhi ekikrut kiya jaataa he
 Many CPU architectures and operating systems are capable of performing a task known as "swapping" if a computer slows down on RAM during a rapid application cycle
 gamagaman ek prishthan fil kaa upyog karata he jo asthaayee rup se atirikt kaaryakari memory ke rup main prayukt hard drive kaa ek kshetra he
 Continuous use of this mechanism is called thrashing and is generally undesirable because it slows down the overall performance of the system, mainly because hard drives are much slower than RAM
 read-rhite kii kshamta rakhane vaale anya bhautik upkarnon ke naam main "ram" kaa prayog ho saktaa he: udhaaharan ke taur par, dividi-ram 
ek anukraman vidhi kaa naam bhi "yadrichhik abhigam" he: isiilie discs bhandaaran ko aksar "yadrichhik abhigam" # fil or input / output, platform, maanak sanskaran # yadrichhik abhigam]], anukramit fil) kaha jaataa he kyonki pathan sira, data ke ek bhaag se duusare bhaag main apekshaakrit turant gati kar saktaa he or iske bich ke sabhi data ko padhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 However, the final "M" is important: "RAM") always refers to solid-state equipment
 ram praayah computer kii mukhya kaaryakari memory ke sandarbh main online baatcheet kaa ek ashulipi yaa sankshep lekh he
 Software can "partition" a portion of a computer's RAM and allow it to act as a faster hard drive called a RAM disk
 yadi prayukt memory non-volatile na ho, to computer ko band karne par ram discs main sangrahit data kho jaataa he
 However, volatile memory can keep its data intact when the computer shuts down if it has a separate power-source, usually a battery
 kabhi-kabhi, apekshaakrit kam abhigam samay kii suvidha praapt karne ke liye rome kii samagriyon ko esaram yaa diram main pratilipit kar diya jaataa he dhimi ho sakati he)
 uske baad rome chip ko niskriy kar diya jaataa he jab inishilised memory sthanon ko badalakar pate ke usee khand main sthapit kar diya jaataa he
 This process is commonly used in both computer and embedded systems, sometimes called shadowing
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan ke taur par, vishisht vyaktigat computer ke bios main praayah "shadow bios kaa prayog karen" kahalaane vaala ek vikalp yaa usee tarah kaa koi vikalp hota he
 Once activated, the functions based on the data of the BIOS ROM will use the DRAM locations instead
 Depending on the sister, this may or may not result in increased performance
 kuch tantron main laabh kaalpanik ho saktaa he kyonki pratyaksh hardware abhigam ke paksh main booting karne ke baad bios kaa upyog nahin hota he
 Of course, some less free memory is available when shadowing is active

 chumbakeey surang prabhaav kaa upyog karke carbon nanotub or drushtikon yukt praudyogikiyon kaa prayog hua
 In the first-generation MIRAM, a 128-kilobyte magnetic RAM) chip was manufactured in the summer of 2003 with 0
18 μm of technology
 june 2004 main, ]] ne phir 0
18 μm praudyogiki par aadhaarit ek 16 mabibite prototip kaa udghaatan kiya
 Two second generation technologies are currently under development: Thermal Assisted Switching) which is being developed by]] and spin torque transfer) on which]],]], IBM and several other companies are working
 ]] ne san 2004 main ek kriyasheel carbon nanotub memory prototip 10 ) saarini kaa nirmaan kiya
 Whether or not some of these technologies will eventually gain a significant share of the market either from DRAAM, ASRAM or from flash-memory technology remains to be seen, however
 san 2006 ke baad se, "thos avasthaa vaale drive" uplabdh ho gaye hai jinaki kshamta 64 gigabite se adhik or kaary-nishpaadan paaramparik discon se kahin adhik he
 This development has begun to blur the definition between traditional random access memory and "disk" and has narrowed their performance gap in particular
 plastic chumbakon ke kshetra main bhi sakriy anusandhan hua he jo prakaash par aadhaarit chumbakeey vipareetata main pher-badal karte hai
 Some types of random access memory such as "ecorem" have been specifically designed for server farms where low power consumption is more important than speed
 "memory kii diwaar", sipiu or sipiu chip ke baahar sthit memory ke bich kii gati kii bad rahi vipareetata he
 One of the main reasons for this contrast is the limited communication bandwidth outside the chip boundaries
 varsh 1986 se 2000 tak, sipiu kii gati main 55% kii vaarshik dar se sudhaar hua jabaki memory kii gati main keval 10% kaa hi sudhaar hua
 Given these trends, it was expected that memory latency would become a major hindrance in computer performance
 vartmaan main, kuch had tak pramukh bhautik baadhaon ke kaaran or kuch had tak vartmaan sipiu dizin dwaara kuch arthon main pehle se hi memory kii diwaar ko prabhavit karne ke kaaran sipiu kii gati ke sudhaar main kaaphi kami ai he
 Intel has briefly revealed these reasons in its Platform 2015 documentation)
 "sabase pehle, chunki chip kii jyamiti simat gai he or clock kii aavritiyon main vruddhi hui he isliye maujuuda transister ke risaav main vruddhi hui he jiske parinamswaroop bijli kii khapat or garmi main tezi aa jaati he
 

 Secondly, the advantages of faster clock speeds are somewhat negated by memory latency because memory access time has not been able to keep pace with the clock's increasing frequencies
 teesri baat yah he ki kuch anuprayogon ke liye paaramparik dharawahik architekchar kam sakasham hote ja rahe hai jabaki procesar main tezi aa rahi he or iske saath-saath yah laabh ko bhi kam kar de rahe hai taaki aavriti vruddhi ko kisi duusare tareeke se karidaa ja sake
 iske atirikt, kuch had tak thosavastha vaale upkarnon ke tahat prerakta ke utpaadan ke sadhano main seemabaddhata ke kaaran, sanket sancharan main pratirodh-dharita ) kii vilambtaa main vruddhi ho rahi he kyonki suvidha ke aakaar chote ho gaye he jo ek atirikt aadchan daal rahaa he jisase aavriti kii vruddhi kaa pataa nahin chalata he
 " sanket sancharan main aarasi kii vilambtaa ko clock dar banaam ipisi : paaramparik microarchitekchar ke maarg kaa ant main bhi darj kiya gaya he jo san 2000 or san 2014 ke bich vaarshik sipiu kaary-nishpaadan sudhaar main adhik-se-adhik ausatan 12
5% kaa anumaan prastut karata he
 Data from Intel processors clearly shows that recently the performance improvement of the processor has decreased
 baharhaal, pichley ]] processron kii tulana main intel ke nae processron, ]] main kaaphi sudhaar dikhaai diya he; adhik sakasham architekchar ke kaaran kaary-nishpaadan main vruddhi hui he jabaki clock dar main giravat ai he
 Unlike ordinary models, modern SDRAM materials are not immediately lost when the computer is turned off; Rather, the material disappears, a process that takes only a few seconds at room temperature but which can be increased to minutes at a lower temperature
 yahi vajah he ki kisi bhi sangrahit data ko saadhaaran kaaryakari memory modul) main punah praapt karnaa sambhav he
 This is sometimes referred to as a cold boot attack aka ice-man attack

 inkaa naam ke kaaran 'paraphin' padaa he
 Hydrocarbons contain only carbon and hydrogen
 paraphin hydrocarbon petroleum, prakritik gas or anya khanij telon main paae jate hai
 The paraffin of the simplest structure is methane, which is found in coal-gas in the coal mine, gas from the marshes, and in the precipitates from the sewage residues
 kuch paudhon ke mom sadrush avyavon main bhi paraphin hydrocarbon paaya jaataa he
 Paraffin in hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain the maximum amount of hydrogen
 inhen 'sanyukt hydrocarbon' bhi kehete hai
 Scientists have named them alphabetically
 paraphin yogicon kii ek shrenee banaate hai, jinka nirupan vyapak sutara, Cn H2n+2, se hota he
 It has n = 1, 2, 3, xxrep 8 
 iske yogicon ke carbon parmaanu sidhi rekhaon main, athwa sashaakh shrunkhalaaon main, sambhddha ho sakate hai
 This type of binding leads to isomerization in such compounds
 paraphin ke nirmaan kii vidhiyon main se kuch nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Paraffin is formed by heating sodium salt of a fatty acid with soda lime, as revealed by the following formula: rcoona + naoh --> RH + na2co3 2
 Aqueous electrification of a fatty acid solution of sodium or potassium salts by Kolbe's method can produce all other paraffins in addition to methane
 3
 alkil hellide ke shushk ether main sodium yaa jaste se kriya karne se, Reduction of alkyl halide with zinc-copper or aluminum-mercury coupler and ethanol and alkil hellide ko band naliyon main hydrodic amla or laal phasporas ke saath garam karne se
 4
 By the Savatya – Sendrence method, paraffins are also obtained from reduction of hydronidic acid to hydronidic acid and hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons
 5
 pani se tanukrut khanij amlon, alcohalon tathaa alkil hellidon dwaara magnesium alkil hellide ke vighatan se bhi paraphin praapt hoti he
 In the category of paraffin compounds the molecular weight of the compounds increases as the specific gravity, melting and boiling points of the compounds also increase
 paraphins ke pratham chaar yogic gas, uske baad ke 11 yogic drav or shesh sabhi yogic thos hote hai
 Paraffins do not dissolve in water, but in solvents without hydroxyl
 rasayanat: ye niskriy hote hai
 They are infested with only a few reagents, such as halogen and oxidants, some of which have the following reactions: hellojanon se : CH4 + X2 -> CH3 x + HX yahan = fluorine, chlorine bromine yaa astatin he
 Halogen replaces one or all atoms of hydrogen
 RH + H2SO4 --> RSO3H + HOH From nitric acid: CH4 + HNO4 --> CH4NO4 + HOH From sulfuryl chloride: C4H10 + SO2 Cl2 --> C4H2SO2 + Cl + hcl Oxidation of paraffins produces water and carbon dioxide and emits a lot of heat
 adhik garm karne par paraphin do yaa do se adhik padaartho main vighatit ho jate hai
 In the presence of catalysts at high temperatures, they areomerize
 paraphin mom koi nishchit yogic nahin he
 It is a mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons of paraffin class
 hydrocarbonon main 21 se 60 tak carbon parmaanu paae gaye hai
 Hydrocarbons with predominantly normal and diffused chains remain, but hydrocarbons with closed chains are not excluded at all
 petroleum main teen pratishat tak mom rahata he
 This is called paraffin wax
 jab petroleum kaa aswan hota he tab adhikansh mom "snehan tel' main aa jaataa he
 In a vacuum, or in the presence of steam, the amount of distillate obtained from distillation can range from 40 to 50 percent
 at: aise asut ko mom asut kehete hen
 Up to 40 percent wax has been found in oil distillates in Southeast Asia, while no more than 10 percent wax remains in the crude distillate of Europe and America
 asut se mom nikaalane kii do pramukh reetiyaan hai
 In a manner the wax distillates the distillate sufficiently, causing the solid wax to separate from the liquid oil
 ab ise filter press main chaante hai
 Filter presses are of many types and of many leases and operate at different pressures
 yadi asut main mom kii maatra kam he to ek baar main hi adhikansh mom nikal jaataa he, anyathaa prakram ko kai baar doharaana padataa he
 Many types of wax can be obtained from this
 aise mom kii tikia main kuch tel rah jaataa he
 The amount of oil in the wax should not exceed 0
3 percent
 kachche mom se tel nikaalane ke vishisht yantra bane hai, jinhen 'swedak' kehete hai
 There are many types of Swadesak, but the principle of all of them is usually the same
 mom ko pighalaakar thandha karte hai
 Oil is collected in the pan of the vessel and taken out
