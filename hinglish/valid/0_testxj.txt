 Like its predecessors, Six Sigma asserts that - pichley gunvattta sudhaar pravartanon se sicks sigma ko alag karne vaali visheshtaon main shaamil hai - The term "six sigma" is derived from a field of statistics known as process capability studies

 In recent years, Six Sigma has sometimes been associated with unproductive manufacturing, resulting in a process called unproductive Six Sigma
 sigma kaa prayog, sankhyikeey jansankhya ke maanak vichlan kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The term "six sigma process" originated from the assumption that if one has six standard deviations between the construction-average and the nearest specified range, there would be practically no item that does not fit the specifications
 This process is based on the calculation method used in competence studies
 sakshmata adhyayan main, prakriya ausat or nikatatam vinirdisht seemaa ke bich ke in maanak vichalnon kii sankhya ko sigma ikaayiyon main diya jaataa he
 As the process standard deviation goes up, or the process average moves away from the center of the scope, much lower standard deviations will sit between the average and the nearest specified range, reducing the sigma number and increasing the probability of items outside the specification
 anubhav yah kahata he ki aam taur par prakriyaayein lambey samay main utana acha pradarshan nahin kar paati hai, jitna ki ve kam samay main karti hai
 As a result, compared to initial short-term studies, the number of sigmas that fit between the process average and the nearest specification limit is likely to decline over time
 samay ke saath-saath prakriya ghat-bad main vishuddh vruddhi ko darshane ke liye, praayogic aadhaar par pariklan main 1
5 sigma shift kaa pravartan kiya jaataa he
 According to this idea, the process that, during short-term study, sits six sigma between the process average and the nearest specified threshold, will only sit 4
5 sigma over the long term - because either the process average will change over time
 , Or the long-term standard deviation will be greater than the standard deviation of the process found during the short-term, or both are possible
 atah sicks sigma prakriya kii vyapak rup se sweekrut paribhaasha vah he, jo 3
4 abhavagrast bhaag prati das lakh avasar prastut karti he
 This is based on the fact that a normally distributed process will have 3
4 parts per million after a threshold, which will be 4
5 standard deviations above or below the average
 Thus, the 3
4 DPMO of the "six Sigma" process is actually similar to 4
5 Sigma, ie, 1
5 Sigma minus 6 Sigma to reflect long-term fluctuations
 Its design is to prevent underestimation of possible absence levels in pure operations
 alpavadhi sigma str nimnlikhit dirghakaalik DPMO mulyon ke anuroop hai: These data assume that the process average will shift to a part of the critical specification limit by 1
5 sigma shortly after the initial study, determining the short-term sigma level
 For example, the data given for 1 Sigma assumes that the short-term process average will be 0
5 sigma outside the specification range, not 1 sigma inside, as it was a short-term study
 sicks sigma kii do pradhan vidhiyaan hai: DMAIC or DMADV, donon deming ke yojana banaao-karrwai karo-jaancho-puraa karo chakra se prerit he

 One of the major innovations of Six Sigma is the commercialization of quality management functions
 Prior to Six Sigma, the practice of quality management was mostly transferred to the production department and to statisticians in a separate quality department

 Six Sigma identifies several key roles for its successful implementation
 sicks sigma badi sankhya main sthapit gunvattta prabandhan ke tareeqon kaa upyog karata he, jo sicks sigma ke baahar bhi prayukt hote hai
 The following table shows the major methods used
 sicks sigma ne udyog par baari prabhaav daalaa he or seva tathaa parichaalan utkrushtataa praapt karne or samposhit karne ke liye, ek vyapaar ranneeti ke rup main vyapak rup se prayukt hota he
 However, there are also many criticisms of Six Sigma
 prasiddh gunvattta visheshgy joseph em
juran ne sicks sigma ko "gunvattta sudhaar kaa buniyadi sanskaran," kaha he, yah batalaate hue ki "yahan kuch bhi nayaa nahin he
 This includes what we used to call an assistant
 unhone adhik alankrita shabdon ko apanaaya he, jaise vibhinn rangon kii belt
 mujhe lagata he ki avadharana main kuch li se hat kar karne kii kubi shaamil he, jisase aise visheshgy taiyaar hon, jo bahut madadgaar sabit ho sakate hai
 Still, this is not a new idea
 american socity for quality ne kaafii samay pehle hi pramaan-patron kaa srijan kiya, jaise ki vishwasaneey ejiniyaron ke liye
" The use of the "black belt" as an excursion-changing agent is controversial, as it has created a cottage industry of training and certification
 aalochak bahes karte hai ki adhikansh salaahkaar farmon dwaara sicks sigma kaa adhivikray ho rahaa he, jinamein adhikansh sicks sigma main visheshgyata kaa daawa karte hai, jabaki unhen keval prayukt upkaran or takanic kii praarambhik samaj hoti he
 The expansion of various "belts" such as "green belt", "master black belt" and "gold belt" is generally seen parallel to the various "belt factories" present in martial arts
 fortune ke ek lekh ne vivaran diya ki "sicks sigma kaarykram kii ghoshnaa karne vaali 58 badi companiyon main se 91 pratishat ne S&P500 ko peeche chhod diya he
 "the statement is credited to Charles Holland's analysis of the Qualpro consulting firm
" The essence of the article is that Six Sigma is effective in what it intends to do, but it is "fine-tuned to fix the current process
" Is designed "and it does not help" create new products or disruptive technologies "
 Many of these claims are based on erroneous or erroneous information
 Arguments are given
 bijnes wyk ke ek lekh main kaha gaya he ki james mekanerni dwaara sicks sigma ke 3M par parichay ne sambhawatah rachanaatmakataa kaa galaa ghonta he
 It exemplifies two Wharton school professors who state that Six Sigma performs incremental innovation at the cost of blue-sky work

 In addition, the Six Sigma model assumes that process data will always correspond to a normal distribution
 The calculation of the depletion rate for situations where the normal distribution model is not applicable has not been properly expressed in the prevailing Six Sigma literature
 apni manamaani prakruti ke kaaran, 1
5 sigma shift ko "behuda" ke rup main sankhyikivid donald je whealer dwaara khaarij kar diya gaya he
 Its universal applicability is seen as questionable
 1
5 sigma shift isliye bhi vivaadaaspad he ki yah ek nishchit "sigma str" main parinat hota he, jo dderghaavadhik ke badale alpavadhi ke nattejey ko pratibimbit karata he: ek prakriya jisamen 4
5 sigma nishpaadan ke kaaran dirghakaalik abhaav str hai, sicks sigma kii pratha ke anusaar, vah "6 sigma prakriya" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Hence the accepted Six Sigma calculation system cannot be considered equal to the actual normal distribution probabilities for the declared number of standard deviations, and this has been a major issue of controversy as to how Six Sigma measures are defined

 Pathik ji's father Hamir Singh Gurjar was also arrested by the government on charges of participating in the revolution
 pathik ji par unki maan camel kumari or parivaar kii krantikari va deshbhakti se paripurna prishthbhumi kaa bahut gaharaa asar padaa
 In his youth, he had contact with revolutionaries like Ras Bihari Bose and Shachindra Nath Sanyal
 1915 ke lahore shadyantr ke baad unhone apana asli naam bhupasingh gurjar se badal kar vijaisingh pathik rakh liya tha
 Till death, people knew him by this name
 mohandas karamchand gandhi ke satyagrah aandolan se bahut pehle unhone bijauliya kisaan andolan ke naam se kisaanon main swatantraaa ke prati alakh jagaane kaa kaam kiya tha
 In 1912, the British Government decided to move the capital of India from Calcutta to Delhi

 In 1915, revolutionaries in Lahore under the leadership of Ras Bihari Bose decided that an armed rebellion should be carried out on the lines of the 1857 revolution at various places in the country on 21 February
 bhartiya itihaas main ise gadar aandolan kehete hai
 The plan was that on the one hand the Indian British army should be encouraged to revolt and on the other hand the armies of the native kings would be supported in the rebellion

 At that time Pathik ji was absconding in the Ferozepur conspiracy case and was staying near Gopal Singh in Kharwa

 Unfortunately, the distinction of the nationwide scheme of revolutionaries was revealed to the British Government

 Pathik ji and Gopal Singh made ammunition underground and the soldiers were dispersed
 kuch hi dinon baad ajmer ke angrej kamishnar ne paanch sau sainikon ke saath pathik ji or gopal singh ko kharwa ke jangalon se giraftaar kar liya or tadgarh ke kile main najarband kar diya
 In those days, in the Lahore conspiracy case, Pathik ji's name emerged and orders were taken to take him to Lahore
 kisi tarah yah khabar pathik ji ko mil gai or wo tadgarh ke kile se faraar ho gaye
 To avoid arrest, Pathik ji made his disguise like Rajasthani Rajputs and started living in Chittorgarh area
 bijauliya se aaye ek sadhu seetaram das unase bahut prabhavit hue or unhonen pathik ji ko bijauliya aandolan kaa netritv sambhaalane ko aamantrit kiya
 Bijoulia was a destination in the princely state of Udaipur
 jahaan par kisaanon se baari maatra main malgujari vasuuli jaati thi or kisaanon kii dasha ati shochaneey thi
 Pathik ji reached Bijoulia in 1916 and took command of the movement in his hands
 prayek gaanv main kisaan panchayat kii shakhaayen kholi gai
 The main demands of the farmers were related to land tax, surcharges and forced labor
 kisaanon se 84 prakaar ke kar vasule jate the
 Apart from this, the war fund tax was also an important issue
 ek anya mudda sahukaaron se sambandhit bhi tha jo jamidaaron ke sahyog or sangrakshan se kisaanon ko nirantar lut rahe the
 The panchayat decided not to pay land tax

 Vijay Singh Pathik, through the letter Pratap, edited by Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi published from Kanpur, made the Bijolia peasant movement a topic of discussion all over the country
 1919 main amritsar congress main pathik ji ke praytn se bal gangadhar tilak ne bijauliya sambandhi prastaav rakhaa
 Pathik ji went to Bombay and narrated the compassion story of farmers to Gandhiji
 gandhi ji ne vachan diya ki yadi mewar sarkaar ne nyaay nahin kiya to vah swayan bijauliya satyagrah kaa sanchaalan karegein
 Mahatma Gandhi wrote a letter to Maharana to address the grievances of the farmers but no solution was found
 pathik ji ne bombay yatra ke samay gandhi ji kii pahal par yah nishchay kiya gaya ki wardha se rajasthan kesari naamak patr nikaala jaye
 The letter became popular all over the country, but Pathik ji did not match the ideology of Jamnalal Bajaj and he left Wardha and went to Ajmer
 1920 main pathik ji ke prayatnon se ajmer main rajasthan seva sangh kii sthapana hui
 Soon the branches of this institution opened up all over the state

 Ambush marketing or ambush marketing can be defined as a marketing strategy in which advertisers associate themselves with a particular program without paying a sponsorship fee and thus benefit from it
 macmillan angreji shabdkosh, ghaat vipanan ko ek aisi vipanan ranneeti ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisamen ek pratispardhi brands koi praayojan shulk die bina hi apane aap ko kisi badi khel ghatana ke saath jod letaa he
 According to mccarthy, ambush marketing is a type of marketing by a company that is not the official sponsor of an event, but which advertises using the event to attract the customer's attention to the advertisement
 ek saidhantik pariprekshya se, ghaat vipanan main company apane aap ko kisi vishesh aayojan ke saath jod kar isaki lokapriyata, saakh or pratishtha ko bhunaane kaa prayaas karti he, jabaki iske liye aavashyak party se sahamati nahin lee jaati
 The term "ambush", used in ambush marketing, means "ambush" and is derived from an old French verb ambushier, meaning "to put in a forest"
 The term "ambush marketing" was coined by eminent marketing strategist Jerry Welsh when he was acting as a manager of world-class marketing efforts for the American Express Company in the 1980s
 pratyaksh ghaat vipanan This includes things such as distributing free T-shirts in a sport without the permission of the sports organization

 Indirect ambush marketing aakasmik ghaat vipanan Customers come forward thinking that the company is the official sponsor of the event
 is samay unka lakshya hota he, media or aayojan ke aas paas ke televijan darshakon ke bade hue dhyaan kaa phayda uthaanaa, us par puunji lagaana

 isliye jab bhi yah vishistataa kho jaati he, praayojan kaa mulya bhi kho jaataa he
 When a company engages in ambush marketing, the sponsorship for the sponsor ends
 isliye, praayojan kaa mahatva bhi ghat jaataa he
 Because it is an indisputable fact that corporate sponsorship is one of the biggest money-making sources of revenue for the organizers of the event, a loss in the value of the sponsorship will affect the financial strength of the organizer

 The pylons were not part of the original design and were added only to allay the public's concern about the creative totality of the bridge

 Bradfield was appointed Chief Engineer of the Sydney Port Bridge and Metropolitan Railway construction, and his work on the scheme for many years earned him the legacy of the bridge's "father"
 At that time Bradfield was giving priority to a Bahudharan bridge with columns and in 1916 the NSW Legislative Assembly passed a bill for such a structure, but it could not proceed because the Legislative Council rejected the bill on the grounds that the money It would be better to spend in war effort

 Based on research conducted during his travels, Bradfield decided that the arc design could also be appropriate, and he and NSW officials from the Public Works Department built a single-arc bridge at the base of the Hale Gate Bridge in New York City
 Made simple design

 The arc design was cheaper than the proposals for alternative bracing and swinging bridges and was more rugged, making it more suitable for expected heavy-weight vehicles

 Coincidentally, the bridge was built with the construction of an underground railway system in Sydney's CBD, now called City Circle, and the bridge was designed with this in mind
 The bridge is designed to carry four routes of road traffic, which will have two rail tracks and a sidewalk on either side, both sets of rail tracks designed by symmetrical sloping paths and tunnels at the southern tip of the bridge to underground Vineyard Railway Station
 The railway tracks on the eastern side were connected to the use of a planned rail link connecting the northern centers; In the interim period, they were used to transport trams from the northern shore to a terminal located at Vineard Station and in 1958 when tram services were discontinued, they were converted to additional traffic routes
 Bradfield Highway, which is the bridge and the main roadway leading to it, pul kaa nirmaan bradfield ke prabandhan main tha
 Three other people who played a large role in the design and construction of the bridge were Laurence Ennis, Edward Judge and Sir Ralph Freeman
 Ennis Darman was the engineer-in-charge and chief supervisor at the construction site at Long & Co
, Judge Derman Long's technical engineer, and Freeman was brought in to design the company-approved sample in more detail, later from Bradfield and Freeman
 a bitter dispute arose over the issue of who actually designed the bridge
 Another name associated with the design of the bridge was Arthur Plunkett

 For construction on the northern side, an estimated 469 buildings, including private houses and commercial enterprises, were demolished, for which zero or negligible compensation was given
 The work of the bridge began with the construction of routes and stretches to reach it, and by September 1926 concrete columns supporting the stretches on both sides of the port were formed

 The construction of the arc itself was started on 26 October 1928
 The southern end of the bridge was built before the northern end, so that errors could be detected and their alignment helped
 Along with the construction of the arcs, the cranes proceeded along with them and eventually joined in the middle

 After the arc was completed, the creeper cranes were withdrawn from the arcs, making it possible to construct the roadway and other parts of the bridge outward from the center
 The vertical hangers were attached to the arc and were then joined to the cross beams parallel to the horizon
 Roofs for roadways and railroads were erected at the top of the cross beams and the roof itself was completed by June 1931 and the creeper cranes disbanded
 Tracks were laid for trains and trams and concrete was laid on the road and covered with asphalt
 In 1931, electrical and telephone lines, and water, gas and exhaust pipes were also installed on the bridge

 The total economic cost to build the bridge was $ 10 million

 The bridge was formally inaugurated on 19 March 1932
 Among those who attended the program and gave speeches were State Governor Sir Philip Game, Minister of Public Works and Ennis

 After official ceremonies, the public was allowed to walk across the bridge on the roof, which was not allowed to be done before the 50th birth anniversary celebrations
 According to estimates, from three lakh to one million people attended the inaugural ceremonies, which was a very large number, as the total population of Sydney at that time was only slightly more than a million

 Australia's biennial celebrations on 26 January 1988 attracted large crowds near the bridge when the celebratory porters flocked to the seashore to watch the events
 Its special event was the largest ever parade of ships in Sydney, with square riggers from all over the world passing gracefully under a Sydney harbor bridge surrounded by hundreds of small vessels of all kinds
 The day-long celebrations ended with a fireworks display with the bridge being the focal point of the final event and the firecrackers missing the arc and the roadway
