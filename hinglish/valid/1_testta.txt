 pracheen, 2
 Middle Carpet and 3
 aadhunik-
 Early literature is more important from the point of view of Bengal's life and its merits and demerits
 chandidas, krittivas, maladhar, pipalai, lochanda, gyaandas, kavikankan, mukundaram, krishnadas, kashiram das, bharatchandaray, gunakar aadi kavi isi kaal main hue hai
 Like other scholars of India, the scholars of Bengal used to give special importance to the works of Sanskrit
 unki drushti main vahi "amar bharti" kaa pad sushobhit kar sakati thi
 He considered colloquial language to be variable and temporary
 kintu jansadharan to apane vichaaron or bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye usee bhashaa ko pasand kar sakate the jo unke hriday ke adhik nikat ho
 They could teach and teach in the same language

 It can be called Nagar or Shaurseni Apabhransh, which was largely the language of western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Punjab and Rajasthan
 saamaanya janata ke liye in donon bhashaaon main thodaa sa sahitya vidyaman tha
 Songs of love and devotion, proverbs and folklore were found in the mother tongue
 buddha tathaa hindu dharm ke upadeshak janata main prachaar karne ke liye jo rachanaayen taiyaar karte the ve praaia: puraani banglaa tathaa nagar apbhransh, donon main hoti thim
 47 Chariyapads are of special importance in the available compositions of the ancient Bengali
 ye praaia: aath panktiyon ke rahasyamay geet hai jinka sambandh mahayan bauddhadharm tathaa nathpanth, donon se sambhddha gupt sampradaay se he
 Their common external meaning is often understood in this way and the deeper meaning can also be understood with the help of Sanskrit commentary, which was received with this collection as well as Sri Harprasad Shastri
 in geeton yaa padyon main "kavita" naam kii cheez to nahin he kintu jivan kii ekaadh jhalak avashya kisi kisi main dekh padati he
 Some other poetic compositions similar to this were also received from Nepal by Dr
 Prabodhchandra Bagchi and Rahul Sankrityayan etc
 " 12veen shatabdi ke ant tak puraatan banglaa main yathesht sahitya taiyaar ho chukaa tha jisase us samay ke ek bengali kavi ne yah garvokti kii thi "log jaisaa ganga main snaan karne se pavitra ho jate hai, vaise hi ve 'bengal vaani' main snaat hokar pavitra ho sakate hai
 "but unfortunately, apart from the said 47 Chariyapadas and few songs or verses, very few compositions of that period are available today
 gitgovind ke rachayita jayadev bengal ke hindu raja lakshmana sen ke shasankaal main vidyaman the
 There are 24 songs in this beautiful poem describing the love of Radha and Krishna, but not everyone is perfect
 sanskrit main praaia: tukant nahin miltaa
 This is the specialty of Apabhransh or the budding indo-aryan languages
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki in padon kii rachana mulat: puraani banglaa main yaa apbhransh main kii gai thi or phir unamem thodaa parivartan kar sanskrit ke anuroop bana diya gaya
 In this way Jayadeva can be considered a famous poet of ancient Bengal, who in addition to Sanskrit, probably composed in Old Bengali too
 jo ho, bengal ke kitne hi pargami kaviyon ko unase prerana mili, isamen andeh nahin
 There is no evidence that there has been a big poem written in the old Bengali
 us samay aisi rachanaayen bengal main bhi praaia: apbhransh main hi hoti thim
 However, when the famous poet Vidyapati of Mithila composed the famous historical poem, he also practiced it not in his mother tongue Maithili, but in Apabhramsa, although in between, the words Maithil have also been used

 It was during this period that the Bengali-speaking Muslim population emerged and grew gradually
 turk akramanakariyon main se bahuton ne bengal kii striyon se hi vivaah kar liya or dhire-dhire "yahan kii bhashaa, rahan sahan aadi ko" apana liya
 They forgot Turkish and Arabic remained the language of religion only

 When peace was established in Bengal after some time, when the study of Sanskrit, preaching etc
 was facilitated, then education and literature as if the primary renaissance started

 He was the first popular poet to present the Sanskrit Ramayana in Bengali, who portrayed Rama as Valmiki, not as a pure human and heroic man, but as a compassionate avatar of God, towards whom the heart of the simple devotional people is easily attracted could
 isi tarah krishnagtha kaa varnan usee shatabdi main maladhar basu ne kiya
 It is based on the Bhagavata Purana

 This story was probably prevalent before the arrival of Muslims, but the first story based on it was composed in Bengali in the 15th century
 inamen se ek ke rachayita vijaygupt or duusari ke vipradaas pipalai maane jate hai
 Chandidas, a famous poet of the pre-secondary Bengali, is considered
 inke naam se koi 1200 pad yaa kavitaayen prachlit hai
 There is so much difference in their language, style etc
 that they do not seem to be composed by the same person
 aisa prathit hota he ki madhyamik banglaa main is naam ke kam se kam teen kavi hue
 The first Chandidas were the pioneers of Srikrishnakirtan who existed before Chaitanya, around 1400 AD
 duusare chandidas dwij chandidas the jo chaitanya ke baad main yaa uttar kaal main hue
 He composed most of the songs of Radha Krishna's love interest that earned Chandidas such a popularity
 tisare chandidas deen chandidas hue jo sangrah ke teen chauthai bhaag ke rachayita prathit hote hai
 There is no doubt that the first two Chandidas were the mainstays of Chandidas's fame

 Mithila's Vidyapati also had a significant impact on this Vaishnava lyric literature of Bengal, which has been discussed earlier

 Mithila's kingdom was often untouched by Muslim invasions

 These songs of his became very popular in Bengal and he was composed in his imitation

 Vaishnava scholars and poets had prepared many collections of them, out of which Vaishnavadasa's "padalpataru" is particularly famous
 isamen 170 kaviyon dwaara rachit 3101 pad aae hai
 At the same time some religious stories were also written
 inamen ruparam krit dharmamangal vishesh prasiddh he jisamen lousian ke saahasik kaaryon kaa varnan he
 Manik Ganguly and Ghanram Chakraborty also presented compositions on the style of this story
 ek or kathanak jiske aadhaar par 17veen, 18veen shatee main rachanaayen prastut kii gayi, raja gopichand kaa he
 He was the son of King Manikchandra

 Therefore, he had to do the same by the mother's order

 Similarly, Sufi Muslims from the area of eastern Hindi reached East Bengal, they also took the Nagari alphabet with them

 Conservation agriculture is a completely new model of farming, with the help of which the environment is taken care of
 is anokhi tarah kii kheti main jameen ko yaa to bilkul bhi nahin jota jaataa yaa phir kam se kam jutai hoti he
 Crop plants are initially grown in nurseries
 saath hi, lager kii madad se jameen ko jabardast tareeke se samtal kiya jaataa he
 Above all, it uses modern methods of irrigation such as drips and sprinklers
 in tareekon kaa istemaal karke kheti main kaaphi munaafe kaa sauda ban sakati he
 Also, it increases the efficiency of the things used in agriculture
 isse laagat kam aati he or paidaavaar main kaaphi badhotaree hoti he
 All this benefits the farmers in the form of big profits
 ganga ke maidaanon ke kisaanon ke bich kheti kaa yah nayaa tarika kaaphi mashhoor ho rahaa he
 There is a big reason behind it, it is very good and beneficial
 ek jamaana tha, jab kheti kii vikaas gaatha main pani ke zyada istemaal, urvarak or urja kaa adhik istemaal karne vaali takneekon kii ahm bhoomika hua karti thi
 But now times are changing
 aaj krishi ke vikaas ke saath-saath is baat kaa bhi khaas khyaal rakhaa ja rahaa he ki inkaa istemaal kam se kam ho, taaki laagat kam hone ke saath-saath prakritik sansadhano or paryaavaran kii sehat par bhi iskaa bura asar na ho
 This new farming started around 2000
 haalanki, paaramparik rup se yah sochaa jaataa he ki jitne acchhee tareeke se kheton ko jota jaataa he, fasal utane hi acchhee hoti he
 But in this new type of farming, after cutting the previous crop, the land is left as it is
 nai fasal ke liye ek khaas tareeke ke bowai-yantra kii madad se kheton main chhed karke bijon ko ek nishchit gaharaai main bo diya jaataa he
 This not only saves hard work, but it also saves the energy spent in repeated plowing of fields
 is vajah se kaaphi samay bhi bachataa he
 This also gives a lot of time to prepare for the next crop
 isaki vajah se khar-patavaaron kaa khatra bhi kaaphi kam ho jaataa he
 The sowing of seeds at reasonable depths and the small drains around them allow water to reach them well
 isse pani kii barbaadi to kam hoti hi he
 Also, yields can also increase significantly
 lager se jameen ko samtal karnaa kaaphi aadhunik takanic sahi, lekin yah pichley kuch saalon main ai kaaphi phydemand takneekon main se ek he
 In this, the help of a special kind of machine is taken, which flattens the field completely using laser rays
 ek bilkul samtal jameen par pani, har paudhe tak samuchit maatra main jaataa he
 In a way, this is equivalent to guaranteeing a good crop throughout the field
 is vajah se pani kii bhi kaaphi zyada bachat hoti he
 In case of Kharif crop, this type of farming can save water up to 20 cm
 rabi fasalon ke maamle main yah bachat paanch semi tak kii hoti he
 The productivity of the land increases considerably due to conservation farming
 saath hi, yah pani, urja or jameen kii urvartaa kaa bhi puraa sangrakshan karti he
 Because of this, the cost is reduced by 20 to 30 percent
 isaki vajah se prati hectayar ausatan 2500 rupee kii bachat hoti he
 The important thing is that it is also very good for the environment
 saath hi, yah global varming or paryaavaran main aa rahe badlaavon ko bhi roak saktaa he
 If this new type of farming is used on a large scale, it can help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide
 asal main bina jute khet carbon dioxide ko sokh lete hai, jisase global varming ko kam karne main madad milti he

 dow0 namvar singh sabase adhik samay tak is ke sampadan se jude rahe hai
 Mostly through the publication of abstract and thought-provoking articles, effective intervention in various contemporary issues and the publication of many important issues, this magazine has made its own unique identity in the entire Hindi literature world
 'aalochana' kaa prakaashan multah aalochana kendrit ek tremasik saahitiyik patrika ke rup main oktober 1951 main aarambh hua tha
 Its founder editor was Shivdan Singh Chauhan
 apane aarambhik samay main hi aalochana ek shreshth patrika ke rup main sthapit ho gayi
 At the completion of one year of its publication, in the July 1952 issue, its editor Chauhan ji wrote in his editorial "one year of criticism came to an end
 is prakaashan kaa hindi sahitya main 'ek aitihaasik ghatana' ke rup main sarvatra swaagat kiya gaya
 "chauhan ji edited only 5 marks of criticism
 unke sampadan main prakashit itihaas visheshank kaaphi charchit hua tha
 "chauhanji was discharged in 1953 after the 'history Special Issue', the fifth issue of criticism
 " This was followed by the appointment of an editorial board comprising Dharmveer Bharti, Raghuvansh, Vijaydev Narayan Sahi and Brajeshwar Verma
 iske baad nandadulaare vaajapeyi aalochana ke sampadak bane
 "vajpayee ji took over the charge of 'criticism' from the 18th issue of April 1956 and carried it out till the 26th issue of April 1959
 " After this, Shivdan Singh Chauhan was again appointed editor of criticism and he remained its editor till 1966 AD
 ' may 1967 main "shila sandhu ne shivdaan singh chouhan ko hataakar namvar singh ko uskaa sampadak bana diya
 Shivdan Singh Chauhan was very hurt due to this and remained angry against Namwar for a long time
 unhen hindi sahitya kaa don or mafia tak kehete rahe
 " april-june 1967 ke ank ke saath naveen rup main aalochana kaa prakaashan aarambh hua tathaa iske sampadan kii bagdor dow0 namvar singh ne sanbhaali
 "the criticism that came out of his editing was considered the beginning of a new era in Hindi and was called Nawank-1
 " kai upsampadakon ke sahyog se dow0 namvar singh ke sampadan main "hindi-jagat ko vaicharik-twara pradaan karne vaali patrika 'aalochana' kaa prakaashan 1990 main iske 48wein ank ke prakaashan ke baad hi sthagit ho gaya
 "the last issue of criticism was in april-june of 1990
 apane sampadan ke aarambhik samay main hi acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi kii shashtipurti ke uplakshya main dow0 namvar singh ne un par kendrit 'aalochana' kaa ek visheshank nikaala
 Then also focused on Muktibodh

 As a precaution, Namvar ji had spoken of his name being printed as editor only after seeing his work in the first few digits, but Vishnu Khare made his name as editor only in the printing of the second issue of his edits
 Insisted on being given and an editorial printed in his name
 namvar ji ne uske chhapane kii sweekruti nahin di or is kaaran vishnu khare ke sampadan kaa vah prasang vahiin par ruk gaya
 In 1980, he was made the co-editor of Nandkishore Naval Criticism from issue 54-55 and he carried out this responsibility well till issue 76
 naval ji namvar ji ke athmiya the, parantu san 1985 main apurvanand ne nagarjun ke vichaaron kii tikhi pratikriya main 'nagarjun kii raajnneeti' naamak pustika likhi or uski bhoomika nandakishor naval ne likhi
 This was Naval ji's bitter comment to Nagarjuna, "which made Namvar ji angry and decided to immediately separate Naval ji from the co-editor
 parinamswaroop aalochana ke prabandh sampadak shila sandhu ke dwaara naval ji ko sah sampadak pad se hataa diya gaya
 From issue 77, its co-editor was made famous critic Paramanand Shrivastava
 janvari-june 1981 kaa ank nagarjun par kendrit ank ke rup main nikaala gaya
 Many specific points of criticism came out in the editor-in-chief of Namvar ji, but due to the writing of his writing and many other engagements, he was not able to give enough time for criticism, the editorial was not able to reach at the same time
 prabandh sampadak shila sandhu ke shabdon main "ankon kii saamagree tathaa sampadakeey samay se na milane ke kaaran vilambit prakaashan, samay yaa saamagree kii dushwariyon ke kaaran bilawajeh sanyuktaankon kaa prakaashan, dhire-dhire patrika kaa nijee swaroop na ban paane kii pathakeey shikaayatein aadi aadi tamaam aisi vyavhaarik baaten thim jinke kaaran kabhi-kabhi unase samvadaheenata kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati thi
 "and eventually the publication of the criticism ceased with the april-june 1990 issue
 puraa ek dashak biit jane ke baad san 2000 isvi ke april-june ank se hi aalochana kaa punarnava rup main punah prakaashan aarambh hua or ise 'sahasrabdi ank ek' kaa naam diya gaya
 Namvar Singh was named as its editor-in-chief and Paramanand Srivastava was made the editor
 aravind treepathi sah sampadak ke rup main jude
 Nawank-1 of 'criticism', which began in the editing of Namvar Singh nearly three decades ago, first warned of the fascist threat in India and after such a long gap, the 'millennium issue of criticism' is also a 'fascism and culture' The crisis was centered on the theme itself
 vyapak hindi jagat ke anekanek shreshth lekhakon ke aalekhon se sambalit punarnava aalochana kaa yah samrudh ank kaaphi lokapriy hua or may 2001 main hi prakaashak ko isko punarmudrit kar prakashit karnaa padaa
 In the editing of Parmanand Shrivastava, this magazine again regained its ancient glory and remained one of the best magazines of Hindi literature
 haalaanki iskaa paanchava ank kaaphi kukhyat rahaa
 This special issue, organized on the anniversary of Ram Vilas Sharma, was seen by Namvar Singh as an open opposition to Ram Vilas Sharma and it was quoted as saying in the editorial of Namvar Singh that "what cannot be hidden in the above lines of Namvar Singh
 , He is opposed to Ram Vilas ji being called 'rishi' and his 'sadhana' getting public acceptance
 yahi vah mul badaniyat he, jisaki prerana se ramvilas sharma kii barsi par yah ank pryojit kiya gaya he
 "however, other than this issue, its other marks were excellent
 saamaanya ank bhi vishisht ank kii tarah mahatvapurn
