 manorog vigyaan yaa manorog vidya chikitsa kshetra kii ek visheshgyata he jo manovikaron kaa adhyayan karti he
 Psychology is a new science of the modern era
 20veen sadi main hi is vigyaan ke vibhinn angon main mahatv kii khojein hui hai
 Till the 19th century, various types of psychosis were considered diseases that had no relation to the general practitioner
 jatil manovikar kii avasthaa main rogi ko maansik chikitsaalayon main rakh diya jaataa tha, taaki vah samaaj ke duusare logon kaa koi nuksaan na kar sake
 There was no special treatment in these hospitals
 chikitsakon ko vastav main uski chikitsa ke vishay main spasht gyaan hi na tha ki chikitsa kaise kii jaay
 Now the situation has changed
 manovikar vigyaan ko ek andhiyaari kothri nahin maan liya gaya he, jiskaa sambandh thode se manoveekshipt logon se he, varan yah vigyaan itnaa mahatv kaa vishay mana gaya he ki iskaa samuchit gyaan na keval kushal shaareerik chikitsak ko, varan samaaj ke prayek sevak or kaaryakarta, shikshak, samajasudharak tathaa raajnneetik netaa ko bhi hona aavashyak he
 Not only this, every well-educated citizen also needs its knowledge
 yadi koi prabal manovikar man main aa gaya or hamen uskaa gyaan nahin hua, to ham usase mukt hone ke liye kisi visheshgy kii sahaayta bhi na le sakenge
 Any person, who is perfectly healthy and whose wisdom is praised by all people, can become deranged by losing the balance of his mind at any time
 phir vah samaaj ke liye nikamma ho jaataa he
 a person should know such situations so that he does not fall into some kind of extraordinary mental state, that is, he does not suffer from mental illness
 phir maansik chikitsa karaane ke liye bhi manovikar vigyaan main shraddha hona aavashyak he
 Psychological science developed to meet the special needs of humans
 yah 20veen shatabdi kii ek vishesh dein kaa parinaam he
 In this century, there has been an unthinkable increase in the efficiency and happiness of human beings
 uski taarkik shakti or vaigyanik chamatkaar atyadhik bad gaye hai
 Along with this, his mental activities have increased many times already
 yah kori bakawaad nahin hai ki pratibha or paagalpan ek duusare ke poorak hai
 Along with intellectual development, dementia also develops
 vigyaan sukhad samagriyon main vruddhi karata he, to du:khad paristhitiyon kaa bhi srijan karata he
 It creates a new mental confusion as well as a reconciliation of external conditions
 ek ore vigyaan manushya kii suraksha badha detaa he, to duusari ore achintya chintaaon ko bhi utpann kar detaa he
 Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the 20th century is a century of insanity
 yadi isane veikshiptata ko badhaayaa he, to uske shaman ke vishesh upaay khojna bhi isi kaa kaam he
 As much as the country is progressing in civilization, there are more anti-cancer doctors and hospitals in it
 atev manovikaron ke nivaaran hetu anek prakaar kii manovaigyanik khojein maanavvigyaan ke vibhinn kshetron main ho rahi he
 Before Dr
 Freud, doctors used to use only physical medicines for the treatment of mental diseases
 kuch log in rogon ko shant karne ke liye tantropchaar kaa upyog karte the
 Belief and instruction are the basis of mechanism
 aaj bhi is vidhi kaa upyog gramin ashikshit logon main adhiktar hota he
 The famous Belgian psychologist Dr
 Messmer made extensive use of hypnosis and instruction in the treatment of mental diseases
 isse manojaat shaareerik rogon kaa bhi nivaaran hota tha
 Scholars named Braun Heim and Sharco of France showed the usefulness of Sammohan in monsoon
 rogi apni sanmohit avasthaa main dabi maansik bhaavana ko ugal detaa tha or is prakaar ke rechan se vah rogamukt bhi ho jaataa tha
 Dr
 Emile Couyé of Nenson, France, used instruction in the treatment of mental diseases, but not all these methods led to a special advancement of psychiatry
 iske liye man kaa gambhir prayogtmak adhyayan karnaa aavashyak tha
 This work was done by Dr
 Freud
 ab yah mana jane laga ki man kii vibhinnataaon kaa gyaan kiye bina or unamem chalanevaali prakriyaaon ke jane bina kisi bhi vyakti ko uske manovikar se mukt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to Dr
 Freud there are three levels of the mind: conscious, subconscious and unconscious
 man teen prakaar ke kaary bhi karata he : ichchhaaon kaa nirmaan, unka niyantran or unki santushti
 The first work is of the dependent mind, the second work is of the moral mind and the third work is of the ego
 ichchhaaon kaa janm praaia: achetan str par hota he, unka niyantran avchetan par or unki santushti chetan str par hoti he
 Conflict often goes on in the human mind and moral mind
 jab yah sangharsh manushya kii chetana main chalata he, tab vah du:khadaayak chaahe jitna bhi ho par rog kaa kaaran nahin banataa, kintu jab prayatnpurvak kathorta se kisi prabal ichha kaa daman naitik man ke dwaara ho jaataa he, tab sangharsh maansik chetana ke str par na hokar manushya ke achetan man main hone lagata he
 The existence of this struggle is mental disease and freeing the person from this struggle is his mental therapy, which is the goal of psychiatry
 iske liye rogi ko maansik shithilikaran kii avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he or phir use apane apriy athwa aniatik anubhavon ko samaran karne kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 For this, some people still use the Sammohan method, but Freud used to psychoanalyze the patient
 is vidhi main rogi ko shant or shithil avasthaa main laakar man main aanevaale sabhi vichaaron or chitron ko kehete jane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 In this way, sometimes the patient tells very unpleasant experiences
 jab ve anubhav puure sajiv ho jate hai or rogi unke anusaar lajja, glani, harsh, vishaad kaa usee prakaar anubhav karata he, jaisaa pehali baar kiya tha, tab uske bhaavon kaa rechan ho jaataa or rog ke anek lakshan samaapt ho jate hai
 The patient does not benefit from blank intellectual memory, but from living memory of old experiences, that is, emotional memory
 jab kisi damit bhav kaa rechna hota he, tab vah pehle pahal maansik chikitsak par hi aropit ho jaataa he
 It is absolutely necessary for the patient to have affection towards the doctor to come out of the feeling
 jab tak rogi or chikitsak main hriday kii ekta nahin hoti, damit ichha avchetana ke str par aati hi nahin
 Then this affection increases day by day
 jaise jaise chikitsak par rogi kii shraddha badhati jaati he, uskaa rog kam hota jaataa he
 While getting rid of his disease, the patient loves the doctor very much
 is pyaar kaa badhanaa or rogamukti ek hi tathy ke do pahalu hai
 Now it is the duty of the physician to turn the impulse of the love of the patient to its proper character, or to use it in some constructive work
 chikitsak rogi ko bhavatmak rachanaavlamban praapt karaane kaa prayaas karata rahata he
 He encourages him to increase his knowledge
 rogi ko rogamukt tabhi samajha ja saktaa he, jab vah na keval rog ke sabhi lakshanon se mukt ho gaya ho, varan use bhavatmak swaavlamban or aatm sujh praapt ho gaye hon
 Psychology is the means to attain this mood
 maansik chikitsavigyaan kii nai khojein manovigyaan ke atirikt duusari dishaao main bhi hui hai
 There are two main among these: maansik rogi ke man main sangharsh chalate rahane ke kaaran vah anidra kaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 Now if such a person is put to sleep in any way, then it is possible that his disease becomes light
 maansik rogi ko do sthalon par sadaa ladate rahanaa padataa he, ek bhitari or duusari bahari
 He has external and internal worries
 iske kaaran vah asaadhaaran rukaawat kaa anubhav karata he
 This causes him to lose sleep
 neend ke kho jane se uski thakaavat or bhi bad jaati he or phir vah paagalpan kii sthiti main aa jaataa he
 If she starts feeling sleepy, then her mental strength will get accumulated and she will be able to solve her external problems
 iske baad uski bhitari samasyaon kii bhayankarta bhi kam ho jaati he
 Therefore, whichever patient can make the patient sleep, it is beneficial for him
 iske liye bhartiya ayuvedic oshadhi sarpgandha he, yaa allopathic vidhi se bani nidra laanevaali tikia hai
 a person suffering from complex mental diseases is sometimes brought to unconscious state
 iske liye use insulin kaa injection diya jaataa he
 After giving it, the patient flings around and expresses physical cramps
 baar baar injection dene par rogi kii tod phod, marpet kii pravriti shant ho jaati he
 His mind is in a state of relaxation
 isse phir rogi swaabhaavik rup se swasthya laabh karata he
 Similar treatment is also done by electric shaking
 inase rogi ko ardhachetan athwa achetan avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he
 His efforts symbolically repel repressed emotions
 jatil rogiyon ke upachaar main praaia: bijli ke jhatkon se hi kaam liya jaataa he
 When they were first used, there was great hope from this treatment method, but all these hopes were not fulfilled
 kuch maansik rogon kii chikitsa prakritik dhang se bhi hoti he
 When the patient abandons his complex work and starts feeling relaxed in nature, then he gets mental equilibrium automatically
 hamaari vartmaan sabhyataa main saamaajik tanaav ke avasar atyadhik bad gaye hai
 When a man abandons his normal routine and starts to give rest to his mind, then he gets well
 da yung ke kathanusaar rog manushya ko aaraam kii aavashyaktaa darshane ke liye aata he
 He teaches her the lesson of subduing her desires
 edward karcenter ke anusaar hamaari vartmaan sabhyataa hi maansik rog he
 It removes us from natural life
 yah hamaari ichchhaaon ko itnaa badha detii he ki unki purti main ham sadaa apane aapako dubo dete hai
 The method by which these vain desires are lacking, is the best remedy for mental health
 atev prakritik jivan maanas-rog-nivaaran kaa uttam upaay he
 Psychological science not only has a place of natural life, but also of religion
 anek maansik vikaar trishna kii vruddhi se or sanyam kii kami se utpann hote hai
 Religion inhibits the growth of craving and increases restraint
 atev vah anek prakaar ke manovikaron ko paidaa hi nahin hone detaa
 Secondly, religion is essentially related to literature and art
 inke dwaara manushya kii nimna koti kii ichchhaaon kaa udasikaran hota rahata he
 Due to this, there is no conflict between these desires and moral intelligence of man and there is no opportunity for the formation of mental glands
 manovikar vigyaan is prakaar hamaari drushti maanav samaaj main prachlit jivan ke un puraane tareekon or mulyon kii ore pher detaa he, jinke hraas ke kaaran manushya ko anek prakaar ke maansik klesh bhogane padate hai
 The social values and culture that will be built with the help of this knowledge will provide permanent health to the life of man
 isi aashaa se is vigyaan kaa vistaar na keval maansik chikitsakon dwaara ho rahaa he, varan sabhi samaaj-kalyaan-chintakon dwaara ho rahaa he
 Psychiatry in India is still in a less developed state
 manorogon ke bare main aam vyakti kii jaankaree galat dharanaon se bhari he
 Even in today's scientific era, ghosts, upper shadows, deities, weather, constellations, luck, fruits of bad deeds etc
 are considered to be the cause of these diseases
 isliye ojha, pujari, maulavee, sadhu, nakli vaidya, neem-hakim, aprashikshit yon-visheshgy ityadi avaigyanik rup se manorog chikitsakon kaa kaary kar rahe hai
 General practitioners and medical specialists are often unable to identify psychiatrists at the right time and send patients to the psychiatrist
 iske kai kaaran hai; jinke pramukh hai : dhan lolupata, aparyaapt jaankaree, aparyaapt prashikshan, manochikitsakon kii kami, garibi, rogi yaa uske rishtedaaron dwaara manorog ko sweekaar na karnaa, aadi
 Newspapers and other media have also failed to give accurate information about the psychiatrists

 There are only about 4000 psychiatric doctors in India with more than 100 crore population

 Political philosophers have been embroiled in intense debates over the question of the essence and structure of law
 kanoon ke vidwaanon ko maanavshaastra, raajnneetik arthshaastra, natikshastra or vidhaayi mulya-pranali kaa adhyayan bhi karnaa padataa he
 The notion of 'rule of law' prevails in liberal democracies operating on a constitutional basis
 in vyavasthaaon main kanoon ke daayre ke baahar koi kaam nahin karata, na vyakti or na hi sarkaar
 Behind this is the liberal principle of law according to which the purpose of law is not to impose restrictions on the person but to guarantee his freedom
 udaarataavaadi siddhant maanata he ki kanoon ke bina vyaktigat aacharan ko sanyamit karnaa naammumkin ho jayega or ek ke adhikaron ko duusare ke haathon hanan se bachaaya nahin ja sakegaa
 Thus in the language of John Locke, law means the law to protect life, liberty and property
 udaarataavaadi siddhant spasht karata he ki kanoon ke banane or lagu karne ke tareeke koun-koun se hone chahie
 For example, the law should be made through mutual consultation by elected lawmakers
 duusare, koi kanoon pichhali tarikh se lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki us surat main vah nagarikon ko un kaamon ke liye dandit karegaa jo tatkaaleen kanoon ke mutabik kiye gayi the
 Similarly, liberal law is against the punishment of cruel and inhuman kind
 raajnneetik prabhaavon se nirpeksh rahane vaali ek nishpaksh nyaaypalika kii sthapana kii jaati he taaki kanoon kii vyavasthit vyakhya karte hue pakshakaron ke bich uske aadhaar par faisalaa ho sake
 Marxists believe that the concept of rule of law works in the name of guaranteeing individual freedom while protecting property rights and protecting the capitalist system
 iskaa nateeja saamaajik vishmata or vargeey prabhutv ko banaaye rakhane main nikalataa he
 Marx considers law like politics and ideology to be part of a superstructure or superstructure whose base or basis is laid on the method of capitalist production
 nariwadiyon ne bhi kanoon ke shashan kii avadharana kii aalochana kii he ki vah langik nishpakshta par aadhaarit nahin he
 That is why the judiciary and the profession of law are occupied by men
 bahusamskritwad ke pairokaron kaa tark he ki kanoon asal main prabhutvshaalee saanskrithik samoohon ke mulyon or ravaiyon kii numaaindgi hi karata he
 As a result, the values and concerns of minority and marginalized groups continue to be ignored
 kanoon or naitikta ke bich antar ke sawaal par darshanik shuru se hi sir khapate rahe hai
 The basis of law is the belief of those who believe in the moral system, in the principle of 'natural law'
 plato or unke baad arestu kii manyata thi ki kanoon or naitikta main nazadiiki rishta hota he
 a just society can only be one in which the laws affirm wisdom based on moral rules
 madhyayugin isai vichaarak thomas equina bhi maanate the ki is dharti par uttam jivan vyateet karne ke liye natural lau yani ishwar pradutt naitiktaaon ke mutabik kanoon hone chahie
 In the nineteenth century, the theory of natural law became ineffective as the prestige of rationalism and scientific outlook increased
 kanoon ko naitik, dharmik or rahasywaadee manyataon se mukt karne kii koshishen huin
 John Austin established 'legal positivism' which claimed that the law was concerned not with a higher moral or religious principle, but with a sovereign person or institution
 kanoon isliye kanoon he ki uskaa paalan karavaaya jaataa he or karnaa padataa he
 HLA is a far more practical and naive interpretation of legal positivism
 Hart's work is found in 'the Concept of Law'
 heart kanoon ko naitik niyamon ke daayre se nikaal kar maanav samaaj ke sandarbh main paribhaashit karte hai
 According to him, law is a combination of first and secondary rules
 pratham shrenee ke niyamon ko 'kanoon ke saar' kii sangya dete hue heart kehete hai ki unka sambandh saamaajik vyavhaar ke viniman se he
 Like, foreclosure law
 dwitiya shrenee ke niyam sarkari sansthaaon ko hidaayat dete hai ki kanoon kis tarah banaaya jaae, unka kis tarah karyanvayan kiya jaae, kis tarah uske aadhaar par faisale kiye jaaen or in aadhaaron par kis tarah uski vaidhata sthapit kii jaae
 The theory of legal positivism propounded by Hart has been criticized by political philosopher Ronold Dwarkin
 unke anusaar kanoon keval niyamon kii samhita hi nahin hota or na hi aadhunik vidhi pranaliyaan kanoon kii vaidhata sthapit karne ke liye kisi ek samaan tareeke kaa praavdhaan karti hai
 The debate between the law and morality also arose in the Nuremberg lawsuit punishing the atrocities of the Nazis
 prashn yah tha ki kya un kaamon ko aparaadh tehraaya ja saktaa he jo rashtriya kanoon ke mutabik kiye gayi hon? iske jawaab ke liye prakritik kanoon kii avadharana kaa sahaara liya gaya, lekin uski abhivyakti maanavadhikaron kii bhashaa main hui
 Indeed, the question of the relationship between law and morality is highly complex and continues to arise in the context of issues such as abortion, prostitution, pornography, violence in TV and films, mother-of-the-womb, and genetic engineering

 The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture, and described as a remarkable feat of engineering with a climbing series of tiered gardens with a variety of trees, shrubs and vines It resembles a large green mountain made of mud bricks, it was located near the Iraqi city of al-hilah
 is udyaan kaa nirmaan naboochadnejaar dwitiya ne isa se 600 varsh purv karavaaya tha
 This garden was completely destroyed in an earthquake 2 century BC
 iskaa naam greek shabd cremastose se liya gaya he, jiskaa aadhunik angreji shabd he "latakaana" 
 It refers to trees planted on raised structures such as a roof
 ek puranic katha ke anusaar, hanging garden ko unki maharani rani amitis ke liye nio-babylonian raja nabookadanessar dwitiya dwaara da maarval of mainkind naamak ek bhavy mahal ke saath banaaya gaya tha, kyonki vah apni mathrubhumi kii hari pahadiyon or ghaatiyon ko yaad karti thim
 There are five lead authors whose descriptions exist today that discuss the shape of the Hanging Garden, its overall design, and the means of irrigation, that "why it was built" Josephus describes the garden about Berossus, the Babylonian priest of Marduk Written, whose writings are the earliest mention of gardens around 290 BCE
 diodoras sikulas ne clitarcus or kanidias ke katasius donon ke chauthi shatabdi isa purv granthon se paraamarsh liya he
 Diodorus explains the creation of a Syrian king
 unke anusaar bageeche ek varg ke aakaar main tha, prayek paksh ke saath lagbhag chaar Plethora lanbaa
 The garden was tiered, the gallery above was 50 cubits high
 deevaaren, 22 feet moti, eent se bane the
 Quintus Curius Rufus probably arrived at the same sources as Diodorus
 unke anusaar bageeche ek garh ke sheersh par sthit the, jo paridhi main 20 stadium tha
 He attributes the construction of the gardens to the Syrian king, for the reason that his queen was missing her homeland
 strabo ne apana bayaan sambhavat: 4 veen shatabdi isa purv se onecetritas ke khoe gaye khate par apana vivaran aadhaarit kiya tha
 According to him the orchard was watered through Archimedes' screw leading to the gardens of the Euphrates River
 philo ke anusaar, yah nirmaan gahari mitti ke vishaal kshetron ke nirmaan kii ejineering or saralata ke kaaran tha| Due to the lack of documentation in contemporary Babylonian sources, it is unclear whether hanging gardens were actual constructions or poetic constructions
 nabookadanessar kii patni amitis kaa bhi koi ullekh nahin he kai record nabookadanessar ke kaamon main maujuud hai, phir bhi unke lambey or purna shilalekhon main kisi bhi bageeche kaa ullekh nahin he
 Herodotus, who had described Babylon in his history, also did not mention the Hanging Gardens
 However, the gardens were said to exist even later when the authors described them, and some of these accounts were attributed to Babylon
 Is believed to be derived from people visiting
 haalanki yah ho saktaa he ki bageeche unki yatra ke samay greek logon ke liye jane-maane nahin the
 To date, no archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon for the Hanging Gardens
 yah sambhav he ki saboot euphrates ke neeche maujuud hai, jinhen vartmaan main surakshit rup se kholaa nahin ja saktaa he
 At the time of Nebuchadnezzar II the river flowed east of its present position, and little was known about the western part of Babylon
 rollinger ne suzav diya he ki borosus ne garden ko raajnneetik kaarnon se nebuchadnessar ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha, or unhone anya jagahon se puranic kathaon ko apanaaya tha
 One proposal is that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were actually built by the Assyrian king Sennacherib for his palace at Nineveh
 steffni daali kaa maananaa he ki madhyavarti shatabdiyon ke dauraan donon site uljhan main ain, or sanherib ke mahal ke vistrut bageeche ko nabookadanessar dwitiya ke babul ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya gaya

 American football is a popular sport played between two teams of eleven players, in which each team aims to score points by placing the ball in the other team's "end zone"
 jis team ke paas gend par qabza hota he, vah gend ke saath daudkar yaa apane saathiyon main aapas main gend phenkakar use virdohi team ke oundzon tak badhaane kii koshish karti he
 If a player from that team crosses the goal line by holding the ball and reaches the opposing endzone, or successfully catches the ball thrown by his partner standing inside the endzone or two behind the goal line from the field If he delivers the ball by kicking it between the poles, then his team gets points
 virdohi team kaa kaam he ki takkar markar, giraakar, yaa bich main aakar phenki gai gend ko pakadakar kisi tarah gend par qabza kare yaa dushman team ko apni team ke oundzon kii taraf badhane se roke
 American football is played mostly in the United States and Canada
 iske khel ko vyavsaayik str par niyantrit karne vaali santhaan kaa naam "naishanal footbaal lig" he, jise chote rup main chhanalfail kaha jaataa he
 In the US, there are two main forms of the sport, college football and professional football, whose rules differ slightly from one another
 skulon kii ucch kakshaon main bhi footbaal kheli jaati he or uske niyam bhi thode bhinn hote hai
 The playground is 100 ghz long and 53
3 ghz wide
 maidan kii lambaai ke donon taraf ek gol kii lakeer hoti he, jiske aage das-das gaz ke oundzon hote hai, yani kul milakar maidan kii lambaai 120 gaz hoti he
 There is a streak called Yardline at every five Gaz distances in the field
 har oundzon ke akhir main zamin se 10 foot kii oonchaai par do khambe hote hai jinhen "goalpost" kaha jaataa he
 Every team can have 11 players on the field at any time, but teams have the right to change one or all of their players at any given time in the game
 isliye footbaal ek visheshgy khilaadiyon kaa khel he
 In any team, there are actually many players, which are divided into three types: the attacking player, the defending player and the special player
 kuch khilaadi to tiimon main sirf isliye rakhe jaate hai ki agar unke hi hunar vaale kisi khilaadi ko chot lag jaae to unhen unke sthaan par daalaa ja sake
 In most cases, many players of any team do not get the chance to get into the field
 jis team ke paas gend par qabza ho, use "aakraamak" bulaayaa jaataa he or jis ke paas na ho use "rakshak" bulaayaa jaataa he
 The most important player on the offensive team is called the quarterback
 jab akramak or rakshakon main bhidnt shuru karti he to isi kaa kaam he ki tezi se maidan kaa muina karke faisalaa kare ki akramak team kaa koun-sa khilaadi gend ko rakshak team ke oundzon kii taraf badhaane ke liye sabase acchhee sthiti main maujuud he
 Then the quarterback tosses the ball to him, or himself runs away and tries to push the ball forward
 khel kaa puraa samay ek ghanta hota he, jise chaar 15 minute ki chauthaiyon main baanta jaataa he
 The second quarter is followed by a 12-minute break
 khelte hue kai baar gend ruk jaati he or tab khel kii ghadi bhi roak di jaati he
 a quarter of 15 minutes can actually take more than 45 minutes, and a full one-hour game can actually run more than three hours
 jab khel television par prasaarit hota he to in antaraalon main prasarankarta ishtehaar dikhaate hai
 At the beginning of the match, the coin is tossed and a team is declared an offensive team and they are given the ball
 ab 50 gaz kii lakeer par donon timen ek dusre se bhidane ke liye aamane-saamne lakeeren banaakar khadi ho jaati hai
 The quarterback of the offensive team stands behind his team
 maahaul thik aisa hota he ki do gut jang ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hon
 The game begins when the ball reaches the hands of the offensive quarterback
 foran rakshak team ke khilaadi us tak pahunch kar use dhane kii ziddo-jahad main lag jate hai
 Some aggressive players try to stop them by confronting them, while the rest of the aggressors enter the opponent's field and try to put themselves in a good position to move the ball forward
 quarterbaque ke paas kuch hi kshan hote hai jisamen use faisalaa karnaa hota he: kis saathi ko gend phenken yaa phir khud rasta dhundta hua aage bhaage
 In a few moments, the defending players of the count, who defend him, reach the quarterback by banging or pushing them
 agar gend quarterbaque ke haath main ho or use daboch diya jaae to ise "sac" kehete hai or kisi bhi quarterbaque ke liye yah bahut sharmnaak mana jaataa he
 Being sacked more often means that the quarterback was unable to think between skirmishes: he is weak and not capable of leading the aggressors
 chaahe quarterbaque gend kisi ko phenke, chaahe khud use lekar bade, aam taur se rakshak thodi hi duuri par gendwale aakraamak khilaadi ko dha hi lete hai or gend ruk jaati he
 This condition is called down
 aakraamakon kaa kaam he kii 4 dounon main gend ko kam-se-kam 10 gaz badhayen
 If they cannot do so, the defenders are taken possession of the ball and the defenders now become aggressive and the offensive defenders
 gend kaa qabza tab bhi badal jaataa he agar kisi aakraamak ke haath se khelte hue gend chhot jaae or koi rakshak us hilti hue gend ko pakad le yaa phir quarterbaque kisi anya aakraamak khilaadi ko gend phenke or koi rakshak bich main aakar use pakad le 
 In the event of a fumble or interception, the defender who has caught the ball may immediately start running towards the opponent's endzone and run until it is dropped, pushed out of the ground, or he Do not score points for your team by reaching the endzone
 jab gend ruukti he to yah bade dhyaan se mapa jaataa he kii 100 gaz ke maidan main yah kaunse gaz par he
 The next play is started in the middle of the field at the same Ghaz
 is jagah ko "bhidane kii lakeer" kaha jaataa he
 As stated, the aim of the offensive team is that the ball moves 10 yards in four or less downs
 farz kijiye ke ve do hi dounon main gend ko 10 gaz aage badha len
 So it is said that he is again on the first down and now he has to raise the ball 10 yards in four downs again with this new scrimmage streak
 yah silsilaa tab tak chalata he jab tak aakraamak rakshakon ke oundzon tak na pahunch jaaen yaa galati karke virdohi ko gend kaa qabza na de den
 Players are also changed in the game which is interrupted when the occupation is changed
 bahut se aakraamak khilaadi daudane main or phenki gai gend pakadaney main nipun hote hai or aksar unke sharir halake hote hai
 Many defenders are terrific and most offensive-specific players are difficult to pick up if they are caught or slammed
 acha aakraamak vahi he jise quarterbaque dwaara phenki gai gend ko bina galati ke pakadana aata ho or jo bhaagate hue rakshakon ko chakma dete hue dushman ke kshetra main dur tak gend badha sake
 The job of some aggressors is to take on defenders so that others can take the offensive ball forward
 inkaa naam hi "oinsive tekal" hota he
 1801 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 1801 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
