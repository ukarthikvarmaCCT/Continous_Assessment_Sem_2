 On the basis of this belief, Bell, with the help of his assistant Tomas Watson, started an effort to invent the telephone method and finally on March 10, 1876, he was able to make such an instrument that he sent a message to Watson
 Sent - Mr
 Watson, come here

 Around the same time, some other people in the United States were experimenting with the transmission of eloquence by Vidyudhi and Prof
 a scientist named Elisha Gray applied only to patent one of his instruments, just three hours after Bell was granted an application to patent his instrument

 Photosynthesis is the process in which plants produce carbon dioxide from the air and water from the ground in the presence of sunlight through their green limbs, such as leaves, to produce complex organic foods such as carbohydrates and exclude oxygen gases
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya main surya ke prakaash kii upasthiti main paudhon kii hari pattiyon kii konshikaon ke andar carbon diaksaide or pani ke sanyog se pehle saadhaaran carbohydrate or baad main jatil kabohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he
 In this process, oxygen and energy-rich carbohydrates, etc
) are produced and the oxygen gas comes out
 jal, carbondioxide, surya kaa prakaash tathaa chlorophyl ko prakaash sanshleshan kaa avyav kehete hai
 Out of this, water and carbon dioxide are called raw materials of photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya sabase mahatvapurn jaivaracinic abhikriyaaon main se ek he
 All the living beings of the world directly or indirectly depend on it
 prakaash sanshveshan karne vaale sajivon ko swaposhi kehete hai
 Light does not participate in the reaction here, rather the presence of light is necessary for this reaction
 is rasinic kriya main carbondioxide ke 6 anuon or jal ke 12 anuon ke bich rasinic kriya hoti he jiske falswaroop glucose ke ek anu, jal ke 6 anu tathaa oksijan ke 6 anu utpann hote hai
 In this activity, the main product is glucose, and oxygen and water are released as a substance

 In photosynthesis, solar energy of about 100 terawatts per year is tied up as chemical energy into food molecules
 is urja kaa pariman puri maanav sabhyataa ke vaarshik urja kharch se bhi 7 guna adhik he
 This energy is stored here as potential energy
 atah prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya ko urja bandhan kii kriya bhi kehete hai
 Thus photosynthetic organisms convert about 10,00,00,00,000 tonnes of carbon into biomass every year
 bahut pracheen kaal se yah gyaat he ki paudhe apana poshan jadon dwaara praapt karte hai
 In 1772, Stephen Helles stated that the leaves of plants take food from the air and light has some important function in this activity
 pristle ne 1772 main pehle bataaya ki is kriya ke dauraan utpann vaayu main mombatti jalaai jaye to yah jalati rahati he
 If a living mouse is placed in the air generated after burning the candle, it dies
 usne 1775 main punah bataaya ki paudhon dwaara din ke samay main nikali gas oxygen hoti he
 After this, the engine house stated in 1779 that green plants consume co2 in sunlight and remove oxygen
 di
 saasuur ne 1804 main bataaya paudhe din or raat shwasan me to oxijan hi lete he par prakaash sanshleshan ke dauran oxijan mukt karte he
 Therefore, oxygen is used throughout the day, but oxygen is made only by photosynthesis with carbon dioxide
 saas ne 1887 main bataaya ki hare paudhon ke co2 grahan karne tathaa o2 nikaalane se paudhon main starch kaa nirmaan hota he
 The process of photosynthesis occurring in green plants is a very important activity for plants and other living beings
 is kriya main paudhe surya ke prakaashiya urja ko rasinic urja main parivartit kar dete hai tathaa CO2 pani jaise saadhaaran padaarthon se jatil carbon yogic carbohydrates ban jate hai
 It is only through these carbohydrates that humans and living beings get food
 is prakaar paudhe prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya dwaara sampoorn praani jagat ke liye bhojan-vyavastha karte hai
 Various crops are grown to obtain carbohydrates, proteins and vitamins etc
 and all these substances are produced by photosynthesis
 rabad, plastic, tel, celulos evam kai aushadhiyaan bhi paudhon main prakaash sanshleshan kriya main utpann hoti he
 Green trees take carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis and remove oxygen, thus purifying the atmosphere
 oxigen sabhi jantuon ko saans lene ke liye ati aavashyak he
 This action is also very important for the protection of the environment
 matsay-paalan ke liye bhi prakaash sanshleshan kaa bahut mahatv he
 When the process of photosynthesis slows down, the amount of carbon dioxide in water increases

 Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary and opposite to each other
 prakaash-sanshleshan main carbondioxide or jal ke bich rasinic kriya ke falswaroop glucose kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxigen mukt hoti he
 Oxidation of glucose in respiration, in turn, results in water and carbon dioxide
 prakaash-sanshleshan ek rachanaatmak kriya he iske falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main vruddhi hoti he
 Respiration is a nasal activity, which results in a decrease in the dry weight of living organisms

 is prakaar ye donon kriyaaye apane kachche maal ke liye ek duusare ke ant padaarthon par nirbhar rahete hue ek duusare kii poorak hoti hai
 Photosynthesis takes place only from green plants and the equation is very simple
 phir bhi yah ek vivadagrast prashn he ki kis prakaar CO2 evam pani jaise saral padaarth, carbohydrates jaise jatil padaarthon kaa nirmaan karte hai
 From time to time, various plant technology experts have expressed different views to understand this activity
 inamen baiyar, willstator tathaa stall tathaa aranon ke mat pramukh hai
 The votes of Baird, Wilsetter and Staal have only historical significance
 inako baad ke pareekshanon main sahi nahin paaya gaya
 In 1967, Arnone reported that the protein found in the chloroplast had a major function in photosynthesis
 aadhunik yug main sabhi vaigyanikon dwaara yah maanya he ki prakaash sanshleshan main swatantra oxygen pani se aati he
 On the basis of many experiments in modern times, it has been proved that the process of photosynthesis takes place in the following two stages
 pehle charan main prakaash prakriya athwa hill prakriya athwa photochemical prakriya
 And in the second stage the dark process or the Blackman process or the lightless process
 prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main donon prakriyaayen ek duusare ke pashchaat hoti he
 The light process ignores the dark process more quickly
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya paudhe ke sabhi chloroplast yukt koshikaon main hoti he
 That means all the green parts of the plant
 yah kriya visheshtah pattiyon ke mesophil utak main hoti he kyonki pattiyon ke mesophil utak kii perenima koshikaon main anya koshikaon kii upeksha chloroplast kii maatra adhik hoti he
 The process of photosynthesis that takes place in the presence of light is studied under light action
 is kriya ko hill aadi anya vaigyanikon dwaara adhyayan kiya gaya
 Dark processes act as a limiting factor when lighting processes
 prakaash prakriyaayen do charnon main hoti hai, photolysis evam hydrogen kaa sthaapan
 In the process of photolysis, light is absorbed as a photon by a molecule of chlorophyll
 jab chlorophyl kaa anu ek kwantem prakaash shoshit kar letaa he uske pashchaat chlorophyl kaa doosraa anu tab tak prakaash shoshit nahin karata he jab tak ki pehali urja prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya main prayog nahin ho jaati he
 Photons of light thus absorbed by chlorophyll ejects an electron at high energy levels and this power is located on the third bond of phosphate and appears as high-energy adenosine triphosphate
 is prakaar chloropil prakaash kii upasthiti main atipi utpann karte hai tathaa is prakriya ko phosphorailation kehete hai
 In this way, the energy of sunlight is converted into ATP, ie chemical energy
 is prakaar chlorophyl anu main nirmit atipi chlorophyl anu se pruthak hokar CO2 ko sharkara main anoksikrut hone aadi anek rasinic kriyaaon main sahaayak he
 Chlorophyll becomes inert again upon freeing this ATP
 vaan nil frank, vishanik ke anusaar pani jab is kriyasheel chlorophyl ke sampark main aate hai tab pani anoksikrut h tathaa tej oxykaarak OH main vichchhedit ho jaataa he
 Chlorophyll + Light → Activated Chlorophyll H2O + Activated Chlorophyll → h + + OH- In this photolysis process O2 is liberated from water and hydrogen also moves to the hydrogen subscriber
 2H2O + 2A → 2AH2 + O2 is prakaar paudhon kii prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriyaayon se nikali samast oxygen jal se praapt hoti hai
 Hill, Reuben supported it and proved it using O18
 pani se oxygen nikalne ko chlorilla naamak shaiwal main CO2 kii anupasthiti main dikhaaya gaya
 This means that oxygen can be produced in the absence of CO2, but it must have hydrogen content
 aisa dekha gaya he ki paudhon main enedipi do NADPH2 banaata he
 2H2O + 2NADP = 2NADPH2 + O2 aranan ke matanusaar prakaash kriya mukhya rup se nirmaan se sambandhit he
 NADPH2 / NADP is formed by degradation
 NADP ko TPN bhi kehete hai
 ATP is a light energy molecule formed by the joining of a phosphate group in ADP and this action is called phosphorylation
 edipi ke phosforilation main prakaash urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he atah ise photo-phosforilation bhi kehete hai
 It is also a complex process and according to Aranan the lighting process takes place in two processes
 ayugma photo-phosforilation tathaa yugma photo-phosforileshvyugma photo-phosforilation main pani ke apghaton ke kaaran electron nirantar praapt hote he tathaa photo-phosforilation kii kriya par chlorophyl main prakaash urja se atipi kaa nirmaan hota rahata he
 Thus upon activation of chlorophyll 'a', ferredoxin acts as an electron receptor to give a coenzyme called NADP in which NAD is converted to NADPH2 by capturing hydrogen released by water
 is prakaar pani main vighatan main hue mukt electron chlorophyl ‘b’ ko uttejit kar ucch urja str par pahoonch jate hai tathaa ye electron phir kas prakaar chlorophyl ‘a’ ko praapt hote hai, purna rup se gyaat nahin he lekin aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki plastokavinon naamak electron grahi in electronon ko pakad letaa he jo cytochrome dwaara punah chlorophyl ‘a’ main pahunch jate hai
 It also produces ATP simultaneously
 yugma photo-phosforilation kii kriya main surya ke prakaash se chlorophyl ‘a’ sakriy hokar electron ko baahar kii ore phankta he jo chlorophyl main upasthit ferydoxin dwaara pakad liye jate hai
 This electron is liberated and is captured by an electron receptor called plastoquinone
 is kriya ke madhya main edipi, atipi main parivartit ho jaataa he tathaa electron punah mukt hokar cytochrome vikar se hokar chlorophyl ‘a’ main vaapis pahunch jaataa he
 In this action also, ADP is converted into ATP
 is kriya main bahari electron prayog nahin hota tathaa chlorophyl se electron nikalakar punah vahiin vaapis aa jaataa he
 In this way water is decomposed by paired and combustion processes, which liberates oxygen gas and is captured by hydrogen, hydrogen receptor NADP as well as energy classified which is used in chemical process or unpublished reaction
 
 oxigen tathaa prakaash-sanshleshan This process does not require light
 is prakriya main praayah carbondioxide kaa avkaran hota he
 In this process, the carbon dioxide absorbed by the stomata of the leaf, due to the energy of hydrogen light released from the water, forms a permanent liquid
 CH2O, yah ek carbohydrates kii ikai anu he
 Calvin and Banson reported using radioisotropic techniques that the first permanent compound in the photosynthesis process was a 3-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acid
 chlorolla evam sindesmas naamak shaiwalon main radio active C14O2 kii upasthiti main kuch samay ke liye prakaash-sanshleshan karaayaa gaya tathaa inamen bhi pehla sthai dravya phosphoglicerick amla bana
 This phosphoglyceric acid subsequently forms glucose
 is prakaar kelvin tathaa uske sahakarmiyon ke kaaryon se yah siddh ho gaya ki prakaash-sanshleshan prakriya main CO2 glucose main parivartit ho jaati he
 He used isotopes of carbon in this experiment
 chlorophyl main ribuloj-1,5 visphosphate upasthit rahata he
 Now atmospheric CO2 penetrates through the leaf stomata and enters immediately, forming a temporary compound with ribulose-1,5 visphosphate
 is prakaar bana asthai yogic jo 5-carbon sugar he sheeghra hi phosphoglaicerick acid ke 2 anuon main tut jaataa he
 Now here, when hydrogen is released by NADPH2, it converts PGA to PGAL
 is kriya main urja atipi se praapt hoti he
 In this way CO2 creates carbohydrates
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii andheri prakriya main jin paudhon main pehla sthai yogic phosphoglissrik amla banataa he unhen C3 paudha kehete hai
 Phosphoglyceric acid is a 3-carbon additive, hence these plants are named so
 jin paudhon main pehla sthai yogic 4 carbon vaala yogic banataa he unako C4 paudha kehete hai
 The compound with 4 carbons is usually oxaloacetic acid
 pehle aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki prakaash-sanshleshan main carbondioxide ke sthirikaran yaa yogikeekaran ke samay keval C3 yaa kelvin chakra hi hota tha arthath pehla sthai yogic phosphoglissrik amla hi banataa he
 But in 1966 Hatch and Slack pointed out that there is also a second path for the stabilization of carbon dioxide
 unhone ganna, makka, ameranthus aadi paudhon main adhyayan kar bataaya ki phosphoinol piruvik amla jo ki 3 carbon visisth yogic he carbondioxide se sanyukt hokar 4 carbon visisth yogic oxaloecetic amla banaata he
 In this activity, phosphoinol acts as a pyruvate carboxylase enzyme catalyst
 prakaash-sanshneshan kii kriya main chaar mukhya avyav hai, jal, carbondioxide, prakaash evam parn harim
 The presence of these four is very important for this action
 inamen se jal evam carbondioxide ko prakaash-sanshleshan kaa kaccha maal kehete hai kyonki inke rachanaatmak avyavon dwaara hi prakaash-sanshleshan ke mukhya utpaada carbohydrate kii rachana hoti he
 The plant takes these ingredients from the environment around them
 carbondioxide prakaash-sanshleshan kaa ek mukhya avyav tathaa kaccha padaarth he
 Carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere is released by the actions of respiration, combustion, fermentation, dissolution etc

 Terrestrial plants take it directly from the air
 in paudhon kii pattiyon main chote chhidr hote hai jinhe parnarandhra kehete hai
 Carbon dioxide enters the leaves of the plant from these same foliage
 jalmagn paudhe jal main ghuli carbondioxide ko apni shaareerik sataha se visaran dwaara grahan karte hai
 The sources of carbon dioxide in water are aquatic animals, whose gases are produced in respiration
 jal ke bheetar chattaanon main upasthit carbonate tathaa bicarbonate ke vighatan se bhi carbondioxide utpann hoti he jisko jaleey paudhe prakaash-sanshleshan main grahan karte hai

 balb aadi ke teevr kritrim prakaash main bhi prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya hoti he
 This activity is most common in red light
 laal ke baad begni rang ke prakaash main yah kriya sabase adhik hoti he
 Both these colors are absorbed by chlorophyll in the greatest amount
 hare rang ko chlorophyl puri tarah paravartit kar dete hai atah har rang ke prakaash main prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya puri tarah ruuk jaati he
 Water is the raw material for photosynthesis

 The molecules of hydrogen are obtained from water in the glucose molecules formed in the half reaction
 prakaash-sanshleshan ke samay jal apratyaksh rup se bhi kai kaary karata he
 It maintains activity of organisms and activation of enzymes
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya anek karkon dwaara prabhavit hoti he
 Some of its factors are external and some are internal
 iske atirikt kuch seemaabaddh kaarak bhi hote hai
 External causes are those that affect photosynthesis while being located in nature and environment, such as light, since the plant receives energy for this activity from sunlight and this action is not possible from darkness
 carbondai oxide, kyon ki aisa dekha gaya he ki yadi anya sabhi kaarak paudhe ko ucchtam maatra main praapt hon tathaa vayumandal main CO2 kii maatra dhire-dhire badhaai jaye to prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar bhi bad jaati he
 Temperature, because it has been observed that a certain temperature is also required for photosynthesis in plants and water is very important for water photochemical processes and it supports many chemical changes during this process
 aantarik kaaran ve hote hai jo pattiyon main sthit hote hue prakaash sanshleshan kii kriya ko prabhavit karte hai jaise- parnaharith yaa chlorophil jiske dwaara prakaash urja rasinic urja main parivartit hoti he
 Pruss / organism / protoplasm in which wickers are found affect the photosynthesis

 The internal structure of the leaves is because the rate of photosynthesis depends on the number of stomata or stomata present in the leaves and their closing and opening time
 pattiyon kii aayu, kyon ki nai pattiyon main puraani pattiyon kii apkshaa prakaash-sanshleshan kii dar adhik hoti he
 In addition, the photosynthesis also affects the different speeds of all these objects
 jab prakaash sanshleshan kii ek kriya vibhinn karkon dwaara niyantrit hoti he tab prakaash sanshleshan kii gati sabase mand kaarak dwaara niyantrit hoti he
 Whatever is less than the appropriate amount of light, carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll etc
, it controls the speed of the whole action

 Both these questions are divided into 11–11 tables, in which 32 and 29 Kandikas are received respectively
 yahi ek kalpasutra he jisaki shrout, grihy, dharm or shulbasutra yukt purna kalp–parampara uplabdh he; par un sabhi kaa kartta ek hi he yaa nahin, yah kahana kathin he
 According to the opinion of Mahamahopadhyay Pandurang Vaman Kane, the principal of both the householder and Dharmasutra are the same
 smritichandrika in donon ko hi ek granthkaar kii kriti maanati he
 Buehler and Führer also have no doubt in this matter
 kintu oldenberg ke anusaar aapstamb shrautasutra tathaa aapstamb dharmasutra ke rachiyata bhinn–bhinn vyakti hai
 Many parts of the Boudhayan Dharmasutra have a resemblance to the Aastambha Dharmasutra, but it is difficult to say who has taken the material
 mahamahopadyay kane aapstamb dharmasutra ko boudhayan se parvarti maanate hai
 Banerjee has long criticized the subject
 isse gyaat hota he ki unhone donon granthon kii mantra–sampatti kii tulanaatmak samiksha kii he
 The connection of the Apastamba Dharmasutra appears to be from South India, as the Apastamba branch was prevalent in the south of the Narmada, according to the verses quoted from the composition called 'maharnava'
 swayan aapstamb ne dharmasutragat shraadh ke prakaran main brahmanon ke haath main jal giraane kii pratha 'uttar ke logon main' prachlit he, aisa kahkar dakshin bhartiya hone kaa parichay diya he
 The remarkable fact in this matter is that the mantras of the Taittiriya Aranyaka, who are instructed in the Apastamb Dharmasutra, are derived from the Andhra text itself
 isi aadhaar par buhler aapstamb ko andhra–pradeshy maanate hai
 Hardatta has divided the two questions related to the Apastamba Dharmasutra into 11–11 tables and attempted Ujjavavlavathi Namni Tika

 Shankar has also written a commentary on two of the spiritual themes of the Apastamb Dharmasutra

 Apastamb Dharmasutra is unique from all Dharmasutras in terms of language and style
 bhashaa kii drushti se buhler ne is sutara kii bhashaa se sambandhit asangatiyon ko chaar virgon main rakhaa he
 Some obsolete words are found in the Apastamb Dharmasutra such as: in aprachlit or apanineey prayogon ke kaaran is sutara ke vishay main do dharanayen vidwaanon ke madhya main drushtigochar hoti hai– From the point of view of style, it can be said that most of the sutras in this sutra are in prose, but the use of verses is also often available in it
 isamen prapya sutara shithil tathaa aspasht hai tathaa inaki style brahmanon kii style ke samipatar prathit hoti he
 Regarding the time of the Apastamb Dharmasutra, Buehler's statement that it is appropriate to consider its time 150–200 years before Christ or even earlier, but Mahamahopadhyay Kane dated 700–300 BC
 The time between is considered

 janm sthaan ke bare main vidwaanon main matbhed he parantu adhiktar vidwaan inkaa janm kaashi main hi maanate hai, jisaki pushti swayan kabir kaa yah kathan bhi karata he
 The prevailing statement regarding Kabir's Guru is that Kabir was looking for a suitable Guru
 vah vaishnav sant acharya ramanand ko apana apana guru bananaa chaahate the lekin unhone kabir ko shishy banane se manaa kar diya lekin kabir ne apane man main thaan liya ki swami ramanand ko hi har keemat par apana guru banaaungaa ,iske liye kabir ke man main ek vichaar aayaa ki swami ramanand ji subah chaar baje ganga snaan karne jate hai uske pehle hi unke jane ke maarg main sidhiyon let jaaounga or unhone aisa hi kiya
 One day, Kabir fell on the stairs of the Panchganga Ghat as soon as one night
 ramanand ji gangasnan karne ke liye seedhiyaan utar rahe the ki tabhi unka pair kabir ke sharir par pad gaya
 The word 'ram-ram' immediately came out of his mouth
 usee ram ko kabir ne diksha-mantra maan liya or ramanand ji ko apana guru sweekaar kar liya
 In Kabir's own words- jivicoparjan ke liye kabir julahe kaa kaam karte the
 Kabir had a strong belief that one gets his end in accordance with his deeds and not because of particular place
 apni is manyata ko siddh karne ke liye ant samay main vah magahar chale gaye ;kyonki logon manyata thi ki kaashi main marane par swarg or magahar main marane par narak miltaa he
 He breathed his last in Maghar
 aaj bhi vahaan sthit majaar va samadhi sthit he
 The language of Kabir is Sadhukkari

 Kabir's Ram is not even a monotheistic, monotheistic God of Islam
 islam main khuda yaa allaah ko samast jagat evam jeevon se bhinn evam param samarth mana jaataa he
 But Ram of Kabir may be supremely capable, but he is never different from all beings and the world
 balki iske vipareet ve to sabamein vyaapt rahane vaale ramata ram hai
 He says that the universal Brahman Sabnimayi I, will worship the Pandit
 ravan-raav kawnasuun kavan veda ko rogi
 Kabir does not imagine any special design of Rama, because Rama would be bound in a particular structure as soon as he imagined the design, which was not acceptable to Kabir under any circumstances
 kabir ram kii avadharana ko ek bhinn or vyapak swaroop dena chaahate the
 There were some specific reasons for this, which we will discuss further in this article
 kintu iske baavjood kabir ram ke saath ek vyaktigat paariwarik kism kaa sambandh jarur sthapit karte hai
 His love for Rama is distinguished by his supernatural and glorious power without forgetting even a single moment on the surface of a spontaneous romantic human relationship
 kabir naam main vishwaas rakhte hai, rup main nahin
 Although it is commonly distinguished in the principles of devotion-sensation that 'the name is greater than the form', Kabir made this general principle a revolutionary use
 kabir ne ram-naam ke saath lokmanas main shatabdiyon se rache-based sanshlisht bhaavon ko udaatt evam vyapak swaroop dekar use puraana-pratipaadit brahmanvaadi vichaardhaara ke khaanche main baandhe jane se rokane kii koshish kii
 Kabir's Ram is beyond the distinction of nirgun-saguna
 darasal unhone apane ram ko shaastra-pratipaadit avtari, sagun, varchaswashil varnashram vyavastha ke sangrakshak ram se alag karne ke liye hi ‘nirgun ram’ shabd kaa prayog kiya–‘nirgun ram japahu re bhai
 There is no need to get confused about this 'nirguna' word
 kabir kaa aashay is shabd se sirf itnaa he ki ishwar ko kisi naam, rup, gun, kaal aadi kii simaaon main bandha nahin ja saktaa
 Those who are beyond all limits and still everywhere, are Nirgun Rama of Kabir
 ise unhone ‘ramata ram’ naam diya he
 Despite giving his Nirguna adjective to Rama, Kabir talks of a kind of human love affair with him
 kabhi vah ram ko maadhurya bhav se apana premi yaa pati maan lete hai to kabhi daasya bhav se swami
 Sometimes he considers Rama as the mother of Vatsalya idol and himself as his son
 nirgun-niraakaar brahm ke saath bhi is tarah kaa saras, sahaj, maanviya prem kabir kii bhakthi kii vilakshantaa he
 This dilemma and problem may occur to others that how Ram, with whom Kabir is so unique, human relational, can be good, but it is not a problem for Kabir himself
 vah kehete bhi hai “santau, dhokhaa kaasuun kahiye
 Gunam i nirgun, nirgunam gun, baat chaandi kya bahis! profesar mahavir saran jain ne kabir ke ram evam kabir kii sadhana ke sambandh main apane vichaar vyakt karte hue kaha he : " kabir kaa sara jivan satya kii khoj tathaa asaty ke khandan main vyateet hua
 Kabir's cultivation begins by knowing "not obeying"
 ve kisi ke shishy nahin, ramanand dwaara chetaye hue chela hai
 For him, Rama is not a form, Dasharathi is not Rama, his Rama is a symbol of spiritual practice
 unke ram kisi sampradaay, jati yaa desh kii simaaon main kaid nahin he
 In the particle of nature, even in Ramana in the limb, which one cannot touch, he is Alakh, the imperishable, the supreme element Rama
 unke ram manushya or manushya ke bich kisi bhed-bhav ke kaarak nahin hai
 They are the symbols of the element of love
 bhav se upar uthakar mahabhaav yaa prem ke aradhy hai - 'prem jagavai virah ko, virah jagavai piu, piu jagavai jeeva, joi piu soi jiu' - the one who is piu is the same creature
 isi kaaran unki puri sadhana ‘‘hans ubaaran aae kii sadhana he
 This goose cannot be revived by the reading of Pothis, and two and a half can be done only by the conduct of love
 dharm odhane kii cheez nahin he, jivan main aacharan karne kii satat satya sadhana he
 His practice begins with love
 itnaa gaharaa prem karo ki vahi tumhaare liye paramatma ho jaae
 There is so much eagerness to get it that one becomes the most reclusive, disrespectful, only then can that meditation be awakened in meditation
 vahi piu tumhaare arntman main baithe jeev ko jagaa saktaa he
 Joi Peiu is Soi Jiu
 tab tum puure sansar se prem karoge, tab sansar kaa prayek jeev tumhaare prem kaa paatr ban jayega
 All arrogance, all malice will go away
 phir mahabhaav jagega
 With this great spirit, the whole world becomes Piu's home
