 "mahavans" paanchavin shatabdi i pus se chauthi shatabdi i tak lagbhag saadhe aath sau varshon kaa lekha he
 It included the arrival of Lanka thrice of the Tathagata, of the three Buddhist musicians, of conquering Lanka, of the arrival of Ashokaputra Mahendra to Lanka during the reign of Devanampari Tishya, of monks visiting Buddhism in countries other than Magadha and the branch of the Bodhi tree
 Including Mahendra Sthavir's sister Ashokputri Sanghamitra's description of coming to Lanka

 The thirty-seventh passage is incomplete
 jis rachayita ne mahavans ko aage jari rakhaa usne isi pariched main 198 gaathaayen or jodakar is pariched ko "saat raja" sheershak diya
 Every subsequent historian did not end the history of his part at any passage, but even the next passage, some of the gathas seem to have been written with the intention that this tradition of preserving ethnic history should remain intact

 In 1939, after Germany incited World War, Hitler began to implement his final solution to eradicate the Jews
 uske sainik yahudiyon ko kuch khaas ilaakon main thunsane lage
 Special camps were set up to get them working, to gather and kill them at one place, the most notorious being Auschwitz
 yahudiyon ko in shiviron main laayaa jaataa or vahaan band kamaron main jahrili gas chhodkar unhen maar daalaa jaataa
 Those who are not considered capable of working would be put to death, while most of the remaining Jews died of hunger and disease
 yuddh ke baad saamne aae dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki hitler kaa makasad duniya se ek-ek yahudee ko khatm kar dena tha
 During the six years of the war, the Nazis killed about six million Jews, including 1
5 million children
 yahudiyon ko jad se mitaane ke apane makasad ko hitler ne itane prabhavi dhang se anjaam diya ki duniya kii ek tihaai yahudee aabaadi khatm ho gai
 This massacre was unique in terms of number, management and execution

 is sawaal ke kai jawaab pesh kiye jate rahe hai : dharmik, aitihaasik, darshanik, manovaigyanik or marxvaadi
 But no one answer can ever be satisfactory
 aitihaasik jawaab kuch is tarah he- 1930 ke dashak main german jansankhya ke ek bade hisse ne ek aise samaaj main rahane kii rajamandi jataai, jo nafrat, jaateey shreshthata kii avadharana or hinsa par aadhaarit thi
 The central belief of the system they were tied to was that the Jewish people represent everything that is against the Germans and therefore the Jews should be exterminated
 yah dharna duniya ko dekhne ke ek nasli nazariye se bhi judi thi, jo germanon ko master res kaa hissaa maanati thi or yahudiyon ko vinaashkari bhautik gunon vaale anti res kaa
 When the geographical elimination of the Jews could not be possible, then they took the most radical route, which was the final solution
 itihaas main is tarah kii or bhi ghatnaayen milti hai, lekin holocost kii kuch baaten use vilakshan banaati hai
 Apart from Nazi Germany, many governments have resorted to camp systems and technology, and Jews have been murdered for much of history
 lekin do mukhya vajahon se holocost ko sabase alag kaha ja saktaa he
 1
 Apart from their policies towards other groups, the Nazis undertook to kill every Jew
 iske liye unhone umr, ling, aasthaa yaa kaam kii parvaah nahin kii
 He especially used a modern bureaucracy to accomplish this objective

 However, there was no real threat from the Jews

 Global warming means the increase in the mean temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and ocean temperatures since the 20th century and its approximate continuity

 The inter-government panel sitting on climate change concludes that "the increase in the world's average temperature since the middle of the 20th century is primarily due to man-made greenhouse gases
" jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he, dharti ke vaataavaran ke taapmaana main lagaataar ho rahi vishwavyaapee badhotaree ko 'global varming' kaha ja rahaa he
 Our earth receives heat from the sun's rays
 ye kirane vayumandal se guzarati huin dharti kii sataha se takaraati hai or phir vahiin se paravartit hokar pun: laut jaati hai
 The Earth's atmosphere is made up of several gases, including some greenhouse gases
 inamen se adhikansh dharti ke upar ek prakaar se ek prakritik aavaran bana leti hai jo lautati kirnon ke ek hisse ko roak letaa he or is prakaar dharti ke vaataavaran ko garm banaae rakhata he
 It is worth noting that at least 16 degree Celsius temperature is necessary for humans, creatures and plants to survive
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki greenhouse gaison main badhotaree hone par yah aavaran or bhi saghan yaa motaa hota jaataa he
 In such a situation, this cover starts to prevent more rays of the sun and then from here the effects of global warming begin
 ipisisi dwaara diye gayi jalwaayu parivartan ke model ingit karte hai ki dharaatal kaa ausat global taapmaana 21veen shatabdi ke dauraan or adhik bad saktaa he
 This rise in the temperature of the whole world can cause sea level rise, rise in extreme weather and significant changes in the amount and composition of rainfall
 global varming ke anya prabhaavon main krishi upaj main parivartan, vyapaar margon main sanshodhan, glacier kaa peeche hatana, prajatiyon ke vilupt hone kaa khatra aadi shaamil hai
 "global warming" refers to the warming in recent decades and its persistence, and its indirect effects on humans
 jalwaayu parivartan par sanyukt raashtra samjhaute kii ruparekha main "maanav dwaara kiye gaye parivartanon ke liye "jalwaayu parivartan or anya parivartano ke liye "jalwaayu parivartanshiltaa" shabd kaa istemaal kiya he
 The term "climate change" assumes that rising temperatures are not the only effect
 The term "anthropogenic global warming" is used many times when the focus is on human-induced change

 aam sahmati ke vichaar se alag kuch anya sankalpanaaon kaa suzav adhikansh taapmaana vruddhi kii vyakhya karne ke liye diya jaataa he
 One such hypothesis proposes that heat can be a result of solar activity in different forms
 baadhyataa kaa koi bhi prabhaav taatkaalik nahin he
 The heat inertia of the Earth's oceans and the slow response to many indirect effects mean the Earth's current temperature is not in equilibrium with the pressure exerted on it
 Studies of climate commitment show that if greenhouse gases are stabilized at 2000 levels So to some extent even beyond this
 garmi dikhaai degi The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fournier and was first quantitatively investigated in 1896 by Scenti Arness
 yah prakriya dwaara jo avasorana or utsarjan ke avarakt vikiran dwaara vaataavaran main garm gaisen vaataavaran main ek or grah kii sataha kam he
 Existence as a Greenhouse effect is thus not disputed
 swaabhaavik rup se green house gaison ke paas hone kaa matlab he ek garmi ke prabhaav ke bare main 33 degree celsius, jo prithvi par rahane yogya nahin honge
 
 Important greenhouse gases on the earth are water vapor, which produces a greenhouse effect of 36–70 percent); carbon dioxide that produces up to 9–26 percent greenhouse effect; methane up to 4-9 percent and ozone, which produces up to 3-7 percent effect
 The issue is how the power of the greenhouse effect changes when atmospheric concentrations of certain greenhouse gases increase from human activity
 audyogic kranti ke baad se maanvi gatividhi main vruddhi hui he jiske kaaran green house gaison ki maatra main bahut jiyaada vruddhi hui he, iske kaaran vikaranshil baadhya CO se2, methane, tropospheric ozon, siefasi or s nitrous bhi bahut bad gaye hai Iagara anu ki drushti se dekhen to methane greenhouse gasccharbon dioxide kii tulana main adhik prabhavi he, par uski sandratha itani kam he ki uskaa vikaranshil jor carbon dioxide ki tulana main keval ek chauthai he praaqatik rup se utpann hone vaali kuch duusari gaise greenhouse prabhaav main yogadan detii hai
 One of these nitrous oxide is developing due to human activities like agriculture! Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 have increased by 31% and 149% respectively since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700th century
 pichley 650,000 varshon ke dauraan kisi bhi samay se in staron ko kaaphi adhik mana ja rahaa he
 This is the period for which the reliable figures are ice cores
 Are derived from
 kam pratyaksh bhuvaigyanik pramaan se yah mana jaataa he ki CO2 kii itani zyada maatra pichhali baar 20 karod varsh pehle hui thi
 Burning of fossil fuels has increased at least one-third of the increase in CO2 from human activities in the last 20 years
 shesh kaary bhoomi ke upyog main parivartan ke kaaran se hota he visheshkar wanon kii kataai se aisa hota he
 Current vaso-atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are approximately 385 per million ppm) by volume

 There are sufficient reserves of fossil fuels to reach this level and to continue emissions even after 2100 if coal, sand sand or methane claretrate are widely used
 jalwaayu par baadhk ghatakon ke prabhaav vibhinn prakriyaaon dwaara jatil ho jate hai
 One of the most obvious responses relates to water evaporation
 carbon daai oxide jaisi dirghakaalin greenhouse prabhaav vaali gaison ke milane se paidaa hone vaali garmi vayumandal main jal ke adhik maatra main vashpikaran kaa kaaran banataa he
 Because water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, it makes the atmosphere even hotter and it changes more water vapor into B) and this reaction continues until the recycling cycle is stopped
 Its effect from oxide will be huge
 yadhyapi pratyuttar kii yah prakriya vaayu kii nami ke kanon main badhotari karti he, tab bhi saapeksh ardrata yaa to sthir rahati he yaa thodi si ghat jaati he kyonki vaayu garm ho jaati he
 This effect of response can only be reversed slowly as carbon dioxide has a longer atmospheric lifespan
 badalon se prabhavit hone vaale pratyuttar ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 Seen from below, the cloud emits infrared radiation back to the surface and exerts a heat effect, seen from above, the clouds and sunlight emit space to reflect infrared radiation and therefore exert a cooling effect

 Both the theory and the model indicate that warming will reduce the temperature drop with altitude, creating a negative lapse rate feedback and weakening the greenhouse effect

 Another important process is the ice 'albedo response when the global temperature increases, then the ice near the poles starts melting at a faster rate
 jaise jaise barf pighalati he vaise vaise bhoomi athwa khulaa jal uskaa sthsthaan le letaa he
 Both land and water are less reflective than ice and therefore absorb more amount of solar radiation

 Positive reorientation that occurs due to the emission of CO2 and CH4 is another reason that increases warming
 yah gaisen jamate hue permphrost jaise kii jamaa hui lakdi, siberia main daldal se paidaa hoti hai
 Likewise, methane clathrate, which is found in the oceans, emits enormous amounts of CH4, can be a major cause of warming, as the clathrate gun hypothesis states
 jaise jaise samudr garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise carbon ko alag karne kii kshamta ghatati jaati he
 This is because the declining levels of nutrients in the mesopelagic region are impeding the development of diatoms and favor small phytoplankton that are biological pumps of carbon

 Duke University ke do shodhakartaaon, Bruce West or Nicola Scafetta ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki surya ne 1900-2000 tak shaayad 45-50 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaane main yogadan diya he or 1980 or 2000 ke bich main lagbhag 25-35 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaaya he
 Climate models have been found by Peter Scott and other researchers to overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases and do not give much importance to solar forcing, suggesting that volcanic dust and sulfate aerosols are also underestimated
 Despite solar forcing, much of the warming is likely to be caused by greenhouse gases, especially from the mid-20th century

 According to the instrumental temperature record, the temperature of the Earth, whether on land or at sea, has increased from 1860–1900
 This increase in temperature is not affected by the urban heat island effect
 From 1079, the temperature of the land is almost double than the sea temperature
 The temperature in the lower troposphere is between 0

 Hindu is not only a religion or a community but a way of life

 Modern historians consider the history of this religion to be a few thousand years old, based on archaeological investigations such as Harappa, Mehrgarh
 jahaan bharat kii sindhu ghati sabhyataa main hindu dharm ke kai chihn milte hai
 Statues of an unknown mother goddess, postures of deity like Lord Shiva Pashupati, Shivling, worship of Peepal, etc
 are prominent
 itihaaskaaron ke ek drushtikon ke anusaar is sabhyataa ke ant ke dauraan madhya asia se ek anya jati kaa aagaman hua, jo swayan ko arya kehete the or sanskrit naam kii ek hind europea bhashaa bolte the
 According to another view, the people of Indus Valley Civilization were Aryans themselves and their original place was India
 aaryon kii sabhyataa ko vaidic sabhyataa kehete hai
 According to the first view, the Aryans settled in Afghanistan, Kashmir, Punjab and Haryana in around 1700 BC
 tabhi se wo log apane devataaon ko prasann karne ke liye vaidic sanskrit main mantra rachane lage
 The first four Vedas were composed, of which Rigveda was the first
 uske baad upanishad jaise granth aae
 According to Hindu belief, the Vedas, Upanishads etc
 are eternal, eternal, by the grace of God, the different sages received knowledge of different texts, who then scripted them
 buddha or dharmon ke alag ho jane ke baad vaidic dharm main kaafii parivartan aayaa
 New gods and new philosophies emerged
 is tarah aadhunik hindu dharm kaa janm hua
 According to another view, Hinduism probably has its origins in the Indian tradition even before the Indus Saraswati tradition
 bharatvarsh ko pracheen rishiyon ne "hindusthan" naam diya tha, jiskaa apbhransh "hindustan" he
 According to "jupiter Agam": "hindu" shabd "sindhu" se bana mana jaataa he
 The word Sindhu in Sanskrit has two main meanings - first, the Indus river which rises near Mansarovar and joins the sea flowing from Ladakh and Pakistan, the second - a sea or water body
 rugveda kii nadistuti ke anusaar ve saat nadiyaan thim : sindhu, saraswati, vitasta, shutudri, vipasha, parushini or askini 
 According to another view, the first letter of the Himalayas, "hi" and the last letter "indu" of Indu, these two letters formed the word "hindu" and this land was called Hindusthan
 hindu shabd us samay dharm ke bajaay rashtriyata ke rup main prayukt hota tha
 Since at that time there were only people who believed in Vedic religion in India, but no other religion had emerged till then, so the word "hindu" was used for all Indians
 bharat main keval vaidic dharmavalambiyon ke basane ke kaaran kaalaantar main videshiyon ne is shabd ko dharm ke sandarbh main prayog karnaa shuru kar diya
 Generally, the word Hindu is considered by many analysts to be a term given by foreigners
 is dharna ke anusaar hindu ek farsi shabd he
 Hinduism is also called Sanatana Dharma or Vedic Sanatana Varnashrama Dharma
 rugveda main sapt sindhu kaa ullekh miltaa he - wo bhoomi jahaan arya sabase pehle based the
 According to linguists, the "S" sound of the Hindu Aryan languages is converted to the "H" sound of the Iranian languages
 isliye sapt sindhu avestan bhashaa main jaakar haft hindu main parivartit ho gaya 
 After this, the Iranians gave the name of Hindus to those living east of the Indus River
 jab arab se muslim hamalavar bharat main aae, to unhone bharat ke mul dharmavalambiyon ko hindu kahana shuru kar diya
 In the four Vedas, in the Puranas, in the Mahabharata, in the memories, this religion is not called Hinduism, it is called Vedic Sanatana Varnashrama Dharma
 hindu dharm main koi ek akele siddhanton kaa samooh nahin he jise sabhi hinduon ko maananaa zaruri he
 This is a way of life more than religion
 hinduon kaa koi kendriya carch yaa dharmsanghathan nahin he or na hi koi "pope"
 Many beliefs and sects come under it and equal reverence is given to all
 dharmagranth bhi kai hai
 Nevertheless, the main principles, which most Hindus believe, believe in all these: religion, karma, worldly cycle of rebirth, salvation and of course, God
 hindu dharm swarg or narak ko asthaayee maanata he
 According to Hinduism, all beings in the world have a soul
 manushya hi aisa praani he jo is lok main paap or punya, dono karm bhoga saktaa he or moksh praapt kar saktaa he
 There are four main sects in Hinduism: Vaishnavism, Shaiva, Shakta and Smarta
 lekin zyaadaatar hindu swayan ko kisi bhi sampradaay main vargeekrut nahin karte hai
 In ancient times and medieval times, Shaiva, Shakta and Vaishnava used to fight among themselves
 jinhen madhyakaal ke santon ne samanvit karne kii safal koshish kii or sabhi sampradaayon ko paraspar ashrith bataaya
 In short, the main elements of Hinduism are the following: Hinduism - Hinduism - who? - Goshu Bhaktibhavedyasya Pranave ch steadha matih
 punarjanmani vishwaasah sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath-- gomata main jisaki bhakthi ho, pranav jiskaa poojya mantra ho, punarjanm main jiskaa vishwaas ho--vahi hindu he
 According to Merutantra episode 33, 'hinam Dushyati sa Hindu' means one who considers Hin to be corrupt
 lokmaanya tilak ke anusaar- asindhoh sindhuparyanta yasya bharatbhumika
 Pitrubhā: Punyabhश्चश्चāva सa वैa वैa Hinduुरritti Smrita
 
 That is, from the point of origin of the Indus River to the Indus, the entire land of India, which has ancestral and virtuous land, is called Hindu
 hindu shabd multah farsi he iskaa arth un bharatiyon se he jo bharatvarsh ke pracheen granthon, vedon, puraanon main varnit bharatvarsh kii seemaa ke mul evam paidaayasi pracheen nivasee hai
 According to the basic foundations of the current Hindu law based on Kalika Purana, Medni Kosh, etc
, Varnaashram is a Hindu who believes in Vedic religion in the form of Vedashram
 yadhyapi kuch log kai samskruti ke mishrit rup ko hi bhartiya samskruti maanate he, jabaki aisa nahin he
 The culture or religion which has not originated and developed on the land of India, how can that religion or culture be Indian
 hindu dharm ke siddhanth ke kuch mukhya bindu: According to Hindu scripture Upanishads, Brahma is the ultimate element
 wo hi jagat kaa saar he, jagat kii aatma he
 He is the basis of the world
 usee se vishwa kii utpatti hoti he or vishwa nasht hone par usee main villin ho jaataa he
 Brahm is one and only one
 wo vishwathit bhi he or vishwa ke pare bhi
 He is the ultimate truth, omnipotent and omniscient
 wo kalathit, nity or shaashvat he
 That is the ultimate knowledge
 brahm ke do rup hai : parabrahm or aparabrahm
 Parbrahma is infinite, eternal and devoid of body
 wo sabhi gunon se bhi pare he, par usamen anant satya, anant chit or anant anand he
 Brahma is not worshiped , because it is beyond worship and indescribable
 uskaa dhyaan kiya jaataa he
 Pranava is the 8 Brahmavakya, which all Hindus consider to be the ultimate holy word
 hindu yah maanate hai ki om kii dhwani puure brahmand main gunj rahi he
 It is heard when deep into meditation
 brahm kii pariklpana veydant darshan kaa kendriya stambh he or hindu dharm kii vishwa ko anupam dein he
 What is the relation between Brahma and God, the thinking of Hindu philosophy is different
 advait veydant ke anusaar jab maanav brahm ko apane man se jaanane kii koshish karata he, tab brahm ishwar ho jaataa he, kyonki maanav maaya naam kii ek jaadui shakti ke vash main rahata he
 That is, when the shadow of Brahma falls in the mirror of Maya, then the image of Brahma is shown to us as God
 ishwar apni isi jaadui shakti "maaya" se vishwa kii sristi karata he or us par shashan karata he
 Although God is with a negative force in this situation, Maya is not able to impress him, just as a magician is not surprised by his own magic
 maaya ishwar kii daasi he, parantu ham jeevon kii swamini he
 Although God is formless, but because of Maya, he can appear to us as many gods
 iske vipareet vaishnav maton or darshanon main mana jaataa he ki ishwar or brahm main koi fark nahin he--or vishnu hi ishwar hai
 According to the Nyaya, Vaishika and Yoga philosophies, God is the supreme and supreme soul, who is enlightened and is the creator and ruler of the world
 jo bhi ho, baaki baaten sabhi hindu maanate hai : ishwar ek or keval ek he
 It is both universal and reliable
 beshak, ishwar sagun he
 He is self-centered and the cause of the world
 wo puja or upasna kaa vishay he
 He is complete, eternal, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent
 wo raag-dwesh se pare he, par apane bhakton se prem karata he or unpar krupa karata he
 Without his will, not even a single leaf can move in this world
 wo vishwa kii naitik vyavastha ko kaayam rakhata he or jeevon ko unke karmon ke anusaar sukh-dukh pradaan karata he
 According to Srimad Bhagavadgita, he comes from time to time in the form of an avatar on the earth after a moral collapse in the world
 ishwar ke anya naam hai : parameshwar, paramatma, vidhaataa, bhagwaan 
 This god is called Musalman Allah, God, Christian God and Jews Yahweh
 hindu dharm main kai devtaa hai, jinako angrezi main galat rup se "gods" kaha jaataa he
 There can be three opinions about who these deities are: ek baat or kahi ja sakati he ki zyaadaatar vaishnav or shaiva darshan pehle do vichaaron ko sammilit rup se maanate hai
 For example, Krishna is considered to be the God under whom all other gods and goddesses are present and at the same time, all the gods and goddesses are considered to be the form of Krishna
 tisare mat ko dharmagranth manyata nahin dete
 Whatever be the thinking, these deities are integral to the colorful Hindu culture
 vaidic kaal ke mukhya dev the-- indra, agni, som, varun, rudra, vishnu, prajapati, savita or deviyaan-- saraswati, usha, prithvi, ityadi
