 According to The Guardian and The New York Times, he has spoken of redistribution of wealth and is associated with socialists and communists who are willing to redistribute wealth
 lekin di gargian ne yah bhi khabar di he ki zuma ne "videshi niveshkon ke hiton kii raksha karne kaa aashwaasan" diya he
 Zuma also got involved in a corruption-related controversy after his financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, was accused of corruption and fraud
 us samay lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshak rahe bulilani ngakuka zuma or ANC mukhya sachetak tony yengeni ke khilaaf takat kaa durupyog karne ke iljaamon kii jaanch kar rahe the
 In 2004, Zuma became a prominent figure in the Schabir Shaik trial
 schabir shaike ek durban vyapaaree or zuma ke vittiya salaahkaar the, dakshin africa nausena ke durban main ek prastaavit waterfrant vikaas ke liye vailar varg ladaai ke jahaajon kii kharid main rishwatakhori or nakandla main zuma ke bhavy nivas par kiye gaye kharch ke sandarbh main unase sawaal kiya gaya
 During the trial, Shack was shown requesting a bribe of 500 000 rand per year for Zuma in support of Zuma's defense contractor Thomson CSF, which is recorded in the infamous "encrypted fax"
 2 june 2005 ko, shaike ko doshi paaya gaya or 15 saal kii sajaa sunai gai
 Judge Hillary Squires gives a detailed account of several transactions between Shack and Zuma, with a summary that "all the accused companies have been used to pay Jacob Zuma at one time"
 The media incorrectly quoted Squires' statement with the phrase "a generally corrupt relationship", while the exact same word does not exist in court transcripts
 is vaakyansh kii shuruyaat karne waalon kii pratiraksha main, shaike ke khilaaf faisle ke sampoorn pratilekh main vastav main zuma kaa zikr 471 baar hua he, "bhrasht" yaa "bhrashtachar" shabd kaa prayog 54 baar kiya gaya he or isamen aise 12 vaakya hai jinamein "bhrasht" or "zuma" donon shabdon kaa prayog ek saath he
 Later media sources changed the phrase to "mutually beneficial symbiosis", which was replaced by Article 235 of the verdict, which was: "to think it would be against common sense and ordinary human nature to benefit from the accusations of Zuma
" Was not realized, which was getting far more than before 1997; and even if nothing was ever said between them that could help mutually beneficial symbiosis Is installed, which can generate a sense of in only thanks to a series of continuing in accordance with the evidence was there, its conditions to start and these payments after the recipient
 " On June 14, 2005, President Thabo Mbeki removed Zuma from the post of vice-president, after media speculated about his future with deep speculation
 mabek ne sansad kii sanyukt baithak main kaha ki "yah mananeey up raashtrapati, sarkaar, hamaari yuva loktantric pranali or hamaare desh ke hit main sabase acha hoga ki mananeey jacob zuma ko unke prajatantr ke up raashtrapati or cabinet ke sadsy ke pad kii jimmedaariyon se mukt kar diya jaae
" tab zuma ne sansad ke sadsy ke pad se istipha de diya
 Following the Shack trial, Zuma was formally accused of corruption by the National Prosecuting Authority
 sthagan ke liye abhiyojan paksh dwaara daayar aavedan ke khaarij ho jane ke baad maamle ko petermarittsburg hai court se waapas le liye gaya
 Zuma's legal team continued to delay the action and despite Zuma's assertion that he wished to look into the matter in court, he managed to conceal some important evidence from the court that resulted in the prosecution's adjournment on the due date Had to file an application for 8 navambar 2007 ko supreme court of apil ne rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran ke paksh main apana nirnay sunaaya jo zuma ke raksha dal dwaara kiye hue vibhinn khoj or jabti sambandhi kaaryon ke sambandh main tha or unke dwaara kiye gaye chaar apilon ko kaarij kar diya gaya
 The decision was in relation to obtaining a personal diary of a senior member of a French arms company by the National Prosecuting Authority, which provided information related to Zuma's corrupt practices, possibly while awarding an arms deal
 28 disambar 2007 ko, scorpian ne zuma par ucch nyaayalay main thag-vyapaar, kaale dhan ko vaid karne, bhrashtachar or dhokhadhadi ke vibhinn maamalon main abhiyog chalaaya
 a conviction and imprisonment of more than 1 year would have made Zuma ineligible for election to the South African Parliament and consequently he would have been disqualified for the presidency of South Africa
 4 agast 2008 ko zuma adaalat main haazir hue
 12 sitambar 2008 ko petermarittsburg nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke bataaya ki zuma par lage bhrashtachar ke aarope prakriyaatmak aadhaar par avaidh hai kyonki lok abhiyojan ke rashtriya nideshaalay ne aarope lagane kaa nirnay lene se pehle zuma ko abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka nahi diya or rajya ko kanoonee bhugtan karne ke nirdesh die
 Nikholson also stated that, he believed that political interference played a role in the decision to file charges again against Zuma, although he did not explain why he dismissed the allegations against Zuma as invalid
 nikholson ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki unka nirnay zuma ke aparaadh yaa nirparaadh se sambandhit nahin tha, balki yah keval ek prakriyaatmak aadhaar par tha
 Various media reports have misinformed that the charges against Zuma have been dismissed
 maamla yah nahin tha
 The NDPP was able to re-accuse Zuma, however, only once he was given the opportunity to present a representation to the NDPP, based on the ndpp's decision to do so
 In paragraph 47 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson wrote, abhyavedan ko sunne kii baadhyataa audi alterum partem ke siddhant kaa ek hissaa he
 The requirement is that a person who may be adversely affected by a decision may be given an opportunity to make a representation with a view to achieving a favorable outcome
 The affected person should usually be informed of the essence or elements of the case to which he or she has to respond
 adaalat ne yah nirdhaarit kiya ki NDPP ke samvidhan kii dhara 179 main ullikhit prakriya kaa paalan kar paane kii vifaltaa ne NDPP dwaara zuma par punah aarope lagane ke nirnay ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 Judge Nicholson found that various estimates could be made at the time of the allegations leveled against Zuma which corroborated the conclusion that it contained some degree of political interference by the executive branch of the government
 nyaayadhish nikholson apane nirnay ke para 210 main likhte hai, After the President's political defeat in Polokwane, the timing of the indictment by Mr Emsche on 28 December 2007 was the most unfortunate

 In Article 220 of the judgment, Judge Nicholson further wrote, raajnneetik hastkshep, dabaav yaa prabhaav ke sanketon se upar uth kar jo vyavhaar maine nirdhaarit kiye hai unamem ek chintajanak dhaancha he
 It began with the "political leadership" given by Minister Maduna to Mr
 Ngcuka when he refused to prosecute the applicant, whose crime was to talk to and meet with Thint representatives and other matters that i have referred to
 Given the rule of evidence, the court is bound to accept the conclusion that is least suited to the interest of the party who has special knowledge of the facts
 yah nishchit rup se yengeni maamle main ullikhit "suraag yaa suzav" ke raajnneetik hastkshep se adhik prabal he
 It is a matter of grave concern that such a process took place in New South Africa and prompted destruction under apartheid regime
 " The South African judiciary was severely criticized by Zuma's supporters before the hearing

 The NDPP soon announced its intention to appeal against this decision
 thabo mabek ne petermarittsburg ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish kris nikholson ke nirnay par apil karne ke liye sanvaidhanik nyaayalay main ek halafanama daayar kiya: It was unfair for the court to come to such far-reaching "vexatious, scandalous and unfavorable" conclusions related to me, and to judge and condemn those conclusions based on the Zuma case

 yah vichaaradhin he
 " 12 janvari 2009 ko blomphontain ke supreme court of apil main is apil ke liye nirnay ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 Deputy Judge President Louis Harms had to decide on two aspects of the appeal
 The first aspect was whether Zuma had the right to be invited to make representations to the NPA before he decided to withdraw the bribery and corruption charges against him
 The second aspect was whether Judge Nicholson was correct in understanding the political interference given by then President Thabo Mbeki in the context of the npa's decision to impose charges on Zuma

 On the question of Nikholson's argument given by Mbeki about political interference, Harms DP found that "the lower court has violated its rights"

 The revelations were in the form of pieces of phone talk showing that Scorpion's president, Leonard mccarthy, and former National Director of Public Prosecutions, Bulleani Ngcuka, had conspired with Zuma about the timing of the prosecution, presumably Zuma's political The opponent was for the political benefit of President Thabo Mbeki

 Soon after the announcement of the NPA, however, at least two political parties reported that they would consider legal action on their own if the charges were dropped

 While Zuma filed his response tentatively, Ampshe delayed the hearing of the case, requesting two extensions to present the npa's response

 District, the Democratic Alliance party chief, argued that Zuma's response was fundamentally wrong and "they have no constitutional basis"
 While legal challenges continued, a June 2009 poll showed that more than half of South Africans believe that President Jacob Zuma is doing a good job

 Despite the defection of some former supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to protest outside the court, relentlessly rebuking the integrity and morality of the prosecutor, abusing a close friend of the accuser and throwing stones at another woman as the prosecutor The acts sparked criticism from anti-rape groups
 zuma ke pratirakshak dal ne peedit mahila ke yon ateet se sambandhit saboot pesh kiye or jor dekar kaha ki yah shaareerik sambandh donon kii sahamati se hua
 The prosecution insisted that the woman's lack of resistance was due to her being in a state of shock and that the relationship between the two was similar to the father-daughter relationship

 However, these analysts also questioned whether Zuma was indeed a leftist candidate as many of his supporters understand and pointed out that the global and national economic barriers that prevailed during Mbeki's rule were also in the next presidential term

 bhai ji bahuaiami vyaktitv ke swami the
 While he was an exclusive preacher of Aryasamaj and Vedic religion, he also earned a reputation as a historian, litterateur and educationist
 sardaar bhagat singh, sukhdev, pan ram prasad 'bismil', kartaar singh saraaba jaise asankhya rashtrabhakt yuvak unase prerana praapt kar bali-path ke raahi bane the
 Bhai ji's name as a patriotism, political firm and independent thinker will always be remembered
 aapane kathin tathaa sankatpurna sthitiyon kaa datakar saamana kiya or kabhi vichlit nahin hue
 You have written the history of India in Hindi
 itihaas-lekhan main aap raajaaon, yudhon tathaa mahapurushon ke jeevanavritton ko hi pradhanta dene ke paksh main na the
 Your clear opinion was that in caste, feelings, desires, aspirations, culture and civilization should also be given importance
 aapane apane jivan ke sansmaran bhi likhe hai jo yuvakon ke liye aaj bhi prerana dene main sakasham hai
 Bhai ji was born on 4 November 1876 in a Brahmin family of Kariyala village in district Jhelum
 inke pitaaji kaa naam bhai tarachandra tha
 Matidas, brother of this holy family, accepted the challenge of Aurangzeb by reaching Delhi with Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji to protect Hinduism
 san 1902 main bhai parmanand ne punjab vishvavidhyalay se snatakottar kii oopaadhi praapt kii or lahore ke dayanand anglo mahavidhyalay main shikshak niyukt hue
 Seeing your interest in India's ancient culture and Vedic religion, Mahatma Hansraj sent you to Africa in October, 1905 to propagate Indian culture
 darban main bhai ji kii gandhiji se bhent hui
 In Africa, you came in contact with the then prominent revolutionaries Sardar Ajit Singh, Sufi Ambaprasad etc

 Brother came in contact with both of them
 bhai ji san 1907 main bharat laut aaye
 Along with teaching in Dayanand Vedic College, he was active in motivating the youth for revolution
 sardaar ajit singh tathaa lala lajpat raay se unka nikat kaa sampark tha
 During this time the Lahore Police followed him
 san 1910 main bhai ji ko lahore main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 But he was soon released on bail
 iske baad bhai ji america chale gayi
 There he propagated the Vedic religion among the diaspora
 vahaan martanak upnivesh main aapaki prakhyat krantikari lala hardayal se bhent hui
 a team of prominent activists was being organized here to bring revolution in India
 lala hardayal kii prerana se aap bhi is dal main sammilit ho gaye
 Kartar Singh Saraba, Vishnu Ganesh Pingale and other youths pledged to dedicate their lives to the independence of India under his inspiration
 1913 main bharat lautakar bhai ji pun: lahore main yuvakon ko kranti kii prerana dene ke kaary main sakriy ho gayi
 Bhai Parmanand visited several British colonies of South America and met Lala Hardayal again in San Francisco
 gadar party ke sansthaapakon main ve bhi shaamil the
 In 1914, he went to Portland with Lala Hardayal for a lecture tour and wrote a book titled 'tavarikhe-hind' for the Gadar Party
 bhai ji dwaara likhi pustak "tawarikhe-hind" tathaa unke lekh yuvakon ko sashastr kranti ke liye prerit karte the
 He returned to India with the aim of revolutionizing India
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki unke saath paanch hajaar krantikari bharat aaye the
 He was also among the leaders of the Gadar revolution
 unako peshawar main kranti kaa netritv karne kaa jimmaa diya gaya tha
 On 25 February 1915, Bhai ji was arrested in Lahore along with other members of the Ghadar Party
 unke viruddh america tathaa england main angreji satta ke viruddh shadyantr rachane, kartaar singh saraaba tathaa anya anek yuvakon ko sashastr kranti ke liye prerit karne, aapattijanak sahitya kii rachana karne jaise aarope lagaakar phaansi kii sajaa suna di gayi
 As soon as the news of the punishment was received, people from all over the country were agitated
 antat: bhai ji kii phaansi kii sajaa radd kar unhen aaajeevan karawas kaa dand dekar disambar, 1915 main andaman bhej diya gaya
 On the other hand, Bhai Ji was enduring inhuman torture in jail, in spite of his wife Mrs
 Bhagyasudhi's affection, she was caring for her family with full self-respect and courage
 andaman kii kaal kothri main bhai ji ko gita ke upadeshon ne sadaiv karmath banaae rakhaa
 On the basis of the excerpts written in Srimad Bhagavad Gita, he later composed a book titled "my last time of shelter"
 rajnatik bandiyon ko kathor karawas ke viruddh bhai ji ne do maheene kaa bhukh hadtaal kiya
 When Gandhiji received the news of his inhuman torture in Kalapani, he harshly condemned the torture by writing an article in "young India" of 19 November 1919
 unhone bhai ji kii rihaai kii bhi maang kii
 On 20 April 1920, Bhai ji was freed from Kalapani jail
 kalepani kii kalkothri main paanch varshon main bhai ji ne jo amanviya yatnaayen sahan kin, bhai ji dwaara likhit "meri aapbeetee" pustak main unka varnan padhakar rongte khadey ho jate hai
 a thrilling description of these tortures is also given in the "revolutionary Bhai Parmanand" text written by Prof
 Dharamvir
 jail se mukt hokar bhai ji ne pun: lahore ko apana kaary kshetra banaaya
 Lala Lajpat Rai was one of Bhai's unique friends
 unhone rashtriya viapeeth kii sthapana kii to uskaa kaarybhaar bhai ji ko saunpa gaya
 Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev etc

 Bhai Ji wrote the book "veer Banda Vairagi", which became popular in the whole country
 congress tathaa gandhi ji ne jab muslim tushtikaran kii ghaatak niti apanaai to bhai ji ne uskaa kadaa virodh kiya
 That is why they stayed away from Congress movements
 ve jagah-jagah hindu sanghathan ke mahatv par bal dete the
 Bhai Ji exposed the conspiracies to divide the country by publishing the letter "hindu"
 bhai ji ne san 1930 main hi yah bhavishyavaanee kar di thi ki muslim netaaon kaa antim uddeshy mathrubhumi kaa vibhaajan kar pakistan kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 Bhai ji also warned that do not trust Congress leaders, they will betray the country someday

 Batteries that can be re-charged and re-energized are called rechargeable batteries
 inhen dwitiyak cell bhi kehete hai
 The electrochemical reactions occurring in them are electrically reversible
 punarbharaneey batariyaan vibhinn aakaar-prakaar kii hotin he - batan cell se lekar megawatt shakti pradaan karne vaali pranaliyaan While charging the cell, its positive active substance oxidizes and gives electrons
 isi samay cell kaa rinatmak sakriy padaarth apachayit hokar electranon ko grahan karata he
 These electrons make the current flow in the external circuit
 vidyut apghaty ek saadhaaran madhyam kaa kaary kar saktaa he jisase hokar ek electrode se duusare electrode tak aayan aasaani se gati kar saken ; athwa vidyut-apghaty cell ke andar hone vaali vidyutrasinic kriya main sakriy bhaag bhi le saktaa he The accumulator battery is a device in which chemical energy is stored, which can be released at any time in the form of electricity
 saamaanya upyog main aanevaali sanchayak batariyaan do prakaar kii hoti hai : Lead-acid batteries were invented in 1859 by French physicist Gaston Plante
 yah sabase puraani punarbharaneey bydaree he
 Its energy-weight-ratio and energy-volume-ratio are very low, but it can provide a very high current for a short time, which means that the power-weight-ratio of its cells is very high
 in gunon ke alaava iskaa sasta hona, isko motargadiyon main prayukt hone ke liye aakarshak bana detaa he, kyonki vahno ko chaalu karte samay starter motor ko bahut adhik vidyut dhara kii jarurat padati he
 This battery is made up of one or several composite units, called cells
 prayek cell kaa vibhav do volt hota he
 Ordinary 6-volt automobile batteries have three cells graded
 prayek cell main amleey vidyut apghaty, jo praaia: salphurik amla hota he, tathaa apane do yaa adhik rasinic roopon main sis ke electrode rahete hai
 Electrodes are often called money or minus plates
 ye patticas sanrachaneey frem tathaa vidyut chaalak se yukt rahati hai, jise grid kehete hai
 The grid is made of metallic lead or alloy and active lead
 sakriy grid lead avkaash ko bharta he tathaa aavashyak vidyut rasinic kaary karata he
 The grid is made by alloying with a low fractional percentage of lead, antimony, tin, bismuth, arsenic and other elements
 dhan patitaka main sakriy padaarth lead paroxide, he
 The active substances of the loan strip are: porous, finely divided, self-bonding metallic pure lead and low-cost material, whose function is to maintain stability
 bydaree ke jeevankaal main rin pattica baar-baar aaweshit or visarjeet hoti he, at: rin patitaka kii sanrandhrata ko banaae rakhan ke liye yojya padaarthon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 By placing a separator in the middle of the alternating money and loan plates, separate these two plates and arrange the time
 pruthakkaarak dhan or rin patticoon ko ek duusare se chune se bachaata he
 The separator must be acid resistant and easily permeable for electrolytes and electrolytes
 yah pargamyata sookshm sanrandhra honi chahie jisase bydaree kii kriya ke samay dhan patticoon se nikalate hue sakriy padaarthon ke kanon kaa pravesh na ho
 The posterior part of the debt plate of the separator is flat and the opposite side of the money plate is flat or striped
 saamanyat: lakdi kaa upyog pruthakkaarak ke rup main adhik hota he
 Most of the resins and acids used for separators are extracted by chemical reaction
 deodaar kii kuch kismon kii lakdi pruthakkaarak ke liye atyuttam siddh hui he : sookshm randhra vaale rabar ke kritrim pruthakkaarak kaa upyog bhi atyadhik kiya ja rahaa he
 Artificial separators are used to withstand high temperatures related to climate or variable charge rates
 pruthakkari ko sanrandhra padaarth kii, jaise shishe ke tantu yaa chhidril rabar kii, sahaayak chadar se prachlit kar diya jaataa he
 This vowel is placed opposite the side of the money plate
 jab bydaree adhik kaary karti he, tab iske jeevankaal main yah prabalan sakriy padaarth ke chhadak ke niyantran main sahaayak hota he
 In a lead acid battery, the electrolyte is usually diluted sulfuric acid, which changes along with the state of charge of the battery
 jab bydaree aaweshit rahati he, tab salphurik amla kii tanuta adhik hoti he or bydaree ke visarjeet ho jane par amla sandra hota jaataa he
 When the batteries are fully charged, the relative dissipation of the electrolytes of most batteries is about 1
280, but this density is 1
125 in hot climates and 1
300 in frosty climates
 saamanyat:, vidyut apghaty kaa 1
15 aapekshik ghanatv is baat kaa dyotak he ki bydaree 90 pratishat visarjeet ho chuki he
 When the accumulator remains charged, lead, minus plaque and lead oxide, act as money plates
 ye donon patticas salphurik amla ke vidyut apghaty main dubi rahati he
 During the immersion, chemical changes take place in the active substance and electrolytes
 rin pattica kaa lead do electron,, se vanchit hota, jabaki dhan pattica kaa lead oxide do electron arjeet karata he
 The following reaction takes place on a loan board: dhan pattica par nimnlikhit samakalik abhikriya hoti he : Lead monoxide reacts with sulfuric acid to produce the following fruits: visarjan kaal main dhan or rin donon patticas lead sulphate se aachhadit ho jaati hai
 At this time the relative density of electrolytes, ie, sulfuric acid, decreases, because some sulfuric acid is converted into water
 bydaree ke kriyasheel rahete samay jis disha main dhara chalati he uske vipareet dhara pravaahit kar bydaree ko aaweshit kiya jaataa he, jiske kaaran bydaree apni mul dasha ko pun: praapt kar leti he, arthath dhan pattica kaa lead sulphate, lead oxide kii purvavastha main aa jaataa he
 Thus the hydrogen ion on the minus plate frees two electrons
 isaki abhikriya nimnlikhit he : The sulfate ion liberates two electrons on the fillet, the reaction of which is as follows: chunki plumbik sulphate pani main sthaayee nahin he, at: antim abhikriya is prakaar hoti he : The relative density of the electrolyte is increased by the reaction of charge
 aavesh or visarjan kaa chakra us samay tak chalata rahata he, jab tak bydaree kii bhautik sanrachana vaidyut apghaton ke kaaran yaa pruthakkaarak padaarth ke oxikaran ke kaaran nasht nahin ho jaati
 The efficiency of the battery is affected by the change of heat
 nimna taap nimna dakshata kaa kaaran hota he
 The efficiency of the battery also depends on the rate at which the battery is charged and immersed

 Several months later, at the same house, crime writer Alison Oswalt shifts with her family to write her new book, along with her wife Tracy and two children, 7-year-old Ashlee, who is fond of art-painting on walls and 12 years old Trevor
 Although the local sheriff there instructs him not to shift from here, Allison is aware that a murder has occurred in this house and he will leave after investigating the matter
 ghar kii jaanch dauraan ellison ko chat kii atic-rum se ek baks baraamad hoti he, par baks hataane dauraan vahaan ek bada bichchhu miltaa he jise vah maar detaa he
 Alison also wants to write her book on this murder as an incident because Stephanie, the last 10-year-old girl in the family after the murder, is mysteriously cowed
 idhar ghar main tahakikat se mili baks se ek home projector or 8mm kii standard film negative kii reel cese se ellison ko shurumen sabhi maamuli gharelu home-movie lag rahi thi wo aakhir main us parivaar kii bhayaavah ant kii gavaah he
 For example, the family drowned in a pool in a pool, the whole family was burnt alive in a closed car fire, in a rainy night, cutting dead people instead of cutting grass from the lawn remover, late night the whole family was asleep in a dagger Karanna and the last film where four people are hanged at a court
 is nirmam hatya ko dekhne par ellison kaa dil baith sa jaataa he, yahaan tab usne pool party vaale film main ek or rahasyamay shaks ko paata he or ek ajeeb sa nishaan bhi, or aisa pichhali har film main bhi dekhne ko miltaa he, phir to vah in sabaki ek-ekkar photo printout nikaalata he
 Meanwhile, the light is cut and some sound is heard coming from the attic room of the roof, when Alison reaches there with the help of his DG cam flash, he finds him moving the lid of the projector box, with the rod
 On removing it, a vicious snake crawls out of it
 yahaan us dhakkan par gaur karne use un sami katl kiye gaye parivaar kaa hubahu sketch miltaa he, ellison in sabaki tasviren letaa he, saath hi usee shaks kaa sketch bhi miltaa he jise mi

 Alison was about to leave the Attic room when the floor collapses, despite falling somehow, he falls badly and gets hurt on the feet

 The case study shows that all the families happened on different dates and in the city, the similarity is the mysterious disappearance of a child only after the death of each family
 Before the death of the family member to get some kind of intoxication so that they do not struggle in the time of murder
 or harek film main rahsaymay shaks kii maujudagi or ek shaitani nishaan kaa paaya janaa

 In the evening watching the film of Alison Law Work '86, the scenes of the slayers are shaken, after calming themselves, they would meet with Professor Jonas on an online chat to which Mr
 Bugiman and the traces depicted in the film relate to the medieval era Baghuul who murders the family in various ways and takes a child from the real world to enslave him to his elusive world
 haalaanki professor ke mutabik yah mahaj ek kahani hi he, to ellison bhi ise sirf ittefaq maanata he
 Then by closing his office, Alison would go to sleep at 3 in the morning and is shocked to hear the sound of the projector running around, but there is no one there when he reaches the office, fearing that he takes the base of the basement club, and heads to his back
 Without the eyes of the same missing children behind, they hide
 vah eshli ke kamare bhi jaataa jahaan wo ek najar dekh darwaja band kar lautataa he, par eshli kii najare steffni par thi jo diwaar saamne usee tasviir ke saath baithi thi jiskaa parivaar ke darkht par fande lagaae log the jisamen bughuul kaa bhi cheharaa tha
 Tired, Alison falls asleep on the couch holding the baseball-club, awake until the next morning
 jaagane par ellison phir offis ke cabin jaataa he, jahaan wo film or projector vaise hi pade rahete he, or baad main dipti sivensky se raat kii aapbeetee sunaata he, dipti use apane vaham ko apni jindagi main haaavee hone se bachane ko mashwara detaa he
 On the other hand, Tracy comes to Alison complaining to Ashley that she is drawing outside the room, but according to Ashley, all this is done by the same Stephanie as Alison is writing her book
 baad main traisi kaa sabar tut jaataa he uske mutabik ellison ne jis ghar par katl kii kitaab likh rahaa he, ab unheen kaa parivaar khatre main aa gaya he
 Here Alison also makes her argument that she only hid this truth for the sake of her family, she had no idea of its effect, and she cannot leave from here without completing her book
 In this debate and argument, almost both are broken
 der shaam apni galati kaa ehsaas hone donon aapasi sulah kar lete hai, or usee raat gahari neend main soya ellison projector chalane kii aawaaj se uth jaataa, offis main nadaarad paane aawaaj kaa peechha karte hue vah atic room jane raste pahunchataa he, chat jane kii seedhiyaan khuli hui thi jisapar upar dekhne par ellison hairat se projector par chal rahi film ko vahi gaayab paanch bacchon ko baitha dekhtaa he, sabhi bachche uski ore dekhte hue khamosh rahane kaa ishara karte he, film main dikhataa daraavna bughuul achaanak hi uske chehre ke saamne aane par ellison dar se cheekhta hua sidhiyon se gir padataa he, udhar chat se wo projector or film me farsh par patakaaya jaataa he
 Allison burns all those things in the backyard, then decides to return to her previous home, taking Tracy and the two children together
 raste main gasht ke dauraan sharriff, ellison ko teji se gaadi chalaata dekh uskaa peechha kar roktaa he, ellison itnaa hi kahata he ki vah apane puraane ghar laut rahaa he or philhal koi kitaab nahin likh rahaa, phir sargent kuch jaruri hidaayat dekar ellison ko aage badhane detaa he
 By the next morning Alison shifts all the stuff to her old house, in the evening Alison sees laptop photos related to the professor's mailed bughuels, which seem to recall past events, revealed to the online professor, who He is looking at the pictures
 He is the vehicle of the Sultanate of Baguhaul and the movement of this real world, most of the pictures were destroyed by the former Christians by calling it illusory
 Aki no further incident
 ellison ko bhi ab lagane lagata he ki usne projector or film jalaakar musiibat se chhutkaaraa paa liya he, phir wo baaki sabhi record kii gai film ko delit kar detaa he
 Then Alison's surprise while keeping the attic room side when she finds the box with the same projector again and this time she gets some more extended clip reels of the extended film
 un ekstended cat andig kii aakhri filmon ke sire jodne darmyaan bhi dipti sivensky kii kaal bhi ellison us film kii puri essembal karne baad hi risive karte he
 According to the information received by the deputy, he has done a strict investigation of these incidents, according to him that each family used to live in the same house where the previous family was killed, and they die the next day after changing their house; Like before the arrival of the Stevens family, they st
 While staying at Lewis's house where the Miller family was killed, the Miller family first lived in dilazio's house where the dilazio family were killed in Laan, then the dilazio family first lived at the house of Cecromento where Martin The family was burnt alive in a car parked in their own garage, and Martin lived in the first house where that initial family died due to the people dipping on the bridge
 Has had almost Ellison also changed its whereabouts has come timeline of the incident, fears that the next victim now they can be
 dipti use chetate he ki kaatil unke ghar aas-paas ho saktaa he isliye saavdhaan rahe
 Allison, looking at the deputy's call, sees all the footage that the only missing children responsible for the murder of all the family so far were probably under the guise of Bughoul and disappearing in front of him
 ellison ab koi or kadam uthaata use apana sar chakraata mahasoos hota he, tab use apni kaaphi cap ke neeche ek note paper miltaa he jisamen likhaa hota he 'gudnit daddy' or phir ellison gash khaakar gir padataa he

 ellison ko hosh aane par khud ko, apni bivi traisi or bete trevor ko haath-paanv bandhe milte he, jahaan sabake munh main tepe chipki rahati he
 Here Ashley, with her ax and the same 8 mm camera, bends down on Alison, promising that she will make her famous again
 The next scene shows all the walls of the house and the dog-cats, unicorns and previous incidents of blood on the door

 Jayasi belonged to the Malik dynasty
 misramen senapati yaa pradhanmantri ko malik kehete the
 During the reign of the Khilji dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate, Alauddin Khilji appointed many Malikas to get his uncle killed, due to which the name became quite popular since that period
 iraan main malik jameendaar ko kaha jaataa tha va inke purvaj vahaan ke niglaam praant se aaye the or vahiin se unke purvajon kii padavi malik thi
 The descendants of Malik Muhammad Jayasi were disciples of the Ashrafi dynasty and were called Malik
 firoz shah tughlaq ke anusaar baarah hajaar sena ke risaldaar ko malik kaha jaataa tha
 Jayasi mentions Sheikh Burhan and Syed Ashraf as his gurus
 jaaysi kaa janm san 1500 ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 He was from a place called Jais in Uttar Pradesh
 unke naam main jaaysi shabd kaa prayog, unke upnaam kii bhaanti, kiya jaataa he
 This also indicates that he was a resident of Jais Nagar
 is sambandh main unka swayan bhi kahana he- This shows that the ancient name of that city was Udayan, where they had come for ten days like one reached, that is, they had started or taken birth in their mortal life and then they got a lot of happiness when they got restless
 
 jaais naam kaa ek nagar uttar pradesh ke raibareli jile main aaj bhi vartmaan he, jiskaa ek purana naam udyannagar 'udyanagar yaa ujjalik nagar' batalaaya jaataa he tathaa uske kanchana khurd naamak muhalle main malik mohammad jaaysi kaa janm-sthaan hona bhi kaha jaataa he
 Some people believe that no definite mention of his fixed date of birth or birth-year is found under any available composition of Jayasi
 ek sthal par ve kehete hai, On the basis of this, it can only be estimated that he may have been born sometime between 800 h and 900 H, accordingly sometime between 1397 AD and 1494 AD and after attaining the age of thirty years, he started the work of poetry
 Would have done padmavat kaa rachanakaal unhone 947 hi0 arthath 1540 i0 batalaaya he
 On the basis of the last part of Padmavat, it can also be said that by the time of writing it, he had grown old

 It is also famous to maintain livelihood by cultivating jayasi itself
 jaaysi ne apni kuch rachanaaon main apni guru-parampara kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 He says, Syed Ashraf, who was a dear saint, became a performer of the bright cult for me and he made my heart clean by lighting a lamp of love
 
 Jayasi was the common man and Kane
 ek manyata anusaar ve janm se aise hi the kintu adhiktar logon kaa mat he ki sheetala rog ke kaaran unka sharir vikrut ho gaya tha
 Jayasi himself has mentioned his existence as a poet - a gunman Muhammad Guni
 ab unki dahini yaa bain koun si aankh phooti thi, is bare main unheen ke is dohe ko sandarbh liya ja saktaa he: Muhammed left Disza, one Saravanan one eye
 iske anusaar yah bhi pratiti hoti he ki unhen baayein kaan se bhi unhen kam sunai padataa tha
 a story is heard in Jais that once Jaisi went to Sher Shah's court, he laughed seeing them
 tab inhone shant bhav se poocha - mohika hasasi, ki kohrhi? yani tu mujh par hansaa yaa us kumhaar par? tab shershah ne lajjit ho kar kshamaa maangi
 According to another belief, he did not go to Sher Shah's court, rather Sher Shah came to him after hearing his name

 King Ramsingh of Amethi considered him very much
 apane antim dinon main jaaysi amethi se kuch dur ek ghaney jangal main rahaa karte the
 People say that when the last time came near, they told the king of Amethi that i would die by the arrow of a hunter, on which the king refused to hunt in the surrounding forests
 jis jangal main jaaysi rahete the, usamen ek shikari ko ek bada baagh dikhaai padaa
 He fired at him fearfully
 paas ja kar dekha to baagh ke sthaan par jaaysi mare pade the
 Jayasi sometimes used to take this form of yoga
 kaaji nasruddin hossain jaaysi ne, jinhen avadh ke nawab shujauddula se sanad mili thi, malik mohammad kaa mrityukaal rajjab 949 hijri bataaya he
 According to this, his death proves to be less than 49 years old, but what Jayasi has described in old age in the epilogue of 'padmavat' seems to be automatic
 jaaysi kii kabr amethi ke raja ke vartmaan mahal se lagbhag teen-chathai mile ke lagbhag he
 This present fort is built long after Jayasi's death
 amethi ke raajaaon kaa purana kila jaaysi kii kabr se dedh kos kii duuri par tha
 Therefore, the belief is prevalent that the king of Amethi had a son with the blessings of Jayasi and he built his grave near his fort, is baseless
 is baat ke bhi pramaan milte hai ki amethi naresh inke sangrakshak the
 According to another belief, he died in 1558
 unki 21 rachanaaon ke ullekh milte hai jisamen padmavat, akharavat, aakiri kalam, kaharanama, chitrarekha aadi pramukh hai
 But the basis of his fame is the Padmavat Granth

 Ratnasen's first wife Nagmati has a unique account of disconnection
 isaki bhashaa avadhi he or isaki rachana-style par adikaal ke jain kaviyon kii doha chaupai paddati kaa prabhaav padaa he
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has ranked Jayasi as a prominent poet in the count of medieval poets
 sivakumar mishra ke anusaar shukla ji kii drushti jab jaaysi kii kavi pratibha kii ore gai or unhone jaaysi granthawali kaa sampadan karte hue unhen pratham shrenee ke kavi ke rup main pahachaanaa, uske pehle jaaysi ko is rup main nahin dekha or saraahaa gaya tha
 According to this, it seems natural that the poetic genius of Jaisi seems to be at the level of the medieval veteran poet Goswami Tulsidas
 isi kaaran se unhen tulsi ke samaksh jaaysi se bada kavi nahin dikhaa
 According to Shukla ji, the area of jaisi is narrower than that of Tulsi, but Premvedana is highly esoteric

6 billion years history is as follows- Periodic extinctions have temporarily reduced diversity, eliminating: Dates are approximate
 In this timeline, Ma means "million years ago", ka means "thousand years ago", and ya means "years ago"
 4000 Ma and earlier
 4000 Ma – 2500 Ma Bacteria develop primitive forms of photosynthesis which at first do not produce oxygen
 These organisms generate ATP by exploiting a proton gradient, a mechanism still used in virtually all organisms
 2500 Ma – 542 Ma 542 Ma - present The Phanerozoic Eon, literally the "period of well-displayed life", marks the appearance in the fossil record of abundant, shell-forming and / or trace-making organisms
 It is subdivided into three eras, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, which are divided by major mass extinctions
 542 Ma - 251
0 Ma Four-limbed tetrapods gradually gain adaptations which will help them occupy a terrestrial life-habit
 Major extinctions in terrestrial vertebrates and large amphibians

 Global warming means the increase in the mean temperature of the Earth's near-surface air and ocean temperatures since the 20th century and its approximate continuity

 The inter-government panel sitting on climate change concludes that "the increase in the world's average temperature since the middle of the 20th century is primarily due to man-made greenhouse gases
" jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he, dharti ke vaataavaran ke taapmaana main lagaataar ho rahi vishwavyaapee badhotaree ko 'global varming' kaha ja rahaa he
 Our earth receives heat from the sun's rays
 ye kirane vayumandal se guzarati huin dharti kii sataha se takaraati hai or phir vahiin se paravartit hokar pun: laut jaati hai
 The Earth's atmosphere is made up of several gases, including some greenhouse gases
 inamen se adhikansh dharti ke upar ek prakaar se ek prakritik aavaran bana leti hai jo lautati kirnon ke ek hisse ko roak letaa he or is prakaar dharti ke vaataavaran ko garm banaae rakhata he
 It is worth noting that at least 16 degree Celsius temperature is necessary for humans, creatures and plants to survive
 vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki greenhouse gaison main badhotaree hone par yah aavaran or bhi saghan yaa motaa hota jaataa he
 In such a situation, this cover starts to prevent more rays of the sun and then from here the effects of global warming begin
 ipisisi dwaara diye gayi jalwaayu parivartan ke model ingit karte hai ki dharaatal kaa ausat global taapmaana 21veen shatabdi ke dauraan or adhik bad saktaa he
 This rise in the temperature of the whole world can cause sea level rise, rise in extreme weather and significant changes in the amount and composition of rainfall
 global varming ke anya prabhaavon main krishi upaj main parivartan, vyapaar margon main sanshodhan, glacier kaa peeche hatana, prajatiyon ke vilupt hone kaa khatra aadi shaamil hai
 "global warming" refers to the warming in recent decades and its persistence, and its indirect effects on humans
 jalwaayu parivartan par sanyukt raashtra samjhaute kii ruparekha main "maanav dwaara kiye gaye parivartanon ke liye "jalwaayu parivartan or anya parivartano ke liye "jalwaayu parivartanshiltaa" shabd kaa istemaal kiya he
 The term "climate change" assumes that rising temperatures are not the only effect
 The term "anthropogenic global warming" is used many times when the focus is on human-induced change
 prithvi kii jalwaayu bahari dabaav ke chalate parivartit hoti rahati he jisamen surya ke chaaron ore iske apni kaksha main hone vaale parivartan bhi shaamil hai
 The pressure on the orbit also changes the concentration of solar flashes, volcanic eruptions, and atmospheric greenhouse gases

 This credit goes to the most recent 50 years for which data are available
 aam sahmati ke vichaar se alag kuch anya sankalpanaaon kaa suzav adhikansh taapmaana vruddhi kii vyakhya karne ke liye diya jaataa he
 One such hypothesis proposes that heat can be a result of solar activity in different forms
 baadhyataa kaa koi bhi prabhaav taatkaalik nahin he
 The heat inertia of the Earth's oceans and the slow response to many indirect effects mean the Earth's current temperature is not in equilibrium with the pressure exerted on it
 Studies of climate commitment show that if greenhouse gases are stabilized at 2000 levels So to some extent even beyond this
 garmi dikhaai degi The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fournier and was first quantitatively investigated in 1896 by Scenti Arness
 yah prakriya dwaara jo avasorana or utsarjan ke avarakt vikiran dwaara vaataavaran main garm gaisen vaataavaran main ek or grah kii sataha kam he
 The existence as a greenhouse effect is thus not disputed
 swaabhaavik rup se green house gaison ke paas hone kaa matlab he ek garmi ke prabhaav ke bare main 33 degree celsius, jo prithvi par rahane yogya nahin honge
 
 Important greenhouse gases on the earth are water vapor, which produces 36–70 percent greenhouse effect); carbon dioxide that produces up to 9–26 percent greenhouse effect; methane up to 4-9 percent and ozone, which produces up to 3-7 percent effect
 The issue is how the power of the greenhouse effect changes when atmospheric concentrations of certain greenhouse gases increase from human activity
 audyogic kranti ke baad se maanvi gatividhi main vruddhi hui he jiske kaaran green house gaison ki maatra main bahut jiyaada vruddhi hui he, iske kaaran vikaranshil baadhya CO se2, methane, tropospheric ozon, siefasi or s nitrous bhi bahut bad gaye hai Iagara anu ki drushti se dekhen to methane greenhouse gasccharbon dioxide kii tulana main adhik prabhavi he, par uski sandratha itani kam he ki uskaa vikaranshil jor carbon dioxide ki tulana main keval ek chauthai he praaqatik rup se utpann hone vaali kuch duusari gaise greenhouse prabhaav main yogadan detii hai
 One of these nitrous oxide is developing due to human activities like agriculture! Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 have increased by 31% and 149% respectively since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700th century
 pichley 650,000 varshon ke dauraan kisi bhi samay se in staron ko kaaphi adhik mana ja rahaa he
 This is the period for which the reliable figures are ice cores
 Are derived from
 kam pratyaksh bhuvaigyanik pramaan se yah mana jaataa he ki CO2 kii itani zyada maatra pichhali baar 20 karod varsh pehle hui thi
 Burning of fossil fuels has increased at least one-third of the increase in CO2 from human activities in the last 20 years
 shesh kaary bhoomi ke upyog main parivartan ke kaaran se hota he visheshkar wanon kii kataai se aisa hota he
 Current vaso-atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are approximately 385 per million ppm) by volume
 bhavishya main CO2 kaa str zyada hone ki ashanka he kyunki jeevashm eendhan or bhoomi ke upyog main kaafii parivartan aa rahe hai vruddhi k dar anishchit aarthik, saamaajik, takneekee or prakritik ghatnaon par nirbhar karegi par shaayad aakhirkaar jeevashm eendhan kii uplabdhta hi nirnaayak sabit ho ipisisi kii utsarjan paridrishyon par vishesh report bhavishya ke kai CO2 paridrishyo ke bare main bataati he jo 2100 ke akhir tak 541 se lekar 970 pipiem tak ho sakate hai
 There are sufficient reserves of fossil fuels to reach this level and to continue emissions even after 2100 if coal, sand sand or methane claretrate are widely used
 jalwaayu par baadhk ghatakon ke prabhaav vibhinn prakriyaaon dwaara jatil ho jate hai
 One of the most obvious responses relates to water evaporation
 carbon daai oxide jaisi dirghakaalin greenhouse prabhaav vaali gaison ke milane se paidaa hone vaali garmi vayumandal main jal ke adhik maatra main vashpikaran kaa kaaran banataa he
 Because water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas, it makes the atmosphere even hotter and it changes more water vapor into B) and this reaction continues until the recycling cycle is stopped
 Its effect from oxide will be huge
 yadhyapi pratyuttar kii yah prakriya vaayu kii nami ke kanon main badhotari karti he, tab bhi saapeksh ardrata yaa to sthir rahati he yaa thodi si ghat jaati he kyonki vaayu garm ho jaati he
 This effect of response can only be reversed slowly as carbon dioxide has a longer atmospheric lifespan
 badalon se prabhavit hone vaale pratyuttar ek nirantar chalane vaali prakriya he
 Seen from below, the cloud emits infrared radiation back to the surface and exerts a heat effect, seen from above, the clouds and sunlight emit space to reflect infrared radiation and therefore exert a cooling effect
 shuddh prabhaav kya garm athwa thanda he yah badal kii kism or unchai jaise vivaranon par nirbhar karata he
 These descriptions on climate models are difficult to demonstrate because clouds are much smaller than the points between spaces on computer mines of climate models
 jaise jaise vayumandal garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise paramarshi pratyuttar kii prakriya chook dar main parivartan se sambandhit hoti he
 As the temperature in the troposphere increases, the temperature of the atmosphere decreases
 avarakt vikiran kaa utsarjan taapmaana kii chauthi shakti par nirbhar karata he, vaataavaran kii upari tah se zyada lambi vikiran utsarjit hoti he or nichali tah se yah kam hoti he
 Most of the radiation that is emitted from the upper atmosphere goes into the hole, while the radiation emitted from the lower atmosphere is again absorbed by the atmosphere
 is prakaar, green house prabhaav vaataavaran main taapmaana ke oonchai ke saath kam hone kii raftaar pe nirbhar karata he, agar taapmaana kii dar kam he to green house asar zyada hoga or agar taapmaana girane kii dar kam he to green house asar kam hoga
 Both the theory and the model indicate that warming will reduce the temperature drop with altitude, creating a negative lapse rate feedback and weakening the greenhouse effect
 oonchai ke saath taapmaana parivartan kii dar kaa maapan choti-choti trutiyon ke prati bahut savendenshil hota he, isse yah pataa karnaa bahut mushkil ho jaataa he ki model hakeekat se mail khaataa he ke nahin 
 Another important process is the ice 'albedo response when the global temperature increases, then the ice near the poles starts melting at a faster rate
 jaise jaise barf pighalati he vaise vaise bhoomi athwa khulaa jal uskaa sthsthaan le letaa he
 Both land and water are less reflective than ice and therefore absorb more amount of solar radiation
 isse adhik garmi ho jaati he jiske kaaran or adhik barf pighalane lagati he tathaa yah chakra chalata rahata he
 Positive reorientation that occurs due to the emission of CO2 and CH4 is another reason that increases warming
 yah gaisen jamate hue permphrost jaise kii jamaa hui lakdi, siberia main daldal se paidaa hoti hai
 Likewise, methane clathrate, which is found in the oceans, emits enormous amounts of CH4, can be a major cause of warming, as the clathrate gun hypothesis states
 jaise jaise samudr garm hota jaataa he vaise vaise carbon ko alag karne kii kshamta ghatati jaati he
 This is because the declining levels of nutrients in the mesopelagic region are impeding the development of diatoms and favor small phytoplankton that are biological pumps of carbon
 pichley 30 varshon se Some papers suggest that the Sun's contribution has been underestimated
 Duke University ke do shodhakartaaon, Bruce West or Nicola Scafetta ne yah anumaan lagaaya he ki surya ne 1900-2000 tak shaayad 45-50 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaane main yogadan diya he or 1980 or 2000 ke bich main lagbhag 25-35 pratishat tak taapmaana badhaaya he
 Climate models have been found by Peter Scott and other researchers to overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases and do not give much importance to solar forcing, suggesting that volcanic dust and sulfate aerosols are also underestimated
 Despite solar forcing, much of the warming is likely to be caused by greenhouse gases, especially from the mid-20th century

 It has also been suggested that the magnetic activity in the Sun also triggers cosmic rays which affect the condensation nuclei of clouds and also affect the climate

 Due to solar variation and volcanic activity, from the industrial age to the 1950s, the heat did not increase but only cooling

 According to the instrumental temperature record, the temperature of the Earth, whether on land or at sea, has increased from 1860–1900
 This increase in temperature is not affected by the urban heat island effect
 From 1079, the temperature of the land is almost double than the sea temperature
 The temperature in the lower troposphere is between 0
12 and 0
22 ° c per decade, as satellite data suggests
 It is believed that temperatures have remained relatively stable for the last one or two thousand years before 1850, with some regional fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period or the short icy era samudr main taapmaana zamin ke mukaable dhire badate hai kyunki mahasaagaron kii adhik heat capcity adhik hoti he or ve vashpikaran se jiada garmi kho sakate hanutari golardh main zamin jiada he isliye vah dakshini golardh kii tulana main jaldi garm hota he utari golardh main mausami barf or samudri barf ke vyapak ilaake hai jo kii ice-albedo feedback par nirbhar karte hai utari golardh main dakshini golardh ke mukaable adhik green house gaisen utsarjit kii jaati hai, par yah garmi main antar ke liye jimmedaar nahin he kyunki pramukh green house gaisen kaafii samay tak rahati hai or donon golardho main acchhee tarah ghul-mil jaati hai Based on estimates from nasa's Institute for Space Studies, 2005 was the hottest year, since the instrument of measurement became available in the late 1800s, breaking the 1998 record by a few hundredths of a degree from the World Meteorological Organization and Climate Research Unit The estimates drawn by 2005 concluded that 2005 was the second hottest year after 1998, as the temperature was unusually high in 1998 because that year El Niño's southern oscillations occurred Anthropogenic utsarjan ke anya pradooshak -visheshkar sulphate arosol sa-thanda karne vaala prabhaav daalate hai kyunki yah aati hui surya kii raushnee ko pratibimbit kar dete hai yah ek aanshik kaaran he us shitalan kaa jo beesvi sadi ke madhya main paaya gaya haalanki prakritik parivartanshiltaa ke kaaran bhi thandapan ho saktaa he
 James Hansen and his colleagues have proposed that the substances emitted from burning fossil fuels —CO2 and aerosols — have eliminated each other's effect, so the heat is mostly due to non-co2 greenhouse gases

 One day King Vikramaditya came to a high mountain while hunting
 vahaan unhone dekha ek sadhu tapasya kar rahaa he
 Thinking that the monk did not get disturbed in his penance, he returned to him by paying homage to him
 unke mudate hi sadhu ne awaz di or unhen rukne ko kaha
 Vikramaditya stopped and the monk pleased him and gave him a fruit
 usne kaha- "jo bhi is fal ko khayega tejasvi or yashasvi putr praapt karegaa
 "as he was returning after receiving the fruit, he looked at a fast-running woman
 daudte-daudte ek kune ke paas ai or chalaang lagane ko udyat hui
 Vikram held him and thus sought to know the reason for committing suicide
 mahila ne bataaya ki uski kai ladkiyaan hai par putr ek bhi nahin
 Since every time the girl is born, her husband is angry with her and abuses and molests her
 vah is durdasha se tang hokar aatmahatya karne ja rahi thi
 King Vikramaditya gave her sage fruit and assured her that if her husband eats the fruit, then this time she will have a son
 kuch din biit gaye
 One day a Brahmin came to Vikram and offered the same fruit to him
 vikram sree kii charitraheenta se bahut dukhi hue
 After saying goodbye to the Brahmin, he came to his wife with the fruit and gave it to her
 vikram kii patni bhi charitraheen thi or nagar ke kotwaal se prem karti thi
 He gave that fruit to the city Kotwal so that a grand son could be born in his house
 nagar kotwaal ek veshya ke prem main pagal tha or usne vah fal us veshya ko de diya
 The prostitute thought that even if the son of a prostitute is a million celebrity, he cannot get social status
 usne kaaphi sochane ke baad yah nishkarsh nikaala ki is fal ko khaane kaa asli adhikari raja vikramaditya hi he
 If his son is as capable and empowered as him, then the people will be well looked after and everyone will be happy
 yahi sochakar usne vikramaditya ko vah fal bhent kar diya
 Vikramaditya was deceived after seeing the fruit
 unhone padtaal karai to nagar kotwaal or rani ke avaidh sambandh kaa pataa chal gaya
 He became so sad and disgusted that leaving the kingdom as it was, he went to the forest and started doing hard penance
 chunki vikramaditya devataaon or manushyon ko samaan rup se priy the, devraj indra ne unki anupasthiti main rajya kii raksh ke liye ek shaktishaalee dev bhej diya
 That god started guarding and guarding the non-stateless state with great vigor
 kuch dinon ke baad vikramaditya kaa man apni praja ko dekhne ko karne laga
 When he tried to enter his kingdom, Dev stood in front
 use apni vaastavik pahchaan dene ke liye vikram ne usase yuddh kiya or parajeet kiya
 The defeated god agreed that the one who defeated him was Vikramaditya and he told him that an enemy of his previous birth has come here and is accomplishing
 vah unhen khatm karne kaa har sambhav prayaas karegaa
 If Vikram killed him, he would rule uninterrupted for a long time
 yogi ke bare main sab kuch bataakar us dev ne raja se anumati lee or chalaa gaya
 By then Vikram's characterless wife was dead by consuming poison
 vikram ne aakar apana rajpaat sambhaal liya or rajya kaa sabhi kaam sucharupurvak chalane laga
 After a few days, that yogi arrived in his court
 usne vikram ko ek aisa fal diya jise kaatane par ek keemtee laal niklaa
 In exchange for reward, he wished Vikram to help him
 vikram saharsha taiyaar ho gaye or uske saath chal pade
 When both of them reached the crematorium, the yogi told that Betal is hanging on a tree and he needs Betal for a perfection
 usne vikram se anurodh kiya ki ve vetaal ko utaar kar uske paas le aaen
 Vikram tried to bring Betal out of the tree and loaded it on his shoulder
 vetaal baar-baar unki asaavadhaanee kaa phayda uthaa kar ud jaataa or ped par latak jaataa
 This has happened twenty four times
 har baar vetaal raste main vikram ko ek kahani sunaata
 For the twenty-fifth time Betal tells Vikram that the yogi who sent him to bring him is evil and deceitful
 uski tantric siddhi kii aaj samaapti he tathaa aaj vah vikram kii bali de degaa jab vikram devi ke saamne sar jhukayegaa
 Only by the king's sacrifice can his accomplishment be fulfilled
 vikram ko turant indra ke dev kii chetavanee yaad ai
 He thanked Betal and brought him to Yogi
 yogi use dekhakar atyant harsith hua or vikram se devi ke charnon main sar jhukaane ko kaha
 Vikram asked the yogi to tell him the method of bowing his head
 jyonhi yogi ne apana sar devi charnon main jhukaaya ki vikram ne talwaar se uski gardan kaat di
 Devi was pleased to receive the sacrifice and gave Vikram two betal servants
 unhone kaha ki samaran karte hi ye donon vetaal vikram kii seva main upasthit ho jaayenge
 Having received the blessings of Vikram Devi, she happily returned to the palace
