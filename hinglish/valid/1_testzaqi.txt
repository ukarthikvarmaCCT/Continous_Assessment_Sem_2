 There was a lot of excitement and a crazy madness
 jin pahaado par aaj bhi chadh paanaa dushwaar he or jin ghaatiyon ko dekhakar hosh phakhta ho jate hai, unamem se yoddhaon ne nikal-nikalakar naag jaisaa vyuh rach diya tha

 aakhir maharana pratap kaa yug kaisaa tha ? us kaal kaa samaaj or samskruti kisi thi ? babar ke akraman ke dauraan desh kii sabase badi takat mewar kya hameshaa ke liye shant ho gaya ? shershah ke baad, babar ke pautra akbar ne mewar ke maan-mardan ke liye sari maryaadaayen laangh di magar kya vajah thi ki mewar ke jakhmi haathon main balandi ke jhande bane rahe
 Despite all the half-dozen attacks and campaigns and wars of Akbar, Maharana Pratap was not the victim of all dignity

 Pratap did not accept anything in the name of writing in self-praise, otherwise his court would also have Kai Abul Fazl and Faizi
 yaad nahin ki pratap ne apni prashansa main kaai granth likhvaya ho
 No Pushpika of praise is found even during Pratap's lifetime, yes Chakrapani Mishra definitely wrote a single verse praising Pratap
 adhikansh itihaaskaaron ne pratap ko akhabar kii mukhaalafat karne vaale yoddha ke rup main hi chitrit kiya he
 Described by the Mughals as a person who is a hindrance in the way of the intention of tying the country to the thread of unity

 Riots reached Delhi in a few days
 is vakt menon ko laga ki montbayton jaise vyakti kii anupasthiti main, rajdhani kii haalat or bigad sakati he
 In consultation with Sardar Patel, Menon decided to call Mountbatten back to India
 patel ne khule haathon se is yojana ko sweekaar kiy
 An emergency commission was created, with Montbatten presided over, and after four months and many losses on and off the border, the riots were over
 visaroi kii patni ne anutosh or kshem parishad kaa aayojan kiya jisaki adhyksha ve khud bani
 Riots were stopped to an extent due to Menon's quick-witted wisdom
 swatantraaa ke baad, menon sardaar patel ke adhin,rajya mantralay ke sachiv banaae gaye
 Menon had a very close relationship with Patel
 patel menon kii raajnneetik kushalta or kaary-prapti par prabhavit the, jiske kaaran menon ko vahiin pratishtha mili jisaki ek prashaasak apane se varisht vyakti se ummid karata he
 Staying close to Menon Patel, he joined hands in connecting 565 states with India
 paramsatta kaa sthanantaran jab visaroi dwaara hone ko tha, tab menon ne patel ko nirdesh diya ki raajaaon ko agar pratiraksha or videshkarya ke saath agar sampresson kaa bhi bhagador agar bharat sarkaar ko mil jaaen, to ekikaran kaa kaam aasaan ho saktaa he
 He also advised to take help of Mountbatten
 patel ke neeche sachiv hote, rajyon ke ekikaran ke vakt denevalali patel kaa bayaan, menon ne hi taiyaar kiya tha
 Influenced by the President of the United States, Mr
 Abraham Lincoln, this statement is very interesting

 While working under Viseroi, Menon was against giving states an independent status
 asi yojana par unhone istipha dene kii dhamkee di thi
 Menon did not leave his position only after being persuaded by Viseroi's wife
 menon ke kaushal par vishwaas hone ke kaaran,kabhi-kabhi apane nirdeshon ko paar karke kaam karne par bhi patel menon ke yojanon ko thukaraate nahin the
 Menon played an important role in the risky task of matching states like Junagadh and Hyderabad with India, and advised Nehru and Patel to maintain contact with Pakistan after the Kashmir problem
 mantrimandal ne kashmir ke maamle kii suzav ke liye 1947 main menon ko hi chunaa tha
 Visroi wanted to reward Mountbatten Menon with the "knight's title", but it did not suit Menon to accept this title as a servant of the new government
 patel or menon ke bich kii rishta amuly tha
 Menon was like Patel's left hand and played an important role in the unity of independent India

 Some Congress workers wanted to harass the administration service, because these officers were involved in their arrest

 But Menon was appointed as the Governor of Odisha in 1951

 If Menon had not planned to connect different nations to the Central Government with the support of Mountbatten in Simla, India's map would have been different today

 The surprising thing is that no one has written his autobiography till date

 Organic foods are made in such a way that the use of synthetic materials during production can be limited or eliminated
 Agriculture can be described as biotic for much of human history; Artificial chemicals were supplied in large quantities for food supplies only during the 20th century
 utpaadan kii is naveenatam style ko "parmaanu rahit" kaha jaataa he
 Under organic production, the use of non-toxic non-pesticides, pesticides and medicines is prohibited and is safe as a last resort
 haalanki, aam dharna ke vipareet kuch ajaivik urvarkon kaa upyog abhi bhi kiya jaataa he
 If animals are included, they should be reared without the regular use of antibiotics and growth hormones and should usually be fed a healthy diet
 In most countries, biological production is not genetically modified

 The Soil Association) is the first biological certifier to implement nano-exclusion
 jaivik khaadya utpaadan atyant viniyamit udyog he, jo nijee bagwani se bhinn he
 Currently, the European Union, United States, Canada, Japan and many other countries require manufacturers to obtain special certification allowing them to sell the diet in "organic" form within their borders
 Most certifications allow the use of certain chemicals and pesticides, so consumers should be aware of the standards based on which foods are considered "organic" in their respective sites
 aitihaasik rup se, for historical use jaivik krishi apekshaakrit chote parivaar dwaara chalaaye jane vaale kaary he, isliye ek samay jaivik khaanaa keval chote bhandaron or chote kisaanon ke bazaar main hi uplabdh tha
 However, the growth rate of organic food production since the 1990s is around 20% a year, much higher than the rest of the food industry in both developed and developing countries
 april 2008 main jaivik khaadya padaarth kii bikri duniya bhar main khaadya padaarth kii bikri kii tulana main 01-02% he
 In 1939 Lord Northbourne, in his book Look to the Land, coined the term organic agriculture out of the concept of "a farm as an organism" to describe the perfectionist, ecologically balanced method of agriculture - the opposite of which he chemically Farming, which is dependent on "import breeding" and "can never be either self-sufficient nor completely organic
" " yah "jaivik" shabd ke vaigyanik prayog se alag he, jiskaa aashay carbnayukt anuon ke ek varg se he vishesh rup se jo jivan ke rasayan shaastra main shaamil he
 Refined organic food usually includes only organic ingredients

 Former consumers interested in organic food prefer non-chemically nourished, fresh or less processed food
 unhen zyaadaatar sidhe utpaadakon se khareednaa padataa tha: "apane kisaan ko jaano, apane khaadya ko pahachaano" unka adarsh tha
 Personal definitions of the elements participating in the creation of "organic" were developed through direct experience: talking to farmers, observing the condition of the fields, and farming activities
 pramanikaran praapt kar yaa pramanikaran ke bina jaivik kheti kii prathaon kaa upyog kar chote-chote kheton main subjiyan ugaai gai or vyaktigat upabhokta kii nigaraanee kii gai
 As the demand for organic foods increased, more and more sales through large shops like supermarkets started replacing the direct contact with farmers
 Nowadays there is no limit for organic farms and many large companies currently have an organic department
 haalanki, supermarket upabhoktaaon ke liye, khaadya utpaadan aasaani se dikhaai dene yogya nahin he or utpaada labling jaise "pramanit jaev" par nirbhar he
 It is up to government regulations and third-party inspectors to assure all these things
 ek "pramanit jaivik" label aam taur par upabhoktaaon ke paas yah pataa karne ke liye ekmaatr tarika he ki sansaadhit utpaada "jaivik" he yaa nahin
 The USDA does not inspect organic farmers
 30 teesri party nirikshakon main se 15 nirikshakon ko ankekshan ke baad pariviksha ke tahat rakhaa jaataa he
 On 20 April 2010, the Department of Agriculture stated that it would begin implementing regulations due to the need to test biologically generated foods for pesticide discovery after the auditor revealed major gaps in a mutually accepted inspection of the organic food industry 
 pramanit jaivik hone ke liye, utpaadon ko is tarah viksit or nirmit kiya janaa chahie jisase ve us desh ke nirdhaarit maanakon kaa paalan kar sake jiske tahat unhen bechaa jaataa he: Numerous surveys and studies have been done to compare and examine traditional and biological systems of farming
 in surveykshanon main saamaanya sarvasammati yah he ki jaivik krishi nimnlikhit kaarnon ke kaaran kam hanikaarak hai: However, some critics of organic farming methods believe that organic farms require more land than traditional farms to produce the same amount of food
 He argues that if this is true, organic farms can potentially destroy rainforests and wipe out many ecosystems
 anya reporton ke samaan britain main 2003 main paryaavaran khaadya or gramin maamalon ke vibhaag dwaara jaanch main paaya gaya ki jaivik krishi "sakaaratmak paryaavarniya laabh kaa utpaadan kar sakati he", lekin agar kshetra ke bajaay utpaadan ikai ke aadhaar par tulana kii jaati he to kuch laabh kam ho jate hai yaa kho jate hai

 Biological methods can produce sufficient food on a global per capita basis for a large population even without maintaining the current human population and possibly increasing the share of agricultural land
 shodhakartaaon ne yah paaya he ki viksit deshon main ausatan jaivik pranali paramparaagat krishi dwaara utpaadit upaj kaa 92% utpaadan karti he, vikasshil deshon main jaivik pranali paaramparik kheton kii tulana main 80% adhik utpaadan karti he kyonki kuch garib deshon main synthetic saamagree kii tulana main jaivik krishi ke liye aavashyak saamagree kisaanon ko zyada aasaani se uplabdh ho jaati he
 On the other hand, communities that lack sufficient manure to replenish the soil struggle with organic agriculture and the soil degrades rapidly

 iske antargat aushadhon kaa gyaan tathaa unka sangyojan hi nahin varan unki pahchaan, sangrakshan, nirmaan, vishleshan tathaa pramapan bhi hai
 The invention and synthesis of new drugs are the main functions of pharmaceuticals

 William Shakespeare - 23 April 1616) was an English poet, poetical scholar, playwright and actor
 unke naatakon kaa lagbhag sabhi pramukh bhashaaon main anuwaad hua he
 Shakespeare had a very high prolific talent as well as an intuitive knowledge of the rules of art
 prakruti se unhen maano vardaan mila tha at: unhone jo kuch chhu diya vah sona ho gaya
 His creations are not only an object of pride for the British caste, but are also immortal Vibhuti of the world universe
 shakespeare kii kalpana jitani prakhar thi utana hi gambhir unke jivan kaa anubhav bhi tha
 Therefore, on the one hand, his plays and his poems bring joy to the achievement, on the other hand we get serious biography from his works
 vishwasahitya ke itihaas main shakespeare ke samakaksh rakhe janevaale virale hi kavi milte hai
 William Shakespeare was the eldest son and third child of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden
 inkaa janm stretford aan evan main hua
 During his childhood, he was educated at the local Free Grammar School
 pita kii badhati hui aarthik kathinaaiyon ke kaaran unhen paathshaala chhodkar chote mote dhandhon main lag janaa padaa
 He decided to go to London for a living
 is nishchay kaa ek doosraa kaaran bhi tha
 Perhaps he had to leave his birthplace in fear of legal proceedings towards the theft of deer from the garden of Sir Thomas Loose, the landlord of Charl Kot
 unka vivaah san 1582 main en hathave se ho chukaa tha
 Around 1585, Shakespeare came to London
 shuru main unhone ek rangashaala main kisi choti naukari par kaam kiya, kintu kuch dinon ke baad ve lard chemberlen kii company ke sadsy ban gaye or landan kii pramukh rangashaalaon main samay samay par abhinay main bhaag lene lage
 After eleven years, he returned to Stratford upon Avon in 1596 and now he strengthened his family's financial system
 san 1597 main inhone dhire dhire navnirmaan evam vistaar kiya
 After 1610, he started spending more and more time in this building and he died there in 1616
 shakespeare kii rachanaaon ke tithikram ke sambandh main kaaphi matbhed he
 In 1930, the famous scholar Sir E
K
 The table that Chambers presented on Tithikrama is generally accepted today
 tab bhi idhar pichley varshon kii khoj se tithiyon ke sambandh main kuch naveen dharanaayen bani hai
 On the basis of these new discoveries, Mac Manway sir has prepared a new table which Sir E
K
 The list of Chambers is somewhat different
 lagbhag 20 varshon ke saahitiyik jivan main shakespeare kii sarjanaatmak pratibha nirantar viksit hoti gai
 In general, four different stages are seen in this development
 praarambhik avasthaa 1595 main samaapt hui
 Almost all the works of this period are experimental
 shakespeare abhi tak apana maarg nishchit nahin kar paae the, atev vibhinn prachlit rachanapranaliyon ko kram se karyanvit karke apana rachanavidhan susthir kar rahe the, pracheen sukhaant naatakon kii prahasanatmak style main unhone 'di kamedi ov erars' or 'di teming of di su' kii rachana kii
 Subsequently, in 'love's Labors Lost', he followed the pattern of Lily's courtly pleasures
 isamen rajdurbar kaa vaataavaran upasthit kiya gaya he jo chatur paatro ke rochak vaartalap se paripurna he
 'the Two Gentlemen of Verona' imitates Greene's romanticistic pleasantries
 du:khant naatak bhi anukaranaatmak hai
 In 'richard III' the goods are imitated and in 'titus Andronicus' the Kid is followed but in 'romeo and Juliet' the element of origin is relatively high
 isi kaal main likhi hui donon prasiddh kavitaayen 'di rape aav lukris' or 'venus and adonis' par tatkaaleen italian premakavy kii chhap he
 The second phase of development ended in 1600
 isamen shakespeare ne anek praudh rachanaayen sansar ko bhent kin
 Now he had set his path and gained confidence
 'e mid samar nits dream' tathaa 'di marchent aav venice' rochak evam lokapriy sukhaant naatak hai kintu inase bhi adhik mahatv rakhanevaale shakeyapear ke sarvotkrisht sukhaant naatak 'much ado ebout nathing', 'aij you like it' tathaa 'twailvath nite' isi kaal main likhe gaye
 In these plays, the imagination of the poet and the pleasure of his mind are well published
 sarvottam aitihaasik naatak bhi isi samay likhe gaye
 Marlowe-influenced 'richard II' is far more successful in composition than the previous category of the same category, 'richard III'
 'henry chaturth' ke donon bhaag or 'henry pancham' jo suvikhyath aitihaasik naatak hai, isi kaal kii rachanaayen hai
 Almost all of Shakespeare's sonnets, which are unique for their excellent expression, were written between 1595 and 1607
 teesri avasthaa, jiskaa ant lagbhag 1607 main hua, shakespeare ke jivan main vishesh mahatv rakhti he
 The poet's mind was distressed over the years due to family misfortune and health problems
 at: in dinon kii adhikansh rachanaayen du:khant hai
 The worldly sorrow drama Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, and the Roman sorrow drama Julius Caesar, 'antoine and Cleopatra' and 'coriolanus' were written and played during this period
 'travaylas and cracida', 'als wel dait ands wel' or 'major for major' main sukh or du:kha kii sanshlisht abhivyakti hui he, tab bhi du:khad ansh kaa hi praadhanya he
 In the final stages of development, Shakespeare created Perrickles, Sinvelin, 'the Winters Tale', 'the Tempest' Prabhriti plays, which, despite being peaceful, filled with sad possibilities and created an evening atmosphere
 in sukhaant du:khant naatakon ko romance athwa shakespeare ke antim naatakon kii sangya di jaati he
 Shakespeare's pleasant plays have their own personal characteristics
 yadhyapi 'di kamedi aav erars' main platus kaa anusaran kiya gaya he tathaapi anya sukhaant naatak pracheen clasiki naatakon se sarvatha bhinn hai
 Their purpose is not to eradicate the deformities and improve the errors by the skit, but to entertain people through interesting story and characterization
 is prakaar ke praaia: sabhi naatakon kaa vishay prem kii aisi teevr anubhuti he jo yuvakon or yuvatiyon ke man main sahaj aakarshan ke rup main swat: utpann hoti he
 Obstacles first come in the way of the lovers but by the end of the play the difficulties are overcome and they result
 in rachanaaon main jivan kii kavitvapurn evam kalpanapravan abhivyakti hui he or samast vaataavaran ahlad se ot-prot he
 Shakespeare was introduced to certain upper-class families and the kind of life he saw in them is published in these plays
 du:khant naatakon main maanav jivan kii gambhir samasyaon par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 The aristocratic protagonists of these plays become victims of torture and destruction after being on the road to success and progress for some time
 unke du:kha or mrityu ke kya kaaran hai, is vishay par shakespeare kaa mat spasht rup se abhivyakt hua he
 The misfortune of the protagonist is partly derived from unfavorable destiny and circumstances, but a much bigger reason is found in his character weakness
 pracheen unani dukhaant naatakon main nayak keval trutipurna nirnay athwa trutipurna drushtikon ke kaaran vinasht hota tha parantu, kadachit isai dharm or naitikwaad se prabhavit hokar, shakespeare ne apane naatakon main nayak ke patan kii pradhan jimmedaari uski charitrik durbalata par hi rakhi he
 Hamlet, Athelo, Lear and Macbeth - all of them find such a deficiency in their nature or character that causes their suffering and death
 in du:khant naatakon main duhara dwandv parilakshith hua he, aantarik dwandv ev bahya dwandv
 Internal conflict arises in the mind of the hero, in his thoughts and feelings and due to his intensity not only makes decisions difficult but also distracts the hero's principle for some time
 is prakaar ke aantarik dwandv ke kaaran naatakon main manovaigyanik sookshmata or rochakata kaa aavirbhaav hua he
 External conflict arises from the competition of external powers and their struggle, such as mutual opposition of two opposing political parties or armies
 shakespeare ke pramukh du:khant naatakon main raktagat evam bhayaavah drishyon kii avatarana ke kaaran atyant aatankapurna vaataavaran nirmit hua he
 Likewise, the incorporation of murder and vengeance scenes also deepened the process of depression
 in sabhi visheshtaon or upkarnon ko shakespeare ne katipay puraane naatakon tathaa seneka, kid, marlo aadi naatakakaron se grahan kiya tha or samayik lokaruchi ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi unka upyog apane naatakon main kiya tha
 The features of the grief dramas we have mentioned here are found not only in Hamlet, Athelo, King Lear, and Macbeth, but also partly in the grief plays based on Romeo and Juliet and the history of England and Rome
 Huh
 shakespeare ne jin aitihaasik naatakon kii rachana kii unamem kai roman itihaas vishyak hai
 In the writings of these Roman plays, Shakespeare has altered the facts of history quite a bit, and at some sites it appears that the portrait of life presented is not of ancient Rome but of Elizaveth England
 itnaa hone par bhi ye naatak sadaiv lokapriy rahe hai, visheshkar julius sijar tathaa antony and cleopatra
 Antoine Aid Cleopatra is full of poetic passages and the characterization of Cleopatra is extremely effective
 timen ov athens or pericules main unani itihaas kii ghatnaon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Among the plays based on English history, there are some that are written only partially by Shakespeare, but both Henry IV and Henry v are penned by Shakespeare
 in teenon naatakon main kavi ko mahan safalataa mili he
 They have a very attractive rendition of valor and honor and Falstaff's character is very interesting and charming
 richard tritiy or richard dwitiya main marlo kaa anukaran safaltaapurvak kiya gaya he
 Most English historical plays prior to Shakespeare contained inanimate depictions of facts and events, and they were monotonous due to blank history
 shakespeare ne is prakaar ke naatakon ko jeevant rup dekar chamatkaarpurn bana diya he
 Shakespeare's mature biography is found in the final plays
 mahakavi ko apane jivan main vibhinn prakaar ke anubhav hue the jinaki jhalak uni kritiyon main dikhaai padati he
 There is imagination in the pleasing plays of love, and the poet's mind is rich in luxury and youth
 du:khant naatakon main aise du:khad anubhavon ko abhivyakti he jo jivan ko vishakt bana dete hai
 Shakespeare's work has resulted in the creation of plays that have resulted in his perfect intelligence
 kavi ab apni vivekpurna drushti se dekhtaa he ki jivan main sukh or du:kha donon sannivisht rahete hai, at: daanon hi kshanik hai
 Both are embedded in grief in life, so both are transient
 jivan main du:kha ke baad sukh aata he, atev vichaar or vyavhaar main samatv vaanchhneeya he
 These final plays lead to the conclusion that mercy and forgiveness are more invulnerable than violence and vengeance
 apane gambhir naitik sandesh ke kaaran in naatakon kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Shakespeare's plays are Romantic and separate from the tradition of ancient Greek and Latin plays
 at: unamem vastuvinyas kii shastreey visheshtaon ko foondnaa uchit nahin he
 Only in his last play 'the Tempest' have he managed the three inventions
 praaia: sabhi anya naatakon main keval karyanviti kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he, samay or sthaan kii drushti se ve nitant niabandh hai
 There is always enough detail in the plot and usually many stories are embedded in it
 udaahranarth ham e mid samar nits dream, di marchent aav venice, aiz you like it athwa king lier ko le sakate hai
 In all these, a mix of many stories has done the objective work
 kintu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki shakespeare ke naatakon kii banaavat trutipurna he
 The end-of-the-story storytelling is beautifully crafted, and there is a sense of unity collected from the entire plot
 shastreey arth main anvitiyon kaa abhaav hone par bhi in svachhndathawadi naatakon main bhavanatmak tathaa kalpanaatmak ekikaran hua he
 Shakespeare has more success in characterization
 apane naatakon main unhone anek aakarshak paatro kii sristi kii he jo apane jeevant rup main hamaare saamne aate hai
 Over time the process of characterization became more and more subtle and artistic
 udhaaharan ke liye ham sukhaant naatakon main samavisht rojalin, porcia, viartras, rojalind, vyla prabhruti pragalbha naariyon ko le sakate hai jo apni prakhar buddhi or vaakchaturi kaa parichay nirantar detii hai
 The second category are those women whose unique beauty and perilous experiences lead to compassion in the mind
 es naariyon main pramukh hai juliet, ophilia, desdymona, cardilia, imozen ityadi
 Characterization is highly important in sad plays
 udhaaharan ke liye ham hamelet ko le sakate hai
 All the events of the play are centered on the character of the protagonist and the development of the narrative is effected by his personality
 anshat: yahi baat anya du:khant naatakon ke liye bhi satya he
 Many memorable characters are found in ancient Greek plays, but Shakespeare's main characters, depicted using moral and psychological devices, are far more interesting and attractive
 aantarik dwandv ke upyog se du:khant naatakon kii patrakalpana or bhi adhik chamatkaarpurn ho gai he
 Some other characters in Shakespeare's plays are also notable such as clown and villain
 vidushakon main phalstaff tochastone, feste or king lier kaa swamibhakt vidooshak aadi mahatvapurn hai
 Villains include Richard III, Iago, Edmund Iyashi, etc
 jaisaa hazlit ne likhaa he, shakespeare kii shakti kaa pataa isse lagata he ki na keval unke mahatvapurn paatro main vaishishty he varan unke bahusankhyak laghu paatr bhi apana nijee mahatv rakhte hai
 Although prose is used elsewhere in Shakespeare's plays, they are still poetic in origin
 unka adhikansh bhaag chandobaddh he
 Not only this, almost all theatrical works are full of poetic qualities
 kalpana kaa prakaashan, alankarik abhivyakti, sangitatmak lay tathaa komal bhaawanaaon ke nirupan dwaara shakespeare ne manomuguakari prabhaav utpann kar diya he
 Since ancient times, plays were considered a mere distinction of poetry and Shakespeare accepted the ancient notion
 gadhy kaa prayog yada kada vishesh prayojan se hua he
 But in general we can call Shakespeare's plays poetic
 kavyatatv shuru main atyadhik tha kintu shanai: shanai: uskaa rup sanyat ho gaya or prayojan ke vichaar se uskaa niyantran hone laga
 Likewise, there was a constant effort to incorporate Shakespeare's style; As a result, early plays have an abundance of elaborate narratives and beautiful metaphors
 His style was balanced in his mature age by the time Shakespeare was composing his famous sorrowful plays
 praathmik avasthaa main abhivyakti kaa adhik mahatv tha or vichaaron kaa kam
 But in this secondary period, there is proper coordination of ideas, expressions and means of expression
 yah santulit vyavastha antim varshon main shakespeare kaa dhyaan vichaaron or naitik pratimaanon par kendrit tha or unhone shailigat chamatkaar kii upeksha kii
 That is why the style of the final plays has gone somewhere rough
 shakespeare ne apane naatak mukhyat: rangamanch par abhinay ke liye likhe the, yadhyapi kaavyatmak gunon ke kaaran ham unase pathan dwaara bhi anand praapt karte hai
 The arrangement of the acting of the erstwhile theater, the public interest of the audience, all influenced Shakespeare's theatrical production
 do ek udhaaharan hi paryaapt honge
 At that time dyed curtains were not used, so many descriptive pieces have been included in plays
 inhen varnanon dwaara sthaan, kaal or paristhiti kaa sanket hota tha
 The continuous use of the subject and self-talk in plays was possible because the next triangular part of the theater continued to spread among the observers
 kai purush or nari paatro kaa sarjan shakespeare ne keval isliye kiya ki unke upyukt abhinayta uplabdh the
 Many scenes have been opened for the entertainment of the audience, in which exciting and entertaining situations have been performed at the theater
 aaj ke yathartwaadee rangamanch kii bhanti elizveth yugin rangamanch prachur sadhano tathaa nishchit vyavastha dwaara bandhaa hua tha
 Both the acting and the performances were relatively free, so Shakespeare's plays have enough merit
 praaia: sabhi prakaar ke naatakon main mahakavi ne gey muktakon kaa sannivesh kiya he jo apane saundarya or maadhurya ke liye anupam hai
 Apart from these, there are elaborate poems of Shakespeare, in which 'vince and Adonis', 'the Rape of Lucreis' and Sanates are required to be mentioned
 ye sabhi kritiyaan 16 veen shatabdi ke antim dashak kii hai jab shakespeare kaa man saundarya evam pranay ke prabhaav se ahladaparn ho gaya tha
 An ancient love story has been described in a very poetic manner in 'vince and Adonis'
 'di rape ov lukris' main ek param sundari roman mahila ke durbhaagya or mrityu kii katha he
 There are some in the Sannets who are related to a friend of the poet who had decided not to marry
 shakespeare ne uske rup or gunon kii charchaa karte hue usase apana nishchay badalane ke liye aagrah kiya he
 The second order of the sennets is related to a Shyamvarna woman, who had developed intense attraction in the mind of the poet, but who did not respect the affection and gave her love to the friend of the poet, keeping in mind the first order of the sennets
 shakespeare ne in saneton main apni aantarik bhaawanaaon kaa prakaashan kiya he athwa ve paramparaagat rachanaayen maatr hai, yah prashn atyant vivadagrast he
 The Sunda language is the language of the people of the western one-third of Java

 This language has a close relationship with Maduri language and Malay language but is relatively distant from Java language

 The analogy is made of analogy
 The analogy is called Analogy in English
 It is made up of Greek analogue; analogia is made up of two words Ana and logos, in which ana means the same and logos means ratio, thus the ratio or proportionality of proportions is analogia
 Therefore, the process of estimation based on similarity or analogy is called analogy or equivalence
 For example, on the basis of similarities in some things of Earth and Mars, we predict that there will probably be life on Mars
 Thus analogy is a possible inference in which a possible conclusion can be drawn based on the similarity of properties in two facts or actions

 a Chaitya is a Buddhist or Jain temple which contains a stupa
 bhartiya vaastukala se sambandhit aadhunik granthon main, shabd chaityagrih un puja yaa prarthana sthalon ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa he jahaan ek stupa upasthit hota he
 The architecture of Chaitya and the Roman design concept with pillars and arches show similarities
 chaityas, sanskrit 'chita' se vyutpann 
 This word is basically related to things related to Chita or Chita
 chita sthal par yaa mrit vyakti kii paavan raakh ke upar smriti-bhavannirmaan athwa vriksharopan kii pracheen parampara kaa ullekh brahman, buddha or jain saahitiyon main hua hai
 In the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavadgita, the term is used for the sacred altar, devasthan, prasad, religious tree, etc
 - Devasthaneshu Chaityeshu Naganamalayeshu Ch, Prasadgopur Sabhachayatideva Grihadishu, Kanchichithayatasarjushta:; Chaityaupankita Bhumaryasayeya Savanakara
 baudhon or jainon main bhikkhu yaa sanyasi ke samadhisthal par paavan smriti-bhawan-nirmaan kii parampara hi chal padi thi
 As a result, such incidents have been mentioned in their literature very often
 dhire-dhire is shabd kaa prayog stupa ke liye hone laga
 With the propagation and propagation of Buddhism, chaitya nirman entered other countries
 srilanka main iske liye 'dagaba' or tibeti main 'dungten' shabd shabd prachlit hue
 Later, the word Chaitya was also used for a holy place, temple, astipatra or sacred tree
 aadhunik puravid is shabd kaa prayog saamanyatya buddha yaa jain mandir ke liye karte hai yadhyapi buddha vaastu main ek vishisht style main nirmit us bhawan ko chaityaprasaad kaha jaataa he jisamen upasna ke liye stupa pratishthapit kiye jate the
 In this way, the same religious sentiment was at the core of the creation of the Chaityaprasadas
 fergusan kaa mat he ki bhaja, nasik, ellora, karle aadi sthanon ke buddha chaityaprasaad girjagharon ke kaaphi nikat hai
 Their composition, altar or sanctum sanctorum, pavilion, etc
 have a lot of similarity, although the construction of chaityas started long before the churches
 garbhagrih, mandap or pradakshinpath kii rachanastyli tathaa chaityaprasaad or hindu mandiron main bhi vishesh samanta pai jaati he
 The stupa set up in the semicircular part of the Chaityaprasad was the center of worship
 stupa ke parshv se pradakshinpath jaataa tha jo usase stambhon dwaara pruthak kar diya jaataa tha
 The base of the palace was circular
 apane praarambhik rup main chaityaprasaad kashthanirmit hote the jinka ullekh ramayana tathaa buddha or jain saahitiyon main saamaan rup se hua he
 In due course, inspired by the spirit of making them permanent, the creators started the whole imagination of Chaityaprasad in solid rocks
 a new world of art began to be carved into them by cutting the rocks of the standing mountains
 unke bheetar bade bade mandap, stambh, stupa, banaae jane lage
 In the articles these have been called Selghar, Chettiar, Selmundap etc
 yadhyapi prarambh main is disha main kashthanirmit chaityagrih kaa andhanukaran kiya gaya or lakdi ke aadhaaron or jodon ko bhi anaavashyak dhang se pattharon main bhi utkeern kiya gaya, jaisaa ki bhaja, konda tathaa karle ke bhavy chaityaprasaadon se spasht hai, kintu baad main us anaavashyak rachanavidhan kaa parityag kar diya gaya
 There are about 900 such Chaitya caves in the area of two hundred miles of Nashik near Bombay, Western India, which were built during the period of BC
 Between the second century and the seventh century

 Sankhya is also one of the six types of Indian philosophy which was very popular and famous in ancient times
 yah advait veydant se sarvatha vipareet manyataayen rakhane vaala darshan he
 The original person who founded it is called Kapil
 'sankhya' kaa shabdic arth he - 'sankhya sambandhi' yaa vishleshan
 Its most prominent belief is that the creation is made up of the nature man, here nature is the root and the male conscious
 yoga shastron ke urja strot, shakton ke shiv-shakti ke siddhant iske samaanaantar dikhte hai
 Sankhya philosophy once held a very high place in Indian culture
 desh ke udaatt mastishk sankhya kii vichaar paddati se sochate the
 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti festival
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 One of the reasons for its popularity has been that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by repudiating the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale sat, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat kii vishmata kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada buddhigamya prathit hota he
 By not considering any temporal problem as the law of God, the reason for deteriorating the synergy of these forms and not making effort of the creatures
 yani, sankhya darshan kii sabase badi mahanata yah he ki isamen sristi kii utpatti bhagwaan ke dwaara nahin maani gayi he balki ise ek vikasaatmak prakriya ke rup main samajha gaya he or mana gaya he ki sristi anek anek avasthaaon se hokar guzarane ke baad apane vartmaan swaroop ko praapt hui he
 Kapilacharya is considered by many to be an atheist but this notion has been denied in texts like Bhagavad Gita and Satyarthraprakash
 sankhya-darshan kaa mukhya aadhaar satkaryawad he
 According to this theory, work cannot originate without reason
 faltah, is jagat kii utpatti shunya se nahin kisi mul satta se he
 This theory is contrary to Buddhist nihilism
 kaary, apni utpatti ke purna kaaran main vidyaman rahata he
 Work is the essence of its cause
 kaary tathaa kaaran vastutah samaan prakriya ke vyakt-avyakt rup hai
 Matrimonialism has two distinctions - consequentialism and discourse
 parinamwad se taatpary he ki kaaran vaastavik rup main kaary main parivartit ho jaataa he
 Like in sesame oil, milk is converted into curd
 vivartvaad ke anusaar parivartan vaastavik na hokar abhas maatr hota he
 Like the feeling of a snake in a rope
 sankhya darshan prachinkaal main atyant lokapriy tathaa prathit hua tha
 Sankhya philosophy once held a very high place in Indian culture
 desh ke udaatt mastishk sankhya kii vichaar paddati se sochate the
 The Mahabharata has even said that if knowledge comes, then there are few numerical figures, Mahanmahatma
 vastut: mahabharat main darshanik vichaaron kii jo prishthbhumi he, usamen sankhyashastra kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 The ideas of Samkhya Darshan have been mentioned in many poetic and interesting ways at many places of Shanti Parva
 sankhya darshan kaa prabhaav gita main pratipaadit darshanik prishthbhumi par paryaapt rup se vidyaman he
 In fact, Sankhya philosophy became very popular at some time
 isaki lokapriyata ke or chaahe jo bhi kaaran hon par ek to yah avashya rahaa prathit hota he ki is darshan ne jivan main dikhaai padane vaale vaishamy kaa samaadhaan trigunatmak prakruti kii sarvakaaran rup main pratishtha karke bade sundar dhang se kiya
 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the illusions of the world on the basis of the elements of different religions, Rajas and Tamas elements, seems to be very just and wise
 "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti "sankhya" shabd ke aage anu pratyay jodne se hoti he or sankhya shabd kii vyutpatti saarchaksh dhaatu khyan darshain pratyay taap he, jiske anusaar iskaa arth samyak khyaati, sadhu darshan athwa satya gyaan he
 This due fame of the Sankhyacharyas, this true knowledge of them, lies in the separation of the male form of the Chitta element from the person's form and the dual aspect of the person
 upar-upar se prapanch main sanaa hua dikhaai padane par bhi purush vastut: usase achoota rahata he
 In spite of being seen as indulgent or indulged in it, one remains virtually unattached or uninterested - this greatest philosophical discovery of the Sankhyakaris is treated in his own words by the names Satvapurushanyakhyati, Vivek Khyati, Prakritik Vigyan, etc
 isi vivek gyaan se maanav jivan ke param purusharth yaa lakshya kii siddhi maanate hai
 Thus "number" is an abbreviation to reveal the true form of the greatest philosophical discovery of the word numerology, being the first lecturer, his ideology was named as "samkhya" in very ancient times
 gananarthak "sankhya" shabd se bhi "sankhya" shabd kii nishpatti maani jaati he
 In the Mahabharata, both these types of expressions have been revealed in a verse about Sankhya
 vah is prakaar he- sankhyan prakurvate chaiv prakrutin c prachakshate
 Tattvānti Ch Chatuvinsdān Ten Samkhya: Prakritita:
 iskaa shabdaarth yah he ki jo sankhya arthath prakruti or purush ke vivek gyaan kaa upadesh karte hai, jo prakruti kaa prabhaav pratipaadan karte hai tathaa jo tatwon kii sankhya choubees nirdhaarit karte hai, ve sankhya kahe jate hai
 Some people are of the opinion that the secondary goal of the word "number" in the form of knowledge is considered to be the attainment of Kaivalya or salvation, the ultimate goal of life from the wisdom of nature and man, hence the attainment of that knowledge is the main and For this reason, the whole force of Samkhya is on him
 sankhya choubees tatv maanata he, yah to ek saamaanya tathy kaa kathan maatr he, at: gaun he
 Udayveer Shastri in his treatise entitled "history of Samkhya Darshan" quotes the interpretation of Sridhar Swami on Bhagavata 3-25-1 in being propounded by Kapila of the Samkhya Shastra - the interpreter explaining the last verse clearly It is written - Element number numerator: Sankhya-promoter Ityarth:
 isse nishchit ho jaataa he ki yahi kapil sankhya kaa prarvatak yaa praneta he
 Scribe of Sridhar Swami: On the word, Shastri ji has written in the footnote given below - Some interpreters of the medieval period have interpreted the word "sankhya" in the term "sankhya" as calculative
 vastut: iskaa arth tatv gyaan he
 But considering it deeply, it is not as common or secondary as it seems to be an emergency
 aisa prathit hota he ki bahut pracheen kaal main darshanik vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaa main jab tatwon kii sankhya nishchit nahin ho pai thi, tab sankhya ne sarvapratham is drishyman bhautik jagat kii sookshm mimasaa kaa prayaas kiya tha jiske falswaroop uske mul main vartmaan tatwon kii sankhya saamanyat: choubees nirdhaarit kii thi
 In these also the first element which he named "prakriti" or "pradhan" was proved to be the origin of the remaining twenty three
 chit purush ke saannnidhya se isi ek tatv "prakruti" ko kramash: taees avaantar tatwon main parinat hokar samast jad jagat ko utpann karti hui mana tha
 Thus behind the determination of element number, there seems to be a huge intellectual practice of statistics
 aakhir sookshm buddhi ke dwaara deergh kaal tak bina chintan or vishleshan kiye tatwon kii sankhya kaa nirdhaaran kaise sambhav hua hoga? From the above discussion, it is decided that the "sankhya" name of Sankhya philosophy is indicative of its rational argument with both types
 sankhyon kaa achit prakruti tathaa chit purush, donon hi moolbhoot tatwon ko aagam yaa shruti pramaan se siddh maanate hue bhi mukhyat: anumaan pramaan ke aadhaar par siddh karnaa bhi isi baat kaa parichaayak he
 It is clear from the view of both the Samkhya discourse formulas and the numeric texts available these days that it is proved by the inference based on both the fundamental elements of Samkhya - nature and power of man
 purush kii anekta main bhi yuktiyaan hi di gai hai
 Satirism has also been established on the basis of arguments
 
 Thus the Sravana scripture, which is the foundation of wisdom knowledge, is logic-oriented
 manan, anukaal tarkon dwaara shastrokt tathyon tathaa siddhanton kaa chintan he hi
 Thus, the number or wisdom due to which the Sankhya philosophy got its "sankhya" name has a special relationship with logic and intellectualism
 is buddhivaad ke kaaran avaantar kaal main sankhya darshan ke kuch siddhant vaidic sampradaay se bahut kuch swatantra rup se viksit hue jiske kaaran baadaraayan vyas tathaa shankaracharya aadi aacharyon ne iskaa khandan karte hue avaidic sampradaay, tak kah daalaa
 This sect does not appear to be non-vedic in its origin and in its latter form is also not completely vedic
 prasiddh bhashyakaar vigyanbhikshu ne bhi sankhya ko aagam yaa shruti kaa sat tarkon dwaara kiya jane vaala manan hi mana he
 He has said the same thing in his Sankhya discourse-sutra-annotation of the commentary - "vedic scripture", which removes all the campaign of male-related Vedic word, to free it and free the man from all kinds of cosmic forms
 It is said that the narrator Narayanavatar Bhagwan Kapil was born to preach the Sad tips required for contemplating the meaning of those Vedas
 vigyaan bhikshu ke purv pravachanon se spasht he ki ve sankhya shaastra ko vedanusaari maanate hai
 He is clear that he supports the meaning of the Vedic verses "ekvidiyyah", etc
 through Sad tips and arguments, rendering and deliberating it makes it understandable
 vigyanbhikshu ne vastut: lok main prachlit purv parampara kaa hi anusaran karte hue apana purvokt mat prakat kiya he
 Since the very ancient times, in the Mahabharata, Gita, Ramayana, Smriti and Puranas, not only is there a mention of the Sankhya as a high knowledge, but there is also a detailed description of its principles
 gita main bhi sankhya darshan ke trigunatmak siddhant ko badi sundar reeti se apanaaya gaya he
 "trigunatmika Prakriti is the continual resultant
 uske teenon gun hi sadaa kuch na kuch parinaam utpann karte rahete hai, purush akarta he" -sankhya kaa yah siddhant gita ke nishkaam karmyog kaa aavashyak ang ban gaya he 
 Similarly elsewhere, many theories of Samkhya philosophy are visible in the ancient Sanskrit Vadmay, complementing the principles of other philosophies
 in sab baton se aisa prathit hota he ki yah darshan apane mul main vaidic hi rahaa he, avaidic nahin, kyonki yadi satya isse vipareet hota to vedapraan is desh main sankhya ke itane adhik prachaar-prasar ke liye uparyukt kshetra na miltaa
 Vedanta commentator Shankaracharya, who refuted it as Vedah due to the so-called Vedas against the principles of Atheism, Prakriti dualism, consequentialism, etc
, also had to write in the commentary of Brahmasutra 2
1
3 that "even after having many spiritual memories, the Sankhya Yoga memories only Attempt was made in disposal
 kyonki ye donon lok main param purusharth ke saadhan rup main prasiddh hai, shisht mahapurushon dwaara gruhit hai tathaa "tatkaarann sankhya yogabhishanna gyatva devam muchyate sarvapashai: yaa ityadi shrot lingon se yukt hai
 "it is also clear from the evidence of the commentator himself that even during the time of his predecessor Sutrakara, many elegant men considered Sankhya philosophy as Vedic philosophy and followed it as a means of ultimate effort
 in sab tathyon ke aadhaar par sankhya darshan ko mulat: vaidic hi maananaa samichin he
 Yes, in its later development it must have gone against the Vedas in some fundamental principles like the latter is nirvishvara against the Sankhya Vedic tradition, its nature independently creates the entire world
 parantu is darshan kaa mul pracheenatam chhandogya evam vrihadaaranyak upanishdon main praapt hota he
 Its antiquity is evident from this
 is darshan ke do hi moulik granth aaj uplabdh hai- pehla chah adhyyon vaala "sankhya-pravachan-sutara" or doosraa sattar karikaon vaala "sankhyakarika"
 Apart from these two, there is also a very small sutra script which is famous as "tattva Samas"
 shesh samast sankhya vadmay inhen teenon kii tikaa or upatika maatr he
 Among them, Kapil is considered to be from the Upadesha tradition of Sankhya Sutras
 kai kaarnon se uplabdh sankhya-pravachan-sutron ko vidwaan log kapilkrit nahin maanate
 It is definitely certain that even considering these sources as Kapilopotip, many of its sites will have to be projected on the strength of the inter-target of the sources themselves
 sankhyakarikas, ishwarkrishna dwaara rachit hai, jinka samay bahumat se i
 tritiy shatabdi kaa madhya mana jaataa he
 In fact, their time seems to be long before this
 kapil ke shishy asuri kaa koi granth nahin bataaya jaataa, parantu inke prathit shishy acharya panchasikh ke naam se anek sutron ke vyasakrut yogabhashya aadi pracheen granthon main uddhrut hone se spasht prathit hota he ki inke dwaara rachit koi sutaragranth ati pracheen kaal main prasiddh tha
 By the opinion of many scholars, this famous book was Shashistantra
 udaiveer shastri ke mat se vartmaan kaal main uplabdh shadadhyaai sankhya-pravachan-sutara hi shashthi padaarthon kaa nirupan karne ke kaaran "shashthitantr" ke naam se bhi gyaat tha
 By his opinion, probably Panch Shikhacharya of Kapil Muni had written an explanation on it and that too was called Shashtantra in the name of the original text
 kuch vidwaanon ke mat se "shashthi tantra" prasiddh sankhyacharya varshganya kaa likhaa hua he
 Today there is no special knowledge about many other ancient figures like Jagishdhya, Deval, Asit etc
 prishth rasayan sataha yaa antaraprishth par hone vaali parighatnaon se sabandhit kshetra he
 a hyphen or slash is used to distinguish the interface or surface from the macro phases
 udaahranarth, ek thos evam gas ke bich antaraprishth ko, thos-gas yaa thos / gas dwaara darshaya jaataa he
 There is no interface between the gases due to complete combinability
 prishth rasayan main ham jin sthool pravasthaon ke sampark main aate hai ve shuddh yogic yaa vilyan ho sakate hai
 The thickness of the interface is often limited to a few molecules, but its area depends on the size of the particles in the macro phases
 vahut-si dhyaan dene yogya mahatvapurn paridhatnaayen jaise sanksharan, elevatrode prakram, vishmangi utpreran, vilinikaran evam crystalokaran, antaraprishth par parilakshith hoti hai
 The subject of Page Chemistry knows many applications in industry, analysis work and daily life situations
 prishth adhyayanon ko satarkatapurvak nishpadit karne hetu prishth kaa vastut: svachh hona atiavashyak he
 It is possible to get extremely clean pages of metals nowadays in a very high grade vacuum
 aise svachh sataha vaale thos padaarthon ko nirvaat main hi bhandaarit karnaa chahie anyathaa unka prishth, vaayu ke pramukh avyavon arthath dinitrogen evam dioxigen ke anuon se aachhadit ho jayega

 Adsorbent: The substance on which particles of any other substance join
 us padaarth ko adhishoshak padaarth kehete he 
 There are many examples which demonstrate that the tendency of the surface of a solid is to attract and hold atoms of contact phase
 yah anu keval prishth par hi rahete he evam sthool main gaharaai par nahin jate
 Accumulation of anorexes rather than a solid or physical body is called adsorption
 anuk spishiz yaa padaarth jo ki prishth yar sandrit yaa sanchit hota he adhishoshya kehalaata he evam padaarth jiske prishth par adhishoshan hota he, adhishoshak kehalaata he
 Adsorption is definitely a surface phenomenon
 vishesh rup se baarik churna avasthaa main thos, jo adhik prishth kshetrafal ke hote hai, jaise charcol, silica jail, alumina jail, mitti, coloid sookshm vibhajit dhaatuen ityadi achche avasorak kaa kaary karte hai
 If several gases are taken in a closed vessel containing powdered charcoal, it is seen that the pressure of the gas in the vessel decreases
 gas ke anu charcol kii sataha par sandrit ho jate he arthath gaisen sataha par adhishoshit ho jaati hai
 In a organic dye such as a methylene blue solution, when the solution is stirred well by adding organic charcoal, the color becomes colorless as the molecules of the dye collect the charcoal on the surface, ie, are absorbed
 aprishkrut sharkara ke jaleey vilyan ko jab jautav charcol ko paraton yar se pravaahit kiya jaataa he to yah rangahin ho jaataa he; kyonki rangeen padaarth charcol dwaara adhishoshit kar liye jate hai
 Air becomes dry in the presence of silica gels, as water molecules absorb on the surface of the gel
 uparokt udaahranon se yah spasht he ki thos prishth gas yaa drav ke anuon ko adhishoshan ke kaaran bandhe rakhti hai
 Removal of any under-absorbed material from the page on which it is under-exploited is called dissolution
 adhishoshan ko utpatti is tathy se hoti he ki adhishoshak ke prishthiya kan vaise vaataavaran main nahin hote jisamen sthool ke andar ke kan hote hai
 All the forces on the particles inside the adsorbent are balanced among themselves but the dorsal particles are not surrounded by atoms or molecules of their type in all directions, so they have unbalanced or surplus attraction forces
 adhishoshak ke ye bal hi adhishoshak kanon ko aakarshith karne ke liye uttaradaayi hote hain
 The limit of adsorption at a given temperature and pressure increases as the area of mass per unit of adsorbent increases
 doosraa mahatvapurn kaarak jo adhishoshan kii visheshta chitrit karata he, vah he adhishoshan ooshmaa
 Residual forces on the surface are always reduced when adsorption occurs, ie there is a decrease in surface energy which manifests as heat
 at: adhishoshan sadaa ek ooshmakshepi prakram hota he
 In other words, there is always a negative change in the enthalpy of adsorption
 jab ek gas adhishoshit hoti he, to iske anuon kaa sanchalan simit ho jaataa he
 This reduces gas entropy after adsorption
 arthath entropi main rinatmak parivartan hota he
 Thus the entropy and thermal capacitance of the body decrease when adsorption occurs
 kisi prakram ke swat: pravartit hone ke liye, ooshmagatirkaay aavashyaktaa yah he ki sthir taap evam daab par gibs urja ke kshetra main rinatmak parivartan donna chahie arthath gibs urja main kami honi chahie
 There are two types of adsorption of gases on solids
 yadi kisi thos ke prishth par gans kaa sanchayan durbal vanderwalas balon ke kaaran hota he to adhishoshan ko bhautik athishoshan kehete hai
 When gas molecules or atoms join chemical bonds on a solid surface, adsorption is called chemical adsorption
 rasinic bandha prakruti main sahasanyojak yaa ynic do sakate hai
 Chemical adsorption involves high activation energy, so it is usually referred to as active adsorption
 kabhi-kabhi ye donon prakram saath-saath hote he evam adhishoshan kaa prakaar nishchit karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 Physical adsorption at low temperature increases into heat absorption
 udhaaharan ke liye, diahydrogen pehle nickel ko sataha par vanderwalas baston ke dwaara adhishoshit hoti he
 The hydrogen molecules are then dissociated into atoms, which bind the nickel to the surface by scavenging
 vishistataa kii kami - ek adhishoshak kii do gai sataha kisi vishisht gas ke liye koi praathamikta nahin darshaati kyoki vanderwalas bal vyapak haute hai
 Nature of majority - The amount of gas absorbed by a solid depends on the nature of the gas
 saamanyatya, saraltapurvak dravniy gaisen aasaani se adhishoshit ho jaati hai, kyunki vanderwalas bal kranthik tapon ke nikat adhik prabal hote hai
 That is why one gram of activated charcoal overpresents sulfur dianvides more than methane, which is more than four and a half ml - uihainhogen
 utkamarnaay prakruti - gans kaa thos par adhishoshan samanyaaya utkamaniya hota he
 Hence solid + gas = gas / solid + energy daab badhaane par adhik gans adhishoshit hoti he kyoki isse gas kaa aaytan kam hota he or daab ghataakar gas ko nikaala ja saktaa he
 The adsorption process is due to exothermic, physical adsorption takes place easily at low temperatures and the heat increases decreases
 adhishoshak kaa prishthiya kshetrafal - adhishoshan kaa pariman adhishoshak ke prishthiya kshetrafal ke badhane ke saath badhata he
 Therefore, finely powdered metals and porous materials which have high surface area are good adsorbents
 adhishoshan kii anthalpi - nisandeh, bhautik adhikansh ek ooshmakshepi prakram he parantu adhishoshan kii edruthalmi, atyadhik kam hoti he
 This is because the attraction between the gaseous molecules and the solid surface is due only to weak wanderwallous forces
 uchv vishistataa - rasovasoshana ativishisht hota he evam yah keval tabhi hota hai jab adhishoshak evam adhishoshya ke madhya rasinic bandha banane kaa koi sambhaavna do
 For example, oxygen is absorbed by the formation of oxides on metals and the transition of hydrogen is due to absorption of metals by the formation of dehydrides
 anutkamarnyta - rasovasoshana main yogic banane ke kaaran isko prakruti anutkamaniya hoti he
 Chest absorption is also an exothermic process but due to the high activation energy it is very slow at low temperatures
 adhikansh rasinic parivartanon ke samaan adhishoshan taap badhane par praaia: badhata he
 The physical adsorption of gas at low temperatures can result in scouring at high temperatures
 saadharantaya ucch daab bhi rasovasoshana ke liye sahaayak hota he
 Mushroom area - Similar to the physical superposition, the bromboid also increases when the surface area of the adsorbent increases
 adhishoshan kii anthalpi - rasovasoshana kii anthalpi ucch hoti he kyonki isamen rasinic bandha kaa nirmaan hota he
 In adsorption, the substance is only concentrated on the surface and does not enter the bulk from the surface of the adsorbent, while in absorption the substance is distributed evenly throughout the mass of the solid
 udhaaharan ke liye jab ek chaak ko syaahi main duboya jaataa he to chaak kii sataha ranjak anuon ke adhishoshan ke kaaran syaahi kaa rang dhaaran kar leti he
 Only the solvent of the ink goes inside the chalk due to absorption
 chaak ko todane par yah andar se safed nikalati he
 The example of water vapor can be differentiated into adsorption and absorption
 jal vaashp shushk calcium chloride ke dwaara avashoshit hoti he jabaki silica jail dwaara adhishoshit hoti he
 In other words, the concentration of the surplus in adsorption only increases on the surface of the adsorbent while the concentration in the absorbance remains uniform throughout the bulk of the solid

 Vasudha then tells Aarav to save Hari
 aarav mukhyamantri se mil kar jaanata he kii usne swayan hi gunaah kabuula he
 Vasudha refuses to marry Aarav
 use lagata he kii hari bekasoor he
 He goes to Bastar and discovers evidence of Hari being innocent
 vah dayaal se miltaa he
 Who calls Hari innocent
 uske baad vah mumbai waapas laut jaataa he
 Aarav smells the smell of the same flower that he smelled on the day he met Vasudha
 vasudha aarav ke maut kii khabar sunati he
 Vasudha leaves Hari, who keeps searching for her for two years
 uske baad vartmaan main yah pataa chalata he kii bas main jo thi vah vasudha he or vah aarav ke paas jaati he
 Where he died
 aakhri main hari vasudha ke raakh ko bastar ke jangalon main phek detaa he

 siddhant rup se, koi bhi vastu jo dhwani paidaa karti he, vaadya yantra kahi ja sakati he
 The history of instruments begins at the beginning of human culture
 vaadyayantra kaa shaikshanik adhyayan, angrezi main orgenology kehalaata he
 Music composed using only instrumental music is called instrumental music
 sangeet vaadya ke rup main ek vivaadit yantra kii tithi or utpatti 67,000 saal puraani maani jaati he; kalakritiyaan jinhen saamanytah praarambhik bansuri mana jaataa he kareeb 37,000 saal puraani hai
 However, most historians believe that it is impossible to determine a specific time of the invention of the instrument, being subjective to the definition

 kuch khojein 67,000 saal tak puraani hai, lekin vaadyayantra ke rup main unki haisiyat par aksar vivaad rahaa he
 Unanimously, a verdict was given about artifacts dating back to 37,000 years old or later
 sirf waisi kalakritiyaan bachi hui hai jo tikaoo saamagree yaa tikaoo tareekon kaa upyog karke banaai gai hai
 Thus, the samples discovered cannot be undisputedly considered the earliest instruments
 july 1995 main, slovenian puratatvavid evan turk ne slovenia ke uttar pashchimi kshetra main ek nakkashidaar haddi kii khoj kii
 The object, named Divje Babe Flute, has four holes that, Canadian music scientist Bob Fink believes, may have been used to play four notes of a diatonic scale

 However, some archaeologists have questioned the status of this flute as an instrument
 german puratatvavidon ne swabian alb main 30,000 se 37,000 saal puraani maimath kii haddi or hans kii haddi kii bansuri ko khoja he
 These flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic period and are more commonly accepted as the oldest known musical instruments

 The tomb to which these instruments belonged was dated to carbon dating between 2600 and 2500 BCE, providing evidence that these instruments were being used in Sumeria by this time
 mesopotamia main nippur se praapt, 2000 BCE puraane keelakaar tablet par lahore ke taron ke naam ingit hai or yah swarlipi kaa sabase pracheen gyaat udhaaharan he
 Scholars agree that there is no completely reliable way of determining the exact chronology of instruments in different cultures
 unki jatilta ke aadhaar par vaadyayantron kii tulana or unka aayojan bhraamak he, chunki vaadyayantron main hone vaale vikaas ne kabhi-kabhi jatilta ko kam kiya he
 For example, the construction of early slit drums involved harvesting and hollowing out huge trees; Later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stems, which was quite easy
 isi prakaar kaarigari ke aadhaar par vaadyayantra ke vikaas ko yojit karnaa bhraamak he, chunki sabhi samskritiyaan vibhinn staron par vikaas karti hai or unhen alag-alag samagriyaan uplabdh hoti hai
 For example, anthropologists attempting to compare instruments created by two cultures that existed at the same time, which differed in their formation, culture, and handicraft, could not determine which instruments were more "primitive"
 bhugol ke aadhaar par yantron ko kramit karnaa bhi aanshik rup se avishwasaneey he, kyonki koi yah nirdhaarit nahin kar saktaa ki kab or kaise samskritiyon ne ek duusare se sampark kiya or aapas main gyaan saajha kiya
 The German music scientist, Kurt Sax, who is the most prominent music scientist and anthropologist of modern times, suggests that a geographical chronology dating to about 1400 is better, as it is limited subjectively
 1400 ke upar, samyavadhi ke aadhaar par vaadyayantra ke samgr vikaas ko liya ja saktaa he
 The science of marking the sequence of development of instruments is dependent on archaeological crafts, artistic notation and literary references
 chunki kisi ek anusandhan maarg main aankade adhure ho sakate hai, sabhi teen maarg ek behatar aitihaasik tasviir uplabdh karaate hai
 European music history, written until the 19th century, begins with these mythological descriptions of how instruments were invented
 aise vivaranon main shaamil he jubaal, can ke vanshaj or "un sabhi kaa pita jo harp or organ sambhalate hai", paan, panpipe ke avishkaarak or marakari, kaha jaataa he jisane kachhue ke sookhe khol se pehla lahore banaaya tha
 Modern history has replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation and is sometimes corroborated by archaeological evidence
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki vaadyayantra kaa koi nishchit "avishkaar" nahin kiya gaya, chunki "vaadya yantra" shabd kii paribhaasha vidwaan or bhavi-avishkaarak, donon ke liye puri tarah se vyaktiparak he
 For example, a Homo Habilis slapping his body could be an under-construction instrument regardless of its intent
 maanav sharir se pare jin upkarnon ko pratham vaadyayantra mana jaataa he, ve hai jhunjhune, stamper or vibhinn prakaar ke drum

 The early cultures for which drums developed ritualistic and even sacred significance are the Chukchi people of Far Eastern Russia, the native people of Melanisia, and many cultures in Africa
 In fact, in every African culture, drums were widely present
 ek purvi africa janajati, vahinda ise itnaa pavitra maanati thi ki sultan ke alaava ise dekhne vaale kisi anya vyakti ke liye yah ghaatak hota tha
 Eventually humans developed the concept of using instruments to produce melodies
 vaadyayantra ke vikaas main is samay tak, raag, sirf gayan main hi aam tha
 Similar to the process of repetition in language, instrumentalists first developed repetition and then instrumentalization
 An early form of melody was produced by banging a tube of two different sizes - one tube produced a "clear" sound and the other produced a "deep" sound
 aise yantron ke jode main bullrorer, slit drum, sip turahiyaan or khaal drum bhi shaamil he
 Cultures that used pairs of these instruments linked gender with them; The "father" was a larger or more energetic device, while the "mother" was a smaller or slower device

 Despite this development, very few instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia main vaadyayantron ke praarambhik itihaas ko phir se sangathit karne ke liye vidwaanon ko sumerion yaa acadian main likhi kalakritiyon or keelakaar lekh par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Even the process of naming these devices is challenging since there is no clear distinction between the various tools and the words used to define them
