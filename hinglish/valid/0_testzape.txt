 naagarikta ke tyaag ko naagarikta adhinium 1955 kii dhara 8 ke tahat cover kiya jaataa he
 If an adult declares his renunciation of Indian citizenship, he loses Indian citizenship
 iske alaava tyaag kii dinaank se hi aise vyakti kaa avyask baccha bhi bhartiya naagarikta kho detaa he

 bhartiya naagarikta kanoon ke tahat tyaag kii ghoshnaa ke liye aavashyak he ki ghoshnaa karne vaala vyakti "purna aayu or kshamta se yukt" ho
 Termination of citizenship is covered in section 9 of the Citizenship Act 1955
 samaapti ke liye praavdhaan alag hai or tyaag kii ghoshnaa ke praavdhaan se vibhedit hai
 According to Section 9 of the Act, any citizen of India who by registration or equation acquires citizenship of another country, his Indian citizenship will be revoked
 It also provides that any citizen of India who voluntarily acquires citizenship of another country, his Indian citizenship will be revoked
 In particular, the termination provision is different from the provision of renunciation, because it is "india's Applies to any citizen "and is not restricted to adults only

 "once again, this rule applies if a foreign passport has been obtained for the child by his parents and whether it is necessary to obtain such passport according to the laws of any other country, which the child must become a citizen of his own
 Believes

 It is a form of Indian nationality, the holder of which is called a foreign national of India
 bhartiya samvidhan dohari naagarikta athwa dohari rashtriyata ko asweekaar karata he, avyask is drushti se apwaad hai jahaan duusari naagarikta anayas hi praapt ho jaati he
 Indian authorities have interpreted the law that a person cannot hold a passport from another country if he has an Indian passport - even in the case of a child who is claimed to be his citizen by another country and such It may be that the laws of that country require that child's passport to travel abroad - and Indian courts have given the car Binding branch has wide discretion
 isliye, bharat kii videshi naagarikta bharat kii purna naagarikta nahin he or is prakaar se yah dohari naagarikta yaa dohari rashtriyata ko asweekaar karata he
 The Central Government of India can, on application, register a person as a foreign national of India if the person is of Indian origin and is from a country that allows dual citizenship in one form or another
 vyapak rup se kaha jaye to "bhartiya mul kaa ek vyakti" kisi anya desh kaa naagarik he jo: Note that children of Indian parents do not automatically fulfill these requirements and are therefore not automatically eligible for OCI

 bharat kaa ek videshi naagarik samta ke aadhaar par gaiyr-pravasi bharatiyon ke liye uplabdh sabhi adhikaron or visheshadhikaron kaa laabh uthaa saktaa he

 With this, a foreign national of India can visit the country anytime, for any purpose, for any time period

saath hi bharat ke videshi naagarik bhitari rekha ke permit ke liye paatr nahin hai, agar ve bharat ke kuch vishesh sthanon kii yatra karnaa chaahate hai to unhen unhen ek sangrakshit kshetra permit ke liye aavedan dena hoga
 An interesting question is that a person registered as a foreign national of India will lose the right to diplomatic protection of his country while living in India
 Article 4 of the Hague Convention on specific questions related to the conflict of nationality law of 1930 states that " a state cannot provide diplomatic protection to a person against a state whose nationality is also held by such persons
 Depends on the subjects: First, whether the Government of India considers the foreign citizenship of India as true citizenship and on this basis the right of diplomatic protection by another country ceases; and second, whether the individual's own country recognizes it and Accepts India's rejection
 donon hi bindu sandigdh hai
 India does not provide an independent travel document to foreign nationals but instead places a visa in another country's passport
 yadi vyakti keval duusare desh kaa passport rakhane ke liye paatr he parantu bhartiya yatra dastavej ke kisi bhi rup ko nahin rakh saktaa, to is nishkarsh se batch paanaa mushkil he ki vah vyakti rajanyik sangrakshan ke prayojan ke liye anya desh kaa ekmaatr naagarik he
 On obtaining foreign citizenship of India, British citizens cannot register as full British citizens under Section 4B of the British Nationality Act of 1981
 This does not prevent them from obtaining full British citizenship in a different way and it does not revoke their British citizenship if they are already registered under Section 4B

 [[category: Hinduism operent condishning vyavhaar ke prati samvedansheel he, yaa uske parinaamon ke dwaara niyantrit he, jisamen ek seekhney kii prakriya he
 For example, a child can learn to avoid touching a hot stove or to open a box to get candy inside
 In contrast, classical conditioning causes a motivation to signal a positive or negative outcome; The resulting behavior does not produce the result
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek rangeen aavaran kii drushti se ek bachche kaa raal nikaalnaa yaa ek darwaja slam kii aawaaj se ek bachche kaa kaanpana,jis se gusse main mata pita sanket karte he
 Sometimes played an important role in learning conditioning, first studied by Edward L
 Thorndick, who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from the largely homemade puzzle boxes
 ek billi is tarah ke ek rassi khinch yaa ek pole dhakelne ke rup main ek saral pratikriya se box se batch saktaa he, lekin pehali baar vivash jab billiyon baahar nikalne ke liye ek lanbaa samay laga
 
 baar-baar pareekshan ke saath aprabhavi pratikriyaaon kam baar hua or safal pratikriyaaon adhik baar hua he, to billiyon adhik se adhik teji se bhaag nikle
 Thorndick generalizes this conclusion in his law of influence which states that behaviors followed by satisfactory results become repetitive and that those producing unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated
 sankshep main, kuch parinaam vyavhaar ko majboot banane or kuch parinaam vyavhaar kamjor
 Thorndick of plotting the escape time against test number produced curves by learning the first known animal through this process
 maanav ab condishning bulaayaa thorandic dwaara adhyayan prakriya kii tarah he, jiske madhyam se kai saral vyavhaar ko jaanane ke liye dikhaai dete hai
 They produce adverse effects when they are not, or when reactions are retained and discarded, when they lead to a successful outcome
 yah aamtaur par kisi bhi " shikshak" dwaara yojana banaai ja rahi bina hota he, lekin condishning hajaaron saal ke liye apane bacchon ko padhaane main mata-pita dwaara istemaal kiya gaya he| Skinner is often known as the father of conditioning skinner ke kriyaprasut anukulan siddhant ke anusaar, vyavhaar ke parinaam, kriya ke hone kii sambhaavna ko prabhavit karte hai
 a behavior after which a soothing stimulus is associated is more likely to occur repeatedly, but it is less likely to occur if the other behavior is associated with a punitive stimulus
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek balak ke kisi vyavhaar ko agar ek muskaraahat dwaara pratikriya di jaae to us balak dwaara vah vyavhaar punah karne kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 But if there is an angry response to such behavior, then the chances of showing that behavior again are reduced
 udhaaharan ke liye, skinner ke anusaar ek bachche ke andar uske vaataavaran main upasthit anubhavon ke aadhaar par sharmaane kaa vyavhaar viksit ho saktaa he agar vaataavaran ko punah sthapit kar diya jaae to baccha saamaajik taur par kushal ho saktaa he
 According to Skinner, rewards and punishments shape a person's development

 braille paddati ek tarah kii lipi he, jisko vishwa bhar main netraheenon ko padhane or likhane main chhukar vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 This method was invented in 1821 by Louis Braille, a blind French writer
 yah alag-alag aksharon, sankhyaon or viraam chinhon ko darshaate hai
 When Braille was blind, his father got him admitted to the Royal National Institute for the Blind Children's in Paris
 us skool main "velantin hou" dwaara banaai gai lipi se padhai hoti thi, par yah lipi adhuri thi
 Once in this school, Captain Charles Barbier, an officer of the French army, came for a training and gave a lecture about the "night Writing" or "sonography" script read by the soldiers in the dark
 yah lipi kaagaj par aksharon ko ubharkar banaai jaati thi or isamen 12 binduon ko 6-6 kii do panktiyon ko rakhaa jaataa tha, par isamen viraam chihn, sankhya, ganitiya chihn aadi nahin hote the
 Braille got this idea from Waheem
 lui ne isi lipi par aadhaarit kintu 12 ke sthaan par 6 binduon ke upyog se 64 akshar or chihn vaali lipi banaayi
 Not only punctuation marks but also mathematical symbols and musical notations could be written in it
 yahi lipi aaj sarvamaanya he
 Louis was just 15 when he composed the script
 san 1824 main purna hui yah lipi duniya ke lagbhag sabhi deshon main upyog main laai jaati he
 There are 6 dots in each rectangular cell, which are slightly raised
 yah do panktiyon main bani hoti hai
 Different 64 characters can be made in this size
 cell kii bai pankti main upar se neeche 1,2,3 bane hote hai
 Similarly, 4,5,6 are made on the right side

 It has a special technique of reading
 braille lipi ko padhane ke liye andhe bacchon main itnaa gyaan hona aavashyak he ki wo apni ungali ko vibhinn dishaao main cell par ghuma saken
 By the way, there is no standard way of reading it around the world
 braille lipi ko slate par bhi prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Apart from this it can also be presented on Braille typewriter
 aadhunik braille script ko 8 dots ke cell main viksit kar diya gaya he, taaki andhe logon ko adhik se adhik shabdon ko padhane kii suvidha uplabdh ho sake
 The Braille script cell with eight dots now has the ability to read 256 characters, numbers and punctuation marks instead of 64
 braille paddati ko varnmaala ke varnon ko kuta rup main nirupit karne vaali sabase pratham prachlit pranali kah sakate hai, kintu braille lipi netraheenon ke padhane or likh sakane ke upaay kaa pratham prayaas adhyay nahin he
 Even before this, in the 17th century, Jesuit Francisco Lana of Italy made a lot of efforts to write and read for the blind
 braille lekhan ko panne par kuch nukile staylas dwaara peeche se aage ko ubhare hue nishaan dwaara dots ko ankit kar likhaa ja saktaa he
 In such a situation it can be written by looking at the image in the mirror to write behind the page, because it is difficult to write inversely

 It can also be printed by Braille embosser attached to the computer
 braille ko braille ambosar par likhane hetu 8-bindu paddati main adyatit kiya gaya he
 In it, some additional points have been added down to the old style
 ab ye 4 bindu ooncha or 2 bindu chaudaa ho gaya he
 The additional points are numbered 7 and 8
 8-bindu code kaa ek laabh ye bhi he ki ek akshar kaa cese sidhe akshar vaali cell main diya jaataa he evam sabhi print hone vaale aski kairactors ek hi cell main likhe ja sakate hai
 All 256 combinations possible by 8-dots are possible in the Unicode standard
 6-bindu vaali braille lipi ko braille aski naan se surakshit rakhaa gaya he
 The first 10 letters of the English alphabet and numbers up to 1–10 are written using only the top four dots

 Therefore, it is only by writing the points before or after a word that you will know what this sign is
 * khulte va band hote braggit samaan chihn dwa chihnit hai
 Therefore, it will be known only by experiment whether the bracket is opening or closing

 Organization theory refers to the procedures and rules of administrative organizations according to which administrative organizations are governed
 in siddhanton main padsopan, aadesh kii ekta, niyantran kaa kshetra, netritv, paryvekshan, pratyaayojan, samanvay, satta tathaa uttardaayitv ityadi sammilit hai
 'hierarchy' is the Hindi translation of the English word Hierarchy
 'hyrarki' kaa arth he – satta yaa prasthiti kii nimnatam se ucchtam tak ek vyavastha
 This principle is universal
 padsopan ke bina kisi prashasnic sanghathan kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 Most organizations are pyramid shaped

 This division is done both horizontally and vertically
 lamb rup main vibhaajan ke parinamswaroop sheersh prabandh, madhya stareey prabandh, nirikshakon tathaa vishisht kaaryon ke staron kaa gathan kiya jaataa he
 According to the padasopan, the order of the posts according to the ladder is from the lowest rank to the highest position in the stair organization
 sanghathan main nirnay prakriya inhen padon yaa staron se hokar guzarati he
 At the time when the organization is built, there is no consideration of high or low in the minds of organization makers in relation to different levels
 lekin vibhinn pado ke vetankram, vibhinn staron ke dayitvon kii prakruti tathaa vibhinn prashaskeey staron par karyrat carmikon kii yogyata main antar ke kaaran sanghathan vyavhaar main ucch tathaa nimna yaa adhinsthon ke sambandh viksit ho jate hai
 Hierarchy literally means the rule or control of the higher over the lower

 In this hierarchy, each lower post or level is subject to the higher post nearest to it and above that through that post and similarly to the top post or posts
 padsopan kaa yah maanya siddhanth he ki ucch adhikari neeche ke str par sampark karte samay madhyasth padaadhikari kii upeksha nahin kar saktaa
 Similarly, no lower officer can disregard the arbitral officer while establishing contact with the higher officer
 seedhee par chadhate yaa utarate samay kisi bhi danda ko langhna khatre se khaali nahin hota
 Similarly, crossing any level in administration can also create administrative problems in the organization
 sanghathan main samast carmikon se sadaiv uchit madhyam ke dwaara kaary karneki apeksha kii jaati he
 Whenever a correspondence or file goes on in the organization, it passes through each level while going upwards or downwards
 padsopan kii is kramik prakriya ko 'uchit madhyam' bhi kaha jaataa he
 The term stair is an arrangement with which the functions of various individuals of an organization are linked to each other

 The following officer can order his nearest officer
 uttardayitvon ke anek staron ke madhyam se san gathan main swat: hi varisht tathaa adhinsthon ke madhya sambandh sthapit ho jate hai
 In the organization, a pyramidal pattern of relationships of these higher and subordinates develops
 moonay tathaa raily ne pad sopan ko seedhinuma prakriya yaa seedhinuma siddhanth naam diya he
 Moon and Rally say that wherever there will be a people's organization made up of senior and subordinate relations, the principle of stepping will also apply
 moonay ke anusaar yah siddhanth sabhi sanghathanon main paaya jaataa he
 L
 while defining Padasopan D
 White says - The position ladder is the relation of the senior subordinate generated from many levels of responsibilities from top to bottom, which applies everywhere

 According to de Millet, pad sopan is a method in which the efforts of different individuals are interwoven
 moonay tathaa raily ne padsopan vyavastha ko seedhinuma prakriya kaa siddhanth naam diya he tathaa he feol ne ise sopanaatmak shrunkhlaa kaha hai
 According to him, wherever there will be an organization made up of relations of high and subordinates, there will be this stepwise process as well
 kisi bhi sanghathan main kaaryon tathaa uttardayitvon kaa vitaran adi or khadi donon dishaao main hota he
 The vertical division in the organization consists of the positions of the top positions, middle positions and low positions
 jab san gathan main naye pad evam str jode jate hai to yah urdhvadhar vruddhi hoti he, jabaki kshaitijic vibhaajan main pad sopan ke staron main vruddhi kiye bina hi nae nae kaary yaa sthaan jod die jate hai
 In fact, the post-settlement system has to be created due to inequality in salaries, responsibilities, qualifications and status of the personnel

 jahaan Walking or walking or walking is the main type of movement or movement of animals on land and is distinct from running and crawling
 chalanaa daudane se is arth main bhinn he, kyonki chalate samay har kadam par maanav yaa dopyon ke sirf ek pair kaa sampark hi bhoomi se samaapt hota he jabaki daudte samay har kadam par maanav yaa dopyon ke donon pair hi bhoomi se sampark samaapt kar dete hai
 There can be many types of running in horses and other creatures like them, but at every step while walking, they have three legs on the ground
 aaj kii bhaagambhag jindagi ke is daur main pairon se chalanaa lagbhag nahin ke baraabar ho gaya he or vyakti in tamaam phaaydon kii jaankaree rakhte hue bhi paidal chalane se kataraata he yaa yun kah lijie ki ham sab log masini yug ke aa jane ke kaaran aalasy ke agosh main aa gaye hai
 After all, even if it is so, when the facilities of new innovations by scientists have brought us to this level of laziness, due to which walking has started to seem a bit unnecessary
 vastav main yah ek bahut badi kami ko rekhaankit karata he
 Walking has reduced to a large extent in our daily routine, but in present times it has become more important for health than before
 paidal chalanaa bhi ek vyaayaam ke hi baraabar he
 While walking in the morning has a special effect on the entire body, there is a special effect in the body, while the body also relieves joint pain like hands, knees and thighs
 subah ke samay ghoomana har lihaaj se swasthya ke liye uttam hota he
 The surprising thing is that even the old men feel young by walking because on doing so the work of repairing their tissues is done well
 isiliye yadi aap yuva dikhne kii ichha ko man main rakhte hai to adhik se adhik paidal chalem
 Will definitely prove beneficial for health
 tahalne se na keval pachan pranali sahi dhang se kaam karti he apitu kabj se pareshaan vyakti ko bhi avashya hi laabh pahunchaata he
 Moreover, a walk, along with staying good physical health, benefits our mental health more than that
 gauratlab he ki tan man kii thakaan or tanaav ko dur karne hetu sadiyon se yah prachlan istemaal hota aa rahaa he kyonki vyakti ke pairon kii sanrachana daudane kii apeksha zyada chalane ke liye hi ati upyukt he
 Running costs more energy, while the front of the foot, for example, on the heel of the toes, costs 53 percent to 63 percent more than those on the heel
 itnaa hi nahin, pairon ke agle hisse yani panjon ke bal chalate vakt edi par chalane kii apeksha main takhne, ghutane, kuulhe or peeth kii mukhya mansapeshiyon kii kriyasheeltaa kaaphi had tak bad jaati he
 Therefore it is said that instead of running, it is better to walk
 tahaltey samay jo baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie vah yah he ki tahaltey samay shaareerik mudra kaa vishesh samaran rakhana jaruri he anyathaa abhishth laabh nahin miltaa
 While walking, the body should be straight and the mouth should be closed and the breath should be taken completely through the nasal passages
 tabhi laabhadaayak sabit hoga
 Try to breathe through the stomach instead of the lungs
 isse sharir ko adhik oxygen milti he jo dimag tak jaati he or isse sochane or samajhane kii kshamta main khaas badhotaree hoti he
 Although walking can be done at any time, according to experts, morning and evening time is considered suitable for a walk because steroid hormones are released from the body more and more, which makes the person feel pleasant
 so, jab ham tahalne ke liye baahar nikalate hai to sadak va galiyon ke tahalne ke sthaan par ped-paudhon ke madhya park ke bich bich saiyr karne jaisi aadaton ko praathamikta deni chahie
 It is a fact that by walking we see a communication of mental happiness
 paidal chalanaa puri tarah se kayakalp kar saktaa he
 Not only this, it is very beneficial for children studying in the morning to take regular walks in the morning because of the easy development of concentration which does not make much difficulty in remembering
 visheshgyon ke anusaar, praat:kaal tahalne se mastishk main endorphin hormone sravit hota he jis kaaran hamaara mood parivartit hota he or sakaaratmak bhavanaaen utpann hoti he
 Therefore, take a decision to walk on foot from today and get ready to go for long jogging at sunrise and sunset, which is the best workout in the world
 vaise bhi chalanaa hi jindagi he to kyon na khub paidal chalaa jaaen

 In the early period of his career he argued that the power of reasoning develops through symbols and symbols
 vaigotski kaa saamaajik drushitakone sangyanatmak vikaas kaa ek pragatisheel vishleshan prastut karata he
 In fact, Vygotsky declared dialogue between society and its cultural relations as an important dimension in cognitive development of a child
 zaan pyaaze kii tarah vaigotski bhi yah maanate the ki bachche gyaan kaa nirmaan karte hai
 But according to them, cognitive development cannot be isolated, it happens in socio-cultural context along with language-development, social-development, even physical-development
 vaigotsaki ke anusaar bachche ke sangyanatmak vikaas ko samajhane ke liye ek vikasaatmak upaagam kii aavashyaktaa he jo ki iskaa shuru se pareekshan kare tathaa vibhinn roopon main hue parivartan ko thik se pahchaan paae
 Thus a specific mental function such as self-language should be evaluated as developmental processes and not singularly
 vaigotsaki ke anusaar sangyanatmak vikaas ko samajhane ke liye un aujaaron kaa pareekshan ati aavashyak he jo sangyanatmak vikaas main madhyasthata karte hai tathaa use rup pradaan karte hai
 Based on this, they also believe that language is an important tool of cognitive development
 inke anusaar armibhak balykaal main hi baccha apane kaaryon ke niyojan evam samasya samaadhaan main bhashaa kaa aujaar kii tarah upyog karne lag jaataa he
 Waigasky studied at the Institute of Psychology in 1924–34
 yahaan par unhone sangyanatmak vikaas par vishesh kaary kiya, visheshkar bhashaa or chintan ke sambandh par
 His study describes the impact of historical, cultural and social factors on the development of cognition
 vaayagaski ke anusaar bhashaa samaaj dwaara diya gaya pramukh sankethik upkaran he jo ki balak ke vikaas main vishesh rup se mahatvapurn he
 Just as we cannot study a water molecule through its parts, similarly a person cannot be studied separately from his environment
 vyakti kaa uske saamaajik, saanskrithik, aitihaasik or rajnatik sandarbh main adhyayan hi hamen uski samgr jaankaree pradaan karata he
 Waigasky studied onions while studying cognitive development and then developed his approach
 pyaaze ke anusaar vikaas or adhigam do alag dharanaen hai jinamein sangyaan bhashaa ke vikaas ko ek prakritik prakriya ke rup main prabhavit karata he
 After development, learning is the attainment of the necessary skills at that particular stage
 is prakaar pyaaje ke siddhanth ke anusaar vikaas, adhigam kii purvavastha he na ki iskaa parinaam
 That is, the level of learning is above development
 pyaaze ke anusaar adhigam ke liye sarvapratham ek nishchit vikaas str par pahunchnaa aavashyak he
 According to Vygaski, the child has an active participation in the interpersonal process of learning and development, in which language has a direct effect on cognition
 adhigam or vikaas antarsambandhit prakriyaayein he jo chaatr ke jivan ke pehle din se prarambh ho jaati hai
 According to Vygasky, learning at different developmental levels of different children may be identical but not uniform, because the social experience of all children is different
 unke anusaar adhigam vikaas ko prerit karata he
 This approach of his is different from the theory of onions and other theories
 vaayagaski apane saamaajik-saanskrithik siddhanth ke liye jane jate he
 According to this theory, social interaction brings constant changes in the child's thinking and behavior, which may vary from one culture to another
 unke anusaar kisi balak kaa sangyanatmak vikaas uske anya vyaktiyon se antarsambandhon par nirbhar karata he
 Vayagaski combined cognition and social environment in his theory
 balak apane se bade or gyani vyaktiyon ke sampark main aakar chintan or vyavhaar ke samskruti anuroop tareeke sikhte he
 There are several major elements of socio-cultural theory
 pratham mahatvapurn tatv he- vyaktigat bhashaa
 In this, the children interact with themselves to control and direct their behavior
 saamaajik-saanskrithik siddhanth kaa doosraa mahatvapurn tatv he- nikatatam vikaas kaa kshetra
 Waigaski has learned during his experience as a teacher that children can go beyond their actual developmental level to solve problems if they get some instruction
 is str ko vaayagaski ne sambhavit vikaas kaha
 The difference / area between the actual development level of the child and the possible development level was called by Vyagaski as the area of closest development

 Napoleon was exiled to the island of St
 Helena after the defeat of Waterloo, then in 1815 the victorious powers of Europe gathered in Austria's capital, Vienna
 uddeshy tha, europe ke us maanchitr ko punarvyavasthit karnaa jise nepolian ne apane yuddh or vijayon se ulat-patal diya tha
 In fact, Austria's Chancellor Metternich was instrumental in building a front against Napoleon, so on his initiative the Congress was called in Vienna, the capital of Austria

 Due to them, the conference of the Vienna Congress was held in Vienna, the capital of Austria
 iskaa pratham adhiveshan 15 sitambar 1814 ko hi aarambh ho chukaa tha
 The conference included the ruler of the Tsar Alkjender i of Prussia, Friedrich William III of Austria, the Tellerna of France, Metrénique, Austria, and the Foreign Minister of England, Lord Castlere, etc
 In which all the minor rulers of Europe except Turkey were present
 congress kii samasya- The Vienna Congress had many problems
 sarv pratham nepolian ke yudhon ke chalate europea maanchitr main kaaphi parivartan aa gaya tha
 The question of the restoration of these states before the Vienna Congress was the second problem was to suppress the revolutionary spirit
 carch kaa prashn bhi bahut badi samasya thi
 The members of Vienna wanted to reestablish the Church's influence
 chauthi samasya yuddh kii sambhaavna ko samaapt karnaa tha taaki pun: nepolian jaisaa koi shaktishaalee vyakti paidaa nahin ho sake
 Rewarding the conquered nations was another problem
 vienna congress ke siddhant evam uddeshy- The Vienna Congress had some principles for the solution of the above mentioned problems which are as follows
 shakti santulan kaa siddhant- Its main principle was the balance of power, that is, Holland could be extended to Switzerland, Baberia and Serdinia to ban France so that no country could become powerful enough to become dangerous to others
 france chaaron taraf se majboot rajyon se ghir gaya
 In the same way, Germany was made so powerful that the administration could not lift the head
 italy main austria kii sthapit kii gai is prakaar shakti santulan sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 So that power throughout Europe remains at peace
 vaidhata kaa siddhant- On the basis of this principle, the European map of 1789 was adopted by accepting the boundaries and attempting to demarcate various European states
 holland, purtegal, neples, tathaa italy aadi rajya anek puraane rajvansh ko lautaa diya gaya
 Principle of Damage Supply is siddhant ke anusaar jin deshon ko nepolian ne nasht kiya tha or jinhone uske khilaaf sangharsh kiya tha
 It was accepted to compensate and reward them
 jin deshon ne nepolian kaa saath diya tha
 He was punished
 france ke viruddh seemaant rajyon ko shaktishaalee bananaa-iskaa chauthaa siddhant france ke viruddh seemaant rajyon ko shaktishaalee banaaya jaae taaki france antarrashtriya shakti ko bhang nahin kar sake
 Apart from the above principles, it had other principles
 shanti- samjhauta ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye iske peeche bhi shakti honi chahie
 Thus, England, Austria, Russia and Russia gave rise to the European system as a result of this principle of the four-pronged treaty
 vienna congress ke nirnay evam pradeshik vyavastha- The territorial system it established had the following objectives
 jin deshon ne nepolian ko haraane main hissaa liya tha unhen puraskaar or jo parajeet hue the unhen dand milanaa chahie
 In Europe, the system before the revolution should be implemented
 jisase europea vyavastha kaa nirmaan ho or shanti tathaa suraksha kaayam rakhaa ja sake
 The states that Napoleon included in France were taken away
 or france main pracheen rajvansh ko phir se sthapit kiya gaya
 England had colonial and trade benefits
 malta, saint, lucienna, morishas ke dweep france se lekar england ko de diya gaya
 Prasha also benefited by giving him the territories of Northern Saxony, Salasapel and Triale, as a result his kingdom doubled and gained influence in southern Germany
 belgium ko holend main shaamil kiya gaya or vahaan phir se angrej rajvansh kii sthapana kii gai
 Austria was given the territories of Belizea and Lombardi, Italy
 is prakaar madhya europe main uskaa prabhaav kaayam ho gaya or metarnak apane uddeshy main safal rahaa
 Russia received Warsaw and Weisrevig
 falat: pashchimi europe main uskaa kaaphi vistaar hua
 Italy was divided into small kingdoms and given to the ancient rulers there and the influence of Austria was established in Italy
 poland kaa astitv samaapt ho gaya
 Rus, Prasha and Austria divide it among themselves
 spain main pun: pracheen rajvansh kii sthapana kii gai
 Although Purtigal had assisted the British, but nothing was given to it
 sweden or denmark ko dand mila
 Switzerland became more powerful than before
 use 22 rajyon kaa shaktishaalee sangh banaaya gaya
 The decisions of Congress regarding Germany were quite important
 germany ke bache hue 38 rajyon ko milakar ek sangh banaaya gaya
 Whose head was the Emperor Francisco i of Austria
 iske atirikt congress ne or bhi anek kaary kiye usne das- pratha ko aniatik banaaya
 Decisions were also taken regarding international methods
 bhavishya main europea shanti ko kaayam rakhane ke liye ek antarrashtriya sanstha kii sthapana kii gai jise europea vyavastha kaha jaataa he
 Evaluation of the actions of the Vienna Congress- vienna congress kaa aarambh ucch aadarshon evam uddeshyon kii ghoshnaa ke saath hua tha
 But his purpose was not served
 uskaa kaary karne kaa dhang doshapurn tha
 All nations were engaged in accomplishing their selfishness
 at: samasyaon ke samaadhaan main yah asafal rahaa
 The program of the Vienna Conference was based on selfishness
 iske sadasyon ne naitik siddhanton ko apeksha kii
 Therefore, its decisions proved to be temporary redundant
 isane europe ke nav nirmaan main koi aisa prayaas nahin kiya jisase janata kii ichha kii purti ho sake or sthaayee taur par vyavastha kaayam ho sake
 It determined the national boundary only on the basis of the principle of power balance, but gave some importance to the popular sentiment
 isapar dusraa aarope yah lagaaya jaataa he ki isane kuch kaaryon ko adhura chhod diya or kuch samasyaon par isane dhyaan nahin diya jaise- europea shanti ko surakshit rakhane ke ek liye ek sandhi patr par hastakshar karnaa tha lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Some historians have called the Vienna Congress reactionary
 iske liye rashtriya bhaavana kii koi keemat nahin thi isapar yah bhi aarope he ki bade rashtron ke hiton k raksha ke liye chote rashtron ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai
 In spite of the above allegations, one has to accept that political restraint and far-sightedness were employed in Vienna
 germany or italy ke ekikaran kii disha main isane mahatvapurn kaam kiya
 Not only this, the practice of slavery, trade, freedom etc
 was also considered
 rajyon kii araajaktaa ko nasht karne kii disha main isane mahatvapurn kaam kiya
 It also created the international constitution
 iske kaaryon ke falswarup europe main 40 varshon tak shanti bani rahi
 The meeting was called for the first time to discuss international issues
 or isane europea vyavastha kaa sanghathan kiya tha ise ham pratham antareashtriya sangton kah sakate he
 This was a huge achievement
 uparokt uddeshyon tathaa lakshyon kii prapti ke liye vienna kangeras ne kuch siddhanth banaae jo nimna the- The colonial empire of England was increased
 usko malta, elegoland aadi dweep mili tathaa france ke tobgo, morisus tathaa saint lucia ke dweep tathaa spain se trinidad kshetron kii prapti hui
 The boundaries of France were fixed as they were before the revolution
 kranti kaal ke baad sabhi kshetra france se chhin liye gaye
 An amount of 70 crore francs was demanded as war damages
 france ke simavarti kshetron se shaktishaalee rashtron kaa nirmaan kiya gaya taaki bhavishya main france mahadweep kii shanti ko bhang na kar saken
 Louis 18th of the Bourvo dynasty was re-installed on the throne of France
 germany main nepolian se purv pavitra roman samrajya maujuud tha
 Napoleon abolished it and formed the Rhine Union and nationalism spread there
 vienna kangeras is rashtriyata ke prasar ko rokane ke liye katibaddh thi
 Hence, a loosely formed federation was formed there, headed by Emperor Francis of Austria
 austria ko italy main venesia tathaa lombardi ke pradesh die gaye
 South Valacia was also obtained from Poland
 is prakaar austria ne khoi shakti or pratishtha punah praapt kar lee
 Italy was divided into many small states
 italy vastutah, meternik ke shabdon main, keval ek bhugolic abhivyakti ban kar rahaa gaya
 Thus Austria's influence over Italy was established
 vienna kangeras main das pratha kaa virodh kiya gaya
 The Congress created an international institution known as the 'european system' to maintain peace
 pehali baar antarrashtriya samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya gaya
 Through this, the issues of the movement of ships in the rivers, the use of the sea and the mutual dealings between nations were explained
 vienna kangeras kii mukhya uplabdhi yah rahi ki isane europe main lagbhag 40 varshon tak shanti kii sthapana kii jisaki europavaasiyon ko us samay sarvaadhik jarurat thi
 The Vienna Congress tried to establish peace at the international level and established the first international organization by establishing the European system, on whose foundation the foundation of the United Nations and the United Nations was built
 vienna kangeras main france ke saath apekshaakrit nyaaypurna vyavhaar kiya gaya tha or parajeet shakti hone ke baavjood use kangeras main pratinidhitiv diya gaya, jabaki pratham vishwayuddh ke pashchaat varsay kii sandhi main parajeet germany ko pratinidhitiv nahin mila or sandhi ke kade praavdhaan us par thope die gaye
 In conclusion, we can say that the Vienna Congress immediately established peace in Europe
 france ke saath naram vyavhaar karne jaise sakaaratmak kadam uthaae
 But, trying to stop the spread of ideology like liberalism, nationalism, worked against the stream of history
 is drushti se vienna kangeras pratikriyaavaadi maansikta kaa pratinidhitiv karti thi

com / ?page_id=283 samudri laharon main nihit urja main hraas ke liye, tat se lagi hui jo rukaawatein banaai jaati hai, unhen 'pen-urja-tod' kaha ja saktaa he
 For simplicity, they are called Tarangrodh or Pantodar
 khule hue samudratat par sthit bandargahon kii suraksha panatodon dwaara praapt kii jaati he
 Sea waves have a huge amount of energy and storms displace even the heaviest and largest parts, so a lot of expenditure is spent on the construction of watercrafts to protect the ports
 nirmanvidhi va nirmansaamagree ke aadhaar par panatodon ko teen shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he: 1
 Knoll-like or sloping thorns are made of stones or concrete blocks
 2
 khadey, urdhv agrabhagavale panatod lakdi ke creton main pathar bharkar, itan chooney, pathar chooney tathaa kancreet ityadi se banate hai
 3
 In the third category, there are thunderstorms which are made from the combination of both the categories
 nirmaan saamagree kii uplabdhta, pani kii gaharaai, samudr kii tali kaa utaar chadhaav evam prakritik dasha tathaa uplabdh sadhano aadi par inkaa nirmaan aakalp aadhaarit he
 Large stone and concrete blocks found in natural form are used to make this type of thunderstorm
 panatod ko jowar bhaate kii adhiktam oonchaai tathaa tufaani lahar kii oonchaai ke baraabar unchaa banaaya jaataa he
 The top width is also made equal to the height of the storm wave and moveable by a crane, or truck
 panatod ke abhikalp main uski sthirataa or sthayitv ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, dhaal tathaa kis sthaan par kis maap kaa pathar rakhana he, aadi baaten tay kerani hoti hai
 It is common for new thorns to break up in the initial storms, and it is necessary to repair them as soon as possible
 is prakaar dhire dhire ye panatod adhik sthaayee hote jate hai or marammat kaa vyay bhi kam ho jaataa he
 There are three or more parts of a hairpin: light, middle grade and heavy
 halakaa bhaag sabase neeche tathaa bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 It is filled with debris from the mines
 bich kii shrenee kaa bhaag halake bhaag kii dhaalon ko surakshit karne ke liy hota he or isamen kuch kilagram se lekar 4-5 ton tak ke bhaar ke pathar daale jate hai
 The heaviest part is at the top and stones weighing from 1 ton to 10 ton are put in it
 is prakaar ke panatodon kaa abhikalp samudri laharon ke dwaara utpaadit dabaav ke vichaar se kiya jaataa he
 Extreme damage has been observed due to the making of standing pitopod in place of sandstone
 panatodon kii asafalataaon tathaa siddhanton ke adhyayan se, khadey panatod ke prayog ke liye nimnlikhit saavdhaaniyaan nirdhaarit kii ja sakati hai : 1
 The function of this type of thunderstorm is to reverse the waves of the storm, so that it does not go to the other side of the wall
 2
 yadi lahar kii disha tathaa panatod ke sanrekhan main 45 degree se adhik kaa kone ho to lahar palat jaati he
 If the angle is less than 45 degrees, it can damage the thorn
 3
 dhalwaan panatod har prakaar kii samudratali par banaaya ja saktaa he, parantu khadaa panatod keval pakki neenv par, jiske tal radan kaa andeshaa na ho, banaaya ja saktaa he
 4
 Divers are required in repairing foundations for digging, digging of soft rock etc
 and due to this, if the depth of water is high then the watercourses become economically invalid
 iske vipareet khadey panatod ke kuch laabh bhi hai
 Less amount of building material is required
 yadi samudratat par pathar kaa mulya adhik ho tab bhi khadaa panatod sasta rahata he
 The cost of maintenance and repair of this category of water vessels is also less
 mishrit aakalp ke panatod vahaan banaae jate hai jahaan prakritik sthiti aisi hoti he ki mishrit aakalp se vyay main bhi bachat hoti he tathaa nirmaan suvidha bhi mil jaati he
 a lot of research has to be done under this topic in coastal engineering and by looking at small design models in the research centers, it is known that what kind of design can lead to satisfactory results
 panatod kaa vishay kuch pechida he, kyonki samudr kii sthiti tathaa vyavhaar bada parivartansheel hota he
 It is a very difficult task to predict exactly how the sea will react to the terrestrial behavior, yet at many ports and other coastal locations in the world, millennia are thriving, are being made and are broken and formed

 ganit main laghuganak se sambandhit bahut si sarvasamikaaye hai- Logarithms can be used to make calculations easier
 For example, two numbers can be multiplied just by using a logarithm table and adding
 Where b { \ displaystyle b}, x { \ displaystyle x}, and y { \ displaystyle y} are positive real numbers and b ≠ 1 { \ displaystyle b eq 1} 
 Both c { \ displaystyle c} and d { \ displaystyle d} are real numbers
 Note that log b ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ log _ {b} \ ! \ ,} Is undefined because there is no number x { \ displaystyle x \ ! \ ,} Such that bx = 0 { \ displaystyle b ^ {x} = 0 \ ! \ ,}
 In fact, there is a vertical asymptote on the graph of log b ⁡ { \ displaystyle \ log _ {b} \ ! \ ,} At x = 0 { \ displaystyle x = 0}
 Logarithms and exponentials with the same base cancel each other
 This is true because logarithms and exponentials are inverse operations 
 This identity is needed to evaluate logarithms on calculators
 For instance, most calculators have buttons for ln and for log10, but not for log2
 To find log2, one must calculate log10 / log10 / ln, which yields the same result)
 This formula has several consequences: where π { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi \ ,} is any permutation of the subscripts 1, 


, n
 For example The following summation / subtraction rule is especially useful in probability theory when one is dealing with a sum of log-probabilities: which gives the special cases: Note that in practice a { \ displaystyle a} and c { \ displaystyle c} have to be switched on the right hand side of the equations if c > a { \ displaystyle c>a} 
 Also note that the subtraction identity is not defined if a = c { \ displaystyle a=c} since the logarithm of zero is not defined
 More generally: where a 0 , 


, a n > 0 { \ displaystyle a_{0}, \ ldots ,a_{n}>0} 
 a useful identity involving exponents: The last limit is often summarized as "logarithms grow more slowly than any power or root of x"
 Where x> 0 { \ displaystyle x> 0}, b> 0 { \ displaystyle b> 0}, and b ≠ 1 { \ displaystyle b \ neq 1}
 To remember higher integrals, it's convenient to define: Then, The identities of logarithms can be used to approximate large numbers
 Note that logb + logb = logb, where a, b, and c are arbitrary constants
 Suppose that one wants to approximate the 44th Mersenne prime, 232,582,657 − 1
 To get the base-10 logarithm, we would multiply 32,582,657 by log10, getting 9,808,357
09543 = 9,808,357 + 0
09543
 We can then get 109,808,357 × 100
09543 ≈ 1
25 × 109,808,357
 Similar, factorials can be approximated by summing the logarithms of the terms
 The complex logarithm is the complex number analogue of the logarithm function
 No single valued function on the complex plane can satisfy the normal rules for logarithms
 However a multivalued function can be defined which satisfies most of the identities
 It is usual to consider this as a function defined on a Riemann surface
 a single valued version called the principal value of the logarithm can be defined which is discontinuous on the negative x axis and equals the multivalued version on a single branch cut
 The convention will be used here that a capital first letter is used for the principal value of functions and the lower case version refers to the multivalued function
 The single valued version of definitions and identities is always given first followed by a separate section for the multiple valued versions
 The multiple valued version of log is a set but it is easier to write it without braces and using it in formulas follows obvious rules
 When k is any integer: Principal value forms: Multiple value forms, for any k an integer: Principal value forms: Multiple value forms: a complex power of a complex number can have many possible values
 Principal value form: Multiple value forms: Where k1, k2 are any integers: tt Tirumala Express 7487 is a mail express train operated by Indian Railways
