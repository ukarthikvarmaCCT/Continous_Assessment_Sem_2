 The force by which two or more atoms in a molecule are bonded to each other is called a chemical bond
 ye aabandh rasinic sanyog ke baad banate hai tathaa parmaanu apane se sabase paas vaali niskriy gas kaa electron vinyas praapt kar lete hai
 In other words, chemical bonding is the phenomenon in which two or more molecules or atoms are attracted to each other and join to form a new molecule or ion
 yah prakriya sookshm str par hoti he, lekin iske parinaam kaa sthool rup main avlokan kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki yahi prakriya anekanek anuon or parmaanuon ke saath hoti he
 In gas these new molecules exist independently, the molecules or ions in the fluid are loosely connected and in solids they are connected to each other in a rotating structure
 saamanytah rasinic aabandh ko teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he- 1
 Ionic bond- This bond is formed by attraction between ions
 2
 sahasanyojak aabandh - electron ke samaan saajha se banataa he
 3
 Subcomponent bond - is formed by unequal sharing of electrons
 sanyojaktaa aabandh siddhanth￼: In 1927, Hitler and London formed a theory based on coupling and neutralization of opposite electron cycles
 hitler tathaa landan ke anusaar electronic yugma bandha tabhi banataa he jab bhaag lene vaale electronon kaa chakran vipareet dishaao main ho
 In this way, they make their bond neutralized by rotating, which reduces their energy which gives stability to the bond

 ★ Maharishi Parashar is a pioneer in the promoters of Indian astrology
 maharishi proktan granthon main keval inhi kaa sampoorn granth 'brihatparashrahorashastra' naam se uplabdh hai
 The words of other promoter sages are found in this way, but there is no darshan of any complete text
 yah baat parashar ke mat kii sarv vyapaktaa va saarvbhaumikta kaa ek pushkal pramaan he
 Due to the merit and completeness of 'parasharhorashastra', this composition of his is prevalent everywhere
 ★ jyotish shaastra ke sabhi granthon par yadi drushti daali jaye to anubhav hota he ki parvarti aacharyon ke mantavyon kii mul bhitti parashari vichaar hi hai

 Therefore 'parashar Matt' is Ganganad, then other ideologies or Matt rivers

 From this point of view, the place of Maharishi Parashar proves to be higher than the Gemini monk

 ★ 'parashar Tantra' has been mentioned by # Bhattottapal in many places
 unhone # brihajjatak kii tikaa main 'parashari samhita' dekhne va padhane kii baat sweekaar kii he

 Then Avantanti told him that the son of Shakti is in my womb and the sound of his Vedhyayana has been heard

 unhone agni ko himalay ke samtal pradesh main rakh diya
 Pulastya gave him many blessings to commemorate the completion of the demon-session
 unhone bataaya ki krodh karne par bhi tum ne mere vansh kaa muloched nahin kiya

 She convinced Queen Sumitra, mourning at her husband's wish, and touched the king with her hand

 atah ve muniyon ko lekar badarikashram main parashar ke paas gayi
 Parashar explained that in Kali Yuga, the physical strength of the people is low, so penance, knowledge-editing, yagya etc
 are not easily practicable

 As of October 2009, this airliner has once suffered a plane-damage accident in which no passenger was killed, thanks to a fuel component of the Trent 800 engine

 Due to rising fuel costs, airlines have adopted such aircraft as a fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-bodied jets, and have increasingly used such aircraft for long-distance cross-ocean routes

 In the early 1970s, the Boeing 747, mcdonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 Tristar became the first generation wide-structure passenger airliners to enter service
 In 1978 Boeing unveiled three new models: a twin-engined 757 to replace the venerable 727, a twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a Tridget 777 concept competing with the DC-10 and L-1011
 
 The mid-sized 757 and 767 achieved marketing success, partly due to cross-ocean twinjet operations governing regulations of the 1980s (wide-range twin-engine operational performance standard)
 According to these regulations, twin-engined airliners were allowed to cross the ocean for three hours from emergency interchangeable airports

 The Tidget 777 was later discarded after marketing studies supporting the 757 and 767 variants

 By the late 1980s, the DC-10 and L-1011 models were on the verge of retirement and encouraged manufacturers to develop designs for other models instead

 In 1986, Boeing vetoed proposals for an amplified 767, temporarily named 767-X, to target replacement marketing of first-generation wide-bodied airliners such as the DC-10 and to cater to existing 767 and 747 models in the company's lineup

 The initial proposal included winglets as well as longer aircraft and larger wings than the current 767

 Airline customers were unhappy with the 767-x's proposals and instead wanted a wider airlock transverse-cut, fully flexible internal configuration, less than intercontinental-range capability and a lower operating cost than any 767 expansion airliner

 The company opted for a twin-engine configuration based on past design breakthroughs, proposed engine developments, and lower cost advantages
 On 8 December 1989, Boeing began offering 777s to airlines

 For the first time, the development of the airliner was attended by eight major airlines called All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Japan Airlines, Quantus and United Airlines
 yah ek udyog prasthaan abhyaas tha jahaan nirmaataaon ne mote taur par nunatam graahak input vaale vimaan kaa dizin taiyaar kiya tha
 The eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within Boeing as the "working Together" group
 In the first meeting of the group in January 1990, a 23-page questionnaire was distributed to airlines where they were asked what they wanted to include in the new design

 On 14 October 1990, United Airlines became an early customer of the 777 when it ordered 34 Pratt and Whitney-operated aircraft valued at US $ 11 billion, with a choice of 34 additional aircraft
 During the development phase, United also planned to replace the aging DC-10
 United wanted the new aircraft to have the ability to fly from three different routes: Chicago to Hawaii, Chicago to Europe and Denver, a warm and elevated airport, from non-stop to Hawaii
 The Etopes certification was also a priority for United, given the cross-border portion of United's air routes

 This led to the opportunity to connect a virtual aircraft in a structured manner to check for constraints and to verify the proper adjustment of thousands of parts, reducing the need for expensive rework

 Initial plans focused on a resolution of the 777-100X which was an abridged version of the -200 with a lower weight and greater flight capacity, similar to the 747 SP
 haalanki, -100X kii yatri vahan kshamta -200 se kam thi jabaki sanchaalan laagat ek samaan thi jiske falswaroop prati yatri adhik laagat kaa anumaan tha
 By the late 1990s, design plans were changed to create longer-range versions of existing models
 a 100,000-pound-force more powerful engine and higher thrust class were required, leading to active discussions between Boeing and the engine manufacturers
 General Electric proposed to develop the GE90-115B engine while rolls-royce proposed to develop the Trent 8104 engine
 In 1999, Boeing announced an agreement with General Electric, rejecting rival proposals
 As part of the agreement with General Electric, Boeing agreed that the GE 90 engines would be the only powerhouse proposed for the new versions of the 777

 The -300ER, which included an additional capacity of -300 with a range of -200ER, became the best-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, and airlines replaced comparable four-engined models with lower operating costs
 Due to this, they started ordering twin jets

 The 777's design is similar to that of a supercritical airfoil design that rotates back to 31
