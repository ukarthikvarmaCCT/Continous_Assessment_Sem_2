 He believes that Hailey has deliberately suppressed his voice to make it seem as if Malcolm x is himself a reader

 For example, while working with Hailey on the book, Malcolm x had separated from the movement of the Islamic nation

 Starting with Malcolm X's mother's pregnancy, the book describes her childhood in Michigan, her father's death in suspicious circumstances, and her mother's extremely poor mental state that led to her being admitted to a psychiatric hospital

 The serious king Ishwarsena is mentioned in an inscription from Nashik

 Ultimately, some Abhirs became introverted to the Rajput caste and some were called Ahirs, who were considered warriors like Rajputs
 aajkal kii ahir jati hi pracheen kaal ke aabhir hai
 The description of Abhiras is also found in the Kshatrapa inscriptions of Saurashtra
 puraanon va bruhatsamhita ke anusaar samudragupta kaal main bhi dakshin main aabhiron kaa nivas tha
 After that this caste also settled in other parts of India

 avogadro kaa niyam gas se sambandhit ek niyam he jiskaa naam amedio avogadro ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 It is also known as "avogadro's Vision" and "avogadro's Theory"
 san 1811 main avogadro ne yah pariklpana prastut kii, jo is prakaar he - In 1811 AD, Italian chemist Avogadro explained the difference between atom and atom, stating that atom is the smallest particle of an element which participates in chemical activity and may or may not have independent existence
 anu padaarth kaa vah chote se chota kan he jisamen padaarth ke saare gun vidyaman hon or uskaa swatantra astitv sambhav ho
 Avogadro was the first to say that only the independent existence of molecules is possible in gases and not atoms, that is why the volume of a gas must be expressed by the molecules present in it
 is aadhaar par aavogadro ne nimnlikhit sambandh vyakt kiya he : Initially this relationship was called Avogadro's hypothesis, but later when it was tested by experiments it came to be called Avogadro's theory
 or ab ise 'aavogadro kaa niyam' kehete hai
 This rule is used in the modification of the atomic theory and in explaining the rule of Gelusak
 tathvik gaison kii parmanukta nikaalane main, anu bhaar gyaat karne main, gaison ke bhaar aaytan ke sambandh ko gyaat karne main tathaa gaison ke vishleshan main is niyam kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Number of Avogadro - The number of molecules in one gram molecular weight of any gas is the same
 is sankhya ko hi aavogadro kii sankhya kehete hai
 Its value has been fixed to 6
02x1023 by various methods
 aavogadro kii sankhya paanch vishwa sthiraanko main se ek he
 It denotes the Roman letter n
 hydrogen evam nitrogen ke samaan aaytan main anuon kii sankhya samaan hogi yadi ve ek hi taap va daab par rakhin ho tathaa adarsh gas ke samaan vyavhaar kar rahi hon
 In practice this rule is not completely true for real gases but is "almost true"
 jahaan: The most important conclusion of Avogadro's law is that the value of the ideal gas constant is the same for all gases
 arthath The value of is the same for all gases, irrespective of their size or mass
 yahan: One mole of an ideal gas occupies 22
4 liters of space at standard heat and pressure
 is aaytan ko praaia: adarsh gas kaa molr aaytan kehete hai

 Artism is known as the antonym of utilitarianism in the field of literature and art
 is siddhant kaa pratipaadan victor kuje ne 1818 main kiya
 According to it, the purpose of art is not to achieve any moral or religious purpose, but to seek its own perfection
 kala soundaryanubhuti kaa vaahak he isaliye ise upyogita kii kasuti par nahin parkhaa janaa chaiye
 Adherence to the rules of society, policy, religion, philosophy etc
 are a hindrance to the free and spontaneous expression of art
 kalavaadiyon ke anusaar kalakaar lokottar praani, kala lokatit vastu tathaa kalajanya anand alokik aswadyukt evam samajanirpeksh hota he
 Conversely, utilitarian art is considered not only as a powerful means of changing the attitudes of the society towards the desired direction, but also considers it as the best medium of principle propagation
 upyogetavaadiyon ne kalavaadiyon par sankeern evam vyaktinishth hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha he, ve viviya ghode par arudh hai
 The Artists accused Utilitarians of being a subservient to gross socialism and said, they had promised to give us heaven, but have given Rugnalaya
 vichaarkon kaa ek teesraa varg bhi he jo kalawaad ke vyaktipaksh or upyogetavaad ke samajapaksh ke samanvay ko hitkar maanata he
 The ostensible power of the artistic approach is constantly found in Europe in some form or the other from Plato and Aristotle to the present day
 plato ne apane granth 'republic' main kaviyon or kalakaaron ko rashtrabahishkrut kar dene kii vyavastha di he; kaaran, unki drushti main kalpanasheel kalakaaron evam kaviyon kaa aseem prabhaav naitik evam saamaajik drushti se avaanchhneeya tha
 Even though Aristotle has not openly refuted the moral and social beliefs of his mentor Plato, as well as the moral elements and didacticism in art have not disproved them, Aristotle, according to the famous philosopher Butcher, was the first to initiate ethics
 Isolated and told that refined bliss is the ultimate goal of poetry or art
 rome ke prasiddh vichaarak sisaron ne shaleenta tathaa udaattata ko kala kaa pramukh pratipaadya nirdhaarit kiya he
 Longinus in his work 'periapsus' not only considered art as distinct and superior to education and entertainment, but also distinguished it on the higher plane of communication and advised its independent evaluation
 longinus ke anusaar kavy tathaa kala kaa mukhya tatv udaatt he or bhaavana kaa udaattikaran hi unka pradhan parinaam hota he jiskaa vyakti se bhi or samaaj se bhi sidhaa sambandh rahata he
 Therefore, Longinus is certainly centrist in his statement and rendering
 dionisis tathaa demetrius prabhruti anya anek roman vichaarkon ne kavy tathaa kala ke shailipaksh par hi vishesh jor diya he
 Pallavan of classical or classical art of Europe was mostly under the protection of Christianity or 'church'
 at: saatvin se 15veen shatee isvi ke bich rome ko centre maanakar jis baijantiya kala kaa vikaas misr se rus tak hua, vah carch ashrith hone ke kaaran naitik-dharmik-mulya-samanvit thi, at: uskaa soddeshy tathaa upadeshaatmak hona jaruri tha or isiilie usamen kalapaksh gaun hi rahaa
 Even then it is not that there was no relaxation of imagination and feelings in the art of the said period
 iske vipareet dharmik drushtisampann kalakaar bina kisi bahari niyantran athwa baadhyataa ke ucch koti kii kala kaa srijan karte the
 Tolstoy was strongly opposed to the artistic ideology
 unke mat se dharm ke prati vishwaas kaa abhaav hi kalavaadi vichaaron ko janm detaa he or kala kaa saadhy na anand he, na hi saundarya
 He was adamant about morality and like Gandhiji his outlook was reformist
 sudhaarwad prakarantar se upyogetavaad hi he
 Therefore, for Tolstoy, art was definitely a secondary instrument

 Dante's influence lasted only a few days
 pashchaat shastreey drushti dhire-dhire romani drushtikon se aachhadit hone lagi
 As a result, there was a huge change in the artistic values at this time
 17veen shatabdi ko kala kii drushti se kaaphi mahatvapurn kaha ja saktaa he
 Neoliberalism emerged in France during this period
 lekin yah bhi madhyakaalin chintan ke naveen sanskaran se adhik nahin tha
 Medieval moral values began to disintegrate in Europe after Renaissance, which not only created an atmosphere of instability between traditionalist and independent ideas, but also led to a mutual conflict
 iskaa kaaran is samay kisi sudrudh darshan kaa abhaav tha
 In 1866 AD, in the enforcement of almost diverse literary and artistic promises, in France, the French country, 'l'art Por l'art', came out with a formula whose English translation is 'art for Art's Sec' and in Hindi with the phrase 'art for Art' Is known
 yaheen se kalavaadi vichaardhaara kaa pratyaksh aarambh mana ja saktaa he
 American painter James Abbott mcneil Hwisler, who lived in France and England for a lifetime, became a strong supporter of artism
 hua yah ki 1877 i
 main grosvener chitrakala pradarshnee main angreji ke prakhyat samalochak ruskin ne hvisler ke chitron kii tikhi aalochana kii or kaha, hvisler apane chitron ke madhyam se darshakon ke chehron par rangabhari pyaaliyaan undel detaa he
 Ruskni's statement triggered a court trial in which Hwisler eventually received a fathering as compensation
 iske baad bhi kala ke uddeshy ko lekar ruskin or hvisler ke bich vadavivaad chalata rahaa
 Ruskin considered art to be completely independent and self-contained apart from morality
 isi se prerit hokar hvisler ne apni puri shakti se 'kala kala ke liye' mat kaa pravartan kiya jo atvaad kii seemaa tak ja pahunchaa
 Bradley, Clive Bell, Roger Fai, and George Innes, etc
, were strong advocates of the critical critical ideology
 breadle ne to apane granth 'poetry for poetries sek' main spasht rup se ghoshnaa kii ki naitikta kavita kaa maatr bahya paksh he
 Therefore, it is absolutely irrational to consider it essential for the superiority of the poem
 clive bel ne aadhunik chitrakala ke sandarbh main rupatatv ko pramukh mana or 1914 i
 main 'siganifikent farm' kaa siddhant prastut kiya jiskaa punaradha roger faai ne 1920 i main kiya
 Artism gained a clear philosophical foundation from the expression of Croche
 kaant kii sthapana 'saundarya kaa koi bahya astitv nahin he' ko aadhaar banaakar kroche ne apane 'laa spirito' naamak granth main saundaryabodh ke liye 'ant: pragna' kii satta kaa pratipaadan kiya or bataaya ki saundaryasrishti tathaa saundaryanubhuti donon hi sookshm maansik vyapaar hai
 At the same time there is elemental unity between varna and manifestation
 at: kalapaksh or vastupaksh ko vicchhinn karke dekhnaa bhraamak he
 According to Croche, art is basically a spiritual activity, so in its view, art has no other purpose or purpose except expression
 itnaa hi nahin, kroche ne kala ko naitik kinwa shaikshanik simaaon se mukt bhi mana he
 In a way, utilizing Croche's theory in a way denies utilitarian recognition, but the said principle applies only to the intangible trade of art, not to the tangible
 kroche kaa kala siddhant tatvat: samajavirohi nahin he kyonki moort hone par vah bhi kala ko samajanirpeksh nahin maanata
 The artistic vision was also strengthened by the 'dreamism' of Freud

richards ne apni pustak 'principles ov litereri critisine' main kalavaadi drushti kaa khandan saidhantik aadhaar par karte hue preshniyata ko kavyprakriya main vishesh mahatv pradaan kiya tathaa kaha ki kavy kii satta shesh jagat se bhinn nahin he or na hi kavy kii anubhuti shesh jagat kii anubhuti se bhinn he
 Thus Richards re-established utilitarianism in the field of art
 marxvad ke udai ke saath kalavaadi manyataon kaa teji se vighatan hua
 Marx adopted a utilitarian approach to art in his economics and said that art is for the public, mainly for soldiers and workers
 stallin ne rus main or maao ne china main kala tathaa sahitya ko raajnneeti ke prachaar kaa pramukh saadhan mana evam usapar rajshakti kaa ankush laga diya
 In his circular titled 'problems of Art and Literature', Mao expressed his faith in the above mentioned installations of Marx
 marxvaadi samalochak codwell ne bhi kalavaadi vichaardhaara ko vishuddh burjua drushti se utpann kutsit vritti kaa parinaam bataaya he
 In the Marxist camp, Trotsky is the only person who considers the interference of political party in the field of art unfair
 'litarechar and revolution' naamak apane granth main usne spasht kaha he, kala ke kshetra main party ko aadesh dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 It is fine that the duties of the party are also to protect and assist the art, but leadership can be done only indirectly in that area

 Wittgenstein has been a professor at the University of Cambridge
 vitgenshtin ke pita karl ek yahudee the jinhone baad main protestant dharm apana liya tha
 Wittgenstein's greatest contribution is to put language in a philosophical perspective
 aaj koi bhi bhashaa vigyaan main jab darshan kaa ullekh karata he to vitganstin kaa naam swatah samaran hota he
 Wittgenstein's writings have resulted in considerable argumentation, even many times Wittgenstein's work has been called a paradox, but it would be wrong to say that logicians had emphasized logical analysis of language even before Wittgenstein
 vitganstin ke guru bartrand rasal rahe hai kaa tarkshastra ko darshan main uchit sthaan dilaane main baari yogadan he
 Wittgenstein's philosophical life is quite interesting because he has refuted his earlier works in his later works
 apni pehle kii pustakon main vitganstin satya ke liye bhashaa kaa mahatv bataate najar aate hai kintu apni antim pustak "philosophical investigations" main vitganstin ne bhashaa main vyaapt bis kaa vivaran kiya he
 Wittgenstein's conclusion proved to be new and important to the philosophical world
 vitgenstin ne ek prakaar se is vichaar kaa pratipaadan kiya ki bhashaa se satya kaa vivaran nahin balki satya kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 All western philosophy is rooted in language, but language shows us only one form of truth, the truth which we create by our belief or experience
 vitgenstin baar baar ek bhashakreedaa kaa ullekh karte hai, jisamen bhaag lene vaale kisi satya kii abhivyakti ke liye bhashaa kaa nirmaan va upyog karte hai
 Through this play, we tell the difference in the facts and truths related to the Wittgenstein language
 apni nirnaatmak pustak "philosophical investigations" main wo kehete hai ki " adhiktar baar jab ham shabd ke "arth" kii baat karte hai, tab ham keval ek bhashaa main us shabd ke yojan kii baat karte hai "

 This class believes that the relationship between language and society cannot be separated from its context of linguistics

 Lebav's statement is that Sociolinguistics cannot be considered such a different genre, because Sociolinguistics is the actual linguistics

 It is a belief of social linguistics that it is incompatible to separate language from this social perception or its social purpose

 In this way, we see that in the social language, where the society speaks at the same pace, it never wants to pay attention to the language and gives special attention to the convenience of communicating happiness

 According to a recent linguistic estimate, a total of six thousand eight hundred and nine languages were spoken in the world at one time, but their number is decreasing rapidly
 kyonki 90 pratishat bhashaayen aisi hai jinke bolne waalon kii sankhya ek lakh se kam he
 There are 537 languages whose speakers are less than fifty, but the more disturbing condition is that of the 46 languages which are going to end in the coming few years because only one person of theirs is left
