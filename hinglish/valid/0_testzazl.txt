 In those days, in those days, every time there was a jumla on his tongue - "don't meet heart, keep shaking hands
" Above i mentioned unfamiliarity
 mahatvapurn yah bhi he ki suranjan ke saath parichay ke kshan jab bhi gahraate najar aae, ek duuri sadaiv mere man main bani rahi
 man ke kisi kone main avasthit koi sadaiv yah chetata rahaa ki saavdhaan yahaan se aage varjit kshetra he
 This is your Lakshmanrekha
 sambhav he iskaa kaaran meri koi kuntha yaa kamajori rahi ho
 ki bachapan ke sanskaar


sambandhon ke bich surakshit duuri banaae rakhane kii pravriti, jo ab jane-anjaane mere swabhaav kaa hissaa ban chuki he
 Suranjan has also drawn such Lakshmanrekhas for himself, i do not know
 But it is so certain that there is definitely more distance between him and his Lakshmanrekhas
 jo unhen apane parichiton se antarang hone kaa apekshaakrit zyada avasar pradaan karata he
 i am not familiar with how many differences Suranjan has with me, but one thing i can emphasize that hardly any occasion has come in all these years, when there is such a high wall between us, which is impossible to reach
 
 The urge to establish unfamiliarity even during the period remained more or less on both sides
 Thus it is the untouchable unfamiliarity, which has helped to maintain the continuity of our introduction
 suranjan ek sahityakar hai
 He has written poetry-story-novel-child literature
 Be it poetry or prose, he has done penmanship on the same subjects, which he himself has experienced or experienced
 unamem ek motaa upanyaas ‘mandi house: yah main hum main’ bhi he
 The poem is very intense, dense and sharp
 a story or a novel if it is something shallow, shallow
 However Subhash Chander has praised 'mandi House 


' during the role
 magar mujhe unke upanyaas priy nahin lagate
 meraa maananaa he ki suranjan multah kavi hai, isliye unki kahani-upanyaason main kathanak kaa paryaapt vikaas ho hi nahin paata
 upar se anubhuti kii pramanikta ko, nijee anubhutiyon ko jyon kaa tyon banaae rakhane kaa dabaav bhi rachana ko bojhil or apthaneey banaata he
 His poems are also victims of the pressure of self-realization
 suranjan chhipaana nahin jaanate
 shaayad yah chal unhone siikhaa hi nahin he
 The pain of his poet is the pain of the whole world, he often shows it
 ek rachanaakaar ke rup main suranjan kii puri duniya do khaanon main simati he
 The first meal consists of those whom they believe to be theirs, whom they love
 duusare main ve hai jinke prati unke man main aakrosh bharaa rahata he
 Therefore, his compositions often contain the same characters which he finds in his life to be immediately acceptable or unacceptable
 anubhuti kii saghanta lekhan ke liye dabaav banaati he, jisase ve nirantar kuch na kuch rachate rahete hai
 But under the immense pressure of privacy, his creations become a medium for the expression of personal outrage, frustration, or blood pressure
 suranjan kaa gadhy bhi kavitaai liye hota he
 This naturally brings elegance to his compositions
 magar kabhi-kabhi isse kathanak kii gatyaatmakataa shithil padane lagati he, jo pathneeyata ke liye utani hi jaruri shart he
 That is why Suranjan got more fame from prose than his poems
 isse suranjan bhi santusht hi hai
 By the way, i liked the title of his novel 'mandi House: Yeh Main Hoon Main' more than its plot
 However, as i said earlier, it is played by Suranjan's self-realization
 sidhaa-sada aatmakathaatmak upanyaas, jisamen unhone jaisaa dekha-bhoga vah aayaa he
 She is the only woman from whom the world of Suranjan's feelings is settled
 upanyaas main yatharth, sex, samvednaaen aadi sabakuch hai
 But the neutrality and ruthless introspection that autobiographical compositions demand is nowhere in this novel
 vastutah yah suranjan kii seemaa bhi he
 The symptom of hypersensitivity is that it does not allow the brain to go beyond a radius
 In such a situation, if self-immolation is involved, then the literature of the work becomes in crisis
 aatmshlagha kaa shikaar manushya duniya ko do hisson main baantkar dekhtaa he
 One that is of his use
 uski swarthpurti main sahaayak he
 Secondly, only the benefit of others is possible
 chunki samvednaaen man ke teevr aaveg hoti hai, isliye ve kshan-kshan parivartasheel bhi hote hai
 In such a state, even the realm of friends and enmity cannot remain the same
 They also keep changing their axles
 yani ek kshan vishesh main mitra rahaa vyakti kshan-vishesh main dushmani ke daayre main bhi aa saktaa he
 And a person in the line of enemies can also become friends at any moment
 atisamvedansheeltaa vyakti ko aatmakendrit or kabhi-kabhi krur bhi bana detii he, jiskaa khamiyaja us vyakti ke nikatwartiyon ko uthaanaa padataa he
 Suranjan's novel 'mandi House 


' seems to me as a metaphor for the strength of this country's democracy
 mandi house or uske aasapaas kaa ilaaka rajdhani ke samskruthikarmiyon kaa sabase pasandida thikaana he
 There is a huge gathering of Sanskritikarmis and litterateurs from the capital and outside
 isliye is parikshetra ko dilli kii saanskrithik rajdhani kahkar pukarana katai atishyokti nahin lagata
 main bataa duun ki is upanyaas ko suranjan ne mandi house kii cantine, yahaan ke parkon main baithe-adlete hokar likhaa he
 Those were the days of his last struggle
 ghar se khaali pet nikalnaa, mandi house pahunchakar vahaan shaam tak mitron ke saath gapiyate rahanaa, fursat ke kshanon main likhnaa
 bhukh lage to jo mili kha lenaa
 apane ekaaki jivan ke teevr santrason ko raftaa-raftaa lekhnee ke jariye kaagaj par utaarna
 mujhe lagata he ki sudur bihar ke saadhaaran kasbe se aayaa ek vipann, saadhanviheen, alpashikshit or bhavuk kalamkaar ko, jo bina kisi gadfadar ke sirf apni kalam dwaara, un saanskrithik pratishthanon ko chunauti dena chahta tha, jo chand chatukaaron tathaa avasarwaadiyon ke boote, naukarshahon or bhrashtachariyon kaa adda ban chuke hai
 For whom literature and culture are merely 'goods' in the market
 saadhaaran utpaada, jinaki upyogita dhan kamaane tak simit he
 Making more profit by selling them is more important for them than any question of human concerns
 un jad pratishthanon ko suranjan is upanyaas ke sheershak dwaara maano ek chunauti dete hai
 It can be said that this is a challenge to the modern selfish and individualist centers from a self-respecting, struggling and confident writer
 ek lalkaar he, samvedansheel kalamkaar kii ore se
 kai maamalon main suranjan khaase nirmam bhi hai
 This cruelty is nothing less for others than for ourselves
 khaskar maamla jab lekhan kaa ho
 kabhi-kabhi to khari or belaag baaten bhi ve itani maasoomiyat se kah jate hai ki unka dushman bhi gussa pi jaataa he
 However, Suranjan has been harmed by the anger
 isse unki rachanaatmakataa baadhit hui he
 An angry person is unable to give his best
 Most of his poems tell the story of loneliness, repeating themselves over and over again
 unamem se adhikansh tab likhi gayi, jab vah ghar-parivaar se dur, apane kamare main simate, ekaaki, khud ko bhulane kii jaddojahad se guzar rahe hote the
 Suranjan's best poems are also those, which are born out of his dense despair and suffering
 din-bhar kii hataasha se lagbhag tuutakar, jinhen unhone apane hi bheetar duubate-utaraate hue rachaa he
 If he has a rage to run away from life, then he has a great affection for it
 This same state of internal struggle is present in the poems of Suranjan with zealous philosophicalism
 jo astitvvaad ke kareeb se guzarati he
 Suranjan's poet with pain has not communicated under any fashion, as most of our poets do
 suranjan kii kavitaaon main chhalchalaati pidaa unke asmitabodh kii dena he
 Therefore, when he says that Suranjan wears, wears and spreads the poem, nothing seems exaggerated in it
 Like other poets, Suranjan considers his greatness to be engrossed in his creativity, becoming united with it, rather than claiming to be a great poet
 ek kalamkaar kaa apni vidha main visarjan kaa bhav, duusare shabdon main us us vidha kaa aatmsatikaran kar lenaa he
 This can be the goal of any dedicated Kalamkar
 suranjan is lakshya ko paa sake hai, yah unke vyavhaar se bhi siddh hota he
 While reading some of his emotional poems, i remember the English poet PB style
 suranjan ke kuch sangharshon kaa main sakshi rahaa hum
 jindagi jamaane ke liye bahut-se papad unhone bele hai
 From publishing to shopkeeping
 From Sahityarath to Swapna Rath


 and then one after another, proof reading, these days are associated with the Kathasansar
 vakt kaatane ek dukaan bhi he
 That is their publication, the same printing house
 And in other words, there is also a retail stationery shop
 par bechaini ab bhi jyon kii tyon he
 In fact, to set up a business, he needs skill
 He is missing in Suranjan
 vah sapane dekhte hai, parantu unhen kaarobaar main badalane ke hunar se anbhigya hai
 Today, when there is competition in every field, people demand results not dreams, dreaming can be called a hobby
 kathasansar ke madhyam se mujhe suranjan ke kai nae pahaluon kii jaankaree bhi mujhe mili he
 If you tease them, the matter will go on pulling
 Some subjects are definitely eager to get on paper
 shaayad pathakon kii bhi unamem ruchi ho
 suranjan kii manamaani kaa kuch hissaa to in prasangon ke jariye baahar aayega hi
 kathasansar ke praarambhik ankon ke prakaashan se main bhi judaa rahaa hum
 meri ichha thi or shaayad nayaa-nayaa utsaah bhi, jiskaa vyaavhaarikta ke dharaatal se, us hakeekat se jisase patrika chalaane ke liye uske prakaashak or sampadak ko roj do-chaar hona padataa he, koi sambandh nahin hota
 to meri ichha thi ki patrika apana swatantra charitra viksit kare
 prarambh ke kuch ankon main aisa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 khud suranjan main bhi bharpoor utsaah tha
 Therefore, he found some such writings which, despite being published earlier, stood the test of contemporaryism
 prakaashan ke baad unpar khub charchaa bhi hui thi
 In those days, for the difficult struggle Suranjan was going through, the question of livelihood was most important
 jise vah kathasansar ke madhyam se hal karne kaa khbaab dekharahe the
 Editors and writers are also human beings and they also have some needs, seeing that there was nothing wrong in this
 pet kii bhukh main naitikta ke sawaal akasar dab jaaya karte hai
 Even then i was confident that Kaviman Suranjan would not let his patience go
 He came to the magazine's field after trying out the rest of the bread and bread
 vah unhen bahut aasaan bhi laga tha
 Perhaps time was also with him
 isliye ‘kathasansar’ sheershak panjikrut bhi ho gaya
 saahitiyik patrika ke kshetra main spardhaa thi to shreshthatar kaam karne par safalataa kii sambhaavnaaen bhi kam nahin thim
 i also felt that if the magazine is taken out with commitment, then it will gradually make its way into the readers' minds
 Which in turn will be able to create a new readership to suit its character
 Obviously, i had this somewhat idealistic thinking, which had no relation with reality
 jivan kii dainandin kii samasyaayein mujhe utana nahin kachotati thim, jitani ki ve suranjan ko vichlit rakhti thim
 The magazine came out, but there were some needs, and some of the reprehensibility, which were the product of Suranjan's self-sacrifice, they all derailed the story on which the idea of running was thought of when they started
 baharhaal kathasansar suranjan kii patrika he or usko vahi hona hoga, jaisaa ki ve chahenge
 kathasansar aarambh karne se pehle mujhe lagata tha ki suranjan main vyavsaayik kushalta kaa abhaav he
 i had this impression after seeing the failure in the steps he took one after the other in the initial phase of extracting the magazine
 unka magadh prakaashan bhi praayah thapp-sa tha
 They could not shop
 or sahityarath ko bech-bachakar waapas gaya lautnaa padaa tha
 These failures indicated that they are beyond professional skill, at least commercial skills
 parantu kathasansar ke madhyam se baaki logon kii tarah meraa bhi bhram tutaa
 sampadak ke rup main suranjan kii chaturaai


kisi ghaagh sampadak jaisi hi thi
 It was the excess of pragmatism that the 'stree Shakti special' of the Kathasanar should be announced without any dedication or commitment to the female strength
 a disputed comment in the same issue, that a woman has to be below the man, '' also came as a part of the property
 Those who have prick on this statement, keep getting hurt, if anyone feels sad, Suranjan is not worried about it
 His tendency is not to have fun by setting fire, but this is what happened in that incident
 patrika kii baari aachochana bhi hui
 lekin kuch chhapaas premi lekhikaon ke saath aa jane se suranjan par koi khaas farak nahin padaa
 yahi kyon kargil yuddh ke dauraan ubhari rashtravaadi bhaawanaaon main aae ubaal ko vah bazaar kii anya shaktiyon kii bhaanti, patrika ke yuddh visheshank ke jariye bhunaanaa chaahate the
 Lainan Award was announced in the name of Arundhati Roy
 Arundhati distributes the award received by the Ford Foundation of America to social organizations and various magazines
 khabar milte hi suranjan ke liye vah ‘duniya kii sabase acchhee ladki’ ban jaati he
 As the best girl in the world is also the title of Suranjan's poem book
 ek panth do kaaj, suranjan arundhati ko khush karne kii koshish ke saath apni kavita pustak ko bhi charchaa main le aate hai
 In the editorial of the female special issue, he makes even stronger comments against woman-identity
 or apni baat ke samarthan main aise aise tark ki aap bas sir dhunate rah jaaen
 suranjan kii mukharata, belaag baton kaa main prashansak rahaa hum
 kathasansar kaa vah sampadakeey apane aap main virodhabhasi kaa bahusootreey silsilaa tha
 But instead of starting a meaningful discussion through this, Suranjan's intention was to bring the magazine into controversy on the pretext
 prakaashanarth ai saamagree se bhi vah apeksha karte ki usamen kuch chankane vaala ho
 lekhakon se mulaakaat yaa rachana ke liye aagrah ke samay to vah aisa aksar kehete hi the
 Suranjan is not alone among those who call attention to people through controversy and dream of wealth
 hindi main aise bahut se sampadak-sahityakar hai, jo bheed main pathar uchhaalkar khalabali machaakar uskaa majaa lutate rahete hai
 Suranjan is also one of them
 par is maamle main ve dusron se jaraa anaadi kism ke
 shaayad isliye ki vah bada game nahin khel pate
 is khel ke chatur sujan khilaadi unki pahunch se baahar hai
 They are satisfied with small tricks like small happiness
 choti-choti chizon se bahal janaa, yah akele suranjan kii nahin, balki har bhavuk kavi-lekhak kii aadat hoti he
 i have said that Suranjan is basically a poet
 or main unki kavita kaa pathak, ghanghor bhavukta kaa prashansak bhi rahaa hum
 magar bhavukta vaicharik taratamyata ko panpane nahin detii
 aise main suranjan kii safagoi unke liye dhaal kaa kaam karti he
 We can agree and disagree with his opinion
 par is baat ke liye suranjan kii tarif kerani hogi ki ham jaise log jo kai-kai mukhauton ke saath logon se pesh aate hai, aise main suranjan ke paas hamaari apeksha bahut kam mukhute hai
 They are also very intelligent or say that they are not able to use them cleverly
 Suranjan's candor makes him invulnerable than we are
 jis sangharsh ke daur se vah gujarey hai, usko dekhte hue yah koi vicitra yaa aswabhaavik sthiti bhi nahin he
 Due to his stubbornness and cynicism, Suranjan has not taken any damage
 baar-baar ujadane or basane ke peeche unki sanakon kaa hi haath rahaa he
 That is why he keeps playing the game of getting and leaving the job
 shaayad isi kaaran unka jivan-sangharsh itnaa lanbaa khinchataa gaya
 aaj bhi jo unke paas he, jis kathasansar ne unhen punahsthapit karne main madad kii he, unki lokapriyata main ijapha kiya he, use bhi thukrakar vah kab kisi nae sansar kii rachana main lag jaaenge, koi nahin jaanata
 khud suranjan bhi ko yah kahaan maaloom he
 Taking a test of his nature, senior narrator Jagdish Kashyap had given Suranjan the likeness of the Phoenix bird
 unani lokkathaon kaa yah mithkeey paatr apni hi chita kii raakh se punah jivan paata rahaa he
 Parallel to this have been myths in Indian legends
 suranjan ke vyaktitv ke anuroop isse sateek upama meri nigaah main to or ho nahin sakati
 suranjan ko lekar kehane ke liye bahut-si baaten hai
 There are many important, memorable moments that have been eaten together over a span of eight-ten years
 bahut kuch seekhney ko mila he mujhe unase
 khaskar vartanee kii samaj
 un dinon likhte samay beshumaar galtiyaan karata tha main
 halanki main darshanashastra main parasnatak tha or vah bamushkil saat-aath jamaat paas
 iske baavjood mujhe yah kehane main koi hichak nahin he ki sahitya or lekhan sambandhi samaj suranjan ke paas mujhase kahin adhik thi
 He got to know many things in formula form which are still very useful today
 aaj sahitya jagat man paanv tikaane laayak yadi main jagah bana paaya hum to uske peeche suranjan jaise mitron kaa yogadan kam nahin he
 In the last part of this article, i would like to comment on the part of Suranjan, due to which he keeps inviting controversies
 saath-saath baatcheet main unhone apane jivan-sangharsh se tukade-tukade parichay karaayaa he
 i know that they have suffered many times more than i have told them
 jitna usne mujhase kaha he, usamen atishyokti kii maatra kam se kam he
 Probably as much salt as flour
 Suranjan's specialty is that he is surprisingly honest in such matters, even then there are deep questions about his life, about which i have always been curious
 parantu unhen lekar suranjan se baatcheet karne kii kabhi himmat hi na padi
 par main jaanata hum ki un prashnon par jab bhi charchaa hogi, unki eemaandaaree hamaare bich rahegi
 suranjan kii charchaa ho or sex par baat na ho, yah asambhav he
 This is the aspect of his personality, which is known more or less
 uske saathi bhi or aalochak bhi
 is maamle main sabaki raay lagbhag ek jaisi he
 Suranjan himself never hides anything about this
 Perhaps they are the most vocal on this issue
 bagaiyr kisi kii parvaah kiye
 aksar main sochataa hum ki suranjan ke maanas main koi aisi kutil granthi he
 That suddenly provokes them to make them move around
 vah granthi kab, koun-si chaal chalane ko majaboor kar de, iskaa akalan unke khaas mitra hitaishi bhi nahin kar pate
 mujhe lagata he ki boond, ek lanbaa-sa saanp, sristi jaisi unki kavitaayen, saamaanya kavi maanas kii srujanaayen nahin hai
 They are the product of this eucharistic gland, towards which i have indicated above
 ye vikrut kamkunthaon kii bhi upaj hai jo suranjan ke maanas main gahare kahin bahut gaharaai tak samaai hui hai
 Whose fathom is not available to an ordinary penman like me
 But these frustrations have not developed in any one day
 na hi ye unke maanas main aadi ropit ho sakati hai
 Rather, it is the result of the difficult struggle that Suranjan has enjoyed living alone, away from home and family
 ye un paristhitiyon kaa kufal hai, jo kathin sangharsh ke dinon main unka har pal imtihaan leti rahi hai or unke vyaktitv se chipak-si gai hai
 But because of them, anyone sees them with hatred or accuses them of obscenity, i will not like this Suranjan either
 Rather, due to these, Suranjan collects the sympathy of all of us spontaneously
 kyonki unhone jo bhoga vah asaadhaaran he
 i find it a challenge to examine the interludes of Suranjan's frustrations, expressed in his poems to the extent of obscenity
 kabhi kabhi mujhe lagata he ki kaam-vikaron ke adhyayankartaaon ke liye suranjan ek behtareen cese ho sakate hai
 Through which some new man-made infrastructures can be accessed
 jiske gadhan main suranjan ke ekaaki bhatkaav or antaheen sangharsh kii bhoomika rahi he
 Imagine that a young man after a successful couple of years suddenly finds himself alone
 vah yuva jiskaa man romaaniat se bharaa he
 Mukesh and Lata, who see their world in pain-filled nostalgia
 or jo jindagi ko usee romaaniat ke saath jeena chahta he
 Such an emotional person struggles alone with his loneliness, hunger, unemployment, poverty and resourcelessness
 bachapan kii traasad anubhutiyon ke sivaay jiskaa koi ateet nahin he
 Who has no one in the metropolis
 Whoever has the capital, only their feelings and feelings
 Through it, he reaches the capital of the country from far Bihar while searching for the land under his feet
 apni ankhon main anginat sapane lekar
 kuch asafal prem kahaniyon ke saath
 unki smriti main duubataa-utaraata, kancreet ke jangal main bhi uske liye chaiyn kahaan
 gaganchumbi imaaraten aise becharon ko chaaya to detii nahin
 ulte uske bounepan kaa ehsaas karaane lagati hai
 Even after reaching the capital, there is no endless ceasefire
 aise haare-thake vyakti ko kisi ke sahare kii jarurat padati he, stri kaa saath aise hi palon main amritvarsha karata
 paristhitiyon se jujhane kaa samathrya or navajivan detaa
 magar use to vah pehle hi ganvaa chukaa he
 He tried to suppress the daily necessities under the intoxication of alcohol and cannabis
 But was it possible? phir ek-do din kii baat ho to thik
 vahaan to maheenaa-dar-maheenaa varsh-dar-varsh ekaaki kamare kaa vahi suunaapan tha
 Which repeatedly bites the body
 Stings instantly
 Lets taunt
 It took Suranjan 14 years to move from one pair of arms to another
 Sita was with him in Ram's exile
 unke na hone par unka virtv kitna paravaan chadhataa koun kah saktaa he
 How can the wishes not be distorted in such a long interval? The second time, there was support for the arms, but there was no confidence in the mind
 So it is no less that Suranjan is not broken despite battling day and night with such a mess
 Sanjeevani in the form of poetry kept them from shattering
 a poet who is extremely passionate
 satat kaamanaayon main jeeta he
 Dreaming on the go
 jiske paas kavita kii daulat he
 And who has not been disappointed after going through many failed love stories one after the other
 yani jo sapanom main nit nae pyaar ko paravaan chadhate hue dekhtaa he
 How important is the breaking and shattering of dreams for him
 ham log jo saadhaaran bandhaa-bandhaaya sa jivan jite hai
 One cannot think of the horrors of that life
 And if you start imagining, then all the nerves of the brain are going to burst
 parantu suranjan ne inhen apane upar jhela he
 Not a couple days, years, years alone
 Every day sesame and sesame seeds would burn
 The Suranjan we know today has come out in a long struggle and flames of emotion
 uske bheetar angarhpan to he, isliye jab bhi ham suranjan ko alag se jaanane kii koshish karenge, unka jivan maanviya samaj ko kuch na kuch vistaar hi degaa
 suranjan kii pichhali kavitaaon main unke lambey sangharsh or hataashaon kaa vivaran he
 Which has a smooth presentation of sadness and compassion
 ve kavitaayen unhen naiysargik pratibhayukta kavi siddh karne ko paryaapt hai
 But in his recent poems, especially the poems of editor Suranjan, impulsive love has been replaced by fluttering and vulgarity
 nari paatr pehle unki kavitaaon main preranaòt kaa dharm nibhaate the
 But now vulgarity is beginning to be seen in his description
 duniya kii sabase acchhee ladki ko paane kii sanatani kaamana to unke man main aaj bhi he
 But in spite of making the woman whom he calls his wife as a numerologist, there are hundreds of doubts in his mind
 jin kavitaaon main nari paatro ke prati sahaj prem jhalka karata tha, ab unamem patni ke prati naaraazgi or shikaayat kaa bhav rahata he
 The poems which earlier used to preserve tender feelings with great gentleness, nowadays have fluttering and vulgarity
 unki aajkal kii kavitaaon padhakar kabhi-kabhi dimag main khyaal aata he ki kaash, main koi aisa adamkad darpan kaa intjaam kar paata, jisamen se insaan ke antarman kii jhalak saaf-saaf dikhaai de
 us darpan ko main suranjan kii ankhon ke saamne rakhata
 us samay jab vah apni patni ke prati bevajaah gussa dikhaate hai
 Or accuse them in various ways
 us samay main unki ankhon ko ghur-ghur kar padhane kaa prayaas karata, jab ve vikaas or pancham ko saath-saath dekh rahi hotin
 us samay suranjan den to main ek sawaal avashya karata ki pancham ko dekhakar neh se baras-baras padane vaali ankhen vikaas ke prati upeksha se kyon bhari hoti hai? donon main jameen-aasmaan kaa antar kyon he? poochta ki apni kavita main pancham ko baar-baar yaad karne vaale suranjan, uski jindagi kii behatari ke liye din-raat jujhane vaale tathaa uske bhavishya ke prati har pal chintit rahane vaale, suhriday or adarsh pita suranjan, apni duusari or badi santan se munh kyon phere hue he
 Why does a stone become hard as a waxing father development for fifth
 main maanata hum ki ye vyaktigat aarope hai
 There are attempts to interfere in the life of another
 sahitya itnaa vyaktigat hone kii anumati detaa
 ham maan lete hai ki har vyakti kii nijee jindagi hoti he or sahityakar bhi iske apwaad nahin hai
 Unwanted glancing at a person's privacy is not only rude but sinful
 sach maniye yah sab likhte hue main parachhindranveshan kaa lutf uthaane kaa koi iraadaa nahin rakhata
 ye shabd mere liye bhi kam peedaadaayi nahin hai
 But even more, i suffer with poems in which they bring their family and family forcibly
 chunki suranjan ne apni niztaa kaa saarvajaneekaran swayan hi karte hai or garv ke saath karte hai, khud ko pathakon ke bich laakar unki samvednaa lootnaa chaahate hai, to unhen usase uthne vaale prashnon ke liye bhi unhen taiyaar rakhana chahie
 yah sochate hue ki unako to abhivyakti kaa vardaan praapt he
 They can vent their suffering on paper
 utaarte rahete hai
 But the other side is completely silent in this exchange
 isliye ek sahityakar hone ke naate, us paksh ko nyaay or purna abhivyakti dene kaa kaam bhi suranjan kaa hi he
 If he does not do this, then he will continue to be accused of marketing personal sufferings and selling the sympathy and sympathy of others
 People will say back to back if not face to face
 Will remain silent, which will be mere spectacle
 If you leave the mention of Suranjan's pure transparent eyes on the go, then there will be something doable in the mind
 i see thousands of dreams floating in them every moment
 chunki suranjan ke paas beshumaar sapane hai, uski kalpana kii kesar-kyari har pal mahakati rahati he, isliye man main koi baandh nahin rakh paata
 apni samast pidaa, kuntha, kalush or badakaar soch ko kaagaj par utarkar vah nimaily ho jate hai
 This is the characteristic of his uncouth personality
 yahi vah vardaan he, jo kavita ke saath-saath suranjan ko prakruti kii ore se praapt hua he
 And perhaps this is the reason Suranjan expresses his dislike towards her if he is in front, but when he is away, he keeps resting his head repeatedly at the door of memories

 vidyutsakti ko janitrasthal se upyogsthal tak le janaa preshan kehalaata he
 In most places, electric power is produced away from its utilization sites
 vaise to janitrasthal se upyogsthal tak vidyutsakti ko le janaa hi preshan kehalaata he, parantu is shabd k vyaavhaarik arth bahudhaa duuri tathaa ucch boltata se sambandhit he
 The transmission lines are superimposed on poles or minarets, also as overhead lines and also as underground cables
 upree line saadharantaya taanbe ke taar kii hoti hai, parantu aluminium tathaa ispaat or aluminium ke sanyukt chaalak bhi vistrut rup se prayukt kiye jate hai
 In most places, electric power is produced away from its utilization sites
 janitrasthalon kii sthapana, vastut:, sadhano kii uplabdhi tathaa aarthik auchity ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 There is no question of making hydroelectricities in a specific place, because their location depends on natural resources which are usually far from densely populated areas
 tapiya bijligharon kii sthapana bhi bhaarakentre ke saath-saath koyale kii uplabdhi tathaa iske parivahan kii samasya par nirbhar karti he
 Hence, the distance of the generator places can be several hundred miles by weight and in such cases the power has to be carried by the transmission lines to the load
 atev preshan bhi vidyut udyog kaa utana hi mukhya or mahatvapurn ang he jitna swayan vidyutsakti kaa utpaadan
 While the transmission of electric power from the generator to the user site is called transmission, the practical meaning of the term is often related to distance and high bolt
 preshan line pole athwa minaaron par aropit, upree linon ke rup main bhi tathaa bhumigat cabilon ke rup main bhi hoti hai
 The upper lines are usually made of copper wire, but aluminum and steel and aluminum composite conductors are also widely used
 upree line bhumigat se kam se kam 20 foot kii oonchaai par honi chahie or inkaa koi bhi bhaag isse kam oonchaai par nahin hona chahie
 Their height from the ground is even higher in case of high voltage
 atev ye line polon par le jaai jaati hai or porcylen ke vidyutrodhiyon par aropit hoti hai
 The lines of thicker conductors, which transmit more power, are diverted to larger towers in place of poles, which are made of different shapes according to the driver number and the forces applied to them
 vidyutarodhi bhi vibhinn prarupon ke hote hai or mukhyat: apni sthiti tathaa voltata ke anusaar vibhinn virgon ke hote hai
 Thus the insulators range from low voltage of 440 volts to 11 kilovolts, 33 kilovolts, 66 kilovolts, etc
 and are of an insulated shackle, pin, disc and suspension type depending on the condition used in different situations
 vidyutarodhi saadharantaya pole par kanchi main lage hote hai or is prakaar vinyasit hote hai ki kisi bhi dasha main chaalak jhulakar, duusare chaalak se, athwa pole, athwa uske kisi bhi sanrachana anshak se na chhu jaaen
 Their shape and composition are also such that under any circumstances, it is possible to maintain the conductor between the conductor and any structural fraction of the pole
 cabile, vastut:, kisi bhi vidyutarodhi chaalak ko kaha ja saktaa he, parantu vidyut ke preshan main prayukt honevaale cabile kaa upyog mukhyat: bhoomi ke andar hota he
 Therefore, the composition of cables is also such that they can be protected from the influences falling under the ground
 saamanyat: preshan cabile trikleey hote hai
 Therefore, there are at least three cores in them, which are electrically isolated and then they are also insulated from the top
 yah vidyutrodhi, saadharantaya, vyaapt kaagaj, athwa rui kii tepe kaa hota he, jo cabile kii kaaryakari voltata ke varg par nirbhar karata he
 The conductor core and dielectric lead are incorporated into the lead pipe, which does not allow moisture to enter, so that the insulator does not deteriorate
 is nalee ko yantric haani se bachaan ke liye jute kaa feeta diya jaataa he or upar se lohe kii pattee kaa kavach chadha diya jaataa
 For this reason, they are also called poetic cables
 ati ucch voltata preshan ke cabile, tel se bhare cabile bhi hote hai
 Oil is, in effect, the best dielectric medium
 parantu aise cabilon kii banaavat kaaphi jatil hoti he or inaki dekhbhaal bhi kathin hoti he
 Due to this their use is limited
 vidyutpreshan kii mitvyayita bahut seemaa tak chaalak ke aakaar par nirbhar karti he
 The size of the driver mainly depends on the carrying current
 kisi nirdhaarit shakti ke liye vahan kii janevaali dhara, mukhyat: voltata par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, it is only appropriate to use the highest voltage for transmission so that the current flowing through it can be reduced for that power and small size conductors can be used
 parantu ucchtam voltata kii bhi apni seemayen hai
 At voltages greater than 36 km, the size of the conductor depends not only on the magnitude of the current, but in fact, the effect of the korana
 corona ucch volttaaon par chaalak ke aasapaas kii vaayu ke ayanit hone kaa prabhaav hota he
 Due to this, the sound and brightness of Him Him is produced and it finally manifests as a power loss
 is kaaran chaalak ke aakaar kaa abhikalp is shakti haani tathaa uske prabhaavon ko drushti main rakhte hue karnaa hota he
 Interference of transmission lines at high voltages to communication lines is another important problem
 ucch voltata preshan karne vaali line samipsth sanchaar linon main ek vyatikaran voltata prerit kar detii hai, jiske kaaran sanchaar main gadabadi hoti he, par yah vyatikaran, sanchaar linon kii vidyut linon se dur rakhkar, kam kiya ja saktaa he tathaa duusare bhi bahut se upachaar kiye ja sakate hai
 The third difficulty is the proper structure of high voltage conductors and towers, so that faulty conditions do not arise
 saath hi saath unki uchit dekhbhaal bhi ek samasya ban jaati he
 In addition, power stability is a significant problem at the highest voltages
 ati ucch voltata kii lambii linon main, shaktipravaah, vastut:, shakti sthayitv dwaara simit hota he
 Because of this the rated power can only be transmitted to a specific distance at a specific voltage
 saath hi saath preshit shakti tathaa duuri ke anusaar ek vishisht voltata par preshan hi sabase adhik mitavyayi ho saktaa he
 These problems are very important in big plans and design of dispatch system is a major part of the plan
 preshnatantr kii yojana kaa aadhaar bhaar surveykshan hota he
 First the proposed load is calculated in different places and then according to them the position of the sub-centers is determined
 bhaar tathaa duuri ke anusaar preshan kii voltata tathaa paripath kii sankhya nishchit kii jaati he or prastaavit linon kaa path nishchit kiya jaataa he
 The form and design of line design, the type of insulation and the mechanism of their installation and protection mechanism is the most important economic aspect for any scheme
 preshnatantr kaa safal abhikalp bhi aarthik pahalu sabase mahatvapurn hota he
 Successful design of a remittance system also depends on economic criteria
 kisi nirdhaarit shakti ke preshan ke teen mukhya sanghatak he : shakti, duuri tathaa voltata
 Successful design of any remittance scheme depends on the appropriate coordination of these three components
 line abhikalp kii disha main mahatvapurn shodh ho rahe hai, jinke parinamswaroop ab vidyutrodhon ke str ko utana unchaa nahin rakhaa jaataa jitna 10 varsh pehle rakhaa jaataa tha
 In this way huge savings in the value of lines have been possible
 atyucch voltata kaa preshan, saadharantaya, 100 mile se adhik kii duuri ke liye hi kiya jaataa he
 Often dispatch has to be done in two order
 atyucch voltata par preshan saadharantaya bijlighar ke upakentre se upyogkshetra ke bhar centre ke nearesth upakedron tak kiya jaataa he, jahaan se kisi madhyam voltata par upyogsthal ke upakentre tak shakti kar preshan kiya jaataa he
 Thus it is called as primary and secondary dispatch
 antim upakentre se bhaar tak vitarak athwa sambharan line le jaai jaati hai, jahaan se vyaktigat bhaaron kaa sambharan kiya jaataa he
 To transmit the generated voltages normally, transforms to very high voltages
 atev parinamit bhi preshnatantr ke mahatvapurn ang hote hai
 In addition to this, many protection devices and circuit trots are also a specific part of the system
 parinamitra ke donon ore tel paripath trot kii vyavastha rahati he, jisase parinamitra ke donon ore kaa paripath kholaa ja sake
 Similarly, there is a provision to disable any line or its division, so that the line can be maintained in case of defect
 vastut: sangrakshan yuktiyaan dosha kii sthiti main doshi prabhag ko apane aap kholkar alag kar detii he
 Several types of relays are used in the sub-station for line protection
 based saamaanya riley atibhaar riley or bhoomi ksharan riley hai
 Overload relays, in the event of overload, open the circuit by introducing a circuit trotter and thus protect the line and its associated damage from overload damage or harmful effects
 bhoomi ksharan riley bhumidosh kii avasthaa main kaary karte hai or doshi line ko yojit kar dete hai
 There are many different types of relays used
 bahut se riley dosha kii duuri kaa vyavastha ke aadhaar par kaary karte hai or bahut se ek pilot taar kaa prayog karte hai, tathaapi aadhuniktam sangrakshan tantra karier sangrakshan tantra he
 The carrier is, in effect, a high-frequency wave, which is impeded on the pilot wires along with the power frequency
 dosha kii sthiti main usase sanyojit riley tatkshan kaary kar, line ko viyojit kar dete hai
 The carrier protection mechanism is more rapid and more reliable than other systems
 parantu yah keval ucch voltata linon ke liye hi aarthik rup se uchit ho saktaa he
 Provision of lightning protection is also very important in the design of transmission lines
 tadit line par girakar use tathaa usase sanyojit sabhi saajasja ko nasht kar sakati he
 To avoid this, many tips are used, mainly the provision of ground wires and lightning resistant
 bhoomi taar saamaanya rup se line ko tadit ke hanikaarak prabhaavon se bachaata he or tadit ko line par yathasambhav girane se roktaa he
 Lightning plugs are placed on the sub-center or end structures and when the lightning falls on the line, it is directly positioned, so as not to damage the line or decoration
 sabhi minar thik se bhooyojit hote hai or unka bhoomirodh vividh prakaar kii vyavasthaayen karke atyant kam rakhaa jaataa he
 From the point of view of preservation, more class dielectric also has to be used, but nowadays there is no need to keep the level of dielectric high due to research on lightning prevention
 preshantantron ko bahudhaa grid ke rup main antarbandhit kar dete hai, jisase grid ke andar shakti kaa swatantraapurvak pravaah ho sake
 Such grids operate at very high voltages and the voltage and frequency of the entire system is the same
 isamen niyantran kii kathinaaiyaan to avashya hi bad jaati hai, parantu tantra main kisi bhi sthaan kii phaltu shakti duusare sthanon par, jahaan uski aavashyaktaa ho, prayukt kii ja sakati he
 Thus, it is no longer necessary to keep additional installed power in power stations
 vastut:, bade gridon main kisi ek bijlighar, athwa mashin, kii shakti sampurna tantra kii shakti kii tulana main naganya hoti he or sampurna tantra ke kaary ko vishesh rup se prabhavit nahin kar paati
 There are many such grids in India too, such as Bhakra Grid, Ganga Hydroelectric Grid, Sharda Grid, DVC Grid, Hirakud Grid, Madras Grid, Bombay Grid etc
 sabhi badi badi yojanaayen grid ke rup main hai
 Now all these grids are being tied up and the outline of the All India Grid is being made, which is probably 350 kv
 Or even higher voltage

 Dr
 Sharda was impressed by Dr
 Ambedkar's stunning personality
 pehali mulaakaat main hi unhen mahasoos hua ki dow ambedkar koi maamuli vyakti na hokar ek asaadhaaran or mahaan hasti the
 In this first meeting, Ambedkar questioned Apnatta about Kabir
 iskaa kaaran tha ki ve mahilaon kii unnati ke bare main kaam kar rahe the
 Ambedkar greeted him
 isi mulaaqaat main buddha dharm ke bare main bhi charchaa hui
 In this way, Dr
 Ambedkar and Sharda ji first met here at Dr
 Rao's house

 In this way, the round of meetings progressed
 baad main patr vyavhaar bhi hua
 And Ambedkar had a good acquaintance with him
 sahitya, samaaj, dharm aadi vishyon par baatcheet hoti thi
 Sometimes there was debate

 Then he would say his words

 There should be someone to take care of their health

 And both decided to get married

 But Ambedkar affectionately called him 'sharu' with the old name, which was a synonym of the word Sharda
 ek duusare ke vichaaron ko to ve pehle se hi jaanate the
 Since that point, she has been with Babasaheb Ambedkar as a shadow, being a wife and a colleague
 unke vivaah se brahman or dalit donon samudaayon ke anek log kupit hue
 Many Brahmins questioned Ambedkar's Dalit politics and ideology
 daliton ke ek varg ne kaha ki isse galat to kuch ho hi nahin saktaa tha
 Did Babasaheb get a Brahmin woman for marriage? kaiyon ne ise brahmanon kii sajeesh kaha
 Some even ridiculed
 kintu ambedkar ke bahut se anuyaayiyon ne mana ki vah jo karte hai, sochsamajh kar karte hai, zyada vichaarvaan or samajhadaar hai, isliye unhone uchit hi kiya hoga
 After marriage, Dr

 Ambedkar's health was constantly deteriorating

 After this Dr
 Ambedkar himself initiated the Buddhist Dhamma by giving Trisharan, Panchsheel and twenty-two vows to his 5,00,000 followers
 yah shapathgrahan subah 9 baje hua
 Savita Ambedkar became the first woman to accept the Buddhist Dhamma of this Dharmantar movement
 dilli ke 26, alipur road, jahaan ambedkar rahe, vahaan log badi sankhya main unase milane aate the
 It was not possible and necessary that Ambedkar meet everyone
 kyonki ambedkar tab bimaar rahete
 Therefore every second-third person used to be angry and he used to blame Savita ji for this
 unase bhi adhik unki jati ko
 From one second to the other third, this is where the talk used to end and that too
 yani ek brahmani ne babasaheb ko apane changul main rakhaa hua he
 Whereas, apart from a wife, the doctor also had double responsibility on Savita ji

 After the 1994 general election, when the ANC emerged as the governing party and lost the province of kwazulu-natal to the IFP, he was appointed a member of the Executive Committee for Economic Affairs and Tourism of the kwazulu-natal Provincial Government, Before which he withdrew his candidature and made Thabo Mbeki's claim for the vice-president uncontested

 President Thabo Mbeki freed Zuma from the post of Vice President on 14 June 2005 due to corruption charges leveled against him by the South African government in 1999 in a $ 5 billion arms procurement deal

 The party formation held a nomination conference in October and November 2007, with Zuma being the most preferred name for the ANC president, and by implication he was also wanted for the 2009 President of South Africa

 In September 2008, the ANC "recalled" Thabo Mbeki from the country's presidency and announced that the party's vice president, Kagalema Motlanthe, would remain acting president until the 2009 general elections, and Zuma would be the new president thereafter

 In defense of the beginner of this phrase, Zuma is actually mentioned 471 times in the entire transcript of the judgment against Shack, the word "corrupt" or "corruption" has been used 54 times and contains 12 sentences containing Both the words "corrupt" and "zuma" are used together

 On 8 November 2007, the Supreme Court of Appeal pronounced its judgment in favor of the National Prosecuting Authority in connection with various search and seizure operations carried out by Zuma's defense team and four appeals dismissed by them

 On 4 August 2008, Zuma appeared in court
 On 12 September 2008, Pietermaritzburg Judge Chris Nicholson stated that the corruption charges against Zuma were illegal on procedural grounds because the National Directorate of Public Prosecutions did not give Zuma the opportunity to submit a representation before deciding to press charges and pay the state legal
 Instructed to do
 nikholson ne yah bhi kaha ki, unka maananaa tha ki raajnneetik hastkshep ne zuma ke khilaaf punah aarope daayar karne ke nirnay main ek bhoomika nibhaai, yadhyapi unhone yah nahin bataaya ki kyon unhone zuma par lage aaropon ko avaidh bataaya
 Nikholson also emphasized that his decision was not related to Zuma's guilt or guilt, but was only on a procedural basis
 vibhinn media reporton ne yah galat soochna di ki zuma ke khilaaf aarope khaarij kar die gaye hai
 This was not the case
 NDPP, zuma par punah aarope lagane main sakasham bana hua tha, haalanki, sirf ek hi baar unhen NDPP ke samaksh abhyavedan prastut karne kaa mauka diya gaya wo bhi NDPP ke aisa karne ke nirnay ke aadhaar par
 nirnay ke 47 paragraph main, nyaayadhish nikholson ne likhaa, The compulsion to listen to representations is a part of the principle of audi alteram partem
 aavashyaktaa yah he ki ek vyakti jo ho saktaa he ki ek nirnay ke kaaran pratikul rup se prabhavit ho rahaa he, use ek anukool parinaam praapt karne kii drushti se ek abhyavedan prastut karne kaa avasar diya janaa chahie
 prabhavit vyakti ko aamtaur par us maamle ke saar yaa tatwon ke vishay main suchit kiya janaa chahie, jis par use jawaab dena he
 The court determined that the ndpp's failure to follow the procedure outlined in section 179 of the constitution invalidated the ndpp's decision to re-charge Zuma
 nyaayadhish nikholson ne paaya ki zuma par lagaae gaye aaropon ke samay par vibhinn anumaan lagaae ja sakate hai jo is nishkarsh kii pushti karata he ki isamen sarkaar kii kaaryakari shakha dwaara raajnneetik hastkshep kaa kuch ansh shaamil he
 Judge Nicholson writes in paragraph 210 of his decision, raashtrapati kii polokavane main hui raajnneetik haar ke baad, 28 disambar 2007 ko shriman emse dwaara chalaae gaye abhiyog kaa samay, sabase adhik durbhagyapurna tha
 This aspect, combined with the incident of Mr
 Piccoli who should have been independent and immune to the suspension of executive intervention, convinced me that the most true conclusion is that the damaging political influence continues
 nirnay ke anuchhed 220 main nyaayadhish nikholson ne aage likhaa he, There is a worrying structure in the behaviors i have set out above signs of political interference, pressure or influence
 yah mantri maduna dwaara shri ngakuka ko die gaye "raajnneetik netritv" se shuru hua, jab unhone aavedak par mukadmaa chalaane se inkaar kar diya, jiskaa aparaadh tha unka thint pratinidhiyon se vaarta karnaa or milanaa or anya maamle jiskaa ullekh main kar chukaa hum
 sakshya ke niyam die jane ke kaaran adaalat is nishkarsh ko sweekaar karne ke liye baadhya he jo us paksh ke hit ke liye sabase kam anukool he jinke paas tathyon kaa vishesh gyaan he
 This is certainly more prevalent than the political interference of "clues or suggestions" mentioned in the Yengeni case
 yah ek gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he ki is tarah kii prakriya, nae dakshin africa main ghatit hui or isane rangabhed shashan ke antargat vinaash ko prerit kiya
 " sunwaayee se pehle zuma ke samarthakon kii ore se dakshin africa nyaaypalika kii khub aalochana kii gai
 In this context, the irony was that the South African judiciary was found in favor of Zuma for the third time, including acquittal of the rape charges leveled against him
 NDPP ne jald hi is nirnay ke khilaaf apil karne ke apane iraade kii ghoshnaa kii
 Thabo Mbeki filed an affidavit in the Constitutional Court to appeal the decision of Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Chris Nicholson: mujhase sambandhit aise doorgaami "afasosjanak, pariwadaatmak or pratikul" nishkarsh nikalnaa or zuma maamle ke un nishkarshon ke aadhaar par faisla karnaa or ninda karnaa adaalat ke liye anuchit tha
 My absolute request is that the defense of the interests of justice is in improving the matter
 in pratikul nishkarshon ne mere ANC party dwaara meraa naam waapas liye jane ko falit kiya - yah ek aisa nivedan tha jise maine pichley 52 varshon se ANC kaa ek patibaddh or vafaadaar sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 i am afraid that if not rectified, i may face further adverse effects
 rashtriya abhiyog praadhikaran ke pravaktaa, talaali talaali, ne 23 sitambar ko pretoria se phone dwaara kaha, "hame kagajaat mil gaya he

 pehla pahalu tha ki kya zuma ko is baat kaa adhikaar tha ki ve NPA ke samaksh abhyavedan karne ke liye aamantrit kiye jaayen wo bhi unke khilaaf rishwat or bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko waapas liye jane kaa nirnay liye jane se pehle
 doosraa pahalu yah tha ki kya nyaayadhish nikholson zuma par ilzaam lagaae jane ke NPA ke nirnay ke sandarbh main tatkaaleen raashtrapati thabo mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ko samajhane main sahi the
 On the question of inviting representations during the review of the npa's decision, Harms DP found that the interpretation of section 179 of the Constitution given by Nicholson was incorrect because the NPA had no such obligation and was therefore free to accuse Zuma, He has done
 nikholson ke mabek dwaara die gaye raajnneetik dakhal ke vishay main die gaye tark ke sawaal par, harms deepi ne paaya ki "nichali adaalat ne apane adhikaron kaa ulanghan kiya he"
 On 6 April 2009, the National Prosecuting Authority, in light of the new revelation of serious flaws in the prosecution, withdrew all charges against Zuma and co-accused French arms company Thint
 yah rahasyodghatan phone vaarta ke tukdon ke rup main the jo yah dikhaate the ki scorpian ke adhyaksh, lionard maikaarthi or saarvajanik abhiyojan ke purv rashtriya nideshak, bulilani ngakuka ne zuma par abhiyog chalaae jane ke samay ko lekar saazish rachi thi, jo sambhavyatah zuma ke raajnneetik pratidwandvi, raashtrapati thabo mabek ke raajnneetik laabh ke liye tha
 The withdrawal of the charge was announced by the acting president of the NPA, Mokothedi Empshe, who insisted that the withdrawal of the charges was due to abuses that made the legal process "tainted" and not equal to acquittal
 NPA kii ghoshnaa ke turant baad, haalanki, kam se kam do raajnneetik dalon ne suchit kiya ki aaropon ko waapas liye jane kii sthiti main ve apane se kanoonee karrwai par vichaar karenge
 The Democratic Alliance later filed an appeal for a judicial review of the npa's decision, with reference to his party leader Helen Zilla clarifying that Ampshey "did not make decisions based on the law, but was bound by political pressure" 
 On 9 June 2009, the day of hearing of the case was fixed
 jabaki zuma ne apni pratikriya ko kalochit rup se daayar kiya, ampshe ne maamle kii sunwaayee main deree kii, jisamen unhone NPA kii pratikriya ko pesh karne ke liye do vistaaran kaa anurodh kiya
 NPA spokesman Muthunzi Mahaga said they would not file papers because there are "outstanding cases" that are yet to be resolved
 democratic elliance party pramukh jile ne tark diya ki zuma kii pratikriya moulik rup se galat he or "unamem koi sanvaidhanik aadhaar nahin hai"
 jabaki kanoonee chunautiyaan jari rahi, june 2009 ko hue ek surveykshan se pataa chalaa ki, aadhe se zyada dakshin africa yah maanate hai ki raashtrapati jacob zuma acha kaam kar rahe hai
 The poll conducted by TNS Research Studies in late June 2009 showed that Zuma's approval level had steadily improved
 surveykshan main shaamil logon main se lagbhag 57% ne kaha ki ve sochate hai ki zuma ek sakasham netaa hai - yah taadaad april 2009 main raashtrapati ke naam udghaatan ke mukaable 3% tak adhik thi
 In November 2008, just a few months after former President Thabo Mbeki was withdrawn and Zuma faced corruption charges, only 36% of South Africans were positive about him
 disambar 2005 main, zuma par apane forest toun, johanesburg vaale ghar main ek 31 varshiya mahila kaa balaatkaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 The alleged victim belonged to an important ANC family, was the daughter of a close associate of Zuma's struggle days and was an AIDS activist believed to be HIV positive
 zuma ne in aaropon kaa khandan kiya or daawa kiya ki yah yon sambandh aapasi sahmati se bana tha
 Even before the charges were filed, as rumors about rape allegations erupted in November, Zuma's political prospects seemed to be on the decline
 unke ucch str ke adhikansh raajnneetik samarthakon ne in nae aaropon ke sandarbh main us tarah se pratikriya nahin di jis tarah se unhone bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke khilaaf di thi
 In a hearing before the rape trial, crowds of thousands of his supporters gathered before the court, while small anti-rape groups demonstrated for the alleged rape victim
 jaise kii zuma ne mukademe ke dauraan kiya, ve bheed ke saath lethu masini vami gaate rahe or ANC yuva lig or balm panthi party yuva lig ke pravaktaa ne zuma ke samarthan main baat kii
 As the rape trial progressed, reports surfaced that the South African left wing contingent differed on how to address Zuma's case and the sacp's relationship with him
 Many members of the party's youth wing supported Zuma while other members of the SACP were skeptical about the value of performing for a particular person against important principles of governance
 kuch purv samarthakon ke dalbadal lene ke baavjood, kai zuma samarthakon ne adaalat ke baahar pradarshan karnaa jari rakhaa, abhiyokta kii akhandta or naitikta par nirantar pratighaat karne, abhiyokta ke ek kareebi dost par apshabd oochhaalane or abhiyokta samaj kar kisi anya mahila par pathar phenkane jaise krityon ne balaatkaar virdohi samoohon kii aalochana ko badhaava diya
 Zuma's defense team presented evidence relating to the victim's sexual past and insisted that the physical relationship was with both consent
 abhiyojan paksh ne is baat par jor diya ki us mahila kaa pratirodh naa karnaa uske sadame kii sthiti main hone ke kaaran tha or un donon ke bich kaa sambandh pita putree ke sambandh jaisaa tha
 The lawsuit also sparked a political controversy when Zuma, who at the time was heading the National AIDS Council, admitted that he had unprotected sexual intercourse with a woman accused of rape, knowing that Also that she was HIV positive
 unhone adaalat main yah kaha ki "HIV sankraman ke khatre ko kam karne ke liye" uske turant baad unhone snaan kar liya
 The statement was condemned by the judge, health experts and AIDS activists
 dakshin africa kii lokapriy comic strip, madam or eve or jane maane raajnneetik cartoonist zapiro ne is maamle kaa mazaaq udaaya
 HIV kii shiksha dene waalon ne jor diya ki yah HIV sankraman ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kar paayegaa
 On 8 May 2006, the court found Zuma innocent and Zuma agreed that the sexual act surrounded by the questions was consensual
 nyaayadhish vine dar marave ne abhiyokta ko adaalat main jhooth bolne ke liye buree tarah se fatkaaraa, lekin zuma ko bhi apni laaparvaahee ke liye doshi tehraaya
 When his rape case ended, many South Africans wondered how to fill the gaps created by Zuma's trial in his political system
 An analysis by Mel & Guardian described these incidents as particularly disturbing: phir bhi, balaatkaar mukademe ke khatm ho jane ke baad, bijness de kii krima brown ne di gargian ko bataaya "jacob zuma waapas aa gaye hai
 This poses a serious dilemma for the ANC leadership

 This is a major victory for Zuma's political career
 " The prospect of Zuma's return as a contender for the presidency became a cause for concern for international investors
 ek swatantra vishleshak ne suzav diya, "haalia surveykshanon ke anusaar, zuma or unke mashin gan chalaanevaale kafile ko union building kii ore badate hue dekhnaa mukhyatah madhyam varg or vyapaariyon ko hatotsahit karne vaala he

 kai antarrashtriya paryvekshakon ne iskaa swaagat ek spasht sanket ke rup main kiya ki dakshin africa sarkaar apane bhitari rankon se bhrashtachar ko ukhaad fankne ke liye samarpit he
 On the other hand, some people in South Africa highlighted the fact that Zuma and Mbeki represent two different constituencies in the African National Congress
 kuch vampanthi samarthakon ne daawa kiya ki mabek or unka bazaar-unmukhi paksh ANC main apana varchasv kaayam rakhane ke uddheshy se zuma ko baahar nikalne kii sajeesh kar rahaa hai

 On the next court date in November, thousands of Zuma supporters gathered to support him; Zuma addressed the Durban crowd in the Zulu language and appealed to them to maintain the unity of the party and sang the song Lethu Machines Vami of the apartheid struggle, which literally translates to the words "meri machine me la" It is understood in the context of machine guns

 While at least a partial of his political power is based on inter-party relations, one analyst argued that his supporters' loyalty had its roots in the Zulu approach to loyalty and mutual aid

 However, the Balm section of the party and additional party organizations such as the ANC Youth League, South African Balm Panthi Party and South African Trade Union Congress have advocated a strong stand on Zimbabwe

 Zuma's stance on Zimbabwe was mixed
 2006 main german patrika der spigel ko die ek saakshaatkaar main, unhone mugabe ke prati bhaavnaatmak sahanubhuti vyakt karte hue kaha ki "europea aksar is tathy kii andekhi karte hai ki mugabe africaiyon ke bich bahut lokapriy hai
 In his eyes, he got the blacks back to their country after centuries of colonialism
 "he added that" people love them, so how can we condemn them? Many in Africa believe that there is a racist aspect in the criticism of Mugabe by Europeans and Americans
 angola, congou ganraajya or rwanda main lakhon ashwet maare gaye
 Western countries have already become dissatisfied due to the unfortunate death of some Europeans in Zimbabwe
 " However, until December 2007, he was more forthright in criticizing the leadership of Zimbabwe, under which he defined his policies in more contrast with Mbeki's policies: yah or bhi dukhad he ki anya vishwa ke anya netaaon jinhonen daman dekha he yah bahaanaa karte hai ki aisa kabhi hua hi nahin, yaa yah atishyoktipurna he
 When history finally discusses the dictators, then those who stand by the side and see the spectacle should also bear the consequences
 a shameful quality of the modern world is to look back on injustice and ignore the difficulties of others

 Zuma appointed Advocate Jurg Prinsloo, a former Conservative Party MP, as well as Vicliffe Mothuloe, to deal with his so-called "crucifixion by the media"

 main use maar kar gira detaa
" The Joint Working Group questioned Zuma's leadership skills and said that a "true leader reigns with wisdom and wisdom - not by popularity or favor
 To lead such a narrow minded person to lead our nation" How can i expect? "zuma later apologized to everyone he offended by his statement, saying," i belong to those gay brothers and sisters

 Stalinism is largely the set of policies adopted by Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union to build a communist society
 rus main hui bolshevik kranti or uske netaa lenin kii mrityu ke baad teen dashakon main dhire-dhire ek raajnneetik parighatna ke rup main iskaa vikaas hua
 Since the life of Joseph Stalin, who was the head of the Soviet Communist Party between 1927 and 1956, some intellectuals had made a weak attempt to formulate a new ideology called marxism-leninism-stalinism
 isaki misaal disambar, 1934 ke pravada main prakashit karl radek ke ek lekh ke rup main milti he
 But this attitude was neither encouraged by Stalin nor other Soviet Communist Party theorists
 phir bhi is parighatna ke centre main maujuud stallin kii bauddhik or raajnneetik shakhsiyat ke kaaran ise stallinavaad kaa naam mil gaya
 This can be understood in two ways: as a project of building thirty years of socialism under the leadership of Stalin in the Soviet Union and ideological and organizational tendencies that emerged from this period which have given the Marxist politics all over the world Influenced as

 In this context, the Marxists of the whole world are divided into three parts: one is the one who fully accepts Stalinism and declares it as the main practical form of Marxism, the second part is the dismissive distortion of Marxist experiment by rejecting it completely
 And the third part is that which, despite considering the influence of Stalinism as generally persuasive and positive, some of its The criticism of Hluon

 His theoretical writing was characterized by a very simple expression which made him well-liked among the workers
 stallin mukhya rup se vishwa-kranti ke bina hi ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana ke siddhant ke liye jane jate hai
 From 1924 onwards, Stalin wrote and analyzed writing to reinforce his argument

 The communist power established as a result of the Bolshevik Revolution consisted of two conflicting dimensions

 This form of democracy seemed better and radical than the market-based liberal democracy that was developing in Western countries

 Names in this list meant that the person would be controlled by the party system, the party would remove it, promote it or be marginalized whenever they wanted
