 In his famous experiments used to drop balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later rotate the inclusions with careful measurement of the balls, Galileo showed that the gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects
 yah arestu ke vishwaas se ek bada prasthaan tha ki baari vastuon main ucch gurutvkarshan twaran hota he
 Galileo cited wind resistance as the reason that low-mass objects could fall into the atmosphere at a slower rate
 galileo ke kaam ne newton ke gurutv ke siddhant ke nirmaan ke liye manch taiyaar kiya Then Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the inverse square law of gravity
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The relation of the working force f between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravity constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on an object can be calculated
 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects
 apane is nishkarsh kii pushti usne prayogon or ganitiya vivechanon dwaara kii he
 German astronomer Kepler gave three laws by studying the motion of planets
 kepler kaa pratham niyam: -sabhi grah surya ke chaaron ore dirghavrittakar kakshaon me chakkar lagate hai tathaa surya un kakshaon ke focus par hota he
 Second law - The line joining any planet to the Sun crosses the same area at the same time
 arthath prayek grah kii kshetreey chaal niyat rahati he
 That is, when the planet is away from the Sun, its speed decreases
 tritiy niyam : - prayek grah kaa surya kaa parikraman kaal kaa varg uski deergh vrittakar kaksha kii ardh-deergh aksh kii tritiy ghaat ke samaanupati hota he
 Gravity: "father, this earth, on which we dwell, rests upon?" Lilavati asked this question to her father Bhaskaracharya centuries ago
 iske uttar main bhaskaracharya ne kaha, "baale leelavati !, kuch log jo yah kehete hai ki yah prithvi sheshnag, kachua yaa hathi yaa anya kisi vastu par aadhaarit he to ve galat kehete hai
 Even if it is assumed that it rests on an object, the question remains, on which that object rests, and thus the cause of the cause and then its cause


 This sequence continues, then in jurisprudence This is called non-permanent defect
 leelavati ne kaha phir bhi yah prashn bana rahata he pitaaji ki prithvi kis cheez par tiki he? Then Bhaskaracharya said, why we cannot assume that the earth is not based on anything
 xxrep 5 
 yadi ham yah kahen ki prithvi apane hi bal se tiki he or ise gurutvkarshan shakti kah den to kya dosha he? Lilavati asked how this is possible
 tab bhaskaracharya siddhanth kii baat kehete hai ki vastuon kii shakti badi vicitra he
 Next says arthath prithvi main aakarshan shakti he
 Earth attracts heavy substances with its attraction power and due to attraction they fall to the ground
 par jab akaash main samaan takat chaaron ore se lage, to koi kaise gire? arthath akaash main grah niravlamb rahete hai kyonki vividh grahon kii gurutv shaktiyaan santulan banaae rakhti hai

 Neuroptera is a class of insects falling under the insecta category
 is varg ke keet chote se lekar kuch bade aakaar ke komal sharirdhari hai, jinamein praaia: asaadhaaran lambii shrigikaaye, kaatane ke anukool mukhang, avibhajit yaa dwipindi yaa praaia: ksheen ligula tathaa bilkul samaan aakaar ke or do jode jhillidaar pankh hote hai
 When the insect is seated, both pairs of feathers are situated like the roof above the abdomen
 shirayen aadya dhang kii hoti hai, kintu unamem anek sahaayak shirayen tathaa anek sookshm parshu shirayen hoti hai, udar praaia: anulaag viheen hota he
 Larvae are carnivorous
 larvon kii taangen bhalee bhanti viksit or sharir chauras hota he tathaa mukhang kaatane or chooshak prakaar ke hote hai
 Aquatic neuroptera have ventral water gills
 pupe swatantra kriyasheel hote hai tathaa pankhons main purna shwasanalikaay hoti hai
 All insects in the Neuroptera category have very low flying power
 ye komalang kiton kaa bhakshan karte hai athwa madhuras par jivan nirvaah karte hai
 Their larvae are of diverse composition and nature, but they are all carnivorous
 kuch ine gine spishiz jaleey hote hai
 One of the characteristics of aquatic species is that there are accumulated abdominal amplifications in each of their abdominal segments
 neuroptera varg do upvargon megaloptera or planipenia main vibhajit he
 More than 4,300 species of this class have been studied
 is upvarg ke kiton main pankhons ke kinare kii shiraaon main do main bantne kii pravriti aspasht hoti he
 Mukhangs of larvae tend to bite
 megaloptera upvarg do pramukh pariwaron main vibhajit he - There are only a few lineages and castes under this family, which are spread all over the world
 ye anya neuroptera se is baat main bhinn hai ki inke pichley pankh jad ke paas chaude hote hai or jab ye udate nahin hote tab gudiy kshetra pankhe kii bhanti failaa hota he
 Pests of this family lay eggs on leaves, rocks or other objects near water
 sialis ke prayek dher main 200-500 andey hote hai or koridalis main 200-300 tak andey hote hai
 The eggs are cylindrical and thick brown in color
 larve andon se nikalakar jal main pravesh kar jate hai
 Lions of Cialis are found in the slippery floor of the pond, canal or slow stream, but the larvae of Corydalis are hidden under the stones of the velocity stream
 is parivaar ke sabhi larve shikari hote hai or anya jati ke kiton ke larven ore krimiyon ityadi par jeevanyaapan karte hai
 In the pupa stage, the corridalis goes down several inches in the ground or moss etc
 and comes out of the ground or moss as an adult
 inkaa puraa jeevanchakra ek saal kaa hota he
 Corydalis is found in North America and Asia
 is parivaar ke antargat megaloptera ke sabhi vishisht thalchar sadsy aate hai yah keet parivaar austrailia ko chhodkar sabhi mahadeshon main paaya jaataa he
 More than 80 species of this family are known
 rafididi parivaar ke keet junglee kshetron main, phool or vriksh ke tanon ityadi par paae jate hai
 The eggs are penetrated into the cracks of the bark of the tree by a long detector
 larve dhili chhaalon visheshat: conifer main paae jate hai
 They are very hungry and hunt the insects with soft body
 pupa ek prakaar kii kholi band rahata he or kuch samay ke uparaant kriyasheel hokar tivrata se tab tak rengta rahata he, jab tak vishram karne ke liye koi upyukt sthaan nahin uplabdh ho jaataa or vayask hone tak yah vahiin rahata he
 Snake flies are an example of this
 iske antargat aanevaale kiton main paron ke kinare kii shiraaon ke do virgon main bantne kii pravriti spasht hoti he
 Mukhangs of larvae are juvenile in nature
 is upvarg ke udhaaharan les wing or cheentee vyaadh hai
 Most neuroptera come under plenipenia
 praaia: samast planipenia thalchar keet hai
 Some of these larvae are almost amphibious in stages and one or two lineages are actually aquatic
 planipenia ke larva vyapak rup se shikari hote hai or ye afid tathaa anya kshatikaarak kiton kaa sanhaar karne ke kaaran vishesh mahatv ke hai
 The plenipenia subclass is divided into the following families: kisi bhugolic kshetra yaa jan samooh par satta yaa prabhutv ke sampoorn niyantran par anany adhikaar ko samprabhutaa kaha jaataa he
 The sovereign is the highest lawmaker and controller, that is, sovereignty is the supreme power of the state
 europe main aadhunik rajya ke udai ke parinamswaroop satrahavin sadi main 'samprabhutaa' kii avadharana kaa janm hua
 In European Europe, the power in European kingdoms and empires was divided between the king, the pope and the feudal lords
 pandrahavin or solahavin sadi main samantvaad ke tirohit hone or udhar protestant mat ke ubhaar ke kaaran catholic carch kii manyata main hraas hone se samprabhu rajyon ko panpane kaa mauka mila
 Sovereignty means 'total and unlimited power'
 lekin iske nihitarth itane sahaj nahin hai
 Just by this meaning it is not known what is involved in the structure of this entire power
 Does it mean any supreme statutory authority or is it related to a political power that cannot be challenged? samprabhutaa ke arth sambandhi isi tarah ke vivaadon ke kaaran unnisvin sadi se hi ise do bhaagon main baant kar samajha jaataa rahaa he : vidhik samprabhutaa or raajnneetik samprabhutaa
 This concept is also practically accepted as internal sovereignty and external sovereignty
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik sanskaran kaa matlab he rajya ke bheetar hone vaale satta ke bantwaare main yani raajnneetik pranali ke bheetar sarvocch satta kaa mukaam
 External version refers to the ability of the state to remain active as an independent and autonomous entity under the international system
 samprabhutaa kii avadharana aadhunik raashtra or rashtrawaad ke aadhaar main bhi nihit he
 Without the mixed influence of ideas of national independence, self-rule and sovereignty, one cannot imagine the process of de-colonization under which new nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America grew up largely after World War II
 Was created vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke bich antar kaa ek bauddhik itihaas he jise samajhane ke liye jyaan bodaan or thomas hobbs ke tatsambandhit matbhedon par nazar daalani hogi
 Bodan, in his work The Six Books of Commonwealth, argues in favor of a sovereign who makes laws himself, but places himself above those laws
 is vichaar ke mutabik kanoon kaa arth he logon ko samprabhu ke aadesh par chalaanaa
 This does not mean that Boda wanted to advocate an autocratic ruler here
 unki manyata thi ki kanoon banane or unka anupaalan karaane vaala samprabhu shaasha ek ucchtar kanoon ke adheen rahegaa
 That is, the seal of divine law will be necessary on the authority of the temporal ruler
 bodaan ke is vichaar ke vipareet hobbs apni rachana levaythan main samprabhutaa ke vichaar kii vyakhya praadhikaar ke sandarbh main na karke satta ke sandarbh main karte hai
 Prior to Hobbes, St
 Augustine stressed the need for a sovereign who would control the moral evils inherent in humanity
 isi tark kaa or vikaas karte hue hobbs ne samprabhutaa ko damankaaree satta par ekadhikaar ke rup main paribhaashit karte hue sifaarish kii ki yah takat akele shaasha ke haath main honi chahie
 Although Hobbes preferred uninterrupted monarchy, he was also willing to believe that it could be in the hands of a small faction of rulers or a democratic assembly
 bodaan or hobbs ke bich kii yah bahes bataati he ki vidhik samprabhutaa rajya ke kanoon ko sarvopari maanane par tiki hui he
 In contrast, political sovereignty is linked to the actual distribution of power
 is fark ke baavjood yah bhi maananaa padegaa ki samprabhutaa kii vyaavhaarik dharna main vidhik pahalu bhi hote hai or raajnneetik bhi
 The sovereignty of modern states is also dependent on the supremacy of the law and on the power system that complies with the law, which has a repressive machinery
 koi bhi kanoon mahaz naitik baadhyataaon ke dam par lagu nahin hota
 It cannot be sustained without a system of punishment, police, jails and courts
 vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa kaa yah sameekaran donon taraf se kargar hota dikhaai detaa he
 If the law requires a system of power for its compliance, then the power requires the recommendation of the law for its legitimacy
 shashan ko kanoonsammat or samvidhansammat hona padataa he, tabhi uski vaidhata kaayam rah paati he
 Only dictatorial governments work on the basis of political sovereignty
 agar sarkaar loktantric he to uski damankaaree mashinari ko kanoon kii simaaon main rah kar adaalaton ke sammukh javabdeh rahanaa padataa he
 The question of the internal nature of sovereignty has been much debated in the realm of political theory
 akhir sarvocch or aseemit satta kaa mukaam kya hona chahie? kya use kisi ek shaasha ke haath main rakhaa janaa shreyaskar hoga yaa uskaa centre kisi pratinidhitvamoolak sanstha main nihit hona behatar hoga? satrahavin sadi main frans ke samraat lui chaudaaven ne darp se kaha tha ki main hi rajya hoon
 The rationale behind giving sovereignty in the hands of a person is that in that case sovereignty will be guaranteed to be inseparable
 uski abhivyakti ek hi awaz main hogi or usamen koi doosraa praadhikaar hastkshep nahin kar paayegaa
 Effective interference in this totalitarian notion of sovereignty was done in the eighteenth century when jean-jacques Rousseau introduced the concept of popular sovereignty
 ruso ne rajshahi kii hukumat ko kaarij karte hue apni rachana soshal kantrect main likhaa : ‘manushya swatantra paidaa hota he, par har jagah vah zanjiron main jakadaaa hua he
 In fact, the social contract gives a new form to modern political philosophy
 unka saamaajik samjhauta hobbs or lock ke saamaajik samjhaute se alag he
 Philosophers prior to Rousseau believed that humans are different from other beings because of their intellectual abilities, while Rousseau believes that humans are different because of their ability to make moral choices
 agar use yah chunaav karne kii azaadi na di jaae to vah das se adhik kuch nahin rah jayega
 Since society is full of various freedoms, and man cannot return to the early world of his natural freedom, Rousseau suggests that he should exchange that freedom with civil liberties
 iske liye manushya ko ek-duusare se mil kar sanghathan bananaa hoga, saamaajik astitv rachana hoga jiske tahat sabhi log apane adhikaar tyaag denge or badale main naagarik ke rup main adhikaar praapt karenge, ek samprabhu ke sadsy ke rup main rahenge
 That is, a constitution will have to be made, under which every person will be subject and also a participating citizen
 keval isi tarah swatantraaa kii guarantee kii ja sakegi
 This was the concept of democracy, but the Russo did not agree with democracy or law-making run by the representatives of the people
 pracheen yunaan ke pratyaksh loktantr kii tarah ruso chaahate the ki sabhi naagarik ek saarvajanik sthaan par jamaa ho kar vidhi nirmaan karen
 To save the minority from being subject to the decision taken by the majority, Rousseau favored a consensus which formulated his most well-known principle 'public will' to make it effective
 ‘jan-ichha’ ke aadhaar par rache gayi kanoon ke paalan kaa matlab tha swayan apni ichha kaa paalan karnaa
 The principle of 'public will' introduced by Russo later became the basis of modern democratic theory
 ruso ne aise nagarikon ke sahaj samudaay kalpana kii thi jo oonch- neech ke sambandhon se pare samanta or ekta ke vaahak honge, isliye unhen vishwaas tha ki unke bich main ‘jan-ichha’ uplabdh karnaa aasaan hoga
 But Rousseau could never answer the question of how the 'journal-will' would come out of the wishes expressed in the general assembly of citizens
 isliye ant main ve yah kehete hue nazar aaye ki agar ‘jan- ichha’ nahin uplabdh ho paa rahi he to bahumat kii ichha ko hi uskaa paryaay maan liya janaa chahie
 The principle of sovereignty has also been taken up by the advocates of liberal-democratic thought
 unka kahana he ki bahultavaadi or loktantric shashan ke sandarbh main samprabhutaa kii dharna anaavashyak he
 These people consider the idea of sovereignty as suffering from its totalitarian past and therefore undesirable
 unka kahana he ki loktantric sarkarein damankaaree mashinari dwaara thope jane vaale kathith rup se vidhisammat shashan dwaara nahin chalatin
 They rule through an equation of control and balance and a network based on it
 darasal, sanghatmak charitra vaale aadhunik rajyon main aantarik samprabhutaa kaa centre tay karnaa bahut mushkil he
 In federal states such as the United States, Canada, Australia and India, the government is divided into two levels and each level has its own autonomous powers
 is prakaar ke rajyon main samprabhutaa centre or paridhi ke bich saajhedaari ke rup main ubhartee he
 In such a situation, if there is an undivided sovereign then it is the constitution which makes the center also sovereign and the states as well
 bahya samprabhutaa antarrashtriya vyavastha main kisi rajya kii haisiyat kii dyotak he
 There are also situations that the internal sovereignty of a state continues to be disputed, but its external sovereignty is respected in the international arena
 vaise bhi loktantron ke yug main aantarik samprabhutaa ke masale ab itane zyaada ahm nahin maane jate, par bahya samprabhutaa kaa prashn pehle se kahin zyaada mahatvapurn ho chukaa he
 There are many international disputes in which the claim of sovereignty of one country is seen as a challenge to its sovereignty from another country
 philistiniyon dwaara apane samprabhu raashtra ke liye chalaaya jane vaala andolan isroyal ko apni samprabhutaa ke kshay kaa kaarak lagata he

When intelligence was fully confirmed that Ram Prasad 'bismil', who was the leader of Hindustan democracy union, was not in the city that day, on the night of 26 September 1925, Bismil was arrested along with 40 people from all over India

 The desire for goodness is now in our heart, to see how much emphasis is on the side! Let the time come and tell you, o hope, what can we tell from now on, what is in our heart!

Now in Dile-'bismil! paanch faraar krantikariyon main ashfak ulla khan ko dilli or shacheendra nath bakshi ko bhagalpur se police ne us samay giraftaar kiya jab kakori-kand ke mukhya mukademe kaa faisla sunaaya ja chukaa tha
 a supplementary case of the Kakori conspiracy was filed in the court of Special Judge JRW Bainet and on 13 July 1927, both of them hanged Ashfaq Ulla Khan and accused Shachindranath Bakshi of life imprisonment, accusing them of conspiring against the government
 She went

 Both cases appeared before the Chief Justice of the Chief Court, Sir Louis Schutt and Special Judge Mohammad Raza

 Ram Prasad 'bismil' made his own plea as he was given a simple simple lawyer named Laxmishankar Mishra at government expense, which he refused to take
 bismil ne chif court ke saamne jab dharapravaah angreji main faisle ke khilaaf bahes kii to sarkari vakil jagatnarayan mullah ji baglein jhaankate najar aaye
 At this, Chief Justice Louis Shirts had to ask Bismil in English - "mr
 Ramprasad! From bhich university you have taken the degree of la?" At this, Bismil had laughed and replied to the Chief Justice - "excuse me sir! a king maker did require an Anne degree
" " The trial of Kakori case was going on in Lucknow
 pandit jagatnarayan mullah sarkari vakil ke saath urdu ke shaayar bhi the
 He used the word "mulajim" instead of "muljiman" for the accused
 phir kya tha pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne tapaak se un par ye chutili fabti kasi: "mulajim hamako mat kahiye, bada afsos hota he; adaalat ke adab se ham yahan tasharif laae hai
 We turn around with our juridis; That we have also lit lamps in the intestines often
 " unke kehane kaa matlab spashth tha ki mulajim ve nahin, mullah ji hai jo sarkaar se tankhwaah pate hai
 He is a political prisoner, so deal with him
 saath hi yah taakid bhi kii ki ve samudr tak kii lehren apane dussahas se palatney kaa dam rakhte hai; mukademe kii baaji palatnaa koun cheez? itnaa bolne ke baad kiski himmat thi jo unke aage thahartaa
 Mulla ji was left with sweat and he thought good in cutting the trowel
 ve chupchaap pichley daravaaje se khisak liye
 Then he did not cross-examine any other day
 aise hazirajabaab the bismil! The debate on cleanliness by Bismil caused sensation in the government section
 mullah ji ne sarkari vakil kii haisiyat se pairvi karne main anakani kii
 Therefore, the court rejected Bismil's plea for self-advocacy on 18 July 1927
 uske baad unhone 76 prishth kii tarkpurna likhit bahes pesh kii jise dekhakar jajon ne yah shankaa vyakt kii ki yah bahes bismil ne swayan na likhakar kisi vidhivetta se likhvai he
 Ultimately, the same Lakshmishankar Mishra was allowed to argue, which Bismil refused to take
 yah bhi adaalat or sarkari vakil jagatnarayan mullah kii mili bhagat se kiya gaya
 Because if Bismil were allowed to contest the entire case himself, the government would surely lose the case
 22 agast 1927 ko jo faisla sunaaya gaya uske anusaar ram prasad bismil, rajendranath lahidi va ashfak ulla khan ko ai0pi0si0 kii dfa 121 va 120 ke antargat aaajeevan karawas tathaa 302 va 396 ke anusaar phaansi evam thakur roshan singh ko pehali do dfaaon main 5+5 kul 10 varsh kii kadi kaid tathaa agali do dfaaon ke anusaar phaansi kaa hukum hua
 Shachindranath Sanyal, expressing his remorse in writing when he was in jail, had pledged not to take part in any future revolutionary action, on the basis of which his life-imprisonment was going on

 Despite appeals to the Chief Court, the decorations of Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Mukundi Lal and Govindcharan Kar were increased from 10 to 10 years in life imprisonment
 sureshchandra bhattacharya va vishnusharan dublish kii sajaayen bhi 7 varsh se badhaakar 10 varsh kar di gayi
 Ramakrishna Khatri also remained sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment

 Another accused Ram Dulare Trivedi was sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment in this case

 By the first half of the seventeenth century the messenger system had become prevalent in most countries of Europe

 sandhivaarta aadi ke liye niyukt doot ko ek 'purnadhikaarptr' bhi diya jaataa he
 No nation is obliged to accept hostile relations with another nation, but not accepting the messenger who came for talks on a particular question is a sign of the determination to not negotiate on that question
 vyaktivishesh ko anya raashtra ke doot rup main grahan na karnaa usee dasha main uchit hoga jab apane charitra, pratyaatit raashtra ke prati vyakt vichaar athwa pratyaatit raashtra kaa naagarik hone ke kaaran vah vyakti grahya na ho

 In the early period of Greek diplomacy, ambassadors were selected on the basis of their voice, sweet speech, valid intelligence and attractive personality
 bigentini yug ke rajanyik se yah apeksha kii jaati thi ki ve videshiyon ke prati shisht ho tathaa uski aalochanananhin kare
 According to Nicholson the following nine qualifications were expected from the ideal diplomat in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, based on the experience of the diplomatic system: - yadhyapi ek rajanyik abhimartta kii yogyatayen rajya ke kanoonon dwaara nishchit kii jaati he, parantu rajanyik abhikarta kii yogyata ke sambandh main aise siddhanton kaa nirupan kar diya he jo sabhi deshon main rajanyikon se apekshit he
 There are constant changes in the rules regarding the nature of diplomacy and the qualifications of diplomats, but in the present age it is only appropriate to know the qualities of a successful and ideal ambassador, that the qualities of ideal ambassadors mentioned by ancient and medieval writers and the ambassadors themselves
