 uranium khanan jameen se uranium ayask kii nikasi kii prakriya he
 In 2015, worldwide uranium production was 60,496 tonnes
 puure duniya main 70 fisadi utpaadan maatr teen deshon kazakhstan, canada or australia main hota he
 Apart from these three countries, countries producing one thousand tons are Niger, Russia, Namibia, Uzbekistan, China, United Nations and Ukraine
 khanan se praapt uranium kaa lagbhag puri tarah se parmaanu sanyantron main eendhan ke rup main prayog hota he
 The ore material is milled to obtain uranium ore, from which all particles are of the same size and then uranium is extracted by chemical reaction
 is prakriya dwaara ek pile rang kaa shushk churna praapt hota he
 It is sold in the uranium market as U3O8
 uranium kaa khoj varsh 1789 main kiya gaya tha, lekin khanan karne waalon ne uranium ayask ko pehle hi dekh liya tha
 In the year 1565, Krausne Hori reported that uranium oxide, which is found in such substances as resin, was found
 iske baad or iske khoj se purv jaichimov main 1727 or schvarwald main 1763 main iske ayask milane kaa pataa chalaa tha
 In the nineteenth century uranium ore was obtained from mining in Bohemia and Cornwall
 pehali baar jaanakar iske khanan kaa kaary jaichimov main hua tha
 It is also called the city of silver mining
 mairi curi ne bhi jaichimov se nikaale ayask se hi radium naamak tatv ko alag kiya tha
 Until the Second World War, it was mainly used to obtain radium
 iskaa upyog swasthya se jude kaaryon, ghadi or anya chizon main chamkile rang ke rup main kiya jaataa tha, par iskaa upyog kuch anya sthanon main bhi kiya gaya tha, jo hanikaarak tha
 The use of this uranium was mainly used in yellow

 Socialism is an economic-social philosophy
 samaajawaadee vyavastha main dhan-sampatti kaa swaamitv or vitaran samaaj ke niyantran ke adheen rahete hai
 Socialism opposes rights based on private property as economic, social and ideological suffixes
 uski ek buniyadi pratigya yah bhi he ki smapda kaa utpaadan or vitaran samaaj yaa rajya ke haathon main hona chahie
 In the modern sense of politics, socialism is seen as contrary to the principle of capitalism or free market
 ek raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke rup main samaajwaad europe main atharahavin or unnisvin sadi main ubhare udyogikaran kii anyonyakriya main viksit hua he
 British political scientist Harold Loskey once called socialism a cap that anyone wears
 samaajwaad kii vibhinn kismein loski ke is chithran ko kaaphi seemaa tak roopayit karti he
 a variety of socialism is a reflection of the totalitarian control of the disintegrated Soviet Union, in which all possible aspects of human life were urged to bring the state under control
 uski duusari kism rajya ko arthvyavastha ke niyaman dwaara kalyankari bhoomika nibhaane kaa mantra detii he
 a different form of socialism has been tried in India
 raamamanohar lohia, jai prakaash narayan or narendra dev ke raajnneetik chintan or vyavhaar se nikalne vaale pratyay ko 'gandhivaadi samaajwaad' kii sangya di jaati he
 Socialism is the Hindi version of the English and French words 'socialism'
 19veen shatabdi ke purvardh main is shabd kaa prayog vyaktvaad ke virodh main or un vichaaron ke samarthan main kiya jaataa tha jinka lakshya samaaj ke aarthik or naitik aadhaar ko badalanaa tha or jo jivan main vyaktigat niyantran kii jagah saamaajik niyantran sthapit karnaa chaahate the
 The term socialism is used in many and sometimes conflicting contexts; Such as groupism anarchism, primitive tribal communism, military communism, Christian socialism, cooperativeism, etc
 - even the Natsi party had the full name 'national Socialist Party'
 samaajwaad kii paribhaasha karnaa kathin he
 It is both a principle and a movement and it takes different forms in different historical and local circumstances
 mulat: yah vah andolan he jo utpaadan ke mukhya sadhano ke samajikaran par aadhaarit vargvihin samaaj sthapit karne ke liye prayatnsheel he or jo majdoor varg ko iskaa mukhya aadhaar banaata he, kyonki vah is varg ko shoshit varg maanata he jiskaa aitihaasik kaary vargavyavastha kaa ant karnaa he
 In a primitive communist society, humans used to get the necessary things by mutual cooperation and divide them among the needs of each member
 parantu yah samyawad prakritik tha; manushya kii sachet kalpana par aadhaarit nahin tha
 The way of living of the early Christian clergy was very communist, they lived together and equally, but the source of their income was the donation of the religious and their ideal was not limited to the masses but only to the clergy
 unka uddeshy bhi aadhyatmik tha, bhautik nahin
 The same is true of medieval Christian communism
 piru desh kii pracheen inkaa sabhyataa ko 'sainya samyawad' kii sangya di jaati he, parantu uskaa aadhaar sainya sanghathan tha or vah vyavastha shaasha varg kaa hitsaadhan karti thi
 The attainment of the means of public service by the municipalities, or the mere use of economic schemes for the advancement of the country, cannot be called socialism, because capitalism is not necessarily hurt by them
 natsi dal ne bainkon kaa rashtrikaran kiya tha parantu poonjeewaadi vyavastha akshunn rahi
 Radical movements such as the levellers and diggers developed during the seventeenth century in England and radical movements such as the Anabaptists developed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in the Middle East in England have been instrumental in building the emotional structure of socialism
 lekin samaajwaad kii aadhunik or aupchaarik pariklpana francisi vichaarkon sain-simon or charles furiye tathaa british chintak rabart oven kii nishpattiyon se nikalati he
 These early thinkers of socialism imagined a society based on mutual cooperation rather than individualism and competition
 unhen vishwaas tha ki maanviya swabhaav or samaaj kaa vigyaan garh kar saamaajik taane-bane ko behatar rup diya ja saktaa he
 But there were many differences between them regarding concrete details of desired social forms, strategy to achieve them and understanding of human nature
 udhaaharan ke liye, sain-simon tathaa furiye ruso ke is mat se sahamat nahin the ki manushya kii prakruti apni banaavat main to acchhee, udaatt or vivekpurna he lekin aadhunik samaaj or nijee sampatti ne use bhrasht kar diya he
 His argument against this was that there are certain fixed and definite forms of human nature that can be reconciled on the basis of mutual cooperation
 oven kaa mat sain-simon or furiye se bhi alag tha
 He said that human nature is determined by external conditions and can be given the desired form
 isliye samaaj kii paristhitiyon ko is tarah badla janaa chahie ki manushya kii prakruti purnataa kii ore bad sake
 According to him, if mutual cooperation and unity will be promoted in place of competition and individualism, then the whole of humanity can be benefited
 samaajwaad kii raajnneetik vichaardhaara unnisvin sadi ke tisare or chauthe dashakon ke dauraan england, frans tathaa germany jaise europee deshon main lokapriy hone lagi thi
 The rapid pace of industrialization and urbanization and the decline of traditional society had made European society an arena of reform and change forces, with groups ranging from trade unions and charterist groups active to advocating pre-modern communalism in place of modern society Were
 marks or angels dwaara pratipaadit vaigyanik samaajwaad kaa vichaar saamaajik or raajnneetik uthalputhal kii isi prishthbhumi main viksit hua tha
 Marx drew inspiration from the ideas of saan-simo, Furie, and Owen, but declared his socialism to be 'imaginary' in comparison to his 'scientific' socialism
 in purvavarti chintakon kii tarah marks samaajwaad ko koi aisa adarsh nahin maanate ki uskaa spasht kaakaa khinchaa jaae
 Marx and Engels see socialism as a situation arising out of the functioning of capitalism rather than any self-land theory
 unka maananaa tha ki samaajwaad kaa koi bhi rup aitihaasik prakriya se hi ubharegaa
 Due to this understanding, Marx and Engels were also reluctant to elaborate or define socialism
 unke liye samaajwaad mukhyatah poonjeewaad ke nakaar main khadaa pratyay tha jise ek lambi krantikari prakriya ke zariye apni pahchaan khud gadhani thi
 Marx's most important work on socialism is 'critique of the Gotha Program' in which he has interpreted socialism as the intermediate stage of the two phases of communist society
 gauratlab he ki marks kii is rachana kaa prakaashan unki mrityu ke aath saal baad hua tha
 Till then it was not given much importance in Marxist theories
 is vimarsh ko marxvad ke mul siddhanton main shaamil karne kaa shrey lenin ko jaataa he, jinhone apni kriti 'state and revolution' main marks ke hawaale se samaajwaad ko samyavaadee samaaj kii rachana main pehla yaa nimnatar charan bataaya
 After Lenin, socialism was configured in Marxist terminology in such a way that any person or party could call themselves socialist or communist without any particular ideological problem
 is vimarsh kii vibhaajak rekha is baat se tay hoti thi ki kisi dal yaa vyakti ke liye krantikari gatividhiyon kaa taatkaalik or doorgaami lakshya kya he
 That is, if someone called himself a socialist, then it meant that he emphasizes the first phase of the creation of a communist society
 yahi vajah he ki kai samaajawaadee deshon main shashan karne vaale dal jab khud ko communist ghoshit karte the to ise asangat nahin mana jaataa tha
 The international spread of socialism in the twentieth century and the Soviet system of governance are considered to be concurrent phenomena
 yah ek aisa tathy he jisane samaajwaad ke vichaar or uske bhavishya ko gaharaai se prabhavit kiya he
 For example, after the revolution, the Soviet Union became synonymous with socialism for both its supporters and critics
 soviet samarthakon kii daleel yah thi ki utpaadan ke pramukh sadhano ke samajikaran, bazaar ko kendrikrut niyojan ke maatahat karne, tathaa videsh vyapaar va gharelu vitt par rajya ke niyantran jaise upaay apnaane se soviet sangh bahut kam avadhi main ek audyogic desh ban gaya
 While its critics said that it was a publicized image because the vast bureaucracy, political repression, inequality and neglect of democracy were enough to reject the ideal of socialism itself
 samaajwaad ke prasar main soviet sangh kii duusari bhoomika ek sanghathankarta kii thi
 By establishing an organization like Communist International for the spread of socialist revolution, he proved himself to be a vanguard of socialism
 is sanghathan ne vishwa kii communist partiyon kaa lambe samay tak disha-nirdesan kiya
 The third aspect of the role of the Soviet Union was that it established many similar administrative systems in Eastern Europe
 antat soviet sangh samaajwaad kii prayogshaala isliye bhi mana gaya kyonki roosi kranti ke baad stallin ke netritv main yah siddhant prachaarit kiya gaya ki samaajawaadee kranti kaa anya deshon main prasar karne se pehle use ek hi desh main majboot kiya janaa chahie
 To many scholars, this was a formulation that legitimized the emergence of many varieties of National Socialism
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad shuru hui vi-upniveshikaran kii prakriya ke dauraan samaajwaad or rashtrawaad kaa yah sanshray teesri duniya ke deshon main samaajwaad ke vikaas kaa ek praaroop sa ban gaya
 This was a central tendency of the spread of socialism in countries such as China, Vietnam and Cuba
 soviet samarthit samaajwaad ke alaava uskaa ek anya rup bhi he jisane poonjeewaadi deshon ko apratyaksh dhang se prabhavit kiya he
 For example, to counterbalance the logic and attractiveness of socialism, the capitalist countries of the west had to change the mold of their economy and give it a welfare form
 is sandarbh main scandenevian deshon, pashchimi europe tathaa austrailesia kshetra ke deshon main kines ke lokopkaaree vichaaron se prerit hokar soviet tarz ke samaajwaad kaa vikalp gadhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 These welfare measures, based on demand management, economic nationalism, guarantee of employment, and the policy of keeping the social services sector free from profiteering tendencies, had once blurred the gap between capitalism and socialism
 rajya ke is kalyankari model ko ek samay poonjeewaad kii visangatiyon— bekaari, berojgaare, abhaav, agyaan aadi kaa sthai ilaaj bataaya ja rahaa tha
 The evidence of the economic and political success of this model can be considered that if these measures were praised in the left circles then even the right wing politics could not openly oppose them
 duusare vishwa-yuddh kii samaapti ke baad teen dashakon tak bazaar kendrit samaajwaad kaa yah model kaaphi prabhaavshaalee dhang se kaam karata rahaa
 But in the seventh decade, questions about the appropriateness of this model began to arise due to the double hit of recession and inflation and the increasing social and industrial dissatisfaction in the bastion of welfare capitalism
 marxvaadi shivi ke vidwaan bhi lagaataar yah kehete aa rahe the ki kalyankari bhangimaaon ne asamanta or shoshan ko khatm karne ke bajaay poonjeewaad ko hi majboot kiya he
 One objectionable aspect of this model was also the manifestation that the state was put in a position to control it by the machinery providing basic amenities of life to the working class
 bazaar ko kaayam rakhte hue samaajwaad ke kuch tattvon par amal karne vaale is model kaa nav-udaarataavaadi buddhijivi shuru se hi virodh karte aaye the
 In the seventh decade, this class began to loudly say that socialism not only makes the economy root but also takes away the freedom of the individual
 nawein dashak main jab soviet sangh ke saath purvi europe kii samaajawaadee vyavasthaayen ek ke baad ek dhahne lagi to samaajwaad kii is aalochana ko vyapak vaidhata milane lagi or samaajwaad ke saath itihaas ke ant kii bhi baaten kii jane lagi
 In the frenzy of victory, the liberal intellectuals also said that capitalism is the only option for humanity, so now forgetting about its alternative, it should be thought only that what can be another form of capitalism
 karl marks ke saathi angills ne apane purv prachlit aadhunik samaajwaad ke praarambhik dhaaraon ko kaalpanaalokeey samaajwaad kaa naam diya
 The basis of these ideas was moral, not physical and scientific; Their thinkers believed in reformist means of achieving the goal; And used to imagine a broad but unrealistic vision of future society
 inamen saan siimon, charles furiye, or robert oven aadi ke samaajawaadee vichaar sammilit kiya gaya he
 {main} Scientific Socialism}} britain main fabian sosayadi kii sthapana san 1883-84 i
 main hui
 Under the influence of Robert Owen and the Chartist movement, the foundation of the independent labor movement was laid here, the Fabian Society saw this movement
 is sabha kaa naam fabius kanctator fabian ke naam se liya gaya he
 Fabius was a fighter from ancient Rome who fought patiently in the struggle against Hannibal, the famous general of Carthage, and was defeated over the years by Guerilla policy
 isi prakaar fabian samaajwaadiyon kaa vichaar he ki poonjeewaad ko keval ek muthbhed main krantikari maarg dwaara parrast nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This requires considerable thought and preparation
 inkaa tarika vikaas or sudhaarwadi he
 Before the establishment of the independent working party, they wanted to enter the various political parties of Britain and fulfill their purpose
 inkaa mukhya dhyey charam naitik sambhaavnaaon ke anusaar samaaj kaa punarnirmaan tha
 They consider the state as a social instrument rather than a tool of class governance through which social welfare and socialism are possible
 in vichaarkon ne na keval sansad varan nagarpalika or gramin kshetreey parishadon dwaara bhi samaajawaadee prayogon kaa kaarykram apanaaya
 Therefore, their ideas are called democratic, parliamentary, ballot box, octroi, development or reformist socialism
 in vichaarkon main pramukh sidney web, jaaj barnad shaw, kol, eni besent, graham walas ityadi hai
 These thinkers are deeply influenced by the ideas of the British tradition, utilitarianism, Robert Owen, Christian Socialism and the Chartist movement and the economists of John Stuart Mill
 germany kaa punraritivaad britain ke fabiaswad tathaa germany kii parivartit paristhatiyon se prabhavit hua tha
 The form of Germany and the former European society was feudalistic and democratic of the state and autocratic, so until the late 19th century the socialist ideas here were fierce revolutionary and organization conspiratorial
 in deshon par marks ke vichaaron kaa prabhaav tha
 But at the end of the 19th century, there was also industrial progress in Germany and the state accepted certain personal and political rights
 falat: mazdooron kaa jeevanaster unchaa hua tathaa unke raajnneetik dal - saamaajik loktantrvaadi party kaa prabhaav, bhi badha
 Many of its members became Members of Parliament
 is sthiti main yah bal siddhantat: marks ke krantikari maarg ko sweekaar karte hue bhi vyavhaar main sudhaarwadi ho gaya
 Eduard Bernstein attempted to revise Marxism on the basis of this reality
 bernstin saamaajik lotantravaadi party kaa pramukh darshanik or angills kaa nikat shishy tha
 He was exiled in Britain for many years and was influenced by Fabiusism
 marks kaa kathan tha ki paraspar pratiyogita or aarthik sankaton ke kaaran poonjeewaadi tathaa madhyavarg sankuchit hota jayega or majdoor varg nirdhan, vistrut, sangathit tathaa krantikari banataa jayega jisase sheeghra hi samaajwaad kii sthapana sambhav ho sakegi
 The situation was the opposite, which Bernstein accepted, and on this basis, he insisted on class-cooperation in the place of class struggle and on the communal and constitutional path for the success of social reform and socialism in the place of revolutionary program
 vah marks ke aitihaasik bhautikwaad ke sthaan par naitik tathaa anaarthik tatwon ke prabhaav ko bhi sweekaar karne laga
 Bernstein's ideas were given to repetitionism
 yadhyapi german majdoor andolan vyavhaar main sudhaarwadi rahaa tathaapi karl kautski ke netritv main usne bernstin ke sanshodhano kaa asweekaar karke marks ke vichaaron main vishwaas prakat kiya
 Fabius and recapitalist thinkers consider the state necessary for the establishment of socialism
 samyavaadee vichaarak bhi sankraman kaal ke liye adam kii shakti kaa prayog karnaa chaahate hai
 Hence, they are called collectivists
 araajaktaavaadi vichaarak bhi poonjeewaad virdohi or samaajwaad ke samarthak hai parantu ve rajya, raajnneeti or dharm ko shoshanvyavastha kaa samarthak maanate hai or aarambh se hi inkaa ant kar dena chaahate hai
 Anarchism is a theory of life and conduct that envisions a society without rule
 yah samaaj ke aikya kii sthapana shashan or kanoon dwaara nahin, varan vyakti tathaa sthaneey or vyavsaayik samoohon ke swatantra samjhauton dwaara karnaa chahta he
 According to this idea, many human needs of production, distribution etc
 can be fulfilled by the above mentioned groups
 araajaktaa shabd ke francisi roopaantar kaa prayog pehali baar francisi kranti ke samay un krantikariyon ke liye kiya gaya tha jo saamanton kii jameen ko jabt karke kisaanon main baantna or dhanikon kii aay ko simit karnaa chaahate the
 Then in 1840, the French thinker Prudhों used the term in his book "what is property?"
 san 1871 ke baad jab antarrashtriya majdoor sangh main foot padi tab marks ke sanghavaadi virodhiyon ko araajaktaavaadi kaha gaya
 Terrorism and anarchism are synonyms in the language of the day; But in fact, philosophical anarchists are only in favor of terror and revolutionary measures against state repression
 sansar kaa pratham araajaktaavaadi vichaarak chini darshanik lao tse mana jaataa he
 These ideas are also embedded in the philosophy of ancient Greek thinkers Aristippus and Gino
 britain kaa godwin or francisi prudhon rajya or shashansansthaaon-nyaayalay aadi kaa virodh karte the
 According to Prudh, property is stolen goods
 vah shram ke aadhaar par panya vinimay or lenden main ek pratishat byaaj kii dar ke paksh main tha
 The views of Russia's three anarchists are important in this regard
 bakunin krantikari araajaktaavaadi tha, pinras cropotkin vaigyanik araajaktaavaadi tathaa leo talsty isai araajaktaavaadi
 The Bakoonin considered the state to be an essential deterrent and a sign of backwardness and a nutrient for property and exploitation
 rajya vyakti kii swadhinata, uski pratibha or krayshakti, uske vivek or naitikta ko simit karata he
 Thus anarchism is the climax of individualism
 bakunin krantikari maarg dwaara rajya or uski sansthaaon police, jail, nyaayalay aadi kaa ant kar swatantra sthaneey sansthaaon kii sthapana ke paksh main tha
 These communities could establish their own national association for mutual cooperation
 ruso or kaant bhi isi prakaar ke swatantra samudaayon or sanghon ke samarthak the
 Kropotkin proved through scientific study that the development of society is towards independent cooperation
 shilpic unnati ke kaaran manushya bahut kam shram dwaara apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti kar sakegaa or shesh samay swatantra jivan vyateet karegaa
 Man is by nature social, therefore a cooperative animal
 swatantraaa or sahyog kii vruddhi ke saath saath rajya kii aavashyaktaa kam ho jaaegi
 Talstoy was also opposed to state and personal property, but was not a nurturer of a violent and revolutionary path, but an advocate of Christian and non-violent methods
 vah buddhisangat isai tha, andhvishwasi nahin
 Talstoy has a deep impression on Gandhiji's thoughts
 araajaktaavaadiyon kaa vichaar he ki manushya swabhaav se acha he or yadi uske upar rajya kaa niyantran na rahe to vah samaaj main shantipurvak rah saktaa he
 The intellectual, moral and emotional development of man is not possible while in the state
 inke anusaar rajkeey samaajwaad naukarshahivaad or rajkeey poonjeewaad he
 They are opposed to war and militarism and in favor of decentralization
 araajaktaavaad se buddhijivi or majdoor, donon hi prabhavit hue hai
 Many writers and philosophers have accepted the idea of independence
 inamen jon stuart mil, harbart spencer, herold laski or batrend rasal ke naam mukhya hai
 Intellectual supporters of this ideology were found in many countries such as France, Spain, Italy, Russia, Germany, USA etc
, but the labor movements of France and Britain also accepted these ideas in revised form
 iske francisi swaroop kaa naam sindikawaad or british kaa gild samaajwaad he
 Syndicism and Guild Socialism originated in the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth
 us samay tak fabius or punraritivaad main mazdooron kaa vishwaas kam hone laga tha
 Democracy failed to solve the problems of the workers, the economic crisis began to take a heavy turn and the chances of war started increasing
 saath hi mazdooron kii sankhya main vruddhi hui, unka sanghathan majboot hua or ve apni maangon ko puraa karaane ke liye bade paimaane par hadtaal karne lage
 Under these circumstances, the working class needed principles of active opposition in place of communal and constitutional methods
 is kami ko uparyukt vichaardhaaraon ne puraa kiya
 Syndicism, like other socialists, is in favor of the socialist system but like anarchists wants social control in the hands of local communities by ending the state
 vah is niyantran ko keval utpaadak varg tak hi simit rakhana chahta he
 Like anarchists, syndicists are also supporters of national and international unions and opposed to the state, political parties, war and militarism
 dhyey kii prapti kaa sindicavaadi maarg kranti he, parantu is kranti ke liye bhi vah raajnneetik dal ko anaavashyak samajhataa he kyonki iske dwaara mazdooron kii krantikari ichha ke kamjor ho jane kaa bhay he
 It has unwavering faith in strikes
 soril ke anusaar isai puranic punarutthan kii bhanti yah bhi mazdooron par jaadu kaa asar karti he or unke andar aikya or kranti kii bhaawanaaon ko protsaahan detii he
 These thinkers are also in favor of sabotage, bycatch of machines, stigmatizing capitalist production, postponement etc
 ant main ek aam hadtaal dwaara poonjeewaadi vyavastha kaa ant kar ye sindikawaadi samaaj ko sthapana karnaa chaahate hai
 France, Italy, Spain, Central and South America have been affected by these ideas
 inkaa asar sanyukt rajya america main bhi tha, parantu vahaan vikendrikaran par jor nahin diya gaya kyonki us desh main bade paimaane ke udyog ek vaastaviktaa the
 The Russian thinker Prince Kropotkin drew inspiration from this and was accepted by Britain in a revised form
 gild samaajwaad sindikawaad kii pratilipi maatr nahin, uskaa british paristhitiyon main abhyanukulan he
 Guild Socialism is also influenced by the tradition of independence and Fabianism
 iskaa naam europe ke madhyakaalin vyavsaayik sanghathanon se liya gaya he
 From that time the unions dominated the economic and social life and the representatives of the various unions ruled the cities
 gild samaajawaadee uparyukt sangh vyavastha se prerana grahan karte the
 They wanted to establish democratic principles and autonomy in the political arena and industry
 ye vichaarak udyogon ke rashtriyakaran maatr se santusht nahin kyonki isse naukarshahi kaa bhay he parantu ve rajya kaa ant bhi nahin karnaa chaahate
 After making the state more democratic and decentralized, they want to keep it for the defense of the country and for the benefit of the consumer
 unke anusaar rajkeey sansad main keval kshetreey hi nahin, vyavsaayik pratinidhitiv bhi hona chahie
 They want laborers control over the state and industries, so they are close to syndicism but due to not being anti-state, they also have inclination towards groupism
 ye asafalataa ke bhay se krantikari maarg ko sweekaar nahin karte lekin keval vaidhanik maarg ko bhi aparyaapt samajhate hai or mazdooron ke sakriy andolan, hadtaal aadi kaa bhi samarthan karte hai
 The influence of this ideology increased between and before the First World War
 yuddh ke samay mazdooron ne raksha-udyogon par niyantran kii maang kii or uske baad majdoor sanghon ne swayan makaan banane ke theke liye, parantu kuch kaal baad sarkari sahaayta na milane par ye prayog asafal hue
 Notable supporters of Guild Socialism are Arthur Penty, Hobson, Orange and Cole

 The question before the labor movements was whether they should adopt revolutionary path or take reformist path for the establishment of socialism
 in paristhitiyon main katipay sudhaarwadi vichaardhaaraon kaa janm hua
 Among these, Christian Socialism, Fabiusism and Reorientation are the main ones
 isai samaajwaad ke mukhya prachaarak britain ke jaan melcome ludlo, france ke bishap clad foshe or germany ke victor ime hubar hai
 Seeing the plight of the workers through capitalist exploitation, these thinkers criticized this system and propagated the cooperative movement among the workers
 unhone utpaadak tathaa bhokta sahakaari samitiyon kii sthapana bhi kii
 Christian socialism had its influence in Austria and Belgium in addition to Britain, France and Germany

 The word sandhi means 'mail'
 do nikatavarti varnon ke paraspar mail se jo vikaar hota he vah sandhi kehalaata he
 Like - Sama + Tosh = contentment; Dev + Indra = Devendra; Bhanu + Uday = Bhanuday
 sandhi teen prakaar kii hoti hai - The conjugation of two vowels is called vowel-joint
 jaise - vidya + aalay = vidhyalay
 There are five types of phonetics - sutara-ak: savarne deergh:arthath ak pratyaahaar ke baad uskaa savarna aaye to dono milakar deergh ban jate hai
 After Harsva or long A, E, U, if Harsva or long A, E, u come, then both become long A, e and O
 jaise - a / a + a / a = a i or i kii sandhi Treaty of u and OO isamen a, aa ke aage i, i ho to e ; u, uu ho to o tathaa ri ho to ar ho jaataa he
 This is called guna-sandhi
 jaise - a + e = A; Male + Indra = Narendra a + u = o ; gyaan + upadesh = gyanopadesh ; a + r = Ar Dev + Rishi = Devarshi aa + ri = ar maha + rishi = maharishi a becomes Aa when it matches A, a and a becomes a and o is o when they match O
 ise vruddhi sandhi kehete hai
 like - a + e = i ; ek + ek = ekaik ; a + o = Au One + Medicine = Vanaushadhi; Aa + o = Au Maha + Medicine = Mahoushadhi; i, i ke aage koi vijaateey swar hone par i i ko ‘y’ ho jaataa he
 U, UO becomes 'V' when a foreigner voice comes in front of U
 ‘ri’ ke aage kisi vijaateey swar ke aane par ri ko ‘r’ ho jaataa he
 These are called yana-sandhi
 i + a = y + a ; nadi + arpan = nadyarpan u + a = v + A; Experience e, i or o ou se pare kisi bhi swar ke hone par kramshah ay, aay, av or aav ho jaataa he
 This is called Ayadi Sandhi
 e + a = ay + a ; ne + an = nayan a + a = i + A; Gai + Ak = Singer o + a = av + a ; po + an = pawan Au + a = Av + A; Pau + aq = pavak ou + i = aav + i ; nau + ek = navik The change that occurs when the consonant matches the consonant or with a vowel is called consonant joint
 jaise-sharat + chandra = sharachchandra
 Brighter kisi varg ke pehle varna k, ch, t, t, p kaa mail kisi varg ke tisare athwa chauthe varna yaa y, r, l, v, ha yaa kisi swar se ho jaae to k ko g ch ko j, t ko d or p ko b ho jaataa he
 like - yadi kisi varg ke pehle varna kaa mail n yaa m varna se ho to uske sthaan par usee varg kaa paanchavaan varna ho jaataa he
 like - t kaa mail ga, gha, da, dha, ba, bha, ya, r, va yaa kisi swar se ho jaae to d ho jaataa he
 like - t se pare ch yaa chh hone par c, j yaa jh hone par j, t yaa th hone par t, d yaa dh hone par d or l hone par l ho jaataa he
 like - t kaa mail yadi sh se ho to t ko ch or sh kaa chh ban jaataa he
 like - t kaa mail yadi h se ho to t kaa d or h kaa dh ho jaataa he
 like - swar ke baad yadi chh varna aa jaae to chh se pehle ch varna badha diya jaataa he
 like - yadi m ke baad k se m tak koi vyanjan ho to m anuswaar main badal jaataa he
 like - m ke baad m kaa dvitv ho jaataa he
 like - m ke baad y, r, l, v, sh, sh, s, h main se koi vyanjan hone par m kaa anuswaar ho jaataa he
 like - ri, r, sh se pare n kaa n ho jaataa he
 But there is no question if class, class, category, power and s are interrupted
 jaise - If a vowel is different from a before A, the sound becomes silent
 jaise - The disorder that occurs in Visarga when the vowel or consonant comes after Visarga is called visarga-sandhi
 jaise- manah + anukool = manonukool If 'A' before 'visarga' and 'A' or 'third', fourth and fifth letters of classes, or Y, Su, L, and v before Visarga, it becomes o of Visarga
 jaise - Before Visarga, if there is a vowel except A, a and after it there is a vowel, third, fourth, fifth letter of the class or if any of Y, R, L, V, h becomes the word of Visarga
 jaise - If there is a vowel before the immersion and later if there is f, g or sh, then the sound of the immersion becomes
 jaise - After immersion, if there is root or c, then immersion becomes
 jaise - If there is any letter from A, B, T, TH, P, f before I, u and after Visarga, it becomes a word of Visarga
 jaise - If A, a comes before Visarga and after it is a different vowel, then Visarga is omitted
 jaise - There is no change in Visarga after A, b or P, f after immersion
 jaise - Lucknow Airport is located in Lucknow

 edward giban england ke itihaaskaar tathaa parlment sadsy the
 His work 'history of the Decline and Fall of Roman Empire' was published in six volumes between 1776 and 1788
 edward giban kaa janm putane nagar ke ek puraane shikshit gharaane main hua
 The father was a member of the parliament

 These were admitted in the Magdalen College of Oxford University, meaning of higher education, but they had to be removed from there only after fourteen months
 giban ne apni jeevani main likhaa he, ye chaudaa maas mere jivan kaa sabase anupayogi kaal siddh hua
 The independent life of the university was detrimental to Kishore Gibbon
 apane paitruk dharm protestant dharm se inkaa man vichlit ho gaya
 For a few days, he was in the dilemma that Athav became the follower of the pope
 kintu ant main unhone kalvini padri ke prabhaav se protenstant dharm grahan kar liya
 Under the patronage of these pastors, Gibbon studied and practiced French, Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, justice, mathematics, etc
 with great care
 france ke suprasiddh sahityakar boltere se giban kaa isi kaal main parichay hua, jisase unhen vichaar vinyas main badi prerana mili
 Meanwhile, being attracted to a French noble girl, Gibbon wanted to marry her, but she gave up her resolve due to her father's opposition
 is ghatana ke sambandh main giban ne apni atmakatha main ye maarmik shabd prayukt kiye hai ki usne putr kii tarah pita kii ajna kaa paalan kiya or premi kii tarah viyog kii aah bhari

 Gibbon then traveled to Europe

 It took Gibbon 15 years to complete this treatise

 Vivid descriptions and explanations of many pithy events are available in interesting language
 giban kii udaar kalpana, vishisht buddhi, prachur khoj, satat parishram or manohar shabdavinyas kaa is mahati pustak main sarvatra parichay miltaa he
 Two centuries had passed since the publication of this treatise, meanwhile, the explorations of archaeologists made historiography very advanced and thriving, but still this unique book did not become old
 pro friman kaa mat he ki itihaas main chaahe or kuch padhaa jaae yaa na padhaa jaae, giban avashya padhaa janaa chahie
 Similarly, Frederick Harrison is of the opinion that just as it was mentioned at the door of Aflatun's academy that the one who has not proved geometry should not enter here, similarly the ideal school of history should carve the phrase at its lion door that Gibbon Entry here is prohibited without proving
 saransh yah ki giban kii yah pustak itihaas ke sampurna sahitya main adwitiya nahin to chotii ke gine chune granthon main se he
 In the last days, Giban composed his biography, which from the point of view of literary art, even from the above mentioned historical book, many critics seem to have importance
 giban ke granthon kii bhashaa badi manji hui he
 The sentences and phrases, despite being long and long-lasting, are so intertwined and formulated from beginning to end and they have such a melodious sum of words and vowels that the reader gets a taste of the instrument

 The last days of Gibbon's life were spent in sickness and anxiety

 In the context of Gibbon, there is a famous joke that despite Gibbon, he started considering himself as the Roman Empire

 On the way, he recalled the hospitals and asked them to reach that place

 nagar brahmano ke kuldev -hatakeshwar mahadev maryarhaghantdilidag hatakenvinirmitamakhyartiyasyati sarvatrapatale hatakeswaram It is a matter of very ancient times, in the saruparpena-rich forest area near Uttar Pradesh i
e
 Dwarka, the sage Muni lived with his homemaker religion by making his own deciduous and following the Vedic religion, the practice of Yajnyadagik Kriya, Vedo by the Vedopanishad and Lord Pritayarth flourished in exile by performing various types of austerities, Agnihotra Agnisham etc
 Doors used to, spend their time
 usee samay kii baat he ki sati viyog se vyathit kailashpati shankar nagnavastha me ghoomte phirte usee aanart pradesh main aa pahuche
 Seeing the golden Saddash and Tejpunjaya body of Lord Shankar, the wisdom of the wives of sage sages became disenchanted and forgetting all the business, they started looking at Shankar
 apni patnio kii yah sthiti dekh rishi muni atyant khinn ho uthe or krodhavash me sadashiv shankar ko shraap diya ki tumne hamaare ashram ko dooshit kiya he, isiilie yah ling prithvi par sheeghra hi gir padega
 Seeing this, Shankar's penis settled on the earth and at the same time, after tearing the penis surface, he settled in the hell
 kailashpati sadashiv shankar ko isse khed hua or lajjawash usee kshan se gupt vaas karne lage
 Along with making a secret abode to Lord Shankar, many disturbances, disturbances and leprosy started on earth
 yah sab dekh rishi muni tathaa prithvivasi bhaybheet ho uthe
 It seemed as if the Holocaust had arrived
 sabhi rishi muni evam devatagan bramhaji ke paas pahuuche or unki stuti kii, unhe prasann kiya or prithvi par ho rahe utpaado kaa kaaran poocha
 Bramhaji became samadhi and knew the cause of that product and told Munio that it is not a symptom of holocaust but it is all due to his condition and sad condition caused by the curse of the sages, the fall of Sadashiv Shankar's penis
 phir bramhaji ne swayan saare devataao muniyon ke saath shri vishnu bhagwaan kii stuti kii or vishnu sahit saare muni devtaa tathaa bramha aanart pradesh main pahuuche
 Everyone praised Sadashiva Shankar
 vandana kar unhen prasann karne kaa upaay shuru kiya or jab shankar prasann hue tab unhen sansar ke dukh tathaa utpaadon kaa samaran dilaayaa
 Kailashpati Sadashiv Shankar said that the disconnection of Sati caused me great distress and for this reason i wished to corrupt the place of this sex and i wandered in the forest groves in the form of Digambar and reached this state of Uttar Pradesh and here due to the curse of sages and sages This is the reason i have renounced this gender
 sadashiv shankar kii yah baat sunakar bramhan vishnu tathaa anya devataao ne unase vinay ke saath kaha ki aap sati ke liye shok na karen himalay main menka ke yaho parvati kaa janm hoga or vah parvati hi aapaki sati he jise aap grahan kar prasann honge
 Therefore, you should undo this gender
 shankar ne ling dhaaran karne ke purv devataaon se kaha ki yadi aaj se bramn log vidhipurvak ling kaa pujan karengen tabhi main ise dhaaran karuunga
 Therefore Brahmnau himself said that we too will be happy to worship your sex
 vaise aapke ling kii sansar main puja hogi or prithvivasi aapke ling kii puja kar apana jeevanyaapan kar prasannataa ko praapt hongen
 Then Shankar rejoiced the Linga and Brahma, Vishnu and other deities made a Hatak or gold linga, installed it at the same place in the palatal and worshiped it with scripture and worshiped Lord Shankar and worshiped Lord Shiva on earth
 Prevented the current crisis by increasing the magnitude of phir bramhanau vishnu tathaa anya devtaa apane apane log main chale gaye
 Since then, the significance of Shivalinga has increased in the world and the product of the earth has calmed down
 jis ling kaa bramhaji ne sthapana kiya yah shri hatakeshwar mahadev ke naam se prasiddh hua or nagaron ke kul devtaa maane gaye
 Hatakeshwar Temple -


 

 In the Puranas of Gujarat, it is mentioned that the land of Vadnagar was presented to the Nagro as a mark of gratitude by the king
 raja ko ek hiran ko markar swayam v apane putro ko khilne karn galtv muni dwaara ek abhishaap ke kaaran jo shwet kusht ho gaya raja ne nagar sabha se karuna kii yachana kii, krinavrt dhari nagar ne rajake kashton kaa jadi bootiyon or prakritik dawaaon 


ke apane gyaan kii madad se ilaaj kiya gaya
 The king would like to donate the country to the wonders, but did not accept the reward of Karna king for not valuing his mercy! The 72 families of Nagar Brahmanas were of high principles, who did not accept the donation Six families accepted the gift after persuasion from the queen of King Miracle, but 66 families who did not accept the gift of Raza left their country and their descendants sixty
 They used to take their clan in the trains, hence they are called Sathotra gotra Even today, he is revered for his sacrifice and ideals

 Sathotras are called! One day in the journey, from which place the bullock cart on the banks of Kanthal and Kalisindh at the fork of Malwa and Rajasthan, with your favorite and Kuldev Lord Hatakeshwar After the rest of the night to the moving Shivling form of the morning, if everyone is ready to walk, then the bullock cart in which Lord Hatkeshwar sits as a murti They were unable to move forward even after a lot of effort, knowing the will of the Lord, all the civilians started worshiping their favored god! Dear people are hungry and go and give food to those Brahmins, Maharana immediately informs his local representative, When the representative of Maharana Udising instructed his messengers and he wanted to give food and food to the civilians, then all of them said that they will not take food until we establish our Ishta Dev, when Maharana Udasinga finds out He gave the title of Rajbhat to all the citizens, and after sending the Rajpurohit, made a Shivling in Soyat Kalan and arranged for cow, land and food etc
 Every year, Hatkeshwar Jai At the same place on the earth, all will meet together and discuss each other and in the temple place here, by appointing a kinsman to worship, this is why all the civilians proceeded in search of their livelihood, today, the same virtuous shlok east and their favorite and kuldev With the grace of Lord Hatkeshwar, today we are all fully skilled Mars!

 Every year, everyone would meet together at this place on the Hatkeshwar Jayanti and discuss it and appoint a family member to worship at the temple place, This is why all the civilians moved forward in search of their livelihood, today, by virtue of the same virtuous shlok puranjo and their favored and patriarch Lord Hatakeshwar, today we All is perfectly skilled Mars! May God Hatkeshwar always maintain his loving kindness on us all! surya grahan ek tarah kaa grahan he jab chandramaa, prithvi or surya ke madhya se hokar gujarata he tathaa prithvi se dekhne par surya purna athwa aanshik rup se chandramaa dwaara aachhadit hota he
 In terms of physics, when the moon comes between the Sun and the Earth, the image of the Sun behind the Moon gets covered for some time, the same phenomenon is called Solar Eclipse
 prithvi suraj kii parikrama karti he or chaand prithvi kii
 Sometimes the moon comes between the sun and the earth
 phir vah suraj kii kuch yaa sari roshni roak letaa he jisase dharti par saaya fail jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called solar eclipse
 yah ghatana sadaa sarvada amavasya ko hi hoti he
 Often the moon covers only a part of the sun
 yah sthiti khand-grahan kehalaati he
 Sometimes it happens that the moon completely covers the sun
 ise purna-grahan kehete hai
 Complete eclipse can be seen only in a very small area of the earth
 zyaada se zyaada do sau pachaas kilometre ke sampark main
 Outside this region only the eclipse is visible
 purna-grahan ke samay chaand ko suraj ke saamne se guzarane main do ghante lagate hai
 The moon covers the sun completely, at most, for seven minutes
 in kuch kshanon ke liye aasmaan main andhera ho jaataa he, yaa yun kahen ki din main raat ho jaati he
 Eclipse is a wonderful miracle of nature
 jyotish ke drushtikon se yadi dekha jaae to abhootpurv anokhaa, vicitra jyotish gyaan, grah or upgrahon kii gatividhiyaan evam unka swaroop spasht karata he
 Solar eclipse occurs when the sun is partially or completely covered by the moon
 is prakaar ke grahan ke liye chandama kaa prithvi or surya ke bich aana aavashyak he
 Due to this, people living on the earth do not see the covered part of the sun
 uttari dhruv ko dakshini dhruv se milaane vaali rekhaon ko rekhaansh kaha jaataa he tathaa bumadhya rekha ke chaaro vrutakar main jane vaali rekhaon ko ankshash ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The solar eclipse always occurs on the new moon
 jab chandramaa kshintam ho or surya purna kshamta sampann tathaa deept hon
 The longitude of Moon and Rahu or Ketu must be very close
 chandra kaa akshansh lagbhag shunya hona chaiye or yah tab hoga jab chandra ravimaarg par yaa ravimaarg ke nikat hon, surya grahan ke din surya or chandra ke koniya vyas ek samaan hote hai
 For this reason, the moon is able to take the sun in its shadow only for a few minutes
 surya grahan ke samay jo kshetra dhak jaataa he use purna chaaya kshetra kehete hai
 There are three types of solar eclipse, which are called full solar eclipse, partial solar eclipse and annular eclipse because of the covering of the whole or less part of the image of the sun by the moon
 purna surya grahan us samay hota he jab chandramaa prithvi ke kaafii paas rahete hue prithvi or surya ke bich main aa jaataa he or chandramaa puri tarah se prithvi ko apane chaaya kshetra main le letaa he
 As a result, the sun's light does not reach the earth and a dark condition arises on the earth when the whole sun is not visible on the earth
 is prakaar banane vaala grahan purna surya grahan kehalaata he
 In partial solar eclipse, when the moon comes between the sun and the earth in such a way that only a part of the sun is not visible from the earth, that is, the moon is able to take only some part of the sun in its shadow
 isse surya kaa kuch bhaag grahan grass main tathaa kuch bhaag grahan se aprabhavit rahata he to prithvi ke us bhaag vishesh main laga grahan aanshik surya grahan kehalaata he
 In the annular solar eclipse, when the moon is far away from the earth, it comes between the earth and the sun, that is, the moon covers the sun in such a way that only the central part of the sun comes in the shadow area and when viewed from the earth by the moon The Sun does not appear completely covered, but the area outside the Sun appears to shine as a bracelet or ring
 kangan aakaar main bane suryagrahan ko hi valayakaar surya grahan kehalaata he
 Astronomers have determined from mathematics that 41 solar eclipses and 29 lunar eclipses occur in a period of 18 years and 18 days
 ek varsh main 5 suryagrahan tathaa 2 chandragrahan tak ho sakate hai
 But there should be 2 solar eclipses in a year
 haan, yadi kisi varsh 2 hi grahan hue to wo dono hi suryagrahan honge
 Although up to 7 eclipses are possible throughout the year, more than 4 eclipses are rarely seen
 prayek grahan 18 varsh 11 din biit jane par pun: hota he
 But it is not certain that he should be in his first place, because the point of wealth is constantly moving
 saadharantay suryagrahan kii apeksha chandragrahan adhik dekhe jate hai, parantu sachai yah he ki chandra grahan se kahin adhik suryagrahan hote hai
 The ratio of 4 solar eclipses is 3 lunar eclipses
 chandragrahanon ke adhik dekhe jane kaa kaaran yah hota he ki ve prithvi ke aadhe se adhik bhaag main dikhalaai passage hai, jab ki suryagrahan prithvi ke bahut bade bhaag main praaia sau mile se kam chode or do se teen hajaar mile lambe bhubhag main dikhalaai passage hai
 For example, if there is an eclipse in Madhya Pradesh, then the solar eclipse will be visible only in Gujarat and in North India it will not be visible
 chaahe grahan kaa koi aadhyatmik mahatva ho athwa na ho kintu duniya bhar ke vaigyanikon ke liye yah avasar kisi utsav se kam nahin hota
 Because eclipse is the time when many unique and wonderful events happen in the brahmand, so that scientists get an opportunity to work on new new facts
 1968 main larkyar naamak vaigyanik nen surya grahan ke avasar par kii gai khoj ke sahare varna mandal main helium gas kii upasthiti kaa pataa lagaaya tha
 This rendering of Einstein was also proved right on the occasion of solar eclipse, in which he talked about the light falling from the gravity of other bodies
 chandragrahan to apane sampurna tatkaaleen prakaash kshetra main dekha ja saktaa he kintu suryagrahan adhiktam 10 hajaar kilometre lambe or 250 kilometre chode kshetra main hi dekha ja saktaa he
 The actual duration of the total solar eclipse can be only 11 minutes and not more than that
 sansar ke samast padaarthon kii sanrachana surya rashmiyon ke madhyam se hi sambhav he
 If the effects of the Sun and its signs are properly understood, amazing results can be achieved on the whole earth
 surya kii prayek rashmi vishesh anu kaa pratinidhitiv karti he or jaisaa ki spasht he, prayek padaarth kisi vishesh parmaanu se hi nirmit hota he
 Now, if the sun's zodiacs are capitalized and focused on a particular point, then the action of changing the material can also be possible
 vaidic kaal se purv bhi khagoleey sanrachana par aadhaarit kalainder banane kii aavashkata anubhav kii gai
 Prior information about solar eclipse, lunar eclipse and their recurrence was available only before four thousand BC
 rugveda ke anusaar atrimuni ke parivaar ke paas yah gyaan uplabdh tha
 The importance of Vedanga astrology reflects this great knowledge of our Vedic ancestors
 grah nakshatron kii duniya kii yah ghatana bhartiya manishiyon ko atyant pracheen kaal se gyaat rahi he
 In ancient times, the Maharishi had calculated it
 is par dharmik, vaidic, vaicharik, vaigyanik vivechan dharmik evam jyotishiya granthon main hota chalaa aayaa he
 Maharishi Artrimuni was the first teacher to impart knowledge of eclipse
 rigvedic prakaash kaal arthath vaidic kaal se grahan par adhyayan, manan or pareekshan hote chale aae hai
 Our sages have forbidden food at the time of solar eclipse, because they believed that during the time of eclipse, germs spread with abundance
 khaadya vastu, jal aadi main sookshm jeevanu ekatrit hokar use dooshit kar dete hai
 So the sages have asked the characters to put kush, so that all the germs get collected in the kush and they can be thrown after the eclipse
 paatro main agni daalkar unhen pavitra banaaya jaataa he taaki keetanu mar jaaen
 The law of bathing after the eclipse was made so that during the bath the heat flow inside the body increases, the germs inside and outside are destroyed and washed away
 puraanon kii manyata ke anusaar rahu chandramaa ko tathaa ketu surya ko grasata he
 They are both children of the shadow
 chandramaa or surya kii chaaya ke saath-saath chalate hai
 At the time of lunar eclipse, the predominance of phlegm increases and the power of the mind decreases, while at the time of solar eclipse, the power of jathragni, eye and bile weaken
 garbhvatee stri ko surya-chandra grahan nahin dekhne chahie, kyonki uske dushprabhav se shishu angahin hokar viklang ban saktaa he, garbhpaat kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 For this, a paste of cow dung and basil is applied in the abdominal part of the pregnant, so that rahu-ketu does not touch it
 grahan ke dauraan garbhvatee mahila ko kuch bhi kanchi yaa chaaku se kaatane ko manaa kiya jaataa he or kisi vastradi ko silne se roka jaataa he
 Because it is believed that by doing this, the baby's parts are either cut or sewn
 grahan lagane ke purv nadi yaa ghar main uplabdh jal se snaan karke bhagwaan kaa pujan, yajna, jap karnaa chahie
 Make good use of the time of eclipse by performing bhajan-kirtan
 grahan ke dauraan koi kaary na karen
 Chanting of mantras at the time of eclipse achieves accomplishment
 grahan kii avadhi main tel lagaana, bhojan karnaa, jal pinaa, mel-mutr tyaag karnaa, kesh vinyas bananaa, rati-krida karnaa, manjan karnaa varjit kiye gaye hai
 Some people also bathe during the eclipse
 grahan samaapt ho jane par snaan karke brahman ko daan dene kaa vidhaan he
 There is also a rule to wash clothes and utensils at some places

 bharat main nimnlikhit rajnatik dalon kaa gathbandhan he
 Dardi or Dardic languages are a subdivision of indo-aryan languages, whose most well-known language is Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaayen uttari pakistan, uttar-purvi afghanistan or bharat ke jammu-kashmir rajya main boli jaatin hai
 Among all the Dardi languages, the status of Kashmiri is the highest because it has its own popular literature and also has the honor of being an official language of India
 pakistan ke chitral zile kii khovaar bhashaa, uttari kashmir main boli jane vaali shina bhashaa or afghanistan ke purvi nuristaan, nangarhaar or kunar rajyon main boli jane vaali pashai bhashaa anya mashhoor dardi bhashaayen hai
 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'drisha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"
 sakranti kaa arth he, 'surya kaa ek raashi se algi raashi main sankraman '
 So there are a total of 12 solstices throughout the year
 andhra pradesh, telungan, karnataka, maharashtra, tamilnadu, kerala, urisa, punjab or gujarat main sakranti ke din hi maas kaa armbh hota he
 Whereas in Bengal and Assam, the end of the month is considered as the day of Sankranti

 There is a dubious legend that Cheraman Perumal had accepted Islam and traveled to Mecca from where he sent a message to the rulers of India to welcome Muslims and build mosques
 lekin is katha ko aitihaasik satya nahin mana ja saktaa
 In fact, Cherman Perumal visited Chidambaram
