 Thermal efficiency is used to measure the efficiency of devices using thermal energy
 duusare shabdo main kaha ja saktaa he ki upkaran main urja kaa sthaanantaran kitni acchhee tarah se kiya ja paa rahaa he, isaki maap uski dakshata ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Generally, in the context of any body, the ratio of useful output energy and input energy is called energy efficiency
 jab ooshmiya urja kii baat karte hai tab kisi yukti ko di gayi ooshmiya urja yaa us yukti dwaara khapat kii gayi kul urja q i n { \ displaystyle Q_{in}} uskaa input hota he jabaki vaanchit output, us yukti dwaara kiya gaya yantric kaary w o u t { \ displaystyle W_{out}}, yaa q o u t { \ displaystyle Q_{out}}, yaa donon hote hai
 We know that energy is not available in the same way, it has some financial value, so the general definition of thermal efficiency is as follows- ooshmaagatiki ke pratham niyam ke anusaar, output urja kabhi bhi input urja se adhik nahin ho sakati
 Therefore saamaanya rup se kisi upkaran main urja kii khapat kaa anupaat uske dwaara utpaadit bal kii tulana main kitna he isko is tarah se samajha ja saktaa he ki kisi antardahan ingine main eendhan jalataa he to usase na keval jenerator chal kar bijli banati he balki is prakriya main ingine chalaane ke liye indhan ko jalaayaa jaataa he jisase ingine chalen ke saath jo garmi paidaa hoti he vah bhi uske ek utpaada ke rup main utpann hoti he, yah garmi jitani adhik hogi utana hi bijli banane kii kshamta ko kam karegi
 In this way, the production of energy cannot be greater than the fuel burned in any way
 yadi ise anupaat main vyakt kiya jaye to tapiya-kshamta 0%se 100% ke bich rahegi, kintu anek prakaar kii aakshamtao, jaise- gharshan, taap-haani aadi ke kaaran yah kshamta 100% nahin hoti
 Petrol-engines, for example, operate at 25% efficiency, while large coal-fired power stations produce up to 40% capacity, and large diesel engines are capable of generating up to 51

 In this, various components of knowledge, abilities, thinking, and personality are measured

 There are two main research works under psychometry - ji dablyoo alport ne vyaktitv kii lagbhag 50 paribhaashaon kii talika prastut kii he jinase se kuch hi iske manovaigyanik paksh se sambhddha hai or ye bhi pun: aisi lakshanon par bal detii prathit hoti hai, jaise vyakti ke saamaajik uddipak mulya or vyakti ke aantaravaiyaktik sanghathan
 According to popular belief, the word "personality" is used as an indicator of a person's social stimulating value
 isse taatpary us sampurna prabhaav se he jo ek vyakti dusron par daalata he, arthath vyakti us prayek stri purush ke liye jiske sampark main vah aata he ek uddipak ke rup main kaary karata he
 The social stimulating value of a person includes his / her personal characteristics, his / her specific behavior and his / her own specific way of reacting to the immediate environment
 uddipak ke rup main kriyasheel rahete hue vyakti par un parsparik kriyaaon kaa bhi satat prabhaav rahata he jinka vah apane tathaa anya vyaktiyon ke bich upakraman karata he
 These consequential powers produce changes that affect the articulation of one's own, other persons, and situations
 duusare shabdon main, vyakti apane ko andar se dekhtaa he or sanghathan, arthath ekta or sthirataa utpann karke apane aantar vaiyaktik swabhaav main apni aatmdharna kaa vikaas karata he
 Personality is generally called "soul" or "ego" when viewed from an individualistic point of view
 iske antargat vyakti kii bauddhik, samvegatmak sanrachanaayen, unki yogyataayen or abhivrittiyaan, ruchiyan, pasandgi or naapsandgi aati hai
 It is visible that in addition to the conscious, such subliminal elements are sometimes included in the individual personal organization of the individual
 jinase vah swayan avgat nahin hota
 Several methods have been proposed as being measurable and understandable on both social and internal personal aspects of personality
 phir bhi, inamen se prayek vidhi ke kuch gun or kuch dosha hai
 The major titles under which these methods can be listed are as follows: saanskrithik prishthbhumi ke adhyayan; daihik vrutt; saamaajik vrutt; vyaktigat vrutt; abhivyanjanatmak gatiyaan; yogyatakram nirdhaaran; maansik pareekshan; laghu jivan sthitiyaan; sankhyikeey vishleshan; prayogshaala ke prayog; pragukti; gahan vishleshan; adarsh prakaar or sanshlisht vidhiyaan
 These methods have been subdivided into a number of other techniques whose utility poses problems of reliability and validity as general evaluation methods must be reliable and accurate
 vyaktitv moolyankan or anusandhan sambandhi california institute ne sanyukt rajya america main vyaktitv ke manovaigyanik pareekshanon ke prayog kii samalochna karne ke pashchaat 62 maansik pareekshanon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he jinamein se kuch kii charchaa neeche kii ja rahi he
 Five out of ten major tests are intelligence and four are projective tests
 dasven pareekshan kaa naam minesota multipagic vyaktitv inventry he
 It is a psychometric technique used to describe clinical types of personality, namely to diagnose patients under different psychiatric categories
 prakshepiy pareekshanon kaa prayog vyaktitv kii gahan abhivyaktiyon arthath kisi vyakti main antarnihit un vyaktigat or prakruti vaishishtyajanya arthon tathaa sanghathanon kii, jo anya kisi prakaar se prakat nahin hote, jaankaree praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Rorsha testing is a projective technique based on the analysis of inertial spots
 yah manoranjak he ki rorsha pareekshan kaa prayog karanevaale sthanon tathaa vyavhaar pariman donon hi drushtiyon se rorsha apane anya pratidwandviyon se spasht aage he
 The purpose of intelligence examination is to depict the abilities of the person that make it possible to prosecute the whole environment or its various aspects
 vyaktitv ke sanghatakon kii gananaa karte samay anek manovaigyanik buddhi ko pramukh sthaan dete hai
 In the presence of such a problem, which can be solved in many ways, the way a person uses his intelligence reflects his personality formation
 spearman kaa sadaiv yahi mat rahaa he ki buddhi ek saamaanya maansik yogyata he
 He believed that a fundamental action or action is equally present in all intellectual pursuits and that intelligence is essentially a rational thinking
 yah ek prakaar ke saamaanya "shakti" tatv ke samaan hota he jo buddhi ko apni saamaanya shakti kaa vyavhaar karne main sakasham banaata he
 Yet they have also accepted some special abstract skills or "dm" elements, although they derive externally and limitedly only from the "nad" element
 spearman ke is saamaanya tatvasiddhant ke viruddh buddhi ke ek bahutatva siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya
 The principal promoter of this theory, Kelly, states that "kr" is not the only object, as it is called, but under this element there are special groups of similar abilities
 udhaaharan ke liye, apane amoort kshetra ke antargat, buddhi samaklit vishesh pakshon, jaise smriti, sthangat sambandh, shabdic or aankik samaj, samaj kii gati ityadi, kaa sanmishran ho sakati he
 It is visible that later psychologists have proved this hypothesis based on similar proposals
 buddhi ke antargat, jaisaa ise adhikansh manovaigyanikon ne samajha he, ve sab yogyataayen aa jaati hai, jinke dwaara gyaan kaa arjan, dhaaran tathaa kisi samasya ke samaadhaan main vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 It also complements the abilities of perceiving, learning, memory, imagination etc
 kintu yat: vibhinn prakaar kii yogyataon kaa thik thik nirdhaaran nishrchit rup se kathin he, at: buddhi kii kisi bhi paribhaasha kaa itnaa adhik vistrut hona anivaary he ki uskaa bahut vyaavhaarik mahatv nahin rah jaataa
 Nevertheless, psychologists have developed at least three types of metaphors
 amoort buddhi kii aavashyaktaa vrittik vyaktiyon, jaise vakeelon, chikitsakon, saahitiyik vyaktiyon or vyavsaayiyon, rajmarmagyon, tathaa isi prakaar ke logon kii hoti he
 Engineers, skilled mechanics, trained industrial workers, cartographers, etc
 all need to be mechanically empowered, and diplomats, salespeople, preachers and consultants must be socially intelligent
 amoort buddhi pratikon ke sambandhon ko samajhane se tathaa unke sarthak vyavhaar se sambhddha hoti he
 Tests designed to measure these intangible abilities are commonly called "general intelligence tests"
 in pareekshanon ko prayukt saamagree or aavashyak pratikriyaaon kii drushti se do shreniyon ke antargat vargeekrut kiya gaya he--shabdic buddhi pareekshan tathaa ashabdic buddhipareekshan
 a person's intelligence is decided on the basis of the index which he achieves in the use of his literal ability, reading and writing, in the solution of a problem
 ashabdic pareekshan prahelikaon, bhulbhulaiyon, chitron or rekhachitron, ke rup main kisi samasya ko upasthit karte hai or parikshya vyakti ko saadhaaran chinhon dwaara athwa jod todakar apana samaadhaan prastut karnaa padataa he
 Mechanical intelligence, in general, implies an above average ability to work with tangible objects rather than linguistic symbols
 hastkaushal tathaa gatyaatmak samanvay kii kshamta se yukt vyakti yantric sadhano ko jodne todane main praveen hote hai
 Mechanical aptitude tests are those used to evaluate this type of intelligence
 saamaajik buddhi se us prabhaavshaalee aantaravaiyaktik yogyata sambandh se taatpary he jo vaanchit abhishton kii prapti ko sugam banaata he
 Socially intelligent person possesses the art and expertise of maintaining a smooth relationship with other persons
 anya prakaaron ke antargat abhivritti pareekshanon dwaara saamaajik buddhi main antarnihit saamaajik pravritiyon kii maap hoti hai
 Nevertheless, the above three aspects of intellectual behavior also have such sufficient individual differences and the constructed tests cannot eliminate all the diversity and richness of mental abilities within their range
 kintu "pareekshanon" dwaara praapt suchakank ke antargat manovaigyanik shodh ke aaj ke dhaanche kii seemaa main nishpaksh rup se praapt sangat soochna kaa samast kshetra aa jaataa he
 It has been more productive of elements than the approach theory, and perhaps that is its power
 aitihaasik drushti se buddhipareekshan main ruchi kaa aarambh us samay hua jab shaikshanik kaarykram ke antargat vidhyaarthiyon kii yogyata ke nirdhaaran kii shaikshik paathyacharya kii praayogic aavashyaktaa prathit hui
 In 1904, a commission was set up to determine the recommendations regarding the arrangement of special classes for the mentally retarded children in public schools in France
 vahaan ke manovaigyanik alfred bine sadsy niyukt hue
 This appointment gave him the opportunity to experiment with some of the tests he and his colleague Simon were developing
 saamaanya balak or mandabuddhi balak kaa vibhed karne ke liye kisi thik thik madhyam ke nirmaan main in logon kii pradhan ruchi thi
 Galton's research on individual discrimination helped in the development of Binke's concepts
 vibhinn avasthaa ke vyaktiyon kii tulana tathaa ek hi umr ke vibhinn vyaktiyon kii tulana karne ke liye bine ne ek buddhipareekshan kaa nirmaan kiya
 Development of the test showed that there could be many tasks that children of any stage, such as a ten-year-old child, were capable of doing, when relatively young children were certainly unable to complete them
 yadi koi balak koi aisa kaary kar saktaa he, jise 10 varsh ke adhiktar balak kar sakate hai, to us balak kii "maansik vay" 10 varsh maani jaaygi, chaahe uski vaastavik umr chah, aath, athwa 14 varsh ho
 Suppose if the mental age of an eight-year-old boy is 10 years old, he will be called acutely - two years more intensely - according to his condition
 duusari ore 14 varsh kii vaastavik umravaale balak kii yadi maansik vay keval 10 varsh ho to use chaar varsh pichhadaa, yaa mand, kahenge
 Bine himself amended his test twice and his final test came out in 1911
 bine ke pareekshan ke isi antim rup kaa eldru emdru terman ne stempord vishvavidhyalay main prayog kiya jahaan bine pareekshan ke teen stempord parishkar hue
 The first came out in 1916, the second in 1937 and the third in 1959
 bine kii "maansik vay" kaa parimarjan kiya gaya or balak kii maansik umr ko uski varshaayu se bhaag dekar usamen 100 se guna karke buddhi uplabdh nikalne kaa prastaav kiya gaya

 In general, the objective has been to arrange the standard in such a way that the intellect achievement of a child remains constant even after his age increases
 stempord bine pareekshan kaa adhiktar prayog chaar se 14 varsh kii seemaa ke bheetar ke baalkon ke liye hi hota he
 a test designed primarily for adult measurement is called the "wexler Bellevue Value Scale"

 Thus a person of 50 years who is 125 c
 In general, how much 125 ° c will be said to be equally superior to other people of 50 years
 The person receiving 30 years will be better than the other 30 years
 stempord-bine tathaa vectiolar bellevue, donon hi pareekshan vaiyaktik pareekshan hai or inase ek samay main ek hi balak yaa vayask kaa pareekshan kiya ja saktaa he
 But in addition to these there are other individual tests and there are also tests that can be used collectively on multiple people at once
 kalkram kii drushti se bharat main vyaktitvapareekshan kii apeksha buddhipareekshanon kaa aarambh pehle hua
 The first attempt was made by Herbert Seed Rice in Lahore in 1922 to prepare foreign trials to suit Indian conditions
 unhone budhimaapan ke bine scale par kaary karte hue keval baalkon ke liye urdu or punjabi main "hindustani bine parfamens point scale" kaa nirmaan kiya
 Later in 1935, in Bombay for both boys and girls, Virudh Pardh Kamath composed the Bine scale in Marathi and Kannada
 bine scale ke parimarjan baad main banglaa, hindustani, tamil or telugu tathaa hindi main bhi nikle
 In addition to this, many other adaptations to the Stafford scour were treated
 in parimarjanon ke atirikt, elahabaad ke sohanlal ne san 1952 main vidhyalay main padhanevaale baalkon ke liye hindi or urdu main samuhik buddhipareekshan kaa or elahabaad ke hi sidru emdru bhaatia ne san 1945 main bharatiyon ke liye buddhi ke kriyaatmak pareekshan kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1927, Jared Henry of Allahabad Inving Christian College created the first literal mass test to adapt to Indian conditions
 inkaa primary clacification pareekshan, shaikshik or buddhipareekshanon kaa sanmishran tha or yah hindi, urdu tathaa angreji main taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 In 1933, Lajashankar Jha of Kashi Hindu University published the Hindi adaptation of Richardsen's "ciplex Mental Test" and then worked on Terman's "group Test of Mental Ability" for the age group of simplex testing itself
 inke baad esadru jalota or lahore ke aradri aradri kumaria, lakhanu ke eldru kedri shahdri, madras ke sidru tidru philip, patna ke esadru emdru mohsin aadi ne bharat main shabdic samuhik pareekshanon ke nirmaan kii disha main yogadan diya he
 The first attempt in India towards personality testing was done by Beed Maludru of Lahore
 inaki "vyaktitv prashnawali" kaa uddeshy kishaaron ke samvegatmak pareekshanon ko unki nirmanvidhi ke aadhaar par teen upvargon main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he jo is prakaar hai : prashnawali, prakshepiy pareekshan tathaa kramanirdhaaran maan
 The questionnaire method has been used by most Indian psychologists in this area
 inamen se kuch naam ye hai--mysore ke bidru kuppuswami, banaras ke esadru jalota, lakhanu ke echdru esadru asthana, banaras ke emdru esadru eldru saxena elahabaad ke didru sinaha, elahabaad kii manovigyaanshakha, kalakatta kaa shaikshanik or manovaigyanik anusandhan beuro, bihar kaa shaikshik or vyavsaayik nirdesan beuro ityadi
 At present, substantial work is being done in the direction of personality testing in most of our Indian universities by questionnaire method
 bharat main vyaktitv ke prakshepiy pareekshan ke prayog ke liye ham elahabad kii manovigyaan shaala dwaara chrrichr ke anukulan tathaa yudru paarikh dwaara rojenvig ke pikchar frestrishan pareekshan kaa ullekh kar sakate hai
 Rorsha test is being used most by students in many Indian universities for their educational needs
 vyaktitv pareekshan ke liye kramanirdhaaran maan vidhi ke prayogon ke sambandh main shri jamuna prasad ke "vyaktitv abhiyojan sambandhi kramanirdhaaran maan" kaa ullekh kiya ja saktaa he
 Intellectuals are abstract measurements of intelligence that represent common mental abilities
 is mat ke pravarttak yah vishwaas karte hai ki sahaayak shaikshanik nitiyon ke dwaara saamaanya buddhi kaa pareekshan maatr vidhyaarthiyon ko kisi vyavsaay ke liye aavashyak he
 Such a viewpoint is opposed by psychologists who insist on the specificity of habit or the specificity of competence, saying that there is no such thing as intelligence, but instead there are many Buddhas which consist of other types of abilities other than abstraction
 Huh
 yah tathy ki ek vyakti kisi ek kaaryakshetra ke liye yogyata rakhata he, is baat kii pratyabhuti nahin he ki vah kaary ke anya kshetron main bhi utana hi yogya hoga
 Therefore, in the interest of purity, it is only appropriate that the word "wise" be reserved to describe specific behaviors in specific situations
 kabhi vyakti budhimattapurvak or kabhi moorkhtaapurvak vyavhaar karata he
 Numerous studies have been done to sort out the qualifications of human beings by a detailed numerical method known as "causal analysis"
 bhashaatmak, yantric, kalatmak, sangitatmak, lipic tathaa pushtakayik aadi sarvaadhik uplabdh vishisht yogyataayen hai
 We can see from our day-to-day experience that one person, despite being proficient in one of these qualifications, is inferior or backward in others
 abhivritti se hamaara taatpary kisi kaushal vishesh main napunya praapt karne kii vyakti kii aprakat or aviksit yogyata se he
 Therefore, tests specifically designed to measure attitudes attempt to make possible predictions of the efficacy of future capabilities
 at: bhavi nishpattiyon ke purvakthanmak pareekshan vibhinn yogyataon se sambhddha hote hai, at: kaary ke vibhinn kshetron kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye anek abhivrittipareekshanon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 Thus we have available general mechanical, clerical, musical and other aptitude tests
 pratham vishwayuddh ke pashchaat nirmit "minesota form board" pareekshan kaa ullekh yantric yogyata ke maapan ke sarvaadhik vaid madhyam ke rup main kiya gaya he
 In it, two dimensions cut into different parts are placed in front of the person drawing the test, from which he has to choose a drawing which consists of exactly the parts shown in the original drawing
 yah pareekshan un yantric yogyataon kaa maapan karata he jo sthangat vastuon ke pratyakshikaran tathaa jodne todane kii prakriya se sambhddha hoti hai
 With respect to other aptitude tests, it can be said that there is no dearth of specific qualifying examples
 abhiruchiyon kii vyaktitv ke un preranaatmak pakshon kaa abhivyanjak kaha gaya he jinka vikaas anubhoot aavashyaktaaon se hota he
 Many individuals see the same ability for a wide variety of tasks, but there is a clear difference in their interest towards them
 yah nirvivaad he ki ham usee vyavsaay main kisi vyakti kii santoshjanak pragati kii aashaa kar sakate hai jiske prati usamen yogyata tathaa abhiruchi donon ek saath vartmaan hon
 Therefore, by combining the measurement of interests with the measurement of abilities, the prediction of a person's success in a particular business becomes more powerful
 anek abhiruchi prashnawaliyon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya jinamein "cuder prefrence record pramukh he
 This questionnaire attempts to evaluate a person's interest in a variety of tasks
 yah varnanaatmak maan he jisamen parikshya vyakti ko teen sambhav kriyaaon se sambhddha prayek pad ke anusaar apni ruchi ko--kise vah sabase adhik chahta he or kise sabase kam—vyakt karnaa padataa he
 Thus we get the measurements of each of these new areas: mechanical, computational, scientific, uncanny, artistic, literary, musical, social service and clerical
 strang kaa "vokational interest blank" ek anya bahuprayukt vyavsaayik abhiruchi talika he
 Strong's omnidirectional chart provides a measure of the power of a person's interests in the fields of fifty occupations and functions, including law, medicine, teaching, engineering, vendor work, and accounting
 abhivritti or abhiruchi kii maap kisi vyakti ke bhavi jivan kii nishpattiyon ke suchnaank pradaan karte hai
 Therefore, he needs to be guided in planning his life so that his conclusions and abilities are compatible with the needs of his place in society
 prayek manushya kii yogyataon main vaiyaktik antar hota he, at: nirdesan tabhi prabhavakar ho saktaa he jab vah shaikshik prayatnon ke aarambh main hi praapt ho sake
 This helps to classify students into classes of almost equal merit
 is prakaar vargeekrut vidhyaarthiyon kii aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye ek susanchaarit shaikshik niti kaa hona bhi aavashyak he
 Educational instruction is largely based on the intellectual aptitude of a person as measured by intelligence
 vidhyaarthee ko apana shaikshik abhisht apni abhivritti se na to bahut unchaa or na bahut nicha, varan anukool rakhane ke liye protsaahit karnaa chahie
 Apart from this, he should not be allowed to stick to any kind of interest that he has acquired while helping to develop and earn the most profitable interest
 ni:andeh, abhibhavak kii sadhansampannataa use jivan ke vibhinn kaaryon ke liye taiyaar karne main mahatvapurn sahaayak tatv hota he
 For a successful business election, it is necessary that a careful consideration of the available facts by measurement of intelligence, aptitude, aptitude and personality tendencies is done in advance
 at: buddhi ko manovaigyanik pareekshanon dwaara sarvaadhik saralata se napa ja saktaa he, at: vyavsaay ke chunaav main kisi bhi anya vishistataa kii apeksha buddhipareekshan ko adhik mahatv diya gaya he
 Nevertheless, apart from this, other types of information are also necessary
 saath hi, kuch prakaar kii vyavsaayik safalataa ke liye vyaktitv pravritiyaan jaise prabhutvasthaapan, aakramta or nishtha atyadhik mahatvapurn hoti hai
 Interaction and exchange of ideas between two or more persons is called an interview
 isamen ek yaa kai vyakti kisi ek vyakti se prashn poochhate hai or vah vyakti in prashnon ke jawaab detaa he yaa in par apni raay vyakt karata he
 Interview is also a genre of literature
 alag-alag uddeshyon se saakshaatkaar liye jate hai
 The interview process also varies according to the purpose
 saakshaatkaar bahut tarh ke ho sakate hai- Interview has been in circulation for personnel selection in industries
 yah ek pracheenatam evam sarvamaanya vidhi ke rup main prayukt hota aayaa he
 In the present era, interviews are used as a mandatory tool in all fields
 yah ummidavaar tathaa uski anukulata ko jaanch-parakhane kii ek jivant saamaajik sthiti he
 It has two sides
 in pakshon ke bich kii vaarta hi antim nirnay kaa aadhaar banati he
 Bingham and Moore consider the interview a purposeful dialogue
 inhone saakshaatkaar ko ek aisa chitra mana jiske dwaara saakshatkaraarthi ko kaary vishesh ke yogya athwa ayogy ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 At the present time there have been many changes regarding the variation of the purpose of the interview
 bhinnata ke aadhaar par saakshaatkaar kabhi chayan, kabhi manovriti, kabhi salaah to kabhi moolyankan aadi hua karata he
 Whiteless considered the interview to be a direct conversation between the applicant and the serving office bearers
 vartmaan main saakshaatkaar keval soochna prapti kaa hi saadhan nahin balki maapan kaa bhi pradhan saadhan ban gaya he
 Currently, many of its objectives have been revealed as a method of determining business compatibility
 vartmaan samay ke sandarbh main saakshaatkaar kii bhoomika ek shikshak tathaa saakshatkaraarthi ke vyavhaar main prachlankartta evam vaartalap ke sukomal protsaahanakartta ke rup main ubharne lagi he
 The interview method has the advantage that applicants are not able to give incorrect responses easily
 saakshaatkaar kii paristhiti yadi sugathit hoti he to yah ek utprerak kaa bhi kaam kar sakati he
 This is the only source of information
 saakshaatkaar ke samay aavedak yah sanket khojataa rahata he ki baatcheet se us par kya prabhaav pad rahaa he or saakshaatkaarkartta uske bare main kyasoch rahe ho? in sanketon dwaara aavedak ko prabalikaran miltaa he
 Each of his next behavior begins to be specified by this explanation
 kahn tathaa kennel ne saakshaatkaar ke abhipreranaatmak pahalu ko vishesh mahatva diya he
 He said that these conditions are necessary for the success of the interview- yadi saakshaatkaar ke dauraan ye sharten prashn nirmaan, vaastavik sanchaalan, ummidavaar ke maansik str, uski tatparta or bhaag lene kii ichha aadi vividh staron par puri ho jaati he to iske falswaroop diya gaya maapan or nirnay bhi bejod hoga
 a successful interviewer is also patient with the soft-spoken
 sari suchanaaen saakshaatkaarkartta se hokar hi guzarati he
 Therefore, it is the religion of the interviewer to collect work information, weigh the information signals, coordinate them properly and finally reach the decision about the selection of the applicant
 saakshaatkaar kii rachana vaartalap se hi hoti he
 Therefore, its success will also be determined by the negotiating skills of both sides
 kisi apratyaashit ghatana ke dwaara kabhi-kabhi saakshaatkaar ke dauraan sthapit anubandh bighad jaye to aisi sthiti main punah nae sire se santulan khojane kii sthiti aa jaati he
 Interviews have also come to have medical use in industries
 sabhi jagah sanrachit saakshaatkaar kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 At present, there has been a tremendous change in the principles and practice of interviewing
 symonds ne saakshaatkaar kii safalataa hetu chaar karkon ko mahatva diya he- The ultimate success of the method depends on the fact that if the employee protection, respect for the privacy of others and the information received are used properly, then the interview method can prove to be invaluable heritage for the study of industrial problems
 saakshaatkaar vidhiyon main trutiyon ke kaaran is pranali main puraa bharosa karnaa kathin he
 It is clear from the observation that considerable differences are seen by various interviewers in evaluating the candidates
 saakshaatkaar ek sarvaadhik aatmanishth vidhi he
 Since the evaluations do not have consistent conformance, this method cannot be considered reliable
 jo vidhi vishwasaneey nahin he, vah satya hone kaa daawa bhi nahin kar sakati he
 Scott, Halingworth and Vangar etc
 studied it
 sabhi ne is vidhi kii vishwasaneeyata par bharosa purna roopen nahin kiya he
 Some of the major interview errors are as follows - adhikansh saakshaatkaarkartta anjaane main vyarth kii baton ke prati purv sthapit anukulit pratikriyaaon se prabhavit hote hai
 Such as the candidate's voice, manner of speaking etc
 anukulit pratikriya main har vyakti apni pasandgi, naapsandgi vyakt karata he kintu vah is baat se avgat nahin rahata ki use kis prakaar vishisht vyavhaar ruchikar tathaa aruchikar prathit hote hai
 There is a belief of the person that the candidate will reveal his habit at the time of interview
 lekin manovaigyanik rup se iskaa koi thos aadhaar nahin he
 Therefore it is difficult to arrive at a decision as a result of a belief in a generalized habit
 saakshaatkaarkartta ko is prakaar kii aadaton se mukt rahane kii cheshtaa kerani chahie anyathaa iske nirnay doshapurn ho sakate hai tathaa saare chayan kaary par vipareet prabhaav pad saktaa he
 The interviewer tries to keep himself as free from bias as possible
 lekin har sambhav eemaandaaree ke baavjood kuch aisi achetan manovriti rakhata he jiske falswaroop vastuon, vyaktiyon tathaa ghatnaon ke prati uskaa pratyakshikaran or vyavhaar vishesh roopen prabhavit hotahai
 Therefore the interviewer cannot claim to be completely free from these prejudices
 saakshaatkaar ke samay aavedak purnatah unmukt na rahakar adhikansh bhaybheet dikhte hai
 It is also possible that a candidate is not able to put his / her qualifications and ideas in the right form before the board
 iske vipareet durbal aavedak baar-baar saakshaatkaar dene ke kaaran board ko prabhavit kar lete ho
 The success of the interview does not depend only on the merit and achievement of the candidate, but on the cleverness and skill to face such situations
 yogya vyakti bhi saakshaatkaar kii kala main praveen na hone par asafal rahata he
 Thus the interview system cannot be trusted completely
 isamen vyakti dusron ke vyavhaaron tathaa shishtacharon kaa anukaran karata he
 This tendency is seen again and again at the time of interview because the candidate inadvertently tries to establish his identity by imitating him due to the high position of the interviewer
 saakshaatkaarkartta ke mitrataa vyakt karne par aavedak main bhi aisi pratikriyaayein utpann hone lagati hai
 These exemplary tendencies are taken incorrectly
 faltah saakshaatkaar main iske nirnay bhi ayatharth hote hai
 Probably the biggest source of errors in interviews is not to explain the meaning of pointless glossaries
 saadharantah saakshaatkaarkarttaaon ko ummidavaaron ke shilgunon se sambandhit koi suchi nahin di jaati he
 Even if this list is given, they are rarely defined clearly
 swabhaavatah vyaktigat nirnay tathaa vyakhyaaon ke liye rasta adhik khul jaataa he, jiske kaaran ummidavaar ke chayan ke prashn par saakshaatkaarkartaaon main ghor matbhed ho jaataa he
 The probability of decision related inaccuracies increases
 lekin mahatvapurn baat yah he ki uparokt kathinaaiyon ke baavjood bhi saakshaatkaar kii lokapriyata kam nahin hoti he
 In this process of mutual face-to-face, many valuable secrets related to the personality and behavior of the candidate can also be inaugurated
 saakshaatkaar ek aisa madhyam he jiske dwaara ummidavaaron ko unke bhaavon tathaa vichaaron ko maukhik rup se abhivyakt karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 It is a useful system, but there are mainly two types of difficulties in declaring it as a useful selection system - in kathinaaiyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sudhaar sambandhi suzav nimna ho sakate hai- The efficiency of the interviewer is based on the success of the interview
 isliye aavashyak he ki saakshaatkaar samiti ke sadasyon kaa chayan saavdhaneepurvak karnaa chahie
 The interviewer must be qualified
 usamen pratyakshikaran kii tikshnata, parivartanshiltaa, samaayojanshiltaa tathaa vividh saakshaatkaar lene kaa anubhav hona chahie
 He should also get specialized training in interview art
 iske bina saakshaatkaarkartta saakshaatkaar ko safaltaapurvak sampann nahin kar saktaa he
 At the time of interview, they should be trained to adopt the same system and follow the same code of conduct
 bingham tathaa moore ne bhavi saakshaatkaarkartaaon ke prashikshan hetu nimna paraamarsh die hai- There should be an objective method for the measurement of transcendental properties
 iske liye pramanik moolyankan maandand kaa prayog apekshit he
 The more subdivisions shown in the criterion, the greater the veracity of the decision
 shilgunon kii suchi ko anubhav dwaara, karmchaaree prabandhakon dwaara va paryvekshakon dwaara yaa to agrim rup se taiyaar kar lenaa chahie athwa suchi kaa nirmaan kaary vishleshan paddati dwaara hona chahie
 The formulation of the questions should not be defective, which causes the candidate to have trouble understanding its meaning
 saakshaatkaar main saamaajikprashnon kaa poochna vaanchhneeya he jo icchit shilgunon se sambhddha hon
 Interviewers should be divided into different groups
 prayek ummidavaar ke samaksh ek samooh kam se kam ek baar avashya saakshaatkaar kare
 Decision inaccuracies can be reduced by this
 saath hi saakshaatkaar kii vishwasaneeyata bhi bad sakati he
 While useful, this suggestion is rarely used in practical terms
 kathinaayee is baat kii he ki saakshaatkaar main vaise hi samay adhik lagata he, jo or bad jaayegaa
 Interview is not just exchange of views
 saakshaatkaar main saakshatkaarthi ke bahya vyavhaaron ko bhi protsaahan milanaa chahie
 In this case, the interview works like behavioral or situational tests
 aadhunik manovaigyanikon ne apane anubhavon ke aadhaar par yah vichaar vyakt kiya he ki saakshaatkaar vidhi main vastunishth padon ko sammilit kiya ja saktaa he
 The method of assigning marks can also be adopted similar to this
 saakshaatkaar main prayukt padon ke pramanikaran hetu prayek ummidavaar se ek hi tarah ke prashn kiye jaayen to isse saakshaatkaar kaa uddeshy puraa nahin ho paata he
 Interview is a method of mutual dialogue in which new ideas and thoughts are generated in the conversation
 lekin baatcheet kii disha kii purna bhavishyavaanee karnaa kathin hota he
 To make the interview authentic, a standardized copy of the list should be given to the members of the committee so that it can be treated accordingly
 is suchi main vaanchit shilgunon kii suchi ko agrim banaakar ummidavaar se milane vaale gunon ko hi chihnit karte hai
 This is called the 'interview-employee evaluation form'
 gean naamak vidwaan ne saakshaatkaar ke liye nimna vyaavhaarik suzav die hai- If the right methods are adopted in the interview, then it can be made an important means of professional selection

 san 1895 main german vaigyanik haans goldshimat ne chromium or manganeez dhaatu banane ke praytn me ek mishran khoj nikaala, jiske dwaara anek dhaatuon ke oxidon kaa saralata se avkaran ho saktaa tha
 One such mixture is called thermite

 It was directed by Gulzar and is based on a story by Subodh Ghosh
 pramukh bhoomikaaon main rekha, nasiruddin shah or anuraadhaa patel hai
 The film tells the story of a couple who get separated and accidentally meet in the waiting room of a railway station and find some truth about life without each other
 yah film samanaantar cinema kii shrenee main aati he
 The film received two National Film Awards in the music category
 yah film mahendra ke saath railway stesan par utarane or pratiksha kaksh main jane ke saath shuru hoti he
 Sudha, a woman, is already sitting in the waiting room
 use dekhakar, vah usase chhipane kii koshish karti he lekin baad main ve ek-duusare se baatcheet karte hai
 It was learned that Mahendra does a successful photography business
 vah apane dada kaa sammaan karata he
 Incidentally, he had been engaged to Sudha for 5 years but always used to make excuses for delaying his marriage
 haalaanki, uske dada ne uski shaadi tay kar di
 He tells Sudha that he is in a relationship with a woman named Maya
 lekin maaya gaayab ho gai or uske paas kuch kavitaayen chhod gai
 Mahendra then marries Sudha and is quite happy, but Maya's sudden return creates tension in their married life
 jab maaya aatmahatya kaa prayaas karti he, to mahendra uske saath samay bitaana shuru kar detaa he
 Sudha does not know about Maya's suicide attempt and therefore believes that Mahendra is betraying her
 use aisa lagata he ki unki shaadi ek galati thi or mahendra se uske iraade ke bare main sawaal karti he
 He then firmly states that he is going to bring Maya home to talk to her
 sudhaa iske khilaaf he, lekin mahendra drudh sankalp ke saath chal detaa he
 However, Maya overhears Sudha's anger on the phone and by the time Mahendra reaches to pick her up, she is gone
 jab vah maaya ke bina ghar lautataa he, to use pataa chalata he ki sudhaa bhi chali gai he
 Mahendra is unable to bear the shock and has a heart attack
 aane vaale dinon or maheenon main, maaya dwaara uski dekhbhaal kii jaati he
 Sudha works as a teacher in Panchgani
 samay bitne ke baad, mahendra aashwast hona shuru hua ki use sudhaa ko ghar waapas laana chahie
 He then reads Sudha's letter that she is freeing him from their marriage and he is free to marry Maya
 mahendra ke achaanak chillaahat se maaya ne mahasoos kiya ki vah sudhaa ke prasthaan kaa kaaran thim or mahendra sudhaa ko gaharaai se yaad karata he
 Maya feels inconsistent at this sudden change in their relationship and, at night, leaves by motorbike
 mahendra use rokane ke liye apni car main uskaa peechha karne jaataa he
 Maya's scarf gets entangled in the back wheel of her bike, causing her neck to die
 yah samaran samaapt hone ke baad, sudhaa maaya ke ant ke bare main sunakar gaharaai se dukhi he
 Later when the time for their train arrives, Sudha's husband arrives unexpectedly to pick her up and Mahendra is shocked to learn about Sudha's remarriage
 jaisaa hi sudhaa kaa pati apane saamaan ke saath pratiksha kaksh chodta he, mahendra ne sudhaa se use maaf karne ke liye kaha
 She touches Mahendra's feet as a plea for his forgiveness and permission to leave him
 aisa, jo usne unke pichhali baar alag hone par nahin kiya tha
 Mahendra blesses her for a happy life
 sudhaa ke pati yah dekhne ke liye lautataa he ki vah kaise rukii hui he or phir sudhaa ke thake hue chehre ko dekhte hue yah mahasoos karata he ki yah aadmi uskaa purv pati hona chahie
 Sudha and her husband go ahead and Sudha stops a bit with remorse
 jaise ki vahaan se janaa nahin chaahati, jabaki mahendra pratiksha kaksh ke baahar laachaar khadey hokar use dur jate hue dekhtaa he
 The music of the film was highly appreciated and is believed to play an important role in telling the story of the film

 Only the wicket-keeper is allowed to wear guards and gloves on his feet among the fielding squad members
 mukhya rup se yah ek visheshgy kii bhoomika he, haalaanki kabhi-kabhi use gendbaaji ke liye bhi kaha jaataa he, aisi sthiti main kshetrarakshan dal ke kisi anya sadsy ko kuch samay ke liye wicket keeper kii bhoomika nibhaani padati he
 The role of the keeper in the rules of cricket is governed by Rule 40
 keeper kaa pramukh kaam un gendon ko pakadana hota he, jo ballebaajon ke paas se guzar kar wicket ke peeche chali aati hai, lekin vah vibhinn tareekon se ballebaaj ko out karne kii bhi koshish kar saktaa he: The position of a keeper depends on the bowler: when fast bowling, he stands slightly away from the stumps, so that he has time to catch the ball coming off the edge of the bat, while in slow bowling he stumps
 k gets very close, so that the pressure is on the batsman to stay inside the crease or risk getting stumped out
 keeper jitna zyada sakasham hoga, utani hi tej gendbaaji ko lapakane main vah kaamyaab rahegaa, udhaaharan ke liye aapako bataa den ki godfre ivance aksar alek bedsar ke liye wicket keeping karte the
 Wicket-keeping is a specialist job and requires the same type of training as expected from an expert batsman or bowler
 haalaanki aaj ke samay main ek wicket-keeper se ummid kii jaati he ki vah ek acha ballebaaj bhi ho jo kam se kam madhyakram main ballebaaji kar sake
 Wicket-keepers who are proficient in batting in the above order are also informally called keeper / batsman
 cricket ke kisi ek dal main sirf ek hi keeper kii jagah hoti he, aise main chayankartaaon ko aksar do yaa usase adhik daksh kiparon main se kisi ek ko chunane kii chunauti kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 It is often the case that one of the two keepers is a very good keeper, but he is just an average batsman, while the other is a keeper / batsman who is better at batting but is not as good a keeper than his opponent
 1990 ke dashak main england ke chayankartaaon ke saamne ek aisi hi chayan duvidha saamne ai thi, jab unhen jaik rasel or alek stewart ke bich kisi ek ko chunane kii chunauti mili
 He was never successful in consistently choosing either of these until Russell began to languish in 1998: both roles were switched up before that, with good batting often making Stewart his place in the team Used to be successful
 isi tarah pakistani wicket keeper kamran akmal bhi ek or udhaaharan he jo ek aise wicket keeper ke taur par janaa jaataa he jo aasaan maukon ko ganvaata he, lekin vah pichley ek dashak se team main apni jagah banaae hue hai, kyonki unki ballebaaji vaikalpik keeper se acchhee he
 Today in cricket Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Kumar Sangakkara, Brandon mccullum and Mark Boucher are the best keeper / batsman
 keeper kii captaini kii bhoomika bhi ho sakati he
 The special thing is that he is involved in every ball of an innings and may not be as captain as he is in a position to watch things closely
 unhen aksar gendbaajon ko utsahit karte hue dekha ja saktaa he or vah ballebaajon ko unki kshamta, vyaktitv or nijee aadaton par sateek tippaniyon se "apshabd" kehane main bhi lipt main hota he
 The keeper is the only fielder allowed to catch the ball with a defensive device, which is usually a large padded knob with a mesh between the index finger and thumb
 dastaane se jo suraksha milti he vah hameshaa paryaapt nahin hoti he
 England keeper Alan Knott sometimes padded his gloves inside for extra protection
 wicket-keeper pairon kii suraksha ke liye leg pads or qamar ke neeche vaale hisse kii raksha ke liye box kaa istemaal karte hai
 Wicket-keepers are given the opportunity to take off their pads and bowl, and this often happens when a match is progressing on par or the fielding team is desperate to take a wicket
 pratham shrenee cricket main do wicket-kiparon ne apana pad utaara or phir hetric lee he: 1954-55 main katak main khele gaye urisa banaam bengal ke match main probir sen or asi smith ne 1965 main clacton main varavikshire banaam asex ke match main; smith ek behad hi asaamaanya khilaadi the, kyonki wo mukhya taur par ek wicket-keeper the, lekin kabhi-kabhi unka chayan mukhya gendbaaj ke rup main bhi hota tha
 According to Rule 2 of the rules of cricket, a substitute player cannot keep wicket
 ballebaaji dal ke captain kii sahmati se kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko radd bhi kiya ja saktaa he, haalaanki niyam 2 main is tarah kii kisi sahmati kii ijaajat nahin detaa he
 For example, during the first innings of the Test match between England and New Zealand being played at Lord's in 1986, England's specialist wicket-keeper Bruce French was injured
 tab england ne newjiland kii pehali pari main chaar khilaadiyon ko wicket-keeper ke taur par istemaal kiya: bill athe ne pehle do overon ke liye keeping kii; 45 saal ke varisht khilaadi bob tailor ko praayojakon ke tent se bulaakar keeping karai gayi or unhone 3 se 76 overon tak bina galati ke badhiya keeping kii; 77 se 140 overon tak ke liye hampshire ke keeper bobi parks ko bulaayaa gaya; or phir bruce french ne pari kii aakhri gend tak wicket keeping kii

 kumbhandas ashtchhaap ke prasiddh kavi the
 He was a contemporary of Paramanand Das ji
 kumbhandas kaa charit "churaasi vaishnavan kii vaarta" ke anusaar sankalit kiya jaataa he
 Kumbhandas lived in a village called "jamunavatau", some distance away from Mount Govardhan in Braj
 unke ghar main kheti-baadi hoti thi
 From his village, he used to go to Parsoli Chandrasarovar to do kirtan in Srinathji's temple
 unka janm gaurava kshatriya kul main hua tha
 Kumbhandas had seven sons, except Chaturbhajadas who were engaged in all agricultural activities
 unhone 1492 i0 main mahaprabhu vallabhacharya se diksha lee thi
 He was completely disgusted and far from wanting money, honor, dignity
 ek baar akbar badshaah ke bulaane par inhen fatehpur sikri janaa padaa jahaan inkaa bada sammaan hua
 But he was equally sorry for this, as expressed by his post- anumaanath: kumbhandas ji kaa janm govardhan,mathura ke sannikat jamunaavato naamak gram main samvath 1525 vikrami main caitra krishna ekadshi ko hua tha
 He was a Gorwa Kshatriya
 unke pita ek saadhaaran shrenee ke vyakti the
 He used to do farming and make a living
 kumbhandas ne bhi paitruk vritti main hi aasthaa rakhi or kisaani kaa jivan hi unhen acha laga
 Parsoli was particularly cultivated
 unhen paise kaa abhaav aaajeevan khatkata rahaa par unhone kisi ke saamne haath nahin pasaara
 Bhagavadhakti was his property
 unka kutumb bahut bada tha, kheti kii aay se uskaa paalan karte the
 In addition to his wife in the family, he had seven sons, seven sons-in-law and a widow's niece
 kumbhandas param bhagavadbhakt, adarsh grihasth or mahaan virakt the
 He was a disinterested, renunciate and great conspirator
 nake charitra kii vishisht, aloukikta yah thi ki bhagwaan saakshaat prakat hokar unke saath sakha bhav kii kridaayen karte the
 Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya Ji was his deeksha-guru
 samvath 1550 vikrami main acharya kii govardhan yatra ke samay unhone brahmasambandh liya tha
 Fifteen years before his initiation period, the idol of Shrinath ji had appeared, he started serving Shrinath ji with the permission of Acharya
 'pushtimaarg' main dikshit tathaa shrinath ji ke mandir main kirtankaar ke pad par niyukt hone par bhi unhone apni vritti nahin chodi or ant tak nirdhanavastha main apane parivaar kaa bharan-poshan karte rahe
 In the temple of Srinath ji, Kumbhandas started singing new verses regularly
 'pushti sampradaay' main sammilit hone par unhen kirthan kii hi seva di gayi thi
 Kumbhandas considered Bhagavatkripa to be paramount, even in the biggest domestic crisis, he never deviated from his path of faith
 shrinath ji ke shringaar sambandhi padon kii rachana main unki vishesh abhiruchi thi
 Once Vallabhacharya ji was pleased with his couple's post regarding Leela and said - "'you have felt the juice of Nikunj Leela
 " kumbhandas mahaprabhu kii krupa se gadgad hokar bol uthe ki- "mujhe to isi ras kii nitant aavashyaktaa he
 " mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ke lila-pravesh ke baad kumbhandas gosai vittalanath ke sangrakshan main rahakar bhagwaan kaa lila-gaan karne lage
 Vitthalnath Maharaj had great kindness on him
 ve man-hi-man unke nirlobh jivan kii saraahna kiya rate the
 He was counted among the 'poets of Ashtachhap' in Samvat 1602 Vikrami
 bade-bade raja-maharaja aadi kumbhandas kaa darshan karne main apana saubhaahgya maanate the
 The great rasikas and saint mahatmas of Vrindavan used to wish their satsang excellently
 unhone bhagavadbhakti kaa yash sadaa akshunn rakhaa, aarthik sankat or deenta se use kabhi kalankit nahin hone diya
 Once Srivitthalnath wanted to take him along on his journey to Dwarka, he thought that his financial condition would be improved by the offering of Vaishnavas
 kumbhandas shrinath ji kaa viyog ek pal ke liye bhi nahin sah sakate the, par unhone gosai ji kii ajna kaa virodh nahin kiya
 He had gone to the Apsara Kunda with Gosainji to remember that the beauty of Shrinath ji rose from his limbs, the joy of the sweet sweet smile of God rose in the darkness, his heart was hurt by the pain of Madhuryasamrat Nandanandan Are you done? unhone shrinath ji ke viyog main ek pad gaaya- This rare song had a big impact on Srigosai Ji's heart
 ve nahin chaahate the kumbhandas pal bhar ke liye bhi shrinath ji se alag rahen
 He returned to Kumbhandas
 shrinath jika darshan karke kumbhandas swasth hue
 Once, in the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar, a singer sang the post of Kumbhandas
 badshaah ne us pad se aakrisht hokar kumbhandas ko fatehpur sikri bulaayaa
 At first, Kumbhandas did not want to go, but seeing the special request of soldiers and messengers, he went on foot
 shrinath ji ke sabha sadsy ko akbar kaa aishwarya do kaudi kaa laga
 Kumbhandas's turban was torn, his body was dirty, he was drowning in self-guilt as to which sins he had to appear in front of
 badshaah ne unki badi aavbhagat kii, par kumbhandas ko to aisa laga ki kisi ne unako narak main laakar khadaa kar diya he
 They started thinking that there is a better Braj than Raj Sabha, in which Srinathji himself keeps playing, doing many sports
 akbar ne pad gane kii prarthana kii
 Kumbhandas was a poet of Lord Krishna's majesty, he performed the song - badshaah sahruday the, unhone adarpurvak unako ghar bhej diya
 Maharaja Mansingh visited Braj in Samvat 1620 Vikrami
 unhone vrindavan ke darshan ke baad govardhan kii yatra kii
 Visited Shrinathji
 us samay mrudang or veena ke saath kumbhandas ji kirthan kar rahe the
 Raja Mansingh was greatly influenced by his style of singing
 ve unase milane jamunaavato gayi
 He was amazed to see Kumbhandas's poor condition
 kumbhandas bhagwaan ke rup-chintan main dhyansth the
 On opening his eyes, he asked his niece for posture and mirror, he got the answer that 'the posture was eaten, the mirror was drunk
 ' aashay yah tha ki pani main mukh dekhakar ve tilak karte the
 Maharaja Mansingh came to know of his poverty
 unhone sone kaa darpan dena chaha, bhagwaan ke bhakt ne asweekaar kar diya, moharon kii thili deni chaahi, vishwapati ke sevak ne uski upeksha kar di
 While walking, Mansingh wanted to name the village of Jambuwato Kumbhandas, but he said that "my work is done only by the curry tree and the plum tree
" " raja maansingh ne unki ni:sprihata or tyaag kii saraahna kii, unhone kaha ki "maaya ke bhakt to maine bahut dekhe hai, par vaastavik bhagavadbhakt to aap hi hai
 " vriddhavastha main bhi kumbhandas nity jamunaavato se shrinath ji ke darshan ke liye govardhan aayaa karte the
 One day he stopped near Anodar on the connecting rod
 'ashtchhaap' ke prasiddh kavi chaturbhujadas ji, unke chote putr saath the
 He told Chaturbhuj Das that "now what to do by walking home
" kuch samay baad sharir hi chhootane vaala he
