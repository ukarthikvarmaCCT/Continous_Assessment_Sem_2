 Everything was going well, but when Bhat's daughter got married, Bhat's wife started worrying about his marriage
 usne apane pati se kaha ki vah pushtaini peshey se jo kamakar laata he usase dainik kharch to aaraam se chal jaataa he, magar beti ke vivaah ke liye kuch bhi nahin batch paata he
 Marriage of a daughter costs a lot, so she will have to make some other efforts
 bhaat yah sunakar hans padaa or kehane laga ki beti use bhagwaan kii ichha se praapt hui he, isliye uske vivaah ke liye bhagwaan koi rasta nikaal hi denge
 If this was not the case, every couple would get only a son or no couple would remain childless
 sab ishwar kii ichha se hi hota he
 Days passed, but Bhat could not get enough money to spend on his daughter's marriage
 uski patni ab dukhi rahane lagi
 If his grief was not seen, he went out of his intention to collect money one day
 kai rajyon kaa bhraman kar usne saikadon rajdhikariyon tathaa bade-bade sethon ko hansaakar unka manoranjan kiya tathaa unki prashansa main geet gaae
 Pleased with the prizes given by those people, the daughter's money became worth marriage
 jab vah sara dhan lekar laut rahaa tha to raste main na jane choron ko kaise uske dhan kii bhanak lag gai
 They looted all the money
 ab to bhaat kaa vishwaas bhagwaan par or chahenge uske paas beti ke byaah ke liye dhan nahin hoga
 When he returned home, his wife hoped that he would have brought appropriate money for marriage
 bhaat kii patni ko bataaya ki uske baar-baar kehane par vah vivaah ke liye dhan arjeet karne ko kai pradesh gaya or tarah-tarah ko logon se mila
 He also collected enough money from the people, but God did not approve of his daughter's marriage with that money
 raste main sara dhan luteron ne lut liya or kisi tarah praan bachaakar vah waapas laut aayaa he
 Bhat's wife drowned in deep anxiety
 usne pati se poocha ki ab beti kaa byaah kaise hoga
 Bhat again reiterated that the God who has given the daughter will also arrange for her marriage
 is par uski patni niraashaa bhari khiz ke saath boli ki ishwar lagata he maharaja vikram ko vivaah kii vyavastha karne bhejenge
 While this conversation was taking place, Maharaj was passing by his house
 unhen bhaat kii patni kii tippanee par hansee aa gai
 On the other hand, the Brahmin was pursuing a hereditary profession for his livelihood
 vah puja-paath karwaakar jo kuch bhi dakshina ke rup main praapt karata usee se anandpurvak nirvaah kar rahaa tha
 Brahmani too saw everything normal until his daughter became marriageable
 beti ke vivaah kii chintaa jab sataane lagi to usne brahman ko kuch dhan jamaa karne ko kaha
 But the Brahmin could not do even after wishing
 patni ke baar-baar yaad dilaane par usne apane yajmaanon ko ghuma phiraa kar kaha bhi, magar kisi yajmaan ne uski baat ko gambhirthapurvak nahin liya
 One day the brahmini got fed up and said that marriage expenses should be sought by Maharaja Vikramaditya, because there is no other option
 kanyadan to karnaa hi he
 The Brahmin said that he would definitely go to Maharaj
 maharaj dhan daan karenge to sari vyavastha ho jaaegi
 Vikram overheard his entire conversation with his wife too, as they were passing by her house at the same time
 subah main unhone sipaahiyon ko bheja or bhaat tathaa brahman donon ko darbar main bulawaaya
 Vikramaditya donated one million gold currencies to Bhat with his own hands
 phir brahman ko rajkosh se kuch sau mudraayen dilava di
 Both of them were very happy and left from there
 jab ve chale gaye to ek darbari ne maharaj se kuch kehane kii anumati maangi
 He inquired as to why both the Bhat and the Brahmin wanted money for the girl's charity, then why did the Maharaja curry favor
 bhaat ko das lakh or brahman ko sirf kuch sau swarna mudraayen kyon di
 Vikram replied that Bhat was not sitting on his backyard for money
 vah ishwar se aas lagaaye baitha tha
 God can give anything to people, so they gave him unexpected donations as a representative of God, whereas the Brahmin, despite being of noble lineage, did not have full faith in God
 vah unase sahaayta kii apeksha rakhata tha
 The king is also a human, cannot replace God

 The Lord of the Rings, written by Tolkien is based on the book

 Set in the fictional world of Middle Earth, these three films revolve around the Hobbit Frodo Buggins in which he and the fellowship seek to destroy a ring and ensure the destruction of its creator, Dark Lord Sauron
 lekin faillowship vibhajit ho jaataa he or frodo apane vafaadaar saathi sam or vishwasghaatee gollum ke saath khoj jari rakhata he
 Meanwhile, the deported magicians Gandalf and Aragorn, who are the true heirs to the throne of Gondor, unite the freedmen of Middle Earth and are ultimately victorious in the Ring of War

 Released in 2011 and 2012, The Hobbit is a film adaptation being produced in two parts, with Jackson collaborating with Guillermo del Toro
 nirdeshak peter jackson pehali baar da lord of da rings ke sampark main aae jab unhone 1978 main ralf bakshi kii film dekhi thi
 Jackson "liked it and wanted to know more about it
" Later, he read the tie-in version of that book during a twelve-hour train journey from Wellington to Auckland

 When Universal canceled King Kong in 1997, Jackson and Walsh immediately had the support of Winsteen, and a six-week process for sorting rights began
 Jackson and Walsh asked Costa Boates to summarize the book and they re-read the book
 do se teen maheene ke baad unhone apane sanskaran ko likhaa

 He agreed to two films on a total budget of $ 750 million
 1997 ke madhya ke dauraan jackson or walsh stephen ne sinclayr ke saath likhnaa shuru kiya
 Sinclair's partner Philip Boynes was a big fan of the book and joined his writing team after reading his narration
 do filmon kii patakatha ko likhane main 13-14 maheene lag gaye, jo kramshah 147 or 144 pannon ke the
 Sinclair had to abandon the project due to theatrical obligations
 In their revision, Sam is forced to go with Frodo as he eavesdrops on the others, and instead of Sam, Mary and Pippin find out about the ring and voluntarily leave him after he encounters Frodo
 And this form is found in the original novel
 gandalf ke orthank main bitaye gaye samay ko flashbek se baahar nikaal liya gaya or lothalorian ko kaat liya gaya or saath hi gladrial vahi karti he jo vah kahani main revandale main karti he

 After spending four months there, he told Miramax that these films cost around $ 150 million and are unable to finance with Miramax and due to the $ 150 million already spent, he merged the two films into one Decided to do
 17 june 1998 ko bob venstin ne pustak rupantaran ko do ghante ke filmi prayog ko prastut kiya
 He suggests removing the war of Bree and Hemsdeep, "keeping or removing" Saruman, replacing Rohan and Gondor as Iovine as Boromir's sister, shortening Rivendell and Moria, as well as Mary by Uruk High And stopping Pippin's kidnapping by the ants
 While Jackson objected to the idea of "cutting half of the good stuff", Miramax announced that any script or work done by the Veta workshop belonged to him
 mark ordeski ke saath new line cinema ke meeting se pehle apane kaam ke pantis minute ke video ko dikhaane ke liye jackson lagbhag chaar saptaah ke liye hollywood gaye the
 Robert Shye on New Line Cinema saw the video and asked why they were making two films while the book was published as three editions, they wanted to make the film Triology
 jiske kaaran jackson, walsh or boyens ko ab teen nae patakatha likhane the
 The three films had more creative freedom to expand, but Walsh, Jackson and Boynes had to restructure them according to their script
 teen filmein triology ke teen sanskarnon ke bilkul anuroop to nahin he, lekin teenon hisse ke rupantaran kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 Jackson, however, adopted a more chronological approach to the story than Tolkien
 Frodo's quest is his main goal and Aragorn is the main subplot, and many of its sequences omit many scenes that do not directly contribute to those two plotlines
 santoshjanak or sunishchit nishkarsh banane ke liye bahut prayaas kiya gaya tha or sunishchit kiya gaya ki pratipaadan unki gati ko dhimi naa kar de
 nae drishyon ke bich, vahaan tatwon kaa bhi vistaar kiya gaya he jo tolkin ko sandigdh karti he jaise yuddh or jeev ke rup main
 Most of the characters were tweaked for additional drama: elements of self-doubt were added or changed in Aragorn, Theoden, and Treebird, while Galadriel, Elrond, and Faramir's Charine were cast
 boromir or gollam ko apekshaakrit adhik dayaalu jabaki ligolas, gimli, saruman or denothor ko sarlikrut ke rup main kiya gaya
 Some characters, such as Arwen and Yomar, are combined with minor characters from the book such as Glorfindel and Erkenbrand, and as a typical case the lines of dialogue are sometimes changed between locations or characters depending on the suitability of the scenes
 charitra-chithran ke vistaar ke liye nae drishyon ko bhi joda gaya
 During the filming, the screenplays continued to develop partly due to the contribution of the actors who wanted to make their characters more rusty
 in punarlekhnon main sabase adhik ullekhneey charitra arven, kaa tha jise mul rup se ek yoddha rajkumaari ke rup main yojana banaai gai thi, lekin pustak main dekhen to uskaa rup prayavartit he or jo kahani main shaareerik rup se niskriy he 
 The most comprehensive study of filmmaking is The Frodo franchise, created by film historian Kristin Thomson
 is triology main yuddh or talwaar kii koreography ko viksit karne ke liye film nirmaataaon ne hollywood ke manyata praapt talwaar guru bob anderson ko niyukt kiya
 Anderson teamed up with the talented Wiggo Mortensen and Karl Urban to develop several sword battles and stunts in the film
 da lord of da rings triology main bob anderson ne jo bhoomika adaa kii he unki us vishistataa ko film richleming da blade main dikhaaya gaya he
 The documentary, based on the sword martial arts, features Veta Workshop and Richard Taylor, The Lord of the Rings painter John Howe, and actors Viggo Mortensen and Carl Urban

 In August 1997, Jackson began the narrative design of this trology with Christian Rivers and assigned his crew to begin the design of Middle Earth
 Jackson assigned his old colleague Richard Taylor the leadership of five key design elements: armor, weapons, prosthetic / makeup, creatures, and miniatures at the Veta workshop
 In November 1997, renowned Tolkien lecturers Alan Lee and John Howe joined the project
 Most of the images in the films are based on his various paintings
 production diziner grant major ko lee or hove ke dizin ko sthapaty kala main parivartit karne kii jimmevary saunpi gai thi, vihlst den henah ne kala nirdesan, sthanon kaa pataa lagaana or set ke nirmaan kaa aayojan ke rup main kaam kiya
 Jackson's imagery of Middle-earth is described by Randy Cook as Ray Herrihausen's meeting with David Lean
 jackson kalpana ke liye ek drudh yatharth or aitihaasik lihaaj chaahate the or us duniya ko tarksangat or vishwasaneey banane kaa unhone bharsak prayaas kiya
 For example, the New Zealand Army had helped make the hobiton a few months before the film was made so that xxx was biologically designed to appear to be a reliable creature, such as heavy feathers to help fallen animals fly

 He also added 1,800 hobbits of legs for leading actors such as several prosthetics, as well as many ears, noses and heads for the characters and more than 19,000 dresses were woven

 saat bhinn-bhinn shooting ikaayiyon ke saath is triology kii shooting 150 se bhi zyada sthanon main kii gai thi, saath hi saath wellington or queenstown ke aasapaas soundstages bhi lagaae gaye the
 Jackson directed all of the productions, in addition to directors of other units included John Mahaffey, Geoff Murphy, Fran Walsh, Barri Osbaurne, Rick Porrus and a few other assistant directors, producers, or writers
 jackson sajiv upgrah feed ke madhyam se in ikaayiyon kii nigaraanee karte the saath hi unhen script kaa lagaataar punarlekhan karnaa hota tha jiske kaaran unke upar atirikt dabaav ban gaya tha jiske chalate unhen kareeb chaar ghante hi sone ke liye milte the, iske alaava anek ikaayiyon unke is kalpana kaa vyakhya bhi karti thi
 The helicopters were sometimes unable to locate the area due to some locations being too remote and the film crew could not leave the house on time, so the crew kept survival kits with them

 Filming of battle scenes in Tongariro National Park had a significant impact on the park, which later made it necessary to repair the park

 This was the final area to shape the film, when Jackson realized that sometimes the best screenplay might be unnecessary on screen, as he criticized the daily scenes from various takes

 The major Hindi newspapers of India are: - vibhinn fasalon ko kisi nishchit kshetra par, ek nishchit kram se, kisi nishchit samay main bone ko sasy aavartan ) kehete hai

 The same tradition of crop production is called the crop cycle, ie, the cycle of interchangeable crops with the purpose of maintaining the fertility of the land for a certain period over a certain area is called the crop cycle

 Santa Claus is known as St
 Nicholas, Father Christmas, Chris Kringle, or just "santa"
 puranic or aitihaasik drushti se ve lok kathaon main prachlit ek vyakti hai
 In many Western cultures, it is believed that Santa arrives at good children's homes and presents them during Christmas Eve, that is, on the evening of 24 December or late at night
 santa kii aadhunik akruti kii vyutpatti sinterclas kii dach akruti se hui, jise sambhavatya uphaar dene vaale saint nicholas se sambandhit mana jaataa he
 St
 Nicholas is a historical figure which is found in hagiographical stories

 1 janvari ko greece main besil kaa fist diwas manaaya jaataa he, is din tohfon kaa aadan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Santa Claus is usually depicted as a fat, cheerful white-bearded man who wears a red coat with a white collar and cuffs, along with a leather black belt and boots
 The image became popular in the United States and Canada in the 19th century
 is chhavi ko lokapriy banane main tatkaaleen raajnneetik cartoonist thomas nast ne mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 gaanon, radio, television, bacchon kii kitabon or filmon ke madhyam se is chhavi ko banaaye rakhaa gaya he
 In the United Nations and Europe, they are often depicted as American Santa Claus, but they are often called Father Christmas
 santa close se judy ek prasidd lokkatha ke anusaar vah uttar main kisi dur kshetra main ek barfile desh main rahata he
 According to the American version of Santa Claus, he lives in his home in the North Pole, while Father Christmas is often said to live in the mountains of Korvatunturi in Lopland Province, Finland
 santa close apni patni shrimati close ke saath rahata he
 He is accompanied by an unspecified but large number of elves and at least eight or nine flying reindeers
 ek or lokkatha jo geet "santa close is kaming tu toun" main prachlit he, ke anusaar vah puri duniya ke bacchon kii ek suchi banaata he, unhen unke vyavhaar ke anusaar alag alag shreniyon main rakhata he or christmas kii purv sandhya vaali raat, duniya ke sabhi achche ladakon or ladakiyon ko khilone, kendi or anya uphaar detaa he or kabhi kabhi shararti bacchon ko koyala detaa he
 For this, he enlists the help of one of his dwarves who makes toys for him in the workshop, and Reindeer pulls out his car

 He was a fourth-century Greek Christian bishop of Myra in Lysia, a province in Byzantine Anatolia
 yah praant ab turki main he
 Nicholas was famous for gifting poor people with a generous heart, especially given dowry for the three daughters of a pious Christian to prevent them from becoming prostitutes
 He was of a very religious nature from an early age and devoted his entire life to Christianity
 In Europe, he is still represented as a bearded bishop in the dress of Christianity
 1087 main, baari kaa italvi shahar, tatkaaleen laabhadaayak tirthayatra udyog shuru karnaa chahta tha
 The city began a campaign to build the grave of this Christian saint and establish his remains
 saint nicholas kii samadhi ko unke avasheshon sahit italvi navikon ke dwaara lut liya gaya, ise apavitra bana diya gaya, in avasheshon ko baari main laayaa gaya jahaan inhen aaj tak rakhaa gaya he
 To store this loot, a basilica was built this year and the area became a pilgrimage center for the devotees, thus the campaign proved to be economically justified
 irish itihaaskaar kehete hai ki unke avasheshon ko phir se italy se laakar county kilkeni main jerpoint ebbe main laayaa gaya, jahaan unki kabr ko aaj bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Later diverse groups ranging from archers, sailors and children to moneylenders claimed that St
 Nicholas was a patron saint
 ve amsterdam or masco donon ke bhi sangrakshak sant hai
 There are many similarities between Santa Claus and Odin
 odin isai dharm se pehle germany ke logon ke ek pramukh devtaa the
 Since many of these elements are not related to Christianity, there are some theories that relate to the pagan origins of the traditions in the regions where the people of Germany were converted to Christianity and their original traditions persisted in them, the same illustration Santa Clauses is seen in various forms of modern description
 odin ko kabhi kabhi ul ke germany ke deshi avkaash main, aasmaan main ek mahaan shikaar dal ke rup main darj kiya jaataa tha
 Two books from Iceland, Poetic Edda which were compiled from early sources in the 13th century and Pros Edda, written by Snorri Starluson in the 13th century, describe Odin
 inamen odin sleepnir naamak ek aath taagon vaale ghode par savaar he, jo kaaphi lambi duuri tak chalaang laga saktaa he, isaki tulana santa close ke rendier se kii ja sakati he
 In addition, Odin is addressed by several names in Scaldic poems, some of which detail his form and works
 in main siograni, sioscagar, langbaror, or jolnir shaamil hai
 According to some traditions, children fill carrots, straw, or sugar in their boots and place them near the chimney to eat Odin's flying horse, Sleipnir
 odin un bacchon ko unki dayalutaa kaa inaam dene ke liye sleepnir ke bhojan kii jagah bacchon ke liye uphaar or kendi aadi rakh detaa he
 This practice persisted after the adoption of Christianity in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, and as a result of the coming of Christianity, it became related to Saint Nicholas
 is pratha ko aaj bhi kai gharon main chimney par moja latakaae jane kii aadhunik pratha main dekha ja saktaa he
 Originating from pre-christian Alpine traditions and later influenced by the arrival of Christianity, Krampus is represented as a companion of St
 Nicholas
 paramparaagat rup se, kuch yuvak disambar ke pehle do saptahon main, vishesh rup se 5 disambar kii shaam ko crampus kii poshaak pahante hai or galiyon main gum kar bacchon ko jang lagi chen or ghantiyon se daraate hai
 Assistants in the Netherlands and Belgium help St
 Nicholas

 In many countries, their feast is celebrated by giving gifts on 6 December
 haalanki, netherland main dach 5 disambar kii shaam ko utsav maanate hai, ise "pakajesaond" kaha jaataa he
 During the sixteenth – seventeenth century Renaissance in Europe, many Protestants and many others replaced the gift-giver
 Now gifts were brought by a Christian child or Christkind
 The date of receiving the gift was also changed
 ab uphaar 6 disambar kii jagah christmas kii purv sandhya par laaye jane lage
 The folklore of St
 Nicholas is also in vogue with several German mythologies, most notably those of the god Odin
 inamen ek dadhi vaala sevak, topi pahane hue bhaalaa lekar chalata he
 He also has a bag of clothes to hold mischievous children
 saint nicholas or odin donon safed ghodon par savaar hai, ye ghode hawa main ud sakate hai; odin kaa safed aath taangon vaala safed ghoda he, jiskaa naam sleepnir he 
 jwarte piton ke dwaara bacchon ko di gayi kendi se bane patr odin ke run patron kii khoj ko prerit karte hai
 The poems performed during the festival and the songs performed by the children demonstrate that Odin is the god of poetry
 netherland or belgium ke santa close ke paatr ko, jaisaa ki sanyukt rajya america main janaa jaataa he dach main de karstman or french main pere naal kaha jaataa he
 He is different from Sinterklaas, although they both wear red dresses and they both have white beards
 haalanki netherlands main disambar main bacchon ko mukhya rup se sinterclas uphaar detaa he, dach jansankhya kaa paanchvaan hissaa christmas par uphaar detaa he
 
 26 percent of Dutch people give gifts on both days
 belgium main, uphaar keval bacchon ko die jate hai, lekin inamen se lagbhag sabhi uphaar sinterclas diwas par hi die jate hai
 On Christmas Day, everyone gets presents, but often these gifts come without the help of Santa Claus
 lekin unhone apana bishap kaa paridhaan kho diya, unhen pehali baar ek mote pet vaale dach navik ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya, jisane hare rang kaa ek sardiyon kaa kot pahana he or pipe lee hui he

 1821 main, neuyork main paanch se baarah varsh kii umr ke bacchon ke liye ek pustak a new year'sa pregent kaa prakaashan kiya gaya
 It contains a poem Old Santeclause, which details an old man who brings gifts for children on a carriage of reindeer
 kavita "a vizit from saint nicholas" ke prakaashan ke baad, santa close ke bare main aadhunik canan avadharana ban gayi
 On 23 December 1823, Clement Clarke Moore was described in a poem called Sentinel in Troy, New York
 unke kai aadhunik roopon ko is kavita main bataaya gaya he, jaise ek gaadi par savaar hona, ek chimney se hokar pravesh karnaa, ek khilaunon se bharaa bag laana
 saint nik ko "ek galphule or mote, ek hansmukh buudhe vyakti ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he, jiskaa "ek chota gol pet" he, "jab vah hansata he to hill jaataa he", iske bajaay "choti gaadi" or "chota rangifer" ab bhi yah ingit karte hai ki vah shaareerik rup se kamazor he
 The reindeer are also given many names like Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Komat, Cupid, Dundar and Blixem
 
 As time went on, Santa Claus developed into a large, heavy man in popular culture

 In 1863, a picture of Santa made by Nast was published in Harper's Weekly

 Emergency management is the generic name for an interdisciplinary field that deals with the strategic organizational management processes used to protect an organization's critical assets from hazardous risks posing a disaster or disaster and to ensure their continuity over a planned lifetime
 aastiyaan sajiv, nirjeev, saanskrithik yaa aarthik ke rup main vargeekrut hai
 Hazards are classified by natural or man-made causes
 prakriyaaon kii pahchaan ke uddeshy se sampurna samrik prabandhan kii prakriya ko chaar kshetron main baanta gaya he
 These four areas are generally concerned with risk mitigation, preparing resources to counter the threat, responding to the actual damage caused by the hazard, and limiting further damage and returning to the situation as closely as possible to the event of the threat 
 kshetra saarvajanik or nijee donon main hota he, prakriya ek si sanjhi hoti he lekin dhyaan centre vibhinn hote hai
 The emergency management process is a strategic process rather than a policy process, so it is usually limited to the executive level in the organization
 saamaanya rup se isaki koi pratyaksh shakti nahin he lekin yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki ek sanghathan ke sabhi bhaag ek saanjhe lakshya par dhyaan kendrit karen, yah salaahkaar ke rup main yaa kaaryon ke samanvay ke liye kaary karata he
 Effective emergency management depends on the overall integration of emergency plans at all levels of the organization and the understanding that the lowest levels of the organization are responsible for managing emergencies and receiving additional resources and support from the upper levels
 kaarykram kaa sanchaalan karne vaale sanghathan ke sabase varisht vyakti ko saamaanya rup se ek apatkaaleen prabandhak yaa kshetra main prayukt shabd se vyutpann par aadhaarit kaha jaataa he
 Areas covered under this definition are: prabandhan kii prakruti sthaneey aarthik or saamaajik sthiti par nirbhar karti he
 Some disaster relief experts, such as Fred Knee, have noted that in a way the only real disaster is economic
 kani jaise visheshgyon ne bahut pehle note kiya ki apatkaaleen prabandhan chakra main buniyadi dhaanche, saarvajanik jaagrukta or yahan tak ki maanav nyaay ke muddon par dirghakaalik kaam ko shaamil karnaa chahie
 The process of emergency management has four stages: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery
 haal hi main homeland security vibhaag or femaa ne EM ke pratimaan ke bhaag ke rup main "samutthan" or "rokthaam" shabdon ko apanaaya he
 The second term was enacted by PKEMA 2006 into law by the Act in October 2006 and has come into effect from 31 March 2007
 donon shabdon kii paribhaashaayen alag charnon ke rup main saralata se upyukt nahin hoti he
 Prevention is 100% mitigation by definition
 samutthan chaar charnon ke lakshya kaa varnan karata he: durbhaagya se aasaani se ubarne yaa parivartan se taal-mail bithaane kii kshamta Mitigation action is an attempt to reduce the impact of disasters in the event that hazards are prevented or occur in disaster
 newnikaran charan anya charnon se bhinn he kyonki yah jokhim ko kam karne yaa nasht karne ke liye dirghakaalin upayon par kendrit hota he
 Implementation of mitigation strategies can be considered part of the recovery process if implemented after a disaster occurs
 newnikaran upaay sanrachanaatmak yaa gaiyr-sanrachanaatmak ho sakate hai
 Structural measures use technical solutions like flood dams
 gaiyr-sanrachanaatmak upayon main shaamil hai kanoon, bhoomi-upyog yojana or beemaa
 khataron ke prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye newnikaran sabase adhik laagat prabhavi tarika he lekin yah hameshaa upyukt nahin hota
 Mitigation includes arranging regulations regarding evacuation, imposing sanctions against those who oppose compliance with regulations, and informing the public of potential risks
 Some structural mitigation measures may adversely affect the ecosystem
 newnikaran kii purvavarti gatividhi jokhim kii pahchaan he
 Physical risk assessment refers to the process of identifying and evaluating hazards
 khatra-vishesh jokhim kisi vishisht khatre kii sambhaavna or prabhaav ke str donon ko jodta he
 According to the following equation, multiplying the risk and the vulnerability of the population to that hazard produces risk catastrophe modeling
 jitna ucch jokhim utana adhik zaruri he ki khatra vishisht arakshittaayen newnikaran or tatparta ke prayaason se lakshith hai
 However, vulnerability is not a threat, for example earthquakes occurring in uninhabited deserts
 prakritik aapadaaon, aatankwaadi krityon or anya maanav nirmit aapadaaon kii rokthaam or inase suraksha, pratyuttar, ubarne or prabhaavon ko kam karne ke liye prabhavi samanvay or kshamtaaon main vruddhi sunishchit karne ke liye yojana, aayojan, prashikshan, las karnaa, abhyaas, moolyankan or sudhaar gatividhiyon kaa satat chakra tatparta he

 in pranaaliyon ko ekikrut kaman or aapasi sahaayta ke siddhanton ke madhyam se shashakt kiya jaataa he
 Responding to any disaster requires both discipline and agility

 This allows the team to move forward with coordinated, disciplined responses that are more or less correct and adapt to new information and changing circumstances
 ubarne vaale charan kaa uddeshy prabhavit kshetra ko yathapurv sthiti main behaal karnaa he
 Its goal is different from the response phase, the recovery efforts are related to issues and decisions that must be made after the immediate needs are met
 ubarne ke prayaas mukhya rup se nasht sampatti, punarrozgaar or anya aavashyak buniyadi dhaanche kii marammat sambandhi kaary hai
 Efforts should be made to "improve back" with the aim of reducing pre-disaster risk in the community and infrastructure
 anyathaa alokapriy newnikaran upayon ke karyanvayan ke liye 'alpakaaleen avasar' kaa laabh uthaanaa, ubarne ke prabhavi prayaason kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he

 There may be many forms of preparedness measures, including the construction of shelters, the installation of warning devices, the construction of pro-lifeline services, and the rehearsal of evacuation plans
 do saral upaay aavashyaktaanusaar ghatana se nipatane yaa nikasi main madad kar sakate hai
