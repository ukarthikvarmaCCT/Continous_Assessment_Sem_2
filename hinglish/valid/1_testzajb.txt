 Love or love is a feeling
 pyaar anek bhaawanaaon kaa, ravaiyon kaa mishran he jo parsparik sneh se lekar khushi kii ore vistaarit he
 It is a strong attraction and a sense of personal engagement
 ye kisi kii dayaa, bhaavana or sneh prastut karne kaa tarika bhi mana ja saktaa he
 To act or show affection towards oneself, or to an animal, or to a human being can be called love
 kehete hai ki agar pyaar hota he to hamaari zindagi badal jaati hai
 The ancient Greeks recognized four types of love: kinship, friendship, romantic desire, and divine love
 pyaar ko aksar vaasana ke saath tulana kii jaati he or parsparik sambadh ke taur par romani adhiswar ke saath tola jaataa he, pyaar dosti yani pakki dosti se bhi tola jaataa hai
 Love is generally a feeling that one person feels towards another person
 agar ham prem kii baat karen to prem jivan he jis tarah H+o2 =h2o hota he thik usee tarah se pyaar bhi do logo ke bich milakar jivan kaa nirmaan karata he Love is a chemical because it is not a yantra, but a solution, of the seer and the vision
 soundarya ke drishy tabhi drashtaa kii drushti main vilyit ho pate hai,or yahi avasthaa prem kii avasthaa hoti he
 The process of origin and stimulation of love and beauty starts from the beginning
 soundarya manushya ke vyaktitv ko prabhavit karatasatya sanathan he, or prem us soundarya main samaaya rahata he
 There is attachment in love
 yadi aasakti na ho to prem prem na rahakar keval bhakthi ho jaati he
 Love is the stage between fascination and devotion
 ek vyakti kisi vastu, yaa tatv, yaa lakshya se prem kar saktaa he jinase wo juda he yaa jinka wo sammaan karata he
 Human beings can also love any thing, animal or work with which they feel personal association and want to keep themselves connected
 avaiyaktik pyaar saamaanya pyaar jaisaa nahin he, ye insaan ke aatma kaa nazariyaa he jisase dusron ke prati ek shaanti-purvak maansik ravaiya utpann hota he jo dayaa, sanyam, maafee or anukanpa aadi bhavanaaon se vyakt kiya jaataa he
 If it is said in a simple sentence, impersonal love is said to be the behavior of a person towards others
 isiliye, avaiyaktik pyaar ek vastu ke prati insaan ke soch ke upar aadhaarit hota he
 The love between human beings is called mutual love
 ye sirf ek duusare ke liye chaah nahin he balki ek shaktishaalee bhav he
 Love whose feelings are not exchanged is called non-refundable love
 aisa pyaar parivaar ke sadasyon, doston or premiyon ke bich paaya jaataa hai
 Mutual relationship is strong, deep and close cooperation with two human beings
 ye rishta anumaan, ekajutata, niyamit vyapaar baatcheet yaa samaajik patibaddhit kaarnon se banataa he
 They are influenced by social, cultural and other factors
 ye prasang parivaar, rishtedaari, dosti, shaadi, sahakarmi, kaam, padosi or mandir-masjid ke anusaar badalata he
 It can be regulated by law or by customs and mutual agreement
 ye samaajik samoohon or samaaj kaa aadhaar he
 In biological models of sex, love is shown as hunger and thirst
 hellen fisher, pyaar kii pramukh visheshgy hai
 They have divided the experience of love into three parts: lust, attraction, attachment
 havas yon ichha hoti he
 Romantic charm determines what attracts you in your partner
 aasakti main ghar baant ke jeena, maan-baap kaa kartavya, aapasi raksha or suraksha kii bhaavana shaamil he
 Lust is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes sexual intercourse
 ye samagam or rasayan kii rihaai ko badhaava detaa he
 Its effect lasts for a few weeks or months
 aakarshan ek vyaktigat or romani ichha he jo ek hi manushya ke prati he jo havas se utpann hoti he
 This increases commitment from one person
 jaise jaise manushya pyaar karne lagate hai, unke mastishk main ek prakaar ke rasayan kii rihaai hoti hai
 Stimulates the center of happiness in the human brain
 is vajah se dil ki dhadakanen bad jaati hai, bhukh nahin lagati, neend nahin aati or utsaah kii teevr bhaavana jaagrrit hoti he
 Attachment is an attachment that enhances relationships over the years
 aasakti patibaddhta par nirbhar karti he jaise shaadi, bachche yaa dosti par
 Cognitive and social phenomena are represented in psychology
 manovigyaani robert sternberg ne pyaar ke tribhujaakar siddhant ko sutarabaddh kiya hai
 He argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion
 atmiyata wo tatv he jisamen do manushya apane aatmavishvaas or apane zindagi ke vyaktigat vivaran ko baantate hai
 It is mostly seen in friendship and romantic work
 patibaddhta ek ummid he ki ye rishta hameshaa ke liye kaayam rahegaa
 Finally there is sexual attraction and passion
 aveshpurna pyaar, romani pyaar or aasakti main dikhaaya gaya he
 All forms of love are a combination of these components
 pasand karne main atmiyata shamil hoti hai
 Enchanted love only involves passion

 In opposition to this, Henry VIII wrote a treatise in 1521 AD in which he gave the authority of the bishop of Rome
 isapar henry ko rome kii ore se dharmarakshak kii oopaadhi mili 
 The pope later denied Henry's first marriage to be invalid and allowed him to have a second marriage

 The Anglican Church considers itself a part of the Catholic Church despite being separated from Rome
 saidhantik drushti se uskaa sthaan roman katholic carch tathaa protestant dharm ke bich main he
 The Anglican Church has special significance in this and for this reason it has been given the title of 'bridge Church' because it is situated between the two like a bridge
 vah protestant dharm ke samaan rome ke vishap kaa adhikaar asweekaar karata he kintu vah roman katholic carch kii bhanti sikhalaataa he ki bible isai dharm kaa ekmaatr aadhaar nahin he
 In addition to the Bible, he also accepts the decisions of the first four General Assembly of the Catholic Church and gives great importance to the ancient tradition of the Church in the interpretation of the Bible

 is dal kaa naam 'hai carch' rakhaa gaya or vah 17veen shatabdi ke purvardh main bishap lard ke netritv main kuch samay tak sarvopari rahaa
 In the last century, the importance of this ideology increased again by the Oxford Movement

 Nowadays, the word 'modernism' is also being used for this

 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne san 1948 main swasthya yaa aarogy kii nimnlikhit paribhaasha di: Health is not just the name of absence of diseases
 hamen sarvangin swasthya ke bare main jaankaree hona bohot aavashyak he
 The meaning of health is different for different people
 lekin agar ham ek saarvbhaumik drushtikon kii baat karen to apane aapako swasth kehane kaa yah arth hota he ki ham apane jivan main aanevaali sabhi saamaajik, shaareerik or bhaavnaatmak chunautiyon kaa prabandhan karne main safaltaapurvak sakasham hon
 Although in today's time, a lot of modern technology has been present to keep yourself healthy, but all these are not as effective
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar, swasthya sirf rog yaa durbalata kii anupasthiti hi nahin balki ek purna shaareerik, maansik or saamaajik khushhaali kii sthiti he
 Healthy people are able to cope with everyday activities and adapt themselves to any environment
 rog kii anupasthiti ek vaanchhneeya sthiti he lekin yah swasthya ko purnataya paribhaashit nahin karata he
 It is not a criterion for health and cannot be considered sufficient for health building alone
 lekin swasth hone kaa vaastavik arth apane aap par dhyaan kendrit karte hue jivan jeene ke swasth tareekon ko apanaaya janaa he
 If we desire an integral personality then we should always be happy and also keep in mind that the dimensions of health are like different pieces
 atah agar ham apane jivan ko koi arth pradaan karnaa chaahate he to hamen swasthya ke in vibhinn ayaamon ko ek saath feet karnaa padegaa
 In fact, the concept of good health is the name of overall health which includes physical health, mental health, intellectual health, spiritual health and social health
 shaareerik swasthya sharir kii sthiti ko darshata he jisamen isaki sanrachana, vikaas, karypranali or rakrakhaav shaamil hota he
 It is a common condition of a person taking into account all aspects
 yah ek jeev ke kaaryaatmak or / yaa chayapachay kshamta kaa ek str bhi he
 Following are some ways to ensure good physical health- maansik swasthya kaa arth hamaare bhaavnaatmak or aadhyatmik lacheelepan se he jo hamen apane jivan main dard, niraashaa or udaasi kii sthitiyon main jivit rahane ke liye sakasham banaati he
 Mental health is the ability to express our feelings and adapt to the many demands of life
 ise acha banaae rakhane ke nimnlikhit kuch tareeke hai- It is the cognitive ability to develop skills and knowledge to enhance one's life
 hamaari bauddhik kshamta hamaari rachanaatmakataa ko protsaahit or hamaare nirnay lene kii kshamta main sudhaar karne main madad karata he
 Our good health is incomplete without being spiritually healthy
 jivan ke arth or uddeshy kii talash karnaa hamen aadhyatmik banaata he
 Spiritual health reflects our personal beliefs and values
 achche aadhyatmik swasthya ko praapt karne kaa koi nirdhaarit tarika nahin he
 It is a way to look deeper into our understanding of our existence
 chunki ham saamaajik jeev hai atah santoshjanak rishte kaa nirmaan karnaa or use banaae rakhana hamen swaabhaavik rup se aata he
 Being socially accepted by everyone is well connected to our emotional well-being
 adhikansh log achche swasthya ke mahatva ko nahin samajhate hai or agar samajhate bhi hai to ve abhi tak isaki upeksha kar rahe hai
 Whenever we talk about health, our focus is limited to physical health
 ham baaki ayaamon ke bare main nahin sochate hai
 We all need good health
 yah kisi ek vishesh dharm, jati, sampradaay yaa ling tak simit nahin he
 Therefore, we should think seriously about this essential item
 adhikansh rogon kaa mul hamaare man main hota he
 a person is said to be healthy when his body is healthy and mind is clean and calm

 The definition of healthy person in Ayurveda is given as follows- acharya charak ke anusaar swasthya kii paribhaasha- According to Kashyapamhita, the symptoms of health swasthya kii ayurveda sammat avadharana bahut vyapak he
 In Ayurveda, the state of health is called Prakriti and the state of unhealth or disease is called pathology
 chikitsak kaa kaary rogaatmak chakra main hastkshep karke prakritik santulan ko kaayam karnaa or uchit aahaar or aushadhi kii sahaayta se swasthya prakriya ko dubaara shuru karnaa he
 The function of medicine is to help nature to regain lost balance
 ayurvedic manishiyon ke anusaar upachaar swayan prakruti se prabhavit hota he, chikitsak or aushadhi is prakriya main sahaayta-bhar karte hai
 The laws of health depend on basic cosmic unity
 brahmad ek sakriy ikai he, jahaan prayek vastu nirantar parivartit hoti rahati he; kuch bhi akaaran or aksmaat nahin hota or prayek kaary kaa prayojan or uddeshy hua karata he
 Health can be defined as the harmony of one's self and its environment
 vikruti yaa rog hone kaa kaaran vyakti ke swa kaa brahmad ke niyamon se taal-mail na hona he
 The duty of Ayurveda is to maintain the natural balance of the body and to harmonize it with the rest of the world
 rog kii avasthaa main, iskaa kartavya upatantron ke vikaas ko rokane ke liye sheeghra hastkshep karnaa or deh ke santulan ko pun: sanchit karnaa he
 In the initial state, the disease elements are temporary and natural balance can be restored by simple practice
 yah sambhav he ki aap swayan ko swasth samajhate hon, kyonki aapkaa shaareerik rachanatantra thik dhang se kaary karata he, phir bhi aap vikruti kii avasthaa main ho sakate hai agar aap asantusht hon, sheeghra krodhit ho jate hon, chidchidapan yaa bechaini mahasoos karte hon, gahari neend na le pate hon, aasaani se farig na ho pate hon, ubaasiyaan bahut aati hon, yaa lagaataar hichakiyaan aati ho, ityadi
 According to age, strength and nature, Pancha Mahabhutta resides in a healthy person
 isse pachan kriya thik prakaar se kaary karti he
 Digestion of food is done and juice, blood, meat, fattening, bone, marrow and Venus are properly formed of these seven metals
 isse mel, mutr or swead kaa nirharan bhi thik prakaar se hota he
 Explaining the measures to protect health, Ayurveda says- arthath sharir or swasthya ko sthir, sudrudh or uttam banaaye rakhane ke liye aahaar, swapn or brahmacharya - ye teen upastambh hai
 'up' means assistant and 'pillar' means pillar
 in teenon up stambhon kaa yatha vidhi seven karne se hi sharir or swasthya kii raksha hoti he
 Along with this, the reasons that make the body sick are also discussed, namely- arthath dhi, dhruthi or smriti ke bhrasht ho jane par manushya jab ashubh karm karata he tab sabhi shaareerik or maansik dosha prakupit ho jate hai
 These evil deeds are called 'pragyaapradha'
