 By now he must have either lived or died

 Monalisa is the immortal artwork of the legendary Italian artist Leonardo de Vinci painted by Vinci between 1503 and 1507

 Paul and the Virgin and Child with St
 Also made two other works of art called Andre

 The classic artist Leonardo da Vinci, who created the artwork, was born in 1452 in a small town called Vinci, in the east of Florence, Italy

 Seeing Leonardo's keen interest in art since childhood, the father sent him to Paris for higher education in art
 jo ki us samay kala shiksha kaa ek pramukh kendra tha, yahan rah kar ve ek berakia ke studiyon main kala kii shiksha lene lage
 While staying here, Leonardo gained extensive knowledge of painting from his guru and became aware of its specifics
 sheeghra hi guru ne mahasoos kiya ki unka shishy unase bhi kahin guni va pratibhavan he, atah guru ke paas jitna bhi gyaan tha, apane shishy vinci ko de diya
 In addition to painting, Leonardo also specialized in engineering, study of human anatomy
 rhite bandhuon ke janm se saikadon varsh pehle jab hawaii jahaaj kii kalpana bhi mushkil thi tab liyanardo ne hawa main udne vaali mashin kaa model banaaya tha
 With the passion to understand the complex structure of the human body, Leonardo would dig into the cemetery from the cemetery in the darkness of night and bring it to the studs
 maanav sharir ke aantarik angon ko katate va unki draning banaakar vistrut nots likhte
 These historical sketches and comments are still preserved today, so Leonardo has made hundreds of paintings and drawings in his life, some of which are names of famous works of art, the more fame the masterpiece Monalisa got on Da Last Supper, Madonna Inn, etc
 Hai, he is really amazing

 newland kaa vishwaas he ki monaalisa ne apane pet main pal rahe bachche kii smriti va anusansha se apana chitra banwaaya tha
 His statement is that because of the thrill of new life coming into the world and the happiness that pulverizes motherhood, it is this unique and wonderful smile on his face

 According to Pallanati, the houses of Leonardo's father Sir Pierre and Francisco were not far apart, but the two families had close relations

 While Monalisa's mysterious smile has remained a mystery for centuries, German art historian Ms
 Maik bogt-lairesen has claimed that the woman seen in the photograph is Ishabella, wife of Duque of Arango Prefecture, Italy
 sushri mike ke anusaar ishabela kii muskaan main dukh he kyonki liyanardo ke painting banane se kuch samay pehle hi uski maan kaa dehant ho gaya tha
 Ishakella's drunken husband would often beat and beat her after getting drunk
 apni prakashit pustak ‘hu ij monaalisa ’ insearch main anekon samantaanen ginvaayi hai
 The book further states that Leonardo, who was a royal artist in the court of Duque, was very close to Isabella
 kareeb 8 varsh purv japan main daanton ke ek doctor ne yah kah kar sabko hairat main daal diya tha ki monaalisa kii rahasyamayi muskaan kaa raaj uske upree jabade main aage ke do daanton kaa tutaa hona he or isi kaaran uske upree hoth ek taraf kuch dabaa hua-sa dikhaai de rahaa he, isi kaaran uskaa ek upree hoth ek taraf se kuch dabaa hua sa dikhaai de rahaa he
 This is why Monalisa and the mysterious smile appear in the unknown when it is not really a smile but an attempt to push the lips from the tongue with its broken teeth so that the lips do not look pressed
 yah doctor pichley kai varshon se monaalisa par shodh kar rahe the
 In December 1986, Ms
 Lillian Swadze, a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories in the US, created a world-wide buzz on the basis of her research, saying that Leonardo Vinci's famous artwork Monalisa is not a mysterious woman but her own self-portrait of a painter
 art and entics naamak patrika main prakashit lekh main sushri lilian ne daawa kiya ki 1518 main laal chaak se bane linordovinci kaa aatmachitra va monaalisa ke chitra ko jab usne paas-paas rakhaa to yah dekhakar dang rah gai ki liyanardo tathaa monaalisa ke chehre, ankhen, gaal, naak va baalo main adbhat samanta he
 With the help of a computer, she was completely transformed into Leonardo when she was seen wearing Leonardo's hair, beard, and hair on top of Monalisa's face
 iske vipareet liyanardo ke chehre se yadi dadhi, bal, munch, bhave aadi hataa di jaye to liyanardo monaalisa main badal jate he
 Sword ji states that Leonardo has portrayed himself as Monalisa
 unhone iske peeche ek kalakaar kaa samalangik hona pramukh kaaran bataaya he
 There is a strong possibility that Vinci is gay and is interested in adapting bisexual themes into the artwork and due to this trend he portrayed himself as a woman and named her Monalisa

 swan yaa dhwani-parivartan se sadaa arth-parivartan nahin hota he, jab ki swanim-parivartan se arth-parivartan nishchit he
 The phonemes are the shortest unit of spoken language, making the difference between two sounds clear
 is prakaar yah bhi spasht he ki swanim kaa sambandh dhwani se he
 If the sound is related to pronunciation, then it is also associated with hearing
 yadi dhwani suni nahin jaaegi to uskaa astitv bhi sandigdh hoga
 The phonemes have been said to be related to physiology and physics due to the pronunciation and auditory relations of sound, because if the pronunciation and hearing process are related to physiology, then the movement is completely related to physics

 The difference between 'jaan' and 'paan' is based on the variation of phonemes

 On the basis of these different meaningful sounds, there is also a difference of meaning in 'knowledge' and 'paan'
 inhen sarthak dhvaniyaan ko dhwani vigyaan main swanim kehete hai
 There is a subtle difference between the 'no' sounds of those two words, because if any person will pronounce a sound twice, it is natural to have a subtle difference in them; For example, there is no difference between the different 'no' sounds of words like paan, jaan, pani, manu, menu, mane, as if etc
, but on subtle thinking there is a knowledge of subtle differences in these sounds

 Use the ~ sign for this; As- wall> wall / r / ~ / l
 kisi shabd ke aadi, madhya or ant main prayukt hone par yadi arth-parivartan ho, to swanim rup nishchit ho jaataa he; yatha - 'aap' shabd ke aadi or ant main 'ja' prayog se arth-parivartit rup is prakaar milte hai - Thus 'h' is phoneme
 'l' swanim ko is prakaar dikhaa sakate hai - The sound introduced is only in the beginning, its meaning does not change
 ant main swanim nahin he

 geet ko kshetreey dhwani nahin dene ke liye baad main porto rico vaali line ko geet ke ant main sthanantarit kar diya gaya or phir unhone video kii kahani likhnaa shuru kar diya
 Fonsi first wanted to write it as a cumbia and pop song, but later began considering giving it an "urban injection" and contacted reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee via whatsapp to listen to a demo of Fonsi's song After agreed to work together
 "despasito" se pehle, fonsi or daddy yanki ne "una opertunidad" par ek saath kaam kiya tha, jo 2010 main digital release kiya gaya tha

 Fonsi said that both Daddy Yaki and he were surprised after hearing the final song, as it sounded "powerful, fresh and different"
 lui fonsi ne yah bhi kaha ki vah ise regeton geet nahin maanate, lekin lagata he ki "isamen regeton kii urja or halaki urban beats hai
 "at the same time he also confirmed that Daddy Yankee's work was a plus for the song because the song" needed the explosion that only he could bring to the song
 " ander ne kaha ki geet "kai parivartanon se gujara" jab tak fonsi ko vah nahin mila, "jo vah chaahate the
 " fonsi ne kaha ki unhone "despasito" ko ek nrity yogya geet isliye banaaya kyonki "latin ke logon ko khush rahane ke liye janaa jaataa he" or vah ullaspurn sangeet kii jarurat mahasoos karte hai
 He added that the song's "urban feel" is a type that "breathes in and out" and is "synonymous with party"
