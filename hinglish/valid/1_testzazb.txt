 lekhaakaran main dohari pravishti pranali yaa dohari khatan pranali bahikhaata kii ek paddati he
 Its name is 'double entry' because under it it is necessary to have a reverse entry in another account corresponding to each entry of an account
 udhaaharan ke liye, 100 rupe kii kamai ko darj karne ke liye do pravishtiyaan aavashyak hongi- It is also called 'bi-marking system' in Hindi
 dwi-ankan pranali aadhunik yug main bahi khate kii dwi-ankan pranali ko sarvshereshth, sarv-saamaanya or sarvyaapee mana jaataa he kyonki yah aadhunik, vaigyanik or purna he
 It serves all the purposes of the businessman
 iskaa janm pashchimi deshon main hua he, atah ise paashchaatya lekhankan vidhi bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is also called business accounting system, as cash and credit transactions are scripted according to this method
 dwi-ankan pranali kii bhinn-bhinn vidwaanon ne alag-alag paribhaashaayen di hai jisamen se kuch nimnlikhit hai- carter ke anusaar, ‘lekhankan kii aadhunik padvati dwi-ankan pranali ke naam se jaani jaati he
 The two-marking system of bookkeeping refers to both personal and impersonal accounts
 kiler dwi-ankan pranali kii nimnlikhit paribhaasha dete hai- ‘ek udhyam me lekhankan kii sarvasaamaanya pranali dwi-ankan pranali he
 As the name itself suggests - two accounts are taken of each transaction - one in debit and the other in credit
 prayek vyapaarik sauda jo dravya athwa dravya ke mulya main parinit hota he, laabh ko dena or us laabh ko praapt karnaa
 In other words, a trade deal is the name of change in value or change in value of money, or each trade transaction gives rise to two actions - acquiring a valuable commodity and giving something valuable
 dwi-ankan pranali ke anusaar in daanon hi, prapya paksh or dey paksh, pakshon kaa lekhankan kiya jaataa he
 So, if a building has been purchased from Mukesh, the building gets the account and gives the account of Mukesh
 isliye prayek saude ke purna lekhankan ke liye dwi-pravishti hona aavashyak he
 For a clear understanding of the rules of the two-uncle system, it is necessary to know that some transactions are the same in almost all trades
 ye samaan saude nimna he- Hence, it is concluded that for the complete accounting of entire business transactions, it is necessary to keep the following accounts- ve khate jo pratham samooh main aate hai vyakitgat khate kehalaate hai, duusare samooh ke antargat aane vaale khaaton ko sampatti khate kaha jaataa he or tisare samooh main aane vaale khaaton ke nammaatr khate kaha jaataa he
 The bi-notation system divides the page into two equal half-parts
 prishth ke vam paksh ko debit paksh tathaa dakshin paksh ko credit paksh kaha jaataa he
 There was no definitive reason for such selection of parties representing different deals and the credit side could very easily be the left side or the debit side being the south side
 venecian vyapaariyon ne jo dwi-ankan pranali ke sarvapratham gyaat vyapaaree the vam paksh yaa debit paksh ko sampattiyon ke liye or duusari ore ko puunji evam deytaon kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye chun rakhaa tha
 Therefore, it is running the same way from everyone
 khaataa ek aisa abhilekh he jisamen ek vishesh pakshakaar dwaara die gayi yaa praapt kiye gayi prayek laabh ke dravya mulya or vam pakshon ke do alag-alag stambhon main vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 Each account has a debit side and a credit side
 yah kramshah khate ke vam paksh evam dakshin paksh ke haashiye par ‘debit’ or credit’ likhakar darshaya jaataa he
 a word is written in front of each entry on the debit side
 iskaa arth yah he ki jis khate kaa abhilekh taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he vah us khate kaa jiskaa ki naam pravishti main likhaa gaya he dendar he
 On the other hand, the word is written in front of the credit side entry
 iskaa arth yah he ki us khate ko jis khate kaa abhilekh taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he is khate se jiskaa ki naam pravishti main likhaa gaya he credit kiya gaya he
 The account name is written in the middle above the account
 laabh dene vaale pakshakaar ke khate ko lender kaha jaataa he or jo pakshakaar is ko prapt karata he uske khate ko dendar kaha jaataa he
 Normally the value of profit received by the account is written in the left column in the account and it is said that the account was debited at that price
 duusari ore khate dwaara die gaye laabh kii kameet ko khate ke dakshin stambh main likhaa jaataa he or yah kaha jaataa he ki khate ko utani keemat se credit kiya gaya
 These are called debit and credit entries respectively
 niyam yaa siddhant se aashay us saamaanya niyam se he jo vyavhaaron yaa saudon kii dishanirdensh karne main sahaayak hota he
 In fact, this principle is mainly based on three rules
 It is also called 'principles of Double Accounting System'
 dwi-ankan pranali ke niyam khaaton ke anusaar prayog kiye jate hai
 There are three types of accounts in a double accounting system
 ek vishesh khate ko debit yaa credit karne se purv hamen yah dekh lenaa chahie ki vyapaaree dwaara kiye gaye saude se koun si shrenee ke khate prabhavit hote hai yah jaan lene ke pashchaat nimnlikhit niyamon kaa paalan kiya jaayga
 In the case of individual accounts, we debit the account of the person or institution receiving the benefit from the profit received by it and credit the account of the person or institution benefiting from the benefit provided by it
 sankshep main ham kah sakate hai- Property accounts are debited from receipt and credited from known ones
 athwa The amount of each expense or loss is debited and the amount of each income or profit is credited
 duusare shabdon main - It is necessary to know that these rules never change and they will be used strongly in every possible situation
 yah bhi note kiya janaa chahie ki uparyukt prapanchon jaise ki ‘dene vaala’ or ‘paane vaala’, ‘aane vaala’ or ‘jane vaala’ ityadi ko maalik ke drushtikon se na jaanchakar santhaan ke drushtikon se jaancha janaa chahie
 In addition to the above rules of the two-marking system, there are some assumptions and assumptions of accounting
 vaastavik bahikhaata tathaa lekhankan kaary armbh karne se purv inkaa pataa hona aavashyak he
 These rules can also be brought into use easily by remembering in some other experimental way
 iske liye sarvapratham sauda yaa lenden ki prakruti ko pahchaan kar unke do roopon ko alag karnaa aavashyak he
 Generally 90 percent of the transactions are related to cash transactions
 atah spasht he ki inkaa ek rup yaa paksh nagad hoga chunki nagad vaastavik khaataa he atah nagad yadi praapt ho rahaa he tongad khaataa debit or uskaa doosraa paksh chaahe vah vyaktigat, vaastavik yaa avastavik ho bina vichaar kiye hi credit kiya ja saktaa he or yadi nagad ja rahaa he to nagad khaataa credit evam doosraa paksh jo bhi ho vah debit hoga
 Similarly, expenses and income can also be easily identified
 atah samast prakaar se aagam kharchon ko debit evam duusare paksh ko chaahe jo bhi ho credit hoga yadi ek paksh aay yaa laabh se sambandhit he to use credit evam viruddh paksh davit hoga
 Also, whatever item or property is purchased, it will be debited and if sold it will be credited and debited or credited to the party against it
 udhaaharan evam debit / credit ke niyamon kaa vistrut vivaran nimnanusaar haih- Expenditure account, and assets in balance sheet doharaa lekha pranali ke pramukh bhaag nimnlikhit he
 They are also called 'double account system stairs' or 'accounting structure'
 laabh dene vaale pakshakaar ke khate ko lender kaha jaataa he or jo pakshakaar is ko prapt karata he uske khate ko dendar kaha jaataa he
 Normally the value of profit received by the account is written in the left column in the account and it is said that the account was debited at that price
 duusari ore khate dwaara die gaye laabh kii kameet ko khate ke dakshin stambh main likhaa jaataa he or yah kaha jaataa he ki khate ko utani keemat se credit kiya gaya
 These are called debit and credit entries respectively

 There lived a man named Madhusudan in Samatapur city
 vah bahut dhanwaan tha
 Madhusudan was married to Sangeeta, a beautiful and talented girl from Balrampur city
 ek baar madhusudan apni patni ko lene buudhvaar ke din balrampur gaya
 Madhusudan asks the wife's parents to send Sangeeta off
 mata-pita bole- 'betaa, aaj buudhvaar he
 Do not travel for any auspicious work on Wednesday
 ' lekin madhusudan nahin mana
 He said not to accept such auspicious and inauspicious things
 donon ne baiylgaadee se yatra prarambh kii
 One wheel of his car broke after a trip to two Kos
 vahaan se donon ne paidal hi yatra shuru kii
 Sangeeta got thirsty on the way
 madhusudan use ek ped ke neeche baitaakar jal lene chalaa gaya
 After a while, when Madhusudan came back with water from somewhere, he was shocked because his wife was sitting with another person of his face
 sangeeta bhi madhusudan ko dekhakar hairaan rah gai
 She could not make any difference between the two
 madhusudan ne us vyakti se poocha- 'tum koun ho or meri patni ke paas kyon baithe ho?' madhusudan kii baat sunakar us vyakti ne kaha- 'are bhai, yah meri patni sangeeta he
 i have brought my wife away from her in-laws
 lekin tum koun ho jo mujhase aisa prashn kar rahe ho?' Madhusudan almost screaming said- 'you are definitely a thief or a thug
 yah meri patni sangeeta he
 i went to sit under a tree and take water
 ' is par us vyakti ne kaha- 'are bhai! jhooth to tum bol rahe ho
 i went to get water when Sangeeta was thirsty
 maine to jal laakar apni patni ko pilaa bhi diya he
 Now you go quietly from here
 nahin to kisi sipaahi ko bulaakar tumhen pakadava doongaa
 ' donon ek-duusare se ladane lage
 Seeing them fighting, many people gathered there
 nagar ke kuch sipaahi bhi vahaan aa gaye
 The soldiers took them both and took them to the king
 sari kahani sunakar raja bhi koi nirnay nahin kar paaya
 Sangeeta too could not recognize her real husband from both of them
 raja ne donon ko karagaar main daal dene ke liye kaha
 The real Madhusudan was horrified at the king's decision
 tabhi akashwani hui- 'madhusudan! tuune sangeeta ke mata-pita kii baat nahin maani or buudhvaar ke din apni sasuraal se prasthaan kiya
 All this is happening due to the wrath of Lord Buddha
 ' Madhusudan prayed to Lord Budhdev, 'O Lord Buddha, forgive me
 mujhase bahut badi galati hui
 In future, i will never travel on Wednesday and will always observe you on Wednesday
 ' Lord Madhudev forgave him when Madhusudan prayed
 tabhi doosraa vyakti raja ke saamne se gaayab ho gaya
 The king and others were surprised to see this miracle
 bhagwaan budhdev kii is anukampaa se raja ne madhusudan or uski patni ko sammanpurvak vidaa kiya
 On walking some distance, they found a bullock cart on the way
 baiylgaadee kaa tutaa hua pahiyaa bhi judaa hua tha
 Both of them sat in it and walked towards Samtapur
 madhusudan or uski patni sangeeta donon buudhvaar ko vrath karte hue anandpurvak jivan-yaapan karne lage
 Due to the grace of Lord Budhdev, wealth and wealth started to rain in his house
 jaldi hi unke jivan main khushiyaan hi khushiyaan bhar gayi
 By observing Wednesday, all the wishes of women and men are fulfilled

 Psychologists study such phenomena as perception, perception, emotion, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships
 kuch vishesh rup se gahare manovaigyanik achet mastishk kaa bhi adhyayan karte hai
 Psychological knowledge applies to different areas of human action, including issues of daily life and -; Such as family, education and employment and - and treatment of mental health problems

 manovigyaan main adhyayan or anuprayog ke kai upakshetra bhi shaamil hai jaise maanav vikaas, khel, swasthya, udyog, media or kanoon 
manovigyaan main prakritik vigyaan, saamaajik vigyaan or manviki ke anusandhan bhi shaamil hai
 The study of psychology in philosophical context refers to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China and India
 manovigyaan ne madhyakaal main adhik naidanik or prayogtmak drushtikon apana liya jab muslim manovaigyanikon or chikitsakon ne aise uddeshyon ke liye manorog aspataal banane shuru kar die
 In 1802, the French psychologist Pierre Cabanese tried to advance bio-psychology through his essay Reperts du Physique et du Moral d'i hom
 Cabanis interpreted and reasoned about the brain in light of his earlier studies of biology
 Given that sensitivity and spirit are qualities of the nervous system

 That is why 1879 is sometimes called the "date of birth" of psychology

 Other important early contributors to this field are Herman Ebbinghaus, a pioneer in studying memory at the University of Berlin; And the Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov who discovered the learning process known today as Classical Conditioning
 1890 se lekar 1939 main unki mrityu tak, austria ke chiktsak sigmund frud ne manashchikitsa kii ek vidhi kaa vikaas kiya jise manovishleshan ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Fried's understanding of the brain was largely based on interpretive methods, introspection and clinical observations, and particularly focused on unconscious conflict, mental stress, and psychopathology
 frud ke siddhant bahut hi lokapriy ho gaye kyonki inhone kai vishyon jaise kaamuktha, daman or achet mastishk ko mano vaigyanik vikaas ke saamaanya pahaluon ke rup main niyantrit kiya
 At that time, they were widely considered a banned topic and Freud provided a catalyst for them to discuss this openly in all the society
 Although Freud was perhaps best known for his tripartite model of the brain, including his theories about ID, ego and hyper-ego, and the idipus complex, his most enduring legacy is probably not his theories but his clinical innovations, such as Method of free association and clinical interest in dreams

 More recently, however, South African neurologist Mark Solms and other researchers in the developing field of neural psychoanalysis argue that Freud's theories point to the structures of the brain related to Freud's concept, such as libido, drives
 , Stun and repression

 Furthermore, unlike early psychologists Wilhelm Wundt and William James, who studied the brain through introspection, behavioral scientists argued that the components of the brain were not open to scientific inquiry, and scientific psychology should refer only to observational behavior 
 aantarik pradhinidhitiv yaa mastishk ke bare main koi vichaar nahin kiya gaya
 Pragmatism was introduced in the 20th century by American psychologist John B
 Watson, expanded by Americans Edward Thorndyke, Clark L
 Hull, Edward C
 Tolman, and later B
 F
 Skinner
 vyaavhaarikta anya drushtikonon se kai prakaar se vibhinn he
 Behaviorists focus on the behavior – environment relationship and analyze open and personal behavior as the function of an organism, which interacts with its environment

 Concepts such as "brain" and "consciousness" are not used by behavioral scientists, because such terms do not describe actual psycho-scientific phenomena, but are used as hidden explanatory entities elsewhere in the organism
 
 iske vipareet, vyaavhaarikta nijee ghatnaon ko vyavhaar maanata he or unhen khule vyavhaar ke tareeke se hi vishleshit karata he
 Behavior is used for concrete events of the organism, open or private

 manovigyaan ke ek vyapak model ke rup main vyaavhaarikta ke arohan ne, haalaanki, agle prabhavi udhaaharan, sangyanatmak drushtikon ko rasta diya he
 Human psychology developed in 1950, in response to both pragmatism and psychoanalysis

aise kai kaarak hai jo maanviya drushtikon ko mano vigyaan ke anya drushtikonon se vibhedit karte hai
 These include an emphasis on subjective meaning, a rejection of determinism, and references to positive development rather than pathology
 Some of the founding theories behind this school of ideas were the plaintiff American psychologist Abraham Maslow, who created a hierarchy of human needs, and Carl Rogers, the client

 yah itnaa prabhavi ban gaya kii manovigyaan, vyaavhaarikta or manovishleshan main "teesraa bal" kaha jane laga
 Influenced by the work of the German philosopher Martin Hideger and the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, the psychoanalytically trained American psychologist Rölö developed an existential species of psychology between 1950 and 1960
 astitv manovaigyanikon ne tark diya kii logon ko apni maran sheeltaa ko sweekaar karnaa chahie
 And in doing so people must accept that they are free; They have free will, they are free to have expectations and can ignore their own mean path during their lives
 main kaa ki arth nirmaan karne vaali prakriya kaa ek mukhya tatv, he, myth kii khoj, yaa kathatmak praturup jinamein koi vyakti feet ho saktaa he
 From the standpoint of existence, questions are raised not only for the meaning arising out of acceptance of death, but that the attainment of meaning can cover the possibility of death
 austria ke ek astitv manochikitsak or purna aahuti uttarajive victor frankal ne dekha, "ham jo ekaagratha shiviron main rahete the, un vyaktiyon ko yaad rakh sakate hai jo dusron ko aaraam dete hue jhopadiyon main hokar jate hai, apana roti kaa aakhri tukda bhi dusron ko de dete hai
 These may be very few in number, but they provide sufficient evidence that everything can be withdrawn from one person, but one thing: the last freedom of man; Choosing one's attitude, choosing one's own path in any given set of circumstances
 me ne astitv chikitsa ke vikaas main agrani hone main sahaayta kii or frankal ne isaki kai kismon kaa vikaas kiya jo logo therapy kehalaati hai
 In addition to May and Frankel, the Swiss psychoanalyst Ludwig Binsvenger and the American psychiatrist George Kelly can be said to belong to the school of survival
 astitv or maanavtaa vaadi donon prakaar ke mano vigyaani tark dete hai ki, logon ko apni purna kshamta tak pahunchne ke liye bharpoor koshish kerani chahie, lekin keval maanavtaavaadi manovigyaani vishwaas karte hai ki, yah prayaas sahaj he
 For existential psychologists, this effort leads to a worrying morbidity, freedom, and accountability
 vyaavhaarikta, 20 veen shatabdi ke pehle aadhe bhaag main america manovigyaan main prabhavi pratimaan tha
 However, the modern field of psychology remained largely influenced by cognitive psychology
 nium chomuski ne 1959 main bi fif skinner ke maukhik vyavhaar kii samiksha kii, jisane us samay prabhavi bhashaa or vyavhaar ke adhyayan ke vyaavhaarik drushtikon ko chunauti di or manovigyaan main sangyanatmak kranti main yogadan diya
 Chomsky used to think intricately about arbitrary ideas of 'stimulus', 'response' and 'reinforcement', ideas that Skinner derived from animal experiments in the laboratory
 chomuski kaa tark tha ki skinner ke vichaar keval jatil maanav vyavhaar jaise bhashaa adhigrahan par ek aspasht or satahi tareeke se lagu kiye ja sakate hai
 Chomsky emphasized that during research and analysis, a child's contribution to language acquisition should not be neglected and proposed that humans are born with a natural ability to acquire language

 Which gave rise to cognitive as a popular modal of the brain
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke se lekar hathiyaaron kii kriya ke bare main ek behatar samaj viksit karne ke liye sangyanatmak manovigyaan anusandhan kiya gaya
 Cognitive psychology differs from other psychological perspectives in two main ways
 pehla, yah vaigyanik vidhi ke upyog ko sweekaar karata he or pratikon kaa upyog karne vaale drushtikon jaise frud kii mano gatiki ke vipareet saamanytah aatmanirikshan ko khoj kii ek vidhi ke rup main asweekrut karata he
 Second, it explicitly acknowledges the existence of an internal mental state and — such as belief, desire, and motivation — and while pragmatism does not
 haalaanki, frud or gahare manovigyaniyon kii tarah sangyanatmak manovaigyanik daman sahit achet prakriya main ruchi lete hai, lekin unhen prachaalan-paribhaashit ghatakon ke shabdon main spasht karnaa pasand karte hai, jaise ki achetan prasanskaran or antarnihit smriti jo prayogtmak jaanch ke liye uttaradaayi hote hai
 Yet cognitive psychologists have raised many questions on the existence of these components
 udhaaharan ke liye, american manovaigyanik elizabeth lofts ne un tareekon ke pradarshan ke liye mul vidhiyon kaa upyog kiya he jinamein prakat hone vaali yaadon ko daman ke unmoolan ke bajaay chhalrachana ke madhyam se spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Moving forward in the cognitive revolution, over the course of several decades, Herman Ebbinghas has been a pioneer in experimental studies of memory, arguing that higher mental processes are not hidden from view, but instead studied them using experiments can go
 manovaigyanik gatividhi or mastishk or tantrika tantra ke kaaryon ke bich kii kadiyon ko samajha gaya, aisa aanshik rup se kuch logon ke praayogic kaary ke kaaran hua jaise angreji mano vaigyanik aucharles sherington or canada ke mano chiktsak donald olding hebb tathaa aanshik rup se mastishk kshati se yukt logon ke adhyayan se hua
 These brain-body links were elucidated by cognitive neuropsychologists in length
 mastishk ke kaaryon ke maapan ke liye takneekon ke vikaas ke saath, tantrika mano vigyaan or sangyanatmak tantrika vigyaan samakaleen manovigyaan ke teji se badhate hue sakriy kshetra ban gaye hai
 Cognitive psychology is included among other disciplines such as neuroscience under the discipline of philosophy of mind, computer science and cognitive science
 vichaaron ke kai skulon kaa tark he ki ek maargdarshan siddhant ke rup main ek vishesh model kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jiske dwaara sabhi yaa adhikansh maanav vyavhaar ko spasht kiya ja saktaa he

 1959 main bharat main televijan kii shuruuaat ke chaar saal pehle geet ramayana kii avadharana 1955 main hui thi
 During the early days of All India Radio, Pune station director Sitakant Lad wanted to start a radio program that would be entertaining and impart moral education
 unhone isliye kavi or lekhak gajanan digambar modgulakar ke liye apni yojana ko rekhaankit kiya
 Since Ramayana is an Indian epic, Lad and Madgoolkar thought to introduce it in songs
 modgulakarne apane sangeet nirdeshak mitra sudhir fadake ke saath yah chunauti sweekaar kar lee
 Madgoolkar and Phadke thought of introducing a new song every week for a year
 har gaanaa pehle shuukravaar kii subah or phir shanivaar or ravivaar kii subah, subah 8:45 se 9:00 baje ke bich prasaarit hoga
 At the beginning of the program a year was planned for the last song "trivar Jayajayakar, Rama" where Ram becomes king
 lekin 1955 ke hindu calendar main adhik maas tha
 So four songs were added to increase the series to a total of 56
 aakhri geet "ga balano, shriramayana" bana or ram ke rajbhishek ke baad ki kahani bhi jodi gai
 Apart from the number of songs, Phadke was left to music, lyrics and singers on his choice and Madgoolkar was given artistic freedom to convey the story line and the message through that medium
 shuruuaat main, kaarykram gudi padva ke avasar par shuru hone vaala tha, lekin baad main ram navami ke din hua
 On 1 April 1955, at 8:45 am, the first song of the program "kush Love Ramayana Sings" was broadcast
 madgulakar kii patni vidya madgulakar batati he ki madgurkar ne pehla geet likh kar recording ke pehle din fadake ko diya tha; haalanki, fadake ne vah geet kho diya
 With the telecast already scheduled, station director Sitakant Lad asked Madgulkar to rewrite the song, which he angrily refused
 laad ne baad main kavi ko sabhi aavashyak lekhan saamagree se susajjit kamaron main band karne kaa nirnay liya or kaha ki unhe tab rihaai milegi jab ve geet liye taiyaar hon
 Madgulkar memorized and wrote the song again in fifteen minutes so that Phadke could produce the music
 kush or lav ayodhya ke logon kaa or sukhad jivan kaa varnan karte hai; haalanki, niputra raja dasharath or unki teen patniyaan; kaushalya, sumitra, or kaikeyi naakhush hai
 Kaushalya, Dasharatha's eldest wife, regrets that she has no children

 She hears a voice that says she will get four children

 Several months later, at the same house, crime writer Alison Oswalt shifts with her family to write her new book, along with her wife Tracy and two children, 7-year-old Ashlee, who is fond of art-painting on walls and 12 years old Trevor
 Although the local sheriff there instructs him not to shift from here, Allison is aware that a murder has occurred in this house and he will leave after investigating the matter
 ghar kii jaanch dauraan ellison ko chat kii atic-rum se ek baks baraamad hoti he, par baks hataane dauraan vahaan ek bada bichchhu miltaa he jise vah maar detaa he
 Alison also wants to write her book on this murder as an incident because Stephanie, the last 10-year-old girl in the family after the murder, is mysteriously cowed
 idhar ghar main tahakikat se mili baks se ek home projector or 8mm kii standard film negative kii reel cese se ellison ko shurumen sabhi maamuli gharelu home-movie lag rahi thi wo aakhir main us parivaar kii bhayaavah ant kii gavaah he
 For example, the family drowned in a pool in a pool, the whole family was burnt alive in a closed car fire, in a rainy night, cutting dead people instead of cutting grass from the lawn remover, late night the whole family was asleep in a dagger Karanna and the last film where four people are hanged at a court
 is nirmam hatya ko dekhne par ellison kaa dil baith sa jaataa he, yahaan tab usne pool party vaale film main ek or rahasyamay shaks ko paata he or ek ajeeb sa nishaan bhi, or aisa pichhali har film main bhi dekhne ko miltaa he, phir to vah in sabaki ek-ekkar photo printout nikaalata he
 Meanwhile, the light is cut and some sound is heard coming from the attic room of the roof, when Alison reaches there with the help of his DG cam flash, he finds him moving the lid of the projector box, with the rod
 On removing it, a vicious snake crawls out of it
 yahaan us dhakkan par gaur karne use un sami katl kiye gaye parivaar kaa hubahu sketch miltaa he, ellison in sabaki tasviren letaa he, saath hi usee shaks kaa sketch bhi miltaa he jise mi
 bugiman ke naam se dikhaaya gaya he
 Alison was about to leave the Attic room when the floor collapses, despite falling somehow, he falls badly and gets hurt on the feet
 agali subah medical atension ke saath police bhi vahaan tafarih ke liye pahunchati he, local dipti swinski ko ellison dwaara is katl kii padtaal main dilchaspee dikhaata, jiske badale main ellison usase sabhi mrit parivaar kaa biodata or unase sambandhit cese kii file maangata he
 The case study shows that all the families happened on different dates and in the city, the similarity is the mysterious disappearance of a child only after the death of each family
 Before the death of the family member to get some kind of intoxication so that they do not struggle in the time of murder
 or harek film main rahsaymay shaks kii maujudagi or ek shaitani nishaan kaa paaya janaa
 dipti bhi tab is masale ko samajhane ke liye ellison ko local university ke professor jonas se baat karne kii salaah dete he jo aksar aise rahasyamay or pechide caces main police kii madad karte hai
 In the evening watching the film of Alison Law Work '86, the scenes of the slayers are shaken, after calming themselves, they would meet with Professor Jonas on an online chat to which Mr
 Bugiman and the traces depicted in the film relate to the medieval era Baghuul who murders the family in various ways and takes a child from the real world to enslave him to his elusive world
 haalaanki professor ke mutabik yah mahaj ek kahani hi he, to ellison bhi ise sirf ittefaq maanata he
 Then by closing his office, Alison would go to sleep at 3 in the morning and is shocked to hear the sound of the projector running around, but there is no one there when he reaches the office, fearing that he takes the base of the basement club, and heads to his back
 Without the eyes of the same missing children behind, they hide
 vah eshli ke kamare bhi jaataa jahaan wo ek najar dekh darwaja band kar lautataa he, par eshli kii najare steffni par thi jo diwaar saamne usee tasviir ke saath baithi thi jiskaa parivaar ke darkht par fande lagaae log the jisamen bughuul kaa bhi cheharaa tha
 Tired, Alison falls asleep on the couch holding the baseball-club, awake until the next morning
 jaagane par ellison phir offis ke cabin jaataa he, jahaan wo film or projector vaise hi pade rahete he, or baad main dipti sivensky se raat kii aapbeetee sunaata he, dipti use apane vaham ko apni jindagi main haaavee hone se bachane ko mashwara detaa he
 On the other hand, Tracy comes to Alison complaining to Ashley that she is drawing outside the room, but according to Ashley, all this is done by the same Stephanie as Alison is writing her book
 baad main traisi kaa sabar tut jaataa he uske mutabik ellison ne jis ghar par katl kii kitaab likh rahaa he, ab unheen kaa parivaar khatre main aa gaya he
 Here Alison also makes her argument that she only hid this truth for the sake of her family, she had no idea of its effect, and she cannot leave from here without completing her book
 In this debate and argument, almost both are broken
 der shaam apni galati kaa ehsaas hone donon aapasi sulah kar lete hai, or usee raat gahari neend main soya ellison projector chalane kii aawaaj se uth jaataa, offis main nadaarad paane aawaaj kaa peechha karte hue vah atic room jane raste pahunchataa he, chat jane kii seedhiyaan khuli hui thi jisapar upar dekhne par ellison hairat se projector par chal rahi film ko vahi gaayab paanch bacchon ko baitha dekhtaa he, sabhi bachche uski ore dekhte hue khamosh rahane kaa ishara karte he, film main dikhataa daraavna bughuul achaanak hi uske chehre ke saamne aane par ellison dar se cheekhta hua sidhiyon se gir padataa he, udhar chat se wo projector or film me farsh par patakaaya jaataa he
 Allison burns all those things in the backyard, then decides to return to her previous home, taking Tracy and the two children together
 raste main gasht ke dauraan sharriff, ellison ko teji se gaadi chalaata dekh uskaa peechha kar roktaa he, ellison itnaa hi kahata he ki vah apane puraane ghar laut rahaa he or philhal koi kitaab nahin likh rahaa, phir sargent kuch jaruri hidaayat dekar ellison ko aage badhane detaa he
 By the next morning Alison shifts all the stuff to her old house, in the evening Alison sees laptop photos related to the professor's mailed bughuels, which seem to recall past events, revealed to the online professor, who He is looking at the pictures
 He is the vehicle of the Sultanate of Baguhaul and the movement of this real world, most of the pictures were destroyed by the former Christians by calling it illusory
 Aki no further incident
 ellison ko bhi ab lagane lagata he ki usne projector or film jalaakar musiibat se chhutkaaraa paa liya he, phir wo baaki sabhi record kii gai film ko delit kar detaa he
 Then Alison's surprise while keeping the attic room side when she finds the box with the same projector again and this time she gets some more extended clip reels of the extended film
 un ekstended cat andig kii aakhri filmon ke sire jodne darmyaan bhi dipti sivensky kii kaal bhi ellison us film kii puri essembal karne baad hi risive karte he
 According to the information received by the deputy, he has dealt with these crime-related incidents, according to him, each of these families used to live in the same house where the previous family was killed, and they die the next day after changing their house; Like before the arrival of the Stevens family, they st
 While staying at Lewis's house where the Miller family was killed, the Miller family first lived in dilazio's house, where the dilazio family was killed in Laan, then the dilazio family then lived first in Sacromento's house, where Martin 'S family was burned alive in a car parked in his own garage, and Martin lived in the first house where that early family died due to the people dipping on the bridge
 Has had almost Ellison also changed its whereabouts has come timeline of the incident, fears that the next victim now they can be
 dipti use chetate he ki kaatil unke ghar aas-paas ho saktaa he isliye saavdhaan rahe
 Allison, looking at the deputy's call, sees all the footage that the only missing children responsible for the murder of all the family so far were probably under the guise of Bughoul and disappearing in front of him
 ellison ab koi or kadam uthaata use apana sar chakraata mahasoos hota he, tab use apni kaaphi cap ke neeche ek note paper miltaa he jisamen likhaa hota he 'gudnit daddy' or phir ellison gash khaakar gir padataa he
 Here Ashley's presence behind him shows that he has taken drugs, just as Stephanie did under Bughuul
 ellison ko hosh aane par khud ko, apni bivi traisi or bete trevor ko haath-paanv bandhe milte he, jahaan sabake munh main tepe chipki rahati he
 Here Ashley, with her ax and the same 8 mm camera, bends down on Alison, promising that she will make her famous again
 The next scene shows all the walls of the house and the dog-cats, unicorns and previous incidents of blood on the door

 bhubaneshwar ne madhya varg kii vidambnaaon ko katu satya ke pratirup main ukera
 He also has the distinction of being the father of modern units
 ekanki, kahani, kavita, samiksha jaisi kai vidhaon main bhubaneshwar ne sahitya ko nae tevar vaali rachanaaen deen
 a litterateur who developed a new pattern of modern sensations from his works
 premchand jaise sahityakar ne unako bhavishya kaa rachanaakaar mana tha
 One of the main reasons for this was that Bhubaneswar was the creator of thinking far ahead of his creation
 unki rachnaayon main kalathitata kaa bodh he, parantu ascharyajanak rup se yah bhootkaal se na jud kar bhavishya ke saath zyada praasangik nazar aati hai
 In the role of 'caravan', Bhuvneshwar himself has written that 'vivek and logic are the thieves of the third class artists'
 unka yah maananaa unki rachanaaon main spashtatya drashtigochar bhi hota bhi he
 The picture that he carved of transforming a human being into an object becomes even more relevant in today's time
 bhubaneshwar kii sahitya sadhana bahuaiami thi
 His writings in the story, poetry, poetry and reviews all convey a new feeling
 choti si ghatana ko bhi nai, parantu vaastaviktaa ke sarvaadhik sannikat drashti se dekhne kaa najariya bhubaneshwar kii visheshta he
 In 1933, Bhubaneswar's first encounter 'shyama: Ek matrimonial irony' was published in 'hans'
 1935 main prakashit ekanki sangrah ‘kaaravaan’ ne unhen ekankikar ke rup main pratishthit kar diya
 The play 'copper worm' written by Bhubaneswar has the honor of the first inconsistent drama written in any language of the world
 unke dwaara likhit ekankiyon main ‘shyamphek vaivaahik vidmvana’, ‘romanceromaanch’, ‘strike’, ‘oosar’, ‘sikandar’ aadi kaa naam ullekhneey he
 Premchand, the first story of Bhubaneswar, was ranked by Premchand in a representative compilation of contemporary stories, 'adarsh stories of Hindi'
 unki kahani ‘bhediye’ hans ke april 1938 ank main prakashit hui
 This story created a strong foundation in the tradition of modern stories
 kaise registan se gujarata banjaaraa bhediyon se jaan bachaane ke liye unke aage chugga phenkata he
 In this sequence of throwing, both in the story and in life, the first things are thrown which are of relatively less importance
 is kahani ne jivan kii kadvi sachai ko bina laag-lapet ke prastut kiya
 Some writers consider the heart of this story to be the best among the selected conclusions of a management class
 ‘mausi’, ‘ladaai’, ‘maan bete’, ‘mastani’ aadi anya ullekhneey kahaniyaan hai
 Apart from this, Bhubaneswar has also written some poems and critical articles in English and Hindi
 parantu unke krititv ko pahchaanane main logon ne bhul kar di
 Perhaps this was the reason that this unique creator had to spend his life in conflicts and controversies
 premchand ne unase hans se sthai rup se judane kaa aagrah kiya tha
 But this dialogue could not be completed due to unknown reasons
 haalanki unki rachanaayen hans main lagaataar prakashit hoti raheen
 But if he had been associated with Hans, his creation would have been far wider than the world before us
 unke antim samay kii rachanaaon ko sahejnaa vaala unke saath koi nahin tha, jiske falswaroop us dauraan raf kaagajon ke peeche likhaa gaya hindi or angreji kaa purnataya moulik sahitya andheron main gum ho gaya
 All the available works of Bhubaneshwar need to reach the people again today
 lekhak kii rachanaaon ke anushilan se yahi dharna banati he ki pashchim ke aadhunik sahitya kaa unhone acha adhyayan kiya he
 Ibsen, DH seems to be particularly attached to Lawrence and Freud
 zindagi ko unhone kadavaahat, tikhepan, vikruti or vidrupatha se hi dekha tha
 Probably this is the reason why intense sentiments, strong resentment and fierce rebellion have appeared in them
 jivan kii is katu anubhuti ne hi unhen fakkad, nirdvandv or sanyamheen bana diya tha
 Bhubaneshwar created the tradition of Hindi western style unicorn
 unki pratham rachana 'shyama--ek vaivaahik vidambnaa', 'hans' ke disambar, 1933 i
 ke ank main prakashit hui
 After this, other unicorn compositions 'satan', 'A neutral communist', 'marriage of genius', 'mystery thrill', 'lottery' were published
 inhen sangrahit karke unhone san 1956 i
 main 'kaaravaan' sangya dekar prakashit kiya
 All these units bear the mark of the Ekanki style of the West
 vishay-vastu or samasya ke vishleshan main pashchim ke buddhivaadee naatakakaron ibson or sha kaa prabhaav he
 The appendices given by the appendices remind Sha's satire and Freud's sexually-oriented ideology
 bhubaneshwar ke or bhi ekanki prakashit hote rahe- 'mrityu', 'ham akele nahin hai' tathaa 'sava aath baje', 'strike' or 'oosar' in rachanaaon main unki drushti kaa visstaar dekhne ko miltaa he
 By rising above the triangle of sexual problems and love, he also began to see the pain and suffering of the society
 san 1938 i
 main sumitranandan pant dwaara sampadit 'roopabh' patrika main unhone ek bade naatak 'aadamkhor' kaa pehla ank prakashit karaayaa
 From this he has taken a very realistic view of the inauguration of the harsh realities of life
 san 1940 i
 main unhone gogol ke prasiddh naatak 'inspector general' ko lagbhag poun ghante ke ekanki kaa rup diya
 In 1941 AD, in Vishwavani, an experiment titled 'roshni and Aag' appeared, in which the Greek plays resembled Poorvalap
 'kathputliyaan' main unhone pratikwaadi style apanaayi
 The drama of Bhuvaneshwar was seen in mature form in contrast to these experimental works
 'photographer ke saamne' ,'tambe ke keede' main manushya kii badhati hui arthlolupata kaa udghaatan he
 In the year 1948 AD, 'history of Duality' was written alone and in addition to this many historical figures were published - 'foundation of Independence', 'jerusalem', 'alexander,' Akbar 'and Genghis Khan
 in rachanaaon main rashtriyata kaa swar bhi ubhaara he
 The final masterpiece is 'co's car'
 kahaniyaan In memory of mother / translation of Bhuvaneshwar Shamsher Bahadur Singh ruth ke liye / bhubaneshwar Open Sesama! / Bhubaneshwar bauchhaar pe bauchhaar / bhubaneshwar In the fog of the eyes / Bhubaneswar ramesh bakshi dwaara anudit Eye moisture / Bhubaneswar ruth ke prati / bhubaneshwar Birth of a child / Bhubaneswar dimaagi taron ke bich / bhubaneshwar Bertrand Russell was an internationally renowned British philosopher, mathematician, scientist, educationist, politician, sociologist and writer
