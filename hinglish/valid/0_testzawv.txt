 In Jayadeva's Geetgovind, Govardhanacharya has been called Rasasiddha poet
 jayadev, ballalasen ke putr lakshmanasen ke samay bengal ke ek suprasiddh bhakt kavi ho gaye hai
 There were five gems in Lakshmansen's assembly, such fame is well known
 un paanch ratnon main govardhanacharya kaa naam bhi gina jaataa he
 Therefore, Govardhanacharya must have been a contemporary poet of Jayadeva and since Jayadeva mentions Govardhan as a well-known poet, Govardhan must have gained Jaydev's earlier fame

 The allusion here is to the recent "gathasaptashati"

 Govardhan idealized these gathas as his Aryans
 praakrit kaa gaathachand, sanskrit ke aryaalandon ke adhik nikat he at: govardhan ne aryaachand ko hi rachana ke liye chunaa
 Govardhan often imitates the hall not only in the verses but also in the imagery
 parantu isse yah nahin samajhnaa chahie ki aaryasptshati, gathasptshati kaa sanskrit anuwaad maatr he
 Whenever Govardhan wants to express the feeling of a saga, he does not miss the performance of his original talent in it

 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 web rang ve rang hote hai, jo ki web panne roopankan hetu prayog hote hai
 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 a conscript triplet is a six-digit, three-byte plot number, used in HTML to display colors
 teenon bite darshaati hai kisi ek rang ke laal, haraa, nila ghatak
 a byte is from 00 to FF, or 0 to 255
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows : These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in the 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F, BC, 8B
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 Template: Color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
 The lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities are 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%
 are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: shri emke algiri ko bharat sarkaar kii pandrahavin loksabhaa ke mantrimandalmen rasayan evam urvarak mantralay main mantri banaaya gaya he

 Only two of its tractors were sold
 iske baad san 1911 main twin city tractor ingine company ne ek dizin viksit kii jo safal rahi
 The steam engine was invented and developed a hundred years before the inertial engine
 us samay tractor kaa vyavhaar keval gaahne kii mashin ke chalaane main kiya jaataa tha
 After some development in steam tractors, it began to be used for preparing the field, sowing seeds and harvesting crops
 krishi ke liye bhaap tractor upyogi siddh nahin hua, kyonki yah atyant baari evam mandgatigami tha
 Apart from this, there was a need for abundant fuel and evaporative water, which required another man to take care of it

 karshan evam swayanchalan ke tareekon ke anusaar tractor ke do bhed hai: 1
 Chakra Tactor - This tractor is of great importance and is very useful for agricultural works
 chakra tractor yaa to teen pahievaala hota he yaa chaar pahievaala
 2
 Leak type tractors The traction device configuration of such tractors consists of two heavy rails
 isamen lohe ke do pahiyon kaa vyavhaar hota he jinamein se ek chaalak kaa kaary karata he doosraa mandak kii tarah hota he
 This tractor is extensively used for heavy work, such as dam construction and other industrial works
 krishi main iskaa vyavhaar kam he
 According to the utility Karshitra has the following five differences: 1
 saamaanya kaary karshitr - ye karshitr maanak abhikalp ke hote hai, jaise chaar chakravaale yaa li prakaar ke karshitr
 2
 Sarvakarya Karshitra - Almost all types of karishrita works can be taken from such a karishitra
 3
 falodyan karshitr - ye chote yaa madhyam akaarawale yantra hai
 Their texture is such that they can be used to function smoothly in the pods
 is prakaar ke karshitr bahut kam oonchaai vaale hote hai evam inamen bahut kam prakshepi purje hote hai
 4
 Industrial Karsitra - These types of instruments can be of any shape or type
 inkaa vyavhaar kaarkaanon or hawaii pattan ityadi sthanon main hota he
 They are equipped with rubber wheels and high speed transmission devices
 5
 baag-karshitr - yah bagichon yaa chote chote kheton main vyavhaar kiya janevaala sabase chote aakaar kaa tractor hota he
 It is made of three sizes: small size, medium size and large size
 chote akaarawale yantra se bagichon main paudha lagane kaa evam kheti kaa kaary liya jaataa he
 The medium and large sized garden cursor is used for the work of plow etc
 is yantra ko chaalak chalaata he ore uttolak kii sahaayta se ise niyantrit karata he
 All tractors have the following three parts: 1
 ingine or uske saadhan, 2
 power transmission system, 3
 chejis Tractors of ancient times used huge horizontal engines that had only one or two cylinders
 is tarah ke baari bharkam injanon ko sanbhaalane ke liye majboot panjar, bade pahie aadi kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi jiske falswaroop swayan tractor hi bahut baari ho jaataa tha or isamen kaary lene main kathinaayee hoti thi
 Nowadays high speed light engines are being used mainly consisting of two cylinders horizontal engines and four or six cylinders vertical engines
 tactor ingine ke mukhya purje, jaise piston, crack shaft bering, valve aadi motor gaadi ingine ke purjo kii apeksha adhik bade or baari hote hai
 All cylinders are made in the same casting
 tractor ingine ke silinder sheeghra hi nasht hone lagate hai
 These two methods are used to solve this difficulty
 ye vidhiyaan manhagi evam adhik samay lenevaali hoti hai
 That is why modern design engines have their own cylinder walls or sleeves, which can be easily replaced again without the engine being pulled out of the tractor
 sleeve kii keemat nae silinder yaa acha punarvedhan karaane kii keemat se bahut kam hoti he
 Cylinder heads for tractor engines are made by casting separately
 aisa karne se dahanakaksh main jame carbon ko saath karne main sugamawa hoti he
 The valves are placed in the cylinder head to facilitate adjustment of the valve
 tractor piston praaia: dhalaai lohe kaa bana hota he evam isamen teen se lekar saat tak valay lage rahete hai
 The crank shafts of all tractors are made in a single piece by roof mounting
 saadhaarant: bade akaarawale do or chaar silinderwaale ingine 900 se 1,200 or chote akaarawale chaar or chha: silinderwaale ingine 1500 se 2000 parikraman prati minute par chalate hai
 The fuel contained in the combustion engine is gaseous fuel or and second, the blasting ignition emission
 pratham prakaar ke ingine main chushan stroke main keval vaayu silinder main pravesh karti he or vahaan par yah sampeden stroke main sampidit hoti he
 Around the completion of this stroke, the fuel is injected into the hot compressed air by the injector in the form of fuel microwaves that cause combustion
 is tarah ke eenjan main dijal tel kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 The second type of fuel ignition is a mixture of fuel and air in a part called a carburetor and from there the suction stroke enters the cylinder
 silinder main sampeden stroke dwaara mishran ke sampidit hote hi sphuling plag dwaara dahan sampann hota he
 Petrol and gas are treated in such fuels
 dahan ke baad uparyukt donon prakaar ke ingine main prasar stroke hota he jisamen shakti praapt hoti he
 At the end of diffusion, the burnt gas remains at low pressure, which is exhaled by the exhaust stroke and the cycle is repeated
 ingine main garam gaison ke kaaran evam piston ke silinder main pashchaagr chaal ke kaaran gharshan dwaara ushma kii utpatti hoti he jisase eenjan ke purje sheeghra hi kharaab ho jate hai
 To avoid this, the parts of the engine are cooled by cooling or cooling and the heat is reduced
 tractor par padanevaale parivartit bhaar ke saath badalati hui gati main ekarupata laane ke liye tractor ingine par gatiniyantrak kaa rahanaa aavashyak he
 Almost all tractors are equipped with a blocking system of movement
 isamen paribhrami bhaar dwaara honevaale apkendri bal kii sahaayta se gati niyantrit kii jaati he
 There are three parts of the mechanism that transmits the power of a tractor's engine to its wheels or leaks: vibhinn tractaron main ye purje vibhinn abhikalp ke bane hote hai
 This system is a means of self-propulsion
 isaki sahaayta se ingine ke crank shaft kii gati kam yaa adhik kii ja sakati he evam icchaanusaar tractor kii gati praapt kii jaati he
 The momentum is also reversed by this system
 swayanchalit vahiniyon ke shakti ekak ko iske pareshan gear or chaalan pahie se pruthak karne ke saadhan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he kyonki The transmission gear has to be removed to achieve different speeds
 in sari kriyaaon ke liye ingine or pareshan gear tathaa pattak ghirani ke bich grabh kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In these graphs, the contraction graph, cone graph and expansion graph are prominent
 aajkal praaia: sabhi tractoro ke grabh chakti prakaar ke hote hai
 In modern grab design, the behavior of bicameral and monolithic grabs is more in place of multicomponent types
 aadhuniktam abhikalp main shakti pareshan ke liye taral padaarth kii gatij urja yaa daab urja kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In this, fluid coupling and pulsating converter etc
 are prominent
 tractor chejis ke antargat dhaanchaa, pahie yaa karshan ke anya saadhan or modan yantravinyas aate hai dhaanche par yantra ke anya ekak lage rahete hai, isaliye iskaa majboot hona aavashyak he
 Earlier this fix was made by rive joint but nowadays it is made by casting in two parts to make the tractor lighter, smaller and compact, one of which works as engine crank shell and second is transmission transmission
 aajkal praaia: sabhi tractaron ke pahie nimna daab biveey rabar ke bane hote hai kintu dhan kii kheti ityadi ke liye vyavhaar main laae janevaale tractaron main aajkal bhi ispaat ke pahie lagaae jate hai
 The most prominent part of the folding mechanism is the gear which transmits the speed of the folding penalty from the turning wheel
 ye gear hameshaa ek koshth main band rahete hai taaki inamen dhulikan aadi kaa pravesh na ho sake
 The age of any tractor and the work done by it depends on the maintenance of this machine
 is yantra ko jitani hi adhik saavdhaanee se rakhaa jaayga utana hi acha kaary vah degaa or usee ke anusaar yah tikaoo hoga
 This will rarely present difficulty if maintained properly
 praaia: sabhi tractaron main kathinaaiyaan injanon main hi hoti he
 The following four types can occur mainly due to difficulties: kisi bhi ingine ko sugamawapurvak aarambh karne evam dakshatapurvak kaary dene ke liye uchit sampeden na hone kaa karan piston, piston valay silinder, silinder, deevaaron aadi kaa ghisna, silinder sheersh yaa sphuling plag ke chaaron ore chuunaa tathaa balve ke neeche carbon kaa jamaa hona he
 The flow of fuel is interrupted due to some closure of the valve, any external material in the fuelpath, stuck on the carburetor plow, causing less fuel
 kabhi kabhi valve ke neeche mel jamaa hone athwa plav main chhed ho jane ke kaaran eendhan adhik maatra main aane lagata he
 Fuel mixing becomes weak or overpowered when the carburetor is not properly positioned
 dahanakaksh main uchit samay par bijli ke achche sphuling kaa hona bahut se najuk purjon par nirbhar karata he
 a particle of metal, a drop of water or a loose combination of electricity can obstruct the entire ignition system
 iskaa arth hoga vilamb or samay kii kshati
 The lack of starting or stopping the engine while cranking is an indicator of ignition difficulty
 valve ko uchit samay par khulanaa yaa band hona chahie evam piston kii gati ke saath uchit samay par sphuling kaa nirmaan hona chahie
 There is 'periodic difficulty' due to even a slight change in time
 isse chalate ingine kaa prarambhn hone yaa sucharu rup se chalane main baadha nahin hoti he, balki isse ingine kii shakti kam ho jaati he, ingine atyant garam ho jaataa he evam eendhan kii khapat bad jaati he
 By always paying attention to the causes of all these difficulties, the tractor is always in good condition
 yah ek pramukh bandargah he

 Paksha or fortnight is called an interval of 15 days in normal practice
 suvidhanusaar aadha maheenaa yaa do saptaah ke samay ko bhi esa kah diya jaataa he
 However astrology, according to the Indian Panchang or Hindu method of time calculation, is technically the definition of aspect - the time taken by the moon to move from one position to another in the Kalachakra

 Kavalam Madhav Panikkar was a scholar, journalist, historian, administrator and diplomat of India
 ve sardaar ke em panikkar ke naam se adhik prasiddh hai
 The name of Sardar KM Panikkar is definitely mentioned in modern diplomats of India
 panikkar china main lambe samay tak bharat ke rajdoot rahe
 He believed that the birth of diplomacy is related to the birth of modern states in Europe
 rajnay kii paribhaasha dete hue panikkar ne kaha, ”anterrashtriya raajnneeti main prayukt rajnay apane hiton ko duusare deshon se agrim rakhane kii ek kala he
 “diplomacy is an art by which the states of the world cultivate their mutual relations and serve their interests
 panikkar ke anusaar rajanyajna ”ek desh kaa duusare desh main sthit aankh or kaan he
 “A country, through its diplomats, keeps making necessary changes to its foreign policy by getting information about the events, policies and outlook of another country
 bahut se vichaarkon ne chaaturya, kushalta, kapat aadi ko rajanyik gun mana he jabaki panikkar ke anusaar dhoortta, kapat aadi se purna rajnay apane desh ke prati duusare deshon kii shubh kaamana praapt karne kii drushti se prerit hota he or kapat aadi is uddeshy ke maarg main khatarnaak saadhan he
 Good luck of another country, there can be more than four ways to achieve the goal of achievement - other countries should understand the policies of that country properly and have a sense of respect for it, that country should understand the legitimate interests of the people of other countries
 And consider it paramount and he should behave honestly
 aap bahut se logon ko sadaa ke liye dhokhe main nahin rakh sakate
 When the reality of the country's policy is revealed, the level of that country in the world society will be pushed
 panikkar kaa mat he ki vyaktigat jivan kii bhanti anterrashtriya jivan main bhi eemaandaaree sabase acchhee niti he
 Panikkar considered swearing towards the state an essential quality of a diplomat
 unheen ke shabdon main, ”rajdoot ko us niti ko kriyanvit karnaa hota he, jo uski sarkaar nirdhaarit karti he
 This may be different from his own consultations because the government of a country is familiar with the whole situation while the ambassador knows only his specific goals
 isliye jab use un anudeshon ko kriyanvit karnaa padataa he jo aadharbhoot rup se uske vichaaron ke viruddh ho to use bhaavana, pakshpaat athwa maitribhav se prabhavit nahin hona chaiye or kisi bhi sthiti main use sambandhit sarkaar ko apane netra timatimaane ke dwaara bhi yah prakat nahin karnaa chaiye ki uske swayan ke vichaar bhinn nahin he
 The ideal ambassador should not under any circumstances give a rough estimate of the behavior of his government by softening the strict instructions from his country even if the state does not like his country's foreign policy acceptor
 panikkar jo swayan ek safal rajanyigya the, striyon ke sanidhya va sampark ko rajnay kaa sahaayak maanate hai
 In 1926, French Ambassador Jules Camban wrote in an article that the connection of honorable women would be beneficial to the Ambassador
 prasiddh bhartiya vidwaan chanakya rajdooton kii striyon se sampark kaa virdohi tha
 In all countries, women are used since ancient times to increase national interest
 bhartiya itihaas ke ati prachinkaal kii vish kanyaon kaa aisa hi prayog tha

 That girl was actually a German spy
 is clerk ko is aparaadh ke kaaran saat varsh kii sajaa mili thi
 According to Panikkar, an ideal ambassador should not be proud of his success and despair at failure
 panikkar ne rajdoot ke do mul kaaryon se sahmati vyakti kii hai- pratham, apni sarkaar ko sthaneey paristhitiyon tathaa vahaan kii nitiyon se avgat karaae rakhana
 Second is to successfully follow the orders from the country for the implementation of the foreign policy of our country
 kisi bhi rajdoot kii safalataa athwa asafalataa kaa uttardaayitv us desh kii apni videsh niti par honi chaiye, na ki rajanyik par, kyonki rajdoot videsh niti kaa nirmaan nahin karte, yah to uske videsh vibhaag kaa kaary he
 Panikkar is of the view that the most dreadful and final method of pressure behind negotiations is war
 jab samjhaute kii sambhaavna samaapt praayah ho athwa vaarta ke safal parinaam nikalne kii aashaa hi ksheen prathit ho to yuddh dwaara samaadhaan nikaala jaataa he

 aurangzeb ne unhen 'savai' kii oopaadhi di thi - jiskaa pratikatmak-arth yahi he ki ve apane samakalinon se 'savaya' the
 It is heard that when young Sawai Jaisingh first appeared in the court of Delhi Emperor Aurangzeb, it is not known why Aurangzeb suddenly grabbed both the hands of Jaisingh and asked "now tell me, what will you do?" At this, Jai Singh smiled directly at the lips and said with a very calm voice, "alampanah! We have a tradition of marriage among Hindus
" var, vadhoo kaa ek haath apane haath main lekar is baat kii pratigya karata he ki vah uskaa haath jindagi bhar nahi chhodega, umr bhar uskaa saath nibaahega! aaj badshaah salaamat khud meraa ek haath nahin, mere donon hi haath jab apane haath main le chuke hai, fir mujhe kis baat kii parvaah?" aurangzeb ko is chaturaai bhare jabaab kii ummid na thi, lekin is budhimattapurna haazirajavaabi se vah bahut prasann hua

 The news of Bishan Singh's death in Kabul reached the royal camp of Maharashtra on 18 February 1700, usually one and a half months after his death, then two days later, the emperor Aurangzeb changed the name of his eldest son from Vijay Singh to Jai Singh, Accepted the heir to the throne of Amer
 badshaah ne jaisingh ke chote bhai cheema ji kaa naam vijaisingh rakhaa
 According to Yadunath Sarkar "


 Jai Singh remained in Amer since his return from the south in July 1698, when the emperor also sent a number of 'strict calls' to attend him
 From his father's time, the delhi-emperor
 They wanted to call them in the south to take their military service
 parantu raja vishnusingh apane putr ko dakshin main nahin bhejnaa chaahate the
 But in 1698, he went to Maharashtra on the pressure of the emperor
 aath maheene mogul shivi main rah kar ye vaapis apni rajdhani amer laut aaye
 Immediately after sitting on the throne, as noted above, he was called in November 1700 to fight with his army in the south as an army of Mughal emperors, but somehow Jaising continued to evade
 vah jab kai shahi-adeshon kii avhelnaa kar chuke, to antat inhen 'jabaran' le aane ko badshaah ne kuch harkare amer tak bhi bheje| inaki anupasthiti se naaraaz badshaah aurangzeb ne in se amer raja kaa khitaab to nahin chhina, par 13 sitambar 1701 ko inhen 'padaavnat' karte hue maatr 500 jaat, 100 savaar kaa maamuli manasabadaar bana diya

 aurangzeb ke pote shah bidarbakht ke netritv main baadashahi sena ne 11 may i0 1702 ko khilanaa ke kile par baari hamalaa kiya

 khilanaa-yuddh main inkaa vir or bharosemand dewan buddhasingh maaraa gaya
 On this blossom-conquest, King Aurangzeb raised his mansab to 2000, first after the request of Shah Bidarbakht
 badshaah kii chah saal kii 'kathin seva' kaa mahaz yah pratidaan jaisingh ko mila! iske baad jab shahjada bidarbakht malwe kaa soobedaar hua, tab usne jaisingh kii sevaaon kaa sammaan karte un ko vahaan kaa naayab soobedaar bana diya, jise aurangzeb ne tatkaal hi 'naamanzoor' kar diya tathaa ek farmaan likhaa ki ainda kisi hindu bhi ko maamuli faujadaar tak bhi nahin banaaya jaae

 Sawai Jaisingh's political stature was reduced to a modest 'mansabdar'
 badshaah iske baad ajmer hokar dakshin ke liye apane bhai kambaksh se muqabla karne ko badha
 Both the kings of Amber and Jodhpur went with him to the area of mandleshwar

 The nerds attacked him suddenly with guns and arrows
 usamen sab mogul faujadaar maare gayi tathaa mughalon kii jiti hui baaji haath se nikal gai
 Then Jai Singh wrote a letter against the emperor to Durgadas that "speak to Udaipur Maharana 


 Rajputs should do what the pride of 'hindustan' should do against the Mughals, including the Marathas
 " When Emperor Bahadur Shah returned from the south, he considered it necessary to somehow compromise both the Jodhpur and Amer kings
 inhen laane ke liye usne budhsingh haada raja bundi ko bheja, jinke marfat 21 june i0 1710 ko ye ajmer ke paas badshaah ke saamne hajir hue
 The emperor returned the seized states to them and also gave the mansab of 4000 and 4000 riders to these two
 us samay tak bhi rajputon kaa mughalon par bilkul vishwaas nahin tha, isliye jab savai jaisingh ajmer main badshaah ke shivi main gayi tab ajmer ke tamaam pahaad tathaa ghaatiyaan rajput-sainikon se bhari hui thim
 He never had full faith in Bahadur Shah's intention even after Mansab grew and returned to the area
 jaisingh ke bhai vijaisingh ke saath bhi kuch aisa hua ki niraash hokar ant main mughal darbar chhod kar hindun aa gaye
 Jai Singh was still an armed rebellion threat from brother Vijay Singh
 inhone 1713 i0 main vijaisingh se samjhauta karne or 'rajmata se bhent' karne ke naam par apane sashastr sainikon evam saradaaron samet sanganer ja kar dhokhe se unako kaid karvaa diya or jaigarh kile main bhej diya
 Shyam Singh Khangarot was a special assistant in this 'assassination' of Vijay Singh
 bahadur shah kii mrityu ke baad uske uttaradhikari jahandarshah ne amer or marwar donon raajaaon ko phir apane paksh main karnaa chaha
 He also gave the mansab of 7000 castes and 7000 riders to both, but this time they decided to stay away from Aurangzeb's sons in the mutual struggle between the Mughal heirs
 farrukh sier ke mogul badshaah banane ke baad hossain ali saiyad ne shyamsingh khangarot ko bulawaaya tathaa unase baat karke jaisingh ko badshaah se 5000 jaat 4500 savaar kaa mansab dilvaaya
 When At Singh differed with the emperor, the emperor sent Syed Hussain Ali with his army to Ajmer, where Attingh was captured
 us samay jaisingh bhi hossain ali saiyad ke saath the
 In the end there was a treaty with At Singh
 oktober 1713 i0 main inhen badshaah farrukh sier ne malwa kii soobedaari pradaan kii
 He suppressed many rebellions there and also suppressed the nuisance of the marines

 Chhatrasal Bundela was also with him in Malwa

 Then in his absence, he put his Dhabhai Ruparam there as a hero
 1717 tak ye malwa ke soobedaar rahe
 Emperor Farrukh Sier gave the princely state of Bundi to Bhimsingh Hada king Kota and he also captured Bundi
 jaisingh ne prayaas karke badshaah se bundi waapas raja budhsingh hada ko dilvaayi
 The emperor from Delhi ordered them to climb Chudaman Jat of Bharatpur, which had caused a great disturbance in the area of agra from looting
 inke saath bundi ke buddhasingh, kota ke bhimsingh, narvar ke gajsingh, durgadas rathod va kai anya manasabadaar bhi niyukt kiye gayi
 On 15 September 1716, he took his army and left for Mathura
 navambar main chudaaman ke prasiddh kile thun kaa gheraa shuru kiya
 Var Abdullah Khan was against Syed, Jaysingh and was helping Chudaman
 isse inhen is abhiyaan main safalataa nahin mil pai
 Var Abdullah Khan Syed finally took up the circle of Thun after falling in between
 may 1718 main jaisingh kii vaapasi dilli hui
 Despite this failure in the area of chudaman, he was respected by the emperor
 saiyadon or baadshahon ke bich talavaarein khinch chuki thi
 Jaisingh persuaded Emperor Farrukh Sayar that he should be cleaned forever after fighting the Syed
 us samay unke paas 20 hajaar rajput savaar dilli main maujuud the tathaa bundi ke buddhasingh hada bhi unheen ke saath the
 But the king did not dare to take this military action
 vah saiyadon ko kisi tarah khush karne main laga rahaa
 Finally, the Sayyids asked the emperor Jaisingh to leave Delhi
