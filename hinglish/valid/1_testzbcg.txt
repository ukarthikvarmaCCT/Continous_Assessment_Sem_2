samved yaa indriyabodh un shaareerik kshamtaaon ko kehete hai jinase praapt hue gyaan se kisi jeev ko apane vaataavaran kaa bodh hota he
 There are five major sensory organs in humans - seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and tasting
 kintu manushya main inke alaava bhi bahut se samvedon ko grahan karne kii kshamta hoti he, jaise taap aadi
 Other animals have different sense senses, which some fish have senses for water pressure that they can comfortably tell that no other fish is moving around
 kuch anya jaanavar pani main vidyut yaa chumbakeey kshetron main parivartan ko bhaanp lete hai - yaa shikaar karne ke liye bahut laabhakaari hoti he kyonki har anya jeev apane aasapaas vidyut kshetra par prabhaav daalata he
 As soon as the senses acquire knowledge about something in their environment, the object becomes physically "conscious"
 abhi mastishk ne iskaa arth nahin nikaala hota
 There are some such injuries and diseases in the brain in which a person sees things but cannot realize them
 "vizual agnosia" naam ke rog main vyakti cheez dekhakar uskaa vivaran de saktaa he lekin use pahachaanata nahin, jaise ek ghoda dekhakar uski sateek chitra haath se banane main sakasham he lekin yah nahin pahchaan pataa ke yah ek ghoda he
 The reason is that the sense of sensation in these people is perfectly fine, but there have been some problems in the process of learning
 manoj das saraswati sammaan se sammanit sahityakar hai
 His works are in Odia and English
 manoj das oria sahitya ke beesvin satabdi ke uttararddh ke pramukh kahanikar hai
 His first story 'samudar Aapas' was published in 1947
 haalaanki shuru ke dinon main unhone kavita, bhraman kahani tathaa ramyarachana likhaa he par unki sahitya-sadhana kii pradhan vidha he kahani or kahanikar ke rup main hi ve vishesh rup se parichit hai
 Manoj Dasank Katha O
 published in 1971
 Kahaani 'had stories written till then and Manoj Das was approved as one of the leading storytellers of Odisha
 iske baad bhi unke kai anya sangrah prakashit hue hai: ‘lakshmir abhisar’, ‘abu purush’, ‘dhoomabh digant’, aadi
 He is a storyteller in both Oriya and English languages
 ek angreji lekhak ke rup main bhi ve akhil bhartiya str par sweekrut hai or unki angreji kahaniyaan kaafii prashansit hui hai
 Eminent writer Graham Greene called him R
 K
 Have seen with Narayan
 kisi anya ne ke
 hardi, saki tathaa o
 henry ke saath unki tulana kii he
 In his opinion he writes some stories first in Oriya and some in English first
 baad main ve us kahani ko phir duusari bhashaa main likhte hai
 Manoj Das answers the question in which language he thinks that he thinks in the language of Nirav
 manoj das angreji main likhte hue bhi unke sahitya srijan kaa mul strot angrezi yaa videshi sahitya nahin he
 The tradition whose development is seen in his story is Sanskrit and Odiya folklore, Veda, Indian cultural stream of Upanishads and Faqir Mohan Senapati, the originator of modern Odia prose literature
 manoj das ne khud bhi apane lekhan par faqir mohan, somdev, vishnu sharma aadi kaa prabhaav sweekaar kiya he
 Manoj Das also had a lot of success in the field of literature
 unhen sahitya ke kshetra main praapt sammaanon main se oreisha sahitya academy puraskaar kendriya sahitya academy puraskaar, sarala sammaan tathaa vishuv sammaan hai
 Along with this, he has received unqualified support from countless readers
 jin gunon ke kaaran unki kahaniyaan aalochakon or pathakon donon ko priy hai, ve hai shashakt kathanak, mohak tathaa dharapravaah varnan style rahasyamay kinvadantiya vaataavaran or ant main ek avyakt mantavy or naitik arth
 All these qualities can definitely be seen in the stories written from the early stories of Manoj Das
 or inhi sab kaarnon se unki kahani ek baar padhane par use bhul paanaa sambhav nahin hota
 a strong attraction of his story is his intellectualism and emotionality or the balance of heart and mind
 haalaanki unki sari kahaniyaan nirmam bauddhikta main sarabor hai, par ve bauddhikta, bhavukta or aaveg ko dabaati nahin
 At the end of the story, the solution of ethics and education cannot draw the characters of the story out of their everyday routine
 isliye ye saare paatr jivant va sansaarik hai, saadhaaran sukh-dukh ke bhagidaar hai
 Not only because of the pretense of storytelling, it can also be seen in their awe-inspiring stories that the style Manoj Das has adopted to give shape to these characters is also his personal
 unki prasiddh kahani ‘dhoomabh digant’ kii shuruyaat is tarah hoti he: Sometimes i get very depressed after seeing birds in the sky in distant air
 unki us samay kii gati kii us chandaheenata main ahsaas hota he kisi aadhunik rashtriya kavita ko padhate samay kaa asaybodh
 And when suddenly some dried leaves in the whirlwind fly upwards and become invisible, then it seems like i am lost somewhere
 lekin waisi aandhi, pakshiyon yaa sookhe patton kaa khyal kaafii arase baad aaj ek pari-katha padhate samay kyon aayaa, main samaj nahin sakaa
 "A hidden demon on the mountain of Digant", was written in full-length story
 kahani ke prarambh main ek rahasyamay prashn he, akaash, pakshi tathaa aandhi kii soochna or phir ek pariktha kaa ullekh
 As if it were another fairy tale
 parantu yah kahani pariktha kii bhul-bhuulaiya main kho nahin gayi he
 All the characters in the story are blood-meat and depend on human weaknesses and helplessness
 kahani kaa vaktaa swayan bhi ek paatr he
 The theme of the story is Hatu, Naveen and the speaker himself
 kaafii saal pehle apane bachapan kii ek kishori bandhu lily ko pahaad par karun paristhitiyon main kho baithe the
 And the memory of that still surrounds them
 kahani kaa ant is tarah hota he- Like this story, Khud, who tells in many other stories, is also a character in the story
 is style se lekhak kahani ko pathak tak sidhaa pahunchaane main samarth he
 Apart from this, Manoj Das also addresses the readers directly in many stories
 isse lekhak or pathak ke bich ek samvedansheel sambandh ban jaataa he tathaa kahani ke paatr pathak ke or bhi nikat aa jate hai
 Another point of view in this perspective is that the characters in these stories are amazing
 ek drushti se dekha jaae to ye sabhi avastavik va aparthiv hai-maano ye kisi pari-lok ke nivasee hon
 But then on seriously considering that it is only humans of clay who come close to us
 rajkumaar, rajkumariyaan sanyasi yahan tak ki manuettar paatr bhi behad jivant lagate hai
 The skill that Manoj Das uses to give all these characters a mysterious and supernatural appearance is the naming of characters and places
 unke kai paatro ke naam hai-pundaree, hidimb, shankhanaad, haygreev
 Mount Luburbha is described in his multiple stories
 ye naam keval hasyaras ke sanchaar ke liye nahin, desh, kaal tathaa paatro ko rahasyamay banane ke liye bhi prayukt hue hai
 Manoj Das's language and word selection are also helpful in that direction
 unki kahaniyon main hamen miltaa he, ‘‘jhalak-jhalak shubhr vismay’’, ‘‘mrityu him stabdhta kaa aavaran’’, ‘‘timir va krandan se bisharnn prithvi’’, ‘‘bhaaluu-bhaaluu andheraa’’, ‘‘adhamra chaand’’, ‘‘jhonka-jhonka thanthi hawa’’ ityadi
 The words are created in front of the readers in an inappropriate environment
 manoj das kii kahaniyon main rahasy kii soochna kehani ke prarambh main hi mil jaati he
 The first sentence of the story creates a mystery and thrill in the mind of the reader, by which we have to find out the basic elements by reading the story from beginning to end
 yah unki kuch kahaniyon ke nimnlikhit pratham vaakya se hi spasht he- The use of fairy-tale and folk-tale in the stories of Manoj Das has already been told
 ise rup dene main unka shabd-chayan tathaa varnan style sampoorn sahaayak hote hai
 The word plan in the stories are full of shadows and images
 asampurn vaakyon kaa prayog kai baar varnan ko kavita kii ooshmaa detaa he
 His analogies are poetic poetry
 is tarah ke lekhan ke kuch udhaaharan hai-‘‘nakshatra dikh rahe the mrit machhliyon kii aankhon kii tarah’’, surya navvivaahit tarun ofisar-sa chaar bajte hi vidaai letaa tha’’, ‘‘timi kii tarah vapuman mantri, kaale-kaale rekhamay meghon kaa oonee sweater pahane chaand’’ aadi
 a representative description of his metaphoric image can be found from the following lines of his 'dhumabh Digant' story- ‘‘shuru main uske sangeet shikshak the kuch bhunre
 The cuckoo took further responsibility after they taught him to hum
 aisa nahin tha ki koyal sirf apni-apni kook se hi apane kartavya kaa nirvaah kar rahi thim, ve us ladki ko bula le jaati thim, jangal ke ek aise ghaney ilaake main, jahaan kisi gupha ke andar hawa tarah-tarah kii dhvaniyaan utpann karti thi, jo use bula le jaati thim mridu-mridu veena-vaadan karte jharne ke kinare bhi
 The stars taught him the alphabet, Indradhanush taught him to love; The smile was taught by sunrise and sunset taught sadness
 ’’ These lines are pure poetry and its language informs the poetry of Manoj Das's early life
 is bhashaa main ek baat yah bhi dekhnaa he ki bhashaa kai jagah gambheer va shastreey he to kahin ati saral va pravahpurn bhi
 Language is used to coordinate the use of simple grammatical words with complex Sanskrit words
 manoj das kii kahani bhoomika main jo disha hamaare saamne pehle drushti gochar hoti he vah he iskaa vyangyatmak drushtikon
 Whether the story is of political background or social problem, the characters are kings, landlords or ordinary human beings, all are the characters of satire
 adhikansh kahaniyon main paristhitiyaan bhi vyangyatmak hai
 As the monkey lifts the cap, the doctor discovers the disease in the sick man
 sookhe ke dauraan prajaaon ke liye chaaval bachaane hetu jameendaar sahab keval gosht khate hai
 The zamindar's mustache will be clean, that's why Nayak Saheb Headmaster, Tehsildar are all worried
 pati-patni main samjhauta hota he ki donon main se kisi ek kii pehle mrityu ho jaye to uskaa pret duusare ko pretalok se sandesh bhejega
 The headmaster husband punishes his wife for standing on the bench for any defect
 is sab hasyakar paristhitiyon main sahaayak hote hai adbhut namawale paatr jaise: professor dhrupad, mises hyphen, bandar jhandu, ugracharan, mistar tintuli, chaakori quturi aadi
 It is not proper to prove from this that the stories of Manoj Das are only comic-oriented
 haalaanki varnan tathaa drushtikon main vyangy kaa prabhaav he, par kahaniyaan bhinn-bhinn paristhitiyon, samasyaon va paatro ko lekar likhi gayi hai
 In many stories, political leaders have fallen prey to their rebellion
 parantu in sab kahaniyon main ve pratyaksh yaa prachaar-dharmi nahin hai
 It is as if they analyze the political form by staying at a particular distance
 kuch or kahaniyaan swatantrata ke purv swatantrata aandolan kii prishth-bhoomi par aadhaarit hai
 In these stories we find Zamindar, Raisahab, Raja, English officer etc
 oreisha kii graamy jivan kii tasaveer bhi unki kai kahaniyon main ubhari he
 In these stories, apart from the lifestyle of the village and countryside, the customs, poverty and pitifulness of the country are also revealed
 phir kai kahaniyaan puri tarah bhautik tathaa rahasyamay vishay vastu par aadhaarit hai
 Whatever be the theme or background of the story, the character of each story is successful and complete, and the whole story is a natural principle
 iske alaava unki kai kahaniyaan sidhe-sade feble yaa pariktha he
 'abu Purush', a long story of Manoj Das based on Niti Katha is a classic example of this kind of story- kisi bhartiya mi
 sharma ke sir kaa abu kramshah uske vyavsaay main aarthik siddhi va raajnneetik vijay kaa ek vikrut saadhan ban gaya he
 TV company, editor of sports magazine, political rival Mr
 President in the presidential election
 Hyena, Vulture Top Company, etc
 have all benefited from the vast Abu of this straightforward Indian
 mi
 sharma ne kramshah anubhav kiya he ki abu, saubhaahgya kaa pratik he, isliye use na katwakar vah apane desh laut aayaa
 Here Mr
 M
 was in election with the company owner
 Sharma becomes a rival and also lives
 trishna zyaada-se-zyaada badhati jaati he
 The hope of being a minister thrives
 yahi maanon unka aakhri swapn tathaa jivan kii sarvshereshth paripurnataa he
 But the believing mother of spirituality awakens her wisdom
 guru kii krupa se abu thik ho jaataa he
 This is a reality of the Indian faith
 is ati bhautik prakriya ko chunaav ke maidan main prayog karke jeetne kaa swapn main mi
 sharma jhum uthte hai
 But the simple believing mother preaches to him - "son, never make such a mistake again
" guru kaa aashirwad tuje abu-mukt karne ke liye he
 It is not about preaching, selling and taking advantage of liberation
 ’’ The proverb of this story is finally told through the mouth of the mother - "during your liberation, i have dreamed that the whole world will probably one day be free from Abu Tantric politics and business
" ’’manoj das kii kahaniyon kii ek or visheshta yah he ki chunki kahani kaa paatr va prishth bhoomi kisi ek desh va kaal kaa he, parantu puri kahani or uskaa saar tatva samay tathaa sthaan se pare hai
 These stories can be of any country or time
 kyonki manushya kii hansee-rulaai aadim pravritiyaan, irshyaa-dwesh prem-sadbhaav, kisi ek desh yaa kaal ke nahin hote
 It has already been said that Manoj Das's stories begin with a dramatic miracle
 thik usee tarah unki kahaniyon ke ant main bhi hoti he ek ajeeb aakasmikta
 And between the beginning and the end there is a planned story
 isiilie unke bare main kaha gaya he: ‘‘unhen kahani-lekhak kii bajaay kahani kathak kahana zyada uchit hoga
 His statement style is ingrained in short-tempered agility, then by creating a suffix unworthy of belief in the creation of the event in the mind of the storyteller O
 The ending of Henry is characteristic of the stories of Manoj Das
 ’’ The last thing that can be said about Manoj Das is that he has been active in writing so far, starting story writing forty years ago
 unka saahitiyik yogadan bahut bahumoolya he or oriya sahitya unase or bhi anek kritiyon kii aapeksha rakhata he
 Manoj Das has said a lot about his writing in several interviews
 saakshatkaaron ke ansh is sangrah ke ant main diye gayi hai
 From this one can get some idea of manojdas's bestial mind

 haridwar kaa arth "hari kaa dwaar" hota he
 According to later Hindu religious stories, Haridwar is the place where a few drops of nectar accidentally fell from the pitcher when Dhanvantari was carrying the pit after the churning of the sea
 dhyatavya he ki kumbh yaa mahakumbh se sambaddh katha kaa ullekh kisi puraana main nahin he
 It has been mentioned in the projected form only
 atah katha kaa rup bhi bhinn-bhinn rahaa he
 It is believed that drops of nectar fell at four places
 ve sthaan hai:- ujjain, haridwar, nasik or prayag
 Mahakumbh is held every 12 years in turn at these four places
 ek sthaan ke mahakumbh se teen varshon ke baad duusare sthaan par mahakumbh kaa aayojan hota he
 In this way, in the twelfth year a cycle is completed and then the time of Mahakumbh comes in the first place
 puri duniya se karodon tirthayatri, bhaktajan or paryatak yahaan is samaaroh ko manaane ke liye ekatrit hote hai or ganga nadi ke tat par shaastra vidhi se snaan ityadi karte hai

 haridwar tirth ke rup main bahut pracheen tirth he parantu nagar ke rup main yah bahut pracheen nahin he
 The name Haridwar has also become prevalent in the later mythological period
 mahabharat main ise keval 'gangadwar' hi kaha gaya he
 In the Puranas, it is described as Gangadwar, Mayakshetra, Mayatirtha, Saptasrota and Kubjamrak
 pracheen kaal main kapilmuni ke naam par ise 'kapila' bhi kaha jaataa tha
 It is said that Kapil Muni had Tapovan here
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar bhageerath ne, jo suryavanshi raja sagar ke praputra the, gangaji ko satyuga main varshon kii tapasya ke pashchaat apane 60,000 purvajon ke uddhaar or kapil rishi ke shaap se mukt karne ke liye ke liye prithvi par laayaa
 Probably the first use of the name 'haridwar' is in Padmapurana
 padmapurana ke uttar khand main ganga-avataran ke uparokt prasang main haridwar kii atyadhik prashansa karte hue uske sarvshereshth tirth hone kii baat kahi gayi he:- Haridware Yada Yata Vishnupodaki Tada tadev tirthan pravaran devanampi durlaum

 Those who take a bath in that pilgrimage and especially visit Srihari, revolve around them, they are not part of the misery
 vah samast tirthon main shreshth or dharm, arth, kaam, moksh rup chaaron purusharth pradaan karne vaala he
 Where the atomic delightful and serene Ganga ji flows continuously, a man listening to the virtuous best recitation of Haridwar attains the eternal fruit of sacrificing millennia Godan and Ashwamedha
 mahabharat ke vanaparv main devarshi naarad 'bhishma-pulasthya samvaad' ke rup main yudhisthir ko bharatvarsh ke tirth sthalon ke bare main bataate he jahaan par gangadwar arthath haridwar or kankhal ke tirthon kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 In the Mahabharata, Gangadwar is implicitly described as Swargadwar: - swargdwaren yat tulyan gangadwaran na sanshayah
 Contains the coronation of the Koravith Kotitirthe
 
 pundarikamvapnoti Kul Chaiv Samudrat ushyaikan rajaneen tatra gosahastrafalan labhet

 Staying there for one night gives you the fruits of thousands of cow sheds
 saptagang, trigang, or shakravart tirth main vidhipurvak devataaon tathaa pitaron kaa tarpan karne vaala manushya punya lok main pratishthit hota he
 Subsequently, a person who fasted for three nights after bathing in Kankhal gets the fruits of Ashwamedha Yagya and goes to heaven
 yah sthaan bada ramnik he or yahan kii ganga hinduon dwaara bahut pavitra maani jaati he
 In some of the major Puranas, the greatest glory of Ganga has been told in Haridwar, Prayag and Gangasagar: - sarvatra sulabha ganga trishu sthaneshu durlabha
 Gangadvara Prayage Ch Gangasagarasangame
 tatra snatva divan yanti ye mritastepunarbhavah
 
 arthath ganga sarvatra to sulabh he parantu gangadwar prayag or gangasagar-sangam main durlabh maani gayi he
 Taking a bath in these places, humans go to heaven and the people who renounce their bodies do not get reborn, that is, they become free
 huentsang bhi saatvin shatabdi main haridwar aayaa tha or iskaa varnan usne 'monu-lo' naam se kiya he
 Monyu-lo is considered a modern Mayapuri village, which is near Haridwar
 pracheen kilon or mandiron ke anek khandhar yahan vidyaman hai
 Some of the oldest residential evidences found near 'har ki Paidi' in Haridwar are the cultivation sites, caves and Chitfoot monasteries of some Mahatmas

 unke sthaan par ghat or platform vistrut kar banaaye gayi hai
 In this way, the process of city-building in Haridwar started about three and a half years ago; But it is a very ancient place as a pilgrimage
 pehle yahan par pande-purohit dinabhar yatriyon ko tirthon main puja or karmkand ityadi karaate the athwa swayan puja-anushthan ityadi karte the tathaa suraj chhipane se purv hi vahaan se laut kar apane-apane awaason ko chale jate the
 Their residences were in the nearby towns of Kankhal, Jwalapur etc
 yahan kaa prasiddh sthaan 'har kii padi' he jahaan ganga kaa mandir bhi he
 Millions of travelers bathe at the foot of the har and the holy Ganges water here is carried by travelers to almost all places of the country

 prakrutipremiyon ke liye haridwar swarg jaisaa sundar he
 Haridwar presents a polymorphism of Indian culture and civilization
 yah chaar dham yatra ke liye pravesh dwaar bhi he 
 Therefore, followers of Lord Shiva and followers of Lord Vishnu call it in the name of Hardwar and Haridwar respectively - the doorway to Har ie Shiva and Hari means Vishnu
 shahari vikaas mantralay dwaara 434 shaharon main swatchta ko lekar hue surveykshan main haridwar 244 wein number par rahaa
 Since ancient times, the special glory of five pilgrimages has been told in Haridwar: - gangadware kushavarte bilvake nilparvate
 And Kankhale Shatutva Dhootapapama Div Vrajet
 
 That is, a man who is sinless after bathing in Gangadwar, Kushavarta, Bilvak Tirtha, Neel Parvat and Kankhal goes to heaven
 inamen se haridwar ke dakshin main kankhal tirth vidyaman he, pashchim disha main bilvakeshwar yaa kotitirth he, purv main nileshwar mahadev tathaa nil parvat par hi suprasiddh chandidevi,anjanadevi aadi ke mandir hai tathaa pashchimottar disha main saptagang pradesh yaa sapt sarovar he
 Apart from these places, Haridwar also has many famous scenic spots
 sarvaadhik darshneey or mahatvapurn to yahan ganga kii dhara hi he
 The stream of Ganga near 'har ki Paadi' is an artificially drawn stream from the mainstream and even a small stream from that stream has been taken out to the Brahm Kund

 The actual mainstream Ganges flows near the Nile Mountains
 'har kii padi' se chandi devi mandir kii ore jate hue laltaro pul se aage badhane par ganga kii yah vaastavik mukhya dhara apni prakritik chata ke saath drashtavy he
 The myriad pieces of stones broken by the mountain in the flood are visible here

 Bathing in Niladhara, there is great significance to see Nileshwar Mahadev on the mountain
 'padi' kaa arth hota he 'seedhi'
 It is said that King Vikramaditya's brother Bhartrihari got immortal position here by doing penance here
 bhartruhari kii smriti main raja vikramaditya ne pehle pahal yah kund tathaa padiyaan banavaayi thim
 His name 'hari ki Paidi' got this reason
 yahi 'hari kii padi' bolchaal main 'har kii paudi' ho gaya he
 'har ki Pauri' is the main place of Haridwar
 mukhyatah yaheen snaan karne ke liye log aate hai
 According to another popular belief, it is said that Lord Vishnu came here on earth

 Despite being true, this fact may surprise many people that ancient India was far ahead of many countries of the rest of the world in terms of industrial development
 ramayana or mahabharat kaal se pehle hi bhartiya vyapaarik sanghathan na keval dur-deshon tak vyapaar karte the, balki ve aarthikrup se itane majboot evam saamaajik rup se itane sakasham sangathit or shaktishaalee the ki unki upeksha kar paanaa tatkaaleen rajdhyakshon ke liye bhi asambhav tha
 According to a mention in the Ramayana, when Rama returns to Ayodhya after deducting fourteen years of exile, there are also category heads among the people who came to welcome him
 pracheen granthon main is tathy kaa bhi anek sthanon ullekh hua he ki un dinon vyaktigat swaamitv vaali nijee or paariwarik vyavsaayon ke atirikt tatkaaleen bharat main kai prakaar ke audyogic evam vyavsaayik sanghathan chaalu avasthaa main the, jinka vyapaar doordaraj ke anek deshon tak vistrut tha

 On important occasions, the emperor consulted the rank-head
 un sanghathanon ko unke vyapaar-kshetra evam kaaryastylee ke aadhaar par anek naamon se pukaara jaataa tha
 There were many names like gana, pugh, paani, vratya, sangha, nigam or nagam, rani, of which category was the most prevalent noun
 ye sabhi paraspar sahyogadhaarit sanghathan the, jinhen unki kaaryastylee evam vyapaar ke aadhaar par alag-alag naamon se pukaara jaataa tha
 The economics of ancient society has also been analyzed in Indian theology
 unamem ullikhit he ki haath se kaam karne vaale shilpkaar, vyavsaay chalaane vaali jatiyaan vyavasthit thim
 He demonstrated his prudence by adopting organized trade for collective interests
 isi kaaran ve aarthik evam saamaajik rup se kaaphi samrudh bhi thim
 Acharya Pandurang Vaman Kane has described the characteristics of different business organizations of that time differently
 katyayan ne shreni, pug, gana, vraat, nigam tathaa sangh aadi ko varg athwa samooh mana he
 1 But Acharya Kane did not agree with his interpretation
 unke anusaar ye sabhi shabd puraane hai
 Even in Vedic literature these have been used
 yadhyapi vahaan unka saamaanya arth dal athwa varg hi he
 2 Similarly, in the Kaushitakibrahman Upanishad, Pugh is given the Rudra simile
 3 aapstamb dharmasutra main sangh ko paribhaashit karte hue uski kaarividhi or bhavishya ko dekhne hue, anya sanghathanon ke sandarbh main uske antar ko samajha ja saktaa he
 4 paninikaal tak sangh, vraat, gana, pug, nigam aadi naamon ke vishisht arth dhvanit hone lage the
 He has discussed in detail the etymology of the above names considered synonymous or different forms of the category
 is tathy kaa ullekh ham pehle hi kar chuke hai ki shreniyon kii pahunch keval aarthik kaaryakalapon tak hi simit nahin thim, balki unki vyapti dharmik, raajnneeti or saamaajik sabhi kshetron main thi
 Therefore, looking at the field, it was natural for him to be called by various addresses
 duusari ore yah bhi sach he ki pug, vratya, nigam, shreni ityadi vibhinn naamon se pukaare jane ke baavjood sahyogadhaarit sanghathanon ke bich unke kaaryakalapon athwa shrenidharm ke aadhaar par koi spasht simarekha nahin thi
 In other words, these names were adopted according to the style and scope of work under specific circumstances, but there was a lack of clear division of work between them
 sanghathan ke vibhinn naamon ke kaaran unke bich anaupchaarik-se bhed evam unase dhvanit hone prachlit arth ko aage ke anuchhedon main spasht karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he- The name has been popular since ancient times as a union or alternative government
 isamen aantarik loktantr kii bhaavana pradhan hoti thi
 Panini, in his great language, considered people who had no specific occupation, who could adopt any kind of business for their immediate interests
 duusare shabdon main unhen kai vyavsaayon kaa kaarysadhak gyaan hota tha
 And they could choose any of their occupations according to time and utility
 vratya praayah apane shaareerik bal se hi apni jeevika chalaate the
 They were skilled craftsmen from various castes and considered it necessary to stay united among themselves for the protection of their economic interests
 katyayan ne vratyon ko vicitra astradhari sainikon kaa jhund mana he
 Some different Vikramaditya Khanna, quoting Kiran Kumar Thaplyal and Majumdar, living in the same enclave, striving for economic interests, have termed the group as vratya and pooja
 unke anusaar—‘vratya evam pug ek hi nagar athwa gaanv ke nivaasiyon ke saamanytah ek hi vyavsaay main lage, samaan aarthik hiton ke liye gathit samooh the
 '5 It is clear that the Vratyas were like-minded people, who had knowledge of multiple occupations
 apane paramparaagat udhyam main anukool avasar na dekh ve sahyogi sanghathan ke gathan kii ore unmukh hote the
 Their organizations were more democratic and liberal
 acharya kane ne apane vrihad granth ‘dharamshastra kaa itihaas’ main ullekh kiya he ki vratya kii bhaanti pug bhi vibhinn jatiyon se aae hue log the
 They could work on anything from mistry to laborer, if required
 kashika ke anusaar ve dhanalolup or kaami the, jinka koi sthir vyavsaay nahin tha
 Katyayan has accepted Pugh as a community of traders
 kautilya ne bhi apane arthshaastra main ek sthaan par sainikon evam shramikon main antar darshaya gaya he
 According to him, the categories of soldiers of Saurashtra and Kamboj state were divided into different classes
 unamem se kuch aayudh ke sahare apni aajeevika chalaane vaali thim, to kuch kii aajeevika kaa madhyam krishi tha—pug ek sthaan kii vibhinn jatiyon evam vibhinn vyavsaay vaale logon kaa samudaay he or shreni vibhinn jatiyon ke logon kaa samudaay he—jaise helabukon, tambulikon, kuvindon evam charmkaaron kii shreniyan
 chaahmaan vigraharaj ke prastarlekh main helabukon ko prayek ghode ke liye ek dramm dene kaa vrittant miltaa he
 '6 Pug was probably an organization of persons whose ancestral business was war or service; That is, people who were not authorized to do commercial work in terms of division of varna
 krishak evam sainik jatiyon ke log apane vyavsaay se hataash hokar, parivartan athwa apekshaakrit adhik aarthik laabh ke liye sanghathan kaa nirmaan karte the
 There is also a considerable possibility that in the absence of commercial experience and lack of knowledge of craftsmanship, the organization of the Shudravas and the people who were expelled from the army were considered to be Pooj
 Such people preferred the formation of war or unprofessional categories
 is tarah pug evam vratya kahe jane vaale sanghathanon main saidhantik drushti se koi khaas antar nahin tha
 The Sangh has generally been considered synonymous with the organization of specific people
 pracheen bharat main ganatantric satta ke dhruvon ko sangh ke naam se pukaarane kii parampara rahi he
 The members of the unions were selected on the basis of majority
 tathaapi vah simit ganatantr tha
 Their members were often associated with the upper-caste castes in the Varna system, which formed the organization to achieve their economic, political and religious interests
 lagbhag yahi aashay gana kaa bhi rahaa he
 Initially, there was no theoretical split between these two
 In due course, distinction between gana and sangha was definitely being made
 lekin gana ko ekvachan ke rup main bhi sweekaara jaataa rahaa he, jabaki sangh kii sangya vivekwan logon ke samooh ke liye surakshit rahi he, jo apane nirnay siddhanthata aamasahmati ke aadhaar par lete hon
 visheshkar bauddhadharm ke abhyudhya ke pashchaat brahmanon ne swayan ko unase alag dikhaane ke liye, unke sanghathanon ko sangh kahana prarambh kar diya tha
 Manu has used the Sangh for organized society
 jabaki katyayan ke anusaar sangh baudhon tathaa jainon kaa samaaj he
 Dr
 Rameshchandra Mazumdar and Dr
 Kiran Kumar Thaplyal, both have recommended this view
 in donon ke hawaale se vikramaditya khanna likhte hai ki—‘sangh kaa sambodhan saamanytah raajnneetik sanghathanon ke liye tha
 Although sometimes the term was also used for organizations dedicated to the development of educational and religious activities, especially groups of Buddhist monks
 ’7 is vargeekaran se sangh kii aarthik visheshtaon kaa koi bodh nahin hota
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki baudhon ke dharmik, saamaajik evam raajnneetik hiton ke liye gathit samoohon ko sangh kii sangya di jaati ho
 lekin lokapanrapara main vyapaariyon ke samoohon ko bhi sangh kehane kaa chalan tha
 In ancient Indian Venmay, the word Gana is mentioned as Anakarthi
 gana kaa saamaanya abhipraay susanskrit naagarik se bhi he
 To maintain the socio-political system in villages and towns, the specific persons of the society who were assigned this responsibility were called 'gana'
 kai baar dharmik evam raajnneetik uddeshyon ke liye manonith vyakti bhi ‘gana’ kii sangya se vibhooshit kar die jate the
 Later, this noun was also used for organizations formed for economic purposes
 In the Vasistha Dharmasutra, 'gana' is mentioned as an organized society
 kuch isi prakaar kaa arth manu ne bhi bataaya he; yani puraa samaaj gana athwa gansamooh he
 Katyayan has named the organization of Brahmins as Gana, making it even more special by making it based on varna-division
 mitakshra ke anusaar gana vyapaariyon ke samooh the, jinka pramukh vyavsaay helabuk arthath ghode kaa vyavsaay karnaa tha
 Vikramaditya Khanna, considering Gana as a religious and political organization, has placed it before the Sangh
 da
 majumdaar kaa sandarbh dete hue ve likhte hai ki—‘prarambh main gana kaa abhipraay vyapaariyon ke samooh se tha, magar kalantar main unhen raajnneetik evam dharmik sanghathan ke rup main bhi manyata milane lagi
’8 saamaanya naagariktabodh kii prastuti ke liye bhi gana kaa upyog aam nagarikon ke liye maanya rahaa he
 Republic is an etymology of the same word
 yahi arth sahasrabdiyon tak vidwaanon ko maanya rahaa he
 But it is also true that nouns and their contexts change over time
 kai baar swaarthee log bhi shabdon ko unke mul sandarbhon se katkar manamaani vyakhyaayein karte rahete hai
 It appears that the use of Gana was initially safe for citizens and civic groups
 baad main yahi sangya vyapaaree-samoohon ko bhi di jane lagi
 lekin kalantar main, buddha dharm ke udbhav ke baad brahmanon ne unke sanghathanon ko sangh tathaa apane samoohon ko gana kahana aarambh kar diya tha
 The word Nigam or Nigam is the English synonym Corporation, which refers to a responsible organization that is formed to look after and maintain specific services
 naagarik sevaaon main saamaajik, aarthik evam raajnneetik aadi sabhi sevaayen sammilit hai
 Corporations were also commercial organizations like category and poog
 negam ko paribhaashit karne kaa kaary katyayan dwaara kiya gaya
 According to him, a corporation means a group of citizens of the same city
 vaidic sahitya main shreni, pug athwa negam jaise shabd anek sthanon par aae hai, jahaan unka saamaanya arth dal athwa sanghathan se hi he
 However, the opinion of Kiran Kumar Thaplyal differs somewhat from this
 unke anusaar nigam athwa negam kaa kaaryakshetra vistrut hota tha, yahaan tak ki nagareey simaaon se pare bhi
 negam ke saapeksh shreni ek choti ikai thi or ek negam kai shreniyon par anushaasan kar saktaa tha
 We can also consider corporate as a synonym for Anglo-word federation
 unke anusaar—‘nigam ko praayah gild athwa nagar ke samatuly mana jaataa he
 They were larger than the category
 guptkaal ke aasapaas nigam kaa kisi ek parikshetra main karyrat shreniyon par niyantran hota tha
 '9 Mitra Mishra defines the corporation in' Veeramitrodaya ', saying that, Paur Vaniks are called Nigam
 10 vaidhanik drushti se negam aadhunik jayant stock company ke anuroop hote the
 Dr
 The views of Satyaketu Vidyalankar are also visible - 'the group formed by the business people, organized in the manner of a giant stock company, was called the' Sustainable Restoration '
 par shilpiyon kii shreniyon ke samaan vyapaariyon ke samooh bhi vidyaman the, jinhen ‘nigam’ kaha jaataa tha
 


 Just as the artisans organized laws in the category and made laws on the subjects related to them, and governed the craft, similarly organized traders in the corporation made arrangements regarding their business
 kyonki puron main pradhanthya vyapaariyon kaa hi nivas hota he or vahaan ve pramukh sthaan rakhte the, atah swaabhaavik rup se paur sanstha kaa vikaas nigam ko adhar banaakar hi hua
 11 District and Nigam have been used as synonyms in Buddhist literature
 12 nigam ke pradhan yaa mukhiya ko ‘shreshthi’ kaha jaataa tha
 According to 'mahabagga', when the merchants, distressed by the majesty of the nobility of the Rajgriha, thought of treating him with royalty, they reached the court of Emperor Bimbasar for his permission
 vahaan jaakar unhone prarthana kii ki— ‘he dev! is shreshthi ne aapke or nigam ke prati bahut upkaar kiya he
 '13 It is clear that the forestry organized as a corporation was called 'nigam'
 ye vyapaarik sanghathan adhikaar-sampann hote the, jo kshetreey shreniyon par anushaasan banaae rakhkar vikaas ke liye bahuaiami str par kaam karte the
 Often merchants, craftsmen, rank-heads living in the same enclave organized to spread trade outside their enclaves
 choti-choti shreniyan bhi, apane aarthik hiton kii suraksha evam vyavsaayik spardhaa main bane rahane ke liye, nigam ke rup main ekajute ho jaati thim
 The corporation can be understood more deeply by quoting Vikramaditya Khanna - 'usually the organization of merchants, artisans and persons skilled in technical work, even the soldiers skilled in warfare, was identified as a corporation or a category
 

inamen se shreni, nigam tathaa pani apane samaaj ke vikaas ke liye aarthik gatividhiyon main adhik lipt rahete the
 '14 In Yajnavalkya Smriti the corporation is kept parallel to heresy and category
 yajyavlky ke anusaar pashand dharmik sampradaayon ke sanghathan the
 According to Yajnavalkya - 'category-nigam-heresy and Gana have only one method of organization
 ’15 is vishleshan ke aadhaar par nigam ko aadhunik europea gild athwa vibhinn shreniyon kii federation ke rup main darj kiya ja saktaa he
 Pan is considered synonymous with currency
 pan athwa pani kaa aashay bhi saamanytah aise sanghathanon se tha, jo dhanarjan ke liye vyapaar ko apanaate the
 Whose goal was to work for the economic development of its members
 vikramaditya khanna ne pani ko shreni evam negam ke samakaksh rakhte hue aisa samooh mana he jiskaa uddeshy apane sadasyon kaa aarthik utthan tha
 According to him- 'papani is commonly known as a group of merchants, craftsmen who used to travel continuously from place to place as convoys for the sale of their goods
 ’16 duusare shabdon main pani vyapaariyon ke kafile the, jo apane vyapaar ke silsile main desh-deshaantar kii yatra karte rahete the
 Technically, there was not much difference between them and other forms of the category
 unki pahchaan aksar ek-duusare main ghulmil jaati he
 In India, the term category has been used for allied business economic organizations even eight hundred years before Christ
 The term has been so prevalent for mutual aid organizations that the rules for organizing and granting the status of legitimacy have also been used
 This address was said to be for organizations working in the field of organized trade and production 1000 AD; That is, until the establishment of the Muslim empire, the people kept on speaking
 Although the nouns for these organizations like poog, nagam, vratya, paani, gana etc
 have been in existence since ancient times, scholars have also tried to clarify the theoretical differences between them, however, the category of such organizations was most prevalent
 
 Even today it is known as a synonym for guild
 dhyatavya he ki gild shreni ke samandharma europea sanghathan hai
 However, in the Indian peninsula, the term category was widely used
 lagbhag sabhi prakaar ke vyapaarik, udhyami or raajnneetik sanghathanon, naagarik seva pradaan karne vaale nikaayon ko shreni ke naam se pahachaanaa jaataa tha
 As far as ancient references are concerned, the Vishnudharmasutra mentions the category as organized society, while Mitakshara considers the category to be a community of merchants of betel leaves
 17 yajyavlky ne shreni ko vibhinn jatiyon ke logon kaa sanghathan mana he, jo kisi samaan aarthik-vyapaarik uddeshy ke liye sangathit hote hai
 However, it is true that the categories were organized groups of traders who had their own identity
 vidwaanon dwaara uske bare main alag-alag vyakhya, unke anubhav or bhugolic paristhitiyon ke kaaran bhi sambhav he
 It is noteworthy that the giving of different names to the business organizations was in the view of certain differences and convenience
 kisi bhi vyakti athwa samooh ko apane hiton kii suraksha ke anusaar kisi bhi prakaar ke vyavsaay ko apnaane kii chhot thi
 However, there were disruptions to this rule in many places
 vyavastha ke lihaaj se shreniyon ko unke liye tay vyavsaay main kaam karne kii anumati praapt thi
 'yajnavalkya has asked to punish such clans, castes, and castes, who are repulsed by their conduct
 ’18 naarad smriti main bhi shreni, negam, pug evam gana kaa zikr karte hue unke paramparanuroop kaaryon kii vyakhya kii gai he
 According to the business of these organizations, there was also a difference in their structure and social status
 yajyavlky ne likhaa he ki pugon evam shreniyon ko apane jhagadon kaa anveshan karne, unhen sulajhane kaa puraa adhikaar he
 He considered Puga to be in the highest position by category
 mitakshra ne bhi yajyavlky kaa samarthan karte hue shreni or pug ke bich pug kii ucchtam sthiti ko hi manyata di he
 According to Mitakshara - 'puga is a community of people of different castes and different occupations in one place and the category is a community of people of different castes - such as categories of helabukas, tambulikas, kuvindas and tanners
 In the inscription of Chahamana Vigraharaj, 'haravikas' account of giving a dhamma of each horse
 nasik abhilekh sankhya 15 main likhaa he ki abheer raja ishvarsen ke shasankaal main 1000 karshapan kumhaaron ke samudaay main, 500 karshapan tailiyon kii shreni main, 2000 karshapan pani denevaalon kii shreni main sthir sampatti ke rup main jamaa kiye gaye, jisase ki unke byaaj se rogi bhikshuon kii dawa kii ja sake
 nasik ke nauven evam barahawein shilalekhon main julahon kii shreni kaa bhi ullekh he
 There has been talk of depositing money in the categories of Brahmashilavals and Bronzemen of Mathura during the reign of Huvishka
 skandagupt ke indore tamrapatr main telliyon kii ek shreni kaa ullekh he
 It is clear from all this that in the centuries around Christ, communities of certain castes, such as woodcutters, oilmen, Tamolis, weavers, etc
, were organized and organized in such a way that people freely deposited thousands of rupees in them with the idea that interest from them - As money will continue to be received for charity
 '19 It is clear that in ancient India, categories were not only the medium of organized trade, but they were also modern finance
 They also behaved like organizations
 log apana vyaktigat dhan bhi munaafe yaa laabh kii ichha ke saath unke paas jamaa kar sakate the
 The rulers of that time also had full confidence in the financial capabilities of the categories
 yahaan tak ki rajya ke dayitvon ko puraa karne ke liye bhi shreniyon main dhan nivesh kiya jaataa tha
 a second-century document from Mathura mentions the submission of 550 coins of silver with each of the two categories of weavers, to feed the Brahmins and the poor with interest derived from it
 The rate of interest was very suitable, very favorable to the current rates
 professor kiran kumaar thaplyaal ke anusaar nasik abhilekh main julahon ko do hajaar karshapan ek rupaya saikadaa pratimah byaaj kii dar se pradaan kiye gaye the, taaki us dhan se bhikshuon ke liye bhojan, vastra aadi kaa prabandh kiya ja saken
 isi prakaar ek anya dastavej main bhikshuon ko jalpan karaane ke liye ek hajaar karshapan 0
75 rupaya pratimah ke byaaj par julahon kii ek or shreni ko die jane kaa bhi ullekh he
 Similarly, an article by Gupta Emperor Skandagupta mentions lending of some money to Indrapur Nivasini Tailies category, so that the interest paid from it will continue to be spent for the lamps of the Sun Temple
 These quotations prove that even the big states of that time kept trying to take advantage of the financial status and goodwill of the categories to fulfill their social welfare schemes- 'these categories used to act as a bank and They were considered to be so durable and enduring that even the king or the king himself used to keep renewable funds with them
 dhan ko jamaa karne kii baat ko nigam-sabha ke sammukh bhi sunaaya jaataa tha
 20 Those trade organizations formed on the basis of collective consent and the spirit of well-being had wide rights
 kintu yah aadhikarita tabhi tak maanya thi, jab tak ki samooh apane or rajya ke hit main kalyaan ke kaaryakramon kaa sampadan karen
 unhen kisi prakaar kaa rashtravirohi athwa janvirohi kaary karne kii anumati nahin thi
 The king had the scriptural right to control such groups
 kautilya ne apane arthshaastra main in adhikaron kii spasht vyakhya kii he
 As it is, the tradition of controlling and restraining economic achievements by policy, dignity and social purity has been in Indian society since time immemorial, which has received an honored place in almost all scriptures
 bhartiya parampara main arthniti vishyak ek siddhant he, uske anusaar— ‘jis manushya kaa aarthik jivan shuddh he—vah swayan bhi shuddh he
 21 It simply means that for moral purity a person must take care of the sanctity of his economic life
 bina aarthik jivan main pavitrataa laae saamaajik jivan main shuddhta sambhav nahin he
 While indirectly, this principle accepts the importance of meaning in human life, it continues to moderate the path of its attainment
 aarthik jivan main pavitrataa or naitik maryaadaaon par jor, ye bhavanaaen bhartiya samaaj main maujuud tatkaaleen loconmukhi vyavasthaaon kii ore sanket karti hai
 It is clear that in those days, cooperativeness may not have existed in Indian society as we see it today, but that theory and emotional form is very close to the spirit of cooperative Indian thinking tradition
 yahan dhyaan rakhana hoga ki pracheen samaaj main jansadharan shaikshik rup main bhale hi bahut adhik unnat na hon—bade-bade shastron kaa adhyayan-manan karne main bhi ve bhale hi asamarth rahete hon, kintu maanav sabhyataa ke prayek kalkhand vyaavhaarik gyaan kii unamem prachurtaa hi rahi he
 Even in the early stages of civilization, almost all those systems were present in Indian society, which are considered to be the essentials of social welfare

 benami lenden adhinium Act) bhartiya sansad dwaara paarit ek adhinium he jo benami lenden kaa nishedh karata he
 It was first passed in 1988 and amended in 2016
 sanshodhit kanoon 01 navambar, 2016 se lagu ho gaya
 The amended bill has the right to seize and seal benami properties
 saath hi, jurmaane ke saath kaid kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 This is another step towards ending the growing problem of black money in India
 mul adhinium main benami lenden karne par teen saal kii jail or jurmaana yaa donon kaa praavdhaan tha
 Under the amended law, the punishment period has been increased to seven years
 jo log jaanboojhkar galat soochna dete hai un par sampatti ke bazaar mulya kaa 10 pratishat tak jurmaana bhi dena pad saktaa he
 The new law has been introduced to examine black money in domestic black money, especially in the real estate sector
 benami sampatti vah he jisaki keemat kisi or ne chukaai ho kintu naam kisi duusare vyakti kaa ho
 This property is purchased in the name of wife, children or a relative
 jiske naam par aisi sampatti kharidi gai hoti he, use 'benamdaar' kaha jaataa he
 Anonymous property can be in the form of movable or immovable property or financial documents
 kuch log apane kaale dhan ko aisi sampatti main nivesh karte hai jo unke khud ke naam par naa hokar kisi or ke naam hoti he
 Such people buy property in the name of their servant, wife and children, friends or other family members
 aamtaur par aise log benami sampatti rakhte hai jinaki aamadani kaa vartmaan strot swaamitv vaali sampatti kharidne ke lihaaj se aparyaapt hota he
 It can also be joint property with sisters, brothers or relatives whose amount is paid from declared sources of income
 isamen sampatti ke evaj main bhugtan karne vaale ke naam se koi vaid dastavej nahin hota he
 In such cases both parties involved in benami transactions can be held responsible
 agar kisi ne apane bacchon yaa patni ke naam sampatti kharidi he lekin use apane iskar ritern main nahin dikhaaya to use benami sampatti mana jaayegaa
 If the government suspects a property, it can inquire with the owner of that property and send a notice to it and ask for all the documents of the property which the owner will have to show within 90 days
 agar jaanch main kuch gadabadi paayi gai to us par kadi kaarywahi ho sakati he
 Under this new law, the benami transaction has a jail term of 3 to 7 years and a penalty of 25% on the market price of that property
 agar koi benami sampatti kii galat soochna detaa he to us par property ke bazaar mulya kaa 10% tak jurmaana or 6 maheene se 5 saal tak kii jail kaa praavdhaan rakhaa gaya he
 Apart from these, if no one is able to prove that this property belongs to him, then that property can also be confiscated by the government

 In his essay, Shinde criticized the social inequality of caste, as well as the patriarchal views of other activists, who considered caste to be the main form of protest in Hindu society
 susi tharu or ke lalita ke anusaar, "


 bhakthi kaal kii kavita ke baad stri-purush tulana shaayad pehali purna or prachlit nariwadi tark hai
 But Tarabai's work is also important because at a time when both intellectuals and activists were primarily concerned with the life of a Hindu widow and the difficulties of easily recognizing atrocities on women, Tarabai Shinde, apparently working in isolation, Patriarchal was able to broaden the scope of analysis by incorporating the conceptual framework of society

 After this, the development of modern Aryan languages of North India started in Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, etc
, which continues till today

 Sixth century BC of different languages with many characteristics of the above types of Sanskrit
 Can it be possible to generate in the same way? Apart from this, many such words are found in Prakrit which are lacking in Sanskrit, but they are present in Vedic language
 praakrit kii anek pravritiyon ko liye hue bahut se shabd vedon main paae jate hai, jo sanskrit vyakaran ke anukool nahin hai
 One of the views of many Western scholars on this problem is that when the Aryabhasha became prevalent in Bharatvarsha, the non-aryans could not pronounce and use it as pure as the Aryans; Therefore, according to his personal pronunciation and language style, he started speaking it and his contact also affected Aryo
 isi ke falswaroop praakrit bhashaa kii pravritiyon kaa vikaas hua
 In support of this view, it is also worth noting that since the Vedic period, the idols, etc
, which entered the Aryan language, were largely influenced by the non-aryan languages of that period
 kintu pracheen anarya bhashaaon kaa vishleshan kar yah siddh nahin kiya ja saktaa ki praakrit kii ukt visheshtaon kaa beej un anarya bhashaaon main vidyaman the
 That is why there is a dispute regarding this opinion
 doosraa mat yah he ki vedon kii bhashaa bolanewaale jatiyon main hi swayan dhvanyatmak bhed the, jinke kuch pramaan vedon main hi upasthit he anumaanath: vedon kii bhashaa us kaal kii roodhibaddh vedbhaasha ke kramvik se anumaanath: kai hajaar varsho main sanskrit bhashaa kaa vikaas hua, par visheshat: sushikshit purohit varg kii apni bhashaa thi, tathaa jisamen dharmik kaaryon me hi upyog kiya jaataa tha
 At the same time, Sanskrit as well as Prakrit developed from the lingua franca of the contemporary people of the oldest Vedic language, in which there were many differences according to the region
 is sambandh main yah bhi baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki bharat main aaryon kaa pravesh ek hi kaal main evam ek dhara main hua nahin kaha ja saktaa
 It is not surprising if the origin and development of Prakrit languages is related to the language discrimination of the Aryan castes coming back and forth

 aadi aryabhasha me vaidic r ke sthaan par l kaa uccharan bhi mana gaya he, jaise kulu u shroatra
 As a result of the same trend, in the German language group Wolf and Greek Plutus are found in place of Vedic tree

 The names of the gods Indra and Nasya are Indar and Nasalite inscribed in them

 The name of the deity Varuna is mentioned in the form of "uruvan", in which the tendency of the voice and the tendency of the Varnavatya are clearly visible
 ye pravritiyaan praakrit ke saamaanya lakshan hai
 Idh used in Pali is of pre-sanskrit and Vedic tradition, no one has any doubt about it
 aadi aryabhasha main e tathaa o ke hrasv rup the; i or ou kaa abhaav tha; kintu ai, au jaise mishra swar prachlit the; anunasik sparshon kaa sankoch tha; teen ooshmon main keval ekmaatr s hi tha
 These phonetic features are found primarily in the Shaurseni Prakrit, etc
 in lakshanon ke sadbhaav kaa samaadhaan samuchit rup se yahi maanakar kiya ja saktaa he ki praakrit bhashaaon main unka aagaman pracheenatam arya jatiyon kii boliyon se avichhinn parampara dwaara chalaa aayaa he
 In reality, considering Sanskrit or Vedic as the nature of Prakrit, there is no solution to the above symptoms
 tab praakrit ke vaiyakarnon ne sanskrit ko praakrit kii prakruti kyon kaha? iskaa kaaran un vyakaranon ke rache jane ke kaal or unke swaroop par dhyaan dene se spashtat: samaj me aa jaataa he
 Those grammars were written at a time when Sanskrit had more publicity and respect than Prakrit in scholasticism
 ve likhe bhi sanskrit bhashaa main gaye hai tathaa unka uddeshy bhi sanskrit naatakon main bhi prakritikta rakhane ke liye karnaa padataa tha or jinamein utkrisht saahitiyik rachanaayen bhi nirmit ho chuki thim
 Therefore, those grammars, by making Sanskrit ideal, gave a description of the characteristics which were in Prakrit and proved its significance by calling Sanskrit the nature of Prakrit
 tathaapi namisadhu ne apana yah mat spasht prakat kiya he ki prakruti kaa arth lok yaa janata he or jansadharan ko bhashaa hone se hi vah praakrit kahalaai
 The meaning of nature is very ancient and Kalidas has also used it in the meaning of folk
 prakriton kii is ati pracheen parampara ke prakaash main in bhashaaon ko vaidic or sanskrit kii apeksha uttarkalin va madhyayugin kehane kaa auchity bhi vichaarneey ho jaataa he
 If it has any significance, then only that these languages were used in literature only after Vedic and Sanskrit

 And in his literary works, Sanskrit has a big influence in terms of words and style
 bhashaa jab tak boli ke rup main rahati he, usamen desh or kaal kii apeksha nirantar parivartan hote rahete hai
 According to this rule, three levels of Prakrit have been accepted relative to time - shraman mahavir or buddha ne jis bhashaa yaa bhashaaon main apane upadesh die ve praakrit ke pracheen str ke utkrisht rup rahe honge
 The language of his teachings has been called Magadhi and Ardhamagadhi respectively
 kintu vartmaan main pali kahi janevaali bhashaa ke granthon main hame magadhi kaa vah swaroop nahin miltaa jaisaa pashchaatkaaleen vaiyakarnon ne batalaaya he
 However, the form of the language found in Buddhist Tripitaka texts is accepted only in the ancient level of Prakrit

 But the use of Jn is found in place of knowledge and judgment

 These 14 testimonials reveal the ancient form of Shaurseni to that language
 uttar pradeshwarti kaalsi, jogad nachauli naamak sthanon par bhi ve hi 14 prashastiyaan utkeern hai
 In this we get an inflection of a word in place of 'L' and the subject factor of non-intransitive nouns
 tathaapi teenon ooshmon ke sthaan par sh nahin kintu s kaa astitv miltaa he
 Thus, there are no three characteristics of Magadhi Prakrit here
 atev ise magadhi kii apeksha ardhamagadhi praakrit ke teen lakshanon main se do prachur rup se praapt hote hai, kintu sakaar sambandhi teesraa lakshan nahin
 Therefore, it seems more appropriate to call it the ancient form of Ardmagadhi Prakrit than Magadhi

 They contain the ideas and teachings of the policy, religion and morality of an emperor of ancient India who not only gained political authority over all parts of this vast country, and also established cultural relations outside the country from different countries to Alexandria

 In Prakrit, the language of the character named Gorv is used instead of र
 ye lakshan use ardhamagadhi siddh kar rahe hai
 The heroines, clowns and other characters have their own places in Prakrit

 With this, this language can clearly be called ancient Shaurseni

 He considered two types of recitation - Sanskrit and Prakrit; And it is said that three types of words are prevalent in Prakrit - same, different and native

 bharat ke mat se naatak main shauraseni bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaay yaa icchaanusaar kisi bhi deshbhasha kaa
 There are seven such official languages - Magadhi, Avanti, Shaurseni, Ardhamagadhi, Wahlika and Dakshinatya
 ant:poor nivaasiyon ke liye magadhi; chet, raajputr or sethon ke liye arghamagadhi; vidushakaadi ke liye praacha; nayika evam sakhiyon ke liye ardhamagaghi; vidushakaadi ke liye praacha; nayika evam sakhiyon ke liye shauraseni se aviruddh aavanti; yoddha, naagarik tathaa juaariyon ke liye dakshinatya; tathaa udichy, khas, shabar, shaq aadi jatiyon ke liye vahlika kaa prayog karen

 According to the commentator Prithivadhar of this play, only four types of Prakrit are used in the play - Shaurseni, Avantika, Oriental and Magadhi
 prastut naatak main sutaradhar, nati, nayika vasantsena, charudatt kii brahmani stri evam shreshthi tathaa inke parichaarak paricharikaai aise 11 paatr shauraseni bolte hai

 But if the language of all these characters is analyzed, they can all be divided into two parts - Shaurseni and Maggi

 In other things, he is only a brave

 It is very brief and only 99 sutras represent Prakrit's methods

 According to Sutra 76, in the place of the first stanzas etc
 of the classes, there is a third order, viz

 sutara 77 ke anusaar kh gh ch or bha ke sthaan main hakaar kaa aadesh jaise- mukhan -- muhan, megh: -- neho, madhav: -- maahvo, vrishabh: -- vasaho
 According to Sutra 97, the third letter of k and classes is omitted beyond the vowel, such as - Kokil: - Kohli, Bhagik: - Bhoio, Raja - Raya, Nadi - Nai
 sutara 98 ke anusaar lupt vyanjan ke pare a hone par ya hota he, jaise - kakau kaayau, nanaau naaya, rajau raaya
 The last 99th sutra states that the rest of Prakrit's system should be known through polite experiments
 inase aage ke chaar sutron main apbhransh kaa lakshan, sanyukt varna se lakaar kaa lop na hona, peshachi kaa r or n ke sthaan par l or na kaa aadesh, magadhika kaa r or s ke sthaan par l or sh kaa aadesh, tathaa shauraseni kaa t ke sthaan main vikalp se d kaa aadesh batalaaya gaya he
 Linguists are of the opinion that instead of the unacceptable characters of the second level, the beginning of the darker letters began to be pronounced
 phir inaki alpatar dhwani shesh rahi or phir sarvatha lop ho gaya, tathaa mahapraan dhvaniyon ke sthaan par keval ek shuddh ooshm dhwani h avshisht rah gai
 These trends and all the Jain Prakrit are from the Yr Shruti option specified in the said Aasha grammar
 kintu pashchaatkaaleen 16veen, 17veen shatee ke praakrit vaiyakarnon ne prakriton ke nirupan main jo bhrantiyaan utpann kii hai, unke aadhaar par kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon ne jain sahitya kii prakriton ko ukt vikalpon ke sadbhaav ke kaaran jain shauraseni tathaa jain maharashtri naamon dwaara pruthak nirdisht karnaa aavashyak samajha, yah aitihaasik drushti se vaastavik nahin he
 After this Arsha Prakrit grammar, a grammar called Prakritprakash was written, which was further increased twice
 aadi ke nau pariched vararuchi krit hai
 In these, the Prakrit method, the consonant method, the conjunctive method, the narrow, the cognate, the pronoun method, the form, the object and the imputation are represented respectively
 ant main kaha gaya he ki praakrit kaa shesh swaroop sanskrit ke samajhnaa chahie
 In this grammar, the nature of the second level Prakrit is found to be completely determined
 iske anusaar madhyavarti k g ch j t d p ya or da kaa praaia: lop hota he, evam kh gh th dh or bh ke sthaan par h aadesh
 Katyayan, Bhamah, Vasantraj, Sadanand and Rampanism are the commentaries on this ancient division of Prakrit Prakash
 aage ke 10wein or 12wein parichchhedon main kramash: pashachi kaa 14 sutron main tathaa magadhi kaa 17 sutron main nirupan kiya gaya he
 The nature of these two languages is called Shaurseni
 kintu isse purv kahin bhi shaureseni kaa naam nahin aayaa
 Therefore, presumably in the view of its doers, the representation of common nature is that of the well-known shoraseni of that period
 in do parichchhedon par keval bhamah kii tikaa he or vidwaanon kaa anumaan he ki ye donon pariched unheen ke jode hue hai
 In these, the feature of Paishachi is the order of the first and second place in the middle of the word, in the middle of the third and fourth characters, in place of n, j, in place of nya, and in place of tva and in the place of Magadhi, s In place of Ksh or k in place, Hke, Hage and Ahke in place of an ego in place of K, and the causative factor is said to be at the end of the singular
 praakrit prakaash kaa antim 12 vaan pariched bahut peeche joda gaya prathit hota he
 There is no vaccine of Bhamha and others on this
 is pariched kii avasthaa badi vilakshan he
 In it, the symptoms of Shaurseni have been told, in which the nature is said to be Sanskrit
 kintu antim 32wein sutara main pun: kaha gaya haihri sheshan maharashtri vat
 But before that the word Maharashtri has not appeared in the grammar or elsewhere in the grammar
 jaan padataa he yah pariched us samay joda gaya he jab yah dharna sudrudh ho gai ki praakrit kavy kii bhashaa maharashtri hi honi chahie
 Therefore, where Prakrit is instructed, Maharashtri should be taken for granted
 yahan jo shauraseni kaa swaroop batalaaya gaya he, usee se spasht ho jaataa he ki jo swaroop yahan saamaanya praakrit kaa batalaaya gaya he, vah shauraseni kaa hi kalanusaar viksit rup he
 For example, in Shaurseni, the place of intermediate t and TH are d and d respectively, in Prakrit there is the omission of d and th
 "bh" dhaatu kaa shauraseni main "bho" hi rahata he, ki kintu praakrit main vahaan "ho" aadesh kaha gaya he
 In Shaurseni there is a gem in the form of the impotent plural, like Jalani, Vani, there only remains of Prakrit, as in Jalaine, Vaniya Shaurseni there is the Dola, Dandi and Dana, etc
, while in Prakrit it is d
 Goes, like Dola, Stalk and Dasan etc
 prakritprakash ke pashchaat praakrit tathaa uski pradeshik bhashaaon kaa sarvangpurn nirupan karanevaala, praakrit vyakaran hemchandra dwaara 12veen shatee i
 main likhaa gaya
 It has four passages, out of which about three and a half passages give a systematic description of Prakrit and the remaining about 200 sutras have given special features of Shaurseni, Magadhi, Paisachi, Chulika Paisachi and Apabhramsa languages respectively
 in bhashaaon main se pratham teen kaa swaroop to adhik vistrut rup me vahi he jo upar batalaaya ja chukaa he
 Characteristics of Chulika Paishachi It is stated here in the four sutras that instead of the third and fourth letters, the order of the first and second is there, the word is from the option, some acharyas do not change the sound of the initials, The remaining things should be known like a vampiric

 In other words, it can also be said that anaphylaxis is a state of greatly increased efficacy for external proteins occurring in humans and animals, which causes the second external needle to add the same external protein to the numbness and headaches and intoxicants
 Appears as symptoms arising from liquids

 This type of spatially rapid anaphylactic reaction was first described by Morris Arthur
 anaphilaxis ek gambheer allergy riection he jo achaanak armbh hoti he or iske kaaran mrityu ho sakati he
 Anaphylaxis in particular has many symptoms including itchy skin eruptions, throat swelling, and low blood pressure
 iske saadhaaran kaarnon main kiton dwaara kaatna, bhojan or davaayen shaamil hai
 The cause of anaphylaxis is the secretion of proteins by various types of white blood cells
 ye protein aise padaarth hai jo allergiyukt riection ko armbh kar sakate hai yaa riection ko adhik gambheer bana sakate hai
 Their secretion may be due to immune system reaction or any other reason not related to the immune system
 anaphilaxis kaa nidaan vyakti ke lakshanon or sanketon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Its primary treatment is injection of epinephrine which is sometimes given along with other medications

 Although there are many reasons for the origin of anaphylaxis, the root cause is thought to be that of Henry H
 Dale

 It has been observed that if anticoagulant antibodies of course travel, antigens are neutralized by them, and when they stabilize in the cells, they produce histamine from the antigen, causing anaphylactic reaction
 it occurs
 histamin kii utpatti se sharirgat anaichhik mansapeshiyon main sankoch, sthanik utakon main shoth, saamaanya stabdhta, twachaa par pitti kaa uchhalana, asay condu, jalan tathaa raktchaap main nunata ityadi lakshan prakat hot hai
 Other common symptoms are excessive weakness, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, and nounlessness
 ye lakshan jab mridu rup main hote hai tab kai ghante tak vidyaman rahakar dhire dhire kam hone lagate hai, parantu jab ugr rup ke hote hai to kuch hi minuton athwa secondon main ghaatak rup dhaaran kar lete hai
 Therefore, to avoid the above mentioned disorders, such drugs are consumed which have a repulsive effect, such as benadryl pyrobenzamine and other antiallergic drugs

 In humans, anaphylaxis is often seen when the blood of diphtheria, tetanus, etc
 is injected into the body by needle and this causes symptoms of apprehension, breathing, fall in blood pressure and sometimes convulsions
 raktod sambandhi beemaari main, jo tivrograhita kii apeksha manushyon main adhik hua karti hai, mukhyat: pitti, fever, sandhishlu tathaa sachikagrathiyon main sujan aadi lakshan prakat hote hai

 Nevertheless, some scholars consider hemorrhagic disease to be an acute type of anaphylaxis
 anaphilaxis main anek prakaar ke lakshan minuton yaa ghanton main utpann hote hai
 If the cause is such a substance that enters the blood stream directly in the body, then its symptoms start appearing on average within 5 to 30 minutes
 If the reason is the food that the person has eaten, then the average time is 2 hours

 It can obstruct blood flow to the heart, causing heart cells to become depleted or heartbeat too slow or too fast, or heartbeat to stop suddenly
 
 vah vyakti jinhen pehle hi hriday rog hai ve anaphilaxis ke hriday par padane vaale prabhaavon ke ucch jokhim main hai
 Heart rate is very common due to low blood pressure, 10% of people suffering from anaphylaxis may have a decrease in heart rate with low blood pressure
 vyakti raktadab main kami ke kaaran sir kaa halkaapan yaa halki behoshee anubhav kar saktaa he
 The reason for this blood pressure can be due to widening of blood veins or due to depletion of heart ventricles

 Eating is the most common motivator in children and young adults
 bujurg vayaskon main davaaiyaan or kiton dwaara kaatna or dansh ati saamaanya prerak hai
 Less common causes include physiological factors, biological factors, latex, changes in hormones, food additives, and skin medications
 vyaayaam yaa taapmaana bhi vibhinn utak koshikaon ko rasayanon sravit karne ke madhyam se jo allergic riection ko shuru karte hai or anaphilaxis ko prerit kar sakate hai
 Anaphylaxis associated with exercise is also often related to eating different types of food

 Any medication can cause anaphylaxis
 inamen β-lectom antibiotics ke baad aspirin or eneidi hai
 If a person is allergic to an NSAID, he or she can commonly use one without inducing anaphylaxis
 anaphilaxis ke anya kaarnon main chemotherapy, vaxin, protamine or jadi-bootiyon se nirmit aushadhiyaan shaamil hai kuch davaaiyaan jinamein venchomasin, marphin or eks-re pratibimb unnat karne ke liye di jane vaali davaaiyaan shaamil hai jo utakon main vibhinn koshikaon ko nasht karke unase histamine srav kaa kaaran banate hai jiske kaaran anaphilaxis hota he
 The frequency of reacting to a drug depends partly on how often that medicine is given to the person and partly how the drug works inside the body
 pencelin yaa sephalosporin se anaphilaxis keval tabhi utpann ho saktaa he jab ve sharir ke andar proteinon se sangyojan karte hai or inamen se kuch dusron kii tulana main bahut aasaani se sangyojan karte hai
 Anaphylaxis due to penicillin occurs in one in 10,000 people who have been treated since 2000
 upachaar kiye gayi 50,000 logon main se ek kii mrityu hoti he
 Anaphylaxis due to aspirin and NSADI occurs in approximately one in 50,000 individuals
 yadi kisi vyakti ko pencelin ke kaaran riection hoti he he to use sephalosporin ke kaaran riection kaa jokhim adhik hota he parantu yah jokhim 1000 vyaktiyon main ek se bhi kam hota he
 Older medicines that have been used to improve X-ray images cause a reaction in 1% of cases
 nayi, kam osmolar radiontrast agenton ke kaaran 0
04% maamalon main riection hoti he
 The bite or bite of insects such as bees and wasp / barr or kissing bug can cause anaphylaxis due to the toxin
 yadi kisi vyakti ko pehle kabhi vish ke kaaran riection hua he or iskaa asar maatr dansh / kaate jane ke sthaan se adhik vistrut rahaa he to use bhavishya main anaphilaxis kaa adhik jokhim hota he
 But more than half of the individuals who die due to anaphylaxis have not previously had extensive reactions
 atopic rogon jaise asthma, ekajima, yaa alergic nasashoth se peedit vyaktiyon main bhojan, latex or radiontrast agenton ke kaaran anaphilaxis hone kaa ucch jokhim hota he
 These people are not at high risk due to injectable drugs or rash
 anaphilaxis se peedit bacchon ke ek adhyayan se gyaat hua ki 60% bacchon main pehle atopic rogon kaa itihaas rahaa he
 90% of children who died due to anaphylaxis were suffering from asthma
 vah vyakti jinhen utakon main bahut adhik mast koshikaon ke kaaran vikaar hai yaa jo inase samrudh hai iske adhik jokhim vaale kshetra main hai
 The older the access to the agent that has caused anaphylaxis, the lower the risk of new reactions
 anaphilaxis ek gambhir alergic riection he jo achaanak armbh hota he or yah sharir kii anek pranaaliyon ko prabhavit karata he
 It is caused by the secretion of cytokines from inflammatory factors and mast cells and basophils
 unka srav visheshkar pratirakshan pranali riection ke kaaran hota he parantu in koshikaon ke kshatigrast hone ke kaaran ho saktaa he jo pratiraksha pranali se sambandhit nahin hai
 When anaphylaxis is caused by an immune response, immunoglobin e combines with an external substance that initiates an allergic reaction
 ige kaa sangyojan mast koshikaon or basophills par grahi fcεri pratirakshi sakriyata se judaa hota he
 Mast cells and basophils react by secreting inflammatory factors such as histamine
 ye kaarak bronchioli kii komal peshiyon main sankuchan paidaa karte hai, raktavahiniyon ko chaudaa kar dete hai, rakt vahikaaon se drav ke srav ko badha dete hai or hriday peshiyon kii kriya ko kam kar dete hai
 There is also an immune system that does not depend on ige, but it is not known whether it also occurs in humans
 anaphilaxis jab pratirakshi pranali kii pratikriya ke kaaran nahin hota he, to riection kaa kaaran vah agent hota he jo sidhe mast koshikaon or basophil ko nasht kar detaa he, jiske kaaran histamin or anya padaarthon kaa srav hota he jo praaia: allergic riection se jude hote hai 
 Factors that can damage these cells include contrast factors for x-rays, opioids, temperature, and vibration
 anaphilaxis rog kii pahchaan naidanik tathyon ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 When any one of the following three conditions occur within minutes / hours of exposure to an allergenic substance, it is highly likely that the person has anaphylaxis: agar keet ke dank maarane yaa dawa se kisi vyakti par vifailli pratikriya hoti he to anaphilaxis rog kii pahchaan karne main tryptes yaa histamine ke liye khun kii jaanch karnaa upyogi ho saktaa he
 However, these tests are not very useful if they are due to food or if the person's blood pressure is normal and they cannot rule out the possibility of identifying anaphylaxis disease
 anaphilaxis kii teen pramukh visheshtaayen hoti hai
 Anaphylactic shock occurs when the blood vessels in most parts of the entire body become enlarged, causing the blood pressure to fall which is at least 30% lower than a person's normal blood pressure, or 30% below the standard value
 bafesic anaphilaxis kii pahchaan tab hoti he jab iske lakshan 1-72 ghanton ke bheetar phir se dikhne lagen, bhale hi vyakti allergy karne vaale tatwon ke saath nae sampark main na aayaa ho, jinke kaaran pehali baar pratikriya hui thi
 Some studies claim that 20% of total cases of anaphylaxis are biphasic
 lakshanon kii vaapasi aam taur par 8 ghanton ke bheetar hoti he
 Treatment of the second reaction is similar to that of the original anaphylaxis
 sudo-anophlaksis yaa anophelactoid pratikriyaayein us anaphilaxis ke puraane naam hai jo allergy vaali pratikriya ke kaaran nahin balki mastul koshikaon par sidhi chot ke kaaran hota he
 The nickname used by the World Allergy Organization is "non-immune anaphylaxis"
 kuch log is baat ki sifarish karte hai ki puraane naam kaa upyog ab nahin kiya janaa chahie
 An allergy test can be helpful in determining what causes a person to have anaphylaxis
 twachaa allergy jaanch kuch nishchit khadyon or jeev-vishon ke liye uplabdh he
 Blood tests for specific disease antibodies may be useful to confirm allergies related to milk, eggs, peanuts, nuts and fish
 twachaa kii jaanchon se pencilin allergiyon kii pushti ho sakati hai lekin, anya aushadhiyon ke liye twachaa sambandhi koi jaanch nahin he
 Non-immune forms of anaphylaxis can only be identified by investigating a person's history or by exposing the person to allergens that have caused them to react in the past
 non-immune anaphilaxis ke liye twachaa yaa rakt sambandhi koi jaanch nahin he
 Sometimes anaphylaxis is difficult to distinguish separately from asthma, due to lack of oxygen, and from fear of accident
 asthma se peedit logon main aam taur par khujali yaa pet athwa aant sambandhi lakshan nahin hote hai
 When a person becomes unconscious, the skin becomes pale but, it does not have rash
 aakasmik bhay se grast vyakti kii twachaa laal ho sakati he lekin, usamen chakatte nahin hote hai
 Other conditions that may have similar symptoms include food poisoning caused by spoiled fish and infections with some parasites
 jin kaarnon se ateet main pratikriya hui ho unase parhez karnaa, anaphilaxis kii rokthaam kaa anushansit tarika he
 When this is not possible, there are also treatments that can prevent the body from reacting to any known ingredient that is allergic
 madhumakhiyon, tataiyon, lakheriyon, yelogacketon or fire ant se hone vaali allergiyon ke liye hymenoptera vishon ke dwaara immune system yani pratiraksha pranali kaa upachaar prabhavi hota he jisase 80-90% vayaskon or 98% bacchon main samvedanheenata prabhavi rahi he
 In the case of certain foods, including milk, eggs, nuts and peanuts, immune treatment from the mouth may be effective in sensitizing some people; However such treatments often cause side effects
 samvedanheenata, kai dawaaon ke liye bhi sambhav he, iske baavjood zyaadaatar logon ko keval samasya paidaa karne vaali aushadhiyon se parhez karnaa chahie
 Individuals who respond to latex would be better off avoiding foods that contain ingredients that cause an immune response in them, including avocado, bananas, and potatoes, among others
 anaphilaxis ek prakaar kii chikitsiya apaat sthiti he jisamen shwasan-maarg prabandhan, poorak oxigen, nason ke madhyam se die jane vaale taral padaarthon kii badi maatra or gahan nigaraanee jaise jivan rakshak upayon kii aavashyaktaa pad sakati he
 Epinephrine is a treatment option
 ipinefrine ke atirikt aksar antihistamins or steroid kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 When individuals are in a normal state, they should be monitored for 2 to 24 hours in the hospital to ensure that symptoms do not recur because this can happen again if the person has biphasic anaphylaxis
 ipinefrine anaphilaxis ke liye praathmik upachaar he
 There is no reason not to use it
 is baat kii sifarish kii jaati he ki jaise hi anaphilaxis kii sandigdh sthiti kii pahchaan ho, madhya agraparshvik jaangh main ipinefrine taral kaa injection diya jaae
 This injection is repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if the person does not respond better to treatment
 16 se 35% maamalon main duusari khuraaq kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 More than two doses are required in very rare cases
 twachaa ke neeche die jane vaale injection ke mukaable nason main die jane vaale injection ko praathamikta di jaati he jisamen, dawa ko atyant dhimi gati se avashoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Minor problems with epinephrine include tremors, restlessness, headaches, and numbness
 ipinefrine aise logon par prabhavi nahin hoti he jo bi-bloker lete hai
 In this situation, glucagon may be given intravenously if epinephrine is not effective
 glucagon main aisi kaary pranali he jisamen β-abhigraahak shaamil nahin hote hai
 If necessary, epinephrine can also be given intravenously using dilute liquid
 halanki, intravenus ipinefrine ko dil kii aniyamit dhadakanon or hrydayaghaton se joda gaya he
 The epinephrine auto-injector, which facilitates individuals with anaphylaxis to inject epinephrine on their own in the veins, is generally available in two doses, one 25 kg
 One for adults or children overweight and the other for children whose weight is 10 to 25 kg
 Be between ipinefrine ke atirikt antihistamine kaa upyog saamaanya rup se hota he
 They were considered to be effective on theoretical arguments, but there is little evidence that antihistamine is indeed effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis
 2007 cokeren samiksha main acchhee gunvattta vaala aisa koi bhi adhyayan nahin paaya gaya jise isaki sifarish ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 No antihistamine effects on fluid formation or spasms in the respiratory tract have been observed
 agar vyakti ko vartmaan samay main anaphilaxis ho to corticosteroidon se koi antar hone kii sambhaavna behad kam he
 It can be used in the hope that the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis is reduced but its efficacy in preventing future anaphylaxis is uncertain
 jab shwasni-aakarsh lakshanon main ipinefrine raahat nahin detaa he to saans ke madhyam se dawa lenevaale upkaran kii sahaayta se diya jane vaala salbutamol prabhavi ho saktaa he
 Methylene blue is used for individuals who do not react to other measures because it can relax the soft nerves
 jin logon ko anaphilaxis kaa khatra ho unhen “allergy ection plan” kaa paalan karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Regarding the problem of children's allergies, their parents should inform the school about it and also what should be done in an anaphylotic emergency
 ection plan main aam taur par ipinefrine auto-injectoron ke istemaal, chikitsiya alert vaale bracelate pahanane kii salaah or aisi paristhitiyon ko paidaa karne vaale prerakon se parhez ke bare main paraamarsh shaamil hota he
 Treatment is available to make the body less sensitive to an allergic reaction to the motivators causing certain conditions
 is prakaar kii therapy bhavishya main hone vaali anaphilaxis kii rokthaam kar sakati he
 Multi-year treatment for subcutaneous anesthesia was found to be effective in the case of stinging pests whereas oral anesthesia treatment is effective for many foods
 jab kaaran gyaat hon or vyakti kaa turant upachaar kiya jaae to iske thik hone kii sambhaavna bahut adhik he
 Even if the reasons are not known, if a drug is available to stop the reaction, then the person usually improves well

 An increase in anaphylaxis has been seen primarily due to foods
 iskaa khatra sabase adhik yuva logon or mahilaon ke liye he
 Currently, anaphylaxis causes 500–1,000 deaths per year in the United States, 20 deaths per year in the United Kingdom, and 15 deaths per year in Australia
 1970 ke dashak se lekar 2000 ke dashak main mrityu daron main kami ai he
 In Australia, deaths from food-borne anaphylaxis were seen primarily in women, whereas in men, the primary cause was insect bites
