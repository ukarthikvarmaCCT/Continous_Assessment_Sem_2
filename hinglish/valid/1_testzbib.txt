 is varnan se yah bhi pramanit hota he ki bhartiya itihaas ke praaia: madhyakaal tak kamboj desh ke naam kaa prachlan tha tathaa isaki seemayen bhi praaia: purvawat hi thim, kintu yah jaan padataa he ki tatpashchaat dhire-dhire is janapad kaa vilay kashmir rajya main ho jane se isaki pruthak satta kaa ant ho gaya or iske saath hi iskaa naam bhi vismriti ke gart main ja padaa
 Yet the memory of the name of Kamboj is still preserved in the names of some tribes of the neighboring region of Kafiristan, such as Kamboji, Kamose and Kamoje etc
 nepali parampara main kamboj desh ke naam se tibet kaa abhidhaan kiya jaataa rahaa he, kintu uparyukt tathyon se yah bhalee bhanti pramanit hota he ki is janapad kii sthiti pracheen bharat kii uttari pashchimi seemaa ke nikat hi rahi hogi
 This fact is also proved by his dialect, which was a branch of the Iranian language

 kuch adhikariyon kaa suzav he ki hriday gati ko dhimaa karne ke liye ek sanyukt alpha / beta bloker jaise lebetalol bhi diya janaa chahie
 But in the presence of pheochromocytoma, "pure" beta blockers such as etinolol should not be used at all, as such treatment can lead to uncontrolled alpha agonism and the subsequent risk of severe and possibly refractory hypertension
 feochromocytoma kaa marij sadaa pariman ksheen rahata he
 In other words, an untreated pheochromocytoma characterized by prolonged advanced adrenergic status results in almost complete inhibition of renin-angiotensin activity resulting in too much fluid loss in urine and thus reduced blood volume
 isliye jab feochromocytoma ko nikaal diya jaataa he jisase catacolamin ke sanchaalan kaa pramukh strot hat jaataa he to ek aisi sthiti utpann hoti he jahaan bahut kam samvednik gatividhi ke saath-saath pariman kshinta bhi hoti he
 This can result in severe hypotension
 isliye aam taur par feochromocytoma ke marijon ko unki shalya chikitsa se pehle "salt lod" kii salaah di jaati he
 It may simply interfere such as consumption of excessive salted food before the operation, direct saline replacement or replacement of saline solution via intravenous needle

 kavy main ek prakaar kaa shabd dosha Definition: According to Acharya Mammatt, the main element of poetry is defect, the teacher
 Acharya Vishwanath Prasad has described the defect in the literature as saying "rasapakarshaka Dosh:"
 It is not logical to do
 70 faults are mentioned in poetic light, they are usually divided into five faults: - 1-verse defect 2- Verse verse 3- Sentence defect
 4- Earth Dosh 5- Ras Dosh najd arabi prayadweep ke madhya bhaag kaa naam he
 It is a plateau area
 arabi bhashaa main 'najd' kaa matlab unchaa kshetra hota he or yah naam arabi prayadweep ke bahut se unche kshetron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 But the most well-known of these is the terrain between this peninsula with Hijaz and Yemen mountains to the west, Bahrain's historic area to the east and Iraq and Syria to the north

 The entire plateau has a slight slope from west to east
 yah pathaar atipracheen yug main jwalamukhiyon se ugale gaye jame hue lava kaa bana he, jisamen jagah-jagah par ret ekatrit he
 Its eastern part, which is called al-yamama, contains many oasis where agriculture and trade is carried out, while the western part is more dry and the nomadic Baduin people live there
 najd kii kuch mukhya bhugolic chizein is prakaar hai: Many villages and settlements in the Najd region are inhabited by these dry plains because the water of occasional rains can be saved in the extremely dry environment
 bhuvaigyanik sochate hai ki yah vaadiyaan vastav main un atipracheen nadiyon ke farsh hai jo kabhi is puure kshetra main baha karti thi lekin jo ab, kabhi-kabhi baari varsha hone se panigrast hone ke alaava, salbhar sukhi hi rahati hai
 Najd is historically divided into provinces
 har praant qasbon, bastiyon or gaavon kaa chota sa samooh hota tha jisamen se ek rajdhani hua karti thi
 Each province had its own accent of speaking the Najdi dialect, and each province had certain customs

 Only the knowledge, manparyava gyani, period gyani, the holder of Chaturdasha and the monks holding the tenth are called Agam
 kahin kahin navpurv ke dharak ko bhi aagam mana gaya he
 His words have also been called Agama with treatment
 jab tak aagam bihari muni vidyaman the, tab tak inkaa itnaa mahatv nahin tha, kyonki tab tak muniyon ke aachaar vyavhaar kaa nirdesan aagam muniyon dwaara miltaa tha
 When the Agam Muni is no more, then the Agam composed by him is considered as the basis of cultivation and according to the instructions specified in it, only the Jain Muni perform their cultivation

 The meaning of the prefix 'aa' means Samantaat i
e
 complete and gum dhatu means speed, that is, the person who has a complete knowledge of the substance, is an advance or it can also be said that the person who preaches knowledge in the form of a malevolent Jineshwar Ganadhar, whose script is composed in the form of bound, is called Agam
 aagam sahitya bhi do bhaagon main vibhakt he: angapravisht or angabahm
 The number of organs is 12
 unhen ganipitak yaa dwadashangi bhi kaha jaataa he: In this, the visionism has been completely severed
 shesh gyaarah angon kaa bhi bahut sa ang vichit ho chukaa he
 Apart from this, all the proceeds are Angabahmas; Because Angapravisht is considered to be only Ganadharitam Agam
 ganadharon ke atirikt shrut kevali, purvadhar aadi gyani purushon dwaara rachit aagam angabahm mana jaataa he
 There are different traditions regarding the recognition of proceeds
 digambar amnaay main agmetar sahitya hi he, ve aagam lupt ho chuke, aisa maanate hai
 a tradition in the Shvetambara Amnayya considers 84 agam, a tradition which accepts the above mentioned 45 agamas as agam and one tradition accepts the remaining 32, excluding Mahanishith Oshishruti, Pindanirukti and 10 miscellaneous sutras
 iskaa mul kaaran ye hai ki shwetambar parampara anusaar acharya devardhiganikshama shraman ne 84 aagmon ko lipibaddh kiya tha kintu samay ke saath kai aagam swatah nasht ho gaye, kuch mogul shaskaon ke raaj main nasht kar die gaye evam kai aagam itane prabhaavshaalee the kii unke samaran se devatagan aa jate the, atah aisi vidya ke durupyog se bachane hetu gitarth saadhuon ne use bhandarstha kar diya
 There was no classification of proceeds from Lord Mahavira to Arya Raksha
 pravachak aryarakshit ne shishyon kii suvidha ke liye vishay ke aadhaar par aagmon ko chaar bhaagon main vargeekrut kiya
 In this, all the discussion related to ethics has been given
 aachaar pratipadak aagmon kii sangya charankarnanuyog kii gai he
 Jain philosophy holds that the essence of wisdom is the essence of knowledge

 To assess the spiritual, social and elemental aspect of Indian life, the study of Zenagams is not only necessary, but it is visionary
 terbine ek ghurni ingine he jo kisi taral kii gatij yaa / tathaa sthitij urja ko grahan karke swayan gumti he or apane shoft par lage anya yantron ko ghumaati he
 Wind mill and water mill etc
 are the initial forms of turbines
 vidyut shakti ke utpaadan main terbinon kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 Gas, steam and water-fired turbines differ from each other
 gas compressure yaa pump bhi terbine jaisaa hi hota he par yah terbine ke ulta kaary karata he
 The turbine has at least one rotor assembly that drives this machine with its shaft or drum with one or more blades
 blade par taral padaarth yaa anya padaarth dabaav daalata he jisase roter yaa ghurni chalati he
 It provides kinetic energy to the rotor and rotor
 gas, bhaap or jal terbine main aamtaur par blade ke aasapaas ek aavaran hota he jo drav kii maatra ko niyantrit karata he
 The term "turbine" was coined in 1822 by French mining engineer Claude Burdine from the Latin turbo word
 iskaa ullekh ek sansmaran main unhone kiya tha jo royal science academy paris ko prastut kiya gaya tha
 Benoit Fornerone, an alumnus of Claude Burdine, built the first practical water turbine
 bhaap tarabine ke avishkaar kaa shrey british ejeeniyar sar charles parcens ko, pratikriya tarabine ke avishkaar ke liye or swedish ejeeniyar gustaff de lavaal ko, aaveg tarabine ke avishkaar ke liye diya jaataa he aadhunik bhaap terbine praayah ek hi ikai main pratikriya or aaveg kaa upyog hota he
 Normally the degree of reaction and impulse varies at the root of its circumference blade ab agar tarabine kii karypranali kii baat karen to yah newton ke tisare gati niyam ke adhaar par kaam karti he
 That is, on every action, the opposite reaction occurs
 isi tarah tarabine kaa propeller kaam karata he
 The spindle in the propeller exerts pressure on air or water
 isi dabaav kii vajah se propeller tarabine ko peeche kii ore dhakka martha he, jisase vah chalati he
 Usually the turbine is kept in one place, so that whenever the water passes through it, it is driven by the pressure on each blade of the turbine
 The same rule applies with wind or water turbines
 jitna adhik pani yaa hawa kaa pravaah hoga, tarabine utani tej gati se chalegi
 The working fluid consists of pressure energy and kinetic energy
 drav sampidit yaa asampidit kiya ja saktaa he
 Turbines are employed to collect this energy by implantation of several physical principles
 aaveg terbinon main ucch veg taral yaa gas jet ke pravaah kaa upyog roter blade kii disha badalane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The resulting impulse rotates the turbine and the gas or fluid exits at a slower rate
 is shabd kii vibhinn paribhaashaayen di jaati hai
 According to the detailed definition, a gas turbine is the basic conductor in which the working fluid remains in the gaseous state throughout the thermal cycle and whose speed of all the devices is rotating
 sankeern paribhaasha ke anusaar is shabd kaa prayog sirf us mukhya tarabine ang ke liye kiya jaataa he jiskaa madhyam garam vaayu hoti he
 According to some scholars, a gas turbine is a device in which the flow process is continuous and power is obtained by the turbine
 un mul chaalak yantron ko kehete hai jo jalarashi main nihit sthitij urja ko yantric kaary main parivartit kar dete hai
 Watermills are very simple but also very simple type of tips, which have been used since prehistoric times to produce power
 samay samay par aavashyaktaaon tathaa paristhitiyon se prerit hokar logon ne inamen anek sudhaar kiye, at: jal tarabine bhi panchakki kaa hi viksit rup he
 Over the last half-century, their use has increased so much that many hydroelectricity houses, small and large, started being built by them in almost all civilized countries
 is kaaran sudur jalheen dehaton main bhi bade saste bhav par bijli praapt hone lagi or naanaa prakaar ke udyog dhandhon ke vikaas ko pratsaahan mila
 a steam turbine is a conductor, in which the high-speed steam is driven into a rotor by converting the heat energy of the steam into kinetic energy, and colliding on a number of panels that rotate and operate
 anyonyagtik bhaap ingine main bhaap kii sthitik daab dwaara piston par kaary kiya jaataa he
 Although the steam in the engine moves with the piston, the effect of the kinetic energy of steam in the action of the engine is negligible
 bhaap tarabine main bhaap ingine kii apeksha ucchtar gati mil sakati he or gatisima bhi badi ha sakati he
 Turbine parts have good balance
 bhaap kii samaan maatra evam samaan avasthaa main bhaap tarabine bhaap ingine se adhik shakti paidaa kar saktaa he
 Steam consumption increases after a few years of working with a steam engine, but the turbine does not have such a state
 The steam turbine is the most durable of all the original drivers on earth
 tarabine se sabase bada laabh yah hota he ki isse ghurnak gati sidhe praapt hoti he, jabaki bhaap ingine main anyonyagati se ghurnak gati praapt karne ke liye alag se upadan kaa vyavahar karnaa padataa he
 In a vaporizer, steam is produced at high pressure and temperature
 jab yah bhaap tarabine ke paas pahunchati he, us samay isamen adhik maatra main ushma urja hoti he or isaki daab bhi itani adhik hoti he ki yah nimnadaab tak prasaarit ho sakati he
 But at that time its kinetic energy is negligible
 at: bhaap kuch kaary kar sake iske pehle isaki ushma urja ko gatij urja main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 This change occurs in the well-designed device, expanding the steam
 bhaap kaa prasar yaa to ek hi kriya main purna kiya jaataa he, yaa vibhinn kriyaaon main
 This means that many stationary devices are put into practice to convert heat energy into kinetic energy and often a moving device is placed between two stationary devices
 sthir upkaran main praapt gatij urja ko uske baad bandhe hue gatiman upkaran ke upar kaary karne ke liye lagaaya jaataa he
 maldavalla-pigalapankha is a village in Pauri district of Garhwal division under the state of Uttarakhand, in Chaubatakhal tehsil

 There are many types of transformers, from the point of view of work, from the point of view of the core and from the size-type, but depending on the design, they can be divided into three categories - croadwale parinamitra - iskaa crode nirantar chumbakeey path kaa hota he
 Primary and secondary coils are located in different segments of the core
 kabhi-kabhi praathmik or dwitiyak ghatak ek ytaakar crode ke bhinn bhinn parshvon par hote hai
 Armored Transformers - These are different from core transformers

 rudrashtaadhi do shabd rudra arthath shiv or ashtaadhi arthath aath adhyyon vaala, in aath adhyyon main shiv samaae hai
 Though there are a total of ten chapters in Rudrashtadhyayi, but up to eight are considered as main
 rudrashtaadhi yajurveda kaa ang he or vedon ko hi sarvottam granth bataaya gaya he
 Vedas are parts of Shiva Veda: Shiva: Shiva Veda: arthath veda hi shiv he tathaa shiv hi veda hai, veda kaa pradurbhaav shiv se hi hry he
 Lord Shiva and Vishnu are also monogamous when both are called Harihar, Hari means Narayana and Hara means Mahadev Veda and Narayana are also Vedo Narayana: Swayam Swayambhuriti Shushrutam
 yahi kaaran he ki bhartiya samskruti main vedon kaa itnaa mahatv he tathaa inke hi shlokon, sookhton se puja, yajna, abhishek aadi kiya jaataa he
 Everything belongs to Shiva and Shiva resides in all, Shiva, Mahadev, Hari, Vishnu, Brahma, Rudra, Neelkanth etc
 are all synonymous with Brahma
 rudra arthath 'rut' or rut arthath jo du:khon ko nasht kare, vahi rudra he, rutan--du:khan, dravayati--nashyati iti rudra:
 It is written in the Rudrahadhyopanishad- sarvadevatmako rudra: survey deva: shivatmaka:
 Rudratpravartate Bijan Bijayiranijarnardan:
 
 Yo Rudra: s Brahma Himself y Brahma s Hutashan:
 brahmavishnumyo rudra agnishomatmakan jagat
 
 yah shloke bataata he ki rudra hi brahma, vishnu he sabhi devtaa rudransh he or sabakuch rudra se hi janma he
 From this it is proved that Rudra is Brahma, he is Swayambhu
 isi rudra ke upasna ke nimitt rudrashtaadhi granth veda kaa hi sarabhoot sangrah he
 Just as we extract butter from milk, similarly Rudrakashtadhyayi has also collected from Janakalyanartha Shuklayajurveda
 is granth main grihasthadharm, rajdharm, gyaan-vairajna, shanti, ishvarastuti aadi anek sarvottam vishyon kaa varnan he
 Ritualing of Rudra is the main and excellent means to ensure that the human mind is not subjectively attained to degeneration and the person can keep his mind clean
 yah rudranushthan pravriti maarg se nivritti maarg ko praapt karne main samarth he
 In this, both Nirguna and Saguna forms of Brahma are described
 jahaan lok main iske jap, paath tathaa abhishek aadi sadhano se bhagavadbhakti, shanti, putr pautradi vruddhi, dhan dhaany kii sampannataa or swasth jivan kii prapti hoti he; vahiin paralok main sadgati evam moksh bhi praapt hota he
 In the Brahmin texts of the Veda, the Upanishads, Smriti and many Puranas describe the glory of Rudrashtadhyayi and Rudrabhisheka
 vayupurana main likhaa he-- Yash Sagarparyantaam sashailavanakanam
 sarvannatmagunopetan suvrikshajalashobhitam
 
 dadyat kanchansanyuktaan bhumin chaushadhisanyutam
 Tasmadapyadhikam tasya sakdrudrajapadbhvet

 arth: jo vyakti samudraparyant, van, parvat, jal evam vrikshon se yukt tathaa shreshth gunon se yukt aisi prithvi kaa daan karata he, jo dhanadhanya, suvarna or aushadhiyon se yukt he, usase bhi adhik punya ek baar ke rudri jap evam rudrabhishek kaa he
 Therefore, one who recites Rudri after meditating on Lord Shiva, he definitely becomes Rudrapru from that body, there is no doubt about it
 is prakaar saadhan pujan kii drushti se sudrashtaadhi kaa vishesh mahatv he
 Often some people have the belief that basically the Vedas of the Vedas etc
 are virtuous, so it is only necessary to read and listen to these mantras
 veda tathaa veda ke arth tathaa uske gambhir tatwon se vidwaan praaia: anbhigya hai

 a survey in which the shape of the Earth is considered to be a spheroid, which measures the curvature of the Earth before using measurements taken on its surface, is called a geometric survey
 yah kathin prakriya hoti he
 But if the distances measured on the round or curved surface of the earth are not too long, then they will not be considered as curved, and there will be no special error
 udaahranarth, prithvi kii vakr sataha par 11
5 mile lambii rekha naapane par usamen prithvi ke kaaran keval 0
05 foot kii truti hogi
 Similarly, if a triangle of 75 square miles area is represented by any three points on the surface of the earth by straight lines on the plane surface, then the difference of only one second in the sum of its angles and the angles on the curved surface of the same triangle
 Will happen
 is kaaran yadi chote chote kshetron ke nakshe taiyaar kiye jaaen, to prithvi kii sataha par lee gai naap ko sidhi rekhaon main satal par pradarshit karne se koi khatakanevaali galati nahin hogi
 Therefore, considering the small area of the earth as flat, the measurements taken on it are plotted on flat paper on any scale without refinement
 is prakaar ke surveykshan ko patt surveykshan kehete hai
 Surveys in general practice are planar surveys
 bhinn uddeshyon kii siddhi ke liye surveykshanon kii prakriya, upkaran, paimaana aadi main bhi kuch antar paidaa ho jaataa he
 Due to these reasons, several categories of board survey have also been made: yadi aise samatleey surveykshanon se bharat jaise vistrut desh yaa mahadweep ke maanchitr sankalit kiye ja saken, to patt surveykshanon kaa mahatv aashaatheet bad jaataa he
 This will be possible only if the foundation of the platen surveys is on the geometric survey
 aadharshila kaa ullekh tabhi grahya ho sakegaa, jab uski kuch sankshipt vyakhya kar di jaae
 Surveys are classified according to different grounds in the following manner: ye siddhant bade hi saral hai
 On the surface of the earth, two points can be easily selected which can be seen from each other's position and the distance between them can be measured
 inhen kisi bhi vaanchit paimaane par kaagaj par aise lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unke nikatavarti kshetra kaa surveykshan kaagaj par samaa sake
 After this, by measuring the distance of any third point from these two points, you can mark its relative position on the paper with the same scale
 is prakaar ankit kinhin bhi do binduon se kisi tisare agyaat bindu kii duuri nikaalkar tathaa krmanugat ankit karke, puure kshetra kaa maanchitr banaaya ja saktaa he
 In other words, the method of surveying is the creation of triangles
 upar to tribhuj kii ek hi rachana kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, jisamen tribhuj kii teenon bhujaaon kii lambaaiyaan gyaat he
 Other composition methods of the triangle are also used in the survey
 vistrut lekh surveykshan ke aadharbhoot siddhanth dekhen
 In order to design a geography in the right geographical location, within the area of the map the first need is to have a mesh of key control points whose relative relative latitude and elevation relative to Greenwich are known
 mahan trikoshmetiya surveykshan ne bharat ke adhikansh maanchitron ke nirmaan main yah kar liya he
 In essence, it is about 10 miles long, meticulously measured by invar metal wire or lace on flat land, which is called 'base'
 aadhaar kii sthapana ke baad usapar ek ke baad ek upyukt bhujaa or kone ke tribhujon kii maala rachi jaati he
 The angles of the triangles are calculated by calculating the sides and regulators of the points
 ise trikoniya surveykshan kehete hai
 The network of triangles is spread everywhere in the survey
 mukhya upkaran kaach chaap theodolite he jisamen urdhwadhar tathaa kshaitij konon ko chaap ke ek second ansh yaa isse bhi kam tak sahi padhane kii kshamta hoti he
 These points are quite far apart
 at: vistrut surveykshan sambhav nahin
 For this it is necessary to break the large triangles of the great trigonometric survey and make a net of smaller triangles and transform the entire land into a series of points at a distance of a few miles
 icchit paimaane par prekshap banaaya jaataa he
 Control points are marked in interpolation

 These exorcists used the Benedictine formula "wade Retro Satna" around this time

 Poetry, poetry or poetry, is the genre of literature in which a story or emotion is artistically expressed by a language

 But 'elegance' of 'earth' can be of many types
 isse yah lakshan bahut spasht nahin he
 Literature is the most appropriate sign of the poet Vishwanath
 uske anusaar 'rasaatmak vaakya hi kavy he'
 Ras is the soul of poetry of pleasant communication of the souls
 kavyprakash main kavy teen prakaar ke kahe gaye hai, dhwani, gunibhoot vyangy or chitra
 Sound is one in which the hidden meaning is dominant, rather than the meaning derived from the words
 gunibhoot byangy vah he jisamen gaun ho
 a picture or an ornament is one in which a miracle is done without exorcism
 in teenon ko kramshah uttam, madhyam or adham bhi kehete hai
 The poetic lighter's emphasis seems to be more on the hidden sense, not on the stimulus of the juice
 kavy ke do or bhed kiye gaye hai, mahakavy or khand kavy
 The epic canto and its hero must be a deity, king, or Dhirodatta, a rich Kshatriya
 usamen shringaar, vir yaa shant rason main se koi ras pradhan hona chahie
 Periodic compassion; Humor etc

 kavy do prakaar kaa mana gaya he, drishy or shravy
 Visual poetry is that which is shown by acting, such as drama, skit, etc
 which is readable and listenable, it is audible
 shravy kavy do prakaar kaa hota he, gadhy or padya
 The epic and Khandakavya of the verse poetry have been called two distinctions
 gadhy kavy ke bhi do bhed kiye gaye hai- katha or aakhyayika
 Champu, Virud and Karambhaka are considered three types of poetry and poetry
 saamanyat: sanskrit ke kavy-sahitya ke do bhed kiye jate hai- drishy or shravy
 In addition to visual poetic words, the costumes, gestures, motifs, actions and performances of the characters bring excitement to the audience's heart
 drishykavy ko 'roopak' bhi kehete hai kyonki uskaa rasaswadan netron se hota he
 Audible poetry communicates juice to the heart of readers and listeners through words
 shravyakavy main padya, gadhy or champoo kaavyon kaa samavesh kiya jaataa he
 The word 'padya', which is removed from the padma in the motion, indicates the primacy of motion
 at: padyakavy main taal, lay or chand kii vyavastha hoti he
 Again there are two strains of the verse - the epic and the Khandakavya
 khandakavy ko ‘muktkavy’ bhi kehete hai
 In the Khandakavya, instead of a complete chronicle of life like the epic, one part is described
 kavitv ke saath-saath sangitatkata kii pradhanta hone se hi inako hindi main ‘geetikavy’ bhi kehete hai
 The meaning of 'geeti' is to express the emotional spirit of the heart in a phased manner
 geeti kii aatma bhavatirek he
 The poet of his emotional sensation and imagination makes the narrative emotional
 geetikavy main kavyashastreey roodhiyon or paramparaon se mukt hokar vaiyaktik anubhav ko saralata se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 By nature, the shape-type of lyrical poetry is smaller than the epic
 in sab tattvon ke sahyog se sanskrit muktakkavy ko ek utkrisht kavyarup mana jaataa he
 Muktakavya has become more popular than the epics
 sanskrit main geetikavy muktak or prabandh donon roopon main praapt hota he
 The best example of managerial lyricism is Meghdoot
 adhikansh prabandh geetikavy isi ke anukaran par likhe gayi hai
 Muktak is that in which each verse is independent in itself
 iske sundar udhaaharan amaruukshatak or bhatruharishtakatray hai
 Musical verses are characteristic of melodious verse lyrics
 shringaar, niti, vairaygy or prakruti iske pramukh pratipaadya vishay he
 a natural depiction of the beauty and nature of women is found in these poems
 upadesh, niti or lokvyavahaar ke sutara inamen bade hi romantic dhang se praapt ho jate hai
 This is the reason that the Suktikas and Subhashitas are found in abundance in Muktakayas
 muktakkavy kii parampara sfoot sandesh rachanaaon ke rup main vaidic yug se hi praapt hoti he
 In the Rigveda there is a reference to sending a dog named Sarma as messenger
 vaidic muktakkavy ke udaahranon main vasishtha or vamdev ke sookt, ullekhneey hai
 In the Ramayana, Mahabharata and their later texts, this type of sphincter is available in large quantities
 kadachit mahakavi valmiki ke shakodgaaron main yah bhaavana gopit rup main rahi he
 Hanuman, the messenger of Sri Rama sent to husband husbandman Pravasini Sita, Sri Krishna sent by Dharmaraja Yudhishthira towards Duryodhana and messenger Hans sent by King Nal near Sundari Dayamanti are the references counted under this tradition
 is sandarbh main bhagwat puraana kaa venugit vishesh rup se uddharaneey he jisaki rasvibhor karne vaali bhaavana chhavi sanskrit muktakkavyon par ankit he
 Rajasekhar has told in the episode of Kavicharya that the poet should take education of academics and sub-disciplines
 vyakaran, kosh, chand, or alankaar - ye chaar vidyaayein hai
 64 arts are subtexts
 kavitv ke 8 strot hai- swasthya, pratibha, abhyaas, bhakthi, vidwatkatha, bahushrutata, smritidrishta or raag
 Mammatt has stated six purposes of poetry - kavita yaa kavy kya he is vishay main bhartiya sahitya main aalochakon kii badi samrudh parampara he— acharya vishwanath, panditraj jagannatha, pandit ambikadutt vyas, acharya shripati, bhamah aadi sanskrit ke vidwaanon se lekar aadhunik acharya ramchandra shukla tathaa jaishankar prasad jaise prabud kaviyon or aadhunik yug kii mira mahadevi verma ne kavita kaa swaroop spasht karte hue apane apane mat vyakt kiye hai
 Scholars believe that the human heart wanders in the infinite form, trades of the eternal world, but when the human ego abandons the spirit and remains a pure feeling, then it becomes a free heart
 hriday kii is mukti kii sadhana ke liye manushya kii vaani jo shabd vidhaan karti ai he use kavita kehete hai
 Poetry elevates human beings from the narrow circle of selfish relationships and helps in making a raga connection with the rest of creation
 kavy kii anek paribhaashaayen di gai hai
 These definitions also hold true for modern Hindi poetry
 kavy siddh chitt ko alokik anandanubhuti karaata he to hriday ke taar zankrut ho uthte hai
 Poetry also contains the feeling of Satyam Shiva Sundaram
 jis kavy main yah sab kuch paaya jaataa he vah uttam kavy mana jaataa he
 There are two distinctions of poetry: swaroop ke aadhaar par kavy ke do bhed hai - shravyakavy evam drushyakavy
 The poetry which is praised by listening to others or reading by itself is called audible poetry
 jaise ramayana or mahabharat
 Audio poetry also has two distinctions - Prabandha poetry and Muktak poetry
 isamen koi pramukh katha kavy ke aadi se ant tak krambaddh rup main chalati he
 The sequence of the story breaks in the middle and secondary stories become helpful in between
 jaise ramcharita maanas
 There are two distinctions of management poetry - epic and Khandakavya
 1- mahakavy isamen kisi aitihaasik yaa puranic mahapurush kii sampurna jivan katha kaa adyopant varnan hota he
 These things must be in the epic - 2- khandakavy isamen kisi kii sampurna jeevanakatha kaa varnan na hokar keval jivan ke kisi ek hi bhaag kaa varnan hota he
 It is necessary to have these things in the section Poetry- isamen keval ek hi pad yaa chand swatantra rup se kisi bhav yaa ras athwa katha ko prakat karne main samarth hota he
 The songs, poets, doha etc
 are free
 jis kavy kii anandanubhuti abhinay ko dekhakar evam paatro se cathopakathan ko sun kar hoti he use drishy kavy kehete hai
 Like in a drama or a movie
 1- padya kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan kavy main kiya jaataa he, jaise gitanjali 2- Prose Poetry - In this, a story is described in prose, such as Jaishankar's commission
 
 
 gadhy main kavy rachana karne ke liye kavi ko chand shaastra ke niyamon se svachhndatha praapt hoti he
 3- Champu Poetry - It consists of both prose and poetry
 maithilisharan gupt kii 'yashodhara' champu kavy he
 The history of modern Hindi poetry is about 800 years old and its beginning is understood from the thirteenth century
 har bhashaa kii tarah hindi kavita bhi pehle itivrittatmak thi
 That is, a story was tied with a rhythm and decorated with ornaments
 bhartiya sahitya ke sabhi pracheen granth kavita main hi likhe gaye hai
 The specific reason for this was that poetry was easy to memorize due to the rhythm and verses
 jis samay chhapekhane kaa avishkaar nahin hua tha or dastavezon kii anek pratiyaan bananaa aasaan nahin tha us samay mahatvapurn baton ko yaad rakh lene kaa yah sarvottam saadhan tha
 That is why at that time, along with literature, politics, science and Ayurveda were also written in the verse itself
 bharat kii pracheenatam kavitaayen sanskrit bhashaa main rugveda main hai jinamein prakruti kii prashasti main likhe gaye chhandon kaa sundar sankalan hai
 Many other subjects of life have also found place in these poems
 rooyee ke sooton yaa vastron ko jab daahak soda ke saath upachaarit kiya jaataa he, tab unamem utkrisht koti kii, sthaayee resham si chamak aa jaati he
 Such yarns or textiles are called mercerized yarns or textiles and the process of getting mercerized is called mercerization
 is prakriya ke avishkaarak ek angrej rasayanajna marsar the, jinhone iskaa avishkaar 1844 i main kiya tathaa 1850 i main iskaa patent karaayaa tha
 The process is named Mercerization after him
 marsrikaran se keval chamak hi nahin aati varan lagbhag 15% majbootee or ranjak grahan karne kii kshamta bad jaati he
 Socks made of mercerized cotton, vest, other underwear, chest threads, shoes and air feathers are good and for many other works where brightness and strength are necessary, items made from it are considered good
 marsrikaran daahak soda ke vilyan ke prayog se sampann hota he
 By treating such a solution, the cotton swells
 phoolne ke pashchaat soot kaa sikudna swaabhaavik he, par use sikudne nahi diya jaataa
 Shrinking does not shine
 soot ko khinchakar aise band rakhte hai ki vah sikude nahin
 In the machine in which this action is performed, there are different vessels for burning soda, soda elution, dilute acid and acid elution, between which the yarn is passed out by passing respectively
 mashin ke baahar bhi soot kii pun: dhulaai hoti he, taaki usase amla kaa purna niraakaran ho jaae
 Long fiber cotton is considered good for the mercerization
 ikhari parat ke soot par marsrikaran se chamak nahin aati, par isse soot ke ranjak grahan karne kii kshamta avashya bad jaati he
 Only the yarn of the double parama shines
 dohari parat ke soot kaa hi sabase adhik maatra main marsrikaran hota he
 In addition to burning soda, reagents may also be suitable for mercury
 aise abhikarmakon main salphurik amla yaa nitric amla bhi hai
 But they fear the decomposition of cotton
 inke sandran ke sambandh main badi saavdhaanee baratani padati he
 a second reagent is triton B, or tetra alkyl ammonium hydroxide, which dissolves as well as merges cotton
 par marsrikaran ke liye sasta hone ke kaaran keval daahak soda hi bade paimaane par prayukt hota he
 It is believed that the merging of dahk soda makes cellulose, alkali cellulose
 kuch logon kaa mat he ki yah elkali cellulose ek adhishoshan sankar he
 On washing, this alkali substance gets decomposed and comes out of the yarn
 punarjanit cellulose rasayanat: saamaanya cellulose sa hi hota he, par aisa samajha jaataa he ki uski aanvik avasthaa main parivartan avashya hua he, jisase usamen chamak aa gai he
 About 13 to 14 per hundred liters of soda in the solution is sufficient, but as the mercerization progresses, the concentration decreases
 at: marsrikaran ke liye sarvapratham 20 se 25 prati shat vilyan kaa upyog karnaa acha hota he
 If the heat is low, a weak solution can also be used, but there is no significant benefit
 soda ke saath kuch anya padaarthon ke daalane kaa bhi suzav diya gaya he
 Some of these increase the flowering of yarn, but most of them cause a decline in flowering
 marsrikaran se rooyee ke gunon main koi parivartan nahin hota
 Certain qualities of cotton must be increased
 avasorana gun 25 se 50% bad jaataa he
 Mercerized shrub cotton has the highest absorption capacity
 rooyee ke sukhaane se avasorana main baadha pahunchati he
 The ability to absorb dyes also decreases
 marsrikrut cellulose ke liye parikshipt cellulose or cellulose hydrate aadi naam bhi die gaye hai, par ye naam thik nahin hai
 The X-ray diffraction diagram of a merced cotton is different from the x-ray diffraction diagram of a normal cotton
 marsrikrut soot kii pahchaan uske ranjak avasorana gun se ha sakati he
 It is dyed more thick than normal yarn
 rangeen marsrikrut soot kii pahchaan nil kii barita avasorana reeti se kii jaati he
 Mercerized yarn usage is increasing day by day
 aaj bahut badi maatra main aise hi soot ke vastra ban rahe hai
 Its widespread behavior has increased in the last 60 years only
