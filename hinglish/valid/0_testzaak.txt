 He wants to kill Ghazni so that his memory cycle disappears again and he forgets the present

 While mocking Sanjay, he narrates the gruesome tale of how he murdered Kalpana, when suddenly Sanjay overcomes his power with the ultimate boil
 sanjay gajani ko thik usee tarah martha he jis tarah gajani ne kalpana kii hatya kii thi
 The film progresses to its end, with Sanjay still working as a volunteer in an orphanage suffering from a memory loss

 madhya-aadharunder the law of the sea, an Exclusive Economic Zone is a seazone over which a state has special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources
 Generally a state's EEZ extends to a distance of 200 nautical miles out from its coast
 The exception to this rule occurs when eezs overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nautical miles apart
 When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual boundary
 Otherwise, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the most proximate state
 The Exclusive Economic Zone starts at the coastal baseline and extends 200 nautical miles out into the sea, perpendicular to the baseline
 Thus, the EEZ overlaps both the contiguous zone and territorial waters
 This concept of allotting nations eezs to give better control of maritime affairs outside territorial limits gained acceptance in the late 20th century and was given binding international recognition by the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982
 Part V, Article 55 of the Convention states: Fisheries management is a significant aspect of the resulting control
 Disputes over the exact extent of Exclusive Economic Zones are a common source of conflict between states over marine waters
 Areas where a permanent ice shelf extends beyond the coastline are also sources of potential dispute
 1,159,063 km2 Australia has the third largest exclusive economic zone, behind the United States and France, but ahead of Russia, with the total area actually exceeding that of its land territory
 As per UN convention, Australia's EEZ generally extends 200 nautical miles from the coastline of Australia and its external territories, except where a maritime delimitation agreement exists with another state
 Australia has also claimed, in its submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its Antarctic Territory but has requested it not to be considered, in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty
 However, Australia maintains the right to explore and exploit the seabed and water column within its EEZ
 Source Canada is unusual in that its exclusive economic zone, covering 2,755,564 km2, is slightly smaller than its territorial waters
 The latter generally extend only 12 nautical miles from the shore, but also include inland marine waters such as Hudson Bay, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the internal waters of the Arctic archipelago
 The EEZ of the European Union is shared, so vessels or a national from one country can fish in another country's EEZ
 The combined zone amounts to 25 million km2, making it larger than the United States' zone, the largest of any single country
 '"see: Common Fisheries Policy
 Due to its numerous overseas départements and territories scattered on all oceans of the planet, France possesses the second-largest EEZ in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2, just behind the EEZ of the United States, but ahead of the EEZ of Australia
 According to a different calculation cited by the Pew Research Center, the EEZ of France would be 10,084,201 km2, behind the United States, but ahead of Australia and Russia
 The EEZ of France covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the eezs of the world, whereas the land area of the French Republic is only 0
45% of the total land area of the Earth
 Greece has not yet claimed an exclusive economic zone, although it is entitled to do so, as per UNCLOS 1982 as well as customary international law
 The reason for its inaction is the direct Turkish threat of casus belli
 Turkey's declaration of casus belli is not related to the EEZ issue
 Aegean Sea is a semi-closed sea which has a special nature
 Moreover, Turkey is not among the signatories of UNCLOS which allows countries to expand width of their territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles
 Besides, Turkey is a persistent objector to the relevant article of UNCLOS
 In 1995, just after Greece's ratification of UNCLOS, Turkey declared that if Greece expands the width of her territorial waters over 6 nautical miles, Turkey would conceive this action as a containment attempt and a direct offence to her sovereignty
 So, Turkish Parliament decided that if Greece attempts to expand the width of her territorial waters it would be a cause of war 
 EEZ problem -which is waiting for a viable solution- is just another problem between Turkey and Greece besides other problems
 Portugal has the 3rd largest Exclusive Economic Zone of the EU and the 11th in the world
 764,071 km2 Japan has disputes over its EEZ boundaries with all its Asian neighbors
 The above and relevant maps at the Sea Around Us Project both indicate Japan's claimed boundaries, and does not take into account neighboring power's claims
 New Zealand's EEZ covers 4,083,744 km2, according to the Sea Around Us Project, which is approximately fifteen times the land area of the country
 Sources vary significantly on the size of New Zealand's EEZ; for example, a recent government publication gave the area as roughly 4,300,000 km2
 These figures are for the EEZ of New Zealand proper, and do not include the eezs of other territories in the Realm of New Zealand 
 Norway has a large exclusive economic zone of 819 620 km2 around its coast
 The country has a fishing zone of 1,878,953 km2, including fishing zones around Svalbard and Jan Mayen
 The fact that the European Union shares its economic zones was a big reason why Norway did not entered the EU as a member
 Source information needed Largest EEZ in the world: 11,351,000 km2 / 4,383,000 mi2 Jogeshchandra Banerjee was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1965 by the Government of India in the field of medical science

 In this, Ijna is hired by an intelligence officer Ayan Thakur and security chief Guru Saldanah to retrieve important information from a dangerous killer
 is mishan ke dauraan, aayan ko kabir or ijanaa ke pichley sambandhon ke bare main pataa chalata he
 During a mission, Kabir was arresting drug dealers
 tabhi vahaan ijanaa bhi milti he
 Just then he comes to know that he is being used in this work
 kabir uske paas se ek sikaa letaa he or use giraftaar na karne kaa faisla karata he
 After this, Ijna starts loving him and follows him to his house to give him a letter written in blood
 iske baad donon ek duusare se pyaar karnaa shuru kar dete hai, parantu ek din kabir bina kuch kahe hi gaayab ho jaataa he
 Even after six years, he is not known
 ek mishan ke liye ijanaa ko srilanka main ek awasaiya colony main janaa tha
 Here Kabir was also living with an identity of a musician
 yahan ijanaa or aayan mangetar ke rup main kaary karne ke liye aate hai
 Ijana goes to the neighborhood house as a new neighbor arrives
 tab vah kabir ko dekhati he
 But Kabir says that he does not recognize him
 iske baad agle din uske ghar ke khidki par rakt se "kshamaa" likhaa hota he
 And then a call comes and Kabir leaves from there
 iske baad kabir guru saladanah kii team par hamalaa karata he, lekin vah bhaag jaataa he
 Then Ayaan thinks of stealing the data from Kabir's house and at the same time Ijna Kabir gets Ijna's letter in which Ijna wants to meet him
 kabir ghar se baahar usase milane ko jaataa he
 Ayan then gets information from his laptop, but Kabir's mobile gets a warning that someone is stealing information from his laptop
 tabhi kabir uske ghar main jaataa he
 Till then, Ayan steals all the information and runs away
 jaankaree dekhne ke baad aayan ko pataa chalata he ki sari jaankaree galat he
 Kabir, who still trusts Ijna; He meets his friend Sumit
 iske baad vah ijanaa se miltaa he or usase shaadi karne kaa prastaav detaa he or aayan kaa ghar chhodane ke liye bhi kahata he
 Ijna agrees to this
 kabir sumit se shaadi kii taiyaari karne ko kahata he
 When Ayan comes to know about this, he gets angry
 sumit galati se aayan kaa sandesh ijamaa ke mobile main pard letaa he or use pataa chal jaataa he ki vah ek jasoos he
 Some gunmen kill Sumit
 par aayan ijanaa ko phone kar yah kahata he ki ek jaruri baat he
 When Ijana meets Ayaan, he says that Kabir killed Sumit and will kill you too
 or vah use jehar detaa he jise vah kabir ke peya main mila de
 When Ijna was not at home, seeing this, Kabir goes to Ayan's house and then he comes to know about Sumit's Bluetooth
 sumit ke bare main or adhik jaankaree praapt karne ke liye kabir uske ghar ko puri tarah se jaanchata he
 Just then he finds a book inside Ijna's bag
 isamen vahi kahani thi jaisaa kii ijanaa ne aayan se milane kaa use bataaya tha
 He then stops at home
 jab ijanaa aati he to ijanaa aayan kaa diya hua jehar kabir ke coffee main mila kar use detii he
 Kabir tells her that he left Ijna for a sting operation several years ago as several of his own officials, security forces and politicians were corrupted
 isliye, vah unhen chunata tha or uske baad vah unhen maar daalaa karata tha
 According to Kabir, he was a patriot, not a terrorist
 vah jehar vaala coffee ko baahar phek detaa or kahata he ki guru saladanah ek dhokebaaz he
 He will kill you by taking basic information
 vah ijanaa se kahata he ki vah swiss bank se aseemit paise nikaal sakati he
 In addition, he can provide her with a new passport, ticket, and more
 parantu ijanaa in sabhi baton ko nahin maanati or kabir ke gale mil kar chumban detii he or jane se pehle uske pet main goli maar detii he
 Kabir dies immediately
 jab ijanaa guru saladanah ke paas jaankaree lekar jaati he to use pataa chalata he ki kabir kii baat sach thi or vah ek dhokebaaz he
 After she finished the task, Ayaan had the task of killing Ijana
 parantu baad main aayan kaa man badal gaya or vah guru saladanah ko hi maar detaa he
 Because he loves Ijna
 ijanaa uske dhokhadhadi vaale mishan main saath thi or aankh band karke us par bharosa kiya
 Because of that the love of his life killed an innocent person
 aayan ijanaa ko kahata he ki yadi usne ghar choda to vah use maar degaa
 Then Ijna says that being with her, she likes to kill Kabir and Ijna leaves the house
 ijanaa ke jate samay aayan us par peeche se goli chalata he
 As soon as Ijna is shot, she turns and shoots Ayan several times and along with Ayan, she too dies and the story ends

 Java is a programming language originally developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of the Java platform of Sun Microsystems
 bhashaa apana adhikansh vaakya vinyas c or C++ se praapt karti he lekin iske paas ek saral object model or kuch nimna str kii suvidhaayen maujuud hai
 Java experiments are typically compiled for bytecode that can be started on any Java virtual machine with any computer architecture
 1995 se san dwaara mul tathaa sandarbh karyanvayan java sankalkon, virtual mashiinon or class librariyon ko viksit kiya gaya
 As of May 2007, Sun made most of its Java technologies available as free software under the GNU General Public License, with special mention of the Java Community Process
 Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Classpath and the GNU Compiler for Java
 june 1991 main james goseling ne apane kai set-top box pariyojnaon main se kisi ek pariyojna main upyog karne ke liye java bhashaa pariyojna ko prarambh kiya

 yah java naam krambaddh shabdon kii ek suchi main se liya gaya
 Gosling aimed to introduce a virtual machine and a language that is familiar with c / c ++ style methodology
 1995 main san ne java 1

 It promised "right Once, Run Anywhere", offering no-cost run-time on popular platforms

 Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within webpages, and Java soon became well-known
 java 2 ke aagaman ke saath naye bhashaantaron main bahu akruti thi jo vibhinn prakaar ke platformon ke liye nirmit thi
 For example, J2EE targeted for enterprise applications and the most recent version J2ME for mobile applications
 J2SE targeted the standard version
 2006 main, vyaper ke uddeshy se san ne J2 ke naye varsano kaa naam badalakar kramash: java EE, java ME or java SE kar diya
 In 1997, Sun Microsystems sent a proposal to the ISO / IEC JTC1 Standards Committee to implement Java and later to ACMA International, but soon withdrew from the process
 java samudaay prakriya dwaara niyantrit java vastav main ek di phacto maanak bana hua he
 Despite its status as a software owner, Sun once provided most of the Java implementation at no charge
 Sun profited from Java by selling licenses to specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System
 Sun made a distinction between its software development kit and runtime environment); Primary differences include jre's lack of compilers, utility programs, and header files
 13 navambar 2006 ko, san ne GNU general public license ke sharton ke adheen adhikansh java ko swatantra or mukt strot software ke rup main release kiya
 On May 8, 2007, Sun ended the process, making all of Java's core code available under free software / free-source distribution terms, except for a small piece of code that Sun does not own
 java bhashaa ko nirmit karne ke paanch mukhya uddeshy the: Although most of Java's direct profits come from licensing and JCP subscription funds, some believe that Java is primarily a vehicle for hardware server promotion and / or sales of Solaris OS for Sun internally, and Sun's vice president Rich Green Said that Sun's ideal role for Java is similar to "evangelism"
 java kii ek visheshta vahniyata he, jiskaa matlab he ki java bhashaa main likhe gaye computer program kisi bhi hardware samarthit / oparating system plateform par samaan rup se kaary karata he
 This is achieved by compiling the Java language code, not from machine code, but from Java bytecode, - the instruction conforms to the machine signal but would be intended to be interpreted by a virtual machine written specifically for host hardware
 and-yuzars saamaanya taur par staneylon prayog mashin / yaa java aplates ke liye web broujar main java rantime envyranment kaa istemaal karte hai, jo unke swayan ke mashin par santhaapit he
 Standardized libraries provide a functional way to access host-specific features such as: graphing, threading and networking
 bitcode ko istemaal karne kaa sabase mukhya laabh he vahanta
 jo kuch bhi ho, bhashaantaran ke upree bhaag kaa matlab hota he ki bhashantarit programs hameshaa mul nishpadanyogy se sankalit programs se zyada dhire chalati hai or bure pradarshan ke kaaran java kii saakh ko nuksaan hota he
 Recently, with the introduction of several optimization techniques in JVM implementation, this problem has been reduced slightly
 san microsystems aadhikarik taur par java maanak sanskaran plateform Linux, Mac OS x or Solaris ke liye license detii he
 haalanki, purv main san ne Microsoft ko java license diya, license kii avadhi samaapt ho chuki he or iskaa phir se naveekaran nahin kiya gaya he
 Through a network of third-group vendors and licensees, alternative Java environments are available for it and other platforms
 java brands kaa upyog karne ke liye san kaa trademark license dridhtaapurvak kahata he ki sabhi kriyanvayan 'upyukt' ho
 This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft when Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support RMI and JNI and had additional platform-specific features of its own
 san ne 1997 main abhiyog chalaaya or 2001 main 20 million dollar kaa bhugtan or saath hi saath san ke license kii sharto ko lagu karne kaa court kaa aadesh bhi paaya
 As a result, Microsoft did not run Java for long with Windows, and in recent versions of Windows, Internet Explorer cannot support Java applets without third-party control
 Sun and others provided a free Java run-time system for that and other versions of Windows
 java EE ranneeti ke liye plateform-swatantra java aavashyak he or yahaan tak ki kriryanvayan ko pramanit karne ke liye or sakht vaidhikaran jaruri he
 Using the embedded Java environment, this environment enables portable server-side applications such as web services, servlets and enterprise javabeans, as well as embedded systems based on osgi
 glassfish pariyojna ke dwaara san java EE praudyogiki kaa purna sanchalit, ekikrut mukt strot karyanvayan ke liye kaary kar rahaa he
 Sun also distributes a superset of JRE called Java Development Kit, which includes development tools such as Java Compiler, Javadoc, Jar and Debugger
 java program ke pradarshan kaa iske samatuly multah sankalit bhashaa main likhe gaye program se tulana karnaa kathin he kyonki java ke bitcode compiler kaa target plateform, java plateform hi he or bitcode JVM dwaara mashin code main yaa to bhashantarit kar diya jaataa he yaa sankalit kar diya jaataa he
 These two different approaches: static vs
 dynamic compilation and recompilation and comparing other generated scenarios are very difficult and different
 sankalit bhashaaon main likhe prograamon kii tulana main java main likhe prograamon kaa dhimaa hona or adhik memory kii aavashyaktaa hona ek visheshta rahi he
 However, the implementation speed of Java programs has increased rapidly with the advent of just-in-time compilation, additional language features that support improved code analysis, and self-optimization in Java virtual machines
 object jivan chakra main smriti kaa prabandhan karne ke liye java ek swachaalit kachra sangrahakarta kaa upyog karata he
 The programmer determines when the object will be created and the Java runtime has the responsibility to recover its memory once the object is no longer usable
 ek baar jab object kaa koi sandarbh baaki nahin rahata, tab agamya object sangraahak dwaara swatah mukt hone ke yogya ho jaataa he
 Something similar to a memory leak can persist if a programmer's code catches a reference to an object that is no longer needed, similarly when objects that are no longer needed are stored in a container that is still Is in use agar astitvaviheen object ke liye paddatiyon ko bulaayaa jaataa hai, ek "nal pointer excepshan" phenkaa jaataa he
 One idea behind Java's automated memory management model is that programmers reduce the burden of performing regular memory management
 In some languages, memory for object creation is allocated or explicitly allocated on the stack and reallocated from the stack
 har tarah se smriti prabandhan kii jimmedaari programmer ke saath rahati he
 If the program does not reallocate an object, a memory leak occurs
 agar kaarykram smriti kaa abhigaman yaa punah aavantit karne kaa prayaas karata he jo pehle hi punahavantit kiya ja chukaa he, tab parinaam kaa anumaan lagaana or vyakhya karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he or kaarykram sambhawatah yaa to asthir or / yaa to samaapt ho jaataa hai
 This can be partially rectified using smart signals but it increases overhead and complexity
 kachra sangrahan kisi bhi samay ho saktaa he
 Ideally this will happen when the program is empty
 agar nae object ko aavantit karne ke liye swatantra smriti aparyaapt he tab iskaa chalaaya janaa nishchit he, yah kshambhar ke liye ek kaarykram sthapit karne kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Explicit memory management is not possible in Java
 java c / C++ style suchak ankaganit ko samarthan nahin karata he, jahaan par object adress or achinhit intigers ko adla-badali karke upyog kiya ja saktaa hai
 This allows the garbage collector to move the referenced objects and ensure its safety and security
 jaisaa ki C++ or kuch duusare object-unmukh bhashaaon main, java ke parivartaneey praathmik prakaar object nahin he
 The utility of the primary types is stored either directly in the fields or on the stack and not on the stack, as is generally true for objects
 java ke dijainron dwaara pradarshan ke kaaran liya gaya yah ek sajag nirnay tha
 Because of this, Java was not considered a pure object-oriented programming language
 jo kuch bhi ho, jaisaa ki java 5
0, swatah sanchaalan programmers ko aage badhane ke liye sakasham banaata he agar praathmik prakaarein unke aavaran shreniyon ke udhaaharan hote hai
 The syntax of Java is mostly derived from c ++
 C++, jisamen banaavat, kriyavidhi or kaarykram vaakya vinyas ko jodatii hai usase alag java ko keval ek object-unmukh bhashaa ke rup main banaaya gaya tha
 All the code is written within a class and everything is an object; Except for types of intrinsic data, which are not classes for performance reasons
 java kai visheshtaon ko claason ke liye, chhupaati he aisa vah bhashaa ko saral banane or swaabhaavik trutiyon or anadarsh rachana ko rokane ke liye karti he
 Java uses a review method similar to c ++
 do vibhinn prakaar kii samikshaayen hai: ekarekheey style ankan do forward slashes ke saath or ek bahurekhiy style khuli forward slash esterisk ke saath or band ek esterisk forward slash ke saath
 Examples: paramparanusaar 
java pratyay lagaakar udhaahranswarup helloworld
java strot filon kaa namakaran public class hota he
 It should be compiled into a bytecode using the Java compiler, first by producing a file named helloworld
class
 uske baad hi ise karyanvit yaa "nishpadit" kiya ja saktaa he
 The Java source file may contain only one public class but may contain fewer multiple classes than public access and any number of public inner classes
 ek class jise private ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he, use kisi bhi 
java file main sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file
 class file kaa naam class kaa naam he, 
class sanlagnit ke saath
 class file peedhee ke liye, namarahit claason is tarah prabandhit hoti hai jaise ki unka naam unke sanlagnit class ke naam kaa sangyojan tha, ek $, or ek purnank
 The key word public indicates that a system can be invoked by code in other classes, or classes can be used by classes outside the class hierarchy
 class padanukram nirdeshika ke naam se sambandhit hota he jisamen java file rahata he
 The key word next to a system static refers to a positional system that is only associated with the class, not any other specific instance of that class
 sirf sthitik pranaliyaan kisi object ko sandarbh kiye bina aamantrit kii ja sakati hai
 Positional systems cannot access any variable system that is not static
 mukhya shabd void sanketit karata he ki mukhya pranali collar ko koi mulya waapas nahin karata
 agar ek java program galat code ke saath baahar nikalne ko he, yah spashtatya zarur System
exit ko bulaaegaa
 The system name "main" is not a key word in the Java language
 yah sirf pranali kaa naam he jise java nirmaataa kaarykram ko niyantran badhaane ke liye bulaata he
 Java classes that run in managed environments such as applets and enterprise Java beans do not require or use the main system
 a Java program can contain multiple classes that have main systems, which means that the VM must be explicitly telling which class to launch from

html String] objectos kii sarini ko zarur sweekaar kare
 paramparanusaar, yah args ke rup main sandarbhit hota he yadhyapi koi bhi kanoonee pahchaan vaala naam istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Since the time of Java 5, the main system can also use changed devices, as public static void I, allowing the main system to invoke with an arbitrary number of string devices
 is vaikalpik ghoshnaa kaa prabhaav shabdarthtah pahchaan yogya he, lekin yah sarini ko banane or badhaane ke liye vaikalpik vaakya vinyas ko anumati detii he

 The applet tag has three installed properties: code = "hello", specifies the name of the japplet category and width = "200" height = "200" establishes the width and height of the applet's pixel
 aplates ko objects yaa embed avyav kaa istemaal karte hue HTML main bhi antahsthapit kiya ja saktaa hai yadhyapi web brouzar dwaara in avyavon ke liye samarthan asangat hai
 Whatever, the applet tag is allowed, so the object tag takes precedence wherever it belongs
 host aplication, vishesh rup se web broujar, Hello aplate ko drushtaant detii he or aplate ke liye ek ]docs / api / java / applet / appletcontext

 For container classes as an example, this is a problem because there is no simple way to construct a container that only accepts particular types of objects
 yaa to container class athwa antarfalak, saamanyatya object ke upaprakaron par sanchaalan karata he, yaa vibhinn container class har contand class ke liye nirmit hota he
 Generics allow compile-time type checking without having to build a large number of container classes, each with almost identical pointers
