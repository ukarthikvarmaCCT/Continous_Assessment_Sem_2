 fishan dizine kapadon or accesrij par dizine or saundarya ko saakaar karne kii kala he
 Fashion designs are influenced by cultural and social behavior and have changed over time and place
 
 fishan diziner kapade or upsaadhan dizine karne main vibhinn tareekon se kaam karte hai
 Some designers work alone or in some groups
 ve sundar tareeke se dizine kiye kapadon ke prati upabhokta kii ichha ko santusht karte hai or chunki dizine ke pashchaat kapadey ko bazaar tak aane main samay lag jaataa he isliye ve kai baar upabhokta kii pasand kaa purvanumaan bhi karte hai
 In fact, some designers are so prestigious that they determine the trend of fashion
 fishan diziner prayaas karte hai ki unke banaaye hue kapade sirf upyogita kii drushti se hi nahin balki dikhne main bhi achche lagen
 unhen is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie, vah kapadaa koun pehnegaa or use kin maukon par pahana jaayegaa
 unke paas kaam karne ke liye kapadon kii vistrut shrankhla or saamagree kaa sangyojan hota he or iske saath hi rangon, namoonon or shaileyon kii bhi vistrut shrankhla hoti he
 Although most of the everyday clothes fall under the traditional style category, there are a few different types of dresses for certain occasions, such as evening dresses or party attire
 kuch kapade vyakti vishesh ke liye banaaye jate hai, jaise ki hot kochar yaa of-da-rack
 aajkal zyaadaatar kapade aam janata ke liye banaaye jate hai, khaas kar ki aaramdaayak or rozmarra main pahane jane vaale kapade
 Fashion designers can work in many ways
 fishan diziner kisi ek fishan ke liye purna taur par kaam kar sakate hai, jinhen 'in-house-dizineron' ke naam se janaa jaataa he jo dizine kaa adhikaar apane paas rakhte hai
 They can work alone or with a group
 Freelance designers work for themselves, selling their designs to fashion houses, directly to shops or to textile manufacturers
 vastro par vastra nirmaataaon kaa label hota he
 Some fashion designers develop their own labels and market their designs under that
 kuch fishan diziner swarojgari hote hai or vyaktigat graahakon ke liye dizine karte hai
 Other high fashion designers cater to the needs of specialty stores or high-fashion department stores
 ye diziner moulik vastra to banaate hi hai or saath hi aise vastra bhi jo ki fishan ke chalan ke anuroop hote hai
 Most fashion designers work for apparel manufacturers, also develop fashion designs for men, women and children from the general public
 bade nami diziner brands jaise ki kelvin clen, guchi yaa channel ke paridhaan, dizine nideshak ke disha-nirdesh ke antargat vyaktigat dizineron ke samooh dwaara dizine kiye jaate hai
 == Designing the Collection == The Fashion Collection is a compilation of garments made by the designers every season through which they showcase the high-end apparel and new vogue of the general category series
 yah mana jaataa he ki iske dwaara ve pichley ek yaa do sijan ke paridhaanon ko niojit rup se aprachlit bhi kar dete hai
 a fashion season is defined as either autumn / winter or spring / summer
 == vastra dizining ==fishan diziner alag alag tareekon se kaam karte hai
 Some draw drawings of their ideas on paper, while others adorn the fabric as a dress
 jab ek diziner apane banaaye toil ke kapade se banaayi gayi apni dizine kii fitting se puri tarah se santusht ho jaataa he / ho jaati he, tab vah ek peshewar swarup viksit karne vaale kii sahaayta se us dizine kaa vyahaarik praaroop kapade par banaata utaarata he
 The task of the pattern maker is very precise and difficult
 paridhaan kii fitting unki parishuddhi par nirbhar karti he
 Finally, a garment is made as a sample and tested on a model
 saadhaaran taur par fishan dizine 19 veen shatabdi main charles fredrick worth se shuru hua mana jaataa he, jo ki apane banaaye kapadon par apane naam kaa label lagane vaala pehla diziner tha
 Before Draper, Charles Frederick Worth, established his Maison Couture in Paris, clothing was designed and manufactured by mostly anonymous seamers and the concept of high fashion came from royal court robes
 worth kii safalataa aisi thi ki vah graahakon dwaara apni pasand bataaye jane kii jagah par vah khud unako bataata tha ki unhen kya pahananaa chahie jab ki us samay ke anya diziner graahakon ke bataane ke anusaar kaam karte the
 In fact, the word koshurier was first used to describe it
 shaikshik upyog main kisi bhi samay ke paridhaanon kaa adhyayan ham vesh dizine ke rup main karte hai jabaki 1858 ke baad nirmit kisi bhi kapadey ko ham fishan dizine ke antargat rakhte hai
 During this period many other design houses also hired painters to get the designs of garments painted
 ye chitra, jo kisi vaastavik paridhaan ko taiyaar karne se kaaphi saste the, graahakon ko dikhaae jane lage
 If the customer liked their design, they would get that garment ready at the customer's order and they would profit from the finished garment
 is prakaar, graahakon ke liye modelon par puraa vastra pesh karne ke bajaay dizineron dwaara taiyaar paridhaan dizine chitra kii parampara sasti sabit hui
 Clothing produced by textile manufacturers fall into three main categories, although they can be further divided into specific categories: 1950 ke dashak tak, adhikansh fishan paridhaan yaa to naap-nirmit yaa hot-kochar ke anusaar dizine kiye jate evam banaaye jate the, ek paridhaan ek vyakti-vishesh graahak ke liye dizine kiya jaataa tha
 a high-fashion apparel is manufactured on customer orders alone and is usually sewn with high-quality, expensive fabrics, often paying attention to specifics, often hand-crafted and time-consuming
 inaki saamagree kii laagat or banane main lagane vaale samay se kahin zyaada zaruri hoti he inaki dikhaawat-banaavat
 The ready-to-wear clothes lie between the mass market and the haute-couture
 ye vyaktigat graahakon ke liye nahin banaaye jate, par kapadon ke chunaav or naap-jokh main badi saavdhaanee barti jaati he
 These clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee their uniqueness, hence they are expensive
 pahanane-ko-taiyaar sankalan saadhaarant: har saal ek nishchit avadhi par chalane vaale fishan saptaah main fishan house dwaara pradarshit kiye jate hai
 It is held twice a year on an urban basis
 vartmaan main fishan udyog kii bikri jan-bazaar par bahut adhik nirbhar karti he
 The mass market caters to the needs of a wide range of customers, producing a considerable amount of ready-to-wear clothing according to standard measurements
 srujanaatmak rup se prayog kiya gaya sasta saamaan, vahan karne yogya fishan banaata he
 Mass market designers adopt ideologies established by renowned designers
 kisi moulik dizine ke praturup ko banane se pehle, aksar wo ye nishchit karne ke liye ki koi style kitni chalegi, ek sizan tak pratiksha karaten hai paisa or samay bachaane ke liye, ve saste vastron or saral utpaadan takneekon kaa upyog karte hai, jinka ki mashiinon dwaara aasaani se utpaadan kiya ja sake
 Therefore the end-product can be sold much more cheaply
 ek dizine hoti he jise kaha jaataa he "kisch dizine" joki german shabd "kishen" se nikali he yani ki badsoorat yaa jisamen ki saundarya bodh na ho
 Kisch can also be explained in another way, "something that has run out of time or is no longer in fashion
" isliye yadi aap ek aisi pant pahanen he jo ek baar 80 ke dashak main pahani thi, vah "kisch" fishan style kahalaayegi

 fishan dizineron ko sabase zyada rojgaar dene vaale udyog- paridhaan, footkar saamaan or sankalpana main, ausat vaarshik aay 52860 dollar thi
 Many professional fashion designers begin by specializing in one particular area of fashion
 bazaar jitna chota or vishisht hoga, company dwaara apane paridhaanon ko ek sahi aakaar or bhav de paane kii sambhaavna utani hi zyada hogi
 If a company is known by a particular type of product rather than individual products, then it is easy to make its mark in this industry
 ek baar ek fishan company sthapit ho jaye, to phir vah nae kshetra main vistaar karne kaa faisla kar sakati he
 If the firm has made a name for the clothes it makes, it helps them to sell new types of clothes
 aamtaur par company ke liye surakshit hota he ki vah unhi kshetron main vistaar kare jisaki use jaankaree he
 For example, the designer of women's sportswear can expand into men's sportswear

 Middle Earth is a fictional continent mentioned in this novel which is surrounded by seaside
 iske pashchim main ek or mahadweep he, jiskaa naam valinore he
 Valinor is the land of gods where humans cannot go
 kahani shuru hoti he madhya dharti main ek shaitan kaale rakshas se, jiskaa naam tha souron or jo kaale jaadu main maahir tha
 At the end of the first era, Sauron escapes defeat by the gods of his demonic boss Morgoth Melkor
 duusare yug main souron duniya kaa badshaah banane ke sapane sanjone lagata he
 For this, he went to the Gandharvas by making a beautiful disguise of the owner of the gifts, and made many magical rings by deceitfully luring the chiefs of their blacksmiths Kalembrimbor and other blacksmiths
 lekin rahasyamayi or gupt tareeke se usne swarna kii ek or anguthi swayan banaayi : wo ek anguthi 
 In this, he filled all the evil and magical power of the world
 wo ek anguthi baaki sabhi angoothiyon kii swamini thi or usko pahanane vaala baki sabhi anguthi pahanane waalon ko apana ghulaam bana saktaa tha
 This plan fails when the Gandharvas discover this deception and take off three rings they have made for themselves
 souron gandharvon ye yuddh karne baaki sari anguuthiyaan chin letaa he
 Sauron gave seven rings to the warlords of the dwarves and nine to the warlords of humans
 gandharvon ne apni teen anguuthiyaan bachaa kar chupa leen
 Dwarves were not particularly affected by rings due to their internal magic, but humans were affected
 anguthi pahanane vaale nau insaan kuch hi saalon main shaitani pret ban gayi or ant tak souron ke vafaadaar naukar bane rahe
 r-farajoun, the king of the island of Numanor, comes to take possession of Middle Earth and takes Sauron captive to Numanor
 ulte vahaan souron raja ko phusalaakar use dushtataa ke raste le jaataa he or numenore dweep or lagbhag sabhi numenoravasiyon kaa sarvanaash kara detaa he
 Some good Noomanori humans escape to the middle ground and settle in a new civilization: the Kingdom of Gondor
 idhar amar souron ek doosraa rup lekar vaapis madhya bhoomi pahunchataa he, baaki numenoriyon ko khatm karne
 At this time Gandharva and humans form a friendship organization and together defeat Sauron and his army of demons
 numenoriyon kaa yuvaraj isildur alendil apane mrit pita kii tuuti hui talvaar narsil se souron kii ungali katkar usase wo ek anguthi chin letaa he or souron kaa jismani vajood khatm kar detaa he
 Sauron's spirit runs away elsewhere
 is tarah tisare yug kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Now it was the duty of Isildur, the new king of the Numenorois, to put that one ring in the burning lava in the mountain of destruction, which was a volcano, because there was no other way to destroy this evil ring and its master
 lekin us ek anguthi kii apni ek jaadui chahat thi, kisi tarah apane swami souron ke paas vaapis jane kii
 With the effect of that magic ring, Isildur did not destroy it but kept it with him
 baad main kuch daityon ne use maar daalaa or uskaa shav nadi main gira diya
 In this way, that devilish ring was lost in water, for a whole era
 ye sari kahani zyaadaatar da silmerilon upanyaas main zikr he
 The Hobbit novel describes a human-like race called the Hobbit
 hobit shantipriy nanhen insaan hote the, lagbhag bunon ke kad jitne
 Once upon a time, she gets a ring in the hands of an excluded hobbit named Gollum
 gollum ko wo shaitani anguthi ek pagal, bhadde or dusht jaanavar-numa jeev main tabadil kar detii he
 Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, somehow gets that demonic ring from Gollum during his exciting journey
 bilbo ke budhaape se da lord of da rings upanyaas kii kahani shuru hoti he
 That satanic ring was not a root or unconscious thing, but it had a desire for itself, a desire
 anguthi apana alpakaalik swami khud hi chunati thi, jisase ki wo apane sahi maalik souron ke paas vaapis pahunch sake
 If anyone wore that ring in their finger, it would disappear from the eyes of the world
 kuch vaqt baad souron pretatma ke rup main vaapis mordor kii shaitani minar barad-dur main vaapis aa gaya
 He took the form of a huge eye, surrounded by fire and always looking for that ring
 agar koi vyakti wo ek anguthi pahane to ye talash tej ho jaati thi or pahanevaale kaa ata-pataa souron ko kuch-kuch mahasoos hone lagata tha
 If there was a Nazgul nearby at that time, he would immediately know the ring wearer
 anguthi ko pahanane vaala to jaise use pahanakar kisi duusari hi dhundhali duniya main pahunch jaataa tha
 That person used to look dull, but hearing power was very fast
 kabhi kabhi aise halaat main souron or pahananevaale ko ek duusare kii jhalak bhi dikh jaati thi
 Moreover, the ring bearer used to get addicted to this ring and he got a strange bond with this ring
 wo anguthi shuddh sone kii bani thi or usamen koi ratna nahin judaa tha
 Mordor's diabolical language in his inner merger wrote: da lord of da rings--da fallowship of da ring is silsile kii pehali kadi thi
 The protagonist of this series is Frodo Baggins, a hobbit from a small village named Shire
 frodo bilbo bagins kaa bhatija tha
 Note that while introducing his genius, Tolkien not only composed an entire mythological saga, but also composed at least two new Kritrim languages: especially the classical language of the Gandharvas, the Quenya and their lingua sindarin

 1
 First chapter jab bilbo ne apni 111veen saalagirah par sanyas lene kii thaanee, to wo ek anguthi usne frodo ko baaki zaaydaad ke saath visasat main de di
 At that time, one of the many magicians, the old magician Gandalf, suspected that the gold ring was a lost satanic ring
 gandalf kaa shaq sahi niklaa
 At the same time Sauron came to know from Gollum that the ring was in the Poet
 souron ne turant nau bhayanak nazgul shaayar ko ravaanaa kiye
 On the other hand, Gandalf gave Frodo and his friend Sam Gamzy the responsibility of taking the ring out of the shire and taking it to Revendale, where the king of one of the Gandharva community lived, Alrond
 raste main frodo or sam ko unke rishtedaar meriadock brandybak or peregrin tuk bhi unke saath ho liye
 Gandalf did not meet them in the nearby city, as he had promised
 par vahaan frodo ko bache-khuche numenoriyon kaa sardaar aragorn zarur mila, jisane unki kaafii madad kii
 On the way to Rivendale, the Nazguls attack Frodo on the Weathertop Hill, and upon not giving the ring, Nazrul Sardar Angmar's dynasty injures Frodo with a poisonous magical talwar
 ek anya gandharv kii madad se frodo revendel pahunchaa jahaan uskaa ilaaj hua

 Second Chapter udhar gandailf jaaduugaron ke sardaar saruman da hwite se anguthi ke bare main salaah lene isenguard main orthank kii minar main gaya
 In his own naivety, Saruman told all the truth
 lekin saruman ke dil main shaitaniyat or laalach bhar chuki thi
 He imprisons Gandalf on top of the tower and begins to form his own army of demons - Uruk Hai, who is not affected by daylight
 gandai orthank se bhaag nikal kar revendel pahunchaa
 At Rivendale, Elrond convened a council consisting of representatives of all the free breeds of Middle Earth
 vahaan frodo kii shuruyaat par ye faisalaa sunaaya gaya ki frodo angoothivahak banegaa or es ek anguthi ko mordor jaakar qayamat ke pahaad main lave ke dariye main phenk degaa, jisase anguthi or souron nestanabood ho jaayen
 The friendship of the ring was made for all of these, including: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas and Gimli
 maitri ne karadhras parvat shikhar ke darre se mordor kii taraf nikalne kii koshish kii, lekin chetanayukta karadhras ne unako rasta nahin diya 
 With no other road to friendship, he had to change the course and go through the mine of Moriya
 vahaan ek kaale agnidanav ballrog se ladate hue gandai khan kii gaharaiyon main gir gaya
 From there, this friendship went to another city of Gandharvas: Lothalorian, where Frodo saw some glimpses of his difficult future in the mirror of Gandharvarani Galadriel
 iske baad mahanadi anduin main naavon ke zariye ye log gondor kii seemaa main chale gayi

 Buddha's real name was Siddhartha
 unka janm kapilwastu ke paas lumbini main hua tha
 In this place, Emperor Ashoka built a pillar in the memory of Buddha in the third century BC
 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh
 siddharth gautam jab bees varsh ke huye to unhone bhi shakyasang kii sadsyta grahan kii or shakyasang ke niyamanusaar siddharth ko shakyasang kaa sadsy bane huye aath varsh vyateet ho chuke the
 He was a very devoted and firm member of the Sangh
 sangh ke maamalon main ve bahut ruchi rakhte the
 His conduct as a member of the Sangh was an example and he made himself dear to everyone
 sangh kii sadsyta ke aathven varsh main ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shuddhodan ke parivaar ke liye dukhad ban gayi or siddharth ke jivan main sankatpurna sthiti paidaa ho gayi
 Adjacent to the kingdom of the Shakyas was the kingdom of the Kolis
 rohni nadi donon rajyon kii vibhaajak rekha thi
 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul

 In the definition of pure science, it is called samashti
 usase jin anek vyashti bhaavon kaa janm hota he, uski sangya gana he
 Ganapati or Ganesh is also known as Mahātattattva
 jo nishkalarup se sarvavyaapak ho vahi ganpati he
 His coming into the house or taking a separate form is a creation of consciousness
 samshti or vyashti donon ek duusare se avinabhoot yaa mili hue rahete he
 The same relation is indicated by the trunk of Ganesha
 hathi kaa mastak mahat yaa mahaan kaa pratik he or ankhu yaa chuha parthit vyashti padaarthon yaa kendron kaa pratik he
 He is the animal of Ganapati in the language of Purana

 eps Solo gunasutra yaa chromosome sabhi vanaspatiyon va praaniyon kii koshikaon main paye jane vaale tantu rupi pind hote hai, jo ki sabhi anuvaanshik gunon ko nirdhaarit va sanchaarit karte hai
 The number of chromosomes in each species remains fixed
 maanav koshika main gunasutron kii sankhya 46 hoti he jo 23 ke jode main hote he
 Of these, 22 chromosomes are identical in male and female and homologous to their pairs
 inhen sammilit rup se samajaat gunasutra kehete he
 The chromosomes of the 23rd pair are not the same between men and women, which are called heterogeneous chromosomes
 gunasutra kii sanrachana main do padaarth visheshat: sanmilit rahete hai- DNA is the only genetic material
 di e na e anu kii sanrachana main chaar carbonic samaakshar sammilit hote hai : do purine, do pirimidine, ek chini-dioxyribose or phosforic amla 
 Purine contains adenine and guanine, and pyrimidine has thymine and cytosine
 di en e ke ek anu main do sutara hote hai, jo ek duusare ke chaaron or sarpil rup main valayit hote he
 Each DNA formula consists of one or more of the four organic cells in this sequence - thymine, cytosine, adenine, and guanine, and they are interconnected in a particular way
 in chaar samaakshaaron or unase sambandhit sharkara or phophoric amla anu kaa ek ekak tetraneucliotid hota he or kai sahastra tetraneucliotidon kaa ek di en e anu banataa he
 The reason for the variation of DNA of different beings is the difference in the sequence of cells
 di en e or aisa hi ek doosraa newcliik amla aar en e carbonic samaakshar kii upasthiti ke kaaran parabangnee ko adhikansh 2,600 angstrom ke kshetra main antarleen karte hai
 On this basis, a quantitative quantitative arrival of DNA is made
 praaniyon main do vishesh prakaar ke centresutra paae jate hai
 One is found in some dipterra insecta in the nuclei of the ovarian ligaments
 ye gunasutra usee jati ke saadhaaran gunasutron kii apeksha kai sau gune lambey or chaude hote hai
 For this reason, they are called Mahagunasutra
 inaki sanrachana saadhaaran samasutran or ardhasuthran centresutron se kuch bhinn dikhaai padati he
 Here, instead of one chromosome, a transverse line consists of granules that have more ability to stain
 gunasutra ke ek chor se duusare tak bahut si aisi anuprastha pankti kii sab kanikas ek samaan hoti hai or anya panktiyon kii kanikaon main visheshtaayen or vibhinnataayen hoti he
 As these chromosomes are very long, it is believed that they are completely desensitized and perhaps there is some elongation of the protein
 adhik chaude hone ke kaaran yah he ki ek gunasutra apane samaan ek duusare cendrak-tra kaa sanshleshan karata he
 At the time of samasutraana in ordinary state, these two sutras separate from each other, but in the Mahagunasutra it does not
 donon sutara ek duusare se jude hi rah jate hai
 The number of the Mahagunasutra is half that of the ordinary chromosome, as each sutra is paired with another sutra like it
 is ghatana ko daihik yugman kehete hai
 Another odd chromosome is also found in animals
 isak lampbrush gunasutra kehete hai
 These chromosomes are found in the nuclei of the eggs of animals that have high amounts of eggs, such as fish, amphibians, eggs, birds etc
 gunasutra saadhaaran diplotine-dyakinisis gunasutron ke samaan do do yugmit sutron ke bane hote hai
 Both paired sutras are connected to each other in some places and are far away from each other in other places
 in jodon ko kiesma samajha jaataa he
 On each sutra, which is called chromonima, there are granules of different lamination in place, which are called chromimiers
 prayek chromomier se ek jodi yaa adhik parshvapash jude hue hote he
 The lateral side is also made of a formula similar to chromonema, but the ribonucleo-protein corpuscles are gathered around it, making these formulas appear thick
 chromomier bhi chromonima se santat hote hai
 The nuclei are produced on a particular chromosome
 adhikansh jantuon kii prayek koshika main gunasutron ke do ekatm kulak hote hai
 a clan remains in the mature larynx
 aise praani or koshikaaye dwiganit kahi jaati hai, parantu kuch praaniyon, visheshat: paudhon, main do se adhik kulak gunasutron ke hote hai yah bahugunit kahe jate hai
 If the centrosome of a diploid animal is doubled, so that each of the sutras in its cells is like four, then such a creature is called an autopolyploid
 yadi kisi dwiguneet sankar ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to aise praani ko allopoliploid kehete hai
 If a diploid animal, whose centrosomes are K1a1b1b1c1c1, etc
, is hybridized to another animal, whose chromosomes are K2a2b2b2c2c2, etc
, then its offspring will have chromosome A1a2b1b2c1c2 etc
 k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ityadi ek duusare se bhinn honge or inamen saadhaarant: yugman nahin hoga
 If the chromosomes of this creature are doubled, then in their cells A1a1a2a2; b 1 b 1 b 2 b 2; C1 c1 c2 c2, etc
 will have chromosomes
 yah allopoliploid kaha jayega
 Polyploids may also have more than four kulaks
 yah spasht he ki autopoliploid main zaigotin avasthaa main chatu:sanyojak utpann ho jaayange, kyonki prayek prakaar ke chaar chaar gunasutra upasthit hai or chaar sutron ke yugman se ek chatu:sanyojak banataa he
 At the time of cell division each pole will not get equal number of chromosomes
 praaia: aisa hota he ki ek chatu:sanyojak ke tuutane se kisi dhruv par teen sutara pahunche or uske sanmukh dhruv par ek hi sutara pahunche
 The offspring cells formed at the end of cell division will either have more chromosomes or fewer, and such imbalance results in the cell's death
 isi kaaran autotetraploid bahut kam urvar hote hai
 Autotetraploid plants are much larger than ordinary diploid plants and their seeds are also very large, so that they can prove more beneficial for the householder even when fertility is low
 thandhak pahunchaakar, yaa kuch alkelidon ke prabhaav se, paudhe atopoliplide banaae ja sakate hai
 The conditions are opposite in allotetraploids
 yadi donon aadim matapita ke sutara ek duusare se purna rup se vibhinn hon to allopoliplide kriyaatmak rup se dwiguneet he or purna rup se urvar hoga
 For example, if the formulas in a hybrid are completely different from those of K1a2, B1b2, C1c2, then such a hybrid will be sterile, but this state will be changed by doubling its chromosomes
 aisi koshikaon main k1 k1 k2 k2, kha1 kha1 kha2 kha2, ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2 ityadi sutara honge or jin shakhaon main aisi koshikaaye hongi unpar phool lagenge, kyonki aisi koshikaon main miotic vibhaajan safal hoga, k1 k1 se yugmit hoga, kha1 kha1 se ityadi
 The dhatura stramonium has 12 pairs of chromosomes in the diploid state and becomes bivalent at the time of meiosis
 iske autopoliploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra hote he or ardhasuthran ke samay 12 chatu:sanyojak banate hai
 Similarly, the plant diploid from Primula sinensis has 12 pairs of chromosomes and the autotetraploid has 48 formulas and at the time of meiosis it has 9 to 11 quadruple connectives and 2 to 6 are divalent
 solemon likopersicon ke dwiguneet main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or uske autotetraploid main 12 chatushk gunasutra
 These are all plants
 kripis rubra aura kripis foetida main 5 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 Their formulas do not differ much from each other and in hybrids resulting from their hybridization, 5 bisects are formed at the time of meiosis
 iske allopoliploid main 20 ken drakasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran main 0 se 5 chatu:sanyojak banate hai or 0 se 10 dwisanyojak
 It is clear that allotetraploids will not be very fertile
 primmula floribanda or primmula resticileta donon main hi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare ke praaia: samaan hote hai
 The hybrids that they make from their hybridization are known as primateza kivensis
 isamen bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai
 At the time of meiosis, the coupling is successful and 9 bisectors are formed
 sutron ke dvigun hone se jo allopoliplide banataa he usamen 9 chatushk sutara hote hai or aise paudhe main 12 se 18 tak dwisanyojak banate hai or 0 se 3 tak chatu:sanyojak
 It is clear that the number of quadrilateral is very small and sometimes not a single quadrant is formed
 muuli or karamkalla main se prayek main 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai, jo ek duusare se purnat: bhinn hote hai
 The hybrid Raphanus brassicae resulting from their hybridization also has 9 pair of chromosomes; But in meiosis, a single bisector is not formed, because the coupling action is not successful and all the formulas remain unpaired, making 12 unicellular
 iske sutara dvigun se utpann elotetraploid main 12 jodi sutara hote hai or ardhasuthran main 12 sanyojak banate hai, chatu:sanyojak ek bhi nahin
 The result is that raphanus-brassica-allatetraploid is very fertile, although raphanus-brassica-diploid is sterile
 jantuon main poliploidi bahut kam pai jaati he par yah anishekajanit jantuon main bahudhaa pai jaati he
 Many new species in plants may have arisen due to polyploidy
 iskaa pramaan isse miltaa he ki angiousparmon kii lagbhag aadhi jatiyaan aisi he jinke paripakv yugmakon ke gunasutron kii sankhya kisi sambandhit jati ke yugmakeey gunasutra kii sankhya kii guneet he
 There are many varieties of wheat
 in jatiyon kii mul yugmakeey cendraksutra sankhya 7 he
 The number of chromosomes is found to be 14, 21,42 and 49 multiplied by 7 among the wheat species
 isi bhanti tambaakoo kii bhinn bhinn jatiyon main gunasutron kii sankhya 12 athwa 12 kii guneet 24 hoti he
 Many polyploids have been formed by use in plants, which have two clusters of unitary formulas
 ye urvar hote hai
 There is no doubt that cytoplasm functions under the control of the nucleus

 For example, the exocrine cells of the pancreas produce special digestive enzymes
 gud kii nalika kii koshikaaye rudhir se uria nikaal leti hai or yakrut kii koshikaaye glucose ko glikojan main parinat karke ekmit kar leti hai
 It is clear that in every cell of any creature, all its genes are normally present

 hindi shabdhsagar hindi bhashaa ke liye banaaya gaya ek brihat shabd-sangrah tathaa pratham maanak kosh he
 'hindi Shabdasagar' was built by the Nagari Pracharini Sabha, Kashi
 iskaa pratham prakaashan 1922-1929 ke bich hua
 This scientific and methodical dictionary was originally composed in four sections
 iske pradhan sampadak shyamsundar das the tathaa baalkrishna bhatta, lala bhagavanadin, amir singh evam jaganmohan verma sahasampadak the
 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Acharya Ramchandra Varma also contributed best in this great work

 Later, between 1965–1976, its revised edition was published in 11 volumes

 In the editing of this Mahakosh with the consideration of means and circumstances, the masters of the assembly and the activists of the dictionary got great success
 isaki kuch uplabdhiyaan he jo stuty or abhinandaneey hai
 It can also be said that this Mahakosh was the staple and base of all the small and large shells of the Hidi, which became interchangeable with the Hindi word
 hindi koshkala ke labdhpratishth sampadak shri ramchandra verma ke is prashansaneey kaary kaa upjivy bhi mukhyatah hindi shabdhsagar hi he
 Its original form is mostly calculated from the words in the form of elemental
 hindi ke anya koshon main bhi adhikansh saamagree isi kosh se lee gai he
 Like most of the earlier Hindi dictionaries, the Hindi word ocean was not created by one person but was created by many suddis penetrating language and literature
 shabdasankalan ke liye keval puraane koshon kaa hi aadhaar na lekar granthon or vyavhaaryukt bhashaa or boliyon ke praayah samast uplabdh saamaanya or vishesh shabdon ke sangrah kaa usame prayaas hua
 Often attempting to see the original source of each word, along with trying to direct various linguistic sources
 vyutpattiyaan yadhyapi bahut-si aisi hai jo sandigdh or bhraamak athwa kahin kahin ashuddh bhi hai tathaapi uske liye yathasaadhan or yathashakti jo prayaas he vah bhi apane aapme bada mahatva rakhata he
 a very mature appropriation of grammatical system and systematic instruction of words and meanings is seen in the Hindi dictionary
 paryaay-nirdesan par jahaan ek ore sanskrit koshon kaa vyapak prabhaav he or praayah adhikadhik yogic pado kaa ullekh bhi sanskrit vyakaran par adhiktah aadhaarit he vahaan duusari ore hindi kii prakruti or prayog-parampara kaa akalan or sankalan bhi bade ytn or manoyog ke saath kiya gaya he
 Interpretation of the meanings from the idiom and proverbs of Hindi idioms and proverbs or the use of rituals is also sufficiently mature in this
 shabdhsagar main arthnirdhaaran main vyaakhyaatmak paddati apanaai gai he
 But at the same time most synonyms have also been placed under the key words
 is kaaran kabhi kabhi aisa bhi lagata he ki yah kosh aadhunik dhang kaa paryaayavachi or nanarthak kosh ek saath ban gaya he
 Under the explanatory method, many types of introduction and description of the person, subject, object, etc
, mythological, historical, classical and traditional, are given in place
 is kaaran yah kosh vishwakosh, gyaanakosh, charitkosh or paribhaashik kosh ke parivesh kaa bhi yatra-tatra sparsh karata dekhai detaa he
 Some deficiencies can also be counted in this
 shabdon ke samast arthon kii prayogpushti or pramanikta ke nimit sarvatra udhaaharan nahin hai
 Wherever they are, nominal texts are often specified
 unek prasangsthal or sanskaran kaa ullekh nahin he
 Self-made examples of colloquialism have also been employed at many sites
 sab milakar isamen shabdasangrah or arthvivruti donon kii paridhi ko yathasambhav vyapak or vistrut banaaya gaya he
 In this area, the importance of this dictionary has increased greatly due to the combination of vocabulary stored with various professions and class life

 The Bhoodan movement was a voluntary land reform movement started in 1951 by Sant Vinoba Bhave
 vinoba kii koshish thi ki bhoomi kaa punarvitaran sirf sarkari kanoonon ke jariye nahin ho, balki ek andolan ke madhyam se isaki safal koshish kii jaae
 In order to make the Bhoodan movement a success in the fifties of the 20th century, Vinoba used ideas such as creative works and trusteeship, following Gandhian ideas
 unhone sarvoday samaaj kii sthapana kii
 It was the All India Association of Creative Workers
 iskaa uddeshy ahimsaatmak tareeke se desh main saamaajik parivartan laana tha
 It was dated April 18, 1951, when Acharya Vinoba Bhave received the first donation of land
 unhen yah jameen telugana kshetra main sthit pochampalli gaanv main daan main mili thi
 This was the beginning of the same Bhoodan movement of Vinoba, which is now recorded in the pages of history or in the memory of the old people
 tab vinoba padayatraaen karte or gaanv-gaanv jaakar bade bhuswamiyon se apni jameen kaa kam se kam chatha hissaa bhudaan ke rup main bhoomihin kisaanon ke bich baantne ke liye dene kaa anurodh karte the
 It was then targeted to acquire five crore acres of land, which was one-sixth of the 30 million acres of cultivable land in India
 us vakt praja socialist party ke netaa jaiprakash narayan bhi 1953 main bhudaan andolan main shaamil ho gaye the
 In the early days of the movement Vinoba had traveled to around 200 villages in the Telangana region and received 12,200 acres of land in charity
 iske baad andolan uttar bharat main failaa
 Its deep impact was seen in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 march 1956 tak daan ke rup main 40 lakh acre se bhi adhik jameen bataur daan mil chuki thi
 But since then, the force of the movement was shattered
 1955 tak aate-aate andolan ne ek nayaa rup dhaaran kiya
 It was identified as 'gramdan'
 iskaa arth tha ‘sari bhoomi gopal kii’
 All the lands in the villages of Gramdan were considered as collective ownership, over which all had equal rights
 isaki shuruyaat urisa se hui or ise kaaphi safalataa mili
 By 1960 there were over 4,500 Gramdan villages in the country
 inamen 1946 gaanv urisa ke the, jabaki maharashtra duusare sthaan par tha
 There were 603 Gramdan villages
 kaha jaataa he ki gramdaan vaale vichaar unheen sthanon par safal hue jahaan varg bhed ubhare nahin the
 That area was tribals only
 par badi ummiido ke baavjood saath ke dashak main bhudaan or gramdaan andolan kaa bal kamjor pad gaya
 In public opinion its creative abilities could not be generally used
 daan main mili 45 lakh acre bhoomi main se 1961 tak 8
72 lakh acre jameen garibon va bhoomihinon ke bich banti ja saki thi
 It is said that there were many reasons for this
 masalan- daan main mili bhoomi kaa acha-khaasaa hissaa kheti ke laayak nahin tha
 a lot of land was stuck in litigation, etc
 kul milakar ye baaten ab bhula di gai hai
 However, sometimes in the media, news about land found in Bhoodan keeps coming up
 acharya vinoba kaa bhudaan andolan logon ke jehan main rah gaya he
 In the opinion of experts, it was one of the first attempts after independence where land reforms were tried through constructive movement
 so logon ne badi koshishen kii hai, is samaaj ko aage laane kii
 Sadly, that effort remains stuck in political or official mazzaal

 It was considered to be necessary to spread the traditional dialogue in the public interest
 manovaigyanik pinkar sahaj yaa ataarkik maansik anubhav ko kora rudhiwaad samajhate hai
 But there are scientists for whom this mental experience is a challenge
 man main aise badlaav kaa aadhaar sangyaan kii do pranaaliyon, taarkik or ataarkik, main dekha ja saktaa he
 According to Obeyasekere, the cultivation of Gautama Buddha is a form of ritualistic dialogue that was prevalent in India at that time
 is paddati main, obeyesekere kehete hai, mahatma buddha ko gyaan prapti ataarkik aayam dwaara hui, parantu aadhunik vichaarak ise taarkik aayam se jodate hai
 Even during the time of Mahatma Buddha and even today, Obeyasekere writes further, the irrational dimension of dialogue with the natural elements was the main in the land of India, in which the penance of the deity, the personification by the divine element, and the enlightenment from him
 shimail kaa soofivaad ke sandarbh main “akl” or “ishk” main bhed, sangyaan ke do ayaamon, kramshah bauddhik or sahaj gyaan, ko ujagar karata he
 He has written in detail in his book that philosophers consider "aql" as the source of knowledge, but the Sufi saint Rumi gave more importance to the "ishq" or the worship of God than enlightenment to God, and considered Akal as its complement
 “dhur kii baani ai” kii dhun main sikh dharm ke anuyaayon or anya logon ko paraprakritik samvaad kaa sanket he, or aad guru granth sahib isi kaa sangrah he
 These dialogues started with the first Guru of the Sikhs, Sri Guru Nanak Dev ji, like other saints, they also gave importance to the natural feeling
 swami ramakrishna paramhans kii jeevani main aise prasangon kaa chithran bakhubi hua he
 The enlightened class at that time did not show interest in adopting this spontaneous stream of rural surroundings, dialogue with supernatural elements, Kali, Hanuman, Rama, etc
, but it gradually spread

 Devas or ghosts can occupy the consciousness of any person, and it is considered necessary to be diagnosed, for the diagnosis comes the priest, in which those spirits are called who make the diagnosis

 These views of James also raised questions
 madhyam kisi parivaar ke sadasyon kaa unke nikat sambandhi, jivit yaa mrit, se samvaad sthapit karata he
 Karl Yung's studies refer to the elaboration of dialogue from the natural elements
 kabhi-kabhi vyakti ke aatm kii jagah koi paraprakritik tatv le letaa he, saadhaaran bhashaa main ise daivi aavesh yaa bhoot laganaa kehete hai
 But psychiatrists place it in the category of psychiatry
 aise vyaktiyon main kabhi ek vyaktitav prabhavi hota he, to kabhi doosraa
 Persinger's experiments are also related to theistic communication, hypothesizing that the location of consciousness is different from the brain, and that the geomagnetic field is important
