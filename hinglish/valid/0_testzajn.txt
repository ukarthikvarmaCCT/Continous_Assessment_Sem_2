 isamen ek yaksha kii katha he jise kuber alakapuri se nishkasit kar detaa he
 The expelled Yaksha resides on the Ramagiri mountain
 varsha ritu main use apni premika kii yaad sataane lagati he
 Kamartha Yaksha thinks that it is not possible for him to return to Alkapuri by any means, so he decides to send his message through the messenger to the girlfriend
 akelepan kaa jivan guzaar rahe yaksha ko koi sandeshvahak bhi nahin miltaa he, isliye usne megh ke madhyam se apana sandesh virahaakul premika tak bhejne kii baat sochi
 In this way, the clouds rising on the sky on the first day of Ashada combined with Kalidasa's imagination, created a unique work
 meghdoot kii lokapriyata bhartiya sahitya main pracheen kaal se hi rahi he
 While famous commentators have written commentaries on it, many Sanskrit poets have written many ambitions inspired by it or based on it
 bhaavana or kalpana kaa jo udaatt prasar meghdoot main uplabdh he, vah bhartiya sahitya main anyatra viral he
 Nagarjuna, in the role of Meghdoot's Hindi translation, described it as a unique part of Hindi poetry
 meghdutam kavy do khandon main vibhakt he
 Yaksha in East Megh describes the cloud from Ramagiri to Alakapuri and in Yaksh in Uttaramegh it is the famous poignant message of Yaksha in which Kalidasa has poured out the spirit of love
 kuch vidwaanon ne is kriti ko kavi kii vyaktivyanjak rachana mana he
 There are about 115 verses in "meghdoot", although in different versions the number of these verses is also slightly more than manipulation
 dow es
 ke
 de ke matanusaar mul "meghdoot" main isse bhi kam 111 padya hai, shesh baad ke prakshep jaan padate hai
 Most of the thinkers believe that Kalidas has fixed a sad story of his life by making a message in Meghdoot
 hindi kavi nagarjun ke anusaar- The rainy season is the first day of the Ashadh month in the Kadekh Gagan, when the mind of the black cube-ghatvidur Yaksha was sent to the beautiful peak of Chitrakoot with folded hands, which was sent by the poor, who sent the message of the cloud of the cloud of the cloud of the Kaalidas! Be truly tired of the pain of the whole world and be amused by the peaks of amal-dhawal Giri! How long did you sleep? Yaksha cried or you cried? Kalidas! Tell the truth mahabharat ke "nalopakhyaan" naamak aakhyaan main nal tathaa damayanti dwaara isko doot banaakar paraspar sandash preshan kii jo katha ai he, vah bhi dootkavy kii parampara kaa hi anusaran he
 The poet, who, like "meghdoot", wrote in the Mandakranta stanza "parshvabhyudaya", a poem of four cantos related to the life of Tirthankar Parshvanath, which contains the centuries-old verse of Meghdoot as the legend of Meghd
 15veen shatabdi main "neminath" or "rajmati" vaale prasang ko lekar "vikram" kavi ne "nemidoot" kavy likhaa, jisamen meghudat" ke 125 padyon ke antim charnon ko samasya banaakar kavi ne neminath dwaara parityakt rajmati ke virah kaa varnan kiya he
 During this period, another Jain poet "charitra Sundar Gani" composed the Shantarasavakic Jain poetry "shiladoot"
 in do kritiyon ke atirikt vimalkirti kaa "chandradoot", agyaat kavi kaa "chetodoot" or meghavijay upaadhyaay kaa "meghdoot samasya" is parampara ke anya jain kavy hai
 3D holography is a static ray exposition device
 yah shabd unani, ὅλος holos yani purna + γραφή graphi yani lekhan yaa aarekhan se niklaa he
 In this technique, the light emanating from an object is subsequently recorded and reconstructed, giving the object the same position in the image relative to the recording medium of the object as it was at the time of recording
 ye chhavi dekhne vaale kii sthiti or orientesan ke anusaar vaise hi badalati prathit hoti he, jaisi ki us vastu ke upasthit hone par hoti
 Thus the unmarked image presents a 3D image and is called a hologram
 hologram kaa avishkaar british-hungarian bhautik vigyaani dainis gabar ne san 1947 main kiya tha, jise san 1960 main or viksit kiya gaya
 Subsequently it was put into industrial use
 iskaa upyog pustakon ke cover, credit card aadi par ek choti si roopahali chaukor pattee ke rup main dikhaai detaa he
 This is called hologram
 yah dekhne main triayami chhavi yaa tribimb prathit hoti he, kintu ye mul rup main dwiaiami akruti kaa hi hota he
 For this, when two two-dimensional figures are placed on top of each other
 takneekee bhashaa main ise superimpojishan kehete hai
 It also gives the illusion of depth to the human eye
 hologram ke nirmaan main atisookshm byore ankit hone aavashyak hote hai, atah isko lager prakaash ke madhyam se banaaya jaataa he
 Laser rays are of a particular wavelength
 kyonki hologram ko saamaanya prakaash main dekha jaataa he, atah ye vishesh tarangadairghy vaali lager kirane hologram ko chamkila bana detii hai
 Two different wavelength laser rays are plotted on a photographic plate to obtain images on a hologram
 isse pehle donon lager kirane ek beam sprader se hokar nikalati hai, jisase plate par leisure kirnon kaa prakaash flashlite kii bhaanti jaataa he or chitra ankit ho jaataa he
 This gives two images in one place
 yani ek hi aadhaar par lager prakaash ke madhyam se do vibhinn akritiyon ko is prakaar ankit kiya jaataa he, jisase dekhne vaale ko hologram ko alag-alag kone se dekhne par alag akruti dikhaai detii hai
 When the hologram is viewed by the human eye, it combines the two images and sends a signal to the brain, giving the brain the illusion of its being three-dimensional
 hologram taiyaar hone par usko chaandi kii maheen platon par mudrit kiya jaataa he
 These silver layers are made from deflected light
 hologram kii visheshta ye he ki isaki chori or nakal karnaa kaaphi jatil he, atah apni suraksha or swayan ko anya pratidwandiyon se alag karne ke liye vibhinn companiyaan apana hologram prayog kar rahi hai
 Counterfeit product can be easily identified using holograms
 bharat main hologram kii ek badi company holostic india limited he
 To identify counterfeit medicines, India's leading pharmaceutical company Glaxo has introduced the fever-reducing drug Crocin in a three-dimensional hologram pack
 yah parishkrut thri-di hologram bharat main pehla evam ekmaatr pidanashak anti payeretic brands he
 Famous Indian companies using holograms include Hindustan Unilever, Philips India, Ashok Leyland, Kirloskar, Hawkins
 iske alaava resham or synthetic kapadaa udyog ke liye holographic dhaagon ke utpaadan kii yojana bhi pragati par he1 hologram kam hota kharchila he or iske rahete utpaadon ke saath chhedchhad kii jaye to badi saralata se uskaa pataa lag jaataa he
 With its help, the credibility and uniqueness of the product are maintained
 iske alaava matadaata pahchaan patr aadi main bhi thri-di hologram kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For this, the Election Commission of India has also issued instructions
 bharat ke matadaata pahchaan patron main bhi hologram kaa prayog hota he
 Apart from this, hologram is also used to prevent theft of electricity on power supply meters

 For proper study of the organism, it is necessary that organisms with different properties and characteristics are placed in different categories
 is tarah se jantuon evam padpon ke vargeekaran ko vargiki yaa vargeekaran vigyaan angreji main vargiki ke liye do shabd prayog main laaye jate hai - texonomi tathaa systematics 
 Karl Linnaeus wrote the book Sistema Naturai based on the word Systematics in 1735 AD

 The first step of any kind of biological analysis is the classification of it in a systematic way; Therefore, the first step in studying a plant, or animal, is its naming, classification and then description
 vargiki kaa mul nirmaan aakaaraki yaa akritivigyaan, kriyavigyaan, paristhitiki or anuvanshiki par aadhaarit he
 Like other scientific disciplines, it is also a synthesis of many types of knowledge, opinions and systems, which are used in the field of classification

 Nowadays more than four lakh species of plants are known

 About 4,750 new castes are described every year

 upjatiyon ko milakar 20 lakh se adhik jantujatiyon ke naam gyaat hai or prati varsh lagbhag 10,000 nai jatiyon kaa varnan hota he
 The history of taxonomy is as old as human history

 Many ancient scholars of Greece, notably Hippocrates and Democritus, have ranked animals in their studies
 spasht rup se arestu ne apane samay ke gyaan kaa upyukt sankalan kiya he
 The beginning of classification appears in the mention of Aristotle
 inkaa mat he ki jantu apane rahan sahan ke dhang, swabhaav or shaareerik aakaar ke aadhaar par pruthak kiye ja sakate hai
 He mentions animal groups such as birds, fish, whale, insects, and has also used the words Coleoptera and Diptera for small groups

 John Ray was the first person in the field of genealogical experts to distinguish between caste and lineage, and was the first among ancient scientists to have a higher natural classification

 In the eighteenth century, the ideas of evolutionism had an impact on taxonomy

 At the same time, classification experts became very interested in animals from distant places
 ve dur deshon ke jaanwaron ke vishay main jaankaree karnaa chaahate the or parichit jaanwaron se unka sambandh karnaa chaahate the
 Hence, there were long voyages at this time
 dur dur ke jaanwaron kaa adhyayan kiya gaya or unke vansh tathaa kutumb aadi kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 One such voyage took place on a ship called Bigley which also included a naturalist named Charles Darwin

 Classification made in the twentieth century is characteristic of science
 haxli ke vicharanusaar aadhunik vargeekaran vigyaan bhugol, paristhitiki, koshiki or anuvanshiki aadi kaa sanshleshan he
 In earlier times, the basis of classification science was "types", which were presented with the help of natural traits
 aadhunik vargeekaran vigyaan main jatiyon kaa varnan purnataya akritik lakshanon par aadhaarit nahin he, jaivik he, jisaki vajah se bhugolic, paristhitik, jananeey tathaa kuch anya lakshanon par bhi dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Formal concept broadens the stability of ranges, increases the differences between each other and reduces variability

 Defining specific groups or categories by reverse means a definite method of classification
 linius ne aisi paanch shreniyan banaai thim : Each category consists of one or more lower level groups and they form the lower category
 isi tarah prayek kramik shrenee ek athwa ek se adhik unchi shrenee se sambandhit hoti he
 These ranges form a comprehensive system by decreasing natural discernment
 gyaan ke vikaas ke saath saath in shreniyon kii sankhya badhati gai
 Between the world and the class, between the union and the gana and the dynasty, categories called kutumb were added
 linius ke vicharanusaar prajati ek vaikalpik shrenee he, jiske antargat bhugolic athwa vyaktigat vibhinnata aati he
 In this way, the following seven categories are now: vargeekaran kii or adhik parishuddh vyakhya ke liye in shreniyon ko bhi vibhajit kar anya shreniyan banaai gai hai
 Mostly these categories are named by adding prefixes or sub prefixes before the original name
 udaahranarth, adhigan or upagan aadi
 Many names were proposed for higher categories, but they are not in common use
 keval aadim jati kaa kutumb or vansh ke bich prayog kiya jaataa he
 Some authors, such as Simpson, have used the name cohort between gana and class

 However, it has not yet been approved in the codes

 Apart from this, there is a slight difference in the categories of classification of zoology and botany)

 Under this theory, Cooley says that society is like a mirror
 vyakti apane aapako vaise hi banataa he jaise samaaj main wo jaataa he
 Just as a man or woman gazes in the mirror and gazes repeatedly and sees whether she is ready to dress in the same way or not, it means that she is in accordance with the society in which she is going

 According to Vishnu Purana the human hand dimensions are as follows: - vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparokt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he:- This is not explained in detail
 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 It is said that once the builder, the engineer, 'katle', failed, when he got it again, he again sat under the bridge before releasing water into the canal, so that if divinely failed again If it is, then it will also be settled there itself
 jansamooh saans thame dekhtaa rahaa or pareekshan kii safalataa par atyant harsith hua
 Masonry grinds are suitable only where they are able to provide a firm, dependable base and reinforce the foundation
 aadhunik pareekshanon se siddh ho chukaa he ki paryaapt uthaan or motiwali daat yadi sudrudh aadhaar par ho or thik se dekhbhaal hoti rahe, to kaaphi bhaar le sakati he
 Due to the arrangement of masonry in the masonry, necessary adjustment occurs according to the change of temperature and internal stress or contraction stress is not produced
 antayadharon main bhi maamuli chaal hone se baari haani nahin hoti
 The base of masonry bridges is the principle of stopper, in which the load appears as a thrust in conflicting directions
 is thel kii rekha ko "raikhik daat' kehete hai, jo sthayitv kii drushti se daat ke challe ke madhyavarti tritiyansh main honi chahie
 The last stone in the stopper is called the key
 chaabi lagane ke pashchaat dhula, jisapar daat lagaate samay uskaa sara bhaar tikaa rahata he, kuch nicha kar diya jaataa he, jisase daat baith jaae or usamen dabaav ke pratibal samaan rup se santulit ho jaaen
 The search should be pre-fitted with wooden pallets or sand belts, so that the bulge or vibration does not reach the stopper while degrading, and the whole search can be done once
 40 foot se adhik paat kii daat lagaate samay dhule ke madhya bhaag par vahaan laganevaali sab iten lad deni chahie, phir daat lagaana aarambh karnaa chahie
 In principle, if the shape of the stopper is suitable, so that the linear stopper remains in the midpoint, then the pressure will remain in the stopper and the stopper will remain even if there is no spice in the masonry joints
 uthaan or paat kaa anupaat, jahaan tak sambhav ho, adhik rakhana chahie
 When this ratio is less than 1 / 5, the heat and contraction effects increase and due to the load, the damping and thawing also increase
 at: 1 / 10 nunatam seemaa manani chahie
 The best ratio is from 1 / 5 to 1 / 3 with a focus on austerity
 yadi anupaat 1 / 2 or 1 / 4 ke madhya ho daat-challe or pilpayon main saamagree nunatam lagati he, kyonki gol daaton se pilpayon par bilkul thel nahin pahunchati or andakaar daat se bahut kam pahunchati he
 The parabolic or badi stopper, oval or three central stopper, is good and looks good
 dar kaa paat uski kul oonchaai se adhik ho to acha he, nahin to pilpayon, payon or baaju deevaaron main saamagree adhik lagegi
 At the end, there is a stopper from one side and clay from the other side
 at: ye itane majboot hone chahie ki kisi ek ore kii thel ke abhaav main bhi duusari ore kii thel sahan kar saken
 The pies should be strong enough to bear all the thrust generated as a result of full load on only one of the hoists on both sides

 Maharishi Swami Dayanand Saraswati was a great thinker, social reformer and patriot of modern India
 unka bachapan kaa naam 'mulshankar' tha
 He founded an Arya Samaj reformer organization - Arya Samaj in 1874
 ve ek sanyasi tathaa ek mahaan chintak the
 He always considered the power of the Vedas to be paramount
 swamiji ne karm siddhanth, punarjanm, brahmacharya tathaa sanyas ko apane darshan ke chaar stambh banaaya
 He first gave the slogan of 'swarajya' in 1876, which was later promoted by Lokmanya Tilak
 swami dayanand ke vichaaron se prabhavit mahapurushon kii sankhya asankhya he, inamen pramukh naam hai- maadaam bhikaaji kama, pandit lekharam arya, swami shraddhand, pandit gurudutt vidhyaarthee, shyaamaji krishna verma, vinayak damodar saavarkar, lala hardayal, madanlaal dhingra, ram prasad 'bismil', mahadev govind rande, mahatma hansraj, lala lajpat raay ityadi
 Among the prominent followers of Swami Dayanand, Lala Hansraj founded the 'dayanand Anglo Vedic College' at Lahore in 1886 and Swami Shraddhanand established the Gurukul at Kangri near Haridwar in 1901
 dayanand saraswati kaa janm 12 farvari tankaara main san 1824 main morabi ke paas kathiyawad kshetra, gujarat main hua tha
 His father's name was Karshanji Lalji Tiwari and mother's name was Yashodabai
 unke pita ek kar-colector hone ke saath brahman parivaar ke ek amir, samrudh or prabhaavshaalee vyakti the
 Dayanand Saraswati's real name was Moolshankar and his early life was very comfortable
 aage chalakar ek pandit banane ke liye ve sanskrit, veda, shastron va anya dharmik pustakon ke adhyayan main lag gaye
 There were many such incidents in his life which forced him to ask serious questions about the traditional beliefs of Hinduism and God
 ek baar shivaratri kii ghatana he
 Then they were only children
 shivaratri ke us din unka puraa parivaar raatri jaagran ke liye ek mandir main hi rukaa hua tha
 Even after the whole family went to sleep, he kept awake that Lord Shiva would come and receive the Prasad
 unhone dekha ki shivaji ke liye rakhe bhoga ko chuuhe kha rahe hai
 Seeing this, they were very surprised and started thinking that what God will not protect the offerings offered to him will protect humanity? He argued with his father and argued that we should not worship such a helpless God
 apni choti bahan or chachaa kii haije ke kaaran hui mrityu se ve jivan-maran ke arth par gaharaai se sochane lage or aise prashn karne lage jisase unke mata pita chintit rahane lage
 Then his parents decided to marry him at the beginning of adolescence (this was common practice)
 lekin balak mulshankar ne nishchay kiya ki vivaah unke liye nahin bana he or ve 1846 main satya kii khoj main nikal pade
 Maharishi Dayanand has a high sense of idealism in his heart, a natural tendency to take a realistic path, an indomitable zeal to redesign the destiny of the motherland, a keen desire to contemplate religious-socio-economic and political terms and a glorious past among the Aryavarites
 There was a feeling of loyalty
 unhone kisi ke virodh tathaa ninda karne kii parvaah kiye bina aryaavart ke hindu samaaj kaa kayakalp karnaa apana dhyey bana liya tha
 On the day of Shivaratri in Phalgun Krishna Samvat 1895, his life took a new turn
 unhen nayaa bodh hua
 He left the house and while traveling he reached Guru Virjanand
 guruvar ne unhen panini vyakaran, paatanjal-yogasutra tathaa veda-vedang kaa adhyayan karaayaa
 In Guru Dakshina, he sought - show success by learning, doing charity, salvation of the true scriptures, do not eradicate the ignorance of dissenters, remove the darkness of ignorance from the light of Vedas, radiate the light of Vedic religion everywhere
 yahi tumhaari gurudakshina he
 He blessed that God would make his efforts successful
 unhone antim shiksha di -manushyakrut granthon main ishwar or rishiyon kii ninda he, rishikrut granthon main nahin
 Vedas are proof
 is kasuti ko haath se na chhodana
 Maharishi Dayanand traveled to many places
 unhone haridwar main kumbh ke avasar par 'pakhand khandini pataakaa' fahraai
 He did many lectures
 ve kalakatta main babu keshavachandra sen tathaa devendra nath thakur ke sampark main aae
 It is from here that he started wearing full clothes and speaking and writing in Hindi
 yaheen unhone tatkaaleen visarai ko kaha tha, main chahta hum videshiyon kaa rajya bhi purna sukhadaayak nahin he
 But it is very difficult to get rid of different language, different education, different behavior
 bina iske chute paraspar kaa vyavhaar puraa upkaar or abhipraay siddh hona kathin he
 Maharishi Dayanand established the Aryasamaj at Chaitra Shukla Pratipada Samvat in 1932 in Girgaum Mumbai
 aryasamaj ke niyam or siddhant pranimaatr ke kalyaan ke liye he
 To benefit the world is the main objective of this society, that is, physical, spiritual and social progress
 main maanata hoon ki gita main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Also the Gita is not against the Vedas
 vedon ko chhod kar koi anya dharmagranth pramaan nahin he - is satya kaa prachaar karne ke liye swami ji ne saare desh kaa daura karnaa prarambh kiya or jahaan-jahaan ve gayi pracheen parampara ke pandit or vidwaan unase haar maanate gayi
 He had extensive knowledge of Sanskrit language
 sanskrit main ve dharapravaah bolte the
 At the same time, they were very logical
 unhone isai or muslim dharmagranthon kaa bhalee-bhaanti adhyayan-manthan kiya tha
 So alone they started a struggle on three fronts
 do morche to isiyat or islam ke the kintu teesraa morcha sanatandharmee hinduon kaa tha, jinase jujhane main swami ji ko anek apmaan, kalank or ksht jhelane pade
 There was no response to the torch lit by Dayanand
 ve jo kuch kah rahe the, uskaa uttar na to musalmaan de sakate the, na isai, na puraanon par palane vaale hindu pandit or vidwaan
 Hindu Navothan had now come into full light and many sensible people started to feel in their mind that in fact there is no essence in the Pongapanthi of mythological religion
 swamiji prachlit dharmon main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa kadaa khandan karte the chaahe vah sanathan dharm ho yaa islam ho yaa isai dharm ho
 In his Mahagranth Satyarth Prakash, Swamiji has denied the evils prevailing in all opinions
 unke samakaleen sudhaarkon se alag, swamiji kaa mat shikshit varg tak hi simit nahin tha apitu arya samaaj ne aryaavart ke saadhaaran janamanas ko bhi apni ore aakarshith kiya
 In 1872, Swamiji came to Calcutta
 vahaan devendranath thakur or keshavachandra sen ne unka bada satkar kiya
 He also had discussions with Brahmo Samajis, but Brahmo Samaj scholars influenced by Christianity could not agree with Swami regarding the rebirth and authenticity of Veda
 kehete hai kalkatte main hi keshavachandra sen ne swami ji ko yah salaah de daali ki yadi aap sanskrit chhod kar aryabhasha main bolnaa armbh karen, to desh kaa aseem upkaar ho saktaa he
 Since then, the language of Swami Ji's lectures became Aryabhasha and he started to have a lot of followers in the Aryan speaking provinces
 kalkatte se swami ji mumbai padhaare or vahiin 10 april 1875 i
 ko unhone 'arya samaaj' kii sthapana kii
 Prayer community also discussed with him in Mumbai
 kintu yah samaaj to brahmo samaaj kaa hi mumbai sanskaran tha
 Therefore, even the people of this society could not agree with Swami ji
 mumbai se laut kar swami ji indraprastha aae
 There he called a meeting of Christian, Muslim and Hindu priests for Satyansandha
 kintu do dinon ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bhi log kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake
 Swamiji went to Punjab from Indraprastha
 punjab main unke prati bahut utsaah jaagrath hua or saare praant main aryasamaj kii shakhaaen khulne lageen
 Since then, Punjab has been the principal stronghold of the Arya Samajis
 maharishi dayanand ne tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt saamaajik kuritiyon tathaa andhvishwaason or rudhiyon-buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye, nirbhay hokar un par akraman kiya
 They were called 'saints warriors'
 unhone janmana jati kaa virodh kiya tathaa karm ke aadhaar vedanukool varna-nirdhaaran kii baat kahi
 He was a supporter of Dalits
 unhone striyon kii shiksha ke liye prabal aandolan chalaaya
 He prohibited child marriage and sati and supported widow marriage
 unhone ishwar ko sristi kaa nimitt kaaran tathaa prakruti ko anadi tathaa shaashvat mana
 He was an advocate of oilism
 unke darshanik vichaar vedanukool the
 He also believed that the living beings are free to work and are free to enjoy the fruits
 maharishi dayanand sabhi dharmanuayiyon ko ek manch par laakar ekta sthapit karne ke liye prayatnsheel the
 He made such an effort in 1878 during the Indraprastha court
 unke amar granth satyarth prakaash, sanskaar vidhi or rigvedadi bhashya bhoomika main unke moulik vichaar suspasht rup main prapya hai
 He was a yogi and had special emphasis on pranayama
 ve saamaajik punargathan main sabhi varnon tathaa striyon kii bhagidaari ke pakshdhar the
 In the direction of national awakening, he adopted the path of social revolution and spiritual revival
 unki shiksha sambandhi dharanaon main pradarshit doordarshita, deshbhakti tathaa vyavhaarikta purnataya praasangik tathaa uganukool he
 Maharishi Dayanand was not only a social reformer and a pioneer of religious renaissance, he was also a great nationalist and political idealist
 videshiyon ke aryaavart main rajya hone ke kaaran aapas kii foot, matbhed, brahmacharya kaa seven na karnaa, vidhaan padhnaa-padhaana va baalyavastha main aswayamvaravivaah, vishayasakti, mithyaa bhashaavadi, kulakshan, veda-vidya kaa prachaar aadi kukarm hai, jab aapas main bhai-bhai ladte hai or tabhi teesraa videshi aakar panch ban baithta he
 He has also enumerated the qualifications required for the head of state and various councils and committees of government
 unhone nyaay kii vyavastha rishi pranit granthon ke aadhaar par kiye jane kaa paksh liya
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati is generally known only as the founder and social reformer of the Arya Samaj
 rashtriya swatantrata ke liye kiye gaye prayatnon main unki ullekhneey bhoomika kii jaankaree bahut kam logon ko he
 The fact is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had probably first dared to say that "aryavarta belongs to Aryavartis" in the subordinated Aryavarta
 hamaare pratham swatantrata samar, san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn yojana bhi swami ji ke netritv main hi taiyaar kii gai thi or vahi uske pramukh sutaradhar bhi the
 He often preached nationalism to the audience in his sermons and filled the spirit of dying for the country
 1855 main haridwar main jab kumbh mela laga tha to usamen shaamil hone ke liye swami ji ne abu parvat se haridwar tak paidal yatra kii thi
 On the way, he preached from place to place and explored the pulse of the countrymen
 unhone yah anubhav kiya ki log ab angrejon ke atyaachaari shashan se tang aa chuke hai or desh kii swatantrata ke liye sangharsh karne ko aatur ho uthe hai
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati reached Haridwar and camped in a solitary place on a hill there
 vahiin par unhone paanch aise vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii, jo aage chalakar san 1857 kii kranti ke karnadhaar bane
 These five persons were Nana Saheb, Azimullah Khan, Bala Saheb, Tatya Tope and Babu Kunwar Singh
 baatcheet kaaphi lambi chali or yaheen par yah tay kiya gaya ki firangi sarkaar ke viruddh sampoorn desh main sashastr kranti ke liye aadharbhumi taiyaar kii jaae or uske baad ek nishchit din sampoorn desh main ek saath kranti kaa bigul baja diya jaae
 a plan of 'roti Aur Kamal' was also prepared to spread the voice of this revolution among the general public and Aryavartiya soldiers
 is sampoorn vichaar vimarsh main pramukh bhoomika swami dayanand saraswati kii hi thi
 After discussion and planning, Swamiji stopped in Haridwar and the other five national leaders went to their respective places to give realization to the plan
 unke jane ke baad swami ji ne apane kuch vishwast sadhu sanyasiyon se sampark sthapit kiya or unka ek gupt sanghathan banaaya
 The headquarters of this organization was built at the Yogmaya temple at Mehrauli in Indraprastha
 is mukhyalay ne swadhinata samar main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai
 Under the leadership of Swamiji, sadhus also awakened the revolution throughout the country
 ve krantikariyon ke sandesh ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaate, unhen protsaahit karte or aavashyaktaa padane par swayan bhi hathiyaar uthaakar angrejon se sangharsh karte
 During the entire period of the revolution of 1857, the national leader, Swami Dayanand Saraswati remained in constant contact
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa par bhi swami ji niraash nahin the
 He was already aware of the fact that freedom cannot be attained only by trying once
 iske liye to sangharsh kii lambi prakriya chalaani hogi
 At the 1855 meeting in Haridwar itself, when Babu Kunwar Singh asked Swamiji about the possibility of success in this struggle, his answer was "the freedom struggle never fails
" bharat dhire-dhire ek sau varsh main paratantra bana he
 Now it will take one hundred years to become independent as well
 is swatantrata prapti main bahut se anmol praanon kii aahutiyaan daali jaaengi
 "how accurate Swami Ji's prediction turned out to be, was confirmed by subsequent events
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa ke baad jab tathya tope, naanaa sahab tathaa anya rashtriya netaa swami ji se mili to unhen bhi unhone niraash na hone tathaa uchit samay kii pratiksha karne kii hi salaah di
 Two years after the revolution of 1857, Swamiji made Swami Virjanand his guru and took initiation from him
 swami virajanand ke ashram main rahakar unhone vedon kaa adhyayan kiya, un par chintan kiya or uske baad apane guru ke nirdeshaanusaar ve vaidic gyaan ke prachaar-prasar main jute gaye
 To achieve this objective, he also founded the Arya Samaj and through it did many works of social improvement
 chuaachhut, sati pratha, bal vivaah, nar bali, dharmik sankeernata tathaa andhvishwaason ke viruddh unhone jamkar prachaar kiya or vidhwaa vivaah, dharmik udaartaa tathaa aapasi bhaichaare kaa unhone samarthan kiya
 Along with all this, Swamiji never failed to fill the spirit of patriotism among the people
 prarambh main anek vyaktiyon ne swami ji ke samaaj sudhaar ke kaaryon main vibhinn prakaar ke vighn daale or unka virodh kiya
 Gradually, his arguments started coming to the understanding of the people and the opposition decreased
 unki lokapriyata nirantar badhane lagi
 This led to a desire in the minds of British officials that if they were made in favor of the British Government, then through them, the British could be popularized in the general public
 isse purv angrej adhikari isi prakaar se anya kuch dharmopadeshkon tathaa dharmadhikariyon ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan dekar apni taraf mila chuke the
 He also considered Swami Dayanand Saraswati like him
 tadnusaar ek isai padri ke madhyam se swami ji kii tatkaaleen governor general lord northbrook se mulaakaat karavaayi gai
 The meeting took place in Calcutta in March 1873
 idhar-udhar kii kuch aupchaarik baton ke uparant lord northbrook ne vinamrata se apni baat swami ji ke saamne rakhi- "apane vyaakhyaan ke prarambh main aap jo ishwar kii prarthana karte hai, kya usamen aap angreji sarkaar ke kalyaan kii bhi prarthana kar sakenge
 " garvanar general kii baat sunakar swami ji sahaj hi sab kuch samaj gaye
 He also felt pity for the intelligence of the British government, which could not understand him properly
 unhone nirbhikta or dridhtaa se governor general ko uttar diya- The Governor General did not expect such a sharp reply from Swamiji
 mulaakaat tatkaal samaapt kar di gai or swami ji vahaan se laut aae
 After this, the intelligence department of the government had a keen eye on Swami ji and his organization Arya Samaj
 unki prayek gatividhi or unke dwaara bole gaye prayek shabd kaa ricard rakhaa jane laga
 Due to their impact on the general public, the government began to realize that this rebel Fakir and Arya Samaj can become a threat to the government any day
 isliye swami ji ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi tarah-tarah ke shadyantr rache jane lage
 The circumstances under which Swamiji died, give the same impression that there was definitely a conspiracy of the English government in it
 swami ji kii mrityu 30 oktober 1883 ko deepawali ke din sandhyaa ke samay hui thi
 In those days, he had gone to Jodhpur at the invitation of King Naresh Jaswant Singh
 vahaan unke nity hi pravachan hote the
 Sometimes Maharaja Jaswant Singh would also sit at his feet and listen to his sermons there
 do-chaar baar swami ji bhi rajya mehalon main gaye
 There he saw the unnecessary intervention of a prostitute named Nanhi and his immense influence on Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 swami ji ko yah bahut bura laga
 When he explained this to Maharaj, he politely accepted his word and broke the relationship with the little one
 isse nanheen swami ji ke bahut adhik viruddh ho gai
 He got Swami ji's cook Kalia alias Jagannath on his side and got the glass mixed in his milk
 thodi hi der baad swami ji ke paas aakar apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya or uske liye kshamaa maangi
 The benevolent-hearted Swami Ji gave him five hundred rupees for his living and living, so that the police would not disturb him
 baad main jab swami ji ko jodhpur ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya to vahaan sambandhit chikitsak bhi shaq ke daayre main rahaa
 He was accused of giving light poison to Swamiji in the name of medicine
 baad main jab swami ji kii tabiyat bahut kharaab hone lagi to unhen ajmer ke aspataal main laayaa gaya
 But by then there was a lot of delay
 swami ji ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 The apprehension in this entire incident is that the task of raising the prostitute and tricking the doctor was done by a British officer at the behest of the British government
 anyathaa ek saadhaaran veshya ke liye yah sambhav nahin tha ki keval apane balboote par swami dayanand saraswati jaise suprasiddh or lokapriy vyakti ke viruddh aisa shadyantr kar sake
 Without such encouragement and protection, even the doctor could not do this audacity
 swadharm, swabhaasha, swarashtra, swasamskruti or swadeshonnati ke agradoot swami dayanand ji kaa sharir san 1883 main deepawali ke din panchtatv main villin ho gaya or ve apane peeche chhod gaye ek siddhanth, krinvanto vishwamaryam - arthath saare sansar ko shreshth maanav banaao
 His last words were - "lord! You did well
 aapaki ichha purna ho
 " swami dayanand saraswati ne kai dharmik va saamaajik pustaken apni jivan kaal main likhin
 The early books were in Sanskrit, but over time he also wrote many books in Aryabhasa, because Aryabhasa had more reach than Sanskrit
 hindi ko unhone 'aryabhasha' kaa naam diya tha
 Swami Dayanand was the pioneer and early man who used the Aryabhasha for better writing
 swami dayanand saraswati kii mukhya kritiyaan nimnlikhit hai- In 1873, a book called Aryodeshyaratnamala was published in which Swamiji described the definition of one hundred words
 inamen se kai shabd aam bolchaal main aate hai par unke arth rutes ho gaye hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ishwar, dharm, karm, aadi
 They are defined and explained in this book
 is laghu pustika main 8 prishth hai
 In 1881, Swami Dayanand published a book called Gokrunanidhi which also takes credit for playing a major role in establishing the Goraksha movement
 is pustak main unhone sabhi samudaay ke logon ko apane pratinidhi sahit gokrishyaadi raksha samiti kii sadsyta lene ko kaha he jiskaa uddeshy pashu va krishi kii raksha he
 Like modern environmentalists, ideas have been made here
 is pustak main samiksha, niyam va upanium hai, tathaa pramukhtah pashuon ko na maar kar unka paalan karne main hone vaale laabh varnit kiye gaye hai
 The book Behavnabhanu was published in 1880 by the Vedic machinery, Banaras
 isamen dharmokt or uchit vyavhaar ke bare main varnan he
 On 27 February 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati in Udaipur published an acknowledgment in which he handed over the responsibility of philanthropy to 23 persons after his death, who could then carry on their work
 inamen mahadev govind rande kaa bhi naam he
 This acknowledgment is signed as a witness to 13 dignitaries
 iske prakaashan ke kuch chah maah pashchaat hi unka dehant ho gaya tha
 This is a small conversation book teaching Sanskrit
 vibhinn vishyon par laghu vaakya sanskrit main diye gayi hai
 Their meanings are also given in Hindi
