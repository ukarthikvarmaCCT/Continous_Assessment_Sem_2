 kerala kii gramin samskruti ke praturup hai lok kreedaayen
 These folk sports are associated with Kerala's ethics, literature, caste system etc
 lok kreedaaon kaa lakshya vijayi kaa chayan karnaa maatr nahin tha, inamen gaan, nrity, purakatha sandarbhon kaa samaran, sahabhaagita sabhi bhav anternihit the
 Because of this, there are many folk sports in which no one is considered victorious
 rashtriya lakshyon ko siddh karne ke liye bhi lok kreedaa yojit kii jaati thim
 An example of this is the fighting of the roosters
 madhyakaalin kerala main murga bhindt se riyasaton ke adhipatiyon ke bich ke vaad - vivaad kaa samaadhaan dhundha jaataa tha
 If it had not been resolved, then they would have been ready for 'aankam' ie human duel war
 murgon kii ladai aaj kal prachlit nahin he
 But a Bhindat called 'kozhipporu' is organized in which the hens are allowed to fight mutually, but no one has to lose their lives
 yah kreedaa aaj bhi uttari malbar main prachlit he
 Most of the arts of Kerala have started with sports
 atyant pracheen kaliattem kaalaantar main adhik taal nishth kala ke rup main viksit hokar paribhaasha baddh ho gaya
 Many colors took many elements from different sports
 parichamuttukali, kolkkali, tullal, dappukahai, kathakali, purakkali ityadi main kalarippayttu ke prabhaav lakshith hote hai
 Renowned scholar Moorkottu Kumaran states that Kerala sports can be called the confluence of 'kala and Kamala'
 aaj khele jane vaale kai khelon main nrity-sa talbaddh pad vinyas, geet tathaa mithkeey bimb kii jhalak milti he
 Similarly, many fine arts in Kerala are known as 'kali'
 udhaaharan drashtavy hai - kathakali, cacottikkali, tullalakali, purakkali, aravanakkali aadi
 Thus, the sports in which art prevails, they do not come under folk sports
 kerala kii kshetreey kalaon ko paanch vibhaagon main baant sakate hai- kalhakkali, kaushalkkali, bhagyakkali, anveshankkali or anukarankkali
 Kalhakkali is a game that contains a sense of humor and quarreling
 is prakaar ke khelon main thodaa bahut bal prayog dhakka-mukki, kheenchaatani aadi hua karte hai
 Ex: kabaddi, tumbikali etc
 isamen daavpenchon kii pradhanta rahati he
 Achieving goals with simple measures without exhaling is the specialty of this game
 kaushalpurvak moharen chalaanaa, pratidwandvi kii gati samajhakar pratikriya jataana aadi prastut khelon kii visheshtaayen hai
 Ex: Talappantukali, Kakkukali etc
 ye aise khel hai jo bhagyashrith rahete hai
 But it also has some skill but luck is the key
 utsav maidan ke hathi, mayur, oont khelon se lekar jua, pakirkahai aadi isamen shaamil hai
 Their common quality is to hide an object and find it
 in khelon main anumaan tathaa bhagya kaa sthaan adhik he
 Eg - undercover, pantolam etc
 ye ve khel hai jinamein puraana paatro se lekar pashu-pakshiyon tak kaa anukaran kiya jaataa he
 a simulation game like 'tavachchatam' involves reaching the frog first
 kintu 'siyaar or gaay' khel main thodaa-sa bal prayog bhi shaamil he
 With the advent of the European Games, many folk sports in Kerala disappeared
 radio- televizan prasaaran samprekshan tathaa sitaron ke udai aadi se cricket ghar-ghar pahunch gaya
 People of Kerala have no less respect for the sports of international importance like football, volleyball, basketball etc
 than any other country in the world
 kala or jivan main bhoomandaleekaran ke kaaran bady krantiyaan hui hai magar khelon ke vishay main koi kranti nahin hui
 There is no lack of globalization on any public sport
 haan, anek lok kreedaayen vilupti ke kagaar par zarur pahunch gayin
 Folk sports disappeared in exchange of change
 aaj kerala kii locakreedaaon par anusandhan karne tathaa bahut-si lok-kreedaaon kii punarsthapana kaa prayaas jari he
 The efforts of people like Dr
 MV Vishnu Namputiri in this direction are praiseworthy
 'foculor nighantu', 'naatan kaliklum vinodanglum' aadi granth lok kreedaaon par prakaash daalate hai

 vrahat kaksh: gupha san01 Entry Gate nandavansh pracheen bharat kaa sarvaadhik shaktishaalee evam mahaan nyaayi athwa nai rajvansh tha
 Who ruled the vast part of northern India in the fifth-fourth century BC
 nandavansh kii sthapana pratham chakravarti samraat mahapadmanand ne kii thi
 For the first time in Indian history, an empire was established whose boundaries extended across the Gangetic plains
 yah samrajya vastutah swatantra rajyon yaa saamanton kaa shithil sangh naa hokar balki kisi shaktishaalee raja bal ke sammukh natmastak hote the
 It was an unbroken monarchy under the umbrella of Ekrat, which had immense military power, money power and manpower
 chakravarti samraat mahapadmanand ne nikatavarti sabhi rajwansho ko jitkar ek vishaal samrajya kii sthapana kii evam kendriya shashan kii vyavastha lagu kii
 That is why Samrat Mahapadam Nanda is called the father of central governance

 "mahanand" main kiya gaya tha isaki pushti samraat samudragupta dwaara rachit mahakavy "krishna charitra" ke praarambhik teen shloko se hoti he
 But the details of the said epic remain only

 Many details of history information are found in the Puranas, Jain and Buddhist texts and the description of Greek historians
 tathaapi itnaa nishchit rup se kaha ja saktaa he ki nand ek rajvansh tha jisaki adhikansh prakrutiyaan bhartiya shashan parampara kii thi
 Curtius states that Shakara's father was actually the son of a poor barber at the time of Alexander, from the accounts of Greek writers it is known that he was the "present king" Agramas or Jandramas, who are identified with Dhanananda
 uskaa pita mahapadmanand tha, jo curtius ke upyukt kathan se kshatriya varna kaa thahartaa he
 In some Purana texts and Jain texts "appendix Parva", he is also called the son of Naipit
 in anek sandarbhon se keval ek baat spasht hoti he ki nandavansh ke raja nyaay kshatriya varna ke the
 He was the first and best-known king of Nandavansh
 puranagranth uski ginati shaishunagvansha main hi karte hai, kintu buddha or jain anutrutiyon main use ek nae vansh kaa prarambhkarta mana gaya he, jo sahi he
 He is also called Ugrasena in Jain texts and Mahapadmapati in Puranas
 puraanon ke kaliyugarajavrittantavle anshon main use atibali, mahakshatrantic or or parashuram kii sangyaayen di gai hai
 It is clear that the king with very large army, after destroying many contemporary Kshatriya dynasties, demonstrated his force
 yah aashcharya nahin ki us apaar dhan or sainyashakti se usne himalay or narmada ke bich ke saare pradeshon ko jeetne kaa upkram kiya
 His conquered territories included Akshvaku, Panchal, Kauravya, Kashi, Haihay, Ashmak, Vitihotra, Kalinga, Shursen, Mithila, and many other states
 himalay or vindhyachal ke bich kahin bhi uske shasno kaa ulanghan nahin ho saktaa tha
 Thus he ruled the whole earth as "erat

 Much information about the queens of Mahapadmananda is not available
 puraanon main mahapadmanand ke das putr uttaradhikari bataae gaye hai
 See their names there gangan paal, panduk, pandugati, bhootpal, rashtrapal, govishanak, dashasiddhak, kaivart or dhananand, chand nand Chandragupta Maurya was the son of the monarch Chakravarti Emperor Mahapadmananda of the Nanda dynasty, whose real name was Chandranand, whose mother was from a Brahmin family, Mahapadmananda was followed by his son Dhanananda, who feared Sikandar
 dhananand ne mantri chanakya ko petakar sabha se isaliye baahar nikaala diya chanakya dhananand se pehle singhaasana par baith gayi the 
 Chanakya provoked Dhananand's half-brother Chandranand to kill Dhananand by deceiving Chandranand and made Chandranand Crow king and named Chandranand Crow as Chandragupta Maurya

 He made two attacks on Magadha, it seems correct, but the "divyavadaan" obedience that he first attacked Magadha's capital Pataliputra and failed and he and Chanakya had to flee to save their lives, Does not seem right

 Nature inspired construction has its own principles
 kisi bhi nirmaan ko tabhi vaastavik rup main prakruti dwaara abhiprerit kaha ja saktaa he jab vah kuch paristhitiyon main khara utarataa he
 The following principles of such an ideal construction are
 anuprayogtmak rup main prakruti abhiprerit nirmaan kii teen vidhiyaan prayog main laai jaati hai
 If we look around us, we will find many examples where a construction has been done using these methods

 Accordingly, it is our responsibility to make use of the resources available on the earth in such a way that it is available for the future as well as for the future and in every situation is compatible with environmental protection
 aise main ham dekhte hai ki jaev abhiprerit nirmaan isamen bahut had tak sahaayak siddh ho sakate hai
 It is universally accepted that there is already a solution to many problems in nature which we are still trying to solve
 aavashyaktaa bas isi baat kii he ki apni drushti ko vyapak banaaya jaae
 If we are to make the best use of this natural intelligence, then we must first abandon our ideology in which we consider it as a source of resources and remain insane to some extent for its use

 Pad Abort Test 1 was the first aborted test of the Apollo spacecraft on November 17, 1963
 pad abort test 1 pad se palaayan ke dauraan apollo antariksh yaan par prabhaav kii jaanch karne kaa ek mishan tha
 The launch escape system was to be able to take the spacecraft away from the rocket on the launch pad in the event of an emergency
 launch palaayan system ne yojana anusaar antariksh yaan ko bahut kam samay main hi adhik uchai par le jaakar parachute khol diya
 The spacecraft was successfully launched onto the water
 tathaa yah abhiyaan safal rahaa tha
 Actually, the launch migration system has very short-lived rockets and the rockets are turned upside down which causes them to burn faster
 isliye launch palaayan system apatkaal main bahut kam samay main antariksh yaan ko launch pad par rocket se dur le jaataa he
 The production model launch in flight is the first mission to introduce the escape system and boilerplate Apollo spacecraft

 The launch escape system was disengaged after 15 seconds, allowing the spacecraft to move along the ballistic trajectory
 parachute pranali ne puri tarah se kaam kiya: drug shuti ne antariksh yaan ko sthir kar diya, phir teen mukhya parachutes ne antariksh yaan ke girane kii gati 26 kilometre prati ghante kar diya
 The only problems encountered with the flight were that soot was dropped by rocket launch systems on the outskirts of the spacecraft and the stability of the spacecraft was less than anticipated

 jo yantra mitti ko keval idhar-udhar chalaa den parantu palaten nahin, unhen kaltiwaitor, hero, aadi kehete hai
 From this point of view, native plow can be called cultivator, but not plow

 bakkhar kaa upyog bundelkhand, madhya pradesh aadi main adhik hota he, kyonki vahaan kii bhoomi matiyaar hone tathaa varshakaal main geeli rahane ke kaaran joti nahin ja sakati
 Hence weeds also become more
 is bhoomi ko yadi uchit ardrata hone par hi na jota ja sake to yah kadi ho jaati he
 Due to the greater area to be collected from the bakhar, this work can be done in a short period of time and the land can be saved from hardening

 hindi kii vartanee ke vividh pahaluon ko lekar 19veen shatabdi ke antim charan se hi vividh prayaas hote rahe hai
 In this context, the All India Seminar was organized by the Central Hindi Directorate in the year 2003 for standardization of Devanagari script and Hindi spelling
 is sangoshtee main maanak hindi vartanee ke liye nimnlikhit niyam nirdhaarit kiye gaye the jinhen san 2012 main aies / IS 16500 : 2012 ke rup main lagu kiya gaya he
 At present the scope of standard Hindi spelling is that of the Central Hindi Directorate
 hindi vartanee ke maanakeekaran kii disha main kai diggajon ne apana yogadan diya, jinamein se acharya kishoridas vaajapeyi tathaa acharya ramchandra verma ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Due to the substantial increase in the number of Hindi learners within and outside the country as a result of the acceptance of the official language of the Union of Hindi language and some states, it seemed necessary and time-bound to set the standard system of Hindi spelling, so that more uniformity in the spelling of Hindi words Can be brought tadnusaar, shiksha mantralay, bharat sarkaar ne 1961 main hindi vartanee kii maanak paddati nirdhaarit karne ke liye ek visheshgy samiti niyukt kii
 This committee gave the final report in April 1962
 samiti kii chaar baithken huin jinamein gambhir vichaar-vimarsh ke baad vartanee ke sambandh main ek niyamavali nirdhaarit kii gai
 The committee accordingly submitted its final recommendations in 1962 which were approved by the government and eventually ushered in the official process of standardization of Hindi language
 kendriya hindi nideshaalay ne prathmat: 1968 main “hindi vartanee kaa maanakeekaran” naam se laghu pustika prakashit kii
 In the year 1983, a free revised and enhanced version of this booklet "standardization of Devanagari script and Hindi spelling" was published
 is pustika kii lagaataar badhati maang ko dekhte hue varsh 1989 main iskaa punarmudran karaayaa gaya tathaa vibhinn hindi sevi sansthaaon, karyaalayon, shikshan sansthaanon main ni:shulk vitaran karaayaa gaya taaki adhik-se-adhik sansthaaon main hindi ke maanak rup kaa prayog bade

, newspapers, magazines etc
 officially adopted this standardization to bring uniformity in the language
 varsh 1968 ke maanakeekaran kaa mukhya aadhaar prayokta or tankan yantra rahaa tha
 In today's era of information, the need was felt to revise and change the standardization of Hindi language and to create computerized Unicode for Devanagari script
 isi taratamya main kendriya hindi nideshaalay dwaara varsh 2003 main devanagari lipi tathaa hindi vartanee ke maanakeekaran ke liye akhil bhartiya sangoshtee kaa aayojan kiya tha
 The rules that were laid down for standard Hindi spelling in this seminar are given below

 yatha:– prakaar, dharm, raashtra
 2
1

4 will be the prevailing form of education only
 ise 


 ke rup main nahin likhaa jayega
 The use of either one of the first tr and 


 forms for the combined form of t + r was allowed
 parantu ab iskaa paramparaagat rup tra hi maanak mana jaae
 Other consonants other than sra and tr will be formed as per rules of + R's conjunct 2

 jaise :– kr, pra, br, sr, hr aadi
 2
1

5 The quantity of e will be used immediately before the corresponding consonant, and not before the entire consonant with the second consonant of the conjunct formed from the letter marked with light
 yatha:– kuttim, chitthiyaan, dwitiya, budhimaan, chihnit aadi 
 Note: While quoting the original Sanskrit verses, conjuncts can also be written in the old style
 jaise:– sanyukt, chihn, vidya, vidwaan, vruddh, dwitiya, buddhi aadi
 But if these too are written according to the above rules, then there will be no objection
 2
2
1 hindi ke kaarak chihn sabhi prakaar ke sangya shabdon main pratipadik se pruthak likhe jaaen
 Like: - Ram, Ram, Ram, woman, woman, service etc
 sarvnaam shabdon main ye chihn pratipadik ke saath milakar likhe jaaen

1 Hyphens should be placed between positions in the compound
 jaise :– ram-lakshmana, shiv-parvati samvaad, dekh-rekh, chaal-chalan, hansee-mazaaq, len-dein, padhanaa-likhnaa, khaanaa-pinaa, khelnaa-kudana aadi
 2
4
2 should be placed before hyphen
 jaise :– tum-sa, ram-jaisaa, chaaku-se tikhe
 2
4
3 Hypnosis should be used only in a compound where there is a possibility of confusion without it, otherwise not
 jaise :– bhu-tatv
 Generally, there is no need to apply hyphens in the masculine compound
 jaise :– raamarajy, rajkumaar, gangaajal, gramvasi, aatmahatya aadi
 2
4
3
1 Similarly, if the hyphen is not put in all the words 'a-nikh', reading it as 'ankh' can also mean 'anger'
 a-nati : anati, a-paras : apras, bhu-tatv : bhootatv aadi samast padon kii bhi yahi sthiti he
 All these pairs are different words from both spelling and meanings
 2

4 kathin sandhiyon se bachane ke liye bhi hifan kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Such as - Dv-syllable, Dv-meaning etc

 Factors are also identified in front of some latencies
 jaise :– ab se, tab se, yahan se, vahaan se, sadaa se aadi
 According to the rule, invariably should always be written separately
 jaise :– aap hi ke liye, mujh tak ko, aapke saath, gaz bhar kapadaa, desh bhar, raat bhar, din bhar, vah itnaa bhar kar de, mujhe jane to do, kaam bhi nahin bana, pachaas rupye maatr aadi
 2

3 Honorable 'shri' and 'G' Akshay should also be written separately
 jaise shri shriram, kanhaiyalaal ji, mahatma ji aadi 
 2
5
4 All the posts should be written by adding the copy, only, etc
 jaise - pratidin, pratishat, maanavmaatr, nimittamaatr, yathasamay, yathochit aadi
 It is a well-known rule that all posts are considered one if there is no harm
 at use vyast rup main na likhakar ek saath likhnaa hi sangat he
 The phrase 'ten rupees only', 'mere two persons' is composed
 yahan maatr alag se likhaa jaae

0 Anusvara is consonant and nasal disorder of resonance
 hindi main ye donon arthbhedak bhi hai
 Hence, both Anusvara and resonance mark will be prevalent in Hindi
 2
6
1 anuswaar 2

1
1 Reminders of Sanskrit words will remain the same before other class characters
 jaise - sanyog, sangrakshan, sanlagn, samvaad, kansa, hinsr aadi
 2
6
1
2 As a combined consonant, if any of the remaining four letters after the fifth letter is used, the reminder should be used for uniformity and convenience of printing / writing
 jaise - pankaj, ganga, chanchal, kanjus, kanth, thanda, sant, sandhya, mandir, sampadak, sambandh aadi 
 The forms kept in bandhani will be valid only in Sanskrit citations
 hindi main bindi kaa prayog karnaa hi uchit hoga
 2
6
1
3 If any letter of any other class comes after the Panchamakshar, then the Panchamakhar will not be changed as a reminder
 jaise :– vaanmay, anya, chinmay, unmukh aadi 
 2
6
1
4 If the fifth Varna comes in divine form, the fifth Varna will not be converted into Anusvara
 jaise - ann, sammelan, sammati aadi 
 2
6
1
5 It would be good to write the nasal consonant in full to remove the confusion of half-letter or anusvara in words accepted from English, Urdu
 jaise :– limka, tankhaah, tinkaa, tamgaa, kamasin aadi
 2
6
1
6 The use of anusvara at the end of some corresponding Sanskrit words is indicative of M
 jaise - ahan, evam, paran, shivan 
 2
6
2 Resonance 2
6
2
1 hindi ke shabdon main uchit dhang se chandrabindu kaa prayog anivaary hoga
 2
6
2
2 Resonance is not consonant, vowels have a sound quality
 anunasik swaron ke uccharan main naak se bhi hawa nikalati he
 Like: - Come, come, go, mother, am, come
 2
6
2
3 chandrabindu ke bina praaia: arth main bhram kii gunjaaish rahati he
 Such as: - Hans: Laughing, Angana: Angana, Swang: Swang etc
 atev aise bhram ko dur karne ke liye chandrabindu kaa prayog avashya kiya janaa chahie
 But where there is a lot of difficulty in printing etc
 with the use of the lunar point and the use of the point in place of the lunar point does not cause any confusion, there will be a relaxation of the use of the point in place of the lunar point
 jaise :– nahin, main, main aadi
 In the context of poetry etc
, Chandrabindu must be used in the context of verses
 isi prakaar chote bacchon kii praveshikaon main jahaan chandrabindu kaa uccharan abhisht ho, vahaan mote aksharon main uskaa yathasthaan sarvatra prayog kiya jaae
 Such as - Where, laughing, courtyard, grooming, me, I, not etc
 2

1 sanskrit ke jin shabdon main visarg kaa prayog hota he, ve yadi tatsam rup main prayukt hon to visarg kaa prayog avashya kiya jaae
 Such as: - In 'sadness'
 yadi us shabd ke tadbhav rup main visarg kaa lop ho chukaa ho to us rup main visarg ke bina bhi kaam chal jayega
 Such as: - 'partner of sorrow and happiness'
 2
7
2 tatsam shabdon ke ant main prayukt visarg kaa prayog anivaary he
 As such: - So, again, automatically, often, completely, basically, finally, literally, respectively, etc
 2

1 Dispersed form should not be written in words such as slack, insular, inferior etc
 2
7
4
2 antahkaran, antahpur, praatavkaal aadi shabd visarg ke saath hi likhe jaaen
 2
7
5 Dispersion should not be used in the words tadbhav / indigenous
 is aadhaar par chah likhnaa galat hoga
 It would be fine to write six
 2
7
6 prayadweep, samaptpraaya aadi shabdon main tatsam rup main bhi visarg nahin he
 2
7
7 Visarga should be written with a letter, while the colon is at some distance from the marked word
 jaise :– atah, yon he :– 2
8
1 should be called light mark and not halant
 vyanjan ke neeche laga hal chihn us vyanjan ke swar rahit hone kii soochna detaa he, yani vah vyanjan vishuddh rup se vyanjan he
 In this way, the word 'jagat' will be called Halant because this word is euphemistic, not a voice
 2
8
2 sanyuktakshar banane ke niyam 2
1
2
2 ke anusaar d chh t th d dh d h main hal chihn kaa hi prayog hoga
 Such as: Chihan, Budha, Vidwan etc
 2
8
3 tatsam shabdon kaa prayog vaanchhneeya ho tab halant roopon kaa hi prayog kiya jaae; vishesh rup se tab jab unase samast pad yaa vyutpann shabd banate hon
 Such as: -, speech-, satt-, bhagavan-, sakshat-, jagat-, tejas-, vyudit- etc
 tatsam sambodhan main he rajan, he bhagwan rup hi sweekrut honge
 In the Hindi style, o King, o God, be written
 jin shabdon main hal chihn lupt ho chukaa ho, unamem use phir se lagane kaa praytn na kiya jaae
 Such as - great, scholar etc; Because in Hindi, forms like 'mahanati' and 'vidwanas' have become popular
 2
8
4 vyakaran granthon main vyanjan sandhi samajhaate hue keval utane hi shabd die jaaen, jo shabd rachana ko samajhane ke liye aavashyak hon yaa arth kii drushti se upyogi hon 
 2
8
5 There does not seem to be any need to explain the disjunction of words like Hridayangam, Uddhan, Sanchit etc
 in Hindi
 isi tarah 'saakshaatkaar', 'jagadish', 'shatkosh' jaise shabdon ke arth ko samajhane kii aavashyaktaa ho tabhi unki sandhi kaa hawala diya jaae
 In Hindi it would be good to accept them as independent words
 2
9
1 sanskritmulak tatsam shabdon kii vartanee ko jyon-kaa-tyon grahan kiya jaae
 Therefore, it would not be appropriate to change 'brahma' to 'brahma', 'sign' to 'symbol', 'urun' to 'urin'
 isi prakaar grahit, drushtavy, pradarshini, atyaadhik, anadhikaar aadi ashuddh prayog grahya nahin hai
 Instead, only the home, writing, exhibition, excessive, unauthorized should be written in their place
 2
9
2 jin tatsam shabdon main teen vyanjanon ke sanyog kii sthiti main ek dwitvamoolak vyanjan lupt ho gaya he use na likhane kii chhot he
 Such as - Ardh> Ardha, Tattva> Element etc
 2
10
1 hindi main i, ou kaa prayog do prakaar ke uccharan ko vyakt karne ke liye hota he
 The first type is pronounced like the original vowels in 'hai', 'and' etc
; While the second type of pronunciation is still safe in words such as 'gawaiya', 'crow', etc
 donon hi prakaar ke uccharanon ko vyakt karne ke liye inhen chihnon kaa prayog kiya jaae
 Modifications such as 'gavayya', 'qava' etc
 are not required
 anya udhaaharan hai :– bhaiya, saiyad, taiyaar, hauva aadi
 2
10
2 The personal names of Iyer, Nayyar, Ramayya etc
 of the south should not be written as Aayar, Nayyar, Ramaiya etc
 according to the Hindi pronunciation, because its pronunciation is different in the native language
 2
10
3 awwal, kavvaal, qawwali jaise shabd prachlit hai
 They should be kept intact in writing
 2
10
4 sanskrit ke tatsam shabd 'shayya' ko 'shaiya' na likhaa jaae
 2
11
1 The past participle suffix should be written by mixing the verb 'kara'
 jaise :– milakar, kha-pikar, ro-rokar aadi
 2
11
2 'tax' will be formed from tax + tax and 'karake' from tax + tax
 2
12
1 kriya roopon main 'karne vaala', 'aane vaala', 'bolne vaala' aadi ko alag likhaa jaae
 Such as: - i am going to go home, people to go
 2
12
2 yojak pratyay ke rup main 'gharavaala', 'topivala', dilavaala, doodhwaala aadi ek shabd ke samaan hi likhe jaayenge
 2
12
3 When 'wala' comes as a suffix, it will be written in accordance with 2
12
2; Otherwise separately
 yah vaala, yah vaali, pehle vaala, acha vaala, laal vaala, kal vaali baat aadi main vaala nirdeshak shabd he
 Therefore, it should be written separately
 isi tarah lambey baalo vaali ladki, dadhi vaala aadmi aadi shabdon main bhi vaala alag likhaa jayega
 From this we can differentiate at the level of composition
 jaise :–gaanwvaala - villager gaanv vaala makaan - village house 2
13
1 Where acclaimed Y, and v are used optionally, the first forms should be used, ie, done, new, new, happened, etc
 yah niyam kriya, visheshan, avyay aadi sabhi roopon or sthitiyon main lagu mana jaae
 Such as: - Shown, for Ram, with book, New Delhi etc
 2
13
2 jahaan 'ya' shrutimulak vyakaranik parivartan na hokar shabd kaa hi mul tatv ho vahaan vaikalpik shrutimulak swaratmak parivartan karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Such as: - Permanent, impersonal, obligation etc
 urdu se aae arabi-farsi mulak ve shabd jo hindi ke ang ban chuke hai or jinaki videshi dhvaniyon kaa hindi dhvaniyon main roopaantar ho chukaa he, hindi rup main hi sweekaar kiye ja sakate hai
 Such as: - pen, fort, stain etc
 par jahaan unka shuddh videshi rup main prayog abhisht ho athwa uccharangat bhed bataanaa aavashyak ho, vahaan unke hindi main prachlit roopon main yathasthaan nukte lagaae jaaen
 Such as: - Food: Food, Raj: Raaz, Fun: Fun etc
 angrezi ke jin shabdon main ardhvivruth 'o' dhwani kaa prayog hota he, unke shuddh rup kaa hindi main prayog abhisht hone par 'aa' kii maatra ke upar ardhachandra kaa prayog kiya jaae 
 As regards the adoption of new words and their Devanāgarī transliteration from English and other foreign languages, Devanāgarī transliteration of international vocabulary was done in august-september, 1962 by the Commission on Scientific and Technical Terminology in the Symposium of Linguists on Scientific Vocabulary
 Recommendation is notable
 usamen yah kaha gaya he ki angrezi shabdon kaa devanagari lipyantaran itnaa clisht nahin hona chahie ki uske vartmaan devanagari varnon main anek nae sanket-chihn lagane paden
 Devanāgarī transliteration of English words should be as close as possible to the standard English pronunciation
 hindi main kuch prachlit shabd aise hai jinaki vartanee ke do-do rup baraabar chal rahe hai
 There is a similar recognition of both forms in Vidvatsamaj
 kuch udhaaharan hai :– gardan / gardan, garmi / garmi, baraf / barf, bilkul / bilkul, sardi / sardi, kursii / kursi, bharti / bhartee, fursat / fursat, bardaasht / bardaasht, waapas / vaapis, aakhirkaar / akhirkaar, baratan / bartan, dubaara / dobaaraa, dukaan / duukaan, beemaari / bimaari aadi
 The first of these alternative forms should be preferred

 vartmaan kaal vyakaranik paribhaasha ke anusaar, kriya ke jis rup se vartmaan samay main maujuud koi sthiti yaa kisi ghatana ke hone kaa sanket miltaa he use 'vartmaan kaal' kehete hai

 isiilie saamaajik manovigyaan ko paribhaashit karnaa saamaanya kaary nahi he
 Robert A
 Baron and John Byrne have rightly written, 'this difficulty in social psychology increases due to two reasons: the broadness of the subject area and the rapid changes in it
 ’ saamaajik manovigyaan ko paribhaashit karte hue unhone likhaa he ki, ‘‘saamaajik manovigyaan vah vigyaan he jo saamaajik paristhitiyon main vyakti ke vyavhaar or vichaar ke swaroop va kaarnon kaa adhyayan karata he
 "something similar is believed by Kimball Young too
" unhonen saamaajik manovigyaan ko paribhaashit karte hue likhaa he ki, ‘‘saamaajik manovigyaan vyaktiyon kii parsparik antakriyaaon kaa adhyayan karata he, or is sandarbh main ki in antalakriyaaon kaa vyakti vishesh ke vichaaron, bhaawanaaon sanvego or aadaton par kya prabhaav padataa he
 '' sheriff or sheriff ke anusaar, ‘‘saamaajik manovigyaan saamaajik uttejnaa-paristhiti ke sandarbh main vyakti ke anubhav tathaa vyavhaar kaa vaigyanik adhyayan he

 '' wiliam mcdugal, oto clinbergh kaa kahana he ki, ‘‘saamaajik manovigyaan ko duusare vyaktiyon dwaara prabhavit vyakti kii kriyaaon ko vaigyanik adhyayan kahkar paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 '' uparokt paribhaashaon ko dekhte hue ham spashtatah kah sakate hai ki saamaajik manovaigyanik yah jaanane kaa prayaas karte hai ki vyakti ek duusare ke bare main kaise sochate hai tathaa kaise ek duusare ko prabhavit karte hai
 The nature of social psychology is scientific
 jab ham kisi bhi vishay ko vaigyanik kehete hai, to uski kuch visheshtaayen hoti hai, or un visheshtaon ke saath hi saath us vishay ke adhyayan ke antargat vibhinn vidhiyaan hoti hai, jinka prayog sambandhit vishyon ke adhyayan main kiya jaataa he raubart e
 bairan tathaa don byrn ne in visheshtaon yaa vijakosh mulyon ko is prakaar bataaya he, kisi bhi vishay ke vaigyanik hone ke liye ve aavashyak hai- Accuracy vishayparakta Skepticism and tatasthta
 Explaining these four, he says that - Accuracy means a commitment to gain and evaluate information about the world in as careful, clear and flawless manner as possible

 On the basis of the problems that social psychology studies at a particular time, its general field of study can be best exposed
