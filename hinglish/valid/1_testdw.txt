 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate
 gayasuddin tululaq kii mrityu ke baad uskaa putr 'june khaan', mohammad bin tululaq ke naam se dilli kii gaddi par baitha
 Its original name was 'ulugh Khan'
 rajamundari ke ek abhilekh main mohammad tululaq ko duniya kaa khan kaha gaya he
 Probably Muhammad Tughlaq was the most educated, learned and qualified person among all the sultans of medieval times
 apni sanak bhari yojanaon, krur-krityon evam duusare ke sukh-dukh ke prati upeksha kaa bhav rakhane ke kaaran ise 'swapnsheel', 'pagal' evam 'rakt-pipaasu' kaha gaya he
 Sultans have been declared unrighteous by historians like Barani, Sirhindi, Nizamuddin, Badauni and Farishta
 singhaasana par baithne ke baad tululaq ne amiron evam saradaaron ko vibhinn oopaadhiyaan evam pad pradaan kiya
 He gave the title of 'bahram Khan' to Tatar Khan, the title of 'imad-ul-mulk' to Malik Qabool and 'wazir-e-mumalik', but later he got the title of Gujarat with the title of 'khane Jahan'
 Was created usne malik aruyaaj ko khwaja jahaan kii oopaadhi ke saath ‘shahana-e-imaarat’ kaa pad, moulana gayasuddin ko 'kutulug khaan' kii oopaadhi ke saath 'vakil-e-dar' kii padavi, apane chachere bhai firoj shah tululaq ko 'naayab barbak' kaa pad pradaan kiya tha
 Muhammad bin Tughlaq was one of the most intelligent, intelligent, religious, fair-minded, art-loving and experienced commander among all the Sultans of Delhi
 vah arabi bhashaa evam farsi bhashaa kaa viddhan tathaa khagolashastra, darshan, ganit, chikitsa, vigyaan, tarkshastra aadi main paarangat tha
 Like Alauddin Khilji, at the beginning of his reign, he neither accepted his position from the Caliph nor took the support of the Ulema class, though it had to do so later
 usne nyaay vibhaag par ulema varg kaa ekadhipaty samaapt kiya
 Qazi's decision with which he was not satisfied changed it
 sarvapratham mohammad tululaq ne hi bina kisi bhedbhaav ke yogyata ke aadhaar par padon kaa aavanton kiya
 Adopted a policy of appointing officers on the basis of merit by eliminating race and class discrimination
 vastut: yah us shaasha kaa durbhaagya tha ki, uski yojanaayen safaltaapurvak kriyanvit nahin hui
 Due to which it became the subject of criticism from historians
 mohammad tululaq ke singhaasana par baithte samay dilli sultanate kul 23 praanton main banta thi, jinamein mukhya the - dilli, devgiri, lahore, multan, sarmuti, gujarat, avadh, kannauj, lakhanauti, bihar, malwa, jajanagar, dwarasamudr aadi
 Kashmir and Balochistan were also included in the Delhi Sultanate
 dilli sultanate kii seemaa kaa sarvaadhik vistaar isi ke shasankaal main hua tha
 But due to its cruel policy, rebellion started in the state
 jiske falswaroop dakshin main nae swatantra rajya kii sthapana hui or ye kshetra dilli sultanate se alag ho gaye
 Bengal also became independent
 rajarohan ke baad mohammad tululaq ne kuch naveen yojanaon kaa nirmaan kar unhen kriyanvit karne kaa praytn kiya
 like - apni pratham yojana ke dwaara mohammad tululaq ne doaab ke upjaau pradesh main kar kii vruddhi kar di, parantu usee varsh doaab main bhayankar akaal pad gaya, jisase paidaavaar prabhavit hui
 The rebellion in the area led to a rebellion by the Tughlaq officials, which failed the Tughlaq's plan
 mohammad tululaq ne krishi ke vikaas ke liye ‘diwan-e- amir kohi’ naamak ek naveen vibhaag kii sthapana kii
 Due to corruption of government employees, indifference of farmers, lack of good land, etc
, after three years, their plan for agricultural progress was terminated
 mohammad bin tululaq ne kisaanon ko bahut kam byaaj par rin uplabdh karaayaa
 Tughlaq shifted the capital from Delhi to Devgiri under his second plan
 devgiri ko “kuvvatul islam” bhi kaha gaya
 Sultan Qutubuddin Mubarak Khilji named Devagiri as 'qutbabad' and Muhammad bin Tughlaq changed its name to Daulatabad
 sultan kii is yojana ke liye sarvaadhik aalochana kii gai
 There is a great controversy among historians on the reasons for the change of capital by Muhammad Tughlaq, yet it can be concluded that, Devagiri is situated in the center of Delhi Sultanate, safe from the fear of Mongol invaders, such a stretch towards prosperity of South India etc
 There were reasons why the Sultan thought of changing the capital
 mohammad tululaq kii yah yojana bhi purnatah asafal rahi or usne 1335 i
 main daulatabad se logon ko dilli waapas aane kii anumati de di
 The change of capital resulted in the development of Muslim culture in the South, which eventually opened the way for the rise of the Bahmani Empire
 anubhav maury Under the third plan, Muhammad Tughlaq introduced symbolic and symbolic coins
 sikke sambandhi vividh prayogon ke kaaran hi edward tamas ne use ‘dhanavaanon kaa rajkumaar’ kaha he
 Muhammad Tughlaq introduced the coin named 'dokani'
 barani ke anusaar sambhavtah sultan ne rajkosh kii riktata ke kaaran evam apni samrajya vistaar kii niti ko safal banane hetu sankethik mudra kaa prachlan karavaaya
 Under the sign currency, the sultan probably introduced coins of brass and copper metals, which were worth the rupee of silver
 sikaa dhaalane par rajya kaa niyantran nahin rahane se anek jaali taksaal ban gayi
 Lagaan was given out with fake coins, which caused the economy to collapse
 sankethik mudra chalaane kii prerana china tathaa iran se mili
 The rulers there carried out these schemes successfully, while Muhammad Tughlaq's experiment failed
 sultan ko apni is yojana kii asafalataa par bhayanak aarthik kshati kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Under the fourth plan, the Khurasan and Karachil conquests of Muhammad Tughlaq are mentioned
 khurasana ko jeetne ke liye mohammad tululaq ne 3,70,000 sainikon kii vishaal sena ko ek varsh kaa agrim vetan de diya, parantu raajnneetik parivartan ke kaaran donon deshon ke madhya samjhauta ho gaya, jisase sultan kii yah yojana asafal rahi or use aarthik rup se haani uthaani padi
 Under the Karachil campaign, the Sultan sent a large army under the leadership of Khusro Malik to conquer the hill states
 uski puri sena junglee raaston main bhatak gai, ebn batuta ke anusaar antatah keval das adhikari hi bachakar waapas aa sake
 Thus this plan of Muhammad Tughlaq also failed
 sambhavtah 1328-29 i
 ke madhya mongol akramanakari tarmasharin chaghtai ne ek vishaal sena ke saath bharat par akraman kar multan, lahore se lekar dilli tak ke pradeshon ko rond daalaa
 It is believed that Sultan Muhammad Tughluq returned the bribe to the Mongol leader
 It is also believed that the Mongol leader bribed the Sultan to undermine the status of the Delhi Sultan himself and similarly for the Mongol rule
 Granted
 unke bich jo bhi hua, mongol netaa ke prati is samajhote kii niti ke kaaran sultan ko aalochana kaa shikaar bananaa padaa
 It is true that after this, there was never a Mongol invasion of India during the time of Muhammad Tughluq and that because of his ambitious failed plans, Muhammad Tughluq is called the 'king of failures'

 gurutvkarshan ek padaarth dwaara ek duusare kii ore aakrisht hone kii pravriti he
 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct
 unhone gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance

 He was of the view that "poetry is an imitation of the world, the world itself is an imitation; therefore the poem is twice as far from the truth
 vah bhaavon ko udwelit kar vyakti ko kumargami banaati he
 Hence the poem is unusable and the importance of the poet is less than a cobbler

 His dialogues can be divided into three parts- plato kii rachanaaon main 'da republic', 'da statsman', 'da laag', 'eon', 'chimposium' aadi pramukh hai

 isamen mathura, vrindavan, govardhan, gokul, mahaban, valdev, nandagaanv, varasanaa, deeg or kambon aadi bhagwaan shrikrishna ke sabhi lila-sthal sammilit hai
 The range of the said Braj has been considered as eighty-four Kos

 The place where cows graze and roam is also called Braj
 amarkosh ke lekhak ne braj ke teen arth prastut kiye hai- goshth, maarg or vrund 
 The word Braj in Hindi is derived from the word Vraj in Sanskrit
 vaidic samhitaon tathaa ramayana, mahabharat aadi sanskrit ke pracheen dharmagranthon main braj shabd goshaala, go-sthaan, gochar bhoomi ke arthon main bhi prayukt hua he
 In the Rigveda, the word is described as a gaushala or a khirak of cows
 yajurveda main gaayon ke charne ke sthaan ko braj or goshaala ko goshth kaha gaya he
 Braj is indicated by the location of the beautiful horned cows in the Shuklayajurveda
 atharvaveda main goshlaon se sambadhit puraa sookt hi prastut he
 In Harivamsa and Bhagavatpuranas, this word is used as Gop Basta
 skandapurana main maharishi shanndilya ne braj shabd kaa arth vthapit vatalate hue ise vyapak brahm kaa rup kaha he
 Therefore, this word is related to the spirituality of Braj

 Whether it is a farm to tie cows, whether it is cowshed, whether it is a land of land and whether it is a cottage
 bhagwatkaar kii drushti main goshth, gokul or braj samanarthak hai
 Braj has been used in the same sense in the compositions of Surdas based on the Bhagavata
 mathura or uskaa nikatavarti bhu-bhaag pracheen kaal se hi apane saghan wanon, vistrut charaagahon, goshton or sundar gaayon ke liye prasiddh rahaa he
 Although Lord Krishna was born in the city of Mathura, he was sent to the gop-slum across the Yamuna as soon as he was born due to political reasons, he lived in a large Gopalak's house along with Gop, Gopi and go-vrind
 
 us kaal main unke paalak nandadi gop gana apni suraksha or gochar-bhoomi kii suvidha ke liye apane gokul ke saath mathura nikatavarti vistrut van-khandon main ghumaa karte the
 Due to Shri Krishna, the importance of those cow-gopis, cows and trans-lands was increased
 puranic kaal se lekar vaishnav sampradaayon ke aavirbhaav kaal tak jaise-jaise krishnopasna kaa vistaar hota gaya, vaise-vaise shrikrishna ke ukt parikron tathaa unke lila sthalon ke gaurav kii bhi vruddhi hoti gai
 There was an abundance of cow rearing here during this period, due to which Vrajkhandas also became abundant
 isaliye shri krishna ke janm sthaan mathura or unki lilaon se samvadhit mathura ke aas-paas kaa samast pradesh hi braj athwa brajamandal kaha jane laga tha
 In this way the meaning of the word Braj has evolved in chronological order
 vedon or ramayana-mahabharat ke kaal main jahaan iskaa prayog 'goshth'-'go-sthaan' jaise laghu sthal ke liye hota tha
 In the mythological period, some big places like 'gop-basti' started to be done

 16veen shatabdi main 'braj' pradeshvai hokar 'brajamandal' ho gaya or tav uskaa aakaar 84 kos kaa mana jane laga tha
 At that time Mathura city was not considered to be included in 'braj'
 surdaas tathaa anya braj-bhashaa kaviyon ne 'braj' or mathura kaa pruthak rup main hi kathan kiya he, jaise pahile ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 The size of Braj also expanded when the area of braj culture and Brajbhasha expanded due to Krishna worshipers and Brajbhasha poets
 us samay mathura nagar hi nahin, balki usase dur-dur ke bhu-bhaag, jo braj samskruti or braj-bhashaa se prabhavit the, vraj antargat maan liye gayi the
 Present kaal main mathura nagar sahit mathura jile kaa adhikansh bhaag tathaa rajasthan ke deeg or kambon kaa kuch bhaag, jahaan se brajayatra guzarati he, braj kaha jaataa he
 The area of braj culture and Braj language is even more extensive
 ukt samast bhu-bhaag re pracheen naam, madhuban, shurasen, madhura, madhupuri, mathura or mathuramandal the tathaa aadhunik naam braj yaa brajamandal hai

 is paribhaasha se spasht he ki iskaa maan shunya or 1 ke bich hoga
 According to a 2009 UNESCO report, below are the language diversity indices of some countries - nagaraj raaj comics kii peshkash, ek bhartiya comic book kirdaar he jise yaqinan lambey samay se jivit bhartiya ection comic super hero kaha ja saktaa he
 Created by Sanjay Gupta in the late 1980s, Nagraj has drastically changed both the look as well as the story in his 25 years of life
 is tathy ke baavjood ki kisi samay bharat main comic samskruti lagbhag gaayab ho gai thi, phir bhi uske prashansak aadhaar main vruddhi hui or uski pehali anemated film ke jari hone ke baad isamen jabardast badhotaree kii ummid he
 The first issue of Nagaraja was written by the well-known writer Parashuram Sharma and was illustrated by Pratap Malik
 malik ne 1995 tak lagbhag 50 ankon ke liye is charitra kaa safaltaapurvak chithran kiya tha
 From 1995 onwards, illustration was taken over by illustrator and writer Anupam Sinha
 aaj nagaraj jo kuch bhi he, vah bhartiya comic udyog ke in diggaj pratap malik or anupam sinha kii vajah se he
 The character of Nagaraja is believed to be inspired by the mythical wishful serpent, the historical venomous human
 uski kahaniyon main puraana, kalpana, jaadu or vigyaan galp kaa samrudh mishran he
 Many fans of Nagaraja believe that over time Nagaraja comics have developed a serpent myth of their own which is unique to popular Indian beliefs about snakes among the masses
 nagaraj kii multah kalpana antarrashtriya aatankwaad ke ek dushman ke rup main kii gai thi
 Interestingly, in its first issue, Nagaraj was promoted as an international terrorist weapon by the evil scientist Professor Nagmani
 nagaraj ko is pehle mishan main adivasee bhakton, sanpon or rahasyamay 300 se bhi zyaada umr ke gorakhnath baba naamak buudhe sadhu se sangrakshit ek mandir se devi kii murti churaane kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya tha
 Nagaraja succeeded in his task, but was defeated against Gorakhnath and his mysterious black mongoose Shikangi
 gorakhnath ne uskaa man pard liya or pataa lagaaya ki profosar naagamani ne nagaraj ko apane niyantran main rakhane ke liye uske sir main ek capsule ke rup main man ko niyantrit karne vaale yantra kaa pratyaropan kiya he
 Gorakhnath underwent surgery and removed the capsule from Nagaraj's head, freeing Nagraj from the control of Professor Nagmani
 iske baad nagaraj baba gorakhnath kaa shishy ban gaya or usne prithvi se aparaadh or aatankwaad ko khatm karne kii qasam khai
 tab se nagaraj ne teen baar vishwa kaa daura kiya or kai khalnaayakon or aatankwaadiyon ko haraaya
 Samprati Nagraj in a fictional city metropolis with his own secretly owned TV
 The channel's employee is living as Raj
 pracheen kaal main jab devtaa bina kisi pratibandh ke prithvi par vicharan karte the, tab vahaan takshaknagar naamak ek samrajya maujuud tha jis par raja takshakraj or rani lalita kaa shashan tha
 The ruling couple had no concern except one; They did not have any child
 rajkumaar yaa rajkumaari kii anupasthiti ne ekmaatr nagapasha ko uskaa sambhavit vaaris banaaya
 nagapasha samraat kaa samroop chota bhai tha, jo yah jaanakar ki keval vahi singhaasana kaa sambhavit uttaradhikari he, chintarahit bhavy jivan jeene laga tha
 As time passed, the queen became depressed due to the absence of her child
 The king understood the reason for the depression of the queen and they also started being upset
 The husband and wife used to worship their family deity Dev Kalajayi for Ashish
 dev kaaljayi ko bhi unke dukh kaa kaaran pataa tha, atah ek din unhone mahaan santan paane kaa unhen aashirwad diya
 Her blessing was successful and soon the queen became pregnant and a wave of happiness ran across the state except for Nagpash
 is santan ke janm kaa matlab uske liye singhaasana khona tha, atah bachche ke paidaa hone se pehle hi use maarane kaa usne nirnay liya
 One day while Rani Dev was going to worship Kalajayi, Nagpash replaced Prasad with a dead mongoose in a covered plate of the deity's offering
 nagdevataa ko gussa aa gaya or unhone apni vifailli saans se rani ko behosh kar diya
 The king apologizes to the deity and begs to cure his wife but the deity refuses to do so, after which desperate Raj attempts to commit suicide
 bhakt kii mrityu jhelane main aksham, dev kaaljayi ne unhen rani kii jaan bachaane kaa ek upaay bataaya
 unhone raja ko mani di or use rani kii dawa se abhikriya karne ke liye kaha
 mani rani ke sharir se sara vish bachche ke sharir kii ore palat degaa, lekin vish ke bure prabhaav ke kaaran rani apni prajnan kshamta kho degi
 Mourning prevailed throughout the kingdom and the king also became unhappy
 nagapasha bahut khush tha ki vah akele vaaris ke rup main batch gaya he
 When the child was born, everyone thought that he was dead because his whole body was blue and no signs of life were seen in it
 hinduon kii pratha ke anusaar navjaat shishu ko nadi main phenk diya gaya
 Nagpash happily woke up and went straight to the drunken Dev Kalajayi and asked him to hand over the royal treasury, stating that he was the sole heir to the throne and hence he had authority over the royal treasury
 dev kaaljayi ne inkaar kar diya or usase kaha ki singhaasana kaa "asli uttaradhikari" jivit he or jab samay aae tab khajaana use saunp diya jayega
 naaraaz hokar nagapasha ne devtaa ke viruddh apni talwaar uthaai lekin vishaal saanp kii poonch ke maatr jatke se dur ja gira
 nagapasha do katoron par gira, ek main behad jaharila vish tha, jisane uske chehre ko nasht kar diya gaya or uske khun main mil gaya or duusare main amrit tha, jisane use amar bana diya
 The simultaneous influence of the two made Nagpash an immortal venomous man
 us samay nagapasha apane sharir ke badlaav ko sahan nahin kar sakaa or behosh ho gaya
 When Dev Kalajayi informed the king about these events, he came to know that his son was not dead and he also realized the possible dangers towards his life
 atah unhone tilism ke mahaan gyani apane vafaadaar jyotishi vedacharya ko aadesh diya ki ve khazaane ko aise tilism main sangrakshit karen, jise keval unka betaa tod sake
 vedacharya ne dev kaaljayi ke sahyog se tilism taiyaar kiya taaki sunishchit ho ki sivaay raja ke bete ke koi us tilism ko todane main sakasham na ho, amar nagapasha bhi nahin
 jab nagapasha ko hosh aayaa to usne mahasoos kiya ki vah khajaana kho chukaa he
 Angry, he killed the king and queen
 jivan-kriya rahit sthiti main shishu nadi main bahata hua jhaadiyon main jaakar funs gaya
 He stayed there for a long time
 is bich sarp devtaa dev kaaljayi chiraayu ichhadhari naagon ke shaasha raja maniraj or unki patni manika rani ke sapanom main prakat hue, jo maanviya drushti se ojhal nagadweep naamak hind mahaasaagar ke ek dweep main chhip kar jivan bitaa rahe the
 He told the baby's location and asked them to treat him
 He did as he was told and found the baby, and he also came to know that he was more toxic than the great serpent Mahatma, the island's great serpent, indicating that he possessed the divine poison of God
 shuru main raaj vaidya anishchit the ki ve shishu kaa ilaaj kar paaenge yaa nahin, lekin swayan dev kaaljayi ne raja se ilaaj ke liye kaha tha isliye ve aashwast hue ki unka upachaar safal hoga
 niyamon ke anusaar, kisi ko bhi is dweep main kisi bahari vyakti ko laane kii anumati nahin thi, isliye raja ne uski upasthiti ko gupt rakhane kaa faisalaa liya
 Many years passed and the results of the treatment started to appear, although there was still no life-activity in it, but the color of the baby gradually started changing to green
 The king gave this news to the queen and they decided to adopt the child as they had no children of their own
 unke nirnay ko dusht tantric vishandhar ne sun liya jo dweep kaa shaasha bananaa chahta tha, lekin mahatma kaldoot se darataa tha
 He attacked the secret area where the infant was kept and ran away with him, but fearing the wrath of God decided not to kill the infant and placed him back in the river bushes where he was found
 uski yojana vifal hui kyonki jald hi rani ne garbh dhaaran kiya or ek beti ko janm diya, jiskaa naam visarpi rakhaa gaya
 Vyasandhar never realized that the baby he had left to wander came to his senses, first his face and then his body like normal humans and he started crying
 paas ke mandir ke ek pujari ne use dekha or use profesar naagamani ko bhent swaroop diya jo paas ke jangal main sanpon kii talash main bhatak rahaa tha
 For unknown reasons, Purohit tells a false story that the infant is of a woman who was raped and who was a devotion to the serpent god and that the child is blessed to become a willful serpent and requested Nagamani to raise him something In such a way that he can avenge his mother
 naagamani ne samaj liya ki pujari jhooth bol rahe hai lekin vah shishu ko apane saath le gaya
 The baby's blood test showed that his white blood cells contained microscopic snakes instead of blood
 shishu main asaadhaaran rogahar shaktiyaan thi or vah atyant vishaiylla tha
 He raised a child who later became Nagraj
 nagaraj ko naagamani profesar kii ek sristi ke rup main vishwa ke samaksh prastut kiya gaya
 He was being made a unique assassin machine and his original plan was to hire Nagraj as the highest bidder among villains and terrorist groups around the world
 profesar naagamani ne apane anya praayogic pariyojnaon or antarrashtriya aatankwaad ke liye patte par uskaa istemaal kiya
 Nagmani always claimed that his powers were developed by giving Nagaraja parts of the snake venom, poisoning him
 unhone daawa kiya ki uskaa vish 1000 vibhinn prajatiyon ke saanp ke kaatane kaa parinaam he or uski shaktiyaan mrit ichhadhari naag ke bhasma se ilaaj se viksit hui hai
 The fact was that Nagaraja was more poisonous than any snake species, because his venom was supernatural
 mote taur par aakaar badalane vaale hindu myth ke aadhaar par, nagaraj apni rakt koshikaon main palane vaale sookshm sanpon se shakti paata tha or use vifailli saans vish-phunkaar or kaat, tatkaal upachaar shaktiyaan or uski kalai se alag se nikalne vaale yaa rassiyaan, parachute tathaa uski kalpana ke anusaar vibhinn aakaar grahan karne vaale sanpon jaisi asankhya alokik shaktiyaan praapt hai
 It is believed that if he bites someone or someone bites him, then his venom has the power to smelt the body of any living animal, even sharper than potassium cyanide
 apane pehle mishan ke liye, use das lakh main bechaa gaya tha or uddeshy ek pracheen pratimaa ko hasil karnaa tha
 Nagaraja succeeds, but then the monk "baba Gorakhnath" fails him, freeing his mind from the control of "professor Nagamani"
 gorakhnath kii ek nai shanti kii duniya main jaag kar, nagaraj vishwa se aatankwaad ko samaapt karne kii qasam khaataa he or apana lakshya hasil karne kii disha main aage badhata he
 Nagaraj's powers were also limited in the early numbers, sometimes he was defeated by powerful human opponents and temporarily fainted, his strength was also very human like that of his opponents seeing a car picker
 Was taken aback by the power of barason baad nagaraj itnaa shaktishaalee ho gaya ki vah na keval akele girti hui kaaron ko tham letaa tha balki aasaani se chizon ko bahya antariksh main phenk detaa tha
 It is notable and perhaps even ironic that Nagaraja is now transformed into a mythological-magical creature who has to face fantastical creatures as his enemies, including elements of witchcraft and time and space travel
 Huh
 kai log ise nagaraj comics kii nirantar, jabardast lokapriyata main vruddhi ke kaaran ke rup main dekhte hai
 However, purists still claim that they prefer more realistic and more practical stories from which Nagaraja originated
 nagaraj yakeenan raaj jagat kaa sabase adhik shaktishaalee super hero he or apane samay kaa sabase shaktishaalee ichhadhari naag
 baar-baar, usne sheshnag, vasukidev, kaaljayi mahaan sarp devataaon ko chunauti dene kii kshamta dikhaai he or kaldoot, triphana, mahavyal or sheetanag kumaar jaise naagon ko parrast kiya he, jo apni prajati ke sabase taqatvar naagon main gine jate hai
 Nagaraja in his early numerals was a wanderer who, like an avalanche, wreaked havoc for the enemies of mankind
 chunki chhadam vyaktitv kii zarurat nahin thi, nagaraj ke paas koi maujuud nahin tha, lekin vah apni pahchaan chhipaane ke liye khud ko ek overkot main or aksar ek topi se chipa detaa tha
 The costume he used to disguise his true identity, he was given the name of disguise by his fans because often no one came to know that the person standing before him was Nagraj himself
 nagaraj ne apane naveenatam vaishvik aatankwaad series main isi chhadam vyaktitv ko apanaaya he
 Nagaraj takes off his hat and overcoat in public immediately due to fear of not being identified in an emergency
 uskaa vigat chhadam vyaktitv tha raaj, jo kahani main prastut kaalpanik company bharti communications main anaadi kism kaa sampark adhikari tha
 He pretends to be afraid of snakes, in his secret identity
 vah chashma or theth bijnes suut pahentaa he tathaa bahut hi darpok or saral vyakti he
 It is very similar to the character of Superman / Clark Kent, whose costumes, hair sorting and the use of goggles to disguise themselves are similar
 haalanki praarambhik chhadam vyaktitv fatum par aadhaarit tha, yah chhadam vyaktitv superman par aadhaarit he
 Recently forced to reveal his true identity in the series "after Nagraj", Nagaraja had to change his pseudo personality again due to circumstances
 He now works as the manager of the new security agency "snake Eyes" according to the current storyline
 uskaa nayaa naam he nagaraj singh
 yah sushri saudangi ke swaamitv main he jo uske sharir main rahati he or ichhadhari naag he
 In Nagaraj comics, innumerable enemies of Nagaraja have appeared, many were killed, but some survived to reappear
 Here is a list of the major surviving enemies of Nagraj, who can be expected to return in future scores: apane karmon se nagaraj ne kai dost banaae, jinamein kai keval ek baar dikhaai die, kuch anek baar or bahut kam uski kahaniyon main jagah banaate hue, yada-kada prakat hote hue sthai kirdaar ban gaye

 See Amy Nether's theorem
 Other less significant laws are the mathematical consequences of the above conservation laws for derivative physical quantities : Chemical laws are those laws of nature relevant to chemistry
 The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the law of conservation of mass, which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary chemical reaction
 Modern physics shows that it is actually energy that is conserved, and that energy and mass are related; a concept which becomes important in nuclear chemistry
 Conservation of energy leads to the important concepts of equilibrium, thermodynamics, and kinetics
 Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass
 Joseph Proust's law of definite composition says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important
 Dalton's law of multiple proportions says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers; Although in many systems the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction
 More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and transformations
 Thermodynamics kwantem yantriki It is thought that the successful integration of Einstein's field equations with the uncertainty principle and Schrödinger equation, something no one has achieved so far with a testable theory, will lead to a theory of quantum gravity, the most basic physical law sought after today

 First in England, in 1811, arrangements were made for the education of Sanskrit language at Oxford University
 iske liye ek kattar isai saamne aayaa
 He was Colonel Joseph Boden, who was a lieutenant-colonel in the East India Company's army in Bombay

 The purpose of the Boden Chair, like the Gurukuls of India, was not merely to teach the Sanskrit language from a literary point of view, but to serve the religious interests of Britain's political and Christian missionaries
 karnal boden ne apni vasiyat, jo ki 15 agast 1811 ko cantarbari, euke ke nyaayalay main registerd kii gai, uske mukhay ansh or uddeshy is prakaar hai: That is, i donate to all my Oxford University

 Thus in 1811, the Sanskrit Chair was established at the University of Oxford, but no person could be found for it at that time

 Based on this Sanskrit knowledge, Wilson was made the first Sovereign of the Boden Chair of Sanskrit at Oxford University in 1832
 yahan usne sabase pehle mishnariyon ke liye di religen and philosophical system of di hindooj naamak pustak likhi
 About the purpose of writing this book, he said: arthath yah lekhamala un vyaktiyon kii sahaayta ke liye likhi gai hai jo ki mu dwaara sthapit do saun pound ke puraskaar ke liye pratyaashee hon or jo hindu dharm granthon kaa sarvottam prakaar se khandan kar saken
 In 1860, after Prof
 Wilson's death, the second chairman of the Boden Chair was Mounier Williams
 1819 main bombay main janma maunier ek kattar isai tha
 It was even more committed to destroying Hinduism as he wrote in his book 'A sanskrit-english Dictionary': "in explanation i must draw attention to the fact that i am only the second occupant of the Boden Chair, and that its founder, Col
 Boden, stated most explicitly in his will that the special object of his munificent bequest was to promote the translation of the Scripture in Sanskrit so as to enable his countrymen to procet'd in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion
" "it was on this account that, when my distinguished predecessor and teacher, Professor HH Wilson, was a candidate for the chair in 1832, his lexicographical labors were put forward as his principal claim to election
" "surely it" need not be thought surprising, if following in the footsteps of my venerated master, i have made it the chief aim of my professional life to provide facilities for the translation of the Sacred Scriptures in Sanskrit and for the promotion of a better knowledge of the religions and customs of India, as the best key to a knowledge of the religious needs of our great Eastern Dependency
 My very first public lecture delivered after my election in 1860 was on "the Study of Sanskrit in Relation to Missionary Work in India" 
 That is to say, i would like to draw attention to the fact that i am only the second head of the boden-chair and its founder Colonel Boden has written most clearly in his will that the specific purpose of his will is to translate Sanskrit theology
 So that the people of his country would be able to convert the original inhabitants of India into Christianity

 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times

 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization

 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization

 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world

 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage

 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep

 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks

125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard

 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic

 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
