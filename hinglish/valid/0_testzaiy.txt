 is jaanch kaa uddeshy yah jaankaree karnaa hota he ki sanstha kaa ek nishchit samay ke liye banaaya gaya chittha tathaa laabh-haani khaataa uski thik tathaa sahi sthiti ko prakat karata he athwa nahin

 e dablyoo hanson- sampoorn lekhon kii aisi jaanch ko ankekshan kehete he jinase ki un par vishwaas kiya ja sake tathaa unke dwaara bataaye hue vivaranon par bhi vishwaas kiya ja saken
 In conclusion based on the above definitions- ankekshan kisi vyapaarik sanstha kii hisaab-kitaab kii pustakon kii vishisht evam vivechanaatmak jaanch he, jo ek yogya tathaa nishpaksh vyakti dwaara sanstha se praapt pramankon, prapatron soochnaaon tathaa spashtikarnon kii sahaayta se kii jaati he, jisase ki ankekshak ek nishchit samay ke liye banaaye hue hisaab-kitaab ke sambandh main yah report de sake ki, Institution - The audit of any institution can be done
 swatantra vyakti- ankekshan kaary kisi aise vyakti dwaara hona chahie jiskaa vyapaar athwa sanstha se kisi bhi prakaar kaa sambandh na ho
 Only then a fair investigation is possible
 at: vartmaan main chartered lekhapal kii niyukti kii gai hai
 Form of the investigation- The test conducted by the audit does not only reveal the accuracy related to mathematics, but it is an intelligent unbiased test which shows the absolute accuracy of the calculation
 lekha pustaken- ankekshan main lekha-pustakon kii jaanch hoti he
 The auditor does not have to restrict his field of work to only books, but also has to know other statutory books and various facts
 pramank evam prapatr- lekha pustakon kii jaanch pramankon evam prapatron ke aadhaar par kii jaati he, yadi yah uplabdh na hon to inaki pratilipiyon se pushti kii jaati hai
 Information and Explanation - The basis of the inquiry is the evidence itself, but if the auditor is not satisfied with the memorization certificate, then for verification of the transactions one can ask for information and clarification
 budhimattapurna- ankekshan dwaara kii jane vaali jaanch kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn he at: is kaary main buddhi evam chaturaai kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo is kaary ke anubhav se praapt hoti he
 Purpose of checking- The purpose of checking the books of accounts is to verify the results of the profit and loss account created in a certain period and the assets and obligations shown in the letter on a certain date and give a certificate on satisfaction
 vastav main ankekshak ko antim khaaton kii jaanch par apni raay prakat kerani hoti he
 Regularity - Under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, some important rules should be kept in mind while creating the company's letter and profit and loss account
 at: company ankekshak ko apni report main likhnaa hota he ki chittha niyamaanukool he athwa nahin
 Period- Auditing is generally done for accounts of one financial year or one accounting year
 yadi ek se adhik varsh ke lekhon kaa ankekshan kiya jaataa he to yah jaanch anusandhan kehalaati he
 Result- After checking the articles, a report has to be given regarding its veracity and appropriateness
 yadi ankekshak kisi baat se asantusht he to iskaa varnan spasht rup se apni report main karata he
 As an accounting imperative, accounting in practical terms is essential to keep the business alive and to gain prestige in the society
 iske liye nimnlikhit tark diye ja sakate hai : In today's era, accurate knowledge of profit or loss from a business is not a concept without accounting
 vyavsaayee kii aarthik sthiti suddadh va aarthik saadhan bahut achche hon, to bhi anya vyavsaayee ke mukaable sasti bechney ke falswaroop bikri adhik ho lekin sirf diwaala nikalne par hi use pataa chalegaa ki usne vastu ko laagat se bhi kam main bech diya he
 There are more transactions in the business, especially where the goods are sold more on credit, it is not possible to remember the names of the debtors, so accounting is mandatory
 ek nishchit avadhi kii samaapti par laabh hua athwa haani
 Accounting is mandatory for this
 vyavsaayik lekha-pustaken yadi sucharu tareeke se rakhi jaayen to chaluvarsh kii aay-vyay yaa laabh-haani kii tulana pichley varshon ke laabh-haani se kii ja sakati he
 Through accounting, the trader gets to know his financial position
 kar-nirdhaaran main lekhon kaa bahut mahatv he
 If the accounts are kept according to the rules then these are very helpful
 ek vyapaaree ko kin-kin vyaktiyon ko kul kitna rupaya dena he, yah soochna lekhankan se hi mil sakati he
 More profit can be made by starting unprofitable actions except for non-profitable actions and if there is a deficiency in efficiency then they can be overcome by knowing their reasons
 yah kaary lekhakarm dwaara hi sambhav he
 If proper books of accounts are kept in a business, then the reputation of that business increases
 lekhankan ke nimnlikhit laabh bhi hai : ACCOUNTING LUXURY AS chote vyapaariyon ke liye ise vilasita mana gaya he kyonki inaki simit aavashyaktaaen hoti hai kintu vartmaan samay main yah purna rup se uchit prathit nahin hoti he
 Auditing as Luxury lagaana he phir bhi hisaab-kitaab main chal-kapat chhipe rah jate he, jo ankekshak uchit chaturaai va saavdhaanee ke baavjood nahin pakad saktaa hai
 Hence the audit is meaningless
 uparokt tathyon ke aadhaar par ham kah sakate hai ki chote-chote vyapaar main ankekshan vilasita he lekin sabhi vyavsaayon ke liye ankekshan ko vilasita kahana galat hoga
 Small organizations where there are one or two employees and the owner of accounting is looked after by a sole trader or partner, so auditing is not necessary, but in big business it is profitable and highly necessary, not luxury
 ankekshan kaa vilasita na hona Enhancing the efficiency of the employees - The efficiency of the employee increases as a result of the audit, because they know that an error can be detected by the auditor if the work is not done properly! karmchaariyon kii kaarykushalta main vruddhi-kushal ankekshan ke falswaroop karmchaariyon apane-apane kaary main daksh ho jate hai kyonki ankekshak samay-samay par apni report main tathaa ankekshan ke dauraan bhi kamiyon ko bataata rahata he va maargdarshan bhi karata rahata he
 Increase in efficiency of managers- When the managers know that the auditor will submit their report on the work done by them, which will be acceptable, they will do their work with full sincerity
 vyavsaay ke vikaas main sahaayak- ankekshit hisaab-kitaab par sabhi vishwaas karte hai tathaa isse vyapaar kii khyaati main vruddhi hoti he tathaa sabhi ore se vyavsaay ko suvidhaayen praapt hoti hai jisase vyavsaay kaa vikaas hota hai
 Decision in case of insolvency possible- If the books of accounts are properly conducted and audited, then the court can help in getting the debt relief order
 ho saktaa he iske abhaav main samay adhik lag jaay
 Assistants in future planning - The managers conduct comparative studies on the basis of the final accounts of several years and see how the efficiency can be increased
 plant evam mashin kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- laagat lekhon ke ankekshan se yah maaloom hota he ki mashiinon kii kitni kaaryakshmata he tathaa kin-kin kaarnon se mashiinon kii purna kaaryakshmata kaa prayog nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Efficiency can be increased by acquiring information about these reasons
 ankekshan kii anivaaryta Auditing affects efficiency, so it cannot be called luxury
 nimnakint dashaon main yah anivaary hai – Thus it would not be completely true to say that accounting is mandatory and auditing is a luxury
 chote vyapaar main kahin-kahin lekhankan bhi vilasita he jabaki bade vyavsaayon ke liye anivaary hi he
 But still accounting and auditing are two sides of a coin
 yadi lekhankan na ho to ankekshan kiskaa hoga
 And if accounting is alone then it does not have the credibility of its veracity
 truti karnaa maanav swabhaav kaa ek bhaag hai ankekshan kaa pramukh uddeshy bhi ashuddhi va gaban kaa pataa lagaana va unhen rokna hota hai
 Checking of preliminary articles, journal checking, checking of cash balances, checking of balances of accounts, checking of account books of subsidiary books, matching of previous year's floor, finding the amount of difference, to check the auditor's errors Can take action etc
 yadi ankekshak apane kaary main itani saavdhaanee, kushalta evam budhimaani kaa prayog kare jitna ki un paristhitiyon main sammav tha or usne purna praytn kiya ho jo ki trutiyon ko dhund nikaalane hetu param aavashyak tha
 If still unable to detect fraud, the auditor cannot be held liable
 ankekshan kaary kaa arth yah kabhi nahin hota 'ki ankekshak ne ashuddhiyon evam gaban kaa beemaa kar liya he, na hi vah is baat kii garanti detaa he ki samast ashuddhiyon evam gaban ko dhund nikaalega
 He is only expected to do his work with due care and cleverness

 This review and evaluation show whether: ankekshan prativedan main vittiya soochnaaon par raay kii spashtatah likhit abhivyakti kaa samavesh hona chahie

 To this end, the auditor follows such procedures to assure that the financial statements give a true and fair picture of the financial position and operating results of an enterprise
 ' The auditor, with his professional experience and decision-making ability, sets certain criteria for investigation, while doing so he cannot be expected to work outside his area of competence

 Limitations are as follows: - siddhanth kaa arth ek sarabhoot tathy, ek aadharbhoot niyam se he
 The principles of audit are such important truths that provide knowledge of the objectives of audit and explain the ways in which these can be met

 The Indus Valley Civilization is one of the major civilizations of the ancient river valley civilizations in the world
 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times
 7ve shatabdi main pehali baar jab logo ne punjab praant main ito ke liye mitti kii khudaai kii tab unhen vahaan se bani banaai ite mili jise logo ne bhagwaan kaa chamatkaar mana or unka upyog ghar banane main kiya uske baad1826 main charles mysen ne pehali baar is puraani sabhyataa ko khoja
 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established
 1904 main lard karjan dwaara jon marshall ko bhartiya puratathvik vibhaag kaa mahanideshak banaaya gaya
 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization
 1921 main dayaram saahani ne hadappa kaa utkhanan kiya
 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world
 is paripakv sabhyataa ke kendra-sthal punjab tathaa sindh main tha
 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage

 Only half a dozen of these can be called city

 Both places are in present-day Pakistan

 The third city was Mohen, which was 130 km south of Daro, at the site of Chanhudaro and the fourth city at a place called Lothal above the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat

 All these sites have views of mature and advanced Harappan culture

 The specialty of these two is to be a city fortress

 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke pramukh shahar teen deshon main is prakaar he:- The various cities of India have the following cities of the Indus Valley Civilization: - is sabhyataa kii sabase vishesh baat thi yahaan kii viksit nagar nirmaan yojana
 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15
23 me
 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard

 Different types of paintings were made on pottery with black color
 kapadaa banane kaa vyavsaay unnat avasthaa main tha
 It was also exported abroad
 johari kaa kaam bhi unnat avasthaa main tha
 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai
 He was familiar with the wheel and probably used a vehicle similar to today's aces
 ye afghanistan or iran se vyapaar karte the
 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic
 yahan swaastik ke chitra bhi mili he
 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
 jaise aaj hindu ganga main nahaane jate he vaise hi saindhav log yahan nahaakar pavitra hua karte the

 For the business, he needed a measuring weight and he also used it

 There is a feeling that this civilization was in its last phase decadent

 Scholars do not agree on the reasons for its destruction
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke avsaan ke peeche vibhinn tark diye jate hai jaise: akraman, jalwaayu parivartan evam paristhitik asantulan, barh tathaa bhu-tathvik parivartan, mahamari, aarthik kaaran
 It seems that there was not a single reason for the decline of this civilization, but because of a combination of different reasons
 jo alag alag samay main yaa ek saath hone ki sambhaavna he
 The city and drainage system in Mohenjo Daro seems less likely to have an epidemic

 udhaaharan Chaturangini - Ancient Indian organized army
 sena ke chaar ang- hasti, ashv, rath, padaati maane jate hai or jis sena main ye chaaron hai, vah chaturangini kehalaati he
 The word Chaturanbal is also found in the chronicles
 is vishay main saamaanya niyam yah he ki prayek rath ke saath 10 gaj, prayek gaj ke saath 10 ashv, prayek ashv ke saath 10 padaati rakshak ke rup main rahete the, is prakaar sena praaia: chaturangini hi hoti thi
 The smallest troop of the army is called 'patti', which consisted of one yard, one chariot, three horse, five materials
 aisi teen pattiyaan senamukh kehalaati thim
 In this way, the organization of Gulam, Gana, Vahini, Pritna, Chamu and Anikini was done three times
 10 anikini ek akshuhinee ke baraabar hoti thi
 Accordingly, an Akshauhini consisted of 21870 yards, 21970 chariots, 65610 horse and 109350 materials
 kul yoga 218700 hota tha
 It is said that 18 such Akshohini army fought in the battle of Kurukshetra

 The term design or design is used in applied arts, engineering, architecture and other similar creative works and fields
 ise kriya ke rup main evam sangya ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Design as a verb refers to the process that is adopted to bring or develop a product, structure, system or goods
 sangya ke rup main dizin shabd do arthon main prayukt hota he- Nowadays processes are also considered to be the result of design
 is arth main prakriya kii dizin kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Many goals are set under the design
 inamen pramukh aavashyaktaayen hai - kaary sambandhi, aakaar va aaytan sambandhi, mulya yaa laagat sambandhi, shakti kii aavashyaktaa sambandhi, rakrakhaav tathaa bigadne par sudhaar sambandhi, vibhinn bhaagon ko aapas main jodne main aasaani sambandhi, nirmaan evam utpaan main saralata aadi
 Design For the achievement of a predetermined goal, it is the 'design' to systematically organize the ideas and all the other related items
 vaastuvid kisi bhawan ke nirmaan kii yojana banaate hue rekhaon kaa vibhinn roopon main ankan kisi ek lakshya kii purti ko sochakar karata he
 The artist also tries to present a special effect or idea in the picture by combining lines
 isi prakaar imarti ejeeniyar kisi imaarat main sunishchit tikaaupan or dridhtaa laane ke liye uski vividh maapon ko niyat karata he
 All things are under design
 vaastuvid kaa kartavya he ki vah aisa vyavhaarya abhiklpana prastut kare jo bhavannirmaan kii lakshyapurti main suvidhajanak evam mitavyayi ho
 At the same time, he should also keep in mind that the size of the building should be compatible with the neighborhood of that area and can also match with the old buildings standing around Eid
 maan lijie, id-gird ke sabhi makaan mehrabadar daravajevaale hai, to unke bich ek sapaat daat ke daron kaa, sade dhang ke samnevaala makaan shobhaa nahin degaa
 Similarly, there are many other things which should be considered keeping in view the lateral environment
 duusari vishesh baat jo vaastuvid ke liye vichaarneey he, vah he bhawan ke bahari aakaar ke vishay main ek sthir mat kaa nirnay
 It should be such that even a person walking on the road should understand the building without asking what it is built for
 jaise, ek kalege ko aspataal sareekha nahin laganaa chahie or na hi aspataal kii akruti kalege sareekhee honi chahie
 The bunk building should look sturdy and safe and the exterior of the playhouse or cinema hall should be adorable
 vaastuvid ko yah sunishchit hona chahie ki usne us puure kshetra kaa bharpoor upyog kiya he jisapar use bhawan nirmit karnaa he
 Artistic designs also include painting of curtains for entertainment or theater, various types of paintings for decoration, making graffiti to express a particular idea
 kalakaar kii khubi isi main he ki vah apni abhiklpana ko yatharth aakaar de
 The painting should symbolize the living expression of the artist's thoughts
 chitra kii aavashyaktaa ke anusaar kalakaar pencil ke rekhachitr, tailchitr, pani ke rangon ke chitra aadi banaae
 The engineer of the buildings has to make his design according to the design of the architect so that the building is strong enough to handle all the loads falling on it
 is drushti se vah nirmaan ke liye vishisht upkarnon kaa chunaav karata he or aise nirmaan padaarth lagane kaa aadesh detaa he jisase imaarat sasti tathaa tikaoo ban sake
 For this, it is also necessary to keep in mind whether the specific materials recommended for manufacture are available in the market, or whether there is a lack of the desired efficiency to implement the suggested specific work styles
 bhaar kaa anumaan karne main swayan imaarat kaa bhaar, banate samay yaa uske upyog main aane par uskaa chal bhaar, chal bhaaron ke aghat kaa prabhaav, hawa kii daab, bukamp ke dhakkon kaa parinaam, taap, sankoch, neenv ke baithne aadi anek baton ko dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 Some of these weights can be calculated finely, but there are many that can only be estimated based on past experiences
 jaise bukamp ke bal ko len---iskaa anumaan bada kathin he or is baat kii koi purvakalpana nahin ho sakati ki bukamp kitne bal kaa or kahan par hoga
 However, luckily, the effect of most moving and fixed weights can be calculated quite accurately
 taap evam sankochajanit daabon kaa bhi paryaapt sahi anumaan puure rituchakra ke tapon main hone vaale vyatikramon ke adhyayan tathaa kancreet ke gyaat gunon dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The forces due to wind and earthquake are ultimately uncertain, but there is usually no loss due to a slight error in their estimation of the quantity
 nirmansaamagree saadhaarant: itani pusht lagaai jaati he ki daab aadi balon main 33 pratishat vruddhi hone par bhi kisi prakaar kii haani kii ashanka na rahe
 a good estimate of sinking of the foundation is made by a proper examination of the soil below

 These facts are placed under the 'safety factor', which is assumed to be 2 to 1 / 2 for steel and 3 to 4 for concrete, timber and other equipment
 surakshagunak ko bhawan par atirikt bhaar ladane kaa bahaanaa nahin bananaa chahie
 This is only for unknown reasons and even to a lesser extent, which can prove to be helpful in the future to bear the brunt of the building, disrepair and weather uncertainties
