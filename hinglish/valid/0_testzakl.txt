 With a long pod going backwards, Boeing blends the two

 The concept of front door nose and elevated cockpit was used in the 747's design

 In the role of the freighter, there was a clear need to support containerized transportation methods, which were being widely introduced around the same time
 maanak container saamne kii ore 8 feet varg hote hai tathaa 20 or 40 feet lambaaiyon main uplabdh hai
 This meant that similar to the earlier CX-HLS project, two or three rows of 2-wide 2-high container racks as deep as the aircraft's fuselage were possible

 General Electric pioneered the concept, but remained committed to developing engines for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later
 Pratt and Whitney were also working on the same principle; in late 1966, Boeing, pan-am and Pratt and Whitney agreed to develop a new engine named JT9D for the 747

 The payload, range and passenger capacity of the 747 trijet would have been higher
 The central engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct similar to the L-1011
 However, engineering studies showed that it would have been necessary to completely redesign the 747 wing
 Maintaining the same operational characteristics of the 747 would have been important to minimize the retraining of pilots
 Instead Boeing decided to buy a small four-engine 747, which resulted in the 747SP
 In the 1990s, the Boeing 777, a long-range twinjet aircraft smaller than the 747-400, entered service where the 747-300 was targeted

2 million pounds
 The third study concept, the 747-700X, combined the wing of the 747-600X with a wider fuselage to carry 650 passengers to the same range as the 747-400
 Changes from previous 747 models, especially for the 747-500x and -600X, the new wing was estimated to cost more than $ 5 billion

 aage chalakar vinoba ko gandhi ji kaa aadhyatmik uttaradhikari mana gaya
 Even today some people say this
 magar yah vinoba ke charitra kaa ekangi or ekatarfa vishleshan he
 He was a master of independent thinking, far ahead of Gandhi's 'spiritual successor'
 mukhya baat yah he ki gandhi ji ke prakhar prabhamandal ke aage unke vyaktitv kaa swatantra moolyankan ho hi nahin paaya
 Mahatma Gandhi was a political animal
 unki aadhyatmik chetana subah-shaam kii aarti or puja-paath tak simit thi
 Whereas his religious-consciousness was favorable and coordinative of his political programs
 usamen aalochana-samiksha bhav ke liye koi sthaan nahin tha
 In the matter of religion, even Vinoba had dedication and acceptance
 magar unhen jab bhi avasar mila dharm-granthon kii vyakhya unhone li se hatakar kii
 Whether it is 'gita discourse' or 'santprasad', a book written on the abuses of Sant Tukaram This gives it enough originality and ease
 yah kaary vahi kar saktaa tha jo kisi ke bhi bauddhik prabhamandal se mukt ho
 One thing is that even before Mahatma Gandhi entered into peace, Vinoba had attained spiritual height
 ashram main aanane ke baad bhi ve adhyayan-chintan ke liye niyamit samay nikaalte the
 On being impressed in his first meeting with Vinoba, Gandhi ji had said instinctively- darshanashastra unka priy vishay tha
 Within a few months of admission to the ashram, he took a year of study leave for further study of philosophy
 vinoba ke yun to do chote bhai or bhi the, magar maa kaa sarvaadhik vatsalya vinayak ko hi mila
 On an emotional level, Vinoba also found himself closer to his mother than his father
 yahi haal rukmini bai kaa tha, teenon beton main ‘vinya’ unke dil ke sarvaadhik kareeb tha
 She remained devoted to bhajan-pujan
 Effect of mother's rites
 The feeling of indifference and renunciation towards material comforts had become a part of Vinoba's character in his teens
 ghar kaa nirjan konaa unhen zyada sukun detaa
 maun unke antarman ko mukhar bana detaa
 ve ghar main rahete, parivaar main sabake bich, magar aise ki sabake saath rahete hue bhi jaise unase alag, nisprih or nirpeksh hon
 nahin to maa ke paas, unke sanndhyi main
 ‘vinya’ unke dil, unki aadhyatmik man-rachana ke adhik kareeb tha
 If there is any confusion in the mind, then it helps in solving
 Even if there is a spiritual problem, the Vinaya only works
 Even if husband Narhari Bhave also says something, the decision of Vinaya was important in that
 aisa nahin he ki vinya ekadam mukt yaa niyantran se pare tha
 The family code of conduct was also fully applicable to Vinoba
 balki vinoba ke bachapan kii ek ghatana he
 Rukmini Bai had made a rule for children that food will be available only after giving water to basil plant
 Vinya reaches home after playing outside, distraught with hunger
 On reaching mother, she would say: rukmini sone se pehle samarth guru ramdaas kii pustak ‘das bodh’ kaa pratidin adhyayan karatin
 uske baad hi ve charpai par jaatin
 balak vinya par is asar padana swaabhaavik hi tha
 They would tell him stories of saints Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Namdev and Shankaracharya
 The stories of Ramayana, Mahabharata, explain the element knowledge of Upanishads
 Sannyas used to ride on his feelings
 But instead of running away from the world, she insisted on connecting with people
 Instead of running away from the world, she would ask for change
 Often she says, 'vinya, following the house of labor well, the fathers get freedom
 ’ lekin vinya par to guru ramdaas, sant gyaneshwar or shankaracharya kaa bhoot savaar rahata
 in sabhi mahatmaon ne apni aadhyatmik tripti ke liye bahut kam aayu main apane mata-pita or ghar-parivaar kaa bahishkaar kiya tha
 They say- aise main koi or maa hoti to hill jaati
 vichaarmaatr se ro-rokar aasmaan sir par uthaa leti
 kyonki logon kii saamaanya-si pravriti ban chuki he ki tyaagi, vairaagi hona acchhee baat, mahanata kii baat, magar tabhi tak jab tyaagi or vairaagi duusare ke ghar main hon
 apane ghar main sab saadhaaran sansaarik jivan jeena chaahate hai
 But Rukmini Bai was like any other clay
 ve bade pyaar se bete ko samajhaatin— The son was trying to assimilate the mother's words that she would add further bachapan main bahut kushagra buddhi the vinoba
 ganit unka priy vishay tha
 The rites of poetry and spiritual consciousness met the mother
 unheen se jad or chetan donon ko samaan drushti se dekhne kaa bodh jaagaa
 maa bahut kam padhi-likhi thim
 But he told Vinya about his conduct about Aparigraha, Astaya
 sansar main rahete hue bhi usase nisprih-nirlypt rahanaa sikhaaya
 maa kaa hi asar tha ki vinya kavita rachate or or unhen aag ke hawaale kar dete
 duniya main jab sab kuch asthai or kshanbhangur he, kuch bhi saath nahin janaa to apni rachana se hi moh kyon paala jaae
 unki maa yah sab dekhti, sochatin, magar kuch na kahatee
 maano vinya ko bade se bade tyaag ke liye taiyaar kar rahi hon
 vinoba kii ganit kii praveenta or uske tark unke aadhyatmik vishwaas ke aade nahin aate the
 Even if there was competition between the two, the victory would be of spiritual faith
 Today those events are a historical document of mutual affection and affection of mother and son
 rukmini bai har maheene chaaval ke ek lakh dane daan karti thim
 It was not easy to count one lakh, so she would keep counting every single rice for the whole month
 Narahari Bhave smiled to see his wife laboring in counting rice
 At an early age, the eye would become afraid of weakness
 His math intelligence would have said something else
 So one day he interrupted Rukmini Bai - 'what is the need to spend time counting each and every rice like this? ek pav chaaval lo
 unki ginati kar lo
 phir usee se ek lakh chawlon kaa vajan nikaalkar taul lo
 kami na rahe, isliye ekaadh mutthi upar se daal lo
’ baat tark kii thi
 Cosmic prudence was also in it that whenever possible, time should be saved for other important tasks
 Rukmini Bai would have understood the logic of her husband
 But the mind does not agree One day after he revealed his dilemma to Vinya, he asked- bete ne sabakuch suna, sochaa
 Said, 'mother, father has reason to argue
 ganit yahi kahata he
 But counting rice for charity is not just counting
 ginati karte samay har chaaval ke saath ham na keval ishwar kaa naam lete jate hai, balki hamaara man bhi usee se judaa rahata he
 'counting rice for charity in the name of God is also a practice, where did Rukmini Bai first think
 aadhyatmaras main puri tarah dubi rahane vaali rukmini bai ko ‘vinya’ kii baaten khub bhaatin
 bete par garv ho aata tha unhen
 unhone aage bhi chawlon kii ginati karnaa na choda
 na hi is kaam se unke man kabhi nirarthakta bodh jaagaa
 This is another incident
 jo darshaati he ki vinoba kori ganitiya gananaaon main aadhyatmik tatv kaise khoj lete the
 The incident is about the time when he entered Gandhiji's ashram and was actively participating in his creative works
 ashram main subah-shaam prarthana sabhaayen hotin
 unamem upasthit hone vaale ashramavaasiyon kii niyamit ginati kii jaati
 yah jimmedaari ek kaaryakarta thi
 The incident is that one day after the prayer meeting, when that worker told the number of visitors who were present in the prayer, Vinoba quickly reacted saying - kaaryakarta ko apni ginati par vishwaas tha, isliye vah bhi apni baat par ad gaya
 Vinoba, who believed in karma, generally avoided getting into arguments
 magar us din ve bhi apni baat par ad gaye
 Disputes in the ashram were settled in Bapu's court
 gandhi ji ko apane kaaryakarta par vishwaas tha
 But knew that Vinoba was not going to get into arguments like this
 He looked at Vinoba to know the reality
 Then Vinoba said - 'the number of devotees involved in the prayer was less than what they told
 ’ ‘vah kaise?’ ‘isliye ki ek aadmi kaa to puraa dhyaan vahaan upasthit sajjanon kii ginati karne main laga tha
 Gandhiji understood Vinoba's logic
 prarthana ke kaam main hisaab-kitaab or dikhaave kii jarurat hi kya
 aage se prarthana sabha main aae logon kii ginati kaa kaam roak diya gaya
 Vinoba Aanjan was determined to remain celibate in the early stages of puberty
 vahi mahapurush unke adarsh the jinhone satya kii khoj ke liye bachapan main hi vairaygy odh liya tha
 And when you have to become celibate by taking renunciation, if you want to break away from home life, why not prepare your mind accordingly
 Why be entangled in the sweet cords of relationships, worldly temptations
 The first condition of celibacy is to prevent the mind from wandering
 Control over lusts
 kishor vinayak se kisi ne kah diya tha ki brahmacharee ko kisi vivaah ke bhoj main sammilit nahin hona chahie
 He often avoided going to such programs
 pita narhari bhaave to the hi, yadi kisi or ko hi janaa hua to chote bhai chale jate
 vinoba kaa tan durbal tha
 There was some disease since childhood
 But mind-mind is fully conscious
 It is as if all the powers of the body were confined into the mind
 The memory was unique
 kishor vinayak ne veda, upanishad ke saath-saath sant gyaneshwar, tukaraam, namdev ke saikadon pad acchhee tarah yaad kar liye the
 Geeta had memorized him since childhood
 aage chalakar chalis hajaar shloke bhi unke maanas main acchhee tarah ram gaye
 When Vinayak's elder sister's marriage was fixed, it was as if the hour of examination also came closer
 unhone tay kar liya ki vivaah ke avasar par bhoj se dur rahenge
 koi tokaa-taaki na kare, isliye unhone us din upwas rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 In the sister's marriage, the brother fasted, this was also not appropriate
 pita to sunate hi naaraaz ho gaye
 But the mother handled the matter
 unhone bete ko saadhaaran ‘daal-bhaat’ khaane ke liye raji kar liya
 Not only this, he cooked it with his own hands and gave it too
 dhooma-dham se vivaah hua
 Vinayak happily participated in it
 lekin apane liye maa dwaara khaas taur par banaae daal-bhaat se hi guzaara kiya
 This love of mother and son continued even further
 aage chalakar jab sanyas ke liye ghar choda to maa kii ek laal kinari vaali dhoti or unke puujaghar se ek muti saath le gaye
 He had presented the idol to another
 magar maa kii dhoti jahaan bhi ve jate, apane saath rakhte
 sote to sirahaane rakhkar
 jaise maa kaa aashirwad saath liye phirte hon
 sanyasi man bhi maa kii smritiyon se peechha nahin chhuta paaya tha
 The rites of mother became the foundation of Vinoba's spiritual consciousness
 unheen par unka jeevandarshan viksit hua
 Later on, the fame he earned in the field of creativity and spirituality was also the inspiration of his mother
 rukmini bai kam padhi-likhin thim
 Did not understand Sanskrit
 lekin man tha ki gita-gyaan ke liye tarasata rahata
 ek din maa ne apni kathinaayee putr ke samaksh rakh hi di— Vinoba was opposed to hypocrisy in religious rites
 maa ke nidhan ke samay bhi vinoba kaa apane pita or bhaaiyon se matbhed hua
 Vinoba was opposed to cremation in the traditional manner with the hands of the Brahmins
 lekin parivaar waalon kii jid ke aage unki ek na chali
 vinoba bhi apane siddhanton par adig the
 As a result, the mother whom he wanted most, who was his spiritual master, stayed away from his funeral
 maa ko unhone bhigi ankhon se maun vidaai di
 Later on 29 October 1947, when Vinoba's father died, he insisted on pressing the soil, instead of dedicating his body to fire, following the instructions of the Vedas that 'the soil has the right to the soil'
 tab tak vinoba sant vinoba ho chuke the
 He was blessed by Gandhiji
 isliye is baar unheen kii chali
 Mother had faith in Gita
 ve vinoba ko gita kaa marathi main anuwaad karne kaa daayitv saunpkar gai thim
 Vinoba was busy in that task
 aakhir anuwaad karm puraa hua
 The book was named - Geetai
 Geeta + i = Geetai
 In Maharashtra, 'I' means 'towards mother'; That is, the memory of the mother is associated with her nehru-gita
 Rukmini Bai was not alive to see the son's work
 magar unki yaad or abhilaashaa se judi gitai, maharashtra ke ghar-ghar main maataaon or bahanon ke kanth-swar main dhalane lagi
 His spirituality became the jewel of consciousness
 gandhi ji ne suna to anuwaad karm kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii
 For women who did not know Sanskrit, who had even half-incomplete knowledge of their language, 'geetai', composed in simple language, became a boon to drown in the spirituality of the Gita
 vinoba ko bachapan main maa se mili sanskaar yuvavastha main or bhi gadhe hote chale gaye
 Moving towards youth, Vinoba had neither forgotten Saint Dnyaneshwar nor Tukaram
 vahi unke adarsh the
 He used to sing with great enthusiasm in Saint Tukaram
 He liked to fight, quarrel with his adorable, abusive and angry, he liked very much
 The life of Saint Ramdas also inspired him
 He was neither able to forget Shankaracharya nor his retirement
 darshan unka priy vishay tha
 Ever since the Himalayas were conscious, they used to come in their dreams and they would have imagined themselves meditating in deep tendons in search of truth
 The uninhabited there, in the long, deep cauldrons covered with worms, used to incite them to become absorbed in the pursuit of supreme truth
 1915 main unhone hai skool kii pariksha paas kii
 Now what to read next The ideological duality of the father of scientific temper and mother steeped in spirituality also appeared in different streams there
 pita ne kahaμ‘french padho
’ maa boleen—‘brahman kaa betaa sanskrit na padhe, yah kaise sambhav he!’ vinoba ne un donon kaa man rakhaa
 Chose French at Inter
 sanskrit kaa adhyayan unhone nijee str par jari rakhaa
 In those days, French was the language of revolution in the field of knowledge science
 sara parivartankami sahitya usamen rachaa ja rahaa tha
 Baroda's library, on the other hand, was famous throughout the country for treasures of rare books, manuscripts
 vinoba ne us pustkaalay ko apana doosraa thikaana bana diya
 As soon as he was discharged from school, he would go to the library and drown in studies
 French literature introduced Vinoba to the ideological revolution happening in western countries
 Knowledge of Sanskrit enabled him to penetrate deeply into the Vedas and Upanishads
 gyaan kaa str badha, to uski lalak bhi badi
 magar man se himalay kaa aakarshan, sanyas kii saadh, vairagyabodh na gaya
 In those days, had to go to Mumbai for the Inter examination
 vinoba bhi tay kaarykram ke anusaar 25 march 1916 ko mumbai jane vaali railgadee main savaar hue
 us samay unka man dawandol tha
 i was confident that i would pass the Inter exam just like high school
 But what after that? Is this the goal of his life? Vinoba felt that what he wanted in his life was not possible through formal study
 vidhyalay ke praaanpatr or kaliz kii digriyaan unka abhishth nahin hai
 The train was running at its own pace
 usase sahasr guna tej bhaag rahaa tha vinoba kaa man
 aakhir jeet man kii hui
 As soon as the car reached Surat, Vinoba came down from it
 gaadi aage badi par vinoba kaa man duusari ore khinchataa chalaa gaya
 On the second platform, there was an eastbound train
 vinoba ko laga ki himalay ek baar phir unhen aamantrit kar rahaa he
 Household life or retirement
 There was a struggle in the mind for some time
 He made the decision while going through the turbulence and boarded the same car
 sanyasi apni pasandida yatra par nikal padaa
 is hakeekat se anjaan ki is baar bhi jis yatra ke liye ve thaan kar nikle hai, vah unki asli yatra nahin, sirf ek padaav he
 Escape from life is not their destiny
 unhen to lakhon-karodon bharatiyon ke jivan kii saadh, unke liye ek ummid banakar ubharna he
 Vinoba was wandering in search of Brahm, the search for truth, the practice of renunciation
 usee lakshya ke saath unhone ghar choda tha
 The journey towards the Himalayas was on
 bich main kaashi kaa padaav aayaa
 According to myths, the city of Lord Shankar
 Kashi has been the center of religious philosophy for thousands of years
 Aquarius of sages and thinkers
 a holy pilgrimage center attracting curious and knowledge-oriented people
 Even Shankaracharya could not stop himself from the temptation of traveling to Kashi
 kaashi ke ganga ghat par jahaan nae vichaar panape to vitanda bhi anginat rache jate rahe
 Vinoba was wandering on the same Ganges coast
 apane liye manzil kii talash main
 guru kii talash main jo unhen aage kaa rasta dikhaa sake
 The path to reach the goal for which he had left home
 bhatakate hue ve ek sthaan par pahunche jahaan kuch satya-sadhak shastrarth kar rahe the
 The subject was who was right in advaita and dvaita
 The question was quite old
 lagbhag baarah sau varsh pehle bhi is par nirnaayak bahes ho chuki thi
 Between Shankaracharya and Mandan Mishra
 In that historical debate, the dualist Mandan Mishra and his wife were defeated by Shankaracharya
 vahi vishay phir un satya-saadhakon ke bich aa fansaa tha
 Or say that the two sides were creating their own arguments with their arguments to cut the time
 or phir bahes ko samaapan kii ore le jate hue achaanak ghoshnaa kar di gai ki advaitavaadi kii jeet hui he
 Vinoba Chanke
 He lost his laugh- ek ore vinoba sanyas kii saadh main, satyanveshan kii lalak liye kaashi kii galiyon main, ghaaton par bhatak rahe the
 On the other hand, another curious was set out to visit India, to know India, to recognize the beats of his heartland, to establish an intimate relationship with him
 vah kuch hi maheene pehle dakshin africa se beshumaar khyaati batorkar lautaa tha
 Further, it was planned to interfere in Indian politics
 us sadhak kaa naam tha—mohandas karamchand gandhi
 apane raajnneetik guru govind ballab pant ke kehane par vah bharat kii aatma ko jaanane ke uddeshy se ek varsh ke bharat-bhraman par niklaa hua tha
 Gandhi, who later became the non-violent fighter, became the main architect of the Indian independence movement, the heartbeat of crores of Indians, dominated the Indian politics in those days
 ‘mahatma’ kii oopaadhi bhi unase dur thi
 Only the capital of the agitation launched in South Africa was with him
 usee ke kaaran ve puure bharat main jane jate the
 In those days his stop was also Kashi
 maano do mahaan atmaaon ko milwane ke liye samay apana jaadui khel rach rahaa tha
 In Kashi, a huge procession was taking place in the Hindu University established by Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya
 4 farvari 1916, jalse main raaje-maharaaje, nabaav, samant sab apni puri dhaj ke saath upasthit the
 It was made on seeing the tone of the conference
 us sammelan main gandhi ji ne aitihaasik bhaashan diya
 He said what no one could expect at that time
 vakt padane par jin raja-saamanton kii khushaamad swayan angrej bhi karte the, jinke daan par kaashi vishvavidhyalay or duusari anya sansthaaen chalaa karti thim, un raja-saamanton kii khuli aalochana karte hue gandhi ji ne kaha ki apane dhan kaa sadupyog rashtranirmaan ke liye karen
 Apply it for the welfare of the poor
 He asked them to donate all their jewelery to the wider public interest
 vah ek krantikari apil thi
 There was a panic in the meeting
 par gandhi kii muskaan usee tarah bani rahi
 The next day the newspapers were dyed with the news of that conference
 vinoba ne samachaarpatr ke madhyam se hi gandhi ji ke bare main janaa
 or unhen laga ki jis lakshya kii khoj main ve ghar se nikle hai, vah puri hui
 Vinoba Corey did not leave home in search of peace
 na ve desh ke halaat or angrejon dwaara kiye ja rahe amanviya atyaacharon se aparichit the
 But there was no way out
 bhaashan padhakar unhen laga ki is vyakti ke paas shanti bhi he or kranti bhi
 unhone vahiin se gandhi ji ke naam patr likhaa
 jawaab aayaa
 With Gandhiji's invitation
 Vinoba was waiting for him
 ve turant ahmedabad sthit cocharb ashram kii ore prasthaan kar gaye, jahaan gandhi ji kaa ashram tha
 On 7 June 1916 Vinoba met Gandhi for the first time
 uske baad to vinoba gandhi ji ke hi hokar rah gaye
 Gandhiji also recognized Vinoba's talent
 isliye pehali mulaakaat ke baad hi unki tippanee thi ki adhikansh log yahaan se kuch lene ke liye aate hai, yah pehla vyakti he, jo kuch dene ke liye aayaa he
 Recalling his first meeting after a long time, Vinoba said- gandhi or vinoba kii vah mulaakaat krantikari thi
 As soon as Gandhiji came to know that Vinoba had come without telling his parents, he wrote a letter to Vinoba's father from there that Vinoba was safe with him
 uske baad unke sambandh lagaataar pragadh hote chale gaye
 Vinoba devoted himself to Gandhiji's ashram
 adhyayan, adhyaapan, katai, kheti ke kaam se lekar saamudayik jivan tak ashram kii har gatividhi main ve aage rahete
 gandhi ji kaa yah kahana ki yah yuvak ashramavaasiyon se kuch lene nahin balki dene aayaa he, satya hota ja rahaa tha
 Vinoba, who was very young from his age, was teaching him a lesson of discipline and dutifulness
 gandhi ji kaa prabhaav teji se bad rahaa tha
 The number of workers coming to the ashram is increasing equally fast
 The Kocharb ashram started getting smaller, and the work of new ashram on the banks of Sabarmati in Ahmedabad started happening fast
 But the work of preparing non-violent soldiers of independence was not possible even from the Sabarmati Ashram alone
 gandhi vaisaa hi ashram wardha main bhi chaahate the
 There was a need for such a disciplined worker who could run the ashram in accordance with Gandhiji's ideals
 For this, Vinoba was the most suitable character and reliable of Gandhiji
 Vinoba departed for Wardha on 8 April 1923
 vahaan unhone ‘maharashtra dharm’ masik kaa sampadan shuru kiya
 In this magazine to be published in Marathi, Vinoba started writing regularly on the Upanishads and the saints of Maharashtra, which led to the beginning of the Bhakti movement in the country
 patrika ko apratyaashit lokapriyata praapt hui, kuch hi samay pashchaat usko saptahik kar dena padaa vinoba abhi tak gandhi ji ke shishy or satyagrahi ke rup main jane jate the
 Through the magazine, the public was getting to know their spiritual penetration
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke samay united kingdom dwaara bharat desh ko jabaran yuddh main jhonka ja rahaa tha jiske viruddh ek vyaktigat satyagrah 17 aktubar, 1940 ko shuru kiya gaya tha or isamen gandhi ji dwaara vinoba ko pratham satyagrahi banaaya gaya tha
 Before starting his Satyagraha, Vinoba issued a statement clarifying his views
 usamen kaha gaya tha- He further said so much - apane bhaashanon main vinoba logon ko bataate the ki nakaaratmak kaaryakramon ke jariye na to shaanti sthapit ho sakati he or na yuddh samaapt ho saktaa he
 War is the result of a morbid mentality and requires creative programs
 keval europe ke logon ko nahin samast maanav jati ko iskaa daayitv uthaanaa chahie
 In September 1951, k
p
mashruwala's book Gandhi and Marx was published and Vinoba wrote the role
 isamen vinoba ne marks ke prati kaaphi sammaan pradarshit kiya tha
 He considered Karl Marx a thinker
 aisa vichaarak jiske man main garibon ke prati sachhee sahanubhuti thi
 By the way, Vinoba was found to be wrong in Marx's thinking and expressed his differences with Marx on how to reach the goal
 vinoba kaa maananaa tha ki dhani logon kii vajah se communiston kaa udbhav hua he
 Vinoba believed that the principle of equality should be applied in everything
 unhone kaha tha : communiston kaa aatank dur karne ke liye police karrwai madadgaar sabit nahin ho sakati
 It should be eliminated from the root
 chaahe jitne bhi digbhramit ve kyon na ho, vinoba communiston ko vidhvansak nahin maanate the or unase tarkvitark karke tathaa unke lakshya ke prati sakriy sahanubhuti prakat karke vinoba unhen sahi raste par laana chaahate the
 Vinoba ji, a scholar of twenty languages, wanted to see Devanagari as a world script
 bharat ke liye ve devanagari ko sampark lipi ke rup main viksit karne ke pakshdhar the
 They used to say that i do not say that Nagari should only go, but i want Nagari also to go
 unke hi vichaaron se prerana lekar nagari lipi sangam kii sthapana kii gayi he jo bharat ke andar or bharat ke baahar devanagari ko upyog or prasar karne ke liye kaary karti he
 For detailed information read Nagari and Indian languages
 vinobaaji sadev saamaajik or rachanaatmak kaaryakarta rahe
 He actively contributed to Gandhian's creative works before independence
 kaarydhiky se unka swasthya girane laga, unhen kisi pahari sthaan par jane kii doctor ne salaah di
 So in 1937, Vinoba Bhave went to the Pawanar Ashram
 tab se lekar jivan paryant unke rachanaatmak kaaryon ko prarambh karne kaa yahi kendriya sthaan rahaa
 He was also a great freedom fighter in addition to creative works
 nagpur jhanda satyagrah main ve bandi banaaye gayi
 In 1937, when Gandhiji surrendered empty handed from the London Round Table Conference, Vinoba Bhave criticized the British at a gathering in Jalgaon, and was sentenced to six months in prison
 karagaar se mukt hone ke baad gandhiji ne unhen pahela satyagrahi banaaya
 Vinoba Bhaveji performed the Satyagraha on 17 October 1940 and he was imprisoned and was punished for 3 years rigorous imprisonment
 gandhiji ne 1942 ko bharat chhoda andolan karne se purv vinobaaji se paraamarsh liya tha
 Nagaland is a north eastern state of India
 isaki rajdhani kohima he, jabaki dimapur rajya kaa sabase bada nagar he
 Nagaland borders Assam in the west, Arunachal Pradesh in the north, Burma in the east and Manipur in the south
 bharat kii 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar, iskaa kshetrafal 16,579 varg kilometre he, or jansankhya 19,80,602 he, jo ise bharat ke sabase chote rajyon main se ek banaati he
 a total of 16 tribes inhabit the state of Nagaland
 prayek janajati apane vishisht reeti-rivaajon, bhashaa or poshaak ke kaaran duusari se bhinn he
 However, language and religion are two bridges that connect these tribes
 angreji rajya kii aadhikarik bhashaa he
 It is also the language of education, and is spoken by most residents
 nagaland bharat ke un teen rajyon main se ek he, jahaan isai dharm ke anuyaayi jansankhya main bahumat main hai
 The state has witnessed revolts as well as inter-ethnic conflicts in the 1950s
 hinsa or asuraksha ne nagaland ke aarthik vikaas ko simit kar diya tha, kyonki ise kanoon, vyavastha or suraksha ke liye apane durlabh sansadhano ko patibaddh karnaa tha
 However, in the last one and a half decades, violence in the state has come down considerably, bringing the state's annual economic growth rate to near 10%, making it the fastest growing state in the Northeast region
 nagaland kii sthapana 1 disambar 1963 ko bharat ke 16wein rajya ke rup me hui thi
 Most of the state is mountainous except for a few areas along the Assam valley
 rajya ke kul kshetrafal kaa keval 9% hissaa samtal jameen par he
 The highest peak in Nagaland is Mount Saramati, which is 3840 m above sea level

 The state is home to a rich diversity of flora and fauna
 is rajya kaa itihaas burma or assam se miltaa-julata he lekin kuch maton ke anusaar is rajya kaa naam angrezon ne naga ke anusaar rakhaa tha
 During the First World War, the British sent many Nagas to France and Europe to fight in the war
 jo log yuddh main ladne baahar gayi or jab ve log bharat waapas aae to unhone naga nashnlist movement kii sthapana kii thi
 Nagaland was under Assam during the independence of India but the Nagas wanted their development
 isi kaaran se ve kisi kendriya sarkaar se judana chaahate the

 In the days of its Tulsi Pocket Books, it used to be a popular Hindi novel publishing company in India and has built up a wide readership of its novel readership, although Tulsi comics was at an ever-higher level due to its inferior stories
 Could not achieve success, as other companies like Diamond Comics, Raj Comics and Manoj Comics set their standards And because of this year closed the company until 2004

 Jambu was very successful in the roles of Tulsi comics, more or less by his creator Ved Prakash Sharma, Angara and Tausi
 tulsi kamiks masik taur par apni kamiks prakashit karti thi
 Before 6 to 10 counting comics were published every month, then Angara, Tausi and Jambu were the three leading heroes of the publication during that time

 immunofloresence ek aisi takanic he jiskaa upyog prakaash sookshmdarshi ke liye pratidipti sookshmdarshi ke saath kiya jaataa he or iskaa upyog pramukh rup se jaivik namoonon par kiya jaataa he
 This technique uses immunity specificity for its antigen to target fluorescent dyes to specific biomolecules targeted within a cell and therefore makes it possible to visualize the target molecule distribution through the sample
 epitop masping main bhi prayaas kiye gaye hai kyonki kai antibody ek hi epitop se jud sakate hai or ek hi epitop pahchaan sakane vaali antibody ke bich judaav ke str alag-alag ho sakate hai
 Additionally, fluorophore joining with antibodies may not interfere with the antibody's immune specificity or ability to bind to its antigen
 immunofloresence, immunostanning kaa vyapak rup se prayog kiya jane vaala ek udhaaharan he or immunohistochemistry kaa ek vishisht udhaaharan he jo pratirakshiyon kii sthiti ko dekhne ke liye florophorus kaa upyog karata he
 Immunofluorescence is used on tissue sections, cultured cell lines, or individual cells and can be used to analyze the distribution of proteins, glycans, and small biological and non-biological molecules
 yadi koshika jhilli kii topology abhi tak nirdhaarit nahin kii gai he, to protein main epitop sammilan kaa upyog sanrachanaon ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye immunofloresence ke sangyojan ke saath kiya ja saktaa he
 Immunofluorescence can also be used as a "semi-quantitative" method to gain insight into DNA methylation levels and localization patterns because it is a more time-consuming method than actual quantitative methods and some in the analysis of methylation levels Is subjectivity
 immunofloresence ko fluoroscent staning ke anya gaiyr pratirakshi ke saath sangyojan karke upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, by using DAPI to label DNA
 Several microscopic designs are used to analyze immunofluorescence samples; The simplest of these is the epifluorescence microscope and the confocal microscope is always widely used
 vibhinn super-rijolution sookshmdarshi dizin jo or adhik ucch parinaam dene main sakasham hai, unka upyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 There are two classes of immunofluorescence techniques, primary and secondary
 praathmik, yaa pratyaksh, immunofloresence ek ekal pratirakshi kaa upyog karata he jo ek florophore ke saath rasinic tareeke se judy hui hoti he
 This antibody recognizes and binds to the target molecule and the fluorophore present in it can be detected through a microscope
 nimnlikhit dwitiyak protocol ke mukaable is takanic ke kai phaayde hai jiskaa kaaran he florophore ke saath pratirakshi kaa pratyaksh sangyojan
 yah staning prakriya ke kai charnon ko kam kar detaa he or isliye yah tej he or yah pratirakshi vipareet pratikaar yaa gaiyr vishistataa ke saath kuch muddon se batch sakate hai, jo prishthbhumi sanket main vruddhi kii aguwai karata he
 Secondary, or indirect, immunofluorescence uses two antibodies, the first that recognizes and binds to the target molecule and the second, which carries the fluorophore, identifies and binds to the primary antibody
 yah protocol, uparokt praathmik se adhik jatil he or isamen adhik samay lagata he lekin yah adhik lacheelaapan pradaan karata he
 This protocol is possible because an antibody has two parts, a variable region and an immutable region
 ek shodhakarta kai praathmik pratirakshi utpann kar saktaa he jo vibhinn antigenon kii pahchaan karata he, lekin sabhi ek hi aparivartaneey kshetra ko sanjha karte hai
 Therefore all these antibodies are identified by a single secondary antibody
 yah praathmik pratirakshi ko pratyaksh rup se ek florophore vahan karne ke liye sanshodhit karne kii laagat ko bachaata he
 Different primary antibodies with invertebrate regions are usually generated by growing the antibody in different species
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek shodhakarta ek bakrii main praathmik pratirakshi paidaa kar saktaa he jo kai antigenon kii pahchaan karata he or tab daai-yugmit khargosh kii dwitiyak pratirakshi ko shaamil karata he jo bakrii kii pratirakshi aparivartaneey kshetra kii pahchaan karata he 
 The researchers then prepare a second set of primary antibodies in a rat that can be identified by a different "donkey non-rat" secondary antibody
 yah banane-main-mushkil daai-yugmit pratirakshiyon ke kai pareekshanon main punah upyog ko sambhav banaata hai
 As is the case with most fluorescence techniques, an important problem with immunofluorescence is photobleaching
 prakaash anaavaran kii tivrata yaa samay kaal ko kam karke, floroforess ke ghanatv ko badhaane ke dwaara, yaa bleaching ke prati kam samvedansheel adhik thos floroforess ke prayog dwaara ke dwaara photobleaching kii vajah se hue gatividhiyon ke nuksaan ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 In general, immunofluorescence is limited to a fixed sample
 immunofloresence ke dwaara jivit koshikaon ke bheetar kii sanrachana ke vishleshan sambhav nahin he, chunki pratirakshi koshika jhilli ko paar nahin kar sakate
 vaise immunofloresence ke kuch upyogon ko, fluoroscent protein domen yukt punah sanyojak protein ke vikaas dwaara aprachlit kar diya gaya, udhaaharan ke taur par haraa pratidipti protein 
 The use of such "tagged" proteins makes it possible to determine their localization in living cells

 is sanshodhan kii ro se pakistan sansadeey shashan aanshik raashtrapati shashan main badal gaya or raashtrapati pakistan kai atirikt vikalp or sanvaidhanik shakti milti aa gai
 There is an option that Article 58 of Sub Part 2 of the Constitution of Pakistan is included giving the President of Pakistan the right to dissolve the National Assembly of Pakistan, whereas the Senate had no right to dissolve
 is sanshodhan ke tahat agar pakistan ke raashtrapati kii raay main desh main aisi sthiti upji he jiske tahat sarkaar or rajya vyavastha samvidhan pakistan ke tahat na chalaae ja sakate hai or nae chunaavon kaa aayojan aprihaary ho to vah pakistan kii neshnal assembly ko bhang sakate hai
 Due to this amendment made in Article 58 of the Constitution of Pakistan, the President of Pakistan could also terminate the Prime Minister and his cabinet
 aathven sanshodhan, jiske tahat samvidhan main duusari kai sanshodhan bhi kiye gaye hi chaynit baat yah thi ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 58 main die aabhal binduon kaa bhi badi, '2
 'if there are occasions other than the conditions mentioned in Component 2 in Article 49 of the Constitution, then the President can dissolve the National Assembly of Pakistan, eg,' A
 ' 'pradhanmantri ke khilaaf sadan main avishvaas prastaav safal hone or sadan kaa koi doosraa sadsy is sthiti main na ho ki vah samvidhan pakistan ke tahat sadan kaa vishwaas le sake, yaa 'kha
 'some circumstances arise in the country when it is not possible to run the government and state system and affairs under the Constitution Pakistan and if the solution is not even with the Election College of Pakistan, then the President of Pakistan can dissolve the assembly in his opinion
 samvidhan pakistan ke anuchhed pu 2 bi jiske tahat pakistan ke raashtrapati ko vidhansabha bhang karne kaa adhikaar tha, iskaa istemaal 1990 ke dashak main teen baar kiya gaya
 The first opportunity to use this option was President Ghulam Isaac Khan against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government on 6 August 1990, on another occasion, President Ghulam Isaac Khan against Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif's government in 1993 and the third time against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government

 Wherever this article was used, the President of Pakistan made a clear statement of the reasons for its use and the corruption of most government administration was used as a weapon
 is aarope ke baad sarkari sansthaaon janata main apni pratishtha or lokapriyata kho baithe
 This was the reason that every time the ruling party had to face defeat in the elections and the numerical superiority in the Parliament did not come on the part of any party
 1997 main samvidhan pakistan main terahaven sanshodhan jisaki ro raashtrapati pakistan se vah vikalp waapas le liye gaye jisase vah vidhansabha ko bhang kar sakate the aise raashtrapati shivi jaahir rabar stump banakar rah gaya
 In democracy implemented in Pakistan, there is no need that the mps of the public can be held accountable after the election is made
 sansthagat javabdehi pehle hi naganya tha ki samvidhan main kiye gaye terahaven or chaudaaven sanshodhan ke kri sarkari javabdehi sari raahen bhi avaruddh kar di gayi
 Prime Minister Pakistan was made so strong that the government was not possible during any time during the prime minister or his administration and cabinet accountable

 The Go President got the right to dissolve the Pakistan National Assembly but the President's move was subjected to the confirmation of the Supreme Court of Pakistan
 aamtaur aathven sanshodhan uske anuchhed pu do bi ke tahat hi yaad kiya jaataa he, jo ro se raashtrapati ko vidhansabha bhang karne kaa vikalp praapt hue
 However, the Eighth Amendment was actually an agreement or deal between the parliament selected on non-party basis and the then President General Zia ul Haq
 1985 ke chunaav se pehle lagbhag chah saal tak general jiya samvidhan pakistan main kai sanshodhan kar chuke the jo ki sanvaidhanik sanshodhan aadesh ke kri kiye gaye the, unamem sabase prasiddh samvidhan pakistan 1973 tha
 Under this presidential order, the right to dissolve the presidential assemblies was actually obtained
 is bare jo aspashtataa paaya jaataa he ki chaynit vidhansabha ne aisi vivaadaaspad sanshodhan ko paarit kaise kiya? is bare jaananaa jaruri he ki vastav main is samay raashtrapati jiya ne chah varshon main raashtrapati karyaalay ko jitne bhi vikalp raashtrapati aadesh naamon ke kri paarit kiye the unamem se zyaadaatar ke badale hi sadan se yah sanshodhan paarit karavaaya tha
 Constitutional experts in this regard actually view the Eighth Amendment as a reconciliation deal
