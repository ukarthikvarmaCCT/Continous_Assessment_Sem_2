 This gathering, which is one of the best sacred conferences ever held, automatically renders this wonderful sermon of the Gita and announces it to the world: arthath jo koi meri ore aata he-chaahe kisi prakaar se ho-main usko praapt hota hoon
 People try on different paths and finally come towards me
 sampradayikta, hathdharmita or unki vibhats vanshdhar dharmandhata is sundar prithvi par bahut samay tak rajya kar chuki hai
 They have been filling the earth with violence and bathing it repeatedly with the blood of humanity, demolishing civilizations and putting entire countries in despair
 yadi ye vibhats daanvi shaktiyaan na hotin to maanav samaaj aaj kii avasthaa se kahin adhik unnat ho gaya hota
 But now their time has come, and i hope internally that the loud sound that has been made in honor of this gathering this morning is of all the indignity, of all the atrocities caused by sword or pen and moving towards the same goal
 The death of mutual bitterness of human beings should be proved to be innocent

 parantu ek american professor ke prayaas se unhen thodaa samay mila
 All the scholars were surprised to hear his views in that council
 phir to america main unka atyadhik swaagat hua
 There became a large community of his devotees
 teen varsh ve america main rahe or vahaan ke logon ko bhartiya tatvagyan kii adbhut jyoti pradaan kii
 Given his oratory style and knowledge of the media there Saiclonik Hindu named him
 "aadhyatm-vidya or bhartiya darshan ke bina vishwa anaath ho jaayegaa" yah swami vivekananda kaa drudh vishwaas tha
 In the US, he established several branches of the Ramakrishna Mission
 anek amareeki vidwaanon ne unka shishyatv grahan kiya
 They always address themselves as servants of poor
 bharat ke gaurav ko desh-deshaantaron main ujjwal karne kaa unhone sadaa praytn kiya
 The work that Swami Vivekananda did in the brief lifetime of thirty nine years will continue to guide the generations for many centuries to come
 tees varsh kii aayu main swami vivekananda ne chicago, america ke vishwa dharm sammelan main hindu dharm kaa pratinidhitiv kiya or use saarvbhaumik pahchaan dilvaayi
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur once said- "if you want to know India, read Vivekananda
 unamem aap sab kuch sakaaratmak hi paayenge, nakaaratmak kuch bhi nahin
 " romaa rolland ne unke bare main kaha tha-"unke dwitiya hone kii kalpana karnaa bhi asambhav he, ve jahaan bhi gayi, sarvapratham hi rahe

 " unnisvin sadi ke aakhri varshon main vivekananda lagbhag sashastr yaa hinsak kranti ke jariye bhi desh ko aaazaad karnaa chaahate the
 But he soon became convinced that the circumstances were not yet ripe for those intentions
 iske baad hi vivekananda ne ‘ekala chalo‘ kii niti kaa paalan karte hue ek parivrajak ke rup main bharat or duniya ko khangaal daalaa
 He said that i want many young ascetics who can spread to the villages of India and spend their time in the service of countrymen
 unka yah sapana puraa nahin hua
 Vivekananda was strongly opposed to priesthood, religious fanaticism, dogma and orthodoxy
 unhone dharm ko manushya kii seva ke kendra main rakhkar hi aadhyatmik chintan kiya tha
 Their Hindu religion was not strange, ludicrous and pneumatic
 unhone yah vidrohi bayaan diya tha ki is desh ke taintis karod bhukhe, daridr or kuposhan ke shikaar logon ko devi devataaon kii tarah mandiron main sthapit kar diya jaye or mandiron se devi devataaon kii murtiyon ko hataa diya jaye
 This classic call of theirs raises a big question mark at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century
 unke is aahvaan ko sunakar puure purohit varg kii ghigghi bandh gai thi
 Today, if any other sage, can the government machinery also not afford to remove the idol of any illegal temple
 vivekananda ke jivan kii antarlay yahi thi ki ve is baat se aashwast the ki dharti kii god main yadi aisa koi desh he jisane manushya kii har tarah kii behatari ke liye eemaandaar koshishen kii hai, to vah bharat hi he
 He also ridiculed priesthood, Brahminism, religious rituals and stereotypes and waged a war against such inconsistencies in almost invasive language
 unki drushti main hindu dharm ke sarvshereshth chintakon ke vichaaron kaa nichod puri duniya ke liye ab bhi irshyaa kaa vishay he
 Swamiji had indicated that there is material prosperity abroad and that India needs it too, but we should not be a petitioner
 hamaare paas usase zyada bahut kuch he jo ham pashchim ko de sakate hai or pashchim ko uski besakhta jarurat he
 This was not a boast or boast of Swami Vivekananda for the heritage of his country
 yah ek vedanti sadhu kii bhartiya sabhyataa or samskruti kii tatasth, vastuparak or moolyagat aalochana thi
 The history of the twentieth century later stamped the same

 He wanted an education that could lead to all-round development of the child
 balak kii shiksha kaa uddeshy usko aatmanirbhar banaakar apane pairon par khadaa karnaa he
 Swami Vivekananda has termed the prevailing education as 'prohibitive education' and said that you consider a person who has passed some examinations and who can give good speeches, but the reality is that education is a struggle for the masses
 For those who do not build character, who do not develop the spirit of social service and who cannot cultivate courage like a lion, such a shi What are the benefits of Rsha? atah swamiji saiddhanthik shiksha ke paksh main nahin the, ve vyaavhaarik shiksha ko vyakti ke liye upyogi maanate the
 The education of a person prepares him for the future, so it is necessary to have those elements in education, which are important for his future
 swami vivekananda ke shabdon main, Swami Ji wants to prepare for both secular and otherworldly life through education
 loukik drushti se shiksha ke sambandh main unhone kaha he ki 'hamen aisi shiksha chahie, jisase charitra kaa gathan ho, man kaa bal bade, buddhi kaa vikaas ho or vyakti swazlambi bane
 He has said 'from a worldly point of view that' education is an expression of the inherent perfection of man
 ' Following are the basic principles of Swami Vivekananda's education philosophy - 1
 shiksha aisi ho jisase balak kaa shaareerik, maansik evam atmik vikaas ho sake
 2
 Education should be in such a way that the child's character is built, the mind is developed, the intellect is developed and the child becomes self-reliant
 3
 balak evam balikaon donon ko samaan shiksha deni chahie
 4
 Religious education should be imparted through conduct and rituals rather than books
 5
 paathyakram main loukik evam parloukik donon prakaar ke vishyon ko sthaan dena chahie
 6
 Education can be obtained in Guru Griha
 7
 shikshak evam chaatr kaa sambandh adhik se adhik nikat kaa hona chahie
 8
 Publicity and propagation of education should be known to the general public
 9

 Human and national education should start from the family

 Cross-matching of the antagonistic rhd antigen is essential, as the rhd antigen is mmunogenic, ie Individuals who are rhd negative are likely to develop anti-rhd when they encounter a rhd antigen, when a person is sensitized against the rhd antigen, has a rhd igg antigen in their blood Gay will bind to rhd positive rbcs and may cross the placenta ab 29 maanav rakt samooh pranaaliyon ko antarrashtriya raktaadhan sampradaay ke dwaara manyata praapt hanek purna rakt prakaar laal rakt koshikaon kii sataha ke puure 29 padaarthon ke jatthe kaa varnan karegaa or ek vyakti kaa rakt prakaar rakt samooh pratijanon ke kai sambhav sanyojanon main se ek he29 rakt samoohon main, 600 se adhik vibhinn rakt samooh pratijan paye gaye hai,lekin in main se kai bahut virale hai yaa phir mukhya rup se kuch jaateey samoohon main paye jate hai Almost always, a person has the same blood group for life, but very rarely a person's blood type is caused by an increase or suppression of antigen, a person's blood type infection, malignancy or autoimmune disease

 rhd negative women or patients with rhd antagonists should not be plated, so the blood cells must conserve Rhesus negative blood in extreme situations such as severe bleeding when there are low rhd negative blood units in the blood corpuscles
 rhd positive blood can be given to women above childbearing age and rhd negative men to protect rhd antibodies, If they do not have anti-rhd antibodies
 The opposite is not true: rhd negative blood does not react to rhd positive patients

 Although special potent anti-a, anti-b or other abnormal blood groups are out of repulsive blood donation, the terms ubiquitous donor and ubiquitous type Patients are simplifications because they are only focusing on the possible responses of the recipient's anti-a and anti-b antibodies to the red blood cells that are transfused and possible sensitization of the rhd antigens to the anti-a and Potential response among anti-b antibodies was not taken into account because only a small fraction of the antimicrobial plasma infusions Has been done udaahranvash: yah sochate hue kii rakt samooh a rd sakaaratmak praptakarta main rhd nakaaratmak rakt kaa aadhaan, praptakarta ke anti-b rog pratikaarak or aadhanit laal rakt koshikaon main pratiraksha pratikriya kii ummid nahin he halanki chadhaae gaye rakt main plasma main anti-a rog pratikaarak kii apekshaakrit choti raashi hoti he jo praptakarta kii laal rakt koshika kii sataha ke a pratijanon ke saath pratikriya kar saktaa he, tanukaran gunak ke kaaran kisi mahatvapurn pratikriya kii ummid nahin he Rhesus d samvedikaran pratyaashit nahin he
 In addition to A, b and Rh D, red blood cell surface antigens can cause sensitization and adverse reactions if they are able to stick to analogous antibodies to produce immune responses
 The infusions become further complicated because of platelets and white blood cells
 Surface antigens have their own systems and may be susceptible to platelet or WBC antigens

 Development of the Coombs test in 1945, the advent of transfusion medicine, and the understanding of hemolytic disease
 of the newborn led to discovery of more blood groups, and now 29 human blood group systems are recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion, and across the 29 blood groups, over 600 different blood group antigens have been found, but many of these are very rare or are mainly found in certain ethnic groups
 The blood type was used in forensic science and paternity testing, but genetic fingerprinting which is more reliable has replaced them both

 rahim ko unki ichha ke anusaar dilli main hi unki patni ke makbare ke paas hi dafna diya gaya
 These mausoleums are still present in Delhi
 rahim ne swayan hi apane jeevankaal main iskaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 Humayun chose Bairam Khan for the education of Crown Prince Akbar and appointed Akbar's guardian in the last days of his life, giving responsibility for managing the state
 bairam khan ne kushal niti se akbar ke rajya ko majboot banane main puraa sahyog diya
 For some reason there was a difference of opinion between Bairam Khan and Akbar
 akbar ne bairam khan ke vidroh ko safaltaapurvak dabaa diya or apane ustad kii maan evam laaj rakhte hue use haj par jane kii ichha jataai
 As a result, Bairam Khan left for Haj
 bairam khan haj ke liye jate hue gujarat ke patan main tehre or patan ke prasiddh sahasraling sarovar main nauka-vihaar ke baad tat par baithe the ki bhent karne kii niyat se ek afgaan sardaar mubarak khan aayaa or dhokhe se bairam khan kii hatya kar di
 Mubarak Khan did this to avenge his father's death
 is ghatana ne bairam khan ke parivaar ko anaath bana diya
 Not only did these fraudsters commit murder, but they also caused a lot of looting
 vidhwaa sultanaa begum apane kuch sevakon sahit bachakar ahmedabad aa gai
 As soon as Akbar came to know about the incident, he sent a message to Sultana Begum to return to the court
 raste main sandesh paakar begum akbar ke darbar main aa gai
 At such a time, Akbar, giving proof of his greatness, gave shelter to him with great generosity and said to Rahim, "keep it happy in all ways
" ise yah pataa na chale ki inke pita khan khaanaan kaa saaya sar se uth gaya he
 Baba said to Jambur that this is our son
 ise hamaari drushti ke saamne rakhaa karo
 In this way, Akbar raised Rahim just like a son of religion
 kuch dinon ke pashchaat akbar ne vidhwaa sultanaa begum se vivaah kar liya
 Akbar honored Rahim with the title of "mirza Khan" as per the royal family
 rahim kii shiksha- diksha akbar kii udaar dharm- nirpeksh niti ke anukool hui
 Due to this education, the poetry of Rahim remains a thunderous neck of the Hindus even today
 dinakar ji ke kathananusaar akbar ne apane deen-ilaahi main hindootv ko jo sthaan diya hoga, usase kai guna zyada sthaan rahim ne apni kavitaaon main diya
 It is said about Rahim that he was a Muslim by religion and a pure Indian by culture
 rahim kii shiksha samaapt hone ke pashchaat samraat akbar ne apane pita humayun kii parampara kaa nirvaah karte hue, rahim kaa vivaah bairam khan ke virdohi mirza ajij coca kii bahan mahabaanon se karvaa diya
 In this marriage too, Akbar did the same, which had been doing before that due to the relationship of marriage, mutual tension and old bitterness was ended
 rahim ke vivaah se bairam khan or mirza ke bich chali aa rahi puraani ranjish khatm ho gayi
 Rahim was married at the age of about sixteen
 akbar ke darbar ko pramukh padon main se ek mir arj kaa pad tha
 After getting this post, any person would become rich overnight, because this post was such that by which the public's complaint reached the emperor and the decisions taken by the emperor were also conveyed to the public through this post
 is pad par har do- teen dinon main nae logon ko niyukt kiya jaataa tha
 Emperor Akbar appointed his true and trusted character Amir Rahim as Mustakil Mir Arj to run this post smoothly
 yah nirnay sunakar sara darbar sann rah gaya tha
 Holding this position meant that the person is generally reliable both in public and the emperor
 kaaphi minnaton tathaa aashirwad ke baad akbar ko shaikh saleem chishti ke aashirwad se ek ladkaa praapt ho sakaa, jiskaa naam unhone saleem rakhaa
 Shehzada Salim became indifferent to education due to the high affection of parents and other people
 kai mahaan logon ko saleem kii shiksha ke liye akbar ne lagavaaya
 Sher Ahmed, Mir Kalan and court scholar Abulafzal were among these great people
 sabhi logon kii koshishon ke baavjood shahjada saleem ko padhai main man na laga
 Akbar, as always, chose his final weapon, Rahim Khana Khane, as Salim's atalik
 kaha jaataa he rahim yah gaurav paakar bahut prasann the
 Rahim has composed poetry in both Awadhi and Brajbhasha which is simple, natural and fluent
 unke kavy main shringaar, shant tathaa hasya ras milte hai
 Doha, Soratha, Barwai, Kavitta and Savaiya are his favorite verses
 rahim dohavali, barbai, nayika bhed, madanashtak, raas panchadhyaayi, nagar shobhaa aadi

43% ke saath sanyukt udhyam company ke bahutansh share hai
 The plant has not been functional since 2003, although three successful test runs by the end of 2013 have led to commercial production of electricity
 november 2013 main nitish kumaar ne kaha ki kanti main ek or 500 emdblyoo bijli sanyantr sthapit kiya jayega
 The first unit of 195 MW was commissioned by BHEL in March 2015 at a 2x195 MW plant
 13 june 2016 ko 2 x 195 megawatt kii duusari ikai chaalu kii gai thi
 The current capacity of Muzaffarpur Thermal Power Station is 610 MW
 ek or 500 megawatt vistaar pariyojna bhi yojana banaai gai he
 Kanti Thermal will get rail connectivity for uninterrupted supply of coal

 First started in 1985, the Kanti power plant has an installed capacity of 110 × 2 MW
 1 9 02 2 megawatt kii ek atirikt kshamta taiyaar kii ja rahi he or yah disambar 2014 tak puraa ho jane kii sambhaavna he
 Bihar is the most power-stricken state in India; And on the issue of our current nation upliftment, an excellent and clean 'thermal power station' is a necessity
 kanti taap vidyut sanyantr, 1985 main mujffarpur ke tatkaaleen saansad jorge farnandis ke prayaason se astitv main aayaa
 George's first term in 1978 began as Muzaffarpur MP
 november 2014 main, unke yogadan ko sweekaar karne ke liye kanti plant kaa naam jorge furnandis thermal power plant ke rup main badal diya gaya tha
 On 17 April 2018, the Bihar State Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar approved the handing over of the Kanti Thermal Power Station to NTPC Limited
 15 may 2018 ko, bihar sarkaar ne thermal plant ko 33-varshiya patte ke liye rashtriya thermal power corporation ko saunpane ke liye samjhauta gyaapan par hastakshar kiye
 To take over Muzaffarpur Thermal Power Station, a subsidiary company named 'vaishali Power Generating Company Limited' with NTPC on 06 / 9 / 2006 - Contribution of 51% of equity; And the remaining equity was contributed by the Bihar State Electricity Board
 10 april, 2008 ko company kaa naam 'kanti bijli utpaada nigam limited' rakhaa gaya tha
 The current equity is 64
57% by NTPC and 35
43% by BSEB
 company maujuuda ikai ke punarnirmaan or aadhunikeekaran kar rahaa he
 The total cost of its repair and modernization is Rs

 The station has an installed capacity of 2X110 MW
 donon ikaiyaan naveekaran or aadhunikeekaran ke adheen hai
 An additional 220X2 MW capacity is being built and is likely to be completed by December 2014
 march 2013 main, do puraani ikaayiyon kaa naveekaran kaary puraa hua
 MTPS commenced commercial generation from 1 November 2013 with the installation of 94 MW
 yah pehali peedi he 2002 ke baad se 11 varshon main Google Image Labeler is a game feature of Google Image Search, which allows users to label random images to help improve the quality of Google's image search results
 31 agast 2006 ko google ne beta ke rup main yah seva shuru kii
 Luis von Ohn developed the ESP game, a game in which two people are imaged together, who cannot communicate with each other except to learn about or imply the matching label of each image
 ESP Sports is licensed by Google as Google Image Labeler
 samay ke saath khilaadiyon ne is khel main vibhinn sookshm parivartan dekhe hai
 In the early months, until about November 2006, you could see your partner's projections during the game when you mouse over the image
 jab "sahaj durupyog" prarambh hua tab aap khel ke dauraan dekh sakate the ki kya aapkaa saathi un shabdon kaa upyog kar rahaa he
 The game was changed so that you could just click "see partner estimates" at the end of the game and know what he typed
 farvari 2007 main khel kii sanrachana main parivartanon dwaara antat "sahaj durupyog" roak diya gaya
 During the first few months of 2007, regular players began to identify a group of images that communicated to the "robot" partner, always identical labels in the same order
 anumaanatah isamen 13 march 2007 se parivartan hua he
 Most of the images seen suddenly are brand new and older images come with extensive unlimited lists
 yatha 4 may 2007 khel main moulik or mahatvapurn parivartan kiye gaye hai
 Now players have 2 minutes, instead of 90 seconds
 100 ank prati chhavi ke bajaay, ucch vishistataa ko puraskrit karne ke liye ankon main vividhta he
 "man" can get 50 points, while "bill Gates" can get 140 points
 7 agast 2007 ko ek or parivartan kiya gaya
 Instead of showing the value of each match's points during the match, the values of each match are shown against the matching word at the end of the game
 yah vishisht banaam saamaanya labling kaa sahi maan dekhnaa bahut aasaan bana detaa he
 Another change was observed on 15 October 2007
 lagata he nayaa sanskaran jari kiya gaya or phir waapas le liya gaya
 In the new version you can only see the image you are labeling, whereas in the old version images were collected at the bottom of the screen as you play
 anya parivartan sookshm hai, udhaaharan ke liye nae sanskaran main ank hare aksharon main hai or puraane sanskaran main laal rang main
 sabase mahatvapurn parivartan yah he ki chhavi parivartan ke dauraan ghadi freez ho jaati he or anivarytah prayukt samay ko khel ke do minuton main se gata diya jaataa he
 These changes appear to have been fully implemented from 18 October 2007
 upyogkarta kii jodi betaratib dhang se online rahane vaale or is suvidha kaa upyog karne vaale ek saathi ke saath milaai jaati he
 Users can be registered players, who can accumulate the total points of all played games or can be guests who only play one game at a time
 note karen ki khilaadi duniya bhar se aate hai, jinamein kuch apni-apni angrezi kaa abhyaas karne vaale ho sakate hai, yani america or british angrezi kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 When a disproportionate number of players are online, the player must play against a group of already recorded words
 maujuuda niyam lagu hote hai
 For changes to the rules, see the History section
 Over a period of 2 minutes, the user and his / her partner will be shown the same set of images and asked to provide the label as far as possible until each image they describe is described
 When the user's label matches the partner's label, they both receive points and can move on to the next image until the time is up
 kisi chhavi ko chhod kar aage badhanaa sambhav he lekin donon upyogkartaaon ko aisa karne ke liye sahamat hona hoga
 Depending on the specificity of the answer, one can get between 50 and 150 marks
 150 ank durlabh he, lekin kisi naam yaa vishisht shabd ke liye 140 ank die ja sakate hai, bhale hi shabd chhavi kii vartanee main maujuud ho
 Only 50 marks can be earned for less specific words like "tree" or "man"
 sateekta kii kabhi koi jaanch nahin kii jaati he, jisaki vajah se agar donon khilaadiyon ne shani grah kii chhavi ke liye "brihaspati" tip kiya ho, to ve shaayad donon hi 140 ank hasil karenge
 Labels that have been agreed upon by previous users may be shown in the "beyond limits" list and may not be used in the game round
 kuch khilaadiyon ko lagata he ki khel chhaviyon ke abhas ko hilaa detaa he or kabhi-kabhi yah pehle khilaadi dwaara tip kiye gaye shabdon ko letaa he anya khilaadi ke liye "seemaa se pare" suchi bana detaa he
 In other words, words beyond the boundary can be unilateral, odd
 yah nishchit rup se lagaataar prastut hone vaali us sthiti kii vyakhya karata he jab lagata he ki saathi "car", "pakshi," yaa "ladki" jaise shabd bhi nahin soch pate hai
 Rarely, at the end of the match does it become clear that the two players had a different image
 shaayad yah sirf ek truti he, yaa shaayad yah dekhne ke liye pariksha he ki log kitni jaldi aage nikal jate hai jab unke vivaran mail nahin khate, lekin yah beyimaani karne vaale logon ko dekhne ke liye karyanvit tantra ho saktaa he, jab vibhinn chhaviyon ke liye shabd samaan hon
 kai baar, ek upyogkarta kaa computer ek nai chhavi ko lod karne main vifal ho jaataa he, yaa pehle dikhaai gai chhavi kaa pradarshan jari rakhata he
 Even at such times, there is a need for both players to "get ahead" mutually
 120 second samay kii samaapti ke baad, khel khatm ho jaataa he
 Users can see for the first time their fellow user's name, their points for the game and individual points accumulated so far
 inaki tulana tiimon ke liye dainik ucch ank or saarvkalik vyaktigat ucch ankon se kii jaati he
 Google is betting on the competitiveness of users in reaching higher marks to increase the number of images it receives
 khel kii samaapti par screen anya khilaadi dwaara anumaan lagaae gaye labalon kii suchi sahit khel ke dauraan prastut sabhi chhaviyon ko dikhaata he
 The images themselves then establish links to the websites where those images were found and can be searched for further information to satisfy your curiosity
 khel keval manoranjan ke liye pariklpit nahin he
 While the feature is fun for users, Google also has a smart way of making sure their search terms match the right images
 match kiya gaya prayek shabd google chhavi khoj kaa upyog karte hue prayukt sateek database ke nirmaan main google kii madad karata he
 Without human tagging of images, Google Image Search relied on image references in the past
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek tasviir jiskaa sheershak ho "bill gates kaa chitra", ho saktaa he "bill gates" khoj shabd se sambhavit rup main judaa ho
 The Google Image Labeler relies on people who tag the meaning or content of the image, rather than searching for references to where the image was used
 chhavi ke bare main adhik jaankaree sanchit karte hue, google kisi upyogkarta kii khoj ke jawaab main chhavi kii khoj ke anek sambhav maarg sangrahit karata he
 While these rules are not explained on the screen game of the game, some of these are actually explained on the help page
 anya muddon main shaamil hai: Less than a month after starting, the game began to be misused
 Google seemed to be a victim of spam by the words of the following list: abrasives, accretion, bequeathing, carcinoma, congenita, diphosphonate, entrepreneurialism, forbearance, and Google y
 Because players could see their partner's reaction at the end of each round, they began to know that other players were using these words
 phir kuch logon ne manoranjan or ank badhaane ke liye apane jawaab main in shabdon ko shaamil kiya
 As of February 7, 2007, Google made changes to the game to reduce abuse
 uparokt suchi ko shabdon ko filter kiya gaya
 Also, some images that became motivators for random words immediately came up with "your partner wants to get ahead"
 On 13 March 2007, the game's revision, for some time, removed "trigger images", but as of March 27, they have returned to the game
 is lekh main sanyukt raashtra sangh ne ab tak jin vivaadon hal karne main safalataa paayi he, unka varnan kiya gaya he
 In January 1946, the Soviet Union sent Russian troops to the Azerbaijan region of Iran
 jis par 19 janvari, 1946 isvi main iran ne suraksha parishad se sahaayta kii yachana kii
 The Council succeeded in ending the Russia and Iran dispute by direct negotiations, and on 21 May 1946, Russian forces evacuated Iran

 Due to a dispute over the question of equal currency in 1948 AD, Russia blocked the blockade of Berlin, which led to the dissolution of East and West Germany
 Finally, the United Nations ended its blockade on May 12, 1942

 There was a possibility of World War but the Security Council succeeded in ending the Korea War in July 1951 AD through negotiations and military action
 ise sanyukt raashtra sangh kii ullekhneey safalataa mana jaataa he
 The question of Kashmir between India and Pakistan remains serious even today
 oktober 1947 isvi main kashmir par prabhutv sthapit karne ke liye bharat va pakistan main yuddh prarambh ho gaya or 1 janvari 1949 isvi ko suraksha parishad ne donon pakshon main yuddh band kara diya
 In 1965 AD, due to Kashmir problem, there was second India and Pakistan war and in 1971, third indo-pak war

 dwitiya vishwa yuddh main sena ke ucch stareey general staff ke sandeshon ko kutabaddh karne ke liye yaa unhen gupt bhashaa main likhane ke liye prayog kii gai
 Cryptography, or cryptology, is derived from the Greek word κρυπτός, cryptos and γράφω grapho or -λογία, lojia
 inke arth hai kramshah chupa hua rahasy or main likhata hoon
 It is the process of studying any hidden information
 aadhunik samay main, kryptographi yaa kuta-lekhan ko ganit or computer vigyaan donon kii ek shakha mana jaataa he or soochna siddhant, computer suraksha or ejineering se kaafii zyada judaa hua he
 Encoding applications exist in many forms in technologically advanced societies
 udhaaharan ke liye - atm card, computer password or electronic vaanijya - ye sabhi kutalekhan par nirbhar karte hai
 Until modern times, cryptography was often referred to simply as the process of encryption or encoding, meaning the process of converting ordinary information) into an obscure or barely understood medium
 dikripshan isaki vipareet prakriya he jisamen saadhaaran gupt likhaawat ko saadhaaran paathya main badla jaataa he
 a cryptogram is a pair of algorithms that form decoding and vice versa
 gughalekh kii vistrut prakriya ko donon ke dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he elgorithm or har udhaaharan main ek kunjee ke dwaara
 This is a secret parameter for a particular message exchange context
 Keys are very important because ciphers without variable keys are brittle and therefore less useful to most members
 aitihaasik rup se, sifer kaa upyog sidhe ancripshan yaa dicripshan ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 They were used without any additional processes such as authentication or integrity checks
 bolchaal kii bhashaa main "code yaa kuta " shabd kaa upyog aksar ancripshan kii kisi bhi vidhi ke arth main yaa arth ko chupaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 However, code or code has a more specific meaning in cryptography or cryptography; It means the replacement of a unit of common text with a code word
 kuta kaa upyog ab gambhir kutalekhan main nahin kiya jaataa he-ikai padon ke rup main aisi chizon ke liye sanyogvash hone vaale apwaadon ke alaava
 - Because properly selected ciphers are more practical and more secure than the best codes and are more receptive to computers
 kuch log angreji main kryptographi or kryptology shabdon kaa upyog ek duusare ke sthaan par karte hai, jabaki kuch anya log kryptographi shabd kaa upyog vishesh rup se kryptographi kii takneekon kaa upyog karne ke liye karte hai or kryptologyshbd kaa upyog kryptographi or kript analysis ke sanyukt adhyayan ke liye karte hai
 English is a more flexible language than any other language in which cryptology or cryptology is used in the second sense above, in English Wikipedia, the common term used is cryptography
 kryptographi yaa kryptology main upyogi bhashaaon ke lakshanik gunon kaa adhyayan jaise aankadon kii barambharataa, varna sangyojan, saarvbhaumik praaroop aadi ko kryptolingvistic kehalaata he
 Prior to the modern era, cryptography was concerned only with confidential messages - the conversion of the message from an unsubstantiated form to a non-unscripted form, and then to the other end
 haal ke dashakon main, is kshetra main vistaar hua he, gopneeyata ke muddon se pare, isamen kai or chijen shaamil ho gai hai, jaise sandesh kii akhandta kii jaanch, bhejne vaale / praapt karne vaale kii pahchaan kaa pramanikaran, digital hastakshar s, interactive saboot or dusron ke bich surakshit abhikalan , The oldest form of secret writing required little more than local pen and paper
 kyonki adhikansh log ise nahin pard sakate the
 Additional literacy, or anti-literacy, required actual coding
 mukhya clasical sifer prakaar hai sthanantaran gughalekh yaa transposishan sifer, jo ek sandesh main varnon ke kram ko punah vyavasthit karata he or pratisthaapan bijlekh yah varnon yaa varnon ke samooh ko anya varnon yaa varnon ke samooh ke saath vyavasthit tareeke se pratisthapit karata he, kisi bhi peshkash kaa saral sanskaran udhyami virodhiyon se gopneeyata ke saath or ab bhi nahin he
 An early substitution cipher was the Caesar cryptogram, in which each character in the normal text is replaced by a character in place of a fixed number
 ise julius seizar ke naam par yah naam mila, unhone sainya abhiyaanon ke dauraan apane general se baatcheet karne ke liye ise 3 ke shift ke saath prayog kiya
 Just like boolean algebra is access-3 code
 ancripshan sanchaar main gopneeyata ko sunishchit karata he, jaise jasoos, sainya netaaon or rajanyik ke vaartalap
 Also records of several old Hebriu ciphers are also found
 kaam sutara main kryptographi kaa upyog premiyon ke dwaara bina kisi baadha ke baatcheet karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 Steganography also developed earlier in ancient times
 iskaa ek purana udhaaharan herodots se miltaa he jisamen ek sandesh ko chupaaya gaya-ek das ke munde hue sar par bane hue tetu ko fir se uge baalo ke neeche chupa diya gaya
 Modern examples of steganography are the use of invisible ink, micro dot and digital watermarks to hide information
 clasical sifer ke dwaara utpann sifer text hameshaa plane text ke bare main sankhyikeey soochna prakat karte hai, jiskaa upyog aksar unhen todane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In the 9th century, almost all such ciphers became more or less brittle by a known attacker after the discovery of frequency analysis by the Arab mathematician Polymath, Al Kindi
 is tarah ke clasical sifer abhi bhi lokapriy hai, haalaanki adhikansh paheli ke rup main hai ) multah sabhi sifer kript analysis ke liye kamjor bane rahe, jab tak 1467 main leon battista alberty ne spasht rup se poli alpha betic gughalekh kaa vikaas nahin kiya haalaanki is baat kaa sanket he ki yah pracheen arab ganitagya jaise al-kindi ke liye gyaat tha
 Alberti's new technology used different ciphers for different parts of the message, he also discovered perhaps the first automatic cipher device, a wheel that executes the partial sensation of his invention
 bahu varni vigener sifer main encripshan ek kunjee shabd kaa prayog karata he, jo us varna pratisthaapan ko niyantrit karata he jis ke aadhaar par kunjee shabd ke varna kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Babbage in the mid-1800s demonstrated that these types of multi-cipher ciphers are partially vulnerable to detailed frequency analysis techniques
 haalaanki aavriti vishleshan kai cifron ke viruddh ek shaktishaalee or saamaanya takanic he, fir bhi encripshan praayogic rup se prabhaavshaalee tha; kai bhavi encripshan vigyaani is takanic se agyaat the
 Breaking a message without using frequency analysis was essential knowledge for the cipher used, and perhaps also for the key involved in the action
 is prakaar jasusi, rishwatakhori, chori, dharmatyag aadi adhik aakarshak drushtikon ban gaye
 In the 19th century it was finally recognized that the secrecy of the cipher's algorithm is not a sensing modality or practical protection; In fact it was later felt that the appropriate cryptographic scheme should be preserved even if the adversary fully understood the cipher algorithm
 kunjee kii gopneeyata ek hamale ke antargat gopneeyata banaaye rakhane ke liye, ek achche sifer ke liye paryaapt honi chahie
 This basic principle was first clearly established in 1883 by Auguste Karkhof and commonly known as the Karkhof theory; Alternatively and more explicitly it was re-established by Claude Shennon, inventor of the basic laws of information theory and theoretical cryptography, he also gave 'the Enemy Knows the System' as Shennon's Maxim
 vibhinn bhautik sadhano or upkarnon kaa upyog sifers kii sahaayta ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 One of the oldest is the Sky Tail of ancient Greece, a rod used by spartans for the transposition of a cipher

 The discovery of the multi-word cipher was followed by more sophisticated tools such as Albert's cipher disc, the Tabula Recta scheme of Johannes Trithemius, and the multi-cylinder by Thomas Jefferson

 In addition, computers allow for encryption in any binary format, in contrast to classical ciphers that could only encrypt written language text
 is prakaar, computer ne bhashaai kriptenalytic drushtikon ko pratisthapit kiya
 Many computer ciphers are reflected by their operation on a binary bit sequence, in contrast to classical or mechanical schemes usually directly expressing traditional characters

 Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have always been ahead of crypt analysis; This is typically the case that the use of quality ciphers is very effective

 Message authentication codes are very similar to cryptographic hash functions, the only difference being that a secret key is used to authenticate the hash value on receipt

 In a 1976 ground-breaking paper Whitefield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public key cryptography
 jisamen do alag lekin ganitiya rup se sambandhit kusiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he; ek saarvajanik kunjee or nijee kunjee
 The public key is constructed in such a way that the computation of one key is impractical from another
 fir bhi ve aavashyak rup se sambandhit hai
 Instead, the two keys are generated secretly, as an unrelated pair
 itihaaskaar david kahan ne saarvjaanik kunjee krypto graphy ko "punarjagran main utpann ek bahuvarni pratisthaapan se lekar kshetra main ek nai sarvaadhik krantikari avadharana "ke rup main varnit kiya he
 Public key In a crypto system, the public key is freely distributed, while its pairs' private key must be secret
 saarvajanik kunjee kaa upyog praroopik rup se encripshan ke liye kiya jaataa he, jabaki nijee yaa gupt kunjee kaa upyog dikripshan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Diffie and Hellman demonstrated that public key cryptography is possible by displaying the diffie-hellman key exchange protocol

 In 1997, it became publicly known that asymmetric key cryptography was discovered by James H
 Ellis at GCHQ, a British intelligence organization and in the pre-1970s both diffie-hellman and RSA algorithms Had already been developed and by Clifford Cokes)

 In addition to encryption, public key cryptography can also be used to implement digital signature schemes
 ek digital hastakshar ek saadhaaran hastakshar kii yaad taaja karata he; un donon ke paas aise lakshan hote hai ki ek upyogkarta ke liye unka utpaadan asana hota he, lekin kisi or ke liye jaalsaji karnaa mushkil hota he
 Digital signatures can be permanently tied to the component of the message being signed; Then they cannot be sent from one document to another for any effort
 digital hastakshar yojanaon main, do elgoritham hote hai; ek hastakshar ke liye jisamen sandesh par kaarywahi karne ke liye ek gupt kunjee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or doosraa satyaapan, ke liye jisamen hastakshar kii vaidyata kii jaanch karne ke liye sandesh ke saath ek saarvajanik milan kunjee prayukt kii jaati he
 RSA and DSA are the two most popular digital signature schemes

 Public key algorithms are mostly based on the computational complexity of problems from "difficult" problems, often number theory

 While diffie-hellman and DSA are related to the problem of discrete logarithms

 Due to the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public key algorithms involve activities such as modular multiplication and optimization
 jo adhikansh block sifers vishesh rup se praroopik kunjee aakaar se yukt block sifers main prayukt takneekon kii tulana main compyutational rup se adhik manhage hote hai
 As a result, public key crypto systems are usually hybrid crypto systems, in which a rapid high-quality symmetric key encryption algorithm is used for the message itself, while the corresponding symmetric key is sent along with the message, but the public key algorithm It is encrypted using
 isi prakaar, sankar hastakshar yojanayen aksar prayukt kii jaati hai jinamein ek kryptographic hesh function kii gananaa kii jaati he or keval parinami hesh ko digital rup se hastakshar kiya jaataa he
 The purpose of cryptanalysis is to detect any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a cryptographic scheme
 is prakaar se iske upsanskaran kii anumati dena
 It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken
 cloude shannon ne bel leboratories main unke dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke kaary ke sambandh main sabit kiya ki ek samay pad sifer bhangur nahin he, unhone bataaya ki mul padaarth yadrichhik hote hai or fir se kabhi bhi kaam main nahin liye ja sakate hai or bataaya ki isamen sabhi sambhav hamalavar hote hai or inaki lambaai sandesh ke baraabar yaa usase adhik hoti he
 Most ciphers other than a time pad, can be broken by a substantial computational effort by brute force attack, but the amount of effort required may exponentially depend on the size of the key, compared to the effort required to use the cipher, such In that case, effective protection can be achieved if it is proved that the effort required is beyond the capacity of any opponent
 arthath, yah darshaya janaa chahie ki sifer ko todane ke liye koi prabhavi vidhiyaan nahin khoji ja sakati he
 Since no such demonstrations are currently conducted, the one-time tree is the only theoretically unbreakable cipher in today's time
 kriptanalisis hamalon kii kai kismein hai or inhen kai tareekon se vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 a general distinction is made based on what an attacker knows and what capabilities are available
 sifer text ekmaatr hamale main, krypto vishleshak ke liye keval sifer text uplabdh hota he
 In, the cipher text and its associated plane text are available to the crypt analyzer
 In a selected plane text attack, the crypt analyzer selects a plane text and studies the cipher text associated with it; An example of this is gardening used by the British during World War II
 antat ek chaynit sifer text hamale main kript vishleshak sifer text ke chayan or isse sambandhit plane text kaa adhyayan karne main sakasham hota he
 Also often such mistakes occur in the use or design of one; For some historical examples, see Enigma's Cryptanalysis) samamit kunjee sifer ke kript analysis main praroopik rup se shaamil he stream sifer yaa block sifer ke viruddh hamalon kii khoj karnaa
 It is more effective than any attack against a skilled cipher
 udhaaharan ke liye, di i es ke viruddh ek saadhaaran broot force hamale ko ek gyaat plane text or 2 55 dikripshan kii zarurat hoti he, yah us bindu par pahunchne ke liye lagbhag aadhi sambhav kunjiyon par prayaas karata he jahaan behatar sambhaavnaaen hoti hai
 But this does not give sufficient assurance; a linear crypt analysis against DES requires 2 43 known plane text and approximately 2 43 DES activities
 yah broot force hamalon par ek acha sudhaar he
 Public key algorithms are based on the computational complexity of different problems
 inamen se sabase prasiddh he purnank gunan khand 
 But discrete logarithm problems are also very important
 adhikansh saarvajanik kunjee kript vishleshan, in computesnal samasyaon, yaa unamem se kuch ko prabhavi rup se sulajhane ke liye sankhyikeey elgoritham kaa upyog karte hai
 
 udhaaharan ke liye, asatat laghuganak ke dirghavrittiya vakr aadhaarit sanskaran ko hal karne ke liye sarvottam gyaat elgoritham bahut adhik samay lete hai, isaki tulana main gunan khand ke liye sarvottam gyaat elgoritham saamaan aakaar kii samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye kam samay lete hai
 In this way, encryption techniques based on multiplication blocks should use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques in order to achieve the equivalent resistance to resistance to attack
 isi kaaran se, dirghavrittiya vakr par aadhaarit saarvajanik kunjee krypto pranali 1990 ke madhya main hui khoj se bahut lokapriy ho gayi he
 When pure cryptanalysis uses a weakness of the algorithm, other attacks on the crypto system are based on the use of algorithms in real devices and are called side chain attacks
 yadi ek kript vishleshak ke liye samay kii maatra uplabdh he or upkaran ne plane text kii ek sankhya ko encript kiya, yaa usne ek password yaa pin kerector main kisi truti kaa pataa lagaaya, to vah ek sifer ko todane ke liye ek timming atek kaa upyog kar saktaa he, jo vishleshan ke liye pratirodhi he
 An attacker can also study the length and pattern of the message to obtain important information; This is called traffic analysis, and can be very useful for a warning conflict

 Note, however, that the distinction between cryptographic primitives and crypto systems is not definitive; For example, the RSA algorithm is sometimes considered a crypto system and sometimes a primitive

 By 1999, France significantly prohibited the domestic use of cryptography, although it granted concessions to many of them

 There are strict restrictions on the use of cryptography in many countries

 In the United States, cryptography is legal for home use, but there are many differences on legal issues related to cryptography

 Many Western countries have strictly regulated the export of cryptography in some places, possibly due to the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that cryptography would continue to be important for continued national security

 Mahamahopadhyay Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi) was a great mathematician and great astrologer of the modern period of India
 aap hindi sahityakar evam nagari ke prabal pakshdhar bhi the
 He was born on 26 March 1855 in Khajuri village near Kashi on the banks of river Varuna
 inke pita kaa naam krupaludutt dvivedi or mata kaa naam laachi tha
 At the age of eight, he was initiated into an auspicious time, two months before his sacrifice
 prarambh se hi inamen adwitiya pratibha dekhi gai
 In a very short time, he became fully aware of Hindi quantities
 jab inkaa yagyopavit sanskaar hua to ve bhalee-bhanti hindi likhane-padhane lage the
 When he started studying Sanskrit, he could remember more than fifty verses of 'amarkosh' in one day
 inhone varanasi sanskrit kalege ke pan durgadatt se vyakaran or pan devkrishna se ganit evam jyotish kaa adhyayan kiya
 His great talent in mathematics and astrology impressed Mahamopadhyay Bapudev Shastri
 kai avasaron par bapudev ji ne ek avasar par likhaa, 'shri sudhakar shastri ganite brihaspatisam:
 ' sudhakar ji ne ganit kaa gahan adhyayan kiya or bhinn-bhinn granthon par apana 'shodh' prastut kiya
 He also studied western texts of mathematics by studying English and French languages
 bapudev ji ne apane 'siddhant shiromani' granth kii tippanee main paashchaatya vidwaan dalhos ke siddhant kaa anuwaad kiya tha
 Dwivedi ji, while implying the proof of the above principle, requested Bapudev ji to reconsider it
 is prakaar baees varsh kii hi aayu main sudhakar ji prakand vidwaan ho gaye or unke nivas sthaan khajuri main bharat ke kone-kone se vidhyaarthee padhane aane lage
 In 1883, Dwivedi became the librarian of Saraswati Bhavan
 vishwa ke hastlikhit pustakaalayon main iskaa vishisht sthaan he
 On 16 February 1887, on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Jubilee, he was conferred with the title of 'maha Mahopadhyay'
 san 1890 main pandit baapu dev shastri ke sevanivrutt hone ke baad ve unke sthaan par ganit evam jyotish ke adhyaaapak niyukt hue
 He was the chairman of the mathematics department of Queen's College, Benares, from where he retired in 1905
 unke baad prasiddh ganitagya ganesh prasad vibhaagadhyaksh bane
 Dwivedi ji made an inaccuracy in 'naticle Allmanak' to be published in 'greenich'
 'natical olmainak' ke sampadakon evam prakashkon ne inke prati kritagyata prakat kii or inaki bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii
 Due to this incident, their influence greatly increased in the country and abroad
 tatkaaleen rajkeey sanskrit kalege ke principal dow venice ke virodh karne par bhi governor ne inhen ganit or jyotish vibhaag kaa pradhanadhyaapak niyukt kiya
 Sudhakar used to meditate on the questions and principles of mathematics equally
 buggi par nagar main ghoomte hue bhi ve kaagaj pencil lekar ganit ke kisi jatil prashn ko hal karne main lage rahete
 Dwivedi ji's major works on mathematics and astrology are as follows: inhone sanskrit main anek granth likhe hai jinamein se adhikansh jyotishiya vishyon par hai
 The major Sanskrit texts are- hindi main rachit ganit evam jyotish sambandhi pramukh granth ye hai- Dwivedi ji was also a great literary and poet
 hindi or sanskrit main unki sahitya sambandhi kai rachanaayen hai
 No mathematics, astrology and Sanskrit scholar did as much service to Hindi as he did
 dvivedi ji or bhaaratendu babu harishchandra main badi mitrataa thi
 Both were unique devotees of Hindi and wanted the rise of Hindi
 dvivedi ji aashu rachana main bhi patu the
 After seeing the construction of the bridge at Rajghat in Kashi, he narrated this couplet to Bharatendu Babu
 bhaaratendu babu is dohe se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone dvivedi ji ko jo do bidaa paan ghar khaane ko diya usamen do swarna mudraayen rakh deen
 Dwivedi did twenty-five volumes of Malik Muhammad Jayasi's epic 'padmavat' with Teeka Grierson
 yah granth us samay tak duruh mana jaataa tha, kintu is tikaa se uski sundarataa main chaar chaand lag gaye
 In the role of 'padmavat' 'sudhakar Chandrika Tika', Dwivedi wrote: - dvivedi ji ram ke anany bhakt the or unki kavitaayen praaia: rambhakti se otprot hoti thim
 In the beginning of all his books he has praised Rama
 dvivedi ji vyangatmak kavitaayen bhi yadakada likhte the
 He had great displeasure with the British and had a great affliction on the plunging condition of India
 raja shivaprasad sitare hind kii hindi ke prati anudaar niti or angrejipan kaa andhanukaran na to dvivedi ji ko pasand tha or na bhaaratendu babu ko hi
 Urdu, Persian and Arabic were dominated in India during Dwivedi's time
 hindi bhashaa kaa na to koi nishchit swaroop ban sakaa tha or na use uchit sthaan praapt tha
 Dwivedi was an active contributor to the agitation organized by the Nagri Pracharini Sabha to place Hindi and Nagari script in the courts of the United Provinces
 is sambandh main sanyukt praant ke tatkaaleen asthaayee rajyapal sar james latush se kaashi main dvivedi ji ke saath nagariprachaarini sabha ke anya paanch sadsy mili the
 Dwivedi ji proved that the Nagari script can be written quickly, by participating in the competition with an Urdu cleric himself and writing the article in beautiful and clear Nagari script, two minutes before the scheduled time
 is prakaar hindi or nagari lipi ko bhi nyaayalayon main sthaan mila
 Dwivedi ji was of the view that Hindi should be given such a form that it should automatically become the language of general public use and no class should understand that Hindi is being imposed on it
 unhone panditau hindi kaa virodh kiya or unke prabhaav se muhaavareydaar saral hindi kaa prayog panditon ke bhi samaaj main hone laga
 He appealed through his 'ram Kahani' that Hindi should be written in the way people speak it in their homes
 jo videshi shabd hindi main apana ek rup lekar prachlit ho gaye the, unhen badalane ke paksh main ve na the
 He was also the editor of the Nagri Prapacharini Granthamala and later the Deputy Chairman and Chairman of the Sabha

 There was not even a trace of the narrowness prevailing among the pandits of Kashi at that time
 unhone siddh kiya ki videsh yatra se koi dharmahani nahin
 On 30 August 1910, while presiding over a huge assembly of Kashi, he appealed in a resounding tone that those who had been deported due to the vilayat gaan should be recaptured

 Theism is the name of belief in the existence of God in Western philosophy
 sansar ke vishwaason ke itihaas main ishwar kii kalpana anek roopon main kii gai he or uske astitv ko siddh karne ke liye anek yuktiyaan di gai hai
 The main among them are: ishwar kaa swaroop - maanvanuroop vyaktitvayukt ishwar 
 The producer, operator and regulator of this world is a human-like body, the supremely powerful God with attitudes
 vah kisi ek sthaan par rahata he or vahiin se sab sansar kii dekhbhaal karata he, logon ko paap punya kaa fal detaa he evam bhakthi or prarthana karne par logon ke du:kha or vipatti main sahaayta karata he
 From his abode, he sends his son Prophets, Rishimunis from time to time to teach the true religious path in this world and sometimes incarnates himself in some form or the other
 dushton kaa daman or sajjanon kaa uddhaar karata he
 This view is called Theism in Western philosophy
 srishtikarta maatr ishwarwad - kuch darshanik yah maanate hai ki ishwar to srishtikarta maatr he or usne sristi rach di he ki vah swayan apane niyamon se chal rahi he
 He doesn't mean anything anymore

 Sarva Khalu and Brahma - This whole world is Brahma, according to this theory, the world and God are not separate objects
 bhagwaan or sansar ek hi hai
 The world is only the body of God, in whose particle it penetrates
 brahmaujagat or jagatubrahm
 It is also called monotheism
 paashchaatya deshon main is prakaar ke mat kaa naam pathysm he
 Brahma is also beyond the world
 is matvaale, jinako paashchaatya deshon main "pan anthist" kehete hai, yah maanate hai ki jagat main bhagwaan kii parisamapti nahin hoti
 The world is only a part of it
 jagat shant he, simit he or isamen bhagwaan ke sabhi gunon kaa prakaash nahin he
 God is eternal, infinite and imperceptible
 jagat main unki satta or swaroop kaa bahut thode ansh main prakatya he
 According to this view, all the universe is Brahman, but not all the universe is the universe
 ajatvaad, ajativaad athwa jagadrahit shuddh brahmavaad- is mat ke anusar ishwar ke atirikt or koi satta hi nahin he
 Brahma is everywhere
 jagat naam kii vastu na kabhi utpann hui, na he or na hogi
 What we see as the world is just imagination, false illusion, which is lost by knowledge
 vaastavik satta keval vikararahit shuddh sachchidanand brahm kii hi he jisamen sristi na kabhi hui, na hogi
 a question also arises under theism whether God is one or many
 kuch log anek devi devataaon ko maanate hai
 They are called polytheists
 ve ek dev ko nahin jaanate
 Some people consider the world gods to be two gods - one God and the other Satan
 ek achchhaayiyon kaa srashta or doosraa buraaiyon kaa
 Some people believe that evil is only a shadow of God
 bhagwaan ek hi he, shaitan uski mayasakti kaa naam he jiske dwaara sansar main sab dosha kaa prasarhai, par jo swayan bhagwaan ke niyantran main rahati he
 Some people believe in the power of pure Brahman without fear
 unke anusaar sansar shuddh brahm kaa prakaash he, usamen swayan koi dosha nahin he
 It is due to our ignorance that we see faults
 purna gyaan ho jane par sabko mangalamay hi dikhaai padegaa
 This view is called pure Brahmanism
 isi ko advaitvaad athwa aikyavad kehete hai
 Some of the many tips given in proving theism in Western and Indian philosophy are: manushyamaatr ke man main ishwar kaa vichaar or usamen vishwaas janmajaat he
 It is difficult to resolve, so God must be there
 isko aantological, arthath pratyay se satta kii siddhi karanevaali yukti kehete hai
 By applying the world-work-cause-rule to the world, it is said that just as every work has its causal and causal reasons, similarly the whole world must also have its cause and cause and it is God
 sansar kii sabhi kriyaaon kaa koi na koi prayojan yaa uddeshy hota he or isaki sab kriyaayein niyampurvak or sangathit reeti se chal rahi hai
 Therefore, its regulator, connector and manager will be a man of God
 jis prakaar maanav samaaj main sab logon ko niyantran main rakhane ke liye or aparaadhon kaa dand evam upakaaron or sevaaon kaa puraskaar dene ke liye raja athwa rajvyavastha hoti he usee prakaar samast sristi ko niyam par chalaane or paap punya kaa fal denevaala koi sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or nyaayakari paramatma avashya he
 This is called a moral or moral tactic
 yogi or bhakt log apane dhyaan or bhajan main nimagn hokar bhagwaan kaa kisi na kisi rup main darshan karke krutharth or trupt hote dikhaai padate he 
 The preaching of the existence of God is found in all the scriptures of the world, so the common people and religious people believe in the existence of God
 is yukti ko shabdpraman kehete hai
 Atheists have tried to cut all these tips

 Swaniki or phonology is the branch of linguistics that studies the sounds spoken by humans
 yah boli jane vaali dhvaniyon ke bhautik gun, unke shaareerik utpaadan, shravan grahan or tantrika-shaareerik bodh kii prakriyaaon se sambandhit he
 Swaniki was studied in ancient India from about 2500 years ago, we find evidence of it in his Sanskrit grammatical treatise Ashtadhyayi composed by Panini in 500 BC, which describes in detail the location of utterances and the method of pronunciation
 has been done
 aaj kii adhiktar bhartiya lipiyon me vyanjanon kaa sthaan panini ke vargeekaran par aadhaarit he
 In modern times, the study of Swaniki started with the efforts of Joshua Steele and Alexander Bell etc
 bhashaa kii laghuttam ikai 'swan' he
 It is also named sound
 dhwani ke abhaav main bhashaa kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati he
 In linguistics, the study context of phonetics is called 'phonology'
 dhwani shabd dhwan dhaatu main in pratyay ke yoga se bana he
 Phonology has become an important branch in the serious study of linguistics
 iske liye dhvanishastra, dhvanyalochan, swanvigyaan, swaniti aadi naam die gaye hai
 In English, the terms 'phonetics' and 'phonology' are used
 in donon shabdon kii nirmiti greek ke 'phone' se he
 Swann's study reveals three aspects - swan utpann karanevaale vyakti yaa vaktaa ko swanutpaadak kii sangya dete he
 The collector or receiver is the listener, who accepts the sound
 samvahak yaa sanvahan karanevaala madhyam jo mukhyatah vaayu kii tarangon ke rup main hota he
 The essentiality of the three organs is proven automatically in the swan process
 jab mukh ke vibhinn angon main se kinhin do yaa don se adhik avyavayon ke sahyog se dhwani unpann hogi tabhi swan kaa astitv sambhav he
 In the absence of the role of sound-producing components, Swann's existence is impossible
 dhwani-utpaadak avyavon kii upyogi bhoomika ke baad yadi samvahak yaa sanvahan madhyam kaa abhaav hoga, to swan kaa abhas asambhav he
 Suppose a person makes a sound while sitting in an air-tight chamber, then the air wave cannot come out of the chamber and the person outside cannot accept sound
 is prakaar swan prakriya avaruddh ho jaati he
 In the absence of a third organ collector or listener, the existence of sound production automatically becomes zero
 is prakaar swan prakriya main vaktaa, madhyam teenon kaa hona anivaary hota he
 There are two forms of sound that are meaningful and meaningless
 bhashaa vigyaan main keval sarthak dhvaniyon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In the sound production process, air comes out from both the mouth or nose
 is prakaar dhwani ko anunasik tathaa niranunasik do virgo main vibhakt kar sakate hai
 In the pronunciation of the sounds, the air originates from the nasal cavity along with the mouth-sound
 use anunasik dhwani kehete hai
 The sounds in which the vayu originates only from the mouth and mouth are called nirnunasik or oral sounds
 dhwani kii tivrata or mandatha ke aadhaar par use naad, shwaas tathaa japit, teen virgo main vibhakt kar sakate hai
 When the vocal nerves are joined to each other in the production of sound, the wind pushes them out of the middle, such a sound is called sound sound, eg-g, g, j etc
 ise saghosh dhwani bhi kehete hai
 When the vocal nerves are away from each other, the air of expiration comes out easily without friction
 aisi dhwani ko ‘shwaas’ yaa aghosh kehete hai; yatha k, t, p aadi
 When there is a very slow sound, air comes out from any corner of both the vocal cords
 aisi dhwani ko japit dhwani kehete hai
 Phonology has a special importance in language studies because knowledge of other greater units is based on it
 iske hi antargat vibhinn dhwani utpaadak avyavon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 After pure knowledge of swans, pure writing gets a strong foundation
 uccharan main honevaale vividh sandarbhon ke parivartanon kaa gyaan bhi sambhav hota he
 In phonology, the study of various sounds is accompanied by a detailed analysis of the process of their production
 isi adhyayan kram main dhwani utpaadak vibhinn angon kii rachana or unki bhoomika kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he

 Then Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel sent to Guruji in his message that "I am glad that i was happy to lift the ban on the Sangh, only those who were near me at that time can tell 


 i send you my best wishes

 Raghubirsinh which are directly related to the history of Malwa but still in these texts the activities of Rajasthani rulers, their relation with Malwa , Mughal Rajput relations, Malwa policy of Rajasthani rulers, their relation with Mughal and Marathas by writing a truly beautiful and fair history of Marathas in Malwa Buried a stone of naveenatam khojon par aadhaarit 'purv madhyakaalin bharat' da0 raghubeerasingh dwaara likhit aisa granth he jisamen dilli kii tatkaaleen musalamaani sultanate ke utthan, vikaas or patan kaa sarvatha naye dhang se likhaa gaya krambaddh aalochanatmak itihaas he
 The 'great Rebellion Records of Malwa' is a treatise edited by Dr
 Raghubir Singh, who during the Great Rebellion of 1857, the lawyer of Sitamau State was appointed to the Agent to the Governor General, Indore, and the letters sent by him throw light on the events of 1857-58 AD is

 It has twenty UGC programs and thirty five self-funded department courses
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ke chaar lakh chaatr or 400 mahavidhyalay isse jude hai
 This university has a separate engineering college, in which b
tech can be done in five branches of engineering

 In physics, the rotation of the axis of a rotating object is known as precession or aion
 purassaran do tarah kaa hota he- Often we see that the axis of a rotating object changes its position
 duusare shabdon main, ghurnan-aksh swayan kisi anya aksh ke paritah ghurnan kar rahaa hota he
 In astronomy, a rotating or orbital parameter of a celestial body is gradually changed to aion
 aadhe varsh tak surya, akaash ke uttar golardh main rahata he, aadhe varsh tak dakshin golardh me
 While moving from the South Hemisphere to the North Hemisphere, the point of the sky at which the center of the Sun resides is called Vasanthivushuv
 yah vindu taron ke saapeksh sthir nahin he; yah dhire-dhire khisakta rahata he
 This move is called equinox ion or simply anion
 vasantvishuv se chalakar or ek chakkar lagaakar jitne kaal main surya phir vahiin lautataa he utane ko ek sayan varsh kehete hai
 The return of the Sun from a star is called the sidereal year
 yadi vishuv chalata na hota to sayan or nakshatra varsh baraabar hote
 Due to aion there is a difference of few minutes in both the years
 aadhunik naapon ke anusaar ausat nakshatra varsh kaa maan 365 din, 6 ghanta, 9 minute, 9
6 second ke lagbhag or ausat sayan varsh kaa maan 365 din, 5 ghanta, 48 minute, 46
054 second ke lagbhag he
 a practical year should be kept according to the year of sion, otherwise the beginning of the year will not always be there in a season
 hinduon main jo varsh abhi tak prachlit tha vah sayan varsh se kuch minute bada tha
 Therefore, the beginning of the year was moving forward
 udhaahrant: pichley dhai hajaar varshon main 21 yaa 22 din kaa antar pad gaya he
 It is not possible to tell exactly because Suryasiddhanta, Brahmasiddhanta, Aryabhatiya, etc
 have different Varshamanas
 yadi ham log do chaar hajaar varshon tak puraane varshmaan kaa hi prayog karen to sawan bhadon ke maheene us ritu main padenge jab kadaake kaa jaada padataa rahegaa
 That is why the Government of India has now adopted 365
2422 days of cyan year in its national almanac
 ayan kaa ek parinaam yah hota he ki akashiya dhruv, arthath akaash kaa vah bindu jo prithvi ke aksh kii sidh main he, taron ke bich chalata rahata he
 He makes one round in about 26,000 years
 jab kabhi uttar akashiya dhruv kisi chamkile taare ke paas aa jaataa he to vah tara prithvi ke uttar golardh main dhruvatara kahalaane lagata he
 At this time, the north celestial pole is near the first small Saptarshi
 isiilie is taare ko ham dhruvatara kehete hai
 Right now the celestial pole is going near the pole, so the aforesaid star will be called the pole pole for hundreds of years
 lagbhag 5,000 varsh pehle pratham kaaliy naamak tara dhruvatara kahalaane yogya tha
 There was no star in the middle that would be called Dhruvatara
 aaj se 15,000 varsh pehle abhijeet naamak tara dhruvatara tha
 In our Griha Sutras, there is an order to perform Dhruvadarshan on the occasion of marriage
 pratyaksh he ki us samay koi na koi dhruvatara avashya tha
 It has been estimated that this practice must have been around 5,000 years ago
 shatapath brahman main likhaa he ki krittikas purv main udai hoti hai
 Due to this, around 3,000 BC The scripture seems to be because, due to the aeon, the rodents did not rise before and after it
 lattu ko nachaakar bhoomi par ek prakaar rakh dene se ki lattu kaa aksh khadaa na rahakar tirachha rahe, lattu kaa aksh dhire-dhire mandraata rahata he or vah ek shanku parilikhat karata he
 In the same way, the axis of the Earth transcribes a cone whose half-vertex is about 23 degrees
 kaaran yah he ki prithvi thik-thik golakaar nahin he
 The diameter is greater on the Mediterranean
 mote hisaab se ham yah maan sakate hai ki kendriya bhaag shuddh rup se golakar he or uske baahar niklaa bhaag bumadhyarekha par chipka hua ek valay he
 The Sun always attracts the Earth by staying in the plane of the Ravi Marg
 yah aakarshan prithvi ke centre se hokar nahin jaataa, kyonki purvakalpit valay kaa ek khand apekshaakrit surya ke kuch nikat rahata he, doosraa kuch dur
 Attraction falls more on the proximal part, less on the remote
 isliye in aakarshanon kii yah pravriti hoti he ki prithvi ko ghumaakar uske aksh ko ravimaarg ke dharaatal par lamb kar den
 If this rotation is combined with the rotation of the Earth's own axis, then the direction of the resulting rotation axis comes out which is slightly different from the old direction of the Earth's axis, that is, the Earth's axis from its old position to this new position Comes in duusare shabdon main, prithvi kaa aksh ghumta rahata he
 The Moon also helps in rotating this type of axis
 vastut: chandramaa kaa prabhaav surya kii apeksha duuna padataa he
 On doing a subtle calculation, everything comes out exactly as seen by the piercer
 prithvi kii madhyarekha ke foole dravya par surya ke assam aakarshan se prithvi kaa aksh ek shanku parilikhit karata he
 The level of the Chandra Marg makes an angle of 5 degrees from the level of the Ravi Marg
 is kaaran chandramaa prithvi ko kabhi ravimaarg ke upar se khinchataa he, kabhi neeche se
 As a result, the angle between the equator and the surface of the sunway also varies slightly
 jise ''vidolan kehete hai
 Due to the moving of the Earth, both the spring and autumn equinoxes keep moving
 upar bataae gaye ayan ko chandra-saura-ayan kehete hai
 In this, the surface of the Mediterranean varies
 parantu grahon ke aakarshan ke kaaran swayan ravimaarg thodaa vichlit hota he
 This also makes a difference in the position of the equinox
 ise grahiy ayan kehete hai
 Alpha Pagasai, also known as Bayer, is a star located in the region of the Parnin Ash constellation
 yah prithvi se dikhne vaale taron main se 89vaan sab se roshan tara he
 Its brightness seen from Earth is +2
49 magnitude
 alfaa pagasai hamase lagbhag 133 prakaash varsh kii duuri par sthit he
 The alpha pagasai star is also called "marakab" in English, derived from the Arabic "marakab", which means "gene"
 parmparik bhartiya khagolashastra main alfaa pagasai or betaa pagasai ko milakar "purvabhadrapada" nakshatra kaa naam diya jaataa he, jiskaa arth he "pehle vaale kush qadam"
 Alpha Pagasai is the main sequence star of the B9 III range, whose mass is approximately 4 times the mass of our sun and 2
8 times the diameter of our sun
 isaki taare kii nihit chamak suraj kii lagbhag 160 guna he
 Its surface temperature has been estimated at 11,000 Calvin
 khagolashastriyon ne andaaza lagaaya he ki yah apane mukhya anukram jivan ke ant main he or kuch samay main yah hydrogen kaa nabhikeey sanlayan chhodkar helium kaa sanlayan shuru kar degaa
 On reaching this stage it will swell to become a red demon star
 iske pashchaat yah sikudakar apana jivan ek safed boune taare ke rup main ant karegaa

 bharthri katha main do paatr he - bharthri or gopichand, jinase ye katha shuru hoti he
 King Bharthari and Bhanja Gopichand
 bharthri kii katha bihar main, uttarapradesh main, bengal main prachlit he
 Scholars have different opinions about how the story of Bharthari came to be in Chhattisgarh
 nandakishor tiwari ji kaa kahana he ki bengal ke jogi jab ujjain jate the, us yatra ke vakt chhattisgarh main bhi bharthri kii katha prachlit ho gai thi - bharthri or gopichand donon nath-panthi the
 The sect which belongs to the nath-panthi Yogis started in the ninth tenth century
 bengal bihar or uske aasapaas yogi naam kii ek jati rahati thi
 These people did not consider untouchability, did not believe in caste
 bahut hi unnat maansikta ke the ve log
 They were like Nath Panthi Yogis
 nath panthi yogiyon kaa sampradaay nepal main buddha or shaiva sadhano ke mishran se hui thi
 And after that this community spread throughout the Hindi region
 is sampradaay ke log padhe likhe nahin hone ke kaaran ashikshit mana jaataa tha
 But the education that was provided by them, could not give many educated people
 ye log apane ko jogi kehete the
 People rejected him, saying that these people are devoid of scripture
 ye log lok-geeton ke madhyam se logon kaa dil jeet lete the
 Bharathari is called a yogi in Chhattisgarh
 chhattisgadhi bharthri kisi jati vishesh kaa geet nahin he
 Those who sing the song of Bharathari's song are called Yogis
 geet main bhi apane aap ko ve yogi kehete hai: Initially, Bharthari used to sing a single person, he used to sing with Khanjari
 baad main vaadyon ke saath bharthri kaa gayan hone laga
 The instruments included tabla, harmonium, manjira as well as benzo
 dhire dhire iskaa rup badalata gaya or bharthri yogi gaanaa gaate or saath saath naachte bhi he
 It is quite natural that dance has also been included with the song
 na sirf chhattisgarh main balki puure hindi belt main bahut prem se gaaya jaataa he or suna jaataa he
 Folklore travels from one place to another and where it reaches, becomes influenced by the traditions of the place
 chhattisgarh kii bharthri main ham dekhte he ki kai jagah "satnam" kaa ullekh he - Swim daughter satname l o Satnam cult is prevalent in Chhattisgarh, in which Satnam means the glory of the name
 isiliye dhire dhire bharthri main bhi "satnam" shabd ko istemaal kiya gaya he There are many legends about Bharthari
 bharthri ek aisa charitra he jiske bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve yogi bane the
 Bharthari was the king of Ujjain
 ab bharthri kyon yogi banakar rajya chhodkar chale gayi the, iske bare main alag alag kahaniyaan prachlit he jisamen aakhir main gorakhnath ke krupa se sab thik ho jaataa he or bharthri gorakhnath ke shishy ban jate hai
 According to a legend, when Bharthari's wife Pingala falls in love with another man, Bharthari goes away as a monk and leaves the kingdom
 or ek kahani bilkul iske vipareet he jisamen rani pingala pati se behad prem karti he
 In the story, King Bharthari once went hunting
 unhone vahaan dekha ki ek patni ne apane mrit pati kii chita main kud kar apane praan tyaag die
 King Bharthari was very surprised to see the love of that wife
 ve sochane lage ki kya meri patni bhi mujhase itnaa pyaar karti he
 When King Bharthari comes back to his palace and tells this incident to his wife Pingala, Pingala says that she will die only after hearing this news
 chita main kudane ke liye bhi vah jivit nahin rahegi
 King Bharthari thinks that he will take the test of Rani Pingla and see if this is true
 phir se bharthri shikaar khilne jate hai or vahaan se samachar bhejte hai ki raja bharthri kii mrityu ho gai
 Rani Pingala dies on hearing this news
 raja bharthri bilkul tut jaataa he, apane aap ko doshi tehraate hai or vilaap karte hai
 But with the grace of Gorakhnath, Rani Pingala becomes alive
 or is ghatana ke baad raja bharthri gorakhnath ke shishy banakar chale jate hai
 Nandkishore Tiwari ji who did a deep study on the bharatha-chhattisgarhi folklore, and translated it, is very interesting his translation
 neeche unka anuwaad diya gaya he - jisamen bharthri kii mata bharthri ke janm se pehle putr kaamana kii agni se bhun rahi he or phir bharthri kaa janm vrutant he
