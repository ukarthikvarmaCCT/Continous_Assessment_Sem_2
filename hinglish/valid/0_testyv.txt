 panzia, panjeya yaa panji, ek vishaal ekikrut mahadweep tha jiskaa astitv lagbhag 250 million varsh pehle peliojoik or mizozoik yug ke dauraan tha; maujuuda mahadweep apane vartmaan swaroop main isi main se nikal kar aaye hai
 The name was coined in the scientific discussion of Alfred Wegener's theory of continental flow
 apni pustak "da origin of continents and oshans" main unhone mana tha ki sabhi mahadweep baad main vikhandit hone or pravaahit hokar apane vartmaan sthanon par pahunchne se pehle ek samay main ek vishaal mahadweep kaa hissaa the jise unhone "uracontinent" kaha tha
 The term Pangea came to light in 1928 during a symposium held to discuss Alfred Wegener's theory
 ek vishaal mahaasaagar jo panzia ko chaaron ore se ghere hue tha, tadnusaar uskaa naam panthalasa rakhaa gaya
 It seems that the fragmentation and origin of the vast continents is consecutive in the history of the Earth's 4
6 billion years
 panzia se pehle kai anya nirmaan bhi hue ho sakate hai
 Last to second, Panotia was formed 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic Eoin and existed until 540 ma
 panotia se pehle rodenia astitv main tha jo lagbhag 1
1 billian varshon pehle se lekar 750 million varshon pehle tak maujuud rahaa tha
 Rhodinia was formed by the deposition and joining of fragments resulting from the fragmentation of an old massive continent called Columbia or Nuna, built in the period 2
0–1
8 GA
 rodenia ke sateek vinyas or jeeyodynamiks itihaas ko utani behatar tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he jitna panotia or panzia ko
jab rodenia kaa vikhandan hua to yah teen tukdon main bant gaya: proto-loresia kaa vishaal mahadweep, proto-gondvanaa kaa vishaal mahadweep or apekshaakrit chota congou creton
 proto-loresia or proto-gondvanaland ko proto-tethis mahaasaagar ne alag-alag kar diya tha
 Laurentia, Siberia and the Baltic continents were formed soon after proto-laurentia itself split and separated
 isaki daraar se do nae mahasaagaron, ipitas mahaasaagar or pelioasian mahaasaagar kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 The Baltic was located east of Laurentia and north-east of Siberia Laurentia
 600 eme ke aasapaas in mahasaagaron main se zyaadaatar ne waapas ek saath milakar ek apekshaakrit alpaayu vishaal mahadweep panotia kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen dhruvon ke paas badi maatra main jameen or bumadhya rekha ke paas dhruviya mahasaagaron ko jodne vaali sirf ek apekshaakrit choti pattee shaamil thi
 Only 6040 years after its origin, about 540 ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian era Panotia disintegrated, giving rise to the southern continent of Laurentia, the Baltic, and Gondwana
 cambrian kaal main laurenshia kaa swatantra mahadweep, jo uttari america bana, yah teen ore se ghire simaankit mahasaagaron ke saath bumadhya rekha par sthit ho gaya: uttar or pashchim main panthalasik mahaasaagar, dakshin main ipitas mahaasaagar or purv main khantee mahaasaagar
 pracheenatam ordovisian main 480 eme ke aasapaas evalonia kaa chota mahadweep, ek jameen kaa hissaa jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america, nova scotia or england bana, gondvanaa se mukt ho gaya or isane laurenshia kii ore apana safar shuru kar diya
 The Baltic, Laurentia, and Avalonia all united together by the end of the Ordovician period, thus forming a small continent near the Iapetus Ocean called Euramerica or Laurecia
 takkar ke parinaam swaroop uttari epalachiyans kii bhi utpatti hui
 siberia do mahadwipon ke bich khantee mahaasaagar ke saath uramerica ke nikat sthit ho gaya
 When all these incidents were happening, Gondwana slowly slipped towards the South Pole
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa pehla charan tha
 The second phase of Pangea's genesis was Euramerica's collision with Gondwana
 By the Silurian period, 440 MA, the Baltic had already collided with Laurentia to form Euramerica
 evalonia abhi tak laurenshia se nahin takaraayaa tha or unke bich ek samudri maarg, ipitas mahaasaagar kaa ek avshesh abhi tak sikud rahaa tha kyonki evalonia dhire-dhire laurenshia kii ore khisakane laga tha
 Meanwhile southern Europe fragmented from Gondwana and the newly formed rake began to move across the ocean towards Euramerica and collided with the southern Baltic in the Devonian, although this small continent was in the form of an underwater strip
 ipitas mahaasaagar kii shakha khantee mahaasaagar bhi siberia se ek dweepiya vrutt ke rup main sikud rahaa tha jo purvi baltic se takaraa gaya
 a new ocean, the Ural Ocean, was present behind this island
 silurian kaal ke ant main uttar or dakshin china gondvanaa se dur chale gaye or sikudte hue proto-tethis mahaasaagar ke paar uttar kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or iske dakshini sire par nayaa peleo-tethis mahaasaagar khul rahaa tha
 In the Devonian period, Gondwana itself started moving towards Euramerica, causing the Rake Ocean to shrink
 praarambhik carbonipheras yug main uttar-pashchim africa ne uramerica ke dakshin-purvi tat ko chhu liya tha jisase epalchian parvaton or messeta parvaton ke dakshini hisson kaa nirmaan hona shuru ho gaya tha
 South America moved northward towards southern Euramerica while the eastern parts of Gondwana started moving from the equator to the south pole

 The Cimmerian plate was still crossing the shrinking paleo-tethys which continued until the middle of the Jurassic period
 The paleo-tethys was closed from west to east, thus creating the Cimmerian Orogeny

 For example, fossils of therapsid Listerosaurus are found in South Africa, India and Australia, along with members of the Glossopteris flora that would have extended from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their current positions; Similarly, the freshwater reptile Mizosaurus is found only in the local areas of the coasts of Brazil and West Africa

 The magnetic variations between sample groups that have a difference of millions of years in age are due to a combined real polarity deviation and movement of continents

 harith arthvyavasthaario+20 se purv harith arthvyavastha se sambhddha vishay ne vyapak taur par dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 Developing countries believe that the process of defining the global development path based on sustainable development and its three pillars, namely economic, social and environmental, defined by the Rio Principles should continue
 unki samaj main harith arthvyavastha ko is vyapak ruparekha ke saath sahyojit mana gaya he tathaa harith vikaas par karrwai tabhi praapt kii ja sakati he jab vikasshil deshon ko vitt, praudyogiki evam kshamta nirmaan kii disha main sahaayta pradaan karte hue samarthakaari tantra uplabdh karaayaa jaae
 He further believes that the 'green economy' as a framework will succeed only if it enhances the capabilities to address the problem of poverty alleviation, takes policy measures for national conditions and priorities and ensures that it will result in The structural changes should not lead to green protectionism and undesirable conditions
 harith arthvyavastha ke sambandh main bharat kaa najariya anivaaryat: garibi unmoolan, khaadya suraksha, aadhunik urja sevaaon tak rojgaar srijan jaisi taatkaalik praathamiktaaon se sambandhit he
 India believes that the 'green Economy' is a dynamic ideology that aims to promote activities towards poverty alleviation in a sustained manner, thus giving the economy a green look in order of economic, social and environmental development
 bharat kaa maananaa he ki 'harith arthvyavastha' par kisi bhi prakaar kii samaj se purv samaan parantu saajhe or bhinn dayitvon ke siddhant par nishchit rup se dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 It also sees Rio + 20 as an opportunity to bring sustainable development to the center of the global development agenda
 harith arthvyavastha kii vichaardhaara ke antargat vibhinn deshon kii vibhinn kshamtaaon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhaa janaa chahie
 The rush to conceptualize the green model could create a new international standard for development, which may invalidate other types of development models
 isamen vikaas kaa vah model bhi shaamil ho saktaa he, jiskaa anupaalan bharat jaise anek desh apane saamaajik-aarthik vikaas evam garibi upshman ke liye karte rahe hai
 Poverty is the biggest polluter, as Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said in 1972 in Stockholm
 kuch logon ne yah bhi kaha he ki harith modelon kii vakaalat ko rekhaankit karne vaale pratimaanon main badlaav laana ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon ke upar viksit deshon ke aarthik laabhon ko banaae rakhane kaa ek prayaas bhi ho saktaa he jo anek kshetron main aaj viksit deshon kii barabari karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 In line with the capacity and development imperatives, certain resilience related to the fundamental goal of sustainable development for each country has not been in line with the new global standard model, raising questions on our own development path as resource scarcity still prevails in developing countries is
 logon kii aajeevika ko banaae rakhana bhi samaan rup se mahatvapurn he
 The indispensable goals of social, economic development and poverty alleviation in developing countries cannot be made secondary by setting new standards of development

 It is also important that the natural resources of the country are also discussed in the discussions on the green economy
 satat vikaas lakshya rio+20 ke parinaamon ke bhaag ke rup main satat vikaas lakshyon ko sambhavit delibrable ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 Proposals for both quantitative and qualitative targets have been proposed under various chapters of the Johannesburg Implementation Plan
 uplabdh samay ko dhyaan main rakhte hue prastaav kiya ja rahaa he ki rio+20 ke dauraan esadiji par charchaa ho or ise angikaar kiye jane kii baad kii taarikh nirdhaarit karne ke liye ek prakriya shuru kii jaae jo varsh 2015 ke baad bhi jari rahe
 India does not support the determination of any quantitative targets that would hinder the path of economic development without the provision of implementation modalities in developing countries
 iske atirikt rio+20 main satat vikaas se sambhddha kisi karyanvayan aadhaarit nishkarsh main saajhe parantu bhinn dayitvon kaa avashya dhyaan rakhaa jaae
 The mdgs particularly focused on the implementation processes of developing countries, but the sdgs should not only be for everyone but developed countries should first come forward to meet the goals as per CBRD principles
 satat vikaas ke liye sansthagat ruparekhasatat vikaas ko badhaava dene ke liye vaishvik sansthagat ruparekha ko sudrudh banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Various countries believe that the presence of a sustainable development framework fragmented under the United Nations system and the need for better coordination and reconciliation in many multilateral environmental agreements
 satat vikaas se sambhddha vartmaan ayog ko satat vikaas parishad main parivartit karne athwa yuanipi ko ek chhatra antarrashtriya sanghathan ke rup main unnayit karne or / athwa ichosos tathaa / athwa ke antargat ek ucchstareey rajnatik manch kaa srijan karne jaise anek vichaaron par charchaa kii ja rahi he, jiskaa uddeshy satat vikaas ko ucchstareey rajnatik drishyata pradaan karnaa he
 Most developing countries believe that the question of IFSD should be viewed with special reference to strike a balance between its economic, social and environmental dimensions, while addressing the needs and constraints of developing countries, particularly enabling and subsidized financial and technological resources
 Special emphasis should also be placed on assistance in transfer and capacity building

 The most common type of driver is a light diaphragm or cone
 a rigid basket or frame is attached to a flexible suspension by which a coil of fine wire moves axially in a cylindrical magnetic field
 jab ek vidyut sanket wais kundali main bheja jaataa he, to wais kundali main vidyut dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey kshetra utpann hota he, jo ise ek chal vidyut chumbak bana detaa he
 The interaction between the coil and the driver's magnetic system produces a mechanical force that causes the coil to move back and forth, resulting in the reproduction of the sound under the control of the electrical signal from the amplifier
 laudspikar ke is prakaar ke vyaktigat ghatakon kaa varnan nimnlikhit prakaar he
 The diaphragm is usually produced in a conical or domed configuration
 vividh prakaar kii saamagree kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, lekin sabase aam, kaagaj, plastic or dhaatu hai
 The ideal material for this is one that is 1) rigid, to prevent uncontrolled motion of the cone; 2) Reduce weight, so that the minimum initial force requirement and energy storage issues are minimized, 3) well deformed, so that the signal does not continue to vibrate due to the resonance frequency set by its use and audible echo Don't be In practice, the use of current material cannot fulfill all three criteria simultaneously; Hence there are dilemmas in the design of the driver

 Multiple drivers typically perform beyond that range by combining them across an entire loudspeaker system
 ek purna-seemaa driver ko yathasambhav vyapak aavriti anukriya ke liye dizin kiya jaataa he
 These drivers are small, typically 3 to 8 inches in diameter, designed to provide reasonably high frequency response and carefully designed for low-distortion output at low frequencies, although their maximum output level is reduced
 purna-seemaa driver sarvaadhik aam rup se jan udghoshnaa systamon par, televijan par, chote radio, intercom, kuch computer spikaron main sune jate hai
 The use of wide range drive units in hi-fi speaker systems can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers due to incompatible driver conditions or transition network issues

 Opponents typically require large, wide, expensive enclosures — such as transmission lines or horns — to reach their optimal performance, along with limited-frequency response and minor output capabilities of wide-range drivers
 purna-seemaa driveron main aksar vijar naamak ek atirikt shanku lagaaya jaataa he, jo ek chota, halkaa vaak kundali tathaa praathmik shanku ke bich jod se judaa hota he
 The whizzer cone provides the driver's high frequency response and extends its high frequency directivity, otherwise it becomes extremely narrower due to the external diameter cone material not able to keep in sync with the central speech coil at high frequencies

 nateeja yah hota he ki mukhya shanku kam aavritiyaan vitarit karata he vijar shanku adhiktar ucch aavritiyon main yogadan detaa he
 Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, the output immersion at higher frequencies is better relative to a single large diaphragm
 simit-duuri ke driveron kaa istemaal bhi akele, aamtaur par computer, khilone or ghadi radio main kiya jaataa he
 These drivers are less elaborate and less expensive than wide-range drivers, and they will have to make many compromises in order to fit into very small spaces
 In these applications, sound quality has a lower priority

 a mid-range speaker is a loudspeaker driver that produces mid-frequencies
 madhya duuri driver diaphram kaagaj yaa mishrit saamagree se banaaya ja saktaa he or pratyaksh vikiran driver ho sakate hai
 Or they can be compression drivers
 If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be installed on a loudspeaker enclosure in front of the enclosure, or if there is a compression driver, to be installed on the neck of the horn to control the extra output level and radiation pattern
 Can

 a passive crossover is an electronic circuit using one or more resistor, inductive or non-polar capacitor combinations
 ye bhaag dhyanpurvak dizin kiye gaye network main gathit kiye gaye hai or pravardhak ke sanketon ko alag-alag driveron ko vitarit karne se purv aavashyak aavriti band main vibhajit karne ke liye inhen adhiktar vidyut pravardhak tathaa laudspikar driveron ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 The passive crossover circuit itself does not require any external electric power beyond the audio signal but there is a significant reduction in the damping coefficient between the speech call and the crossover

 Passive filters can also be used in this way before power amplification, but this is an unusual solution due to the persistence compared to active filtering

 In car audio systems, passive crossover may be required in a separate box, adjusting the size of the components used
 Passive crossover may be common for low-level filtering, or complex to provide steep slopes of 18 to 24 db per octave
 Passive crossovers can be designed to accommodate undesired characteristics of driver, geopolymer or enclosure resonance and may make implementation difficult due to components interactions

 Most loudspeaker systems have drivers mounted in the enclosure or a cabinet, mounted in an enclosure consisting of drivers
 The role of the enclosure is to provide a place for the drivers to physically mount and to prevent destructive interference with the sound waves emanating from the front of the driver's back; These usually result in significant levels and quality changes at cancellations and low frequencies
 saralatam driver arohan ek sapaat panel hota he, jiske chhidron main driver arohit hote hai
 However, in this method, sound frequencies of longer wavelength than the amplitude of the resist are canceled out, because the transverse radiation from the back of the cone interferes with the radiation from the obverse

 This action can be performed from a sufficiently large sealed box
 chunki anant aayam ke panel avyaavhaarik hai, adhiktar antahkshetra gatisheel diafram se prishth vikiran ko samit karke kaary karte hai
 a sealed enclosure prevents transmission of sound emitted from the back of the loudspeaker by limiting the sound to a rigid and airtight box

 Other types of enclosure convert sound radiation so that it is creatively added to the output produced from the front of the cone
 aisa karne vaale diginon kaa upyog praayah prabhavi nune-aavriti anukriya kaa vistaar karne or driver kaa nune-aavriti nirgam badhaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 To make the transition between drivers as seamless as possible, by shifting forward or backward to one or more driver's mounting points so that each driver's acoustic center stays in the same vertical plane, system designers attempt to time-align the drivers

 The result is a load resistance that varies quite widely with frequency and usually also has a variable phase relationship between a voltage and an electric current, which also varies with frequency

 To produce sound, a loudspeaker is driven by a modulated electric current, which passes through a "speaker coil", which then magnetizes the coil, creating a magnetic field

 For example, the output of a woofer driver decreases when the input frequency decreases due to the increasing poor matching between air and driver
 die hue nivesh ke liye espel ke aadhaar par driver anumatank ko samvedansheeltaa anumatank kaha jaataa he or saidhantik rup se yah dakshata ke samaan hai
 Sensitivity is generally defined as the number of decibels at 1 w electrical input, often measured at 1 meter at a single frequency
 The voltage used is often 2
83 VRMS, which is 1 watt at 8Ω speaker impedance
 Measurements taken with this reference are quoted as db at 2
83 v @ 1 m
 dhwani dabaav nirgam laudspikar se ek meter par tathaa aksh par mapa jaataa he, ki shart ke tahat ki laudspikar ek aseem badi jagah main ek aseem avarohak par arohit hokar vikirit ho rahaa he
 Obviously then, sensitivity is not directly correlated with efficiency, as it also depends on the directivity of the driver being tested and the acoustic environment in front of the actual loudspeaker

 The horn also improves impedance matching between speech and air, producing more acoustic power than a given speaker power
 kuch maamalon main, behatar pratibaadha milan spikar ko adhik dhvanik shakti kaa utpaadan karne kii anumati degaa
 It is not necessary that a driver with high maximum power titer may not necessarily be driven at a faster level than a low-rated speaker, as sensitivity and power management are largely independent properties
 aagle udaahranon main, maanalen ki tulana kiye ja rahe donon driveron kii vidyut pratibaadha samaan he; donon samaan aavriti par apane-apane paas band par sanchalit hai; or shakti sampeedan tathaa virupan kam hai
 For the first example, one speaker is 3 db more sensitive than the other, producing two times the sound power for the same power input, thus, 92 db for a 100 watt driver titer @ 1 m sensitivity for a 200 watt tether driver
 1 watt @ 1 meter will generate twice the acoustic power compared to 89 db, while the current is run at a uniform 100 watt investment
 is vishisht udhaaharan main, jab 100 wat par sanchalit he, spikar e utana hi SPL yaa tivrata kaa utpaadan karegaa, jitna spikar bi 200 wat nivesh ke saath utpaadan karata he
 Thus, a 3 db increase in sensitivity of a speaker means that it will require half the amplifier power to achieve the given SPL
 This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier and often, lower overall system cost

 When designing a speaker system, only two out of three standards can be selected

 is anguuthe ke niyam ko kabhi-kabhi hollman kaa louh niyam The interaction of a loudspeaker system with its environment is complex and largely beyond the control of the loudspeaker designer
 adhikansh shravan kaksh aakaar, rup, khand or saaj-saamaan ke aadhaar par ek newnaadhik chintansheel vaataavaran prastut karte hai
 This means that the sound that reaches the ears of a listener is not only the sound coming directly from the speaker system, but the same sound travels through one or more surfaces and reaches late
 ye parilakshith dhwani tarangen, jab pratyaksh dhwani se judati hai to chaynit aavritiyon par nirasan tathaa yojan hote hai, is prakaar shrota ke kaan main dhwani ke lay or charitra badale hue pahunchate hai
 The human brain is very sensitive to small changes, including some of these, and this is part of the reason why loudspeaker systems give different sounds in different listening conditions or in different rooms
 ek laudspikar system kii aawaaj main ek mahatvapurn kaarak vaataavaran main maujuud prasar or avasorana kii raashi he
 The clap in a typical empty room without a hand, curtains or carpets, produces a sharp echo, which is both due to lack of absorption and maintenance from flat walls, floors and ceilings
 kathor sataha vaale furniture, diwaar ke parde, aalmaariyaan, ati alankrita plaster se chat kii sajaavat pratidhwani ko badal detii he, mukhyatah dhwani tarangadairghy ke aakaar se milti kuch had tak paravarti vastuon ke dwaara utpann visaran ke kaaran aisa hota he
 This to some extent breaks the reflection caused by otherwise naked flat surfaces and propagates the reflected energy of the incident wave to a larger reflection angle
 ek vishisht ytaakar shravan kaksh, deevaaron, farsh or chat kii kathor samanaantar satahon ke kaaran teenon ayaamon, baayen-daaen, upar-neeche tathaa aage-peeche main praathmik anunaad node hote hai
 In addition, there are complex resonance states with three, four, five and even six boundary surfaces in which all surfaces combine to form backward waves
 in avasthaaon ko kam aavritiyaan sarvaadhik uttejit karti hai, kyonki lambey tarangadairghy furniture sanyojanon yaa sthanan se adhik prabhavit nahin hote
 visheshkar chote or madhyamaakar kamare jaise recording studio, home theatre or prasaaran studio main mod antaraal atyant mahatvapurn he
 The proximity of the loudspeakers to the room boundaries affects how strongly the resonances are stimulated, as well as the relative power at each frequency
 shrota kaa sthaan bhi mahatvapurn he, jaise ki ek seemaa ke nikat ek sthaan par aavritiyon ke kathith santulan par ek bada prabhaav ho saktaa he
 This is because the backward wave patterns are most easily heard in these locations and at lower frequencies, below the Schroeder frequency - typically around 200–300 Hz, depending on the size of the room
 dhwani visheshgyon ne, dhwani sroton ke vikiran kaa adhyayan karne main kuch samajhane ke liye mahatvapurn avadharanaon kaa vikaas kiya he ki kaise laudspikaron ko samajha jaataa he
 The simplest possible radiation source is a point source, sometimes called a simple source
 ek adarsh bindu strot ek ati sookshm dhwani vikirankaari sookshm bindu he
 It may be easy to imagine a small vibrating sphere, whose diameter decreases and increases uniformly, sending sound waves uniformly in all directions, free of frequency
 ek laudspikar system sahit, kisi bhi dhwani utpaadak vastu, ke aise hi saadhaaran binduon ke sangyojan se bane hone ke bare main sochaa ja saktaa he
 The radiation pattern of a combination of point sources will not be similar to a single source, but will depend on the distance and orientation between sources, the relative position from which the listener listens and the frequency of the referenced sound
 By using geometry and calculus, some simple combinations of sources can be solved easily, others do not
 ek saadhaaran sangyojan he, do saral strot ek duuri ke dwaara alag he or pravastha-bahya kampan kar rahe hai, ek sookshm gole kaa vistaar hota he, to duusare kaa sankuchan
 is jodi ko ek dwik yaa dwidhruv ke rup main janaa jaataa he or is sangyojan ke vikiran ek bahut chote se ek bina avarohak ke gatisheel laudspikar ke sanchaalan ke samaan he
 The direction of a dipole is 8 points in size, and the maximum output is with a vector connecting the two sources and toward the minimum side when the observation point is equidistant from both sources, where positive and negative waves cancel a spur
 jabaki adhikansh driver dwidhruv hai, jis antahkshetra se ve jude hai uske aadhaar par, ve ekaladhruv yaa dwidhruv kii tarah vikiran kar sakate hai
 If mounted on a finite resistor and these phase-out waves are allowed to interact, the dipole frequency response results in a vertex and a zero
 jab prishth vikiran ko avashoshit yaa ek box main roak liya jaataa he, diafram ek ekadhruviya vikirak ho jaataa he
 Bipolar speakers are a method of deriving omnidirectional radiation patterns created by phase-mounting monolithic to opposite sides of a box
 vaastavik jivan main, alag-alag driver vastav main jatil shanku or gumbadon ke rup main 3di aakaar hai or inhen vibhinn kaarnon se badhika par rakhaa jaataa he
 a mathematical expression for the directivity of a complex shape, based on a modeled combination of point sources, usually not possible but the directivity of a loudspeaker with a spherical diaphragm is similar to that of a flat spherical piston, so it is discussed Can be used as a simplified example
 shaamil ganitiya bhautikee ke ek saral udhaaharan, nimnlikhit par vichaar kiijie:ek anant badhika par ek golakaar piston kii durakshetra dishikata ke liye sutara p = p 0 j 1 k a sin ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle p={ \ frac {p_{0}j_{1}}{k_{a} \ sin \ theta }}} haijahaan k a = 2 π a λ { \ displaystyle k_{a}={ \ frac {2 \ pi a}{ \ lambda }}}, p 0 { \ displaystyle p_{0}} aksh par dabaav he, a { \ displaystyle a} trigya he piston, λ { \ displaystyle \ lambda } arthath tarangadairghy he θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } aksh kone he or j 1 { \ displaystyle J_{1}} pratham prakaar kaa basal falan he
 a plane source will radiate the same sound for equally low frequencies whose wavelengths are longer than the dimensions of the plane source and as the frequency increases the sound from such a source will be concentrated in an increasing narrower angle
 
 The smaller the driver, the higher the frequency where this contraction of directivity occurs
 yahaan tak ki agar diafram bilkul golakaar nahin he, yah prabhaav is prakaar hota he ki bade strot adhik dishik he
 Many loudspeaker designs have been made which have almost the same behavior
 adhiktar sthiravaidyut yaa chumbakeey samtal dizin hai
 Different manufacturers use different driver mounting arrangements to create a specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed, to create a specific sound type in the space for which they are designed
 The resulting radiation pattern may be intended to closely simulate the sound produced by real instruments, or to create a controlled energy distribution just from the input signal
 An earlier example is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1 / 8 sphere
 The design of such a system was patented by Professor Amar Bose-2201 and actually produced commercially
 baad main bose modelon main jaan-boojhkar vaataavaran kii parvaah kiye bina laudspikar dwaara swayan sidhe yaa paravartit dhwani ke utpaadan par jor diya gaya
 These designs have been controversial in high-fidelity circles, but have proved commercially successful
 kai anya nirmaataaon ke dizin samaan siddhanton kaa paalan karte hai
 Directivity is an important issue because it affects the frequency balance of the sound the listener listens to, as well as the speaker system's interaction with the room and its accessories
 ek spikar jo bahut hi dishik he kaa parinaam ucch aavriti rahit ek anuranan kshetra main ho saktaa he, jo yah prabhaav de ki yadhyapi isaki aksh par maap sahi he, kintu isamen trable nahin he
 Increasing directivity at very wide or high frequencies can give the impression that the treble is too high, or too low
 This is part of the reason why the full characteristic of the sound of a loudspeaker given the response measurement on the axis is not described
 anya driver jo sabase adhik istemaal kiye jane vaale sidhe vikirankaari, antahkshetra main arohit vidyut-gatisheel driver se alag hat kar hai un main shaamil hai- Shring loudspeakers are the oldest form of loudspeaker system
 vaak pravardhak megaphone main shring kaa upyog kam se kam 17veen shatabdi jitna purana he or yantric gramophone main shring kaa upyog sabase pehle 1857 main hota tha
 Ring loudspeakers designed in front of or behind the horn loudspeaker driver are used to increase the loudspeaker directionality and for small diameter conversion, high pressure position on the long diameter driver cone surface and low pressure position on the horn face
 is se laudspikar kii samvedansheeltaa bad jaati he or dhwani ek parimit kshetra main kendrit ho jaati he
 With neck size, mouth, horn length, as well as area expansion rate, it should be noted that matching drives should be carefully selected to provide conversion functions across a range of frequencies
 The length required to make a bass and the transverse mouth area or sub-bass horn is required to be several feet long
 'vulture rings' can reduce the overall size but force designers to compromise and accept increased complexity such as cost and construction
 kuch shring dizin na keval kam aavriti shrung ko valit karata he lekin, kamare ke kone main diwaar kaa upyog shring mukh ke vistaar ke rup main karte hai
 In the late 1940s, Shringas, whose faces occupied much of the room's wall, were no longer unknown among hi-fi fans
 Room-size installations were much less acceptable when two or more were needed

 This is a hundredfold increase in output compared to a declared sensitivity of 90 db, where higher sound levels are required, or contain amplification power, it is priceless

 Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over traditional loudspeakers: they are overload resistors that typically destroy most high frequency drivers and can be used without a crossover due to their electrical properties
 vahiin nuksaan bhi hai: kuch pravardhak thartharaana sakate hai jaise adhikansh pijovidhyut, jiske parinamswaroop virupan yaa pravardhak ko kshati ho saktaa he
 Additionally, their frequency response is, in most cases, lighter than other technologies
 yahi kaaran he ki inkaa aam taur par ekal aavriti yaa gaiyr-mahatvapurn anuprayogon main upyog kiya jaataa he
 Piezoelectric speakers can have extended high frequency outputs, this is useful for certain situations: for example sonar applications that have piezoelectric adaptations as output devices and input devices
 These applications have their advantages, not even simple, solid state construction that can resist the effects of seawater better than ribbon-based devices

 Magnetic distortion speaker drivers have some special advantages: they can provide more force than other techniques, short excursions can prevent distortions from large excursions in other designs; The magnetization coil is stable and can therefore be cooled more easily, as they are stronger, do not require a delicate suspension and a walk coil
 chumbakeey virupan spikar modul phostakes or fionic dwaara nirmit kiya gaya he tathaa sabavufar driveron kaa bhi utpaadan kiya gaya he

 chunki ve ek choti vaak kundali kii bajaay puri jhilli kii sataha par se sanchalit hote hai, ve aamtaur par gatisheel driveron kii tulana main ek adhik raikhik or kam virupan gati pradaan karte hai
 Their disadvantage is that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited due to practical construction limitations, the stator is positioned forward, requiring higher voltages to achieve acceptable efficiency, which increases the tendency of the electric arc, as well as dust by the speaker
 The attracting of particles increases
 kai varsh tak sthiravaidyut laudspikaron kii pratishtha ek aamtaur par avishwasaneey or kabhi-kabhi khatarnaak utpaada ke rup main thi
 Arching remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt, or when operated with high signal levels

 Due to this reason and low excursion capacity, the full range electrostatic loudspeakers are larger in nature and the bass will roll at a frequency of wavelengths equal to one quarter of the narrowest panel amplitude
 To reduce the size of commercial products, they are sometimes used as a high frequency driver in combination with a conventional dynamic driver that handles bass frequencies
 ek riban spikar main ek patala dhaatu-film riban ek chumbakeey main nilambit hota he
 Electrical signals are sent to the ribbon, which moves along them, thus producing a sound

 The resistance of the ribbon is very low, which most amplifiers cannot directly operate the propellant
 As a result, a reducing transformer is typically used to increase the current through the ribbon

 These can then be made in a neutral color and hung on walls where they receive less attention than other speakers, or are deliberately painted patterns to act as embellishments
 Two problems with the flat panel technique are related: first, a flat panel is necessarily more flexible than a cone shape in the same material and will therefore move as a single unit and second, control of resonances in the panel is difficult, Due to which there is a possibility of considerable distortions
 aisi halki, drudh saamagree jaise styrofom kaa upyog karke kuch pragati kii gai he or kai flats panel system haal ke saalon main vanijyik rup se utpaadit kiye gaye hai
 The new implementation of the flat panel speaker system includes a deliberately placed flexible panel and a "stirrer", mounted far from the center and positioned so that the panel can be vibrated with minimal resonances
 Speakers using such technology can reproduce sound with broad directionality patterns and have been used in some computer speaker designs and in bookshelf loudspeakers

 Because it cannot always be said which genes are more likely to prove, the best option is the inertia of conservation
 It is possible to assure as many genes as possible
 For ecologists, this latter approach is sometimes considered too restrictive, as it is considered ecological

 In agriculture and animal husbandry, the use of the Green Revolution popularized traditional hybridization by making multiple layers to increase yield "high yielding varieties"
 The handful of plants and cattle breeds often hybridized in developed countries and hybridized with further localized varieties In the rest of the developing world, high-yielding strains were immune to local climates and diseases

due to complete disuse because of un-profitability and uncontrolled intentional and unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding ) formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution resulting in great loss in genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole
 A] is an organism whose gene tick content has been altered using this genetic engineering technique commonly known as recombinant DNA technology
 Genetically modified crops today are not only a common source for genetic contamination of wild varieties, But also other domesticated varieties have become relatively derived from natural hybridization
 It is being said that genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution is destroying that needed unique genetic base thereby creating an unforeseen hidden crisis which will result in a severe threat to our food security for the future when diverse genetic material will cease to exist to be able to further improve or hybridize weakening food crops and livestock against more resistant diseases and climatic changes

"aurangzeb did not expect this clever reply, but he was very pleased with this wise presence
 , The words Yadunath Sarkar has written about this 'title' in his Jaipur history - unquestionably - "the new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased
 with this youthful prince's feats before Khelna that he cried out, "you are more than a man, you are sawa- ie, a hundred and twenty five per cent hero ' kuch duusare strot batalaate hai 'savai' kii oopaadhi aurangzeb dwaara nahin balki badshaah farrukh sier dwaara inhen di gayi thi

 Jai Singh received this award for the six-year 'hard service' of the emperor! After this, when Shahzada Bidarbakht became the Subedar of Malve, he made him the Deputy Subedar there, respecting the services of Jaisingh, which Aurangzeb immediately 'disallowed' and wrote a decree that Ainda even a Hindu to a minor faujdar
 Neither should be made
 ' The irony is that Aurangzeb, who once honored him by calling him 'sawai', was later so annoyed and prejudiced that he issued this insulting command - "by not giving Jayasinha a seat on Masnad, laying on the ground below"

 Sahu was ready for this, but the Peshwa people were not much in favor of this agreement
 inhone deepasingh kumbhani ko sahu ke paas satara bheja
 While returning, Deep Singh also met the Nizam, but in September 1730, his agreement with Malwa was not resolved
 buddhasingh bundi or unki kushwahi rani ke aapas main gambhir matbhed paidaa hone par jaisingh ke sambandh bhi bundi naresh buddhasingh se bahut kharaab ho gayi
 In the end, the relations deteriorated so much that Jai Singh made the King of Bundi the king of Salim Singh Hada of Karwar in place of Buddha Singh, and called him the king, and later married his daughter

 He beheaded the killed chieftains and gave siropaav to their sons
