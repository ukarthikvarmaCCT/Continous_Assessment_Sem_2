 endoscope kaa arth he andar dekhnaa, or khaastaur par iskaa arth hota he chikitsiya kaaran se endoscope kii madad se sharir ke andar dekhnaa
 The endoscope is a device that is used to examine inside the hollow organs or perforations of the body
 anya chikitsiya chithran upkarnon ke vipareet endoscope ko sidhe hi sharir ke ang main daalaa jaataa he
 Endoscopy may also refer to the use of borescopes in technical situations in which direct line-of-sight observation is not practical
 ek endoscope nimnlikhit ghatakon se milakar bana ho saktaa he: Endoscopy may include: pehle endoscope kaa avishkaar, 1806 main philip bojini dwaara maanav sharir kii naliyon or garton kii jaanch ke liye unke dwaara prastut kiye gayi "lichatlitre " ke vikaas ke saath hua tha
 However the Vienna Medical Society disapproved of such curiosity
 1822 main maikinek island, michigan ke ek sainya shalya-chikitsak wiliam bumont dwaara pehla endoscope viksit kiya gaya
 The first major step towards improving endoscopy was the use of electric light in it
 aise shuruaati prakaash strot bahari the
 Later small bulbs became available that made it possible to obtain internal light, for example in a hysteroscope developed by Charles David in 1908
 hence chrishchiyan jacobiyas ko leparoscopy or thoracoscopy kii madad se amashay tathaa seene kii aarambhik endoscopy khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 Laparoscopy was used by Heinz Cock in the 1930s to diagnose liver and gall bladder

 In 1944, Roller Palmer placed his patients in the Trendelenburg position after gastric distention of the stomach and was thus able to reliably perform gynecologic laparoscopy
 karl stores ne ianti visheshgyon ke liye 1945 main upkaran banane shuru kiye
 His intention was to develop such a device with the help of which doctors could be able to see inside the human body
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke ant main uplabdh takanic ab bhi bahut hi saadhaaran thi
 The area under examination of the inner part of the human body was illuminated by the Miniature Electric Lamp
 is baat ke prayaas kiye gaye ki endoscopy tub ke jariye bahari strot se sharir ke andar prakaash ko paravartit kiya ja sake
 Karl Storge adopted a plan: he tried to put very bright, but cool, light through the device into the body, to get the best visibility inside the body, as well as to provide objective documentation through image transmission
 aane vaale samay ke liye maardarshak ke rup main apane 400 se adhik rogiyon or kaaryaksham namoonay ke saath karl stores ne endoscopy ke vikaas kii disha main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 However, it was Harold Hopkins who, along with his engineering talent and vision, eventually created a revolution in the field of medical optics through the work of an optical designer
 gastroscope ko pehali baar 1952 main ek japani doctor or optical ejiniyaron kii team dwaara viksit kiya gaya
 Mutsuo Sugiura, under the joint auspices of Olympus Corporation, worked with Doctor Tatsuro Yuji and his colleague Shoji Fukami to develop a device they had previously dubbed the "gastro Camera"
 isamen ek nanha-sa camera ek lacheele tip par lite balb ke saath judaa hua tha
 With this help, he was able to take pictures of stomach ulcers and detect stomach cancer in the initial stage, which were not caught by X-rays
 1950 ke dashak kii shuruaati daur main harold hopkins ne ek “fibroscope” kaa nirmaan kiya, jo chikitsa or udyog, donon hi kshetron main upyogi sabit hua
 Subsequent research and development on these fibers led to further improvement in picture quality
 aane vaale dinon main nae vikaas ke antargat shaamil hue ek shaktishaalee bahya strot se vastu ke chor tak prakaash ke pahunchane ke liye atirikt fibron kaa istemaal – jisase ucchstareey purna varnakram chamak kii prapti sambhav hui, jisaki aavashyaktaa chitra kii baarikiyon ko dekhne or rangeen photography ke liye hoti he
 This capability evolved with developments in the optical field, in which it was possible to "operate" the tip by the controls placed in the hands of the endoscopist, as well as to remotely operate the surgical instrument inside the endoscope
 Also new facilities were acquired
 yah us shalya-chikitsa kii shuruyaat thi, jise ham aaj kii-hole surgery ke naam se jaanate hai
 Fernando Elves Martins of Portugal invented the first fiber optics endoscope
 haalanki, fibroscope kii chitra gunvattta kii bhautik simaaen thim
 In modern terminology, a bundle of 50,000 fibers effectively gives a picture of only 50,000 pixels, apart from this the fiber changes due to frequent changes in usage and thus gradually reduces pixels
 antat itani kshati ho jaati he ki samooche bandal ko badalane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Hopkins felt that any next optical correction would require a different method
 purv ke sakht endoscope main kaaphi kam lite transmittence tathaa kamjor image quality kii samasya thi
 There was no specific scope for imaging optics due to the need for surgical tools for surgical operations and the need for the illumination system to pass through the endoscope tube
 paaramparik pranali ke chote lens ko sahaayak ring kii jarurat thi, jo lens ke ek bade bhaag ko adhigrahit karata tha; jinhen nirmit karnaa or ek saath rakhana kaaphi kathin tha, saath hi optical rup se ve naakaam bhi the
 The sophisticated diagnosis that Hopkins presented was to fill the space between the 'little lens' with a glass rod
 ye thik-thik endoscope tub main feet ho jate the, jisase ve swa-sanrekhi ban gaye tathaa unhen ‘little lens’ ko puri tarah se vitarit karne ke liye kisi samarthan kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahi
 The rod-lens was easy to operate and use and used the maximum available diameter
 sahi vakrata, rod ke siron par coating tathaa kaanch ke prakaar ke adhiktam vikalpon, jo hopkins dwaara aanklit tathaa ullekith the, ke saath chitra kii gunvattta ko 1 mimi vyas vaali nalee main roopantarit kar diya gaya
 With such a small diameter high quality 'telescope' the tool and illuminance system could easily be placed inside an outer tube
 ek baar phir karl stores ne hi do vyaktiyon ke bich ke lambey rachanaatmak sahyog ke rup main pehle-pahal in nae endoscopon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Although there are certain areas of the body that will forever require flexible endoscopes, hard rod-lens endoscopes have such exceptional performance that they are still a favorite instrument in modern times, and indeed modern key-hole surgery

 Due to the use of sedative, most hospitals instruct patients to go home with another person and instruct them not to drive the vehicle themselves and handle other machinery on that day
 capsyul endoscopy The application of the robotic system led to the introduction of telesurgery, in which the surgeon can perform surgery by sitting in a place without touching the patient

 kisi ek bhugolic kshetra ke logon dwaara kisi duusare bhugolic kshetra main upnivesh sthapit karnaa or yah manyata rakhana ki yah ek acha kaam he, upniveshwaad kehalaata he
 The period of colonialism was often in the history from the fifteenth century to the twentieth century
 is kaal main europe ke logon ne vishwa ke vibhinn bhaagon main upnivesh banaaye
 The main reasons for the belief in colonialism during this period were - kuch upniveshi yah bhi sochate the ki sthaneey logon ko isaai banaakar tathaa unhen "sabhyataa" kaa darshan karakar ve unki sahaayta kar rahe hai
 But in reality, colonialism meant - hegemony, displacement and death
 upnivesh, matrudesh ke samrajya kaa bhaag hota tha; at: upniveshwaad kaa samrajyavad se ghanishtha sambandh he
 After the Turks took over Kustuntunia in 1453 AD, Europe's trade with the Asian countries by land route stopped
 atah apane vyapaar ko nirbaadh rup se chalaane hetu naye samudri margon kii khoj prarambh hui

 The multiplicity of wealth and the rise of independent states gave a boost to industries
 kai naveen udyog shuru hue
 Spain received the key to such a wealth of America that it reached the climax of prosperity
 isai-dharm-prachaarak bhi dharm prachaar hetu naye khoje hue deshon main jane lage
 In this way, European countries moved towards the establishment of colonies in order to serve their business interests and propagate, and thus colonization began in Europe
 upniveshwaad kaa arth he - kisi samrudh evam shaktishaalee raashtra dwaara apane vibhinn hiton ko saadhane ke liye kisi nirbal kintu prakritik sansadhano se paripurna raashtra ke vibhinn sansadhano kaa shakti ke bal par upbhog karnaa
 In colonialism, the people of the colonies are ruled by a foreign nation, they have no political authority in governance
 arganski ke anusaar, In fact, we can call colonialism the exploitation of a weak nation by vested interests by a powerful nation
 latin bhashaa ke shabd 'colonia' kaa matlab he ek aisi jaaydaad jise yojanabaddh dhang se videshiyon ke bich kaayam kiya gaya ho
 Such colonization was a common phenomenon in the Mediterranean region and medieval Europe
 iskaa udhaaharan madhyayug or aadhunik yug kii shuruaati avadhi main england kii hukumat dwaara wales or ireland ko upnivesh banane ke rup main diya jaataa he
 However, the modern colonialism that is being discussed here means the non-western cultures and nations by the European and American forces forcibly taking over the reigns, administration, environment, ecology, language, religion, system and life- The long-term process of imposing its heterogeneous values and structures on style
 is tarah ke upniveshwaad kaa ek strot columbus or vascodigama kii yatraaon ko bhi mana jaataa he
 Historians of colonialism have identified the development of the phenomenon of imperial expansion by the fifteenth century European powers as colonialism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
 audyogic kranti se paidaa hue halaat ne upniveshvaadi dohan ko apane charam par pahunchaaya
 This trend lasted until the middle of the twentieth century when a wave of national liberation struggles and revolutions under the process of de-colonization brought it to an end
 is parighatna kii vaicharik jaden vanikwaadi poonjeewaad ke vistaar or uske saath-saath viksit hui udaarataavaadi vyaktvaad kii vichaardhaara main dekhi ja sakati hai
 The same kind of basic tendencies are inherent in colonizing another land and starving individualism
 naslwad, eurokendriyata or videshi-dwesh jaisi vikrutiyaan upniveshwaad kii hi dein hai
 Colonialism notwithstanding imperialism, there are quite a few mutually and interdependent positions
 samrajyavad ke liye zaruri nahin he ki kisi desh par kabza kiya jaae or vahaan kabza karne vaale apane logon ko bhej kar apana prashasan kaayam karen
 Without it, relations of subordination to the imperialist center can be maintained
 par, upniveshwaad ke liye zaruri he ki vijit desh main apni colony basaai jaae, aakraamak kii vijiton bahusankhya pratyaksh ke zariye khud ko shreshth maanate hue apane kanoon or faisale aropit karen
 In order to do this, imperialist expansion was required to achieve the logic of a particular ideology
 yah bhoomika satrahavin sadi main pratipaadit jon lock ke darshan ne nibhaai
 Locke's arguments contained arguments to justify the actions taken by Britain's occupiers to occupy American soil
 unki rachana 'tu treetaise on civil government' kii duusari thisis ‘prakrut avasthaa’ main vyakti dwaara apane adhikaron kii daavedaari ke bare main he
 They justify establishing civil rule in such places and developing the property acquired for personal gain through personal efforts
 yahi thisis aage chal kar dharti ke asmaan swaamitv ko uchit maanane kaa aadhaar bani
 Locke was of the opinion that the land in America is lying idle and the native people there are deprived of the ability to make good use of this earth
 lock ne hisaab lagaaya ki europe kii ek acre zamin agar apane swami ko paanch shilling prati varsh kaa munaafaa detii he, to uske mukaable america kii zamin se us par based indian ko hone vaala kul munaafaa ek penny se bhi bahut kam he
 Since American Indians have failed to adopt the wealth-based exchange system prevalent in the rest of humanity, human rights must be acquired and invested in their land according to the 'right to property'
 lock kii isi thisis main asian or america mahadweep kii sabhyataa or samskruti par europee shreshthata kii granthi ke beej the jiske aadhaar par aage chal kar upniveshvaadi sanrachanaon kaa shiraja khadaa kiya gaya
 The colonies were mainly of two varieties
 ek taraf america, austrailia or newjiland jaise the jinaki jalwaayu europiyanon ke liye suvidhajanak thi
 In these areas, white skin people were settled on a large scale
 unhone vahaan kii sthaneey aabaadi ke sanhaar or daman kii bheeshan pariyojnaayen chalaa kar vahaan na keval puri tarah apana kabza jamaa liya, balki ve desh unke apane ‘swadesh’ main badal gayi
 He saved the indigenous people from the massacre and pushed them into isolated areas
 duusari taraf ve upnivesh the jinka hawa-pani europiyanon ke liye pratikul tha 
 After occupying these countries, Europeans settled in small numbers and mainly used those weapons for economic exploitation and exploitation
 new england sareekhe thode-bahut aise upnivesh bhi the jinaki sthapana europea isaayiyon ne dharmik azaadi kii khoj main kii
 Geographical discoveries played an important role in the business revolution
 in bhugolic khojon ke saath hi upniveshwaad kaa aarambh hua
 European countries like Spain, Portugal, Dutch, France and England established colonies in remote countries
 europe main upniveshwaad ke aarambh ke nimnlikhit kaaran the - The discovery of America by Columbus as a result of geographical discoveries triggered competition for the collection of precious metals such as gold in European countries
 swarna-sangrah kii pratisparddha kii sthiti yah thi ki samast europe main ‘adhik swarna, adhik samruddhi, adhik kirti’ kaa naaraa buland hua
 Now the main focus of all European nations was on gold, fame and God i
e
 Gold, Glory and God
 upniveshon kii sthapana se europea deshon ko sona bhi mila, kirti bhi faili evam dharm kaa prachaar bhi hua
 Hence the Triple g policy was undoubtedly a reason for the establishment of colonies
 vyapaarik samruddhi ke falswaroop europea deshon main kai udyogon kii sthapana hui
 Europe lacked the raw materials required for these industries
 atah europea deshon ne kachche maal kii prapti hetu prakritik sansadhano evam africa evam asin deshon main upniveshon kii sthapana kii
 Due to the establishment of industries and availability of raw materials, industrial production grew at a rapid pace
 chunki is samay sabhi europea desh aarthik sangrakshan kii niti par chal rahe the
 Therefore, colonies were also established to conserve this manufactured goods
 arthath prayek upniveshon ko shaktishaalee rashtron dwaara jabaran nirmit maal kii kharid v kachche maal ke niryaat hetu baadhya kiya gaya
 Industrialization in various countries of Europe resulted in a large increase in the population of cities
 kalantar main atishesh jansankhya ko basaane ke liye bhi upniveshon kii sthapana ko bal mila
 The Europeans gained knowledge of many new things as a result of business progress and contact with new countries, they came to know about potato, tobacco, corn etc
 through contact with eastern countries
 garm masaale, chini, coffee, chaaval aadi ke bhi ab ve aadi ho gayi the
 Due to adverse climate it was not possible to grow all these things in European countries
 atah europea visheshgy angrej chaahate the ki unhen aise pradesh praapt ho jaayen jahaan inaki kheti kii ja sake
 Therefore, the ideology of colonization in places with favorable climate got a boost
 bhugolic khojon ke parinamswaroop praarambhik upnivesh portugal evam spain ne sthapit kiye
 This increased their prosperity
 atah inaki samruddhi ko dekhte hue samruddhi kii laalasaa main anya europea desh bhi upnivesh sthapit karte hue agrasar hue
 Marxist interpretations of colonialism also claim that direct political control of non-capitalist societies was necessary for the development of nineteenth-century American and European industrial capitalist economies
 is lihaaz se marxvaadi vidwaan poonjeewaad ke ubhaar ke pehle or baad ke upniveshwaad ke bich fark karte hai
 Marx has specifically considered colonialism in his Indian compositions
 marks or angels kaa vichaar tha ki upniveshon par niyantran karnaa na keval bazaaron or kachche maal ke sroton ko hathiyaane ke liye zaruri tha, balki pratidwandvi audyogic deshon se hode main aage nikalne ke liye bhi aavashyak tha
 The credit for further developing Marxist ideas of colonialism goes to Rosa Luxembourg and Lenin
 marxvaadi pariprekshya ko aalochana kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa he
 Critics say that the evidence that Marx, Rosa, and Lenin offered in favor of their thesis are not sufficient, because they do not prove the inevitability of colonialism for the development of industrial revolution and capitalism
 duusare, marxvaadi vishleshan ke paas upniveshit samaajon kaa paryaapt adhyayan or samaj maujuud nahin he
 The Asian production system that Marx discusses and the categories of Rosa that Asian societies impose cannot be drawn too far on the basis of an in-depth study of the history of these societies

 He made it his goal to rejuvenate the Aryavarta Hindu society, regardless of anyone's opposition and condemnation

 He got a new feeling

 This is your gurudakshina
 unhone aashirwad diya ki ishwar unke purusharth ko safal kare
 He gave the final teachings - Manuscripts condemn God and Rishis, not Rishikrit texts

 Do not leave this criterion by hand

 i believe that there is nothing wrong in the Gita
 iske alaava gita vedon ke khilaaf nahin he
 There is no other scriptural evidence except the Vedas - to propagate this truth, Swamiji started visiting the whole country and wherever he went, the pandits and scholars of the ancient tradition gave up on him
 sanskrit bhashaa kaa unhen agaadh gyaan tha
 He was fluent in Sanskrit
 saath hi ve prachand taarkik the
 He studied the Christian and Muslim scriptures thoroughly
 atev akele hi unhone teen-teen morchon par sangharsh aarambh kar diya
 The two fronts were of Christianity and Islam, but the third front was of Sanatanadharmi Hindus, in which Swamiji had to face many insults, stigmas and sufferings
 dayanand ne buddhivaad kii jo mashaal jalaayee thi, uskaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Neither Muslims nor Christians, nor Hindu scholars and scholars who follow the Puranas could answer what they were saying
 hindu navotthana ab puure prakaash main aa gaya tha or anek samajhadaar log man hi man anubhav karne lage the ki vastav main puranic dharm kii pongapathi main koi saar nahin he
 Swamiji strongly contradicted the evils prevalent in the prevailing religions, whether it was Sanatan Dharma or Islam or Christianity
 apane mahagranth satyarth prakaash main swamiji ne sabhi maton main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa khandan kiya he
 Unlike his contemporary reformers, Swamiji's opinion was not limited to the educated class but the Arya Samaj also attracted the ordinary masses of Aryavarta
 san 1872 i

 There Devendranath Thakur and Keshav Chandra Sen gave him a big welcome
 brahmo samaajiyon se unka vichaar-vimarsh bhi hua kintu isiyat se prabhavit brahmo samaji vidwaan punarjanm or veda kii pramanikta ke vishay main swami se ekamat nahin ho sake
 It is said that in Calcutta itself, Keshav Chandra Sen advised Swamiji that if you leave Sanskrit and start speaking in Aryabhasa, then there can be immense favor of the country
 tabhi se swami ji ke vyakhyanon kii bhashaa aryabhasha ho gayi or aryabhashi praanton main unhe aganit anuyaayi milane lage
 Swamiji came to Mumbai from Calcutta and on 10 April 1875, he founded the 'arya Samaj'
 mumbai main unke saath prarthana samaaj waalon ne bhi vichaar-vimarsh kiya
 But this society was a Mumbai version of Brahmo society
 atev swami ji se is samaaj ke log bhi ekamat nahin ho sake
 Swamiji came to Indraprastha after returning from Mumbai
 vahaan unhone satyanusndhan ke liye isai, musalmaan or hindu panditon kii ek sabha bulaayi
 But even after two days of deliberations, people could not reach any conclusion

 He was in favor of participation of all varnas and women in social restructuring

 Due to the state of foreigners being in the Aryavarta, there are differences, differences, no consumption of celibacy, reading and studying the law and self-immolation in childhood, sensuality, false language, kulakshan, propagation of Vedas, etc
 are misdeeds
 The brothers fight and then the third foreigner comes and becomes a punch
 unhone rajdhyaksh tathaa shashan kii vibhinn parishadon evam samitiyon ke liye aavashyak yogyataon ko bhi ginaya he
 He favored the system of justice based on sage pranit texts
 swami dayanand saraswati ko saamanyat: keval arya samaaj ke sansthaapak tathaa samaaj-sudhaarak ke rup main hi janaa jaataa he
 Very few people are aware of his remarkable role in the efforts made for national independence
 vastusthiti yah he ki paradheen aryaavart main yah kehane kaa saahas sambhavat: sarvapratham swami dayanand saraswati ne hi kiya tha ki "aryaavart, aryavartiyon kaa he"
 The entire plan of our First Independence Summer, 1857 revolution was also prepared under Swamiji's leadership and he was also its principal architect
 ve apane pravachanon main shrotaaon ko praaia: rashtrawaad kaa upadesh dete or desh ke liye mar mitane kii bhaavana bharte the
 In 1855, when the Kumbh Mela was held in Haridwar, Swamiji traveled from Abu Mountains to Haridwar to join it
 raste main unhone sthaan-sthaan par pravachan kiye tathaa deshavaasiyon kii nabj tatoli
 He realized that people are now fed up with the tyrannical rule of the British and are eager to fight for the independence of the country
 swami dayanand saraswati ne haridwar pahunch kar vahaan ek pahari ke ekaant sthaan par apana deraa jamaaya
 While there, he met five such people who later became the masters of the revolution of 1857
 ye paanch vyakti the naanaa sahib, ajimullah khan, bala sahab, tathya tope tathaa babu kunwar singh
 The negotiations went on for a long time and it was here that it was decided to prepare the ground for armed revolution against the Firangi government and then on a certain day, the trumpet of revolution would be played together in the whole country
 jansadharan tathaa aryavartiya sainikon main is kranti kii aawaaj ko pahunchane ke liye 'roti tathaa camel' kii bhi yojana yaheen taiyaar kii gai
 The main role in this entire discussion was that of Swami Dayanand Saraswati

 After his departure, Swamiji established contact with some of his trusted ascetics and formed a secret organization
 is sanghathan kaa mukhyalay indraprastha main mahrauli sthit yogamaya mandir main banaaya gaya
 This headquarters played a notable role in the freedom struggle
 swami ji ke netritv main saadhuon ne bhi sampoorn desh main kranti kaa alakh jagaaya
 He used to carry the messages of revolutionaries from one place to another, encouraging them and if necessary, he himself would take up arms and fight with the British
 san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn avadhi main rashtriya netaa, swami dayanand saraswati ke nirantar sampark main rahe
 Even Swami was not disappointed at the failure of freedom struggle
 unhen to is baat kaa pehle se hi abhas tha ki keval ek baar praytn karne se hi swatantrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 For this, a long process of struggle will have to be carried out
 haridwar main hi 1855 kii baithak main babu kunwar singh ne jab apane is sangharsh main safalataa kii sambhaavna ke bare main swami ji se poocha to unka bebaak uttar tha "swatantrata sangharsh kabhi asafal nahin hota
 India has gradually become a revolution in a hundred years
 ab isko swatantra hone main bhi ek sau varsh lag jaaenge
 Many precious lives will be sacrificed in the attainment of this freedom
 " swami ji kii yah bhavishyavaanee kitni sahi nikali, ise baad kii ghatnaon ne pramanit kar diya
 After the failure of freedom struggle, when Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and other national leaders met Swamiji, he also advised them not to get discouraged and wait for the right time
 1857 kii kranti ke do varsh baad swami ji ne swami virajanand ko apana guru banaaya or unase diksha lee
 Staying in Swami Virjanand's ashram, he studied the Vedas, meditated on them and after that, according to the instructions of his Guru, he started propagating Vedic knowledge
 isi uddeshy kii prapti ke liye unhone arya samaaj kii bhi sthapana kii or uske madhyam se samaaj-sudhaar ke anek kaary kiye
 He campaigned strongly against untouchability, sati, child marriage, male sacrifice, religious parochialism and superstitions and he supported widow marriage, religious generosity and mutual brotherhood
 in sabake saath swami ji logon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharne se bhi kabhi nahin chookte the
 In the beginning, many people put various obstacles in Swami ji's social reform work and opposed them
 dhire-dhire unke tark logon kii samaj main aane lage or virodh kam hua
 His popularity continued to grow
 isse angrej adhikariyon ke man main yah ichha uthi ki agar inhen angreji sarkaar ke paksh main kar liya jaae to sahaj hi unke madhyam se jansadharan main angrejon ko lokapriy banaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, British officials had likewise joined some other sermons and religious officials by giving different types of temptation
 unhone swami dayanand saraswati ko bhi unheen ke samaan samajha
 Accordingly, Swamiji was met through the then Governor General Lord Northbrook through a Christian priest
 yah mulaakaat march 1873 main kalakatta main hui
 After some formal talk here and there, Lord Northbrook humbly put his point before Swamiji - "in the beginning of your lecture, you will be able to pray for the welfare of the English government in the God you pray
 " Swami ji readily understood everything by listening to the Governor General
 unhen angreji sarkaar kii buddhi par taras bhi aayaa, jo unhen thik tarah nahin samaj saki
 He boldly and firmly replied to the Governor General- governor general ko swami ji se is prakaar ke tikhe uttar kii aashaa nahin thi
 The meeting was terminated immediately and Swamiji returned from there
 iske uparant sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag kii swami ji par tathaa unki sanstha arya-samaaj par gahari drushti rahi
 Records of each of his movements and every word he spoke began to be kept
 aam janata par unke prabhaav se sarkaar ko ahsaas hone laga ki yah baagi fakir or aryasamaj kisi bhi din sarkaar ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Therefore, various types of conspiracies were started to eliminate Swamiji
 swami ji kii mrityu jin paristhitiyon main hui, usase bhi yahi abhas miltaa he ki usamen nishchit hi agreji sarkaar kaa koi shadyantr tha
 Swami ji died on October 30, 1883, at dusk on the day of Deepawali
 un dinon ve jodhpur naresh maharaj jaswant singh ke nimantran par jodhpur gayi hue the
 His frequent discourses were there
 yadakada maharaj jaswant singh bhi unke charnon main baithkar vahaan unke pravachan sunate
 Two or four times Swamiji also went to the state palaces
 vahaan par unhone nanheen naamak veshya kaa anaavashyak hastkshep or maharaj jaswant singh par uskaa atyadhik prabhaav dekha
 Swamiji felt it very bad
 unhone maharaj ko is bare main samajhaayaa to unhone vinamrata se unki baat sweekaar kar lee or nanheen se sambandh tod liye
 This led to a lot of opposition against the little Swamiji
 usne swami ji ke rasoie kaliya urf jagannatha ko apni taraf mila kar unke doodh main pisa hua kaanch dalava diya
 Shortly afterwards Swami came to confess his crime and apologized for it
 udaar-hriday swami ji ne use raah-kharch or jivan-yaapan ke liye paanch sau rupye dekar vahaan se vidaa kar diya taaki police use pareshaan na kare
 Later, when Swamiji was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, the concerned doctor also remained under suspicion
 us par aarope tha ki vah aushadhi ke naam par swami ji ko halkaa vish pilaataa rahaa
 Later, when Swamiji's health started deteriorating, he was brought to the hospital in Ajmer
 magar tab tak kaaphi vilamb ho chukaa tha
 Swamiji could not be saved
 is sampoorn ghatnakram main ashanka yahi he ki veshya ko ubhaarne tathaa chikitsak ko bargalane kaa kaary angreji sarkaar ke ishaare par kisi angrej adhikari ne hi kiya
 Otherwise it was not possible for an ordinary prostitute to do such a conspiracy against a well-known and popular person like Swami Dayanand Saraswati only on his own
 bina kisi protsaahan or sangrakshan ke chikitsak bhi aisa dussahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 The body of Swami Dayanand ji, the pioneer of Swadharma, Swabhasa, Swarashtra, self-culture and indigenous promotion, merged into Panchatatva on the day of Diwali in 1883 and he left behind a principle, Krishnamanto Vishwamaryam - that is, make the whole world the best human
 unke antim shabd the - "prabhu! tuune acchhee lila kii
 May your wish be fulfilled
 " Swami Dayanand Saraswati wrote many religious and social books during his lifetime

 Khoj is a 1989 Hindi language film
 jin praaniyon main ridh nahin hoti unhen aksheruki yaa aprishthvanshi kehete hai
 That department of science is called invertebrate embryology in which the idea of the birth of children in such beings is considered
 aprishthvanshi praaniyon ko 15-16 shreniyon main baanta gaya he, tathaapi inke bhrunvigyaan se yahi siddh hota he ki yah vibhaag keval bahyik he or praaniyon main, visheshkar bhrunon main, ek antarnihit paraspar sambandh he jiske dwaara vikaswad kii pushti hoti he
 Differentiation of beings is due to their environment and accordingly their lifespan
 is siddhant ke anusaar sabhi praaniyon ko keval do vibhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he
 One is the Adyamukhi and the other the second in donon shakhaon ko sharkrumivarg sambandhit karata he
 This proves that primordial in the development of animals should be first and then second
 dwitiyamukhi se sabhi prishthvanshiyon kaa vikaas hua
 Most animals have male and female isolates
 nar shukranu srijan karte hai tathaa maadaa andey detii he
 a child is born by the combination of these two
 parantu nimna shrenee ke bahut se praani aise bhi hote hai jinamein nar or maadaa main koi prabhed nahin hota or ve shukranu athwa andey nahin dete
 Their growth is caused by bifurcation, or germination, or spore formation of the entire body
 inase kuch adhik unnat praaniyon main do aise praani thode samay ke liye sanyukt hote hai or uske pashchaat pun: vibhaajan dwaara vansh kii vruddhi karte hai
 Even in these more advanced beings, it is seen that two separate beings are completely united with each other and they do not remain separate entities
 aise sanyog ke pashchaat phir vibhaajan tathaa khandan dwaara vansh kii vruddhi hoti he
 Such animals belong to a single cell whose entire body is made up of only one shell
 par inamen kuch aise bhi hote hai jo ucch shrenee ke praaniyon kii bhanti shukranu tathaa andon kaa aakaar grahan kar lete hai or in donon ke sanyog ke pashchaat pun: khandan tathaa vibhaajan kriya prachlit hoti he
 The growth of the unicellular body, being a single cell, only increases the volume of the cell
 parantu nackoshin praaniyon main sharir kii vruddhi kramshil hoti he
 In this early growing stage they are called embryos and they undergo a lot of change before attaining perfection
 bhrun bhi praarambhik avasthaa main ek hi kosh kaa hota he, yadhyapi yah do vibhinn koshon, shukranu tathaa andey, kii sanyuktavastha he, jise yugmaj kehete hai
 This zygote is formed by penetrating successively, but its affinity with unicellular is that the split cells do not become isolated
 in nae koshon kii pragati ore nirupan do bhij paddatiyon par hote hai
 In some beings, the future of these new shells is determined at a very early period, which determines the organs they will create
 is paddati ko visheshit vibhinnata athwa kuttimochitra vikaas kehete hai
 By dividing such a divisible egg into two equal parts, each block can make only half of that animal
 duusari paddati main angon kaa nirdhaaran prathamvastha main nahin hota or aise andon kaa do bhaagon main vibhaajan karne se yadhyapi ve aaytan main chote ho jate hai, tathpi prayek bhaag sampurna praani ko banaata he
 Such a division system is called unsystematic or regulatory penetration
 parantu kuch avadhi ke pashchaat inamen bhi koshon kaa bhavishya pratham paddati kii bhanti nirdhaarit ho jaataa he or us samay andon kaa vibhaajan karne par praani purnang nahin banataa
 Generally, food is stored as eggs inside the eggs
 vardhansheel bhrun kii pushti pitak se hoti rahati he
 There are mainly three types of distribution of Pitaka within the egg
 pratham main pitak kii maatra bahut kam hoti he ore vah saare andey main samaan rup se vistrut rahata he
 Such eggs are called appellate
 duusare prakaar main pitak kii maatra bahut adhik hoti he ore vah andey ke nimnabhaag main ekatrit rahata he
 Such an egg is said to drink alone
 tisare prakaar main pitak andey ke madhya bhaag main sthit rahata he
 Such eggs are called centerpieces
 pitak kii maatra tathaa uski sthiti ke anusaar andey kaa vibhaajan bhinn--bhinn prakaar kaa hota he
 Pitak is a hindrance to the division action
 apiti andey sampurna rup se vibhajit hote hai
 Such partition system is called complete discrimination
 parantu ekat: piti andon main pitak ke neeche kii ore ekatrit hone ke kaaran andey kaa upree bhaag shuddh tathaa sakriy rahata he or vibhaajan kriya keval upree bhaag main aabaddh rahati he
 The lower part is not divided in the initial period
 aisi aanshik vibhaajan pranali ko apurna bhedan kehete hai
 Where the victim lives in the center of the egg, the division action remains only at the periphery
 aisi vibhaajan pranali ko uparishthabhedan kehete hai
 In most eggs, the active upper part and the relatively inactive lower part are already visible - the upper part is called zoological pole and the lower part is called vaginal or vaginal pole
 andon kaa vibhaajan vibhinn prakaar kii samamitiyon ke anusaar vibhijh hota he
 In bipartite symmetry, the first dividing line is like a stripe of melon, which results in the formation of two shells
 inhen donon koshon se sharir ke dakshin or vam parshv kii sristi hoti hai
 The two sides divide equally
 trijya samamiti kii visheshta yah he ki vibhaajan rekhaayen sadaa ek duusare ko urdhwadhar rekhaon dwaara katati hai or aksh ke chaaron ore samaan rup se koshon kii vruddhi hoti he
 Apart from this, there is also a third way in which the dividing line curves and once in a sequence, tilts to the right and second time to the left
 aisi pranali ko kuntal bhedan kehete hai, par inkaa antim parinaam dwiparshv samamiti hoti he
 In bivar symmetry, the first division is bipartite, but after that the practice of triangular symmetry prevails in both sides
 vibhaajan kriya teevr gati se hoti he--koshon kii sankhya badhati jaati he, par aaytan main ve chote hote jate hai
 Finally, a multicellular embryo is formed which is called monocyte
 nae kosh sab is gole kii paridhi par hote hai or bich main lasika se bharaa ek vivar rahata he
 This cavity is called Ekabhiktika cavity
 aisi khokhli ekabhiktika ko guhiy ekabhiktika kehete hai
 Its outer wall has only a single shell depth
 ekat: piti andon main neeche kii ore pitak ke sanchay ke kaaran ekabhiktika guha upar kii ore banati he
 The division is only over the egg, where the quantity of the vitellus is high
 aabaddh rahata he or ekabhiktika guha bahut hi sankshipt rup main banati he
 This type of monologue is called bimbakabhiktika
 jin andon main pitak madhyasthal main rahata he unamem vibhaajan keval paridhi main hota he
 Such a monologue is called paribhakabhiktika
 kuch praaniyon main ekabhiktika thos hoti he or golai ke bheetar bhi kosh bhare rahete hai
 In such a situation, Ekabhiktika is called concentric Bhiktika Bhittika Athva Tutta
 chhidrishton main ekabhiktika avasthaa main mukhadwar banataa he, is kaaran aisi ekabhiktika ko mukhekabhiktika kehete hai
 This is not the case with other animals
 jab tak ek partavaali ekabhiktika kramash: do partavaali banati he tab tak bhrun ko syutibhrun kehete hai
 The second layer is made up of many different methods
 sabase saral pranali apiti andon main hoti he
 In this, the lower part of the monolith, Varadhrirava, enters the cavity cavity respectively
 or ant main bhitari part bahari part se mil jaati he
 The unicellular cavity ceases to exist and a second cavity is formed in its place which is now covered by two layers
 is vivar main neeche kii ore ek chhidr hone ke kaaran yah khulaa rahata he
 This hole is called Adyantramukh
 syutibhrun banane kii is pranali ko antargaman athwa amboli kii pratha kehete hai
 The outer layer is called outer layer and inner layer is called inner layer
 ant:str se in praaniyon kii pachakanal tathaa usase utpann sabhi angon kaa vikaas hota he
 For this reason, the effluent from the inner level is called Adyantra
 adhiktar aprishthvanshi praaniyon main aadyantrmukh unke agrabhag kaa nirdeshak hota he or usase yaa uske nikat unka mukhadwar banataa he

 buddha darshan main saamaanya kaa khandan karke namjatyasanyut arth ko hi shabdaarth mana gaya he
 The Nyayamimamsa philosophies state that language cannot exist without normal or caste
 prayek vyakti ke liye alag shabd ho to bhashaa kaa vyavhaar nasht ho jayega
 Unity in plurality is the origin of behavioral language and this is said to be normal from an elemental point of view
 bhashaa hi nahin, gyaan ke kshetra main bhi saamaanya kaa mahatv he kyonki yadi ek gyaan ko duusare gyaan se pruthak mana jaae to ek hi vastu ke anek gyaanon main paraspar koi sambandh nahin ho sakegaa
 Therefore, the general or caste is considered a regular entity living among many people
 yahi satta bhashaa ke vyavhaar kaa kaaran he or bhashaa kaa bhi yahi arth he
 According to Buddhists, all things are transient, so they do not consider the power of the common
 yadi saamaanya nity he to vah anek vyaktiyon main kaise rahata he? yadi saamaanya nity he to nasht padaarth main rahanevaale saamaanya kaa kya hota he? at: vah kisi anya vastu se sambandhit na hokar apane aapmen hi vishisht ek satta he jise swalakshan kaha jaataa he
 In many self-respecting substances, there is a false belief of unity due to ignorance and since such a belief is required for public behavior, the common characteristic substances are practical truths, but they are essentially untrue
 shabdon kaa arth parmarthat: saamaanya ke sambandh se rahit hokar hi bhaasith haata he
 This is called 'anapoha' or 'apoha'
 apoh siddhant ke vikaas ke teen str maane jate hai
 According to Dinaag, words simply mean imperfection
 shantrakshit ne kaha ki shabd bhavatmak arth kaa bodh karaata he, uskaa anya se bhed uha se maaloom hota he
 Ratnakirti considered other words with distinct distinction

 Just as Gau means prohibition of agau, this chauvinism of Buddhists is the culmination of their elemental, logical thinking
 bauddhow ne apane tatv chintan m yah sthapit kiya he ki kisi bhi vastu kii koi sanathan yaa nirpeksh satta nahi he, jo bhi sat he vah kshanik he, aisi sthiti m swabhaavat yah prashn uth khada hota he jab kisi vastu kaa koi rup sthir nahi he to phir kisi shabd kaa sanketit arth kise mana jaae tathaa kyaa mana jaae jab ham kisi vastu jaise gaay ko dekhakar aisa kahat he yah gaay he to shabd kaa uccharan karne se purv hi samvedit vastu kaa swaroop parivartit ho jaataa he aisi sthiti m shabd se vastu sat kaa nirdesan nahi kiya ja saktaa he
 The object is true self-respect which is devoid of known knowledgeable distinction and is non-optional

 Diddnag considered prajna prohibition in reference to the word Buddhist
 It was the expressive meaning of the word
 Had
 shantrakshit ise sweekaar karata he 1 Here, to know an object indicated by a single word, it is necessary to prohibit innumerable things
 To rule out all, one must have knowledge of them which is impossible
 2 apohawaad ko maanane par vyaavhaarik jivan m gyaan kii vyakhya kathin ho jaaegi
 Showing an elephant to a child is enough to tell that it is an elephant, there is no need for double prohibition
 vastutah apohawaad kaa uddeshy bhashaa kii us pravriti ko dur karnaa hajisamen ham shabdon ke anuroop ham bahya vastuon ko sweekaar kar lete he inke anusaar shabd kaa swaroop \ arth maanav rachit he Pattaravakkam is a region in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu

 Yashwantrao Holkar was the son of Tukoji Holkar
 vah uddand hote hue bhi bada saahsee tathaa daksh senanayake tha
 The intervention of Daulatrao Shinde on the question of succession on the death of Tukojji and the slaughter of Yashwantrao's elder brother Malharrao in the Tajjit war, motivated by a sense of vengeance, caused Yashwantrao to loot relentlessly in Shinde's kingdom
 ahilya bai kaa sanchit kosh haath aa jane se uski shakti or bhi bad gai
 In 1802, he defeated the Peshwa and Shinde forces together, which made the Peshwa flee Basai and made a treaty with the British
 falswaroop dwitiya angl-maratha yuddh chhid gaya
 Yashwantrao made a huge mistake in leaving the Marathas due to disharmony with Shinde because after the defeat of Bhonsle and Shinde, Holkar had to fight the British alone
 pehle ta yashwantrao ne monson par vijay pai, kintu, farrukhabad tathaa deeg main uski paraajay hui
 As a result, he had to enter into a treaty with the British
 Finally, he died at the age of thirty, in complete disarray

 The only ruler whose fear was clearly visible in the British

 a ruler whom his own people repeatedly deceived, yet never lost courage in the battlefield
 itnaa mahaan tha wo bhartiya shaasha, phir bhi itihaas ke pannon main wo kahin khoyaa hua he
 Even today many people do not know about him

 main hua
 His father was Tukojirao Holkar
 holkar samrajya ke badhate prabhaav ke kaaran gwalior ke shaasha daulataraav sindhiya ne yashwantrao ke bade bhai malharav ko maut kii neend sula diya
 This incident completely broke Yashwantrao
 unka apano par se vishwaas uth gaya
 After this he started strengthening himself
 ye apane kaam main kaaphi hoshiyaar or bahadur the
 It can be gauged from this that in 1802 AD they defeated the combined forces of Peshwa Bajirao II of Pune and Scindia and returned to Indore
 is dauraan angrej bharat main teji se apane paanv pasaar rahe the
 a new challenge had come before Yashwant Rao
 bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karana
 For this he needed the help of other Indian rulers
 ve angrejon ke badhate samrajya ko roak dena chaahate the
 For this, he again joined hands with Bhonsle of Nagpur and Scindia of Gwalior and decided to chase the British
 lekin puraani dushmani ke kaaran bhonsle or sindhiya ne unhen phir dhokhaa diya or yashwantrao ek baar phir akele pad gaye
 He once again urged other rulers to unite and fight against the British, but nobody listened to them
 iske baad unhone akele dam par angrejon ko chhathi kaa doodh yaad dilaane kii thaanee
 On 8 June 1804, he defeated the British army
 phir 8 july 1804 i
 main kota se unhone angrejon ko khaded diya
 On 11 September 1804 AD, the British general Wellesley wrote to Lord Luke that if Yashwantrao was not overcome quickly, he along with other rulers would drive the British out of India
 isi maddenjar november, 1804 i
 main angrejon ne dig par hamalaa kar diya
 In this war, together with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Bharatpur, he reminded the British of his grandmother
 yahi nahin itihaas ke mutabik unhone 300 angrejon kii naak hi kaat daali thi
 Suddenly Ranjit Singh too left Yashwantrao and joined hands with the British
 iske baad sindhiya ne yashwantrao kii bahaduree dekhte hue unase haath milaayaa
 The concern of the British increased
 lord ljuk ne likhaa ki yashwantrao kii sena angrejon ko maarane main bahut anand leti he
 After this, the British decided that a deal with Yashwantrao could only be done
 isliye unke saath bina shart sandhi kii jaae
 Whatever they want, they should be given
 unka jitna samrajya he, sab lautaa diya jaae
 Despite this, Yashwantrao refused the treaty
 ve sabhi shaskaon ko ekajute karne main jute hue the
 In the end, when he did not succeed, he thought of defeating the British with another trick
 is maddenjar unhone 1805 i
 main angrejon ke saath sandhi kar lee
 The British considered them independent rulers and returned all their territories
 iske baad unhone sindhiya ke saath milakar angrejon ko khadedane kaa ek or plan banaaya
 He wrote a letter to Scindia, but Scindia turned out to be a traitor and showed the letter to the British
 iske baad puraa maamla phir se bighad gaya
 Yashwantrao shouted and started preparing to beat the British on his own
 iske liye unhone bhanpur main gola barood kaa kaarkaana kholaa
 This time he was determined to drive out the British
 isliye din-raat mehnat karne main jute gaye the
 Due to constant hard work, his health also started falling
 lekin unhone is ore dhyaan nahin diya or 28 oktober 1811 i
 main sirf 35 saal kii umr main ve swarg sidhaar gaye
 In this way a great ruler came to an end
 ek aise shaasha kaa jisapar angrej kabhi adhikaar nahin jamaa sake
 Of a ruler who spent his young age in the battlefield
 yadi bhartiya shaskaon ne unka saath diya hota to shaayad tasviir kuch or hoti, lekin aisa nahin hua or ek mahaan shaasha yashwantrao holkar itihaas ke pannon main kahin kho gaya or kho gai unki bahaduree, jo aaj anjaan bani hui he

 Humanity has a terrible danger in every era All the great heroes of Satyuga, Tretayuga, Dwaparyuga and Kali Yuga have been demonized by Yugam, a divine superpower and divided them into two teams! One party has Satyuga, Tretayuga, the great heroes of Dwaparyuga and the other party has the greatest heroes of Kaliyuga! There will be unique competitions between the two parties, and the era of whichever party wins will exist in the universe, the era of the other party will be erased forever! Competitions have started, the guards are fighting with the guards! Only the winners of these bloody battles will be able to save their people and their era!

 Kashyapamhita is the joy and primordial text of virginity
 ise 'vrudhjivakiyatantra' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Maharishi Kashyap has ranked the virginity first among the eight organs of Ayurveda
 isaki rachana isapurv 6thi shatabdi main hui thi
 It was translated into Chinese in the Middle Ages

 This Code is found in fragmented form in Nepal

 The Kashyapa Samhita obtained at present is complete in itself
 maharishi kashyap dwaara prokt is vishaal ayurveda kaa kalkram se prachaar-prasar jab kam hone laga to richik muni ke pachanwarsheeya putr jeevak ne is vishaal kaashyap samhita ko sankshipt karke haridwar ke kankhal main samavet vidwaanon ke samaksh prastut kiya
 The scholars present rejected it as child-centered
 tab balak jeevak ne vahiin unke saamne ganga kii dhara main dubkee lagaayi
 After a while, the organisms from the Ganges stream emerged as overgrowth
 unhen vruddh rup main dekh, chakit vidwaanon ne unhen 'vrudhjivak' naam se abhihit kiya or unke dwaara pratipaadit us ayurveda tantra kon ‘vrudhjivakeey tantra’ ke rup main manyata di
 Looking at the theme of Kashyapa Samhita shows that its plan is the same as Charak Samhita
 yah nau 'sthanon' main varnit he- Among them, the origin of children, diagnosis, treatment, impersonation of planets, etc
, and material related to virginity in the body, sense and plane are available in plenty
 sabhi sthanon main bich-bich main kumaron ke vishay main jo prashnottar prastut kiye gayi hai isse samhita kii vishistataa jhalkati he
 Kashyapamhita mentions new facts regarding kumarbhata, such as dental hygiene, mention of Mridusveda in infants, symptoms of Ayushman child, Vedana in Vedanadhyaya by various gestures for children who do not show their pain, children

 kashyap yaa kaashyap ke naam se teen samhitaayein milti hai : The word Kashyap is also gotravachi; The original sage's name appears to be Kashyapa
 matsay puraana main marich ke putr kashyap ko mul gotrapravartak kaha gaya he; parantu aage chalakar kashyap marich bhi kaha he
 In Charak Samhita, Kashyap has written separately 'marichikashpau'
 isamen marich kashyap kaa visheshan he
 Similarly, in a text of Charaka, 'kashyapo Bhringu:' this text has come up
 isamen kaashyayap gotrotpann bhrigu kaa ullekh he
 In this way, where the word Kashyap is gotravachi, there is also a person name
 vrudhjivakeey tantra main 'iti ha smah kashyap:' yaa 'ityah kashyap:', 'iti kashyap:', 'kashyapobravit' aadi vachan milte hai, isse inkaa acharya hona spasht hai

 This shows that Marich has come for the word Kashyap

 The Kashyapa Samhita also mentions the opinion of the elder Kashyapa

 It appears that the elder Kashyapa and the Samhitaakar Kashyapa are different people

 Madhavnidan's Madhukosh Tika has also given a pledge in the case of the old poison named Kashyap
 ye donon kashyap purv kashyap se bhinn hai
 Probably because of gotra, he has been called Kashyapa
 ashtangaruday main bhi kashyap or kashyap naam se do yoga die gaye hai
 Both of these yogas meet the available Kashyapamshitha
 kaashyapasanhita main samast ayurvedic vishyon kaa prashnottar rup main nirupan kiya gaya hai

 According to Yask, Dadhichi's mother was 'chitti' and father was 'atharva', hence his name was 'dadhichi'
 kisi puraana ke anusaar yah kardam rishi kii kanya 'shanti' ke garbh se utpann atharva ke putr the
 Dadhichi was the supreme ascetic and eminent Maharishi of ancient times
 unki patni kaa naam 'gabhastini' tha
 Maharishi Dadhichi was very knowledgeable in the Vedas, scriptures etc
 and was very kind

 He always considered his ultimate religion to be good for others

 jo bhi atithi maharishi dadhichi ke ashram par aata, swayan maharishi tathaa unki patni atithi kii purna shraddha bhav se seva karte the
 Though there have been many donations in 'indian History', but Maharishi Dadhichi was the only one who donated his bones for human welfare
 devataaon ke mukh se yah jaanakar kii maatr dadhichi kii asthiyon se nirmit vajra dwaara hi asuron kaa sanhaar kiya ja saktaa he, maharishi dadhichi ne apana sharir tyaag kar asthiyon kaa daan kar diya
 Maharishi Dadhichi's name is taken with great respect among those who self-sacrifice for public welfare
 yask ke matanusaar dadhichi kii mata 'chitti' or pita 'atharva' the, isiilie inkaa naam 'dadhichi' hua tha
 According to some Puranas, he was the son of Atharva, born from the womb of the daughter 'shanti' of Kardam
 anya purananusaar yah shukracharya ke putr the
 Maharishi Dadhichi was an icon of penance and purity
 bhagwaan shiv ke prati atoot bhakthi or vairaygy main inaki janm se hi nishtha thi
 It is said that once a demon named 'vritrasura' took control of Indraloka and drove the gods including Indra out of heaven
 sabhi devtaa apni vyathaa lekar brahma, vishnu va mahesh ke paas gaye, lekin koi bhi unki samasya kaa nidaan na kar sakaa
 Later Brahma Ji told the gods a remedy that a Maharishi named 'dadhichi' lives in the earth
 yadi ve apni asthiyon kaa daan kar den to un asthiyon se ek vajra banaaya jaye
 With that thunderbolt Vritrasura can be killed, because Vritrasura cannot be killed by any weapon
 maharishi dadhichi kii asthiyon main hi vah brahm tej he, jisase vritrasur rakshas maaraa ja saktaa he
 There is no other way apart
 indra kaa sankoch Devraj Indra did not want to go to Maharishi Dadhichi, because Indra once insulted Dadhichi, due to which he was reluctant to go to Dadhichi
 mana jaataa he ki brahm vidya kaa gyaan puure vishwa main keval maharishi dadhichi ko hi tha
 Maharshi wanted to give knowledge of this knowledge to only specific person, but Indra was very keen to get Brahman knowledge
 dadhichi kii drushti main indra is vidya ke paatr nahin the
 Therefore he refused to give this knowledge to Indra
 dadhichi ke inkaar karne par indra ne unhen kisi anya ko bhi yah vidya dene ko manaa kar diya or kaha ki- "yadi aapane aisa kiya to main aapkaa sir dhad se alag kar doongaa"
 The Maharishi said that- "if he finds a qualified person, he will definitely give him theology
" " kuch samay baad indralok se hi ashvinikumar maharishi dadhichi ke paas brahm vidya lene pahunche
 Dadhichi found Ashwinikumar eligible for Brahman learning
 unhone ashvinikumaron ko indra dwaara kahi gai baaten bataayin
 Then Ashvinikumar attained Brahmanism by putting the head of Maharishi Dadhichi's horse
 indra ko jab yah jaankaree mili to vah prithvi lok main aaye or apni ghoshnaa ke anusaar maharishi dadhichi kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 The Ashvinikumaras retook Maharishi's real head
 indra ne ashvinikumaron ko indralok se nikaal diya
 This was the reason that now Indra did not want to come to Maharishi Dadhichi to ask for donation of his ashes
 ve is kaary ke liye bada hi sankoch mahasoos kar rahe the
 Donation of bones by Dadhichi devloak par vritrasur rakshas ke atyaachaar din-pratidin badhate hi ja rahe the
 He was disturbing the gods very much
 antatah devraj indra ko indralok kii raksha va devataaon kii bhalaai ke liye or apane singhaasana ko bachaane ke liye devataaon sahit maharishi dadhichi kii sharan main janaa hi padaa
 Maharishi Dadhichi paid full respect to Indra and asked the reason for coming to the ashram
 indra ne maharishi ko apni vyathaa sunai to dadhichi ne kaha ki- "main devloak kii raksha ke liye kya kar saktaa hoon
 "the gods told him the things that happened to Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh and asked for donations of their ashes
 maharishi dadhichi ne bina kisi hichkichaahat ke apni asthiyon kaa daan dena sweekaar kar liya
 He set up a tomb and gave up his body
 us samay unki patni ashram main nahin thi
 Now the problem came before the Gods, who should remove the flesh of Maharishi Dadhichi's body
 is kaary ke dhyaan main aate hi sabhi devtaa saham gaye
 Then Indra called Kamadhenu the cow and asked him to remove the flesh from the body of Maharishi
 kamdhenu ne apni jeebh se chaat-chatkar maharishi ke sharir kaa maans utaar diya
 Now only the cage of bones was left
 gabhastini kii jid Maharishi Dadhichi gave up his body for the good of the gods, but when his wife 'ghabhastini' came back to the ashram, seeing her husband's body, she started mourning and insisting on being Sati
 tab devataao ne unhen bahut manaa kiya, kyonki vah garbhvatee thi
 The gods advised him not to have sati for his dynasty
 lekin gabhastini nahin maani
 Then everyone requested them to hand over their wombs to the gods
 is par gabhastini raji ho gai or apana garbh devataaon ko saunpkar swayan sati ho gai
 In order to save the womb of the goddess, the Gods entrusted Peepal to take care of him
 kuch samay baad vah garbh palakar shishu hua to pipal dwaara paalan poshan karne ke kaaran uskaa naam 'pippalad' rakhaa gaya
 For this reason, the descendants of Dadhichi are called 'dadhich'

 shwa vilopan vah pratikriya he jisamen hindi, kashmiri, punjabi, gujarati, marathi, bengali, maithili or bahut-si anya aadhunik hind-arya bhashaaon main sahi uccharan ke liye unki lipiyon ke vyanjanon main nihit shwa kii dhwani ko tyaagna anivaary he
 This deletion is very important for the mother tongue of those languages to be understood and the tone of the speaker is right
 is shwa vilopan ke bina vaachak yaa to spasht gair-maatrubhaashi lagata he yaa phir use samajhane main hi kathinaayee ho sakati he
 Schwag deletions are a challenge for computer-readers and learners of languages because scripts in these languages often do not explain where to place and discard shwah
 aadhunik hindi ko likhane ke liye devanagari lipi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jisamen aupchaarik rup se har vyanjan ke ant main agar halant na laga ho to 'a' ki dhwani jodi jaati he
 But for correct pronunciation of Hindi, the 'schwa elimination rule' of Hindi says that this shwa is often removed at the end of words and under certain circumstances
 ise kabhi-kabhi is prakaar se likhaa jaataa he: 'a -> ø | swar vyanjan _vyanjan swar'
 This means that according to the script, if a vowel is followed by a consonant followed by a vowel and is followed by a vowel that also has a vowel behind it, the middle vowel is discarded
 masalan 'ajgar' shabd ko dekha jaae to yah 'a+j+a+g+a+r+a' he lekin shabd ke ant vaala 'a' or 'a+j' or 'g+a' ke bich kaa 'a' donon hataa die jate hai, jis se 'ajgar' shabd kaa saadhaaran bolchaal main sahi hindi uccharan 'ajgar' he
 This is often evident in transliterating English
 'patna' shahar ko dekha jaae to lipi ke anusaar yah 'p+a+t+a+n+aa' he, jo angreji main 'patanā' likhaa jayega 
 But the Schwah deletion rule removes the middle Schwah, so in fact the correct pronunciation is 'p + a + t + n + aa', ie 'pat
nā'
 usee tarah 'uttar pradesh' ko agar aupchaarik lipi ke anusaar dekha jaae to yah 'uttara pradesha' hona chahie, lekin shwa vilopan kii vajah se yah 'uttar pradesh' ban jaataa he
 Note that due to the Schwah deletion, the pronunciation of certain syllable groups changes according to the situation in their word
 'saral' kaa uccharan 's+a+r+a+l' he jisamen ant kaa shwa villopit he
 But in 'sarla' the 'A' of the middle 'R' is removed as per rules, ie 'S + a + a + L'
 usee tarah 'paalak' or 'palki' main bich ke 'l' kaa shwa pehle to rakhaa jaataa he lekin dusre shabd se hataa diya jaataa he
 In the same way, the correct pronunciation of 'beats' in 'dil ki dhadkan' is 'dhadakne', ie the air of 'e' was removed
 lekin 'dil dhadkane laga' main 'dhadkane' kaa sahi uccharan 'dhadakne' he, yani is dafaa 'd' kaa shwa rakhaa gaya lekin 'k' kaa shwa hataaya gaya
 Mother tongues in Hindi pronounce these words comfortably without thinking, but this makes it difficult for non-female speakers and computers
 aksar unke galat uccharan se unki boli 'ajeeb' or 'sunne vaale ke liye samajhanen main kathin' lagati he
