 pracheen, 2
 Middle Carpet and 3
 aadhunik-
 Early literature is more important from the point of view of Bengal's life and its merits and demerits
 chandidas, krittivas, maladhar, pipalai, lochanda, gyaandas, kavikankan, mukundaram, krishnadas, kashiram das, bharatchandaray, gunakar aadi kavi isi kaal main hue hai
 Like other scholars of India, the scholars of Bengal used to give special importance to the works of Sanskrit
 unki drushti main vahi "amar bharti" kaa pad sushobhit kar sakati thi

 It can be called Nagar or Shaurseni Apabhransh, which was largely the language of western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Punjab and Rajasthan
 saamaanya janata ke liye in donon bhashaaon main thodaa sa sahitya vidyaman tha
 Songs of love and devotion, proverbs and folklore were found in the mother tongue

 47 Chariyapads are of special importance in the available compositions of the ancient Bengali
 ye praaia: aath panktiyon ke rahasyamay geet hai jinka sambandh mahayan bauddhadharm tathaa nathpanth, donon se sambhddha gupt sampradaay se he
 Their common external meaning is often understood in this way and the deeper meaning can also be understood with the help of Sanskrit commentary, which was received with this collection as well as Sri Harprasad Shastri
 in geeton yaa padyon main "kavita" naam kii cheez to nahin he kintu jivan kii ekaadh jhalak avashya kisi kisi main dekh padati he

 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki in padon kii rachana mulat: puraani banglaa main yaa apbhransh main kii gai thi or phir unamem thodaa parivartan kar sanskrit ke anuroop bana diya gaya
 In this way Jayadeva can be considered a famous poet of ancient Bengal, who in addition to Sanskrit, probably composed in Old Bengali too
 jo ho, bengal ke kitne hi pargami kaviyon ko unase prerana mili, isamen andeh nahin
 There is no evidence that there has been a big poem written in the old Bengali
 us samay aisi rachanaayen bengal main bhi praaia: apbhransh main hi hoti thim
 However, when the famous poet Vidyapati of Mithila composed the famous historical poem, he also practiced it not in his mother tongue Maithili, but in Apabhramsa, although in between, the words Maithil have also been used

 It was during this period that the Bengali-speaking Muslim population emerged and grew gradually
 turk akramanakariyon main se bahuton ne bengal kii striyon se hi vivaah kar liya or dhire-dhire "yahan kii bhashaa, rahan sahan aadi ko" apana liya
 They forgot Turkish and Arabic remained the language of religion only

 This story was probably prevalent before the arrival of Muslims, but the first story based on it was composed in Bengali in the 15th century

 Chandidas, a famous poet of the pre-secondary Bengali, is considered
 inke naam se koi 1200 pad yaa kavitaayen prachlit hai
 There is so much difference in their language, style etc
 that they do not seem to be composed by the same person
 aisa prathit hota he ki madhyamik banglaa main is naam ke kam se kam teen kavi hue
 The first Chandidas were the pioneers of Srikrishnakirtan who existed before Chaitanya, around 1400 AD

 He composed most of the songs of Radha Krishna's love interest that earned Chandidas such a popularity

 ab emsisi keval niyamon kaa sangrakshak evam khel kii bhaavana kaa sarankshak hi rah gaya
 The MCC amended the rules of cricket in 1788 and continued to republish them and remain the copyright holder
 It formed its own team, some of which were placed in the first category based on opposition status: for example, to mark the start of every English season, traditionally the champions of the country at MCC Lord's Feeds emsisi ke paksh niyamit rup se videshi daure karte hai, udhaaharan ke liye 2006 main afghanistan kaa daura or club har sijan main pure britain ke daure karata rahaa he, vishesh rup se skulon ke saath
 It is generally believed that MCC was established in 1787 when Thomas Lord opened the ground on the site purchased
 It is now occupied by Dorset Square which the club adopted as their home venue
 In fact, 1787-MCC was a reorganization of an old club that originated in the early 18th century or possibly earlier

 The origin of the color of the MCC is unknown, but its players often wore a sporty sky blue dress until the 19th century
 The club eventually adopted the red and yellow dress
 One theory is that MCC obtained these colors from J&W Nickelson & Co
's count, when William Nicholson, the company's chairman and mcc's benefactor, secured the club's position at Lourd with debt
 ek or siddhant, ko club kii utpatti se sambandhit he vah yah he ki emsisi ne apane rangon ko ek sansthaapak sangrakshak ke rangon se praapt kiya, yah sangrakshak gudwood fame ke charles duk of richmond tha
 Although MCC formulates the rules of cricket and is also the copyright holder, the role remains under constant pressure as the ICC controls all aspects of world-class sports
 haal hi ke samay main isisi ne match ke vinimanon main parivartan karne shuru kiye hai, jiske liye emsisi ke saath adhik paraamarsh nahin kiya jaataa he
 Also, by shifting its status from Lourd to Dubai, the ICC indicated a departure from the MCC and from the past, although the taxation benefit was withdrawn by the then UK government
 cricket ke niyamon main parivartan aaj bhi emsisi ke dwaara kiye jate hai, lekin keval isisi ke saath paraamarsh ke baad

 To join the waiting list of applicants for membership, a person needs to vote for three members, and for this he needs an additional sponsorship of one person on the list of MCC sponsors
 Because the demand for membership is always more than the requirement every year, there remains a sufficient waiting list for full general membership
 However it takes time to become a full-time member: the individual may need to qualify as a player member, or may need to be an out-match member

 The then MCC Secretary and Chief Executive Roger Knight represented the club on the ecb's board and was in favor of this controversial and critical decision
 ek or vivaad main shaamil tha ki emsisi ne sadasyon tathaa darshakon ko sabhi maichon main ground par simit maatra main alcohol yut peya padaarth laane kii anumati dene kaa faisla kiya tha
 The decision challenged the ICC, which was attempting to completely ban the practice in all international matches worldwide
 emsisi saal main ek baar isisi ko likhata he ki lord cricket ground main alcohol laane ke liye darshakon tathaa sadasyon ko anumati di jaye
 kisi anya ground praadhikaran ko kabhi is baat kii zarurat mahasoos nahin hui ki cricket ke maidan main ve darshakon or sadasyon ke liye alcohol laane ke liye isisi se anumati kii maang karen
 yaa khud vahaan alcohol peya bechakar dhan kamaayen
 Given this legacy, MCC continued to participate in the administration of English cricket and in 2010, Lord's was presented as the natural venue for a "home" Test match for Pakistan, a match determined by the ICC Gaya that was supposed to happen to Australia; Although the outcome of the game proved controversial, for terrorism-stricken Pakistan, it was an area of international cricket that he was not allowed to visit

 club main real tennis or squesh court, sakriy golf, brij or backgamaun socitiyaan bhi hai
 Often referred to as Quiet and Bishop, the club has improved its image in the eyes of the media and the public of late, partly because traditions are changing rapidly and partly because it has led to image reform

 The result was that humiliating opponents or saying dirty things became known as "abusive tendencies"
 yah shabdaawalee bhale hi haal hi main gadhi gai ho, lekin iskaa istemaal utana hi purana he jitna khud cricket, itihaas ke pannon main bhi khilaadiyon ke bich mazaakia baatcheet kii charchaa behad aam rahi he
 According to the bbc's Pat Murphy: "I think it started in the mid-sixties and a player named Graham Corling who started bowling for New South Wales and Australia

 " kuch yahudee cricketron ko khaas kar julian vinar or bev leone ko unke khelon ke dauraan yahudee-virdohi apshabdon ko jhelana padataa tha
 One of England's best batsmen of the 19th century, English batsman William Gilbert Grace was notorious for pinching in a funny tone
 ek baar clin bold hone ke baad unhone wicket par gilliyon ko lagaaya or kaha- "ampire aaj hawa bahut tej chal rahi he
 "the umpire replied-" Yes, rightly said, take care of your hat while going to the pavilion
 " In another incident, he was lbw, but was not ready to leave the ground
 unhone tark diya ki, "ye jo darshak aae hai ve meri ballebaaji dekhne aae hai na ki aapako gendbaaji karte dekhne
 "however perhaps the best answer to Grace's abusive tendency was given by bowler Charles Courtright
 gres ko out karne kii unki baar-baar kii koshishen naakaam hone or ampire dwaara gres ko out dene se inkaar karne se pareshaan cotrit ne aakhirkaar gres ke do viketon ko maidan par gira diya
 When Grace started returning to the pavilion with a heavy heart, Courtright said to her farewell- "doctor sir, what are you going in right? But one stump is still standing
 " West Indies batsman Viv Richards was famous for teaching a lesson to bowlers who dare to abuse themselves
 richards kaa itnaa dar tha ki kai captainon ne to apane khilaadiyon ko apshabd kehane par hi pabandi laga di thi
 However, once in a county match against Glamorgan, Greg Thomas tried to abuse Richards when he failed to hit multiple consecutive balls
 thomas ne richards se kaha tha- "agar aap hairaan hai, soch rahe hon to aapako bataa duun ki ye laal rang kii gol gend he or ye kareeb paanch ouns vajani he
 "richards hit Thomas's next ball so that he went into a nearby river outside the cricket ground
 phir gendbaaj kii ore ghoomte hue unhone kaha- "greg, chunki aap jaanate hai ki ye kis tarah dikhti he, isliye ab jaaie or use dhundh kar le aaie
 " australia main khel ke zyaadaatar staron par apshabdon kii pravriti aam he, lekin jis ek australian khilaadi ko apshabd kehane ke maamle main khaas maharath hasil thi, ve the tej gendbaaj marv huge
 His style of bullying and aggressive bowling often consisted of a mixture of witty remarks and sarcasm
 kai baar ve apshabd kehete-kehete apmaan bhi karne lagate the
 However, there have been many occasions by Hugh to say abusive words that can be called memorable
 aisa hi ek mauka tha jab huge pakistan ke ballebaaj javed miyandad ko gendbaaji kar rahe the, tab ballebaaj ne huge se kaha tha ki wo bas ke ek mote bas conductor kii tarah dikh rahe hai
 On the very next ball, Hughes bowled Miandad and ran to his fellow players to celebrate, shouting, "please buy tickets!" apshabd kehane kii ye pravriti 2007-08 main bhartiya dal ke australia daure ke dauraan media kii surkhi tab bani, jab harbhajan singh par andru symonds par kathith taur par nasleey tippanee karne ke aarope lage the
 This charge could not be proved and the ban of three matches against Harbhajan was withdrawn
 isaki jagah par unhen level 2
8 ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya gaya, jise unhone sweekaar bhi kiya or un par match shulk ke pachaas fisadi kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 However, the Appeal Commissioner later said that if he had known about Harbhajan's old behavior, then a match would have been banned
 symonds ne sweekaar kiya tha ki unhone hi do khilaadiyon ke bich aakraamak bhashaa kaa prayog kar apshabd kehane kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Although trying to divert the attention of opponents by verbally abusing is very common in almost all sports, the term "abusive tendency" has become a part of cricket in itself
 anya khelon main kai baar maukhik taur par apshabd kehane kii apni shabdaawalee hoti he
 For example, in basketball it is called rubbish and in ice hockey it is called twitter

 This is usually done with the objective of attracting media attention and gathering a large number of viewers by making the competition vigorous
