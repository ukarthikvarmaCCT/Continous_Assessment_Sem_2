 Post-war analysis revealed some expectations, it was felt that after the indo-china war, there was a greater emphasis on the amount of expansion in place of quality to meet the extremely high speed demand for Indian Air Force expansion
 adhik sankhya ke carmikon ko taiyaar karne ke liye prashikshan paathyakramon kii avadhi ko kam karnaa padaa jiskaa sankriyaatmak kushalta par vipareet asar padaa
 As a result, more emphasis was placed on quality rather than numbers and training was largely restructured

 In the indo-pak war, the importance of preparation, training and motivation of the airmen who flew the aircraft and serviced the aircraft underlined the importance of their equipment

 Thus a sufficient number of advanced mig-21fls were launched from abroad in flightable condition to begin the program, along with some other aircraft imported as compact kits, to be assembled by HAL Was, which was sufficient to re-equip 9 squadrons during the period 1966â€“69

 bhartiya vayusena beson ke atirikt, pakistani vayusena ne railway steshnon, bhartiya armar jamaav or anya lakshyon par hamalaa kiya
 In response and during the next two weeks, the Indian Air Force filled approximately 4,000 in the west and 1978 sorties in the east from major and forward bases in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan

 The main task of the Indian Air Force in the west was to disrupt the enemy's communication system, destroy the reserve of fuel and ammunition and prevent any ground forces from being collected so that it could not launch a major offensive against India

 Of course, the damage from the war was natural, but the Indian Air Force flew more flights mainly on preventive missions than the enemy and most of the preventive action of the service was made possible by anti-aircraft fire

 Ultimately, the mig-21s had to contend with their original enemy F-104 Star Fighter in an airplane over the subcontinent during the December 1971 war, and the mig-21s performed best in all four combat wars, and the F-104s were put into battle

 a king named Kubera lived in the city of Alakapuri in Swargadham
 vah shiv bhakt tha or pratidin shiv kii puja kiya karata tha
 a gardener named Hem used to bring flowers to him for worship
 hem kii vishalakshi naam kii sundar stri thi
 One day he brought a flower from Mansarovar, but due to being a Kamasakta, he started humming and humming his woman
 idhar raja uski dopaher tak raah dekhtaa rahaa
 Finally, King Kubera ordered the servants to go and find out the reason for the gardener not coming, because he has not yet brought a flower
 sevakon ne kaha ki maharaj vah paapi atikami he, apni stri ke saath hasya-vinod or raman kar rahaa hoga
 Hearing this, Kubera got angry and called him
 hem mali raja ke bhay se kaanpata hua upasthit hua
 King Kubera got angry and said- 'hey sinner! Low Kami! You have disrespected the God of my Most Worshiped God, Shri Shivji Maharaj, therefore i curse you that you will bear the disconnection of the woman and go leper in the dead
 â€™ Hem Mali fell from heaven due to Kuber's curse and he fell on the earth at that moment
 bhootal par aate hi uske sharir main shwet kodh ho gaya
 His woman also disappeared at the same time
 mrityulok main aakar mali ne mahaan du:kha bhoge, bhayanak jangal main jaakar bina ann or jal ke bhatakta rahaa
 There was no sleep in the night, but due to the effect of worshiping Shiva, he must have knowledge of the memory of previous birth
 ghoomte-kioomate ek din vah markendeya rishi ke ashram main pahunch gaya, jo brahma se bhi adhik vruddh the or jinka ashram brahma kii sabha ke samaan lagata tha
 Hem Mali went there and fell on his feet
 use dekhakar marrkandeya rishi bole tumne aisa koun-sa paap kiya he, jiske prabhaav se yah haalat ho gai
 Hem Mali heard the whole story
 yah sunakar rishi bole- nishchit hi tuune mere sammukh satya vachan kahe hai, isliye tere uddhaar ke liye main ek vrath bataata hoon
 All your sins will be destroyed if you lawfully observe the Ekadashi called Yogini of Krishna Paksha of Jyeshtha month
 yah sunakar hem mali ne atyant prasann hokar muni ko sashtaang pranaam kiya
 Muni raised him with affection
 hem mali ne muni ke kathananusaar vidhipurvak yogini ekadshi kaa vrath kiya
 Due to the effect of this fast, he came to his old form and started living happily with his woman

 The process of forming a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances automatically joining each other is called diffusion
 sajiv koshikaon main amino amla ke sanvahan main visaran kii mukhya bhoomika he
 All things, solids, liquids and gases, are made up of large microscopic particles
 sabase chote kanon ko anu kehete hai
 Molecules are constantly moving in matter
 inaki gatiyaan bahut kuch taap par bhi nirbhar karti hai
 If different items are kept together, then due to these motions they merge
 thoson ke anu ek duusare se bahut nikatataa se sate hue rahete hai
 The molecules of liquids are less contiguous than the molecules of solids
 gaison ke anu to ek duusare se paryaapt duuri par rahete hai, yahi kaaran he ki gaisen badi shighrata se ek duusare main mil jaati hai
 The molecules of liquids do not meet as quickly, and the molecules of solids meet more lately
 is prakaar padaarthon ke anuon ke paraspar mil jane ko visaran kehete hai
 Diffusion is an irreversible action, in which the concentration difference is reduced by the natural flow of substances
 yah kriya sabhi padaarthon main hoti he
 If an air filled jar is placed on a jar of chlorine gas, even if the chlorine gas is heavy, its molecules rise up by diffusion and merge into both jars and in some time they become one to one
 yadi kisi jal ke paatr main tuutiya kaa ek crystal rakh diya jaae, to pehle crystal ke nikat kaa jal tuutie ke vilyan sa ho jayega or kuch samay ke baad sara jal tuutie ke rang kaa ho jayega or kuch samay ke baad sara jal tuutie ke rang kaa ho jayega
 This is due to diffusion
 yadi sone ke ek tukade ko sis ke tukade ke sampark main rakhaa jaae, to kuch dinon ke baad sis main sona or sone main sis kii upasthiti maaloom kii ja sakati he
 Gravity does not interfere with diffusion and nor does emanation have any effect on it
 gaisen shighrata se visaran karti hai
 Light gases diffuse less quickly, due to lower density, and heavier gases, due to higher density
 is sambandh main graham ne ek niyam jo 'graham ke gas visaran ke niyam' ke naam se vikhyath he, pratipaadit kiya he
 According to this rule, the speed of diffusion at the same temperature and temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the relative density of gases
 gaison ke visaran se hamen anek bade upyogi parinaam praapt hote hai
 With this help, we can extract the relative density of some gases and atomic mass from it and separate their components by mixing some gases
 visaran se kuch gaison ke samasthanikon ke pruthakkaran main hamen safalataa mili he
 Some toxic gases are so dispersed in the air due to diffusion that their chances of loss are greatly reduced
 carbon dioxide gas kaa vaayu main ek nishchit maatra se adhik rahanaa swasthya ke liye bahut hanikaarak he
 Diffusion on the earth made of fuels etc
 and the carbon dioxide exhaled by the breath is found in all the air by diffusion so that a special difference in its ratio is not found
 koyale kii khaanon main pai janevaali daahya gas, marsh gas, visaran dwaara hi samast khaanon main fail jaati he or uske kisi ek sthaan kii vaayu ke pareekshan se iskaa pataa lag jaataa he
 Diffusion of liquids is more complicated than diffusion of gases
 inkaa visaran bahut kuch padaarthon kii prakruti par nirbhar karata he
 Diffusion is relatively easy with the increase of concentration and heat

 Gulab Rai Ji's compositions are of two types - philosophical and literary
 gulab raay ji kii darshanik rachanaayen unke gambhir adhyayan or chintan kaa parinaam he
 He first donated his philosophical ideas to Hindi
 unase purv hindi main is vishay kaa sarvatha abhaav tha
 Gulabarai ji's literary works include his critical essays
 ye aalochanatmak niabandh saidhantik or vyavhaarik donon hi prakaar ke hai
 Gulabrai ji has also promoted Hindi literature by running his writing on various topics like social, cultural, psychological etc
 gulabry ji kii bhashaa shuddh tathaa parishkrut khadi boli he
 There are mainly two forms of it - clean and simple
 vichaaratmak nibandhon kii bhashaa clisht or parishkrut hai
 It has the predominance of the corresponding words of Sanskrit, the language of affective essays is simple
 usamen hindi ke prachlit shabdon kii pradhanta he saath urdu or angrezi ke shabdon kaa bhi prayog miltaa he
 Proverbs and idioms have also been adopted
 gulabry ji kii bhashaa aadambar shunya he
 In spite of being a Sanskrit scholar, Gulab Rai did not try to perform erudition anywhere in his language
 sankshep main gulab raay ji kaa bhashaa sanyat, gambhir or pravahpurn he
 In the works of Gulab Rai Ji, we see the following styles: 1
 vivechanaatmak style- yah style gulab raay ji ke aalochanatmak tathaa vichaaratmak nibandhon main milti he
 In this style, when considering literary and philosophical subjects seriously, the sentences become relatively long and inaccurate, but where current problems, interpretations of ancient theories or interpretive criticisms of poets are presented, the sentences are simple and expressive
 is style kaa ek udhaaharan- 'rashtriya parv' kaa manaanaa kori bhavukta nahin he
 This sentimentality has value
 bhavukta main sankramakata hoti he or phir shakti kaa sanchaar karti he
 Thoughts can illustrate our condition, but the strong motivation and power of the work is contained in the emotions
 2
 bhavatmak style- gulab raay ji kii is style main vichaaron or bhaavon kaa sundar samanvay he
 This style is impressive and enjoys a prose poem
 isaki bhashaa atyant saral he
 The sentences are short and Urdu words have also been used at some places
 'nar se narayan' naamak niabandh se is style kaa ek udhaaharan- 'sitambar ke maheene main agre main pani kii traahi-traahi machi thi
 i also kept Chari 'bow' in a nearby field to maintain Vaishya religion
 jowar kii pattiyaan anth-anth kar battiyaan ban gai thim
 3
 Humor and witty style - Gulab Rai ji has also put humor and satire in the description of serious themes to overcome the drabness of his essays
 is vishay main unhone likhaa he- 'ab main praayah gambhir vishyon main bhi hasya kaa samavesh karne laga hoon
 Where there is a possibility of loss of meaning due to humor or if there is a very compassionate context, then i will avoid humor, otherwise i welcome the past humor as much as the miser or any unintended money
 ' is style main hasya kaa samavesh karne ke liye gubaab raay ji yaa to muhaavaron kaa sahaara lete hai yaa shlesh kaa
 The sentences in this style are somewhat large
 isamen urdu, farsi ke shabdon or muhaavaron kaa bhi prayog hua he
 Gulabrai ji has composed many original texts as well as edited many texts
 unki kritiyaan is prakaar hai- Critical compositions - Navaras, Subodh history of Hindi literature Hindi, Natya discourse, Criticism Kusumjani, forms of poetry, theory and study etc
 darshanasambandhi- kartavya shaastra, tark shaastra, buddha dharm, paashchaatya darshanon kaa itihaas, bhartiya samskruti kii ruparekha
 Essay collection - types Prabhakar, life-animals, tungu club, my failures, my mental contribution etc

 He has demonstrated his talent and originality in both criticism and essay fields
 hindi main sarv pratham unhone hi darshan sambandhi nibandhon kii rachana kii
 Gulab Rai Ji's essays contain the message of morality, progress for society, modesty approach, the simplest interpretation of complex theories of philosophy and sublime sense of national love
 ek moulik nibandhkaar, utkrisht samalochak evam safal sampadak ke rup main gulab raay ji ne hindi kii jo seva kii he, uske liye ve sadaiv prashansa or dhanyavad ke paatr hai
 In his honor, the Indian Post Office Department issued a stamp on 22 June 2002 valued at Rs 5 and on which Babu Gulabrai's portrait was displayed along with his three major books

 Raja Purvas or Raja Porus's kingdom extended from the Jhelum to the Chenab River in Punjab
 vartmaan lahore ke aas-paas isaki rajdhani thi
 Raja Porus was the ruler of the Porwa dynasty, whose empire stretched as far as the Jhelum and Chenab rivers in Punjab and the colony Hypasis
 poras yaa poros, pauron kaa raja tha
 Their area was between Hydaspes and Accescence which is now the territory of Punjab
 poras ne hidespesh kii ladaai main alexander great ke saath ladaai kii
 Kingdom of Porus: The empire of the great Emperor Porus was a giant
 maharaja poras sindh-punjab sahit ek bahut bade bhu-bhaag ke swami the
 The kingdom of Porus was situated between the rivers Jehlum and Chenab
 ullekhneey he ki is kshetra main rahane vaale khokhron ne rajput samraat prithviraj chouhan kii hatya kaa badla lene ke liye mohammad gori ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 Porus was noted for his bravery
 usne un sabhi ke samarthan se apane samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha jinhone khukhrayanon par uske netritv ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 When Alexander came to Hindustan and had a conflict with Porus near Jehlum, Porus had full support of the Khukraians
 is tarah poras, jo swayan sabharwal upjati kaa tha or khukhrayan jati samooh kaa ek hissaa tha, unka shaktishaalee netaa ban gaya
 -IP Anand Thapar sindhu or jhelum : sindhu or jhelum ko paar kiye bagaiyr poras ke rajya main pair rakhana mushkil tha
 King Porus was well aware of the natural condition of his region, the geography and nature of the Jhelum River
 maharaja poras sindh-punjab sahit ek bahut bade bhu-bhaag ke swami the
 Puru did not try to find out what is the secret of the power of the Yavana army? The main force of the Yavana army was its fast cavalry and agile archers riding horses
 itihaaskaar maanate hai ki puru ko apni veerta or hastisena par vishwaas tha lekin usne sikandar ko jhelum nadi paar karne se nahin roka or yahi uski bhul thi
 But historians do not know that Alexander was badly trapped after this crossing of the river Jhelum, because the river was flooded after crossing the river
 jab sikandar ne akraman kiya to uskaa gandhar-takshashila ke raja aambhi ne swaagat kiya or aambhi ne sikandar kii gupt rup se sahaayta kii
 Ambi King considered Porus his enemy
 sikandar ne poras ke paas ek sandesh bhijwaya jisamen usne poras se sikandar ke samaksh samarpan karne kii baat likhi thi, lekin poras ne tab sikandar kii adheenta sweekaar nahin
 Next page describes the war 


 jasuson or dhoorttake bal par sikandar ke sardaar yuddh jeetne ke prati purnatah vishwast the
 Alexander crossed the Jhelum with an army of greedy Ambi, an enemy of King Puru
 raja puru jisko swayan yavani 7 foot se upar kaa bataate hai, apni shaktishaalee gajasena ke saath yavani sena par tut pade
 Alexander and his soldiers were horrified by the terrible destruction of the Greeks by the army of Porus
 bharatiyon ke paas videshi ko maar bhagane kii har naagarik ke hath, shaktishaalee gajasena ke alaava kuch andekhee hathiyaar bhi the jaise saatphuta bhaalaa jisase ek hi sainik kai-kai shatru sainikon or ghode sahit ghudsavaar sainikon bhi maar gira saktaa tha
 In this war, Alexander's army got a fierce competition on the very first day
 sikandar kii sena ke kai vir sainik hataahat hue
 Despite being horrified by the Yandi chieftains, Alexander stood firm on his stubbornness and entered the battlefield between his special bodyguard and his internal defense
 koi bhi bhartiya senapati haathiyon par hone ke kaaran un tak koi khatra nahin ho saktaa tha, raja kii to baat bahut dur he
 King Puru's brother Amar killed Alexander's horse Bukiphilas with his spear and dropped Alexander to the ground
 aisa unani sena ne apane saare yudhkaal main kabhi hote hue nahin dekha tha
 Sikandar stood in front of the ground with Raja Puru sword
 sikandar bas palabar kaa mehmaan tha ki tabhi raja puru thithak gaya
 It was not feared, perhaps it was the Kshatra Dharma of the Arya King, however, then Alexander's bodyguards drove him away from there rapidly
 poras par uplabdh ekmaatr jaankaree unani sroton se he itihaaskaaron ne haalanki tark diya he ki unke naam or unke domen ke sthaan par aadhaarit poras ko rugaved main ullekith puru janajati ke vanshaj hone kii sambhaavna thi
 Historian Ishwari Prasad said that Porus could have been Yaduvanshi Shoreseni
 unhone tark diya ki poras ke mohara sainikon ne heracals kaa ek binar jise megasthanis ne dekha tha, jo poras ke baad bharat kii yatra par chandragupta dwaara mathura ke shorsaniyon ke saath spasht rup se pahachaane gaye the
 Megasthanis and Herakles of Arrian have been identified by some scholars as Krishna and by others as his elder brother Baldev, who was both the ancestor and patron deity of Shoresenis
 ishahari prasad or anya, unki aguwai ke baad, is nishkarsh kaa adhik samarthan is tathy main paaya gaya ki shorseniyon kaa ek hissaa krishna ke nidhan ke baad punjab or aadhunik afghanistan se mathura or dwarka ke liye pashchim kii ore palaayan kar rahaa tha or vahaan nae rajya sthapit kiye the
 It was difficult to set foot in the kingdom of Porus without crossing the Indus and Jhelum
 raja poras apane kshetra kii prakritik sthiti, bhugol or jhelum nadi kii prakruti se acchhee tarah waakif the
 Maharaja Porus was the owner of a very large area including sindh-punjab
 puru ne is baat kaa pataa lagane kii koshish nahin kii ki yavan sena kii shakti kaa rahasy kya he? yavan sena kaa mukhya bal uske drutagami ashwarohi tathaa ghodon par savaar furtile teerandaaj the
 Historians believe that Puru had faith in his valor and Hastisena but that did not stop Alexander from crossing the Jhelum River and that was his mistake
 lekin itihaaskaar yah nahin jaanate ki jhelum nadi ke is paar aane ke baad sikandar buree tarah funs gaya tha, kyonki nadi paar karne ke baad nadi main baadh aa gai thi
 When Alexander attacked, he was welcomed by Ambhi, the king of gandhara-taxila and Ambi secretly assisted Alexander
 aambhi raja poras ko apana dushman samajhataa tha
 Alexander sent a message to Porus, in which he wrote to Porus surrendering to Alexander, but Porus then did not accept Alexander's subjection
 agle panne par yuddh kaa varnan


 Alexander's nobles were fully confident of winning the war on the strength of spies and deceit
 raja puru ke shatru laalchee aambhi kii sena lekar sikandar ne jhelum paar kii
 Raja Puru whom the Yavni himself describes as above 7 feet, with his powerful Gajsena, broke on the Yavani army

 In the year 1885, he returned home and started teaching in Presidency College as Assistant Professor of Physics
 yahaan vah 1915 tak rahe
 At that time, Indian teachers were paid one third of the salary of British teachers
 iskaa jagadish chandra bose ne virodh kiya or bina vetan ke teen varshon tak kaam karte rahe, jisaki vajah se unki stithi kharaab ho gai or un par kaaphi karja ho gaya tha
 To repay this debt, he also had to sell his ancestral land
 chauthe varsh jagadish chandra bose kii jeet hui or unhen puraa vetan diya gaya
 Bose was also a good teacher who used large scale scientific demonstrations to teach in the classroom
 bose ke hi kuch chaatr jaise satendra nath bose aage chalakar prasiddh bhautikashastri bane
 British theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves of mathematically diverse wavelengths, but he died in 1879 before his prediction was validated
 british bhautikavid oliver loj maxwell tarangon ke astitv kaa pradarshan 1887-88 main taron ke saath unhen preshit karke kiya
 German physicist Heinrich Hertz experimented with the existence of electromagnetic waves in free space in 1888
 iske baad, loj ne hertz kaa kaam jari rakhaa or june 1894 main ek smaraneey vyaakhyaan diya or use pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya
 Lodge's work attracted the attention of scientists from various countries, including Bose of India
 bose ke microwave anusandhan kaa pehali ullekhneey pahalu yah tha ki unhone tarang dairdhya ko millimetre str par laa diya 
 They understood the loss of long wavelength light waves to study the properties of light
 1893 main, nicola testla ne pehle saarvajanik radio sanchaar kaa pradarshan kiya
 a year later, during a November 1894 public demonstration in Kolkata, Bose used a millimeter range microwave wave to fire ammunition and ring a bell
 leftinent governor sar wiliam maikenji ne kalakatta toun haul main bose kaa pradarshan dekha
 Bose wrote in a Bengali essay, 'invisible Light', "invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc
, so the message can be transmitted through light without wires
 " rus main popov ne aisa hi ek prayog kiya
 Bose's first scientific article "on the polarization of electric rays by double refractory crystals" was sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of the Lodge article
 unka doosraa lekh oktober 1895 main landan kii royal socity ko lard rele dwaara bheja gaya
 In December 1895, the London magazine electrician published Bose's article "on a new electro-polariscope"
 us samay angreji bolne vaali duniya main loj dwaara gadhe gaye shabd 'kohirar' k prayog hertz ke tarang resiver yaa detector ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The electrician immediately commented on Bose's 'coherer'
 
 angreji patrika electrician se uddhrut tippanee he: Bose planned to better his "coherer" but never thought about the patent
 bose ne apane prayog us samay kiye the jab radio ek sampark madhyam ke taur par viksit ho rahaa tha
 Bose's work on radio microwave optics was not related to radio communication, but the improvements he made and the facts he wrote about it influenced other radio inventors
 us daur main 1894 ke ant main guglielmo marconi ek radio system par kaam kar rahe the jo wireles telegraphy ke liye vishith rup dizine kiya ja rahaa tha
 By early 1896, the system was transmitting radio signals far beyond the range indicated by physics
 jagadishchandra bose pehle vaigyanik the jinhone radio tarange detect karne ke liye semiconductor jankshan kaa istemaal kya tha or is paddati main kai microwave components kii khoj kii thi
 After this, there was no research on electromagnetic waves of millimeter length for the next 50 years
 1897 main bose ne landan ke royal institushan main apane millimetre tarango par kiye hue shodh kii varnana di thi
 He used waveguides, horn antennas, die -lectric lenses, different polarizers and semiconductors with frequencies up to 60 ghz - in his research
 yah saare upkaran aaj bhi kolkata ke bose institute main maujuud hai

3 mm multibeam receiver housed in Arizona's NRAO 12 meter telescope is built on the principles of the research paper written in 1897 by Acharya Bose
 sar neville mott ko 1977 main solid state electronics main kiye apane shodhakarya ke liye nobel puraskaar mila tha
 He had said that Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose was 60 years ahead of his time
 asal main bose ne hi p - tip or n - tip semiconductor ke astitv kaa purvanumaan kiya tha
 His biggest contribution in the field of biophysics was that he showed that the stimulation of plants is transmitted through the electrical medium and not through the chemical medium
 baad main in daavon ko vaigyanik proyogo ke madhyam se sach sabit kiya gaya tha
 Acharya Bose first studied the effect of microwave on vegetative tissue
 unhone paudhon par badalte hue mausam se hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Along with this, he also studied the effect of chemical inhibitors on plants and the effect of plants on changing temperatures
 alag alag paristhitiyon main cell membrane potential ke badlaav kaa vishleshan karke ve is nattejey par pahunche kii paudhe samvedansheel hote hai ve " dard mahasoos kar sakate hai, sneh anubhav kar sakate hai ityadi "
 Bose did a comparative study of fat response on different metal and plant tissues
 unhone alag alag dhaatuo ko electrical, maikenical, rasinic or thermal tareekon ke mishran se uttejit kiya tha or koshikao or dhaatu kii pratikriya ke samaantaaon ko note kiya tha
 Bose's experiments showed a cyclic fatig reaction in simulated cells and metals
 iske saath hi jivit koshikao or dhaatuo main alag alag tarah ke uttejnaaon ke liye vishesh chakree fatig or recovery rispance kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 Acharya Bose made a graph of the electrical response of changing plants with the changing electrical stimuli, and also showed that when the plants were given poison or anesthetic, their reactions started to work and became zero later
 lekin yah pratikriya zinc dhaatu ne nahin dikhaai jab use oksalik acid ke saath treet kiya gaya
 In 1917 Jagdish Chandra Bose was conferred the title of "knight" and was soon elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London for Physical and Biology
 bose ne apana puraa shodhakarya bina kisi achche upkaran or prayogshaala ke kiya tha isaliye jagadish chandra bose ek acchhee prayogshaala banane kii soch rahe the

 This shameful defeat resulted in a huge increase in dissatisfaction against Russia's corrupt Tsar government
 1905 kii roosi kranti kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Japan's interest in China increased greatly as a result of the victory in the sino-japanese War of 1894â€“95 AD

 The most pioneering in this work was Russia, which was bent on rapidly spreading to China on one pretext
 rus kii is lolupata se japan ko badi ashanka hui
 Convinced of the power and prestige of his new friend Britain in such a situation, he challenged Russia
 rus-japan yuddh isi chunauti kaa parinaam tha
 There was intense tension between Russia and Japan to dominate many regions
 isamen manchuriya or korea ko lekar donon main ghor matbhed utpann ho gaya tha or inhi samasyaon ke kaaran donon ke bich yuddh chhidaa
 The problem of Manchuria first led to a feeling of hatred against each other in Russia and Japan, which ultimately resulted in war
 china kaa uttari pradesh 'manchuriya' kehalaata he
 This region is very rich in terms of economic resources
 koyala, loha or sona yahan prachur maatra main milte hai
 There was a natural conflict between Russia and Japan to establish dominance over such a region
 rus is pradesh ko apane prabhavakshetra main laana chahta tha or iske liye uske paas kai tarah kii yojanaayen thim
 After 1894 AD, Russia took the side of China and forced Japan to take away Japanese authority from Liaotung region by influencing Japan
 kuch samay baad rus or china main ek sandhi huin iske anusaar rus ko manchuriya main bladivostoke tak ek hajaar mile lambii rail-line bichaane kaa adhikaar praapt hua
 Port Arthur and its adjoining territory was leased to Russia for twenty-five years, and here the Russian government began fortifications to secure its warships
 port arthur prashanth mahaasaagar main rus kaa sabase bada sainik adda ban chukaa tha, is kaaran is kshetra main rus kii shakti bahut drudh ho gai thi
 Two companies were formed for the construction of the railway line at Manchuria, which was controlled by Russia

 Many Russians were coming to Manchuria to build rail lines
 in linon kii raksha ke liye rus kii ek vishaal sena bhi is pradesh main rahane lagi thi
 Japan was becoming increasingly concerned by the increasing influence of Russia in Manchuria
 vah nahin chahta tha ki is kshetra par rus kaa niyantran sthapit ho jaae
 Japan itself wanted to assert its authority over Manchuria
 japani samrajya ke vistaar ke liye yah bada hi upyukt sthaan tha
 After the sino-japanese War, this selfishness was hidden behind Japan's authority over Liaotung region
 lekin, rus ke virodh ke kaaran japan ko shimonoseki kii sandhi main sanshodhan sweekaar kar is kshetra par se apana aadhipaty uthaanaa padaa tha
 Hence, a war between Russia and Japan over the establishment of dominion over Manchuria seemed inevitable
 rus or japan ke sangharsh kaa doosraa kshetra korea tha
 After the sino-japanese War, Japan's dominance over Korea was established
 lekin, rus ke hastkshep se japan kii prabhutaa bahut had tak simit ho gai
 Nevertheless, Japan continued its efforts and was trying to maintain full control over Korea
 korea kaa raja japaniyon ke in prayaason kaa virodh kar rahaa tha
 In such a situation the Japanese soldiers attacked the palace but, the king escaped and was saved by the Russian army

 The galaxy is a spiral galaxy in shape, with a large center and several curved arms emanating from it
 hamaara saura mandal isaki shikari-hans bhujaa par sthit he
 There are between 100 billion and 400 billion stars in the galaxy and it is estimated that there will be about 50 billion planets, of which 500 million are at a distance from their stars to keep life-worthy temperatures
 san 2011 main hone vaale ek surveykshan main yah sambhaavna paayi gai ki is anumaan se adhik grah hon - is adhyayan ke anusaar akashganga main taron kii sankhya se dugane grah ho sakate hai
 Our solar system is located on the outskirts of the galaxy and is orbiting the center of the galaxy
 ise ek puri parikrama karne main lagbhag 22
5 se 25 karod varsh lag jate hai
 In Sanskrit and many other indo-aryan languages, our Galaxy is called "milky Way"
 puraanon main akashganga or prithvi par sthit ganga nadi ko ek dusre kaa joda mana jaataa tha or donon ko pavitra mana jaataa tha
 The galaxy has been called "kshir" in ancient Hindu religious texts
 bhartiya upmahadweep ke baahar bhi kai sabhyataaon ko akashganga dudhia lagi
 The word "galaxy" originates from the Greek word "gala", which also means milk
 farsi sanskrit kii hi tarah ek hind-irani bhashaa he, isliye uskaa "doodh" ke liye shabd sanskrit ke "ksheer" se miltaa-julata sajaateey shabd "sheer" he or akashganga ko "raah-e-shiri" bulaayaa jaataa he
 In English, the Milky Way is called the "milky Way", which also means "milk path"
 kuch purvi asian sabhyataaon ne "akashganga" shabd kii tarah akashganga main ek nadi dekhi
 The galaxy is called the "river of Silver" in Chinese and also "mirinae" in Korean
 akashganga ek sarpil gallexi he
 The diameter of its flat circle is about 100,000 light-years but its thickness is only 1,000 light-years
 akashganga kitni badi he iskaa anumaan is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ke agar hamaare puure saura mandal ke chakra ke kshetrafal ko ek rupee ke sikke jitna samaj liya jaae to uski tulana main akashganga kaa kshetrafal bharat kaa dedh guna hoga
 It is estimated that there are at least 1 trillion stars in the galaxy, but it is possible that the number may be up to 4 trillion
 tulana ke liye hamaari padosi gallexi andromeeda main 10 kharab taare ho sakate hai
 Andromeda also has a spiral shape
 akashganga ke chakra kii koi aisi seemaa nahin he jiske baad taare ekadam na hon, balki seemaa ke paas taron kaa ghanatv dhire-dhire kam hota jaataa he
 It has been observed that after a distance of 40,000 light years from the center, the density of stars starts decreasing rapidly
 vaigyanik iskaa kaaran abhi thik se samaj nahin paae hai
 Outside the main arms, there is a ring of stripped wires from another galaxy over a period of years, called a unicorn ring
 akashganga ke ird-gird ek gallexic sehara bhi he, jisamen taare or plasma gas kam ghanatv main maujuud he, lekin is sehre kaa aakaar akashganga kii do majalanic badal naam kii upgrahiy gallexiyon ke kaaran simit he
 Because humans are located within the circle of the galaxy, we have not been able to infer its exact shape
 ham puure akashganga ke chakra or uski bhujaaon ko dekh nahin sakate
 We get a full view of thousands of other galaxies in the sky, from which we get to know the different categories of galaxies
 akashganga kaa adhyayan karne ke baad ham keval anumaan laga sakate hai ke yah sarpil shrenee kii gallexi he
 But it is very difficult to find out how many main and how small asterisks the galaxy has
 upar se yah bhi dekha gaya he ke anya sarpil gallexiyon main bhujaayen kabhi-kabhi ajeeb dishaao main mudi hui hoti hai yaa phir vibhajit hokar upabhujaayen banati hai
 Scientists differ in the size of the arms due to these intricacies
 2008 tak mana jaataa tha ke akashganga kii chaar mukhya bhujaayen hai or kam-se-kam do choti bhujaayen hai, jinamein se ek shikari-hans bhujaa he jisapar hamaara saura mandal sthit he
 In a picture on the right, different arms are shown in different colors - 2008 main visconsin vishvavidhyalay ke robert banjamin ne apane anusandhan kaa nateeja ghoshit karte hue daawa kiya ke darasal akashganga kii keval do mukhya bhujaayen hai - parasius bhujaa or skutem-santoras bhujaa - or baaqi sari choti bhujaayen hai
 If this is true, then the size of the galaxy will be different from Andromeda and will be like a spiral galaxy named NGG 1365
 1990 ke dashak tak vaigyanik samajha karte the ke akashganga kaa ghanaa kendriya bhaag ek gole ke akar kaa he, lekin phir unhen shaq hone laga ke uskaa aakaar ek mote danda kii tarah he
 Photographs taken from the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2005 made it clear that his fears were correct: the center of the galaxy was actually a dandenoid shaped more than a sphere
 2007 main akashganga main ek "echi 1523-0901" naam ke taare kii aayu 13
2 arab saal anumaanit kii gayi, isliye akashganga kam-se-kam utana purana to he hi
 Two galaxies, called large and small magellanic clouds, are orbiting the galaxy

 Tripitak tripitak buddha dharm kaa pramukh granth he jise sabhi buddha sampradaay maanate he
 It is the oldest book of Buddhism in which the teachings of Lord Buddha are stored

 Its expansion is as follows - Tripitaka consists of 17 texts
 buddha-parampara ke anusaar tripitak teen sangitiyon se sthir hua
 It is said that after Buddha's transformation, a monk named Subhadra told his companions, "awuso, don't grieve, don't cry!" We have got rid of the Great Land
 ve hameshaa kehete rahete the- â€˜yah karo, yah mat karoâ€™
 But now we will do whatever we want
 jo nahin chahenge, nahin karenge
 '' subhadr bhikshu ke ye vachan sunakar mahakashyap sthavir ko bhay hua ki kahin saddharm kaa naash na ho jaae
 Hence, he called a consort of 500 monks at the Rajgriha for the establishment of Vinaya and Dharma
 buddha bhikshuon kii duusari sangeeti buddha-parinirvana ke 100 varsh baad vaishali main bulaai gayi
 233 years after the buddha-parinirvana, the third musical was called by Tissa Moggaliputta at the time of Emperor Ashoka in Pataliputra, in which Theravada was saved
 vartmaan tripitak vahi tripitak he jo sinhal ke raja vattagamani ke samay pratham shatabdi ke antim rup se sthir hua mana jaataa he
 The Buddhist Tripitaka is of great importance in many respects

 â€˜mahavaggâ€™ main tatkaaleen juute, asana, sawari, oshadhi, vastra, chhatari, pankhe aadi kaa ullekh he
 'chullavagg' describes the progress of the nuns
 yahan bhikshuon ke liye jo shalaka-grahan kii paddati bataai gayi he
 It is an imitation of the 'vote' custom of the then Lichchavi Republic
 us samay ke ganatantr shashan main koi prastaav pesh karne ke baad, prastaav ko duhraate hue uske vishay main teen baar tak bolne kaa avasar diya jaataa tha
 Then the decision was pronounced somewhere
 yahi paddati bhikshu sangh main sweekaar kii gayi thi
 Under the 'sutrapitak', in the long life, the worship of six famous pilgrims named Purnakassap, Makkhali Gosal, Ajit Keskambal, Pakudha Kachyan, Nigantha Natputta and Sanjay Velattiputta, the rituals of the Lichchhavis, non-religious rituals, caste-related rituals etc

 'theragatha' and 'therigatha' give the life-style of many monks and nuns who conquered great temptations and attained the title of Nirvana
 jaatakon main buddha ke purvabhavon kii kathaayen hai, jinke anek drishy sanchi, bharhut aadi ke stupon par ankit hai
 These are believed to be around 150 AD
 ye kathaayen vishwa-sahitya kii drushti se bahut mahatva kii hai or vishwa ke praayah harek kone main pahaunchi hai
 'abhidhammapitaka' describes in detail the accepted substances and their distinctions in Buddhism

 It was composed by Tismamogaliputt during the time of Emperor Ashoka
 buddha vidwaanon ne ukt tripitak kii anek vyakhyaayein aadi likhi hai, jinhen atthkatha ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Eight stories are also in Pali language
 kehete hai jab mahendra sthavir buddha shashan kii sthapana karne ke liye sinhal gayi to ve tripitak ke saath-saath unki atthakathaayen bhi lete gayi
 Thereafter, Acharya Buddhaghosha converted these Sinhala fables into Pali in the 5th century AD
 atthakathaayen ye hai- Buddhaghosha is often considered to be the originator of all these stories
 iske atirikt â€˜khuddakanikaayâ€™ ke granthon par bhi bhinn-bhinn atthakathaayen hai, jinamein jataka-atthkatha or dhammapad-atthkatha vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 In Jataka there are only stories related to the previous birth of Buddha, which cannot be understood without jataka-attraction
