 Joe Sutter was transferred from the Boeing 737 development team to manage the study for a new aircraft in 1965, which had already been given model number 747
 sater ne pan em tathaa anya airlinon ke saath, unki aavashyaktaaon ko behatar dhang se samajhane ke liye, ek dizin adhyayan aarambh kiya
 At the time it was widely believed that the 747 would eventually be replaced by a supersonic transport aircraft
 Despite sales being rejected for its passenger version, Boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be easily adapted for freight and it could remain in production

 Being an early customer and its initial involvement before formal orders were made, Pan Am succeeded in influencing the design and development of the 747 to such an extent that it remained unmatched for any one airline before and after
 antat oonche pankhons vaale siex-echeles bowing dizin kaa 747 ke liye upyog nahin kiya gaya, haalanki apni boli ke liye viksit kii gai unki praudyogikiyon kaa prabhaav hua tha
 The original design consisted of a full-length two-story torso of the aircraft, which had eight rows of eight seats and two corridors on the lower floor and seven rows of seven seats on the upper floor and a corridor
 haalanki, nikasi margon kii samasya or simit maal vahan kshamta ke kaaran is vichaar ko, 1966 main ek vyapak ek manjila dizin ke paksh main tyaag diya gaya
 The cockpit was therefore briefly placed on the second floor to include a door for loading goods into the front nose or cone; This design feature gave rise to the distinctive "bulge" of the 747

 One of the technologies that made it possible to envision making an aircraft as large as a 747 was the high-bypass turbofan engine
 Engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering twice as much power by consuming one-third less fuel than earlier turbojets

 There were only 28 months left before the delivery date to design the aircraft, which was two-thirds of the normal time

 Since Boeing did not have a large plant to manufacture this huge aircraft, they thought of building a new plant

 747 kaa vikaas ek badi chunauti thi or uske sangyojan sanyantr kaa nirmaan bhi ek vishaal upkram tha
 Boeing president William M
 Allen asked Malcolm T
 Stamper, then head of the company's turbine division, to oversee the construction of the Everett factory and start production of the 747
 More than four million cubic yards of soil had to be removed to level the site
 samay itnaa kam tha ki iske upar kaarkaane kii chat purna hone se pehle hi 747 kii purna aakaar kii pratikruti bana lee gai thi

 In subsequent tests, the target of evacuation was achieved in 90 seconds but more people were injured
 The evacuation from the top floor of the aircraft was the most problematic; Instead of using the traditional slippery, the volunteer passengers left with the help of a gene attached to a pulley
 The tests also involved driving such a large aircraft on land

 On 30 September 1968, the first 747 Everett Combination exited the building in front of representatives of the world's press and 26 airlines who ordered the aircraft
 Preparations were made for the first flight in the coming months, with Jack Waddle on the test driver's seat, Brian Weigle on control, and Jess Volick at the flight engineer station on 9 February 1969
 ek flap ke saath ek choti si samasya ke baavjood, udaan se pushti hui ki 747 ko bahut acchhee tarah sambhala gaya
 a major threat to the initial "swept-wing" jet was the 747 found to be widely immune to the "dutch-roll" phenomenon
 udaan pareekshan kaarykram ke baad ke charnon ke dauraan, spandan pareekshan ne darshaya ki kuch paristhitiyon mempankhons mendolan paaya gaya
 This difficulty was partially solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components

 The huge cost of developing the 747 and building the factory at Everett meant that Boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate
 During the final months before the delivery of the first aircraft, the company had to repeatedly request additional funds to complete the project

 On 15 January 1970, the first woman of the United States, Pat Nixon named Pan Am's first 747, Clipper Victor, at Dulles International Airport in the presence of Pan Am president Najib Halabi
 Instead of champagne, red, white and blue water was sprayed on the plane

 After attempting to attract more customers by replacing its 747's coach seats with a piano bar, American Airlines eventually transferred cargo service to its 747s and replaced them with smaller aircraft from Pan Am in 1983, Delta Airlines Also removed its 747 from service several years later

 The Boeing 747's increase in seating capacity was the result of a related study - 300
 Solutions such as plugging the plane structure and extending the upper floor over the entire length of the fuselage were rejected
 -300 kaa praarambhik naam vistaarit upree manzil ke liye 747esudi tha, uske baad 747-200 esudi, or phir 747-300 naam ke istemaal se pehle 747iudi naam rakhaa gaya tha

 However, the 747X family said unable to attract enough interest for production
 In 2001 Boeing dropped the 747X study to continue the Sonic Cruiser, after the Sonic Cruiser program was postponed, 787
 Some ideas developed for the 747X were used on the 747-400ER

 ganit kii sujh-boojh or tark-samathrya, vigyaan ke prati gahan anuraag, parampara ke prati vaigyanik drushtikon or tamaam tarah ke purvagrahon se alag hatakar sochane kii kala unhen pita kii ore se praapt hui
 While deep affection for religion and culture found by the mother, a sense of welfare of the living beings
 Positive attitude towards life, art of all religion, coexistence and respect
 Later Vinoba was considered as the spiritual heir of Gandhiji
 aaj bhi kuch log yahi kehete hai
 But this is a one-sided and one-sided analysis of Vinoba's character
 ve gandhi ji ke ‘aadhyatmik uttaradhikari’ se bahut aage, swatantra soch ke swami the
 The main thing is that Gandhi's brilliant halo could not be evaluated independently of his personality
 mahatma gandhi raajnneetik jeev the
 His spiritual consciousness was limited to the morning-evening aarti and worship
 jabaki unki dharmik-chetana unke raajnneetik kaaryakramon ke anukool or samanvyatmak thi
 There was no room for criticism and criticism
 dharm-darshan ke maamle main yun to vinoba bhi samarpan or sweekaarya-bhav rakhte the
 But whenever he got the opportunity, he explained the scriptures out of the box
 chaahe vah ‘gita pravachan’ hon yaa sant tukaraam ke abhangon par likhi gai pustak ‘santaprasad’
 isse usamen paryaapt moulikta or sahajata he
 This work could do only that which is free from anyone's intellectual halo
 ek baat yah bhi mahatma gandhi ke sanndhyi main aane se pehle hi vinoba aadhyatmik oonchai praapt kar chuke the
 Even after coming to the ashram, he used to take regular time for study and meditation
 vinoba se pehali hi mulaakaat main prabhavit hone par gandhi ji ne sahaj-man se kaha tha— Philosophy was his favorite subject
 ashram main daakhil hone ke kuch mahinon ke bheetar hi darshanashastra kii aage kii padhai ke liye unhone ek varsh kaa adhyayan avkaash liya tha
 Vinoba had two younger brothers like this, but Vinayak got the most of his mother
 bhaavnaatmak str par vinoba bhi khud ko apane pita kii apeksha maa ke adhik kareeb pate the
 The same situation was with Rukmini Bai, 'vinya' was the closest to his heart among the three sons
 ve bhajan-pujan ko samarpit rahati
 maa ke sanskaron kaa prabhaav
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon ke prati udaseenta or tyaag kii bhaavana kishoravastha main hi vinoba ke charitra kaa hissaa ban chuki thi
 The homeless corner would have made them more relaxed
 Silence would have made his conscience vocal
 He lived in the house, in the family among all, but such that even while living with everyone as if separate from him, clean and absolute
 Otherwise, to the mother, in her company
 'vinya' was much closer to his heart, his spiritual mind-building
 man ko koi uljhan ho to vahi sulajhane main madad karata
 koi aadhyatmik samasya ho to bhi vinya hi kaam aata
 yahaan tak ki yadi pati narhari bhaave bhi kuch kahen to usamen vinya kaa nirnay hi mahatvapurn hota tha
 It is not that Vinya was completely free or out of control
 parivaar kii aachaar samhita vinoba par bhi puri tarah lagu hoti thi
 Rather an incident of Vinoba's childhood
 rukmini bai ne bacchon ke liye ek niyam banaaya hua tha ki bhojan tulsi ke paughe ko pani dene ke baad hi milegaa
 vinya baahar se khelkar ghar pahunchate, bhukh se aakul-vyakul
 maa ke paas pahunchate hi kehete: Rukmini used to study the book 'das Bodh' of Samarth Guru Ramdas daily before sleeping
 Only then did she go to the bed
 It was only natural for the child to have this effect
 ve use sant gyaneshwar, tukaraam, namdev or shankaracharya kii kathaayen sunaatin
 ramayana, mahabharat kii kahaniyaan, upanishdon ke tatv gyaan ke bare main samajhaatin
 sanyas unki bhaawanaaon par savaar rahata
 lekin duniya se bhaagane ke bajaay logon se judane par ve jor deteen
 sansar se bhaagane ke bajaay usko badalane kaa aagrah karatin
 aksar kahatee—‘vinya, grihasthashram kaa bhalee-bhaanti paalan karne se pitaron ko mukti milti he
 'but on Vinya, the ghost of Guru Ramdas, Saint Dnyaneshwar and Shankaracharya used to ride
 All these Mahatmas boycotted their parents and family at a very young age for their spiritual fulfillment
 ve kehete— If there was another mother, she would have been shaken
 From the point of view, the sky would have lifted up on the head
 Because the general trend of people has become that renunciation, renunciation is a good thing, a matter of greatness, but only when renunciation and recluse are in the other's house
 Everyone wants to live a simple worldly life in their home
 magar rukmini bai to jaise kisi or hi mitti kii bani thim
 She lovingly explains to the son- betaa maa ke kahe ko aatmsaat karne kaa prayaas kar hi rahaa hota ki ve aage jod deteen- Vinoba was very intelligent in childhood
 Mathematics was his favorite subject
 kavita or aadhyatm chetana ke sanskaar maa se mili
 From them, the feeling of seeing both Root and Chetan with equal vision awakened
 Mother was very educated
 par unhone kii vinya ko aparigrah, astey ke bare main apane aacharan se bataaya
 While living in the world, taught him to be detached
 The mother's only effect was that Vinya would compose poetry and would burn them
 When everything in the world is temporary and fleeting, if nothing goes together then why should you be fascinated with your creation
 His mother would see all this, think, but say nothing
 As if she is preparing Vinya for the biggest sacrifice
 Vinoba's mathematical proficiency and his arguments were not hampered by his spiritual belief
 yadi kabhi donon ke bich spardhaa hoti bhi to jeet aadhyatmik vishwaas kii hi hoti
 aaj ve ghatnaayen maa-bete ke aapasi sneh-anuraag or vishwaas kaa aitihaasik dastavej hai
 Rukmini Bai used to donate one lakh grains of rice every month
 ek lakh kii ginati karnaa bhi aasaan na tha, so ve puure maheene ek-ek chaaval ginati rahati
 narhari bhaave patni ko chaaval ginate main shram karte dekh muskaraate
 kam umr main hi aankh kamjor pad jane se dar sataane lagata
 unki ganit buddhi kuch or hi kahati
 so ek din unhone rukmini bai ko tok hi diya—‘is tarah ek-ek chaaval ginaney main samay jaaya karne kii jarurat hi kya he
 Take a loaf of rice
 Count them Then take out the weight of one lakh rice from it and weigh it
 If there is no shortage, then put a few fists from above
 It was argued
 loukik samajhadaari bhi isi main thi ki jab bhi sambhav ho, duusare jaruri kaaryon ke liye samay kii bachat kii jaae
 rukmini bai ko pati kaa tark samaj to aata
 par man na maanata
 ek din unhone apni duvidha vinya ke saamne prakat karne ke baad poocha— The son heard everything, thought
 bolaa, ‘maa, pita ji ke tark main dam he
 This is what mathematics says
 kintu daan ke liye chaaval ginana sirf ginati karnaa nahin he
 While counting, we not only take the name of God with every rice, but our mind is also attached to it
 ’ ishwar ke naam par daan ke liye chaaval ginana bhi ek sadhana he, rukmini bai ne aisa pehle kahaan sochaa tha
 Rukmini Bai, who is fully immersed in Adhyatmarasas, liked the things of 'vinya'
 He used to be proud of his son
 He did not stop counting the rice even further
 Nor did his mind ever awaken to futility
 aisi hi ek or ghatana he
 Which shows how Vinoba Corey discovered metaphysics in mathematical calculations
 ghatana us samay kii he jab ve gandhi ji ke ashram main pravesh kar chuke the tathaa unke rachanaatmak kaaryon main bad-chadhakar hissaa le rahe the
 Prayer meetings take place in the ashram in the morning and evening
 The ashram dwellers who attend them are regularly counted
 This responsibility was a worker
 prasang yah he ki ek din prarthana sabha ke baad jab us kaaryakarta ne prarthana main upasthit hue aagantukon kii sankhya bataai to vinoba jhat se pratwaad karte hue bole— The worker believed in his count, so he too stood firm
 karm man vishwaas rakhane vaale vinoba aamtaur par bahes main padane se bachate the
 But on that day too, they were adamant
 ashram main vivaadon kaa niptaan baapu kii adaalat main hota tha
 Gandhiji believed in his worker
 magar jaanate the ki vinoba yun hi bahes main nahin padane vaale
 vaastaviktaa jaanane ke liye unhone vinoba kii ore dekha
 tab vinoba ne kaha—‘prarthana main sammilit shraddhaluon kii sankhya jitani inhone bataai usase ek kam hi thi
 ' 'how?' 'because a man's full attention was focused on counting the gentlemen present there
 ’ gandhiji vinoba kaa tark samaj gaye
 What is the need of accounts and appearances in the work of prayer
 Further, the work of counting the people who came to the prayer meeting was stopped
 yuvavastha ke praarambhik daur main hi vinoba aajanm brahmacharee rahane kii thaan chuke the
 The same great men were his ideals who had asceticism in childhood to seek truth
 or jab sanyas dhaaran kar brahmacharee bananaa he, grihasth jivan se naata hi todna he to kyon na man ko usee ke anuroop taiyaar kiya jaae
 kyon ulajhaa jaae sambandhon kii mithi door, sansaarik pralobhanon main
 brahmacharya kii to pehali shart yahi he ki man ko bhatakane se roka jaae
 vaasanaon par niyantran rahe
 Someone had told Kishore Vinayak that Brahmachari should not attend any wedding feast
 ve aise kaaryakramon main jane se aksar bachate bhi the
 Father Narhari Bhave was there, if anyone else had known, the younger brother would have gone
 Vinoba's body was weak
 bachapan se hi koi na koi vyaadhi lagi rahati
 magar man-mastishk puri tarah chaitanya
 maano sharir kii sari shaktiyaan simatakar dimag main samaa gai haa
 smriti vilakshan thi
 Kishore Vinayak had well memorized hundreds of verses of saints Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Namdev along with the Vedas, Upanishads
 gita unhen bachapan se hi kanthsth thi
 Later on, forty thousand verses were also well rumored in his mind
 vinayak kii badi bahan kaa vivaah tay hua to maano pariksha kii ghadi bhi kareeb aa gai
 He decided that he would stay away from the feast on the occasion of marriage
 No one should interrupt, so they announced to keep fast that day
 bahan ke vivaah main bhai upwas rakhe, yah bhi uchit na tha
 Father got angry on hearing this
 magar maa ne baat sambhaal lee
 He persuaded the son to eat simple 'dal-bhat'
 yahi nahin apane haathon se alag pakaakar bhi diya
 Married to grandeur
 vinayak ne khushi-khushi usamen hissaa liya
 But i had to live only for my mother with specially made pulses
 maa-bete kaa yah prem aage bhi bana rahaa
 Later, when he left home to retire, he carried a red-edged dhoti of mother and a statue from their worship house
 murti to unhone duusare ko bhent kar di thi
 But the mother's dhoti would carry with her wherever she went
 While sleeping, keeping the headrest
 Like walking around with mother's blessings
 Even the ascetic could not escape the memory of his mother
 maa ke sanskaar hi vinoba kii aadhyatmik chetana kii neenv bane
 His biography developed on him
 aage chalakar unhone rachanaatmakataa or aadhyatm ke kshetra main jo khyaati arjeet kii uske mul main bhi maa kii hi preranaayen thim
 Rukmini Bai was less educated
 sanskrit samaj nahin aati thim
 But the mind was that there was a longing for Gita and knowledge
 One day the mother put her difficulty before the son- vinoba dharmik sanskaron main paakhand ke virdohi the
 At the time of his mother's death, Vinoba had differences with his father and brothers
 vinoba brahmanon ke haath se paramparaagat tareeke se dah-sanskaar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 But in front of the family's insistence, they did not do one
 Vinoba too stood firm on his principles
 nateeja yah ki jis maa ko ve sabase adhik chaahate the, jo unki aadhyatmik guru thim, unke antim sanskaar se ve dur hi rahe
 He bid farewell to the mother with silent eyes
 aage chalakar 29 oktober 1947 ko vinoba ke pita kaa nidhan hua to unhone vedon ke nirdesh ki ‘mitti par mitti kaa hi adhikaar he’ kaa paalan karte hue unki deh ko agni-samarpit karne ke bajaay, mitti main dabaane jor diya
 By then Vinoba saints had become Vinoba
 gandhi ji kaa unhen aashirwad tha
 So this time they did it
 maa kii gita main aasthaa thi
 She was entrusted with the task of translating Geeta into Marathi to Vinoba
 vinoba us kaary main manoyog se lage the
 Finally the translation work is complete
 pustak kaa naam rakhaa gaya- gitai
 gita+ai = gitai
 maharashtra main ‘ai’ kaa abhipraay ‘maa ke prati’ se he; yani maa kii smriti uske neh se judi-rachi gita
 putr kii kriti ko dekhne ke liye to rukmini bai jivit nahin thim
 But Geetai, associated with his memory and desire, started getting mired in the grief of mothers and sisters from house to house in Maharashtra
 unki aadhyatm chetana kaa aabhushan ban gai
 When Gandhiji listened, he praised the translation work
 jo mahilaayein sanskrit nahin jaanati thim, jinhen apni bhashaa kaa bhi aadha-adhuraa gyaan tha, unke liye sahaj-saral bhashaa main rachi gai ‘gitai’, gita kii aadhyatmikta main doobane ke liye vardaan ban gai
 Vinoba's rites received from his mother in his childhood continued to get thicker in his youth
 yuvavastha kii ore badhate hue vinoba na to sant gyaneshwar ko bhula paae the, na tukaraam ko
 That was his ideal
 sant tukaraam ke abhang to ve bade hi manoyog se gaate
 unka apane aradhy se ladanaa-jhagadna, naaraaz hokar gaali dena, ruuthana-manaanaa unhen bahut acha lagata
 sant ramdaas kaa jivan bhi unhen prerana detaa
 ve na shankaracharya ko vismrit kar paae the, na unke sanyas ko
 Darshan was his favorite subject
 himalay jab se hosh sambhala tha, tabhi se unki sapanom main aata tha or ve kalpana main swayan ko satya kii khoj main gahan kandaraon main tap-sadhana karte hue pate
 vahaan kii nirjan, varf se dhaki deergh-gahan kandaraon main unhen paramasatya kii khoj main leen ho jane ke liye uksaatin
 In 1915 he passed the High School examination
 ab aage kya padhaa jaae
 vaigyanik pravriti ke pita or aadhyatm main dubi rahane vaali maa kaa vaicharik dwandv vahaan bhi alag-alag dhaaraon main prakat hua
 Father said - 'read French
' Mother said - 'brahmin's son should not read Sanskrit, how is it possible!' Vinoba kept the mind of both of them
 inter main french ko chunaa
 He continued to study Sanskrit at a personal level
 un dinon french gyaan-vigyaan ke kshetra main ho rahi kranti kii bhashaa thi
 All the transformative literature was being created in it
 duusari ore baroda kaa pustkaalay durlabh pustakon, pandulipiyon ke khajaane ke liye puure desh main prasiddh tha
 Vinoba made that library his second destination
 vidhyalay se jaise hi chuttee milti, ve pustkaalay main jaakar adhyayan main dub jate
 francisi sahitya ne vinoba kaa parichay pashchimi deshon main ho rahi vaicharik kranti se karaayaa
 sanskrit ke gyaan ne unhen vedon or upanishdon main gaharaai se paithne kii yogyata di
 If the level of knowledge increased, then his ardor also increased
 But the attraction of the Himalayas from the mind, the practice of renunciation, did not go away
 un dinon inter kii pariksha ke liye mumbai janaa padataa tha
 Vinoba also boarded a train going to Mumbai on 25 March 1916 as per schedule
 At that time, his mind was turbulent
 puraa vishwaas tha ki hiskool kii tarah inter kii pariksha bhi paas kar hi lenge
 magar uske baad kya? kya yahi unke jivan kaa lakshya he? vinoba ko lag rahaa tha ki apane jivan main ve jo chaahate hai, vah aupchaarik adhyayan dwaara sambhav nahin
 The certificates of the school and the degrees of the college are not his intention
 railgadee apni gati se bhaag rahi thi
 Vinoba's mind was running faster than him
 After all, victory was of the mind
 jaise hi gaadi surat pahunchi, vinoba usase neeche utar aae
 The car moved forward but Vinoba's mind went on pulling to the other side
 duusare platform par purv kii ore jane vaali railgadee maujuud thi
 Vinoba felt that the Himalayas were once again inviting him
 grihasth jivan yaa sanyas
 man main kuch der tak sangharsh chalaa
 uhapoh se guzarate hue unhone unhone nirnay liya or usee gaadi main savaar ho gaye
 The Saints set out on their favorite journey
 Unaware of the fact that this time also the journey for which they have set out, is not their real journey, but only a halt
 jivan se palaayan unki niyati nahin
 He has to emerge as a hope for the lives of millions and millions of Indians
 brahm kii khoj, satya kii khoj, sanyas lene kii saadh main vinoba bhatak rahe the
 He left home with the same goal
 himalay kii ore yatra jari thi
 Kashi came to a halt in the middle
 mithkon ke anusaar bhagwaan shankar kii nagari
 hajaaron varshon tak dharm-darshan kaa centre rahi kaashi
 sadhu-santon or vichaarkon kaa kumbh
 jigyaasuon or gyaan-pipaasuon ko apni ore aakarshith karne vaali pavitra dharmasthali
 shankaracharya tak khud ko kaashi-yatra ke pralobhan se nahin roak paae the
 At the Ganga Ghat in Kashi, where new ideas flourish, Vittanda was also composed countless times
 usee ganga tat par vinoba bhatak rahe the
 Looking for a destination for yourself
 In search of a Guru who can show them the way forward
 jis lakshya ke liye unhone ghar choda tha, us lakshya tak pahunchane kaa maarg bataa sake
 While wandering, they reached a place where some truth-seekers were discussing
 vishay tha advait or dwait main koun sahi
 prashn kaaphi purana tha
 About twelve hundred years ago, there was a decisive debate on this
 shankaracharya or mandan mishra ke bich
 us aitihaasik bahes main dwaitvaadi mandan mishra or unki patni ko shankaracharya ne parajeet kiya tha
 The same subject was again caught between those truth-seekers
 yaa kaho ki vakt kaatane ke liye donon paksh apane-apane tarkon ke saath vitanda rach rahe the
 And then, leading the debate to a conclusion, it was suddenly announced that the monotheist had won
 vinoba chanke
 unki hansi chhot gai— On the one hand Vinoba was wandering on the ghats, in the streets of Kashi, seeking solace, in the practice of renunciation
 vahiin duusari ore ek or jigyaasu bharat ko jaanane, uske hridaypradesh kii dhadakanon ko pahchaanane, usase atmiyata bharaa rishta kaayam karne ke liye bharat-bhraman par niklaa hua hua tha
 He returned from South Africa a few months ago after gaining immense fame
 aage uski yojana bhartiya raajnneeti main dakhal dene kii thi
 The name of that seeker was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
 At the behest of his political mentor, Govind Ballabh Pant, he set out on a year-long tour of India for the purpose of knowing the soul of India
 aage chalakar bhartiya raajnneeti par chaa jane, karodon bharatiyon ke dil kii dhadkan, bhartiya swadhinata andolan kaa pramukh sutaradhar, ahimsak senaanee ban jane vaale gandhi un dinon aprasiddh hi the
 The title of 'mahatma' was also far from them
 sirf dakshin africa main chhede gaye andolan kii puunji hi unke saath thi
 Because of that he was known all over India
 un dinon unka padaav bhi kaashi hi tha
 It was as if time was playing its magic game to introduce two great souls
 kaashi main mahaamanaa madan mohan malviya dwaara sthapit hindu vishvavidhyalay main ek bada jalsa ho rahaa tha
 On February 4, 1916, raje-maharaja, Nabav, Samant were all present in the procession
 sammelan kii chata dekhte hi banati thi
 Gandhi gave a historic speech at that conference
 vah kaha jisaki us samay koi ummid nahin kar saktaa tha
 In time, Gandhi ji openly criticized the king and feudal lords, who were well-to-do by the British themselves, whose donations were run by Kashi University and other institutions, and said that Gandhiji should use his wealth for the nation building
 
 usko garibon ke kalyaan main lagaaein
 unhone awahn kiya ki ve vyapak lokhit main apane saare aabhushan daan kar den
 She had a revolutionary appeal
 sabha main khalabali much gai
 But Gandhi's smile remained the same
 agle din us sammelan kii khabaron se akhbaar range pade the
 Vinoba learned about Gandhiji only through the newspaper
 And they felt that the goal they had left home in search of was fulfilled
 vinoba kori shanti kii talash main hi ghar se nahin nikle the
 Neither were they unfamiliar with the situation in the country and the inhuman atrocities being committed by the British
 magar koi raah mil hi nahin rahi thi
 After reading the speech, he felt that this person has peace as well as revolution
 He wrote a letter to Gandhiji from there
 Answer came
 gandhi ji ke aamantran ke saath
 vinoba to uski pratiksha kar hi rahe the
 He immediately left for the Cochrab Ashram in Ahmedabad, where Gandhiji had his ashram
 7 june 1916 ko vinoba kii gandhi se pehali bhent hui
 After that Vinoba remained as Gandhiji
 gandhi ji ne bhi vinoba kii pratibha ko pahchaan liya tha
 So his comment after the first meeting was that most people come here to get something, this is the first person who came to give something
 ’ kaaphi din baad apni pehali bhent ko yaad karte hue vinoba ne kaha tha— The meeting between Gandhi and Vinoba was revolutionary
 gandhi ji ko jaise hi pataa chalaa ki vinoba apane mata-pita ko bina bataae aae hai, unhone vahiin se vinoba ke pita ke naam ek patr likhaa ki vinoba unke saath surakshit hai
 After that their relationship continued to deepen
 vinoba ne khud ko gandhi ji ke ashram ke liye samarpit kar diya
 From studies, teaching, spinning, farming work to community life, he was ahead in every activity of the ashram
 Gandhiji's statement that this young man has come to take nothing from the ashram residents but to give it was becoming true
 umr se ekadam yuva vinoba unhen anushaasan or kartavyaparayanata kaa paath to padhaa hi rahe the
 Gandhiji's influence was growing rapidly
 utani hi teji se bad rahi ashram main aane vaale kaaryakartaaon kii sankhya
 kocharab ashram chota padane laga to ahmedabad main sabarmati ke kinare nae ashram kaa kaam teji se hone laga
 lekin aazaadee ke ahimsak sainik taiyaar karne kaa kaam akele sabarmati ashram se bhi sambhav bhi na tha
 Gandhi also wanted the same ashram in Wardha
 vahaan par aise anushaasit kaaryakarta kii aavashyaktaa thi, jo ashram ko gandhi ji ke aadarshon ke anuroop chalaa sake
 iske liye vinoba sarvatha anukool paatr the or gandhi ji ke vishwasaneey bhi
 8 april 1923 ko vinoba wardha ke liye prasthaan kar gaye
 There he started editing the 'maharashtra Dharma' monthly
 marathi main prakashit hone vaali is patrika main vinoba ne niyamit rup se upanishdon or maharashtra ke santon par likhnaa aarambh kar diya, jinke kaaran desh main bhakthi andolan kii shuruyaat hui thi
 The magazine gained unexpected popularity, shortly after that it had to be weekly, Vinoba was still known as Gandhiji's disciple and satyagrahi
 patrika ke madhyam se janata unki aadhyatmik paith ko jaanane lagi thi
 At the time of World War II, the United Kingdom was being forced into a war by the United Kingdom against which a personal satyagraha was started on 17 October 1940 and Vinoba was made the first Satyagrahi by Gandhiji
 apana satyagrah shuru karne se pehle apane vichaar spasht karte hue vinoba ne ek vaktavy jari kiya tha
 It said that aage unhone itnaa or kaha - In his speeches Vinoba used to tell the people that through negative programs neither peace can be established nor war can be ended
 yuddh rugn maansikta kaa nateeja he or iske liye rachanaatmak kaaryakramon kii jarurat hoti he
 Not only the people of Europe, but the entire human race should take the responsibility
 sitambar,1951 main ke
pi
mashruvala kii pustak gandhi or marks prakashit hui or vinoba ne isaki bhoomika likhi
 In this, Vinoba showed great respect for Marx
 karl marks ko unhone vichaarak mana tha
 a thinker who had genuine sympathy for the poor
 vaise to marks ki soch main vinoba ko khot dikhi thi or lakshya par pahunchane ke tareeke ko lekar marks se unhone apana matbhed vyakt kiya
 Vinoba believed that communists arose because of the rich people
 vinoba kaa viswas tha ki har baat main barabari kaa siddhant lagu hona chahie
 He had said: Police action cannot be helpful to end the terror of communists
 isko jad se samaapt kiya jaae
 No matter how confused they may be, Vinoba did not consider the Communists to be destroyers and by arguing with them and expressing active sympathy for their aims, Vinoba wanted them on the right path
 bisiyon bhashaaon ke gyaata vinoba ji devanagari ko vishwa lipi ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate the
 For India, he favored developing Devanagari as a contact script
 ve kehete the ki main nahin kahata ki nagari hi chale, balki main chahta hum ki nagari bhi chale
 Inspired by his ideas, Nagari script Sangam has been established which works to use and spread Devanagari within India and outside India
 vistrut jaankaree ke liye nagari evam bhartiya bhashaayen padhen
 Vinobaji was always a social and creative activist
 swatantrata ke purv gandhiji ke rachaanatmak kaaryon main sakriy rup se yogadan dete rahe
 His health started deteriorating due to work, he was advised by a doctor to go to a hill station
 at: 1937 i0 main vinoba bhaave pawanaar ashram main gayi
 Since then, this has been the central place to start his creative work throughout his life
 rachaanatmak kaaryon ke atiritk ve mahaan swatantraaa senaanee bhi the
 He was imprisoned in the Nagpur Flag Satyagraha
 1937 main gandhiji jab landan kii golmes conference se khaali haath lote to jalgaanv main vinoba bhaave ne ek sabha main angrejon kii aalochana kii to unhen bandi banaakar chah maah kii sajaa di gayi
 After being freed from prison, Gandhiji made him the first Satyagrahi
 17 oktober 1940 ko vinoba bhavaji ne satyagrah kiya or ve bandi banaaye gayi tathaa unhen 3 varsh ke liye sashram karawas kaa dand mila
 Gandhiji consulted Vinobaji in 1942 before leaving India
 nagaland bharat kaa ek uttar purvi rajya he
 Its capital is Kohima, while Dimapur is the largest city in the state
 nagaland kii seemaa pashchim main assam se, uttar main arunachal pradesh se, purv me burma se or dakshin me manipur se milti he
 According to the 2011 census of India, it has an area of 16,579 square kilometers, and a population of 19,80,602, making it one of the smallest states in India
 nagaland rajya main kul 16 janajatiyaan nivas karti hai

 English is the official language of the state
 yah shiksha kii bhashaa bhi he, or adhikansh nivaasiyon dwaara boli jaati he
 Nagaland is one of the three states in India where followers of Christianity form the majority of the population
 rajya ne 1950 ke dashak main vidroh or saath hi antar-jaateey sangharsh dekha he
 Violence and insecurity limited Nagaland's economic development, as it had to commit its scarce resources to law, order and security
 haalanki pichley dedh dashakon main, rajya main hinsa kaaphi kam hui he, jisase rajya kii vaarshik aarthik vikaas dar 10% ke kareeb pahunchi he, or yah purvottar kshetra main sabase tezi se viksit ho rahaa rajya ban paaya he
 Nagaland was established on 1 December 1963 as the 16th state of India

 Tulsi Comics was an Indian comics publisher company in the past 80's, 90's and early 2000's, which used to be part of Tulsi Pocket Books

 On the other hand, the other reason for the failure of Tulsi comics has been to present their own produced stories in 2-3 parts, and they do not complete most single issue stories either
 vahiin un dinon ke pathakon main, jinamein adhiktar bal varg ke the unki jebkharchi bhi behad simit hoti thi, or lagbhag isi ke ulat asar se, pathak virgon ke bich apni lokapriyata khone lagi thi

 Immunofluorescence is a technique that is used with fluorescence microscopes for light microscopes and is used predominantly on biological samples
 yah takanic ek koshika ke bheetar lakshith vishesh biomolicul ko fluoroscent ranjak ko lakshith karne ke liye apane antigen ke liye pratirakshiyon kii vishistataa kaa upyog karata he or isliye namoonay ke madhyam se lakshya anu vitaran ko dekhnaa sambhav banaata he
 Attempts have also been made in epitope mapping because multiple antibodies can bind to the same epitope and different levels of affinity between antibodies that can recognize the same epitope
 iske atirikt, florophor kaa antibody ke saath judana antibody kii pratiraksha vishistataa yaa iske antigen se judane kii kshamta main hastkshep nahin kar saktaa he
 Immunofluorescence is a widely used example of immunostaining and is a typical example of immunohistochemistry that uses fluorophores to visualize the status of antibodies
 immunofloresence ko utak virgon, culture kiye hue koshika rekhaon, yaa vyaktigat koshikaon par upyog kiya jaataa he or iskaa upyog protein, glaikan or chote jaivik or gaiyr jaivik anuon ke vitaran kaa vishleshan karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 If the topology of the cell membrane has not yet been determined, epitope insertion into the protein can be used in conjunction with immunofluorescence to determine the structures
 immunofloresence kaa upyog diene mithailikaran ke str or sthaniyakaran pattern main antardrushti praapt karne ke liye "ardh-maatraatmak" vidhi ke rup main bhi kiya ja saktaa he kyonki yah vaastavik maatraatmak tareekon se adhik samay lene vaali vidhi he or mithailikaran ke str ke vishleshan main kuch vyaktiparakta he
 Immunofluorescence can be used in combination with other non-antibodies to fluorescent staining
 udhaaharan ke liye, diene ko label karne ke liye DAPI kaa upyog karke
 immunofloresence ke namoonon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye kai sookshmdarshi diginon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he; inamen se sabase saral he epifloresence sookshmdarshi or confocal sookshmdarshi hameshaa vyapak rup se prayog kii jaati he
 Various super-resolution microscope designs that are capable of producing even higher results can also be used
 immunofloresence takanic ke do varg hote hai, praathmik or dwitiyak 
 Primary, or direct, immunofluorescence uses a single antibody that is chemically linked with a fluorophore
 yah pratirakshi lakshya anu ko pahachaanata he or use baandhta he or ek sookshmdarshi ke madhyam se usamen maujuud florophore kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This technique has several advantages over the following secondary protocols, due to the direct combination of antibodies with fluorophore
 This reduces many stages of the staining process and is therefore rapid and can avoid some issues with antagonistic antagonism or non-specificity, which leads to an increase in background signal
 dwitiyak, yaa apratyaksh, immunofloresence do pratirakshiyon kaa upyog karata he, pehla jo lakshya anu ko pahachaanata he or usase bandhata he or doosraa, jo florophore ko vahan karata he, praathmik pratirakshi kii pahchaan karata he or usase bandhata he
 This protocol is more complex than the above primary and takes longer but provides more flexibility
 yah protocol isliye sambhav he kyonki ek pratirakshi main do bhaag hote hai, ek parivartaneey kshetra or ek aparivartaneey kshetra 
 a researcher can produce several primary antibodies that identify different antigens, but all share the same irreversible region
 isliye yah sabhi pratirakshi ek ekal dwitiyak pratirakshi dwaara pahchaan liye jate hai
 This saves the cost of modifying the primary antibody to directly carry a fluorophore
 aparivartaneey kshetron vaale vibhinn praathmik pratirakshi aam taur par alag-alag prajatiyon main pratirakshi ko ugane ke dwaara utpann hote hai
 For example, a researcher may produce a primary antibody in a goat that identifies multiple antigens and then include a secondary antibody to a dye-coupled rabbit that identifies the immune-invasive region of the goat
 shodhakarta tab ek chuuhe main praathmik pratirakshi kaa ek doosraa set taiyaar karte hai jise ek alag "gadhaa gaiyr-chuha" dwitiyak pratirakshi dwaara pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 This makes re-use of dye-coupled antibodies difficult to make in many trials
 jaisaa kii adhikansh pratidipti takneekon ke maamle main he, immunofloresence ke saath ek mahatvapurn samasya photobleaching he
 The loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing the intensity or time span of light exposure, increasing the density of fluorophores, or by using more solid fluorophores less sensitive to bleaching
 saamanytah, immunofloresence nishchit namoonay tak simit hai
 Analysis of the structure within living cells by immunofluorescence is not possible, since the antibodies cannot cross the cell membrane
 Some uses of immunofluorescence, however, were rendered obsolete by the development of recombinant proteins containing fluorescent protein domains, for example green fluorescence proteins
 is tarah ke "tag kiye hue" protein kaa istemaal jivit koshikaon main unke sthaniyakaran ko nirdhaarit karne ko sambhav karata he

 This metal is rarely found in the upper surfaces of the earth
 paaya gaya ki kai shilaon kii ke-piji seemaa main ausat se 30 guna se lekar 120 guna iridium kaa jamaavada upasthit tha
 There is no known reason for this assemblage to be born on the earth itself because iridium is an element attracted to iron, so most of its quantity went to the center of being attracted by the iron present in the core at the time of earth's construction
 lekin is se miltaa-julata iridium sankendran kai kshudragrahon main miltaa he
 Scientists estimated the amount of iridium inhabiting the K-PG range of the entire world and calculated that the asteroid that struck it to bring it to Earth must have been at least 10 km, and its strike hit 10 nil tons of TNT
 Must have exploded loudly

 The evidence for this theory of Alvarez's comet collision also appears to be correct, given that the enormous amount of iridium found in the chondrite, meteorite, and asteroids, which is approximately ~ 455 degrees per billion, is found in the upper layers of the Earth at ~ 0
3 The share is much more than per billion

 The editor of the HTML5 specification Ian Hixon hopes that these specifications will reach Candidate Recommendation Level during 2012
 The following criteria are required for these specifications to become W3C recommendations - "two 100% complete and fully interconnected implementations"
 In an interview with techpublic, Hixon speculates that this will likely happen in the year 2022 or later
 However, many parts of the specification are static and can be implemented in products: Some sections are already relatively stable and there are implementations that are already quite close to completion, and those features can be used today
