 baharhaal, maanav basti ke adhikansh avasheshon ko marusthal kii ret dwaara dafan kar diya gaya or bade paimaane par sadiyon se yah kshetra viraan rahaa
 In early 1923, a family of Al Dosari tribe and several families of Hovela settled here in Ad Dammam
 in pariwaron kaa netritv shaikh ahamed ebn abdullah ebn hasan al dosari karata tha jo bahrain se aayaa tha or in pariwaron ko echarem swargeey raja abdulajiz dwaara basane ke liye bhoomi chunane kaa mauka diya gaya
 Soon Ad Dammam was chosen to see that the island of Bahrain was close by and the clan was expected to return there soon, but as British rule was established in the region, it was very important for them to do so It became difficult and eventually he realized that it would be better for him to settle there permanently
 kai saal baad, shaikh ahamed kaa bhai dakshin chalaa gaya jahaan vah or uskaa parivaar al khobar main bas gaye jo ki us samay pehle se hi basaa hua tha
 This small episode, however, boosted the population in Khobar and led to closer ties with the big city of Dammam
 "dammam" kaa mul naam vivaadaaspad he, kuch logon kaa kahana he ki yah dhwani anukaranaatmak he or is ilaake ke nazadik hi ek drum rakhe hone ke kaaran is kshetra ko yah naam diya gaya, jab ise chetavanee ke liye bajaay jaataa tha to isse ek madhur dhwani nikalati thi jise "damdamah" kehete the, anya logon kaa maananaa he ki is naam ko arabi shabd "davama" ke aadhaar par rakhaa gaya he, jo paas ke ek samudri sthal ko ingit karata tha jisase dho logon ko aksar bachanaa hota tha
 When the modern state of Saudi Arabia was established in 1932, the life of many settlements in the region depended on fishing and pearling

 New oil fields in the south, west and north of Dammam were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s, now known for a quarter of the world's proven oil reserves, and which encouraged building construction in response
 is desh or duniya bhar se visheshgy or takanisian nae tel ke kshetron kii khoj main madad karne ke liye or unhen dhara par laane ke liye ekatra hue

 The increasing number of specialists working in Dhahran required housing, construction of hospitals, schools for their children and other facilities
 bina adhik antaraal ke, dahraan, saudi aramko kaa korporate mukhyalay jo duniya main sabase badi tel company thi, registan main sabhi dishaao main failane lagi
 The development of the oil industry in the region had similar effects on the small fishing villages of Dammam and the village of Al Khobar
 Within two decades of the discovery of oil, the mud houses of fishermen mostly built on the seabed and which were the only permanent dwellings in the area, soon turned into concrete buildings, modern dwellings, highways and orchard paths
 parasian gulf tat par dahraan ke purv main sthit al khobar sankshipt rup se saudi arab ke kachche tel ke liye bahrain main rifinary kaa ek shipping kendra ban gaya
 In the early years of World War II, oil production in Saudi Arabia was very limited and as the company had no refinery of its own, most of the oil was sent to Bahrain by small tankers

 The Bharatpur kingdom of Badan Singh emerged from the ashes of Thun, Jatauli and many other strongholds
 23 navambar, 1722 ke din thun or jatoli ke patan ke pashchaat aupchaarik rup se badan singh ne swayan ko jaipur darbar kaa nishthavan samant bana liya tha
 In return, Sawai Jaisingh conferred the title of 'brajraj' on Badan Singh

 Highlighting the social utility of Thakur Badan Singh and Maharaja Suraj Mal
 Natwar Singh writes - deeg ke mehalon main chatushkon banaate hue bich main 475-350 feet kaa ek bagichaa he
 There are fountains in it
 purv va pashchim main vishaal jalashay he tathaa uttar kii or nand bhawan he, pashchim main mukhya imaarat gopal bhawan he, jo sabhi mehalon main sarvaadhik vishaal he
 It is three storeyed and has a large assembly hall in between
 gopal bhawan se thodi dur do choti imaaraten hai jo sawan-bhadon bhawan ke naam se jaani jaati hai
 The quadrangle has two palaces facing south and north; To the west is the Suraj Bhawan made of marble of Makrana and to the east is the Kishan Bhawan made of brown sandstone
 in donon mehalon ke bich is majboot imaarat kii chat par ek tank he jo in sabhi mehalon va bagichon main jal pravaah karti he
 According to Brockmann, this tank is unmatched in India in providing the necessary strength to the huge capacity of the store
 gopal bhawan kaa nirmaan 1780 main kiya gaya tha
 Gopal Sagar's amazing view can be seen from this building adorned with beautiful gardens
 bhawan ke donon ore do choti imaaraten hai jinhen 'sawan bhawan' or 'bhadon bhawan' ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 Marble Suraj Bhawan is located in the south direction
 yah ek hawaadaar mahal he, jisaki alankrita deevaaren va farsh man moh lete hai
 The entire building is made of marble except for the pillar of Braramde to its west and some balcony to the north
 kuch stambh va chajje balua pathar ke bane hai
 The lime has been hardened to bring uniformity
 suraj bhawan ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki iske nirmaan main taj mahal kii nakal kii gai he
 Looking at Suraj Bhavan, it is clear that this is a completely original and unmatched construction of Hindu architecture
 nukile kinare vaale maharaab, vakr, pattiyon vaale alankrita stambh aadi sabhi hindu roopak is bhawan main maujuud hai, jo ki udaipur or amer ke mehalon se samya rakhte hai
 In many rooms, there are lotus inverted Hindu metaphors in the roofs
 tharton ke anusaar deeg ke mahal main dakshin verandey ke kuch chajje, pashchim ke kuch stambh, uttar disha ke verandey kaa farsh, in sabhi main rupavaas pargane main sthit baansi paharpur kaa pathar istemaal kiya gaya he, jo style kii romaniyata or shilp kii purnataa kii drushti se itane shreshth hai ki unase batch kar keval agra kaa tajmahal he
 While the entire building is of marble
 yahan tak ki chat kii pattiyaan bhi sangemarmar kii hai
 The reason for this is that the building started in Surajmal's time and after his death it was completed in Jawahar Singh's time
 tatkaaleen raajnneetik uthal-puthal ke us daur main sambhawatah jawahar singh ke samay nirmaankalaa par utana dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 There is Kishan Bhavan along with Suraj Bhavan
 iske saamne uttari disha main nand bhawan he
 This building has a great condition like the assembly building
 jo saat bhaagon vaale maharaabadar stambhon kii panktiyon se ghira he
 Marble windows are made on both its ends
 madhyasth stambhon par aadhaarit maharaaben ytaakar rup main niojit kii gai hai
 Marble with red stone has also been used in the building

 By the time of Akbar in the Mughal period, the Bengal style roof had become part of the Rajput style
 babar dwaara bharat main prachlit kii gayi bhawan, udyaan va fawwaron kii irani-chaar-baag paddati kii vyavastha ne hindu riyasaton ke bhawanon ko ek nayaa rup pradaan kiya
 In the medieval period, there were two trends parallel to Hindu architecture
 ek parampara ke arntagat purnataya pracheen paramparaon ke anusaar nirmaan hote the
 On the other hand, the mixed style was also adopted
 yadhyapi victoria yug main vaastukala kaa vikaas hua, parantu madhya kaal ke taj mahal, humayun kaa makbara, bijapur kii gol gumbad, deeg ke jal mahal or bharatpur ke durg kaa koi sani nahin he
 The rulers of Bharatpur were not only skilled rulers, but were good art-lovers and art patrons
 unke samay main hue nirmaan vaastukala ke adbhut namoonay hai
 Badan Singh had a good knowledge of aesthetic art, architecture and architecture
 deeg ke bhawanon evam udyanon ke vinyas se yah spasht ho jaataa he
 He built beautiful buildings in the fort of Deeg, which is known as Purana Mahal
 18 veen sadi main jabaki mogul style yaa mishrit style main kaam hua, tab hindu style kaa sthaan banaaye rakhane kaa sarthak prayaas badan singh evam surajmal ne kiya
 The position of Mughal rulers was not good at that time
 mogul sultanate baari uthal puthal kaa shikaar tha
 Artisans were leaving work from the Mughal courts
 un dinon thakur badan singh kumher kii gadhi main rahete the
 While staying there, he founded the first Jat capital 'deeg' in 1725
 uske baad 1733 main bharatpur rajdhani kii sthapana surajmal ne kii
 As the political and economic situation of Bharatpur state strengthened, so did the development of architecture in Bharatpur region
 kumher kii gadhi, deeg ke jal mahal phir bharatpur durg kaa nirmaan usee vikaas ke sopan hai
 Maharaja Badan Singh prepared the plan for the buildings of Deeg and Maharaja Suraj Mal gave that plan a realization
 yahi yojanayen maharaja badansingh ke soundarya bodh kii parichaayak hai
 Maharaja Suraj Mal's interest in the field of art was in the construction of palaces and temples
 yadhyapi unke shashan kaal main sabhi jat kilon kii marammat evam punarniman kaa kaary jari rahaa, parantu swayan unka yogadan vishesh rup se bharatpur or deeg ke aadhuniktam mehalon ke nirmaan main rahaa
 In Deeg, aside from the palaces built during his father's time, which are known as old palaces, Surajmal constructed modern palaces with beautiful reservoirs and fountains, which are still magnificent and spectacular
 kavi somnath ne 'sujan vilaas' or akhairam ne 'singhaasana battisi' main deeg ke in sundar mehalon, vatika, jalashay, aadi kaa shreshth evam sundar varnan kiya he
 The construction of beautiful buildings and strong fortification was possible only through orderly and efficient planning
 yah nirmaan kaary maharaja badan singh evam surajmal ko kushal vaastushilpi hi nahin, apitu kushal vyavasthaapak, prarupakaar evam, kalamrmajna kaa pramaan detaa he
 Maharaja Suraj Mal spent a lot of money in the construction of these palaces
 kaha jaataa he ki lakhanu ke nawab gajiuddin jo maharaja surajmal ke mitra the, jab 1759 main deeg aaye to unhone bhi upharswarup bhawanon ke nirmaan ke liye dhan diya tha
 On seeing these buildings, one gets to know about the skill and beauty of the workers and artisans of that time
 saath hi yah bhi sanket milaataa he kii unhen protsaahan miltaa tha, uchit paarishramik bhi miltaa tha
 The artisans coming out of the Mughal courts were given work by Maharaja Suraj Mal
 is yojana ko karyanvit karte samay nirmaan mantri jeevanram vanchaari the
 The buildings of Deeg are large Mughal-style square gardens with palaces, with a series of fountains run by artificial water system
 mukhya dwaar singh-pole uttar disha main uttar kii or munh kiye hue hai, jisamen nand bhawanon tak fawwaron kii shrinkhlaayein hai, jo verman main bhumigat hai
 In the middle of the square gardens is a very beautiful group of fountains in 60 feet width with an octahedral shape
 is bindu ko sabhi bhawanon se fawwaron kii panktiyaan jodatii hai
 2 on the first floor of a building built in the middle of Suraj Bhawan and Kishan Bhawan
 6 lakh litre kshamta kaa ek hauj bana hua he, jo pani kii kritrim vyavastha kaa strot he
 In this, the peacocks are made by baking the clay drains
 jin par chooney kii parat chadhi hui he
 At that time, this tank was filled with the help of two pairs of oxen in about 8 days
 hauj main moriyon kii yojana is prakaar he ki sabhi fawwaare mehalon va udyanon main rang -birangi chata bikherte hai
 Both fountains of the same color and different colors run in a row at a time
 jab ye fawwaare chal kar band hote hai to uske baad udyaan ke bich jade pathar rangon se is tarah sarobar dikhte hai jaise logon ne toliyaan banaakar holi kheli ho
 This entire arrangement of fountains is technically unique
 bhawan ke pratham tal par bana apaar kshamta kaa hauj jo 225 varshon se aaj bhi apni kshamta ke anuroop kaary kar rahaa he
 These fountains not only condition the buildings but also provide artificial rain
 in fawwaron kii visheshta vidhi, rup-rang ke alaava ek dhara tathaa sahastra dhara ke rup main dekhne yogya he
 In many buildings, a meaningful attempt has been made to give them the appearance of a waterfall
 fawwaare va udyaan kritrim varsha evam rang-birange rup se mogul kaal main nirmit srinagar ke nishat baag va shalimaar baag kii vyavastha se ek kadam aage hai
 The construction of these fountains and gardens is based on the iranian-char-bagh method
 barahdari main fawwaron kii vyavastha ucch takanic kaa bemisaal prayog he
 It has a secret system of water flow
 barahdari kii duusari chat kaa bich kaa hissaa khokhla he, jisamen lohe ke gole hai
 The water access system is based on the capillary method
 jab fawwaare chalate hai to pani is hisse main pahunch kar golon ko aapas main takaraata he jo badal garajane kaa abhas detaa he
 This construction gives evidence of being a good art lover to the then ruler
 therton kaa mat he - It is clear from the observation of entire buildings that this palace complex is in fact the center of unique Indian architecture in North India
 takanic, praaroop vyavastha evam style in sabhi aadhaaron par yah shreshth bhawan he
 The only palace of Hindu style in the whole of North India is the Jal Mahal of Deeg
 in bhawanon main kaam laai gai takanic aaj bhi aadhuniktam bani hui he
 The drainage system of palaces, whether roof or floor floor, is a proof of efficient engineering
 aadhunik visheshgyon kaa mat he ki in bhawanon main neenv bharne main tajmahal vidhi kaa anusaran kiya gaya gaya he
 Presumably, buildings have been constructed on them by making square wells under them
 govardhan dren se gopal bhawan main pani aata he tathaa jab gopal sagar puraa bhar jaataa he to atirikt jal sifan vidhi se swatah hi dren ke jariye sawan mandap va nand bhawan ke kareeb se hota hua rup sagar main chalaa jaataa he
 Seeing the Suraj Bhavan as written above, it is clear that it is a completely original and unmatched construction of Hindu architecture
 nukile kinare vaale maharaab, vakr, pattiyon vaale alankrita stambh aadi sabhi hindu roopak is bhawan main maujuud hai, jo ki udaipur or amer ke mehalon se samya rakhte hai
 In many rooms, there are lotus inverted Hindu metaphors in the roofs
 belboote tajmahal va laal kile agra ke kile ke sangemarmar ke nirmaan se samya rakhte hai to iskaa kaaran yah he ki karigar mogul darbar kaa kaam chhod kar aaye the yah unki kala kaa pradarshan he na ki nakal karne kaa

" or ye lay hi manushya kii sabhi gatividhiyon kaa aadhaar hai
 It is indispensable in humans, this indispensability is associated with the discovery and use of golden proportions by children, old people and uncultured and educated
 " Le Corbusier had said: "chairs are architectural, sofé bourgeoisie
 " Le Corbusier began experimenting with furniture design in 1928 when he invited architect Charlotte Perrians to his studio
 unke bhai piyare jaannare ne bhi kai rachanaaon main yogadan diya
 Prior to Perian, Le Corbusier used furniture made in his projects, such as the small furniture manufactured by Thone
 yah company unki rachanaaon kaa 1930 ke dashak main nirmaan karti thi
 In 1928, Le Corbusier and Periane began to implement the instructions in Le Corbusier's 1925 book "la Decorreti dojoordhui"
 is pustak main teen prakaar ke furniture varnit te - "prakaar-zaruri", "prakaar-furniture" or "maanviya-ang"
 He defined human-body objects as "our hands and feet and used for human activities
" prakaar-zaruri, prakaar-kaary, atah prakaar-vastu or prakaar-furniture
 The human-body object is an obedient servant

 There are definitely artifacts, tools, beautiful tools
 or bhalee bhanti chune, sahi anupaat main bane, raste main atkav na banane vaale or chupchaap kaam karne vaale ye upkaran lambey chalenge"
 The first results of this collaboration were three chrome-plated ducted steel chairs designed for two of his projects - Maison La Roche in Paris and a Pavilion for the Barber and Henry Church
 lee corbuziye ke 1929 selon datomne, "ghar ke liye upkaran" pariyojna ke liye is furniture ko or vistrut kiya gaya
 In 1964, it was in the life of Le Corbusier that Milan's Kasina Espa acquired the global rights to manufacture all his furniture creations
 aaj ke din kai pratiyaan maujuud hai, lekin casini hi ekmaatr utpaadak he jise "fondation lee corbuziye" dwaara adhikaar praapt hai
 Le Corbusier joined the extreme-rightists of French politics in the 1930s
 unhone jorge veloi or huebert lagardel ke saath sahyog kiya or kuch samay ke liye sindiclist patrika prelud ke sampadak bhi rahe
 In 1934 he gave a speech on architecture in Rome, for which he was called by Benito Mussolini
 naagarik yojana main unhone vichi shashan se jagah maangi or unhen nagarwaad par adhyayan karne vaali ek samiti main sthaan diya gaya
 He made plans for the reconstruction of Algiers, in which he opposed the difference in living conditions of Europeans and Africans, and described that "'civilized' people here live in burrows like mice, and that" goth "people enjoy solitude
 Live from " yah yojana or anya shaharon kii punarrachana kii yojanaayen nazarandaz kii gayi
 After this defeat, Le Corbusier often stayed away from politics

 Technical historian and architect Louis Mumford says in the city of tomorrow, nav nagarwaad andolan ke sadsy james howard kunstlar, ne lee corboojier kii nagar aayojan yojana ko vinaashkari va vyayshil bataaya he: Le Corbusier was the leading architect of early high modernity, whose 1925 plan was Voisin to destroy the entire Marai district of Paris on the right bank, creating similar skyscrapers between the wide streets
 yah paris kii kismat thi ki jab bhi agle chalis saal main ve is yojana ko le ke gaye, nagar adhikari unpar hanse hi - or lee corbuziye swa-prachaari to the hi
 But unfortunately, the Plan Voisin Plan was implemented by two US planners after World War II, and this led to the infamous Chicago Green Residential Project in Chicago, and similar twenties and antiquities

 His most effective adversary has been Jane Jacobs, who has strongly criticized Le Corbusier's civic creation theories in the death or birth of great intellectual cities
 lee corbuziye nagar niyojan main bahut adhik prabhavi the or "congress international darkitekchar modarn" ke sansthaapak sadsy the
 Le Corbusier was one of the first to understand the possibility of change in human settlements due to automobiles
 bhavishya ke nagar ko lee corbuziye ne bade apartment imaarat, jo ki park jaisi chiz se ghira hoga or pilotiyon par tikaa hoga, aisa sochaa
 Le Corbusier's principles were adopted by the makers of public housing in Western Europe and the United States

 Le Corbusier was heavily influenced by problems encountered in industrial cities in the early century
 unka sochna tha ki audyogic grih takneekon se bheed, gandagi or aniatikta failati he
 He was a leading advocate of modernism to create a better home in society and to create a better society

 Le Corbusier also gave rhythm to the idea that a place is a group of destinations in which humans move almost continuously
 atah ve automobile ko ek vaahak ke taur par jaays tehra paae or shahari sthano main frive ko mahatv de paae
 His philosophy was found to be useful to the interests of urban developers in the post-world War II era of the United States, as it allowed them to destroy traditional urban spaces and provide high-density commercial and residential urban areas with high density of architecture and intellectuals
 Succeeded in advocating for support

 This movement had no place in the planning of Le Corbusier to link the urban villages isolated from the lower middle class and the working class to other areas, that is, the suburban and rural areas to the urban commercial centers
 aisa isliye tha kyonki niyojan ke anusaar sadaken kamgir va nimna madhyam vargeey virgon ke rihayishi ilaakon ke upar se, neeche se yaa bagal se nikalati thim
 Such projects and areas had no road exit and no access to roads, as people in the Cumbini Green Home Project were cut off from opportunities to get jobs and provide service because it all took Corbuzie Were limited to traffic end-points

 After a long time, suburban centers found that a shortage of workers was a major problem, so they began to run city-to-city bus services so that all those working people could reach the suburbs without earning so much that people would get into cars
