 So he immediately served Shivji in two plates and called Shiva

 Ayurveda is one of the oldest medical systems in the world
 yah vigyaan, kala or darshan kaa mishran he
 The name 'ayurveda' means 'knowledge of life' and that is the essence of Ayurveda in a nutshell
 "ayurveda " shabd do shabdon se milakar bana he - "aayush" or "veda"
 , Ahit Age, Happiness Age, and Grief Age - they should be described as Ayurveda
 ) Ayurveda is Indian medicine
 ayurvigyaan, vigyaan kii vah shakha he jiskaa sambandh maanav sharir ko nirog rakhane, rog ho jane par rog se mukt karne athwa uskaa shaman karne tathaa aayu badhaane se he
 Ayurveda is the literature existing in the world, after which we can analyze our own lifestyle
 is shaastra ke aadi acharya ashvinikumar maane jate hai jinhone daksh prajapati ke dhad main bakre kaa sir joda tha
 Indra acquired this knowledge from Ashwini Kumar
 indra ne dhanvantari ko sikhaaya
 King of Kashi, Divodas is said to be the incarnation of Dhanvantari
 unase jaakar sushrut ne ayurveda padhaa
 Atri and Bharadwaj are also considered to be the promoters of this scripture
 apurveda ke acharya ye hai— ashvinikumar, dhanvantari, divodas, nakul, sahadev, arki, chyavan, janak, budh, jawal, jajali, pel, karath, agastya, atri tathaa unke chah shishy, sushrut or charak
 Brahma divided Ayurveda into eight parts and named each part 'tantra'
 ye aath bhaag nimnlikhit hai : Under this Ashtanga Ayurveda, there are also the elements of the body, physiology, armaments, pharmaceuticals and matter properties, medical elements and science
 iske atirikt usamen sadrush chikitsa, virdohi chikitsa or jalchikitsa aadi aajkal ke abhinav chikitsa pranaaliyon ke vidhaan bhi paye jate hai 
 According to archaeologists, the ancient book of the world is Rigveda
 vibhinn vidwaanon ne iskaa rachana kaal isa ke 3,000 se 50,000 varsh purv tak kaa mana he
 Even in this Samhita, the principles of the great importance of Ayurveda are disseminated here
 charak, sushrut, kaashyap aadi maanya granth ayurveda ko atharvaveda kaa upved maanate hai
 This proves the antiquity of Ayurveda
 atah ham kah sakate hai ki ayurveda kii rachanakaal isa purv 3,000 se 50,000 varsh pehle yani sristi kii utpatti ke aas-paas yaa saath kaa hi he
 In the context of historical knowledge of Ayurveda, the first mention of knowledge, according to Charaka, is the mention of Agnivesh - with the descent of Ayurveda in the death of the dead
 sarvapratham brahma se prajapati ne, prajapati se ashvini kumaron ne, unase indra ne or indra se bharadwaj ne ayurveda kaa adhyayan kiya
 The tenure of Chyavan Rishi has also been considered a contemporary of Ashwini Kumars
 ayurveda ke vikaas main rishi chyavan kaa atimahatvapurn yogadan he
 Then Bharadwaj got a long happy and healthy life under the influence of Ayurveda and propagated it among other sages
 tadnantar punarvasu aatreya ne agnivesh, bhel, jatu, parashar, harit or ksharpani naamak chah shishyon ko ayurveda kaa upadesh diya
 The most intelligent of these six disciples, Agnivesh first created a Samhita - the Agnivesh Tantra which was later re-invented by Charaka and named it Charaksamhita, which is the foundation pillar of Ayurveda
 sushrut ke anusaar kashiraj divodas ke rup main avatarit bhagwaan dhanvantari ke paas anya maharshiryon ke saath sushrut jab ayurveda kaa adhyayan karne hetu gayi or unase aavedan kiya
 At that time, Lord Dhanvantari preached to them that Brahma himself first published the Upveda Ayurveda of Atharvaveda in a thousand chapters - Shata Sahasra Shlokas before the creation of the universe and then divided it into eight organs by considering the human being as short-sighted
 is prakaar dhanvantari ne bhi ayurveda kaa prakaashan brahmadev dwaara hi pratipaadit kiya hua mana he
 Lord Dhanvantari again said that Daksha Prajapati from Brahma, Ashvinikumar Dwya from him and Indra studied Ayurveda from him
 ayurveda ke itihaas ko mukhyatya teen bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he - The time of the Code was in the 5th century BC
 It is believed to be from the 6th century
 yah kaal ayurveda kii moulik rachanaaon kaa yug tha
 At this time, Acharyo, on the strength of his talent and experience, practiced his erudite texts about different organs
 ayurveda ke trimuni - charak, sushrut or vagbhat, ke udai kaa kaal bhi samhitakaal hi he
 The amazing success in the field of karyotherapy through Charaka Samhita Granth is a major feature of this period
 iskaa samay 7veen shatee se lekar 15veen shatee tak mana gaya he tathaa yah kaal aalochanaon evam tikaakaron ke liye janaa jaataa he
 In this period, commentators on the compositions of the Samhidakala formulated mature and healthy interpretations
 is samay ke acharya dalhan kii sushrut samhita tikaa ayurveda jagat main ati mahatvapurn maani jaati he
 The research text 'rasaratnasamuchaya' is also a composition of this period, which has been written by Acharya Vagbhat based on Charaka and Sushruta Samhita and the composition of many rasastriyas
 is kaal kaa samay 14veen shatee se lekar aadhunik kaal tak mana jaataa he
 This period has been the period of writings of texts on specific subjects
 madhavnidan, jverdarpan aadi granth bhi isi kaal main likhe gayi
 Special attention was also paid to various forms of medicine in this period, which is relevant even in the present day
 is kaal main ayurveda kaa vistaar evam prayog bahut bade paimaane par ho rahaa he
 It is clear that the antiquity of Ayurveda has been proved since the Vedas
 aadhunik chikitsapaddati main saamaajik chikitsa paddati ko ek nai vichaardhara mana jaataa he, parantu yah koi nai vichaardhaara nahin apitu yah uski punrariti maatr he, jiskaa ullekh 2500 varshon se bhi pehle ayurveda main kiya gaya he
 The aim of Ayurveda is to protect the health of healthy animals and protect the patient from disease
 
 Ayurveda has two objectives: iske liye apane sharir or prakruti ke anukool desh, kaal aadi kaa vichaar karnaa niyamit aahaar-vihaar, cheshtaa, vyaayaam, shouch, snaan, shayan, jaagran aadi grihasth jivan ke liye upyogi shastrokt dincharya, ratricharya evam ritucharya kaa paalan karnaa, sankatmay kaaryon se bachanaa, prayek kaary vivekpurvak karnaa, man or indriya ko niyantrit rakhana, desh, kaal aadi paristhitiyon ke anusaar apane apane sharir aadi kii shakti or ashakti kaa vichaar kar koi kaary karnaa, mel, mutr aadi ke upasthit vegon ko na rokna, irshyaa, dwesh, lobh, ahankaar aadi se bachanaa, samay-samay par sharir main sanchit dosha ko nikaalane ke liye vaman, virechan aadi ke prayogon se sharir kii shuddhi karnaa, sadachaar kaa paalan karnaa or dooshit vaayu, jal, desh or kaal ke prabhaav se utpann mahamariyon main vijna chikitsakon ke upadeshon kaa samuchit rup se paalan karnaa, svachh or vishodhit jal, vaayu, aahaar aadi kaa seven karnaa or dusron ko bhi iske liye prerit karnaa, ye swasthyaraksha ke saadhan hai
 For each disease ye teenon ayurveda ke 'triskandh' kehalaati hai
 It is detailed in Ayurveda texts
 yahan keval sankshipt parichay maatr diya jayega
 But before that, a brief introduction of each ingredient is necessary, because without the knowledge of the components it will not be possible to know the disorders that occur in them
 ayurveda kaa arth pracheen aacharyon kii vyakhya or isamen aae hue 'aayu' or 'veda' in do shabdon ke arthon ke anusaar bahut vyapak he
 The Acharyas of Ayurveda have called the 'combination of body, sense, mind and soul' as age
 arthath jab tak in chaaron sampatti yaa vipatti ke anusaar aayu ke anek bhed hote hai, kintu sankshep main prabhaavbhed se ise chaar prakaar kaa mana gaya he : Sukhayu: a person rich in knowledge, science, force, strength, wealth, wealth, fame, family, etc
, being devoid of any kind of physical or mental development, is called "sukhayu"
 dukhaayu : iske vipareet samast sadhano se yukt hote hue bhi, shareerik yaa maansik rog se peedit athwa nirog hote hue bhi saadhanheen yaa swasthya or saadhan donon se hin vyakti ko "du:khaayu' kehete hai
 Hitayu: a person who possesses qualities like prudence, virtue, gentleness, generosity, truth, non-violence, peace, benevolence, etc
, while being full of health and resources or lacking in them, and continues in the welfare of society and the people
 He is called Hitayu
 ahitayu : iske vipareet jo vyakti avivek, duraachaar, krurta, swaarth, dambh, atyaachaar aadi durgunon se yukt or samaaj tathaa lok ke liye abhishaap hote hai unhen ahitayu kehete hai
 Thus, there are four distinctions of interest, harm, happiness and grief
 isi prakaar kalpramaan ke anusaar bhi dderghaayu, madhyaayu or alpaayu, sankshep main ye teen bhed hote hai
 By the way, many distinctions can also be imagined in these three
 'veda' shabd ke bhi satta, laabh, gati, vichaar, prapti or gyaan ke saadhan, ye arth hote hai or aayu ke veda ko ayurveda kehete hai
 That is, the scripture in which the nature of age, the various distinctions of age, beneficial and disrespectful to age and the means of their knowledge and the corporeal body of age, sense, mind and soul, with the development of all or any of these interests, pleasures and Ayurveda is considered to be a means of achieving the means of achieving longevity and measures to solve their obstructive issues
 kintu aajkal ayurveda "pracheen bhartiya chikitsapaddati' is sankuchit arth main prayukt hota he
 The basic five physical bodies of all efforts, senses, mind and soul are called 'bodies'
 maanav sharir ke sthool rup main chah ang hai; do haath, do pair, shir or greeva ek tathaa antradhi ek
 The components of these organs are called suffixes- ayurveda ke anusaar saare sharir main 300 asthiyaan hai, jinhen aajkal keval gananaa-kram-bhed ke kaaran do sau chah maanate hai tathaa sandhiyaan 200, snaayu 900, shirayein 700, dhamniyaan 24 or unki shakhaaen 200, peshiyaan 500 tathaa sookshm strot 30,956 hai
 According to Ayurveda, the seven metals are juice, blood, meat, fattening, bone, marrow and Venus
 nityprati swaabhaavat: vividh kaaryon main upyog hone se inkaa kshay bhi hota rahata he, kintu bhojan or paan ke rup main ham jo vividh padaarth lete rahete hai unase na keval is kshati kii purti hoti he, varan dhaatuon kii pushti bhi hoti rahati he
 The food taken in the form of food matures by pachcagni, geotropic and various metals and after many changes, it turns into the aforesaid metals and nourishes these metals
 is pachankriya main aahaar kaa jo saar bhaag hota he usase ras dhaatu kaa poshan hota he or jo kitt bhaag bachataa he usase mel or mutr banataa he
 This juice reaches the whole body through the veins through the heart and provides nutrition to every metal and organ
 dhaatvagniyon se pachan hone par ras aadi dhaatu ke saar bhaag se rakt aadi dhaatuon evam sharir kaa bhi poshan hota he tathaa kitt bhaag se malon kii utpatti hoti he, jaise ras se kaph; rakt pitt; maance se naak, kaan or netra aadi ke dwaara baahar aanevaale mel; med se swead ; asthi se kesh tathaa lom or majja se aankh kaa keechad malaroop main banate hai
 Venus has no stool, oozes are produced from all its parts
 inhen rasadi dhaatuon se anek upadhaatuon kii bhi utpatti hoti he, yatha ras se doodh, rakt se conderaayein or shirayen, maance se vasa, twachaa or uske chah yaa saat str, med se snaayu, asthi se daant, majja se kesh or shukr se oj naamak upadhaatuon kii utpatti hoti he
 These metals and substrates are useful in different body functions by being located in different forms in different components
 jab tak ye uchit pariman or swaroop main rahati hai or inaki kriya swaabhaavik rahati he tab tak sharir swasth rahata he or jab ye nune yaa adhik maatra main tathaa vikrut swaroop main hoti hai to sharir main rog kii utpatti hoti he
 According to the ancient philosophical theory, all the gross matter of the world, earth, water, light, air and sky are formed by the combination of these five elements
 inke anupaat main bhed hone se hi unke bhinn-bhinn rup hote hai
 Similarly, all the metals, substrates and feces of the body are five physical
 parinamat: sharir ke samast avyav or atat: sara sharir paanchabhautik he
 These are all unconscious
 jab inamen aatma kaa sanyog hota he tab uski chetanta main inamen bhi chetana aati he
 The body starts in the mother's uterus due to the combination of pure raja and pure semen under proper conditions and the infusion of the soul in it
 ise hi garbh kehete hai
 The fetus receives nutrition from the dietary blood of the mother through the placenta and the womb, which is attached to the navel
 yah garbhodak main nimagn rahakar upasnehan dwaara bhi poshan praapt karata he tathaa pratham maas main kalal or dwitiya main ghan hota he? tisare maas main ang pratyang kaa vikaas aarambh hota he
 In the fourth month, it becomes more stable and the signs of pregnancy start to appear clearly in the mother
 is prakaar yah mata kii kukshi main uttarottar viksit hota hua jab sampurna ang, pratyang or avyavon se yukt ho jaataa he, tab praaia: nawein maas main kukshi se baahar aakar naveen praani ke rup main janm grahan karata he
 Each organ or any component in the body is formed with the purpose, that is, the accomplishment of specific functions by each component, such as holding with hands, walking with feet, eating with mouth, chewing with teeth etc
 kuch avyav aise bhi hai jinase kai kaary hote hai or kuch aise hai jinase ek vishesh kaary hi hota he
 Among those who have a particular work, there is a specific subtle structure that is empowered for that work
 isi ko indriya kehete hai
 In order to gain knowledge of these external subjects, words, touch, form, juice and smell, these components are called sensory organs, respectively, ear, skin, eye, tongue and nasal and the specific powerful subtle object in them is called sense
 ye kramash: paanch hai- Among these subtle elements, among the panchamabhutas is the characteristic of the mahabhut whose words etc
 have special properties; Such as the sky in the srotra sense for the word, the air in the sensory sense for touch, the sharp in the sensory sense for the form, the earth in the sun for the juice and the earth element in the olfactory for smell
 in paanchon indriyon ko gyanendriya kehete hai
 In addition to these, there are five concentrates for specific performance, such as legs for movement, hands for eclipse, lingua for speaking, anus and urethra for excretion and penis for childbirth
 ayurveda darshanikon kii bhanti indriyon ko aahankaarik nahin, apitu bhautik maanata he
 These senses have a tendency to be inspired by their actions
 man se sampark na hone par ye niskriy rahati he
 Every creature has a very subtle body and only one mind
 yah atyant drutagati vaala or prayek indriya kaa niyantrak hota he
 But it itself remains inactive by being unconscious without contact with the soul
 prayek vyakti ke man main satv, raj or tam, ye teenon prakritik gun hote hue bhi inamen se kisi ek kii saamanyat: prabalata rahati he or usee ke anusaar vyakti satvik, rajas yaa taamas hota he, kintu samay-samay par aahaar, aachaar evam paristhitiyon ke prabhaav se dasre gunon kaa bhi prabalya ho jaataa he
 Its knowledge is through the signs of instincts, such as raga-malice - zero realist mind is satvic, ragya, conscious and playful mind is Rajas and the mind is tamas with laziness, longevity and inactivity
 isiilie satvik man ko shuddh, satv yaa prakritik mana jaataa he or raj tathaa tam uske dosha kahe gaye hai
 By attaining consciousness from the soul, the natural or sad mind induces the senses in their respective subjects according to their qualities and according to that the bodily functions are done accordingly
 aatma man ke dwaara hi indriyon or shariravayavon ko pravrutt karata he, kyonki man hi uskaa karan he
 That is why knowledge comes from the senses with which the mind interacts, not through another
 kyonki man ek ore sookshm hota he, at: ek saath uskaa anek indriyon ke saath sampark sabhav nahin he
 Yet his pace is so rapid that he quickly changes in contact with the other senses, so that we know that he is in contact with everyone and all things are happening simultaneously, but not really Happen
 aatma panchmahabhoot or man se bhinn, chetanavan, nirvikaar or nity he tathaa sakshi swaroop he, kyonki swayan nirvikaar tathaa niskriy he
 It interacts with the active but unconscious mind, senses and body, and they are conscious
 aatma main rup, rang, akruti aadi koi chihn nahin he, kintu uske bina sharir achetan hone ke kaaran nishcesht padaa rahata he or mrit kahalata he tathaa uske sampark se hi usamen chetana aati he tab use jivit kaha jaataa he or usamen anek swaabhaavik kriyaayein hone lagati hai; jaise shwasochvas, chote se bada hona or kate hue ghaav bharna aadi, palkon kaa khulanaa or band hona, jivan ke lakshan, man kii gati, ek indriya se hue gyaan kaa duusari indriya par prabhaav hona, vibhinn indriyon or avyavon ko vibhann kaaryon main pravrutt karnaa, vishyon kaa grahan or dhaaran karnaa, swapn main ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak pahunchnaa, ek aankh se dekhi vastu kaa duusari aankh se bhi anubhav karnaa
 Desire, malice, happiness, sorrow, effort, patience, intelligence, memory, ego, etc
 are only when the soul is in the body; Selfless people are not in dead bodies
 at: ye aatma ke lakshan kahe jate hai, arthath aatma kaa purvokt lakshanon se anumaan maatr kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not possible to direct it from any other senses other than mental imagination
 yah aatma nity, nirvikaar or vyapak hote hue bhi purvakrit shubh yaa ashubh karm ke parinamswaroop jaisi yoni main yaa sharir main, jis prakaar ke man or indriyon tathaa vishyon ke sampark main aati he vaise hi kaary hote hai
 Progressively inauspicious actions leads to downward progress and progress is progressively by auspicious deeds, salvation is attained when the mind is raga-malice-inferior
 is vivaran se spasht ho jaataa he ki aatma to nirvikaar he, kintu man, indriya or sharir main vikruti ho sakati he or in teenon ke paraspar saapekshya hone ke kaaran ek kaa vikaar duusare ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to keep them in a state of nature or deformed or brought into nature
 isse deergh sukh or hitayu kii prapti hoti he, jisase kramash: aatma ko bhi uske ekmaatr, kintu bheeshan, janm mrityu or bhavabandhanrup rog se mukti paane main sahaayta milti he, jo ayurveda main naitishthaki chikitsa kahi gai he
 Charaka has briefly written the symptoms of disease and healing- sushrut ne swasth vyakti kaa lakshan vistaar se diya he- If the symptoms are contrary, it should be considered unhealthy
 rog ko vikruti yaa vikaar bhi kehete hai
 Therefore, malformations in the natural form or action of body, senses and mind are diseases
 rog ke kaaran ko 'nidaan' yah paryaayi shabd aayaa he
 When a diet or vihara shows the disease on the body, then it is called diagnosis
 sansar kii sabhi vastuen saakshaat yaa parampara se sharir, indriyon or man par kisi na kisi prakaar kaa nishchit prabhaav daalati hai or anuchit yaa pratikul prabhaav se inamen vikaar utpann kar rogon kaa kaaran hoti hai
 Detailed discussion of all these is difficult, so in a nutshell they are divided into three sections: pragyaparaadh : avivek, adheeratha tathaa purv anubhav or vaastaviktaa kii upeksha ke kaaran laabh haani kaa vichaar kiye bina hi kisi vishay kaa seven yaa jaanate hue bhi anuchit vastu kaa seven karnaa
 This is also called inferior, false and excessive yoga of karma in other and clearer terms
 asatmyendriarsanyog : chakshu aadi indriyon kaa apane-apane rup aadi vishyon ke saath asatmya sanyog indriyon, sharir or man ke vikaar kaa kaaran hota he; yatha aankh se bilkul na dekhnaa, ati tejasvi vastuon kaa dekhnaa or bahut adhik dekhnaa tathaa atisookshm, sankeern, ati dur main sthit tathaa bhayanak, bibhats, evam vikrutrup vastuon ko dekhnaa 
 They also cause disorder in the mind and body along with the eye and its innate eyes
 isi ko duusare shabdon main arth kaa duryog bhi kehete hai
 Rituals like summer, rain, cold etc
 and childhood, youth and old age also have an effect on the body, etc
, but their inferiority, falsehood and non-use effect are particularly harmful
 purvokt kaarnon ke prakarantar se anya bhed bhi hote hai; yatha In contrast, they have two other differences - sharir par in sabhi kaarnon ke teen prakaar ke prabhaav hote hai : Doshapakop - Changes in any one or many of the five elements, etc
, due to many factors, it is mandatory to change their natural proportions
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar ayurvedacharyon ne in vikaron ko vaat, pitt or kaph in virgon main vibhakt kiya he
 Panchamabhuta and Tridosha are considered separately, but in short it should be understood that all the tangible substances of the world are made up of these five elements, sky, air, light, water and earth
 ye prithvi aadi ve hi nahin he jo hamen nityprati sthool jagat main dekhne ko milte hai
 These last five are the five physics generated by the combination of the aforesaid elements
 vastuon main jin tatwon kii bahulata hoti he ve unheen naamon se varnit kii jaati hai
 In the same way, the elements of which we have a lot in our body metals or in their components are counted in the same category
 in paanchon main akaash to nirvikaar he tathaa prithvi sabase sthool or sabhi kaa aashray he
 Whatever development or change happens, it clearly has an impact on it
 shesh teen sab prakaar ke parivartan yaa vikaar utpann karne main samarth hote hai
 Therefore, depending on the abundance of the three, various metals and their constituents have been labeled Vata, Pitta and Kapha
 saamaanya rup se ye teenon dhaatuen sharir kii poshak hone ke kaaran vikrut hone par anya dhaatuon ko bhi dooshit karti hai
 Therefore, due to defects and feces, it is called mal
 rog main kisi bhi kaaran se inhen teenon kii nunata yaa adhikta hoti he, jise doshapracope kehete hai
 Metal pollution - There are some substances or causes that cause disorder in a particular metal or component
 inkaa prabhaav saare sharir par nahin hota
 These are called metal pollutants
 ubhayhetu- ve padaarth jo saare sharir main vaat aadi dosha ko kupit karte hue bhi kisi dhaatu yaa ang vishesh main hi vishesh vikaar utpann karte hai, ubhayhetu kehalaate hai
 But the changes which occur in these three, vata, pitta or kapha cause disorder in any one, two or three of these three
 at: ye hi teenon dosha pradhan sharirgat kaaran hote hai, kyonki inke swaabhaavik anupaat main parivartan hone se sharir kii dhaatuon aadi main bhi vikruti hoti he
 Due to a disorder in the composition, it is also natural to have a disorder in the action
 is aswabhaavik rachana or kriya ke parinamswaroop atisar, kaas aadi lakshan utpann hote hai or in lakshanon ke samooh ko hi rog kehete hai
 In this way, the effects of which are the deformities in vata etc
 defects and Vatadi doshas, which distort physical metals, are called both for or nidana
 antat: inke do anya mahatvapurn bhedon kaa vichaar apekshit he : The means by which disorders are identified due to the aforesaid causes are called gender
 iske chaar bhed hai : purvarup, rup, samprapti or upshay
 Poorforma - The symptoms that arise due to the small or initial deformity within the body before a disease is expressed, and the possibility of origin of a particular disease is called Puroform
 rup - jin lakshanon se rog yaa vikruti kaa spasht parichay miltaa he unhen rup kehete hai
 Procreation: For which reason, which defect is caused independently or subcutaneously, singly or secondly, in how many degrees and in how much quantity, in which metal or in which organ, what kind of disorder it causes Determination is called attainment
 chikitsa main isi kii mahatvapurn upyogita he
 In fact, it is only due to these changes that diseases arise in the form of sorghum, so they can actually be called diseases as well and the treatment done with these changes is also successful
 upshay or anupashay - jab alpata yaa sankeernata aadi ke kaaran rogon ke vaastavik kaarnon yaa swaroopon kaa nirnay karne main andeh hota he, tab us andeh ke niraakaran ke liye sambhavit dosha yaa vikaron main se kisi ek ke vikaar se upyukt aahaar-vihaar or aushadh kaa prayog karne par jisase laabh hota he use upachay ke vivechan main ayurvedacharyo ne chah prakaar se aahaar-vihaar or aushadh ke prayogon kaa sutara batalaate hue upshay ke 18 bhedon kaa varnan kiya he
 These formulas are of such importance that on the basis of each of them, a medical system has emerged; like, upshay or anupashay se bhi rog kii pahchaan main sahaayta milti he
 Therefore, they too have been counted by the elders in "linga"
 hetu or ling ke dwaara rog kaa gyaan praapt karne par hi uski uchit or safal chikitsa sambhav he
 Diseases are tested for and sex, but the patient should be tested for their proper knowledge
 rogi pariksha ke saadhan chaar hai - aptopadesh, pratyaksh, anumaan or yukti
 Qualified authorities, being endowed with austerity and knowledge, know and say the scriptures unambiguously and realistically with the raga-malice-zero intellect
 aise vidvan, anusandhanshil, anbhavi, pakshpaatahin or yatharth vaktaa mahapurushon ko aapt or unke vachanon yaa lekhon ko aptopadesh kehete hai
 After a complete examination, the people who have written the scriptures have written in relation to each of them that due to such reason, due to formulation of this defect and contamination of this metal and dependence on this organ, such a disease with such symptoms arises
 , There are so-and-so changes and there is peace in using these dietary and such-like medicines for its treatment and by treating them
 isliye pratham yogya or anbhavi gurujanon se shaastra kaa adhyayan karne par rog ke hetu, ling or aushadhgyaan main pravriti hoti he
 According to the scriptures, symptoms are tested by direct, predictable and tact
 manoyogpurvak indriyon dwaara vishyon kaa anubhav praapt karne ko pratyaksh kehete hai
 Through this, after examining the various words occurring in the suffix of the body part, the knowledge of their natural or unnatural should be done by the patient
 varna, akruti, lambaai, chaudaai aadi pramaan tathaa chaaya aadi kaa gyaan netron dwaara, gandhon kaa gyaan ghranendriya tathaa sheet, ushn, ruksh, snigdh evam naadee aadi ke spandan aadi bhaavon kaa gyaan sparshendriya dwaara praapt karnaa chahie
 Due to the inappropriate examination of the body juice of the patient with his own tongue, there is no feeling of ant in his body or the sweat, urine, blood, poo etc
, flies coming and coming, eating by crow or dog etc
 Whether or not to eat, their appearance can be estimated by looking directly
 yuktipurvak tark ke dwaara praapt gyaan anumaan he
 Subjects which cannot be obvious or even if there is doubt regarding them, should be tested by inference; For example, of firepower on the basis of digestion, physical strength on the basis of the power of exercise, the nature or distortion of the senses by accepting or not accepting their subjects and similarly interest in food, anorexia and thirst and fear, grief, anger
 One should infer various physical and mental topics through mental expressions like desire, malice
 purvokt upshayanupashay bhi anumaan kaa hi vishay he
 This means planning
 anek kaarnon ke saamudayik prabhaav se kisi vishisht kaary kii utpatti ko dekhakar, tadnukool vichaaron se jo kalpana kii jaati he use yukti kehete hai
 For example, the plant grows by the combination of field, water, tillage, seed and season
 dhuen kaa aag ke saath sadaiv sambandh rahata he, arthath jahaan dhuaan hoga vahaan aag bhi hogi
 This is also called Vyaptigyan and based on this, logic is inferred
 is prakaar nidaan, purvarup, rup, samprapti or upshay in sabhi ke saamudayik vichaar se rog kaa nirnay yuktiyukt hota he
 You can also use the scheme from the other point of view in the examination of the patient
 jaise kisi indriya main yadi koi vishay saralata se grahya na ho to anya yantradi upkarnon kii sahaayta se us vishay kaa grahan karnaa bhi yukti main hi antarbhoot he
 For the knowledge of the aforesaid sexes and for the knowledge of the feasibility or incivility with the disease, according to the objection, by the direct examinations, the characters, tone, smell, in addition to the essence, elements, condensation, proof, truth, diet, strength and age of the patient
 Rasa and touch these subjects, srotra, chakshu, olfactory, rasan and sphachendriya, sattva, bhakti, shache, piety, ethics, memory, shape, force, guilt, sleepiness, beginning, gravity, short Evidence of qualities like, coldness, warmth, softness, sclerosis etc
, properties of food, digestion and quantity, remedies, disease and its nature etc
, nuisance, shadow, reflection, dream, messengers and avenues to call the patient to see and All subjects should be examined considering the nature and pathology of the subjects like Shakun and bad omen, Graha Yoga, at the time of entering the patient's home
 visheshat: naadee, mel, mutr, jihva, shabd, sparsh, netra or akruti kii saavdhaanee se pariksha kerani chahie
 In Ayurveda, the examination of the pulse is a matter of great importance
 keval nadeepariksha se dosha evam dooshyon ke saath rogon ke swaroop aadi kaa gyaan anbhavi vaidya praapt kar letaa he
 The means by which diseases caused by diseases and physical deformities are eliminated is called medicine
 ye makhytah do prakaar kii hoti he : apdravyabhoot or dravyabhoot
 Adversity medicine is one in which no substance is used, such as fasting, resting, sleeping, waking, walking, exercising, etc
 bahya yaa abhyantar prayogon dwaara sharir main jin bahya dravyon kaa prayog hota he ve dravyabhoot aushadh hai
 These materials are briefly of three types: sharir kii bhaanti ye sabhi dravya bhi paanchabhautik hote hai, inke bhi ve hi sanghatak hote hai jo sharir ke hai
 Therefore, there is no substance in the world that cannot be used in some form or the other, in some form of some disease, especially in the form of medicine
 kintu inke prayog ke purv inke swaabhaavik gundharm, sanskaarajnya gundharm, prayogvidhi tathaa prayogmarg kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 Some of these substances mitigate defects, some contaminate and contaminate the metal and some are useful in keeping the metal stable, namely, in the five physical components of liquids for proper knowledge of their usefulness, according to sequence, gravity Knowledge of the properties, juices, vapor, semen, effects and quantity is essential
 sabhi dravya sadaiv apane prakritik roopon main sharir main upyogi nahin hote
 To make it useful for the metals of the body and suitable for verification, considering the necessity of disease and the patient; For the change in the natural appearance and properties of these liquids, the measures taken by various physical and chemical rites are called "kalpana"
 jaise-swaras, kalk yaa churna, sheet kwath, kwath, aasav tathaa arishth, tel, ghrit, avaleh aadi tathaa khanij dravyon ke shodhan, jaaran, maaran, amritikaran, satvapathan aadi
 Physicians, introductors, drugs and patients, together, whatever measures or actions are done for the purpose of equality of physical metals, are called therapies
 yah do prakaar kii hoti he : nirodhak tathaa pratishedhak ; jaise sharir ke prakrutistha dosha or dhaatuon main vaishamy na ho tathaa samya kii parampara nirantar bani rahe, is uddeshy se kii gai chikitsa nirodhak he tathaa jin kriyaaon yaa upachaaron se visham hui shareerik dhaatuon main samta utpann kii jaati he unhen pratishedhak chikitsa kehete hai
 There are three types of re-therapy: gita main spasht ullikhit he- man ev manuyana kaarann bandhamokshayoh - keval maansik hi nahin apitu anekanek shaareerik rogon kii chikitsa main bhi yadi manushya ko prerit kiya jaae to aashaatheet safalataa praapt hoti he
 In this, there are measures to prevent the mind from harmful subjects and to get relief, reassurance etc
 anekanek vyaktiyon ne apane aatmbal ke balboote par gambheer rogon ko parrast kiya he
 Therefore, a successful physician tries to develop the self-confidence of the patient
 isamen grah aadi dosha ke shamanarth tathaa purvakrit ashubh karm ke praayshchittaswarup devaraadhan, jap, havan, puja, paath, vraat, tathaa mani, mantra, yantra, ratna or aushadhi aadi kaa dhaaran, ye upaay hote hai

 The soul has already been described as formless
 uske sadhano tathaa aadhaar main vikaar hone par in sabaki sanchaalak aatma main vikaar kaa hamen abhas maatr hota he
 But as a result of premeditated inauspicious deeds, the soul should also perform satsangati, jnana, viragya, theology, fast, etc

 inhen bhi dekhen- rasvidya The Japanese language is the main language and official language of Japan
 dwitiya mahayuddh se pehle korea, formosa or sakhaleen main bhi japani boli jaati thi
 Even now the number of Japanese is known enough in Korea and Farmosa, but gradually their number is decreasing
 bhashavid ise 'ashlisht-yogtmak bhashaa' maanate hai
 The Japanese language does not belong to the chinese-tibetan language family
 bhashavid ise khud kii japani bhashaa-parivaar main rakhte hai 
 These are written in a mixture of two scripts: Kanji script and Kana script
 is bhashaa main aadar-suchak shabdon kaa ek bada tantra he or bolne main "pich-system" zaruri hota he
 Many words have been taken from Chinese language in it
 japani bhashaa kis bhashaa kul main sammilit he is sambandh main ab tak koi nishchit mat sthapit nahin ho sakaa he
 But it is clear that Japanese and Korean languages have a close relationship and many scholars today believe that the Korean language should be included in the Altaic language
 japani bhashaa main bhi uccharan or vyakaran sambandhi anek visheshtaayen he jo anya altaai bhashaaon ke samaan hai parantu ye visheshtaayen ab tak itani kaaphi nahin samajhi jaati raheen jinamein ham nishchit rup se kah saken ki japani bhashaa altike bhashaakul main i ek he
 Haiku is its major poetic genre
 japani bhashaa kab se aarambh hoti he is sambandh main pramaan na hone ke kaaran nishchit rup se kuch bataaya nahin ja saktaa
 a Chinese book written in the third century gives the names of some places and people in Japan, from which it can be inferred that the Japanese language had developed at that time
 7 veen-8veen shatabdi me japani logon ne chini bhashaa or lipi sikhi or chini bhashaa main itihaas, bhugol aadi likhe gaye
 Gradually, a solution was found to write Japanese language in Chinese script
 japan main sabase puraani kavitaaon kaa sangrah maanayoshyu isi upaay se likhaa gaya tha
 Chinese words are singular
 is kaaran uske ek-ek lipichihn se japani bhashaa kaa uccharan prakat karnaa atyant saral tha
 These types of scripts are called "manyo" scripts
 in lipiyon ke adhyayan se gyaat hua he ki us samay kii japani bhashaa main aath prakaar ke swar or shabdon main swar anurupata hoti thi
 Even now, like the words Kokoro, Atama, etc
, there are many words made from the same vowel
 china ke saath gamnaagaman band ho jane ke kaaran japan kii api samskruti kaa vikaas hua
 Vowel conformity was omitted in the language and the number of vowels was reduced to only five
 chini lipi-chihnon ko saral karke japan kii apni do prakaar kii lipiyaan "hiraagaana" or "katakana" ban gayi
 Hiragana created by simplifying the Chinese script
 aarambh main yah lipi visheshtya striyon main lokapriy hui
 The language was written only in the same script, excluding the Chinese script
 katakana chini bhashaa main likhi pustak ko japani kii bhanti padhane kii drushti se banaai gai
 Often it was constructed with a part of the Chinese script icon
 aarambh se hi yah lipi chini lipiyon ke saath milakar likhi jaati thi
 At this time, the study of Sanskrit language and script had also started in Japan through China
 nai japani lipiyon kii varnmaala sanskrit kii varnmaala ke anukaran main banaai gai
 The political center of this time was Western Japan
 purvi japan ke sainikon ke aane se bhashaa main visheshkar uccharan main parivartan aa gaya
 During this time the power of the generals increased and for some time remain the Kamakura political center near Tokyo
 is kaal main anek ladaaiyaan hone ke kaaran pracheen bhashaa kii parampara tuutane lagi or uccharan tathaa vyakaran me bada parivartan aa gaya
 The people of Europe engaged in the last part of this period and studied the Japanese language for the purpose of spreading Christianity
 unke likhe vyakaran or shabdkosh uplabdh hai
 The condition of the Japanese language of that time is well known by many books written by him
 isi samay chapai kaa vikaas hua or buddha dharm, canafucheevaad, main bhi chikitsa shaastra aadi kii pustaken chhaapi gai
 But books written in Chinese were printed more and the number of books written in Japanese was less
 is kaal tak pracheen bhashaa kaa kaal kah sakate hai; parantu is samay ke ant main bhashaa kaa rup badalakar aadhunik bhashaa kaa rup dhaaran karne laga
 In this way, the people of the Tokugawa family began to rule in place of the emperor, Tokyo became the capital and the Jagirdari system became firm
 aarambh main osaka saanskrithik centre tha parantu 18 veen shatabdi ke antim bhaag se "edo" saanskrithik centre bana
 Literature was mostly written in the dialect of Edo
 desh jaagiron main vibhajit hone ke kaaran or logon ke jaagiron ke baahar aane jane kaa avasar bahut kam hone ke kaaran is kaal main anek boliyon kaa vikaas hua
 Pronunciation became like the modern language and the rules for the conversion of verbs into grammar began to simplify
 aarambh main edo main bhinn bhinn boliyaan bolanewaale ikatthe hue the parantu dhire dhire edo nagar kii apni boli kaa vikaas hua
 It has developed further and has become a common language nowadays
 is samay pracheen japani bhashaa tathaa sahitya kaa adhyayan bahut adhik kiya jane laga
 From this time the method of writing Chinese scripts more and more in Hirakana was preferred
 is kaal main samrat swayan rajya karne lage ore tokio rajdhani bana
 The dialect of this place started to be accepted as a common language
 europe ke saath sampark sthapit hua tathaa europe ke anek shabd chini lipi main anudit hokar jansadharan main prachlit hone lage
 Due to excessive use of Chinese scripts, many words with the same pronunciation became
 europe ke sahitya ke anuwaad se bhashaa main nai shaileyon kaa vikaas hua
 Literature in the colloquial language became increasingly popular from 1887 onwards
 gyaan vigyaan kii pustaken ab tak kii lekhan style main upar se neeche kii ore likhi jane ke badale bain se dayee ore likhi jane lageen
 This trend is increasing even more and after the Second World War, the government mandates are also written from left to right
 ab patrapatrika, radio, televijan aadi sadhano se sarvasaamaanya bhashaa kaa prachaar atyant teevrgati se bad rahaa he or desh ke kone kone main tokio kii boli samajhi tathaa boli jane lagi
 In order to make the language as simple as possible by reducing the more used Chinese scripts, writing the Chinese script in short form, the use of Hirakana and Katakana uniformly, studying the Roman script etc
 Is being tried 1946 main jab japan kaa nayaa samvidhan hirkaana or chini lipiyon ko milakar likhaa gaya tha us samay se praaia: samast patrapatrikaon main bhi yahi upaay apanaaya ja rahaa he
 Katakana is used when copying the pronunciation of foreign words
 kuch log tiperiter ke liye katakana kaa prayog karte hai parantu yah ab tak lokapriy nahin ho sakaa he
 There are many dialects in Japanese language because of the characteristics of Indian society in Japanese society and the language is very old
 jin main mukhya kyushyu he
 There is a clear difference in the dialects of western Japan and eastern Japan, especially in their pronunciation
 meji kaal se shiksha ke prachaar ke kaaran har kshetra main sarvamaanya bhashaa tokio kii boli, samajhi jaati he
 Apart from the regional dialects, different dialects are spoken by distinction of profession, male and female, upper class, lower class etc
 upar ke har prakaar ke bhedon ke saath saath prayek japani ko sunaanevaale ke bade chote ke bhedon ke saath saath prayek japani ko sunanevaale ke bade chote ke bhed se teen prakaar kii style main bolnaa padataa he
 When speaking to people who are smaller or equal to you, one has to make a sentence of type Da, while speaking with some elder, desu type and while talking with great respect, one has to make a sentence of type Gojaimasu
 likhit bhashaa main bhi aru or arimasu donon sheliyaan hai
 Vowel: a e u a o vyanjan : sadaa swar ke saath hokar uccharit hone ke kaaran keval vyanjan prakat karanevaali lipi nahin he
 Following is the consonant script: k ki ku ke ko cu kyo Gee Gee Gye Gye Gye Gyeo sa shi su se so shy shyu shyo xxwrep 8 j j t chi tsu te to c chyu jyo Give it na ni nu ne no nya new nyo Hoo hoo ha ho ha hoo hoo saghosh ke liye vishesh lipi chihn nahi hai
 Aghosha script has two marks placed on it
 jab japani lipi bani, kycu kyo jaise uccharan nahin the
 These have since been adopted by the influence of the Chinese language
 isaliye ye mul lipi ke baad chote akshar lagaakar prakat kiye jate hai
 In addition to the above written pronunciation, there are two more: n ke liye When sure, like a good word, i also think that k is a quantity
 is maatra kii prakat karne ke liye chote akshar tasu likhte hai
 The Japanese words are of musical accent
 swaraghaat ke prakaar bahut kam hai
 The following are only four types of distinctions in four-volume words
 japani bhashaa main ek hi uccharan or vibhinn arthvaale anek shabd hai
 Even in accent, those words do not have the power to distinguish
 kami or kami ke uccharan, swaraghaat main koi antar nahin he
 We can know the difference between the two only by looking at their Chinese script
 parantu yah swaraghaat vaakya main shabdasmooh ko acchhee bhanti bataata he
 Niwano sakuro mo minna chite shimta vatakushi va nihongo no benkyo o shite orimasu Thus, the place of words in a sentence coincides with Hindi a lot
 parantu japani bhashaa ke sanyogatmak na hokar yogtmak hone ke kaaran kuch visheshtaayen dhyaan dene yogya hai
 Nouns do not use fractions
 vaakya main sangya kaa sambandh bataane ke liye sahaayak shabd yaa sahaayak kriyaayein lagaai jaati hai
 There is no change in "vatakushi" to reveal "I" in the above sentence
 karta kaarak ko vyakt karne ke liye sahaayak shabd "va" lagaaya he
 There is no gender discrimination in noun, but there is some distinction between conscious, unconscious things like humans, animals etc
 sangya ke rup main koi bhed nahin hota parantu baad main aanevaali kriya main, ekvachan bahuvachan ke rup main bhed aa jate hai
 The prefix "o" is applied to the noun to show respect or humility
 jaise : tegaami xxrep 8 
 patr Otegami xxrep 7 
 Your letter aadaraaspad se, barabarwale se, chote darje ke logon se athwa namrata se kehane ke liye bhinn bhinn shabd hai
 It is very difficult to use these words properly like i do
 vatakushi hri visheshkar striyaan kahati hai
 Men also use this word to show humility in front of elders
 vaatashi Vashi, Boku, Ore, atai : choti ladkiyaan The verb has metamorphosis
 ek shabd do yaa adhik matraaon kaa hota he1 a feature in the verb is words like mieru kikएeru which are used only in relation to unconscious objects
 hindi kii bhanti sangya main suru lagaakar kriyaayein banaai jaati hai jaise- Shippetsu Suru But one of the features in relation to such verbs is that when such a verb comes at the end of the sentence, sometimes the sentence is completed by putting "suru"
 jaise rokuji kisho
 Shichiji Shippetsu
 
 There are two types of negatives like kuroi, akai, such as ikrant and shijukana, genkina
 visheshnon main bhi kriya kii bhanti rupaparivartan hota he
 The manner of counting human beings, animals etc
 animals and unconscious things is different: sahaayak shabd main rup parivartan nahin hota
 Forms of words are very small, mostly one volume
 teen matraaon se adhik lambey shabd bahut kam hai
 These words serve as the inflection and adverb of the genitive and conjunctive words of Hindi
 sambandhbodhak ga o ni no de paan shabd hai : Ram c Yuki Masu
 tegmi o yomu Roku ni oriru samucchyabodhak kar, ga keredomo, shi, chaar shabd hai
 Asa wa hai shi, Yoru and Osoi shi, taihenda Have trouble swatantra shabd or paratantr shabd main vibhajit hote hai
 The term paratantra is mostly of one to four quantities but two three paratantras can also be applied simultaneously
 swatantra shabdon main chaar matraavaale adhik hai or mul bhaag chini lipi main tathaa rup parivartan karanevaale bhaag hirkaana main likhe jate hai
 Very large, large, sometimes 10-15 volumes of words can be formed by adding more Chinese scripts
 parantu teen chaar matraaon ke shabd adhik pasand kiye jane ke kaaran chini lipiyon ke kisi kisi hisse ko katkar laghu shabd bananaa pasand kiya jaataa he, jaise"nihon kyoshokuin kumhai" ke sthaan par "nikkyoso" is prakaar ke anek shabd banaae jane ke kaaran ek hi uccharan ke evam anek arth prakat karanevaale shabd bahut milte hai
 Words made in Japan have a place of utmost importance in the Japanese language by adding Chinese words or Chinese scripts
 aajkal ke samachaarpatron main prayukt shabdon main se koi 10 pratishat aise shabd hai
 a major difficulty in reading words written in Chinese scripts is that there are three different pronunciations for each script
 kaaran yah he ki china main "kaan" rajkul, "go" rajkul or "to" rajkul ke shasankalon main chini lipiyon ke uccharan bhinn the or in teenon kaalon main chini bhashaa kaa prabhaav japani bhashaa par padataa rahaa
 Thus there are three distinctions to read according to Chinese pronunciation
 iske atirikt jab ye lipiyaan japan ke apane mul shabdon ke liye prayukt kii jaati hai ye chini lipiyaan apane apane arth ke anusaar japani uccharan main padhi jaati hai
 Thus sometimes a Chinese script is read in seven eight ways
 meji kaal main jab japan main videshiyon kaa prabhaav padane laga, club, backet, blanket, romentic, tobaco jaise shabd yaa to unke uccharan ko lekar yaa unke artho ko lekar chini lipi main likhe jane lage
 But nowadays such words are mostly written in Katakana
 aadhunik japani bhashaa main kul shabdon ke paanch prati shat aise videshi shabd hai
 In these foreign words, the names of industrial-trade instruments, clothing, living-related words and sports are more
 inamen angreji or aajkal amareeki shabd sabase adhik hai
 More words have been taken from Germany in relation to medicine, philosophy, climbing of mountains, French in relation to art, Italid in relation to music
 chini bhashaa ko milakar videshi shabdon main rupaparivartan nahin hote
 When the verb is to be formed, such words are followed by the beginning, such as sine suru
 raajaaon ke maranoparant unki yaad main sthapaty kii drushti se vishisht smarak banaaye gaye, jinhen chhatariyaan tathaa deval ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Chhatris are mostly seen in the Indian state of Rajasthan
 jisamen jaipur kii gator, jodhpur kii jaswant thada ,kota kaa chhatra vilaas baag, jaisalmer kaa bada baag to is drushti se bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 Jaisalmer's yellow stone chhatris are beautiful
 chhatriyon main hindu or muslim donon shaileyon kaa mishran paaya jaataa he
 At the bottom, a square or a platform of eight corners is made
 in chabutaron ke upar doosraa gol chabutara banaaya jaataa he

 But there was also a time in this period, when the forests of Mawflang were being empowered by the so-called elevators, which led to a continuous decline in Mawfalong forest between 2000 and 2005 with the help of outsiders

 Padmavati or Padmini was the queen of Ratna Singh, the king of Chittor
 is rajput rani ke naam kaa aitihaasik astitv bahut sandigdh he, or iskaa aitihaasik astitv to praayah itihaaskaaron dwaara kaalpanik sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 The main source of this name is the epic titled 'padmavat' by Malik Muhammad Jayasi
 anya jis kisi aitihaasik sroton yaa granthon main 'padmavati' yaa 'padmini' kaa varnan hua he ve sabhi 'padmavat' ke parvarti hai
 The name 'padmini' has been accepted mostly in the history texts, while Jayasi has explicitly accepted the name 'padmavati'
 jaaysi ke varnan se spasht hota he ki 'padmini' se unka bhi taatpary striyon kii ucchtam koti se hi he
 Jayasi has clearly written that King Gandharvasen had sixteen thousand Padmini queens, the best of which was Queen Champavati, who was Patarani
 isi champavati ke garbh se padmavati kaa janm hua tha
 Thus the name 'padmavati' is clearly accepted in the primary source of the story itself
 jaaysi ke anusaar padmavati sinhal dweep ke raja gandharvasen kii putree thi or chittod ke raja ratan sen yogi ke vesh main vahaan jaakar anek varshon ke praytn ke pashchaat uske saath vivaah kar ke use chittod le aayaa tha
 She was a unique beauty and Chittorgarh was invaded by the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji, upon hearing the description of her form by the poet-pundit-tantric Raghav Chetan, destined by Ratansen
 8 maah ke yuddh ke baad bhi allaudin khilji chittod par vijay praapt nahin kar sakaa to laut gaya or duusari baar akraman karke us ne chal se raja ratansen ko bandi banaaya or use lautaane kii shart ke rup main padmavati ko maanga
 Then deceit was also resorted to by Padmavati and with the help of gora-badal, King Ratansen was freed by being disguised with many heroes as Padmavati's associates in the palanquins
 parantu is chal kaa pataa chalate hi allaudin khilji ne prabal akraman kiya, jisamen dilli gayi praayah saare rajput yoddha maare gayi
 King Ratansen returned to Chittor but upon coming here he had to attack Kumbhalner and Devpal was killed in the war with Devpal, the ruler of Kumbhalner, but King Ratansen also returned to Chittor with great injuries and went to heaven
 udhar punah allaudin khilji kaa akraman hua
 Rani Padmavati along with sixteen hundred women was consumed by Jauhar and all the Rajput warriors were killed while opening the gate of the fort
 allaudin khilji ko raakh ke sivaa or kuch nahin mila
 Colonel Tod has repeated the same story in his history of Rajasthan with some manipulation in the above story of Jayasi
 mukhyatah bhaaton kii kathaon ke aadhaar par likhane ke kaaran karnal tod kaa varnan aitihaasik bahut kam rah gaya he
 He named Bhimsi instead of Raja Ratnasinh or Ratansen and he was also virtually Rana but not Rana Lakhmsi's uncle who was ruling the family as the child of Laxman Singh
 karnal tod ne lakshmana singh or uske sangrakshak ke rup main bhimsingh ke shashan kaa aarambh 1275 isvi main mana he; jabaki yah sarvagyaat baat he ki allaudin khilji kaa akraman 1303 isvi main hua tha
 Similarly, Col
 Tod has told Padmini the girl of Chauhan Vanshi Hamir Shankh of Sinhala Island
 in parivartanon ke sivaa shesh kahani apwaadon ko chhodkar praayah padmavat vaali hi he
 Rani Padmini is mentioned by Jain texts- Nabinandan Zenudhar, Chittai Charitra and Rayan Sehra between the 14th and 16th centuries
 tejpal singh dhama ne apane charchit shodhaparak upanyaas agni kii lapten main inhen jafana se prakashit granthon ke aadhaar par srilanka kii rajkumaari siddh kiya he
 His story is slightly different from Jayasi's Padmavat
 rani padmini, raja ratnasingh tathaa allaudin khilji ke akraman ko lekar itihaaskaaron ke bich kaaphi pehle se paryaapt manthan ho chukaa he
 In this context, the most quoted and certified Mahamaopadhyay Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha has been considered
 ojha ji ne padmavat kii katha ke sandarbh main spasht likhaa he ki "itihaas ke abhaav main logon ne padmavat ko aitihaasik pustak maan liya, parantu vastav main vah aajkal ke aitihaasik upanyaason kii si kavitabaddh katha he, jiskaa kalevar in aitihaasik baton par rachaa gaya he ki ratansen chittod kaa raja, padmini yaa padmavati uski raani or allaudin dilli kaa sultan tha, jisane ratansen se ladakar chittod kaa kila chhina tha
 Often everything else has been conceived to make the story interesting; Because Ratnasinha could not rule for a year, how can it be possible to become a yogi and go to Sinhaldwip and get married to the princess there
 uske samay sinhaladweep kaa raja gandharvasen nahin kintu raja kirtinishshank dev parakrambahu yaa bhuvnek bahu hona chahie
 There was no king named Gandharvasen in Sinhaldwip
 us samay tak kumbhalaner aabaad bhi nahin hua tha, to devpal vahaan kaa raja kaise mana jaay ? allaudin 8 baras tak chittod ke liye ladane ke baad niraash hokar dilli ko nahin lautaa kintu anumaan chah maheene lard kar usne chittod le liya tha, vah ek hi baar chittod par chadha tha, isliye duusari baar aane kii katha kalpit hi he
 " is prakaar yah spasht ho jaataa he ki jaaysi rachit padmavat mahakavy kii katha main aitihaasikta dhoondhna bahut had tak nirarthak hi he
 Some of the names are historical, but the events are mostly fictitious
 kuch ghatnaayen jo aitihaasik hai bhi unka sambandh 1303 isvi se na hokar 1531 isvi se he
 Similarly, the description of Colonel Todd is also largely historical
 is sandarbh main ojha ji kaa spasht kathan he ki "karnal tod ne yah katha visheshkar mewar ke bhaaton ke aadhaar par likhi he or bhaaton ne usko 'padmavat' se liya he
 Due to the absence of Ratnasinh behind Samar Singh in Bhat's books, Tad linked Padmini with Bhimsingh and considered it an incident of the time of Lakhmsi
 aise hi bhaaton ke kathananusaar taad ne lakhamasi kaa balak or mewar kaa raja hona bhi likh diya, parantu lakhamasi na to mewar kaa kabhi raja hua or na balak tha, kintu sisode kaa samant tha or us samay vriddhavastha ko pahunch chukaa tha, kyonki vah apane saat putron sahit apana namak adaa karne ke liye ratnasingh kii sena kaa mukhiya banakar allaudin ke saath kii ladaai main ladate hue maaraa gaya tha, jaisaa ki vikram samvath 1517 ke kumbhalgarh ke shilaalekh se upar batalaaya gaya he
 Similarly Bhimsi was not Lakhmsi's uncle, but grandfather, as found in the 'ekalingamahatmya' of Rana Kumbhakarna's time
 aisi dasha main taad kaa kathan bhi vishwaas ke yogya nahin ho saktaa
 If there is any root of the writings of 'padmavat', 'tithi Firishta' and the Rajasthan of Tad, it is only that Alauddin marched on Chittor and conquered it within six months' siege; King Ratnasinh was killed in this battle with many feudatories like Lakshman Singh, his queen Padmini along with many women died in the fire of Jauhar; Thus Chittor became a Muslim for a short time
 baaki bahudhaa sab baaten kalpana se khadi kii gai he
 " ojha ji ke bahu uddhrut uparyukt mat ko praayah sabhi itihaaskaaron ne sweekaar kiya he
 Dr
 Lal also wrote in his book 'history of the Khaljis, that after keeping the traditional narration of the story at bay, the naked truth is that Sultan Alauddin invaded Chittor in 1303 AD and after an eight-month long struggle he got it
 Authorized
 vir rajput yoddha aakrantaon se yuddh karte hue khet rahe or vir rajput striyaan johar kii jwaalaon main samadhisth ho gayin
 Amongst the women who became samadhi, there was possibly a queen of Ratnasinh, named Padmini
 in tathyon ke atirikt or sab kuch ek saahitiyik sanrachana he or uske liye aitihaasik samarthan nahin he
 Similar opinion is also of Dr
 SL Nagori and Jitesh Nagori
 yah chittod kaa pratham shaakaa mana gaya he
 It is said that Khilji hoisted his victory over the fort and killed 30,000 civilians there
 anek itihaaskaaron ne padmini ke naam tathaa astitv donon ko asweekaara he; parantu paryaapt vichaar ke baad dow0 aashirvadilal shrivastav tathaa dow0 gopinath sharma jaise anek itihaaskaaron ne kahani kii bahut si baton ko apramanik maanate hue bhi padmini ke astitv ko sweekrut kiya he, jaisaa ki ojha ji ke bhi uparyukt mat main vyakt hua he
 Dr
 Gopinath Sharma has written that "in our opinion, it is to be believed that the story tradition of Padmini begins with Padmavat of Jaisi, it is a complete illusion
 chhitaicharit main jo jaaysi se kai varshon purv likhaa gaya tha, padmini tathaa allaudin ke chittod akraman kaa varnan he
 In the blond-cloud quadrant of Haemartan; And this story has been written independently in the Padmini character of Labhodaya
 


 yah katha ek rajput pranali ke anuroop vishuddh tathaa swasth parampara ke rup main chali aayi he use sahaj main asweekaar karnaa thik nahin
 It is possible that many things have been practiced in different forms, from text to speech and from description style, but their basis cannot be found out from the truth
 sthapaty is baat kaa sakshi he ki chittod main padmini ke mahal hai or padmini taal he jo aaj bhi us vistrut tathaa vivadagrast mahila kii yaad dilaa rahe hai
 All the events given in relation to Padmini may not fit the test of truth, but the existence of Padmini, his understanding at the time of invasion, the leadership of Jauhar fast by him, etc
, have an independent significance
 " In fact, the main reason for the invasion and war of Alauddin Khilji was the imperial ambition of Alauddin and the military and commercial utility of Chittor
 gujarat, malwa, madhya pradesh, sanyukt praant, sindh aadi bhaagon ke vyapaarik maarg chittod se hokar guzarate the
 It is natural that a sultan like Alauddin Khilji would definitely want to gain authority over such an area
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki chittod akraman ke liye allaudin kaa pramukh aashay raajnneetik tha, parantu jab padmini kii sundarataa kaa haal use maaloom hua to usko lene kii uthkanthaa usamen adhik teevr ho gayi

 Outlining the limits of revivalism, he wrote in one of his articles that- There is nothing exuberant and extravagant in Ranade
 He refused to reap cheap notoriety by playing the part of an extremist
 He refused to mislead people by playing upon and exploiting the patriotic sentiments of the people
 He refused to be a party to methods which are crude, which have volume but no effect, and which are neither fool-proof nor knave-proof, and which break the back even of the most earnest and sincere servants of the country and disable them from further effort
 In short, Ranade was like the wise Captain who knows that his duty is not to play with his ship clever and masterful tricks, just for effect and show in the midst of the ocean, but to take it safely to its appointed port
 In short, Ranade was not a forged bank note and in worshipping him we have no feeling of kneeling before anything that is false
