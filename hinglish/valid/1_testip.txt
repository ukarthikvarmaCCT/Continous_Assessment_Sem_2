 Non-labor heatstroke is usually caused by medications that reduce vasodilation, sweating, and other heat-reducing mechanisms, such as anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, and diuretics
 In this situation, the body's tolerance to withstand extreme environmental temperatures may be quite limited, even at rest

 The presence of other signs and symptoms related to hyperthermia such as extraparamid symptoms that are symptoms of neuroleptic venous syndrome and the absence of signs and symptoms commonly related to infection fever are also considered important in diagnosing
 agar fever kam karne vaali dawaaen sharir ke taapmaana ko kam karti hai, yahaan tak ki taapmaana saamaanya rup se puri tarah kam nahin hota tab bhi atitaap apvarjit hota he
 In cases where heat stress causes physical exertion, hot environments, or wearing protective equipment, it can be stopped or reduced by repeated resting, so that the body becomes hydrated
 And body temperature can be monitored carefully

 In labor-based thermodynamics, studies have shown that although it has practical limitations, sitting in cold water is the most effective cooling technique and the biggest factor of consequence is the degree and duration of hyperthermia
 No better cooling method has been found for non-labor heatstroke
 jab sharir kaa taapmaana 40 centegrade tak pahunchataa he yaa agar prabhavit vyakti behosh ho gaya he or bhram kii sthiti kaa sanket de rahaa to aise atitaap kii sthiti ko apaat chikitsa mana jaataa he or iske liye uchit chikitsa suvidha ke tahat ilaaj kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 The words rhymed in the lion of Ghazal are called kafia and the words repeated in the lions are called radif

 Kafia occurs in both Egyptians of Malta and the latter line of Kafias in the second line of lions

 ghazal ke sabase achche sher ko shahe bait kaha jaataa he
 Such a collection of ghazals is called Diwan in which there should be at least one ghazal for every week
 urdu kaa pehla dewan shaayar kuli qutubashah he
 Ghazals are of two types based on rhyme - bhav ke aadhaar par bhi gazalen do prakaar kii hoti hai- Ghazals began as a poetic genre of Arabic literature
 arabi bhashaa main kahi gayi gazalen vastav main naam ke hi anuroop thi arthath usamen auraton se baaten yaa uske bare main baaten hoti thi
 After coming from Arabic to Persian literature, this genre remained unchanged at the level of craftsmanship, but in terms of the narrative, they overtook them
 unamem baat to daihik yaa bhautik prem kii hi kii gai kintu uske arth vistaar dwaara daihik prem ko aadhyatmik prem main badal diya gaya
 Arabic love became popular in Persian
 farsi ghazal main premi ko sadik or premika ko mabood kaa darja mil gaya
 Sufi seekers played a decisive role in giving Ghazal its form
 sufi sadhana virah pradhan sadhana he
 Therefore, in the Persian ghazals, the separation aspect took precedence rather than coincidence
 farsi se urdu main aane par bhi ghazal kaa shilpagat rup jyon kaa tyon sweekaar kar liya gaya lekin kathy bhartiya ho gaya
 But contrary to the common concept of North India, Indian ghazals originated in the Deccan during the Bahmani Sultanate where ghazals influenced by songs were written
 bhashaa kaa naam rekhta padaa
 Vali Dakani, Siraj Daud etc
 were the poets of this tradition who in a way carried forward the tradition of Amir Khusro
 dakkini urdu ke gazalakaaron ne arabi farsi ke badale bhartiya pratikon, kavy roodhiyon, evam saanskrithik prishthbhumi ko lekar rachana kii
 At that time, the language of royalty in North India was Persian, so when Ghazal came to North India, Persian influence on it started increasing
 gaalib jaise urdu ke shreshth gazalkaar bhi farsi gazalon ko hi mahatvapurn maanate rahe or urdu gajal ko farsi ke anuroop banane kii koshish karte rahe
 Later, during the Dawood era, the influence of Persian was somewhat reduced
 ikbaal kii aarambhik gazalen isi prakaar kii he
 Later, due to political conditions, the influence of Persian on the Urdu ghazals started increasing again
 1947 ke baad isamen punah kami aane lagi
 Many Hindi writers adopted this mode

 chhatrapati sambhaji raaje yaa shambhaji maratha samraat or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke uttaradhikari
 At that time, he played a major role in ending the rule of Mughal emperors Aurangzeb Bijapur and Golconda from Hindustan, the most powerful enemies of the Marathas
 sambhaji raaje apni shauryata ke liye kaaphi prasiddh the
 Sambhaji Maharaj waged 140 wars during his short reign and one of the main things in this was that his army was not defeated in a single battle
 unke parakram kii vajah se pareshaan ho kar dilli ke badshaah aurangzeb ne kasam khaayi thi ke jab tak chhatrapati sambhaji pakde nahin jaayenge, wo apana kimonsh sar par nahin chadhayega
 Chhatrapati Sambhaji, at the age of nine years, had accompanied Punishashlok Chhatrapati Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the famous Agra visit
 aurangzeb ke bandigrih se nikal, punyashlok chhatrapati shri chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke maharashtra waapas lautne par, mughalon se samjhaute ke falswaroop, sambhaji mughal samrat dwaara raja ke pad tathaa panchhajari mansab se vibhooshit hue
 He was appointed to the Mughal cantonment of Aurangabad, along with the Maratha army
 yugpravartak raja ke putr rahete unako yah naukari maanya nahin thi
 But being at the very beginning of the establishment of Hindu Swarajya, and obeying the order of Father Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj, he did so much responsibility at the age of 9 but insulting work with patience
 unhone apane umr ke keval 14 saal main unhone buddhabhushan, nakhsikh, nayikabhed tathaa saatshatak yah teen sanskrit granth likhe the
 This sensitive crown prince was greatly damaged by the coronation of Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj and some of the people in the Ashtapradhan cabinet established after Hindu Swarajya
 parakramee hone ke baavjood unhen anek ladaayeeyonse dur rakhaa gaya
 By nature, Sambhaji Raje, who was sensitive, could go to the Mughals as per the orders of his father Shivaji Maharaj ji so that he could mislead them
 kyun ki usee samay maratha sena dakshin disha ke digvijay se lauti thi or unhe phir se josh main aane ke liye samay chaiye tha
 Therefore, Punishashlok Chatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj ji had sent him to mislead the Mughals, it was a monarchy
 baad main chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ji ne hi unhe mughaalo se mukt kiya
 But in this effort, he failed to take his wife Rani Durgabai and Bahin Godavari with him
 punyashlok chhatrapati shivaji shri maharaj kii mrityu ke baad kuch logon ne dharmaveer chaatrapati shri sambhaji maharaj ke anuj rajaraam ko singhasanacin karne kaa praytn kiya
 However, this place failed due to the commander Mohite and on 10 January 1681 Sambhaji Maharaj was duly crowned
 isi varsh aurangzeb ke vidrohi putr akbar ne dakshin bhaag kar dharmaveer chaatrapati shri sambhaji maharaj kaa aashray grahan kiya
 In addition to fighting with the Mughals, the Portuguese, the English and other enemies alone, they also had to fight the enemies under them
 rajaraam ko chhatrapati banane main asafal rahane vaale rajaraam samarthakone aurangzeb ke putr akbar se rajya par akraman kar ke use mogul samrajya kaa ankit banane kii guzarish karne vaala patr likhaa
 But due to the greatness of Dharmaveer Chhatrapati Shri Sambhaji Maharaj and his dependents Akbar sent the letter to Chhatrapati Sambhaji
 is rajdroh se krodhit chhatrapati srisambhaji maharaj ne apane saamanto ko mrityudand diya
 However, he also built the Samadhi of a Samant named Balaji Awaji, whose letter of apology was received by Chhatrapati Sambhaji after the death of those feudal lords
 1683 main usne portugaliyon ko parajeet kiya
 At the same time, he stayed at Sangameshwar for some state reason
 jis din wo raigarh ke liye prasthaan karne vaale the usee din kuch gramastho ne apni samasya unhen arjeet kerani chaahi
 Due to which Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj kept the remaining army with only 200 soldiers and sent the army to Rayagada
 usee vakt unke ek fitur jinako unhone vatandaaree dene se inkaar kiya tha, mogul sardaar mukarab khan ke saath gupt raste se 5000 ke fuj ke saath vahaan pahunche
 This was the path that only the Marathas knew
 isliye sambhaji maharaj ko kabhi nahin laga tha ke shatru is or se aa sakegaa
 He tried to fight, but in the face of such a large army, the retaliation of 200 soldiers could not work and he was taken captive with his friend and sole advisor Kavikalash
 aurangzeb ne donon kii jubaan katwa di, ankhen nikaal di
 Aurangzeb was killed on 11 March 1689 on the Hindu New Year day by splitting the bodies of both
 kintu aisa kehete hai ki hatya purv aurangzeb ne chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj se kaha ke mere 4 putron main se ek bhi tumhaare jaisaa hota to sara hindusthan kab kaa mogul sultanate main samaaya hota
 When the pieces of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj were thrown into the river of Tulapur, the people living on that shore gathered them together and added them to the sila, after which they were ceremonially endowed
 aurangzeb ne sochaa tha kii marathi samrajya chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke mrityu pashchaat khatm ho jayega
 Due to the murder of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, all the Marathas came together and started fighting
 at: aurangzeb ko dakkhan main hi pranatyag karnaa padaa
 His dream of winning the Deccan was buried in this land
 itane bade saahsee or uttam shaasha hone ke baavjood kam jaankaree ke kaaran unka charitra ek charitraheen tathaa vyasnee raja kaa dikhaaya gaya he
 It is quite surprising that it was written about Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj 100 years after his death, the struggle of Sambhaji Maharaj and Aurangzeb was a struggle for power
 dharmaveer chaatrapati shri sambhaji maharaj kaa ye balidaan or unako peeda dene kaa kaam mughalone aurangzeb ke kehane par ek mahine tak chaalu rakhaa or unako mahinabhar tadpate rahe or aakhir main unke sharir ke pairon se lekar gardan tak tukde tukde karke maar daalaa| ye sab hone se pehle crurkarma or dharmaandh aurang ne unhen apana hindudharm tyaag kar mughalonka muslim dharm apnaanen kii maang rakhi thi lekin yugpravartak hindu raja chhatrapati shri shivajirajen kaa betaa or apane hindu dharmapar puri nishtha or shradhdha rakhanenvase dharmaveer chhatrapati shri sambhajirajenne ye maang dhudka di or islam kaa swikaar katai na karane kaa nishchay aurang ko bataa diya tha| issen krodh main aakar aurangzeb ne unako pura mahinabhar tadpa tadpa ke maaraa tha| ye pura mahina

 In India, he was defeated by Shershah Suri
