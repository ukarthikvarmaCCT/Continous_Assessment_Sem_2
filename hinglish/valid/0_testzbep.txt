 Narendramandal or Nareshmandal was a former Legislature of India
 yah britishkaleen bharat ke vidhaan mandal kaa ek ucch va shahi sadan tha
 It was founded in 1920 by the royal Farman of the King of Britain, Emperor George V
 iski sthapana karne kaa mul uddeshy britishkaleen bharat kii riyasaton ko ek vidhanmandal rupi manch pradaan karnaa tha taaki british-sangrakshit riyasaton ke saashak british sarkaar se apni aashaaon or akanshaaon ko prastut kar saken
 The Isski meeting used to take place in the third chamber of the "parliament House" which has now been converted into a "parliamentary Library"
 is sadan ko 1947 main british raaj ke samaapan ke pashchaat bharat kii swatantraaa va ganraajya kii sthapana ke baad visthapit kar diya gaya
 Narendra Mandal was called "chamber of Princes" in English which was called "narendramandal / Nareshmandal" in Hindi
 hindi main ise "rajkumaron kaa kaksh" athva "shahi / rajkeey kaksh" yaa "shahi sadan" ke rup main anuvaadit kiya ja saktaa he
 In English, "chamber" means "chamber", "cell" or "room", and "princess" means "prince" which denotes the state of an object
 "narendramandal / nareshmandal" shabd do sanskrit shabdon se bana he, "narendra / naresh" arthath 'shaasha' or "mandal" arthath 'samooh' yaa 'sabha'
 Hence the term "narendramandal" means "assembly of rulers" or "assembly of kings"
 narendra mandal kii sthapana san 1920 main britain ke raja samraat jorge ke shahi farmaan dwaara 23 disambar 1919 ko hui thi jab 1919 ke bharat sarkaar adhinium ko great britain ke sansad main paarit kar diya gaya or use britain ke raja dwaara shahi sweekruti mil gai thi
 With the establishment of this House, that policy of the British Government also came to an end, under which she used to keep the British-protected Indian princely states from each other and also from other countries of the world
 narendra mandal kii pehali baithak 8 farvari 1921 ko hui thi
 In the early days, this House had a total of 120 members

 This privilege was only achieved by important and meaningful sessions
 anya bache hue 12 siten, aavarti aadhaar par, aanya 127 aasthai riyasaton kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 In this representation system, out of the total 562 princely states of India, there was no place to represent 327 small princely states
 in asarthak rayasaton kaa narensh mandal main main pratinidhitiv nahin kiya jaataa tha
 Apart from this, some very important princely states refused to subscribe to it
 is sadan kii baithken " sansad bhawan " ke tisare kaksh main hoti thi jise ab "saanshdeey pustkaalay" main parivartit kar diya gaya he
 This meeting was convened only once a year, under the chairmanship of Rajapratinidhi of British India
 in baithkon main riyasaton ke saashak british sarkaar ke samaksh aapane prastaav rakhte the
 The original purpose of the ISKE formation was to provide a platform to the British-protected Indian princely states where they could present their hopes and aspirations to the British government

 Odissi is one of the two famous Greek epics
 elliod main homer ne trogen yuddh tathaa uske baad kii ghatnaon kaa varnan kiya he jabaki odisi main try ke patan ke baad ethaka ke raja odisius kii, jise ulisys naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, us romaanchak yatra kaa varnan he jisamen vah anek kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karte hue, 10 varsh baad apane ghar pahunchataa he
 Odyssey bc Written in the eighth century
 yah kahan likhi gai is sambandh main mana jaataa he ki yah is samay ke yunaan adhikrut main sagar tat ionia main likhi gai jo ab turki kaa bhaag he
 Odesi tells the saga of the daring deeds that occur when returning to the homeland after the Battle of Troy, a mythical hero named Odes or Ulysse
 jis prakaar hindu ramayana main lanka vijay kii kahani padhakar aanandit hote hai
 Similarly, the story of the Greek hero Ulysses in the Odyssey is delightful
 try kaa rajkumaar sparta kii rani hellen kaa apharan kar try nagar le gaya
 To avenge this insult, all the kings and heroes of Greece invaded Troy
 par na nagar kaa phatak tutaa or na pracheer hi laanghi ja saki
 Finally the Greek army did a trick
 ek lakdi kaa khokhla ghoda pahiayukt patle par jadaa gaya
 Leaving him, they returned from their ships
 troy ke logon ne sochaa ki unani apane devtaa kii murti chhodkar niraash ho chale gaye
 When they pulled it into the city, the archway of the main gate had to be cut
 raatri ko jab troy khushiyon manaa rahaa tha, khokhli ashv murti se unani sainikon ne nikalakar chupchaap troy kaa phatak khol diya
 The Greek army, which did not go back but hid nearby, entered Troy
 ek hellen ke peeche troy nasht ho gaya thik vaise hi jaise sita ke peeche ravan kii swarnamayi lanka nasht hui thi
 This created the phrase 'the Trojan Horse' in English
 ‘odesi’ manishi greek captain odesus kii saahasik vaapasi yatra kii gaatha he
 While returning from Troy, his ship fell into a storm
 vah bahut dinon tak idhar udhar bhatakta rahaa
 After this he returned to his country
 mangalacharan - he devi, tu us kushal maanav odesius kii katha gane kii shakti de jisane try ke durg ko dharashayi kar diya or jo saare sansar main bhatakta rahaa, jisane vividh jatiyon or nagaron ko dekha tathaa uttal samudr kii laharon par praanon kii raksha ke liye ghor ksht sahan kiya
 This story is told in twenty-four sergos, in which canto continued to suffer and wander due to the wrath of warrior Odesius Varuna for ten years after the war in one
 is kshtmay kaal ke antim bhaag main katha prarambh hoti he
 In canto four, Telemakus meets Minilas and Helen
 sarg nau main, odesian dwaara siconijon ke yuddh kii kahani kaa varnan he
 Odesius said when the war of war ended, on the way to the home we invaded the Syconies, were defeated
 nau din nau raat lagaataar uttari hawa ke dhakke se hamaare ran-pot raste se bahut dur bhatak gayi
 Finally, we reached the land of Lotus - this lotus is a sweet plant, due to which our sailors were engulfed in utter bliss
 jabardastee unhen ghasitkar pot par laayaa gaya
 Then later we reached the land of a Nayavan demons and were imprisoned in the cave of a demon by our foolishness
 phir chaturata se use sharaab pilaakar uski aankh bade kunde se phod di evam savere rakshas ne jab guphaadwar apni bhedon ko baahar nikalne ke liye kholaa tab ek-ek bhed ke saath apane ko baandhakar ham nikal gayi
 This demon was the son of the ruler of the sea and earthquake Varun
 isi se varun ham par cruddh ho gayi
 Canto thirteen describes the management of Odesian's visit by the Athetya king
 sarg ekkis main ethnay dwaara pinilopi ko swayamvar kaa suzav kii katha he
 Canto 24 is the story of the evil Kumari's souls in Adhumalok or their relatives, the plan of war and the beginning and end of war and peace and peace
 odisi 24 anuvaakon main vibhakt he or iskaa ghatnakaal 42 din kaa he
 In the initial verse, the guardian of Odysseus at the assembly of the gods complains to Athena Zeus that Odysseus left Troy 10 years ago but has not yet reached home; Because, a demon named Calypso detains him in an island called Augizia, while Pinatapi's gatherers in Ithaca are not only creating hustle but also looting Odysseus' property
 jiyas ethina ko yathavivek kaary karne kii anumati de detaa he or vah odisius ke putr telemacas ke sanmukh menter ke rup main upasthit hokar use paraamarsh detii he ki vah apane ghar main pinalopi ke panigrahathiyon kaa pravesh roak de tathaa swayan apane pita kaa pataa lagane ke liye yatra kare
 In the second, third and fourth paragraphs, the story of Telemacus is played
 telemacas ek sabha kaa aayojan kar usamen pinalopi ke panigrahalarthiyon kii bhartsana karata he or menter rupi ethina kii sahaayta se ek jahaaj praapt karke apni maan ko bataae bina hi yatra par chal padataa he
 Along with Mentor, he reaches Pilos and meets the old Nestor where he learns the true details of the Trajan War
 pilos se vah sparta jaataa he
 There, i meet Helen's wife Helen and prepare to return home
 uske turant baad kavi ethaka sthit odisius ke prasaad kii ghatnaayen prastut karata he
 On one hand Pinlopi is troubled by his son's sudden disappearance, and on the other hand his entourage sends a ship under the supervision of Antinus to the port, arranging that Telemacus be killed as soon as he returns so that Odysseus' possessions and his occupation of Pinelopi Possible paanchaven anuvaak main pun: devataaon kii sabha kaa drishy he jisamen ethina ek baar phir odisius kii mukti kaa praytn karti he
 Zeus sends Hermes to Calypso, and at her insistence, she makes a raft of trees and sends Odysseus to Ithaca
 17 din tak taron kii sahaayta se yatra karne ke baad jaise hi odisius fiaisia dweep ke nikat pahunchataa he, samudr ke devtaa posidon ke krodh ke kaaran uskaa bedaa tut jaataa he or vah laharon main doobane utaraate lagata he
 Then Leucothia, the nymph of the sea, gives him a mortal handkerchief with the help of which he finally reaches Fiacia
 chathe anuvaak main fiaisia ke raja elsinas kii beti nausika swapn main ethina se aadesh paakar agali subah samudratat par apane kapade dhone jaati he jahaan uski bhent nange odisius se hoti he
 In the seventh verse, she brings him home with his clothes on
 aathven anuvaak main raja elsinas darbar main odisius kaa swaagat karata he
 On this occasion, Bhat sings a Trajan-war-related song, and Odysseus starts to cry distracted
 raja usase rone kaa kaaran poochta he to odisius ko apana vaastavik parichay dena padataa he
 In the next three passages, everyone recounts his 10-year thrilling journey after the fall of Odysseytrae
 12wein anuwak main odiciamas fiaisia ke jaadui jahaaj par ethaka pahunchataa he jahaan ethina ek gaderiye ke rup main usase milti he or use bhikhaari ke rup main parivartit kar detii he taaki uski patni ke panigrahanarthi use pahachaanakar koi haani na pahunchaa saken
 In the 13th verse, Athena dispatches Odysseus to his suitor and goes to Sparta himself, and orders Telemacus to return to Ithaca quickly
 14wein anuvaak main odisius tathaa shookarpal kii baatcheet he
 In the 15th episode, Telemacus escapes the conspiracy of his mother's entreaties and returns home safely
 16wein anuvaak main telemacas shookarpal ke ghar main apane pita ko pahchaan letaa he
 Later, the father plans to get rid of Pinelupi's diacritics
 17wein tathaa 18wein anuvaak main bhikshukveshi odisius apane prasaad main pahunchataa he jahaan uskaa purana kutta ergas use pahachaanakar khushi ke maare dam tod detaa he
 At the same time, Odysseus sees the rationale of Pinlopi's attendants in the palace, which also makes the proper role of his terrible act of killing them later
 19wein anuvaak main odisia tathaa pinalopi kii aamane saamne baatcheet hoti he parantu pinalopi apane pati ko pahchaan nahin paati, jabaki uski puraani dhai uriclia uske pair main bachapan main bane kshatchihn ko dekhakar use pahchaan jaati he
 In the 20th verse, Odysseus wakes up overnight thinking of many things due to anger
 21 wein anuvaak main pinalopi apane panigrahanarthiyon ko chunauti detii he ki ve sab pari pari odisius ke dhanush kaa chilla chadhaakar is tarah tir chalaaen ki vah vishaal vriksh main tange 12 chhallon ke bich se nikal jaae
 All fail, but the beggar Odysseus shoots arrows from between the rings
 22 wein anuvaak main mahakavy kaa charmotkarsh he
 Odysseus kills all of Pinloopy's diacritics with arrows
 koi bhi ek, bachakar nikal nahin paata, kyonki vishaal kaksh ke sabhi daravaajein pehle hi band kar die gaye the 23wein anuvaak main pinalopi apane pati ko pahachaanati he or donon ke milan kaa hridaygrahi evam marmasparshi drishy saamne aata he
 In the last or 24th chapter of the Maha Kavya, which some critics consider to be a projectile, the angel Mercury carries the souls of all the descendants of Pinloopy to the lower and infested regions of hell where they are given various kinds of tragic punishments
 isi bich odisius nagar ke baahar kheton main jaakar apane pita larties se miltaa he
 Finally, there is a grand feast to commemorate Odysseus's return home and the script concludes with information that ithaka is established
 elliod kaa kathanak mahaj 50 dinon kaa he - dasven varsh ke antim do maas ke andar kii ghati ghatnaayen
 If the plot had started from the beginning of the story, it should have started with the coincidence of Lida and Hans
 par homer katha ke antim bhaag ko pakadta he
 In between, he refers to the earlier story, not even in a sequence
 greek shrotasmaj ko katha pehle hi se gyaat he
 With this he does not know any difficulty, otherwise the first part of the story will be clear to an unknown person only once he recites the entire poem
 iliyat ke bare main duusari baat yah dhyaan main rakhane kii he ki uskaa vishay jaisaa ki mangalacharan se spasht he, ekiles ke krodh kaa gaan he
 Where this anger ends after its peak
 usase kuch aage tak, arthath is krodh ke pratyaksh fal petraclus kii mrityu evam apratyaksh fal hectares kii mrityu tak, chalakar katha samaapt ho jaati he par ekiles kii mrityu, try kaa dhwans aadi is mahakavy main nahin aate hai
 Homer keeps 'too The Point' very strictly on the theme declared in his epic - not a little bit
 is ghor sanyam kaa hi parinaam he katha-yaa ‘vishay kii ekta’ 
 Each event is seated within the entire design with tightly related associations
 bhartiya mahakavyon main isi ekta evam sangati kaa abhaav he evam sara dhaanchaa dhili-dhaali katha vyavastha se purna he
 The subject of Valmiki's Ramayana is Polastyavadh, but the events involved in it are connected with very loose sources
 mahabharat main to yah ‘ekta’ bilkul nahin - vah to vishwakosh kii style main likhaa gaya he
 In Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas, it is definitely like 'jatiili Ekta' and 'associative consistency' like Homer
 jahaan tak vishay kii ekta evam prabhavanviti kaa prashn he tulsidas kii samta koi bhi bhartiya kavi, chaahe vah kalidas hi kyon na ho, nahin kar saktaa
 This thing is being written here in Abhidhartha
 homer ekiles ke krodh evam uske vikaas kaa pratifal evam varnan 9 sargon main karata he or katha ko uske pratyaksh, apratyaksh falon tak le jaakar samaapt karata he
 If he had been tempted to narrate further events, till the death of the Achilles and the ruin, then there would not have been a strong structural unity in poetry
 dhaanchaa dhilaa ho jaataa
 Aristotle praised Homer's genius in those chapters of 'poetics' and taught Homer to emulate his ideal, where he discusses the 'three Unities' and influences
 greek sahitya main dhaanchaa par bahut hi adhik jor diya gaya he
 This form is evident in the geometric consistency of the law, their sculpture, theatrical etc
 unhone chand ko bhavanubhuti evam alankaar se kam mahatva nahin diya
 This trend is not only present in Homer, but in Homer itself
 elliod main sara ‘acshan’ vrittakar he
 Where it starts, it comes and ends there
 jin sanskaron ne greek tragedy ko dhaanchaa evam bhavbhumi pradaan kii, ve sanskaar greekon kii jaateey nidhi hai or ve hi homer kii pratibha main bhi praan sthaapan karte hai
 From this there is a structural and emotional resemblance in the Homeland and Tragedy literature of the period 
 greek tragedy ke dhaanche kaa sanyaman teen tatva - ‘ek desh’, ‘ek kaal’, evam ‘ek vyapaar yaa vishay’-karte hai
 In the Iliad, the 'country' is the same, that is, the whole event takes place on the palaces of Troy and the beach in front
 ‘kaal’ bhi ek hi he, kyonki mahakavy kaa ghatnasutra lagaataar 50 din kii avadhi kaa he
 That is, a continuous unbroken form of 'kaal' is given - by holding the last 50 days of the 10th year
 kavyavrutt ko 10 varshon kii sataha par na failaakar vah 50 dinon ke andar hi samet letaa he
 The trade or subject is also the same - the anger of Echiles, its mitigation and its fruit in the form of epilogue
 bas, yaheen mahakavy samaapt ho jaataa he
 The subject of Odyssey is broad
 mahakavy kaa nayak odesius try yuddh ke baad 10 varsh tak bhatakta rahaa
 This epic also begins with the last part of this decade
 dhaanchaa thik elliod jaisaa he
 In the 50-day event of the Iliad, the present is the predominance - the purpose of the poet is to describe what happened in those 50 days
 purv kii ghatnaayen raah chalati charchaa-si kahin-kahin aa jaati hai
 But this is not the case in Odessa
 odesi kaa vishay hi he ‘odesius kaa dukhamay bhraman’
 Therefore, this is the aim of this 10-year tour
 vah elliod kii tarah hi dashak ke antim chor par prarambh hota he avashya, parantu uskaa uddeshy ‘vartmaan’ se adhik ‘ateet’ se sambandhit he
 Homer therefore uses flashback-technics of modern films
 mahakavy kaa armbh hota he 10wein varsh main, jab odesius apsara kelipso ke dweep se yatra shuru karata he or uskaa bhagn pot dub jaataa he evam vah nasika ke desh main bahakar lag jaataa he
 The king of there narrates the Ram story of his 9 years in canto from 9 to 12
 ‘purv-smriti’ takanic isi 9wein se 12wein sargon main he
 But even in the womb of this former memory, there is the 'antecedent memory' in the 11th canto, when he narrates the balance of the story of the war of triumphs to Aciles
 odesi kaa kaal sanghathan bada hi pechida he
 In the womb of 'present', 'east' and in the womb of that East lies 'ante'
 samooche kaal-bandh ko ‘mukul-patr-bandh’ kii sangya di ja sakati he
 In the bud, there is a second layer inside a layer of petals, a third layer lies inside the second
 usee bhanti odesi kaa kaal-bandh he
 This time-bound duality becomes complicated because the 'country' of Odyssey is not one
 odesi kaa vishay he, ‘bhayankar samudr-bhraman evam guhaagaman’
 Hence, the centers of trade become two
 ek to he ithaika jahaan uski rani pinilopi uski pratiksha main baithi he or uske putr-kaltr uske shatruon se ghire hai
 The second is Odessa's own and its floating position on the sea surface
 in do ‘deshon’ ke ghatnaon sanchaalan hota he mahaan sutaradhar zeeyas dwaara
 Even if there is no 'unity of the country', the unity of the subject or business exists in the same truncated way as in the 'iliad'
 kavi badi saavdhaanee se ek ghatana kii parat main duusari ghatana rakhkar samooche vyapaar kii sangati evam sudaulata kii raksha badi dhirta se karata he
 The content of the Iliad is limited
 isi se tragedy kaa pattern baith gaya

 The duration of symptoms varies and on average they show up to 28 days and usually for at least a week
 in lakshanon ke anishchit swaroop ke kaaran, aksar unhen echivi sankraman ke sanketon ke rup main manyata nahin di jaati
 Due to the uncertain nature of these symptoms, they are often not recognized as signs of HIV infection
 Regardless of whether patients go to their doctor or to a hospital, they will often be misdiagnosed assuming they suffer from the more common infectious diseases in which the same symptoms are seen
 iske parinamswaroop, echivi sankraman kaa nidaan karne ke liye in praathmik lakshanon kaa prayog nahin kiya jaataa kyonki ve sabhi marizon main viksit nahin hote or inamen se anek lakshan anya adhik aam bimariyon ke kaaran bhi dikhaai de sakate hai
 However, identification of this syndrome can be important because the patient is very infected during this period

 Nearby tissues that contain substantial amounts of CD4 + t cells can also become infected and bacterial particles can accumulate both in uninfected cells and as free bacteria
 is charan main jo vyakti hai, ve abhi bhi sankramak hai
 During this time, CD4 + CD45RO + t cells carry most of the bacterial load
 jab sidi4+ tii koshikaon kii sankhya 200 koshikaayen prati μl ke aavashyak str se neeche gir jaati he, to koshikaon kii madhyasthata se praapt pratirohak kshamta samaapt ho jaati he or anek prakaar ke avasarwaadi rogaanuon se hone vaale sankraman dikhaai dene lagate hai

 HIV can infect many types of resistant cells, such as CD4 + t cells, macrophages, and microglial cells
 The virion envelope on the target cell for entry of HIV-1 into macrophages and CD4 + t is mediated by the interactions of glycoproteins with CD4 molecules and with chemokine receptors

 They appear to be the first cells to be infected by HIV and are also the source of HIV production when a patient is deficient in CD4 + cells
 macrophesso or microglayal koshikaayen echivi dwaara kendriya snaayu tantra main sankramit kii jane vaali koshikaayen hai
 In the gonads and glands of hiv-infected patients, macrophages coalesce into multi-centralized giant cells, which produce large amounts of bacteria

 However, the use of only receptors does not explain bacterial follow-up because not all R5 bacteria are able to use CCR5 on a macrophage for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which Probably forms a repository which, when the number of CDR4 + t cells reaches very low levels Maintains Nkramn
 kuch log echivi ke vishisht khinchaavon ke prati pratirodhi hote hai
 For example, those with CCR5-Δ32 mutations are resistant to infection with the R5 bacterium because this mutation prevents HIV from binding to this receptor, reducing its ability to infect target cells

 It is currently believed that when bacteria are encased in the mucosa, they play an important role by transmitting HIV to T-cells
 aisa vishwaas he ki epaized-1 kii upasthiti, jo prakritik rup se tantrikakoshikaon main hoti he, echivi dwaara koshika ke sankraman ko rokatii he
 Shortly after the bacterial capsid enters the cell, a fermenter called reverse transcriptase liberates the single-stranded RNA genome from the corresponding bacterial proteins and replicates in a complementary DNA molecule

 During bacterial duplication, integrated DNA is transcribed into provirus mrna, which is then added to small fragments
 ye chote tukade centre se koshikadravya main bheje jate hai, jahaan unhen niamak protein tieti or aaraivi main anuvaadit kiya jaataa he
 When this newly formed REV protein aggregates at the center, it binds to the bacterial mrna and allows RNA not added to the fragments to move from the center, where they otherwise persist until added to the fragments

 Only those samples considered hiv-positive and indicative of HIV infection are repetitively reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by Western blot
 Samples that are repetitively elisa-responsive sometimes provide an uncertain Western blot result, which may be an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person, or non-specific responses in an uninfected person

 At home temperature, it is colorless, tasteless and odorless with a light blue hue in liquid form
 kai padaarth, jal main ghul jate hai or ise saamanytah saarvbhaumik vilaayak ke rup main sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 Because of this, the water present in nature and the water used are rarely pure and some of its properties may be slightly different from pure matter
 haalanki, aise kai yogic hai jo ki anivaary rup se, agar puri tarah nahin, jal main aghulansheel he
 Water is the only thing that is found naturally in the normal three states of matter - see chemical properties for other things
 Water is essential for life on Earth
 jal aam taur par, maanav sharir ke 55% se lekar 78% tak kaa nirmaan karata he
 Like many substances, water can take many forms, which are broadly classified by the phase of the substance
 taral pravastha jal ke roopon main sabase aam he or yah vah rup he jise aam taur par "jal" shabd dwaara ankit kiya jaataa he
 The solid phase of water is known as ice and usually takes the form of a solid, mixed crystal-like structure such as ice cube, or softly integrated granular crystals such as ice
 thos H2O ke vibhinn prakaar ke crystalia or anaakaar swaroop kii suchi ke liye, barf lekh dekhen
 jal kii gasiy pravastha ko vaashp janaa jaataa he or ise jal ke ek paardarshee badal kaa vinyas dhaaran karne se pahachaanaa jaataa he
 The fourth phase of water, supercritical fluid, which is not common in comparison to the other three forms, rarely occurs in nature
 jab jal ek vishesh sookshm taapmaana or ek vishesh sookshm dabaav par pahunch jaataa he to taral or gas pravastha ek samroop drav pravastha main mil jaati hai, jab gas or taral, donon ke gun maujuud hote hai
 Since under extreme temperatures or pressures, water becomes extremely fine, almost never occurring naturally
 jal ke, swaabhaavik rup se atyant sookshm hone kaa ek udhaaharan gahare pani ke hydrothermal vent ke sabase garm hisse, jisamen jal ko jwalamukhi plum dwaara sookshm taapmaana tak garm kiya jaataa he or yah sagar kii charam gaharaai main kuchal dene vaale vajan kii vajah se sookshm dabaav ko praapt karata he, jahaan jwalamukhi kaa mukh sthit he
 In natural waters, almost all hydrogen atom isotopes are protium, 1H
 Heavy water is water in which hydrogen is replaced by its heavy isotope, deuterium 2 H
 It is chemically similar to normal water but is not identical
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki duretium kaa nabhik protium kii tulana main duguna he or is tarah urja kii bonding main or hydrogen bonding main spasht matbhed kaa kaaran banataa he
 Heavy water is used in the nuclear reactor industry to moderate neutrons

 ek udhaaharan he lit water riector, yah jataane ke liye ki riector main halke jal kaa upyog hota he
 Water is a chemical substance with a chemical formula: a molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms bound to one atom of oxygen
 saamaanya parivesh ke taapmaana or dabaav main jal ek beswad, bina gandh kaa taral padaarth he or choti maatra main berang prakat hota he, haalanki aatanrik rup se isamen halkaa nila rang dekha ja saktaa he
 Ice also appears colorless and the vapor is essentially invisible as a gas
 maanak sthitiyon main jal mukhya rup se ek taral hota he, jise aavadhik talika main oxigen parivaar ke anya samaan hidride ke saath uske sambandh ke kaaran purvanumaan nahin lagaaya jaataa
 iske alaava, aavadhik talika main oxigen ko ghere hue tatva, nitrogen, fluorine, phosphorus, sulfur or chlorine, sabhi, hydrogen ke saath maanak sthitiyon ke tahat gaison kaa nirmaan karne ke liye sanyukt ho jate hai
 The reason water is in liquid form is that oxygen in it is more electronegative than all other elements, with the exception of fluorine
 Oxygen attracts electrons more vigorously than hydrogen, leading to a net positive charge on the hydrogen atoms and a net negative charge on the oxygen atom
 The presence of a charge on each of these atoms gives a pure dipole moment to each molecule of water
 dipol kii vajah se pani ke anuon ke bich yah aakarshan, vyaktigat anuon ko ek saath kareeb khinchataa he, jisase in anuon ko alag karnaa or adhik kathin ho jaataa he or kvathanank bindu ucch ho jaataa he
 This attraction is known as hydrogen bonding
 jal ke anu, ek-duusare ke pariprekshya main lagaataar chalyman rahete hai or hydrogen band lagaataar khandit or judate rahete hai or timescale par yah 200 femtosecond se adhik teji se hota he
 This bond, however, is strong enough to form many of the specific properties of water described in this article, such as the properties that make it an integral part of life
 jal ko ek dhruviya taral ke rup main varnit ja saktaa he jo gaiyr-anupaatik rup se hydronium aayan main thodaa asambaddh hota he ) or ek sambhddha hydroxide aayan )
 For this dissociation, continuous ablation is usually denoted by the Kw sign and its value is 10–14 at 25 ° C, see "water" and "self-ionization of water" for more information

 Common substances contain only excess of ammonia
 yah gun barf bahaav or glacier kii barf ko pighalane se roktaa he
 Before the advent of mechanical refrigeration, the use of ice to prevent food from rotting was common
 jal kaa ghanatv uske taapmaana par nirbhar karata he, lekin yah sambandh raikhik nahin he or monotonic bhi nahin he 
 jab jal ko kamare ke taapmaana se bhi adhik thanda kiya jaataa he, tab vah anya padaarthon kii tarah teji se ghanaa hone lagata he
 But at about 4 ° C, the water reaches its maximum density
 jaise hi use pariveshik paristhitiyon main or adhik thanda kiya jaataa he, to vah fail kar kam saghan ho jaati he
 This unusual negative thermal expansion is attributed to adaptation-based intermolecular interactions and has also been observed in molten silica
 adhikansh padaarthon ke thos avasthaa unke taral avasthaa se adhik ghani hoti he, isliye thos padaarth kaa ek tukdaa taral padaarth main dub jaataa he
 But, in contrast, a piece of normal ice floats in liquid water, because the density of ice is less than liquid water
 thanda hone par, saamaanya barf kaa ghanatv lagbhag 9% kam ho jaataa he
 This is because the cooling of intermolecular waves causes the molecules to form strong hydrogen bonds with their neighbors and to achieve hexagonal packing by cooling of the hexagonal ice IH
 haalanki hydrogen band, taral kii tulana main crystal main chote hote hai, yah loking prabhaav, taral ke nabhikiyan ke paas pahunchane ke saath ausat samanvay sankhya ko kam karata he
 Other substances, which expand when cold, are antimony, bismuth, gallium, germanium, silicon, acetic acid
 keval saadhaaran, hexagonal barf hi taral se kam ghanaa hota he
 Under increasing pressure there are many changes in ice, which are higher in density than liquid water, such as amorphous ice and very high density amorphous ice
 taapmaana me badhat ke saath jal kaa failaav bhi badhata he
 Reaching the highest point, the density of water decreases by 4% from its highest value
 ek maanak dabaav me barf ke pighalane kii seemaa bindu 0 degree celsius hoti he, haalanki, shuddh taral jal ko bina jamaaye us taapmaana se neeche ke taapmaana me bhi behtareen tareeke se sheethal kiya ja saktaa he, yadi taral padaarth ko hilaayaa na jaae
 yah apane samroop nabhikiyan bindu jo lagbhag 231 ke tak ek drav swaroop main hi rah saktaa he
 The melting point of ordinary hexagonal ice falls slightly below high pressure, but when the ice changes to its allotrops, the melting point increases significantly with pressure, which is 2
216 g Pascal at 355 K

 These properties of water have an important role in the Earth's ecosystem
 4 degree celsius ke taapmaana kaa jal, vaataavaran main kisi bhi taapmaana ke baavjood, hameshaa taaje jal kii jhiilon ke tal main jamaa ho jaataa he
 Since water and ice are poor conductors of heat, there is no possibility that the lake deep enough will freeze completely, until it is shaken by powerful currents that will provide cold and hot water and accelerate cooling
 garm mausam main, barf kii chattaane, neeche doobane kii bajaay, jahaan ve bahut dhire-dhire pighalati hai, tairti hai
 These events can thus protect aquatic life
 jal kaa ghanatv, jal main ghule namak or saath hi jal ke taapmaana par nirbhar karata he
 Ice still floats in the oceans, otherwise they will freeze from the bottom up
 However, the amount of salt in the oceans reduces the freezing point by 2 ° c and reduces the temperature of the maximum density of water to freezing point
 yahi kaaran he ki, samudri jal main, pani kaa neeche kii ore sanvahan, pani ke failane se baadhit nahin hota he chunki yah himank ke nazadik thanda ho jaataa he
 The cold water of the oceans goes down near the freezing point
 is kaaran se, koi bhi praani jo arctic mahaasaagar jaise thande pani ke tal main jivit rahane kaa prayaas karata he, saamanytah sardiyon main kisi jhil ke jame hue thande pani se 4 °C se bhi kam ke taapmaana par rahegaa
 As the surface saline water begins to freeze, the ice that forms is essentially salt-free and its density is equal to freshwater
 barf ke behate khand or jamaa hua namak bhi samudri jal kii lavanta or ghanatv ko prabhavit karata he, is prakriya ko brin rijection ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This high-density saline water goes down by convection and the seawater in its place undergoes the same process
 isse sataha par -1
9 degree celsius par anivaary rup se mithe jal kaa barf praapt hota he
 An increase in the density of seawater under frozen ice causes it to sink downward
 ek bade paimaane par, brin rijection kii prakriya or samudr ke thande namakeen jal ko dubaane ke parinamswaroop samudri dharaaen aise pani ko dhruv se dur le jane ke liye taiyaar hoti hai
 One possible consequence of global warming may be that as a result of the destruction of Arctic ice, these currents may also decrease, causing unseen impacts to near and distant climates
 jal kai taral padaarthon jaise athenol ke saath sabhi anupaaton main villeyashil hota he or ekmaatr samaangi taral kaa nirmaan karata he
 On the other hand, water and most oils are insoluble and usually form layers according to the density rising from the top
 ek gas ke rup main, jal vaashp puri tarah se vaayu main villeyashil he
 On the other hand the maximum water vapor pressure, which remains thermodynamically stable with the liquid at a certain temperature, remains relatively low compared to the total atmospheric pressure
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi vaashp kaa aanshik dabaav vayumandaleey dabaav kaa 2% he or hawa ko 22 °C se shuru karte hue 25 °C se thanda kiya jaataa he, to jal ghanaa hona shuru ho jayega or isse os bindu kaa pataa chalegaa or kohre yaa os kaa nirmaan hoga
 Its adverse process eliminates fog in the morning
 yadi gharelu taapmaana par nami ko badhaayaa jaataa he to, maan lijiye ek garm shower ko chalaakar yaa snaan se or taapmaana ek hi rahata he, to vaashp jald hi pravastha ke parivartan ke liye dabaav main pahunchataa he or bhaap ke rup main baahar aata he
 In this context, a gas is called saturated or 100% relative humidity, when the pressure of water vapor in the air is equal to the pressure of water or water vapor, then it comes into contact with saturated air and decreases its amount through evaporation
 Will do
 chunki hawa main bhaap kii maatra kam hoti he, saapekshik ardrata, bhaap ke kaaran aanshik dabaav or santrupt jal vaashp ke aanshik dabaav ke bich kaa anupaat kaaphi upyogi ho jaataa he
 Vapor pressures above 100% relative humidity are called over-saturated and occur when the air cools rapidly, such as with a sudden upward flow

 The low water pressure means that in the 4 km deep sea, where the pressure is 40 mpa, there is only a 1
8% decrease in volume
 vah taapmaana or dabaav jis par taral, thos or gasiy jal saath-saath rahete hai trigun bindu kaha jaataa he
 This point is used to define the unit of temperature
 ek parinaam ke rup main, jal kaa trigun bindu taapmaana, ek maapi gai maatra ke bajaay ek nirdhaarit mulya he
 The temperature of the triple point is unanimously at 273

 Although commonly referred to as the "triple point of water", the stable mixture of liquid water, ice I, and water vapor is one of several triple points on the phase diagram of water
 gautingen main gustav henrik johaan apolon tamman ne kai anya trigun binduon par 20veen sadi ke purvardh main data kaa utpaadan kiya
 Kamb and others documented further triple points in the 1960s
 bina aayan kaa shuddh jal, ek utkrisht visanvahak he, lekin "diynikrut" jal bhi puri tarah se aayan mukt nahin he
 Self-ionization of water takes place in a liquid state 
 iske alaava, chunki jal itnaa acha vilaayak he ki isamen lagbhag hameshaa kuch ghulaa hua padaarth mila hota he, aksar yah namak hota he
 If there is even such a small amount of impurity in the water, it will conduct electricity well, because impurities such as salt dissociate into a free solution, in an aqueous solution, from which current can flow
 ye gyaat he ki, jal ke liye adhiktam vidyut pratirohakata 25 °C par lagbhag 182 kω·m he
 This figure is very similar to that found on reverse osmosis, where ultra filtered and deionized ultra pure water is used, for example, in a semiconductor manufacturing factory
 a salt or acid pollutant, whose level in extremely pure water is trilion at 100 parts, begins to reduce its resistivity level by several kilo-meters

 Any electrical conductivity of water is the result of ions of mineral salts dissolved in water and carbon dioxide
 carbon dioxide, jal main carbonate yanon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Water is self-ionized, forming two molecules of water, a hydroxide ion and a hydronium cation, but not enough so that most of the operations can conduct any work or harmful current
 shuddh jal main, samvedansheel upkaran, 25 °C par 0
055 μs / cm ke maamuli vidyut chaalakata kaa pataa laga saktaa he
 Water can be electrolyzed into oxygen and hydrogen gases, but in the absence of dissolved ions, this process is very slow, as very little current is driven
 jabaki jal main electron, charge ke praathmik vaahak hai, barf main praathmik vaahak proton hai 
 Through the flow of an electric current into water, water can be divided into its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen
 is prakriya ko vidyut apghaton kaha jaataa he
 Water molecules naturally dissociate into h + and oh-ions, which are attracted towards the cathode and anode, respectively
 cathod par, do H+ aayan, electronon ko lete hai or H2 gas kaa nirmaan karte hai
 At the anode, four oh-ions are combined and release O2 gas, molecular water, and four electrons

 The standard capacity of a hydroelectric decomposition cell is 1
23 v at 25 ° C
 jal kaa ek mahatvapurn gun uski dhruviya prakruti he
 Water molecules form an angle with hydrogen atoms at their corners and oxygen at the top
 Since oxygen has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen, the molecule of the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge in the cells
 aisi charge bhinnata vaali kisi vastu ko dypole kehete hai
 Charge differences cause water molecules to be attracted to each other and to other polar molecules
 This attraction contributes to hydrogen bonding and explains many properties of water, such as solvent
 The two-polar nature of water can be demonstrated by holding an object with an electric current near a small current, whereby the water current is attracted to the charged object
 jal kaa ek anu adhiktam chaar hydrogen band bana saktaa he kyonki yah do hydrogen parmaanuon ko de saktaa he or le saktaa he
 Other molecules such as hydrogen fluoride, methanol, and ammonia also form hydrogen bonds but do not exhibit asymmetric behavior of thermodynamic, kinetic or structural properties as seen in water

 The local tetrahedral sequence generated due to four hydrogen bonds in water gives rise to an open structure and a 3 dimensional bonding network, which results in an odd decrease in density when cooled below 4 ° C
 haalanki, jal ke anu ke bheetar kovalent band kii tulana main hydrogen bonding ek apekshaakrit kamjor aakarshan he, yah jal ke kai bhautik gunon ke liye jimmedaar he
 One such property is the relatively high melting point and boiling point of water; More energy is required to break hydrogen bonds between molecules
 isi tarah mishrit hydrogen sulphide, jisamen bahut kamjor hydrogen bonding he, vah ek gharelu taapmaana gas he, haalanki isamen jal kii aanvik raashi kaa doguna hota he
 The additional bonding between water molecules gives liquid water a larger specific heat capacity

 Water clings to each other because it is polar
 apni dhruviya prakruti ke kaaran jal main ucch aasanjan gun hota he
 Water can form a thin layer on very clean / smooth glass because the molecular force between water and glass molecules is stronger than the cohesive force
 jaivik koshikaon or organel main, jal kaa sampark jhilli or protein satahon se hota he jo hydrophylic hote hai; yani ki, ve satahen jinka jal ke saath ek majboot aakarshan he
 Irving Lengmuir found a powerful repulsive force between the hydrophilic surfaces
 hydrophylic satahon ko dihidrate karne ke liye - jal ke hidration ke balon, bulaayaa takaton ke khilaaf kaam karne kii aavashyaktaa he, jise dihidration kehete hai
 These forces are very large, but decrease rapidly within a nanometer or less

 Water has a high surface tension of 72
8 mn / m at domestic temperature, which is due to the strong cohesion between water molecules and is the highest among nonmetallic liquids
 dekha ja saktaa he jab pani kii thodi si maatra ko shoshan mukt sataha par daalaa jaae, jaise ki polithilin yaa tefflon or jal, boond ke rup main ek saath bana rahata he
 Importantly the air trapped in the water surface creates bubbles, which sometimes stay for a long time and transfer to gas molecules
 ek or satahi tanaav keshika lahar he, jo sataha par jal kii buundon ke asar ke aasapaas banaate hai or kabhi-kabhi majboot dhaaraon ke rup main sataha par behate hai
 Resistance due to surface tension gives rise to capillary wave
 aasanjan or satahi tanaav ke paraspar balon ke kaaran, jal keshika kriya pradarshit karata he jiske tahat gurutvkarshan bal ke khilaaf, jal ek sankeern tub main upar uthta he
 Water is attached to the inner wall of the tube and the surface tension lifts it up keeping the surface straight and more water is drawn up through the modifier
 yah prakriya jari rahati he jab tak ki jal tub main bahata rahata he or phir baad main gurutvkarshan bal aasanjak baalo ko santulit karata he
 Surface tension and capillary function are important in biology
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab jilam ke madhyam se jal ko paudhon main upar le jaaya jaataa he, to majboot antar-aanvik aakarshan jal ke bhaagon ko ek saath pakade rahata he or aasanjan gun, jilam se jal kaa sambandh banaae rakhata he or swead khinchaav dwaara hone vaale tanaav tuutan ko roktaa he
 Water is also a good solvent due to its polarity
 jo padaarth jal main acchhee tarah mil jate hai or ghul jate hai unhen hydrophylic ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jo nahin ghulte hai unhen hydrophobic ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The ability of a substance to dissolve in water is determined by whether the substance meets the water generated molecules or is superior to them
 yadi kisi padaarth ke gun majboot antar-aanvik balon par kaabo paane kii anumati nahin dete hai, anuon ko jal se "baahar dhakka de diya" jaataa he or ve ghulte nahin hai
 Contrary to popular belief, water and hydrophobic materials do not produce "distraction" and the hydration of a hydrophobic surface is powerfully favorable
 jab ek ynic yaa dhruviya yogic, jal main pravesh karata he, to yah jal ke anuon dwaara ghira hota he
 Molecules of relatively small size of water usually allow several water molecules to coalesce around a molecule of solute
 jal ke, aanshik rup se nakaaratmak dypole chor, viley ke sakaaratmak charge vaale ghatakon kii ore aakarshith hote hai or iskaa thik ulataa sakaaratmak dypole ke chhoron par lagu hota he
 In general, ionic and polar substances such as acids, alcohols, and salts are relatively soluble in water and non-polar substances such as fats and oils are not
 gaiyr dhruviya anu, jal main ek saath isliye rahete hai kyonki jal ke anuon ke liye yah adhik anukool he ki ve ek duusare se hydrogen boond karen, bajaay iske ki gaiyr-dhruviya anuon ke saath ve vine der wal sampark main sanlagn hon
 An example of an ionic solute is table salt; Sodium chloride, nacl, which dissociates into Na + cation and Cl - ions, each of which is surrounded by a water molecule
 yanon ko phir aasaani se unke sphatik latis se dur le jaaya jaataa he
 Common sugar is an example of a non-ionic solute
 jal ke dipol, chini ke anu ke dhruviya kshetron ke saath hydrogen band banaate hai or ise ghol main jane kii anumati dete hai
 Chemically, water is amphoteric: it can act as either a base or an acid in chemical reactions
 bronsted-lori paribhaasha ke anusaar, ek acid ko ek aisi prajati ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he jo ek abhikriya main ek proton kaa daan karata he or ek base kaa jo proton letaa he
 When reacting with a strong acid, water acts as a base; It reacts as an acid when a reaction occurs with a strong base
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab hydrochloric acid banataa he to jal ek H+ aayan HCL se praapt karata he: In reaction with ammonia, NH3 gives water an h + ion and thus acts as an acid: chunki jal ke oxigen parmaanu main do akeli jodi hoti he, jal aksar, ek louis acid ke saath pratikriyaaon main ek louis base yaa electron jodi daata ke rup main kaary karata he, haalanki yah louis base ke saath bhi pratikriya kar saktaa he or electron jodi daata or jal ke hydrogen parmaanuon ke bich hydrogen band bana saktaa he
 The HSAB principle describes water as a weak hard acid and a weak hard base, which means that it reacts with other hard species at will: jab ek kamjor base yaa ek kamjor acid kaa namak jal main ghulata he, to jal aanshik rup se namak ko hydrolies kar saktaa he, jo sabun ke jalkrut mishran or baking soda ko unka mul ph detaa he: The Lewis base of water makes it a common ligand in transition, examples of which are solvent ions, such as Fe63 +, as well as perhanic acid and various solid hydrates, such as cocl2 · 6H2O
 Water, generally a monodent ligand, forms only a single bond with the central atom

 Other systematic names for water include hydroxy acid, hydroxylic acid, and hydrogen hydroxide
 For water, both acid and alkali exist because it is amphoteric
 Although these names are not technically incorrect, none of them are widely used

 In Sanskrit, the system of commentary, interpretation and commentary holds special significance

 The reason for this is that in many commentaries, more things than the original, novel interpretation and refutation have been established by new ideas
 koshgranthon ke tikaakaron kaa krititv bhi bade mahatv kaa he
 While on one hand there are new words, new meanings and new interpretations, on the other hand the names of many lexicons and lexicons are also found

 Therefore, we should never forget their importance and contribution in the history of Sanskrit dictionaries
 aadhunik or paashchaatya koshon kii bhedakataayen mukhyatah nimnanirdisht ho sakati hai- In Europe, and partly in India - in the primitive period, difficult words were interpreted by simple words or expressions
 yorape main saamanytah ek paryaay de diya jaataa tha or bharat main vaidic nighantukaal se hi paryaayashabdon kaa arthbodhakparak ekatrikaran hota tha
 These were the main inspiration for the collection of imprecise and difficult words
 bhartiya koshon main bahuparyaay sangrah ke kaaran anek clisht shabdon ke saath paryaayavachi koshon main saral shabd bhi samavisht rahete the
 Nighantu's vocabulary is influenced by the compilation of mostly imprecise and thoughtful words rather than a collection of comprehensive vocabulary of Vedic poetry
 bharat ke pracheen kosh paryaayavachi yaa samanarthak the
 In the initial state, appendages were attached to these words
 aage chalakar nanarthak yaa anekarth shabdalipi kaa vistaar se akalan hone laga
 As a result, in many non-sanskrit lexicons of Sanskrit, there was mainly nomenclature and later on started becoming lignard
 paryaayavachi koshon kii sangrayojna vargparak ho gai thi
 The sequence of endings was adopted in the sequence scheme of non-word words
 par kabhi kabhai adivarna kaa aadhaar lekar varnmalansri shabd-kramyojna kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 On the other hand, modern dictionaries give additional synonyms of minor dictionaries as well as semantic interpretations
 sanskrit main yah nahin tha
 Commentaries certainly did this work
 sanskrit ke samanarthak koshon kii bhanti aadhunik koshon main paryaay rakhane par aadhik bal dene cheshtaa nahin hoti
 Sometimes, due to the influence of Sanskrit lexicons, in Hindi, etc
, they also become eponymous dictionaries
 par vastut: ye kosh sanskrit koshon ke anvasheshmaatr he, aadhunik kosh nahin
 In the ancient lexicons of Sanskrit, there was mainly a collection of nampadas, avyābhābhā तथाas and kabhai at times
 vyakaran- prabhavit sangrahadrushti kaa mul kadachit panini ke dhatupath or ganapaathon main dikhaai padataa he
 Initially, Amarakala and thereafter, the main form of Sanskrit became Namaligāासaनात्मकāsika
 aadhunik koshon main rachanavidhan kii bhinnata ke kaaran ise anupayogi maanakar sarvatha tyaag diya gaya
 But useful instructions for grammatical knowledge and experimentation are assigned by each with a small number of symbols
 aaj ke shabdkoshon kaa nirmaan un samast janon ke liye hota he jo tattadbhashaon ke saral yaa kathin kisi bhi shabd kaa arth jaananaa chaahate he
 The main form of Sanskrit lexicon was poetic
 is kaaran uskaa adhikt: upyog ve hi kar pate the jo koshapadyon ko kanthsy kar rakhte the
 Along with experimentation and semantics, memorizing shells was also considered a purpose, but today's new dictionaries have no purpose at all
 sanskrit ke pracheen koshon kaa prayojan hota tha kaviyon, sahityanirmataaon or kavyashastradi ke pathakon ke shabdabhandar kii vruddhi karnaa
 But the main purpose of modern lexicons is to increase the power of their expedient usage by giving knowledge of the meaning of words and giving information about the related things
 inek atiritk shabdoccharan, vyutpattisuchan, shabdaprayog kaa pratham or yadi koi shabd luptprayog ho gaya ho to uskaa sapramaan aitihaasik varnan, naanaa artho kaa samaanya aban vishesh sandarbh- sanyutak vivitk vivaran, yogic evam muhaavaron ke shabdayogon tathaa dhaatuyogon aadi ke arthvaishishty kaa sodaaharan nirupan bhi aadhunik koshon main rahata he

 O
 Henry or William Sidney Porter was a famous American writer
 unka janm 11 sitambar, 1862 ke din greensbaro, uttar kerolina main hua or mratyu 5 june, 1910 ko new yark main
 In previous years, he used to write his middle name as 'sydney'
 solah varsh kii umr main unhone skool chhod diya, par unki padhane-likhane kii aturata nahin chhuti
 As a child, he worked in a drugstore in Greensboro, where his birth anniversary is still celebrated
 unniis varsh kii avasthaa main vah apana swasthya sudhaarney ke liye texas pradesh ke gocharon main rahane chalaa gaya
 There he learned horse riding and also subdued wild, stubborn horses
 fir austin main use ek kheti-baadi ke daphtar main naukari mil gayi
 All the things of his pictorial life around which he was introduced, all of them were captured in his stories
 yahi kaaran he ki uski kahaniyaan adhiktar charaagahon ke pradesh, madhya america yaa neuyark main ghatit hoti he
 The urban life stories for which he is famous are an acknowledgment of the irony of life
 ve unke apane katu anubhavon ke pratibimb hai
 In his fifteen-year-old Texas stay in which he married and became the father of a daughter, regretful subtractions covered his hopes
 unhe kisi bank main note ginaney kaa kaam mil gaya, lekin kuch hi dinon main uske hisaab main kuch hajaarek dollars kii gadabad kaa pataa chalane par, vah naukari bhi chhot gai
 It seems that his boss did not want to punish him, so he continued to work in a newspaper in the city of Houston for almost a year, without stopping
 tab, shaayad giraftaari se bachane ke liye vah new orlians chale gaye, jahaan se unhone tojilo or honduras kaa tikat kataa liya
 Described in his first book titled 'cabbage and Kings', the place of all the stories of courage and adventure is found here
 apni patni kii beemaari ne unhe vaapis austin bula liya
 She died as soon as they returned
 tab khyanat ke aparaadh main unpar mukadmaa chalaa or sajaa ho gayi
 William Porter, jailed for three years and three months
 vah apni sajaa ko utsaahpurvak jhelane vaala ek sadaachari kaidi the
 But the black shadow of this period was always visible on his life
 yaheen se unamem garibon ke prati dayaa bhav utpann hua or yahi se uski kai shreshth kahaniyon kaa janm hua, jinamein se 'hryday parivartan' naamak kahani ke aadhaar par khelaa gaya 'urf jimmy balantin' naamak naatak, us samay kaa sarvshereshth naatak siddh hua
 His surname has been discovered by a captain of the prison's soldiers named Henry
 porter ne sochaa ki hastakshar karne ke liye 'o0 henry' hi kaafii he
 When he started writing, he also requested the editors to keep his name a secret
 neuyark main o0 henry, medisson chowk or irving plas ke muhallon ke kamaron main rahete or apni kahaniyon se paisa kama-kama kar kiraaya chukaane ke liye bheeshan sangharsh karte rahete
 Friends, Robert H
 Davis, Bartlett Maris, Irwin S
 Kaab, and many other writers and editors have described their rooms
 ve ek baahar vaale kamare main rahata the
 Whose windows were spread to the floor
 yahaan baithkar vah rahgeeron kii ore ghoorte rahete or unke ird-gird jeevat ke jaal bunate rahete
 He began to make optimistic, monogamous individuals eligible for their stories
 un ladakiyon kii kalpana kii, jo dhandha or pyaar paane ke liye, shaharon main bhatakane aati hai; ve yuvak, jo dusron se adhik laabh khojate hai or ve sharaabi tathaa ayogy aadmi, jo durbhaagya ko bhi ahankaar se jhelte hai tathaa kabhi-kabhi kahaniyon ke paatro kii tarah bhavukta pradarshit karte hai, uske kathanayake bane
 If the plot was unhappy, O
 Henry would have added salt and pepper to the local dialects
 uske liye koi ghatana itani neeras nahin thi ki jisamen vah chamak na paidaa kar sake
 Arriving at the same place, he invented that extreme point or turn, which led to the end of many of his stories becoming unpredictable
 "sajaa hua cameraa,""chat par kaa cameraa" or "vaasanthi menu" jaisi choti kahaniyon main to yah spasht he hi, kuch badi kahaniyon main bhi is tatv ke darshan hote hai
 In the American audience, since the era of sitting around the fire of old times and listening to stories, there has been a special affection for this type of anecdote
 o0 henry kii kahaniyaan inhen paramparaagat kathaon kii vistrat pratikratiyaan maaloom detii he
 He was a magician in the plot and he was a master at creating such hypothetical situations, where his characters seem to be playing with him rather than living
 pathako kaa manoranjan karnaa uskaa dhyey tha or unki kautuhalavratti ko jagaate rakhane ke liye, unhone apanepatro se tarah-tarah ke tamaashe karawaaye hai
 They are depicted as hungry for romance, boldly combating bad times, pretending nobility and wandering in the colorful world of modern 'alif-laila'
 manushya kaa sarvasparshi or sagopang vishleshan unhone shaayad hi kahin kiya ho
 He saw the human being, stranded in the vortex of modern urban life, as a helpless person
 'sneh deep' kahani kii nansi ko sirf ek dukaan main kaam karne ke kaaran, ek dukandaar ladki maanane se vah inkaar kar detaa he or kahata he," ansi koi kism nahin hoti
 Today's corrupt society has become used to finding variety
 " usne manushya ko itnaa gira hua shaayad hichitrit kiya ho ki vah apni kamajoriyon ke liye sharminda bhi na ho
 Beneath all his stories is an undercurrent of kindness and sympathy
 jeevanamen bhuule-bhatke yaa pichde hue har badanaseeb ko vah manushyata ke vyapak kutumb main sthaan dene ko sadaa tatpar rahaa
 Sometimes they entertain him, sometimes make him sad with the irony of his life and sometimes he gets emotional, but in any case, he accepts every manipulation of fate and his villains are also ridiculous
 - Not evil
 o0 henry kii kala, uski duusari kitaab 'da for million' main nikhar uthi, jisase use kaafii lokapriyata bhi mili
 Forty years after it was first published, the story of his 'gift' was made into a movie
 uski anya kahaniyon ke kai sankalan prakashit hue jaise 'sneh deep', 'pashchim kii aatma', 'shahar kii aawaaj' ,'bhagyachakr' ,'vikalp' ,'dhandhe kii baat' ,' jivan chakra' 
 After his death, three books were published - 'white-collar thugs', 'awara' and 'bhule-bhate'
