 From the very beginning in organic chemistry, the method in which two or more molecules of a compound substance combine to form a second molecule or polymer whose percentage organization is the same as that of the original substance was monosyllabic, and its atomic mass is a multiple of the monomer
 
 anek dwibandh yaa tribandhwaale carbonic yogic main garam karne yaa keval rakhane par hi yogashil bahulkikaran ho jaataa he
 By this process the original volatiles can be converted into less volatile liquids or solids

 Keep for a few days or 100 degrees centigrade
 By heating, it polymerizes
 pehle ek gadha drav praapt hota he or ant main ek svachh gandhhin, chamakdaar, thos padaarth praapt ho jaataa he, jise polistyrine kehete hai
 This can be represented by the formula, where n is in thousands
 kuch aise padaarth haate hai jinaki upasthiti main bahulkikaran kriya keval kuch minuton main hi sampann ho jaati he
 Such substances are called initiators
 is prakaar styrine ke bahulkikaran main ek pratishat se bhi kam maatra main benjyayal paroxide mila dene se kuch minuton ke andar hi polistyrine praapt ho saktaa he
 Such reactions are carried out by chain reactions and the free radicals, which are formed by dissolution of the initiator, complete the action
 is prakaar yadi prarambhk ke vighatan se mukt mulak bane, to vah dwibandh se yoga karke ek bada anu banaata he, jisamen bhi swatantra bandha hote hai
 This action then proceeds and the size of the molecule increases progressively
 yadi do ekalakon kaa bahulkikaran ek saath mila kar kiya jaae, to bahulak ke prayek anu main donon ekalak bhi upasthit ho sakate hai
 The polymer obtained in this way is called co-aggregator

 Dardi languages are spoken in northern Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
 sari dardi bhashaaon main kashmiri kaa hi rutaba sabase unchaa he kyonki iskaa apana prachlit sahitya he or ise bharat kii ek aadhikarik bhashaa hone kaa maan bhi praapt he
 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' in Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' it becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he

 But perhaps few people would know that in ancient times India was a very developed country at the level of economy and business
 yah baat aitihaasik saakshyon, khudaai se praapt pramaanon, sahitya va likhit dastavezon se sidhi hoti hai
 Attracted by the immense wealth of India, most of these attacks from time to time by various foreign invaders also prove this fact
 pracheen bhartiya sabhyataa na keval vrufashi aadhaarit thi, balki iske aantarik va bahya vyapaar va vaanijya bhi kaaphi unnat the
 India has immense contribution in various fields of business
 us samay ke anya deshon main prachlit vyavsaayon se tulana karne par ham pate hai ki bhartiya vyavsaay apni vilakshantaa, gatishiltaa ;gatyaatmakataaddh va gunatmakataa main in sabase kahin aage tha
 In the early days, the Indian economy was completely agricultural based
 log apane upbhog kii vastuon kaa utpaadan swayan karte the
 There was no need to sell or exchange goods
 lekin vikaas ke saath-saath logon kii aavashyaktaayen badhane lagi
 Due to which production of goods also increased
 logon ne dainik upyog tathaa vilasita sambandhi vibhinn vastuon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata arjeet kerani shuru kar di or is tarah se unke paas apane upyog kii anya vastuon ke utpaadan ke liye dakshataor samay kaa vyavsaay kii prakruti tathaa kshetra abhaav hona shuru ho gaya
 In this way, their efficiency increased and they were able to produce more items than they needed
 atah apni anya aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye apni adhki utpaadit vastuon ke vinimay kii pranali viksit ho gai
 This was the beginning of trade
 aaj zyaadaatar log yah maanate hai ki bharat main vyavsaay va vyapaar ke kshetra main itnaa vikaas swatantrata prapti ke pashchaat hi hua he
 India has become so capable in industrial production today that we can produce all goods using indigenous technology
 lekin isse yah parinaam nahin nikaal lenaa chahie ki bhoot kaal main bhartiya sabhyataa viksit yaa unnat nahin thi
 While we are still proud of India's rich commercial and commercial heritage
 aap yah jaanakar hairaan honge ki bharat ne vyapaar va vaanijya ke kshetra main apni yatra 5000 varsh i
pus
 shuru kar di thi
 It is proved from many historical evidences that at that time there were well planned cities in India
 bhartiya kapadon, aabhushanon or itra ityadi ke prati puure vishwa main aakarshan tha
 There has also been evidence that for a long time there was a trend among Indian traders to use currency for business
 vyapaariyon, shilpakaaron va utpaadakon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye sanghon ;hanpaskaddh kaa prachlan tha
 This indicates the complex development of trade and commerce in India
 us samay bharat ke vyapaariyon ne na keval sudrudh aantarik vyavsaayik raaston kaa jaal buna tha, balki unke vyavsaayik sambandh arab, madhya va dakshin purv asia ke vyapaariyon se bhi the
 India was also active in the production of various types of metal materials such as copper, brass articles, utensils, jewelry and decorative items etc
 bhartiya vyapaaree vishwa ke vibhinn bhaagon main apane utpaadon kaa niryaat karte the or vahaan se unke utpaadon kaa aayaat karte the
 It is a well-known fact that the British first came to India to do business, who later established their kingdom here
 bharat ne kai prakaar se vishwa vyapaar va vaanijya main yogadan diya he
 The numeral system for calculation, which we still use today, was already developed in India

 All business actions are performed to serve certain purposes
 vyavsaay ke uddeshyon ko nimna prakaar vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he : The economic objectives of the business include all the necessary actions that serve the purpose of making profit, such as creating customers, regular innovation and better utilization of available resources, with the objective of making a profit
 laabh, vyavsaay ke liye jivan daayini shakti kaa kaary karata he
 Without this, no business can survive in the competition market
 vastav main kisi bhi vyavsaayik ikai ke astitv main aane kaa uddeshy hota he- laabh kamanaa
 Profit not only helps the businessman in earning his livelihood, but also helps in expansion of business activities by re-appropriating a part of the profit in the business
 laabh kamaane ke praathmik uddeshy ko praapt karne ke liye vyavsaay ke kuch anya uddeshy nimnlikhit hai : Social objectives are the objectives of business which are necessary to be achieved for the interests of society
 atah har vyavsaay kaa uddeshy hona chahie ki vah kisi bhi prakaar se samaaj ko haani na pahunchaae
 The social objectives of business include production and fulfillment of good quality goods and services, adoption of proper business practices, contribution to the general welfare functions of the society and contribution to welfare facilities
 maanviya uddeshyon se abhipraay un uddeshyon se he, jinamein samaaj ke aksham tathaa viklang, shiksha athwa prashikshan se vanchit logon ke kalyaan tathaa karmchaariyon kii apekshaaon kii purti ke lakshya nihit hote hai
 Thus, the humanitarian objectives of business include economic security of employees, social and psychological satisfaction and development of human resources
 vyavsaay, desh kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he atah rashtriya lakshyon or aakankshaon kii prapti prayek vyavsaay kaa uddeshy hona chahie
 The national objectives of the business are: pehle bharat ke anya deshon ke saath bahut hi simit vyapaarik sambandh the
 The policies regarding import and export of goods were very stringent then, but nowadays liberal economic policies have largely eliminated the ban on foreign investment, and the duty on imported goods has also come down considerably
 in parivartanon se bazaar main pratiyogita kaaphi bad gai he
 Today, the whole world has transformed into a big market due to globalization
 aaj ek desh main taiyaar maal duusare desh main aasaani se uplabdh he
 Thus, due to increasing competition in the world market, every business has started working with some purpose in its mind, which can be called a global objective
 log laabh arjeet karne ke uddeshy se vyavsaay chalaate hai
 But making profit alone is not the sole purpose of business
 samaaj kaa ek ang hone ke naate ise bahut se saamaajik kaary bhi karne hote hai
 It also bears the responsibility of looking after the nature and area and community of business, especially the owners, investors, employees and society in general in protecting their existence
 atah prayek vyavsaay ko kisi na kisi rup main inke prati jimmedaariyon kaa nirvaah karnaa chahie
 For example, assuring investors a reasonable rate of return, providing good salaries, security, proper working conditions to their employees, providing good quality goods to their customers at reasonable prices, protecting the environment and so on
 Many tasks should be done
 haalanki aise kaary karte samay vyavsaay ke saamaajik uttardayitvon ke nirvaah ke liye do baton kaa vishesh rup se dhyaan rakhana chahie
 First of all, not every such action is a ritualistic action
 iskaa arth yah he ki yadi koi vyavsaay kisi aspataal athwa mandir yaa kisi skool athwa college ko kuch dhanrashi daan main detaa he to yah uskaa saamaajik uttardaayitv nahin kehalaayegaa, kyonki daan dene se saamaajik uttardayitvon kaa nirvaah nahin hota
 Secondly, such actions should not be good for some people and bad for some people
 maan lijie ek vyapaaree taskari karke yaa apane graahakon ko dhekha dekar bahut sa dhan arjeet kar letaa he or garibon ke mufrat ilaaj ke liye aspataal chalaata he to uskaa yah kaary saamaajik rup se nyyochit nahin he
 Social responsibility means that a businessman should not do anything which is harmful to society while performing social activities
 is prakaar saamaajik uttardaayitv kii avadharna vyavsaayee ko jamkhori va kalabazari, kar chori, milawat, graahakon ko dhekha dena jaisi anuchit vyaparik kriyaaon ke badale vyavsaayee ko vivekpurna prabandhn ke dwaara laabh arjeet karne ke liye protsaahit karti he
 This is possible by providing appropriate work and residential facilities to the employees, providing appropriate after-sales services to the customers, controlling environmental pollution and protecting natural resources
 vyavsaay ke saamaajik uttardaayitv kii avadharna tathaa iske mahatv ke bare main jaankaree praapt kar lene ke baad aaie jaane ki vyavsaay kaa iske vibhinn hit-samoohon, jin par yah ashrith he, ke prati kya uttardaayitv hai
 Business is often dependent on owners, disinvesters, employees, suppliers, customers and consumers, competitors, government and society
 inhen hit-samooh isliye kaha jaataa he, kyonki vyavsaay kii prayek kriya se in samoohon kaa hit, pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se prabhavit hota he
 Responsibilities of business owners: vyavsaay ke apane lendaaron ke prati uttardaayitv haih The business has the following responsibilities towards its employees: vyavsaay ke apane aapurtikarttaaon ke prati uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : Following are the responsibilities of the business towards the customers: vyavsaay ke apane pratiyogiyon ke prati nimnlikhit uttardaayitv hai : The following are the various business responsibilities of the government: ek samaaj, vyaktiyon, samoohon, sanghathanon, pariwaron aadi se milakar banataa he
 They are all members of society
 ye sabhi ek duusare ke saath milte-julate hai tathaa apni lagbhag sabhi gatividhiyon ke liye ek duusare par nirbhar hote hai
 There is a connection between all of them, whether direct or indirect
 samaaj kaa ek ang hone ke naate, samaaj ke sadasyon ke bich sambandh banaae rakhane main vyavsaay ko bhi madad kerani chahie
 For this, it is necessary to discharge certain responsibilities towards the society

 These minerals are also found in metamorphic shells, but not all of them are formed by the process of metamorphism
 All these minerals are formed in the igneous rocks during the crystallization process, and all the minerals have no effect on the process of metamorphism
 The process of metamorphism Due to which there is a change in the mineral, it is called a crystallization

 The texture is divided into elongated and non-elongated categories
 Spongy rocks are the result of differential stresses that cause the rocks to fall into the surface and sometimes crack in the rocks
 For example, slate is a spongy metamorphic rock, produced from a type of shale
 Non-spongy
 Shells do not have a planar pattern

 Web feed) is a data format used to provide users with continuously updated content
 data saamagree pradaata sindicket ke madhyam se web fid uplabdh karavaate hai jinhen prayogkarta sabsakrib kar sakate hai
 Making a web feed available from a location is called aggregation and is done by an aggregator
 web fid ko kabhi kabhi sindicated fid bhi kaha jaataa he
 a typical scenario of using web feeds is that a content provider places feed links on its site that users can access with the aggregator program; Doing this is as simple as dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator
 nirdesh dene par, agrigater apni fid kii suchi main sabhi sarvaron se poochta he ki kya unke paas koi nai saamagree he, yadi haa, to yaa to agrigater nai saamagree kaa ek note bana detaa he yaa use downlod kar detaa he
 The aggregator can be timed to check for new content
 web fid pul technology kaa udhaaharan he, haalanki ve prayogkartaaon ko saamagree push karte hue prathit hote hai
 The content provided by web feeds are exclusively HTML or they may be links to web pages or other forms of digital media
 aamtaur se jab websiten prayogkartaaon ko saamagree parivartan ke sanket kii web fid uplabdh karwaati hai, tab ve sampoorn samagree ke sthaan par sirf uskaa saransh hi dikhaati hai
 Many web sites, web blogs, schools and podcasters provide web feeds
 email ke madhyam se nirantar parivartansheel saamagree ko uplabdh karaane kii tulana main web fid ke kuch laabh hai: The use of a web feed requires a feed reader
 yah saadhan ek swachaalit email program kii tarah kaam karata he, lekin isamen kisi email pate kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 The user subscribes to a particular web feed and then receives the converted content each time
 fid reader online yaa ofline ho saktaa he
 Recently mobile phone usable readers have also come on the market
 ek ofline web fid ko prayogkarta ke computer par downlod kiya jaataa he
 Feed readers are also used to post news on personalized home pages, such as igoogle, My Yahoo, and My MSN, including weather, capital market prices, etc
 vyaktigat prishthon par anya citon se saamagree laane ke liye bhi fid kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Organizations can use the web feed server behind the firewall to share, organize and locate internal and external web feeds between users and user groups
 kuch anya web aadhaarit saadhan fid reeding ke liye hi hote hai
 Initial readers were desktop-based, some of which are still popular, especially among individuals who read a large number of feeds
 udhaaharan ke taur par feeddeman, netnuswair, blogabrij tathaa aresasaul 
 outluk 2007 tathaa thanderbard jaise kuch anya email clyant bhi fid ko sanchalit kar lete hai
 Opera, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer 7
0 and many other browsers incorporate feeds into browsers using live bookmarks, favorites and many other technologies
 aamtaur par ek web fid ko uske srujak dwaara hi uplabdh karavaaya jaataa he
 Usually the feed and the website come from the same place
 tathaapi sabhi websites fid uplabdh nahin karaate
 kabhi kabhi teesraa paksh website pard kar scraping dwaara uski fid uplabdh karvaa saktaa he
 Scrapping is controversial because it distributes it in a manner not chosen by the owner of the content
 web fid ek document he jiske asanyojit bhaag main saamagree ke strot kaa web link hota he
 Although news web sites and blogs are common sources of web feeds, feeds are used for the distribution of any structured information, which can range from weather to top ten song listings and search results
 web fid ke do mukhya swaroop hai: aar es es or atom
 The two main terms that describe how feeds are made available for information are "publication of feeds" and "syndication"
 sindicket kii gayi web fid saamagree prakashit samachar patr kii tarah hi anya web citon dwaara saajha evam punarprakashit kii ja sakati he
 The popular definition of is really simple syndication)
 fid ko prayogkartaaon dwaara sidhe hi agrigaters yaa fid readers ke dwaara sabsakrib kiya jaataa he jo kai web fid ko ek screen athwa screenon kii shrinkhalaa par dikhaati he
 Some modern web browsers include an aggregator feature
 prayogkarta saadharantaya fid sabsakrib karne ke liye haath se URL daalate hai athwa brouzar main link par clic karte hai
 Web feeds are not readable by humans, but are readable by machines, which is why people are initially confused with web feeds
 iskaa matlab yah he ki web fid kaa prayog swachaalit rup se kisi bhi maanviya hastkshep ke bina ek website kii jaankaree duusari main sthanantarit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The term RSS is commonly used to denote web feed or web syndication, although not all web feed formats are RSS
 udhaaharan ke taur par agrigator main web fid kaa upyog karne kaa bloguspes ke varnan main mukhya rup se "aar es es info" tathaa "aar es es readers" shabd aate hai, haalanki pratham pankti main atom praaroop ko shaamil karne se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki "aar es es tathaa atom fil aapke computer ke liye kisi web sait se samachar uplabdh karaate hai"
 Template: Podcasting dandadayitv is shabd kaa saadhaaran arth he - kiye gaye "aparaadh" ke liye dand paane kaa daayitv
 a person who commits a crime is usually called a criminal, ie one who commits an illegal act by law or disregards the compulsory work prescribed by the law and causes harm to society by his work or its disregard

 Due to this, cases of criminal prosecution are brought against the criminals from the state itself and the person interviewed with the crime remains only a witness or an instrument
 samaaj kaa pratik vah vyakti mana jaataa he, jisamen saarvbhaum satta virajman ho
 Such ruling persons have different names in different countries
 yatha, england main raja, bharat main raashtrapati
 In the case of conviction, these are the names of the first party, although the Attorney General or Director of Public Prosecution may also be on the first side from the government
 dandabhiyog evam swatvadhikaar ke maamalon main yah moulik antar he ki dandabhiyog kaa lakshya hota he doshi ko dand dilaanaa, swatvadhikar ke maamle main vaadi kaa uddeshy hota he sampatti praapt karnaa yaa kisi vyaktigat adhikaar kii ghoshnaa karana
 Punishments may be given in different forms for conviction
 yatha, mrityu, aaajeevan nirvaasan, karawas, virodh, kode maarna, arthdand, apradhi kii sampatti kaa rajasatkaran ityadi
 Sometimes, along with the punishment, the offender has to suffer the detriment of civil rights and kidnapping of political rights
 koi kisi aparaadh ke liye dandit nahin ho saktaa, yadi usne pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup main kanoon dwaara amaanya koi kaam na kiya ho yaa kanoon dwaara nirdhaarit kisi anivaary kaam main truti nahin kii ho
 Generally, for the completion of a crime, it is necessary to do it with a defective mind
 kintu apradhi kii swechha se hone par hi uskaa kaam aparaadh mana ja saktaa he
 Voluntary work or disregard of work is that which is desired to be done or not done
 at: kisi vyakti ne yadi achetan avasthaa main-yatha, nidrit hone par, atyant kam avasthaa rahane se, jadta yaa veikshiptata ke kaaran koi aparaadh kiya he to yah mana jaayga ki aisi paristhiti main uskaa mastishk kaam nahin kar rahaa tha
 As a result, he had no desire to do or disobey that work
 uddeshy or lakshya main antar he
 The prosecutor can give evidence on the motive of a conviction, although he is not obliged to do so
 un maamalon, jahaan ichha kii nirdoshita bachaav main pesh kii ja sakati he uddeshy kii nirdoshita bachaav nahin he
 Invalid work cannot be created by law on the basis that it has been done with good purpose

 There is a definite concept in English legislation that a child below the age of eight years cannot commit a crime
 bhartiya kanoon main yah saat saal tak hi simit he
 If a child, who is between 8-14 years of age, commits a crime in which wicked will is required, then according to the concept of law, he will not be able to understand that he is committing a crime
 at: maamla chalaanevaale par yah pramanbhaar rahegaa ki ukt balak ko aparaadh samajhane kii kshamta thi
 There is a definite concept of law that a child does not have knowledge of sexual intercourse for less than 14 years
 at: vah balaatkaar kiya balaatkaar karne ke lakshya se akraman ke liye dandit nahin ho saktaa
 Evidence cannot be given on this subject that a child under 14 years of age is capable of sexual intercourse due to physical development
 kintu yadi vah 14 saal se adhik avasthaa ke kisi vyakti ko sambhog kriya main sahaayta de to vah hoga
 No child below the age of 14 years will be considered an accomplice in unnatural crime under any circumstances
 14 saal se adhik avasthaa kaa prayek vyakti kanoon kii drushti main paryaapt gyaan rakhata he
 Therefore, he will be held guilty for his crime
 jahaan aisa pramanit kiya jaay ki jis vyakti ne aparaadh kiya he, vah aparaadh karne ke samay veikshipt maansik dasha main rahane ke kaaran apane kiye aparaadh ke fal ko samajhane main aksham tha, to vah aparaadh ke liye uttaradaayi nahin hoga or na apradhi hi kaha jaayga
 Whether or not a person was insane at the time of committing the crime is a matter of fact and not of law
 veikshiptata kaa pramanbhaar abhiyukt par he
 Expert evidence is not mandatory
 yah bhi aavashyak nahin ki pratiraksha ke sakshiyon ke dwaara sakshya diya jaay
 The responsibility of proof can be fulfilled by the remorse of the witnesses of the case prosecutor
 keval yah kahana ki koi aparaadh bina uddeshy ke kiya gaya, veikshiptata siddh nahin karata
 In such cases the jury's verdict is "criminal but insane"
 apradhi ko raja kinwa raashtrapati kii maraji kii avadhi paryant jail main rakhaa jaataa he
 The culprit cannot be called guilty or punished
 at: use apil karne kaa adhikaar nahin rahata
 Moral insanity is irrelevant in this context
 arthath yadi yah kaha jaay ki aparaadh ke samay apradhi kii medhasakti thik thi, kintu uskaa naitik chintan skhlit ho chukaa tha athwa vah mastishk ke asanyamit pravaah ke vasheebhoot hokar medha shakti ke rahete hue bhi aparaadh kar baitha, to uskaa aparaadh kshamya nahin hoga
 Ordinarily, a person who voluntarily becomes intoxicated by consuming drugs, cannot be free from the liability of crime, because a drunk or drunk person also has the ability to understand the target of the crime
 kintu nasha yaa pramattata jab is seemaa tak pahunch chuki ho ki isse asthaayee veikshiptata aa gai he, to abhiyukt kaa yah bachaav anya kaarnon se utpann veikshiptata ke samaan hoga
 In the crime in which the target is necessary, it can be seen with other evidence by giving evidence on the substance that the target is committed in the crime
 par veikshiptata kaa sakshya saadhaarant: lagu nahin hota
 If a person is compelled to show fear of physical torture and commits an offense as per the order of someone, who would have been imprisoned if done otherwise voluntarily, then he is free from the obligation of impunity
 kintu jo vyakti aparaadh karne ko use baadhya karata he, vah doshi he
 But this rescue can be valid only when there is an immediate fear of dying
 yadi koi vyakti naitik bal se prabhavit hokar koi aparaadh kare to vah kshamya nahin hoga
 If someone is bound to obey the officer above him and commits a crime by obeying the said officer, his crime will not be excusable, although he cannot be accused of rancor
 raja par dandabhiyog nahin lagaaya ja saktaa, kyonki vah kanoon kii drushti main aparaadh karne main aksham he
 With the intention of maintaining mutual harmony between different nations, the king or his ambassador of one country cannot be brought in cases of unjust punishment in countries
 parliment ke sadsy dandabhiyog ke niyamon ke andar hai, kintu sadan main die gaye apane bhaashan ke liye ve abhiyukt nahin banaae ja sakate
 Because of the development and public interest of the Republic, they have been given full freedom of speech so that they can review any person fearlessly
 aisi aashaa kii jaati he ki ve apane adhikaar kaa durupyog na karenge
