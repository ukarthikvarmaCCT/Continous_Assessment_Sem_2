 During the making of his previously directed film Kites, director Anurag Basu wrote a two-page short story which was later followed by Barfi! Developed into a script
 basu kii likhi patakatha or film kaa vaachan do samyaavadhiyon ke bich aage-peeche jate hai
 Basu says that the film-script demands a 30-year time frame for the characters, so the film's background was set in 1970
 june 2010 main, anuraag basu ne pushti kii ki film main teen log, ek baharaa or goonga aadmi, ek maansik rup se viklang ladki or ek vaachak pramukh bhoomika main honge
 Although Basu had specified that the film would be hilarious, media reports about the film's former titles such as Silence or Silence say the story is grim and dark
 basu ke anusaar unhone baster kiton or charlie chaplin kii mook filmon ke daur se prerit shaareerik kamedi kaa prayog in kalakaaron ko shradhanjali ke rup main kiya tha
 Director Anurag Basu took the decision to cast Ranbir Kapoor in the film before he started writing the screenplay and Katrina Kaif was the first choice as his reader
 march 2010 main, da times of india ne prativedit kiya tha ki ranbir kapur or katrina caff ko film main mukhya bhoomika ke liye tathaa sheershak khamoshi chun liya gaya he uske baad sheershak ko badalakar silence kar diya gaya, basu ne isaki pushti bhi kii thi
 Basu wanted to film a new girl from Kolkata to play the role of a self-styled girl
 basu kii patni ne is abhinay ke liye chopra kaa naam sujhaayaa tha
 But Basu feared that the audience would see "priyanka Chopra" as the famous actress and not the character
 basu kaa kahana tha ki, "mujhe dar tha ki main jhilmil ke paatr ke rup main priyanka chopra dekh rahaa houngaa or jhilmil paatr thik tarah se darshana sambhav nahin ho paaegaa
 This has happened to a lot of films where known faces have damaged the character
 " priyanka chopra ne kuch bhaag nibhaayaa lekin isaki ghoshnaa nahin kii gayi kyonki basu pehle is par kaary karke dekhnaa chaahate the ki yah kaisaa rahata he
 After a three-day workshop, Chopra became convinced that Chopra could act as a self-styled girl and reflected that she was happy that she chose Priyanka for the role
 baad main, basu ne pratyaksh rup main kaha ki unhone svaparayan kaa abhinay karne ke liye chopra ke alaava kisi anya se aagrah nahin kiya
 After Chopra was selected in the film, Kaif dropped the plan for unknown reasons
 media ne prativedit kiya ki chopra ko majboot abhinay vaala bhaag milane ke kaaran unhone apane aap ko film se baahar kar liya hoga
 Later, the media reported that Asin had proposed to act as a reader in place of Kaif
 yadhyapi asin ne film main kabhi kisi prastaav ko nahin chunaa
 According to media reports, no other actress wants to act in the film because according to her, the autistic part is very strong
 july 2010 main, mumbai mirar ne likhaa ki chopra vaachak kaa abhinay karne ko raji hai or svaparayan ke abhinay ko chhod rahi hai, atah anya abhinetri ko film ke liye nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he; chopra nahin chaahati ki film rukii rahe

 In the first half of December 2010, Ileana d'cruz was selected for the second lead female performance of Vachhak and Kapoor's first love
 ranbir kapur ne film main ek bahere or gunge aadmi kaa abhinay kiya
 According to Ranbir, he drew inspiration from screen legends such as Academy Award-winning actor, Roberto Benigni, Charlie Chaplin and his grandfather Raj Kapoor
 nayak kii shaareerik viklaangata ke kaaran, basu kisi bhi sanket bhashaa kaa upyog nahin karnaa chaahate the, lekin film main kuch vyaavhaarik pratimaanon kaa upyog hua he
 Kapoor described his character as saying that he is a good-natured and good-hearted man
 film main ranbir ke abhinay ke bare main unke pita rishi kapur sabase alag vichaar rakhte hai
 According to him - "he does not like Ranbir's films as an actor, because i do not see in him that which is seen in a great actor
 " Priyanka Chopra has acted as Jhilmil
 basu ke anusaar chopra kaa abhinay film kaa sabase mushkil bhaag tha
 To prepare for her role, Chopra went to various mental institutions and spent time with self-styled people
 unka kahana he ki unhone abhinay ke liye is par shodh kiya tha kyonki bharat main svaparayanata kii sthiti ke bare main jaagrukta bahut kam he
 Chopra said that as a Hindi film heroine, she probably faced every possibility of obstruction
 unhone ullikhit kiya ki unhen jhilmil banane ke liye do pal kii aavashyaktaa he kyonki vah uske soch va vyavhaar main bhinnata hone ke kaaran uske charitra ko samaj nahin paayi
 d'cruz, who narrates the story as the narrator and plays the film's lead male character's first love, says, "shruti is such a sensitive role for acting as if she was in another stage in the film She goes away
 " basu ke anusaar, kapur, chopra or di'cruge ke paatro ke pashchaat saurabh shukla abhinit paatr inspector datta sabase mahatvapurn he
 Basu described the character as "amazing" when the other characters cry when he laughs

 From the beginning, the word 'aakhya' or 'anushruti' has been generally used in the meaning of a story or a story

 The narrative in Sahityadarpan has been called a "purported statement"

 But there are some such fundamental oppositions present in Sanskrit iconographies that they cannot be considered synonymous with each other
 sanskrit main aakhyayika kii shrenee kii ek gadhybaddh rachana or bhi hoti thi, jise 'katha' kehete the
 Bhamah calls the Saras story composed in beautiful prose in Kavyalankar a "legend"
 yah uchhvaason main banti hoti thi ore isamen nayak apane vrutt tathaa cheshtaa kaa varnan swayan karata tha
 Vectra and impostor verses used to come in between, while the narrative did not contain verses and impostor verses, nor was it divided into exorcisms
 shri parashuram chaturvedi ne likhaa he ki "aakhyayika" kii visheshta is baat main pai jaati he ki vah swayan kisi apane paatr dwaara hi kahi gai hoti he jis kaaran uski bahut si baaten atmodgarparak ban jaati hai
 The original meaning of the term "narrative" with premeditation also has to be pointed towards such a feature
 "mahabharat" evam "ramayana" ke "aakhyaan" kahe jane kii sarthakata bhi kadachit isi baat main nihit hogi ki unke rachayita kramash: vyas evam valmiki ne apni dekhi suni baaten hin likhi thim, unamem kalpana kaa vaisaa ansh nahin rahata, jo katha ke sambandh main praaia: aavashyak mana jaae karata he
 For this reason, the term narrative can be called more "chronological" and accordingly pure
 atev premakahani ke bhi mul rup main vastut: "aapbeetee" jaisi hi hone se "prem" shabd ke saath kiye gaye iske prayog ko sarvatha upyukt samajhnaa chahie 
 In the above lines, Chaturvedi has tried to prove the narrative to be a reference to the story through narration rather than saying it directly
 ek anya sthal par bhi, kintu jaraa adhik spasht dhang se, vah yahi baat duhraate hai, ""premakhyaan" kaa "aakhyaan" shabd mulat: aakhyayika kaa hi ek roopaantar sa prathit hota he
 "" kisi kathakriti ko aakhyaan sangya dene ke liye yadi yah nitant aavashyak ho ki uske rachayita ne katha ko swayan "dekha suna" ho to ramayana evam mahabharat ke sandarbh main abhi tak aise pramaan athwa sakshya uplabdh nahin hai ki unke aadhaar par nishcint hokar yah kah diya jae ki unke rachayitaaon ne vahi sab kuch likhaa jo swayan unhone "dekha suna" tha
 Also, is the term "seen and heard" not a sign of ambiguous and uncertain meaning in itself? There must have been some other reason for naming "akhyana" to Astu, Ramayana and Mahabharata
 vaidic sahitya se lekar hindi sahitya tak jitne bhi aakhyaan granth milte hai yaa jinhen aakhyaanak granth mana jaataa he, unamem se koi ekaadh "apekshaakrit adhik vrittantaparak or tadnusaar vishuddh" ho to ho, shesh kalpanapradhan hi he
 What is the point of fiction and narrative texts, imagination has engulfed the history badly even in texts and texts
 dow shambhunath singh ne adikalin aakhyaanak nritygiton se nrity, sangeet or aakhyaan teenon kaa vikaas mana he
 Later on, he has also said that the realities of these stories are mythological, personal, contemporary and fanciful; These four types of characters, events and situations are formed
 pan hajaari prasad dvivedi ne bhi aakhyaan ko aakhyayika se pruthak ek lokavidha mana he, yatha ""parantu jansadharan kaa ek or vibhaag, jisamen dharm kaa sthaan nahin tha, jo apbhransh sahitya ke pashchimi aakar se sidhe chalaa aa rahaa tha, jo gaanvon kii baithkon main kathanak rup se or gaan rup se chal rahaa tha, upekshit hone laga tha
 These Sufi seekers took their shelter to the public only by taking shelter from the popular folkloric stories in exchange for mythological narratives
 "" vastut: aakhyaan ko aakhyayika siddh karne ke kaaran hi chaturvedi ji ko ukt sab kuch kahana karnaa padaa
 Not only this, this trait of the eponymous "legend" —in which the protagonist himself described his circle and effort — had to be imagined to be "akin to an apathy in the core of a love story" in order to reduce it to narrative
 sahitya nirantar gatisheel he
 Therefore, it keeps changing, adding, modifying and refining its genres and the characteristics are fixed only with the literary genres, they cannot be forcefully reduced
 isiilie bhamah ke baad dandi ne kavyadarsh main katha or aakhyayika ko ek hi shrenee kii rachanaayen maanate hue kaha he ki kahani nayak kahe yaa koi or kahe, adhyay kaa vibhaajan ho yaa na ho, adhyyon kaa naam uchhvas rakhaa jaae yaa lamb, bich main vaktra, apavaktra chand aaen athwa na aaen, kahani main koi antar nahin padataa
 Therefore, due to these upper distinctions one should distinguish between "katha" and "fable"
 naveen shatee main acharya rudrat ne to tatkaaleen prachlit sahitya ke aadhaar par yahan tak kah diya tha ki keval sanskrit main nibaddh kathaon ke liye gadhy main likhane kaa bandhan he; parantu anya bhashaaon main likhi janevaali rachanaayen padya main bhi likhi ja sakati hai
 Prakrit and apabhramsa from "other languages" are pointed here
 at: siddh he ki uganuroop saahitiyik vidhaon ke maandand badalte rahete hai
 Dandi has also considered the entire narrative caste under narrative and legend, such as - at: spasht he ki dandi ke samay main bhi aakhyaan jativaachak shabd tha
 The Mahabharata has a compilation of many anecdotes and anecdotes, so it must have been called the Akhyakavya
 ramayana ko bhi aakhyaan sangya dene kaa kaaran sambhavat: yahi rahaa hoga
 In Hindi, the term "narrative" is often used as an ordinary story or a narrative
 isiilie premakhyanak kaavyon ke antargat katha, charit, vaarta, duha, chaupai yaa chaupai, raas aadi sabhi kavyavidhaayen prapya hai
 The proof of the authority of the narratives is available to us in the Rigveda Code
 atharvaveda main itihaas tathaa puraana kaa ullekh maukhik sahitya ke rup main na hokar likhit granth ke rup main kiya gaya miltaa he
 Among the various sects of the Vedas' lectures, Yask has mentioned the sect of historians several times, according to which the "vrittra" is the noun of the Tvastra asura and his fierce struggle with the lord of the gods Indra and Tumul Sangram are described in the mantras of the Rigveda
 
 is sampradaay ke vyakhyakaaron kii sammati main vedon main mahatvapurn aakhyaan vidyaman hai
 The number of lectures in the Rigveda is not small
 inamen se kuch aakhyaan to vaiyaktik devtaa ke vishay main hai or kuch kisi samuhik ghatana ko lakshya kar pravrutt hote hai
 In the Rigveda, there are also many stories about Indra and Ashwin, in which the spirit of valor, valor and benevolence of these Gods is clearly mentioned
 rugveda ke bheetar 30 aakhyaanon kaa spasht nirdesh kiya gaya he jinamein se katipay prakhyat aakhyaan ye hai-shun:shape, agastya or lopamudra, gritsamad, vasishtha or vishwamitra, som kaa avataran, tryarun or vrushjan, agni kaa janm, shyavashv, brihaspati kaa janm, raja sudas, nahush, apala, nabhaanedishth, vrishakpi, urvashi or pururava, sarama or pani, devaapi or shantanu, nachiketa ,
 Apart from these, the names of many kings are available in the donations which inspired many sages to write mantras in their praise
 in stutiyon main bhi katipay aakhyaanon kii ore spasht sanket vidyaman hai
 Vedic texts other than the Rigveda also give details of the narratives
 inamen se katipay aakhyaan to ekadam naveen hai, parantu kuch rugveda main sanketit aakhyaanon ke hi paribrunhit rup hai
 In the "sekhanani literature" associated with the Rigveda, particularly in Brihadevata and Sarvanukramani, these narratives also narrate detailed incidents in Nirukta, Neetimanjari and Sayan Bhasya
 puraanon main bhi ye aakhyaan varnit hai, parantu inaki ghatnaon main kahin hraas or kahin paribrinhan drushtigochar hota he
 The Brahmins and Shrutasutras also furnish the necessary material for the study of their development
 udaahranarth sobhari kaanv kaa aakhyaan, jo rugveda ke anek sookhton main sanketit he, bhagwat main vistaar se varnit he 
 In addition to being mentioned in the Rigveda, the narrative of Shyavash Atreya is also mentioned in the numerology Srotasutra
 chyavaan bhargav tathaa sukanya maanvi kaa aakhyaan rugveda ke anek sookhton main sanketit hokar tandya brahman, nirukt, shatapath brahman tathaa shrimadbhagwat puraana main vistaar ke saath varnit he
 Thus enormous material for the development of Vedic narratives is available with interesting detail within the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas
 aakhyaanon kaa taatpary kya he, is prashn ke uttar ke sambandh main vidwaanon main paryaapt matbhed he
 American scholar Dr
 Bloomfield has refuted the views of scholars who have presented mystic interpretations of these narratives
 udaahranarth ye rahasywaadee vidvan pururava ke aakhyaan ke bheetar ek gambhir rahasy kaa darshan karte hai
 In his eyes, Pururava is the Sun and Urvashi Usha
 ushaa or surya kaa paraspar sanyog kshanik hi hota he
 The duration of their separation is very long
 viyogi hone par surya ushaa kii khoj main din bhar ghumaa karata he, tab kahin jaakar phir duusare din praat:kaal donon kaa samagam hota he
 This was the form of interpretation of the Vedic people of ancient India
 parantu aakhyaanon ko unke maanviya mulya se vanchit rakhana nyaayay or upyukt nahin prathit hota
 It is necessary to pay attention to two facts regarding the practice of these narratives: aakhyaanon kii shiksha maanav samaaj ke samuhik kalyaan tathaa vishvamangala kii abhivruddhi ke nimitt he
 According to Indian culture, both humans and gods are interconnected
 manushya yagyon main devon ke liye aahuti detaa he, jo prasann hokar uski abhilaashaa purna karte hai or apane prasadon kii vrishti unke upar nirantar karte rahete hai
 The narratives of Indra and Ashwin are vivid examples
 yajmaan ke dwaara die gaye somras kaa paan kar indra nitant prasann hote hai or uski kaamana ko safal banaate hai
 They disintegrate the monster of inversion from their thunderbolt and they all flow to the rivers
 vrishti se maanav aapyaayit hote hai
 Peace prevails in the world
 kalidas ne is vaidic tathy ko badi sundarataa se abhivyakt kiya he 
 At the end of each narrative there are underlying facts for human learning
 apala aatreyi kaa aakhyaan naricharitra kii udaattata tathaa tejaswita kaa vishad pratipadak he
 The narratives of the King Trierun Travrishna and Vrishajan; Rigvidhan 12
52; Brihadevata 5
14
23 The Vedic period clearly indicates the importance and dignity of the priest
 sobhari kaanv kaa aakhyaan sangati ke mahatv kaa pratipaadan karata he
 Ushti Chakrayan's narrative is a plausible tale of the collective impact of food and pride
 shyavashv aatreya kii katha rishi ke gaurav ko, prem kii mahima ko tathaa kavi kii sadhana ko badi sundar reeti se abhivyakt karti he
 This is the famous pranayakahani of the Rigvedic era, in which, for the accomplishment of love, Satyāvāश्वa becomes a sage by virtue of penance
 dadhyang atharvan kaa aakhyaan raashtra ke mangal ke liye apane jeevandaan kii shiksha dekar hamen kshudra swaarth se upar uthne kaa or raashtra kaa kalyaan karne kaa gauravmay upadesh detaa he
 It is in the Puranas that his name is the sage Dadhichi, who protected the Aryan civilization by giving Indra his bones to make Vajra to kill Vritra
 anadhikari ko rahasyavidya ke upadesh kaa visham parinaam is vaidic aakhyaan main dikhalaayaa gaya he
 Behind all these narratives is the sermon - unwavering reverence in God and close love with man
 katipay rishiyon kii charitrik trutiyon tathaa aniatik aacharnon kaa bhi varnan vaidic tathaa unka anusaran karanevaale mahabharat or puraanon main paae janevaale aakhyaanon main uplabdh hota he
 a plot is specified only to avoid falling into the pit of immorality
 puraanon main bhi ye hi aakhyaan bahush: varnit hai, parantu inke rup main vaishamy he
 Through comparative studies, it appears that many narratives take their purely Vedic form of distortion due to a changed attitude or different social and religious situation
 vikaas kii prakriya main anek avaantar ghatnaayen bhi us aakhyaan ke saath sanshlisht hokar use ek nayaa rup pradaan karti hai, jo kabhi-kabhi mul aakhyaan ke nitant viruddh siddh hota he
 Shun: The followings of the stories of Shep and Vashist Vishwamitra exemplify the performance of this principle
 rugveda main nirdisht shun:shape kaa yah aakhyaan aitarey brahman main nae rup main, naveen ghatnaon se sanwalit hokar uplabdh hota he
 Now here this narrative initially takes a new form by associating with Rohitashva, the son of King Harishchandra and with the sage Vishwamitra in the story
 uske anya do bhaaiyon kii satta, uske pita kaa daridray, uske vikray aadi kii samast ghatnaayen kathanak main rochakata laane ke peeche se gadhi gai prathit hoti hai
 The meaning of "shun: Shape" also has no relation to the dog
 "shun" kaa arth he sukh, kalyaan tathaa "shape" kaa arth he stambh yaa khambha
 Therefore, "shun: Shape" itself means "column of Soukhya"

 prakhyat aakhyaan shun:shape kaa aakhyaan rugveda ke anek sookhton main bahush: sanketit hone se satya ghatana ke upar ashrith prathit hota he
 This narrative is described in great detail in Aitareya Brahmana, in which it has been enhanced by adding the relation of King Harishchandra and finally Vishwamitra
 varun kii krupa ikshvaku naresh harishchandra ko putr utpann hona, samarpan ke samay uskaa jangal main bhaag janaa, harishchandra ko udrarog kii prapti, raste main ajigart ke madhyam putr shun:shape kaa kray karnaa, devataaon kii krupa se uskaa vadhyapashu hone se batch janaa, vishwamitra ke dwaara uskaa kritakputra banaaya janaa, aadi ghatnaayen prakhyat hai

 The famous Sukta of the Rigveda contains only the narration of Pururva and Urvashi; But in the Shatapatha Brahmana, this plot is fixed with interesting detail and literary beauty is also introduced in the pranayakha
 vishnupurana, matsaypurana tathaa bhagwat main isi katha kaa rochak vivaran ham pate hai
 Kalidas in the "vikramorvashiya" trotak has given this plot a very dramatic look
 is aakhyaan ke vikaas main ek vishesh tathy kii satta milti he
 The Puranas have taken the basis of the Matsyapurana and inscribed it as Pranayagatha

 The Vedic name of Chyavan is "chyvan"
 sukanya kii vaidic kahani uski puranic kahani kii apeksha kahin adhik udaatt or adarshamayi he
 In the Purana, Sukanya commits a crime by piercing the glowing eyes of the sage and is punished for this
 parantu veda main uskaa tyaag ucch koti kaa he
 Sukanya surrenders to the aged Chyavan Rishi for the prevention of crime committed by the military boys

 Infantry units can also occupy buildings and use them as a barricade or a front for defense against attack but this limits the range of their firing range because infantry is a stable, forward target and Unsafe, there is a possibility of eavesdropping firing and surround it
 iske alaava, morche ke andar hone kii sthiti main paidal sena kii ikaiyaan keval khidakiyon yaa imaarat main banaaye hue chhed ke jariye hi goli chalaa sakati he
 Some weapons are highly effective against units hidden in the building, such as weapons placed in a satchel or rocket launchers located near infantry, can demolish a building, blast shells from tanks and explode from the scriptures
 With fitted infantry or tanks you can set the building on fire and burn all the people hidden in it

 Normal red blood cells are flexible enough to allow cells to transform so that they can pass through capillaries
 In sickle cell disease, low-oxygen tension promotes the formation of red blood cell sickles, and the continuous process of sickle formation destroys cell membranes and reduces cell elasticity
 ye koshikaayen, saamaanya oxigen tanaav ke behaal hone par dobaaraa saamaanya aakaar main aane main asafal hoti hai
 As a result, these hardened blood cells become unable to deform when passing through narrow capillaries, resulting in vascular-contradiction and endemic anemia

 Typically, humans have hemoglobin a in the body, which is made up of two alpha and two beta chains, hemoglobin A2, which is made up of two alpha and two delta chains, and hemoglobin F, which is two alpha and two gamma chains
 Is made up of inamen se, haemoglobin A, manushyon main saamaanya haemoglobin kaa kareeb 96-97% hota he
 In normal hemoglobin A, glutamic acid occupies the sixth position of the beta chain, whereas in sickle cell disease, this glutamic acid is replaced by valine that induces the formation of sickle cell
 yah ek, ekal bindu utparivartan ke kaaran hota he
 This induces the polymerization process of the two beta chains and therefore their form is similar to that of the puzzle; Which means that they fit into each other, forming a longitudinal polymer that deforms and extremely hardens the cell, resulting in vascular occlusion

 Sore distress is treated symptomatically with analgesics; Opioid administration is required at regular intervals in pain care until the crisis ends
 The subgroup of patients is looked after in NSAID for less dangerous distress
 For more severe crises, most patients require intra-operative patient care for intravenous opioids; Analgesic controlled patient devices are commonly used in this adjustment

 The origin of the mutation that inspired the sickle cell gene was initially understood in the Arabian Peninsula, which spread across Asia and Africa
 It is now known by the evaluation of chromosomal structures, which there are at least four independent mutagenic events, of which three are in Africa and the fourth in Saudi Arabia or central India

 But Tishirakshita could not forget it
 jab ek baar ashok biimaar padaa tab tishyarakshita ne uski bharpoor seva karke munhamaaga var praapt karne kaa vachan usase le liya
 When Kunal was sent to suppress him at the rebellion in Taxila, Tishirakshita received the Rajmudra of Emperor, Ashoka in his selection, and sent a stamped order to the ministers of Taxila to take out Kunal's eyes and kill him

 By taking advantage of this opportunity, the task of making Italy's problem Europe's problem and the sympathy of European states against Austria was the result of Kavur's diplomacy

 France pledged military aid to Italy according to the agreement reached between Emperor Napoleon III of France and Kavur
 uttari italy se austria ke shashan kaa ant hone par nise or sevoy pradeshon ko, jo france tathaa italy ke madhya sthit the, france ko de dene kaa bhi nishchay hua
 Kavur began to encourage revolutionary parties in the states of Italy

 With the encouragement of Kavur, the revolutionaries of Lombardy and Venezia started opposing the Austrian rule
 iske atirikt pidmant main nirantar prasha kaa anukaran karke sainik shakti sanghathan bhi aarambh kar diya gaya
 The rulers of Austria were frightened by these protests and ordered Kavur to disband the newly recruited army
 parantu kavur to isi avasar kii pratiksha main tha
 Therefore, on 18 April 1859, a war was declared on behalf of Austria

 But Napoleon III changed his policy at this time

 Although Kavur did not support Garibaldi's revolutionary manner and feared dissolution of Garibaldi's military power, he was successful because of Garibaldi's great support and the territories came under the King of Padimant

 lahore prastaavna,, san 1940 main akhil bhartiya muslim lig dwaara prastaavit ek aadhikarik rajnatik sankalpana thi jise muslim lig ke 22 se 24 march 1940 main chale teen divasiy lahore satr ke dauraan paarit kiya gaya tha
 The proposal called for "independent princely states" for Muslims, allegedly in the northwestern eastern regions of British India, and to make the provinces included in the said units autonomous and sovereign
 tatpashchaat, yah sankalpana "bharat ke musalamaanon" ke liye pakistan naamak main ek alag swatantra swytt mulk banane kii maang karne main parivartit ho gaya
 Although the name Pakistan had already been proposed by Chaudhary Chaudhary Rahmat Ali, by 1933, Majloom Haq Mohammad Ali Jinnah and other Muslim leaders were firm on the principle of Hindu Muslim unity, but the partition encouragement misconceptions constantly being promoted by the British
 Hindus had aroused a sense of mistrust and hatred towards Muslims
 a sensitive political environment had also promoted the proposal of Pakistan is prastaav kii peshi ke upalaksh main prativarsh 23 march ko pakistan main yom-e-pakistan ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The historic resolution was passed at the end of the three-day annual meeting of the All India Muslim League at Minto Park, Lahore on 23 March, on the basis of which the Muslim League started the movement for the acquisition of a separate country of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent and After seven years, it was successful in getting its demand passed
 upmahadweep main british raaj dwaara satta janata ko saunpane kii prakriya ke pehle charan main 1936 / 1937 main pehle aam chunaav hue the unamem muslim lig ko buree tarah se haar uthaani padi thi or uske is daawey ko gambhir nicha pahunchi thi ki vah upmahadweep ke musalamaanon ke ekmaatr pratinidhi sabha he
 Therefore, the morale of the Muslim League leadership and workers was shattered and there was a strange sense of helplessness on them
 congress ko madras, you pi, si pi, bihar or urisa main spasht bahumat hasil hui thi, seemaa or bombay main usne duusare dalon ke saath milakar gathbandhan sarkaar kaa gathan kiya tha or sindh or assam main jahaan muslim haaavee the congress ko kaaphi safalataa mili thi
 In Punjab, however, the head of Inam Hussain's uninusset Party and in Bengal Maulvi Kripa Haq's Praja Krishak Party won
 garaz bharat ke 11 praanton main se kisi ek rajya main bhi muslim lig ko satta praapt na ho sakaa
 In these circumstances, the Muslim League, it seemed, is diverging from the political stream of the subcontinent
 is dauraan congress ne jo pehali baar satta ke nashe main kuch zyada hi sir shaar thi, aise upaay kiye jinase musalamaanon ke dilon main bhay or khataron ne janm lenaa shuru kar diya
 As the Congress declared Hindi as the national language, the Gao decay was banned and the Congress tricolor was given the status of the national flag
 is maamle main muslim lig kii satta khone ke saath apane netritv main yah bhaavana paidaa ho rahaa tha ki muslim lig satta se is aadhaar par vanchit kar di gai he ki vah apane aap ko musalamaanon kii pratinidhi sabha kehalaati he
 This was the starting point for the awareness of the spirit of two separate nations led by the Muslim League
 isi dauraan dwitiya vishwa yuddh samarthan ke badale satta kii bharpoor hastantaran ke masale par british raaj or congress ke bich charchaa bhadkaa or congress satta se alag ho gai to muslim lig ke liye kuch daravaaje khulte dikhaai die
 And in this background, this 3-day meeting of All India Muslim League in Lahore started on 22 March
 baithak se 4 din pehle lahore main allamaa purvi ke deen party ne pabandi todate hue ek sainya parade kii thi jise rokane ke liye police ne golibari kii
 Around 35 Deen were killed
 is ghatana kii vajah se lahore main jabardast tanaav tha or punjab main muslim lig kii sahyogi party uninst party satta thi or is baat kaa khatra tha ki deen ke fawda vaahak kaaryakarta, muslim lig kaa yah baithak na hone den yaa is avasar par hangaamaa barapa he
 Incidentally, in view of the seriousness, Muhammad Ali Jinnah addressed the inaugural session in which he said for the first time that the problem in India is not communal, but Ben International means it is a problem of two countries
 unhone kaha ki hinduon or musalamaanon main antar itnaa bada or spasht he ki ek kendriya sarkaar ke tahat unka gathbandhan khataron se bharpoor hoga
 He said that there is only one way in this matter that i have different afflictions
 duusare din inhen padon par 23 march ko is samay ke bengal ke mukhyamantri maulavee krupa haq ne sankalp lahore diya jisamen kaha gaya tha ki is tab tak koi sanvaidhanik yojana na to vyavhaarya hoga or na musalamaanon ko hoga jab tak ek duusare se mili hue bhugolic ikaayiyon alag gaanaa kshetron main parisemen na ho
 The resolution said that in these areas where Muslims have a numerical majority, such as the Northwest and Northeast regions of India, they should be set free by combining them with units that have high autonomy and sovereignty
 maulavee inaam ul dwaara kii peshkash kii is sankalp kaa samarthan upi ke muslim legi netaa choudhary riek lsamaan, punjab moulana jafar ali khan, seemaa se sardaar aurangzeb sindh se sir abdulla haaron or baluchistan se kaaji isa ne kii
 The resolution was passed in the closing session on 23 March
 april san 1941 main madras main muslim lig ke sammelan main sankalp lahore ko party ke samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya or isi ke aadhaar par pakistan andolan shuru hui
 But even then these areas were not clearly identified, including the demand for separate Muslim states
 pehali baar pakistan kii maang ke liye kshetron kii pahchaan 7 april san 1946 dilli ke teen divasiy sammelan main kii gai jisamen kendriya or prantiy vidhansabhaon ke muslim legi sadasyon ne bhaag liya tha
 At this conference, a resolution was passed to present the demand of the Muslim League to the delegation of the Cabinet Mission coming from Britain, which was drafted by two members of the Executive of the Muslim League, Chaudhary Riksalam and Hassan Isfahani
 is karaadaad main spasht rup se pakistan main shaamil kiye jane vaale kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai thi
 Bengal and Assam in the northeast and Punjab, Seema, Sindh and Balochistan in the northwest
 aashcharya kii baat he ki is sankalp main kashmir kaa koi zikr nahin tha haalanki uttar pashchim main muslim bahul kshetra tha or punjab se judaa hua tha
 It is very important that the two states were completely omitted from the Delhi Convention in this resolution, which was very clear in the resolution Lahore, instead it was demanded as the only state of Pakistan
 shaayad bahut kam logon ko yah pataa he ki sankalp lahore kaa mul masauda us jamaane ke punjab ke uninst mukhyamantri sar sikandar hayaat khan ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The Uniunsat party was integrated into the Muslim League at that time and the head Sikandar Hayat Khan was the President of the Punjab Muslim League
 sir sikandar hayaat khan ne sankalp ke mul masaude main upmahadweep main ek kendriya sarkaar ke aadhaar par lagbhag condereshan prastaavit thi lekin jab masauda muslim lig subject cameti main vichaar kiya gaya to kaayade ajam mohammad ali jinna ne khud is masaude main ekmaatr centre sarkaar kaa ullekh moulik kaat diya
 The head Sikandar Hayat Khan was strongly angry on this and stated clearly in the Punjab Legislative Assembly on 11 March 1941 that his vision of Pakistan was mainly different from the principles of Jinnah Saheb
 unka kahana tha ki vah bharat main ek ore hindu raaj or duusari ore muslim raaj ke aadhaar par vitaran ke sakht khilaaf hai or vah aisi bakaul unke vinaashkari vitaran kaa datakar muqabla karenge
 But this did not happen
 sir sikandar hayaat khan duusare varsh san 1942 main 50 saal kii umr main nidhan ho gaya yun punjab main mohammad ali jinna teevr virodh ke uthte hue hisar se mukti mil gai
 In the Delhi session of 1946, the resolution of Pakistan was presented by Sankalp Hussain Shaheed Sohrawardy and it was praised by the Muslim Legion leader of UP, Chaudhary Riyakalsam
 sankalp lahore pesh karne vaale maulavee krupa haq is sammelan main shariq nahin hue kyonki unhen sun 1941 main muslim lig sekharaj kar diya gaya tha
 At the Delhi conference, Abu Alhashm, the leader of Bengal, strongly opposed this resolution and argued that this resolution is quite different from the Lahore resolution which is part of the constitution of the Muslim League - he said that the resolution was clearly in Lahore in two states There was no option to amend this basic resolution of the Muslim League to the Delhi Convention
 abavaalhashm ke anusaar kaayade ajam ne isi sammelan main or baad main bombay main ek baithak main yah samajhaayaa tha ki is samay ke baad upmahadweep main do alag samvidhan vidhansabhaon ke gathan kii baat ho rahi he to dilli kanvension sankalp main ek rajya kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 But when the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan sets the constitution, it will be the final arbiter of this problem and it will have full authority to decide the formation of two separate states
 lekin pakistan kii samvidhan sabha ne na to kaayade ajam jivan main or na jab san 1956 main desh kaa pehla samvidhan paarit ho rahaa tha upmahadweep main musalamaanon kii do swatantra or swytt rajyon ke sthapana par vichaar kiya
 After 25 years of political upheaval and conflict and the destruction of the Bangladesh war in Sun 1971, but two different afflictions of Muslims emerged in the subcontinent, whose resolution is still safe in the case of Lahore

 FEEDRICH AUGUST KECULA Eminent Chemist

 wilhem dwitiya yaa wiliam dwitiya germany kaa antim samraat tathaa prasha kaa raja tha jisane german samrajya evam prasha par 15 june 1888 se 9 navambar 1918 tak shashan kiya
 After the death of William I, his son Fadric III ascended the throne of Germany on 9 March 1888 AD
 kintu keval 100 din rajya karne ke baad uski mrityu ho gai
 On his death, his son William II ascended the throne
 vah ek navayuvak tha
 It was a combination of many qualities and fortifications
 vah kushagra buddhi, mahatvakankshi aatmavishvasi tathaa asaadhaaran navayuvak tha
 He was selfish and arrogant and believed in the divine doctrine of the king
 kisi anya vyakti ke niyantran main rahanaa usko asay tha jiske kaaran kuch hi dinon ke uparaant uski apane chancelar bismark se anban ho gai
 Bismarck was forced to resign due to circumstances
 bismark ke patan ke uparaant wiliam ne samast satta ko apane haathon main liya or uske mantri aagyaakaari sevak ban gayi or vah swayan kaa shashan kaa karnadhaar bana
 William Kaiser was a very obstinate, ambitious and angry person
 vah kahata tha ki hamaara bhavishya samudr par nirbhar he
 His attempt to make Germany a maritime power had gained permanent hostility to England
 uski niti thi- 'sampurna vishwa par apana prabhutv sthapit karnaa
 'if he did not succeed in this, then he was ready for the destruction of the world
 vyapaarik desh hone ke kaaran england yuddh ke paksh main nahin tha, jise wiliam kaisar england kii kaayarta samajhataa tha
 He wanted to expand his empire by frightening England in an aggressive attitude and it was a misconception that England would want to avoid war at any cost
 is prakaar wiliam kaisar ke ugr, samrajyavaadee, nirankush tathaa swechhachari vyaktitv ne europe ko mahayuddh ke kagaar par pahunchaa diya
 Caesar William II had the following three main objectives of world policy - uparokt uddeshyon kii purti karne ke abhipraay se kaisar wiliam dwitiya ne germany kii ‘videsh niti’ kaa sanchaalan karnaa aarambh kiya
 Due to the first objective, a close alliance with Austria was necessary, as he also wanted to move in the same direction and control the port of Salonika
 iskaa arth tha, madhya europe ke kootneetijna gut ko sudrudh bananaa
 Due to the conflict between the interests of Austria and Russia, it also meant the separation from Russia and finally making it their adversary
 duusare uddeshy kii purti kaa arth tha, 'sansar main jahaan kahin bhi aavashyak ho, visheshkar africa main, germany kii shakti kaa pradarshan karnaa
 'in this regard, Morocco challenged France twice in 1905 AD and 1911 AD
 tisare uddeshy kii purti kaa spasht parinaam tha england ke saath teevr pratisparddha or vaimnasy
 In summary, the natural consequence of this new policy was the hostility of Russia, France and England, and eventually the three of them converging in combat, that is, the destruction of all of Bismarck's work
 wiliam dwitiya ne apni niti se uski samast vyavastha ko nasht kar diya
 Within three years, Russia seceded from Germany and later ended her isolation by negotiating a treaty with France
 6 varsh ke andar england shatru ban gaya
 The hostility from France intensified with the intervention of Morocco, and by 1907, the Triassic Friendship of France, Russia and England was established in comparison with the threesome of Germany, Austria and Italy
 italy kaa trigut se sambandh bhi shithil padataa ja rahaa tha kintu wiliam dwitiya ne is disha main koi prayaas nahin kiya
 The Rehabilitation Treaty was to be repeated in 1890 AD by Bismarck in Germany and Russia, while William wanted to establish stronger ties with Austria than Russia so that he could succeed in bringing the eastern Mediterranean into his sphere of influence through the Balkans
 
 rus ne bhi is punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti ko yah kahkar manaa kar diya ki 'sandhi badi pechida he or isamen austria ke liye dhamkee maujuud he jiske bade anishtakaari parinaam ho sakate hai
 ' punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti ke na hone kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki rus akelaa rah gaya
 It became mandatory for him to find a friend to overcome his isolation
 abusake saamne uske shatru england or france hi the
 But being bound by his situation, he was attracted to befriend France and tried to befriend him
 ant main, 1895 i
 main donon deshon main sandhi hui jo dwigut sandhi ke naam se prasiddh he
 France was greatly benefited by this treaty and her loneliness ended
 wiliam bada mahatvakankshi tha
 He wanted to make Germany not only the fortune-maker of Europe, but the fortune-maker of the world
 bismark vishwa ke jhagadon se germany ko alag rakhana chahta tha,kintu wiliam ne europe ke baahar ke jhagadon main hastkshep karnaa aarambh kar diya
 He was not satisfied with German influence only in the Balkan Peninsula, but he wanted to see him as a world power
 isi uddeshy ke liye 1890 i
 ke uparaant germany kii vaideshik niti main vishwa-vyapee niti kaa samavesh hua
 Many of William's speeches reflect his views
 usne in pradeshon ko apane adhikaar main kiya - William wanted to bring Turkey under his sphere of influence and was a major part of his world policy
 england bhi is ore prayatnsheel tha
 He did not want to allow the dominance of any European nation to be established in Turkey, as this could have caused fear to his Indian empire
 1878 i
 kii berlin-congress tak turki par england kaa prabhutv rahaa or jab kabhi bhi kisi europea rastra ne us ore pragati karne kaa vichaar kiya to england ne uskaa datakar virodh kiya, parantu cyprus ke samjhaute ke uparaant uskaa prabhaav turki par se kam hone laga
 When England took control of Egypt in 1882 AD, the goodwill that existed between England and Turkey started to end
 ab wiliam dwitiya ne is paristhiti kaa laabh uthaakar turki ko apane prabhaav-kshetra main laane kaa praytn kiya
 In this regard, he took the following measures: kustuntuniya tak rail banane kaa bhi tha
 The opening of this route would have exposed Germany to the Persian Gulf, which would have become a matter of special concern for the Indian Empire of England
 wiliam turki ko apni ore aakarshith karne main avashya safal hua, kintu usne apni is niti se rus, france or england ko apana shatru bana liya jabaki turki kii shakti in teenon bade rashtron ke saamne naganya thi
 This policy of William cannot be called a successful policy
 usne teenon raashton ko ek saath aprasann kiya jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki tridaleey gut kaa nirmaan sambhav ho gaya
 By 1890, Germany and England had a good relationship, but when Germany started adopting a worldwide policy during the reign of William II, relations between Germany and England began to get tighter
 bismark ke pad tyaag karne ke uparaant wiliam ne germany kii nausena main vistaar karnaa aarambh kiya to england germany kii badhati hui shakti se sashankit hone laga tha
 For some time, the friendship of both of them increased, but after 1896 AD, the relationship between the two started getting bitter
 jab wiliam ne transwaal ke rastrapati cruger ko james ke akraman par vijay praapt karne ke upalaksh main badhai kaa taar bheja
 This wire created a great disarray among the people of England
 maharani victoria ne bhi apane pautra wiliam dwitiya ke is kaary kii badi ninda kii
 At this time England did not think it right to spoil relations with Germany, because he would have been left alone
 isi uddeshy kii purti ke liye usne germany se achche sambandh sthapit karne kaa praytn kiya
 Agreements between the two countries were also made with respect to Africa in 1898 AD and regarding armies in 1899 AD
 usee varsh england ke upnivesh mantri joseph chemberlen ne england, germany or sanyukt rajya ke ek trigut ke nirmaan kaa prastaav kiya, kintu 1899 i
 main bulo ne jo is samay germany kaa pradhanmantri tha, is prastaav ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 The reason for his rejection of this proposal was that it meant England to take the side of Germany in the ensuing wars and take part in the war as its supporter, and England settled from the European continent in Asia and Africa
 The empire continued to expand
 bulo kaa yah vichaar tha ki germany kii aupniveshik, vyapaarik tathaa navik unnati se england ko asuvidha hona anivaary thi or kabhi bhi donon main yuddh chhid saktaa he
 Therefore, it was well understood by the policies of Germany that over-trusting Germany would prove fatal for England and indeed a day would come when England and Germany would go to war
 france or rus ke madhya mitrataa kii sthapana ho chuki thi, ab france dwaara rus or england kii mitrataa kaa kaary aarambh hua
 In 1907, with the efforts of France, the faction of Russia and England became ready
 yah gut rakshaatmak tha kintu german samraat wiliam dwitiya ko iske nirmaan se badi chintaa hui
 Now he particularly attracted his attention towards the end of this group
 isi samay germany ko purvi samasya main hastkshep karne tathaa rus ko apamaanit karne kaa avasar praapt hua
 1908 AD There was a movement in Turkey which is known as the Young Turk Movement
 sheeghra hi austria ne bosnia tathaa harjegovina adhikaar kar liya
 Serbia could not bear it and started preparing for war
 usko yah aashaa thi ki austria tathaa germany ke viruddh rus or england uski sahaayta karne kii udyat ho jaayenge kintu rus kii abhi aisi sthiti nahin thi
 Austria dealt with Serbia very harshly, which made the war seem inevitable, but when Germany made a clear declaration that if Russia would help Serbia in any way, it would be able to fully support Austria in the war
 is ready
 is prakaar yuddh tal gaya
 At this time, Russia did not have the power to successfully counter the combined services of Germany and Austria
 rus ko baadhya hokar dab janaa padaa or german raajnneeti balkan prayadweep main safal hui
 Although the german-emperor William Kaiser succeeded in demoralizing Russia in the Balkan region and was able to expand the power and influence of his friend Austria, he remained fearful of the factions of France, Russia and England
 usne france or rus se mitrataa karne kii ore haath badhanaa aarambh kiya
 On 8 February 1909, he entered into an agreement with France, according to which France accepted the principle of independence and integrity of Morocco
