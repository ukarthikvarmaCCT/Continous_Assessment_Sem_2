 Pranayama is one of the eight organs of yoga
 pranayam = praan + aayam
 It literally means 'to prolong life' or 'to prolong life'
 hathyogpradipika main kaha gaya he- It is also said- pranayam do shabdon ke yoga se bana he- pehla shabd "praan" he doosraa "aayam"
 The meaning of Prana which gives us strength or strength
 aayam kaa arth jaanane ke liye iskaa sandhi viched karnaa hoga kyonki yah do shabdon ke yoga se bana he
 It has the root word "yam" and "A" prefix
 yam kaa arth 'gaman hota he or '"aa" ' upsarg 'ulataa ' ke arth main prayog kiya gaya he arthath aayam kaa arth ulataa gaman hota he
 Therefore, in Pranayama, the dimension has been used in the sense of 'inverse movement'
 is prakaar pranayam kaa arth 'praan kaa ulataa gaman hota he
 It is to be noted here that pranayama is the noun of the particular action of movement, not the result
 arthath pranayam shabd se praan ke vishesh kriya kaa bodh hona chaiye
 Many sages have said about Pranayama in their own way but all have the same feeling like Pranayajam Sutra of Patanjali and Pranayam Sutra of Gitanjali in which Pranayam Sutra is considered important which is as follows- Tasmin sati breathing breathing belief Its Hindi translation will be like this- Pranayama is the separation of the speed of breathing
 is sutara ke anusaar pranayam karne ke liye sabase pehle sutara kii samyak vyakhya honi chaiye lekin patanjali ke pranayam sutara kii vyakhya karne se pehle hame is baat kaa dhyaan dena chaiye ki patanjali ne yoga kii kriyaaon evam upaayen ko yogasutra naamak pustak main sutara rup se sankalit kiya he or sutara kaa arth hi hota he -ek nishchit niyam jo ganitiya evam vigyaan sammat ho
 If the formula is not explained correctly, the answer is far from true and the result will be zero
 yadi patanjali ke pranayam sutara ke anusaar pranayam karnaa he to sabase pehle unke pranayam sutara tasmin sati shwasaprashwasayorgativiched:pranayam
 kii samyak vyakhya honi chaiye jo shastranusaar, vigyaan sammat, taarkik, evam ganitiya ho
 Action has to be done according to this interpretation
 iske liye sutara main prayukt shabdon kaa arthbodh hona chaiye tathaa usamen di gayi gati viched kii vishesh yukti ko jaananaa hoga
 For this, the words used in the Pranayama Sutra of Patanjali should be understood
 shwaas ko dhimi gati se gahari khinchakar rokna va baahar nikaalnaa pranayam ke kram main aata he
 With breathing, feel that the life force, superiority is being drawn in by breathing, while exhaling feel that our bad, vicious feelings, bad thoughts are coming out with exasperation

 Population genetics focuses on the genetic design of populations and the study of how this pattern changes over time
 jansankhya jeevon kaa ek aisa samucchy hoti he, jisamen sadasyon kaa koi bhi samooh aapas main santanotpatti kar saktaa he
 It is implied that all members belong to the same species and live close to each other
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi jangal main rahane vaale ek hi prajati ke sabhi patange ek jansankhya hai
 a gene present in this population may have different alternative forms, which illustrate variations among organisms' phenotypes
 iskaa ek udhaaharan patangon main rang ke nirdhaaran ke liye uttaradaayi ek jin ho saktaa he, jisamen do yugma-vikalpi hote hai: kaala or safed
 kisi ekal jansankhya main ek jin ke liye yugma vikalpiyon kaa sampurna samucchya ek jin-pool kehalaata he; kisi yugma vikalpi ke liye yugma vikalpi aavriti us pool ke jeenon kaa vah bhaag hoti he, jo us yugma vikalpi se milakar bane hon 
 sankaran jeevon kii ek jansankhya ke antargat yugma vikalpiyon kii aavritiyon main parivartan hone par vikaas hota he; udhaaharan ke liye, patangon kii ek jansankhya main kaale rang ke liye uttaradaayi yugma vikalpi adhik aam hota ja rahaa he
 In order to understand the methodology that causes the growth of a population, it is useful to consider what conditions are necessary for the development of a population
 hardi-vinberg siddhant ke anusaar ek paryaapt rup se badi jansankhya main yugma-vikalpiyon kii aavriti sthir bani rahegi, yadi veery yaa andon ke nirmaan ke dauraan yugma-vikalpiyon kii yadrichhik adla-badali, tathaa nishechan ke dauraan in ling koshikaon main un yugma-vikalpiyon kaa yadrichhik sangyojan hi us jansankhya par kaary kar rahi ekmaatr shakti ho
 Such a population is considered to be in the Hardy – Weinberg equivalent because it is not developing
 hardi-vinberg siddhant ke anusaar kisi jansankhya main yugma-vikalpi or genotip aavritiyaan, donon hi peedi-dar-peedi sthir bane rahete hai—arthath ve samatulyata kii sthiti main hote hai—jab tak ki vyavdhaan utpann karne vaale koi vishisht prabhaav inke sampark main na aaen
 prayogshaala ke baahar, in “vyavdhaan utpann karanevaale prabhaavon” main se ek yaa adhik sadaiv prabhavi hote hai
 Hardy Weinberg equivalents are impossible in nature
 anuvaanshik samatulyata vah adarsh sthiti he, jo ek aadhaar-rekha pradaan karti he, jis par anuvaanshik parivartan ko mapa ja sake
 The frequencies of pair-choices in a population remain constant for generations if the following conditions are being observed: random cohabitation, no mutation, no migration or emigration, the sheer size of the population and any symptoms No selective pressure in support or opposition
 do yugma-vikalpiyon vaali kisi ekal jin avasthiti ke saralatam maamle main: prabhaavshaalee yugma-vikalpi ko a dwaara tathaa aprabhavi yugma-vikalpi ko a dwaara suchit kiya jaataa he or unki aavritiyaan p or q dwaara darshai jaati hai; freq = p ; freq = q ; p + q = 1
 yadi jansankhya samatulyata main ho, to hamen jansankhya main AA samayugmakon ke liye freq = p 2, aa samayugmakon ke liye freq = q 2, tathaa vishamyugmakon ke liye freq = 2pq praapt hogi
 Based on these equations, useful, but difficult-to-measure facts about a population can be determined
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek marij kii santan us aprabhavi utparivartan kii vaahak hoti he, jo samayugmak aprabhavi bacchon main sistic fibrosis kaa kaaran banataa he

 Template: Genetic genealogy jansankhya anuvanshiki ke ganit kaa vikaas multah aadhunik vikasmoolak sanshleshan ke ek bhaag ke rup main hua tha
 According to Betty, it defines the core of modern synthesis
 levontin ke anusaar, jansankhya anuvanshiki kaa saidhantik kaary do antaraalon kii ek prakriya he: ek "genotypic antaraal " or ek "phenotypic antaraal "
 jansankhya anuvanshiki ke ek purna siddhant kii chunauti niyamon kaa ek aisa samucchy pradaan karnaa he, jo genotip vaali ek jansankhya kaa milan phenotip, jahaan chayan kiya jaataa he, ke saath purvanumey rup se kar sake or niyamon ek anya samucchy, jo parinamit jansankhya kaa milan punah genotip ke saath kar sake, jahaan mendeleey anuvanshiki ke dwaara genotipon kii agali peedi kaa purvanumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he or is tarah chakra puraa ho jaataa he
 For a moment, if we put aside the non-mendelian aspects of molecular genetics, it is clearly a huge task
 is roopantaran ko yojanabaddh rup se dekhne par: Adapted from 1974, page + 12)
 Xd t 1 anuvaanshik or epigenetic niyamon, kaaryaatmak jeevigyaan ke pahaluon, yaa vikaas kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jo ek genotip ko phenotip main roopantarit karte hai
 We will refer to this as a "genotype-phenotype map"
 t 2 prakritik chayan ke kaaran hone vaala roopantaran he, t 3 epigenetic sambandh hai, jo chaynit phenotip ke aadhaar par genotip kaa purvanumaan lagaate hai or antat t 4 mendeleey anuvanshiki ke niyam hai
 In practice, evolutionary theory has two parts, which are parallel to each other, the traditional population genetics employed in the genotype interval and the biometric theory used in breeding of flora and animals, employed in the phenotype interval
 yahaan genotip or phenotip antaraal ke bich kaa maanchitran anupasthit he
 The reason for this is "sleight of hand", whereby variable objects of a region are considered to be criteria or stationary objects, where, in a complete practice, they will be transformed automatically by evolutionary processes and in reality they are transformed into another area
 There are actions that change the state of is "haath kii safai" main yah mana jaataa he ki ham is maanchitran ko jaanate hai
 To assume that we understand this is sufficient to analyze many matters of interest to us
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi phenotip genotip ke saath lagbhag ek-prati-ek ho yaa samay-maap paryaapt rup se sankshipt ho, to "sthir vastuon" ko usee rup main sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he, jis rup main ve maujuud hon; haalanki, anek sthitiyon main aisa karnaa galat bhi hota he
 Natural selection is the process by which hereditary traits that increase the chances of survival and successful reproduction of an organism become more common in subsequent generations of a population
 jeevon kii ek jansankhya ke bheetar prakritik anuvaanshik vividhta kaa arth yah he ki vartmaan vaataavaran main kuch jeev anya jeevon kii tulana main adhik safaltaapurvak jivit bache rahenge yah mudda charles darwin ne langik chayan ke apane vichaaron main viksit kiya ki prajananaatmak safalataa ko prabhavit karne vaale kaarak bhi mahatvapurn hai
 Natural selection works on the phenotype, or on the observable traits of the organism, but the genetic basis of any phenotype, which provides the advantage of reproduction, will become more common in a population
 Over time, this process can result in adaptations to a specific ecological habitat and eventually result in the birth of a new species
 prakritik chayan aadhunik jeev-vigyaan kii aadharshilaon main se ek he
 This new vocabulary was introduced by Charles Darwin in his 1859 unprecedented book On the Origin of Species, which describes natural selection as artificial selection, a process by which animals and flora are systematically introduced to reproduction by traits desired by their human breeders
 Supported by, it was compared with
 multah prakritik chayan kii avadharana kaa vikaas anuvaanshikta ke ek maanya siddhant ke abhaav main hua tha; darwin ke lekhan ke samay, aadhunik anuvanshiki vigyaan ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 Modern developmental synthesis is called the mutual combination of discoveries made in Darwinian development and subsequent traditional and molecular genetics
 prakritik chayan anukoolnaatmak vikaas kaa mukhya kaaran bana hua he
 Genetic fallacy is the difference in relative frequency in which another form of a gene arises in a population due to random sampling and opportunity
 arthath, jansankhya main aane vaali pidiyon main upasthit yugma-vikalpi inke abhibhavakon main upasthit yugma-vikalpiyon ke ek yadrichhik sample hote hai
 And opportunity plays a role in determining whether a particular organism will survive and breed
 ek jansankhya kii yugma-vikalpi aavriti kisi vishisht rup ko saajha karne vaale jin yugma-vikalpiyon kii kul sankhya kii tulana main isaki jin pratiyon kaa bhaag yaa pratishat hota he
 Genetic bending is an important developmental process, resulting in changes in pair-alternating frequencies over time
 iske kaaran jin kii koi vividhta purnatah samaapt bhi ho sakati he, jisase anuvaanshik parivartanshiltaa main kami aati he
 In contrast to natural selection, which makes diverse forms of genes more common or less common depending on their success in reproduction, the changes due to genetic predation are not driven by environmental or adaptation pressures, and they tend towards reproductive success
 Can also be profitable, neutral or harmful
 anuvaanshik jhukaav kaa prabhaav choti jansankhya main bada or badi jansankhya main chota hota he
 There is a strong debate among scientists about the importance of genetic predisposition compared to natural selection
 ronaald fisher kaa drushtikon yah he ki anuvaanshik jhukaav vikaas main ek naganya bhoomika nibhaataa he or yahi drushtikon kai dashakon tak prabhavi rahaa he
 In 1968, Motu Kimura revived this debate by the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, which claimed that most changes in genetic material are caused by genetic orientations
 utparivartan ek koshika ke jinom ke diene kram main hone vaale parivartan hai or ye vikiran, vishaanuon, transposon or utparivartak rasayanon tathaa saath hi miyosis yaa diene pratilipikaran ke dauraan utpann hone vaali trutiyon ke kaaran hote hai
 Errors often occur during the process of DNA replication, in the polymerization of other fibers
 ye trutiyaan swayan jeev dwaara bhi ati-utparivartan jaisi koshikeey prakriyaaon dwaara utpann kii ja saktin hai
 Mutations can have an effect on the phenotype of an organism, particularly if they are generated within the protein coding sequence of a gene
 diene polimrez kii “prufreeding” kshamta ke kaaran trutiyon kii dar saamanytah bahut kam hoti he
 Without proofreading, the rates of errors are a thousand times higher than this
 diene main hone vaali rasinic kshati prakritik rup se bhi hoti he or koshikaayen diene main is tuutan or galat milaanon ko sudhaarney ke liye diene sudhaar kaarividhi kaa prayog karti he
 Despite this, sometimes this correction fails to return the DNA to its original sequence
 diene kii adla-badali karne or jeenon ko punah sanyojit karne ke liye gunasutreey badlaav kaa prayog karne vaale jeevon main, miyosis ke dauraan sanrekhan main hone vaali trutiyon ke kaaran bhi utparivartan ho sakate hai
 Errors in change are most likely to occur when similar sequences force their participatory properties to adopt a misalignment; This causes certain regions of the genome to become more susceptible to such mutations
 ye trutiyaan diene kram main bade sanrachanaatmak badlaav utpann karti hai—sampurna kshetra kaa doharaav, utkraman yaa vilopan, athwa vibhinn gun-sutron ke bich puure bhaagon kii galati se adla-badali ho janaa 
 Mutations can cause many different types of changes in the DNA sequence; It is possible that they have no effect, or that they change the product of a gene or that it stops the gene from functioning
 drosophila melanogaster naamak makkhi par kiye gayi adhyayan main yah gyaat hua ki yadi koi utparivartan ek jin dwaara utpann kisi protein ko parivartit karata he, to sambhawatah yah hanikaarak hoga kyonki is utparivartan ke lagbhag 70 pratishat bhaag kaa prabhaav hanikaarak hoga or shesh bhaag yaa to tatasth hoga athwa bahut hi kam laabhadaayak hoga
 Due to the potentially harmful effects of these mutations on cells, organisms have developed procedures such as DNA correction to remove the mutations
 atah prajatiyon ke bich utparivartan kii ishtatam dar ucch utparivartan dar, jaise kshatikar utparivartan, kii laagton or utparivartan dar ko kam karne ke liye pranaaliyon, jaise diene sudhaar kinvakon, ke rakh-rakhaav kii chayapachayee laagton ke bich hoti he
 Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have high mutation rates, which may be of benefit as these viruses will evolve continuously and rapidly and thus evade the protective response of the human immune system, for example
 
 utparivartan main diene ke bade bhaagon kaa doharaav shaamil ho saktaa he, jo ki saamanytah anuvaanshik punarsangyojan ke madhyam se hota he
 These repeats are a major source of raw material for the creation of new genes and tens to hundreds of genes are transcribed into the animal genome every million years
 adhikansh jin saajha vansh ke jeenon ke bade pariwaron ke sadsy hote hai
 New genes are produced by various methods, usually through duplication and mutation of an ancestral gene, or by creating new combinations that perform new functions by recombining parts of different genes
 yahaan, kshetra khandon ke rup main kaary karte hai, jinamein se prayek kaa ek vishisht or swatantra kaary hota he or jinhen aapas main milakar naye gunon ke saath naye protein ko kutabaddh karne vaale jin utpann kiye ja sakate hai
 For example, the human eye uses four genes to construct a structure that recognizes light : three for color vision and one for night vision; These four originate from the same ancestor gene
 ek jin kii pratilipi banane kaa ek anya laabh yah he ki isse atirek badhata he; yah yugma ke ek jin ko naye kaary ko apnaane kii anumati detaa he, jabaki anya pratilipi mul kaary jari rakhti he
 Other types of mutation often create new genes from previously untreated DNA
 jin pravaah jansankhyaon, jo ki aksar samaan prajatiyaan hotin hai, ke bich jeenon kii adla-badali he
 Examples of gene flow between similar species include migration of organisms and subsequent breeding, or interchange of pollen
 prajatiyon ke bich jin sthanantaran main sankar jeevon kaa nirmaan or kshaitij jin sthanantaran shaamil hai
 Migration within or outside the population may change the frequency of pair-choices and also introduce new genetic variations in the population
 apravasana kisi jansankhya ke jin pool main naye anuvaanshik padaarth jod saktaa he
 Emigration by contrast can remove genetic material
 chunki jansankhyaon kii nai prajatiyon ke nirmaan ke liye do chhitari hui jansankhyaon ke bich prajnan ke prati avarodhon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jin pravaah jansankhyaon ke bich anuvaanshik antar failaakar is prakriya ko dhimaa kar saktaa he
 Mountain-chains, oceans and deserts or even man-made structures, such as the Great Wall of China, which inhibited the flow of genes of vegetation, inhibit gene flow
 is aadhaar par ki do prajatiyaan apane sabase haalia aam purvaj se kitni dur hat gayi hai, apni santan utpann karnaa unke liye abhi bhi sambhav ho saktaa he, jaise ghodon or gadhon ke bich prajnan se khachchar utpann hote hai
 Generally such hybrid organisms are infertile because two different sets of properties are not able to form pairs during meiosis
 In this case, closely related species may hybridize regularly, but hybrids will be selected to the contrary and the species will remain distinct
 However, sometimes hybrid hybrids are also produced, and these new species have intermediate properties to their parent species, or they have completely new phenotypes
 pashuon kii nai prajatiyon ke nirmaan main sankaran kaa mahatv aspasht he, haalanki, iske maamle anek prakaar ke pashuon main dekhe jate rahe hai, or grey tree mendhak iskaa ek vishisht udhaaharan he, jiskaa bahut acchhee tarah adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Hybridization is, however, an important means of characterization in flora, as polyploidy is more accepted by flora than animals
 poliploidi sankaranon main mahatvapurn he kyonki yah aise prajnan kii anumati detaa he, jisamen miyosis ke dauraan gunasutron ke do bhinn samucchyon main se prayek ek samroop sahabhaagi ke saath jodi banane main sakasham hota he
 Polyploid organisms also have greater genetic diversity, due to which they can survive the pressure of interbreeding in small populations
 kshaitij jin sthanantaran ek jeev se kisi duusare aise jeev main anuvaanshik saamagree kaa sthanantaran he, jo uski santan na ho; yah jeevanuon main sabase aam he
 In medicine, it contributes to the expansion of resistance to antibiotics because when a bacterium acquires resistant genes, it can rapidly transfer them to another species
 jeevanuon se eukeriot jeevon, jaise khamir seceromices serevisi or aazuki been bhanvare calosobrukas chinensis tak jeenon kaa kshaitij sthanantaran bhi hua hoga
 An example of large-scale transfers is the eukaryotic dalloid rotifer, which probably inherited a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and flora
 vishaanu bhi jeevon ke bich diene le ja sakate hai, jisase jaivik kshetron ke bich bhi jeenon kaa sthanantaran hota he
 Large-scale gene transfer can also occur between eukaryotic cells and prokaryote organisms during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria
 ek jansankhya se duusari main yugma-vikalpiyon ke sthanantaran ko jin pravaah kehete hai
 Migration within or outside a single population may be responsible for a characteristic change in allele frequencies
 apravasana ke parinamswaroop bhi kisi vishisht prajati yaa jansankhya ke sthapit jin pool main naye anuvaanshik bhinn-rup jud sakate hai
 There are several factors affecting the rate of gene flow between different populations
 sarvaadhik mahatvapurn karkon main se ek he gatishiltaa, kyonki jeev kii gatishiltaa jitani adhik hogi, uski pravaasana sambhaavna bhi utani hi adhik hogi
 The mobility of animals is greater than that of vegetation, although pollen and animals can be carried for very long distances by animals or by air
 do jansankhyaon ke bich anurakshit jin pravaah ke kaaran bhi do jin pulon kaa sangyojan ho saktaa he, jisase do samoohon ke bich anuvaanshik vividhta main kami aati he
 This is why gene flow acts strongly against recombination by recombining the gene pools of these clusters and thus developing differences in genetic diversity, which would have resulted in complete differentiation and female species formation
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ghaas kii ek prajati kisi sadak-maarg ke donon ore viksit ho jaati he, to is baat kaa sambhaavna he ki paraag-kan ek se duusari ore yaa isaki vipareet disha main sthanantarit honge
 If this pollen is able to fertilize the plant at its destination and produce a viable progeny, then that pollen-particle is effectively able to migrate from one side of the population on one side of the road to the other

 In a series of his papers, beginning in 1918 and ending with his 1930 book The Genetic Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher demonstrated that differences measured continuously by biometrics resulted from the combined function of several discrete genes

 In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic predation and interbreeding could overcome a small, segregated subpopulation from a customizable high-point, allowing natural selection to make it There is an opportunity to lead to various customizable high-points

 The 18th cavalry tanks of the Indian Army on Pakistani posts took charge during the 1965 war
 a second confrontation with Pakistan took place largely in 1965 in Kashmir
 Pakistani President Ayub Khan started Operation Gibraltar in August 1965, during which several Pakistani paramilitary troops tried to infiltrate Indian-administered Kashmir and spark an anti-india insurgency
 Pakistani leaders believe that India, which was still recovering from the disastrous war india-china, would be unable to deal with a military thrust and rebellion
 However, the operation was a major failure since the Kashmiri people showed little support for such an insurgency and India quickly moved forces to drive out the intruders
 Within a fortnight of the launch of the Indian counter-attack, most of the intruders had retreated to Pakistan

 According to Skanda Purana, Lord Shiva said that a devotee who will bring Ganga water from Haridwar by placing it on the shoulder of Kavad and offer it here, will get salvation

 As a result, the velocity of light moving in the direction of this velocity increases slightly and the velocity of light moving in the opposite direction decreases

 Konark Surya Mandir is revered in the city of Puri under Puri district of the state of Orissa in India
 yah bharatvarsh ke chuninda surya mandiron main se ek he
 In 1984, UNESCO has recognized it as a World Heritage Site
 yah mandir surya-dev arthath arq ko samarpit tha, jinhen sthaneey log biranchi-narayan kehete the
 For this reason, this region was called ark-kshetra or padma-kshetra
 puraanon ke anusaar shrikrishna ke putr samb ko unke shraap se kodh rog ho gaya tha
 Samb did penance for twelve years in Konark at the ocean confluence of the Chandrabhaga river at Mitravan and pleased the Sun God
 suryadev, jo sabhi rogon ke naashak the, ne iske rog kaa bhi nivaaran kar diya tha
 Accordingly, Samb decided to build a temple of the Sun God
 apane rog-naash ke uparaant, chandrabhaga nadi main snaan karte hue, use suryadev kii ek murti mili
 This idol was made by Devashilpi Sri Vishwakarma from the same part of Suryadev's body
 samb ne apane banawaaye mithravan main ek mandir main, is murti ko sthapit kiya, tab se yah sthaan pavitra mana jane laga
 It is the opinion of many historians that due to the premature death of King Langul Narsinghdeva, the builder of the Konark temple, the construction work of the temple fell into disrepair
 iske parinamswaroop, adhuraa dhaancha dhwast ho gaya
 But this view is not supported by historical figures
 puri ke madal panji ke aankadon ke anusaar or kuch 1278 i
 ke tamrapatron se pataa chalaa, ki raja langool nrisinghdev ne 1282 tak shashan kiya
 Many historians are also of the opinion that the Konark temple was built between 1253 to 1260 AD
 atev mandir ke apurna nirmaan kaa iske dhwast hone kaa kaaran hona tarksangat nahin he
 It is no less than a complex task to mention the entire reasons for the demolition of the temple here
 parantu yah sarvavidit he ki ab iskaa kaaphi bhaag dhwast ho chukaa he
 The main reason for this is also called Vastu Dosh, but the role of Muslim invasions has been important
 kaha jaataa he ki yah mandir apane vaastu dosha ke kaaran maatr 800 varshon main ksheen ho gaya tha
 Which is heard and heard against Vastu art and rules
 isi karanvash yah apni samyavadhi se pehle hi rugavedakaal evam pashaan kala kaa anupam udhaaharan hote hue bhi dharashayi ho gaya
 The main architectural defects of this Sun-temple are: -
 kai kathaon ke anusaar, surya mandir ke shikhar par ek chumbakeey pathar laga he
 As a result of this, the ocean ships passing through the sea of konark are drawn towards this, causing heavy damage to them
 anya katha anusaar, is pathar ke kaaran poton ke chumbakeey disha nirupan yantra sahi disha nahin bataate
 For this reason, Muslim sailors took out this stone to save their grandsons
 yah pathar ek kendriya shila kaa kaary kar rahaa tha, jisase mandir kii deevaaron ke sabhi pathar santulan main the
 Due to its removal, the balance of the temple walls was lost and as a result they collapsed
 parantu is ghatana kaa koi aitihaasik vivaran nahin miltaa, naa hi aise kisi chumbakeey kendriya pathar ke astitv kaa koi byora uplabdh he
 a very important theory related to the fall of Konark temple is associated with Kalapahad
 urisa ke itihaas ke anusaar kalapahaad ne san 1508 main yahaan akraman kiya or konark mandir samet urisa ke kai hindu mandir dhwast kar diye
 Madan Panji of the Jagannath temple in Puri tells how Kalapahar attacked Orissa
 konark mandir sahit usne adhikansh hindu mandiron kii pratimaayein bhi dhwast kareen
 Although it was impossible to break the 20-25 feet thick walls of the Konark temple, he somehow managed to shake Dadhinauti, which caused the temple to collapse
 dadhinauti ke hatane ke kaaran hi mandir dhire-dhire girane laga tathaa chat se baari pathar girane se, mukashaala kii chat bhi dhwast ho gayi
 He also demolished most of the sculptures here and many other temples in Konark
 san 1568 main urisa main muslimon kaa aatank niyantran main ho chukaa tha
 But even after this, there were continuous efforts to break the Hindu temples
 is samay puri ke jagannatha mandir ke pandon ne bhagwaan jagannatha ji kii murti ko shrimandir se hataakar kisi gupt sthaan par chupa diya tha
 Similarly, the pandas of the Sun Temple of Konark removed the idol of the presiding deity and kept it hidden in the sand for years
 baad main, yah murti puri bhej di gayi or vahaan jagannatha mandir ke praangan main sthit, indra ke mandir main rakh di gayi
 According to others, the worship idols here are still to be discovered
 lekin kai logon kaa kahana he, ki surya dev kii murti, jo nai dilli ke rashtriya sangrahalay main rakhi he, vahi konark kii pradhan poojya murti he
 Yet in Konark, Surya Vandana ceased after the removal of the idol from the temple
 is kaaran konark main tirthayatriyon kaa aana janaa band ho gaya
 Konark's port also closed due to bandits attack
 konark surya vandana ke samaan hi vanijyik gatividhiyon hetu bhi ek kirtivan nagar tha, parantu in gatividhiyon ke band ho jane ke kaaran, yah ekadam nirvasit ho chalaa or varshon tak ek gahan jangal se dhank gaya
 In 1626, the king of Khurda, Narasimha Dev, son Shri Purushottam Dev, took the idol of Suryadev to Puri along with two other statues of Surya and Chandra
 ab ve puri ke mandir ke praangan main milti hai
 It is known from the history of the Madal Register of Puri that in 1028, King Naseenhadeva ordered the measurement of all the temples of Konark
 maapan ke samay, surya mandir apni amalak shila tak astitv main tha, yani ki lagbhag 200 feet ooncha
 Kalapahad destroyed not only its urn, but also the padma-dhwaja, kamal-kirit and the upper part
 pehle bataaye anusaar, mukhshala ke saamne, ek bada prastar khand – navagraha paat, hota tha
 The then king of Khurda removed that block, as well as took a number of sculpted stones from Konark
 or puri ke mandir ke nirmaan main unka prayog kiya tha
 In the Maratha period, Konark stones were used in the construction of the boundary wall of the temple of Puri
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he, ki nat mandir ke sabhi bhaag, sabase lambe kaal tak, apni mul avasthaa main rahe hai
 And in the Maratha period, they were deliberately broken as an unusable part
 san 1779 main ek maratha sadhu ne konark ke arun stambh ko hataa kar puri ke singhdwar ke saamne sthapit karvaa diya
 By the end of the eighteenth century, Konark lost all its glory and turned into a forest
 iske saath hi mandir kaa kshetra bhi jangal ban gaya, jahaan junglee jaanavar or daakuon ke adde the
 The locals here were also afraid to go till daylight
 konark shabd, 'kone' or 'arq' shabdon ke mail se bana he
 The meaning of the extract is sun while the angle must have been from the corner or edge
 prastut konark surya-mandir kaa nirmaan laal rang ke balua pattharon tathaa kaale grenite ke pattharon se hua he
 It was built in 1236–1264 BC by the erstwhile feudal king of Ganga Dynasty, Narasimhadeva
 yah mandir, bharat ke sabase prasiddh sthalon main se ek he
 It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984
 kaling style main nirmit is mandir main surya dev ko rath ke rup main virajman kiya gaya he tathaa pattharon ko utkrisht nakkashi ke saath ukera gaya he
 The entire temple site has been constructed with twelve pair of chakras pulled by seven horses, in which the sun god is shown seated
 parantu vartmaan main saaton main se ek hi ghoda bachaa hua he
 These twelve chakras define the twelve months of the year, giving beauty to the base of the temple and each chakra is made up of eight arrows, which represent the eight wheels of the day
 yahaan par sthaneey log prastut surya-bhagwaan ko biranchi-narayan kehete the
 The main temple is built in three pavilions
 inamen se do mandap dhah chuke hai
 In the third pavilion where the idol was, the British had filled the sand and stones before the Indian independence, and closed all the gates permanently so that the temple could not be damaged
 is mandir main surya bhagwaan kii teen pratimaayein hai: On its entry, two lions are shown to be aggressive in defense of elephants
 yah sambhavtah tatkaaleen brahman rupi singhon kaa buddha rupi haathiyon par varchasv kaa pratik he

9 feet wide and 9
2 feet high by 28 tons

 There is a Nat temple at its entrance
 ye vah sthaan he, jahaan mandir kii nartakiyaan, suryadev ko arpan karne ke liye nrity kiya karatin thim
 The entire temple has carvings of flowers and geometric patterns
 inke saath hi maanav, dev, gandharva, kinnar aadi kii akrutiyaan bhi andrik mudraon main darshit hai
 His postures are sensual and derived from Kamasutra
 mandir ab anshik rup se khandhar main parivartit ho chukaa he

 The main Sun Temple of the thirteenth century is built in the form of a great chariot, with twelve pairs of wheels, drawn by seven horses

 The architectural proportions here are devoid of defects and surprising dimensions
 yahaan kii sthapatyakala vaibhav evam maanviya nishtha kaa sauhardpurn sangam he
 Each inch of the temple is replete with unique beauty and artefacts of grace
 iske vishay bhi mohak hai, jo sahasron shilp akritiyaan bhagavaanon, devataaon, gandharvon, maanvon, vaadyakon, premi yugalon, darbar kii chhaviyon, shikaar evam yuddh ke chitron se bhari hai
 Among them are elaborate animals and birds and mythological creatures, besides fine and intricate bells and geometric patterns

 The subject of these figures is shown in clear but very tenderness and rhythm
 jivan kaa yahi drushtikon, konark ke anya sabhi shilp nirmaanon main bhi dikhaai detaa he
 Thousands of human, animal and divine people are seen working in this life-like fair, in which there is a confluence of realism

 Its exquisite craftsmanship, carvings, and accurate display of animal and human figures prove it far superior to other temples
 yah surya mandir bhartiya mandiron kii kaling style kaa he, jisamen koniya attalika ke upar mandap kii tarah chhatari dhaki hoti he
 In shape, this temple does not seem to be much different from other Shikhar temples in Orissa
 229 feet ooncha mukhya garbhagrih 128 feet oonchi naatyashaala ke saath hi bana he
 It has many figures protruding from outside
 mukhya garbh main pradhan devtaa kaa vaas tha, kintu vah ab dhwast ho chukaa he
 The theater is still full

 The main courtyard of the temple is 857 feet x 540 feet
 yah mandir purv –pashchim disha main bana he
 The temple is surrounded by natural greenery

 ek katha ke anusaar, gang vansh ke raja nrisingh dev pratham ne apane vansh kaa varchasv siddh karne hetu, rajasi ghoshnaa se mandir nirmaan kaa aadesh diya
 The army of twelve hundred architects and artisans built it with twelve years of tireless work with their creative talent and full of energy
 raja ne pehle hi apane rajya ke baarah varshon kii kar-prapti ke baraabar dhan vyay kar diya tha
 But the completeness of the construction was nowhere to be seen
 tab raja ne ek nishchit tithi tak kaary purna karne kaa kadaa aadesh diya
 Under the supervision of Bisu Maharana, this team of architects had already put all their skills
 tab bisu maharana kaa baarah varshiya putr, dharm paad aage aayaa
 He thoroughly inspected the construction till then, although he did not have practical knowledge of temple construction, he had studied the scriptures of temple architecture thoroughly
