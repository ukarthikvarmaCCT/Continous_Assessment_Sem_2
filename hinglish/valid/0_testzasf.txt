 Stephanie Meyer's extravagant romance novel Twilight was originally titled in April 2004 by Paramount Pictures' MTV Films, but the later developed screenplay was significantly different from its source material
 jab april, 2007 main summit antertenment ne khud ko ek ful-sarvice studio ke rup main punah gadha, to isane ek prativartan main paramount se adhikaar lene ke baad filmi roopantaran ke vikaas ko nae sire se shuru kiya
 Based on the success of Meyer's book and his later works, the company was looking at the film as an opportunity to launch Privilege
 us garmiyon main, catherine hardvik ko film nirdeshit karne or melisa rocenberg ko patakatha likhane ke kaam par rakhaa gaya
 By the end of August, Rosenberg developed an outline and collaborated with Hardwick for scriptwriting during the following month
 " ek prabhaavshaalee thamaapi thi or sabhi prakaar ke shandaar vichaaron se las xxrep 4 
 main drishyon ko khatm karti or unhen uske paas bhej detii or uski tippaniyan waapas milteen
" asann WGA hadtaal ke kaaran, rocenberg ne 31 oktober se pehle patakatha khatm karne ke liye ful-time kaam kiya
 In transforming the novel, he "had to condense to a great extent
" Some characters in the novel were not featured in the screenplay, while some characters were combined into others
 "hamaara iraadaa yahi rahaa ki ham is qitaab ke saath eemaandaar rahen
" rocenberg ne vyakhya kii, "or iskaa lenaa-dena shabdashah roopantaran se kam or yah sunishchit karne se zyaada rahaa he ki paatro kaa chithran or unki bhaavnaatmak yatra samaan rahe
" mukhya paatr ke aantarik samvaad ke liye hardvik ne parshv swar kaa suzav diya- chunki upanyaas bela ke drushtikon se sunaaya gaya he - or nirmaan kii purv taiyaari ke dauraan usne kuch story-board sketch banaae
 When they told me Rob was probably the one, i looked him up and thought, "yeah, he can do a version of Edward
 He's definitely got that vampire thing going on
" And then, when i was on set and i got to watch him go from being Rob to shifting into being Edward, and he actually looked like the Edward in my head, it was a really bizarre experience
 He really had it nailed
 cristan stiwart adventure ke set par thim jab hardvik usase ek anaupchaarik screen test ke liye mili, jisane nirdeshak ko "mohit" kar diya
 Hardwick did not initially select Robert Pattinson for the role of Edward Cullen, but after an audition at his home with Stewart
 apane screen test se pehle patinson upanyaas shrinkhalaa se aparichit tha, lekin baad main usne qitabon ko padhaa
 meyer ne use adhure midnite san kii pandulipi dekhne kii anumati di, jo twilite ko edward ke nazariye se ghatnavar rakhata he
 Pattinson's selection as Edward initially received negative feedback from fans; Rachel Lefevre commented that "every woman imagined she had an Edward of her own who needed to leave, so that they could adopt her, which they did
" " do mukhya paatro ke chayan kii pratikriya main meyer "utsahit" or "aanandit" thim
 Prior to production, she had expressed interest in choosing Emily Browning and Henry Cavill as Bella and Edward, respectively
 carlisle kalan ke rup main multah peter fesinelli ko nahin chunaa gaya tha
 "liked, but there was another actor, whose name the studio was pushing
 " agyaat kaarnon se, vah kalakaar abhinay karne main aksham tha or fesinelli ko uske sthaan par chunaa gaya
 Ashley Greene's selection for Alice Cullen's character was somewhat criticized by fans, due to Greene being 7 inches taller than her character described in the novel
 Meyer also said that Rachel Le Cook is very similar to Alice in her imagination
 niki read isse pehle hardvik ke saath thartin, jise unhone sanyukt rup se likhaa tha or lords of dogtoon main kaam kar chuki thi
 "I don't want to say that it's a coincidence, because we do a good job together and our history is fantastic
 mujhe lagata he ki ham saath main acha kaam karte hai, lekin aksar aisa hota he ki jo log apni film nirdeshit karne kii peshkash karte hai, is baat kii sambhaavna zyaada he ki unhone uske anya kaam dekhen hon
 Kellan Lutz was busy filming hbo's short series Generation Kill in Africa when tests for Emmett Cullen's character were conducted
 disambar, 2007 main nirmaan khatm hone tak, bhoomika ke liye chayan ho chukaa tha, lekin jis abhinayta kaa chayan hua tha vah "peeche hat gaya"; uske tunrat baad lutz ne pareekshan diya or oregon pahunch gaya, jahaan hardvik ne vyaktigat taur par use chunaa
 Rachel Lefevre was interested in a role in the film, as Hardwick was associated with the project as a director and had "the ability to crawl a character, possibly, in three films" and she wanted to play a vampire
 " sochaa ki pishaach multah manushya kii chintaa or jivit hone ke prashnon ke bare main sabase achche roopak the

 After more than a week of rehearsals, principal photography took 44 days, and was completed on 2 May 2008
 apane pratham nirdeshkeey thartin ke samaan hi, film ko "yatharthamay" banane ke liye hardvik ne hast-dhaarit chalchitr-kala kaa vyapak upyog kiya
 Meyer visited the construction site three times and was consulted on various aspects of the story; He also has a brief role in the film
 jin paatro ne pishaach kii bhoomika nibhaai, unhone apni twachaa pili karne ke liye suraj kii roshni se parhez kiya, haalanki us prabhaav ke liye mek-ap bhi kiya gaya tha or contact lens pahana gaya tha: "hamane sunaharaa rang kiya, kyonki kalan kii sunahari ankhen thi
 And then, when we felt hungry, we had to plant black ones, "explained Fasinelli
 unhone ek nrity nirdeshak ke saath abhyaas main bhaag bhi liya or apni shaareerik gatividhiyon ko or adhik sundar banane ke liye, vibhinn penthra ke shaareerik gathan kaa nirikshan kiya
 Scenes were filmed primarily in Portland, Oregon
 stant kaary mukhya rup se kalakaaron dwaara kiye gaye
 The battle between the characters of Giganadette and Pattinson in a ballet studio, which was filmed in the first week of production, consisted largely of wire work, as the vampires in the story possessed supernatural powers and speed
 is kram main gigandett ne ladaai kii chaalon main kuch mishrit marshall art ko shaamil kiya, jisamen maance ke liye vikalp ke rup main murgi or shahad shaamil tha
 The main character, Bella, was unconscious during these events and since the novel is narrated from her point of view, such action sequences are explanatory and unique to the film
 patinson ne paaya ki taar ke kaary ke dauraan gurutvkarshan kaa centre banaae rakhana kathin he, "kyonki aapako sach main iske khilaaf ladanaa hota he or saath hi saath isko jo karne kii zarurat he, vah karne dena hota he
 Lefevre found this experience to be misleading, since forward movement is not under anyone's control
 forks hai skool main hi filmakan ke bajaay, skool main ghatit drishyon ko kalamaa hai skool or medisson hai skool main filmaaya gaya
 Other scenes were filmed in St
 Helens, Oregon, and Hardwick conducted some re-enactments in August in Pasadena, California
 It was the studio's intention to produce a series of at least three films based on Meyer's books, and by October 2008 the summit took over New Moon
 sanyukt rajya america ke cinema hollon main twilite kaa pradarshan multah 12 disambar 2008 ko hone vaala tha, lekin harry potter and da haaf-blad prince ke pradarshan ko july 2009 ke liye punarnirdhaarit kiye jane ke baad iskaa pradarshan dinaank, 21 navambar ko badal diya gaya
 Two teaser trailers, as well as some additional scenes, were released for the film, with the final trailer released on 9 October
 twilite kaa 15-minute kaa ek ansh italy main antarrashtriya rome film samaaroh ke dauraan pesh kiya gaya
 The film received a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America due to "some violence and a lustful scene"
 britain or ireland main ise 12A kaa darja diya gaya
 Twilight's vocals were composed by Carter Burwell, while the rest of the soundtrack was selected by music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas
 meyer se soundtrack par paraamarsh liya gaya tha, jisamen band mus or linkin park kaa sangeet shaamil hai, jinhen unhone upanyaas likhte vaqt suna tha
 The original soundtrack was released on November 4 by Chop Shop Records in conjunction with Atlantic Records
 22 november ke chart saptaah ke liye is soundtrack ne billboard 200 par pehle sthaan par shuruuaat kii
 The filmmakers of Twilight took on the task of producing a film that was as honest to the book as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, which producer Greg Moradian said, "it is very recognizable It is necessary that we are creating a separate work of art, which will obviously be very, very honest with the book xxrep 4 
 but at the same time, we are It is a different responsibility to make that best film
 ek eemaandaar roopantaran sunishchit karne ke liye, lekhak stiffeni meyer ko nirmaan prakriya main gaharaai se shaamil kiya gaya, jiske tahat unhen filmakan ke dauraan aamantrit kiya jaataa tha or yahaan tak ki kathanak or raf-cat par unase tippanee bhi maangi jaati thi
 Regarding this process, Meyer said, "it was a really pleasant exchange right from the beginning, which i think is not very common
 unhen vastav main mere vichaaron main ruchi thi," or," 


 unhone mujhe bhi centre main rakhaa or patakatha ke maamle main, ve mujhe use dekhne dete the or kehete,"aapke kya vichaar hai ?"


 ve mujhe is par tippaniyan dene dete the or mujhe lagata he ki unhone meraa kaha 90 pratishat tak grahan kiya or bas sidhe kathanak main shaamil kar liya
 "meyer, in particular, vied for one of the book's most known lines about" The Lion and the Lamb "to put her into the film literally:" i really think the way Melissa did it It is written that it is better for the film
 

 lekin samasya yah he ki yah pankti vastav main logon ke sharir par ankit tatu he
 

but i said, 'you know, if you take that one and change it, it's a possible setback situation
 '" meyer ko un chizon kii likhit suchi banane ke liye bhi aamantrit kiya gaya, jinhen vah film ke liye parivartit nahin karnaa chaahati thi, jaise pishaachon ke panje yaa un paatro ko maar dena, jo pustak main nahin marate hai or inhen maanane ke liye studio sahamat ho gaya
 The general consensus among critics is that the filmmaker was successful in making a film that is very sincere to its source material, where one reviewer stated that, with a few exceptions, "the film Twilight was paralyzed by the source, Has been unfailingly loyal to him
 They could have filmed and not called it Twilight because it had nothing to do with the book


 When Summit came into the picture, they were so open to letting us make rules for them, like "okay, Bella cannot be a track star
 Bella cannot have a gun or night vision goggles
 And, no jet skis xxrep 4 
 " However, as is often the case with film-adaptations of the book, differences exist between the film and the original source material
 pustak ke kuch drishy film se kaat die gaye, jaise jeev-vigyaan kaksh kaa ek drishy, jahaan bela kii kaksha rakt se tip karti he
 Hardwick explains, "is about 500 pages - and you have to make a sweetened-milk version
 

hamaare paas pehle se hi jeev-vigyaan main do drishy hai: pehali baar, ve vahiin maujuud hai or phir duusari baar, jab ve judate hai
 For a film, when you compress it, you don't want to go back to the same stage again and again, so it's not put there
 " qitaab main kuch sanvaadon kii manch-sajja ko bhi badla gaya, taaki kuch drishyon ko parade par "dekhne main adhik gatisheel" banaaya ja sake, jaise ki bela kaa ek ghaas ke maidan main yah kulasa karnaa ki vah edward ke pishaach hone kii baat vah jaanati he, jabaki upanyaas main yah drishy edward kii car main ghatit hota he
 a biology field trip scene is added to the film to summarize those moments of Bella's frustration, in which she tries to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by the van
 One of the biggest changes is the introduction of an evil vampire into the film much earlier, while the book does not, which Rosenberg describes as, "you really want James and the other villains at the end of the book's quarter Are able to see, which is not really going to work for a film
 You will need that wretched tension right away
 Let us give them and that imminent danger right from the beginning
 Not wanted
 or isliye mujhe paatro ke rup main unhen thodaa videern karne ke liye unki pichhali kahani banani thi ki ve kya karne vaale the
 Rosenberg also added some human high-school students, such as Lauren Mellory and Jessica Stanley, who became Jessica's characters in the film and Eric Yorkey, "a compilation of a few different human characters"
 pustak se in bhinnataaon ke bare main, muradian ne kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki hamane vastav main vivekpurna dhang se chaanane kaa kaam kiya
 Our greatest critic, Stephanie Meyer, loves the screenplay and it tells me that we made all the right choices about what to keep and what to lose

 chintamani ghosh bharat ke mahaan printer evam indian press, prayag ke swami the
 He founded this press in 1884, which printed thousands of books in Hindi literature

 Chintamani Ghosh founded the Indian Press in 1884 and proposed to the Nagari Pracharini Sabha in 1899 that the House take over the editing of an illustrated monthly magazine which they would publish
 nagari prachaarini sabha ne iskaa anumodan to kar diya kintu sampadan kaa bhaar lene main apni asamarthta jataai

 The magazine's publisher Chintamani Babu declared the policy statement of the magazine as follows: ganitiya vishleshan main, sisero sankalan saamaanya arthon main abhisaran nahin karne vaale anant sankalan ko maan nirdisht karata he jo maanak sankalan ke saath sannipatit hota he yadi vah abhisari ho
 The Sisera compilation is defined as the marginal value of the mean parallel to the partial compilation of the range
 sisera sankalan kaa namakaran italvi vishleshak arnesto sisera ke sammaan main rakhaa gaya
 Let {an} be a sequence and consider shrenee kaa kvaz aanshik sankalan he The range ∑ n = 1 ∞ an { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n}} Sisera sum a ∈ r { \ displaystyle a \ in \ mathbb {R}} is called Sisaira computable
 Is if the mean of the sum of its partial collections is sk { \ displaystyle s_ {k}}, leading to a { \ displaystyle A}: anya shabdon main, kisi anant shrenee kaa sisera sankalan shrenee ke pratham n aanshik sankalnon kaa samaantar madhya kaa seemaant maan hota he jabaki n anant kii ore agrasar ho
 It can be proved that the convergent series Sisaira are computable and the sum of the series is the same as the Sisaira compilation
 haalanki, nimnlikhit udhaaharan ullikhit karata he ki shrenee apsaari he lekin sisera sankalneey he
 Let an = n + 1 for n ≥ 1
 arthath {an} ek anukram he And let g be a range ∑ n = 1 ∞ an = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ⋯ { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ { \ infty} a_ {n} = 1-1 + 1-
 1 + 1- \ cdots} represents
 tab aanshik sankalnon {sn} = ∑ k = 1 n a k { \ displaystyle = \ sum _{k=1}^{n}a_{k}} kaa anukram nimnlikhit hoga This category g is known as Grandi category which is not convergent
 anya rup main, {sn} ke padon ke madhya anukram {tn} he jahaan Are as follows atah Therefore, the value of Sisaira collection of category g is 1 / 2
 anya rup main, mana n ≥ 1 ke liye an = n he
 That is, {an} is a sequence
 or mana g ek shrenee ∑ n = 1 ∞ a n = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ⋯ { \ displaystyle \ sum _{n=1}^{ \ infty }a_{n}=1+2+3+4+5+ \ cdots } ko nirupit karata he
 Then the sequence of partial compilations of {sn} hoga or g kaa maan anant kii ore apasarit hoga
 Hence, this sequence diverges to infinity like g and now g Sisaira is not computable

 The ph measure is an instrument to measure the acidicity and alkalinity of substances ie ph levels

 Special probes are also used to examine many semi-liquids

 The first commercial ph measure was made in 1936 by Dr
 Arnold Orville Backman of Britain
 california institut of technology ke professor becomen ko ek aisi yukti banane ko kaha gaya, jo neembu ke ras kii amleeyta jaldi or sahi maap sake
 In a measuring device, the activation of hydrogen ion particles surrounding a thin glass bulb at the end of a ph probe is considered to be a value of ph
 ye prob ek laghu voltage utpann karata he, jise peeche laga voltmetre sanvardhit kar paimaane par piech ke maan ke rup main dikhaa detaa he
 The ph meter is used to measure acidification and alkalinity, depending on the concentration of hydrogen ion in the fluid to determine whether the fluid is acidic or alkaline or neutral
 kisi drav ko maapne par agar piech paimaane par 7 maan aata he to iskaa arth he ki yah drav udasin he, isse kam hone par amleey or yadi is paimaane par vah maan 7 se adhik darshaae, to yah drav kshareey hoga
 Often a ph meter is a digital device, in which the voltmeter installed checks the ph
 aam taur par amleey drav soft hota he, jabaki kshareey drav baari
 In the absence of a ph meter, it is tested by adding a chemical agent to the fluid

 Goddard had by then written the script for the film, and Matt Damon also expressed interest in filming Goddard's direction
 lekin tab goderd anya film sinistar sicks ko nirdesan karne menvyast ho gaye, yah ek kamiks pustak pradhan film thi jinhen suparvillan kii team par aadhaarit kiya gaya tha
 Kinberg then focused the book on Ridley Scott

 daiman bhi upanyaas se aakarshith hone saath film kii patakatha or scot ke saath kaam karne kaa avasar milane par bhi kaaphi kuch kaha
 Scott carried out his commitment, completing the project at a very well-planned pace and quickly approved

 Guarantees of service quality are important if network capacity is insufficient, especially for real-time streaming multimedia applications such as voice over IP, online games, and IP-TV, as these often require fixed bit rates and are subject to delay

 So the Internet traditionally operates at the default qos level, or "best efforts"
 prayek IP packet main chaar "seva ke prakaar" bit or teen "purvata" bit maujuud the, lekin unhen nazarandaaj kiya gaya
 These bits were later redefined as diffserv code points and on the modern Internet they are sometimes valued in equivalent links

 The myriad efforts of layer 2 technologies that add qos tags to data gained popularity over the years, but then lost focus

 However, Ethernet today can offer qos and is by far the most popular Layer 2 technology
 ethernet main, abhaasi LAN vibhinn qos staron ko alag karne ke liye istemaal kiye ja sakate hai
 Fiber-to-the-home switches, for example, can typically offer multiple Ethernet ports connected to several different vlans

 mul se gantavy tak kii yatra main packeton ke saath kai baaten ho sakati he, jinke parinamswaroop preshak or praptakarta ke drushtikon se nimnlikhit samasyaayein ho sakati hai: Certain types of network traffic may require a defined service quality, for example: is prakaar kii seva beloch kehalaati he, jiskaa arth he ki bandwidth kaa kuch nunatam str or kaam karne ke liye ek nishchit adhiktam prasupti kaal
 In contrast, elastic applications can take advantage of any amount of high or low bandwidth available
 aam taur par TCP par nirbhar thok fil sthanantaran anuprayog lochadar hote hai
 An alternative to qos complex control mechanisms is to provide high quality communications by generously over-provisioning the network so that capacity is based on peak traffic load estimates
 yah drushtikon purvanumey or halke yatayaat bhaar sahit networkon ke liye saral or kifayati hai

 The arithmetic of packet traffic indicates that networks with qos can handle four times as many calls, including tight jitter requirements, without qos networks
 Yuxel and others have determined that 60% requires additional capacity by simulated IP traffic under conservative assumptions

 At the moment when the Internet serves about one billion users, there is little chance that over-provisioning will eliminate the need for qos as voip becomes more common

 In these situations, developed two different philosophies to successfully manage preferential treatment for packets requiring them
 praarambhik kaary ne network sansadhano ke aarakshan kii intserv darshan kaa istemaal kiya
 In this model, applications used the resource reservation protocol for requesting and reservation of resources through the network
 jabaki intserv tantra kaam karte hai, yah mahasoos kiya gaya ki bade seva pradaata ke theth ek broadband network main, hazaron yaa sambhawatah lakhon aarakshanon ko sweekrut karne, unke anurakshan or kataav ke liye kor routers kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 It is assumed that this approach will not increase with the development of the Internet and if an event is antithetical to the notion of network design so that core routers do more than simply exchange of packets at maximum possible rates
 duusari or samprati sweekrut drushtikon he "diffserv" yaa vibhedit sevaayen
 diffserv model main, packeton ko unke dwaara apekshit seva ke prakaar ke anusaar chihnit kiya jaataa he
 In response to these signs, routers and switches use different queuing strategies to tailor execution to expectations
 chihn IP packet header main 6 bit kaa upyog karte hai
 In the MAC layer, VLAN IEEE 802
1Q and IEEE 802
1p can be used to carry essentially the same information)
 diffserv kaa samarthan karne vaale routers bandwidth niruddh interfes se sancharan kii pratiksha karne vaale packeton ke liye ekaadhik kataron kaa upyog karte hai
 Router vendors provide various capabilities to configure this behavior, to include the number of queues supported, the respective queue preferences and the bandwidth reserved for each queue
 vyavhaar main, jab qatari ke saath interphes se ek packet ko agreshit kiya janaa ho, anya kataron main packeton kii tulana main kam gital kii apeksha rakhane vaale packeton ko ko variyata di jaati he
 Typically, network control packets are allocated some bandwidth by default, while best-effort traffic is allocated the remaining bandwidth
 nimna ko shaamil karte hue, nishpaadan ke or safal prabandhan ke liye atirikt bandwidth prabandhan tantra kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he: As mentioned, while diffserv is used in many sophisticated enterprise networks, it is widely deployed on the Internet
 internet mitra samoohan vyavastha pehle se hi jatil hai or seva pradaataaon main mitra-samooh ke conekshnon ke aar-paar qos samarthan ke liye, yaa aisa karne ke liye samarthit kii jane vaali nitiyon ke sambandh main samjhaute ke liye koi utsaah nazar nahin aata
 a strong example of the need for qos on the Internet relates to this issue of congestion collapse
 internet TCP main antarnihit rup se, sankulan parihaar protocol par nirbhar rahata he, taaki aisi sthitiyon main yatayaat bhaar ko kam kar saken, jo anyathaa internet vighatan kii ore agrasar hogi
 qos applications such as voip and IPTV cannot use TCP, as they require more stable bit-rates and shorter latency times, and otherwise cannot reduce their traffic rates to help prevent disruption
 qos anubandh yatayaat ko simit karte hai jisaki internet ko peshkash kii ja sakati he or is tarah use atibhaarit banane se rokane ke liye, yatayaat anurupan lagu kiya ja saktaa he, atah ve bina vighatan ke vaastavik kaal or avastavik kaal ke mishrit yatayaat ko sanbhaalane kii internet kii kshamta kaa ek anivaary hissaa hai
 The asynchronous transfer mode network protocol has a comprehensive framework for plug-ins in select qos systems
 choti data ikaiyaan or antarnirmit qos, video on demand, wois over IP jaise doorsanchaar anuprayogon main ATM ke kuch adwitiya vikray bindu hai

 is samaadhaan kaa nayaa vichaar prati qos varg alag jitor mulya par sahamat hona tha jo network nodes par lagu kiye gaye hai
 With best effort, four classes of qos were defined, two elastic and two inelastic
 The solution has several benefits: MUSE pariyojna ne ant main apane khud ke qos samaadhaan ko vistaar se pratipaadit kiya, jo mukhya rup se in par aadhaarit he: Internet 2, unlike Abilene Networks, is actually a series of interconnection transfer points of private networks and no networks in themselves

 isliye, qos prakriyaaon par anusandhan jari he jo bade, vividh networkon main pariniojan yogya hon
 Two major approaches to qos exist in modern packet-switched networks, a customized system based on the application expectations transfer with the network, and a preference system where each packet identifies an expected service level for the network

 Gerry Bachula, Internet2's vice president of foreign affairs, claims that specific qos protocols in core networks are redundant as long as core network links are "over-provisioned" to the extent that network traffic never faces delays 
 In "service quality" engineering, this formulation control is guaranteed by the penetration feature

 The name Kurukshetra signifies 'kurukshetra'
 mukhya ullekh : kurukshetra yuddh The region of Kurukshetra has been a region of early Aryans settling in India and is associated with the mythology of the Mahabharata
 iskaa varnan bhagavadgita ke pehle shloke main miltaa he
 Therefore, this region has been called Dharma Kshetra
 thanesar nagar raja harsh kii rajdhani tha, san 1011 i
 main ise mahmud gazanvi ne tahas-nahas kar diya
 Initially Kurukshetra was called the sacrificial altar of Brahma, it was later called Samantpanchak, while Parshuram, in retaliation for his father's murder, made five kundas from the blood of the Kshatriyas, which, with the blessings of the fathers, were transformed into five sacred reservoirs in the course of time
 Are done aage chalakar yah bhoomi kurukshetra ke naam se prasiddh hui jab ki sanvaran ke putr raja kuru ne sone ke hal se saat kos kii bhoomi jot daali
 Kurukshetra was the center of Vedic culture in the Brahmin period and yagyas must have been performed there with expansion
 isi se ise dharmakshetra kaha gaya or devon ko devkirti isi se praapt hui ki unhone dharm kaa paalan kiya tha or kurukshetra main satron kaa sampaadan kiya tha
 It is mentioned in some Brahmin texts that there was a Kauravya king named Bahlik Pratipatiya
 taittiriya brahman main aayaa he ki kuru-paanchal shishir-kaal main purv kii ore gayi, pashchim main ve greeshm ritu main gayi jo sabase buree ritu he
 The mention of Aitareya Brahmin is very important
 saraswati ne kavash muni kii raksha kii thi or jahaan vah daudti hui gayi use parisarak kaha gaya
 At another place the Aitareya Brahmin has come to say that in his era 'nyagrodha' in Kurukshetra was called 'nyubj'
 aitarey brahman ne kuruon evam panchalon ke deshon kaa ullekh vash-ushinron ke deshon ke saath kiya he
 In the Taittiriya Aranyaka, there is a saga that the Devas did a session and for that Kurukshetra was in the form of an altar
 us vedi ke dakshin ore khandav tha, uttari bhaag turghn tha, prishth bhaag pareen tha or maru utkar tha
 This shows that Khandav, Turghna and Parin were the boundaries of Kurukshetra and Maru district was some distance away from Kurukshetra

 It is known that although Vanaparva mentions certain pilgrimages on the Saraswati coast and Kurukshetra in the 83rd chapter, they do not match with the pilgrimages mentioned in the Brahmins and the Shrutasutras, only in the case of 'vinashan' and 'sarak'
 Can go isse yah prakat hota he ki vanaparv kaa saraswati evam kurukshetra se sambandhit ullekh shrautasutron ke ullekh se kai shatabdiyon ke pashchaat kaa he
 Naradiya Purana has given the names of about 100 pilgrimages of Kurukshetra

 The mythological significance of Kurukshetra is considered to be high

 The legendary river Saraswati also has great significance
 iske atirikt anek puraanon, smritiyon or maharishi vedavyas rachit mahabharat main iskaa vistrut varnan kiya gaya hai
 The special fact is that the mythological boundary of Kurukshetra has been reckoned to be 48 kos which includes the area of kaithal, Karnal, Panipat and Jind in addition to Kurukshetra
 iskaa rugveda or yajurveda main anek sthano par varnan kiya gaya he
 The legendary river Saraswati also has great significance
 saraswati ek puranic nadi jisaki charchaa vedon main bhi he
 Apart from this, it has been detailed in many Puranas, Smriti and Mahabharata composed Maharishi Veda Vyasa
 vishesh tathy yah he ki kurukshetra kii puranic seemaa 48 kos kii maani gai he
 It has come in the forest festival that all the people of Kurukshetra are freed from sin and that too who always says - 'I will go to Kurukshetra and stay there
 ' is vishwa main isse badhkar koi anya punit sthal nahin he
 Even the mites of dust here give the ultimate rank to the sinner
 ' yahan tak ki ganga kii bhi tulana kurukshetra se kii gayi he
 The Naradaiya Purana states that the planets, constellations and stars fear falling down from time to time, but those who die in Kurukshetra do not fall on the earth again, that is, they do not take birth again

 In the Atharvaveda there is a discussion of a Kauravya husband, who talks to his wife
 brahman-granthon ke kaal main kurukshetra ati prasiddh tirth-sthal kaha gaya he
 a saga mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmana shows that the Devas performed a yajna at Kurukshetra in which they had previously deprived both Ashvins of the yagya-bhaga
 maitrayani samhita evam taittiriya brahman kaa kathan he ki devon ne kurukshetra main satr kaa sampaadan kiya tha
 The implicit feeling in these utterances is that in the Brahmin period, the Vedic people gave great importance to the sacrifice of Yajna, as it is mentioned in the Rigveda - 'yajnayya Yajnamayajanta Devastani Dharmani Prathamanyasana
 ' The region which was repeatedly plowed by Kuru was named Kurukshetra
 kehete hai ki jab kuru bahut manoyog se is kshetra kii jutai kar rahe the tab indra ne unase jaakar is parishram kaa kaaran poocha
 Kuru said- 'whoever is killed here will go to the virtuous world
 ' indra unka parihaas karte hue swarglok chale gayi
 This happened many times
 indra ne devataaon ko bhi bataaya
 The gods said to Indra - 'if possible, make Kuru friendly to you, otherwise if people go to heaven without sacrificing our part there, then our part will be destroyed
 ' tab indra ne pun: kuru ke paas jaakar kaha-'nareshwar, tum vyarth hi ksht kar rahe ho
 If any animal, bird or human being killed here by staying foodless or fighting it will be part of heaven
 ' kuru ne yah baat maan lee
 This place is called samanta-panchak or Prajapati's Uttaravadi
