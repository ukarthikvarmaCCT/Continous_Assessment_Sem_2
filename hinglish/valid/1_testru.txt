 prerana vyavhaar kii vyakhya karne ke liye istemaal ek saidhantik nirmaan he
 It represents reasons for people's actions, desires and needs
 prerana bhi vyavhaar karne kii disha ke rup me paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 a motive prompts the individual to act in a certain way or at least develops an inclination for specific behavior
 udahraran ke liye, jab koi khaanaa kha ke, apni bhukh kii zaroorat ko puraa karata he, yaa jab koi chaatr achche ank praapt karne ke liye apana sara kaam skool main hi kar letaa he
 In both the examples, there is a similarity between what we do and why
 mir or meyar ke anusaar, prerana shabd lokapriy samskruti kaa hissaa he jaise anya manovaigyanik avadharanaon rahen he
 Theories of motivation can be classified into several types
 prerana ko do alag siddhant main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he- aantarik prerana or bahya prerana
 Intrinsic motivation has been studied since the 1970s
 aantarik prerana kaa nirikshan karne or gyaan praapt karne ke liye ek kshamta kaa vishaleshan karne, nai chizon or nai chunauntiyon ke baahar kii talash karne ke liye swayam kii ichha he
 It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in itself, and exists within the individual, relying on external pressure or a desire for reward
 aantarik prerana kii ghatana pehle pashuon ke vyavhaar kaa praayogic adhyayan ke bheetar sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 Intrinsic motivation is a natural motivational tendency and an important element in cognitive, social, and physical development
 aantarik rup se prerit hue chaatro kii hi kshamtaaon main vruddhi hogi, jo apane kaushal me sudhaar karne ke liye kaam swechha ke saath hi kaam main sanlagn hone kii sambhaavna he
 Bahi motivation refers to performing an activity in order to achieve a desired result and is the opposite of intrinsic motivation
 bahya prerana vyakti ke baahar ke prabhaavon se aata he
 In outdoor motivation it is difficult to answer this question, where do people get inspiration to continue their work with perseverance? Generally, the result which is not achieved by internal motivation, the person to get the external motivation
 Uses aam bahya manshaa puraskaar he jaise paise yaa achche ank, vaanchit vyavhaar dikhaane ke liye or sazaa kaa khatra nimnlikhit durvyavhaar ke liye he
 The competition is a great motivator because it encourages the artist to win and to defeat others rather than just enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity
 saamaajik manovaiianik anusandhan ne yah sanket diya he ki bahya puraskaar atikachity karne ke liye netritv kar saktaa he or aantarik prerana me ek kami paidaa kar saktaa he
 For example - an enthusiastic crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also encouraging external
 saamaajik uddeshyon zyaadaatar hasil kar lee jate hai yaa siikhe jate hai
 Our family entourage, friends, etc
 help to achieve these objectives
 ye kaaphi jatil hote he or ek vyakti kaa saamaajik vaataavaran ke dwaara paye jate he
 According to psychologists, humans have four types of psychosocial intentions
 zyaada se zyaada logo ko acha lagata he jab ve ek samooh kaa hissaa ho
 Group formation is important for human life
 manushya yah chahta he ki vah anya logo ke saat shaareerik or maansik rup se kareeb ho or is dharna ko sambhddhata bulaate he
 They get inspiration for social interaction
 logo main sambanddhikaran paaya jaataa he jab ve asaahaayta mahsoos karte hai yaa ji ghabaraate he yaa bhi jab ve bahut khush hote he
 People who serve this purpose are the ones who maintain their relationships
 vah vyakti prabhaavshaalee kaha jaataa he jo kisi anya vyakti kaa vyavhaar or bhaawanaaon ko apane anusaar badal saktaa he
 The one who succeeds in this task and who has the capacity to achieve it, is a certain influential person
 prerana ke lakshyon he anya logo ko manaanaa, prabhavit karnaa,aakarshith karnaa or unke drushtikon main apni kirti badhanaa
 David Lachland said that people use four types of methods to assert authority: - jab koi utirnta chahta he, us par uplabdhi hone kaa ichha zyaada hota he
 It is seen in the early years of childhood
 jin logo main yah adhiktar prakat hota he ve katin kaary karnaa pasand karte hai
 They desire to know feedback about their performance so that they can change their goals according to the challenges
 kuch log vishesh lakshya ke liye nahin balki jigyaasa paane ke liye kaam karte he
 In search of these subjects, that is, in search of experience, one gets pleasure in getting new information
 is tarah kii khoj sirf manushya me hi nahin, jaanavar me bhi hota he
 People get tired of repetition and want new information
 yah zyaada se zyade baccho me dikhaai pasta he
 This is shown through their behavior and expression such as smiling and grumbling
 unke makasad puraa na hone par ve pareshaan ho jate hai
 That is why we are always looking for romantic experiences
 kuch log vishesh lakshya ke liye nahin balki jigyaasa paane ke liye kaam karte he
 In search of these subjects, that is, in search of experience, one gets pleasure in getting new information
 is tarah kii khoj sirf manushya me hi nahin, jaanavar me bhi hota he
 People get tired of repetition and want new information
 yah zyaada se zyade baccho me dikhaai pasta he
 This is shown through their behavior and expression such as smiling and grumbling

 The story of Kamb Ramayana is derived from Valmiki Ramayana, but Kamban has made hundreds of changes in events according to his vision and belief, not by translating the original Ramayana or chhayanuvaad

 vaishnav bhakthi tatkaaleen manyataon or janata kii bhakthiput bhaawanaaon se jude rahakar is mahakavi ne ram ke charitra ko mahattapurit evam parampurnatv samanvit aise ayaamon main prastut kiya jinaki iyatta or idriktaa sahaj grahya hote hue bhi acolpaneey rup se manohar kinwa manoram thi

 Mind maps are considered a type of spider diagram
 1970 ke dashak main isi tarah kii avadharana "vichaar suraj phod " tha
 The term "mind map" was first popularized by the use of illustrations that visually "map" the trail back centuries by using British popular psychology writer and television personality Tony Buzan, branching and radial maps

 is sho, or saathi pustak shrinkhalaa main, Buzan radial kii apni avadharana ko badhaava diya ped, ek rangeen, ujjwal, ped kii tarah sanrachana main mahatvapurn shabd aarekhan

 Heinlein and AE van Vogt

 Buzan's treatment also uses then-popular beliefs about the functions of the brain hemispheres in order to explain the claimed increased effectiveness of mind mapping over other forms of note-making
 Buzan man ke nakshe banane ke liye nimnlikhit nirdeshon ko detaa he: As with other drawing tools, mind maps can be used to generate ideas, generate, structure, visualize, and classify and solve problems, and make decisions by studying information about organizing, and for writing As an aid

 haalanki kuch shuddhtavaadi bhagya ko khel kaa vaanchhneeya ghatak nahin maanate, jabaki anya maanate hai ki ek vaanchhneeya ghatak ke tatv vividh or bahupaksheeya ranneeti bana sakate hai jaise ki apekshit mulya or jokhim prabandhan ko pramukhataa di jaani chahie
 The third important aspect in a game is diplomacy, or players compromising with each other
 jaahir he ki spasht kaarnon se, solitare kisi anya khilaadi kii jarurat nahin he
 Two-player games usually do not involve diplomacy
 is prakaar, aamtaur par yah teen yaa usase adhik logon ke saath khele jane vaale khel par hi lagu hota he
 The important aspect of The Settlers of Katan, for example, is to persuade people to trade with you instead of other players
 risk main, kootneeti ke prabhaav kaa ek udhaaharan yah he ki jab do yaa adhik khilaadi duusare ke khilaaf gut bana lete hai
 In simple diplomacy it is explained to other players that someone else is winning so it is necessary to unite against them
 kathin kootneeti main vishwasghaat kii sambhaavna se, ek saath milakar vistrut yojana bananaa he
 The game tries to bring luck in many ways
 aam taur par sabase lokapriy tarika he, chah paksheeya paase kaa upyog karnaa
 This can be gauged, such as in monopoly, how many times a player has lost his or her token, such as how their army succeeded in battle at risk, or such as what resources a player has in The Settlers of Catan

 german style board game main bhagya kaarak kam hone kii vajah se ve uttar-america board games ke mukaable adhik lokapriy hai
 Although many board games have their own jargon, they have a generalized vocabulary to describe the basic game process and concepts, and for common board games all the properties are almost the same
 aisi vibhinn shreniyan hai, jinamein board games ko alag kiya ja saktaa he
 The following is a list of some of the most common of these: shakti pravardhak kaa kaary voltage pravardhak se praapt output ko shakti pradaan karnaa he
 For example microphone dwaara praapt vidyut tarang ko voltage emplifaire pravardhit karata he, ise sidhe laudspikar ko dene par yah pun: inhe dhwani tarango me badal nahi paayegaa
 Hence the output from the voltage amplifier is given to a power amplifier
 jisase laudspikar ko sanchalit karne yogya power praapt ho jaataa he
 definition- "vah trangistor pravardhak jo audio aavriti siganlon ke power str ko badhaata he, trangistor audio shakti pravardhak kehalaata he"
 Features 1
 isamen prayukt power trangistor kaa aakaar voltage pravardhak ke trangistor se bada hota he
 2
 It produces more heat
 3
 isamen nimna b maan vaale tathaa mote base vaale trangistor prayog karte hain
 4
 Transformer coupling is used in power amplifier
 5
 isamen lod kaa maan kam hoti he
 6
 The collector current and output power are high
 7
 iskaa b maan hota he
 8
 Output impedance is low
 mahatvapurn- Actually no power amplifier amplifies the power, rather it takes power from the connected dc supply at the output and converts it to ac signal power
 chunki yah voltage pravardhak se praapt ucch voltage signal kaa pravardhan karata he atah ise large signal pravardhak kahana uchit hoga
 Importance of impedance matching adhiktam shakti sthaanantaran prameya ke anusaar kisi network main adhiktam shakti tabhi transafar hogi jab lod pratirodh strot pratirodh ke tulya ho
 That is, maximum power can be provided from the power amplifier to the loudspeaker only when the source impedance and load impedance are the same
 sutara- ^ 2 = jahaan N1 and N2 are the number of primary and secondary coils of transformer respectively
 R'L = input pratibaadha RL = output impedance
 shakti pravardhak kii collector dakshata- "the ratio of the dc power supplied by the battery to the ac output power obtained from the power amplifier and the power amplifier is called its collector efficiency
