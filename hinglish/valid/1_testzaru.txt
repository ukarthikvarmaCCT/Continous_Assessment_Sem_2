 Along with this, Anil directed the play 'goat', which was written by N

 When he saw German director Fritz Benevits, he liked it so much that he invited him to play together

 The dance derives its name from the village of Kuchipudi in Divi taluk of Krishna district, where the Brahmins residing practice this traditional dance
 parampara ke anusaar kuchipudi nrity mulat: keval purushon dwaara kiya jaataa tha or vah bhi keval brahman samudaay ke purushon dwaara
 These Brahmin families were called Bhagavathalu of Kuchipudi
 kuchipudi ke bhagwatthalu brahmanon kaa pehla samooh 1502 isvi ke aasapaas nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Their programs were dedicated to the deities
 prachlit kathaon ke anusaar kuchipudi nrity ko punarparibhaashit karne kaa kaary siddhendra yogi naamak ek krishna-bhakt sant ne kiya tha
 Fifteen Brahmin families of Kuchipudi have carried on the tradition for more than five centuries
 pratishthit guru jaise vedantam lakshmi narayan, chintaa krishna murti or tadepalli peraaya ne mahilaon ko isamen shaamil kar nrity ko or samrudh banaaya he
 Dr
 Vemapathi Chinna Satyam added several dance dramas to it and created the dance structure of several solo performances and thus broadened the horizon of the dance form
 yah parampara tab se mahaan bani hui he jab purush hi mahilaon kaa abhinay karte the or ab mahilaayein purushon kaa abhinay karne lagi hai
 The dance is performed in a special traditional way
 manch par paramparaagat pujan ke pashchaat prayek kalakaar manch par pravesh karata he or ek khaas layaaddh rachana dharu ke dwaara apana paatr-parichay detaa he

 bharat muni, jinhone natya shaastra kii rachana kii, is prakaar ke nrity ke kai pahaluon kii vyakhya prastut karte hai
 Later, during the 13th century, Siddhendra Yogi gave it a different distinctive style

 He composed a Natyavali called Parijataharanam

 Instead, for the sake of international law, that union becomes a sovereign state as the only entity

 kundakundacharya digambar jain sampradaay ke sabase prasiddh acharya the
 He also had another name 'kaundkund'
 inke naam ke saath dakshin bharat kaa kondkundpur naamak nagar bhi judaa hua he
 According to Professor A
N
 Upadhyay, their time is first century AD, but there is no definitive evidence about their period
 shravanbelagola ke shilaalekh sankhya 40 ke anusaar inkaa dikshakalin naam 'padmanandi' tha or simandhar swami se unhen divyagyaan praapt hua tha
 Acharya Kundakund took Digambar Muni Diksha at the age of 11
 inke diksha guru kaa naam jinchandra tha
 He was a great scholar of Jainism
 inke dwaara rachit samaysar, niyamsar, pravachan, ashtapahud, or panchastikaay - panch parmagam granth hai
 He also went to Videha region
 vahaan par inhone simandhar nath kii saakshaat divyadhvani ko suna
 He was the patron and teacher of Jainism for 52 years
 ve jain saadhuon kii mul sangh kram main aate hai
 They are also known by these names in ancient texts- gautam ganadhar ke baad acharya kundakund ko sampurna jain shastron kaa ek maatr gyaata mana gaya he
 His name has an auspicious significance for the Digambars and is the third place in sacred praise after Lord Mahavira and Gautam Ganadhar- acharya kundakund tattwarthsutra ke rachiyata acharya umaswami ke guru the
 Kundakundacharya was the Principal Acharya of Mool Sangh
 tapashcharan ke prabhaav se anek alokik siddhiyaan inhen praapt thim
 They are mentioned with great respect in the Jain tradition
 shastrasabha ke aarambh main mangal bhagwaan vir ke saath-saath mangal kudakundadyo kahkar inkaa samaran kiya jaataa he jisase jain shashan main inak mahatv kaa pataa chalata he
 He has first given a logical rendering of jain-agam-agreed substances
 inke sabhi uplabdh granth praakrit main hai
 It has been his specialty that he has rendered Jainism in the light of his own philosophical ideology, and not only re-discourses of Jain proceeds
 inke vibhinn granthon main gyaan, darshan or charitra kaa nirupan miltaa he
 He wrote independent texts to describe each subject, which is called Pahud
 inke 84 pahudon kaa ullekh jain vaanmay main miltaa he
 Following are his main texts: jain darshan ko unhone ek nai drushti di he
 He is considered to be the exponent of 'transcendental imperialism'
 jain aagmon main dravya or paryaay main bhed or abhed donon mana jaataa he
 But according to them, their distinction is practical, ultimately both are integral
 isi prakaar aatma main varna kaa sadbhaav or asadbhaav donon aagamasammat hai, parantu inke anusaar vyaavhaarik rup main to varna aatma main hai, parmaarthik rup main nahin hai
 He considered the unity of body and soul in practice, but in the determination, he considered the difference between the two
 ve dravya ko satta se abhinn maanate he
 In Vaishika philosophy, power considers matter to be true due to normal, but he says that in this opinion, matter will become dissatisfied due to separation from power
 at: dravya satta rup hi he or yahi paramtatv he
 Power develops in the form of matter, quality and substance in the country, so everything is a matter of matter
 gun or paryaay kaa dravya se abhed maananaa tathaa nayabhed se satkaryawad or satyakaryawad donon ko sweekaar karnaa, unka abhipret tha
 Regarding the atom, he says that the final component of all the wings is the atom
 yah shaashvat, shabdarahit, avibhajya or moort he
 The atom was said to be the resultant element containing senses, smell, color and touch and considered to be the origin of earth, water, light and air
 aupnishad or mahayan darshanon main vyavhaar or parmarth athwa pratibhaas or satya kaa bhed mana gaya he
 By considering this distinction, spiritualist philosophers honor an individualism
 jain darshan bhootvaadi he, aadhyatmavaadi nahin
 Nevertheless, he considered a distinction between behavior and determination
 jo saamanyat: dikhaai detaa he vah sarvada satya nahin hota or koi aavashyak nahin ki satya sadaa shuddh rup main gochar ho
 He considered three forms of the soul
 bahya padaarthon main aasakt, deh ko apane se abhinn samajhane vaali moodhaatma bahiraatma he
 When the body becomes aware, it is said that the soul that is moksamarga is the conscience
 dhyanabal se karmmal kaa kshay ho jane par jab aatma shuddh rup praapt kar leti he
 Then it is called God
 isi paramatma ko unhone shiv, brahma, vishnu, buddha aadi kahkar tatkaaleen darshan se apane ko parmarthat: abhinn ghoshit kiya he jo sambhavat: kisi jain acharya ne nahin kiya
 It is his specialty that distinguishes him from the other Jainacharyas and is a reflection of his syncretic tendency
 unhone aatma ko kaary-karan se bhinn maanakar sankhya ke kutasth purush kii kalpana ke saath samanvit kiya parantu aatma ko akarta nahin mana
 In his opinion, the soul is not the agent of non-committal culmination, but it is also considered to be the doer due to its consequential
 aatma gyaan aadi swagat parinaamon kaa to karta he hi
 He said that the element cannot be described with behavior and determination
 tatv pakshaatikrant he
 The creature is in pure form, not impaired
 bandha-abandh se vimukt jeev hi sahaysar or paramatma paramtatv kaha gaya he
 Practices are resolved with determination
 inkaa kahana he ki nishchaynay kaa aashray lekar yadhyapi tatv kaa gyaan hota he, tathaapi tatvagyan ho jane par nishchiyanay kaa bhi naash ho jaataa he

 Lloyd claims he was bullied at school, however, as Chris Yates, headmaster of St
 Hilda's, an old school in Lloyd, said, "he has no memory of being persecuted, lying, and no teacher of any such incidents
" Can't remember when Daniel was bullied
 Actually i was convinced by his former friends that the opposite is true

 On 11 January 2007, it was revealed that a lawsuit was being filed against Lloyd by Miss Great Britain Company for breaking the contract and defaming the company

 In his column he said, "the things i am waiting for in my house xxrep 7 
 i am meeting some people whom i may never meet in my everyday life, seeing if i can face challenges and let people see themselves in a different way at home "

 People who already live here should get jobs
 Since then, it has become clear that Lloyd had been warned against racist behavior by an e-mail sent by his agent, Angela de Fau, at the time before going into the house

 unhone dakshin bharat main jati tathaa jati pratha, saamaajik starikaran, saanskritikaran tathaa pashchimikaran par kaary kiya
 They presented the concept of 'dominant caste'
 'mysore narsinhachaar shrinivas' ko san 1977 main bharat sarkaar dwaara vigyaan evam abhiyantriki ke kshetra main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 They are from Karnataka
 aupchaarik rup se bhartiya samajashaastra ke aadi-purush bhale hi na hon, lekin swatantra bharat main is anushaasan ko unhone apane saidhantik yogadan, jati kii vilakshan samaj or sahabhaagi prekshan kii paddati ke istemaal se jitna samrudh kiya he vah unhen desh ke shirshatam samaaj-vigyaniyon main shaamil karne ke liye paryaapt he
 In sociology, he is known for his original foundations like Sanskritisation, dominant caste and vote bank
 shrinivas sansthaaon ke nirmaataa bhi the
 He is credited for the establishment of departments of sociology in Baroda and Delhi University
 shodh or adhyayan ke ucchstareey sansthaanon kii sthapana or disha-nirdesan ke lihaaz se bhi bhartiya samajashaastra ke vikaas main unka yogadan kaaljayi mana jayega
 Apart from a specific study of rural community and caste structure, M

 Srinivas has also done thought provoking work on topics such as social impact of science, Gandhi's religious thinking, history of anthropology and gender
 shrinivas kaa krititv vastunishth paryvekshan, vishleshan kii maheentaon tathaa saidhantik gaharaai kaa durlabh sangam mana jaataa he
 His writing provides a particular ground context for inter-subjectivity
 shrinivas kii samajashastreey drushti ghatnaon kii bahari banaavat ko bhed kar unhen gadhane vaali sanrachanaon or aitihaasik shaktiyon kii thaah leti he
 His ability to present the nuanced details and insights of community life in simple language gives him a distinct personality from contemporary sociologists
 is arth main ve vishaygat shabdaawalee kaa atikaraman karte hue saadhaaran or prachlit bhashaa ko chunate hai
 It will be called the democracies of his scholarship that his theoretical concepts help in understanding the subject rather than engaging in his own ideas
 shrinivas ne vicharadhara ke str par bhartiya samajashaastra ke liye ek nayi zamin taiyaar kii
 It is worth mentioning that at the time when Srinivas was preparing to study Indian society, American and British academic installations dominated social sciences
 america vishvavidhyalayon main prachlit drushtikon bhartiya upmahadweep ke samaaj ko samajhane ke liye sanskritnishtha paramparaon par jor detaa tha
 As a result, Indian sociologists considered Sanskrit sources and Indology / Indology to be more authentic for the study of contemporary reality
 shrinivas pehle samajashastri the jinhone is varchasvkaari sthiti ko chunauti di
 He proved from his writings that in sociology, the study of the actual activities and activities of society is better than relying on classical references
 shrinivas dwaara prastut prabhutvshaalee jati tathaa samskruthikaran kii avadharanaon kaa raajnneeti vigyaniyon ke alaava itihaas-lekhan kii sabaltern jaisi dhaaraon ke itihaaskaaron ne vyapak prayog kiya gaya he
 In this sense, his work can be placed in the category of an intellectual tradition which has acquired the status of an important reference for new and old scholars
 prasangvash, prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana sankhya bal, bhu-swaamitv, shiksha or naukari jaise karkon ke kaaran kisi jati ke gaanv yaa kshetra vishesh main dabadabe ko jaahir karti he to samskruthikaran nimna jatiyon dwaara ucch jatiyon khaas taur par brahman varg kii samskruti, reeti-rivaazon, bhashaa or veshbhusha aadi ko apnaane kii pravriti ko gyaapit karti he
 Though his third concept vote bank could not make a permanent place in social sciences, the term is used indiscriminately in the daily discourse of politics and media world
 swatantra bharat kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sanrachana ke adhyayan main ye teenon avadharanaayen or usase jude vimarsh tattvik mahatva hasil kar chuke hai
 The concepts of dominant caste and culturalization help in understanding the decisive elements of India's social system and its organizational structure

 In the politics that emerged after the Dalit movement and the Mandal Commission, the trend of Sanskritisation has weakened, but the concept of dominant caste is still seen as an essential tool in analyzing the political processes in rural society in India
 kai samakaleen samajashastri shrinivas ke krititv ko rashtravaadi samajashaastra ke brihattar sandarbh main rakhkar aankane kaa aagrah karte rahe hai
 He says that the urban elite of independent India wanted to continue the project of modernization of colonial rule
 isliye rashtravaadi samajashastriyon ke krititv main chintan or vichaar kii vahi aupniveshik saraniyan sakriy thi jinke aadhaar par british satta apane shashan ko vaid tehraati aayi thi
 These scholars say that the work of sociologists like Srinivas focused on caste and community provides a benchmark for understanding of an all-india Sanskritist Hinduism
 lekin shrinivas kii drushti ko prakat yaa aprakat taur par british yaa america maanavshaastra kii sthapanaaon se nirdeshit bataanaa jaldbaaji kii daleel he jo subooton kii kami ke baavjood aarope patr taiyaar karne kii himakat karti he
 This argument fails to target the tendency of Srinivasa's work in which Srinivas studies the community and also considers the duality of the community and its relations
 shrinivas samajashaastra or maanavshaastra kii buniyadi prasthaapanaaon par bhi thik isi tarah vichaar karte hai
 It is worth noting that Srinivas defines himself as a fellow scholar, as a fellow scholar, whose identity is not different from his subject ie people
 shrinivas jin logon yaa samudaay kaa adhyayan karte the unhen ve anya kii shrenee main nahin rakhte the
 In this regard, many British anthropologists have believed that anthropologists studying their society face different kinds of difficulties
 unke anusaar viksit desh kaa maanavshastri ek deshaj maanavshastri ko uski nimnatar sthiti kii ore ishaara karke hameshaa ek khaas saanche main kaid rakhana chahta he
 Srinivas, while clarifying the position of the indigenous anthropologist on this issue, wrote that when an Indian anthropologist studies any caste or other group of India, that caste or group is other for him but at the same time does not ignore this
 It should be done that certain cultural forms, beliefs and values of that caste or group also match the said scholar
 yani aisi sthiti main bhartiya maanavshastri asal main ek tarah se anya main swa kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 In this sense, that caste or group is not completely unfamiliar to him or her as both are connected to the same culture
 shrinivas is sthiti ko asaamaanya dhang se jatil, bahuparti or dwaidhapurna maanate hai
 Looking carefully, Srinivas does not seem to be accused of being a nationalist sociologist given the points of difference and equality with his subject
 vastav main shrinivas is baat par jor dete hai ki adhyayan main aatm or anya kii yah bahulata maanavshastri ke apane samudaay kaa sadsy hone yaa bahari hone kii ekalata se kahin zyaada shreyaskar he
 It is noteworthy that he uses many observations from the Chicago School to study the caste system of the village of Rampura, which was chosen by Srinivas for his research studies
 varna kii prak-british avadharana ko shrinivas kitaabi nazariyaa siddh karte hue yah kehete hai ki yah drushti jati ke gatisheel pakshon ko gaun kar detii he
 Although Srinivas's caste-study focused on the local structure of a village, he was also conscious of the pan-india prevalence of this phenomenon
 apane ek lekh main ve is tathy kii ore ishaara karte hai ki jati nihsandeh ek akhil bhartiya sanrachana he, kyonki desh main har jagah aise samooh dekhe ja sakate hai jo paitrukataa tathaa vaivaahik sambandhon ke aadhaar par ek vishisht samooh kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Srinivas also cites traditional employment of these groups in this regard
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki desh main har jagah brahman, achhut, kisaan, dastkaar, vyapaaree or dusron kii seva karne vaali jatiyon kaa astitv dekha ja saktaa he
 In this caste study, Srinivas also mentions regional variations and factors such as western education, administrative jobs, city income, which have had a major impact on the caste structure
 is tarah deergh avadhi ke lihaaj se dekhen to ek samajashastri ke taur par shrinivas ne bhartiya gram or jati kii sanrachana ko aupniveshik dharanaon ke saidhantik varchasv se bhi mukt karaayaa he
 At the same time, he also countered the beliefs of sociologists like Dumon who were proposing that caste differences do not allow the Indian village to become a community
 shrinivas jab gramin samudaay kii sankalpana or gaanvon kii aarthik-saanskrithik antar-nirbharta kii baat karte hai to ve avyakt dhang se akhil bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat bhi karte hai
 Some scholars believe that Srinivas has adopted a Brahminical or upper caste point of view in the study of caste
 lekin is daleel ko sahi kone se dekhen to vah darasal aupniveshik samajashaastra se nikali prathit hoti he
 Srinivas's logic-plan actually exposes the macro and under-concerned perceptions of Western sociologists regarding India's rural communities
 sankshep main kaha jaae to shrinivas kaa krititv pashchimi gyanshastreey prasthaapanaaon, swa, samudaay tathaa raashtra kii dharanaon ke aalochakeey vimarsh main kai buniyadi tark muhaiyaa karaata he

 To understand Indian society and culture, it is mandatory to practice the books and research conducted by MN Srinivas

 This is the name of the discipline - jurisprudence or jurisprudence; As Vatsyayan has said: anvikshiki main swayan nyaay kaa tathaa nyaaypranali se anya vishyon kaa adhyayan hone ke kaaran use nyaividya yaa nyaayashastra kaha jaataa he
 Considered the best among the disciplines
 vatsyayan ne arthshaastrachaarya chanakya ke nimnlikhit vachan ko uddhrut kar anvikshiki ko samast vidyaon kaa prakaashak, sampurna karmon kaa sadhak or samgr dharmon kaa aadhaar bataaya he- Gautama Rishi, the originator of justice, is said to be a resident of Mithila
 gautam ke nyayasutra abtak prasiddh hai
 Vatsyayan is the commentary of the sage on these sutras
 is bhashya par udyotkar ne vaarthik likhaa he
 Wachaspati Mishra has written the interpretation of the script in the name of 'judicial Meaning'
 is tikaa kii bhi tikaa udaynacharya krit 'taptarya-parishuddhi' he
 Vardhaman Upadhyaya is 'prakash' on this purification
 nyaayashastra ke vikaas ko teen kaalon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he - aadyakaal, madhyakaal tathaa antyakaal 
 Justice of the ancient period will be called "ancient justice", justice of the medieval period is "communal justice" and justice of the end period is "navyanya"
 "nyaay" shabd se ve shabdasmooh bhi vyavahrut hote hai jo duusare purush ko anumaan dwaara kisi vishay kaa bodh karaane ke liye prayukt hote he
 ) Vatsyayana has called him "supreme justice" and has given the origin and substance of ideas of the form of plea, jalpa and vittanda
 nyayavid vidwaanon ne nishreyas ko nyaayashastra ke adhyayan kaa prayojan mana he
 Disarmed, Shreyas means exclusion, salvation means the complete retirement of all kinds of sorrows
 aisi nivritti jiske baad kabhi kisi prakaar ke du:kha hone kii sambhaavna hi nahin rah jaati
 This is the best effort among man's religion, meaning, work and salvation in these four-pronged efforts
 nyaayashastra ve adhyayan se padaarthon kaa tatvagyan hota he or usase aatmatatv kaa saakshaatkaar hokar moksh kii prapti hoti he
 The elemental interview leads to complete liberation from all sorrows through the retirement of misanthropy, the absence of misinformation, the separation of ragas, malaise and moharoom doshas, the absence of dosha from half and half form trends and the absence of rebirth
 jaisaa ki gautam ne kaha he : The number of substances which lead to salvation from philosophy is considered sixteen in this scripture; Their names are: bhartiya vaanmay main nyaayashastra ke do bhed maane jate hai- vaidic nyaay or avaidic nyaay
 Buddhist justice and Jain justice are included in non-vedic justice
 vaidic nyaay main - vaisheshik nyaay, sankhya, yoga nyaay, purv mimasaa tathaa uttar mimasaa nyaay kaa samavesh he, kintu nyaayashastra ke naam se akshapaad gautam ke nyayasutra tathaa unke aadhaar par nirmit samast pracheen arvachin sahitya ko hi abhihit kiya jaataa he
 The Vedas are considered irrefutable proof in Vedic justice, but there are also jurisprudence prevalent in India, which is treated with the words "buddhnayya" and "jaina"
 in nyaayashastron main veda ke pramantv kaa bade abhinivesh se khandan kiya he or inaki adhiktar manyataayen vaidic nyaay se atyant viruddh hai; kintu yah hone par bhi ye apane vikaas ke liye vaidic nyaay ke nishchit rup se adhamarn hai
 Although there has been substantial development and refinement of Vedic justice as a result of their conflict with these two, it also has its own fundamental form which is absolutely unaffected by it, when it seems that in relation to these vedic judgments its origin is also Vedic
 Full of justice
 400 i
 se 1200 i
 tak kaa kaal avaidic nyaay ke utkarsh kaa kaal mana jaataa he
 When jurisprudence emerged in India, it cannot be said right
 naiyayikon main jo pravaad prachlit hai unke anusaar gautam vedavyas ke samakaleen thaharte hai; par iskaa koi pramaan nahin he
 'envirkshiki', 'rationalism', 'hetuism' are aptly mentioned in Ramayana and Mahabharata
 ramayana main to naiyayik shabd bhi ayodhyacand main aayaa he
 Panini has instructed justice to be an abusive word
 nyaay ke pradurbhaav ke sambandh main saadharantah do prakaar ke mat paae jate hai- The meaning of the word justice which has come in the Aastambha Dharmasutra should be understood with the intention of forethought
 madhavacharya ne purvamimasaa kaa jo sarasangrah likhaa uskaa naam 'nyaayamala-vistaar' rakhaa
 Vachaspati Mishra has also written a treatise on epistemology called 'nyayakanika'
 par nyaay ke pracheenatv se bengal kaa gaurav samajhanevaale kuch bengali panditon kaa kathan he ki nyaay hi sab darshanon main pracheen he kyonki or sab darshanasutron main duusare darshanon kaa ullekh miltaa he par nyaysutron main kahin kisi duusare darshan kaa naam nahin aayaa he
 Although it cannot be said that justice is ancient in all philosophies, it can be said that the rules of logic were prevalent long before the propagation of Buddhism, whether they were epistemological or independent
 hemchandra ne nyaysutron par bhashya rachnewale vatsyayan or chanakya ko ek hi vyakti mana he
 If this is correct, then the commentary is pre-buddhist preaching
 kyonki buddha dharm kaa prachaar ashok ke samay se or buddha nyaay kaa aavirbhaav ashok ke bhi peeche mahayan shakha sthapit hone par hua
 But the union of Vatsyayana and Chanakya cannot be considered right on the basis of the verses of Hemachandra
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kathan he ki vatsyayan isa kii paanchavin shatabdi main hue
 In the sixth century of Christ, the Vasavadutakar Subandhu mentions these four nayayikas as Mallanag, Nyasastha, Dharmakirti and Udyotkar
 inamen dharmakirti prasiddh buddha naiyayik the
 Udyotkaracharya founded Vatsyayana's opinion by refuting the famous Buddhist Naayyak Dinagacharya's text entitled 'pramanasamuchaya' 'pramansamucchy' main didnag ne vatsyayan ke mat kaa khandan kiya tha
 From this, it is certain that Vatsyayan was preceded by Dynag
 mallinath ne dinnag ko kalidas kaa samakaleen batalaaya he, par kuch log ise thik nahin maanate or dinnag kaa kaal isa kii teesri shatabdi kehete hai
 With the mention of Subandhu, the time of Dinnagacharya ends before the sixth century, so it is not right to consider Vatsyayana in the fifth century before him
