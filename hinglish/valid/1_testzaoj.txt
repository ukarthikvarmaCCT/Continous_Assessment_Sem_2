 bhediya ek kaalpanik kirdaar he, jo bhartiya kamiks prakaashak raaj kamiks ke pramukh mahanayakon main se ek he
 The wolf was composed in December 1993 by Dheeraj Verma
 varsh 1997 ko, bharat main pehali baar digital rangon dwaara kobi or bhediya kii kamiks prakashit hui
 About fifty thousand years ago, there used to be a republic called Wolfano, whose inhabitants were highly developed species of wolf-humans, which were powerful and even ran dopa
 unke raja vulpha bhi ek bhediya-maanav the, jinhen ek maanav kanya, rajkumaari survaya se pyaar ho jaataa he
 She was the princess of the human republic Konkani
 vulpha apane gururaj bhaatiki kii tamaam hidaayaton ke baavjood jaadui vaseekaran maala ke bal par survaya se vivaah kar lete hai or is tarah danpati ko, kobi praapt hota he
 Fifty years pass and by accident, the curse inflicted on Kobi ends and he finds himself in the Assam forest
 phir vah "bhediya" ke naam se ek nayaa jivan aarambh karata he
 Now the identity of the wolf is known by its dense stature with dense oil, long tail and shining eyes
 vah bahut shiddat se vanavaasiyon kii suraksha karata or badale main vanavaasi use bhediya-dev samajhakar puja karte
 People used to call him as "jallad of the Jungle", in the form of a call among all the helpers and criminals
 bhediya apane guru, bhaatiki, jo use ladaai ladanaa sikhaata he
 Bhatiki then divides the wolf into "kobi" and "wolf" in two parts
 bhaatiki apane shishy kobi ko vaapis vulphano chalane kaa aadesh detaa he
 But his efforts fail
 isi bich maanviya bhaag bhediya or pashu bhaag kobi donon jine se vivaah karne kii koshish karte he, jisamen koi bhi jangal chhodane ko raji nahin hota
 In these 10 years, Kobi resides in the Assam forests, protecting his area from many dangers, but sometimes getting into trouble due to his stupidity
 bhediya tathaa kobi lagbhag ek hi sharir ke ang hote hue bhi vyaktitv swabhaav main bilkul bhinn hai
 Where Kobi is goth, foolish and fierce in nature, the wolf is practically mature and intelligent
 adivasee bhediya kaa sammaan karte or apana rakshak maanate, jabaki kobi ke gusse yaa coup kaa bhaajan banane se bachane kii prayaas karte, haalaanki kai baar kobi jangal main ai musiibat se bhi bachaata, magar sirf apni sharton par
 Body composition: Length- 8'0 load- 154 kg
 Body composition: Length- 8'0 load- 138 kg
 Body composition: Length- 6'6 weight- 122 kg
 kobi apni adbhut dum ko apni icchaanusaar lambaai badha saktaa he or vah iskaa prabal hathiyaar ke taur par upyog bhi karata ho
 At the same time, he invokes his wolf god in very dangerous situations, where a deadly mace appears in his "help" form and he blows away the opponents
 jab kabhi kobi madad ke bhediya fouj ko pukaarata he, to kshan bhar main vah puraa ilaaka ghir jaataa he
 These wolves also considered him to be their god and worshiped him
 kobi ke paas apni "bhediya-mukh pattica" jo use swasth hone kii takat detaa he magar yah fouran nahin hota
 In fact, he has three divine ornaments that are the source of his powers; a necklace, 2 stiff wrist pairs and a wolf face plaque
 bhediya ek dhurandhar yoddha he jise mul kobi kii tarah hi viraasat main dwandwakala kii nipunata hasil he
 The wolf is knowledgeable of many ancient skills and martial arts and has also defeated Kobi many times on this same strength
 kobi or bhediya main ham spasht asaamantaayen dekh sakate hai
 The wolf is highly intelligent, practical, efficient and full of human qualities, so Kobi is notorious for his animal intelligence, arrogance, aggressive and angry nature
 baavjood donon hi gururaj bhaatiki kii sikhaai dwandwakala main maahir hai
 All his life, wolf and coby have been fighting many illegal traffickers, hunters and forest mafia

 ] mahadwipiya visthaapan prithvi ke mahadwipon ke ek-duusare ke sambandh main hilne ko kehete hai
 If seen in geographical epochs of millions of years, then it seems that the continents and their parts are sitting on the sea floor and flowing in some direction
 mahadwipon ke bahane kii avadharana sabase pehle 1596 main dach vaigyanik abraham ortalius ne prakat kii thi lekin 1912 main german bhuvaigyanik alfred vegener ne swatantra adhyayan se iskaa viksit rup prastut kiya
 Later, the theory of plate tectonics developed which enabled the movement of continents to be better understood than continental flow
 abraham ortalius, theodor christoff liliyenthal, alexander won hambolt, antonio snidar-pelegrini tathaa anya ne pehle hi yah dhyaan diya tha ki atlantic mahaasaagar ke donon vipareet chor ke mahadwipon ke aakaar ek duusare main thik-thik baithte hai 
 dablyoo
 je
 kius ne ortalius ke vichaar ko is prakaar varnit kiya: Alfred Wegener hypothesized in 1912 that they were a unified landmass before continents crumbled
 vegener kaa siddhant swatantra rup se bana tha va apane purvavartiyon kii tulana main adhik utkrisht tha, baad main vegener ne kuch puraane lekhakon ko milte julate vichaaron kaa shrey diya:franklin coxwardi ,roberto mantovani, wiliam henry pickring or frank barsle tailor 
 For example: From the geological similarities of the southern continents, Roberto Mantovani hypothesized in 1889 and 1909 that all the continents had previously coalesced into one very large continent; Wegener found similarities in his maps of the southern continents of Mantovani
 The continent broke up due to the thermal expansion caused by volcanic activities and new continents began to flow away from each other, as the rift areas, which now have oceans, also continued to grow
 isi vajah se mantovani ne vistaarsheel prithvi kaa siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya, jo tab se galat dikhaayi padataa he
 Frank Bursley Taylor proposed the continental flow without expansion, suggesting in 1908 that the continent was pulled to the equator by the moon's gravitational force during the Khamtimya, which is why the Himalayas and the Alps were formed to the south
 Wegener stated that all these theories closely resemble his own theory, although Taylor's theory is not fully developed
 vegener "mahadwipiya pravaah" shabd kaa prayog karne vaale pratham vyakti the evam yah pariklpana aupchaarik rup se prakashit hui ki mahadweep kisi prakaar se "pravaahit" hokar dur chale gaye
 Although they gave sufficient evidence for continental flow, they could not give a reliable explanation of the physical process that led to this flow
 unka yah suzav, ki mahadweep us apkendriya chhadam-bal ke kaaran khinch gaye jo ki prithvi ke ghurnan athwa khagolic aynansh ke kaaran utpann hua, asweekaar kar diya gaya kyonki gananaaon se yah siddh hua ki yah bal iske liye paryaapt nahin tha
 The Paulfleukt hypothesis was studied by Paul Sophus Eptstein in 1920 and found to be unreliable
 mahadwipiya pravaah ke ab vyapak sakshya hai
 Fossils of plants and animals found on the coasts of different continents seem to have been linked once
 messosoras, taaje pani kaa ek sarisrup jo ki ek chote ghadiyal jaisaa tha, ke jeevashm kaa brazil tathaa dakshin africa main paaya janaa iskaa ek udhaaharan he; ek or udhaaharan listrosoras naamak ek jamini sarisrup ke jeevashm kaa samasamyik chattaanon se dakshini america, africa tathaa antarctica ke vibhinn sthanon se praapt hona he
 There is also some living evidence - some similar animals are found on both these continents
 udhaaharan ke liye kuch kentuon ke kuch parivaar / prajatiyaan africa or dakshin america main paae jate hai
 The complementary arrangement of the front portions of South America and Africa is clear, but it is a temporary coincidence
 lakhon varshon main slab khinchaav va rij dabaav tathaa tectonophizix kii anya shaktiyaan in mahadwipon ko ek dusre se or adhik dur le jaayengi tathaa ghumaayengi
 in asthaayee visheshtaon ne vegener ko iskaa adhyayan karne ko prerit kiya jise unhone mahadwipiya pravaah naam se paribhaashit kiya, yadhyapi ve apni pariklpana ko logon dwaara sweekaar kiye jane tak jivit nahin rahe
 The large distribution of permo-carboniferous glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica, and Australia is a major evidence of the flow of continents
 oriented himand shrinkhalaa tathaa tilites namak jamaav se bane satat himand ek bahut bade mahadweep gondvanaa ke astitv kii pushti karte hai jise mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant kaa kendriya tatva mana jaataa he
 These ranges show glacial drift in modern coordinates, moving away from the equator and moving toward the poles, as well as showing that the southern continents were in dramatically different places in the past and were connected to each other
 haalanki ab yah mana jane laga he ki prithvi kii sataha par mahadweep gatisheel rahete hai - yadhyapi unki gati disha nirdeshit hoti he naa ki ve dishaheen rup se chalan karte hai - phir bhi saidhantik rup se is pravaah ko kai varshon tak sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 One problem was that no reliable driving force was shown
 saath hi vegener kaa bhugarbha vaigyanik nahin hona bhi ek samasya thi
 In 1953, five years before Carrey introduced the plate tectonic theory - the theory of continental flow was rejected by physicist Schidiger on the following grounds
 yah ab gyaat he ki prithvi par do prakaar kii crust hoti hai, mahadwipiya crust va mahasagariya crust, jahaan pehali vaali ek bhinn sanrachana vaali tathaa mularoop se halki hoti he, donon hi prakaar kii crust ek kahin gahare draveekrut aavaran par sthit hoti hai
 In addition, oceanic crusts are still forming at the spreading centers, and this, along with subduction, drives the system of plates chaoticly resulting in continuous orogeny and isostatic imbalance
 plate tectonix ke dwaara in sab tathaa mahadwipon kii gati ko kahin behatar rup se spasht kiya ja saktaa he

 Craze is generally associated with a person's "socially inappropriate" bizarre or unique behavior
 yah aavashyak nahin he kii aisa vyavhaar pramanya rup se anupyukt ho, parantu phir bhi ise vicitra yaa anaavashyak mana jayega
 Craze is compared to "normal" behavior, this general behavior is an almost comprehensive means by which social individuals solve problems and follow the priorities of everyday life
 jo log lagaataar saamaanya rup main bhi sanak bharaa vyavhaar karte hai unhen "sanakee" kaa naam diya jaataa he
 The medieval Latin is derived from eccentricus, derived from the Greek ekkentros, meaning "from outside the center", which is derived from the "+ kentron" center "from outside ek -, ex -"
 sanakee shabd sabase pehle 1551 main angreji main ek khagoleey shabd jiskaa arth he, "ek dayera jisame prithvi, surya aadi apane centre se bhatak jate hai" main dikhaai diya
 paanch saal baad, 1556 main, is shabd kaa ek visheshan rup joda gaya
 129 years later, in 1685, the definition evolved from literal to symbolic, and the use of the word eccentric began to describe unconventional or bizarre behavior
 is shabd kaa sangyaatmak rup - ek vyakti jiske paas ye aparamparaagat athwa vicitra gun / vyavhaar hon or jo inkaa pradarshan karata ho - 1832 tak nahin dikhaai diya tha
 The relationship of fad is often associated with talent, intellectual ability or creativity
 kisi vyakti ke sanakee vyavhaar kaa arth us purush yaa stri kii vishisht budhimatta yaa rachanaatmak prerana kii bahari abhivyakti se lagaaya jaataa he
 According to this style, the habits of a freak are not incomprehensible because they are fruitless or the result of some insanity, but rather because they arise from fundamental ideas that do not have social affirmation
 angreji upyogetavaadi vichaarak jon stuart mil ne likhaa he ki "ek samaaj main sanak kii maatra aam taur par usamen yukt pratibha, maansik shakti or naitik saahas ke anupaat main hoti he", or saath hi main unhone sanak kii kami ko "samay kaa mukhya khatara" bataate hue shok prakat kiya he
 Edith Sitwell wrote that the craze is "often a kind of naive ego"
 ve ye bhi kehete hai ki pratibhashali or shisht vyakti isaliye sanakee kehalaate hai kyonki "ve puri tarah se nirbhay or samaaj ke vichaaron or anischitataaon ke prabhaav se baahar hote hai
 a person who is in the position of "water bin fish" is not eccentric by proper definition
 sambhavtah vah purush yaa stri apane mul paryaavaran kii paramparaon ke anusaar aam ho saktaa he
 Eccentrics may or may not understand the parameters of normal behavior in their culture
 ve saadharantah samaaj dwaara apnin aadaton yaa bhaawanaaon kii asweekruti ke prati udasin hote hai
 Many highly intelligent people of history have also exhibited unusual behavior and habits
 kuch sankiyon ko pratibhashali ke sthaan par "murkh" jaankaar nindit kiya jaataa he
 Eccentric behavior is often considered to be faddish or bizarre, although it can also be awkward and painful
 kai vyakti, jaise kii vimaanon ke bahut bade or amir vyapaaree harvard hus, jo pehle keval sanakee maane jate the, haal hi main punarawalokan ke pashchaat vastav main maansik beemaari se grast paae gaye

 The ruling queen / king is theoretically vested with the authority of a constitutional ruler, but due to centuries-old common law, sovereigns are obliged to exercise most of their powers only in accordance with the specifications of Parliament and Government

 in anek rashtron ke chinhatmak samanaantar pramukh hone ke naate, british ekarat swayan ko rashtramandal ke pramukh ke kitaab se bhi nawazte hai
 Although the ruler is referred to as the British ruler, but in principle, all nations have equal authority over the sovereign, and all countries of the Commonwealth are completely independent and autonomous
 britain kii rajatantric vyavastha main, raja / rani ko rashtrapramukh kaa darj diya gaya he
 In the British political system, which has been progressively developing and changing over a period of thousands of years, the traditional and real powers of the ruler have been fluctuating

 Therefore, most of the works done by the rulers in the name of Rajmukut, whether done by the ruler himself, such as the Queen's address or the state inauguration of Parliament, the decisions of Surrey work are taken elsewhere: vidhayik kaary maharani sasansaad dwaara, sansad, house of lords or house of comons kii salaah or sweekruti dwaara kiya jaataa he, vahin, kaaryakari shaktiya maharani ke naam par unki mahima kii sarkaar dwaara abhyayit kiye jate hai

 Traditionally, the authority to convene and dissolve the session of Parliament was at the discretion of the ruler, and the ruler voluntarily called and dissolved the assembly
 atah dharnatmak rup se aaj bhi sansad bulaane va bhang karne ke adhikaar kaa abhyay shaasha hi karte hai
 The fixed-term Appropriations Act passed in 2011 put an end to the right to dissolve Parliament

 If a minority government demands dissolution of Parliament and declaration of new elections, the ruler is completely free to reject such demand

 And the Adhirat also takes the oath of patronage of the Church of Scotland, and is also responsible for appointing the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church, otherwise, he has no meaningful role in Girja's work, nor does he have any authority over it 
 visthapit carch of wales tathaa carch of ireland main samprabhu kaa koi aupchaarik bhoomika nahin he

 parantu bharat ne rashtramandal kii sadsyta barqaraar raakhi
 Since then, in Commonwealth countries, the British sovereign is also given the position of "head of the Commonwealth", which is the nominal head of the organization of the Commonwealth
 is pad kaa koi rajnatik arth nahin he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries

 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament

 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession

 varttman samay main mukutiyaa esteton se ai mudra kii maatra civil list yaa adhirat ko pradaan kiye jane vaale anya anudaanon se bhi adhik he
 Thus between 2007-08 Crown Estates increased the treasury by £ 200 million, while 40 million pounds were paid by Parliament
 atah 7
