 18–24 main uddhrut) Modern uses of "ethnic" grouping, however, reflect industrial states with a variety of encounters with subordinate groups, such as immigration and colonizing subjects; "ethnic groups" stood out as opposed to "nations" for the purpose of referring to people who have distinct cultural identities and who, through migration or conquest, have become subservient to a foreign state

 The modern usage definition of the Oxford English Dictionary is as follows: a n great britain or sanyukt rajya america kii saadhaaran bhashaa main angreji shabd "ethnic" ke upyog ke vishay main likhte hue, waleman yah tippanee karte hai ki Thus in present day colloquialism, there is still a circle of foreign people, minority issues and ethnic relations around the words "ethnic" and "ethnicity"

 German sociologist Max Weber is also among the first to introduce the term "ethnic group" to the social sciences, defining it as: maanav samooh jo apane samaan udbhav kii aatmanishth dharna ko ek jaisi shaareerik banaavat yaa rivaajon yaa donon ke kaaran yaa upniveshan or pravaas kii yaadon ke kaaran maanate he; yah dharna samooh gathan ke liye mahatvapurn honi chahie; iske alaava isse koi fark nahin padataa ki ek vishayashrith rakt-sambandh maujuud he yaa nahin
 Weber states that the ethnic groups were Kynstlish, because they were based on subjective belief in a shared gemineshaft

 " In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of "ethnic groups" in the use of "social scientists", often more than the native reality, reflected the wrong label:

 In this way, he pointed to the fact that an ethnic group's identity, if identified by outsiders such as anthropologists, may differ from the self-identification of that group
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki upyog ke pehle ke dashakon main, jaateeyata shabd kaa prayog aksar saajha saanskrithik pranaaliyon or saajha viraasat vaale chote samoohon ke sandarbh main "saanskrithik" yaa "janajaatiy" jaise puraane shabdon ke sthaan par prayog kiye jate hai, parantu us "jaateeyata" main donon hi janajaatiy or aadhunik samaajon main samoohon kii pahchaan pranaaliyon main samaantaaon ko varnit karne main sakasham hone kii atirikt khubi thi
 Cohen also suggested that claims of "caste" identity are often colonialist practices and an influence of relations between colonized peoples and nation-states
 saamaajik vaigyanikon ne isliye is baat par dhyaan kendrit kiya ki kaise, kab or kyon jaateey pahchaan ke vibhinn suchak khaas ban jate hai
 Therefore, anthropologist Joan Vincent noted that ethnic boundaries are often of unstable character
 ronaald kohen ne nishkarsh nikaala ki jaateeyata "antarveshan or ekantik kii ek nirmaanadhin dvibhaajaneekaran shrinkhalaa he"
 ve joan vincent ke avlokan se sahamat hai ki "jaateeyata 


 ko seemaa ke sandarbh main, raajnneetik jutav ke vishisht aavashyaktaaon ke sambandh main, sankuchit yaa vistrut kiya ja saktaa he
 This may be the reason why dynasty is sometimes an indicator of ethnicity and sometimes is not: which trait of ethnicity is predominant and depends on whether people are promoting ethnic boundaries up or down and They amplify them above or below it generally depends on the political situation
 jaateey vargeekaran ko dusron dwaara labling yaa aatm-pahchaan dwaara paribhaashit kiye jane kii samasya se bachane ke liye, yah upaay sujhaayaa gaya ki in avadharanaon jaise "jaateey shreniyan", "jaateey networkon" or "jaateey samudaayon" yaa "prajati" ko ek duusare se alag kiya jaae
 Many different approaches have been used by various social scientists to understand ethnicity, when they tried to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society
 is tarah ke tareekon ke udhaaharan hai: aadimavad, tathvikwaad, sthayitvvaad, rachnawad, aadhunikwaad or karnavaad
 Prior to Weber, race and ethnicity were often seen as two aspects of the same thing
 1900 ke aas-paas or usase pehle jaateeyata kii tathvik aadimavaadi samaj pradhan thi, logon ke bich saanskrithik bhinnata ko viraasat main mili lakshanon or pravritiyon ke parinaam ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 At the same time "sciences" such as enlightenment claimed that they were able to correlate cultural and behavioral properties between different populations by their external physical structure, such as the shape of the skull
 webar dwaara jaateeyata ko ek saamaajik nirmaan ke rup main parichay die jane par, nasl or jaateeyata ek duusare se vibhajit kiye gaye
 According to biology a social belief rested on well-defined races
 1950 main unesco kaa bayaan "da res queschan" main, jo us samay ke kuch antarrashtriya str par khyaati praapt buddhijiviyon, dwaara hastakshrit kiya gaya, sujhaayaa gaya: "yah jaruri nahin he ki rashtriya, dharmik, bhugolic, bhashaai or saanskrithik samooh nasleey samoohon ke saath mail khaae: or is tarah ke samoohon kii saanskrithik visheshtaon kaa nasleey gunon ke saath koi pradarshit anuvanshik lakshan sambandh nahin he
 Because habitually serious errors in the use of the word "race" in general lore, it would be better to talk about 'ethnic groups' except for the word "race" when referring to human race
 " In 1982, American cultural anthropologists, collecting forty years of ethnographic research, argue that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic indicators of the ways in which people from different parts of the world have joined the global economy: woolf ke anusaar, europea vyapaarik vistaar kii avadhi ke dauraan naslon kaa or poonjivadi vistaar kii avadhi ke dauraan jaateey samoohon kaa, nirmaan or samavisht kiya gaya
 Ethnicity often indicates shared cultural, linguistic, behavioral, or religious traits
 udhaaharan ke liye, khud ko yahudee yaa arab kahalaane ke liye turant bhashaai, dharmik, saanskrithik or nasleey gunon ke put ko utpann karnaa hoga jise prayek jaateey shrenee main samaan mana jaataa he
 Such broad ethnic categories have also been termed as ethnicity
 yah unhen choti, adhik vyaktiparak jaateey gunon se pruthak karata he, jise aksar sookshmjatiyata kaha jaataa he
 In some cases, particularly those involving international migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is associated with nationality
 maanavvigyaani or itihaaskaar, jo arnest gelnar or benedict anderson dwaara prastaavit jaateeyata ke aadhuniktaavaadi samaj kaa paalan karte hai, ve raashtra or rashtrawaad ko satrahavin sadi main aadhunik rajya pranali ke saath viksit hote hue dekhte hai
 He ended with the emergence of "nation-states" in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation converge with state boundaries
 is prakaar, pashchim main, jaateeyata kii dharna, nasl or raashtra kii tarah, europea upniveshik vistaar ke sandarbh main viksit hone lagi, jab vanikwaad or poonjeevaad jansankhya ke vaishvik andolanon ko badhaava de rahaa tha or saath hi saath rajya simaaen adhik spasht or sakhti se paribhaashit kii ja rahi thim
 In the nineteenth century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through claims to represent "nations"
 haalanki, raashtra-rajya, nishchit taur par us aabaadi ko shaamil karata he jo kisi ek yaa anya kaarnon se rashtriya jivan se apvarjit kar die gaye hai
 Consequently, members of excluded groups will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or self-government, sometimes to the extent of complete political isolation in their own nation-state
 in paristhitiyon main - jab log ek rajya se duusare rajya main sthanantarit hote hai, yaa ek rajya par vijay praapt karte hai yaa apni rashtriya seemaa ke pare logon ke upnivesh banaate hai - jaateey samooh aise logon dwaara banaai gai, jinaki pahchaan ek raashtra ke saath he, parantu ve rahete duusare rajya main hai
 Sometimes ethnic groups become subject to hostile attitudes and actions by the country or its constituents
 beesvin sadi main, log yah tark dene lage ki jaateey samoohon ke bich yaa ek jaateey samooh ke sadasyon or rajya ke bich sangharsh ko in do main se ek tareeke se suljhaayaa janaa chahie
 Some, such as Eugen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states should be based on the notion of political rights of the autonomous individual public
 is vichaar ke anusaar, rajya ko jaateey, rashtriya yaa nasleey pahchaan ko manyata dene ke bajaay sabhi vyaktiyon kii raajnneetik or kanoonee samanta lagu kerani chahie
 Others, such as Charles Taylor and Will Camelika, argue that the notion of individual autonomy is in itself a cultural construct
 is vichaar ke anusaar, rajyon ko apni jaateey pahchaan ko samajhnaa chahie or aisi prakriyaaon ko viksit karnaa chahie jinke madhyam se jaateey samoohon kii vishesh jaruraton ko raashtra-rajya kii simaaon ke bheetar samyojit kiya ja sake
 The nineteenth century saw the emergence of political theory of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was combined with nationalism by German theorists such as Johann Gottfried von Herder
 samaaj ke jaateey sambandhon par tark saadhy rup se itihaas yaa aitihaasik sandarbh kaa bahishkaar kiye jane tak, dhyaan kendrit karne ke udhaaharan rashtravaadi lakshyon ke samarthan main falit hue

 The history of latecomers in the model of the nation state, such as the pre and South Eastern Europe arising after the disintegration of the Ottoman and austro-hungarian empires, as well as those that originated from the former USSR, was marked by inter-ethnic conflict is

 is prakaar, yah sangharsh aksar gumraah karne ke liye ankit or naagarik yuddh ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya, jabaki ve ek bahu-jaateey rajya main ek antar-jaateey sangharsh hote hai
 In the United States, the term "ethnic" is used in a much broader sense than is commonly used in some other countries
 jaateeyata aam taur par sambandhit samoohon ke sangrahan ko sanderbhit karata he, jiskaa adhik sambandh akruti vigyaan, vishesh rup se twachaa ke rang par aadhaarit he or raajnneetik simaaon par nahin
 The term "nationality" is commonly used more for this purpose
 america main sarvaadhik vishisht rup se, latin america vyutpann aabaadi ko "hispanic" yaa "latino" jaateeyata main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 Several previously named oriental ethnic groups are now classified as Asian racial groups for the census
 "blike" or "africa america" alag hote hue bhi, donon kaa america ke jaateey shreniyon ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he
 In the late 1980s, the term "african American", was considered a most appropriate and politically correct race title
 jabaki ise america ateet ke nasleey anyaay se visthaapan ke rup main lakshith kiya gaya tha, jo "blike res" ke aitahaasik drushtikon se judaa tha, yah bade paimaane par blike, colord, nigro or unke samaan shabdon kaa, jo kisi bhi kaali twachaa vaale vyakti kaa bina uski bhugolic mul kii parvaah kiye zikr karti he, maatr saamaanya pratisthaapan ban gaya
 Similarly, fair-skinned Americans from Africa are not considered "african American"
 kai africa america bahu jaateey hai
 More than half of African Americans are also descendants of great-grandfather Europeans, and only 5 percent of great-grandfather descendants are Native Americans
 "aam taur par white shabd un logon kaa varnan karata he jinaki vansh parampara ke chihn europe main paae jate hai or jo ab sanyukt rajya america main based hai
 Middle Easterners may also occasionally be included in the "white" category

 pan ium udaan 73, pan american world airways kii ek bowing 747-121 udaan thi, jiskaa 5 sitambar, 1986 ko pakistan ke karachi main abu nidaal organizeshan ke chaar hathiyaarband philistini ugravadiyon dwaara apharan kar liya gaya tha
 The ship, carrying 360 passengers, had just arrived from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport to Jinnah International Airport in Karachi and was preparing to go to John F
 Kennedy Airport in New York, USA via Frankfurt, Germany
 june 2001 main ek adaalat main aatankwaadiyon par yah abhiyog laga ki ve saipras va israel main bandi apane kuch saathiyon ko chhudaana chaahate the
 But in 2006, Michael Thexton, a passenger who survived the incident, published a book in which he claimed he had heard hijackers talking that they wanted to crash the ship into a designated target in Israel
 is hijac ke dauraan 20 yatri maare gaye jinamein 12 bhartiya the tathaa baaki america, pakistan va mexico se the
 All the kidnappers were arrested and sentenced to death
 kintu, baad main unki sazaa ko umrakaid main badal diya gaya jiskaa ki bharat va america ne virodh kiya
 The incident started when passengers in Karachi started boarding this plane going to Frankfurt
 baad main hui epabiai jaanch main pataa chalaa ki vimaan ke aasapaas hathiyaarband rakshakon kii maujuudagi bhi is apharan ko taal nahin pai
 The four hijackers were disguised as Karachi airport security guards and were armed with assault rifles, grenades, pistols and plastic explosive belts

 Changes were made to this van in such a way that it looks like an airport security vehicle

 The hijackers attacked the stairs itself and fired from automatic weapons, entered the aircraft and snatched away control
 flit atendent ne sthiti ko bhaanp liya or chaalak dal ko intercom par suchit kar diya jiske falswaroop payalat, sah-payalat or flite igeneer kaukapit ke apaat dwaar se safaltaapurvak nikal bhaage
 After capturing the aircraft, the hijacker Zaid Safarini soon realized that the crew had fled and was forced to negotiate with the authorities
 pratham va vayavsaayik shrenee ke yatriyon ko vimaan ke peeche kii ore jane kaa aadesh diya gaya tathaa peeche ke yatriyon ko aage aane ko kaha gaya
 Since the plane was almost full, passengers were since the plane was almost full, passengers sat down in the aisles, galleys and door exits
 At around 10 in the morning Safarini made a detour inside the aircraft and stopped in front of 29-year-old Indian American Rajesh Kumar's seat
 rajesh california kaa nivasee tha tathaa haal hi main use america naagarikta mili thi
 Safarini asked Rajesh to come forward and forced her to sit on her knees at the door of the plane with her back to the head
 adhikariyon, visheshtah viraph daroga se baatcheet karte hue usne kaha ki yadi chaalak dal ko 15 minute main vimaan main nahin bheja gaya to vah rajesh ko goli se uda degaa
 Shortly afterwards he got upset with the authorities and in front of everyone he shot Rajesh in the head and threw him on the ground outside the door
 pakistani adhikariyon kii report ke anusaar rajesh kii saans abhi chal rahi thi, kintu aspataal pahunchane se pehle raste main ambulance main hi uski mrityu ho gai
 Safarini then returned to the rest of her companions and instructed the flight attendants to collect the passports of all the passengers
 atendents ne apni jaan ke dar se is aadesh kaa paalan kiya
 One of the flight attendants, Neerja Bhanot, feared that American passport holders could be specially targeted, so she hid some American passports under one seat and some in the trash
 passport ikatthe karne ke baad ek kru sadsy ne intercom par ek british naagarik maaikel thexton ko vimaan ke agle hisse main aane ko kaha
 He reached the next part of the plane through the curtain where he encountered Safarini who had his passport in his hand
 usne thexton se poocha ki kahin vah sipaahi to nahin or kahin uske paas bandook to nahin
 Thexton replied no
 tab usne thexton ko ghutanon ke bal baithne ko kaha or adhikariyon se bolaa ki agar koi vimaan ke nazadik aayaa to vah ek or yatri ko mar daalega
 Viraf Daroga tells him that the aircraft has a crew member who can use the cockpit's radio and can be further negotiated through it
 safarini thexton ke paas vaapis gaya or poocha ki kya use pani chahie
 Thexton said - Yes
 safarini ne yah bhi poocha ki kya vah vivaahit he or daawa kiya ki use hinsa or ye sab maar kaat bilkul pasand nahin he lekin america or israel ne unke desh par kabza kar liya he or ve dhang kii zindagi nahin ji paa rahe
 Then a hijacker asked Thexton to return
 hijac kaa prakaran raat tak chalata rahaa
 During this time, a flight attendant quietly took out the leaf from the manual detailing all the systems of the 3R aircraft gate and concealed it in a magazine and gave it to the passenger sitting near the gate
 usne use kaha ki vah abhi magazine ko avashya pard le or baad main yadi aavashyaktaa padi to prayog kar le
 On this page, along with other information, the method of opening the exit gate and installing the slide apron was also described
 raat lagbhag 9 baje sahaayak vidyut unit band ho gayi, sabhi battiyaan bujh gayi tathaa immergency lite jal gayi
 Passengers at the front were ordered towards the back, while passengers at the back were ordered forward
 Since the aisles were already full of passengers, those passengers standing just sat down
 With the plane out of power and sitting in near darkness a hijacker at the 1L door said a prayer and then aimed to shoot at the explosive belt the other hijacker at the 1R door was wearing
 The intent was to cause an explosion massive enough to kill all passengers and crew on board, as well as themselves
 Since the cabin was so dark, the hijacker missed causing only a small detonation
 Immediately the hijackers began shooting their weapons into the cabin at passengers and attempted to throw their grenades
 Yet again the lack of light caused them to not pull pins fully and create small explosions
 Ultimately it was their bullets that created most damage since each bullet would bounce off the aircraft and create crippling shrapnel
 The flight attendant at the 3L door decided it was time to take action and opened the door and although the slide did not deploy several passengers jumped down the 15 ft to the Tarmac, including crew
 The passenger that was near 3R had read the page the flight attendant earlier gave him and was able to successfully open that door
 It was the only door opened to have the slide deploy
 Ultimately this slide allowed for more passengers to evacuate safely and without injuries
 Neerja Bhanot assisted a number of passengers to escape from the flight, then she laid down her life shielding three children from the bullets fired by the terrorists
 Twenty passengers were killed and over a hundred were injured, but many escaped the ordeal including Michael Thexton, who came close to death a few hours before and returned to the U

 Educational psychology is the branch of psychology that studies how human learns in an educational environment and how educational activities can be made more effective
 'shiksha manovigyaan' do shabdon ke yoga se bana he - ‘shiksha’ or ‘manovigyaan’
 Hence its literal meaning is educational psychology
 duusare shabdon main, yah manovigyaan kaa vyaavhaarik rup he or shiksha kii prakriya main maanav vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karne vaala vigyaan he
 Psychology has influenced all aspects of education such as education objectives, teaching method, curriculum, assessment, discipline etc
 bina manovigyaan kii sahaayta ke shiksha prakriya sucharu rup se nahin chal sakati
 Education psychology refers to the application of psychological principles to improve the teaching and learning process
 shiksha manovigyaan shaikshik paristhitiyon main vyakti ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he
 Thus in education psychology, the behavior, mental processes and experiences of a person are studied under educational conditions
 shiksha manovigyaan manovigyaan kii vah shakha he jiskaa dhyey shikshan kii prabhaavshaalee takneekon ko viksit karnaa tathaa adhigamakarta kii yogyataon evam abhiruchiyon kaa aankalan karnaa he
 It is a branch of behavioral psychology that strives to improve teaching and learning
 shiksha manovigyaan vah vidhayak vigyaan he jo shiksha kii samasyaon kaa vivechan, vishleshan evam samaadhaan karata he
 Education has never been separate from psychology
 manovigyaan chaahe darshan ke rup main rahaa ho, usne shiksha ke madhyam se vyakti kaa vikaas karne main sahaayta kii he
 According to naveen binwal: education psychology studies human behavior in educational situations
 shiksha manovigyaan apana arth shiksha se, jo saamaajik prakriya he or manovigyaan se, jo vyavhaar sambandhi vigyaan he, grahan karata he
 According to Amit kumar: Education psychology describes and explains the learning experiences of a person from birth to old age
 Manzoor ahmad ke anusaar : shiksha manovigyaan vyaavhaarik manovigyaan kii vah shakha he jo shiksha main manovaigyanik siddhanto tathaa khojon ke prayog ke saath hi shiksha kii samasyaon ke manovaigyanik adhyan se sambandhit he
 According to lala ji: educational psychology represents the application of scientifically derived theories influencing the teaching and learning of human responses
 bharat main main shiksha kaa arth gyaan se lagaaya jaataa he
 According to Gandhiji, education refers to the proper development of one's body, mind and soul
 shiksha manovigyaan ke arth kaa vishleshan karne ke liye skinner ne adholikhit tathyon kii ore sanket kiya haih- Callie has stated the need for education psychology as follows: - shiksha manovigyaan ke kshetra ke bare main skinner ne likhaa he ki shiksha manovigyaan ke kshetra main vah sabhi gyaan tathaa pravidhiyaan se sambandhit he jo seekhney kii prakriya ko acchhee prakaar se samajhane tathaa adhik nipunata se nirdhaarit karne se sambandhit hai
 According to modern education psychologists, the main areas of education psychology are as follows: shiksha kii mahatvapurn samasyaon ke samaadhaan main manovigyaan sahaayak hota he or yahi sab samasyaayein va unka samaadhaan shiksha manovigyaan kaa kaaryakshetra banate hai - Kelly has analyzed the functions of education psychology as follows - shiksha manovigyaan kaa sambandh seekhney evam seekhney kii vidhiyon arthath padhaane se he
 Education and psychology are two clear branches of knowledge, but both of them are closely related
 The basis of modern education is psychology
 bachche ko uski ruchiyon, rujhaanon, sambhaawanaaon tathaa vyaktitv kaa dhyanpurvak adhyayan karke shiksha di jaati he
 Today education and psychology complement each other
 skinner skinner kaa mat he ki ‘‘shiksha manovigyaan shiksha kaa ek aavashyaktatv he
 Education cannot be solved without its help
 shiksha tathaa manovigyaan donon kaa sambandh vyavhaar ke saath he
 Psychological discoveries have a deep impact on other aspects of education
 ’’ Education and psychology is the coordination of theory and practice, knowledge of mutual relationship between education and psychology is necessary for the coordinated balanced development of human beings
 shiksha ke samaan kaary, manovigyaan k siddhanton par aadhaarit he
 According to Crow and Crow, "psychology is the science of human behavior occurring in contact with the environment"
 Psychology describes human development related to learning
 shiksha, seekhney kii prakriya ko karne kii cheshtaa pradaan karti he
 Education psychology is related to the why and when of learning
 ’’ The link connecting education and psychology is "human behavior"
 is sambandh main do vidwaanon ke vichaar drushtavy he :- Brown- "education is the process by which a person's behavior changes
" ’’ Pillsbury- "psychology is the science of human behavior
 ’’ It is clear from these definitions that both education and psychology are related to human behavior
 shiksha maanav vyavhaar main parivartan karke use uttam banaati he
 Psychology studies human behavior
 is prakaar shiksha or manovigyaan ke sambandh hona swaabhaavik he par is sambandh main manovigyaan ko aadhaar pradaan karata he
 Education has to get the approval of psychology for each of its functions

 jha ne thik hi likhaa he- ‘‘shiksha jo kuch karti he or jis prakaar vah kiya jaataa he uske liye ise manovaigyanik khojon par nirbhar hona padataa he
 '' manovigyaan ko yah sthaan isliye praapt hua he kyonki usne shiksha ke sab kshetron ko prabhavit karke unamem krantikari parivartan kar diya he
 In this context, these pithy sentences of Ryan are notable - yah sab shiksha manovigyaan ke upyog ke kaaran sambhav hua he
 In short, psychology has made the following contribution in the field of education- shiksha kii samasyaayein uske uddeshyon, vishay vastu, sadhano evam vidhiyon se sambandhit he
 Psychology helps in solving problems in these four areas
 manovigyaan shiksha ke uddeshyon ko acchhee tarah se samajhane main nimna prakaar sahaayta pradaan karata he
 Psychology plays an important role in understanding the content of education and determining it according to the development of the student
 kis kaksha ke chaatro ke liye vishaywastu kya ho? apratyaksh paathyakram kis prakaar kaa ho jisase chaatro ke maansik swasthya par vipareet prabhaav na pade aadi mahatvapurn prashnon kaa samaadhaan manovigyaan karata he
 With the help of psychology, mankind can be used for the welfare of the world
 manovigyaan shiksha ke sadhano ko samajhane main sahyog pradaan karata he, kyonki- Psychology gives knowledge about the methods of teaching in three ways - davis ne shiksha manovigyaan ke mahatv kii is prakaar vivechna kii he - manovigyaan ne chaatro kii abhikshmataaon evam unamem paae jane vaale vibhinnataaon kaa vishleshan karke shiksha ke kshetra main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 It has also contributed to the school years by imparting knowledge about the manner of growth and development of the student
 blair ne shiksha manovigyaan ke mahatv ko nimna shabdon main bataaya he - Different authors have given different definitions of education psychology
 isliye shiksha manovigyaan ke kshetra ke bare main nishchit taur par kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 In addition, education psychological is a new and growing science
 iske kshetra anishchit he or dharanaen gupt he
 a lot of research is being done in its fields right now and it is possible that new concepts, rules and principles of education psychology will be obtained
 iskaa bhav yah he ki shiksha manovigyaan kaa kshetra or samasyaayein anishchit tathaa parivartansheel he
 Whatever be the following areas or problems can be included in the field of education psychology
 kro and kro- ‘‘shiksha manovigyaan kii vishay saamagree kaa sambandh seekhney ko prabhavit karne vaali dashaon se he
 '' shiksha manovigyaan ko vyavhaarik vigyaan kii shrenee main rakhaa jane laga he
 Being a science, many methods developed in its study as well
 ye vidhiyaan vaigyanik hai
 In the words of George A
 Lundberg - shiksha manovigyaan main adhyayan or anusandhan ke liye saamaanya rup se jin vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he unako do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa haih- Some of these major methods are described as follows: - aatm nirikshan vidhi ko arntadarshan, anternirikshan vidhi bhi kehete he
 According to Stout, "the systematic study of one's mental activities is called internal inspection
" ’’ woodworth ne is vidhi ko aatmanirikshan kaha he
 In this method, one's mental actions are subjective
 aatmagat hone ke kaaran aatmanirikshan yaa antardarshan vidhi adhik upyogi hoti he
 According to Locke - the inspection of one's own actions by the brain
 vyakti adhyayan vidhi kaa prayog manovaigyanikon dwaara maansik rogiyon, aparaadhiyon evam samaaj virdohi kaary karne vaale vyaktiyon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Often a psychologist is brought up by many types of people
 inamen koi apradhi, koi maansik rogi, koi jhagadaaloo, koi samaaj virdohi kaary karne vaala or koi samasya balak hota he
 The psychological, physical, family and social environment of a person leads to mental imbalance
 jiske falswaroop vah avaanchhneeya vyavhaar karne lagata he
 To find the real reason for this, he connects the episodes of the person's prior history
 is uddeshy se vah vyakti uske mata pita, shikshakon, sambandhiyon, padosiyon, mitron aadi se bhent karke poochtacha karata he
 In this way, he collects facts regarding a person's inheritance, family and social environment, interests, actions, physical health, educational and emotional development, which leads to improper conduct as a victim of psychosis
 is prakaar is vidhi kaa uddeshy vyakti ke kisi vishisht vyavhaar ke kaaran kii khoj karnaa he
 Crowe and Crowe wrote, "the main purpose of the life history method is to diagnose a cause
" ’’ The extrusion method is also called the observation or inspection method
 avlokan yaa nirikshan kaa saamaanya arth he- dhyanpurvak dekhnaa
 We can estimate one's inner state of mind by observing the behavior, behavior and actions, reactions etc
 from outside
 udaahranartha- yadi koi vyakti jor-jor se bol rahaa he or uske netra laal he to ham jaan sakate he ki vah krodh me he
 You can guess a person is happy to see him laughing
 nirikshan vidhi main nirikshankarta, adhyayan kiye jane vaale vyavhaar kaa nirikshan karata he or usee ke aadhaar par vah vishay ke bare main apni dharna banaata he
 Practicalists have given special importance to this method
 colesnic ke anusaar nirikshan do prakaar kaa hota he- Formal inspection is performed in controlled conditions and informal inspection is conducted in uncontrolled conditions
 inamen se anaupchaarik nirikshan, shikshak ke liye adhik upyogi he
 He gets many opportunities to observe his students' behavior in and outside the classroom
 vah is nirikshan ke aadhaar par unke vyavhaar ke pratimaano kaa gyaan praapt karke unako upyukt nirdesan de saktaa he
 According to Good and Hat - "A questionnaire is generally a method of getting answers to literal questions, in which the person has to fill in the format himself
 is vidhi main prashnon ke uttar praapt karke samasya sambandhi tathy ekatra karnaa mukhya hota he
 a questionnaire is a schematic list of written questions
 isamen sambhavit uttaron ke liye yaa to sthaan rakhaa jaataa he yaa sambhavit uttar likhe rahete hai
 " is vidhi main vyaktiyon se bhent kar ke samasya sambandhi tathy ekatrit karnaa mukhya hota he
 Through this method, knowledge of the problems and qualities of a person is obtained
 isamen do vyaktiyon main aamane-saamne maukhik vaartalap hota he, jiske dwaara vyakti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane tathaa shaareerik or maansik dashaon kaa gyaan praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 In the words of Good and Hat - a serious conversation with an objective is the interview
 ‘‘purv nirdhaarit dashaon main maanav vyavhaar kaa adhyayan
 In the method, the user studies the behavior of a person in situations or environments they have set themselves or collects facts in relation to a problem
 ‘‘vyakti ke achetan man kaa adhyayan karke upachaar karnaa
 Through this method, a person's unconscious mind is studied, and information about his unquenchable desires is obtained
 taduparant un ichchhaaon kaa parishkar yaa margntikaran karke vyakti kaa upachaar kiya jaataa he or is prakaar iske vyavhaar ko uttam banane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he Kiranjit Ahluwalia is a British woman of Indian origin

 Sergey Brin was born into a Jewish family in Moscow, whose parents are Eugenia Brin and Michael Brin, both of whom graduated from Moscow State University
 unke pita marilland vishvavidhyalay main ganit ke ek professor hai or unki mata nasa ke godard spes flite centre par ek anusandhan vaigyanik hai
 In 1979, when Brin was six, his family was forced to settle in the United States

 He learned how, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw, Poland, in 1977, he declared that this was the right time for the family to emigrate
 unhone apni patni or maa se kaha "ham yahaan or nahin rah sakate

 During this time, his parents understood the responsibility of paying attention to him and his father himself taught computer programming
 In May 1979, he received an official withdrawal visa and was allowed to leave the country
 oktober 2000 main ek saakshaatkaar main, brin ne kaha, "main kathin samay se parichit hum jaisaa ki mere pita is daur se gujarey hai or iske liye main bahut abhaari hum ki mujhe is desh main laayaa gaya
 "A decade ago, in the summer of 1990, a few weeks before his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school mathematics students, including Sergey, as part of a two-week exchange program for the Soviet Union
 "jaisaa ki sargi yaad karte hai, is yatra ne shashan ke prati unke bachapan ke bhay ko jaagrit kar diya tha" or ve yaad karte hai ki "soviet utpeedan ke khilaaf jo pehali pratikriya unhone kii thi vah thi ek police car par pathar phenkna
