 It was the first ruling dynasty in the known history of ancient Iran to have acquired sovereignty over almost the whole of present-day Iran and moreover, during its peak it ran from Greece in the west to the Indus River in the east and from the Caspian Sea in the north to the south
 Had spread to the Arabian Sea
 itnaa bada samrajya iske baad bas saasaani shaasha hi sthapit kar paae the
 The decline of this dynasty occurred in AD 330 BC after the invasion of Alexander, after which Greek dominion was established over its territories

 Iran sees this empire of ancient Iran as his glorious past, before the Arabs established rule and influence over Iran
 aaj bhi irani apane naam is kaal ke shaskaon ke naam par rakhte hai jo muslim naam nahin maane jate hai
 This dynasty is also considered a symbol of the royal form of Zoroastrianism due to the influence of Zardoshta

 According to Shrimad Bhagwat and Vishnu Purana, the entire Kurukshetra is known as Kuru Raja in the generation of King Ajmiad of Brahma's lineage
 kuru ek atyant pratapi raja hue hai jo mahabharat main kauravon ke pitamah the, unhi ke naam se kuru pracheen bharat ke 16 mahajanapadon main se ek tha
 Its area was around modern Haryana
 isaki rajdhani sambhawatah hastinapur yaa indraprastha thi
 The extent of the expansion of the kingdom of Kuru must have been a matter of discovery for Indians, but in world history, Kuru was the Chakravarti king who gave new dimensions to the largest empire of the ancient world, while transferring the Med empire in Iran from his own maternal grandfather Astyagus
 The empire was renamed Ajmeedh Achaemenid_empire empire
 is samrajya kii simaayen bharat se mishra, libya or greek tak faili hui thi
 The ruler of the Hakhamani i

 the Hakhamanash dynasty was the ruler of a small state called Anshan from the seventh century onwards centered in modern Southwestern Iran's Pars province

 When Kuru became hereditary king of Anshan in 559 BCE, he refused to accept the Mead dominance and revolted against the Mead empire
 usne isapurv 549 main maid raja astyagas kii rajdhani hamaadaan par adhikaar kar liya
 He declared himself the King of Paras and made the Mead Empire his ally

 usne pashchim kii disha main ledia par adhikaar kar liya
 There he also looted the wealth of the famous Croesus for his treasures
 iske alaava asia miner ke ilaakon par or babylonia par bhi usne adhikaar kar liya
 Kurosh gave religious freedom to the Jews
 lekin kuru kii mrityu uske jivan itani garimamayi nahin rahi
 In the latter part of his life, when he returned from the western side of the Caspian Sea and set out for a victory expedition, he was defeated and killed by the queen of Messagete there
 lekin us samay tak kurosh ne ek vishaal samrajya khadaa kar diya tha
 From the Greek cities to the Caspian Sea in the Middle East and along the coast of Turkey, hardly anyone in the world has stood up to that time

 He died unexpectedly

 An inscription found near Bisitun in western Iran states that a Magi named Gaumata revolted
 usne apane ko kambojia kaa chota bhai bataakar farsi janata par pade karon ke khilaaf logon ko bhadakaayaa tha
 It was true that during the time of Kurosh and Kambojia, the Iranian people had fought a lot of battles and the expenditure came from taxes imposed on the people
 par iske kuch hi dinon baat daara ne gaumata ko maar diya or shah ban baitha
 He later inscribed the events of those days in Bisitun

 With this intention, he launched an attack on the coastal regions of Anatolia

 Now Alexander entered Turkey directly

 But the kingdom of Dara had become very large by that time and Alexander's victory with a defeat cannot be assured

 Dara fled the battlefield and the Yavans took control of the Persian army
