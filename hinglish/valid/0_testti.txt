 It is a plateau area
 arabi bhashaa main 'najd' kaa matlab unchaa kshetra hota he or yah naam arabi prayadweep ke bahut se unche kshetron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha
 But the most well-known of these is the terrain between this peninsula with Hijaz and Yemen mountains to the west, Bahrain's historic area to the east and Iraq and Syria to the north
 madhyakaalin muslim bhugolashastri hijaaz or najd pradeshon ke bich kii seemaa par bahut vivaad kiya karte the lekin aamtaur par yah sarhad vahiin samajhi jaati he jahaan pashchimi pahaad or lava kii chattaane purv kii ore dhalaan shuru karti hai
 The eastern outskirts of Najd are believed to be in the red sand dunes of the al-dahna Desert, which are 100 km east of the modern city of Riyadh
 najd kii dakshin seemaa rub al-khaali ke registan main maani jaati he
 There has always been a disagreement over the northern border of Najd
 islam ke shuru hone par yah furaat nadi ke paas maani jaati thi jahaan iran ke saasaani samrajya ne apane rajya kii suraksha kii koshish karte hue iraq or arabi prayadweep ke bich 'khusro kii deevaaren' banavaai thi
 In modern usage, the area of 'al-yamama' is considered part of Najd, although in earlier times it was considered outside Najd
 najd ke pathaar kii oonchaai 700 meter se 1,400 meter tak he
 The entire plateau has a slight slope from west to east
 yah pathaar atipracheen yug main jwalamukhiyon se ugale gaye jame hue lava kaa bana he, jisamen jagah-jagah par ret ekatrit he
 Its eastern part, which is called al-yamama, contains many oasis where agriculture and trade is carried out, while the western part is more dry and the nomadic Baduin people live there
 najd kii kuch mukhya bhugolic chizein is prakaar hai: Many villages and villages in the Najd region are inhabited by these dry plains because the water of occasional rains can be saved in these extremely dry environments
 bhuvaigyanik sochate hai ki yah vaadiyaan vastav main un atipracheen nadiyon ke farsh hai jo kabhi is puure kshetra main baha karti thi lekin jo ab, kabhi-kabhi baari varsha hone se panigrast hone ke alaava, salbhar sukhi hi rahati hai
 Najd is historically divided into provinces
 har praant qasbon, bastiyon or gaavon kaa chota sa samooh hota tha jisamen se ek rajdhani hua karti thi
 Each province had its own accent of speaking the Najdi dialect, and each province had certain customs
 in praanton main kuch prasiddh praant is prakaar the: In modern Saudi Arabia, Najd is reorganized and divided into three provinces: Haile, al-qassim and Riyadh
 in teen praanton main samilit najd kaa kul ilaaka 554,000 varg kimi he 
 Riyadh is the largest city of Najd and in the whole of Saudi Arabia and in 2009 there lived about 47 lakh people
 kisi bhugolic kshetra yaa jan samooh par satta yaa prabhutv ke sampoorn niyantran par anany adhikaar ko samprabhutaa kaha jaataa he
 The sovereign is the highest lawmaker and controller, that is, sovereignty is the supreme power of the state
 europe main aadhunik rajya ke udai ke parinamswaroop satrahavin sadi main 'samprabhutaa' kii avadharana kaa janm hua
 In European Europe, the power in European kingdoms and empires was divided between the king, the pope and the feudal lords
 pandrahavin or solahavin sadi main samantvaad ke tirohit hone or udhar protestant mat ke ubhaar ke kaaran catholic carch kii manyata main hraas hone se samprabhu rajyon ko panpane kaa mauka mila
 Sovereignty means 'total and unlimited power'
 lekin iske nihitarth itane sahaj nahin hai
 Just by this meaning it is not known what is involved in the structure of this entire power
 Does it mean any supreme statutory authority or is it related to a political power that cannot be challenged? samprabhutaa ke arth sambandhi isi tarah ke vivaadon ke kaaran unnisvin sadi se hi ise do bhaagon main baant kar samajha jaataa rahaa he : vidhik samprabhutaa or raajnneetik samprabhutaa
 This concept is also practically accepted as internal sovereignty and external sovereignty
 samprabhutaa ke aantarik sanskaran kaa matlab he rajya ke bheetar hone vaale satta ke bantwaare main yani raajnneetik pranali ke bheetar sarvocch satta kaa mukaam
 External version refers to the ability of the state to remain active as an independent and autonomous entity under the international system
 samprabhutaa kii avadharana aadhunik raashtra or rashtrawaad ke aadhaar main bhi nihit he
 Without the mixed influence of ideas of national independence, self-rule and sovereignty, one cannot imagine the process of de-colonization under which new nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America grew up largely after World War II
 Was created vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa ke bich antar kaa ek bauddhik itihaas he jise samajhane ke liye jyaan bodaan or thomas hobbs ke tatsambandhit matbhedon par nazar daalani hogi
 Bodan, in his work The Six Books of Commonwealth, argues in favor of a sovereign who makes laws himself, but places himself above those laws
 is vichaar ke mutabik kanoon kaa arth he logon ko samprabhu ke aadesh par chalaanaa
 This does not mean that Boda wanted to advocate an autocratic ruler here
 unki manyata thi ki kanoon banane or unka anupaalan karaane vaala samprabhu shaasha ek ucchtar kanoon ke adheen rahegaa
 That is, the seal of divine law will be necessary on the authority of the temporal ruler
 bodaan ke is vichaar ke vipareet hobbs apni rachana levaythan main samprabhutaa ke vichaar kii vyakhya praadhikaar ke sandarbh main na karke satta ke sandarbh main karte hai
 Prior to Hobbes, St
 Augustine stressed the need for a sovereign who would control the moral evils inherent in humanity
 isi tark kaa or vikaas karte hue hobbs ne samprabhutaa ko damankaaree satta par ekadhikaar ke rup main paribhaashit karte hue sifaarish kii ki yah takat akele shaasha ke haath main honi chahie
 Although Hobbes preferred uninterrupted monarchy, he was also willing to believe that it could be in the hands of a small faction of rulers or a democratic assembly
 bodaan or hobbs ke bich kii yah bahes bataati he ki vidhik samprabhutaa rajya ke kanoon ko sarvopari maanane par tiki hui he
 In contrast, political sovereignty is linked to the actual distribution of power
 is fark ke baavjood yah bhi maananaa padegaa ki samprabhutaa kii vyaavhaarik dharna main vidhik pahalu bhi hote hai or raajnneetik bhi
 The sovereignty of modern states is also dependent on the supremacy of the law and on the power system that complies with the law, which has a repressive machinery
 koi bhi kanoon mahaz naitik baadhyataaon ke dam par lagu nahin hota
 It cannot be sustained without a system of punishment, police, jails and courts
 vidhik or raajnneetik samprabhutaa kaa yah sameekaran donon taraf se kargar hota dikhaai detaa he
 If the law requires a system of power for its compliance, then the power requires the recommendation of the law for its legitimacy
 shashan ko kanoonsammat or samvidhansammat hona padataa he, tabhi uski vaidhata kaayam rah paati he
 Only dictatorial governments work on the basis of political sovereignty
 agar sarkaar loktantric he to uski damankaaree mashinari ko kanoon kii simaaon main rah kar adaalaton ke sammukh javabdeh rahanaa padataa he
 The question of the internal nature of sovereignty has been much debated in the realm of political theory
 akhir sarvocch or aseemit satta kaa mukaam kya hona chahie? kya use kisi ek shaasha ke haath main rakhaa janaa shreyaskar hoga yaa uskaa centre kisi pratinidhitvamoolak sanstha main nihit hona behatar hoga? satrahavin sadi main frans ke samraat lui chaudaaven ne darp se kaha tha ki main hi rajya hoon
 The rationale behind giving sovereignty in the hands of a person is that in that case sovereignty will be guaranteed to be inseparable
 uski abhivyakti ek hi awaz main hogi or usamen koi doosraa praadhikaar hastkshep nahin kar paayegaa
 Effective interference in this totalitarian notion of sovereignty was done in the eighteenth century when jean-jacques Rousseau introduced the concept of popular sovereignty
 ruso ne rajshahi kii hukumat ko kaarij karte hue apni rachana soshal kantrect main likhaa : ‘manushya swatantra paidaa hota he, par har jagah vah zanjiron main jakadaaa hua he
 In fact, the social contract gives a new form to modern political philosophy
 unka saamaajik samjhauta hobbs or lock ke saamaajik samjhaute se alag he
 Philosophers prior to Rousseau believed that humans are different from other beings because of their intellectual abilities, while Rousseau believes that humans are different because of their ability to make moral choices
 agar use yah chunaav karne kii azaadi na di jaae to vah das se adhik kuch nahin rah jayega
 Since society is full of various freedoms, and man cannot return to the early world of his natural freedom, Rousseau suggests that he should exchange that freedom with civil liberties
 iske liye manushya ko ek-duusare se mil kar sanghathan bananaa hoga, saamaajik astitv rachana hoga jiske tahat sabhi log apane adhikaar tyaag denge or badale main naagarik ke rup main adhikaar praapt karenge, ek samprabhu ke sadsy ke rup main rahenge
 That is, a constitution will have to be made, under which every person will be subject and also a participating citizen
 keval isi tarah swatantraaa kii guarantee kii ja sakegi
 This was the concept of democracy, but the Russo did not agree with democracy or law-making run by the representatives of the people
 pracheen yunaan ke pratyaksh loktantr kii tarah ruso chaahate the ki sabhi naagarik ek saarvajanik sthaan par jamaa ho kar vidhi nirmaan karen
 To save the minority from being subject to the decision taken by the majority, Rousseau favored a consensus which formulated his most well-known principle 'public will' to make it effective
 ‘jan-ichha’ ke aadhaar par rache gayi kanoon ke paalan kaa matlab tha swayan apni ichha kaa paalan karnaa
 The principle of 'public will' introduced by Russo later became the basis of modern democratic theory
 ruso ne aise nagarikon ke sahaj samudaay kalpana kii thi jo oonch- neech ke sambandhon se pare samanta or ekta ke vaahak honge, isliye unhen vishwaas tha ki unke bich main ‘jan-ichha’ uplabdh karnaa aasaan hoga
 But Rousseau could never answer the question of how the 'journal-will' would come out of the wishes expressed in the general assembly of citizens
 isliye ant main ve yah kehete hue nazar aaye ki agar ‘jan- ichha’ nahin uplabdh ho paa rahi he to bahumat kii ichha ko hi uskaa paryaay maan liya janaa chahie
 The principle of sovereignty has also been taken up by the advocates of liberal-democratic thought
 unka kahana he ki bahultavaadi or loktantric shashan ke sandarbh main samprabhutaa kii dharna anaavashyak he
 These people consider the idea of sovereignty as suffering from its totalitarian past and therefore undesirable
 unka kahana he ki loktantric sarkarein damankaaree mashinari dwaara thope jane vaale kathith rup se vidhisammat shashan dwaara nahin chalatin
 They rule through an equation of control and balance and a network based on it
 darasal, sanghatmak charitra vaale aadhunik rajyon main aantarik samprabhutaa kaa centre tay karnaa bahut mushkil he
 In federal states such as the United States, Canada, Australia and India, the government is divided into two levels and each level has its own autonomous powers
 is prakaar ke rajyon main samprabhutaa centre or paridhi ke bich saajhedaari ke rup main ubhartee he
 In such a situation, if there is an undivided sovereign then it is the constitution which makes the center also sovereign and the states as well
 bahya samprabhutaa antarrashtriya vyavastha main kisi rajya kii haisiyat kii dyotak he
 There are also situations that the internal sovereignty of a state continues to be disputed, but its external sovereignty is respected in the international arena
 vaise bhi loktantron ke yug main aantarik samprabhutaa ke masale ab itane zyaada ahm nahin maane jate, par bahya samprabhutaa kaa prashn pehle se kahin zyaada mahatvapurn ho chukaa he
 There are many international disputes in which the claim of sovereignty of one country is seen as a challenge to its sovereignty from another country
 philistiniyon dwaara apane samprabhu raashtra ke liye chalaaya jane vaala andolan isroyal ko apni samprabhutaa ke kshay kaa kaarak lagata he

 Soon after its release, Nightwish went through what is described as one of its toughest conditions as a band
 samasya zyaadaatar basist sami vanska se hui, jine band ke saath durvyavhaar shuru kiya jaise niyat samay par na aana tathaa gigs ke gambhirtha se na lenaa jaisaa baaki log karte the
 His dealings with Wanska were discussed by the band several times, but without a change everyone stopped worrying and the tension increased
 Meanwhile, guitarist Empu Vorinen began complaining about her role in the band, thinking she was "a hired pony who has to do everything"
 According to his music teacher Plamen Dimov, he and Holopainen are completely different individuals and were expected to encounter difficulties of this type
 lekin vorinen ko shant rahane tathaa "gussa thunkane" ke liye kaha gaya or yah samasya phir kabhi nahin ai
 At the same time, Holopainen began to think seriously about the breakdown of Nightwish
 After a gig in Russia, he sent a message to his fellow musician Tony Kakko of the metal band {1 Sonata Arctica { / 1} that he did not think he would have a band anymore and inquired about their plans for the next year
 After the last gig of Nightwish's tour of Over the Hills and Far Away in 2001, Holopainen called Drakar and Spinefarm and unofficially announced the end of Nightwish
 He told them that he could produce another album, but that he would never perform another show with the band
 The same message was also written on the band's message board
 aakhri gig ke turant baad holopanen nitevish ko samaapt karne par raahat mahasoos karne ke liye tony kakko ke saath ek saptaah ke hiking trip par lapland gaye, lekin durbhaagya se aisa nahin ho sakaa

 The documentary also features live music, exclusive footage of the 2003 Tarja singer Bit, found during Turunen's summer wedding, and there were also rumors that the band had disbanded

 yah holopanen dwaara likhaa gaya tha, lekin anya teen band ke sadasyon dwaara hastakshar kiye gaye
 The main argument in the letter for Turunen's dismissal was that the band felt that her husband Marcello Kabuli and her commercial interests had changed her attitude towards the band
 tourunen ne is ghatana ke liye do baar jawaab diya, finland or germany main ek press conference ke dauraan, usne yah kaha ki uski barkhaastagi uske liye ek aghat he tathaa use khat die jane se pehle use suchit nahin kiya gaya tha
 She felt that personal attacks on her husband were unfair and making the issue public was a "limitation of insensitivity"

 In response to this and other rumors, the band requested on their website that their fans should not trust any other source except the band for information about the new singer
 Other rumors also mentioned that Vibeck Stein, a former singer of the gothic metal band Tristania, would join Nightwish
 To avoid such speculation, the new singer was announced ahead of schedule, and on Tuesday 24 May, Annette Olzon, 35, of Sweden's lead singer, Allison Avenue, was announced to replace Turunen

 The Commonwealth Prajabhoomi or Commonwealth Territories, known in English as the Commonwealth Realm, are said to be the 16 universal nations of the Commonwealth of Nations, ruled by the same ruler, Queen Elizabeth II
 ye saare desh ek hi rajasatta, shaasha, rajpariwaar or uttaradhikaar kram ko saanjhaa karte hai
 The system began with the Statute of Westminster of 1931, by which the then Dominion of Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were granted equal or complete legal independence with equal members of the British Commonwealth
 She had gone
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad se, vishwa bhar main vistrut, british samrajya ke tamaam deshon ko ek dominian ke rup main swadhinata pradaan kar di gayi
 Some of which, despite being completely independent, maintained their loyalty to the monarchy, while some states refused to consider the British monarchy as the nominal head and declared themselves a republican state
 aaj, vishwa baahar main kul 16 aise rajya hai jo swayan ko maharani elizabeth dwitiya ke ek prajabhumi ke rup main pahchaan karavvate hai
 Under the British sovereign in the English language, these states are commonly known as Rialm, which is derived from the French word royum, a realme, a state, territory or territory over which a king / queen rules
 yahan yah jaananaa aavashyak he kii, united kingdom yaa rashtramandal yaa kisi bhi rashtramandal pradesh kii aadhikarik shabdaawalee main "realm" ek vaidhik yaa kanoonee shabd nahin he, arthath "realm" kii koi kanoonee paribhaasha nahin he
 Therefore, there is no obligation that these states under the British sovereign be addressed by any special name, nor does the term "realm" define any particular status of a state
 haalaanki, 1950 ke dashak se hi, british samprabhu ke raaj ke adheen aanevaale rajyon ko rashtramandal ke anya sadsy deshon se vibhakt rup se bodh karne hetu "realm" shabd kaa upyog adhikaarak dastavezon main kiya jaataa rahaa he, yahan tak kii rani elizabeth ke rajasidhaaran kii ghoshnaa main bhi is shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These states are called realms because, despite being under the same ruler, all these states are completely universal, and completely independent from each other, so it is not part of 16 countries, one political unit, but 16 There are different states
 kyonki, reyalm ek kanoonee shabd nahin he, isiilie iskaa koi aadhikarik anuwaad bhi upasthit nahin he
 Therefore, to understand these states, any word that makes sense of the land under a king can be used
 saadhaaran taurapar, prajabhumi, pradesh, or paribhumi jaise shabdon kaa prayog hota he, inke alaava, pramandal or rajbhumi shabdon kaabhi upyog ho saktaa he
 According to the present situation, since the year 1992, there are a total of 16 Commonwealth tribes in the world, with a total area of 1,87,00,000 square kilometers, and a population of 14,30,00,000
 jisame se 6 sabase adhik aabaad desh hai:united kingdom, canda, australia, newzealand or jamaica
 The system of Rajmukut or The Crown is a special political concept, which has a very important role in the legal and political system of Britain and other Commonwealth territories
 is soch kaa vikaas england rajya main samantvaadi kaal ke dauraan shabdic mukut tathaa rashtriya sampadaaon ko samprabhu tathaa unke / unki vyaktigat sampatti se vibhakt kar sambodhit karne hetu hua tha
 According to this view, the Rajmukut is seen as a symbol of state and governance in all aspects of administration and in every dimension, and the British sovereign is seen as a continuous incarnation of the Rajmukut
 atah britain tathaa rashtramandal pradeshon me is shabdaawalee ko shashan athwa sarkaar ke liye ek upalakshan ke rup main bhi upyog kiya jaataa he, yaa sidhe-sidhe aisa bhi kaha ja saktaa he kii yah rajtantr ko hi sambodhit karne kaa ek doosraa tarika he
 Legally, "rajmukut" can be defined as an individual institution which is the entire judicial embodiment of the legislature, executive and judiciary
 atah is sandarbh main is shabd ko kisi shahi poshaak ke vaastavik mukut ke saath sambhramit nahin karnaa chahie
 As an institution, the Rajmukut is the oldest functioning institution in Britain's political system
 prayek rashtramandal pradesh main rajmukut kii sankalpana saamaan, parantu vibhakt vidhik sankalpanaayen hai
 Therefore, in Commonwealth law, judicial documents to distinguish one jurisdiction from another, "crown the right 


" Example: "the Crown in right of the United Kingdom 


" or "la Couronne du chef du Québec "also the Crown in right of Canada, The Crown in right of Australia, The Crown in right of Papua New Guinea, etc
, and because, Canada and Australia are federal nations, so each Canadian province and Australian state" Rajmukut "
 mukut ke adhikaron ko yaa adhirat dwaara swayan yaa phir unke pratinidhi dwaara, sambandhit mantriyon yaa adhikariyon kii salaah par prayog kiya jaataa he
 The relationship between Commonwealth territories is such that any bidding that disciplines succession requires the unanimous approval of all countries
 yah baadhyataa westminster kii sanvidhi, 1931 dwaara lagu kii gayi thi
 Succession over the throne is disciplined by various historical constitutions, including the Bill of Rights, 1689, the Act of Settlement, 1701 and the Act of Union, 1707
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Rules relating to succession can only be changed by a parliamentary act, no successor of the throne can voluntarily relinquish his succession
 singhasana par virajman hone ke pashchaat ek vyakti apane nidhan tak raaj karata he
 The only voluntary resignation in history was by Edward VIII in 1936, which was legalized by a special Act of Parliament
 antim baar jab kisi shaasha ko anaichhik rup se nishkashit kiya gaya tha, wo tha 1688 main james saptam or dwitiya jinhen glorious revolution ke samay nishkashit kiya gaya tha
 The Act of Settlement, 1701, limits the succession to the legally Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I
 atah rajpariwaar kaa koi bhi catholic sadsy kabhi bhi singhasana ko uttaridhikrut nahin kar saktaa he
 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid
 atah aam taur par rajbhishek uttaradhikaar ke kuch maheene baad hota he
 The coronation of the new ruler is practiced by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Westminster Abbey
 aitihaasik rup se uttaradhikaar ko purush-variyati sajaateey jyeshthadhikaar ke siddhanth dwaara anushaasit kiya jaataa rahaa he, jisame putron ko jyeshtha putriyon par praathamikta di jaati rahi he, tathaa ek hi ling ke jyeshtha santanon ko pehali praathamikta di jaati he
 Hence the gender and religion of the successor has a significant effect on succession

 To counter the increasing Chinese incursion into the disputed territory, India's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru asked for strategies to deal with them

 Nikolai Gogol was a Russian writer of Ukraine origin who has written well in the genres of story, short novel and drama, as per the requirements of the era
 gogol roosi sahitya main pragatisheel vichaardhaara ke aarambhik prayogkartaaon main pramukh the va unki saahitiyik praathamikta janonmukhataa kaa paryaay thi
 In the early writings, despite the excess of love element, Gogol very soon shifted towards the comprehensiveness and depth of multi-dimensional depiction of social life
 mirgorod main sankalit kahaniyaan is tathy kaa jeevant sakshya hai
 The poignant portrayal of anomalies and irony in compositions compiled in the stories of Petersburg is wonderful through humor and subtle satire; And their great feature is to influence the general public as well as an entire generation of writers

 Nikolai Gogol was born on March 20, 1809 in a family of landowners of Ukraine
 unke pita bhi uttam shiksha praapt vyakti the tathaa kavitaayen evam hasya bhi likhte the
 In addition, he also acted in theater
 apane pita ke in gunon ke kaaran gogol ko bachapan se sahitya ke saath-saath rangamanch ke prati bhi abhiruchi jag gayi
 While studying at the Gymnasium, Gogol also acted at the theater
 gogol kii shiksha ke samay gupt rup se abhijaat varg ke bich pragatisheel svachhndathawadi vichaaron kaa udai evam prasar bhi aarambh ho chukaa tha
 The Gymnasium also had a team of progressive teachers headed by Beloussov
 1820i0 main zaar sarkaar ke dwaara in par abhiyog lagaaya gaya tathaa isi sambandh main vidhyaarthee bhi bulaaye gayi
 At this time Gogol made a statement in favor of Belausov
 belausov ke vyakhyanon ke atirikt pushkin, rilyev tathaa anya pragativaadiyon kii rachanaaon ne bhi gogol ke pragatisheel drushtikon ke nirmaan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 In 1828, after finishing his gymnasium, Gogol moved to Petersburg
 petersburg jate hue gogol apana romantic kavy maas kukhel gartan bhi chipa kar le gayi the
 He wanted Pushkin's advice on this work, but it could not be possible and it was severely criticized after the publication of this work and as a result Gogol burnt all copies of it
 petersburg main aarambh main ve asafal hi rahe
 His desire to become an actor in the Alexandra theater was also not fulfilled and with great difficulty he got a small staff job in a department
 vahaan kaam karte hue vah shaam ko kala academy main jaaya karte the or chitrakala sikhte the
 In 1830, the first story of Gogol appeared before Ivan Kupal without an authoritative name

 On 20 May 1831, Gogol was introduced to Pushkin
 1831 i0 main gogol ke kahani sangrah dikanka ke paas gramin sandhyaayein kaa pehla bhaag prakashit hua tathaa 1832 i0 main iskaa doosraa bhaag niklaa
 The work was well received by the readers as well as critics

 isamen agle vakton ke jameendaar, taras bulba, evan evanovich kaa evan nickefrovich se jhagada jaisi prasiddh lambii kahaniyaan bhi sankalit thim
 The depiction of life in these stories is more extensive and deep and there is less love for folklore
 gogol ne in rachanaaon main jameendaaron ke maanviya evam parsparik prempurna charitra tathaa andruni jivan kii vidambnaaon evam khokhalepan -- donon pakshon kaa shashakt chithran kiya he
