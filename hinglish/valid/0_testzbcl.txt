 Geomorphology scientists try to understand what is the reason behind what the landscape looks like, they try to find out the history and dynamics of the landforms and to explore land observations, physical tests and numerical modeling
 Forecast future changes through a combination
 bhu-akruti vigyaan kaa adhyayan bhugol, bhuvigyaan, bhuganit, ejineering bhuvigyaan, puraatatv or bhu-takneekee ejineering main kiya jaataa he or ruchi kaa yah vyapak aadhaar is vishay ke tahat anusandhan style or ruchiyon kii vyapak vividhta ko utpann karata he
 The Earth's surface develops in response to a combination of natural and anthropological processes, and responds with a balance between the processes that add and remove materials
 aisi prakriyaayein sthaan or samay ke vibhinn paimaanon par kaary kar sakati hai
 On the broadest scale, the landscape is formed through tectonic uplift and volcanoes

 On a progressively smaller scale, a similar concept applies, where unit landforms evolve in response to the balance of additive and subtraction processes

 Geomorphic processes are influenced by tectonics, climate, ecology, and human activities, and equally many of these factors may be influenced by ongoing development on the Earth's surface, for example, through isostasis or mountain precipitation

 This section provides a brief outline of some of the major figures and events of their development
 bahujna chini vaigyanik or rajaneta shen kuo bhu-akruti vigyaan kaa ek siddhant khojane vaala shaayad sabase praarambhik vyakti tha
 It is based on his observation of a marine fossil shell in a geological layer of a mountain hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean

 He concluded that the land was reorganized differently due to soil erosion of the mountains and deposition of silt

 Furthermore, when he found the ancient vulcanised bamboo underground underground in the arid, northern climatic zone of Yanzhou, what is now modern-day Yanan, Zansi province, he proposed the theory of gradual climate change over the course of several centuries

 When mcgee used the term at the International Geological Conference of 1891, it became common usage in English, German and French
 ek aarambhik lokapriy bhu-akritik model bhugolic chakra yaa kataav kaa chakra tha jise 1884 or 1899 ke bich wiliam morris davis dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha
 This cycle was inspired by the principles of homogeneity that James Hutton first proposed
 ghati jaisi akritiyon ke sambandh main, ekarupathavaad ne is chakra ko aise anukram main chitrit kiya jisamen ek nadi kisi ghati ko adhik se adhik gaharaa katati he, lekin phir paksh ghaatiyon kaa kataav us ilaake ko antat punah samtal kar detaa he or oonchai ko kam kar detaa he, jiske baad utthan us chakra ko phir se shuru kar saktaa he
 Decades after Davis developed his theory, many studies of geomorphology attempted to fit his ideas into this mold for landscape development on a large scale, and are often referred to today as "davisian"
 davis ke vichaaron ko kaaphi had tak aaj paar kar liya gaya he, mukhya rup se unamem purvanumaan kshamta or gunatmak prakruti kii kami kii vajah se, lekin ve is vishay ke itihaas main ek atyant mahatvapurn vyakti bane hue hai
 In the 1920s, Walter Pank developed an alternative model to Davis's model, assuming that topographic evolution could be better defined as a balance between continuous processes of uplift and denudation, not Davis's single uplift
 As decay occurring after
 haalanki, apekshaakrit yuvavastha main hi uski asamyik mrityu kii vajah se, davis ke saath vivaad or unke kaaryon ke angreji anuwaad kii kami se unke vichaaron ko kai varshon tak vyapak manyata nahin mili
 These authors attempted to give the study of the evolution of the Earth's surface a more generalized, globally relevant basis than before
 19veen sadi ke aarmabhik kaal main, lekhakon ne - vishesh rup se europe main - bhu-akritiyon ke liye sthaneey jalwaayu ko shrey diya or vishesh rup se himachhadan or perigleshial prakriyaaon ko
 In contrast, Davis and Pank both attempted to emphasize the importance of landscape development over time and the generality of Earth's surface processes over different landscapes under different conditions
 jabaki penk or davis or unke anuyaayi mukhyatah pashchimi europe main lekhan or adhyayan kar rahe the, bhu-akruti vigyaan kaa ek anya, mote taur par pruthak skool 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main sanyukt rajya america main viksit hua
 Following the pioneering works of Grove Carl Gilbert in the early 20th century, a group of natural scientists, geologists and hydraulic engineers, including Ralph Elgar Bagnold, John Hack, Luna Leopold, Thomas Medoc, and Arthur Stroller, on elements of landscape shapes Started research such as river and hill slopes, for which they arranged, direct, outperformed their aspects Ratmk took measurements and investigating the scaling of these measurements

 Particular important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include: aadhunik bhu-akruti vigyaan, paraspar sambandhit prakriyaaon ke maatraatmak vishleshan par kendrit he
 Modern advances in geochemistry, especially cosmochemistry, isotope geochemistry and fission track dating, have enabled us to first measure the rates at which geomorphic processes occur on a geologically relevant timeline
 usee samay, adhik sateek bhautik maapan takanic ke upyog se, jisamen shaamil he bhedatmak jeepies, duurastha rup mahasoos kiye gaye digital terren model or lager scanning takneekon ne in prakriyaaon ke hote hue unke parimann or adhyayan kii anumati di he
 Computer simulation and modeling can then be used to understand how these processes work together and over time
 bhugarbheey rup se praasangik adhikansh prakriyaaon ko yaa to apradankaree, sthaanantaran kaari mana ja saktaa he yaa phir donon kaa sangyojan
 jamaav prakriyaaon ko adhiktar avsaad-vigyaan ke kshetra ke bheetar mana jaataa he, lekin aksar bhu-akruti vigyaan ke hisse ke rup main bhi samajha jaataa he
 Weathering is the chemical and physical disintegration of Earth's material caused by contact with atmospheric or near surface agents
 sataha ke nazadik in parivartanon ke utpaadon ko baad main kataav ke vibhinn karkon dwaara dur le jaaya ja saktaa he
 The nature of the processes investigated by a geologist is strongly dependent on the landscape or topography involved in the investigation, and the interest of the time and length line
 haalanki, nimnlikhit gaiyr-vistrut suchi inamen se kuch ke saath jude bhudrishy tatwon kii ek jhalak pradaan karti he
 The primary surface processes responsible for most topographic forms include wind, wave, chemical dissolution, mass destruction, groundwater activity, surface water flow, ice action, tectonics, and volcanoes
 anya adhik gambhir bhu-akritik prakriyaaon main shaamil ho saktaa he perigleshial prakriyaayein, namak kii madhyasthata vaali kriya, yaa parloukik prabhaav
 Rivers and streams are not only carriers of water but also sediment
 pani, jab sataha par pravaahman rahata he, to vah talachhaton kaa istemaal karne main sakasham hota he or inhen neeche kii taraf baha le jaataa he, yaa to tal bhaar athwa prasupt bhaar ke rup main yaa phir vighatit bhaar ke rup main
 The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and the discharge of the river
 nadiyaan nae chattaanon kaa apradan karne or nae talachat banane main bhi sakasham hai, apane tal dwaara or aasapaas pahari dhalaanon ke saath yugman dwaara
 is tarah, nadiyon ko gaiyr-himandeey vaataavaran main bade paimaane ke bhudrishy ke liye aadhaar str kii sthapana karne ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Rivers are important sources of exposure to various landscape elements
 jab nadiyaan sthalakritiyon se hote hue pravaahit hoti hai, ve aam taur par aakaar main badi ho jaati hai or anya nadiyon ke saath mil jaati hai
 The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system and is often dendritic, but may also assume other forms depending on the underlying geology and local topography
 vaiudh prakriyaayein hawa kii gatividhi se sambandhit he or adhik vishisht rup se, prithvi kii sataha ko aakaar dene kii hava kii kshamta se
 hawaaen chizon kaa apradan, parivahan or jamaav kar sakati hai or ye hawaaen un kshetron main adhik prabhavi hoti hai jahaan vanaspati viral hote he or talachat kii paryaapt aapurti hoti he
 Although water and large flows use more material than air in most environments, aeration processes are important in dry environments, deserts
 mitti, regolyth or pathar, gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ke antargat rengte hue, ludhakte hue, behate hue, girte hue nichi kii taraf jate hai
 Such massive breakdowns occur on terrestrial and slopes and have been observed on Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan and Eeapetus
 pahaad ke dhalaanon par chal rahi prakriyaayein dhalaan ke sataha kii sansthiti ko badal sakati hai, jo badale main un prakriyaaon kii daron ko parivartit kar sakati he
 Slopes that deepen to a delicate state are able to quickly release large amounts of material, making the sloping process an important element of landscape in tectonically active areas
 prithvi par, jaivik prakriyaayein jaise ki khudaai yaa tree thro kuch dhalaani prakriyaaon kii daron ko nirdhaarit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai
 Glaciers, which are geographically limited, are effective factors for landscape change
 ghati main neeche kii taraf dhire-dhire jate barf kii gatividhi neeche kii chattan kaa gharshan karti he or use ukhaad detii he
 Friction produces fine sediment, called glacial flour
 himand ke samaapt ho jane ke baad uske dwaara parivahan kiye gaye malbe ko moren kaha jaataa he
 Glacial erosion is attributed to U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys formed by the river
 himand kii prakriya jis tarah se anya bhudrishy tatwon ke saath sampark karti he, vishesh rup se dhalaani or nadi kii prakriyaaon ke saath, vah plio-plistosin bhudrishy vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he or uske talachat kai oonchi pahari ke vaataavaran main milte hai
 Environments that have been snow-capped relatively recently but are no longer can still show higher landscape change rates than landscapes that have never been snow-capped
 gaiyr-himand bhu-akritik prakriyaayein jinhen tis par bhi purv himachhadan dwaara anukulit kiya gaya he unhen parahimanad prakriyaayein kaha jaataa he
 This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by the formation or melting of ice or frost
 bhu-akruti vigyaan par vivartanik prabhaav lakhon saal se lekar ek minute yaa usase kam ke paimaane kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 The effect of tectonics on the landscape largely depends on the design of the underlying rocky bedrock that governs what type of local morphology the tectonics will give
 bukamp, minuton ke andar, vistrut bhu-bhaag ko jalplavit kar sakate hai or ne ardrapradeshon ko janm de sakate hai
 Isostatic rebound can result in significant changes over hundreds or thousands of years and allows additional erosion of the mountain chain, as larger portions are removed from the chain and uplift of the tropics
 dirghakaalik plate vivartanik gatishiltaa, lakhon varshiya jeevankaal vaale orogenic katibandh, vishaal parvat maalaon ko ubharti he, jo nadi or pahari dhalaan kii ucch dar kii prakriyaaon kaa centre hoti he or is prakaar dirghakaalik avsaad utpaadan karti he
 Characteristics of deep crust dynamics, such as plumes and non-lamination of the lower lithosphere, are also believed to play an important role in the large-scale evolution of the Earth's topography in the long term
 donon hi isostacy ke madhyam se utthan ko prerit kar sakate hai, kyonki garam, kam ghanatv vaali papadi kii chattaane, dharti ke andar apekshaakrit thandi, adhik ghanatv vaali papadi kii chattaanon ko visthapit kar detii hai
 Volcanic and volcanic igneous processes can have a significant impact on geomorphology
 jwalamukhi kii ghatana bhu-drishy kaa navinikaran karti he or jameen kii puraani sataha ko lava or tephra se dhak detii he or piroclostic saamagree ko chodta he or nadiyon ko nae raaston par agrasar karti he
 The cone formed by detonation also creates substantial new topography, on which other surface processes can perform their work
 lava kii upsatahi gatividhi bhi bhu-akruti vigyaan main ek bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The melting below the surface can cause inflation and deflation of the ground surface and the partially molten crust layer beneath Tibet has been contributed to control the landscape of the Tibetan plateau spanning thousands of kilometers
 bhu-akritiyon ke saath jeevon kaa sampark yaa jaev-bhu-akritik prakriyaayein kai roopon kii ho sakati hai or shaayad sthaliy bhu-akritik pranali ke liye samgr rup se kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Biology can affect many geomorphic processes, ranging from biogeochemical processes that control chemical weathering to the effects of mechanical processes such as digging and tree throws on soil development and even global erosion rates
 It also involves controlling and modifying the climate through carbon dioxide balance
 sthaliy bhu-drishy jisamen satahi prakriyaaon main madhyasthata karne main jeev-vigyaan kii bhoomika ko nishchit rup se baahar rakhaa ja saktaa he, atyant durlabh hai, lekin ve anya grahon jaise mangal kii bhu-akruti vigyaan ko samajhane ke liye mahatvapurn jaankaree pradaan kar sakate hai
 Different spatial and temporal scales are dominated by different geomorphic processes
 iske alaava, jin paimaanon par prakriyaayein ghatit hoti hai, ve pratikriyaaon yaa duusare rup main bhu-drishy ke badlaav ko prerak baalo ke prati nirdhaarit kar sakati hai, jaise ki jalwaayu yaa vivartaniki
 These ideas are important for the study of geomorphology today

 The film begins with a group that stars Ajay, Sharma, Joginder and Iqbal
 yah ek aisa gut jo nakli sibiai adhikariyon kaa bhes dhar jagah-jagah red daalata hai or phir sara maal lekar ud jaataa he
 In one such raid, the fake CBI men get away with all the goods and the real policeman Ranveer Singh gets trapped
 ranvir ko jab is baat kaa ehsaas hota he ki use bevaqoof banaaya gaya he tab tak bahut der ho chuki hoti he
 Ranveer is suspended from his post for his negligence
 ranvir baar-baar ye kahata he ki uski koi galati nahin he lekin uski ek nahin suni jaati
 Then he resorts to the real CBI so that he can catch this fake CBI
 ranvir singh asli sibiai officer wasim se vaada karata he ki wo is nakli gut ko pakadaney main ji jaan laga degaa
 Meanwhile, Ajay and Sharma continue their raids by becoming fake CBI and are saved every time because those who fall in their house do not file a police complaint for fear that doing so will reveal the truth of their black money
 
 ajay or sharma ne milakar ek special 26 kii team banaai jisamen wasim ke bhi kuch log shaamil ho gayi
 Ranveer Singh somehow manages to locate Sharma
 sharma apana munh asli sibiai officer wasim ke aage khol detaa he or rote hue kahata he ki yah uski galtiyaan thi lekin ab vah kya kar saktaa he
 To capture Wasay Ajay tells him that if he wants to survive, he must now do as he had planned
 ajay or sharma special 26 kii team ko agle din kaa puraa kaarykram samajha dete hai
 Here Wasim approaches the jeweler where Special 26's team is about to raid
 vahaan se wo sab saamaan duusari jagah visthapit karvaa dete hai or nakli samaan rakhkar apane hi aadamiyon ko vahaan ke kramchariyon ke rup main niyukt kar detaa he
 Here Ajay and Sharma send their special 26 team to the jeweler's shop there on a special bus where there is raiding and advise them not to get off the bus till they reach there
 bas ke kaaphi der tak vahaan ruke rahane ke pashchaat pataa chalata he ki ajay or sharma ne us dukaan ko lut liya he jahaan wasim ne johari kii dukaan kaa saamaan rakhwaya tha

0 sanskaran tak nimnlikhit lipiyaan isamen shaamil kar lee gai hai: Zionism or totalism is the philosophical, religious or spiritual idea that the soul is not only in humans but also in all animals, flora, rocks, natural phenomena
 isse bhi aage jaakar kabhi-kabhi shabdon, naamon, upamaaon, rupakon aadi main bhi aatma ke astitv kii baat kahi jaati he
 The philosophy of totalitarianism is found mainly in tribal societies, but it is also found in Shinto and some sects of Hindus
 aatma, jeevatma yaa jeev ke vishay main manushyon main praaia: teen prakaar ke vishwaas yaa vichaar prachlit rahe hai
 Some people, like the followers of Charvak, believe nothing independent of bodies or separate beings or spirits
 unke anusaar chetana jad mastishk kii kriyaaon ke parinamswaroop usee prakaar utpann ho jaati he jis prakaar ki yakrut se pitt; vah kisi jeev yaa aatma naamak abhautik tatv yaa padaarth kaa gun yaa swaroop nahin
 Against this, in the view of some people, consciousness does not originate from material elements, but from physical substances, it is the quality of a unique soul or creature
 udhaaharan ke liye, jain vichaarkon ne jeevon ke swatantra astitv ko sweekaar karte hue jeev kii paribhaasha "chetnalakshano jeev:" in shabdon main kii he
 But not everyone who accepts the power of soul or organism is of a single opinion
 unhen sthool rup se do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 One is that only those who accept the existence of the soul only in humans and some high-ranking animals and secondly, not only in humans and animals, but also in insects, moths and plants, which others consider to be the root
 Believe in the existence of soul or organism
 maanvon ke isi prakaar ke vishwaas yaa vichaar ko sarvatmavaad naam diya jaataa he
 In logical language, animism is the principle according to which even the so-called root substances accept the existence of a non-physical element or power called soul or spirit and it is considered not only the basis of intellectual life of intellectual beings but also of physical or material actions
 
 jaisaa kathopanishad "yonimanye prapadyante shariratvaay dehin: sthanumanyenusyati yathakarm yathashrutam" ke is shruti se evam shrimadbhagwat ke "andeshu peshish tarushvanishchiteshu praano hi jeevamupadhavati tatra tatra " is shloke se tathaa shri umaswami ke tatwarthadhigmasutra ke "vanaspatyantanamekam" is vaakya se vidit hota he, bhartiya aastik vichaarak tathaa jain darshanik donon hi vanaspati aadi sthavar tathaa pruthivi aadi jangam jad padaarthon main bhi aatma kaa astitv maanate rahe hai
 Hence, he can be called a proponent of totalitarian thought
 vastut: vriksh, grah, upgrahadi achetan padaartho main bhi aatma yaa jeev kii satta par aasthaa rakhanevaale vyakti ab bhi sansar ke gayana aadi anek deshon main paae jate hai jo praaia: na keval pretatmaon kii, visheshtya apane mrit purvajon kii, apitu aisi atmaaon kii bhi puja karte hai jinhen ve yaa to kisi bhi sharir yaa vastu vishesh se sambandhit nahin samajhate yaa phir prakritik padaarthon ke adhishthata athwa abhimaani devataaon ke rup main sweekaar karte hai
 Most thinkers of the modern era understand the fundamental belief not only of multi-theism but also of the virtuous monotheism of good human beings and count it in the religion or philosophy of uncivilized or half-castes
 unke anusaar sarvatmavaad maanav kii ek avaigyanik aasthaa maatr he
 They consider it an intellectual attempt to explain the facts of the world; But only initial or immature efforts

 These are among the oldest religious texts of the world, whose sacred mantras are still read and heard with great faith and reverence

 The details of these texts known today as 'chaturveda' are as follows - vedon ko apaurushey mana jaataa he
 This knowledge is believed to have been received by the creator Brahmaji through the Shruti tradition from Viratpurush or from the cause
 inhen shruti bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he 'suna hua gyaan'
 Other Aryan texts are called Smriti, that is, Vedas, texts based on the intellectual intelligence or memory of human beings
 veda ke samgr bhaag ko mantra samhita, brahman, aaranyak, upanishad ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 The language used in these is called Vedic Sanskrit which is somewhat different from secular Sanskrit

 vaidic kaal main granthon kaa sancharan maukhik parampara dwaara kiya gaya tha, vistrut naimanik takneekon kii sahaayta se parishuddhta se sangrakshit kiya gaya tha
 The literary tradition can be traced back to the Vedic times following the rise of Buddhism in the Mauryan period, perhaps the earliest in the Kanva text of the Yajurveda of the 1st century BCE; However the oral tradition of transmission remained active
 vizel ne 1 sahastrabdi bisii ke ant main likhit vaidic granthon kii sambhaavna kaa suzav diya
 Some scholars such as Jack Goody state that "the Vedas are not the products of an oral society", basing this approach by comparing the discrepancies in the transmitted versions of literature from various oral societies such as Greek, Serbia and other cultures
 Focusing on, Vedic literature is very coherent and vast which was composed orally over generations, without being written
 haalanki, gaudi kehete hai, vaidic granthon kii ek likhit or maukhik parampara donon main shaamil hone kii sambhaavna he, ise "sakshartaa samaaj ke samanaantar utpaadon" kehete hai
 Due to the ephemeral nature of manuscript material, surviving manuscripts rarely cross the age of a few hundred years

 atah nishchit akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam vaale veda-mantron kii sangya 'rik' he
 Mantras, which do not have the letter number and foot and punctuation according to the rules of the verse, are called 'yajuha' and all the chants are lyrical, they are called 'sama'
 in teen prakaar kii shabd-prakaashan-shaileyon ke aadhaar par hi shaastra evam lok main veda ke liye ‘trayee’ shabd kaa bhi vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 The Yajurveda is a prose collection, so the verses of the Rigveda in this Yajurveda are recited as prose at the time of reading the Yajurveda
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke purv vedon ke ukt chaar vibhaag alag-alag nahin the
 At that time, Rik, Yajuh and Sama - in these three word-styles, a specific study of the collective word-amount was called Veda
 peeche jaakar veda ke samakaksh me atharv bhi salagn ho gaya, phir 'trayee' ke jagah 'chaturveda' kahalaane lage | guru ke rusht hone par jinhone sabhi vedon ko aditya se praapt kiya he un yajyavlky ne apni smriti me vedatrayee ke baad or puranon ke aage atharv ko sammilit kar bolaa vedanstharvpuranani iti 
 The present-day Vedas are four - but earlier they were the same
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar maane jate hai
 But these four together were considered to be a single 'veda Granth'
 lakshantah trayee hote huye bhi veda ek hi tha, phir usko charbhagame baanta gaya
 Due to the spread of hearing and memorization from generation to generation, the creator Brahmaji also has Shruti, Amnaya due to self-proof, Amauya due to self-attestation, and Apoorusheya, etc
, due to attaining the form of Aaurusheya Vani
 veda ke pathan-pathan ke kram main gurumukh se shravan evam yaad karne kaa veda ke sangrakshan evam safalataa kii drushti se atyant mahatva he
 For this reason Veda is also called "shruti"
 veda parishrampurvak abhyaas dwaara sangrakshniya he, is kaaran iskaa naam ‘'amnaay’' bhi he
 The Maharshiyans have created the Ashta deformity in the defense of Vedas - Jata Mala Shikha Rekha Dhwajo Dando Ratho Ghanah | Ashtau Deformity: Procto permutative Maharsay: || As a result of which, like ancient times, even today, there is chanting in the form of lust, long, stilted and sublime, unspoken vocal
 iske anusaar prayek shakha kii vaidic shabd-raashi kaa vargeekaran- upar varnit prayek veda ke chaar bhaag hote hai
 Apart from the first part of the mantra, the other three parts are not considered as Vedas, but such an idea has not been proved to be logical
 anadi vaidic parampara main mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad ek hi vedake chaar avyav he
 Overall the parts of the Vedas are: - upar ke chaaron khand veda hone par bhi kuch log keval 'samhita' ko hi veda maanate hai
 At the end of Dwaparyug, Shri Krishna Dvapayan Ved Vyasa ji had four divisions of that Veda keeping in view the use of Yagyushthan and taught these four divisions to four disciples
 ye hi chaar vibhaag rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda ke naam se prasiddh he
 The four disciples named Pal, Vaishampayan, Jaimini and Sumantu taught the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda respectively
 in chaar shishyon ne shakal aadi apane bhinn-bhinn shishyon ko padhaayaa
 Due to the propagation and preservation of the Vedas by these disciples under their own, they will be greatly expanded through the Vedic texts, Charan, Branch, Pratiksha and Anushaka
 The same preachers are famous by the name of sages
 purvokt chaar shishyone shurume jitne shishyonko anushravan karaayaa ve charansamuh kahalaaye | prayek charansamuhame bahutse shakha hote he
 And in this way Pratishakha, Anushakha etc
 became
 veda kii anek shakhaaen yani vyaakhyaan kaa tarika bataayi gayi hai
 According to the sage Patanjali's Mahabhashya, 21 of the Rigveda, 101 of Yajurveda, 1001 of Samaveda, 9 of Arthaveda have 1131 such branches, but today only 12 branches are available in the original texts
 veda kii prayek shakha kii vaidic shabdarashi chaar bhaagon main uplabdh he: 1
 samhita 2
 brahman 3
 aaranyak 4
 upanishad
 Some people consider the Samhita as Vedas
 shesh teen bhaag ko vedon ke vyakhya granth maanate hai
 In different branches, the original codes remain the same but there is a difference between the Aranyak and Brahmin texts
 kai mantra bhaag main bhi upanishad miltaa he jaisaa ki shuklayajurveda mantrabhagamen isavasyopanishad| puraane samay main jitani shakhaaen thi utani hi mantra, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad hote the |itani shakhaon ke babajud bhi aajkal kul 9 shakhaon ke hi granth milte hai
 In other branches, some mantras, some Brahmins, some Aranyakas and some Upanishads are found
 itane hi nahi adhik shakhaonke to upanishad hi paaya jaataa he ,tabhi to upanishad adhik milte hai
 The Vedic sages found the Vedas to be popular in public welfare
 nihsandeh jaisaa ki -:yathema vaachan kalyanimavadani janebhyah vaisaa hi veda hi yagnarthambhipravrita kalanupoorvyabhihitashch yagyah tasmadidan kalvidhanshastran yo jyotishan veda sa veda yagyam vedon kii pravritih janakalyan ke kaary me he
 The word Veda is formed by applying the suffix h to vid dhatu
 sanskrit grathon main vid gyane or vid laabhe jaise visheshnon se vid dhaatu se gyaan or laabh ke arth kaa bodh hota he
 The subjects of Vedas depend on their interpretation - topics like Agni, Yajna, Surya, Indra, Soma, Brahma, mana-atma, Jagatna, the qualities of substances, religion, couplets, meditation-yoga, Pran recurrently
 yajna main devtaa, dravya, uddeshy,or vidhi aadi viniyukt hote hai
 According to the texts, their description is as follows - rugveda ko chaaron vedon main sabase pracheen mana jaataa he
 It is divided in two ways
 pratham prakaar main ise 10 mandalon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Circles contain some hymns in Suktas, Suktas
 kul richaayen 10520 hai
 The Rigveda has 64 chapters in another way
 aath-aath adhyyon ko milakar ek ashtak banaaya gaya he
 There are eight such octaves in total
 phir prayek adhyay ko virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The number of classes is different in different chapters
 kul varg sankhya 2024 he
 Each class has some mantras
 sristi ke anek rahasyon kaa inamen udghaatan kiya gaya he
 Earlier it had 21 branches, but at present its branch branch is being promoted
 isamen gadhy or padya donon hi hai
 Yajna is the priority of karma
 pracheen kaal main isaki 101 shakhaaen thim parantu vartmaan main keval paanch shakhaaen hai - kathak, kapishthal, maitrayani, taittiriya, vaajasaneyi
 This Veda has two distinctions - Krishna Yajurveda and Shukla Yajurveda
 krishna yajurveda kaa sankalan maharishi veda vyas ne kiya he
 Its other name is also Taittiriya Samhita
 isamen mantra or brahman bhaag mishrit hai
 Shukla Yajurveda - It was given by Surya as a sermon to Yajnavalkya
 isamen 15 shakhaaen thim parantu vartmaan main madhyandin ko jise vaajasaneyi bhi kehete hai praapt hai
 It has 40 chapters, 303 anuvakas and 1975 mantras
 antim chalisvaan adhyay eshavasyopanishad he
 This is the lyrical book
 isamen gaan vidya kaa bhandar he, yah bhartiya sangeet kaa mul he
 The singing of the hymns is called Sama
 isaki 1001 shakhaaen thim
 But nowadays only three are prevalent - Kothumiya, Jaiminiya and Ranayaniya
 isko purvarchik or uttararchik main baanta gaya he
 There are four scandals in the predecessor - igneous scandal, andra scandal, Powman scandal and Aranya scandal
 chaaron kandon main kul 640 mantra hai
 Then there are 10 mantras of Mahanamanyarchik
 is prakaar purvarchik main kul 650 mantra hai
 There are six readers
 uttararchik ko 21 adhyyon main baanta gaya
 There are nine readers
 isamen kul 1225 mantra hai
 Thus the Samaveda has a total of 1875 mantras
 isamen adhiktar mantra rugveda se liye gaye hai
 It can also be called the originator of worship
 isamen ganit, vigyaan, ayurveda, samaaj shaastra, krishi vigyaan, aadi anek vishay varnit hai
 Some people also find mantra-tantra in it
 yah veda jahaan brahm gyaan kaa upadesh karata he, vahiin moksh kaa upaay bhi bataata he
 It is also called Brahma Veda
 isamen mukhya rup main atharvan or angiras rishiyon ke mantra hone ke kaaran atharv angiras bhi kehete hai
 It is divided into 20 kandas
 prayek kand main kai-kai sutara hai or sutron main mantra hai
 There are a total of 5977 mantras in this Veda
 isaki aajkal do shakhaaen shounik evam pippalad hi uplabdh hai
 The scholar of the Atharvaveda is the author of the four Vedas
 yajna main rugveda kaa hota devon kaa aahnan karata he, samaveda kaa udgaata samgaan karata he, yajurveda kaa adhvaryu dev:kotikarm kaa vitan karata he tathaa atharvaveda kaa brahm puure yajna karm par niyantran rakhata he
 Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharva Veda and Sthapatya Veda - These have been told by the Upveda Katyayana of the four Vedas respectively
 vedon ke sarvangin anushilan ke liye shiksha, kalp, vyakaran, nirukt, chand or jyotish ke granth hai jinhen 6 ang kehete hai
 Pratipadasutra, Anupada, Chandobhasha, Dharmashastra, Justice and Vaiseshika - These 6 views are also available
 upangon ke vishay is prakaar hai - In the Veda samhita, there are signs of chanting their high, medium, or slow musical vowels by placing standing and horizontal lines in the mantras
 inako udaatt, anudaatt fir swaarit ke naam se abhihit kiya gaya he
 These vowels have been in vogue since ancient times and Mahamuni Patanjali has included his main cardinal rules in his great language
 swaron ko adhik yaa nune rup se bole jane ke kaaran inke bhi do-do bhed ho jate hai
 Such as udatta-udattar, anuadatta-anudattar, swarika-swarittodatta
 inke alaave ek or swar mana gaya he - shruti - isamen teenon swaron kaa milan ho jaataa he
 Thus the total number of vowels becomes 7
 in saat swaron main bhi aapas main milane se swaron main bhed ho jaataa he jiske liye swar chihnon main kuch parivartan ho jaataa he
 Although many methods are used in the marking and typing of these vowels and there is not a single mode common in publisher-commentators, in most places a horizontal line below the letter for the approved and a vertical line above the letter for the vocal
 Is the rule
 udaatt kaa apana koi chihn nahin he
 Due to this problem in marking, many writer-publishers do not use vowel signs at all
 vaidic mantron main prayukt chand kai prakaar ke hai jinamein mukhya hai- According to this, the ritual of Vedokta Yajna is considered to be the main use of the words of Veda
 sristi ke armbh se hi yajna karne main saadharantaya mantroccharan kii style, mantrakshar evam karm-vidhi main vividhta rahi he
 It is due to this diversity that the branches of the Vedas have expanded
 yatha-rugveda kii 21 shakha, yajurveda kii 101 shakha, samaveda kii 1000 shakha or atharvaveda kii 9 shakha- is prakaar kul 1,131 shakhaayen hai
 This number is also mentioned by Maharishi Patanjali in his great language
 uparyukt 1,131 shakhaon main se vartmaan main keval 12 shakhaayen hi mul granthon main uplabdh haih- Out of the above 12 branches, only 6 branches have the learning style - Shakal, Taittariya, Madhyandini, Karma, Kauthum and Shaunak Shakha
 yah kahana bhi anupyukt nahin hoga ki anya shakhaon ke kuch or bhi granth uplabdh hai, kintu unase shakha kaa puraa parichay nahin mil saktaa evam bahut-si shakhaon ke to naam bhi uplabdh nahin hai
 As mentioned above, understanding of many words of Vedas has not been as simple
 vedunkaa vaastavik arth samajhane ke liye inke bhitarase hi vedangunka avishkaar kiya gaya | isaki vajah inamen varnit arthon ko janaa nahi ja saktaa | sabase adhik vivaad-vaarta ishwar ke swaroop, yani ekmaatr yaa anek devon ke sadrishy ko lekar hua he
 The real meaning of Vedoun can be done only by those who know the education - Kalpa, Grammar, Nirukta, Chanda and Astrology
 europe ke sanskrit vidwaanon kii vyakhya bhi hind-arya jati ke siddhant se prerit rahi he
 In the ancient times itself, many such opinions appeared, challenging their power, which are still called religious views but are different in many ways
 inkaa mukhya antar neeche spasht kiya gaya he
 Among them, who are guided by the Vedas, shakhas, and Kalpasutra, who believe in a unique universe, believe in the Vedas by not engaging in any one god, they believe in the Vedic Sanatana Varnashrama religion, they consider Vedon as Sarvopari
 iske alaava alag alag vichaar rakhanevaale or pruthak pruthak devtaa maanane vaale kuch sampradaay ye hai-: The topics which have been disputed are given below
 yajna:yajna ke vartmaan rup ke mahatv ko lekar kai vidwaanon, maton or bhashkaron main virodhabhash he
 The use of fire in the yajna has been so much similar to the ancient Parsi worship method and scholars have been interested in the immense importance of havan
 devtaa:dev shabd kaa lekar hi kai vidwaanon main asahmati rahi he
 The Vedokta Nirguna - formless and saguna - in many faiths who believe in the last aspect of the form, consider it to be a great person with special powers as a great man and worship them in idol, while many others call them the names of God
 paroapkaar karne vaali vastuen, vidwaan log or maargdarshan karne vaale mantron ko dev kaha gaya he
 For example, by not understanding the meaning of the word fire, first of all, that is to say, God
 devtaa shavd kaa arth divya, yani parameshwar kii shakti se purna mana jaataa he - jaise prithvi aadi
 Mahadev, in this view, calls God because he is the Lord of the Gods
 isi tarah sarvatra vyapak ishwar vishnu or satya hone ke kaaran brahma kehalaata he
 In this way, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev are not names of any character but names of God
 vyakaran or niruktake valpar hi vaidic or loukik shabdonke arth nirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 In the absence of this, they sit in the waste of meaning
 isi praakar ganesh, prajapati, devi, buddha, lakshmi ityadi parameshwar ke hi naam hai
 The Vedadi scriptures belong to the same God
 jaisaa kii upanishadonme kaha gaya he- eko dev sarvbhooteshu guiah sarvyaapee sarvabhootantaraatma | kuch log ishwarke sagun- nirgun swarupame jhagadte rahete he
 Some of them do idolatry and there are people who are against idolatry and consider God as the only truth, paramount
 ashwamedh:ashwamedh se hinsa or bali kaa vichaar aata he
 This is surprising to many Hindus as purists have been avoiding violence in many places
 kaiyon kaa maananaa he ki medh shabd main adhwaran kaa bhi prayog hua he jiskaa arth he ahimsa
 Therefore, there must have been some other meaning of merit
 isi prakaar ashv shabd kaa arth ghoda na rahakar shakti rahaa hoga
 According to Shri Ram Sharma Acharya languages, the word Ashwa means power, the word Gau means nutrition
 isse ashwamedh kaa arth ghode kaa bali se itar hoti prathit hoti he
 Som: Some people consider it to be wine, but according to many translations it was made by code-grinding

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
