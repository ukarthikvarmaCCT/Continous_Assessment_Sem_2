 From here he went to Farrukhabad city while he was on a journey from Sankisha to Kannauj
 yadi buddha kaal main hi nahin, to baad main yahaan buddha viharon, kaa aagaman hua
 The excavation work of Sankisha proves that many high-end buildings and religious places came here later, built by the Buddhist pilgrims
 sankisha bhi baudhon ke liye ek pavitra tirth sthali he
 Sankisha is also found in Panini's Ashtadhyayi
 chini yatri fahmavaan ne bhi is sthaan kaa ullekh kiya he
 Many Buddha statues were excavated from this place

 Collector - senge khabab yaa senge tsangpo tibet ke ngaari vibhaag main sthit ek nadi he jo mahaan sindhu nadi kaa strot bhi maani jaati he
 This river originates from the northern side of Mount Kailash
 1950 ke dashak main janavaadee ganatantr china ne tibet par niyantran kar liya or tab se chini sarkaar is nadi ko senge zangabo or shichuan nadi ke naamon se bhi bulaati he
 In Tibetan language, 'senghe bub' means 'lion mouth river', i
e
 the river originating from lion's mouth
 dhyaan den ki tibet va bharat kii bahut-si mahatvapurn nadiyon kii strot-dhaaraon ke naam hindu va buddha aasthaaon main dharmik mahatv rakhane vaale jaanwaron par pade hai: Wisdom is the mental power that helps in understanding things and facts, finding interrelations between them and gaining rational knowledge
 yah 'bhaavana' or antavpragna se alag he
 Wisdom helps man to understand and adapt to new situations properly
 buddhi ko 'soochna ke prasanskaran kii yogyata' kii tarah bhi samajha ja saktaa he
 Wisdom has been the subject of discussion in cognitive activities since ancient times
 kaha jaataa he ki, 'buddhiryasy balantsya' arthath jisamen buddhi he vahi balavaan he
 Human being is considered superior to other beings because of intelligence
 manovigyaan ke kshetra main bhi buddhi charchaa kaa vishay rahaa he
 Since thousands of years ago, people were divided into different classes on the basis of intelligence
 kuch vyakti budhimaan kehalaate hai, kuch kam buddhi ke, kuch mooth buddhi ke to kuch jad buddhi kehalaate hai
 But it is very difficult to understand the nature of intelligence
 buddhi ke swaroop par pracheen kaal se hi matbhed chale aa rahe hai tathaa aaj bhi manovaigyanikon tathaa shikshavidon ke liye bhi buddhi vaad-vivaad kaa vishay bana hua he
 From the latter part of the 19th century, psychologists started making efforts to understand the nature of the intellect, but they were not successful in it and could not give a unanimous definition of intelligence
 vartmaan main bhi buddhi ke swaroop ke sambandh main manovaigyanikon ke vichaaron main asamanta he
 Different psychologists defined the nature of intelligence differently
 manovaigyanikon ne buddhi kii paribhaashaon ko teen virgon main rakhaa he- The way the intellect is defined under these three classes is mentioned as follows: is prakaar kii vichaardhaara ko maanane vaale manovaigyanik terman, ambigas, staoot, bart galton stern aadi hai
 According to these psychologists, intelligence is the common ability of a person, which is found in every action
 in manovaigyanikon ne buddhi kii paribhaasha is prakaar prastut kii he- Therefore, according to Terman, intelligence is the ability to solve problems
 is prakaar kii vichaardhaara ko maanane waalon main stenford bine kaa naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey he
 According to Binay, intelligence is the ability and ability of reasoning, judgment and self-criticism
 buddhi ke is varg kii paribhaashaon ke antargat manovaigyanikon ne vibhinn prakaar kii vishisht yogyataon ke yoga ko buddhi kii sangya di he
 Those who hold these views are Thorndike, Thurston, Thomson, Wessler and Stoddard
 situations
) economy adaptations to a goal social value and commergence of originals under such conditions that demand aconcentration of energy and resistance to emotional forces
) buddhi ke swaroop evam buddhi ke siddhanth - donon hi buddhi ke vishay ke bare main vichaar prakat karte hai parantu phir bhi donon main bhinnata drushtigat hoti he
 The principles of the intellect make its structure clear while the forms throw light on its functions
 gat shatabdi ke pratham dashak se hi vibhinn deshon ke manovaigyanikon main is baat kii ruchi badi kii buddhi kii sanrachana kisi he tathaa isamen kin-kin karkon kaa samavesh he
 As a result of these questions, the structure of intelligence started to be explained on the basis of various factors
 america ke tharston, tharnadik, thomson aadi manovaigyanikon ne karkon ke aadhaar par 'buddhi ke swaroop' vishay main apane-apane vichaar vyakt kiye
 Similarly, Alfred Binne in France, Spearmen in Britain also presented their ideas about the nature of intelligence
 is siddhanth kaa pratipaadan france ke manovaigyanik alfred bine ne 1911 main kiya tathaa america ke manovaigyanik terman tathaa germany ke manovaigyanik ambigas ne iskaa samarthan kiya
 According to this theory, intelligence is the power that affects all mental functions
 is siddhanth ke anuyaayiyon ne buddhi ko samast maansik kaaryon ko prabhavit karne vaali ek shakti ke rup main mana he
 They have also believed that intelligence is a holistic form and leads a person to do a specific task
 yah ek ekatv kaa khand he jiskaa vibhaajan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 According to this theory, if a person is proficient in one particular area then he will be proficient in other areas also
 isi ek kaarkiya siddhanth ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bine ne buddhi ko vyakhya-nirnay kii yogyata mana he
 Terman considered this an ability to consider, and Stern considered it an ability to adjust to new circumstances
 is siddhanth ke pravartak britain ke prasiddh manovaigyanik spear main hai
 He proposed this two-element theory of intelligence based on his experimental studies and experiences
 unke matanusaar buddhi do shaktiyon ke rup main he yaa buddhi kii sanrachana main do kaarak hai
 He called one of these 'general intelligence' and the other factor as 'specific intelligence'
 saamaanya kaarak se unka taatpary yah he ki sabhi vyaktiyon main kaary karne kii ek saamaanya yogyata hoti he
 Therefore, each person can do some work to some extent
 ye kaary uski saamaanya buddhi ke kaaran hi hote hai
 Common factor is found in the whole mental and intellectual activities of a person, but it occurs in different quantities
 buddhi kaa yah saamaanya kaarak janmajaat hota he tathaa vyaktiyon ko safalataa kii ore ingit karata he
 The particular actions of a person are by a particular factor of intelligence
 yah kaarak buddhi kaa vishisht kaarak kehalaata he
 a specific factor of intelligence works in one type of specific action, then another specific factor in another action
 atah bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii vishisht kriyaaon main bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke vishisht karkon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 These specific factors vary from person to person
 isi kaaran vaiyaktik bhinnataayen pai jaati hai
 Common factors of intelligence are innate while specific factors are mostly acquired
 buddhi ke is do-kaarak siddhanth ke anusaar sabhi prakaar kii maansik kriyaaon main buddhi ke saamaanya kaarak kaary karte hai jabaki vishisht maansik kriyaaon main vishisht karkon ko swatantra rup se kaam main liya jaataa he
 a single action of a person requires one or several specific factors
 parantu prayek maansik kriya main us kriya se sambandhit vishisht kaarak ke saath-saath saamaanya kaarak bhi aavashyak hote hai
 For example, general factors are considered important for knowing and understanding subjects like general science, social studies, philosophy and science studies, while specific factors are mainly to know and understand specific subjects like mechanical, handicraft, art, music arts
 Is required
 isse spasht he ki kisi vishesh vishay yaa kala ko seekhney ke liye donon karkon kaa hona atyant anivaary he
 Spearman, in 1904, revised the doctrine of intelligence by amending the doctrinal principle of his former intellect and proposing the fundamental principle of intelligence
 buddhi ke jis tisare kaarak ko unhone apane siddhanth main joda use unhone 'samooh kaarak' kaha
 Therefore, there are three factors in this theory of intelligence - sammilit kiye gayi hai
 In Spearman's view, in addition to general and specific factors, group factors also co-exist in all mental activities
 kuch vishesh yogyataayen jaise yantric yogyata, aankik yogyata, shabdic yogyata, sangeet yogyata, smriti yogyata, taarkik yogyata tathaa bauddhik yogyata aadi ke sanchaalan main samooh kaarak bhi vishesh bhoomika nibhaate hai
 The group factor itself does not have an independent existence in itself, but rather it forms its own group with a mixture of various specific factors and common factors
 isiilie ise samooh kaarak kaha gaya he
 According to psychologists, there is no novelty in this theory
 tharnadike jaise manovaigyanikon ne is siddhanth kii aalochana karte hue kaha he ki samooh kaarak koi naveen kaarak nahin he apitu yah saamaanya evam vishisht karkon kaa mishran maatr he
 Thornadike in his theory considers intelligence to be a mixture of various factors
 jisamen kai yogyataayen nihit hoti hai
 According to him, for any mental function, various factors work together
 tharnadike ne purv siddhanton main prastut 'saamaanya karkon' kii aalochana kii or apane siddhanth main saamaanya karkon kii jagah mul karkon tathaa sarvanishtha karkon kaa ullekh kiya
 Basic factors include basic mental abilities
 ye yogyataayen jaise- shabdic yogyata, aankik yogyata, yantric yogyata, smriti yogyata, taarkik yogyata tathaa bhaashan dene kii yogyata aadi hai
 According to him these abilities affect all mental functions of a person
 tharnadike is baat ko bhi maanate hai ki har vyakti main koi na koi vishisht yogyata avashya paayi jaati he
 But he also believes that it is difficult to estimate one's ability from one subject to another
 jaise ki ek vyakti yantric kala main praveen he to yah aavashyak nahin ki vah sangeet main bhi nipun hoga
 According to him, when positive correlation is found in the rendering of two mental actions, then it also means that there are several factors in the person
 ye ubhaynishth kaarak kitni maatra main hai yah sahasambandh kii maatra se gyaat ho saktaa he
 According to Thurston's group factor theory, intelligence is neither the performance of common factors nor the various specific factors, but it has certain mental functions that are normally included in basic factors
 ye maansik kriyaayein samooh kaa nirmaan karti hai jo manovaigyanik evam kriyaatmak ekta pradaan karte hai
 Thurston presented his theory based on factor analysis
 unke anusaar buddhi kii sanrachana kuch moulik karkon ke samooh se hoti he
 Two or more basic factors combine to form a group that demonstrates a person's intelligence in a given area
 in moulik karkon main unhone aankik yogyata, pratyakshikaran kii yogyata, shabdic yogyata, daishik yogyata, shabd pravaah, tark shakti or smriti shakti ko mukhya mana
 Thurston made it clear that intelligence is a mixture of many types of abilities that are found in different groups
 unke anusaar maansik yogyataayen kriyaatmak rup se swatantra he phir bhi jab ye samooh main kaary karti he to unamem paraspar sambandh yaa samanta pai jaati he
 Some special abilities belong to the same group and there is correlation among them
 jaise vigyaan vishyon ke samooh main bhautik, rasayan, ganit tathaa jeev-vigyaan bhautikee evam rasayan aadi
 Similarly, there is a correlation between playing tabla, harmonium, sitar etc
 to showcase the musical art
 thomson ne buddhi ke pratidarsh siddhanth ko prastut kiya
 According to him, every work of a person is a reflection of certain abilities
 kisi bhi vishesh kaary ko karne main vyakti apni samast maansik yogyataon main se kuch kaa pratidarsh ke rup main chunaav kar letaa he
 In this theory, he has given importance to the practicality of common factors
 thomson ke anusaar vyakti kaa bauddhik vyavhaar anek swatantra yogyataon par nirbhar karata he parantu pariksha karte samay unka pratidarsh hi saamne aata he
 Raymond V
 Kettle describes two types of general intelligence
 ye hai flud tathaa crystallijd 
 According to him Fluid general merit of intelligence depends on hereditary factors while crystallized competence as earned factors
 flud saamaanya yogyata mukhya rup se samskruti yukt, gati-sthitiyon tathaa nai sthitiyon ke anukulata vaale pareekshanon main pai jaati he
 Crystallized general aptitude is measured as a factor in tests related to acquired cultural achievements, skills, and new status
 flud saamaanya yogyata ko sharir kii vanshanukram vibhakta ke rup main liya ja saktaa he jo jaivaracinic abhikriyaaon dwaara sanchalit hoti he
 While crystallized general competence is governed by social learning and environmental influences
 kettl ke anusaar flud saamaanya buddhi vanshanukram se sambindhat he tathaa janmajaat hoti he jabaki crystallijd saamaanya buddhi arjeet he
 Burt and Vernon proposed this theory
 buddhi siddhanton ke kshetra main yah naveen siddhanth mana jaataa he
 In this theory, Burt and Vernon have given gradual importance to mental abilities
 unhone maansik yogyataon ko do staron par vibhikt kiya- Even among the general mental abilities, he divided the abilities into two classes on the basis of levels
 pehle varg main unhone kriyaatmak, yantric evam shaareerik yogyataon ko rakhaa he
 He named this main square as km
 yogyataon ke duusare samooh main unhone shabdic, aankik tathaa shaikshik yogyataon ko rakhaa he or is samooh ko unhone v
ed
 naam diya he
 At the final level, he placed specific mental abilities that are related to various cognitive functions
 is siddhanth kii naveenta evam apni vishesh yogyataon ke kaaran kai manovaigyanikon kaa dhyaan isaki ore aakarshith hua he
 Guilford and his colleagues presented an explanation of intelligence structure based on three mental abilities
 gilford kaa yah buddhi sanrachana siddhanth tri-vimiya bauddhik model kehalaata he
 He has divided the intelligence factors into three categories, namely mental abilities into three dimensions
 ye hai- These three dimensions of intelligence differ substantially from factor analysis
 in sabake alaava buddhi kaa ek siddhanth he jise 'howard gardenar' ne pratipaadit kiya, ise bahubuddhi siddhanth kaha jaataa he
 According to this, every human being has a different type of intelligence, such as someone who can be proficient in music, someone in acting or writing, logical reasoning etc
 inhone buddhi ke is siddhanth ko samajhane ke liye ise aath kshetron me vibhajit kiya he jo is prakaar hai-1-bhashaagat2-taarkik-ganitiya3-deshik4-sangitatmak5-shaareerik-gatisanvedi6-antarvaiyaktik7-antah vyakti8-prakrutivaadee Gardner in his book "frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligence" explains it very well in detail
 tirhenian sagar yaa tirhenian sagar, bumadhya sagar kaa ek bhaag he, jiskaa vistaar italy ke pashchimi tat ke saath saath he
 The Italian peninsula is bounded on the north by the Tiruhanian Sea, on the west by the islands of Sardina and Corsica, in the east by Tuscany, Lazio, Compania and Calabria, and in the south by Sicily
 uttar main iskaa milan ligurian sagar se hota he jabaki dakshin main yah ionian sagar se miltaa he

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics
 in falon se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kii kasuti kaa kaam le sakate hai
 These three fruits are as follows: kasinthuni vishwanath bhartiya film nirdeshak hai jinhone telugu, tamil or hindi main kai prashansaneey filmein banaai hai

 Small 'I' and small 'A' represent their presence in every word which is a pulling or feminine, and is covered with an organism, and whatever word is nepusengling, they also present their gesture in this way, Big 'A' and Big 'E' provide the fullness of its power, the quantity of big 'A' and big 'E' work to add any word, the word 'rum' means, dissolved, And the quantity of big 'A' is the letter 'R' and 'I' The word 'rama', which is used to form 'rama' from the factor 'rum', is called 'ram Sethu'

55 Complete solar eclipse will have to wait for 115 years after 22 July --subeerin 07:30, 2 July 2009 Pankaj Subir 2 July 2009 12; 59 The full solar eclipse that is going to happen on 22 July is unique in many respects
 vartmaan peedi ke liye ise na bhuto na bhavishyati kaha ja saktaa he
 Because in the regions of Madhya Pradesh where this complete solar eclipse will be seen, never before in the history of two hundred years before it has seen a solar eclipse
 saath hi ye bhi ki aane waal ek sau pandraa saalon main bhi ab koi sambhaavna nahin he
 According to Pankaj Subir, the young litterateur of Sehore, who is working on a research book on the history of solar eclipses in India, the area of madhya Pradesh where this solar eclipse will appear as Khagrahas has not happened in the last known history in two hundred years
 
 yadi pichley 200 saalon ke itihaas par naar daalen to 1800 se lekar aaj tak bharat main kul gyaarah khagrass suryagrahan dikhaai diye hai
 17 July 1814, 19 November 1816, 21 December 1843, 18 August 1868, 12 December 1871, 22 January 1898, 21 August 1914, 30 June 1954, 16 February 1980, 24 October 1995 and 11 August 1999
 There are complete solar eclipses
 in saare suryagrahanon main se keval 1898, 1995 tathaa 1999 main hi aisa hua tha ki purna suryagrahan kii pattee madhyapradesh ko chhukar gujri thi lekin teenon hi avasaron par ye pattee madhyapradesh ke bich se hokar nahin gujri thi balki ek sire ko choote hue guzar gai thi
 On 22 January 1898, the strip of Khagraas solar eclipse passed through the area which is now Chhattisgarh
 24 oktober 1995 ko khagrass surya grahan main chandramaa kii purna chaaya bhind or muraina ko chooti hui gujri thi vahiin 11 agast 1999 ko ye badvani chhabua ko chooti hui nikali thi
 But this time, i
e
 on 22 July 2009, about two and a half kilometer wide strip of full solar eclipse is passing through the whole of Madhya Pradesh and Khargone, Khandwa, Dhar, Indore, Uun, Dewas, Sehore, Bhopal, Harda, Hoshangabad, Khandwa
 , Sagar, Shahdol, Damoh, Rewa, Satna, the shadow of the moon will pass through the sun completely in its grip
 chandramaa kii ye chaaya jis lagbhag dhai sau kilometre chaudee pattee se hokar niklegi usko teen bhaagon main baanta gaya he
 The outermost edge of both sides of the strip where this view will be visible for only one minute, the area inside where this view will be visible for two minutes and the central line inside which this amazing astronomical event in the surrounding areas will last for a full three minutes
 Will appear
 shri pankaj subir ke anusaar sihor, bhopal, indaur, reva, satna, hoshangabad, damoh suryagrahan kii isi sabase andruni pattee par hai
 Areas like Uaun Dewas, Khandwa Jabalpur are on the outskirts
 is kaaran se sihor, bhopal, indaur, reva jaise ilaakon kaa vaigyanik mahatv adhik he
 In that too, the cutlery has its own significance because it will remain exactly in the center of the shadow of the moon
 arthath prithvi se hokar jo chandramaa kii parachhai niklegi uskaa thik kendra bindu jin ilaakon se nikalegaa unamem murvaara bhi shaamil he
 The Central Line of Eclipse will pass through Murwara
 is kendriya rekha par gujarat kaa surat shahar bhi he
 In the eclipse, this central line also has its own importance for scientific experiments
 madhyapradesh ke liye ye grahan bahut mahatvapurn he kyonki chandramaa kii purna chaaya lagbhag samooche madhyapradesh ke bich se hokar nikal rahi he
 And areas like Bhopal, Indore, Uun, Sehore, which are going to witness the Khagraas solar eclipse, have been untouched by this astronomical event since 1800 till now in known history
 haa 1995 tathaa 1999 main kaaphi paas se hokar ye chaaya nikali thi
 According to Mr
 Subir, after this, these areas of Madhya Pradesh will have to wait for about 115 years again to become witness to this unique event
 kyonki iske baad 14 may 2124 ko lagbhag isi kshetra se hokar purna suryagrahan kii pattee gujaregi
 Although after this complete solar eclipse, a full solar eclipse will be seen in India on 20 March 2034 and 3 June 2114 but in 2034 it will be limited to only a few areas of Kashmir, whereas in 2114 Rajasthan will be seen in UP and Bengal
 is prakaar se ye suryagrahan madhyapradesh ke nivaasiyon ke liye na bhuto na bhavishyati hone ja rahaa he kyonki pichley do sau saalon main in ilaakon main purna suryagrahan nahin dikhaai diya he or aane vaale 115 saalon tak phir se koi sambhaavna nahin he
 Starting from Gujarat in the Arabian Sea, the shadow of the moon will leave the sun completely hidden behind it, passing through Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar towards China
 is anokhi khagoleey ko dekhne ke raste main jo sabase badi aadchan aa rahi he wo he mausam kii, kyonki 22 july ko barsaat kaa mausam hone ke kaaran badal rahane kii sambhavana rahegi
 However, the day of July 22 is special for the residents of Madhya Pradesh
 gularpura gaanv par hoga chand kii chaaya kaa kendra, surya or chand hongen ekaakaar laadakui or chakaldi ke bich se hokar gujaregi khagrass surya grahan kii kendriya rekha aane vaali 22 july ko lagane vaala surya grahan sihor jile ke liye kai myanon main mahatvapurn he
 The first is that this is the first Khagrass solar eclipse in the known history of Sehore which will be seen in the entire Sehore district, and the second that after this, no full solar eclipse will be seen in this area
 22 july ke grahan kii kendriya rekha jisko vaigyanik bhashaa main central line of iklips kaha jaataa he wo jile ke nasrullagunj kshetra se hokar gujaregi
 The scientific importance of Gularpura village is more because this village will remain in the center of the eclipse
 sihor ke yuva sahityakar pankaj subir ke anusaar 22 july ko jile main dikhaai dene vaale purna suryagrahan ko lekar logon main kaaphi utsukata he
 This is also because for the first time in the history of the last two hundred years it is happening that the central line of eclipse is passing through the district
 or usike kaaran puure jile main purna suryagrahan dikhaai degaa
 During the solar eclipse, a full-blown solar eclipse is visible
 is baar ye pattee lagbhag dhaisau kilometre chaudee pattee he
 This strip also has a central line on which the period of eclipse is longer
 is baar sihor jila puri tarah se to us dhai sau kilometre chaudee pattee main he hi lekin khaas baat ye he ki central line of iklips bhi jile se hokar nikal rahi he
 This central line is coming out just above Gularpura
 gularpura kaa vaigyanik drushti se mahatv isaliye adhik he kyonki saare vaigyanik prayog isi kendriya rekha par kiye jate hai
 According to litterateur Pankaj Subir, who is preparing a research paper on the complete solar eclipse in the district, this time the central line of the eclipse is passing through our district
 ye kendriya rekha khategaanv tathaa kannaud ke thik bich se hokar nasrullagunj tehsil main sip nadi ke paas suapani gaanv se pravesh karegi
 The village falling just below this central line is Gularpura, situated at a distance of five kilometers from Larkui
 iske baad grahan kii kendriya rekha laadakui tathaa nasrullagunj maarg ko laadakui se lagbhag 3
5 kilometre dur par cross karegi, ye sthaan bhi grahan kii kendriya rekha ke thik neeche aa rahaa he
 After this, the central line of the eclipse will move forward and will pass some distance from the village of Chakaldi, after which it will enter the Raisen district just after the Kolar river
 grahan kii ye kendriya rekha sihor jile kii dakshini seemaa tay karne vaali narmada nadi ke samanaantar hokar jile se niklegi
 In this way, the scientific importance of Nasrullaganj tehsil will be highest during the eclipse because the central line of the eclipse will pass through this area
 halanki puraa kaa puraa sihor jila khagrass surya grahan kaa sakshi banane ja rahaa he purna suryagrahan jis dhai sau kilometre chaudee pattee par dikhaai degaa uskaa sabase andar kaa hissaa arthath kendriya rekha ke donon ore ke lagbhag saath-saath kilometre ke hisse main puraa sihor jila aa rahaa he at: khagrass grahan puure jile main dikhaai degaa
 But still, if we talk about the distance from the central line of the eclipse, then this line will be about eight kilometers from Nasrullaganj, 6 kilometers from Rehti, 30 kilometers from Sehore, 20 from Ichhawar, 10 from Budni and 25 kilometers from Ashta
 sabase najadik rahegaa laadakui jo keval saadhe teen kilometre kii duuri par rahegaa
 Shampur, Bhadakui, Chakaldi, Kolar are the villages that will be close to this line
 kintu sabase charchit hoga gularpura jiske thik upar se chandramaa kii chaaya kaa kendra gujaregaa
 What is the central line of the eclipse: the shadow of the moon falls on the earth in a circular form
 is vrutt kaa jo kendra bindu hota he wo jaise jaise parachhai aage badhati he vaise vaise saral rekha main aage badhata he
 This simple line is called the central line of the eclipse
 is baar bhi jab chandramaa kii parachhai gujarat se hokar madhyapradesh se hoti hui uttar purv ko badhegi to parachhai kaa kendra bindu vaigyaniko ke aakarshan kaa centre rahegaa or sihor jile ke dakshini bhaag main ye centre sip nadi, gularpura, se hota hua kolar nadi tathaa parvatiy kshetra se gujaregaa
 What is the importance of the central line: According to Pankaj Subir, the duration of the eclipse on the central line of the eclipse is also slightly longer and since it is the center of the shadow, the eclipse here is absolutely complete
 vaigyanik prayogon ke liye central line of iklips ko sabase upyukt mana jaataa he kyonki chandramaa kii parachhai or surya kaa kendra yahaan par ekaakaar ho jaataa he
 Where the center of the shadow will pass through Gularpura, it is also inaccessible due to being only two kilometers by road, so there can be a gathering of scientists here
 yahi sthiti laadakui se 3
5 kilometre par nasrullagunj maarg kii bhi he
 Both these places are the best places for scientific experiments
 kahaan he gularpura : laadakui se nasrullagunj jane vaale maarg par lagbhag saadhe chaar kilometre kii duuri par daanye haath par gularpura jane vaala maarg jaataa he jahaan se do kilometre kii duuri nasrullagunj tehsil kaa gaanv gularpura, par sthit he
 In scientific language, this village is situated at 22
779357 degree north latitude and 77
238473 east longitude
 22 july ko sihor main subah ho jaayegaa andhera, do baar hogi subah aane vaali 22july ko bharat se hokar purna suryagrahan kaa path gujaregaa
 Sehore is coming exactly in the middle of this path
 iskaa matlab ye he ki aane vaali 22 july ko sihor main din ke samay hi andhera ho jaayegaa or surya chand kii parachhai ke peeche chhip jaayegaa
 Earlier, on 16 February 1980 and 24 October 1995, the Sehore region did not enter the solar eclipse strip, but the strip passed very close to Sehore and due to that it became night in the day itself
 22 july 2009 ko sihor kshetra bhi sakshi banane ja rahaa he us adbhut ghatana jise khagrass suryagrahan kaha jaataa he
 Actually, this time, the strip of complete solar eclipse is passing through Sehore region
 bharat main surat vadodara indore bhopal se hote hue ye pattee elahabaad varanasi patna darjeeling se hote hue gujaregi
 During the last two complete solar eclipses, Sehore was not in this strip, but that strip came very close to Sehore, so both of them had created a situation of darkness during the day even during the solar eclipse
 is bare to lagbhag teen minutes ke liye puure kshetra main andhkaar chaa jaayegaa kyaaki us samay chandramaa kii parachhai in kshetron ko dhank legi
 In India, this solar eclipse will start at 5:30 am in the morning and at 7:40 am then the shadow of the moon will pass through India
 sihor jis kshetra main aa rahaa he usamen lagbhag 3 minutes tathaa 38 second tak ye suryagrahan dikhaai degaa
 This solar eclipse is a long-term solar eclipse
 22 july ko subah suraj ugane ke kuch hi der pashchaat chandramaa, suraj or pruth?ve ke bich aa jaayegaa or subah hone ke kuch hi der pash?chaat phir se raat ho jaayegi
 After some time the sun will come out again and it will be morning again
 is prakaar 22 july ko sihor vaasi do baar subah hone kii anokhi ghatana ke sakshi banengen
 This will be the longest duration solar eclipse of this century

 This solar eclipse, to be held on July 22, will be fully visible in a 240 km strip area on Earth
 surya par chandramaa kii purnachaaya kii shuruyaat bharat se hogi
 Later, this shadow will fall on the sun till Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and China Japan etc
 surya grahan ke dauraan hi mangal, budh, brihaspati va shu grah bhi dikhaai denge
 The planet Mercury can be seen 9 degrees east of the Sun and the planet Shu in 41 degrees west
 mangal grah shu ke pashchim main thik bagal main hoga
 Jupiter can be seen downstream in the west
 inke alaava prokiyan, syrius, betleges, rigel or cipela taare bhi dikhenge
 To study the impact of the eclipse, on July 22, a large number of scientists of the country and abroad will gather in the affected districts, so it is expected that in Sehore too, there may be a gathering of foreign scientists on that day
 k?yaaki indore se lekar bhopal tak kii wo pattee chandramaa kii chaaya ke thik ken?dra main aa rahi he jis par sihor sthit he
 The complete solar eclipse, to be held on July 22, will be visible on the strip joining Surat, Indore, Sehore, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna
 22 july ko purna surya grahan ke samay sihor main surya kaa aakaar diamond ring ke rup main dikhegaa
 Only partial solar eclipse will be seen in the districts outside the said strip
 kya he surya grahan--surya grahan prithvi, chandramaa or surya kii vah khagoleey sthiti he jisamen prithvi or surya ke bich chandramaa aa jaataa he
 The moon prevents the light of the sun from coming to the earth and the result is darkness during the day
 desh main isse pehle 16farvari 1980, 24oktober 1995, 11 agast 1999 ko purna suryagrahan dikhaayi diya tha
 At that time, Sehore was not on the strip of full solar eclipse but on the partial solar eclipse
 16 farvari 1980 ko purna suryagrahan kii pattee sihor ke sabase paas se hokar nikali thi
 On 24 October 1995, when a full solar eclipse was seen again in India, even then there was no full solar eclipse in Sehore but it had become dark nonetheless
 khaas baat ye he ki us din deepawali bhi thi kintu surya grahan hone ke kaaran duusare din manaai gai thi
 In 1980, the solar eclipse was seen in the evening while in 1995, there was an early morning eclipse and now on July 22, the morning eclipse is going to happen once again
 badal na kar den majaa kirkira is baar chunki suryagrahan ekadam barsaat main maheene main aa rahaa he isaliye badalaa ke kaaran suryagrahan kaa majaa bighadne kii sambhaavna he

 sajiv koshikaon main bhojan ke oxikaran ke falswaroop urja utpann hone kii kriya ko koshikeey shwasan kehete hai
 It is a catabolic activity that can occur in both the presence or absence of oxygen
 is kriya ke dauraan mukt hone vaali urja ko atipi naamak jaev anu main sangrahit karke rakh liya jaataa he jiskaa upyog sajiv apni vibhinn jaivik kriyaaon main karte hai
 This biochemical activity occurs every day and night in the cells of both plants and animals
 koshikaaye bhojya padaarth ke rup main glucose, amino amla tathaa vasiy amla kaa prayog karti hai jinako oxykrut karne ke liye oxygen kaa parmaanu electron grahan karne kaa kaary karata he
 There is an integral relationship between cellular respiration and breathing, and these two activities complement each other
 shwans kriya sajiv ke shwasan angon evam unke vaataavaran ke bich hoti he
 During this, oxygen and carbon dioxide gas are exchanged between the living and their environment and by this action, the oxygen gas reaches the respiratory organs of living organisms
 oxygen gas shwasan angon se visaran dwaara rakt main pravesh kar jaati he
 Blood is the medium of transport that carries this oxygen to the cells of different parts of the body
 vahaan iskaa upyog koshikaaye apane koshikeey shwasan main karti hai
 Respiratory activity occurs in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of each living cell
 shwasan sambandhit praarambhik kriyaayein cytoplasm main hoti he tathaa shesh kriyaayein mitocandriaon main hoti hai
 Since most of the energy is produced in the last phase of the action itself
 isliye mitocandria ko koshika kaa shwasanang yaa shakti-grih kaha jaataa he
 In the first phase of the action of respiration, the fluids go away and the remaining 96 percent of the energy is stored in pyruvic acid
 glicolisis ke pehle paanch charan main 6 carbon vishisht glucose kaa anu urja ke prayog se teen carbon vaale anu main vighatit hota he
 The Krebs cycle is the second stage of oxy respiration
 yah eukariotic koshika ke mitocondria tathaa prokariots ke koshika drav main hoti he
 In this activity, the end substance of glycolysis is pyruvic acid fully oxidized to carbon dioxide and water and many substances are used which are used in other biochemical circuits like amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, fatty acids and glucose etc
 It is used in the manufacture of energy and a large amount of energy is released
 yah kriya kai charnon main hoti he tathaa ek chakra ke rup main kaary karti he
 This cycle was first studied by Hans Adolf Kreb, who named it the Krebs cycle
 is kriya kaa pratham kriyafal citric amla he atah is kriya ko citric amla chakra bhi kehete hai
 Citric acid has 3 carboxylic radicals present, hence it is also known as tri carboxylic cycle or TCA cycle
 crebs chakra kii chakree pratikriyaaon main piruvik amla ke purna upachan se puure chakra main teen sthanon par carbon dioxide kaa ek ek anu baahar nikalataa he, arthath piruvik amla ke teenon carbon parmaanu teen anu carbon dioxide ke rup man baahar nikalate hai
 Pyruvic acid reacts with oxaloacetic acid during the Kreb cycle of respiration
 isamen teen sah-anzim kaam aate hai
 First the pyruvic acid oxidizes in the presence of an enzyme and turns into carbon dioxide and hydrogen
 hydrogen dydrogen grahi enedy ke saath sanyukt hokar enediech tu banaata he tathaa carbon dioxide gas vayumandal main mukt ho jaati he
 In the presence of many respiratory enzymes, the hydrogen present in NADH 2 is converted to water and released energy consisting of oxygen
 yah urja edipi se milakar atipi ke rup main sanchit ho jaati he
 Complete oxidation of one molecule glucose results in the formation of 38 molecule ATP
 atipi urja kaa bhandar he jise urja kii mudra bhi kehete hai
 The energy stored in ATP is decomposed as required by the organisms and the energy is released in which various biological functions of the organisms are conducted
 anaksic shwasan main oxygen kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati he tathaa yah oxygen kii anupasthiti main hota he
 In this process, there is incomplete oxidation of food
 jantuon main is kriya ke falswaroop carbon daai-oxide tathaa lactic amla kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa paudhon main carbon daai-oxide tathaa ithyle alcohol banataa he evam bahut kam maatra main urja mukt hoti he
 This type of respiration occurs in some low-grade plants, yeast, bacteria, and endangered parasites such as roundworms, laceworms, monocystis, etc
 kuch vishesh paristhitiyon main ucch shrenee ke jantuon, paudhon ke utakon, bijon, rasadaar falon aadi main bhi oxygen kii anupasthiti main hota he
 This respiration occurs when the muscles of humans or high-grade organisms are exhausted
 jin jeevadhariyon main yah shwasan hota he use anerobs kehete hai
 Similar to oxy respiration, glycolysis takes place at the beginning of anoxic respiration, at the end of which pyruvic acid is formed
 aage kii prakriya main oxygen ke abhaav main piruvik amla kaa purna oxikaran nahin ho paata he atah is shwasan main oxic shwasan kii tulana main bahut kam urja utpann hoti he
 In plants, this pyruvic acid is converted to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide in the presence of carboxylase enzyme
 iske baad acitaldihide dihydroginej injim kii upasthiti main NADH2 dwaara avakrut hokar NAD tathaa ithyle alcohol main parinat ho jaataa he
 In the absence of oxygen in the muscles of animals and some bacteria, the pyruvic acid produced at the end of glycolysis is converted to lactic acid with the help of NADH2
 kinvan anaksi shwasan kii ek vishisht rasinic kriya he
 It involves the decomposition of complex organic compounds into simple compounds in the presence of micro-organisms and enzymes
 kinvan kii kriya khamir, lactobasilas tathaa ankurit bijon aadi main hoti he
 The process of fermentation can be divided mainly into two parts - alcoholic fermentation and acidic ferment
 alcoholic kinvan kii kriya main glucose kaa vighatan ithyle alcohol tathaa carbon daai-oxide main hota he tathaa kuch urja mukt hoti he
 It occurs in Ist and sprouted seeds etc
 jiimage ek injim he jo east ke dwaara utpann hota he
 Acidic fermentation occurs in bacteria and muscles
 isamen amlon kaa nirmaan hota he
 It also has economic significance
 isaki sahaayta se madiraa, sirka, dahi aadi kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa shilp udyog main rasinic padaarthon kaa utpaadan hota he
 In respiration, the volume of carbon dioxide that exits and the amount of oxygen absorbed is called the respiratory quotient
 yah sadaiv sankhya main nirupit kiya jaataa he jaise- 6CO2 / 6O2 = 1shwasan bhagfal se is baat kaa sanket miltaa he ki shwasan kii kriya main kis prakaar ke khadyapadaarth kaa upchayan ho rahaa he, kyonki yah anupaat vibhinn khadyapadaarthon ke upchayan main vibhinn hota he
 Its value is greater than the unit, less than the unit, depending on the foods used in respiration
 jab shwasan kii kriya main upachayit honevaala khadyapadaarth carbohydrate hota he tab shwasan bhagfal kaa maan ikai hota he, jaise ankurit genhun ke bijon main
 When the food substance used in respiration is fat or protein, the value of the respiratory quotient is less than one unit
 2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O + urja Respiratory coefficient values can range from 0
4 to 0
9 when a food substance is used in respiration
 yadi hamen RQ kaa maan gyaat ho to is baat kaa anumaan laga sakate hai ki shwasan kii kriya main kis prakaar ke khadyapadaarth kaa upchayan ho rahaa he
 In the process of photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the presence of light and release oxygen gases into the atmosphere
 jisase vaataavaran main oxigen kii sandrata kaa bad janaa tathaa carbon daai-oxide kaa kam hona swaabhaavik hota he, parantu vastav main aisa nahin hota he
 In respiration, the living organisms consume oxygen gases at all times of the day and night and discard carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere
 is prakaar shwasan kriya dwaara vaataavaran main oxigen evam carbon daai-oxide gaison kaa santulan bana rahata he
 Respiration is an energy-releasing process
 shwasan kii kriya main bhojya padaarthon kaa oxikaran hota he, jisase unamem sanchit urja mukt hoti he
 During respiration, some part of the free energy is stored as ATP in the cell's mitochondria
 atipi ke rup main sanchit yah urja bhavishya main sajiv jeevadhariyon ke vibhinn jaivik kriyaayon ke sanchaalan main prayukt hoti he
 The released thermal energy helps to balance the body temperature of living organisms
 kuch kiton tathaa samudri jantuon ke sharir se prakaash utpann hota he
 It is a metamorphic form of energy generated by respiration
 kuch samudri jeevon jaise- electric-re machhlee tathaa tarpeado aadi kaa sharir aatm-raksha ke liye vidyutiya tarange utpann karata he, yah vidyut shwasan dwaara utpann urja ke roopaantaran se utpann hota he
 Photosynthesis and respiration are complementary and opposite to each other
 prakaash-sanshleshan main carbon daai-oxide or jal ke bich rasinic kriya ke falswaroop glucose kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxigen mukt hoti he
 Oxidation of glucose in respiration results in the formation of water and carbon dioxide
 prakaash-sanshleshan ek rachanaatmak kriya he iske falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main vruddhi hoti he
 Respiration is a nasal activity, which results in a decrease in the dry weight of living organisms
 prakaash-sanshleshan main saurya urja ke prayog se bhojan banataa he, vikiran urja kaa roopaantaran rasinic urja main hota he
 While the oxidation of food in respiration releases energy, the chemical energy stored in the food is used lively in its various functions
 is prakaar ye donon kriyaayein apane kachche maal ke liye ek duusare ke ant padaarthon par nirbhar rahete hue ek duusare kii poorak hoti hai
 Bio-chemical activities take place in every cell in the body of living organisms
 in kriyaaon ke sampaadan hetu dainik urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The main source of energy is food
 saura urja bhojan main sthitij urja ke rup main sanchit rahati he
 The main substance of respiration in respiration is the complete or incomplete oxidation of glucose in the presence or absence of oxygen, as a result of which the potential energy stored in the food is released as kinetic energy, thereby releasing the energy required to carry out the daily activities of life
 And there is fulfillment
 shwasan main oxikaran ke liye aavashyak glucose, poshan ke madhya hi nirmit hota he
 The energy required for nutrition is derived from the energy produced in respiration
 is prakaar shwasan tathaa poshan ek-duusare se abhinn rup se sambandhit he
 Most of the lifespan method of living respiration is dependent on ATP formation through cellular respiration, but anaerobic respiration first developed during evolution
 vatanirpekshi shwasan ke sarvapratham viksit hone kaa kaaran prithvi ke vayumandal main oxygen gas kii anuplabdhta thi

 These were prokaryotes
 inaki koshikeey sanrachana atyant saral thi
 Since there was no independent oxygen in the atmosphere, anaerobic process of respiration developed in these living organisms that did not require oxygen
 iske baad kareeb 1 billian varsh tak yahi prokariots prithvi par raaj karte rahe
 In it, photosynthesis was done to make its own food
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main surya ke prakaash kii upasthiti main carbon daai-oxide or jal kii sahaayta se carbohydrate kaa nirmaan hota he tathaa oxygen gas mukt hoti he
 The volume of this released oxygen gradually increased in the atmosphere

 Zindagi Tere Naam is a 2012 Hindi-language Indian fiction film directed by Ashu Trikha
 isamen mukhya abhinay mithun chakravarti or ranjita cor ne kiya he or film ek paripakv prem kahani par aadhaarit he
 The film was completed in 2008 but was released in 2012 with some limited copies
 film nicholas sparks ke upanyaas da notebook or isi naam se bani 2004 kii film par aadhaarit he
 The film begins with an old man Mr
 Singh narrating a story to an old woman who has lost her memory day by day
 mistar singh kii kahani ek yuva premiyon siddharth or anjali kii he
 Anjali is a rich girl, but Siddhartha is the son of a poor man
 anjali ke pita hameshaa kii tarah is pyaar ko asweekaar kar dete hai or apni putree ko dur le jate hai
 Sad Siddharth has no other option, but he continues to write letters to her
 vah ek varsh tak lagaataar 365 patr likhata he, lekin ascharyajanak rup se use in 365 main se ek bhi patr kaa uttar nahin miltaa
 Years pass but Anjali does not get Siddhartha, so she eventually plans to marry another man
 lekin niyati ko kuch or hi manjuur hota he or donon premiyon kaa punah milan ho jaataa he
 As the story progresses and reaches after marriage, the older woman realizes that Mr
 Singh is telling them about her own love story and that she is able to suddenly recall her old memories
 Mr
 Singh is overjoyed, but ironically, her memory lasts only for a short time and she loses all memories again like an Alzheimer's patient
 zindagi tere naam menmithun chakravarti ne lagbhag 18 varsh baad apni 1980 kii romantic sah-kalakaar ranjita ke saath punah abhinay kiya
 Earlier he had starred in the crime of Gods together and at that time he also worked together for a gap of 6 years before which he did not appear after the film Baazi and Ghar Ek Mandir in 1984
 iske alaava unhone taraana, suraksha, takadir kaa badshaah, vaardaat, unniis bees, ham se badhkar koun or dhuna filmon main bhi saath main abhinay kiya he
 As the film was completed in 2008, the film's music was released on 13 June 2008

 bhugol vah shaastra he jiske dwaara prithvi ke upree swarup or uske prakritik vibhaagon kaa gyaan hota he
 Establishing a work-causal relationship between the findings of natural sciences, the study of the earth's variations from a human point of view is the essence of geography
 prithvi kii sataha par jo sthaan vishesh hai unki samtaon tathaa vishmataaon kaa kaaran or unka spashtikaran bhugol kaa nijee kshetra he
 The word geography is made up of two words ie earth and round
 bhugol ek ore anya shrunkhalabaddh vigyaanon se praapt gyaan kaa upyog us seemaa tak karata he jahaan tak vah ghatnaon or vishleshanon kii samiksha tathaa unke sambandhon ke yathasambhav samuchit samanvay karne main sahaayak hota he
 On the other hand, knowledge derived from other sciences, which geography uses, has many etymological assumptions and prescribed classifications
 yadi ye dharanaayen or vargeekaran bhugolic uddeshyon ke liye upyogi na hon, to bhugol ko nijee vyutpattik dharanaayen tathaa vargeekaran kii pranali viksit kerani hoti he
 Therefore, geography helps in the growth of human knowledge in three ways: sarvapratham pracheen unani vidwaan iratosthaniz ne bhugol ko dharaatal ke ek vishishtvigyaan ke rup main manyata di
 Subsequently, Herodotus and the Roman scholars Strabo and Claudius Ptolemy gave geography a definitive form of history
 is prakaar bhugol main 'kahan' 'kaise 'kab' 'kyon' va 'kitne' prashnon kii uchit vayakhya kii jaati hai
 Geography is the oldest science and its foundations are reflected in the works of early Greek scholars
 bhugol shabd kaa pratham prayog unani vidwaan iretosthanij ne teesri shatabdi isa purv main kiya tha
 Geography studies the interactions of all physical and human facts on a wide scale and the topographies resulting from these interactions
 yah bataata he ki kaise, kyon or kahan maanviya va prakritik kriyakalapon kaa udbhav hota he or kaise ye kriyalap ek duusare se antarsambandhit hai
 The study method of geography has been changing
 praarambhik vidwaan varnanaatmak bhugolvetta the
 Later, geography evolved into analytical geography
 aaj yah vishay na keval varnan karata he, balki vishleshan ke saath-saath bhavishyavaanee bhi karata he
 According to early evidences, the scholars of this time understood the physical facts of the Earth through map-making and astronomical measurements
 bhugol main aarambhik vidwaan dene kaa shrey yunaan ko hi jaataa he, jisamen pramukh the homer, herrodotus, thels, arastu or iretosthanij
 This period began from the middle of the 15th century to the end of the 18th century
 yah kaal aarambhik bhugolvettaon kii khojon or anveshanon dwaara vishwa kii bhautik va saanskrithik prakruti ke bare main vrahat gyaan pradaan karata he
 The early 17th century witnessed the beginning of new 'scientific geography'
 columbus, vascodigama, magalen or thomas cook is kaal ke pramukh anveshankartta the
 Varenius, Kant, Humboldt and Ritter were prominent geographers of this period
 in vidwaanon ne maanchitrkala ke vikaas main yogadan diya or naveen sthalon kii khoj kii, jiske falswaroop bhugol ek vaigyanik vishay ke rup main viksit hua
 Ritter and Humboldt are often cited as the founders of modern geography
 saamanytah 19veen sadi ke uttarardh kaa kaal aadhunik bhugol kaa kaal mana jaataa he
 In fact, Reitzel was the first modern geographer, who built the structure of modern geography on the foundations established by long-standing geographers
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad bhugol kaa vikaas badi teevr gati se hua
 American and European geographers such as Hartshorne contributed the maximum during this period
 hartshorn ne bhugol ko ek aise vigyaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jo kshetreey vibhinnataaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Current geographers view regional approaches and systematic approaches as complementary approaches rather than contradictory approaches
 bhugol ne aaj vigyaan kaa darja praapt kar liya he, jo prithvi tal par upasthit vividh prakritik or saanskrithik roopon kii vyakhya karata he
 Geography is a holistic and interrelated field study that studies the change in spatial structure from past to future
 is tarah bhugol kaa kshetra vividh vishyon jaise sainya sevaaon, paryaavaran prabandhan, jal sansaadhan, aapadaa prabandhan, mausam vigyaan, niyojan or vividh saamaajik vigyaanon main he
 Apart from this, the geographer can be helpful in daily life related events like tourism, relocation, accommodation and health activities
 vidwaanon ne bhugol ke teen mukhya vibhaag kiye hai- ganitiya bhugol, bhautik bhugol tathaa maanav bhugol
 In the first division, the relation of Earth with other planets and satellites etc
 of the solar world is described and its relative relationship with them is described
 is vibhaag kaa bahut kuch sambandh ganit jyotish se bhi he
 In the second division, the physical form of the earth is described and it is known from whom the river, mountain, country, city, etc
 are called and where are so many countries, cities, rivers or mountains etc
 saadharantah bhugol se uske isi vibhaag kaa arth liya jaataa he
 The third department of geography is human geography, under which political geography also comes, in which it is discussed which departments of the earth are in view of politics, governance, language, caste and civilization etc
 and what is the extent and extent of those departments etc
 
 ek anya drushti se bhugol ke do pradhan ang he : shrunkhalabaddh bhugol tathaa pradeshik bhugol
 Regional geography is the byproduct of centering the coordinate of the branches of chain geography at a particular location on the Earth
 bhugol ek pragatisheel vigyaan he
 Experts in each country are developing their own fields
 falat: isaki nimnlikhit anek shakhaayen tathaa upashakhaayen ho gai he : Economic Geography - Its branches are agriculture, industry, minerals, power and reserves geography and land consumption, commercial, transport and traffic geography
 arthik sanrachana sambandhi yojana bhi bhugol kii shakha he
 Political Geography - Its parts are Geopolitics, International, National, Colonial Geography, Cold War Geography, Strategic and Military Geography
 aitihaasik bhugol --pracheen, madhyakaalin, aadhunik vaidic, puranic, engil sambandhi tathaa arabi bhugol bhi iske ang he
 Creative Geography - Different parts of it are composition clay, survey figure-marking, drawing, vogue, artistry and locomotion
 iske atirikt bhugol ke anya khand bhi viksit ho rahe hai jaise granth vigyaneey, darshanik, manovaigyanik, ganit shastreey, jyotish shastreey evam bhraman bhugol tathaa sthannamadhyayan hai
 Physical Geography - Its different classical parts are topography, ice-science, coastal site formation, geoscience, oceanography, aerodynamics, soil science, biology, medicine or medical geography and paleology
 prithvi par 7 mahadweep hai: asia, europe, africa, uttari america, dakshin america, australia, antarctic
 There are 5 oceans on Earth: Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean | South Ocean Topography - shail - aagney shail kayantarit shail avsaadee shail | Atmosphere, season, temperature, heat, heat, decay heat, humidity
 maanav bhugol, bhugol kii vah shakha he jo maanav samaaj ke kriyakalapon or unke parinaam swaroop bane bhugolic pratirupon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Under this comes political, cultural, social and economic aspects of human beings
 maanav bhugol ko anek shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he, jaise:' Geography has been defined in various forms in different periods of history
 pracheen unani vidwaanon ne bhugolic dharanaon ko do pakshon main rakhaa tha- The emergence of territorial approach in geography also emphasizes the descriptive nature of geography
 hambolt ke anusaar, bhugol prakruti se sambandhit vigyaan he or yah prithvi par paye jane vaale sabhi sadhano kaa adhyayan va varnan karata he
 There are three main branches of geography based on Hetner and Hartshorne: physical geography, human geography and regional geography
 bhautik bhugol main prakritik parighatnaon kaa ullekh hota he, jaise ki jalwaayu vigyaan, mrudaa or vanaspati
 Human geography describes the relationship between surface and human society
 bhugol ek intaraa-anushaasanic vishay he
 Geography has close links with mathematics, natural sciences and social sciences
 jabaki anya vigyaan vishisht prakaar kii parighatnaon kaa hi varnan karte hai, bhugol vividh prakaar kii un parighatnaon kaa bhi adhyayan karata he, jinka adhyayan anyavigyaanon main bhi shaamil hota he
 Thus geography has established itself as a synthesized study of interrelated behaviors
 bhugol sthanon kaa vigyaan he
 Geography is both natural and social science, which studies both human and environment
 yah bhautik va saanskrithik vishwa ko jodta he
 Physical geography studies the natural environment arising from the Earth's system
 maanav bhugol raajnneetik, aarthik, saamaajik, saanskrithik or janankikeey prakriyaaon se sambandhit he
 It is also related to varied use of resources
 praarambhik bhugol sirf sthanon kaa varnan karata tha
 Although it is still included in the study of geography, there has been a change in the description of its patterns in the last few years
 bhugolic parighatnaon kaa varnan saamanytah do upagamon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he jaise pradeshik or krambaddh
 Explains the creation and characteristics of territorial approach areas
 yah is baat kaa varnan karne kaa prayaas karata he ki koi kshetra kaise or kyon ek duusare se alag he
 The state can be physical, social, economic, political, demographic etc
 krambaddh upaagam parighatnaon tathaa saamaanya bhugolic mahatvon ke dwaara sanchalit he
 Each phenomenon is studied on the basis of geography, regional variations and their relationship with each other
 bhugol kii praayah sabhi shakhaon vishesh rup se bhautik bhugol kii shakhaon main tathyon ke vishleshan main ganitiya vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Scientific study of celestial bodies is done in astronomy
 bhootal kii ghatnaon or tatwon par akashiya pindon - surya, chandramaa, dhoomaketuon aadi kaa pratyaksh prabhaav hota he
 That is why geography studies the solar system, the movement of the sun on its virtual path, the daily and annual movements of the earth and the changes that occur as a result - day and night and season changes, lunar arts, solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, etc
 in tatwon or ghatnaon kaa moulik adhyayan khagol vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Thus geography has a closer relationship with astronomy
 bhu-vigyaan prithvi ke sanghathan, sanrachana tathaa itihaas ke vaigyanik adhyayan san sambandhit he
 This includes the study of the constituents of the earth, the forces acting on the surface and the structures produced from them, the structure and distribution of the crustacean rocks, geological periods of the earth, etc
 bhugol main sthalroopon ke vishleshan main bhuvigyaan ke siddhanton tathaa saakshyon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 In this way, physical geography, especially geomorphology, has a very close relationship with geology
 bhootal ko prabhavit karne vaale bhugolic karkon main jalwaayu sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee or mahatvapurn kaarak he
 Meteorology studies the atmosphere, especially the physical processes occurring in it and the various processes related to the associated lithosphere and hydrosphere
 iske antargat vayudab, taapmaana, pawan, ardrata, varshan, meghachhadan, surya prakaash aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 These elements of meteorology are also analyzed in geography
 jal vigyaan prithvi par sthit jal ke adhyayan se sambandhit he
 Along with this, it also contains the study of water exploration, use, control and conservation
 mahasagariya tatwon ke sthanik vitaran kaa adhyayan bhugol kii ek shakha samudr vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Oceanography involves the study of ocean water temperature, density, salinity, ocean waves, currents, etc
 maanav jivan main jalaashyon kaa mahatv sarvopari he kyonki pine se lekar pashuon ke pine, fasalon kii sinchai karne, kaarkaanon main jalaapurti, jalashakti, jal parivahan, matsyakhet aadi vibhinn roopon main jal aavashyak hi nahin anivaary hota he
 Thus we find that there is a very close and close relationship between geography and hydrology
 mrudaa vigyaan mitti ke nirmaan, sanrachana or visheshta kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karata he
 The distribution of soils on the ground floor is studied under soil geography
 mitti kaa adhyayan krishi bhugol kaa bhi mahatvapurn vishay he
 Thus, the closeness of geography is also found from soil science
 ped-paudhon kaa maanav jivan se gaharaa sambandh he
 Botany is the scientific study of plant life and its entire world forms
 prakritik vanaspatiyon ke sthanik vitaran or visheshtaon kaa vishleshan bhautik bhugol kii shakha jaev bhugol or upashakha vanaspati yaa padap bhugol main kii jaati he
 Animal science or zoology is the scientific study of the structure, classification and functions of all types of animal life
 manushya ke liye jantu jagat or pashu sansaadhan kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 Animals are very useful to humans
 manushya ko pashuon se anek upyogi padaarth yatha doodh, maance, oon, chamada aadi praapt hote hai or kuch pashuon kaa prayog saamaan dhone or parivahan yaa sawari karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Biogeography is a sub-branch of animal geography in which the spatial distribution and characteristics of various animals are analyzed
 maanav jivan ke aarthik, saamaajik, saanskrithik sabhi kshetron main pashu jagat kaa mahatvapurn sthaan hone ke kaaran isko bhugolic adhyayanon main bhi vishisht sthaan praapt he
 Therefore, geography has a close relationship with animal science
 bhojan, vastra or aashray manushya kii praathmik aavashyaktaaen hai jo kisi bhi desh, kaal yaa paristhiti main prayek vyakti ke liye anivaary hoti hai
 Along with this, there are other social, economic, political etc
 requirements of human or human group which are very much based on the economy
 arthvyavastha kaa adhyayan karnaa arthshaastra kaa mul vishay he
 Economy is the management, organization and administration of all the livelihood sources or economic resources of a place, region or community
 vividh aarthik pakshon kaa sthanik adhyayan bhugol kii ek vishisht shakha aarthik bhugol main kiya jaataa he
 Sociology is the study of social life, behavior and social action of human beings, which includes the study of the origin, development, structure and social institutions of human society
 samajashaastra maanav samaaj ke vikaas, pravriti tathaa niyamon kii vaigyanik vyakhya karata he
 The entire human society is divided into many classes, groups and communities which have their own customs, customs, traditions and rules on which the influence of geographical environment is definitely found
 atah samajashastreey adhyayanon main bhugolic gyaan aavashyak hota he
 Human geography studies the history of human civilization and the development of human society in geographical perspective
 kisi bhi desh yaa pradesh ke itihaas par vahaan ke bhugolic paryaavaran tathaa paristhitiyon kaa gaharaa prabhaav paaya jaataa he
 When we analyze natural and human or cultural facts from a developmental point of view, then there is an explanation of the changing relationship between man and earth
 kisi pradesh main jansankhya, krishi, pashupaalan, khanan, udyog dhandhon, parivahan ke sadhano, vyapaarik evam vanijki sansthaaon aadi ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan maanav bhugol main kiya jaataa he jiske liye upyukt sakshya or pramaan itihaas se hi praapt hote hai
 The 'governance system' is the focal point of the study of political science
 isamen vibhinan rashtron evam rajyon kii shashan pranaaliyon, sarkaron, antarrashtriya sambandhon aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Political geography is a branch of human geography that includes the study of the extent, extent of politically organized areas, their various components, subdivisions, governed territories, resources, internal and foreign political relations, etc
 maanav bhugol kii ek anya shakha bhuraajnneeti bhi he jiske antargat bhootal ke vibhinn pradeshon kii raajnneetik pranali vishesh rup se antarrashtiy raajnneeti par bhugolic karkon ke prabhaav kii vyakhya kii jaati he
 It is clear from these facts that geography and political science are closely related
 janankiki yaa janasankhyikee ke antargat jansankhya ke aakaar, sanrachana, vikaas aadi kaa parimanatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In this, along with the collection, classification, evaluation, analysis and projection of population data, demographic models and procedures are also explained
 maanav bhugol or uski upashakha jansankhya bhugol main bhugolic paryaavaran ke sambandh main janankikeey prakramon tathaa pratirupon main paayi jane vaali kshetreey bhinnataaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Thus due to the subject analogy, there is a close relationship between geography and demography

 Based on the presence of fluid in these tests, macular edema is detected by how widespread, localized, or it is composed of several small blisters around the center of the macula
 yah ek saamaanya sthiti he jo sistoid mecular edima kehalaata he
 The most effective treatment strategies for macular edema include correcting its underlying causes as well as excessive leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in and around the macula
