 saptam sthaan ke dahini ore shatru or vyaadhi hai to bain ore shatru or vyaadhi hai to bain ore mrityu he
 The tenth is fate on the right and income on the left
 janmapatri dwaara praaniyon ke jivan main ghatit honevaale parinaamon ke taratmyon ko batalaane ke liye in baarah raashiyon ke swami maane gaye saat grahon main paraspar maitri, shatruta or tatasthta kii kalpana kii gai he or in swaabhaavik sambandhon main bhi visheshta batalaane ke liye taatkaalik maitri, shatruta or tatasthta kii kalpana dwaara adhimitra, adhishathru aadi kalpit kiye gaye he
 Similarly, the higher zodiac signs of the planets have also been conceived for the above purpose only
 in kalpanaaon ke anusaar kisi bhav main sthit grah yadi apane grih main ho to bhavafal uttam, mitra ke grih main madhyam or shatru ke grih main nimna koti kaa hoga
 If such planets are in their high, then the result is good and low, then it will be inferior
 iske madhya main anupaat se falon kaa taratamya laana hota he
 From the immediate friendship, enmity, parity, etc
, there has to be more reduction in the good results specified by natural friendship etc
 janmapatri main mangal kii raashi mesh or brishchik tathaa makar ucch he
 Taurus and Libra Venus and Pisces are high

 The parentheses presented are the visuals to know how the two expressions are written in the horoscope
 hindu or unani donon pranaaliyon main bhaavon kii kalpana ek si kintu 6, 11 or 12 bhaavon main bhed spasht he
 Although both the enemy and the disease are considered false in the Hindu system, but the enemy is the main one
 unani jyotish main gyarahavaan mitra bhav or barahawaan trubhav he
 Hindu astrology has the 11th income and the twelfth expenditure
 janmkundali main grahon ke sambandh main anya kalpanaayen pranivarg ke parsparik sambandhon or anya sambhavya paristhitiyon par aadhaarit he jinke dwaara prastut kiye gaye faladesh praaniyon par ghatit honevaali kriyaaon ke anuroop hi hote hai
 The natural friendship, opposition and neutrality of the planets, and the beliefs of immediate xenophobia, harmony and equanimity are considered as the cornerstone for the horoscope
 isi prakaar surya aadi saat grahon ko kramash: aatma, man, shakti, vaani, gyaan, kaam, du:kha, tathaa mesh aadi baarah raashiyon kii kram se shir, mukh, ur hriday, udar, kati, vasti, ling, uru, ghutana, jangha or charan aadi kii kalpanaayen, praaniyon kii maansik avasthaa tathaa shaareerik vikruti, chihn aadi ko bataane ke liye kii gai hai
 The values of the planets, white, etc
, Brahmins etc
 caste, mild, cruel, etc
 Nature is also for the introduction of nature, form, color, caste and attitude
 chori gai vastu ke parigyaan ke liye inkaa safal prayog prasiddh he
 The different elements of the entire life span of beings are the result of the conditions and intuitions of the planets affected in different forms
 jivan main koun-sa samay sukhadaayak tathaa koun-sa arishthprad hoga, bhagyoday kab hoga, mata, pita, bandhu, santati, stri aadi kaa sukh kab kaisaa rahegaa, vivaah kab hoga, koun-si grahadasha jivan main samruddhi udel degi or kis grah kii dasha main dar-dar kii khaak chanani padegi, sabase badhkar kis samay is sansar ko sadaa ke liye chhod dena hoga ityadi sabhi baton kaa samay, grahon kii dashaon or antardashaon se hi suchit kiya jaataa he
 The constellation of the natal Moon is the head for calculating the planet Dasha
 krittika se gananaa karke nau nau nakshatron main kramash: surya, chandra, bhoum, rahu, guru, shani, budh, ketu or shukr kii dashaon kaa bhogakaal 6,10,7,18,16 19,17,7,20 varshon ke kram se 120 varsh mana gaya he
 Thus by dividing the number from the Kritika to the natal moon of the natal moon, the rest of the planet whose number will be considered in the birth time and the time spent before the birth of the planet and the birth of the planet from the Panchaganya Bhoga period of the constellation
 Subsequent enjoyment periods are presented to the future disciples
 yadi grah kundali main apane grih yaa mitra ke grih main ho athwa ucch kaa ho to vah jis bhav kaa swami hoga, uskaa fal uttam hoga tathaa shatru ke grih main athwa neech raashi main uske sthit hone par fal nikrusht hoga
 Now the question arises that all calculations are started from Ashwini nakshatra
 phir grahadasha kii gananaa krittika se kyon kii jaati he
 The fact is that our planetary prediction has been going on since our Nakshatra calculation started from Kritika
 maharishi garg ne vedikakaal main do swatantra nakshatra gananaaon kaa ullekh kiya he- ek krittikadi or duusari dhanishthadi
 Garga sentence is that - Tesham sarveshan nakshatranam karmasu kritika prathamacchakshte shravishtu numeya: Poorva lagnanam means that in all nakshatras, krittika is said to be the first among the deeds of fire etc
 rahasy yah he ki jis samay krittika kaa tarapunj vishavadvrutt main tha us samay krittikadi nakshatra gananaa kaa aarambh hua
 When Uttarayana started on Dhanishthana, Dhanishtani calculation began
 taittiriya brahman main likhaa he ki mukhan vaa etannakshana yatkruttika etaah vai praachai disho na chyavante arthath krittika sab nakshatron main pratham he
 It does not move away from the east direction in the Uday period
 yah nishchay he ki jo grah yaa nakshatra vishuvadvrutt main hota he usee kaa udai purv bindu main prithvi tal par sarvatra hota he
 When calculated according to the celestial position of the rod, this time proves to be about 5100 years ago
 at: hamaare faladesh kii grahadasha paddati itani pracheen to he hi
 The condition of our horoscope, influenced by the sequence of inferences, the Arab countrymen started a new system of the year, called 'tajik'
 isamen praani ke janm kaal se saura varsh kii purti ke samay kaa lagn laakar ek varsh ke andar honevaale shubhashubhon kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he
 It has a predominance of 16 yogas in which profit, loss and physical condition are considered
 in 16 yogon ke naam arabi bhashaa ke hi hai sanskrit granthon main unke naam uccharan ke anusaar kuch parivartit ho gaye he yatha, iqbaal asharaf, ittsaal aadi
 At present, the system of the birth chart of the horoscope by doing twelve parts of the zodiac is not mentioned in the ancient Vedic literature of India
 kintu atharv jyotish main bahut pehle se hi is paddati ke mul tatv nihit hai
 In this, nine parts of the 27 constellations of the zodiac are considered as one part of each of the three constellations
 inamen pratham 'janm nakshatra', dasavaan 'karm nakshatra' tathaa unnisvan 'aadhaan nakshatra' mana gaya he
 The rest is considered to be Sampat, Vipat, Kshemya, Pratvar, Sadhak, Naidhan, Maitra and Param Maitra in the order, such as- inamen janm, sampat or naidhan arthath 1, 2 or 7, dwadash bhavvaali janmkundali ke 1, 2 or 8 sthanon se milte hai
 Atharva is the tenth Karma constellation in astrology
 aadhunik paddati main bhi dasham sthaan karm he
 This proves that the nine places in Atharva astrology are interwoven into some of the twelve places of the present horoscope, which existed in our method of preaching before the introduction of nouns like Aries
 purv kshitij main laganevaale nakshatron ko lagn nakshatra maanane kaa varnan 3300 varsh pracheen vedang jyotish main bhi he
 Such as - Sravishtabhyo Gunabhyastan Pragvilagnan Specificand
 arthath gun teen kii gananaa kar ghanishta se purv kshitij main lage nakshatron ko bataanaa chahie
 From this it becomes clear that at that time the nine parts of the Nakshatra Chakra were done by dividing three into 27 Nakshatras
 atharv jyotish ke nav vibhaagon kaa saamanjasy isse ho jaataa he
 European scholars believe that twelve parts or twelve zodiac signs of the constellation cycle came from outside India
 kintu hamaare vaidic sahitya main surya kii gati ke aadhaar par nakshatra chakra ke baarah bhaag or chandramaa kii dainik gati ke aadhaar par 27 bhaag pehle se kiye gaye hai
 Although the stories related to the constellations and the moon are in our Puranas, there are no stories of the Meshadi zodiacs but in the Greek literature
 phir bhi itane se hi siddh nahin hota ki rashigananaa or bhav bharat main baahar se aae
 The statements of European scholars are giving evidence to the contrary
 jaikobi kaa kathan he ki janmkundali main dwadash grihon se fal bataane kii paddati formikas matternas ke granth main milti he
 It is also known here that no Jataka texts are known in Greece even before Ptolemy
 tolemi ke do jataka granth almijasti or titrabiblas kahe jate hai kintu yah pramanit nahin he
 It is not possible to have 6 Aryan writers and five Arasha writers in the pre-250 years of Varahamihira, if the preaching of the book of Parmicus Maternus was accepted as true in India after 354 AD
 varahamihir ne apane purvavarti may yavan, manittth, satya, vishnugupt aadi aacharyon kaa naam liya he
 Bhattottapal, the commentator of Brihajatak, holds that he is Acharya Chanakya, the minister of Vishnugupta Moon
 is prakaar yah hamaari rashigananaa paddati isvi san se 300 varsh purv kii siddh hoti he
 This does not make the statement that the census came from outside India
 brihatsamhita ke grahacharadhyay main grahagochar fal die hai
 Chandra is the first place in it
 us adhyay main 'mandavy' kaa ullekh he
 Mandavya is a great writer
 mandavy ke granth main chandrakundali mukhya thi athwa usamen chandramaa ke sthaan se vichaar kiya gaya tha
 This idea was from 9 places of Atharva Jyatish
 10 raashiyon ke prachaar main aane ke baad iskaa vichaar 12 bhaavon se hone laga
 Therefore, it is only reasonable to assume that the method of horoscope was practiced by a sage like Garga etc
 kyonki isvi san se 500 varsh purv vidyaman vishisht siddhant main bhi lagn or bhaavon kii kalpana he
 Some zodiac signs and Greek names in Indian astrology are proof that we had ancient contact with the Greeks
 unase anek vidyaon or kalaon kaa aadan-pradaan bhi hua
 Varahamihira has written that- isse yah nishkarsh nahin nikaalnaa chahie ki hamaara sara kaa sara jatakashastra udhaar liya gaya he
 Knowing the method of Indian horoscope, the Greeks expanded it and presented it in a new form to the Indians in the time of Varahamihira
 falat: varahamihir ne unki hora, dreshkan aadi naveen paddatiyon ke saath raashiyon ke naam bhi unani hi rakh liye, jaise aaj hamaara bijganit arabon dwaara europe main failaayaa jaakar apane bahad rup main pun: bharat lautakar naveen ganit ke naam se vikhyath hua he
 Just as there are twelve zodiac signs in the sky, in the present time there are twelve expressions in the horoscope
 janm kundali yaa janmang chakra main kisi ke janm samay main akaash kii us janm sthaan par kya sthiti thi, iskaa akashi naksh he
 The chart of the twelve mines is made in Janmang
 hindu jyotish inako " bhav " kehete hai
 In English it is called 'house' and in Persian it is called 'khana'

 The path of some comets is annular and appears only once

 Most comets are made of ice, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and other substances such as silicate and organic mixtures
 dhoomaketu ke teen mukhya bhaag hote he - The navel is the center of the comet, which is made of stone and ice
 naabhi ke chaaron ore gas or ghul ke badal ko coma kehete he
 The gas and dust from the navel and the coma take the shape of a tail

 This increases the size of coma to millions of miles

 Due to the solar wind, this question is in the opposite direction from the Sun

 a center of smokestacks with small orbit is located inside the orbit of the larger planets
 It is clear that big planets have an impact on the orbit of the smoke coming from the Oort cloud
 Jupiter is particularly affected by a large number of such smoke-filled masses whose mass is greater than the mass of all the other planets in the solar system
 parikrama kaksha par padane vaale prabhaav ke kaaran kabhi kabhi pehle se khoje gaye dhoomaketu kho jate he | kabhi kabhi aisa hota he ki khoje gaye nae dhoomaketu ke gahan adhyayan ke baad yah gumshuda dhoomaketuon ke rup main pahachaane jate he | 11P / temple - swift - leniyar dhoomaketu iskaa udhaaharan he | san 1869 main usko sabase pehle dekha gaya, 1908 ke baad brihaspati ke prabhaav ke kaaran uski kaksha badal gai or vah antariksh main kahin ojhal ho gaya | san 2001 main leniyar naam ke vaigyanik ne uski phir se khoj kii thi | Before the development of the scientific method, names of Dhumketu were kept in many ways
 Before the 20th century, the names of Dhumketu were named on the basis of year, such as 'great Dhumketu of 1580', 'great Dhumketu of September 1882'
 a scientist named Edmund Haley proved that the comet seen in 1531, 1607 and 1582 was the same and predicted to reappear in 1957
 In fact, in 1959, this comet reappeared in the sky, when it was named Haley Dhumketu
 Similarly, the names of the recurring dhumkets were named after the person who computed his tour class
 Since then, recurring dhumkets have been named after the one who searched for them, but only once visible dhumkhetoos are named after the year in which they appear even today

 In 1994 the International Astronomical Union approved the new naming system
 The names of comets are now represented by the year they are searched, by the indication of the fortnight they have been discovered, and by the serial number of the search for the same year
 Such a system is already being used for asteroids
 Thus in the second fortnight of February 2006, Dhumketu, which is the fourth comet discovered in that year, will be named 2006 D4
 The prefix is also added to indicate the nature of the comet

 Is Similarly, the name of Haley Comet which was first identified as a recurring comet is 1P / 1682 Q1

 Some people called it a falling star
 Aristotle discussed comets in his first book Mitrology
 Many earlier intellectuals recognized it as the planets of the solar system
 But Aristotle rejected this notion because the planets appear in a fixed constellation in the sky while comets can be seen anywhere in the sky
 According to Aristotle, comets were born in the outer atmosphere of the Earth
 Like comets, Aristotle had the same belief for meteors, auroras, boreolias and galaxies
 Many erstwhile intellectuals disagreed with this view of Aristotle
 Seneca disagreed on this view in the Natural Question
 According to him, comets have no effect on the external environment or wind
 Human beings then had little knowledge about space

 After traveling with the help of stars for 17 days, as Odysseus approaches the island of Fiacia, the rage of Poseidon, the god of the sea, shatters his fleet and begins to sink into the waves
 tabhi samudr kii apsara liukothea use ek pranarakshak roomaal detii he jiske sahare vah antat: fiaisia pahunchataa he
 In the sixth verse, Nausicaa, the daughter of King Elsinus of Fiacia, receives orders from Athena in the dream to wash her clothes on the beach the next morning, where she meets Naked Odysseus
 saatven anuvaak main vah use kapadaa pahanaakar ghar le aati he
 In the eighth verse, King Elsinus greets Odysseus in the court
 is avasar par bhaat trajan-yuddh-sambandhi geet gaata he to odisius vichlit hokar rone lagata he
 Odysseus has to give his real introduction when the king asks him the reason for crying
 agle teen anuvaakon main odisiastroy ke patan ke baad kii apni 10 varsh kii romaanchak yatra kaa vivaran sabko sunaata he
 In the 12th Anuwak, Odysseum arrives at Ithaca on the magical ship of Phycia where Athena meets him as a shepherd and transforms him into a beggar so that his wife's benefactors do not harm him by recognizing him
 13wein anuvaak main ethina odisius ko uske shookarpal ke yahan bhejkar swayan sparta jaati he or telemacas ko shighrata se ethaka lautne kaa aadesh detii he
 In the 14th verse there is a conversation between Odysseus and Schukarpal
 15wein anuvaak main telemacas apni maan ke panigrahanarthiyon ke shadyantr se bachakar surakshit ghar laut aata he
 In the 16th verse, Telemacus recognizes his father in the house of Schukarpal
 pashchaat pitaputra pinalopi ke panigrahanarthiyon se chhutkaaraa paane kii yojana banaate hai
 In the 17th and 18th paragraphs, beggar Odysseus arrives at his palace where his old dog, Eragus, recognizes him and dies in joy
 isi samay odisius prasaad main upasthit pinalopi ke panigrahanarthiyon kaa auddhatya dekhtaa he jisase aage chalakar unhen maarane ke uske bhayankar krity kii uchit bhoomika bhi ban jaati he
 In the 19th episode, Odysseus and Pinalopi have a face-to-face conversation, but Pinalopi does not recognize her husband, while her old husband Euryclia recognizes her by looking at the childhood amputation on her leg
 20 wein anuvaak main odisius gusse ke kaaran raat bhar jagakar anek baaten sochataa rahata he
 In the 21st verse, Pinlopi challenges his descendants to shout the bow of Odysseus in the innings in such a way that he arrives out of the middle of 12 rings hanging in a huge tree
 sab asafal hote hai kintu bhikshukveshi odisius chhallon ke bich se tir nikaal detaa he
 The 22nd verse marks the climax of the epic
 odisius pinalopi ke saare panigrahanarthiyon ko tiron se bedhakar maar detaa he
 No one escapes, as all the doors of the spacious chamber were already locked, in the 23rd episode Pinelopy recognizes her husband, and the heartwarming and touching scene of the two meet
 maha kavy ke antim athwa 24wein adhyay main, jise kuch aalochak prakshipt maanate hai, devdoot marakari pinalopi ke sabhi panigrahanarthiyon kii atmaaon ko narak ke nichle evam nikrusht pradeshon main le jaataa he jahaan unhen vibhinn prakaar ke traasamay dand die jate hai
 Meanwhile, Odysseus goes to the fields outside the city and meets his father Lartise
 ant main odisius ke ghar laut aane ke upalaksh main shandaar daavat hoti he or ithaka main sukhshanti sthapit hone kii soochna ke saath granth kaa samaapan ho jaataa he
 The story of the Iliad is just 50 days - the events of the last two months of the tenth year
 yadi kathanak katha ke armbh se prarambh hota to us leeda evam hans ke sanyog se prarambh hona chahie tha
 But Homer catches the last part of the story
 bich-bich main vah purv katha kaa sanket karata jaataa he, vah bhi ek kram se nahin
 The legend is already known to the Greek audience
 isi se use koi kathinaayee nahin gyaat hoti, anyathaa ek anjaan vyakti ko katha kaa prathamansh tabhi spasht hoga jab ek baar vah sampoorn kavy kaa pathan kar jaae
 The second thing to keep in mind about Elliot is that his subject, as is evident from Mangalacharan, is the anthem of Echiles
 jahaan yah krodh apni charam parinti ke baad samaapt hota he
 The story ends until a little further, that is, the direct results of this anger until the death of Petraclus and indirect death of Hector, but the death of Echileus, the destruction of Troy, etc
 does not come in this epic
 homer apane mahakavy main ghoshit vishay par badi kadai se ‘tu da point’ sthit rahata he - jaraa bhi idhar-udhar nahin jaataa
 The result of this extreme restraint is the story or 'unity of the subject'
 prayek ghatana samoochee dizin ke andar kasi hui angik sangati ke saath baithaayi gayi he
 There is a lack of unity and consistency in the Indian epics and the whole structure is complete with a loose narrative system
 valmiki ramayana kaa vishay he polastyavadh, par usamen avaantar ghatnaayen bahut deele sutron se judi hai
 In the Mahabharata, this 'unity' is not at all - it is written in the style of encyclopedia
 tulsidas ke ramcharitamanas main avashya yah ‘gathili ekta’ evam ‘angik sangati’ homer kii hi tarah milti he
 As far as the unity and effectiveness of the subject is concerned, no Indian poet, even Kalidas, can equal Tulsidas
 yah baat yahan abhidharth main likhi ja rahi he
 Homer describes and describes the anger of Echiles and its development in 9 cantos and concludes the story by taking its direct, indirect fruits
 yadi vah aage kii ghatana, ekiles kii mrityu evam try-dhwans, tak varnit karne ke pralobhan main padataa to kavy main vah kati-chhati gathili dhaanchaagat ekta nahin aa paati
 The structure would have become loose
 arestu ne homer kii pratibha kii saraahna ‘poytics’ ke un adhyyon main kii he or homer kaa hi anukaran kaa adarsh banane kii shiksha di he, jahaan vah ‘teen ektaaon’ evam prabhavanviti kii charchaa karata he
 In Greek literature, there is a great emphasis on structure
 yah rup vidhaan kii jyamithik sangati, unki murtikla, natyakala aadi sabhi ke andar spasht he
 He did not attach any less importance to Bhaanda than sentiment and ornamentation
 homer main yah pravriti na keval beej rup main vidyaman he, balki uskaa sarvottam rup homer main hi miltaa he
 The whole 'action' in the Iliad is circular
 jahaan se prarambh hota he, vahiin par aakar samaapt hota he
 The rites that provided the structure and the homeland to the Greek tragedy are the ethnic treasures of the Greeks, and they also establish the life of Homer's genius
 isi se homer evam kaalaantar ke tragedy sahitya main dhaanchaagat evam bhavgat samanta he
 The structure of the Greek tragedy is governed by three elements - 'one country', 'one period', and 'one trade or subject'
 elliod main ‘desh’ ek hi he arthath sari ghatana try ke mehalon evam saamne ke samudratat par hi hoti he
 The 'period' is also the same, because the epic story is of a continuous duration of 50 days
 arthath, ‘kaal’ kaa ek anwarat akhand rup diya gaya he - 10wein varsh ke antim 50 dinon ko pakad kar
 He does not spread the circle on the surface for 10 years and he covers it within 50 days
 vyapaar yaa vishay bhi ek hi he - ekiles kaa krodh, uskaa shaman evam upsanhaar ke rup main uskaa fal
 Just here, the epic ends
 odesi kaa vishay vistrut he
 The hero of the epic Odysseus wandered for 10 years after the war
 is dashak ke antim bhaag se is mahakavy kaa bhi prarambh hota he
 The structure is exactly like the Iliad
 elliod ke 50 dinon kii ghatana main vartmaan kaa hi praadhanya he - un 50 dinon main kya ghatit hua, isi kaa varnan kavi kaa uddeshy he
 The events of the past come somewhere along the way
 parantu odesi main yah baat nahin
 The theme of Odyssey is 'odysseus's sad journey'
 atah yah 10 varshon kaa bhraman-vrittant hi uskaa uddeshy he
 Like the Iliad, it begins at the end of the decade, but its purpose is more related to the 'past' than the 'present'
 isliye homer aadhunik filmon kaa flashbek-technic kaa upyog karata he
 The epic begins in the 10th year, when Odysseus Apsara begins a voyage from the island of Kelipso, and his fractal vessel sinks and flows into the land of Nasica
 vahaan ke raja ko apane 9 varshon kii ram kahani sarg 9 se 12 tak main sunaata he
 The 'PRE-MEMORY' technique is in this 9th to 12th cantos
 parantu is purv smriti ke garbh main bhi ‘antahpurv smriti’ he 11wein sarg main, jab vah ekiles ko try yuddh kii katha kaa sheshansh sunaata he
 The time organization of Odyssey is very complicated
 ‘vartmaan’ ke garbh main ‘purv’ evam us purv ke garbh main ‘antahpurv’ nihit he
 The entire period can be termed as 'mukul-patra-bandh'
 kali main pankhudiyon kii ek parat ke andar duusari parat, duusari ke andar teesri parat padi rahati he
 In the same way, there is a time lag for Odessi
 yah kaal-bandh dvigun pechida isliye ho jaataa he ki odesi kaa ‘desh’ ek nahin he
 The theme of Odyssey is 'fierce Seascape and Cavitation'
 atah vyapaar ke kendra do ho jate hai
 One is Ithaca where her queen Pinilopy is waiting for her and her sons and sisters are surrounded by her enemies
 doosraa he odesius swayan evam uski samudr-sataha par kii chalyman sthiti
 The events of these two 'countries' are handled by the great master Zeus
 ‘desh kii ekta’ na hone par bhi vishay yaa vyapaar kaa ekta usee tarah kati-chanti rup main vidyaman he jis tarah ‘elliod’ main
 The poet carefully and carefully protects the consistency and goodness of the entire business by placing the other event in one layer
 elliod kii vishay-vastu simit he
 That is the pattern of the tragedy
 badi saralata se kaary-prabhaav kii ekta saadh lee gayi
 But the subject of 'odyssey' is broad
 yah upanyaas kii tarah he
 Yet so carefully the unity of work and influence has been edited that even today's genre-oriented or form-oriented novels fade in front of him
 ek aadi kavi ke liye-ek prarambhkartta ke liye itani badi kaarigari aashcharya kaa hi vishay he
 In short, the Ilayad's design is tragedy and Odyssey's novel
 itnaa hote hue bhi odesi bahut-si baton main elliod ke samaanaantar he
 Both Iliad and Odesi poetry begin by holding the end of the story
 donon kaa ant bhi prarambh main ghoshit vishay par hota he
 The motion of both are circular
 donon main sargon kii sankhya 24 he
 Hector dies at the end of the Iliad, and the prince-pleading princes in Odyssey
 elliod ke ant main ek shant vaataavaran, kuch kaal ke hi liye sahi, upasthit ho jaataa he jisamen donon paksh mritkon kaa dah-sanskaar karte hai
 In Odessi, at the end, there is a final peace and lasting peace
 donon mahakavyon ke andar aaye charitra ek hi paimaane or saanche main dhale gyaat hote hai
 The deviousness and readiness that Anthony helps the Greek warriors in the Iliad, as well as in Odyssey
 pojidon donon main ek krur evam ujdd devtaa kii tarah he
 Odesius is depicted as courageous, heroic, cruel, and devious in both epics
 minilas usee prakaar dhani, udaar hriday yoddha donon mahakavyon main he
 a friend of wise old Nestor also stays there
 yadi in mahakavyon ke rachayita alag-alag hote to charitron ke chithran main fark avashya aa jaataa
 For example, Homer's 'diomidil' or 'afroditi' are completely different from Virgil's Diomidis or Afroditi
 kathanak evam charitron kaa samaan pattern bataata he ki donon kavy ek hi vyakti kii pratibha se nicksruth hai

 vishesh— is samay saare sansar main praayah hajaaron prakaar kii bhashaayen boli jaati hai jo saadharantah apane bhashiyon ko chhod or logon kii samaj main nahin aatin
 People know the language of their society or country well because they are accustomed since childhood, but the language of other countries or societies does not speak well without it
 bhashavigyaan ke gyaataaon ne bhashaaon ke arya, semetic, hemetic aadi kai varg sthapit karke unamem se prayek kii alag alag shakhaayen sthapit kii hai or un shakhaakon ke bhi anek varg upvarg banaakar unamem badi badi bhashaaon or unke prantiy bhedon, upbhaashaon athaav boliyon ko rakhaa he
 Just like our Hindi language is a language of the Indian Arya branch of the Aryan class of languages in terms of linguistics; And Brajbhasha, Awadhi, Bundelkhandi etc
 are its dialects or dialects
 paas paas boli janevaali anek upbhaashaon yaa boliyon main bahut kuch samya hota he; or usee samya ke aadhaar par unke varg yaa kul sthapit kiye jate hai
 This is also the case in many big languages whose mutual equilibrium is not so much, but still a lot happens

 The Sanskrit and Prakrit have evolved from the Vedic language of the Indian Aryans, the Apabhramamsa from the Prakritas, and the modern Indian languages from the Apabhransa
 saamanytah bhashaa ko vaicharik aadan-pradaan kaa madhyam kaha ja saktaa he
 Language is the most reliable means of expression
 yahi nahin vah hamaare abhyantar ke nirmaan, vikaas, hamaari asmita, saamaajik-saanskrithik pahchaan kaa bhi saadhan he
 Without language, man is completely incomplete and different from his history and tradition
 is samay saare sansar main praayah hajaaron prakaar kii bhashaayen boli jaati hai jo saadharantah apane bhashiyon ko chhod or logon kii samaj main nahin aatin
 People know the language of their society or country well because they are accustomed from childhood, but the language of other countries or societies is not well learned without it
 bhashavigyaan ke gyaataaon ne bhashaaon ke arya, semetic, hemetic aadi kai varg sthapit karke unamem se prayek kii alag alag shakhaayen sthapit kii hai or un shakhaon ke bhi anek varg-upvarg banaakar unamem badi badi bhashaaon or unke prantiy bhedon, upbhaashaon athaav boliyon ko rakhaa he

 Sanskrit and Prakrit have evolved from the Vedic language of the Indian Aryans, Apabhramamsa from Prakrit and modern Indian languages have developed from Apabhramsa
 praayah bhashaa ko likhit rup main vyakt karne ke liye lipiyon kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Language and script are two integral aspects of emotionalization
 ek bhashaa kai lipiyon main likhi ja sakati he or do yaa adhik bhashaaon kii ek hi lipi ho sakati he
 For example, Punjabi, Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi are written in both, while Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit, Nepali etc
 are all written in Devanagari
 bhashaa ko pracheen kaal se hi paribhaashit karne kii koshish kii jaati rahi he
 Some of its main definitions are as follows: ham vyavhaar main yah dekhte hai ki bhashaa kaa sambandh ek vyakti se lekar sampoorn vishwa-sristi tak he
 There are many forms of property earned from this tradition in practice between the individual and society
 samaaj saapekshata bhashaa ke liye anivaary he, thik vaise hi jaise vyakti saapekshata
 And language is indicative ie it is a 'symbol-position'
 isaki pratikatmak gatividhi ke chaar pramukh sanyojak haih do vyakti-ek vah jo sambodhit karata he, doosraa vah jise sambodhit kiya jaataa he, teesri sanketit vastu or chauthi-pratikatmak samvahak jo sanketit vastu kii ore pratinidhi bhangima ke saath sanket karata he
 In the process of development, the scope of language also increases
 yahi nahin ek samaaj main ek jaisi bhashaa bolne vaale vyaktiyon kaa bolne kaa dhang, unki ucchapan-prakriya, shabd-bhandar, vaakya-vinyas aadi alag-alag ho jane se unki bhashaa main paryaapt antar aa jaataa he
 This can be called style
 yon boli, vibhaasha or bhashaa kaa moulik antar bataa paanaa kathin he, kyonki isamen mukhyatya antar vyavhaar-kshetra ke vistaar par nirbhar he
 Due to individual diversity, many forms of the same language are seen in a society
 mukhya rup se bhashaa ke in roopon ko ham is prakaar dekhte hai- language, vibhaasha, or Language boli or bhashaa main antar hota he
 It is a small unit of language
 iskaa sambandh gram yaa mandal arthath simit kshetra se hota he
 In this, the predominance is through the medium of personal colloquial and there is an abundance of indigenous words and domestic vocabulary
 yah mukhya rup se bolchaal kii bhashaa he, iskaa rup kuch-kuch duuri par badalte paaya jaataa he tathaa lipibaddh na hone ke kaaran isamen saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa abhaav rahata he
 Anomalies are also found in it grammatically
 vibhaasha kaa kshetra boli kii apeksha vistrut hota he yah ek praant yaa uppraant main prachlit hoti he
 In a division, many dialects prevail on the basis of local differences
 vibhaasha main saahitiyik rachanaae mil sakati hai
 Language, or say the defined language or ideal language, is a developed state of division
 ise raashtra-bhashaa yaa taksaali-bhashaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is often seen that one of the different divisions is chosen for the Rajkarya on the basis of its merit, pride, literary growth, general publicity, etc
 and it is declared as the official language or national language

 As a result of the military, scientific, political, economic, and cultural influences of the United States in the first half of the 19th century and the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries of the British Empire, it has become a common language in many parts of the world
 kai antarrashtriya sanghathanon or rashtramandal deshon main bade paimaane par iskaa istemaal ek dwitiya bhashaa or adhikarik bhashaa ke rup main hota he
 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century

 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global

 yah sanyukt rashtraki chah aadhikarik bhashaaon main se bhi ek he
 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition

 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins

 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya

 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots

 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai

 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis
