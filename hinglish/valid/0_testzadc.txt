 Very little is known about his life
 unki kriti 'subhashitaratnakosh' prasiddh he
 Which consists of the following 50 states ayurvigyaan, vigyaan kii vah shakha he jiskaa sambandh maanav sharir ko nirog rakhane, rog ho jane par rog se mukt karne athwa uskaa shaman karne tathaa aayu badhaane se he
 It is that branch of medical science, which is concerned with keeping the human body healthy, freeing or diagnosing the disease in case of disease, and increasing age
 bharat ayurvigyaan kaa janmdata he
 In its early times, medicine was studied in the same way as a branch of biology
 baad main 'sharir rachana' tathaa 'sharir kriya vigyaan' aadi ko iskaa aadhaar banaaya gaya
 The birth of medicine in India was several thousand years BC
 It was initially studied as a branch of biology, and anatomy and physiology were made the basis of it
 sharir main honevaali kriyaaon ke gyaan se pataa laga ki unka rup bahut kuch rasinic he or ye ghatnaayen raasaanik kriyaaon ke fal hai
 As soon as the discovery took place, the chemical form of the events of the body came out
 is prakaar rasayan vigyaan kaa itnaa mahatv badha ki vah ayurvigyaan kii ek pruthak shakha ban gaya, jiskaa naam jeevarsayan rakhaa gaya
 By this, not only the form of physical events became clear, but also the origin of diseases and methods of resistance came out
 saath hi bhautik vigyaan ne bhi shaareerik ghatnaon ko bhalee bhanti samajhane main bahut sahaayta di
 It is known that many events happen according to physical rules
 ab jeevarsayan kii bhanti jeevbhautikee bhi ayurvigyaan kaa ek ang ban gai he or usase bhi rogon kii utpatti ko samajhane main tathaa unka pratirodh karne main bahut sahaayta mili he
 Other branches of science have also helped a lot in disease prevention and medicine
 or in sabake sahyog se manushya ke kalyaan main bahut pragati hui he, jiske falswaroop jeevankaal bad gaya he
 Many kinds of experimental methods and instruments, which have been made from time to time, have been very helpful in acquiring a subtle knowledge of the body, physical phenomena and internal functions related to the disease
 kintu is gahan adhyayan kaa fal yah hua ki ayurvigyaan anek shakhaon main vibhakt ho gaya or prayek shakha main itani khoj hui he, naveen upkaran bane hai tathaa praayogic vidhiyaan gyaat kii gai hai ki koi bhi vidvan yaa vidhyaarthee un sab se purnataya parichit nahin ho saktaa
 Day by day, the doctor has to depend on laboratories and equipment and this dependency is increasing progressively
 prayek shiksha kaa dhyey manushya kaa maansik vikaas hota he, jisase usamen tark karke samajhane or tadnusaar apane bhaavon ko prakat karne tathaa karyanvit karne kii shakti utpann ho jaay
 This is also the aim of medical education
 iske liye sab ayurvigyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon main vidhyaarthee ko upasnaatak ke rup main paanch varsh bitaane padate hai
 In medical colleges, students are admitted on the basis of studying the basic sciences and getting higher secondary education
 tatpashchaat pratham do varsh vidhyaarthee sharirarachana tathaa sharirkriya naamak aadharvigyaanon kaa adhyayan karata he jisase usko sharir kii swaabhaavik dasha kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 After this, three years are spent in getting knowledge of the deformities of these natural conditions due to diseases and in learning the methods of their treatment
 rogon ko rokane ke upaay tathaa bheshajavaidhik kaa bhi, jo is vigyaan kii niti sambandhi shakha he, vah isi kaal main adhyayan karata he
 After these five years of study, he becomes a graduate
 iske pashchaat vah ek varsh tak apni ruchi ke anusaar kisi vibhaag main kaam karata he or us vishay kaa kriyaatmak gyaan praapt karata he
 Thereafter, he can join a department to get a diploma or degree in postgraduate teaching
 sab ayurvigyaan mahavidhyalay kisi na kisi vishvavidhyalay se sambandhit hote hai jo unki parikshaon tathaa shikshankram kaa sanchaalan karata he or jiskaa uddeshy vigyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon main tark kii shakti utpann karnaa or vigyaan ke nae rahasyon kaa udghaatan karnaa hota he
 The aim of every teacher and student of medical schools should also be that he should try to advance the art of this antidote by searching for new anti-inflammatory items
 itnaa hi nahin, shikshakon kaa jeevanalakshya yah bhi hona chahie ki vah aise anveshak utpann karen
 The centerpiece of medical practice is the general practitioner who keeps in close contact with the public or families and helps them when needed
 vah apane rogiyon kaa mitra tathaa paramarshdaata hota he or samay par unhen darshanik santvanaa dene kaa praytn karata he
 He is familiar with simple problems related to the disease and goes to distant places, villages, etc
 and serves the patients

 Nowadays, some doctors become experts after studying a particular branch of this science
 is prakaar hridayrog, maansik rog, asthirog, ballrog aadi main visheshgyon dwaara vishisht chikitsa uplabdh he
 Nowadays medical expenses have increased a lot
 rog ke nidaan ke liye aavashyak parikshaayen, moolyavaan aushadhiyaan, chikitsa kii vidhiyaan or upkaran iske mukhya kaaran hai
 The life of the public has also increased due to modern medicine, but there is a lot of expenditure on medicines

 Man's lifetime is longer

 The government has three major health related functions

 The physician has a great place and responsibility in accomplishing these three objectives

 There were three kings named Divodas in ancient India
 pratham divodas kaashi kaa chandravanshi raja tha
 It is discussed in the Puranas
 kabhi-kabhi uske vanshaj dwitiya divodas ke saath uljhe hue rup main milte hai
 But it seems correct that the order of Pargister sir is that Haihavanshi of the first Divodas Dakshinapath was a contemporary of two kings Bhadrasrayana and Dardabha
 vah bhimrath kaa putr tha or haihayon ke akraman ke kaaran sambhavat: use apni rajdhani varanasi chhodkar ganga-gomti-sangam kii ore bhaagna padaa tha
 There was another king of the same name after three books of the first Divodas
 is dwitiya divodas ke samay haihay taljangh vanshi vitihavya ke putron ne kaashi par pun: akraman kiya or use yuddh main haraaya
 But soon his son Pratardan drove him to death
 tritiy divodas uttari panchalon kii ek shakha trits kaa raja tha or 'atithigva' uski oopaadhi thi
 His father's name was Brihadshva or Bhadrashava
 vah ek mahan yoddha or vijeta tha tathaa pauravon, yadavon or turvason se uski ladaaiyaan hui thim, pani logon or daason se bhi uske yuddh hue
 His enemy of slaves was King Shambar whom he defeated many times
 yoddha ke saath hi saath vah mahan vidvan or vaidic mantron kaa rachayita tha
 Discussions are also found in many places of Vedic literature

 The noise algorithm is a quantum algorithm for the factorization of integers that answers in polynomial time
 iske vipareet, gaiyr-kwantum computer par polinomial time main purnankon kaa gunankhand karne ke liye koi bhi algoridm gyaat nahin he
 The Strong Church Turing thesis is a philosophical argument that states that - if a computational problem can become an algorithm running in polynomial time on a computer, then there will be an algorithm running in polynomial time on a classical computer for that problem
 ; And if a problem cannot have an algorithm running in polynomial time on a classical computer, then it cannot also form an algorithm running in polynomial time on any computer for that problem
 chunki purnankon ke gunankhand ke liye kwantum computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm gyaat he, to strong carch turing thisis ke anusaar purnankon ke gunankhand ke liye ek gaiyr-kwantum computer par bhi polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm jarur hoga
 However, if one proves that a non-quantum computer for the factorization of integers cannot form an algorithm running in polynomial time, it would mean that the Strong Church Turing thesis is false

 a dividing line can be drawn between analytic concepts of social class, such as Marxist and Weberian traditions, and more empirical traditions, such as socio-economic status approaches, that combine social outcomes with income, education, and property without any specific social It informs without the necessary indication of the structure

 Due to the Industrial Revolution, a large section of the population had the same time in which they were adopting the kind of education and cultural methods which were once confined to the feudal divisions of the European aristocracy, the bourgeoisie and the peasants who joined that period Later on, the industrial proletariat of cities and towns was formed

 It is important, however, to show the distinction of this type of class model from the British class concept in which the terms upper, middle and working class have different definitions

 The Confucian model differs notably from the modern European view of social class, since merchants could obtain vast wealth even without attaining social status corresponding to a poor peasant

 tarangadairghy: 10 km to 1 km Low frequency or LF are radio frequencies that fall between 30 khz – 300 khz
 ise kilometre pattee yaa tarang bhi kehete hai
 Because its wavelength is ten to one kilometer
 a 2
1 khz allocation, the 136 khz band, is available to amateur radio operators in some countries in Europe, New Zealand and French overseas dependencies
 The world record distance for a two-way contact is over 10,000 km from near Vladivostok to New Zealand
 As well as conventional Morse code many operators use very slow computer controlled Morse code or specialized digital communications modes
 a proposal at the WRC-07 World Radiocommunication Conference aims to make this a worldwide amateur radio allocation
 The UK allocated a 2
8 khz sliver of spectrum from 71
6 khz to 74
4 khz beginning in April 1996 to UK amateurs who applied for a notice of variation to use the band on a noninterference basis with a maximum output power of 1 w ERP
 This was withdrawn on 30 June 2003 after a number of extensions in favor of the European-harmonized 136 khz band
 a 1-watt transmission of very slow Morse Code between G3AQC and W1TAG spanned the Atlantic Ocean for 3275 miles on November 21-22, 2001
 In the United States there is a special license free allocation in the longwave range called lowfer
 This experimental allocation between 160 khz and 190 khz is sometimes called the "lost Band"
 Unlicensed operation by the public is permitted south of 60 degrees north latitude, except where interference would occur to ten licensed location service stations located along the coasts
 Regulations for use include a power output of no more than 1 watt, and an antenna / ground-lead length of no more than 15 meters, and a field strength of no more than 4
9 microvolts / meter
 Also, emissions outside of the 160 khz–190 khz band must be attenuated by at least 20 db below the level of the unmodulated carrier
 Many experimenters in this band are amateur radio operators
