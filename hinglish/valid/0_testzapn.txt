 He has eight grandchildren and five grandchildren
 Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg
 Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie
 He was baptised into the Greek Orthodox Church
 His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece and the Mayor of Corfu
 Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg, then known as Louis Mountbatten, Marquess of Milford Haven, died in London
 Louis was a naturalized British citizen, who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War
 After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the greco-turkish War
 The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains
 On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, King Constantine I, was forced to abdicate, and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others
 The commander of the army, General Georgios Hatzianestis, and five senior politicians were executed
 Prince Andrew's life was believed to be in danger, and Alice was under surveillance
 In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life
 The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip being carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box
 Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of saint-cloud in a house lent to them by his aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark
 Because he left the country as a baby, he does not have a strong grasp of Greek
 In 1992 Philip said that he "could understand a certain amount of" the language
 Philip was first educated at an American school in Paris run by Donald macjannet, who described Philip as a "rugged, boisterous 


 but always remarkably polite" boy
 In 1928, he was sent to Britain to attend Cheam School, living with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle, George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire
 In the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his father moved to a small flat in Monte Carlo
 Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood
 In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the "advantage of saving school fees" because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden
 With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun school in Scotland
 After two terms at Salem, Philip moved to Gordonstoun
 In 1937, his sister Cecilie, her husband, her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 After leaving Gordonstoun in 1939, Prince Philip joined the Royal Navy, graduating the next year from the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as the best cadet in his course
 During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christopher of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side
 He was commissioned as a midshipman in January 1940
 Philip spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire and in Ceylon
 After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet
 Among other engagements, Philip was involved in the Battle of Crete, and was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights
 He was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valour
 Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia
 He was promoted to sub-lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination
 In June 1942, he was appointed to the v and w class destroyer and flotilla leader, HMS Wallace, which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the allied invasion of Sicily
 Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942
 In October of the same year he became the first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy
 During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack
 He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed
 In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS Whelp, where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla
 He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed
 In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp, and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire
 In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth
 During the visit, the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria, and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark
 Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen
 Eventually, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage
 The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April
 By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother's family, and had become a naturalised British subject
 The engagement was announced to the public on 10 July 1947
 Though Philip appeared "always to have regarded himself as an Anglican", and had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England, and throughout his Royal Navy days, Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher wanted to "regularise" Philip's position by officially receiving him into the Church of England, which he did in October 1947
 The day preceding his wedding, King George VI bestowed the style His Royal Highness on Philip and, on the morning of the wedding, 20 November 1947, he was made the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London
 Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world
 However, in post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes, some of them with Nazi connections
 After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at Clarence House
 His first two children were born: Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950
 Philip returned to the navy after his honeymoon, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty, and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich
 From 1949, he was stationed in Malta after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Chequers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet
 On 16 July 1950, he was promoted lieutenant commander and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie
 He was promoted to commander in 1952, but his active naval career ended in July 1951
 With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada
 At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the Commonwealth
 On 6 February 1952, when they were in Kenya, Elizabeth's father died and she became queen
 It was Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom
 The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house
 The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's paternal grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who himself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor
 Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this
 The Duke privately complained, "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba
 i am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children
" On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that the surname of male-line descendants of the Duke and the Queen who are not styled as Royal Highness, or titled as Prince or Princess, was to be mountbatten-windsor
 While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only eleven days before the birth of Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between the constitutional expert Edward Iwi and the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
 After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament"
 This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the Prince of Wales, except, officially, in the British parliament
 In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual State Opening of Parliament, where he walks and sits beside her
 Contrary to rumors over the years, the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign
 The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her "constant strength and guide"
 During his wife's Golden Jubilee in 2002, the Duke was commended by the Speaker of the British House of Commons for his role in supporting the Queen during her reign
 The Duke of Edinburgh's time as royal consort exceeds that of any other consort in British history; however, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who died aged 101, was the consort with the longest lifespan
 In April 2008, Philip was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital for "assessment and treatment" for a chest infection, though he walked into the hospital unaided and recovered quickly, and was discharged three days later to recuperate at Windsor Castle
 In August, the Evening Standard reported that he was suffering from prostate cancer
 Buckingham Palace, which usually refuses to comment on rumors of ill health, claimed that the report was an invasion of privacy and issued a statement denying the story
 The newspaper retracted the report and admitted it was untrue
 In June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday he said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had "done bit"
 His wife, the Queen, gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday
 While staying at the royal residence at Sandringham, Norfolk, on 23 December 2011, the Duke suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting
 He was discharged on 27 December
 On 4 June 2012, during the celebrations in honor of his wife's Diamond Jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to the King Edward VII Hospital, London, suffering from a bladder infection
 He was released from hospital on 9 June
 After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure
 In June 2013, Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital
 On 21 May 2014, the Prince appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a "minor procedure" was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day
 He is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family
 The record for the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria is currently held by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who lived to be 95 years, 6 months and 5 days old
 Prince Philip would surpass this record on 15 December 2016
 Philip played polo until 1971, when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped expand; the early rule book was drafted under his supervision
 He was a keen yachts sailor, striking up a friendship in 1949 with Uffa Fox in Cowes
 He and the Queen regularly attended Cowes Week in HMY Britannia
 His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours
 He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953
 In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of South America
 Filmed sitting alongside Philip at the aircraft's controls was his co-pilot Peter Middleton, the grandfather of the Duke's granddaughter-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge
 He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle
 Hugh Casson described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect 


 totally direct, no hanging about
 Strong colours, vigorous brushstrokes
" In 1979, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of US President Jimmy Carter, Prince Philip was approached by White House butler Lynwood Westray and another unnamed butler
 Westray asked him "your majesty, would you like a cordial?", And Prince Philip responded, "i'll take one if you'll let me serve you"
 "oh my God, this had never happened before," said Westray
 "there we were standing there
 i was holding the glasses and my buddy was holding the liqueurs and we looked at each other, and i said 'if that's the only way you'll have it, we'll go along with it
' And the prince served us what he was having, and the three of us had a drink and a conversation
 It was an honor to let him do it
 " Over his sixty years as royal consort, Philip has become famous for making remarks that were often construed as being offensive or stereotypical in nature
 Some of them were immediately interpreted as gaffes; but other awkward observations were construed by apologists as merely odd, off-colour, and often funny
 In his own words, comments attributed to Prince Philip have contributed to the perception that he is "a cantankerous old sod"
 The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of "HRH Victor Meldrew"
 For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, "no wonder you are deaf listening to this row
" Later Philip wrote, "the story is largely invention
 It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and i have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that i would do any such thing
" During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, "if you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed
" The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned
 Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed"
 His comment had no effect on sino-british relations, but it shaped his own reputation
 Philip has been a Freemason since 1953
 Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life
 Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage, and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles
 It was not, however, until the Queen issued Letters Patent in 1957 that Philip was again titled as a prince
 When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh, as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch, the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as Your Royal Highness, and thereafter as Sir
 The Duke of Edinburgh was appointed by King George VI to the Order of the Garter on 19 November 1947, the eve of his wedding
 Since then, Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth, and 48 from foreign states
 The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu also worship Prince Philip as a god; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday
 Upon his wife's accession to the throne in 1952, the Duke was appointed Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, colonel-in-chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air commodore-in-chief of the Air Training Corps
 The following year, he was appointed to the equivalent positions in Canada, and made Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom
 Subsequent military appointments were made in New Zealand and Australia
 To celebrate his 90th birthday, the Queen appointed him Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy and Canada appointed him to the highest ranks available in all three branches of the Canadian Armed Forces
 Template: Infobox COA wide Philip is the oldest living great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria, as well as her oldest living descendant following the death of Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg on 5 May 2012
 Through his descent from the British royal family, he is in the line of succession to the thrones of the 16 Commonwealth realms
 In July 1993, through mitochondrial DNA analysis of a sample of Prince Philip's blood, British scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of Empress Alexandra of Russia's family, several decades after their 1918 massacre by the Bolsheviks
 Prince Philip was then one of two living great-grandchildren in the female line of Alexandra's mother Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the other being his sister Sophie, who died in 2001
 prastaavna : Green computing refers to the promotion of policies in the field of information technology and computing which are good in terms of protecting the environment

 Initially, some of these systems were used as notification systems for services such as printing, but were soon used to facilitate communication with other users logged into the same machine
 jaise-jaise networkon kaa vikaas hua, networkon ke saath protocolon kaa bhi prasar hua
 Some of these used parallel protocols, while others needed a friend group to connect to the server (see)
 During the incident of the bulletin board system that reached the peak during the 1980s, some systems incorporated conversational features that were similar to instant messaging; The freelancing roundtable was a prime example of this

 starit shailavigyaan na keval prithvi ke dharaatal par paae janevaale shailasamoohon ke vishay main gyaan pradaan karata he, balki yah puraatan bhugol, jalwaayu or jeev jantuon kii bhi ek jhalak pradaan karata he or ham starit shailavigyaan ko prithvi ke itihaas kaa ek vivaran kah sakate hai
 Layered rock science is sometimes called historical geology, which is really just a branch of layered rock science
 itihaas main pichhali ghatnaon kaa ek kramvaar vivaran hota he; par starit shailavigyaan puraatan bhugol or vikaas par bhi prakaash daalata he
 Zoologists rely on layered rockology concerning ancestors of organisms
 vanaspativigyaani bhi puraane paudhon ke vishay main apana gyaan starit shailavigyaan se praapt karte hai
 If layered rockology was not there, the knowledge of geologists would also have been limited to the modern form of the Earth
 shilpavaigyanik ko bhi starit shailavigyaan ke gyaan ke bina andhere main hi kadam uthaane padate
 Thus layered rock science is a very detailed science which is not limited to rocks and minerals, but covers all the subjects in its periphery which are related to the earth
 starit shailavigyaan ke do niyam hai jinako starit shailavigyaan ke niyam kehete hai
 In fact, these rules, which were formulated many years ago, are unable to give complete details about layered rock science
 prithvi ke vikaas kaa itihaas manushya ke vikaas kii bhanti saral nahin he
 The history of the Earth is more complicated than the history of man
 samay ne baar baar puraane pramaanon ko mitaa dene kii cheshtaa kii he
 Over time, igneous action, metamorphosis and transfer of rock formations have also changed the form of the Earth
 is prakaar vartmaan pramaanon or upar die niyamon ke aadhaar par prithvi kaa teen arab varsh purana itihaas nahin likhaa ja saktaa
 To know the ancient history of the earth, one has to resort to many other things
 starit shailavigyaani kaa mukhya dhyey he kisi sthaan par paae janevaale shailasamoohon kaa vishleshan, namakaran, vargeekaran or vishwa ke starshailon se unki samatulyata sthapit karnaa
 He also has to give a detailed description of the ancient fauna, geography and climate
 un sabhi ghatnaon kaa jo prithvi ke janm se lekar ab tak ghatit hui hai ek kramvaar vivaran prastut karnaa hi starit shailavigyaani kaa lakshya he
 a wide area lies in the earth's aanchal
 isliye yah swaabhaavik he ki uske prayek bhaag main ek si dashaayen nahin pai jaayengi
 In the bygone era, many geological and atmospheric changes have taken place
 inhen kaarnon se kisi bhi pradesh main prithvi kaa sampurna itihaas sangrahit nahin he
 There are many shortcomings in the history of each continent
 isiilie prayek mahadweep se milanevaale pramaanon ko ekatra karke unke aadhaar par prithvi kaa sampurna itihaas nirmit kiya jaataa he
 But this is a method that cannot be fully believed and therefore it is not possible to establish exactly the same equivalence between rock formations found in different parts of the earth
 inhen kathinaaiyon ko dur karne ke liye starit shailavigyaani samatulyata ke badale samasthanik shabd prayog main laate hai jiskaa arth he vyavastha kii sadrushta
 The evolution of organisms in ancient times was not uniform and uniform
 vayumandaleey dashaayen bhi jeevvikas ke kram main parivartan laati hai
 Organisms that are found abundantly in temperate climates will not be able to survive in hot climates or there will be a huge decrease in their numbers
 hamamen se kuch ko registani jalwaayu na bhaati ho lekin bahut se log isi jalwaayu main rahete hai
 Thus, biology has not taken place in every part of the earth at one speed
 aajkal austrailia main paae janevaale kuch jeevon ke avshesh europe ke madhyajeevakalpa main paae gaye hai
 Therefore, it is not fair to say that the time of their descent on the earth is one
 isai dharm ek ibrahimi akeshwarwadi dharm he, jiske anuyaayi isai kehalaate hai
 Followers of Christianity follow the teachings of Jesus Christ

 bibal isai dharm kaa dharmagranth he
 Christians are monotheists, but they perceive God as a trinity - the God the Father, their son Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit
 parampita is sristi ke rachayita hai or iske shaasha bhi
 Who was Jesus Christ whom most people of the world worship today? isa messiah swayan parameshwar ke doot the jo patan hue sabhi manushyon ko paap or mrityu se bachaane ke liye jagat main dehdhaaran hokar aae the
 God, who is a soul, appeared in one body so that sinners do not eliminate human beings, but the sins of humans

 This was the mission of the union of sinful man and holy God, which was fulfilled by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus

 This talk shows the unwavering love of God the Father towards men
 parameshwar, sharir main aae manushyon ko paap se bachaane yah baat yishu messiah kaa parichay he
 Today's Christianity is the basis on which Jesus Christ was God
 unhone swayan kaha main hoon !!!isa messiah ek yahudee the jo israel israel ke gaanv betlaham main janme the 
 Christians believe that his mother was Maria Kuvanri
 isa unke garbh main parampita parameshwar kii krupa se chamatkaarik rup se aaye the
 Jewish prophets about Jesus predicted that a Messiah would be born
 kuch log ye maanate hai ki isa bharat bhi aaye the
 Later, Jesus conveyed a message of love among the Jews in Israel and said that he was the son of God
 in baton par puranapanthi yahudee dharmaguru bhadak uthe or unke kehane par israel ke roman rajyapal ne isa ko cross par chadh kar marane kaa prandand de diya

 The Christian Bible has two parts
 pehla bhaag or yahudiyon kaa dharmagranth ek hi hai
 The second part deals with Jesus' teachings, miracles, and the work of his disciples
 isaayiyon ke mukhya sampradaay hai : Roman Catholics consider the Pope of Rome to be the supreme leader
 protestant kisi pope ko nahin maanate he or iske bajaay pavitra bible main puri shraddha rakhte hai
 In the Middle Ages, copying was forbidden for the public to read the Bible
 jisase logo ko christi dharm kaa uchit gyaan nahin tha
 Some bishops and clergy did not understand it according to true Christianity and began to interpret the Bible in their own languages, which the Pope opposed
 un bishap or padrione pope se alag hoke ek nayaa sampradaay sthapit kiya jise protestant kehte he 
 Copimism does not believe in the right of copying or licensing
 isaki shuruyaat hui he bible ke ek vaakyansh se: Orthodox does not believe in the Pope of Rome, but accepts the Patriarch of his national creed and is a traditionalist
