 The League Council accepted the recommendation and on 16 December 1925 decided to give Mosul to Iraq

 is samjhaute ne vilnius shahar par niyantran diya, lithuania ke liye uski puraani lithuanian rajdhani, jo desh kii sarkari seat ban gayi thi
 The heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland aroused fears that they would go to war, and on 7 October 1920 the Union entered into a ceasefire with a short talk

 Mukden's accident, also known as the "manchurian Incident" or "far Eastern Crisis", was one of the Union's major failures, which served as a catalyst for Japan's withdrawal from the organization

 Any type of economic sanctions the Union imposed on its member states would become ineffective, because when a member nation was restricted from doing business with another member state, it would establish trade relations with the United States

 In addition, it also clarifies how the League of Nations can be affected by the selfishness of its members; Britain and France also feared a possible alliance between Mussolini and German dictator Hitler due to the ban not being too harsh

 However, the League was unable to provide any practical measures other than a conclusive statement that gave China "spiritual support"
 4 oktober ko, sangh sthagit ho gaya or is vishay ko nau shakti sandhi sammelan ko hastantarit kar diya gaya
 Article eight of the League's covenant gave the League the task to "limit armament to the lowest point that is necessary for national security and the enforcement of international obligations by normal action
" Much of the Union's time and energy was devoted to disarmament, although many member governments were unsure whether such widespread disarmament could be achieved, or even whether it was desirable

 The Union Covenant specified the Union to prepare a disarmament plan for each state, but the Council delegated this responsibility to the Special Commission set up in 1926 to prepare for the World Disarmament Conference of 1932–34

 The French were reluctant to reduce their weapons without a guarantee that they would be supported by military attacks

 is guarantee ke bina ve apane shastron ko kam nahin karenge kyonki unhone mahasoos kiya ki germany se akraman kaa khatra bahut zyada tha
 The threat of invasion was further heightened by Germany regaining power after World War I, especially when Hitler gained power and became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, particularly because of Germany's attempt to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German army
 France became reluctant to disarm

 In 1933, Japan, instead of accepting the decision of the Union, easily disengaged from it, as did Germany in 1933 and Italy in 1937
 In Denzing, the Union Commissioners were unable to consider the German claim on the city, which in 1939 became an important reason for the outbreak of World War II

 The onset of World War II showed that the League had failed in its initial objective, which would have avoided any future world war
 Various factors were responsible for this failure, many of which were linked to general weaknesses within the organization
 atirikt rup se, america dwaara sangh main shaamil hone kii manaahi ne sanghathan kii shakti ko simit kiya
 The emergence of the League as an organization was carried out by the Allies as part of peace efforts to end World War i and was therefore seen as a "union of Conquerors"

 Representation in the union was often a problem
 haalanki iskaa abhisht sabhi rashtron ko shaamil karnaa tha, kai kabhi shaamil nahin hue, yaa unki sangh ke saath saajhedaari bahut choti thi
 The most notable absence was the possibility of America's role in the League, not only would it secure world peace and security but also finance the Union
 US President Woodrow Wilson was the driving force behind the creation of the Union and strongly influenced its size, but the American Senate voted on 19 November 1919 not to join it
 routh heaning ne suzav diya ki yadi america sangh kaa sadsy hota to, isane france evam britain ko bhi prishth-samarthan diya hota, sambhavatya france zyada surakshit mahasoos karata evam aisa protsaahan france evam britain ko germany ke sambandh main zyada sahyog karne detaa evam isse naaji party kaa udai kam sambhav hota
 Conversely, Henning acknowledges that if the US had been a member of the Union, its reluctance to engage in war with European powers and enacting economic sanctions would have impeded the Union's ability to withstand international events

 soviet rus bhi prarambh main sangh se bahishkrut tha, kyonki pratham vishwa yuddh ke vijetaon ko communist vichaar pasand nahin tha
 The League was further weakened when important powers abandoned it in the 1930s
 japan ne sthaayee sadsy ke rup main parishad main shuru kiya, lekin 1933 main tab hat gaya jab sangh ne iske china ke manchuriya kshetra par akraman kaa virodh kiya
 Italy also started as a permanent member of the council but withdrew in 1937
 sangh ne germany ko 1926 main sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya, ise “shanti premi desh” mana, lekin adolf hitler 1933 main jab satta main aayaa to germany ko isse alag kar liya
 Another significant weakness developed from the contradiction between the idea of collective security, which was the basis of the League and international relations between individual nations
 samuhik suraksha pranali jise sangh ne prayukt kiya, kaa arth tha ki rashtron ke liye aavashyak tha ki ve un rajyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi karen jinhen ve mitra maanate hai or is tareeke se un rajyon kaa samarthan jinke saath saamaanya ghanishthata nahin thi, unke rashtriya hiton ko khatra ho saktaa he
 This weakness became evident at the time of the Abyssinia crisis when Britain and France had to make balanced efforts to maintain security in Europe, which they had built for themselves "to maintain order against the enemy of internal order" in Europe, in which Italy's support played a major role, with Abyssinia being obliged to remain a member of the Union

 In addition, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was denying itself deception by the powerful means by which its authority would be upheld

 The Puranic Turvasu is considered to be a later form of Vedic Turvash which is mentioned many times in the Rigveda along with Yadu, Sudas, Indra, Divodas and Vruchi Vantas

 jaraasandh mahabharat kaaleen magadh rajya kaa naresh tha
 He was a very powerful king and his dream was to become the Chakravati emperor
 yadhyapi vah ek shaktishaalee raja to tha, lekin vah tha bahut krur
 In order to fulfill his dream that he was invincible, he kept many kings captive in his prison
 vah mathura ke yaduwanshi naresh kansa kaa sasur evam param mitra tha uski dono putriyo asit evm praapit kaa vivaah kansa se hua tha
 He marched Mathura 17 times to take vengeance of Kansa slaughter from Sri Krishna but every time he had to fail
 jaraasandh shri krishna kaa param shatru or ek yoddha tha
 Jarasandha's father was Magadhanaresh Maharaj Brihadratha and he had two daughters
 vah dono hi ko ekasmaan chaahate the
 a lot of time passed and he was growing old, but he had no children
 tab ek baar unhone suna kii unke rajya main rishi chandkowshik padhaare hue hai or ve ek aam ke vriksh ke neeche virajman hai
 On hearing this, Rajan became hopeful and went to meet the sage
 rishi ke paas pahunch kar unhone rishi ko apana dukh kah sunaaya
 On hearing the account of the king, the sage felt pity and gave a mango to the king and asked him to feed it to his queen
 lekin chunki unki do patniyaan thi or ve dono hi se ek samaan prem karte the, isliye unhone us aam ke baraabar tukade karke apni dono raniyon ko khilaa diya
 This gave half-sons to both queens
 bhay ke maare unhone un dono tukdo ko van main phikvaa diya
 Then a demon named Zara was also going from there
 usne maans ke un donon lothdon ko dekha or usne daayan lothada daaen haath main or baayan lothada baayen haath main liya jisase vah dono tukde jud gaye
 As soon as he joined, the child roared very loudly, which frightened the little demon and ran away from the chest of both the queens in the palace
 isiilie uskaa naam jaraasandh hua
 Thus Jarasandha was born
 indraprastha nagari kaa nirmaan puraa hone ke pashchaat ek din naarad muni ne maharaj yudhisthir ko unke pita kaa yah sandesh sunaaya kii ab ve rajasuya yajna karen
 When Maharaj spoke to Shri Krishna on this subject, he also encouraged Yudhishthira to perform the Rajasuya Yajna, but there was only one obstacle in the path of Maharaj Yudhishthira becoming Chakravarti Emperor, Magadha Naresh Jarasandha, without which he could not become emperor
 Were nor could it be defeated in the battlefield
 is samasya kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye shrikrishna, bhim or arjuna ke saath brahmanon kaa bhesh banaakar magadh kii ore chal die
 After reaching there, Jarasandha considered him a Brahmin and asked him to ask for something, but at that time the Brahmin disguised Srikrishna said that now both of his friends have a silent fast which will end at half-night
 tab jaraasandh ne ardh raatri tab hi aane kaa vachan diya or unhen brahman kaksh me tehraaya
 Then at midnight he came but he had some doubts on the three that they are not Brahmins as they looked like Kshatriyas from the body, they revealed their doubts and asked them to come in their real form and recognized them
 tab shrikrishna kii khari-khoti sunne ke baad use krodh aa gaya or usne kaha kii unhen jo bhi chahie ve maang le or yahan se chale jaaen
 Then he asked to wrestle Jarasandha in Brahmin disguise itself and then gave his real introduction
 jaraasamgh ek vir yodha tha isliye usne mall yuddh ke liye bhim ko hi chunaa
 Then next he fought Malla in Mallabhoomi with Bhima
 yah yuddh lagbhag 28 dino tak chalata rahaa lekin jitani baar bhimsen uske do tukade karte vah phir se jud jaataa
 At this, Shri Krishna indicated to Bhima with the help of a stem of grass that this time he sliced it and threw both the pieces in different directions
 tab bhim ne vaisaa hi kiya or is prakaar jaraasandh kaa vadh hua
 Then by killing him, the three freed all the 86 kings locked in his prison and Sri Krishna made Jarasandh's son Sahadeva king
 sahadev ne aage chalakar ke mahabharat ke yudh me pandwo kaa saath diya

 This situation was further aggravated when, instead of friendship and unity, mutual discord and differences continued to increase in these states

 There were mutual relations between them
 ek-duusare ke saath shanti, vyapaar, sammelan or soochna laane le jane aadi kaaryon kii purti ke liye raja duuton kaa upyog karte the
 The evidence of material, charity, distinction and punishment, shoduni niti and mandal principles etc
 are proof that by this time the external relations of the states had developed
 doot is samay raja ko yuddh or sandhiyon kii sahaayta se apane prabhaav kii vruddhi karne main sahaayta dete the
 The use of diplomacy in India has been going on since ancient times
 vaidic kaal ke rajyon ke parsparik sambandhon ke bare main hamaara gyaan simit he
 Numerous examples of diplomatic activities are found in epic and mythological stories
 pracheen bhartiya rajanyik vichaar kaa kendra bindu raja hota tha, atah praayah sabhi raajnneetik vichaarkon- kautilya, manu, ashwaghosh, brihaspati, bhishma, vishakhdutt aadi ne raajaaon ke kartavyon kaa varnan kiya he
 There is also a description of the life of the king and even the rules of his routine in memory
 rajshastra, nripashaastra, rajvidya, kshatriya vidya, dand niti, niti shaastra tathaa rajdharm aadi shaastra, rajya tathaa raja ke sambandh main bodh karaate hai
 The special details related to diplomacy in Vedas, Puranas, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Kamandaka Niti Shastra, Shukraniti, etc
 are also useful in today's political context
 rugveda tathaa atharvaveda raja ko apane lakshya kii prapti ke liye jasusi, chaalaaki, chal-kapat or dhokhaa aadi ke prayog kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 In the Rigveda, Sarma, becoming Indra's daughter, goes to Paani

 He was a clever ambassador
 is prakaar puraatan kaal se hi bhartiya rajnay kaa vishisht sthaan rahaa he
 The description of available material related to diplomacy in various religious texts in ancient India is as follows: - maanav dharm par likhit manusmriti, bharat kii ek aisi ati pracheenatam kriti he, jisamen rajdooton tathaa unke kaaryon kaa vistrut varnan miltaa he
 The rules given by Manu provided for the appointment of ambassadors to maintain political relations with neighboring countries
 vah rajdoot ko bahut hi mahatv detaa tha
 The king should appoint an ambassador only to a person who knows all subjects, who can read the sentiments on the face of others and who is truthful, virtuous and of high descent
 manu us vyakti ke liye rajdoot kii niyukti par bal dete hai jo sab shastron kaa vidwaan ho, achchche vyaktitv vaala ho, dhumrapaan va madhpan se dur rahata ho tathaa jo chatur or shreshth kul kaa ho
 According to Manu, manu kaa mat he ki ek yogya va chatur rajdoot mitra rajyon main matbhed tathaa shatru rajyon ke bich mitrataa sthapit karne main safal hota he
 Manu advises the king on the use of war, only as a final weapon in the event of the imperative of war and the surety of victory
 chunki yuddh kaa parinaam anishchit hota he, atah manu raja ko paraamarsh dete hai ki use mitra, shatru athwa tatasth rajya ko kabhi bhi apane se adhik shaktishaalee nahin banane dena chaiye
 Defense of the state and destruction of enemy is the main duty of the state
 shatru se yuddh karnaa raja kaa dharm he
 They advise him to behave like a heron for the enemy's Holocaust
 iske atirikt raja ko sher kii bhaanti shaktishaalee or lomadee kii bhaanti chaalaak hona chaiye
 Manu has described in detail the foreign policy of the states
 manu kaa moulik siddhanth shadgunya mantra he, jisamen vah raja ko sandhi, vigrah, yaan, asana, dvaidhibhav or sanshray gunon ko grahan karne kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 Through this the king used to collect information
 manu ke mat main doot ke teen pramukh kaary the- par raja ke saath yuddh athwa shanti kii ghoshnaa karnaa, sandhiyaan karnaa or videshon main rahakar kaary karnaa
 The Ambassador should increase his knowledge through his spies and keep trying continuously to corrupt the greedy persons and officials of the opposing side
 pralobhan or bhent dekar soochna prapti kaa manu paraamarsh dete hai
 In fact, in ancient times, instead of opposing intelligence and intelligence, its use was emphasized
 yajyavlky smriti main rajya or praja kii raksha, raja kaa pramukh karttavya mana gaya he
 Therefore, fighting is the king's religion
 raja ko is sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi apni niti apnaani chaiye tathaa sam, daan, bhed or dand sabhi upayon kaa prayog kar siddhi praapt kerani chaiye
 In a verse of Yajnavalkya Smriti, the qualities of the king are described as Sandhi, Deity, Yan, Asan, Sambandh and Duality, that is, the king tries to befriend, enmity, attack, neglect, protect or divide with his neighboring states as per the need and situation
 Should be done
 vishwa sahitya ke pracheenatam mahakavyon kii tulana main ramayana va mahabharat utkrisht kriti hai
 There are examples related to the usefulness and immunity of diplomacy
 maharishi balmiki dwaara rachit ramayana main ram ne lanka ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke purv angad ne niti ke anusaar samjhaute kaa purna prayaas kiya tha
 Ravana's brother Vibhishan interrupted when Ravana ordered the execution due to Hanuman's burning of Lanka, saying that according to the scriptures, the slaughter of the messenger is anti-policy, he cannot be punished, no matter what kind of crime he may commit
 vibhishana ko apane paksh main karnaa tathaa ravan ke darbar main gatividhiyon kii jaankaree praapt kar lenaa, kushal rajanyik yogyata kaa parichaayak he
 He was captured when Shuk demon came to find out the secret of Rama's army, but Rama left him because Shuk had declared himself to be Ravana's messenger
 is prakaar is kaal main doot bhejne kii pratha thi tathaa inkaa mukhya kaary sandeshon kaa laana, le janaa tathaa jasusi karnaa tha
 In the Ayodhya episode, King Dasaratha advises Rama that the king should try to find the truth through the messengers
 tulsidas ne ramcharita maanas main sam, daan, bhed or dand chaaron upayon kaa varnan kiya he
 Mahabharata is a major tool for studying our ancient political and cultural history
 ramayana kii bhaanti mahabharat bhi nitishastra kii aisi pustak thi jiskaa adhyayan kar raja swayan ke rajya ke hiton kii raksha ke liye kaary kar saktaa tha
 The Gita has given many names to the Gita, including ethics, ethics, duty, etc
 gita ke upadesh raajnneeti ke ucchtam adarsh ke rup main dekhe jate hai
 By this time diplomacy had developed
 mahabharat main duuton kaa varnan miltaa he
 It emphasizes the need of messengers and detectives for the success of the regime
 doot keval vahi vyakti niyukt ho saktaa tha jo kuleen vansh kaa, priy vachan kehane vaala, acchhee smriti vaala or yathoktvaadi ho
 It is described in Shantiparva that through messengers the state should acquire knowledge of the desired subject of both its enemies and friends
 sanjan ne vibhinn avasaron par doot kaa kaary kiya tha
 As a special envoy from the Pandavas, Shri Krishna had gone to the court of King Duryodhana of the Kauravas to reach a compromise between the two sides, so that there would be no future war
 draupadi dwaara aise asambhav kaary ke auchity ke sambandh main poochne par shrikrishna ne jo uttar diya vah rajnay se paripurna tha
 Shri Krishna was of the opinion that even though he failed to avert war, he would show to the world that he was justified and doing injustice to Kauravas
 isi sandarbh main unhone kaha tha ki- In this context, Shri Krishna had said that "I will protect not only my own but also the interests of the Kauravas in front of the nation
" ” Krishna was a great scholar of war and politics
 dharmraj yudhisthir va arjuna ko diye gayi niti pravachan, krishna ke yogya evam adarsh rajdoot hone ke dyotak hai
 Bhishma Pitamah has described the qualifications of the messenger
 unke anusaar vah purush jo daksh, priy bhashi, yathoktvaadi or acchhee smriti vaala ho vahi doot niyukt kiya ja saktaa he
 The king should not kill the messenger under any circumstances
 "doot ko maarane vaala mantriyon sahit narkagami hoga
 "the words given by Bhishma Pitamah in the last moments throw a good light on the king and diplomacy
 mahabharat main ucch saadhy kii prapti main sabhi prakaar ke sadhano ke upyog kaa samarthan he
 Shantiparva is full of diplomacy and consultation of war and peace
 vanaparv main vijay prapti hetu sabhi saadhan maanya bataaye gayi hai
 Kshatriya religion is above and beyond morality
 ye dono mahakavy shashan, rajnay, yuddh or shanti par likhe gayi mahatvapurn granth hai
 Thus the institutional form of diplomacy emerged in the Ramayana and Mahabharata periods
 ramachandra dikshitaar ke anusaar rajnay is samay purna viksit ho chukaa tha
 The Mauryan period can be called the golden period of Indian diplomacy
 is kaal main duuton ko bhejne kii pratha anterrashtriya sambandhon kaa ek bhaag ban chuki thi
 Along with international relations, international relations had also developed
 duuton kaa sthaayee va asthaayee rup se aadan-pradaan hota tha
 In the court of Chandragupta Maurya, Magasthenes and Samudragupta's court had emissaries of the Sinhala king
 isi prakaar bharat kii ore se china va rome ko doot bheje gayi the
 The job of these messengers was basically to obtain business facilities
 rajtarangini main bhi videshon main duuton kii niyukti kaa varnan he
 Magasthenes's book 'indika' describes the political conditions of Mauryan India
 bindusaar ke rajya kaal main syria ke raja antiocus ne diamekas naamak vyakti ko tathaa misr ke raja tolemi ne dionysius ko apane doot ke rup main bheja tha
 Emperor Ashoka established relations with the countries of Lanka, Egypt, Syria, Macedon, etc
 and sent his son Mahendra and daughter Sanghamitra to Lanka as apostles
 maury shaskaon tathaa pulakeshin dwitiya ke faras ke raja khusro parvej ke saath tathaa harshavardhan ke china ke saath sambandh the
 The system of exchange of ambassadors was fully established
 is prakaar rajnay ko rajya shilp kaa hi ek bhaag mana jaataa tha
 Diplomacy was the basic basis of international relations
 bhartiya rajshastra ke chaar prasiddh aadharbhoot siddhanth sam, daan, bhed or dand rajyon ke parsparik sambandhon ko, prachinkaal kii bhanti aaj bhi nirdhaarit karte hai
 They have been called 'chaturpad' in ethics
 sam kaa arth mitrataa tathaa anunay he
 Under this rule of diplomacy, the opposition king was kept friends with oratory and diplomatic skill ie logic and humility
 vijigishu raja ko is niti kaa paalan karnaa chaiye
 If the policy of Sama is successful but still does not yield full results, Kautilya advises following the policy of charity
 daan kaa arth he dena
 Under the donation principle, greed and greed are offered to join the enemy
 rajnay main kuch diye bagaiyr praapt nahin hota he
 Therefore, if the state wants to get something, it will have to give something
 sam va daan arthath anunay or samjhaute main asafal rahane par bhed athwa foot daalane kaa praytn kiya ja saktaa he
 It was the king's ultimate duty to increase his influence by making it weak in the enemy's side
 kautilya ke anusaar bhed daalane ke kaary ke antargat padosi rajyon ko uttejit karnaa athwa pratishthit nagarikon or adhikariyon ko vidroh ke liye prerit karnaa tha
 It is only after the failure of the above mentioned three measures that the use of the fourth measure, ie, punishment, is consulted
 manu bhi yathasambhav antim astr ke rup main hi uske prayog kii chhot dete hai
 According to Manu, one should try to conquer the enemy by experimenting with one or all of these three things, and not with war
 in teenon upayon ke dwaara jab siddhi praapt na ho tab dand kaa aashray lenaa uchit hoga
 Numerous examples available in ancient Indian history attest to this fact
 sabhi yugon main apane uddeshy kii purti ke liye dand kii vyavastha rahi he
 Punishment also meant diplomatic warfare
 nishkarsh rup main yah kaha ja saktaa he ki pracheen kaal se hi sam, daan, bhed or dand kaa prayog hota chalaa aa rahaa he
 The modern era is no exception to this
 rajnay ke kshetra main kautilya kaa mahan yogadan he
 In fact, Kautilya and diplomacy are synonymous
 kautilya arestu kaa samakaleen tha
 Its real name was Vishnugupta
 itihaas main vah chanakya ke naam se prasiddh he
 Chanakya was the Rajguru and counselor of Chandragupta Maurya
 chanakya ne 326 i0 pus0 main sikandar ke akraman se utpann aantarik araajaktaa tathaa hindu vyavastha ke vighatan kii sthiti main mauryvansh ke prathak samraat chandragupta ke path pradarshan ke liye ‘narendra hetu’ ek prasiddh pustak 'arthshaastra' kii rachana kii thi
 Kautilya's original objective in the creation of this book was to bring political integration of India through the Sashakta Rajatantra
 ye apane dhang kii ek aisi anokhi pustak he jise bharat kii raajnneeti shaastra kii pratham pustak kaha ja saktaa he
 In this, politics has been discussed as independent science
 rajya vyavastha ke sanchaalan hetu kautilya dwaara prastut paraamarsh ke aadhaar par hi maury shaasha ek vishaal samrajya sthapit karne main safal ho sake the
 With this help, Chandragupta Chakravarti became emperor
 rajya shaastra ke sahitya main is vishisht, adwitiya tathaa apurv granth kaa mahatv chirantan he
 In it, along with a deep study of important subjects like high order governance, government, kings and ethics, in the sixteenth chapter of the first section, the work of diplomats and ambassadors is described in detail
 iskaa saatvaan khand videsh niti, sandhiyon or rashtriya hiton kii raksharth vishyon se sambandhit he
 Two conclusions can be drawn from the study of economics
 pratham, kisi bhi desh kii niti ke gunon kaa moolyankan unke dwaara sampadit kaaryon ke parinaamon ke aadhaar par kiya ja saktaa he
 The wrong results of best wishes are indicative of bad policy
 dwitiya, raajnneeti kii prerana tathaa unke parinaam donon hi chunki maanav dwaara nirmit hai atah paricalneey he
 Kautilya first introduced to India the rules of systematic and established diplomacy
 nishchay hi pracheen bharat, rajanyik vyavastha main paripakv tha
 The rules given by this can be implemented even today after simple changes, although they were constructed thousands of years ago
 kautilya vartmaan arthvyavasthe kaa sansthaapak tha
 He presented state relations as a 'power struggle' between nations
 kautilya kaa uddeshy sudrudh or shaktishaalee rajya kii sthapana karata tha
 Therefore, he advised the king to increase his physical strength, and be persistent in this direction
 chandragupta maury tathaa samudragupta kii nitiyon main yatharthwaad kaa prakat ansh paaya jaataa he
 As a result of its realistic policies, Chandragupta was successful in establishing the empire and stabilizing politics at that time
 apni yathartwaadee nitiyon ke aadhaar par hi kautilya margentho ke yathartwaadee skool kii sthapana karne waalon kaa pitamah tathaa bismark iskaa yogya shishy mana ja saktaa he
 Kautilya wanted to concentrate all the power of the rule in the king
 atah uske vichaar kaa mul kendra bindu raja hi tha
 Kautilya expected the king to hide his wealth and resources from the enemy like a turtle, so that the enemy side could not estimate its power correctly
 usne raja ko sarvocch sthaan pradaan kiya he
 He believed that the growth and decline of the kingdom depended on the merits and demerits of the king
 kautilya kaa, jo ki ek shashakt bharat ke nirmaan kaa icchhuk tha, chandragupta maury kii bhaanti yah vishwaas tha ki aisa chatur upayon- sam, daan, bhed or dand dwaara hi sambhav he
 Because the system and problems of a state are different, the state can use multiple of specified quadratic conditions to suit its different conditions
 kautilya ke rajnay kaa uddeshy vijigishu rajya ko vijay praapt karaane, rajanyik vyavhaar kaa vikaas tathaa use sthaayee banane main sahaayta dena bhi tha
 There were seven elements of Kautilya's use of diplomacy - Swami, Amatya, Janpad, Durg, Kosh, Dand and Mitra
 kautilya ne is sabhi kaa vistrut varnan kiya he
 Swami means the king was the center of all this
 iske pad ke apane adhikaar or uttardaayitv the
 Kautilya gives importance to protecting the life of the king to keep the king and the kingdom powerful and safe
 raja kaa durg chaharadivari or chaaron ore khai se purna rakshit hona chaiye
 In the words of Ghoshal "personal security to the king is the key to the security of the state
 " arthshaastra bhi raja ko apane rajya kii suraksha tathaa prabhusatta ko banaaye rakhane ke liye nirantar prayatnsheel rahane kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 In the history of Indian diplomacy, the system of Kautilya is a symbol of realism
 vaideshik niti kaa sanchaalan shadgunya siddhanth ke anusaar chalata tha
 According to Kautilya - The basic objective of foreign policy is to get supreme power by the king and to deprive his enemy from him
 raja ko aisi niti apnaani chaiye jisase uske swayan ke hit kaa sanvardhan tathaa shatru ko haani ho
 If the neighboring state is weak or its military power is weak, then the king should help him as needed, praise him, make permanent or temporary treaty with him and achieve his purpose
 padosi rajya ke saath mitrataa athwa sthaayee maitri sambandhon ko banane ke liye kautilya ne in rajyon kii kanyao ke saath vaivaahik sambandhon kii sthapana par bhi bal diya he
 According to him, powerful king should never be ignored
 apni seemaa par ek kamjor shatru bhi hanikaarak hota he
 Kautilya has given a special definition of the enemy - the enemy is the one who is on the border of his country and the friend is the one who is on the border of the state situated on the border of your country
 kautilya kaa mat tha ki seemaa par sthit shaktishaalee desh bhavishya kaa sambhavit shatru he
 It is the duty of diplomacy to end its hostility, because the presence of a permanent enemy on the border can prove detrimental to the country
 shaktishaalee rajya ke sambandh main kautilya kaa paraamarsh tha ki uske prati asthaayee kaal ke liye ‘upeksha’ kii niti kaa prayog karnaa chaiye
 In the intervening period, the king should create differences with the help of detectives to weaken the enemy side
 is bich shaktishaalee rajyon ke nijee sangharshon, sandhiyon athwa guton ke prati tatasthta kii niti apnaani chaiye athwa shaktishaalee rajya kaa samarthan karnaa chaiye
 Kautilya was of the opinion that if possible, a weak or shelterless enemy should be assimilated and develop its power continuously
 is prakaar kautilya raja ko shakti santulan kii niti ko apanaakar apni suraksha or apana maan tathaa dhan badhaane kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 It is noteworthy that not only inspired by the diplomatic ideals described by Kautilya, he kept only concrete and real results in view
 yahi kaaran he ki kautilya raja ko shatru paksh ke prati ‘upeksha’ ke saath-saath ‘maaya’ va ‘indrajaal’ arthath jasusi ke upyog kaa bhi paraamarsh detaa he
 Additionally, Kautilya gives two more important advisories to the king regarding politics
 pratham, desh kii niti purna rup se suvyavasthit evam janakalyankari honi chaiye
 Second, there should be a timely change in the policy that does not benefit the enemy
 kautilya raja ko jahaan tak sambhav ho sake shaanti kaa maarg apnaane kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 When there is hope for equal benefits from peace and war, the policy of peace will be more beneficial, because in war there is always wastage of power and money
 isi prakaar jab tatasthta or yuddh se samaan laabh ho, tatasth niti hi adhik laabhprad va santoshprad hogi
 Kautilya was of the view that in the event of failure of peaceful measures, each state puts war as an option
 panikkar ke shabdon main vastav main jab sabhi praytn asafal ho gayi hon, tathaa sabhi paristhitiyaan shastron ke prayog ke liye anukool hon, tabhi yuddh kii niti ke rup main jari rakhana vichaarneey he
 In ancient India, the policy of avoiding war as soon as possible was followed
 udaahranarth chandragupta jaise shaktishaalee raja ne celucus jaise durbal padosi raja ke saath bhi aakraamak niti kaa paalan nahin kiya tha
 Kautilya has described three types of war - Prakash Yudh, Pud Yudh and Trishan War
 rajya kii pratiraksha ke liye kautilya ne durg vidhaan kaa mahatv pradarshit kiya he
 The force or army was the principal weapon of the Weeks state
 kautilya rajya kii suraksha tathaa samruddhi ke uddeshyon kii prapti ke liye naitikta ko gaun maanata tha
 Kautilya's deception, deceit, treachery, violence and war reflected his realism, sharp intellect and love of nation
 is sabake baavjood, kautilya raja ko dharm-virdohi va atyaachaari nahin hone detaa he
 He allows the kingdom to be free, but advises the king to follow the established principles of the scriptures and ethics at all costs
 vah guptchar sena ke upyog ko rajya kii raksharth aavyak samajhataa tha
 He advises the renunciation of morality in dealing with dissident elements, traitors and foreign enemies
 kautilya shashan kala tathaa raja va rajya ke hit main aniatik kaary tathaa shatru va aparaadhiyon ko dhokhe se marava daalane ko bhi nyyochit tehraata he
 Kautilya, being a realist, did not value moral values ahead of the interest of the state
 vah yah bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa tha ki naitikta ke aadhaar par rajya nahin tik sakate hai
 He was a supporter of the use of religion to fight foreigners
 vah mandiron athwa devataaon kii murti main shastr chhipaakar rakhane kaa samarthak tha, puja par aaye raja kaa vadh kiya ja saktaa tha, ek shaktiheen raja dwaara shaktishaalee raja ke viruddh gupt shadyantron or hatyaon ke upyog kaa vah samarthak tha
 According to him, morality and religion were desirable to overcome the enemy
 vah naitikta ko, saiddhanthik drushti se moolyawaan maanate huye bhi, vyaavhaarik drushti se uske anupayogi hone ke kaaran, tyajya maanata he
 Kautilya has elaborated on the qualifications, types, duties, ethics etc
 of the messengers
 kautilya ne rajyon kii bahya niti ke sanchaalan main doot kaa vishesh mahatv mana he
 Kautilya considered the messenger the 'king's face'
 isi ke madhyam se rajyon ke madhya parsparik vaarta-vinimay chalata tha
 Kautilya divides the messengers into three categories - Nisrishtartha, Parimarthar and Rajahar
 amatya pad kisi bhi doot kii shrenee main nirdhaaran kaa maapdand hota tha
 The messenger with the qualification of the rank of demigod was called Nisharthartha, the one who had three-fourth qualification and the half-qualified ruler
 nisrushtarth shrenee ke doot kaa kaary apane raja kaa sandesh duusare raja ke samaksh prastut karnaa hota tha
 In respect of all contentious problems, such ambassador had full rights
 udaahranarth shrikrishna kauravon ke paas nisrushtarth doot ke rup main bheje gayi the
 This statement of Shri Krishna confirms the fact - i will go to Hastinapur as a peacekeeper and declare war if the peace effort fails
 is prakaar nisrushtarth doot ko vaarta ke purnadhikaar praapt the
 We can consider this type of messenger like the present-day ambassador
 parimitarth doot ke adhikaar nisrushtarth doot se kam hote the
 This messenger had the right to hold talks only within the limits given by the king
 vah apane nirdeshon se baahar nahin ja saktaa tha
 The ruler who used to be a third-class messenger was a messenger only
 iskaa pramukh kaary raajaaon ke madhya sandeshon kaa aadan-pradaan karnaa hota tha
 It had no rights of any kind; At the end of their work the messengers used to return to their country
 'pracheen bharat main anterrashtriya kanoon' ke ek lekh main vishwanath ne mat prakat kiya he ki is kaal main sthaayee duuton kii niyukti kii pratha kaa prarambh nahin hua tha
 The messengers were temporarily appointed for a short period of time
 kautilya ek anya prakaar ke 'anadhikrut doot' kaa bhi varnan karata he jo rajanyik vyavhaar kaa vikaas he
 This messenger used to work from both the sides, taking salary from his king and par-king
 ise kaamandak ne 'ubhayvetan bhogi doot' kii sangya di he
 Kautilya gives importance to the moral character of the person and his personality in the appointment of the envoy
 uske mat main jahaan tak sambhav ho apane hi rajya ke naagarik ko doot niyukt kiya janaa chaiye
 Part 16 of Arthashastra, Chapter 16 mentions instructions regarding the conduct of the messenger
 kautilya ke anusaar doot ko par-rajya main purna vaibhav se rahanaa chaiye, kyonki vah videsh main swadesh ke vaibhav evam gaurav kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The messenger should obtain the king's orders at the time of entering the kingdom
 ajna milane ke pashchaat hi doot ko purna sammaan ke saath ek juluus main raja ke samaksh prastut kiya jaataa tha
 It was given a place to sit near the king
 donon paksh ek-duusare kii pratishtha ko drushtigat rakhte hue ek-duusare ke prati sammaan prakat karte the
 The messenger used to narrate the message of his king in the court
 kautilya doot ke liye kuch nishedhajnaayen bhi detaa he
 For example, the messenger should refrain from expressing happiness, displaying his force, speaking profanity, sexual intercourse and drinking in response to the hospitality received in the state
 iske atirikt use na to akele sona chaiye or na hi guptbhed ke sambandh main baaten kerani chaiye
 Even after these precautions, if the king is displeased with the messenger and as a result of which there is some possibility of his slaughter, then he should flee immediately as soon as he gets the information
 kautilya ne duuton ke kaary kaa vistrut vivaran prastut kiya he
 The ambassador's original task was to maintain peaceful relations between the two states
 kautilya ne doot ke do prakaar ke kaaryon kaa ullekh kiya he- pratham, shaantikalin kaary, dwitiya sankatkalin kaary
 Under them, it is the duty of the messenger to keep his king's message in front of the king
 kautilya ke anusaar apriy sandesh ko sunakar doot ke vadh hetu shastr uthaa lene par bhi doot ko apane raja kaa sandesh yathokt hi kahana chaiye
 The first duty of the messenger is to bring the message of his king to the kings of the per-kingdom and present them as appropriate to him
 kautilya ke anusaar doot ko samay or paristhiti ke anusaar kaary karnaa chaiye, jaise apane uddeshy kii prapti ke liye anya duuton va janapadon se mitrataa, shatru paksh main vibhed, chapalusee athwa ghoose aadi sabhi sadhano kaa prayog karnaa chaiye
 In the state, the pride of the clan in honor of their king, his opulence, renunciation, prosperity, fidelity, impudence, gentleness, ability to comfort the enemy, etc
 should be exerted on the people there
 saath hi vahaan ke kosh, shakti aadi ko bhi samarthy tathaa shatru kii durbalataaon, unke sainik thikaanon, sainik yogyataon, durgon, suraksha vyavastha, sadakon, nadi-naalon aadi kaa vistaar se varnan kar, apane desh kii vyavastha se tulana kar apane swami ko yogya paraamarsh dete rahanaa chaiye
 His task was to make treaties, increase friendships, trace activities to foreign spies and also inform all of this to his kingdom
 kautilya sankatkalin sthiti main doot se apeksha karata he ki use par-rajya ke asantusht varg ko apni ore milaane kaa nirantar praytn karte rahanaa chaiye
 If all his peaceful efforts fail and the enemy king starts preparing for an attack, then the public should try to provoke divisions, differences and revolution in the state by provoking the people against the king
 shatru ke madhya vaimnasy or jhagadon ke beej bone ke liye guptcharon kaa khulaa prayog karnaa chaiye
 According to Kautilya, the work of the messengers is also to lure the higher authorities to lure them to leave the state one by one
 is uddeshy kii prapti hetu apane guptcharon ko vaidya, vyapaaree, jyotishi, tirthayatri, shikari, raja ke sevak, rasoiyon tathaa sadhu aadi ke rup main bhejnaa, uskaa pramukh kaary he
 Prostitutes and dancers were also often employed as detectives
 kabhi-kabhi rajmahal main striyaan, tambul yaa chhatra-vahikaaon kaa pad bhi praapt kar leti thi taaki unhen raja ke sameep rahakar rajya kii antarang gatividhiyon kaa bhed nirantar miltaa rahe
 The messenger should also be aware of the power of the prisons and land routes and fortifications of the state
 senaaon ke thaharne yogya bhoomi, raaston kaa gyaan, durg or shastron aadi kii soochna apane raja ke paas nirantar bhejte rahanaa chaiye, jisase ki is soochna kaa sankat kaal main upyog kiya ja sake
 Kautilya advises the use of detectives to do all these tasks
 aaltekar ke shabdon main doot kaa kaary videshon main raaj purushon se jaan-pahchaan karke us desh kii vaastavik raajnneeti kii jaankaree praapt karnaa tha
 To gain knowledge of the general condition of the state, to estimate its mass, force and other means properly, through its detectives, was to send it to its government by esoteric text
 kautilya ne doot kii abadhyataa kaa purna samarthan kiya he
 He was of the opinion that no matter what unpleasant thing the messenger says or belongs to any caste, he is irrational in every stage
 kautilya, brahman doot kaa to kisi bhi paristhiti main vadh sweekaar nahin karata he
 When the enemy king is angry, the messenger should remind the king that some unpleasant message he is giving is of his king
 doot raja kaa pratinidhi hota he, atah apriy sandesh ko dete tathaa apane kartavya kii purti karte hue rajdoot ko sajaa nahin milani chaiye
 Thus the ambassador's position in this period was that of a holy and innocent messenger
 maury raajnneeti vyavastha main guptcharon kaa khulaa upyog hota tha
 Kautilya made this system even more efficient and made it an integral part of the state system
 usne aantarik tathaa bahya donon hi kshetron main guptcharon kaa upyog prastaavit kiya tha
 There is many proofs of the fact that their web was spread throughout the empire and neighboring countries
 kautilya ne bataaya he ki guptcharon ko kapalik, bhikshu, vyapaaree aadi ke rup main videshon main rahakar suchnaayen praapt kerani chaiye
 They also served to divide and incite rebellion
 sandhiyon kaa aadhaar mandal siddhanth ko, arthath apane padosi ke saath shatruta tathaa padosi ke padosi ke saath mitrataa kaa vyavhaar apekshit tha
 Kautilya mentions six types of policies under statecraft, treaty, Deity, vehicle, doubt and dualism
 kautilya ne in nitiyon main sandhi kaa sarvapratham ullekh karke uske mahatv ko darshaya he
 He considered each valid treaty to be important and inviolable
 vah sandhi kii pavitrataa hetu shapath kii prakriya ko aavashyak samajhataa tha
 Kautilya has described fifteen types of treaties
 sandhi kii vyakhya karte hue usne likhaa he ki sandhi vah he jo raajaaon ko parsparik vishwaas main bandhti he
 Or the treaty is the motivator of mutual trust of kings
 saral bhashaa main, do rajyon ke madhya maitri sambandh sthapit hone kaa naam sandhi he
 Sandhi was used as a major part of Kautilya's diplomacy
 kautilya, sandhi dwaara shanti sambandh banaaye rakhane kaa samarthak tha
 From this point of view, he was in favor of such flexible terms of the treaty which would help in achieving the objective of peace-making as well as making the enemy king weak and powerful
 kautilya kaa mat tha ki ek raajnneetijna ko yathartwaadee hona chaiye na ki swapnlok main vicharne vaala
 He considers the treaty convenient
 uske anusaar unhen tabhi tak maananaa chaiye jab tak ve apane rajya ke hit main hon, tatpashchaat rajanyik vyavhaar kaa vikaas unka ulanghan mananeey he
 Kautilya allows the treaty to violate the losing king to regain his power
 is prakaar kautilya sandhi ke kshetra main do prakaar ke vyavhaar ko bataata he- suraksha sandhiyaan aparivartaneey hoti hai or anya sandhiyaan ulalanghaneey
 Kautilya's standard of morality is extraordinary
 kautilya pakkaa bhautikwaadi tha
 In order to achieve his objective he considered the renunciation of morality right
 vah naitikta or dharm ko uddeshy prapti main sahaayak maanata tha
 His ultimate objective was national interest
 un arajak paristhitiyon main, jinamein usne arthshaastra ke madhyam se raja ko paraamarsh diya he shaanti, suraksha, swatantrata or saarvbhaumikta kii raksha keval shakti or yukti se hi sambhav thi
 It is noteworthy that saving yourself from destruction is the highest religion
 is uddeshy kii purti ke liye apanaaye jane yogya niyam kautilya kii rajnay kii ek bahut badi dein he
 The sole objective before him in the formulation of diplomatic rules was to strengthen the national interest and the monarchy
 naitikta kaa tyaag or dharmanirpekshata kaa maarg isi uddeshy se prerit tha
 Kautilya had greatness in this
 ant main kaha ja saktaa he ki kautilya vah pratham vichaarak tha jisane rajnay kaa sangopang vivechan va vishleshan kiya
 The ideas we get earlier regarding diplomacy, do not get seriality, orderliness and scientific vision like Kautilya
 kautilya dwaara pratipaadit rajnay sambandhi vichaaron ke aadhaar par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki bharat main rajnay kaa sampoorntah vivechan karne vaala sarvapratham vyakti kautilya hi he
 After Kautilya's Arthashastra taken in relation to state and governance, Kamandikeya and Shukra Nitisar have an important place
 kaamandak ke nitisar main vishnudutt kii prashansa pramanit karti he ki lekhak ke vichaar chanakya se prabhavit the
 Like Kamandaka's policy, kings have been written for education like kautilya
 isamen raja kii shiksha, rajya ke vibhinn angon, yuddh kala, rajya kii suraksha or antarraji sambandhon aadi kaa vivaran he
 Kamandaka gives the king the highest important position
 usne raja ke gunon or durganon kaa varnan kiya he
 Kamandaka has advised the use of shodunya siddhanta and the use of measures like sama, charity, distinction and punishment
 uske anusaar usee vyakti kaa doot niyukt kiya janaa chaiye jo chatur, budhimaan, parishramee or tark ke aadhaar par kaary karne vaala ho
 The basic work of the messenger is to gain knowledge of the foreigner and inform the king
 vah doot ko raja kii ankhen maanata he
 That is why Kamandaka considers a king devoid of messengers as a blind man
 vah guptcharon ko bhi doot kahata he
 Shukracharya mentions the advisories of making the king successful and capable in the Venus policy
 iske chauthe adhyay main raja, shatru, shashan-kala aadi kaa varnan he
 Venus has considered the minister's eye, the friend's ear, the friend's mouth, the army's mind, the fort's hand the arm, and the nation's foot's foot
 shukr ke anusaar sampoorn rajya vyavastha main raja kaa mahatv rajya ke sabhi angon se badhkar he
 Like Kautilya, Venus also detailed the king's routine and mentioned enemies, friends, moderate and indifferent kings
 rajya kii raksha ke liye durg vyavastha par bal diya gaya he
 According to Venus, the messenger is also one of the ministers of kings
 vahi vyakti doot banane yogya he jo acchhee smriti vaala, deshkal kaa gyaata, yogya, kushal or nirbhik ho
 In Kiratarajuniyam, the messenger is considered the eye of the king and he has been advised that he should not cheat the king
 sandhi ko bhang karne ke liye raja sandhi main dosha bataa saktaa he
 The king who breaks such a treaty is not guilty
 vivek or shanti raja ke gun bataaye gayi hai
 The king should renounce anger, arrogance and the item
 dravid sahitya main tiruvalluvar ke granth ‘kural’ main rajdooton par ek puraa adhyay likhaa gaya he
 An ideal ambassador should be highly descended, soft-tempered and well-decorated
 ek anya sthaan par adarsh rajdoot main aakarshak vyaktitv hone kii apeksha kii gai he
 Strong loyalty to his master and loyalty to the foreign king is considered an integral part of his ethos
 kural main shatru ke viruddh sadhiyon par bal diya gaya he
 The powerless states should make peace with their neighboring powerful states and maintain friendship
 tamil videsh niti or rajnay kaa aadhaar yatharthata hi tha
 Somdev's book 'neetavakyamrit' is a storehouse of diplomatic knowledge
 vah raja ko 'paramdev' maanata he
 It is his duty to protect the state and distribute fair justice
 isane raja kii dincharya kaa varnan kiya he
 Somdev places the messengers, like Venus, as ministers
 duuton kii yogyata kaa varnan karte hue somdev unase apeksha karata he ki unhen vakpatu, kuleen, pratibha sampann, daksh or budhimaan hona chaiye
 He also described three types of messengers
 nissatarth, parimitarth or shashanhaar
 He only gives first class messengers the right to make treaties
 doot kaa kartavya he ki vah par-rajya main foot daal asantusht varg ko apane rajya ke paksh main kare tathaa yogya guptchari se shatru-paksh kii sampoorn jaankaree praapt kar apane swami ko suchit kare
 Somdev's 'niti Vakyamrit' advises that no matter what messenger Chandal is, or how wrong he may be, he is incurable
 ‘nitiprakashika’ main mahakavyon kii bhaanti doot kii avadhyataa ke siddhanth ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 Chandeshwar also prohibited the slaughter of the messenger
 harshavardhan ne chini yatri hunsang ko doot ke baraabar maanakar uski vaapisi par uski suraksha kii puri vyavastha kii thi
 The stories of 'panchatantra' and 'hitopadesh' were also composed to train the kings in the state craft
 ye kahaniyaan us samay ke bharat kii raajnneetik tathaa rajanyik paristhitiyon ko pratibimbit karti hai
 The Hitopadesh describes sixteen types of treaties
 yah pavitra puja sthanon ko guptchari kaa kendra ke rup main upyog kaa bhi paraamarsh detaa he
 The Panchatantra is also a supporter of intelligence
 ‘mudrarakshas’ main raajaaon va mantriyon ke paatro ke madhyam se kahi gayi baaten rajnay se paripurna hai
 The minister of Mithila king in his work 'rajneeti Ratnakar' has given the basis of divisional principles of Raj's brahmniti
 yah bhi shadgunya siddhanth or sam, daan, bhed or dand ke upayon ke prayog kaa paraamarsh detaa he
 In this way, the works of Veda, Purana, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Arthashastra, Jataka, Rajatarangini etc
 give a detailed description of diplomacy
 manu, yajyavallay, kautilya, kaamandak, shukr aadi rajshastriyon ne vistaar se raja, mantri, sabha, parishad, antarraji sambandhon, sena, doot, durg aadi kaa varnan kiya he
 Sincere adherence to the advice given by them can be helpful in empowering any king
