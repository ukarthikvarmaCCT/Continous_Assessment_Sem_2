 khel, bachche kii swaabhaavik kriya he
 Children of different age groups play different types of games
 ye vibhinn prakaar ke khel bacchon ke sampurna vikaas main sahaayak hote hai
 The game promotes children's physical development, cognitive development, emotional development, social development and moral development, but parents' negative attitude towards the game and activities are severely affected
 atah yah anivaary he ki shikshak or mata-pita khel ke mahatv ko samajhen
 Types of games include exploratory games, structural games, fantasy games and guided games
 khelon main saanskrithik vibhinnataayen bhi dekhi jaati hai
 Sports fulfill man's psychological needs and he also gives man an opportunity to develop social skills
 piyaaje ke anusaar khel bacchon kii maansik kshamtaaon ke vikaas main bhi ek badi bhoomika nibhaate hai
 In the first stage, the child tries to get sensation with objects and conduct tasks
 duusare charan main baccha kalpanaaon ko rup dene ke liye vastuon ko kisi ke pratik ke rup main upyog karne lagata he
 In the last stage, the child engages in a game of rules as compared to games of fictional roles
 khelon se taarkik kshamta va skool sambandhi kaushalon ko viksit hone main madad milti he
 According to Vygotsky - Games with complex roles give children a better and safer opportunity to organize their behavior than they do in real situations
 is tarah khel bachche ke liye nikat vikaas kaa kshetra banaate he
 Children's concentration, memory, etc
 work at a higher level during the game than in the school situation
 khel main bachche kii nai vikasman dakshataayen pehle ubhar kar aati hai
 In sports and plays, the child works according to his inner thoughts and is not bound by things that appear in tangible form
 yaheen se usamen amoort chintan va vichaar karne kii taiyaari hone lagati he
 It is also a preparation for writing because the word in writing is not like an object, it symbolizes its idea
 jitani umr tak khel main jatil or vistrut bhoomikaaon va bhashaa kaa prayog hota he vah bachche ke vikaas ke liye ek pramukh gatividhi bana rahata he
 This condition can work in children up to 10–11 years old
 dhire-dhire iskaa mahatv kam hone lagata he
 Teachers can make the game more prosperous by giving them enough time and resources to play, suggesting topics, resolving conflicts
 sabhi bachche khelte hai
 You will not be surprised if the children sit quietly together and do nothing
 agar koi balika akeli bhi ho tab bhi vah kuch na kuch khilne ke liye dhund hi leti he

 This causes the water to fall like fountains all around

 And tries to put it in the mouth again
 agar kisi darshak se yah poocha jaae ki uparyukt bhinn-bhinn sthitiyon main bachche kya kar rahe hai to shaayad yahi uttar milegaa ki, ‘‘ve khel rahe hai‘‘
 There is a general consensus in the audience as to which activity is a game and which is not
 parantu jab khel ko paribhaashit karne ke liye kaha jaataa he to koi bhi visheshgy khel kii kisi ek paribhaasha par sahamat nahin hote
 Despite these differences, there are certain characteristics of the game based on which it helps to identify the activities considered to be sports
 khel kii sabase pehali visheshta he ki khel aamod-pramod he
 The game is fun
 koi bhi aisa kaaryaklap jisase bacchon ko anand miltaa he, khel he
 The same activity can be a game for one and the same for another
 udhaahrantah jab bachche kaksha main sikkon ko pahchaanana sikh rahe hai to vah kaary kar rahe hai
 But when they play the game of buying and selling vegetables and by this process they learn to identify the coins themselves then this activity becomes a game
 doosraa, khel apane aap main hi aanandadaayak he
 Children get great satisfaction from playing
 jab bacchee baar-baar seedhi par chadhati he or usase kuudati he to aisa vah isliye karti he kyonki use majaa aata he
 Neither is she doing this action to show her skills, nor to earn a prize
 anand ke saath-saath aisa karte samay balika ke shaareerik or kriyaatmak kaushalon kaa anayas hi vikaas ho rahaa he jabaki yah uskaa uddeshy nahin he
 Lastly, play is an action in which the girl participates willingly and happily, that is, she is not pressured to play
 khel main uskaa yogadan sakriy hota he
 Adults often believe that children are not serious about that action when they are playing
 yah dharna bilkul galat he
 Children take their game very seriously
 agar unke khel main koi vyakti hastkshep kare yaa usamen badlaav kare, to bachche ise pasand nahin karte
 Children have different rules for their play activities
 shodhakartaaon ne yah jaanane kii koshish kii he ki bachche or vayask apana kaaphi samay khel main kyon vyateet karte hai
 There are different views about this
 kuch shodhakartaaon ke matanusaar khel or jivan kii samasyaon or vaastaviktaaon se palaayan he or dukhon ko bhulane kaa ek madhyam he
 Some people also see sports as a relaxation activity
 anya logon kaa drushtikon yah he ki khel dwaara hamaare sharir kii atirikt urja kharch hoti he
 An important view of children's play is that it prepares children to play the role of adults
 sabhi shodhakarta is baat se sahamat hai ki bachche khel dwaara bahut kuch sikhte hai or khel se vikaas ko gati milti he
 It is proved by studies that children who do not get opportunities and motivation to play, fall behind in every field of development
 anathalay or isi prakaar kii sansthaaon main rahane vaale bacchon ke avlokan dwaara kuch pramaan mili hai
 All such organizations provide food, shelter, physical care, clothing and education to children
 parantu shodh se yah pataa chalata he ki adhiktar maamalon main yah sansthaayen anukultam vikaas ke liye uchit vaataavaran pradaan nahin kar paati
 Often a single caretaker takes care of a lot of children and for this reason cannot give enough time to every child
 vahaan na to shishuon se koi atirikt baat karata he, na unhen dularta he or na hi koi unase kheltaa he
 On such occasions there is minimal interaction
 aisi sthiti main paalankarta or balika main paraspar sneh kaa abhaav rahata he or balika apane aap ko bhavatmak rup se surakshit mahasoos nahin kar paati
 In many such institutions it was also seen that the babies who were lying in the cradles were covered with cloth around them, due to which the infants could not see anything outside the crib
 bacchon ke paas paalane se latake khilaunon ke atirikt koi khilone nahin the or yah khilone bhi itani dur latake hue the ki bachche in tak pahunch nahin pate the
 All the days of the children were spent in the cradle and they did not get to see, hear or touch anything new
 avlokan main yah paaya gaya ki in bacchon kii sangyanatmak, bhashaa sambandhi or shaareerik vikaas kii gati anya bacchon kii tulana main dhimi thi
 Children are inquisitive in nature
 khelte hue bacchon ko vastuen chune, unhen dhyaan se dekhne or aasapaas ke vaataavaran kii chaanbin karne kaa mauka miltaa he or isse unhen apane man main uthte hue anek prashnon ke uttar milte hai
 Through sports activities, they also begin to understand the occurrence of common events
 bacchon ko icchaanusaar khilne ke avasar dene se ham unki seekhney main madad karte hai
 The game gives children the opportunity to explore and learn by themselves
 khoj kaa arth he ghatnaon or vastuon ke bare main swayan pataa lagaana
 Let us understand this fact by taking the example of Radha
 nimnlikhit ghatana yah darshaati he ki kis prakaar chaar varshiya radha ne khel hi khel main mitti ke bartan kii visheshtaon ke bare main janaa
 Radha was playing on a ladder standing on the wall
 khelte hue usne paas padaa ek mitti kaa bartan dekha or usase khilne lagi
 Radha filled the soil in it and then emptied it
 kuch samay baad usne bartan ko seedhi ke aakhri kadam par rakhane kii koshish kii
 The vessel fell down and broke
 usne toote hue tukdon kii ore thodi der tak dekha
 Then he picked up a piece and put it on the ladder again
 vah tukdaa bhi gir gaya or uske kai chote-chote tukade ho gaye
 Radha re-experimented on one of these small pieces
 is baar jab tukdaa gira to tutaa nahin
 Radha picked up this piece, looked at it carefully and then threw it and went inside the house
 radha ne kai baar tukade ko santulit karne kii koshish kii or use girte hue dekha-isse yah spasht hota he ki uski jigyaasa jaagrit ho gai thi
 Perhaps the question may have arisen in his mind, "" Will that piece also fall? "" If it falls will it also break? "and so he tried to keep that piece steady on the ladder again and again
 jab teesri baar tukdaa nahin tutaa tab vah utani hi utsuk thi
 Perhaps in her own way she understood that a very small piece does not break, but surely she would be eager to know it
 sambhav he vah kisi se puche ki har baar tukade neeche kyon gire or tut gaye or aakhri tukdaa kyon nahin tutaa? yah to nishchit he ki khelon ke dauraan use aise hi kai anubhav honge jo use yah samajhane main sahaayak honge ki vastuon ke girane par kya hota he
 It is true that if that small piece is thrown hard, it will also break and maybe an older child would try it
 parantu radha main abhi is baat ko samajhane kii kshamta nahin he or is kaaran usne vah tukdaa jor se nahin phenkaa
 This makes it clear that the girl learns what she is knowledgeably prepared for
 jaisaa ki yah baat is tathy se bhi sambandhit he ki balika ko jo prerak lagata he vah uske gyanatmak kaushalon par nirbhar karata he
 How the game helps development, now consider the second issue
 khel main balika ko apni ruchi ke anusaar kriyaayein chunane kii swatantraaa hoti he is kaaran vah aise khel chunati he jo uske liye na to bahut saral hon na hi bahut kathin parantu chunauteepurn hon
 Thus she learns the things she is prepared to learn
 is prakaar seekhney kii prakriya boj na banakar aanandadaayak ho jaati he
 At the same time, children learn through activity in play
 aisa karne se sankalpanaaon ko adhik acchhee tarah samajha ja saktaa he
 If children are told about a concept only verbally and are not given the opportunity to do it themselves, then they will not understand it so well
 yah baat aapane swayan anubhav bhi kii hogi
 For example, the method of making a dish from the mouth of a friend cannot be learned as much as by making the dish yourself
 usee prakaar agar aapane radha ko keval bataaya hi hota ki mitti se bana ek chota sa tukdaa girane par nahin tuutegaa to yah lagbhag nishchit he ki radha ko yah baat samaj nahin aati or vah is jaankaree main ruchi bhi nahin leti The fact that 'children learn by doing something' does not mean that the follower has no role in it
 sabase pehle paalankarta kii aavashyaktaa isliye he ki vah bacchon ko unki khoj samajhane main madad kar sake
 Perhaps Radha has understood that small pieces do not break, but we cannot say for sure
 yah to he hi ki aise anya avasar milane par vah yah baat samaj jaaegi
 But the follower can help him learn this
 udhaahrantah agar paalankarta radha ke saath hoti to vah radha kaa dhyaan un sambhaavnaaon kii ore kendrit kar sakati thi jiske bare main radha ne sochaa nahin tha
 She could have said, "radha, did you see that the utensil broke but small pieces were not broken?" dwitiya paalankarta bachche kii khoj ko vistrut kar sakati he
 She could have asked Radha to do new experiments like, "radha, now throw this small piece on a soft surface like grass, sand or water and see what happens
" ‘‘ isse yah prayog anya khoj kaa kaaran banataa, jaise ghaas main mitti kaa tukdaa nahin tuutata ityadi
 Along with this, the follower should provide opportunities for children to explore
 bachche nayaa sikhte hai jab unhen khel saamagree se khilne diya jaataa he or swayan kuch karne ke liye protsaahit kiya jaae
 Finally, the follower should not always wait for the children to do anything themselves
 use bacchon ke liye aisi paristhitiyon kaa aayojan karnaa chahie jinke dwaara bachche nayaa sikh saken
 When the follower is doing this, he should also take into consideration the children's interest and level of cognitive development
 udhaahrantah pani se khele jane vaale khelon ko lijie
 Give children a vessel filled with water and some different kinds of things - some of which will float in water and some are drowning
 jab bachche in chizon ko pani main daalenge to ve dekhenge ki kuch jaise-pattey, tahaniyaan or kaagaj ke tukade to pani ke upar tairte hai jabaki chammach, pathar aadi pani main dub jate hai
 After that you can discuss the topic with the children as to why some things sink and some float
 is prakaar paalankarta bacchon ko khel ke madhyam se rang, aakaar, ank, mausam, vibhinn prakaar kii chidiyon or paudhon ityadi ke bare main jaanane main madad kar sakati he
 Children are also familiar with concepts such as short, long and thin, light and heavy by sports
 jis prakaar gyanatmak vikaas ke liye paalankarta ko kriyalap yojit karnaa he usee prakaar anya kshetron main vikaas protsaahit karne ke liye bhi paalankarta ko vikaas anusaar kriyalap yojit karne chahie
 Children play different roles through imagination in the game
 aisa karte hue unki buddhi or vyavhaar usee vyakti ke anusaar hota he jinaki vah bhoomika kar rahe hai
 For this reason, they also display the thoughts and feelings of those individuals
 udhaahrantah khel balika gidya kii maan banakar gudiya ko kahati he ki use toffee nahin milegi kyonki uske liye hanikaarak he
 Perhaps she said this because when the girl saw - 'imitating the mother in the game is learning proper behavior
 naatak karnaa bacchon ke khel kaa ek abhinn hissaa he
 In the game, the girl is cut off from reality and creates many more
 ek tuuti plate teen varshiya balika ke liye teble ban jaati he or ek das varshiya balak ke liye antariksh yaan
 The row of matchboxes becomes a train, and while playing on this train, the children pretend to cross the river passing through the jungle and fight the dacoits
 aap yah dekhakar hairaan ho jaaenge ki rail patari par na chal sadak par hi chal rahi he
 It is not necessary that the game should be realistic
 khel kalpana shakti ko viksit karata he or yah bacchon ko dainik sthitiyon se jujhane main madad karata he
 Development of physical and functional skills depends on practice
 khel aisi kriya he jo bacchon ko abhyaas ke paryaapt avasar pradaan karti he
 The following incident makes it clear- ek maan jab chaar maheene ke shishu ke aage ek jhunjhuna rakh detii he
 Baby's attention is drawn towards tingling
 or vah apni peeth se pet par palat kar us tak pahunchne kii koshish karata he
 To do this, muscle coordination is necessary
 baar-baar jhunjhune tak pahunchne ke prayaas main shishu ko mitti khaane kaa avasar miltaa he or dhire-dhire vah aasaani se kar letaa he
 Children develop a lot of muscle coordination when they try to walk on a row of bricks, climb a wall, climb a ladder, hang in swings, play running games, ride a bicycle
 khel-khel main jameen main gadde khodne, phulon ke haar banane, chitra banane or unamem rang bharne main bacchon kii laghu mansapeshiyon kaa vikaas hota he
 How do children learn to play? It is clear that to know the language, it is necessary for them to be able to hear and speak the language
 paalankarta ke saath vinodshil kriyaaon main bacchee ko bhashaa sunne ke bahut avasar milte hai jo use bolne ke liye prerit karte hai
 When the girl is about nine months old, she makes many voices like "ga ga ga", "bay bay bay", "ma ma ma", "mam mam"
 inamen se kuch vayaskon kii bhashaa kii shuruuaat hai
 During this interaction, the girl learns to speak between different sounds
 yah kshamta use baad main ‘‘abba‘‘ or ‘‘ammaa‘‘ jaise shabdon main bhed karne madad karti he or vah unhen alag-alag shabdon ke rup main pahchaan paati he
 Children also begin to understand various shapes such as square, round, straight and curved lines which later help them to identify different letters
 khelte hue bachche yah dekhte hai ki kaala or laal vrutt yaa chota or bada vrutt sabhi golakaar hai
 This will help them understand that the letter 'A' remains 'A' whether it is at the beginning or the end of the word
 khel main vah pehle or baad, baayein or daayen, upar or neeche jaisi sankalpanaaon kaa arth sikhti he jo ki likhnaa or padhanaa seekhney ke liye ati aavashyak hai
 You have noticed that games are helpful in functional development which is necessary for learning to write
 bachche sahajata se vahi sikhte hai jinamein unki ruchi hoti he
 This is also true for learning to write and read
 kahaniyaan sunne se bacchon main swayan unhen padhane ke liye ichha jaagrit hogi or vah padhane or likhane ke liye prerit honge
 If the girl does not know how to write and the follower pressures her to write, then possibly the process of learning to write should be made into a game in which the girl puts small stones on the 'A' written on the ground, walks on the outline or ' If 'A' is written by adding the letters of the letter 'A', then it will gradually become familiar with the outline of 'A'
 is prakaar use mazaa bhi aayega or vah bina dabaav ke likhnaa sikh jaaegi
 When the mother bathes, dresses, sleeps, and takes care of all her other needs, the girl begins to recognize the mother during these interactions
 uskaa maan se lagaav bhi badhata he
 You know that this is the first social relationship of the baby, which also has a profound effect on her future relationships
 jivan ke praarambhik varshaan main bacchee apane haathon pairon se tathaa aasapaas kii vastuon se khelti he
 This lets the baby know that his body is different from the surrounding objects
 aisa anubhavon ke dwaara uski apane bare main dharna viksit hoti he
 During the game, the girl understands what impact people and objects can have
 vah yah samajhane lagati he ki rone par maan uske paas aegi, jab vah hansegi to maan bhi hansegi or use god main uthaa legi
 He turns away from her as she pushes the cans
 isse bachche ko pataa chalata he ki kis tarah uski gatividhiyaan vaataavaran par asar daalati he
 Knowing the surroundings and battling with various situations increases the confidence of the girl child and makes her feel self-reliant
 jaise-jaise balika badi hoti he vah anya bacchon ke saath khelti he
 Playing with them learns to share things, follow rules, wait for their turn
 is prakaar vah anya logon ke drushtikon ko dhyaan main rakhana or unako mahatv dena bhi sikhti he
 Children often imitate adults while playing
 is prakaar se upyukt vyavhaar or un bhoomikaaon ko sikhte hai jo ki unhen bade hokar nibhaani hongi
 They get information about different kinds of functions, festivals, perceptions in playing interaction
 khel kriyaayein bacchon ko harsh ullas, krodh, bhay or dukh vyakt karne kaa avasar pradaan karti hai
 In the game, you have the freedom to do anything you want, provided it does not harm anyone
 khel un bhaawanaaon or sanvegon ko vyakt karne kaa mauka detaa he jo anya sthitiyon main abhivyakt nahin kiye ja sakate
 For example, while playing the role of the father in the game, the girl can ask the other child to follow his orders
 aisa vah anya sthitiyon main shaayad na kar sake
 She can shout loudly while playing a fight scene, banging things around which she is not usually allowed
 chaar varshiya raja ko akasar apane mata-pita se maamuli sa niyam todane par bhi daant padati thi
 He had to slap his father for even the smallest mistake
 pita use qamar kii peti se peetate the
 This child often imagines sitting in a chair and thinking that the chair is a horse and beating the chair with a thong, says "move fast, even faster"
 isse spasht he ki bachche kaa man apane pita ke prati gusse or kudhan se bharaa hua he parantu in bhaawanaaon ko vah yatharth rup main apane pita ke prati vyakt nahin kar saktaa
 This imaginary play-off gives him a chance to express his anger and feelings
 is tarah khel dwaara avyakt bhavanaayen ubhar kar saamne aati hai
 In the above examples you saw that their emotions and moods are clearly reflected in the children's play
 isiilie khel un bacchon ke liye upachaar yaa chikitsa he jo paristhiti ke anusaar saamaanya bhaavnaatmak pratikriya nahin darshaate
 Games help children in development and prepare them for future roles
 khel-khel main sikhi gai sankalpanaayen padhane-likhane ke kaushal or samooh khel main hissaa lene kii kshamta tathaa baad main skool main samaayojan main madad karte hai
 Therefore, sports formality helps in the preparation of education
 khel prashn poochne or khojbin karne kii manovriti ko bhi pariposhit karata he
 As children learn new things and become proficient in them, they become confident about themselves
 yah badhata hua aatm-vishwaas unhen chunautiyaan sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar karata he
 Children's play actions can be classified in many ways
 kuch vargeekaran khel ke sthaan kaa dhyaan main rakhte hue kiye jate hai, kuch khel kriyaaon kii vishaywastu par aadhaarit hote hai or anya khel kriyaaon par
 Different classifications have been made for the convenience of these verbs
 vastutah sabhi vargeekaran kuch ansh tak paraspar sambhddha hai
 Followers conduct several sports activities keeping goals and objectives in mind
 in kriyaaon main bachche ko paalankarta ke anudeshon kaa paalan karnaa padataa he
 He does not have much freedom to change the game
 apane dhang se khilne ke liye balika swatantra he yaa use paalankarta dwaara bataae gaye niyamon kaa paalan karnaa padataa he-is aadhaar par khel ko mukt or sanrachanaatmak khelon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 For example, when the girl is playing with clay without any adult intervention / direction then it is called free play
 duusari ore akruti kii sankalpana samajhane ke liye balika ko jab paalankarta nirdesh detii he jaise ‘‘chalo baahar chalakar mitti ke katore or thali banaaen‘‘ tab khel sanrachit kehalaata he
 This discussion does not mean that children do not learn from free play
 sabhi prakaar ke khelon se bacchon ko seekhney main badhaava miltaa he
 The only difference is that the achievement expected from the structured game is already determined by the follower
 donon prakaar ke khel bacchon ke liye anivaary hai
 Free play maintains curiosity and initiative
 or bacchon ko khoj karne ke liye protsaahit karata he
 In structural play, the follower may attract the attention of the girl to certain aspects which she may not have thought of
 is prakaar sanrachanaatmak khel vishesh lakshya kii prapti main madad karata he
 It is necessary for the follower to keep in mind that children should enjoy both types of sports activities
 jaisaa ki naam se spasht he, khule maidan main khele jane vaale khel bahari khel va ghar main khele jane vaale khel, bhitari khel kehalaate hai
 There are opportunities for activities in outdoor games because there are more places and less barriers
 ghar ke andar khele jane vaale khelon ke liye sthaan simit hota he or gatividhiyon kii swatantraaa apekshaakrit kam hoti he
 As such, the difference between outdoor and indoor sports is very less
 kai bhitari khel baahar khele ja sakate hai, or bahari khel bhi thode se parivartan ke saath andar khele ja sakate hai
 Sometimes by removing the inner game activity, the dullness is removed and the same action becomes new and interesting for the child
 jab balika swayan akele khelti he to yah vaiyaktik khel kehalaata he
 When she plays with two or more children, it is called collective play
 samooh main khilne ke liye aavashyak he ki bacchee dusron ke drushtikon ko dhyaan main rakhe or khel ke niyamon kaa paalan kare
 As you have read these qualifications develop with age
 teen-chaar saal kii umr tak bachche adhiktar akele hi khelte hai
 With other children they only play together for a short time
 jaise-jaise bachche bade hote hai ve dusron ke saath khelnaa sikhte hen or phir unke khilne kaa adhikansh samay samooh main khilne main bitta he
 But from time to time, older children also like to play alone
 jahaan samooh main khilne se saamaajik kaushal badhate hai vahiin vaiyaktik khel bacchon ko un vastuon se khilne kaa samay detaa he jo unhen sabase ruchikar lagati he
 Both games are helpful in the development of his skills
 kai baar vayask jhujhanlakar kah uthte hai, ‘‘bachche ek sthaan par kyon nahin baith sakate? kyon idhar-udhar bhaagate rahete hai?‘‘ bachche bhaagane, kudane or uchhalane vaale khel khelnaa pasand karte hai arthath vah khel jisamen adhik urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Such sports activities are called active / active game activities
 ve khel jinamein adhik shaareerik kriya kii aavashyaktaa na ho jaise jameen par chock se likhnaa, chitra bananaa, mitti se khilone bananaa or pattharon se minar bananaa, bacchon ko aaraam detii hai
 Games that do not spend much energy are called quiet games
 shaishavkaal main bacchon kaa khel he vastuon ko choona, soonghanaa, chakhnaa or parivesh kii chaanbin karnaa
 These activities engage the senses and require muscle coordination
 isliye inhen samvedi-kriyaatmak khel kaha jaataa he
 By the end of infancy, children begin to participate in dramatic play
 is tarah ke khel main bachche kalpana karte hai ki tin kaa dibba ghar he yaa lakdi kaa gutka hawaii jahaaj
 Thus an object is used away from its actual form
 bachche anya logon kii bhoomika nibhaate hue kabhi falwaala, kabhi shikshak to kabhi phuulavaali hone kaa dhong karte hai
 Thus the game requires a cognitive ability to use objects and people as symbolic
 aise khel pratikatmak khel kehalaate hai or ye shalapurv varshon main maansik vikaas ke parinamswaroop hi sambhav he
 Moving from sensory-functional games to symbolic games are based on increasing complexity in children's thinking
 khel kaa yah vargeekaran paraspar sambhddha he
 Free games can be played in the open or inside
 samuhik khel sakriy yaa shant ho saktaa he
 Importance should be given that the child gets a chance to play every type of game because every sport has its own importance
 bachche kis prakaar khel khelte hai, kisi khel saamagree kaa upyog karte hai, unke khel kii vishaywastu kya he or ve kitna samay khel main vyateet karte hai, ye sab kai karkon se prabhavit hote hai
 The type of sports that children choose is influenced by their age
 ek chah maheene ke shishu ke liye apane aasapaas padi vastuon ko uthaanaa or unka nirikshan karnaa hi khel he
 a four-year-old child finds cycling tricycles and making objects out of sand
 ek aath varshiya balak dopahiyaa cycle chalaanaa, pedo par chadhana or stapu khelnaa pasand karata he
 The choice of sports activity by children is also determined by their skills and abilities
 upar likhit udaahranon main jo khel chaar or aath varshiya baalkon ne chune ve unke shaareerik kaushalon se prabhavit the
 As children get older their social abilities also increase
 jisase unki paraspar antah kriya main gunatmak badlaav aata he or is kaaran unke khel ke prakaar bhi prabhavit hote hai
 Games that require mutual support, playing in the team and following the rules are beyond the ability of three-year-old boys, but it is possible for eight-year-old boys to play like this
 bacchon ke khel kii vishaywastu bhi umr ke saath-saath badalati he
 The six-year-old girl and the three-year-old girl will have differences in playing with the doll
 chah varshiya balika vistrut rup se khel kaa aayojan karti he- vah gudiya ko skool ke liye taiyaar karti he, use padhaati he, uski pragati ke bare main mata-pita se charchaa karti he or use khilne ke liye baahar bhi le jaati he, ityadi
 a three-year-old girl playing dolls would be much simpler than this
 ek vishesh khel kriya main balika kitna samay vyateet karti he, yah uski umr se nirdhaarit hota he
 As you know, the younger the girl, the shorter the duration she will be able to concentrate in a sports activity
 isi kaaran uski kriyaaon main baar-baar badlaav honge
 Although children's age plays a definite role in influencing their play, we should not forget that individual differences and interests are also important in the game
 sambhav he ki ek paanch varshiya balika apni umr ke anya bacchon kii apeksha samuhik khel main kam samay vyateet kare
 If you observe the game of infants, you will find similarity in it
 shaishavastha main ling khel ko prabhavit nahin karata
 His game is related to the exploration of objects in and around him
 par jaise-jaise bachche bade hote hai to ladakon or ladakiyon kii ruchiyaan bhinn hone lagati hai
 These differences increase with age
 ladkiyaan apni maan ke kapade pahananaa, gudiya se khelnaa, khaanaa banane kaa naatak karnaa, silaai karnaa or stapu khelnaa pasand karti hai
 Boys like to wear their father's clothes, pretend to read newspapers, sit on a chair, drive bullock carts, plow fields and play with guns
 Many studies have compared boys and girls to sports
 unase pataa chalata he ki ladakiyon kii apeksha ladakon ke khelon main marpet, uthapatak adhik hoti he or ve ladakiyon kii apeksha adhik pratiyogi bhaavana ke hote hai
 Girls show more support in sports than boys
 ladke ojasvi khel adhik khelte hai
 What can be the reason? ek kaaran ladakon or ladakiyon main shaareerik bhinnata ho sakati he
 How much physical activity a child can perform is affected by his body instinct
 isi kaa asar bacchon ke khel chayan par padataa he or isi kaaran ladke adhik sakriy khel chunate hai
 But the reason for most of the sports interests of children is not social instinct but social expectations and stereotypes
 bacchon se logon kii apekshaayen unke ling dwaara prabhavit hoti hai
 This affects their game selection
 aaie, ise ek udhaaharan se samajhen
 You have often noticed that a boy climbs a tree more easily than a girl
 aisa nahin he ki ladki main ped par chadh sakane kaa samarthy nahin he
 But it is possible that when the girl started climbing the tree for the first time, her mother said to her, "what boys are doing, get down
 ‘‘ duusari ore ladke kii isi prayaas ke liye avashya shaabaashi di gai hogi atah ladkaa, ladki kii apeksha adhik kushalta se ped par chadhana sikh jaataa he
 In daily chores at home, girls are expected to look after younger siblings and help with household chores
 isliye unke khelon main bhi yahi sthitiyaan jhalkati hai
 The boys help the father, work outside, and such situations are reflected in his game
 aajkal visheshkar shaharon main, ladakiyon ko khel main doctor or police kii bhoomika main dekha ja saktaa he kyonki mahilaayein ab in vyavsaayon ko apnaane lagi hai
 Parents also encourage the interests of boys and girls by giving different sports equipment, the girls are given doll utensils and other similar toys
 ladakon ko bandook or kaaron jaise khilone dilwaaye jate hai
 Four-year-old Hari was categorically refused when her sister called her to play with the doll, saying, "I don't play girls' games
" ‘‘ parantu jab vah sochataa he ki koi use nahin dekh rahaa, tab vah gudiyon se kheltaa he
 It is clear that Hari enjoys playing with dolls
 gudiyon ke khel ke prati uski pratyaksh aruchi janmajaat nahin he
 Culture affects lifestyles
 shishupaalan kii paramparaayen bhi samskruti se prabhavit hoti hai
 We will discuss some of these traditions here
 aaie, ab ham is prakaar kii kuch paramparaon ke bare main padhein
 Massaging babies with oil is an old practice in many parts of our country
 maan aamtaur par gaanaa gunagunaati he, bachche ke saath baat karti he or khelti he
 There are many such mother and baby games in all parts of India
 shishu kaa yah anubhav ek anya samskruti, jahaan aisi antah kriyaayein nahin hotin, main rahane vaale shishu kii tulana main bahut bhinn hoga
 Children's imagination of adult life is reflected in their play
 vayask hone par ve jo bananaa chahta he un bhoomikaaon kii jhalak akasar unke khel main milti he or ye bhoomikaaye samskruti dwaara nirdhaarit hoti hai
 The game also showcases the traditional festivals and customs of their society
 sabhi samskritiyon main khilaunon kii samrudh parampara hoti he
 When ancient civilizations like the Indus Valley were excavated, toys were also found there
 adhyayanon se yah pataa chalata he ki hamaare desh main bhinn-bhinn pradeshon kii khel saamagree main paraspar vibhinnata he
 Orissa's beautiful masks and puppets are famous
 lakdi ke khilone karnataka ke chennapatna or andhra pradesh ke konda palli main banate hai tamilnadu or maharashta main lok parampara ke khilaunon ke saath-saath aadhunik khilone bhi banate hai
 On the other hand, commercial toys are rarely found in Manipur and Tripura
 yahan ke nivasee ghar par hi apane bacchon ke liye khilone banaate hai
 In most parts of our country, many folk toys are found in markets during festivals
 in khilaunon kaa vyavsaayik rup se banaae gaye khilaunon ke samaan shaikshik mahatv hota he
 Most of the children's time in lower social classes is spent helping parents work
 kaaryon main vyast rahane ke kaaran khilne ke liye unhen bahut kam samay mil paata he
 During his work, he makes time to play
 madhyam or ucch saamaajik varg ke bachche ke paas khel ke liye adhik samay hota he kyonki aay utpaadak gatividhiyon main unka yogadan anivaary nahin hota
 But in some families of these classes, parents place great emphasis on education and due to this they reduce the playing time of the children
 bacchon ko pathar, botalon ke dhakkan, khaali dibbe aadi jamaa karnaa acha lagata he
 It is not surprising to find such a collection if you empty a child's pocket
 kai baar bachche ghar ke ek kone main apane ikattha kiye pathar, sepiyan or pasand kii anya vastuen rakh lete hai
 Costly, adorned dolls and CP collected from the beach - each child, whether rich or poor, attracts equally those children who belong to families with good financial status, toys found in the market Can buy jab bane banaaye khilone kharidne kaa samarthy parivaar main na ho to puraane tair, pahiye, khaali dibbe, maachis ke dibbe, puraane akhbaar khilne ke liye upyog main laaye jate hai
 Children need to be more creative in such a situation so that they can make the game material themselves
 saamaajik varg se yah bhi nirdhaarit hota he ki bacchon ko khilne ke liye kitni or kisi jagah milegi
 Children who live in large houses, where there are gardens, they can use the place to play
 jo bachche ek kamare vaale makaanon main rahete hai unhen galiyon or sadakon par apane khilne kaa sthaan dhu dha naa padataa he
 You had read that all the large members of the lower class family engage in income producing activities
 mata-pita ke paas bacchon ke khel main hissaa lene or unka maargdarshan karne ke liye bahut kam samay hota he
 Middle and upper class parents are likely to spend more time with children
 aamtaur par ve adhik shikshit hote hai or sambhav he ki bacchon ke vikaas main khel ke mahatv ke bare main adhik jaanate hon atah ve bacchon ko khilne ke liye paryaapt avasar denge
 But it is not necessary that education should create an attitude that is sensitive to the needs of children
 ashikshit abhibhavak bhi bacchon kii aavashyaktaaon ke prati samvedansheel ho sakate hai or unhen khel ke kai vividh anubhav de sakate hai
 There is hardly any open space to play in the crowded city
 phir bhi bachche khilne ke liye jagah dhund hi lete hai
 You may have seen them playing in the narrow streets, on the streets and on the roofs of the house
 shaharon main paudhon ko dekhne kaa avasar kam hi miltaa he gramin or jan- kshetra main khilne ke liye khuli jagah adhik milti he or bachche prakruti ke adhik sameep hote hai
 Printed mass media, such as magazines and books, and audio-visual media, such as radio and television, have a tremendous impact on children's play
 bacchon ke liye anek chitrit kitaaben or patrikas uplabdh hai or unke liye vishesh rup se radio or televijan par vibhinn kaarykram bhi prasaarit hote hai
 Children eagerly act out the stories they read, sing tunes heard on the radio and enthusiastically mimic the characters watching the television program
 jansampark madhyam akasar samaaj kii roodhibaddh dharanaon kaa samarthan karte hai or ye dharanaayen bacchon ke khel main jhalkati hai
 Public relations media bring the world closer to children and if they get information under the direction of an adult, it can be very beneficial
 mudrit or shravy-drishy madhyam jis prakaar kii prerana bacchon ko pradaan karte hai usamen bhinnata hoti he
 Books are a medium that can be explored only by reading themselves
 is prakaar kii seekhney kii prakriya main bacchon kii sakriy bhoomika hoti he or yah khojbin kii bhaavana va jigyaasa ko badhaava detii he
 On the other hand, children mostly listen to and watch television and radio programs
 aamtaur par ye kaarykram unhen khoj kaa mauka na dekar keval bataate hai ki kya jaananaa chahie
 For this reason, the direction of adults in audio-visual medium becomes mandatory
 parivaar or pados main bacchon ko jo anubhav hote hai, ve mahatvapurn dhang se khel ke str ko prabhavit karte hai
 The following two examples illustrate this
 ek nimna saamaajik varg ke parivaar main mata-pita subah hi kaam ke liye nikal jate hai or shaam ko ghar waapas aate hai
 The mother massages the baby before going to work and then plays and talks to him
 shaam ko jab mata-pita donon waapas aa jate hai tab pita bacchee ke saath khelte hai or maan ghar kaa kaam-kaaj karti he
 In the second case, an educated mother, who belongs to a rich family, keeps her baby girl in her crib mostly near toys
 bacchee kii keval shaareerik dekhbhaal kii ore uskaa dhyaan hota he or vah usase bahut kam khelti he
 In these two situations it is possible that the girl child of the first family will have a better childhood because she gets many opportunities to learn and feels safe
 jo abhibhavak or paalankarta khel kaa mahatv samajhate hai, ve bacchon ko aisa-vaataavaran de sakate hai jisamen khel ko badhaava mili chaahe unka saamaajik varg, shiksha str yaa paristhiti kisi bhi kyon na ho
 The common belief about the game is that it is the opposite of work
 khel ek aisi sthiti he jisamen log koi upyogi yaa vishisht kaam nahin kar rahe hote hai
 There is also a thinking about the game that it is enjoyable, free and effortless
 yah drushtikon chote bachche ke vikaas main khel ke mahatv ko nakaarta he
 Over the years, many psychological theorists have begun to emphasize the importance of sports in the development of a child
 inhone khel ke anek pakshon par bal diya he or bataaya he ki khel kaise manovaigyanik prakriyaaon ko prabhavit karata he
 According to Erickson and Anna Freud, the game is a replacement for unfulfilled desires and a way of liberation and revival from the deadly events of the past
 manovishleshnatmak paddati khel ke saamaajik samvegatmak pakshon par bal detii he
 Through the game, the child resolves his mental conflicts with the parents and, irrational, fears
 ek bacchee rakshas-rakshas khel kar andhere ke bhay par kaabo paati he, ek baccha apni gudiya ko kisi niyam ke kalpit ulanghan ke liye usee tarah sajaa detaa he jaise ek mata-pita usko sajaa dete hai
 In Erickson's view, sports are a way of discovery, initiative and freedom for a child during the preschool phase
 manovaigyanik drushti se khel virechak anubhav main madhyam se aakraamakata ko disha dene kaa ek tarika he
 It is also a response to the past and a mechanism for returning to the events of the past
 partail or anya siddhantkaar khel ko saamaajik aadan-pradaan ke ek rup kii tarah dekhte hai jo sahpaathiyon ke saath sahyogi karyaan main sanlagn hone kii bachche kii viksit hoti hui kshamta ko uttam bhi banaata he or pratibimbit bhi karata he
 In the early stages of the game, exchanges with classmates occur almost or little and there is also an inability to use social skills at that time
 aage chalakar duusare ke paksh se dekhne kii kshamta, vibhinn bhoomikaaon main samanvay, khel kii vishaywastu ke bare main baatcheet or jhagadon ko sulajhane kii samarthy kaa vikaas hota hua dikhaai detaa he
 Fictitious and dramatic situations in play are generally considered to be more mature methods of social exchange
 kuch shodhakartaaon ne dhakka-mukki vaale khelon ko bhi saamaajik drushtikon se dekha he
 All types of wrestling and 'catch to go' category of sports can be included under the push
 saamaajik khelon kii tarah dhakka-mukki ke khelon main bhi bhoomikaayen hoti hai
 According to Piaget, play plays a big role in the child's developing mental abilities
 piyaaje khel ke vikaas ke kai charan ginate hai
 The first phase, which they call practice or functional play, is a symptom of a period of sensation-induced action
 kaaryaatmak khel main baccha vastuon ke istemaal kii parichit paddatiyon ko doharaata he
 For example, drinks from an empty cup, pretending to comb hair using hands
 doosraa charan, pratikatmak khel he jiskaa ubhaar kriyapurv / parichalanpurv daur main hota he
 This is a period of use of mental symbols
 vastuen apane se alag kisi vastu kaa pratik hoti hai
 In a symbolic game, a wooden block can be made into a telephone, boat, boat, banana or airplane
 piyaaje ne sanrachanaatmak or naatakeey khel main antar kiya he
 Structural games use concrete objects to create or create other objects
 udhaaharan ke liye car or tank vaale khilone ke liye, ek shahar banane main lakdi ke blokon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In dramatic play, children create imagined positions and roles through words and postures
 ve bhoomikaayen rachate or tay karte hai ki koun sa baccha kis bhoomika ko nibhaayega or ek kalpit drishy ke liye vishaywastu or uske vikaas kii disha kii sujh lete hai
 The emergence of dramatic play often surfaces somewhat outside of the structural game
 piyaaje ne is daur ke kalpit swabhaav ke khel ko bachche ke aatm kendrit vichaar ke pratibimb ke rup main dekha
 According to Piaget, it ends at the beginning of the concrete-functional phase around the age of seven
 antim charan main khel niyambaddh krida ko game main badalane kii baat kahi gayi he
 Here the same distinction is being made between 'sports' and 'sports' in Hindi
 krida niyambaddh evam sanrachit khel hai, main badal jaataa he jo thos kriyaatmak daur main apni bulandi par pahunchataa he
 The specialty of this period is that direct rules are used externally to initiate, control and continue and end social exchanges
 anek samakaleen shodhakartaaon ne piyaaje kii dharanaon ko vistaar diya he
 Smalenski and Shephatya have confirmed that the direct correlation of game development links with the development of language, problem-solving and rational mathematical thinking
 kintu smallenski or shefatya piyaaje kii is avadharana se sahamat nahin hai
 The game is the result of a smooth progression from a sensory action phase to a pre-functional and concrete action phase
 unka vichaar he ki khel kaa vikaas saamaajik sandarbh or bado ke pathpradarshan par nirbhar he
 He also believes that sports training is mandatory for some children
 inhone apane shodh se sabit kiya he ki bacchon ke khel ke str ko vayask safaltaapurvak badha sakate hai
 The increased level of play also has a positive effect on other cognitive skills of the child
 vaigotski kaa vishwaas tha ki khel sangyanatmak, bhavatmak or saamaajik vikaas ko badhaava detaa he
 Unlike other theories discussed above, Vygotsky's approach to the importance of sports in development was more coordinated
 vaigotski ke liye khel bacchon ko apane vyavhaar par niyantran kii kshamta dene vaala maansik upkaran he
 The hypothetical situations that are created in the game are the first obstacles to control and guide the child's behavior in a particular way
 khel vyavhaar ko sangathit karata he
 For example, in sports, the child does not behave freely, in the game of "mummy-mummy" or "driver-driver", he pretends to be a mother or truck-driver
 har kalpit sthiti main bhoomikaayen or niyam nishchit niyam hote hai jo swaabhaavik rup se sataha par aa jate hai
 The roles are of characters played by children such as pirates or teachers
 kalpit sthiti kii vishaywastu badalane ke saath bhoomikaayen or niyam bhi badal jate hai
 For example, the rules of the 'grocery store', the rules of the game, will vary from the roles of children playing 'lion-lion' and the rules of the game
 khel ke niyam aarambh main khel ke bheetar prachhann hote hai, aage chal kar ve sataha par aa jate hai or bacchon ke bich tay kiye jate hai
 Therefore, the game consists of an explicit imaginary situation and some hidden rules
 kalpit sthiti bacchon dwaara rachit vah sthiti he jiske sach hone kaa bahaanaa kiya jaataa he
 Despite being fanciful, it becomes apparent to others as children manifest its symptoms
 ve kehete hai, ‘maan lo ki yahaan ek kursi or vahaan ek mez he
 Suppose we have six children in our class and we are teachers
 ’ ishaaron or awaajon se bhi ve apane khel kii kalpit sthiti ko prakat kiya karte hai
 Such as the sound of "chi xxrep 8 r ghu xxrep 6 r " to reveal a tank emanating from a petonl-pump-station, or the "chinhinhinhinh" noise of a child pulling a fan of a fictitious horse
 " lekin niyam prachhann maane jate hai kyonki unako aasaani se dekha nahin ja saktaa, vyavhaar ke dwaara keval unka anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Rules are expressed as a sample of behavior associated with a particular role
 In the hypothetical state of play every role imposes its own rules on the child's behavior
 pashchimi pariprekshya se dekhen to khel ke vishay main yah vichaar asaadhaaran hai kyonki paramparaagat rup se ham khel ko sarvatha svachhnd or nirbaadh samajhate aae hai
 But Vygotsky says that children in sports do not behave only arbitrarily
 ‘mummy-mummy ke khel main or ‘teacher-teacher’ ke khel main bachche antar karte hai
 Different postures, different costumes, even the language varies according to each role
 khel ke aarambhik charnon main ve in antaron se avgat nahin hote, lekin chaar varsh kii umr ke adhikansh bachche dikhaa dete hai ki ve kisi bhoomika ke nirvaah main hone vaali galatiyon ke prati atyant samvedansheel hote hai or aksar ek duusare ko sudhaarte bhi hai, mummy brifces lekar chalati hai, ’‘tum teacher ho to bacchon ko baithna padegaa,’’ ‘‘teacher kitaab ko aise padhati hai’’ ityadi
 Children also violate role rules like a joke
 teen varsh kaa tobi oonchi kursi par chadhakar kahata he, ‘‘ab main daddy hum
 "he then laughs and laughs and says," Daddy can no longer sit in his high chair
 " As summarized by recent research in the West, Smalenski and Shephatya point out that dramatic play development benefits cognitive and social development as well as school related skills
 udhaaharan ke liye shabdic abhivyakti, shabd-bhandar, samaj, avdhaan kii avadhi, kalpanashiltaa, ekaagratha, aavesh par niyantran, jigyaasa, samasya-samaadhaan kii or adhik yuktiyaan, sahyog, sahanubhuti or samuhik bhagidaari inamen shaamil hai
 The Vygotskyists have investigated the mechanisms by which sports influence development
 udhaaharan ke liye manul ke or istomina ne dekha he ki adhigam kii anya gatividhiyon kii apeksha khel ke dauraan bacchon ke maansik kaushal ucchtar str par hote hai
 Vygotsky recognizes this as a higher level of near-development area
 manul ke ne paaya ki baaki kii apeksha khel ke samay bacchon kaa aatm-niyantran ucchtar str par hota he
 When a boy was given the task of monitoring in the game, then he could not concentrate on the work given by the teacher for as long as he was concentrating on his place
 istomina ne tulana karke dekha ki prayogshaala main ek samatuly sthiti kii apeksha bachche ‘kiraane kii dukaan’ kaa khel khelte samay kitni chijen yaad rakh pate hai
 The children were given a list of words to remember
 khel kii naatakeey sthiti main, kiraane kii dukaan kaa khel khelte samay bacchon ko yah suchi di gayi or prayogshaala main pariksha kii sthiti main manul ke ne paaya ki naatakeey khel kii sthiti main bacchon ko zyada sankhya main chijen yaad raheen
 According to Vygotsky, game development affects three ways: vaigotski ke anusaar khel bachche ke liye nikat-vikaas-kshetra kaa nirmaan bhi karata he
 In sports, a child always behaves above his age and above the level of his daily behavior, as if during the game he himself has grown more than his height
 khel ke bheetar vikaas kii sari pravriÿyaan, maano aatshi shishe ke focus main, sarabhoot rup se maujuud rahati hai ; maano baccha apane saamaanya str se upar chalaang lagane ko tatpar ho
 The relation of sports and development can be compared to the relation of education and development
 khel vikaas kaa strot he or nivikshe kii rachana karata he
 The theme of the game alone does not define the immediate development area
 khilne ke liye baccha jis maansik prakriya main sanlagn hota he vah nivikshe kii rachana karti he
 Roles, rules and motivations derived from hypothetical conditions are helpful for the child to work at a higher level in the near development area
 yadi ham khel or khel ke baahar kii sthitiyon main bachche ke vyavhaaron kii tulana karenge to hamen nikat vikaas kshetra ke ucchtar tathaa nimnatar str dikhaai denge
 Outside of sports or in real-life situations, Louis wants a toffee in a general store
 uski maan manaa kar detii he
 He starts crying vah apane vyavhaar ko niyantrit nahin kar paata he
 Her response to Toffee's desire is spontaneous
 vah kahata bhi he, mujhase rulaai ruk nahin rahi he
 In the game he can control his behavior as he can control the fictitious state of the family
 vah general store jane or na rone kaa naatak kar saktaa he
 He can pretend to cry and stop crying
 vaastavik sthiti kii apeksha naatak use aise ucchtar str par kaam karne kaa avasar de saktaa he
 For example, five-year-old Jessica feels difficulty in sitting in a circle with the group in her class
 vah anya bacchon par ladati or saathwaale bachche se baat karti rahati he
 Despite the teacher's literal gestures and help, she cannot sit upright for more than three minutes
 iske vipareet jab vah apane doston ke saath skool-skool khel rahi hoti he tab vah daayre main baithne vaale abhyaas main kaaphi der sthir baith leti he
 While pretending to be a good student, she can pretend to be interested by concentrating meditation for ten minutes
 is prakaar khel use bhoomikaayen, niyam or sthiti pradaan karata he jo uske liye ucchtar str par dhyaan ekagra karnaa or dilchaspee lenaa sambhav banaata he, jaisaa ki vah is avlamb ke bina nahin kar paati
 If the child does not get the experience of sports, then we think his cognitive, emotional and social development will be damaged
 vaigotski ke shishyon leontev or alconinane unke is vichaar ko parishkrut karke yah avadharana banaai ki khel ek pramukh gatividhi he
 He says that sports is a very important activity for the development of children between three and six years old
 is daur main bachche vibhinn gatividhiyon se laabh pate hai kintu, leontev or alconin kaa vishwaas tha ki is aayu ke liye khel kii bhoomika anuthi he jiskaa sthaan anya koi gatividhi nahin le sakati he
 By saying "in the focus of a fiery glass", Vygotsky meant that new developmental skills first appeared in sports rather than in learning and other activities
 atah chaar saal kii umr main bachche kii aagaamee sambhaavnaaon kii bhavishyavaanee ke liye khel jitna upyukt he utana akshar pahchaanane jaisi academik gatividhiyaan nahin
 In a four-year-old child's play we can observe his attention, thinking and problem solving abilities at a higher level
 ham vastutah aagaamee kal ke bachche ko dekh rahe hote hai
 In the game, children work according to internal thought rather than external reality
 baccha ek chiz dekhtaa he, par jo dekhtaa he uski tulana main bhinn prakaar se vyavhaar karata he
 a situation arises when the child starts behaving independently of his sight
 chunki khel main ek vastu ko duusari kaa sthanapann banane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, baccha, vastu ke vichaar yaa arth ko vastu se alag karne kii shuruuaat kar detaa he
 When he uses a block as a boat, the idea of 'navigability' diverges from the actual boat
 jab block ko ek nauka bananaa ho to vah nauka kii jagah le letaa hai
 As preschool children get older, their ability to make choices in this way increases flexibility
 antat ek saadhaaran ishaare se yaa ‘maan lo’ kehane bhar se vastuon ko pratikon main badla ja saktaa he
 Separation of meaning from object is the preparation of abstract thought and abstract thinking
 amoort chintan main ham vaastavik jagat kii ore ishaara kiye bina apane vichaaron tathaa avadharanaon kaa moolyankan, istemaal tathaa sanchaalan karte he
 This action of separating the object from the concept is a preparation for the transition to writing, where the word is not something like the object reported by it
 ant main vyavhaar vastu dwaara sanchalit nahin rah jaataa, ab vah pratikriyaatmak nahin he
 Objects can be used as tools to understand other concepts
 blokon kaa prayog blokon kii tarah na karke baccha unka prayog kisi samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye, jaise ganit main sahaayta saamagree kii tarah karne lagata he
 Since roles and rules have to be performed according to the theme of the game, it is necessary for children to restrain and control their behavior
 khel main bachche manamaani nahin kar sakate, unhen sthiti ke anusaar kaary karnaa hoga
 Two and a half year old Louis is playing house to house and crying like an infant
 shishu kii tarah bhoomika hone main yah nihit he ki rote hue lui ko pita jab puchakaare to vah chup ho jaae
 His behavior is not in response to injury
 vah khel kii sthiti se niklaa he is rulaai main usee samaj-boojh kii aavashyaktaa he jiskaa prayog ucchtar maansik karyaan main kiya jaataa hai atah khel vah sandarbh pradaan karata he jisamen lui samajhe-buujhe vyavhaar kaa abhyaas kar saktaa he ; isse prakat hota he ki vah apane vyavhaar par kaabo paa saktaa he
 The game requires control and understanding more importantly than in other contexts, so the game creates an investment for higher mental tasks
 vaigotski ke sabhi vidhyaarthiyon main se keval echlonin ne hi apane shodh ko khel par kendrit kiya
 Through research, he tried to show the connection between the development of older children's learning activities and games
 alconin ne leontev kii pramukh gatividhiyon kii avadharana ko vistrut kiya or un visheshtaon ko bhi chihnit kiya jo khel ko ek pramukh gatividhi banaati hai
 According to Alconin, the game of young children between one and three years of age has its roots in the activities of hand-handling and its use of other equipment
 hast-prayog ke dwaara bachche vastuon kii visheshtaon kii talash karte hai or bane banaaen se unka istemaal karnaa sikhte hai
 Children then learn to use everyday objects in hypothetical situations
 is prakaar khel kaa janm ho jaataa he
 For example two-year-old Leela picks up a spoon and tries to eat from it
 vah chammach kaa istemaal keval mez par patakane ke liye nahin, chammach kii tarah rudh tareeke se karnaa sikh rahi he
 The first sign of the game emerges when eighteen-month-old John feeds his bear with a spoon or pretends to eat himself
 bachche ke dwaara dainik prayog kii saadhaaran vastuon kii chaanbin se khel kii shuruuaat hoti he
 In order to become a game of behavior, it is important that the child gives recognition to his work in words
 vyavhaar ko hastprayog se khel main badalane ke liye bhashaa kii bhoomika mahatvapurn hoti he
 The teacher asks the child, "will you feed your bear?"
 This way he helps the child who has just picked up the spoon to transition to the game
 bees maheene kii jodi apni khilonaa tank ko peeche se dhakelti or uski aawaaj sunati he
 Her teacher says, "why don't you bring your tank here? Bring and fill the stomach
 ‘‘jodi sunati he or apane tank ko chalaa kar shikshika ke paas le jaati he jo usamen petol bharne kaa abhinay karti hai
 Without this exchange of words and antics with the teacher, the pair would only be investigating the sound and speed of the tank wheels
 shikshika ke vyavhaar ne ek nayaa nivikshe taiyaar karke bacchon ke vyavhaar ko hast-prayog se aage ek or adhik parishkrut str tak pahunchaa diya
 At this stage the child may pretend to be someone else or use the object in a symbolic way
 piyaaje kii tarah alconin ne bhi pratikatmak kaary ko ek vastu kaa duusari vastu ke paryaay ke rup main prayog kah kar paribhaashit kiya he
 In order to get the status of the game, it is necessary to include symbolic presentation in the investigation of objects
 jab ek baccha kisi vastu ko dabaata, giraata yaa mez par patakata he to vah vastu ke saath haathon kaa prayog kar rahaa he
 It cannot be called a game
 agar vah kisi vastu ko baÿkha maan kar use mez par tairaa rahaa ho or use dableroti ke tukade khilaa rahaa ho to vah khel he
 According to Alconin in the early years of preschool the game is oriented towards the object
 khel ke kendra main vastu hoti he or aadan-pradaan main khilne waalon kii bhoomikaayen gaun hoti hai
 Three-year-old Joan and Tomajo play each other while playing house to house, saying, 'we are playing house to house, but don't pretend to play the roles of adults in our family
 va platen dhote hai, gas par rakhe patile, chamache hilaate hai or ek duusare se zyada baat nahin karte
 Compare this with the games of older children in preschool and kindergarten which are more social oriented
 paanch varsh ke bacchon ke liye patile main chamachaa chalaanaa or platen dhonaa un jatil bhoomikaaon ke liye ek sandarbh ban jaataa he, jinka ve abhinay karte hai
 Their play is not object-centered, the actions of washing and spooning can be summarized or even statements
 samajonmukh khel main bhoomikaayen baatcheet main tay kii jaati or adhik lambi avadhi tak abhinit kii jaati he
 The character the child is playing becomes that
 is prakaar kaa khel chaar se chah varsh tak ke bacchon ke liye saamaanya he lekin kisi na kisi rup main priskool kii puri avadhi main chalata rahata he
 In the Vygotsky framework, it is not compulsory for other children to participate in socially oriented sports
 baccha vah khel bhi khel saktaa he jise ‘nirdeshak kaa khel’ kaha jaataa hai nirdeshak ke khel main baccha apane kaalpanik saathiyon athwa khilaunon ke saath khel kaa nirdesan va abhinay karata he
 Isaac plays the symphony orchestration with the play of toys and dolls
 maaya skool-skool khelti he
 One moment she is a teacher and another moment she speaks on behalf of her student bear
 kuch pashchimi shodhakartaaon ke vipareet vaigotski ekaant main khele gayi sabhi khelon ko aparipakv nahin maanate hai
 If the child playing alone pretends to be there, then the director's game is equivalent to the imagined social game
 piyaaje ke vipareet vaigotskivaadi yah nahin maanate ki saat yaa aath varsh kii umr tak pahunchate-pahunchate samajonmukh khel samaapt ho jate hai
 Children up to the age of ten or eleven also play them, but as a major activity, their importance gradually disappears
 bachche jaise jaise bade hote hai vaise-vaise ve apane samajonmukh khelon ke liye or adhik spasht niyam viksit kar lete hai
 Six-year-old Frank says, "this is the bad guy and the bad guy always comes to catch the good guy
" ’’ meri jawaab detii he, ‘‘lekin vah pakad nahin paaegaa kyonki achche log zyada tej or unke hawaizhaj behatar hote hai, isliye ve nikal jaaenge
 "as he grows up, children spend more time deciding roles and tasks, and less in enacting the story than he does
" vastutah chah varsh ke bachche katha par vichaar-vimarsh karne main kai minute kharch karte hai or usko abhinit karne main keval kuch second
 It is a different type of game that emerges around the age of five
 yah kalpit sthiti vaale khel se is arth main bhinn he ki isamen kalpit sthiti prachhann rahati hai tathaa niyam prakat or vistrut rahete hai
 For example, in the game of chess an imaginary situation is created Why? Because in it horse, elephant, king, queen and so on, all others can only walk in a certain certain way
 gotiyon ke upar se jane or gotiyaan maarane ke niyam puri tarah se shatranj kii apni avadharanaen hai
 Although there is no direct replacement for real-life relationships in the game of chess, it is still a kind of imaginary situation
 ’’ Another example is the game of football
 is khel ke khilaadiyon ke liye gend ko haath se choona manaa he
 Football is a hypothetical situation in the sense that in real life the same player can use hands to move the ball but in football games the players agree that they will not use their hands, just like in a dramatic game
 Let's first decide what they can do during the game
 or kya nahin kar sakate
 Sports are different from socially oriented sports given the nature of balance between roles and rules
 samajonmukh khel main bhoomikaayen prakat hai, niyam prachhann
 The children talk about the roles and their expectations but the rules do not play havoc
 baccha tayshuda anukram se bhinn bhi kuch kar baithta he to usase khel main gadabad nahin hoti
 In contrast, the rules are clear in the game
 niyam tod kar krida chal nahin sakati
 Not all sports can be considered a major activity because behavior in all types of sports does not encourage development
 aagaamee adhigam ke liye bachche ko taiyaar karne vaale khel kii pramukh visheshtaayen nimnlikhit hai :- The emergence of some of these symptoms starts in children up to the age of three, but by the time they come out of kindergarten all these symptoms should develop in the child
 vaigotsaki or alconin ke anusaar, vistaarit avadhi tak jari rahane vaala naatak adhik aatmaniyantran, aayojan or smriti kii mong karke bachche ko nikat vikaas kshetra ke ucchtam staron kii ore dhakelta he
 At higher levels of the game, children use objects and functions in a symbolic manner, as a substitute for any other objects and tasks
 is str par khilne vaale bachche zarurat kaa thik vahi khilonaa yaa vastu na mili to apana khel band nahin kar dete
 They only use something else as a replacement
 yahaan tak ki ve bina kisi bhautik sthanapann ke, us vastu ke maujuud hone kaa bahaanaa bhi karne ko raji ho sakate hai
 At this stage, they also deal with actions in a symbolic manner
 imaarat ke girane kaa khel khilne ke liye ve kisi dhaanche ko giraae bina hi imaarat ko gira hua maan sakate hai
 All they need to say is, 'admit' has fallen
 is tarah ke avishkaar ko badhaava dene vaali sthitiyaan khel ko or bhi protsaahit karengi
 Higher games can have many themes, which are interwoven into one whole unit
 khel ke pravaah main bachche bina kisi rukaawat ke duusare logon, khilaunon or vichaaron ko shaamil kar lete hai
 They also integrate unrelated-looking themes in their imagined positions
 udhaaharan ke liye ambulance kii marammat kaa khel khelte samay ve achaanak kisi mistre kii tabiyat bighad jane kaa khyal bhi usamen jod sakate hai
 Now the doctor has to be called or the mechanic will have to be taken to the hospital is tarah ve garrej kii vishaywastu ko aspataal kii vishaywastu ke saath goonth dete hai
 Children can adopt multiple roles at the same time, coordinating them at a higher level
 nimnatar str par ve ek hi vishaywastu se judy rudh bhoomikaaye karte hai jaise mummy kii bhoomika main ve shishu ko doodh pilaate, platen dhote hai
 When the game comes to a higher level, the mother goes to work for work, goes to the hospital with the sick child, then treats the child by becoming a doctor, then the crying child also becomes, and after this the mother Returns to her original role
 ucchtar str par khel main samay ke vistaarit dhaanche se khel ke do paksh prakat hote hai
 One is how long the child can play the game
 vibhinn bhoomikaaon ke nirvaah ko baccha jitne hi lambe samay tak banaae rakh saktaa he, khel kaa str utana hi ucch hota he
 Secondly, whether the game lasts more than a day
 bade bachche, yuddh yaa aspataal kaa vahi khel kai-kai dinon tak lagaataar khel sakate hai
 a four-year-old child can also play a game for many days with help
 aarambhik balykaal ke shikshak khel ko vistaarit avadhi tak nahin chalaate
 They limit the game to mostly one day
 vaigotski or alconin, ke anusaar vistaarit avadhi tak jari rahane vaala naatak adhik aatmaniyantran, aayojan or smriti kii maang karke bachche ko nivikshe ke ucchtam staron kii ore dhakelta he
 When the teacher is advised to help in the game, it does not mean that they play with the children themselves or conduct the game by becoming a member of their group
 yaad, rakhen, khel ke liye bachche kaa sakriy or utsahit hona jaruri he
 Children play for various reasons
 vaisaa vayaskon ke saath unke aadan-pradaan main nahin hota he
 An exchange with an adult places the child in the role of subjugation
 shikshak chaahe jo bhi kare, baccha ek baccha hi bana rahata he
 Children adopt and try many roles in the game
 shikshak yadi khel main kuch zyada hi aguai karata he to bachche ko kabhi is baat kaa mauka nahin miltaa ki naatak karen
 Another disadvantage of this is that even the teacher will not get a glimpse of what is present in the choices of every child
 shikshak ke karyaan main bachche ke hi paksh ko ujagar karne kii pravriti hoti he
 By looking back and exchanging the child with his peers, the teacher will be able to understand what his / her prospects are in different social contexts
 bhinn saamaajik sandarbh shikshak ko bachche kaa vah paksh dikhaaenge jiskaa usko anya kisi tarah se pataa nahin chal saktaa he
 Nevertheless, the role of teacher's help in the game process is important
 kaksha main khel ke str par upyukt avlamb pradaan karne vaale samvedansheel shikshak kaa bahut sakaaratmak prabhaav padataa he
 Teachers can take the following measures to provide a foundation in the game: samrudh saamaajik khel ke liye vishyavastuon or bhoomikaaon ke vikaas ke liye priskool ke bade bacchon ko ek thos samay kii nishchit avadhi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 They need time each day so that the content can be moved from one day to another
 khel ke liye samay bhi paryaapt -tees se chalis minute tak - nirdhaarit hona chahie taaki khel nirbaadh rup se chal sake
 Sports are an important issue in kindergarten and first second grade
 kindergarton ke bacchon ko aam taur se skool main khel ke liye samay nahin diya jaataa he atah khel ke liye mishrit aayu samoohon kaa ek yah nakaaratmak parinaam ho saktaa he ki khel ke bheetar aadan-pradaan ke liye kindergarton ke bacchon kaa samay kam rah jayega
 Sports are not part of the daily schedule in the early elementary classes
 apeksha kii jaati he ki bachche madhyavkaash main khelenge
 We believe that sports are very important in the early years of school
 khel ke liye samay madhyavkaash ke alaava nishchit kiya janaa chahie athwa madhyavkaash kii avadhi ko badha dena chahie
 After the game is over, ask the children if they will run it tomorrow and inspire them to think about what to save for tomorrow
 agle din khel kii shuruuaat ke pehle pichley din kii yojana or gatividhiyon par nazar daaliye
 Remember, sticking to the plan is not a goal in itself
 yah keval ek saadhan he jo apane kaam main lage rahane main bacchon kii madad karata he
 Look at the level of the child's play
 agar vah mukhyatah vastuon se hi khel rahaa he to vikaas ke agle str tak le jane ke liye avlamb laabhprad hoga
 To help the child, the teacher can relate his play to some imaginary context
 udhaaharan ke liye mitti ke kek banaate hue bachche se poocha ja saktaa he ki ye kek tum khaane ke liye bana rahe ho yaa bazaar main bechoge? ’ kabhi-kabhi kaalpanik khel kii shuruuaat ke liye bas itnaa sa ishaara kaaphi hota he

 Three different types of plants are known as Punarnava in different parts of India
 ye hai- boarhevia difuja, irecta tathaa reependa
 ICMR Scientists in the field of botany have researched the field and have written off a lot of confusion by writing on this subject in a book titled 'medicinal Plants of India'
 unke anusaar boarhevia difuja, jiske pushp shwet hote hai, hi aushadhiy gunon vaali he
 Another similar type of vegetative, transanthella porpoise crustrum, is often mixed in the available market
 rakt punarnava ek saamaanya paayi jane vaali ghaas he jo sarvatra sadakon ke kinare ugi faili hui milti he
 White rejuvenation is much less accessible than blood species, so blood rehydration is often adulterated in white medicinal species
 pushp patrakon se nikalate hai, chhatari ke aakaar ke chote-chote safed 5 se 15 kii sankhya main hote hai
 Fruits are small and contain sticky seeds, they thrive in winter

 His father's name was Dubekar Antaji Malhar Barve
 radhabai balaji ke pita vishwanath bhatta siddiyon ke adheen shrivardhan gaanv ke deshmukh the
 Due to the absence of Western Siddis from India, Vishwanath and Balaji Shrivardhan left the village and started living with Bhanu brothers in a place called Bela
 radhabai bhi apane parivaar ke saath bela main rahane lageen
 After some time Balaji became Deshmukh of Dandarajpuri

 En route, local rulers arranged bodyguards for them
 mohammad khan bangash ne radhabai kaa bahut sammaan kiya or unhen bahumoolya uphaar pradaan kiye
 Radhabai was pleased and reached Poona on 1 June 1736 AD
 radhabai kii is yatra ne saadhaarant: maraathon ke liye or visheshkar peshwa bajirao ke liye mitraapurna vaataavaran kaa nirmaan kiya
 It was not even two years before Radhabai returned from the journey that she had to face another situation
 mastaani or bajirao kaa sambandh saradaaron kii aalochana kaa vishay ban chukaa tha
 The attitude of critics of Bajirao intensified when Raghunath Rao's Upanayana and Sadashiv Rao were to be married in the Peshwa family
 panditon ne kisi bhi aise kaary main bhaag na lene kaa nirnay kiya
 Radhabai wrote to Bajirao to be especially vigilant
 antat: radhabai uparyukt kaary karaane main safal hui
 Mastani and Bajirao's relationship was never given any special importance but always tried to ensure that there is no disunity in the family and the Peshwa family should remain respected
 chimaji appa ne mastaani ko kaid kiya
 Radhabai rescues Mastani from captivity and she approaches Bajirao
 bajirao ne bhi radhabai kii aajnaaon kaa paalan kiya
 Radhabai felt very sad due to Bajirao's death in April, 1740 AD
 paanch maah pashchaat hi chimaji appa kii bhi mrityu ho gai
 Now Radhabai's enthusiasm was relaxed
 phir bhi, jab kabhi aavashyaktaa padati thi, ve parivaar kii seva or rajkeey kaaryon main balaji bajirao ko uchit paraamarsh deteen thim
 In 1752 AD, when the Peshwa went to the south, Radhabai took measures to prevent the combined forces of Tarabai and Umabai from marching towards Poona
 duusare avasar par unhone babuji nike ko peshwa balaji ke viruddh anshan karne se roka
 Radhabai took an active part in erstwhile politics
 inke vyavhaar main kabhi bhi katutaa nahin aane paati thi
 He saw his family getting Peshwa status from a normal position

 After years of study, when Albert Einstein announced this theory in 1916, the world of science was stirred up and the universe's vision announced in 1687 by Isaac Newton was permanently reversed for two and a half years
 bhautik shaastra par iskaa itnaa gaharaa prabhaav padaa ki log aadhunik bhautikee ko shastreey bhautikee se alag vishay bataane lage or albert oinstin ko aadhunik bhautikee kaa pita mana jane laga
 Dik is a Sanskrit word meaning place around
 ise angreji main "spes" kehete hai
 Humans have the ability to steam the three aspects of a problem - top-down, forward-backward and right-left
 aam jivan main manushya dik main koi badlaav nahin dekhte
 Newton's physics used to say that if two objects in space are one kilometer away from each other and neither of them move, they will remain one kilometer away from each other
 hamaara rose kaa saadhaaran jivan bhi hamen yahi dikhalaataa he
 But Einstein said that it is not so
 dik khich or sikud saktaa he
 It is also possible that the two objects which are one kilometer away from each other, should not move themselves, but due to some circumstances the problem may spread to a quarter and a quarter or a quarter to a quarter
 newton kii shastreey bhautikee main yah kaha jaataa tha ki brahmand main har jagah samay kii raftaar ek hi he
 If you are sitting in one place and a friend decides to travel for ten years at half the speed of light, then after that journey, you will have passed ten years and your friend too
 lekin inastin ne is par bhi kaha ki yah vishwaas galat he
 When something moves at a speed, time becomes slower for it and the faster it moves, the slower it becomes
 aapkaa mitra agar apane hisaab se das varsh tak roshni se aadhi gati par yatra kar ke laut aae, to uske to das saal guzarenge lekin aapke saadhe gyaarah saal guzar chuke honge
 Einstein showed in the theory of relativity that in fact there is a four-dimensional dikala in the universe, consisting of three periods of time and one in which all things and energies are located
 yah dik-kaal sthai nahin he- na dik bina kisi badlaav ke hota he or na yah zaruri he ki samay kaa bahaav har vastu ke liye ek jaisaa ho
 It can be twisted, pulled, and shrunk by affecting the time period, and the same happens in the universe
 is siddhanth ke madhyam se hi samay yatra kii avadharana nirmit hui he
 The change in time produces every object and every speed, but large objects and speeds near light produce more changes
 manushyon kaa aakaar itnaa chota or uski raftaar itani dhimi he ki unhen saapekshata siddhant ke asar apane jivan main nazar hi nahin aate, lekin jab vah brahmand main or chizon kaa gaur se adhyayan karte hai to saapekshata ke chinh kai jagahon par pate hai
 When the velocity of the object becomes even 5% of the velocity of light, then we start to see the signs of the theory of relativity
 newton kaa maananaa tha ki har vastu main apni ore khinchne kii ek shakti hoti he jise usne gurutvkarshan kaa naam diya
 In a big thing like Earth, this gravity is very high, due to which we stick to the Earth and do not fly away from space in space
 lekin yah newton nahin bataa paye ki gurutvkarshan bal vastav main kis prakaar kaary karata he or kyon kaary karata he
 Einstein said that according to the theory of relativity, the idea that material things attract each other is an illusion, which has arisen due to wrong mechanical assumptions about nature
 unhone kaha ki prithvi badi he or uski vajah se uske ird-gird kaa dik-kaal mud gaya he or apane upar tah ho gaya he
 We live in this difficult time and because of this twist, we are pushed closer to the earth
 isaki tulana ek chadar se kii ja sakati he jiske chaar cono ko chaar logon ne khinch ke pakadaa ho
 Now if a heavy ball is placed in the middle of this sheet, then the sheet will sit in the middle, that is, its yarn will be bent in the middle
 ab agar ek halaki gend ham chadar ke kone par rakhe to vah ludak kar bade gole kii taraf jaaegi
 Einstein said that a clumsy man could see that the small ball was pulled by the big ball, so the ball went to him
 lekin asli vajah thi ki gend zamin kii taraf janaa chaahati thi or gole ne chadar main kuch aisi mudan paidaa kii ki gend uske paas chali gai
 Similarly, he said that it is a myth that gravity is caused by some attraction
 gurutvkarshan kii asli vajah he ki har vastu jo antariksh main chal rahi hoti he, vah dik ke aisi mudan ke prabhaav main aakar kisi badi chiz kii ore chalane lagati he
 In fact, gravity is only a part of inertia, the movements of stars and planets arise from their characteristic inertia and their path depends on the circular elements of time and time
 jis prakaar chumbak ke chaaron ore chumbakeey kshetra hota he usee prakaar khagoleey vastu apane chaaron ore ke akaash main ek kshetra bikherti he
 Just as the activity of an iron piece in a magnetic field is guided by the design of the field, similarly the path of an object in a gravitational field is determined by the geometric state of that field
 oinstin kaa gurutvkarshan sambandhi niyam dikkaal satati ke kshetreey tatwon kii jaankaree detaa he
 Primarily a part of this rule expresses the relationship of the structure of the field around the gravitational object
 inastin ke is sansani failaa dene vaale siddhant kaa ek bahut bada pramaan roshni par gurutvkarshan kaa asar dekhne se aayaa
 Newton's theory in physics was that two objects pull each other according to the mass of the two
 lekin prakaash kaa to dravyaman hota hi nahin, yani shunya hota he
 So, according to Newton, there is no question of something that does not have any mass or weight, but it can be pulled from the gravity of another object, no matter how big the other object is
 prakaash hameshaa ek sidhi lakeer main chalata hi rahata he
 But if Einstein is right and due to some big thing, the problem should be turned, then the light should also be turned with difficulty
 yani brahmand main sthit badi vastuon ko lens kaa kaam karnaa chahie- jis tarah chashme, doorabeen yaa sookshmbin kaa lens prakaash modta he usee tarah taron or grahon ko bhi modana chahie
 In 1924, a Russian physicist named Ostra Kholson predicted Einstein's theory of relativity, predicting that such gravitational lenses would be there in the universe
 pachpan saal baad, 1979 main pehali dafaa yah chiz dekhi gai jab twin kwasar naam kii vastu kii ek ke bajaae do-do chhaviyaan dekhi gai
 After that such images of far-flung objects have been seen in which some very large object is placed between those objects and the earth, which acts as lenses on the rays of light coming from the first object and either torsion its image
 Or show more than one image of him in the sky
