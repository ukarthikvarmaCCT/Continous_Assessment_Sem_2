 Karl Benz proposed to maintain cooperation between DMG and Benz & Cie
 When Germany's economic conditions began to deteriorate after World War I, dmg's speculators refused to accept it initially
 Negotiations between the two companies Several years later, when these conditions became worse, and in 1924, they made a document of mutual cooperation, which was valid till the year 2000

 And DMG eventually merged into the daimler-benz company and named all of its motor vehicles, Mercedes Benz, as a brand that equated the most important model DMG Automobilles, later singing the Maybach design of the 1902 Mercedes-35hp
 With the name of Benz on the form
 He remained a member of the board of directors of daimler-benz until his death in 1929, and sometimes his two sons were involved in the work of the company

 In 1877, George Selden of Rochester, New York designed the first design of an American automobile with a gasoline internal combustion engine, who requested for his patent in 1879, but the request was rejected because the vehicle was never built
 Neither ever came in handy
 After years of delays and adding several series to his application, Solah sang the American patent to Seldon in November 5, 1895, for his two-stroke automobile engine, which proved to be more obstructive than encouraging vehicles in America
 in the development of 
 His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others and was withdrawn in 1911

 This economic and social system of high wages and high efficiency was called "fordism" and was followed by most major industries

 As a result of this rapid change, where small pieces remained with each other, production took place in large quantities, each part at a lower cost
 For example, in the 1930s, La Salle, which sold Cadillac
 Used cheap mechanical parts made by Olds Mobile; similarly Chervole shared his hood, doors, roof and windows with Pontiacs; And by 1990, corporate drive trains and shared platforms, suspense and other parts) had become a common practice

 It would be almost the same in Europe
 In 1924, in Kavale, Maurice established his own production line and soon sold to Ford, although beginning in 1923, Ford's direct integration, which bought Hotchkiss, Wrigley, and Osberton, At the time, as well as partners, such as wolseley, Morris had 41% of total British car production in 1925

 Diesel engine cars were long known in Europe, with the first models introduced in the 1930s by Mercedes Benz and Citroën
 The main advantages of diesel engines were that they had a 50% higher burn efficiency when compared to the best gasoline engines
 , Which had 27%

 The carburetor was used in almost all road-going car engines until the 1980s, when it was used to obtain better control over the mixture of fuel and air, which was found by fuel injection
 Indirect fuel injection was first in aircraft engines
 Used in 1909, it was used in racing car engines in the 1930 Satak and was used in road cars since the 1950s

 After a small change, gasoline-powered vehicles can run at 85% ethanol concentrations
 00% ethanol is used in some parts of the world, but vehicles must be started on pure gasoline and then switched to ethanol
 When the engine is running
 Most of the gasoline powered engines are also run by LPG, where an LPG tank is used for fuel storage and LPG mixer is used for carbureation

 For some time, electrics were considered superior due to their silent nature when they were compared to the noisy gasoline engine
 This advantage was removed in 1897 by Muffler, the inventor of Hiram Percy Maxim
 Thereafter internal combustion The power cars had two significant advantages: 1) long range and 2) four specific energy
 The battery electric vehicle was built to rival the internal combustion model and they were Had to Tsar until modern semiconductor controls and improved starting batteries
 Because they could deliver a higher torque at lower resolutions, electric cars did not require such a complex drive train nor transmissions that internal combustion cars needed

 Esteem power, mostly used for oil - or gas - used boilers, was used until the 1930s, but its major disadvantage was that it could not provide electricity to the tax until boiler pressure was available
 This is that it gives very low emissions and because of this the combustion process can be controlled very carefully
 Its disadvantages include weak heat efficiency and expansion needs

 As an example, modern engine compartments are open from the bottom so that fuel vapors, which are filled with air, get out in the open air
 Brakes are hydraulic and dual circuits so that the possibility of brake failure from full star is very low
 Systematic research on accident safety started at Ford Motor Company in 1958
 Since then, most of the research is focused on absorbing external crash energy
 With crushable panels and in reducing the speed of the human body in the passenger compartment
 This is reflected in most cars that are made right now
