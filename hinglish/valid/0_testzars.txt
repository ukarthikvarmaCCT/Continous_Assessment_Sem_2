 There is no mention of bhukti as a unit of rule in the post-gupta period

 The empire of Parmar, Gahadwal, Chandel and Chalukyas were not more elaborate, no mention of bhukti
 bengal main paalon ke bade samrajya ke kaaran bhukti ke ullekh hai
 The use of Bhukti in Assam was probably due to the long-term relationship with the Palas
 guptottar kaal main samrajya kaa bahut bada bhaag saamanton ke adhikaar main hone ke kaaran centre dwaara shasit pradesh itnaa bada nahin tha ki use bhukti jaisi badi ikaayiyon main baanta ja sake
 The Rashtrakuta dynasty, which kept in touch with the Gangetic plain, gives names of some Bhuktis in some of its inscriptions, but there it was a division of the subject
 jo vartmaan taluk yaa tehsil jaisaa chota tha or usamen praaia: keval 50 se 70 tak gaanv hote the
 At some places, bhukti is not used in the specific sense of the division of rule; As in the Eda inscription Dandabhukti was a mandala under ‘vardhaman Bhukti’
 isi prakaar tirbhukti nagar ke naam ke rup main bhi prayukt hua he

 bina aagam ke sampatti kaa bhoga karanevaala chor ke tulya kaha gaya he kintu swaamitv siddh karne ke liye bhukti ko adhik mahatv diya jaataa tha
 If the transfer of property is written and co-opted, it will be doubtful if it is not free
 dharamshastron main bhukti or aagam ke tulanaatmak mahatv or dirghakaalin bhukti kii avadhi ke sambandh main, jisase swaamitv kii prapti hoti he, bada matbhed rahaa he
 Later commentaries have tried to eradicate these protests
 purvakaleen smritiyon ne 20 varsho tak anagam bhukti ko swaamitv ke liye paryaapt mana he, kintu uttarkalin smritiyon ne iskaa samay 60 varsh tak bataaya he
 Often, unofficial enjoyment of up to three generations has been said to be capable of generating ownership
 ek vivechna miltaa he ki maanav samaran kaal ke bheetar hi bhukti ko aagam kii apeksha hoti he smartkaal ke baahar teen pidiyon tak kaa bhoga paryaapt he

 It is popular in the continent, even among the non-resident Indians around the world, its demand is not less
 Generally its main ingredients are rice, spices, lentils, meat or vegetables

 There is also a hypothesis about it that it has its origin from the Persian word for rice, 'brines'

 andhra, dakshin bharat kaa ek maatr rajya he jisame biryani ke kisi sthaneey prakaar kaa vikaas nahi hua
 Lizzie Kollingham says that Biryani was developed as a confluence of dishes made from the Persian cuisine Pilaf and India's local spicy rice in the royal Mughal Bawarchi mines
 par ek vichaar yah bhi he ki babar ke bharat aagaman se purv hi biryani ek vyanjan ke rup me lokapriy jo chuki thi
 The Mughal document written in the 16th century ain-e-akbari finds no difference between Biryani and Pulav and according to this the word Biryani was already prevalent in India
 isi prakaar kaa ek or vichaar ki biryani bharat me temurlang ke akraman ke saath ai bhi tathyon par aadhaarit nahi he kyonki uske apane mul sthaan me uske daur me is vyanjan kaa koi pramaan nahi miltaa
 According to Pratibha Karna, Biryani is a dish of South Indian origin which is based on different types of Pilaf brought by Arab traders
 He believes that casserole is a military dish
 The army always lacked utensils to cook variety dishes, so they used to cook meat and all other ingredients with the same utensil along with rice
 Over time, many types of biryani have been developed based on different methods of cooking and the difference between casserole and biryani is arbitrary
 biryani restaraan kii ek prasiddh shrunkhlaa ke maalik vishwanath shenoy ke anusaar biryani kii ek shakha to mughalo ke saath bharat ai or duusari arab vyapaariyon ke dwaara dakshin bharat ke kalikat ke laai gayi thi
 The main ingredients of biryani usually include native ghee, nutmeg, mace, black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, big and small cardamom, bay leaves, coriander and mint leaves, ginger, garlic and onions
 Saffron is also used in its special type of cuisine
 Non-vegetarian type of Biryani is commonly used with spices, goat meat and chicken meat
 Biryani made from beef, pork meat and sea foods is also being made
 This dish is served with curd chutney or raita, korma, curry, boiled eggs and salad
 Biryani should always be made with basmati rice because aromatic and delicious biryani is prepared with basmati rice
 biryani do prakaar se banaai jaati he - pakki biryani or kachi biryani
 pakki biryani ko banane ke dauraan pake hue chaaval or maans kii paraten ek ke upar ek karke daali jaati hai
 kachi biryani me kachche chaaval or kachche tel masaale aadi ke mishran main lapete hue maans ko ek ke upar ek rakh ke pakaaya jaataa he
 yah aam taur par chikan or matan ke saath pakaaya jaataa he or kabhi-kabho hi jhinge or machhlee kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 banaate samay masaale vaale maans ko dahi me lapet kar haandy ke nichle bhaag me rakh diya jaataa he or iske upar chaaval rakh kar pakaaya jaataa he
 chaaval kii parat daalane se pehle aksar aalu bhi rakh die jate hai
 haandy ko goondhe hue aate se sil kar diya jaataa he taaki ve apni hi bhaap se pak sake or vyanjan ko parose jate samay hi yah sil hataai jaati he
 Although it is basically a non-vegetarian dish, vegetarian biryani is also made in India due to the large number of vegetarian people living in India
 Potato, cabbage, carrots and peas are used in vegetarian biryani
 Egg biryani is also a new type of experiment
 sthaan or avyavon ke prayog ke anusaar biryani ke pramukh prakaar hai :- sindhi biryani, hyderaabadi biryani, talashaseri biryani, kalakata biryani, ambur / vanimabadi biryani, memoni biryani, dindigul biryani, kalyani biryani Grand coalitions are a system in a multi-party parliamentary system, in which the two largest political parties are united, whose political ideologies are opposed

 Mahendra wants to know Bhavanand's introduction, because if Bhavanand had not been found, he could have lost his life
 bhavanand ne jawaab diya- meraa parichay jaanakar kya karoge? mahendra ne kaha - main jaananaa chahta hoon, aaj aapane meraa bahut upkaar kiya he
 Mahendra does not understand that the Saints can also be like dacoits

 Bhavanand's currency had changed suddenly
 vah ab dheer sthir prakruti kaa sanyasi nahin lag rahaa tha

 He fulfills his daily thirst with human blood, and he is always called for the meat of young women
 nevala ke paas kai shaitani sevakon kii ek mandali he jo uske liye maasoom logon kaa bandobast kar kaali pahari le chalata jahaan pishaach nevala aasaani se unka shikaar karata
 Mahua, Mahaguru, a tantric and many such mustard type of kidneys are present in his servant circle
 mahua naukaraani ke rup main bade hi nyaay parayan samajhe janevaale thakur pratap ke yahaan ghar par kaam karti
 One evening, Thakur sees him talking with Baku
 ye jaanate hue ki baku usee kaali pahari ke shaitanon kaa bashinda he, thakur fouran mahua ko dhamkee detaa he ki yadi vah dubaara us giroh se mili to use barkhaast kar degaa
 Despite this, Mahua follows the mongoose's intelligence orders as before
 vahiin thakur pratap behad dhan-sampada or sukhmay jivan ke baavjood, apni patni laajo kii koi santan nahin hone par udhaas rahete
 The priests of the local temple would have convinced her, but she would feel deeply inward when Thakur's aunt would come to her house and instruct her, asking her to remarry, citing the need of the dynasty
 vahiin mahua vachan dilaati he ki laajo ko santan prapti hogi yadi vah uske sang kaali pahari chale to, jahaan nevala uski muraad puri kar saktaa he, par kabhi aisi paristhiti bani ki yadi use betaa hua to vah use le ja sakati he or agar usne beti ko janma to vah nevala kii amaanat hogi or use vah saunpna hi padegaa
 Lajoie refuses at first, but Mahuja strongly admits that Lajoie accepts the deal
 parinamswaroop, laajo kaali pahari ko ravaanaa hoti he, jahaan use dudh se nahalaaya jaataa he or nevala prakat hokar use sammohit karata he
 At midnight, the mongoose makes a physical connection to Lajoie
 laajo puri tarah nevala ke vaseekaran main fasakar usase sambhog karne ko sahyog detii he
 Early in the morning, Lajo finds herself naked with a mongoose
 laajo haveli lautati he is baat se anbhigya ki nevala uski garbhvatee kar chukaa he or samay guzarate saath laajo ek bacchee ko janm detii he, kamya
 But when Mahua reminds her of the baby girl, Lajo falls into a state of almost zero and then walks away with her baby girl
 mahua apane maalik nevala ke nirdesh par vah vish laajo ko detii he
 Lajo then meets Thakur and narrates all the truth and tells him to save Kamya whom Mahua has taken to the Kali hill
 vahiin laajo lok-laaj ke bhay se vish khaakar mar jaati he
 Enraged, Thakur enters the Kali Pahadi and, follows a long duel, in which he cancels the mongoose's magical powers
 buree tarah jakhmi, nevala ladkadhaata hua apane tabut lautataa he or gupha kaa daravaaza band karata he or dubaara thik hone tak chirnidra main chalaa jaataa he
 After some twenty years, Kamya grows up as a beautiful young woman
 vah kumaar ko dil de baithti he, jo uskaa bachapan kaa pyaar he magar bachapan kii dillagi ke baavjood vah uski zyada parvaah nahin karti
 Kumar just wanted Sapna
 sapana mumbai sthit hostal main rahakar padhai kar rahi thi or aise hi roj uski ek aurat se bhent hoti he jo oos murdaani raat ko kaali pahari ke liye lift maangti he
 Sapna leaves him to the black hill but is unaware that he was left in a book car
 vah ek kaale jaadu-tone kii kitaab rahati he
 Sapna falls behind to return the book to the woman but she sees a woman there who is preparing to offer sacrifices to other priestly types
 yah drishy dekh sapana cheekh padati he
 Seeing the disruption in the sacrifice, the priest asks his men to get hold of him but he runs away and the book is also left in the black hill
 is vaakiye se ghabaraai sapana fouran kumaar ke ghar rukhsat hoti he or anand va use sabakuch bataa daalati he
 The next day these three leave the black hill, but they do not achieve anything as Sapna had said
 sapana kahati he ki vah neend main nahin thi or phir vah kitaab bhi mil jaati he jo pichhali raat usase chhut gai thi
 Then they go to meet Kamya who had invited these three to come on his birthday
 maamla tab dilachasp mode letaa he jab kumaar apane prem kii tasviir sapana ke saamne hi kamya ke janmdin par use uphaar detaa he
 Surprised by this, Kamya makes fun of Sapna causing Sapna to leave the place
 is bich kamya sidhe apane mudde par aati he, lekin kumaar use do took sunaakar chalaa jataahe
 Sapna, returning home, finds the same woman who was being sacrificed the previous night
 vah usase vahi kitaab maangti he or sapana kii car main baith jaati he
 Sapna reaches home and finds the book
 isi madhyahn, anand bich main hi party ko chhodkar gai sapana ko khojate hue uske ghar pahunchataa he
 Sapna tells about the unknown woman
 anand vah kitaab ghar se baahar phenk detaa he or yah sab soch ko band karne kahata he
 Kamya then goes to pick up the book where Kumar follows
 ghar pahunch kar vah kitaab padhanaa shuru karti he jisamen bataaya jaataa he ki jaadu-tone se kaise kumaar ko hasil kiya gaya
 While Kamya was giving a lift to the unknown woman, her car crashes, where the mongoose's gang men pick her up
 kamya ko uske jakhmon kaa ilaj us pujari ke kaale jaadu dwaara thik hota he or bataata he ki vah sabakuch paa sakati he yadi vah unke giroh main shaamil ho jaae to, vah maan jaati he
 Kamya practices witchcraft on Kumar in the cemetery
 vah vahaan pahunchataa he or usase pranay sambandh banaata he
 Anand and Sapna reach there and save Kumar
 anand ko us kabristaan main kumaar kii tasviren milti he or use yakeen pad jaataa he yah sari car-guzari kamya kii he jab usne kamya ko pehle bhi kaali pahari ke anjaan bashindon se milte dekha tha
 Every day Kamya is called on the nightly ritual on the Kali hill
 par darasal yah kamya ko phansakar nevala tak le jane kaa jaal tha jo barason kii neend se jaagaa tha
 He bites his bites to subdue Kamya and makes peace with him
 ab vah is band darvaaze ke peeche hameshaa ke liye kaid hoti he or nevala kii gulam banati he
 Kumar, Anand and Sapna all travel to Kali hill to save Kamya
 aakhirkaar ve use khoj lete hai, vah bamushkil se hosh main rahati he, vah kabron ke tahkhaane main rakhe shishe ke tabut main rahati he
 They try to save him that the place is filled with smoke and mongoose kidnaps him
 kamya ko vah tantric apane maalik nevala ke liye vasheebhoot karata he
 Now Kamya has to arrange more girls for her boss Mongoose
 vah bhanu ko apane jhaanse main phansakar kaali pahari le chalati he, lekin kumaar, anand or uske saathi tab tak bhanu ko nevala ke havas kaa shikaar banane se roak lete hai
 Kamya's next target becomes a dream
 sapana, bhi antat, ain vakt par batch jaati he, lekin kumaar or anand ko pataa chalata he ki kamya kisi anya ke vash main aakar aisa kar rahi he
 They tell all this news to Thakur, and decide that together they will end the Satan mongoose
 vahiin kaali pahari mapar kadam rakhte hi, thakur ko mahua se miltaa he, jo unhen suchit karti he ki shaitanon ne kamya ke janm par jaise jashn manaaya tha, or vahi kamya ab puri tarah nevala kii shaktiyon ke aage natmastak he
 In a fit of rage, Thakur beheads the mahua
 magar nevala ab ajey ho chukaa he
 He calls Bhanu again, and this time, he succeeds in stinging the sting
 nevala dubaara sapana par hamalaa karne ke liye, thakur ke ghar aa dhamkata he
 In a long haul, Mongoose now stands in front of Sapna after killing Bhanu and Anand, but at the last moment Thakur fails it
 or tab thakur, kamya ke janm rahasy ke bare main kumaar or sapana ko bataata he
 Then these three enter the black hill to find Kamya
 aakhirkaar ve use khoj lete hai, vah bamushkil se hosh main aati he, vah kabron ke tahkhaane main rakhe shishe ke tabut main rahati he
 But soon the mongoose itself jumps in with the gang members and other gangs stationed there to stop them
 in sabaki aapas main ladaai chhid jaati he or nevala ek baar phir ghayal hota he, magar use kisi bhi tarah maarna sambhav nahin hota
 That is when his evil servant and tantric escaped by loading the mongoose on the tang
 kumaar unka peechha karata he, or tantric ko daboch letaa he, tathaa use nevala kii kamajori ugalvaane ke liye jaan lene kii chetavanee detaa he
 The tantric then reveals that the soul of the mongoose is locked in the idol of Kali Pahadi and the sun's sun is its weakness
 kumaar or thakur ab donon raaston se nevala ko khatm karne kii chaal chalate he
 Kumar and Sapna lead the Tangay towards the Kali Pahadi, and with the help of the settlers intercept the mongoose
 nevala gusse se pagalaaya hua un sabpar hamalaa karata he
 Now he is able to reach the dream, he suddenly gets caught in pain and burns in shoals
 is tarah kumaar, sapana or thakur dwaara nevale kaa hameshaa ke liye nasht hote dekhne baad film samaapt hoti he

 saanchaa:admiralty law Marine insurance compensates for the loss or damage of ships, cargo, terminals, and any such transport or cargo by which property is transferred, acquired, or controlled from the original site to the destination
 yahaan charchit cargo beemaa samudri beemaa kii ek up-shakha he, haalanki samudri beemaa main tatwari evam apatati anaavruth sampatti ; jahaaj kaa dhaancha; samudri durghatana; or samudri deyta bhi shaamil he
 Marine insurance was the first well-developed insurance, beginning with Greek and Roman marine loans
 pruthak samudri beemaa anubandhon kaa vikaas chaudaavin sadi main genoa evam anya italvi shaharon main or vistaar uttari europe main hua tha
 Its premiums varied based on intuitive estimates of variable risk from weather and bandits
 angrezi kaanoon main samudri beemaa kaanoon ke aadhunik mul vyapaaree kaanoon main the jisaki sthapana 1601 main england main anya nyaayalayon se pruthak aashwaasan ke ek vishesh chembar se hui thi
 In the mid-eighteenth century, the Lord Chief Justice named Lord Mansfield began to merge the principles of merchant law and common law
 lloyds of landan kii sthapana, pratiyogi beemaa companiyon, visheshgyon kii ek vikasshil buniyadi suvidhaon or british samrajya ke vikaas ne angrezi kaanoon ko is kshetra main pramukhataa pradaan kii jiskaa rakrakhaav yah bade paimaane par karata he or lagbhag sabhi aadhunik prathaon ke aadhaar kaa nirmaan karata he
 The development of the London insurance market resulted in the standardization of policies and judicial precedents, leading to the development of maritime insurance law
 1906 main samudri beemaa adhinium paarit hua jisamen pichley saamaanya kaanoon samhitabaddh tha; yah ek atyant adyopant evam sankshipt kaary donon he
 Although the title of the Act refers to marine insurance, general principles have been applied to all non-life insurance
 19veen sadi main, lloyds evam institute of landan underriters ne samudri beemaa ke upyog ke liye aapasi samajhaboojh se manakikrut khandon ko viksit kiya or tab se inhen banaae rakhaa gaya he
 These are known as institute clauses because the institute used to pay for the cost of their publication
 samudri beemaa adhinium or institute clockez ke samgr morganirdesan ke bheetar vibhinn party apane darmyaan yathesht anubandh swatantraaa ko barkaraar rakhte hai
 Marine insurance is the oldest type of insurance
 isamen se gaiyr-samudri beemaa or punarbeema kaa vikaas hua
 This constituted much of the business traditionally embedded in Lloyds
 aajkal, samudri beemaa ko aksar vimaanan evam parivahan jokhimon ke saath samoohikrut kiya jaataa he or is rup main ise sankshipt shabd 'emeti' dwaara janaa jaataa he
 The Maritime Insurance Act includes a schedule known as a standard policy), the parties were at liberty to use it if they wished
 chunki policy kii prayek avadhi ko kam se kam nyaayik misaal kii kam se kam do sadiyon tak parikshan kiya gaya tha, isliye policy puri tarah se adyopant thi
 However, it was also expressed in relatively old words
 1991 main, landan bazaar ne ek nae maanak policy ke prakatikaran ko prastut kiya jise emr 91 form ke rup main janaa jaataa tha or institute clockez kaa istemaal kiya
 The MAR form is simply a general statement of insurance; Institute clauses are used to determine the extent of insurance cover
 abhyaas main, policy dastauez main aam taur par ek cover ke rup main istemaal kiya jane vaala emr form shaamil hota he or saath main clockez ko andar stepal kar diya jaataa he
 Typically each clause will be stamped and together this seal is both within the cover and on the other clauses; This practice is used to avoid the substitution or removal of clauses
 chunki samudri beemaa aam taur par sadsyta ke aadhaar par antarlikhit hota he, emr form kii shuruyaat hoti he: ham, hamidaar, apane khud ke hisse ke liye or kisi or ke liye nahin khud ko baadhya karne ke liye sahamat he 
 kanoonee maamalon main, policy ke tahat deyta kai, na ki sanyukt hote hai; arthath
 sabhi hamidaar ekasaath uttaradaayi hote hai, lekin sirf apane jokhim ke hisse yaa anupaat ke liye
 If a customer defaults, the remainder are not liable to take part of their claim
 aamtaur par, samudri beemaa ko jahaajon or cargo ke bich vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Ships' insurance is generally known as' plow and machinery '
 cover kaa ek or adhik simit form 'total los only' he, jiskaa istemaal aam taur par ek punarbeema ke rup main kiya jaataa he, jo keval jahaaj kii sampoorn kshati, na ki kisi aanshik kshati, ko cover karata he
 Cover can be given on either 'travel' or 'time' basis
 'yatra' ke aadhaar par policy main nirdhaarit bandargahon ke darmyaan parivahan shaamil hota he; 'samay' ke aadhaar par ek samyavadhi, aam taur par ek varsh, shaamil hota he or yah adhik aam he
 a maritime policy usually consisted of only three quarters of the liabilities of the insured person or item to third parties
 vishisht dendariyon kaa udai kisi duusare jahaaj se takaraav ke sandarbh main hota he, jise 'takaraav' or malba nishkasana ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 In the 19th century, shipowners group together into mutual underwriting clubs known as Protection and Independence Clubs to insure the remaining one-fourth of their liability between them
 ye club aaj bhi maujuud hai or anya vishisht evam avanijyik samudri evam gaiyr-samudri paraspar tathyon, udhaaharan ke taur par tel pradooshan evam parmanvik jokhim ke sambandh main, kaa model ban gaya he
 These clubs operate on the basis of consent to accept the owner of a ship as a member, and an initial 'call'
 sanchit nidhi ke saath, punarbeema ko karidaa jayega; haalanki, haani kaa anubhav pratikul ho to ek yaa ek se adhik 'anupoorak kol' kiye ja sakate hai
 These clubs also generally attempt to create reserves, but this puts them in difficulty with their mutual status
 chunki deyta kii paddatiyaan duniya bhar main badalati rahati hai, isliye beemaa companiyaan aam taur par america jones adhinium kii deyta ko simit yaa nishkasit karne ke liye saavdhaanee baratati hai
 These two terms are used to establish a difference in the level of evidence where a ship or cargo has suffered a loss
 ek vaastavik kul haani us sthiti ko sanderbhit karti he jahaan sthiti spasht hoti he or ek rachanaatmak kul haani us sthiti ko sanderbhit karti he jahaan ek haani sabit ho gai he
 In practice, a constructive total loss can also be used to describe a loss where the cost of repair is not economical; That is, a 'deficit'
 vibhinn shabd ek haani ko sabit karne kii mushkilon ko sanderbhit karte hai jahaan ho saktaa he ki aise kisi haani kaa koi saboot na ho
 In this regard, marine insurance is different from non-marine insurance, where the insured person or item has to prove its loss
 paramparaagat rup se, kaanoon main, samudri beemaa ko 'saahas' kii ek beemaa ke rup main dekha jaataa tha or saath main bimaakrit vyakti yaa vastuyon kaa vastu-vishay ke astitv ke vittiya parinaamon main keval ek byaaj ke bajaay jahaaj or / yaa cargo main ek hissaa or ek byaaj hota tha
 The word 'average' has two meanings: samudri beemaa main, aanshik haani ke maamle main, yaa jahaaj ke apatkaaleen marammat ke maamle main, everej kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 This includes situations where, for example, some cargo may have to be thrown to protect a ship trapped in a storm and the remaining cargo
 'saamaanya everej' ke liye unalogon kii haniyon kii kshatipurti karne ke liye udhyam se sambandhit sabhi pakshon ko is kshatipurti main yogadan dena padataa he jin logon ke cargo kii haani yaa kshati hui he
 The 'special average' is applied only to a group of cargo owners, not all cargo owners
 us sthiti main jahaan ek bimaakrit vyakti yaa vastu antar-bimaakrit hoti he, arthath, us vastu ke mulya se kam kii beemaa kii gai ho, to dey raashi ko kam karne ke liye everej lagu kiya jayega
 everej kii gananaa karne ke vibhinn tareeke hai, lekin kisi bhi shesh bhugtan ke liye aam taur par antar-beemaa kaa ek samaan anupaat lagu kiya jayega
 An average adjuster is a maritime claims specialist who is responsible for adjusting and providing a general average statement
 use aam taur par jahaaj ke maalik yaa bimakarta dwaara niyukt kiya jaataa he
 An additional amount is the sum payable to the insured person and is usually expressed as the first amount that comes in the balance until a sealing in the event of a loss
 ek atirikt raashi ko lagu kiya yaa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be expressed in either monetary or percentage terms
 ek atirikt raashi kaa istemaal aam taur par naitik sankat ko dur karne or chote-chote dawaaon ko hataane ke liye kiya jaataa he, jise sanbhaalanaa anupaatahinpurvak mahangaa hota he
 The equivalent term of 'excess' in marine insurance is 'deductible' or 'retention'
 aam taur par gaiyr-anupaatik sandhi punarbeema main lagu kii jane vaali ek sah-beemaa, ek daawey ke anupaat, udaahranarth 5%, ke rup main vyakt kii gai ek adhikta he, jise sampoorn daawey main lagu kiya jaataa he
 a franchise is a deductible below which nothing is payable and above which the entire sum of the sum assured is payable
 iskaa istemaal aam taur par punarbeema antarpanan samjhauton main kiya jaataa he
 Both of these are obsolete forms of initial reinsurance
 takneekee drushti se donon hi gaiyrkanoonee hai, kyonki isamen koi bimyogy byaaj nahin hota he or isliye kaanoon kii drushti se lagu karne yogya nahin the
 The ppis are generally used on these policies

 us haani tak pahunchane yaa use paar kar jane par policy kaa bhugtan ho jaataa tha
 a 'chinaman' applied the same principle but in the opposite way: in this way, payments were made when the limit was not reached

 In English law, a condition generally describes the part of the contract that is the fundamental part of the performance of that contract and, if it is breached, the non-breaching party must not only claim damages, but on this basis The right to terminate that contract also attains that the violating party has abandoned it
 iske vipareet, ek varantee anubandh ke pradarshan kaa moulik bhaag nahin he or ek varantee kaa ulanghan, jabaki kshati ke liye ek daawey ko badhaava detaa he, ulanghan na karne vaale party ko anubandh ko samaapt karne kaa adhikaar nahin detaa he
 These terms have opposite meanings in insurance law
 is prakaar, samudri beemaa adhinium 1906 lagu varantee ko sanderbhit karata he jo unamem se sabase mahatvapurn main se ek he ki jahaaj samudr main chalane yogya he
 The term 'salvage' refers to the practice of assisting a ship to be endangered
 is vichaar ke alaava ki samudr paramparaagat rup se 'suraksha kaa ek sthaan' he or saath main aavashyaktaanusaar sahaayta pradaan karne ke liye navik pratishthabaddh he, yah spasht rup se hamidaaron ke hit main hota he jisase sankatagrast jahaaj ko nasht hone se bachaane ke liye sahaayta pradaan karne kaa protsaahan miltaa he
 a policy usually includes a 'lawsuit and labor' clause which will compensate the reasonable costs incurred by the shipowner to protect themselves from very large losses
 samudr main, sangatgrast jahaaj aam taur par kisi bhi sambhavit sailver ke saath 'lloyds open form' ke liye sahamat hoga
 The Lloyds open form is a standard contract, although other forms of it also exist
 lloyds open form kaa sheershak 'no kyor - no pe' he; iskaa iraadaa yah he ki yadi nistaaran kaa prayaas vifal hota he to koi puraskaar nahin diya jayega
 haalanki, yah siddhant haal ke varshon main kamjor pad gaya he or ab puraskaar un maamalon main die jate hai jahaan, haalanki ho saktaa he ki jahaaj dub gaya ho, pradooshan se bachaa jaataa he yaa ise kam kiya jaataa he
 In other circumstances, "salver" can invoke scopic words, unlike Loaf, these words mean that the salver will still be paid if the disposal is unsuccessful
 sailver ko jo rakam miltaa he vah keval nistaaran ke prayaas kii laagat kii bharpai karne ke liye simit hota he
 One of the main negative factors in Scopic's call is that the amount that Salver can claim under Article 13 of Loaf is exempted if the disposal effort is successful
 ek baar sahamat ho jane par lloyds open form nistaaran prayaason ko turant shuru karne kii anumati detaa he
 The extent of any award is determined later; Although the standard term refers to the chairman of Lloyds deciding any award, the role of the adjudicator in practice is that of expert q to Lloyd's, passed to any expert QC passed for any award
 yuddh main pakade gaye jahaaj ko ek inaam ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he or ise pakadaney yaa is par kabza karne vaale inaam ke paise ke haqadaar hote hai
 This time too, this risk is offset by standard policies
 is adhinium ke sabase mahatvapurn khandon main shaamil hai: Schedule 1 of the Act includes a list of definitions; Schedule 2 contains the wording of the model policy

 After this, Nero killed another woman's husband so that he could make her his wife

 Finding the clue of a conspiracy, he ordered his mentor Seneca to commit suicide

 In the year 64, a very mysterious fire erupted in the city of Rome causing more than half of the city to burn
 jab aag dhudhu kar ke jal rahi thi nero ek sthaan par khadey hokar uski vinashlila dekh rahaa tha or saarangi baja rahaa tha
 Although some people believe that the fire was set by Nero himself, there is virtually no basis for understanding this
 aag bujh jane ke baad nero ne nagar ke punarnimani kaa kaary aarambh kiya or apane liye 'swarna mandir' naamak ek bhavy prasaad banwaaya
 Due to unbearable taxation, governance evils and many brutalities, the spirit of rebellion against him increased
 spain ke roman governor ne apni phujon ke saath rome par hamalaa bol diya jisamen swayan nero ko angrakshak sena bhi shaamil ho gai
 Nero had to flee the kingdom

 prithviraj raso hindi bhashaa main likhaa ek mahakavy he jisamen prithviraj chouhan ke jivan or charitra kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 Its author Rao Chand Bardai Bhatt who was from the Kaladi Gautra of Chandisa Rao and was a childhood friend and prince of Prithviraj and also encouraged the army with poems of Veer Ras during his war travels
 1165 se 1192 ke bich jab prithviraj chouhan kaa rajya ajmer se dilli tak failaa hua tha
 Prithvirajasso is a huge treatise of two and a half thousand pages which has 69 times
 pracheen samay main prachlit praayah sabhi chhandon kaa isamen vyavhaar hua he
 The main verses are Kavitta, Duha, Tomar, Trotak, Gaha and Arya
 jaise kadambari ke sambandh main prasiddh he ki uskaa pichhlaa bhaag baan bhatta ke putr ne puraa kiya he, vaise hi raso ke pichley bhaag kaa bhi chand ke putr jalhan dwaara purna kiya gaya he
 According to Raso, when Shahabuddin Ghori imprisoned Prithviraj and took him to Ghazni, then Chand went there a few days later
 jate samay kavi ne apane putr jalhan ke haath main raso kii pustak dekar use purna karne kaa sanket kiya
 The handing over of Rasohan to Raso and its completion is mentioned in Raso - raso main die hue sanwaton kaa aitihaasik tathyon ke saath anek sthanon par mail na khaane ke kaaran anek vidwaanon ne prithvirajraso ke samasamyik kisi kavi kii rachana hone main andeh karte he or use 16veen shatabdi main likhaa hua granth tehraate hai
 The oldest copy of this composition is found in the official library of Bikaner, there is a total of 3 copies
 rachana ke ant me prithviraj dwaara shabd bhedi baan chalaa kar gauri ko maarane kii baat bhi kii gayi he
 Prithvirajasso is a poet of the Rasak tradition
 jaisaa iske naam se hi prakat he, dilli ke antim hindu samrat prithviraj ke jivan kii ghatnaon ko lekar likhaa gaya hindi kaa ek granth jo raav chandvardaai bhatta kaa likhaa mana jaataa rahaa he
 Earlier, Hindi was familiar to only one form of this poem, which incidentally was the most elaborate form of composition, it contained about eleven thousand metaphors
 uske baad rachana kaa ek usase chota rup kuch pratiyon main mila, jisamen lagbhag saadhe teen hajaar roopak the
 After that, a form was obtained in few copies, in which the total metaphor did not exceed twelve hundred
 tadnantar do pratiyaan uski aisi bhi praapt hui jinamein kramash: chaar sau or saadhe paanch sau roopak hi the
 All these copies presented various complete forms of composition
 rachana ke kuch khandon kii pratiyaan bhi praapt hui hai, jinka sambandh uparyukt pratham do roopon se rahaa he
 Thus, naturally a dispute arose as to how the various complete forms mentioned above developed
 kuch vidwaanon ne isse sarvatha bhinn mat prakat kiya
 He said that the biggest form must have been the original form of the composition and from that only progressively smaller forms would have been presented as abbreviations
 inhone iskaa pramaan yah diya ki rachana kaa koi rup, yahan tak ki sabase chota rup bhi, anaitihaasikta se mukt nahin he
 But this dispute was then abandoned here and no attempt was made to resolve it for a long time
 iskaa pratham ullekhneey prayaas 1955 main hua
 When a scholar wrote the article titled The Relation of the Three Texts of Prithviraj Raso, it showed that the numbers that represent the forces of Prithviraj and his opposition are found in three different texts of composition: the largest, the smaller and the smaller
 And if looked at as a whole, the quantity of exaggeration in relation to these numbers is also reduced progressively in the above mentioned sequence
 yadi ye paath brihatmadhyamalaghulaghutam kram main viksit hue hote, to sankshep kriya ke kaaran balaabal suchak sankhyaon main koi antar na miltaa
 Therefore it is evident that the sequence of development of the obtained forms is the shortest
 prabandh kii drushti se yadi ham rachana kii uktishrinkhalaaon or chandashrankhalaon tathaa prasangashrinkhalaaon par dhyaan den to vahaan bhi dekhenge ki ye shrinkhalaayen laghutmalaghumadhyambrihat kram main hi uttarottar adhikadhik tuuti hai or bich bich main isi kram se adhikadhik chand or prasang prakshepakartaataon ke dwaara rakhe gaye hai
 But even the smallest form of composition is not completely free from these series of errors, so it is clearly known that the original form of 'raso' must have been smaller than the shortest form
 'prithvirajraso' kii katha sankshep main is prakaar he : prithviraj jis samay dilli ke singhaasana par tha, kannauj ke raja jayachand ne rajasuya yajna karne kaa nishchay kiya or isi avasar par usne apni kanya sanyogita kaa swayamvar bhi karne kaa sankalp kiya
 He sent the invitation of Rajsuya to far-flung kings and invited Prithviraj to join him
 prithviraj or uske saamanton ko yah baat khali ki bahuvachanon ke hote hue bhi koi anya rajasuya yajna kare or prithviraj ne jayachand kaa nimantran asweekaar kar diya
 Even then Jaichand determined to perform the Rajasuya Yajna and installed a statue of Prithviraj as the gatekeeper at the door of the Yagyamandap
 prithviraj swabhaavat: is ghatana se apmaan samajhakar kshubdh hua
 Meanwhile, she also got the news that Jaichand's daughter Sanyogita has resolved to disguise Prithviraj as a husband, ignoring the father's words, and Jaichand is enraged at this and has sent her to a different Gangsattar residence
 in samaacharon se santapt hokar vah rajdhani ke baahar akhet main apana samay kisi prakaar bitaa rahaa tha ki uski anupasthiti se laabh uthaakar uske mantri kaivas ne uski ek karnaati daasi se anuchit sambandh kar liya or ek din raat ko uske kaksh main pravisht ho gaya
 When Pattaragini came to know about this, he immediately called Prithviraj and Prithviraj came to the Raj Bhavan in two clocks at night
 jab use ukt daasi ke kaksh main kaivas ko dikhaaya gaya, usne raatri ke andhkaar main hi unhen lakshya karke baan chode
 The first arrow missed but as soon as the second arrow started, the canvas collapsed
 rato raat donon ko ek gadde main gadwakar prithviraj akhet par chalaa gaya, phir duusare din rajdhani ko lautaa
 When the woman from Kaivas prayed to Chand to get her dead husband's body, Chand requested Prithviraj
 prithviraj ne chand kaa yah anurodh is shart par sweekaar kiya ki vah use apane saath le jaakar kannauj dikhayega
 Both friends hugged and cried
 prithviraj ne kaha ki is apmaanpurn jivan se maran acha tha or uske kavimitra ne uski is bhaavana kaa anumodan kiya
 His widow became Sati by taking the dead body of Canvas
 chand ke saath thawitt ke shesh main prithviraj ne kannauj ke liye prayaag kiya
 He also took hundred brave Rajput feudal soldiers together
 kannauj pahunchakar jayachand ke darbar main gaya
 Jaichand welcomed him a lot and asked him about Prithviraj's age, form etc
 chand ne uskaa jaisaa kuch vivaran diya, vah uske anuchar thawitt main dekhakar jayachand kuch sashankit hua
 He called a maid along with other maids, who had previously served Prithviraj, on the pretext of offering a drink to the poet
 usne prithviraj ko thwitt ke vesh main dekhakar sir dhank liya
 But someone said that Chand was an integral part of Prithviraj, so the maid covered her head after seeing her and the matter ended there itself
 kintu duusare din praat: kaal jab jayachand chand ke dere par usase milane gaya, thawitt ko singhaasana par baitha dekhakar use pun: shankaa hui
 Chand tried to alleviate his doubts by making excuses and asked Thawitt to offer him a drink
 paan dete hue thawitt veshi prithviraj ne jo vakr drushti phenki, usase jayachand ko bhalee bhanti nishchay ho gaya ki yah swayan prithviraj he or usne prithviraj kaa saamana datakar karne kaa aadesh nikaala
 Here Prithviraj went out to revolve around the city
 jab vah ganga main machhliyon ko moti chuga rahaa tha, sanyogita ne ek daasi ko usko thik thik pahchaanane tathaa uske prithviraj hone par apana premanivedan karne ke liye bheja
 When the maid decided that she was Prithviraj, she pleaded for coincidence
 prithviraj tadnantar sanyogita se mila or donon kaa us gangatatavarti awaas main panigrahan hua
 At that time he left from there, but at the behest of his feudal lords, he again came to know and brought with him coincidence
 jab usne is prakaa sanyogita kaa apharan kiya, chand ne lalkaakar jayachand se kaha ki uskaa shatru prithviraj uski kanya kaa varan kar ab usase daayaj ke rup main yuddh maang rahaa tha
 As a result, conflict started on both sides
 do dinon ke yuddh main jab prithviraj ke anek yoddha maare gaye, saamanton ne use yuddh kii vidha badalane kii salaah di
 He suggested that he proceed towards Delhi with Sanyogita and that he should prevent Jaichand's army from proceeding in the path of Delhi till he reached Delhi with Sanyogita
 prithviraj ne is sweekaar kar liya or anek saamanton tathaa shur veeron yauddhaon kii bali ne ananthar sanyogita ko lekar dilli gaya
 Jaichand returned to Kannauj with his army
 dilli pahunchakar prithviraj sanyogita ke saath, vilasamagn ho gaya
 He did not get out of the house for six months, which resulted in resentment in his Guru, Bandhav, Bhatia and Lok
 praja ne raajaguru se ksht kaa nivedan kiya to raajaguru chand ko lekar sanyogita ke awaas par gaya
 Together, they sent Prithviraj a magazine listing of Ghori's attack and sent it to the messenger maid: 'gori rattatuadhara tu gori anurat
 ' raja kii vilasanidra bhang hui or vah sanyogita se vidaa hokar yuddh ke liye nikal padaa
 Shahabuddin had brought a huge army this time
 prithviraj ke anek shur yoddha or samant kannoj yuddh main hi maare ja chuke the
 As a result, Prithviraj's army returned from the battlefield and Shahabuddin emerged victorious
 prithviraj bandi kiya gaya or gazani le jaaya gaya
 After a few days there Shahabuddin got his eyes removed
 jab chand prithviraj ke kashton kaa samachar mila, vah gazani apane mitra tathaa swami ke uddhaar ke liye avadhoot ke vesh main chal padaa
 He met Shahabuddin
 vahaan jane kaa kaaran poochne par usne bataaya ki ab vah badarikashram jaakar tap karnaa chahta tha kintu ek saadh uske ji main shesh thi, isaliye vah abhi vahaan nahin gaya tha
 He took birth with Prithviraj and they played together in childhood
 usee samay prithviraj ne usase kaha tha ki vah singini ke dwaara bina fal ke baadh se hi saat ghadiyaalon ko ek saath bedh saktaa tha
 He could not see this skill of his, and now seeing that he wanted to complete his practice
 gori ne kaha ki vah to andhaa kiya ja chukaa he
 Chand said that he could still show the same skill, he believed it
 shahabuddin ne uski yah maang sweekaar kar lee or tatsambandhi sara aayojan karaayaa
 Disappointed with life on Chand's encouragement, Prithviraj also accepted his request to kill the enemy on the pretext of showing his confederation skills
 prithviraj se sweekruti lekar chand shahabuddin ke paas gaya or kaha ki vah lakshyavedh tabhi karne ko taiyaar hua he jab vah swayan apane mukh se use teen baar lakshavedh karne kaa ahvaahan kare
 Shahabuddin accepted it as well
 1 Shah gave two orders, then the third one gave as soon as he got hit by Prithviraj's arrow and he was dashed
 prithviraj kaa bhi ant hua
 The gods inflicted wreaths on him and the earth exulted after getting a descent from Mlechha Ghori
 yahan par 'prithvirajraso' kii katha samaapt hoti he
 There has been a huge controversy over the historicity of 'raso', especially since famous scholar and archaeologist Vuilar got a fragmented copy of Sanskrit poetry called 'prithviraj Vijay'
 yah vivaad uske brihat paath ko lekar chalaa he, kintu rachana kaa laghutam paath tak aisa nahin he jo anaitihaasikta se sarvatha mukt ho
 For example, Jaichand mentions that Karna of Dahl was defeated and imprisoned twice, but he was about one hundred hundred years before Jaichand
 jayachand se hue kahe gaye prithviraj ke yuddh ke sambandh main koi nishchit aitihasika samarthan abhi tak nahin praapt ho sakaa he
 Prithviraj was the ruler of Ajmer; The ruler of Delhi was a Govindarai or Khanderai who fought both the wars on behalf of Prithviraj and was killed in another war
 musalmaan itihaaskaaron ke anusaar gori se prithviraj ke keval do yuddh hue the, 'raso' ke anusaar kam se kam chaar yutra hue the3⁄4 jinamein se teen main shahabuddin parajeet hua tha or bandi kiya gaya tha
 According to Muslim historians, Prithviraj was captured and killed near Saraswati, after being defeated, while according to 'raso' he died by killing Shahabuddin in Ghazni as mentioned above
 ye anaitihaasik ullekh or vivaran 'prithvirajraso' ke samast roopon main paae jate hai or inamen se adhikartar uske taane bane ke hai, isaliye uske kisi bhi punarnimit rup main bhi paae jaanenge
 Therefore one has to believe that none of his forms can be a contemporary creation of Prithviraj
 prashn yah he ki 'raso' kis samay kii rachana maani ja saktaa he
 Some time later, the famous investigative scholar Muni Jinvijay found a copy of two 'jain Prabandha' collections in Jain Bhandars, comprising 'prithviraj Prabandha' and 'jaichand Prabandha'
 in prabandhon main jo chand uddhrut the unamem se kuch 'prithviraj raso' main bhi mili, yadhyapi in uddharanon kii bhashaa main 'raso' kii bhashaa kii apeksha pracheenta adhik surakshit thi
 In both the copies, 'prithviraj' management was often integral and one of the arrangements was copy no
 It was 1528
 inase munijee ne yah parinaam nikaala ki chand avashya hi prithviraj kaa samakaleen or uskaa raajakavi tha
 But this result will not be a logical conclusion
 in tathyon ke aadhaar par ham itnaa hi kah sakate hen ki chand ko rachana kaa koi na koi rup sanwat 1528 ke pehle praapt tha, jisase lekar ve chand ukt 'prithvirajprabandh' main uddhrut kiye gaye
 That form no
 In relation to how much pre-1528 would have been built, it can be said from some estimates, for which the following grounds can be taken: uddhrut chhandon main se ek 'raso' ke laghutam paath kii pratiyon main nahin miltaa he usamen kainvas ko 'vyas' or vashishtha kaha gaya he, jabaki 'raso' ke samast roopon main uske karnati daasi ke saath anuchit prem kii katha di gai he, jisase prakat he ki yah chand mul rachayita uparyukt aadharbhoot prabandhlekhak ko praapt thi, vah prakshipt tha; rachana kaa mul rup uske bhi purv kaa hona chahie
 If the above projected form of the composition is to be about 50 years after its original form, the original ancestral collections would have been prepared about 25 years after that and the copies received were about twenty five years after the preparation of both the above collections
 If it is original poetry no
 Around 1400 can be considered
 samay ke is anumaan main kahin par udaartaa nahin barti gai he, isaliye mul rachana kii tithi iske bahut baad nahin tal sakati he
 The form of the language of composition is found in the examples of arrangements and in the copies of the shortest forms of composition, it is also no
 Around 1400 is known, so the evidence of language also confirms the above result
 'prithvirajraso' vir ras kaa hindi kaa sarvshereshth kavy he
 a vivid imagination of heroic characters in Hindi literature was never seen later in this poem
 pathak rachana bhar main utsaah kii ek umadti hui sarita main bahata chalata he
 The pictures of Anurag and Viraha of Sanyogita before the Kannauj war and the union of Prithviraj Sankhyarita of the said war and the paintings of Kelli Vilas are very attractive
 anya rason kaa bhi kavy main abhaav nahin he
 The description of the composition is extraordinary; The narrator's description of the heroine's mating time provides beautiful examples of synthetic nature painting somewhere
 bhashastyli sarvatra prabhaavapurn he or varnya vishay ke anuroop kavy bhar main badalati rahati he
 If we look at all these qualities of the composition, then it is a beautiful epic and it is undoubtedly a typical work of the modern era of modern Indian Aryabha literature
