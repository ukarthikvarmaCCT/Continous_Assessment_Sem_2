 Kavyanushasana distinguished him in the category of poets of high order

 There are three main parts of Kavyanushasana - sutra, interpretation and sodhasana vritti
 sutro kii vyakhya karne vaali vyakhya 'alankarchudamani' naam prachlit he
 And to clarify, a version called 'vivek' was written

 807 examples are presented in 'alankarchudamani' and 825 examples are presented in 'vivek'

 Hemachandra is his independent opinion about originality
 hemchandra matse koi bhi granthkaar nayi cheez nahin likhata
 Although Mammatka is very much similar to Hemavandraka 'kavyanushasana' with 'kaviprakash'
 paryaapt sthanon par hemachandracharyane mammatka virodh kiya he
 According to Hemachandracharya, Anand, Yash and Kantulya preaching can only be poetic purposes and according to Hemachandra, according to Hemachandra, meaning, gain, knowledge and negative retirement are not poetic purposes
 'kavyanushasan se kavyashasre ke pathakon kon samajane main sulabhta, sugamawa hoti he
 Mammatka 'kaviprakash' is elaborate, well organized, not accessible
 aganit tikaaen hone par bhi mammatka 'kavyprakash' durgam rah jaataa he
 In 'kavyanushasan' this inaccessibility has been facilitated by 'alankarchudamani' and 'vivek'
 'kavyanushasan' main spasht likhte hai ki ve apana mat nirdhaaran abhinavgupt evam bharat ke aadhaar par kar rahe hai
 In fact, Hemachandra, presenting the quotation of other texts, is fundamental from his own independent opinion, style, approach
 granth evam granthkaaron ke naam se sanskrit-sahitya, itihaas par prakaash padataa he
 The best textbook for all levels of readers

 avaiyaktik pyaar saamaanya pyaar jaisaa nahin he, ye insaan ke aatma kaa nazariyaa he jisase dusron ke prati ek shaanti-purvak maansik ravaiya utpann hota he jo dayaa, sanyam, maafee or anukanpa aadi bhavanaaon se vyakt kiya jaataa he
 If it is said in a simple sentence, impersonal love is said to be the behavior of a person towards others
 isiliye, avaiyaktik pyaar ek vastu ke prati insaan ke soch ke upar aadhaarit hota he
 The love between human beings is called mutual love
 ye sirf ek duusare ke liye chaah nahin he balki ek shaktishaalee bhav he

 aisa pyaar parivaar ke sadasyon, doston or premiyon ke bich paaya jaataa hai

 Psychology refers to cognitive and social phenomena
 manovigyaani robert sternberg ne pyaar ke tribhujaakar siddhant ko sutarabaddh kiya hai
 He argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion
 atmiyata wo tatv he jisamen do manushya apane aatmavishvaas or apane zindagi ke vyaktigat vivaran ko baantate hai
 It is mostly seen in friendship and romantic work
 patibaddhta ek ummid he ki ye rishta hameshaa ke liye kaayam rahegaa
 Finally there is sexual attraction and passion

 Romantic love involves both intimacy and passion
 saathi ke pyaar main atmiyata or patibaddhta shaamil hota hai
 Wise love includes commitment and passion
 akhir main, ghaagh pyaar main teenon shaamil hote hai
 Evolutionary psychology has given many reasons to prove love to be a major means of survival
 inke hisaab se manushya apane jeevankaal main abhibhavakiy sahaayta par anya stanpayiyon se zyaada nirbhar rahete hai, pyaar ko is vajah se abhibhavakeey sahare ko prachaar karne kaa tantra bhi mana gaya hai
 It can also be because love can lead to sexually transmitted diseases, which can affect the fertility of humans, can cause injury to the fetus, may also cause complications while producing children
 ye sab chijen jaanane ke baad samaaj main bahuvivaah kii paddati ruk sakati hai
 Azad Pyaar describes a social movement that does not observe a sacred bond like marriage

 Very pure gallium metal has a silver color and its solid metal dissolved conchoidally like glass
 gallium taral jab yah solidifies 3

 Gallium shares the high-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that include water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium
 gallium hamalon dhaatu jaali main diffusing se adhikansh anya dhaatuon
 For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminum, zinc alloys and steel, making them very brittle
 gallium aasaani se kai dhaatuon ke saath mishra dhaatu, or plutonium crystal sanrachana ko sthir karne ke liye parmaanu bam kii plutonium kor main plutonium gallium mishra dhaatu main kam maatra main prayog kiya jaataa he
 The melting point of gallium, at 302

 Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal wets glass and skin, along with most other materials, making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is significantly less toxic and requires far less precautions

 The physical properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, together with the three major crystallographical axes A, B, and C, creating a significant difference between the linear and volume thermal expansion coefficients that do not have distinct values
 gallium ke gunon ko vishesh rup se pighalane bindu ke paas, dridhtaa se taapmaana par nirbhar kar rahe hai
 For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several hundred percent upon melting
 rasinic gunayah bhi dekhen: shrenee: gallium yogicon
 Gallium is mainly found in the 3 oxidation state
