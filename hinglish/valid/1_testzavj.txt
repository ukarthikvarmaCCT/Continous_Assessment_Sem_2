 Also, the status of the poor in society, the honor of virtues, the gratification of the harmony of equal friendship, the gratitude of the obliged class, the anger at the punishment for the innocent, the tyranny of the Raj Vallabh, the prosperity and generosity of Varnari, the sacrifice on the altar of love , Personal subjects such as the ideal character of the Kulanganas have also been highlighted

 Ujjayini is the center of the story of 'mritchkatik'
 vah itnaa bada nagar he ki patliputra kaa samvahak uski prasiddhi sunakar basane ko, dhandha praapt karne ko, aata he
 We find a society of Chaturvarnya in it - Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras
 brahmanon kaa mukhya kaam purohitai tha, par ve rajkaaj main bhi dilchaspee lete the
 a very serious thing which is found in this story is that here Brahmins, merchants and inferior people together overthrow the Madanand Kshatriya kingdom
 yah dhyaan dene yogya baat he
 And then it is a matter of thinking that the author of this story is considered to be King Shudraka, who is said to be superior among the Kshatriyas
 mrichctic main das ank hai, prayek ank main kai drushya hai
 The play has the story of a true but poor Brahmin Charudatta who is loved by Vasundasena, a beauty queen
 isi ke saath aryak kii rajyaprapti kii raajnneetik katha bhi gunthi hui he
 Kritikar has skillfully combined the two stories
 yah naatak mote taur par do hisson main hai- pehla, vasantsena or charudatt kaa prem-prasang tathaa doosraa, rajya vidroh ke saath aryak ko rajpad kii prapti
 First issue: There is a story in this issue that the king's brother-in-law wants to get Vasantasena, the famous courtesan of Ujjayini
 apane do saathiyon ke saath ek andheri raat main vah vasantsena kaa peechha karata he
 The terrified Vasantasena takes Sharan at Charudatta's house
 choron se bachane kii baat kahkar vah apane saare swarna-aabhushan charudatt ke ghar main dharohar ke rup main chhod detii he
 Number two: The conductor, who was previously in the service of Charudatta, loses a lot of money due to gambling addiction
 bachaav ke liye vah vasantsena ke ghar shaaran letaa he, jo apana kangan dekar use rinmukt karti he
 He becomes a Buddhist-monk
 teesraa ank : sharvilak naam kaa brahman vasantsena kii daasi madnika se prem karata he
 To free him from slavery, he breaks into Charudatta's house one night and steals all the gold jewelery kept by Vasantasena
 udhar charudatt kii pativrata patni dhoota apane pati ko lokaninda se bachaane ke liye, churaae gaye aabhushaanon ke badale main apni keemtee ratnavali detii he, charudatt vah ratnavali dekar vidooshak maitrey ko vasantsena ke ghar bhejtaa he
 Fourth issue: Sharvilak arrives at Vasantasena's house to take Madanika free from slavery by taking stolen stolen clothes
 chori kii baat sunakar madnika bahut dukhi hoti he
 In the spirit of correcting this mistake, she convinces Sharvilak that by handing over stolen robes to Vasantasena, he will not remain a thief, nor will there be a loan on the head of Charudutt and he will get Vasantasena's jewelery back, Sharvilak does so
 vah vasantsena se kahata he ki charudatt ne yah sandesh bheja he ki ghar jarjar hone se ham swarnapaatr ko surakshit nahin rakh sakate, atah aap ise apane paas rakhen
 Vasantasena hands Madanika to Sharvilak, asking him to take something in exchange for the message
 isi ank main vidooshak vasantsena se milakar kahata he ki swarnapaatr jue main haar gaye hai isliye yah ratnavali sweekaar karen
 Vasantasena knows the reality, but does nothing
 vah shaam ko charudatt ke ghar aane kaa nishchay karti he
 Fifth issue: This season describes the rainy season
 vasantsena charudatt se milti he or varsha kii jhadi ke kaaran raat usee ke ghar ruk jaati he
 Sixth Point: In the morning, Charudatta goes for a walk in the Pushparkandak garden, with the promise of keeping the car ready for Vasantasena so that he can travel to the park there
 yaheen vasantsena charudatt ke putr rohsen ko yah jid karte dekhati he ki vah mitti kii gaadi se nahin swarna-shakatic se khelnaa chahta he
 Vasantasena puts all the clothes in a clay cart and says that to make a gold car from it
 vasantsena charudatt se udyaan main bhent karne nikalati he, par bhul se usee sthaan par khadi shaakaar kii gaadi main baith jaati he
 Meanwhile, Gawale's son Aryak, who breaks the prison and runs out after killing the guard, gets into Chaudutt's vehicle for rescue
 raste main do police ke sipaahi- virak or chandanak vaahan dekhte bhi hai, par unamem se ek aryak ko raksha karne kaa vachan dekar jane detaa he
 Seventh issue: Aryak named Aryak, who believed that King Palak believed in the prophecy of the Siddhas, was imprisoned when he broke the bond and climbed into the car of Charudatta and came in front of Chaudatta in the garden and asked for his protection
 charudatt use surakshit apni gaadi main baahar nikalava detaa he
 Eighth issue: When Vasantasena, who was sitting in a carriage of Shakara by mistake, reaches the garden, he is confronted by the evil Shakar in place of Charudatta
 vasantsena ek baar phir shaakaar ke changul main fas jaati he, shaakaar kaa aagrah na maanane par vah vasantsena kaa galaa ghont detaa he or use mara jaanakar patton se dhak kar chalaa jaataa he
 That is why the conductor, who has become a Buddhist-monk from the gambler, brings life back to Vasantasena, the deceased
 navaan ank : shaakaar charudatt ko vasantsena kii hatya kaa aaropee banaata he
 Controversy goes on in court, Charudatta is unable to prove himself innocent
 dukhi charudatt apane mitra maitrey kii pratiksha karata he, jo vasantsena ke paas un aabhushanon ko lautaane gaya tha jo vasantsena ne rohsen kii mitti kii gaadi ke sthaan par sone kii gaadi bana lene ko de die the
 Maitreya arrives at the same moment with the same ornament
 kintu baatcheet karte hue maitrey se bagal main sanbhale hue ve aabhushan sabake saamne gir padate hai or yah maan liya jaataa he ki aabhushanon ke lobh main charudatt ne hi vasantsena kii hatya kii he
 He is ordered to death and taken to the slaughter
 dasavaan ank : is ank main ek to shaakaar kaa sevak sthvarak charudatt ko nirdosh bataata he, par uskaa koi vishwaas nahin karata
 At the same time, Vasantasena expresses the wickedness of Shakara by coming with a vampire who has become a Buddhist-monk who saves his life and Charudatta is freed from false accusation
 idhar rajya main nae raja aryak kaa aagaman hota he, vah na keval aarope mukt charudatt ko rajya detaa he, balki jhootha aarope lagane ke kaaran shaakaar ko mrityu-dand bhi detaa he
 But Shakar is also forgiven at the behest of Charudatta
 pativrata dhoota charudatt ke liye mrityu-dand kaa samachar sunakar agni-pravesh ko tatpar ho uthati he, charudatt upasthit hokar is dukhad ghatana ko roktaa he
 King Aryak pleases Vasantasena with the title of 'bride'
 bhikshu samvahak ko sab viharon kaa kulapati bana diya jaataa he
 The slave settler is freed from slavery, the chanters who give death penalty are made the chiefs of the chandalas, even the shakaras are given tribute
 in sukhad ghatnaon ke saath naatak samaapt hota he
 Not only is the story of Mruthaktik very interesting, but the character of the poet's characterization is very high
 yadhyapi isamen pradhan ras vipralambh shringaar he tathaapi hasya, karuna, bhayanak evam vatsalya jaise hridayahari vividh rason kaa sahaj saamanjasy he
 Its value has also been judged very much by Western mystics when tested from the point of view of Greek theater
 isaki bhashaa prasad gun se sampann ho atyant pranjal he
 The philosophy of the various forms of Prakrit is seen in it- In addition to Oriya, Magadhi and Shaurseni, the best examples of Prakrit Maharashtri and Avanti are available here
 grearsan ke anusaar is prakaran main shaakaari vibhaasha main takki praakrit kaa bhi prayog paaya jaataa he
 The poet has given special attention to Madhuri and Arthayavakthi in Shabchayan, due to which the Avanti and Vaidarbhi customs have been completely fulfilled
 mrichctic main do kathaayen hai
 One is Chauduttatta, the other is Aryak
 gunanty kii brihatkatha main gopal darak aryak ke vidroh kii katha he
 Brihatkha was written in its original form in the Paischi language under the name of 'baddakha'
 isse prakat hota he ki yah naatak isvi pehali shatee yaa duusari shatee kaa he
 This drama holds its special place in Sanskrit literature
 isamen– These are its characteristics
 is naatak kii raajnneetik visheshta yah he ki isamen kshatriya raja bura bataaya gaya he
 Gopatra 'aryak' is a cowherd, whom the poet makes a king
 yadhyapi kavi varnashram ko maanata he, par vah gop ko hi raja banaata he
 It seems that this story is old and possibly this incident is some real event which has remained in the legend
 daspratha ke ladkadhaate samaaj kaa chithran bahut sundar hua he or yah hamen chanakya ke samay main miltaa he, jab ‘arya’ shabd ‘naagarik’ ke rup main prayukt miltaa he
 Some old legend may have descended into this legend in the later period of Chanakya
 buddha ke samay main vyapaariyon kaa utkarsh bhi kaaphi hua tha
 Then Ujjayini's kingdom was different, Kosala's separate
 yahan bhi ujjayini kaa varnan he
 At one point it seems that there was a feeling of unity of India even when it is said that 'aryak has conquered the whole earth' - the earth whose Kailas flag is
 dekha jaae to kavi yathartwaadee tha or nishpaksh tha
 He has shown the good and evils of all and has depicted it very deeply
 yahi uski safalataa kaa kaaran he
 It is considered to be the work of Maharaja Shudraka who, like Bhasa and Kalidas, has become a king poet
 mrichctic isvi pratham shatee ke lagbhag kii rachana kahi ja sakati he
 It is said that Bhasparnit 'charudatta' has been modified by adding a story of a Chaturangi metaphor by a later Shudra poet
 vastut: isaki kathavstu kaa aadhaar brihatkatha or kathasaritsagar main varnit kathaon main miltaa he
 Ujjayini is the center of the story of 'mritchkatik'
 vah itnaa bada nagar he ki patliputra kaa samvahak uski prasiddhi sunakar basane ko, dhandha praapt karne ko, aata he
 At that time he does not call Pataliputra a metropolis
 iskaa matlab he ki us samay patliputra se adhik mahatv ujjayini kaa tha
 Apparently Pataliputra was Pataliputra in Buddha's time, while Mahasen Chand at Ujjayini was a prosperous kingdom of Pradyot
 duusari pracheenta he ki isamen das pratha bahut he
 The slave-maids were freed by giving money
 us samaaj main ganika bhi vadhoo ban jaati thi
 All these things belong to a society where there is no strictness, which started later
 balki kavi ne ganika ko vadhoo banaakar samaaj main ek nayaa adarsh rakhaa he
 There is a sense of rebellion in him
 atyaachaari ko vah pashu kii tarah maravaata he, stri ko unchaa uthaata tathaa das sthaavarak ko azaad karata he
 It can be said that this drama, which is an episode in classical terms - is very important

 Tripathi has been a serious researcher of both language and literature
 unki pehali pustak 'hindi aalochana' aaj bhi apni moulikta, pranjalata, eemaandaar abhivyakti tathaa sateek evam vyapak vishleshan ke kaaran apane kshetra main adwitiya he
 Tripathi ji has not written much, but reading what he has written, it can be said that every line written by him is very important and important
 treepathi ji ne tulsidas tathaa mira ke kavy par ek-ek pustak likhi hai
 With reference to Tulsidas from Acharya Shukla to Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma ji, finding something new and meaningful is definitely a big challenge, which Tripathi has done well
 kavi tulsi kaa jo rup inaki pustak ke prakashit ho jane ke baad bana, vah pehle nahin ban paaya tha
 And how authentic and heart-rending this form is, its reflection is very well reflected by Rajendra Yadav's letter written on this book
 purv ke saare tarkon ke baavjood tulsidas ko andhvishwasi, rudhivaadee, aparivartankami aadi tathaa ram ke charitra ko paramparaposhak evam gilgile maanane vaale rajendra yadav jaise vyakti ko bhi yah pustak padhate hue laga ki pustak main ek aisi ajeeb-si ooshmaa, atmiyata or band lene vaali nishchhalata he ki main ise padhata hi chalaa gaya
 The good thing is that neither you crowned Rama nor planted the sandalwood to Tulsi - you have lived your Awadh through Tulsi, the people there, their mutual relations and references - without glorifying them - Is engraved sab kuch aapane itnaa maanviya or spandansheel bana diya he ki main tulsi ke prati apane saare purvagrah chhodkar padhata chalaa gaya xxrep 4 
 In the three chapters of 'meera Ka Kavya', the author has made reference to the relationship between 'meera' and her 'girdhar Nagar' in a multi-faceted perspective of the Varna system, women and devotional movement - in a highly taboo society - through the expression of status quo and The significance of the poeticity of the dialecticality of social motion, cannot be underlined by calling it 'anupam'
 use to bas padhakar hi janaa ja saktaa he
 No extra courage is needed to read more
 bas shuru kar dena he
 Then, Tripathi ji's capable but effortless transparent language-style goes on in its natural way of clean clean
 treepathi ji kaa adhikansh lekhan apane samay or samaaj se judaa hua lekhan he
 Whether it is a discussion of Parsai's satirical essays or the inauguration of the poems of Kedarnath Agarwal's poems; Be it both books that touch the highest frontier of story-criticism centered on the story or the multidimensional-multicolored world of memoir-biography - Tripathi ji's goal is often to identify every point of divergence, avoid it and escape or escape the target authors By understanding the process of trying, it is the precise identity of the complete vision that can move the society in the right direction at the right speed
 is sabake liye treepathi ji ne na to polymix kaa sahaara liya he, na hi kisi gutbandi ko sweekaar kiya he
 Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, while being a resident and beloved of his, remained constantly warmly connected to Ram Vilas Sharma, who was fiercely opposed to certain issues - due to his immense potential, and epoch-making works; And while revealing continued respect for Sharma ji, Namvar ji, who did not miss any opportunity to oppose him, was always heartless due to his indomitable curiosities for multifaceted versatility, accurate identification of literature and 'mobile university form' of criticism

 Thus, the purpose of creating two texts was to propagate the elements of another Jainism and on the other hand to attract people to their religion by presenting a copy of popular Sanskrit epics in Kannada
 ye jain kavi sanskrit, praakrit tathaa apbhransh bhashaaon ke vidvan the, sahityashastra ke marmajna the or pratibhasampann kavi bhi
 These poets, with the necessary changes, made the mythological narratives compatible with their religion, but maintained their interestingness by not destroying their originality
 jain kaviyon kii rachanaaon se kannada bhashaa or sahitya kaa bada upkaar hua
 During this period, there was a special promotion of Champu poetry
 is samay ke dharmik kaavyon main adbhoot tathaa shant or loukik kaavyon main vir tathaa raudra rason kii vishesh rup se abhivyanjana hui
 In addition to the above two types of poetry, texts were written on various topics like verses, rasa, ornament, grammar, dictionary, astrology, vaidyak etc
 is prakaar is yug main kannada sahitya kii sarvatomukhi unnati hui
 There were three famous poets of this era - Pampa, Ponn and Ranna who are famous as "rannatrayi"
 mahakavi pump athwa aadi pump ne do kavy rache–"adipurana" or "vikramarjunvijay" athwa "panpabharat"
 The Adipuran depicts the biography of the first Tirthankara Vrishabhanatha based on the Jinasenacharized Sanskrit Purana and the "vikramarajunvijay" depicts the plot of the Mahabharata
 ye donon champookavy hai
 The pumps are considered to be the original poets of Kannada
 inkaa samay san 941 ke lagbhag mana jaataa he
 Ponn was a contemporary of Pampa
 unhone teen granth rache the–"shantipurana", "jinaksharmala" tathaa "bhuvanakaramabhyuday"
 The last book is not available
 rann kii mukhya rachanaayen do hai– "ajitpurana" tathaa "saahas bhimavijay" athwa "gadayuddh"
 The hero of Gadayudh is Bhima
 gadayuddh main viraras kii anuthi vyanjana hui he
 With this poetry, Ranna's fame has become immovable
 pump yug ke anya kaviyon main choundary, nagvarm, durgasingh, chandraraj, nagachandra, nagvarm aadi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Chaundarai's "chaundarayuparan" is a beautiful specimen of ancient Kannada prose
 nagvarm pratham ke do granth praapt hue hai– "karnataka kandabari" tathaa "chhandombudhi"
 "karnatakakadambari" is the Kannada model of Kadambari of Baan
 yah champu style main he
 Prof
 Mughali is of the opinion that Kannada has the best of the translated texts in the Carnatic Kadambari of Nagavarma - Chandraraj and Sridharacharya are contemporary poets of Nagavarma
 chandraraj kaa kaamshaastra par likhaa hua "madanatilak" naamak granth or shridharacharya kaa "jatakatilak" naamak jyotish granth, donon uttam kritiyaan hai
 It was during this period that Durgasingh, who was a poet of the Bhagavata sect, introduced the Sanskrit "panchatantra"
 11veen or 12veen shatabdiyon ke bich ek anya prasiddh kavi hue, jinka naam nagachandra tha
 As he composed the Ramayana after getting inspiration from Pamparabharata, he got another name "abhinav Pampa"
 nagachandra ne bhi purvavarti jain kaviyon kii bhanti do kavy rache–"mallinathpurana" tathaa "ramchandracharitpurana" athwa "panparamayana"
 Pamparamayan is the oldest of the available Ramakatha poems of Kannada
 panpyug main mahakaviyon kaa aavirbhaav hua or unhone apni mahaan kritiyon se kannada ko samrudh banaaya
 Although large artistic adult poems were produced in this period, literature was not in contact with the lives of ordinary people of the society
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah tha ki is samay ke kavi raajaaon ke aashray main rahete the or ve jo kuch likhte the, yaa to apane ashrayadata raajaaon kaa yash gane ke liye likhte the yaa darbar ke anya panditon ke bich vaahvahee lutane ke liye athwa apane dharm kaa prachaar karne ke liye
 As a result, the colloquial language was not considered suitable for the literature surgeon
 sarvatra sanskrit kaa prabhaav padaa
 The adult poems composed in the Champu style were limited to the pundits, not the object of the general public
 12 veen shatabdi ke uttarardh se 15veen shatabdi tak kaa kaal basav yug kehalaata he
 The second name of this era is "revolution"
 is samay karnataka main dharmik, saamaajik yaa raajnneetik, aisa koi kshetra nahin tha jo kranti se achoota rah sakaa ho
 The revolutionaries of this revolution were Basava, Basavan or Basaveshwara, hence the name of this era was Basava era
 is kaal main sanskritnishtha kannada ke sthaan par bolchaal kii kannada sahitya ke nirmaan ke liye uparyukt samajhi gai or sanskrit kii kavyastylee ke badale deshi chhandon ko vishesh protsaahan diya gaya
 In the last centuries, the Jain fraternities had all rights in the literary field
 is yug main bhinn-bhinn mataavalambiyon ne sahitya ke nirmaan main yoga diya
 Devotion became a strong driving force in the growth of literature
 12veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main basaweshwar kaa aavirbhaav hua
 He created a great upheaval in the religious and social life of Karnataka by the re-organization of the Veerashaivism
 basav tathaa unke anuyaayiyon ne apane mat ke prachaar ke liye bolchaal kii kannada ko madhyam banaaya
 The Veerashaiva devotees recounted their experiences in devotion, knowledge, quietness, virtue and policy in the style of niradambara, which became popular in the name of prabandh literature
 in virshaiv bhakton athwa shivasharanon ke vachan ek prakaar ke gadhygit hai
 Shiva Sharan did not create literature for literature
 unka mukhya uddeshy apane vichaaron kaa prachaar karnaa hi tha
 He had simplicity in his thoughts, truth and a sense of genuine curiosity
 isliye unki vaani main saahitiyik saushthav apane aap aa gaya
 The words of these Shiva Sharanas did the same thing in Karnataka that Kabir and his followers did in North India
 basav ne bhakthi kaa upadesh diya or is bhakthi kii sadhana main vaidic karmkand, murtipuja, jati panti kaa bhedbhaav, avatharavaad, andhashraddha aadi ko baadhak tehraaya
 He sought to make the path of spiritual means universal by building a casteless, colorless, classless society
 basav ke samakaleen virshaiv bhakton main allamprabhu, akkamahadevi, chenn-bansav tathaa siddharam pramukh hai
 In addition to these utterances Shiva Sharan, there were many such poets who presented poetic texts of devotional form using native verses
 12veen or 13veen shatabdiyon ke bich teen shreshth kavi hue harihar, raghavank or padmaras
 Names of Chandra, Bandhuvarma, Jann, Mallikarjuna, Keshiraj, Rattakavi and Kumudendu Muni are notable among the Jain poets of this period
 13veen shatabdi main karnataka kii dharmik sthiti main phir se uthal puthal hui
 On the one hand, Karnataka was influenced by the Srivaishnava sect founded by Ramanujacharya and on the other hand there was a new wave of devotion to Madhvacharya's dualism
 in donon vaishnav sampradaayon dwaara chalaai gai bhaktidhaara se kannada sahitya main nutan shakti kaa sanchaar hua
 As a result, the narratives of mythological epics were represented in Kannada in a purely original form
 is avadhi main rudrabhatt naamak ek vaishnav kavi hue jinka "jagannathavijay" kannada kaa sarvapratham vaishnav prabandh kavy mana jaataa he
 It is written in the Champu style and its narrative is related to Krishna
 15veen shatabdi se 19veen shtabdi ke ant tak kaa kaal kumarvyas yug kehalaata he
 During this period, the emperors of Vijayanagar and the kings of Mysore shared a special hand in the growth of Kannada literature
 vaishnav dharm kii pratishtha badi jisaki pratikriya kannada sahitya main bhi dikhaai padi
 Bhakti propagated by Vaishnava religion appeared as a driving force in literature
 sahitya janata ke ati nikat sampark main aayaa
 The best poet of this period is Narnapp who became famous due to his popularity with the designation of "kumaravayas"
 kumarvyas bhagwat sampradaay ke pramukh kavi the
 There are differences among scholars regarding the birth date, birthplace of Narnapp or Kumaravyas and their creation
 pro mughali ke anusaar 14veen or 15veen shatabdiyon ke bich kumarvyas jivit the
 Kumaravyas is said to have written two poems called "kannada Bharat" or "gadugin Bharat" and "airavat"
 lekin airavat ke unki kriti hone main andeh prakat kiya gaya he
 "kannada India" depicts the story of the first ten festivals of the diffused Mahabharata
 yadhyapi pump ne apane "panpabharat" dwaara mahabharat kii sari katha kaa kannada praturup prastut kiya tha to bhi vah kumarvyas ke kannadabharat kii tarah lokapriy nahin ho sakaa
 There are two reasons for this - one is that there was a tendency towards pandityapradarshan in Pamparabharata and secondly that Jainism was also colored in it
 kumarvyas ke kannadabharat ke uparaant mahabharat, ramayana or bhagwat ke kathankon ke aadhaar par bahut se uttam kavy shatpadi style main prastut kiye gaye
 Following the path shown by Kumaravayas, a poet named Narhari or Kumaravalmiki composed "torveramayana" in Kannada based on Valmiki Ramayana
 yah bhi bhaktipradhan prabandh kavy hai, jo pracheen kannada kii ek saras kalakriti he
 Among the Bhagwat matavalambi poets, the names of Timman Kavi, Chatu Vitthalnath, Lakshmish and Nagaras are notable
 kumarvyas se prerana paakar timmann kavi ne mahabharat ke antim aath parvo kii katha kaa nirupan "krishnaraj bharat" naamak apane kavy main kiya
 The Kannada padyanuvad of the overall Bhagavata was first presented by a Bhagavata poet named Chatu Vitathalnath
 lagbhag isi kaal main ek atyant pratibhasampann kavi hue jinka naam lakshmish tha
 His written "jaminibharata" is a unique poem in which some interesting episodes of the Mahabharata are described as beautiful and touching
 lokapriyata kii drushti se karnataka main kumarvyas ke bharat ke baad jaiminibharat kaa sthaan he
 The poet named Nagarasa presented the Kannada verse of Bhagavad Gita called "vasudevakathamrutasara"
 jis prakaar is avadhi main kumarvyas, kumaravalmiki, lakshmish jaise bhagwat sampradaay ke kaviyon ne bharat, ramayana, bhagwat aadi mahakavyon se kathavstu lekar kannada main bhaktipradhan prabandh kaavyon kaa pranayan kiya, usee prakaar madhvamtavlambee bhakton ne bolchaal kii kannada main geet, bhajan, kirthan rachakar bhakthi kaa sandesh karnataka ke ghar-ghar pahunchaaya
 The tradition of these devotees began in the 13th century by Narharitirtha
 is samay in bhakton kii ek badi mandali jute gai thi jo pradhanthya do bhaagon main vibhajit thi
 One party was named "vyasakuta" and the other was "daskut"
 in donon main antar yahi tha ki ve bhakt vyasakut ke kehalaate the jo adhikansh brahman the or jo apane vichaaron kii abhivyakti ke liye sanskrit ko hi upyukt samajhate the, evam ve bhakt daskut ke maane jate the jinamein sabhi jatiyon ke log sammilit the or jo kannada ke madhyam se bhajan, kirthan rachate the
 There was no difference between the devotees of "vyasakuta" and "daskut" in the elements of the sect
 in donon dalon ke bhakt karnataka main haridas ke naam se prasiddh hai
 These Haridas filled the stock of Kannada literature by creating thousands of verses in the subjects of devotion, knowledge, virtue, policy, love, public behavior, etc
, but in grammatical Kannada
 haridaason kii parampara 18veen shatee tak chalati he
 The songs of Haridas have had a deep and wide impact on the Kannada people
 in haridaason main purandardaas, kanakadas, jagannathdas aadi pramukh hai
 Some 17th century Vaishnava poets created excellent poems in the 17th century, under the shelter of King Chikdevaraya of Mysore
 in kaviyon main thirumalarya, chikupadhyaay, singrarya, honnamma, helvan katte giriammaa, mahalingrang kavi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 At the same time, for the first time, the influence of the Sri Vaisnava sect was directly visible in Kannada literature
 chikadevaraay "binnap" tathaa "gitagopal" naamak apni rachanaaon main thirumalarya ne shrivaishnav sampradaay ke saath-saath aikantik bhakthi kaa nirupan kiya he
 "hadivadeyadharma" is a beautiful poem of Honnamma in which Satidharma is described in Pranjal language
 mahalingrang kavi ke likhe "anubhavamrutt" main shankar ke advait siddhant kaa saar saras kannada main prastut kiya gaya he
 Chikdevaraya himself was a good poet
 is yug main virshaiv mataavlambee bhakton evam kaviyon ne bhi naanaa prakaar ke granth rachakar kannada kii seva kii
 Some of these centuries are written in style
 vachan style ke atirikt kuch gadhy granth bhi likhe gaye or saangtya, tripadi, vrutt, champu, geet aadi chhandon kaa vishesh prayog kiya gaya
 But the number of pledges in this long period are numbered
 charitkavy prastut karanevaale virshaiv kaviyon main chamras, viroopaksh pandit or shadakshardev agraganya the
 Among the poems written by Chamaras, "prabhulingalele" is the best character
 "prabhulingalile" main allam prabhu ke jeevanavrutt kaa vistaar kiya gaya he
 Among the Veerashaiva poets, Chamaras are named after Harihara with respect for those who composed the best poetry of poetry
 viroopaksh pandit kaa likhaa hua chennabasav puraana bhi uttam prabandh kavy he, jisamen prasiddh virshaiv bhakt chennabasav kii kahani kahi gai he
 Harihara's "basavarajaragale" and Chamaras's "prabhulingalele" have not been able to do as well as "chennabasavapurana", as the beautiful syncretism of poetry and poetry is done
 pump yug main jain kaviyon ne apane shreshth prabandh kaavyon ke dwaara kannada main champustyli ko atyant lokapriy banaaya
 But later this style became less used
 kumarvyas yug main phir se yah style apanaai gai
 The poet who adopted it was not Veerashaiva but Jain
 17veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main shadakshardev naamak ek pratibhasampann virshaiv kavi ne champustyli main teen prabandh kavy rache jinke naam "rajasekharvilas", "shabarshankarvilas", tathaa "vrishabhendravijay" hai
 "rajashekharvilas" and "shabarshankarvilas", narrate stories related to Shivlila
 "vrishabhendravijay" kii kathavstu basav kaa jeevanavrutt he
 This era saw the incarnation of a great Veerashaiva saint
 unka asli naam kya tha, iskaa kuch pataa nahin laga he
 His literary surname was "omniscient"
 inhone "tripadi" naamak chand main apni amrit vaani sunai he
 Each stanza ends with the word "omniscient" and has an independent meaning like the couplets of Hindi
 is avadhi main jain dharm kaa prabhaav lupt ho chalaa tha
 Nevertheless, some Jain poetic poets served Kannada with their power
 jain kaviyon ne prachlit deshi kavyaneleyon main kavyrachana kii
 Among such poets, the names of Bhaskar, Terkanambi, Bommaras, Shishyamayana, Trithayamangaras, Salva Kavi and Ratnakarvarni are notable
 inamen ratnakarvarni sarvshereshth hai, jinaki kritiyon main "bharteshvaibhav" mukhya he
 The description of the bright characters of Bharat and Bahubali, the son of the first Tirthankar Adidev, is the story of "bharateshvaibhav"
 pant, harihar, kumarvyas jaise kannada ke mahakaviyon kii shrenee main ratnakarvarni kaa naam bhi liya jaataa he
 There were some good poets in the last of this era ie in the 19th century
 devchand naamak jain kavi ne "ramakathavatar" likhakar jain ramayana parampara ko aage badhaayaa
 Kempunarayana and Basavappa Shastri among the court poets of King Mummudi Krishnaraja Odier of Mysore created a conducive atmosphere for the production of drama literature in Kannada by presenting translations of some plays in Sanskrit and English
 kalidas ke shakuntal aadi naatakon kaa basavapp shastri ne itani safalataa se anuwaad kiya ki ve "abhinav kalidas" ke naam se prasiddh hue
 Kempunarayan wrote a historical novel titled "mudramanjush"
 nandavansh kii kahani isaki kathavstu he jisapar mudrarakshas kaa prabhaav lakshith hota he
 This is the first novel of Kannada
 19veen shatabdi ke ant main muddan naamak ek safal kavi hue jinhone teen saras kavy likhe : "adbhut ramayana", "rampattabhishek" or "ramashwamedh"
 "awesome Ramayana" and "ramashvamedha" are both prose texts
 inke gadhy kii yah visheshta he ki pracheen kannada kii praudhata evam madhurata ke saath-saath aadhunik kannada kii saralata kaa parichay miltaa he
 The late 19th century is very important in the history of Indian life
 chunki is samay samaan paristhitiyon tathaa prabhaavon se sara bhartiya jivan mathit tathaa andolit hua tha, at: yah kaha ja saktaa he ki aadhunik kannada sahitya kii gatividhi kii kahani anya pradeshik bhashaaon ke sahitya kii kahani se kuch bhinn nahin hai
 Modern Kannada literature can be divided into four main parts which are as follows: aadhunik kannada kaa pratham utthan gadhy ke saath prarambh hota he jiske nirmaan main isai mishnariyon kii seva ullekhneey he
 In 1809, the Reverend William Carey is said to have presented a translation of the Bible
 lagbhag 1831 main balneri tathaa mangalore main mishnariyon dwaara mudranalay sthapit kiye gaye jinke kaaran kannada granthon kii chapai main sahaayta mili
 Kannada Bible, published in 1823, is the first prose book of modern Kannada
 taduparant isai padariyon ne apane dharm ke prachaar ke hetu kannada main patrapatrikas prakashit karai jinamein "sabhaptr", "satyadipike", tathaa "karnataka" mukhya hai
 In the last three decades of the 19th century important work was done for the promotion of Kannada language and literature
 idhar dakshin karnataka main karnataka ke raajaaon ke protsaahan ke falswaroop karnataka main praachya pustkaalay tathaa udhar dharwar main karnataka vidyavardhak sangh kii sthapana hui
 The work of collecting, editing and publishing ancient inscriptions and manuscripts started on behalf of these two institutions

 narsinhachaar ne anathak praytn karke "di epigraphia karnatika" kaa baarah bhaagon main prakaashan karaayaa
 Rice edited an ancient grammatical treatise called "shantanushasan" of Bhattakunk and in his preface the outline of the history of Kannada literature was presented for the first time in English
 mangalore ke basel mishan ke tatwadhan main reverend eff
 kittal naamak ek german padri ne 18 varsh nirantar parishram karke kannada panditon ke sahyog se "kannada angreji brihatkosh" prakashit karaayaa, saath hi kannada ke pracheen granthon kaa sangrah evam sampadan kaary prarambh kiya
 In the same period text books were published by the University of Madras at Fort St
 College for the purpose of teaching Kannada
 is prakaar yadhyapi kannada bhashaa tathaa sahitya ke punaruddhar ke liye stuty udyog hua, to bhi skool kalejon main shiksha kaa madhyam angreji hone ke kaaran kannada ke prati janata main jaisaa aadar hona chahie tha vaisaa nahin utpann hua
 The period from 1900 to 1921 AD is a period of more definite and varied achievements
 pehali baar or
 narhinsaachaar ne san 1907 main kannada sahitya kaa ek brihat itihaas "karnataka kavicharite" teen bhaagon main prakashit kiya jisamen ek sahasr varsho ke kannada ke samast kaviyon tathaa unki kritiyon kaa pramanik itivrutt prastut ho gaya
 Although it cannot be said that poets and poetry have been evaluated in this history on the basis of modern criticism method, yet it is certain that a definite cornerstone by the "carnatic Kavichritte" for the study, teaching and research work of Kannada literature
 Was submitted san 1915 main i

 rice ne angreji main history ov canaries litarechar likhakar paashchaatya drushtikon se kannada saahatya ke adhyayan kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Thus in the first rise, Rice's publication of "the Epigraphia Carnatica" began the historical study of literature from a modern perspective and the creation of the "carnatic Poetry of Narcissism" set a definite backdrop for the critical study of the lives and works of Kannada writers
 Hui

 In the shelter of these two institutions, a new environment was presented for the promotion of Kannada language and literature

 At the same time, Khasi circles of poets were established in various parts of Karnataka, expressing the love of the earth and the full spirit of nationalism
 pragatha, visapika, geetikavy, sonet geet or bhajan, varnanaatmak kavita, khandakavy, virakavy, romance, darshanik kavita, gadhygit or swaagatbhaashan–ye or anya kavyavibhag utkrisht anand or ucch prerana se viksit hue
 Kuvenpu and Ambikatanayadatta can be called the best among the poets of this group in terms of depth, generality and magnitude of works

 Primarily Bendre has composed the song
 "gari", "sakhigit", "nadalile", "arul marul" unke geetsangrahon main mukhya hai
 The progressive movement which originated in 1930 had a profound impact on the literature of this time
 kavita ke kshetra main bhi nai shakti kaa sanchaar hua
 New verses and new compositions were established
 aadhunik kannada sahitya main choti kahani sabase adhik lokapriy he
 Maasti Venkatesh Iyengar is considered the father of modern Kannada story literature
 unki kahaniyon main darshaniktaa, deshbhakti, aitihaasikta, gramin jivan ke chitra, manovaigyanik vishleshan, paariwarik chithran aadi tatwon kaa bada hi sundar samavesh hua he
 From the point of view of the object and craft of the story, the development of Kannada story clearly shows this time

 Just as the original forms of Hindi drama literature and theater are found in the form of Ramlila, Krishnalila, Rasdhari mandalis, the original form of drama and theater of Kannada is found in the form of "yakshagana", "bayalat", "tammadale"
 yakshagan ke liye likhe gaye naatak praaia: padya main paae jate hai
 Singararya's "mitravinda Govind", written in 1680 under the ancient literature of Kannada, is considered the first drama of Kannada

 Siddhivinayak is the most popular form of Ganesha
 ganesh ji jin pratimaaon kii sud dayee tarah mudi hoti he, ve sidghpeeth se judi hoti hai or unke mandir sidghivinayak mandir kehalaate hai
 It is said that the glory of Siddhi Vinayak is incomparable, he fulfills the wishes of the devotees immediately
 manyata he ki aise ganpati bahut hi jaldi prasann hote hai or utani hi jaldi kupit bhi hote hai
 The second feature of Siddhi Vinayak is that he is a quadrilateral deity
 unke upree daaen haath main camel or baayen haath main ankush he or neeche ke daahine haath main motiyon kii maala or baayen haath main modak bharaa katoraa he
 Both his wives Riddhi and Siddhi are present on both sides of Ganapati which signifies wealth, opulence, success and fulfillment of all desires
 mastak par apane pita shiv ke samaan ek teesraa netra or gale main ek sarp haar ke sthaan par lipta he
 The Deity of Siddhi Vinayak is two and a half feet high and it is made of the same black stone, two feet wide
 yun to sidghivinayak ke bhakt duniya ke har kone main hai lekin maharashtra main inke bhakt sabase zyada hai
 The Siddhivinayak Temple in the Prabha Devi area of mumbai, a city of prosperity, is one of those Ganesh temples, where not only Hindus, but people of all religions come for darshan and worship
 haalanki is mandir kii na to maharashtra ke 'ashtavinayakon ’ main ginati hoti he or na hi 'siddh tech ’ se iskaa koi sambandh he, phir bhi yahaan ganpati puja kaa khaas mahatv he
 Ganapathi of Siddha Tek in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra is also known as Siddhivinayak and is counted among the Ashtavinayakas
 maharashtra main ganesh darshan ke aath siddh aitihaasik or puranic sthal hai, jo ashtavinayak ke naam se prasiddh hai
 But despite being different from the Ashtavinayaks, its importance is not less than a proven back
 aamtaur par bhaktagan bain taraf mudi sud vaali ganesh pratimaa kii hi pratishthapana or puja-archana kiya karte hai
 That is to say, the Ganesha idols curved on the right side are of the Siddha Peeth and the statue of Ganesha in the Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai is curved in the right
 yani yah mandir bhi siddh peeth he
 Legend has it that this temple was built in Samvat 1692
 magar sarkari dastavejon ke mutabik is mandir kaa 19 november 1801 main pehali baar nirmaan hua tha
 This first temple of Siddhi Vinayak was very small
 pichley do dashakon main is mandir kaa kai baar punarnirmaan ho chukaa he
 As recently as a decade ago in 1991, the Maharashtra government provided land of 20,000 square feet for the grand construction of this temple
 vartmaan main siddhi vinayak mandir kii imaarat paanch manjila he or yahaan pravachan grah, ganesh sangrahalay va ganesh vipith ke alaava duusari manzil par aspataal bhi he, jahaan rogiyon kii muft chikitsa kii jaati he
 On the same floor is the kitchen, from where a lift comes directly into the garbhagriha
 pujari ganpati ke liye nirmit prasad va laddu isi raste se laate hai
 The 'gabhara' i
e
 garbhagraha of the newly constructed temple has been designed in such a way that more and more devotees can see Ganapati directly from the sabhamandap
 pehle manzil kii gailariyaan bhi is tarah banaai gai hai ki bhakt vahaan se bhi sidhe darshan kar sakate hai
 Ashtabhuji Garbhagraha is about 10 feet wide and 13 feet high
 garbhagrah ke chabutare par swarna shikhar vaala chaandi kaa sundar mandap he, jisamen siddhi vinayak virajte hai
 There are three doors for the devotees to go to the garbhagriha, on which the figures of Ashtavinayak, Ashtalakshmi and Dashavatara are painted
 vaise bhi siddhivinayak mandir main har mangalvaar ko baari sankhya main bhaktagan ganpati bappa ke darshan kar apni abhilaashaa puri karte hai
 On Tuesday, it is so crowded that after standing in line for four-five hours, you can see it
 har saal ganpati puja mahotsav yahaan bhadrapada kii chaturthi se anant chaturdashi tak vishesh samaaroh purvak manaaya jaataa he
 In the old times, to protect a city from outside attack, a strong wall built around the city is 'perkota', which had gates for entry
 bundelkhand ke nivaasiyon dwaara boli jane vaali boli bundeli he
 It is very difficult to say how old Bundeli is spoken, but the typical Bundeli words are unique which are used by the Saadi till date
 bundelkhandi ke dheron shabdon ke arth bangla tathaa maithili bolne vaale aasaani se bataa sakate hai
 In ancient times, records of official correspondence, messages, invoices, gazette and friendship treaties are found in abundance in Bundeli
 kaha to yah bhi jaataa he ki aurangzeb or shivaji bhi kshetra ke hindu raajaaon se bundeli main hi patr vyavhaar karte the
 The typical Bundeli dictionary also differs from Hindi and is not believed to be based on Sanskrit
 ek-ek kshan ke liye alag-alag shabd hai
 There are twenty-one words in Bundeli for lonely evening, to describe nature in songs
 bundeli main vaividhya he, isamen banda kaa akkhadpan he or narsinghpur kii madhurata bhi he
 Narsinghpur vartmaan bundelkhand chedi, dasharn evam kaarush se judaa tha
 Many tribes resided here
 inamen kol, nishad, pulind, kiraad, naag, sabhi kii apni swatantra bhashaaen thi, jo vichaaron abhivyaktiyon kii madhyam thim
 The mention of this dialect is found in Bharatamuni's Natya Shastra, meaning Shafar, Bhil, Chandal, Sajar, Dravidodbhava, Heena Vane Vaaranam and Vibhasha Natakam Smritam
 sanskrit bhashaa ke vidrohswarup praakrit evam apbhransh bhashaaon kaa vikaas hua
 There was a multiplicity of indigenous words among them
 hemchandra suri ne pamarajanon main prachlit praakrit apbhransh kaa vyakaran dashavi shatee main likhaa
 madhyadeshiy bhashaa kaa vikaas is kaal main ho rahaa tha
 Numerous words of Vindhyeli are found in Hemachandra's dictionary
 barahavin sadi main damodar pandit ne ukti vyakti prakaran kii rachana kii
 Many words of Old Awadhi and Shaurseni Braj are mentioned in it
 isi kaal main arthath ek hajaar isvi main bundeli purv apbhransh ke udhaaharan praapt hote hai
 It had a multiplicity of indigenous words
 pan kishori laal vaajapeyi, likhit hindi shabdanushasan ke anusaar hindi ek swatantra bhashaa he, uski prakruti sanskrit tathaa apbhransh se bhinn he
 Bundeli's mother Prakrit Shaurseni and father is Sanskrit language
 donon bhashaaon main janmane ke uparaant bhi bundeli bhashaa kii apni chaal, apni prakruti tathaa vaakya vinyas ko apni moulik style he
 Hindi is closer to Sanskrit than Prakrit
 madhyadeshiy bhashaa kaa prabhutv avichhann rup se isa kii pratham sahastrabdi ke saare kaal main or iske purv kaayam rahaa
 The language used by the Siddhas of the Nath and Naga sects differed in different districts
 vah deshaj pradhan lokbhasha thi
 Before this, the language of the villagers of Bhavabhuti North Ramcharit was Vindhyeli ancient Bundeli
 sambhawatah chandel naresh gandadev tathaa uske uttaradhikari vidyadhar ke kaal main bundeli ke praarambhik rup main mahmud gaznavi kii prashansa kii katipay panktiyaan likhi gai
 It was developed through the Raso poetry stream
 jaganic aalhakhand tathaa parmaal raso praudh bhashaa kii rachanaaen hai
 Jaganik and Vishnudas are universally known on the basis of material received as the initial poet of Bundeli, embellished with all the characteristics of Bundeli
 bundeli ke bare main kaha gaya he: bundeli vaa yaa he jon main bundelkhand ke kaviyon ne apni kavita likhi, bartaa likhve vaaron ne varata likhi
 ja bhashaa puure bundelkhand main ekai rup main milat aay
 Many forms of dialect vary according to the wake
