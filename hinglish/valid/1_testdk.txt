 Kamal Ataturk alias Mustafa Kamal Pasha is said to be the creator of modern Turkey
 turki ke samrajyavaadee shaasha sultan abdul hamid dwitiya kaa pasa palat kar vahaan kamaal kii saamaajik, raajnneetik va aarthik vyavastha kaayam karne kaa jo krantikari kaary unhone kiya us aitihaasik kaary ne unke naam ko sarthak siddh kar diya
 Kamal Pasha was born on 19 May 1881 in a peasant family in Salonika
 inaki mata kaa naam juvaida va pita kaa ali raja tha
 Ali Raza was a clerk in Salonika's octroi office
 unka bachapan kaa naam mustafa tha
 The father died a few years after his birth
 mata jubaida ne majahabi talim dilaane ke uddeshy se madrase main daakhil kara diya jahaan unke senior chatro ke tang karne par vah marane maarane par utar aaye
 At the age of just 11, he had become so bad that he had to be removed from Maktab
 baad main unhen monastir ke sainik skool main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 But there too, his die-hard extremist nature remained, but due to his interest in military education, his studies continued unabated, there was no disruption in him
 balak mustafa ugr avashya tha parantu ganit main uski gati aashcharya janak thi
 As soon as he wrote a question on the black board of the teacher, he used to solve it by force
 usamen kamaal kii kaabiliyat dekhakar skool ke ganit adhyaaapak captain mustafa ufindi ne naam badal kar kamaal rakh diya
 Only then did he become known as Kamal Pasha
 17 saal kii umr main monastir ke primary sainik skool main praarambhik sainya shiksha praapt karne ke baad unhen kustuntuniya ke staff kalege main ucch sainya shiksha hetu bhej diya gaya
 In those days, there was the Sultanate of Abdul Hameed in Kustuntunia and his crown was called Sultan
 vahaan vah adhyayan ke saath-saath buree sangat main ghoomte rahe
 After spending a brief period of arrogant life, he became the first member of a secret revolutionary party called Watan and became its leader only a few days later
 vatan kaa uddeshy ek taraf sultan kii taanaashaahee or duusari taraf videshi shadyantron ko jad se mitaanaa tha
 One day the meeting of the party was going on that some intelligence gave news to the Sultan and all the conspiracy officers were arrested and sent to jail
 prachlit kanoon ke anusaar un sabko mrityudand diya ja saktaa tha, par durbalchitt sultan ko bhay tha ki kahin aisa karne par desh main vidroh na bhadak uthe, at: usne sabkon kshamaadaan dene kaa nishchay kiya
 Thus, along with other soldiers, Kamal was also left in pardon
 tatpashchaat sultan ne druj jati ke vidroh ko dabaane ke liye unhen damishq bhej diya
 There Kamal did a wonderful job, but according to his nature he returned to Kustantunia and after opening a room in Stambool, he opened the office of watan-o-hurriyat Party and started the work of the secret organization of freedom in it
 isi bich unhen yah gyaat hua ki macedoniya main sultan ke viruddh khulaa vidroh hone vaala he
 Sensing the exaggeration of the occasion, Kamal took leave from the Sultan's army and disguised as Jaffa, Mirua and Athens and reached Salonika, the center of the rebellion
 parantu vahaan par unhen pahchaan liya gaya
 Then he ran towards Jaffa via Greece
 par tab tak unki giraftaar kaa aadesh vahaan bhi pahunch chukaa tha
 An officer named Ahmed Bay had the burden of capturing Kamal, but since Ahmed himself was a member of the country, he instead of arresting Kamal sent him to the Gaza front and sent a report to the Sultan that he had not gone on leave
 Were
 yadhyapi kamaal salonika main bahut thode samay tak hi rah paye, phir bhi unhone yah bhalee-bhanti samaj liya tha ki salonika ko hi vidroh kaa kendra bananaa thik rahegaa, isaliye bade prayatnon ke baad san 1908 main unhone apana sthaanantaran salonika hi karvaa liya
 Here two years ago under the leadership of Anwar, a revolutionary party was established in the name of unity and progress committee
 kamaal tatkaal uske sadsy ban gayi, parantu dal ke netaaon se unki nahin baniin
 Nevertheless, he continued to do the work of the committee
 is dal ke ek netaa niyazi ne keval kuch sau aadamiyon ko lekar turki sarkaar ke viruddh vidroh bol diya
 Although it was a matter of great stupidity, but since the whole country was ready, the army that was sent to fight it also went to Anwar
 is prakaar desh main anwar kaa jai-jayakaar ho gaya
 Now the co-operative army was preparing to attack the capital
 sultan ne inhen dinon kuch shashan-sudhaar bhi kiye
 Even then the powers of the rebellion continued to work, but when the rebellion was successful, Sultan Abdul Hameed joined some of the army with enough bribe, which led the soldiers to revolt and kill their officers and once more Islam, Slogans of Sultan and Khalifa's Jai were raised
 in dinon anwar berlin main the
 He soon returned and he put Abdul Hameed on the throne and hanged several reactionary leaders
 is prakaar anwar kii krantikari samiti ke haath main prashasnic shakti aa gayi
 In order to confound the general public, the Sultan's nephew was placed on the throne
 idhar kamaal pasha anwar ke viruddh nirantar shadyantr karte rahe kyonki unke vichaar se anwar beshak adarshavaadi the kintu avyaavhaarik adhik vyakti the
 Despite all this, Anwar continuously thwarted the foreign invasions that occurred at that time, this increased Anwar's fame in public
 iske baad anwar ne apane sarv islamic swapn ko satya karne ke liye kaary armbh kiya or unhone iske liye sabase pehla kaam yah kiya ki turki sena ko sangathit karne kaa bhaar ek german general ko diya
 Kamal started the movement against this, saying that this is an insult to the Turkish race
 is par kamaal ko sainik doot banaakar sofia bhej diya gaya
 Meanwhile, the great war broke out
 isamen anwar safal nahin ho sake, par kamaal ne ek yuddh main kustantuniya par adhikaar karne kii british chaal ko vifal kar diya or uske baad unki jeet par jeet hoti chali gayi
 Nevertheless, Turkey was defeated in the Great War
 kamaal din raat parishram karke videshiyon ke viruddh aandolan karte rahe
 Sevra's treaty was announced in 1920, but its conditions were so bad that Kamal immediately prepared an army and prepared to attack Kustuntunia
 isi bich greece ne turki par hamalaa kar diya or smarana main sena utaar di jo kamaal ke pradhan kendra angaara kii taraf badhane lagi
 Now a big problem has arisen for Kamal, because if they lose in this war, then there is no possibility
 isaliye unhone badi taiyaari ke saath yuddh kiya jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki dhire-dhire greek sena ko peeche hatana padaa
 Meanwhile, France and Russia also started secretly assisting Kamal
 thode dinon main hi greek nikaal baahar kiye gaye
 Only after exorcising the Greeks, there was a question of removing the remaining parts from the British
 desh unke saath tha, iske atirikt britain ab ladane ke liye bilkul taiyaar nahin tha
 For this reason this problem was also solved
 kamaal ne desh ko prajatantra ghoshit kiya or swayan pratham raashtrapati bane
 Now the state was almost dead, but there was constant opposition from the Mullahs
 isapar kamaal ne sarkari akhabaaron main islam ke viruddh prachaar shuru kiya
 Now the religious leaders have issued fatwa against them and started saying that Kamal has propagated modern dance in the country by taking women out of the curtains in Angora, in which men dance with women, it should end
 har masjid se yah aawaaj uthaayi gayi
 Then Kamal ended the Khilafat system in March 1924 and introduced a bill in Parliament declaring Turkey as a secular nation
 adhikansh sansad sadasyon ne iskaa virodh kiya, par kamaal ne unhen kasake dhamkaaya
 His threat was strongly affected and the bill was passed
 par bheetar-bheetar mullaon ke vidroh kii aag baraab sulagati rahi
 Many of Kamal's former friends were reunited with the mullahs
 in logon ne videshi poonjipatiyon se dhan bhi liya tha
 Kamal arrested his main leaders and hanged him one day
 kamaal ne dekha ki keval phaansi par chadhaane se kaam nahin chalegaa, desh ko aadhunik rup se shikshit karnaa he tathaa puraane reeti rivaajon ko hi nahin, pahanaave aadi ko bhi samaapt karnaa he
 Kamal made his first attack on the Turkish cap
 is par vidroh hue, par kamaal ne sena bhej di
 After this, they removed Islamic laws and replaced them with a new code which included all the good things of Switzerland, Germany and Italy
 bahu-vivaah gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Along with this, husbands were told not to treat their wives like drums and to treat them equally
 prayek vyakti ko vot kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Bribes were prohibited in services and severe bribes were given to bribes
 striyon ke pahanaave se pardaa uthaa diya gaya or purush puraane dhang ke pariched chhodkar suut pahanane lage
 An even greater improvement was that the Roman script was replaced by the Arabic script
 kamaal swayan sadakon par jaakar roman varna-maala main turki bhashaa padhaate rahe
 As a result, the whole of Turkey became united and the feeling of isolation ended
 iske saath hi kamaal ne turki sena ko atyant aadhunik dhang se sangathit kiya
 Thus the Ottoman caste became the modern caste due to Kamal Pasha
 san 1938 ke navambar maas kii 10 taarikh ko mustafaa kamaal ataturk kii mrityu hui tab tak aadhunik turki ke nirmaataa ke rup main unka naam sansar main suraj kii tarah chamak chukaa tha
 Although Kamal Pasha had four love affairs with four women in his life, but he married only Latifi Ussaki
 yadhyapi usase kamaal ko koi santaan nahin hui or vah nissantan hi mar gayi
 After Bibi's death, Mustafa Kamal Pasha never married

 She had 7 children and one miscarriage due to the immoral relationship her father had made with her
 teen bacchon ko unki maan ke saath hi kaid main rakhaa gaya: putree carustin, 19; or do putr stifan, 18 or felics, 5
 Another son Michael died of breathing problems three days after his birth
 anya teen bacchon kaa paalan fritzl or uski patni rosemeri dwaara kiya gaya
 In relation to these three children, he made the excuse that these three found him lying on the road
 24 agast 1984 ke din elizabeth ke pita ne use ek darvaaze ko tahkhaane main rakhane ke liye sahaayta ke liye bulaayaa or ether se use behosh karke ek chupe hue chote tahkhaane main band kar diya or 26 april 2008 ke apane rihaai ke din tak wo vahin rahi
 Elizabeth's sudden disappearance caused her mother to report to the police, but Joseph Fritzl concocted a fictitious story that she has run away from her will and has subscribed to a religious sect in a town called Brunau 
 iske liye usne apni putree dwaara likhe gaye patr ko bhi police ko dikhaaya or phir ye maamla band kar diya gaya
 During these 24 years of captivity, no one was allowed to come to the cellar and his wife could not come down enough

 According to Vishnu Purana the human hand dimensions are as follows: - vaayu ne manu ke adhikaar ke antargat uparokt samaan gananaa di he, jo ki manu samhita main nahin ullekith he:- This is not explained in detail
 shrimati trini visteern su vibhakta mahapatha
 1-5-7 7
 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
