 hindu dharmagranthon main asur ve log hai jo 'sur' se sangharsh karte hai
 In the scriptures, they are depicted as powerful, superhuman, half-gods
 ye achche or bure donon gunon vaale hai
 Asuras with good qualities are called 'aditya' and asuras with bad qualities are called 'demons'

 In particular, this word used with Indra, Mitra and Varuna signifies their special power

 As a result, in the Vedic 'vrittraghna' avasta as 'wertroghna' became the signifier of a specific monster and the word 'asura' of Iranians was used in the Rigveda for the anti-devas who were killed by Indra with their thunderbolt
 
 It is believed by the Satapatha Brahmin that the Asuras use ungodly language from devotion

 usne europea raajnneeti main itani pramukh bhoomika nibhaai ki 1815 se 1848 tak ke europea itihaas kaa kaal 'meternikh yug’ ke naam se prasiddh he
 During his prime ministership, Maternich adopted a policy of imitating reaction and conservatism and due to its influence the Kingdom of Austria became very important in Europe

 He was a nobleman

 He considered the king to be the representative of God
 vah nirankush shashan kaa samarthak tha
 He was in favor of maintaining the status quo
 matternik vyavastha or uski niti mukhyatah austrian aavashyaktaa par aadhaarit thi
 In fact, people of different caste, language, religion, tradition lived in Austria
 aise samrajya main rashtravaadi bhaavana kaa udai rajya ko tukdon main baant detaa he
 In such a situation, Maternic's policy was to maintain the status quo at any cost and to crush the emerging nationalist sentiment
 matternik ne austria main udaaravaadi vichaardhaara ke pravesh maarg ko avaruddha kar diya
 Under this, he curbed the idea of freedom
 udaaravaadi vichaardhaara vaali pustakon ko samrajya main ghusane par roak lagaai
 Prohibited Austrians from going abroad
 vishvavidhyalay ke shikshakon ore chaatro par jasuson ke dwaara kadi najar rakhi jane lagi
 In this way, Maternick kept away from the nationality of Austria and the feelings of revolution
 matternik is baat ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhataa tha ki uskaa austria tabhi akshunn rah saktaa he jab europe ke anya kshetron main bhi is tarah kii vyavastha lagu kii jaae
 It was in this context that he tried to crush the liberal movement by creating a union in Germany
 carlswad kii ghoshnaa kar usne rashtravaadi sansthaanon par pratibandh lagaaya, samachar patron par niyantran lagaaya or udaarvaad ke prachaar par roak lagaai
 When these restrictions were opposed in Germany in 1830, Maternick crushed it with the help of friendly countries
 isi prakaar italy main bhi rashtravaadi / udaaravaadi andolan ko dabaaya gaya
 The period from 1815–28 was the success of Maternick
 is kaal main pragatisheel vichaardhaara avaruddha rahi or pratikriyaavaadi vichaardhaara kii vijay hui
 It is in this context that it was said that "maternick was a suitable person for a jaded and Bhiru generation
" " The rise of Maternic on the political scene of Europe after the French Revolution and Napoleon's wars was indicative of a new era commonly called the Maternic Age
 yah yug 1815-1848 tak rahaa or is kaal main usne europe kii raajnneeti ko apane tareeke se sanchalit kiya
 This era was characterized by a fierce struggle between reactionary and progressive ideologies
 ek taraf rashtrawaad prajatantr kii bhaavana to duusari taraf anudaarataavaad or pratikriyavaad kii bhaavana thi
 Maternic was a supporter of reactionary ideology
 The formula of all his policy was - "rule and do not let any change happen
" " usne apni prakriyaavaadi niti ko anjaam dene ke liye jin taur-tareekon kaa istemaal kiya use 'matternik vyavastha' kaha gaya
 The purpose of this system was to strike a balance in Europe
 vah santulan jise france kii kranti or nepolian ke yudhon ne bhang kar diya tha
 Metternich was determined not to allow revolutionary ideas to flourish in Austria
 inhen krantikari bhaawanaaon ke bhadakne par vah patan ko praapt hua
 In his view, revolution was a disease which no one is diagnosed with when it erupts
 atah is beemaari ko ugr rup dhaaran karne se pehle hi jaise hi iske lakshan dikhaai de, dabaa dena chaiye
 It is a volcano, so it should be protected before it explodes
 raja ko vah ishwar kaa doot maanata tha or is ishwar ke pratinidhi ko janata ke bhagya niptaare kaa har adhikaar praapt hota he evam vah janata ke prati kabhi bhi uttaradaayi nahin hota
 He was a firm supporter of these principles and brought these principles into practice throughout his life
 meternikh ek mahaan rajanyajna tha
 He was rich in extraordinary talent
 nepolian senapati ko parajeet karne main austria ne mahatvapurn bhaag liya tha, atah europe se punarnirmaan ke maamalon ko tay karne ke liye 1815 main vienna main europea rashtron kaa sammelan hua tha or ashtrin chancelar meternikh ne apni vilakshan rajanyik pratibha se sabase prabhavit kiya tha
 It was Materich itself that made Austria so powerful that its domination was established again in Europe
 austria-hungary par 1792 se 1835 tak francis pratham or 1835 se 1848 tak ferdinand pratham ne rajya kiya
 Austria was the only state in Europe that had no effect on the French Revolution of 1789
 samrajya bhar main visheshadhikaryukt kulinon or padariyon kaa shashan ekadam rinankush rahaa
 There could be no promotion of any kind of liberal ideas
 jahaan nepolian kaa yug astr-shastr kaa yug tha vahaan meternikh yug kaa rajya yaa mantri kaa yug tha
 Metternich was the most talented politician of his era
 nepolian ke patan or european vyavastha ke sanghathan main uskaa pramukh haath tha
 Almost all the rulers of that era were influenced by Meterich
 madhya or purvi europe rashtriya evam anterrashtriya vidhaan meternikh kii niti ke anusaar hi chalate the
 Germany, Austria and Italy were under his shadow
 vastav main jis tarah nepolian ne sampoorn europe par 15 varsh tak apni dhak jamaaye rakhi, usee tarah meternikh bhi lagbhag 40 saal tak europe kii raajnneetik pragati par apana niyantran rakhe rahaa
 He was a very egoistic person who believed that the order of the world was going on with it
 vah kaha karata tha- "meri sthiti main vah vilakshan baat he ki jahaan bhi main hota hum sabaki aashaaen, sabaki aakhen vahiin lagi rahati hai
 What is the reason that among innumerable people, i think only when other people think nothing; Only i work while others do nothing; And i only write because others are not worthy
 " meterrikh kaa vishwaas tha ki uski mrityu hone par uske rikt sthaan kii purti kabhi nahin kii ja sakegi
 Metternich was a staunch enemy of revolutionary sentiments
 france kii kranti ke do mahatvapurn siddhanton, rashtriyata or prajatantra, ko vah 'bahut bhayanak rog' samajhataa tha
 He used to say that the terrible disease of revolution should be stopped soon, otherwise it would spread very quickly and take a horrific form which would destroy the whole of Europe
 meternikh praayah kaha karata tha- "kranti ek bhayanak or vishaal daitya kii bhaanti he jo samast europe kii saamaajik or raajnneetik vyavastha ko nigal sakati he
 "in the view of Metternich," the revolution was like a piece of rotten deodorant flesh that required a very hot and red iron to be consumed
 " meternikh ko kranti se atyant chidh thi
 His diplomacy was in this direction that the antecedent political system should be created by reproducing the situation before the revolution throughout Europe
 meternikh austria samrajya kii suraksha karnaa apana pavitra karttavya samajhataa tha
 This was possible only when the principles propounded by the French Revolution were crushed
 meternikh jaanata tha ki austria kaa samrajya anek jatiyon kaa jamghat he or aise samrajya kaa shashan rashtriyata ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par nahin chalaaya ja saktaa
 He never tolerated that the general public would gain political rights and take over the governance of the country, so in order to protect the Austrian Empire from the waves of revolution, Metternich introduced a method known as 'metternich method'
 
 meternikh ne apni niti ko safal banane ke liye shakti kaa nahin varan rajanyik or raajnneetik dabaav kaa sahaara liya
 This system of his was different from the then European system, so his policy was named after him as the 'metternich system'
 is meternikh pranali ke do spasht rup the- During his prime ministership, Maternich adopted a policy of imitating reaction and conservatism and due to its influence the Kingdom of Austria became very important in Europe
 apni niti kii vyakhya karte hue usne ek baar england ke pradhanmantri pamarston ko likhaa tha ki "ham virodhatmak niti isliye apana rahe hai ki hamen damankaaree niti apnaane ke liye bebas na hona pade
 We have a certain belief that it would be fatal for the state to accept the demands of reform
 " Maternich believed that home policy and foreign policy cannot be seen separately
 ek desh kii ghatnaon kaa duusare deshon par prabhaav padataa he
 Therefore, no country can watch events happening in a country like an audience
 usko dabaane ke liye rajyon ko sammilit rup se hastkshep karnaa chaiye
 First Metternich implemented his system in his own country
 1815 se 1818 tak vah austria kaa sarvashaktishaalee pradhanmantri rahaa
 During this period there were two emperors in Austria - Francis i and Ferdinand I
 donon samraaton ko usne ek hi niti kaa paalan karne kaa paraamarsh diya, vah thi ‘yathasthiti’ banaae rakhane kii niti
 In addition, he also adopted a policy of repression and strict control of liberal ideas in the austrian-hungarian Empire
 meternikh ek bahut swaarthee rajaneta tha
 In Austria it was possible to tighten the cloak of reaction, but it was necessary to stop the propagation of new and liberal ideas even outside the empire
 saath hi europe main austria netritv kare, yah bhi meternikh kii abhilaashaa thi
 Metternich was familiar with the growing power of Napoleon
 usne ek baar kaha tha, "agar france ko zukam ho jaataa he to puraa europe chheenkne lagata he
 "at the same time, he also knew that the Tsar of Russia was also an enemy of Austria, so he adopted a policy that Napoleon and Russia should fight and destroy each other so that Austria would remain a powerful state of Europe
 meternikh ne nepolian ko haraane ke liye rus ko aage kiya or swayan gupt rup se rus ke shaasha ke viruddh yojanaayen banaata rahaa
 When Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, Metternich assured the Tsar of Russia that he would not take an active part in the war on either side, but on the other hand he prepared an army to assist Napoleon
 vastutah meternikh usee kii sahaayta ke liye taiyaar tha jisase austria ko laabh ho
 Therefore, he always kept the Austrian army ready with a view to support the victorious party
 lipatsig ke yuddh main usne mitra-rashtron kaa saath diya or nepolian ko parajeet karne ke liye mukhya bhaag liya
 Russia did not let the fame of its dual policy and victory on the other hand
 isliye vienna congress main sab raashtra meternikh kii maitri ke aakankshi the
 After Napoleon I, there was no politician in Europe who could match Metternich
 atah vienna congress main austria ke gaurav ko badhaayaa
 This Chancellor of Austria became the Chairman of the Vienna Congress
 vienna congress ke nirnyon par meternikh kaa sabase adhik prabhaav rahaa
 Even after Napoleon's defeat, his principles remained fearful
 meternikh samajhataa tha ki yadi swatantrata, samanta or bhraatrutiv ke siddhanton kaa bolbalaa rahaa to austria bhi unase prabhavit ho saktaa he
 Therefore, to prevent its possible spread, it played an active role in the Vienna Congress
 nirankushta or nyaayyata ke siddhanth par bal dete hue bhi usne europea shakti-santulan par dhyaan rakhaa tathaa es niti apanaai ki sabhi bade rashtron ke swaarthon kii yathasambhav purti ho sake
 Metternich understood that this was the way to maintain unity among large nations
 ye meternikh kii hi kootneeti thi ki france kii shakti acchhee tarah simit kar di gai or austria tathaa france k bich aisi vyavastha kii gai ki france ke krantikari vichaar austria main na ghus saken
 It was the magic of Metternich's diplomacy that Austria got Lambardi, Venice and Babasia
 europe ke anek rajyon kii simaaen purvawat raheen
 Restored ancient dynasties and provided compensation to the damaged states
 rus ke jaar or prasha ke raja par uskaa jaadu chaaya rahaa
 He organized the German state, but the head of all was made king of Austria
 vastav main vienna congress ke uddeshy or nirnay adhikanshtah meternikh kii buddhi kii upaj the
 To provide stability to the decisions of the Vienna Congress, Metternich established a joint system
 chaturmukhi maitri ko kaaryrup main parinat kar dikhaanaa meternikh kii hi adbhut kshamta thi
 As a joint arrangement, he sought to build a 'fire brigade' that would extinguish the flames of revolution everywhere in Europe
 is vyavastha ke madhyam se meternikh ne nepolian ke yudhon se jarjarit europe ko shaanti pradaan karne kii cheshtaa kii
 This is the second thing that the changes brought about by his policy could not be sustained because they lacked liberal and national sentiments
 phir bhi use europe main 30 varsh tak shaanti banaae rakhane main safalataa mili
 Germany was devastated by the Napoleonic Wars; Nevertheless, at the Vienna Congress, he established a union of 39 states in Germany in aid of his supporters
 austrian samraat iskaa adhyaksh bana
 Simultaneously, a Parliament was established in the Union of States in which representatives appointed by all the kings of Germany could participate
 yah vyavastha meternikh ne is vyavastha kii sahaayta se prajatantra ke samarthakon ko kathor dand dilwakar unki bhaawanaaon ko kuchal diya
 He called a session of the Parliament in 1819 and passed his willful repressive law and implemented them all over Germany
 in kathor nirdeshon ke kaaran 1818 se 1849 tak germany main raajnneetik sannata chaaya rahaa
 Due to the fear of Metternich, constitutional rule could not be established in any state except some states of Germany
 meternikh kii damankaaree niti or kootnithik chaalon se germany main updrav va aandolan to shant ho gayi, lekin german janata austria se ghrinaa karne lagi
 Due to the oppressive policy of Metternich, the public became silent from above, but the fire of revolution within itself kept on burning
 prasha germany kaa ek shaktishaalee rajya tha jo vyapaar or kala-kaushal ke kshetra main aage badha hua tha
 There, the use of the oppressive policy of Metternich could not be particularly fruitful
 nepalian kii paraajay ke baad 1815 kii vienna congress ne italy ko phir chote-chote rajyon main vibhakt kar diya
 Now there, the cruel, arbitrary sentiments of Metternich were harshly crushed
 pindamount or neples main vidroh hue, kintu meternikh ne rus or prasha ko apni ore mila liya or tropo-sammelan se anumati praapt karke vidroho ko krurtapurvak dabaa diya
 He again established autocratic rule by suppressing the revolutionaries; But a secret committee of revolutionaries called Carbonari continued to do their work in secret
 avasar milane par modna, taskani, bolgana aadi se bhayankar vidroh hue
 In other parts of Italy, there was peace due to the influence of Metternich
 shaniah shaniah daman-niti ke kaaran austria kaa shashan italysiyon ke liye asay ho gaya, atah austrian phujon kii vahaan se nikalne ke liye aandolan hua jise antatah meternikh dabaa na sakaa
 In Spain too, the game of matronym diplomacy has been to quell the nationalist spirit
 unaniyon ke swatantra aandolan ke viruddh bhi meternikh kaa ghor pratikriyaavaadi ruukh rahaa
 The size of the jar did not help the Greeks under the influence of Metternich
 europe ke duusare rajyon ne bhi unani janata ko unke swatantrata-sangram main madad nahin di
 Metternich said, "the nuisance needs to be consumed outside the confines of civilization
 " prarambh main rus kaa jaar elexender udaar vichaaron se prabhavit tha, kintu 1815 ke baad vah kramshah meternikh ke prabhaav main aata gaya or treepo sammelan ke samay usne spasht rup se kah diya ki vah meternikh kaa anuyaayi he
 As a result of the support of large nations in defeating Napoleon, Castlere in England and Metternich in Austria were partners in the Vienna Conference; Therefore, in Europe, to maintain a 'status quo', a quadrilateral friendship came into existence, but where Meternich advocated the 'principle of interference' in joint system conferences, England insisted on the principle of 'non-interference'
 meternikh apane sampoorn pradhan-mantritvakaal main ghor pratikriyaavaadi bana rahaa
 He proved himself a staunch enemy of nationalism and democracy
 krantiyon ko kulchane ke liye or pragatisheel pravritiyon ke daman ke liye usne europe ke deshon ke aantarik maamalon main khulkar bhaag liya
 For almost 33 years he worked as a 'policeman' throughout Europe
 jahaan kahin kranti hui vah turant danda lekar pahunch gaya or kranti evam nav-chetana ko puri tarah dabaa kar hi vahaan se lautaa
 Alexander I, the Tsar of Russia, and Fredrik, the Emperor of Prussia, were rulers of liberal attitude from the beginning, but under the influence of Metternich, these rulers too became like him
 1815 se 1848 tak matternikh kranti ke tatwon kaa daman karata rahaa, parantu 1848 kii kranti ne uski jaden hilaa deen
 Hearing the news of the 1848 revolution, he said- "I am an old hakim
 main bhalee prakaar jaanata hoon ki saadhy or asaadhya rog main kya antar he? yah rog praan-ghaatak he
 "his statement was correct
 march, 1848 main austria kii rajdhani vienna kii sadaken 'meternikh kaa naash ho’ ke naaron se goonjane lagi
 The Emperor of Austria panicked and dismissed Metternich
 use jaan bachaane ke liye england bhaag janaa padaa
 Thus the autocratic royalty Maternich era came to an end and with the end of Maternich era, an era of European history also came to an end
 meternikh ko chaahe ant main karunajanak patan kaa shikaar hona padaa, par isamen koi sandeh nahin ki vah tatkaaleen europe kaa mahanatam raajnneetijna tha
 With its fall, the era of European history came to an end which began with the Congress of Vienna
 europea itihaas kaa yah yug ‘meternikh yug’ ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Throughout this time, Metternich was not only over Austria, but all of Europe
 11 june 1859 ko 86 varsh kii aayu main vienna main uski mrityu hui
 The first major thing Metternich did was that he comforted Europe for a long time
 nepolian ke yudhon se lahooluhaan europe ko aaraam or shaanti ko badi jarurat thi
 During his tenure, Metternich tried its best to maintain peace in Europe
 san 1815 i0 ke baad 40 varshon tak europe main jo shaanti kaayam rahi, uskaa shrey sahi arth main meternikh ko hi diya ja saktaa he, chaahe yah shaanti bahut mahangi padi ho
 Metternich was the great diplomat of his time
 vah apane samay main europea raajnneeti kaa kendra tha
 But in the struggle between the reactionary and progressive powers, it was natural and sure for the Progressive powers to be victorious
 isiilie meternikh kaa patan hua
 Nevertheless, from 1815 to 1848, it remained the pillar of the reactionary powers
 uske patan ke baad hi pratikriyavaad kaa mahal dhah sakaa
 Maternich once expressed sorrow over his condition, like the famous poet Hesiad, said- "I have come into this world either too soon or too late because the youth of the world is blooming when i am growing old
" 
 yadi pehle se aayaa hota to yug kaa anand letaa or yadi der se aayaa jota to uske nirmaan me sahaayak hota
 " matternik ke tamaam prayatnon ke baavjood rashtrawaad, udaarvaad or prajatantr kii bhaavana ne europe ko prabhavit kar diya
 In fact, industrialization and consequent social changes made the collapse of the maternal system inevitable
 samrudh hota burjua varg matternik sarkaar kii pichhadi hui aarthik niti se ashaant ho uthaa tathaa shramik varg kii kathinaayeeyon ne matternik ke 'lohe ke parde' main chhed kar diya
 New plagiarism had started coming to Austria secretly, which led to the demand for political freedom there
 matternik ke lakh prayaason ke baavjood hungary, bohemia main rahane vaale jatiyon main vidroh hone laga
 Greece gained independence in 1829 AD and Belgium became independent of Holland in 1830 AD
 vah matternik vyavastha kii bahut badi vifaltaa thi kyonki isamen rashtrawaad kii jeet hui thi
 As a result of the revolution of 1848, when the rebellion began to spread in Austria and students, labor journalists demanded freedom, censorship, the old Maternick fled Vienna to England, frightened by these demonstrations
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki pragatishiltaa kii bayaar ko vah ek lambey samay tak nahin roak saktaa tha
 Thus, it is seen that Maternic tried to maintain the status quo in Europe and keep away the feelings of nationalism, liberalism and democracy
 lekin janamanas main baith chuki udaarvaad kii bhaavana tathaa parivartan kii aakanksha ko roak paane main asafal rahaa
 In the end, the reactionary policy of Metternich was neither in the interest of Austria nor in the interest of other autocratic rulers of Europe
 yadhyapi vah austria main nirankush rajtantr banaaye rakhane main safal hua, par uski niti se austria ko badi haani pahunchi
 As a result of its policy, Austria remained a backward country in Europe
 sabhyataa ke kisi bhi kshetra main vah pragati na kar sakaa
 In contrast, the pressure in central Europe continued to progress
 unnati, pragati or vikaas kii daud main austria itani buree tarah pichad gaya ki meternikh ke patan ke baad europe kaa netritv prasha ke haath main aa gaya
 In 1866, Austria was defeated by Prasha and left Germany
 yadi meternikh thodaa bhi udaaravaadi hota to sambhavtah austria ko aise durdin na dekhne padate
 Nevertheless, we must not forget that Metternich was the Chancellor of Austria, so it was necessary that his policy was compatible with the interests of Austria
 austrian samrajya kaa kaayam rakhana uskaa karttavya tha
 The Austrian empire was a confluence of various castes and if Metternich had followed the principle of nationality, it would have meant inviting the destruction of the empire
 atah naveen bhaawanaaon ko kulchana swaabhaavik tha
 If there was another person in place of Metternich, he would probably follow the footsteps of Metternich
 meternikh kaa moolyankan karte hue pro fisher ne likhaa he- "meternikh pranali se austrian shaskaon ko ek peedi kaa yash praapt hua
 These people knew the difficulties of war in those days
 meternikh main ek mahaan raajnneetik netaa ke anek gun the
 He was rich and sharp, calm, calm, deep-minded and patriotic
 apane desh ke muktdita tathaa naveen europe ke nirmaataa ke rup main uskaa baari sammaan tha
 German-speaking countries had immense faith in it
 nirankush or swechhachari raajaaon ke sammelnon kaa vahi sanchaalan karata tha
 Therefore, if the period 1815 to 1848 is called 'metternich Age', it is right
 par yah mahaan yogya samant, jiskaa charitra itnaa hin, jiske siddhanth atyant kathor or jiskaa prabhaav itnaa suvistrut tha, ek bahut badi maansik durbalata kaa shikaar tha
 He did not try to find a way between these two systems of 'revolution' and 'arbitrary rule'
 chunki kranti se use atyant ghrinaa thi, atah usne is bhaavana kaa, jise samaaj main maanavtapurna jivan kii aatma athwa swatantrata kaa praan mana ja saktaa he, daman karne kaa bidaa uthaaya
