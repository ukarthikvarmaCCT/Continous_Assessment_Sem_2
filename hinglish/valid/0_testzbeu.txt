 In the middle class Avadhutika of Bodhichitta, different types of pleasures are told from vertigo
 avadhootopanishad Shantipath: - Brahma protect both of us as well, follow both of us together, let us both be powerful together, let both of us study mighty, let us not expose anyone
 l Peace, peace, peace, now Sankriti went to Lord Dattatreya and asked - "O Lord! Who is the Avadhoota? What is his condition? What is his sign? And what is his world like?" Hearing this, the most merciful Lord Dattatreya said --- the letter, which is made indestructible, is the best, the world is devoid of bondage and 'tattvamsi' should be the target form of sentences, that is called 'avadhoot' ll1ll which is Yogi Ashram
 And by keeping the varna in the soul and always remains in the soul, it is called 'avadhoot', a yogi without Varnashrama, ll2ll Priyabraha, whose head is turned to the right side and Pramod the left arm, its position is cow
 Area is on the same foot as head of ll3ll Gopal, It is not in the middle and is not even below, the prestige form of all is called braha tchal, so it should be asked the shape of ll4ll thus they attain the ultimate path by four ways ll5ll by how many karmas, or subjects or money
 Immortality is not attained, but immortality has been maintained by renunciation alone
 Ll6ll behave according to your will, this is their world
 How many of them wear clothes and how many are They are also without clothes
 There is neither religion nor anything unrighteous for them, they are not holy and not even impure
 From the point of view, they perform Ashmeedha Yagya in the interiors
 That is their Mahayagya and Mahayoga
 Thus all their The character is astonishing
 They should not condemn such an expletive, because this is their great lord
 They do not indulge like fools
 Just as the sun gives all the juices The Rhn and fire all the account, In the same way, if the yogi suffers the subjects, then being purified does not become a part of sin and virtue
 Ll7-9ll
 Even if it is filled from all sides, water enters the sea of immovable reputation in the same way
 - Even if the occupants enter, he attains peace, but a person who is willing to do things will not get the same kind of peace ll10ll, so the truth is that no one has a rhythm, someone's origin There is no tie, there is no bond, there is no seeker, there is no liberation and there is no liberation too ll11ll For the accomplishment of this world and the acts of the hereafter, in the same way i must do a lot for the accomplishment of liberation
 Was, but now all this has been done, in this way Avdhoot, doing the main research of each yoga, is thankful in this and always remains satisfied ll12-13ll extremely sad from the wish of ignorant son etc
 Stay Fँsate in Hokrsnsar, But i am full of bliss, then with what desire do i get trapped in the world? ll14ll those who wish to go to otherworldly deeds may do good deeds with that desire, but i am the soul of all the people --- i have become all popular, so why should i do any deed? ll15ll who have the right to do this, even if they preach and even if they continue to teach the Vedas, i do not have the right to do it, because i am not ready
 i do not wish for alms, bathing or defecation
 They may imagine others, but what do i benefit from imagining others? Others may accuse him of fire because of the redness of the Gunja, but it does not burn the heap of Grinja, then there is no charge of the religions of the world inside me, so i do not worship anyone who has elements They may not listen, even if they listen, but i know the element, then why should i listen? Those who are in doubt, Even if they meditate, i am not skeptical or not, i do not contemplate it, lll18ll who has had a catastrophe, even if he will die, but where there is no calamity, what is the need of meditation? i would never have the desire to consider the body as a soul, i am a human, etc
 This type of behavior is not without any antithesis and this antithesis is also due to the lust that has been practiced for a long time
 Only when it is done, this behavior stops, but even if the destiny karma is not destroyed, even by doing a thousand meditations, this behavior does not calm down, even if you wish to reduce the behavior, you may Yan can, not only the behavior of the works, in my view, i do care for what? ll 22 ll i don't get deflected, With this i do not even need to do samadhi
 This is the mind that is disturbed, then it is the deflection and only then samadhi is required
 i am a regular experience, what else can i experience in samadhi? ll23ll i have done what i want to do and have always received what i want to achieve, so why should i behave in cosmic, classical or other ways? Then i am not the doer, i do not indulge in anything, only by following destiny karma, even if there is a tendency to be 24-25 ll or i am grateful, even if i walk according to scripture with a desire to grace people What is my loss in this? ll 26 ll Devotees worship, bath, defecation, begging etc
 Even if the body moves, even if you chant the voice of speech, likewise recite the Upanishads, the intellect may meditate on Vishnu or even if Brahman is absorbed in Nand, i am only a witness, That is, i do not do any of these things and do not do them, i am 27, i am satisfied with gratitude and i have received what i want to receive, i am also satisfied with it, thus i keep in my mind constantly 28 ll Then i am blessed — i am blessed, i am blessed — i am blessed, because i know my soul involuntarily
 i am blessed because i have the illumination that illuminates me clearly
 Because i no longer see the sorrow of the world
 i am blessed — i am blessed, because my ignorance has been destroyed, i am blessed — blessed, because i have nothing to do
 i am blessed — blessed that whatever i have received it right here
 i am blessed - i am blessed, there is a liking in my world of fulfillment? l i am blessed - blessed, i am blessed again and again - blessed i am, virtuous! Hey virtue! The wealth of this virtue is firm - it is the pod
 Aho we! Oh wisdom! Oh wisdom! Hey happiness! Aho! Aho! Oh Master! Oh Master! ll 30-35 ll Thus a person who reads this Upanishad is a masterpiece, even if he has drunk a wine, it is holy even if he has stolen the gold, it is holy even if it is Brahmahatya
 Even if done, it is holy
 After attaining such knowledge, it can be instilled in the desired manner

 Kilimanjaro, with its three volcanic cones, Kibo, Mwenzie, and Shira, is a dormant Stratozhvalmukhi in northeastern Tanzania and is the highest mountain in Africa with a height of 5,895 meters or 19,341 feet above sea level
 Kilimanjaro Mountains is the highest free-standing mountain in the world as well as the fourth highest emerged mountain in the world which is 5,882 meters or 19,298 feet high from the base
 kilimanjaro naam kaa sateek arth or utpatti agyaat he
 It is believed to be a combination of the Swahili word Kilima and the Kichaga word Jaro, which translates to "whitewashed", from which the name White Mountain originated
 Another belief is that "jaro" in Chaga / Kichaga means 'our' and therefore Kilimanjaro means our mountain
 It is derived from the Chaga residents who live at the foothills of this mountain
 yah agyaat he ki kilimanjaro naam kahaan se aayaa he, lekin kai siddhant maujuud hai
 European explorers adopted the name by 1860 and stated that it was its Swahili name, and Kilimanjaro is divided into two parts, one is Kilima and the other is Jaro whose origin varies according to the principles - some people According to it is an ancient Swahili word meaning white or glow, or according to non-swahili origin it came from the Kichaga language, the word Jaro means "caravan"
 The problem with all of this is that they cannot explain why the term redundant kilima has been used instead of millima, the proper term for the mountain
 yah naam ek sthaneey hansi-mazaaq kaa hissaa ho saktaa he, jo "jaaro kii choti pahari" ko africa mahadweep kaa sabase bada pahaad sanderbhit karata he, kyonki yah paas kaa shahar he or guide bataate hai ki yah jaaro logon kii pahari he
 In a different view it is believed that it comes from Kichaga Kilmanare or Kiliajo which means "one who defeats birds / leopards / caravans"
 But this theory does not explain the fact that Kilimanjaro in Kitchaga was not used before in Europe in the mid-19th century
 1880 ke dashak main, yah parvat, jisaki german vartanee swahili naam ke ghatakon ke anusaar us samay kilima-ndscharo thi, german purv africa kaa ek hissaa ban gaya jab karl peters ne sthaneey mukhiyaaon ko sandhiyon par hastakshar karne ke liye manaaya 
 1889 main kibo shikhar kaa naam hanse mayer dwaara "kaisar-wilhem-spitje" rakhaa gaya, jab is shikhar par 5 oktober 1889 ko pehali baar chadhaai kii gai
 The name was used until 1918, when German colonies were given to the British Empire after World War I
 jab british prashasit tanganyika ko 1961 main apni swatantraaa praapt hui, to is shikhar kaa naam "uhuru shikhar" rakhaa gaya, jiskaa swahili main arth hota he "swatantraaa shikhar"
 The key-prefix has many underlying meanings in Swahili
 pracheen kaa-alparthak sangya upsarg ko, kii varg ke saath vilay kar diya gaya
 It has another meaning under which it describes anything unique: Kilima, a single peak, unlike Milima, which describes more of a mountain range or uneven country
 kai anya parvaton main bhi yah upsarg laga hua he, jaise ki kilima bogo jo kenya main nairobi ke bilkul uttar main sthit he
 People with disabilities are also placed in the same category, which is not that much of a diminutive idea; Rather a unique situation in which they are: a blind or deaf person, Kipofu and Kiziwi
 This prefix "ki-" does not imply derogatory meaning in any way
 kichaaga main kibo naam kaa arth he "dhabbedaar" jo barfile maidaanon main dikhne vaali chattaanon ko sanderbhit karata he
 Kilimanjaro mountain is the highest mountain in Africa and the fourth highest among the seven peaks
 yah duniya main sabase lanbaa mukt-khadaa pahaad he, jiskaa uhuru shikhar 5,895 me AMSL he
 Kilimanjaro is composed of three different volcanic cones: Kibo 5,895 m॰; Mawenzi 5,149 m and vein 3,962 m
 The Uhuru peak is the highest peak on Kibo's volcanic cavity
 kilimanjaro ek vishaal stratojwalamukhi he jo kareeb ek milian saal pehle gathit hona shuru hua tha, jab lava rift ghati se bahna shuru hua
 Two of its three peaks, Mwenzi and Shira, are extinct while Kibo is dormant and can erupt again

 There are six official climbing routes through which Mount Kilimanjaro can be climbed, their names are: Marangue, Rongai, Lemosho, Shira, Umbwe and Machame
 Of all the routes, Machame is quite panoramic, though its climb up the mountain is quite steep, which can be completed in six or seven days
 rongai sabase aasaan shivi maarg he or marangu bhi apekshaakrit aasaan he, lekin awaas jhopadiyon main hota he
 As a result, this route becomes very busy and the ascent and descent route is the same
 jo log kilimanjaro par chadhaai karnaa chaahate hai unhen upyukt shodh karne kii salaah di jaati he or yah sunishchit karne ke liye kaha jaataa he ki ve uchit rup se las hai or shaareerik rup se sakasham hai
 Although this climb is not technically as challenging as climbing the summit of the Himalayas, the high altitude, low temperatures and occasional strong winds make it a difficult and dangerous climb
 jalwaayu-anukulan jaruri he or iske baad bhi sabase anbhavi parvatarohi bhi tungta bimaari se kuch had tak peedit hote hai
 The Kilimanjaro peak is so high that at that height high altitude pulmonary edema, or high altitude cerebral edema may occur

 High altitude clubs have criticized Tanzanian authorities for charging fees for each day spent on the mountain
 isse parvatarohi samay or paisa bachaane ke liye teji se chadhaai karne ke liye protsaahit honge, jabaki uchit jalwaayu-anukulan kii maang he ki kisi bhi ucch chadhaai karne ke liye deree ko apanaaya jaataa he
 Tanzanian medical services around the mountain have recently expressed concern over the growing influx of tourists who consider Kilimanjaro apparently an easy climb
 haalanki, maamla yah nahin he
 Many individuals require significant attention during their endeavor and many are forced to abandon their ascent
 is maamle main ek jaanch ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki tanzania jane vaale paryatakon ko aksar chadhaai karne vaale samoohon main shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he bina yah bataae ki iske liye shaareerik swasthata kii anivaaryta kitni mahatvapurn he, haalanki kai saamagree vikreta or tour oparator shikhar tak pahunchane kii ucch safalataa dar kaa dikhaava karte hai
 Kilimanjaro National Park shows that only 30% of climbers actually reach the Uhru summit while most climbers return 300 meters below Uhru, at Gilman Point or 200 meters below Uhuru from Stella Point
 kilimanjaro ko aksar kam aanka jaataa he kyonki yah ek takneekee chadhaai nahin he
 However, many climbers consider Kilimanjaro to be physically very difficult climbs
 kuch logon kaa anumaan he ki mount everest kii tulana main kilimanjaro par chadhaai karte samay adhik logon ne apni jaan ganvaai he jabaki everest par apekshaakrit bahut kam parvatarohiyon ne chadhaai kaa prayaas kiya he 
 agast 2007 main ek hi saptaah ke bheetar chaar parvatarohiyon kii mrityu ho gai or is ghatana ne is baat ko or siddh kiya ki chadhaai ko laaparvaahee se nahin liya janaa chahie

 The majority of these dead are wearers who are killed by hypothermia

 For this reason, the route passing the Arrow Glacier was closed for several years
 ise haal hi main phir se kholaa gaya he, lekin park ke adhikari us maarg ko naa apnaane kii salaah dete hai or parvatarohiyon se kehete hai ki ve apni jimmedaari se us par chadhaai kar sakate hai
 To climb the Arrow Glacier route, climbers must leave early in the morning and cross the rocky surface before mid-afternoon because when the sun comes out, non-glacial rock ejaculation becomes quite common

 a large variety of wild-type vegetation is found in Kilimanjaro above the 3,000 m॰ height range, where more than 1,200 vascular tree species exist

 The low level of endemism at Kilimanjaro can lead to the destruction of low altitude forests, not the relatively young age of the mountains
 Another feature of Kilimanjaro's forests is the lack of bamboo area, which is present on all other high mountains with high rainfall, similar to East Africa
 sinarundineria alpina ko bhens or haathiyon dwaara pasand kiya jaataa he
 These killers on Kilimanjaro are found on the northern slope, where the area is dry for a long bamboo field
 unhen, nam dakshini dhaal van se sthalakriti or manushyon ke maamle main baahar rakhaa gaya he, jinhone talahati main kam se kam 2000 saal se kheti kii he
 This interaction of biological and abiotic factors may not only explain the lack of bamboo area at Kilimanjaro but may provide a possible explanation for the pattern and endemism of diversity

 shookar influenza, jise ech1en1 yaa swine flu bhi kehete hai, vibhinn shookar influenza vishaanuon main se kisi ek ke dwaara failaayaa gaya sankraman he
 The swine influenza virus is any strain of influenza virus that is responsible for endemic pigs
 2009 tak gyaat es
ai
ve upabhedon main influenza si or influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1, ech1en2, ech3en1, ech3en2 or ech2en3 shaamil hai
 This type of influenza also affects humans and birds
 shookar influenza vishaanu kaa duniya bhar ke suaro main paaya janaa aam he
 The transmission of this virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always cause human influenza, often producing only antibodies against it in the blood
 yadi iskaa sancharan, maanav influenza kaa kaaran banataa he, tab ise zunotic shookar influenza kaha jaataa he
 Individuals who are regularly exposed to pigs are at greater risk of infection with the flu
 yadi ek sankramit suar kaa maance thik se pakaaya jaye to iske seven se sankraman kaa koi khatra nahin hota
 In the mid-20th century, it became possible to identify subtypes of influenza, which led to an accurate diagnosis of its transmission in humans
 tab se aise keval 50 sancharanon kii pushti kii gai he
 These strains of swine influenza rarely transmit from one human to another
 maanav main zunotic shookar influenza ke lakshan aam influenza ke lakshanon ke samaan hi hote hai, jaise thand laganaa, bukhaar, gale main karaash, khaansi, mansapeshiyon main dard, tej sir dard, kamajori or saamaanya bechaini
 Influenza infection in pigs can cause fever, lethargy, sneeze, cough, difficulty breathing and loss of appetite

 Although death usually occurs in only 1–4% of cases
 yah sankraman boar kaa vajan gata or vikaas ko prabhavit kar saktaa he jo inke palko ke aarthik nuksaan kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 The weight of an infected pig can decrease from 5 to 6 kg over a period of 3 to 4 weeks
 manushyon main shookar influenza kaa mukhya lakshan hai: - In some cases, the transmission of the swine influenza virus is possible from pigs directly to humans, in which case it is called zoonotic swine influenza
 1958 se lekar abhi tak aise sirf 50 maamle hi report huye hai, jiname se bhi sirf 6 vyakti hi mrityu kaa grass bane hai

 Two of the three lineage influenza viruses responsible for human influenza can also spread influenza to pigs, of which influenza a is very common but influenza c is rarely found
 abhi tak influenza bi ko siiron main nahin dekha gaya he
 The strains found in humans and pigs within influenza a and influenza c differ, although re-segregation has resulted in large-scale gene transfer across strains whether present in pigs, birds, or human species
 influenza si vishaanu, maanav or siiron donon ko sankramit karata he lekin iskaa sankraman pakshiyon main nahin hota
 In the past too, it has been transmitted between pigs and humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, influenza si ke kaaran japan or california main bacchon ke bich influenza kaa kam prabhavi prakaar failaa tha
 Influenza c has not been able to cause epidemics in humans due to its limited heterogeneous range and lack of genetic diversity
 shookar influenza, influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1,ech1en2,ech3en1,ech3en2, or ech2en3
 ke kaaran hota he
 Among pigs worldwide, the three influenza a virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common
 ech1en1 spanish flu se aayaa, jo 1918 or 1919 ke dauraan faili ek mahamari thi jisase lagbhag 5 karod log maare gaye the

 Kanad saw the difference in atoms

 Presumably, the distinction of sensations inspired him to look for differences in atoms
 naveen vigyaan kahata he ki kuch tatwon ko chhod anya tatwon ke parmaanu akele nahin milte, apitu 2, 3, 4 ke samoohon main milte hai
 In Kanad's idea, making atoms also 'quadrangle' is a fundamental event in the universe, the rupture or destruction of this combination is the destruction

 1040 ) ek arab tha ganitagya, khagolvid, or islamic swarna yug ke bhautik vigyaani 
 Sometimes called the "father of modern optics", he made particularly significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception, his most influential work being written during his Kitab al-manirir, 1011–1021, in the Latin version Were left

 Ibn al-haytham first explained that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed at one's eyes
 vah is avadharana ke praarambhik samarthak bhi the ki ek pariklpana ko siddh karne yogya prakriyaaon yaa ganitiya sakshya ke aadhaar par prayogon dwaara sabit kiya janaa chahie- isliye punarjagran vaigyanikon se paanch sadiyon pehle vaigyanik vidhi ko samajhnaa
 Born in Basra, he spent most of his productive period in the capital city of Fatimid, the Cairo, and earned his living writings for teaching various texts and aristocratic members
 ebn al- hetham ko kabhi-kabhi unke janmasthan ke baad al-bari ko upnaam diya jaataa he, yaa al-miri 
 In medieval Europe, Ibn al-haytham was hailed as Ptolemaeus Secondus, or simply "physicist"
 ebn al-hetham ne bhautik prakaashiki ke aadhunik vigyaan ke liye maarg prashast kiya
 Ibn al-haytham was born in 965 AD in the city of Basra, Iraq, to an Arab family, which was at the time of the Purchaser Emirate
 unhone apane mul basra main sheershak vizir ke saath ek pad sambhala, or lagu ganit ke apane gyaan ke liye khud ke liye ek naam banaaya
 As he claimed to be able to control the floods of the Nile, he was invited by the Fatimid Caliph al-hakim to realize a hydraulic project in Aswan
 haalanki, ebn al-hetham ko apni pariyojna kii avyavhaaryata ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 On returning to Cairo, he was given an administrative post

 Legend has it that Alhazen drowned madly and was placed under house arrest during this period
 is samay ke dauraan, unhone apni prabhaavshaalee pustak of optics likhi
 Alhazen continued to live in Cairo, in the neighborhood of al-azhar's famous university, and from the income of his literary production until his death in c
 1040
 Among his students were Sokhab, a Persian from Semban, and Abu al-wafa Mubashir ibn Fateh, an Egyptian prince

 In 1834 there was work by Alhazen on geometrical subjects at the Bibliotheque Commonwealth in Paris by EA Sedillot

 Two major theories on vision prevailed in classical antiquity
 pehla siddhant, utsarjan siddhant, aise vichaarkon dwaara euclid or tolmi ke rup main samarthit tha, jo maanate the ki drushti prakaash kii kirnon ko utsarjit karti he
 The second theory, the intromission theory advocated by Aristotle and his followers, was a physical form entering the eye from an object
 pichley islamic lekhakon ne anivaary rup se eucalidian, gailenist, yaa aristotalian linon par tark diya tha
 The strongest influence on the Book of Optics was from Ptolemy's optics, while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account
 alhazen kii uplabdhi ek siddhant ke saath aana tha jisane euclid ke ganitiya re tarkon, gallen kii chikitsa parampara or aristotl ke intromishan siddhanton ko safaltaapurvak jod diya
 Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-kindi by stating that "from every point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, release light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point"
 haalanki, unhone vikiran ke kai swatantra sroton se ek susangat chhavi kaa gathan karne kii samasya ke saath use chhod diya; vishesh rup se, kisi vastu kaa har bindu ankhon par har bindu par kiran bhejtaa he
 What Alhazen needed was for each point on the object to correspond only to a point on the eye
 unhone yah kehete hue hal karne kaa prayaas kiya ki aankh keval vastu se lambavat kirnon ko samajhati he-kyonki ankhon par kisi bhi bindu par keval us kiran ko dekha jaataa he jo sidhe pahunchataa he, bina kisi aankh ke kisi anya hisse se apavartit kiye, mana janaa chahie
 He argued using a physical analogy that vertical rays were stronger than oblique rays; In the same way that a ball thrown directly on the board can break the board, while a ball thrown partially on the board will be ignored, the vertical rays were stronger than the refracted rays, and it was only the vertical rays that were seen by the eye
 Were seen
 chunki keval ek lambavat kiran thi jo kisi bhi bindu par aankh main pravesh karegi, or ye sabhi kirane shanku main aankh ke centre par ekatra ho jaaengi, isse unhen kai binduon ko bhejne ke liye kisi object kii samasya ko hal karne kii anumati mil gai
 eye; If only the perpendicular ray mattered, it had one-to-one correspondence and the illusion could be resolved
 unhone baad main jor diya ki anya kirnon ko ankhon ke madhyam se apavartit kiya jayega or mana jaataa he ki lambavat he
 His arguments about vertical rays do not clearly explain why only vertical rays were considered; Why wouldn't weak oblique rays be considered more vulnerable? His later argument that refracted rays would be considered does not appear to be perpendicular
 haalanki, isaki kamajoriyon ke baavjood, us samay kaa koi anya siddhant itnaa vyapak nahin tha, or yah vishesh rup se pashchimi europe main bahut prabhaavshaalee tha: pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se, unke di aspectibus ne 13 wein ke bich prakaashiki main adhik gatividhi ko prerit kiya or 17 veen shatabdi
 Kepler's later theory of retinal image built directly on Alhazen's conceptual framework
 alhazen ne prayog ke madhyam se dikhaaya ki prakaash sidhe sidhi rekhaon main yatra karata he, or lens, darpan, apvartan, or pratibimb ke saath vibhinn prayog kiye jate hai
 His analysis of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of different light rays
 camera aspasht pracheen chini ke liye janaa jaataa tha, or varsh 1088 sii main prakashit apni vaigyanik pustak dream pool niabandh main haan chini polimanthic pratibha shen kuo dwaara varnit kiya gaya tha
 Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his problems, although Alhazen's work also included the first explicit description outside of China of camera opacity in regions of the Middle East, Europe, Africa, and India
 or divaais ke shuruaati vishleshan 
 Alhazen studied the process of vision, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the visual system
 ian pi
 Howard argued in a 1996 Assumption article that Alhazen should be credited with the many discoveries and theories that were first attributed to Western Europeans centuries later
 udhaaharan ke liye, unhone varnan kiya ki 19 veen shatabdi main samaan sangrakshan ke hering ke kanoon main kya hua
 He wrote a description of the vertical horizon 600 years before Agilonius — which is actually closer to the modern definition than Agilonius — and his work on binocular inequality was repeated by Panem in 1858
 craig aayan-stockdel, sahamat he ki alhasen ko shrey diya janaa chahie kai pragati ke saath, kuch saavdhaanee baratani he, khaskar jab allesson ko tolmi se algaav main vichaar karte hue, jo alhasen behad parichit the
 Alhazen corrected a critical error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Herring's law
 aam taur par, alhazen ne tolemi ke prakaashiki kaa nirmaan or vistaar kiya
 In a more detailed account of Ibn al-haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision, based on Lejeune and Sabra, Raynaud showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and cross diplopia were in place in Ibn al-haytham's optics
 lekin harvard ke vipareet, unhone samajhaayaa ki kyon ebn al-hetham ne bhayanak ke golakaar aankade nahin die or kyon, prayogtmak tark ke kaaran, ve vastav main viyat-muller sarkal kii tulana main panem ke sanlayan kshetra kii khoj ke kareeb the
 In this regard, Ibn al-haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limitations: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and the lack of experimental investigation of the ostensibly ocular tract
 alhasen kaa sabase mul yogadan yah tha ki unhone yah sochane ke baad ki kaise ankhon ko rachanaatmak rup se banaaya gaya tha, unhone vichaar kiya ki yah sharir rachanaatmak rup se ek optical system ke rup main kaise kaary karegi
 His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments has influenced his view of image deviations in the eye, which he sought to avoid
 unhone kaha ki lens par lambavat kirnon ko aage badhaayaa gaya tha kyonki unhone himand vinod choda tha or parinamswaroop chhavi aankh ke peeche optic tantrika main sidhe ho gai thi 
 He believed Galen to believe that the lens was the receptive organ of vision, although some of his works indicate that he thought the retina was also involved

 One aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research concerns the systematic and methodological dependence on experimentation and controlled testing in his scientific inquiry
 iske alaava, unke prayogtmak nirdesh shastreey bhautikee ko ganit ke saath sanyojit karne par vishram karte the 
 This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his proposals in Kitab al-manazir and gave the basis for his theories of vision, light and color as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics
 mathius shraam ke mutabik, alhazen "ek prayog main ek prayogtmak paristhitiyon main bhinnata ke tareeke kaa vyavasthit upyog karne vaala pehla vyakti tha, jisamen ek prayog main dikhaaya gaya tha ki prakaash prakshepan kii tivrata ke prakshepan dwaara gathit screen par do chote epperchar ke madhyam se chandani lagaataar kam ho jaati he kyonki epperchar main se ek dhire-dhire avaruddh ho jaataa he
 GJ Toomer voiced some skepticism about Schram's idea, arguing that Alhazen's very large body of work requires caution to avoid reading unethically particular passages, because at the time, his book Optics Yet Was not fully translated from Arabic
 prayogtmak takneekon ke vikaas main alhasen ke mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue, tumer ne tark diya ki alhazan ko anya islamic or pracheen vichaarkon se algaav main nahin mana janaa chahie
 Toomer acknowledges that "schramm refers to the achievement in the development of scientific method
 " tumer 1964 kii suchi, purv shart ke rup main, itihaaskaaron ke liye shraam ke daawey kii jaanch karne ke liye kya aavashyak he ki ebn al-hetham aadhunik bhautikee ke sachche sansthaapak the, ebn al-hetham ke anuwaad hai
 Mark Smith recalled Aljazen's elaboration of Ptolemy's experiments in dual vision, reflection, and refraction: Alhazen's optics book influenced perspectives in Europe, Roger Bacon, Vitello, and Peckham

 His work on catatoprix in Book v of the Book of Optics now includes a discussion of what is known as the Elzen problem, first formulated by Ptolemy in 150 AD
 isamen paridhi par ek bindu par sarkal meeting ke vimaan main do binduon se rekhachitr rekhaaen hoti hai or us bindu par saamaanya ke saath samaan kone banaate hai
 This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular billiard table at which a player must aim for a cue ball at a given point so that it bounces off the table edge and hits another ball at the other end

 Alhazen eventually solved the problem using conic squares and a geometric proof
 unka samaadhaan behad lanbaa or jatil tha or ganitagyon ne latin anuwaad main unhen padhakar samajha nahin tha
 Later mathematicians used Descartes's analytical methods to analyze the problem, in 1997 Oxford mathematician Peter M

 Recently, researchers from Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories Amit Aggarwal, Yuichi Taguchi, and Srikumar Ramalingam solved the problem of alphazen in common rotational symmetric quadrilateral mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptical mirrors
 unhone dikhaaya ki darpan pratibimb bindu kii gananaa sabase saamaanya maamle main aathvin degree sameekaran ko hal karke kii ja sakati he
 If the camera is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of equation becomes six
 alphazan kii samasya ko golakaar gend se kai apvartanon tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Given a spherical ball of a light source and some refractive index, the nearest point on the spherical ball where the illuminator is refracted into the observer's eye can be obtained by solving the tenth degree equation

 They conducted experiments with projectiles and concluded that the effect of vertical projectiles on surfaces was sufficient to penetrate them only, while surfaces forced the removal of oblique projectile strikes
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek durlabh se ghaney madhyam se apvartan kii vyakhya karne ke liye, usne ek dhaatu shit main ek vistrut chhed ko dhankate hue ek patali slate par phenkane vaali louh gend ke yantric samanta kaa upyog kiya
 a vertical throw breaks the slate and passes, while one is not skewed by equal force and equal distance
 unhone yah parinaam yah bhi bataaya ki yantric yantric samanta kaa upyog karke kitni gahan, sidhi roshni aankh ko dard detii he: alhasen lambavat kirnon or 'kamjor' roshni ke saath 'majboot' roshni se judi hoti he
 The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and eyes was in the choice of the vertical ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object can enter the eye

 The Khalifa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the "founder of psychology", a pioneer of sub-discipline and modern psychology
 haalanki alhasen ne drushti ke bare main kai vyaktiparak report kii, lekin is baat kaa koi saboot nahin he ki unhone maatraatmak manovigyaan takneekon kaa upyog kiya or daawa ko asweekaar kar diya gaya he

 Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's theory of refraction, and purportedly defined the problem, rather than the real, detail
 unhone kaha ki kisi vastu kii duuri kaa nirdhaaran karne par vastu or paryvekshak ke bich hastkshep nikaayon ke nirbaadh anukram hone par nirbhar karata he
 When the Moon is high in the sky there are no interfering objects, so the Moon is seen close by
 nirantar koniya aakaar kii vastu kaa anumaanit aakaar isaki anumaanit duuri ke saath bhinn hota he
 Therefore, the moon appears closer and smaller in the sky, and farther and larger on the horizon

 Although Alhazen is often credited with an approximate distance explanation, he was not the first author to introduce it
 chlomedes ne is khate ko diya, or unhone ise posidonius main shrey diya
 Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his optics, but the text is unclear
 in purv lekhakon kii tulana main madhya yug main alhazen ke lekhan adhik vyapak rup se uplabdh the, or shaayad yah bataate hai ki alhasen ko credit kyon mila
 Optical texts In addition to the book of optics, Alhazen wrote several other texts on the same subject, including his Risla fi-don '

 In his al-shukq 'al Battalamuiy, translated as Ptmets against Ptolemy about Ptolemy or Aphorias, published sometime between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized Ptolemy's Almagest, Planetary Hypotheses and Optics, in which he Pointed out these various contradictions especially in astronomy works
 tolmi ke almaguest grahon kii gati ke sambandh main ganitiya siddhanton se sambandhit the, jabaki pariklpanaaon ne chintit tha ki tolemi vichaar grahon kii vaastavik concigareshan thi
 Ptolemy himself admitted that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided there were no noticeable errors, but in criticism of the contradictions inherent in Alhazen Ptolemy's works Were particularly concerned
 unhone mana ki kuch ganitiya upkaran tolemi khagol vigyaan main pesh kiye gaye hai, khaastaur par baraabar, samaan paripatr gati kii shaareerik aavashyaktaa ko puraa karne main naakaam rahe, or kaalpanik ganitiya binduon, rekhaon or mandaliyon ko vaastavik bhautik gati se sambandhit betukapan kaa ullekh kiya: Ptolemy assumed an arrangement that could not exist, and the fact that this arrangement originates in his imagination does not relieve the planetary motion from the error he made in his approximate arrangement, because of the prevailing motion For planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist 


 or a man to imagine a circle in heaven, and to imagine For the planet moving in the planet does not bring the motion of the planet
