 Mahatma Gandhi spoke to the Viceroy on 17 February 1931 to pardon the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, then on 18 February 1931, on behalf of the general public, also filed an appeal before the Viceroy for forgiveness with various arguments
 yah sab kuch bhagat singh kii ichha ke khilaaf ho rahaa tha kyon ki bhagat singh nahin chaahate the ki unki sajaa maaf kii jaae

33 pm in the evening

 It is said that when the officials of the jail informed them that the time had come for their execution, they had said- "stop! First, meet one revolutionary other
 " phir ek minute baad kitaab chat kii ore oochaal kar bole - "thik he ab chalo
 " phaansi par jate samay ve teenon masti se ga rahe the - Fearing that no movement could erupt after the hanging, the British first sliced their dead bodies, then filled them in sacks and took them to Ferozepur where they were burnt by adding kerosene instead of ghee

 Fearing this, the British threw half of their dead bodies into the Sutlej River and ran away

 And Bhagat Singh became immortal forever

 He also thought of the attack of an Indian on the weaker section of society in the same manner as the atrocities committed by an Englishman
 bhagat singh ko hindi, urdu, punjabi tathaa angreji ke alaava bangla bhi aati thi jo unhone batukeshwar dutt se sikhi thi
 He believed that his martyrdom would cause the Indian public to become more agitated and this could hardly happen with his life

 unhone angrej sarkaar ko ek patr bhi likhaa, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki unhen angrezi sarkaar ke kilaaf bharatiyon ke yuddh kaa pratik ek yudhbandi samajha jaye tathaa phaansi dene ke bajaay goli se uda diya jaye

 There is a district of Gorkha in Nepal, that district is also named after Gorkha

 In this passage, the earlier siddhas have also been inserted later and hence there are dozens of such legends regarding Gorakhnath, which, assuming historical facts, cause date-related problems

 The world of Mahadevi Varma is very wide
 jisamen gadhy, padya, chitrakala or bal sahitya sabhi samaae hue hai
 Her creation also spans over 50 years and she continued to create something until her last time
 is lekh main unki lagbhag samast rachanaaon ko sammilit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 Mahadevi Varma has eight poetry collections - iske atirikt kuch aise kavy sankalan bhi prakashit hai, jinamein uparyukt rachanaaon main se chune hue geet sankalit kiye gayi hai, jaise 1
 atmika, 2
nirantara, 3
parikrama, 4

 Children's literature has also been created with his pen
 unka pehla geet kavy sangrah he
 Songs composed from 1924 to 1928 are stored in this collection
 nihar kii vishaywastu ke sambandh main swayan mahadevi verma kaa kathan ullekhneey he- "nihar ke rachana kaal main meri anubhutiyon main waisi hi kautuhal mishrit vednaa umad aati thi, jaise balak ke man main dur dikhaayi dene vaali aprapya sunahali ushaa or sparsh se dur sajal megh ke pratham darshan se utpann ho jaati he
 "these songs have been a natural expression of curiosity mixed anguish
 rashmi mahadevi verma kaa doosraa kavita sangrah he
 It contains compositions from 1927 to 1931
 isamen mahadevi ji kaa chintan or darshan paksh mukhar hota prathit hota he
 Therefore, there is more of philosophical thinking and deliberation than feeling
 main rashmi kaa chintan or darshan adhik spasht or praudh hota he
 The poetess feels joy in pain and pain while coordinating happiness and sorrow
 vah us saamanjasypurna bhavbhumi main pahunch gai hai, jahaan dukh sukh ekaakaar ho jate hai or vednaa kaa madhur ras hi uski samarasata kaa aadhaar ban jaataa he
 This harmonious feeling in the evening song makes it even more mature and serene, bringing the seeker so close to the beloved that she begins to understand the distance between her and the beloved
 main 1934 se 1936 i0 tak ke rachit geet hai
 In these songs, Neerja's expressions get a ripe form
 yahan na keval sukh-dukh kaa balki ansu or vednaa, milan or virah, aashaa or niraashaa evam bandhan-mukti aadi kaa samanvay he
 Deepshikha has songs from 1936 to 1942 AD
 is sangrah ke geeton kaa mukhya pratipaadya swayan mitkar duusare ko sukhi bananaa he
 This is the poetry of the perfection of Mahadevi, in which the lamp of the seeker's soul is unimpressed and unmoved and merges into the unbroken light of the adorable
 main mahadevi kii antim dinon main rachi gayin rachanaayen sangrahit hai jo pathakon ko abhibhoot bhi karengi or aashcharyachakit bhi, is arth main ki mahadevi kavy main ot-prot vednaa or karunaa kaa vah swar, jo kab se unki pahchaan ban chukaa he
 Many compositions have been written in 'agni Rekha', considering the lamp as a symbol
 saath hi anek vishyon par bhi kavitaayen hai
 The official theme of the songs of Mahadevi Varma in Deepshikha is 'prem'
 par prem kii sarthakata unhone milan ke ullaspurn kshanon se adhik virah kii pidaa main talash kii he
 In Saptaparna, Mahadevi with his cultural consciousness has presented Hindi poetry of 39 selected important parts by establishing the identity of Vedas, Ramayana, Ther saga, Ashwaghosh, Kalidas, Bhavabhuti and Jayadeva
 aarambh main 61 prishthiya ‘apni baat’ main unhone bhartiya manisha or sahitya kii is amuly dharohar ke sambandh main gahan shodhapurna vimarsh bhi prastut kiya he
 Jayadev is revered by Mahadevi Varma on the seventh step after 'arashvani, Valmiki, Theragatha, Ashwaghosh, Kalidas and Bhavabhuti under' Saptaparna '
 unhone bataaya he ki jayadev kaa jab aavirbhaav hua tab sanskrit ke shringaari kavy ke nayak-nayika ke rup main radhakrishna kii pratishtha ho chuki thi
 


 Mahadevi ji while presenting poetry in selected sections of Sanskrit and Pali literature in 'saptaparna' has kept his vision focused on the history of Indian contemplation and tradition of aesthetics
 unki yah kriti unhen ek safal srujanaatmak kavyanuvadak, saahityetihaaskaar tathaa samskruti-chintak ke rup main pratishthit karne main purna samarth he, isamen andeh nahin
 Neehar is the creation of the bright times of life, in which Satya seems seductive and curious even while hiding in the sky
 'rashmi' yuvavastha ke praarambhik dinon kii rachana he
 When the rays of truth ignite the flame of knowledge in the soul
 'neeraja' kavyitri kii praudh maansik sthiti kii kriti he, jisamen din ke ujjwal prakaash main kamalini kii tarah vah apane sadhana maarg par apana saurabh bikharaa detii hai
 In the 'sandhyagita', along with the compassion and compassion of the evening of life, the soul's tendency to return to its spiritual home is present
 'deepashikha' main raat ke shant, snigdh or shunya vaataavaran main aradhy ke sammukh jivan deep ke jalte rahane kii bhaavana pramukh he
 In this way, he divided the Ahorarat of his life into these five symbolic titles and made it clear the point of his spiritual practice
 vednaa kii is ekant sadhana ke falswaroop mahadevi kii kavita main vishyon kaa vaividhya bahut kam he
 There are only a few of his poems in which national and cultural discourse or independent portrayal of nature has been done
 shesh sabhi kavitaaon main vishaywastu or drushtikon ek hi hone ke kaaran unki kavyabhumi vistrut nahin ho saki hai
 This has caused both loss and gain to his poetry
 haani yah hui he ki vishay parivartan na hone se unke samast kavy main ekresata or bhavavriti bahut adhik he
 The advantage has been that within the limited area, the poet has depicted many dimensions of the sensations from several perspectives by looking at their microcosmic distinctions in front of them
 is tarah unke kavy main vistaargat vishalata or darshanagat gurutv bhale hi na mili, par unki bhaawanaaon kii gambhirtha, anubhutiyon kii sookshmata, bimbon kii spashtataa or kalpana kii kamaniyata ke falswaroop ganbhiry or mahatta avashya he
 In this way, his poetic expansion is not a poem of depth
 mahadevi kaa kavy varnanaatmak or itivrittatmak nahin hai
 He has expressed inner subtle feelings in the form of innate sensations
 is kaaran unki abhivyanjana paddati main lakshanikta or vyanjaktaa kaa bahulya he
 The seductive images he presents with metaphorical images and symbols reveal his subtle vision and power of colorful imagination
 ye chitra unhone apane pariparshv, visheshkar prakritik parivesh se liye hai par prakruti ko unhone alamban rup main bahut kam grahan kiya
 Prakriti has always been depicted in his poetry only in the form of stimulation, ornamentation, symbol and symbol
 isi kaaran prakruti ke ati parichit or sarvajansulabh drishyon yaa vastuon ko hi unhone apane kavy kaa upadan banaaya hai
 His extraordinary and understated scenes have gone unnoticed
 phir bhi simit prakritik upaadaanon ke dwaara unhone jo purna yaa aanshik bimb chitrit kiye hai, unase unki chitravidhaayini kalpana kaa puraa parichay mil jaataa he
 The philosophy of this imagination is also seen in his paintings, which he has created not through words but through colors and paintbrush
 unke ye chitra 'deepashikha' or 'yama' main kavitaaon ke saath prakashit hue hai
 Mahadevi Varma has written- 'those who touch the philosopher of art have no name other than artist, no class other than seeker, no capital other than truth, no business other than sentiment and none other than welfare
 Not profit
 ' lekhan-avadhi main unhone ekanishtha hokar abaadh-gati se bhavamay srijan or karmmay jivan kii sadhana main likhi hui baat ko sarthak banaaya
 There is a Mahadevi who has also realized the heart of poetry in prose and has made a proclamation of 'prose Kavinam Nikshman Vadanti'
 vilakshan baat to yah he ki na to unhone upanyaas likhaa, na kahani, na hi naatak phir bhi shreshth gadhykar hai
 His writings include sketches, memoirs or travelogue on the one hand and editorials, roles, essays and address on the other hand, but all of them have diversified life as a whole
 bina kalpanashrith kavy roopon kaa sahaara liye koi rachanaakaar gadhy main itnaa kuch arjeet kar saktaa he, yah mahadevi ko padhakar hi janaa ja saktaa he
 Like Chandrakanta Mani in Hindi literature, Mahadevi Varma, the goddess of the volatile Karun Rasa, is not only a distinguished artist, poetess and prose writer, but is also an outstanding essayist
 unka gadhy kavita kii bhaanti saundarya ke bhulaave main daalkar hamen jivan se dur nahin le jaataa, vah to hamaari shiraaon main chetana bharkar hamen yatharth jivan main jhaankne kii prerana pradaan karata he
 Lines of Smriti and constant curiosity in the movie of the past, Sheel Mahadevi has immortalized those characters by portraying various forms of life very tenderly by indelible lines based on Smriti
 inamen gaanv, ganwai ke nirdhan, vipann log, balvidhwaaon, vimaataaon, punarvivaahitaaon tathaa kathith bhrashtaon or vruddh-vivaah ke kaaran prataditaaon ke atyant shashakt evam karun chitra he
 Mahadevi has rightly depicted not only women but also neglected men
 rama, ghisa, alopi or badalu aadi ke rekhachitr unke asaadhaaran maanavtawaad kii ore ingit karte hai
 Mahadevi has depicted the characteristics, weaknesses and problems of lower class characters in most of his drawings
 sevak rama kii vatsalyapurna seva, bhangin sabia kii pati-parayanata or sahansheeltaa, ghisa kii nishchal gurubhakti, saag-bhaaji ke vikreta andhe alopi kaa saral vyaktitv, kumbhakaar badalu tathaa radhiva kaa saral daanpaty prem, pahaad kii ramani lakshamaa kaa mahadevi ke prati anupam sneh-bhav, vruddh bhakthin kii pragalbhta tathaa swami-bhakthi, chini yuvak kii karun-maarmik jivan-gaatha, parvaty kuli jangbahadur tathaa uske anuj dhaniya kii karmthata aadi anek vishyon ko rekhachitron main sthaan diya he
 Mahadevi has presented all the memorabilia from within her life, so it is only natural that various events of her own life and various parts of her character have got place
 unhone apni anubhutiyon ko jyon kaa tyon yatharth rup main ankit kiya he
 It is worth mentioning here that the element of characterization has been prominent in Mahadevi's sketches, the story has appeared in her embrace
 unke in rekhachitron main gambhir lok kaa bhi paryaapt samavesh hua he
 In 'path Ke Saathi', Mahadevi portrays her contemporary creators
 jis sammaan or atmiyatapurna dhang se unhone in sahityakaron kaa jivan-darshan or swabhaavgat mahanata ko sthapit kiya he vah apane aap main badi uplabdhi he
 There are also memoirs in 'path's companions' and the life pages of poets read by Mahadevi
 unhone ek ore sahityakaron kii nikatataa, atmiyata or prabhaav kaa kaavyatmak ullekh kiya he or duusari ore unke samgr jivan darshan ko parakhane kaa praytn kiya he
 In the 'path of Saathi' the lines of Kavindra Ravindra, Dadda, Prasad, Nirala, Pant, Subhadrakumari Chauhan and Siyaramsharan Gupta have come in the form of word-pictures
 shrunkhlaa kii kadiyaan' main saamaajik samasyaon, vishesh kar abhishpt nari jivan ke jalte prashnon ke sambandhon main likhe unke vichaaratmak niabandh sankalit hai
 Apart from creative prose, 'critical prose of Mahadevi' and his critical talent in the roles of 'deepshikha', 'vama' and 'modern poet- Mahadevi' can be easily realized

 Puri region of the erstwhile Indian state of Orissa, also known as Purushottam Puri, Shankh Kshetra, Srikshetra, is the main pastime of Lord Shri Jagannath
 utkal pradesh ke pradhan devtaa shri jagannatha ji hi maane jate hai
 Vaishnavism here believes that the symbol of the couple idol of Radha and Shri Krishna is Sri Jagannathji himself
 isi pratik ke rup shri jagannatha se sampoorn jagat kaa udbhav hua he
 Shri Jagannath ji is the perfect God and Lord Krishna is a form of his art

 The amazing Sun Temple of Konark, the dhaul-giri and uday-giri Caves adorned with the unique idols of Lord Buddha, the Tapasthi khand-giri Caves of Jain sages, ling-raj, Sakshi Gopal and the temple of Lord Jagannath are worth visiting
 puri or chandrabhaga kaa manoram samudri kinaaraa, chandan talab, janakapur or nandankanan abhyaaran bada hi manoram or darshneey he
 The importance of Rath Yatra has also been accepted in the scriptures and Puranas
 skanda puraana main spasht kaha gaya he ki rath-yatra main jo vyakti shri jagannatha ji ke naam kaa kirthan karata hua gundia nagar tak jaataa he vah punarjanm se mukt ho jaataa he
 Those who visit Shri Jagannath ji and bow down in the dust and mud of the road while bowing, they go directly to the best abode of Lord Shri Vishnu
 jo vyakti gundicha mandap main rath par virajman shri krishna, balram or subhadra devi ke darshan dakshin disha ko aate hue karte hai ve moksh ko praapt hote hai
 The Rath Yatra is a festival in which Lord Jagannath comes to the public 7 times and participates in his happiness and sorrow
 sab manisa mor parja, ye unke udgaar he
 Lord Jagannath is Purushottam
 unamem shriram, shrikrishna, buddha, mahayan kaa shunya or advait kaa brahm samahit he

 Balabhadra ji's chariot to Taladhwaj and Subhadra ji's chariot are somewhat smaller than the chariot of Devallan Jagannath
 sandhyaa tak ye teenon hi rath mandir main ja pahonchte hai
 The next day, Lord gets off the chariot and enters the temple and stays there for seven days
 gundia mandir main in nau dinon main shri jagannatha ji ke darshan ko aadap-darshan kaha jaataa he
 Prasad of Shri Jagannath ji is considered as Mahaprasad while Prasad of other pilgrimages is generally called Prasad
 shri jagannatha ji ke prasad ko mahaprasad kaa swaroop mahaprabhu ballabhacharya ji ke dwaara mila
 It is said that to test the loyalty of Mahaprabhu Ballabhacharya, when he reached Puri on the day of Ekadashi fast, someone gave a prasad in the temple itself
 mahaprabhu ne prasad haath main lekar stvan karte hue din ke baad raatri bhi bitaa di
 On the next day Dwadashi received the Prasad at the end of the eulogy and that Prasad got the glory of Mahaprasad

 Lord Jagannath becomes ill after eating good dishes at his aunt's house
 tab yahan pathya kaa bhoga lagaaya jaataa he jisase bhagwaan sheeghra thik ho jate hai
 On the third day of Rath Yatra, on the fifth day, Lakshmi comes here to seek Lord Jagannath
 tab dwaitapati daravaaza band kar dete hai jisase lakshmi ji naaraaz hokar rath kaa pahiyaa tod detii he or hera gohiri saahi puri kaa ek muhalla jahaan lakshmi ji kaa mandir he, vahaan laut jaati hai
 Later Lord Jagannath goes to celebrate Lakshmi
 unase kshamaa mangekar or anek prakaar ke uphaar dekar unhen prasann karne kii koshish karte hai
 In this event, on the one hand, the ambassador talks in the role of Lord Jagannath, on the other hand, Devadasi talks in the role of Lakshmi ji
 logon kii apaar bheed is maan-manouvval ke samvaad ko sunakar khushi se jhum uthati hai
 The whole sky echoes with the slogan of Shri Jagannath
 lakshmi ji ko bhagwaan jagannatha ke dwaara manaa liye jane ko vijay kaa pratik maanakar is din ko vijayadashami or vaapasi ko bohtadi goncha kaha jaataa he
 The rath yatra sees an amazing harmony of traditional harmony, cultural unity and religious tolerance
 shri jagannatha ji kii rathyatra main bhagwaan shri krishna ke saath radha yaa rukmini nahin hotin balki balram or subhadra hote hai
 Her story is somewhat like this - In Dwarka, while sleeping with Rajkumar Rukmini etc
 Raj Mahisis, one night they suddenly spoke radhe-radhe in sleep
 maharaniyon ko aashcharya hua
 On awakening, Sri Krishna did not allow his sentiment to appear, but Rukmini talks to the other queens that, hearing that there is a gopakumari named Radha in Vrindavan, which the Lord has not forgotten for all of us even after devotion and devotion
 radha kii shrikrishna ke saath rahasyatmak raas lilaon ke bare main mata rohinee bhalee prakaar jaanati thim
 All the nobles pleaded to get information from them
 pehle to mata rohinee ne taalna chaha lekin maharaniyon ke hath karne par kaha, thik he
 Listen, put Subhadra at the first guard, no one should come in, even if it is Balarama or Shri Krishna
 mata rohinee ke katha shuru karte hi shri krishna or balram achaanak ant:poor kii ore aate dikhaai die
 Subhadra stopped at the door after giving proper reasons
 ant:poor se shrikrishna or radha kii raasalila kii vaarta shrikrishna or balram dono ko hi sunai di
 Hearing him, the amazing love juice started to appear in the limbs of Shri Krishna and Balarama
 saath hi subhadra bhi bhav vihval hone lageen
 It was such a situation for all three that even after looking carefully, the hands and feet of anyone did not look clear
 sudarshan chakra vigalit ho gaya
 He assumed a long shape
 yah mata radhika ke mahabhaav kaa gauravpurn drishy tha
 Suddenly the arrival of Narada, the three of them vowed

 Vishwakarma himself presented himself as an old carpenter when the king decided to build a Vishnu statue from him
 unhone murti banane ke liye ek shart rakhi ki main jis ghar main murti banaaunga usamen murti ke purnroopen ban jane tak koi na aae
 The king accepted it
 aaj jis jagah par shrijagannatha ji kaa mandir he usee ke paas ek ghar ke andar ve murti nirmaan main lag gaye
 The family of the king was not known who the old carpenter was
 kai din tak ghar kaa dwaar band rahane par maharani ne sochaa ki bina khaae-piye vah badhai kaise kaam kar sakegaa
 By now he must have either lived or died
 maharani ne maharaja ko apni sahaj shankaa se avgat karavaaya

 She lives in another city by the name of Shivangi
 samar gauri se nafrat karte rahata he
 Because she feels that her mother is murdered by Gauri
 anupam kii bahan nisha aati he
 And Anupam is paralyzed, because Ipshita wanted to kill him to be with Shiva
 nisha is baat kaa badla kapur ke parivaar se lenaa chaahati he
 She considers the family responsible for her brother's condition
 nisha samar ko apni jaal main fasaa kar usase sagaai kar leti he
 Meanwhile, Gauri's memory returns

 She kidnaps Nisha on Samar and Nisha's wedding day
 shaadi ho jaati he lekin jab vah dekhtaa he kii vah nisha nahin gauri he to vah chaunk jaataa he

 He is cured by his friend Prateek
