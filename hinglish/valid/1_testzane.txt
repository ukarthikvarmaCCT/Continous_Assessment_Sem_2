 Uranium mining is the process of extracting uranium ore from the ground
 2015 main duniya bhar main uranium kaa utpaadan 60,496 ton hua tha
 Around three per cent of the world's production is done in three countries - Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia
 in teen deshon ke alaava ek hajaar ton utpaadan karne vaale deshon main niger, rus, namibia, uzbekistan, china, sanyukt raashtra or ukraine hai
 Uranium obtained from mining is used almost entirely as fuel in nuclear plants

 Uranium was discovered in the year 1789, but miners had already seen uranium ore
 uranium kaa oxide jo raal jaisi vastuon main paaya jaataa he, ke bare main crusane hori ne varsh 1565 main bataaya tha
 After this and before its discovery, ore was found in 1727 in Jachimov and 1763 in Schwarzwald
 unnisvin sadi main uranium ayask bohemia or cornaval main khanan karne se praapt hota tha
 Knowing for the first time, its mining work was done in Jachimov

 samaajwaad ek aarthik-saamaajik darshan he
 In the socialist system, the ownership and distribution of wealth is subject to the control of society
 aarthik, saamaajik or vaicharik pratyay ke taur par samaajwaad nijee sampatti par aadhaarit adhikaron kaa virodh karata he
 One of its basic pledges is that the production and distribution of wealth should be in the hands of society or the state
 raajnneeti ke aadhunik arthon main samaajwaad ko poonjeewaad yaa mukt bazaar ke siddhant ke vipareet dekha jaataa he
 Socialism as a political ideology has developed in the interplay of industrialization that emerged in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
 british raajnneetik vigyaani harold loski ne kabhi samaajwaad ko ek aisi topi kaha tha jise koi bhi apane anusaar pahan letaa he
 Different varieties of socialism shape this depiction of Lasky to a great extent

 The suffix emanating from the political thought and practice of Ram Manohar Lohia, Jai Prakash Narayan and Narendra Dev is called 'gandhian Socialism'
 samaajwaad angreji or francisi shabd 'socialism' kaa hindi roopaantar he
 In the first half of the 19th century the term was used in opposition to individualism and in support of ideas that aimed to change the economic and moral basis of society and wanted to establish social control rather than individual control in life
 samaajwaad shabd kaa prayog anek or kabhi kabhi paraspar virdohi prasangon main kiya jaataa he; jaise samoohwaad araajaktaavaad, adikalin kabyli samyawad, sainya samyawad, isai samaajwaad, sahakaaritavaad, aadi - yahan tak ki natsi dal kaa bhi puraa naam 'rashtriya samaajawaadee dal' tha
 Socialism is difficult to define
 yah siddhant tathaa andolan, donon hi he or yah vibhinn aitihaasik or sthaneey paristhitiyon main vibhinn rup dhaaran karata he
 Essentially it is the movement that strives to establish a classless society based on the socialization of the main means of production and which makes the working class its mainstay, as it considers this class to be the exploited class whose historical work is to end the class system is
 adikalin samyavaadee samaaj main manushya parsparik sahyog dwaara aavashyak chizon kii prapti or prayek sadsy ke aavashyaktaanusaar unka aapas main bantwaaraa karte the
 But this communism was natural; Was not based on the conscious imagination of man
 aarambh ke isai padariyon kii rahan-sahan kaa dhang bahut kuch samyavaadee tha, ve ek saath or samaan rup se rahete the, parantu unki aay kaa strot dharmavalambiyon kaa daan tha or unka adarsh jansadharan ke liye nahin, varan keval padariyon tak simit tha
 Their purpose was also spiritual, not physical
 yahi baat madhyakaalin isai samyawad ke sambandh main bhi sahi he
 The ancient Inca civilization of the country of Peeru is called 'military communism', but its base was military organization and the system used to benefit the ruling class
 nagarpalikaon dwaara loksevaon ke sadhano ko praapt karnaa, athwa desh kii unnati ke liye aarthik yojanaon ke prayog maatr ko samaajwaad nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki yah aavashyak nahin ki inke dwaara poonjeewaad ko thes pahunche
 The Natsi party nationalized the banks, but the capitalist system remained intact
 samaajwaad kaa bhaavnaatmak dhaanchaa gadhane main england main satrahavin sadi ke dauraan isiyat ke daayre main viksit levelors tathaa diggars va solahavin or satrahavin sadi main madhya europe main viksit hone vaale ainabaptist jaise radical andolanon kii mahati bhoomika rahi he
 But the modern and formal hypothesis of socialism derives from the conclusions of French thinkers san-simons and Charles Furie and the British thinker Robert Owen
 samaajwaad ke ye shuruaati vichaarak vyaktvaad or pratisparddha kii jagah aapasi sahyog par aadhaarit samaaj kii kalpana karte the
 He believed that the social fabric could be given a better shape by creating a science of human nature and society
 parantu vaanchit saamaajik roopon ke thos byoron, unhen praapt karne kii ranneeti tathaa maanav prakruti kii samaj ko lekar unke bich kai tarah ke matbhed the
 For example, san-simo and Furie did not agree with Rousseau's view that human nature is good, sublime and rational in its design, but modern society and private property have corrupted it
 iske virodh main unka tark yah tha ki maanviya prakruti ke kuch sthir or nishchit rup hote hai jinka paraspar sahyog ke aadhaar par aapas main mail karaayaa ja saktaa he
 Owen's opinion was also different from sans-sims and furries
 unka kahana tha ki manushya kii prakruti bahari paristhitiyon se tay hoti he or use icchit rup diya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the conditions of society should be changed in such a way that the nature of human beings can move towards perfection
 unke anusaar agar pratisparddha or vyaktvaad kii jagah aapasi sahyog or ekta ko badhaava diya jayega to samoochee manushyata kaa bhala kiya ja saktaa he
 The political ideology of socialism began to become popular in European countries such as England, France and Germany during the third and fourth decades of the nineteenth century
 udyogikaran or shaharikaran kii tej gati tathaa parmparik samaaj ke avsaan ne europee samaaj ko sudhaar or badlaav kii shaktiyon kaa akhaada bana diya tha jisamen majdoor sanghon or charteravaadi samoohon se lekar aise gut sakriy the jo aadhunik samaaj kii jagah prak-aadhunik saamudayikthawaad kii vakaalat kar rahe the
 The idea of scientific socialism propounded by Marx and Engels developed in this background of social and political turmoil
 marks ne sain-simon, furiye or oven ke vichaaron se prerana to lee, lekin apane ‘vaigyanik’ samaajwaad ke mukaable unke samaajwaad ko ‘kaalpanik’ ghoshit kar diya
 Marx, like these earlier thinkers, does not consider socialism as an ideal to draw a clear vision of it
 marks or angels samaajwaad ko kisi swayan-bhu siddhant ke bajaay poonjeewaad kii karypranali se utpann hone vaali sthiti ke rup main dekhte hai
 He believed that any form of socialism would emerge from the historical process itself
 is samaj ke chalate marks or angels ko samaajwaad kii vistrut vyakhya karne yaa use paribhaashit karne se bhi gurez tha
 For him, socialism was mainly a suffix in denial of capitalism, which had to forge its own identity through a long revolutionary process
 samaajwaad ke vishay main marks kii sabase mahatvapurn rachana 'critic of da gotha program' he jisamen unhone samaajwaad ko samyavaadee samaaj ke do charnon kii madhyavarti avasthaa ke taur par vyakhyayit kiya he
 It is worth mentioning that this work of Marx was published eight years after his death
 tab tak marxvaadi siddhanton main ise zyaada mahatva nahin diya jaataa tha
 The credit for incorporating this discourse into the core principles of Marxism goes to Lenin, who, in his work 'state and Revolution', quoted Marx as describing socialism as the first or lower stage in the creation of communist society
 lenin ke baad samaajwaad marxvaadi shabdaawalee main is tarah vinyast ho gaya ki koi bhi vyakti yaa dal kisi khaas vaicharik dikkat ke bina khud ko samaajawaadee yaa samyavaadee kah saktaa tha
 The dividing line of this discussion was determined by what was the immediate and far-reaching goal of revolutionary activities for a party or individual
 yani agar koi khud ko samaajawaadee kahata tha to iskaa matlab yah hota tha ki vah samyavaadee samaaj kii rachana ke pehle charan par jor detaa he
 This is the reason that when the ruling parties in many socialist countries declared themselves as Communists, it was not considered inconsistent
 beesvin shatabdi main samaajwaad kaa antarrashtriya prasar tathaa soviet shashan vyavastha ek tarah se sahavarti parighatnaayen maani jaati hai
 This is a fact which has deeply influenced the idea of socialism and its future
 udaahranarth, kranti ke baad soviet sangh uske samarthakon or aalochakon, donon ke liye samaajwaad kaa paryaay ban gaya
 The Soviet proponents argued that the Soviet Union became an industrialized country in a very short period by adopting measures such as the socialization of major means of production, the subordination of market to centralized planning, and state control over foreign trade and domestic finances
 jabaki uske aalochakon kaa kahana tha ki yah ek prachaarit chhavi thi kyonki viraat naukarshahi, raajnneetik daman, asamanta tathaa loktantr kii andekhi swayan hi samaajwaad ke adarsh ko khaarij karne ke liye kaaphi thi
 The Soviet Union's second role in the spread of socialism was that of an organizer
 samaajawaadee kranti ke prasar ke liye communist international jaise sanghathan kii sthapana karke usne khud ko samaajwaad kaa haraval siddh kiya
 This organization guided the communist parties of the world for a long time
 soviet sangh kii bhoomika kaa teesraa pahalu yah tha ki usne purvi europe main kai hamshakl shashan vyavasthaayen kaayam kii
 Ultimately the laboratory of Soviet Union socialism was also considered because after the Russian Revolution Stalin's leadership propagated the principle that the socialist revolution should be strengthened in a single country before spreading to other countries
 kai vidwaanon kii drushti main yah ek aisa sutrikaran tha jisane rashtriya samaajwaad kii kai kismon ke ubhaar ko vaidhata dilaayi
 During the process of de-colonization that began after World War II, this fusion of socialism and nationalism became a form of development of socialism in third world countries
 china, vietnam tathaa cuba jaise deshon main samaajwaad ke prasar kii yah ek kendriya pravriti thi
 Apart from Soviet-backed socialism, it has another form which has influenced the capitalist countries indirectly
 masalan, samaajwaad ke tark or uske aakarshan ko prati-santulit karne ke liye pashchim ke poonjeewaadi deshon ko apni arthvyavastha ke saanche ko badal kar use kalyankari rup dena padaa
 In this context, Scandinavian countries, western Europe and Australasia region countries, inspired by Keynes's philanthropic ideas, attempted to create an alternative to Soviet lines of socialism
 maang ke prabandhan, aarthik rashtrawaad, rojgaar kii guarantee, tathaa saamaajik sevaaon ke kshetra ko munafkhori kii pravritiyon se mukt rakhane kii niti par tike in kalyankari upayon ne ekbargi poonjeewaad or samaajwaad ke antar ko hi dhundla kar diya tha
 This welfare model of the state was once being described as a permanent cure for the anomalies of capitalism - unemployment, unemployment, scarcity, ignorance etc
 is model kii aarthik or raajnneetik kamyaabi kaa subut is baat ko mana ja saktaa he ki agar vampanthi daayaron main in upayon kii prashansa kii gayi to dakshinpanthi raajnneeti bhi unka khulaa virodh nahin kar saki
 This model of market-centric socialism continued to function quite effectively for three decades after the end of the Second World War
 lekin saatven dashak main mandi or mudrasphiti kii dohari maar tathaa kalyankari poonjeewaad ke garh main badhate saamaajik or audyogic asantosh ke kaaran is model ke auchity ko lekar sawaal khadey hone lage
 Scholars of the Marxist camp had also been consistently saying that instead of eliminating inequality and exploitation, welfare problems have strengthened capitalism itself
 is model kaa ek aapattijanak pahalu yah bhi prakat hua ki kaamgaar varg ko jivan kii buniyadi suvidhaayen pradaan karne vaali mashinari ke dwaara rajya us par niyantran karne kii sthiti main aa gaya
 The neo-liberal intellectuals had been opposing this model from the beginning, keeping the market intact and implementing some elements of socialism
 saatven dashak main yah varg jor-shor se kehane laga tha ki samaajwaad na keval arthvyavastha ko jad bana detaa he balki vyakti kii swatantraaa bhi chin letaa he
 In the nineties, when the socialist systems of Eastern Europe collapsed one after another with the Soviet Union, this criticism of socialism began to gain wide legitimacy and talk of the end of history with socialism
 vijay ke unmaad main udaaravaadi buddhijiviyon ne yah bhi kaha ki manushyata ke liye poonjeewaad hi ekmaatr vikalp he lihaaja ab uske vikalp kii baat bhuulakar keval yah sochaa janaa chahie ki poonjeewaad kii koi or shakl kya ho sakati he
 Karl Marx's fellow Angels named the earliest currents of modern socialism as conceptual socialism
 in vichaaron kaa aadhaar bhautik or vaigyanik nahin, naitik tha; inke vichaarak dhyey kii prapti ke sudhaarwadi sadhano main vishwaas karte the; or bhavi samaaj kii vistrut parantu avastavik kalpana karte the
 These include the socialist ideas of the Seams, Charles Furie, and Robert Owen

 rowart owain tathaa chartist andolan ke prabhaav se yahan swatantra majdoor andolan kii neenv pad chuki thi, fabian socity ne is andolan ko darshan diya
 The name of this gathering is derived from Fabius Kunketer Fabian

 German recapitalism was influenced by Britain's Fabiusism and the changed circumstances of Germany

 Marx's ideas had influence on these countries
 parantu 19veen shatabdi ke ant main germany main bhi audyogic unnati hui or rajya ne kuch vyaktigat tathaa raajnneetik adhikaar sweekaar kiye
 As a result, the standard of living of workers increased and the influence of their political party - Social Democratic Party, also increased
 uske anek sadsy sansad ke sadsy ban gaye
 In this situation, this force in principle became reformist in practice even after accepting the revolutionary path of Marx
 aduard bernstin ne is vaastaviktaa ke aadhaar par marxvad ke sanshodhan kaa praytn kiya
 Bernstein was a prominent philosopher of the Social Libertarian Party and a close disciple of Angels
 vah britain main kai varsh tak nirvasit rahaa or vahaan fabiaswad se prabhavit hua
 Marx's statement was that due to mutual competition and economic crises, the capitalist and middle class would shrink and the working class would become poor, broad, organized and revolutionary which would soon lead to the establishment of socialism
 sthiti iske vipareet thi, jisko bernstin ne sweekaar kiya or is aadhaar par usne krantikari kaarykram ke sthaan main taatkaalik samajasudhar or samaajwaad kii safalataa ke liye vargsangharsh ke sthaan main shrenee-sahyog tathaa sansadatmak or sanvaidhanik maarg par jor diya
 He also began to accept the influence of moral and uneconomical elements in place of Marx's historical materialism
 bernstin ke vichaaron ko punraritivaad ko naam diya gaya
 Although the German labor movement remained reformist in practice, it expressed confidence in Marx's ideas by rejecting Bernstein's amendments under the leadership of Karl Kautsky
 fabiuswadi or punraritivaadee vichaarak samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye rajya ko aavashyak samajhate hai
 Communist thinkers also want to use the power of Adam for the transition period

 Anarchist thinkers are also anti-capitalists and supporters of socialism but they consider state, politics and religion as advocates of exploitative system and want to end it from the beginning
 araajaktaavaad jivan or aacharan kaa ek siddhant he jo shashanviheen samaaj kii kalpana karata he

 By that time, the workers' faith in Fabius and Revivalism had begun to wane
 loktantr mazdooron kii samasyaayen sulajhane main asafal rahaa, aarthik sankat vikat rup dhaaran karne laga or yuddh kii sambhaavna badhane lagi
 At the same time the number of laborers increased, their organization strengthened and they went on a massive strike to fulfill their demands
 in paristhitiyon main sansadatmak or sanvaidhanik tareekon ke sthaan main majdoor varg ko sakriy virodh ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hui
 The above ideologies filled this gap
 sindikawaad anya samaajwaadiyon kii bhanti samaajawaadee vyavastha ke paksh main he parantu araajaktaavaadiyon kii tarah vah rajya kaa ant kar sthaneey samudaayon ke haath main saamaajik niyantran chahta he
 It wants to restrict this control to the productive class only
 araajaktaavaadiyon kii bhanti sindicavaadi bhi rashtriya tathaa antarrashtriya sanghon ke samarthak or rajya, raajnneetik dal, yuddh or sanyavad ke virdohi hai
 The syndicalist path to achieve the goal is revolution, but even for this revolution, it considers the political party unnecessary because it fears the weakening of the revolutionary will of the workers
 iskaa hadataalon main atoot vishwaas he
 According to Sorel, like the Christian mythological revival, it also casts a spell on the workers and encourages the feelings of communion and revolution in them
 ye vichaarak mashiinon kii todphod, bicat, poonjipati kii paidaavaar ko badnaam karnaa, kaam taalna aadi ke paksh main bhi hai
 In the end, they want to establish a syndicist society by ending the capitalist system through a general strike
 in vichaaron se anek laathini desh france, italy, spain, madhya or dakshin america prabhavit hue hai
 They also had an impact in the United States, but there was no emphasis on decentralization because large-scale industries were a reality in that country
 roosi vichaarak prince cropotkin ne isse prerana praapt kii or britain ne isko sanshodhit rup main sweekaar kiya
 Guild socialism is not merely a copy of syndicism, it is an adaptation to British conditions
 gild samaajwaad ke upar swadhinata kii parampara or fabiaswad kaa bhi prabhaav he
 Its name is derived from medieval commercial organizations in Europe
 us samay se sangh aarthik or saamaajik jivan par haaavee the or vibhinn sanghon ke pratinidhi nagaron kaa shashan chalaate the
 Guild socialists took inspiration from the above union system
 ve raajnneetik kshetra or udyog dhandhon main loktantratmak siddhant or swaittashasan sthapit karnaa chaahate the
 These thinkers are not satisfied with the nationalization of industries simply because they fear bureaucracy but they also do not want to end the state
 rajya ko adhik loktantratmak or vikendrit karne ke baad ve usko deshraksha or bhokta ke hitsaadhan ke liye rakhana chaahate hai
 According to him, there should be not only regional but also professional representation in the state parliament
 ye rajya or udyogon par mazdooron kaa niyantran chaahate hai at: sindikawaad ke nikat hai parantu rajyavirohi na hone ke kaaran inkaa jhukaav samoohwaad kii ore bhi he
 They do not accept the revolutionary path in fear of failure but only consider the legal path inadequate and also support the active movement of workers, strike etc
 pratham mahayuddh ke purv or uske bich main is vichaardhaara kaa prabhaav badha
 During the war, the workers demanded control over the defense industries and after that the trade unions took contracts to build the houses themselves, but after some time these experiments failed due to lack of government support
 gild samaajwaad ke pramukh samarthakon main arthur painti, habsan, orange or kol ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Britain's labor party and labor movement have been particularly influenced by this ideology
 mukhya lekh samyawad dekhiye
 The revolution which Marx had predicted in his "communist Manifesto" in 1848 was partially true and the flame of revolution continued to spread in Europe for many years after that and then; But the socialist system which he hoped could not be established, direct revolutions were suppressed and capitalism developed in the place of collapse
 france or prasha ke bich yuddh ke samay paraajay ke kaaran paris main pratham samaajawaadee shashan sthapit hua parantu kuch hi dinon main usko bhi dabaa diya gaya
 The Paris Commune reacted and the labor movements began to be suppressed and as a result the International Trade Union established by Marx was also dispersed
 majdoor andolanon ke saamne prashn tha ki ve samaajwaad kii sthapana ke liye krantikari maarg apnaayen athwa sudhaarwadi maarg grahan karen
 Under these circumstances certain reformist ideologies were born
 inamen isai samaajwaad, fabiaswad or punraritivaad mukhya hai
 The main campaigners of Christian socialism are John Melcome Ludlow of Britain, Bishop Claude Fosche of France and Victor Ime Huber of Germany
 poonjeewaadi shoshan dwaara mazdooron kii durdasha dekhakar in vichaarkon ne is vyavastha kii aalochana kii or mazdooron main sahakaari andolan kaa prachaar kiya

 sandhi shabd kaa arth he 'mail'
 The disorder that occurs between two adjacent characters is called Sandhi
 jaise - sam + tosh = santosh ; dev + indra = devendra ; bhanu + udai = bhaanuday
 There are three types of treaties - do swaron ke mail se hone vaale vikaar ko swar-sandhi kehete hai
 Such as - Vidya + Alaya = School
 swar-sandhi paanch prakaar kii hoti hai - sutra-ak: Savarna Long: That is, when the upper caste comes after a pratyahar, both of them become long
 hrasv yaa deergh a, i, u ke baad yadi hrasv yaa deergh a, i, u aa jaaen to donon milakar deergh aa, i or uu ho jate hai
 like - a / aa + a / aa = aa Treaty of e and e u or uu kii sandhi It consists of A, a before E, e then A; If there is O, o is o and if there is R, it becomes Ar
 ise gun-sandhi kehete hai
 like - a + i = e ; nar + indra = narendra a + u = O; Wisdom + sermon = sermon; a + ri = ar dev + rishi = devarshi Aa + r = Ar Maha + Rishi = Maharishi a, aa kaa e, i se mail hone par i tathaa a, aa kaa o, ou se mail hone par ou ho jaataa he
 This is called growth pact
 jaise - a + a = Ai; a + a = acac; a + o = ou van + aushadhi = vanaushadhi ; aa + o = ou maha + aushadhi = mahaushadhi ; If there is an exogenous vowel in front of E, E, e becomes 'Y'
 u, uu ke aage kisi vijaateey swar ke aane par u uu ko ‘v’ ho jaataa he
 When a foreign vowel comes in front of 'R', r becomes 'R'
 inhen yan-sandhi kehete hai
 e + a = or + A; River + Arpan = Removal u + e = v + e ; anu + eshan = anveshan Any vowel beyond A, Ai and Ou becomes Ay, Ay, Av and Av respectively
 ise ayaadi sandhi kehete hai
 a + a = Ay + A; Ne + un = nayan i + a = aay + a ; gai + ak = gayak o + a = av + a; Po + Un = Wind ou + a = aav + a ; pau + ak = paavak Au + e = Av + E; Nine + iq = sailor vyanjan kaa vyanjan se athwa kisi swar se mail hone par jo parivartan hota he use vyanjan sandhi kehete hai
 like-sharat + Chandra = Sharachandra
 ujjwal If the first letter of a square, ch, t, t, p matches the third or fourth letter of a class or is a word, l, l, v, or a vowel, then k is called g, t is d
 And p becomes ble
 jaise - If the first letter of a class matches the letter n or m then it becomes the fifth character of the same class
 jaise - If the word combines with c, d, d, d, b, b, y, r, or or any vowel, it becomes d
 jaise - Beyond T, it becomes l when it is or is not J, i get j or J, i get t or i get T, Dr or i get d and l is taken
 jaise - If t combines with Sch, then t becomes ch and ch becomes ch
 jaise - If t combines with h then t becomes d and h is D
 jaise - If the six letters come after the vowel, then the six letters before the six are increased
 jaise - If there is a consonant from k to m after M, then m changes to Anuswara
 jaise - After M, m becomes dual
 jaise - m is a reminder after a dish containing any of the words y, y, l, l, v, sh,,, st, h
 jaise - R, र, becomes n beyond N
 parantu chavarg, tavarg, tavarg, sha or sa kaa vyavdhaan ho jane par n kaa n nahin hota
 like - s se pehle a, aa se bhinn koi swar aa jaae to s ko sha ho jaataa he
 like - visarg ke baad swar yaa vyanjan aane par visarg main jo vikaar hota he use visarg-sandhi kehete hai
 Like- manah + favorable = manokool visarg ke pehle yadi ‘a’ or baad main bhi ‘a’ athwa virgon ke tisare, chauthe paanchaven varna, athwa ya, r, l, va ho to visarg kaa o ho jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle a, aa ko chhodkar koi swar ho or baad main koi swar ho, varg ke tisare, chauthe, paanchaven varna athwa y, r, l, va, ha main se koi ho to visarg kaa r yaa r ho jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle koi swar ho or baad main c, chha yaa sha ho to visarg kaa sha ho jaataa he
 like - visarg ke baad yadi t yaa sa ho to visarg s ban jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle i, u or baad main k, kha, t, tha, pa, pha main se koi varna ho to visarg kaa sha ho jaataa he
 like - visarg se pehle a, aa ho or baad main koi bhinn swar ho to visarg kaa lop ho jaataa he
 like - visarg ke baad k, kha athwa pa, pha hone par visarg main koi parivartan nahin hota
 like - lakhanu vimaanashetra lakhanu main sthit he

 Edward Gibbon was a historian and member of England
 unki 'history of da dicline and phal of roman impaire' naamak kriti 1776 se 1788 ke bich chah khandon main prakashit hui
 Edward Gibbon was born into an old educated house in Putne City
 pita parlment ke member the
 Gibbon made good use of the rich library of the grandfather
 ucch shiksha ke arth oxfard vishvavidhyalay ke magdalen kaliz main yah bhartee kiye gaye, kintu vahaan se inako chaudaa maheene baad hi hataa lenaa padaa
 Gibbon wrote in his biography, this fourteen months proved to be the most unusable period of my life
 uniwarsity kaa svachhand jivan kishor giban ke liye ahitkar hua
 His mind was distracted by his ancestral religion, Protestant religion
 kuch din to yah is duvidha main pade rahe ki mohammad ke anuyani bane athaav pope ke
 But in the end he converted to Protestantism under the influence of the Calvinist clergy
 inhen padri mahoday ke sangrakshan main giban ne francisi, greek or roman sahitya, darshan, nyaay, ganit aadi kaa atyant sadhana ke saath adhyayan or anushilan kiya
 Gibbon was introduced to France's famous litterateur Boltier during this period, which gave him great inspiration in the design
 isi bich ek francisi kuleen kanya ke prati aakarshith hokar giban ne usase vivaah karnaa chaha, kintu apane pita ke virodh ke kaaran unhone apana sankalp tyaag diya
 In connection with this incident, Gibbon used these poignant words in his autobiography that he obeyed the father's command like a son, and sobbed like a lover
 nidaan, shiksha samaapti karke 1758 main giban england laut aae
 In 1761, Gibbon published his first work 'on the Study of Literature' in French, which brought him honor in scholarly society
 tadnantar giban ne europe kii yatra kii
 It was during this journey that Gibeon was inspired to write his famous treatise 'decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' by looking at the ruins of Rome
 is granth ke puraa karne main giban ko 15 saal lage
 This large text contains fine and well-organized descriptions and explanations of the history of Europe and its adjacent territories and castes for fourteen centuries, including many highly marque eras of world history

 Gibeon's generous imagination, distinctive intelligence, abundant search, persistent diligence and delightful wordiness are universally introduced in this monumental book

 Prof
 Freeman is of the opinion that whatever else is read in history or not, Giban must be read
 isi prakaar frendrick harrison kaa mat he ki jaise aflatoon kii academy ke dwaar par yah ullekh tha ki jisane rekhganit ko siddh nahin kar liya vah yahan pravesh na kare, usee prakaar itihaas kii adarsh paathshaala ko apane singhdwar par yah sookhti khudva leni chahie ki giban ko siddh kiye bina yahan pravesh varjit he
 In summary, this book of Gibbon is one of the few, if not unique, books in the entire history of history
 antim dinon main giban ne apni jeevani kii rachana kii jo saahitiyik kala kii drushti se uparyukt aitihaasik granth se bhi anek alaachakon ko mahattar lagati he
 The language of the texts of Gibbon is very important
 vaakya or vaakyansh lambey or dirghagami hote hue bhi aadi se ant tak aise gunthe hue or sutarabaddh hai or unamem shabd or swar kaa aisa madhur yoga he ki pathak ko vaadya kaa swaad miltaa he
 Gibbon was also a member of the Parliament for about eight years, but his carelessness was only ordinary there

 The story told by the seventeenth pupil named Vidyavati is as follows - Maharaja Vikramaditya's subjects had no shortage
 sabhi log santusht tathaa prasann rahete the
 Whenever a court came with a problem, its problem was solved immediately
 praja ko kisi prakaar kaa ksht dene vaale adhikari ko dandit kiya jaataa tha
 Therefore, no complaints were heard from anywhere
 raja khud bhi vesh badalakar samay-samay par rajya kii sthiti ke bare main jaanane ko nikalate the
 On one such night, as he was visiting his kingdom in disguise, he heard an excerpt from a hut
 koi aurat apane pati ko raja se saafe-saafe kuch bataane ko kah rahi thi or uskaa pati use kah rahaa tha ki apane swaarth ke liye apane mahaan raja ke praan vah sankat main nahin daal saktaa he
 Vikram understood that he had something to do with his problem
 unase rahaa nahin gaaya
 He considered it his duty to solve every problem of his subjects
 unhone dwaar khatkhataya, to ek brahman dampatti ne darwaja kholaa
 When Vikram introduced himself and asked him about his problem, he trembled
 jab unhone nirbhay hokar unhen sab kuch spasht bataane ko kaha to brahman ne unhen sari baat bataa di
 The Brahmin couple were childless even after twelve years of marriage
 in baarah saalon main santan ke liye unhone kaafii ytn kiye
 Fasting, fasting, religious work, worshiping all kinds of efforts are of no use
 brahmani ne ek sapana dekha he
 In a dream, a goddess came and told him that in the east direction at a distance of thirty kos, there is a dense forest where some saints are praising Shiva
 shiv ko prasann karne ke liye havan kund main apane ang katkar daal rahe hai
 If, like him, King Vikramaditya cut off his limbs in that Havan Kund, Shiva would be pleased to ask him to ask for what he wanted
 ve shiv se brahman dampatti ke liye santan kii maang kar sakate hai or unhen santaan prapti ho jaaegi
 On hearing this Vikram assured him that he would definitely do this work
 raast main unhone betaalon ko samaran kar bulaayaa tathaa us havan sthal tak pahunchaa dene ko kaha
 At that place, saints and ascetics were actually performing havan and cutting their limbs and throwing them in the fire pit
 vikram bhi ek taraf baith gaye or unheen kii tarah apane ang katkar agni ko arpit karne lage
 When all of them including Vikram were burnt to ashes, a Shivgana reached there and he put all the ascetics alive by putting nectar, but accidentally left Vikram
 saare tapasvi zindaa hue to unhone raakh hue vikram ko dekha
 All the ascetics praised Shiva together and prayed to him to bring Vikram alive
 bhagwaan shiv ne tapasweon kii prarthana sun lee tathaa amrit daalkar vikram ko jivit kar diya
 As soon as Vikram was alive, he bowed down in front of Shiva and prayed to the child to give happiness to the Brahmin couple
 shiv unki paroapkaar tathaa tyaag kii bhaavana se kaafii prasann hue tathaa unki prarthana sweekaar kar lee
 a few days later, the Brahmin couple actually had a son

 It was about the same time that Kailashpati Shankar, who was suffering from Sati disconnection, wandered into Nagnavasta and came to the same Uttar Pradesh
 bhagwaan shankar kii swarna saddash tathaa tejpunjayukt kaaya ko dekh rishi muniyon kii patnio kii buddhi kamvihal ho gai or sara kaam dhandha bhuulakar shankar ko dekhne lagi
 Seeing the condition of his wives, the sage Muni got very upset and cursed Sadashiv Shankar in anger that you have corrupted our ashram, hence this penis will fall on the earth soon
 dekhte hi dekhte shankar kaa ling prithvi par or usee vakt ling dharaatal ko fadkar pataal me ja basaa
 Kailashpati Sadashiv Shankar regretted this and Lajjavash started living secretly from that moment
 bhagwaan shankar ko gupt vaas karne ke saath hi prithvi par anek updrav, utpaat tathaa kashth shuru ho gayi
 Seeing all this, the sage Muni and the people of Earth got frightened
 aisa lagane laga kii pralay aa gaya ho
 All sages, sages and deities came to Brahma and praised him, pleased him and asked the reason for the products happening on earth
 bramhaji samadhisth hue evam us utpaada kaa kaaran janaa or muniyo se kaha ki yah pralay kaa lakshan nahi he balki rishiyon ke shraap se sadashiv shankar kaa ling gir padane se utpann hui unki asthit tathaa shokmagn dasha ke kaaran hi yah sab ho rahaa he
 Then Brahma ji himself praised Lord Vishnu along with all the gods and goddesses and all the goddesses and Brahma, including Vishnu, arrived in Uttar Pradesh
 sabhi ne sadashiv shankar kii stuti kii
 Vandana started the way to please them and when Shankar was pleased, he reminded him of the miseries and products of the world
 kailashpati sadashiv shankar ne kaha sati ke viyog se mujhe atyant klesh pahuuchaa evam isi vajah se is ling kaa sthaan bhrasht karne kii meri ichha hui thi or main digmabar vesh main van upavan main phirata hua is aanart pradesh pahunchaa tathaa yahaan muniyon tathaa rishiyon ke shraap ke kaaran hi maine is ling kaa tyaag kiya he
 On hearing this Sadashiva Shankar, Brahma Vishnu and other gods asked him with humility that you should not grieve for Sati, where Parvati of Menaka will be born in the Himalayas and that Parvati is your Sati which you will be happy to receive
 isile aap is ling kaa purvavat dhaaran kar len
 Shankar told the gods before wearing the lingam that from today onwards, if Brahmins will worship the lord methodically, then only i will wear it
 at swayan bramhanau ne kaha ham bhi aapke ling kii puja kar sukhi prasann hongen
 By the way, your gender will be worshiped in the world and the people of earth will get happiness by living their life by worshiping your gender
 tab prasann hokar shankar ne pun ling dhaaran kar liya or bramhanau vishnu tathaa anya devataao ne haatak yani sone kaa ling banaakar pataal main usee sthaan par uski sthapana kar shaastra vidhi purvak uski puja archana kar shankar ko prasann kiya tathaa prithvi par shri mahadevaji kii ling puja kaa mahatyam badhaakar vartmaan sankat kaa nivaaran kiya

 The Linga established by Brahmaji became famous as Shri Hatakeshwar Mahadev and was considered as the total deity of the citizens

 bhautik vigyaan kii drushti se jab surya va prithvi ke bich main chandramaa aa jaataa he to chandramaa ke peeche surya kaa bimb kuch samay ke liye dhak jaataa he, usee ghatana ko surya grahan kaha jaataa he
 The earth revolves around the sun and the moon revolves around the earth
 kabhi-kabhi chaand, suraj or dharti ke bich aa jaataa he
 Then he stops some or all of the sunlight, which spreads the shadow over the earth
 is ghatana ko surya grahan kaha jaataa he
 This event always happens on the new moon day
 aksar chaand, suraj ke sirf kuch hisse ko hi dhaktaa he
 This situation is called khand-eclipse
 kabhi-kabhi hi aisa hota he ki chaand suraj ko puri tarah dhank letaa he
 This is called complete eclipse
 purna-grahan dharti ke bahut kam kshetra main hi dekha ja saktaa he
 At a maximum contact of 250 kilometers
 is kshetra ke baahar keval khand-grahan dikhaai detaa he
 At the time of complete eclipse, it takes two hours for the moon to pass through the sun
 chaand suraj ko puri tarah se, zyaada se zyaada, saat minute tak dhankta he
 The sky darkens for a few moments, or rather it turns night into day
 grahan prakruti kaa ek adbhut chamatkaar he
 If seen from astrology point of view, unprecedented unique, bizarre astrology makes knowledge of planets and satellites and their nature clear
 surya grahan tab hota he, jab surya aanshik athwa purna rup se chandramaa dwaara aavruth ho jaae
 For this type of eclipse, the moon must travel between the Earth and the Sun
 isse prithvi par rahane vaale logon ko surya kaa aavruth bhaag nahin dikhaai detaa he
 The lines joining the North Pole with the South Pole are called longitudes and the lines going around the equator are known as Anaksha
 surya grahan sadaiv amavasya ko hi hota he
 When the moon is at its lowest and the sun is full and bright
 chandra or raahu yaa ketu ke rekhaansh bahut nikat hone chahie
 The lunar latitude should be almost zero and this will happen when the lunar is on the Ravimarga or near the Ravimarga, the angular diameters of the Sun and the Moon are the same on the day of solar eclipse
 is kaaran chand surya ko keval kuch minute tak hi apni chaaya main le paata he
 The area which is covered at the time of solar eclipse is called full shadow region
 chandramaa dwaara surya ke bimb ke puure yaa kam bhaag ke dhake jane kii vajah se surya grahan teen prakaar ke hote hai jinhen purna surya grahan, aanshik surya grahan va valayakaar surya grahan kehete hai
 a full solar eclipse occurs when the moon, lying close to the Earth, moves between the Earth and the Sun and the Moon completely takes the Earth into its shadow zone
 iske falswaroop surya kaa prakaash prithvi tak pahunch nahin paata he or prithvi par andhkaar jaisi sthiti utpann ho jaati he tab prithvi par puraa surya dikhaai nahin detaa
 The eclipse created in this way is called a complete solar eclipse
 aanshik suryagrahan main jab chandramaa surya va prithvi ke bich main is prakaar aae ki surya kaa kuch hi bhaag prithvi se dikhaai nahin detaa he arthath chandama, surya ke keval kuch bhaag ko hi apni chaaya main le paata he
 Due to this, some part of the sun is unaffected by eclipse in the grass and some part is eclipse, so the eclipse in that particular part of the earth is called partial solar eclipse
 valayakaar surya grahan main jab chandramaa prithvi ke kaafii dur rahete hue prithvi or surya ke bich main aa jaataa he arthath chandra surya ko is prakaar se dhaktaa he, ki surya kaa keval madhya bhaag hi chaaya kshetra main aata he or prithvi se dekhne par chandramaa dwaara surya puri tarah dhakaa dikhaai nahin detaa balki surya ke baahar kaa kshetra prakashit hone ke kaaran kangan yaa valay ke rup main chamakta dikhaai detaa he
 The solar eclipse made in bracelet shape is called annular solar eclipse
 khagol shastriyon nen ganit se nishchit kiya he ki 18 varsh 18 din kii samyavadhi main 41 surya grahan or 29 chandragrahan hote hai
 There can be up to 5 solar eclipses and 2 lunar eclipses in a year
 kintu ek varsh main 2 suryagrahan to hone hi chahie
 Yes, if there are 2 eclipses in any year, both of them will be eclipsed
 yadhyapi varmbhar main 7 grahan tak sambhavya hai, tathaapi 4 se adhik grahan bahut kam hi dekhne ko milte hai
 Each eclipse occurs again after 18 years and 11 days have passed
 kintu vah apane pehle ke sthaan main hi ho yah nishchit nahin hai, kyonki sampaat bindu nirantar chal rahe hai
 Generally, lunar eclipses are seen more than solar eclipses, but the truth is that there are more solar eclipses than lunar eclipses
 3 chandragrahan par 4 suryagrahan kaa anupaat aata he
 The reason for more sighting of the lunar eclipses is that they are seen in more than half of the earth, while the solar eclipse often appears in a large part of the earth less than a hundred miles wide and two to three thousand miles long
 
 udhaaharan ke taur par yadi madhyapradesh main khagrass grahan ho to gujarat main khand suryagrahan hi dikhalaai degaa or uttar bharat main wo dikhaayi hi nahin degaa
 Whether the eclipse has any spiritual significance or not, but for scientists all over the world, this opportunity is not less than a celebration
 kyon ki grahan hi vah samay hota he jab brahmand main anekon vilakshan evam adbhut ghatnaayen ghatit hotin hai jisase ki vaigyanikon ko naye naye tathyon par kaary karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 In 1968, a scientist named Larkier discovered the presence of helium gas in the chromosphere by the discovery made on the occasion of solar eclipse
 ainstin kaa yah pratipaadan bhi surya grahan ke avasar par hi sahi siddh ho sakaa, jisamen unhone anya pindon ke gurutvkarshan se prakaash ke padane kii baat kahi thi
 The lunar eclipse can be seen in its entire area of light, but the solar eclipse can be seen only in a maximum area of 10 thousand kilometers and 250 kilometers wide
 sampoorn suryagrahan kii vaastavik avadhi adhik se adhik 11 minute hi ho sakati he usase adhik nahin
 The composition of all the material of the world is possible only through the sun signs
 yadi sahi prakaar se surya or uski rashmiyon ke prabhaavon ko samaj liya jaae to samast dharaa par ascharyajanak parinaam laae ja sakate hai
 Each Rashmi of the Sun represents a particular molecule, and as evident, each substance is formed from a particular atom
 ab yadi surya kii rashmiyon ko puunjibhoot kar ek hi vishesh bindu par kendrit kar liya jaae to padaarth parivartan kii kriya bhi sambhav ho sakati he
 Even before the Vedic period, the need to create a calendar based on astronomical structure was felt
 surya grahan chandra grahan tathaa unki punrariti kii purv soochna isa se chaar hajaar purv hi uplabdh thi
 According to the Rigveda, this knowledge was available with the family of Atrimuni

 This phenomenon of planetary constellations has been known to Indian mystics since very ancient times
 chir pracheen kaal main maharishiyon nen gananaa kar di thi
 On this, religious, Vedic, ideological, scientific discussion has been going on in religious and astrological texts
 maharishi atrimuni grahan ke gyaan ko dene vaale pratham acharya the
 Studies, contemplations and trials have been taking place on the eclipse from the Rig Veda period, that is, the Vedic period
 hamaare rishi-muniyon ne surya grahan lagane ke samay bhojan ke liye manaa kiya he, kyonki unki manyata thi ki grahan ke samay main keetanu bahulata se fail jate hai
 Microorganisms collect in food items, water etc
 and contaminate it
 isliye rishiyon ne paatro ke kush daalane ko kaha he, taaki sab keetanu kush main ekatrit ho jaaen or unhen grahan ke baad phenkaa ja sake
 They are made holy by putting fire in the characters so that germs die
 grahan ke baad snaan karne kaa vidhaan isliye banaaya gaya taaki snaan ke dauraan sharir ke andar ooshmaa kaa pravaah bade, bheetar-baahar ke keetanu nasht ho jaaen or dhul kar bah jaaen
 According to the Puranas, Rahu resides on the Moon and Ketu in the Sun
 ye donon hi chaaya kii santan hai
 The shadow of the moon and the sun move side by side
 chandra grahan ke samay kaph kii pradhanta badhati he or man kii shakti ksheen hoti he, jabaki surya grahan ke samay jathragni, netra tathaa pitt kii shakti kamazor padati he
 a pregnant woman should not see a solar-lunar eclipse, because its side effects can cause the child to become disabled and disabled, the possibility of miscarriage increases
 iske liye garbhvatee ke udar bhaag main gobar or tulsi kaa lep laga diya jaataa he, jisase ki rahu-ketu uskaa sparsh na karen
 During the eclipse, the pregnant woman is forbidden to cut anything with scissors or a knife and is prevented from stitching any clothes
 kyonki aisi manyata he ki aisa karne se shishu ke ang yaa to cat jate hai yaa phir sil jate hai
 Before taking the eclipse, bathing with water available in the river or house should worship God, sacrifice, and chant
 bhajan-kirthan karke grahan ke samay kaa sadupyog karen
 Do not do any work during the eclipse

 kuch log grahan ke dauraan bhi snaan karte hai
 After the eclipse is over, there is a law to bathe and give donations to the Brahmin
 kahin-kahin vastra, bartan dhone kaa bhi niyam he
 Old water, food grains are destroyed and new food is cooked and freshly filled and drunk
 grahan ke baad dom ko daan dene kaa adhik mahatmaya bataaya gaya he, kyonki dom ko rahu-ketu kaa swaroop mana gaya he
 In the solar eclipse, four hours before the eclipse and three hours before the lunar eclipse should not be eaten
 boode balak or rogi ek prahar purv tak kha sakate hai grahan puraa hone par surya yaa chandra, jiskaa grahan ho, grahan ke din pattey, tinke, lakdi or phool nahin todna chahie
 Hair and clothes should not be squeezed and dental hygiene should not be open at the time of eclipse, sleeping, excluding urine, stools, sex and eating - all these functions are forbidden

 The following political parties have a coalition in India
 dardi yaa dardik bhashaayen hind-arya bhashaaon kii ek upashakha he jisaki sabase jaani-maani bhashaa kashmiri he
 Dardi languages are spoken in northern Pakistan, north-eastern Afghanistan and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir
 sari dardi bhashaaon main kashmiri kaa hi rutaba sabase unchaa he kyonki iskaa apana prachlit sahitya he or ise bharat kii ek aadhikarik bhashaa hone kaa maan bhi praapt he
 The Khwar language of Chitral district of Pakistan, the Sheena language spoken in northern Kashmir and the Pashai language spoken in eastern Nuristan, Nangarhar and Kuner states of Afghanistan are other famous Dardi languages
 isamen koi do raay nahin hai ki lagbhag sabhi dardi bhashaaon par sanskrit, farsi, punjabi, hindi-urdu ityadi kaa prabhaav padaa he or inke kai shabd dardi bhashaaon main istemaal hote hai
 But many linguists believe that Dardi languages too have left their mark on non-dardi hindi-aryan languages
 yah maananaa he ke punjabi, uttarakhand kii kuch boliyaan or kuch or bhashaaon par dardi kaa prabhaav nazar aata he
 While this continues to be disputed, there is a belief that in ancient times Dardi was spoken over a very large area which was spread around the Indus River and then in Himachal and Uttarakhand
 dardi bhashaaon kii kuch khaas chijen hai jinase samooche hind-arya bhashaa parivaar main unki pahchaan banati he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjanon kaa uccharan alpapraan vyanjanon jaisaa hota he 
 In most hid-aryan languages, aspiration consonants are spoken with airflow, such as the aspirated consonant 'b' is spoken by airflow while its corresponding hypnotic consonant 'a' has very little airflow
 Is spoken with
 aisa dardik bhashaaon main nahin he
 In these languages, the diacritic and mahaprana consonants are distinguished by changing the tone rather than the airflow
 misaal ke taur par jahaan sanskrit main 'bhoomi' shabd he vahaan khovaar bhashaa main 'buum' he jisame awaz mote swar se patale swar kii ore jaati he 
 In the same way, where there is 'smoke' from the great word 'd' in Hindi, there is 'dum' from the short word 'd' in Pashai
 sanskrit ke 'dugdh' ore hindi ke 'doodh' ke sthaan par kashmiri main 'dod' hota he
 In the same way in the western hill and Punjabi, there is a change of tone in place of mahaprana, as in Punjabi, instead of 'home' in Hindi, the vowel is the word 'kara'
 dardi bhashaaon main aksar shabdaansh sthanantaran ho jaataa he, jisame ek hi shabd ke 'r' ke varna ke ird-gird koi swar apane sthaan main pher-badal kar letaa he
 It has been in ancient times in the Dardi languages and can also be seen in the rocks of the era of Emperor Ashoka in Gandhara region, which were erected from 269 BC to 231 BC
 samraat ashok kii ek oopaadhi 'priyadarshi' thi - lekin in shilaon par aksar 'priyadrashi' dekhne ko miltaa he kyonki shabdaansh sthanantaran ke kaaran 'darsh' kaa 'drash' ban gaya
 Similarly, on these rocks, 'dharma' is found in place of 'dharma'
 aadhunik kaal main sanskrit ke 'deergh' shabd kii jhalak kalash bhashaaon ke 'drig' shabd main milti he
 In Palula language, 'weak' in Sanskrit becomes 'drubal' and in Sanskrit 'bhurj' it becomes 'barhuj'
 sanskrit kaa 'daridr' kashmiri kaa 'droled' ban jaataa he or 'karm' kashmiri main 'kram' ban jaataa he
 This trend of Dardi languages can also be seen to some extent in Punjabi and Western Pahari languages
 jahaan farsi main ped ko 'darakht' kehete hai vahaan punjabi main yah 'drakhat' ho jaataa he
 In most indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence
 lekin dardik bhashaaon main kriya shabd vaakya ke bich main aate hai
 In this case Dardi languages are like English
 upar likhe hue vaakyon main kriya ko gadhe aksharon main likhaa gaya he
 As is clear, in almost all indo-iranian languages, the verb comes at the end of the sentence, but Dardic breaks this rule and puts the verb after the noun, as in English
 aisi bhashaaon ko jo kriya sangya ke baad daalati hon "kriya dwitiya bhashaayen" kaha jaataa he
 Sankranti means 'the Sun's transition from one zodiac to the next zodiac'
 atah puure varsh main kul 12 sakrantiyaan hoti hai
 Mass starts on the day of Sankranti in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Orissa, Punjab and Gujarat

 It is likely that the Kollam or Malayalam Samvat beginning in 824–25 AD, which some scholars associate with the establishment of Kollam, was actually related to the end of the reign of Cherman Perumal
