 Poetry, poetry or poetry, is the genre of literature in which a story or emotion is artistically expressed by a language
 bharat main kavita kaa itihaas or kavita kaa darshan bahut purana he
 Its beginning can be understood from Bharatmuni
 kavita kaa shabdic arth he kaavyatmak rachana yaa kavi kii kriti, jo chhandon kii shrunkhalaaon main vidhivat baandhi jaati he
 Poetry is the syntax that makes the mind complete with any juices or impulses
 arthath vahjisamen chune hue shabdon ke dwaara kalpana or manovegon kaa prabhaav daalaa jaataa he
 In Rasgangadhar the exponent of the meaning of 'delightful' is called 'poetry'
 'arth kii romaniyata' ke antargat shabd kii romaniyata bhi samajhakar log is lakshan ko sweekaar karte hai
 But 'elegance' of 'earth' can be of many types
 isse yah lakshan bahut spasht nahin he
 Literature is the most appropriate sign of the poet Vishwanath
 uske anusaar 'rasaatmak vaakya hi kavy he'
 Ras is the soul of poetry of pleasant communication of the souls
 kavyprakash main kavy teen prakaar ke kahe gaye hai, dhwani, gunibhoot vyangy or chitra
 Sound is one in which the hidden meaning is dominant, rather than the meaning derived from the words
 gunibhoot byangy vah he jisamen gaun ho
 a picture or an ornament is one in which a miracle is done without exorcism
 in teenon ko kramshah uttam, madhyam or adham bhi kehete hai
 The poetic lighter's emphasis seems to be more on the hidden sense, not on the stimulus of the juice
 kavy ke do or bhed kiye gaye hai, mahakavy or khand kavy
 The epic canto and its hero must be a deity, king, or Dhirodatta, a rich Kshatriya
 usamen shringaar, vir yaa shant rason main se koi ras pradhan hona chahie

 In the epic, the place of Sandhya, Surya, Chandra, Ratri, Prabhat, Mrigaya, Mountains, Forest, Ritu, Sagar, Sanyog, Vipralambha, Muni, Pur, Yajna, Ranprayana, Vivah etc
 should be imminent
 kavy do prakaar kaa mana gaya he, drishy or shravy
 Visual poetry is that which is shown by acting, such as drama, skit, etc
 which is readable and listenable, it is audible
 shravy kavy do prakaar kaa hota he, gadhy or padya
 The epic and Khandakavya of the verse poetry have been called two distinctions
 gadhy kavy ke bhi do bhed kiye gaye hai- katha or aakhyayika
 Champu, Virud and Karambhaka are considered three types of poetry and poetry
 saamanyat: sanskrit ke kavy-sahitya ke do bhed kiye jate hai- drishy or shravy
 In addition to visual poetic words, the costumes, gestures, motifs, actions and performances of the characters bring excitement to the audience's heart
 drishykavy ko 'roopak' bhi kehete hai kyonki uskaa rasaswadan netron se hota he
 Audible poetry communicates juice to the heart of readers and listeners through words

 The word 'padya', which is removed from the padma in the motion, indicates the primacy of motion
 at: padyakavy main taal, lay or chand kii vyavastha hoti he
 Again there are two strains of the verse - the epic and the Khandakavya
 khandakavy ko ‘muktkavy’ bhi kehete hai
 In the Khandakavya, instead of a complete chronicle of life like the epic, one part is described
 kavitv ke saath-saath sangitatkata kii pradhanta hone se hi inako hindi main ‘geetikavy’ bhi kehete hai
 The meaning of 'geeti' is to express the emotional spirit of the heart in a phased manner
 geeti kii aatma bhavatirek he
 The poet of his emotional sensation and imagination makes the narrative emotional
 geetikavy main kavyashastreey roodhiyon or paramparaon se mukt hokar vaiyaktik anubhav ko saralata se abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 By nature, the shape-type of lyrical poetry is smaller than the epic
 in sab tattvon ke sahyog se sanskrit muktakkavy ko ek utkrisht kavyarup mana jaataa he
 Muktakavya has become more popular than the epics
 sanskrit main geetikavy muktak or prabandh donon roopon main praapt hota he
 The best example of managerial lyricism is Meghdoot
 adhikansh prabandh geetikavy isi ke anukaran par likhe gayi hai
 Muktak is that in which each verse is independent in itself
 iske sundar udhaaharan amaruukshatak or bhatruharishtakatray hai
 Musical verses are characteristic of melodious verse lyrics
 shringaar, niti, vairaygy or prakruti iske pramukh pratipaadya vishay he
 a natural depiction of the beauty and nature of women is found in these poems
 upadesh, niti or lokvyavahaar ke sutara inamen bade hi romantic dhang se praapt ho jate hai
 This is the reason that the Suktikas and Subhashitas are found in abundance in Muktakayas
 muktakkavy kii parampara sfoot sandesh rachanaaon ke rup main vaidic yug se hi praapt hoti he
 In the Rigveda there is a reference to sending a dog named Sarma as messenger
 vaidic muktakkavy ke udaahranon main vasishtha or vamdev ke sookt, ullekhneey hai
 In the Ramayana, Mahabharata and their later texts, this type of sphincter is available in large quantities
 kadachit mahakavi valmiki ke shakodgaaron main yah bhaavana gopit rup main rahi he
 Hanuman, the messenger of Sri Rama sent to husband husbandman Pravasini Sita, Sri Krishna sent by Dharmaraja Yudhishthira towards Duryodhana and messenger Hans sent by King Nal near Sundari Dayamanti are the references counted under this tradition
 is sandarbh main bhagwat puraana kaa venugit vishesh rup se uddharaneey he jisaki rasvibhor karne vaali bhaavana chhavi sanskrit muktakkavyon par ankit he
 Rajasekhar has told in the episode of Kavicharya that the poet should take education of academics and sub-disciplines
 vyakaran, kosh, chand, or alankaar - ye chaar vidyaayein hai
 64 arts are subtexts
 kavitv ke 8 strot hai- swasthya, pratibha, abhyaas, bhakthi, vidwatkatha, bahushrutata, smritidrishta or raag
 Mammatt has stated six purposes of poetry - kavita yaa kavy kya he is vishay main bhartiya sahitya main aalochakon kii badi samrudh parampara he— acharya vishwanath, panditraj jagannatha, pandit ambikadutt vyas, acharya shripati, bhamah aadi sanskrit ke vidwaanon se lekar aadhunik acharya ramchandra shukla tathaa jaishankar prasad jaise prabud kaviyon or aadhunik yug kii mira mahadevi verma ne kavita kaa swaroop spasht karte hue apane apane mat vyakt kiye hai
 Scholars believe that the human heart wanders in the infinite form, trades of the eternal world, but when the human ego abandons the spirit and remains a pure feeling, then it becomes a free heart
 hriday kii is mukti kii sadhana ke liye manushya kii vaani jo shabd vidhaan karti ai he use kavita kehete hai
 Poetry elevates human beings from the narrow circle of selfish relationships and helps in making a raga connection with the rest of creation
 kavy kii anek paribhaashaayen di gai hai
 These definitions also hold true for modern Hindi poetry
 kavy siddh chitt ko alokik anandanubhuti karaata he to hriday ke taar zankrut ho uthte hai
 Poetry also contains the feeling of Satyam Shiva Sundaram
 jis kavy main yah sab kuch paaya jaataa he vah uttam kavy mana jaataa he
 There are two distinctions of poetry: swaroop ke aadhaar par kavy ke do bhed hai - shravyakavy evam drushyakavy
 The poetry which is praised by listening to others or reading by itself is called audible poetry
 jaise ramayana or mahabharat
 Audio poetry also has two distinctions - Prabandha poetry and Muktak poetry
 isamen koi pramukh katha kavy ke aadi se ant tak krambaddh rup main chalati he
 The sequence of the story breaks in the middle and secondary stories become helpful in between
 jaise ramcharita maanas
 There are two distinctions of management poetry - epic and Khandakavya
 1- mahakavy isamen kisi aitihaasik yaa puranic mahapurush kii sampurna jivan katha kaa adyopant varnan hota he
 These things must be in the epic - 2- khandakavy isamen kisi kii sampurna jeevanakatha kaa varnan na hokar keval jivan ke kisi ek hi bhaag kaa varnan hota he
 It is necessary to have these things in the section Poetry- isamen keval ek hi pad yaa chand swatantra rup se kisi bhav yaa ras athwa katha ko prakat karne main samarth hota he
 The songs, poets, doha etc
 are free
 jis kavy kii anandanubhuti abhinay ko dekhakar evam paatro se cathopakathan ko sun kar hoti he use drishy kavy kehete hai
 Like in a drama or a movie
 1- padya kavy - isamen kisi katha kaa varnan kavy main kiya jaataa he, jaise gitanjali 2- Prose Poetry - In this, a story is described in prose, such as Jaishankar's commission
 
 
 gadhy main kavy rachana karne ke liye kavi ko chand shaastra ke niyamon se svachhndatha praapt hoti he
 3- Champu Poetry - It consists of both prose and poetry
 maithilisharan gupt kii 'yashodhara' champu kavy he
 The history of modern Hindi poetry is about 800 years old and its beginning is understood from the thirteenth century
 har bhashaa kii tarah hindi kavita bhi pehle itivrittatmak thi
 That is, a story was tied with a rhythm and decorated with ornaments
 bhartiya sahitya ke sabhi pracheen granth kavita main hi likhe gaye hai
 The specific reason for this was that poetry was easy to memorize due to the rhythm and verses
 jis samay chhapekhane kaa avishkaar nahin hua tha or dastavezon kii anek pratiyaan bananaa aasaan nahin tha us samay mahatvapurn baton ko yaad rakh lene kaa yah sarvottam saadhan tha
 That is why at that time, along with literature, politics, science and Ayurveda were also written in the verse itself
 bharat kii pracheenatam kavitaayen sanskrit bhashaa main rugveda main hai jinamein prakruti kii prashasti main likhe gaye chhandon kaa sundar sankalan hai
 Many other subjects of life have also found place in these poems

 The actual meaning of the Latin word error is "to wander" or "to move around"
 Unlike an illusion, an error or a mistake can sometimes occur despite knowledge, however, some errors can also occur when a person knows how to do a work correctly
 udhaaharan ke liye ek chocolate kharidne ke baad vending mashin se bache hue paise lenaa bhul janaa, photocopy karwaane ke baad apane mul dastavej lenaa bhul janaa or khaanaa banane ke baad gas band karnaa bhul janaa
 is prakaar kii trutiyaan aksar tab hoti hai jab ek vyakti kisi duusari baat kii vajah se vichlit he
 One reference that makes the distinction between "error" and "mistake" is: maanav vyavhaar main vyavhaar ke liye maandand yaa ummiido yaa iske parinaamon ko ek abhinayta ke iraade se yaa kisi anya vyakti kii ummiido se yaa kisi saamaajik samooh se yaa saamaajik mandandon se vyutpann kiya ja saktaa he
 See deviations
 Specific examples of such errors can be labeled as omissions or wrong steps

 In the end, it can be said that a mistake is a mistake, a grammatical mistake or a verbal mistake or a weakness of emotion or posture that is manifested by body language
 haalanki, vastav main kisi tathy yaa saamaajik sachai ko shabdon athwa shaareerik bhashaa ke madhyam se prakat karnaa, aamtaur par sharmindagi kaa kaaran ban saktaa he, yaa aisa tab ho saktaa he jab do logon ke bich koi baat ho rahi he or uskaa nakaaratmak arth nikaal liya jaye

 Engineers try to design devices, machines, and systems in such a way that as far as possible the effect of the error can be minimized or completely avoided, whether it is non-intentional or not
 In a system Such errors may be hidden errors in the design, it may happen that they are ignored for many years, until such a perfect set of circumstances arise, which Rann them to become active

 Some historians believe that the seeds of civil war were contained in the American freedom struggle itself, while some consider civil war as capitalist movement and some historians have attributed slavery to civil war

 sangh ke 34 rajyon main se 23 rajya uttar main sammilit the or desh kii kul jansankhya kaa 2 / 3 bhaag uttar main rahata tha, jisamen daason kii sankhya bahut kam thi
 Industry was predominant in the northern states
 udyogon main sooti, oonee vastra, chamade ke saamaan aadi vasteen bade paimaane par utpaadit hoti thi
 In these factories, labor was produced by machines, so slaves and slaves did not have much importance here
 duusari taraf america ke dakshini rajyon kaa aarthik jivan krishi par aadhaarit tha or krishi main yantron kaa bahut adhika prayog nahin hota tha
 Hence the peasants of these states depended on the labor of slaves for farming
 dakshin main kapaas, ganna evam tambaaku kii kheti bahut bade paimaane par hoti thi jisamen das majdoor ke rup main kaary karte the
 Therefore, the society of the south was completely dependent on slaves

 State industries in North America were predominant, so budding entrepreneurs there sought protection to avoid foreign competition
 unke hiton ko dhyaan main rakh america sangh dwaara udyogon ko sangrakshan diya gaya
 But this step was objected to by the southern states
 kyonki sangrakshan kii niti ke kaaran ab unhen vinirmit vasteen apekshaakrit mahange mulya par milti thi
 Therefore, they felt that the Union was being used for the interests of North America and a view of neglect towards the southern states
 america ke uttari rajyon main daason kii aarthik jivan main koi nirnaayak jivan main koi nirnaayak bhoomika nahin thi
 Therefore, the importance of slaves was secondary to them
 On the other hand, slavery in the southern states of America had dissolved in life
 dakshini rajyon ke maamlen main das pratha kaa mudda sadaiv samvedansheel bana rahaa
 Whenever other states arose to implement the ban on slavery in these southern states, these states considered it an attack on their sovereignty
 vastutah uttari rajyon main daastaa ko maanavtaa par kalank ke rup main dekha gaya or ise samaapt karne ke kii maang jor shor uthaai gai
 This anti-slave sentiment was raised in the medium of newspapers
 duusari taraf dakshini rajyon ke liye daason ko mudda laabhpradata se judaa hua tha
 He argued that there was no fear of labor organizations, strikes etc
 in the slavery system and that they provide more facilities to slaves than workers of northern states
 is manovruti evam tarkon ke aadhaar par dakshini rajyon ne das pratha ko aavashyak bataaya
 Slave trade was abolished in North America and slavery ceased in the north to the southern border of Pennsylvania
 is seemaa rekha ko “mesum-dikson” seemaa kaha jaataa tha
 Now America was expanding into the western regions and new territories were being included in the United States
 aise main yah prashn uth khadaa hua ki in rajyon ko das rajya ke rup main yaa swatantra rajya ke rup main shaamil kiya jaae
 This issue was also important because in the constitution it was accepted that slaves were also counted in the federal administration, but the population of slaves was represented at an average of 3 / 5 ie if the population of slaves would be 500 then consider it 300 Representation began to be given
 is tarah das rajyon kii sankhya main vruddhi ho jane se vyavasthapika main das rajyon kaa varchasv bad jane kaa khatra tha
 Therefore, in the context of the merger of the new states, North America wanted to include it as a free state, while the southern states as a slave state
 yah vivaad mizori rajya ke vilay ko lekar or bhi gaharaa gaya
 So in 1820, the Missouri-settlement was concluded with the arbitration of Henry Clay

 This was followed by a proposal to merge Texas into the Union
 ant main texas das rajya ke rup main sangh main 1845 main shaamil ho gaya
 Then the issue of California was disputed and California was finally annexed as an independent state in 1850
 dakshini rajyon main is par ugr virodh jataayaa
 Now to satisfy them, a "fugitive slave" law was brought under which the runaway slave could be caught again

 In this way, the question of the merger of states widened the gap between the northern and southern states

 He felt that this victory was not compatible with the economic interests of the South

 By February 1861, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Lulciana, and Texas also disbanded the Union and appointed Jefferson Davis as their President, and the Civil War began, with the bombing of Sumter's Fort from South Carolina as the Union
 Waged war against dakshini rajyon dwaara sangh se alag ho jane ke kaaran ek mahatvapurn sanvaidhanik prashn khadaa ho gaya ki kya dakshini raj ko sangh se alag hone kaa adhikaar he? linkan ne raashtrapati pad par nirvachan ke pashchaat spasht rup se ghoshnaa kii ki sanyukt rajya america ke rup main jo sangh sthapit kiya gaya tha vah akhandaneey or shaashwat he, uski akhandaneeyata ko kisi prakaar nasht nahin hone diya jayega
 The framers of the US Constitution have not given any state the right to secede from the Union
 linkan ne ghoshit kiya ki "agar ham sabhi daason ko mukt kar sangh ko bachaa sake to ham aisa karenge agar ham daason ko mukt kiye bina sangh ko bachaa sake to ham aisa karenge or agar kuch daason ko mukt kar tathaa kuch anya ko mukt nahin karke sangh ko bachaa sake to ham vah bhi karenge
 "in this way Lincoln attempted to preserve the Union
 yuddh ke dauraan usne kootnithik kushalta ke jariye dakshini rajyon kaa videshon se sambandh banane nahin diya
 He organized the forces and broke the challenge of armed struggle of the south
 prarambh se hi usne senaaon kaa mukhya lakshya dakshini pradesh par adhikaar karnaa nahin varan parisangh kii senaaon kaa vistaar karnaa bataaya

 Lincoln made America a truly united national
 daastaa kaa unmoolan kar samaaj ko navajyoti di tathaa america raajnneetik tantra ko majbood banaaya
 But after the civil war, it could not advance America because it strengthened the political system
 parantu grihayuddh ke pashchaat america ko vah aage nahin badha sakaa kyaaki 15 apairal 1865 ko jon viscus booth dwaara uski hatya kar di gai
 The American Civil War served as a turning point in the history of the United States

 Resolved the dispute over the rights of the long-standing provincial and federal states
 dakshini rajyon ke aatmasamarpan ke pashchaat unhen sangh main punah shaamil kiya gaya
 This meant that the union of states would remain undone and that the right to separatism would never arise again in the future
 vastutah grihayuddh ke parinaam ne is sanvaidhanik prashn ko hal kar diya ki rajyon ko sangh se alag hone kaa adhikaar nahin he

 An important achievement of civil war in the social sphere was the abolition of slavery from America

 The Civil War was seen as a socio-economic catalyst power making America a major industrial nation

 Industrial capitalism quadrupled after the Civil War
 jin puunjipatiyon ne yuddh main dhan lagaakar or sena ke liye maal kii aapurti kaa theka lekar apaar laabh kamaaya unhone is dhan kaa sadupyog raashtra kii prakritik smapda ke dohan main kiya

 Women now started working in factories and offices
 stri shiksha ko badhaava mila jisase unka jivan str sudhara
 Therefore, discussions on women's rights increased
 america grihayuddh ko pratham aadhunik yuddh mana jaataa hai
 This was the first war in history in which armored warships fought
 pehali baar vyapak rup se topakhane tathaa gola barood kaa prayog kiya gaya
 Newspapers detailed war activities and influenced public opinion

 2
 intelligence - is taatpary he ki sochane, samajhane evam seekhney kii yogyata he

 AI includes many subjects, which include philosophy, sociology and knowledge of mathematics and language

 1- Thinking like a human 2- Behaving like a human 3- Reasoning and thinking means sensitive, intelligent, understanding the facts and also giving feedback on logic and ideas

 Aircraft on auto pilot mode are operated by the machine

 But artificial intelligence is also limited in one form, because its power depends on its programming

 Artificial intelligence has greatly facilitated human work
