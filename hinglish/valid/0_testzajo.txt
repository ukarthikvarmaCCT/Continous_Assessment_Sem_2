 During the conquest of Mecca in 630, Muhammad asked Ali to guarantee that the victory would be bloody
 unhone ali ko purv islamic yug ke bahuwaad se apni ashuddhta ke baad banu aus, banu khajaraj, taiy or kaaba ke logon dwaara puja kii jane vaali sabhi murtiyon ko todane kaa aadesh diya

 As Muhammad was returning from his last pilgrimage in 632, he made statements about Ali which have been interpreted very differently by Sunnis and Shias
 unhone gadir khum main kaaravaan ruk gai, sampradayik prarthana ke liye lautne vaale tirthayatriyon ko ikattha kiya or unhen sambodhit karnaa shuru kar diya
 According to the Encyclopedia of Islam: shiya in mukhyalayon ko mohammad ke uttaradhikari or pehle imam ke rup main ali ke padnaam ke rup main maanate hai; iske vipareet, sunni unhen keval mohammad or ali ke bich ghanishtha aadhyatmik sambandhon kii abhivyakti ke rup main lete hai, or unki ichha ke anusaar ali, unke chachere bhai or damaad ke rup main, unki mrityu par unki paariwarik jimmedaariyon kaa uttaradhikari he, lekin jaruri nahin ki unka pad raajnneetik adhikaar kai sufi is prakaran ko ali ke liye mohammad kii aadhyatmik shakti or adhikaar ke hastantaran ke rup main bhi samajhate hai, jinhen ve vaili sam utkrushtataa ke rup main maanate hai
 Both Shia and Sunni sources indicate that, after the sermon, Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman pledged allegiance to Ali
 mohammad ke uttaradhikaar yah bhi dekhen: quran kii utpatti or vikaas, mohammad, sakfah, rashidun or pad ke haddees ke uttaradhikarmuhammad kii mrityu ke baad 632 main ali ke jivan kaa ek or hissaa shuru hua or 656 main teesraa khalipha 'uthman ebn' afaan kii hatya tak chali gai
 During those 24 years, Ali neither participated in any war or victory, nor did he hold any executive position

 He used his time to serve his family and work as a farmer

 After uniting the Arab tribes into a Muslim religious polity in the last years of his life, Muhammad's death in 632 led to disagreements over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community
 jabaki ali or baaki mohammad ke kareebi parivaar apane sharir ko dafnane ke liye dho rahe the, jabaki sakifa main muslimon ke ek chote samooh ne bhaag liya, ek mohammad ke kareebi saathi abu bakar ko samudaay ke netritv ke liye namit kiya gaya tha
 Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph
 abu bakar kii pasand mohammad ke kuch saathi ne vivaadit kii thi, jinhone kaha tha ki ali ko mohammad ne apane uttaradhikari ko namit kiya tha
 Later when Fatimah and Ali sought assistance from the Sahyagis in the matter of the authority of the Caliph, they replied, 'O daughter of the Messenger of God! We have given our allegiance to Abu Bakr
 agar ali isse pehle hamaare paas aae the, to ham nishchit rup se use tyaag nahin paaenge
 Ali said, 'was it appropriate that we should quarrel with the Caliph before the Prophet was buried?' khilaafat ke chunaav ke baad, abu bakar or umr kuch anya saathi ke saath fatima ke ghar gaye or ali or unke samarthakon ko majaboor karne ke liye majaboor kiya jo abu bakar ko apana nishtha dene ke liye ikatthe hue the
 Then, it is alleged that Umar threatened to fire until they came out and swore allegiance to Abu Bakr
 apane pati ke samarthan main fatima ne ek pralobhan shuru kar diya or "apane baalo ko ujagar karne" kii dhamkee di, jis par abu bakar ne pashchaatap kiya or waapas le liya
 Ali has repeatedly said that he had forty men with him, he must have protested
 ali ne sakriy rup se apana adhikaar nahin lagaaya kyonki vah navjaat muslim samudaay ko sangharsh main phenkna nahin chahta tha
 Other sources say that Ali accepted Omar's selection as Khalifa and even gave his daughters Um Kulathum in marriage
 is vivaadaaspad mudde ne musalamaanon ko baad main do samoohon, sunni or shiya main vibhajit kar diya
 Sunnis insisted that Muhammad never appointed a successor, yet Abu Bakr was elected the first caliph by the Muslim community
 sunni mohammad ke sahi uttaradhikari ke rup main pehle chaar khalifon ko pahachaanate hai
 The Shias believe that Muhammad explicitly named Ali as his successor in the Ghadir Khumm and that the Muslim leadership belonged to him as determined by divine command
 wilferd madelang ke mutabik, ali swayan mohammad, unke ghanishtha sambandh or islam ke bare main unke gyaan or unke gunon kii seva main unki yogyata ke saath apane kareebi sambandh ke aadhaar par khalipha ke liye apni vaidhata se aashwast the
 He told Abu Bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance as a caliph was based on his conception of his earlier title
 ali ne aakhirkaar abu bakar or phir umr or uthman ke prati nishtha kaa vachan diya, lekin islam kii ekta ke liye aisa kiya tha, jab ek baar jab yah spasht ho gaya ki musalmaan usase dur ho gaye the
 Ali also believed that he could fulfill his role of Imamate without this fight
 abu bakar ke khaliphot kii shuruyaat main, mohammad kii beti, vishesh rup se fadak, fatimah or ali ke bich ek taraf or duusari taraf abu bakar ke bich ek vivaad tha
 Fatima asked Abu Bakr to change his property, the land of Fadak and Khaybar
 lekin abu bakar ne inkaar kar diya or unase kaha ki bhavishyavaktaaon ke paas koi viraasat nahin he or fadak muslim samudaay se sambandhit tha
 Abu Bakr said to him, "the Apostle of Allah said, We have no successors, everything we leave is Sadaka
 " umm ayman ke saath milakar, ali ne is tathy kii gavaahi di ki mohammad ne ise fatima jehar ko diya, jab abu bakar ne unase apane daawey ke liye gavaahon ko bulaava dene kaa anurodh kiya
 Fatima became angry and stopped talking to Abu Bakr, and he kept following the attitude until she died
 'aisha ne yah bhi kaha ki "jab allaah ke preshit kii mrityu ho gai, to unki patniyon ne uthman ko abu bakar ko bhejne ke liye kaha ki vah viraasat ke apane hisse ke liye kahen
 "then 'aisha said to them," Did not the Apostle of Allah say,' Our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave must be spent in charity? " kuch sutron ke mutabik, ali ne varsh 633 main apni patni fatima kii mrityu ke kuch samay baad abu bakar ko nishtha kii shapath nahin di thi
 'ali attended Abu Bakr's funeral
 unhone duusare khalipha umr ebn khattab ke prati nishtha kaa vachan diya or unhen ek vishwasaneey salaahkaar ke rup main madad kii
 Omar relied exclusively on Ali as the Chief Justice of Medina
 unhone umr ko islamic calendar kii shuruyaat ke rup main hijra set karne kii salaah di
 Omar used Ali's suggestions in political issues as well as religious ones
 'ali umr dwaara niyukt teesri khalipha chunane ke liye chunavi parishad main se ek tha
 Although 'ali was one of the two leading candidates, the council's system was against him
 saad ebn abi vakkaas or abdur rahamaan bin Awf, jo chachere bhai the, swaabhaavik rup se uthman kaa samarthan karne ke icchhuk the, jo abdur rahamaan ke damaad the
 In addition, Umar voted casting Abdur Rahman
 abdur rahamaan ne is shart par ali ko khalipha kii peshkash kii ki use quran ke anusaar shashan karnaa chahie, mohammad dwaara nirdhaarit udhaaharan, or pehle do khalipha dwaara sthapit udhaaharan
 Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it
 ilon abi al-hadeed kii tippaniyon ke anusaar ilokence ali ke shikhar par unki pratishtha par jor diya gaya, lekin adhikansh matadaataaon ne uthman or ali ko samarthan dene ke liye anicchhuk rup se aagrah kiya
 'uthman ibn' Afan expressed leniency towards his relative Banu abd-shams, who seemed to dominate him, and his arrogant mistreatment towards many early companions such as Abu Dhar al-ghafari, abd-allah ibn Mas'ud and Amar ibn
 Yasir provoked outrage among some groups of people
 adhikansh samrajya main 650-651 ke baad se asantosh or pratirodh khuleam ubhara
 Dissatisfaction with his rule and the governments he appointed was not limited to provinces outside of Arabia
 jab uthman ke rishtedaar, vishesh rup se maaravaan ne us par niyantran praapt kiya, to mahaan parishad, jisamen matadaata parishad ke adhikansh sadsy shaamil the, unke khilaaf ho gaye yaa kam se kam apana samarthan waapas le liya, khalipha par dabaav daalane or apane tareekon ko kam karne ke dabaav daalane apane drudh sambandh kaa prabhaav
 At this time, Ali acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him
 kai avasaron par ali ne udhman ke saath hudud ke aavedan main asahmat; unhone saarvajanik rup se abu dhrar al-ghifaari ke liye sahanubhuti dikhaayi thi or ammar ebn yasir kii raksha main dridhtaa se baat kii thi
 He told Uthman about criticisms of other allies and acted as negotiator on behalf of Uthman with provincial opponents who had come to Medina; This seems to have caused some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family
 aakhirkaar, unhone gheraabandi kii gambhirtha ko apane aagrah se kam karne kii koshish kii ki uthman ko pani kii anumati di jaani chahie
 There is a dispute among historians about the relationship between Ali and Uthman
 haalanki uthman ke prati nishtha kii pratigya karte hue, ali apni kuch nitiyon se asahmat the
 In particular, he clashed with Uthman over the question of religious law
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki ubaayad allaah ebn umr or walid ebn ukba jaise kai maamalon main dharmik sajaa kii jaani chahie
 In 650 during the pilgrimage, he faced Uthman with disdain for the change of prayer ritual
 jab uthman ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah jo kuch bhi use fees se le legaa, to ali ne kaha ki us maamle main khalipha ko majaboor kar diya jayega
 Ali attempted to protect mates from motherhood by a caliph like Ibn Masood
 isliye, kuch itihaaskaar ali ko uthman ke vipaksh ke pramukh sadasyon main se ek maanate hai, yadi mukhya nahin he
 But his decision was rejected due to the fact that Wilferd Madelungis did not have the support of Qureshi to be elected as Khalifa
 unke anusaar, is baat kaa koi saboot nahin he ki ali ke vidrohiyon ke saath ghanishtha sambandh the jinhone apane khalipha kaa samarthan kiya yaa unke kaaryon ko nirdeshit kiya
 Some other sources say that Ali acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him
 haalanki, madelang ne maaravaan ko bataaya ki ali ke pote jain al-abidin ne kaha tha ki Someone was more temperate than your mentor than yours
 muslim itihaas main sabase kathin avadhi main se ek ke dauraan, ali 656 or 661 ke bich khalipha tha, jo ki pehle fitnh ke saath bhi hua tha
 Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polar communal historiography, biographical material is often biased
 lekin sutara is baat se sahamat hai ki vah ek gahan dharmik vyakti tha, jo islam ke kaaran or quran or sunnat ke anusaar nyaay kaa shashan tha; vah dharmik kartavyon ke maamle main musalamaanon ke khilaaf yuddh main lage the
 Sources mention in the notice on their austerity, rigorous observance of religious duties, and separation from worldly goods
 is prakaar kuch lekhakon ne bataaya he ki unhen raajnneetik kaushal or lacheelaapan kii kami he
 Uthman's assassination meant that the rebels had to choose a new caliphate
 yah kathinaaiyon se mulaakaat kii kyonki vidrohiyon ko muhjirun, ansaar, misravasi, kufaan or basrite samet kai samoohon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha 
 There were three candidates: Ali, Talhah and al-zubair
 sabase pehle vidrohiyon ne ali se sampark kiya, chauthe khalif hone ke liye unhen anurodh karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept office, but he turned down the offer, suggesting to be a consultant rather than a chief
 talha, jubayre or anya saathi ne khalipha ke vidrohiyon ke prastaav se inkaar kar diya
 Therefore, the rebels warned the residents of Medina to elect a caliphate within a day, or they would implement drastic action
 dedlock ko hal karne ke liye, muslim al-masjid en- naabavi main 18 june, 656 ko khalipha niyukt karne ke liye ekatra hue 
 Initially, 'ali refused to accept it, as only his most powerful supporters were rebels
 haalanki, jab madina ke nivaasiyon ke alaava mohammad ke kuch ullekhneey saathi ne unhen prastaav sweekaar karne kaa aagrah kiya, to vah antat sahamat hue
 According to Abu Mekhnaf's narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'ali, but other legends claimed otherwise that he was forced to give his vows
 iske alaava, talhah or ez-jubayre ne baad main daawa kiya ki unhone unhen anichhaa se samarthan diya he
 Regardless, Ali rejected these claims, insisting that they recognized them as sloppy
 wilferd madelang kaa maananaa he ki bal ne logon se pratigya dene kaa aagrah nahin kiya or unhone masjid main saarvajanik rup se vachan diya
 While many of the rebels, along with the population of Medina, gave their vows, some important figures or tribes did not
 uthman ke rishtedaar umayyaad levent main bhaag gaye, yaa apane gharon main bane rahe, baad main 'ali kii vaidhata' se inkaar kar diya
 Saad ibn Abi Waqqas was absent and 'abdullah ibn' Umar stopped offering his allegiance, but the two assured 'ali that they would not act against him
 is prakaar ali ne rashidun khaliphot ko viraasat main mila - jo pashchim main misr se purv main irani pahadiyon tak failaa tha- jabaki hejaj or anya praanton kii sthiti main unke chunaav kii purv sandhya par sthiti pareshaan nahin thi
 Soon after becoming Ali Khalifa, he rejected the provincial governors whom Uthman had appointed, replacing them with trusted allies
 unhone mugira ebn shuba or ebn abbaas ke vakil ke khilaaf kaam kiya, jinhone unhen saavdhaanee se apane shashan ke saath aage badhane kii salaah di thi
 Madelung states that Ali was deeply convinced of his authority and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for political expediency, and to fight against overwhelming odds
 uthman ke sansthaapak muvayah pratham or levent ke governor ne ali ke adeshon ko prastut karne se inkaar kar diya; vah aisa karne vaala ekmaatr rajyapal tha
 Ali's name with Islamic calligraphy in Hagia Sophia, when he was appointed Caliph, told the citizens of Medina that Muslim politics had suffered from dissent and controversy; He wanted to purify Islam of any evil
 unhone jansankhya ko sachche muslimon ke rup main vyavhaar karne kii salaah di, chetavanee di ki vah koi rajdroh bardaasht nahin karegaa or jo log vidhvansak gatividhiyon ke doshi paae gaye hai unhen kathor tareeke se niptaya jayega
 Aisha, Talha, al-zubair and the Umayyads, especially Mu'awiyah e and Marvan I, wanted to punish the rioters who had killed 'ali Uthman
 unhone basra ke kareeb deraa daalaa
 The talks lasted for several days and were later sparked by protests during the heated exchange and parley, leading to loss of life on both sides
 bhram main oont kii ladaai 656 main shuru hui, jahaan ali vijayi ho gaya
 Some historians believe that he used the issue to find his political ambitions because he found Ali's caliphate against his advantage
 vidrohiyon ne kaha ki quran or sunnat ke anusaar shashan nahin karne ke liye uthman ko maar daalaa gaya tha, isliye koi pratishodh nahin kiya janaa tha
 Some say that the Khalifa was the gift of the rebels and that Ali did not have enough force to control or punish them, while others say that Ali accepted the rebels' argument or at least did not consider Uthman a ruler
 Ruler
 aisi paristhitiyon main, ek vivaad hua jisane muslim itihaas main pehla grih yuddh shuru kiya
 Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman to be a rightful and just caliph until the end, who was killed illegally
 kuch anya, jinhen ali kii party ke naam se janaa jaataa he, kaa maananaa tha ki uthman galati main gir gaya tha, unhone khalipha ko jabt kar liya tha or kanoonee tareeke se apane tareeke se sudhaarney yaa kadam uthaane ke inkaar karne ke liye kanoon main nishpadit kiya tha; is prakaar ali sirf sahi or sachche imam the or unke virodhiyon main naastik
 This was not Ali's position himself
 is grih yuddh ne muslim samudaay ke bheetar sthaayee vibhaajan banaae, jinke paas khalipha par kabja karne kaa vaid adhikaar tha
 The First Fitna, 656–661, continued after Uthman's assassination, during Ali's caliphate, and was abolished by the Caliph's notion of Mu'awiya
 is grih yuddh islamic ummeh kii praarambhik ekta ke ant ke rup main khed he
 Ali appointed 'abd Allah ibn al-abbas, the governor of Basra and moved his capital to the Muslim garrison city of Kufa in Iraq
 baad roman-farsi yudhon or bijantin saasaani yuddh ki saikadon varshon se chali, vahaan iraq ke bich gahari jaden matbhed, aupchaarik rup se farsi main the sassanid samrajya or syria aupchaarik rup se ke tahat bijantin samrajya
 The Iraqis wanted the newly established Islamic State capital to be in Kufa so that they could bring in revenue to their territory and oppose Syria
 unhone ali ko kupha main aane or iraq main kupha main rajdhani sthapit karne ke liye aashwast kiya
 Later Muawiyah I, the governor of the Levant and cousin of Uthman, refused Ali's demands for loyalty
 ali ne apane nishtha ko waapas paane kii ummiido ko kholaa, lekin muvayah ne apane shashan ke tahat levent swaittata par jor diya
 Muawiyah refused to pay tribute to Ali by mobilizing his Levantine supporters and saying that his party did not participate in his election
 ali ne apni senaaon ko uttar main sthanantarit kar diya or donon senaayen ek sau se adhik dinon tak cyphin main khud ko deraa daale, zyaadaatar samay baatcheet main bitaai gai
 Although Ali exchanged several letters with Mu'awiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuaded him to pledge allegiance
 partiyon ke bich takaraav ne 657 main cyphin kii ladaai kaa netritv kiya
 After a violent battle known as Lalit al-harir after a week of fighting, Mu'awiyah's army was on the point of passage when Amr ibn al-aas advised Mu'awiyah to pounce his troops
 
 ali ne stratage ke madhyam se dekha, lekin keval ek alpsankhyak ladaai kaa peechha karnaa chahta tha
 Eventually the two armies agreed to settle who should be the caliph through mediation
 ladane ke liye ali kii sena main sabase bada block kaa inkaar karnaa madhyasthata kii sweekruti main nirnaayak kaarak tha
 The question is whether the arbitrator will represent Ali or Kufan, with further division in Ali's army
 ashath ebn kyuu or kuch anya ne ali ke ummidavaaron ko 'abd allaah ebn' abbaas or malik al- ashtar ko khaarij kar diya, or abu musa ashaari par apni tatasthta ke liye jor diya
 Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa
 amrit ebn al- e ko muvayah ne madhyasth ke rup main niyukt kiya tha
 Seven months later the two mediators met in Jordan 658, 10 miles northwest of Mann, in Jordan
 amrit ebn al- abu musa ashaari ne aashwast kiya ki ali or muvayah donon ko kadam uthaanaa chahie or ek nayaa khalipha chune jane chahie
 Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision, which reduced the caliphate to the status of rebel Mu'awiyah
 isliye ali ko muvayah or amrit ebn al-es ne bulaayaa tha
 When the arbitrators gathered at daumit-ul-jandal, a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss matters
 jab khalipha ke bare main nirnay lene ke liye samay aayaa, amrit bin al-aas ne abu musa al-ashaari ko is baat kaa manoranjan karne main vishwaas dilaayaa ki unhen khalipha ke ali or muvaaya donon ko vanchit karnaa chahie, or musalamaanon ko chunaav karne kaa adhikaar dena chahie khalipha abu musa al-ashaari ne tadnusaar kaary karne kaa bhi faisla kiya
 According to Punawala, it appears that the arbitrators and other eminent persons met in January 659 to discuss the selection of the new Caliph, with the exclusion of the arbitrators
 amrit ne muvayah kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki abu musa ne apane damaad abdulla ebn umr ko pasand kiya, lekin baad vaale ne sarvasammati se chunaav ke liye khadey hone se inkaar kar diya
 Abu Musa proposed, and Amrit agreed, to leave both Ali and Mu'awiyah and submit a selection of the new Caliph to Shura
 abu musa ke baad saarvajanik ghoshnaa main samjhaute ke apane hisse ko dekha gaya, lekin amrit ne ali ko ghoshit kar diya or muvaaya ko khalipha ke rup main pushti kii
 Ali refused to accept his decision and found it technically in breach of his pledge to hold elections and to follow arbitration
 'ali ne virodh kiya, yah bataate hue ki yah quran or sunnat ke vipareet taur isliye badhyakaari nahin tha
 He then tried to organize a new army, but the Qasr's remnant Ansar, led by Malik Ashtar, and some of his clans remained loyal
 isane ali ko apane samarthakon ke bich bhi ek kamjor sthiti main daal diya
 Mediation resulted in the disintegration of 'ali's alliance, and some have stated that this was Muawiyah's intention
 ali ke shivi main sabase mukhar virodhiyon ne vahi log the jinhone ali ko yudhviram main majaboor kar diya tha
 He broke through Ali's force, rallying under resentment "mediation belongs to God alone
 " is samooh ko kharijiyon ke rup main janaa jane laga
 He considered everyone his enemy
 65 9 main ali kii sena or kharijiyon ne naharvan kii ladaai main mulaakaat kii
 The Qurra then came to be known as Kharijites
 tab kharijiyon ne ali ke samarthakon or anya muslimon kii hatya shuru kar di
 He considered someone who was not part of his group as an unbeliever
 haalanki 'ali ne ek bade antar se ladaai jiti, phir bhi nirantar sangharsh unki sthiti ko prabhavit karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 While dealing with the Iraqis, Ali found it difficult to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions
 unhone kharijiyon se ladane main kaaphi samay bitaayaa
 As a result, 'ali found it difficult to expand the kingdom on its eastern front
 lagbhag usee samay, misr main ashaanti paidaa ho rahi thi
 The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali replaced him with Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr
 muvayah ne misr ko jeetne ke liye 'amrit ebn al' kii anumati di or amrit ne safaltaapurvak aisa kiya
 Amrit first took Egypt eighteen years before the Romans but was dismissed by Uthman
 mohammad ebn abi bakar ke paas misr main koi lokapriy samarthan nahin tha or 2000 purushon ke saath milakar kaamyaab rahe lekin ve bina ladaai ke fail gaye
 In the following years, Mu'awiyah's army captured many cities in Iraq, which Ali's governors could not stop, and the people did not support him to fight with them
 muvayah ne misr, hijaaj, yaman or anya kshetron ko parajeet kiya
 In the last year of Ali's caliphate, the mood in Kufa and Basra changed in their favor as people became confused with Mu'awiyah's reign and policies
 haalanki, ali ke prati logon kaa ravaiya gaharaai se bhinn tha
 Only a small minority of them believed that Ali was the best Muslim after Muhammad and was only entitled to rule over them, while the majority supported him because of his mistrust and opposition to Mu'awiyah
 kaha jaataa he ki ali ne uthman kii maut ke baad khalipha main safal hone ke liye janata dwaara dabaae jane ke baad khalipha ke rankon main vittiya bhrashtachar or anuchit visheshadhikaron ke khilaaf ek asangat abhiyaan kii shapath lee or aagaah kiya
 The Shias argue that despite their unpopularity with the elite, their determination to push these reforms has been a cause of enmity from the rich and privileged former companions of the Prophet
 apane governor malik ashtar ko ek prasiddh patr main, unhone apane samarthak garib virdohi virdohi drushtikon ko vyakt kiya: Remember that dislike and disapproval of ordinary men, acceptance of important persons and resentment of some of the larger ones do not bother more people than imbalances, if the general public and public relations of your subject are happy with you

 baad kii pidiyon kii yaad main ali vafaadaar ke adarsh commander ban gaye
 According to the fake Umayyad Islam claims legitimate sovereignty in Islam as a sub-rule of God, and in the context of Umayyad betrayal, arbitrary and divisive government and vindictive vengeance, they came to appreciate his honesty, his unbearable devotion
 The rule of Islam, his deep personal loyalty, the equal treatment of all his supporters, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies
 afghanistan ke majaari sharif main roj-e-shareef, blue masjid - jahaan musalamaanon kii alpsankhyak maanati he ki ali ebn abu talib ko dafnaaya gaya he
 According to al-sheikh al-mufid, Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently he asked his friends and family to bury him quietly

 Ali is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority
 dharamshastra or exegesis se sulekh or ank vigyaan se vishyon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa, kanoon or rahasyavaad se arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti se ali dwaara pehali baar mana jaataa he
 According to a hadith described by the Shia and Sufis, Muhammad told of them, "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate 


" Muslims consider Ali a major authority in Islam
 shiya ke mutabik, ali ne khud hi yah gavaahi di: There was not a single verse of the Quran but was revealed, which he did not proceed to direct me and read to me
 main ise apane haath se likhuunga, or vah mujhe apane tafaseer or tavil, nasikh ke rup main nirdeshit karegaa or manasmukh, muhakkam or matashabih, vishesh or saamaanya 


 According to Seyed Hossein Nasser, Ali is credited with establishing Islamic theology and his citations include the first rational evidence of the unity of God among Muslims
 ebn abi al-hadeed ne uddhrut kiya he For the sake of doctrine and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art
 is tarah ke kuch bhi unke vishisht aankadon yaa nichle rankon main se kuch ke bich prasaarit nahin kiya gaya tha
 The art was the exclusive preserve of Greece, whose sage was the only extender
 arabon ke bich sauda karne vaala pehla vyakti ali tha
 In later Islamic philosophies, especially in the teachings of Mulla Sadra and his followers, like Alemeh Tabatatei, Ali's stories and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of spiritual knowledge, or divine philosophy
 sadara ke skool ke sadsy ali ko islam ke sarvocch aadhyatmik chikitsak maanate hai
 According to Henry Corbin, Nahj al-balagha can be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines made by Shiite thinkers, especially after 1500
 iskaa prabhaav shabdon ke taarkik samanvay, katautee main mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he sahi nishkarshon ke, or arabi main kuch takneekee sharton kaa nirmaan jo saahitiyik or darshanik bhashaa main swatantra rup se unani granthon ke arabi main anuwaad ke pravesh main pravesh kiya
 In addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as Jafar, Islamic numerology, and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, have been established by Ali, through which he al-jafar and al-jamia
 ali arabi sahitya kaa ek mahaan vidwaan bhi tha or arabi vyakaran or raajnneeti ke kshetra main agrani tha
 Many of Ali's short stories have become part of the general Islamic culture and are cited in daily life as excitement and stories
 ve saahitiyik kaaryon kaa aadhaar bhi ban gaye hai yaa kai bhashaaon main kavy kavita main ekikrut kiye gaye hai
 In the 8th century, literary authorities such as' Abd al-hamid ibn Yahya al-amiri pointed to Ali's unique pronunciation of sermons and stories, as did al-jahiz in the following century
 umayyaad ke divaan ke karmchaariyon ne bhi apane vakprachaar ko sudhaarney ke liye ali ke upadeshon ko padhaa
 The most famous selection of Ali's words and writings is gathered by a 10th-century Shia scholar, al-sharif al-radi, in a book called Nahj al-balgha, who selected him for his singular rhetorical beauty
 pustak main uddhrut upadeshon ke bich note, andekha upadesh ke saath hi alef ke upadesh bhi he
 According to the legends, some of Muhammad's companions were discussing the role of letters in speaking
 unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki bolne main alef kaa sabase bada yogadan tha or bindidaar patr bhi mahatvapurn the
 Meanwhile, Ali read two long impromptu sermons, one according to shell writer Langroudy, without using the letter Aleph and the other without dotted letters, without deep and eloquent concepts
 ek isai lekhak jorge Jordac, ne kaha ki Aleph or dot ke bina upadesh saahitiyik kriti ke rup main mana janaa tha
 Ali is respected for his deep sympathy and support for the poor and orphans, and he pursued similar egalitarian policies during his caliphate with the aim of achieving social justice
 unhen yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he: If God grants wealth and prosperity to any person, then he should show kindness to his worthy kith and kin, provide for the poor, help those who are suffering from disasters, misfortune and the reverse, help the poor And honest people should help in ending their debt


 yah kitaab al- kaaphi main sunai gai he ki amir al-muminine ali ebn abi talib ko baghdad ke paas sthanon se shahad or anjir ke saath prastut kiya gaya tha
 Upon receiving the gift, he ordered his officers to bring the orphans so that they could lick the honey from the containers while he rested himself among the people
 nahaj al-balgha main ali ke liye jimmedaar bolne vaale upadesh, patr or uddhran shaamil hai jinhen raakh-sharif aar-radio dwaara sankalit kiya gaya he
 Reza Shah Kazemi states: "despite ongoing questions about the authenticity of the text, recent scholarship suggests that much of the material in it may actually be attributed to Ali" and in support of an article by Mokhtar Jebali Gives reference
 arabi sahitya main is pustak kii ek pramukh sthiti he
 It is also considered an important intellectual, political and religious work in Islam

 Masadir Nahj al-balagha wa Asanidah, written by al-sayyid ‘abd al-zahra’ al-husayn al-khatib, offers some of these sources
 iske alaava, mohammad baqir al- mahamudi dwaara nahaj al-saadah faai mastadra nahaj al-balaghah ali ke maujuuda bhaashanon, upadeshon, niyamon, patron, prarthanaaon or ekatrit hone vaale kahaniyon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he

 puure islamic itihaas main ali kaa prabhaav mahatvapurn rahaa he
 Sunni and Shia scholars agree that the verse of Wilayah was recited in honor of Ali, but Wilayah and Imamate have different interpretations
 sunni vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki kavita ali ke bare main he, lekin unhen shiya muslim vichaar main, imam ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa jaataa he, ali ko bhagwaan dwaara mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main chunaa gaya tha
 There are several verses interpreted by Shia scholars referring to Ali or other Shia Imams
 is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue ki quran main imam ke naamon kaa ullekh kyon nahin kiya gaya he, mohammad al-baqir uttar dete hai: "allaah ne apane paigambar ko salaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin teen yaa chaar rakaton ke bare main kabhi nahin kaha, jakaat kaa khulaasa kiya lekin iske vivaranon kaa zikr nahin kiya haj lekin iske tawaaf or paigambar kii ginati nahin hui thi 
 He revealed this verse and the Prophet said that this verse is about Ali, Hasan, Hussain and the twelve Imams
 " ali ke anusaar kuranik chhandon kii ek chauthai imam ke stesan ko bataa rahi he
 Mammen lists many of these verses in his introduction to Shia Islam
 haalanki, kuch chand hai ki kuch sunni tippaneekar ali ke sandarbh main vyakhya karte hai, jinamein se vilaah kii kavita he ki sunni or shiya vidwaan is ghatana ko sanderbhit karte hai ali ne apni anguthi ko ek bhikhaari ko diya jisane masjid main anushthan prarthana karte hue bhakton se poocha
 Mavadda's poem is one of the verses, both Sunni and Shiite associated Ali's name with some other names
 mubahaalaa kii uparokt kavita, or yah bhi pad 2: 26 9 jisamen ali ko shiya or sunni donon tippaneekaron dwaara adwitiya gyaan ke saath sammanit kiya jaataa he is tarah ke chand
 The Shia consider Ali the most important person after Muhammad and he represents a complex, mythological figure in his memory
 vah gunon kaa ek paragon he, jaise saahas, mahanata, eemaandaaree, sidhaapan, vakprachaar or gahan gyaan
 Ali was righteous but faced injustice, he was authoritative but kind and courteous, vigorous but also patient, learned but also a laboring man
 shiya ke anusaar, mohammad ne apane jeevankaal ke dauraan vibhinn avasaron par suzav diya ki unki mrityu ke baad ali musalamaanon kaa netaa hona chahie
 It is supported by many hadiths, narrated by Shams, including the Hadith of the pond of Khum, the Hadiths of two weighty things, the Hadiths of pen and paper, the Hadiths of the Cloak, the Hadiths of the post, the invitation of the Nimath close family, and the twelve successors The Hadith
 jafar al-sadik haddees main varnan karata he ki mohammad main jo bhi gun paaya gaya vah ali main paaya gaya tha, jo uske maargdarshan se dur hokar allaah or uske paigambar se dur ho jayega
 Ali himself describes that he is the gateway and overseer to reach Allah
 is drushtikon ke anusaar, mohammad ke uttaradhikari ke rup main ali ne nyaay main samudaay par shashan nahin kiya, balki sharia kanoon or iske gudh arth kaa bhi arth diya

 yah twailvar or ismali shi islam main mana jaataa he ki 'ekl, divine gyaan, bhavishyavaktaaon or imaamon kii atmaaon kaa strot tha or unhen goom naamak gudh gyaan diya gaya tha or unke dukh unke bhakton ko divya krupa kaa saadhan the

 islamic vidwaanon ke bahumat se unhen gulaat ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 According to traditional Muslims, Islam has been abandoned in these groups because of the exaggeration of human admirable qualities
 main ali-illahism, ek samadharmi vishwaas kiya gaya lagaataar vahaan he par dharm kendron avatar unke ke devtaa puure itihaas main, or bhandar 'ali, mohammad kaa betaa ji ne aise hi ek avatar mana jaataa he ke liye vishesh rup se shraddha

 Extensive secondary sources include the writings of Sunni and Shea Muslims, Christian Arabs, Hindus, and other non-muslims from the Middle East and Asia, and in addition to some works by modern Western scholars
 haalanki, shuruaati islamic sroton main se kuch ali kii taraf sakaaratmak yaa nakaaratmak purvaagrah se kuch had tak rangeen hai
 Against these assertions there had previously been a common trend among Western scholars and there were reports collected in later periods due to the tendency towards Sunni and Shea biased positions; Later such scholars about him as texture
 isse unhen kuch report kiye gaye kaaryakramon ko anaupchaarik yaa apraasangik mana jaataa he

 According to him, Kaitani's approach is inconsistent

 April 2009–present The Porsche Panamera is a four-door, four-seat luxury vehicle with a coupe profile and a rear hatch
 iskaa ingine saamne kii ore hota he, yah rier-wheel drive se yukt he, iskaa chaar-pahiyon vaala drive sanskaran bhi uplabdh he
 The production model of the Porsche Panamera was unveiled in April 2009 at the 13th Auto Shanghai International Automobile Show in Shanghai, China
 sitambar 2010 main, porsh ne ghoshnaa kii ki, isane bazaar main car ke aane ke pehle hi saal main 25000 se zyada panamera kaaron kaa utpaadan kar liya tha, jabaki prarambh main 2 xxrep 4 0 vaahanon ke utpaadan kaa hi anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 Already 22,518 cars have been distributed to customers all over the world, its most popular market has been in the United States and the most popular vehicle in this range is the Panamera 4S
 panamera ke naam kii vyutpatti karera panamericana res se, porsh karera line kii tarah hui he
 The Panamera is generally considered to have been the fruit of the Porsche 989 concept since the 1980s, after a long wait; Some argue that it also presents itself as a follow-up to the two-door 928 but there may be plans for a new 928 development
 porsh panamera or panamera es kaa vipanan phul-saise kii lakjri kaaron jaise bi em dablyoo 7 series or marcedes-benz es-varg ke ek pratyaksh pratispardhi ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Like the Porsche Cayenne SUV, the Panamera upset many enthusiasts about the Porsche, as it was seen as an attempt to broaden Porsche's appeal beyond hardcore fans
 panamera company kii peshkash ke vipareet chali, vishesh rup se isaki halki do daravaajon kii rier ingine vaali sports kaaren jaise 911
 Despite the variations in dimensions and design, one reviewer stated that the Panamera's driving dynamics are close to the 911 and "seem to make its way between really good sports cars and suitable sports cars" and furthermore the Panamera has Has won every comparative test against other four-door cars in the market

 However, UN car magazine has not described the s model as sporty as they expected, alleging that the car is "as far as possible oriented toward comfort"
 or terbo model ko "porsh ke sabandh main ek chook gaya avasar" kaha he jo "duniya kii pehle halake vajan kii chaar seater" he chunki sheersh ke model kaa vajan audi es8 ke kareeb he
 The engine was first housed in Stuttgart and the car body was made and painted at the Volkswagen Group facility in Hanover

 dianemic host kanfigareshan protocol upkarnon dwaara prayukt hone vaala computer netwarking protocol he jo gantavy host par ai pi adress ko dianemic dhang se vitarit karata he
 In October 1993, RFC 1531 defined DHCP as a standard track protocol after the Bootstrap protocol
 1997 main jari kiya gaya aglaa apadet RFC 2131, internet protocol sanskaran 4 network ke liye diechasipi kii vartmaan paribhaasha he
 Extensions for dhcp's ipv6 were published in RFC 3315
 BGP · DHCP · DNS · FTP · HTTP · IMAP · IRC · LDAP · MGCP · NNTP · NTP · POP · RIP · RPC · RTP · SIP · SMTP · SNMP · SOCKS · SSH · Telnet · TLS / SSL · XMPP · TCP · UDP · DCCP · SCTP · RSVP · ECN · IP · ICMP · icmpv6 · IGMP · ipsec · The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol automatically determines network-parameters for network devices of one or more fault-tolerant-dhcp servers
 yahaan tak ki chote network main, diechasipi upyogi he kyonki yah network main nai mashiinon ko jodna aasaan bana saktaa he
 When a dhcp-configured client connects to a network, the DHCP client sends a broadcast query to the DHCP server for the required information
 diechasipi sarwar IP adress or client concigareshan parameter kii jaankariyon kaa ek samooh ekatrit karata he jaise ki difolt getwe, domen naam, DNS sarwar anya sarwar jaise time sarwar, or duusare
 ek vaid anurodh praapt hone par, sarwar computer ko ek ypi adress, ek leez or anya ypi concigareshan parameter jaise ki sabanet mask or difolt getwe nirdisht karata he
 The query usually starts immediately after booting and must be completed before the client begins IP based communication with the other hosts
 karyanvayan ke aadhaar par, diechasipi sarwar teen tareekon se ypi aabantan kar sakate hai: DHCP uses the same two ports specified by IANA for BOOTP: 67 / udp for the server side and 68 / udp for the client side
 diechasipi aaparishan ke chaar buniyadi charan hai : ypi khoj, ypi leez prastaav, ypi anurodh or ypi leez sweekruti
 The client transmits the message to find the DHCP server available on the physical subnet
 network administrator ek sthaneey router ko ek alag sabanet se diechasipi ke packet ko ek DHCP sarwar par aage bhejne ke liye configar kar sakate hai
 This action performed by the client results in a user datagram protocol packet with 255
255
255
255 or a specific subnet broadcast address
 ek diechasipi client apane pichley gyaat ypi pate ke liye bhi anurodh kar saktaa he
 If the client remains connected to the network for which this IP is valid, the server can accept the request
 anyathaa, yah nirbhar karata he ki sarwar ko adhikrut rup main set kiya gaya he yaa nahin
 An authoritative server will reject the request, prompting the client to immediately ask for a new IP address
 a non-authoritative server simply ignores the request, allowing the client time dependent on the implementation to send a new request and ask for a new IP address
 anurodh sabanet mask, router, domen naam, When a DHCP server receives an IP lease request from a client, it reserves an IP address for the client and offers an IP lease by sending a DHCP OFFER message to the client
 is sandesh main client kaa mike adress, sarwar dwaara prastaavit ypi adress, sabanet mask, leez kii avadhi or prastaav bhejne vaale sarwar kaa ypi adress hota he
 The server determines the configuration based on the hardware address of the client specified in the CHADDR field
 yahan sarwar 192
168
1
1, YIADDR field main main ypi pataa nirdisht karata he
 a client can receive a DHCP offer from multiple servers, but it will only accept a DHCP offer and broadcast a DHCP request message
 anurodh main transection idi field ke aadhaar par, sarvaron ko yah suchit kiya jaataa he ki kiskaa prastaav client ne sweekaar kar liya he
 When other DHCP servers receive this message, they can withdraw any offer made to the client and send the proposed address to the available IP pool
 jab diechasipi sarwar client se diechasipineshapuaishth sandesh praapt karata he, concigareshan prakriya apane antim charan main pravesh karti he
 In the acceptance phase a DHCP ACK packet is sent to the client
 is packet main leez kii avadhi or client dwaara poochi ja sakane vaali anya concigareshan sambandhit jaankaree shaamil hoti he
 At this point, the IP configuration process is complete
 protocol diechasipi client se sahamat maanakon ke anuroop apane network interphes ko configar karne kii ummid karata he
 After the client receives an IP address, the client can use the address resolution protocol to avoid IP related conflicts arising due to overlapping of address storage by DHCP servers
 ek diechasipi client sarwar dwaara di gayi mul diechasipigauteaish jaankaree ke alaava or adhik jaankaree ke liye anurodh kar saktaa he
 The client can also request to resend data for a particular application
 udhaaharan ke liye, brouzar WPAD ke dwaara web proxi settings ko praapt karne ke liye diechasipi inform kaa prayog karte hai
 Such requests do not refresh the IP expiry time in the DHCP server in its database
 client diechasipi sarwar se DHCP soochna jari karne ke liye anurodh bhejtaa he or client apana ypi adress dactivet / niskriy kar detaa he
 Since client devices generally do not know when users can remove them from the network, the protocol does not support sending DHCP releases
 ek diechasipi sarwar client ke liye vaikalpik concigareshan parameter pradaan kar sakate hai
 RFC 2132 Internet Assigned Number Authority - describes the available DHCP options defined by the DHCP and BOOTP parameters
 ek diechasipi client diechasipi sarwar ke dwaara uplabdh karaae gaye paramitaron ko chun saktaa he, uname herpher kar saktaa he or unhen overrit kar saktaa he
 The option exists to identify the vendor and to know the functionality of a DHCP client
 jaankaree vibhinn lambaai kii kairactor string yaa octats ke rup main ho sakati he jiskaa arth diechasipi client ke vendor dwaara nirdisht hota he
 One method that DHCP clients use to establish a connection to a server is to use a special type of hardware or firmware to set a value in their DHCP request called a vendor class identifier
 yah paddati diechasipi sarwar ko do prakaar kii client mashiinon main antar karne ke liye sakasham banaati he or uchit dhang se do prakaar ke modem se anurodh ko kriyanvit karti he
 Some set-top boxes also set the VCI to inform the DHCP server about the type of hardware and the functionality of the device
 is vikalp dwaara set kii gayi vailu diechasipi sarwar ko kisi bhi atirikt jaankaree kii aavashyaktaa ke liye sanket detii he jise client ek diechasipi pratikriya main chahta he
 In small networks DHCP usually uses broadcast
 haalanki, kuch paristhitiyon main, unicast adress kaa prayog kiya jayega, udhaaharan ke liye: jab network main ek single diechasipi sarwar ho jo ek se adhik sabanet ke liye ypi adress pradaan karata he
 When a router for such a subnet receives a DHCP broadcast, it converts it to unicast
 
 The GIADDR field of this modified request is sent to the interface of the router on which it received the original DHCP request
 DHCP sarwar GIADDR field kaa upyog mul upkaran ke sabanet kii pahchaan ke liye karata he taaki yah sahi pool se ek ypi adress chun sake
 The DHCP server then sends the DHCP OFFER back to the router via unicast
 iske baad router diechasipi OFFER ko ek prasaaran main badalata he or ise mul upkaran ke interphes par bhej detaa he
 Template: Close paraphrase network suraksha ke ek mahatvapurn mudda banane se pehle hi buniyadi diechasipi protocol ek maanak ban gaya he: isamen koi suraksha visheshtaayen shaamil nahin hai or is par do prakaar ke sambhavit hamale ho sakate hai: To combat these threats, RFC 3118 introduced authentication information in DHCP messages, which allowed clients and servers to reject information received from illegal sources
 haalanki is protocol kaa samarthan vyapak he, client or sarvaron kii ek badi sankhya abhi bhi pramanikaran kaa puri tarah se samarthan nahin kar rahi he, jisase sarvaron ko un clienton kaa samarthan karne ke liye majboor hona pad rahaa he jo is suvidha kaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 As a result, other security measures are typically implemented in DHCP servers to ensure that only authenticated clients and servers have access to the network
 adress DNS sarwar se dianemic rup se jude hone chahiyein, taaki samasya kaa nivaaran ek sambhavit agyaat adress ke bajaay naam dwaara ho
 Effective DHCP-DNS links require a MAC address or local name sent to the DNS that is specific to the physical host, IP address, and other parameters such as the default gateway, subnet mask, and IP address of the DNS server from the DHCP server Identifies
 diechasipi sarwar sunishchit karata he ki sabhi IP adress alag hon, arthath jab tak pehle client kaa asinment vaid he tab tak ypi adress duusare client ko nahin saunpa jaae
 is prakaar ypi adress pool prabandhan ek sarwar dwaara kiya jaataa he naa ki ek administrator dwaara

 Thus the description of Thakur's procession helps to solidify inhumanity

 Because in a society in which the condition of day-to-day workers was not much better than their condition and those who knew how to benefit from the weaknesses of the farmers were much more prosperous than the farmers, there was this kind of attitude Being born was not surprising

 Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in Allahabad, British India
 unke pita, motilal nehru, ek dhani barrister jo kashmiri pandit samudaay se the, swatantrata sangram ke dauraan bhartiya rashtriya congress ke do baar adhyaksh chune gaye
 His mother Swarooprani Thusu, from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore, was Motilal's second wife and the first wife died during childbirth
 jawaharlal teen bacchon main se sabase bade the, jinamein baaki do ladkiyaan thi
 The elder sister, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly

 Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in some of the best schools and universities in the world
 unhone apni schuli shiksha hero se or college kii shiksha trinity college, cambridge se puri kii thi
 He then completed his law degree from Cambridge University
 england main unhone saat saal vyateet kiye jisamen vahaan ke fabian samaajwaad or irish rashtrawaad ke liye ek tarksangat drushtikon viksit kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru returned to India in 1912 and started advocacy
 1916 main unki shaadi kamala nehru se hui
 Jawaharlal Nehru joined the Home Rule League in 1917
 raajnneeti main unki asli diksha do saal baad 1919 main hui jab ve mahatma gandhi ke sampark main aae
 At that time Mahatma Gandhi launched a campaign against the Rowlatt Act
 nehru, mahatma gandhi ke sakriy lekin shantipurna, savinay avagya andolan ke prati khaase aakarshith hue
 Nehru also adapted his family according to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi
 jawaharlal or motilal nehru ne pashchimi kapadon or mahangi sampatti kaa tyaag kar diya
 He now started wearing a Khadi kurta and Gandhi cap
 jawahar laal nehru ne 1920-1922 main asahyog andolan main sakriy hissaa liya or is dauraan pehali baar giraftaar kiye gaye
 He was released after a few months
 jawaharlal nehru 1924 main elahabaad nagar nigam ke adhyaksh chune gaye or unhone shahar ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ke rup main do varsh tak seva kii
 He resigned in 1926 citing lack of cooperation from the British authorities
 1926 se 1928 tak, jawahar laal nehru ne akhil bhartiya congress samiti ke mahasachiv ke rup main seva kii
 In 1928-29, the annual session of the Congress was held under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 us satr main jawaharlal nehru or subhash chandra bose ne puri raajnneetik swatantraaa kii maang kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki motilal nehru or anya netaaon ne british samrajya ke bheetar hi prabhutv sampann rajya kaa darja paane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya
 To resolve the issue, Gandhi took a middle ground and said that Britain would be given two years to grant the status of the state of India and if it did not, the Congress would launch a national struggle for complete political independence
 nehru or bose ne maang kii ki is samay ko kam kar ke ek saal kar diya jaae
 The British government did not respond to this
 disambar 1929 main, congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan lahore main yojit kiya gaya jisamen jawaharlal nehru congress party ke adhyaksh chune gaye
 During this session, a resolution was also passed demanding 'complete self-rule'
 26 janvari 1930 ko lahore main jawaharlal nehru ne swatantra bharat kaa jhanda fahraaya
 Gandhiji also called for the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930
 andolan khaasaa safal rahaa or isane british sarkaar ko pramukh raajnneetik sudhaaron kii aavashyaktaa ko sweekaar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 When the British Government promulgated the India Act 1935, the Congress Party decided to contest elections
 nehru chunaav ke baahar rahe lekin zoron ke saath party ke liye rashtravyapee abhiyaan chalaaya
 The Congress formed governments in almost every province and won the largest number of seats in the Central Assembly
 nehru congress ke adhyaksh pad ke liye 1936 or 1937 main chune gaye the
 He was also arrested during the Quit India Movement in 1942 and released in 1945
 1947 main bharat or pakistan kii aazaadee ke samay unhone angreji sarkaar ke saath hui vaartaon main mahatvapurn bhagidaari kii
 When India got independence in 1947, when the Congress voted for the future Prime Minister, Sardar Patel got the most votes
 uske baad sarvaadhik mat acharya kriplani ko mili the
 But at the behest of Gandhiji, Sardar Patel and Acharya Kripalani withdrew their names and Jawaharlal Nehru was made the Prime Minister
 1947 main ve swatantra bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri bane
 The British had liberated around 500 princely states together and the biggest challenge at that time was to bring them under one flag
 unhone bharat ke punargathan ke raste main ubhari har chunauti kaa samajhadaari purvak saamana kiya
 Jawaharlal Nehru played an important role in the making of modern India
 unhone yojana ayog kaa gathan kiya, vigyaan or praudyogiki ke vikaas ko protsaahit kiya or teen lagaataar panchavarshiya yojanaon kaa shubharambh kiya
 Due to their policies, a new era of agriculture and industry started in the country
 nehru ne bharat kii videsh niti ke vikaas main ek pramukh bhoomika nibhaai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, together with Josip Burrows Tito and Abdul Gamal Nasir, created a non-aligned movement for the elimination of colonialism in Asia and Africa
 vah korian yuddh kaa ant karne, suez nahar vivaad sulajhane or congou samjhaute ko murtarup dene jaise anya antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan main madhyasth kii bhoomika main rahe
 He also contributed significantly behind the scenes in resolving many other explosive issues like West Berlin, Austria and Laos
 unhen varsh 1955 main bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya
 But Nehru could not improve India's relations with Pakistan and China
 pakistan ke saath ek samjhaute tak pahunchne main kashmir mudda or china ke saath mitrataa main seemaa vivaad raste ke pathar sabit hue
 Nehru also extended a hand of friendship towards China, but in 1962, China attacked by deception
 nehru ke liye yah ek bada jhatka tha or shaayad unki maut bhi isi kaaran hui
 On 27 May 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru suffered a heart attack in which he died
 bahut se logon kaa vichaar he ki nehru ne anya netaaon kii tulana main bharat ke swatantrata sangram main bahut kam yogadan diya tha phir bhi gandhiji ne unhe bharat kaa pratham pradhanmantri bana diya
 For several decades after independence, the heirs of power in Indian democracy have run a monarchy in the country from time to time, revered individual worship in place of ideology and completely neglected the public interest while indulging in the aura of so-called popularity
 nehru ko mahatma gandhi ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari ke taur janaa jaataa he
 It is also alleged on Gandhi that he did the work of advancing Nehru in politics at the expense of many able leaders including Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 jab aazaadee ke thik pehle congress adhyaksh banane kii baat thi or mana ja rahaa tha ki jo congress adhyaksh banegaa vahi aaazaad bharat kaa pehla pradhanmantri hoga tab bhi gandhi ne pradesh congress samitiyon kii siforeeshon ko andekha karte hue nehru ko hi adhyaksh banane kii disha main safaltaapurvak prayaas kiya
 This creates a general belief that Nehru must have not only done the work of advancing the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi but he must have tried his best to complete the tasks which Gandhi himself could not complete
 lekin sachai iske ulat he
 It was none other than Jayaprakash Narayan, who once worked as a team with Nehru, in the role of 1978 book 'gandhi Today'
 jepi ne nehru ke bare main kuch kaha he to uski vishwasaneeyata ko lekar koi andeh nahin hona chahie kyonki nehru se jepi kii najdiki bhi thi or mitrataa bhi
 Despite this, JP highlighted the shortcomings of the Nehru model
 april 2015 main yah bhi khulaasa hua ki swatantraaa ke baad nehru ne bees varshon tak ibi dwaara netaji ke sambandhiyon kii jasusi karaayi
 Away from all political controversies, Nehru was undoubtedly a good writer
 raajnneetik kshetra main lokmaanya tilak ke baad jam kar likhane vaale netaaon main ve alag se pahachaane jate hai
 The areas of both are different, but there is a considerable amount of consistency in the writing of both
 nehru ji swabhaav se hi swadhyaayi the
 He studied great texts
 sabhi rajnatik uttejnaaon ke baavjood ve swadhyay ke liye roj hi samay nikaal liya karte the
 As a result, the books composed by him also give a simple feeling of being the creation of a study-able person
 nehru ji ne vyavasthit rup se anek pustakon kii rachana kii he
 The solution to the extreme lack of time for writing in the busiest struggling days of political life was to make the long dull days of jail a creative one
 isliye unki adhikansh pustaken jail main hi likhi gayi hai
 In his writings, a mixed form of the spirit of a litterateur and the searching heart of a historian has emerged
 indira gandhi ko kaalpanik patr likhane ke bahaane unhone vishwa itihaas kaa adhyay-dar-adhyay likh daalaa
 These letters were never actually sent, but by this, a simple communicative and well-written text like a glimpse of world history was easily prepared
 bharat kii khoj ne lokapriyata ke alag pratimaan rache hai, jis par aadhaarit bharat ek khoj naam se ek uttam dharawahik kaa nirmaan bhi hua he
 His autobiography About my story, the well-known Manishi Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan believes that his autobiography, which narrates the story of his life and struggle without trying to prove self-pity or moral superiority, is one of the most notable books of our era
 Is one of in pustakon ke atirikt nehru ji ne aganit vyaakhyaan diye, lekh likhe tathaa patr likhe
 For their publication, 'jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund' decided to publish a bibliography

 Dental reabsorption is the problem of teeth in which the structure of teeth deteriorates due to innate ability
 daant avasorana 2 prakaar ke hote hai- aantarik punahshoshan or bahya punahshoshan

 External reabsorption is the problem of teeth in which the absorption of teeth reaches the teeth through the root surface

 Hazariprasad Dwivedi has said about the plot stereotypes abhipraay kii paribhaasha dete hue shiple ne bataaya he, This is the general definition of intent, as it is used in different ways in different colors, and each color has its own different meanings
 at: yahan abhipraay ke bare main vichaar kar lenaa samichin rahegaa
 Many traditional acts or rules are considered to be trends or stereotypes due to the constant support of public confidence
 inke vaastavik arth yaa mul taatpary kaa pataa kisi ko nahin hota, to bhi vishesh avasaron par log inkaa paalan karte hi hai
 By not adhering to many of these, where there is only the possibility of social disharmony, there are also some trends that if not fulfilled there is a fear of divine calamities or various kinds of losses
 kuch roodhiyaan is prakaar kii bhi hoti hai jinhen chhod dene par na to pratishtha ko kisi prakaar kaa dhakka lagata he or na hi jinka paalan na karne se kisi daivi vipatti kii ashanka rahati he
 Even when the opportunity is present, people follow them mechanically from generation to generation
 janm, maran, vivaah, putrotpatti tathaa anyaanya punya avasaron evam vidhi sanskaron ke samay kiye janevaale vibhinn krityon ko inke antargat gina ja saktaa he
 In western Uttar Pradesh, a widower is married to an orchard before the girl so that even if there is a law for the death of that person's second wife, the orchard is destroyed in his place, not a new bride
 vivaah ke avasar par varyatra ke samay var kii mata kuen main pair latakaakar baith jaati he or vahaan se vah tabhi hilti he jab uskaa putr uske doodh kaa mulya chukaa detaa he
 Perhaps behind this trend only after winning the war, the remnant of the medieval feudal practice of acquiring a girl is working according to which the mother promised to the son before marriage that he would return with the bride, not empty handed
 
 in sabhi roodhiyon yaa chalanon ko "saamaajik parampara' kii sangya di ja sakati he
 Like this social tradition, some ideas are used from time to time in the areas of music, art and literature or poetry
 prayog dhire-dhire chalan kaa rup dhaaran karke rudhigat ho jate hai, to bhi inkaa abhipraayapaksh mukhar rahata he or inhen roodhi se kuch vishisht paramparaagat abhipraayon ke rup main hi sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 Hazariprasad Dwivedi's appropriate definition of storyline orthodoxy states three things
 pratham yah ki sambhaavnaaon par bal dene ke kaaran kathabhipraayon kaa janm hota he
 In this context, it can be said that plot concepts are often used to present adventures, miracles and ancient images and environments
 at: unamem asambhav, asaadhaaran, aswabhaavik or kabhi-kabhi alokik tatwon kaa samavesh bhi kar diya jaataa he
 But, at the core of these plot conventions, only the imagined imagination is working more
 udaahranarth, "kisi rakshas yaa yaksha dwaara nayak yaa nayika ko lekar ud janaa' main atipraakrit shakti ke prati vishwaas kii jhalak sabal he
 If a bird can fly a small animal with a beak, then why can't it fly with a powerful Yaksha or a demon hero or heroine? At least there is a possibility, then why not use it for adventures and miracles

 In the later period, though cultural sophistication, some of the scripts fell behind the motive or their forms changed drastically, however, as proved by ethnographic research that even after reaching human advanced cultural stage, due to its strong conception power , Is unable to discard the primitive remnants — these plot stereotypes, myths, folklore, Nishandari narratives and c Remained undone in practices and that's where she is admitted in polite literature
 saanskrithik utthan or parishkar ke saath nai kathanak roodhiyon kaa nirmaan bhi hua
 As new customs, beliefs, beliefs, etc
 were established in the era, scriptures related to religion, Ayurveda, astrology, Shakuna, Tantra mantra, Kama etc
 were created, as well as new story traditions
 He was born and started to be used extensively in everything from folklore to elegant literature
 doosraa sutara he– "kathanak ko gati or ghumaav dene ke liye in abhipraayon kaa prayog hota he
 In the plot, the movement of time opens the event and at the same time its event combination is based on rational work-cause-end-relations in line with the rational composition of the world
 kathantargat is ghatnavali ko kholane kaa arth katha ko gati dena hi he or isamen kathanak abhipraayon kaa pramukh haath rahata he
 For example, an idea called "upashruti" can be taken
 priya kii khoj main niklaa hua nayak jab jangal main bhatak jaataa he to katha ko aage badhaane kaa maarg bhi avaruddh ho jaataa he
 On such an occasion, the story is given impetus by using the epithet called "upashruti" or any other similar plot
 kisi vriksh ke neeche athwa kotor main leta hua niraash premi vriksh ke upar baithe pakshiyugal kii baatcheet athwa pakshi-samooh ko kisi ek pakshi dwaara kisi katha ke sunaae jane ke bich koi aisi soochna paa jaataa he ki use apane priya se milane kaa tarika maaloom ho jaataa he yaa yah vishwaas ho jaataa he ki vah apni priya ko avashya hi praapt kar sakegaa
 Sometimes the speaker bird is going to go to the same place itself the next morning where the hero has to reach and then with great skill, the hero hides in the tail of the bird and reaches the intended site
 kathanak ko ghumaav yaa nayaa mode dene ke sandarbh main "stri kii dohad kaamana' ko liya ja saktaa he
 The word "dohad" is derived from "biphrid"
 aapnnsatva nari kii dohadakamana stri ke jivan kii ati saamaanya evam parichit ghatana he
 In this situation, the woman sometimes expresses a desire to eat sour sweet and sometimes her heart becomes anxious to eat the burnt clay of the stove
 pati garbhvatee patni kii prayek ichha puri karne ke liye tatpar rahata he or uski dohadakamana ko purna karnaa apana param kartavya samajhataa he
 The narrators have taken this miracle as a motive and have done its miraculous and wonderful experiments in various ways on various occasions and Jain storytellers had made it their most beloved motive
 har arhat athwa chakravartin kii utpatti ke purv uski mata koi pavitra or shreshth kaary karne kii dohadakamana karti dikhaai padati he
 "samaraditya Abbreviation" and "samaraichha Kaha" composed in Prakrit language based on it, almost all pregnant women express their wishes on the occasions of rebirth of prominent elites
 anya anek kathaon main bhi katha ko nayaa mode dene ke liye nayikaaye chandrapan karne, kii, pati ke rakt main snaan karne kii athwa kisi raktavapi main snaan karne kii ichha vyakt karti dekhi jaati hai
 Nayak gets Priya bathed in it by making artificial blood pressure
 vaapi se baahar nikalne par upar se neeche tak raktasnaat stri ko akaash main mandraata koi bharund, garud, athwa giddh mansapind samajhakar chonch main dabaakar uda le jaataa he
 The hero then has to make many efforts to get it
 kahin rakshason se muthbhed hoti he to kahin kisi mantravid se nipatna padataa he or ant main vah patni ko paa letaa he
 In this way, the plot does not only come out after getting a new direction, it also attracts many exciting and amazing events
 keval yaheen nahin katha aarambh karne evam usko chamatkaarik dhang se samaapt karne main bhi in kathanak abhipraayon se paryaapt sahaayta lee jaati he
 a swan or a shook gets into the hands of the hero and describes the beauty of a beautiful beauty and makes it romantic
 premika ko paane ke liye nayak yogivesh main nikal padataa he
 In this way, the story begins, which becomes progressively curious and curious
 katha kaa chamatkaarik ant karne ke liye bahut baar nayak kii anupasthiti main kisi manachale athwa vishayi raja yaa rajkumaar kii ore se koi kuttani nayika ke paas bhej di jaati he
 But the heroine does not turn away from the truth
 nayak ke laut aane par vah ukt ghatana use sunaati he jisase aagbubala hokar nayak pratidwandvi se yuddh thaan detaa he or samarangan main shatru ko maarane main itnaa ghayal ho jaataa he ki uske swayan ke praan bhi nahin bachate or nayika uske shav ke saath sati ho jaati he
 There is also the ability to compose the whole story in some ideas like per-entry
 dvivedi ji ke uparyukt kathan se teesraa sutara yah praapt hota he ki "dirghakaal se vyavahrut honevaale ye abhipraay thodi dur tak yatharth hote hai or aage chalakar kathanak roodhiyon main badal jate hai
 'A cursory look at the lines presented gives the impression that "plot intent" and "plot stereotype" are differentiators
 kintu jaraa gahare paithne par yah bhram chhin-bhinn ho jaataa he, kyonki aarambh main kisi bhi abhipraay kaa prayog kisi vishesh uddeshy ko lekar kiya jaataa he or aisa karte samay ukt abhipraay ke mul main vaastaviktaa kii koi na koi maatra avashya rahati he
 After the combination of imagination, the said intention gets progressively such that the amount of the cosmic element in it becomes sufficiently sparse but its prospect is still sufficiently vocal and the creator is desirous of the above mentioned opportunities due to his simile tendency to remain true to truthful inquiry
 Keeps using it for the purpose
 isi str par kathanak abhipraay kathanak roodhi main badal jaataa he lekin iskaa arth yah nahin he ki kathanak roodhi maatr roodhi hokar rah jaati he
 As with plot intent, storyline stereotypes are also fully active, with no difference in their ability to advance the narrative or narrative, to give it a new twist or to end it in a magical way
 is drushti se ye donon ek duusare ke paryaay rahete hai
 In naming "plot intent" as "plot stereotype", all that remains is to make it clear that it is also used on the basis of practice or tradition
 udaahranarth, hans, kapot, shuk aadi ke pair yaa greeva main patr baandhakar priy athwa priya ke paas sandesh bhejne ke anek pramaan milte hai
 So, initially the storytellers must have used it as a motive
 pashchaat shukadi dwaara thodaa bahut maanavvaani kaa anukaran kar lene kii kshamta ke aadhaar par sambhaavna kaa sahaara lekar bahut se pakshiyon ko maanavvaani main moulik sandeshwah ke rup main dikhaaya jane laga
 Not only this, there was no hesitation in using them as scribes, vocal pundits and counselors in the future
 jaaysi krit padmavat kaa "hiraaman' shuk pramaan he
 In conclusion, even after being realistic in the beginning, the idea of "messenger bird", after being used for a long time, not only went away from reality, but also used it as a messenger, lovemaking, guide among every loving girlfriend
 - Began to be done
 yahi baat anya sabhi abhipraayon ke liye bhi satya he
 Because of following this usage convention, there is no impropriety in calling "plot intent" as "plot concept"
 kathanak roodhi jahaan kathanak ko gati yaa ghumaav dene athwa chamatkaarik dhang se samaapt karne aadi main asamarth rahati he vahaan use katharoodhi yaa maatr roodhi kaha jayega, kathanak roodhi nahin
 For example, the contract to bring pearls out of the sea to marry Indravati in the first half of Noor Muhammad, Indravati, is a "plot stereotype" because Rajkumar was forced to become a prisoner of Durjanarai by fulfilling the same and both Budasen and Indravati tried to please After destroying Durjanarai by a king named Rajkumar was freed from captivity
 katha kaa vistaar bhi hua or use ek nayaa mode bhi mila
 But due to no such condition in Rasratan, Rambha in Swayamvar directly selects Sursen
 katha ko isse na koi gati milti he or na hi kisi prakaar kaa ghumaav athwa vistaar
 Hence, the swayamvar or marriage is a kathadhri or stereotype that has been organized only to keep the chronological description of the story in order
 kathanak roodhi yaa kathanak abhipraay kaa sambandh vishuddh rup se katha ke vasteshilp yaa dhaanche se rahata he
 But poetic motifs relate to a completely different narrative or expression side of poetry
 saadrishy ke aadhaar par nirmit roodhiyon kaa sambandh bhi abhivyakti paksh se hi he parantu inkaa kaary saadrishy ke aadhaar par arthbodh yaa bhavabodh karana maatr he
 Descriptive or rule-related stereotypes like city, park, ashram, Nakhshikh, Rituvarnan, Barhamasa, etc
 also belong to the externalization of fiction or poetry
 lekin ye kavinium maatr hai yaa inhen varnanaroodhi bhi kah sakate hai or inase us sadhe hue sanketon ko prastut nahin kiya ja saktaa jo kavy abhipraayon yaa kathanak roodhiyon ke madhyam se thode main bahut kuch dyotit karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
