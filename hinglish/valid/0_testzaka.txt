 In Britain it is estimated that more than 30% of smoke alarms may have dead batteries or batteries fired
 parinamswaroop, smoke detector badariyon ko niyamit rup se badalane ke sambandh main logon ko yaad dilaane hetu saarvajanik soochna abhiyaan taiyaar kiya gaya he
 For example, in Australia it is advertised that all smoke warning batteries should be replaced on the first day of April each year
 In regions where time is used to save time by forwarding the clock, these campaigns can suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clock or on their birthday
 kuch detectaron ko lithium bydaree ke saath bhi bechaa ja rahaa he jo 7 se 10 varshon tak chal sakate hai, haalanki yah vastav main logon ke dwaara badariyon ko badalanaa kam hi sambhav kar saktaa he, kyonki unhen badalane ki kabhi-kabhi jarurat hoti he
 By that time, the entire detector may need to be replaced
 haalanki apekshaakrit mahange, upyogkarta dwaara badale jane yogya 9 volt vaali lithium batariyaan bhi uplabdh hai
 Common nimh and nicd rechargable batteries have a high automatic discharge rate that makes them unsuitable for use in smoke detectors
 yah satya hota he yadhyapi charge karne ke thik baad, jaise ki portable sterio main istemaal kiye jane par ve kshareey badariyon kii tulana main bahut adhik shakti pradaan kar sakate hai
 Also, one problem with recharging batteries is the rapid decrease in voltage at the end of their useful charge
 yah un upkarnon jaise ki smoke detectaron main chintaa kaa vishay he, kyonki bydaree itani teji se "aaweshit" se "mrit" ho saktaa he ki detector se kam-bydaree sambandhi chetavanee avadhi yaa to itani choti hoti he ki un par dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he yaa ve bilkul hi utpann nahin hoti hai
 The NFPA recommends that homeowners replace smoke detector batteries at least once per year with a new battery when it starts chirping or when it fails to check, which the NFPA alarms each month
 But it is recommended to press the "check" button at least once a month
 2004 main, enaiasti ne ek vyapak report jari kiya jiskaa yah nishkarsh he ki anya vastuon main jisamen ki "ynikaran prakaar yaa vidyutprakashiya prakaar vaale smoke alarmon ne nivaasiyon ko gharon main lage adhikansh aag se batch nikalne ke liye lagaataar samay diya" or "pehle ke nishkarshon ke anuroop, ynikaran prakaar vaale alarmon ne dadhakati aag kii sthiti main vidyutprakashiya alarmon kii tulana main behatar pratikraya pradaan kiya or vidyutprakashiya alarmon ne sulagane vaali aag kii sthiti main ynikaran prakaar vaale alarmon kii apeksha kaaphi tej pratikraya kii
 The NFPA strongly recommends replacing alarms used in homes every 10 years
 smoke alarm samay ke saath kam vishwasaneey ho jate hai, mukhya rup se apane electronic upkarnon ke puraane hone ke kaaran, jo unhen pareshaani paidaa karne vaale jhuthe alarmon kaa shikaar banane yogya bana dete hai
 In ionization type alarms, the decay of the 241am radioactive source is a negligible factor, as its half-life is much longer than the expected useful life of the alarm unit
 niyamit rup se safai, dhul yaa mackhiyon jaisi anya vastuon dwaara shuru kiye gaye jhuthe alarmon ko roak saktaa he, vishesh rup se optical prakaar vaale alarmon main kyonki unamem in karkon se prabhavit hone kii adhik sambhaavna hoti he
 a vacuum cleaner can be used to clean ionization and optical detectors from outside and inside
 haalanki, vyavsaayik ynikaran detectaron main ek avisheshgy vyakti ko isaki bhitari safai karne kii salaah nahin di jaati he
 Use an optical or "toast proof" alarm near the kitchen to reduce false alarms generated by kitchen smoke
 neuyork ke uttari jile ke liye sanyukt rajya america jila nyaayalay ke ek juri ne 2006 main yah nirnay kiya ki first alert evam isaki mul company, bi aar ke brands, lakhon dollar ke harjane ke liye uttaradaayi thi kyonki hamert ke ghar ke smoke alarm main ynikaran takanic doshapurn tha, jo dhire-dhire jalane vaali aag evam parivaar ke soye rahane ke samay ghar main bharne vaale dam ghontne vaale dhuen kaa pataa lagane main asafal rahaa
 In the United States, most native and local laws regarding the required number of smoke detectors and their determination are based on the standards established in Article 72 of the NFPA Fire Code
 smoke detectaron ke instolation ko niyantrit karne vaale kaanoon sthaan ke aadhaar par alag-alag ho sakate hai
 Owners of homes with questions and concerns regarding the determination of a smoke detector can contact their local fire marshal or building inspector for assistance
 haalanki, maujuuda gharon ke liye kuch niyam or disha nirdesh sampurna viksit duniya main apekshaakrit ek samaan rahe hai
 For example, in Canada and Australia it is necessary to have a working smoke detector at each level of the buildings
 a smoke detector is required in every habitable level in the United States and around all sleeping rooms
 rahane yogya staron main ve ataariyaan bhi shaamil hai jinase hokar aasaani se pravesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Minimum requirements are usually more stringent in new construction
 sabhi smoke detectaron ko sidhe bijli ke taron se atkana chahie, aapas main judaa hua hona chahie evam unamem ek bydaree byaap hona chahie
 iske alaava, sthaneey niyamon ke aadhaar par prayek sone ke kamare ke bheetar yaa baahar smoke detectaron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Smoke detectors installed outside can detect the fire more quickly, assuming that the fire will not start from the sleeping room but the sound of the alarm will decrease and it will not wake up some people
 In some areas, smoke detectors are also required in stairways, main corridors and garages
 taar lagi hui ikaiyaan jinke saath ek teesraa "paraspar sanyojit" taar hota he vah ek darjan yaa usase adhik detectaron ko judane detaa he jisase ki yadi kisi ko dhuen kaa pataa chalane par alarm network ke sabhi detectaron main bajane lagegaa, jo is sambhaavna ko badha degaa ki nivaasiyon ko saavdhaan kiya ja sakegaa, bhale hi ve band daravaaje ke bheetar hon yaa alarm unke sthaan se ek yaa do manzil kii duuri par chaalu kiya jaae
 taar lage hue paraspar sangyojan keval nae nirmaan main hi upyog karne main vyaavhaarik ho sakate hai, vishesh rup se yadi taar ko un kshetron main le jane kii jarurat ho jahaan deevaaron yaa chhaton main chhed kiye bina nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 By the mid-2000s, development had begun in the field of wirelessly networked smoke alarms using technologies such as zigbee to easily reestablish a building without connecting expensive wires to interconnected alarms
 Will grant permission
 Many wireless systems using wi-safe technology will also be able to detect smoke or carbon monoxide through detectors, which together alarm themselves through vibrating pads, strobe and remotely used warning handsets
 Will start giving Since these systems are wireless, they can be easily transferred from one location to another
 britain main detectaron ke nirdhaaran samaan hai haalanki nae nirmaanon main smoke alarmon ko british maanak bs5839pt6 kaa paalan karnaa padataa he
 BS 5839: Pt
6: 2004 recommends that a newly constructed property having more than 3 floors should have a grade d LD2 system
 Building regulations in England, Wales and Scotland suggest that BS 5839: Pt
6 should be followed, but at least one grade D, LD3 system should be in place
 Building regulations in Northern Ireland require a Grade d LD2 system to be installed, with smoke alarms in the walkway and meeting rooms and a heat warning alarm in the kitchen
 is maanak ke anusaar yah bhi aavashyak he ki sabhi detectaron main ek mukhya bijli aapurti evam ek bydaree byaap avashya rahe

 Radio-frequency detection is the use of an object that is applied or inserted into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identifying and tracking radio waves
 kuch tag ko kai meter dur se or pathak kii drushti rekha ke paar se padhaa ja saktaa he
 Most RFID tags have at least two parts
 pehla, ekikrut paripath he jo soochna kaa bhandaaran or use sansaadhit karne, radio aavriti sanket ko modulate or demodulate karne or anya vishesh kaary karne ke liye zimmedaar he
 The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting signals
 aam taur par teen prakaar ke RFID tag hote hai: sakriy RFID tag, jisamen ek bydaree hoti he or ye sanketon ko swatantra rup se sanchaarit kar sakate hai, niskriy RFID tag, jisamen bydaree nahin hoti or sanket sancharan prerit karne ke liye ek bahari strot kii jarurat hoti he or bydaree samarthit niskriy jise jaagane ke liye bahari strot kii aavashyaktaa he lekin isamen mahatvapurn ucch forward link kshamta he jo atyadhik pathan seemaa pradaan karata he
 RFID has many applications, for example, it is used in enterprise supply chain management to improve inventory tracking and improve management efficiency
 1945 main leone theramin ne soviet sangh ke liye ek jasusi upkaran kaa avishkaar kiya jo shravy jaankaree ke saath ghatana radio tarangon ko punah sanchaarit karata tha
 The sound waves vibrated a diaphragm that slightly changed the shape of the resonator, modulating the reflected radio frequency
 yadhyapi yah upkaran ek gupt shravy upkaran tha, naa ki ek pahchaan tag, ise RFID praudyogiki kaa ek purvavarti mana jaataa he, kyonki yah bhi vaise hi niskriy tha, jo ek bahya strot se vidyutchumbakeey tarangon dwaara shaktishaalee or sakriy ho jaataa tha
 Similar technology, such as the IFF transponder invented in 1915 in the United Kingdom, was regularly used by the Allies in World War II to identify aircraft as friends or foes
 abhi bhi transponder kaa, atyadhik shaktishaalee vimaan dwaara aaj bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Another work examining RFID is the important 1948 Harry Stockman paper entitled "communication by Means of Reflected Power"
 stockman ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki "


 Considerable research and development work has to be done before resolving the remaining basic problems in reflexed-power communication and locating the field of useful applications
 " The mold of Mario Kardullo: US Patent was the first true ancestor of modern RFID in 1973; a passive radio transponder with memory
 praarambhik upkaran niskriy tha, jo poochtacha sanket ke dwaara sanchalit hota tha or 1971 main neuyork port athurity or anya sambhavit prayoktaaon ke liye iskaa pradarshan kiya gaya or yah ek toll upkaran ke rup main istemaal ke liye 16 bit smriti ke saath ek transponder se bana tha
 The basic Kardullo patent covers the use of RF, sound and light as transmission media
 1969 main, niveshkon ke saamne prastut mul vyapaar yojana ne parivahan, banking, suraksha or chikitsa main iskaa istemaal dikhaaya
 a very early demonstration of the Reflected Power RFID tag, both passive and semi-passive, was performed by Steven Depp, Alfred Koelle, and Robert Framan at the 1973 Los Alamos National Laboratory
 yah portable pranali 915 megahertz par sanchalit hoti thi or 12-bit tag kaa prayog karti thi
 This technique is used by most UHFID and microwave RFID tags today

 In October 2007, wal-mart announced a new core area for RFID implementation
 wal-mart kaa ek or prabhag, sams club bhi is disha main aage aayaa he
 On January 7, 2008, it sent a letter to its suppliers stating that from January 31, 2008, each complete single-item palette could be sent to its distribution centers in Desoto, Texas, or directly to one of its stores serviced by that DC However, it is necessary to have an EPC Gen 2 RFID tag on it
 iskaa paalan karne main naakaam rahane vaale aapurtikarta ko seva shulk dena hoga
 However, in January 2009, Sam's Club significantly reduced non-compliance fines, which it reduced from $ 2 per palette to just 12 cents per palette
 wal-mart kaa anumaan he ki sams ke liye khud tanging karne par prati pallate 12 saint kaa kharchaa aayega
 Symes also announced that palette-level tagging is expected to be rolled out throughout the series in 2010, while the timeframe for tagging on individual items is "under consideration"

 However, retailers typically engage in forward buying and tend to buy more products during the discount period than they intended to sell during the promotional period
 kuch khudara vikreta ek prakaar ke antarpanan main sanlagn ho jate hai or riyayati utpaada ko anya khudara vikritaon ko bechney lag jate hai, is abhyaas ko diverting ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 To counter this practice, manufacturers are exploring the possibility of using RFID tags on promoted merchandise to track exactly which products have been sold through the supply chain at completely discounted prices
 RFID praudyogiki ke kai upyogon main se ek he unka pustakaalayon main prayog
 This technology has gradually started replacing traditional barcodes on library items
 RFID tag main pahchaan sambandhit jaankaree ho sakati he jaise ek pustak kaa sheershak yaa saamagree prakaar, jiske tahat ek alag databes kii ore ishaara karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin hogi 
 This information is read by an RFID reader, which replaces the standard barcode reader commonly found on the circulation table of a library
 pustkaalay saamagree par paaya jane vaala RFID tag aamtaur par uttar america main 50 mm x 50 mm or europe main 50 mm x 75 mm ke naap kaa hota he
 It can be replaced or incorporated into barcodes, which will provide staff with a different method of inventory management and service to the takers themselves
 yah ek suraksha upkaran ke rup main bhi kaary kar sakate hai or paramparaagat vidyut chumbakeey pattee kii jagah le sakate hai or na keval kitaaben, balki sadsyta card main bhi ek RFID tag lagaaya ja saktaa he
 However, there is debate as to when and where rfids first started in libraries, it was first proposed in the 1990s as a technology to increase workflow in library settings
 pustakaalayon main sarvapratham RFID shuru karne waalon main nishchit rup se singapore he or neuyork main rockfilor vishvavidhyalay is takanic kaa upyog karne vaala sanyukt rajya america main pehla shaikshanik pustkaalay he, jabaki michigan main Farmington Community Library is takanic kaa upyog karne vaali pehali saarvajanik sanstha he, donon ne 1999 main RFID kaa upyog shuru kiya
 In Europe, the first public library to use RFID is in hogejund-sapheimer in the Netherlands, where in 2001 an option was given to collectors
 unhen aashcharyachakit karte hue, bujurg logon sahit 70% ne RFID vikalp kaa prayog kiya or jaldi hi anukulit ho gaye
 In absolute numbers worldwide, RFID is the most used in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom and Japan
 anumaan he ki duniya bhar main 30 million se adhik pustkaalay samagriyon par ab RFID tag laga he jisamen rome main vatican librari main kuch shaamil hai
 RFID has many library applications that can be highly beneficial, especially to circulation employees
 chunki RFID tag ko kisi vastu ke andar se bhi padhaa ja saktaa he, kisi saamagree ko scan karne ke liye kisi kitaab ke aavaran yaa DVD ke khol ko kholane kii jarurat nahin he
 This can reduce repetitive motion injuries
 jahaan pustakon ke upar ek barcode he, vahaan abhi bhi yah suvidha he ki lenevaale ek kitaab ko ek baar main karne kii bajaae, pustakon ke ek puure dher ko ek baar main scan kar sakate hai
 Since RFID tags can also be read in motion, using an RFID reader to check the returned material on the conveyor belt saves employee time
 lekin, jaisaa ki barcode ke saath he, yah sabhi lenevaalon ke dwaara swayan hi kiya ja saktaa he jiskaa arth hua ki unhen phir kabhi karmchaariyon kii sahaayta kii jarurat naa ho
 In addition to these fixed location readers, there are portable readers
 in sab ke saath, vastusuchee ko kuch second ke bheetar, saamagree ke ek puure shelf par kiya ja sakegaa, jiske tahat ek bhi pustak ko aalmaari se hataanaa nahin padegaa

 In Umeå, Sweden, RFID is used to obtain audio books for the blind
 malaysia main, multimedia uniwarsity librari, sibarajaya main pustakon kaa sateek sthaan ingit karne ke liye smart shelvs kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 In the Netherlands, hand held readers have been started for this purpose
 saarvajanik pustkaalay kaa dach sangh ek anyonyakriya 'sandarbh pustkaalay' kii avadharana par kaam kar rahaa he, jahaan lenevaalon ko ek reader / headphone set miltaa he, jo unhen pustkaalay ke vaanchit anubhag kii ore le jaataa he or jiskaa istamaal ve almariyon par rakhi pustakon se vaanchit str ke vivaran ke saath soochna padhane ke liye kar sakate hai jo pustak ke tag se hi aata he yaa kahin or sthit database se or lenevaale kii variyataon ke aadhaar par vikalp kaa suzav praapt karke, is prakaar pustkaalay kaa or adhik vyaktigat sanskaran banaaya ja saktaa he
 With this they will also go to those parts of the library where otherwise they do not travel
 lenevaale, is pranali kaa upyog anubhavon ke aadan-pradaan ke liye bhi kar sakate hai 
 It is already being done by children in the virtual realm in mijnstempel
nl, but it can also be done in physical form
 lenevaale, vaapasi mez par kitaab ko grad de sakate hai
 But, as of 2008, this technique is very expensive for many small libraries and the conversion period for an average-sized library is estimated at 11 months
 2004 kaa ek dach anumaan tha ki ek pustkaalay jo prati varsh 100,000 kitaaben padaan karata he use €50,000 kii laagat par yojana banani chahie 
 Reducing a large burden on staff by RFID means that fewer staff are needed, resulting in the removal of some of them, but this has not yet happened in North America where recent surveys have not found a single library Where the employee has been removed due to RFID
 balki, karmiyon ke liye pustkaalay bajet kam kiya ja rahaa he or buniyadi suvidhaon ke liye badhaayaa ja rahaa he, jisase pustakaalayon ke liye yah aavashyak ho gaya he ki ve karmchaariyon kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye swachaalan ko badhayen
 Furthermore, the functions performed by RFID are largely not the primary function of the librarian
 netherland main ek khoj yah he ki, lenevaale is tathy se khush hai ki ab sawaalon ke jawaab dene ke liye or adhik karmchaaree uplabdh hai
 The concern regarding RFID in libraries is the issue of privacy
 chunki RFID transmeter or reader ke anusaar, RFID tag ko 350 feet yaa 100 meter se padhaa or scan kiya ja saktaa he or chunki RFID, frequency ke vargeekaran kaa istemaal karata he, chintaa kaa vishay yah he ki kya samvedansheel jaankaree ko ek anicchhuk strot se ekatra kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the library's RFID tag does not include any patron information, and the frequency the tag uses in most libraries is only readable by about ten feet
 saath hi, pustakaalayon ko hameshaa yah record rakhana he ki kisne kab kya liya he, to us myne main koi nai baat nahin he
 However, many libraries destroy these records once the material is returned
 RFID, pathakon kii gopneeyata ke is sammaan ko jatil yaa samaapt kar degi
 In addition, another non-library agency may record the RFID tag of each person leaving the library, possibly without the knowledge or consent of the library administrator
 ek aasaan vikalp he ki pustak ko ek code sanchaarit karne diya jaae jiskaa mahatv sirf librari ke databes ke saath sangyojan ke rup main ho
 Another step is to give the book a new code whenever it is returned
 or agar bhavishya main reader sarvavyaapak ho jaae to, chori gai kitabon ko librari ke baahar bhi pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The removal of the tag can be made difficult if the tag is small enough to be invisibly placed inside a page, possibly put there by the publisher
 90 ke dashak ke aarambhik varshon main vibhinn jaanwaron kii pahchaan ke prayog main safalataa ne vibhinn maanav trekking vikalpon main RFID anusandhan ko prerit kiya he
 The first RFID passports were issued by Malaysia in 1998

 ICAO maanak, i-passport ko pahchaanane ke liye saamne ke aavaran par ek maanak i-passport logo uplabdh karaate hai
 In 2006 the RFID tag was included in the new US passport
 america ne 2005 main 10 million passport kaa utpaadan kiya or anumaan he ki 2006 main 13 million kaa utpaadan kiya jayega
 The inlay work of chips manufactured by Smartrack will preserve the same information as printed in the passport and will also include a digital photograph of the owner
 america videsh vibhaag ne shuru main kaha ki chips ko keval 10 semi kii duuri se padhaa ja sakegaa, lekin vyapak aalochana or spasht pradarshan ke baad yah vishesh upkaran pareekshan passport ko 10 meter kii duuri se pard saktaa he, in passport kii dizine main dhaatu kaa ek astr he jo anaadhikrut pathakon ke liye isamen se jaankaree "khinchne" ko adhik kathin banaata he jab passport band ho
 The department will also implement basic access control which will act as a personal identification number in the form of letters printed on the passport data page
 ek passport tag ko padhe jane se pehle, is pin ko ek RFID reader main darj karnaa hoga
 The BAC enables encryption of any communication between the chip and the interrogator
 suraksha visheshgy bruce shnair ne suzav diya he ki ek hawaii adde ke nikat sanchaalan karata ek luteraa amir deshon se aane waalon ko shikaar bana saktaa he, yaa ek aatankwaadi ek taatkaalik visphotak upkaran dizin kar saktaa he jo tab kaary karegaa jab kisi vishesh desh ke vyakti dwaara sampark kiya jaae yadi yatri apana card apane sharir ke najadik yaa ek foile-lind batue main nahin rakhte

 july, 2004 main, america ke khaadya evam aushadhi prashasan ne ek aadesh jari kiya jo aavashyak rup se ek antim samiksha kii prakriya shuru karata he jo tay karegaa ki kya aspataalon main rogiyon kii pahchaan karne or / yaa sambandhit aspataal ke staff ko medical record kaa upyog karne kii anumati dene ke liye RFID pranali kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Since then, many RF hospitals have implanted an RFID tag in patients in the US and have typically begun using the RFID system for workflow and inventory management
 kuch aise saboot bhi hai ki aspataalon main RFID pranali ke karyanvayan ke parinamswaroop nurse or aspataal ke anya karmchaariyon kii gatividhiyon par adhik nigaraanee rakhi ja sakati he
 IVF clinics are considering the use of RFID to prevent mingling between sperm and eggs
 oktober 2004 main, FDA ne maanav main pratyaropit kiye ja sakane vaale america ke pehle RFID chip ko manjuuri di
 verichip Corporation's 134 khz RFID chips can hold personal medical information and, according to the company, can be lifesaving in the case of errors in medical treatment and limiting injuries
 FDA anumodan ko niveshkon ke saath ek sammelan ke dauraan bataaya gaya
 Shortly after approval, authors and anti-rfid activists Catherine Albrecht and Liz mcintire discovered a warning letter from the FDA that wrote about serious health risks associated with the verichip
 FDA ke mutabik, inamen shaamil hai "pratikul utak pratikriya", "pratyaropit transponder kaa sthaan parivartan", "pratyaropit transponder kii vifaltaa","bijli ke khatre" or "magnetic rejonence imaging asangati
" St
 Clair Hospital in Pittsburgh has implemented an RFID and barcode-based bedside drug verification system that improves patient safety by reducing medication errors

 To combat domestic health fraud, Medicare & Medicaid Services recently announced an investigation into the domestic health care industry
 march 2009 main, neuyork main ek tikaoo chikitsa upkaran aapurtikarta, elite medical supplai, chikitsa dhokhadhadi se ladane ke liye hastakshar karne waalon main pratham tha
 They chose cybra's edgemagic RFID and bar code software to take this process forward
 koi vaishvik saarvajanik sanstha nahin he jo RFID ke liye prayukt frequency ko niyantrit karti he
 In principle, every country can set its own rules for this
 RFID ke liye frequency aavanton ko niyantrit karne vaale mukhya nikaay hai: Low-frequency tags and high-frequency tags can be used globally without a license
 ultra hai-frequency tag ko duniya bhar main istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa he kyonki koi bhi vaishvik maanak nahin he
 In North America, UHF can be used unlicensed for 902-928 & mhz, but there are restrictions on transmission rights
 europe main, RFID or anya kam-kshamta vidyut radio anuprayog, ETSI kii siforeeshon EN 300 220 or EN 302 208 or ERO 70 03 sifarish dwaara viniyamit hai, jo RFID ko 865-868 megahertj ke kuch jatil band pratibandhon ke saath sanchaalan kii anumati dete hai
 Readers need to monitor a channel before broadcasting; This requirement imposes little restriction on performance, the resolution of which is the subject of existing research
 uttar america UHF maanak, france main sweekaar nahin kiye jate hai chunki ye uske sainya band ke saath hastkshep karte hai
 For China and Japan, there are no rules for using UHF
 in deshon main har UHF ke aavedan ke liye ek site license kii zarurat he, jiskaa aavedan sthaneey adhikariyon ke paas kiya janaa chahie or ise radd kiya ja saktaa he
 918–926 mhz are unlicensed for Australia and New Zealand, but restrictions exist for transmission rights
 ye frequencys ISM band ke rup main jaani jaati hai 
 The return signal of the tag may also interfere with other radio users
 RFID praudyogiki ke sambandh main banaae gaye kuch maanakon main shaamil hai: EPC Gen2 is short for epcglobal UHF Class 1 Generation 2
 epcglobal, duniya bhar main companiyon ke liye aapurti shrinkhalaa main kai madon kii pahchaan main zyaadaatar niskriy RFID or EPC ke upyog ke liye antarrashtriya maanak par kaam kar rahi he
 One of epcglobal's campaigns was to simplify the rift of protocols prevalent in the RFID world in the 1990s
 do tag air interphes ko epcglobal dwaara 2003 se pehle paribhaashit kiya gaya
 These protocols, commonly known as Class 0 and Class 1, underwent significant commercial implementation in 2002–2005
 2004 main hardware ection group ne ek nae protocol, class 1 janareshan 2 interphes nirmit kiya jisane kai samasyaon ko suljhaayaa jiskaa anubhav class 0 tathaa class 1 ke saath kiya gaya tha
 The EPC Gen2 standard was approved in December 2004 and is expected to form the basis of the moving passive RFID tag standards
 ise Intermec se ek vivaad ke baad ki is maanak se unke rfid-sambandhit kai patent kaa ulanghan ho saktaa he, manjuuri di gai
 It was decided that not just the standard is infringing on their patent, but that Intermec may have to pay some royalties if the tag is to be read in a particular way
 EPC Gen2 maanak ko ISO 18000-6C ke rup main maamuli sanshodhano ke saath 2006 main apanaaya gaya
 The lowest cost of Gen2 EPC inlays by smartcode is $ 0
05 for each piece in the segment of 100 million or more
 phir bhi, aagaamee roopantaran or upyogi RFID label main inlez se or maujuuda Gen 2 protocol maanak kaa dizin, kul antim laagat main badhotaree karegaa, vishesh rup se RFID aapurti shrinkhalaa vastu-stareey tanging ke liye atirikt suraksha upayon ke vistaar ke saath
 Here is the full list of updates on UHF Gen2 regulation worldwide
 suchi ko janvari 2009 main adhyatan kiya gaya he
 highfid is at the point of commercial viability
 sanyukt rajya america main RFID ke liye istemaal frequenciyaan europe yaa japan kii frequensiyon ke saath vartmaan main asangat he
 Furthermore, no emerging standard has yet become as widespread as barcodes
 RFID suraksha ko lekar ek praathmik chintaa RFID tag kii avaidh trekking he
 Tags, which are globally readable, pose a threat to both private space privacy and corporate / military security
 is tarah kii chintaaen, america raksha vibhaag dwaara haal main aapurti shrinkhalaa prabandhan ke liye RFID tag ko apnaane se uthaai gai hai
 Generally, privacy organizations have expressed concern in the context of ongoing efforts to incorporate electronic product code RFID tags into consumer products
 dizin ke aadhaar par, epcglobal Network bhi Dos hamalon ke prati kamazor he
 In using a similar system with DNS to resolve EPC data requests, ONS root servers become vulnerable to dos attacks
 epcglobal Network ke saath shuruyaat karne kii yojana bana rahaa koi bhi sanghathan yah gyaat hone par thithur jayega ki epcglobal Network ke buniyadi dhaanche main DNS ke samaan hi suraksha kamajoriyaan hai
 a second class of defense uses cryptography to prevent tag cloning
 kuch tag ek prakaar ke "rolling code" yojana kaa upyog karte hai, jisamen tag pahachanakarta jaankaree prayek scan ke baad parivartit ho jaati he, is tarah dekhi gai pratikriyaaon kii upyogita ko kam kar detii he
 More sophisticated tools engage in challenge-response authentication where the tag interacts with the reader
 in protocol main, tag or reader ke bich asurakshit sanchaar channel par gupt tag jaankaree nahin bheji jaati he
 Rather, the reader issues a challenge to the tag, which answers with a result that is calculated using cryptographic circuits tied to some latent value
 aise protocol, samamit yaa saarvajanik kunjee kryptography par aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 a code-enabled tag is usually dramatically higher in price and requires more power than the simpler counterpart and as a result the deployment of these tags is more limited
 is laagat / vidyut bandhan ne kuch nirmaataaon ko kaaphi kamjor yaa swaamitv vaali ancripshan yojanaon kaa upyog karke kutlekhith tag lagane main prerit kiya, jo parishkrut hamale ko aavashyak rup se nahin rokte
 exxon-mobil Speedpass, for example, uses a cryptographic-enabled tag created by Texas Instruments, called Digital Signature Transponder, which includes a weak, proprietary encryption scheme to perform a challenge-response protocol for low cost is
 phir bhi anya kutlekhith protocol, anadhikrut pathakon ke khilaaf gopneeyata hasil karne ke prayaas main hai, haalanki ye protocol abhi anusandhan charan main hai
 a major challenge in securing RFID tags is the lack of computational resources within the tag
 maanak kutalekhan takanic main adhikansh kam keemat vaale RFID upkarnon main uplabdh sansadhano kii tulana main adhik kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 RSA Security has patented a prototype device that locally blocks RFID signals by interfering with a standard collision avoidance protocol, and allows the user to stop detection if desired
 vibhinn nitigat upayon kaa bhi prastaav kiya gaya he, jaise ki RFID tag vaali vastu ko ek udyog maanak label ke saath chihnit karnaa

 is kshetra main sandarbh kii ek vyapak suchi RFID Security and Privacy Lounge main pai ja sakati he
 Ars Technica reported an RFID buffer overflow bug in March 2006 that could infect the airport terminal RFID database for baggage and also the passport database to obtain passport holder's confidential information
 passport ko adhik surakshit banane ke prayaas main kai deshon ne passport main RFID lagu kiya he
 However, encryption on UK chips was broken within 48 hours
 us ghatana ke baad se or adhik prayaas ne shodhakartaaon ko, jab passport ko uske maalik ke paas bheja ja rahaa ho us vakt passport data ko clon karne kii anumati di
 Where an offender was required to secretly open and close the envelope, it can now be done without being detected, leading to some insecurity in the passport system
 bazaar main aise kai utpaada uplabdh hai jo RFID sakasham card yaa passport ke sambandhit vaahak ko apane data ke parirakshan kii anumati denge
 Rather now, the United States government has made it necessary for its new employee ID card to be shipped with an approved shielding sleeve or envelope
 is baat ko lekar virodhabhasi vichaar vyaapt hai ki kya aluminium RFID chip ke padhane ko roak saktaa he
 Some claim that aluminum shielding, which originally built a Faraday cage, works perfectly
 dusron kaa daawa he ki aluminium panni main ek RFID card ko sirf lapetane se keval prasaaran main or adhik baadha aati he, isliye puri tarah se ise rokane main kargar nahin he
 Shielding is then a function of the frequency being used
 lo frequesnci lowfid tag, jaise jo manushya or paaltu jaanwaron ke liye pratyaropan yogya upkarnon main istemaal hote hai, parirakshan ke prati apekshaakrit pratirodhi hai, haalanki mote dhaatu kii panni adhikansh pathan ko rokegi
 High frequency highfid tags are sensitive to shielding and are difficult to read when they are within a few centimeters of a metal surface
 UHF ultra-highfid tag ko padhanaa kathin he jab unhen kisi dhaatu kii sataha ke kuch millimetre ke bheetar rakhaa jaae, haalanki unki pathan seemaa vastav main bad jaati he jab unhen kisi dhaatu se 2–4 cm par rakhaa jaataa he or iskaa kaaran he tag par pratibimbit tarang or insident tarang kaa sakaaratmak sudrudheekaran
 UHFID tags can be successfully shielded from most reads by placing them inside an anti-static plastic bag
 RFID praudyogiki ke upyog ne kaaphi vivaad ko janm diya or yahaan tak ki upabhokta gopneeyata pairokaron dwaara utpaada bahishkaar bhi hua
 CASPIAN co-founders Catherine Albrecht and Liz mcintire are two of the most critical critics of the technology, referring to RFID tags as "spychips"
 RFID sambandhit do mukhya gopneeyata chintaaen hai: Most concerns revolve around the fact that RFID tags sticking to products remain active even after the product is purchased and taken home and thus can be used for purposes unrelated to monitoring and supply chain inventory operations
 uparokt dwaara uthaai gai chintaaon ko clip tag ke prayog dwaara aanshik rup se khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 The clipped tag is an RFID tag designed to increase consumer privacy
 clip tag kaa suzav IBM shodhakartaaon, paul moscovitz or guentar karjoth dwaara diya gaya he
 After the sale, the consumer can uproot a portion of the tag
 isse ek lambii duuri ke tag ko ek najdiki tag main parivartan kii anumati milti he jise ab bhi padhaa ja saktaa he, lekin sirf kam duuri par - kuch inch yaa centimetre se bhi kam main
 This modification of the tag can be confirmed by eye
 is tag kaa upyog baad main vaapasi, yaad dilaane, yaa ricycling ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The reading range, however, is a function of both the reader and the tag
 praudyogiki ke kshetra main sudhaar se tag kii pathan seemaa main vruddhi kii ja sakati he
 Being too close to the reader's tag makes short-range tags readable
 aam taur par, ek tag kii pathan seemaa ko reader se utani duuri par simit kiya jaataa he jis par tag, reader kshetra se tag ko niyantrit karne ke liye paryaapt urja khinch sake
 By increasing the power of a reader, tags can be read from a distance greater than the distance assigned to them
 pathan duuri par seemaa, tab reader ko tag se waapas bheje gaye sanket kaa signal-tu-nauez anupaat ban jaataa he
 Researchers at two security conferences showed that passive ultra-highfid tags, not the type of highfid used in US passports that are typically read up to 30 feet, can be read from 50–69 feet using appropriate equipment
 janvari 2004 main, CASPIAN ke gopneeyata ke pairokaar or german gopneeyata samooh foebud ko germany main METRO future store main aamantrit kiya gaya, jahaan ek RFID payalat pariyojna lagu kii gai thi
 Incidentally it was revealed that the METRO "payback" Customer Loyalty Card contained RFID tags with a customer ID, a fact neither disclosed to the card-receiving customers nor to the group advocating privacy
 yah METRO dwaara is aashwaasan ke baavjood hua ki kisi graahak pahchaan data ko trek nahin kiya ja rahaa he or sabhi RFID upyog ko spasht rup se bataaya gaya he
 Between 16 and 18 November 2005, during the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society, the founder of the Free Software Movement, Richard Stollman, opposed the use of RFID security cards
 pehali baithak ke dauraan yah sahmati hui ki bhavishya kii baithkon main RFID card kaa upyog nahin kiya jayega or yah jaankaar ki is aashwaasan ko todaa gaya he, unhone apane card ko aluminium panni main lapet liya or ve ise keval suraksha steshnon par hi kholenge
 The protest caused considerable concern from security personnel, where some prevented them from going out of the conference room in which they were the keynote speakers and were not allowed to enter the other conference rooms where they were yet to speak

 RFID was one of the main topics of the 2006 Chaos Communication Congress and triggered a large press debate
 vishay shaamil the: electronic passport, mifare kryptography or fifa vishwa cap 2006 ke liye tikat
 The talks demonstrated how the first widespread use of real-world RFID technology worked in the 2006 FIFA World Cup of football

 The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of RFID chip in humans

 isse ek vyakti kii gopneeyata sambandhit chintaaen bad gai hai chunki ve jahaan bhi ve jaayenge unhen unke ek adwitiya pahachanakarta dwaara sambhavit rup se trek kiya ja saktaa he
 There are concerns that this could be abused by a totalitarian government or could result in the removal of independence
 22 july 2006 ko, riters ne suchit kiya ki do haikaron, navitz or westehus ne neuyork shahar main ek sammelan main darshaya ki ve ek maanav pratyaropit RFID chip se RFID sanket kaa clon bana sakate hai or sabit kiya ki yah chip hack-rodhi nahin he, jaisaa ki pehle daawa kiya gaya tha
 Surgery, even on a small scale, brings with it its risks
 RFID chip pratyaropan bhi koi apwaad nahin he
 According to David B
 Smith, author of "using Radio Frequency Identification Technology in Humans in the United States for Total Control," Smith gives examples of health risks such as "


 pratikul utak pratikriya, pratyaropit transponder kaa pravaas, samjhauta soochna suraksha, pratyaropit transponder kii vifaltaa, pratyaropan kii vifaltaa, electronic scinar kii vifaltaa, vidyut chumbakeey hastkshep bijli ke khatre, chumbakeey anunaad imaging asangati or nidel stick"
 Such risks can happen to anyone
 praudyogiki ke udai ke saath, kuch vyaktiyon ko RFID maanav pratyaropan ke kaaran adhikaron kii haani kaa dar he
 verichip is working on an RFID implant that will have GPS tracking capability
 america sarkaar dwaara yah takanic na keval ek vyakti ke liye balki astitv main maujuud har bhautik vastu kii kisi bhi or har samay bhugolic avasthati jaanane kii anumati degi
 While this technology can help detect missing children or fugitives, on the other hand it allows governments to track any object or person with an RFID chip
 iske alaava, ise saidhantik rup se kisi vyakti kii jaankaree yaa sahmati ke bina kiya ja saktaa he; or isi baat par vivaad he
 In early 2007, Chris Paget of San Francisco, California showed that RFID information could be pulled from individuals using only $ 250 worth of equipment
 isse us daawey ko samarthan miltaa he ki kabza kii gai jaankaree ke saath nakli passport bananaa apekshaakrit aasaan hoga
 According to zdnet, critics believe that this technology will monitor every activity of an individual and will be an invasion of privacy
 vivaad is baat par he ki aalochak maanate hai ki sarkaar dwaara iskaa durupyog hoga
 Some people present the concept of a future where the government will have an eye on every activity
 catherine albract ke spichips: haau major corporation and government plan tu trek yor evri move wyeth RFID, se ek vyakti ko "gaiyr-niztaa vaali duniya kii kalpana" ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 "where every purchase of yours is monitored and recorded in a database and everything of yours is numbered

 What's more, they can be detected and monitored remotely
 " sidhe shabdon main kahen, shadyantrakaariyon kaa tark he ki RFID chip ke saath sarkaar ek vyakti ko bhaan hue bina hi uski gopneeyata bhang kar sakati he

 In the scriptures, Basant Panchami is mentioned from Rishi Panchami, then it is depicted differently in Puranas and Shastras and in many poems
 sristi ke praarambhik kaal main bhagwaan vishnu kii ajna se brahma ne jeevon, khaastaur par manushya yoni kii rachana kii
 He was not satisfied with his creation
 unhen lagata tha ki kuch kami rah gai he jiske kaaran chaaron ore maun chaaya rahata he
 With permission from Vishnu, Brahma sprinkled water from his mantle, as the water on the earth shattered, it started vibrating

 Brahma requested the goddess to play the veena
 jaise hi devi ne veena kaa madhuranad kiya, sansar ke samast jeev-jantuon ko vaani praapt ho gai
 There was uproar in the water stream
 pawan chalane se sarsaraahat hone lagi
 Then Brahma called that goddess Saraswati, the goddess of speech
 saraswati ko bagishwari, bhagwati, sharada, veenavadani or vaagdevi sahit anek naamon se puja jaataa he
 They are the providers of learning and intelligence
 sangeet kii utpatti karne ke kaaran ye sangeet kii devi bhi hai
 Basant also celebrates Panchami day as his birthday

 Dandakaranya was also among the places he visited
 yaheen shabari naamak bhilni rahati thi
 When Rama came to her hut, she lost her mind and started tasting sweet berry to Ram Ji
 prem main page jhuthe beron vaali is ghatana ko ramakatha ke sabhi gayakon ne apane-apane dhang se prastut kiya
 That area of dandakaranya is spread these days in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh

 There is also a temple of Shabari Mata
 vasant panchami kaa din hamen prithviraj chouhan kii bhi yaad dilaataa he
 He defeated the foreign invader Mohammad Ghori 16 times and left him alive every time, showing generosity, but when he was defeated for the seventeenth time, Mohammad Ghori did not spare him
 vah unhen apane saath afghanistan le gaya or unki ankhen phod deen
 The event after this is well known
 mohammad gori ne mrityudand dene se purv unke shabdabhedi baan kaa kamaal dekhnaa chaha
 On the advice of Prithviraj's fellow poet Chandbardai, Ghori indicated by sitting on a high place, hitting the pan
 tabhi chandbardaai ne prithviraj ko sandesh diya
 Prithviraj Chauhan did not forget this time
 unhone tave par hui chot or chandbardaai ke sanket se anumaan lagaakar jo baan maaraa, vah mohammad gori ke seene main ja dhansa
 After this Chandrabardai and Prithviraj also surrendered by stabbing each other in the stomach
 yah ghatana bhi vasant panchami vaale din hi hui thi
 Vasant Panchami also has a deep connection with Veer reality in Lahore
 ek din jab mullah ji kisi kaam se vidhyalay chhodkar chale gayi, to sab bachche khilne lage, par vah padhata rahaa
 When the other children teased her, Durga's mother sang
 muslim baalkon ne durga maa kii hansi udayi
 Reality said that if i say something about your wife Fatima, how will you feel? bas phir kya tha, mullah ji ke aate hi un shararti chaatro ne shikaayat kar di ki isane bibi fatima ko gaali di he
 Then the matter progressed to Kazi
 muslim shashan main vahi nirnay hua, jisaki apeksha thi
 It was ordered that either reality should become Muslim, otherwise he will be given death penalty
 hakeekat ne yah sweekaar nahin kiya
 As a result, he was issued a decree to take down the sword
 kehete hai uske bhole mukh ko dekhakar jallaad ke haath se talwaar gir gayi
 Reality gave a sword in his hand and said that when i am a child and following my religion, why are you growing up and turning away from your religion? At this, the executioner strengthened his heart and fired a sword, but that hero's head did not fall to the earth
 vah akaashmaarg se sidhaa swarg chalaa gaya
 This incident took place on Vasant Panchami
 pakistan yadhyapi muslim desh he, par hakeekat ke akashagami sheesh kii yaad main vahaan vasant panchami par patangen udayi jaati he
 Reality was a resident of Lahore
 at: patangabaaji kaa sarvaadhik jor lahore main rahata he
 Vasant Panchami also reminds us of Guru Ram Singh Kuka
 unka janm 1816 i
 main vasant panchami par ludhiana ke bhaini gram main hua tha
 He stayed in Ranjit Singh's army for some time, then came home and got engaged in farming, but due to spiritual instincts, people started listening to his sermons
 dhire-dhire inke shishyon kaa ek alag panth hi ban gaya, jo kuka panth kahalaaya
 Guru Ram Singh used to place great emphasis on cow protection, Swadeshi, women salvation, inter-caste marriage, mass marriage etc
 unhone bhi sarvapratham angreji shashan kaa bahishkar kar apni swatantra dak or prashasan vyavastha chalaayi thi
 Every year a fair was held in Bhaini village on Makar Sankranti

 On the other hand, in the Bengali language "panch Kauri De", when detective literature - 'incident-umbrella', 'jai-parajaya', 'jeevan Rahasya', 'neel Vasna Sundari', 'mayavi', '- were trending in the same period
 Science fiction was also being written in it, rather it should be said that the science fiction in Bangla had preceded it
 paudhon main jivan ke vishleshak or betaar ke avishkaarak acharya jagadish chandra bose ne ‘tufaan par vijay’ sheershak se pratham bangla vigyaan galp 1897 main hi likhaa tha
 Anadidhan Bannerji presented novels like 'van Kusum', 'champa Phool', 'chor' as well as science fiction like 'mars'
 marathi main shridhar baalkrishna ranade ne pehali vigyaan katha ‘tareche hasya’ sheershak se 1915 main likhi thi

 Acharya Ramchandra Shukla has written in 'history of Hindi Literature' that Urdu speakers learned Hindi to enjoy Khatri's Tilasmi literature
 to aisa tha khatri kaa andrajalik sansar ! What is the reader, even contemporary writers could not live without being enthralled by this magic
 phir tilsmi sahitya rachane ke sarthak prayaas aarambh hue or prabhoot maatra main aisi chijen saamne aane lageen or hindi pathak usamen sarabor ho gaya
 The rich tradition of such writers is seen in this period
 devi prasad upaadhyaay krit ‘maaya-vilaas’, jagannatha chaturvedi krit ‘vasant-malti’, hare krishna johar krit ‘kusum lata’, ‘bhayanak prem’, saraswati gupta krit ‘rajkumaar’, bal mukund verma krit ‘kamini’, rajendra mohini, hare krishna johar krit ‘nari-pishaach’, ‘manyak-mohini’, ‘jaadugar’ tathaa ‘camel kumari’, madan mohan pathak krit ‘anand sundari’, munni laal khanni krit ‘sachcha bahadur’, hare krishna johar krit ‘niraala nakaabposh’ tathaa ‘bhayanak khun’, kishori laal goswami krit ‘kate mud kii do-do baaten’, vishweshwar prasad verma krit, ‘virendra kumaar’, kishori laal goswami krit ‘yakuti takhti’, ram laal verma krit ‘putalimahal’, rup kishor jain krit ‘surya kumaar sambhav’ aadi isi sahitya kii pratinidh rachanaaen hai
 This tradition continued in the future, but it is from here that tilasmi literature should often be considered as an end

 The detective novels in Hindi are Preeta Gopal Ram Gahmari
 devaki nandan khatri kii ‘chandrakanta’ or ‘narendra mohini’ ke thode samyantaral baad ‘adbhut laash’ or ‘guptchar’ ke saath gahamri bhi udit hue
 Inspired by the growing popularity of these detective novels, Gahmari created such a plethora of literature - 'baekasoor ki hanga', 'sarkati corpse', 'who is the murderer?', 'blood of innocent', 'blood of Jamuna', 'double 'spies', 'mayawini', 'sorceress Manorama' 1901), 'girl Chori', 'spy Ki Bhool', 'police Station's theft', 'robbery theft', 'blind eye', 'trap King', 'fake Kaka' , 'detective Theft,' 'theft in Warehouse', 'robbery on Robbery', 'doctor's Story', 'piercing the House', 'detective Detective ',' Devi Singh '

 lekin yaheen se yah parampara samaptpraaya he
 The reason is that this tradition was new in Hindi and completely influenced by Anglo literature
 bhartiya vaataavaran ke anuroop na hone ke kaaran pathak jaldi isse ub gaya
 The anorexia of the readers also made tilasmi, ayari and espionage literature in abeyance itself
 premchand ke avataran ke saath hi chitrapat puri tarah parivartit ho chukaa tha
 Tilasmi and espionage literature went into the background around 1917-18
 beesvin shatee ke tisare dashak main manovaigyanik or ghatana pradhan upanyaason ne dastak di
 The readership was in search of newness

 premchand ke ‘durgadas’ or chatur sen shastri ke ‘rana raaj singh’ ne to aiyaari-tilsmi-jasusi sahitya kaa tirodhan kara diya or yaheen se yah parampara samaapt ho gayi
 While writing about Hindi science fiction, people often refer to Keshav Prasad Singh's 'chandralok Ki Yatra' as the first science fiction
 abhi tak aisa hi abhimath he
 Perhaps the reason for this is the commentary of Pt
 Srinarayan Chaturvedi that he gave at the beginning of the story section of 'diamond Jubilee special issue' published to commemorate 60 years of 'saraswati' magazine
 ‘saraswati’ ke bhaag 1, sankhya 6, main pahili baar do kahaniyaan ek saath prakashit hui
 Kishori Lal Goswami's 'indumati' and Keshav Prasad Singh's 'travel to Chandralok'
 chaturvedi ji in par tippanee karte hai-duusari kahani kisi angreji kahani ke aadhaar par likhi hui maaloom hoti he
 She is tall and was published serially
 ‘indumati’ saraswati hi main nahin, hindi main aadhunik style kii pratham kahani he
 ' ‘chandralok kii yatra’ ko to unhone angl-aadhrut kahkar mahatvaheen kar diya lekin ‘indumati’ ko pahili hindi kahani ghoshit kiya
 'earlier' Harishchandra Chandrika 'and' Piyush Pravah 'had one or two stories
 pan ambika dutt vyas kii ‘aashcharya-vrittant’ naam kii or pan bal krishna bhatta kii ‘nutan brahychari’ naamak kahaniyaan sambhawatah iske pahile kii prakashit ho chuki thim
 But 'indumati' is credited with being the first modern story of Hindi
 ’ Probably he ended his talk by saying, but if there had been an attempt to investigate it, then the confusion would have ended which is the first Hindi science fiction? Although this discussion continues in Hindi, which is the first modern story of Hindi
 


‘indumati’ ? insha allaa khan kii 1803 main prakashit ‘rani ketki kii kahani ? yaa phir 1870 main prakashit meerut main pan gauri dutt pranit ‘devraani jethaani kii kahani’ jo vastutah ek laghu saamaajik upanyaas he

 Overwhelmed by his poetic brilliance, Bharatendu while publishing his poem in the 'kavibhaka Sudha' commented - 'the wisdom of this remarkable child is also unique and the state is only twelve years old

 In his childhood, he surprised scholars by introducing his poetic power on many occasions

 Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was the first President of the French Republic and the second French Empire as Napoleon III
 vah napolian pratham kaa bhatija tathaa uttaradhikari tha
 Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was the most adventurous and eccentric of the nineteenth-century rulers of Europe
 yah napolian mahaan ke bhai lui bonapart tathaa napolian kii sauteli ladki josephin kii putree harteys buharneis se paris main 1808 i

 At that time, his uncle Napoleon the Great was at the pinnacle of his pride

 While there, he got education under the care of his mother

 Louis Napoleon was educated and initiated in an environment where his family traditions became synonymous with the French Revolution and nationalism
 france se vienna kii vyavastha ko samaapt kar bonapart vansheey shashan sthapit karnaa lui napolian kaa jivan lakshya bana
 Louis Napoleon, as a member of the Italian revolutionary party Carbonari, participated in the failed 1831 agitation against the Pope
 lui napolian ne strassvarg ke durgrakshakon dwaara ek asafal vidroh karaayaa jiske parimanswaroop france ke shaasha lui philip dwaara use america bhej diya gaya

 As a result of this creation, some orthodox and mythological fictions started taking place all over France about Napoleum

 The then French ruler Louis Philippe also formally showed his faith to this fact and in August, 1840 AD, he stole Napoleon the Great's ashes from St
 Helena and installed it with complete sanctity

 longinus paramparaagat rup se "kavy main udaatt tatv" naamak kriti kaa rachanaakaar mana jaataa he
 The effects of good writing are discussed in this work
 longinus kaa asli naam gyaat nahin he
 He was a teacher of Greek Kavyalochan
 uskaa kaal pehali se lekar teesri shadi tak hone kaa anumaan he
 Longinus has proposed this theory considering the elements that make poetry better
 ve udaatt ko kavy ko shreshth banane vaala tathaa kavi ko pratishtha dilaane vaala tatv maanate hai
 It is rooted in the dignity of lofty great ideas organized ornamentation plan, aristocratic designation and influence
 ve vagadambar baleyata or bhavanumbar ko udaadtta main baadhak tatv maanate hai
 Just as in Indian poetry, different views have been made about the nature of poetry and its soul, similarly in the field of western criticism, different thinkers have discovered the origin of poetry or literature in different eras
 plato ne anukaran ko sahitya kaa mul tatva mana
 Pallavan Aristotle did this with his vision and accepted Virechan as the object of literature
 isi prakaar lonzinus kaa udaatt siddhanth he
 Through this theory, he has made it clear that no artwork or poetry can be a masterpiece without a sublime element
 shreshth vahi he jisamen rachayita kaa gahan chintan or anubhutiyaan rahati hai
 This feeling of the creator makes the creation great due to its greatness, sublime, grandeur or dignity
 rachana yaa kriti shilp ke dwaara abhivyakti paati he; kintu udaatt rachana kaa lekhak apni rachana main shilp ke soundarya kii adhik chintaa na karke usamen nihit anubhuti ko hi sabal banane kaa ytn karata he
 Acharya Longines, who presents this sublime principle
 inkaa unani bhashaa kaa naam longinus tathaa angreji bhashaa main uccharit 'lonzinus' he
 His work is titled 'perihutsuus', which was translated into English as 'on the Sublime'
 isi ko hindi main udaatt kii sangya di gai
 Its book is the main text of Western literature
 lonzinus ne udaatt kii paribhaasha or uskaa saamaanya parichay jis rup main diya he usase prathit hota he ki unke samay main yah shabd itnaa adhik prachlit ho gaya tha ki unhone iskaa vistrut parichay dene kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi
 Still, clarifying the nature of the sublime, he said this much- arthath abhivyakti kii vishistataa or shreshthata kaa naam udaatt he
 By aiming at this, Hindi critics have accepted that the lofty element in a composition is expressed by appropriate and dignified word-legislation, a rhetorical scheme of impulse, and composition-legislation
 lonzinus ne kavy ke udaatt ko vaktruta se ekadam bhinn bataaya he, kyonki kavy main shrotaaon par udaatt kaa prabhaav tanmayata ke rup main hota he, pravartan ke rup main nahin
 For this reason, in the sight of Longinus, there is a grand poem which, due to the joyousness, makes us so engrossed and attuned to reach such a high sense where the subject of the light is illuminated like electric light
 is drushti se lonzinus ko anandatirek or vishwanath ke vigalit-vedyantar main bahut kuch samya dekha ja saktaa he
 In the form of the sublime, both the psychological and the behavioral aspects were exposed in Longinus
 isi se unhone ek ore udaatt ke aantarik tattvon kaa ullekh kiya he or duusari ore uske bahya paksh kii bhi vivechna kii he
 What is Sublime Basis? Is it based on the innate talent of the speaker or writer, or can it be considered by the rise of education or dependent on practice? Longinus has followed the Middle Way, considering these questions
 unke vichaar se udaatt na to sarvatha pratibha saapeksh he or na purnatah abhyaas-saapeksh
 In fact, the basis of the sublime is not one aspect, one quality or one tendency of the person but a glimpse of the entire personality behind it
 atah udaatt kaa sristaa udaatt vyaktitv hi ho saktaa he
 Only a person of great genius, high scholar and celebrity can be a sublime or an announcer
 lonzinus ke anusaar - ‘‘udaatt aatma kii mahanata kaa pratibimb he
 True sublime is attainable only in those whose consciousness is sublime and development oriented
 yah sarvatha swaabhaavik he ki jinke mastishk udaatt dharanaon se paripurna he unheen kii vaani se udaatt shabd zankrut ho sakate hai
 '' is prakaar udaatt kaa sambandh keval pratibha, adhyayan or bhashaa ke adhyayan se nahin, apitu vyakti ke samooche vyaktitv se he
 In conclusion uskaa prabhaav kramik nahin, aakasmik hota he or uske alolik alok se katha chamak uthati he
 Although the foundation of the sublime lies in the greatness of the personality of the litterateur, in order to bring the element of sublime into the composition, Loninus has discussed five sources - uparyukt paanchon tattvon main se pratham do janmajaat arthath kavi-pratibha ke ang hai or shesh teen kala sambandhi visheshtaayen hai
 The first place among the sources of the sublime is the importance of thought
 isi ko lonzinus ne shabd-bhed se aatma kii bhavyata bhi kaha he
 His clear statement is - "the soul of the sublime great is echoed
 ’’ yadi aatma kii yah mahatta naiysargik na ho to utkrisht vichaaron dwaara use praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Great words come out of his mouth in which thoughts are deep and deep
 mahaan vichaaron se sampann, atmotthanayukt sahityakar hi udaatt-srijan kar sakate hai
 This is such a concept of Longinus, to which his concept of sublime effect is also connected
 udaatt kaa prabhaav atmatikraman hota he, anunayan nahin
 This belief specializes that soul-order is possible only with the graceful expression of grand and great ideas
 vastutah atmik mahanata udaatt srujana kii pehali shart he, isiilie udaatt kaa prabhaav bhi natikrup se kalyankari hi mana jayega
 Thus the effect of sublime literature should be considered to be good from both moral and artistic point of view
 is drushti se lonzinus or mahakavi milton ek hi str par utarate hai
 According to Milton, to become a great litterateur one should emulate great and highly honorable things
 milton kaa mat he- Manavis easily get this grand voice
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki pratibhashali kavi apane jivan ke sandhya kaal main ast hote hue surya kii tarah thanda ho jaataa he or uske parvarti kavy main udaatt kii kami dikhaai dene lagati he
 Homer has the same astral-gamini talent in Odissi
 lonzinus kaa kathan he- ‘‘iliyat homer kii tarunai kii rachana hai, kyonki isamen gati or sangharsh kaa prachurya hai
 In contrast, the majority of the Odyssey are narrative, a product of old age
 ’’ hindi main maithilisharan gupt ke ‘vishnu priya’ or ‘ratnavali’ isi prakaar ke kavy hai, jinamein inaki pratibha kaa apakarsh dekha ja saktaa he
 The later poetry of Pant and Bachchan are also examples of this
 lonzinus ne kalakriti main uddaam aavegon kii anivaaryta par bal diya he, kyonki kriti ke mahaan hone ke liye yah aavashyak he ki pathakon ko bhaavnaatmak uttejnaa pradaan kare
 Emotions or grand impulses are those from which the 'soul' starts to rise on its own and then gets filled with joy
 lonzinus ne aavegon ke do varg banaae hai- ek bhavy or doosraa nimna
 High impulses in grand impulses, ie, exalted emotion, compute probability, respect, amazement, gaiety and valor etc
, while low impulses are associated with compassion, grief and fear
 kavy main udaatt bharne ke liye ucch bhavaveshon kaa grahan tathaa nimna bhavaveshon kaa tyaag hona chahie
 Longinus is of the view that the use of ornaments should be done in such a manner that no one should notice that it is ornamentation
 kala jab kaushalpurvak prayukt kii jaati he to vah apane soundarya or chamatkaar ke vinyas ko kho detii he
 Actually do not marvel at the ornamentation, but it should be for joy
 lonzinus ne athishaymulak alankaaron ko udaatt kaa hetu mana he
 According to him, sublime exists in elaborations like elaborations, oaths, questioning, antonyms, defaults, repetition, articulation, accumulation, essence, transformation, synonyms, exaggeration etc
 atah udaatt ke liye alankaaron kaa sahaj or auchitypurna hona anivaary he
 For example abhijaat abhivyakti se lonzinus kaa taatpary kavy bhashaa he
 He has laid special emphasis on language excellence; Because the expression of sublime is through language
 padaavalee kaa vishayanukool, upyukt prabhaav evam sugumphit hona anivaary he, kyonki urjaswit bhashaa ke prayog dwaara rachanaakaar aisi kriti kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he, jiskaa prabhaav durnivaar ho
 Through appropriate and effective vocabulary, the composition incorporates the qualities of grandeur, dignity, ooze, madave, power etc
 and communicates aliveness
 rachana-vidhaan kaa arth he samanjit shabd-yojana yaa ek nishchit kram se shabdon kii yojana
 According to Longinus, the mutual harmony of various elements makes the work dignified
 jaise sharir ke vibhinn avyavon ke swatantra rahane par koi mahatva nahin he, sabase milane par hi sampoorn sharir kii rachana sambhav hoti he, usee prakaar samast tattvon ke sanyog dwaara hi garimamay kriti kii rachana hoti he
 When all the elements of composition are tied together in a series of harmony, then only they become sublime
 anyathaa vah bikhar jaataa he
 Sometimes the harmony of the composition elements supplies the damage that arises from a particular element of the composition and thus this harmony keeps the sublime effect intact
 atah garimamay evam bhavy rachana-vidhaan bhi udaatt-srijan kaa poshak he
 Longinus has also considered the opposing elements of sublime
 unhone baleyata, asanyat vagvistaar, ast-vyast pad-rachana, hin arth vaale shabd, bhavadambar or shabdaadambar, avaanchit sankshiptata, anaavashyak saaj-sajja, sangeet va lay par atyadhik bal aadi ko udaatt kaa virdohi tatva mana he
 Therefore, the best poet should not place them in his composition
 yah style kaa baari dosha he
 'baleya' literally means 'childish'
 bacchon main jaise chapaltaa, sanyamheenata, halkaapan or kshudrata pai jaati he, vaise hi baleyata kaa dosha us style main mana jayega
 In which to perform the eloquence without restraint, the use of words denoting petty meaning and playful or unstable footsteps
 isamen style kritrim ho jaati he
 According to Longinus- bhav kii garima ke abhaav main alankrita or baari shabdon kaa prayog
 Such as the use of the word 'living samadhi' for a small substance like a deer
 vagadambar udaatt atikaraman ke prayaas se utpann hota he
 Where the author behaves like a drunkard, he often expresses unexpected, meaningless and inconsistent impulses, ie impulse to be expressed even when impulse control is required
 aaveg kii abhivyakti bhavadambar ko janm detii he or udaatt kaa hraas karti he
 The exaggerated statement is rhetoric in the fascination of influencing people
 hindi main bihari ke oohatmak dohe isi dosha se grast hai
 For example, Longinus is of the opinion that the use of the words 'eye-eye' for women, 'chakshu-podak' and 'eye-virgin' for 'effigy' is mere rhetoric, not a metaphor of language
 parvarti samikshakon main higel ne udaatt ke swaroop ko spasht karne ke liye uski tulana soundarya se kii he
 According to him, beauty means harmony
 soundarya main vastu or kala paksh kaa saamanjasy rahata he
 Sublime situation is different from beautiful
 udaatt vah he jahaan uskaa bhav uske rup kii apeksha adhik prashast or vilsht hota he
 Hegel also believes that at the core of the sublime is the excellence of ideas and that the importance of ideas is born from a person's high character
 vyakti kaa charitra mahaan he to uske vichaar bhi mahaan honge
 Edmund Burke clarified the nature of the sublime on the basis of the genius-enriched imagination and the vastness of thought, etc
, by Longeus, that the object or creation has the power to influence and which can surprise the observer with its innovative effect That is, one should understand the sublime
 udaatt-tatva kii rachana kaa udhaaharan ham pyramid tathaa ramcharitra-maanas ke sundar kand main prastut hanuman ke viraat rup, mahabharat main krishna ke viraat rup aadi ko le sakate hai
 Burke has also accepted within the sound of sublime substances such as heavy thunderstorms, huge falls, lightning thunder, howls of cannons also have sublimate elements
 vastutah soundarya kii apeksha akkhadpan udaatt se adhik nikat hai
 Anand's reputation as a poet-work is such a gift of Longines that distinguishes him on the one hand from a rhetorician like Horace and on the other from a poetess like Aristotle
 arestu kaa virechan ek prakaar kaa upachaar he, jisaki pariklpana visheshkar traasadee ke sandarbh main kii gai he, jabaki lonzinus kaa ‘anand’ ek uplabdhi he, jiskaa poshak aadhaar mahakavy traasadee, pragit aadi sabhi tak vistrut hai
 In fact, the sublime has been discussed and analyzed the most in the 'peri Ipsus' of Longines
 lonzinus kaa udaatt siddhanth paashchaatya samiksha kii dein he
 His 'sublime' is an expression of the earned side of life, there is no place for the sweet side
 atah jivan ke aadhe paksh kaa vivechan karne ke kaaran unka shaastra adhuraa he
 Where is the perfection of Indian poetry, which also has the melody with oz
 ek ore vir or adbhut ras he to duusari ore shringaar or hasya ras hai
 He is a complete human work
 lonzinus kii dharna main is ekangita kaa kaaran yah he ki usne apane granth kii rachana bhaashan-shaastra ke rup main kii thi, kavyashastra ke rup main nahin
 That is why the interpretation of important elements for successful speech is found in it

 Stalinism is largely the set of policies adopted by Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union to build a communist society
 rus main hui bolshevik kranti or uske netaa lenin kii mrityu ke baad teen dashakon main dhire-dhire ek raajnneetik parighatna ke rup main iskaa vikaas hua
 Since the life of Joseph Stalin, who was the head of the Soviet Communist Party between 1927 and 1956, some intellectuals had made a weak attempt to formulate a new ideology called marxism-leninism-stalinism
 isaki misaal disambar, 1934 ke pravada main prakashit karl radek ke ek lekh ke rup main milti he
 But this attitude was neither encouraged by Stalin nor other Soviet Communist Party theorists
 phir bhi is parighatna ke centre main maujuud stallin kii bauddhik or raajnneetik shakhsiyat ke kaaran ise stallinavaad kaa naam mil gaya
 This can be understood in two ways: as a project of building thirty years of socialism under the leadership of Stalin in the Soviet Union and ideological and organizational tendencies that emerged from this period which have given the Marxist politics all over the world Influenced as
 marxvaadi andolan ke bheetar soviet itihaas main stallin kii bhoomika or marxvad-leninavaad par stallin ke prabhaav kaa moolyankan karne ke bare main jabardast vivaad he
 In this context, the Marxists of the whole world are divided into three parts: one is the one who fully accepts Stalinism and declares it as the main practical form of Marxism, the second part is the dismissive distortion of Marxist experiment by rejecting it completely
 And the third part is that which, despite considering the influence of Stalinism as generally persuasive and positive, some of its The criticism of Hluon

 Joseph Visierovich Jugashvili, who was called Stalin's name among party workers, was born in Georgia on 21 December 1879 in the home of a poor cobbler
 unki padhai-likhaai tiblisi kii ek dharmik seminary main hui jahaan apane krantikari rujhaanon ke kaaran unhen aksar sazaa bhugatni padati thi
 In 1899, he became a professional revolutionary and started taking active participation in the Marxist movement
 kushal sanghathak or bhumigat raajnneetik kaam main maharath hone ke kaaran stallin ko krantikari halkon main pramukhataa milane lagi
 From 1904 onwards he united himself with Lenin and the Bolsheviks and in 1912 became a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee
 1902 se 1917 ke bich stallin anginat baar girakrataar hue, unhen lambi-lambi sazaayen di gayin or kai baar unka nishkasana hua
 In 1913, he was captured and sent to the far northern region of Siberia, from where he was released only after the February Revolution of 1917
 bolshevik kranti ke turant baad or grih-yuddh ke dauraan stallin party ke kai pramukh padon par rahe
 In 1922, Stalin, one of the earliest members of the Politburo, was appointed General Secretary of the party
 samaaj ke sabase nichle tabake se ubhar kar sarvocch padon par pahunchne vaale ve party ke ekmaatr netaa the
 After Lenin's death in January 1924, he defeated Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Bukharin, opposing his policies one by one, and by the end of 1929 emerged as supreme leader of the Soviet party and state
 stallin kaa dehanth paanch march, 1953 ko hua
 Stalin's critics often present him only as a master of manipulations and a leader with modest intellectual abilities
 lekin 1906 main hi prince kropatakin ke vichaaron kii aalochana karne vaali unki rachana anarkizam or soshalzim? kaa prakaashan ho chukaa tha
 His theoretical writing was characterized by a very simple expression which made him well-liked among the workers
 stallin mukhya rup se vishwa-kranti ke bina hi ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana ke siddhant ke liye jane jate hai
 From 1924 onwards, Stalin wrote and analyzed writing to reinforce his argument
 stallinavaad ko aksar ek vyakti stallin kii karistaani ke rup main dekhne kaa sarleekaran kiya jaataa he, par is raajnneetik parighatna ke peeche maujuud sanrachanagat kaarnon kii samaj zaruri he
 The communist power established as a result of the Bolshevik Revolution consisted of two conflicting dimensions
 ek taraf usamen sovieton ke rup main aam janata kii sidhi bhagidaari ke pahalu the jinamein pratyaksh loktantr kii jhalak dikhti thi
 This form of democracy seemed better and radical than the market-based liberal democracy that was developing in Western countries
 duusari taraf ek nayi udiyaman vyavastha ko ek anushaasit kaaryakrtta aadhaarit communist party dwaara nirdeshit-niyantrit kiya ja rahaa tha
 This party was in the hands of Lenin, who believed in the role of the party based on the dictatorship of the proletariat, democratic centralism and revolutionary avant-garde squad
 1920 main prakashit apni rachana vampanthi communism : ek bachakaana marz main unhone spasht kar diya tha ki soviet satta kii taratamyata kaa kram kya rahegaa
 Above all the leaders, then the party, then the working class and then the public

 The civil war that took place between 1918–21, the two years that followed, and then the period between 1924–27 have historically given a contradictory name to ‘totalitarian democracy’
 samajha jaataa he ki stallinavaad kaa beej isi mukaam par padaa
 In the following years, a number of institutional and ideological methods were invented in the name of combating the 'capitalist and imperialist siege' of the first socialist state by Western forces
 inamen kuch ko chhod kar har ek ke liye stallin khud zimmedaar nahin the
 After Lenin's death, his then party colleagues at the top leadership of the party and leaders vying for power were also partners in the beginning of the totalitarian and repressive tendencies on the basis of which the pragmatic foundation of the Soviet state was to be laid for the time being
 was
 roosi vidwaan mikhail ilyin ne stallinavaad kii parighatna ke vikaas ko kai charnon main baant kar pesh kiya he
 Several years of intense power struggle within the Soviet Party came to an end in December 1927 as the Party Congress
 is daur ko unhone navjaat stallinavaad kii sangya di he
 Criticizing the merits of the childish leftist, Lenin disagreed with the thesis of the continuing revolution promoted by Trotsky
 isse paanch saal pehle hi apane ek lekh main lenin ne sthapit marxvaadi najariye ke vipareet dikhaa diya tha ki asmaan aarthik-raajnneetik vikaas ke kaaran kuch deshon main yaa ek hi desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana kaa prayaas karnaa hoga
 It was from the Tenth Congress in 1921 that the process of cleaning up the party started by expelling those who raised the voice of protest
 1922 main party mahasachiv ke taur par kendriya sthiti praapt karne vaale stallin ne lenin ke is vishleshan ko samaj kar hi 1924 main apni rachana foundations of leninijam ke duusare sanskaran main ek desh main samaajwaad kii sthapana ke vichaar ko joda
 Stalin's contemporary Soviet theorist Nikolai Bukharin also endorsed the idea that socialism can be created in a country if the world's first socialist state could be guaranteed military security
 parjing kaa baar-baar istemaal karte hue stallin ne pandrahavin congress tak apni nitiyon ke virodhiyon se party ko mukt kar liya
 Appointment to every party post came into his hands and he set up special departments in regional party committees so that all types of appointments could be closely monitored
 is tarah 1927 aate-aate soviet sangh main party-rajya ke rup main sarvasattavadi shashan kaayam karne kaa rasta puri tarah se saafe ho gaya
 The second phase is named as the emerging Stalinism which lasted till 1930

 The economy went completely under the planned control of the state

 About one lakh communists were expelled
 koi das fisadi puraane sadsy hathaaye gayi or naye audyogic mazaduron ko party kaa sadsy banaaya gaya
 Terming the period 1930–34 as early Stalinism, Ilyin has stated that during this period, Stalin announced to intensify the class struggle and tried to show that to protect socialism from capitalist intrigues against political opponents
 How is the Damanchakra important? 1933 main ek baar phir parjing kaa daur chalaa or party ke 18 fisadi sadsy hataa diye gayi
 But this time no new members were recruited in their place
 1934-41 kii avadhi sampoorn stallinavaad kii thi
 Stalin's person-worship was promoted during this period
 stallinavaad kii yah avadhi bolshevik kranti ke kuch mahatvapurn netaaon ke upar chalaaye gayi mukademon ke liye bhi jaani jaati he
 In these cases, leaders like Bukharin and Kamenev were sentenced to death by forcing them to confess their crimes
 isi avadhi main nomenkletura kii parighatna ubhari
 It was a Latin word meaning list of names
 nomenkletura main agrim naamazadagi kii prakriya ke madhyam se vibhinn cametiyon ke liye kaaryakrttaaon or netaaon ko shaamil kiya jaataa tha
 The inclusion of names in this list meant that the person would be controlled by the party system, the party would remove, promote, or be marginalized at any time
 milovan jilas ne stallinavaad kii aalochana karte hue nomenkletura ko naye varg kii sangya di he
 But this section of those who ruled in the Soviet Union was primarily a bridge between the party and the administrative machinery
 yah sarkaar ke niyantran or susangateekaran kii pranali kaa pramukh ang tha
 It confined the institution of the state to an administrative settlement
 1936 ke baad party-parjing kii jagah ‘janata ke gaddaaron ke kilaaf sangharsh’ kiya jane laga
 This 'struggle' was handed over to the Secret Police, under the supervision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, headed by Nikolai Yezhov
 1938 tak yezove ne stallin ke sidhe aadesh ke tahat jam kar rajkeey daman kiya
 The military victory of the Soviet party-state system in World War II gave a major boost to Stalin's person-worship
 vishwa-yuddh ke parinamswaroop soviet sangh ko america ke saath-saath duniya kii duusari mahashakti kaa darja mil gaya
 The period between 1945–52 is considered to be the developed Stalinism in which a socialist occupation emerged on the scale of the world under the leadership of Stalin
 is daur main marxvad ko vigyaan ghoshit karke sabhi tarah ke vigyaanon ko usamen samahit maan liya gaya
 Dialectical materialism and historical materialism began to be confirmed through arguments emanating from natural sciences
 stallin ne khud kai tarah ke vigyaanon ke bare main muhimen chalavaayin
 During this time, his own book on linguistics was published
 stallinavaad ko soviet sangh se baahar vishwa communist andolan kii pradhan pravriti banane main communist international yani komintern kii ullekhneey bhoomika rahi
 It was founded in 1919 by Lenin under the backdrop of the Bolshevik Revolution and the circumstances of the revolutionary upsurge in Central Europe
 iskaa sadsy banane ke liye har communist party ko laazmi taur par sudhaarwadiyon or madhyamargiyon se khud ko mukt ghoshit karnaa padataa tha
 Secondly, only those parties that could follow open politics as well as underground politics, following strict discipline and highly centralized rules of organization, could also become members of the communist campaign in their country's armies
 stallin soviet sangh main samaajawaadee arthvyavastha or saamaajik sambandhon kii rachana jis tarah se kar rahe the, komintern apni sadsy communist partiyon ko thik usee pattern par chalaane kii koshish karata tha
 In 1952, after a gap of thirteen years, the Nineteenth Party Congress was held in which Stalin played the role of various reforms in the party-state system
 is congress main party kii gatividhiyon par swany report pesh na karke stallin ne gyarjee mailencove se rapat rakhwai thi
 Some people thought that this was a preparation for a new round of purging
 darasal, yah parvartir stallinavaad kii taiyaari thi jise soviet sangh kii uttar- vishwayuddhin bhoomika kii roshni main kii jane vaali nayi taiyaariyon kaa aagaaz karnaa tha
 But after Stalin's death in March 1953, a power struggle erupted within the party in which Nikita Khrushchev emerged as Stalin's successor
 khrushchev ne dekha ki stallinavaad ke tahat arthvyavastha kaa aadhunikeekaran to ho gaya he, par krishi kii buree haalat he or upabhoktaaon ko buniyadi chizein bhi naseeb nahin hai
 He campaigned to free the Soviet system from the influence of Stalinism so that it could be made more economically successful
 unhone stallin dwaara kii gayi parjing ko marxvad-leninavaad virdohi qaraar diya
 However, many observers also believed at the time that it was almost impossible to make any kind of improvement in the form that the Soviet system had taken
