 Kishori Lal asks Suraj for Ganga's hand in his western culture's son Rajiv
 vah aashwast he ki ganga na keval ek adarsh dulhan hogi, balki vah rajeev main bhartiya mulyon ko punerjeevit karne main sakasham hogi
 Kishori Lal asks his foster son Arjun to help him pursue his plan

 Arjun goes before Rajiv to meet Ganga and is fascinated by meeting her
 arjuna, ganga ko apane aakarshan ke baavjood, kishorilaal kii ichchhaaon ke anusaar rajeev or ganga ko milaane kii koshish karata he
 Arjun betrays Ganga about Rajiv's character and habits
 rajeev or ganga donon arjuna ke prayaason se ek duusare se shaadi karne ke liye sahamat hote hai
 The engagement takes place in India, but the family agrees that Ganga should go to America before her marriage
 kuch hafton baad hi ganga akeli mahasoos karti he
 Her only true friend is Arjun with whom she begins to form a special bond
 dhire-dhire ganga ko pataa chalata he ki rajeev vah vyakti nahin he jaisaa arjuna ne use bharat main chitrit kiya tha
 Arjun realizes that he has fallen in love with Ganga
 lekin kishorilaal kii apni nishtha ke kaaran, vah use sahabhaagita jari rakhane ke liye protsaahit karata he or rajeev ko badalane kii chintaa baad main karata he
 Rajeev's hostile aunt Nita noted the growing friendship between Ganga and Arjun and warned Kishori Lal

 Kishori Lal then plans a short vacation for Rajiv to live with Ganga in Las Vegas
 las vegas main, rajeev nashe main padataa he or apane saathi bharatiyon ke liye uski avmaananaa prakat hoti he
 Ganga slaps Rajiv in a debate
 ugr hokar vah ganga se balaatkaar karne kii koshish karata he; ek hinsak sangharsh ke baad, vah use behosh kar detii he or bhaag jaati he
 Rajiv informs Kishori Lal who soon starts searching for the missing Ganga
 arjuna ko train stesan par roti hui ganga milti he
 He tries to persuade her to go back to Kishori Lal's house, but he refuses
 arjuna ne use bharat main uske parivaar ke paas surakshit rup se waapas jane main madad karne kaa vaada kiya
 After Arjun and Ganga safely reach India, Kishori Lal informs Suraj that Arjun has eloped with Ganga
 tab arjuna chalaa jaataa he, kabhi waapas na lautne kaa iraadaa rakhte hue
 Ganga's younger siblings and grandmother secretly advise her to elope with Arjun
 ab ganga ko pataa chalata he ki vah arjuna se pyaar karti he or uski madad se gupt rup se ghar chhod detii he
 By this time, Kishori Lal comes to India with Rajiv
 ganga ek mandir main arjuna ko pakadati he or maang karti he ki vah apana pyaar vyakt kare lekin arjuna abhi bhi kishorilaal ke prati vafaadaar he or usase shaadi karne se inkaar kar detaa he
 Rajiv comes with several thugs to kill Arjuna
 aagaamee ladaai main, arjuna buree tarah pit jaataa he lekin aakhir main sabko maar letaa he
 As soon as Arjun is about to kill Rajiv, Kishori Lal comes with Suraj
 arjuna ne kishorilaal ko yah sweekaar karte hue sunaaya ki vah sach main ganga se pyaar karata he
 He confirms that he never followed her and behaved honorably, while Rajiv rejected the honorable action in every way and lied about why Ganga returned to India
 na keval ganga pashchimi samskruti ke saath vilay karne main asamarth he balki pashchimi mulya ne lagbhag puri tarah se ganga ko barbaad kar diya gaya tha
 Ganga confirms Rajiv's attempted rape, which shocks everyone
 yah samajhate hue ki usne vastav main satya suna he, kishororal pushti karata he ki ganga uske bete se shaadi karegi
 Rejecting Rajiv, he embraces Arjuna as his true son and blesses the upcoming marriage between Arjun and Ganga with Suraj and his family

 The characteristic impedance or surge impedance of a homogeneous power line is proportional to the voltage and current flowing at the infinite length of this line
 ise z 0 { \ displaystyle Z_{0}} se nirupit kiya jaataa he
 This condition is also possible in the line of limited length if the reflection is made zero by some measure
 abhilakshanik pratibaadha kii esai maatrak om he
 For a lossless line, the characteristic impedance value is a completely real number, that is, it has no imaginary part
 
 yadi kisi simit lambaai ke transmishan line ko uske abhilakshanik pratibaadha ke maan ke baraabar pratirodh se jod den to shakti ke strot ko yah line ek anant lambaai kii line jaisi hi prathit hoti he or isamen sanket kaa paravartan nahin hota
 By applying the telegraph equation to the model of the transmission line in front, we get the following formula for characteristic impedance
 jisamen The following relation is there in the section phase of the transmission line, voltaic phase and characteristic talent- jisamen + { \ displaystyle +} tathaa − { \ displaystyle -} kramshah agragami tarang evam pashchgaami tarang kii dhara evam voltata nirupit karte hai
 If there is no loss of energy in the transmission line, r { \ displaystyle R} and g { \ displaystyle G} will be zero
 tab abhilakshanik pratibaadha kaa sutara nimnlikhit ho jaataa he- Often the same formula is used to derive the characteristic impedance of all lines, ignoring degradation

 In 1633, 69-year-old Old Galileo was ordered by the Church to publicly apologize, saying that his doctrine against religious beliefs was the biggest mistake of his life for which he is ashamed

 The glycemic index, glycaemic index, or GI is a measure of the effect of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels
 jo carbohydrate pachan ke dauraan teji se tuutate hai or raktadhara main glucose ko teji se chhodte hai, unamem ucch jiaai hota he; jo carbohydrate rakt dhara main dhire-dhire glucose chhodte hue bahut dhire-dhire tuutate hai unamem nimna jiaai hota he
 This concept was developed by Dr
 David J
 at the University of Toronto
 His research was done by Jenkins and his colleagues in 1980–1981 to find out which food is best for people with diabetes
 ek nimnatar glysemic suchakank carbohydrate ke pachan or avasorana kii dhimi dar ko ingit karata he or liver or paridhi se carbohydrate-pachan ke utpaadon ke vyapak nishkasana kaa bhi sanket de saktaa he
 a lower glycemic response usually, but not always, meets the demand for lower insulin and can improve blood sugar control and blood fat in the long run
 insulin suchakank bhi upyogi he, kyonki yah bhojan par insulin pratikriya kii ek sidhi maap pradaan karti he
 The glycemic index of a food is defined as the area following the ingestion of a certain portion of carbohydrate within a two-hour blood sugar response curve
 pareekshan bhojan kii eusi ko maanak eusi dwaara vibhajit or 100 dwaara guneet kiya jaataa he
 The average GI value is calculated from data collected from 10 human subjects
 maanak or pareekshan donon bhojan main carbohydrate kii baraabar maatra uplabdh honi chahie
 As a result, a relative ranking is determined for each tested meal
 paribhaasha dwaara ise 100 kaa suchakank maan dete hue, maujuuda maanya tareeke glucose kaa istemaal sandarbh bhojan ke rup main karte hai
 It has the advantages of being universal and producing a maximum GI value of around 100
 jiaai maan kaa ek alag set dekar safed bread kaa upyog bhi sandarbh khaadya ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 It is easy for people whose basic food carbohydrate source is white bread to directly state whether a rapid or slow blood sugar response will occur as a result of substitution of other food in place of the original dietary diet
 is pranali kaa nuksaan yah he ki sandarbh khaadya acchhee tarah se paribhaashit nahin hai or jiaai paimaana culture par nirbhar he
 GI values can be interpreted intuitively as a full-scale percentile and are generally interpreted as: ek nimna jiaai bhojan glucose ko apekshaakrit dhire dhire or lagaataar chhodte hai
 a high GI causes increased sugar levels in food and is suitable for a patient with endurance exercise or with hypoglycemia
 khaadya padaarthon ke glysemic prabhaav bahut saare karkon par nirbhar karte hai jaise, starch ke prakaar, khaadya padaarthon ke andar starch anuon kii bhautik jaalsaji, bhojan ke andar vasa evam protein or carbonic amla yaa bhojan main unke namak- udhaaharan ke liye, benigar ko shaamil karte hue, jiaai ko kam kar denge
 Fat or soluble dietary fiber can decrease the rate of gastric emptying and thus reduce GI
 saamaanya taur par, adhik maatra main fibre ke saath aprishkrut bread, safed bread kii tulana main kam jiaai maan vaale hote hai
 Many brown breads, however, are treated with enzymes to soften the crust, making starch more concentrated
 jabaki makkhan yaa tel milaane se bhojan kaa jiaai kam ho jayega, lekin jiaai kii ranking nahin badalegi
 taatpary yah ki milakar yaa milaae bina bhi ek nimna jiaai bread kii tulana main safed bread main ucch rakt sharkara karv maujuud rahata he jaise ki panparnicel
 The glycemic index can only be applied to food containing a reasonable carbohydrate content, as the test relies on subjects consuming more test food to yield 50 grams of available carbohydrate
 kai falon or subjiyon main prati parosan bahut kam carbohydrate hote hai or ausat vyakti sambhavat: in khaadya padaarthon se carbohydrate kaa 50 gram bhi nahin khate hai
 Fruits and vegetables tend to have low glycemic index and low glycemic weight
 yah gaajar par bhi lagu hota he jo mulat: or galat rup se ucch jiaai vaala mana jaataa he
 Alcoholic beverages are considered to have a low GI value, but it should be noted that beer has a moderate GI
 haal ke adhyayanon main yah dikhaaya gaya he ki bhojan ke pehle maadak peya grahan karnaa bhojan ke jiaai ko lagbhag 15% tak kam kar detaa he
 Drinking moderate alcohol before 12 hours of testing does not affect GI
 kai aadhunik aahaar, bazaar america or neutrisystem poshan bhojan dakshin samudr tateey aahaar dwaara awastharit glachemic suchakank par nirbhar karte hai
 However, others have reported that generally unhealthy foods have low glycemic indexes, for example chocolate cake, ice cream, or pure fructose, while potatoes and rice eaten in countries with low rates of diabetes Foods have a GI value of 100

 High blood sugar levels or repeated glycemic "spikes", followed by food, can promote these diseases by increasing oxidative pressure on the vasculature or by directly increasing insulin levels
 ateet main, postaprandial hyperglacemia ko mukhyat: diabetis se jude hue ek jokhnim kaarak ke rup main mana jaataa rahaa he
 However, more recent evidence suggests that it also presents an increased risk for atherosclerosis in nondiabetic populations

 The study, published in an American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that age-related adult macular degeneration was higher in 42 percent of people on a high-gi diet, and the study concluded that low-gi diet intake could eliminate 20 percent of AMD cases

 The first April of this year marks the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and India
 varsh 1949 main naye china kii sthapana ke baad ke agle varsh, bharat ne china ke saath rajanyik sambandh sthapit kiye
 In this way, India became the first non-socialist country to recognize the People's Republic of China
 china va bharat ke bich rajanyik sambandhon kii aupchaarik sthapana ke baad ke pichley 55 varshon main china-bharat sambandh kai sopanon se gujarey
 Their development was generally active and steady, but there were sweet and bitter memories in between
 in 55 varshon main donon deshon ke sambandhon main anek mode aaye
 In today's program, we will overview the political relations of China and India
 professor maa ja lee china ke aadhunik antarrashtriya sambandh anusandhan santhaan ke dakshini asia anusandhan centre ke pradhan hai
 He has been engaged in the research of political relations between China and India for thirty years
 shri maa ja lee ne pichley bharat-china sambandhon ke 55 varshon ko paanch bhaagon main vibhajit kiya he
 According to him, the relations between China and India were in the best period of history in the 1950s
 donon deshon ke sheersh netaaon ne tab ek-duusare ke yahaan kii anek yatraaen kin or unki janata ke bich bhi khaasi awajahi rahi
 The two countries then had close political ties
 lekin, 1960 ke dashak main china va bharat ke sambandh apane sab se sheet kaal main pravesh kar gayi
 Despite this, the friendly relations of the two are several thousand years old
 isliye, yah sheetkaal ek aitihaasik lambi nadi main ek choti lahar kii tarah hi tha
 By the mid-70s, they had once again come out of winter
 china-bharat sambandhon main shithily aayaa, to donon deshon kii sarkaron ke ubhay prayaason se donon ke bich phir ek baar rajdoot str ke rajanyik sambandhon kii bahaali hui
 From the 1980s to the mid-1990s, relations between China and India had warmed up
 haalanki varsh 1998 main donon deshon ke sambandhon main bharat dwaara paanch misile chhodane se phir ek baar thandapan aayaa
 But it ended immediately after the Indian Foreign Minister's visit to China in 1999 with the efforts of both governments
 ab china-bharat sambandh kadam ba kadam ghanishtha ho rahe hai
 The sino-indian relations are steadily improving over the years
 china va bharat ke varisht adhikariyon ke bich awajahi badi he
 Former Chinese Ambassador to India Chiyo Kang said, now china-india relations have entered a new era
 idhar ke varshon main, china va bharat ke netaaon ke bich awajahi badi

 unhone chini pradhanmantri van chaa paao ke saath china-bharat sambandhon ke siddhant or chaturmukhi sahyog ke ghoshnaptr par hastakshar kiye
 This manifesto revealed that the bilateral relations between China and India have entered a relatively mature period
 is ghoshnaptr ne anek mahatvapurn dwipaksheeya samasyaon va kshetreey samasyaon par donon ke samaan rukh bhi spasht kiye
 It was also considered as a milestone document directing the development of future bilateral relations
 china va bharat ke sambandh puraani neenv par or unnat ho rahe hai
 On foreign policy, China and India favor the establishment of a multi-polar world, oppose the dominion and politics of force and oppose any powerful country to become the world's police
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main maujuud vartmaan vivaadon kaa kis tarah nipataara ho or deshon ke bich kis tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya jaye ye do samasyaayein vibhinn deshon ke saamne khadi hai
 China and India believe that the five principles of peaceful coexistence enforced by them reflect the goals and principles of the United Nations Charter, which should be followed by various countries of the world
 shantipurna sashastitv ke paanch siddhant yani panchasheel china, bharat va myenmar dwaara varsh 1954 ke june maah main pravartit kiye gayi
 Panchsheel is an important contribution made by China and India to the peace and security of the world, and till date is on the tongue of the people of both countries
 deshon ke sambandhon ko lekar sthapit in siddhanton kii mukhya vishaywastu he- ek-duusare kii prabhusatta va pradeshik akhandta kaa sammaan kiya jaye, ek- duusare par akraman na kiya jaye, ek-duusare ke andruni maamalon main dakhal na di jaye or samanta va aapasi laabh ke aadhaar par shantipurna sashastitv barkarar rakhaa jaye
 These principles have been accepted by many countries of the world and are recorded in international conferences and documents on bilateral relations
 panchasheel ke itihaas kii charchaa main bharat sthit purv chini rajdoot shri chhan re shan ne bataaya, dwitiya vishvayuddh se pehle, asia va africa ke bahut kam deshon ne swatantraaa hasil kii thi
 However, after the Second World War, the colonial system began to disintegrate
 bharat va myenmar ne swatantraaa praapt kii or baad main china ko bhi mukti mili
 As the first to achieve independence in Asia, he found it imperative to maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries, and he needed the principle to direct the relations of different countries
 isliye, in teen deshon ke netaaon ne milakar panchasheel kaa aahvaan kiya
 Panchsheel made constructive contributions to the theoretical and real proceedings of international relations
 purv bhartiya raashtrapati narayanan ne panchasheel kii mahatvata kii charchaa is tarah kii
 Panchsheel still holds great importance
 vah kaaphi samay se deshon ke sambandhon ke niptaare kaa nirdeshak maapdand rahaa he
 To establish a peaceful world, it is very important to implement Panchsheel
 itihaas or antarrashtriya yatharth se jaahir he ki panchasheel kii jeevanishkthi badi majboot he
 It has been accepted by the wider public
 bhinn-bhinn saamaajik pranali apnaane vaale desh panchasheel kii vichaardhaara ko sweekaar karte hai
 People have recognized that Panchsheel is beneficial for peace and cooperation and fully matches international laws and norms
 aaj kii duniya main parivartan ho rahe hai
 The propagation of Panchsheel is very beneficial for solving some of today's problems
 isliye, panchasheel aaj bhi ek shantipurna vishwa vyavastha kaa aadhaar he
 It has a heavy meaning and importance even today and will remain so in the future
 shanti va vikaas kii khoj karnaa vartmaan duniya kii janata kii samaan abhilaashaa he
 Panchsheel's ideology of peace and development has led to the healthy development of international relations and in future also it will play an important role in establishing a peaceful, stable, just and fair new international order

 Many of its suggestions have been accepted by the governments of both countries

 Although there has been a huge improvement in relations between China and India, there have been some unsolved problems in their relations
 china va bharat ke bich sab se badi samasyaayein seemaa vivaad or tibet kii hai
 The Chinese government has always attached great importance to the problem of Tibet
 varsh 2003 main bhartiya pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ne china kii yatra kii or chini pradhanmantri van chaa paao ke saath ek sanyukt ghoshnaptr jari kiya
 In the manifesto, India formally stated that India considers Tibet a part of China

 In addition to this, the border problem between China and India has also remained unresolved for a long time

 bharat sthit purv chini rajdoot chyo kong ne kaha, itihaas se chhuti samasya kii ore hamen bhavishyonmukh rukh se prasthaan karnaa chahie
 The Chinese government has taken an active stand to resolve the border problem
 china aashaa karata he ki iske liye aapasi sulah auki vishwaas kii bhaavana ke anusaar, maitreepurn vaarta ke jariye donon ko sweekrut uchit va nyaaypurna tareekon kii khoj kii jaani chahie
 It is believed that when both sides depart from the desire of mutual trust, reconciliation and concession, then the sino-india border problem will be discovered by searching for ways
 is samay china va bharat apane-apane shantipurna vikaas main lage hai
 21st century China and India are rivals and friends too
