jis prakaar jantuon main chromosomon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he, usee prakaar vanaspatiyon main bhi unka adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Most seed plants are hermaphroditic, meaning they have male and female sexes together
 chromosomon kii gananaa hone par bhi ling kii charchaa keval nar-maadaa-vishleshan ke hi sandarbh main kii jaati he, kyonki ling or anuvanshikta kii samasya vanaspati jagat main nahin he
 Some species have separate male and female plants
 aise paudhon ke bhi eks tathaa vaai chromosomon kaa pataa chalaa he, jaise elodia canadensis, milandrium album aadi
 a seedling plant, Frageria elitior, is described as a bird with chromosomes
 kuch anya paudhon main nar vishmalingi hote hue bhi do vaai tathaa ek eks dhaaran karata he
 At the time of degradation, both y and x are separated and are formed by the formation of two y reproductive cells into a male and an x female embryo
 isi prakaar ling kaa nirdhaaran anya paudhon main bhi hota he
 There are some glands in the body of beings that are called ductless or endocrine
 kuch viksit visheshkar kasheruki jantuon main in grathiyon ke sraavon kaa, jinhen hormone kehete hai, adhyayan kiya gaya he
 Whether or not there are hormones in vegetation is also a controversial subject
 jantuon ke sharir main pai janevaali grathiyon ke naam hai : piyush, piniyal, avatugranthi, parathyroid, thimus, packrius yaa agnyashay, vrikk ; janangranthi, nar main vrushan tathaa maadaa main andashay 
 The hormones originating from these glands have been studied in detail and it has been found that the existence of secondary sexual traits related to masculinity in a male creature and femininity in a female depends on their action
 jin or chromosome keval yah nishchit karte hai ki yugmanaj nar hoga yaa maadaa
 Determination of actual masculinity and femininity and their development in the proper direction is done only with the help of secretions of the ductless glands
 jaise, koi bhrun purush ke rup main janm lene vaala ho to stri hormonon kii sooyee lagaakar athwa use badhiya kar dene or uske sthaan par andashay grathiyon ko aropit kar dene par vah yaa to purnroopen stri ho jayega, yaa usamen stritv ke lakshan viksit ha jaayenge
 xxrep 4 = naam -- nar—maadaa Tortoise - x x - x o kabutar—eks eks, yaa jed jed -- eks o, yaa jed dablyoo Bats - x o - x x chuha -- eks vaai -- eks eks 4 x 4 x x bhed -- eks vaai -- eks eks Chimpanzee - x y - x x jheengur, telchatta, tidde -- eks o, yaa eks vaai -- eks eks Sand - x - x o murga-- eks eks, yaa jed jed -- eks o yaa jed dablyoo Rabbit - x Y, or x o - x x kutta -- eks vaai -- eks eks Buffalo - x y - x x ghoda -- eks vaai -- eks eks Monkey — x y - x x drosophila -- eks vaai -- eks eks After proper study of flora and fauna, it has been found that the determination of sex is not the only result of male and female tendencies
 bhrun ke vikaas ke saath hi saath nar or maadaa nirdharak tatv bhi samaan rup se hi viksit hote hai
 An animal is not only male or female because it is formed by a particular number of chromosomes, but also male or female because it has "suppressed" other elements that are female or male determinants
 sabhi hormonon kaa utpaadan sharir main hota rahata he, at: jab stritv, yaa purushatv nirdharak hormone adhik shaktishaalee honge tab bhrun stri, yaa purush sharir tathaa pravritiyon kii ore agrasar hoga
 The result of the balance of hormones is that the creature is born as a male or female
 court stern ne yah dikhalaayaa he ki yadi kisi stri main do eks ke sthaan par teen eks hon, to usamen apekshaakrit adhik stritv hoga
 But such a woman will be late in the season, extremely young and completely barren
 isi prakaar goldshmit ne limetria japonica naamak shalab kaa adhyayan kar yah batalaaya he ki jab balavaan naron kaa nirbal kiton se sanyugman hota he tab 50% saamaanya nar or 50% antlingi maadaa kii utpatti hoti he
 But 100% of male pests are produced when highly powerful males are mated to weak females

 kriu bhi kehete hai ki bhrun ke ling kaa nirdhaaran keval chromosomon se hi na hokar, unamem paae janevaale jeenon kii tathaa alingsutron main paae jane vaale janakon kii antakriya se bhi hota he, jaise pakshiyon main maadaa vishmalingi eks vaai tathaa nar samalingi eks eks hote hai
 Sexual division in insects does not depend on the reproductive glands
 unke mukhya janakaatmak lakshan is prakaar hote hai : nar eks o, yaa eks vaai ; maadaa eks eks
 In 1923, Finkler cut off the foreheads of some male pests and applied them on females and the foreheads of females
 in prayogon main yah paaya gaya ki kiton ne apane sharir ke anusaar nahin apitu mastak ke anusaar kaam kiya, arthath nar mastak vaali maadaaon ne nar kii bhanti tathaa maadaa mastakwale naron ne maadaa kii bhanti langik lakshan prakat kiye
 There is a clear difference in the shape and form of the male and female of many animals
 ise langik dvirupata kehete hai
 It has been reported that in the third stage of sexual development, differences of male and female began to appear
 dhire-dhire andashay tathaa vrishanon kaa vikaas hua or sahaayak ang bhi kramash: viksit hote gaye
 Male and female genitalia are found in the same body in many lower organisms, and also in flora
 jyon jyon ucch varg kii ore badha jayega to yah milegaa ki ling spasht hi pruthak ho gaye hai or nar tathaa maadaa sharir kii rachana bhi pruthak he
 a familiar example of sexual dimorphism is a marine worm called Bonelia viridis
 isaki maadaa hare rang kii tathaa akruti main ber jaisi hoti he
 Under the stones or in their holes in the ocean floor, this worm lives
 vahiin se apni dwishakhit shund ko baahar laharaate hue yah jeev aahaar dhoondta rahata he
 The male worm is very fine and apart from the genitals, all its other organs are depleted
 maadaa ke sharir ke bheetar nar krimi paropjivi kii bhanti rahata he
 Fertilized ovaries develop like larvae floating freely in water
 yadi koi larva samudratal main baith jaataa he, athwa kisi maadaa ke shund main pahunch nahin paata he, to vah maadaa ke rup main viksit hone lagata he
 But if somehow he reaches by attracting the female to the Shunda, he develops into a male
 maadaa ke shund main bandi bouna nar, sarakate hue use munh main tathaa vahaan se bhi dhire dhire neeche sarakate hue maadaa kii janan nalika main pahunchakar, dimbashyon ko nishechit karata he
 The fertilized ovaries are re-released into the water and swim freely like larvae
 isi prakaar saculina naamak ek paraseete crusteshia nar tathaa maadaa kekadon par ashrith rahata he
 Giard and Smith have written that the body of this crustacea thrives in the crab's abdomen and some parts of the body also come out after penetrating
 jis kekade ke sharir main yah ghusata he, uske jananaangon ko yah chus daalata he
 Due to this, he becomes blind
 adhikansh kekade mar jate hai, kuch nar maadaa gunon se yukt ho jate hai, athwa maadaa kekade antarlingi banakar vrushan tathaa dimbashay donon utpann karne lag jate hai
 Gender linkage means variation in the sexes according to the genes found in sexual chromosomes
 in jeenon par jo gun yaa visheshak nirbhar karte hai, unhen ling sahalagnta kehete hai
 The transmission method of these traits or traits is called sex-linked inheritance, such as XY in male and XX chromosome in female
 koi purush yadi kisi anuvanshik dosha se dooshit he, to keval uske putr hi us dosha ko vanshagati main grahan kar sakate hai, putriyaan nahin
 First, in 1908, Doncaster threw light on this subject
 unhone ek shalab abracsas lacticler kii maadaa kaa abraxs grossulariata ke nar se sanyog karaayaa
 As a result, in the first generation, all moths of the genus Grossulariata were found
 duusari peedi main grossulariata tathaa lacticler ke anupaat 3:1 the, kintu sabhi lacticler maadaa nikle
 This showed that in this creature the male produces one type of gametes, but the female has two types
 at: nar samayugmaji tathaa maadaa vishamyugmaji hoti he
 Bravel states that the x chromosome contains some other types of genetic factors and genes
 yadi yah siddhant thik he, to samayugmaji mata pita ke visheshak unke vishamyugmaji santanon main chale jaayenge
 This principle is called gender cohesion, such as two x chromosomes found in the female of the fruitfly Drosophila and x y in the male
 iske eks chromosomon main laal aankhon ke jin honge, yaa shwet aankhon ke
 Red-eye genes are called effective and white is ineffective
 at: jab shwet tathaa laal aankhon vaali mackhiyon kaa sanyugman hota he, tab laal aankhon vaali santan adhik hoti he
 Haemophilia and color blindness are considered to be the major diseases among the sexes
 shukranu tathaa dimb sanyukt hokar ek yugmaj kaa nirmaan karte hai
 In the process of Khandi Bhavan, the same fertilized egg divides into several blocks until it becomes a complete embryo
 is prakriya main shukranu ke chromosome tathaa dimb ke chromosome ek saath milakar vibhajit hote rahete hai
 For example, 23 chromosomes of 23 male and 23 chromosomes are combined
 vibhaajan ke samay 23 chromosome ek chor kii ore tathaa 23 duusari ore chale jate hai
 These two ends are also called the daughter nucleus
 vibhaajan kii is saamaanya prakriya main anek prakaar ke dosha utpann ho sakate hai jaise ek centre main 22 chromosome chale jaaen tathaa duusare main 24, yaa koi anya durghatana ghat jaae to ise aviyojan kaha jayega
 Bridges is named with this principle
 inhone san 1916 main kuch utparivarti praaniyon kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 They found that both the x and x and x x y creatures were female, the XO animal was male, but incapable of child production and the OY animal did not increase
 jis praani main ek eks kam tha, use praathmik tathaa jisamen ek eks adhik tha, use gaun aviyojit kaha gaya
 Gender abnormalities occur as a result of the process of degradation
 ye asaamanyataayen mukhyat: teen prakaar kii hoti hai : stri purush ubhayalingi tathaa madhyalingi
 Stereotypes - Stereotypes include animals that have characteristics of both male and female, such as butterflies, birds and insect moths
 vaigyanikon kaa vishwaas he ki stripurush praani kaa jivan maadaa ke, jisamen eks eks upasthit he, rup main aarambh hota he
 When cell division begins
 us samay vibhajit koshika ke ek bhaag main chromosem kii sankhya main ghatbad ho jaati he
 As a result, only one y is present in a dividing cell
 is prakaar ke chromosomon kii asmaan sankhya ke kaaran nar tathaa maadaa kii akritiyon main bhinnata hoti jaati he
 Tests of the internal structure of such female-male beings reveal that their sperm and egg genitalia are also present
 yah asaamanyata un main adhik maatra main pai jaati he jinamein hormono kaa prabhaav atyalp hota he, athwa sarvatha nahin hota
 This is the reason why barbarism is not found in other developed and higher beings except for some birds
 ubhalingta - sansar ke lagbhag sabhi jeev ubhayalingi hote hai
 On the basis of which a creature develops in the direction of masculinity and femininity, not all scientists are unanimous in this regard
 koshika vibhaajan ke samay chromosomon kii sankhya main kyon antar aa jaataa he, athwa linganirmaan ke samay volfi tathaa mulari vahiniyon main se ek kaa kyon hraas ho jaataa he, yaa purushatv athwa stritv nirdharak hormone kisi niyam, yaa maatra se, kyon or kaise ni:sravit hote hai? in sab prashnon kaa koi santoshjanak uttar abhi vaigyanik nahin de paae hai
 Therefore, we will assume that being a man or a woman is a matter of coincidence
 prayek praani main yah kshamta hoti he ki vah nar, yaa maadaa main viksit ho jaae
 Bisexual is a vivid example of this
 ubhayalingi kai prakaar ke hote hai, jaise aise praani jo swanishechan karte hai, jaise hydra, feetakrimi, chapatakrimi aadi, duusare aise praani hote hai jo nishechan ke liye ek duusare par nirbhar karte hai; jaise kentua, jonk aadi
 In many species of plants too, some flowers in the same plant are found only in a particular part of the plant
 ucch shrenee ke anek paudhon main ek hi phool main strikesar tathaa punkesar samipsth hote hai taaki garbhaadhan main saralata ho
 In bisexuals, the internal and external characteristics of male and female are found simultaneously
 bhekon kii maadaaon main shukr tathaa naron main dimb granthiyaan praaia: saath saath pai jaati hai
 Egg testes have also been found in turtles
 kabutaron main nar kii shukr granthi dimb tathaa taramin kii maadaa ke dimbashay main vrushan paae gaye hai
 In crabs, testes and ovaries have been found together
 ilasmobrac machhliyon main niskriy vrushan or sakriy dimbashay saath saath paae gaye hai
 Some fish were also found which had two ovaries and one testis
 madhyalingta - yah vah sthiti he jab koi praani kisi ek ling kii ore viksit hote hote sahasaa, kisi karanvash, duusare ling ko bhi dhaaran kar le
 This is the condition of eunuchs in humans
 anuvanshikavigyaan ke anusaar aisi avasthaa kaa kaaran teen kayik, yaa daihik kromasom samooh ke saath do eks chromosomon kaa hona he
 
 is anupaat ke kaaran mackhiyon kii bahari akruti nar tathaa maadaa kaa mishran hoti he, yadhyapi janan se unke sharir main nar tathaa maadaa utak nahin paae jate
 They will be either male or female in shape
 aise praani vandhya hote hai
 Bravel has stated that the genital glands of the innermost are of the same type, but some or all of the supporting organs and secondary characteristics decide the other sex, and their actual development takes place only through the influence of hormones
 san 1923 main kriu ne kuch gharelu pashuon kii jaanch kii or paaya ki unamem mithyaa madhyalingta thi, arthath kuch main to nari jananaang atyant sankuchit the, kuch main sidhe or spasht, kintu anpekshit lambey the, tathaa kuch main spashtat: nar ke samaan, kintu apurna nalikayukta the
 Testis and ovum glands were also present in some
 purushon main kuch ko masik dharm hote tathaa kuch ko doodh pilaate hue paaya gaya he
 Lesions in the genitalia, or surgery, or hormone use can cause mediastinitis
 anek praaniyon main swat: ling parivartan hota rahata he, unka jeevanchakra is prakaar hota he : nar r ubhayalingi r maadaa 
 In Bonalia, parasitic crabs, horses, bees, taramines, and birds often undergo physical changes
 praaia: sabhi vaigyanikon ne murgo main langik parivartan kaa adhyayan kiya he or paaya he ki koi murga aarambh main maadaa tha or andey detaa tha, kintu, dimbashay main rog ho jane ke kaaran andotpaadan band ho gaya
 The hen's symptoms gradually started appearing in the hen and she started conception in the hens
 kriu kaa kahana he ki maadaaon main saamaanya dimbashay ke saath saath ek chota, alpavardhit vrushan bhi hota he
 The testis become active as the ovaries become inactive
 yahi sthiti un murgiyon kii hui jinaki dimbugranthiyaan katkar nikaal di gai thim
 An unusual event called the independent Martin is mentioned in the twins of the four-footed
 yah hormone prabhaav kaa udhaaharan he
 There are three types of twins: both male or both female, or one male and one female
 antim prakaar main aisa hone kii sambhaavna rahati he ki bhruneey vikaas main donon bhrunon main parsparik rakt kaa pravaah ek sharir se duusare sharir main hota rahe
 In such a situation, exchange of hormones can also take place
 nar hormone pehle viksit hota he or judawon ko nartv kii ore le chalata he
 The female hormone develops late and makes one of the twins fundamentally female
 falswaroop jo maadaa utpann hogi, usamen nar ke spasht lakshan honge or vah vandhya hogi
 Lily states that the twins of the quadruped have normal blood flow and that the female actually receives male hormonal blood
 anya pashuon main judawon main saamaanya raktapravaah kii vyavastha nahin hoti, at: unamem swatantra martin nahin hote
 The effect of sex change is also seen on humans
 praaia: samachaarpatron main padhane ko miltaa he ki amuk kaa ling parivartan ho gaya
 In the Olympic Chapters of 1935 and 36, two women were found who later became men
 manushyon main yauvanarambh ke purv yadi stri purush kii janangranthiyaan kaat di jaaen, to unka ling parivartan to ho jayega, kintu ve purnataya stri, yaa purush nahin ho sakenge or na to santonotpaadan hi kar sakenge
 Their expressions will be feminized, or masculine
 pakshiyon main lingaparivartan stritv se purushatv kii ore hi hota he
 This means the origin, status and rate of death of a male and female in any animal group
 yah anumaan kiya jaataa he ki kam se kam manushyon main pratham santan nar hi hoti he
 Most of the children are male even in the days of war, because nature itself fulfills the shortage of males
 praathmik ling anupaat kii baat keval manushya hi nahin, apitu pashu jagat main bhi lagu hoti he
 There are also more animals in those animals that live in harem, like some species of monkeys, honey bees, ants, termites etc
 ek ghoda anek ghodiyon ko garbhit karata he
 If she copulates more often, then the sex ratio can undergo a dramatic change
 murgi se balpurvak bachche paidaa karaae jaaen, to maadaa bachche adhik paidaa honge
 In relation to the secondary sex ratio, Creu has stated some rules: praaniyon kii jatiyon ke saath anupaat ghatata badhata rahata he, jaise 100 maadaaon ke anupaat main manushya nar 103-107, ghoda 98
6, kutta 118
5, choupaae 107
3, bhed 97
7, boar 111
8, khargosh, 104
6, murga 93
4-94
7, kabutar 115, machhlee, kots 188 tathaa lophius 385 hote hai
 Ratios vary by species, race and tribe, such as: 106 in the United States, 93
5 in Great Britain, 95
3 in Spain, 96
9 in Germany, 97
9 in France, 98
4 in Belgium, 99 in Italy, 100 in Poland, 102 are found in Japan, 104 in India and 125 in China, and 104–105 in Jews per 100 females
 lagic anupaat main prati varsh antar hota rahata he
 The special mating season of the year also has an effect on animals
 mata pita kii aayu or shaareerik avasthaa kaa prabhaav santanon ke anupaat par padataa he
 The chronological number of pregnancies affects the sex ratio
 do garbhon ke bich kaa kram bhi prabhaavshaalee hota he
 According to Kurt Stern, the number of males in illegal offspring is less than females
 dusron ke anusaar nagarikaran, sankaran, saamaajik aarthik avasthaa, bhugolic vaataavaran aadi kaa bhi prabhaav linganupaat par padataa he
 The sex ratio is determined by sex conversion in other animals, such as the ratio of male and female in the immature creatures of Geophorus hilary to 0
5: 1, but in mature creatures this ratio is the opposite
 nirdeshaank: 25°36′40′′N 85°08′38′′E / 25

 Bhai Parmanand was a great revolutionary of the Indian freedom struggle
 bhai ji bahuaiami vyaktitv ke swami the
 While he was an exclusive preacher of Aryasamaj and Vedic religion, he also earned a reputation as a historian, litterateur and educationist
 sardaar bhagat singh, sukhdev, pan ram prasad 'bismil', kartaar singh saraaba jaise asankhya rashtrabhakt yuvak unase prerana praapt kar bali-path ke raahi bane the
 Bhai ji's name as a patriotism, political firm and independent thinker will always be remembered
 aapane kathin tathaa sankatpurna sthitiyon kaa datakar saamana kiya or kabhi vichlit nahin hue
 You have written the history of India in Hindi
 itihaas-lekhan main aap raajaaon, yudhon tathaa mahapurushon ke jeevanavritton ko hi pradhanta dene ke paksh main na the
 Your clear opinion was that in caste, feelings, desires, aspirations, culture and civilization should also be given importance
 aapane apane jivan ke sansmaran bhi likhe hai jo yuvakon ke liye aaj bhi prerana dene main sakasham hai
 Bhai ji was born on 4 November 1876 in a Brahmin family of Kariyala village in district Jhelum
 inke pitaaji kaa naam bhai tarachandra tha
 Matidas, brother of this holy family, accepted the challenge of Aurangzeb by reaching Delhi with Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji to protect Hinduism
 san 1902 main bhai parmanand ne punjab vishvavidhyalay se snatakottar kii oopaadhi praapt kii or lahore ke dayanand anglo mahavidhyalay main shikshak niyukt hue
 Seeing your interest in India's ancient culture and Vedic religion, Mahatma Hansraj sent you to Africa in October, 1905 to propagate Indian culture
 darban main bhai ji kii gandhiji se bhent hui
 In Africa, you came in contact with the then prominent revolutionaries Sardar Ajit Singh, Sufi Ambaprasad etc

 Bhai went to London from Africa
 vahaan un dinon shri shyaamaji krishna verma tathaa vinayak damodar saavarkar krantikari kaaryon main sakriy the
 Brother came in contact with both of them
 bhai ji san 1907 main bharat laut aaye
 Along with teaching in Dayanand Vedic College, he was active in motivating the youth for revolution
 sardaar ajit singh tathaa lala lajpat raay se unka nikat kaa sampark tha
 During this time the Lahore Police followed him
 san 1910 main bhai ji ko lahore main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 But he was soon released on bail
 iske baad bhai ji america chale gayi
 There he propagated the Vedic religion among the diaspora
 vahaan martanak upnivesh main aapaki prakhyat krantikari lala hardayal se bhent hui
 a team of prominent activists was being organized here to bring revolution in India
 lala hardayal kii prerana se aap bhi is dal main sammilit ho gaye
 Kartar Singh Saraba, Vishnu Ganesh Pingale and other youths pledged to dedicate their lives for the independence of India under his inspiration
 1913 main bharat lautakar bhai ji pun: lahore main yuvakon ko kranti kii prerana dene ke kaary main sakriy ho gayi
 Bhai Parmanand visited several British colonies of South America and met Lala Hardayal again in San Francisco
 gadar party ke sansthaapakon main ve bhi shaamil the
 In 1914, he went to Portland with Lala Hardayal for a lecture tour and wrote a book titled 'tavarikhe-hind' for the Gadar Party
 bhai ji dwaara likhi pustak "tawarikhe-hind" tathaa unke lekh yuvakon ko sashastr kranti ke liye prerit karte the
 He returned to India with the aim of revolutionizing India
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki unke saath paanch hajaar krantikari bharat aaye the
 He was also among the leaders of the Gadar revolution
 unako peshawar main kranti kaa netritv karne kaa jimmaa diya gaya tha
 On 25 February 1915, Bhai ji was arrested in Lahore along with other members of the Ghadar Party
 unke viruddh america tathaa england main angreji satta ke viruddh shadyantr rachane, kartaar singh saraaba tathaa anya anek yuvakon ko sashastr kranti ke liye prerit karne, aapattijanak sahitya kii rachana karne jaise aarope lagaakar phaansi kii sajaa suna di gayi
 As soon as the news of the punishment was received, people from all over the country were agitated
 antat: bhai ji kii phaansi kii sajaa radd kar unhen aaajeevan karawas kaa dand dekar disambar, 1915 main andaman bhej diya gaya
 On the other hand, Bhai Ji was enduring inhuman torture in jail, in spite of his wife Mrs
 Bhagyasudhi's affection, she was caring for her family with full self-respect and courage
 andaman kii kaal kothri main bhai ji ko gita ke upadeshon ne sadaiv karmath banaae rakhaa
 On the basis of the excerpts written in Srimad Bhagavad Gita, he later composed a book titled "my last time of shelter"
 rajnatik bandiyon ko kathor karawas ke viruddh bhai ji ne do maheene kaa bhukh hadtaal kiya
 When Gandhiji received the news of his inhuman torture in Kalapani, he harshly condemned the torture by writing an article in "young India" of 19 November 1919
 unhone bhai ji kii rihaai kii bhi maang kii
 On 20 April 1920, Bhai ji was freed from Kalapani jail
 kalepani kii kalkothri main paanch varshon main bhai ji ne jo amanviya yatnaayen sahan kin, bhai ji dwaara likhit "meri aapbeetee" pustak main unka varnan padhakar rongte khadey ho jate hai
 a thrilling description of these tortures is also given in the "revolutionary Bhai Parmanand" text written by Prof
 Dharamvir
 jail se mukt hokar bhai ji ne pun: lahore ko apana kaary kshetra banaaya
 Lala Lajpat Rai was one of Bhai's unique friends
 unhone rashtriya viapeeth kii sthapana kii to uskaa kaarybhaar bhai ji ko saunpa gaya
 Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev etc
 used to study in this college
 bhai ji ne unhen bhi sashastr kranti ke yajna main aahutiyaan dene ke liye prerit kiya
 Bhai Ji wrote the book "veer Banda Vairagi", which became popular in the whole country
 congress tathaa gandhi ji ne jab muslim tushtikaran kii ghaatak niti apanaai to bhai ji ne uskaa kadaa virodh kiya
 That is why they stayed away from Congress movements
 ve jagah-jagah hindu sanghathan ke mahatv par bal dete the
 Bhai Ji exposed the conspiracies to divide the country by publishing the letter "hindu"
 bhai ji ne san 1930 main hi yah bhavishyavaanee kar di thi ki muslim netaaon kaa antim uddeshy mathrubhumi kaa vibhaajan kar pakistan kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 Bhai ji also warned that do not trust Congress leaders, they will betray the country someday
 baad main aap hindu mahasabha main sammilit ho gaye
 You got equal instructions and support from Mahamana Pandit Madanmohan Malaviya
 san 1933 i
 main aap akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha ke ajmer adhiveshan main adhyaksh chune gaye
 When Bhai ji's prediction proved to be true and the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan was announced, Bhai ji felt such an anguish that he could not overcome it and on 8 December 1947, he departed from this world
 bhai ji ke suputr dow bhai mahavir aaj bhi apane poojya pitashri ke padchinhon par chalate hue raashtra or hindu samaaj kii seva main sakriy hai
 In order to preserve his memory, a business study institute in Delhi has been named after him
 bhai ji dwaara likhit "hindu sanghathan", "bharat kaa itihaas", "do laharon kii takkar", "mere ant samay kaa aashray", "punjab kaa itihaas", "vir bandaa vairaagi", "meri aapbeetee" aadi sahitya aaj bhi is mahaan vibhuti kii paavan smriti ko akshunn rakhe hue hai
 Panchmul is a highly developed and densely populated village development committee located in Sainja district of Gandaki zone of Paschimanchal development area of nepal
 saanchaa:syangja jila ke gavisein The Uygur Khaganat, also known as the country of Tokuz Oguz, was a Turkish khaganat that lasted from 744 AD to 848 AD
 yah orphon uigur qabeele ke saradaaron ke adheen ek qabeelon kaa parisangh tha
 In 742 AD, the Uygur, Qarluq and Basmil tribes rose in rebellion against the Goekturk khaganat
 744 main basamilon ne goekaturk rajdhani otugen or raja olymish khan par qabza kar liya
 But in the same year, the Uygurs and the Qarlukas colluded and attacked the bus mills
 basamilon ke raja kaa sir kalam kar diya gaya or puure qabeele ke logon ko ghulaam banaakar yaa to anya qabeelon main baant diya gaya yaa chiniyon ko bech diya gaya
 The Uygur chieftain now became the treasurer of this new Kharagat and Qarluq became the governor under him
 ek saal ke andar-andar uiguron or karluqon main jhadpen shuru ho gai or karluqon ko majabuuran apni zaminein chhodkar pashchim kii ore janaa padaa
 Over time, the Tang dynasty of China had to seek the help of the Uygurs in 755 to crush rebellions within their territory and to avoid a Tibetan army invading from the south
 is samjhaute main ek chini rajkumaari vivaah main uiguron ko or ek uigur rajkumaari vivaah main chiniyon ko di gai
 In 757, China gave 20,000 silk bags to the Uygurs as a tribute, which at that time had a heavy price

 Although the Eiffel Tower was a symbol of the industrial revolution of the time and was widely acclaimed by the general public during the global fair, some prominent personalities criticized the building and called it "an eyesore"

 Ironically, many of the celebrities who initially condemned this tower were among those who changed their opinions with changing times

 The Eiffel Tower was initially built for a period of 20 years which was to be destroyed in 1909
 lekin in 20 saal ke dauraan tower ne apni upyogita vaigyanik or takneekee kshetra main sabit karne ke kaaran aaj bhi efil tower paris kii shaan banake khadaa he

 This article is about the later and lesser known 'gupta dynasty'
 adhik prasiddh gupt rajvansh ke liye dekhen - gupt vansh Another Gupta dynasty is found in the writings of Emperor Adityasen's abolition and the Devanavaranak of the emperor living Guptas who became rulers in Malwa and Magadha after the fall of the Gupta dynasty
 is vansh ke sansthaapak krishngupta the
 According to them, Shri Harshagupta, Jivitagupta, Kumaragupta, Damodaragupta, Mahasengupta, Madhavagupta, Adityasen, Vishnugupta and Jivitagupta were the rulers of this dynasty
 is vansh kaa purvakalik gupton se kya sambandh tha yah nishchit nahin he
 In order to separate them from the earlier Guptas, they are called Madhavagupta or later Guptas
 is nae guptavansh kaa utpattisthal bhi vivadagrast he
 Kumaragupta and Madhavagupta have been called 'malava Rajputras' in Harshacharita
 mahasen gupt anumaanath: malwa ke shaasha the bhi
 No articles of any king preceding Adityasena were found from Magadha region
 uparyukt tathyon ke aadhaar par kuch vidwaanon ne krishngupta ke vansh kaa utpattisthal malwa nishchit kiya
 On this basis, he was called Malavagupta
 kintu adhikansh vidwaan inhen magadh kaa hi mul nivasee maanate hai
 The early kings of this dynasty were probably feudatories under the Gupta emperors
 apasad abhilekh main krishngupta ko nrip kaha he evam samanarthak sangyaayen is vansh ke parvarti shaskaon ke liye bhi prayukt hui hai
 Which ruler of this dynasty first established the independent power of his dynasty is unknown
 krishngupta ke liye apasad lekh main keval itnaa hi kaha gaya he ki ve kuleen the
 His arms beheaded the elephants of the enemy like lions and won over their numerous enemies
 krishngupta ke samay main hi sambhavat: kannauj main harivarman ne moukharivansh kii sthapana kii
 Krishnagupta probably married his daughter Harshagupta to Adityavarman, the son of Harivarma
 krishngupta ke putr evam uttaradhikari sriharshgupt ne anek bhayanak yudhon main apana shaury dikhaaya or vijay praapt kii
 His successor, Jivitragupta, has been called 'kshitish-chudamani' in the abridged article
 unke atimanviya kaaryon ko log vismay kii drushti se dekhte the
 No such thing is known about the later emperors of Magadhagupta
 sambhavat: raajnneetik drushti se aarambhik madhavagupt adhik mahatvapurn bhi nahin the, isi se lekhon main unki paaramparik prashansa hi kii gai he
 Sufficient and definite information is obtained about Kumaragupta
 kadaachit unke samay main magadhagupton ne apni swatantra satta kii ghoshan kii hogi
 Kumaragupta defeated Maukhari Naresh Ishaanavarman
 unki safalataa sthaayee thi
 The territory up to Prayag was under his authority
 unhone prayag main pranotsarg kiya
 His son Damodargupta again defeated the Moukharis in battle, but he himself won the battlefield
 isi kaal main magadh putree ne malwa par bhi apana adhikaar sthapit kiya
 After Damodargupta, his son Mahasengupta became the ruler
 maukhariyon ke viruddh, apni shakti drudh karne ke uddeshy se unhone thaneshwar ke naresh rajyavardhan ke putr adityavardhan se apni bahan mahasengupta kaa vivaah kiya
 Kumaragupta and Madhavagupta's father, Malavaraja, were probably Mahasengupta mentioned in Harshacharit
 apasad lekh ke anusaar inhone lauhitya tak ke pradesh par akraman kiya or asambhav nahin ki unhone malwa se lekar bengal tak ke sampurna pradesh par kam se kam kuch kaal tak shashan kiya ho
 Mahasengupta consolidated the position of the Magadha Guptas, but soon the Kalachurineresh Shankaras took over Ujjayini in 595 AD or some earlier
 udhar valbhi ke maitra naresh shiladitya ne bhi pashchimi maalav pradesh par adhikaar sthapit kar diya
 In the meantime, probably at some time, the feudatory ruler of Mahasengupta, Shashank, declared himself independent in North and West Bengal
 sambhavat: magadh bhi mahasen gupt ke adhikaar main isi samay nikal gaya
 Why Mahasengupta ended up in such a situation is not known
 par unke donon putron kumargupta or madhavagupt ne thaneshwar main samraat prabhakarvardhan ke darbar main sharan lee
 In this chaotic situation, some Devagupta declared himself the ruler of Malwa or any of his regions
 is devgupt kaa koi sambandh magadh gupton ke saath tha yaa nahin, nahin kaha ja saktaa
 According to the records of Harshavardhana, Rajyavardhana ruled out the increasing power of Devagupta
 harshcharit ke anusaar devgupt ne gaudadhip shashaank kii sahaayta se maukhari raja ko parajeet kar unhen maar daalaa tathaa rajyashri ko bandi bana liya
 Rajyavardhana defeated Devagupta
 kintu devgupt aadi ne shadyantr dwaara unhen maar daalaa
 But after this, Devgupta was also defeated and respectively Harshavardhana established his power throughout North India
 apasad lekh se prathit hota he ki madhavagupt ne magadh par shashan kiya or praaia: apana sara jivan harsh ke samipya evam maitri main vyateet kiya
 Harsha may also have appointed Madhavagupta as the relative and friend of Magadha as the governor of Magadha
 madhavagupt ne harsh kii mrityu ke baad hi apni swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kii hogi
 In the abridged article, Madhavagupta has been called heroic, famous and defeating many enemies
 inke rajya kaa aarambh harsh kii mrityu ke sheeghra baad evam uskaa ant bhi sambhavat: sheeghra hi ho gaya hoga
 After Madhavagupta, his son Adityasena became the ruler of Magadha
 inke samay ke anek lekh praapt hue hai
 The title of his sovereign status is his 'maharajadhiraja' title
 devgarh se praapt ek lekh main adityasena kii chol pradesh kii vijay evam unke dwaara kiye gaye vibhinn yagyon aadi kaa ullekh he
 He also committed three Ashwamedhas
 unke kaal ke kuch anya janakalyaan sambandhi nirmaan kaaryon kaa gyaan lekhon se hota he
 Adityasen married his daughter to Maukhari Naresh Bhogavarman and his daughter, Bhogavarman's daughter, Vatsadevi was married to King Shivdev of Nepal
 nepal ke kuch lekhon main adityasena kaa ullekh ‘magadhadhipasya mahat: shri adityasenaray’ karke hua he
 It seems that Magadhagupta had great respect and dominance in Eastern India
 adityasena ke rajya kaa ant 672 i
 ke baad sheeghra hi kabhi hua
 After Adityasen, his son Devagupta sat on the throne of Magadha
 680 i
 ke lagbhag vaatapi ke chalukya raja vinayaditya ne sambhat: devgupt ko parajeet kiya
 He held the title 'maharajadhiraja'
 devvarnark lekh se spasht he ki devgupt ke pashchaat unke putr vishnugupt magadh ke shaasha hue
 The title Maharajadhiraj is also used for them
 inhone kam se kam 17 varsh tak avashya rajya kiya kyonki inke rajya ke 17wein varsh kaa ullekh inke ek lekh main hua he
 The last king of this dynasty was Jivagupta
 gomti nadi ke kinare inke vijayaskandhavar kii sthiti kaa ullekh miltaa he
 From this, it is estimated that they had attacked a region situated in Gomti against the Maukharis
 jivitagupta ke pashchaat is vansh ke kisi shaasha kaa pataa nahin chalata
 The end of the Magadha Guptas is also unknown
 gaudwaho se gyaat hota he ki 8veen sadi ke madhya kannauj ke shaasha yashovarman ne goud ke shaasha ko parajeet kar maar daalaa
 The defeated Gaudadhip is also called the ruler of Magadha, so it is estimated that the king defeated by Yashovarman was probably alive
 asambhav nahin ki goud naresh ne jivitagupta ko parajithakar magadh unase chin liya ho or swayan goud or magadh kii sthiti main yashovarman ke viruddh yuddh main maaraa gaya ho
 The following are the principal rulers of the later Gupta rule: 9 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 9 BC or the year before his birth is displayed as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India

 There is a famous saying that earthquakes do not hit people but kill buildings
 bukampon ke dauraan utpann bhu-companon se imaaraton main bal or virupan paidaa hota he
 It is therefore necessary to prepare the buildings with a view to withstand such forces and deformation
 imaaraton ke vyavhaar ko behatar karne main bukampi code madad karte hai taaki ve bukamp ke prabhaavon ko jhelane main sakasham ho saken tathaa jaan or maal kii adhik kshati na ho
 In order to provide assistance to design engineers in the planning, design, elaboration and construction of buildings, modalities of procedures in seismic codes have been designed in countries around the world

 bukamp ke itihaas vaale deshon main ucch viksit bukampi code taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 Therefore, countries such as Japan, New Zealand and the United States have detailed seismic code provisions
 bharat main imaaraton ke liye kodon kaa vikaas jaldi hi aarambh ho gaya tha
 Today in India, there is a considerable list of seismic codes that apply to a wide variety of buildings, ranging from mud or less strong masonry houses to modern buildings
 lekin, bukampi suraksha ko sunishchit karne kii kunjee ek aisi pukhta pranali main chhipi he jo in dizin code praavdhaanon kaa vaastavik nirmaanon main paalan kara sake or lagu kara sake
 Seismic codes correspond to the same for a particular region or country
 unamem sthaneey bukamp vigyaan, khatre ke sweekaarya str, bhawan praroopataaon tathaa nirmaan main prayukt samagriyon or vidhiyon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he
 Also, they are also indicative of the progress made by a country in the field of seismic engineering
 bharat main 1962 main ai es 1893 naamak pratham aupchaarik bukampi code prakashit hua tha
 The following Seismic codes are currently covered under the Bureau of Indian Standards
 in maanakon main kiye gaye niyaman yah sunishchit nahin karte hai ki sabhi parinaamon vaale bukampon ke dauraan sanrachanaon main koi kshati utpann nahin hogi
 However, to the extent possible, they ensure that structures without structural damage are capable of responding to earthquakes of moderate intensity and to earthquakes of high intensity without completely collapsing

 In India, 'darshan' is called the technique by which the element can be interviewed
 'tatv darshan' yaa 'darshan' kaa arth he tatv kaa saakshaatkaar
 Philosophy has been born in India only to eradicate human suffering and / or to conduct elemental interviews
 hriday kii gaanth tabhi khulti he or shok tathaa sanshay tabhi dur hote hai jab ek satya kaa darshan hota he
 Manu says that on receiving the right vision, karma cannot put a person in bondage and those who do not have a proper vision get trapped in the glorification and trap of the world
 bhartiya rishion ne jagat ke rahasy ko anek konon se samajhane kii koshish kii he
 About Indian philosophers, TS Eliot had said- bhartiya darshan kis prakaar or kin paristhitiyon main astitv main aayaa, kuch bhi pramanik rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa
 But it is so clear that during the Upanishad period, philosophy started developing as a separate scripture
 tattvon ke anveshan kii pravriti bharatvarsh main us sudur kaal se he, jise ham 'vaidic yug' ke naam se pukaarte hai
 Since the very ancient era of the Rigveda, we have a philosophy of dualistic tendency and dual goals in Indian thought
 pratham pravriti pratibha yaa pragnamulak he tathaa dwitiya pravriti tarkmulak he
 It is only by the power of wisdom that the first tendency works in the deliberation of the elements and the second tendency is able to review the elements with the help of logic
 angreji shabdon main pehali kii ham ‘intutionistic’ kah sakate hai or duusari ko reshanlistic
 There were two types of goals from the beginning itself - the acquisition of wealth and the interview of Brahma
 pragnamulak or tark-mulak pravritiyon ke paraspar sammilan se aatma ke aupnishadishth tatvagyan kaa sfoot aavirbhaav hua
 The knowledge of the Upanishads was emanated in the paradigmatic Vedanta, which proved the unification of the soul and the divine
 bhartiya manishiyon ke urvar mastishk se jis karm, gyaan or bhakthimay tripathga kaa pravaah udbhoot hua, usne dur-dur ke maanvon ke aadhyatmik kalmsh ko dhokar unhenne pavitra, nity-shuddh-buddha or sadaa svachh banaakar maanavtaa ke vikaas main yogadan diya he
 People call this Patipavani stream in the name of Darshan
 anveshakon kaa vichaar he ki is shabd kaa vartmaan arth main sabase pehla prayog vaisheshik darshan main hua
 The word 'darshan', according to Paninian grammar, is derived from affixing lute to 'darshi varshana' dhatu
 atev darshan shabd kaa arth drushti yaa dekhnaa, ‘jiske dwaara dekha jaay’ yaa ‘jisamen dekha jaay’ hoga
 The meaning of the word darshan is not just to see or to see normal
 isiilie panini ne dhatworth main ‘prekshan’ shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 The excellent test, in which observing or contemplating conclusions is taken by philosophy
 is prakaar ke prakrusht ikshan ke saadhan or fal donon kaa naam darshan he
 Where these principles are compiled, those books will also be named Darshan, such as Nyaya Darshan, Vaiseshika Darshan, Mimamsa Darshan, etc
 darshan granthon ko darshanashastra bhi kehete hai
 This scripture is derived from the word 'shasu Anushyau'
 darshanon kaa upadesh vaiyaktik jivan ke sammarjan or parishkaran ke liye hi adhik upyogi he
 Spiritual purity and elevation without darshan is rare
 darshan-shaastra hi hamen pramaan or tark ke sahare andhkaar main dipajyoti pradaan karke hamaara maarg-darshan karne main samarth hota he
 According to the Gita, Karma Kimkarmeti Kavayopatyatra Mohita: The attainment of ultimate goal and effort is possible only through philosophical knowledge, otherwise not
 darshan dwaara vishyon ko ham sankshep main do virgon main rakh sakate hai
 Cosmic and supernatural or physical and spiritual
 darshan yaa to vistrut sristi prapanch ke vishay main siddhanth yaa aatma ke vishay main hamase charchaa karata he
 Thus the subject of philosophy is both inert and conscious
 pracheen rigvaidic kaal se hi darshanon ke mul tattvon ke vishay main kuch na kuch sanket hamaare aarsh sahitya main milte hai
 Below are the first sutras of major philosophies which broadly introduce the subject matter of that philosophy- vedon main jo aadhaar tatva beej rup main bikhare dikhaai padate the, ve brahmanon main aakar kuch ubhare; parantu vahaan karmkand kii lataaon ke pratanon main fasakar bahut adhik nahin bad paye
 These sprouted in the Aranyakas and thrived in the Upanishads
 darshanon kaa vikaas jo hamen upanishdon main hamen drushtigochar hota he, aalochakon ne uskaa shriganesh lagbhag dau sau varsh isa purv sthir kiya he
 It is ancient from Mahatma Buddha
 itnaa hi nahin vidwaanon ne sankhya, yoga or mimasaa ko bhi buddha se pracheen mana he
 It is possible that these philosophies may not have existed at that time, although they were present in some form
 vaisheshikdarshan bhi shaayad buddha se pracheen hi he; kyonki jaisaa aaj ke yug main nyaay or vaisheshik samaan tantra samajhe jate hai, usee prakaar pehle purv mimance or vaisheshik samajhe jate the
 The emergence of Buddhist philosophy is believed to be two hundred years before Christ, but Jain philosophy is also ancient than Buddhist philosophy
 isaki pushti main yah pramaan diya jaataa he ki pracheen jain darshanon main na to buddha darshan or na kisi hindu darshan kaa hi khandan uplabdh hota he
 Mahavir Swami, who is considered the originator of Jainism, was also ancient to Buddha
 atev jain darshan kaa buddha darshan se pracheen hona yuktiyukt anumaan he
 The historical sequence of Indian philosophies is difficult to determine
 in sab bhinn-bhinn darshanon kaa lagbhag saath hi saath samaan rup se pradurbhaav evam vikaas hua he
 Many links have broken up here and there
 at: jo kuch shesh he, usee kaa aadhaar lekar chalanaa he
 In this sequence, even if there is no pure historicity, the series of gradual development has continued from beginning to end
 isliye praayah vidwaanon ne isi kram kaa anusaran kiya he
 Indian philosophy begins with the Vedas
 "veda" bhartiya dharm, darshan, samskruti, sahitya aadi sabhi ke mul strot hai
 Even today Veda-mantras are sung on the occasion of religious and cultural acts
 anek darshan-sampradaay vedon ko apana aadhaar or pramaan maanate hai
 In the modern sense, we cannot call Vedas texts of philosophy
 ve pracheen bharatvasiyon ke sangitamay kavy ke sankalan he
 They include many topics of Indian life of that time
 vedon ke in geeton main anek prakaar ke darshanik vichaar bhi milte hai
 It is from these seeds of contemplation that the Vanarajis of later philosophies have developed
 adhikansh bhartiya darshan vedon ko apana adistrot maanate hai
 These are called "theistic philosophies"
 prasiddh shaddarshan inhen ke antargat hai
 The philosophies which consider themselves independent of the Vedic tradition are also influenced to some extent by the Vedic ideologies
 vedon kaa rachanakaal bahut vivadagrast he
 Western scholars often composed the Rigveda around 1500 BC
 From 2500 BC Till is considered
 iske vipareet bhartiya vidvan jyotish aadi ke pramaanon dwaara rugveda kaa samay 3000 i
pus
 se lekar 75000 varsh i
pus
 tak maanate hai
 It is difficult to estimate the time of these ancient creations based on the known motions of history
 pracheen kaal main itane vishaal or samrudh sahitya ke vikaas main hajaaron varsh lage honge, isamen koi andeh nahin
 The available Vedic literature is a small fraction of the entire Vedic literature
 pracheen yug main rachit samast sahitya sankalit bhi nahin ho sakaa hoga or sankalit sahitya kaa bahut sa bhaag akramanakariyon ne nasht kar diya hoga
 The actual Vedic literature was so vast that it is difficult to imagine its creation
 nihsandeh vah bahut pracheen rahaa hoga
 In connection with the Vedas, it is necessary to clarify that "vedas", like the Quran and the Bible, are not the name of a single book, nor are they creations of any one human being
 "veda" ek sampurna sahitya he jisaki vishaal parampara he or jisamen anek granth sammilit hai
 In the religious tradition, the Vedas are considered to be eternal, unconquerable and divine
 aitihaasik drushtikon se ham unhen rishiyon kii rachana maan sakate hai
 The sages who created the Vedamantras are many
 vaidic sahitya kaa vikaas chaar charnon main hua he
 These Samhita are called Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads
 mantron or stutiyon ke sangrah ko "samhita" kehete hai
 The Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda are the codes of mantras
 inaki bhi anek shakhaayen hai
 The mantras of these Samhita were sung to praise the gods on the occasion of Yajna
 aaj bhi dharmik or saanskrithik krityon ke avasar par inkaa gayan hota he
 The musical hymns of the gods Indra, Agni, Varuna, Surya, Som, Usha etc
 are safe in these Vedamantras
 yajna or devopasana hi vaidic dharm kaa mul rup tha
 The spirit of the Vedas is not sanyasapradhan as in the later philosophies
 vedamantron main jivan ke prati aasthaa tathaa jivan kaa ullas otprot he
 The untruth of the world is not known in the Vedantras
 rugveda main loukik mulyon kaa paryaapt maan he
 Vedic sages pray for food, wealth, children, health, longevity, victory etc
 from the gods
 vedon ke mantra pracheen bharatiyon ke sangitamay lokkavy ke uttam udhaaharan hai
 The prose is predominant in the Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishadic texts, though their prose is also rhythmic
 brahman granthon main yagyon kii vidhi, unke prayojan, fal aadi kaa vivechan he
 In the Aranyakantha texts, there is an inclination towards spirituality
 jaisaa ki is naam se hi vidit hota he, ye vanprasthon ke upyog ke granth hai
 The Upanishads are dominated by spiritual thought
 chaaron vedon kii mantrasamhitaon ke brahman, aaranyak or upanishad alag alag milte hai
 Brahmins like Shatapath, Tanday etc
 are famous and important
 aitarey, taittiriya aadi ke naam se aaranyak or upanishad donon milte hai
 Apart from these, ancient Upanishads like Ish, Cane, Kath, Saiv, Mundak, Mandukya etc
 are the archetypes of Indian thought
 upanishdon kaa darshan aadhyatmik he
 The main goal of Upanishads is the cultivation of Brahma
 brahm ko aatma bhi kehete hai
 The "soul" is an indescribable and imperceptible element beyond all the permeable elements of the subject, body, senses, mind, intellect, etc
, which is chitsurapa, infinite and blissful
 sabhi parichchhedon se pare hone ke kaaran vah anant he
 Being uncooperative and one, the soul can form the basis of inner impulse and non-monopoly among humans in the discriminating world
 aatma hi manushya kaa vaastavik swaroop he
 By interviewing him, man becomes free from all the shackles of mind
 advaitabhaav kii purnataa ke liye aatma athwa brahm se jad jagat kii utpatti kaise hoti he, isaki vyakhya ke liye maaya kii anirvachaneey shakti kii kalpana kii gai he
 But spiritual advaitaabha is more important aspect of Vedanta of Upanishads than creationism
 yahi advaitabhaav bhartiya samskruti main otprot he
 This Brahmanism of the Upanishads in the field of philosophy became the basis of the later Vedanta views of Adi Shankara, Ramanujacharya etc
 vedon kaa antim bhaag hone ke kaaran upanishdon ko "vedant" bhi kehete hai
 The opinion of the Upanishads became the basis of Vedanta doctrine and sects later
 upanishdon kii style saral or gambhir he
 Serious elements of experience are expressed in Upanishads in a very simple language
 unako samajhane ke liye anubhav kaa prakaash apekshit he
 Experience of Brahm is the goal of Upanishads
 vah apni sadhana se hi praapt hota he
 Contact with the Guru is more helpful in that
 tap, aachaar aadi sadhana kii bhoomika banaate hai
 Karma is not a seeker of spiritual experience
 karm pradhan vaidic dharm se upanishdon kaa yah matbhed he
 Sannyas, asceticism, yoga, penance, renunciation etc
 have been given great importance in the Upanishads
 inamen shraman parampara ke kathor sanyasawad kii prerana kaa strot dikhaai detaa he
 Tapoist Jainism and Buddhism and Gita's Karmayoga have sprouted in the spiritual land of the Upanishads
 hindu dharm main darshan atyant pracheen parampara rahi he
 In Vedic philosophies, conspiracy is more famous and ancient
 gita kaa karmwaad bhi inke samakaleen he
 The conspiracies are called 'theistic philosophy'
 ve veda kii satta ko maanate hai
 Apart from various types of theistic philosophies in the Hindu philosophical tradition, atheistic and materialistic philosophical traditions have also existed
 maharishi gautam rachit is darshan main padaarthon ke tatvagyan se moksh prapti kaa varnan he
 The philosophy of substances leads to the elimination of false knowledge
 phir ashubh karmo main pravrutt na hona, moh se mukti evam dukhon se nivritti hoti he
 In this, God has been considered as the creator, formless, omnipresent and individual soul apart from the body and nature is unconscious and the cause of creation of the universe and it clearly depicts trivialism
 iske alaava isamen nyaay kii paribhaasha ke anusaar nyaay karne kii paddati tathaa usamen jai-paraajay ke kaarnon kaa spasht nirdesh diya gaya he
 This philosophy composed by Maharishi Kanad describes the true nature of religion
 isamen sansaarik unnati tathaa nishshrey siddhi ke saadhan ko dharm mana gaya he
 Therefore, performing rituals of religion is essential for human welfare
 is darshan main dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh or samavaay in chha: padaathon ke sadharmy tathaa vaidharmy ke tatvadhan se moksh prapti maani jaati he
 Religion and lawfulness is a special method of knowledge, without which it is not possible to solve the misconceptions
 iske anusaar chaar pair hone se gaay-bhens ek nahin ho sakate
 Similarly, both Jiva and Brahm are conscious
 kintu is sadharmy se donon ek nahin ho sakate
 Also, this philosophy considers the Vedas to be the ultimate proof of being divine
 is darshan ke rachayita maharishi kapil hai
 In this, nature has been considered as the causal cause of creation on the basis of hospitality
 iskaa pramukh siddhant he ki abhaav se bhav yaa asat se sat kii utpatti kadaapi sambhav nahin he
 Truth works can be generated only due to truth
 sankhya darshan prakruti se sristi rachana or sanhaar ke kram ko vishesh rup se maanata he
 Along with this, the ultimate subtle cause of nature and its 24 functional substances are described clearly
 purush 25 waan tatv mana gaya he, jo prakruti kaa vikaar nahin he
 Thus, nature is the cause of all activities, but there is no reason for nature, because it has eternal power
 purush chetan tatv he, to prakruti achetan
 Man is the bhakti of nature, while nature itself is not the bhokti
 is darshan ke rachayita maharishi patanjali hai
 In it, God, Jeevatma and Prakriti are clearly described
 iske alaava yoga kya he, jeev ke bandhan kaa kaaran kya he? chitt kii vrittiyaan koun si hai? iske niyantran ke kya upaay hai ityadi yogic kriyaaon kaa vistrut varnan kiya gaya he
 According to this theory, the meditation of God is internal
 jab tak hamaari indriyaan bahirgami hai, tab tak dhyaan kadaapi sambhav nahin he
 According to this, the praise and worship of God with other names is incomplete without chanting the main name of God O3M
 mimasaasutra is darshan kaa mul granth he jiske rachayita maharishi jaimini hai
 This philosophy describes the appropriation of mantras in Vedic yajnas and the procedures of yagyas
 yadi yoga darshan antahkaran shuddhi kaa upaay bataata he, to mimasaa darshan maanav ke paariwarik jivan se rashtriya jivan tak ke kartavyon or akartavyon kaa varnan karata he, jisase samast raashtra kii unnati ho sake
 Just as the entire ritual is based on the appropriation of mantras, the Mimamsa philosophy also supports the appropriation of mantras and its legislation
 dharm ke liye maharishi jaimini ne veda ko bhi param pramaan mana he
 According to him, the appropriation of mantras, shruti, sentence, case, place and Samakhya are considered as the fundamental basis in Yajna
 vedant kaa arth he vedon kaa antim siddhant
 The Brahmasutra composed by Maharishi Vyasa is the basic text of this philosophy
 is darshan ko uttar mimasaa bhi kehete hai
 According to this philosophy, being the doer-bearer and exterminator of the universe is the reason for the world
 upadan athwa abhinn kaaran nahin
 Brahma is omnipotent, omnipotent, blissful, eternal, eternal, eternal
 saath hi janm maran aadi cleshon se rahit or niraakaar bhi he
 It is clear from the first formula of this philosophy, that is, Brahma curiosity, that what one wants to know is different from Brahm, otherwise how can there be a desire to know oneself
 or yah sarvavidit he ki jeevatma hameshaa se hi apane dukhon se mukti kaa upaay karti rahi he
 But the quality of Brahma is different from this
 aage chalakar veydant ke anekanek sampradaay bane
 Apart from conspiracy philosophies, Lokayat and Shaiva and Shakta philosophy are also integral parts of Hindu philosophy
 vedavirohi hone ke kaaran naastik sampradaayon main charvak mat kaa bhi naam liya jaataa he
 Due to being materialistic, it could not get respect
 iskaa itihaas or sahitya bhi uplabdh nahin he
 Excerpts from a Charvaka text by the name of "jupiter Sutra" are found in other philosophy texts
 charvak mat ek prakaar kaa yatharthwaad or bhautikwaad he
 According to this, there is only direct evidence
 anumaan or aagam sandigdh hote hai
 Only the physical world dependent on direct is true
 aatma, ishwar, swarg aadi sab kalpit hai
 Consciousness arises in the body due to the combination of ghosts
 deh ke saath maran main uskaa ant ho jaataa he
 The soul is not eternal
 uskaa punarjanm nahin hota
 The goal of life should be to cultivate happiness as much as possible in a lifetime
 upanishdon ke aadhyatmavaad tathaa tapowad main hi vaidic karmkand ke viruddh ek prakat kranti kaa rup grahan kar liya
 In the Upanishad period, on the one hand, the non-vedic traditions of Buddhism and Jainism emerged and on the other, the emergence of Vedic philosophies
 isa ke janm ke purv or baad kii ek do shatabdiyon main anek darshanon kii samanaantar dharaayen bhartiya vichaarbhumi par pravaahit hone lageen
 They also include streams of Buddhist and Jain philosophies
 jain dharm kaa aarambh buddha dharm se pehle hua
 There were 23 Jain Tirthankaras before Mahavir Swami
 mahavir swami ne jain dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 Gautama Buddha, the originator of Buddhism, was his contemporary
 donon kaa samay i
pus
 chhathi shatabdi mana jaataa he
 He introduced a new religious tradition independent of the Vedas
 vedon ko na maanane ke kaaran jain or buddha darshanon ko "naastik darshan" bhi kehete hai
 Their original literature is in the form of the teachings of Mahavira and Buddha, which are found in the Prakrit and Pali lingua franca respectively and after the nirvana of these great men, the collection was done in consultation with their followers in many musicals
 buddha or mahavir donon himalay pradesh ke rajkumaar the
 He preached and preached his religions in his youth, taking renunciation
 unka yah sanyas upanishdon kii parampara se prerit he
 The glory of asceticism and renunciation in Jainism and Buddhism is also favorable to the philosophy of the Upanishads
 ahimsa or aachaar kii mahatta tathaa jatibhed kaa khandan in dharmon kii visheshta he
 The seeds of non-violence also exist in the Upanishads
 phir bhi ahimsa kii dhwaja ko dharm ke akaash main fahraane kaa shrey jain or buddha sampradaayon ko dena hoga
 The tradition of Jainism has continued from the teachings of Mahavir Swami till today
 mahavir swami ke upadesh 41 sutron main sankalit hai, jo jainagamon main milte hai
 Umaswati's "tattvaartadhigam Sutra" is an ancient and authentic scripture of Jain philosophy
 siddhsen divakar, haribhadra, merutung, aadi jain darshan ke prasiddh acharya hai
 In terms of theory, Jain philosophy is spiritualist on the one hand and materialistic on the other
 vah aatma or pudgal donon ko maanata he
 In Jainism, the soul is as broad and expanding as light
 punarjanm main naveen sharir ke anusaar aatma kaa sankoch or vistaar hota he
 By nature he is enlightened and blissful
 vah man or indriyon ke madhyam ke bina paroksh vishyon ke gyaan main samarth he
 There are three forms of this supernatural knowledge - periodology, mind: synonym and mere knowledge
 purna gyaan ko kevalgyaan kehete hai
 It is attained in the state of nirvana
 yah sab prakaar se vastuon ke samast dharmon kaa gyaan he
 This knowledge is "proof"
 kisi apeksha se vastu ke ek dharm kaa gyaan "nay" kehalaata he
 There are many types of "nay"
 gyaan kii saapekshata jain darshan kaa siddhant he
 This relativity makes generosity and tolerance possible in human thought
 sabhi vichaar or vishwaas aanshik satya ke adhikari ban jate hai
 The insistence of absolute truth is unreasonable
 vah nirvana main hi praapt ho saktaa he
 Nirvana is the Kaivalya of Atman
 karm ke prabhaav se pudgal kii gati aatma ke prakaash ko aachhadit karti he
 This is called "asrav"
 yahi aatma kaa bandhan he
 The inhibition of this motion from asceticism, renunciation and virtue is called "sanvar" and the loss of accumulated karmapudgal is called "nirjara"
 iskaa ant "nirvana" main hota he
 Infinite knowledge of soul and infinite bliss is illuminated in Nirvana
 buddha ke upadesh teen pitakon main sankalit hai
 These are called Sutta Pitaka, Vinay Pitaka and Abhidhamma Pitaka
 ye pitak buddha dharm ke aagam hai
 The notion of functional truth is a fundamental feature of Buddhism
 upanishdon kaa brahm achal or aparivartansheel he
 According to Buddha, change is the truth
 pashchimi darshan main hairaclitis or bergasaan ne bhi parivartan ko satya mana
 There is also no irreversible basis for this change
 bahya or aantarik jagat main koi dhruv satya nahin he
 External substances are the effects of "observations"
 aatma bhi manobhaavon or vigyaanon kii dhara he
 Thus "buddhism" is founded by denying the subjectivism of the Upanishads in Buddhism
 phir bhi baudhdhamat main karm or punarjanm maanya hai
 Buddhism is filled with compassion even if the soul is not respected
 du:kha se dravit hokar hi buddha ne sanyas liya or du:kha ke nirodh kaa upaay khoja
 Seeing the cause of grief in Avidya, Trishna, etc
, they told their annihilation to be the path of nirvana
 anaatmavaadi hone ke kaaran buddha dharm kaa vedant se virodh hua
 The result of this protest was that Buddhism had to be exiled from India
 kintu asia ke purvi deshon main uskaa prachaar hua
 Due to differences in the followers of the Buddha, many cults were formed
 siddhantbhed ke anusaar buddha parampara main chaar darshan prasiddh hai
 Among them, Vaibhashika and Sautrantika schools are in Hinayana tradition
 yah dakshini baudhdhamat hai
 Its promotion is also in Lanka
 yogachaar or madhyamik mat mahayan parampara main hai
 This is Northern Buddhism
 in chaaron darshanon kaa udai isa kii aarambhik shabtabdiyon main hua
 At the same time conspiracies arose in the Vedic tradition
 is prakaar bhartiya panrapara main darshan sampradaayon kaa aavirbhaav lagbhag ek hi saath hua he tathaa unka vikaas paraspar virodh ke dwaara hua he
 Like the western philosophies, these philosophies have not emerged in the preceding order
 vasubandhu, kumarlaat maitrey or nagarjun in darshanon ke pramukh acharya the
 Vaibhashikism considers external objects as their power and self-evident
 at: use bahya pratyakshvaad athwa "sarvastitvvaad" kehete hai
 According to the doctrinal theory, substances are not direct, but inferred
 at: use bahyanumeyavaad kehete hai
 According to Yogachara opinion, there is no power of external substances
 hame jo kuch dikhaai detaa he vah vigyaan maatr he
 Yogachara Mat is called science
 madhyamik mat ke anusaar vigyaan bhi satya nahin he
 Everything is zero
 shunya kaa arth nirswabhaav, ni:swaroop athwa anirvachaneey he
 This void of nihilism comes very close to the Brahman of Vedanta
 arthshaastra bhartiya raajnneetik darshan ko pratipaadit karne vaale pramukh aadi granthon main se ek he
 Its creator is considered Chanakya
 anuvanshiki jeev vigyaan kii vah shakha he jiske antargat anuvanshikta tathaa jeevon kii vibhinnataaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The fundamental achievements of Gregor John Mendel in the study of heredity have now been incorporated into genetics
 prayek sajiv praani kaa nirmaan mul rup se koshikaon dwaara hi hua hota he
 Some chromosomes are found in these cells
 inaki sankhya prayek jati main nishchit hoti he
 Inside these chromosomes, like DNA beads, some DNA chemical units are known as genes
 ye jin gunasutra ke lakshanon athwa gunon ke prakat hone, kaary karne or arjeet karne ke liye jimmevaar hote hai
 The basic purpose of this science is to study the ways of heredity, that is, how a child resembles or differs from its parents
 samast jeev, chaahe ve jantu hon yaa vanaspati, apane purvajon ke yatharth praturup hote hai
 In scientific language, it is called the principle of 'origin of equal
' anuvanshiki ke antargat katipay karkon kaa vishesh rup se adhyayan kiya jaataa haih The first factor is heredity
 kisi jeev kii anuvanshikta uske janakon kii janankoshikaon dwaara praapt rasinic suchnaayen hoti hai
 For example, how a creature will grow will determine its heredity
 doosraa kaarak vibhed he jise ham kisi praani tathaa uski santan main pate yaa paa sakate hai
 Almost all creatures display signs of their parents or sometimes of Baba, Dadi or their previous generation
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki uske kuch lakshan sarvatha naveen hon
 This type of changes or differences has many causes
 jeevon kaa parivardhan tathaa uske baad kaa jivan unke parivesh par bhi nirbhar karata he
 The surroundings of beings are extremely complex; Under this, all the substances, forces and other living beings of the organism are contained, which continue to affect their life
 vaigyanik in samast karkon kaa samyak adhyayan karata he, ek vaakya main ham yah kah sakate hai ki anuvanshiki vah vigyaan he, jiske antargat anuvanshkita ke kaaran jeevon tathaa unke purvajon main samanta tathaa vibhedon, unki utpatti ke kaarnon or viksit hone kii sambhaavnaaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In 1911, Johansen established a distinction between the external characteristics of animals and the pituitary traits
 jeevon ke bahm lakshan unke parivardhan ke saath-saath parivartit hote rahete hai, jaise jeevon kii bhrunavastha, shishav, yauvan tathaa vriddhavastha main paryaapt shaareerik vibhed drushtigochar hota he
 In contrast, their ancestral traits or characteristics are stable and unchangeable
 kisi bhi jeev ke pitraagat lakshan or parivesh kii antakriyaaon ke falswaroop uski vruddhi or parivardhan hota he
 Therefore, the putative traits determine the 'norms of response' of organisms, that is, the manner of their response to the environment
 is prakaar kii pratikriyaaon se jeevon ke bahya lakshan kaa nirmaan hota he
 The genetic element is used in agricultural science in crop size, production, disease prevention and breed improvement of domestic animals etc
 anuvanshik tatwon kii sahaayta se udvikas, bhrauniki tathaa anya sambhddha vigyaanon ke adhyayan main suvidha hoti hai
 This science has solved many illusions related to symptoms and diseases
 judwaan santanon kii utpatt or susantatishaastra kii anek samasyaon par is vigyaan ne prakaash daalaa he
 Similarly, human society has benefited from many important achievements of population-genetic element

 He also stated that within the chromosomes, these genes are arranged in a defined sequence, due to which it is possible to make a genetic picture of them
 in logon ne kadli makkhi, drosophila, ke jin ke anek chitra banaae

 Many scientists believe that genetic study of humans is not a simple task
 iskaa kaaran yah batalaaya jaataa he ki manushya kii santan ke janm main lagbhag 10 maas lag jate hai or ise purna vayask hone main kam se kam 20 varsh lagate hai
 Therefore, genetic study of humans is complicated due to the time it takes 20,22 years to study only one generation

 In the absence of all things in the dream, different types of things appear

 But in a daydream, a person with a certain type of experience knows that he is experiencing something of the sort

 During an experiment, some scientists also believed that this is possible but when they identify themselves in the dream then it would be very difficult to come out of that dream and this increases the chances of a person with weak mind to go into a coma
 Being with a person is nothing short of a miracle
 swapn kii ghatnaayen vartmaan kaal se sambandh rakhti hai

 Therefore, dream experiences are explained on the basis of waking state
 isi prakaar swapn anubhavon ke aadhaar par jaagratavastha ke anubhavon ko bhi samajhaayaa jaataa he
 a dream is a form of human memories, feelings, fantasies, thoughts, thoughts, desires and the greatest of all is his fear
 swapnon kaa adhyayan manovigyaan ke liye ek nayaa vishay he
 Ordinarily, the experience of the dream is such an experience which according to our general logic seems utterly meaningless
 atev saadhaarant: manavaigyanik swapn ke vishay main charchaa karanevaalon ko nikamma vyakti maanate hai
 In ancient times, ordinary illiterate people used to discuss dreams because they thought that they could predict future events through dreams
 yah vishwaas saamaanya janata main aaj bhi he
 Modern scientific thinking considers this type of belief to be baseless and considers it to be superstition
 swapnon ke vaigyanik adhyayan dwaara yah jaanane kii cheshtaa kii gai he ki bahari uttejnaaon ke prabhaav se kis prakaar ke swapn ho sakate hai
 By putting cold water on a sleeping person's feet, he often dreams of walking in the river

 Different types of effects on the body produce different types of dreams
 swapnon kaa adhyayan chikitsa drushti se bhi kiya gaya he
 Usually, in the heightened stage of the disease, the patient sees terrible dreams and when he starts getting better, he sees benign scenes in dreams
 swapnon ke adhyayan ke liye manovaigyanik kabhi-kabhi sammohan kaa prayog karte hai
 When the patient is put to sleep by giving special type of hypnosis, then he sees dreams according to those hypnosis
 kuch manovaigyanik sote samay rogi ko swapnon ko yaad rakhane kaa nirdesh de dete hai
 Then the patient does not forget his dreams
 maansik rogi ko prarambh main swapn yaad hi nahin rahete
 By dreaming such a patient, his dreams can be recalled
 saadhaarant: ham swapnon main unheen baton ko dekhte hai jinke sanskaar hamaare mastishk par ban jate hai
 We often see that our dreams have no relation with the waking state
 kabhi kabhi ham swapn ke un bhaagon ko bhul jate hai jo hamaare jivan ke liye vishesh arth rakhte hai
 Skilled psychologists achieve such dreams through hypnosis
 dekha gaya he ki jin swapnon ko manushya bhul jaataa he ve uske jivan kii aisi baton ko chetana ke samaksh laate hai jo use atyant apriy hoti hai or jinka bhul janaa hi uske liye shreyaskar hota he
 Such things can be reminded to a person by special type of hypnosis
 in swapnon kaa maansik chikitsa main vishesh mahatv rahata he
 According to Indian astrology, the dream is determined according to the time and place in which the dream is seen
 swapn ke vishay main sabase mahatv kii khojein doctor sigmund frid ne kii hai
 He determined from his study that to know the inner mind of man it is absolutely necessary to know his dreams
 "interpritesan ov drims ov drims" naamak apane granth main inhone yah bataane kii cheshtaa kii he ki jin swapnon ko ham nirarthak samajhate hai unke vishesh arth hote hai
 They have tried to explain the meaning of the signs of dreams and to clarify their composition
 inke kathananusaar swapn hamaari un ichchhaaon ko saamaanya rup se athwa pratik rup se vyakt karata he jisaki tripti jaagrath avasthaa main nahin hoti
 When the child does not express his desire to buy sweets and toys for fear of the scolding of the father, his repressed desire attains fulfillment through dreams
 jaise jaise manushya kii umr badhati jaat he uskaa samaaj kaa bhay jatil hota jaataa he
 Because of this fear, he not only tries to hide his unreasonable desires from others but he also hides from himself
 doctor frid ke anusaar manushya ke man ke teen bhaag hai
 The first part is the one in which all desires come and find their fulfillment
 inaki tripti ke liye manushya ko apni ichhashakti se kaam lenaa padataa he
 This part of the mind is called the conscious mind
 yah bhaag bahari jagat se vyakti kaa samanvay sthapit karata he
 The second part of the human mind is called the unconscious mind
 yah bhaag uski sabhi prakaar kii bhogechhaon kaa aashray he
 In this, all his repressed desires remain
 uske man kaa teesraa bhaag avchetan man kehalaata he
 In this part, man's moral self remains
 doctor frid ne naitik swatv ko rajya ke censor vibhaag kii upama di he
 Just as the state's censor department investigates any new news before it is published
 usee prakaar manushya ke avchetan man main upasthit censor arthath naitik swatv kisi bhi vaasana ke swapnchetana main prakashit hone ke purv kaant chhant kar detaa he
 After having a very unpleasant or immoral dream, a person has self-immolation
 swapndrashtaa ko is aatmabhatrsana se bachaane ke liye uske man kaa censor vibhaag swapnon main anek prakaar kii todmarod karke dabi ichha ko prakashit karata he
 Then upon awakening, this sensor makes us forget that part of the dream
 jisase aatmabhatrsana ho
 That is why we forget all the dreams
 dow frid ne swapnon ke pratikon ke vishesh prakaar ke arth bataaen hai
 Most of these symbols are genitals related
 unke kathananusaar swapn main honevaali bahut si nirarthak kriyaayein ratikriya kii bodhak hoti hai
 His statement is that man's main desire is sex
 isi se use adhik se adhik shaareerik sukh miltaa he or isi kaa uske jivan main sarvaadhik rup se daman bhi hota he
 Most of our repressed desires are secretly illuminated by various symbols in the dream
 sabase adhik dayit honevaali ichha kamechha he
 Therefore our greater dreams belong to the same
 maansik rogiyon ke vishay main dekha gaya he ki ek ore uski prabal kamechha damit avasthaa main rahati he or duusari ore uski upasthiti sweekaar karnaa unke liye kathin hota he
 That is why the dreams of mental patients are not only complicated but they also forget
 doctor frid ne swapnrachana ke paanch-saat prakaar bataae hai
 Principal among them are summarization, expansion, transposition and dramatization
 sankshepan ke anusaar koi bahut bada prasang chota kar diya jaataa he
 This is exactly the opposite in expansion
 isamen swapnchetana ek thode se anubhav ko lambey swapn main vyakt karti he
 Suppose someone insulted us in a party and we want to avenge it
 parantu hamaara naitik swapn iskaa virdohi he, to ham apane swapn main dekhenge ki jis vyakti ne hamaara apmaan kiya he vah anek prakaar durghatnaon main padaa hua he
 We want to help him, but circumstances are such that we are unable to help him
 bhavantareekaran kii avasthaa main ham apane aniatik bhav ko aise vyakti ke prati prakashit hote nahin dekhte jiske prati un bhaavon kaa prakaashan hona aatmaglani paidaa karata he
 Sometimes teenage boys have terrible dreams
 unamem ve kisi rakshas se ladate hue apane ko pate hai
 Psychoanalysis suggests that this demon remains his father, uncle, elder brother, teacher or a disciplinarian
 naatakeekaran ke anusaar jab koi vichaar ichha athwa swapn main prakashit hota he to vah adhiktar drushti pratimaaon kaa sahaara letaa he
 Dreaming shows many poignant things by portraying an entire situation
 swapn kisi shiksha ko sidhe rup se nahin detaa
 It is not possible to immediately convey the meaning that is expressed through many pictures and events in a dream
 maan lijie, ham akele main hai or hamen dar lagata he ki hamaare upar koi akraman na kar kar de
 This small gesture produces many dreams
 ham aisi paristhiti main pad jate hai jahaan ham apane ko surakshit samajhate hai parantu hamen baad ko baari dhokhaa hota he
 Dr
 Freud states that dreams have two forms - one published and the other unpublished
 jo swapn hamen yaad aata he vah prakashit rup he
 This form comes to our consciousness with many of the above-mentioned break-up compositions and symbols
 swapn kaa vaastavik rup yah he jise gudh manovaigyanik khoj ke dwaara praapt kiya jaataa he
 The meaning that dreams impose by ordinary people is far from its true meaning
 yah vaastavik arth swapnnirmaan kala ke jane bina nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Freud has mentioned the following about importance of dreaming: The dream is the result of mental regression
 yah pratigaman thode kaal ke liye rahata he
 Therefore, it does not harm the mental development of a person
 duusare yah pratigaman abhinay ke rup main hota he
 For this reason, it causes catharsis of human desires which are of childhood stage
 yadi aise swapn manushya ko na hon to uskaa maansik vikaas ruk jaae athwa use kisi na kisi prakaar kaa maansik rog ho jaae
 Dr
 Freud has said the second important thing that the dream is not destroyer of sleep but its protector
 bhayanak athwa uttejk swapnon se damit uttejnaa baahar aakar shant ho jaati he
 a dream is a way to solve complex problems of human hearing
 frid ne teesri baat yah bataai ki swapn na to vyarth maansik anubhav he or na usamen dekhe gaye drishy nirarthak hote hai
 a person's mental health is protected by unpleasant dreams
 swapnon kaa adhyayan karnaa man ke aantarik rup ko samajhane ke liye nitant aavashyak he
 Dr
 Freud has called dreams the key to the inner mind of man
 swapn sambandhi baatcheet se rogi ke bahut se damit bhav chetana kii sataha par aate hai or is tarah unka rechan ho jaataa he
 Listening to many dreams of a patient and applying their meaning , the disease of the patient is destroyed

 As the emotional unity of the patient and the physician is established, the dreams start getting more and more and more clear
 ek hi swapn kai prakaar se hota he
 The sense of dream comes to the doctor through many types of dreams
 charles yung ne swapn ke vishay main kuch baaten doctor frid se bhinn kahi hai
 According to his statement, dream symbols do not have the same meaning at all times
 swapnon ke vaastavik arth jaanane ke liye swapndrashtaa ke vyaktitv ko jaananaa, uski vishesh samasyaon ko samajhnaa or us samay desh, kaal or paristhitiyon ko dhyaan main rakhana nitant aavashyak he
 The same dream has different meanings for different dreamers and it has different meanings for different circumstances even for the same dreamer
 atev jab tak swayan swapndrashtaa kisi arth ko sweekaar na kar le tab tak hamen yah nahin jaananaa chahie ki swapn kaa vaastavik arth praapt hoga
 According to the belief of Dr
 Freud, more dreams are related to our lust
 yung ke kathananusaar swapnon kaa kaaran manushya ke keval vaiyaktik anubhav athwa uski swaarthmayi ichchhaaon kaa hi daman maatr nahin hota varan uske gambhirtam man kii aadhyatmik anubhutiyaan bhi hoti hai
 Due to this, a person gets lifelong education through his dreams
 charles yung ke matanusaar swapn keval puraane anubhavon kii pratikriya maatr nahin hai varan ve manushya ke bhavi jivan se sambandh rakhte hai
 Dr
 Freud tries to understand all the reactions of the human mind according to the normal natural inertial causal system
 inke pratikul doctor yung maansik pratikriyaaon ko mukhyat: lakshyapurna siddh karte hai
 The scientific system which is suitable for understanding the behavior of root substances, the same system cannot be used to explain conscious actions
 chetana ke sabhi kaary lakshyapurna hote hai
 a dream is also a similar goal, which aims to make the patient's future life sick or successful
 yung ke kathananusaar manushya swapn dwaara aisi baaten jaan saktaa he jinke anusaar chalane se vah apane aapako anek prakaar kii durghatnaon or du:khon se bachaa saktaa he
 He has explained this fact through several examples

 Sometimes some short-term dreams are remembered
 shruti main swapn ke vishay main jagah jagah charchaa huyi he
 In the Vrhadaranyaka Upanishad there is a theme about the dream, just as a king travels the country with his servants and subjects, similarly the creature wanders into his body at will, taking life, words, speech, etc
 in his life
 vrihadaaranyak upanishad main varnan he swapnavastha main jeev lok–paralok donon dekhtaa he or dukh sukh donon kaa anubhav karata he
 By stunning this gross body, the creature creates a sensuous body and then the world sees the other world

 vriksh, mel, mutr, stri, purush, sex, krodh, bhay aadi naanaa prakaar ke sansar kii rachana kar letaa he
 Even in the dream by the creature, the creation of earthly things is created
 yah rachana atyant rahasyamay or ati vicitra hoti he
 In the Mandukyopanishad, the dream is explained in a deep way
 swapn bhaanti sam vyaapt jag gyaan brahm par brahm saat ang unniis mukh taijas doosar paad
 Special - Seven parts are seven worlds
 muladhar, swaadhishthan, manipur, anahath, vishuddh, ajna, sahatradhar chakra
 unniis mukh paanch karmendriyaan, paanch gyanendriyaan
paanch praan- praan, apan, samaan,’vyaan, udaan tathaa man, buddhi, chitt, ahankaar
 The second and best type of shape is the common sense dream
 swapn main jeevatma apni sabhi oopaadhiyon ke samooh saath ek hota he, is samay antajkaran tejomay hone ke kaaran is avasthaa main aatma ko taijas kaha he
 Taizas is the third stage from the top to the bottom of the Brahman
 swapnavastha main donon jeevatma or aatma kaa taijas swaroop manovriti se shabd sparsh rup ras gandh kaa anubhav karte hai
 Taizus is the consumer of subtle subjects
 jeevatma or aatma kaa taijas swaroop donon abhed hai jaise jal kii boond main or jalashay main padane vaala akaash kaa prativimb
kathopanishad kahata he- ‘ya esh supteshu jagarti kaaman kaaman purusho nirmimanh’ yah purush jo naanaa bhogon kii rachana karata he sabake so jane par swayan jaagta he
 Here the man is told to be the creator of wishes
 atah siddh he swapn main bhi sristi hoti he,kya swapn main hui sristi vaastavik he
 -no instantaneously, the existence of the creation in the dream does not show any existence, but i have a definite view in this matter that whatever is seen in the dream is sure to be in some form or another in the form of some living organism or matter
 
 swapn or sristi ke vikaas kaa gaharaa sambandh he swapn he to sristi he or sristi he to swapn hai
 Auspicious and Inauspicious Results of Shruti - Shruti is of the opinion that dreams are indicative of auspicious and inauspicious results in future

 Dreaming and Sleep
 Sleep is the state when there is no dream
 The Question Question Council states that when the CNS is fully empowered by Udaan Vayu, then there is a state of sleep

 According to some scholars, 'accounting' is used in a wide sense
 iske teen ang ho sakate he : The process of writing transactions, ie the business part which can be called bookkeeping
 rachanaatmak kaary ko prakriya arthath saiddhanthik bhaag jise lekhankan kaha ja saktaa he
 The process of critical work, that is, the critical part, can be called audit
 pehle pustapaalan tathaa lekhankan ke kaaryon main vishesh antar nahin mana jaataa tha
 But in today's industrial age, both bookkeeping and accounting have become separate tasks
 saadharantah agralikhit kaary pustapaalan, lekhankan tathaa ankekshan teenon ke kshetra main aa jate hai : Bookkeeping - As is clear from the above point, bookkeeping is the art of accounting of business deals in journal and ledger
 hisaab-kitaab rakhane kii saadhaaran yogyata vaala koi bhi vyakti is kaary ko suvidha ke saath kar saktaa he
 This task is just to write mechanically
 lekhankan- uparyukt bindu ke anusaar lekhapal kaa kaary pustapalak ke kaary ke baad se prarambh hota he
 For this reason, it is said that accounting begins from where bookkeeping ends
 iske kshetra main shesh nikaalane se lekar antim khate taiyaar karne tathaa aavashyak bhul-sudhaar evam samaayojan karne ke kaary bhi aa jate he
 In short, work is the process of summarizing and analyzing
 saransh arthath talapat or phir iske vishleshan antim khate taiyaar karke kiya jaataa he
 The accountant is a well-educated person who is also clever in the work of bookkeeping
 uskaa kaary antim khate banaakar tarkpurna adhyayan karnaa hai
 According to various authors the definitions of audit are as follows: 1
 epa aar em di paula- ankekshan kaa arth chittha tathaa laabh-haani khate or unase sambandhit pustakon, khaaton tathaa pramankon kii jaanch karne se he taaki ankekshak apane aapako santusht kar sake or eemaandaaree se yah report de sake ki chittha niyamanusaar banaaya gaya he or vyapaar kii sahi tathaa thik sthiti ko prakat karata he jaisaa ki soochnaaon, spashtikarnon evam pustakon ke aadhaar par dekha gaya he jo use mili hai

 Montgomery - Auditing is the systematic examination of the books of an institution and the articles of deal so that the audit can verify the economic practices of the business and give its report regarding its results
 3
 larence aar dixi- ankekshan hisaab-kitaab ke lekhon kii jaanch he taaki yah spasht ho sake ki ve purnatah evam sahi rup se sambandhit saudon ke liye kiye gayi hai
 Also, it can be ensured that all the deals have been done officially

 Spicer and Pagler- "an audit of a number of books, accounts and certifiers of a business institution is called an audit, on the basis of which the auditor can say satisfactorily, based on the explanations and information received by him and which is revealed in the books
" According to him, the letter of the institution shows its 'financial condition' and the profit and loss account of the institution's profit and loss in true and true form
 yadi nahin to kin-kin baton se vah asantusht he or kyon
 ' 5
 josef lankaster- jaanch, pramann va satyaapan kii aisi prakriya ankekshan kehalaati he jiske dwaara chitthey kii shuddhta kaa pataa chalata he
 Thus, it can be conveniently said that there is a research of audit forms, certifiers and books of accounts from which books are written, in respect of the audit sheets and other prospectus which are made from these books, its report Give it to those who have appointed him to report
 ' 6
 Arthur W
 Holmes -
 'the audit is a scientific and systematic examination of the articles, certifiers, legal documents and other details of a public or private institution, whose purpose: 7
 ronaald e iris- 'vartmaan rup main ankekshan pustakon, pramankon evam anya aarthik va kanoonee lekhon kii niyamit or vaigyanik jaanch he, jisase vaastaviktaaon kaa sampaadan kiya ja sake tathaa laabh-haani khate se prakat shuddh aay or chitthey se prakat hone vaali aarthik sthiti ke sambandh main report di ja sake

 The purpose of this investigation is to find out whether the letter and profit-loss account of the organization created for a certain time reveals its true and correct position
 ' 9
 AW Hanson - Auditing of such articles is called auditing so that they can be believed and the details given by them can also be believed
 uparokt paribhaashaon ke aadhaar par nishkarsh rup me- Auditing is the specific and discreet examination of the books of account of a business organization, which is done by a qualified and impartial person with the help of certifiers, forms, information and explanations received from the institution, so that the auditor remains for a fixed time
 In relation to the accounting, we can report that, sanstha- ankekshan kisi bhi sanstha ke hisaab-kitaab kaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Independent person - The audit work should be done by someone who does not have any connection with the business or institution
 tabhi nishpaksh jaanch sambhav he
 Hence presently Chartered Accountants have been appointed
 jaanch kaa swaroop- ankekshan dwaara kii gayi jaanch sirf ganit se sambandhit shuddhta ko hi prakat nahin karti balki yah ek budhimattapurna nishpaksh jaanch he jo hisaab kii purna shuddhta darshaati he
 Accounting books - Auditing involves checking the books of account
 ankekshak ko apana kaaryakshetra sirf pustakon tak hi simit nahin karnaa hota he balki anya vaidhanik pustaken tathaa vibhinn tathyon kii jaankaree bhi kerani hoti hai
 Authenticators and Forms - Audit books are checked on the basis of certifiers and forms, if they are not available, they are confirmed by copies
 soochna evam spashtikaran- jaanch kaa aadhaar pramank hi hote hai phir bhi ankekshak yaaden pramank se santusht nahin he to len-denon kaa satyaapan karne ke liye suchnaayen tathaa spashtikaran maang saktaa he
 Intelligence - The work of investigation by audit is very important, so in this work intelligence and cleverness are required which is gained from the experience of this work
 jaanch kaa uddeshy- lekha-pustakon kii jaanch kaa uddeshy ek nishchit avadhi main banaaye gayi laabh-haani khate ke parinaamon ko evam ek nishchit tithi ko chitthey main darshaye gayi sampatti evam dayitvon kaa satyaapan karnaa he tathaa santushti par pramaan-patr dena hota he
 In fact, the auditor has to express his opinion on the examination of the final accounts
 niyamaanukoolta- bhartiya company adhinium, 1956 ke antargat company kaa chittha va laabh-haani khaataa banaate samay bhi kuch mahatvapurn niyamon ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 Therefore, the company auditor has to write in his report whether the letter is the norm or not
 avadhi- ankekshan saadharantah ek vittiya varsh yaa ek lekha varsh ke lekhon kaa kiya jaataa he
 If the accounts of more than one year are audited, this investigation is called research
 parinaam- lekhon kii jaanch ke baad isaki satyata va auchity ke vishay main report deni hoti he
 If the auditor is dissatisfied with anything, it clearly describes it in his report
 lekhankan anivaaryta ke rup main vyaavhaarik rup main lekhankan kaa sambandh vyavsaay ko jivit rakhane ke liye tathaa samaaj main pratishtha praapt karne hetu anivaary hai
 The following arguments can be given for this: aaj ke yug main kisi vyavsaay se hone vaale laabh athwa haani kaa sahi-sahi gyaan bina lekhankan ke sammav nahin he
 If the financial condition of the businessman is strong and the financial resources are very good, then the sale is more as a result of selling cheaper than other businessman, but only after the bankruptcy, he will know that he has sold the item for less than the cost
 vyavsaay main len-dein adhik hote hai visheshtah jahaan udhaar par maal adhik bechaa jaataa he vahaan dendaaron ke naam yaad rakhana sambhav nahin he at: lekhankan anivaary hai
 Profit or loss at the end of a certain period
 iske liye lekhankan anivaary he
 If the professional accounting books are maintained properly, then the current year's income-expenditure or profit-loss can be compared to the profit-loss of previous years
 lekhankan ke madhyam se vyapaaree ko apni vittiya sthiti kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Articles have great importance in assessment
 yadi lekhe niyamanusaar rakhe hon to yah bahut hi sahaayak siddh hote hai
 The total amount of money that a trader has to pay to a person can be obtained only from accounting
 alaabhprad kriyaaon ko chhodkar laabhprad kriyaayein prarambh karke adhik laabh kamaaya ja saktaa he tathaa yadi kaaryakshmata main kami he to unke kaarnon ko jaanakar unhen dur kiya ja saktaa he
 This work is possible only through accounting
 kisi vyavsaay main yadi uchit rup se lekha-pustaken rakhi jaati hai to us vyavsaay kii pratishtha badhati he
 Accounting also has the following benefits: lekhakarm vilasita ke rup main It is considered a luxury for small traders as they have limited requirements but at the present time it does not seem completely appropriate
 ankekshan vilasita ke rup main Still have to be used to hide the deceit in the accounts, which the auditor cannot catch despite proper cleverness and caution
 at: ankekshan nirarthak he
 On the basis of the above facts, we can say that audit is luxury in small business but it would be wrong for all businesses to call audit as luxury
 choti sansthaaon ke jahaan ek-do karmchaaree hai tathaa lekhakarm kaa kaary swami ekaaki vyapaaree yaa saajhedaar hi dekhte he at: ankekshan aavashyak nahin hai, lekin bade vyavsaay main yah laabhprad evam atyadhik aavashyak he, vilasita nahin
 No luxury of audit karmchaariyon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- ankekshan karwaane ke falswaroop karmchaaree kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi hoti he kyonki ve jaanate hai ki kaary thik se na karne par ankekshak dwaara truti pakadi ja sakati he ! Increased efficiency of employees - As a result of efficient audit, employees become efficient in their work because the auditor keeps on reporting and deficiencies in his report from time to time and also during the audit
 prabandhakon kii kaaryakshmata main vruddhi- jab prabandhakon ko yah maaloom rahata he ki unke dwaara kiye gayi kaary par ankekshak apni report prastut karegaa jo ki sarvamaanya hogi to ve apana kaary purna eemaandaaree se karenge
 Assistants in the development of business - everyone believes in audited accounts and this increases the fame of business and provides facilities to the business from all sides which leads to the development of business
 diwalia hone kii dasha main nirnay sambhav- yadi lekha-pustaken thik prakaar rakhkar ankekshan karvaa rakhaa he to nyaayalay dwaara rin mukti aadesh praapt karne main sahaayak siddh hote hai
 In the absence of this, it may take longer
 bhavi yojana banane main sahaayak- prabandhak kai varshon ke antim khaaton ke aadhaar par tulanaatmak adhyayan karte hai tathaa yah dekhte he ki kaaryakshmata kis prakaar badhaayi ja sakati he
 Increase in plant and machine efficiency - The audit of cost accounts shows how much functionality the machines have and for what reasons the full functionality of the machines is not being used
 in kaarnon kii jaankaree praapt karkekaryakshmata ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Inevitability of audit ankekshan se kaaryakshmata par prabhaav padataa hai at: ise vilasita nahin kaha ja saktaa hai
 In the following situations it is mandatory - is prakaar yah kahana purnroop se satya na hoga ki lekhankan anivaary he or ankekshan vilasita hai
 Accounting is also a luxury in small businesses, while it is compulsory for large businesses
 kintu phir bhi lekhankan va ankekshan ek sikke ke do pahalu hai
 If there is no accounting, then whose audit will be done
 or lekhankan sirf akelaa ho to uski satyata kii vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 Making errors is a part of human nature, the main purpose of audit is to detect and prevent inaccuracy and embezzlement
 ankekshak trutiyon kaa pataa lagane hetu praarambhik lekhon kii jaanch, jarnal kii jaanch, rocked shesh kii jaanch, khaaton ke sheshon kii jaanch, sahaayak bahiyon kii khatauni kii jaanch, gat varsh ke talapat se milan, antar kii raashi kaa pataa lagaana, talapat ke jod kii jaanch aadi kriya apana saktaa hai
 If the auditor used so much care, skill and intelligence in his work as was the case in those circumstances and he had done his utmost, which was absolutely necessary to find the errors
 yadi phir bhi kapat kaa pataa lagane main asamarth rahaa ho to ankekshak ko uttaradaayi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa hai
 Auditing work never means that the auditor has insured the inaccuracies and embezzlement, nor does he guarantee that all the impurities and embezzlement will be found
 usase sirf yah apeksha kii jaati he ki vah apana kaary uchit saavdhaanee evam chaturaai se karegaa
