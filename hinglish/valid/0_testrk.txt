 saanchaa:nav yug andolansaanchaa:harith raajnneetisaanchaa:udaarvaad Mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas was a renowned sociologist of India
 unhone dakshin bharat main jati tathaa jati pratha, saamaajik starikaran, saanskritikaran tathaa pashchimikaran par kaary kiya
 They presented the concept of 'dominant caste'
 'mysore narsinhachaar shrinivas' ko san 1977 main bharat sarkaar dwaara vigyaan evam abhiyantriki ke kshetra main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 They are from Karnataka
 aupchaarik rup se bhartiya samajashaastra ke aadi-purush bhale hi na hon, lekin swatantra bharat main is anushaasan ko unhone apane saidhantik yogadan, jati kii vilakshan samaj or sahabhaagi prekshan kii paddati ke istemaal se jitna samrudh kiya he vah unhen desh ke shirshatam samaaj-vigyaniyon main shaamil karne ke liye paryaapt he
 In sociology, he is known for his original foundations like Sanskritisation, dominant caste and vote bank
 shrinivas sansthaaon ke nirmaataa bhi the
 He is credited for the establishment of departments of sociology in Baroda and Delhi University
 shodh or adhyayan ke ucchstareey sansthaanon kii sthapana or disha-nirdesan ke lihaaz se bhi bhartiya samajashaastra ke vikaas main unka yogadan kaaljayi mana jayega
 Apart from a specific study of rural community and caste structure, M
N
 Srinivas has also done thought provoking work on topics such as social impact of science, Gandhi's religious thinking, history of anthropology and gender
 shrinivas kaa krititv vastunishth paryvekshan, vishleshan kii maheentaon tathaa saidhantik gaharaai kaa durlabh sangam mana jaataa he
 His writing provides a particular ground context for inter-subjectivity
 shrinivas kii samajashastreey drushti ghatnaon kii bahari banaavat ko bhed kar unhen gadhane vaali sanrachanaon or aitihaasik shaktiyon kii thaah leti he
 His ability to present the nuanced details and insights of community life in simple language gives him a distinct personality from contemporary sociologists
 is arth main ve vishaygat shabdaawalee kaa atikaraman karte hue saadhaaran or prachlit bhashaa ko chunate hai
 It will be called the democracies of his scholarship that his theoretical concepts help in understanding the subject rather than engaging in his own ideas
 shrinivas ne vicharadhara ke str par bhartiya samajashaastra ke liye ek nayi zamin taiyaar kii
 It is worth mentioning that at the time when Srinivas was preparing to study Indian society, American and British academic installations dominated social sciences
 america vishvavidhyalayon main prachlit drushtikon bhartiya upmahadweep ke samaaj ko samajhane ke liye sanskritnishtha paramparaon par jor detaa tha
 As a result, Indian sociologists considered Sanskrit sources and Indology / Indology to be more authentic for the study of contemporary reality
 shrinivas pehle samajashastri the jinhone is varchasvkaari sthiti ko chunauti di
 He proved from his writings that in sociology, the study of the actual activities and activities of society is better than relying on classical references
 shrinivas dwaara prastut prabhutvshaalee jati tathaa samskruthikaran kii avadharanaon kaa raajnneeti vigyaniyon ke alaava itihaas-lekhan kii sabaltern jaisi dhaaraon ke itihaaskaaron ne vyapak prayog kiya gaya he
 In this sense, his work can be placed in the category of an intellectual tradition which has acquired the status of an important reference for new and old scholars
 prasangvash, prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana sankhya bal, bhu-swaamitv, shiksha or naukari jaise karkon ke kaaran kisi jati ke gaanv yaa kshetra vishesh main dabadabe ko jaahir karti he to samskruthikaran nimna jatiyon dwaara ucch jatiyon khaas taur par brahman varg kii samskruti, reeti-rivaazon, bhashaa or veshbhusha aadi ko apnaane kii pravriti ko gyaapit karti he
 Though his third concept vote bank could not make a permanent place in social sciences, the term is used indiscriminately in the daily discourse of politics and media world
 swatantra bharat kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sanrachana ke adhyayan main ye teenon avadharanaayen or usase jude vimarsh tattvik mahatva hasil kar chuke hai
 The concepts of dominant caste and culturalization help in understanding the decisive elements of India's social system and its organizational structure
 haalaanki brahmnavaadi aadarshon kii ghatati vaidhata ke kaaran samskruthikaran kii avadharana ab utani mahatvapurn nahin maani jaati lekin yah tathy he ki beesvin sadi ke ek bade kalkhand or swatantraaa ke baad bhi lambe samay tak samskruthikaran ek kaasi ullekhneey pravriti thi
 In the politics that emerged after the Dalit movement and the Mandal Commission, the trend of Sanskritisation has weakened, but the concept of dominant caste is still seen as an essential tool in analyzing the political processes in rural society in India
 kai samakaleen samajashastri shrinivas ke krititv ko rashtravaadi samajashaastra ke brihattar sandarbh main rakhkar aankane kaa aagrah karte rahe hai
 He says that the urban elite of independent India wanted to continue the project of modernization of colonial rule
 isliye rashtravaadi samajashastriyon ke krititv main chintan or vichaar kii vahi aupniveshik saraniyan sakriy thi jinke aadhaar par british satta apane shashan ko vaid tehraati aayi thi
 These scholars say that the work of sociologists like Srinivas focused on caste and community provides a benchmark for understanding of an all-india Sanskritist Hinduism
 lekin shrinivas kii drushti ko prakat yaa aprakat taur par british yaa america maanavshaastra kii sthapanaaon se nirdeshit bataanaa jaldbaaji kii daleel he jo subooton kii kami ke baavjood aarope patr taiyaar karne kii himakat karti he
 This argument fails to target the tendency of Srinivasa's work in which Srinivas studies the community and also considers the duality of the community and its relations
 shrinivas samajashaastra or maanavshaastra kii buniyadi prasthaapanaaon par bhi thik isi tarah vichaar karte hai
 It is worth noting that Srinivas defines himself as a fellow scholar, as a fellow scholar, whose identity is not different from his subject ie people
 shrinivas jin logon yaa samudaay kaa adhyayan karte the unhen ve anya kii shrenee main nahin rakhte the
 In this regard, many British anthropologists have believed that anthropologists studying their society face different kinds of difficulties
 unke anusaar viksit desh kaa maanavshastri ek deshaj maanavshastri ko uski nimnatar sthiti kii ore ishaara karke hameshaa ek khaas saanche main kaid rakhana chahta he
 Srinivas, while clarifying the position of the indigenous anthropologist on this issue, wrote that when an Indian anthropologist studies any caste or other group of India, that caste or group is other for him but at the same time does not ignore this
 It should be done that certain cultural forms, beliefs and values of that caste or group also match the said scholar
 yani aisi sthiti main bhartiya maanavshastri asal main ek tarah se anya main swa kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 In this sense, that caste or group is not completely unfamiliar to him or her as both are connected to the same culture
 shrinivas is sthiti ko asaamaanya dhang se jatil, bahuparti or dwaidhapurna maanate hai
 Looking carefully, Srinivas does not seem to be accused of being a nationalist sociologist given the points of difference and equality with his subject
 vastav main shrinivas is baat par jor dete hai ki adhyayan main aatm or anya kii yah bahulata maanavshastri ke apane samudaay kaa sadsy hone yaa bahari hone kii ekalata se kahin zyaada shreyaskar he
 It is noteworthy that he uses many observations from the Chicago School to study the caste system of the village of Rampura, which was chosen by Srinivas for his research studies
 varna kii prak-british avadharana ko shrinivas kitaabi nazariyaa siddh karte hue yah kehete hai ki yah drushti jati ke gatisheel pakshon ko gaun kar detii he
 Although Srinivas's caste-study focused on the local structure of a village, he was also conscious of the pan-india prevalence of this phenomenon
 apane ek lekh main ve is tathy kii ore ishaara karte hai ki jati nihsandeh ek akhil bhartiya sanrachana he, kyonki desh main har jagah aise samooh dekhe ja sakate hai jo paitrukataa tathaa vaivaahik sambandhon ke aadhaar par ek vishisht samooh kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Srinivas also cites traditional employment of these groups in this regard
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki desh main har jagah brahman, achhut, kisaan, dastkaar, vyapaaree or dusron kii seva karne vaali jatiyon kaa astitv dekha ja saktaa he
 In this caste study, Srinivas also mentions regional variations and factors such as western education, administrative jobs, city income, which have had a major impact on the caste structure
 is tarah deergh avadhi ke lihaaj se dekhen to ek samajashastri ke taur par shrinivas ne bhartiya gram or jati kii sanrachana ko aupniveshik dharanaon ke saidhantik varchasv se bhi mukt karaayaa he
 At the same time, he also countered the beliefs of sociologists like Dumon who were proposing that caste differences do not allow the Indian village to become a community
 shrinivas jab gramin samudaay kii sankalpana or gaanvon kii aarthik-saanskrithik antar-nirbharta kii baat karte hai to ve avyakt dhang se akhil bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat bhi karte hai
 Some scholars believe that Srinivas has adopted a Brahminical or upper caste point of view in the study of caste
 lekin is daleel ko sahi kone se dekhen to vah darasal aupniveshik samajashaastra se nikali prathit hoti he
 Srinivas's logic-plan actually exposes the macro and under-concerned perceptions of Western sociologists regarding India's rural communities
 sankshep main kaha jaae to shrinivas kaa krititv pashchimi gyanshastreey prasthaapanaaon, swa, samudaay tathaa raashtra kii dharanaon ke aalochakeey vimarsh main kai buniyadi tark muhaiyaa karaata he

 St
 Thomas Aquinas is considered the greatest political thinker and philosopher of the medieval period
 vah ek mahaan vidwatavaadi tathaa samanvayvaadee tha
 Prof
 Dunning regarded him as the greatest scholar of all scholarly philosophers
 saint equinas ne na keval arestu or augustin ke balki anya vidhivettaon, dharamshastriyon or tikaakaron ke bhi paraspar virdohi vichaaron main samanvay sthapit kiya he
 That is why MB Foster called him the greatest ranked thinker in the world

 The 13th century philosopher Saint Thomas Aquinas was born in 1225 AD in Aquino, the state of Naples
 uskaa pita ekavini kaa count tha uski mata theodora thi
 St
 Thomas Aquinas had a full childhood
 uski janmajaat pratibha ko dekhakar uske mata-pita use ek ucch rajdhikari bananaa chaahate the
 Therefore, at the age of 5, he was sent to the school of Mount Cassino
 iske baad usne neples main shiksha grahan kii
 But her religious instincts shattered her parents' dreams and she accepted membership of the 'dominican denomination' in 1244 AD
 uske mata-pita ne use anek pralobhan dekar isaki sadsyta chhodane ke liye vivash kiya lekin uske drudh nishchay ne unki baat nahin maani
 So he went to Paris to get religious education
 vahaan par usne aadh yatmik netaa albert mahaan ke charnon main baithkar dharmik shiksha grahan kii
 After this he took interest in studies and teaching work in 1252 AD and he taught in many educational institutions in Italy
 is dauraan usne wiliam of morvek ke sampark main aane par arestu va uske tarkshastra par anek tikaayen likhin
 At that time there was no provision for monks to confer degrees at the University of Paris
 isliye pope ke hastkshep par hi use 1256 i main ’master of thiology‘ kii oopaadhi di gai
 After this, he served Christianity a lot by writing several books about Christianity
 pope tathaa anya raja bhi anek dharmik vishyon par uski salaah lene lag gaye
 At this time, his fame had spread all around
 apane samay ke mahaan prakand vidwaan kii alpaayu main hi 1274 i main mrityu ho gai
 After his death, in the 16th century he was honored with the title of 'doctor of the Church'
 saint thomas equinas ke raaj-darshan kaa pratibimb uski do rachanaayen ’di rejimine principam‘ tathaa ’camentry on aristotills politics‘ he
 In these compositions, along with the relations between the state and the church, other problems have also been discussed
 ye rachanaayen rajya va carch ke sambandhon kaa saar maani jaati hai
 These compositions are considered to be the essence of state and church relations
 ’summaa thiologica‘ bhi equinas kaa ek aisa mahaan granth mana jaataa he, jisamen plato tathaa arestu ke darshanashastra kaa roman kanoon or isai dharm-darshan ke saath samanvay sthapit kiya gaya he
 The law is narrowly interpreted and analyzed in this book
 ’rule of prince‘, ’summaa kantra jentailes‘ ’tu di king of cyprus‘ ’on kingship‘ bhi equinas kii anya rachanaayen hai
 In 'on Kingship', Aquinas discusses monarchy and civil rule
 uski sabhi rachanaayen uske mahaan vidwatavaadi hone ke daawey kii pushti karti hai
 The era of St
 Thomas Aquinas was an extraordinary era, both intellectually and religiously
 yah yug purna sanshleshan kaa yug tha
 This era was an era of complete synthesis in which the emphasis was on the communist approach
 yah vidwatawaad kaa yug tha jisamen jivan darshan kii naitik, saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik va anya samasyaon kaa sundar samavesh tha
 There were two main characteristics of scholasticism - tact and belief
 is yug main carch ke sarvachchata siddhanth kii taarkik yaa yuktiparak vyakhya karke yah spasht kiya gaya ki carch siddhanth tark ke vipareet nahin he
 Scholarship is an attempt to coordinate faith and tact, and between Greekism and Churchism, and to integrate all kinds of knowledge
 saint augustin ke vishwaas tathaa arestu ke vivek teen manzilen bhawan kii tarah he
 Its first floor is a symbol of science and the second floor is a symbol of philosophy
 darshanashastra vigyaan ke mul tattvon ko ekatrit kar unamem sah-sambandh sthapit karata he tathaa uske saarvbhaumik prayog tathaa manyata ke siddhanton ko nirdhaarit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 It is a generalized and well-informed summary of the sciences
 ye donon manzil maanav tark kaa pratik hai jinka samanvay va niyantran dharmadashran dwaara hona chahie
 Religion philosophy is the most important floor of the building
 yah dharm-darshan isai prakashna par nirbhar he jo darshanashastra tathaa vigyaan se sarvshereshth he
 Theology or Philosophy completes the system whose starting points are science and philosophy
 jis prakaar vivek darshan kaa aadhaar he, usee prakaar dharm-vigyaan kaa aadhaar vishwaas he
 There is no opposition between these two
 ve ek-duusare ke poorak hai
 Hence the mixture of both makes the building of knowledge stronger
 equinas kaa maananaa he ki dharm-vigyaan hi sarvacch gyaan he jo gyaan kii anya shakhaon - nitishastra, raajnneetishastra tathaa arthshaastra ko apane adheen rakhata he
 Thus Aquinas has coordinated the three great intellectual ideologies of medievalism - Universalism, Scholasticism and Aristotleism

 " West Indies batsman Viv Richards was famous for teaching a lesson to bowlers who dare to abuse themselves
 richards kaa itnaa dar tha ki kai captainon ne to apane khilaadiyon ko apshabd kehane par hi pabandi laga di thi

 symonds ne sweekaar kiya tha ki unhone hi do khilaadiyon ke bich aakraamak bhashaa kaa prayog kar apshabd kehane kii shuruyaat kii thi

 Sahih al-bukhari, also known as Bukhari Sharif
 sunni islam ke qutub al-sittaah main se ek he
 The traditions, or hadiths of these Prophet were collected by the Muslim scholar Muhammad al-bukhari
 is haddees kaa sangrah 846 / 232 hijri ke aasapaas puraa ho gaya tha
 Sunni Muslims consider Right Bukhari and Right Muslim as the two most trusted collections
 zadi shiya musalamaanon dwaara bhi ek pramanik haddees sangrah ke rup main mana or iskaa upyog bhi kiya jaataa he
 In some groups, it is considered the most authentic book after the Quran
 arabi shabd "sahih" kaa matlab pramanik yaa sahi kaa arth detaa he
 The right al-bukhari, along with the right Muslim, is called "sahihain"
 Others Others: ebn al-salaah ke anusaar, aamtaur par sahi al-bukaari ke naam se jane jaani vaali kitaab kaa vaastavik sheershak he: "al-jami 'al-sahih al-musnad al-mukhtsar min umuri rasulillaahi va sunnihi va ayyamihi" he
 There is a word-to-word translation of the title: a collection of authentic hadiths in relation to matters connected with the Prophet, his practices, and his period
 ebn hajar al-asakalani ne usee sheershak kaa ullekh kiya, jisamen umoor shabd ko haddees shabd se badal diya gaya tha
 al-bukhari traveled widely in Abbasid Khilafat from the age of 16, collecting traditions he believed to be trustworthy
 yah bataaya gaya he ki al-bukhari ne apane is sangrah main lagbhag 600,000 ullekhon ko ikatta karne main apane jivan ke 16 saal samarpit kiye the
 The sources differ on the exact number of hadiths in Bukhari's right, depending on whether the hadith is believed to be a description of the Prophet tradition
 visheshgyon ne, saamaanya rup se, 7,397 hadison ko purna-isnad hadison kii sankhya kaa anumaan lagaaya he, or unhi hadison main punrariti yaa vibhinn sanskarnon ke vichaaron ke bina, paigambar ke hadison kii sankhya lagbhag 2,602 tak kam ho gai he
 At that time, Bukhari saw and examined the Muttaluk earlier works of Hadith
 ur puri chaan been ke baad jise sahih or hasan mana jayega unheen ko sangrah kiya
 And many of them also include Daif or Zaif Hadith
 is se saafe zaahir hota he ki inako haddees ko sankalit karne main apni ruchi thi or unhon ne is ko kiya bhi
 To further strengthen his resolve, he was told by his teacher, the Hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-hanthali, "we were with Ishaq ibn Rahwayh, who said, 'if only you would compile a book of authentic stories of the Prophet
 ' yah suzav mere dil main rahaa, isliye maine sahih ko sankalit karnaa shuru kiya
 "bukhari also said," i saw the Prophet in a dream and it seemed that i was standing in front of him
 mere haath main ek pankhaa tha jisase main unki raksha kar rahaa tha
 When i asked some dreamers, they told me that "you will save them from lies"
 "yahi vah he jo mujhe sahih kaa utpaadan karne ke liye amada kiya tha
 " is pustak main islam ke uchit maargdarshan pradaan karne main jivan ke lagbhag sabhi pahaluon ko shaamil kiya gaya he jaise prarthana karne or paigambar mohammad dwaara ibaadaton ke anya kaaryon kii vidhi
 Bukhari completed his work around 846 / 232 Hijri, and spent the last twenty-four years of his life visiting other cities and scholars, teaching the Hadith he had collected
 bukhari ke har shahar main, hajaaron log mukhya masjid main ikatthe hote hai taaki un se sangrah kii gayi in paramparaon ko pard saken
 In response to Western academic doubts as to the actual date and author of the book named after him, scholars point out that the noted Hadith scholars of the time, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Yahya ibn Mayn, and Ali ibn al-madini, wrote Accepted the authenticity of the book and the collection gained instant fame
 yahan tak prasidd hua ki lekhak kii mrityu ke baad log is kitaab ko kisi sanshodhan kiye maanane lage or yah ek aitihaasik record ban gai
 During this period of twenty-four years, al-bukhari made minor modifications to his book, particularly the chapter title
 prayek sanskaran kaa naam iske varnanakarta dwaara kiya jaataa he
 According to Ibn Hajar al-asaklani in his book Nukta, the number of hadiths is the same in all editions
 bukhari ke ek bharosemand chaatr al-phirabari dwaara varnit sanskaran sabase prasiddh he
 al-khatib al-baghdadi in his book History Baghdad quotes Firaibari as saying: "seventy thousand people listened to Sahih Bukhari with me"

 Ibrahim ibn Maql, Hamma ibn Shaker, Mansoor Barduzi and Hussain Mahmili taught and spread this book to the next generations
 aisi kai kitaaben hai jo matbhed rakhti hai, jin main sab se aham fatah al-baari he
 Noted Islamic scholar Amin Ahsan Islahi lists three outstanding qualities of the rightful al-bukhari: ebn al-salaah ne kaha: "sahih ko lekhak banane vaale pehle bukhari, abu abd allaah mohammad ebn ismail al-juphy the, iske baad abu al-usan muslim ebn al-anjaj ek-naisaburi al-kushaayri the, jo unke chaatr the, saajha karte the ek hi shikshak
 These two books are the most authentic books after the Quran
 al-shafii ke bayaan ke liye, jinhone kaha, "mujhe malik kii kitaab kii tulana main gyaan yukt pustak kii jaankaree nahin he," - anya ek alag shabd ke saath iskaa ullekh kiya - unhone bukhari or musalmaan kii kitabon se pehle yah kaha
 Bukhari's book is both more authentic and more useful for both
 " Ibn Hajar al-asqlani quoted Abu Jafar al-uquila as saying, "bukhari wrote Sahih, he read it to Ali ibn al-madini, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Yahya ibn Mayn as well as others
 unhone ise mana ek acha prayaas or chaar haddees ke apwaad ke saath isaki pramanikta kii gavaahi di gai
 al-aquila then stated that Bukhari was indeed correct about those four hadiths
 " ebn hajar ne tab nishkarsh nikaala, "or ve vastav main pramanik hai
 " ebn al-salaah ne apane mukddima ebn al-ilaala fee 'ulam al-aadid main kaha : "yah hamen bataaya gaya he ki bukhari ne kaha he,' maine al-jami pustak main shaamil nahin kiya he ' jo pramanik he or maine kiya alpsankhyak ke liye anya pramanik haddees shaamil nahin he
 '"furthermore, al-dhahabi said," Bukhari was heard saying,' i have memorized one hundred thousand authentic hadiths and two hundred thousand which are less than authentic
 ' " In relation to female leadership, at least one famous hadith in Bukhari was written based on its content and its hadith narrator, which some authors did not consider authentic
 shehdeh haddees kii aalochana karne ke liye ling siddhant kaa upyog karata hai, jabaki faruk kaa maananaa he ki is tarah ke haddees islam main sudhaar ke liye asangat hai

 Explanation is given in the Hadith reported by Hazrat Aisha in the Imam Jarkashi Hadith collection: “


 He came to our house when the Prophet was in the middle of the sentence
 usne iske bare main keval ant suna
 What the Prophet said: 'allah rejects the Jews; They say three things bring bad luck: home, women and horses
 " 'is maamle main sawaal uthaaya gaya he ki bukhari main anya haddees ko apurna or kami kii uchit sandarbh soochna mili he yaa nahin The correct Bukhari Prophet's medicine and methods of treatment and hijama which are likely to be unscriptural have been introduced

 Ibn al-salah also said: "there are 7,275 hadiths in the book of Hadith, Sahih, in which some hadiths are repeated again and again
 aisa kaha gaya he ki baar-baar doharaai gayi hadison ko chhodkar yah sankhya 2,230 he
 "it is referring to those hadiths that are Musnad, originating from Muhammad and authenticated by the Companions

 In addition to the zines, the names of Clianthis and Crisippus are taken to confirm this philosophy
 "stoic darshan" ko teen bhaagon main prastut kiya jaataa he- tark, bhautikee tathaa niti
 Stoic philosophers did not find the suffixism of Aflatun and Aristotle acceptable
 unke vichaar se, chetana se bahya pratyayon kii koi satta nahin
 They are just thoughts, which the mind sees apart from things
 gyaan ko man kii kriti maanakar ve use niraashrith kalpana nahin bananaa chaahate the
 Therefore he said, knowledge reaches the mind through the senses
 stoic darshanikon ne hi, pehle pahal man ko kori pattee tehraaya tha
 However, like the modern English thinker John Locke, the Stoic mind was not considered a passive customer
 ve use kriyasheel samajhate the
 But he understood the need for sensory functions for the functioning of the mind
 german darshanik emanuel kaant kii gyanamimasaa padhate hue hamen stoic darshanikon kii isiilie yaad aa jaati he
 But after destroying the originality of the mind in the origin of knowledge, in the context of the truth of knowledge, Stoic experienced the same difficulties as the difficulties present in front of Locke and Kant
 gyaan ko unhone vastutantr mana tha
 Objects leave their influence on the senses
 inhen ke madhyam se man vastuon ko jaanata he
 Now the question arises that due to the mediation of the sensory effects, the object which the mind knows is external to it, then how can the truth of knowledge be tested? For all realists, this is a hard knot
 yaa phir henry bargsaan kii bhanti, aparokshanubhuti sweekaar kii jaae
 The Stoics had not considered anything like this
 isliye unhen yah maananaa padaa ki satya vastuon ke prabhaavon athwa pratibimb, swapnon or maatr kalpanaaon ke pratibimbon se kahin adhik spasht hote hai
 They generate a sense of truth or trust in us through their liveliness
 yah aatmagat bhaavana yaa vishwaas hi satya kii kasuti he
 Thus Stoic philosophers cultivated cognitive individualism

 He based knowledge on physical sensation
 isliye padaarth kii satta ko, jise ham andrik samvednaa dwaara jaanate hai, sweekaar karnaa aavashyak tha
 But they considered it unsuitable to accept the official dualism or plurality
 ve advaitavaadi the atev unke liye padaarth kii hi ekmaatr satta thi
 But they did not dispel the soul and God
 unhen bhi padaarth main hi sthaan diya
 This view is different from the traditional views of God and the soul, but the Stoic philosophers accepted it only by insistence on the rule of non-opposition
 unki gyanamimasaa padaarth kii satta siddh kar rahi thi
 To explain the unity of the world, it was appropriate to consider it as originating from a single source
 aatma or sharir ke sambandh par vichaar karne se bhi unhen yahi yuktiyukt prathit hua
 The soul and body perform actions and reactions on each other

 With the establishment of the soul, the establishment of global consciousness or global intelligence becomes necessary
 isliye unhone ishwar or sansar main vahi sambandh mana jo vyaktigat buddhi or sharir main hota he
 He coordinated these ideas with the idea of ancient primary material or factor of Greek philosophy
 heraclitis ne isapurv chhathi shatabdi main kaha tha, agni vah praathmik tatv he jisase vishwa kaa nirmaan hua
 Stoic philosophers saw nature in fire and intelligence and said that primary fire is God
 is prakaar unhone ek sarvaad kii sthapana kii, jisamen sansar ke moulik upadan yaa prakruti, ishwar, aatma, buddhi or padaarth ke arthon main koi moulik antar na tha
 On the basis of this belief, the Stoics had no difficulty in believing that the world was subject to intellectual law

 But now he had no proper reasoning for establishing the freedom of the individual
 uske swabhaav main bauddhik niyam kii vyapti hone se, vah jo kuch karata he, swaabhaavik he, bauddhik he
 This was the same difficulty that stuck in the moral mind of German philosopher Emmanuel Kant

 He said that human beings are intellectual beings because of the prevalence of intellectual law in nature
