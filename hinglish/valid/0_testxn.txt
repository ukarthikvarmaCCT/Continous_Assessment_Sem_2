 mohiniattam bharat ke kerala rajya ke do shastreey nrityon main se ek he, jo abhi bhi kaaphi lokapriy he kerala kii ek anya shastreey nrity kathakali bhi he
 The word Mohiniattam is derived from the name Mohini, the form of Mohini was worn by Lord Vishnu, the god of Hindus, so that good forces can prevail over evil forces

 The motives of gangs fighting in civil war are different

 An understanding of the relationship between electricity and magnetism began in 1819 with the work of Professor Hans Christian Orsted of the University of Copenhagen, who discovered, more or less accidentally, that an electric wave can affect the compass needle
 yah aitihaasik prayog orsted prayog ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Several other experiments followed them, with the discovery of further connections between magnetism and electricity by andre-marie Ampere, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Michael Faraday, and others

 The Einstein – Day Haas effect "rotation by magnetization" and inversely the Barnett effect or "magnetism by rotation" present a very close relationship between the angular momentum and magnetism on a macro scale
 parmaanu or up-parmaanu paimaane par, yah sambandh ghurna chumbakeey anupaat, koniya samveg ke prati chumbakeey aghurna ke anupaat dwaara vyakt hota he
 The origin of magnetism emerges from two sources: chumbakeey samagriyon main, chumbakatv ke strot nabhik ke aas-paas electron kii kakshiya koniya gati or electronon ke aantarik chumbakeey samveg hote hai 
 chumbakatv ke anya strot hai nabhik ke parmaanu chumbakeey samveg jo aam taur par electron chumbakeey sanvegon se kai hazaar guna chote hote hai, atah ve tatwon ke chumbakan ke sandarbh main naganya hai
 Nuclear magnetic moments are important in other contexts, particularly nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance reflection
 aam taur par, kisi dravya main electronon kii baari sankhya is prakaar vyavasthit hoti he ki unke chumbakeey samveg radd ho jate hai
 This is due in part to the Pauli exclusion principle of electrons combining into pairs with opposite intrinsic magnetic moments, or to subunits complemented with zero net orbital motion
 In both cases, the electron arrangement is to completely cancel the magnetic moments from each electron
 iske alaava, jab electron vinyas aisa he ki ayugmit electron or / yaa apurit upakosh maujuud hai, bahudhaa aisa maamla hota he ki thos main vividh electron chumbakeey sanvegon main yogadan dete hai jo alag, yadrichhik dishaao main ingit hote hai, jisase saamagree chumbakeey nahin hoti he
 But, sometimes - either spontaneously or due to the external magnetic field used - each electron magnetic momentum settles, on average
 iske baad dravya nival kul chumbakeey kshetra utpann kar saktaa he, jo sambhawatah kaaphi majboot ho saktaa he
 The magnetic behavior of matter depends on its structure, especially the electron configuration for the above reasons as well as the temperature
 ucch taapmaana par, yadrichhik tapiya samveg electron ke liye sanrekhan kaa anurakshan adhik jatil bana detaa he
 Anti-magnetism appears in all liquids and the tendency of the elements to resist the applied magnetic field and, therefore, to be repelled by the magnetic field
 haalanki, anuchumbakeey gunon vaale dravya main, anuchumbakeey vyavhaar haaavee hota he
 Thus, despite its universal presence, counter-magnetic behavior is seen only in purely counter-magnetic matter
 kisi prati-chumbakeey dravya main, koi ayugmit electron nahin hote hai, atah aantarik electron chumbakeey samveg koi thok prabhaav utpann nahin kar sakate hai
 In these cases, magnetism emerges from the orbital moments of the electron, which can be classically understood as: kripaya dhyaan den ki yah vivaran keval swatahshodh ke rup main he; uchit samaj ke liye kwantum-yantric vivaran kii aavashyaktaa he
 Note that all liquids undergo this orbital reaction
 tathaapi, anuchumbakeey or louh chumbakeey padaarthon main, prati-chumbakatv prabhaav ayugmit electronon ke bahut majboot prabhaav se abhibhoot hai
 There are unpaired electrons in a molecular material, ie atomic or molecular orbital, which has only one electron
 jabaki pauli apvarjan siddhant ke anusaar yugmit electronon ke liye zaruri he ki unke aantarik chumbakeey samveg vipareet dishaao main ingit hon, jo unke chumbakeey kshetron ko radd kar den, ek ayugmit electron apane chumbakeey samveg ko kisi bhi disha main sanrekhit karne ke liye swatantra he
 When an external magnetic field is used, these magnetic moments align themselves to the direction of the field used, thereby reinforcing them
 anu-chumbakeey dravya ke anusaar louh-chumbak main ayugmit electron hote hai
 However, in addition to the tendency of electrons' magnetic moments to be parallel to a used field, these fluids also have a tendency to configure these magnetic moments parallel to each other to maintain a low energy state

 Each ferromagnetic substance has its own individual temperature, called the Curie temperature or Curie point, above which it loses its ferromagnetic properties

 Some well-known ferromagnetic materials that exhibit readily recognizable magnetic properties are nickel, iron, cobalt, gadolinium, and their alloys
 kisi louh-chumbakeey dravya main parmaanuon ke chumbakeey samveg unhen chote sthai chumbakon kii bhaanti vyavhaar karne ke liye baadhya karte hai
 They are joined together and align in small regions with more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or Weiss domains
 chumbakeey domen ko, chitra main safed rekhaon ke samaan dikhne vaali chumbakeey domen simaaon ko prakat karne ke liye ek chumbakeey bal sookshmdarshi ke madhyam se dekha ja saktaa he
 Many scientific experiments exist that can physically show magnetic fields

 When in contact with the magnetic field, the domain boundaries move so that domains aligned with the magnetic field increase and dominate the structure as shown on the left
 When the magnetizing field is removed, the domains may not return to the non-magnetic state
 As a result, the iron-magnetic material becomes magnetic, forming a permanent magnet
 jab paryaapt dridhtaa se chumbakeey ho jaataa he taaki maujuuda domen baaqi sabhi ko keval ek ekal domen main samet den, tab dravya chumbakeey rup se santrupt ho jaataa he
 When the magnetic ferromagnetism material is heated to the Curie point temperature, the molecules are stirred to the point that the organization of the magnetic domain is shattered and the magnetic properties derived from them dissipate
 jab dravya ko thanda kiya jaataa he, is domen kii sanrekhan sanrachana anayas is prakaar laut aati he jaise drav crystalia thos main jam jaataa he
 Electrons with nearby traction have a tendency of intrinsic magnetic momentum to point in opposite directions from anti-ferromagnetism to counter-ferromagnetism
 jab sabhi parmaanu, padaarth main vyavasthit hote hai taaki prayek padosi 'prati-sanrekhit' hon, padaarth prati-lauhachumbakeey hota he
 Anti-ferromagnets have zero net magnetic momentum, meaning no field is created by them
 prati-lauhachumbak anya prakaar ke vyavhaaron kii tulana main kam saamaanya hai or zyaadaatar kam taapmaana par dekhe ja sakate hai
 At different temperatures, it can be seen by anti-ferromagnets exhibiting anti-magnetic and ferromagnetic properties

 However, like anti-ferromagnets, neighboring pairs of electrons spin in opposite directions

 Magnetite, the first discovered magnetic substance, was originally thought to be an iron-magnet; However, with the discovery of iron-magnetism, Louis Neill falsified it
 jab louh-chumbak paryaapt chota hota he, vah brounian samveg ke adheen ekal chumbakeey prachakran ke samaan kaary karata he
 Its response to the magnetic field is qualitatively similar to that of a magnetometer, but much larger
 vidyut-chumbak ek aisa chumbak he jiskaa chumbakatv vidyut dhara ke pravaah se utpann hota he
 When the current stops, the magnetic field disappears
 yaa ek chumbak
 As a result of Einstein's special theory of relativity, electricity and magnetism are fundamentally interlinked
 donon, vidyut rahit chumbakatv or chumbakatv rahit vidyut, vishesh saapekshata ke saath lambaai sankuchan, samay vistaar or is tathy ke chalate ki chumbakeey bal veg aadhaarit he, jaise prabhaavon ke kaaran asangat hai
 However, when both electricity and magnetism are taken into account, the resulting theory is completely consistent with special relativity
 vishesh rup se, jo ghatana ek paryvekshak ko vishuddh rup se vidyutiya lagati he vahi duusare ko vishuddh rup se chumbakeey lag sakati he, yaa adhik saamanytah vidyut or chumbakatv ke saapeksh yogadan sandarbh ke dhaanche par nirbhar karti he
 Thus, special relativity "mixes" electricity and magnetism into a single, indivisible element called electromagnetism, which corresponds to relativity "mixing" space and time into space-time
 chumbakatv tatv kii "madhyasthata" chumbakeey kshetra dwaara kiya jaataa he
 An electric current or magnetic dipole generates a magnetic field and that field, in turn, imparts magnetic force to other particles in the field
 maxwell ke sameekaran, jo sthir dhaaraon ke maamle main biot-sawart siddhant ko saral banaate hai, in balon ko shasit karne vaale kshetron ke mul or vyavhaar ko varnit karte hai
 Therefore magnetism is observed whenever electrically charged particles are moving --- for example, by the movement of electrons in an electric current, or in some cases by the orbital motion of electrons around the nucleus of an atom
 They also originate from "internal" magnetic dipoles emerging from quantum-mechanical spinning
 chumbakeey kshetra banane vaali sthitiyaan hi - dhara main yaa ek parmaanu or aantarik chumbakeey dwidhruv main gatisheel aavesh - bhi aisi sthitiyaan hai jinamein chumbakeey kshetra kaa bal utpann karte hue, ek prabhaav hota he
 The formula for dynamic charge is as follows; For forces on the inner dipole, see magnetic dipole
 jab koi aaweshit kan chumbakeey kshetra b ke madhyam se guzarataa he, vah prati utpaada dwaara die gaye f laurenz bal ko mahasoos karata he: where kyonki yah prati-utpaada he, bal kan kii gati or chumbakeey kshetra, donon ke lamb main he
 This follows that the magnetic force does no work on the particle; He can change the direction of motion of the particle, but cannot accelerate or slow down its movement
 Magnitude of force is jahaan θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } v or b ke bich kaa kone he
 One tool for determining the direction, magnetic field, and applied force of the velocity vector of a moving charge is to label the index finger of your right hand as "V", the middle finger as "B", and the thumb as "F"

 Although the magnet is said to have a North Pole and a South Pole, these two poles cannot be separated from each other

 phir bhi, kuch saidhantik bhautikee namoonay in chumbakeey ekadhruvon ke astitv kaa purvanumaan lagaate hai
 In 1931 Paul Dirac observed that due to some symmetry in electricity and magnetism, such as quantum theory predicts that individual positive or negative charges can be seen without opposite charges, the isolated south and north magnetic poles must be reflected

 This "exchange" element is an expression of the quantum mechanical property that particles with similar properties cannot be distinguished

 In the case of the spin function χ { \ displaystyle \ chi}, which is responsible for magnetism, we have already mentioned the Pauli principle, such that a symmetric orbital must be multiplied with a counter-symmetric spin function and vice versa
 Like this: yani, na keval u a { \ displaystyle u_{a}} or u b { \ displaystyle u_{b}} ko, α or β dwaara kramshah pratisthapit kiya janaa chahie, balki chihn + ko - chihn dwaara or antat r i asatat mulyon dwaara s i ; jisase hamaare paas hai α = β = 1 { \ displaystyle \ alpha = \ beta =1} or α = β = 0 { \ displaystyle \ alpha = \ beta =0}

 Rather than being concerned about recycling relatively small amounts of mixed plastics, these proponents believe that certified biodegradable plastics can be quickly mixed with other organic wastes, leading to large amounts of unprovable solid waste

 Many researchers have evaluated the intensive life cycle of biodegradable polymers to determine whether these materials are more energy efficient than conventional fossil fuel-based tools
 Gerngross and others estimated that 50
4 MJ / kg of fossil fuel energy used to manufacture one kilogram of polyhydroxyalkanoate was similar to another estimate by Akiyama and others, which measured this value between 50–59 MJ / kg

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics

 Prominent among many names of Nanda are Shiva, Sunanda, Shubhananda, Nandini
 puure uttaranchal main samaan rup se puuje jane ke kaaran nandadevi ke samast pradesh main dharmik ekta ke sutara ke rup main dekha gaya he
 The eighth-century Siddha Vinayaka black stone idol of Lord Ganesha, located in Baguwasa, Narkankal of Roopkund, proves the historicity of this journey, as well as the traditional Nanda Jagari of Garhwal also tells the story of this journey
 nandadevi se judy jaat do prakaar kii hai
 Annual Jat and Rajajat

 In this journey, a distance of about 250 km is required to walk from Nauti to Homkund
 is dauraan ghaney jangalon patharile margon, durgam chotiyon or barfile pahaado ko paar karnaa padataa he
 These dolis are found in different routes
 iske alaava gaanv-gaanv se doliyaan or chhatauliyaan bhi is yatra main shaamil hoti he
 From Kumaon, the dummies from Almoda, Katarmal and Nainital come to Nandakeshari and join Rajajat
 nauti se shuru hui is yatra kaa doosraa padaav ida-badhaanin he
 Then the journey returns to Nauti
 iske baad kasunwa, saim, koti, bhagauti, kulsari, chapadon, lohajang, vaann, bedani, paatar nachuniyan se vishwa-vikhyath rupkund, shila-samudr, homkund se chananyaanghat, sutol se ghat hote hue nandaprayag or phir nauti aakar yatra kaa chakra puraa hota he
 This distance is about 280 kilometers

 People believe that Chausingya Khadu disappears further in the Bikat Himalayas and enters Kailash, the region of Nandadevi
 varsh 2000 main is rajajat ko vyapak prachaar mila or desh-videsh ke hajaaron log isamen shaamil hue the
 Rajajat represents the overall culture of Uttarakhand
 isi liye 26 janvari 2005 ko uttaranchal rajya kii jhaanki rajajat par nikaali gai thi
 Roopkund Mahotsav is also being organized by the Department of Tourism for the last few years
 sthaneey logon ne is yatra ke safal sanchaalan hetu shri nandadevi rajajat samiti kaa gathan bhi kiya he
 The Nandadevi Rajajat is organized under the auspices of this committee

 {according to beliefs, Rajajat occurs when symptoms of defecting to the goddess appear

 The meditators take out the yatra, which is called Dole Jatara
 kasuna ke kunwar nauti gaanv jaakar rajajat kii manauti karte hai
 Kunwar brings Ringal's Chhatoli and Chausingya Khadu
 chousinga khadu kaa janm lenaa rajajat kii ek khaas baat he
 The Nautiyals and Kunwar people carry the gift of Nanda on the back of Chausinga Khadu to the homkund
 vahaan se khadu akelaa hi aage bad jaataa he
 Bizarre miraculous events begin with the birth of Khadu
 jis gaushala main yah janm letaa he usee din se vahaan sher aana prarambh kar detaa he or jab tak khadu kaa maalik use rajajat ko arpit karne kii manauti nahin rakhata tab tak sher lagaataar aata hi rahata he

 According to the program announced on the occasion of Basant Panchami, this yatra will be completed on September 16 after lasting for 19 days
 is himalayan mahakumbh main samay ke saath dharmik paramparaayen to badalati rahi hai magar saamanti paramparaayen kab badalengi, yah sawaal munh baayen khadaa ho kar loktantrkaamiyon ko chidhaata ja rahaa he
 Like the inauguration of Badrinath, the Kunvars of Kasuwa village in Chamoli Garhwal and their Rajguru Nautiyals of Nauti village also announced the program of Nandadevi Rajajat on this Basant Panchami
 consuva gaanv ke thakur swayan ko sadiyon tak gadhwal par ecchhatra raaj karne vaale panvar vansh ke ek raja ajaypal ke chote bhai ke vanshaj maanate hai or isiliye ve raja ke taur par is himalayan dharmik padayatra kaa netritv karne ke saath hi use apana nijee kaarykram maanate hai
 The descendants of the Tehri monarchy also set the date of Kapatodar of Badrinath every year on Basant Panchami
 kuvaron or nautiyaalon dwaara ghoshit kaarykram ke anusaar yah yatra 29 agast ko nauti se chelgi or himalayan kshetra main 19 padaavon ke baad aagaamee 16 sitambar ko waapas laut jaayegi
 People from foreign countries reach to witness this risky journey

 The state government also seems to be standing firm with the feudal system instead of religious sentiments and pre-tradition
 rajajat ke liye uttrakhand sarkaar sahit aayojan samiti or anya sambandhit pakshon ne taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 With this, the search for Chausingya Khadu to lead this historic journey has also started
 yatra se pehle is tarah kaa vicitra mendha chandpur or dasholi pattiyon ke gaavon main se kahin bhi janm letaa rahaa he
 About 200 local deities along with ringle-rings, bundles and markings made of special workmanship are included in this procession

 yatra ke dauraan puure solahaven padaav tak yah khadu yaa mendha nanda devi kii ringaal se bani chantoli ke paas hi rahata he
 Reaching a height of 3200 feet to 17500 feet above sea level, this 280 km long trek passes through 19 stops
 wan yatra kaa antim gaanv he
 There are also evidence of its 22 halts in ancient times
 wan se aage kii yatra durgam hoti hai or saath hi pratibandhit evam nishedhaatmak bhi ho jaati he
 According to the accounts of Bhuvan Nautiyal and his father Devaram Nautiyal, who are acting as the secretary of the Organizing Committee and the representative of the Nautiyal Brahmins, the leather goods such as shoes, belts, etc
, and gaje-gaja, women from Rinkidhar, a little ahead of Vana
 -children, eatables, etc

 abhakshya khaane vaali jatiyon kaa taatpary chipa nahin he
 There is no tradition of the participation of Scheduled Castes in this Yatra and the State Government's participation in this event directly recognizes not only the feudal system but also the evil of untouchability

 According to Dr
 Dabral etc
, the Roopkund accident took place in 1150 in which Kannauj Naresh Jasdhaval or Yashodhaval and his wife Rani Ballabha, who had come to join Rajajat, died for the safety and recreation, etc
, with a number of hundreds
 jinke kankal aaj bhi rup kund main bikhare huye hai
 Records of the Rajajat held at Nauti in 1843, 1863, 1886, 1905, 1925, 1951, 1968 and 1987 are available
 isse spasht hota he ki prachlit manyatanusaar yah yatra har 12 saal main nahin nikalati rahi he
 The inscriptions received from Kurud contain the details of the kingdoms of 1845 and 1865
 kurud ke pujari or adhikansh itihaaskaar nanda ko panvaron kii nahin balki khason kii pracheenatam tirthayatra maanate hai

 Its first stop is Edha Badhani at 10 km

 After Nauti, the journey through Sem, Koti, Bhagoti, Kulsari, Chepdiun, Nandakeshari, Faldia village, Mundoli, Vana, Garolipital, Pataranchauni reaches its destination Homkund via Shilasamudra

 Some arrows have been fired for museums

 yahaan se neeche chalaang lagane waalon ke saath hi durghatana main maare gayi sekadon yatriyon ke kankal neeche rupkund main mili hai jinaki pushti diene se huyi he
 After this, the yatra descends towards the sea

 From there, the flame of the three lamps, along with the sun's flame appearing on the Nandaghughti peak in front, gives a unique view

 Due to no restriction, these men have taken away the skeletons and other relics from the Roopkund lake, located at an altitude of 16200 feet above the sea level, by filling them in the scientific sacks of foreign countries
 phir bhi maanav bastiyon se bahut upar is jhil ke kinare ab bhi kai kankal pade hai
 Meat has also been found on some skeletons
 kankalon ke saath hi aabhushan, rajasthani juute, paan supaari, ke daag lage daant, shankh, shankh kii chudiyaan aadi saamagree bikhri padi he
 These hundreds of skeletons were first detected by a forest ranger in 1942
 is jhil ke kankalon par sabase pehle 1957 main amareeki vigyaani dow james graffin ne adhyayan kiya tha
 At that time, he had stated the age of these skeletons to be about 650

 saamanti parampara ke samarthakon kaa daawa he ki consuva gaanv ke log gadhwal naresh ajay paal ke banshaj hai

 Any citizen of India has the freedom to write anything his caste
 koi swayan ko shahenshaah bhi likh saktaa he, lekin vah shahenshaah ho nahin jaataa he
 If the surveyors of this journey are writing themselves as Rajkumar, they also have the freedom to do this, but they do not have the freedom to treat people like a prince

 pandit harikrishna ratudi dwaara likhe gayi gadhwal ke itihaas ke anusaar ajaypal ne san 1512 main chandpur gadhi se devalgarh main rajdhani sthantarit kii thi
 Many intellectuals of Uttarakhand still consider it irrational and feudal to think of themselves as Rajkumar by some of the bons of a king's brother about 500 years ago
 unka maananaa he ki ajaypal se lekar antim raja manvendra shah tak hajaaron rajkumaar paidaa huye honge or aaj unke vanshajon kii sankhya lakhon main ho gayi hogi
 But none of them called themselves Rajkumar, nor treated others in the area like a king
 maharaja manvendra shah ke mausere bhai yaa parivaar ke anya bhai bhi swayan ko raajkanvar nahin bataate
 Exactly how is it possible that the kings born after leaving Chandpur Garhi should not be born

 In the Gazetteer of the Himalayan districts, ET Atkinson has given a list of the Garhwal king compiled by some scholars
 inamen hardvik kii suchi main 61 raajaaon main se ajaypal kaa naam kahin nahin he
 Hardwicke has given some names like Surat Singh, Ramdev, Mangalsen, Chinaman, Ramnarayan, Premnath, Ramru and Fateh Shah, which does not indicate that these kings may have been related to the same dynasty

 swayan atkinson ne kaha he ki ye ve raja the jinhone kuch prasiddhi hasil kii yaa kuch khaas baton ke liye itihaas main darj ho gayi
 Otherwise, there would have been many other kings in Garhwal during that time

 Earlier, in the Rajajat held in 1987, after 19 years, the caste of Nanda Devi of Kansuva and Nauti and Nanda Devi of Kurud have also been separated
 us samay bhi nauti or consuva waalon kii rajajat sarkaar dwaara vitt poshit thi or uske peeche chal rahi kurud kii jaat paramparaon or aasthaaon dwaara poshit thi
 Due to this ancient religious event being stuck in feudalism, casteism and regionalism, doubts are being raised over the success of the yatra

 windos vista microsoft ke oparating system kii shrinkhalaa kii sabase nai kadi he or sambhawatah windos 95 ke pashchaat sabase krantikari bhi
 Although the Vista operating system has gained more popularity due to its three-dimensional graphics format and various desktop animations, it is in fact considered to be the most secure operating system ever released by Microsoft
 sanchaar or netwarking ke lihaaj se bhi yah apane se pichley aaparating system kii tulana main zyada kshamtawan he
 Hindi support for Vista is also fully available and through the Hindi Language Interface Pack, Windows Vista can be fully painted in Hindi
 computer upyogkartaaon ke man main jigyaasa he ki kya sachmuch unhen microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya nayaa oparating system windos vista apnaane kii jarurat he
 Does Microsoft's previous operating systems Windows XP Windows 2003 and Windows 2000 have such features that it is not possible to ignore
 microsoft kaa daawa he ki vista pichley windos kii tulana main adhik sakasham, saral, tej, sudarshan or surakshit he
 Vista opens and closes faster than previous operating systems
 start ap or shat down prakriyaayein paanch se das second main puri ho jaati hai
 Although Vista's relatively better hardware also contributes to this, special efforts have been made in the code of the operating system itself
 vista kii teji kaa kaaran uski memri ke prabandhan kii nai takanic bhi he jo adhik istemaal kiye jane vaale anuprayogon ko pehle se hi loding ke liye taiyaar rakhti he
 This is called 'memory fetch'
 vista main die gaye ready boost feechar ne bhi isaki gati badhaane main yogadan diya he
 Until now, pagefiles were used as virtual memory to meet additional memory requirements in Windows
 inhen computer kii hard discs par rakhaa jaataa tha
 But Vista has a provision of using a USB drive that works at a much faster speed than a hard disk
 microsoft ne apane nae aaparating system main hybrid hard drive saport bhi pradaan kiya he jiske tahat flash drive or paaramparik hard drive donon ko sanyukt rup se istemaal kar computer kii gati badha jaati he
 One of the first things to get noticed in Windows Vista is its beautiful vocal and graphic effects called Windows Aero
 haalaanki maikintosh computer par is tarah ke sudarshan graphics pehle se hi maujuud hai lekin windos plateform par ye pehali baar 'vista' ke madhyam se hi saamne aae hai
 On computers with Windows Vista Home Premium, Business, Ultimate and Enterprise editions that have a good graphics adapter, Aero's stunning graphics effects can be enjoyed
 is mukhaawaran ne windos kaa kalevar hi badal diya he or use pehle kii tulana main behad aakarshak, vividhtapurna or shaleen bana diya he
 Aero's high quality graphics and visual effects enhance the beauty of a Windows computer but it does not impair the functionality or speed of the computer

 Microsoft has paid special attention to this in Vista
 haalaanki vista kii mul 'karnel' to nae sire se nahin likhi he lekin uski suraksha ko is baar bahut majboot bana diya gaya he
 First of all, now not all parts of this operating system run in kernel mode, but only a select few of them run
 vista main zyaadaatar driver or software yujar mod main chalate hai or karnel mod main kisi bhi na cheez ko install karnaa aasaan nahin rah gaya he
 This requires security certificate and administrator level rights
 or administrator str ke visheshadhikaar praapt karnaa, visheshkar daftaron main, ab bahut mushkil hoga
 Windows Vista has limited common user rights
 aisa bhi nahin he ki aap bataur saamaanya upyogkarta ke apane computer main ko software instaal hi na kar paaen
 To do this, they get the necessary rights temporarily
 microsoft ne vista aaparating system install karne ke lihaaj se computaron kii do shreniyan banaai hai- vista capable pisi or vista premium ready 
 All such computers are Windows Vista enabled with at least 800 mhz processor and 512 MB system memory available
 is tarah ke procesar to ab durlabh se ho gaye hai kyonki bazaar main 2 gigahatrj se kam ke procesar shaayad hi koi kharid rahaa ho
 If you have bought your computer in the last two years, then its processor will have at least this much capacity
 rahi system memri kii baat to ho saktaa he ki aapke paaramparik computer main 128 embi yaa 256 embi memri lagi ho
 In such a situation, you may have to upgrade your RAM by spending seven to eight hundred rupees

 Fox has two dogs, one of whom is a Pomeranian, named after the vile-symbol Sid Vicious
 Fox has openly stated that she is intoxicated and therefore means that she knows that she does not like them and also says that she knows some people who do not have drugs, including herself
 is
 fox ne khuleam kaha he ki vah marijuana ke vaidhikaran kaa samarthan karti he or kahati he ki vah ise nasha nahin maanati he or isliye ek jodi pudiya kharidne kii qatari main vah sabase aage khadi hogi
 In September 2008, Fox indicated being bisexual; In an interview with GQ magazine, she said that she fell in love with a female evasive when she was 18 and wanted to have a relationship with him
 usne is anubhav kaa prayog apni aasthaa ko pratipaadit karne ke liye kiya ki "sabhi manushyon kaa janm donon lingon ke prati aakarshith hone kii kshamta ke saath hua he" or iske alaava usne olivia wild or jena jemson main apni dilchaspee dikhaai

 "they are boys; they can be played with great ease," he said
 "I tell stories and have fed them with my own hands
 Not all of it is true
 vastav main, isamen se adhikansh bakawaas he
 "fox said," i never said that she was my girlfriend! i just said that i loved her and i loved her
 vaastavik kahani or bhi gambhir he
 This is not an erotic, funny, fictional story
 lekin vah aisi kahani nahin he jise aap GQ ko sunaate hai
 "on 15 June 2009, at the UK premiere of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Fox revealed a brief love affair with Cheryl Cole and her desire for Cole's tattoos
 june 2009 main ek prastuti ke dauraan, da kyle and jaiki o sho par, usne bayaan diya ki purush korian pop gayak rain main uski dilchaspee he
 In addition Fox has also revealed his insecurities and self-harm
 vah yah bhi maanati he ki usamen atmasamman kii bhaavana bahut kam he
 In addition, Fox is feared during the flight; She said that this fear arose in her when she turned 20
 She has found some ways to avoid the dreaded trauma while boarding a plane, and on such occasions she keeps herself calm, especially by listening to songs by Britney Spears
 iske alaava, usne purushon ke prati apane avishvaas kii bhaavana ko bhi vyakt kiya he
 "I don't like or believe them at all," Fox said

 isi taratamya main kendriya hindi nideshaalay dwaara varsh 2003 main devanagari lipi tathaa hindi vartanee ke maanakeekaran ke liye akhil bhartiya sangoshtee kaa aayojan kiya tha
 In this seminar the following rules were laid down for standard Hindi spelling which has been implemented in the year 2012 as IS / IS 16500: 2012
 vartmaan samay main maanak hindi vartanee kaa kaaryakshetra kendriya hindi nideshaalay kaa he
 Many veterans have made their contribution towards standardization of Hindi spelling, out of which the names of Acharya Kishoridas Vajpayee and Acharya Ramchandra Varma are notable
 hindi bhashaa ke sangh or kuch rajyon kii rajbhasha sweekrut ho jane ke falswaroop desh ke bheetar or baahar hindi seekhney waalon kii sankhya main paryaapt vruddhi ho jane se hindi vartanee kii maanak paddati nirdhaarit karnaa aavashyak or kalochit laga, taaki hindi shabdon kii vartaneeyon main adhikadhik ekarupata laai ja sake
 Accordingly, the Ministry of Education, Government of India appointed an Expert Committee in 1961 to determine the standard method of Hindi spelling
 is samiti ne april 1962 main antim report di
 The committee had four meetings in which after serious deliberation a rule regarding spelling was laid down

 The Central Hindi Directorate first published a small booklet in 1968 titled "standardization of Hindi Spelling"
 varsh 1983 main is pustika kaa ni:shulk sanshodhit evam parivardhit sanskaran “devanagari lipi tathaa hindi vartanee kaa maanakeekaran” prakashit kiya gaya
 In view of the ever increasing demand of this booklet, it was reprinted in the year 1989 and free distribution was made in various Hindi service institutions, offices, educational institutions to increase the use of standard form of Hindi in more and more institutions

 The mainstay of standardization in the year 1968 was the user and the typing machine
 soochna ke aaj ke yug main hindi bhashaa ke maanakeekaran ko pun: sanshodhit evam parivartit karne tathaa devanagari lipi ke liye computerikrut unicode ke nirmaan karne kii aavashyaktaa anubhav kii gai
 In this context, the All India Seminar was organized by the Central Hindi Directorate in the year 2003 for standardization of Devanagari script and Hindi spelling
 is sangoshtee main maanak hindi vartanee ke liye jo niyam nirdhaarit kiye gayi the unka vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 In the book "standardization of Devanagari script and Hindi spelling", the standard Hindi alphabet, standard Hindi spelling, punctuation, alphabets in lexicons, enhanced Devanagari script, etc
, are related to the division and subdivision of topics and paragraphs

 Such as: - Kuttim, Chitthiyan, Dvidya, Buddhisthaman, Chhinit etc
 tippanee : sanskrit bhashaa ke mul shlokon ko uddhrut karte samay sanyuktakshar puraani style se bhi likhe ja sakenge
 Such as - Joint, Icon, Learning, Scholar, Older, Second, Wisdom etc
 kintu yadi inhen bhi uparyukt niyamon ke anusaar hi likhaa jaae to koi aapatti nahin hogi
 2
2
1 Signs of Hindi should be written separately from the primary in all noun words
 jaise :– ram ne, ram ko, ram se, stri kaa, stri se, seva main aadi
 In pronoun words, these signs should be written together with the phrase
 jaise :– tuune, aapane, tumse, usne, usko, usase, usapar aadi 
 2
2
2 If two factors are marked with the pronoun, the first of them should be combined and the second written separately
 jaise :– uske liye, isamen se
 2
2
3 If there is a collision between the pronoun and the causative mark 'he', 'even', etc
, the causative mark should be written separately
 jaise :– aap hi ke liye, mujh tak ko
 All conjunctive verbs should be written separately in joint verb terms
 jaise :– padhaa karata he, aa saktaa he, jaaya karata he, khaaya karata he, ja saktaa he, kar saktaa he, kiya karata tha, padhaa karata tha, khelaa karegaa, ghumta rahegaa, badhate chale ja rahe hai aadi
 2

0 hyphens are legislated for clarity
 2
4
1 dwandv samaas main padon ke bich hifan rakhaa jaae
 Such as: - ram-laxman, shiva-parvati dialogues, care, movement, laughter-jokes, transactions, reading-writing, eating-drinking, playing-jumping etc
 2
4
2 sa, jaisaa aadi se purv hifan rakhaa jaae
 Like: - You-like, Ram-like, sharp with a knife
 2
4
3 tatpurush samaas main hifan kaa prayog keval vahiin kiya jaae jahaan uske bina bhram hone kii sambhaavna ho, anyathaa nahin
 Such as: - Earth element
 saamanyat: tatpurush samaas main hifan lagane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Such as - Ramrajya, Rajkumar, Gangajal, villagers, suicide etc
 2
4
3
1 isi tarah yadi 'a-nikh' samast pad main hifan na lagaaya jaae to use 'anakh' padhe jane se 'krodh' kaa arth bhi nikal saktaa he
 a-nati: Anati, a-paras: Aperus, Geo-element: Bhootmata, etc
 is the same situation for all the posts
 ye sabhi yugma vartanee or arth donon drushtiyon se bhinn-bhinn shabd hai
 2
4
4 Hyphens can also be used to avoid difficult treaties
 jaise :– dwi-akshar, dwi-arthak aadi
 2
5
1 'always', 'with' etc
 are always written separately
 jaise :– yahan tak, aapke saath
 2

2 Ah, oh, aha, ai, hee, so, so, too, neither, when, then, when, here, there, where, forever, what, sri, ji, till, across, mere, with , But, but, but, whether, or, or, and, as and etc
 are imprecise to explain many types of expressions
 kuch avyayon ke aage kaarak chihn bhi aate hai
 Like: - From now on, since, from here, from there, forever
 niyam ke anusaar avyay sadaa pruthak likhe jane chahie
 Such as: - For you only, till me, with you, full of cloth, country, overnight, all day, it should be so full, let me know, even work is not made, only fifty rupees etc
 2
5
3 sammanarthak 'shri' or 'ji' avyay bhi pruthak likhe jaaen
 Such as Shri Shri Ram, Kanhaiyalal ji, Mahatma ji etc
 2
5
4 samast padon main prati, maatr, yatha aadi avyay jodakar likhe jaaen 
 Such as - per day, percentage, man-man, constant, in due time, reasonably etc
 yah sarvavidit niyam he ki samaas na hone par samast pad ek mana jaataa he
 Therefore, it is relevant to write it together rather than writing it in busy form
 'das rupye maatr', 'maatr do vyakti' main padbandh kii rachana he
 It should be written separately only
 2
6
0 anuswaar vyanjan he or anunasikta swar kaa nasiky vikaar
 Both of these are also different in Hindi
 at hindi main anuswaar or anunasikta chihn donon hi prachlit rahenge
 2
6
1 reminders 2
6
1
1 sanskrit shabdon kaa anuswaar anyavargeey varnon se pehle yathavat rahegaa
 Such as - coincidence, protection, attachment, dialogue, kansa, violence etc
 2
6
1
2 sanyukt vyanjan ke rup main jahaan pancham varna ke baad savargeey shesh chaar varnon main se koi varna ho to ekarupata or mudran / lekhan kii suvidha ke liye anuswaar kaa hi prayog karnaa chahie
 Such as - Pankaj, Ganga, Chanchal, Stingy, Kantha, Chill, Saint, Sandhya, Temple, Editor, Relations etc
 bandhani main rakhe hue rup sanskrit ke uddharanon main hi maanya honge
 It is advisable to use Bindi in Hindi
 2
6
1
3 yadi panchamakshar ke baad kisi anya varg kaa koi varna aae to panchamakshar anuswaar ke rup main parivartit nahin hoga
 Such as: - Eloquent, other, Chinmaya, oriented etc
 2

1
4 pancham varna yadi dvitv rup main aae to pancham varna anuswaar main parivartit nahin hoga
 Like - food, conference, consent etc
 2

5 angrezi, urdu se gruhit shabdon main aadhe varna yaa anuswaar ke bhram ko dur karne ke liye nasiky vyanjan ko puraa likhnaa acha rahegaa
 Such as: - Limka, Tankhah, Tinka, Tamga, Kamasin etc
 2
6

6 sanskrit ke kuch tatsam shabdon ke ant main anuswaar kaa prayog m kaa suchak he
 Like - ego, and, but, Shiva
 2
6
2 anunasikta 2
6
2
1 Proper use of Chandrabindu in Hindi words will be mandatory
 2
6
2
2 anunasikta vyanjan nahin he, swaron kaa dhvanigun he
 In the pronunciation of resonant vowels, air also comes out of the nose
 jaise :– aan, uun, en, maan, hoon, aaen
 2
6
2
3 Without Chandrabindu there is often scope for confusion in meaning
 jaise :– hans : hans, angana : anganaa, swang : swaang aadi main
 Therefore, Chandrabindu must be used to clear such confusion
 kintu jahaan chandrabindu ke prayog se chapai aadi main bahut kathinaayee ho or chandrabindu ke sthaan par bindu kaa prayog kisi prakaar kaa bhram utpann na kare, vahaan chandrabindu ke sthaan par bindu ke prayog kii chhot rahegi
 Like: - No, I, etc
 kavita aadi ke prasang main chand kii drushti se chandrabindu kaa yathasthaan avashya prayog kiya jaae
 Similarly, in the entrances of young children, where the chandrabindu is pronounced, it should be used everywhere in thick letters
 jaise :– kahan, hansnaa, aangan, sanvaarana, main, main, nahin aadi
 2
7
1 If Sanskrit words are used in Visarga, if they are used in the corresponding form, then Visarga must be used
 jaise :– ‘duhkhanubhuti’ main
 If Visarga has been omitted in the form of that word, then without Visarga in that form it will work
 jaise :– ‘dukh-sukh ke saathi’
 2
7
2 It is mandatory to use the used clause at the end of corresponding words
 yatha :– atah, punah, swatah, praayah, purnatah, multah, antat, vastutah, kramshah aadi
 2
7
3 The dissimilar form of 'H' is immersion, so Ghosh 'H' should not be written in its place
 2
7
4 dubsahas / dussahas, nihshabd / nishshabd ke ubhay rup maanya honge
 In these, the preferred form should be given priority
 2
7
4
1 nistej, nirvachan, nishchal aadi shabdon main visarg vaala rup na likhaa jaae
 2
7
4
2 The words conscience, antipura, morning etc
 should be written with visarga
 2
7
5 tadbhav / deshi shabdon main visarg kaa prayog na kiya jaae
 It would be wrong to write six on this basis
 chah likhnaa hi thik hoga
 2
7
6 The words peninsweep, termination, etc
 are also not dissonant in the corresponding form
 2
7
7 visarg ko varna ke saath milakar likhaa jaae, jabaki colon chihn shabd se kuch duuri par ho
 Like: - So, this is how: - 2
8
1 ko hal chihn kaha jaae na ki halant
 The light mark under the consonant indicates that the consonant is void, ie the consonant is purely consonant
 is tarah se 'jagat' halant shabd kaha jayega kyonki yah shabd vyanjanant he, swarant nahin
 2
8
2 According to Rule 2
1
2
2 of making conjunctions, only the markings will be used in the thumbnail
 jaise : chihn, buddha, vidwaan aadi main
 2
8
3 When the use of corresponding words is desirable, only halant forms should be used; Especially when all words or derived words are formed from them
 yatha prak :–, vaak-, sat-, bhagwan-, saakshaat-, jagat-, tejas-, vidyut- aadi
 In the corresponding address, only Rajan, o Lord, will be accepted
 hindi style main he raja, he bhagwaan likhe jaaen
 In words in which the hallmark has been lost, do not attempt to reinstate it
 jaise - mahaan, vidwaan aadi; kyonki hindi main ab 'mahaan' se 'mahanata' or 'vidwaanon' jaise rup prachlit ho chuke hai
 2
8
4 In grammar texts, only those words which are necessary to understand the word structure or are useful in terms of meaning are given to explain consonant conjunctions
 2
8
5 hindi main hrydayngam, uddhran, sanchit aadi shabdon kaa sandhi-viched samajhane kii aavashyaktaa prathit nahin hoti
 Similarly, there is a need to explain the meaning of words like 'interview', 'jagdish', 'hexkosh' only when their treaty is cited
 hindi main inhen swatantra shabdon ke rup main grahan karnaa hi acha hoga
 2
9
1 The spelling of Sanskrit-friendly words should be taken as-is
 at: 'brahma' ko 'bramha', 'chihn' ko 'chinh', 'urin' ko 'urin' main badalanaa uchit nahin hoga
 Similarly, imprudence, sight, exhibition, excess, trespass etc
 are not acceptable inaccurate usage
 inke sthaan par kramash: gruhit, drashtavy, pradarshnee, atyadhik, anadhikaar hi likhnaa chahie
 2
9
2 The corresponding words in which a consonant consonant has disappeared in the event of a combination of three consonants is not allowed to be written
 jaise :– arddh > ardh, tatva > tatv aadi
 2
10
1 Ai, au in Hindi is used to express two types of pronunciation
 pehle prakaar kaa uccharan 'he', 'or' aadi main mul swaron kii tarah hone laga he; jabaki duusare prakaar kaa uccharan 'gavaiya', 'kauwa' aadi shabdon main sandhyaksharon ke rup main aaj bhi surakshit he
 These signs should be used to express both types of utterances
 'gavayya', 'kavva' aadi sanshodhano kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Other examples are: Bhaiya, Syed, Ready, Hawa etc
 2
10
2 dakshin ke ayyar, nayyar, ramayya aadi vyaktinaamon ko hindi uccharan ke anusaar aiyar, naiyar, ramaiya aadi na likhaa jaae, kyonki mulbhasha main iskaa uccharan bhinn he
 2
10
3 Words like avwal, qawwal, qawwali are prevalent
 inhen lekhan main yathavat rakhaa jaae
 2
10
4 In Sanskrit, the word 'bed' should not be written as 'shaya'
 2
11
1 purvakalik kridant pratyay 'kar' kriya se milakar likhaa jaae
 Such as: - By mixing, eating and drinking, crying and etc
 2
11
2 kar + kar se 'karke' or kara + kar se 'karake' banegaa
 2
12
1 In verb forms 'doer', 'coming', 'talker' etc
 should be written separately
 jaise :– main ghar jane vaala hoon, jane vaale log
 2
12
2 'gharwala', 'topiwala', Dilwala, Dudhwala etc
 will be written as one word in the form of additive suffix
 2
12
3 'vaala' jab pratyay ke rup main aayega tab to 2
12
2 ke anusaar milakar likhaa jayega; anyathaa alag se
 This is the directive word in this one, this one, the first one, the good one, the red one, the tomorrow one, etc
 atah ise alag hi likhaa jaae
 Similarly, the words with long hair girl, bearded man etc
 will be written separately
 isse ham rachana ke str par antar kar sakate hai
 Such as: -gaonwala - villager village house - village house 2
13
1 jahaan shrutimulak ya, va kaa prayog vikalp se hota he vahaan na kiya jaae, arthath kiye : kiye, nai : nayi, hua : huwa aadi main se pehle roopon kaa prayog kiya jaae
 This rule should be applied in all forms and situations of the verb, adjective, avayya etc
 jaise :– dikhaae gaye, ram ke liye, pustak liye hue, nai dilli aadi
 2
13
2 Where 'Y' is not the grammatical change but only the basic element of the word, there is no need to make optional dictative emotional change
 jaise :– sthaayee, avyayibhav, daayitv aadi 
 The words of arabic-persian origin from Urdu which have become a part of Hindi and whose foreign sounds have been converted into Hindi sounds can be accepted in Hindi only
 jaise :– kalam, kila, daag aadi 
 But where their pure use in foreign form is desired or it is necessary to state the accent, there should be in-place nukes in their prevalent forms in Hindi
 jaise :– khaanaa : kaanaa, raaj : raaj, fan : fan aadi
 In English words, where the semicircular 'O' sound is used, if the pure form is used in Hindi, the crescent moon should be used over the quantity of 'A'
 jahaan tak angrezi or anya videshi bhashaaon se nae shabd grahan karne or unke devanagari lipyantaran kaa sambandh he, agast-sitambar, 1962 main vaigyanik tathaa takneekee shabdaawalee ayog dwaara vaigyanik shabdaawalee par yojit bhashavidon kii sangoshtee main antarrashtriya shabdaawalee ke devanagari lipyantaran ke sambandh main kii gai sifaarish ullekhneey he
 It states that Devanāgarī transliteration of English words should not be so eloquent that many new signs have to be added to its present Devanāgarī characters
 angrezi shabdon kaa devanagari lipyantaran maanak angrezi uccharan ke adhik-se-adhik nikat hona chahie
 There are some popular words in Hindi that have two forms of spelling being the same
 vidvatsamaj main donon roopon kii ek-si manyata he
 Some examples are: neck / neck, heat / heat, ice / ice, absolutely / absolutely, cold / cold, pedestal / chair, conscription / recruitment, leisure / leisure, tolerance / tolerance, back / back, finally / finally, utensils / Utensils, again / again, shop / shop, sickness / disease etc
 in vaikalpik roopon main se pehle vaale rup ko praathamikta di jaae
 For details see - Appendix 4 2
15
1 shirorekha kaa prayog prachlit rahegaa
 2
15
2 Except for fullstop, the rest of the punctuation marks are the same as those prevalent in English
 yatha :– -, –, :–, , ;, :, ?, !, ', " ", ' ' 
, { },, 


, / 
 For detailed rules, see Appendix - 5 2
15
3 visarg ke chihn ko hi colon kaa chihn maan liya gaya he
 But the difference has been made between the two that Visarga should be at a distance from the word and colon
 2
15
4 purna viraam ke liye khadi pai kaa hi prayog kiya jaae
 Not the point at the end of the sentence
 thos jyamiti main chaar samtal falkon vaale thos ko chatushfalki kehete hai
 The four faces are triangular

 There are four panels, four heads and six cores
 saadhaaran uttal bahufalakiyon main chatushfalki hi sabase saral thos he
 The tetrahedron is a type of pyramid whose base is a triangle
 atah ise 'tribhujiya pyramid' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Like all convex polyflies, the tetrahedron can also be made by bending it with a single piece of paper
 kisi bhi chatushfalki ke chaaron shirshon se hokar ek gol tal banaaya ja saktaa he, jise parigola kehete hai
 In the same way, a round floor can be made by touching all the four faces which is called endola
 jis chatushfalak ke sabhi falak sambahu tribhuj hon, use samachatushfalak kehete hai
 Tetrahedron volume jahaan b { \ displaystyle B} chatushfalak ke aadhaar kaa kshetrafal tathaa h { \ displaystyle h} is aadhaar par saamne ke sheersh se daale gaye lamb kii lambaai he
 v = 1 6 | det | { \ displaystyle v = { \ frac {1} {6}} \ left | det \ right |} where A, B, c and d are the vertices of the quadrilateral
 yadi kisi samachatushfalak ke kor kii lambaai 'a' ho to : Is known Note that with respect to the base plane the slope of a face is twice that of an edge, corresponding to the fact that the horizontal distance covered from the base to the apex along an edge is twice that along the median of a face
 In other words, if c is the centroid of the base, the distance from c to a vertex of the base is twice that from c to the midpoint of an edge of the base
 This follows from the fact that the medians of a triangle intersect at its centroid, and this point divides each of them in two segments, one of which is twice as long as the other
