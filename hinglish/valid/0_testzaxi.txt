 After the defeat of the King of Warangal at the hands of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, Bukk and his brother were taken captive and sent to Delhi

 The following were the reasons for the American Civil War- sanyukt rajya america ke uttari rajyon kii sthiti jananaankeey evam aarthik drushti se apekshaakrit majboot thi
 Out of the 34 states of the Union, 23 states were included in the north and 2 / 3 of the total population of the country lived in the north, with a very small number of slaves
 uttari rajyon main udyogon kii pradhanta thi
 In industries, cotton, woolen garments, leather goods etc
 were produced on a large scale
 in kaarkaanon main mazdooron dwaara mashiinon se utpaadan hota tha, atah yahaan gulaamon evam daason kaa vishesh mahatv nahin tha
 On the other hand, the economic life of the southern states of America was based on agriculture and there was not much use of machines in agriculture
 atah in rajyon ke kisaan kheti ke liye gulaamon ke shram par nirbhar the
 In the south, cotton, sugarcane and tobacco were cultivated on a large scale in which slaves worked as laborers
 atah dakshin kaa samaaj purna rup se daason par nirbhar tha
 In this way, the southern state was distinguished from the northern and western parts due to its characteristics, the prevalent slave system and plantation system prevalent there
 dakshini rajya-varjeenia se lekar dakshini carolina hote hue georgia tak ek pattee ke rup main faile the
 Thus, due to economic disparity, there was a big difference in economic life, political ideology and social status of the northern and southern states
 uttari america ke rajya udyog pradhan the faltah vahaan navdith udyopatiyon ne videshi pratisparddha se bachane hetu sangrakshan kii maang kii
 Industries were patronized by the American Union with their interests in mind
 kintu is kadam se dakshin ke rajyon ko aapatti thi
 Because of the policy of conservation, they now got manufactured goods at a relatively expensive price
 atah unhen yah mahasoos hua ki sangh kaa prayog uttari america ke hiton ke liye kiya ja rahaa he or dakshini rajyon ke prati upeksha kii drushti rakhi ja rahi he
 In the northern states of America, slaves had no decisive role in economic life
 atah unke liye daason kaa mahatv gaun tha duusari taraf america ke dakshini rajyon main das pratha janajivan main ghul chuki thi
 In the southern states, the issue of slavery was always sensitive
 jab kabhi anya rajyon me das pratha par lage pratibandh ko in dakshini, rajyon main lagu karne kii uthi to in rajyon ne ise apni prabhusatta par akraman mana
 In fact, slavery was seen as a stigma on humanity in the northern states and the demand to abolish it was raised
 samachar-patron main madhyam se is das virdohi bhaavana ko ubhaara gaya
 On the other hand the issue of slaves for the southern states was linked to profitability
 unka tark tha ki das pratha main shramik sanghathanon, hadataalon aadi kaa bhay nahin tha tathaa uttari rajyon ke mazdooron kii tulana main ve daason ko adhik suvidha pradaan karte hai
 On the basis of this mindset and arguments, the southern states considered slavery to be necessary
 uttari-america main to das vyapaar samaapt kar diya gaya tha or das pratha uttar main pencilvenia kii dakshini seemaa tak band ho gai thi
 This boundary line was called the "mesum-dixon" boundary
 ab america kaa pashchimi kshetron main vistaar ho rahaa tha or nae-nae kshetra sanyukt rajya america main shaamil kiye ja rahe the
 In such a situation a question arose whether these states should be included as a slave state or as an independent state
 yah mudda isliye bhi mahatvapurn tha kyonki samvidhan main yah sweekaar kiya gaya tha ki sangheey vyavasthapika main daason kii gananaa bhi hoti thi kintu daason kii jansankhya ko 3 / 5 ke ausat main pratinidhitiv diya jaataa tha arthath daason kii jansankhya yadi 500 hogi to use 300 maanakar pratinidhitiv diya jane laga
 Thus, with the increase in the number of slave states, there was a danger of increasing the dominance of slave states in the administration
 isliye naveen rajyon ke vilay ke sandarbh main uttari america use swatantra rajya ke rup main shaamil karnaa chahta tha jabaki dakshini rajya use das rajya ke rup main
 The dispute deepened over the merger of the state of Missouri
 atah 1820 i
 main henry clay kii madhyasthata se mizori-samjhauta sampann hua
 Under this, Missouri was incorporated into the Union as a slave state and it was stated that slavery would not continue in Louisiana, an area north of 36030 'latitude
 iske baad sangh main texas ke vilay kaa prastaav aayaa
 Texas eventually joined the Union in 1845 as a slave state
 phir california ke mudde par vivaad hua or antat california ko 1850 main swatantra rajya ke rup main sammilit kiya gaya
 It was fiercely opposed in the southern states
 ab unhen santusht karne ke liye ek “bhagoda das” kanoon laayaa gaya jiske tahat bhaage hue das ko punah pakadaa ja saktaa tha
 This law was opposed by the northern states as they gave shelter to fugitive slaves
 kintu 1854 main cansus evam nebraska ke vilay ke prashn ne vivaad ko or gaharaa diya
 In fact, these two states were located 30 degrees 30 minutes north and according to the Missouri Accord they were to be included as independent states, but with the effort of a politician named Stephen Douglas, these states were incorporated as slave states
 is tarah rajyon ke vilay ke prashn ne uttari evam dakshini rajyon ke madhya khai ko or chaudaa kar diya
 In 1860, the Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won and in 1861 he assumed the position of President
 republican party ne das pratha kii aalochana kii thi or yah party swatantra shram vichaardhaara main vishwaas rakhti thi
 Lincoln's victory, therefore, seemed inauspicious to the southern states
 unhen laga ki yah jeet dakshin ke aarthik hiton ke anukool nahin he
 So the first reaction in the southern states was made by the state of Carolina and it announced its separation from the Union
 farvari, 1861 tak mississippi, florida, albama, georgia, lulasiana va texas ne bhi sangh se viched kar jeffrasan davis ko apana raashtrapati niyukt kiya or isi ke saath grihayuddh kii shuruuaat ho gai, jab dakshini carolina se sumter ke kile par bam phenk sangh ke viruddh yuddh ched diya
 The separation of the Union by the Southern States raised an important constitutional question whether the Southern States had the right to secede from the Union? Lincoln, after his election to the presidency, declared unequivocally that the union that was established as the United States of America was unbroken and eternal, that its indefensibility would not be allowed to be destroyed in any way
 america samvidhan nirmaataaon ne kisi rajya ko sangh se pruthak hone kaa adhikaar nahin diya he
 Lincoln declared that "if we can save the union by freeing all slaves, we will do so if we can save the union without freeing slaves, and we will do so if by freeing some slaves and not freeing others If we can save the union, we will do that too
 " is tarah linkan ne sangh ko bachaae rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 During the war, it did not allow the southern states to have relations with foreign countries through diplomatic skill
 usne senaaon ko sangathit kar dakshin ke sashastr sangharsh kii chunauti ko todaa
 From the very beginning, he said that the main goal of the armies was not to take authority over the southern region, but to expand the armies of the Confederation
 1861 i
 main linkan ne das vyavastha kaa unmoolan kar diya or unhen rashtriya senaaon main sammilit hone ke liye aamantrit kiya
 But its purpose was not to destroy the southern states but to maintain the Union
 uskaa maananaa tha ki daason kii swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa se dakshin ke rajyon main daason kaa vidroh hoga or yuddh main unhen daason kii sahaayta nahin mil paaegi
 Finally, through the efforts and diplomacy of Lincoln, the northern states were conquered, and with this the civil war ended in 1865 AD
 linkan ne america kaa yatharth rup main sanyukt rashtriya nirmaan kiya
 Abolished slavery, rejuvenated society and strengthened the American political system
 parantu grihayuddh ke pashchaat america ko vah aage nahin badha sakaa kyonki raajnneetik tantra ko majboot banaaya
 But after the Civil War he could not advance America because he was assassinated on 15 April 1865 by John Viscus Booth
 sanyukt rajya america ke itihaas main america grihayuddh ne ek pradhan mode kaa kaary kiya
 Although there was a huge loss of life and property during the war, a sense of mutual hatred, economic chaos ensued, hurting the lifestyle of the southern states
 kintu yah bhi satya he ki afratfari or avyavashtha ek shalya chiktsa ke samaan thi jiske uparaant ek swasth, viksit or ekikrut sanyukt rajya america kaa nirmaan hua
 In this context, Prof
 Elson stated that "the war was a surgery that, despite being painful, became untold blessing for the United States
" " The civil war brought dramatic changes in national and regional power relations
 lambe samay se chale aa rahe prantiy evam sangheey rajyon ke adhikaron ke vivaad ko sulajhaa diya
 They were rejoined in the Union after the surrender of the southern states
 iskaa taatpary tha ki rajyon kaa sangh purvavat bana rahegaa or bhavishya main phir kabhi algaavvaad ke adhikaar kii baat nahin uthegi
 In fact, the outcome of the civil war resolved the constitutional question that states do not have the right to secede from the Union
 is tarah samvidhan main varnit “avinashi rajyon kaa avinashi sangh” ke siddhanth kii pushti hui
 Now politically America was given the form of a real United Nations

 As a result, corruption increased and in some parts the moral standard of the society fell
 grihayuddh ko america main ek pramukh audyogic raashtra bana dene vaali saamaajik-aarthik utperrak shakti ke rup main dekha gaya
 In this context, Charles and Manny Beard called this civil war as America's 'second revolution'

 The capitalists who made huge profits by investing money in war and by contracting the supply of goods for the army, used this money to exploit the natural wealth of the nation

 Extensive industrialization and urbanization expanded the role of women

 Women education got a boost which improved their standard of living

 motaa paath Chichen Itza or Chichen Itza was a large city built by the Mayan civilization in the pre-columbus era
 chichen itza, uttar shastreey se hote hue antim shastreey main or aarambhik uttarshastreey kaal ke aarambhik bhaag main uttari maaya kii tarai main ek pramukh centre tha
 The site showcases a variety of architectural styles, including a style known as "mechanized" and a style reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico, between the puck maya of the northern Terai
 The presence of central Mexican styles was once known to represent direct migration or conquest of central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations see the presence of these non-mayan styles as a result of cultural diffusion
 chichen itza ke khandhar sangheey sampatti hai or us sthal kaa prabandhan mexico ke Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The land under the monuments was privately owned until 29 March 2010, when it was purchased by the Yuktan state
 yash deore made it The name Maya "chich'n Itza" means "at the mouth of Itza's well
" It is derived from the word chi, meaning "mouth" or "mouth" and chen, meaning "well" Itza is the name of an ethnic-dynasty group that gained political and economic dominance over the North Peninsula
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah naam maaya ke itz se liya gaya he, jiskaa arth he "jaadu" or á kaa arth he "pani
" spanish main itzá kaa arth hota he "brujas del Agua " lekin iskaa ek or adhik sateek anuwaad he jal ke jaadugar
 When translating this name into Spanish and from Spanish to other languages, it is often introduced as Chichén Itzá 'to indicate that the last syllable of both parts of the name is emphasized
 anya sandarbhon main adhik kathor vartanee kaa prayog kiya gaya he jisamen is shabd ko Chich'en Itzá kaa prayog karte hue maaya bhashaa ke anusaar likhaa gaya he

 "itzá" shabd main antim "a" par ek ucch vruddhi he jiske baad kanthiy avrodh he 
 There is evidence in the Chilam Balam books that there was another name for the city before the arrival of the Itza dominion in northern Yucatán

 jabaki adhikansh log is baat se sahamat hai ki pehle shabd kaa arth saat he, baaki ke sateek anuwaad ko lekar kaaphi bahes he
 Suggested translations include "seven bushes", "seven great houses," or "seven lines of abanal
" uttari yuctan shushk he or uske andruni bhaag main sabhi nadiyaan bhumigat hai
 There are two large, natural sink pits called the cenote, which would have supplied water to Chichen throughout the year and made it an attractive place to settle
 Of the two cenotes, the "cenote Sagrado" or Sacred Cenote, is the most famous
 vijay-pashchaat sutron ke anusaar, purv-colombian maaya, senot main maaya ke varsha devtaa chaak kii puja ke nimitt vastuon or manushyon kaa balidaan dete the
 Edward Herbert Thompson dredged Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910 and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery, and incense sticks as well as human remains

 Chichen Itza became regionally important at the end of the early classical period
 tathaapi, uttar shastreey kaal ke ant main or antim shastreey kaal kii shuruyaat main hi yah site ek pramukh kshetreey rajdhani ban gaya, jahaan se isane uttari maaya kii tarai main raajnneetik, saamaajik-saanskrithik, aarthik or vaicharik jivan ko kendriyakrut karnaa or prabhavit karnaa shuru kiya
 The origins of Chichen Itza are largely correlated with the decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the lowlands of the southern Maya, such as with Tikal
 kuch ethnohistoric sutron kaa daawa he ki lagbhag 987 main ek toltech raja jiskaa naam topiltagin se akatal quetzalkotal tha vah kendriya mexico kii sena ke saath yahaan pahunchaa or usne chichen itza ko apni rajdhani or ek doosraa tula banaaya
 is avadhi kii kala or vaastukala main maaya or toltech shaileyon kaa ek rochak mishran dekhne ko miltaa he
 However, the recent rescheduling of the decline of Chichen Itza indicates that Chichen Itza is largely a north / final classical site, while Libra is an early classical-postwar site
 1980 ke dashak ke ant main kai puratatvavidon ne suzav diya ki praarambhik shastreey kaal kii pichhali maaya rajaniti ke vipareet, chichen itza ho saktaa he kisi ek vyakti dwaara yaa ek ekal rajshahi vansh dwaara shasit nahin tha
 Instead, the political organization of the city would have been structured by a mulattepal system, understood as governance through a council composed of members of the elite ruling class
 yah siddhant 1990 ke dashak main lokapriy tha, lekin haal ke varshon main, jis anusandhan ne "multapele" pranali kii avadharana kaa samarthan kiya tha us par sawaal khadey kiye gaye
 The current belief in Maya related knowledge is more towards the traditional model of the Maya Empire of the southern Terai of the classical period
 chichen itza apane charam kaal ke dauraan uttari maaya tarai kshetra main ek pramukh aarthik shakti tha
 By participating in the water-based sarcome-peninsular trade route through its port site in Isla Cerritos, Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from remote areas, such as central Mexico and southern Central America
 maaya itihaas ke anusaar, hunaak sil, maayaapan ke shaasha ne 13veen sadi main chichen itza par vijay praapt kii
 mana jaataa he ki hunaak sil ne satta main apane udai kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 According to the tradition at the time, individuals who were thrown into the cenote Sagrado were believed to have predictive power in the event of their survival
 aise hi ek samaaroh ke dauraan, itihaas main charchaa he ki koi vyakti jivit nahin bachaa, isliye hunaak sil senot sagrado main kud gaya or jab hataaya gaya to usne apane udai kii bhavishyavaanee kii
 While there exists some archaeological evidence indicating that Chichen Itza was looted and ravaged at one time, there is more evidence suggesting that it was not by Mayapan, at least not when Chichen Itza Was an active urban center
 puratathvik data darshaate hai ki chichen itza, maayaapan ke udai se do sadi pehle, kareeb 1000 i
 main nasht ho gaya
 Ongoing research at Mayapan's site may help solve this chronological puzzle
 jabaki chichen itza "dhah" gaya aisa prathit nahin hota he ki ise puri tarah se chhod diya gaya
 According to post-conquest sources, Cenot Sagrado remained a pilgrimage place for both Spanish and Maya
 1526 main spanish kancstador francisco di montejo ne safaltaapurvak spain ke raja ko yuctan ko jeetne ke liye arji di

 Montejo returned to Yucatán in 1531 with a contingent and established his main base at Kompeche on the west coast
 In late 1532 he sent his son, Francisco Montejo the Younger, to conquer the interior areas of the Yucatán Peninsula from the north
 The aim was to visit Chichen Itza from the beginning and to establish a capital
 montejo da yangar antat chichen itza pahunchaa, jise usne ek nayaa naam siyudad rial diya

 1534 main raat ke andhere main use chichen itza kaa parityag karne par majaboor hona padaa
 1535 tak, sabhi spanish logon ko yuctan prayadweep se nikaal diya gaya
 Montejo eventually returned to Yucatán and formed a huge indo-spanish army, recruiting Maya from Champoton and Campeche and conquering the peninsula
 The Spanish king then issued a land grant which included Chichen Itza and by 1588 it became a pasture for cattle

 These buildings were formerly connected by a dense network of paved roads, called saqbiob
 puratatvavidon ko kareeb 100 sackbiob mili hai jo is sthaan par faile hai or shahar se sabhi dishaao main gaye hai
 The buildings of Chichen Itza are classified in a series of architectural sets and each set was once distinguished from the other set by a series of small walls
