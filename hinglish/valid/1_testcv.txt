 Yes, knowing this truth, you too will be forced to think that if India will study in this way, how will India grow? The news is from Uttar Pradesh, where the Master of Council, ie primary and middle schools, will only teach children
 Work is not taken up, but so many different government and other tasks are imposed on them, due to which most of their time is spent in these works and the education of children is affected
 There is financial
 aise halaat main agar ye kaha jaeuttar pradesh ke sarkari skulonki padhai bhagwaan bharose hi chal rahi he to koi galat baat nahin hogi
 When we reached a school in Mughalsarai in eastern Uttar Pradesh, we came to know that many teachers did not come here because they have been engaged in voter revision work and they are working from house to house to revise the voter list
 aapako yah jaankaar hairaani hogi ki jin adhyapakon kii niyukti bacchon koshikshadhene ke liye kii gai he unase koun koun se sarkari kaam liye jate hai
 From census, counting and child counting to voter revision and feeding of socialist pension, teachers are engaged in nutrition mission
 darasal upi main vidhaan sabha or nagar nikaay chunaav hone hai or aise main sarkaar ke saamne matadaata suchi kii jaanch karne or thik kar lene kii chunauti he
 Due to this, the work of voter revision is going on vigorously in the entire state of Uttar Pradesh and teachers have been engaged in this work in all the districts
 aisi haalat main adhyapakon kaa ek bada hissaa voter list ke punarreekshan ke kaam main lag gaya he
 It is obvious that due to this, children's education will be interrupted
 harek skool kaa alam he ki vahaan par naam maatr ke adhyaaapak bache hai jo bacchon ko kisi tarah se padhaane kaa korum puraa kar rahe hai
 DM said- After school time, do this work, Teachers Chandauli DM Kumar Prashant said that first of all, our priority was not to put teachers in this work
 anya vibhaagon ke logon ko lagaaya jaae lekin uske baad bhi hamaare yahaan bielo kii sankhya puri nahin ho paa rahi thi
 There we have engaged teachers and they have been given clear instructions to do the reading work in school time and then to do their bills from one to 5-6
 jisase pathan pathan kaa kaam prabhavit na ho or bielo kaa kaam bhi sucharu rup se chalata rahe
 Vikas Mankatla, lead actor of the TV serial Namah: has left the show in just one month
 sho main wo bhagwaan shiv ke kirdaar main najar aa rahe the
 Meanwhile, the show storyline was changed
 pehle jahaan sho main mahadev or bhagwaan vishnu kii dosti dikhaai ja rahi thi
 Now the show has been shifted to Lord Vishnu only
 sho kaa naam ab nam: se lakshmi narayan kar diya gaya he
 What image did she leave on leaving the show? Soon after Vikas quit, the news came that the actress image (actress playing Parvati in the show) has also left the show
 ab is puure masale par actress ne baatcheet kii he
 Speaking to Spotboy, the actress said- 'according to whatever development is going on in the show, i don't think i have any special growth in the show
 sho kaa pehle concept mahadev or vishnu kii dosti par tha
 Unfortunately the audience could not connect to it and got a useless TRP
 uske baad creative team kii taraf se kol liya gaya ki sho vishnu par shift kar diya gaya he
 The show did not have much scope for the character of Mahadev and Mera Parvati

 Therefore, the decision of demonetisation is very important and this will put a check on terrorism in South Asia region
 sutron ne daawa kiya he ki bharat main philhal sanchalit 50 rupee, 500 rupee or 2000 rupee kii nai karency kii hoobahoo nakal nikaalane kii taiyaari main juta he
 For this purpose, he is buying India's banned currency through Nepal in large numbers

 In an interview with Michael Holding on Sony Live, Kohli said, "people talk about practice matches, but the important question is where are these matches happening and what is the bowling attack of the opposing team
 ’unhone kaha, ‘yaditestasiries se pehle jaruri taiyaari nahin mil paati hai to in maichon ke koi myne nahin he
 Practice matches are useful only when a good opposing team is in front

 The figures of GDP of the Narendra Modi government at the Center have been making huge claims on the economy
 notebandi or jiesti lagu hone se desh kii jidipi main bada ghota laga he, to sarkaar kaa kahana he ki notebandi kaa isse koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 If we go back a little, then when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was debating in Parliament after demonetisation was implemented, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had warned the government about this
 lagata he manmohan kii chetavanee sach sabit ho rahi he
 
 rajyasabha main kya bole the manmohan?notebandi par charchaa ke dauraan nanvabar 2016 main rajyasabha main manmohan singh ne saaf kaha tha ki notebandi bhartiya arthvyavastha ke liye khatra he
 This may weaken the economy, while GDP may fall by 2 per cent
 purv piem ne sidhaa waar karte hue kaha tha ki main piem modi se poochna chahta hum ki vah kisi aise desh kaa naam bataaen, jahaan logon ne bank main apane paisa jamaa karaae hai lekin ve use nikaal nahin sakate
 Changing rules, your failure every day! Manmohan Singh said in Rajya Sabha that people's trust in the currency system has decreased, farmers and small industrialists have also suffered big losses
 sarkaar har din nae niyam bana rahi he, jo ki saaf darshata he ki PMO is faisle ko lagu karwaane main asafal rahaa
 The PM has asked for 50 days for this, but it is not easy for a poor person to suffer 50 days of pain
 notebandi: manmohan rajyasabha main bolte rahe, PM modi sunate rahe, kiye ye 12 bade varasach hui manmohan singh kii baat!chaalu vitt varsh kii june main khatm hui timahi ke dauraan desh kii jidipi kii vruddhi dar main giravat darj kii gai he

 That is, there has been a steady decline in GDP since demonetisation
 ek saal main jidipi 7
 Falling from 9 to 5
 7 fisad par aa pahunchi he
 In these 4 points, understand the demonetization connection of the decline in GDP! Modi had given this answer PM Modi had also answered Manmohan Singh's questions during the discussion on the President's address
 modi ne waar karte hue kaha tha ki manmohan singh ji purv piem hai, aadarneey hai
 He has had a direct relationship with India's economic decisions for the last 30-35 years
 aadha samay unka hi dabadabaa tha, aisa desh main koi nahin rahaa hoga
 But we can learn from the politician Manmohan Singh
 manmohan par kabhi koi daag nahin laga
 Taking a bath in the bathroom wearing a raincoat, no one knows this art except Manmohanji
 bataa den ki centre sarkaar ne puraane kar dhaanche ko khatm kar 1 july se jiesti lagu kiya he
 Economic experts believe that it is only because of the new tax structure and the effects of GST that GDP is steadily declining
 bathroom main renkot pahanakar nahaana koi manmohan se siikhe: modi The Supreme Court, which is hearing a case of police action under the IT Act for posting objectionable posts on social media, raised several questions on the central government on Wednesday
 court ne kaha ki agar post karne vaale ko tres nahin kiya ja saktaa to phir niyam banane kii kya zarurat he
 During the hearing, the court had asked if the objectionable poster could be identified, and DG Gulshan Rai of the Computer Emergency Response Team, appearing for the central government, told the court that it was difficult in the new technology, because its For hidden servers are used and most of the servers are abroad, so it can be detected from which computer to post Or has been, but the poster cannot be identified
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki europe ke desh is maamle main jaankaree nahin dete hai, jisase mushkilen or bad jaati he, haalanki sarkaar in deshon se baat kar rahi he ki ve jaankaree saajha karen
 It was also said to show the demo in front of the court by posting it on the computer
 iske baad maamle kii sunwaayee kar kahi supreme court kii bench ne chintaa vyakt karte hue kaha ki agar post karne vaale tak pahunchaa nahin ja saktaa to phir is maamle main nae niyam banane kii kavayad kaa kya phayda he

 Delhi did not get the state, but the account of who would rule was clear today
 leftinent governor ke sahare dilli sarkaar na chalane dene kaa jo khel do saal se chalaa he, us khel ko sahi tehraane ke tamaam tarkon ke kankal aapako tivi channelon ke archive main mil jaaenge
 With the decision of the constitution bench of the Supreme Court, there may be those who say nothing that can change, those who still believe that the game will still be played in Delhi on the pretext of the Governor, sometimes with the trick of ending the membership of the mlas
 phir bhi lambey samay ke liye dilli ke sanvaidhanik aasmaan par chai dhundh chant gai he
 Now Delhi's time will not be wasted on the question whether the Chief Minister will run the government or the Lieutenant Governor
 pichley do saal se yahi lagata rahaa ki leftinent garvanar hi sarkaar hai or chun kar aae mukhyamantri unki sarkaar ke saamne maatr fariyadi
 Previously it was explained that the Chief Minister would have to work according to LG, but the Constitution Bench of five judges has clearly stated that the elected government is important in democracy, therefore, the Council of Ministers has the authority to take decisions
 bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish deepak mishra, justise eke sikri, justise eem khanvilakar, justise chandrachud or justise ashok bhushan kii khandpeeth ne bahumat se faisla dete hue kaha ki he ki dilli ke uparajyapal prashaasak hai, rajyapal nahin hai
 The court said, the Lieutenant Governor does not have the authority to take his own decision
 uparajyapal ke paas prashasan kaa swatantra adhikaar nahin he
 The Lt
 Governor cannot obstruct the decision-making process of the Cabinet
 uparajyapal un shaktiyon ko nahin hadap sakate jo samvidhan main unhen nahin di gai he
 Lt
 Governor's consent is not necessary in every case
 rajya ko bina kisi dakhal ke kaam karne kii azaadi ho
 The Lieutenant Governor should work in a good manner with the Council of Ministers
 uparajyapal or cabinet ke bich raay ke antar ko aapasi charchaa se sulajhaayen
 The Lieutenant Governor will not send all matters to the President in a mechanical way
 uparajyapal masini tareeke se faislon ko nahin roak sakate hai
 Government representatives should be respected
 is faisle ke baad uparajyapal ke dimaag main yah baat saaf ho jaani chahie ki ve dilli ke uparajyapal to hai magar dilli unki nahin hai
 The public has not elected him, rather he knows better how he was elected
 do-do uparajyapalon ke zarie dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar ko garvanar ke maatahat kaam karne vaali sarkaar banane kaa khel khelaa gaya he
 Hopefully players will play some other game now, this one will stop
 supreme court ke faisle se saaf hota he ki dilli kii janata ne india get par tafarih karte hue vidhayakon ko nahin chunaa tha ki vot denge raajnneetik dal ko or raaj karenge uparajyapal
 The Supreme Court today said that the central government has authority over land, police and law and order
 in maamalon ko chhodkar leftinent governor ko dilli sarkaar kii raay maanane ke liye baadhya hai
 Are obliged to seek his help
 dilli sarkaar ko anya maamalon main kanoon banane or prashasan karne kii ijazat di jaani chahie
 Flip the book of the constitution, the Supreme Court said what is said in the Constitution literally
 239 e main saaf saaf likhaa he ki uparajyapal ko un vishyon ke sambandh main jinaki babat vidhansabha ko vidhi banane kii shakti he, apane krityon kaa prayog karne main sahaayta or salaah dene ke liye ek mantriparishad hogi jo vidhansabha kii kul sadsy sankhya ke 10 pratishat se andhik sadasyon se milakar banegi
 Whose chief will be the chief minister
 mantriparishad vidhansabha ke prati samuhik rup se uttaradaayi hogi
 i do not know which book of the Constitution the lieutenant governor had read in which it was written that the Chief Chief Minister would be the Lieutenant Governor
 aaj supreme court ne samvidhan peeth ne samvidhan kii sahi kitaab or sahi vyakhya pakadaa di he
 There was a lot of controversy about the files
 haal hi main alji ke daftar main mukhyamantri, upmukhyamantri ne dharna diya tha, uparajyapal milane tak nahin aae
 It has been written in the judgment that in case of differences on any issue, the Lieutenant Governor could not keep the file with him, he would have to send it to the President and these differences should not be on minor issues
 faisle main ek jagah saaf-saaf likhaa he ki mantriparishad dwaara liye gaye kaaryakari faisle par up rajyapal ko paryaapt shakti he ki asahmati kii sthiti main raashtrapati ke paas vichaar ke liye bhej den, lekin sanvaidhanik yojana yah kabhi nahin kahati he ki mantriparishad ko apane faisle ke liye uparajyapal kii sahmati leni hogi
 The Vidhan Sabha represents the vote of the elected representatives, their vote and judgment should be respected at all times
 up rajyapal ko sabhi faisle or prastaavon kii soochna di jaani chahie, taaki samvaad bana rahe, lekin is samvaad kaa yah matlab nahin he ki uparajyapal kii manzuri leni he
 There is only one constitution
 usamen likhi hui baaten bhi sthaayee rup se chhapi hai
 Even after this, there is a difference of ground between the interpretation of the Delhi High Court in August 2016 and the interpretation of the Supreme Court in 2018 two years ago
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki samvidhan kii samaj main itnaa antar aa saktaa he
 In his judgment dated 4 August 2016, Justice Jayant Nath has written that the Delhi Government maintains that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is obliged to accept the assistance and advice of the Council of Ministers, in those cases in which the Legislative Assembly provides (3) (a) of 239A Has the right to make laws under isamen koi dam nahin he or sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 i also want to show you the headlines of the newspapers of that time so that you, the audience, basically understand that the interpretation of the constitution also depends on the judges' own understanding
 varanaa yah kaise ho saktaa he ki supreme court kii samvidhan peeth bhi maanati he ki dilli union terrytory he, hoicourt bhi maanata he ki dilli union territary he
 But the High Court says that LG is the boss, the Supreme Court says that the Chief Minister is the boss
 tippaniyan Look at all these headlines, remember those days when it was shown in the TV debate and it was published in the newspapers that the head of the elected government of Delhi does not have any status
 hoicourt ke faisle main likhaa he ki services ke maamle main leftinent governor kend sarkaar kii tarah act kar sakate hai
 It is said in the Supreme Court's decision that apart from the three four cases in which Delhi Legislative Assembly does not have the authority, there is no interference from the Lieutenant Governor
 ve prashaasak hai, rajyapal nahi hai
 Delhi cannot be given the status of state, this decision has been given by the earlier constitution bench and also by this constitution bench, but after today's decision, the boundary of the Lieutenant Governor has been cleared
 mukhyamantri ko mukhyamantri hone kaa adhikaar mila he
 Whenever Arvind Kejriwal protested against this interference, he succumbed to the propaganda that he was not working for Delhi
 bahaane bana rahe hai
 Now it became clear that the work that was to be done was not being allowed to be done, and what it was not to do, it was trying to do or the work was not allowed to happen
 pichley do saal se yahi lagata rahaa ki leftinent garvanar hi sarkaar hai or chun kar aae mukhyamantri unki sarkaar ke saamne maatr fariyadi

 Now it became clear that the work that was to be done was not being allowed to be done, and what it was not to do, it was trying to do or the work was not allowed to happen
 court ne kaha, uparajyapal ke paas khud faisale lene kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The Lt
 Governor does not have independent authority to administer
 uparajyapal mantrimandal ke faisle lene kii prakriya main baadha nahin daal sakate
 Lt
 Governors cannot usurp powers not given to them in the Constitution
 har maamle main uparajyapal kii sahmati zaruri nahin he
 The state should have the freedom to work without any interference
 uparajyapal ko mantriparishad ke saath sadbhaavnapurna tareeke se kaam karnaa chahie
 Resolve the difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the Cabinet by mutual discussion
 uparajyapal mecanical tareeke se saare maamle raashtrapati ko nahin bhejenge
 Lieutenant governors cannot stop decisions in a mechanized manner
 sarkaar ke pratinidhiyon ko sammaan diya janaa chahie
 After this decision, it should be clear in the mind of the Lieutenant Governor that he is the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi but Delhi is not his
 janata ne unhen nahin chunaa he, balki unka chunaav kaise hua he, ye behatar vahi jaanate hai
 Through two Lieutenant Governors, the elected government of Delhi has played the game of forming a government that works under the Governor
 ummid he khilaadi ab kuch doosraa khel khelenge, ye vaala band kar denge
 It is clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the people of Delhi did not choose the mlas while voting at India Gate that the political party will vote and the Lt
 Governor will rule
 supreme court ne aaj kaha ki bhoomi, police or kanoon vyavastha par kend sarkaar kaa adhikaar he
 Barring these matters, the Lieutenant Governor is obliged to accept the opinion of the Delhi Government
 uski madad lene ke liye baadhya hai
 The Delhi government should be allowed to enact and administer laws in other matters
 samvidhan kii kitaab palatie, supreme court ne vahi kaha jo samvidhan main shabdash kaha gaya he
 239A clearly states that the Lieutenant Governor shall have a Council of Ministers to assist and advise in the exercise of its functions in respect of those matters in respect of which the Legislative Assembly has the power to legislate, which shall be 10 percent of the total strength of the Assembly
 Consists of not more members
 jiskaa pradhan mukhyamantri hoga
 The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly
 pataa nahin leftinent governor ne samvidhan kii koun si kitaab pard lee thi, jisamen likhaa tha ki pradhan mukhyamantri uparajyapal hoga
 Today the Supreme Court has held the Constitution Bench holding the correct book and correct interpretation of the Constitution
 filon ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 Recently, the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister had staged a sit-in in the LG office, the Lt
 Governor did not even come
 is faisle main likhaa he ki kisi mudde par matbhed hone par uparajyapal apane paas file nahin rakh sakate the, unhen raashtrapati ke paas bhejnaa hoga or ye matbhed chote mote mudde par nahin hone chahie
 One place in the judgment clearly states that the Executive Governor has enough power over the executive decision taken by the Council of Ministers to send it to the President for consideration in case of disagreement, but the Constitutional Plan does not say that the Council of Ministers should make its decisions
 For this the consent of the Lt
 Governor has to be obtained
 vighansabha chune hue pratinidhiyon ke mat kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, unke mat or faisle kaa har haal main sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 All decisions and proposals should be communicated to the Lieutenant Governor, so that the dialogue remains, but this communication does not mean that the Lieutenant Governor has to be approved
 ek hi samvidhan he
 The things written in it are also permanently printed
 iske baad bhi do saal pehle agast 2016 main dilli hoicourt kii vyakhya or 2018 main supreme court kii vyakhya main zamin aasmaan kaa antar he
 How can it be so that there can be such a difference in the understanding of the Constitution
 4 agast 2016 ke apane faisle main justise jayant nath ne likhaa he ki dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he ki dilli ke uparajyapal mantriparishad kii sahaayta or salaah maanane ke liye baadhya hai, un maamalon main jinamein vidhansabha ko 239 e ke upbandh (3)(a) ke tahat kanoon banane kaa adhikaar hasil he
 It has no merit and cannot be accepted

 Otherwise how can it be that the constitution bench of the Supreme Court also believes that Delhi is the Union Territory, the High Court also believes that Delhi is the Union Territory
 magar hoicourt kahata he ki alji bos hai, supreme court kahata he ki mukhyamantri bos hai
 The comments in sari hedline ko aap dekhie yaad kiijie un dinon ko jab tivi kii bahes main yah dikhaaya gaya or akhabaaron main yah chapa ki dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar kaa mukhiya koi haisiyat hi nahin rakhata he
 It has been written in the High Court's decision that in the case of services, the Lieutenant Governor can act like the Central Government
 supreme court ke faisle main kaha jaataa he ki jin teen chaar maamalon main dilli vidhansabha kaa adhikaar nahin banataa he, uske alaava leftinent governor kaa koi dakhal nahin banataa he
 They are administrators, not governors
 dilli ko rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa he, ye faisla pehle kii samvidhan peeth ne bhi diya he or is samvidhan peeth ne bhi diya, magar aaj ke faisle ke baad se uparajyapal kii seemaa saaf ho gai he
 The Chief Minister has got the right to be the Chief Minister
 jab-jab arvind kejariwal ne is dakhlandaazi kaa virodh hua, ve is propeganda ke shikaar hue ki dilli kaa kaam nahin kar rahe hai
 Making excuses
 ab saaf ho gaya ki kaam jise karnaa tha use nahin karne diya ja rahaa tha or jise nahin karnaa wo karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha yaa kaam hi nahin hone de rahaa tha
 After this decision, it should be clear in the mind of the Lieutenant Governor that he is the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi but Delhi is not his
 janata ne unhen nahin chunaa he, balki unka chunaav kaise hua he, ye behatar vahi jaanate hai
 Through two Lieutenant Governors, the elected government of Delhi has played the game of forming a government that works under the Governor
 ummid he khilaadi ab kuch doosraa khel khelenge, ye vaala band kar denge
 It is clear from the decision of the Supreme Court that the people of Delhi did not choose the mlas while voting at India Gate that the political party will vote and the Lt
 Governor will rule
 supreme court ne aaj kaha ki bhoomi, police or kanoon vyavastha par kend sarkaar kaa adhikaar he
 Barring these matters, the Lieutenant Governor is obliged to accept the opinion of the Delhi Government
 uski madad lene ke liye baadhya hai
 The Delhi government should be allowed to enact and administer laws in other matters
 samvidhan kii kitaab palatie, supreme court ne vahi kaha jo samvidhan main shabdash kaha gaya he
 239A clearly states that the Lieutenant Governor shall have a Council of Ministers to assist and advise in the exercise of its functions in respect of those matters in respect of which the Legislative Assembly has the power to legislate, which shall be 10 percent of the total strength of the Assembly
 Consists of not more members
 jiskaa pradhan mukhyamantri hoga
 The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly
 pataa nahin leftinent governor ne samvidhan kii koun si kitaab pard lee thi, jisamen likhaa tha ki pradhan mukhyamantri uparajyapal hoga
 Today the Supreme Court has held the Constitution Bench holding the correct book and correct interpretation of the Constitution
 filon ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 Recently, the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister had staged a sit-in in the LG office, the Lt
 Governor did not even come
 is faisle main likhaa he ki kisi mudde par matbhed hone par uparajyapal apane paas file nahin rakh sakate the, unhen raashtrapati ke paas bhejnaa hoga or ye matbhed chote mote mudde par nahin hone chahie
 One place in the judgment clearly states that the Executive Governor has enough power over the executive decision taken by the Council of Ministers to send it to the President for consideration in case of disagreement, but the Constitutional Plan does not say that the Council of Ministers should make its decisions
 For this the consent of the Lt
 Governor has to be obtained
 vighansabha chune hue pratinidhiyon ke mat kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, unke mat or faisle kaa har haal main sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 All decisions and proposals should be communicated to the Lieutenant Governor, so that the dialogue remains, but this communication does not mean that the Lieutenant Governor has to be approved
 ek hi samvidhan he
 The things written in it are also permanently printed
 iske baad bhi do saal pehle agast 2016 main dilli hoicourt kii vyakhya or 2018 main supreme court kii vyakhya main zamin aasmaan kaa antar he
 How can it be so that there can be such a difference in the understanding of the Constitution
 4 agast 2016 ke apane faisle main justise jayant nath ne likhaa he ki dilli sarkaar kaa kahana he ki dilli ke uparajyapal mantriparishad kii sahaayta or salaah maanane ke liye baadhya hai, un maamalon main jinamein vidhansabha ko 239 e ke upbandh (3)(a) ke tahat kanoon banane kaa adhikaar hasil he

 The Supreme Court today said that the central government has authority over land, police and law and order
 in maamalon ko chhodkar leftinent governor ko dilli sarkaar kii raay maanane ke liye baadhya hai
 Are obliged to seek his help
 dilli sarkaar ko anya maamalon main kanoon banane or prashasan karne kii ijazat di jaani chahie
 Flip the book of the constitution, the Supreme Court said what is said in the Constitution literally
 239 e main saaf saaf likhaa he ki uparajyapal ko un vishyon ke sambandh main jinaki babat vidhansabha ko vidhi banane kii shakti he, apane krityon kaa prayog karne main sahaayta or salaah dene ke liye ek mantriparishad hogi jo vidhansabha kii kul sadsy sankhya ke 10 pratishat se andhik sadasyon se milakar banegi
 Whose chief will be the chief minister
 mantriparishad vidhansabha ke prati samuhik rup se uttaradaayi hogi
 i do not know which book of the Constitution the lieutenant governor had read in which it was written that the Chief Chief Minister would be the Lieutenant Governor
 aaj supreme court ne samvidhan peeth ne samvidhan kii sahi kitaab or sahi vyakhya pakadaa di he
 There was a lot of controversy about the files
 haal hi main alji ke daftar main mukhyamantri, upmukhyamantri ne dharna diya tha, uparajyapal milane tak nahin aae
 It has been written in the judgment that in case of differences on any issue, the Lieutenant Governor could not keep the file with him, he would have to send it to the President and these differences should not be on minor issues
 faisle main ek jagah saaf-saaf likhaa he ki mantriparishad dwaara liye gaye kaaryakari faisle par up rajyapal ko paryaapt shakti he ki asahmati kii sthiti main raashtrapati ke paas vichaar ke liye bhej den, lekin sanvaidhanik yojana yah kabhi nahin kahati he ki mantriparishad ko apane faisle ke liye uparajyapal kii sahmati leni hogi
 The Vidhan Sabha represents the vote of the elected representatives, their vote and judgment should be respected at all times
 up rajyapal ko sabhi faisle or prastaavon kii soochna di jaani chahie, taaki samvaad bana rahe, lekin is samvaad kaa yah matlab nahin he ki uparajyapal kii manzuri leni he
 There is only one constitution
 usamen likhi hui baaten bhi sthaayee rup se chhapi hai
 Even after this, there is a difference of ground between the interpretation of the Delhi High Court in August 2016 and the interpretation of the Supreme Court in 2018 two years ago
 aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki samvidhan kii samaj main itnaa antar aa saktaa he
 In his judgment dated 4 August 2016, Justice Jayant Nath has written that the Delhi Government maintains that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is obliged to accept the assistance and advice of the Council of Ministers, in those cases in which the Legislative Assembly provides (3) (a) of 239A Has the right to make laws under isamen koi dam nahin he or sweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 i also want to show you the headlines of the newspapers of that time so that you, the audience, basically understand that the interpretation of the constitution also depends on the judges' own understanding
 varanaa yah kaise ho saktaa he ki supreme court kii samvidhan peeth bhi maanati he ki dilli union terrytory he, hoicourt bhi maanata he ki dilli union territary he
 But the High Court says that LG is the boss, the Supreme Court says that the Chief Minister is the boss
 tippaniyan Look at all these headlines, remember those days when it was shown in the TV debate and it was published in the newspapers that the head of the elected government of Delhi does not have any status
 hoicourt ke faisle main likhaa he ki services ke maamle main leftinent governor kend sarkaar kii tarah act kar sakate hai
 It is said in the Supreme Court's decision that apart from the three four cases in which Delhi Legislative Assembly does not have the authority, there is no interference from the Lieutenant Governor
 ve prashaasak hai, rajyapal nahi hai
 Delhi cannot be given the status of state, this decision has been given by the earlier constitution bench and also by this constitution bench, but after today's decision, the boundary of the Lieutenant Governor has been cleared
 mukhyamantri ko mukhyamantri hone kaa adhikaar mila he
 Whenever Arvind Kejriwal protested against this interference, he succumbed to the propaganda that he was not working for Delhi
 bahaane bana rahe hai
 Now it became clear that the work that was to be done was not being allowed to be done, and what it was not to do, it was trying to do or the work was not allowed to happen

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) a new twist has come in the case of the death of journalist Jajendra Singh of Shahjahanpur in UP
 jagendra singh ke bete rahul singh ne khulaasa kiya he ki unke pita ne khud aag lagaakar aatmahatya kii thi
 The family has also withdrawn the CBI probe petition
 is cese main upi ke mantri ramamurti singh verma par aarope lage the
 According to new information, on 1 June 2015, Jagendra Singh had set himself on fire by spraying petrol to avoid police arrest
 iske baad unhone mantri or kotwaal samet kai logon par jalaakar maarane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Jagendra's family initially staged a sit-in and demanded fifty lakh compensation and a job, on which the state government paid a compensation of 30 lakh to the family
 jagendra ke donon beton ko naukari dene kaa aashwaasan bhi diya tha
 After getting the compensation, the family of Jagendra Singh has now revealed that Jagendra himself committed suicide by spraying petrol
 jagendra ke bete kaa yah bhi kahana he ki unhone marane se pehle parivaar ko khud par petrol chhidakane vaali baat bataa di thi
 Now the question arises that if the family knew about suicide, then why was this thing hidden? However, the family of Jagendra Singh has also withdrawn his plea seeking a CBI probe
 bharat ke purvottar main basaa ek rajya assam
 To the west of its capital Guwahati is a famous temple built on the Nilanjan hills — the Kamakhya Temple
 kamakhya devi ke is mandir ke garbhagrih main jo aradhy murti sthapit he, vah kisi balashaali dev kii nahin, balki stri kii yoni kii he
 Every year a four-day fair is held in this temple during the rainy season - Ambubachi Fair
 kehete hai ki is dauraan devi kamakhya rajaswala hoti hai
 This four-day fair is held to celebrate their menstruation
 yah sunakar to lagata he ki is desh main stri hona kitne gaurav kii baat he
 But wait
 baat abhi puri nahin hui he
 There is one more truth to this world-famous temple celebrating the blood that comes out of a woman's body every month for four days — women are not allowed to enter during periods
 ji haa, jis mandir main yoni kii murti he, jahaan devi ke rajaswala hone par mela lagata he, vahaan rajaswala stri kaa pravesh pratibandhit he
 But this tradition has been going on for centuries? Some special reason for repeating this story suddenly like this? The reason is because suddenly the issue of the entry of women from such traditions to religious places has come into the mainstream of debates and controversies and this happened when a large number of people in a remote village in Maharashtra suddenly came up against such a ban on 26 January Women came out on the streets
 maharashtra ke ahmednagar jile main ek chota-sa gaanv he shani shinganapur, jo in dinon khabaron main chaaya hua he
 History books are full of unique information about this village
 kehete hai ki is gaanv main beete 400 saal main kabhi chori, dange, hatya yaa balaatkaar kii ek bhi ghatana nahin hui
 You will not find a lock on the door of any house here
 daravaaje or khidkiyaan khuli rahati hai
 No old man falls ill
 sab swasth hai, khush hai
 No phantom roams here at night
 saare log apane haal se khush hai
 There are just a few old peepal trees, which people touch with reverence every Saturday during fasting
 aisa kaise? kyonki is rahasyamay gaanv kii raksha main ek chamatkaarik kaala pathar tainaat he
 He is Shani Dev
 is gaanv par anisht kii chaaya bhi nahin he kyonki is par swayan bhagwaan shani kii krupa he, jo ki muktakash mandir main saadhe paanch foot ke ek vishalkay pathar ke rup main virajman hai
 People say, to stay away from their dilated eyes or else it would look like seven and a half
 anisht kii chaaya tak se dur is gaanv main 26 janvari ko jo hua, vah shani shinganapur ke pujaariyon, dharmaguruon or dharm ke kai swayambhu thekedaaron ke liye kisi anisht se kam nahin tha
 On Republic Day, the eyes of the entire nation suddenly fell on television, when they saw about one and a half thousand women walking towards the Shani temple
 is bheed main saamaajik kaaryakarta, gruhiniyan or chatraayen shaamil thim
 The demand of these women was very modest - "they should also be allowed to enter and worship inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple
" ''paramparaagat rup se is mandir kaa garbhagrih mahilaon ke liye nishidgh he
 It is believed that on approaching women, God begins to release 'harmful waves'
 saikadon varshon se is mandir main mahilaon kaa pravesh varjit rahaa he
 Women too always followed this unwritten rule without being discouraged and never questioned it
 or us din aisa kuch hua ki achaanak yah mudda tivi channelon kii bahason or akhabaaron ke lekhon main sabase bada sawaal ban gaya
 Vrinda Grover, a well-known lawyer, asks, "our constitution gives women equal rights in every case
" phir mandiron main yah bhedbhaav kyon?'' samaaj kaa ek bada tabaka un mahilaon ke saath khadaa tha
 He unitedly said, "it is a dark day for democracy
" '' lekin usase bhi bada samooh abhi bhi parampara or samskruti ke hi geet ga rahaa tha
 This whole incident took an aggressive form in Shingnapur
 mandir kii suraksha main police tainaat kar di gai
 There was also a clash between the women and the police
 vivaad yahaan tak pahunch gaya ki maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadavis ko bhi ise shant karne ke liye hastkshep karnaa padaa
 Sharad Pawar and Baba Ramdev also stood in favor of women, but the temple started to find a new cut of this demand of women
 or ikkisvin sadi main vigyaan or aadhukita kii ore kadam badhaate is mulk ke saamne ek baar phir yah sawaal khadaa ho gayakri ''stri-purush baraabar hai, unke maanviya adhikaar baraabar hai, is desh kaa kanoon or samvidhan donon ke liye baraabar he,'' kya yah desh abhi bhi is sahaj, buniyadi baat ko sweekaar karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he? kya ek loktantr ke rup main ham ab bhi sanvaidhanik sankat se nahin jujh rahe hai? samvidhan barabari kii guarantee detaa he or dharm use maanane se inkaar kar detaa he? is antarvirodh kii jaden kahaan hai or iskaa hal kahaan he?dharm banaam samvidhandharm or samvidhan kii jodi bahut bemail he
 The two do not co-exist
 donon virdohi baaten karte hai
 But both exist in the fact that there are ideological riots and decisions for both the body and sexuality of the woman
 stri deh ke sawaal par aksar donon kii bhidnt hoti rahati he
 Religious organizations want to monitor everything of women
 ve bad-chadhakar bataate hai ki auraton ko kya pahananaa chahie or kya nahin pahananaa chahie, kisase baat kerani chahie yaa khaali vakt kaise or kiske saath bitaana chahie
 The legal system, on the other hand, enters the house to determine the terms of family, relations and companionship
 bhagwaan kii puja karne sambandhi mahilaon ke adhikaar par hua yah sangharsh or isse upja vivaad is bhraamak vichaar ke ird-gird khadaa hua he ki kya shuddh he or kya nahin
 Sociologist of Religion Professor A

 Shah says, "history of religion shows that it is still very powerful in social and personal life
 lekin aadhunik jivan kii kuch anivaary jaruratein or paristhitiyon ne hamen badalane ke liye majaboor kiya he
 "for example, the centuries-old taboo of cooking or eating without bathing has now disappeared completely
" chappal pahane hue khaane kii varjana bhi apraasangik ho chuki he
 After the haircut, not everyone takes a shower
 ek samay tha, jab rajaswala auraten na khaanaa pakaati thim or na hi parosati thim
 But today it is not so
 ve aasaani se rasoi main ja rahi hai or sab kaam kar rahi hai
 These taboos are definitely broken in the society, but they are still firmly established in religion
 mandiron main stri ke shudgh or ashudgh hone kaa niyam atal or prabal he
 Pro
 shah kehete hai, ''aakhirkaar yahi vah jagah he, jahaan manushya kii jaruratein, ummiden, bhay or aakankshaayen viraam paati hai
 However, he says that Hinduism too has been constantly changing over time
 lekin jeenyu main itihaas kii professor nivedita menon puuchhati hai, ''lekin kya striyon ke maamle main bhi dharm utani hi udaartaa ke saath badla he? jawaab he- nahin
 "she says," Why only in the temples, is the menstruating woman not considered as profane even inside the house
 kya ghar ke bheetar bhi is dauraan use puja karne yaa dharmik pustak ko chune kaa adhikaar he?'' dharm har jagah striyon ke saath bhedbhaavpurn vyavhaar karata he or unhen doum darje kaa samajhataa he
 Why only temple? Are the dargahs untouched by this? Writer and columnist Annie Zaidi says that she quit visiting Nizamuddin's dargah in Delhi because women are not allowed inside to offer sheets? i find this thing outrageous
 ve chaahate hai ki ham vahaan jaaen bhi, chadar bhi chadhayen or daan bhi den, unhen auraton kaa paisa to chahie, lekin izzat dene ko ve taiyaar nahin hai
 "what does the law say? The Shinganapur incident was heard only on January 11, when the Supreme Court, in a ten-year-old trial involving women entering the Sabarimala temple in Kerala, said," Sabarimala temple women Cannot restrict '' mahila vakeelon ke ek samooh indian yang loyrs association (iviele) ne kerala ke mandir ke khilaaf yah mukadmaa daayar kiya tha
 Although the court has not yet given a ruling on this, the judges clearly countered this controversial tradition when they said that "temple cannot prohibit the entry of women only on the basis of religion, unless That you do not have any constitutional rights for it
 ''dharmasthalon main mahilaon ke pravesh se judi is jang ke centre main darasal supreme court or samvidhan he
 The Supreme Court, despite not being very outspoken, has made a clear comment that there is no such discrimination in the Constitution
 haalanki sabarimala par abhi bhi faisle kaa intjaar he
 The battle of Dawingshanapur reached the dargahs is not limited to the entry of women in Hindu shrines only

 This ban is against both democracy and Islam
 dharmasthal par sirf purushon kaa haq nahin he
 According to IWLA President Naushad Ahmad Khan, both the cases stand on three fundamental rights provided in the Constitution: Article 14 (equality before law), Article 25 (right to freedom of religion) and Article 26 (religious centers should be allowed to Freedom to manage religious affairs)
 khan kehete hai, ''in treston main akut dhan jamaa he or iskaa aksar durupyog hota he
 The government must intervene to bring it into the economy
 ''saamaajik badlaav kaise aayega?kanoon to apana kaam kar rahaa he
 In both these cases, the decision of the court will decide the direction
 lekin ek sawaal or bhi he, jo samaaj vigyaani ashish nandi poochhate hai, ''kya loktantric adhikaron ko sirf kanoon or nyaayatantr ke jariye hasil kiya ja saktaa he yaa iske liye kisi saamaajik-saanskrithik badlaav kii bhi jarurat he?'' aise hi ek saamaajik-saanskrithik badlaav kii shuruyaat tab hui, jab kuch yuva ladakiyon ne sabarimala mandir ke faisle ke virodh main soshal media par hapi tu blide campan chalaaya
 In November this year, Travancore Devaswom Board President, Prayar Gopalakrishnan said that a machine would be installed in the Sabarimala temple to check the purity of women
 yah sunishchit karne ke baad hi unhen mandir main pravesh diya ja saktaa he ki kahin ve maahvaaree se to nahin guzar raheen
 a 'happy to bleed' campaign started on social media against this statement
 ladakiyon ne apni photo lagaai or likhaa—hamen is baat kii koi sharmindagi nahin he ki maheene main chaar din hamaare sharir se raktasrav hota he
 Is it a shame Writer and activist Meena Kandaswamy asks, "the body of women is different from men in this case, not that they have periods?" So is it a sin? Is there any crime? Is dirt? Then the rules of where to go, what to touch, what to do, why? We can go wherever we want, we can do whatever we want
 ''dharm yaa purush satta?darasal, yah mudda sirf dharm or kanoon kaa nahin he
 Sociologist and psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakkar asks, "isn't religion the only institution to strengthen patriarchy?" What is the share of women in religious institutions? Does not religion help the idea that man is superior to woman
 ham nari kii puja kii baat kar sakate hai, lekin uske baraabar manushya hone ko nahin sweekaar sakate
 "writer Taslim Nasreen says," Whatever be the religion, he has always been anti-women

 "similar questions are also raised by Indologist Narsingh Prasad Bhaduri of the Asiatic Society of Kolkata
 kya ham sachmuch apni paramparaon ko jaanate hai? aaj ham jo kar rahe hai, kya vah sachmuch pracheen or sanathan hi he? ve kehete hai, ''brahmand viraasaton ke bich shani kaa koi ullekh veda, upanishad or puraanon main kahin nahin miltaa

" ''mahila adhikaar kaaryakarta or dilli ke centre for soshal research kii ranjana kumari kahati hai, ''dharm ek cheez he or dharmik santhaan duusari
 According to him, the management trusts of these institutions are not only violating the constitution by giving women the right to worship equal to men, but also institutionalizing the inferiority of women

 "it has broad social implications," she says
 '' desh main hone vaale satsangon main jane vaali nabbe fisadi mahilaayein hoti hai

 ''striyon ke liye pravesh varjit hesbarimala yaa shani mandir akele apwaad nahin hai
 The same is the case with the Karthikeya temple in Pushkar, Rajasthan, where women get curses instead of blessings
 kerala ke shri padmanabhaswami mandir ke kaksh main mahilaon ko pravesh nahin miltaa
 In Rajasthan's Ranakpur Jain temple, a clear message is written for the menstruating women — entry during menstruation is prohibited
 chhattisgarh ke mawali mata ke mandir main bhi mahilaon ke liye 'no intry' kaa board laga hua he
 When a woman enters Mangal Chandi in Jharkhand, she is devastated
 assam kii kamakhya devi to khud rajaswala hoti hai, phir bhi rajaswala mahilaayein vahaan nahin ja saktin
 It is written in thick white letters on a blue board outside the temple of Avadhoota Devi in kovalam, Kerala — entering at the time of menstruation is against the culture of the temple
 '' puri sthit bhagwaan jagannatha ke mandir parisar main sthit bimala mata ke mandir main durga puja ke dauraan 16 dinon tak mahilaon kaa pravesh varjit hota he
 But is it necessary to hang a big board or a machine to check the period is necessary to ban it? The answer to this question is hidden in the reply of Pandit Ambika Acharya, the priest of the famous Samaleshwari temple in Sambalpur, Odisha
 ve kehete hai, ''mandiron kii pavitrataa banaae rakhane ke prati mahilaayein khud kaaphi gambhir hoti hai
 Since entering temples and worshiping during menstruation is not appropriate, they do not do so by themselves
 iske liye hamen prachaar karne kii jarurat nahin he
 "there is no such board in any temple in our village," says Pallavi, who is doing phd in German language at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi

 The politics of worship: Trupti Desai, 38, who led the Shani temple movement in Shinganapur, is not willing to believe that Shani Dev is not interested in her worship

 He was bathed with milk to purify the departed deity
