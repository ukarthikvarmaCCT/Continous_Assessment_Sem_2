 For a list of World Heritage Sites, see: africa · america · arab rajya · asia evam australesia · europekhatare main sthal Windows Vista is the latest in a series of Microsoft operating systems and possibly the most revolutionary after Windows 95
 haalaanki vista oparating system ko adhik lokapriyata uske triayami graphics swaroop or vibhinn desktop onimeshan kii vajah se mili he lekin vastav main yah microsoft kii ore se jari kiya gaya ab tak kaa sabase surakshit oparating system bhi mana ja rahaa he
 It is also more efficient in terms of communication and networking than its previous operating system
 vista ke liye hindi samarthan bhi puri tarah uplabdh he or hindi language interphes pack ke madhyam se windos vista ko puri tarah hindi ke rang main ranga ja saktaa he
 Computer users have a curiosity about whether they really need to adopt Windows Vista, the new operating system released by Microsoft
 kya microsoft ke pichley oparating system windos ekspe windos 2003 or windos 2000 kii tulana main isamen aise fitures hai jinaki andekhi karnaa sambhav na ho
 Microsoft claims that Vista is more capable, simpler, faster, smooth and secure than previous Windows
 vista pichley oparating systams kii tulana main adhik teji se khulata or band hota he
 Start up and shutdown processes are completed in five to ten seconds
 haalaanki isamen vista ke apekshaakrit behatar hardware kaa bhi yogadan he lekin khud oparating system ke code main bhi iske liye vishesh prayaas kiya gaya he
 Vista's boom is also due to its new memory management technology that keeps the most used applications ready for loading in advance
 ise 'memri fech' kaha jaataa he
 The Ready Boost feature in Vista has also contributed to its speed
 ab tak windos main memri sambandhi atirikt aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye virtual memri ke rup main pejafilon kaa istemaal hota tha
 These were placed on the computer's hard disk
 lekin vista main iske liye yuasabi drive kaa istemaal karne kaa praavdhaan he jo hard discs kii tulana main bahut tej gati se kaary karti he
 Microsoft has also provided hybrid hard drive support to its new operating system, which increases computer speed by using both flash drives and traditional hard drives combined
 windos vista main sabase pehle dhyaan khinchne vaali cheez he iskaa windos airo naamak khubasurat mukhaawaran or graphic effects
 Although such Sudarshan graphics are already present on Macintosh computers, they are first exposed through 'vista' on the Windows platform
 windos vista home premium, bijness, ultimate or enterprise sanskarnon se yukt un computaron par jinamein ek acha graphics adeptor maujuud ho, airo ke mohak graphics effects kaa anand liya ja saktaa he
 This assertion has changed the core of Windows and has made it much more attractive, diversified and decent than before
 airo ke ucch gunvattta vaale graphics or drishy prabhaavon ne windos computer kaa saundarya to badhaayaa he lekin uski vajah se computer kii kaaryakshmata yaa gati main koi kami nahin aati
 Aero has two major features - Windows Flip and Windows Flip 3D
 inke madhyam se aap apane desktop ko zyada suvidhajanak rup se vyavasthit kar sakate hai
 There has been a general perception among Microsoft users about Microsoft's operating systems that they are less secure than their rival operating systems and are relatively more vulnerable to viruses, hacking, spa ware, etc
 microsoft ne vista main is baat par khaas dhyaan diya he
 Although Vista's original 'kernel' is not rewritten, its security has been strengthened this time
 pehali baat to yah ki ab is oparating system ke sabhi bhaag karnel mod main nahin chalate balki unamem se kuch chuninda hisse hi chalate hai
 Most drivers and software in Vista run in user mode and it is no longer easy to install anything in kernel mode
 iske liye sicurity certificate or administrator str ke adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 And it would be very difficult to get administrator level privileges, especially in offices
 windos vista main saamaanya upyogkarta ke adhikaar simit hai
 It is also not that you as a normal user cannot install the software in your computer
 aisa karne ke liye unhen asthaayee taur par jaruri adhikaar praapt ho jate hai
 Microsoft has created two categories of computers for installing Vista operating system - Vista Capable PC and Vista Premium Ready
 aise sabhi computer windos vista sakasham hai jinamein kam se kam 800 megahatrj kaa procesar or 512 embi system memri uplabdh ho
 Such processors are rare now because hardly anyone is buying less than 2 ghz processor in the market
 yadi aapane pichley do ek saalon main apana computer kharida he to uskaa procesar kam se kam itani kshamta kaa avashya hoga
 It may be a matter of system memory that your traditional computer may have 128 MB or 256 MB memory
 aise main aapako saat-aath sau rupye kharch karke apni ram kaa apgredation karwaanaa pad saktaa he
 For Windows Vista capable computers there must be at least a graphics card supporting Direct X9 with WDDM driver support available
 computer ke graphics card main 32 embi kii graphics memri ho to paryaapt he
 Additionally, you will need a DVD ROM drive which may already be present in your computer
 hard discs main mahaj 20 jibi sthaan uplabdh ho, jisamen se 15 jibi khaali sthaan ho, to paryaapt he
 Simply, you don't need anything else to run Windows Vista Home Basic Edition
 mobile 8 The Greek dark period is called in the history of Greece from 1200 BCE to 800 BCE, the articles related to which have not been found by historians
 is yug se pehle ke rekhiy bi lipi main likhi misinian unani ke bahut se namoonay mitti ke takhto or bartanon par or imaaraton par mili hai
 After this "dark" period, the use of this dialect is not found, but only the writings of the northern dialect called Classical Greek, which use a script similar to the modern Greek alphabet
 misinian yug main bartanon or anya vastuon par bahut vistrut chitron ko dekha jaataa tha, lekin andhkaar yug main mili vastuon par sade rekha-chitron ko hi paaya gaya, jis se yah laga ki ek kala-viksit samskruti kisi vajah se girakar aviksit ho gai
 To understand these facts, historians linked the events in such a way that first Mycenaean Greek culture was flourishing, then there was an invasion of people called Dorians from the north who brought an end to this civilization
 lagbhag 400 saalon tak yunaan ek barbarta ke andhkaar main rahaa or is kaal kii koi likhaai nahin milti kyonki likhaaiyaan bani hi nahin thim
 After that, civilization was born again with a new language
 iske vipareet vartmaan ke kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki aisa koi andhkaar kaal kabhi tha hi nahin or is kaal ke lekh isliye nahin milen kyonki unhen thik se khoja nahin gaya he
 The differences continue
 "unani andhkaar kaal" ko angrezi main "greek dark ajiz" kehete hai
 In Greek this period is called "geometrical epochal", which means "geometric age", because art is seen as sketches on objects found in this period
 1200 isapurv ke aasapaas misinion ke mahal or unke dur-daraaj nagaron ke nasht hone yaa kisi kaaran se chode die jane ke nishaan milte hai
 This civilization was very organized and it was not well known why their system began to disintegrate
 yah ek kaansya yug kii samskruti thi or isi kaal main kuch logon ne lohe kaa prayog sikh liya tha
 Iron is stronger than bronze, and in many places, the fighters of bronze weapons were defeated by those who used iron
 sambhav he ki aise kisi louh-prayogi jaati ne misinion kii sabhyataa ko khatm kar diya ho
 In the same period, in many areas of the Mediterranean Sea, the sudden change in weather also destroyed the crops which caused starvation
 aise kuch pramaan mili hai ki in kshetron main shaskaon ke viruddh bahut se vidroh bhadak rahe the
 It is possible that for some reason or a mixture of these, the Mycenaeans may have been attacked by the Dorians from the north or by people of another race from the sea
 purv main anatolia main hathi sabhyataa bhi dagamagaa rahi thi
 Egyptian sources also mention some of the sudden movements and attacks of such maritime people during this period in some ancient Egyptian writings on the south: inamen se bahut si jatiyaan phonishia ke paas ke kshetron se thi
 It is also seen that when the articles resumed after the end of the use of the Linear b script of the Mycenaeans, they were in the Greek script which was based on the Phoenician alphabet

 The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom and the American Kennel Club in the United States recognize only two varieties of Chihuahua: those with long coats and those with soft coats, also referred to as those with short hair
 ve anuvanshik rup se ek hi nasl ke hai
 The term soft-coat does not mean that hair will necessarily be soft, as hair can range from a velvet touch to a mustache
 lambey baalo vaale chihuahua vastav main sparsh main chikne hote hai, jinke bal mulaayam or maheen hote hai, jo unhen unka phula swaroop pradaan karte hai
 Unlike many long-haired breeds, the long-haired Chihuahua requires no pruning and minimal grooming

 Opponents of the recognition of dead dogs in breed standards suspect that the color came from other dogs by modern genetic hybridization and not by natural genetic changes
 chihuahua ke rang kaa vargeekaran vibhinn sambhaavnaaon kii maujuudagi ke kaaran jatil ho saktaa he
 Examples might be blue brindle or a chocolate and tan

 ve anya naslon ke saath hameshaa maitreepurn nahin hote, or unamem ek "jatigat" prakruti pai jaati he, jisase ve anya kutton kii bajaay anya chihuahua ke saath rahanaa aksar pasand karte hai
 These symptoms usually make them unsuitable for homes where children are not calm and patient
 chihuahua dhyaan, sneh, vyaayaam or dulaar ke bhukhe hote hai
 They may be aggressive, but eager to be happy
 unki pratishtha ek "yappy" kute ke rup main he, jise uchit prashikshan ke saath hal kiya ja saktaa he
 Chihuahua with proper breeding are not "yappies"; The AKC standard calls for "terrier-like behavior"
 is nasl ko visheshgy pashu chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jaise ki prasav or danta chikitsa dekhbhaal main

 Chihuahua have molera, or a soft spot in their skull, and are the only breed of dogs that are born with an incomplete skull
 yah molera umr ke saath bharta he, lekin pehle chah maheenon ke dauraan kaaphi dekhbhaal karne kii zarurat hoti he jab tak ki khopadi kaa puri tarah se gathan naa ho jaae
 kuch molera puri tarah se band nahin hote hai or kisi chot se bachaav ke liye unhen atirikt dekhbhaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Many veterinarians are not familiar with the Chihuahua as a breed and mistakenly consider a molera to be hydrocephalus
 america ke chihuahua club ne is ghaatak galat nidaan se sambandhit ek bayaan jari kiya he
 Chihuahua are also at risk of hypersensitivity or low blood sugar, they are the only dogs with diabetes
 rakt sharkara yah vishesh rup se pillon ke liye khatarnaak he
 If left untreated, hypoglycemia can result in coma or death
 lagaataar khilaate hue is rog se ladaa ja saktaa he

 There is a risk of dekhbhaal kerani chahie ki koi aagatuk yaa bachche uski ankhon main kuch konch na den
 Water comes in the eyes to remove dust or allergens that fall in the eyes
 dainik safai se ankhen saafe rahengi or ankhon main dhundhala nahin hoga
 Chihuahua has a tendency to tremble but is not a health issue, rather it occurs when the dog is under stress, agitated or feels cold
 isaki ek vajah yah ho sakati he ki chote kutton main bade kutton kii tulana main ek ucch chayapachay hota he or isliye ve garmi ko teji se udaate hai
 For this reason, Chihuahua often wear coats or sweaters when going out in the cold or in more air-conditioned places
 chihuahua, sone ke liye kambal main aksar khudaai karte hai or let jate hai
 Although figures are often found to vary, as with any other breed, the average life span of a healthy Chihuahua ranges from about 10 years to 17 years
 chihuahua kabhi-kabhi chunavi bhakshan karte hai or unhen paryaapt poshan pradaan karne kaa khyaal rakhaa janaa chahie
 Chihuahua got this reputation because they discover small pieces of food throughout the day
 in lagaataar bhakshan karne waalon ko kabhi-kabhi geela yaa taaja bhojan sabase aakarshak gandh pradaan karata he
 "they eat when they are hungry" does not apply because the Chihuahuas are susceptible to hyperactivity and may worsen if there is a long interval in getting food
 saath hi saath, yah bhi dhyaan dena chahie ki unhen aavashyaktaa se adhik naa khilaayaa jaye
 unhen maanav bhojan nahin dena chahie
 Due to their small size, even slightly high-fat or sweet food can increase the weight of the Chihuahua
 adhik vajan vaale chihuahua ko jodon kii chotein, shwasapranali avrodh, chronic bronchitis or laghu jivan avadhi kaa khatra rahata he
 Chihuahua is also known to have a genetic condition called 'luxating patella'
 yah ek anuvanshik haalat he jo sabhi kutton main, buudhe yaa jawan, patale yaa adhik vajan vaale kutton main ho saktaa he, vishesh rup se chote kutton main
 kuch kutton main, patelor khaanche kaa nirmaan karne vaali lakeeren sahi aakaar kii nahin hoti hai or ek uthali naalee ban jaati he
 In a dog with a shallow groove, the patella crushes to the side, especially the inside
 This causes the feet to bond and the Chihuahua lifts their feet above the ground
 jab patela jaandh kii haddi ke naalee se ukhd jaataa he, yah aamtaur par tab tak apni saamaanya sthiti main nahin lautataa jab tak quadricepse mansapeshiyon main aaraam nahin hota or uski lambaai nahin bad jaati
 yahi kaaran he ki kyon prabhavit kutta apane pairon ko praarambhik visthaapan ke baad kuch minute ke liye upar uthaane ke liye majaboor ho jaataa he
 When the muscle contractions and the patella dislocates from its correct position, the joint remains dislocated or bent
 jaandh kii haddi ke shalya nalika ke chalate, jaandh kii haddi ke paar phisalane vaali ghutane kii topi kuch dard paidaa kar sakati he
 Once out of the situation, the animal does not feel any discomfort and continues its activity

 mark cantanbarni goldmangiyani nunari Zach Snyderkart Johnstead jerard butleralena headidavid venhemdaminic westvincent regan '300 is the 2006 English-language American mythological war saga film based on the comics series of the same name published in 1998 by Frank Miller and Lynn Warley
 donon kii kahaniyon main thermopialey ke ran main hue farsiyon ke saath hui yuddh ko punervarnit kiya gaya he
 The film is directed by Zack Snyder, with Miller taking over the reins of the consultant with the executive producer
 filmakan kaa kaam behad super-impojishan chroma kii takanic ke saath kiya gaya he, joki mul kamiks pustak main chitron ke sahare hubahu doharaaya gaya he
 The gist of the story revolves around King Leonidas, who with his 300 Sparta fights a great battle against King Zerkys of the Persians, who considers himself a god-like surveyor, and his 300,000 invading soldiers
 is yuddh ke utsaah ko kaayam rakhane ke liye, rani gorgo sparta ke logon se apni pati ke liye protsaahan paane kii koshish karti he
 In the film, the voice of Sparta soldier Dilios is taken as a narrative
 film kii kathavachak kii takneekee style main, vibhinn haroonges praaniyon ke saath, un 300 logon kii saath yah ek aitihaasik mithkeey gaatha ban gai he
 The film "300" was released as a DVD, Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD in March 09, 2007 and July 31, 2007 as domestic video in the United Nations IMAX theaters, both ways
 film kii mishrit pratikriya milane baad bhi, iske mul vijuval drishyon evam style kii kaaphi saraahna kii gai, lekin vijuval effactos ke adhik upyog se charitrankan kamjor hone tathaa iran ke pracheen farsiyon ko, unke charitra ko kaaphi had tak jatvaad se prerit bataane par kaaphi aalochana hui; haalaanki film ne baks offis par apni behtareen upasthiti dikhaakar, kareeb $450 karod se adhik kaa vyavsaay kar, sadi kii sabase badi baks offis itihaas ke 24wein paaydaan par jeet darj karaayi
 The film's next sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire, based on Miller's unpublished graphic novel Zerkys Purvagam, was released on March 7, 2014
 san 479 isa purv, thermopyley ke yuddh ke ek saal baad, dilios, naamak pracheen sparta paidal sainik, leonidas pratham ke bachapan se lekar sparta rivaajon ke jariye unako raja banaae jane tak kii kahani sunaata he
 The story of Dilios continues, according to which a Persian envoy pleads with King Zerkias's order of "land and water" at the threshold of Sparta, otherwise threatening him to become a wrath of the wrath; Sparta kicks the messenger and his soldiers into the blind well in this battle
 leonidas tab afars naamak pande-pujaariyon se milane jaataa he, taaki vah yah ranneeti samajha saken ki vah un farsiyon kii vishaal sena ko bhi desh seemaadwar se peeche hataa sakate hai; yojana ke mutabik vah aisi tang galiyare kii diwaar kaa nirmaan karenge jisase farsiyon kii fouj chattaanon or samudr ke raste funs jaaen
 The enforcers then listen to the oracles' prophecy for consultation, who make their decree that it would not be right for the Spartans to go to war during Carnia
 hataasha or gusse se bharaa leonidas ke lautate hi, unke peeche xerqies kaa doot aa jaataa he, jo afars ko unke prachhnn sahyog ke liye bataur inaam detaa he
 Although mobilizing his Spartan soldiers without the permission of the Enforcers, Leonidas makes up his bodyguard by making excuses from the three hundred best soldiers he has chosen; Moves to the Arcade
 thermopyley pahunchakar, ve chattaanon kii diwaar khadi kar dete hai or maare gaye tohi farsiyon kii laashen unheen ke bich chunavaa dete hai, is harakat se farsi doot buree tarah krodhit ho uthta he
 Among them, Stelios, an elite Sparta soldier named, tells the Persians to return from the border and warns of punishment for cutting off the arm in the name of Zerkys
 isi dauraan, leonidas kii mulaakaat efialtis, naam ke kurup spartavasi se hoti he jise shaayad uske abhibhavakon ne sparta ke kanoon anusaar shishu hatya se bachaane ke liye vahaan se bhaag nikle the
 For the same emancipation of his father, Apialtis pretends to be reinstated from Leonidas into the army, but Leonidas warns him that he can be a sacrificial victim to the Pharisees at times, leading to the fall of the entire Sparta army
 usapar taras khaakar, leonidas uske shaareerik aakshamata ko dekhte hue inkaar kar detaa he kyonki vah apni dhaal jarurat hisaab se unchaa uthaa nahin paata; jiske liye sainya vyuh rachana main jaruri sambhaavna honi chahie, efialtis yah sun behad khafa ho jaataa he
 Soon the battle begins when the Spartans refuse to surrender weapons
 ekmaatr pravesh maarg ke tang raaston kaa unhen bakhubi laabh miltaa he, or apni behtareen yuddh kaushal ke balboote, sparton apane veg se samooche farsiyon kii phujon kii lahar ko bhi peeche dhakel detii
 At the end of the war, Zerkias himself meets Leonidas and asks him to surrender, believing his loyalty to the country in exchange for an offer of wealth and power; Leonidas turns down the offer and ridicules Zerkys as a mockery by calling his warriors to be inferior
 is pratyuttar main, xerqies apni agrim rakshakon ko ladane bhej detaa he, joki raat ke baad amar ho jate hai
 However, even after a few Sparta's are killed, they mightily defeat those immortal defenders
 phir duusare din, xerqies ek nai phujon kii khep asia or anya farsi nagareey mulk se bulaai jaati he, jisamen jangi hathi ko bhi shaamil kiya jaataa he, taaki sabhi spartaon ko ek waar main kuchlaa ja saken, par sabhi tareeke naakaam rahete hai
 Meanwhile, Affialtis reveals the secret of intelligence to Zerkys on the condition that he also be given wealth, luxury and a uniform
 arkedians ko jald hi efialtis kii is dagabaaji kaa pataa chalata he, lekin sparton vahiin rah jate hai
 Leonidas then orders the wounded but reluctant Dilios to go back to Sparta and make every incident known to everyone as a "victory Saga"
 sparta main, rani gorgo un 300 sipaahiyon kii sahaayta ke liye sparton samiti se atirikt bal bhejne kii guhaar lagaati he
 But the corrupt politician Theran, according to which this committee will speak in his own "right" and even blames Rani Sahiba, that he will not shy away from a physical relationship to make his demands
 maujuuda sabha main theran ko apane khilaaf bejjati hote dekh, gorgo rosh main aapa khokar uski hatya kar daalati he, jiske saath hi uske labaade main chipa xerqies kii sone ke muhrevaali asharfiyon bharaa thilaa gir jaataa he
 On the disclosure of this dishonesty, the unanimous consent of all mps allows for additional forces to be sent
 tisare din, farsi fouj, efialtis kaa anusaran karte hue, uske bataae khufia raaston se guzarakar, spartaon ko gher leti he
 Zerkius's commander again demands his surrender
 leonidas lagbhag khud ko ghutane tekte hue darshata he, tabhi stelios uski peeth par kudakar chalaang lagaataa he or senapati ko maar daalata he
 The enraged Zerkias orders his soldiers to attack
 leonidas uth khadaa hota he or xerqies par bhaalaa phenk daalata he; is maamuli chook main bhi, gujarata hua bhaalaa katate huue uskaa cheharaa jakhmi kar daalata he, or sabit ho jaataa he ki unka tathakthith "devataaon ke raja" bhi nashwar he
 Leonidas and his surviving Spartan fighters also fight the last man to finally be killed by a fierce barrage of arrows
 dilios sparta lautataa he, jiske saath hi sabha main sunai vyaakhyaan bhi khatm hoti he
 Inspired by his king's sacrifice, Yunani stands face to face with the Pharisees, with their 40,000 large force and 10,000 Spartao
 baad main un 300 logon ke uplakshya ke unki aakhri bol ke saath, sparta fouj kaa nayaa captain, dilios, farsiyon se ladane plateya ke maidan utarataa he, or film samaapt hoti he

 2006 main bibisi ke vruttchitr herold wilson ke khilaaf sajeesh main aarope lagaaya gaya ki mountbeton ne apane duusare kaarykaal ke dauraan wilson ko bedkhal kar diya tha

 The plot stated that the conspiracy was unsupported by Mountbatten and other members of the British royal family
 wilson lambey samay se maanate the ki unke takhtapalat karne ke liye MI5 dwaara pryojit koi shadyantr rachaa ja rahaa he

 aise logon se unke bahut kam sambhddha the jo 1970 ke dashak main desh ke bare main chintit the or sarkaar ke khilaaf kuch aakraamak karne kii soch rahe the
 He seems to have shared his concerns

 For the purpose of dance etc
, the design of the order and form of operation of different parts of the body is called choreography or choreography
 jo vyakti, nartak yaa kalakaar is kaary ko karata he, use 'nrityrachanaakaar' yaa nritysanyojak' yaa 'koreographer' kehete hai
 The history of dance is as ancient as the history of human life
 maanav jivan kii dainandin kriyakalapon main khushi ke avasaron ne lok nrityon ko janm diya
 These folk dances were always performed in groups
 in nrityon ke pad sanchaalan atyadhik saral hua karte the
 In most of the dances, people danced to form a circular circle, expressing their emotions with limited limb movements
 yah nrity itane sahaj va saral the ki koi dekhne vaala bhi inke saath lay taal main jhuumate hue nrity main shaamil ho jaataa tha
 This is to say that the structure of such dances was very simple
 bhartiya shastreey nrityon kii baat karen to kathak, odisi or bharatnatyam ko chhodkar anya sabhi nrity apane praarambhik swaroop main 'nritynaty' kii shrenee main aate the
 The performance of the group would have been performed by them as a dance drama, however the skill of group structure was not so much emphasized at that time
 purvi deshon kii bhanti pashchim ke deshon main bhi unke nrity kii ek samrudh parampara hamen praapt hoti he
 The art of 'choreography' is widespread in Western countries
 samooh rachana kii kala hamaare nrityon main bhi rahi he or madhyayugin granthon main 'samooh bandh' ke rup main hamen iske bare main jaankaree praapt hoti he
 The 'pindi Bandh' that Acharya Bharata also mentions in his Natyashastra - is related to the structure of the group itself
 bhartiya shastreey nrity main nartan ke tino bhedo nritt, naatay va nrity ke darshan alag-alag rup se bhalee-bhanti kiye ja sakate he
 The dance is composed of theater and dance and the development of this dance can be seen only in Indian dances
 haath va pairon ke lay va talbaddh sanchaalan ke saath jab geet ke shabdon ke anukool bhaavon kaa mail hota he tab vah nrity hota he or yah nrity darshakon ko pashchimi deshon ke nritt kii bhanti keval chamatkrit na hi karata he apitu unki aatma ko bhi sparsh karata he
 That is why ever since Indian dances have imbibed the art of choreography, a new attraction has arisen in them
 bhartiya nrityon main vishaygat vaividhyataa to he hi veshbhusha main bhi vividh rango kii chata he
 Therefore, the skill of group structure increases their influence manifold
 koreography se ek saral si nrity rachana ko bhi aakarshak banaaya ja saktaa he
 When performing a dance composition, the choreographer can combine a group of trained dancers in myriad ways to create unlimited shapes
 kathak nrity kii parampara main ye akritiyaan 'vyuh rachana' ke naam se jaani jaati he
 In solo dance performances these arrayed compositions could be presented through movements
 samooh main in rachanaaon kaa saundarya dwiguneet ho jaataa he
 Some of the figures presented in the group are as follows
 aaj ke electranik yug main darshako kii badalati ruchi ke saath saamanjasy banaae rakhane ke prayaas ne koreography ko or bhi adhik vistaar diya he
 If a group of 6 or 8 dancers display a single dance composition in place of a single dancer, then the variety, variety, and combination of dancers in many different sizes will definitely attract the audience
 bade samooh ko do yaa teen chote samoohon main baantkar kabhi ek sidhi lambii saral rekha to kabhi tirchhi rekha main nartako ko sanyojit kar kabhi ek bada gheraa banaakar uske andar chota gheraa banaakar, kabhi kuch nartako ko sthir tathaa kuch ko gatiman rakhkar, kabhi ek si gati or lay main ek jaise ang sanchaalan rakhkar vibhinn prakaar ke anginat sundar va aakarshak drishy bandho kii yojana kii ja sakati he
 Today the appearance of the stage has also changed completely
 aadhunik takanic se susajjit bade-bade aditorium, vividhta liye hue prakaash yojana, behtareen dhwani vyavastha aadi ne nrity pradarshan kii takanic ko bhi badal diya he
 This change is also inevitable
 vishaal manch par ek akelaa nartak utana prabhaav nahin paidaa kar paata he jitna ki nartakon kaa samooh karegaa
 The rise and fall of several hands at once, the use of illusions, the corresponding costumes and the corresponding light and sound combination is able to take the audience to the state of hypnosis
 koreographer yaa nrity sanyojak chaahe ekal nrity ho yaa samooh, nrity ke itihaas kaa sabase mahatvapurn vyakti he jo nartako ke padaghato va unki angik kriyaaon main saamanjasy dhundta he
 The plot expands the dance technique by combining the costumes of the dancers, the available stage instruments and the dancers in different situations and forms
 ek achche koreographer main nritykala vishay par acchhee pakad hone ke saath-saath usamen saundarya bodh kaa hona atyant aavashyak he
 Dance is visual, so it can be used in costumes, looks, and every instrument of stage effect
 ek kushal koreographer apni rachanaatmak pratibha se in sabhi kaa uchit prayog va pradarshan kar nrity rachana main chamatkaari prabhaav utpann kar saktaa he
 The art of choreography has also expanded in this era of change
 kam samay main adhik kah dena badi sankhya main nartako ko manch uplabdh karwaanaa, manch ke bade aakaar ko bade nartak samooh ke saath samanjit karnaa, tathaa vividhta banaae rakhte hue darshako kaa manoranjan karnaa, nishchit hi ek chunauteepurn kaary he
 Today the changing stage techniques, costumes, sound-lighting scheme, sets etc
 have provided an open sky for choreography to the choreographer, where he can give his imagination the desired flight
