 eucalidia jyamiti main, sambahu tribhuj ke teenon kone bhi samaan hote hai
 Assuming that the length of the side of the equilateral triangle is a, using the Buddhist theorem we get the following values: sambahu tribhuj main lamb, kone samdvibhaajak, bhuj samdvibhaajak or madhyikaayen sabhi sannipatit hote hai
 The triangle ABC whose sides are a, b, c, is a semicircle s, the area T, the radii of the circumcircle and the circumcircle are ra, rb, rc, and where r and r are the radii of the circumcircle and the circumcircle respectively, if and only if At least one of the following eight statements is true
 ye sabhi sambahu tribhuj ke gundharm bhi hai
 There are three types of intersecting lines in a triangle which are similar in equilateral triangle
 sambahu tribhuj kaa prayek tribhuj kendra iske kendrak ke saath sannipatit hota hai or kuch tribhuj kendron ke sannipatit hona isaki upapatti ke liye paryaapt he ki tribhuj sambahu he
 Especially if any two of circumcircle center, inner center, nucleus, perpendicular center etc
 are contiguous, then that triangle is equilateral triangle
 kisi bhi tribhuj ke liye, teenon madhyikaon ke vibhaajan se chah chote tribhuj banate hai
 An equilateral triangle can be easily constructed with the construct
 iske liye ek sidhi rakhaa khincho or parkaar kaa ek chor rekha ke ant main rakho, ab prakaar ke duusare chor ko rekha ke duusare bindu ant tak badhaao or ek chaap ke rup main parkaar ko ghumaao
 Repeat the same process at the other point
 antatah is rekha ke donon ant binduon ko chaapon ke kaat bindu se sidhe jodo
 Alternative Method: ek vrutt kaa nirmaan karo jisaki trigya r he, is vrutt ke kisi bhi bindu par parkaar kii sui rakho or samaan trigya kaa doosraa vrutt banaao
 The two circles intersect at two points
 in donon binduon main se kisi ek ko dono vritton ke kendron se milaane tathaa donon vritton ke kendron ko aapas main milaane par sambahu tribhuj praapt hota he
 This triangle of its origin will be equilateral, can be found in the first part of the book of Euclidean component

 In front of the king, Bhuvan lodged his protest against harsh rent
 captain rassal ko yah pasand nahi aayaa or usne bhuvan ko cricket khilne kii chunauti di
 Forgive the year's revenue if you win, lose three times the rent !!! The villagers wanted to face this challenge, but Captain Russell only gave this decision in the hands of Bhuvan
 chunauti ko or badhaate, teen saal kaa lagaan maaf karne kaa bhi laalach de diya
 Bhuvan accepted the invitation to fight on the ground
 ab sara champaner maano bhuvan ko suuli par chadhaana chahta tha
 Everyone's life was going to be destroyed now
 magar bhuvan ke liye to jab tak saans tab tak aas
 The drought was going on for many years
 aakhir ek saal kaa lagaan bhi to kahaan se bharte? or phir captain rasal bhi to chunauti se nahin hatane vaale the
 Receiving Bhuvan, he made a wooden bat and ball
 kuch gine-chune logon kaa dal chhodkar, sara gaanv bhuvan ke khel par hans rahaa tha
 This team started to go to the camp secretly after learning of cricket
 vahaan captain rasal kii bahan olizabath ne unako jhaadeeyon main chhipe dekh liya
 He did not like his brother's dealings with the villagers
 vah gaanv ke khilaadiyon ko gaanv ke najadik maidan par cricket sikhaane lagi
 a servant would also bring with him from the cantonment for Hindi translation
 dhire-dhire, sahaj-sahaj, bhuvan kaa ye dal apane apurv dhang se cricket kaa khel seekhney lagi
 They used to cut wood to strengthen their hands
 filding seekhney murgiyon kaa peechha kar unhe pakadtey
 The bullet began to bowl, twisting its hands like a windmill

 But how would the village adopt an untouchable? They do not even touch it
 gaanv or sadiyon se chali is parampara kii bhuvan ne aalochana kii
 The residents of the village agreed with Bhuvan's heartfelt words
 akhir muqaabale kaa din jaagaa
 People came from all over the province to watch the game
 captain rasal ke varisht afsar bhi maujuud the
 The game was decided for three days
 gaanvvasion ne pehle gend fankna shuru kiya
 He had a good beginning
 jald hi ek ranaute se vikat giri
 Another blonde player was out after being stunned by the unique ball of the shot
 magar british khilaadi bhi kam na the
 Slowly he continued to handle the innings
 achaanak kachra gend ghumaane se rahaa
 Lakha also lost many catches
 pehle din ke ant main gori toli haaavee thi
 That night, Elizabethan saw Lakha meeting Captain Rasel in the camp
 ab pataa chalaa kii lakh gaanvvaalon se gaddari kar rahaa tha
 Alizabath used to train the villagers with Cricet, he told this to Captain Rasel
 yah bhi bataaya kii kach bhi jaanboojh kar gawaae
 When the villagers came to know, they wanted to remove the skin of Lakha
 unse bhaag nikle lakh ne gaanv ke mandir main panaah lee
 Lakha confessed that he was deceived by jealousy of Bhuvan
 vah bhi bhuwan kii tarah gauri ko chahta tha magar gauri bhuvan ko pasand karti thi
 One chance and Lakha were given
 agle din lakh ne zabardast kach kiye
 Garbage also started running its magic again
 us ne ek saath teen gendon main teen vikaten lee
 The Whites' innings ended at about three runs
 bhuvan kii toli ne ballebaazi kii joardaar shuruuaat kii
 Deva, a former soldier of the British army, was dismissed from the commission
 phir british khilaadion ne gaanv ke ballebzon kii ninda kar unako akulaayaa or ve jald out hone lage
 The second day ended and the half-runs were yet to be scored
 udhar aadhi team out ho chuki thi
 But Bhuvan was still alive in the game
 tisare din gaanv ke baid ishwar kaaka ne or ismail ne bhuvan kaa saath diya
 Ismail was hurt the previous day
 bahut javaabdari se dono ne ballebaazi kii
 Both were run-out
 ab kachra ne ballebaazi sanbhali
 Bhuvan tried very hard to handle more batting
 akhrari gend par kachra ko chha rano kii zarurat thi
 But he was able to take only one run
 kya gaanvvaale haare? ampaire ne no-ball kaa ishaara kiya

 When the civil war started intensifying in Syria, the two Kurdish political parties, the Kurdish Democratic Union Party and the Kurdish National Council, formed the Kurdish Supreme Committee in Rojava, which was now the supreme governing body here, separating from the other opposing factions
 Under Kurdish Army People's Protection Unit was formed in 2012, it drove the Syrian army from Rojava

 The word church is a corruption of the Greek adjective literally meaning "of the Lord"
 vastav main carch do arthon main prayukt he; ek to prabhu kaa bhawan arthath girjaghar tathaa doosraa, isaayiyon kaa sanghathan
 In addition to the church, the term 'congregation' also operates
 yah unani bible ke 'eklesia' shabd kaa vikrut rup he; bible main iskaa arth he - kisi sthanvishesh athwa vishwa bhar ke isaayiyon kaa samudaay
 Later this word started being used for the church as well

 All Christians often agree that Jesus established only one church, but the unity of Christians could not remain intact for many reasons
 falswaroop aajkal unke bahut se carch athwa sanghathan vartmaan hai jo ek duusare se purnataya swatantra hai
 They can be classified as follows: isai dharm kii praarambhik shatabdiyon main carch kii paribhaasha tathaa uske swaroop ke vishay main apekshaakrit kam chintan kiya gaya he
 It is clear from the description of the life and teaching of Jesus in the Bible that from the very beginning Christians believed that Christianity provided the means of salvation for all mankind and for this purpose established "kingdom of God" on earth did
 "ishwar kaa rajya" un logon kaa samudaay he jo isa ke ishwartv par vishwaas kar unki shiksha grahan karte hai
 In the Bible, that community is called "god to the people"
 uske sanghathan tathaa shashan ke liye isa ne 12 shishyon ko chunakar unhen vishesh shikshan tathaa adhikaar die or aadesh diya ki ve duniya bhar main jaakar unki shiksha kaa prachaar karen tathaa vishwaas karanevaalon ko baptism sanskaar karke carch main sammilit kar len
 Thus, in the Bible, the community of followers of Jesus is called the church, "the kingdom of God" and "the people of God"
 in padon se aisa prathit ho saktaa he ki prarambh main carch ke vaastavik rup ko bahari sanghathan tak simit mana gaya he, kintu aisi baat nahin he
 Jesus has emphasized in his teaching that there is invisible and mystical unity between him and his true followers
 unhone apane shishyon se kaha- "main draksha lata hoon or tum daaliyaan ho
 "this makes it clear that the most important element of the church is spiritual
 sant paulus ne carch ke is aadhyatmik tathaa rahasyatmak paksh par bahut bal diya he
 In his letters, he has repeatedly called the Church "the spiritual body of Christ" to illustrate the spiritual connection of Jesus and his true followers and the mysterious unity of all followers of Jesus
 at: prarambh hi se carch ke bahari sanghathan tathaa uske aadhyatmik swaroop, donaan kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 When the Church broke out due to Protestant religion, the religious people began to think more about the nature of the church
 protestant vidvan carch ke adrishy swaroop par or pratikriyaswaroop katholic dharmapandit carch ke bahari sanghathan, uski drishy sadsyta aadi par adhik bal dene lage
 In this controversy, he has given more importance to the four external characteristics of the church
 isa kaa sachcha carch katholic he ; ek he, prem ke bandhan main ek hokar uske sabhi sadsy ek se dharmasiddhanton par vishwaas karte hai
 One accepts the sacrament, the same worshiping ritual and the rule of the same goddess; Is holy; Has apposles carch ke drishy sanghathan main kuch aise log bhi sammilit ho sakate hai jo paakhandee hai, jinka isa ke saath koi aadhyatmik sambandh nahin he, jo isa ke aadhyatmik sharir ke ang nahin hai
 God only knows who is a true member of the church and for this reason it can be assumed that the real church is invisible
 phir bhi us adrishy vaastavik carch kii purna sadsyta kii anivaary shart bahari sanskaar hi hai, at: adrishy carch se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Nowadays, almost all Protestants also believe this
 mukti ke liye carch kii purna sadsyta apekshit hote hue bhi anivaary nahin he
 God wants the salvation of all people and produces inspiration in the conscience of all human beings
 jo ishwar kii prerana par chalate hai ve anjaane hi adrishy rup se carch ke apurna sadsy ban jate hai or isa dwaara pradutt mukti praapt kar sakate hai
 After the Second World War, the movement for unity of the Church in the Christian world began to be given more importance
 falswaroop khandan-mandan ko chhodkar bible main vidyaman tatwon ke aadhaar par carch ke vaastavik rup ko nirdhaarit karne ke prayaas main isapar apekshaakrit adhik bal diya jane laga ki carch isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir he
 Jesus is its head and true Christians are parts of that body
