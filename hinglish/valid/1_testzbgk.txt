dhyatavya he ki adarsh transafarmar urja yaa shakti utpann nahin karata, na hi shakti kaa parivartan karata he, na hi aavriti badalata he
 Transformer used in the field of electricity sambhavat: sarvaadhik vyapak rup se upyog main aanevaala Vaidyut is Sacritra
 udyogon main disht dhara kii apeksha prayavarti dhara ko jo pramukhataa he uskaa sara shrey keval parinamitra ko he
 This is a device that results in a high current of low voltage and low current of high voltage and high current of low voltage
 yah parenaaman urja kii nunatam haani se or saadhitra main bina kisi gatiman bhaag kii sahaayta ke sampann ho jaataa he
 a 100 ampere current is required for the elimination of 10,000 watts of 100 volts
 par 10,000 kii voltata par keval ek ampiore dhara paryaapt hoti he
 Therefore, in the second case, the diameter is much less than the first and due to this, cheaper conductor is required
 parinamitra kaa kaarysanchalan micel farede kii ek adwitiya khoj par aadhaarit he, jiske anusaar paripath main prerit vidyutvahak bal, paripath dwaara paribaddh kshetra ke aarpaar chumbakeey flux ke parivartan kii samay dar ke ke baraabar hota he
 In simplest form, the transformer consists of two separate coils, which have the same magnetic circuit
 shakti ke pravaah kii disha ke anusaar parinamitra ke kundalanon kaa abhinirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Connect the primary coil to the source of alternating current and the secondary to the load
 vidyucchumbakeey preran dwaara urja praathmik kundali se dwitiyak kundalan main sthanantarit hoti he
 The characteristics of operation of an ideal transformer are: vyavahaarat: yah adarsh sthiti dushprapya he
 The feed voltage associated with the primary coil of the transformer produces magnetic flux, which is connected to the plated core of the transformer
 parinamitra ke praathmik kundali se judi hui prayavarti voltata Ep ko ucchtam chumbakeey flux ke ghanatv Bm, patlit crode kii anuprastha kaat kaa kshetrafal A, prayavarti dhara kii aavrirti dhara kii aavriti f tathaa praathmik kundali main lapeton ko sankhya N1 ke padon main vyakt kiya jaataa he: The alternating magnetic flux generated by the current flowing in the primary coil also correlates with the wraps of the secondary coil
 praathmik or dwitiyak kundaliyon main antar keval lapeton kii sankhya kaa hota he, at: dwitiyak kundali main prerit voltata kaa prabhavi maan Thus the following ratio of primary and secondary voltage is obtained: praathmik kundali kii voltata ko badhaane ke aavashyaktaa padane par praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sakhya N1 ko dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se kam rakhaa jaataa he
 This type of transformer is called a high transformer and if the voltage of the primary coil is greater than the voltage of the secondary, then the number of wraps in the primary coil N1 will be larger than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 Generally the nature of the transformer is determined by the following: saamaanya lod par saadhaaran shakti parinamitra kii dakshata bahut adhik hoti he, jo chote uniton main 90 pratishat se lekar bade parinamitron main 98 pratishat tak vicharit hoti he
 General: The efficiency of the transformer expressed in percent can be expressed as: parinamitron kii taatkaalik dakshata or din bhar kii dakshata main antar hota he
 The control of the transformer means the relation of secondary voltage in the case of full load and secondary voltage in case of no load when the input voltage is constant
 pratishat ke rup main vyakt karne par niyantran ko adholikhit rup main paribhaashit kar sakate hai: Controls are of the order of 2 to 5 percent for small transformers and about 1 percent for elders
 transafarmar ke mukhyatah do bhaag hote hai: 1) Core - which is made of a magnetic material
 2) vinding - jo tanba, almunium yaa kisi anya suchalak ke taron athwa bas-baar se banaayi jaati he
 Apart from this, bad conductors are also used which prevent winding wheels from touching each other or from the core
 transformar tel kaa prayog ucch voltata ke parinamitron main kiya jaataa he jo brakedown shakti adhik hone se spark aadi rokte hai tathaa kor va kundliyon se ushma sokhkar use thanda karte hai
 Apart from oil and many other coolants are also used to keep the transformer cool, such as water and gas etc
 neeche kuch udiyaman praudyogiki kii suchi di gayi he
 Emerging techniques are innovative techniques; They have the potential to cause upheaval in the technological world - they can lag behind previously frozen solidification techniques
 udhaaharan ke liye soochna praudyogiki aisi hi ek takneekee he jo pehle hi uthal-puthal kar chuki he
 Similarly, artificial intelligence which comes only inside information technology, also has a strong ability to create turmoil
 bhikiasann vikaas khand uttrakhand rajya ke almoda janapad kaa ek saamudayik vikaas khand he
 The philosophy of Emanuel Kant, is called "critical philosophy", "altruism", or "altruism suffragism"
 is darshan main gyaanashktiyon kii samiksha prastut kii gai he
 Also, there is a review of the 17th and 18th centuries of intellectualism and rationalism
 vichaarsaamagree ke arjan main idriyon kii madhyamikta kii sweekruti main kaant indriyavaadiyon se sahamat tha; ukt saamagree ko vichaaron main parinat karne main buddhi kii anivaaryta kaa samarthan karne main vah buddhivaadiyon se sahamat tha; kintu vah ek kaa niraakaran kar duusare kaa samarthan karne main kisi se sahamat na tha
 In Kant's opinion, intellect and senses are not two separate institutions of knowledge, but two different components of the same body
 kaant ke darshan ko "paratavaad" kehane kaa aashay use indriyavaad tathaa buddhivaad se "par" tathaa prayek darshanik vivechan ke liye aadharbhoot maananaa he
 In his philosophy, the intellect itself has been tested and not in a subject known and very vivid
 europea darshan ke vistrut itihaas main, pratham or antim baar, kaant ke madhyam se, gyaanashktiyon ne swayan kii vyakhya itane vistaar se prastut kii he
 The first directive of this type of interpretation was received from Socrates in Greek philosophy
 usne kaha tha: "apane aapako jaano", kintu uske baad apane aapako jaanane ke jitne praytn kiye gaye sabakaa paryavsaan apane se bahm vastuon ke gyaan main hi hota rahaa
 At the beginning of the modern period, the French thinker Dekart again said forcefully - senses are not worthy of belief, they cause confusion; Wisdom is also not worthy of absolute belief, it proves untrue decisions; But "I think, therefore i am", is a belief whose every refutation proves its truth
 par, kisi vichaarak ne us gyaanadhikaran "main", athwa buddhi ke jatil santhaan kii chaanbin nahin kii
 The trends of the era were beset by the influences of mathematics and physics
 ticobrahi or kopernicus ne ganit ke sahare sadaa se sansar ke centre main baithi hui prithvi ko dhakelkar uske sthaan par surya ko baitha diya tha
 The Galileans, on the other hand, had researched the twofold motion of the earth, dropping stones from the top of the tilted column of Pisa
 europea vichaarak inhen donon prabhaavon ke antargat do dalon main bantkar, gyansamrajya par buddhi athwa indriyon ke ekadhikaar kaa samarthan kar rahe the
 On the one hand, the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm was a follower of the Leibnitz, on the other, a supporter of the British thinker John Locke
 kintu, yug kii dasha dekhakar scotland ke ndehwaadee kahe janevaale vichaarak david hum ne phir poocha, kaaranta ke samarthan kaa aadhaar kahan he? ghatnaon ke jaal main keval purvapar sambandh, sahagaman aadi ke atirikt kuch bhi pratyaksh kaa vishay nahin he
 This time, Kant's talent woke up and he began testing intelligence
 1770 i
 se 1781 i
 tak usne shuddh buddhi ke kaaryon par chintan kar, "critic der rinen vernunfat" ke madhyam se ghoshit kiya ki shuddh buddhi andrik pradatton kaa sanshleshan karti hai
 That is why two types of elements are available to intellectualize and at the subtle analysis of every scientific decision
 ukt samiksha ke pratham bhaag main usne andrik bodh kaa vivechan karte hue, indriyon dwaara bahya jagat se laai hui saamagree or uske bodh ke swabhaav main, samavisht rup main, antar kiya
 He explained that the effect that external objects have on the senses is free from passages of country and time, but, sensory perception is not possible without these passages
 is prakaar usne nirnit kiya ki ye bodh ke do rup hai, jinhen prayek bodhsamagree ko indriyadvaron main pravesh karte hi grahan karnaa padataa he
 Kant called the primordial element, stabilizing the country and time in an inverted shape
 bahya jagat se ai hui saamagree main itnaa roopaantar ho chukne par buddhi kaa doosraa vibhaag, arthbodhvibhag apana kaam prarambh karata he
 The functions of this department are discussed in the second part of the Intelligence Review, "on Analysis"
 vah desh or kalbodh se yukt saamagree par 12 oopaadhiyon kaa aarope karata he
 Kant divided the 12 titles of Arthabodha into four groups
 ekta, bahuta or samshti kii oopaadhiyaan parimansuchak hai; satta, nishedh or sasimta kii oopaadhiyaan gunasuchak hai; vyapti-adhi-kritatv, kaaranta nirbharta or samuhikta sambandhsuchak hai; sambhaavna asambhaavna, astitv anstitv, anivaaryta aakasmikta prakaarta kaa bodh karaati hai
 There are 12 types of intellectual judgments available as a result of the charge of the above 12 titles - general, specific and unanimous are judgments of magnitude, confessional, injunctive and asymptotic decisions make merits; Absolute, relative and alternative relationships make sense of problematic, descriptive and skeptical decisions
 is prakaar kaant ne sthir kiya ki bahya jagat kaa gyaan praapt karne main buddhi andrik saamagree main itnaa roopaantar kar detii he ki indriyadvaron main pravisht hone ke pashchaat jagat kaa rup pehle jaisaa nahin rah jaataa
 Therefore, he had to distinguish between the intellectual object and the external object
 buddhi ke anushaasan se mukti vastu kii usne "newmena" or ukt anushaasan main jakadi hui vastu kaa "fenomena" sangya di
 This difference was meant to show that after the intellectual transformation, the true known object becomes destructive
 ab tisare bhaag main, jise usne "paradwaitiki" sheershak diya tha, usne bataaya ki indriyon kii sahakaarita ke abhaav main saadhanheen shuddh buddhi ishwar, aatma tathaa vishwasamshti kaa gyaan praapt karne main asamarth he
 However, Kant's aim was not to enforce "ignorance" by proving the intellect incompetent in the knowledge of the above subjects
 atev kaant ne saat varsh apane shuddh buddhi kii samiksha ke antim nirnay par athak chintan kiya
 At last, he saw the path of wisdom to move forward
 falat: san 1788 i
 main, usne duusari samikshapustak prakashit kii
 This was a "review of practical intelligence"
 saat varsh purv shuddh ke liye aatma, paramatma or vishwasamshti ke jo agam kshetra the, unamem vyaavhaarik buddhi ne, naitik anubhav kaa pathey lekar, pravesh kiya
 Kant's practical intelligence was not limited to the external nature and to the laws of his nature, just like the pure intellect
 vah swatantra bauddhik vyakti kii buddhi thi, jo swatan: apana niyaman karne main samarth thi
 This does not mean that Kant wanted to support Habs's individualism with the theory of practical intelligence
 usne vyaavhaarik buddhi ko swashaasan kii swatantraaa pradaan kii thi, kintu aise niyamon ke anusaar, jinka anusaran vishwa maanav ke liye uchit ho
 To understand this level of Kant's philosophy, there is a need to understand the difference between charitableness and behavior on the one hand and the distinction between theoretical and moral intelligence on the other
 vah parmarth ko gyanatmak vyapaar kii paridhi se "par" maanata tha, isiilie saidhantik chintan kii samiksha prastut, jo satya he, "vyavhaar" main, jo praatibhasik he, parinat ho jaataa he
 However, in his view moral thinking is far from theoretical thinking; Because he is free from doctrinal restrictions
 isliye, naitik chintan un vishyon tak pahunch saktaa he jo saidhantik chintan ke liye duruh hai
 What Kant calls practical intelligence is literally moral intelligence, the intellectual human's free will power
 isi prasang main kaant ne aatma ke amartv kii or ishwar ke astitv kii pun: sthapana kii he
 Theoretical thinking can do its work without these existence, but without their imagination, the feet of moral thought cannot be set
 amar aatma kii sweekruti main shaashvat jivan kii sweekruti he; ishwar kii sweekruti karmfaladaata kii sweekruti he
 They may not have any theoretical value, but moral value is very big
 naitik chintan main buddhi kaa kaary aacharan kii samasya par vichaar karnaa he
 That is why Kant called it practical intelligence
 kintu vah anek buddhiyon kaa samarthan nahin kar rahaa tha
 He wanted to show that by discrimination, intelligence develops in different ways, acting according to different rules
 prakruti ke vaigyanik vivechan main vah indriyon kii sahakaarita kii apeksha karti he or apane 14 niyamon kaa prayog karti he
 There she does not support any power that cannot come under the discipline of her 14 contracts
 naitik chintan main pravrutt hote hi vah sankalp kaa rup le leti he or karm kaa poshan karanevaali sattaaon main vishwaas karti he
 Kant's third problem was the representation of the activity of the intellect in the taste of "beautiful"
 vah kaary karne ke liye usne "nirnay kii samiksha" prastut kii
 The time of its coming to light was 1790 AD
 kaant ke anusaar "sundar" kii ore unmukh hote hi buddhi "nirnay" kaa rup le leti he
 He considered "judgment" to be the link between pure intelligence and practical intelligence
 usne prakruti ko shuddh buddhi kaa vishay tehraaya tha or prakruti ke satya kaa avagaahan evam anivaaryta kaa anusandhan uddeshy bataaya tha
 The theme of practical intelligence or resolve was "auspicious" and the experience of freedom
 ab vah nirnay kaa vishay rasanubhuti bataata he or is anubhuti ko anivaaryta tathaa swatantraaa ke madhya kii sthiti maanata he
 Apparently in the decision he wanted to combine reality and ideal
 uske vichaar ko samajhane ke liye hamen sundar sambandhi kalpana ko gyaan or sankalp ke bich rakhana hoga
 He considered "beauty" not merely an object of knowledge, but a pleasant thing, but the pleasure that arises from the observation of "beauty" was considered contagious
 usne "sundar" kii paribhaasha main gun, pariman or prakaarta kaa samavesh tathaa sambandh kaa nishedh kiya he
 This type of ecstasy is not possible without pure intelligence and moral conduct
 isiilie, vah "sundar" kii kalpana ko gyaan or sankalp ke bich kaa nirnay kahata he
 This modern review of Kant did not have as much influence as any modern opinion had on the later ideologies
 uske swatantraaa ke vichaar ne ficte, shelling or hegel ko prabhavit kiya
 Kant's elucidation of the known and known object influenced Schopenhaar
 loje kaa prayojanamulak pratyaywad kaant ke hi darshan kaa fal tha
 Lang, Simel and Waihinger developed their opinions about his psychological and behavioral views

 British thinkers Caird, Green, and Bradley assimilated Kant's influence through Hegel

 Hiranyaksha was an asura who was killed by Varaha Avtari Vishnu
 vah hiranyakashiphu kaa chota bhai tha
 , According to a legend described in the Vishnupurana, the demons had two sons of Adyapurusha Kashyapa and his wife Diti
 hiranyakashiphu or hiranyaksh
 Hiranyaksha took the mother earth to the abyss, to protect it, Adi Narayana Lord Vishnu took the Varaha avatar, it is said that the Varaha avatar was born from the nose of Brahma
 kuch manyataon ke anusaar yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki hiranyaksh or varah avatar main kai varshon tak yuddh chalaa 
 Because the demon himself can take the earth into the abyss, you think how much power it will have? Then Hiranyaksha was killed by the sound of slap being killed by the Varaha avatar

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm ek dharm he jiske anuyaayi adhikanshtah bharat ,nepal or morishas main bahumat main hai
 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"

 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect

 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent

 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai
 Five major deities are revered in Hinduism beliefs
 ye ek ishwar ke hi alag-alag rup or shaktiyaan hai
 Jupiter is considered the guru of the gods

 He attained the position of Devguru through the hard tenacity of Lord Shiva

 He is also revered as a Guru planet by the grace of Shiva

 Shukracharya, the guru of the demons, is considered
 brahmadev ke putr maharishi bhrigu inke pita the
 It was Shukracharya who received the dead Sanjivani Vidya by performing harsh penance of Shiva, by which he used to burn his life again in the dead body
 brahmadev kii krupa se yah shukr grah ke rup main poojaneey hai

 hindu dharm ke anusaar har chetan praani main ek abhautik aatma hoti he, jo sanathan, avyakt, aprameya or vikaar rahit he
 According to Hinduism, not only human beings, but every animal and plant, that is, every living being has a soul
 bhagavadgita main bhagwaan shrikrishna dwaara aatma ke lakshan is prakaar bataae gaye hai: In any birth, according to the deeds done freely, the soul assumes the next body
 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina
 janm maran kaa sansaarik chakra tabhi khatm hota he jab vyakti ko moksh miltaa he
 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever
 maanav yoni hi akelaa aisa janm he jisamen manushya ke karm, paap or punyamay fal dete hai or sukarm ke dwaara moksh kii prapti mumkin he
 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai 
 The major Smriti texts are: History - Ramayana and Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, Purana -, Manusmriti, Dharmashastra and Dharmasutra, Agam Shastra

 People believe that the person who travels to these four dhams gets blessed
 zyaadaatar hindu bhagwaan kii murtiyon dwaara puja karte hai
 For them, the idol is a simple instrument, in which the same formless God can be seen in any beautiful form as he wishes
 hindu log vastav main pathar or lohe kii puja nahin karte, jaisaa ki kuch log samajhate hai
 Idols are merely a means for Hindus to do devotion to God

 There were no temples during the ancient Vedic period
 tab upasna agni ke sthaan par hoti thi jisamen ek sone kii murti ishwar ke pratik ke rup main sthapit kii jaati thi
 According to one view, due to the worship of Buddha and Mahavira idols and temples by Buddhist and Jain religions, Hindus too started building temples after being influenced by them
 har mandir main ek yaa adhik devataaon kii upasna hoti he
 The idol of the presiding deity is revered in the sanctum sanctorum
 mandir pracheen or madhyayugin bhartiya kala ke shreshthatam pratik hai
 Millions of pilgrims visit the temples every year

 On the basis of this principle, the prevention of the disease is done successfully by producing vaccine-resistant immunity by artificial vaccines

 The microscopic introduction of vaccines that are mainly used for the prevention of disease is as follows: chechak ke vishaanu ko vairiyola kehete hai
 This vaccine has been used since ancient times for vaccines

 unhen 'maan singh pratham' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 King Bhagwandas was the father
 vah akbar kii sena ke pradhan senapati, the
 He built the main palace of Amer
 mahaan itihaaskaar karnal james tod ne likhaa he- " bhagwaan das ke uttaradhikari maansingh ko akbar ke darbar main shreshth sthaan mila tha
 

man Singh conquered Orissa and Assam and made them under Emperor Akbar
 Fearing King Mansingh, Kabul also had to accept Akbar's subjection
 apane in kaaryon ke falswaroop maansingh bengal, bihar, dakshin or kabul kaa shaasha niyukt hua tha
 " jab akbar ke senapati maansingh sholapur maharashtra vijay karke laut rahe the, to maansingh ne pratap se milane kaa vichaar kiya
 Pratap was in Kumbhalgarh at that time
 apni rajyasima mewar ke bheetar se guzarane par maharana pratap ko unke swaagat kaa prabandh udaipur ke udaisagar kii paal par karnaa padaa
 swaagat-satkar evam paraspar baatcheet ke baad bhojan kaa samay bhi aayaa
 Maharaja Mansingh came for food but was surprised to see Maharana
 unhone maharana ke putr amarsingh se iskaa kaaran poocha to usne bataaya ki 'maharana sahab ke sir main dard he, atah ve bhojan par aapkaa saath dene main main asamarth hai
 ' kuch itihaaskaaron ke anusaar yahi ghatana haldi ghati ke yuddh kaa kaaran bhi bani
 Akbar got another chance to attack Mewar due to this behavior of Rana Pratap

 a large army of Mughals rode towards Mewar like a locust
 usamen mughal, rajput or pathan yoddhaon ke saath akbar kaa jabardast topakhana bhi tha

 san 1576 i
 ke 21 june ko gogunda ke paas haldi ghati main pratap or mogul sena ke bich ek din ke is bhayankar sangram main satraa hazaar sainik maare gaye
 It was here that a fierce battle between the two took place when Rana Pratap and Mansingh came face-to-face - Pratap, riding on Chetak's back, placed the black-blue, Arabic-bred horse Chetak's feet on the head of the elephant of Akbar's commander Mansingh and With his spear, he made a catastrophic attack on King Mansingh, but immediately after sitting down in the elephant's strong cistern, his life was saved in this war - Huda Pratap's misdeeds and Turned badly and
 baad main jab gambhir ghayal hone par rana pratap jab haldighati kii yubhumi se dur chale gaye, tab raja maansingh ne unke mehalon main pahunch kar pratap ke prasiddh haathiyon main se ek hathi ramprasad ko duusari lut ke saamaan ke saath agra-darbar bheja
 But knowing that Mansingh had not given permission to loot the city of Chittorgarh, Emperor Akbar was very angry at them and even banned their arrival in the court for some time
 james tod ke shabdon main- "jin dinon main akbar bhayanak rup se biimaar ho kar apane marane kii ashanka kar rahaa tha, maansingh khusro ko mogul singhaasana par bithaane ke liye shadyantron kaa jaal bicha diya tha
 

 His efforts became known to everyone in the court and he was sent as the ruler of Bengal
 uske chale jane ke baad khusro ko kaid karke karagaar main rakhaa gaya
 Mansingh was clever and visionary
 vah chhipe taur par khusro kaa samarthan karata rahaa
 maansingh ke adhikaar main bees hazaar rajputon kii sena thi
 Therefore the emperor did not appear enmity with him
 Some historians have written- "akbar made Mansingh friendly by giving ten crores of rupees
 " In the reign of Akbar, when King Bhagwantdas was appointed the Subedar of Punjab, the frontier province was passed over Sindh to his Kunwar Mansingh
 jab 30wein varsh main akbar ke sautele bhai mirza mohammad hakeem kii mrityu ho gai, tab maansingh ne aagyaanusaar furti se kabul pahunch kar vahaan ke nivaasiyon ko shaasha ke nidhan ke baad utpann lutpaat se nijaat dilwaai or uske putr mirza afarussiyab or mirza kankuwaad ko rajya ke anya saradaaron ke saath le kar ve darbar main aae
 Akbar stayed a few days on the Sindh river and appointed Kunwar Mansingh as the ruler of Kabul
 inhone badi bahaduree ke saath rushani luteron ko, jo vidrohpurvak khaybar ke darre ko roke hue the, kaa safaya kiya
 This task was entrusted to Mansingh when King Birbal was killed in the battle of Yusufzai in the province of Svara and Zanakhan Koka and Hakim Abul Fatah were called to the court
 afghanistan main jabulistaan ke shashan par pehle pita bhagwantdas niyukt hue or baad main par unke kuker maansingh
 After the death of King Bhagwandas, King Mansingh sat on the throne of Jaipur
 Colonel James Tod has written- "the Amber state made great progress during the reign of Mansingh
 Honoring in the Mughal court, Mansingh expanded his kingdom
 He invaded many kingdoms and looted the infinite wealth of the Amer kingdom
 Made powerful
 After Dhaularay, Amer, which was considered a minor state, became a powerful and elaborate state at the time of Mansingh
 bharatvarsh ke itihaas main kushwahon ko shoorveer nahin mana gaya par raja bhagwaan das or maansingh ke samay kushwaha logon ne khutan se samudr tak apane bal, parakram or vaibhav kii pratishtha kii thi
 Mansingh was certainly under Akbar, but the Rajput army working with him was considered more powerful than the king's army "
 karnal james tod kii is baat se duusare kuch itihaaskaar sahamat nahin
 unka kathan he maansingh bhagwaan das kaa god liya putr nahin tha, balki vah to bhagwant das kaa ladkaa tha
 Bhagwandas and Bhagwant Das were both brothers

"muslim historians have written that Mansingh died in Bengal in 1615 AD in Hijri 1024 AD, but the description of other historians suggests that Mansingh went to the north to battle with the Khilji emperor where he was killed in 1617 AD

 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans

 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction

 Symbian OS was created with three system design principles in mind: in siddhanton kaa sarvshereshth tareeke se paalan karne ke liye, simbian ek sookshmakarnal kaa upyog karata he, sevaaon ke prati iske paas request-and-colbach drushtikon he or ingine or upyogkarta interfes ke bich duuri banaae rakhata he
 The OS is optimized for low power battery based devices and ROM based systems
 anuprayog or swayan OS ek vastu unmukh dizin kaa paalan karte hai: model-vyuu-controlar Subsequent OS iterations slowed this method down, with the introduction of a real-time-kernel and a platform security model in versions 8 and 9, keeping in mind market demand

 In addition, all Symbian programming is event-based and the cpu's switch is put into a low power mode when applications do not directly deal with events

 Symbian's approach to threads and processes is similarly driven by reducing overheads

 Many of these are frameworks, and vendors are expected to supply plug-ins to these frameworks from third parties
 This has the advantage that the apis in such functionality areas are the same on many phone models and this gives vendors great flexibility

 EPOC16, originally known as EPOC, is an operating system developed by Psion that was designed for Psion's "SIBO" device in the late 1980s or early 1990s
 All EPOC16 devices primarily feature an 8086-family processor and a 16-bit architecture
 EPOC16 ek ekal-upyogkarta riktipurv bahukaaryan oparating system tha, jise intel ke 8086 kodantarak bhashaa or c main likhaa gaya or ROM main die jane ke liye dizin kiya gaya

 SIBO devices included the MC200, MC400, Series 3, 3a Series, 3C Series, 3mx Series, Siena, Workabout and Workabout mx
 pehle EPOC16 upkaran, MC400 or MC200, kaa nauvahan 1989 main kiya gaya
 EPOC16 was characterized primarily by a 1-bit per pixel, keyboard-driven graphical interface
 
 In the late 1990s, the operating system was referred to as EPOC16 to distinguish between it and Psion's new EPOC32 OS at the time
 EPOC32 kaa pehla sanskaran, relies 1 1997 main Psion series 5 ROM v1

 The EPOC32 operating system was later renamed Symbian OS, at the time simply known as EPOC
 naamon ko lekar is bhram ke kaaran simbian naam rakhe jane se purv, EPOC16 ko "naye" EPOC se alag karne ke liye SIBO ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Despite the name being the same, EPOC32 and EPOC16 were two completely different operating systems, with EPOC32 being written in c ++ in a new codebase that began development in the mid-1990s
 EPOC32 smriti sangrakshan vaali ek riktipurv bahukaaryan, ekal upyogkarta oparating system tha, jo anuprayog viksit karne vaale ko apane program ko ek ingine or ek interfes main vibhajit karne ke liye protsaahit karata tha
 The Psion line of pdas comes with a graphical user interface called EIKON specifically designed for handheld machines with keyboards
 EPOC32 ko mul rup se processron ke ARM parivaar ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya tha, jisamen shaamil hai ARM 7,ARM9, strongarm or intel kii xscale, lekin kai anya prakaar ke sansaadhakon kaa prayog karke lakshith upkarnon kii ore sankalit kiya ja saktaa he
 During the development of EPOC32, Psion planned to license EPOC to third-party device manufacturers and add an additional product to the software division in the form of Psion software
 One of the first licensees was the short-lived Geofox, which halted production with the sale of only 1000 units
 Ericsson marketed a re-branded Psion Series 5mx called MC218 and later the EPOC release 5
1 based smartphone called R380
 Oregon Scientific also released a budget EPOC device called Oseris
 june 1998 main, Psion software simbian limited ban gaya, jo Psion or phone nirmaataaon jaise Ericsson, Motorola or Nokia ke bich ek pramukh sanyukt udhyam tha
 As of Release 6, EPOC became commonly known as Symbian OS
 1994 ke utraardh main 32-bit sanskaran par kaam shuru kiya gaya
 The series 5 device, released in June 1997, used the first iteration of the EPOC32 OS, with its symbolic names being "protea" and "aecon" graphical user interfaces

 The first phone to use er5u, the Ericsson R380 was released in November 2000
 This was not an 'open' phone - the software could not be installed
 In particular, many Psion's never-released next-generation PDA samples, including the Bluetooth Revo Classroom symbolic name Conan, were using the er5u

 The development of various uis was made common to either 'smartphone' or 'communicator' devices with a "referenced design strategy", further subdivided into keyboard- or tablet-based designs
 Two references were passed to UI Quartz and Crystal
 pehle ko Ericsson ke 'ronebi' dizin ke saath vilay karaayaa gaya or vah UIQ interphes kaa aadhaar ban gaya; doosraa Nokia siries 80 UI ke rup main bazaar pahunchaa
 Later dfrds were Sapphire, Ruby and Emerald
