 parantu koi avyav padap ko kitna mil sakegaa yah kai baton par nirbhar he, jaise vah avyav mitti main kis khanij ke rup main vidyaman he, mitti kaa kitna ansh kalil ke rup main he, mitti main adrrata kitni he or uski amlata kitni he
 Adding nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium to the soil has been found to be useful for most crops, as these elements are extracted in varying amounts by various crops
 isliye yah dekhnaa aavashyak he ki bhoomi ke in tatwon kaa santulan paudhon kii aavashyaktaa ke anusaar hi rahe
 Adding too much of one element can cause a decrease or imbalance in other elements, which can lead to a reduction in yield
 bhartiya bhoomi ke liye khaad ke sabase mahatvapurn ang nitrogen tathaa vanaspatik padaarth hai
 Remember that there is a difference between land and land; Therefore, there is no comprehensive recipe that can be used everywhere in this regard
 nitrogen denevaali kuch vastuen ye hai :- jeevajanik strot : gobar, lid, mutr, kooda karkat aadi kii khaad; khali tathaa hari fasalein jo khaad ke rup main kaam main aa sakati hai, jaise sanai, tinapatiyaa moong, dhencha aadi
 Non-biodegradable sources: Urea, which contains 40 percent nitrogen, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate and sodium nitrate
 saadhaaran: bhoomi main prati acre 50 se 12 pound tak nitrogen santoshjanak hone kii aashaa kii ja sakati he
 It is possible that phosphorus will remain in sufficient quantity in the soil, but plants may only acquire slowly
 dekha gaya he ki kabhi-kabhi jahaan anya fasalein bahut hi nikammi hoti thim, vahaan falon kaa udyaan bhoomi main bina upar se fasphoras padaarth daale, bahut acchhee tarah phulataa faltaa he, sambhavat: isliye ki fal ke vrikshon ko fasphoras kii aavashyaktaa dhire-dhire hi padati he
 Phosphorus is present in fertilizers and all types of organisms
 parantu fasphorasprad vishesh vastuen ye hai-asthiyon kaa churna, basic slag or super phosphate jiskaa prayog bahutayat se hota he
 It contains 16 to 40 percent phosphorus pentaoxide
 un mittayon main, jo fasphoras ko sthir kar leti hai, pehali baar itnaa fasphorasmay padaarth daalana chahie ki sthir karne par bhi paudhon ke liye kuch fasphoras bachaa rahe, parantu jo mittyaan fasphoras ko sthir nahin karatin unamem adhik maatra main fasphorasmay padaarth nahin daalana chahie, anyathaa santulan bighad jayega or anya avyav kam pad jaayenge
 In a land where the amount of accessible potassium is very small, there is a visible difference in giving potassium, which is evident by the increase in yield
 potashium sulphate tathaa potacium chloride hi saadhaarant: khaad ke liye prayukt hote hai
 Each of these contains about 50 percent potassium oxide
 potacium nitrate main 44 pratishat potacium oxide hota he; saath main 13 pratishat nitrogen bhi rahata he
 Organic fertilizers may also contain 50 percent or more of potassium oxide
 sahibajada mohammad fazal-i-kareem ek raajnneetijna he pakistan ke rashtriya vidhansabha main | vah NA-82 nirvachan kshetra kaa pratinidhitiv karata he pakistani punjab ke liye | a total of 33 inscriptions by the Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty have been unearthed which Ashoka carved into the walls of columns, rocks and caves during his reign from 269 BC to 231 BC

 Yes, as a result of his patronage, Buddhism was widely spread in his empire and other states
 Happened
 buddha dharm failaane ke liye ashok ne bharat ke sabhi logon main or unani raajaaon ko bumadhya sagar tak doot bheje
 On their columns are written the exact names of many contemporary Greek rulers from their Greece to North Africa, which indicates that they were monitoring the political situation thousands of miles away from India: har yojan lagbhag saat mile hota he, isliye 600 yojan kaa arth lagbhag 4,000 mile he, jo bharat ke centre se lagbhag yunaan ke centre kii duuri he
 The rulers described here are as follows: unani sroton se saafe gyaat nahin hota kii yah doot in raajaaon se vastav main mili bhi kii nahin or unani kshetra main inkaa kya prabhaav hua
 Nevertheless, some scholars consider the presence of the Buddhist community in Greek regions to be a sign of some degree of success of Ashoka's apostles

 For 'gender' related to grammar, see gender
 jeevigyaan main ling se taatpary un pahachaanon yaa lakshanon se jinke dwaara jeevajgat main nar ko maadaa se pruthak pahachaanaa jaataa he
 Animals have innumerable animals that cannot be called males, or females, only by external markings
 nar tathaa maadaa kaa nirnay do prakaar ke chihnon, praathmik or gaun langik lakshanon, dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In the botanical world, the distinction between male and female, like developed beings, is not found separately

 Today in Hindi, the word Linga means gender, but in the original Sanskrit, it means the sign, symbol or symptom

 If we see the history of reproduction, it will be known that the origin of the world's living organisms originated in an asexual way; For example, in many forms of protozoa and protophyta, males and females did not create together
 in jeevon kii utpatti sharir vikhandan, mukulan tathaa bijaanu nirmaan dwaara hui
 In the second stage of development, very subtle signs of male and female started appearing

 Secondary sexual traits comprise organs and traits that separate the male and female from their morphology, such as in some vertebrate animals where the mathunangas can be seen as distinct
 nar praani main shishn tathaa maadaa main bhaga maithunang hote hai
 The secondary sexual traits in certain other creatures include mustache, beard, beautiful and flamboyant feathers, head crest, horn, breast, domination, sweet voice, desire for motherhood, attacking capacity etc

 The sex of animals is determined in three ways: nishechan ke pehle hi, At the time of fertilization and nishechan ke baad
 However, the determination of sex is generally considered to be at the time of fertilization
 nar ke shukranu kaa maadaa ke andashay se sanyukt hona nishechan kaha jaataa he
 Fertilized eggs, or zygotes, grow slowly in the environment
 nar tathaa maadaa kaa nirdhaaran kuch jatil prakriyaaon dwaara hota he
 Scientists have presented several theories in this regard
 in siddhanton main nimnlikhit do siddhant apekshaakrit adhik prasiddh hai : gunasutra, yaa chromosome siddhant tathaa hormone siddhant
 According to genetic science, the cells that are found in the body of animals, have some of these compositions that take special types of pigments and stains, these structures are called chromosomes
 anuvanshik vigyaan main visheshkar yugmakon, yaa ling koshikaon main paae jane vaale chromosomon par hi vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The number of chromosomes in the reproductive cells of different animals is found as follows: praani kaa naam --- chromosomon kii sankhya Cycnic Sponge - 26 hydra --- 30 - 32 Leech of Lumbricus dynasty --- 32 uniyo sip --- 32 Taramine --- 36 zinga machhlee --- 48 Scorpion --- 24 ek machhlee --- 24 Beauphotode --- 24 - 26 kacchapagan --- 56 Magar --- 32 bhed --- 60 Horse --- 60 - 66 bandar --- 48 Human --- 46 netrics --- 40 Kapotvansh or Colamba --- 66 murga --- 18 - 20 Bats --- 24 lipas vansh kaa khargosh --- 28 - 36 Dog --- 50 - 78 lomadee --- 38 Cat --- 66 choupaae --- 38 - 60 Goat --- 60 bhainsa --- 48 - 56 Pigs --- 38 - 40 chimpanji --- 48 Camel --- 70 san 1901-2 main macclang naamak vidvan ne chromosome kaa pataa lagaaya
 He also made some theories, which were later confirmed by scientific research
 is siddhant main yah mana jaataa he ki prayek praani ke kuch vishisht chromosomon kii sankhya par uskaa ling nirbhar karata he
 If the composition of chromosomes is seen by a more powerful microscope, such as an electron microscope, then some very microscopic compositions will be seen in it
 inako jin kaha jaataa he or yah vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki ye hi janak ke anuvanshik gunon ko unki santanon tak pahunchaate hai
 There has been much research and experimentation regarding chromosomes and genes of animals and plants
 yah paaya gaya he ki prayek praani kii janan koshikaon main paae janevaale chromosomon main kuch aise hote hai, jinhen alingsutra kehete hai
 They are of a type in both male and female and always live in pairs
 kuch duusare prakaar ke chromosome bhi paae jate hai, jinhen ling nirdharak kaha jaataa he
 The number of chromosomes found so far has been termed as X, Y, W, z and O
 mana jaataa he ki nar tathaa maadaa kaa nirdhaaran inhen linganirdharak chromosomon kii sam tathaa visham sankhya dwaara hota he, jaise manushyon main ling kaa nirdhaaran is prakaar hota he : 21 Alling formula + 1 x + 1 y = male; And 21 aling sutara + 2 eks = stri
 According to the number of chromosomes, the male and female are called heterozygous or homozygous
 kisi praani main nar samayugmaki hoti he, to kisi main maadaa
 Birds, butterflies, fishes, aquatics etc
 have a female heterozygous
 in praaniyon main linganirdharak chromosomon ko zed tathaa dablyoo naam diya jaataa he, jabaki anya praaniyon tathaa vanaspatiyon main inhen eks tathaa vaai ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 In many beings, x and y determine the sex of male or female
 jab eks vaala shukranu maadaa ke andey se sanyukt hota he, tab yugmanaj ko do eks eks milte hai or vah maadaa banataa he
 But when the y of the sperm is combined with the x of the egg of the female, the zygote receives x y, ie an odd number and is male
 manushyon tathaa anya praaniyon ke nar tathaa maadaa ke chromosomon main jo vibhed paaya jaataa he, vah agle prishth kii sarini main dikhaaya gaya he
 Just as chromosomes have been studied in animals, they have also been studied in flora
 adhiktar beej vaale paudhe ubhayalingashrayi hote hai, arthath unamem nar tathaa maadaa ling ek saath hote hai
 Even when chromosomes are counted, gender is only discussed in the context of male-female analysis, because the problem of gender and heredity is not in the botanical world
 kuch jati main nar tathaa maadaa paudhe pruthak hote hai
 x and y chromosomes of such plants have also been detected, such as Ilodia canadensis, Milandrium album etc
 bijwala ek paudha, fregariya ilatior, chidiyon kii bhanti chromosome vaala batalaaya jaataa he
 In some other plants, the male bears two Ys and one x in spite of being heterosexual
 hraas vibhaajan ke samay donon vaai tathaa eks pruthak ho jate hai or do vaai janan koshika se milakar nar tathaa ek eks maadaa bhrun ke rup main parivartit ho jate hai
 Similarly, sex is also determined in other plants
 praaniyon ke sharir main kuch aisi granthiyaan hoti hai jinhen vahinihin yaa ant:sravi kaha jaataa he
 The secretions of these glands, called hormones, have been studied in some developed, especially vertebrate animals
 vanaspatiyon main bhi hormone hote hai yaa nahin, yah vivadagrast vishay he
 Names of glands found in the body of animals are: pituitary, pineal, thyroid gland, parathyroid, thymus, pacius or pancreas, kidney; Gonads, testes in males and ovaries in females
 in grathiyon se nikalne vaale hormonon kaa adhyayan vistaar se kiya gaya he or yah paaya gaya he ki nar praani main purushatv or maadaa main stritv sambandhit gaun langik lakshanon kaa astitv inhen kii kriya par nirbhar karata he
 Genes and chromosomes only determine whether the zygote will be male or female
 vaastavik purushatv or stritv kaa nirdhaaran tathaa uchit disha main unka vikaas vahinihin grathiyon ke sraavon kii sahaayta se hi hota he
 For example, if an embryo is born as a male, then by either dipping the female hormones or castrating it and implanting the ovary glands in its place, it will either become fully female, or develop symptoms of femininity

 All hormones are produced in the body, so when the hormones that determine the femininity, or masculinity, are more powerful, then the fetus will move towards the female, or male body and tendencies
 hormonon ke santulan kaa hi yah parinaam hota he ki praani nar yaa maadaa ke rup main janm letaa he
 Kurt Stern has shown that if a woman has three x in place of two X, then she will have more femininity
 kintu aisi stri der main rituvati, atyadhik alpaayu or sarvatha vandhya hogi
 Similarly, Goldschmidt studies a moth named Limatria japonica, stating that 50% of normal males and 50% of endemic females are produced when strong males are conjugated to weak insects
 kintu jab atyadhik shashakt naron kaa nirbal maadaaon se sanyog hota he tab 100% nar keet utpann hote hai

 The crab whose body it penetrates in, suckles its genitals
 iske kaaran vah vandhya ho jaataa he
 Most crabs die, some males become female with female traits, or female crabs become intracellular and produce both testes and ovaries

 However, it was only after 30 years that advances in molecular chemistry and solid state electronics made it possible to manufacture a cheaper sensor
 jabaki 1960 ke adhikansh dashak ke dauraan gharelu smoke detector uplabdh the, in upkarnon kaa mulya thodaa adhik tha
 Earlier, alarms were so expensive that only major businesses and theaters could afford them

 The first commercial smoke detector became available in the market in 1969
 aaj ve america ke 93% or britain 85% gharon main sthapit hai
 However it is estimated that more than 30% of such alarms do not work at any given time, because users remove the batteries, or forget to replace them

 "furthermore, a study by the alleged NFPA by the State of California A&M and the City of Palo Alto California expresses that," electromagnetic alarms reacted more slowly to fires that spread faster than ionizing alarms
 , But laboratory and field tests have shown that electromagnetic smoke alarms are sufficient for all types of fires Of the individuals who do and give them warning seen very rarely disable them
 " Although optical alarms have been highly effective in detecting smoldering fires and provide adequate protection from blazing fires, fire safety experts and the National Fire Protection Agency recommend installing combination alarms, which are alarms that are either Detects both heat and smoke or uses ionization and electro-optical / optical processes

 is irshyaa kii parinti tisare charan ke rup main saamne aayi
 Third phase 18 April 1948 bundi ke maharav bahadur singh nahin chaahate thea ki unhen apane chote bhai maharav bhimsingh kii rajpramukhataa main kaam karnaa padey, magar bade rajya kii vajah se bhimsingh ko rajpramukh bananaa tatkaaleen bharat sarkaar kii majaburi thi
 When this did not happen, Maharao Bahadur Singh of Bundi defeated the princely state of Udaipur and agreed to merge with the Rajasthan Union
 iske peeche manshaa yah thi ki bady riyasat hone ke kaaran udaipur ke maharana ko rajpramukh banaaya jayega or bundi ke maharav bahadur singh apane chote bhai maharav bhim singh ke adheen rahane kii majaburi se batch jaaege or itihaas ke pannon main yah darj hone se batch jayega ki chote bhai ke raaj main bade bhai ne kaam kiya

 And in this way, the trick of Maharaja of Bundi was also successful
 chauthaa charan tees march 1949 After the formation of the united Rajasthan Union before this, the then Government of India focused its attention on the native princely states of Jodhpur, Jaipur, Jaisalmer and Bikaner and it was also successful and by merging these four princely states, the then Government of India on March 30, 1949, gave the greater Rajasthan Union was formed, which was inaugurated by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the then princely and home minister of the Government of India
 bikaner riyasat ne sarvapratham bharat main vilay kiya
 Today, 30 March is considered to be the day of the establishment of Rajasthan
 is kaaran is din ko har saal rajasthan diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Although the merger of the four princely states was yet to be merged, this merger is not given much importance, because the princely states that were left had merged in independent India under the name of 'matsya Union' in the first phase itself
 alvar, bhatarpur, dhaulpur va karauli naamak in riyasto par bharat sarkaar kaa hi aadhipaty tha is kaaran inke rajasthan main vilay kii to maatr aupchaarikta hi honi thi
 Fifth stage 15 April 1949 pandraa april 1949 ko matsay sandh kaa vilay greater rajasthan main karne kii aupchaarikta bhi bharat sarkaar ne nibhaa di
 When the Matsya Union was formed by the Government of India on March 18, 1948, it was written in the merger letter that later this union would be merged in Rajasthan
 is kaaran bhi yah charan aupchaarikta maatr mana gaya
 Sixth phase 26 January 1950 bharat kaa samvidhan lagu hone ke din 26 janvari 1950 ko sirohi riyasat kaa bhi vilay greater rajasthan main kar diya gaya
 This merger is also considered a formality because the Indian government already had control here
 darasal jab rajasthan ke ekikaran kii prakriya chal rahi thi, tab sirohi riyasat ke shaasha naaballig the
 For this reason, the functioning of the Sirohi State was being looked after by the Council of the Agency headed by the Empress of Dowagadh which was formed to transfer power to India
 sirohi riyasat ke ek hisse abu delvada ko lekar vivaad ke kaaran is charan main abu delvada tehsil ko bombai or shesh riyasat vilay rajasthan main kiya gaya
 Seventh phase one November 1956 ab tak alag chal rahe abu delvada tehsil ko rajasthan ke log khona nahin chaahate the, kyonki isi tehsil main rajasthan kaa kashmir kaha jane vaala abuparvat bhi aata tha, duusare rajasthani, batch chuke sirohi vaasiyon ke rishtedaar or kaiyon kii to jameen bhi duusare rajya main ja chuki thi
 The agitations were being held, the Government of India had to accept the legitimate cause of the agitation and the Abu Delwada tehsil was also merged in Rajasthan
 is charan main kuch bhaag idhar udhar kar bhugolic or saamaajik truti bhi sudhari gaya
 Under this, the Sunel Thapa area, which has been included in Madhya Pradesh, was merged in Rajasthan and Sironj, the sub-district of Jhalawar district was given to Madhya Pradesh
