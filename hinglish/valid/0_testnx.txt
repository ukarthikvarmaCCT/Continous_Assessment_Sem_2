 upabhokta sangrakshan adhinium ko adhikadhik karyrat or prayojanpurn banane ke liye disambar 2002 main ek vyapak sanshodhan laayaa gaya or 15 march 2003 se lagu kiya gaya
 Consequently, the Consumer Protection Rules, 1987 was also amended and notified on 5 March 2004
 bharat sarkaar ne 24 disambar ko rashtriya upabhokta diwas ghoshit kiya he, kyonki bharat ke raashtrapati ne usee din aitihaasik upabhokta sangrakshan adhinium, 1986 ke adhinium ko sweekaara tha
 In addition, 15 March is celebrated every year as World Consumer Rights Day
 yah din bhartiya graahak aandolan ke itihaas main sunahare aksharo main likhaa gaya he
 In India, this day was first observed in the year 2000
 or aage bhi prayek varsh manaaya jaataa he
 The important fact related to the Customer Protection Act is that none of the government parties prepared this bill
 akhil bhartiya graahak panchayat ne prathmat: is vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar kiya
 In 1979, a law committee was formed under the Customer Panchayat

 Govindrao Athawale, hundred
 Swati Shahane was a member of this committee
 purv main graahak panchayat dwaara kiye gaye prayaas graahak panchayat kii sthapana 1947 main hui
 From that time one thing started to come to notice that in every area the customer is being cheated
 uskaa nuksaan ho rahaa he phir bhi uske paas nyaay maangane ke liye koi kanoon nahin tha
 The customer was unable to do anything except to bear it
 saamaanya aarthik paristhitiyon main graahak vyapaaree ke adhik aarthik prabhaav se shoshit hota rahaa tha
 His voice did not reach the regime
 graahak ne anyaay ke viruddh pratikaar kiya to vikreta graahak par lut maar kaa aarope lagane lagate the
 To overcome this situation, the Customer Panchayat enunciated the need for independent legislation for customer protection
 1977 main lonawala main graahak panchayat ke kaaryakartaaon ne baithak main ek prastaav paarit karke aise kanoon kii maang kii
 In 1978, the customer panchayat published a demand letter
 graahak sangrakshan kanoon, graahak mantralay or graahak nyaalay main ye maange rakhi
 The Panchayat itself began drafting legislation in 1980 by drafting legislation on it
 dinaank 9 april 1980 ko kanoon samiti kii pehali baithak main kanoon kaa praaroop samiti ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 After the discussion of the committee, systematic Mousoda was sent to many law experts

 An engineer is responsible for preparing equipment for service, checking paperwork and the condition of the engine
 unke kartavyon main twaran, brake lagaana or train ko andar se niyantran karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 They should be aware of the physical characteristics of the railroad, the velocity and degradation of the passenger stations, the right track and the speed limit
 Along with the conductor, the engineer has to monitor the time so as not to leave behind the fixed time nor leave the station early
 Whenever going behind a train, changing the route or regulating the time to avoid reaching too early, the speed of the train should be kept low
 If the conductor is incompetent, then the engineer should be aware of the conductor's duties
 locomotive ejeeniyar ko trek kii bhumiti sahit signal placement kaa antarang gyaan hona aavashyak he taaki surakshit rup se gaadi par niyantran kiya ja sake
 It is very important to maintain concentration in this role

 It is followed by 1500m wagons
 vaiganon main samaan rup se maal kaa ladaan nahin ho saktaa he or iske brake alag hote hai
 Heavy brake applications can be combined with these factors for splitting a train
 isliye aamtaur par parivahan ke liye maal gadiyon ke sanchaalan kaa abhyaas gathan acha he
 This is achieved by taking into account the strength of its formation while manufacturing the brake and its technical development is done before the locomotive brake is used
 dinemic brake ke upyog se aisa karnaa sambhav nahin he, jab train kii khud sanchaalan chunautiyaan maujuud hon
 When there are multiple locomotives, wagons can be used instead of locomotives to produce some brakes, because the use of excessive locomotives makes the front of the train much heavier than the rest of the application
 yatriyon vaali choti gadiyon par, yah or bhi adhik dhyaan dene yogya he, brake ke anuprayog kii locomotive par takneekee vikaas kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Later locomotive brakes are applied with increased application
 dhimi karne yaa rokane kii duuri kii lambaai yah nirdesh detii he ki kitne locomotive brake anuprayog karne kii anumati honi chahie
 The use of dynamic brakes can lead to overheating, it is very likely to occur during walking if it is brought in inappropriate times, and if improper use during inappropriate times can also lead to run-out, both possibly causing the train's dragier Can be cut
 sidhi line hi paryaapt kaaran he jisase avapathan hota he, train ko sanbhaalane kii takanic par dhyaan dene se isprakaar kii sambhavit ghatana ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 When a train spins round the basic physics, the wagon moves on a short curved path and the bulge of the wheel may fail to prevent an event that may lead to deformation
 railpath kii bhumiti bhi train ko sanbhaalane ke liye sankatpurna he
 It is desirable that instead of applying the brake below the steep grade it should be reheated and a fully charged brake pipe on top of a steep grade is desirable
 dharawahik brake vahaan hota he jahaan train akele hawa brake par ek grad neeche utarataa he
 The brake pipe application is gradually slowed down and the locomotive compressor recharges the brake pipe for recharge to stop the train if necessary
 in maamalon main locomotive brake ke upyog kii anumati hoti he train pakadaney ke liye twaran kii dar ko dhimaa or brake pipe ke punarbharan ke liye adhik samay dena taaki baad main train brake anuprayog or bhi behatar ho
 jab train bahut tej ho train pipe ke richarge se pehle brake anuprayog kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he 
 Where a train brake application is done, there is a lack of division and it gradually increases as the grade goes down
 yah serial brake se kuch bhinn he jisamen serial brake anuprayog ko jari kiya jaataa he, brake pipe ko richarge karne ke baad phir se laga diya jaataa he
 When the rate of useful acceleration slows down, the train allows the brake pipe to be recharged and applied
 
 When a train uses both dynamic brakes and air brakes processes it is called grade 'maintaining braking'
 ek baari grad ke saath gati seemaa ke saath) jab ek train kii maanya gati itani kam ho ki dynamik brake na ho jo ki isamen hona chahie
 Wagons are technically developed in freight train marshalling yards so that they can be easily rotated
 However, when a locomotive rotates several wagons simultaneously without a brake, the locomotive must brake for the entire train
 Loss of goods and rolling stock is possible
 iske alaava, bina brake ke wagon ke saath bahut tej hone kii sambhaavna rahati he
 In journalism, many styles are used to describe events in writing, which are called "journalistic styles"

 Like the Sanskrit commentators in the field of criticism, he analyzed the merits of the works and adopted the method of refutation
 dvivedi ji saral or subodh bhashaa likhane ke pakshpaati the
 He himself adopted the simple and popular language
 unki bhashaa main na to sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii adhikta he or na urdu-farsi ke aprachlit shabdon kii bharmaar he ve grih ke sthaan par ghar or ucch ke sthaan par unchaa likhnaa adhik pasand karte the

 She is pure refined and bound by the rules of grammar
 unka vaakya-vinyas hindi ko prakruti ke anuroop he kahin bhi vah angrezi yaa urdu ke dhang kaa nahin

 aise vishyon par lekh likhte samay dvivedi ji ne ek shikshak kii bhaanti ek baat ko kai baar duharaaya he taaki pathakon kii samaj main vah bhalee prakaar aa jaae
 Thus the style of the articles is the introductory style

 Writing in this style, he gave a mocking reply to the opponents
 yah style ospurn he
 It has fluency and its language is serious
 kahin-kahin yah style ospurn na hokar vyangyatmak ho jaati he
 At such places, there is fainting in words and simplicity in sentences

 Millions of rupees of Father Dad's earnings have filled your house
 padhe-likhe aap ram kaa naam hai
 You have been the chairman just because by showing your car to the government, you become brave and remain surrounded by eighty-four sixty-four people
 ' Dwivedi ji has adopted this style in discussing serious literary subjects
 is style ke bhi do rup milte hai
 The first form is found in those articles which have been written to convince the public about a controversial topic
 isamen vaakya chote-chote hai
 Language is simple
 doosraa rup un lekhon main paaya jaataa he jo vidwaanon ko sambodhit kar likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in it are relatively long
 bhashaa kuch clisht he
 for example - hindi sahitya kii seva karne waalon main dvivedi ji kaa vishesh sthaan he

 His father entrusted the education of zeb-ul-nisa to Hafiza Marim, one of the court ladies
 apane pita kii budhimatta or saahitiyik swaad kaa painaapan use viraasat main mila tha kyonki zeb-ul-nisa ne teen saal main quran ko yaad kiya or saat saal kii umr main hafiz ban gai thi

 sanvruth gear sabase pramukh gear ruparekhaon main se ek he
 In this type of gear, the teeth of the gear are on the outer side of a circle
 sanvruth gear ko samajhane ke liye hamen do vritton ke bare main sochna hoga, jo aapas main chhu nahin rahe hai
 Now we draw the tangent of both of them

 If one gear pushes the other gear, that push is always in the direction of this touch line
 asli gear main in vritton ke upar daant lage hote hai, jiske kaaran ve ek dusre ko chhu pate hai or saath main gum pate hai
 Now we have to understand some technical terms: swar vrutt : ham apane vritton ke kendron ko sidhi rekha se jod denge
 We will find a point where this line intersects the tangent
 is bindu ko swar bindu kehete hai
 We will draw a circle of radius up to the vowel point by placing the tip of the type at a center
 jab ham duusare centre ke saath aisa karenge, to hamen do swar vrutt praapt ho jaayenge
 With the help of this vocal circle we will estimate the angular speed of our gear
 chunki swar bindu par donon vritton kii gati samaan he Radius of b * angular speed of b = radius of a * angular speed of a kha kii koniya gati / k kii koniya gati=k kii trigya / kha kii trigya The angle formed between a line perpendicular to the tangent line and the line connecting the gear centers is called the pressure angle

 580px|thumb|territorial disputes in Europe The wikt: Antarctic Treaty System, formed on wikt: 1 December wikt: 1959 and entered into force on wikt: 23 June wikt: 1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of wikt: Antarctica and provides administration for the continent, which is carried out through consultative member meetings
 It freezes the territorial claims of all signatories for as long as the treaty is in force
 However, it is not a final settlement; parties can choose to withdraw from the System at any time
 Furthermore, only a minority of states have signed it, and it is not formally sanctioned by the wikt: United Nations
 Thus, Antarctica remains the only part of the planet any state can still lay claim to as wikt: terra nullius
 When the wikt:constitution of the Republic of China was adopted on wikt:25 December wikt:1947, the wikt:republic of China did recognize the statehood of the wikt:mongolian People's Republic with Soviet pressure
 After the wikt:un General Assembly Resolution 505 was passed in 1952, the Republic of China withdrew such a recognition in 1953 and therefore claimed wikt:greater Mongolia including wikt:outer Mongolia
 On wikt: 26 November wikt: 1993, the wikt: Judicial Yuan of the Republic of China in its Interpretation 328 called the constitutional territory beyond the reach of judicial review and thus avoided the question as whether Mongolia should be considered the constitutional territory of the Republic of China
 The Republic of China has once again recognized the statehood of wikt:mongolia in 2002, thus freezing the territorial claim, but as the Constitution of the Republic of China still mentions Mongolia in Article 119 that has not been superseded by the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China, there are different opinions as to whether such a recognition is constitutional
 Despite these, the Yearbook of the Republic of China 2003 Version published by the wikt:government Information Office does claim Outer Mongolia
 thumb | Map of the Republic of China with various territorial disputes Over 1
5% of the world's population live in an area disputed by two countries that are members of the wikt:united Nations
 This rises to around 25% when the areas and regions where territorial claims are made by two or more parties that do not recognize each other is included, although much of this comes from the wikt:republic of China's claim to wikt:mainland China

 GDP can be defined in three ways, all of which are conceptually similar
 pehla, yah ek nishchit samay avadhi main ek desh ke bheetar utpaadit sabhi antim maal or sevaao ke liye kiye gaye kul vyay ke baraabar he
 Second, it is equal to the sum of the total value added at each stage of production and subsidized tax on products by all industries within a country within a period
 teesraa, yah ek avadhi main desh main utpaadan ke dwaara utpann aay ke yoga ke baraabar he- arthath karmchaariyon kii kshatipurti kii raashi, utpaadan par kar aurasabsidi rahit aayaat or sakal parichaalan adhishesh The most common method of measuring and simply determining GDP is the expenditure or expenditure method: "sakal" kaa arth he sakal gharelu utpaada main se puunji share ke moolyahras ko ghataya nahin gaya he
 If the net investment is replaced by the gross investment in the above equation, the formula for net domestic product is obtained
 is sameekaran main upbhog or nivesh antim maal or sevaao par kiye jane vaale vyay hai
 The export-import part of the equation adjusts by subtracting the portion of expenditure not generated domestically and adding it back to the domestic sector
 arthshaastri saamaanya upbhog ke pad ko do bhaagon main baantna pasand karte hai; nijee upbhog or saarvajanik kshetra kaa kharch
 Theoretical macroeconomics has two advantages in dividing total consumption in this way: africa · uttar americadakshin america · asiaurope · oshinia Microeconomics · Macroeconomics: History of economic ideas

 Spending on new housing by a household is also included in the investment
 iske bolchaal ke arth ke vipareet, GDP main 'nivesh' kaa arth vittiya utpaadon ke kray se nahin he
 Purchases of financial products are classified as 'savings', not as investments
 vibhed spasht he: yadi dhan ko maal yaa sevaao main badla jaataa he, yah nivesh he ; lekin, yadi aap ek bond yaa stoke kaa ek share kharidte hai, yah hastantaran bhugtan GDP se alag kar diya jaataa he
 So stocks and bonds indirectly affect GDP
 haalaanki aise kray ko saamaanya bhashaa main nivesh hi kaha jaataa he, kul aarthik drushtikon se yah keval anubandhon kaa vinimay he or vaastavik utpaadan yaa GDP kaa hissaa nahin he
 It does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits
 C, I, g or NX ke udhaaharan : yadi aap apane hotel ke navinikaran ke liye dhan kharch karte hai, taaki adhibhog kii daron main vruddhi ho, to yah nijee nivesh he, lekin yadi aap aisa hi karne ke liye ek sangh main share kharidte hai ta yah bachat he
 The former is used when measuring GDP, not the latter
 lekin, jab sangh naveekaran par apane swayan ke kharch karata he, tab is kharch ko GDP main shaamil kiya jayega
 For example, if a hotel is a private home, then the renewal expense will be considered consumption, but if a government agency is converting the hotel into an office of civil services, the renewal expense will be considered a part of the public sector expenditure
 yadi navinikaran main videsh se ek jhumar kii kharid shaamil he, to vyay kii gananaa bhi aayaat kii vruddhi ke rup main kii jaati he, taaki NX kaa maan gir jaae or kul GDP kray ke dwaara prabhavit hota he
 If a domestic manufacturer is paid to build a chandelier for a foreign hotel, the situation will be reverse and the payment will be calculated in NX
 Again, GDP measures output through expenditure; If the chandelier generated was domestically purchased, it would have been included in the GDP figures when it was purchased by a consumer or business, but because it was exported to give the domestically generated amount It is necessary to "fix" the amount consumed domestically
 main
 Calculating real GDP growth helps economists determine whether production has decreased or increased, unaffected by changes in the purchasing power of the currency
