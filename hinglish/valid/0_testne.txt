 The principle of charge protection was discovered by Benjamin Franklin
 iske anusaar vidyut aavesh ko na to utpann kiya ja saktaa he or na hi use nasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the electric charge is always preserved in the universe
 abhyaas rup main, aavesh sangrakshan ek bhautik niyam he jiske anusaar ek nishchit aaytan main vidyut aavesh main kul antar, un aaytan main aagam aavesh or us aaytan se nirgat aavesh ke antar ke ekadam baraabar hota he
 According to mathematics, this principle can be written as a continuity equation: q vidyut aavesh kii maatra he, jo ek nishchit aaytan main t samay main hota he, QIN us aaytan main aane vaali aavesh kii maatra samay t1 evam t2 ke bich or QOUT us aaytan se baahar jane vaale aavesh kii usee samay main maatra he
 Vector differential can be used to represent this principle in terms of charge density ρ and electric current density J: This statement is equivalent to a conservation of four-current
 In the mid-nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell postulated the existence of electromagnetic waves as a result of his discovery that Ampère's law was inconsistent with the conservation of charge
 After correctly reformulating Ampère's law, Maxwell also realized that such waves would travel at the speed of light, and that light itself must be a form of electromagnetic radiation
 See electromagnetic wave equation for a full discussion of these discoveries

 In the mixture of Ishvani and man-vani, it was impossible to find out how much is the original Ishta Granth and what are its parts

 After these collections extensive literature has been prepared on the interpretation of these hadiths on a very large scale

 In this way a huge hadith-literature has been prepared

 inke prabhaav se akbar ko jeev hinsa ke prati aruchi hui or usne kai khaas tithiyon par apane samrajya main jeev hinsa kii manaahi kar di
 He himself became against meat eating
 usne swayan prayek shuukravaar shaakaahaari bhojan karne kaa vrath le liya
 Akbar realized that all religions have the same purpose
 atah usne sarvadharm samanvay arthath sab dharmon kii acchhee baaten lene kaa maarg pakadaa
 This is what he called 'reconciliation family'
 is tarah sab dharmon kii acchhee baton ko lekar usne deen-e-ilaahi chalaaya
 In this, the monotheism of Islam, according to Zoroastrianism, the sun and fire were revered as the light and glory of that god
 hindu or jain dharmon ke ahimsawad kii is dharm par gahari chhap thi
 It has been argued that din-i-ilahi's doctrine of having a new religion is a misconception, which was later born out of the mistranslation of Abul Fazl's works by British historians
 haalanki, yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki sulah-e-kul kii niti, jisamen deen-i-ilaihi kaa saar tha, akbar ne keval dharmik uddeshyon ke liye nahin balki saamaanya shahi prashasnic niti kaa ek bhaag ke rup main apanaaya tha
 This formed the basis of Akbar's policy of religious sympathy
 1605 main akbar kii maut ke samay unke muslim vishyon main asantosh kaa koi sanket nahin tha, or abdul haq jaise ek dharamshastri kii dharna thi ki nikat sambandh bane rahe
 As Emperor, Akbar considered it his duty to get under the religious elements
 ek baar vah fatehpur sikri main praatavkaal ekant main shila par baitha to uske man main yah bhaavana ai ki apni praja main bhedbhaav nahin rakhana chahie
 On the other hand, Mullahs of Islam used to advise persecution of non-muslims
 inke vaad-vivaad itane ugr hone lage ki badshaah ke saamne bhi ve darbari tahjeeb kaa dhyaan na rakhte
 Akbar's tendency to search for truth grew more in this mind
 akbar-namaa main abul fazal likhata he ki iske baad darbar main sabhi dharmon or sampradaayon ke vidwaan bhar gaye
 Everyone's religious beliefs would be considered
 yadi unamem koi kamajori hoti to use prakat kiya jaataa
 Religious tolerance was used, it would envy the wicked and the wicked
 akbar jab aantarik jhagadon se mukt hua to uskaa dharm-sudhaar kii ore dhyaan gaya
 He established a new religion
 isamen usne pavitra quran, brahmanon ke dharamshastra or isa messiah ke upadeshon kaa samanvay kiya
 For this he held a meeting
 isamen sabhi dharmon ke aacharyon ko bulaayaa, saath hi apane manasabadaaron ko bhi bulaayaa
 tha dhyaan dene kii baat he ki sabhi dharmon ke kattarpanthi anuyaayiyon ne akbar ke udaartaapurna drushtikon kaa virodh kiya
 On this, Akbar said- 'under any empire, it is unfair that the public be divided into many religions
 isse aapas main matbhed utpann hota he
 There are as many parties as many religions
 unamem aapas main shatruta hoti he atev sabhi dharmon main samanvay apekshit he
 But it should be done in such a way that despite being one, their specialty remains
 isse sabhi dharmon kii achchhaayiyaan bani rahengi or duusare dharmon kii visheshtaayen bhi aa jaayengi
 This will increase respect for God, peace in the people and security of the empire
 ' The European travelers have said that Akbar's eyes would keep on looking as if the sun was shimmering on the ocean
 uski aawaaj unchi thi, usamen ek anugoonj hoti thi
 If anyone had seen him, he would have known that this is the king
 jahangir kaa kathan he ki log usamen saakshaat ishwar kaa tej pate the
 He used to laugh and at that time his face would get a little deformed with laughter
 use krodh bahut hi kam aata
 He was very patient
 yorapia yatri hairaan the ki uske man kii baat chehre ke bhav se prakat hi na hoti, par krodh main uski akruti asay ho jaati thi
 His mustache hair would grow
 sanyogvash akbar shikaar khilne mathura gaya tha
 There he came to know that Hindus have to pay taxes on coming to Mathura
 usne yatri kar uthaa diya
 Akbar said - Where is the justice to be done on the worship of God! The following year, on the ninth anniversary of his coronation, he also lifted the tax-jizya imposed on non-muslims according to Muslim law
 yah ek anokhi ghatana thi
 Then there was no Jaziya tax for both generations - Aurangzeb imposed Jaziya tax after the death of Jaswant Singh in 1679
 jajia se prativarsh samrajya ko lakhon kii aay hoti
 Still Akbar considered it unfair

 • In 2005, Muhammad Yunus Ansari, a resident of Kashipur Orissa, appealed to the President that his four children are suffering from incurable disease

 Therefore, Sections 306 and 309 are constitutional and valid
 yuthenesia ke paksh main tark Euthanasia is a popular topic in the world today

 From these wars of Napoleon and the actions of ending small states into larger units, a national movement arose in Italy which is famous in history as the Resorgomento
 italian abhiyaan se lautne par napolian kaa bhavy swaagat hua
 The directory also became fearful and started thinking of ways to keep Napoleon away from France
 is samay france kaa pratidwandvi keval britain rah gaya tha
 In order to defeat Britain, Napoleon thought it appropriate not to vilify his empire and laid his Egypt-expedition plan
 directory ne use turant sweekaar kar liya
 In 1798, Bonaparte left for Egypt
 britain par pratyaksh akraman karne ke sthaan par britain ke purvi samrajya ko mistra ke madhyam se samaapt karne kii yojana french shaskaon ko sangat prathit hui
 It was encountered by Mamluk Turkey in the so-called Paramid War
 kintu british nausena kaa bumadhyasagariya adhyaksh commander nelson napolian kaa peechha kushaltapurvak kar rahaa tha
 He proceeded to disperse the French in the Battle of the Nile and forced the turkeys to enter the battle on the side of England as well
 nelson kii is safalataa ne britain ko ek dwitiya gut banane kaa avasar diya or europe ke ve raashtra, jinhen napolian dabaa chukaa tha, france ke viruddh abhiyaan kii taiyaari karne lage
 Napoleon waged a Syrian expedition when Turkey entered the war
 keval teraa hajaar kii ek simit tukdi ke saath ekar kii ore badha kintu sidney smith jaise kushal senaanee dwaara roak diya gaya
 This proved to be a boon for Napoleon
 ab napolian syria main ek duusare french samrajya kii rachana main lag gaya
 But France was going through a critical situation at this time
 at: napolian ne misr main apni satta sthapit karne main safaleebhoot hote hue bhi france main prakat ho janaa vaanchhneeya samajha
 There was a stir as Napoleon entered France
 anukool vaataavaran paakar november, 1799 main napolian ne satta hathiyaa kar diarectory kaa vighatan kiya or nayaa vidhaan banaaya
 According to this legislation, three councils were appointed
 kuch samay pashchaat sari shaktiyaan pratham kaunsal napolian main kedrit ho gai
 France was tired of a long unrest and intermittent peace was absolutely necessary to lead the revolution to its founding
 kintu shanti sthapana ke purv austria ko natmastak kar dene ke liye ek italian abhiyaan aavashyak tha
 Napoleon began his second expedition to Italy in the spring of 1800 and after conquering Merengo forced Austria to the Treaty of Luneville, repeating all the conditions of the earlier campoforms
 ab dwitiya gut tut gaya or nepolian ne england se aamiain kii sandhi 1801 i main kii, jiske antargat donon rashtron ne ek duusare ke vijit pradesh waapas kiye
 Now Napoleon implemented a reform plan and gave France governance and order
 france kii aarthik sthiti main anushaasan diya
 Made unprecedented changes in education system
 bhoomikar vyavastha sudrudh kii
 Beautified Paris
 sena main yathesht parivartan kiye tathaa france kii vyavastha ko ek vaigyanik aadhaar diya, jo ab bhi nepolian code ke naam se vikhyath he
 He received the support of the Catholic world by performing a con-cordet from the Pope
 in sudhaaron se napolian ko yathesht safalataa praapt hui or march 1804 i main vah france kaa samrat ban gaya
 The incident caused a stir in all of Europe
 france or britain ke bich phir yuddh ke badal mandaraane lage
 Napoleon sent his army to Bolon on the northern seaboard to invade England
 england ne iske uttar main apane english channel sthit nausena kii tukdi ko jaagruk kiya or phir har bhidnt main napolian ko chakit karata gaya
 At the end of the Treaty of Amiens, William Pitt came under the rule and formed a third group consisting of the nations of England, Austria, Yes, etc
 napolian ne phir austria ke viruddh morchabandi kii or sisalpine ganatantr ko samaapt kar swayan italy ke raja kaa pad grahan kiya
 Defeated Austria in the Battle of Ulm
 austria kaa shaasha francis bhaag gaya or jaar kii sharan lee
 Here, in the Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson defeated Napoleon's army, allowing Austria to again challenge Napoleon
 lekin asterlitz ke yuddh main haar jane par austria ko pressvarg kii lajjapurna sandhi sweekaar kerani padi
 This success increased the euphoria of Napoleon and now he began to trample Germany
 jena or arasted ke yudhon main 14 oktober 1806 i main haraakar rin sandhi kii rachana kar apane bhai joseph bonaport ke shashan ko majboot kiya
 Now only Russia remained, which Napoleon defeated in the Battle of Freedland in June 1807, and was forced into the Treaty of Tilsit of July 1807
 saare europe kaa swami ho jane par ab nepolian ne england ko haraane ke liye ek aarthik yuddh chhedaa 
 The trade of all the nations of Europe ceased from England and enforced a strict control over the whole border of Europe
 britain ne iske uttar main europe ke rashtron kaa france ke vyapaar roak dene kii ek nishedhaatmak ajna prachaarit kii
 Britain increased its compensation by increasing trade, but the economic condition of European nations began to deteriorate and they suffered from this torture of France
 sabase pehle spain ne is vyavastha ke viruddh vidroh kiya
 As a result, Napoleon invaded Spain and seized power there
 is par spain main ek rashtriya vidroh chhid gaya
 Napoleon could not suppress it, he had to suppress the rebellion of Austria, and then Prussa and Russia also disobeyed this system
 rus kaa vidroh nepolian ke liye vinaashkari siddh hua
 The ruin of his Moscow campaign has become famous in history
 paris lautakar nepolian ne pun: ek sena ekatra kii kintu lipatsig main use phir prasha, rus or austria kii sanmilit senaaon ne haraaya
 Due to the national struggle erupting all around, he could not actively suppress any nation and in 1814 AD was sent to the island of Elba
 mitra rashtron kii senaayen waapas bhi nahin ho paayin thim ki soochna mili ki nepolian kaa shatdivasiy shashan shuru hua
 The Allies therefore defeated him in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and imprisoned St
 Helena
 vahaan 1821 i main paanch may ko uski mrityu hui
 Napoleon Bonaparte took reforms in various areas in 1799 to consolidate his position in power and provide administrative stability to France
 vastutah diarectory ke shashan ko samaapt kar nepalian ne satta kii thi or france kii janata ne us parivartan ko sweekaar kiya tha to iskaa kaaran tha vah araajaktaa or avyavashtha se ub chuki thi
 Therefore, it was necessary for Napoleon to establish a well-organized governance and law and order in the interior
 pratham counsal banane ke baad nepolian ne france ke liye ek naveen samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya jo kranti yug kaa chauthaa samvidhan tha
 Through this, executive power was vested in three counselors
 pradhan counsal ko anya counsalaron se adhik shakti praapt thi
 In fact, the Republic certainly showed in the Constitution, but the entire power of the state was concentrated in the hands of Nepalis
 nepolian ne shashan vyavastha kaa kenndrikaran kiya or departments tathaa district kii sthaneey sarkaron ko samaapt kar prefect evam sab-prefects kii niyukti kii
 Their appointment and the appointment of all the mayors of villages and cities were directly done by the central government
 is prakaar prashasan ke kshetra nepolian ne in adhikariyon par paryaapt niyantran rakh prashasan ko chust-durust banaae rakhaa saath hi yogyata ke aadhaar par inaki niyukti kii
 Napoleon's reforms in administrative areas were in a way anti-revolution because the National Assembly had completely decentralized the administrative structure during the revolution and elected representatives were given the responsibility to govern the country, but the Nepalese gave this arrangement Reversed and reestablished pre-revolution system
 us drushti se vah kranti kaa hantaa tha
 Napoleon tried to revive France from its dismal economic situation
 is kram main usne sarvapratham kar pranali ko sucharu banaaya
 The task of collecting tax was done by the central employees and the recovery started strictly
 usne ghoosekhori, sattebaaji, thekedaari main anuchit munaafe par roak laga di
 He emphasized austerity and imposed many indirect taxes on the French people
 nepolian ne france main vittiya gatividhiyon ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye bank of france kii sthapana kii jo aaj bhi kaayam he
 It also set up a separate fund to repay the national debt
 nepolian ne jahaan tak sambhav hua sena ke kharch kaa boj vijit pradeshon par daalaa or france kii janata ko is boj se mukt rakhane kii koshish kii
 Napoleon also stressed the improvement of agriculture and planned to make the barren and sandy areas fertile
 vyapaar ke vikaas ke liye nepolian ne avaagaman ke sadhano kii taraf paryaapt dhyaan diya
 Arranged for mechanical education for the progress of various types of businesses, roads, canals built
 francisi audyogic vastuon ko lokapriy banane ke liye pradarshnee ke aayojan ko badhaava diya or swadeshi vastuon evam udyogon ko protsaahan diya
 Encouraged construction work to overcome the problem of unemployment
 is tarah nepolian ne france ko jarjar or diwaaliyepan kii sthit se ubaara
 But even in terms of economic reforms, Napoleon's actions appear to be anti-revolution
 krantikaal main pratyaksh karo par bal diya gaya tha jabaki nepolian ne apratyaksh karon par bal dekar puraatan vyavastha ko sthapit karne kii koshish kii
 In the same way, Napoleon displayed an anti-revolutionary mindset by prioritizing the commercialist philosophy
 uskaa maananaa tha ki rajya ko kosh kii suraksha evam vyapaar main santulan laane ke liye sakriy hastkshep karnaa hoga jabaki kranti kaa bal to mukt vyapaar par tha
 The Nepalese wanted citizens who had faith in him and his system
 iske liye usne shiksha ke rashtriya evam dharmanirpeksh swaroop apanaate hue sudhaar kiye
 Organized education at primary, secondary and higher levels
 sarkaar ke dwaara niyukt shikshakon kii sahaayta se chalane vaale in skulon main ek hi paathyakram, ek hi pathyapustaken ek hi vardi rakhi jaati thi
 Napoleon established a university in Paris and taught subjects in Latin, French, science, mathematics, etc
 yah uniwarsity vishvavidhyalay ke saamaanya arth main koi uniwarsity nahin thi varan praathmik se ucchtar shiksha tak kii sabhi sansthaaon ko ekasutra main baandhne vaali ek vyavastha kii
 Its aim was to keep maximum government control over education and to make students loyal to the government
 nepolian ne shodh kaaryon ke liye insticute of france kii sthapana kii
 Napoleon showed no interest in women's education
 unki shiksha kaa bhaar dharmik sansthaaon par chhod diya gaya
 The majority of France's population was under the influence of the Catholic Church
 kranti ke dauraan carch kii shakti ko kamjor kar use rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya
 Church property was nationalized and clergy were asked to take an oath of loyalty to the state
 isse pope naaraaz hua or aam janata ko virodh karne ke liye uksaaya
 As a result, there was tension between the government and the public
 nepolian ne ise dur karne ke liye 1801 se pope ke saath samjhauta kiya jise konkardet kaha jaataa he
 He had the following provisions
 nepolian kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn or sthaayee kaary tha- vidhi samhita kaa nirmaan
 In fact, before the revolution, the law and order of France was different and there were so many types of laws that even those who followed the law did not know them and this chaos increased even during the revolution
 nepolian ne is avyavashtha ko dur kiya
 Napoleon himself considered his Code of Law more powerful than his 40 wars
 is code ke dwaara nepolian ne france main sarvlokik kanoon paddati kii sthapana kii
 Under the Civil Code, he strengthened the authority of the head of the family
 striyaan purushon ke adheen rakhi gai or pati kaa kaary patni kii raksha karnaa he
 The divorce method was made difficult
 civil vivaah kii vyavastha bhi is samhita main kii gai
 Thus, by recognizing the practice of civil marriage and divorce, Napoleon practiced in Europe that the work of society could go on without the cooperation of the priests
 is prakaar anya samhitaayein jaise vyapaar sambandhi kanoon samhita, Code of Criminal Proc
 aadi banaae gaye
 The interests of the laborers were ignored in its trading code and the ban on their unions continued
 is drushti se nepolian ne kranti ke aadarshon ke viruddh kaary kiya
 Despite this, the importance of this law code was to provide uniformity of law throughout the country and to simplify the judicial system practically
 jahaan-jahaan nepolian kii senaayen gai yah samhita lagu kii gai or nepolian ke paraajay ke baad bhi barkaraar rahi
 It is a permanent fame of Napoleon
 nepolian ke vidhi samhita main burjua varg ke hiton par zyada jor diya gaya he
 The officer related to land was further strengthened and the protection of personal property was further strengthened and a number of laws were enacted to protect personal property
 tered union bananaa aparaadh ghoshit kiya gaya
 In case of litigation, the owners were asked to accept the claims of the owners in lieu of the arguments of the workers
 naagarik samhita kaa aadhaar saamaajik samta bhi he
 Privilege and feudal rule had no place in the Code
 bade putr ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikari maanane kaa kanoon bhi nahin tha sampatti par sabhi putron ko barabari kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Napoleon established a new elite in society
 usne aay ke hisaab se oopaadhiyon kaa kram nirdhaarit kiya
 This work of Napoleon was contrary to the ideals of revolution
 europe raajnneetik kshitij par nepolian kaa pradurbhaav ek ghumaketu kii tarah hua or apni prakriya tathaa parishram ke bal par vah sheeghra hi europe kaa bhaagyavidhaataa ban baitha
 In it, everyone was amazed by his amazing military and administrative abilities
 parantu uski shakti kaa stambh jaise baalu kii bhit par khadaa tha
 What collapsed within a few years was virtually the rise and fall of Napoleon like a dazzling meteor
 vah europe ke akaash main sainik safalataa ke bal par chamakta rahaa parantu paraajay ke saath hi uske bhagya kaa sitara dub gaya
 The empire, which was established after hard work, came to an end on seeing that there were many reasons for its downfall, which are the same
 aseem mahatvakanksha- Napoleon was infinitely ambitious
 aseem mahatvakankshi kisi vyakti ke patan kaa mukhya kaaran sabit hoti he
 The same thing happened with Napoleon
 yuddh main jaise- jaise- uski vijay hoti gai vaise- vaise uski mahatvakanksha badhaata gaya or vah vishwa rajya kii sthapana kaa swapan dekhne laga
 He would not have to see the plight of the downfall if he was satisfied with a little and took care of the conquered empire and spent his time in it
 charitrik durbalata- Napoleon was full of courage, restraint and patience, but in his eyes, hatred was his vengeance and his stigma of forgiveness
 uske charitra kii badi durbalata yah thi ki vah sandhi ko sammanit samjhauta nahin maanata tha
 Friendship of any country was no more than a political necessity for him
 dhire- dhire vah ziddee banataa gaya use yah vishwaas tha ki uskaa prayek kadam thik he
 He could never forget, he began to ignore the advice of others
 falat: uske sachche mitra bhi usase dur hote chale gaye
 Napoleon's system was based on militarism- uski raajnneetik pranali sanyavad par aadhaarit thi jo iske patan kaa pradhan kaaran sabit hua
 He depended on the army in all matters, as a result he was always involved in war
 vah yah bhul gaya ki sainikwaad sirf sankat ke samay hi laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 As long as France was clouded by plagues, the people there supported him
 As soon as the plagues were removed, the people stopped supporting him
 francisi janata kii sahanubhuti or prem kaa khona uske liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Apart from this, the defeated nations became his enemies, who rose up against him as soon as the opportunity arose
 itihaaskaar kabbon ne thik hi likhaa he
 'napoleon's empire flourished in war The war was the basis of his existence and it ended in war itself
 ’ Defective military system prarambh main france kii sena desh prem kii bhaavana se otprot thi
 He used to fight for an ideal and to serve a purpose
 parantu jyon- jyon uske samrajya kaa vistaar hua sena kaa rashtriya rup vidhitat hota gaya
 At first, French troops were included in his army but later German German Purtagali and Dutch soldiers were added to it
 falat: uski sena anek rajyon kii sena ban gai
 There was no ideal and purpose before him
 at: uski sainik shakti kamjor padati gai or yah uske patan kaa mahatvapurn kaaran sabit hua
 Weakness of the Navy nepolian ne sthal sena kaa sanghathan thik se kiya tha kintu uske paas shaktishali nausena kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran use england se parajeet hona padaa
 If he had a powerful navy he would not have to be defeated by England
 vijit pradeshon main deshbhakti kaa abhaav- The territories he conquered were not in the hearts of the people, but he had goodwill and love for them
 ve nepolian kii shashan se ghrinaa karte the
 When his power began to weaken, his subordinate states began to strive for their independence
 europea raashtra ne uske khilaaf sangh ke liye chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or isi ke chalate waterlu ke yuddh main use parajeet hona padaa
 Enmity with the pope mahadwipiya vyavastha ke kaaran usne pope ko apana shatru bana liya
 When the Pope refused to accept the same continental system, he took over Rome in April 1808
 or 1809 i
 main pope ko bandi bana liya falat: catholicon ko yah vishwaas ho gaya ki nepolian ne keval rajyon kii swatantraaa nasht karne vaala daanav he
 Otherwise, they also destroy their religion
 audyogic kranti- It is said that he was defeated not in the grounds of Waterloo but in the factories of Manchester and the iron cladding of Barkingdhan
 audyogic kranti ke falswarup england main bade -2 kaarkaane khole gaye or dekhte hi dekhte england samrudh ban gaya
 As a result, he was able to meet his army's modern assassin, which proved fatal to Napoleon
 mahadwipiya vyavastha- The continental system was quite forgotten
 vah england ko sabase bada shatru maanata tha
 England's mainstay of power was naval and worldwide trade and Napoleon could not destroy his naval power, so his trade was tried to strike
 isi uddeshy se usne mahadwipiya vyavastha ko janm diya usne aadesh jari kiya ki koi desh england ke saath vyapaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And neither can use England made
 yah nepolian kii bhayankar bhul thi
 This arrangement trapped him in a trap that was difficult to get out of
 isliye mahadwipiya vyavastha iske patan kaa mukhya kaaran mana jaataa he
 War with the Portuguese purtegal kaa england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh tha kintu nepolian ke dawaab ke kaaran use england se sambandh todna padaa
 This caused considerable damage to Purtigal
 isliye usne phir se england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh kaayam kiya
 Napoleon was enraged and attacked Purtagal
 yah bhi nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Conflict with Spain nepolian kii teesri bhul spain ke aantarik maamle main hastkshep tha
 Millions of its soldiers were killed
 falat: is yuddh main uski sthiti bilkul kamjor ho gai
 Which encouraged his opponents, when Napoleon made his brother king of Spain, the inhabitants there were not ready to consider that foreigner as king
 unhone nepolian kii sena ko spain se bhaga diya
 Other countries were also encouraged by that rebellion and they also started revolting, which made its fall inevitable
 rus kaa abhiyaan- Napoleon heavily invaded Russia and Russia did not accept its continental system
 isapar nepolian ne rus par akraman kar diya
 In this, however, Moscow was captured but it had to suffer great damage
 uske virodhiyon ne akraman karne kii yojana banaai
 He had to be defeated in this attack
 thakaan- He was tired of being constantly busy in many wars
 50 tourists have written that all the reason for the fall of Napoleon lies in the same word fatigue
 jyon- jyon vah yudadh main ulajhata gaya tyon- 2 uski shakti kamjor padati gai vah thak gaya or uske chalate bhi uskaa patan jaruri ho gaya
 Relative uske patan ke liye uske sage sambadhi bhi kam uttaradaayi nahin the
 However, he used to behave generously towards his relatives
 lekin jab bhi vah sankat main padataa tha to uske sambandhi uski madad nahin karte the
 Organization of quartz nepolian kii kamajori se laabh uthaakar uske shatruon ne chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or mitra rashtron ne use parajeet kiya
 He was captured and sent to Salbai and was made independent ruler there but Napoleon could not stay there for a long time
 He soon returned to France and became the ruler there
 lekin isbaar vah sirf sau dinon tak ke liye samraat rahe
 The Allies were finally defeated in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 AD
 vah pakad liya gaya mitra rashtron ne use kaidi ke rup main saint helena naamak tapu par bhej diya jahaan 52 varshon kii aayu main 1821 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Thus, all the above reasons were directly and indirectly responsible for his downfall
 He built his empire through war and it also fell due to the wars
 arthath jin tatwon ne nepolian ke samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha unheen tatwon ne uskaa vinaash bhi kar diya

 Family Thakur Uday Pratap Singh He was proud of his father

 durbhaagya se, thakur parivaar apratyaashit paristhitiyon kaa saamana kar rahe hai or jagmohan prasad dwaara swarna bhawan chhodane ke liye majaboor he
 The rivalry between Uday Pratap and Jagmohan is a tragedy that took place ever since Uday Pratap and Jagmohan were children
 kai saal pehle, vahaan swarna bhawan, jagmohan pita, jo udai pratap pita ke chaalak apni patni or bete jagmohan ke saath maujuud tha kiya gaya tha main ek puja tha
 There is a beautiful temple in Swarna Bhawan which contains gold idols for the deities

 Now, Jagmohan comes to take revenge on Thakur
 thakur parivaar chandra prabhaa bhai raghav pandit, jo ek baar thakur kaa dewan tha ke saath rahane chalaa jaataa he
 Raghav is a good and kind man, while his wife Sheetal is very greedy and clever, he is constantly insulting the Thakur family and tries his best to drive them out of his house
 As Abha Kama decides to employ Jagmohan at Swarna Bhavan, Abha tells him that her name is so much that Jagmohan cannot recognize her
 jagmohan ke sabase kam umr ke bete karan prasad abha ke saath pyaar main gir jaataa he
 Aura also begins to fall in love with her, but due to rivalry between their families
 vimal kii vajah se jaldi hi, abha bhai prakaash or pakadaa jaataa he abha kii asli pahchaan kaa pataa chalaa he
 Karan is forced to marry Swarna Aura to save her life from being ruined by her father, who had planned on marrying an alcoholic Aura
 abha or jagmohan or uske pati ke rup main shaadi karan ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya
 Soon Karan Abha succeeds in confessing her love for him
 karan ke bachapan ke dost, sania maathur, swarna bhawan or uske saath pyaar main gir jaataa he par aata he
 At the same time, even Aura's childhood friend Sanskar realizes his love for Aura
 abha vivaah sanskaar ke saath tay ho jaataa he, lekin shaadi ke din par, karan ek durghatana he or abha use jaati he, har kisi ko apane pyaar or shaadi kaa khulaasa
 haalanki yah uske dard, abha uske mata pita use pyaar, karan ke liye dekhbhaal karne ke liye chhod detaa he
 Jagmohan is not like their marriage and gives aura some strict rules and forces them into the storage room
 Aura's love and care soon to win over the family's heart
 baad main abha or karan apane honeymoon ke liye janaa he, lekin ve mumbai ke liye ek twarit band karne ke liye apane doston sania or sanskaar se milane
 sanskaar abha ke saath pyaar main abhi bhi paaglon kii tarah he or use chahta he, karan ko maarane ke liye tay he, vah kai baar vifal rahata he
 Aura rites soon and finds her worried about the passion
 to sanskaar, karan talaak abha or use ek kaam he ki sanskaar kiya karne ke aarope lagaate hai ki vajah se galatfahami kii vajah se
 vah to pataa chalata he ki yah sanskaar or kshamaa ke liye abha karne ke liye aagrah kiya gaya tha or uske punarvivaah
 sanskaar abha or karan ke bich galatfahami paidaa kar di he, uske khilaaf safaltaapurvak karan mode
 abha waapas uski bahan lata or uski maan kii madad se har kisi kaa vishwaas hasil karne kii koshish karata he
 Karan arrogant and rude sister Kanika tries to elope with her lover the so-called Nikhil and who later finds out Jagmohan and she is very angry and Kanika is well humiliated by her family
 style, vimal kii patni or karan bhabhi, ek buraai, mahila kii sajeesh rachane ki manaa kanika is dardanaak prakaran ke liye abha se nafrat he
 That aura soft-spoken brother Prakash ends the marriage and the tensions between them rise high
 sanskaar sajeesh ke ant main vifal rahata he ke rup main vah pakadaa or abha maaf karan
 sanskaar acha ho jaataa he, lekin ek nai samasya paidaa hoti he
 It starts with clues from Karan's past when Karan was young, his maternal uncle turns out to have his mother forced to fight a false trial to get her husband Jagmohan Pratibha
 uske inkaar ke baad, vah karan ko maarane kaa prayaas kiya, lekin durghatana ke dwaara apane hi bete, banty, ko maar daalaa
 So he comes back and Pratibha tries to get revenge with the other sister Yashodhara
 vah pakadaa he or dandit lekin yashodhara dur nikal jaataa he
 He attempts to kill Karan
 abha uske judawaan siddharth, ek abhinayta or patakatha lekhak jiskaa vaastavik naam he ranchod se miltaa he
 It is learned that several years ago, Jagmohan won a case in "777", in which he later discovered that he was fighting for the wrong person
 unke maamle kii vajah se, nirdosh vyakti ko jise vah galat sabit kar diya apane bete ko kho diya
 a couple weeks later when Pratibha gave birth to Karan, she also gave birth to her twin Ranchod, but knew that there is no one except Jagmohan and a nanny
 vah nirdosh shri tiwari ranchod saunp diya or use naam diya he
 So later on Karan gets into a serious car accident and is missing, leaving Aura sad and regretful
 Ranchod agrees to help Aura for 11 days, masquerading as Karan so the family is not worried
 11 dinon ke baad puraa kar rahe hai, abha or ranchod mumbai lautne
 vahaan, abha karan ek aakhri baar ke liye khoj karne ke liye chalaa jaataa he or ranchod apane raste par chalaa jaataa he
 While Abha is searching for Karan, Ranchod gets into a vicious fight with drunken Dushyant, who is Yashodhara's only son
 to panchod aspataal main karan miltaa he, uski buree haalat dekhakar or sochaa ki karan ke bare main marane tha use vaada kiya he ki vah abha or yashodhara se parivaar ke baaki hisson kii raksha karegaa
 The Prasad family hopes to bring Karan and Abha Ranchod home, with the family planning a grand birthday party for both sons
 abha parivaar ke bare main karan, jab ranchod dukhad khabar bataao, prathit hota he karan ke rup main prastut sahamat pravesh karti he, ke bare main he
 Abha finds out that she is pregnant with Karan's child

 Blood pressure is the pressure exerted on the vessel walls by the blood flowing into the blood vessels
 dhamniyaan vah nalika he jo pump karne vaale hriday se rakt ko sharir ke sabhi utakon or indriyon tak le jate hai
 The heart regulates blood flow in the arteries by pumping blood into the arteries and the pressure applied on it is called blood pressure
 kisi vyakti kaa raktchaap, systolic / dyastolic raktchaap ke rup main abhivyakt kiya jaataa he
 For example 120 / 80 systolic means the number above represents the pressure in the arteries
 isamen hriday kii mansapeshiyaan sankuchit hokar dhamniyon main rakt ko pump karti hai
 Dyelastic blood pressure, ie the lower number, represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle relaxes after contraction
 raktchaap hameshaa us samay adhik hota he jab hriday pump kar rahaa hota he banisbat jab vah shithil hota he
 The systolic blood pressure of a healthy adult person is between 90 and 120 millimeters of mercury

 Normal blood pressure should be 120 / 80 as per current guidelines
 raktchaap ko maapne vaale yantra ko raktchapamapi yaa sphignomanometer kehete hai
 Some important stages in the history of development of blood pressure detection and measurement are as follows: nimna raktchaap vah daab he jisase dhamniyon or nason main rakt kaa pravaah kam hone ke lakshan yaa sanket dikhaai dete hai
 When the blood flow is very low, oxygen and nutritious substances cannot reach the vital senses like brain, heart and kidneys, due to which these senses do not work normally and this can cause it to be permanently damaged
 ucch raktchaap ke vipareet, nimna raktchaap kii pahchaan multah lakshan or sanket se hoti he, na ki vishisht daab sankhya ke
 Some people have a blood pressure of 90 / 50 but they do not show any symptoms of low blood pressure and hence they do not have low blood pressure, however in those people whose blood pressure is high and their blood pressure falls to 100 / 60 Symptoms of low blood pressure begin to appear
 yadi kisi ko nimna raktchaap ke kaaran chakkar aata ho yaa mitli aati ho yaa khadey hone par behosh hokar gir padataa ho to use orthostetic ucch raktchaap kehete hai
 The normal person is able to control the effect caused by low pressure on standing
 lekin jab paryaapt raktchaap ke kaaran chakree dhamni main rakt kii aapurti nahin hoti he to vyakti ko seene main dard ho saktaa he yaa dil kaa daura pad saktaa he
 When there is insufficient blood supply in the kidneys, the kidneys cannot remove wastes like urea and creatine from the body, due to which their quantity in the blood is increased
 coronary arteri yani vah dhamni jo hriday ke maance peshiyon ko rakt kii aapurti karti he
 This is a condition that can be life threatening
 nimna raktchaap kii sthiti main gurde, hriday, fefde tathaa mastishk teji se kharaab hone lagate hai
 Blood pressure above 130 / 80 is called hypertension or hypertension
 iskaa arth he ki dhamniyon main ucch chaap he
 High blood pressure does not mean excessive emotional stress
 bhaavnaatmak tanaav va dabaav asthaayee taur par rakt ke daab ko badha dete hai
 Blood pressure should generally be lower than 120 / 80 and blood pressure between 120 / 80 and 139 / 89 is called pre hypertension and a blood pressure of 140 / 90 or more is considered high

 If you feel dizzy, have headaches, trouble breathing, lack of sleep, remain pensive, breathe less hard and have nose bleed, then check with a doctor, it may be due to high blood pressure

 According to Canadian researcher Ross D
 Feldman, high blood pressure patients need special care and examination, which can reduce the risk of heart attack by one-fourth, while also reducing the chance of stroke by 40 percent
 je en si, saat-2003 ke anusaar raktchaap kaa nimna vargeekaran, 18 varsh se adhik vayaskon hetu bataaya jaataa he
 This is an average based on correctly taken blood pressure readings of people sitting in the office
 chikitsak ke paas jaanch hetu pahunchane ke baad kam-se-kam paanch minute ke liye aaraam karne ke baad hi apana raktadab dikhaaen
 After walking for a long time, the blood pressure is increased after climbing the stairs, checking immediately after running and running
 yah dhyaan rakhana chaiye ki jaanch ke samay kursi par aaraam se baithen hon va pair jameen par rakhen hon, tathaa baanh or raktadab maapak-yantra hriday jitani oonchai par hona chahie
 Tea, coffee, cola drinks and smoking should not be drunk half an hour before the test
 inke seven se raktadab agle 15 se 20 minute ke liye bad jaataa he
 The width of the cuff to be tied on the arm of the blood pressure gauge should be according to the thickness of the arm
 kaph itnaa chaudaa ho ki baanh kaa lagbhag teen-chauthai gheraa usamen aa jaae
 If the arm is thick, blood pressure readings will be increased when blood pressure is taken from normal phlegm
 yadi baanh patali or kaph bada he to thik ulat hoga, raktadab kam napega
 Always use a test instrument to measure blood pressure
 kai baar raktchaap do jagah napa jaaen to antar miltaa he, yahaan tak ki nurse dwaara napa gaya to kam aata he or doctor dwaara napa gaya adhik
 Many times when blood pressure is measured in the office, it comes more and less at home, it is called white coat hypertension
 is tarah ke bade raktchaap kaa upachaar karne kii atyaavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 If the width of the cuff in the arm of the blood pressure measuring instrument is small, it is inflated slowly or very rapidly, then the blood pressure will be higher
 baanh main baandhi gayi pattee ko haday ke str par na rakhaa jaae to raktchaap galat aayegaa
 There may be many other reasons like this, if special care is not taken, blood pressure will come wrong
 marakari ke jo maapak-yantra hai ve electranik yantron se zyada sahi reeding dete hai
 Due to all these factors, it is necessary that once the blood pressure rises, the medicine should not be started immediately
 kam se kam teen baar kuch dinon ke antaraal par raktchaap napa jaae
 Treatment should be started only if the average of several readings has increased
 yadi rogi baari chintaa main hon to thodi der ke liye raktchaap bad jayega
 Blood pressure will be increased even after adequate exercise
 yah ek saamaanya prakriya he or iskaa upachaar nahin kiya jaataa
 Where there is a dilemma, the new technology ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is done to assess the exact situation
 kabhi raktchaap thodaa badha ho, jaise to turant dawa leni nahin chaiye
 Before this, we should try to change our lifestyle for some time

 For this, the amount of sodium in food should be reduced first, people usually eat 10 grams of salt in a day
