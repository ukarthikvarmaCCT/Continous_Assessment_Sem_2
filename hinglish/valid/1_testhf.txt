 ummid he ki 2010 main kisi bhi vaqt ek record ko release kiya ja saktaa he
 This is to be expected
 humlog kabhi kisi ko majaboor nahin kar sakate
 mujhe nishchit rup se andeh he ki humlog is garmiyon main ekasaath daure par jaaenge or humlog bahut jald apana kaarykram pradarshan shuru karenge or hamaari sangeet rachana sabko madahosh kar degi or humlog ek baar phir se vahi aag lagane vaale hai

 serial ata hard drive ko computer se jodne kaa ek tarika hota he
 It is a replacement for PETA
 sata ke aane se pehle pata ko ata yaa idii hi kehete the
 The most important feature of SATA that distinguishes it from PATA is its cable
 sata hard drive ko computer se jodne ke liye patale cabel kaa upyog karata he
 PATA is still used more than SATA, but now SATA is found in new computers
 2005 ke baad ke computaron main sata interfes lag kar aa rahaa he
 In PATA, 'P' means parallel and can be seen in computers as multiple wires that run parallel to the same direction in the ribbon cable and connect to the hard drive
 sata or pata main bahut si bhinnataayen hoti hai
 Theoretically SATA is faster than PATA
 yadhyapi jin atitivr gatiyon ke bare main companiyaan daawey karatin he, unki aavashyaktaa praayah kam hi padati he
 Other benefits include simple maintenance of the new cable
 kuch drive ko computer ke chalate rahete hue hi computer se joda yaa alag kiya ja saktaa he, yani computer ko shat-down karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 This is called hot swapping
 antat, kuch driven "netive cmand kuing" samarthit hai
 This means that the drive can rearrange the order of a task so that the task is done at a faster speed
 in donon ke alag jod or bhinn madraboard prakaar bhi hote hai
 The old PATA motherboard cannot carry SATA drives, nor is it reversible
 haa aise madraboard milte hai, jo pata va sata donon prakaar kii harddisk ko saport karte hai
 The specially designed P7P55D Premium is the first of its kind motherboard that provides data transfer at a speed of 6 gigabides per second with SATA interface

 vanamaanush yaa chimpanzi priamet gana kaa prasiddh stanposhi jeev he, jo africa ke ghaney jangalon main, gini se lekar congou tathaa pashchimi yuganda tak ke jangalon main paaya jaataa he
 In Africa, it is slightly smaller than the famous gorilla, but is ahead of all apes in intelligence
 anya sab vaanron kii apeksha chimpanzi kii akruti manushyon se adhik milti he, kintu vaakshakti kaa abhaav hone ke kaaran ye manushyon jaise samajanirmaan tathaa samskruti ke vikaas se vanchit hai
 Yet, when taught, like humans, they sit on the table, pedestal and eat food with thorns and learn to do many other things like men

 Vishwamitra was a noted sage of the Vedic period
 rishi vishwamitra bade hi pratapi or tejasvi mahapurush the
 He was a great mighty and Prajavatsal king before taking the sage religion
 vishwamitra ji ko gayatri mantra kaa drushtaant hua
 Prajapati's sons were Kush, Kush's sons Kushnabh and Kushnabh's son Raja Gadhi
 vishwamitra ji unheen gadhi ke putr the
 Vishwamitra is derived from the word Vishwa and Mitra which means friendship or love with everyone
 ek din raja vishwamitra apni sena ko lekar vashishtha rishi ke ashram main gayi
 Vishwamitra saluted him and sat there
 vashishtha ji ne vishwamitra ji kaa yathochit aadar satkar kiya or unase kuch din ashram main hi rah kar aatithy grahan karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Considering that there is a large army with me and Vashistha will suffer for my hospitality with the army, Vishwamitra humbly asked for permission to go but after Vashishtha's extreme request, he accepted his hospitality for a short time
 
 vashishtha ji ne nandini gau kaa aahvaan karke vishwamitra tathaa unki sena ke liye chah prakaar ke vyanjan tathaa samast prakaar ke sukh suvidha kii vyavastha kar diya
 Vishwamitra and all the people who came with him were very pleased with the hospitality of Vashisht ji
 nandini gau kaa chamatkaar dekhakar vishwamitra ne us gau ko vashishtha ji se maanga par vashishtha ji bole rajan! yah gau meraa jivan he or ise main kisi bhi keemat par kisi ko nahin de saktaa
 At the instance of Vashishtha, Vishwamitra forced him to forcefully take hold of that cow and his soldiers started beating him with a stick
 nandini gau ne krodhit hokar un sainikon se apana bandhan chhudaa liya or vashishtha ji ke paas aakar vilaap karne lagi
 Vashist ji said that o Nandini! This king is my guest, so i cannot curse him and because of his huge army, he cannot win in war also
 main swayan ko vivash anubhav kar rahaa hoon
 Hearing these words from her, Nandini said, "O Brahmarshi!" You command me, i will destroy this Kshatriya king with his huge army in a moment
 or koi upaay na dekh kar vashishtha ji ne nandini ko anumati de di
 On getting the orders, Nandini produced the mighty warriors with the most powerful weapons of fire from the yogic forces, who soon started cutting the enemy army like carrot radish
 apni sena kaa naash hote dekh vishwamitra ke sau putr atyant kupit ho vashishtha ji ko maarane daude
 Vashistha left one of them and consumed the rest
 apni sena tathaa putron ke nasht ho jane se vishwamitra bade duhkhi huye
 Handing over the throne to his remaining son, he went to the Himalayan shrines to do penance
 kathor tapasya karke vishwamitra ji ne mahadev ji ko prasann kar liya ore unase divya shaktiyon ke saath sampoorn dhanurvidya ke gyaan kaa vardaan praapt kar liya
 In this way Vishwamitra, after getting the knowledge of the whole archery, reached Vasishtha's ashram to take revenge
 unhen lalkaar kar vishwamitra ne agnibaan chalaa diya
 Vashistha also took his bow and said that i am standing in front of you, attack me
 cruddh hokar vishwamitra ne ek ke baad ek aagneyastra, varunastra, rudrastra, indrastra tathaa pashupathastra ek saath chhod diya jinhen vashishtha ji ne apane maarak astron se maarg main hi nasht kar diya
 Vishwamitra got more angry on this, Manavastra, Mohanastra, Gandharvastra, Jumbhanastra, Daranastra, Vajra, Brahmapash, Kalpash, Varunpash, Pinaka Dhanush, Dandastra, Paishachastra, Kraunchastra, Dharmachakra, Kalachakra, Vishnuchakra, Vyavastra, Manthanastra, Manthanastra Put all the weapons using Vidyadhar, Kalastra etc
 vashishtha ji ne un sabko nasht karke un par brahmand astr chhod diya
 The whole world began to suffer from suffering with the fierce light and deafening sound of the cosmic weapon
 sab rishi-muni unase prarthana karne lage ki aapane vishwamitra ko parrast kar diya he
 Now you calm the flame produced by the cosmic weapon
 is praarthana se dravit hokar unhone brahmand astr ko waapas bulaayaa or mantron se use shant kiya
 Thinking this way, he along with his wife walked towards the south
 unhone tapasya karte huye ann kaa tyaag kar keval falon par jeevanyaapan karnaa armbh kar diya
 Pleased with his penance, Brahma ji conferred upon him the post of Rajarshi
 is pad ko praapt karke bhi, yah sochakar ki brahma ji ne mujhe keval rajarshi kaa hi pad diya maharishi-devarshi aadi kaa nahin, ve duhkhi hi huye
 They started thinking that my penance is still incomplete
 mujhe ek baar phir se ghor tapasya karnaa chaiye
 " is bich ikshvaku vansh main trishanku naam ke ek raja huye
 The hung body wanted to go to heaven, so he requested Vashishtha for this, but Vashistha expressed his inability for this work
 trishanku ne yahi prarthana vashishtha ji ke putron se bhi kii,jo dakshin praant main ghor tapasya kar rahe the
 Vashistha's sons said that you want to do the work which our father could not do
 aisa prathit hota he ki tu hamaare pita kaa apmaan karne ke liye yahan aayaa he
 By saying this way, Hungku got angry and called abusive words to Vashistha's sons
 vashishtha ji ke putron ne rusht hokar trishanku ko chandal ho jane kaa shaap de diya
 Due to the curse, Hung became Chandal and his ministers and courtiers left him
 phir bhi unhone sasharir swarg jane kii ichha kaa parityag nahin kiya
 He went to Vishwamitra and said that he requested to fulfill his wish
 vishwamitra ne kaha tum meri sharan main aaye ho
 i will definitely fulfill your wish
 itnaa kahkar vishwamitra ne apane un chaaron putron ko bulaayaa jo dakshin praant main apni patni ke saath tapasya karte huye unhen praapt huye the or unase yajna kii saamagree ekatrit karne ke liye kaha
 Then he called his disciples and ordered that all the sages and sages residing in the forest including the sons of Vashistha should be invited to join the yagna
 sabhi rishi-muniyon ne unke nimantran ko sweekaar kar liya kintu vashishtha ji ke putron ne yah kahkar us nimantran ko asweekaar kar diya ki jis yajna main yajmaan chandal or purohit kshatriya ho us yajna kaa bhaag ham sweekaar nahin kar sakate
 On hearing this, Vishwamitra got angry and tied him in Kalpash and cursed him to go to Yamlok and wandered in the vagina for seven hundred years and started preparing for the yagna
 vishwamitra ke shaap se vashishtha ji ke putr yamalok chale gayi
 Fearful of the result of Vashishtha's sons, all the sage sages supported Vishwamitra in the yagna
 yajna kii samaapti par vishwamitra ne sab devataaon ko naam le lekar apane yajna bhaag grahan karne ke liye aahvaan kiya kintu koi bhi devtaa apana bhaag lene nahin aayaa
 Enraged at this, Vishwamitra took Ardhya in his hand and said, "hung! i send you to heaven with the strength of my penance
 itnaa kah kar vishwamitra ne mantra padhate huye akaash main jal chhidaka or raja trishanku sharir sahit akaash main chadhate huye swarg ja pahunche
 Indra said angrily that the fool came! Your master has cursed you, so you are not fit to live in heaven
 indra ke aisa kehete hi trishanku sir ke bal prithvi par girane lage or vishwamitra se apni raksha kii prarthana karne lage
 Vishwamitra ordered them to stay there and they hang themselves headlong in the balance
 trishanku kii pidaa kii kalpana karke vishwamitra ne usee sthaan par apni tapasya ke bal se swarg kii sristi kar di or naye taare tathaa dakshin disha main saptarshi mandal bana diya
 After this, he thought of creating a new Indra, so that all the gods including Indra got scared and started pleading with Vishwamitra
 ve bole ki hamane trishanku ko keval isaliye lautaa diya tha ki ve guru ke shaap ke kaaran swarg main nahin rah sakate the
 On hearing of Indra, Vishwamitra said that i have promised to send it to heaven, so this heaven circle created by me will always be there and Hung will forever rule in this Nakshatra Mandala immortal
 isse santusht hokar indradi devtaa apane apane sthanon ko waapas chale gayi
 After the deities had gone, Vishwamitra also went to the east to do austerity to get the position of Brahmin
 is tapasya ko bhang karne ke liye naanaa prakaar ke vighn upasthit hue kintu unhone bina krodh kiye hi un sabakaa nivaaran kiya
 At the end of the period of penance, when he sat to take food, Indra asked for food as a Brahmin beggar
 vishwamitra ne sampoorn bhojan us yaachak ko de diya or swayan niraahaar rah gayi
 After giving food to Indra, Vishwamitra thought in his mind that perhaps the time has not come for me to get food, so this vip has become present as a petitioner, i should do austerity now
 atev ve maun rahakar phir dirghakaalin tapasya main leen ho gayi
 This time he stopped breathing with pranayama and meditated Mahadaruna
 is tap se prabhavit devataaon ne brahmaji se nivedan kiya ki bhagwan! vishwamitra kii tapasya ab paraakaashtha ko pahunch gai he
 Now they have crossed the boundaries of anger and attachment
 ab inke tej se sara sansar prakashit ho uthaa he
 The glory of the sun and the moon has also faded in front of their light
 atev aap prasann hokar inaki abhilaashaa purna kijiye
 Hearing these words of the Gods, Brahma ji conferred upon him the title of Brahmin, but Vishwamitra said, "O God! When you have given me this boon, then also give me Omkar, Shatkar and all the four Vedas
 prabho! apni tapasya ko main tabhi safal samajhungaa jab vashishtha ji mujhe brahman or brahmarshi maan lenge
 After listening to Vishwamitra, all the gods went to Vasishtha and told him the whole story
 unki tapasya kii katha sunakar vashishtha ji vishwamitra ke paas pahunche or unhen apane hriday se laga kar bole ki vishwamitra ji! aap vastav main brahmarshi hai
 i accept you as a Brahmin from today

 lahartate do mukhya qismon ke hote hai: a logic gate or logic gate is a device whose output is a logical function of the current signals or earlier signals present at its input
 yah bhautik yukti ho sakati he yaa koi adarshikrut yukti
 Nowadays most semiconductor logic gates are used, but in theory they can also be made from electromagnetic relays, liquid logic, pressure logic, optical logic, molecules etc
 booleey logic se jin algorithm kaa varnan kiya ja saktaa he unhen in bhautik geton se un algoridmon ko saakaar rup bhi diya ja saktaa he 
 Just as a door can be in two stages - 'open or closed', the output of a logic gate can also be 'high or low'
 logic get, and or or jaise saral bhi ho sakate hai or ek computor jitna jatil bhi
 a logic gate built using a diode is the simplest logic gate
 kintu iske keval AND tathaa OR get hi banaaye ja sakate hai, 'inwarter' nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Hence it can be called an 'incomplete logic family'
 invar sahit sabhi logic get banane main sakasham hone ke liye kisi prakaar ke pravardhak kii jarurat hogi
 Therefore, the use of relay, vacuum nozzles or transistors is indispensable to create a 'complete logic family'
 bipolar transistoron kaa prayog karke bana logic parivaar register-transistor logic kehalaata he
 This was used in early integrated circuits
 iske baad vibhinn drushtiyon se sudhaar karte hue diod-transistor logic or transistor-transistor logic aaye
 Now almost all the transistors have been replaced by MOSFET, which causes less IC to occupy and less energy to work
 vartmaan main prayukt logic parivaar kaa naam complimentry metal-oxide-semiconductor he
 The output of a three-stage logic gate has three different states
 ye hai - hai, lo or hai impidence 
 From the point of view of high intensity, there is no role
 kintu apane hai impidence vaali avasthaa ke kaaran in yuktiyon kaa upyog data bas par vibhinn yuktiyon se data bhejne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Except for the device which is sending data to the bus, all other devices connected to that bus are converted to 'high Impedance State'
 is prakaar ye anya yuktiyaan ek prakaar se bas se judi hokar bhi usase alag hai kyonki bas or inke output ke bich 'hai impidence' maujuud he
 There are two types of rational gates - combinational logic and sequential logic
 sangyojan tark kaa output uske inputon kii vartmaan avasthaa par hi keval nirbhar karata he na ki unki pehle kii avasthaa yaa avasthaaon par
 In other words, it can be said that they do not have memory
 iske kuch udhaaharan hai - binary aidar, incoder, dicoder aadi
 Logic gates can also be used for data storage
 iske liye ltch paripath yaa 'flip-flop' kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 When multiple flip-flops are added in parallel, multi-bit data can be stored in it
 ise register kehete hai
 a type of 'memory' exists in a system consisting of flip-flops
 isi liye inase computor kii memory banaayi jaati he
 There are many types of memory of a computer
 keval NOR yaa keval NAND kaa prayog karke kisi bhi anya logic get kaa kaam liya ja saktaa he
 Therefore these logic gates are called 'universal logic gate'
 keval AND, yaa keval OR, yaa keval NOT geton kaa prayog karke icchaanusaar koi bhi logic falan banane sambhav nahin he
 Therefore AND, OR and NOT gates are not universal logic gates

 raman prakirnan yaa raman prabhaav photone kanon ke lacheele vitaran ke bare main he
 It was discovered by the famous Indian scientist Mr
 CV Raman
 raman prabhaav ke anusaar, jab koi ekvarni prakaash dravon or thoson se hokar gujarata he to usamen aaptit prakaash ke saath atyalp tivrata kaa kuch anya varnon kaa prakaash dekhne main aata he
 In 1930, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Chandrasekhar Venkataraman for his discovery
 raman kii puri shiksha-diksha bharat main hi hui
 Rs 200 itself By designing a spectrometer, we could make such an important discovery only on the strength of diligence, diligence and exclusive research
 shuru main raman ne surya ke prakaash ko bangnee filter se guzaar kar praapt bangnee prakaash kiran punj ko drav se guzaara
 The output beam was mainly of purple color, but after passing through the green filter, the presence of green rays in it was also seen in very small quantity
 raman prabhaav rasinic yogicon kii aantarik sanrachana samajhane ke liye bhi mahatvapurn he
 This effect is quite an important discovery for scientists
 rashtriya vigyaan diwas ke din bharat ke vibhinn kshetron main vigyaan ke gatividhiyon kon badhaava dene vaale kaarykamo kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 After repeating the experiment on more than 60 different liquids, it was ensured that all the fluids represented the Raman spectrum
 drav badalane se keval usase prakirnit spectrumi rekha kaa rang badalata he
 In the experiments so far, the effect was being confirmed by just looking
 kintu raman jaanate the ki jab tak raman-rekhaon kii tarangadairdhyon or unki aapekshik tivrata kaa maapan nahin kiya jayega tab tak na to prabhaav kii santoshjanak vyakhya kii ja sakegi or na hi vaigyanik jagat main manyata praapt hogi
 For this he used a quartz spectrograph, the quantitative results of which were published in the Indian Journal of Physics on March 31, 1928
 yah ek adbhut prabhaav he, isaki khoj ke ek dashak baad hi 2000 rasinic yogicon kii aantarik sanrachana nishchit kii gai thi
 After this, the internal structure of the crystal was also explored
 raman prabhaav ke anusaar prakaash kii prakruti or swabhaav main tab parivartan hota he jab vah kisi paardarshee madhyam se nikalataa he
 This medium can be anything solid, fluid and gaseous
 yah ghatana tab ghatati he, jab madhyam ke anu prakaash urja ke kanon ko prakirnit kar dete hai
 This happens in the same way as the striker splashes the pieces on the carrom board
 photone kii urja yaa prakaash kii prakruti main hone vaale atisookshm parivartanon se madhyam kii aantarik anu sanrachana kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Raman was a very enthusiastic, hard working, and brilliant man
 19 varsh kii aayu main unhone pratham shrenee main pratham rahete hue bhautikee main em
e
 kiya or vitt sevaaon kii pratiyogi pariksha main safal hokar kalakatta main upmahaalekh adhikri ban gaye
 The desire to pass some taxes and interest in science linked him to the Indian Association for Cultivation of Sciences, a science research institute established by Mahendra Lal Sarkar
 ve din bhar apane daayitv kaa nirvaah karne main vyast rahete or shaam se der raat tak prayogshaala main
 His early work was related to the exploration of science associated with the working of musical instruments
 raman kaa vigyaan ke prati samarpan itnaa teevr tha ki 1917 main jab unhen kalakatta vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee ke palit professor banaae jane kaa prastaav mila to apni sarkari naukari chhodkar lagbhag aadhi tankhaah par unhone is pad ko sweekaar kar liya
 Raman's entire education took place in India and till now his contact with other scientists of the world was through books and articles printed in international research papers
 1921 main pehali baar ek adhyayan yatra par unhen videsh jane kaa avasar mila
 The blue-blue waters of the ocean caught their attention while traveling by ship
 lard raile ne akaash ke nile rang kii safal vyakhya vayukanon se prakaash-vikirnan ke aadhaar par kii thi kintu sagar jal kaa nila rang unhone akaash kaa jal main pratibimb maan liya tha
 This interpretation was not acceptable to Raman
 unako lagata tha ki jo siddhant vaayu ke nile rang ke liye uttaradaayi tha vahi jal ke nile rang ke liye bhi hona chahie, isliye, apni vaapasi yatra main unhone ek jebi spectrummapi apane saath rakhaa
 Ss During the voyage on a vessel called Narkunda, he carried out some experiments of scattering from glaciers and water with the help of this device
 bharat pahunchate-pahunchate unhen vishwaas ho gaya ki unka vichaar sahi tha
 He sent 'a short article to Nature in this regard and got absorbed in his experiments with light scattering with his team of young scientists
 7 varsh ke athak parishram or saikadon dravon evam thoson se prakaash-prakirnan kaa adhyayan karne ke baad aakhir 28 farvari, 1928 ko unhone raman prabhaav kii ghoshnaa kii
 Since 1987, this day has been celebrated in India as National Science Day
 raman prabhaav kii upyukt vyakhya keval kwantum siddhant ke aadhaar par kii ja sakati he, jahaan ekvarni prakaash punj ko urja yukt kanon ke pravaah ke rup main dekha jaataa he

 usne ikdala ke qile main sharan le rakhi thi, sultan firoz antatah qile par adhikaar karne main asafal hokar 1355 i
 main waapas dilli aa gaya

 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Thus it can be said that Sultan Firuz Tughlaq did not undertake any military campaign during his reign for the expansion of the empire and whatever campaign he did, only to save the empire
 rajasav vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne apane shashan kaal main 24 kshtdaayak karon ko samaapt kar diya or keval 4 kar ‘karaaj’, ‘khums’, ‘jazia’, evam 'zakaat' ko vasuul karne kaa aadesh diya

 'daarul-shafa' naamak ek rajkeey aspataal kaa nirmaan karavaaya, jisamen garibon kaa muft ilaaj hota tha
 During the reign of Firoz, the number of slaves reached about 1,80,000

 Some slaves were sent to the provinces and the rest were kept in the center

 He made military posts hereditary, affecting the ability of soldiers to check
 khums kaa 4 / 5 bhaag phir se sainikon ko dene ke aadesh die gayi
 After some time his terrible result came to light
 firoz tululaq ko kuch itihaaskaar dharmandh evam ashishnu shaasha maanate hai
 Probably he was the first Sultan of Delhi Sultanate, who followed strict Islamic rules and gave importance to the Ulema class in administrative work
 nyaay vyavastha par punah dharmaguruon kaa prabhaav sthapit ho gaya
 Mukti used to explain the laws
 musalmaan aparaadhiyon ko mrityu dand dena band kar diya gaya
 Feroze was a staunch Sunni Muslim
 usne hindu janata ko ‘jimmy’ kaha or hindu brahmanon par jazia kar lagaaya

C
 Majumdar has stated that, "firuz was the most fanatical of this era and the Sinkadar Lodi and Aurangzeb in this region was outgoing
 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas
 usne 'jiyauddin barani' evam 'shams-e-siraaj afif' ko apana sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Barani composed 'fatwa-e-jahandari' and 'date-e-firozshahi'

 Firoz Tuglaq was the first ruler of the Sultanate who got the details of the man of the state
 khwaja hisamuddin ke ek anumaan ke anusaar- firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal kii vaarshik aay 6 karod 75 lakh takaad Firoz Tughlaq issued a large number of coins made of a mixture of copper and silver under the currency system, which were probably called 'adha' and 'egypt'
 firoz tululaq ne ‘shanshgani’ kaa nayaa sikaa chalavaaya tha
 He inscribed the name of his son or successor 'fatah Khan' with his name on the coins
 firoz ne apane ko caliph kaa nib pukaara tathaa sikkon par caliph kaa naam ankit karavaaya
 The rule of Ferozeshah Tughlaq was based on welfare autocracy
 vah pratham sultan tha, jisne vijayon tathaa yudhon kii tulana main apni praja kii bhautik unnati ko shreshth sthaan diya, shaasha ke kartavyon kaa vistrut kiya tathaa islam dharm ko rajya shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya

 firozshah tululaq kii safaltaaon kaa shrey uske pradhanmantri 'khan-e-jahaan makabool' kaa diya jaataa he
 Sultan Firoz Shah Tughlaq died in September 1388 AD

 narmada nadi par hai The story narrated by the twenty-seventh effigy named Malayavati is as follows - Vikramaditya was a very famous and majestic king and had some faith in running the kingdom
 veerta or vidwata kaa adbhut sangam the
 There was no limit to his weapon knowledge and scripture knowledge
 ve raaj-kaaj se bachaa samay akasar shaasron ke adhyayan main lagaate the or isi dhyey se unhone rajmahal ke ek hisse main vishaal pustkaalay banavaa rakhaa tha
 One day when he was reading a religious book, he got the reference of King Bali at one place
 unhone raja bali vaala sara prasang padhaa to pataa chalaa ki raja bali bade daanveer or vachan ke pakke the
 He was such a mighty and great king that Indra was afraid of his power
 devataaon ne bhagwaan vishnu se prarthana kii ki ve bali kaa kuch upaay karen to vishnu ne vaaman rup dharaa
 Vamana took the form and received everything from him in charity and forced him to go to Hades
 jab unki katha vikram ne padhi to sochaa ki itane bade daanveer ke darshan zaroor karne chahie
 He considered that he should be pleased by worshiping Lord Vishnu and asked him the way to meet the demon king Bali
 aisa vichaar man main aate hi unhone raaj-paat or moh-maaya se apane aapako alag kar liya tathaa mahamantri ko rajbhaar saunpkar jangal kii ore prasthaan kar gaye
 In the forest, he started austerities and started praising Lord Vishnu
 unki tapasya bahut lambi thi
 Initially they used to have only one meal
 kuch dinon baad unhone vah bhi tyaag diya tathaa fal or kand-mul aadi khaakar rahane lage
 a few days later he gave up everything and continued to do austerity by drinking only water
 itani kathor tapasya se ve bahut kamazor ho gaye or saadhaaran rup se uthne-baithne main bhi unhen kaaphi mushkil hone lagi
 Gradually many more ascetics came near his austerity site
 koi ek pair par khadaa hokar tapasya karne laga to koi ek haath uthaakar, koi kaanton par letkar tapasya main leen ho gaya to koi gardan tak baaluu main dhansakar
 Only the name of God began to be discussed all around and the holy atmosphere was created
 vikram ne kuch samay baad jal bhi lenaa chhod diya or bilkul niraahaar tapasya karne lage
 Now his body became even more weak and only the structure of bones did not come
 koi dekhtaa to dayaa aa jaati, magar raja vikramaditya ko koi chintaa nahin thi
 While worshiping Vishnu, if his life had gone out, he would have gone straight to heaven and if Vishnu had been seen, then the path to meet the demon king Bali would have paved
 ve puri lagan se apane abhisht kii prapti ke liye tapasyarat rahe
 He has no love for life and body
 raja vikramaditya kaa huliya aisa ho gaya tha ki koi bhi dekhakar nahin kah saktaa tha ki ve mahapratapi or sarvshereshth hai
 a yogi who did penance near the king asked him why he was doing such severe penance
 vikram kaa jawaab tha- "ihalok se mukti or paralok sudhaar ke liye
 "the ascetic told him that austerity is not the work of kings
 raja ko rajkaaj ke liye ishwar dwaara janm diya jaataa he or yahi uskaa karm he
 If he turns his face to the kingdom, he turns his back on his deeds
 shaasron main kaha gaya he ki manushya ko apane karm se munh nahin modana chahie
 Vikram told him in a very serious voice that one should never turn away from religion even while doing karma
 unhone jab usase poocha ki kya shaasron main kisi bhi sthiti main dharm se vimukh hone ko kaha gaya he to tapasvi ekadam chup ho gaya
 His reasoned reply did not leave him worth asking any further
 raja ne apni tapasya jari rakhi
 One day the king fainted due to excessive weakness and came to consciousness after a long time
 vah tapasvi ek baar phir unke paas aayaa or unase tapasya chhod dene ko bolaa
 He said that since kings are householders, they should not meditate like ascetics
 grihasth ko ek seemaa ke bheetar hi rahakar tapasya kerani chahie
 When he repeatedly reminded the king of householder religion and motivated him to do household work, the king said that he is doing penance for peace of mind
 tapasvi kuch nahin bolaa or ve phir tapasya karne lage
 There was a weakness - once again he became unconscious
 jab kai ghanton baad ve hosh main aae to unhone paaya ki unka sar bhagwaan vishnu kii god main he
 Seeing Lord Vishnu, he came to know that the ascetic who stopped him from penance was none other than Lord Vishnu himself
 vikram ne uthakar unhen sashtaang pranaam kiya to bhagwaan ne poocha ve kyon itnaa kathor tap kar rahe hai
 Vikram said that he has to find a way to meet King Bali
 bhagwaan vishnu ne unhen ek shankh dekar kaha ki samudr ke bichon-bich pataal lok jane kaa rasta he
 After blowing this conch on the beach, he will see the sea god and he will show him the way to reach King Bali
 shankh dekar vishnu antadhryaan ho gaye
 After seeing Vishnu, Vikram again regained his pre-meditative health and attained the same limitless power
 shankh lekar ve samudr ke paas aae or puri shakti se shankh phunkane lage
 Samudra Dev appeared and the sea water split into two parts
 samudr ke bichon-bich ab bhoomi maarg dikhaai dene laga
 The king continued on that path
 kaaphi chalane ke baad ve pataal lok pahunch gaye
 When they reached the gate of King Bali's palace, the doorkeepers asked him the purpose of coming
 vikram ne unhen bataaya ki raja bali ke darshan ke liye mrityulok ke yahan aae hai
 a soldier took his message and after a long time came to him and said that King Bali cannot meet him yet
 unhone baar-baar raja se milane kaa anurodh kiya par raja bali taiyaar nahin hue
 The king, disgusted and desperate, cut off his head with his sword
 jab prahariyon ne yah khabar raja bali ko di to unhone amrit dalwakar vikram ko jivit karvaa diya
 As soon as he was alive, Vikram again expressed his desire to see King Bali
 is baar prahari sandesh lekar lautaa ki raja bali unase maha shivaratri ke din milenge
 Vikram felt that Bali had sent this message only to avoid it
 unke dil par chot lagi or unhone phir talwaar se apni gardan kaat lee
 The disturbance came true in the prairies and he sent the news of Vikram's sacrifice to King Bali
 raja bali samaj gaye ki vah vyakti drudh nishchayi he or bina bhent kiye janevaala nahin he
 He then sent the nectar by the servants and sent a message to them that they agreed to make the offering
 naukaron ne amrit chhidakkar unhen jivit kiya tathaa mahal main chalakar bali se bhet karne ko kaha
 When they met Raja Bali, King Bali asked them the reason for coming out after suffering so much
 vikram ne kaha ki dharmik granthon main unke bare main bahut kuch varnit he tathaa unki daanveerta or tyaag kii charchaa sarvatra hoti he, isliye ve unase milane ko utsuk the
 Raja Bali was very pleased with him and gifted a red coral to Vikram and said that he can give everything if he asks for coral
 muunge ke bal par asambhav kaary bhi sambhav ho sakate hai
 Vikram, after taking leave from Raja Bali, was pleased and returned to the dead of death
 pataal lok ke pravesh dwaar ke baahar phir vahi anant gaharaai vaala samudr bah rahaa tha
 When he blew the conch given to Lord Vishnu, the sea was again divided into two parts and the same landward path appeared in between
 us bhoomi maarg par chalakar ve samudr tat tak pahunch gayi
 That road disappeared and the sea again started flowing undone
 ve apane rajya kii ore chal pade
 On the way he found a woman mourning
 uske bal bikhare hue the or chehre par gahare vishaad ke bhav the
 Upon approaching, it is revealed that her husband has died and is now completely destitute
 vikram kaa dil uske dukh ko dekhakar pasij gaya tathaa unhone use santvanaa di
 The sacrificed coral asks for life for him

 Currency exchange is a foreign currency exchange agreement between two parties for exchange related aspects of debt in one currency and equivalent aspects having net present value of debt in the other currency
 dekhen videshi mudra derevative
 mudra vinimay tulanaatmak laabh ke dwaara prerit hote hai
 Currency exchange should be treated separately from the central bank's cash exchange
 mudra vinimay bina taiyaari ke vyutpann hai, evam ve byaaj dar vinimay se ghanishtha rup se sambandhit hai
 However, unlike an interest rate exchange, currency exchange may involve exchange of principal
 mudra vinimay dwaara rin vinimay kar sakane ke teen alag-alag tareeke hai: The simplest currency exchange structure is to exchange only the principal with the counterparty, at a rate currently accepted, at a certain time in the future
 is tarah ke samjhaute main vaayada sanvida yaa bhavi saude ke samatuly ek kaary sampadit hota he
 Finding the cost of obtaining a counterparty, and negotiating with them, makes exchange more expensive than alternative derivatives as a method of determining short-term forward exchange rates
 haalanki, adhik lambii avadhi ke bhavi saude ke liye, aam taur par 10 varshon tak, jahaan derevative vikalp haalanki lambii avadhi ke bhavishya ke liye vyapak, aamtaur par upar se 10 saal ke hai jahaan kray-vikray daron kaa antar vaikalpik vyutpannon ke liye adhik vyapak hota he, maatr mooldhan vaali mudra vinimayon kaa prayog aksar agaau daron ko nirdhaarit karne ke ek kifayati tareeke ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 This form of currency exchange is also known as f-x-exchange
 ek anya mudra vinimay sanrachana uparokt mooldhan ke rin ko byaaj dar vinimay ke saath mishrit karnaa he
 In such an exchange, the expenses are not deducted before the cash flow of interest is paid to the counterparty as they are held in different currencies
 chunki prayek paksh anya paksh kii taraf se safaltaapurvak udhaar letaa he, is tarah ke vinimay ko aage-peeche rin bhi kaha jaataa he
 At the end here, but certainly not less important, the only interest payment for a loan of similar size and duration is the exchange of cash flows
 pun:, chunki yah ek mudra vinimay he, vinimay kiye gaye nakad pravaah alag-alag moolyavarg main hote hai or isaliye unamem se kharch kii katautee nahin kii jaati he
 An example of one such exchange is the exchange of fixed-rate US dollar interest payments with a floating-rate interest payment in euros
 is prakaar ke vinimay ko paar-mudra byaaj dar vinimay, yaa paar-mudra vinimay ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 There are two main uses of currency exchange: udhaaharan ke liye, swiss frank kaa karj lene kii aavashyaktaa vaali america main sthit ek company or amareeki dollar main samaan vartmaan mulya kaa karj lene kii aavashyaktaa vaali switzarland main sthit ek company, donon hi companiyaan nimnaankit main se kisi ek ko apanaakar vinimay daron main utaar-chadhaav ke prati apane jokhim ko kam kar sakati hai: Currency exchange was originally conceived in the 1970s to avoid foreign exchange controls in the United Kingdom
 us samay he, britain kii companiyon ko america dollar kaa karj lene ke liye premium kaa bhugtan karnaa padataa tha
 To avoid this, UK companies entered into back-to-back loan agreements with United States companies seeking sterling
 While such restrictions on currency exchange have become rare, savings are still available from back-and-forth loans due to comparative advantage
 paar-mudra byaaj dar vinimay 1981 main bank vishwa dwaara ibiem ke saath nakad pravaah kaa vinimay kar swiss frank or german mark praapt karne ke liye kiya gaya
 Salomon Brothers negotiated the deal for an estimated sum of 210 million dollars and for a period of more than ten years
 2008 ke vaishvik vittiya sankat ke dauraan, sanyukt rajya sangheey sanchay pranali dwaara kendriya bank taralata vinimay kii sthapana karne ke liye mudra vinimay lenden sanrachana kaa prayog kiya gaya
 In these, the Federal Reserve and Central Bank of a developed or stable emerging economy are ready to exchange domestic currencies at the current prevailing market exchange rate and to return the exchange at a future fixed date at the same currency exchange rate
 Let's agree
 kendriya bank taralata vinimay kaa uddeshy "videshi bazaaron ko america dollaron main taralata pradaan karnaa" he
 While central bank liquidity exchanges and currency exchanges are structurally similar, currency exchanges are commercial transactions driven by comparative advantage, whereas central bank liquidity exchanges are contingent debt of US dollars in foreign markets and it is not currently known whether in the long run Whether the dollar or United States will be beneficial to America

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race
 british logon ne prachaarit kiya ki lagbhag 1700 i

 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race
 par abhi bhi itihaaskaar or bhashavid aaryon kii janmabhumi kii khoj kar rahe hai
 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea
 vahiin se unke kabeeley duniya ke kai deshon main pahunche
 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
