 William James, in an article 'what is an emotion?', Argued that most emotional experiences are caused by physical changes
 lagbhag isi samay danish manovaigyanik karl laing ne bhi miltaa julata siddhant pesh kiya, isliye ise james-laing siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 According to this theory and its facts, a change of circumstance leads to physical change
 jaise ki james kehete hai "shaareerik badlaav hone kii avadharana hi bhaavana he "
 james daawa karte hai ki "hamen udaasi anubhav hoti hai kyonki ham rote hai, ladaai ke samay krodhit hote hai, kaanpane ke kaaran darate hai or aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki, maafi maangate hue, krodh yaa dar ke samay ham na royen, na laden yaa na kaanpen
 This theory has been proved by experiments, in which the desired emotion is obtained by changing the conditions of the body
 is prakaar ke prayogon ko chiktsa main bhi prayukt kiya gaya he 
 james-laing ke siddhant ko aksar galat samajha jaataa he kyonki yah virodhabhasi he
 Most people believe that emotions promote emotion-related actions: such as "i'm crying because I'm depressed", or "I ran because I'm scared"
 In contrast, james-lang's theory emphasizes that we first react according to the situation, and after that we relate our actions to emotional response
 is prakaar se, bhavanaaen hamaari apni kriyaaon kii vyakhya karti hai tathaa inhen vyavasthit karti hai
 james-lang's theory is now rejected by most students
 tim dalgleish ke nimnlikhit kathan ke anusaar: The james-lang theory has remained influential
 Its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity
 Most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified james-lang view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion
 " james-laing ke siddhant ke saath ek samasya yah he ki yah kriya ke parinaam par kendrit he, na ki bhaavnaatmak anubhavon se hone vaale shaareerik prabhaavon par
 
 From the information found in the mapping of the nerves of the brain structure, the neurobiological interpretation of human emotions is that emotion is a dear or unpleasant condition that arises in the breastmilk's brain

 ye gandh dhire dhire tantrikaon kaa khaakaa banaati gayin jisase aage chal kar hamaare mastishk kii sanrachana bani
 Emotions are believed to be related to the functioning of the area of the brain that instructs us, motivates our behavior and explains the importance of the events around us
 broka, pepez or maclin kii mahatvapurn khojein bataati hai ki bhavanaaen mastishk ke madhya main sanrachanaon ke samooh se judi hoti he, jise limbik system kehete hai, jisame hypothalamas, singulate cortex, hippocampi or anya sanrachanaayen shaamil hai
 Recent research has shown that some of these limbic structures, unlike others, are not directly related to emotions in that way, while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater importance
 is baat ke paryaapt pramaan he ki baanyaa prifrantal cortex us uttejnaa se kriyasheel hota he jo sakaaratmak soch se utpann hoti he
 If the attractive stimulus is able to activate a selective part of the brain, then the logic must be completely reversed, that is, selective activation of that part of the brain must produce a stimulus in order to be judged more positively
 It was performed with provocative scenes featuring medium attraction, and was later expanded and repeated to include negative stimuli
 prifrantal cortex main neurobiological modelon ne bhaawanaaon ke do vipareet parinaam bataae
 valence model ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki gussa, jo ek nakaaratmak bhaavana he, daahine prifrantal cortex ko kriyasheel karegaa

 However, there are still many questions that remain unanswered as to what is the better opposite definition of the approach in the prefrontal cortex, moving away, with no response, but strength and resistance or passive outcome without response
 Researches on shame and behavioral barriers have supported the action tendency model
 "homeostatic feelings" are the emotions generated by the internal state of the body, which organize our behavior
 pyaas, bhukh, garm yaa thanda anubhav karnaa, neend se vanchit mahasoos karnaa, namak khaane kii ichha tathaa hawa kii ichha, ye sabhi homeostatic bhaawanaaon ke udhaaharan hai; inamen se prayek shaareerik pranali dwaara diya gaya sanket he jo kahata he ki "sab kuch thik nahin he
 Drink / Eat / Get in the shade / Wear something warm / Sleep / Lick the salty piece / Breathe
 "when the balance of any of these systems is disturbed, we begin to experience the homeostatic feeling and this feeling gives us that, Which is necessary to maintain the balance of that system
 dard ek homeostatic bhaavana he jo hamen bataati he "sab kuch thik nahin he
 Step back and escape "
 kuch aise siddhant hai jo tark dete hai ki, sangyanatmak kriya - ek nirnay, moolyankan yaa vichaar - kisi bhaavana ko utpann karne ke liye aavashyak he
 According to Richard Laurus it is necessary to validate the fact that emotion arises about something or intentionally
 is prakaar kii sangyanatmak kriya chetan yaa avchetan ho sakati hai tathaa vaicharik prakriya kaa rup le sakati he yaa nahin le sakati he
 Here is an influential theory of Laurus: Emotion is an obstacle that arises in the following order: 1
) Cognitive appraisal — The person makes a rational assessment of the phenomenon that indicates emotion
 2
 shaareerik badlaav - sangyanatmak pratikriyaaon ke falswaroop jaivik badlaav hote hai, jaise, dil kii dhadkan kaa badhanaa yaa pituitary adrinil kii pratikriya
 3
 kriya - vyakti bhaavana ko anubhav karata he or pratikriya chunata he
 For example: Jenny sees a snake
 1
) jeni saanp ko dekhati he, jiske kaaran use dar lagata he 2
) uskaa dil jor se dhadkane lagata he
 Adrilene's blood flow is accelerated
 3
 jeni chillaati he or bhaag jaati he
 Laurus insists that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled by cognitive responses
 ye pratikriyaayein bachaav ranneeti banaati hai jo vyakti or uske vaataavaran ke badlaav ke anusaar bhaavnaatmak pratikriya banati he
 Some theories related to emotions argue that cognitive action in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts is necessary for emotion to occur

solomon hai 
 iskaa doosraa udhaaharan he, nico frijda dwaara prastaavit ek siddhant jiske anusaar moolyacan kii vajah se pravritiyaan ghatit hoti he
 It has also been suggested that emotions are commonly used as shortcuts for executing information and influencing behavior
 bhaawanaaon ke daihik or sangyanatmak siddhant kaa ek nayaa sankar siddhant avadharanatmak siddhant he
 This theory differs in the argument that bodily reactions are focused on emotions, however it emphasizes the significance of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something as found by cognitive theories
 is siddhant kaa nayaa daawa he ki is prakaar ke arth ke liye kalpana par aadhaarit sangyanaatmakataa anaavashyak he
 Rather, physical changes change themselves according to the meaningful content of emotions due to the change in the action due to some reason

 a sophisticated defense of this view was found in philosopher Jesse Prinz's book Gut Reactions and psychologist James Laird's book Feelings
 yah sanchaar aadhaarit harvard em
vaais tathaa rasel kropangeno, ke dwaara viksit siddhant he, jo bhaavnaatmak anubhavon ke kaarnon, sanrachnaao or parinaamon par dhyaan detaa he

 "this theory has been used by many researchers to better understand emotion through communication and is reviewed by Howard M
 Wise and Daniel J
 Beal in their articles Reflection on Affective Events Theory, which was published in 2005 on Research on Emotion in Published in Organizations

 This is based on the intentions of experiments which suggest that an injection of adrenalin may cause different emotional reactions of individuals despite being in the same mental state
 vyaktiyon kaa duusare vyakti kii sthiti ke anusaar vyakt kii gayi bhaavana ke anuroop gussa yaa prasannataa vyakt karte hue nirikshan kiya gaya
 Thus, the combination of status assessment and the participant taking adrenaline or placebo determined simultaneous responses
 This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Pinz's Gut Reactions

 During Watergate, Post's managing editor Howard Simmons used the nickname "deep Throat" as a clue to a notorious pornographic film that was a major cause of controversy at the time

 The stories of Woodward and Bernstein contained information that was surprisingly similar to what information investigators at the FBI found
 yah patrakarita kaa ek aisa gauravshaalee udhaaharan tha jo us samay kisi anya patrkaar ne hasil nahin kiya tha

 Woodward claimed to have placed a red flag with a flower pot on the balcony of his apartment indicating that he would meet the "deep throat"

 He said Woodward's apartment 617, located at 1718 p Street in the Northwest in Washington, had an internal courtyard and was not visible from the street
 haivil ne kaha ki niyamit rup se balakani kii jaanch karne vaala koi bhi vyakti, jaisaa ki "deep throt" kathith rup se har din karata tha, use avashya dekha gaya hoga
 Haville also stated that copies of The Times were not given in individual apartments but were handed over to the building's reception desk in the form of an unaddressed stack
 yah jaanane kaa koi tarika nahin rahaa hoga ki koun si prati woodward ke liye thi
 However, Woodward stated that the inner courtyard was a street in the early 1970s and that it had not yet been closed and that his balcony was visible from the street level to pedestrians passing by
 woodward ne kalpana kii thi ki yah paas hi ke duutavaason kii nigaraanee main maujuud epabiai ke kisi bhi vyakti ko dikhaai de saktaa tha
 He also revealed the fact that his apartment number was inscribed on the New York Times copy of Woodward
 purv padosi harman nipenberg ne kaha tha ki woodward times kii chihnit prati kii khoj main yah daawa karte hue kabhi-kabhi apane daravaaje par aate the, "main ise mint sthiti main rakhana pasand karata hoon or main apni khud kii prati lenaa pasand karata hoon"
 Furthermore, while Woodward emphasizes these precautions in his book, he also admits to talking to "deep Throat" on his home telephone

 However other commentators speculated that Felt may have had more personal reasons for leaking information to Woodward

 edgar hover ke prashansak ke rup main karte hai
 After Hoover's death, Felt was outraged and frustrated when L
 Patrick Gray, a career naval officer and attorney for the Justice Department's Civil Division, without any prior experience of law enforcement, received the FBI instead of Felt
 While Felt Bureau was a 30-year veteran, he was made a director

 kii prabandhan style se naakhush the, jo hover kii tulana main saafe taur par alag thi
 Felt selected Woodward and Bernstein because he knew that he had been assigned a robbery investigation
 nyaay vibhaag ke vakeelon yaa raashtrapati ke galat kaaryon kii jaanch kii prabharee sadan kii nyaaypalika samiti kii maang karne kii bajaay, unhone krambaddh dhang se woodward or bernastine ko jaankaree li kii jisase ki apni swayan kii pahchaan or bhagidaari ko surakshit rup se gopneey rakhte hue unki chaanbin main maargdarshan kiya ja sake
 Some traditionalists who worked for Nixon, such as Pat Buchanan and G
K
 Felt was criticized by Gordon Liddy and spoke of his belief that Nixon had been unfairly dismissed
 haalanki deep throt kii pahchaan kii pushti 30 se adhik varshon tak rahasyamay bani rahi, kuch andeh is prakaar bhi the ki 2005 main saarvajanik sweekruti se kaaphi samay pehle felt vastav main reporter ke rahasyamay strot rahe the
 Nixon said of Felt at the time that he "knows everything the FBI has to know
" " felt kaa khulaasa nahin karne kaa nicksan kaa uddeshy sambhawatah puri tarah paropkaaree nahin rahaa hoga
 There is no doubt that if Felt had publicly disclosed all that he was aware of, the man who could have caused the most damage was Nixon himself
 farvari 2005 main, nicksan ke purv white house councel samachar stanbhakaar jon dean ne bataaya ki woodward ne haal hi main bradli ko suchit kiya tha ki "deep throt" biimaar tha or vah mrityu ke kareeb tha or yah ki bradli ne deep throt kaa mrityulekh likhaa tha
 These claims were denied by both Woodward and the then-current editor of The Washington Post, Leonard Downey
 felt, vishesh rup se 1999 kii garmiyon main woodward or felt ke bich hui rahasyamay mulaaqaat ke baad kuch had tak ek sandigdh vyakti ban gaya tha
 But others had paid more attention to it over the years, such as Pat Buchanan, Henry Kissinger, then Chief Justice William Rehnquist, General Hague and, before discovering that "deep Throat" was certainly not a woman, Dean Sawyer
 31 may 2005 ko venity fere patrika ne report diya ki us samay 91 varsh kii aayu ke wiliam mark felt ne yah daawa kiya tha ki vahi vah vyakti hai jinhen kabhi "deep throt" ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Later that same day, Woodward, Bernstein and Bradley released a statement via The Washington Post confirming that the story was true
 2 june 2005 ko da washington post ne woodward dwaara likhit ek vistrut mukhya prishth nikaala jisamen unhone waterget ke pehle ke varshon main felt ke saath apni dosti ke bare main vistaar se bataaya tha
 Woodward wrote that he first met Felt by coincidence in 1970, when Woodward was a Navy lieutenant and in his mid-thirties who was sent to the White House's West Wing to hand over a packet
 felt unke thodi hi der baad ek alag mulaaqaat ke liye vahaan pahunche or pratikshalay main woodward ke bagal main aakar baith gaye
 Woodward began a conversation that eventually led to the fbi's high level of knowledge of Felt's position
 woodward, jo us samay nausena se baahar nikaalane kii taiyaari main the or jivan main apane bhavishya kii disha ko lekar nishchit nahin the, unhone felt kaa ek menter or kariyar salaahkaar ke rup main upyog karne kaa nishchay kiya or isliye unhone felt kaa phone number le liya or unke sampark main rahane lage
 Woodward eventually joined The Washington Post in August 1971, after deciding to pursue a career as a reporter
 felt, jinke bare main woodward likhte hai ki unka nicksan prashasan ke bare main kaaphi lambe samay se ek dhundhala najariya tha, unhone woodward ko tukdon main suchanaaen dena shuru kar diya, haalanki unhone soochnaaon ke aadhaar par likhi gayi kisi bhi saamagree se epabiai or nyaay vibhaag ko alag rakhane ke liye woodward se jor dekar kaha tha
 In mid-may 1972, Woodward first used the information he received from Felt in a Washington Post story, a month before the Watergate scandal, when Woodward was reporting on a man who ran for presidential candidate Alabama
 Tried to assassinate George C
 Wallace; Nixon had tasked Felt to investigate the possible murder
 ek maheene baad, vatargel ke khulaase ke kuch hi dinon baad woodward ne felt ko apane offis main bulaayaa jo vah pehla mauqaa tha jab woodward ne waterget ke bare main felt se baat kii thi
 Commenting on Felt's motivations for acting as his "deep throat" source, Woodward wrote, "felt believed that he was protecting the bureau by finding a way out, which was so secret that the FBI interviews And was able to make some of the information taken from the files public, helping to increase civil and political pressure to make Nixon and his people accountable
 unka iraadaa kuch or nahin balki nicksan white house or raajaneenic kaarnon se beuro main pherbadal karne ke unke prayaason kii ninda karnaa tha
 " 1980 main, swayan felt vedarman ke sandigdhon ke gharon main or unke pariwaron main gaiyrkanoonee sendhamari kaa aadesh dene kaa doshi paaya gaya
 Richard Nixon testified on his behalf
 raashtrapati ronaald reagan ne felt ko maaf kar diya or is baad main aparaadh ko record se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Felt's revelation is "I was the man they used to call deep throat" and to some extent the reason historians and other scholars have been so hard at identifying the actual deep throat, before Wood Ward's confirmation, is because No one seemed to fit correctly according to the character described in All the President's Man
 yahi vajah thi ki kuch vidwaan or tippaneekar is nishkarsh par pahunche the ki deep throt sambhawatah ek vyakti nahin ho saktaa or use kai sroton kaa ek samgr swaroop hona chahie
 From a literary business point of view, the theory was supported by an agent who originally marketed drafts of All the President's Man, who stated that the book's early typescript contained no reference to deep throat at all
 usne in atakalon ko janm diya kii woodward or bernastine ne sanghanit itihaas kii bhoomika usee tarah nibhaai jaise hollywood ke patakatha lekhak karte hai: lekhak dekhtaa he ki bade-bade kaam karne vaale asal jindagi ke nayak ke darjanon madadgaar hote hai, jo kul milakar unhen ek vyakti bana detaa he or use ek kaalpanik naam de detaa he
 This theory was originally thought to be based on Felt's claim of being deep-throated
 haalanki, epabiai kii jaanch-padtaal sambandhi filon ke haal hi ke adhyayan, woodward dwaara deep throt ke saath apni mulakaaton jari kiye gaye note or ol da presidents main main deep throt se sambandhit baatcheet ne yah khulaasa kiya tha ki felt ne sambhawatah deep throt se sambandhit sabhi jaankariyaan woodward ko nahin bataayi hongi
 In particular, in his investigation of Woodward's notes on Deep Throat, Ed Gray quotes these comments as stating Deep Throat "mitchell himself investigated for ten days and 'he went mad' Was going --- we even handed them some people to help '
 " grey dhyaan dilaate hai ki agar vah strot "


mark felt tha, uske 'ham' kaa matlab keval epabiai ho saktaa he
 But certainly no FBI agent was appointed immediately after the burglary to conduct an internal creep investigation of its own employees, the result of which was exactly what Mitchell and Creep wanted to keep away from the FBI
 agar vahaan "madad ke liye niyukt" epabiai agent hote jinhen "sabhi tarah kii nayi chijen mili thim," naa keval waterget maamla un pehle das dinon main ujagar ho gaya hota balki epabiai kii filein bhi parinami saakshatkaaron ke epady-302 se bhari hotin
 vahaan koi bhi maujuud nahin he
 " grey waterget kaal ke dauraan nyaay vibhaag ke ek adhikari, donald santareli ke saath hui ek baatcheet kaa bhi ek uddhran dete hai, jisamen grey woodwards kii kuch tippaniyon kii samagriyon ke bare main ullekh karte hai ki ve deep throt se sambandhit the
 In response Santarelli allegedly told Gray, "it was definitely me
 bob mujhe niyamit rup se kol kiya karte the or mujhase is tarah kii saamagree ke liye kehete the
 He further states that "deep Throat is still an overall 


 It wasn't just Mark Felt
 " Another prominent figure was White House Associate Counsel Fred F
 Were Fielding
 april 2003 main fielding ko illinois vishvavidhyalay ke patrakarita skool main ek kaksha ke bhaag ke rup main wiliam gains or unke patrakarita ke chaatro dwaara strot saamagree kii ek vistrut samiksha ke parinaam swaroop ek sambhavit ummidavaar banaakar prastut kiya gaya
 Fielding was an assistant to John Dean and thus had access to files related to the case
 gains ne mahasoos kiya ki woodward ke bayanon ne 'deep throt' ke epabiai main hone se inkaar kiya tha or yah ki "deep throt" ke paas jaankaree aksar epabiai se pehle aa jaati thi
 H
R
 Haldeman himself suspected Fielding's "deep throat"
 dean "deep throt" ke sabase samarpit shikariyon main se ek rahe the
 Both he and Leonard Garment had dismissed Fielding as a possibility, stating that he had made it clear by Woodward in 1980 when Fielding was applying for an important position in the Ronald Reagan administration
 haalanki fielding kii ore se kiye gaye is daawey kii pushti nahin kii gayi he
 One reason many experts believed that "deep throat" was fielding, not Felt, was because of Woodward's apparent denial in an interview that "deep throat" worked in an intelligence community: peeche mudakar dekhen to aisa lagata he ki woodward apane bayaan se keval videshi khufia agenciyon ko alag kar rahe the, naa ki epabiai ko
 Any candidate dead prior to Felt's acceptance did not fit Woodwood's criteria at the time, as Woodward stated that they were free to reveal their identity after "deep Throat" had died
 vishesh rup se yah ullekh kabhi nahin kiya gaya he ki kya unka iraadaa waterget ke usee deep throt ko dikhaane kaa tha

 On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services: first, fast and slow broadband lane permits, thereby compromising net neutrality; And second, broadband is replicated as a telecommunications service, thereby preserving net neutrality

 The story of the eighth effigy Pushpavati is as follows- King Vikramaditya was a wonderful art-connoisseur
 unhen shreshth kalakritiyon se apane mahal ko sajaane kaa shauk tha
 They used to assess the value of the artifacts and used to give a price to the seller
 ek din ve apane darbariyon ke bich baithe the ki kisi ne khabar di ki ek aadmi kaath kaa ghoda bechnaa chahta he
 The king wanted to see what was the specialty of that wooden horse
 naukar ke saath vah aadmi darbar main aayaa
 He brought with him a wooden horse whose workmanship was seen
 ekadam jivit maaloom padataa tha
 It was known only after careful examination that it was wooden
 vikram ne us aadmi se ghode kii visheshtaon ke bare main poocha
 The man replied that that horse could roam in water, land and sky at a very fast speed
 uske daam ke bare main poochne par usne bataaya ki yah uski jivan bhar kii mehnat kaa fal he, isliye vah ek lakh swarnamudraon se kam main use nahin bechega
 The king got his word and bought the horse by giving him one lakh gold coins
 phir vah aadmi khule maidan main aakar ghode ko uthaakar dikhaane laga tathaa uske kal-pujasç ke bare main sab kuch bataane laga
 Understanding all his methods of operation, Vikram kept the horse in his ashwagara
 ek din apane aadamiyon ke saath raja shikaar ko nikle to khud usee ghode par savaar the
 On suppressing kal-puja ç, his speed increased so much that the king enjoyed it
 ve bhul gaye ki akhet ke liye ve akele nahin nikle hai
 They came very far after being separated from their team
 unhone use hawa main udaane ke liye duusare kal-pujasç ko dabaaya
 His speed increased so much in the air that it was difficult for the king to handle him
 unhone use zamin par utaarna chaha to vah usee gati se utraa or ek ghaney ped kii shakhaon se takaraa kar tukade-tukade ho gaya
 Now the king was alone in that uninhabited and unknown place
 ve idhar-udhar bhatak rahe the tabhi saamne ek bandariyaa kudi or apane haav-bhav se kuch bataane kii koshish karne lagi
 By the time the king could understand something, neither of them fell on a hut
 raja ko bhukh lagi thi or ve thake bhi the
 They broke the fruits laden on the trees and satiated their hunger and climbed a tree and lay down
 ve vishram kar hi rahe the ki ek sanyasi aayaa or bandariyaa ko ishaara karke apane saath kutiyaa main rakhe do ghadon ke bich main bandariyaa ko baithne ko kaha
 He then splashed over the monkey with a pitcher full of water
 bandariyaa ek atyant rupavati rajkumaari ban gai
 He cooked food for the monk and when the monk ate, he pressed his hands and feet and the monk slept comfortably
 jab subah hui to sanyasi ne duusare ghade se chullu bhar pani lekar rajkumaari par chhinte maare
 The princess again became a monkey
 use lekar sanyasi kutiyaa se baahar aayaa or use van main swatantra vicharne ko chhodkar vahiin chalaa gaya
 After he left, Vikram came to the hut with the banister and sprinkled it on the monkey with water from the pitcher
 bandariyaa phir se anindya sundari ban gai
 As soon as she became a princess, she told the king that she was the child of Cupid and an Apsara
 "ek baar maine shikaar khelte hue ek wan mrug kii ore nishaanaa lagaakar choda
 He pierced the arm of a monk, not wearing a deer
 dard se karahate hue us sadhu ne mujhe shraap diya ki bandariyaa banakar mujhe sadhu kii seva kerani padegi
 When i cried and cried out that all this happened unknowingly, she sweatily told me the way to get rid of the curse
 usne kaha ki raja vikramaditya aakar tumhen shraap se mukti dilaayenge tathaa tumhaara patni ke rup main varan karenge agar vah sadhu tumhen koi chiz uphaar swarup degaa
 "I recognized you on seeing you
 ab sadhu ke lautne par main usase uphaar maangugi or aap meraa patni ke rup main varan karenge
 "vikram then spilled water and made him a monkey
 sadhu aayaa or usne bandariyaa se use rajkumaari main badal daalaa
 The princess asks him to give her a gift
 usne hawa main haath laharaaya to uske haath main khilaa hua camel aa gaya
 He said that this lotus will give you a gem every day
 sadhu ne yah bhi kaha ki use pataa he raja vikramaditya uski zindagi main aa pahunche hai, isliye vah rajkumaari ko baaki kii zindagi sukhpurvak vyateet karne kaa aashirwad detaa he
 The monk then happily sent the princess away from her hut
 rajkumaari ab puri tarah shaap mukt ho gai thi
 Vikram then recalled both the belts, which brought them both to the city limits and disappeared
 nagar main jab unhone pravesh kiya to ek baccha camel ke pushp ko praapt karne ko machal uthaa
 Vikram immediately satisfied with giving the lotus flower to the child
 phir mahal pahunchakar rajkaaj dekhne lage
 a few days later a poor man was caught by them
 use bahumoolya ratna bechney ke aarope main bandi banaaya gaya tha
 On being asked by the king, he told that someone had given a feeding lotus to his child, he has received these gems from the same lotus
 vikram ne sipaahiyon ko bina karan kisi kii eemaandaaree par shaq karne ke liye daanta tathaa ve saare ratna achche mulya par swayan kharid liye
 The man, giving prayers to the king, was satisfied and left the court

 An embedded system is a computer system, often designed to perform one or a few dedicated tasks with the constraints of real-time computing
 yah puure upkaran ke ek bhaag main ambeded hota he, jisamen aksar hardware tathaa yantric bhaag shaamil hote hai
 In contrast, a general-purpose computer, such as a personal computer, is designed to be flexible and to meet a wide range of end-user needs
 ambeded system vartmaan main prayog kiye jane vaale anek upkarnon ko niyantrit karte hai
 Embedded systems are controlled by one or more components of the main processing, typically a microcontroller or a digital signal processor
 haalanki isaki mukhya visheshta kisi ek vishisht kaary ko sanbhaalane ke liye samarpit hona he, jisamen atyadhik shaktishaalee processors kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 For example, it may be useful to view air traffic control systems as embedded, although they include mainframe computers and regional and national dedicated networks between airports and radar locations
 chunki ambeded system vishisht kaaryon ke prati samarpit hota he, atah dizin ejiniers, utpaada ke aakaar va laagat ko ghataakar tathaa vishwasaneeyata evam pradarshan ko badhaakar ise adhik upyogi bana sakate hai
 Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale
 bhautik rup se, ambeded system, vahneey upkarnon, jaise digital ghadiyon tathaa MP3 players, se lekar badi sthir sansthapanaaon, jaise yatayaat battiyon, kaarkaanon ke niyantrakon athwa parmaanu urja kendron, tak kii shrenee main hote hai
 The level of complexity ranges from low complexity for a single microcontroller chip to high complexity for multiple units, devices, and networks in a large structure or enclosure
 saamanyat: "ambeded system" shabdaawalee kii koi sateek paribhaasha nahin di ja sakati kyonki adhikansh systams main vistaaran athwa programing kii kshamta ke kuch tatva bhi shaamil hote hai
 For example, hand-held computers share some of their elements, such as operating systems and microprocessors that power them, with embedded systems, but they also allow other applications to load and connect devices
 iske alaava, yahaan tak ki jo systams programing kii kshamta ko apni praathmik visheshta ke rup main pradarshit nahin karte, unhen bhi software adyatanon kaa samarthan karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Moving from "general purpose" to "embedded" in an abysmal order, large applications will have some sub-components in most locations, even if the entire system is "built to accomplish one or a few dedicated tasks" and Thus it is appropriate to call it "embedded"
 ambeded systams kaa vistaar aadhunik jivan ke sabhi pahaluon tak he or unke prayog ke anek udhaaharan uplabdh hai
 Telecommunication systems use various embedded systems, from telephone switches in their networks to end-user mobile phones
 computer netwarking main data kaa maarg-nirdhaaran karne ke liye samarpit routers tathaa network brij kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Consumer electronics include personal digital assistants, mp3 players, mobile phones, videogame consoles, digital cameras, DVD players, GPS receivers and printers

 Reducing the cost of microprocessors and microcontrollers made it possible to use microprocessor-read up / down buttons or knobs in some consumer products in place of knob-based expensive analog components, such as potentiometers and variable capacitors
 1980 ke dashak ke madhya tak, purvavarti adhikansh saamaanya bahari system ghatakon ko procesar kii chip main hi ekikrut kar diya gaya tha or microcontrolrs ke is aadhunik rup ne or adhik vyapak prayog kii anumati di, jo dashak ke ant tak lagbhag sabhi electronics upkarnon ke liye apwaad na rah kar maanak ban gaye the
 In applications for which embedded systems are used, the integration of microcontrollers further increased areas that would not have traditionally been thought of using a computer
 ek saamaanya-uddeshy or apekshaakrit kam laagat vaale microcontrolar ko aksar anek pruthak ghatakon dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary ko karne ke liye program kiya ja saktaa he
 However, in this context, embedded systems are more complex than a traditional solution, with most of the complexity inherent in the automatic microcontroller itself
 bahut kam atirikt ghatakon kii aavashyaktaa hogi or adhikansh dizin prayaas software main shaamil hote hai
 The software's intangible nature makes it much easier to build prototypes and test new repeats than to create and build new circuits that do not use embedded processors

 Most of the structures are available with many different versions and sizes and many of them are also produced by different companies
 saamaanya sanrachanaon kii ek lambii, lekin abhi bhi apurna suchi he: 65816, 65C02, 68HC08, 68HC11, 68k, 8051, ARM, AVR, AVR32, Blackfin, C167, Coldfire, COP8, Cortus APS3, ez8, ez80, FR-V, H8, HT48, M16C, M32C, MIPS, MSP430, PIC, powerpc, R8C, SHARC, ST6, superh, TLCS-47, TLCS-870, TLCS-900, Tricore, V850, x86, XE8000, Z80, asap aadi
 PC / 104 and PC / 104 + are examples of standards for pre-built computer boards intended for small, small amounts of embedded and robust, mostly x86-based, systems
 aksar ye DOS, ]], netbsd yaa kisi ambeded real-time oparating system, jaise microc / OS-II, QNX yaa vxworks, kaa prayog karte hai
 Sometimes these boards also use non-x86 processors

 Some boards, such as the VIA EPIA category, are pc-compatible but highly integrated, helping to overcome this shortcoming by being physically small, or have characteristics that attract embedded engineers
 is paddati kaa laabh yah he ki saamaanya software vikaas ke liye prayukt software vikaas upkarnon ke saath kam-laagat saamagree vaale ghatakon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Systems thus created are also considered embedded because they are integrated into larger devices and serve a single role
 atms tathaa arched mashine, jinamein anuprayog ke liye vishisht code hota he, is paddati kaa prayog karne vaale upkarnon ke udhaaharan ho sakate hai
 However, most pre-built embedded systems boards are not pc-centric and do not use ISA or PCI buses
 When a system-on-a-chip processor is involved, there may be some benefit from having a standard bus connecting separate components and the environment can be very different for both hardware and software devices
 ek saamaanya dizin style ek chote, shaayad ek vyapaarik card ke aakaar ke, system modul, ucch ghanatv vaali BGA chips, jaise arm-aadhaarit ek system-on-a-chip procesar tathaa bahya upkaran, bhandaaran ke liye bahari flash memory tathaa rantime memory ke liye DRAM kaa prayog karti he

 socs can be implemented as an application-specific integrated circuit or by using a field-programmable gate array
 ambeded systams, paridhiy upkarnon ke madhyam se bahari vishwa se sampark karte hai, jaise: Like other softwares, embedded system designers also use compilers, assemblers and debuggers to develop embedded system software
 haalanki, ve kuch adhik vishisht upkarnon kaa prayog bhi kar sakate hai
 Software tools can come from various sources: jaise-jaise ambeded systams kii jatilta bad rahi he, ucch-stareey upkaran or oparating systams us mashinari main sthanantarit ho rahe hai, jahaan unka hona arth-purna hota he
 For example, cell phones, personal digital assistants and other consumer computers often require symptomatic software that is purchased or provided by someone other than the manufacturer of electronics
 aise tantron main, ek mukt programing vaataavaran, jaise: ]], netbsd, osgi athwa ambeded java, kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki third-party software pradaata inhen ek bade bazaar ko bech sake
 Embedded debugging can be done at different levels depending on the features available
 saralatam se sarvaadhik parishkrut tak, mote taur par unhen nimnlikhit kshetron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he: Unless external debugging is prohibited, the programmer can typically load and run software by devices, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop the task
 code ko asembli code yaa strot-code ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Since an embedded system is often made up of different types of elements, the debugging strategy can also vary
 udahaaran ke liye, kisi software- kendrit ambeded system kii dibging kisi aise ambeded system kii dibging se bhinn hoti he, jahaan adhikansh processing paridhiy upkarnon dwaara kii jaati he
 The number of embedded systems using more than one single processor core is continuously increasing
 software kriyanvayan kaa uchit sinchroniteeshan karnaa multi-kor vikaas ke saath ek saamaanya samasya he
 In such a situation, embedded system design may need to check the traffic of data on buses between processor cores, for which at the signal / bus level, e
g
 With a logic analyzer, very low-level debugging is required
 ambeded systams, aksar ansi mashiinon main hote hai, jinase kai varshon tak lagaataar trutiyon ke bina kaary karte rahane or truti utpann hone par kuch sthitiyon main khud hi usase ubarne kii ummid kii jaati he
 Therefore, software is often more carefully developed and tested than a personal computer and avoids the use of moving mechanical parts such as disk drives, switches and buttons, which are not reliable
 vishisht vishwasaneeyata muddon main shaamil ho sakate hai: a variety of techniques are sometimes used, sometimes in combination, to recover from errors — both software errors such as memory leaks as well as common hardware errors: ucch maatra vaale systams, jaise portable music players yaa mobile phone ke liye, laagat ko kam karnaa saamanyat: dizin ke dauraan praathmik vichaar hota he
 Engineers typically select hardware that is only "sufficient" to perform the necessary tasks
 programs ko simit karke yaa oparating system ko kisi real-time oparating system dwaara pratisthapit karke saamaanya uddeshy vaale computers ko nimna maatra vaale yaa prototip ambeded systams ke liye anukulit kiya ja saktaa he
 The use of various types of software structures is prevalent
 is dizin main, software main keval ek loop hota he
 This loop calls sub-routines, each of which manages a part of the hardware or software
 kuch ambeded systams mukhyat: interpt dwaara niyantrit kiye jate hai
 This means that the work done by the system is initiated by different types of events
 udaahranarth, ek purv-paribhaashit antaraal par kisi timer dwaara yaa ek bite praapt karne vaale kisi serial port niyantrak dwaara ek interpt utpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Such systems are used if event handlers require low-latency and event handlers are small and simple
 saamanyat: is prakaar ke systams ek mukhya loop main koi saral kaary bhi kriyanvit karte hai, lekin yah kaary anapekshit vilambon ke prati bahut adhik samvedansheel nahin hota
 Sometimes the interrupt handler will combine long functions into a line-structure
 baad main interpt handler kaa kaary samaapt ho jane par ye kaary mukhya loop dwaara kriyanvit kiye jate hai
 This method moves the system closer to a multi-tasking kernel with discrete processes
 ek non-priemptive multi tasking system bhi ek saral niyantran loop yojana ke samaan hi hota he, antar keval itnaa he ki loop ek API main chipa hota he
 The programmer defines a series of tasks, and each task inherits its own environment, in which it is "executed"
 jab koi kaary niskriy hota he, to vah ek niskriy routine ko kol karata he, jise saamanyat: "pause", "wait", "yield", "nop" aadi kaha jaataa he
 Its advantages and disadvantages are the same as in the control loop, the only difference being that adding new software is simple, only a new function is written or it is added to the Q-interpreter
 is prakaar ke system main code kaa ek nimna-stareey bhaag ek timer ke aadhaar par kaaryon yaa threads ke bich aadan-pradaan karata rahata he
 At this stage it is generally assumed that an "operating kernel" is present in the system
 kitni kaaryaatmakataa kii aavashyaktaa he, is par nirbhar karte hue, yah avadharanatmak rup se samanaantar sthiti main kriyanvit ho rahe anek kaaryon ke prabandhan ke liye adhik yaa kam jatiltaayen prastut karata he
 Since any code can potentially damage data from another function, programs must be carefully designed and tested, and control of the shared data through a synchronization strategy, such as message-line, semaphore, or any non Non-obstructive synchronization must be done by the scheme
 in jatiltaaon ke kaaran, sanghathanon dwaara ek real-time oparating system ko khareednaa ek saamaanya baat he, jo anuprayog programmers ko, kam-se-kam bade systams ke liye, oparating system sevaaon kii bajaay upkarnon kii kaaryaatmakataa par dhyaan kendrit karne kii anumati detaa he; memory aakaar, pradarshan tathaa / yaa bydaree jivan-kaal aadi kii simaaon ke kaaran chote systams ek saamaanya real-time system se jude atirikt kharch ko vahan nahin kar sakate
 a microkernel is logically the next stage of a real-time OS
 saamaanya vyavastha yah he ki oparating system karnal memory aavantit karata he or kriyanvan ke vibhinn threads par CPU kaa aadan-pradaan karata he
 User mode processes implement core functions, such as file systems, network interfaces, etc
 saamaanya rup main, microkarnal tab safal hote hai, jab kaaryon kaa aadan-pradaan tathaa kaaryon ke bich samvaad teevr ho or tab asafal hote hai, jab ye dhime hon
 Exocarnals communicate efficiently through common subroutine calls
 hardware or system main upasthit sampoorn software, anuprayog programmers ke liye uplabdh or unke dwaara vitanya hota he
 In this situation, a relatively large kernel with sophisticated capabilities is adapted to conform to the embedded environment
 yah programmers ko ]] yaa ]] jaise ek desktop oparating system ke samaan vaataavaran pradaan karata he or isliye vikaas ke liye bahut utpaadak hota he; duusari ore ise lakshaneey rup se adhik maatra main hardware sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, yah adhik mahangaa hota he or in karnal kii jatilta ke kaaran kam anumaan-yogya or kam vishwasaneey hota he
 ]] And]] are common examples of embedded monolithic kernels

 Some reasons for this are: ambeded systams ke ek chote bhaag ko surakshit, samayik, vishwasaneey yaa daksh vyavhaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise uparokt main se kisi ek sanrachana dwaara praapt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 ansi sthiti main sanghathan ek upyukt system kaa nirmaan karata he
 In some cases, using special techniques, the system can be divided into a "performance controller" and a "display controller" with a traditional operating system
 ek samvaad tantra donon ke bich data kaa aadan-pradaan karata he
 In addition to the basic operating system, many embedded systems have high-layer additional software components
 in ghatakon main CAN, TCP / IP, FTP, HTTP tathaa HTTPS jaise protocol stack hote hai or inamen FAT or flash memory prabandhan system jaisi bhandaaran kshamtaayen bhi shaamil hoti hai
 If the embedded device has audio and video capabilities, then appropriate drivers and codecs will be present in the system

 For example, Derrick Lodrick states, "eating beef is common among low-caste Hindus", and vegetarianism is an upper-caste phenomenon

 The epic text of this epic is Valmikkrit Ramayana
 mahakavy main chaar kand hai
 From the point of view of the story of the story, this epic is divided into 22 circles and is coordinated with the overall characteristics of the epic
 rachana kaa mukhya uddeshy vyakaran evam sahitya ke lakshanon ko lakshya dwaara upasthit karne kaa he
 This epic is divided into four kandas in order to present the symptoms by the target, in which three kandas serve the purpose of the author by using various word forms according to Sanskrit grammar
 madhya main ek cond kavyasaushthav ke katipay angon ko abhilakshith kar rachaa gaya he
 The sequence of composition is such that the first case grammatically stores a wide variety of word forms
 dwitiya cond 'adhikaar cond' he jisamen panineey vyakaran ke katipay vishisht adhikaron main pradarshit niyamon ke anusaar shabdaprayog he
 The third episode has been designed with a view to reflecting literary characteristics, hence Mahakavi has termed this incident as 'prasad Kand'
 is cond main chaar adhikaran hai : pratham adhikaran main shabdalankar evam arthalankar ke lakshya hai
 In the second tribunal, the nature of the virtue has been demonstrated by the target, in the third tribunal, while displaying the nature of emotionality, highlights various elements and measures of politics according to the theme of the plot
 prasann cond kaa chauthaa adhikaran is mahakavy kaa ek vishesh rup he
 It contains such verses that have parallel incorporation of Sanskrit and Prakrit language, the same verse is sub-stitched in Sanskrit, whose verse is also the same form of Prakrit verse and both languages have the same prophetic meaning
 bhashaa sam kaa udhaaharan prastut karata hua yah ansh bhattikavy kii nijee visheshta he
 The last episode again demonstrates the varied word form of the trinity, a complex form of Sanskrit grammar
 yah cond sabase bada he
 Symptomatic, in terms of the division of the Kathaavastu in these four scandals, the first five cantos are described in which the undertaking of Ramjanma, Sita Vivaha, Rama's Vanagman and Sitaharan and Rama's seeding are described respectively
 dwitiya cond agle chaar sargo ko vyaapt karata he jisamen sugriv kaa rajbhishek, vanar bhaton dwaara sita kii khoj, laut aane par ashokavatika kaa bhang or maaruti ko pakadakar sabha main upasthit kiye jane kii kathavstu varnit he
 Thirdly, there are the next four cantos in Prasannakand which include the performance of Sita's cognition, the description of Prabhat in Lanka, the story of Vibhishana's arrival with Rama and the story of the bridge
 antim, tisaint cond agle nau sarg le letaa he jinamein sharbandh se lagaakar raja ramchandra ke ayodhya laut aane tak kaa kathabhag varnit he
 There are 1625 verses in four episodes and 22 sergoes, of which the first verse Mangalacharan is objective and the last verse is of poetry
 1625 padyasankhya ke is mahakavy main adhikansh prayog anushtubh shlokon kaa he jinamein sarg chah, nau tathaa 14 vaan evam 12 vaan
 In the tenth canto various verses have been used of which Puppitagra is prominent

 From the point of view of literature, there is mainly ozoguna and gauri ritual in Bhattikavya, however other Madhuryadi qualities and Vaidarbhi and Lahti rituals are also available in sufficient quantity
 swayan praneta ke anusaar bhattikavy kii rachana gurjar desh ke antargat balbhi nagar main hui
 The name of the poet Bhatti is an abrasive form of the word "bhartru"
 katipay sameekshak kavi kaa puraa naam bhartruhari maanate hai, parantu yah bhartruhari nishchit hi shatakatray ke nirmaataa athwa vaakyapadiya ke praneta bhartruhari se bhinn hai
 The Bhatti surname is related to Bhartrihari poet Valbhiranesh Sridhar Sen
 mahakavi bhatti kaa samay isvi chhathi shatabdi kaa uttarardh sarvasammat he
 The examples indicated in the Alankara class show that Bhatti and Bhamah are followers of the same tradition
 bhattikavy kii rachana ke purv lagbhag 10 shatabdiyon tak panini kaa ashtaadhi kaa hi gahan pathan-pathan hota aa rahaa tha
 Bhatti's aim was to create a tool that would make Ashtadhyayi's study easier
 aisa unhone pehle se maujuud vyakaran ke bhashyagranthon main die gayi udaahranon ko ramakatha ke saath sambaddh karke kiya
 This led to simplicity and simplicity in learning

 shivaji maharaj kaa janm 19 farvari 1630 main shivneri durg main hua tha
 Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630 in Shivneri fort with the womb of Jijabai, wife of Shahji Bhonsle

 His childhood was spent under the guidance of his mother Jijau Maa Saheb
 vah sabhi kalaon main maahir the, unhone bachapan main raajnneeti evam yuddh kii shiksha lee thi
 These belonged to the Bhonsle sub-caste who were originally from the Kshatriya Maratha caste
 gagabhatta ke anusaar shivaji kaa vansh mewar ke prasiddh guhil sisodiya vansh se miltaa he
 It is due to Shivaji that the entire Maratha community has got the status of being a Kshatriya
 unke pita apratim shoorveer the or unki duusari patni tukabai mohite thim
 His mother Jijabai Jadhav was an extraordinary genius born in the clan and his father was a powerful feudal
 shivaji maharaj ke charitra par mata-pita kaa bahut prabhaav padaa
 Right from childhood, he began to understand the atmosphere and events of that era
 shaasha varg kii karatuuton par ve jhallaate the or baichaiyn ho jate the
 The flame of freedom was ignited in his child's heart
 unhone kuch swamibhakt saathiyon kaa sanghathan kiya
 As the situation progressed, his resolve to break the shackles of foreign rule became stronger
 chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa vivaah san 14 may 1640 main saibai nimbalkar ke saath laal mahal, puna main hua tha
 At that time the kingdom of Bijapur was going through a period of mutual struggle and foreign invasion
 aise samrajya ke sultan kii seva karne ke badale unhone maawalon ko bijapur ke kilaaf sangathit karne lage
 Maval Pradesh is connected to the Western Ghats and is some 150 km long and 30 km wide
 ve sangharmpurn jivan vyateet karne ke kaaran kushal yoddha maane jate hai
 Marathas and people of all castes live in this region
 shivaji maharaj in sabhi jati ke logon ko lekar maawalon naam dekar sabhi ko sangathit kiya or unase sampark kar unke pradesh se parichit ho gaye the
 He had started the construction of the fort by bringing Maval youths
 maawalon kaa sahyog shivaji maharaj ke liye baad main utana hi mahatvapurn sabit hua jitna shershah suri ke liye afagaanon kaa saath
 At that time Bijapur was troubled by mutual struggle and Mughal invasion
 bijapur ke sultan adilshaah ne bahut se durgon se apni sena hataakar unhen sthaneey shaskaon yaa samanton ke haath saunp diya tha
 When Adilshah fell ill, anarchy spread in Bijapur and Shivaji Maharaj took advantage of the opportunity and decided to enter Bijapur
 shivaji maharaj ne iske baad ke dinon main bijapur ke durgon par adhikaar karne kii niti apanaai
 The first fort was the fort of Toran
 torana kaa durg puna ke dakshin pashchim main 30 kilometre kii duuri par tha
 Shivaji sent his envoy to Sultan Adilshah and informed him that he was ready to pay better money than the first fortress and handed over this area to him
 unhone adilshaah ke darbariyon ko pehle hi rishwat dekar apane paksh main kar liya tha or apane darbariyon kii salaah ke mutabik adilshaah ne shivaji maharaj ko us durg kaa adhipati bana diya
 Shivaji Maharaj got the work done to repair the deficiencies of the fort with the property found in that fort
 isse koi 10 kilometre dur rajgad kaa durg tha or shivaji maharaj ne is durg par bhi adhikaar kar liya
 When Adilshah got the idea of shivaji Maharaj's policy of expanding this empire, he was upset
 usne shahji raaje ko apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha
 Shivaji Maharaj, regardless of his father, took over the management of his father's territory in his hands and stopped regular renting
 rajgad ke baad unhone chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar liya or uske baad kondana ke durg par
 While taking possession of Kondana, he had to bribe
 usake baad aurangzeb ne mirzaraja jaisingh ko bhejkar 23 kilon par kabja kiya baad main shiji maharaj ke mawala tanaji malusre ne kondhana durg par kabja kiya par us yuddh main vah viragati ko praapt hua uski yaad main kondana par adhikaar karne ke baad uskaa naam singhgarh rakhaa gaya
 Shahaji Raje was given the title of Poona and Soupa and the fortress of Soupa was in the hands of his relative Baji Mohite
 shivaji maharaj ne raat ke samay soopa ke durg par akraman karke durg par adhikaar kar liya or baaji mohite ko shahji raaje ke paas karnataka bhej diya
 Some part of his army also came in the service of Shivaji Maharaj
 isi samay purandar ke kiledaar kii mrityu ho gai or kile ke uttaradhikaar ke liye uske teenon beton main ladaai chhid gai
 Shivaji Maharaj reached Purandar on the invitation of two brothers and, taking recourse to diplomacy, he imprisoned all the brothers
 is tarah purandar ke kile par bhi unka adhikaar sthapit ho gaya
 In the event so far, Shivaji Maharaj did not have to do any war or bloodshed
 1647 isvi tak ve chaakan se lekar nira tak ke bhubhag ke bhi adhipati ban chuke the
 With his increased military power, Shivaji Maharaj planned to enter the plains
 ek ashwarohi sena kaa gathan kar shivaji maharaj ne aabaaji sonder ke netritv main konkan ke viruddh ek sena bheji
 Abaji captured nine other fortifications including Konkan
 iske alaava taala, mosmala or raiti ke durg bhi shivaji maharaj ke adheen aa gaye the
 All the property looted was kept safe in Raigad
 kalyaan ke governor ko mukt kar shivaji maharaj ne kolaba kii ore rukh kiya or yahan ke pramukhon ko videshiyon ke kilaaf yuddh ke liye uksaaya
 Sultan of Bijapur was already in a rage before Shivaji Maharaj's antics
 usne shivaji maharaj ke pita ko bandi banane kaa aadesh de diya
 Shahaji Raje was in Karnataka at the time and was taken prisoner by a treacherous assistant Baji Ghorpade and brought to Bijapur
 un par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone qutubashah kii seva praapt karne kii koshish kii thi jo golconda kaa shaasha tha or is kaaran adilshaah kaa shatru
 After the mediation of two chieftains of Bijapur, Shahaji Maharaj was freed on the condition that he would control Shivaji Maharaj
 agle chaar varshon tak shivaji maharaj ne bijipur ke kilaaf koi akraman nahin kiya
 During this time he organized his army
 shahji kii mukti kii sharton ke mutabik shivaji rajane bijapur ke kshetron par akraman to nahin kiya par unhone dakshin-pashchim main apni shakti badhaane kii cheshtaa kii
 But in this order the state of Javali was acting as a hindrance
 yah rajya satara ke sudur uttar pashchim main vama or krishna nadi ke bich main sthit tha
 The king here was Chandrarao More, who received this manor from Shivaji
 shivaji ne more shaasha chandrarav ko swaraj main shamil hone ko kaha par chandrarav bijapur ke sultan ke saath mil gaya
 In 1656, Shivaji attacked Javali with his army
 chandrarav more or uske donon putron ne shivaji ke saath ladaai kii par ant main ve bandi bana liye gaye par chandrarav bhaag gaya
 The local people opposed this act of Shivaji but they succeeded in crushing the rebellion
 isse shivaji ko us durg main sangrahit aath vanshon kii sampatti mil gai
 Apart from this, many Maval soldiers Murarabaji Deshpande also joined Shivaji's army
 shivaji ke bijapur tathaa mughal donon shatru the
 At that time, Shahzada Aurangzeb was the Subedar of Deccan
 isi samay 1 navambar 1656 ko bijapur ke sultan adilshaah kii mrityu ho gai jiske baad bijapur main araajaktaa kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 Taking advantage of this situation, Aurangzeb invaded Bijapur and Shivaji attacked him instead of supporting Aurangzeb
 unki sena ne junnar nagar par akraman kar dher sari sampatti ke saath 200 ghode lut liye
 Apart from 700 horses, four elephants from Ahmednagar, they looted the fort of Gunda and Resin
 iske parinamswaroop aurangzeb shivaji se khafaa ho gaya or maitri vaarta samaapt ho gai
 On the orders of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb made a treaty with Bijapur and at the same time Shah Jahan fell ill
 uske vyaadhigrast hote hi aurangzeb uttar bharat chalaa gaya or vahaan shahjahan ko kaid karne ke baad mughal samrajya kaa shah ban gaya
 Knowing the absence of Aurangzeb in South India and the political situation in Bijapur, Shivaji asked Samarji to attack Janjira
 par zanjeera ke siddiyon ke saath unki ladaai kai dinon tak chali
 After this Shivaji himself invaded Janjira and took control of South Konkan and collected annual tax from the Portuguese of Daman
 kalyaan tathaa bhiwandi par adhikaar karne ke baad vahaan nausainik adda bana liya
 By this time, Shivaji had become the owner of 40 fortifications
 idhar aurangzeb ke agra laut jane ke baad bijapur ke sultan ne bhi raahat kii saans lee
 Now Shivaji was the most powerful enemy of Bijapur
 shahji ko pehle hi apane putr ko niyantran main rakhane ko kaha gaya tha par shahji ne isamen apni asamarthta jaahir kii
 The Sultan of Bijapur sent Abdullah Bhatari against Shivaji to deal with Shivaji
 afajal ne 12 xxrep 4 0 sainikon ke saath 1659 main kooch kiya
 Destroying the temples of Tuljapur, he came to Shiraval, 30 km north of Satara
 par shivaji pratapgarh ke durg par hi rahe
 Afzal Khan sent his envoy Krishnaji Bhaskar for a treaty
 usne uske marfat ye sandesh bhijwaya ki agar shivaji bijapur kii adheenta sweekaar kar le to sultan use un sabhi kshetron kaa adhikaar de denge jo shivaji ke niyantran main hai
 At the same time, Shivaji will receive an honored position in the court of Bijapur
 haalanki shivaji ke mantri or salaahkaar as sandhi ke paksh main the par shivaji ko ye vaarta raas nahin ai
 He gave proper respect to Krishnaji Bhaskar and placed it in his court and sent his messenger Gopinath to Afzal Khan to take stock of the situation
 gopinath or krishnaji bhaskar se shivaji ko aisa laga ki sandhi kaa shadyantra rachakar afjal khan shivaji ko bandi bananaa chahta he
 Therefore, he sent a valuable gift to Afzal Khan in exchange for war and thus persuaded Afzal Khan to negotiate
 sandhi sthal par donon ne apane sainik ghaat lagaakar rakhe the milane ke sthaan par jab donon mili tab afjal khan ne apane katyar se shivaji pe waar kiya bachaav main shivaji ne afjal khan ko apane vastron vaghankho se maar diya 
 After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji took control of the fort of Panhala
 iske baad pavangadh or vasantgarh ke durgon par adhikaar karne ke saath hi saath unhone rustam khan ke akraman ko vifal bhi kiya
 With this they also captured Rajapur and Dawul
 ab bijapur main aatank kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya or vahaan ke samanton ne aapasi matbhed bhulaakar shivaji par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 On 2 October 1665, the Bijapuri army captured the Panhala fort
 shivaji sankat main funs chuke the par raatri ke andhkaar kaa laabh uthaakar ve bhaagane main safal rahe
