 Konark Surya Mandir is revered in the city of Puri under Puri district of the state of Orissa in India
 yah bharatvarsh ke chuninda surya mandiron main se ek he
 In 1984, UNESCO has recognized it as a World Heritage Site
 yah mandir surya-dev arthath arq ko samarpit tha, jinhen sthaneey log biranchi-narayan kehete the
 For this reason, this region was called ark-kshetra or padma-kshetra
 puraanon ke anusaar shrikrishna ke putr samb ko unke shraap se kodh rog ho gaya tha
 Samb did penance for twelve years in Konark at the ocean confluence of the Chandrabhaga river at Mitravan and pleased the Sun God
 suryadev, jo sabhi rogon ke naashak the, ne iske rog kaa bhi nivaaran kar diya tha
 Accordingly, Samb decided to build a temple of the Sun God
 apane rog-naash ke uparaant, chandrabhaga nadi main snaan karte hue, use suryadev kii ek murti mili
 This idol was made by Devashilpi Sri Vishwakarma from the same part of Suryadev's body
 samb ne apane banawaaye mithravan main ek mandir main, is murti ko sthapit kiya, tab se yah sthaan pavitra mana jane laga
 It is the opinion of many historians that due to the premature death of King Langul Narsinghdeva, the builder of the Konark temple, the construction work of the temple fell into disrepair
 iske parinamswaroop, adhuraa dhaancha dhwast ho gaya
 But this view is not supported by historical figures
 puri ke madal panji ke aankadon ke anusaar or kuch 1278 i
 ke tamrapatron se pataa chalaa, ki raja langool nrisinghdev ne 1282 tak shashan kiya
 Many historians are also of the opinion that the Konark temple was built between 1253 to 1260 AD
 atev mandir ke apurna nirmaan kaa iske dhwast hone kaa kaaran hona tarksangat nahin he
 It is no less than a complex task to mention the entire reasons for the demolition of the temple here
 parantu yah sarvavidit he ki ab iskaa kaaphi bhaag dhwast ho chukaa he
 The main reason for this is also called Vastu Dosh, but the role of Muslim invasions has been important
 kaha jaataa he ki yah mandir apane vaastu dosha ke kaaran maatr 800 varshon main ksheen ho gaya tha
 Which is heard and heard against Vastu art and rules
 isi karanvash yah apni samyavadhi se pehle hi rugavedakaal evam pashaan kala kaa anupam udhaaharan hote hue bhi dharashayi ho gaya
 The main architectural defects of this Sun-temple are: -
 kai kathaon ke anusaar, surya mandir ke shikhar par ek chumbakeey pathar laga he
 As a result of this, the ocean ships passing through the sea of konark are drawn towards this, causing heavy damage to them
 anya katha anusaar, is pathar ke kaaran poton ke chumbakeey disha nirupan yantra sahi disha nahin bataate
 For this reason, Muslim sailors took out this stone to save their grandsons
 yah pathar ek kendriya shila kaa kaary kar rahaa tha, jisase mandir kii deevaaron ke sabhi pathar santulan main the
 Due to its removal, the balance of the temple walls was lost and as a result they collapsed
 parantu is ghatana kaa koi aitihaasik vivaran nahin miltaa, naa hi aise kisi chumbakeey kendriya pathar ke astitv kaa koi byora uplabdh he
 a very important theory related to the fall of Konark temple is associated with Kalapahad
 urisa ke itihaas ke anusaar kalapahaad ne san 1508 main yahaan akraman kiya or konark mandir samet urisa ke kai hindu mandir dhwast kar diye
 Madan Panji of the Jagannath temple in Puri tells how Kalapahar attacked Orissa
 konark mandir sahit usne adhikansh hindu mandiron kii pratimaayein bhi dhwast kareen
 Although it was impossible to break the 20-25 feet thick walls of the Konark temple, he somehow managed to shake Dadhinauti, which caused the temple to collapse
 dadhinauti ke hatane ke kaaran hi mandir dhire-dhire girane laga tathaa chat se baari pathar girane se, mukashaala kii chat bhi dhwast ho gayi
 He also demolished most of the sculptures here and many other temples in Konark
 san 1568 main urisa main muslimon kaa aatank niyantran main ho chukaa tha
 But even after this, there were continuous efforts to break the Hindu temples
 is samay puri ke jagannatha mandir ke pandon ne bhagwaan jagannatha ji kii murti ko shrimandir se hataakar kisi gupt sthaan par chupa diya tha
 Similarly, the pandas of the Sun Temple of Konark removed the idol of the presiding deity and kept it hidden in the sand for years
 baad main, yah murti puri bhej di gayi or vahaan jagannatha mandir ke praangan main sthit, indra ke mandir main rakh di gayi
 According to others, the worship idols here are still to be discovered
 lekin kai logon kaa kahana he, ki surya dev kii murti, jo nai dilli ke rashtriya sangrahalay main rakhi he, vahi konark kii pradhan poojya murti he
 Yet in Konark, Surya Vandana ceased after the removal of the idol from the temple
 is kaaran konark main tirthayatriyon kaa aana janaa band ho gaya
 Konark's port also closed due to bandits attack
 konark surya vandana ke samaan hi vanijyik gatividhiyon hetu bhi ek kirtivan nagar tha, parantu in gatividhiyon ke band ho jane ke kaaran, yah ekadam nirvasit ho chalaa or varshon tak ek gahan jangal se dhank gaya
 In 1626, the king of Khurda, Narasimha Dev, son Shri Purushottam Dev, took the idol of Suryadev to Puri along with two other statues of Surya and Chandra
 ab ve puri ke mandir ke praangan main milti hai
 It is known from the history of the Madal Register of Puri that in 1028, King Naseenhadeva ordered the measurement of all the temples of Konark
 maapan ke samay, surya mandir apni amalak shila tak astitv main tha, yani ki lagbhag 200 feet ooncha
 Kalapahad destroyed not only its urn, but also the padma-dhwaja, kamal-kirit and the upper part
 pehle bataaye anusaar, mukhshala ke saamne, ek bada prastar khand – navagraha paat, hota tha
 The then king of Khurda removed that block, as well as took a number of sculpted stones from Konark
 or puri ke mandir ke nirmaan main unka prayog kiya tha
 In the Maratha period, Konark stones were used in the construction of the boundary wall of the temple of Puri
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he, ki nat mandir ke sabhi bhaag, sabase lambe kaal tak, apni mul avasthaa main rahe hai
 And in the Maratha period, they were deliberately broken as an unusable part
 san 1779 main ek maratha sadhu ne konark ke arun stambh ko hataa kar puri ke singhdwar ke saamne sthapit karvaa diya
 By the end of the eighteenth century, Konark lost all its glory and turned into a forest
 iske saath hi mandir kaa kshetra bhi jangal ban gaya, jahaan junglee jaanavar or daakuon ke adde the
 The locals here were also afraid to go till daylight
 konark shabd, 'kone' or 'arq' shabdon ke mail se bana he
 The meaning of the extract is sun while the angle must have been from the corner or edge
 prastut konark surya-mandir kaa nirmaan laal rang ke balua pattharon tathaa kaale grenite ke pattharon se hua he
 It was built in 1236–1264 BC by the erstwhile feudal king of Ganga Dynasty, Narasimhadeva
 yah mandir, bharat ke sabase prasiddh sthalon main se ek he
 It has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984
 kaling style main nirmit is mandir main surya dev ko rath ke rup main virajman kiya gaya he tathaa pattharon ko utkrisht nakkashi ke saath ukera gaya he
 The entire temple site has been constructed with twelve pair of chakras pulled by seven horses, in which the sun god is shown seated
 parantu vartmaan main saaton main se ek hi ghoda bachaa hua he
 These twelve chakras define the twelve months of the year, giving beauty to the base of the temple and each chakra is made up of eight arrows, which represent the eight wheels of the day
 yahaan par sthaneey log prastut surya-bhagwaan ko biranchi-narayan kehete the
 The main temple is built in three pavilions
 inamen se do mandap dhah chuke hai
 In the third pavilion where the idol was, the British had filled the sand and stones before the Indian independence, and closed all the gates permanently so that the temple could not be damaged
 is mandir main surya bhagwaan kii teen pratimaayein hai: On its entry, two lions are shown to be aggressive in defense of elephants

 Brahma and Shiva are considered to be the other two forms of Trimurti
 brahma ko jahaan vishwa kaa srijan karne vaala mana jaataa he, vahiin shiv ko sanhaarak mana gaya he
 Originally Vishnu and Shiva and Brahma are also the same, this belief has also been generally accepted
 nyaay ko prashray, anyaay ke vinaash tathaa jeev ko paristhiti ke anusaar uchit maarg-grahan ke nirdesh hetu vibhinn roopon main avatar grahan karanevaale ke rup main vishnu maanya rahe hai
 According to the Puranas, Vishnu's wife is Lakshmi
 kaamdev vishnu ji kaa putr tha
 Vishnu's abode is Kshira Sagar
 unka shayan sheshnag ke upar he
 a lotus is produced from his navel in which Brahma ji is situated
 vah apane neeche vaale baayein haath main padam, apane neeche vaale daahine haath main gada ,upar vaale baayein haath main shankh or apane upar vaale daahine haath main chakra dhaaran karte hai
 The derivation of the word 'vishnu' has been considered mainly from the 'vishu' metal
 nirukt main yaskacharya ne mukhya rup se 'vish' dhaatu ko hi 'vyapti' ke arth main lete hue usase 'vishnu' shabd ko nishpann bataaya he
 Alternatively, 'vishwa Dhatu' is also taken to mean 'entry', 'because it is penetrated everywhere because of being an aspect
 aadi shankaracharya ne bhi apane vishnusahasranam-bhashya main 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth mukhyatah vyapak hi mana he, tathaa uski vyutpatti ke rup main spashtatah likhaa he ki "vyapti arth ke vaachak nuk pratyyant 'vish' dhaatu kaa rup 'vishnu' banataa he"
 He has also taken the 'vishwa Dhatu' option and wrote that "or the negative form of the 'vishva Dhatu' is Vishnu; as stated in Vishnupurana - 'the power of that Mahatma has entered this whole world
 ; Therefore he is called Vishnu, because ‘vish’ dhatu means to enter ”
 rugveda ke pramukh bhashyakaron ne bhi praayah ek swar se 'vishnu' shabd kaa arth vyapak hi kiya he
 In the interpretation of Vishnusukta, Acharya Saiyan means 'vishnu' is pervasive and omnipresent; So Shripad Damodar Satavalekar also takes its meaning related to the generality
 maharishi dayanand saraswati ne bhi 'vishnu' kaa arth anekatra sarvyaapee paramatma kiya he or kai jagah param vidvan ke arth main bhi liya he
 Thus it is clearly reflected that the word 'vishnu' is derived from 'vishu' metal and its meaning is vyapam
 vaidic dev-parampara main sookhton kii sankhyik drushti se vishnu kaa sthaan gaun he kyonki unka stvan maatr 5 sookhton main kiya gaya he; lekin yadi sankhyik drushti se na dekhakar unpar or pahaluon se vichaar kiya jaay to unka mahatva bahut badhkar saamne aata he
 In the Rigveda, he is read with adjectives like 'brihachhriar', Yuvakumar etc
 rugveda main ullikhit vishnu ke swaroop evam vaishishtyon kaa avlokan nimnanki binduon main kiya ja saktaa he :- The unique feature of Vishnu is his three foot-projections, which are mentioned twelve times in the Rigveda
 sambhavtah yah unki sabase badi visheshta he
 His three steps are said to be full of honey, which never diminishes
 unke teen pad-kram itane vistrut hai ki unamem sampoorn lok vidyaman rahete hai 
 'tredha Vichkramana' also transitions to three foot-projections
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad bhi ukt tathy ke parichaayak hai
 Out of his three rankings supplied with Madhu, two are visible, the third is completely imperceptible
 is tisare sarvocch pad ko pakshiyon kii udaan or martya chakshu ke us paar kaha gaya he
 Yask's predecessor Shakupani considers these three footprints to be the symbols of the Sun's movement in three parts of the Universe - Earth, Space and Duloka
 yask ke hi purvavarti aurnavabh unhen surya ke udai, madhyakash main sthiti tathaa ast kaa vaachi maanate hai
 Tilak Sir considers them as a sign of trifurcation of the year
 yadi dekha jaay to adhikansh vidvan vishnu ko surya-vaachi maan kar udaykaal se madhyahn paryant uskaa ek padprakshep, madhyahn se astkaal paryant dwitiya padprakshep or astkaal se punah agrim udaykaal tak tritiy paad-prakshep sweekaarte hai
 These aforesaid two foot projections have been called visible and the third one is unmarked
 lekin mcdanal sahit anya anek vidwaanon kaa bhi kahana he ki is arth main tisare charan ko 'sarvocch' kaise mana ja saktaa he? isliye ve log purvokt shakpuni kii tarah teen charnon ko saura devtaa ke teenon lokon main se hokar jane ke maarg ko maanate hai
 Supporting the idea of the Sun, mcdanal mentions the operation of his 90 horse by Vishnu, each of which has four names
 is prakaar 4 kii sankhya se gunikrut 90 arthath 360 ashwon ko ve ek saura varsh ke dinon se abhinn maanate hai
 In fact, the two terms of Vishnu indicate the control of the whole world and his attainment of the third post i
e
 His ultimate abode
 swayan rugveda main hi in teen padon kii rahasyatmak vyakhya kii gayi he
 Therefore, considering this verse as knowledgeable, it has been clearly stated in the Rigveda that the ultimate post of Vishnu is known only by the learned people
 vaise to vishnu ko vaani main nivas karne vaala bhi mana jaataa he, kintu unka param priy awaas sthal 'pathah' rugveda main bahucharchit he
 Acharya Sayan considered the term 'giri' to be a courtesy, along with its meaning 'vani', as well as figuratively 'advanced folk like a mountain'
 'giri' ko yadi in donon arthon main sweekrut kar liya jaay to samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jaataa he
 Where Vishnu reaches the third position is his place of residence
 vishnu kaa lok ‘param pad’ he arthath gantavya roopen vah sarvotkrisht lok he
 The specialty of that 'param pad' is that it is highly illuminated
 vahaan anek shringon vaali gaayen sancharan kiya karti hai
 'gavah' is like a courtesy here
 shlesh se uskaa arth ‘gaayen’ karne par vahaan dugdh aadi bhautik pushti kaa prachurya evam ‘kirane’ karne par vahaan prakaash arthath atmik unnati kaa bahulya sahaj hi anumey he
 The 'param Pad' of Vishnu has a permanent emanation of Madhu
 yah ‘madhu’ devataaon ko bhi anandit karanevaala he
 Whatever meaning is given to this elegant verse, but it is a sign of bliss in every situation, for which all the creatures including the deity are also desirous and are also trying
 isliye ukt lok kii prapti kii kaamana sabhi karte hai
 In the same mantra, there are also mentions of virtuous people there, while experiencing fulfillment
 vishnu kii ek pramukh visheshta unka indra se maitribhav he
 Indra's companionship enforces his three footsteps
 indra ke saath milakar vah shambar daitya ke 99 kilon kaa vinaash karte hai
 In the same way, he also helps Indra in the battle with vrittra
 donon ko kahin-kahin ek duusare kii shaktiyon se yukt bhi batalaaya gaya he
 Thus Sompan by Vishnu and three foot projections by Indra are also described
 rugveda, mandal 6, sookt 69 main donon devon kaa yugmaroopen stvan hua he
 Similarly, in the verse 5, Sukta 87 of the Rigveda, he gets his help with Indra's fellow Marudagans
 vish dhaatu se vyutpann vishnu pad kaa shabdic arth ‘vyapak, gatisheel, kriyasheel athwa udhyam-sheel’ hota he
 They are praised by the people due to their force and disorder
 ve anant veeryavale hai
 Due to this quality, he is also considered as ‘vrishna’ symbolically
 apane veery athwa vir karmon ke kaaran ve shatruon ke bhay kaa kaaran hai
 People are afraid of them in the same way as a mountain lion
 ‘parameshwaradbhitih’ aadi shruti-vachanon se saamaanya janon kaa bhi unase bhay karnaa siddh ho jaataa he
 Being afraid of them is not without reason
 ve kutsiton kaa vadh aadi hinsakarm karne vaale hai
 It is important to note here that they kill the snotty violent person
 isliye unke liye kaha gaya he ki ve hatyare nahin hai
 Vishnu is wide-ranging, broad and of unrestrained speed
 ‘urugay’ or ‘urukram’ aadi pad is tathy ke poshak hai
 The meaning of 'uruguay' is not even glorified by Acharya Sayan by 'mahajajans doing Stuyaman' or 'prabhutya Stuyaman'
 da
yadunandan mishra kaa kahana he ki is pad kaa arth ‘visteern gati vaala’ karne ke liye ham is liye aagrahvan hai, kyonki use ‘sabhi lokon main sancharan karne vaala’ kaha gaya he
 Their rankings are so long that they measure the three worlds with their three footprints
 vishnu ke teen pad yadi sristi karte hai, sthaapan karte hai, dhaaran karte hai to vahiin par ashrith janon kaa paalan-poshan bhi kiya karte hai
 People receive their bhagya annadi as a prasad of the same three order, so that they experience ultimate fulfillment
 jo log vishnu kii stuti karte hai, unka ve sarvavidh kalyaan karte hai, kyonki unke stavnadi karm se use param sphurti milti he
 In this way, everyone is eager to reach the praise of Lord Vishnu
 ve varisht daata hai
 Trinity is also reflected in the qualities of Vishnu
 ve teen pad-kram vaale, teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale, teenon lokon ko naap lene vaale or lokatray ke dharak hai
 Similarly, he is also the equated form of 'tridhatu' ie satta, raja and tama or containing earth, water and light
 vishnu parthiv lokon kaa nirmaan or param vistrut antariksh aadi lokon kaa prasthaapan karne vaale hai
 They are the three types of movement in self-constructed worlds
 unki ye teen gatiyaan udbhav, sthiti or vilay kii pratik hai
 In this way, they are also the creators of everyone, both spinach and destroyer
 ve 'lokatray kaa akelaa dharak' hai
 They measure all three worlds alone with their three footprints
 lokatray ko naap lene se bhi yah falit hota he ki lokatray arthath vahaan ke samgr praani unke purna niyantran main hai
 Vishnu is also an embryo-protector
 garbhasth beej kii raksha ke liye or sundar balak kii utpatti ke liye vishnu kii prarthana kii jaati he
 Due to the clear emphasis on his foster nature, he has been called 'vishnurgopa Paraman Pati 

' meaning the protector of all, even in the Ahoratra fire form in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan rugveda ke ashtum mandal ke pachchisven sookt ke barahawein mantra kii vyakhya main bhi vishnu ko spasht rup se 'paalan se yukt' maanate hai
 xxrep 4 
 isliye samgr pariprekshya main rugveda main vishnu ko param hitaishi kaha gaya he
 Despite being mentioned in most mantras, Indra is called 'sukrit' and Vishnu is called 'sukritara'
 'sukruttarah' kaa acharya sayan ne 'uttam fal pradaan karne waalon main shreshth' arth kiya he; shripad satavlekar ji ne 'uttam karm karne waalon main sarvshereshth' arth kiya he or maharishi dayanand saraswati ji ne bhi 'ativ uttam karm vaala' arth kiya he
 Indra is 'sukrit' and Vishnu is 'sukritarah'
 taatpary spasht he ki rugveda main hi yah maan liya gaya he ki vishnu sarvocch hai
 Similarly, despite being the king of Indra, the supremacy of Vishnu is also clear in the Rigveda that in it it is said for Vishnu that "he holds the whole world alone" and Indra is told that he States do
 taatpary spasht he ki sristi ke sarjak evam paalak vishnu ne sanchaalan hetu indra ko raja banaaya he
 In this well-defined perspective, Brahmin texts related to the supremacy of Vishnu and later mythological beliefs also spontaneously emerge
 brahman-yug main yajna-sanstha kaa vipul vikaas hua or iske saath hi devamandali main vishnu kaa mahatva bhi pehle kii apeksha adhiktar ho gaya
 At the beginning of Aitareya Brahmana, in order to give place in yagya, starting with fire, Vishnu's place has been called 'param'
 inke madhya anya devataaon kaa sthaan he
 In this way, Vishnu has been given a much higher place in the Vedic Samhita texts than the fire that attained the foremost place
 vastutah vishnu ko mahattam to rugveda main bhi mana hi gaya he, par varnan kii alpata ke kaaran vahaan unka sthaan gaun lagata he
 He has been given the highest rank by the explicit statement in the Brahmin texts
 yah shreshthata is katha se bhi spasht hoti he ki vishnu ne apane teen pagon dwaara asuron se prithvi, veda tathaa vaani sab chhinakar indra ko de di
 This is the narrative conversion of the three steps of the Vedic Vishnu into Brahmins; And with this, the superiority of Vishnu also became clear in the Brahmin era itself
 aitarey brahman spasht rup se vishnu ko dwarpal kii tarah devataaon kaa sarvatha sangrakshak maanata he
 The signs available in the Rigveda and the Brahmins have had substantial additions to the Puranas - narrative as well, descriptive as well as explanatory
 puraanon ne is jagat ke mul main vartmaan, nity, ajanma, akshay, avyay, ekares tathaa hey ke abhaav se nirmal parabrahm ko hi vishnu sangya di he
 He is devoid of instructions and adjectives like 'paranaam Par:', the divine located in the inner soul, the supreme superior and the form, varna etc
 ve janm, vruddhi, parinaam, kshay or naash -- in chah vikaron se rahit hai
 They are widespread and the whole world is inhabited by them; That is why scholars call him 'vasudev'
 jis samay din, raat, akaash, prithvi, andhkaar, prakaash tathaa inke atirikt bhi kuch nahin tha, us samay ekmaatr vahi pradhan purush param brahm vidyaman the, jo ki indriyon or buddhi ke vishay nahin hai
 At the beginning of the universe, the same sentiment expressed by Lord Vishnu as Chatur Shloki Bhagwat in the original knowledge of Brahma, - i was the only one before creation
 mere atirikt na sthool tha na sookshm or na donon kaa kaaran agyaan
 Where this is not a creation, i am the one and i am the one who seems to be in the form of this creation and i am the one who will survive
 in sandarbhon se vishnu kii sarvocchata tathaa sarvaniyanta hone kii bhaavana spasht parilakshith hoti he
 Vishnu is believed to have two forms
 pratham rup-- pradhan purush or doosraa rup 'kaal' he
 These both combine and separate both creation and holocaust, or nature and man
 yah kaal rup bhagavan anadi tathaa anant hai; isliye sansar kii utpatti, sthiti or pralay bhi kabhi nahin rukate
 In the context of the origin of creation in the Bhagavata Maha Purana, known as the Sirmour of the Vaishnavas and the 'tilak of Puranas', it is said that the lotus emerged from the navel of Vishnu, who slept in Ekarnava, and realized all the qualities in it
 With the entry of Vishnu himself, the Vedmaya Brahma automatically emerged
 isi prakaar adhikansh puraanon main vishnu ko param brahm ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The Puranas are full of stories related to them
 paalankarta hone ke kaaran unhen jaagtik drushti se yada-kada vividh prapanchon kaa bhi sahaara lenaa padataa he
 Suggesting deception to be tricked by the Asuras, advising the gods on sea-churning for regaining sovereignty when the Asuras seize the kingdom; And by taking the form of erotic Mohini and enticing the Asuras to feed the nectar to the gods; Vishnu's deception in the stories mentioned in the sub-divisions like Devi Bhagwat and Shivpuran related to dissolving the essence of Tulsi for the slaughter of Shankhchud
 is sambandh main yah anivarytah dhyatavya he ki paalankarta hone ke kaaran ve parinaam dekhte hai
 Due to the disenfranchisement of the asuras / unjust by any boon, if the end of the unjust and deceit is scandalized, they do not hesitate to cheat
 ramavatar main chhipakar bali ko maarna tathaa krishnavatar main mahabharat yuddh main anek chhalon kaa vidhayak bananaa unke isi drushtikon kaa parichaayak he
 Carpenters use these stories as an antidote to arbitrary interpretation
 parantu inhen sandarbhik gyaan kii drushti se dekhnaa isliye aavashyak he kyonki puraanon yaa tatsambandhi granthon main ye prasang vipareet sthitiyon main saamaanya se itar vishisht kartavya ke gyaan hetu hi upasthaapit kiye gayi hai
 It is important to note that in Puranas, elemental knowledge is called Brahma, God and God
 vishnu kaa sampoorn swaroop gyanatmak he
 In the Puranas, the jewelery and armaments worn by them are also considered symbolic: - is prakaar samast srujanaatmak upadan tattvon ko vishnu apane sharir par dhaaran kiye rahete hai
 a stanza related to the figure of Srivishnu is very famous: - shantakaaran bhujagashyann padmanabhan sureshm
 Vishvadharan Gaganasudrash Megha Varnam Shubhangam
 
 Lakshmikantam Kamalanayanan Yogibhirdhyanagyam
 vande vishnu bhavabhayaharan sarvalokaikanatham
 
 bhavarth - jinaki akruti atishay shant he, jo sheshnag kii shaiya par shayan kiye hue hai, jinaki naabhi main camel he, jo devataaon ke bhi ishwar or sampurna jagat ke aadhaar hai, jo akaash ke sadrush sarvatra vyaapt hai, nilmegh ke samaan jinka varna he, atishay sundar jinke sampurna ang hai, jo yogiyon dwaara dhyaan karke praapt kiye jate hai, jo sampurna lokon ke swami hai, jo janm-maran rup bhay kaa naash karne vaale hai, aise lakshmipathi, kamalnetra bhagwaan vishnu ko main pranaam karata hoon
 Vishnu's superiority does not mean that Shiva or Brahma etc
 are inferior to him
 oonch-neech kaa bhav ishwar ke paas nahin hota
 It is just a priority to be virtuous in Leela for creation and operation
 isliye vaishnav ho yaa shaiva -- sabhi puraana tathaa mahabharat jaise shreshth granth ek swar se ghoshit karte hai ki ishwar ek hi hai
 It is said that the same Lord Janardhana holds these three nouns - 'brahma', 'vishnu' and 'shiva' - for the creation, condition and destruction of the world
 anekatra vishnu tathaa shiv ke ek hi hone ke spasht kathan uplabdh hote hai
 The word 'avatar' literally means the manifestation of God in the physical world through his independent power
 avatar kii siddhi do dashaon main maani jaati he -- ek to apane rup kaa parityag kar kaaryvash naveen rup kaa grahan; tathaa doosraa naveen janm grahan kar sambaddh rup main aana, jisamen mata ke garbh main uchit kaal tak ek sthiti kii baat bhi sannivisht he
 It does not involve changing the form for a short time or regaining the form of another
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke chaturth adhyay ke suprasiddh saatven evam aathven shloke main bhagavan ne swayan avatar kaa prayojan bataate hue kaha he ki -- jab-jab dharm kii haani or adharm kaa utthan ho jaataa he, tab-tab sajjanon ke paritran or dushton ke vinaash ke liye main vibhinn yugon main utpann hota hoon
 Apart from this, a specific and more lofty purpose has been said in the Bhagavata Mahapurana that God is beyond the nature of growth, destruction, etc
, is indestructible, eternal, nirguna
 to yadi ve avatar rup main apni lila ko prakat nahin karte to jeev unke ashesh gunon ko kaise samajhate? atah jeevon ke preranaroop kalyaan ke liye unhone apane ko tathaa apni lila ko prakat kiya
 Therefore, there are many odd situations in different avatar-stories so that the organism can understand what the proper path is according to the situation! vishnu ke avtaron kii pehali vyavasthit suchi mahabharat main uplabdh hoti he
 The total number of incarnations in Shantiparva of Mahabharata is stated to be 10: - hans: kurmashch matsyasch pradurbhava dwijottam 
 Varaho Narasimhash Vamno Ram & Ch
 raamo dashrathishchaev satvat: kalkirev c 
 That is, Hans Kurm Matsya Varaha Narasimha Vaman Parashurama Dasharathanandan Ram Yaduvanshi Shri Krishna and Kalki - all these are my avatars
 aage yah bhi kaha gaya he ki ye bhoot or bhavishya ke sabhi avatar hai
 The description in the text is of six incarnations: 1
 Varaha 2
 Narasimha 3
 Vaman 4
 Parasurama 5
 Ram 6
 Krishna chunki mahabharat buddha ke janm se purv kii athwa buddha ke avtari hone kii kalpana se pehle kii rachana he; atah swaabhaavik rup se usamen kahin buddha kaa namonishaan nahin he
 Instead of counting the swan as an avatar, the number of the Dash is complete
 mahabharat ke dakshinatya paath main avatar kaa varnan is prakaar he :- Matsya: Kurmo Varahash Narasimhash Vamana: raamo ramashch ramashch krishna: kalki c te dash
 Here, from the aforesaid incarnations, leaving the swan and adding the third Rama i
e
 Balarama, the number of Dash is complete
 is vivaran se ek baat pramanit ho jaati he ki mahabharat-kaal tak dash se adhik avtaron kii kalpana bhi nahin kii gayi thi; anyathaa un dash avtaron ko 'bhoot or bhavishya ke bhi sabhi avatar' nahin kaha gaya rahata
 Later, other avatars were also conceived and the total number of incarnations reached twenty-four
 bhagwat mahapurana main 22 tathaa 24 avtaron kii gananaa ke baavjood avtaron kii bahumanya sankhya mahabharat vaali dash hi rahi he
 Many Puranas like Padmapuran, Lingapurana, Varahapuran, Matsyapuran etc
 have mentioned about the same avatars
 agnipurana ke varnan main bhi bilkul vahi kram he
 The following verses of this context are generally universal: matsayah kurmo varahashch narsinghoth vamanh
 Ramo Ramash Krishnashta Buddha: Kalkishcha Te Dash is prakaar vishnu ke dash avatar hi bahumanyata praapt hai
 The brief details of these are as follows: - dashavathar ke atirikt anya chaudaa avtaron ke naam is prakaar hai :- 40 km / h on shorter paths arjuna ek teesri peedi kaa mukhya yudhak tanks he
 It has been developed by the Defense Research and Development Organization of India for the Indian Army

 Later, due to delays and other problems in its development from the 1990s to the 2000s, the Army ordered the purchase of T-90 tanks from Russia to meet the requirements that Arjun expected to fulfill
 Went

 Disaster is the effect of a natural or man-made risk that affects society or environment negatively
 The word disaster has come from astrology
 It means that when stars are in a bad state then bad events happen
 samakaleen shiksha main, aapadaa anuchit prabandhit jokhim ke parinaam ke rup main dekhi jaati he, ye khatre aapadaa or jokhim ke utpaada hai
 Disasters that occur in low risk areas are not called disasters, such as in uninhabited areas
 vikasshil desh aapadaa kaa baari mulya chukaate hai- aapadaa ke kaaran 95 % mautein vikasshil deshon main hoti hai or prakritik aapadaa se hone vaali mautein 20 guna zyada hai
 Of developing countries compared to industrialized countries

 Wisner et al reveal a general view when they argue that all disasters can be considered to be caused by humans, the reason being that any threat can turn into destruction before humans can stop it
 is prakaar sabhi aapadaa maanviya asafalataa kaa parinaam he, jo anuchit aapadaa prabandhan upayon kaa suchak hai aapadaa ko niyamit, prakritik va maanav nirmit ke bhedon main bata he
 However, there is no single root cause in a developing country
 ek vishesh aapadaa prabhaav ko badhaane vaala ho saktaa he bukamp, jo samudri taton main tsunami ke dwaara baadh laata he, iskaa ek utkrisht udhaaharan he
 a natural disaster is a natural result or earthquake) that affects humans
 uparyukt apatkalin prabandhan kii kami dwaara maanav subhedyata se vittiya, paryaavaran sambandhi yaa maanviya prabhaav hoten hai
 The resulting loss or resistance depends on the ability of the population to support the disaster
 samaj nirmaan main kendrit he "aapadaa ke samay khataron ke hone se jokhim hota he"
 Therefore, natural danger will never be a natural disaster in such areas
 yani nirjan kshetron main prabal bukamp prakritik shabd vivaadit he, kyonki ghatnayen, bina maanviya sahabhaagita ke aapadaa yaa khatara nahin he
 Disaster created due to human work, negligence, or failure of the system is called man-made disaster
 maanav nirmit aapadaa takniki yaa saamaajik kahe jate hai takniki aapadaa takanic kii asafalataa ke parinaam hai jaise ejineering asafalataa, yatayaat aapadaa yaa paryaavaran aapadaa, samet
saamaajik aapadaa ek majboot maanviya prerana he, jaise aapraadhik kriya, bhagdad, danga or yuddh

 It was often the case that a new dynasty would start but it had little influence for a long time and fought the already established dynasty
 aisa bhi hota tha ke koi parajeet rajvansh haarane ke baavjood kuch ilaaqon main prabhutv rakhata tha or china kaa singhaasana waapas chhinane kii koshish main juta rahata tha
 For example, in 1644, the Manchu-borne Ching dynasty captured Beijing and subjugated China
 lekin ching rajvansh san 1636 main hi shuru ho chukaa tha or us se bhi pehle san 1616 main ek anya naam ke naam se astitv main aa chukaa tha
 The Ming dynasty lost control of Beijing's monarchy in 1644, but their descendants continued to assert their authority on the throne until 1662 and tried to retake it

 According to Indian belief, knowledge is eternal, that is, there was knowledge even before the creation of the universe and after the destruction of the world, knowledge will remain

 The Vedas are four in number which are the pillars of Hinduism

 Among these, the Rikti Samhitas are praises predominant; The Brahmin Granth Yajna is the primary function and the Aranyaka and the Upanishads are the chief of the discussion

 vishwa ke sarvocch parvaton ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye san 1808 main britishon ne bharat kaa mahaan trikoshmetiya survey ko shuru kiya
 Starting in southern India, the survey team moved north, using a large 500 kg of theodolite to make the most accurate measurements possible
 ve himalay ke najadik pahaado ke paas pahunche san 1830 main, par nepal angrejon ko desh main ghusane dene ke prati anicchhuk tha kyonki nepal ko rajnatik or sambhavit akraman kaa dar tha
 Several requests were made by the surveyor, but Nepal rejected all the requests
 britishon ko tarai se avlokan jari rakhane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, nepal ke dakshin main ek kshetra he jo himalay ke samaanaantar main he
 The situation in the Terai was very difficult due to high rainfall and malaria: three survey officers died due to malaria while two were discharged due to poor health
 phir bhi, san 1847 main, british majaboor hue or avlokan stesan se lekar 240 kilometre dur tak se himalay ki shikharon ki vistaar se avlokan karne lage
 The weather stopped work at the end of the year for three months
 san 1847 ke navambar main, bharat ke british sarweyre jeneral andrayu vaug ne savaipur stesan jo himalay ke purvi chor par sthit he se kai saare avlokan taiyaar kiye
 At that time, Kanchenjunga was considered to be the highest peak in the world and he noted that there is a peak about 230 km behind it
 jon armastrang, jo vaug ke sah adhikari thea ne bhi ek jagah se dur pashchim main is chotii ko dekha jise unhone naam diya chotii ‘bi’
 Waugh later wrote that the observation indicates that the peak 'B' was higher than the Kanchenjunga, but the observation was from far away, it is necessary to observe closely for verification
 aane vaale saal main vaug ne ek survey adhikari ko tarai main chotii ‘bi’ ko nazdik se avlokan karne ke liye bheja par badalon ne saare prayaas ko roak diya
 In 1849, Waugh ceded the area to James Nicholson
 nicholson ne 190 kimi dur jirol se do avlokan taiyaar kiye
 Nicholson then brought a large conglomerate with him and headed east, with Nicholson from five different locations receiving more than 30 observations from 174 km to the nearest peak
 apane avlokanon par aadhaarit kuch hisaab-kitaab karne ke liye nicholson waapas patna, ganga nadi ke paas gaya
 Its rough calculation in Patna gave the average height of peak 'B' at 9,200 m मी, but it is not considered light refraction, which makes the elevation false
 sankhya saaf darshaya gaya, yadhyapi vah chotii ‘bi’ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha
 Although Nicholson suffered from malaria and was forced to return home, the accounts could not be finished
 maikel henacy, vaug kaa ek sahaayak roman sankhya ke aadhaar par chotiyon ko nirdisht karnaa shuru kar diya, usne kanchanajangha ko IX naam diya or choti ‘bi’ ko XV naam diya
 In May 1852, the center of the survey was brought to Dehradun, an Indian mathematician Radhanath Sikdar and a surveyor from Bengal named the world's highest peak for the first time using a trigonometric calculation based on Nicholson's Everest after a former chief
 , Repeated accounts were done to verify and its official statement, that XV is the tallest, was delayed for many years
 vaug ne nicholas ke data par san 1854 main kaam shuru kar diya or hisaab-kitaab, prakaash apvartan ke len-dein, vaayu-daab, avlokan ke vishaal duuri ke taapmaana par apane karmchaariyon ke saath lagbhag do saal kaam kiya
 In March 1856, through a letter, he completely announced his discovery to his representative in Calcutta
 kanchanajangha kii oonchaai saaf taur par 28,156 feet bataaya gaya, jabaki XV ki oonchaai bataai gai
 Vogue concluded about XV that "it is more probable that it is the tallest in the world"
 chotii XV kaa hisaab-kitaab lagaaya gaya ki yah puri tarah se 29,000 feet unchaa he, par ise saarvajanik rup main 29,002 feet bataaya gaya
 29,000 has been 'rounded' by an estimate 2 feet more was added to avoid this concept

 ise hajaaron varsh purv, himalayan kshetra ke kuch khandon nepal, kurmaanchal, kedarkhand, jalandhar, or suramya kashmir main upnaam ke rup prayog kiya jaataa he

 sanskrit sahitya main bharat ke natya shaastra main adhikanshat: naatakeey paatro ke vargeekaran prastut hue hai or vatsyayan ke kamasutra main etadvishyak bhed prabhed kiye gaye hai jinka sambandh praaia: stri-purush ke yon vyapaaron se he
 In "agnipuran", for the first time, the hero-heroine is discussed as the prolific influences of Shringar Ras
 sanskrit or hindi ke parvarti lekhakon ne "agnipurana" kaa sthiti sweekaar karte hue shringaarras kii simaaon main hi is vishay kaa vistaar kiya he
 These limitations, which have been violated as an exception only, can be understood as follows: bharat ne nayak ke chaar bhed kiye hai : dhiralalit, dhiraprashanth, dhirodatt, dhiroddhat
 These distinctions belong to the protagonist of the play
 "agnipurana" main inke atirikt chaar or bhedon kaa ullekh he : anukool, darkshin, shath, dhristh
 These distinctions are clearly related to the beauty of makeup
 bhoj ne "saraswatikanthabharan" tathaa "shringarprakash" main in do ke atirikt anya anek vargikarnon kaa ullekh kiya he
 But only one of those classifications, which was also mentioned by Bharata as a distinction of man, was accepted by the latter writers: Uttam, Madhyam, Adham
 bhanudutt ne "rasmanjri" main ek nayaa vargeekaran diya, jise aage chalakar pradhan vargeekaran mana gaya
 It is: husband, vice-chancellor
 anukool ityadi bhed pati or upapati ke antargat sweekaar kiye gaye
 Bhanudatta mentions another distinction named Prakrit
 rup goswami ne "ujjvalaneelamani" main vaishik sweekaar nahin kiya
 He considered Krishna the only hero
 hindi main nayakabhed ke pramukh lekhakon ne uparyukt vargikarnon main se pratham ko chhodkar shesh ko praaia: sweekaar kar liya he
 Considering husband, vice-chancellor, Vaishik as the main classification, the favorable, south, shash, hateful distinctions have been placed under the husband
 nayak ke uttam, madhyam, adham bhedon ko hindi main keval kuch lekhakon ne hi sweekaar kiya he, jinamein sundar, top or rasline pramukh hai
 Some other distinctions of the hero are as follows: Proached, obeyed, clever, ignorant
 maani ke do bhed hai : rupamani, gunmani
 There are also two distinctions of clever: vow clever, action-clever
 rasline ne inhen ke saath swayandoot nayak kaa bhi kathan kiya he
 Padmakar is also considered heroic after Bhanudutt's imitation of the ignorant
 keshav ne nayak ke prachhnn or prakaash bhed bhi maane hai
 By the opinion of Rasleen, there are three strains of vice and two strains of Vaishik
 hindi ke nayak-nayika-bhed sambandhi sahitya kaa nirmaan adhikanshat: reetikaal main hua he
 This poetry of hero-heroine-distinction is the result of a confluence of two powerful streams
 inamen se pehali dhara he sahityashastra evam nayak-nayika-bhed sambandhi shastreey granthon kii, jiskaa aarambh bharat ke "natshastra" se hota he; tathaa duusari dhara he krishna or gopiyon kii shringaar kridaaon ke varnan kii, jo "harivansh", "padam", "vishnu" "bhagwat" tathaa "brahmavaivatan" puraanon kii upatyakaon main bahati hui or umapatidhar, jayadev, chandidas, vidyapati, mira, narsingh mehta tathaa surdaas aadi anek bhakt kaviyon kii madhur vaani se vilsit hoti hui, nimbark, vallabh tathaa chaitanya jaise mahaan aacharyon ke samarthan se sampusht hui he
 From the point of view of Acharya, the Hindi writers' contribution of this part of poetry is extraordinary
 kavyasaushthav kii drushti se bhi vidwaanon ke matanusaar itane unche str ke sahitya kaa itane bade pariman main nirmaan hindi sahitya ke or kisi kaal main nahin hua
 According to Bharata, the heroine has eight distinctions: vasakaja, virahotkanthita, swadhinapatika, kalahantarita, khandita, vipralbdha, prakshitabhratika, abhinasarika
 ise ham paristhitibhed kahenge
 According to later writers, who have been called "prakriti-bhed", there are three types of heroines: Uttama, Madhyama, Adhama
 "agnipurana" ke lekhak ne nayika ke keval ek vargeekaran kaa ullekh kiya he : swakiya, parvikaya, punarbhu, samanya
 Of these four distinctions, Punarbhu was not subsequently recognized
 rudrat tathaa rudrabhatt ne ek shodash bhed vargeekaran prastut kiya, jise parvarti lekhakon dwaara sarvaadhik pradhanta di gai
 This classification is as follows: bhoj ne nayak kii bhanti nayika ke bhi kuch moulik vargeekaran kiye hai, kintu unhen parvarti lekhakon ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 Apart from the above three classifications, Bhanudutt has mentioned a new classification, which was later accepted by most Hindi writers
 vah he, : nayika : anyasambhogadu:khitaa, vakroktigarvita, maanavati
 Quibble: romanticism, aestheticism
 iske atirikt bhanudutt ne shodash bhed vargeekaran main mugdha evam oodhaa ke kuch naveen upabhedon kaa ullekh kiya he, jo is prakaar hai, mugdha : gyaatyauvana, agyatayauvana
 Mugdha is again a newborn, Vishrabandhanavoda
 oodhaa : gupta, vidagdha, lakshitha, kulata, anushayna,, mudita
 In Bharata's situational classification, Bhanudatta has added a new distinction named Proshyapatika, which later became known as Pravatsyapatika
 abhisarika ke antargat unhone jyotsnabhisarika, tamistrabhisarika tathaa divsabhisarika kaa ullekh kiya he
 Hindi writers have followed Bhanudutt the most
 shing bhoopal evam vishwanath ne samanya ke do upabhedon kaa ullekh kiya he : raktaa, virakta
 Vishwanath mentions five of Mugdha, five of Madhyas, and six of Pragalbha, but the number of heroines does not include these charges
 goswami ne keval "harivallabhaon" ko nayika maanate hue samanya ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 He has also considered Mugdha, Madhyam, Pragalbha Bheda under Perkiya
 rup goswami dwaara ullikhit mugdha ke chha:, madhya ke chaar tathaa pragalbha ke saat prabhed vishwanath krit prabhedon se milte julate hai
 The number of heroic texts in Hindi is more than two hundred, but most of them are unpublished
 sarvaadhik lokapriy granthon main matiram kaa "rasraj" tathaa padmakar kaa "jagadvinod" agrani hai
 Bhanudatta's "rasamanjari" is often followed in these texts
 paristhiti-bhed-vargeekaran main aagatapatika naam kaa ek dasavaan bhed joda gaya he, jise hindi ke adhikansh lekhakon na aarambh se hi sweekaar kiya he
 Rahim's "barwai-heroine-distinction" also became famous due to the melody of the Barwai verses
 anya praarambhik granthon main "hit-tarangini", "sahityalahari", "rasmanjri", "rasikapriya", "sundarshringaar", "sudhanidhi", "kavikulakalpataru" tathaa "bhashaabhushan" ke naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 Kumaramani Shastri, Dev, Dev, Rasleen and Bhikharidas are more important due to their original contribution in later writers
 nayikabhed ke kshetra main aadhunik kaal main hariudh, biharilal bhatta tathaa prabhudayal mital ne ullekhneey kaary kiya he
 Kriparam's "hitarangarani" is the first available treatise on heroine in Hindi, yet it discusses the subject in great detail
 is granth kii kuch moulik udbhaavnaayen is prakaar hai- Surdas's "sahitya Lahiri" is a style of code
 iskaa prayek pad praaia: kisi ek alankaar tathaa kisi ek nayika kaa udhaaharan prastut karata he
 Samanya was not recognized in this book
 nandadaas kii "rasmanjri" kii apni visheshtaayen hai
 Samanya's statement has been made in this, but no importance has been given to him
 isamen nayikaon kii paribhaashaayen itani vistrut hai ki vanrya nayika kaa chitra sa prastut ho jaataa he or udaahranon kaa abhaav nahin khatkata
 Keshavdas has also mentioned Samanya in his "rasikapriya", not even given his definition
 unhone vishwanath or rup goswami ke anukaran par mugdha, madhya tathaa pragalbha ke prabhed kiye he
 Preamabhisarika, Garvabhisarika and Kamabhisarika are mentioned under the Abhinasarika, and the light and hidden name of each of the distinctions are discerned
 coccoke ke kaamshaastra sambandhi granth "ratirahasy" ke aadhaar par nayika ke padmini, chitrini, shankhini tathaa hastini bhedon kaa bhi ullekh hua he
 These distinctions have been repeated by Sundar and some other writers
 "sundarashringaar" ke anya vargeekaran praaia: "rasraj" ke samaan hai
 Tosh mentions several fundamental classifications in "sudhanidhi" - chintamani ne "kavikulakalpataru" main mugdha, tathaa pragalbha ke prabhed kiye hai
 Jaswantsinh's "bhasha Bhushan" has been a slaughtering of students due to its shortness
 isamen vibhinn nayikaon kii keval paribhaashaayen hi di gai hai
 It has special value in the form of ornamentation
 kumaarmani shastri ne "rasikarsaal" main keval naveen bhedprabhedon kaa hi ullekh nahin kiya, puraane bhedon main nae sambandh bhi sthapit kiye hai
 Their major fundamental installations are as follows - "rasvilas" main unhone pad, jati tathaa prantiyata ke aadhaar par nayikaon kaa varnan kiya he, jo chitropamata evam sookshmdarshita kii drushtiyon se adwitiya he
 The passage of "sukhsagargarang" is famous: gandharvi ke antargat, arthath saadhe das se saadhe choubees varsh tak kii avasthaa ke bich main, mugdha, madhya tathaa pragalbha ke 13 prabhedon main se prayek kii ayusima nirdhaarit kii gai he
 The most elaborate of heroines is available in Rasleen's "rasprabodh"
 unki pramukh moulik uplabdhiyaan is prakaar hai - bhikharidas has repeated many beliefs of his Tosh and Rasleen in "shringarirnayanay"
 anyasambhogadu:khitaa kaa vipralabdha ke antargat rakhkar unhone apni moulik sujh kaa parichay bhi diya he
 In modern period writers, "hariyodh" has shown its originality in the strains of Uttama and Madhyama
 unke "rasakalash" main in bhedon kaa pratham baar vibhaajan kiya gaya he, jo is prakaar he - Bihari Lal Bhatt has often accepted the beliefs of Kumaramani Shastri regarding the circumstances
 unke "sahityasagar" main dhira, adhira tathaa dhiradhira bhedon kaa sambandh keval kanishtha se mana gaya he
 Prabhudayal Mital has given recognition to the classification accepted by Bhanudatta, Matiram, Padmakar, etc
, even after thoroughly discussing the subject of heroine
 shail lakshan bhuvigyaan kii vah shakha he jisamen shailon ke daanon kaa aakaar, kan-aakaar tathaa bhautik evam rasinic gunon aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he

 Although the term democracy is used in a political context, the principle of democracy is also relevant for other groups and organizations
 multah loktantr bhinn bhinn siddhanton ke mishran se banate hai, par matdaan ko loktantr ke adhikansh prakaaron kaa charitragat lakshan mana jaataa he
 According to the definition of democracy it is "rule by the people, by the people, by the people"
 lekin alag-alag deshkal or paristhitiyon main alag-alag dharanaon ke prayog se isaki avadharana kuch jatil ho gayi he
 Many proposals have been made in the context of democracy since ancient times, but many of them were never implemented
 pratinidhi loktantr main janata sarkari adhikariyon ko sidhe chunati he
 Representatives are elected from a district or parliamentary constituency or represent all voters in several proportional arrangements
 kuch deshon main mishrit vyavastha prayukt hoti he
 Although representatives in such a democracy are elected by the people, the representatives themselves decide the policies to act in the public interest
 yadhyapi dalgat nitiyaan, matadaataaon main chhavi, punah chunaav jaise kuch kaarak pratinidhiyon par asar daalate hai, kintu saamanytah inamen se kuch hi badhyakaari anudesh hote hai
 The greatest feature of this system is that the mandate pressure acts to curb policy deviations, as elections are mandatory for the legitimacy of power at regular intervals
 ek tarah kaa pratinidhi loktantr he, jisamen svachh or nishpaksh chunaav hote hai
 Characteristic features of liberal democracy include security of minorities, law and order, distribution of powers, etc
 Freedom of expression, language, assembly, religion and property are prominent
 pratyaksh loktantr main sabhi naagarik saare mahatvapurn nitigat faislon par matdaan karte hai
 It is called direct because in principle it has no representative or mediator
 sabhi pratyaksh loktantr chote samudaay yaa nagar-rashtron main hai
 Example - Switzerland pracheen kaal me bharat main sudrudh vyavastha vidyaman thi
 We find evidence of this from ancient literature, coins and inscriptions
 videshi yatriyon evam vidwaanon ke varnan main bhi is baat ke pramaan hai
 The electoral system for the ruler and other officials of government was the same as in the ancient republican system
 yogyata evam gunon ke aadhaar par inke chunaav kii prakriya aaj ke daur se thodi bhinn jarur thi
 Not all citizens had the right to vote
 rugveda tathaa kautilya sahitya ne chunaav paddati kii pushti kii he parantu unhone vot dene ke adhikaar par roshni nahin daali he
 Like the present Parliament, councils were formed in ancient times which resembled the present parliamentary system
 ganraajya yaa sangh kii nitiyon kaa sanchaalan inhen parishadon dwaara hota tha
 Its members were huge

 At the same time, there were 5000 members of the Central Council of Yudayya

 Before any issue was decided, it was openly discussed among the members
 sahi-galat ke akalan ke liye paksh-vipaksh par joardaar bahes hoti thi
 Only then a unanimous decision was rendered
 sabaki sahmati na hone par bahumat prakriya apanaayi jaati thi
 In many places it was mandatory to have consensus
 bahumat se liye gayi nirnay ko ‘bhooyisikkim’ kaha jaataa tha
 Voting had to be resorted to
 tatkaaleen samay main vot ko 'chand' kaha jaataa tha
 Like the Election Commissioner, there was an officer overseeing this election called 'shalakagrahaka'; Used to say vot dene ke liye teen pranaliyaan thim- Esoteric - that is, by writing your vote on a letter in which the name of the person who voted was not known
 vivruthak – is prakriya main vyakti sambandhit vishay ke prati apane vichaar sabake saamne prakat karata tha
 That is, open public announcement
 sankarnajalpak - sadsy in teenon main se koi bhi ek prakriya apnaane ke liye swatantra the
 The chalakagrahaka used to calculate these votes with complete promptness and honesty
 is tarah ham pate hai ki pracheen kaal se hi hamaare desh main gauravshaalee loktantreey parampara thi
 Apart from this, a number of ministries were also created to govern orderly governance
 uttam gunon evam yogyata ke aadhaar par in mantralayon ke adhikariyon kaa chunaav kiya jaataa tha
 The major departments of the ministries were- audyogic tathaa shilp sambandhi vibhaag State Department janaganana Determination of rules of sale and purchase mantrimandal kaa ullekh hamen arthshaastra, manusmriti, shukraniti, mahabharat, ityadi main praapt hota he
 In the Yajurveda and Brahmin texts, they were called 'ratni'
 mahabharat ke anusaar mantrimandal main 6 sadsy hote the
 According to Manu, the number of members was 7-8
 shukr ne iske liye 10 kii sankhya nirdhaarit kii thi
 Their functions were as follows: - purohit- yah raja kaa guru mana jaataa tha
 This position was given only to a person skilled in both politics and religion
 uparaj - iskaa kaary raja kii anupasthiti main shashan vyavastha kaa sanchaalan karnaa tha
 pradhan-pradhan or Prime Minister was the most important member of the Cabinet
 vah sabhi vibhaagon kii dekhbhaal karata tha
 Secretary- Like the present defense minister, his job was to look after the security related work of the state
 sumantra- rajya ke aay-vyay kaa hisaab rakhana iskaa kaary tha
 Chanakya called this a competence
 amaatya- amaatya kaa kaary sampurna rajya ke prakritik sansadhano kaa niyaman karnaa tha
 Envoy - Like the present-day intelligence, the job of the envoy was to organize the intelligence department
 yah rajya kaa atyant mahatvapurn evam samvedansheel vibhaag mana jaataa tha
 Apart from these, there were many departments
 itnaa hi nahin vartmaan kaal kii tarah hi panchayat vyavastha bhi hamen apane desh main dekhne ko milti he
 Villages were considered the basic unit of governance
 prayek gaanv main ek gram-sabha hoti thi
 The administration system of the village, from the judicial system to every welfare work of the village was carried out
 inkaa kaary gaanv kii prayek samasya kaa nipataara karnaa, aarthik unnati, raksha kaary, samunnat shashan vyavastha kii sthapana kar ek adarsh gaanv taiyaar karnaa tha
 The head of the Gram Sabha was called Gramani
 sara rajya choti-choti shashan ikaayiyon main banta tha or prayek ikai apane main ek chote rajya si thi or sthanik shashan ke nimitt apane main purna thi
 The governing power of the entire state was under one assembly, whose members were the heads of those governing units
 ek nishchit kaal ke liye sabakaa ek mukhya athwa adhyaksh nirvaachit hota tha
 If the assembly was large, an executive committee consisting of some of its members was elected
 yah shashan vyavastha athens main clysthenij ke samvidhan se milti-julati thi
 There were people of all ages, young and old in the meeting
 unki baithak ek bhawan main hoti thi, jo sabhaagaar kehalaata tha
 According to an ancient mention, the culprit was first presented to an officer named 'vinichayamahatram' for consideration
 nirparaadh hone par abhiyukt ko vah mukt kar saktaa tha par dand nahin de saktaa tha
 Used to send him to a higher court than himself
 is tarah abhiyukt ko chah ucch nyaayalayon ke sammukh upasthit hona padataa tha
 Only the king had the right to punish
 dharamshastra or purv kii najiron ke aadhaar par hi dand hota tha
 There were many republics in the country
 maury samrajya kaa udai in ganraajyon ke liye vinaashkari siddh hua
 But after the fall of the Maurya Empire, some new democratic states were born

 The details of some of the major republics of ancient India are as follows: - shakya- shakya ganraajya vartmaan basti or gorakhpur jila ke kshetra main sthit tha
 The capital of this republic was Kapilavastu
 yah saat deevaaron se ghira hua sundar or surakshit nagar tha
 There were eighty thousand total and five lakh people in this union

 This assembly served both administration and justice

 Experts and special public here used to give some decision after consulting

 Shuddhodana Shakya, the father of Lord Buddha, was a Kshatriya king

 Lichchhavi - The Lichchhavi Republic was located to the north of the Ganges

 Its remains are found in Basadh village of Muzaffarpur district of Bihar

 There were two committees for governance
 pehali nau sadasyon kii samiti vaideshik sambandhon kii dekhbhaal karti thi
 The second eight-member committee administered the administration
 ise ishtkul kaha jaataa tha
 There were three types of experts in this system - decision-making, practical and formulaic
 lichhavi ganraajya tatkaaleen samay kaa bahut shaktishaalee rajya tha
 Repeated attacks were made on it
 antat: magadharaj ajatshatru ne is par akraman karke ise nasht kar diya
 But in the fourth century AD, it again became a powerful republic
 vajji- lichhavi, videh, kundgram ke gyaatruk gana tathaa anya paanch chote ganraajyon ne milakar jo sangh banaaya usee ko vajji sangh kaha jaataa tha
 The ruler of Magadha continued to attack it

 In this republic, the armies of Alexander fought strongly

 Apart from these, the republics of Arishta, Autumvar, Kath, Kunind, Kshudraka, Patanaprastha, etc
 are also found in the ancient Ganths
 prayek rajya chaahe vah udaaravaadi ho yaa samaajawaadee yaa samyavaadee, yahaan tak ki sena ke general dwaara shasit pakistan kaa adhinayakawadi bhi apane ko loktantric kahata he
 To be honest, in today's era, claiming to be democratic has become a fashion
 loktantr kii purnatah sahi or sarvamaanya paribhaasha dena kathin he
 Cranston has rightly said that there are different perceptions regarding democracy
 linset kii paribhaasha adhik vyapak prathit hoti hai uske anusaar, “loktantr ek aisi raajnneetik pranali he jo padaadhikariyon ko badal dene ke niyamit sanvidhanik avasar pradaan karti he or ek aise rachanaatantr kaa praavdhaan karti he jiske tahat jansankhya kaa ek vishaal hissaa raajnneetik prabhaar praapt karne ke icchhuk pratiyogiyon main se manonukool chayan kar mahatvapurn nirnyon ko prabhavit karti he
 Defining democracy, mcpherson considered it 'the only constructive system in which governments are elected and authorized or laws are made and decided in some other form
 ‘ shoopter ke anusaar, ‘loktantric vidhi raajnneetik nirnay lene hetu aisi sansthagat vyavastha he jo janata kii saamaanya ichha ko kriyanvit karne hetu tatpar logon ko chaynit kar saamaanya hit ko saadhane kaa kaary karti he
 In fact, democracy is basically a system associated with participatory politics for civil and political freedom
 loktantr kii avadharana ke sambandh main pramukh siddhanth nimnlikhit hai: Concepts such as freedom, equality, rights, secularism and justice occupy a prominent place in the liberal tradition of democracy, and liberal thinkers have been advocating democracy as the best system to embody these concepts from the beginning
 nripatiyon or saamanti prabhuon se mukti ke baad samaaj ke shashan-sanchaalan kii drushti se loktantr ko swaabhaavik raajnneetik pranali ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya
 macpherson says that concepts like selection politics, competitive polity and market polity had developed even before the advent of democracy in the Western world
 hakeekat main is arth main udaar rajya kaa hi loktantrikaran ho gaya, na ki loktantr kaa udaarikaran
 The early signs of democratic sentiment can be found in the literature of British thinkers such as Tomsmoor and Winstanley and in the literature of British Extremism, but the true beginning of democratic sentiment began with the birth of the principle of social contract, because the inherent sense of social contract of citizens is the same for all individuals
 Equality
 thomas hobbs ne apni pustak ‘leviathan‘ main pramukh loktantric siddhanth kii vakaalat karte hue likhaa ki sarkaar kaa nirmaan janata dwaara ek saamaajik sanvida ke tahat hota he
 John Locke said that government should be done by the public and for his own benefit
 adam smith ne mukt bazaar kaa pratimaan is loktantric aadhaar par hi prastut kiya ki prayek vyakti ko utpaadan karne, kharidne or bechney kii swatantraaa he
 The famous utilitarian philosophers Mill and Bentham fully supported democracy and provided it with an effective intellectual foundation through utilitarianism
 unke anusaar, loktantr upyogetavaad arthath adhiktam logon ke adhiktam sukh ko adhiktam sangrakshan pradaan karata he, kyonki log apane shaskaon se tathaa ek duusare se sangrakshan kii apeksha rakhte hai or is sangrakshan ko sunishchit karne ke sarvottam tareeke hai, pratinidhimulak loktantr, sanvaidhanik sarkaar, niyamit chunaav, gupt matdaan, pratiyogi daleey raajnneeti or bahumat ke dwaara shashan
 J

 Mill added another point to Bentham's argument in favor of democracy, stating that democracy contributes more to the moral development of mankind than any other system of governance
 uski drushti main loktantr naitik atmotthana or vaiyaktik kshamtaaon ke vikaas evam vistaar kaa sarvocch madhyam he
 In this connection, it is noted that neither Bentham and Mill had any universal adult suffrage or one person favored one vote
 1802 tak bentham ne simit matadhikaar kii vakaalat kii or 1809 main sirf sampann virgon ke grihaswamiyon ke liye simit matadhikaar kaa naaraa diya or antatogatva 1817 main saarvbhaum matadhikaar kaa aahvaan kiya, lekin is adhikaar ko mardon tak hi simit rakhaa
 Similarly, Mill was also not in favor of universal adult suffrage, as he feared that the people of one class could maintain their dominance by being a majority and could only legislate their own interests against the interests of other classes
 aage chalakar usne apni pustak ‘ripregententive government‘ main usne kuch logon ke liye ek se adhik matdaan kii vakaalat kii lekin khayraat paane vaale akinchanon, niraksharon, diwaaliyon, kar nahin chukaane waalon ko, arthath un sabhi logon ko jo sanyukt rup se shramik varg kaa nirmaan karte hai, isse vanchit rakhaa
 He was only a supporter of a representative government that does not interfere with basic commonalities and follows a policy of free market and intervention
 baad ke udaaravaadi vichaarak loktantr kaa samarthan karte rahe or pashchimi europe tathaa uttari america ne isaki sweekaaryata ko or aage badhaane kaa kaam kiya
 The archaic liberal view of democracy has been challenged by many thinkers from time to time
 prathamtah, loktantr kii is manyata par prashn khadey kiye gaye hai ki prayek vyakti yah jaanata he ki uske liye sarvottam kya he
 Thinkers such as Lord Bryce, Graham Walls etc
 believe that man is not as judicious, neutral, knowledgeable or active as he is supposed to be for the operation of democracy
 dwitiyatah, loktantr janata ke shashan kii aadharshila par tikaa hota he, kintu yah spashtatah batalaana aasaan nahin he ki ‘shashan‘ or ‘janata‘ ke bilkul sahi arth kya he
 Hence Lokmat as the basis of government is a myth
 tritiytah loktantr se apeksha kii jaati he ki vah saamaanya hit kaa kaam karegaa, lekin saamaanya hit jaisi koi cheez nahin bhi ho sakati he
 The common interest in any society can hold different meanings for different people
 chaturthatah, puraatan udaaravaadi siddhanth samooh manovigyaan, samuhik utpeedan or pratyaayan tathaa janottejak netritv jaise karkon kii upeksha kar detaa he
 Fifthly, in democracy the party system often becomes a game of elite or controlled by those who are resourceful and they decide on important issues
 phir, niti-nirdhaaran kii prakriya bhi kaaphi jatil he
 Liberals have unduly considered it to be simple, transparent and just
 or sabase badi truti is siddhanth main yah he ki yah raajnneetik samanta kintu aarthik vishmata par aadhaarit he
 In the twentieth century, political thinkers began to raise the question whether the masses can play a role in politics in everyday life? Can ordinary citizens, who are engaged in earning their livelihood, invest time and power to play a political role? Will freedom be destroyed if the people openly display their feelings through electoral democracy without any restrictions? In answer to these questions, aristocratic and pluralistic principles of democracy have developed
 abhijan pad kaa prayog kisi samooh ke aise alpsankhyak varg ke liye hota he jo kuch karkon kii vajah se samudaay main vishisht haisiyat rakhte hai
 It takes place in a leading role in the distribution of power in a minority class society
 raajnneetik shreshthivarg, presnts ke anusaar, saamudayik maamalon main apane sankhya-bal ke anupaat main kahin zyada satta kaa upbhog karata he
 The emergence of the aristocracy in the context of democracy occurred after World War II, among the promoters of this theory are Wilfredo Pareto, Gratanomowska, Robert Michels, and American authors James Barnham and C
 Wright Mills
 is siddhanth kaa mukhya aadhaar yah manyata he ki samaaj main do tarah ke log hote hai- gine chune vishisht leg or vishaal jansamooh
 Distinguished people always reach the summit because they are the best people with all the qualifications
 abhijan varg vishesh rup se raajnneetik abhijan varg, saare raajnneetik krityon kaa nishpaadan karata he, satta par ekadhikaar kar letaa he or satta se jude saare laabh uthaata he
 The majority group is arbitrarily controlled and guided by the elite
 sangathit alpsankhyak hi hameshaa asangathit jansamooh ko shasit or nirdeshit karata he
 Robert Michels has used the phrase 'iron law of oligarchy' to say that the general classes must accept the subjugation of the elite class because a large section of the population is indifferent and incompetent in self-rule
 loktantr ke abhijan siddhanth kii mukhya visheshtaye hai : The well-known rendering of the elitist theory of democracy was first done by Joseph Schumpeter in his book 'capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'
 baad main sartori, robert daal, ikstine, remand aron, karl main hiyumond, sidney varba aadi ne apni rachanaaon main is mat kaa samarthan kiya
 This concept of democracy is based on the belief that the vast majority of the population is inefficient and neutral and that they elect some people based on merit and ability who control and govern the political party
 bahusankhyak log jeevika kamaane main vyast rahete hai
 They have neither interest nor understanding in political matters
 isliye ve abhijanvarg se kuch logon kaa chayan kar lete hai or unke anuyaayi ban jate hai
 According to the elitist theory, expertise is essential for efficiency in today's complex society and the number of experts is always small
 atah rajnatik netritv aise chuninda sakasham logon ke haath main hona aavashyak he
 This theory also considers the extreme participation of people as dangerous, because a powerful leader like dictator, Hitler, can mobilize the masses to destroy power and end democracy, which means the end of fundamental freedoms
 isliye unka daawa he ki loktantric or udaaravaadi mulyon ko bachaae rakhane ke liye jansamooh ko raajnneeti se alag rakhana jaruri he
 According to the eligibility principle, there cannot be actual rule by the general public
 shashan hameshaa janata ke liye hota he, janata ke dwaara kabhi nahi, kyonki janata jinhen pratinidhi chunati he ve abhijanvarg ke hi hote hai
 In other words, democracy means the rivalry among the elite classes and the decision by the public as to which elite will rule above
 is prakaar, loktantr maatr ek aisi karypranali he jiske dwaara chote samoohon main se ek janata ke newnatakam atirikt samarthan se shashan karata hai abhijanvaadee siddhanth yah bhi maanata he ki abhijan virgon- raajnneetik dalon, netaaon, bade vyapaaree gharaanon ke karypalkon, svaichhik sanghathanon ke netaaon or yahaan tak ki shramik sanghathanon ke bich mataiky aavashyak he taaki loktantr kii aadharbhoot karypranali ko gaiyr jimmdar netaaon se bachaaya ja sake
 This makes it clear that the elitist class theory externally claims to make the idea of democracy more pragmatic and empirical, but ultimately it transforms democracy into a conservative political theory that is satisfied with liberal or neo-liberal status quoism Gets and wants to maintain its durability
 abhijanwaad kii kai vichaarkon ne aalochana kii he jinamein si

 macmmersan, greem dancan, bairi holden, robert daal aadi pramukh hai
 The following are the main objections against this principle: loktantr kaa bahulwaadi siddhanth bhi jan saamaanya ke badale samoohon kii bhoomika par bal detaa he
 Some thinkers have represented such principles related to democracy which are a mixture of aristocratic principles and pluralistic principles
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki bahulwaadi siddhanth kii utpatti abhijan siddhanth kii aanshik pratikriya ke rup main hui he
 The elitist theory is satisfied with the creation of a situation in which power lies in the elites who make important decisions, but the pluralist insists on a system that will nullify the tendency of elitism in liberal democracies and reveal the right publicity 
 bahulwaad kii avadharana vaise to puraani he, kintu beesvin sadi main aadhunik udaaravaadi chintan kaa yah ek mahatvapurn ang ban gaya
 In general, pluralism propagates and decentralizes power in lieu of limiting it to a small group in society
 aadhunik audyogic or praudyogic kaal main, bahulawaadiyon ke anusaar, satta vikhandit ho gai he or isamen pratiyogi saarvajanik or nijee samoohon kii saajhedaari bad gai he
 People in high places no longer hold power like in the past, mainly because they began to play the role of mediator between conflicting interests
 vibhinn samooh apane netritv ke madhyam se madhyasthata karte hai or iske jariye vyakti kaa bhi pratinidhitiv ho jaataa he
 Although power has become concentrated among a few individuals due to industrial and technological integration and technological considerations, competition among minority but larger, interest groups goes in favor of public interest
 bade vyapaaree gharaanon, shram or sarkaar ke bich pratiyogita ne prayek samooh ko apni satta kaa durupyog karne par lagaam kasi he
 Thus, inequality in property, education and power among citizens is less affected as organizations and groups provide more representation than expected and this makes democracy more real and in this sense more viable
 bharat kaa hi udhaaharan len
 Here, the farmer organization of Mahendra Singh Tikait and the Narmada Bachao Andolan are such people's movements that become the voice of millions of poor and uneducated people
 or loktantr ko nishchay hi adhik vaastavik banaate hai
 It is true that the elites and their news media criticize them and call them a hindrance to progress and sometimes even the Supreme Court forces them to stop their movements, but in spite of all this, such mass movements make Indian democracy more meaningful
 And make delegates
