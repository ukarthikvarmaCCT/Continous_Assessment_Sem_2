 Often this is very important, because it can predict the harmful condition of harmful insects
 isliye andon ke aakaar, rup or rang tathaa andey rakhane ke sthaan or vidhi kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Eggs can be flat, cauliflower, spherical, conical and wide
 andey kaa upree aavaran purna rup se chikna yaa vibhinn prakaar ke chinhnonvala hota he
 Eggs are laid separately or in communities
 telchatte ke andey dimbhakoshth ke bheetar rahete hai
 Eggs from aquatic insects are covered with a sticky paste
 andey main vruddhi karte hue bhrun ke poshan ke liye paryaapt maatra main bhojan, jo yoke kehalaata he, paaya jaataa he
 Eggplantation occurs in various ways
 andey aise sthanon par rakhe jate hai, jahaan utpann honevaali santan kii tatkaaleen aavashyaktaayen purna ho saken
 Females of some castes fly low, dropping their eggs randomly
 bahut se shalbhon kii maadaaen, jinke dimbh ghaas yaa uski jad khate he, udate samay apane andey ghaas par giraati chali jaati hai
 Eggs are usually laid on such plants, entered into the tissue of the plants that they eat in the ovum, such as some types of locusts
 kuch keet apane andey mitti main rakhte hai
 The insects of the parasitic castes lay their eggs above or within the nutrients that nourish their offspring
 vibhinn jatiyon kii maadaaon ke andon kii sankhya vibhinn hoti he
 The females of some castes of Drumayuka lay only one large egg during the winter
 gharelu makkhi apane jivan main 2,000 se adhik andey rakhti he
 The termite queen has the highest egg-laying power
 yah prati second ek anda de sakati he or apane chah se baarah varsh tak ke jivan main 10,00,000 andey detii he
 Addition begins after the impregnation of the egg
 prarambh main do staravaala mul patta yaa germ band banataa he, jo anuprastha rekhaon dwaara bees andon main vibhakt ho jaataa he
 The next six segments form the head, the latter three segments the chest and the remaining segments together with the telsen
 pratham khand or telson ke atirikt prayek khand main ek joda bhruneey avyav viksit ho jaataa he
 The first pair of components belong to the second block and form the rings
 dwitiya jodi bahut hi choti or kshanik hoti he
 The components of the third, fourth and fifth pair develop into mandibles, maxillae, and labium
 inke peeche vaale teen jodi avyav kuch bade tathaa spasht hote hai
 It is the anterior of the legs
 udar ke avyavon kii antim jodi sarasai ban jaati hai kintu shesh sab jodiyaan dimbh nikalne se purv hi praaia: nasht ho jaati he
 Breaking the egg - When the embryo has fully developed and is ready to hatch, the hatchet comes out by removing the pre-made cap with its thorns that break the egg
 kuch kiton main aarambh main bhrun vaayu nigalkar apana vistaar itnaa badha lete hai ki shukti tut jaati he
 Her muscles help the child to get out
 andey se nikalne ke pashchaat hi vruddhi aarambh hoti he
 The increase in size of insect from birth to adulthood is very surprising
 praudh keet kii taul janm hone ke samay kii taul se 1,000 se 70,000 guna tak ho sakati he
 Such a growth cannot take place within a shell whose expansion cannot be increased
 at: khol kaa tootna ati aavashyak he
 This is possible only with the fall of the snakeskin
 jeern bahyatvak ko kentul kehete hai
 Before the rupture of a chronic ectoderm, cells within the epidermis within it emit a new ectoderm
 tatpashchaat inamen se kuch vishesh prakaar kii koshikaon se, jo kentul granthiyaan kehalaati hai, ek drav padaarth nikalataa he
 This fluid substance dissolves the inner layer of the old exterior and separates it from the new external, making it soft and itself becomes a finer membrane between the old and new exterior
 aise samay main keet main vruddhi ho jaati he
 The shape of the insect after the fall of the snake is called instar
 jab keet andey se nikalataa he to pratham instar hota he, pratham kentul patan ke pashchaat keet dwitiya instar hota he, antim inastar purna keet yaa praudh keet kehalaata he
 In most insects, the shape and form of the egg that comes out of the egg is very different from the adult insect
 bahut se kiton main dimbh kii akruti or rup main praudh banane tak anek parivartan aa jate hai
 These types of changes are called transformations
 jin kiton main roopantaran nahin hota unhen roopantaranhin kehete hai
 An example of this is Leha
 adhiktar kiton main roopatanran hota he or aise keet metabola kehalaate hai
 There are two types of functional obsolescence found in insects
 ye ninf or dimbh kehalaate hai
 Nymph is called a late stage insect which is more advanced when it hatches
 ninf kaa purna keet se yah bhed hota he ki isamen paksh tathaa bahya jananendriyaan viksit nahin hoti
 They reside on the site and the sides develop externally
 ninf se purna keet tak kii vruddhi kramik hoti he or pupa nahin banataa he
 The incomplete transformation of this type of transformation and the insect community is called hemimetabola, such as a reed petal
 dimbh us apraudh avasthaa ke keet se bahut bhinn hota he
 No external sign of the sides is found in it
 dimbh ko purna keet banane se pehle pupa bananaa padataa he
 This type of change is called complete conversion, such as in a domestic fly
 atyalp kiton main upariparivardhan hota he
 In these poles, excessive changes in ovum state are also found
 inamen chaar yaa isse adhik spasht instar hote hai
 There is also a lot of difference in their life and behavior
 is prakaar ke parivartan ko hyper roopantaran kehete hai, jaisaa cantharis main
 Regulation of conversion to insects is related to two hormones - the decaying hormone and the infancy hormone
 kentul-patan-kaarak hormone praaia: vakshiya granthi utsarjit karata he
 This makes the derm of the hormone moth
 praudh main vakshiya granthi lupt ho jaati he, isaliye kentulapatan bhi samaapt ho jaataa he
 If the thoracic gland of nymph is deposited in the adult, then the adult will also start to ejaculate
 shishav hormone karpora alata utsarjit karte hai
 This hormone suppresses the symptoms of adulthood and helps in rapidly eradicating the symptoms of nymphs
 roopantaran ke samay vakshiya granthi kii kriyasheeltaa bad jaati he or iske hormone kaa prabhaav itnaa paryaapt hota he ki shishav hormonon ke prabhaav ko kuchal detaa he or is prakaar roopantaran ho jaataa he
 Needs are fluent and very active
 inke shwasaradhran band hote he
 Respiration occurs by the reservoir
 ye campodiiform hote hai, arthath taange bhalee-bhanti viksit or sharir chauras hota he
 Ovum holometabolus and hypermetabolus is an inhomogeneous condition of insects
 dimbh jab andey se nikalate he, tab bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke anusaar unke parivardhan kii dashaayen bhinn-bhinn ho sakati hai
 Their condition depends to some extent on the amount of yoke, which is present in the egg for their growth
 praaia: aisa dekha gaya he ki jab andey main yoke kii maatra kam hoti he, tab andey se nikalate samay dimbh adhik apurna hota he
 There are four types of ovum, protopods are found in the GV appendages on the ovum, because their eggs have a small amount of yoke
 ye dimbh lagbhag bhruneey avasthaa main hi hote hai
 It is possible to survive because they live either in the eggs of other insects or within their bodies, where they get highly nutritious food to grow
 inke udar main khand yaa kisi prakaar ke avyav nahin paae jate hai
 Polypods or erusiform columns also have clear segments in the body and components on the abdomen
 shringikas or vidyaman hoti hai, kintu choti hoti hai
 They live near their food and are lazy for this reason
 aise dimbh illi kehalaate hai or titliyon, shalbhon tathaa safilaise main paae jate hai
 The thoracic components of oligopod eggs are well developed, but no other components are found in the abdomen other than the caudal component
 ye maansaahaari hote hai or shikaar kii khoj main ghoomte phirte hai
 Due to these active lives, their eyes and other senses develop well
 ye dimbh sthal par rahane vaale kanchukapakshon or jaalpakshon main paae jate hai
 The apodus ovum consists of a worm shape
 inaki taange bahut choti hoti hai yaa purnataya lupt ho jaati hai
 They are found in many community insects, such as domestic fly's eggs
 dimbh avasthaa ke ant ke nikat keet roopaantar kii taiyaari karata he or nishchit roopaantar hone ke purv kii dasha main aa jaataa he
 In this case the insect stops eating
 sharir bahut sikud jaataa he or uskaa rang nasht ho jaataa he
 After the prupupa condition, the body shape of the insect changes
 bhavishya main hone vaale praudh ke netra or taangon ke bahya vikson ke chihn pratham baar drushtigochar hote hai
 Often a koya is formed at this stage
 dwipakshon main isi avasthaa main pupa kaa khol banataa he
 In the condition of pupa, the insect rests
 isi avasthaa main paksh tathaa anya avyav apane adhicharm kii theliyon se baahar nikal aate hai or pratyaksh ho jate hai
 The internal senses are reconstructed according to the needs of the future pests
 praathmik prakaar kaa pupa decticas pupa kehalaata he
 Its components do not stick to its body, but it can move
 machhar ke pupa jalawaasi hai or chapaltaa se tairte rahete hai
 The sides and legs of the obtect ie the poached pupa stick to the body
 inamen pragati nahin hoti
 These types of punas are mostly found in moths
 coarctate pupa main dimbh kii antim kentul kaa patan nahin hota he, kintu yahi kentul kadi banakar pupa ke baahar puparium ban jaati he
 This type of pupa is found in domestic fly
 puparium se nikalate samay keet apane khol kaa vibhinn prakaar se todate he
 Chew-eating insects come out of their jaws by muttering their puparium
 chuskar bhojan karanevaale keet ek taral padaarth kaa utsarjan karte hai, jo koya ke resham ko ek ore se komal kar detaa he or is kaaran sahaj main hi tut jaataa he
 Some scales have thorns on the sides, from which they form cracks in the puparium
 kuch dwipakshon ke sir par ek thili hoti hai, jisamen vaayu bharkar ve puparium ke sire ko dabaate hai
 In this way, this end breaks and the fly comes out
 puparium se nikalate samay keet sabase pehle apane avyavon ko baahar nikaalata he
 At this time, its legs shrink, then creep, it rests in whatever condition it finds closest to it
 pakshon main sharir ke raktapravaah se or peshiyon ke sikudne tathaa failane se paksh bhi shighrata se fail jate hai
 Shortly after leaving the puparium, the insect begins to fly
 purnakit kaa parivardhan apurna roopantaranwale kiton main purnakit ke parivardhan main parivartan kramik or rnivighn hote hai
 They are both external and internal
 rnif kii indriyaan purnakit kii indriyon main parivartit ho jaati he
 Apart from the increase in its size, there are very few other changes
 purna roopantaranwale kiton main dimbhon kii indriyaan or utak pupa kii avasthaa main vibhinn maatra main vilay ho jate hai
 This method is called histolysis
 saath hi saath unke sthaan main praudh kii indriyaan ban jaati hai
 This production of new tissues is called histogenesis
 donon prakaar ke parivartan indriyon kii avicchinnata ko nasht kiye bina hi saath-saath hote rahete hai
 In fact, the making of a full-blown starts in the ovum itself
 sabase pehle purnakit kii kalikas banati hai
 These buds reconstruct all the parts of the future insect that will need it, and also make all those senses which are not found in the egg
 dypaj arthath vruddhi kii roak-anukool paristhitiyon main bahut se kiton kaa parivardhan rnivighn hota rahata he
 In the meantime, if any adverse conditions occur, such as low temperature; So the additions stop for some time, but as soon as the situation improves, the additions begin immediately
 kintu bahut se aise keet bhi hai jinamein bahya dashaayen to anukool prathit hoti he
 But due to certain circumstances, the addition stops
 vruddhi kii yah rukaawat kuch saptahon se lekar kai varshon tak kii ho sakati he
 In insects of different castes, this period is often different and thus changes are delayed
 kintu ant main yah rukawat jeev ne itihaas kii kisi ek nishchit avasthaa main hi hoti he
 This stage can be of the egg, of the incomplete insect, or of the adult, and depends on the species of the insect
 resham k krimi shalab, bambiks morai jo andey sharad ri tu main detaa he unamem dypose hota he
 As long as they are not kept at their centigrade before giving warmth, these eggs do not come off
 samshitoshna or sheethal deshon ke kiton ke jeevanchakra main sheetkaal main sheetanishkriyata pai jaati he
 These days the insect remains lax
 ayanvrutt ke deshon main, jahaan kii jalwaayu sadaa ushn or nam hoti he, kiton ke jeevachakra main sheetanishkriyata praaia: nahin pai jaati or ek peedi ke pashchaat duusari peedi krmanusaar aa jaati he
 Shalabh, which penetrates the root of the reed in Indian moths, becomes dormant in the first week of December and begins to be pupa in March
 pepilio demoliyas naamak titali pupa avasthaa main or pit barre praudhavastha main sheetanishkriy hote hai
 The life cycle of periodical cicida, which is found in North America, takes from thirteen to seventeen years to complete, but there are many drumuca that have a generation complete in about a week
 sabase chota jeevanchakra nanhen nanhen calcid naamak kalapaksh ke kiton kaa hota he
 The eggs of these insects are like parasites within the eggs of other insects and their life cycle is completed in only seven days
 bahut se keet sangitajna hote hai
 Moths are speechless, so their music is musical instrument
 ye keval praudhavastha main hi apana vaadya jaanate he
 Often, the male insect probably produces music to attract the female
 inke vaadya adhiktar dhol ke aakaar ke hote he, arthath in vaadyon main ek jhilli hoti he jisamen teevr kampan hone se dhwani utpann hoti he
 There are two methods of generating vibration
 ek bhaag ko duusare bhaag par ragadkar jo dhwani utpann kii jaati he
 Can compare it to the sound emanating from Bella
 duusari vidhi main keet kii peshiyon kaa sankochan vimochan hota he
 These muscles are attached to the membrane and hence the membrane also vibrates
 is prakaar se dhwani utpann karne kaa manushya ke paas koi saadhan nahin he
 Jhingur, katydid, grasshopper and cicada are members of the famous choir of insects
 jheengur, katedid or tidde ek hi gana ke antargat aate hai
 On one front side of the beetles and catechids, there is a plank similar to the sand, which rubs the part of the other forearm which becomes thicker towards the edge
 katedid main reti baayein paksh par hoti he
 Some beetles use their right-sided sand
 tidde ke pakshon par daate hote hai or pichhali taangon par bheetar kii ore tej kinaaraa hota he
 There is an oval hole on the back of the cicada on both sides behind the sides, on which a membrane remains
 is prakaar ek dhol sa ban jaataa he
 On this membrane, the inner muscles are attached, which produces vibration in it
 dhol main tiliyaan hoti he
 The number of these matchsticks varies among different castes
 machhar do prakaar kaa gaan karte hai, jo premgaan or laalsagon kehalaate hai
 a female gives a message to other females by lusting that she has found a prey to suck blood and they can suck blood there
 premgaan nar ko maithun karne ke liye aakarshith karata he
 The life of a large number of insects depends on flora
 lagbhag prayek prakaar kaa paudha or uskaa prayek bhaag kisi na kisi jati ke keet kaa bhojan ban jaataa he
 It is estimated that about fifty percent of insects do their subsistence from plants
 tiddiyaan or tidde khule main rahakar lagbhag prayek paudha kha jate hai
 Many species of moths, ovaries, saucers and thorns also eat almost every part of the plant, either in the open or hiding it
 ye pattey, stambh, jad tathaa kashtha ke bheetar rahakar bhi apana bhojan paa jaati hai
 Jhalaripaksha, Drumayuka and other makuna of plants suck the juice by piercing it
 bahut se shalab, madhumakhiyaan tathaa inke sambandhi pushpasrav chuusate hai
 Some insects transform the tissue of plants into a strange type of composition, which is called thrush
 in rachanaaon main keet ke dimbhon ko aashray tathaa bhojan miltaa he
 Each plant nurtures many species of insects
 do sau jati ke keet makai par, chaar sau jati ke seb par tathaa ek sau pachaas se adhik jatiyon ke keet chid ke vriksh par nirvaah karte paae gaye hai
 Often, insects of different species are found on different parts of the tree and thus to some extent remain from competition
 bahut se keet apana purna jivan ek hi paudhe par vyateet karte hai
 Insects that live inside the leaves, holes inside the plants, and insect-forming insects live their lives in this way
 inkaa paudhon main pravesh karnaa paudhe kii vishesh dasha par nirbhar rahata he
 Many pests attack many plants, or plants of several species of the same class
 saadharantaya prayek jati ke keet kaa paudha nirdhaarit rahata he, tathaa anek keet nirdhaarit jati ke paudhon ke atirikt kisi anya paudhe ko nahin khate, chaahe unki mrityu bhale hi ho jaae
 Many pests and plants are interrelated
 aise keet paraag or makrand praapt karne ke liye pushpon par jate hai
 While receiving these items, they wreath in ignorance
 pushpon se bhojan praapt karne vaale kiton main praaia: vishesh prakaar kii rachanaayen pai jaati hai
 These compositions help in sucking up Makarandaka from very deep mukarandakoshas
 karmkaari madhumakhiyon main paraag ko ekatra karne ke liye pichhali taangon par paraag daliyaan hoti hai
 The flowers also have color and aroma to attract pests
 kuch pushpon kii rachana aisi hoti he ki keet bina paraag ekatra kiye makrand praapt kar hi nahin saktaa or jab vah duusare pushp par jaataa he to pushp kii rachana ke kaaran iske vartikagra par paraag giraae bina makrandkosh tak pahunch hi nahin saktaa
 Yucca flower and yucca shalabh are very beautiful examples of this
 jo keet vanaspati nahin khate, ve ucchhisht vastuon, anya kiton yaa anya jeevon ko apana bhojan banaate hai
 The cleaning insects live their lives on other abandoned items like garbage, etc
 sadi gali vanaspatiyon se bahut se kanchukpaksh, makkhiyaan tathaa anya keet aashray tathaa bhojan pate hai
 Dung, rotting carcasses of animals and their remains become food of some insect
 kiton kii ye kritiyaan manushya ke liye bahut laabhadaayak hai

 Their prey is any other insect, or invertebrate
 aise jivan ke kaaran in kiton kii taangon, mukh bhaagon or samvedak indriyon main bahut se parivartan ho jate hai
 In the behavior of some such insects, obvious changes are also visible
 kuch keet apni taangon kaa apane shikaar ko pakadaney tathaa bhakshan karte samay thaamne ke liye upyog karte hai
 Huntsman kites use their three pairs of legs, and only watery legs and mantids are used in this work
 is kaaran inaki taangon main parivartan paaya jaataa he
 The jaws of the disticus are pointed and forward to catch their prey
 vyadhapatang ke ninf kaa oshth anya kiton ke pakadaney ke liye vishesh akruti kaa ban jaataa he
 The combined eyes of these insects are particularly developed
 kuch apahari kiton kii taange daudane ke liye upyukt hoti hai or kuch tivrata se ud sakate hai
 Many cripples lay their eggs in contact with their prey, such as the lady-bird beetle lays its eggs near Drumayuca
 anek apahari apane shikaar kii pratiksha main chhipe baithe rahete hai or jaise hi unka shikaar unki pahunch main aata he, us par ekbargi jhapata maarthe hai, jaise mantis main apane ko gupt rakhane ke liye pattee jaisaa rang hota he
 Some of the waterway poles make a pit to catch their prey, ants
 paraseete ve keet hai jo anya jeevon par nirvaah to karte hai, kintu unka vadh kiye bina hi unase bhojan praapt karte hai or praaia: ek hi poshak par nirbhar rahete hai
 They often lay their eggs on their nutritious body
 paraseete keet do prakaar ke hote hai-ek jo kasheru k dandiyon par or duusare jo anya kiton tathaa unke sambandhiyon par jivit rahete hai
 The first class insects are the genus Anoplura, Malophaga and Cyphonaptera and belong to the Hippobosidae lineage
 ye paraseete apane poshak kii tulana main bahut chote hote hai
 The power to bear them develops in the nutrient and due to this their effect is not fatal
 inamen se adhiktar pahya paraseete hai or poshak ke sharir par rahete hai
 Apart from Cyphonaptera, the body of others is flattened from the top down and they stick to the body of the nutrient
 inke pairon par poshak ko pakade rahane ke liye hook hote hai tathaa netra ksheen yaa lupt ho jate hai
 The sides are also often lacking and even if they are, they are very small
 kiton ke paraseete ine gine hi hai
 Apart from Strepsiptus gana, the bee lice, breula, are only other examples
 ardh paraseete kaa vyavhaar apahari or paraseete ke madhya kaa sa hota he
 Initially it remains like a parasite, that is, it does not destroy the nutrient's much-needed senses, but later it behaves like a parasitic and it devours its nutrient
 yah praaia: apane andey poshak ke sharir ke upar yaa bheetar rakhata he
 Its eggs stick to the nutrient permanently and get their food from inside or outside the nutrient body
 adhiktar ye keet dwipaksh vansh kii texnidi or kalapaksh ke paracitica varg main hi paae jate hai
 Their adults are functional and not parasitic
 ardhparasite kaa aakaar poshak ke aakaar kii tulana main bada hota he or yah apane vyavhaar se poshak ko praaia: sadaa hi nasht kar detaa he
 Nutrients are mostly other pests, whose parasites are invaded by eggs or other unhygienic conditions
 praudh keet par kabhi bhi akraman nahin hota
 Pests of the Tachinidi lineage live within the nutrient, but lay the eggs above the nutrient, or away from the nutrient
 bahut se parashrayi kalapaksh bahya parashriton kii bhanti rahete hai, kintu adhiktar aantarik parashrayi hai or apane andey poshak kii twachaa ke bheetar pravisht kar dete hai

 kintu kuch aantarik ardhparasite aise bhi hai
 Which receive oxygen directly from the atmosphere
 kuch keet duusare kiton kaa to bhakshan nahin karte, kintu unki ekatra kii hui saamagree ko kha jate hai

 Locusts and butterflies become gregarious during migration
 helictus naamak ekaaki makshika bhoomi main bani hui surang ke mukh ke chaaron or nanhen-nanhen kamare banaati hai
 They keep food and eggs in these rooms, after which they keep protecting them
 yah us samay tak jivit bhi rah jaati hai jab tak andon se makshikaaye nikal na aaen
 That insect, which takes care of its offspring at least early in their life, can be said to be the first class of social life
 bhinn-bhinn virgon ke samjik kiton main bhinn-bhinn vilakshantaayen drushtigochar hoti hai, kintu inaki prayek mandali kaa sabase mahatvapurn lakshan yah hai ki ek hi kutub hota he, jisamen ek nar, ek maadaa or unki santan, yaa ek ganbhat maadaa or uski santan, arthath kam se kam do peediyaan ek hi sthaan par hi mil julkar rahati hai
 Real social life is found in jumbo, bees, ants and termites
 
 There is another type of symbiosis in which an insect sticks to the body of another insect
 jin kiton ke sharir par chipakate hai ve praaia: bade hote hai, kintu chota keet unako khaataa nahin hai, arthath koi haani nahin pahunchaata
 The triangulins of the Miloidei dynasty carry the ovum in their mosses on their bodies

 The oily secretion comes out from the glands found around the esophagus in the mosquito poles
 iske kaaran in sthanon ke bahyatvak main jalasantrasic gun aa jaataa he or vahaan jal thahar nahin paata
 Therefore, respiration continues uninterrupted
 kuch kiton, jaise paudura acvatika main aise bal hote hai jinke kaaran bahyatvak jalasantrasic ho jaataa he
 Due to this property, water cannot enter the respiratory tract
 inamen bhojan praapt karne ke liye bhi vishesh saadhan hote hai, yatha-odineta ke ninfon main labium kaa ghunghat ek jaal kaa kaary karata he
 There are vibrating burruses in the mouths of mosquito eggs which produce waves in the water and thus the microorganisms of the food reach their esophagus
 dietiscus kii pichhali taange patavaar ke aakar kii ho jaati hai
 Notonecta and Dietiscus run both of their hulls together while swimming, but Hydrophilus runs his last leg shift
 jirinus naamak kanchukpaksh madhya or pasch taangon se, jinamein bahut parivartan aa jaataa he, tivrata se chakkar lagaate hue ghumta or tairta he

 Paksha is a composition of great importance
 pakshon ke kaaran kiton main athulit vitaransamarthy aa jaataa he, jo anya sthaliy jeevon main nahin paaya jaataa
 The power of distribution gives each species of insects the freedom to survive the intense competition and the impact of rigorous election, which results in excessive congestion in the finite area, but there are many insects whose distribution is limited
 saare sansar main manushyon ke gharon main paae janevaale kiton main telchatta, chaaval kaa suundwala keet, daalon ke keet aadi prasiddh he
 Apart from these, gram flour, potato moth, sweet potato dill and cabbage moth are also found all over the world
 isi prakaar aise bhi bahut se keet hai jo kisi vishesh pradesh yaa desh main hi paae jate hai
 Such distribution depends on many circumstances
 bhojanprapti or prakritik dashaaen nihsandeh bahut adhik prabhaavshaalee paristhitiyaan hai
 Waterborne pests cannot live where there is no water
 vrikshon kii chaal main rahane vaale keet un sthanon main nahin paae ja sakate jahaan vriksh hi na ho
 Natural barriers, such as high mountains, sea and desert, do not allow pests to be distributed from one country to another
 kuch keet, jaise safilise, bandgobhi kii titali aadi samshitoshna katibandh main hi paae jate hai
 Fruit flies, paddy pests etc
 are found only in the epoch
 kuch kiton main jaise tiddiyon or kuch titliyon main, kabhi-kabhi pravajan kii pravriti hoti he or ye sudur deshon tak pahanch jate hai
 But the modern distribution of many insects cannot be interpreted on the basis of the modern state of the earth and climate and therefore often has to resort to geological changes
 spring tail naamak keet newjiland or chile main paaya jaataa he
 From this, it can be inferred that the atactic continent was spread between these two countries at some time, because this insect is so soft and unbiased that it cannot be distributed in any other way
 spring tail kaa anya kiton kii tulana main sabase adhik vistrut vitaran he or is kaaran isane apane ko in vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anukool bana liya he
 Ants are also distributed in almost the same way and they have adapted themselves to different circumstances
 da biar, ne san 1954-55 main yah batalaaya ki miriapoda ke jo dimbh dimbhavstha main janan kar saken unako hi kiton kaa purvaj maananaa chahie
 To prove this, it is important to compare the adult of insects and some of the bones of Miriapoda, for example, that of Aeulus, a millipede
 aiulas kaa dimbh jab andey se nikalataa he, iskaa sir utane hi khandon kaa bana maaloom hota he jitne khandon kaa kiton kaa sir
 The rest of the body consists of about 12 segments, of which the first three segments each have a pair of legs
 chauthaa tathaa inke pechhevaale khand bhi bina taangon ke nahin hote
 But their growth is hindered and they remain very small
 is prakaar yah chah taangon vaala aiulas kaa dimbh ant main lanbaa praudh ban jaataa he, jiske sharir main bahut se khand or bahut si taange hoti he
 If the growth of the legs after the first three pairs of this egg is more hindered and about 12 sections of the body of the egg persist in adulthood, then this organism will be insect-shaped, with the legs behind the first three pairs of legs being either so weak
 That only their remains will be or they will be completely lost
 yah baat bahut hi rochak he ki vastav main aise keet hai jinamein udar par bhi taangon ke avshesh vartmaan hote hai, jaise campodia, jepix or machilis 
 These insects do not have favors, and they contain compositions that have disappeared from other insects, such as gonation of the gonads
 isliye kiton ke vikaas main in kiton ko miriapoda ke dimbhavstha main janane vaale dimbhon or anya kiton kii madhyavaali dasha kaa samajhnaa chahie
 It is also approved by many other arguments that insects originated from figures like Miriyapoda
 atyadhik sambhaavna yah he ki un sab lambey sharir or tongowale jeevon main miriapoda hi kiton ke purvaj hai, kyonki in main kai rachanaayen ek-si hoti hai udaahranarth, malepigian nalikaay or trekial nalikaay
 But it should also be noted that the insects could not have originated from the adult myriapoda, as they have many characteristics and characteristics
 epterigota upvarg adhiktar vividh prakaar ke kiton kaa ek samooh he or us upvarg kaa keval thisaneura gana hi terrigot kiton kii vikasawali mukhya shrenee ke sambhavat: sameep he
 It has been proved by logic that the remaining three gonas of Apertigota should not be considered insects
 kintu aisa koi santoshjanak kaaran prathit nahin hota he, jisase in teenon ganon ko is upvarg se pruthak kar diya jaae, yadhyapi isamen koi andeh nahin ki ye vilakshan rachanaayen pradarshit karte hai, udaahranarth colembola gana ke kiton main keval nau khand hi hote hai
 Anemorphosis occurs in the pests of the protura gana, the diplora, asymptomatic tracheal system found in the pests of gana, the muscles in the flagellum of the genus Dipura and colombala
 upvarg terrigota do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he-exopterigota or endopterigota 
 Exopterigota Ganes have a close relationship between Epimeraptra and Odoneta, as they are both palaepteron, Ganes
 yadi aadhunik kiton ke sharir ke siddhant se vichaar kiya jaay to blatteria, mantodia, isoptera, joreptra, gailoblattodia, ri jupaj, phesemida, plicoptera, dermaptra or ambioptra ri jupakshika orthoptred, samudaay ke antargat aate hai
 All of these properties form a community due to the following characteristics — unchanged mouthpiece, a pair of mustard on the posterior end of the giant anel lobe in the posterior, numberless malipagian tubules and several distinct tufts in the peritoneal nerve
 in ganon main se blatteria or mantodia main bahut adhik nikat sambandh hone ke kaaran in donon ko saath-saath dicteoptera ke antargat rakhte hai
 The remaining ganas of Exopterigota, namely Socoptera, Malophaga, Cyphanculata, Matkungana and Jallaripaksha, belong to the Matkunganik community
 matkunaganik samudaay ke lakshan is prakaar he: vishesh prakaar ke mandibulate yaa chusanevaale mukhbhaag hote hai, pashchapaksh main anelle lob nahin paaya jaataa, sarasai kaa abhaav hota he
 The number of malpigian tubules is very small, and the peritoneal nerves are almost collected
 ri jupakshik or matkunaganik samudaayon main spasht bhed nahin hai, kyonki joreptra main pakshon kii shirayen kuch ksheen ho jaati he, mailipigiyan nalikaaon kii sankhya bhi kam hoti he or tantrikatantu kii gucchhikaaye bhi kuch kuch ekatribhoot ho jaati he
 There seems to be a clear relationship between Socoptera and Malophaga, as both have eccentric types of hypopharyx
 sambhavat: simonculeta mellophayga se nikat sambandh rakhte hai
 With them, they not only have an analogy in many external and internal creations and nature, but there is also an analogy in the composition of the breath and the process of hatching
 ab prashn yah uthta he ki junon ke donon ganon ko ek hi gana ke antargat kyon nahin mana jaataa
 The reason for this is that there is so much difference between the faces of the two ganas
 ki inkaa pruthak pruthak ganon main rakhana hi praaia: uchit samajha jaataa he
 Considering Indopterygote pests, there is an extreme difficulty in keeping Kalapaksa, Strepsiptera and Kanchukapaksa with other Ganas, hence the rest of them are kept under Panorpid community
 panorapid samudaay jaalpaksh neuroptra ke saath micoptera par kendribhoot he or kuch kuch pruthak kintu sambandhi shakha banaata he
 It is more likely that the lower members of the Mikaptera originated on the one side as the bipartite and on the other side the Salki Paksha and Lomapaksha
 cyphonaptera ke praudhon kii rachana bahut bhinn hoti hai, kintu iske dimbh dwipaksh ke upagan nimetocera ke kuch dimbhon se bhinn nahin hote or yadi cyphonaptera kii utpatti aadi dwipakshon se na hui ho to kam se kam panorapid samudaay se to hui hi hogi
 There also seems to be some difficulty in the subject of acupuncture, ejaculate and strepsiptera
 kalapaksh ke upagan simphyta ke dimbh or panorapid kiton ke dimbhon main sadashya he, saath hi saath simphyta ke pakshon kii shira kii utpatti bina kisi kathinata ke, megacoptaran pattern se prathit hoti he
 For these two reasons it is also said that the ancestor of Kalapaksha and ancestors of jalapaksha and other panorpid villages were the same
 kanchuk paksh ke vishay main aisa vichaar he ki inaki utpatti anya indopterigot se bhinn rup main hui
 But some authors speculate that the origin of the Kanchukapaksha originated from the ancestors with a nettle shape
 strepciptera praaia: kanchukpaksh se sambandhit samajhe jate hai, kintu kuch lekhak inkaa sambandh kalapaksh ke nirdhaarit karte hai

 Below this are seven Hades
 atal unamem se pehla he
 The term logic is a translation of the English 'logic'
 pracheen bhartiya darshan main is prakaar ke namwala koi shaastra prasiddh nahin he
 Logic was not born as an independent scripture in Indian philosophy
 akshapaad! gautam yaa gautam kaa nyayasutra pehla granth he, jisamen tathakthith tarkshastra kii samasyaon par vyavasthit dhang se vichaar kiya gaya he
 a large part of the above sutras considers these problems, yet in the said book, this subject has been represented as part of philosophy
 nyaayadarshan main solah pareekshaneey padaarthon kaa ullekh he
 Among them, the first evidence is the subject or substance of the name
 vastutah bhartiya darshan main aaj ke tarkshastra kaa sthanapann 'pramanshastra' kaha ja saktaa he
 But the content of the certificate is more elaborate than logic
 europe main tarkshastra kaa pravartak evam pratishthata unani darshanik arestu samajha jaataa he, yon usase pehle katipay tarkshastreey samasyaon par vaitandic shikshakon, sucraat tathaa aflatoon yaa plato dwaara kuch chintan hua tha
 It is interesting that Aristotle himself, who for the first time in the history of ideas, divided knowledge into different branches, is not familiar with the name 'logic'
 usne apni etadvishyak vichaarna ko 'enelytics' naam se abhihit kiya he
 The first use of the logic word 'lajika' is found in the Roman writer Cicero, though there is a different meaning
 arestu ke anusaar tarkshastra kaa vishay chintan he, na ki chintan ke vaahak shabdpratik
 The following topics are mainly presented in his logical texts: vaakya padon se banataa he
 Each verse indicates certain objects and also signifies certain qualities or characteristics
 vastusanket kii visheshta pad kaa 'dinotesan' kehalaati he, sanketit swarupaprakashak gunon ko samshti rup main 'conotesan' kehete hai, jaise 'manushya' pad kaa dinotesan 'sab manushya' he, uskaa conotesan 'praanitiv' tathaa 'buddhisampannatv' he
 Each sentence has an objective term, a predicate term and a valence connecting them
 vidhey pad kai shreniyon ke hote hai, kuch uddeshy kaa swaroop-kathan karanevaale, kuch uski bahari visheshtaon ko batalaanevaale
 The classification of predicate terms has a close relationship with Aristotle's definitional ideas
 vaakyon yaa kathanon kaa vargeekaran bhi kai prakaar hota he; arthath gun, pariman, sambandh or nishchayaatmakataa ke anusaar
 The sentence catagorical by relation; Hetuetmud; And are disjunctive
 nishchayatmakataa ke anusaar kathanaatmak, sambhavya or nishchayatmak teen prakaar ke hote hai
 The major form of the sentence is 'catagorical'
 vaise vaakyon kaa vargeekaran gun tathaa pariman ke anusaar hota he
 Four types of sentences are available by classification, corresponding to the types of properties and quantities, which are indicated by the Roman letters - A, E, I, O
 vidheyatmak sarv sambandhi vidhayak or nishedh vaakya kii sangya e or i he,jaise 'sabhi manushya purna he' or 'koi manushya purna nahin he'; kuch sambandhi vidhayak or nishedhak vaakya kramshah ai va o kahate he; yatha - 'kuch manushya shikshit hai' or 'kuch manushya shikshit nahin he
 ' arestu ke tarkshastra kaa pradhan pratipaadya vishay nyayavakyon main vyakt kiye janevaale anumaan he; sahi anumaan 19 prakaar ke hote hai jo chaar tarah kii avyavsanhatiyon main prakashit kiye jate hai
 The four types of justice sentence components are called 'figures' and the correct approximations found in them are called 'moods'
 ye 'mood' duusari 'figuron' se pehali 'figure' ke roopon main parivartit kiye ja sakate hai
 The first figure is considered the most complete figure
 bhartiya darshan main, jaisaa upar kaha gaya, jis cheez kaa vikaas hua, vah pramanshastra he; tathakthith tarkshastra uskaa ek bhaag maatr he
 In Gautama's 'nyasutra', the specific or primary cause producing prama or real knowledge is called 'evidence'; Their number is four, namely, direct, inference, subhuman and word
 bhatt mimasakon or vedantiyon ke anusaar pramaan chah hai, arthath upyukt chaar tathaa arthpatti va anuplabdhi
 There has been a lot of thinking and controversy in the Indian epistemology about the above evidences
 baudhon, naiyayikon, vedantiyon aadi ke dwaara kiya hua pratyaksh kaa vishleshan vishesh rup main unke apane-apane tatvamimasaa sambandhi vichaaron se prabhavit he
 According to justice, there are two types of estimation, altruism and self prediction
 anumaan ke bodhak nyayavakya main paanch vaakya hote hai jo kramshah pratigya, hetu, udhaaharan, upanay tathaa nigaman kehalaate hai
 According to the Vedanti, three sentences starting from these five or later are sufficient for inference
 buddha tarkshastri dharmakirti ke mat main trirup arthath teen visheshtaon se yukt ling yaa hetu hi anumaan kaa kaaran he
 These three characteristics are - permissible or fixed presence in favor; Presence in the sapaksha itself; And a definite absence in the opposition or opposition
 yahan parvat paksh he, jahaan dhooma kii upasthiti se agni kaa anumaan kiya jaataa he; rasoighar sapaksh he, jahaan hi anishchit upasthiti ke saath dhooma kii upasthiti vidit he, jahaan agni ke saath dhooma kii anupasthiti nishchit he
 Next we will use the term 'logic' in its narrow, modern sense
 is arth ke daayre main tarkshastra kii paribhaasha kya hogi? jaan stuart mil ke mat main tarkshastra kaa vishay anumitiyaan hai, na ki anubhavgamya satya
 Logic is not a science of beliefs, it is not a science of evidence or evidence
 tarkshastra kaa kshetra hamaare gyaan kaa vah ansh he, jiskaa rup 'purvagyaat satyon se anumit' hota he
 The task of logic is not to collect evidence of any truth, it is an attempt to assess whether appropriate evidence has been presented for any permission
 sankshep main tarkshastra kaa kaam sahi anumiti ke aadhaaron kii khoj he
 Knowledge of logic generates the ability for us to see and assess that evidence is not the evidence of a truth, it is an attempt to assess whether a permission is only a memorandum of deterministic basis, that is, its subject is the relationship of deterministic permissions and fundamental evidence
 Explain or expose the rules that govern the correct estimation process
 isliye kabhi kabhi kaha jaataa he ki tarkshastra ek niamak vigyaan yaa shaastra he, jiskaa kaary anumiti yaa tark ke adarsh roopon ko sthir karnaa he
 In contrast, Physics or Physics, Economics, Sociology etc
 are real science, which explore the real or real forms or rules of the object
 vigyaanon kaa yah vargeekaran kuch had tak bhraamak he
 Logic or ethics is regulatory science, this statement can be interpreted that the above scriptures artificially dictate the rules of human behavior in the field, as if the rules of right thinking and right moral behavior are not private laws of human nature but outside it There are rules to be dealt with
 kintu baat aisi nahin he
 In fact, logic is just a tool for directing those rules, which are considered to be automatic, by nature, in the right thinking forms
 vichaarsheel manushya swatah, swabhaavatah sahi or galat chintan main, nirdosh evam sadosh tarkna- prakaaron main antar karte hai
 But by making such a distinction, they do not reveal the absence or consciousness of any regulatory ideals or laws
 sahi samajhe janevaale tarkna prakaaron kaa vishleshan karke unamem anusyut niyamon ko sachet jaankaree ke dharaatal par laana, yahi tarkshastra kaa kaam he
 In the same way, ethics also informs us about the rules or ideals, which are inadvertently, in our judgments of good and bad
 isiilie kaha jaataa he ki vishisht aachaar paddati, athwa kisi samaaj kii acharsanhita tathaa naitik shiksha, us samaaj ke naitik pakshapaaton ko prakashit karti he
 In this sense, moral thinkers of country, age or society are representative thinkers of their country, era or society
 tarkshastra ke sambandh main ukt manyata se ek mahatvapurn nishkarsh anugat hota he
 If due to any reason there is a change or development in the thinking system or logic of man, then there can be change or development in the philosophical mind as well
 tarkshastra ke itihaas main aisa bhi hota he ki kalantar main chintan ke puraane mandandon yaa niyamon main sanshodhan aavashyak ho jaataa he; nae chintanaprakaaron kii sristi ke saath saath naveen tarkshastreey niyamon kaa nirupan bhi apekshit ho saktaa he
 In Europe, when the progress of physics began, there was also criticism and appreciation of Aristotle's incorporation system and the advent of different systems respectively
 europea vaicharik itihaas main is koti kaa kaary lard bekan ne kiya
 Later, as the scientific exploration system was over-analyzed, European logicians developed concepts such as incorporative methodology and hypothesis incorporation systems
 aagamanaatmak tarkshastra main un niyamon kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he, jo nirikshit ghatnaon yaa vyapaaron ke aadhaar par tatsambandhi saamaanya kathano kii uplabdhi yaa nirupan sambhav banaate hai
 Common statements often take the form of passages
 bhartiya pramanshastra main is prashn ko lekar ki vyaptivakya kii uplabdhi kaise hoti he, kaaphi chaanbin kii gai he
 'wherever there is a fire, there is fire' - it is a phrase
 spasht hi hamaare nirikshan main dhooma or agni ke saahchary ke kuch hi udhaaharan aate hai
 The question is, how can we justify imagining their universal and universal association by combining two things monitored in certain situations? This problem is called inductive problem in logic
 pariklpana nigamanpranali is uljhan main pade bina saamaanya kathanon athwa vyaptivakyon kii pramanik prakalpana ke prashn kaa samaadhaan prastut kar detii he
 In short, the system of modern scientific exploration is: upar hamane is baat par bal diya ki nai tarkpranaliyon ke vikaas ke saath saath tarkshastreey siddhanton ke swaroop main bhi newnaadhik parivartan hota he
 In this view, logic is a dynamic discipline; They are not mere compilation or mention of fixed, eternal rules
 vastutah vibhinn bhautik, jaev evam samajashastreey vigyon ke vikaas ne tarkshastra ko bahut prabhavit kiya he
 Today, more than the systems and rules of inference and reasoning, the indiscriminate process of various disciplines has become a special subject of practice
 ukt prakriya kii shastreey jaanch ko reetimimasaa kehete hai
 An explanation of greater importance is required here
 anubhav evam chintan ke vibhinn kshetron main hamaari tarknaprakriya ek hi koti kii nahin hoti
 Methods of reasoning in science and mathematics are of a type
 sahityasamiksha athwa naitik nirnyon ke kshetra main bhi ye tareeke kaaphi bhinn ho jate hai
 In other words, we can say that in the fields of art review, literature epistemology, ethics, etc
, the systems of self-determination and refutation of testers are not the same
 ve kaaphi bhinn bhi ho sakati hai or hoti hai
 This condition is also expressed in the following words: beesvin sadi main paramparaagat arestu ke tarkshastra se bhinn pratik mulak yaa pratikanishtha tarkshastra kaa vikaas hua he
 This is a major incident in the eyes of some testers
 is naye tarkshastra ko ganitnishtha tarkshastra bhi kehete hai
 In the middle of the nineteenth century, two British clergy laid the basis of this new form of logic; These were two mathematicians - Augustus de Margan and George Boole
 inkaa mukhya anveshan yah tha ki arestu ke tarkshastra main jin anumitiyon kaa ullekh he, unamem kahin adhik kotiyon kii pramanik anumitiyaan hai
 The basis of the permissions to be revealed in Aristotle's judgments is the law of class confession
 vaise anumaan kaa prasiddh udhaaharan haih sab manushya maranshil he; yahan sucraat manushya he; isliye sucraat maranshil he yahan maranshiltaa manushya naam ke varg kaa vyapak dharm he; vah us varg main samaveshit sucraat kaa bhi dharm he
 Morgan and Boole find that the real basis of permission is special-order relationships, the rule of class inclusion is intrinsic to one of these many relationships
 atah us niyam ko anumiti kaa swatantra siddhant nahin maananaa chahie
 Secondly, there are many permissions that cannot be disclosed as justices
 udhaaharan- 'k kii avasthaa kha se adhik he or kha kii avasthaa ga se adhik he, isaliye k kii avasthaa ga se adhik he
 The famous philosopher EF00 Bradley has also indicated permissions that cannot be invested in Aristotle's jurisprudence
 upar kaha gaya he ki naveen vichaarkon ke anusaar anumiti kaa aadhaar vaakyon ke bich rahanevaale kuch sambandh hai
 The concept of 'relation' itself is difficult to define
 sambandhon kaa vargeekaran kai tarah se hota he
 Some relationships are between two terms or substances, some three, etc

 Using this scheme to identify the term "zodiac" refers to the Western zodiac for many superficial similarities: both divided into 12 parts of the time cycle, each with at least the majority of those parts in the label, of animals
 The names and the effects of each are widely related with how a culture ascribing a person's personality or events is perceived to be to his or her life, especially the individual's relationship

 The 12 animals are also associated with the traditional Chinese agricultural calendar, which runs, better known, the lunar calendar
 ke bajaay maheene, is calendar main baanta gaya he 24 do saptaah ke kshetron ke rup main janaa jaataa saura shartonhai
 Each animal is attached to two of these solar conditions, similar to the period for the Western month
 In contrast to the 60-year lunar calendar, which can vary as much as one month in relation to the Western calendar, the agricultural calendar varies only from a single western day beginning on February 3 or 4 every year
 Then the lunar year of the opposite cycle, which begins with the rat, begins with the agricultural calendar of the tiger as it first spring of the animal
 Living in the summer days than in the winter days, because it occurs the differences of Neptune and Aphelion

 The same applies for each sign of the fixed element, the year and hour sign, and not just the monthly sign

 The Chinese zodiac is also used to label the time of day, with each signature corresponding to a "big-hour" or shichen, which is a two-hour period

 Since the truest representation of a person may be thought to have been the secret animal, this animal is determined by the smallest denominator: the hour of birth of a person

 To convert to standard time, one needs to add or take away 30 minutes or more, depending on the time zone of the central meridian in a birth place west or east respectively
 The London marking is the standard time equivalent to GMT solar time of the central meridian, but for other cities like Cardiff located 3 ° 11 'W, the time will start at 11 minutes past one hour, while Norwich's 1 ° 17' E

 Within the 'four pillars', the year column purports to provide information about an ancestor's or early age, and the month's column about one's parents or growing age
 Day column offers information about yourself and a spouse or adult age, and about the column of hours or late age
 The first trine consists of the Rat, Dragon and Monkey
 These three signs are said to be intense and powerful individuals capable of great good, who make great leaders but are rather unpredictable

 These three signs are said to possess endurance and application, with slow accumulation of energy, meticulous at planning but tending to hold fixed opinions

 The third trine consists of the Tiger, Horse and Dog
 These three signs are said to seek true love, to pursue humanitarian causes, to be idealistic and independent but tending to be impulsive
 The three are said to be productive, enthusiastic, independent, engaging, dynamic, honourable, loyal and protective, but can also be rash, rebellious, quarrelsome, anxious, disagreeable or stubborn
 The fourth trine consists of the Rabbit, Goat and Pig
 These three signs are said to have a calm nature and an intellectual approach; They seek aesthetic beauty and are artistic, well-mannered and compassionate, yet detached and resigned to their condition
 The three are said to be caring, self-sacrificing, obliging, sensible, creative, empathetic, tactful and prudent, but can also be naïve, pedantic, insecure, cunning, indecisive or pessimistic
 There are many stories and fables to explain the beginning of the zodiac
 Since the Han Dynasty, the 12 Earthly Branches have been used to record the time of day
 However, for the sake of entertainment and convenience, they have been replaced by the 12 animals
 The 24 hours are divided into 12 periods, and a mnemonic refers to the behaviour of the animals: a Branch may refer to a double-hour period
 In the latter case it is the center of the period; for instance, 马 means noon or a period from 11am to 1pm
 An Ancient folk story tells that Cat and Rat were the worst swimmers in the animal kingdom
 Although they were poor swimmers, they were both quite intelligent
 To get to the meeting called by the Jade Emperor, they had to cross a river to reach the meeting place
 The Jade Emperor had also decreed that the years on the calendar would be named for each animal in the order they arrived to the meeting
 Cat and Rat decided that the best and fastest way to cross the river was to hop on the back of Ox
 Ox, being naïve and good-natured, agreed to carry them both across
 Midway across the river, Rat pushed Cat into the water
 Then as Ox neared the other side of the river, Rat jumped ahead and reached the shore first
 So he claimed first place in the competition and the zodiac
 Following closely behind was strong Ox who was named the 2nd animal in the zodiac
 After Ox, came Tiger, panting, while explaining to the Jade Emperor how difficult it was to cross the river with the heavy currents pushing it downstream all the time
 But with its powerful strength, Tiger made to shore and was named the 3rd animal in the cycle
 Suddenly, from a distance came a thumping sound, and the Rabbit arrived
 It explained how it crossed the river: by jumping from one stone to another in a nimble fashion
 Halfway through, it almost lost the race, but the Rabbit was lucky enough to grab hold of a floating log that later washed him to shore
 For that, it became the 4th animal in the Zodiac cycle
 In 5th place was the Flying Dragon
 Of course, the Jade Emperor was deeply curious as to why a swift flying creature such as the Dragon should fail to reach first place
 The mighty Dragon explained that he had to stop and make rain to help all the people and creatures of the earth, and therefore he was held back
 Then, on his way to the finish, he saw a little helpless Rabbit clinging onto a log so he did a good deed and gave a puff of breath to the poor creature so that it could land on the shore
 The Jade Emperor was very pleased with the actions of the Dragon, and he was added into the zodiac cycle
 As soon as he had done so, a galloping sound was heard, and the Horse appeared
 Hidden on the Horse's hoof was the Snake, whose sudden appearance gave the Horse a fright, thus making it fall back and giving the Snake the 6th spot, while the Horse placed 7th
 Not long after that, a little distance away, the Goat, Monkey, and Rooster came to the shore
 These three creatures helped each other to get to where they are
 The Rooster spotted a raft, and took the other two animals with it
 Together, the Goat and the Monkey cleared the weeds, tugged and pulled and finally got the raft to the shore
 Because of their combined efforts, the Emperor was very pleased and promptly named the Goat as the 8th creature, the Monkey as the 9th, and the Rooster the 10th
 The 11th animal was the Dog
 Although he was supposed to be the best swimmer, he could not resist the temptation to play a little longer in the river
 Though his explanation for being late was because he needed a good bath after a long spell
 For that, he almost didn't make it to the finish line
 Just as the Jade Emperor was about to call it a day, an oink and squeal was heard from a little Pig
 The Pig got hungry during the race, promptly stopped for a feast and then fell asleep
 After the nap, the Pig continued the race and was named the 12th animal of the zodiac cycle
 The cat drowned in 13th place and did not make it in the zodiac
 It is said that is the reason why cats always chase Rats; to get back at them for what they have done
 Another folk story tells that on registration day, the Rat met up with the Ox
 He thought to himself "ox is the fastest, strongest animal!" So the little Rat played a trick on the Ox
 He asked the Ox if he would like to listen to him sing
 The Rat opened his mouth but said nothing
 "how was that?" he asked the Ox and of course he replied "sorry little Rat, i did not hear you
" The Rat told the Ox to let him jump onto his back so that he could sing it more clearly, and the Ox agreed
 Soon without knowing, the Ox was walking to the signing post, forgetting the Rat on his back
 When they reached there, the Rat jumped off and claimed first place
 The Ox following and the rest
 In Buddhism, legend has it that Buddha summoned all of the animals of the earth to come before him before his departure from this earth, but only 12 animals actually came to bid him farewell
 To reward the animals who came to him, he named a year after each of them
 The years were given to them in the order they had arrived
 The 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac must have been developed in the early stages of Chinese civilization over hundreds of years before it became the current edition; and it's very hard to investigate the real origin
 Most historians agree that Cat is not in the list since the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac were formed before cats were introduced to China from India with Buddhism
 Another story tells that God called the animals to a banquet that night
 The Rat, who loved to play tricks on his neighbor, told the cat that the banquet was on the day after tomorrow
 The cat believed his neighbour the Rat and slept whilst dreaming of the banquet
 The next day, the Rat arrived first followed by the Ox, the Tiger and the rest of the animals
 The order of the animals was decided by the order that they arrived
 The cat was devastated and vowed that he would always hate the Rat
 This is why cats chase Rats in folklore
 Due to confusion with synonyms during translation, some of the animals depicted by the English words did not exist in ancient China
 For example, 羊 can mean ram, sheep or Goat
 Like, 鼠 can also be written as mouse, as there are no distinctive words for the two genera in Chinese
 Further, sometimes is sometimes translated to boar after its Japanese name, and 牛 plainly means cow or Ox, and not water buffalo, 水牛
 雞 may mean chicken or cock
 However, Rooster is the most commonly used one among all the synonyms, same for 羊, 鼠, etc
 The Chinese zodiac signs are also used by cultures other than Chinese
 For one example, they usually appear on Korean New Year and Japanese New Year's cards and stamps
 The United States Postal Service and those of several other countries issue a "year of the xxrep 4 _ " postage stamp each year to honor this Chinese heritage
 The Chinese lunar coins, depicting the zodiac animals, inspired the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf coins, as well as varieties from Australia, Korea, and Mongolia
 The Chinese zodiac is an internationally popular theme, available from many of the world's government and private mints
 The Chinese zodiac is also used in some other Asian countries that have been under the cultural influence of China
 However, some of the animals in the zodiac may differ by country
 The Korean zodiac is almost identical to the Chinese zodiac except it includes the Sheep instead of the Goat
 The Vietnamese zodiac is almost identical to the Chinese zodiac except the second animal is the Water Buffalo instead of the Ox, and the fourth animal is the Cat instead of the Rabbit

 Like Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaq Ullah Khan was also a great poet of Urdu language
 unka urdu takhllus, jise hindi main upnaam kehete hai, hasarat tha
 Apart from Urdu, he also wrote articles and poems in Hindi and English
 unka puraa naam ashfaaq ulla khaan varsi hasarat tha
 The role of Bismil and Ashfaq in the entire history of the Indian freedom struggle is indisputably a unique narrative of hindu-muslim unity
 ashfaaq ulla khaan kaa janm uttar pradesh ke shahidgarh shahjahanpur main railway stesan ke paas sthit kadankhel jalaalanagar muhalle main 22 oktober 1900 ko hua tha
 His father's name was Mohammad Shafiq Ulla Khan
 unki maan majahoorunnishaan begum bhalaa kii khubasurat khabaatinon main gini jaati thim
 Ashfaq himself has written in his diary that while on the one hand he could not get even a single graduation in his father-in-law's family, on the other hand, everyone was highly educated
 unamem se kai to dipti colector va es0 je0 em0 ke ohadon par mulajim bhi rah chuke the
 When those people did not support Hindustan in the mutiny of 1857, the people got angry and set their luxurious house on fire

 However, Ashfaq gave his sacrifice and washed away the bad name of the infamous people forever

 Everyone used to call him affectionately

 God has been absconding for a long time and will be living under what circumstances
 bismil unka sabase umdaa classphelo he
 Since then Ashfaq has been desperate to meet Bismil
 vakt gujara
 After the general approval in 1920, Ram Prasad Bismil came to his hometown Shahjahanpur and engaged in domestic business
 ashfaaq ne kai baar bismil se mulaakaat karke unka vishwaas arjeet karnaa chaha parantu kamyaabi nahin mili
 Thus, a meeting was being held in a secluded place on the banks of river Khannaut every night
 Ashfaq reached there
 bismil ke ek sher par jab ashfaaq ne amin kaha to bismil ne unhen paas bulaakar parichay poocha
 Knowing that Ashfaq is a real brother of his classmate Riyasat Ullah and also a poet of Urdu language, Bismil asked him to come to the Arya Samaj temple and meet him separately
 ghar waalon ke lakh manaa karne par bhi ashfaaq arya samaaj ja pahunche or ram prasad bismil se kaaphi der tak guftgu karne ke baad unki party matruvedi ke active member bhi ban gayi
 This is where the new philosophy of his life started
 ve shaayar ke saath-saath kaum ke khidmatgaar bhi ban gayi
 Ashfaq was very far-sighted and advised Ram Prasad Bismil that along with revolutionary activities, keeping his foot in the Congress party would prove to be helpful in our success
 baharhaal ashfaaq va bismil ke saath shahjahanpur ke or bhi kai navayuvak congress main shaamil hue or party ko kaumi takat ata kii
 Ashfaq also joined Ram Prasad Bismil and Premkrishna Khanna in the 1921 Ahmedabad Congress

 When Gandhiji protested against the proposal of Purna Swaraj submitted by Maulana Hasrat Mohani, the Congress volunteers of Shahjahanpur protested against Gandhi and created a lot of uproar
 aakhirkaar gandhi ji ko na chaahate hue bhi vah prastaav sweekaar karnaa hi pada
 Similarly, in the December 1922 Gaya Congress, Gandhi was fiercely pulled by the youth
 isamen bengal, bihar va uttar pradesh ke navayuvak ek ho gayi
 They all had only one question with Gandhi - "whom did you ask and withdrew the non-cooperation Movement?" 1922 kii gaya congress ke baad party main do dal ban gayi ek dhanadhy logon kaa doosraa aam tabake se aaye hue navayuvakon kaa
 The first party formed the Swaraj Party on 1 January 1923, the second party made up its mind to form a revolutionary party
 bengal ke kuch navayuvak sidhe shahjahanpur aakar mainpuri shadyantr ke anbhavi krantikari pandit ram prasad bismil se mili or unase nayi party ke gathan main sahyog karne kaa aagrah kiya
 Bismil was busy in the business of silk sarees in those days, he had no time
 is par ashfaaq ne unhen samajhaayaa or apni ore se puraa sahyog karne kaa vachan diya
 Only after that Bismil handed over the entire business to his partner Banarsi Lal and wholeheartedly engaged in the work of Ashfaq and Bismil Revolutionary Party
 party kii ore se 1 janvari 1925 ko angreji main chaape gayi ghoshnaa patr di rivolutionari ko puure uttar pradesh ke prayek jile tak pahunchaane main ashfaaq kii saraahneey bhoomika ko dekhte hue ech0aar0e0 kii kendriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy yogesh chandra chatarji ne ashfaaq ko bismil kaa sahakaari manonith kiya or pradesh kii jimmevary in donon ke kandhon par daal kar swayan bengal chale gayi
 In Bengal, after the arrest of two prominent persons like Shachindranath Sanyal and Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee, the entire membership of the Hindustan Republican Association fell on the shoulders of Bismil
 isamen shahjahanpur se prem krishna khanna, thakur roshan singh ke atirikt ashfaaq ulla khaan kaa yogadan saraahneey rahaa
 When a plan was made to forcibly snatch money on the lines of the revolutionaries of Ireland, Ashfaq made available to his elder brother Riyasat Ulla Khan's license gun and two boxes of cartridges to Bismil to collect money for the party by putting robberies in the homes of the rich people
 
 kintu jab bismil ne sarkari khajaana luutane kii yojana banaayi to ashfaaq ne akele hi kaaryakarini meeting main iskaa khulkar virodh kiya
 He argued that taking this step right now would not be fraught with danger; The government will destroy us

 The effect of the insistence of including a Muslim in our party, now you will suffer, we will all go

 We accept his decision

 When the iron strong chest was not broken by anyone, Ashfaq grabbed his master Manmathnath Gupta and took the cube and pushed it to full strength
 ashfaaq ke tijori todte hi sabhi ne unki fauladi takat kaa najaara dekha
 Otherwise, if the vault was delayed for a while and the police or army would come from Lucknow, many could have known in the competition; Then that Kakori scandal would have been given another name in history
 26 sitambar 1925 kii raat jab puure desh main ek saath giraftaaryaan huin ashfaaq police kii aankhon main dhul jhonk kar faraar ho gayi
 First he went to Nepal, stayed there for a few days and came to Kanpur and stayed in Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi's Pratap Press for 2 days
 vahaan se banaras hote hue bihar ke ek jile daltonganj main kuch dinon naukari kii parantu police ko isaki bhanak lagane se pehle uttar pradesh ke shahar kanpur waapas aa gayi
 Vidyarthi gave him a few rupees from him and sent him to Bhopal's elder brother Riyasat Ulla Khan

 Sethji's girl turned to him and offered him a marriage proposal
 aakhirkaar ek raat ve vahaan se bhi rafuchakkar ho gayi or bihar ke usee jile daltonganj pahunch kar apni puraani jagah naam badal kar naukari shuru kar di
 One day, when the distinction opened, Ashfaq caught the train and went to Delhi and stayed at the house of an old friend, a native of his district Shahjahanpur
 yahan bhi vahi musiibat ashfaaq ke peeche lag gayi
 The girl of the friend, who was staying here, also started putting her pieces on Ashfaq
 halaat se ajiz aakar ashfaaq ne passport banavaa kar kisi prakaar dilli se baahar videsh jaakar lala hardayal se milane kaa mansooba banaaya hi tha ki kisi bhediye kii khabar paakar dilli khufia police ke upakptain ikrramul haq ne unhen dhar dabocha
 It is said that the friend had assisted the police in arresting Ashfaq
 yah ek aitihaasik sachai he ki kakori kand kaa faisla 6 april 1926 ko suna diya gaya tha
 Ashfaq Ulla Khan and Shachindranath Bakshi were arrested by the police much later, so a supplementary lawsuit was filed in the court of Special Sessions Judge JRW Bennett on 7 December 1926
 mukademe ke magistrate anuddin ne ashfaaq ko salaah di ki ve kisi muslim vakil ko apane cese ke liye niyukt karen kintu ashfaaq ne jid karke kripashankar hajela ko apana vakil chunaa
 On this one day, CID Police Captain Khanbahadur Tasadduk Hussain went to jail and met Ashfaq and advised him to become a government witness to avoid execution
 jab ashfaaq ne unki salaah ko tabajjo nahin di to unhone ekaant main jaakar ashfaaq ko samajhaayaa- On hearing this, Ashfaq's tears went up and he rebuked and said - itnaa sunate hi bechaare captain sahab kii citti-pitti gum ho gayi or ve apana sa munh lekar vahaan se chupchaap khisak liye
 However, on 13 July 1927, the decision of supplementary trial was pronounced - Death and imprisonment under 120 and 121 and death under 396 - Death penalty
 jaj ne apane faisle main saaf-saaf likhaa tha ki in abhiyukton ne apane vyaktigat laabh ke liye yah shadyantr nahin kiya magar phir bhi agar ye log apane kiye par pashchaatap prakat karen to sajaa kam kii ja sakati he
 On the advice of the lawyer, Ashfaq went to Lucknow jail and met Bismil and wanted to know his opinion
 is par bismil ne unhen samajhaayaa ki jis prakaar shatranj ke khel main haari hui baaji jeetne ke liye kabhi kabhaar apane ek do mohare maravane hi passage he, thik usee prakaar ham log bhi maafinama daayar kar apane ko maut kii sajaa se bachaa saken to behatar rahegaa
 After the completion of life imprisonment in seven years, we will kill this terrible government by doing a terrible scandal
 parsparik sahmati se udhar ram prasad bismil ne or idhar ashfaaq ulla khaan ne apana-apana maafinama daayar kar diya
 Ashfaq sent the first apology in writing on 11 August 1927 and the second apology on 29 August 1927
 iske atirikt vakil kii salaah par ek or marsi-apil ashfaaq kii maan musammaat majahoorunnishaan begum kii taraf se vysarai tathaa governor general ko bheji gayi parantu us par koi vichaar hi nahin hua
 After Ashfaq and his mother, the members of the Legislative Assembly jointly signed and sent a memorandum to the Governor of the United Provinces, William Morris, Nainital

 i am sure that if they are left alive after not being hanged, then what will be spread in the whole of India? " All these appeals and pleas had such an effect that the date of execution was extended twice
 pahle yah taarikh 16 sitambar 1927 thi, baad main 11 oktober 1927 hui
 Since the mercy-appeal had gone to the Privy Council of London, the date of the execution was again postponed
 aakhirkaar 19 disambar 1927 kii taarikh mukarrar hui or isaki soochna chaaro jelon ko bhej di gayi
 As soon as this information reached the Faizabad jail, Ashfaq wrote a letter to his brother Riyasat Ulla Khan on 29 November 1927, his brother-in-law Mohatrama Mazhurunnishan Begum on 15 December 1927 and sister Nalini Didi on his face on 16 December 1927 and got engaged in the worship of God

 His aim was that the people of the Muslim community should pay special attention to this
 ek police adhikari pan0 vidhyarnav sharma kii pustak yug ke devtaa : bismil or ashfaaq main prishth sankhya 172 se 178 tak yah puraa sandesh diya hua he usee main se kuch khaas ansh vikipedia ke darshakon hetu yahan par diye ja rahe hai
 After this, while talking about the benefits of hindu-muslim unity, Etihad like the Congress of Ahmedabad, taking away the ghost of white English, the country is giving an unmatched advice to renounce foreign fascination and hatred for the things of the country; Had requested "to every man upon this earth, death cometh soon or late
but how can man die better, than facing fearful odds
for the ashes of his fathers, and temples of his gods
" Late poet Agnivesh Shukla of Shahjahanpur wrote this soulful poem in which he spent the last night of his life before hanging in the prison cell of Faizabad jail and gave the beautiful words of Hindi words to the storm of the hearts of the rising of Ashfaq
 is
 vikipedia ke pathakon kii seva main yahan us kavita ke chuninda ansh diye ja rahe hai: Bismil is a Hindu, he says, i will come again and again; Take a new born mother India! i will liberate you
 
 Yes, i should also say, but i am bound by religion; i am a Muslim, i am not able to say about rebirth
 haan, khuda agar mil gaya kahin, apni jholii failaa doongaa; ou' jananath ke badale usase, yak nayaa janm hi maangoonga

 Ashfaq's body was being brought from Faizabad District Prison to Shahjahanpur
 lakhanu stesan par gadee badalte samay kanpur se beemaari ke baavjood chalakar aaye ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ne unki laash ko apane shraddha-suman arpit kiye
 The Parsishah photographer photographed the body of Ashfaq and Ashfaq's family went back to Kanpur instructing the people to get their pucca mausoleum built in Shahjahanpur, if money is needed, i will send a money order from Kanpur
 ashfaaq kii laash ko unke pushtaini makaan ke saamne vaale bageeche main dafna diya gaya
 On his tomb, these lines were written as Ashfaq Ullah Khan on the marble stone: tera jeena tere marane kii badaulat hoga
 Ashfaq already knew that after his martyrdom, only the Liberal Party, or Congress, would come to power in India and there would be no discussion of the sacrifices of common people like him; Only the memorials of the rulers will be preserved
 tabhi to unhone ye qataa kahkar vartmaan halaat kii bhavishya-vaani bahut pehle san 1927 main hi kar di thi: It is a matter of great regret, the martyr is in love with Ashfaq and the shadow of sunshine !! ganimat he ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ne 200 rupee kaa maniorder bhejkar ashfaaq kii majaar par chat dalava kar use dhoop ke saaye se bachaa liya
 Ashfaq was a very good poet like Ram Prasad 'bismil'
 in donon kii shaayari kii agar tulana kii jaye to ratti bhar kaa bhi fark aapako najar nahin aayegaa
 In the first meeting itself, Bismil became interested in Ashfaq when in a meeting, he gave a reply to a lion of Bismil with his maestro liver Muradabadi's Ghazal fly
 jab bismil ne kaha- So Ashfaq responded by saying "amen" - ek roj kaa vakya he ashfaaq arya samaaj mandir shahjahanpur main bismil ke paas kisi kaam se gayi
 Incidentally, at that time Ashfaq Jigar was humming this ghazal of Muradabadi
 bismil yah sher sunakar muskaraa diye to ashfaaq ne puch hi liya-"kyon ram bhai! maine misra kuch galat kah diya kya?" is par bismil ne jabaab diya- "nahin mere krishna kanhaiya! yah baat nahin
 i respect Jigar Sahib very much, but he shot a big arrow on the old ground of Mirza Ghalib, saying that he was a beaten lion
 koi nayi rangath dete to main bhi irshaad kahata
 "ashfaq did not like this thing of Bismil; he said in a challenging tone -" Ram bhai! Now you fall into it, i will admit that your thinking is of a higher status than the liver and Mirza Ghalib
 " usee vakt pandit ram prasad 'bismil' ne ye sher kaha- On hearing this, Ashfaq jumped up and hugged Bismil and said, "ram brother! i agree; you are masters of maestro too
" " After this, there was competition in Ashfaq and Bismil to say a great lion
 parantu agar dhyaan se dekha jaye to donon main ek tarah kii telepathy kaam karti thi tabhi to unke jajbaton main ekarupata dikhaayi detii he
 For example, Chand Misre is the spot: this lion of Bismil- ashfaaq kii is kata ke kitna kareeb jaan padataa he- These lines of Bismil were written after seeing the financial condition of the country as crisp- ashfaaq ke is sher se kitni adhik milti hai- Similarly, Bismil's agony on the barwadi of the country
 se miltaa julata ashfaaq kaa yah sher kisi bhi tarah apni kiafiyat main kamatar nahin- One of Bismil's great famous ghazal expectations - these lines of Sukhan - ashfaaq ko bahut pasand thim
 He had said only one lion in the same way, which is found in his unpublished diary as follows: - jinhen ashfaaq or bismil kii shaayari kaa vishesh yaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karnaa ho ve kisi bhi pustkaalay main jaakar swadhinata sangram ke krantikari sahitya kaa itihaas granthavali kaa doosraa bhaag dekh sakate hai

 It is also used in making chloroform and chlorine gas
 ise viranjanchurna bhi kehete hai
 It is chloride of lime and looks white like lime but has an odor of chlorine
 iskaa nirmaan sarvapratham glassgo ke charles tenant ne san 1799 main kiya tha
 Bleaching powder is not permanent
 samay bitne ke saath saath isamen chlorine kii maatra kam hoti jaati he, jisase iske viranjan gun kaa hraas hota jaataa he
 In commercial bleaching powder, sufficient amount of inactive substances are found in the bleaching point
 ucch taap par yah vighatit ho jaataa he
 It also decomposes slowly with air humidity and carbon dioxide
 viranjanchurna kaa nirmaan chooney or chlorine se hota he
 It is formed by the action of chlorine on extinguished lime
 chooney ke do se teen inch gahare str par chlorine gas pravaahit kii jaati he
 This level of lime is made in a chamber of 10 to 20 feet wide, 100 feet long and 6 to 7 feet high and there is a system of reversing the level from time to time as required
 chlorine kaa avasorana pehle tivrata se hota he par peeche mand pad jaataa he
 The place of the chamber now behaves in the tubes, in which lime falls from the top and enters chlorine from the bottom and immediate powder is obtained by the absorption of chlorine by lime between the two tubes
 calcium prakram dwaara nirmaan Manufacturing by sodium process viranjanchurna kaa sutara diya gaya he
 In this, one bond of calcium is related to chlorine and the other one is related to hypochlorous element
 churna main kuch asamyukt chuunaa bhi mila rahata he
 Hence, it seems to have a lot to do with the idea of mobilization
 churna kaa samast chlorine viranjan ke liye uplabdh nahin hota
 At least 40% of chlorine is available, but the amount of chlorine available in normal powder is always less than it and decreases with the passage of time
 viranjan ke liye or kriminashak rup main is churna kaa prayog vyapaktaa se hota he, par churna ke sthaan main ab anya kai padaarth, jaise drav chlorine, calcium hypochlorite, sodium chlorite,, jinamein uplabdh chlorine kii maatra viranjanchurna se kahin adhik he, adhikadhik upyog main aa rahe hai
 Sursagar is a beautiful compilation of kirtan-padas composed by Mahakavi Surdas in Braj Bhasha which is semantically appropriate and respectable
 isamen pratham nau adhyay sankshipt he, par dasham skandh kaa bahut vistaar ho gaya he
 There is a predominance of devotion in it
 iske do prasang "krishna kii bal-lila' or "bhramar-geetsar' atyadhik mahatvapurn hai
 There are said to be about one lakh posts in Sursagar
 kintu vartmaan sanskarnon main lagbhag paanch hajaar pad hi milte hai
 More than a hundred copies of it have been received at various places, which date from the period 1658 to the nineteenth century, the oldest of them being found safe in the Saraswati store at Nathdwara
 darshanik vichaaron kii drushti se "bhagwat' or "sursagar' main paryaapt antar he
 Dr
 Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, while appreciating Sursagar has written - puraa hastlikhit rup main "sursagar" ke do rup milte hai - "sangrahatmak" or sanskrit bhagwat anusaar "dwadash skandhaatmak"
 Two forms of collective "sursagar" are also seen
 pehla, aapke-gaughat par shrivalbhacharya ke shishy hone par pratham pratham rache gaye bhagavallilatmak pad- "braj bhayu maihair ken put, jab yai baat suni" se prarambh hota he, doosraa-"mathura-janm-lila" se
 


 It is said that there is a separate history of origins development of Ojhal "sursagar" from the Hindi literary history texts, which have not come to light till now and the contemporary devotees of Shri Sur are the creators of the history- "shri Gokulnathji, Srihariraji ji and Shri Nabhadas ji Prabhriti Which is specifically mentioned in at: in purva par ke anek mahatvapurn granthon se janaa jaataa he ki shri sur ne sahasravadhi pad kiye, lakshavadhi pad rache, koi granth nahin rachaa
 Later called anant-sur-padavali Sagar
 vastut: shrisur, jaisaa in upar liye sandarbh granthon se janaa jaataa he, bhagavallila ke bhav bhare unmukt gayak the, so nity nai-nai pad rachana kar, apane prabhu "govardhannath ji" ke sammukh gaaya karte the
 They were supposed to compose, so they used to bless themselves by filling the color of fine rasas in the ragas sung from morning to evening
 astu, na unamem apni unmukt kritiyon ko sangrah karne kaa bhav tha or na kai kram dene kii umang
 His task was to sing his Lord's maternal grandfather, Gunuli Garuli Gunavali, to be immersed in his amritopam rasa and to be meticulously different in the pastimes from Baal to Poond state in the Nandalaya of "etechansha Kalpuns: Krishnastu Bhagwan Himself", here all his free compositions Where was the time and place to collect and sort
 kaha jaataa he, shri surdaas "ekadam andhe the," tab apni jab tab kii samast rachanaaon ko kaise ekatra karte? phir bhi surdaas dwaara nity rache or gaaye jane vaale padon kaa lekhan or sankalan avashya hota rahaa hoga
 Otherwise, they would have occupied the original composed and sung verse
 sambhavat: sur ke samakaleen shishy yaa mitra-yadi sur sachmooch andhe the to-un padon ko likhte or sankalit karte rahe honge
 So far, no history of his collection or davadas being combative is fully known
 "geet-sangeet-sagar" shri vitthalanath ji goswami, ke samay shrimadvallabhacharya sevit kai nidhiyaan, aapke vanshajon dwaara, braj se baahar chali gai thim
 According to the sect, "no service without kirtans and no kirtan without service", so wherever these funds went, there were also the works of poets of Ashthachap in the form of "kantha" or "granth" and in the form of their compiled- It is also called "nitya Kirtan" and "salotsav"
 sur ke sagar kaa "sangrahatmak" rup shrisur ke sammukh hi sankalit ho chukaa tha
 Its no a written copy of 1630 AD is found in Braj
 baad ke anek likhit sangraroop bhi uske milte hai
 Its printed form is far older
 pehle yah mathura se, baad main agra, jaipur, dilli or kalakatta se san
 1898 i
 main litho preson se chhapakar prakashit ho chukaa tha
 The "ragakalpadrum" compiled by Krishnananda Vyasadeva is also a distorted form of the contemporary Sursagar of the time, divided into shades of music
 brajabhasha ke reetikalin prasiddh kavi "dwijadev"-arthath maharaj maansingh, ayodhya naresh ne ise san
 1920 vi
 main sampadit kar lakhanu ke navalkishor press se prakashit kiya tha
 All these collective forms Sursagar, beginning with the "nandamahotsav" celebrated in Gokul Nandalaya, the birth-singing form of Lord Krishna, all his Brajila Mathura arrival, uddhav-gopi-samvad, Sri Rama, Narasimha and Vamana Jainties and the discipleship of Shri Vallabhacharya Ji
 The post of "decent Shelter" created before
 sur padon ke is prakaar sankalan kii pravriti unke sagar ke sangrahatmak rup par hi samaapt nahin, vah vividh roopon main aage badi, jisase unki pad kriti ke naanaa sankalit rup hastlikhit tathaa mudrit dekhne main aate hai, jo is prakaar hai-deenta aashray ke pad, drushtikul pad, jise aaj "sahityalahari" kaha jaataa he
 The Ramayana, the verses of Balleela, Vinay Patrika, Vairagyasatak, Surachtisi, Surbahotari, Sura Bhramargit, Surasathi, Surdas Nayan, Murali Madhuri etc
 - etc
, but all these collections are the sweet fruits of your collective "sagar Kalpataru"
 shri sur ke sagar kaa rup shri vyas pranit or shuk-mukh-nisruth "dwadash skandhaatmak" bhi bana
 When he became, nothing can be said
 hindi ke saahityetihaas granth is vishay main chup hai
 The oldest copy of this Dwarkadhkash "sur Sagar" No
 Meets 1757 v
 iske baad kii kai hastlikhit pratiyaan milti hai
 On their basis, it can be said that this "dwadash punitive form according to Srimad Bhagwat" of Surya Samudit Sagar was not made before the eighteenth century
 uskaa purvakthith "sangrahatmak" rup is samay tak kaaphi prasar paa chukaa tha
 Also, there was no significant difference between the beauty, the simplicity of this form, and the purity and beauty of the language
 vah sur ke samay jaisi vividh raagamayi thi waisi hi sundar bani rahi, kintu iske is dwadash skandhaatmak roopon main vah baat samuchit rup se nahin rah saki
 As she moved forward in handwritten forms, she moved away from the mangul language of Sur
 phir bhi jis kisi vyakti ne apana astitv khokar or "hari, hari, hari hari sumran karau" jaise asundar bhashahin kathatmak padon kii rachana kar tathaa shri sur ke shrimadvallabhacharya kii charansharan main aane se pehle rache gaye "deenta aashray" ke pad visheshon ko bhagwat anusaar pratham skandh tak hi nahin, dasham skandh uttarardh, ekadash or dwadash skandhon ko sanjoya, vah aadarneey he
