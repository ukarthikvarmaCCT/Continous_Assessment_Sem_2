 Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that form the basis of sustainable mechanics
 ye niyam kisi vastu par lagane vaale bal or usase utpann us vastu kii gati ke bich sambandh bataate hai
 They have been expressed in many ways in three centuries
 newton ke gati ke teenon niyam, parmparik rup se, sankshep main nimnlikhit hai- Newton first compiled them in his book Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica
 newton ne anek sthanon par bhautik vastuon kii gati se sambandhit samasyaon kii vyakhya main inkaa prayog kiya tha
 In the third part of his book, Newton demonstrated that these three laws of motion and their universal law of gravitation are capable of interpreting Kepler's laws related to the motion of celestial bodies
 newton ke gati niyam sirf unhi vastuon par lagaaya jaataa he jinhen ham ek kan ke rup main maan sake
 Meaning that when measuring the speed of those objects, their size is ignored
 un vastuon ke pind ko ek bindu main kendrit man kar in niyamo ko lagaaya jaataa he
 This is done when the distances in the analysis are much larger than the objects
 isliye grahon ko ek kan maan kar unke kakshiya gati ko mapa ja saktaa he
 In its original form, the rules of these motions cannot be applied to fixed and deformable bodies
 1750 main leonard ular ne newton ke gati niyamo kaa vistaar kiya or ular ke gati niyamon kaa nirmaan kiya jinhen drudh or virupanshil pindo par bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If an object is considered to be a combination of discrete particles, in which Newton's laws of motion can be applied separately, Euler's law of motion can be derived from Newton's law of motion
 newton ke gati niyam bhi kuch nirdesh tantron main hi lagu hote he jinhen jadtviya nirdesh tantra kaha jaataa he
 Many authors believe that the first rule defines the inertial instruction system and the second law is valid only with those instruction systems, for this reason the first rule cannot be called a special form of the second law
 par kuch pehle niyam ko duusare kaa parinaam maanate he
 The explicit concept of directive systems developed long after Newton died
 newtoni yantriki kii jagah ab oinstin ke vishesh aapekshikta ke siddhant ne le lee he par phir bhi iskaa istemaal prakaash kii gati se kam gati vaale pindon ke liye abhi bhi kiya jaataa he
 In Newton's original words hindi anuwaad "every object remains in its stagnation or uniform velocity until it is induced to change its state by some external factor
 " In other words, the object which is in resting state will remain in the resting state and the object which is in motion will remain in motion unless any external force is applied on it
 newton kaa pratham niyam padaarth ke ek prakritik gun jadtv ko paribhaashit karat he jo gati main badlaav kaa virodh karata he
 Therefore, the first law is also called the law of inertia
 yah niyam apratksh rup se jadtviya nirdesh tantra tathaa bal ko bhi paribhaashit karata he
 Because of this, this rule was put first by Newton
 is niyam kaa saral pramanikaran mushkil he kyonki gharshan or gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ko zyaadaatar pind mahasoos karte hai
 Actually, Galileo described this observation before Newton
 newton ne anya shabdon main ise vyakt kiya
 In Newton's original words: hindi main anuwaad "A change in the momentum of an object is proportional to the impact on the object and occurs in the same direction
" "newton ke is niyam se adholikhit bindu vyupatrit kiye ja sakate he : Where f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} force, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} momentum and t { \ displaystyle t} are time
 is sameekaran ke anusaar, jab kisi pind par koi bahya bal nahin he, to pind kaa samveg sthir rahata he
 When the mass of the body is constant, the equation can be written in a simpler form: jahaan m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman he or a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} twaran he
 That is, the acceleration of a body is proportional to the force applied
 aaveg dwitiya niyam se sambandhit he
 Impulse means a change in momentum
 arthath: Where i is the impulse
 aaveg takkaron ke vishleshan main bahut ahm he
 Let the mass of a body be m
 is par ek niyam bal f ko ∆tsamayanwarala ke liye lagane par veg main ∆v parivartit ho jaataa he
 Then Newton- atah kisi pind ko diya gaya aaveg, pind main utpann samveg- parivartan ke samaan hota he
 Therefore, the unit of impulse is the same as that of the impulse
 tritiy niyam kaa arth he ki kisi bal ke sangat ek or bal he jo uske samaan or vipareet he
 Newton used this rule to describe the law of momentum conservation, but actually momentum conservation is a more fundamental principle
 kai udahaaran hai jinamein samveg sangrakshit hota he lekin tritiy niyam maanya nahin he

 In physics, energy is a property of objects, which can be transferred to other objects or transformed into different forms
 kisi bhi kaaryakarta ke kaary karne kii kshamta ko urja kehete hai
 There is energy in the water falling from a height because it can rotate a wheel to generate electricity
 urja kii saral paribhaasha dena kathin he
 Energy is not an object
 isko ham dekh nahin sakate, yah koi jagah nahin gherti, na isaki koi chaaya hi padati he
 In short, like other things, it is not a substance, although it is often closely related to matter
 phir bhi iskaa astitv utana hi vaastavik he jitna kisi anya vastu kaa or is kaaran ki kisi pind samudaay main, jiske upar kisi bahari bal kaa prabhaav nahin rahata, isaki maatra main kami beshi nahin hoti
 The ability to work normally is called energy
 jab dhanush se shikaar karanevaala koi shikari dori ko khinchataa he to dhanush main urja aa jaati he jiskaa upyog baan ko shikaar tak chalaane main kiya jaataa he
 The flowing water has energy that can be used for running watermills or for any other work
 isi tarah barood main urja hoti he, jiskaa upyog pathar kii shilaayein todane athwa top se gola daagne main ho saktaa he
 The electric current carries energy from which the electric motor can be driven
 surya ke prakaash main urja hoti he jiskaa upyog prakashaselon dwaara bijli kii dhara utpann karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, nuclear energy is there in the molecule, which is used in destroying the enemy or other work
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki urja kai roopon main pai jaati he
 The energy that is in the stem spring is called potential energy; The energy of flowing water is kinetic energy; The energy of gunpowder is chemical energy; The energy of electric current is electrical energy; The energy of sunlight is called light energy
 surya main jo urja he vah uske unche taap ke kaaran he
 This is called heat energy
 vibhinn upayon dwaara urja ko ek rup se duusare rup main parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 The amount of energy in these changes is always the same
 usamen kami beshi nahin hoti
 This is called energy-indestructibility principle
 upar kaha gaya he ki kaary kar sakane kii kshamta ko urja kehete hai
 But it is not always possible to convert all the energy into work
 isliye yah kahana adhik upyukt hoga ki urja vah vastu he jo utani hi ghatati he jitna kaary hota he
 For this reason, they are the units of measuring energy
 jo kaary ko naapane ke
 If we lift a kilogram of a meter high, then a certain amount of work has to be done against the gravity of the Earth
 yadi ham isi bhaar ko do meter unchaa uthaayen athwa do kilogram bhaar ko ek meter unchaa uthaayen to donon dashaon main pehle kii apeksha duuna kaary karnaa padegaa
 This shows that the magnitude of the work depends on the magnitude of the force against which the work is done and the magnitude of the distance, the distance by which the force is worked against, and is equal to the product of both these dimensions
 
 kaary kii kisi bhi maatra ko ham kaary kaa ekak maan sakate hai
 For example, the work that one kilogram has to do to lift a meter high against the attraction of the earth can be considered a unit
 parantu prithvi kaa aakarshan sab jagah ek samaan nahin hota
 Its value in Chennai is not in Delhi
 isliye yah ekak asuvidhapurna he
 Yet engineers in many countries use similar units
 jise foot-pound kehete hai
 This is the amount of work that is done on the beach in London's latitude using one pound of another unit dependent on the centimeter-gram-second
 isamen bal ke ekak ko "dine" kehete hai
 Dine is a unit of force that can produce a velocity of one centimeter per second in one gram of a second
 is bal ke kriyabindu ko iske viruddh ek sein
 me
 hataane main jitna kaary karnaa padataa he use varg kehete hai
 But in practical terms this unit of work is very small
 atev dainik vyavhaar main ek doosraa ekak upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 The unit of length is meters instead of centimeters and the unit of mass is kilograms instead of grams
 isamen bal kaa ekak "newton" he
 Newton is a unit of force that can produce a velocity of one meter per second in a second in a kilogram of body
 is tarah newton 1 xxrep 5 0 dine ke baraabar hota he
 The work required to remove the action point of this force up to one meter against it is called Joule
 ek jul 107 argo ke baraabar hota he
 Energy is also measured in these units
 parantu kabhi kabhi vishesh sthalon par kuch anya ekakon kaa upyog hota he
 They have one electron volt
 vah urja kaa vah ekak he jise electron kaa volt ke vibhavantar se guzarane par praapt karata he
 It is a very small unit and is only equal to 1
60 x 10 -19 joules
 iske atirikt gharon main upyog main aanevaali vaidyut urja ko naapane ke liye ek duusare ekak kaa upyog hota he, jise kilowat-ghanta kehete hai or jo 3
6x 10 6 julon ke baraabar hota he l urja ke unit ko jhon perscot jul ke urja ke kshetra me ek kranti laane kii yaad me 'jul' rakhaa
 Instead of those objects, whose existence we can only estimate on the basis of logic, we have a much easier knowledge of those objects which we can see in a broad way
 manushya ke mastishk main urja ke us rup kii bhaavana sabase pratham udai hui jiskaa sambandh bade bade pindon se he or jise yantron kii sahaayta se kaaryrup main parinaat hote ham spashtat: dekh sakate hai
 There are two forms of this mechanical energy: one is potential energy and the other is kinetic energy
 iske vipareet us urja kaa gyaan jiskaa sambandh anuon tathaa parmaanuon kii gati se he, manushya ko baad main hua
 For this reason, it is no less surprising that even before Newton, Francis Bacon believed that heat is due to the motion of particles of matter
 ek kilogram bhaar ke ek pind ko prithvi ke aakarshan ke viruddh ek meter unchaa uthaane main jo kaary karnaa padataa he use ham kilogram-meter kah sakate hai or yah lagbhag 981 julon ke baraabar hota he
 If we take a string and put it on top of a pulley and tie about one kilogram of bodies from both its ends and leave them in such a position that both of them are not at the same height and allow the upper body to come down very slowly, then we We will see that one kilogram will raise the object one meter high
 ghirani main gharshan jitna hi kam hoga doosraa pind bhaar main utana hi pehle pind ke bhaar ke baraabar rakhaa ja sakegaa
 This means that if we raise a body higher than the earth
 ek kilogram bhaar ke pind ko yadi 5 meter unchaa uthaaya jaae to usamen 5 kilogram-meter kaary karne kii kshamta aa jaati he, evam uski urja pehle kii apeksha usee pariman main bad jaati he
 This energy is due to the relative position of the Earth and the body and is actually the energy of the system made by the Earth and the body
 isiilie ise sthitij urja kehete hai
 Whenever there is a difference in the mutual distance of a community of objects or the natural position of different parts of the same body, there is a difference in potential energy
 kamaani ko dabaane se athwa dhanush ko jhukaane se unamem sthitij urja aa jaati he
 If the water is collected at a higher height by damming the rivers, then this water brings potential energy
 newton ne bal kii yah paribhaasha di ki bal samveg ke parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 If a body of m kg is initially stationary and has a constant force F, working for t seconds, the velocity it produces is v m per second, then the value of force is mvt { \ displaystyle { \ frac {mv} {t} }} Will be Newton
 isi samay main pind jo duuri tai kare vah yadi d meter ho to bal dwaara kiya gaya kaary F
d jul ke baraabar hoga
 That is, if the velocity of the mass in m mass is v then its energy will be 1 2 mv 2 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {1} {2}} mv ^ {2}}
 yah urja us pind main uski gati ke kaaran hoti he or gatij urja kehalaati he
 When we release the arrow by tilting the bow, the potential energy of the bow changes to the kinetic energy of the arrow
 sthitij urja evam gatij urja ke parsparik parivartan kaa sabase sundar udhaaharan saral lolak he
 When we pull the pendulum to one side, the ball rises slightly above its normal position and the potential energy comes into it
 jab ham golak ko chhodte hai to golak idhar udhar jhulane lagata he
 When the ball is in the normal position of hanging, it only has kinetic energy
 samveg ke kaaran golak duusari ore chalaa jaataa he or gatij urja pun: sthitij urja main parivartit ho jaati he
 Normally, working against the friction of air reduces the energy of the ball and its motion stops in some time
 yadi gharshan kaa bal na ho to lolak anant kaal tak chalata rahegaa
 Even after the theory of energy-indestructibility in motion science was proven, it was believed that energy can be lost in many situations due to lack of knowledge of its other forms; For example, when different parts of a body have the expected speed, friction reduces the potential and kinetic energy
 vastut: aisi sthitiyon main urja nasht nahin hoti varan ushma urja main parivartan ho jaati he
 But until the 18th century, heat was not considered an independent form of energy
 us samay tak yah dharna thi ki ushma ek dravya he
 It was proved indisputably by experiments in the 19th century that heat is also another form of energy
 yon to pragaitihaasik kaal main bhi manushya lakadiyon ko ragadkar agni utpann karata tha, parantu urja evam ushma ke ghanishtha sambandh kii ore sabase pehle benjamin tamson kaa dhyaan gaya
 It was a resident of the United States of Massachusetts
 parantu us samay yah bavaria ke raja kaa yudhmantri tha
 While piercing the molded brass cannon tubes, he noticed that the tube becomes very hot and the fillets from it become even more heated
 ek prayog main top kii naal ke chaaron ore kaath kii naand main pani bharkar usne dekha ki kharadane se jo ushma utpann hoti he usase dhai ghante main sara pani ubalane ke taap tak pahunch gaya
 In this experiment, his real goal was to prove that heat is not a liquid that is in the bodies and due to pressure comes out like water from the cloth by squeezing; Because if this were the case, there would be only a limited amount of fluid in a body, but it is known by the use of perforator that the more work done, the more heat will be generated
 rumuard ne yah prayog san 1798 i
 main kiya
 20 years before this, Lavaggee and lagrange saw that animals produce as much heat from food as can be obtained from food by chemical reactions
 san 1819 main francisi vaigyanik dulon ne dekha ki kisi gas ke sampeden se usamen ushma usee anupaat main utpann hoti he jitna sampeden main kaary kiya jaataa he
 In 1842 AD, the same sentiment was used by Julius Robert Maier, who was then only 28 years old and a doctor in the city of Highbronn, Germany, to calculate how much work is necessary to produce a heat of heat
 
 ham jaanate hai ki prayek gas kii do vishisht ushmayen hoti he : ek niyat aaytan par tathaa duusari niyat daab par
 In the first stage, the gas does not work
 duusari avasthaa main gas ko bahya dabaav ke viruddh kaary karnaa padataa he or donon vishisht ushmaaon main jo antar hota he vah isi kaary ke samatuly hota he
 In this way, the value of mechanical equivalent of heat that Maier received was almost the same as that of Count Rumford
 isi samay england main james presskaat jul bhi ushma kaa yantric tulyank nikaalane main laga hua tha
 Its use continued from 1842 AD to 1852 AD
 apane prayog main isane ek taanbe ke ushmamapi main pani liya or use ek mathni se matha
 The churn was run on two loads hanging from two pulleys
 jis door se ye bhaar latake hue the vah is mathni ke sire main lapeti hui thi or jab ye bhaar neeche kii ore girte the to mathni gumti thi
 When these loads fell, their potential energy was reduced
 is kami kaa kuch bhaag bhaaron kii gatij urja main parinat hota tha or kuch bhaag mathni ko ghumaane main vyay hota tha
 In this way it could be known how much work was being done to rotate the churn
 ushmamapi ke pani ke taap main jitani vruddhi hui usase yah gyaat ho saktaa tha ki kitni ushma utpann hui; or tab ushma kaa yantric tulyank gyaat kiya ja saktaa tha
 Joule did these experiments with both water and mercury
 san 1847 i
 main harmaan phan helmholts ne ek pustak likhi jisamen ushma, chumbak, bijli, bhautik rasayan aadi vibhinn kshetron ke udaahranon dwaara ushma-avinashita-siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya tha
 Joule proved the similarity of electrical energy and heat energy by experiment
 dekhen - vidyut urja In 1905, Einstein proposed his relative theory according to which the mass of particles depends on their kinetic energy
 iskaa yah arth he ki urja kaa maan dravyaman vruddhi ko prakaash ke veg ke varg se guna karne par praapt hota he
 This theory is confirmed by many experiments in nuclear science
 surya main bhi urja isi tarah banati he
 There is a chain reaction in the Sun, which results from the combination of four nuclei of hydrogen to form the nucleus of helium
 hydrogen ke chaaron nabhikon ke dravyaman kaa yogafal helium ke nabhik se kuch adhik hota he
 This difference is converted into energy
 parmaanu bam evam hydrogen bam main bhi isi dravyaman-urja-samatulyata kaa upyog hota he
 Studying what is the exact formula for the distribution of the radiation of the Krishna body according to the different alphabets of the spectrum, Plank came to the conclusion that the exchange of radiation does not happen in irregular amounts by small particles of direct energy
 in kanon ko rahata he
 Multiplying the frequency number by which the value of the energyquantum is obtained is called the Planck constant
 niles bor ne san 1913 i
 main yah dikhalaayaa ki yah kwantum siddhant atyant vyapak he or parmaanuon main electron jin kakshaon main ghoomte hai
 Those orbits are also fixed according to quantum theory
 jab electron adhik urjawali kaksha se kam urjawali kaksha main jaataa he to in do urjaaon kaa antar prakaash ke rup main baahar aata he
 Heisenberg, Schrödinger and Dirac have expanded this quantum theory even further
 aadhunik bhautik vigyaan main prayek kaary ke liye urja ko aavashyak bataaya gaya he
 According to the energy conservation principle, energy can neither be generated nor destroyed, only its form can be changed
 ham apane dainik jivan main prayog karne hetu urja ke istemaal kai roopon main karte hai, yatha - yantric urja, vidyut urja, ooshmiya urja, prakaash urja, rasaynic urja ityadi
 The electrical energy in the motor is converted into mechanical energy and the chemical energy in the battery into electrical energy
 maanav sharir khaadya padaarthon kii rasinic urja ko pachaa kar usase yantric kaary karata he
 Similarly, an electric bulb converts electrical energy into light and thermal energy
 car yaa bas kaa eenjan petrol kii rasinic urja ko pehle ooshmiya urja main badalata he tathaa use phir yantric urja main
 The energy used for all these functions comes from these sources - urja kii avadharana unnisvin shatabdi main aayi
 It is a very important and fundamental concept invented by humans
 yah vibhinn prakaar kii ghatnaon main hone vaali antarkriyaaon ko sankhyatmak rup main vyakt karne main bahut upyogi he
 In a way, it can be understood as a universal currency for interactions between different physical phenomena
 urja kii avadharana se hi parivartan evam transmishan se sambandhit he jo ki audyogic kranti ke aadhaar hai
 As long as only human or animal energy was used, energy was limited; It was a difficult task to automate and control
 kintu vaashp aadi se chalane vaali mashiinon ke avishkaar se yah sthiti badal gayi jisase audyogic kranti kaa sutarapaat hua
 In the modern period, the energy consumed by a country is a major measure of its development

 The League sent a commission representing the various powers of the region, and in November 1921, the League decided that the borders of Albania, with three small changes that favored Yugoslavia, would remain the same as they were
 Was in 1913
 yadhyapi virodh ke tahat, yugoslavian fujen kuch saptaah baad hi peeche hat gayi
 The borders of Albania once again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General Enrico Telini and four of his assistants were killed in an ambush on 24 August 1923, when they were going to demarcate the newly demarcated border between Greece and Albania

 Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government should give Italy five crore lira as compensation
 The Greeks said that they would not pay the amount of compensation until it was proved that the crime was committed by the Greeks
 musolini ne unani dweep corfu ko jeetne ke liye ek yudhpot bheja or italvi sena ne 31 agast 1923 ko corfu par kabja kar liya

 french or polish sarkarein memel ko ek antarrashtriya shahar ke rup main parivartit karnaa chaahati thi jabaki lithuania us kshetra par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha
 By 1923, no decision was made regarding control of the region, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and take over the port

 According to the British, who were given the League of Nations A-mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; On the other hand, the new Turkish Republic claimed the province to be its own historical central part
 belgium, hungary or sweden ke sadasyon ke saath ek raashtra sangh jaanch ayog ko 1924 main is kshetra ke adhyayan ke liye bheja gaya tha jisane paaya ki mosul ke log turki kaa hissaa nahin bananaa chaahate the or yadi unase chunane ko kaha jaataa to ve iraq ko chunate

 Agreed to support the League's plan for the region, remove the Polish troops, and cooperate with the referendum
 The League, however, now faced opposition from Lithuania and the Soviet Union, which had opposed any international force in Lithuania
 The League canceled the referendum and plans made for international force in March 1921 and came back to resolve the issue through negotiations between the two parties

 The Sangh's many successes were accomplished by its various agencies and commissions

 Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria

 Following allegations of forced labor in the us-owned Firestone Rubber Plantation and US allegations of slave trade, the Liberian government asked the United Nations to launch an investigation
 The commission constituted for the investigation was jointly appointed by the Union, the United States and Liberia
 1930 main, sangh kii ek report main pushti kii gai ki das pratha tathaa jabaran mazdooree prachlit thi
 The report found many government officials involved in the sale of bonded laborers and recommended that they be replaced by European or American ones
 The Liberian government outlawed slavery and forced labor and sought US assistance, a move that provoked anger inside Liberia resulting in President Charles DB King and his vice-president resigning
 The League then threatened that a trusteeship would be established on Liberia until the reforms were implemented
 President Edwin Barkley's focus shifted to implementing these reforms

 Subject to the terms of an agreed lease, the Japanese government was empowered to deploy its forces to the surrounding areas of the Southern Manchurian Railway, a major trade route between the two countries through the Chinese territory of Manchuria
 Was

 However, Japanese soldiers claimed that the railway had been demolished by Chinese troops and in apparent retaliation occupied the entire territory of Manchuria

 Internationally, this new country was recognized only by the governments of Italy and Germany, while the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China
 san 1932 main, japan kii vaayu or jal sena ne china ke shanghai shahar par bamavarsha kii, jisane 28 janvari kii ghatana ko chingaari pradaan kiya
 The League of Nations agreed to request the Chinese government, but the long sea voyage caused the members of the union to delay investigating the case

 Despite Japan's high reach in the Union, the report presented by Litton proved Japan aggressive and demanded that Manchuria be returned to China
 Before the report was voted on by the Legislative Assembly, Japan announced its intention to move forward in China
 san 1933 main report vidhansabha main 42-1 ke bahumat se paarit hui, parantu china se apni sena hataane ke bajaay, japan ne sangh se apni sadsyta waapas le lee
 According to the manifesto, the United Nations should have responded by imposing economic sanctions on Japan, or should have gathered the military and declared war against it
 haalanki inamen se koi bhi kaarywahi kii nahin gai
 The threat of an economic embargo became almost useless because the United States was not a UN member
 kisi bhi prakaar kaa aarthik pratibandh sangh apane sadsy rajyon par aropit karata tha vah aprabhavi ho jaataa tha, kyonki jab ek sadsy raashtra ko dusre sadsy raashtra ke saath vyapaar karne ke liye pratibandhit kiya jaataa tha to vah sanyukt rajya america ke saath vyapaarik sambandh sthapit kar letaa tha
 The League of Nations could gather an army, but major powers such as Britain and France were also complicit in their own affairs, such as control of their vast empire, especially after the upheavals of the First World War
 Manchuria was therefore left under Japanese control until the Soviet Union's Red Army captured the area and returned it to China after World War II

 In December of 1935, the hoare-lavelle Treaty was an attempt by British Foreign Minister Samuel Hoare and French Prime Minister Pierre Lavelle to end the conflict in Abyssinia, which proposed to divide the country into two parts - an Italian territory and An Abyssinia region
 Mussolini agreed to the treaty, but news of the deal was leaked, as a result the French and British public strongly opposed it and called the treaty an offer to sell Abyssinia
 Hoare and Lavelle were forced to resign from their posts and both the British and French governments separated from their respective peoples

 The situation was the same with Japan, the major powers' enthusiasm in dealing with the crisis of Abyssinia was not due to their belief that the fate of this poor and remote country which was inhabited by non-europeans could not be the subject of their central interest
 Huh

 On 17 July 1936, the Spanish Army began a state-uprising, leading to a long-term armed conflict between the Spanish Republicans and the nationalists

 The Allies were also bound by the Treaty of Versailles to try to disarm and the arms embargo that was imposed on the defeated nations was described as the first attempt towards worldwide disarmament

 The members of the Sangh had different views on disarmament
 francisi apane shastron ko is guarantee ke bina kam karne ke liye anicchhuk the ki unpar akraman hone par sainik sahaayta mili
 Poland and Czechoslovakia felt insecure on the west side and wanted the members to be strengthened before aggressive action by the union and disarming them
 Without this guarantee, they would not reduce their weapons because they felt that the threat of invasion from Germany was too high

 This problem stemmed mainly from the fact that the main members of the League of Nations were not prepared to accept the possibility that their destiny would be decided by other countries and therefore, consequently, gave themselves the power to veto by implementing a unanimous vote

 Although it intended to include all nations, many never joined, or their partnership with the Union was too small

 Ruth Henning suggested that if the US had been a member of the Union, it would have supported France and Britain as well, presumably France would have felt more secure and such encouragement would have allowed France and Britain to cooperate more with Germany and this would lead to Nazi The rise of the party would have been less possible

 The structure of government in the US would have also made its membership problematic because its representatives in the Union would not have taken any decision on behalf of the American executive branches without the prior approval of its legislative branches

 Foreign Office Minister Sir Eyre Crowe also wrote a memorandum to the British Cabinet claiming that "a serious union and contract" would be just "a treaty like other treaties": "what is there to ensure that it Won't break like other treaties? "
 Crowe expressed skepticism about the "pledge of common action" against the invaders because he believed that the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power
 He criticized the union's proposal for economic sanctions because it would be ineffective and was "a question of genuine military prominence"
 Crowe warned that universal disarmament was a practical impossibility

 This session concerned the liquefaction of the Union itself: in 1946 approximately $ 22,000,000 worth of property was given to the United States, including the Palace of Peace and the Archives of the Union, the reserves were returned to the countries that supplied them and Union debt was repaid

 The decisions of the United Nations Security Council are binding on all members of the United Nations, however, unlike the Union Council, consensus decisions are not required
 Permanent members of the UN Security Council are also given a shield to protect their vital interests, which has prevented the UN from acting decisively in many cases

 Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or in-depth code review, unit testing of the entire code, refraining from programming until the features are really needed, a flat management structure, simplicity and clarity in the code , Expecting change in consumer requirements as time passes and better understanding of the problem and with the consumer and the program Frequent communication between s

 Extreme programming was created by Kent Beck during his work on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System salary payment project

 Software development in the 1990s was shaped primarily by two things: object-oriented programming was replaced by programming programming as a programming paradigm preferred internally by some in the industry; Externally, the rise of the Internet and the dot-com boom emphasized market-to-boom and company-growth as competitive factors

 Taking advantage of this opportunity, he proposed and implemented some changes in his practices, which were based on his work with his regular colleague Ward Cunningham

 The high amount of discipline required for basic methods often deviated from its path, leading to some of these methods, which seemed too strict, to be criticized or left incomplete in their places

 In the second edition of Extreme Programming Extended, Beck added some new values and methods and explained the difference between primary and auxiliary methods

 In traditional system development methods or waterfall models) the requirements of the system are determined at the beginning of the development project and often they remain constant from that point forward

 Like other methods of rapid software development, XP also seeks to reduce the cost of change, using multiple short development cycles rather than one large development cycle
 is siddhant ke anusaar parivartan software vikaas pariyojnaon kaa ek swaabhaavik, aprihaary or vaanchit pahalu hai or aavashyaktaaon ke ek sthir samucchy ko paribhaashit karne kaa prayaas karne ke bajaay unki purti ke liye niyojan kiya janaa chaiye
 Extreme programming also introduced a number of fundamental values, principles and methods on top of the rapid programming framework
 ekspe software vikaas prakriya ke bheetar kii jane vaali chaar moolbhoot gatividhiyon kaa varnan karti he
 Proponents of XP argue that code — software instructions that computers can understand, is the only genuinely important product of the system development process
 code ke bina, koi bhi kaary utpaada nahin hota
 Coding can also be used to find the most appropriate solution
 udhaaharan ke liye, ekspe is baat kaa samarthan karegaa ki kisi programing samasya ke liye vibhinn vikalp uplabdh hone par, vyakti ko sabhi samaadhaanon kii koding kerani chaiye or swachaalit pareekshanon ke dwaara yah nirdhaarit karnaa chaiye ki koun sa samaadhaan sarvaadhik upyukt he
 Coding is also helpful in communicating ideas about programming problems
 yadi koi programmer kisi jatil programing samasya kaa saamana kar rahaa ho or apane sahyogi programmeron ko iskaa samaadhaan samajha paane main kathinaayee mahasoos kar rahaa ho, to vah isaki koding karke yah pradarshit kar saktaa he ki vah kya kahana chahta he
 The code, which we can call a proposer of this situation, is always clear and concise and cannot be interpreted more than once
 Other programmers can also provide their feedback on this code by coding their ideas
 jab tak kisi function kaa pareekshan na kiya jaae, tab tak nishchit rup se yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vah kaary karata he
 Bugs and design errors are widespread problems in software development
 extream programing kaa maarg yah he ki yadi pareekshan kii thodi-si maatra kuch dosha ko dur kar sakati he, to adhik maatra main pareekshan karne par ham bahut adhik dosha ko mitaa sakate hai
 a "testathon" is an event in which programmers meet for collaborative test writing, a form of discussion in the context of software testing
 programmer ke liye is baat ko sunanaa anivaary hota he ki upabhokta system se kya kaary karwaanaa chahta he, kis "vyapaar tark" kii aavashyaktaa he
 They must understand these requirements so well that they can give feedback to the consumer about why the problem can be resolved or why it cannot be resolved
 The dialogue between the consumer and the programmer is further noted in the planning game
 saadagi ke drushtikon se, ham avashya hi yah kah sakate hai ki pranali vikaas ke liye koding, pareekshan or shravan paryaapt hai
 If those activities are done well, we always get a working system as a result
 parantu vyaavhaarik rup se, yah kaary nahin karegaa
 Even without design, a person can go a long way, but at a particular point he will get stuck
 The system becomes too complex and the dependencies within the system are not clear
 system main prayukt tark ko vyavasthit rup se rakhanevaali ek dizine sanrachana kaa nirmaan karke isse bachaa ja saktaa he
 Good design can avoid many dependencies within a system; This means that making changes to one part of the system will not affect the other parts
 prarambh main 1999 main extream programing ne chaar mulyon ko manyata di
 The second version of Extreme Programming Xpland added a new value
 ye paanch mulya hai: In order to build a software system, it is necessary to communicate the requirements of the system to the developers of the system
 aupchaarik software vikaas karypranaliyon main, yah kaary dastavejikaran ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Extreme programming techniques can be seen as methods for rapidly building and disseminating institutional knowledge among development team members
 iskaa lakshya sabhi vikasakartaaon ko system kaa ek saajha drishy pradaan karnaa hota he, jo ki system ke prayokta dwaara soche gayi drishy se mail khaataa ho
 To this end, Extreme Programming supports simple designs, common features, mutual support of users and programmers, regular verbal communication and feedback
 extream programing sabase saral samaadhaan ke saath shuruyaat karne ko protsaahit karti he
 Additional functionality can be added later
 is vidhi or system vikaas kii adhik paaramparik vidhiyon ke bich antar yah he ki isamen kal, agle saptaah, yaa agle maah kii aavashyaktaaon ke bajaay aaj kii aavashyaktaaon ke liye dizining va koding karne par dhyaan kendrit kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes it is called the "you are not going to need it" method in a nutshell
 ekspe ke samarthak is kami ko maanate hai ki kabhi-kabhi iske kaaran bhavishya main system main parivartan karne ke liye adhik prayaas karnaa pad saktaa he; unka tark yah he ki is kami kii purti is laabh ke dwaara ho jaati he ki hamen un bhavi aavashyaktaaon main nivesh nahin karnaa padataa, jo praasangik ban paane se purv parivartit ho sakati hai
 In coding and designing for uncertain needs of the future, there is a risk that our resources are being spent for such a thing, which may not be needed
 Regarding the "dialogue" value, the quality of the dialogue should be improved by the ease of design and coding
 bahut hi saral code ke saath ek saral dizine ko dal ke adhikansh programmeron dwaara saralata se samajha ja saktaa he
 Under extreme programming, feedback is related to various dimensions of system development : samvaad or saralata ke saath feedback kaa nikat sambandh hota he
 Faults present in the system can be easily communicated by writing a unit test that proves that a specific piece of code will break
 Direct feedback from the system lets the programmers know that this part has to be re-coded
 samay-samay par upabhokta kaaryaatmak aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar system kaa pareekshan kar paane main sakasham hota he, jinhen prayokta kathaayen kehete hai
 In the words of Kent Beck, "optimism is an occupational hazard of programming and feedback is its treatment
 " Many methods involve courage
 inamen se ek yah niyam he ki dizining or koding sadaiv hi aaj ke liye kerani chaiye, na ki aane vaale kal ke liye
 This is an attempt to avoid getting bogged down in the design and the need to put in a lot of effort to implement something else
 saahas vikasakartaaon ko aavashyaktaa ke anusaar apane code kii punarrachana ke kaary ke dauraan sahaj mahasoos kar paane main sakasham banaata he
 This means reviewing and revising the current system so that future changes can be implemented more easily
 saahas kaa ek anya udhaaharan is baad ko jaananaa he ki code ko kab hataa dena he: anupayogi strot code ko hataane kaa saahas, bhale hi us strot code ke nirmaan main chaahe kitni hi zyada mehnat kyon na lagi ho
 At the same time, courage also means perseverance: a programmer may be stuck in a complex problem all day and solve it very quickly the next day, but this is possible only when he is firm
 sammaan mulya main dusron ke liye sammaan ke saath hi aatm-sammaan bhi shaamil hota he
 Programmers should never make changes that break compilation, that make current unit-tests fail, or that otherwise delay the work of their peers
 sadaiv ucch gunvattta kaa prayaas karke or uplabdh samaadhaan ke liye punarrachana ke dwaara sarvshereshth dizine banane kaa prayaas karke sadsy apane swayan ke kaary kaa sammaan karte hai
 Adopting the last four values results in respect from other team members
 team ke kisi sadsy ko yah mahasoos nahin hona chaiye ki uski prashansa nahin kii jaati yaa uski upeksha kii ja rahi he
 This ensures a high level of motivation and encourages loyalty to the team and to the goal of the project
 yah mulya anya mulyon par atyadhik nirbhar hota he or team ke logon kii ore bahut adhik abhimukh hota he
 The first version of xp's rules was proposed by Ken Ayer in XP / Agile Universe 2003
 unhone yah mahasoos kiya ki ekspe ko iske niyamon ke dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya tha, na ki isaki paddatiyon ke dwaara 
 He defined two categories: "rules of work", which describe the environment in which software development can be effectively carried out, and "rules of the game", which under the framework of rules of work are minute- Defines activities and rules to be done by the minute
 isiesai 2008 sammelan kii epso kaaryshaala main, mehadi mirakhorali ne extream programing kaa ek nayaa or adhik spasht va vishad sanskaran prastaavit kiya, jo ki paddatiyon se adhik swatantra tha or jiskaa adhik "teevr" hona abhisht tha
 According to Mehdi Mirakhorli, these are: jo siddhant ekspe kaa aadhaar banaate hai, ve abhi-abhi varnit mulyon par aadhaarit hote hai or unka uddeshy ek system vikaas pariyojna main nirnyon ko protsaahit karnaa hota he
 Principles should be firmer than values and in any practical situation they should be more easily translated into a guidance
 extream programing main feedback ko sarvaadhik upyogi mana jaataa he, yadi ise tivrata se kiya gaya ho or yah is baat ko vyakt karata ho ki kisi kaary or iske feedback ke bich kaa samay seekhney or parivartan karne ke liye bahut adhik mahatvapurn hota he
 Unlike traditional system development methods, the consumer is frequently approached in short-term cycles
 viksit kiye ja rahe system ke bare main upabhokta ke paas ek spasht antardrushti hoti he
 He can give his feedback and can also conduct the development as required
 ikai pareekshan bhi teevr feedback siddhant ke prati sahaayak hote hai
 When writing code, unit testing provides direct feedback on how the system responds to changes once changes have been made
 udaahranarth, yadi parivartan system ke kisi aise bhaag ko prabhavit karte hon, jo unhen banane vaale programmer ke daayre main nahin aata, to vah programmer us dosha ko nahin dekh sakegaa
 It is highly likely that this error will be present when the system is produced
 iske antargat prayek samasya ke saath yah maanakar kaary kiya jaataa he ki vah "atyadhik saral" he
 Traditional system development methods call for planning for the future and writing code for reuse
 extream programing in vichaaron ko asweekaar karti he
 Extreme programming proponents say that it is not appropriate to make big changes all at once
 extream programing vriddhishil parivartanon ko lagu karti he: udhaaharan ke liye, prayek teen saptaah baad kisi system ke chote sanskaran ko release kiya ja saktaa he
 When many small steps are made, the consumer has more control of the development process and the system being developed
 parivartan ko apnaane kaa siddhant parivartanon ke vipareet kaam na karne or unhen sweekaar karne se sambandhit he
 For example, if during one of the staged meetings it appears that consumer requirements have changed dramatically, programmers accept this and plan new requirements for the next phase
 extream programing main 12 paddatiyon kaa varnan kiya gaya he, jo chaar kshetron main samoohbaddh kii gayi hai: There has been a lot of controversy over xp's methodology, with strong views expressed in support and opposition to the use of XP
 extream programing ke samarthakon kaa daawa he ki upabhokta kii aavashyaktaaon main parivartan ke nivedan anaupchaarik rup se kaary-sthal par hi praapt ho jane ke kaaran yah prakriya adhik lacheelee banati he or iske kaaran aupchaarik kharch kii laagat bachati he
 Critics of XP claim that this can result in costly rework, and gradually the scope of the project goes beyond the limits previously agreed upon or funded
 parivartan niyantran board is baat kaa sanket hai ki pariyojna ke uddeshyon or baadhaon ke bare main anek prayoktaaon ke bich takaraav sambhavit hai
 xp's rapid functioning depends to some extent on how programmers are able to visualize a unified view of the consumer, so that programmers can focus their attention on coding rather than documenting the objectives and constraints of the agreement
 This also applies when multiple coding organizations are involved, particularly organizations that continue to compete on the share of projects
 extream programing ke sambhavit rup se vivaadaaspad anya pahaluon main shaamil hai: Historically, XP only serves groups of twelve or fewer people
 pariyojna ko chote bhaagon main todna or phir chote samoohon main team bananaa is seemaa ko dhokhaa dene kaa ek upaay he
 It has been claimed that XP has been used successfully on groups of more than a hundred members
 thotworks ne daawa kiya he ki unhone vitarit ekspe pariyojnaon par saath logon tak kii sankhya vaale samoohon ke saath kaary karke paryaapt safalataa pai he
 In 2004, industrial extreme programming was introduced as an extension of XP
 iskaa uddeshy bade or vitarit samoohon main kaary karne kii kshamta pradaan karnaa he
 It now has 23 methods and flexible pricing
 chunki yah azeil parivaar kaa nayaa sadsy he, atah isaki upyogita siddh karne ke liye abhi paryaapt data uplabdh nahin he, haalanki, yah daawa kiya jaataa he ki yah us baat kaa jawaab he, jise ekspe kii kami mana jaataa he
 In 2003, Matt Stephens and Duff Rossenberg published Extreme Programming Reacted: The Case Against XP, which questioned the value of the XP process and suggested some ways to improve it
 This led to a long debate in articles, Internet news groups and web-site chat areas
 is pustak kaa mul tark yah he ki ekspe kii paddatiyaan antahnirbhar hai, parantu kuch hi vyaavhaarik sanghathan in sabhi paddatiyon ko apnaane ke icchhuk / sakasham hai; atah puri prakriya vifal ho jaati he
 This book also makes other criticisms and presents xp's model of "collective ownership" in a negative form of equality with socialism
 pustak extream programing reffactard ke prakaashan ke baad se ekspe ke kuch pahaluon main parivartan hua he; vishisht rup se, ekspe ab paddatiyon main tab tak sanshodhano ko anukool banaata he, jab tak ki aavashyak uddeshyon kii purti hoti rahe
 The use of common terminology for processes in XP is also increasing
 kuch logon kaa tark he ki ye parivartan pichhali aalochanaon ko amaanya bana dete hai; kuch anya log daawa karte hai ki yah keval prakriya ko seenchne kaa prayaas he
 The RDP method is a technique for using extreme programming to suit your needs

 dev-d is a Hindi romantic drama film released on 6 February 2009
 film kaa lekhan or nirdesan anuraag kashyap ne kiya he
 The film is the modern version of Sharad Chandra Chattopadhyay's periodical Bengali novel Devdas
 iske alaava is upanyaas par aadhaarit anya filmein pi si bruva, bimal roy or sanjay lila bhansaali bana chuke hai
 The film was well received by critics and the public and for the manner in which it introduced itself, it was considered one of the path breaking films in Hindi
 dev ek amir punjabi vyavsaayee kaa betaa he
 He and Paro have been attracted to each other since childhood
 lekin dev, ek asurakshit ugr swabhaav kaa vyakti hone ke kaaran, uske prati apana sneh ore suraksha darshane ke bajaay faaltu baton par paro ko pareshaan karata he
 The film is based on contemporary Punjab and Delhi where family ties are ignored in the face of paternal traditions and marriages have become merely a game of ability and "respect"
 dev ko ucch shiksha ke liye landan bhej diya jaataa he, jab uske pita ko yah mahasoos hota he ki unka betaa itnaa bighad gaya he
 But, when away from each other, the love between Paro and Dev begins to blossom like a flower
 yani ve mahasoos karte hai ki ve ek duusare se pyaar karte hai
 Dev reaches Chandigarh to meet Paro
 pyaar karne kaa yah prayaas kuch andhere hasya palon kaa nirmaan karata he
 Such seeds of doubt are sown at this time, from which this couple will never recover in their life
 jab dev paro ke bare main afvaahen sunata he, vah un par turant vishwaas kar letaa he or paro ko chhod detaa he
 This creates a suspicion between them and necessarily brings such a male feeling about how a woman should behave sexually
 paro jab yah sunati he ki dev ne uskaa apmaan kiya he, vah use chhod kar laut aati he or uske mata-pita ne uske liye jise chunaa he, usase shaadi karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaati he
 On the day of her wedding, she realizes that these rumors were false
 lekin apane ahankaar ke kaaran, vah apni galati ko sweekaar nahin karata he or use kisi or se shaadi karne detaa he
 Chanda's entry, this section explains the infamous sex MMS scandal of Delhi
 jab uske pita apni beti kii khoyi pratishtha se apamaanit mahasoos karte hai, ve aatmahatya kar lete hai
 He is abandoned by his family
 film main yah darshaya gaya he ki kaise vah apane aap ko ek nirdosh schuli chaatra se ek veshya main tabdeel kar leti he
 Although Chanda is not a prostitute by profession, she is not completely isolated
 mujra pradarshit karne ke bajaay, vah lokapriy america shrinkhalaa ke ashleel drishyon kaa pradarshan karti he
 One thing that makes him different is that he has not left his studies for the profession and his exit door is also open
 dev paro kii shaadi se bahut pareshaan ho jaataa he or sharaab or nashile padaarthon kaa seven karne lagata he
 He leaves Chandigarh in search of his lost love and comes to Delhi, makes every effort to escape his father
 kuch maah baad, dev aadhi raat ko paro ke pati ko phone karata he, jiske baad paro dev se milane jaati he
 Paro has accepted her fate, but her heart still beats for her childhood sweetheart
 uskaa pyaar hameshaa dekhbhaal main badal jaataa he
 On the other hand, Dev demands more than love - especially physical love - and this is where his luck does not support him
 paro kaa yah maananaa he judaai ke bajaay ki kisi or se pyaar karnaa uske liye dukh kaa kaaran he
 Ironically, her life always revolves around women
 us par dabaav he ki vah ek se apana vinaash kar le or duusare ke dwaara chhod diya jaye
 In the end, he realizes that he was wrong and that he has never truly loved Paro
 vah chanda ke paas laut jaataa he or uske saath rahane lagata he
 The film's original idea was suggested by Abhay Deol to Anurag Kashyap, who worked on the screenplay with Vikramaditya Motwani and gave the film a youthful feel "using news headlines about Generation X"
 It was produced by Ronnie Screwvala, its shooting took place at many places including Paharganj in central Delhi

 Talking about Dev's role and the story, Abhay Deol told Radio Sargam, "the majority of the story is from a book i read in English
 " maine is bhoomika ko kitaab main di gayi meri vyakhya ke anusaar nibhaayaa he
 His character was contemporary, he was quite urban in many ways, he is lost and spoiled somewhere in the surrounding environment, his personality is extreme and he is addictive

 But according to sources, UTV had signed Abhay for three projects and the actor was busy with Kashyap's films from November 2007 to March 2008, as the program was designed to complete the film at the same time
 When the film debuted, it was rumored that UTV backed out
 us samay, nirdeshak ne is baat kaa khandan kiya ki UTV peeche hat gaya he
 He explained the reason for the delay that once his previous film Hanuman Returns is completed, after that he will be able to work on this film
 He said that they are still searching for their Chandramukhi and have signed Abhay and Mahi Gill for it
