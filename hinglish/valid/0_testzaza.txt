 There are two distinctions of experience - neglectful and non-observant
 jo anubhav apane vishay kaa koi sanskaar daale bina hi villin ho jaataa he use "upekshaatmak anubhav" tathaa jo anubhav apane vishay kaa sanskaar utpann kar nasht hota he use "anupekshaatmak" anubhav kaha jaataa he
 In the course of time, the same awareness of the same experience that is created by the awakening of this rite is called "remembrance"
 samaran kii yatharthata or ayatharthata anubhav kii yatharthata or ayatharthata par nirbhar hoti he
 Recollection is considered to be different from both proof and confusion, because he must assume additional proof for it if he believes the proof and additional defect in the form due to it, which is not proper
 pratybhigna - dharapravahee pratyakshgyaan ko "pratybhigna" kaha jaataa he
 It originates from the combined trade of culture and sense
 purvadrisht evam drishyman padaarth kii ekta kaa graahak hone se vahi sthaayee padaarth kii satta main pramaan hota he
 When the mind is observant of a subject from the contiguity of the combined senses, as long as the senses of the senses and the senses of the senses remain with that subject, immunity becomes a new new perception of that subject
 is pratyaksh samooh ko hi dharawahi gyaan kaha jaataa he
 This knowledge is also considered to be pragmatic because the subject is unobstructed
 anyathaakhyati - janya saviklpak gyaan ke do bhed hote hai- prama or bhram
 Another name for confusion is "otherwise known"
 iske teen bhed hote hai- sanshay viparyay or aarope
 In the same intention, a knowledge of two opposing substances is called "sambhaya", such as "word: Nityo na va"
 kisi vastu main anya vastu ke dharm kaa nishchay "viparyay" kaha jaataa he, jaise surya ke prakaash main chamakati seepi main chandeepan kaa gyaan
 The knowledge arising out of the will of the knower while possessing opposing knowledge is called "accusation" or "dietary", such as a thug selling a hand to a clown by telling Ranga the silver, despite knowing the lack of silverness in the ranga, it willfully contains silveriness Knowledge
 in anya vyaakhyatiyon kii upapatti karne ke liye hi nyaayashastra main "gyanalakshan" alokik sannikarsh kii kalpana kii gai he
 Autonomy, paratastattva - the knowledge of knowledge and illusion are two distinctions
 unki utpatti tathaa pramaatv yaa bhramatv rup se unki jeapti ke bare main bhinn bhinn darshanon ke bhinn bhinn mat hai, kintu nyaayashastra main yah baat maani gai he ki prama kii utpatti swat: arthath gyaan saamaanya ke kaaran maatr se na hokar gunatmak kaaran kii sahaayta se hoti he or bhram kii utpatti swat: na hokar doshaatmak kaaran kii sahaayta se hoti he
 In the same way, the knowledge of the principal and illusion of knowledge also comes from the knowledge of the self, that is, not the mere causal nature of the knowledge, but the knowledge of the principle is "successful propitious inference" and illusionism is "unsuccessful predictive"
 jis gyaan se honevaali pravriti safal arthath gyaat vishay kii prapika hoti he, use prama samajha jaataa he or jis gyaan se honevaali pravriti vifal arthath gyaat vishay kii prapika nahin hoti, use bhram kaha jaataa he
 In the known disciplines of jurisprudence, debate, jalp and vitanda also have an important place
 in teenon ko vatsyayan ne apane nyaaybhashya main "katha" shabd se vyavahrut kiya he
 Katha means the mutual views of scholars on a subject which are available in the form of pleadings, jalp and vittanda
 tatv nirnay ke uddeshy se kiye janevaale vichaar ko "vaad" evam pratidwandvi par vijay praapt karne ke uddeshy se kiye janevaale vichaar ko "jalp" tathaa "vitanda" kaha jaataa he
 The use of "deceit" and "caste" in the Promising Thought and "aphasiddhanta" is considered to be the emergence of additional lesser places from "inferior", "more" and "fallacy"
 is vichaar main sabha, madhyasth evam raja yaa rajpratinidhi kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 The scholars who participate in it are not avinavantavanchak, asuwanya or obstinate
 shuddh nyaay se tatvanirnay par pahunchnaa hi uskaa lakshya hota he
 There is no sense of Jayaparajaya among the thinkers
 jalp or vitanda kaa swabhaav vaad se paryaapt bhinn he
 The aim of the scholars who participate in these ideas is not to decide, but to prove themselves victorious by making their opponent silent
 isiilie in vichaaron main chal or jati ke prayog tathaa sabhi prakaar ke nigrah sthanon ke udbhaavna kii kaat rahati he, saath hi vichaar ke nirvighn sanchaalan ke liye sabha, madhyasth or rajkeey niyantran kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 There is a lot of difference in their nature even when there is a unity between the purpose of Jalpa and Vitanda
 jaise jalp main vaadi or prativaadee donon apane apane paksh kaa saadhan or parapaksh kaa khandan karte hai, par vitanda main keval vaadi hi apane paksh ke saadhan kaa prayaas karata he, prativaadee vaadi ke paksh kaa khandan karne main hi apni krutharthata maanakar apane paksh kii sthapana tathaa uske saadhan ke prayaas se virat rahata he
 The "litigation" for elemental judgment and "jalp" and defense of vitanda are considered to be useful for protecting the decided element
 ye vishay bhi nyaayashastra ke pramukh vishyon main hai
 a knowledge of deceit is necessary to protect his side from the defendant's fraudulent attack
 vaadi ke paksh kaa khandan karne ke liye uske vachan main uske anbhimat arth kii kalpana ko "chal" kaha jaataa he
 There are three distinctions of deceit - prevarication, general care and treatment
 swayan "jati" ke prayog se bachane ke liye tathaa prativaadee dwaara "jati" kaa prayog hone par uskaa asaduttaratv ghoshit karne kii kshamta praapt karne ke liye "jati" kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 In the absence of coverage, "caste" is the name to show fault in favor of the plaintiff only with the virtue or validness: jati ke choubees bhed hai - Knowledge of possession is necessary to protect yourself from falling into the confinement and to qualify the defendant to be admitted by directing the Declaration upon reaching the defendant's sanctuary
 iske baees bhed hai- pratigyaahani, pratigyaantar, pratigyavirodh, pratigyasanyas, hetvantar, arthantar, nirarthak, avigyatarth, aparthak, apraptkaal, nune, adhik, punarukt, ananubhaashan, agyaan, apratibha, vikshep, matanugna, paryanuyojyopekshan, niranuyojyanuyog, apsiddhant or hetvabhaas
 In order to know the characteristics and examples of the above distinctions of deceit, caste and the place of birth, one should look at the second Ahrik and Pancha Chapters of the first chapter of the judiciary and the judge of Vatsyayana on them
 aatma - jo davy chaitanya aashray hota he, use aatma kaha jaataa he
 He has two distinctions - Jeevatma and Paramatma
 paramatma- paramatma kaa hi naam ishwar he
 He is another comprehensive
 gyaan, ichha or praytn uske vishesh gun hai or ve sabhi nity thitha sarvavishyak hai
 God creates the world according to the auspicious, inauspicious deeds of living beings
 sristi ke aarambh main jeevon ke hitarth vedon kaa nirmaan karata he
 The Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras arrange these four varnas and the four ashrams of Brahmacharya, Garhastya, Vanaprastha and Sannyas impart education to the people of Varnashrama Dharma and various other types of folk behavior
 vahi jagat kaa srashta hone se brahma, paalak hone se vishnu tathaa sanharta hone se rudra naam se vyavahrut hota he
 He is obsessed with inference and scripture
 kadachit uskaa pratyaksh bhi hota he, par vah keval siddh yogi ko hi
 The number of souls is infinite
 prayek jeev vyapak tathaa gyaan, ichha, praytn aadi vishesh gunon kaa aashray or un gunon ke saath man dwaara pratyaksh vedya he
 Every living being is bounded from time immemorial by virtue of lustful deeds and lust for a variety of experiences
 dev, daanav, yaksha, gandharva, manushya, pashu, pakshi, saanp, bichchhu, keede, makode, lata, vanaspati aadi vividh char-achar yoniyon main uskaa janm hota rahata he
 He does not get rid of the said bondage and emotional sorrow when he does not become an element of God and spirit
 moksh - nyaayashastra main ikkis prakaar ke du:kha maane gaye hai
 These six senses are olfactory, eye, skin, brain and mind; Smell, rasa, form, touch, word and raga are special defects; these six subjects; Six subject experiences, body pleasure and grief resulting from contact with the subordinates - the last of these "griefs" is the main sorrow due to nature being malice, but happiness is due to being attached to the main grief and other nineteen
 Because of being the father of the main sorrows, there are minor sorrows - the only name to get rid of these twenty-one sorrows forever is "moksha"
 mokshasaadhan - saddharm ke anushthan se "chitt kaa shodhan" "padaarthon kaa tatv gyaan" tathaa "aatma ke vaastavik swaroop kaa pratyaksh bodh" ye teen moksh ke saadhan hai
 With the devotion of routine, casual and nishkam karma, and by the everlasting ritual, when a man refines his mind, he becomes disenchanted with the subjects of the world, as a result of which he is aware of the substances of the world, especially the divine and self
 us jigyaasa se prerit hokar vah sadguru ke charnon main pahunch, usase shasr kaa adhyayan kar pramaan,
 prameya aadi solah padaarthon kaa - jinka nyaay - vaisheshik ke marmajna vidwaanon ne dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh, samavaay or abhaav in saat padaarthon main antarbhaav kar liya he - tatvagyan arjeet karata he
 By attaining eternal meditation, nididhyasana and long-term uninterrupted practice, the divine supernatural psyche of the divine and the cosmic psyche of a special deity-free soul is attained by attaining life before the order stated in the second sutra of justice philosophy, that is, in life itself, free from all bondage
 Goes and after the destiny karma ends by enjoyment, relationship with the present body Odkr receives Videhmukti
 pun: kabhi kisi bhi rup main uskaa janm nahin hota or vah ishwar ke samaan nitant nirdu:kha ho apane nisargasiddh shuddh shaashvat rup main sadaa ke liye pratishthit ho jaataa he

 Franz Kafka was a twentieth-century German writer of culturally influential, short stories and novels
 unki rachanaadan aadhunik samaaj ke vyagr algaav ko chitrit karatin hai
 Contemporary critics and academics, including Vladimir Nabokov, believe that Kafka is one of the best writers of the 20th century
 "kafkaesque" angreji bhashaa kaa hissaa ban gaya he jiskaa upyog 'bahakaanewaala','khatarnaak jatilta' aadi ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he
 In an article for the New Yorker, John Updike explained: "when Kafka was born, ideas of modernism began to flourish in that century - as in the midst of centuries a new self-consciousness, new-born consciousness was born
 
 apni mrityu ke itane saal baad bhi, kafka aadhunik vichaardhaara ke ek pahalu ke pratik he - chintaa or shame kii us anubhuti ke jise sthit nahin kiya ja saktaa he isliye shant nahin kiya ja saktaa he; chizon ke bheetar ek anant kathinaayee kii bhaavana ke, jo har kadam baadha dalti he; upyogita se pare teevr samvedansheeltaa ke, jaise ki saamaajik upyog or dharmik vishwaas kii apni puraani twachaa ke chhin jane par us sharir ke samaan jise har sparsh se pidaa ho
 This terrible quality of Kafka's strange and highly original case was full of his softness, quirky and good humor, some serious and assured formality
 yah sangyojan unhe ek kalakaar banaata he, par unhone apni kala kii keemat ke rup main adhik se adhik bheetar pratirodh or adhik gambhir sanshay ke khilaaf sangharsh kiya he
 Some of Kafka's most popular works are - Inquisition, a hunger-artist, etc
 kafka kaa janm praha, bohemia main, ek madhyam varg ke, german bhashi yahudee parivaar main hua
 Kafka's father, Harmann Kafka, ran a dry goods shop in the ghetto, and Kafka's mother, Julie, supported him
 unke pita ko vishaal, swaarthee, dabang vyapaaree kaha jaataa tha
 Kafka himself stated that his father was "a true Kafka in strength, health, hunger, height of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind and knowledge of human nature"

 isse uskaa adhikansh jivan maharaja prithviraj chouhan ke saath dilli main beetaa tha
 The capital and the battlefield were with Prithviraj everywhere

 Therefore, Chandavardai is considered the first great poet of Braj Bhasha Hindi
 'raso' kii rachana maharaj prithviraj ke yuddh-varnan ke liye hui he
 It describes their heroic wars and love affairs
 at: isamen vir or shringaar do hi ras he
 Chandabardai has composed this book like an eyewitness, but it is clear from the inscription evidence that there is an unknown poet who completes this work by describing the last moments of Chand and Prithviraj
 chandbardaai ko hindi kaa pehla kavi or unki rachana prithviraj raso ko hindi kii pehali rachana hone kaa sammaan praapt he
 Prithviraj Raso is the largest poetry book in Hindi
 isamen 10,000 se adhik chand hai or tatkaaleen prachlit 6 bhashaaon kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Detailed information about North Indian Kshatriya society and their traditions is found in this book, due to this it is also very important from a historical point of view
 ve bharat ke antim hindu samraat prithviraj chouhan tritiy ke mitra tathaa raajakavi the
 Prithviraj ruled Ajmer and Delhi from 1165 to 1192
 yahi chandbardaai kaa rachanakaal bhi tha
 His life was so mixed with the life of Prithviraj that it cannot be separated
 yuddh main, akhet main, sabha main, yatra main, sadaa maharaj ke saath rahete the or jahaan jo baaten hoti thim, sab main sammilit rahete the
 Even when Mohammad Ghori defeated Prithviraj Chauhan and took him captive to Ghazni, he could not control himself and went to Ghazni
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kaid main band prithviraj ko jab andhaa kar diya gaya to unhen is avasthaa main dekh kar inkaa hriday dravit ho gaya evam inhone gori ke vadh kii yojana banaayi
 Under the said scheme, he first won the heart of Ghori and then told Ghori that Prithviraj could wield a wrenching arrow
 isse prabhavit hokar mohammad gori ne prithviraj kii is kala ko dekhne kii ichha prakat kii
 On the day of the performance Chand Baradiyi sat on the stage with Ghori
 andhe prithviraj ko maidan main laayaa gaya evam unase apni kala kaa pradarshan karne ko kaha gaya
 As Prithviraj shot an arrow over an hour, Ghori's mouth suddenly said "wow! Wow !!" The word came out just what was it again
 Chandbardiyi immediately told Prithviraj in a couplet that where Ghori was sitting and at what height
 vah doha is prakaar tha: Four bamboo twenty four yards, Angul Ashta Praman! Ta Sultan is up, Chauhan does not miss out !! is prakaar chand bardaai kii sahaayta se se prithviraj ke dwaara gori kaa vadh kar diya gaya

 In today's scientific age, no country can live separately
 in deshon main parsparik sambandh jodna aaj ke yug main aavashyak ho gaya he
 Qualified individuals are sent from one country to another to connect these relations
 ye vyakti apni yogyata, kushalta or kootneeti se duusare desh ko praayah mitra bana lete hai
 Even in ancient times, one state used to send its diplomats to connect diplomatic relations with another state
 pehle kootneeti kaa arth 'saude main yaa len dein main vaakya chaaturi, chal-prapanch, dhokhaa-dhadi' lagaaya jaataa tha
 a person who used to get maximum benefits for his country by paying a lower price was called a skilled diplomat
 parantu aaj chal-prapanch ko kootneeti nahin kaha jaataa he
 Scientifically, in modern times the term is used for peaceful settlement in two states
 diplomasi ke liye hindi main kootneeti ke sthaan par rajnay shabd kaa prayog hone laga he
 The international world has become like a family
 parivaar ke sadasyon main prem, sahyog, sadbhaavna tathaa mitrataa kaa sambandh jodna ek kushal rajanyajna kaa kaam he
 The word 'rajnay' is a Hindi translation of the English word 'diplomacy'
 diplomasi shabd kii utpatti greek bhashaa ke diploun shabd se hui he jiskaa arth modana athwa doharaa karnaa he
 The Roman Empire developed after the fall of the Greek states
 roman samrajya main passport evam sadakon par chalane ke anumati patr aadi dohare karke sil diye jate the
 These passports and permission cards were inscribed on metal letters
 inako 'diploma' kaha jaataa tha
 Gradually, the term diploma was used for all government papers
 videshiyon ke visheshadhikaar athwa unmukti evam videshi sandhiyon sambandhi kagajaat bhi 'diploma' kahe jane lage
 When the number of these treaties became more, they were kept in safe places
 ye sthaan baad main 'rajkeey abhilekhagaaron' ke naam se jane gayi
 As the number of diplomats of the coronation offices increased, they were recruited and separately appointed to look after them and take care of them
 in karmchaariyon kaa kaary rajanyik krity kaha gaya
 Gradually, the term diplomacy started being used for this business
 rajnay shabd kaa prayog vichaarkon dwaara anek arthon main kiya gaya he
 According to Herald Nicholson, it is sometimes used as a synonym for foreign policy, such as Indian diplomacy was not successful in neighboring countries
 kabhi is shabd dwaara sandhi vaarta ko ingit kiya jaataa he, jaise is samasya ko rajnay dwaara suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The diplomatic treaty also indicates the process and mechanism of negotiation
 kabhi-kabhi videsh seva kii ek shakha ko rajnay kah diya jaataa he
 Diplomacy is also considered to be the intangible quality or skill of negotiating an international treaty
 iskaa sabase dooshit prayog vah he jab ise ek kapattapurna kaary arth main liya jaataa he
 Thus, due to the use of the word diplomacy in various meanings, it creates confusion in the mind of the reader
 shaayad raajnneeti shaastra main yah shabd sabase adhik bhram utpann karne vaala he
 In this subject, Argensky has said that qualities like 'skill, cleverness and deceit' can be signs of good diplomacy, but they cannot be called characteristics that define diplomacy
 rajnay videsh niti ke samakaksh bhi nahin
 It is such a part of foreign policy that contributes actively to its creation and implementation
 ' According to Argensky- sar arnest santon ke anusaar, In this regard, Palmer and Perkins have expressed a curiosity that if there is a lack of intelligence and tact in the mutual relations of states, would diplomacy be impossible? It is clear that diplomacy is a relationship between two or more independent states, accordingly each state uses intelligence, skill and tact
 ke0em0 panikkar ke shabdon main, Quincy Wright has defined diplomacy in two ways - in the popular sense and in the special sense
 lokapriy arth main - The special point of this definition is that diplomacy in the popular sense has been considered a treaty that is based on persuasion rather than pressure
 iske vishesh arth main rajanyagnon ko rashtriya hit ke prati bhakthipurna mana gaya he
 Popular meaning of diplomacy does not apply in political science
 anterrashtriya sambandhon main rajnay keval vahi kaary karata he jahaan dabaav kii sambhaavnaayen rahati hai
 These possibilities are suppressed by diplomacy
 rajnay kaa uddeshy samjhaute karnaa he or samjhaute keval vahiin kiye jate hai jahaan kuch asahmatiyaan hon
 These disagreements should be such that negotiations can be agreed
 purna sahmati ke kshetron main rajnay apraasangik he tathaa purna asahmati ke kshetron main yah prabhaavaheen he
 According to Roberto Regella, the word diplomacy has been misused
 asal main rajnay ek aisa vyavsaay he jisamen anek kriyaayen shaamil ho jaati hai
 It is one of the few professions in the world that covers every branch of human activity in its periphery
 iskaa sambandh shakti raajnneeti aarthik shakti evam vichaardhaaraon ke sangharsh se he
 Regella considers diplomacy to be the 'art of negotiation'
 1796 main edmand bark ne rajnay kii paribhaasha dete hue likhaa tha ki rajnay anterrashtriya sambandhon kaa parichaalan athwa sanchaalan he
 George F
 Cannon states that in the technical sense diplomacy can be arranged as a link between governments
 is prakaar vibhinn vichaarkon ne rajnay kii vibhinn paribhaashayen di hai
 All these definitions are not entirely appropriate as the meaning of diplomacy changes as time and circumstances change
 anek vichaarkon ne rajnay ko keval ek vyavsaay hi nahin varan ek kala bhi mana he
 Most governments have started adopting it for the attainment and growth of their interests
 yah dhire-dhire shaanti kaa ek prabhaavshaalee saadhan banataa ja rahaa he
 Initially the states were full of unlimited powers and as a result, diplomats were considered sovereign
 unhen kaary karne kii paryaapt swatantraaa saunpi jaati thi
 Another reason for this freedom was that there was a lack of rapid means of communication at that time
 19veen shatabdi ke uttararddh main rajanyikon kii yah vyapak swatantraaa simit hone lagi
 Another feature of diplomacy at that time was also that diplomats were sent only by giving orders and instructions related to their work
 aajkal sanchaar ke tivrgami sadhano kii suvidha ke kaaran yah aavashyak nahin rahaa he
 Some people consider diplomacy to be a mysterious business
 yah sahi nahin he
 According to Hudh Gibson, "in fact, diplomacy is an illusionary business
 yah jaadu athwa rahasy se pare he
 It can be seen as a serious business like any other government function
 paamar tathaa parickens ne rajnay kii kuch visheshtaon kaa varnan kiya he
 These features will prove useful to explain the nature of diplomacy
 ye visheshtayen nimnlikhit hai :- Nicholson is not right to say that diplomatic work ceases when the war begins, as Palmer and Perkins think diplomats work to protect the country
 atah yuddh ke samay haath par haath dhar kar nahin baithte hai, balki us samay ve sainik kaaryon main sahyog dete hai
 In this way, the work of diplomats does not stop during the war, but the form of their work changes
 yuddh kaal main rajnay kaa kaary adhik bad jaataa he
 This is clear from the observation of the events of the last two World Wars
 rajnay kaa swaroop samajhane ke liye yah upyogi he ki videsh niti, anterrashtriya kanoon evam rajanyik raajnneeti se uske sambandh tathaa antar kaa adhyayan kiya jaye
 Dynasties and states of ancient India have a long tradition of diplomacy

 isamen rajnay ke siddhant bhi hai, jisamen bataaya he ki paraspar spardhi rajyon ke bich kis prakaar budhimaan raja gathjod banaae or apane shatruon ko gatirodh main daale
 At that time the messengers sent to the courts stopped for a long time

 Foreign policy and diplomacy are the wheels of politics with the help of which international politics operates

 It is impossible to think of a foreign policy that ignores national interest
 atah videsh niti kaa arth rajya ke us vyavhaar ke rup main liya jaataa he jiske madhyam se rajya apane hiton kii purti karte hai
 In the ancient era, a state can remain separate by adopting a policy of isolation in itself, it is impossible
 videsh niti kaa nirmaan bahut soch samaj kar kiya jaataa he kyonki isi ke sahi nirnay par hi rajya kaa bhavishya nirbhar karata he
 The state has to take many elements into consideration in the formulation of foreign policy
 udaahranarth, britain va japan kii videsh niti apni bhugolic sthiti se gahare rup se prabhavit rahi he
 The natural resources of the states or their strategic importance etc
 affect the foreign policy of the state
 aviksit rajya, jo vibhinn shaktiyon se sahaayta praapt karte rahete hai tathaa unheen par nirbhar rahete hai, kabhi bhi swatantra videsh niti kaa nirmaan nahin kar sakate hai
 The military power of a country makes its foreign policy enthusiastic and leads it on the wrong path
 germany, italy or japan ne sainik shakti ke kaaran hi apane padosi rajyon par hamalaa kiya or vishwa yuddh kaa aahvaan kiya
 The politics of the states and their foreign policy are created by the politicians of the country, then the ambassadors implement it

 satta kii prapti ke prayaason main rajya kabhi-kabhi apane swatantra nirnay ke adhikaar kho baithte hai
 The decisions of the foreign policy of the state decide on its strategic position and military power
 rajya jitna adhik shashakt hoga utani hi safal uskaa rajnay hoga
 According to Fredrik the Great, "shakti without diplomacy is the same as music without music
" “ sanyukt rajya america kaa rajnay uski shakti ke kaaran hi safal he
 If a state is weak, it invites other states to intervene or attack in that country
 poland ke vibhaajan, italy kaa europe kii ransthali bananaa, hitler dwaara austria tathaa chacoslovekia kaa vilay tathaa china kaa bharat par akraman, rajyon ke shaktiheen hone ke kaaran hi sambhav hua he
 After the policy makers have set their objectives, the question of achieving these objectives comes before the state and this is the effect of diplomacy
 videsh niti ke kshetra main rajya sakriy athwa niskriy ho saktaa he
 If the state is active then the state has four options, on the basis of which it works - political, economic, psychological and military
 samay or paristhitinusaar rajya iname se koi bhi ek vikalp apana saktaa he athwa iske sammilit rup kaa bhi prayog kar saktaa he
 Inactivity can prove fatal for any state in the current international situation

 The ambassador's activities are based on his country's foreign policy
 yadhyapi yah satya he ki rajdoot iske sanchaalan main swatantra nahin hote

" ” sar charlas vaxtor ke shabdon main, “niti kii sabase adhik dharanayen bhi vyarth hai yadi unako kriya rup main parivartit karne ke saadhan nahin hon

 The whole of Europe was accepted by Richelieu and the diplomacy interpreted by Calyars, which is called the old diplomacy

 Those who bitterly criticized the old diplomacy and accepted the new system, as President Wilson did, also had to revisit the old system shortly
