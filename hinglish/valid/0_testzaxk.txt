 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 kisi ghatana ke hone kii sambhaavna ko prayikta yaa sambhavyata kehete hai
 It is used extensively in the fields of statistics, mathematics, science, philosophy etc
 saadhaarant: sambhavyata kaa sambandh us ghatana se he jiske na hone kii apeksha ghatit hone ko adhik aashaa he
 In this sense it is different from Shakya
 ghatana shakya tab hoti he jab uske ghatane main virodh nahin hota
 It is neither possible nor feasible to have 'mother of the Mother'
 'swarna parvat' sambhavya nahin he, parantu shakya he
 In the scientific sense, probability is related to an event which is neither definite nor impossible
 yadi nishchit gyaan kaa pratik 'ek' mana jaae or nishchit gyaan ke abhaav kaa 'shunya', tab sambhavyata kaa sthaan inhen '0' or '1' ke madhya nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he
 There are basis of probability
 jevens ne sambhavyata ke aadhaar ko aatmagat mana he
 He considered faith to be the basis of probability
 yah mat doshayukt bataaya gaya he, kyonki sambhavyata kaa sambandh pariman se he or vishwaas ko maatra main vyakt karnaa sambhav nahin he
 It is also not appropriate to consider belief as the basis of probability because probability is calculated and this calculation is not possible with confidence
 vah isliye ki jis vastu main vishwaas hota he uskaa kabhi to anubhav nahin hota or kabhi kabhi ek anubhav par hi do vyaktiyon kaa vishwaas bhinn bhinn ho jaataa he
 Probability is related to arrival
 aagaman nirikshan or pareekshan par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to call probability purely subjective, because inspection and testing is thematic
 inhen uparyukt trutiyon ke kaaran kuch vichaarkon ne sambhavyata ko vishaygat pramanit kiya he
 Probability depends on experience
 anubhav vishaygat he
 Based on experience, we believe in the occurrence or not of an event
 yah vishwaas aatmagat he
 Hence the conclusion that the basis of probability is both experience and belief
 sambhavyata kii gananaa ganit dwaara hoti he
 There are different types of events
 at: unki sambhavyata kii gananaa kii bhi reeti bhinn bhinn hai
 To find the probability of a simple event, divide the probability of the occurrence by the entire number of the number of times the event occurred
 taash kii 52 pattiyon main is baar khinchne se kaala paan kaa badshaah nikle, isaki sambhaavna jaanane ke liye niyam he : Therefore, the probability of black king being king is 1 / 52
 saath saath nahin ghatanevaali do ghatnaon main ek ghatana ghatane kii sambhaavna kii gananaa ke liye unki alag alag sambhaavna ko jod dena padataa he
 In 52 cards of cards, there is a possibility of one slave and emperor coming out: isi prakaar do swatantra ghatnaon ke saath saath hone kii sambhaavna unki alag alag sambhaavnaaon ko aapas main guna karke nikaalte hai
 Rainbow and rain are likely to occur along with these two independent events: yahi niyam adheen ghatnaon ke saath bhi lagu he
 To find the probability of the truth of the evidence collected, we subtract the product of its impossibilities from 1
 anyaanya gavaahon dwaara bataai gai ghatana ke satya hone kii sambhaavna is prakaar nikaali ja sakati he : ek gavaahi main satya hone kii sambhaavna jab 5 / 6 he to usamen satya hone kii asambhaavna hogi
 Then the probability of being true in the second testimony is 2 / 3 when it is unlikely in donon kii alag asambhaavnaaon ke gunanfal ko 1 main se ghataane par uttar hoga - Thus, the probability of the incident stated by the witnesses to be true will be 17 / 18
 is prakaar sambhavyata kii maatra sankhya ke aadhaar par hi nikaali jaati he
 Therefore, if the number is not calculated completely, the quantity of probability cannot be determined
 sambhavyata kii gananaa ke uparaant jis nishkarsh kii prapti hoti he vah ausat ke liye hi satya hota he
 In other words, say that the probability is true for the average

 bhashavigyaan main 'akshar' yaa shabdaansh dhvaniyon kii sangathit ikai ko kehete hai
 Any word can be spoken by breaking it into fractions and syllables are the parts of the word that cannot be made any shorter, otherwise the sounds of the word are changed
 udhaahrantah 'achaanak' shabd ke teen shabdaansh hai - 'a', 'chaa' or 'nak'
 If 'a-cha-nak' is spoken intermittently, the three syllables of the word can be seen fragmentarily but the pronunciation of the word seems to be correct
 agar 'nak' ko aage todaa jaae to shabd kii dhvaniyaan galat ho jaatin hai - 'a-chaa-na-k'
 is shabd ko 'a-chaan-k' bhi nahin bolaa jaataa kyonki is se bhi uccharan galat ho jaataa he
 Some short words have the same syllable, such as 'in', 'ear', 'hand', 'walk' and 'ja'
 Some words have two syllables, such as 'walker', food, handkerchief and vegetable
 kuch main teen yaa us se bhi adhik shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'mahatvapurn' or 'antarrashtriya' 
 The word Akshar means - 'which cannot happen, nor can be destroyed'
 iskaa prayog pehle 'vaani' yaa 'vaak' ke liye evam shabdaansh ke liye hota tha
 The letter continued to be used for 'varna' as well
 yahi kaaran he ki lipi sanketon dwaara vyakt varnon ke liye bhi aaj 'akshar' shabd kaa prayog saamaanya jan karte hai
 Scientific study of the language has given the letter the meaning of English 'syllable', in which vowels, vowels and consonants, including vowels or consonant sounds with reminders, are considered
 ek hi aghat yaa bal main boli jane vaali dhwani yaa dhwani samudaay kii ikai ko akshar kaha jaataa he
 The basis of unit separation is the vowel or vowel consonant
 vyanjan dhwani kisi uccharan main swar kaa purv yaa par ang banakar hi aati he
 Astu, the vowel in the letter is the spine
 akshar se swar ko na to pruthak hi kiya ja saktaa he or na bina swar yaa swararat vyanjan ke akshar kaa nirmaan hi sambhav he
 If the consonant is like a pearl in pronunciation, the vowel is like a thread
 yadi swar shashakt samraat he to vyanjan ashakt raja
 It is on this basis that a letter is often considered synonymous with vowels, but it is not so, yet vowels have great importance in letter formation
 katipay bhashaaon main vyanjan dhvaniyaan bhi akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 In English, consonant sounds like Na, Su and l are also pronounced vowrat and help in syllable formation like vowel sounds
 angreji silabal ke liye hindi main akshar shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma has used the word 'swarik' for syllable
 
 Since the word alphabet has been used for many meanings in the history of language and grammar, its use in the meaning of syllable leads to the possibility of confusion
 shabd ke uccharan main jis dhwani par shikharata yaa ucchata hoti he vahi akshar yaa silabal hota he, jaise haath main aa dhwani par
 This word has a letter
 'akalpit' shabd main teen akshar hai - a, kal, pit ; aazaadee main teen - aa ja di; arthath shabd main jahaan jahaan swar ke uccharan kii pruthakta pai jaae vahaan-vahaan akshar kii pruthakta hoti he
 When considered from the point of view of sound production, the unit of pleural circulation is called syllable or vocal, which has the same sound
 sharir rachana kii drushti se akshar yaa swarik ko phuffus spandan bhi kah sakate hai, jiskaa uccharan dhwani tantra main avarodhan hota he
 When the component is highest in the movement letter at the time of pronunciation of the sound block or the lowest sound group, then that sound is alphabetic
 swar dhvaniyaan bahudhaa aksharvat uccharit hoti he evam vyanjan dhvaniyaan kvachit
 The absolutely separate unit of lexical pronunciation is called a letter, as kisi shabd main aksharon kii sankhya is baat par katai nirbhar nahin karti ki usamen kitni dhvaniyaan hai, balki is baat par ki shabd kaa uccharan kitne aghat yaa jatke main hota he arthath shabd main kitni avyavhit dhwani ikaiyaan hai
 In addition to the head sound used in the letter, the remaining sounds are called ‘aksharang’ or ‘gahvar sound’
 udhaaharan ke liye 'chaar' main ek akshar he jisamen aa sheersh dhwani tathaa c evam r gahvar dhvaniyaan hai
 In any syllable there is a 'syllabus center', which is always the vowel character and other characters are found around it which can be consonants and also vowels
 The syllable center of the syllable 'ear' is the vowel of 'aa', from which the letters 'a' and 'n' come later

 Chlorophyll, contains 2
6% magnesium
 isamen loha yaa phosphorus nahin hota
 Its hydrolysis provides methyl alcohol and phytol alcohol and 8 pyrol nuclei

 Hemoglobin is an essential component of the blood of humans and other animals
 inamen kuch antar bhi he
 Chlorophyll is a waxy substance
 haemoglobin hime or globin kaa aanvik yogic he
 Chlorophyll is actually an ester type compound, in which methyl and phytol alcohols are combined
 chlorophyl ke jalavishleshan se methil or fetol alcohalon ke saath-saath carboxylik amlon ke lavan praapt hote hai, jinhen chlorophylin kehete hai
 Chlorophylline still contains magnesium, due to which its color is green
 yadi chlorophyl kaa jal vishleshan chlorophillage naamak anzime main kiya jaay, to jo utpaada praapt hota he use chlorophylide kehete hai
 Chlorophyllide is a microcrystalline substance, while chlorophyll is acrystically
 amlon ke upachaar se magnesium nikal jaataa he or ab jo utpaada praapt hota he use porafirin kehete hai
 Porphyrin has both acid and alkali properties
 vibhinn avasthaaon main vibhinn abhikarmakon ke upachaar se chlorophyl se anek utpaada praapt hue hai, jinase pataa lagata he ki chlorophyl main pyrol cendrak rahete hai
 Based on the composition of these products, Chlorophyll gave a chemical formula by Fisher in 1939

 asahyog andolan ke baad namak satyagrah, phir vyaktigat satyagrah or ant main 1942 kaa aitihaasik bharat chodo andolan
 In this way, Navinji spent nine years of his life in prison in total six prison visits

 His important poems are Kumkum, Rashmirekha, Apalak, Quasi, Urmila, Vinoba Stavana, Pranaparan and Hum Poisonous Birth
 pehali jailyatra ke dauraan urmila kii shuruuaat kii
 The inspiration of Acharya Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi can be clearly seen in the propulsion of the Urmila epic

 Apart from this, most of his poems are also written in the prison room
 jail se baahar naveenji kavy kii drushti se kuch vishesh nahin likh paae
 The innumerable foreheads and essays that Naveen wrote in his life outside of prison, from the title of despair in the Simla Agreement, in the help of Muslim brothers, the concern of your fast, the 'chatter of the same bag' etc

 The International Organization for Standardization, often called the ISO, is an international standards-making body composed of representatives of standards organizations of various nations
 isaki sthapana 23 farvari, 1947 ko hui thi, vishwavyaapee audyogic evam vanijyik maanakon ko ghoshit karne hetu
 Its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland
 yadhyapi ISO swayan ko ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kahata he, isaki maanak sthapit karne kii kshamta, jo ki praay vidhi ban jate hai, yaa to samjhauton ke dwaara, yaa phir rashtriya maan; yah isko gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon se adhik shaktishaalee banaata he
 In practice, it is working like a faculty or short-term organization, which has strong links with governments
 
 The logo or symbol of this organization is American English and French in two official languages
 isamen ISO akshar bhi sammilit hai, jinase yah praayah janaa jaataa he, jo ki isaki sankshipti he
 Rather this abbreviation is derived from the Greek / Greek word ἴσος, which means equal
 yah maanate hue ki sanghathan kaa bhinn bhashaaon main bhinn sankshipti banegi, yah tay kiya ki ek sarvyaapee sarvamaanya naam ISO hi chalaaya jaae
 This in itself proves the purpose of this organization
 ISO ke mukhya utpaada hai anterrashtriya maanak
 Only published by ISO are: Technical Reports, Technical Specialization, Publicly Available Specialties, Technical Corrigendum, and and Guide
 anterrashtriya maanak kaa roopakar hota he ISO xxrep 5 n sheershak, jahaan xxrep 5 n he maanak sankhya, xxrep 4 y he prakaashan kaa varsh, evam sheershak bataata he vishay
 yadi maanak sanyukt takneekee samiti JTC1 ke kaary kaa parinaam he, to IEC bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 ASTM is also incorporated into standards developed in collaboration with ASTM International
 dinaak evam IS kaa prayog apurna yaa aprakashit maanakon ke liye aprayogneey he, evam kuch paristhitiyon main prakashit kaary kaa sheershak bhi chhona ja saktaa he
 a technical report is issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has generally collected data of a different type from the published international standard, such as references or interpretations
 inaki namakaran pratha maanakon kii bhaanti hi he, keval TR lagaaya jaataa he IS ke sthaan par, report ke naam se pehle
 For example takneekee vishesheekaran ko tab rachit kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki "sambandhit vishay abhi bhi vikaas kii sthiti main hi he, yaa kisi anya karanvash bhavishya main kisi anterrashtriya maanak ko prakashit karne kii sahmati kii sambhaavna hoti he" 
 Publicly available specialties can be an "intermediate specialization that has been published prior to the development of the full international standard", or, a 'bicameral' publication in the IEC, published in collaboration with an external organization
 " Naming is done like a technical report
 udhaahrantah ISO sometimes also issues technical / technical corrigendum
 ye vartmaan maanakon ke sanshodhan hote hai, jo ki kshudra takneekee / paribhaashik trutiyon, prayogneeyata sudhaar yaa simit tareeke se prayojyata badhaane hetu kiye jate hai
 Often these are issued with the hope that the affected standard will be either quoted or withdrawn until their next scheduling overview
 ISO path-pradarshak ardh-maanak hote hai, anterrashtriya maanakeekaran se sambandhit vishyon ko liye hue
 These are named in the "ISO Guide N: xxrep 4 y : title", eg ISO pralekh prakashnadhikaar surakshit hote hai, evam ISO adhiktar kii pratiyon kaa mulya letaa he
 However, most of the values are taken only in electronic form

 Some standards are provided free of charge by ISO and its official United States Representative and International Electrotechnical Commission
 ISO ke 157 rashtriya sadsy hai, out of the 195 total countries in the world
 ISO has three membership categories: bhagidaar sadsy "P" yaa pi sadsy kehalaate hai, jabaki anupaalan karne vaale "O" yaa o sadsy kehalaate hai
 The fact that many iso-created standards are universal, ubiquitous; On many occasions, the general use of "ISO" has been inspired to describe a product that conforms to the standards
 iske kai udhaaharan hai: To deal with the consequences of abundant coverage in the areas of standardization, and the tasks related to information technology; a Joint Technical Committee constituted from ISO & IEC or International Electrotechnical Commission known as ISO / IEC JTC1
 yah asi pratham samiti he, evam ajtak ek hi he
 Its official order is to develop, maintain, promote IT standards for business and user requirements in worldwide markets
 vartmaan main 18 up-samitiyaan hai :- Membership of ISO / IEC JTC1 is restricted to the same extent as that of its parent organizations
 ek sadsy yaa to bhagidaar yaa prekshak ho saktaa he
 The only difference between the proposed standards and other products is the ability to vote
 kisi sadsy sanstha ke liye kisi yaa prayek up-samiti par str / raay banaae rakhane kii, koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Occasionally, sub-committees may be formed, or even dissolved, to cope with new situations if their area of work is no longer in force
 ISO / TS jaise, antarrashtriya kaaryshaala samjhauta International Workshop Agreement bhi ISO kaa ek or shastraagaar he, jo ki un kshetron main, jahaan takneekee sanrachana evam nipunata abhi nahin pahaunchi he; vahaan maanakeekaran kii aavashyaktaaon par twarit pratikriya uplabdh karaata he
 This utility caters to worldwide technological urgency
 gandki anchal angrezi: Gandaki Zone sune sahaayta·soochna nepal ke madhya pashchimi bhaag main sthit he
 In Nepal, the province has been called a zone

 There is a very beautiful pokhara upatya in this zone

 a calligraphy is a special type of clock which is also used as a 'stop watch'
 kintu multah kalalikh aisa yantra tha jisamen samay ko kaagaj yaa feete par 'likhane' kii vyavastha thi
 Early chronographers were the only instruments who actually 'wrote'
 aadhunik kronograph ek vishesh prakaar kii ghadi he jo ek 'stopwach' jaise kaam main lee ja sakati he
 The soot used in astrology works mostly on the following principle: Paper is wrapped on a cylindrical drum
 dhol ko samgati se keval itane veg se ghumaya jaataa he ki vah prati minute ek yaa do puure chakkar lagaae
 a stylus rests on this paper in such a way that it moves the line on the paper as the drum rotates
 lekhnee bhi mand samgati se pench dwaara ek ore hatati jaati he
 Therefore, the line drawn on the paper is spiral
 kalam ek vidyut chumbak se sambhddha rahati he
 In this electromagnet, an electric current is kept momentarily per second by the clock, which causes the stylus to pull one side for one second per second
 isliye kaagaj par khinchi rekha main prayek second kaa chihn ban jaataa he
 When pressing a button on the occurrence of a particular event, it removes the stylus and also marks the time of that event
 chihnon ke bich kii duuri naapane se ghatana ke samay kaa pataa second ke sauven bhaag tak chal saktaa he
 Sometimes paper boards use paper tape reels instead of cylindrical drums
 feete ko samgati se lekhnee ke neeche se le jate hai
 The feature in this is that the device is small, but the inconvenience is that it is difficult to keep the accounts of the ribbon on time and use later
 kabhi-kabhi ek ke sthaan par do lekhaniyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, ek second ankit karne ke liye or duusari ghatana kaa samay
 The drawback of this is that the removal of the edges of each stylus may take a different time and may result in a slight error in the time spent
 yadi bhinn-bhinn yantron dwaara praapt ghatnaon kaa samay gyaat karnaa he to do se adhik lekhaniyon kaa bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The electromagnet of each stylus is driven by a different device
 baad main aise bhi kalalikh banaaye gayi jinamein minute, second or second ke shatansh ke chihn ek ghoomte hue chakra dwaara, jisamen chaape ke tip lage rahete hai, kaagaj par chhap die jate hai
 The printing cycle rotates at the same velocity by a controller, and this velocity is controlled by the clock
 ghatana ke samay ko ankit karne ke liye choti hathaudi rahati he jo batan dabaane par shighrata se kaagaj par chot markar hat jaati he
 With this, the number, which is in front of the hammer at that moment, is printed on the paper
 is prakaar ghatana kaa samay bina kisi naap ke gyaat ho jaataa he, parantu lekhnee yaa hathaudi ke chihnon ko ankit karne main kuch samay lagata he or naap main kuch truti kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Therefore, for very subtle measurements, such timelines have been created in which the events are recorded by electrocution
 bandook yaa top kii goli kaa veg naapane ke liye do parde rakhe jate hai
 By measuring the time of bullet from one screen to another, the speed of the bullet can be known by the following formula: pardon ke bich kii duuri naapane main koi kathinaayee nahin padati, parantu samay kii naap badi sookshmata se honi chahie
 If the speed is 2,000 feet per second, it takes a total of 1 / 20 seconds for the bullet to cross 100 feet
 bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke pardon kaa upyog hota he
 a type of curtain is made by separating between two electrical conductors
 jab goli parde ko chhedati he to donon chaalak pardo se goli dwaara sampark ho jaataa he or us kshan vidyutsanketch chal padataa he
 These curtains can be used again and again, but they have the inconvenience that entering the curtain makes a difference in the speed of the bullet
 duusare prakaar ke pardo main vidyucchumbakeey preran kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Electric wire circles are installed in place of curtains
 goli saadhaaran goli na hokar chumbakit goli hoti he
 When this bullet passes through the circle of wire, an electric current is generated in the wire, which gives the signal
 prakaash-vaidyut pardo kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Photographs are shot through a telephoto lens onto a light electrical cell
 jab lens ke saamne se goli jaati rahati he to prakaash ke kam ho jane se cell main vidyuddhara bhi kam ho jaati he
 And also electric current
 ekaek badhati hui is vidyut dhara se sanket bheja ja saktaa he
 Paper wrapped drum can also be used to measure the velocity of the bullet
 saadhanrat: dhol prati second 60 chakkar lagata he
 When the bullet crosses the curtain, the spooling generated by the signal at that time marks the paper
 ek duusare prakaar ke kalalikh main dhol par saadhaaran kaagaj na laga kar photography kaa kaagaj lagaate hai
 The drum rotates in a dark box and at the same time gradually one edge is removed
 dolanlekhi dharamapi ke darpan se paravartit prakashakiran ek chhidr main se jaakar photo ke kaagaj par rekha khinchati jaati he
 When the signal comes from the curtain, the mirror of the photometer rotates and the reflected light does not remain in line with the hole
 prakaash na pahunchne se rekha us sthaan par kati si jaan padati he
 a mark is made on this line every 1 / 1000 second by a second photometer; This helps in measuring
 duusare mahayuddh main samay naapane ke liye radio valvo ke paripathon kaa bhi prayog hua
 These instruments have three parts
 pehle bhaag main ek dolak hota he jisase prati 1 / 1,00,000wein second par vidyut spandan bheja jaataa he
 In the second part, there is an arrangement to operate and shut down the device
 pehle parde se sanket aane par yantra apane aap chalane lagata he or duusare parde se sanket aane par swat: band ho jaataa he
 In the third part there is an arrangement to count the electrospheres
 inaki ginati se pataa chal jaataa he ki donon sanketon ke bich kitna samay beetaa
 Phitsanulok Ayutthaya Lopburi Ayutthaya Minority: Hinduism, Roman Catholic, Shia Islam, Sunni Islam Ayudhya or Ayuthia was the capital of Syam from 1350 AD to 1967 AD
 vah minaam cho fia tathaa loyabari nadiyon ke sangam par ek dweep main bainkak se 42 mile kii duuri par sthit he

 It is counted in the lesser types of poetry
 "dhvanyalok" main jise "chitrakavy" kaha he, vahi "kavyprakash" kaa avarakavy he
 In the absence of a satirical satirical word, from the lexicon of the semantic, etc
, in which the word miraculous or semantic picture is created, it is called "pictograph"
 isamen ras-bhavadi kavy ke marmasparshi tatwon ke na rahane se anubhuti kii gaharaai kaa abhaav rahata he; anupras, yamak yaa upama, roopak aadi kii kori shabdaarth krida hi mukhya ho uthati he
 Playing with words or meaning is mostly intended here
 inhi aadhaaron par is kavy vidha ke do bhed maane gaye hai- shabdachitr or arthchitr
 Where alliterative miracles are represented by alliteration, Yamakadi lexicographies or Ojaprasadadi attributive characters, it is called Vyapachitra and where Upma-jyotaksadi is intended to be a semantic euphemism with metaphorical semantics, it is called Arthashastra
 inamen bhavpurn evam ramaniarth kii avhelnaa karte hue kridavriti par hi bal diya jaataa he
 Chitrasarjan is also done through Varnadambar - like a poem in Hindi called "amritadhvani"
 dandi ne swar-sthaan-varna-niyam-krit vaichitryamulak kuch shabdalankaron kii charchaa karte hue do teen chaar vyanjan, swar aadi vaale chitrakavyabhed kaa bhi nirdesh diya he
 Going beyond this, there is a specific type of Shabdkrida which is often called Chitrabandhakavya and in which there are bound, well-crafted verses found in the sketches of Khadga, Padma, Hull etc
 hridayasparshita se bahut rahit hone se inhen kavy nahin padya maatr kahana chahie
 "rudrat" etc
 has called it a distinction of the word "chitralankar"
 "arthchitr" main mukhyat: uhamulak, kshtakalpanashrith, kreedaparak evam asahaj arthvaichitrya maatr kii udbhaavna kii jaati he
 Therefore, they are also the creators of awe-inspiring curiosity rather than a communicative heart
 "prahelika" or "dusht prahelika" ke bhed bhi chitrakavy hi hai
 These are also often used to garner curiosity with the word play
 taatpary yah ki chitrakavy kii prerana kavi ke bhavakul antstal se nahin varan kridapurna evam vaichitryasuchak kutuhalavritti se milti he
 Therefore, there is no sign of spontaneous luxury from the sense of the poet's heart
 bandha - chitrakavy main chand kii aisi rachana jisaki kuch vishisht niyamon ke anusaar uski panktiyon ke akshar baitaane se kisi vishesh prakaar kii akruti yaa chitra ban jaay
 Such as Ashwabandha, Kharagbandha, chhatra-bandha etc

 In it, brackets are filled with letters of the steps or lines of the poem

 anumaan, darshan or tarkshastra kaa paribhaashik shabd he
 Name of the means of enlightenment in Indian philosophy is evidence
 anumaan bhi ek pramaan hai
 Except for Charvak philosophy, almost all philosophies consider inference as a means of enlightenment
 anumaan ke dwaara jo gyaan praapt hota hai uskaa naam anumiti hai
 The knowledge of the existence of an object which is not being realized by the direct, based on the direct knowledge of such an object, which is the name of the process of accessing this knowledge, indicating the existence of that indirect object
 is prakriya kaa saralatam udhaaharan is prakaar he-kisi parvat ke us paar dhuaan uthta hua dekhakar vahaan par aag ke astitv kaa gyaan anumiti he or yah gyaan jis prakriya se utpann hota he uskaa naam anumaan he
 Here there is no matter of direct, only direct knowledge of smoke
 par purvakaal main anek baar kai sthanon par aag or dhuen ke saath-saath pratyaksh gyaan hone se man main yah dharna ban gai he ki jahaan-jahaan dhuaan hota he vahiin-vahiin aag bhi hoti he
 Now when we only experience the smoke directly and we remember that wherever there is smoke, there is fire, then we think that now we will see fire where there is smoke: hence the mountain On the other side, where we are getting direct knowledge of smoke at this time, fire will definitely be present
 is prakaar kii prakriya ke mukhya angon ke paribhaashik shabd ye hai: The meaning of inference in Western logic is somewhat different and broader than the meaning used in Indian logic
 vahaan par kisi ek vaakya athwa ek se adhik vaakyon kii satyata ko maanakar uske aadhaar par kya-kya vaakya satya ho sakate hai, isko nishchit karne kii prakriya kaa naam anumaan he or vishesh paristhitiyon ke anubhav ke aadhaar par saamaanya vyaptiyon kaa nirmaan bhi anumaan hi he
 There are two types of guesses - selfishness and altruism
 swaarth anumaan apni vah maansik prakriya he jisamen baar-baar ke pratyaksh anubhav ke aadhaar par apane man main vyapti kaa nishchay ho gaya ho or phir kabhi pakshadharmata gyaan ke aadhaar par apane man main saadhy ke astitv kii anumiti kaa udai ho gaya he jaisaa ki uu par parvat par agni ke anumiti gyaan main dikhalaayaa gaya he
 This entire process is of one's own mind to understand oneself
 kintu jab hamako kisi duusare vyakti ko paksh main saadhy ke astitv kaa ni:shank nishchay karana ho to ham apane manogat ko paanch angon main, jinako avyav kehete hai, prakat karte hai
 Those five components are: pratigya - arthath jo baat siddh kerani ha uskaa kathan
 Example: There is fire across the mountain
 hetu - kyon aisa anumaan kiya jaataa hai, iskaa kaaran arthath paksh main ling kii upasthiti kaa gyaan karana
 Example: because there is smoke
 udhaaharan - sapaksh or vipaksh drushtaanton dwaara vyapti kaa kathan karnaa, udaahraan : jahaan-jahaan dhuaan hota hai, vahaan-vahaan aag hoti hai, jaise chuulhe main or jaha-jahaan aag nahin hoti, vahaan-vahaan dhuaan bhi nahin hota, jaise talab main
 Upanayya - to tell that there is such a gender present in the side which indicates the existence of the practicable
 udhaaharan : yahan bhi dhuaan maujuud he
 Incorporation - It is proved that there is fire across the mountain
 bharat main yah pararth anumaan darshanik or anya sabhi prakaar ke vaad-vivaadon or shastrarthon main kaam aata he
 It was also prevalent in the country of Greece and Euclid used it well in writing geometry
 arestu ko bhi iskaa gyaan tha
 The philosophers of India and Aristotle also considered only three in place of five elements, because the first and fifth elements are usually the same
 upanay to maansik kriya he jo vyapti or pakshadharmata ke saath saamne hone par man main apane aap udai ho jaati hai
 If the front is not very retarded, but is intelligent, then the statement of these two elements is needed only for the vow and for
 isliye vedant or navy nyaay ke granthon main keval do hi avyavon kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 Arrival and incorporation are both parts of the Indian estimate
 saamaanya vyapti ke aadhaar par vishesh paristhiti main saadhy ke astitv kaa gyaan nigaman he or vishesh paristhitiyon ke pratyaksh anubhav aadhaar par vyapti kii sthapana aagaman he
 The former process is called deduction and the north process is induction in western countries
 arestu aadi paashchaatya tarkshastriyon ne nigaman par bahut vichaar kiya or mil aadi aadhunik tarkshastriyon ne aagaman kaa vishesh manan kiya
 The establishment in India was based on direct knowledge of three or any one of the three types
 ve ye hai : Kevalavaya, when the association of gender and the practicable is only experienced, when their co-absence cannot be seen
 keval vyatirek jab saadhy or ling or ling kaa sah-abhaav hi anubhav main aata he, saahchary nahin
 Exploratory - When both coexistence and coexistence of gender and practicable come into play

 aapane dekha ki chaay banane ke liye spasht evam ek nishcchit kram main nirdesh diye gaye
 This instruction is sufficient to make tea even from someone who has never made tea
 isi prakaar sanganak se koi kaary karaane ke liye use spasht evam nishchit kram main nirdesh diye jate hai;or yahi prakriya sanganak krmanudesan he
 The computer only understands machine language
 vibhinn krmanudesan bhashaa main likhe gaye program main nirdesho ko Assembler, compiler athwa Interpreter kii sahaayta se masini bhashaa main parivartit karke sanganak ke micoprocesar main bheja jaataa he
 Only then the computer follows these instructions and produces suitable results
 masini bhashaa maatr byanary anko arthath 0 se 1 ke samooho se bani hoti he jise sanganak kaa micoprocesar sidhe samaj saktaa he
 When we give any instructions to the computer through any input, the computer can automatically convert these instructions into ASCII Code
 nirdesh dene ke liye hame saamanyat: aksharo, sankhyao evam sanketo ke "kies" ko kii-board par dabaanaa hota he or sanganak swatah hi inhe apni bhashaa main badal letaa he
 example-type in machine language -TY PE sanganak ko nirdesh program tareeke se, atyant spasht bhashaa main evam vistaar se dena atyant aavashyak hota he
 a program has to be made and given to the computer to do the work
 diya gaya program jitna spasht, vistrut or sateek hoga, sanganak utane hi sucharu rup se kaary karegaa, utani hi kam galtiyaa karegaa or utane hi sahi uttar degaa
 If the program is unclear and does not have the proper details and clear instructions, then it is possible that the computer continues to calculate without extracting the result or the result obtained from it is unclear and meaningless
 atah program atyant saavdhaanee or ekagrachit hokar taiyaar karnaa chaiye
 The overall functionality of the computer depends on the capacity of the person making the program
 sanganak me apni koi budhdi nahin hoti
 It is a brainless and very obedient machine
 yadi use koi nirdesh nahin diya jaataa athwa aspasht nirdesh diya jaataa he tab bhi vah koi aapatti nahin karata or die gaye nirdeshaanusaar hi kaary karata he
 Therefore, extreme caution is required while making the program
 sanganak par program banaate samay nimna batoo ko dhyaan main rakhana aavadhyak he:- It is advisable to present the instructions in the program as a flow table
 isame yah spasht hona chaiye ki sanganak ko kab or kya karnaa he evam use vibhinn kriyaaye kis rup main kerani he
 The program is shown in the form of a flow diagram from top to bottom and where logic etc
 has to be done, it is divided into two parts
 program main nirdesho ko sanganak kii samaj main aane vaali bhashaa main likhnaa aavashyak hota he; taaki sanganak pradutt nirdesho ko samaj sake or unke anusaar kaary karke vaanchit parinaam prastut kar sake
 Once the program is written in the computer language, it is put in the memory of the computer ie on the input devices such as floppy, magnetic lace, perforated card etc
 saath hi yah samasya ko hal karne ke liye aavashyak data bhi sanganak kii input unit ko pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Now the computer works according to that program and displays the analysis of the input data to produce the appropriate result
 yadi program main praapt parinamo ko monitor screen par pradarshit karne athwa flopy, harddisk yaa chumbakeey feete par ankit karne ke nirdesh diye gaye hai tab sanganak praapt parinamo ko vahiin ankit kar detaa he
