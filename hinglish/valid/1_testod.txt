 Like other scientific disciplines, it is also a synthesis of many types of knowledge, opinions and systems, which are used in the field of classification
 jeevigyaan sambandhi kisi prakaar ke vishleshan kaa pratham sopan he suvyavasthit dhang se uskaa vargeekaran; at: padap, yaa jantu ke adhyayan kaa pehla kadam he uskaa namakaran, vargeekaran or tab varnan
 Nowadays more than four lakh species of plants are known
 ye linius ke samay se sathguni adhik hai
 About 4,750 new castes are described every year 
 samanarthak or upjatiyon ko milakar keval fenrogams or kriptogams naamak padap samoohon main 1763 se 1942 i

 The species of animals described are more than the plant species in the count
 upjatiyon ko milakar 20 lakh se adhik jantujatiyon ke naam gyaat hai or prati varsh lagbhag 10,000 nai jatiyon kaa varnan hota he
 The history of taxonomy is as old as human history
 samaj boojh hote hi manushya ne aas paas ke jantuon or paudhon ko pahchaanana tathaa unako naam dena prarambh kiya
 Many ancient scholars of Greece, notably Hippocrates and Democritus, have ranked animals in their studies
 spasht rup se arestu ne apane samay ke gyaan kaa upyukt sankalan kiya he
 The beginning of classification appears in the mention of Aristotle
 inkaa mat he ki jantu apane rahan sahan ke dhang, swabhaav or shaareerik aakaar ke aadhaar par pruthak kiye ja sakate hai
 He mentions animal groups such as birds, fish, whale, insects, and has also used the words Coleoptera and Diptera for small groups

 John Ray was the first person in the field of genealogical experts to distinguish between caste and lineage, and was the first among ancient scientists to have a higher natural classification
 inkaa prabhaav sweden ke rahanevaale mahaan prakrutivaadee karl liniyas par padaa

 In the eighteenth century, the ideas of evolutionism had an impact on taxonomy
 unnisvin shatabdi ke madhya main yah prabhaav apane shikhar par pahunch gaya
 At the same time, classification experts became very interested in animals from distant places
 ve dur deshon ke jaanwaron ke vishay main jaankaree karnaa chaahate the or parichit jaanwaron se unka sambandh karnaa chaahate the
 Hence, there were long voyages at this time
 dur dur ke jaanwaron kaa adhyayan kiya gaya or unke vansh tathaa kutumb aadi kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 One such voyage took place on a ship called Bigley which also included a naturalist named Charles Darwin
 is kaal main vargeekaran vigyaan main badi pragati kii gai or vargeekaran main anek nai jatiyaan, vansh or kutumb jode gaye
 Classification made in the twentieth century is characteristic of science
 haxli ke vicharanusaar aadhunik vargeekaran vigyaan bhugol, paristhitiki, koshiki or anuvanshiki aadi kaa sanshleshan he
 In earlier times, the basis of classification science was "types", which were presented with the help of natural traits
 aadhunik vargeekaran vigyaan main jatiyon kaa varnan purnataya akritik lakshanon par aadhaarit nahin he, jaivik he, jisaki vajah se bhugolic, paristhitik, jananeey tathaa kuch anya lakshanon par bhi dhyaan diya jaataa he
 Formal concept broadens the stability of ranges, increases the differences between each other and reduces variability
 iske vipareet he jansankhya sankalpana, jiske anusaar spishiz parivartansheel jansankhya se bani he or sthir nahin he
 Defining specific groups or categories by reverse means a definite method of classification
 linius ne aisi paanch shreniyan banaai thim : Each category consists of one or more lower level groups and they form the lower category
 isi tarah prayek kramik shrenee ek athwa ek se adhik unchi shrenee se sambandhit hoti he
 These ranges form a comprehensive system by decreasing natural discernment
 gyaan ke vikaas ke saath saath in shreniyon kii sankhya badhati gai
 Between the world and the class, between the union and the gana and the dynasty, categories called kutumb were added
 linius ke vicharanusaar prajati ek vaikalpik shrenee he, jiske antargat bhugolic athwa vyaktigat vibhinnata aati he
 In this way, the following seven categories are now: vargeekaran kii or adhik parishuddh vyakhya ke liye in shreniyon ko bhi vibhajit kar anya shreniyan banaai gai hai
 Mostly these categories are named by adding prefixes or sub prefixes before the original name
 udaahranarth, adhigan or upagan aadi
 Many names were proposed for higher categories, but they are not in common use
 keval aadim jati kaa kutumb or vansh ke bich prayog kiya jaataa he
 Some authors, such as Simpson, have used the name cohort between gana and class
 is tarah saadhaaran taur se kaam laai janevaali shreniyon kii sankhya is samay nimnlikhit he : At present, the 'international Nomenclature Code' defines seven categories of classification of organisms

 However, it has not yet been approved in the codes
 saat mukhya shreniyon ke bich main bhi shreniyan banaai ja sakati hai jiske liye 'adhi-', 'up-' yaa 'inphra-' upsargon kaa prayog karnaa chaiye
 Apart from this, there is a slight difference in the categories of classification of zoology and botany)

 The Bible is the cornerstone of Christianity and the holiest scripture of Christians
 iske do bhaag hai : purvavidhan or navvidhan 
 The first half of the Bible is also the scripture of the Old Testament Jews
 bible ishwarprerit he kintu use apaurushey nahin kaha ja saktaa
 God has inspired various writers of the Bible in such a way that they can be called their own creations even though they are Godsized
 ishwar ne bolkar unase bible nahin likhavai
 He certainly tended to write with the inspiration of God, but he has written it according to the characteristics of his culture, style and ideology
 at: bible ishwariya prerana tathaa maanviya parishram donon kaa sammilit parinaam he
 The history and account of what God did for mankind and the Jews and the reaction of man to it is the theme of the Bible
 bible gudh darshanik satyon kaa sankalan nahin he balki isamen dikhalaayaa gaya he ki ishwar ne maanav jati kii mukti kaa kya prabandh kiya he
 In fact, the Bible is a history of the implementation of divine liberation that began in the Old Testament and was edited by Jesus in the New Testament
 at: bible ke donon bhaagon main ghanishtha sambandh he
 The events of the life of Jesus are laid out by the events of the Old Testament
 new testament main dikhalaayaa gaya he ki muktividhan kis prakaar isa ke vyaktitv, chamatkaaron, shiksha, maran tathaa punarutthan dwaara sampann hua he; kis prakaar isa ne carch kii sthapana kii or is carch ne apane praarambhik vikaas main isa ke jivan kii ghatnaon ko kis drushti se dekha he ki unamem se kya nishkarsh nikaala he
 Incidentally, things related to cosmic knowledge have also come up in the Bible; There is a full impression of the immediate assumptions on them because the Bible hardly wants to give any direction about them
 maanav jati ke itihaas kii ishwariya vyakhya prastut karnaa or dharm evam mukti ko samajhnaa, yahi bible kaa pradhan uddeshy he, bible kii tatsambandhi shiksha main koi bhranti nahin ho sakati
 There is also a description of the sin of humans at many places
 aisa aacharan anukaraniya adarsh ke rup main nahin prastut hua he kintu uske dwaara spasht ho jaataa he ki manushya kitne kalushit hai or unako ishwar kii mukti kii kitni aavashyaktaa he

 Its native language was some Aramaic and mostly colloquial Ancient Greek
 isamen khaas taur par chaar shubhasandesh hai jo isa kii jeevani kaa unke chaar shishyon ke naam se kisi or ke dwaara varnan he : matti, luka, yuhanna or marakus
 The religion book of Judaism is also the Bible, but it contains only the Old Testament
 bible kul milakar 66 granthon kaa sankalan he - purvavidhan main 39 tathaa navvidhan main 27 granth hai

 The last book is called Apocalypse

 The remaining 21 texts of the New Testament are Shiksha-pradhan, namely 14 letters of Sant Pal, two letters of Santpeeter, three letters of the saint Yohan, the gospel writer, one letter by Saint Yakub and one by Saint Jude
 sant paal ke patr yaa to kisi sthanvishesh ke nivaasiyon ke liye likhe gaye hai yaa kisi vyaktivishesh ko 
 There is no doubt about the authenticity of the letters of the Hebrews, which are included in the Bible, but despite being influenced by the thoughts of Sant Pal, their author will be someone else

 Being a masterpiece of man, the Bible should be studied like other cosmic literature; Therefore isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki bible ke vyaakhyaata ke liye bible main ullikhit deshon kii vistrut jaankaree ke atirikt bhashavigyaan, itihaas, bhugol, puraatatv, dharmon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan jaisi anek sahaayak vidhaayen atyant aavashyak hai

 Maybe it is a contingency
 mulat: ek damit janata ke dharm ke rup main isiyat anek pareekshanon ke pashchaat apane vijiton kaa dharm bani
 The ancient religion of the Bible is spiritually combined with the Quran and Islam and is associated with a chosen elite
 musa athwa isa, abraham yaa suleman muslimon main shraddhey naam hai
 The Bible is different from this
 yah kai granthon kaa nichod he
 This is the entire story of the Jewish people and perhaps the most varied Jewish experiences among the ancient people
 yah aisi jati thi jo khoonkhaar kabeelon se ghiri thi or jo swayan bhi kam khoonkhaar na thi
 Sometimes they were demeaned, conquered and enslaved
 is jati ne kabhi apane shatruon ko vijit kiya tathaa unki shakti aajamaai, phir bhoomisaat kar daalaa 
 It is the aspiration and inspiration and triumph and defeat of one such public who is described in the Bible with amazing vivacity
 usne hamen apane abraham or musa jaise mahaan netaaon, daaud or suleman jaise mahaan raajaaon tathaa mahaan avtaron ke vishay main gyaan karaayaa he jinhone samay samay par utpann hokar apane drudh vachanon dwaara anuchit maarg par arudh janata ko tokaa
 It has been the same sequence till Sevanola

 The Bible also shows about bloodpipes like Abraham, fierce violent kings and uncivilized queens
 yah janata kii aitihaasik ghatnaon or tithiyon kii samhita he
 In the inevitable small boundaries of a book, despite its virtually ethnic history, it is full of surprising truths
 pracheen dharmaniyam kii samaapti ke saath usamen ek aakasmik parivartan hota dikhaai detaa he
 History remains the same but its nature changes
 yahudiyon kaa bhayankar ishwar hataa diya jaataa he or kalpana main bhartiya dhang kaa ek snehi ishwar ubhad aata he
 Perhaps the first blurred images of such a trend are found in some incarnations of the heart of ancient Dharmanium itself, especially in Isaiah etc
 kintu ishwar ke sambandh main yah ibranio kii koi anupatik kalpana nahin he
 His feeling was eye to eye
 lekin jab isa ne unase kaha ki ve unke daayen gaal par thappad jamaanevaale ke saamne apana bayen gaal bhi pher den, ve aise krantikari darshan or hinsa ke nipat asweekaar kii baaten na samaj sake
 Thus, he disqualified the author of this new religious belief and eventually gave it to him
 kintu us din galgotha naamak sthaan par cross se pravaahit raktabinduon kii dhara ne ek nae dharm ko janm diya
 The Christian people see him as a symbol for themselves and preach the words of Jesus

 No one thought that those who indulged in the homogenously recited singing found in secret and furnished tendons or cottages inside Rome, which were previously only suitable for the sake of the deposits of the fierce Roman festivals, would one day only see the royal power of Rome We will not only shake you, but will build a better and more glorious Rome-like Sanatan Nagar in the coming days

 Although here he was not a Roman corps but saints with tables and clergymen, who passed away in thousands laughing to death, he preached biblical messages among Europe's rambunctious and uncivilized people
 bible ke shabdon ne un asabhyon kaa aanshik rup se sabhy banaaya
 Thus the Church or Institute of Christianity continued to dominate Europe's mind for at least a thousand years, with its full coverage

 But the same church, which originally developed to fight against tyranny and oppression, now itself became the biggest bearer of oppression and autocracy
 pun: bible janata ko sankatmukt karne ke liye aage ai
 This in itself is a contradiction

 Originally written in Hebrew and Arabshek, it was 400 AD Was translated into Latin by St

 and this authentic translation was used by the Roman Catholic Church
 kintu latin sarvasaamaanya logon kii bhashaa na thi, duusare isai dharmaguru bhashaaon yaa foohad boliyon main hue bible ke anuwaadon se bahut chidhate the
 This was not only because the Christian leaders wanted to maintain their position of privilege, although there was an abundance of it, they were afraid that their words would not lose the power and intent of the divine words by being translated into the colloquial language

 Their leader, Vikliffe was a man of amazing courage and erudition
 usne anubhav kiya ki vichaarparivartan ke liye logon ko isa ke upadeshvachanon kii jaankaree aavashyak he
 For this, translation of the Bible into the public language became necessary
 is prakaar us kaal kii naveen chetana vicliff kii aawaaj main dhvanit hui
 Wikliffe occurred at a time when English prose had little power to express the full opulence and beauty of the Bible

 Nouns have a special place in syntax, and the imperative of divisions today was not even there at that time, because it was a great real fantasy that the Jews had their own and their sensitiveness to words

 Apart from this, the theme of ancient Dharmanium is widely accessible

 Finally, the New Testament contains the words of Jesus in the law
 at: unhen samajhane main thodi bhi chook athwa bhram ho jane par na keval uljhan hi bad jaati he balki sampurna aashay hi bhrasht ho jaataa he
 It is no wonder, therefore, that the churches did not consider the translations appropriate
 phir bhi wiliam tinden ne bible ke angreji anuwaad kaa pratham pramanik prayaas kiya
 He used the original Italian version which was prepared in Italy in the fifteenth century and also resorted to a Wikliffe translation made in the fourteenth century

 Not only did it fill the Hebrew with its innate beauty and elemental power intact, but in proper terms, it acquired a "pictorial" and lyrical quality that was the result of excellent English talent

 Scholars say that his 93 ऽ words are in English

 Then, it was also necessary to have simple words, and as such occasion beauty and restraint were also required

 jab umeo main koi pul nahin tha to yahan ke lok sardiyon main barf ke raaston ke jariye or baaki mausamon main kishtiyon kii madad se ume nadi ko paar karte the
 In 1809, when the Russians captured Umeo for the second time, the Russians built a floating bridge to cross the river
 haalanki wo pul baadh ke aane kii vajah se barabaad ho gaya tha
 The construction of a bridge across the Ume River was considered very important, but when Gustaf Munth became governor in 1856 and 1858, he showed interest in this work
 unhone hidaayat di ke khoj karke dekha jaae ki kis sthaan par pul bananaa sabase uchit rahegaa, isaki tasviren banavaai jaaen or iske kharche kaa anumaan lagaaya jaae
 Upon searching, it indicated that it would be appropriate to build a bridge just outside the city
 iske kharche kaa anumaan 65,450 krobor lagaaya gaya or mazdooree ke saath yah 86,000 krobor hoga
 This bridge was opened in 1863 and for a long time, the travelers had to pay for using this bridge

 Ego Brahmasmiadvaita Vedanta This is one of the many ideologies of philosophy propounded in India, whose Adi Shankaracharya was the awardee
 bharat main parabrahm ke swaroop ke bare main kai vichaardhaaraein hain
 In which there are many theoretical ideologies like dvaita, advaita or kevaladvaita, vishvadvaita, shuddhavaita, dvaitaadvaita
 jis acharya ne jis rup main brahm ko janaa uskaa varnan kiya
 Despite having so many ideologies, everyone believes that God is the destiny of this creation
 advait vichaardhaara ke sansthaapak shankaracharya hai, jise shankaradvait yaa keoladvait bhi kaha jaataa he
 Shankaracharya believes that Brahm is the truth in the world
 baaki sab mithyaa he 
 Jiva cannot know Brahma only because of ignorance, whereas Brahma is seated inside him
 unhone apane brahmasutra main "ahan brahmasmi" aisa kahkar advait siddhant bataaya he
 Vallabhacharya considers Brahma, Jiva and Jagat, all three to be true in his Shuddhadvaita philosophy, which has been proved by the Vedas, Upanishads, Brahmasutra, Gita and Srimad Bhagavat
 advait siddhant charachar sristi main bhi vyaapt he
 When the thorn pricks the feet, then water comes from the eyes and the hand goes to remove the thorn
 ye advait kaa ek uttam udhaaharan he
 Shankaracharya's view was 'ekobrahm, Second Nasti'
 sristi se pehle parambrahm vidyaman the
 Brahma is the truth and the universe is immaterial
 shankaracharya ke mat se brahm nirgun, niskriy, sat-asat, kaary-kaaran se alag indriatit he
 Brahman cannot be seen with the eyes, cannot be known by the mind, it is not the knower nor the known, the past of knowledge and action
 maaya ke kaaran jeev ‘ahan brahm’ kaa gyaan nahin kar paata

 aadhunik prachlan main, sofist vah vyakti he, jo dusron ko apane mat main karne ke liye yuktiyon, evam vyakhyaaon kaa avishkaar kar sake
 But this is not the original meaning of "sophist"
 pracheen unani darshankaal main, gyanashrayi darshanik hi sofist the
 "philosoph" was not popular then
 isa purv paanchavin tathaa chauthi shatabdiyon main yunaan ke kuch simavarti darshanikon ne saanskrithik vichaaron ke viruddh andolan kiya
 The city of Athens was the center of ancient Greek culture
 vahaan is andolan kii hansee udayi gai
 Some of Aflatoon's dialogues are named after philosophers called sophists
 unamem sucraat or pramukh sofiston ke bich vivaad prastut karte hue ant main sofiston ko nirutar kara diya gaya he
 Socrates' renunciation had caused him so much respect in Greece that, considering Socrates an opponent of the Sophist movement, tradition considered the term "sophist" to be defamatory
 vastut: sophist darshanikon ne hi unani sabhyataa kaa maanvikaran kiya
 Before that, no Greek philosopher had ever considered man the creator of civilization and culture
 ekian sabhyataa main, jisaki jhalak haamar ke elliod naamak mahakavy main milti hai, sristi kaa bhaar olympus ke devi devataaon ko saunpa gaya tha
 In the sixth century BC, the philosophy that originated due to reluctance from the Gods and Goddesses, that nature, or destiny, was considered the mother of the world and its entire motion method
 kintu sofist vichaarkon kaa dhyaan is vichaar ke pratyaksh rup kii ore gaya
 He observed that Devaputra, or Prakritiputra, was beset by Greek noble practice
 unhone samaaj ko swatantra purushon evam daason main vibhajit kar rakhaa tha
 There was no framework for public education
 upekshit varg kaa jankaryon main koi sthaan na tha
 Any plan of change could be expected to succeed only if man was given credit for preserving the old corrupt traditions
 atev sofiston ne prakrutivaadee darshan ke sthaan par maanavvaadi darshan kii sthapana kii
 In the dialogue called "protagoras" of Aflatun, it is called from the mouth of the famous sophist Protagoras - Man is the measure of all things, that they are that which they are, that they are not that they are not
 yahi sofist vichaarkon ke darshan kaa mukhya swar tha
 That is why the teachers of ancient traditions ridiculed him as "sophist"
 kintu unani sabhyataa ke janajagran ke ve agradoot the
 Sophist thinkers started educating everyone by eliminating the discrimination between civil and slave
 sofiston ne kahin apane vidhyalay sthapit nahin kiye
 They roamed around and taught
 ni:shulk shikshan ke ve samarthak na the, kyonki unhone isi kaary ko apana vyavsaay bana liya tha
 Never before in Greece, in the form of art, was the teaching of speech
 sofiston ne, jankaarya ke liye bhaashan kii yogyata anivaary samajhakar, yuvakon ko sambhashankala sikhaanaa prarambh kiya
 Sophists named Asemax and Theodorus prepared comments on the subject for their students
 arestu ne inke rin ko sweekaar nahin kiya kintu apane "retariks" main usne inaki do hui saamagree kaa upyog kiya tha
 Prodicus wrote books to explain the meaning of similar words
 shiksha kii drushti se yah kaary us pracheen kaal main kitna mahatvapurn tha jab unani bhashaa ke shabdkosh kaa nirmaan nahin hua tha
 Not only this, sophists also prepared lessons on science etc
 prasiddh he ki sofist kisi bhi shabd kaa manamaana arth kar lete the
 But there is another side to his work
 tab tak kisi simit vyakhyapaddati kaa vikaas nahin hua tha
 This work of sophists opened the eyes of the thinkers and they understood that only by restricting the rules of thinking, interpretations can be limited
 arestu ke "tadatmya ke niyam" ko sofiston kii swatantra vyakhyapaddati kaa fal maananaa sambhavat: anuchit na hoga
 Tradition holds sophists to be nurturers of gross individualism
 kintu protagoras ke kathan ko ki "manushya hi sab vastuon kii maap he" yadi us samay tak viksit darshanik maton kaa ek sankshipt tippanee maane to koi badi bhul na hogi
 Philosophers had no criterion for thinking, nor did they have any style of thinking
 paashchaatya tark kaa janmdata arestu to baad main hua
 Therefore, the independent interpretation of sophist thinkers can be said to be the reason for the logical rise of Greek philosophy

 vishisht arth main vidhishastra ko teen bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya he jinhen samand ne kramshah vishleshnatmak vidhishastra, aitihaasik vidhishastra evam naitik vidhishastra kaha he
 It is worth mentioning that there is such a close relation between the various aspects of the law that the subject of jurisprudence will be left incomplete due to their separate discussion
 atah vidhishastra ke adhyayan ke liye in teenon kaa samavesh aavashyak he
 Analytical jurisprudence refers to the analysis of elementary principles of method
 is vishleshan main unke aitihaasik udgam athwa vikaas yaa naitik mahatv aadi kaa nirupan nahin kiya jaataa he
 The pioneer of this branch of jurisprudence was John Austin, who presented the ideas of this branch to various problems of forensic science in his well-known book 'the Princess of Jurisprudence Determined' first published in 1832
 is shakha ke anya samarthak markabi, amos, holland tathaa samand hai
 Analytical thinking was mainly initiated by Bentham towards the end of the eighteenth century, which was later developed by Austin
 ise pramanvadi vichaardhaara bhi kaha jaataa he
 Samand calls it systematic jurisprudence and CK Allen normative doctrine
 is vichaardhaara kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki jis prakaar bhautik-vigyaan vishleshan ke bal par aage badhata he thik usee prakaar yah kisi cheez ko bina vishleshan ke yathaavat sweekaar nahin kar leti
 Like the natural ideology, it does not consider law to be divine or divine or received, but rather it originates from the sovereign state
 yah vichaardhaara vidhik niyamon kaa vishleshan karti he
 Therefore, it is different from historical or sociological ideology
 yah vichaardhaara naagarik vidhi tathaa anya vidhiyon ke parsparik sambandhon kaa adhyayan vishleshnatmak dhang se karnaa chaahati he tathaa vidhi ko praapt nahin apitu nirmit maanati he
 This ideology has no meaning in what is the origin of the method's historical progress
 julius stone ne thik hi kaha he "isaki pramukh dilchaspee vidhik bhavarthon ke vishleshan or vidhik tark vaakyon ke taarkik antah sambandhon ke bare main khojbin karnaa he
 "samand has expressed the purpose of this ideology in these words - munro smith ke anusaar yah vichaardhaara rajya kii sachetan muhar kanoon ke liye aavashyak maanati he
 In this sense method is the expression of conscious and fixed human desire
 pramanwad ek vaigyanik drushtikon pradaan karata he jisase anubhav se pare pariklpanaaon ko asweekaar kar aankadon dwaara prastut anubhav tak hi simit rahaa ja sake
 This approach is limited to the analysis of the given facts and does not go away from the phenomena of cognition
 ateet tathaa bhavishya kii pariklpanaaon se dur rahakar ‘vidhi jaisi he’ ke tathyaatmak adhyayan ke kaaran ise pramanvadi drushtikon naam diya gaya he
 Being mainly prevalent in England and being associated with Austin, it is also called 'english School' or 'austenian School'
 ise vidhi ko samprabhu kaa samadesh maanane or use maane jane kii baadhyataa ke kaaran aagyaatmak siddhanth bhi kaha jaataa he

 keshav yaa keshavadas 1555 vikrami or mrityu 1618 vikrami) hindi sahitya ke reetikaal kii kavi-trayee ke ek pramukh stambh hai
 He is an ancient Acharya and poet of Hindi who has given a proper introduction to Sanskrit poetry
 inkaa janm sanadhy brahman kul main hua tha
 His father's name was Kashiram, who was a special affection of Odchanaresh Madhukarshah
 madhukarshah ke putr maharaj indrajit singh inke mukhya ashrayadata the
 He considered Keshav as his guru
 rasikapriya ke anusaar keshav orcha rajtargat tungarai ke nikat betwa nadi ke kinare sthit orcha nagar main rahete the
 Acharya Keshavdas was born in 1546 AD in Orchha
 ve sanay brahman the
 His father's name was Pt Kashinath
 orchha ke rajdurbar main unke parivaar kaa bada maan tha
 Keshavdas himself was the court poet, minister and guru of Indrajeet Singh, brother of Orchha Naresh Maharaj Ramsingh
 indrajit singh kii ore se inhen ikkis gaanv mili hue the
 He lived a luxurious life with self-respect
 keshavadas sanskrit ke udbhat vidwaan the
 Sanskrit was also promoted in his family
 naukar-chaakar bhi sanskrit bolte the
 In his family too, leaving Sanskrit and poetry in Hindi language, he found it somewhat humiliating - keshav bade bhavuk or rasik vyakti the
 It is said that once in old age he was sitting at a well
 vahaan pani bharne ke liye ai hui kuch striyon ne unhen baba kahkar sambodhan kiya
 On this, he said the following couplet - samvath 1608 ke lagbhag jahangir ne orchha kaa rajya vir singh dev ko de diya
 Keshav stayed in the court of Veer Singh for some time, then went to the Gangat and started living there
 1618 isvi main unka dehavsaan ho gaya
 The nine authentic texts composed by Keshavdas are: Rasikapriya, Kavipriya, Nakhshikh, Chandmala, Ramachandrika, Veerasinghdeva Charit, Ratanbavani, Vigyanagita and Jahangir Jaschandrika
 rasikapriya keshav kii praudh rachana he jo kavyashastra sambandhi granth hai
 Symptoms of rasa, vritti and kavyadoshas are given in it
 iske mukhya aadhargranth hai - naatyashaastra, kamasutra or rudrabhatt kaa shringartilak
 Kavipriya is a poetry-related treatise which was presented for Indrajit Singh's Rakshita and Keshav's disciple Pravinaray
 yah kaviklpaltavriti or kavyadarsh par aadhaarit he
 Ramachandrika is his most famous epic, in which the content has been taken from many texts like Prasannaraghava, Hanumannakataka, Kadambari etc
 ratanbavanee main madhukarshah ke putr ratansen, veerasingh charit main indrajeetsingh ke anuj veerasingh tathaa jahangir jaschandrika kaa yashogaan kiya gaya he
 There is non-scriptural poetry based on Prabodh Chandrodaya in Vigyangeetha
 keshav alankaar sampradaiwaadee acharya kavi the
 Therefore it was natural that they would follow the Acharyas of the Alankar sect like Bhamah, Uddhat and Dandi
 inhone alankaaron ke do bhed maane hai, saadhaaran or vishisht
 Under the ordinary description, Variya, Bhumishree-narration and Rajyashree-narration, which are based on poetic imagery and ornamentation
 is tarah ve alankaarya or alankaar main bhed nahin maanate
 Due to a special interest in ornaments, the poetic aspect has been suppressed and these are generally not considered to be gentle poets
 apni clishtataa ke kaaran ye kathin kavy ke pret kahe gaye hai
 Specific management is not excellent in terms of Ramachandrika management, identification of poignant places, nature description etc
 parampara paalan tathaa adhikadhik alankaaron ko samavisht karne ke kaaran varnanon kii bharmaar he
 In the description of chahal-pahal, Nagar Shobha, Decoration etc
, he has more mood
 sanvaadon kii yojana main, naatakeey tatwon ke sannivesh ke kaaran, inhen vishesh safalataa mili he
 Their simplicity has been expressed at more places in the Muktakas than in the arrangements
 keshav darbari kavi the
 Like other courtly poets, they have also celebrated their refugee kings
 vir singh dev charit or jahangir jas chandrika unki aisi hi rachanaaen hai
 The second form of Keshava is that of Acharya
 kavi-priya or rasik-priya main inhone sanskrit ke lakshan, granthon kaa anuwaad kiya or udhaaharan swaroop apni kavitaaon kii rachana kii
 The theme of Ram Chandrika is Rama-bhakti but Keshava poets were first, devotees later
 atah unamem bhakthi-bhaavana kii apeksha kavy-chamatkaar ke pradarshan kii bhaavana adhik he
 In the Science Gita, Keshav expresses feelings related to asceticism
 rajdarbaron kii saaj-sajja ke bich rahane ke kaaran keshav kii pravriti prakruti main nahin rahi
 His nature-portrayal is flawed
 usamen parampara kaa nirvaad adhik he, moulikta or naveenta kam
 Keshav has not even taken care of time and place in narrating
 alankaaron ke boj se dabi prakruti apana sahan saundarya kho baithi he
 Keshav's fantasies regarding nature have become very inconsistent and uninteresting at some places
 arun surya ko kapalik kaal kaa rakt se bharaa kapaal bana dena kase kaa chakar prathit hoga - Being a court poet, the eloquence of the courts was present in Keshav
 atah sanvaadon kii yojana main unhen asaadhaaran safalataa mili
 His dialogues are very attractive
 unamem rajdarbaron jaisi haazir-javaabi or shishtataa he
 The characters are inaugurated beautifully by them
 janak-vishwamitra samvaad, lav-kush samvaad, sita-hanuman samvaad isi prakaar ke samvaad hai
 See an answer and answer under 'angad-ravana-dialogue' - ravan- Angad- acharya keshavadas ucchkoti ke vidwaan the
 Therefore, there is more yoga in his poetry and imagination
 unka dhyaan jitna paanditya-pradarshan kii ore tha utana bhav-pradarshan kii ore nahin
 Due to this trend of erudition, some critics have called Keshav a heartless poet, but this allegation is not completely true, because along with the performance of erudition, there are many places in Keshav's poetry where his sentimentality and warm-heartedness came true
 is
 ashok vatika main hanuman ji sita ji ko ramchandra ji kii mudrika dete hai
 How expressive Sita ji's statement towards the ring is- keshav ne apane kavy kaa madhyam brajabhasha ko banaaya, parantu brajabhasha kaa jo dhalaa hua rup sur aadi asht chhap ke kaviyon main miltaa he vah keshav kii kavita main nahin
 Keshav was a Sanskrit scholar, so his language is heavily influenced by Sanskrit
 unhone sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon ko hi nahin, sanskrit kii vibhaktiyon ko bhi apanaaya he, kahin-kahin to unke chhandon kii bhashaa sanskrit hi jaan padati he- There is also a lot of mixture of Bundelkhandi language in Keshav's language
 khaarak, thorila, dugai, gauramadine aadi jaise bundeli shabdon kaa prayog baraabar unke kavy main hua
 Words of the period language are also used
 jaise - ihaan, uhaan, dikhau, rijhaau aadi
 Keshav has coined the words at some places
 jaise - chaap se chaapkeey
 Even in the use of obsolete words, he worked with complete freedom
 jaise - alok, laanch, nari aadi
 The use of the word poison in the meaning of water is found only in the language of Keshava - sanskrit or bundelkhandi ke atyadhik prabhaav, lambii-lambii shabd-yojana aprachlit shabdon ke prayog aadi ke kaaran keshav kii bhashaa main kahin-kahin atyant vilshtataa aa gai he
 The general form of Keshav's language is relatively intelligible
 usamen kahawaton or muhaavaron kaa bhi yatha-sthaan prayog hua he
 Look at the use of the phrase Lajna die - keshav kii style par unke vyaktitv kii chhap spasht drushtigochar hoti he is sambandh main unhone apane kisi purv kavi kaa anusaran nahin kiya
 His poetry can be easily identified among the poems of many poets
