 After that Maharaj Shantanu spent thirty-six years wearing a Brahmacharya fast
 phir ek din unhone ganga ke kinare ja kar ganga se kaha, "gange! aaj meri ichha us balak ko dekhne kii ho rahi he jise tum apane saath le gai thim
 "ganga appeared as a beautiful woman with that child and said," Rajan! This is your son and its name is Devavrata, take it
 yah parakramee hone ke saath vidwaan bhi hoga
 In astrology it will be similar to Parashurama
 " maharaj shantanu apane putr devvrat ko paakar atyant prasann huye or use apane saath hastinapur laakar yuvaraj ghoshit kar diya
 One day Maharaj Shantanu was roaming on the banks of Yamuna that he saw a beautiful girl riding a boat in the river
 uske ang ang se sugandh nikal rahi thi
 Maharaj asked the girl, "oh God! Who are you?" The girl told, "maharaj! My name is Satyavati and i am a Nishad girl
 " maharaj uske rup yauvan par riz kar tatkaal uske pita ke paas pahunche or satyavati ke saath apane vivaah kaa prastaav kiya
 On this Dhinwar said, "rajan! i have no objection to my daughter marrying you, but you must make the son born of my daughter's womb the heir to your kingdom
" 
 "on hearing these words of Nishad, Maharaj Shantanu returned quietly to Hastinapur
 satyavati ke viyog main maharaj shantanu vyakul rahane lage
 His body became weaker day by day
 maharaj kii is dasha ko dekh kar devvrat ko badi chintaa hui
 When he came to know the reason of this type of father's condition by the ministers, he immediately went to Nishad's house with all the ministers and he said to Nishad, "O Nishad! You are happily married your daughter Satyavati to my father Shantanu
 Please do it
 main aapako vachan detaa hoon ki aapaki putree ke garbh se jo balak janm legaa vahi rajya kaa uttaradhikari hoga
 In the long run, if any of my children do not take away the rights of your daughter's children, i pledge that i will remain unmarried for a lifetime
 " unki is pratigya ko sun kar nishad ne haath jod kar kaha, "he devvrat! aapaki yah pratigya abhootpurv he
 "having said this, Nishad immediately sent his daughter Satyavati along with Devavrata and his ministers to Hastinapur
 devvrat ne apni mata satyavati ko laakar apane pita shantanu ko saunp diya
 The father was pleased and said to the son, "watts! You have pledged paternity, such a promise that no one has done till date and will not do in future
" main tuje vardaan detaa hoon ki teri mrityu teri ichha se hi hogi
 Because of your vows, you will be called Bhishma and your pledge will always be known as Bhishma pledge
 " Satyavati had two sons named Chitrangad and Vichitravirya
 shantanu kaa swargvaas chitrangad or vichitraveery ke balykaal main hi ho gaya tha isaliye unka paalan poshan bhishma ne kiya
 Bhishma installed Chitrangad on the throne as he grew up, but in a short period, Chitrangad was killed while fighting with Gandharvas
 is par bhishma ne unke anuj vichitraveery ko rajya saunp diya
 Now Bhishma was worried about the marriage of Vichitravirya
 unheen dinon kashiraj kii teen kanyaon, amba, ambika or ambalika kaa swayamvar hone vaala tha
 Going to his swayamvara, Bhishma alone defeated all the kings who came there and after killing all the three girls brought them to Hastinapur
 badi kanya amba ne bhishma ko bataaya ki vah apana tan-man raaj shalve ko arpit kar chuki he
 On hearing this, Bhishma sent him to King Shalva and got Ambika and Ambalika married to Vichitravirya
 raja shalve ne amba ko grahan nahin kiya atah vah hastinapur laut kar aa gai or bhishma se boli, "he arya! aap mujhe har kar laaye hai atev aap mujhase vivaah karen
 "but Bhishma did not accept his request because of his promise
 amba rusht ho kar parashuram ke paas gai or unase apni vyathaa suna kar sahaayta maangi
 Parshuram said to Amba, "oh God! Don't worry, i will get you married with Bhishma
 " parashuram ne bhishma ko bulaava bheja kintu bhishma unke paas nahin gayi
 Angry at this, Parashurama reached Bhishma and a terrible war broke out between the two heroes
 donon hi abhootpurv yoddha the isaliye haar-jeet kaa faisla nahin ho sakaa
 After all, the Gods intervened and ended this war
 amba niraash ho kar van main tapasya karne chali gai
 Vichitravirya indulged in indulgence with both her queens, but she had no children with both queens and died of tuberculosis
 ab kul naash hone ke bhay se mata satyavati ne ek din bhishma se kaha, "putr! is vansh ko nasht hone se bachaane ke liye meri ajna he ki tum in donon raniyon se putr utpann karo
 "hearing Mata, Bhishma said," Mother! i cannot break my vows under any circumstances
 " Mother Satyavati felt very sad to hear this
 achaanak unhen apane putr vedavyas kaa samaran ho aayaa
 As soon as he remembered, Ved Vyas appeared there
 satyavati unhen dekh kar boleen, "he putr! tumhaare sabhi bhai nihsantaan hi swargavaasi ho gayi
 Therefore, to save my descendants from perishing, i command you to produce children from their wives
 " vedavyas unki ajna maan kar bole, "mata! aap un donon raniyon se kah dijiye ki ve ek varsh tak niyam vrath kaa paalan karte rahen tabhi unako garbh dhaaran hoga
 "after a year had passed, Ved Vyasa first went to the great queen Ambika
 ambika ne unke tej se dar kar apane netra band kar liye
 Returning to Ved Vyas, he said to Mata, "mata Ambika will have a great son, but he will be blind due to the defect of closing the eyes
 " satyavati ko yah sun kar atyant dukh hua or unhone vedavyas ko choti rani ambalika ke paas bheja
 Ambalika was pale in fear upon seeing Ved Vyasa
 uske kaksh se lautne par vedavyas ne satyavati se kaha, "mata! ambalika ke garbh se pandu rog se grasit putr hoga
 "this made Mata Satyavati even more sad and she ordered the elder queen Ambalika to go to Ved Vyasa again
 is baar badi rani ne swayan na ja kar apni daasi ko vedavyas ke paas bhej diya
 This time Ved Vyas came to Mother Satyavati and said, "mother! This maid's womb will produce a very strategic son who is well versed in veda-vedanta
" " itnaa kah kar vedavyas tapasya karne chale gayi
 When the time came, Dhritarashtra, born from Ambika's womb, Pandu suffering from Pandu disease from the womb of Ambalika, and Dharmatma Vidur from Maa's womb were born
 sukhsagar ke saujany se C: Dhritarashtra and Pandu were born to Vyasa after the demise of Vichitravirya

 vyaavhaarik taur par agar computer ko paribhaashit kiya jaye to ham hardware ko manushya kaa sharir or softver ko uski aatma kah sakate hai
 Hardware is the parts of a computer that we can see with our eyes, touch or work on them with tools

 Computer hardware are familiar with software or software are familiar with and based on computer hardware

 With the development of technology, making such machines became technically possible and economically profitable
 praarambhik computer tantro ko kramadesh dena bahut kathin tha kyonki us samay yah siddhant ki software bhi soochnaaon kaa ek samooh jo kisi yantransh kii smriti main surakshit rahe, praarambhik avasthaa main tha
 At that time, the instructions for the program given to a computer device were written directly on a simple instrument called 'punch card'

 Sayan or Acharya Sayan was the most popular commentator of the Vedas
 sayan ne anek granthon kaa pranayan kiya he, parantu inaki kirti kaa merudand vedbhaashya hi he
 Before these, nobody wrote, the commentary of the four Vedas is not available
 ye 24 varshon tak vijaynagar samrajya ke senapati evam amaatya rahe 
 The early Vedic scholars of Europe and Shri Aurobindo and Shri Ram Sharma Acharya of modern India have also been admirers of his commentary
 yask ke vaidic shabdon ke kosh likhane ke baad sayan kii tikaa hi sarvamaanya he
 Saiyan has instructed the essential facts about his character in his compositions

 His name was Madhwacharya, who came to the end of his life as Vidyacharan Swami of Sringeripeeth
 sayan ke anuj kaa naam tha bhoganath jo sangamanaresh ke narmaschiv tathaa kamaneey kavi the
 Sayan has mentioned his three sons in his treatise called Alankar Sudhanidhi, of whom Kampan was proficient in musicology, Mayan was a prolific poet in prose-poetry and Shingan was a Vedic penetrating the chronology of Veda
 vedbhaashyon tathaa itar granthon ke anusholan se sayan ke ashrayadaataaon ke naam kaa spasht parichay praapt hota he
 Sayan was also proficient in governance and he was not proficient in the work of an army hero in the battlefield
 vijaynagar ke in chaar rajanyon ke saath sayan kaa sambandh tha - kampan, sangam, bukk tathaa harihar 
 Of these, Kampan was the second son of Sangam I
 or harihar pratham ke anuj the jinhone vijaynagar samrajya kii sthapana kii thi
 The Kampans ruled over the eastern region of Vijayanagar
 sangam dwitiya kampan ke aatmaj the tathaa sayan ke pradhan shishy the
 He was under the supervision and supervision of Sayan since childhood
 sayan ne unke adhinsth praant kaa badi yogyata se shashan kiya
 He later attained the mantra of Maharaja Bukkarai and remained prominent in the same Amatyapada even during the reign of his son and successor Harihar II

 Harihara II was the principal Amatya for about eight years till 1438-1444
 prathit hota he ki lagbhag pachchis varshon main sayanacharya ne vedon ke bhashya pranit kiye 
 In this way, the emergence of Sayan took place in the first half of the 15th century Vikrami
 sayan kaa jivan agraj madhav ke dwaara itnaa prabhavit tha tathaa unke saath ghulmil gaya tha ki panditon ko bhi in donon ke pruthak vyaktitv main paryaapt andeh he
 It is primarily necessary to resolve it
 madhavacharya 14veen shatee main bhartiya vidvajjanon ke shikhamani the
 He was not only a scholar of the Vedas, theology and epistemology, his reputation as the savior of the Vedas and the propagator of the Vedic religion has not been tarnished even today
 unheen ke aadhyatmik upadesh tathaa raajnneetik prerana kaa suprinaam he ki maharaj harihar raay ke rup se vijaynagar samrajya kii sthapana kii
 Madhwacharya thus had full support in the establishment of this empire, so he was also reputed as the Prime Minister for the smooth conduct of state work
 yah unheen kii preranashakti thi ki in donon sahodar bhoopalon ne vaidic samskruti ke punarutthan ko apane samrajya sthaapan kaa charam lakshya banaaya or is shubh kaary main ve sarvatha safal hue
 As a result, we can consider Madhwacharya as the forerunner of the Vayman Vedic renaissance in South India in the 14th century
 mimasaa tathaa dharamshastra ke prachur prasar ke nimitt madhav ne anek moulik granthon kaa pranayan kiya- Critics may be skeptical about the composition of the last book, but the six predefined texts are Madhavacharya's unquestioned works
 anek varshon tak mantri kaa adhikaar sampann kar or samrajya ko abhisht siddhi kii ore agrasar kar madhavacharya ne sanyas le liya or shringery ke mananeey peeth par asin hue
 His name was this ashram - Vidyaranya
 is samay bhi inhone peeth ko gatisheel banaaya tathaa panchadshi naamak granth kaa pranayan kiya jo advait vedant ke tatwon ke parigyaan ke liye nitant lokapriy granth he
 In the assembly of the Vijayanagara emperor, Amatya Madhava was a very different person from Madhvacharya, who has written an explanation called Sutparyadipika above Sutasamhita
 sayan ko vedon ke bhashya likhane kaa aadesh tathaa prerana dene kaa shrey inhen madhavacharya ko he
 For this reason, Sayan has named Vedabhashya as "madhaviya Vedarthaprakash"
 sayan ke teen guruon kaa parichay unke granthon main miltaa he- Sayanacharya is adorned with the fame of 'vedabhashyakara'
 parantu vedbhaashyon ke atirikt bhi unke pranit granthon kii satta he jinamein anek abhi tak aprakashit hi pade hue hai
 The names of these texts are- subhashit sudhanidhi - niti vaakyon kaa saras sankalan
 This appears to be his proto-text due to the creation of Kampan Bhupal Kesamay
 praayshchitt sudhaa nidhi - karmvipak naam se bhi prakhyat yah granth dharm shaastra ke praayshchit vishay kaa vivaran prastut karata he

 Metalism - This vivid and elaborate practice of Pannean metals is particularly famous in grammars due to its scholarly and authenticity
 yah madhaviya dhaatuvritti ke naam se prasiddh hone par bhi sayan kii hi ni:sandigdh rachana he - iskaa parichay granth ke upodghaat se hi spashtat: miltaa he
 Vedabhashya - It is a sign of many texts rather than a single book
 sayan ne veda kii chaaron samhitaon, katipay brahmanon tathaa katipay aaranyakon ke upar apane ugantarkari bhashya kaa pranayan kiya
 He built his languages on five Samhita and 13 Brahmin Aranyakas, whose names are as follows: sayanacharya swayan krishnayajurveda ke antargat taittiriya shakha ke adhyeta brahman the
 As a result, firstly he wrote his Taittiriya Samhita and the commentary of the Tatsambdha Brahmin Aranyaka, he later made a commentary of the Rigveda
 samhitabhashyon main atharvaveda kaa bhashya antim he, jis prakaar brahman bhashyon main shatapathbhashya sabase antim he
 Both of these languages were practiced by Pranayan Sain in the reign of Harihara II in the evening of his life
 sayan ne apane bhashyon ko "madhaveey vedarthprakash" ke naam se abhihit kiya he
 Seeing the "madhyavya" adjective with the name of these languages, many critics are paralyzed by considering it to be an undeniable creation of sion, but there is no room for doubt
 sayan ke agraj madhav vijaynagar ke raajaaon ke preranadayak upadeshta the
 With his teachings, Maharaj Harihar and Bukkarai were ready to carry on the important task of revival of Vedic religion
 in mahipatiyon ne madhav ko hi vedon ke bhashya likhane kaa bhaar saunpa tha, parantu shashan ke visham kaary main sanlagn hone ke kaaran unhone is mahneey bhaar ko apane anuj sayan ke hi kandhon par rakhaa
 Sayan has mentioned this in the subtraction of the Rigveda commentary
 falat: in bhashyon ke nirmaan main madhav ke hi prerak tathaa aadeshak hone ke kaaran inkaa unheen ke naam se sambhddha hona koi aashcharya kii baat nahin he
 This is a sign of a husky reverence towards his elder brother from Sayan
 isiilie dhaatuvritti, bhi, "madhaviya" kahalaane par bhi, sayan kii hi ni:sandigdh rachana he jiskaa ullekh unhone granth ke upodghaat main spashtat: kiya he- Certain critics are skeptical about the Vedic interpretations being an attribution
 sanwat 1443 vi
 ke mysore shilaalekh se pataa chalata he ki vaidic maarg pratishthapak maharajaadhiraj harihar ne vidyaarany shripad swami ke samaksh chaturveda-bhashya-pravartak narayan vaaypeyayaji, narhari somyaji tathaa pandri dikshit naamak teen brahmanon ko agrahar dekar sammanit kiya
 Both the time and the subject of this inscription are important
 isamen uplabdh "chaturveda-bhashya-pravartak" shabd is tathy kaa dyotak he ki in teen brahmanon ne vedbhaashyon ke nirmaan main vishesh kaary kiya tha
 These pandits seem to have assisted Saina in the implementation of the Vedic interpretations and therefore, welcoming him in front of Vidyaranya Swami confirms the above conjecture
 itane vipulkaay bhashyon kaa pranayan ek vyakti ke dwaara sambhav nahin he
 As a result, Sayan was revered as the leader of this schism and this work was done only with the help of the eminent scholars of that period
 sayan se pehle bhi veda kii vyakhyaayein kii gai thim
 Some are also available
 paranchu samast veda kii granth raashi kaa itnaa suchintit bhashya itahpurv pranit nahin hua tha
 This Vedbhasya of Sayan must have been written keeping in view of Yagnic laws and rituals, but this does not mean that they have not indicated the spiritual meaning of Veda
 vaidic mantron kaa arth to sarvapratham brahman granthon main kiya gaya tha or isi ke aadhaar par nighantu main shabdon ke arth kaa or nirukt main un arthon ke vishadikaran kaa kaary sampann hua tha
 In Nirukta, only the number of mantras is included
 itane vishaal vaidic waan may ke arth tathaa taatpary ke prakatikaran ke nimitt sayan ko hi shrey he
 Sayan Bhashya really acts as the key to unraveling the mysteries of the odd fortification of the Veda
 aaj vedarth mimasaa kii nai paddatiyon kaa janm bhale ho gaya ho, parantu veda kii arth mimasaa main panditon kaa pravesh sayan ke hi prayatnon kaa fal he
 Today's Vedartha is particularly indebted to the parish critic Acharya Sayan
 maxmooler aadi paashchaatya vidwaanon ne isi bhashya ke val par hi vaidic sahitya main gati badhaaya he
 In the history of Vedartha Mimamsa, the name of Sayan is writable in the Suvarnaksharas

 Khuddi Toilet or Pit Toilet is a type of toilet that collects human feces in a pit on the ground
 In this, either no water is used or one to three liters of water is used per flush in flushed toilets
 Properly constructed and maintained toilets, open defecation can reduce disease spread by reducing the amount of human feces circulating in the environment
 This reduces the transfer of microbes by flies between feces and food
 These germs are the leading cause of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections
 In 2011, about 0

 Basic khudi toilets can be improved in many ways
 One of the methods is to connect a ventilation pipe from the pit to the top of the structure
 This improves air flow and reduces odor of the toilet

 This type of toilets do not require a lid used to cover the floor hole
 Other possible improvements include the construction of floors to drain fluids and the strengthening of the top of the pit with brick and cement rings to improve stability

 Commercialism is the name of an economic principle and practice prevalent in Europe from the 16th to 18th centuries under which the control of the economies of the nation by governments with the aim of increasing the power of the state was encouraged
 vyapaarik kranti ne ek naveen aarthik vichaardhaara ko janm diya
 It began in the sixteenth century
 is naveen aarthik vichaardhaara ko vaanijyawad, vanikwaad yaa vyapaarvaad kaha gaya he
 In France, this ideology was referred to as Colbertism and in Germany to Cameroonism
 1776 i
 main prasiddh arthshaastri adam smith ne bhi apane granth ‘da velth of neshns' main iskaa vivechan kiya he
 Commercialism refers to the economic ideology that aired in the countries of Western Europe, especially in France, England, and Germany in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and developed well by the middle of the eighteenth century
 vaanijyawad kii dharna antarrashtriya vyapaar or usase praapt dhan se sambandhit he
 According to the principle of this commercialism, agriculture and its production can only grow to some extent
 krishi aarthik drushti se kuch seemaa ke baad anutpaadak bhi ho sakati he, par udyogon, vyavsaayon or vaanijya vyapaar kii vruddhi or vistaar kii koi seemaa nahin he
 With industrialization and regular growth of trade, the country will get rich and powerful by acquiring gold and silver
 yah vaanijyawad kaa mul siddhant he
 In commercialism, more emphasis was laid on the merchant class, systematic, assured and regular trade and the procurement and organization of gold and silver
 ‘‘adhik swarna praapt kar adhik balashaali bano’’ yah vaanijyawad kaa naaraa tha
 Increasing wealth increases the economic power and prosperity of the country
 isse raajnneetik lakshya saralata se praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 Internal peace and external invasions could provide protection, so the ruler, politician, thinker, economist, administrator and business class supported commercialism
 sone or chaandi kaa sanchay - vyapaar-vaanijya se dhan kii vruddhi hogi or yah dhan sone, chaandi, heere, jawaharaat, bahumoolya ratna ke rup main praapt kar unka sangrah karnaa chahie
 These are neither perishable nor changeable
 ve har samay or har avasar par prachur sampatti hi rahete hai
 The reserves of gold, silver and gems are symbols of royal power
 is badhate hue dhan se yuddh saamagree praapt kar desh main aantarik shanti or bahya suraksha praapt kii ja sakati he
 Thus commercialism is protective
 antarrashtriya vyapaar - antarrashtriya vyapaar vaanijyawad kaa aadhaar he
 Industrialization in the country and exporting the goods of the country's growing production to other countries
 aavashyak hua to rajya ke kuch vishisht udyogon ko sangrakshan dena chahie or videshi vyapaar ko protsaahit karnaa chahie
 The attainment of wealth from inter-state trade is the basis of victory in wars
 anukool or santulit vyapaar - vyapaar main paryaapt dhan praapt karne ke liye videshon ko atyaadhik maatra main vyapaarik maal beche, par videshon se apane desh main nunatam maatra main maal mangaye
 This means that countries import the minimum and export the maximum
 isse desh ko niryaat karne main bahumoolya dhaatuen-swarna or chaandi-praapt hogi or nunatam aayaat karne se videshon ko bahut kam dhan baahar bhejnaa padegaa
 This principle is called favorable and balanced trade
 aayaat kiye hue maal or vastuon kii keemten niryaat kiye gayi maal or vastuon kii keemton se adhik nahin hona chahie
 There should be a favorable balance between imports and exports
 is pranali ko apnaane se desh main adhik utpaadan hoga, adhik mudra prachlan main hogi, poonjeewaad kii protsaahan milegaa or desh aarthik drushti se balashaali hoga
 Industrial sanctions and commercial control - By increasing the state-based incentives to industrial-businesses in the country, there will not be much production by increasing them
 atyaadhik utpaadan se anek haniyaan hoti hai, jaise berogari main vruddhi, maal ke uthaav kaa abhaav, bhaavon kaa girnaa, arth-vyavastha kaa gadabadana
 Hence production has to be controlled by state laws
 niryaat ko badhaava dene ke liye rajya ko vishesh protsaahan dena padataa he
 Similarly, imports have to be controlled in the form of tax, so that the goods do not become excessively imported
 kinhin vishesh companiyon ko hi aayaat karne kii suvidhaayen di jaati hai
 This is called industrial restrictions and trade controls
 naveen vyapaarik mandiyan evam upnivesh - desh se baahar bheji jane vaali taiyaar vastuon kii khapat ke liye videshon main vyapaarik mandiyon ko praapt karnaa or vahaan se desh ke udyog-vyavsaayon ke liye kaccha maal praapt karnaa
 In order to obtain such trading mandis, powerful states settled their colonies abroad where the goods manufactured in the state could easily be sold at profitable rates
 inhen upniveshon ke bazaaron se kaccha maal bhi saralata se saste daamon par kharid kar desh main aayaat kiya ja saktaa tha
 Due to the availability of raw materials at cheap prices, there will be more production at low cost in the factories and industries of the country
 isse desh ko adhik aarthik laabh hoga
 Thus commercialism paved the way for colonialism and imperialism
 samudri yatraaen or bhugolic khojein - columbus, vascodigama, amerigo, magellan, jaan kebaat jaise saahsee navikon ne jokhimabhari samudri yatraayen karke anek naye deshon kii khoj kii
 Gradually new things were settled there
 europe ke pashchimi deshon ne visheshkar spain, portugal, holland, france or england ne naye khoje hue deshon main apane-apane upnivesh or vyapaarik nagar sthapit kiye
 Raw materials like leather, iron, cotton wool etc
 were obtained from these colonies and manufactured new items from them in their country and sent them to the colonies as exports and in return they got abundant gold and silver
 isse poonji kaa sanchay hua, aayaat-niryaat badha or desh samrudh hua
 Impact of the Renaissance - The Renaissance created a new scientific outlook in Europe, as well as greater interest and aspirations for human life
 maanav jivan ko adhik ruchikar or sukh-suvidha sampann banane kii pravriti ko protsaahan diya gaya
 This led to the rise of materialism
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon kii purti ke liye paryaapt dhan kii maang badi or yah badhata hua dhan vaanijya-vyapaar or udyog-dhandhon se hi praapt ho saktaa tha
 This encouraged commercialism

 It was believed that co-creator Len Win initially intended Logan's origins to be a mutated Wolverine cub, developed by a highly evolutionary, human form of the process, but Vin denies this: eks-men # 98 main woolvarin ke ek jaivik vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki vah duusare eks-main se bilkul alag tha

 Writer Win wanted Wolverine to be of the age of a young adult and possesses supernatural power like spider-man
 This changed when Vin saw 40-year-old Wolverine with maskless hair painted by Cockrum
 Vin initially intended to make Wolverine's claws part of his glove retractable, and both gloves and claws were made of a hard alloy

 Wolverine is a mutant that can improve its survival, both natural and artificial
 uski praathmik utparivarti shakti ek twarit upachaar prakriya he, jo vishisht rup se apane utparivarti chikitsa kaarak ke rup main ullikhit he vah apane sharir ke nasht kshetron kaa nirmaan yaa kshan main kshatigrast karne kii kshamta rakhata he jo ek saadhaaran maanav kii kshamta se pare he
 This artificial improvisation process was achieved during the Weapon x program when his skeleton flowed under indestructible metal
 aisa varnan kiya gaya he ki woolvarin ke thik karne kii gati chot ke pariman par nirbhar karti he
 It was initially characterized as an early treatment of minor wounds, but over the years, the authors have steadily increased its capacity

 If an object made of carbonium is put inside its body, its healing powers Slow down in dramatic ways although they do not fully suppress
 uske upachaar karne kii kshamta bade naatakeey dhang se uski umr badhane kii prakriya ko bhi dhimi kar detii he
 Despite being born in the late 1800s, his physical appearance and vitality are similar to a man's youth
 haalanki uski sab yaaden uske paas he, uski chikitsa kii kshamtaain use maansik aghat se ubarne main varddhit rog nivritti pradaan karte hai jab vah gambhir sankat ke anubhavon se gujarata he
 Wolverine's healing power not only relieves physical discomfort, but also acts as a deterrent to paranormal diseases, toxic drugs and substances

 The ability to diagnose it fills the wounds of his body, but he is not able to suppress the pain he suffers during his illness

 Wolverine did not always have claws in his hands: whenever he felt the need for his claws, they would cut the flesh of his hands and move outward, and each time he felt intense pain
 woolvarin kaa puraa kankal apane panje sahit aanvik rup se atoot mishrit dhaatu ke saath sanchaarit he
 Because of his indulgence, his claws were capable of cutting almost anything solid
 keval ek hi gyaat apwaad tha captain america kaa shield jo ek wibranium-louh mishrit dhaatu se bana tha
 The only substance in the Marvel Universe that was stronger than Adamantium was
 Wolverine's ability to cut a substance completely depends on its force application and the thickness of the substance

 The presence of adamantium makes the natural structure of his bones sterile, he can lift and remove weights to the extent that an ordinary human's bones can be damaged
 aisa chitrit kiya gaya he ki vah steel kii zanjeeron ko tod saktaa he, kai logo ko ekasaath apane sir ke upar uthaa saktaa or ek haath se uthaakar unhen diwaar ke usapaar phenk saktaa he or urasa major ko apane sir par rakhkar kisi kamare se baahar oochaal saktaa he
 Wolverine's vision, smell, and hearing are supernatural
 vah purna spashtataa ke saath ek saadhaaran maanav se kahin adhik dur tak dekh saktaa he yahaan tak ki puri tarah se andhere main dekhne kii kshamta bhi usamen he
 His listening power is also very developed, which allows him to listen to even a far away voice that an ordinary person can never hear
 Wolverine's sniffing power was very strong
 bhale hi prakritik kaarnon se samay ke saath gandh kuch had tak khatm ho chukaa ho lakin woolvarin apni indriyabodh kaa upyog karke gandh dwaara lakshya tak pahunch saktaa tha
 His sense of cognition also allows him to recognize a mutant despite shapeshifting in another form
 He is able to use his senses of sniffing and hearing through concentration like a natural lie-catching machine
 , Detects the change in the heartbeat and smell of the person lying when he lies

 vah aagneyastron sahit anya sabhi tarah ke hathiyaar chalaane main kushal tha, haalanki vah dhardaar hathiyaaron kaa pakshpaati tha
 He had defeated Shang Chi and Captain America in a single-match performance with enough skill
 use sharir or dabaav binduon kaa brihad gyaan tha
 He was also a skilled pilot and was very skilled in the field of espionage and covert operations
 kabhi kabhi jab woolvarin kareeb se nipatata he to usase barsrakar rej main chook ho jaati he
 In this condition he attacks with great intensity like an angry animal and his resistance to cyonic attack increases further
 haalanki vah yah maanata he ki usne badi anichhaa se kai baar apni jaan bachaai he
 Despite having the ability to take one's life very easily, he does not enjoy killing or he does not want to show his berserker rage to anyone
 Logan follows a firm code of personal honor and morality
 apane pashavik swabhaav ke vipareet, woolvarin vastav main bahut budhimaan he

 vah angreji, japani, roosi, chini, cheeni, spanish, arabi or lakota, bol saktaa he or use french, thai, vietnami, german, italvi, portugali, korian or hindi kaa bhi kuch gyaan he

 danta ksharan, jise danta-asthikshay yaa chhidr bhi kaha jaataa he, ek beemaari he jisamen jeevanvik prakriyaayein daant kii sakht sanrachana ko kshatigrast kar detii hai
 These tissues progressively break down, causing tooth decay
 dant-kshay do jeevanuon ke kaaran prarambh hota he: stryptococas mutans or lactobacilas 
 yadi iskaa ilaaj na kiya gaya to, is beemaari ke parinamswaroop dard, daanton kii haani, sankraman or charam sthitiyon main mrityu tak ho sakati he
 Currently, dental caries remains the most common disease throughout the world
 danta-kshay ke adhyayan ko kshay-vigyaan kaha jaataa he
 The presentation of caries may vary; However, risk factors and stages of development are similar
 prarambh main yah ek chote khadiamay kshetra ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he, jo antat ek bade chhidr ke rup main viksit ho jaataa he
 Occasionally, caries can be seen directly, although other methods of detection, such as radiographs, are used for less visible parts of the teeth and to assess the extent of damage
 dant-kshay amla-utpann karne vaale ek vishisht prakaar ke jeevanuon ke kaaran hota he, jo ki kinvan-yogya carbohydrates, jaise sukroj, fructose or glucose kii upasthiti main daanton ko kshati pahunchaate hai
 The mineral content of teeth is sensitive to the increase in acidity caused by lactic acid

 When the ph on the tooth surface drops below 5
5, demineralization occurs more rapidly than remineralization
 iske parinamswaroop daant kaa ksharan hota he
 Depending on the extent of tooth erosion, various treatments can be performed to bring the tooth back to the proper shape, function and beauty, but no known method is available to recover a large amount of tooth structure, although the stem -sell related research points to one such method

 There are generally two types of damage when classified on the basis of condition: smooth surface damage and pits and cracks
 The location, growth, and range of damage on smooth surfaces is different from damage in pits and crevices
 ji
 ve
 blake ne ek vargeekaran pranali viksit kii, jiskaa prayog vyapak paimaane par kiya jaataa he or jo daant main ho rahe kshay kii sthiti par aadhaarit he
 In the original classification, dental caries were grouped into five groups, denoted by the word "range" and a Roman numeral
 gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaale kshay ko shrenee i ke rup main suchit kiya jaataa he; chikani sataha par hone vaali kshati ko aage shrenee II, shrenee III, shrenee IV va shrenee v main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 a category VI was also added to Blake's classification of dental caries and also represents damage on smooth surfaces
 gadde va daraaren daant par sthit sanrachanaatmak chihn hai, jahaan se dantabalk bheetar kii ore mudata he
 The cracks are formed during the development of the grooves, but the enamel at that location is not fully connected
 iske parinamswaroop, dantabalk kii sataha kii sanrachana par ek gaharaa rekhiy gaddha ban jaataa he, jo danta-kshay ko viksit hone va panpane ke liye ek sthaan pradaan karata he
 The cracks are mostly located on the occlusal surface of the posterior teeth and on the palatal surface of the anterior teeth located on the lath
 gadde chote, sui kii nok ke aakaar ke chhidr hote hai, jo adhikanshtah khaanchon ke chor yaa anuprastha bhaag par paae jate hai
 Typically, cupola pits are found on the outer surfaces of molars
 sabhi prakaar ke gaddhon va daraaron ke liye atyadhik gaharaai tak muda hua dantabalk in satahon par maukhik swasthya kaa dhyaan rakh paanaa kathin bana detaa he, jiske kaaran in kshetron main danta-kshati viksit hona adhik aam he
 The occlusal layer of teeth constitutes 12
5% of the total tooth layer, but more than 50% of the total dental damage is found on them
 kul danta-kshayon kaa 90% bacchon ke daanton ke gaddhon va daraaron main hone vaali kshatiyaan hoti hai
 It can sometimes be difficult to identify erosion in pits and crevices
 jaise-jaise ksharan main vruddhi hoti jaati he, daant kii sataha ke sabase paas sthit dantabalk kaa kshay kramshah gaharaai main failane lagata he
 Once this caries reaches the dentin of the dentin and enamel, the erosion spreads laterally
 dant-utak ke bheetar, yah ksharan ek tribhuj pattern kaa paalan karata he, jisaki disha daant ke goode kii ore hoti he
 This pattern of corrosion is uniquely described by two triangles whose bases are connected to each other on the DEJ
 chikani sataha par hone vaale ksharan ke vipareet aadhaar-se-aadhaar kaa yah pattern ek gadde va daraar ke ksharan kaa vishisht pattern he
 There are three types of erosion that occur on a smooth surface
 samipsth ksharan, jise antahsamipsth ksharan bhi kaha jaataa he, samipsth daanton ke bich kii chikani sataha par hota he
 Basic caries occurs on the root surfaces of teeth
 chikani sataha par hone vaala tisare prakaar kaa ksharan daant kii kisi bhi anya chikani sataha par hota he
 Proximal caries are the most difficult to identify
 aksar is prakaar ke ksharan kii pahchaan keval dekhakar yaa danta anveshak ke dwaara maanviya rup se nahin kii ja sakati
 samipsth ksharan do daanton ke sampark-sthal ke thik neeche grav rup se nirmit hota he
 As a result, a radiograph is required to identify proximal caries at an early stage
 blake kii vargeekaran pranali main, pichley daanton par utpann samipsth ksharan shrenee II ke ksharan kehalaate hai
 Proximal caries on the front teeth, if not involving the rodent end, is placed in category III and if the rodent end is involved, it is placed in category IV
 mul ksharan, jinka varnan kabhi-kabhi chikani-sataha vaale ksharan ke ek prakaar ke rup main kiya jaataa he, ksharan kaa teesraa sabase aam prakaar hai or ye saamanytah tab utpann hote hai, jab mul satahen masoodon main ghataav ke kaaran ujagar ho gayi hon
 yadi masoode swasth hon, to mul ksharan ke vikaas kii sambhaavna nahin hoti kyonki jeevanvik plak mul satahon tak nahin pahunch saktaa
 dantabalk kii tulana main mul satahen akhanijeekaran prakriya ke prati adhik asurakshit hoti hai kyonki dant-mul 6
7 piech par akhanijeekrut hona prarambh karata he, jo ki dantabalk ke najuk piech se ucch he
 Despite this, it is easier to prevent the development of root caries than enamel erosion because reabsorption of fluoride is greater in the original than enamel
 antahsamipsth satahon kii tulana main, jiheey satahon kii tulana main jihviy satahon par mul ksharan hone kii sambhaavna sabase zyada hoti he
 The jaw teeth on the jaw are the most common place of original caries, followed by the jaw on the jaw, the forearm on the jaw, the posterior position on the jaw and the teeth on the jaw
 daanton kii chikani satahon par chot lag janaa bhi sambhav he
 Since they occur in all areas of the smooth surface except for interconnected areas, it is easy to identify this type of corrosion and is associated with food that encourages plaque and caries formation
 blake ke vargeekaran ke antargat, ananmukheey athwa jiheey satahon ke paas sthit masoodon par hone vaale ksharan ko shrenee v ke rup main chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Category VI is reserved for the ends of the posterior teeth and the rodent ends of the anterior teeth
 purv varnit do shreniyon ke alaava, ksharangrast chot ko ek daant kii kisi vishisht sataha par unki sthiti ke dwaara bhi varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 The erosion that occurs on the surface of the teeth closest to the cheeks or lips is called "caries erosion" and the surface erosion on the side of the tongue is called gingival erosion
 ananmukh ksharan ko aage kapol or oshthak kaha jaataa he
 Obstructive caries is found on the chewing surfaces of the posterior teeth
 krintak ksharan agrastha daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paaya jaataa he
 Erosions can also be described as "moderate" or "remote"
 madhyam ksharan daanton par kisi aise sthaan se sambandhit hote hai, jo chehre kii madhya-rekha ke nikat ho, jo ki ankhon ke bich se neeche naak kii ore or madhya krintakon ke sampark ke bich kii urdhv dhuree par sthit hoti he
 The position of the teeth distal to the midline is described as distal
 kuch udaahranon main, kshayon kaa varnan kisi anya prakaar se bhi kiya jaataa he, jo iske kaaran kii ore suchit karata ho
 "baby bottle erosion", "early childhood caries" or "baby bottle tooth erosion" is a pattern found in young children with temporary teeth
 isamen jabadon ke agr-bhaag par sthit daanton par sabase zyada prabhaav padane kii sambhaavna hoti he, lekin sabhi daant prabhavit ho sakate hai
 This type of caries gets its name based on the fact that this caries usually occurs as a result of allowing infants to sleep with the sweet liquids stored in their bottles, or to feed infants several times a day
 ksharan kaa ek anya pattern “atyadhik failanevaala ksharan " he, jo anek daanton kii kai satahon par hone vaale unnat yaa atyadhik ksharan ko suchit karata he
 Excessive spreading erosion can be seen in people suffering from dry mouth disease, disregard for mouth health, use of stimulants and / or consuming sugar too much
 yadi atyadhik failanevaala ksharan sir va gardan par purvavarti vikiran ke kaaran ho, to iskaa varnan vikiran-prabhavit ksharan ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 These problems can occur due to autoimmune of the original and when new teeth are growing, reconstruction of the entire tooth or later for unknown reasons
 dow miller ne 1887 main kaha ki "danta-ksharan ek rasinic-paraseete prakriya he, jisamen do charan hote hai-dantabalk kaa akhatikaran, jiske parinamswaroop purna vinaash hota he, tathaa praathmik charan ke rup main dant-utak kaa akhatikaran, jiske baad mulaayam ho chukaa avshisht kaa vilyan hota he
 "in his hypothesis, Dr
 Miller assigned the necessary roles to three factors: ksharanon kii pragati kii dar va pichley itihaas kii ore suchit karne ke liye un par asthaayee vivaran lagu kiye ja sakate hai
 "acute" refers to a rapidly developing condition, while "long-term" describes a condition that has taken too long to develop, including thousands of bars of food and breakfast, of which Many cause some acid demineralization, which is not re-mineralized, eventually resulting in pores
 fluoride upachaar daant ke dantabalk punarkhatikaran main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Recurring caries, also known as secondary caries, are caries that occur at a location that has a long history of erosion
 aksar yah bharaai or anya danta prayaavartanon par paaya jaataa he
 Early erosion, on the other hand, is used to describe a decay at a place that has not experienced any decay before
 roka gaya ksharan kisi aise daant par ek chot kaa varnan karata he, jo pehle akhanijeekrut ho gaya ho, lekin jise koi chhidr utapann hone se pehle hi punarkhanijeekrut kar liya gaya ho
 Using fluoride treatment can be helpful in recalibration
 prabhavit hone vaale utakon ke aadhaar par, ksharanon kaa varnan dantabalk, dant-utak yaa dant-mul rakhane vaale ksharanon ke rup main kiya janaa sambhav he
 At the beginning of its development, caries is only possible to affect enamel
 ek baar jab kshay kaa vistaar dant-utak kii gahari parat tak pahunch jaataa he, to “dant-utak ksharan” shabdaawalee kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Since cementum is a hard tissue covering the roots of teeth, it is generally not affected by caries until the roots of the tooth are exposed in the mouth
 Although the term "dental caries" can be used to describe caries at the roots of teeth, in very rare situations this erosion only affects the tooth root
 jadon main dant-utak kii ek badi parat ke upar cementem kii ek bahut patali parat hoti he or is prakaar dant-mul ko prabhavit karne vaale adhikansh ksharan dant-utak ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 It is possible that a person experiencing erosion may not be aware of it
 ek nae ksharangrast ghaav kaa sabase pehla sanket daant kii sataha par ek khadiamay safed dhabbe ke rup main miltaa he, jo is baat kii ore suchit karata he ki us kshetra main dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran ho rahaa he
 This is called initial decay
 jab ghaav kaa akhanijeekaran jari rahata he, to yah bhure rang main badal saktaa he, lekin antat yah ek kotkh main badal jayega
 chhidr kaa nirmaan hone se pehle, yah prakriya prativerti hoti he, lekin ek baar chhidr kaa nirmaan ho jane par, daant kii nasht ho chuki sanrachana ko punarutpann nahin kiya ja saktaa
 koi aisa ghaav jo bhure rang or chamkila kaa dikhaai detaa ho, yah darshata he ki kisi samay danta ksharan maujuud the, lekin akhanijeekaran kii prakriya ruk gai he or keval ek daag rah gaya he
 a brownish stain that appears to be dull is probably a sign of active corrosion
 jab dantabalk or dant-utak nasht ho jate hai, to yah chhidr lakshaneey ho jaataa he
 The affected areas of the tooth change their color and feel soft on touching
 ek baar jab kshay dantabalk se hokar guzar jaataa he, to daanton kii nalikaayen, jinamein daant kii nason tak jane kaa maarg hota he, ujagar ho jaati hai, jisase daant main dard hone lagata he
 This pain may increase further when exposed to hot, cold or sweet food and drinks
 danta-kshay ke kaaran saanson main badboo or vikrut swaad jaisi samasyaayein bhi ho sakati hai
 In highly developed conditions, tooth infection can also spread to the surrounding soft tissue
 guhamay vivar dhanasrata or ludbig kaa kanthshul jaisi jatiltaaon se jivan ke liye khatra bhi utpann ho saktaa he
 Four main parameters are required for the formation of an erosion: the tooth surface; Caries-causing bacteria; Fermentable carbohydrates; and time
 The caries process has no inevitable consequence and different individuals are sensitive to different categories based on the size of their teeth, oral health habits, and their salivary resistance
 danta ksharan daant kii kisi bhi aisi sataha par ho saktaa he, jo ki munh ke chhidr main ujagar ho rahi ho, lekin yah asthi ke bheetar bachaa lee gai sanrachana par nahin ho saktaa
 There are some specific diseases and deformities affecting the teeth, due to which the risk of erosion can increase in a person
 amelogenesis imperfecta, jo 718 main se 1 or 14,000 main se ek vyakti ke bich hota he, ek aisa rog he, jisamen dantabalk yaa to puri tarah nirmit hi nahin hota yaa aparyaapt maatra main nirmit hota he or daanton se gir saktaa he
 In both cases, the risk of tooth decay may increase because enamel is not able to protect the tooth
 adhikansh vyaktiyon main, danta ksharan kaa praathmik kaaran daanton ko prabhavit karanevaali vikrutiyaan yaa bimaariyaan nahin hotin
 daant ke dantabalk kaa chhiyanbe pratishat bhaag khanijon se milakar bana hota he
 These minerals, especially hydroxyapatite, will become soluble when exposed to acidic environments
 Demineralization of enamel begins at a ph of 5
5
 dantabalk kii tulana main dant-utak va dant-mul main ksharan kaa khatra adhik hota he kyonki unamem khanij kii maatra kam hoti he
 Thus, caries can develop quickly when the root surfaces of a tooth are encountered with gums or other diseases associated with the gums
 haalanki, ek swasth maukhik vaataavaran main bhi daant main danta-ksharan hone kaa khatra bana rahata he
 The structure of teeth can affect the likelihood of caries formation
 jahaan daanton ke gahare khaanche adhik sankhya main tathaa atiranjit hote hai, vahaan gaddhon va daraaron ke vikaas kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 Also, if food particles are buried between the teeth, the chances of corrosion increase
 hamaare munh main anek prakaar ke maukhik jeevanu paye jate hai, lekin aisa mana jaataa he ki un jeevanuon kii keval kuch vishisht prajatiyaan hi dant-kshay ke liye uttaradaayi hoti hai, jinamein strepstococas mutans or lactobacili shaamil hai
 Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscosus, Nocardia spp
 And Streptococcus mutans have a close association with dental caries, especially dental caries
 daaton or masoodon ke aas-paas jeevanu ek chipchipe, malai-jaise rang ke padaarth main jamaa ho jate hai, jise plak kaha jaataa he, jo ek jaev-aavaran ke rup main kaary karata he
 Plaque aggregation at some specific locations is more common than at other locations
 daaton ke bich sampark bindu kii hi tarah charvnak or agracharvanak daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paae jane vaale khaanche bhi sookshmdarsheey avarodhan pradaan karte hai
 Plaque may also collect on the gums
 kisi vyakti ke munh main upasthit jeevanu glucose, fructose or sabase aam taur par sukroj ko kinvan naamak ek glicolitic prakriya ke dwaara lactic amla aadi jaise amlon main parivartit kar dete hai
 If these acids are left in contact with the tooth, they can cause demineralization, which is the process of dissolution of minerals
 haalanki yah prakriya gatij hoti he kyonki yadi laar yaa mouthwash ke dwaara is amla ko niskriy kar diya jaae, to punarkhanijeekaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish can be helpful in remineralization
 yadi akhanijeekaran lambey samay tak jari rahata he, to itani badi maatra main khanij-saamagree kii haani ho sakati he ki shesh rah gaya narm jaev padaarth vighatit ho jaataa he, jisase ek kotor yaa chhidr ban jaataa he
 The effect exerted by such sugars on the development of dental caries is called caries
 yadhyapi sharkara ek baddh glucose va fructose ikai hoti he, lekin vastav main yah glucose or fructose kii samaan maatra ke mishran kii tulana main adhik ksharankari hoti he
 This is because bacteria derive energy from the bond between the glucose and fructose subunits
 enzim dextransukraanez dwaara sukroj ko dexran policecride naamak ek atyadhik chipchipe padaarth main roopantarit karke es
 mutans daant par sthiti jaev-parat se chipka rahata he
 The potential for caries development is also affected by the frequency at which teeth are exposed to caries environments
 bhojan athwa naashte ke baad, munh main upasthit jeevanu sharkara kaa chayapachay karte hai, jiske parinamswaroop piech ko ghataane vaale ek amleey-upotpaada kaa nirmaan hota he
 Over time, ph returns to normal due to the salivary resistance and the dissolved mineral content of the tooth surface
 amleey vaataavaran ke saath hone vaale prayek sampark ke dauraan, daanton kii sataha par upasthit gaiyr-jaivik padaarth kaa kuch bhaag vighatit ho jaataa he or yah do ghanton tak vighatit bana rah saktaa he
 Since there is a risk of tooth erosion during these acidic periods, the development of dental caries is highly dependent on the frequency of acidic contact
 yadi bhojan main upyukt carbohydrate kii paryaapt maatra ho, to yah ksharan prakriya munh main daant ke ugane ke kuch hi dinon ke bheetar prarambh ho sakati he
 Evidence suggests that fluoride treatments slow down this process
 samipsth ksharan ko kisi sthaayee daant ke dantabalk se hokar guzarane main ausatan chaar varshon kaa samay lagata he
 Since the enamel covering the original surface is not as durable as the enamel covering the original head, the original erosion generally increases faster than caries on other surfaces
 mul ksharan par hone vaala yah vikaas or khanijeekaran kii haani dantabalk par hone vaale ksharan kii tulana main 2
5 guna adhik tej hoti he
 In very severe cases, in which oral health is very poor and the amount of fermentable carbohydrate in the food is high, erosion can occur within a few months of tooth eruption due to erosion
 udaahranarth, yadi bachche lagaataar shishu botalon se sharkarayukta peya kaa seven karte hon, to aisa ho saktaa he
 There is a correlation between a decrease in saliva and an increase in corrosion because the immunity of saliva is not present to balance the acidic environment created by certain foods
 As a result, the medical conditions that reduce the amount of saliva produced by the salivary glands, especially the jaw subsystem and the parotid gland, are likely to cause extensive dental caries
 iske udaahranon main szograine syndrome, diabetes melitas, diabetes insipids tathaa sarcidosis shaamil hai
 Antihistamines and antidepressants can also block salivary flow
 utprerak, sarvaadhik kukhyat rup se methilamphetamine, bhi laar ke pravaah ko bahut adhik avaruddh kar dete hai
 catalysts 
 bhaang ke paudhe main paaya jane vaala sakriy rasinic padaarth, tetrahydrokaenabinol, bhi laar ke pravaah ko lagbhag puri tarah roak detaa he or is sthiti ko bolchaal kii bhashaa main “coton mouth " kehete hai
 Together with the excessive intake of sugary drinks and unrefined foods, it greatly increases the extent of caries in the users of cannabis
 iske atirikt, sanyukt rajya america main sabase aamtaur par di jane vaali dawaaon main se tirasth pratishat main inke gyaat dushprabhavon kii suchi main munh ke sookhne kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Radiation treatment of the head and neck can also affect cells located in the salivary gland, increasing the likelihood of caries formation
 tambaakoo kaa prayog kii ksharan ke nirmaan ke jokhim ko badha saktaa he
 Some brands of smokeless tobacco have high sugar levels, increasing the chance of caries
 tambaakoo kaa prayog daanton se sambandhit un bimariyon ke liye ek mahatvapurn jokhim kaarak hota he, jo masoode ko peeche dhakel detii hai
 When the gingiva is attached to the teeth, the root surface becomes more visible in the mouth
 yadi aisa hota he, to mul ksharan ek chintajanak baat hoti he kyonki daanton ko dhankane vaale dant-mul ko amlon dwaara dantabalk kii tulana main adhik saralata ke saath akhanijeekrut kar diya jaataa he
 Currently, there is not enough evidence to support an informal relationship between smoking and spinal caries, but these evidence do point to an association between smoking and root-surface caries
 antargarbhashayi or navjaat shishuon main sise kaa sampark danta kshay ko protsaahit karata he
 In addition to lead, electric charge and all molecules with the same ionic radius of divalent calcium, such as cadmium, mimic calcium ions, and therefore contact with them increases tooth decay
 dantabalk atyadhik khanijeekrut akoshikeey utak hota he or ksharan jeevanuon dwaara prarambh kii jane vaali ek rasinic prakriya ke dwaara ise haani pahunchaate hai
 When these bacteria start consuming sugars and use it for their own energy, then they produce lactic acid
 is prakriya ke prabhaavon main dantabalk main upasthit kanon kaa akhanijeekaran shaamil he, jo ki samay ke bitne ke saath-saath amlon ke kaaran hota he or tab tak jari rahata he, jab tak ki jeevanu shaareerik rup se dant-utak ko bhed na len
 dantabalk kii chaden, jo ki dantabalk kii sanrachana kii moolbhoot ikaiyaan hoti hai, daant kii sataha se dant-utak tak lambavat sthit hoti hai
 Since demineralization of enamel through erosion usually occurs in the direction of enamel rods, different triangular patterns and smooth-surfaced caries develop between the pits and pores in enamel that two areas of tooth enamel rods The situation varies
 jab dantabalk apane khanijon ko kho detaa he or danta ksharan kaa vikaas hone lagata he, to dantabalk main anek spasht kshetra viksit ho jate hai, jinhen ek prakaash sookshmdarshi ke dwaara dekha ja saktaa he
 From the deepest layer of enamel to the enamel surface, the areas identified are: translucent area, black area, body of wound, and surface area
 parbhasi kshetra ksharan kaa pehla drishy sanket hota he or yah khanijon kii ek se do pratishat haani hone par banataa he
 There is little remineralization of enamel in the black zone, which provides an example of how the development of dental caries is an active process with alternating changes
 sarvaadhik akhanijeekaran va vinaash kaa kshetra swatah ghaav kaa mukhya bhaag hi hota he
 The surface area remains relatively mineral-rich and remains present until the tooth structure changes to a pore
 dantabalk ke vipareet, dant-utak danta kshay kii pragati ke prati pratikriya detaa he
 After the creation of the tooth, the aminoblasts that produce enamel are destroyed when the enamel is completed and therefore they cannot be reconstructed after enamel is destroyed
 On the other hand, dentin is produced by the odontoblast throughout its lifespan, which lies between the pulp and dentin
 chunki, odontoblast upasthit hote hai, atah ek utprerak, jaise ksharan, ek jaivik pratikriya ko prarambh kar saktaa he
 These safety procedures include the formation of whiteboard and tertiary dentin
 sabase gahari parat se dantabalk tak sthit dant-utak main, ksharan dwaara prabhavit hone vaale kshetra parbhasi kshetra, vinaash kaa kshetra tathaa jeevanivik chhedan kaa kshetra hai
 The translucent zone represents a moving list of damage processes and is located where the initial demineralization begins
 jeevanvik chhedan tathaa vinaash ke kshetra akramanakari jeevanuon tathaa antat dant-utak ke vighatan ke kshetra hai
 The structure of dentin is an arrangement of microscopic currents, called dentinal tubules, that protrude from the pulp part toward the outer dentin or enamel border
 dant-utak nalikaaon kaa vyas goode ke paas adhik or dant-utak va dantabalk ke sangyojan-sthaan par sabase kam hota he
 The damage process continues throughout the dentin tubules, which are responsible for the triangular pattern resulting from the development of caries deep into the tooth
 nalikaayen ksharanon ko bhi tezi se viksit hone kaa mauka detii hai
 In response, the fluid present in the tubes brings immunoglobulin from our immune system to fight this bacterial infection
 isi samay, aas-paas kii nalikaaon ke khanijeekaran main bhi vruddhi ho jaati he
 This results in the formation of tubules, an attempt to reduce the rate of bacterial progression
 iske atirikt, jab jeevanuon kaa amla hydroxipetic kanon kaa akhanijeekaran karata he, to calcium va phosphorus chode jate hai, jisase adhik sankhya main kanon ke avakshepan kaa mauka miltaa he, jo dant-utak nalikaaon main gahare tak samaa jate hai
 These particles form a barrier and slow the expansion of corrosion
 in rakshaatmak pratikriyaaon ke baad, dant-utak ko shwetapatli mana jaataa he
 It is believed that due to the fluids present inside the tubules of dentin, the pain receptors located inside the tooth pulp become active
 chunki shwetapatli dant-utak aise dravon ke pravaah ko roktaa he, atah sambhav he ki jis dard ne jeevanuon ke akraman kii chetavanee di hoti, vah pehle pahal utpann hi na ho
 As a result, dental caries may continue to progress for a long time without any sensitivity to the tooth, which can lead to great loss of tooth structure
 danta kshay kii pratikriyaswaroop, goode kii disha main or adhik dant-utak kaa utpaadan ho saktaa he
 This new dentin is referred to as tertiary dentin
 tritiyak dant-utak kaa nirmaan aage bad rahe jeevanuon se goode kii yathasambhav raksha karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 When more tertiary dentin is produced, the size of the pulp decreases
 is prakaar ke dant-utak ko mul odontoblast kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti ke anusaar up-vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 If odontoblasts survive for so long that they can respond to dental caries, the dentin produced in this condition is called "reactive" dentin
 yadi odontoblast nasht ho jate hai, to is sthiti main utpann dant-utak ko “sudhaarak " dant-utak kehete hai
 In the case of rectal dentin, other tissues are required to play the role of destroyed odontoblasts
 aisa mana jaataa he ki vikaas kaarak, visheshtah tijief-beta, goode ke fibroblast or messentimal utakon ke dwaara sudhaarak dant-utak kaa nirmaan prarambh karte hai
 Corrective dentin is developed at an average rate of 1
5 μm / day, but can be increased to 3
5 μm / day
 parinamit dant-utak main aniyamit aakaar vaali dant-utak nalikaayen hoti hai or sambhav he ki ve pehle se maujuud dant-utak nalikaaon ke saath panktibaddh na hon
 yah dant-utak nalikaaon ke bheetar aage bad paane kii danta kshay kii kshamta ko gata detaa he
 The primary diagnosis involves inspecting all visible surfaces of the tooth with the help of a good source of light, dental mirror and investigator
 danta radiograph danta ksharan, visheshtah daanton ke bich sthit ksharan, ko kisi anya prakaar se darshneey hone se purv hi dikhaa saktaa he
 Large dental caries can often be seen with the naked eye, but small lesions can be difficult to detect
 danta-chikitsakon dwaara, vishisht rup se gaddhon va chhidron ke ksharan kaa pataa lagane ke liye, radiograph ke saath hi drishy or sparsh-dwaara nirikshan kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Initial, infiltration erosion is often identified by blowing air across the suspect area, which removes moisture and alters the optical characteristics of unmetabolized enamel
 kuch danta anusandhankartaaon ne ksharan kii khoj karne ke liye danta anveshakon kaa prayog na karne kii chetavanee di he
 In situations where a small part of the tooth has started demineralization but has not yet produced a perforation, the pressure from the dental investigator may cause the perforation to form
 chunki, chhidr ke nirmaan se purv kshati kii prakriya ko rokkar lautaaya ja saktaa he, atah fluoride ke saath ksharan ko rokna va daant kii sataha ko punarkhanijeekrut karnaa sambhav ho saktaa he
 When a hole is present, restoration will be required to replace the lost tooth structure
 anek baar, gaddhon va chhidron ke ksharanon kii pahchaan karnaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Bacteria can penetrate enamel to reach dentin, but then the outer surface can be regenerated, especially if fluoride is present
 ye ksharan, jinhen kabhi-kabhi “chhipe hue ksharan ” kaha jaataa he, iske baavjood bhi eks-re radiograph dwaara dekhe ja sakenge, lekin daant kaa drishy pareekshan yah darshayega ki dantabalk avikal he athwa nunatam chhidrit he
 The damaged tooth structure is not completely reconstructed, although remineralization of very small damaged wounds may be possible if hygiene is maintained at its optimum level
 chote ghaavon ke liye, kabhi-kabhi samayik fluoride kaa prayog punarkhanijeekaran ko protsaahit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 For larger wounds, the progression of dental caries can be prevented by treatment
 upachaar kaa lakshya daant kii sanrachana ko banaae rakhana or daant ke or adhik vinaash ko rokna hota he
 Generally, early treatment is less painful and less expensive than late treatment
 asamvedak —sthaneey, nitras oxide "), athwa anya anushansit dawaaen— upachaar ke dauraan yaa iske baad dard ko kam karne athwa upachaar ke dauraan bechaini se raahat dene ke liye aavashyak ho sakati hai
 a dental handpiece is used to remove large parts of the damaged substance from the teeth
 ek chammach ek danta upkaran hota he, jiskaa prayog saavdhaneepurvak ksharan ko nikaalane ke liye kiya jaataa he or kabhi-kabhi iskaa prayog tab kiya jaataa he, jab dant-utak main ho rahaa ksharan goode ke paas tak pahunch jaae
 ek baar ksharan ko hataa diye jane par, daant kii kho chuki sanrachana ko kisi prakaar kii danta punarsthapana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki daant ko punah isaki kaaryaatmakataa va suruchipurna sthiti par waapas laayaa ja sake
 Restorative materials include dental amalgam, composite resin, ceramic and gold
 mishrit raal va chini-mitti ko is prakaar banaaya ja saktaa he ki ve mariz ke daanton ke prakritik rang ke samaan dikhaai den or isaliye jab soundarya ek chintaa kaa vishay ho, to aksar inkaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Mixed restorations are not as strong as dental amalgam or gold; Some dentists consider swarna to be the only recommended restore for the rear teeth, which have too much chewing force
 jab ksharan bahut adhik vyapak ho, to yah sambhav he ki daant kii sanrachana main paryaapt rup se itnaa sthaan na ho ki punarsthapanaatmak padaarth ko daant ke bheetar rakhaa ja sake
 Hence a vertex may be required
 yah punarsthapana ek topi kii tarah dikhaai detii he or ise daant ke shesh bache sheersh ke upar jod diya jaataa he
 The tops are often made of gold, porcelain or metal-ceramic
 kuch vishisht sthitiyon main, daant kii punarsthapana ke liye andodontic upachaar karnaa aavashyak ho saktaa he
 Endodontic treatment, also known as "root canal", is recommended if the pulp in the tooth is destroyed by damage-causing bacteria or due to injury
 During the root canal, the damaged part of the tooth is The pulp of the teeth, including the veins and vascular tissues, is removed
 nalikaaon ko andodontic filon ke auzaaron ke dwaara saaf karke unhen aakaar diya jaataa he, phir saamaanya rup se unhen rabar-jaise padaarth ke dwaara bharaa jaataa he, jise guta parchaa kehete hai
 The tooth is filled and a top can also be added to it
 root kanal ke purna ho jane paar daant ab praan-hin he kyonki yah kisi bhi sajiv utak se rahit he
 Amputation can also be a treatment for tooth erosion
 kshatigrast daant ko hataane kaa nirnay tab liya jaataa he, yadi kshatikaarak prakriya ke kaaran daant itnaa adhik nasht ho chukaa ho ki use prabhavi rup se punarsthapit na kiya ja saktaa ho
 Sometimes resection is considered if there is no opposing tooth available for the tooth or when it may cause further problems in the future, as may be the case with the wisdom teeth
 un sthitiyon main bhi uchhedan ko praathamikta di ja sakati he, jab mariz daant kii punarsthapana main aane vaala kharch yaa takalif na uthaanaa chahta ho
 Personal hygiene care involves cleaning teeth properly and cleaning with soft threads daily
 maukhik swatchta kaa uddeshy munh main beemaari ke kisi bhi hetukeey pratinidhi kii upasthiti ko kam karnaa hota he
 The main purpose of cleaning teeth and cleaning with soft thread is to remove plaque and prevent its formation
 adhikanshtah plak main jeevanu hote hai
 When the amount of bacterial plaque increases, the risk of dental caries increases on the teeth when the carbohydrates present in the food are left on the teeth after every meal or snack
 ek toothbrush kaa prayog abhigamya satahon par se plak ko hataane ke liye to kiya ja saktaa he, lekin daanton ke bich se yaa chabane vaali satahon par sthit gaddhon va daraaron ke bheetar se nahin
 yadi ise sahi tarah se prayog kiya jaae, to danta flos un sthanon se plak ko hataa saktaa he, jin par anyathaa samipsth ksharan viksit ho saktaa he
 Other helpful methods of cleanliness include ingrown brush, water pick, and mouthwash
 haalanki maukhik swasthya sambhawatah danta kshay ke bajaay masoodon kii bimariyon ko rokane main adhik prabhavi he
 Brush and fluoride toothpastes cannot reach the pits and crevices in which food gets trapped while being chewed
 )
 The risk of caries from wound is highest on the first and second forearm teeth
 ) Occupational hygiene care involves regular dental examination and cleaning
 kabhi-kabhi plak ko puri tarah hataa paanaa kathin hota he or danta-chikitsak yaa danta-swasthya vigyaani kii aavashyaktaa pad sakati he
 In addition to oral health, radiographs may be taken during dental inspection to identify potential dental caries development in high-risk areas of the mouth
 daanton ke swasthya ke liye, chini ke seven kii aavriti, upbhog kii gai chini kii maatra se adhik mahatvapurn hoti he
 In the presence of sugar and other carbohydrates, bacteria in the mouth produce acids that can demineralize enamel, dentin, and dentin
 daanton ko aise vaataavaran main laae jane kii aavriti jitani adhik hogi, danta ksharan utpann hone kii sambhaavna bhi utani hi adhik bad jaaegi
 atah naashte kii maatra ko kam se kam rakhane kii anushansa kii jaati he kyonki naashtaa karne se munh main upasthit jeevanuon ko amla-nirmaan ke liye poshan kii satat aapurti milti he
 Also, very chewy and sticky foods stick on the teeth for a long time and as a result they are best eaten as a part of a meal
 bhojan ke baad brush se daanton kii safai karnaa anushansit he
 For children, the American Dental Association and the European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend limiting the frequency of consumption of sugary beverages and not to give infants bottles during sleep
 maataaon ko bhi yah salaah di jaati he ki ve apane bartan or cap apane shishuon ke saath saajha karne se bachein, taaki maa ke munh se jeevanu ke sthanantaran ko roka ja sake
 It has been found that they can be helpful in combating dental caries if specific types of milk and cheese, such as shader, are taken immediately after consuming food potentially harmful to the teeth
 saath hi, daanton kii raksha karne ke liye kuch deshon main chuing gam main zailitol kaa prayog vyapak paimaane par kiya jaataa he or yah finland ke candi udyog main vishesh rup se lokapriy he
 Xylitol is probably effective in reducing plaque because bacteria are not able to use it like other sugars
 It has also been known that chewing and stimulating taste receptors on the tongue increase the production and release of saliva, which contains some natural inhibitors that prevent ph levels in the mouth from going down to the point where enamel is unnaturalized
 It is possible
 danta seelint kaa prayog rokthaam kaa ek madhyam he
 a sealant is a thin plastic-coated layer that is applied to the chewing surfaces of the molar teeth
 yah parat chabaae jane par utpann hone vaale dabaav ke chalate bhojan ko khaanchon ke bheetar gaddhon va daraaron main funs jane se rokatii he, taaki vahaan nivas karne vaale jeevanu us carbohydrate se vanchit rah jate hai, jise ve amla akhanijeekaran main badalte hai or is prakaar yah gaddhon va daraaron main ksharan ke nirmaan ko rokatii he, jo ki danta ksharan kaa sabase aam rup hai
 Sealants are usually applied to the teeth of children shortly after the molar teeth grow
 buudhe log bhi danta seelint se laabh uthaa sakate hai, lekin saamanytah unke danta itihaas or ksharan nirmaan kii sambhaavna par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 Often calcium is found in foods like milk and green vegetables etc
 to prevent dental caries
 yah pradarshit kiya ja chukaa he ki calcium tathaa fluoride sampoorak danta kshay kii ghatnaon ko kam karte hai
 Fluoride helps prevent tooth decay by binding the hydroxyapatite particles of enamel
 samavisht calcium dantabalk ko akhanijeekaran ke prati or is prakaar kshay ke prati, adhik pratirohak banaata he
 Topical use of fluoride is also recommended to protect the lining of the teeth
 isamen fluoride toothpaste yaa mouthwash shaamil ho saktaa he
 Many dentists include the occasional use of fluoride as part of routine checkups
 anya utpaadon, punarkhanijeekaran ke sandarbh main jinaki prabhavakaarita kaa samarthan karne ke liye bahut kam yaa thode vaigyanik pramaan uplabdh hai, main disipidi, asipi, calcium yogic, fluoride, tathaa inamelon shaamil hai
 Remineralization can also be done professionally by a dentist
 iske atirikt, haalia anusandhan yah darshaate hai ki argon aayan leisure ke nimna tivrata vaale leisure vikiran dantabalk ksharan or shwet-chihn ksharan kii sambhaavna ko roak sakate hai
 Since bacteria are the major factors contributing to poor oral health, research is currently underway to find a vaccine for dental caries
 2004 tak praapt jaankaree ke anusaar, jaanwaron par aisi ek dawa kaa prayog safaltaapurvak kiya ja chukaa he, or may 2006 main mili jaankaree ke anusaar abhi yah manushyon ke liye chikitsiya pareekshan charan main he
 Chewing gum chew after meals increases the flow of saliva, which naturally lowers the acidic ph environment and encourages remineralization
 zailitol loli or gam bhi stryptococas mutans kii vruddhi ko rokte hai
 Throughout the world, most children and an estimated ninety percent of adults have experienced caries, and the disease is most prevalent in Asian and Latin American countries and least in African countries
 sanyukt rajya america main, danta ksharan bachapan kii sabase aam dirghakaalik beemaari he or yah asthma kii tulana main kam se kam paanch guna zyaada aam he
 It is the main pathological cause of tooth breakdown in children
 pachaas varsh se adhik aayu ke unttis se unsath pratishat vayask ksharan kaa anubhav karte hai
 The number of cases has decreased in some developed countries and this reduction is generally attributed to improved oral health habits and resistance measures such as fluoride treatment
 iske baavjood, jin deshon ne danta kshay ke maamalon main sakal kami kaa anubhav kiya he, unamem bhi is beemaari ke vitaran main vishmata bani hui he
 Twenty-two percent of the population of children in the United States and Europe is suffering from sixty to eighty percent of the total cases of dental caries
 is beemaari kaa ek isi prakaar kaa asmaan vitaran puure vishwa main dekha jaataa he, jisamen kuch bacchon main shunya yaa bahut kam ksharan he, jabaki anya bacchon main isaki maatra bahut ucch he
 The number of cases of dental caries in children in Australia, Nepal and Sweden is low, while in Costa Rica and Slovakia this number is much higher
 paaramparik “dmef " ) suchakank logon ke bich ksharan ke prachlan or saath hi aavashyak danta upachaar kaa anumaan lagane kii sabase aam vidhi he
 This index is based on the actual medical examination of individuals using a needle, mirror and cotton ball
 chunki dmef suchakank eks-re chithran ke bina banaaya jaataa he, atah yah ksharan ke vaastavik vistaar or aavashyak upachaar ko kam aankata he
 There is a very long history of dental caries
 das lakh varshon se bhi adhik samay purv australopithekas jaise maanav-purvaj danta chhidron se grasit rahe the
 The maximum increase in the extent of erosion has been associated with changes in food and drink
 puratathvik pramaan yah darshaate hai ki danta kshay ek pracheen beemaari he, jo pragaitihaasik kaal main bhi maujuud thi
 The ten-million-year-old cranial date of the Neolithic period shows signs of erosion, although the pre-stone Age and mid-stone Age skulls are the exception

 In the Middle Islamic world, Muslim physicians such as al-ghazar and Avisina) have provided the oldest known treatment of caries, although they, like their ancestors, believed that the causes were dental worms
 1200 isvi main guabari naamak ek anya muslim danta-chikitsak ne is vishwaas ko jhootha sabit kar diya, jo apni pustak book of ellite cancerning da anamasking of mistries and tring of wales main, danta-krimi ko ksharan kaa kaaran maanane ke vichaar ko khaarij karne vaale pehle vyakti the or unhone kaha ki vastav main danta krimi kaa koi astitv hi nahin he
 Thus from the thirteenth century onwards, the doctrine of dental worms in the Islamic world has ceased to be accepted
 europea gyaan yug ke dauraan, europea chikitsa samudaay main bhi is vishwaas ko sweekaar karnaa band kar diya gaya ki ksharan kaa kaaran koi “danta-krimi” tha
 Pierre Fochard, known as the father of modern dentistry, was one of the earliest to deny that dental caries was caused by worms, and noted that sugar was harmful to teeth and gums
 1850 main, ksharan ke prachlan main ek anya teevr vruddhi utpann hui or aisa mana jaataa he ki aisa bhojan main hue vyapak parivartanon ke kaaran hua tha
 Before this time, the most frequent type of caries was caries erosion, but with the increase in availability of sugarcane, refined flour, brew and sweet tea, there was also an increase in caries and cracks
