 In this method, the management cycle is decided by in-depth study of the life cycle, food, effects on humans and other organisms, including the life of the mortal and its natural enemies

 There are many types of parasites such as: egg parasites, pupa parasites, egg parasites, adult parasites etc

 Examples are: prakruti main 90 pratishat keet, unki vibhinn avasthaaen faphund ke akraman se nasht ho jate hai
 Examples of these are: Beauveria bassiana, Metarizium anispli, Hristula, Varticillium linai, etc

 Therefore, it is necessary to identify the insects correctly before using the virus

 Due to the spread of newborns to new places, their natural enemies do not exist there
 vaigyinic unke prakritik shatruon ko vishwa main anya sthanon par khojate hai
 They ensure their safety

 In this method the number of natural enemies already present is increased so that the number of harmful insects is kept below the economic loss level

 This is the most important strategy

 So that the balance of their numbers remains with the harmful insects

 These friendly creatures / natural enemies keep destroying harmful insects and help us keep their numbers below the economic loss level

 unhone ayurveda kii shiksha or aushadhi nirmaan ko aadhunik, secular or vaigyanik rup diya
 Today Kerala's largest brand kerala-ayurveda is the same Vaidya PS
 Warrior has a legacy
 kerala ke kalikat shahar ke nikat kottakal kasbe main 16 march, 1869 ko ek pratishthit parivaar main panniinpalli sankunni variyar kaa janm hua
 Members of this family had a great interest in painting, music and Sanskrit literature
 sankunni variyar kii maan swayan bhi sanskrit tathaa shastreey sangeet main paarangat thim
 The Warrier family had earned their reputation as Ayurvedic physicians
 apane ghar ke kalatmak, dharmik or chikitsakeey vaataavaran ne balak sankunni variyar ke man par sthaayee prabhaav daalaa
 Warrier learned Sanskrit from eminent scholars of his time

 When Warrier completed his Ayurveda education at the age of 20, when he started his clinic at Kottakkal, he realized that Western medicine was becoming very popular in India
 jigyaasu hone ke naate variyar is nayi chikitsa pranali ke bare main seekhney-jaanane ko bahut utsuk the kintu angrezi bhashaa kii agyanta variyar ke liye bahut badi baadha thi
 The warrior began to learn English privately by his own means and soon became fluent in the language

 Upon completion of the treatment, Dr
 V
 Varghese offered to teach Warrier Western medicine, which Warrier accepted with great gratitude and received training in the hospital for the next three years
 apane prashikshan main variyar ne rog ke lakshanon va nidaan ke tareeke, marizon ko pashchimi dawaaon kii khuraaq va vitaran ke tareeke, sangyaaharan dene kii vidhi or maamuli shalya kriya jaisi vidyaayein sikhin
 Moving away from contemporary vaidyas, Warrior also studied indigenous and Western systems in his knowledge, even though his core competence was in Ayurveda
 lekin pashchimi chikitsa-gyaan, vishesh rup se shalya chikitsa, sharir-rachana vigyaan or sharir-vigyaan ne unke drushtikon ko bahut prabhavit kiya
 As a physician, Warrier saw that it was impossible to get pure and proper proportion of the ayurvedic medicines he had recommended
 unhone samaj liya ki upachaar or aushadhiyon ke maanakeekaran ke bagair ayurveda paddati bilkul nasht ho jaaegi
 He felt that when allopathy medicines are being mixed in fixed doses and durable packing and allopathic method is adopting a certain process of treatment, Ayurveda must also adopt transparency in its treatment and medicines
 isi ke baad variyar ne ayurveda ke maanakeekaran ke liye sabase pehle 1902 main kottakal main aushadhi nirmaan hetu arya vaidyashaala kii sthapana kii jahaan unki dekharekh main pramanik ayurvedic granthon ke aadhaar par davaayen banaayi jane lageen
 Like English medicines, for the first time, Arya Vaidyasala made Ayurvedic medicines useful for long time in standard dosage and packing
 ayurvaidic aushadhiyon ne nirmaan ke kshetra main yah ek bahut bada parivartan tha
 In 1907 Warrier founded the Ayurveda Vaidya Samajam
 iske peeche variyar kaa uddeshy allopathy or ayurveda main saamanjasy talashna tha
 As a learned physician, Warrier knew that Ayurveda would have to adopt some of the latest methods of allopathy
 ek ayurveda chikitsak ke rup main variyar anya vaidyon ko behatar prashikshan dena chaahate the
 Warrier had added Ayurvedic practitioners from Travancore, Cochin and Malabar to the Ayurveda Vaidya Samajam
 iske 50 saal baad inhen kshetron kaa vilay kar aadhunik kerala rajya kii rachana hui
 If seen, the warrior envisioned an entire Kerala state long before his time

 yah apane samay kaa ek bada krantikari kadam tha kyonki is ayurveda paathshaala main dharm, jati, varna bhed ke bina chaatro ko pravesh milanaa shuru hua

 To spread the scientific outlook in Ayurveda, Warrier edited an Ayurveda journal called Dhanvantari

 Their aim was to save this glorious knowledge, learning, scripture from extinction and renovate this unique medical science
 1924 main unhone ek dharmarth chikitsaalay kii sthapana kii
 In this Ayurveda hospital, he also arranged for allopathic treatment
 1932 main bharat sarkaar ne pi

 Arrangements were made for the Warrior to cultivate various herbs used in Ayurveda medicines for purity

 Ayurveda does not treat any one disease but all-round treatment of the patient
 isiilie ayurveda main itane saare niyam, sanyam, aahaar, vichaar, dhyaan, dharna par jor diya jaataa he
 Being an outstanding physician, in 1932, Warrier built a grand temple in the courtyard of Arya Vaidyasala to enable the patient to rise above his physical suffering and mental agony

 They have killed 125 criminals in the last five years
 ek purv police adhikari ke anusaar, kaisal ke parivaar kii hatya ek bheed main hui thi, jisamen kaisal bhi maar chukaa tha
 Due to Castle's assassination killing the goons, he came to be called Punisher
 panisher ek naale main rahete hue, sangathit aparaadh ke khilaaf ek-ek aadmi ke maarane lagata hai, jisamen unka ekmaatr dost shaike, ek puraane sharaabi uskaa saath detii he, jo ek purv stage abhinayta bhi hai
 Now legally declared dead, Castle Apami discovers the goons under the guise of the tomb and kills them
 unke ke khilaaf unke yuddh ke kaaran, mafia ke parivaar bahut kamjor ho jaati hai
 All this forces Gianni Franco, the leader of a mafia family, to retire
 is samasya se samaadhaan paane ke liye franco sabhi mafia pariwaron ko ekajute karata hai
 Whereas, Yakaja, Asia's most powerful criminal syndicate, also attracts attention
 ladi tanaaka ke netritv main, yakuja mafia pariwaron or unke sabhi hiton ko khatm karne kaa faisla leti hai
 She kidnaps their children to eliminate mafia families
 ab duusari taraf shaike un bacchon ko bachaane ke liye panisher se prarthana karata hai, jinhen arab ke vyapaariyon ko beche jane kii sambhaavna he
 Now Punisher attacks Yakuza's businesses and also warns Yakuza of paying his price every day to keep the children imprisoned
 isse yakuja ko apni sampatti kaa baari nuksaan jhelana padataa hai
 Later Yakuza captures Punisher and Sheik and attempts to torture him and her
 lekin panisher aapane aap ko aaazaad kar letaa hai or vahaan se ek bas ke jariye bacchon ko lekar vahaan se bhaag jaataa hai
 But Tommy Franco survives, having already been taken to the Yakuza headquarters
 jab bacchon kii bas lod ho rahi he, to panisher ek police ke dwaara rodblock main chalaa jaataa he or pakadaa jaataa hai
 Now as the police were taking him to the car, Castle meets up with his old partner again and starts talking to him
 baad main ek mod par franko ke aadamiyon kaisal ko chhuda liya jaataa hai
 Now the men take Castle to Franco, where Franco prays to Laia Punisher to save his son, and he also blames himself for killing Castle's family
 ab kaisal apane puraane dushman ke saath milakar japani aapraadhik anderworld kaa america aadhaar band kar detaa hai
 Now Franco and Punisher go to Yakuza's headquarters, as they proceed to kill Aadi, including Lake Tanaka and his daughter, and eventually fight Yakuza, killing him as well
 apana betaa milane par, franco panisher ko bhi maarane kii koshish karata hai, lekin kaisal ne khud ko bachaa kar franco ko hi maar daalata hai
 Now Franco's son again threatens Panisher after killing his father
 lekin khud ko unhen chot pahunchane ke liye taiyaar nahin kar paata
 Now Castle understands Franco's son to "be a good boy, and grow up to be a good man" by not following his father's abuses
 uske baad ve vahaan se gaayab ho jate he
 Later the police comes there, but they find no trace of Punisher there
 is sab ke bich, kaisal darshakon ko ye bataata hai ki ve andhere main intjaar karenge or shahar main nyaay banaae rakhegein
