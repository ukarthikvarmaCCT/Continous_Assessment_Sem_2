 yah to he ki zyaadaatar pustaken vyapaarik pustaken hi hoti hai, phir bhi anya prakaar kii pustakon kaa prakaashan bhi jari he
 For example, books published by universities, books of science, etc
 mudran kii kala main parishkar kaa prabhaav bhi prakaashan vyavsaay par padaa
 Linotipes, cylindrical presses, rotary presses and the accompanying machines should have had an impact
 inamen se adhikansh kaa aavirbhaav 20ve sadi ke prarambh main hi hua tha
 Constant development in them made it easy to meet the demand of books
 20veen sadi main cinema, radio, televijan or motorcar, sachitr patr, patrikas tathaa manoranjan or gyanavardhan ke anya saadhan janata ke mastishk ko adhik ghere hue hai
 Everyone has fought the books but the continuous development of book publishing has not stopped
 utisi antar yaa savis antar kisi bhi sthaan ke maanak samay ke utisi se antar ko bolte hai
 For example, at any given moment, India's standard time is 5
5 hours ahead of the UTC of that time, so India's UTC difference is stated as +5: 30
 kuch deshon main garmiyon main har rose thodaa jaldi hone vaale prakaash kaa prayog rashtriya-str par urja bachane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 For this, the whole nation's clocks are put forward an hour between them by setting the initial and final dates fixed in each year
 is se puure desh kii dinacharya lagbhag ek ghante pehle shuru hoti he or ek ghante pehle khatm hoti he, yani raat ko battiyaan ityadi ek ghanta kam prayog hoti hai or urja kii bachat hoti he
 This method is called Diwalok Savings Time
 jin dinon main kisi sthaan par deebas chaalu ho vahaan utisi antar main +1:00 jod diya jaataa he
 Because of this, some places in the division can change their UTC difference for a few months in a year at any time
 bhura ek rang he
 It occurs in deep shades of red, orange and yellow
 yah rang ped ke tane ke rang se liya gaya he
 This color is similar to almond peel
 iskaa angreji naam baf he, jo ki bhens ke chamade se mila he
 The name is of an iron ash pigment
 tamra This color is derived from a metal called copper or copper
 bej Water culture or hydroponics is a technique in which crops are grown only with water and nutrients without planting in the field
 ise 'jaleey krishi' bhi kehete hai
 This technique of growing plants is quite right for the environment
 in paudhon ke liye kam pani kii jarurat hoti he, jisase pani kii bachat hoti he
 Pesticides also require very little use
 mitti main paidaa hone vaale paudhon tathaa is takanic se ugaae jane vaale paudhon kii paidaavaar main kaaphi antar hota he
 With this technique, five to seven kg of fodder is made from one kg of maize in ten days, it does not even have land
 is vidhi se hare chaare ke ugane ke liye sabase pehle makke ko 24 ghante ke liye pani main bhigona hota he
 Then put it in a tray and cover it with jute sacks
 teen dinon tak ise dhake rakhane par usamen ankuran ho jaataa he
 They then divide it into five trays
 har do-teen ghante main pani daalana hota he
 There is a hole in the tray, the more water the plants need, the more water stops
 yah takanic mehnat bhi bachaati he kyonki kheton main kaam karne ke liye kaaphi mehnat kii jarurat padati he, jabaki is takanic main zyada mehnat kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 In such a situation, the cost of crops is low and farmers get good profits
 hydroponic takanic se paudhon ko zyada oxygen mil jaati he or paudhe zyada tej gati se poshak tatwon ko sokhte hai
 Traditional green fodder contains 10
7 per cent protein while hydroponics green fodder contains 13
6 per cent protein
 tripitak Sutpitaka is a book of Buddhism
 yah granth tripitak ke teen bhaagon main se ek he
 Sutta Pitaka is a collection of principles of Lord Buddha in the form of arguments and dialogues
 inamen gadhy samvaad hai, muktak chand hai tathaa choti-choti pracheen kahaniyaan hai
 It is divided into five bodies or collections
 
 There are five parts of this Pitaka which are called nāyaka
 nikaay kaa arth he samooh
 Small and big sutas are stored in these five parts
 isiilie ve nikaay kehalaate hai
 The word "sangeeti" has also been used for the body
 aarambh main, jab ki tripitak lipibaddh nahin tha, bhikshu ek saath sutton kaa parayan karte the
 Accordingly, his five collections were called Sangeeti
 baad main nikaay shabd kaa adhik prachlan hua or sangeeti shabd kaa bahut kam
 Many threads have a bug
 ek hi sutt ke kai bhaan bhi hote hai
 8000 letters are bhanwar
 tadnusaar ek-ek nikaay kii akshar sankhya kaa bhi nirdhaaran ho saktaa he
 For example, there are 34 suttas of longing and 64 of bhanavars
 is prakaar saare dirghanikaay main 512000 akshar hai
 The sutas contain the teachings of certain disciples like God and Sariputra Maudgalyayan, Anand
 shishyon ke upadesh bhi bhagwaan dwaara anumodith hai
 Each Sutta has a role, which has a large historical view
 usamen in maton kaa ullekh he ki kab, kis sthaan par, kis vyakti yaa kin vyaktiyon ko vah upadesh diya gaya tha or shrotaaon par uskaa kya prabhaav padaa
 Most suttas are in prose, some in verse and some in prose-verse
 ek hi upadesh kai sutton main aayaa he- kahin sankshep main or kahin vistaar main
 They have a plurality of repetitions
 unke sankshipteekaran ke liye "payyal" kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 Is somewhat mature
 unamem kahin-kahin aakhyaanon or aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa bhi prayog kiya gaya he
 There is also a large stock of Sutpitaka similes
 kabhi-kabhi bhagwaan upamaaon ke sahare bhi upadesh dete the
 The audience ranged from king to color, naive farmer to great philosopher
 un sabake anuroop ye upmaayen jivan ke anek kshetron si lee gai hai
 Buddha biography, religion, philosophy, history, etc
 From all points of view, Sutpitaka is the most important part of Tripitaka
 buddhagaya ke bodhigamya ke neeche buddhatv kii prapti se lekar kushinagar main mahaparinirvana tak 45 varsh bhagwaan buddha ne jo lokseva kii, uskaa vivaran suttapitak main miltaa he
 Which Mahajanapadas he charika in the middle division, how they got mixed with people, how they paved the way from small problems to big problems, what they got in the promotion of their message Difficulties had to be faced- we get a description of all these things in Sutpitaka
 bhagwaan buddha ke jivan sambandhi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa varnan hi nahin; apitu unke mahaan shishyon kii jivan jhaankiyaan bhi isamen milti hai
 The greatest importance of suttapitaka lies in the means assigned by God
 vah sheel, samadhi or pragna rupi teen shikshaaon main nihit he
 The audience had people of many levels in terms of intelligence, moral and spiritual development
 un sabhi ke anuroop anek prakaar se unhone arya maarg kaa upadesh diya tha, jisamen panchasheel se lekar das parmitaayen tak shaamil hai
 The main religion synonyms are as follows - Four Arya Satya, Ashtangik Marg, Seven Bodhyangas, Four Samyak Pradhan Five senses, Pratitya Samutpada, Skandha Volume Metal Formed Sanskrit Religion Continuous sorrow-infinite-form Sanskrit traits
 inamen bhi santis ksheeya dharm hi bhagwaan ke upadeshon kaa saar he
 He wrote this in Mahaparinirvana Sutta
 yadi ham bhagwaan ke mahatvapurn upadeshon kii drushti se sutton kaa vishleshnatmak adhyayan karen to hamen unamem ghuma firaakar ye hi dharmaparyaay milenge
 The only difference is that they are brief and in some detail
 udaahranarth sutt nikaay ke praarambhik sutton main chaar satyon kaa ullekh maatr miltaa he, dhammachakkapavattan sutt main vistrut vivaran miltaa he or mahasatipatthan main inaki vishad vyakhya bhi milti he
 The main theme of Sutas is the religion and philosophy of Tathagata
 lekin prakarantar se or vishyon par bhi prakaash padataa he
 Other Shramana and Brahmin sects such as complex, parivrajaka, ajivak and nigantha which were prevalent at that time, have also been described in statutes
 ve sankhya main 62 bataae gaye hai
 There are many theories on Yajna and casteism
 desh magadh, koshal, vajji jaise kai rajyon main vibhajit tha
 Somewhere there was royalty rule and somewhere republican state
 unka aapas kaa sambandh kaisaa tha, shashan prashasan kaary kaise hote the- in baton kaa bhi ullekh kahin-kahin miltaa he
 The state of ordinary people, their way of living, ethics, food storage, industry, business, education, initiation, arts, knowledge, science, entertainment, sports etc
 have also been described
 gram, nigam, rajdhani, janapad, nadi, parvat, van, tadaag, maarg, ritu aadi bhugolic baton kii bhi charchaa kam nahin he
 Thus we see that the importance of Sutpitaka is not only in terms of religion and philosophy, but also in terms of political, social and geographical position of Buddha India
 in sutton main uplabdh saamagree kaa adhyayan karke vidwaanon ne niabandh likhakar anek pahaluon par prakaash daalaa he
 The five bodies of Sutpitaka are as follows: Deep body, Majjhim body, Samyutta body, Angusadva body and Khudka body

 sameekaran pratikon kii sahaayta se vyakt kiya gaya ek ganitiya kathan he jo do vastuon ko samaan athwa tulya bataata he
 It would not be an exaggeration to say that equations are the most important subject in modern mathematics
 aadhunik vigyaan evam takneekee main vibhinn ghatnaon evam prakriyaaon kaa ganitiya model banane main sameekaran hi aadharaka kaam karne hai
 The parity symbol is used to write the equation
 yatha- Equations are often used to show the equality of two or more expressions
 kisi sameekaran main ek yaa ek se adhik char raashi hoti hai
 The value of a variable amount for which both sides of the equation are equal is called the solution of the equation or the root of the equation
 aisa sameekaran jo char raashi ke sabhi maanon ke liye santusht hota he, use sarvasamika kehete hai
 like - ek sarvasamika he
 whereas ek sameekaran he jiskaa mul hai x = 0 { \ displaystyle x=0} evam x = 1 { \ displaystyle x=1} 
 If an equation is true, then sameekaran ke ek paksh main sthit koi char, achar, vyanjak aadi ko duusare paksh main le jane ko pakshaantar kaha jaataa he
 Difference is very important in solving equations
 pakshaantar karne kaa siddhanth upar varnit sameekaran ke gunon par hi aadhaarit he
 Depending on the nature of the variables contained in an equation, the equation can be classified as follows: vigyaan or takneekee main dizin yaa vishleshan karte samay praayah sameekaran praapt hote hai
 Their solution gives many useful information
 iske alaava aadhunik vigyaan evam takneekee main vibhinn ghatnaon evam prakriyaaon kaa ganitiya model banane main sameekaran hi aadhaar kaa kaam karne hai

 Muscle degeneration may be mild or severe
 samasyaayein kankaleey mansapeshi, yaa mansapeshi vikaar mastishk or anya ang pranaaliyon par prabhaav ke saath jud saktaa he
 Innumerable forms of congenital muscular dystrophy may be due to the absence of proteins that have been thought to have some relationship with the dystrophin – glycoprotein complex and the relationship between the muscle cells and the surrounding cellular structure
 janmajaat peshi apavikas ke kuch roopon main janmajaat licencesli or hydrosifaalas jaisi gambhir mastishk virupataayen dekhi gai hai

 Maharishi Swami Dayanand Saraswati was a great thinker, social reformer and patriot of modern India
 unka bachapan kaa naam 'mulshankar' tha
 He founded an Arya Samaj reformer organization - Arya Samaj in 1874
 ve ek sanyasi tathaa ek mahaan chintak the
 He always considered the power of the Vedas to be paramount
 swamiji ne karm siddhanth, punarjanm, brahmacharya tathaa sanyas ko apane darshan ke chaar stambh banaaya
 He first gave the slogan of 'swarajya' in 1876, which was later promoted by Lokmanya Tilak
 swami dayanand ke vichaaron se prabhavit mahapurushon kii sankhya asankhya he, inamen pramukh naam hai- maadaam bhikaaji kama, pandit lekharam arya, swami shraddhand, pandit gurudutt vidhyaarthee, shyaamaji krishna verma, vinayak damodar saavarkar, lala hardayal, madanlaal dhingra, ram prasad 'bismil', mahadev govind rande, mahatma hansraj, lala lajpat raay ityadi
 Among the prominent followers of Swami Dayanand, Lala Hansraj founded the 'dayanand Anglo Vedic College' at Lahore in 1886 and Swami Shraddhanand established the Gurukul at Kangri near Haridwar in 1901
 dayanand saraswati kaa janm 12 farvari tankaara main san 1824 main morabi ke paas kathiyawad kshetra, gujarat main hua tha
 His father's name was Karshanji Lalji Tiwari and mother's name was Yashodabai
 unke pita ek kar-colector hone ke saath brahman parivaar ke ek amir, samrudh or prabhaavshaalee vyakti the
 Dayanand Saraswati's real name was Moolshankar and his early life was very comfortable
 aage chalakar ek pandit banane ke liye ve sanskrit, veda, shastron va anya dharmik pustakon ke adhyayan main lag gaye
 There were many such incidents in his life which forced him to ask serious questions about the traditional beliefs of Hinduism and God
 ek baar shivaratri kii ghatana he
 Then they were only children
 shivaratri ke us din unka puraa parivaar raatri jaagran ke liye ek mandir main hi rukaa hua tha
 Even after the whole family went to sleep, he kept awake that Lord Shiva would come and receive the Prasad
 unhone dekha ki shivaji ke liye rakhe bhoga ko chuuhe kha rahe hai
 Seeing this, they were very surprised and started thinking that what God will not protect the offerings offered to him will protect humanity? He argued with his father and argued that we should not worship such a helpless God
 apni choti bahan or chachaa kii haije ke kaaran hui mrityu se ve jivan-maran ke arth par gaharaai se sochane lage or aise prashn karne lage jisase unke mata pita chintit rahane lage
 Then his parents decided to marry him at the beginning of adolescence (this was common practice)
 lekin balak mulshankar ne nishchay kiya ki vivaah unke liye nahin bana he or ve 1846 main satya kii khoj main nikal pade
 Maharishi Dayanand has a high sense of idealism in his heart, a natural tendency to take a realistic path, an indomitable zeal to redesign the destiny of the motherland, a keen desire to contemplate religious-socio-economic and political terms and a glorious past among the Aryavarites
 There was a feeling of loyalty
 unhone kisi ke virodh tathaa ninda karne kii parvaah kiye bina aryaavart ke hindu samaaj kaa kayakalp karnaa apana dhyey bana liya tha
 On the day of Shivaratri in Phalgun Krishna Samvat 1895, his life took a new turn
 unhen nayaa bodh hua
 He left the house and while traveling he reached Guru Virjanand
 guruvar ne unhen panini vyakaran, paatanjal-yogasutra tathaa veda-vedang kaa adhyayan karaayaa
 In Guru Dakshina, he sought - show success by learning, doing charity, salvation of the true scriptures, do not eradicate the ignorance of dissenters, remove the darkness of ignorance from the light of Vedas, radiate the light of Vedic religion everywhere
 yahi tumhaari gurudakshina he
 He blessed that God would make his efforts successful
 unhone antim shiksha di -manushyakrut granthon main ishwar or rishiyon kii ninda he, rishikrut granthon main nahin
 Vedas are proof
 is kasuti ko haath se na chhodana
 Maharishi Dayanand traveled to many places
 unhone haridwar main kumbh ke avasar par 'pakhand khandini pataakaa' fahraai
 He did many lectures
 ve kalakatta main babu keshavachandra sen tathaa devendra nath thakur ke sampark main aae
 It is from here that he started wearing full clothes and speaking and writing in Hindi
 yaheen unhone tatkaaleen visarai ko kaha tha, main chahta hum videshiyon kaa rajya bhi purna sukhadaayak nahin he
 But it is very difficult to get rid of different language, different education, different behavior
 bina iske chute paraspar kaa vyavhaar puraa upkaar or abhipraay siddh hona kathin he
 Maharishi Dayanand established the Aryasamaj at Chaitra Shukla Pratipada Samvat in 1932 in Girgaum Mumbai
 aryasamaj ke niyam or siddhant pranimaatr ke kalyaan ke liye he
 To benefit the world is the main objective of this society, that is, physical, spiritual and social progress
 main maanata hoon ki gita main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Also the Gita is not against the Vedas
 vedon ko chhod kar koi anya dharmagranth pramaan nahin he - is satya kaa prachaar karne ke liye swami ji ne saare desh kaa daura karnaa prarambh kiya or jahaan-jahaan ve gayi pracheen parampara ke pandit or vidwaan unase haar maanate gayi
 He had extensive knowledge of Sanskrit language
 sanskrit main ve dharapravaah bolte the
 At the same time, they were very logical
 unhone isai or muslim dharmagranthon kaa bhalee-bhaanti adhyayan-manthan kiya tha
 So alone they started a struggle on three fronts
 do morche to isiyat or islam ke the kintu teesraa morcha sanatandharmee hinduon kaa tha, jinase jujhane main swami ji ko anek apmaan, kalank or ksht jhelane pade
 There was no response to the torch lit by Dayanand
 ve jo kuch kah rahe the, uskaa uttar na to musalmaan de sakate the, na isai, na puraanon par palane vaale hindu pandit or vidwaan
 Hindu Navothan had now come into full light and many sensible people started to feel in their mind that in fact there is no essence in the Pongapanthi of mythological religion
 swamiji prachlit dharmon main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa kadaa khandan karte the chaahe vah sanathan dharm ho yaa islam ho yaa isai dharm ho
 In his Mahagranth Satyarth Prakash, Swamiji has denied the evils prevailing in all opinions
 unke samakaleen sudhaarkon se alag, swamiji kaa mat shikshit varg tak hi simit nahin tha apitu arya samaaj ne aryaavart ke saadhaaran janamanas ko bhi apni ore aakarshith kiya
 In 1872, Swamiji came to Calcutta
 vahaan devendranath thakur or keshavachandra sen ne unka bada satkar kiya
 He also had discussions with Brahmo Samajis, but Brahmo Samaj scholars influenced by Christianity could not agree with Swami regarding the rebirth and authenticity of Veda
 kehete hai kalkatte main hi keshavachandra sen ne swami ji ko yah salaah de daali ki yadi aap sanskrit chhod kar aryabhasha main bolnaa armbh karen, to desh kaa aseem upkaar ho saktaa he
 Since then, the language of Swami Ji's lectures became Aryabhasha and he started to have a lot of followers in the Aryan speaking provinces
 kalkatte se swami ji mumbai padhaare or vahiin 10 april 1875 i
 ko unhone 'arya samaaj' kii sthapana kii
 Prayer community also discussed with him in Mumbai
 kintu yah samaaj to brahmo samaaj kaa hi mumbai sanskaran tha
 Therefore, even the people of this society could not agree with Swami ji
 mumbai se laut kar swami ji indraprastha aae
 There he called a meeting of Christian, Muslim and Hindu priests for Satyansandha
 kintu do dinon ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bhi log kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake
 Swamiji went to Punjab from Indraprastha
 punjab main unke prati bahut utsaah jaagrath hua or saare praant main aryasamaj kii shakhaaen khulne lageen
 Since then, Punjab has been the principal stronghold of the Arya Samajis
 maharishi dayanand ne tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt saamaajik kuritiyon tathaa andhvishwaason or rudhiyon-buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye, nirbhay hokar un par akraman kiya
 They were called 'saints warriors'
 unhone janmana jati kaa virodh kiya tathaa karm ke aadhaar vedanukool varna-nirdhaaran kii baat kahi
 He was a supporter of Dalits
 unhone striyon kii shiksha ke liye prabal aandolan chalaaya
 He prohibited child marriage and sati and supported widow marriage
 unhone ishwar ko sristi kaa nimitt kaaran tathaa prakruti ko anadi tathaa shaashvat mana
 He was an advocate of oilism
 unke darshanik vichaar vedanukool the
 He also believed that the living beings are free to work and are free to enjoy the fruits
 maharishi dayanand sabhi dharmanuayiyon ko ek manch par laakar ekta sthapit karne ke liye prayatnsheel the
 He made such an effort in 1878 during the Indraprastha court
 unke amar granth satyarth prakaash, sanskaar vidhi or rigvedadi bhashya bhoomika main unke moulik vichaar suspasht rup main prapya hai
 He was a yogi and had special emphasis on pranayama
 ve saamaajik punargathan main sabhi varnon tathaa striyon kii bhagidaari ke pakshdhar the
 In the direction of national awakening, he adopted the path of social revolution and spiritual revival
 unki shiksha sambandhi dharanaon main pradarshit doordarshita, deshbhakti tathaa vyavhaarikta purnataya praasangik tathaa uganukool he
 Maharishi Dayanand was not only a social reformer and a pioneer of religious renaissance, he was also a great nationalist and political idealist
 videshiyon ke aryaavart main rajya hone ke kaaran aapas kii foot, matbhed, brahmacharya kaa seven na karnaa, vidhaan padhnaa-padhaana va baalyavastha main aswayamvaravivaah, vishayasakti, mithyaa bhashaavadi, kulakshan, veda-vidya kaa prachaar aadi kukarm hai, jab aapas main bhai-bhai ladte hai or tabhi teesraa videshi aakar panch ban baithta he
 He has also enumerated the qualifications required for the head of state and various councils and committees of government
 unhone nyaay kii vyavastha rishi pranit granthon ke aadhaar par kiye jane kaa paksh liya
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati is generally known only as the founder and social reformer of the Arya Samaj
 rashtriya swatantrata ke liye kiye gaye prayatnon main unki ullekhneey bhoomika kii jaankaree bahut kam logon ko he
 The fact is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had probably first dared to say that "aryavarta belongs to Aryavartis" in the subordinated Aryavarta
 hamaare pratham swatantrata samar, san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn yojana bhi swami ji ke netritv main hi taiyaar kii gai thi or vahi uske pramukh sutaradhar bhi the
 He often preached nationalism to the audience in his sermons and filled the spirit of dying for the country
 1855 main haridwar main jab kumbh mela laga tha to usamen shaamil hone ke liye swami ji ne abu parvat se haridwar tak paidal yatra kii thi
 On the way, he preached from place to place and explored the pulse of the countrymen
 unhone yah anubhav kiya ki log ab angrejon ke atyaachaari shashan se tang aa chuke hai or desh kii swatantrata ke liye sangharsh karne ko aatur ho uthe hai
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati reached Haridwar and camped in a solitary place on a hill there
 vahiin par unhone paanch aise vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii, jo aage chalakar san 1857 kii kranti ke karnadhaar bane
 These five persons were Nana Saheb, Azimullah Khan, Bala Saheb, Tatya Tope and Babu Kunwar Singh
 baatcheet kaaphi lambi chali or yaheen par yah tay kiya gaya ki firangi sarkaar ke viruddh sampoorn desh main sashastr kranti ke liye aadharbhumi taiyaar kii jaae or uske baad ek nishchit din sampoorn desh main ek saath kranti kaa bigul baja diya jaae
 a plan of 'roti Aur Kamal' was also prepared to spread the voice of this revolution among the general public and Aryavartiya soldiers
 is sampoorn vichaar vimarsh main pramukh bhoomika swami dayanand saraswati kii hi thi
 After discussion and planning, Swamiji stopped in Haridwar and the other five national leaders went to their respective places to give realization to the plan
 unke jane ke baad swami ji ne apane kuch vishwast sadhu sanyasiyon se sampark sthapit kiya or unka ek gupt sanghathan banaaya
 The headquarters of this organization was built at the Yogmaya temple at Mehrauli in Indraprastha
 is mukhyalay ne swadhinata samar main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai
 Under the leadership of Swamiji, sadhus also awakened the revolution throughout the country
 ve krantikariyon ke sandesh ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaate, unhen protsaahit karte or aavashyaktaa padane par swayan bhi hathiyaar uthaakar angrejon se sangharsh karte
 During the entire period of the revolution of 1857, the national leader, Swami Dayanand Saraswati remained in constant contact
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa par bhi swami ji niraash nahin the
 He was already aware of the fact that freedom cannot be attained only by trying once
 iske liye to sangharsh kii lambi prakriya chalaani hogi
 At the 1855 meeting in Haridwar itself, when Babu Kunwar Singh asked Swamiji about the possibility of success in this struggle, his answer was "the freedom struggle never fails
" bharat dhire-dhire ek sau varsh main paratantra bana he
 Now it will take one hundred years to become independent as well
 is swatantrata prapti main bahut se anmol praanon kii aahutiyaan daali jaaengi
 "how accurate Swami Ji's prediction turned out to be, was confirmed by subsequent events
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa ke baad jab tathya tope, naanaa sahab tathaa anya rashtriya netaa swami ji se mili to unhen bhi unhone niraash na hone tathaa uchit samay kii pratiksha karne kii hi salaah di
 Two years after the revolution of 1857, Swamiji made Swami Virjanand his guru and took initiation from him
 swami virajanand ke ashram main rahakar unhone vedon kaa adhyayan kiya, un par chintan kiya or uske baad apane guru ke nirdeshaanusaar ve vaidic gyaan ke prachaar-prasar main jute gaye
 To achieve this objective, he also founded the Arya Samaj and through it did many works of social improvement
 chuaachhut, sati pratha, bal vivaah, nar bali, dharmik sankeernata tathaa andhvishwaason ke viruddh unhone jamkar prachaar kiya or vidhwaa vivaah, dharmik udaartaa tathaa aapasi bhaichaare kaa unhone samarthan kiya
 Along with all this, Swamiji never failed to fill the spirit of patriotism among the people
 prarambh main anek vyaktiyon ne swami ji ke samaaj sudhaar ke kaaryon main vibhinn prakaar ke vighn daale or unka virodh kiya
 Gradually, his arguments began to be understood by the people and the protest was reduced
 unki lokapriyata nirantar badhane lagi
 This led to a desire in the minds of British officials that if they were made in favor of the British Government, then through them, the British could be popularized in the general public
 isse purv angrej adhikari isi prakaar se anya kuch dharmopadeshkon tathaa dharmadhikariyon ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan dekar apni taraf mila chuke the
 He also considered Swami Dayanand Saraswati like him
 tadnusaar ek isai padri ke madhyam se swami ji kii tatkaaleen governor general lord northbrook se mulaakaat karavaayi gai
 The meeting took place in Calcutta in March 1873
 idhar-udhar kii kuch aupchaarik baton ke uparant lord northbrook ne vinamrata se apni baat swami ji ke saamne rakhi- "apane vyaakhyaan ke prarambh main aap jo ishwar kii prarthana karte hai, kya usamen aap angreji sarkaar ke kalyaan kii bhi prarthana kar sakenge
 " garvanar general kii baat sunakar swami ji sahaj hi sab kuch samaj gaye
 He also felt pity for the intelligence of the British government, which could not understand him properly
 unhone nirbhikta or dridhtaa se governor general ko uttar diya- The Governor General did not expect such a sharp reply from Swamiji
 mulaakaat tatkaal samaapt kar di gai or swami ji vahaan se laut aae
 After this, the intelligence department of the government had a keen eye on Swami ji and his organization Arya Samaj
 unki prayek gatividhi or unke dwaara bole gaye prayek shabd kaa ricard rakhaa jane laga
 Due to their impact on the general public, the government began to realize that this rebel Fakir and Arya Samaj can become a threat to the government any day
 isliye swami ji ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi tarah-tarah ke shadyantr rache jane lage
 The circumstances under which Swamiji died, give the same impression that there was definitely a conspiracy of the English government in it
 swami ji kii mrityu 30 oktober 1883 ko deepawali ke din sandhyaa ke samay hui thi
 In those days, he had gone to Jodhpur at the invitation of King Naresh Jaswant Singh
 vahaan unke nity hi pravachan hote the
 Sometimes Maharaja Jaswant Singh would also sit at his feet and listen to his sermons there
 do-chaar baar swami ji bhi rajya mehalon main gaye
 There he saw the unnecessary intervention of a prostitute named Nanhi and his immense influence on Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 swami ji ko yah bahut bura laga
 When he explained this to Maharaj, he politely accepted his word and broke the relationship with the little one
 isse nanheen swami ji ke bahut adhik viruddh ho gai
 He got Swami ji's cook Kalia alias Jagannath on his side and got the glass mixed in his milk
 thodi hi der baad swami ji ke paas aakar apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya or uske liye kshamaa maangi
 The benevolent-hearted Swami Ji gave him five hundred rupees for his living and living, so that the police would not disturb him
 baad main jab swami ji ko jodhpur ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya to vahaan sambandhit chikitsak bhi shaq ke daayre main rahaa
 He was accused of giving light poison to Swamiji in the name of medicine
 baad main jab swami ji kii tabiyat bahut kharaab hone lagi to unhen ajmer ke aspataal main laayaa gaya
 But by then there was a lot of delay
 swami ji ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 The apprehension in this entire incident is that the task of raising the prostitute and tricking the doctor was done by a British officer at the behest of the British government
 anyathaa ek saadhaaran veshya ke liye yah sambhav nahin tha ki keval apane balboote par swami dayanand saraswati jaise suprasiddh or lokapriy vyakti ke viruddh aisa shadyantr kar sake
 Without such encouragement and protection, even the doctor could not do this audacity
 swadharm, swabhaasha, swarashtra, swasamskruti or swadeshonnati ke agradoot swami dayanand ji kaa sharir san 1883 main deepawali ke din panchtatv main villin ho gaya or ve apane peeche chhod gaye ek siddhanth, krinvanto vishwamaryam - arthath saare sansar ko shreshth maanav banaao
 His last words were - "lord! You did well
 aapaki ichha purna ho
 " swami dayanand saraswati ne kai dharmik va saamaajik pustaken apni jivan kaal main likhin
 The early books were in Sanskrit, but over time he also wrote many books in Aryabhasa, because Aryabhasa had more reach than Sanskrit
 hindi ko unhone 'aryabhasha' kaa naam diya tha
 Swami Dayanand was the pioneer and early man who used the Aryabhasha for better writing
 swami dayanand saraswati kii mukhya kritiyaan nimnlikhit hai- In 1873, a book called Aryodeshyaratnamala was published in which Swamiji described the definition of one hundred words
 inamen se kai shabd aam bolchaal main aate hai par unke arth rutes ho gaye hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ishwar, dharm, karm, aadi
 They are defined and explained in this book
 is laghu pustika main 8 prishth hai
 In 1881, Swami Dayanand published a book called Gokrunanidhi which also takes credit for playing a major role in establishing the Goraksha movement
 is pustak main unhone sabhi samudaay ke logon ko apane pratinidhi sahit gokrishyaadi raksha samiti kii sadsyta lene ko kaha he jiskaa uddeshy pashu va krishi kii raksha he
 Like modern environmentalists, ideas have been made here
 is pustak main samiksha, niyam va upanium hai, tathaa pramukhtah pashuon ko na maar kar unka paalan karne main hone vaale laabh varnit kiye gaye hai
 The book Behavnabhanu was published in 1880 by the Vedic machinery, Banaras
 isamen dharmokt or uchit vyavhaar ke bare main varnan he
 On 27 February 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati in Udaipur published an acknowledgment in which he handed over the responsibility of philanthropy to 23 persons after his death, who could then carry on their work
 inamen mahadev govind rande kaa bhi naam he
 This acknowledgment is signed as a witness to 13 dignitaries
 iske prakaashan ke kuch chah maah pashchaat hi unka dehant ho gaya tha

 henry yaa wiliam sidney porter prasiddh american lekhak the
 He was born on September 11, 1862 in Greensboro, North Carolina and died on June 5, 1910 in New York
 pichley varshon main vah apana bich kaa naam 'sidney' hi likhaa karte the
 He left school at the age of sixteen, but his acuity to read and write was not lost
 bachapan main unhone greensbaro kii ek dawaaiyon kii dukaan main kaam kiya tha, jahaan ab tak uski jainti manaayi jaati he
 At the age of nineteen, he went to live in the area of texas to improve his health
 vahaan usne ghudsawaari sikh lee or junglee, adiyal ghodo ko bhi vash main karne laga
 Then he got a job in a farm office in Austin
 aapane aas-paas ke chitramay jivan kii jin vastuon kaa bhi use parichay hua, ve sab kii sab uski kahaniyon main chhan aayin
 This is the reason why his stories occur mostly in pasture territories, Central America or New York
 shahari jivan kii kahaniyon main jinke liye vah prasiddh he, jivan kii vidmbanaaon kisvikrati hai
 They are a reflection of their own bitter experiences
 apane pandraa varsh ke jis texas pravaas main unhone vivaah kiya or ek putree ke pita bane, usee main khedjanak ghataanaon ne unki umango ko dhank liya
 He got the job of counting the notes in a bank, but within a few days he came to know of a mess of a few thousand dollars in his account, he also missed the job
 aansa lagata he ki uske maalik use sajaa dilaanaa nahin chaahate the, isliye vah bina roak-tok, lagbhag ek varsh tak huston shahar ke ek akhbaar main kaam karata rahaa
 Then, perhaps he moved to New Orleans to avoid arrest, from where he took tickets for Tojillo and Honduras
 'cabejas and kings' naamak uski sarvapratham pustak main varnit, saahas or jeevat kii sari kahaniyon kaa ghatnasthal yaheen se mila he
 His wife's illness called him back to Austin
 unke lautate hi vah mar gayi
 Then he was tried and convicted for the crime of Khayanat
 wiliam porter, teen varsh or teen maheenon tak jail main rahe
 He was an ardent prisoner with an enthusiastic conviction
 lekin uske jivan par is kaal kii kaali chaaya hameshaa dikhaai padati rahi
 It was here that he developed compassion for the poor and this led to many of his best stories, out of which a play called 'alias jimmy Ballantine', based on the story 'heart Transformation', proved to be the best drama of the time
 jail casipaahiyon ke oran henry naamak captain ne hi uske upnaam ko khoj nikaala gaya he
 Porter thought that 'O Henry' was enough to sign
 unhone jab likhnaa shuru kiya to sampadakon se apana naam gupt rakhane kii bhi prarthana kii
 In New York, O
 Henry lived in the rooms of the neighborhoods of Madison Square and Irving Place and struggled fiercely to pay rent, earning money from his stories
 rabart ech0 davis, bartlet maaris, irvin es0 kaab aadi mitron ne or duusare kai likhkon or sampadakon ne unke kamaron kaa varnan kiya he
 They lived in an outside room
 jisaki khidkiyaan farsh tak faili hui thim,
 Sitting here, he would stare at the passersby and weave around them a net of creatures
 unhone ashaavadi, ekanki saamaanya vyaktiyon ko apni kahaniyon ke paatr bananaa shuru kiya
 Imagined girls who roam the cities to find business and love; Those young men who seek more advantages than others and drunken and unworthy men, who also suffer misfortune with arrogance and sometimes display sentimentality like the characters of the stories, become the storyline
 yadi kathavstu dukhaant hui to o0 henry usamen sthaneey boliyon kaa namak-mirch laga detaa
 No incident was so dull for him in which he could not shine
 thik isi jagah aakar usne us charam bindu yaa mode kaa avishkaar kiya, jisase uski anek kahaniyon kaa ant apratyaashit banane laga
 This is evident in short stories such as "decorated room," "roof room" and "spring menu", some larger stories also show this element
 america ke shrotao me, puraane jamaane ke aag ke chaaro ore baithkar kahaniyaan sunne ke yug se, is prakaar ke kisson ke prati vishesh lagaav rahaa he
 The stories of O
 Henry seem to be elaborate replicas of these traditional stories
 kathanak ke to vah jaadugar the or ansi-ansi kalpanarmya paristhitiyaan nirmaan karane main vah siddhhast the, jahaan uske paatr jeevanajite nahin balki usase khilwaad karte prathit hote he
 It was his intention to entertain the readers and to get his curiosity awakened, he has done various types of slapstick by his students
 ve romance ke bhukhe, bure vakt kaa himmat se muqabla karne vaale, kuleenata kaa dhong karne vaale or aadhunik 'alif-laila' kii rangeen duniya main vicharne vaale chitrit kiye gayi hai
 He has hardly done any detailed and sagopang analysis of man
 unhone to manushya kaa, aadhunik shahari jivan ke bhavar main fase hue, asahaay vyakti ke rup main hi, darshan karaayaa
 Nansi of the 'sneh Deep' story simply refuses to accept a shopkeeper as a girl because she works in a shop and says, "there is no such thing
" aaj ke bhrasht samaaj ko kism khojane kii aadat pad gayi he
 "he may have depicted a man so fallen that he is not even ashamed of his weaknesses
 uski sab kahaniyon ke neeche sahrudayta or sahanubhuti kii anterdhara bah rahi he
 He was always ready to give a place in the wider family of humanity to every ill-fated or backward person in life
 kabhi-kabhi ve uskaa manoranjan karte hai, kabhipane jivan kii vidmbanaaon se use dukhi kar dete he or kabhi vah bhavuk bhi ho uthta ahi parantu har haalat main, vah bhagya kii har chhedchhad ko sweekaar kar letehai or uske khalanaayak bhi haasyaaspad hi ho pate hai- dusht nahin
 O
 Henry's art flourished in his second book, The Four Million, which also gained him much popularity
 pratham baar prakashit hone ke chalis varsh baad, uski 'uphaar' naamak kahani kaa chalchitr bana
 Many compilations of his other stories were published such as 'sneh Deep', 'spirit of the West', 'voice of the City', 'bhagyachakra', 'choices', 'dhandhe Ki Baat', 'life Cycle'
 uski mratyu ke baad teen kitaaben or chhapin- 'safedposh thag', 'aawaara' or 'bhuule-bhatke'
 The stories of O
 Henry remained very famous during his lifetime, and it can be said that he tried to get into the depths of the heart, expressing displeasure with the vow of human nature in both his creations and his ideology
 vah manushya ke sachche rup ko chhipaane vaale, roodhi or vishwaas ke har parde ko cheer kar satya ke darshan karana chaahate the
 He used to say that the true feeling of truth can only be in the narrative
 apane nijee anubhav se is nishkarsh par pahunch kar, o0 henry ne vidwaanon ke is vishwaas ko fir se sthapit kar diya ki aitihaasik tathy kii apeksha, kalpana hi soundarya kaa adhik prabhaavshaalee avishkaar karti he
 Storytelling was also being changed by professional storytellers
 manushya ke bartaav ko prabhavit karne vaale har hetu ke mul, maansik or shaareerik kamiyon main dhunde jane lage the or vyakti ke jivan par saamaajik prabhaavon kaa moolyankan kiya jane laga tha
 If o had survived, where would Henry have reached- it is difficult to say, but his contribution would have been considerable
 aaj o0 henry kii kahaniyaan, uske yug ke pratik ke rup main hi padhi jaati he
 Just as the stories of Bret Hart revive the mine workers, gamblers and contractors of the western frontier, the stories of O
 Henry set the world around 1900
 jab usne ghudsavaaron kaa majaak udaaya, tab spain kii ladaai ke ghudsavaaron kii yaad jaataa thi
 Americans find the small states of Central America as bizarre as the Achuria described in its story! He was self-conscious and reticent by nature
 apane kuch ghanisht mitron- jo mukhyat: akhabaaron ke sampadak the- kii sohabat or jaraa si sharaab use priy thi
 He always had a shortage of time, because his stories were very short and everything he would get in his change would immediately end
 sampadakon kii nirantar maang ke neeche vah pisataa rahaa
 For him, life was a chaotic business, in which the manner of award was very cynical
 fir bhi usne, is vyavhaar hi har ghup-chhaanv kaa swaagat muskaara kar kiya
 Luck and coincidence play an important part in his stories
 du:kha or pidaa bhi paryaapt maatra main he, parantu kadavaahat kahin nahin ghusane paayi he
 By the time she was finished at the young age of 47, her best works might not have been written by then, but what she wrote will remain indelible in her narrative and some of her stories will remain immortal
 endoscope kaa arth he andar dekhnaa, or khaastaur par iskaa arth hota he chikitsiya kaaran se endoscope kii madad se sharir ke andar dekhnaa
 The endoscope is a device that is used to examine inside the hollow organs or perforations of the body
 anya chikitsiya chithran upkarnon ke vipareet endoscope ko sidhe hi sharir ke ang main daalaa jaataa he
 Endoscopy may also refer to the use of borescopes in technical situations in which direct line-of-sight observation is not practical
 ek endoscope nimnlikhit ghatakon se milakar bana ho saktaa he: Endoscopy may include: pehle endoscope kaa avishkaar, 1806 main philip bojini dwaara maanav sharir kii naliyon or garton kii jaanch ke liye unke dwaara prastut kiye gayi "lichatlitre " ke vikaas ke saath hua tha
 However the Vienna Medical Society disapproved of such curiosity
 1822 main maikinek island, michigan ke ek sainya shalya-chikitsak wiliam bumont dwaara pehla endoscope viksit kiya gaya
 The first major step towards improving endoscopy was the use of electric light in it
 aise shuruaati prakaash strot bahari the
 Later small bulbs became available that made it possible to obtain internal light, for example in a hysteroscope developed by Charles David in 1908
 hence chrishchiyan jacobiyas ko leparoscopy or thoracoscopy kii madad se amashay tathaa seene kii aarambhik endoscopy khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 Laparoscopy was used by Heinz Cock in the 1930s to diagnose liver and gall bladder
 1937 main hope ne actopic pregnancy kaa nidaan karne main leparoscopy ke istemaal kii jaankaree di
 In 1944, Roller Palmer placed his patients in the Trendelenburg position after gastric distention of the stomach and was thus able to reliably perform gynecologic laparoscopy
 karl stores ne ianti visheshgyon ke liye 1945 main upkaran banane shuru kiye
 His intention was to develop such a device with the help of which doctors could be able to see inside the human body
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke ant main uplabdh takanic ab bhi bahut hi saadhaaran thi
 The area under examination of the inner part of the human body was illuminated by the Miniature Electric Lamp
 is baat ke prayaas kiye gaye ki endoscopy tub ke jariye bahari strot se sharir ke andar prakaash ko paravartit kiya ja sake
 Karl Storge adopted a plan: he tried to put very bright, but cool, light through the device into the body, to get the best visibility inside the body, as well as to provide objective documentation through image transmission
 aane vaale samay ke liye maardarshak ke rup main apane 400 se adhik rogiyon or kaaryaksham namoonay ke saath karl stores ne endoscopy ke vikaas kii disha main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 However, it was Harold Hopkins who, along with his engineering talent and vision, eventually created a revolution in the field of medical optics through the work of an optical designer
 gastroscope ko pehali baar 1952 main ek japani doctor or optical ejiniyaron kii team dwaara viksit kiya gaya
 Mutsuo Sugiura, under the joint auspices of Olympus Corporation, worked with Doctor Tatsuro Yuji and his colleague Shoji Fukami to develop a device they had previously dubbed the "gastro Camera"
 isamen ek nanha-sa camera ek lacheele tip par lite balb ke saath judaa hua tha
 With this help, he was able to take pictures of stomach ulcers and detect stomach cancer in the initial stage, which were not caught by X-rays
 1950 ke dashak kii shuruaati daur main harold hopkins ne ek “fibroscope” kaa nirmaan kiya, jo chikitsa or udyog, donon hi kshetron main upyogi sabit hua
 Subsequent research and development on these fibers led to further improvement in picture quality
 aane vaale dinon main nae vikaas ke antargat shaamil hue ek shaktishaalee bahya strot se vastu ke chor tak prakaash ke pahunchane ke liye atirikt fibron kaa istemaal – jisase ucchstareey purna varnakram chamak kii prapti sambhav hui, jisaki aavashyaktaa chitra kii baarikiyon ko dekhne or rangeen photography ke liye hoti he
 This capability evolved with developments in the optical field, in which it was possible to "operate" the tip by the controls placed in the hands of the endoscopist, as well as to remotely operate the surgical instrument inside the endoscope
 Also new facilities were acquired
 yah us shalya-chikitsa kii shuruyaat thi, jise ham aaj kii-hole surgery ke naam se jaanate hai
 Fernando Elves Martins of Portugal invented the first fiber optics endoscope
 haalanki, fibroscope kii chitra gunvattta kii bhautik simaaen thim
 In modern terminology, a bundle of 50,000 fibers effectively gives a picture of only 50,000 pixels, apart from this the fiber changes due to frequent changes in usage and thus gradually reduces pixels
 antat itani kshati ho jaati he ki samooche bandal ko badalane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Hopkins felt that any next optical correction would require a different method
 purv ke sakht endoscope main kaaphi kam lite transmittence tathaa kamjor image quality kii samasya thi
 There was no specific scope for imaging optics due to the need for surgical tools for surgical operations and the need for the illumination system to pass through the endoscope tube
 paaramparik pranali ke chote lens ko sahaayak ring kii jarurat thi, jo lens ke ek bade bhaag ko adhigrahit karata tha; jinhen nirmit karnaa or ek saath rakhana kaaphi kathin tha, saath hi optical rup se ve naakaam bhi the
 The sophisticated diagnosis that Hopkins presented was to fill the space between the 'little lens' with a glass rod
 ye thik-thik endoscope tub main feet ho jate the, jisase ve swa-sanrekhi ban gaye tathaa unhen ‘little lens’ ko puri tarah se vitarit karne ke liye kisi samarthan kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahi
 The rod-lens was easy to operate and use and used the maximum available diameter
 sahi vakrata, rod ke siron par coating tathaa kaanch ke prakaar ke adhiktam vikalpon, jo hopkins dwaara aanklit tathaa ullekith the, ke saath chitra kii gunvattta ko 1 mimi vyas vaali nalee main roopantarit kar diya gaya
 With such a small diameter high quality 'telescope' the tool and illuminance system could easily be placed inside an outer tube
 ek baar phir karl stores ne hi do vyaktiyon ke bich ke lambey rachanaatmak sahyog ke rup main pehle-pahal in nae endoscopon kaa nirmaan kiya
 Although there are certain areas of the body that will forever require flexible endoscopes, hard rod-lens endoscopes have such exceptional performance that they are still a favorite instrument in modern times, and indeed modern key-hole surgery

 Due to the use of sedative, most hospitals instruct patients to go home with another person and instruct them not to drive the vehicle themselves and handle other machinery on that day

 iesao code: cdj An igloo or igluit) or snowhouse, is a shelter made of ice, originally built by the Inuit
 kisi bhi saamagree se bane makaan yaa ghar ke liye inuit main iglu shabd istemaal kiya jaataa he, or yah keval barf ke gharon tak hi simit nahin he, balki isamen paaramparik tambu, sod grih, bahakar ai lakadiyon se bane ghar or aadhunik imaaraten shaamil he
 However, outside of Inuit society, the "igloo" refers specifically to a shelter built by frozen ice blocks, usually of a dome shape
 haalanki iglu, aam taur par sabhi inuit ke saath judaa hua he, yah mukhyatah canada ke madhya arctic or greenland ke thule kshetra ke logon dwaara nirmit kiya jaataa tha
 Other Inuit people used ice for the purpose of securing their homes made of veal bones and skins
 barf kaa prayog isliye kiya jaataa he kyonki unamem dabi hui hawa kii theliyaan use ek visanvahak banaati he
 The outside temperature can be as low as -45 ° C, but only when heated by physical heat alone, the inside temperature can be between -7 ° c to 16 ° C
 iglu teen paramparaagat prakaar ke hote hai, sabhi vibhinn aakaaron ke hote hai or vibhinn prayojanon ke liye upyog kiye jate hai
 The ice used to make an igloo must have sufficient structural strength so that it can be properly cut and placed one at a time
 is prayojan ke liye istemaal kiye jane ke liye aisi him upyukt hoti he jo hawa se udayi gai ho or jo barf ke tukdon ko saghan banaati he or jodatii he
 The holes left in the ice from where the sections are cut are commonly used as the lower half of the shelter
 kabhi-kabhi, pravesh dwaar par ek choti surang kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he taaki jab daravaaza band ho to hawa or taap kii haani ko kam kiya ja sake
 Due to the excellent insulating properties of ice, inhabited igloos are surprisingly comfortable and warm inside
 kuch maamalon main, barf ke ek khand ko daalaa jaataa he taaki iglu main prakaash aa sake
 Depending on the architecture, the igloo is unique in the sense that it is a dome that is constructed from independent blocks that are bent over each other and is polished to fit without any additional structures during construction
 
 yadi sahi dhang se ek iglu kaa nirmaan kiya jaae to vah chat par khadey ek vyakti ke baraabar vajan kaa samarthan kar saktaa he
 Also, in a traditional Inuit igloo, the heat produced by the Kudlik causes its inner body to melt slightly
 yah pighalanaa or punah jamana, ek barf kii chadar kaa nirmaan karata he or iglu ko majboot banane main yogadan karata he
 The sleeping platform is a raised area
 kyonki garm hawa upar uthati he or thandi hawa sthir ho jaati he, pravesh dwaar ek thande trep kii tarah kaam karti he, jabaki sone vaala kshetra stove, chiraag yaa sharir dwaara jitani bhi garmi utpann hoti he use pakad kar rakhti he
 Central Inuit, especially those living around the Davis Strait, cover the residential area with a layer of foreskin, with a temperature of about 2 ° c inside
 From 10–20 ° c Increases 1922 ke vruttchitr nanuk of di north main iglu banaate hue ek inuit ke sabase pracheen filmi drishy dikhaae gaye hai
 In the film, Nanuk, whose real name was Alakaryalak, makes an igloo for a large family as well as a small igloo for sled puppies
 nanuk, ek hathidanth chaaku se barf ke khandon ko kaatane or chhaantane ke istemaal ko pradarshit karata he or saath hi saath khidki banane main saafe barf ke prayog ko bhi pradarshit karata he
 His igloo was ready in about an hour and was sufficient for five people

 vaani, rucha Manoj Khanderia was a well-known Ghazalakar and poet of the Gujarati language
 sankhya darshan main, prakruti ke teen gun bataae gaye hai - sat, rajas or tamas
 The person does not know anything of truth or untruth when he is the head of all virtues, that is, he lives in the darkness of ignorance
 yani koun si baat uske liye acchhee he vaa koun si buree ye yatharth pataa nahin chalata or is swabhaav ke vyakti ko ye jaanane kii jigyaasa bhi nahin hoti
 The classification between Sattva, Rajas and Tamas is seen in various aspects of Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism, where Tamas is the lowest
 tamas ek shakti hoti he jo ki andhkaar, maut, vinaash or agyanta, susti or pratirodh ko badhaava detii he
 Tamas-effected life results in demerit according to karma; An inferior life-form is demoted
 ek tamsik jivan ko aalasy, laaparvaahee, dwesh, dhokhadhadi, asamvedansheeltaa, aalochana or galati dhundhna, kuntha, lakshyaheen jivan, taarkik soch yaa yojana kii kami or bahaane bananaa, dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Tamasic activities include eating more food and / or consuming drugs and alcohol
 karm dharm or dharmik dharm kaa kendriya siddhant ke asweekruti ke kaaran yah sabase nakaaratmak gun hota he: kisi ko bhi karm karnaa chahie or usase andekhi nahin karnaa chahie
 The six schools of classical Indian philosophy have a Samkhya in which these qualities are defined and detailed
 teenon gunon main se prayek kii apni vishisht visheshtaayen hai or yah mana jaataa he ki sab kuch in teenon se bana he
 Tamas is the lowest, heaviest, slowest and most dull
 It is devoid of the energy of Rajas and the glow of Sattva
 tamas kaa kabhi bhi tamas dwaara virodh nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be resisted through Rajas and it can be even more difficult to convert directly from Tamas to Sattva
