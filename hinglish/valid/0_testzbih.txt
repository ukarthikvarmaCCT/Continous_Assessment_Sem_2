 In the championship games, ball boys and girls, known as BBG, play an important role in the tournament, in short it can be said that a good BBG "should not appear
 They should do their job silently in the background"
 
 1947 se ball bwys kii aapurti goldings ke dwaara kii jaati he, jo inhen uplabdh karaane vaala ek maatr barnados skool he
 Earlier, from the 1920s onwards, ball boys were supplied by Shaftsbury Children's Home

 Since 2008, they are sourced from the London Boroughs schools in Merton, Sattan, Kingston and Wandsworth and Surrey

 Every ball boy is paid for BBG service yaa girl ko 13 din kii avadhi ke baad kul £120-£160 die jate hai
 In addition, it is considered a privilege and an important activity in addition to the core curriculum for students who leave school with discipline

 This tradition is continued at least to some extent
 2009 ke toornament ke dauraan pehali baar, khiladiyon ko scoreboard par unke pehle or aakhri donon naamon se sambodhit kiya gaya
 For example, "andy Murray," not "A

 To this, the chair umpire states “mr

 If a match is played between two competitors of the same surname, the chair umpire addresses both the player's first name and surname during the announcement

 For this, the poet has to imagine a small stanza of captivating goods and trades and display them in very concise and strong language

 jaise - pankaj, ganga, chanchal, kanjus, kanth, thanda, sant, sandhya, mandir, sampadak, sambandh aadi

 Such as: - Hans: Laughing, Angana: Angana, Swang: Swang etc
 atev aise bhram ko dur karne ke liye chandrabindu kaa prayog avashya kiya janaa chahie
 But where there is a lot of difficulty in printing etc
 with the use of the lunar point and the use of the point in place of the lunar point does not cause any confusion, there will be a relaxation of the use of the point in place of the lunar point
 jaise :– nahin, main, main aadi
 In the context of poetry etc

 vyanjan ke neeche laga hal chihn us vyanjan ke swar rahit hone kii soochna detaa he, yani vah vyanjan vishuddh rup se vyanjan he

 Such as: -, speech-, satt-, bhagavan-, sakshat-, jagat-, tejas-, vyudit- etc
 tatsam sambodhan main he rajan, he bhagwan rup hi sweekrut honge
 In the Hindi style, o King, o God, be written
 jin shabdon main hal chihn lupt ho chukaa ho, unamem use phir se lagane kaa praytn na kiya jaae
 Such as - great, scholar etc; Because in Hindi, forms like 'mahanati' and 'vidwanas' have become popular

 in Hindi
 isi tarah 'saakshaatkaar', 'jagadish', 'shatkosh' jaise shabdon ke arth ko samajhane kii aavashyaktaa ho tabhi unki sandhi kaa hawala diya jaae
 In Hindi it would be good to accept them as independent words

 donon hi prakaar ke uccharanon ko vyakt karne ke liye inhen chihnon kaa prayog kiya jaae
 Modifications such as 'gavayya', 'qava' etc
 are not required
 anya udhaaharan hai :– bhaiya, saiyad, taiyaar, hauva aadi

2; Otherwise separately
 yah vaala, yah vaali, pehle vaala, acha vaala, laal vaala, kal vaali baat aadi main vaala nirdeshak shabd he
 Therefore, it should be written separately

 From this we can differentiate at the level of composition
 jaise :–gaanwvaala - villager gaanv vaala makaan - village house 2
