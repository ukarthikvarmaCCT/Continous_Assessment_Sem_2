 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200 ~ 350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150 
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency

 So far, the entire part of the universe has been revealed, there are estimated to be about 19 billion sky Ganges and there are about 10 billion stars in each sky Ganges
 akaash ganga kaa vyas lagbhag ek lakh prakashavarsh he
 The primitive organism was born on our earth 2 billion years ago and man's incarnation on earth happened 10-20 million years ago
 vaigyanikon ke anusaar is brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he
 The Sun is an average star with nine main planets, Earth being one of them
 is brahmad main har ek tara surya sadrush he
 There are many stars in front of which their sun does not even equal to a molecule
 jaise surya ke grah hai or un sabko milakar ham saura parivaar ke naam se pukaarte hai, usee prakaar harek taare kaa apana apana parivaar he
 Many people think that the Sun is stable, but the entire solar family is also moving at a speed of 13 miles per second under the local constellation system

 The distance between wires adjacent to each other can be billions of miles
 jab sate hue taron kaa yah haal he to dur dur sthit taron ke bich kii duuri aisi gananaatit he jise kah paanaa mushkil he
 For this reason, long distances between stars and other light years are measured
 ek prakashavarsh vah duuri he jo duuri prakaash ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar mile prati second kii gati se ek varsh main tay karata he
 For example, the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 125 million miles, light travels this distance in a quarter to eight minutes
 at: prithvi se surya kii duuri sava aath prakaash minute hui
 The distance from the stars through which light comes in eight thousand years, we have measured a quarter to twenty-four padma mi
 lekin taare to itani itani duuri par hai ki unase prakaash ke aane main lakhon, karodon, arabon varsh lag jaataa he
 In this situation we will not be able to express these distances in miles and neither will we understand anything
 isiilie prakashavarsh kii ikai kaa vaigyanikon ne prayog kiya he
 Suppose there is nothing very far after any other constellations of the universe, etc
, but this thing cannot be final
 yadi uske baad kuch he to turant yah prashn saamne aa jaataa he ki vah kuch kahan tak he or uske baad kya he? isiilie hamane is brahmad ko anadi or anant mana
 Apart from this, it is not possible to express the vastness, generality of the universe in other words

 parantu vartmaan paridrishy main brahmad kii puri thaah maanav kshamta se bahut dur he
 The modern era of astrophysics began with the German physicist Kirchak
 surya ke vaataavaran main sodium, louh, magnesium, calcium tathaa anek anya tatwon kaa unhone pataa lagaaya 
 In our country, the late Professor Meghnad Saha has done important work in the study of physical elements of the Sun and stars

 Chandrasekhar and Dr
 Jayant Vishnu Narlikar are also involved in solving the mysteries of the universe
 bahut pehle koparnicus, tiko brahe or mukhyat: capler ne khagol vidya main mahatvaparnu kaary kiya tha
 The three laws that Kepler has proposed in relation to the motion of planets remain the cornerstone of astrophysics
 khagol vidya main newton kaa kaary bahut mahatvapurn rahaa he
 In the field of cosmology, some important things have come up due to the discoveries of the last few years
 vikhyath vaigyanik habal ne apane nirikshanon se brahmadavidya kii ek nai prakriya kaa pataa lagaaya
 Hubble tested the light coming from the far-flung sky Ganges and explained that the vibrations of light waves increase as they reach the Earth
 yadi is prakaash kaa varnapat praapt karen to varnapat kaa jhukaav laal rang kii ore adhik hota he
 This process is called the Doppler effect
 dhwani sambandhi dopalar prabhaav se bahut log parichit honge
 When we look at the Doppler effect in the context of light, the light coming from far away has a blue tilt and the light from a distant light source has a tilt to red
 is prakaar habal ke nirikshanon se yah maaloom hua ki akaash gangaaen hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Hubble also stated that their speed of movement away from Earth is proportional to their distance from Earth
 mount polomer vedhashala main sthit 200 inch vyasavaale lens kii doorabeen se khagol shastriyon ne akaash gangaaon ke dur hatane kii prakriya ko dekha he
 When we look at the universe with a telescope, we feel that we are the center of this universe and other things are running away from us
 yadi anya akaash gangaaon main prekshak bheje jaaen to ve bhi yahi paaenge ki is brahmad ke centre bindu hai, baaki akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi hai
 The correct picture that comes to us now is that the universe is expanding at the same speed
 or is vishaal praaroop kaa koi bhi bindu anya vastuon se dur hatataa ja rahaa he
 After Hubble's research, the rendering of the principles of the universe became necessary
 yah vah samay tha jab ki ainstin kaa saapekshavaad kaa siddhant apni shaishvavastha main tha
 However, Einstein's theory was more successful than Newton's theories in interpreting findings based on solar system observations
 newton ke anusaar do pindon ke bich kii guru tvkarshan shakti ek duusare par tatkaal prabhaav daalati he lekin ainstin ne yah sabit kar diya ki parsparik guru tvkarshan kii shakti kii gati prakaash kii gati ke samaan teevr nahin ho sakati he
 After all, here Einstein misinformed Newton's letter
 logon ko ainstin kaa hi siddhant pasand aayaa
 Three concepts of the origin of the universe are presented xxrep 4 - 1
 sthir avasthaa kaa siddhant 2
 Explosion Theory and 3
 dolan siddhant
 The second assumption is more important in these assumptions
 is dharna ke anusaar brahmad kii utpatti ek mahapind ke visphot se hui he or isi kaaran akaash gangaaen hamase dur bhaagti ja rahi he
 If you put the inverted picture of this universe in front of you, then you will see the universe becoming disheveled, and the sky will appear as if the Ganges is not running
 at: kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kisi samay koi mahapind rahaa hoga or usee ke visphot hone ke kaaran akaash gangaaen bhaagti hui hamase dur ja rahi hai
 Explosion theory is also confirmed by the discovery of new wires called quasars and pulsars

 Kumbh festival is an important festival of Hinduism, in which crores of devotees take bath in Kumbh festival at Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nashik
 inamen se prayek sthaan par prati barahawein varsh or prayag main do kumbh parvon ke bich chah varsh ke antaraal main ardhakumbh bhi hota he
 The 2013 Kumbh took place in Prayag
 2019 main prayag main ardhakumbh meley kaa aayojan hoga
 According to astronomical calculations, this fair starts on the day of Makar Sankranti, when the Sun and Moon enter Scorpio, and Jupiter, Aries
 makar sankranti ke hone vaale is yoga ko "kumbh snaan-yoga" kehete hai or is din ko vishesh mangalik mana jaataa he, kyonki aisa mana jaataa he ki is din prithvi se ucch lokon ke dwaar is din khulte hai or is prakaar is din snaan karne se aatma ko ucch lokon kii prapti sahajata se ho jaati he
 Bathing here is considered to be a heavenly vision
 ‘ardh’ shabd kaa arth hota he aadha or isi kaaran baarah varshon ke antaraal main yojit hone vaale purna kumbh ke bich arthath purna kumbh ke chha: varsh baad ardh kumbh yojit hota he
 The last Kumbh in Haridwar took place in 1998
 haridwar main 26 janvari se 14 may 2004 tak chalaa tha ardh kumbh mela, uttaranchal rajya ke gathan ke pashchaat aisa pratham avasar tha
 During this, 14 April 2004 was considered the most auspicious day for the holy bath
 puranic vishwaas jo kuch bhi ho, jyotishiyon ke anusaar kumbh kaa asaadhaaran mahatv brihaspati ke kumbh raashi main pravesh tathaa surya ke mesh raashi main pravesh ke saath judaa he
 The position of the planets medicates the Ganges water at Har ki Pauri place on the banks of the Ganges flowing from Haridwar and it becomes nectaric in those days
 yahi kaaran he ki apni antaratma kii shuddhi hetu pavitra snaan karne lakhon shraddhalu yahan aate hai
 From the spiritual point of view, the position of planets during the period of Ardh Kumbh is excellent for concentration and meditation
 haalaanki sabhi hindu tyohaar samaan shraddha or bhakthi ke saath manaae jate he, par yahan ardh kumbh tathaa kumbh meley ke liye aane vaale paryatakon kii sankhya sabase adhik hoti he
 There are two or three mythological stories about the celebration of Kumbh festival, the most popular of which is the fall of nectar drops from Kumbh, the nectar received from the sea churning by the gods and goddesses
 is katha ke anusaar maharishi durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran jab indra or anya devtaa kamjor ho gaye to daityon ne devataaon par akraman kar unhen parrast kar diya
 Then all the gods together went to Lord Vishnu and told him all the accounts
 tab bhagwaan vishnu ne unhe daityon ke saath milakar kshirsagar kaa manthan karke amrit nikaalane kii salaah di
 At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity tried to make a treaty with the demons to extract the nectar
 amrit kumbh ke nikalate hi devataaon ke ishaare se indraputra 'jayant' amrit-kalash ko lekar akaash main ud gaya
 The demons then pursued Jayant to take back the nectar as per the order of Shyagacharya and after intense exertion, they caught Jayant in the middle
 tatpashchaat amrit kalash par adhikaar jamaane ke liye dev-daanvon main baarah din tak aviraam yuddh hota rahaa
 During this interconnection, nectar drops fell from the urn at four places of the earth
 us samay chandramaa ne ghat se prasravan hone se, surya ne ghat footne se, guru ne daityon ke apharan se evam shani ne devendra ke bhay se ghat kii raksha kii
 To calm discord, God took the form of a siren and gave it amrit to everyone and gave them drink
 is prakaar dev-daanav yuddh kaa ant kiya gaya
 For the attainment of nectar, there was a continuous war between the dev-danavs for twelve days
 devataaon ke baarah din manushyon ke baarah varsh ke tulya hote hai
 Hence, Aquarius is also twelve
 unamem se chaar kumbh prithvi par hote hai or shesh aath kumbh devloak main hote hai, jinhen devgan hi praapt kar sakate hai, manushyon kii vahaan pahunch nahin he
 When the lunar-sunic planets guarding the current zodiacs are protected at the time when the Chandradikas protect the Kalash, then the sum of Aquarius is there, ie the year in which the Sun, Moon and Jupiter coincide
 That is, in the same year, in the sum of the same zodiac sign, Kumbh festival takes place wherever the nectar drops fell

 is prakaar har varsh main 365 din, 5 ghante, 49 minute or 12 second hote he
 In the Julian calendar, 365 days was considered a 6-hour year, but assuming it takes 11 minutes 14 seconds more than a revolutionary solar year each year
 yah aadhiky 400 varshon main 3 din se kuch adhik ho jaataa he
 Pope Gregory of Rome first considered this mistake subtly
 unhone isvi san 1582 main hisaab lagaakar dekha ki naaise nagar ke dharm-sammelan ke samay se, jo isvi san 325 main hua tha, purvokt aadhiky 10 din kaa ho gaya he, jisko gananaa main nahin lene ke kaaran taarikh 10 din peeche chal rahi thi
 With this idea, he decided the 15th of October in 1582 AD in consultation with the astrologer Allay Sius Lilius of Naples, and since then took the rule that the century, if divided completely by 400, instead of being completely divided by year 4 It should be considered as leap year or not
 is naveen paddati kaa aarambh chunki pope gregory ne kiya, isliye isko gregorian paddati athwa naveen paddati kaha gaya
 This method was accepted in different Christian countries in different years
 isse in deshon kaa itihaas padhate samay is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana aavashyak he
 This new method was adopted by Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal in 1582, Prussia, the Roman Catholic Territories of Germany, Switzerland and Flanders in 1583, Poland in 1586, Hungary in 1587, Protestants from Germany and the Netherlands
 Territory and Denmark in 1700, British Empire in 1752, Japan in 1972, China in 1912, Bulgaria in 1915, Turkey and Soviet Russia in 1917 and Yugoslavia and Su Romania adopted in 1919 AD
 1582 isvi ke baad 1700 i0 main 28 farvari tak puraane calendar se naye calendar kii taarikh main 10 din kii hi vruddhi rahi
 Since 1600 AD was a century, it was completely divided by 400, so it would have been a leap year by the new method
 atah usamen taarikh main antar karne hetu 1 din kii vruddhi nahin hui
 This means that changing the date from the old calendar to the new calendar will be progressively increased from the aforesaid 10 days to one day in the same century years in which the 400 years do not completely participate
 arthath 1700 isvi kii 28 farvari ke baad naye calendar kii taarikh banane ke liye 10 din kii jagah 11 din jode jaayenge
 Similarly, 12 days will be added after 28 February of 1800 AD and 13 days after 28 February of 1900 AD
 punah 2000 i0 400 se puri tarah vibhajit hone ke kaaran yah vruddhi 13 din kii hi rahegi, atirikt 1 din nahin badhegaa

 saanchaa:comics infobox sec / formcatsazca:comics infobox sec / genrecat Watchmen is a twelve-digit limited series comic book produced by author Alan Moore artist Dave Gibbons and illustrator John Higgins
 shrinkhalaa DC comics dwaara 1986 or 1987 ke dauraan prakashit kii gai thi or uske baad ek sankalit graphic upanyaas main punarprakashit kii gai
 Watchmen originated from a proposed story submitted by Moore to DC, featuring superhero characters that the company acquired from Charlton Comics
 chunki moore kii prastaavit kahani, bhavi kahaniyon ke liye kai paatro ko anupayogi bana detii, prabandh-sampadak dick jiordno ne lekhak ko iske bajaay mul charitron ke nirmaan ke liye raji kiya
 Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary concerns and to interpret the superhero concept
 wachamen ek vaikalpik itihaas vaali prithvi par ghatit hoti he, jahaan vietnam yuddh jeetne main america kii madad karne ke liye 1940 or 1960 ke dashak main superhiro ubharate hai
 The country is approaching a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, independent security administrators are disarmed and costumed superheroes have retired or are working for the government
 kahani vyaktigat vikaas or mukhya paatro ke sangharsh par dhyaan kendrit karti he, jab sarkaar pryojit ek superhiro kii hatya kii jaanch unhen sevanivritti se baahar khinchati he or ant main unka ek saazish se saamana karwaati he, jahaan unhen parmaanu yuddh ko taalna he jo lakhon logon kii maut kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Creatively, the focus of Watchmen is its structure
 gibans ne puri shrinkhalaa main ek nau panel ke grid le-out kaa upyog kiya or aavarti pratikon ko joda, jaise khun se sanaa hua smaili
 sirf aakiri ank main poorak kaalpanik dastavej dikhte hai, jo shrinkhalaa kii pichhali kahani ko sanyojit karte hai or vrittant ke saath ek tels of da blike frator naamak ek kaalpanik samudri daaku kii anya comic kahani gunthi hui he, jise ek kirdaar padhata he
 In this graphic novel, time, time and plot change, which proves to be a real zigzag
 wachamen ko comics or mukhyadhara, donon tarah ke akhabaaron main aalochanatmak prashansaaen praapt hui hai or ise aalochak graphic upanyaas madhyam kii ek moulik kriti maanate hai
 Director Jack Snyder's Watchmen was released in March 2009, after several attempts to convert the series into a feature film
 "I suppose i was just thinking, 'that'd be a good way to start a comic book: have a famous super-hero found dead
' As the mystery unraveled, we would be led deeper and deeper into the real heart of this super-hero's world, and show a reality that was very different to the general public image of the super-hero
" In 1985, DC Comics acquired a range of characters from Charlton Comics
 us avadhi ke dauraan, lekhak alan moore ne li se hat kar superhiro ko pesh karte hue ek kahani likhane kaa vichaar kiya, jaisaa ki unhone 1980 ke dashak main apane mirecleman shrinkhalaa main kiya tha
 Moore argued that the Mighty Crusaders of MLJ Comics might be available for such a project, so he thought of a mysterious murder plot that begins with The Shield's corpse being found at a port
 lekhak ko laga ki ve antat kin paatro ke samooh kaa istemaal karte hai, isse koi fark nahin padataa, jab tak ki pathak unhen pahachaanate hai "isliye isamen chaunkaane vaala or aashcharya kaa gun rahegaa, jab aap in paatro kii vaastaviktaa ko dekhenge
" moore ne is aadhaar kaa istemaal kiya or charlton charitron ko pesh karte hue hu kild da pisamekar sheershak se ek prastaav taiyaar kiya or DC ke prabandh sampadak dick jiordno ko apraarthit prastaav saunpa
 jiordno ko prastaav sweekaar tha, lekin sampadak ne kahani ke liye charlton charitron ke upyog ke vichaar kaa virodh kiya
 Moore said, "DC realized that their expensive characters would either die in the end or go waste
" Instead, Giordano persuaded Moore to rework his presentation to introduce the original characters
 Moore initially believed that the original characters would not be able to provide emotional echoes for readers, but later changed their minds
 unhone kaha, "aakhirkaar, mujhe ehsaas hua ki yadi main vaikalpik paatro ko zaraa achche se likhata hum, taaki ve kuch myanon main parichit se lagen, unke kuch vishisht pahalu saamaanya super hero kii pratidhwani ko waapas laate hai yaa pathak ko parichit lagate hai, to yah safal ho saktaa he
 " chitrakaar dev gibans ko, jo pichhali pariyojnaon main moore ke saath rahe the, pataa laga ki lekhak ek simit shrinkhalaa par kaam kar rahe hai
 The painter said that he too wanted to join it, so Moore sent him the outline of the story
 Gibbons told Giordano that he wanted to portray the series, which Moore proposed and Moore approved
 Gibbons included the painter John Higgins in the project, as he liked his 'unusual' style; Higgins lived close to the painter, allowing the two to "have some human interaction and discussion, rather than just sending them across the ocean"
 Len Wayne joined it as the editor of the project, while Giordano supervised it
 Both Wayne and Giordano retreated and "went out of their way", Giordano later said, "who's going to edit Alan Moore?" pariyojna par aage kaary karne kii manzuri mil jane ke baad, moore or gibans ne paatro kaa nirmaan, kahani ke parivesh kii sajaavat or prabhaavon par charchaa karne ke liye gibans ke ghar par ek din bitaayaa
 yah jodi vishesh rup se superman kii ek "superduparman" naam kii betuki parody se prabhavit thi; moore ne kaha, "ham superduparman ko 180 degree le janaa chaahate the - kamedi kii bajaay naatakeey
" moore or gibans ne ek aisi kahani kii kalpana kii, jo "puraane dhang ke parichit super hero ko ek puri tarah se nae daayre main" le jaaegi; lekhak ne kaha ki unka iraadaa "ek super hero mobi dick banane kaa tha; kuch aisa jisamen vaisaa hi vazan, vaisaa hi ghanatv ho
 lekhak ne kirdaaron ke naam or vivaran nishchit kiye, par unki bahya rupagat visheshtaon ko gibans par chhod diya
 gibans ne soch-vichaar ke baad un paatro ko dizine nahin kiya, balki "aniyamit samay par


 shaayad do yaa teen hafte sirf sketch karte hue bitaye
" gibans ne apane kirdaaron ko kuch aise dizine kiya ki unhen banane main aasaani ho; rorak kii chitrakaari unka pasandida rahi, kyonki "aapako sirf ek topi bananaa he
 If you can make a hat, you make the Rorschach, you just make a shape for his face and put some black splatter on it and you're done
 " Moore began writing the series much earlier, to avoid delays in publication, as was the case with the DC limited series 3000 Kemalot
 pehle ank ke liye patakatha likhte samay, moore ne kaha ki unhone mahasoos kiya ki "mere paas keval chah ankon ke liye paryaapt patakatha thi
 We were contracted for 12! ”their solution was to tweak the points that were associated with the origin of the characters related to the plot of the entire series
 moore ne gibans ke kaam ke liye kaaphi vistrut patakatha likhi
 gibans yaad karte hai ki "wachamen ke pehle ank ke liye usne, mujhe lagata he 101 prishthon kaa single spes main tankit patakatha bheja, jahaan prayek panel vivaran ke bich yaa, vastutah, prishthon ke bich bhi koi antaraal nahin tha
 "upon receiving the screenplay, the artist had to serialize each page sequentially," because if i drop them on the floor, it will take me two days to put them back in the right order "and clear the letters and shot descriptions
 Used a highlighter pen to do this; he said, "before you actually run the pen on paper, it requires a lot of management" Moore Despite Mr
 detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note, "if it worked on did not work, as it may deem just enter" Still directions Gibbons Moore
 gibans ke paas wachamen ke drishy viksit karne ke liye kaaphi azaadi thi or unhone aksar prishthbhumi vivaran jode, jin par kaaphi baad main gaur karne kii baat moore ne sweekaari
 ank main shaamil karne ke liye anusandhanparak sawaalon ke jawaab or uddharanon ke liye, moore ne yada-kada saathi comics lekhak nil gayaman se sampark kiya
 Despite his intentions, Moore acknowledged in November 1986 that there was a possibility of delay and said that while issue # 5 had been released, he was still busy writing issue nine
 gibans ne kaha ki deree kaa ek pramukh kaarak, moore kii patakatha kaa "kishton main" milanaa tha
 Gibbons said the team's pace slowed around the fourth mark; Since that time the two have started their work "just several pages at a time
 i would have received three pages of screenplay from Alan and i would have made them and then finally called him and said 'feed me! And he again Sending two or three pages or maybe even one or sometimes even six pages
 As the creators met the deadline, Moore hired a taxi driver and traveled 50 miles and handed the script to Gibbons
 Later Points But the artist enlisted the help of wife and son to create panel grids on the pages to save time
 Moore also cut short a description of 'ozymandius' because Gibbons was unable to summarize that dialogue into one page, where Ozimendius, Prevents a covert attack by Rorschach
 pariyojna ke antim kshanon main, moore ko ehsaas hua ki kahani main televijan shrinkhalaa da outer limits ke ek episod "da architects of feer" se samanthaayen maujuud hai
 The author and Wayne argue over changing the end of the story; Moore won, but accepted it, citing the serial in the final issue of the series
 wachamen ek vaikalpik vaastaviktaa main set he jo baariki se 1980 ke dashak kii samakaleen duniya ko pratibimbit karata he
 The primary difference is the presence of superheroes

 This replay of America has been shown to dramatically affect and alter the outcome of real-world events such as the Vietnam War and President Richard Nixon's period
 In keeping with the realism of the series, although the Watchmen 'costumed crime fighters are commonly called "superheroes", Doctor Manhattan is the only character to have apparent supernatural powers
 Doctor Manhattan's presence gave America a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which increased tensions between the two countries
 Ultimately, superheroes become unpopular among the police and the public, leading to a bill declaring them illegal in 1977
 While many of the heroes were retired, Doctor Manhattan and The Comedian continued to serve as government-approved agents, and Rorschach continued his work outside the law

 Watt explains that his plan is to save humanity from a possible nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union, under which he will launch a false foreign invasion of New York City, destroying half the city's population
 He hopes that this will unite the country against a common enemy
 He also reveals that he murdered The Comedian, arranges Dr
 Manhattan's old colleagues to suffer from cancer, performs a murderous attack on himself to keep himself beyond the realm of suspicion, and eventually Rorschach Staged Moloch's death to ensnare him and do all this to save his misdeeds from being busted

 Alan Moore's intention through Watchmen was to create four or five "fundamental opposing ways" of seeing the world, and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which of these methods is most acceptable morally
 pathakon ke gale ke neeche "ulti bahati naitikta " vaali dharna or hero ko ek ubhaybhavi prakaash main dikhaane kii koshish main moore kaa vishwaas nahin tha

 The Comedian was based on the Charlton Comics character Peacemaker, which also featured elements from the Marvel comic's detective character Nick Fury

 The Doctor was based on Captain Atom of Manhattan Charlton, surrounded by the shadow of a nuclear threat in Moore's original proposal
 baharhaal, lekhak ko laga ki captain atom ke saath pher-badal karne kii bajaay vah manahattan ke saath ek "kwantum super hero kii bhaanti" kuch adhik kar sakate hai
 Unlike other superheroes who lack scientific exploration of their origins, Moore researched nuclear physics and quantum physics to create Dr
 Manhattan's character
 The author believed that a character living in a quantum universe would not experience time from a direct perspective, which would affect that character's perception of human affairs
 Moore refrained from creating an emotionless character like the Spoke of Star Trek, so he sought to uphold "human habits" in Dr
 Manhattan and rise above them and then get beyond humanity in general
 Gibbons created the blue character Rogue Trooper and reported that he reused the blue skin motif for Doctor Manhattan, as it matched the skin's configuration but differed in color
 moore ne kahani main rang ko shaamil kiya or gibans ne kaha ki comics ke baaki rang yojana ne manahattan ko anoothaa bana diya
 moore ne yaad karte hue kaha ki ve is baat ko lekar sashankit the ki kya DC, rachanakaaron ko is charitra ko puri tarah se nagn chithran karne kii anumati degaa, jisase aanshik rup se is charitra kaa chithran prabhavit hua
 Gibbons wanted to be interesting in his portrayal of Manhattan's nudity, choosing carefully at the time of presentation of the entire forearm and giving it "inferior" genitalia - like a classical sculpture - so it would not initially get the reader's attention

 Richard Reynolds stated that by taking the initiative to "help the world", Watt displayed a trait that is normally reflected in the villain in superhero stories and in a sense he is the series 'villain'

 Moore said he was "trying to create this idyllic Steve Ditko character - someone with a funny name, starting with the nickname 'K', with a strangely designed mask"
 Moore based Rorschack on Ditko's creation mr

 Moore and Gibbons designed Watchmen to showcase the unique qualities of the comics medium and to highlight its special powers
 1986 ke ek saakshaatkaar main, moore ne kaha, "main un kshetron kaa pataa lagane kii koshish karnaa chahta hum jahaan comics safal hui he or jahaan koi anya media kaary karne main sakasham nahin hua he" or comics or film ke bich matbhed par bal dete hue is par jor diya
 moore ne kaha ki wachamen ko "chaar yaa paanch baar padhane ke liye," banaaya gaya tha, jiske tahat kuch links or sanket the jo kai baar padhane ke baad hi pathak ko spasht hote hai
 Dave Gibbons writes that, "it moved forward, Watchmen became more focused on the way of telling, than the story

that is not the most interesting thing about Watchmen
 jaise hi ham asal main kahani sunaane ke kareeb pahunche, vahiin se vaastavik rachanaatmakataa shuru hui
 Gibbons stated that he deliberately created the visual appearance of Watchmen, so that each page could be identified as part of that particular series and "not another comic book"
 He made a concerted effort to portray himself differently from characters commonly seen in comics
 rangakaar jon higgins ne ek khaake kaa istemaal kiya jo "manahosthitiparak" tha or unhone madhyamik rangon ko tarjeeh di

 Moore stated that the artist paid special attention to light and subtle color changes; In issue six, Higgins started with "warm and cheerful" colors, and gradually deepened the colors throughout the issue to give the story a dark and tart feel

 "vahaan gati or drishy prabhaav kaa aisa tatv tha jiske bare main ab ve purvanumaan laga sakate the or iskaa istemaal naatakeey prabhaav ke liye kar sakate the
 "the Comics Journal's Bhob Stewart mentioned to Gibbons in 1987 that the page lay-out was reminiscent of EC comics, in addition to the art itself, in which Stewart felt particularly echoed by John Severin
 Gibbons agreed that the EC style The echo of K's lay-out was "a very deliberate thing", though his inspiration was Harvey Kurtzman, it was altered enough to give the series a unique look
 prayek ank kaa mukh prishth kahani ke liye pehle panel ke rup main kaary karata he
 Gibbons said, "watchmen's face is in the real world and looks very real, but it turned into a comics book, a gateway to another dimension

 Content includes fictional book chapters, letters, reports and articles written by various Watchman characters
 DC had trouble selling advertising space in Watchmen's numbers, leaving eight to nine additional pages in each issue
 DC planned to put home advertisements and long-letter columns to fill the space, but editor Len Wayne felt it would be wrong for everyone who also wrote during the series' final four digits
 He decided to use additional pages to fill the series' backdrop

 "gibbons suggests a pirate theme, and Moore agrees partly because he is" a big fan of Bertolt Brecht ": The Black Frater understands the gesture by listening to the song Seeräuberjenny from Brecht's Threepenny Opera
 moore ne siddhant diya ki chunki superhiro kaa astitv hota he or unka astitv ek "bhay, ghrinaa or tiraskaar kii vastu ke rup main hota he, comic pustakon main pramukh superhiro jaldi hi lokapriyata se pare ho gaye, jaisaa hamane sujhaayaa he

 Moore chose Orlando, because he felt that if pirate tales had been popular in the Watchmen universe, DC editor Julius Schwartz would have tried to entice the painter to draw a pirate comic book in the company
 Orlando contributed a drawing whose design was as if it were a page of supplementary excerpts from a fake title

 chunki kahani adhik jatil ban gai, moore ne kaha ki wachamen "satta ke bare main or samaaj ke bheetar superman prastutikaran ke vichaar ke bare main" ban gaya
 The series is titled with the question "who watches the Watchmen?" Refers to, though Moore stated in a 1986 interview with Amazing Heroes that he did not know where that sentence originated
 After reading the interview, author Harlan Ellison told Moore that the sentence was raised by Roman satirist Juvenal, "quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" The translation of the question is

 bradford rhite ne wachamen ko "saamaanya rup se hero kii or vishesh rup se superhiro kii avadharana ke liye moore ke mrityulekh" ke rup main varnit kiya
 Putting the story in a contemporary social context, Wright wrote that the characters in Watchmen were Moore's "warning to those who rely on 'heroes' and leaders to protect the fate of the world
" " unhone aage kaha ki is tarah ke aradhyon / vyaktitvon par vishwaas karne kaa arth he vyaktigat zimmedaari ko "rigans, thatchers or duniya ke anya 'wachamen' ke upar chhod dena, jo mana jaataa he ki hamen bachaate hai or shaayad is prakriya main grah ko barbaad karte hai"
 moore ne vishesh rup se 1986 main kaha ki ve wachamen ko "americavaad ke virdohi nahin, riganvaad virdohi" hone ke liye likh rahe the, vishesh rup se yah maanate hue ki "is pal reagan ke america ke kuch hisse main dar nahin he

 Richard Reynolds adds that Watchmen 'superheroes are forced to face "relatively more abstract social and moral concerns" without an accountant in the story, adding that they further conceptualized superheroes from the general descriptive expectations of this genre

 ek vidha ban gaya
 "in 2003, he said," To some extent, in the 15 years after Watchmen, many lewd comics preferred these grim, pessimistic, filthy, violent stories that Watchmen use, literally, only to have very bad stories, including Nothing worth recommending, are to validate
 gibans ne kaha ki jahaan pathakon ko "is vichaar ke saath chhod diya gaya ki yah ek gambhir or apriy jaisi chiz he", unhone apane vichaar main kaha ki yah shrinkhalaa "superhiro kaa utana hi shandaar utsav he, jitna kii kisi or chiz kaa

 Moore stated in 1985 that if the limited series received good acceptance, he and Gibbons would likely produce a 12-digit prequel series called Minutemen, featuring the story's 1940s superhero group
 Steve Whiteaker joked in the British fantasy fantasy advertiser that such a story would naturally revolve around "gay women and men in relationships in the 40s and men dressed up 


"
 DC offered Moore and Gibbons the possibility to publish a prequel to the series, such as the Rorschach Journal or The Comedians' Vietnam War Diary, as well as pointing to the possibility of using the same universe by other authors
 Comedian's Vietnam Tales of the war experience spread because the name 'the' was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, a "night owl / Rorschach team"
 a )
 Both individuals did not feel that the stories could do anything, where Moore was particularly determined that DC would not proceed with stories by other individuals
 Gibbons was more attracted to the idea of the Minutemen series, as it "paid tribute to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of the Golden Age comic books - with the dramatic interest that this would be a story that would be foreseen
 Seeing this, perhaps, It will be interesting how we come to this conclusion

 Moore added," So basically they are not ours, but if DC works with these characters in our interest If doing, they can be
 duusari taraf, agar paatro ne apane prakritik jivan-kaal ko paar kar liya he or DC unke saath kuch bhi nahin karnaa chahta he, to ek saal baad ve hamen milenge or ham unke saath jaisaa karnaa chahenge vaisaa kar sakate hai, jisase main purna rup se khush hum
" Moore stated that he left DC in 1989 for his v for Vendetta series with artist David Lloyd and due to language in a contract for Watchmen
 Moore felt the repatriation clause was ultimately meaningless, as DC did not intend the publication to go out of print
 He told the New York Times in 2006, "I said, 'enough happened', 'you successfully managed to defraud me and so i will never work for you again
" In 2000 Moore publicly disassociated himself from dc's fifteenth anniversary plan to release Watchmen hardcover, as well as a proposed line of combat personalities from DC Direct
 While DC wanted to improve its relationship with the author, Moore felt that the company was not treating him honestly regarding his America's Best Comic imprint
 Moore said, "as far as I'm concerned, 1986, jab nirmaataa laurence gordon or joel silver ne 20th centuri fox ke liye shrinkhalaa ke film adhikaar praapt kiye, uske baad se wachamen kaa film sanskaran banane kaa kai baar prayaas ho chukaa he
 Fox asked Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but he declined, so the studio listed Sam Hamm, the screenwriter
 ham ne is avasar kaa laabh, wachamen ke jatil ant ko ek hatya or ek samay virodhabhas ko shaamil karte hue ise "adhik prabandhaneey" nishkarsh ke punah lekhan main kiya 
 fox ne 1991 main is pariyojna ko prativartan main rakhaa, or yah pariyojna warner bros ke paas chali gai, jahaan terry gillium nirdesan or charles maikion iske punarlekhan se jude
 unhone rorak charitra kii diary kaa prayog parshv swar ke liye kiya or comic book ke un drishyon ko phir se behaal kiya jinhen ham ne hataa diya tha
 Gilliam and Silver were able to collect only $ 25 million for the film as their previous films exceeded the budget
 ghilium ne pariyojna ko tyaag diya kyonki unhone faisla kiya ki wachamen ko filmaaya nahin ja saktaa
" ko kam karke do yaa dhai ghante kii film bananaa mujhe lag rahaa tha ki wachamen ke saar ko hataa dene jaisaa tha," unhone kaha
" warner bros dwaara pariyojna ko khaarij kar dene ke baad, gordon ne ghilium ko swatantra rup se film kaa sanchaalan karne ke liye waapas aamantrit kiya
 The director again refused, believing that this comic book could be better directed as a five-hour short-series
 " In October 2001, Gordon partnered with Lloyd Levine and Universal Studios, with David Hatter as director and writer
 Hatter and the producers left Universal due to creative differences, and Gordon and Levine showed interest in the introduction of Watchmen at Revolution Studios
 The project did not run simultaneously at Revolution Studios and disintegrated

 In October 2005, Gordon and Levine met with Warner Bros
 to develop the film again
 Impressed by Jack Snyder's work at 300, Warner Bros
 approached him to direct the Watchmen's conversion
 patakatha lekhak elex tse, hatter kii patakatha se apane pasandida tatwon ko liya, lekin ise wachamen kii sheet yuddh kii mul setting main lautaaya
 300 main apane drushtikon kii tarah, snidar ne comic pustak ko ek katha board ke rup main istemaal kiya
 He enhanced the fight scenes and added a sub-plot about energy resources to make the film more contemporary
 Although he intended to be honest with the character's characterization in the comic, Snyder wanted Night Owl to look a bit more creepy and make Ozimandias' armor a parody of the rubbery muscle suit of the 1997 superhero film Batman & Robin
 After the film's first telecast of the film's trailer in July 2008, DC Comic Chairman Paul Levitz stated that the company had to print more than 900,000 copies of Watchman's merchandise collection to meet the additional demand for the advertising campaign-borne book, bringing the total The annual print was expected to exceed one million copies

 The film itself was released on DVD four months after The Tales of the Black Freighter, and according to estimates Warner Bros
 is considering releasing an enhanced version, where the animated film will be edited back into the main picture

 dev gibans, sneader kii film par ek salaahkaar ban gaye, lekin moore ne apni kriti ke kisi bhi film roopantaran se apane naam ko jodne se manaa kar diya
 moore ne kaha ki sneader ke roopantaran ko dekhne main unki koi dilchaspee nahin he; unhone 2008 main antertenment vikali se kaha, "hamane wachamen main aisi kuch chijen kii hai jo sirf ek comic main kaam aati he or vastav main unhen un chizon ko dikhaane ke liye aise dizine kiya gaya tha jo anya media nahin dikhaa sakate"

 Since its release, Watchmen has received acclaim as a seminal work through the comic book

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Black hole ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 In general relativity, a black hole or a black hole or a Krishna vivar is such an astronomical object with such a powerful gravitational field that nothing can escape the light, including the stretch
 kalenidr ke chaaron ore ghatana kshitij naamak ek seemaa hoti he jisamen vastuen gir to sakati hai parantu baahar kuch nahin aa saktaa
 It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light falling on it and does not reflect anything

 Quantum analysis of the black hole shows that they contain temperature and Hawking radiation
 apane adrishy bhitari bhaag ke baavjood, ek kalachhidr anya padaarthon ke saath antah-kriya ke madhyam se apni upasthiti prakat kar saktaa he
 For example, black holes can be detected by the motion of a group of stars orbiting a part of the space that appears empty
 vaikalpik rup se, ek saathi taare dwaara aap apekshaakrit chote kalenidr main gas giraate hue dekh sakate hai
 This gas spirals inwards, heating up to very high temperatures and emits large amounts of radiation that can be detected by telescopes located on Earth or orbiting the Earth

 By these methods, scientists have discovered that a radio source called Dhanu a *, located in the center of our galaxy, Kshirmarg, has a giant black hole whose mass is 43 million times the mass of our sun
 saidhantik rup se, kisi bhi maatra kaa padaarth ek kalachhidr ban saktaa he, yadi vah itani jagah ke bheetar sankuchit ho jaay jisaki trigya apni samatuly schvarsscield trigya ke baraabar ho
 Accordingly, the mass of our Sun is 3 km

 vyaavhaarik rup main electron or neutron aapjatya dabaav ke vipareet na to prithvi or na hi suraj main aavashyak dravyaman he or isliye na hi aavashyak gurutvkarshan bal he
 The minimum mass required for a star to be able to recover from these pressures and to be more compressed is the extent proposed by Tolman - Oppenheimer - Volkoff, which is about three solar masses
 ek kalenidr ko aksar ek aisi vastu rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jiskaa palaayan veg prakaash kii gati se adhik ho
 This picture is qualitatively incorrect but provides a way of understanding the order of magnitude of the radius of the black hole
 palaayan veg vah nunatam gati he jo ek vastu main honi chahie taaki vah vastu rukne se pehle kisi guruttvakarshan strot kii kaksha se bachakar nikal jaye
 The escape velocity on Earth is equal to 11
2 km / s, so no matter what the object is, a bullet or a ball, it must move at least 11
2 km / s to avoid falling back to the surface of the Earth
 neutonian yantriki main palaayan veg kii gananaa hetu, maaniye ki ek baari vastu he jiskaa dravyaman m mul par kendrit he
 a second object with a m { \ displaystyle m} mass starts at a v { \ displaystyle v} speed at a distance of r { \ displaystyle r} from the origin, tries to escape towards the infinity, with exactly the same kinetic energy
 Should be so that it can overcome the potential energy of negative gravity, leaving nothing later: is prakaar, yah jaise jaise r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r= \ infty } ke kareeb aati jaati he vaise vaise isaki gatij urja kam hoti jaati he, antat yah bina kisi gati ke ananthata par pahunch jaati he
 This formula represents the critical migration velocity v { \ displaystyle v} in terms of m { \ displaystyle M} and r { \ displaystyle r}
 lekin yah formula yah bhi kahata he ki v { \ displaystyle v} or m { \ displaystyle M} kii prayek value ke liye, r { \ displaystyle r} kii ek critical value hoti he taaki v { \ displaystyle v} gati vaala ek kan bhaagane maatr main safal rahe: When the velocity is equal to the speed of light, it provides the radius of an imaginary Newtonian dark star, a Newtonian body from which no particle moving at the speed of light can escape
 ek kalenidr kii trigya kii value ke liye sarvaadhik prayukt chalan main, ghatana kshitij kii trigya is neutonian value ke baraabar hoti he
 In general relativity, it is not easy to define r coordinates because of the curved nature of space-time and the selection of different coordinates
 is parinaam ke satya hone ke liye, r kii value ko is prakaar paribhaashit karnaa chahie taaki vakrit antariksh samay main r trigya ek sphier ke a satahi kshetra ko abhi bhi is formula dwaara prakat kiya ja sake a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle A=4 \ pi r^{2}} r kii is paribhaasha se koi arth tabhi nikalataa he jab gurutvkarshan kshetra spherickli samamit ho, taaki vahaan ek ke upar ek kai siyaar hon jinpar ekasmaan gurutvkarshan kshetra ho
 The escape velocity depends on the density of an object to escape its gravitational field; This is the ratio of its mass to volume
 ek kalachhidr tab banataa he jab koi vastu itani ghani ho jaye ki kisi khaas duuri tak prakaash bhi usase bachakar na jane paye, kyonki prakaash kii gati kalenidr ke palaayan veg se kam hogi
 Unlike Newtonian gravity, in general relativity, the light moving away from the black hole does not slow down and turn back
 schvarjaschild trigya abhi bhi vah antim duuri he jahaan se prakaash anantta ke liye batch saktaa he, lekin schvarjaschild trigya se shuru hokar baahar nikalne vaala prakaash waapas nahin aata he, vah baahar hi rahata he
 Inside the Schwarzschild radius, each object moves inwards, somehow to be crushed in the center

 There is a circular border around this singularity called the event horizon
 yah ghatana kshitij ko 'waapas lautne kaa sthaan' hota he, ek seemaa jiske pare saare padaarth or vikiran bheetar singhulerity kii taraf khinche chale aate hai
 Centrally, the distance between this singularity and the event horizon is the size of the black hole and is equal to twice the mass in the unit where g and c are equal to 1
 surya ke baraabar dravyaman vaale kalenidr kii trigya lagbhag 3 kimi hoti he
 For distances many times greater than this, the gravitational power of the black hole is exactly equal to the gravitational power of any other body of equal mass, just like the Sun
 isliye yadi surya ko samaan dravyaman vaale ek kalenidr ke parivartit kar diya jaye, grahon kii kakshaen aparivartit rahengi
 There are several types of black holes, which are identified by their specific size
 jab ve ek tara ke gurutvkarshan patan ke kaaran banate hai, unhen taarakeey kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 The mass of black holes formed at the center of galaxies can be several billion times the solar mass, they are called giant black holes because they are very large
 in donon paimaanon ke bich main kuch madhyavarti kalenidr bhi hote hai jinke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai hajaar gune tak hote hai
 Very low-mass black holes that are thought to have formed during the Big Bang in the early history of the universe may still exist and are called primordial black holes
 vartmaan main unka astitv abhi nishchit nahin he
 It is not possible to see a black hole directly

 The concept of a heavy body so incapable of escaping even light was revealed in a letter written by geologist John Michel to Henry Cavendish in 1783 and published by the Royal Society: 1796 main, ganitagya pierre-simon laplas ne apni kitaab exposishan du system du monde ke pehle or duusare sanskaran main isi vichaar ko badhaava diya tha 
 These "dark stars" were ignored in the nineteenth century, because then it was believed that light was a massless wave and therefore free from the effects of gravity
 aadhunik blike hole avadharana ke vipareet, aisa mana jaataa tha ki kshitij ke peeche kii vastu kaa patan nahin ho saktaa he
 In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he had already proved that gravity actually affects the speed of light
 kuch maheene baad, karl schvarjaschild ne ek bindu drabyaman or ek golakaar dravyaman ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa samaadhaan diya, yah dikhaate hue ki ek blike hole kaa astitv siddhanthata sambhav he
 The Schwarzschild radius is now known as the radius of the event horizon of non-rotating black holes, but this fact was not understood at the time, for example Schwarzschild himself did not consider it physical
 johanise droste nen, hendrick lorentz ke ek chaatr, swatantra rup se bindu dravyaman par schvarjaschild ke kuch maheenon ke baad aisa hi samaadhaan diya or iske gunon ke bare main bade paimaane par or adhik likhaa
 In 1930, astronomer Subramanian Chandrasekhar, using general relativity, calculated that the solar mass of a non-rotating body containing electron-generated matter would collapse if it exceeded 1
44
 unke tark kaa arthur edington dwaara virodh kiya gaya tha, jinka vishwaas tha ki koi vastu nishchit rup se is patan ko rokegi
 Eddington was partially right: a slightly dwarf white dwarf star above the Chandrasekhar range would transform into a neutron star after its collapse
 But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues predicted that due to the reasons given by Chandrasekhar, a star with more than three solar masses would collapse into a black hole
 oppenheimer or unke sah lekhakon ne shwarzschild nirdeshaank pranali kaa upyog kiya, jisane shwarzschild trigya par ganitiya vishistataa ko utpaadit kiya, duusare shabdon main, is sameekaran main istamaal kiye gaye kuch ghatak shwarzschild trigya par anant ho jate the
 This implies that the Schwarzschild radius was the boundary of a "bubble" in which time "stopped"
 yah baahar se dekhne waalon ke liye ek vaid bindu he, lekin andar girane waalon ke liye nahin
 Because of this feature, collapsed stars have been known as "frozen stars" for some time, as an external observer will see the star's surface frozen at the moment the star's collapse falls within the Schwarzschild radius
 Must be taking yah aadhunik blike holon kaa ek gyaat lakshan he, lekin is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki jame hue taare kii sataha kaa prakaash bahut jaldi redshifted ho jaataa he or blike hole ko bahut jaldi kaale rang kaa bana detaa he
 Many physicists were unable to accept the idea that time halts within the Schwarzschild radius and that people had no interest in the subject for 20 years
 1958 main, david phinkeistein ne edington-phinkelsten nirdeshaank prastut karte hue ghatana kshitij kii avadharana pesh kii, jisane unhen yah sabit karne main sakasham kiya ki schvarjaschild sataha r= 2 m ek vishistataa nahin he balki yah ek adarsh ekaladisha jhilli ke rup main kaary karata he: karnatmak prabhaav ise ek hi disha main paar kar sakate hai
 There was no significant contradiction in this and Oppenheimer's results, but it expanded it by adding a falling observer's viewpoint
 finkelstin samet, abhi tak ke saare siddhant keval gaiyr-chakrit blike holon ko cover karte the
 In 1963, Roy Kerr found the perfect solution for recurring black holes
 isaki chakrit singhulerity ek bindu nahin balki ek challa thi
 After some time, Roger Penrose is able to prove that singularity is found within all black holes
 1967 main, khagolavidon ne pulsar kii khoj kii or kuch varshon ke bheetar yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki gyaat pulsar, teji se chakrit neutron taare hi hai
 By that time, neutron stars were also confined to theoretical curiosity only
 isliye pulsar kii khoj ne un sabhi ati ghanatv vaali vastuon ke prati ruchi ko jaagrit kiya jinaki sanrachana gurutveey patan se hona sambhav hua hoga
 Physicist John Wheeler is widely credited with coining the term black hole in his public speech Our Universe: Known and Unknown in 1967, more cumulatively as an alternative to the "star that has gravitationally fallen to full collapse"
 in the form of
 haalanki, whealer ne jor diya tha ki sammelan main yah shabd kisi or ne gadha tha or unhone isko keval ek upyogi laghu-shabd ke rup main apanaaya
 The term was also cited in a letter to AAAS by Anne Ewing in 1964: jab kisi bade taare kaa puraa kaa puraa eendhan jal jaataa he to usamen ek jabardast visphot hota he jise supernova kehete hai
 The substance that survives after the explosion slowly starts to shrink and takes the form of a very dense mass called a neutron star
 agar neutron star bahut vishaal he to gurutvkarshan kaa dabaav itnaa hoga ki vah apane hi boj se simatata chalaa jayega or itnaa ghanaa ho jayega ki blike hole ban jayega or shyaam vivar, krishna gart yaa blike hole ke rup main dikhaai degaa
 The No Hair Theorem states that, once established, a black hole has only three independent physical characteristics: mass, charge, and angular momentum
 kinhin do blike hole kii in visheshtaon yaa parameter kii value yadi samaan ho to unke bich bhed karnaa kaaphi dushkar ho jaataa he
 These characteristics are special because they are visible from outside the black hole
 udhaaharan ke liye, anya kisi chargekrit vastu kii hi tarah ek chargekrit blike hole bhi samaan charge ko dur dhakelta he, is tathy ke baavjood bhi ki vidyut or chumbakeey balon ke liye jimmedaar kan photauns, aatanrik kshetra se bachakar nikal nahin pate hai
 The reason for this is the Gauss law, the total electric current exiting a large sphere is always the same and measures the total charge within the sphere
 jab charge blike hole main girtaa he, vidyut kshetra line bani rahati hai or kshitij se baahar kii or jhaankati rahati hai or ye kshetra line girane vaale sabhi padaarthon ke kul charge ko sangrakshit karti hai
 Electric field lines eventually spread uniformly across the surface of the black hole, establishing uniform field line density on the surface
 is sandarbh main blike hole ek aam condkating sphier kii tarah kaam karata he jisaki ek nishchit rasistivity hoti he
 Similarly, the total mass of a sphere containing a black hole can be found using the gravitational analog of the Gauss law, sitting far away from the black hole
 isi tarah, koniya gati ko bahut dur se, guruttviya-chumbakeey kshetra dwaara frem dreging kaa upyog karke mapa ja saktaa he
 When a black hole swallows a substance, its horizon oscillates like a wide membrane with friction, a transient system, until it is finally established
 yah vidyut-chumbakatv yaa gej siddhant jaise anya kshetra siddhant se alag he, jinamein kabhi bhi koi gharshan yaa rasistivity nahin hoti kyonki ve samay palatwaan hote hai
 Because a black hole eventually sets up in a final state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: very little about the gravity and electric field of the black hole
 Be able to provide information lupt jaankaree main ve sabhi chijen shaamil hai jinhen blike hole kshitij se bahut duuri se mapa nahin ja saktaa he, jaise kii, kul beryon number, laptone number, tathaa kan bhautikee ke lagbhag sabhi anya sangrakshit sudo-charge
 From here on, this behavior is so strange that it has been called the 'black hole information loss paradox'
 paaramparik rup se bhi blike hole main jaankaree kaa lupt hona kaaphi ajeeb he, kyonki saamaanya saapekshata ek lagrengian siddhant he jo upar upar se time reversible or hamiltonian prathit hota he
 But the black hole is not reversible due to the horizon: matter can penetrate into it but cannot escape
 ek aam blike hole main samay ke palatney ko white hole kaha gaya he, haalaanki entropy or kwantum makenix yah darshaate hai ki white hole blike hole ke samaan hi hai
 The no-hair theorem makes some assumptions about the nature of our universe and the substances involved, while other assumptions provide different conclusions
 udahaaran ke liye, yadi chumbakeey ekal-dhruvon kaa astitv he, jaisaa ki kuch siddhanton dwaara kaha gaya he, chumbakeey charge ek parmparik blike hole kaa chauthaa maapdand hoga
 Examples of the no-hair theorem are known for the following cases: ye apwaad kabhi kabhi asthir hote hai or kabhi kabhi blike hole se dur nai sangrakshit kwantum sankhyaon tak nahin le jate hai
 This theorem must apply in our four-dimensional and almost flat universe
 saralatam blike hole vah he jiskaa drabyaman he lekin na to charge he or na hi koniya gati
 These black holes are also known as Schwarzschild black holes, named after the physicist Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1915
 yah oinstin kshetra sameekaran ke liye khoja jane vaala pehla vishwasaneey or sateek samaadhaan tha or birkhophf prameya ke anusaar yah ekmaatr nirvaat samaadhaan he jo spherickli cymetric he
 This means that there is no visible difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and the gravitational field of any other spherical object of equal mass
 blike hole ke liye yah lokapriy dharna kii yah apane chaaron ore "prayek vastu ko andar khinchataa rahata he" keval iske kshitij ke paas hi satya baithti he; duuri par, iskaa bahari gurutvkarshan kshetra anivaary rup se saadhaaran baari pindon kii tarah kaa hi hota he
 More common solutions to black holes were discovered in the late 20th century
 reissner-nordastrom metric vidyut charge vaale blike hole kaa varnan karata he, jabaki kerr metric ek chakrit blike hole pradaan karata he
 The Kerr – Newman metric is generally the more prevalent stationary black hole solution, which describes both charge and angular momentum
 haalanki ek blike hole kaa dravyaman koi bhi positive mulya le saktaa he, charge or koniya gati dravyaman dwaara baadhya hote hai
 In natural units, the total charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} and the total angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} are expected to satisfy the following m dravyaman vaale ek blike hole ke liye
 The black hole that fills this disparity is called extreme
 asamanta kaa ulanghan karne vaale oinstin ke samikarnon ke samaadhaanon kaa astitv he, lekin unamem kshitij nahin he
 These solutions have naked specificity and are considered immaterial, because the cosmic censorship hypothesis rejects this specificity because of the overall gravitational collapse of real substances
 yah sankhyatmak anukritiyon dwaara samarthit he
 Due to the relatively large force of the electromagnetic force, black holes formed by the collapse of stars are expected to retain the neutral charge of the stars
 chakran ko compact vastuon kaa ek saamaanya gun mana gaya he or aisa prathit hota he ki blike hole ke pratyaashee binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 kii koniya gati apane adhiktam sambhav value ke kareeb he
 Black holes are generally classified according to their mass, independent of the angular momentum j { \ displaystyle j \ ,}
 The size of a black hole determined by the event horizon radius, or the Schwarzschild radius, is proportional to the mass m { \ displaystyle m \ ,}, jahaan r s h { \ displaystyle r_{sh} \ ,} schvarjaschild trigya he or m ⨀ { \ displaystyle M_{ \ bigodot }} surya kaa dravyaman he
 Thus the size and mass of a black hole are simply related, independent of rotation
 is kasuti ke anusaar, blike holon ko is prakaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he: The characteristic of a black hole is the appearance of the event horizon; a space of time beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer
 jaisaa ki saamaanya saapekshata ne bhavishyavaanee kii thi, dravyaman kii upasthiti antariksh-samay ko is prakaar vikrut kar detii he ki kanon ke maarg unhen us dravyaman kii taraf le jate hai
 This deformation becomes so powerful on the incident horizon of the black hole that there is no way to go out
