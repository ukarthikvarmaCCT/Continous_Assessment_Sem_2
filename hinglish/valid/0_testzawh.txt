 yah naam alfred vegener ke mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant kii vaigyanik charchaa main gadha gaya tha
 In his book, "the Origin of Continents and Oceans", he considered that all continents were part of a vast continent at one time, which he called "the continent", before subsequently disintegrating and flowing to their present places

 Many other constructions may also have occurred prior to Pangea

 The exact configuration and geodynamics history of Rodinia is not as well understood as that of Panotia and Pangea
 When the fragmentation of Rodinia occurred, it was divided into three pieces: the vast continent of proto-lauresia, the vast continent of proto-gondwana, and relatively Small Congo Cretan
 proto-lauresia and proto-gondwanaland were separated by the proto-tethys Ocean
 proto-loresia ke swayan vibhajit hokar alag-alag hone ke turant baad laurenshia, siberia or baltic mahadwipon kaa nirmaan hua
 Its rift also created two new oceans, the Iapetus Ocean and the Paleocean Ocean
 baltic laurenshia ke purv main or siberia laurenshia ke uttar-purv main sthit tha
 Around 600 ma, most of these oceans came back together to form Panotia, a relatively short giant continent consisting of a large amount of land near the poles and just a relatively small strip connecting the polar oceans near the equator
 isaki utpatti ke keval 60 million varsh ke baad, lagbhag 540 eme, cambrian yug kii shuruyaat ke kareeb panotia phir se vikhandit ho gaya jisase laurenshia, baltic or gondvanaa ke dakshini vishaal mahadweep kaa janm hua
 In the Cambrian period, the independent continent of Laurentia, which became North America, became located on the equator with delimited oceans bounded on three sides: the Panthalassic Ocean to the north and west, the Ipitus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east
 Around 480 MA in the oldest Ordovician, the small continent of Avalonia, a part of land that formed the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia, and England, was liberated from Gondwana and began its journey towards Laurentia
 baltic, laurenshia or evalonia sabhi ordovisian kaal ke ant tak ek saath mil gaye or is tarah ipitas mahaasaagar ke nikat ek chote mahadweep kaa nirmaan hua jise uramerica yaa loresia kaha gaya
 The North Appalachians also originated as a result of the collision
 Siberia is located near Euramerica with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents
 jab ye sabhi ghatnaayen ho rahi thim, gondvanaa dhire-dhire dakshini dhruv kii ore khisak gaya
 This was the first phase of Pangea's origin
 panzia kii utpatti kaa doosraa charan tha gondvanaa ke saath uramerica kii takkar
 silurian kaal tak, 440 eme, baltic ne pehle hi laurenshia se takaraakar uramerica kaa nirmaan kar diya tha
 Avalonia had not yet collided with Laurentia, and a remnant of the Ipitus Ocean, a sea route between them, was still shrinking as Avalonia slowly slid towards Laurentia
 is bich dakshini europe gondvanaa se khandit ho gaya or navgathit rek mahaasaagar ke paar uramerica kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or devonian main dakshini baltic se takaraa gaya, haalanki yah chota mahadweep pani ke neeche kii ek pattee ke rup main tha
 The Khanty Ocean, a branch of the Ipitus Ocean, was also shrinking from Siberia as an island island that collided with the eastern Baltic
 is dweepiya vrutt ke peeche ek nayaa sagar, ural mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Towards the end of the Silurian period North and South China moved away from Gondwana and began to move northward across the shrinking proto-tethys Ocean, with the new paleo-tethys Ocean opening at its southern tip
 devonian kaal main gondvanaa swayan uramerica kii ore badhane laga tha jiske kaaran rek mahaasaagar sikud rahaa tha
 In the early Carboniferous era, northwest Africa touched the southeastern coast of Euramerica, starting to form the Appalachian Mountains and the southern parts of the Meseta Mountains
 dakshini america uttar disha main dakshini uramerica kii ore bad gaya tha jabaki gondvanaa ke purvi bhaag bumadhya rekha se dakshini dhruv kii ore badhane lage the
 North China and Southern China were located on independent continents
 chota mahadweep kazakhstania madhya carbonipheras yug main siberia se takaraa gaya tha
 Western Kazakhstania collided with the Baltic at the end of the Carboniferous Era, causing them to cease contact with the Ural Ocean and causing them to originate in the western proto-tethys Ural mountains and the vast continent Lauresia
 This was the last stage of Pangea's origin
 is bich dakshini america dakshini laurenshia se takaraa gaya tha jisase rek mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya tha or epalachiyans evam auchita parvaton ke sabase dakshini hisse kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 By this time Gondwana was located near the South Pole and glaciers were formed in Antarctica, India, Australia, South Africa, and South America
 uttari china kaa hissaa carbonipheras yug ke ant tak siberia se takaraa gaya tha or is tarah proto-tethis mahaasaagar puri tarah se band ho gaya tha
 At the beginning of the Permian era, the Cimmerian Plate split off from Gondwana and began to move towards Lauresia, creating a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean at its southern tip, and closing the path to the plato-tethys Ocean
 zyaadaatar bhu-bhaag abhi bhi ekikrut hi tha
 In the Triassic period, Pangea moved slightly in the southwest direction
 cimerian plate ab bhi sikudte peleo-tethis ke paar ja rahi thi jo jurassic kaal ke madhya tak jari rahaa
 peleo-tethis pashchim se purv tak band ho gaya tha or is tarah cimerian orogeni kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Pangea looked like the letter "C" in English, which contained an ocean, the new Tethys Ocean, inside the Sea
 jurassic kaal ke madhya tak panzia main daraar pad gayi thi, iske vikhandan kaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 Fossil-evidence of Pangea includes the presence of similar and integral species found on continents that have now gone far
 udhaaharan ke liye, therapcid listrosoras ke jeevashm dakshin africa, bharat or australia main glosopteris flora ke sadasyon ke saath-saath paae jate hai jinka vistaar dhruviya vrutt se lekar bumadhya rekha tak hua hoga, agar mahadweep apni vartmaan sthitiyon main rahe honge; isi tarah mithe pani ke sarisrup mizosoras keval brazil or pashchimi africa ke taton ke sthaneey kshetron main paae jate hai
 Additional evidence of Pangea is found in the geology of the adjacent continents, including the matching of geological trends between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa
 carbonipheras kaal ke dhruviya barf kii parat ne panzia ke dakshini chor ko dhank liya tha
 Especially glacial collections and structures dating back to the same era are found on many different continents that may have been together in the Pangea continent
 dhruviya vichlan ke spasht margon kaa peleomagnetic adhyayan vishaal-mahadweep ke siddhant kaa bhi samarthan karata he
 Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; When rocks are formed, they absorb the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles are present relative to the rock
 chunki aavarti dhruvon kii ore chumbakeey dhruvon kaa jhukaav keval kuch hajaar varshon kii avadhi main hota he, ek spasht ausat dhruviya sthiti nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai hajaar varshon ke kai lava se maapan kaa ausat nikaala jaataa he
 Samples of sedimentary rocks and intrusive igneous rocks have a magnetic tilt which is usually an average of these 'similar shifts' in magnetic northward tilt as their magnetic fields do not immediately form as in the frosting lava

 The continuity of mountain ranges also provide evidence for Pangea
 iskaa ek udhaaharan epalchian parvat shrinkhalaa he jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america se lekar ireland, britain, greenland or scandinavia ke calladonids tak faili hui he
 Pangea had three major phases of fragmentation
 pehla charan praarambhik-madhya jurassic kaal main shuru hua tha jab panzia purv main tethis mahaasaagar se or pashchim main prashanth mahaasaagar se alag hona shuru hua, jisase antat vishaal mahadwipon loresia or gondvanaa kaa vikaas hua
 The rift that began to form between North America and Africa gave rise to many failed cracks
 a rift resulted in the creation of a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean
 atlantic mahaasaagar ek samaan rup se nahin khulaa tha; uttar-madhya atlantic main daraar bananaa shuru hua tha
 The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous
 loresia ne dakshinavart main ghoomana shuru kar diya tha, yah uttar main uttar america evam dakshin main uresia kii ore bad gaya
 The path of the Tethys Ocean was also closed due to the rise of Lauresia in a clockwise direction
 isi bich africa ke duusari taraf purvi africa, antarctic or madagascar ke nikatavarti hashiyon ke saath ek nayaa daraar bhi bananaa shuru ho gaya tha jisase dakshin-pashchimi hind mahaasaagar kii utpatti hui, yah bhi criteshas main khul rahaa tha
 The second important phase of the fragmentation of Pangea began in the early Cretaceous period, when the small giant continent Gondwana split into several continents
 lagbhag 200 eme main simriya mahadweep upar varnit ke anusaar uresia se takaraa gaya 
 haalanki simriya ke takaraane ke saath hi ek sabadakshan kshetra nirmit ho gaya tha
 This subduction zone was called the Tethyan Trench
 yah samudri khai sambhawatah tethian mid-oshan rij ke rup main upashakhit ho gaya tha, yah rij tethis mahaasaagar ke vistaar ke liye jimmedaar tha
 This probably caused the northward movement of Africa, India and Australia
 praarambhik kriteshs kaal main atlantic jo aaj kaa dakshin america or africa he, antat purvi gondvanaa se alag ho gaya tha jisase "dakshin bhartiya mahaasaagar" kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 In the Middle Cretaceous period, Gondwana disintegrated and opened the way to the South Atlantic Ocean as South America began to move away from Africa to the west
 dakshin atlantic ek samaan rup se viksit nahin hua tha; balki yah uttar se dakshin kii ore daraar ke rup main bana tha
 Also Madagascar and India began to break away from the Antarctic at the same time and move northward, opening the way to the Indian Ocean
 madagascar or bharat criteshas kaal ke ant main 100-90 eme main ek duusare se alag ho gaye the
 India continued northward towards Eurasia at a speed of 15 cm per year and closed the Tethys Ocean, while Madagascar stayed there and settled in the African Plate
 newjiland, new calladonia or jeelandia kaa shesh bhaag australia se alag hone laga tha or prashanth kii disha main purv kii ore bad rahaa tha or isane coral sagar or tasman sagar kaa rasta khol diya tha
 The third important and final phase of the fragmentation of Pangea was completed in the early Sinozoic era
 loresia us samay alag hua jab uttar america / greenland uresia se mukt ho gaya or lagbhag 60-55 eme main isane norway ke sagar kaa maarg khol diya
 atlantic or hind mahaasaagar kaa vistaar hona jari rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa maarg band ho gaya
 Meanwhile Australia split from the Antarctic and moved rapidly northward, just as India did more than 40 million years ago and is currently in a collision situation with East Asia
 australia or bharat donon is samay prati varsh 5-6 centimetre kii gati se purvottar disha main bad rahe hai
 The Antarctic has been in or near the South Pole since the origin of Pangea in about 280 MA
 bharat takreeban 35 eme kii shuruyaat main asia se takaraane laga tha jisase himalay kii orogeni kaa nirmaan hua or tethis kaa samudri maarg bhi antat band ho gaya; yah takkar aaj bhi jari he
 The African plate began to change its directions from west to northwest toward Europe and South America began to move northward, separating it from Antarctica and for the first time the entire ocean circulation around the Antarctic
 , Due to which the continent began to cool down rapidly and glaciers were formed
 Other significant events during the Sinozoic era included the opening of the Gulf of California, the rise of the Alps, and the formation of the Japanese sea

 In a climate of change when Emperor Napoleon III rebuilt Paris and started wars, the French art scene was dominated by the Académie da bucs-arts in the mid-19th century

 The sharp rejection of Manet's portrait by the jury, as well as the rejection of unusually numerous works that year, created excitement among French artists

 After witnessing the rejection of works in 1863, Emperor Napoleon III ordered that the public be allowed to decide on a task and the Salon da Refugeus was organized

 Another artist Johann Zangkind, who greatly influenced Monet and his comrades, refused to participate like Manet
 photographer nadaar ke studio main april 1874 main yojit unki pratham pradarshnee main kul 30 kalakaaron ne bhaag liya
 The reactions of critics were mixed, with Monet and Cézan having to face unpleasant attacks
 Critic and satirist Louis Leroy wrote a scathing review in the Le Sherivary newspaper, in which he named the artists, playing the words of Claude Monet's title impression, Sunrise, which became his identity
 uphaaspurn dhang se apane lekh ko da exibishan of da impreshnists sheershak dete hue, leroy ne ghoshan kii ki zyaadaatar monet kaa chitra ek rekhachitr he or ise mushkil se sampurna kaary kaha ja saktaa he
 He wrote as a dialogue between the audience, ! apane nirmaan dasha main walpaper us samudri drishy se adhik sampurna he
 The term "impressionist" quickly gained public support

 Degas mostly rejected it because he valued drawing more than colors and despised the practice of painting outdoors

 Edward Manet, despite his role as the leader of the group, never ceased to use black freely, nor ever participated in impressionist exhibitions

 There was a rift in the central group's cast, with Cézanne and later Rinoire, Cicely, Monet separating themselves from the group's exhibitions in order to present their work in the salon
 samooh main gilamin kii sadsyta jaise vishyon par matbhed utpann ho gaye, jise ayogy samajhane vaale manet or digas ke pratirodh ke viruddh pissaaro or sezan kaa samarthan praapt hua
 Degas invited Mary Cassatt to exhibit her work at the 1879 exhibition, but she called for differences by emphasizing the inclusion of jean-françois Rafael, Ludovic Lepic, and other realists who did not represent impressionist methods
 As a result, in 1880, the Impressionists were accused of "opening doors for the first coming Dabbers"
 1886 main samooh apane saath signac or surat ko pradarshnee ke liye aamantrit karne ke maamle par bant gaya

 French painters who led the way in Impressionism include the romantic painter Eugène Delacroix, who was the leader of the realist Gustave Corbett and Barbizon school painters such as Theodore Russo
 Impressionists learned a lot from the paintings of jean-baptiste-camille Corot and Eugene Bowdin, the style in which nature was portrayed, which was close to Impressionism
 prabhaavvaadiyon ne madhya-shatabdi main pravartit sise kii tubon main pehle se mishrit rangon kaa laabh uthaaya, jisase kalakaar, baahar or andar, donon jagah adhik sahaj rup se kaam kar sakate the
 The first painters individually grinded dry dyes and mixed them with linseed oil, creating their own colors, which were stored in animal bladder bags

 photographi ne prabhaavvaadiyon ko camere main kshan ko qaid karne ke liye prerit kiya, na keval paridrishy kii kshanbhangur roshni ko, balki logon ke dainandin jivan ko bhi
 The rise of the Impressionist movement can also be seen as part of the artists' response to the newly established medium of photography
 yatharth ko hu-ba-hu chitrit karne ke liye ek nayaa madhyam uplabdh karaane kii vajah se, sthir yaa nishchal chhaviyon ko grahan karnaa chitrakaaron ke liye ek chunauti ban gaya
 Initially the presence of photography, the nature-depiction and the ability of the artist to reflect reality began to damage
 donon, chitra or prakritik drishy vaale chitra kuch had tak kamazor or yatharth se dur lagane lage, chunki photographi ne "jeevant chhaviyon ko adhik kushalta or vishwasaneeyata ke saath pesh kiya"
 Despite this, photography actually inspired artists to seek different artistic expression, rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, and artists focused their attention on "the one thing they essentially photograph Could do better than that - that is, the original unrealism of the concept of the image, which was removed by photography, in the art form and Install "
 Impressionists expressed their perception of nature, rather than formulating the real reflection or reflection of the world
 isane kalakaaron ko unke dwaara apni "ruchi or vivek kii anivaary antarhit" bhaavana se dekhi gai vishaywastu ko chitrit karne kii chhot di
 Photography encouraged painters to highlight aspects of the picture medium, such as color, that were lacking in photography at the time; "impressionists presented a person-relative choice with a complete understanding of photographs first"

 in kalakaaron kii kritiyon ko kabhi-kabhi yon hi prabhaavvaadi kaha jaataa he, bhale hi ve prabhaavvaadi paddati se kaafii dur hon

 They believed in him as the de facto caliph of the Islamic Prophet, Muhammad
 umayad kii tarah abbasiyon ne bhi unko apni khilaafat ke liye ek bada khatra mana, kyonki shiao ne al-mamun ko atyaachaari ke rup main dekha, jo unke imaamon kii pavitra sthiti se dur tha
 Allah Ta'abatei writes in his book Shia Islam, that al-mamun called Imam al-riza to Khurasan to calm many Shi'ite rebellions around his government and prevent Shias and al-riza's relatives from rebelling against the government For the role of Crown Prince
 kyonki ek to isse ve apane hi imam se ladate; duusare, logon main imaamon ke liye aantarik lagaav khone kaa kaaran banataa, kyonki imam, al-mamun kii bhrasht sarkaar se judaa hote
 Third, he wanted to convince Shiao to believe that his government was not evil, because al-riz would come to power after Mamun
 or chauthi, vah khud ko shiyaon ke imam par kadi nigaah rakhana chahta tha, jisase ki al-mamun ke gyaan ke bina kuch bhi nahin ho sake
 "if this Khilafat is for you, then it is not permissible for you to take off the dress that Allah has given to you and give it to someone else
 agar khilaafat aapke liye nahin he, to aap mujhe al-ma'mun was repeatedly trying to show his offer in earnest and re-visit the Khilafat, and finally his real plan was to try to make his Crown Prince Ali al-riza when Imam al- Riza also denied this position, with Al Ma'mun threatening him that "your ancestor Ali was chosen by the second caliph to allow the six members to elect a third caliph
" In State Council, and ordered not to kill him comply with the six
 agar aap meri sarkaar main crown prince kii sthiti ko sweekaar nahin karte hai, to main usee tarah karuga
 "al-riza said that he would accept under the condition that none of the government's work would be his
 vah na to kisi ko niyukt karege, na hi khaarij karenge vah kanoon nahin banaaege, yaa kanoon paas karege vah keval naam main crown prince hoge
 al-ma'mun became happy that al-riza accepted and that they would stay away from his secrecy, and he too accepted the condition of the Imam
 al-mamun ne kaale abbasid jhande ko hare rang main bhi badal diya, jo shiyao kaa paaramparik mohammad ke jhande or ali kaa amama kaa rang tha
 He also ordered coins to be made with both the names of al-mamun and Ali al-riza
 al-riza was called Khorasan and reluctantly accepted the role of al-mamun's successor, haalanki, ek din, jab al-al-riza ek bhavy sabha main ek bhaashan de rahe the, unhone suna ki jayad ne logon ke saamne khud kii prashansa kii, kaha ki main or bhi bahut kuch hum
 Ali al-riza said to him: "he zayd, kya aapane kupha ke dukandaaro ke shabdon par bharosa kiya he or unhen logon tak pahunchaaya he? aap kis cheez ke bare main baat kar rahe hai? ali ebn abi talib or fatima zaharaa ke putr tabhi yogya or utkrisht hai jab wo allaah kii adesho, or apane aap ko paap or galati se dur rakhe
 Do you think you are like Musa Al Qadim, Ali ibn Hussain and other Imams? While they worked hard in the path of Allah and prayed to Allah in the nights, do you think you will get the benefits without pain? Be aware that if any one of us does a good deed, he will get twice the reward
 usne mohammad ke sammaan ko banaae rakhaa he yadi vah kuch bura vyavhaar karata he or ek paap karata he, to unhone do paap kiye hai
 One is that he did a bad deed like the rest of the people and the second is that he did not maintain the honor of Muhammad, o brother! Whoever obeys Allah is ours who is a sinner is not ours
 Allah said of the son of Noah, who cuts off a spiritual bond with his father, saying, "he is not from your lineage, if he Had i not been out of your lineage, i would have been and gave him salvation
 " Debat al-mamun was very interested in working on various sciences translated into Arabic

 Many of these have been recorded in collections of Shia hadiths, a version of the Quran written by al-riza now in the Qom Museum, Iran, Works al-risalah al-dhahabiyyah Main article: al-risalah al-dhahabiyahl-riylah al-dhahabiyyah There is a treatise on medical treatment and maintenance of good health, written according to the demands of Mamun
 ise vigyaan ke vigyaan main sabase adhik moolyawaan islamic sahitya mana jaataa he, or "golden granth" kaa paatr tha kyonki mine ne ise sone kii syaahi main likhe jane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Mourat al-ma'an thought that he would end the problems of Shia rebels by naming al-riza as his successor
 aakhirkaar al-riza ko is sthiti ko sweekaar karne ke liye raji karne main sakasham hone ke baad, al-mamun ne apni galati kaa ehsaas kiya, kyonki shiya ko or bhi lokapriyata praapt hui
 In addition, the Arab Party became furious in Baghdad when it was heard that al-ma'mun was not only appointed imam as his successor
 unhen dar tha ki samrajya unase le liya jayega
 Therefore, the Arab Party decided to overthrow Mamun and pledge allegiance to Ibrahim ibn al-mahdi, Mamun's uncle, so Mamun gave the Imam a poison

 Enchanted is Disney's first live-action / traditional animation mixed film since Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, although traditional-animated characters don't interact in the live-action environment in the same way as Rogers do in Rabbit , Although there are scenes in which live-action characters share the screen with a two-dimensional animated character, for example, a Which communicates with the drive-action Nathaniel cell Narissa is a Pakau pot

 Lima has tried to infuse every bit of Disney iconic imagery into the film that they could in the first ten minutes, and what they did in traditional cell animations like a pre-disney fairy tale like Slipping Beauty, Ciderella and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs As a tribute to the films based on
 puh hefatmp movie ke baad yah pehali digni film thi jise parmparik cell anemation kii visheshtaon ke saath america main parde par jari kiya gaya tha
 However, the film was significantly different from prior Disney films based on plot and the film clearly pays tribute to the very old Disney films such as Auld Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, The Swiss Family Robinson, Bone Voyage and Savage Sam
 chunki 1990 dashak ke ant main computer graphics ke teji se badhane ke kaaran adhikansh digni ke cell anemation kalakaar samaapt ho gaye, anemation kaa 13 minute ghar main puraa nahin kiya gaya tha lekin pasedna-aadhaarit swatantra company james bextor anemation main kiya gaya tha, jise ullekhneey agrani anemator james bextor dwaara shuru kiya gaya tha

 Other outdoor locations include Brooklyn Breeze and The Paterno, an apartment building along the curve, the quaint, gorge-colored, bordering Riverside Drive and 116th Street, which is home to the film's character Robert and Morgan Phillip

 However May admitted that it was "very difficult" because Iconic was performing with Disney characters, which had long held an image in the audience

 Her wedding attire at the beginning of the film and her modern ball gown at the end of the film are in stark contrast

 In order to make the waist appear thinner, her handwear is designed to be "extra puffy" and the skirt is as long as it could have been, including a petticoat and a 20-fold metal encasement of the frill

 Amy Adams, describing her experiences of wearing a wedding dress, described it as terrible, saying that "the entire weight of the clothes was on the butt, so sometimes i felt a bit of a stretch"
 gigelo ke vipareet, prince edward vaastavik duniya main parivartit nahin hota or james marden jisane edward kii bhoomika adaa kii he, uske liye keval ek poshaak kaa dizin kiya gaya tha
 The purpose of May was to "not let go of your madness in creating an outfit 


 so that it would never look beautiful
 The dress" also included unnecessary stretching of the chest, buttocks and thigh and torso joint areas, which Marsden Shapes equally in the animated character of "and" mudra - his back is straight, arms are high and never falling
 " i am delighted that Lima Susan "chose something more fashionable" with Quinn Narissa of Sarandon
 She decided to show her as a "runway woman", yet she wore "something like Disney" but was also a fashionista like "john Galliano or Thierry Mugler's design
" chunki narisa teen prakaar ke sanchaar madhyamon main dikhaai detii he: 2D anemeshan, live-ection or computer anemeshan, isiilie me ko sunishchit karnaa tha ki puri film main rang, aakaar or banaavat ke aadhaar par ek hi prakaar ke poshaak honi chahie
 narisa ke liye poshaak ek hi prakaar kaa tha, jo kii ek chamade kii cholii or skirt, jo ek "saanp" kii tarah dikhaai detaa he or saath hi saath ek gale kaa vastra tha

 Fellow composer Stephen Schwartz wrote the song for six songs, which was also composed by Menken
 menkan or shavartz ne ek saath pokahonts or da hanchbek of notra dame ke gaanon par kaam kiya he
 Menken joined the film in the early stages of film production and invited Schwartz to collaborate with him
 unhone kahani main jahaan geet sweekaarya the, aise sateek kshan kii khoj ke dwaara githlekhan prakriya kii shuruuaat kii
 Schwartz found that it is quite easy to justify Enchanted's situations with other live-action musical films in which characters get lost in songs because its concept "allows characters to sing songs that are significantly associated with the storyline happened
 " gijela jo teen gane gaati he vah purv ke digni filmon ko sanderbhit karata he
 The film's first song, "true Love Kish", during which Disney actresses express the joy of being loved, evokes and pays homage to the genres of animated films, titled I'm Wishing and a Dream is a wish your heart makes
 This was a challenge for Menken and Schwartz because the song had many prior concepts associated with it, it should have reflected the deadlines of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella
 tadnusaar, baad ke broadway style ke gaanon ke vipareet emi adams ne pehle gane kaa pradarshan opereta style main kiya
 Both "happy Working Song" and "that's How You Know" also pay tribute to the former Disney song

 To achieve this, Schwartz believed that he had to "take it a little further in terms of choice of words and a few songs" to maintain the classic Walt Disney sensibility
 However, Menken said that the song he wrote for Disney is always "a bit sarcastic"
 jaise-jaise film aage badhati he, vaise-vaise sangeet main atyadhik samakaleen shaileyon kaa upyog kiya gaya he, jise vayask geet "so close" or country / pop geet "evar evar after" main dekha ja saktaa he
 Five of the entire six songs written by Menken and Schwartz end the film

 Pip, a squirrel who can talk in the 2D world of Andalasia, but loses the ability to communicate in the real world, so he had to rely solely on facial and physical gestures
 iskaa arth yah tha ki anemetaron ko pip ke bhaawanaaon ko pip ke pradarshan ke saath-saath use is tarah bananaa bhi tha jiske madhyam se vah vaastavik gilahari kii tarah dikhaai de
 The team at Tippet began the animating process for Pip by carefully observing the live squirrel, filming it from "every imaginable angle", then using an image-like 3D computer graphics software Maya and Furocius Created Squirrel
 jab drishy prabhaav paryvekshak thomas shelesni ne pip kii pehla anemation nirdeshak kevin lima ko dikhalaayaa to ve aashcharyachakit ho gaye kyonki vah ek CG kairactor dikh rahaa tha or footage nahin lag rahaa tha
 To increase facial expressions, the fabricators combined the eyebrows with Pip, which is not the case with real squirrels

 On some occasions a small squirrel with a wire weapon was placed inside the scene

 Unlike Peep, Narissa Dragons was allowed to be a highly fictional character, despite being a living character and a classic Disney villain
 CG dregon dizin ek parmparik chinis dregon or susaan sarandon ke live-ection chudail par aanshik rup se aadhaarit tha
 The scene which depicts Narissa transferring from a woman to a dragon, uses a long pole instead of a laser pointer to direct an extra eyebrow

 La Weekly explained the film, describing it as "a kind of delight, entertaining for people of all ages that Hollywood has been working hard to revive in recent years but still They have not been able to do it ", while Variety's Todd mccarthy commented that" Enchanted is far more than a fully animated production of Disney, 60 By the decade of the decade most Hollywood films were aimed at the public - barring a few special austerities
 The simple goal is to woo, without any brokerage, without vulgarity, without any pop cascades, without any dose for craze and without them today
