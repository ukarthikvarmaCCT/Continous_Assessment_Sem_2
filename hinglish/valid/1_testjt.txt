 Interestingly, Whistler was initially irritated by this unknown Indian
 da study of indian bards main wislar ne ullekh kiya ki greater racket-tail drongo kii lambii punch main aantarik falak par weabing kii kami hoti he
 Salim Ali wrote that such inaccuracies have been extant from early literature and made it clear that this was wrong about the turning of the spinal cord
 shuru-shuru main wislar ek agyaat bhartiya dwaara galat surveykshan se naaraaz hue or jarnal ke sampadak esech pretor or sar reginald spence ko "ghamand" se bharaa hua ek patr likhaa

 Although Meinertzhagen's views about Salim were also critical, they also became friends

 Meinertzhagen used to write a diary from the days of the survey and Salim Ali reproduced it in his autobiography: 30

1937 'I am disappointed in Salim
 He is quite useless at anything but collecting
 He cannot skin a bird, nor cook, nor do anything connected with camp life, packing up or chopping wood
 He writes interminable notes about something-perhaps me


 Even collecting he never does on his own initiative

1937 'salim is the personification of the educated Indian and interests me a great deal
 He is excellent at his own theoretical subjects, but has no practical ability, and at everyday little problems is hopelessly inefficient 


 His views are astounding
 He is prepared to turn the British out of India tomorrow and govern the country himself
 i have repeatedly told him that the British Government have no intention of handing over millions of uneducated Indians to the mercy of such men as Salim:

 After Tehmina's death in 1939, Salim Ali began living with his sister Kammo and brother-in-law

 Ali was not very keen about the details of bird classification and taxonomy and is more interested in studying birds in the area
 arst mer ne riple ko shikaayat karte hue likhaa ki ali paryaapt namoonon ko ikattha karne main vifal rahe hai: "jahaan tak sangrah karne kii baat he mujhe nahin lagata ki ve kabhi shrinkhalaa ekatrikaran kii aavashyaktaaon ko samaj sake hai
 Perhaps you can explain it to him
 " swayan ali ne riple ko pakshi vargeekaran ke bare main shikaayat karte hue likhaa: Ali later wrote that his interest is in "living birds in the natural environment
" " Salim Ali's association with Sidna Dillon Ripley was oriented towards a number of bureaucratic problems

 In the 1971 Sundar Lal Hora Memorial Lecture and the 1978 Azad Memorial Lecture, he spoke about the importance and history of bird studies in India

 They were able to pave the way for the study of migration through the project to study the Kaysanur forest disease, a arthropod-borne virus that was similar to a Siberian form

 Ali had considerable influence on conservation related issues in post-independence India, especially through Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi

 Some historians noted that the approach used by Salim Ali and BNHS for conservation was undemocratic
 saalim ali ke kai vichaar apane samay ke mukhya dhara ke vichaaron se vipareet the
 One of the questions he was often asked was the collection of bird specimens, especially later in life when he was known for conservation-related activism
 haalaanki kabhi shikaar sahitya ke prashansak rahe ali ke vichaar shikaar ko lekar kade rahe lekin unhone vaigyanik adhyayan ke liye pakshi ke namoonon kaa sangrah jari rakhaa
 His own view was that the practice of wildlife conservation requires practicality and should not be based on a philosophy like non-violence
 unhone kaha ki yah moulik dharmik bhaavana bharat main pakshi adhyayan ke vikaas main ek baadha tha
 it is true that i despise purposeless killing, and regard it as an act of vandalism, deserving the severest condemnation
 But my love for birds is not of the sentimental variety
 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics
 – Ali :195 He grew up in a Muslim home and was taught to read the Quran in his childhood days without understanding Arabic
 apane vayask jivan main unhone use tiraskrit kiya kyonki unhone prarthana ko ek aadambarpurn abhyaas samajha or unhen "bade-buudhon ke paakhandee dikhaave" se khiz hoti thi

 Creator of an environment for conservation in India, your work over fifty years in acquainting Indians with the natural riches of the subcontinent has been instrumental in the promotion of protection, the setting up of parks and reserves, and indeed the awakening of conscience in all circles from the government to the simplest village Panchayat
 Since the writing of your book, the book of Indian Birds which in its way was the seminal natural history volume for everyone in India, your name has been the single one known throughout the length and breadth of your own country, Pakistan, and Bangladesh as the father of conservation and the fount of knowledge on birds
 Your message has gone high and low across the land and we are sure that weaver birds weave your initials in their nests, and swifts perform parabolas in the sky in your honor
 For your lifelong dedication to the preservation of bird life in the Indian subcontinent and your identification with the Bombay Natural History Society as a force for education, the World Wildlife Fund takes delight in presenting you with the second J

 Commonly cited data from patients affected by allergenic hypersensitivity to penicillin and / or carbapenems also interacted with cephalosporin, a result of a 1975 study that thoroughly considered the original cephalosporin, and subsequent "safety first
" "the policy meant that it was widely cited and considered to be applicable to all members of the group
 
 It is therefore generally stated that they are usually uncompensated in patients with a history of severe, early allergic reactions to penicillin, carbapenems, or cephalosporins

 First cephalosporins were designated as first-generation cephalosporins, while, later, more long-range cephalosporins were classified as second-generation cephalosporins
 Each new generation of cephalosporins has significantly higher gram-negative microbial properties than the previous generation

 However, the fourth-generation cephalosporin has the correct broad-spectrum function
 "pidiyon" main syphalosporin kaa vargeekaran aam taur par vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he, yadhyapi syphalosporin kaa sahi vargeekaran aksar galat hota he
 For example, the fourth generation of cephalosporins is not yet recognized in Japan

 Second-generation cephalosporins have a much more gram-negative broad-range, retaining some action against gram-positive cocci
 ve beta-lactames ke prati bhi adhik pratirodhi hote hai
 Second generation cephalosporins with antipyretic activity nimnlikhit sefrm ko bhi kabhi-kabhi dwitiya peedi ke syphalosporin ke saath samoohikrut kiya jaataa he: Third-generation cephalosporins have a much wider range of functional and increased activity against gram-negative microorganisms
 is samooh ke kuch sadasyon main gram-positive sookshmjivon ke viruddh ghati kriyasheeltaa hoti he
 They may be particularly useful in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections, although increasing levels of disseminated-broad-spectrum beta-lactamase are reducing the clinical utility of this class of antibiotics

 muharram islamic varsh yani hijri san kaa pehla maheenaa he
 It is also a Muslim festival
 hijri san kaa aagaaj isi maheene se hota he
 This month is considered one of the four holy months of Islam
 allaah ke rasul hazrat mohammad ne is maas ko allaah kaa maheenaa kaha he
 Also, the statement of keeping Roza in this month has been said
 mukhtaliff hadison, yani hazrat mohammad ke kaul va amal se muharram kii pavitrataa va isaki ahmiyat kaa pataa chalata he
 Likewise, Hazrat Muhammad once referred to Muharram and called it the month of Allah
 ise jin chaar pavitra maheenon main rakhaa gaya he, unamem se do maheene muharram se pehle aate hai
 These two months are Jikada and Jilhijj

 While saying this, nabi-e-karim Hazrat Muhammad added one more thing that just as the most important namaz after the obligatory namaz is performed, similarly after Ramadan, the best roses are from Muharram
 islamic yani hijri san kaa pehla maheenaa muharram he
 It is a matter of coincidence that today this aspect of Muharram is out of the eyes of the common man and should pray to Allah in this month whereas prophet-islam kept fast in this month and attracted the attention of his companions
 is bare main kai pramanik hadisen maujuud hai
 Ibadats going on the 9th of Muharram have also been described as a great cause
 hazrat mohammad ke saathi ibne abbaas ke mutabik hazrat mohammad ne kaha ki jisane muharram kii 9 taarikh kaa rojaa rakhaa, uske do saal ke gunaah maaf ho jate hai tathaa muharram ke ek roje kaa sawab 30 rojon ke baraabar miltaa he
 Goya should be fasting in the month of Muharram

 aashura ke din hazrat rasul ke navaase hazrat imam hossain ko or unke bete gharavaale or unke sathiyon ko kerbala ke maidan main shahid kar diya gaya tha
 Muharram is a major festival of people who believe in the religion of Islam

 brahma apane teen siron se vedapth karte tathaa do sir se veda ko gaaliyaan bhi dete jisase krodhit ho shiv ne unka ek sir kaat diya
 Brahma was the father of Daksha
 at: daksh krodhit ho gaya or shiv se badla lene kii baat karne laga
 But this view is fragmented by other authentic references
 shrimadbhagwatmahapurana main spasht varnit he ki janm ke samay hi brahma ke chaar hi sir the
 According to another opinion, despite Shakti himself being prophetically said to be the wife of Lord Shiva himself, Daksha did not consider Shiva to be in accordance with Sati
 isliye unhone sati ke vivaah-yogya hone par unke liye swayamvar kaa aayojan kiya tathaa usamen shiv ko nahin bulaayaa
 Still Sati put Varmala on the earth by saying 'shivaaya Namah' and after appearing there, Lord Shiva took the Varmala and went to Kailash, making Sati his wife
 is prakaar apni ichha ke viruddh apni putree sati dwaara shiv ko pati chunane ke kaaran daksh shiv ko pasand nahin karte the
 The third opinion is most prevalent
 iske anusaar prajapatiyon ke ek yajna main daksh ke padhaarney par sabhi devataaon ne uthakar unka sammaan kiya, parantu brahma ji ke saath shivaji bhi baithe hi rahe
 Daksha felt insulted by Shiva for not being respected by him as his son, that is, he was like a son, and he used his hatred towards Shiva and henceforth cursed him not to part with the gods in the yagya
 
 is prakaar in donon kaa manomalinya ho gaya
 After the said event, Prajapati Daksha conducted a huge yagna in his capital Kankhal, in which he did not invite his Jamata Shiva and daughter Sati to come to the yagna
 shankar ji ke samajhane ke baad bhi sati apane pita ke us yajna main bina bulaaye hi chali gayi
 In the sacrificial place, Daksha Prajapati insulted Sati and Shankar
 apmaan na sah paane ke kaaran sati ne tatkaal yajyasthal main hi yogagni se swayan ko bhasma kar diya
 On receiving the news of Sati's death, Lord Shankar produced Virabhadra and caused the sacrifice of that yajna by him
 virbhadra ne purv main bhagavan shiv kaa virodh tathaa uphaas karne vaale devataaon tathaa rishiyon ko yathayogy dand dete hue daksh prajapati kaa sir bhi kaat daalaa
 Later on Lord Brahma prayed by Lord Brahma, Lord Shankar got Daksha Prajapati in exchange for his head and provided the goat head with his yagya
 daksh-yajna-vidhwans kii katha ke vikaas ke spashtatah teen charan hai
 The first phase of this story is in the Shantiparva of Mahabharata
 katha ke is praathmik rup main bhi daksh kaa yajna kankhal main hua tha iskaa samarthan ho jaataa he
 There is no clear mention of yagna in Kankhal here, but in the country of Gangadwar, there is a mention of Yajna and Kankhal comes under Gangadwar
 is katha main daksh ke yajna kaa vidhwans to hota he parantu sati bhasma nahin hoti he
 In fact, Sati lives with her husband Lord Shankar on Kailash and is extremely distraught when her father Daksha does not participate in the invitation and yagya
 unki vyakulata ke kaaran shivaji apane mukh se virbhadra ko utpann karte hai or vah ganon ke saath jaakar yajna kaa vidhwans kar daalata he
 However, neither Virbhadra beheads nor consumes Daksha
 swaabhaavik he ki bakre kaa sir jodne kaa prashn hi nahin uthta he
 In fact, in this story, it is said to cut off the head of 'yajna' i
e
 completely destroy the 'yajna', which was added in later stories by cutting the head of 'daksha'
 is katha main daksh 1008 naamon ke dwaara shivaji kii stuti karata he or bhagavan shiv prasann hokar unhen vardaan dete hai
 The second phase of the development of this tale is described from the Shrimad Bhagavat Maha Purana to the Shiva Purana
 isamen sati hathpurvak yajna main sammilit hoti he tathaa kupit hokar yogagni se bhasma bhi ho jaati he
 It is natural that when Sati is consumed in Yogagni, from where will her corpse be saved! Therefore, there is no question of Shiva's wandering etc
 with his corpse
 aisa koi sanket katha ke is charan main nahin miltaa he
 In this story, Virbhadra originates from Shiva's jata and burns Daksha's head
 parinamswaroop use bakre kaa sir joda jaataa he
 The third phase of the development of the story is described in the subpuranas like Devipuran
 jisamen sati jal jaati he or daksh ke yajna kaa virbhadra dwaara vidhwans bhi hota he
 Here Virbhadra originates from the third eye of Shiva and the head of Daksha is also cut
 phir stuti karne par shiv ji prasann hote hai or daksh jivit bhi hota he tathaa virbhadra use bakre kaa sir jod detaa he
 However, here the Puranikars further increase the story and later Lord Shiva gets the body of Sati safely and resplendently found in the Yajnashala itself
 tab us laash ko lekar shivaji veikshipt kii tarah bhatakate hai or bhagavan vishnu kramshah khand-khand rup main chakra se laash ko katate jate hai
 In this way, 51 Shakti Peethas are formed by falling of different parts of the corpse at different places
 spasht he ki katha ke is tisare rup main aane tak main sadiyon yaa sahasrabdiyon kaa samay laga hoga
 In this way, the parts of Sati's body and the ornaments that were worn, wherever they fell, Shakti Peethas came into existence
 shaktipeethon kii sankhya vibhinn granthon main bhinn-bhinn bataayi gayi he
 The number of Shaktipeeths in Tantra Chudamani is stated to be 52
 devibhagwat main 108 shaktipeethon kaa ullekh he, to devigita main 72 shaktipeethon kaa zikr miltaa he
 51 Shaktipeeths are discussed in Devipuran

 The biggest difference between the gimmick and the farce is believed to be that while the farce mostly deals with religious themes and is displayed a little seriously, the gimmick of the gimmick is based on love and heroism and blends satire and tension
 Let's go

 The high-ranking people of the society considered it 'cheap' and 'vulgar' but this folk art flourished
 adhiktar samikshakon kaa maananaa he ki 'nautanki swang style kaa hi ek viksit rup he'

 isi tarah, 'sultanaa daaku' kii nautanki isi naam ke uttar pradesh ke bijanour zile main hue ek daaku kii kahani bataati he
 During the freedom struggle of India, there were many gimmicks on that subject, which inspired the common people to join this struggle
 aajkal dahez-kupratha, aatankwaad or sampradayik ladaai-jhagadon ke viruddh nautankiyan dekhi ja sakati hai
 To maintain audience interest, gimmicks often contain certain elements of courtship that can also be used for obscenity
 isliye bahut si ashleel nautankiyan bhi dedh-sau saal se chalati aa raheen hai, jis se aksar nautanki kii style badnaam bhi hoti ai he
 Traditionally, in order to make money in gimmicks, it was necessary to never let the audience get bored, so most gimmicks were made by combining events of 10 minutes or less in a sequence that would interest the audience in each part
 Attempts to maintain

 In Nautanki, the practice of mixing poetry and common colloquialism has been there from the beginning

 In words such as 'khairat' and 'khuda', the pronunciation of the pointed 'kh' is slightly different from the pointless 'kh' and is similar to words like 'bad' and 'buy'

 jyon-jyon sabhyataa tathaa jansankhya badhati gai tyon tyon susajjit chikitsaalayon tathaa susangathit chikitsa vibhaag kii aavashyaktaa bhi prathit hone lagi
 Therefore, the evidence of opening of such hospitals by the government and the people inspired by service is found in history
 hamaare desh main dur- dur ke gaanvon main bhi koi na koi aisa vyakti hota tha, chaahe vah ashikshit hi ho, jo rogiyon ko dawa detaa or unki chikitsa, karata tha
 After this, hospitals in tehsils and districts were built in modern times where intimate and outdoor departments were arranged
 aajkal bade bade nagaron main aspataal banaae gaye hai, jinamein bhinn-bhinn chikitsa vibhaagon ke liye visheshgy niyukt kiye gaye hai
 There are large hospitals affiliated with each medical education institution and each department is under a specialist, who is also the teacher of that subject in the college
 aajkal yah praytn kiya ja rahaa he ki gaanvon main bhi prayek paanch mile ke kshetra main chikitsa kaa ek centre avashya ho
 The requirements of modern hospitals have become very specific and planning them is also a specific skill or discipline
 prayek aspataal kaa ek bahirang vibhaag or ek antarang vibhaag hota he, jinka nirmaan vahaan kii janata kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 Only outpatients are treated in outpatients
 ve aushadhi lekar yaa maraham pattee karwaakar apane ghar chale jate hai
 There is no provision for patient stay in this department
 yah vibhaag nagar ke bich main hona chahie jahaan janata kaa pahunchnaa sugam ho
 Along with this, there should be an emergency department where first aid can be done to the affected patients at least immediately
 aadhunik aspataalon main is vibhaag ke bich main ek bada cameraa, jisamen rogi pratiksha kar sake, banaaya jaataa he
 It has the place of "inquiry" on one side and the candidate's office on the other, where the name, address etc
 of the patient is written and from where the patient is referred to the appropriate department
 abhyarthak kaa vibhaag uttam prakaar se, sab suvidhaon se yukt, banaaya jaae tathaa usamen karmchaariyon kii paryaapt sankhya ho, jo rogi ko upyukt vibhaag main pahunchaaen tathaa uski anya sab prakaar kii sahaayta karen
 The outside department should have the following subdivisions: 1
chikitsa, 2
 shalya, 3
 vyaadhiki, 4
 streerog, 5
 viklang, 6
 shalakya, 7
 netra, 8
 danta, 9
 kshayrog, 10
 charm or ratijrog 11
ballrog or 12
 aapatti anuvibhag Each subdivision should have a specialist, its house-surgeon, a clerk, a technician, a chamber-child servant and an orderly
 prayek anuvibhag nidanvishesh tathaa chikitsavishesh ke aavashyak yantron or upkarnon se susajjit hona chahie
 The laboratory of the Department of Medicine should have all the equipment for routine examinations, so that it can be used to assist in diagnosis by doing simple necessary examinations
 vishesh parikshaon tathaa visheshgyon dwaara pariksha kiye jane ke pashchaat hi rog kaa nidaan ho saktaa he
 And the disease can be diagnosed only after the disease is fixed and the treatment starts only after the disease is fixed
 atev rogi ko adhik samay tak pratiksha kerani padati he
 As a result, proper seating and other facilities should be managed
 chikitsa - chikitsa sambandhi kaary do bhaagon main vibhakt kiye ja sakate hai: nuskhe ke anusaar oshadhi dekar rogi ke vidaa karnaa or saadhaaran shastrkarm, udvartan, taapachikitsa aadi kaa aayojan karnaa
 For this reason, each outdoor department should have an operation theater with well equipped, skilled assistants and nurses
 uddhartan, anya bhautikeechikitsa-prakriyaaon tathaa prakaash-chikitsaaon ke liye unke upyukt vibhaagon ko uchit prabandh hona chahie
 By this, the patient can be freed from the intimate department by giving quick neurosis and there will be more space and time available for the treatment of heterogeneous patients
 aapad-anuvibhag - bahirang vibhaag kaa ek aavashyak ang aapadnuvibhag he
 Employees should be appointed to work non-working 24 hours
 nivasee sarjan, nurse, ardli, balsevak, mehtar aadi itani sankhya main niyukt kiye jaaen ki choubison ghante rogi ko unki seva uplabdh ho sake
 In this department, treatment of concussion will have to be done exclusively
 is kaaran is chikitsa ke liye sab prakaar ke aavashyak upkarnon tathaa aushadhiyon se yah vibhaag susajjit hona chahie
 The life of the patient depends on its readiness and efficiency
 atev yahan ke karmchaaree apane kaary main nipun hon, tathaa sabhi prakaar kii vyavastha yahan ati uttam honi chahie
 Glucose, plasma, blood, thermodynamic devices, stimulant drugs, injections, etc
 should be available in sufficient quantities
 yahan eks-i kaa ek chalayantra bhi hona chahie, jisase asthibhang, asthi or sandhi sambandhi vikrutiyaan phuffus ke ro ga yaa hriday kii dasha dekhakar rog kaa nishchay kiya ja sake
 It is necessary to have complete arrangements for disinfection of instruments and clothing etc
 yadi yah vibhaag kisi shikshasanstha ke adheen ho to vahaan ek vyaakhyaan yaa pradarshan kaa cameraa hona aavashyak he, jo itnaa bada ho ki samast vidhyaarthee vahaan ek saath baith saken
 There should also be separate rooms for the teachers to rest and keep the teaching material and the employees working at night
 saare vibhaag main uddhavan paddati dwaara shodhit honevaale shauchasthaan hone chahie
 Separate separation of such toilet facilities is necessary for employees and patients
 is vibhaag kaa sanghathan karte samay vahaan honevaale kaary, kaaryakartaaon kii sankhya, prayek anuvibhag main chikitsaarthi rogiyon kii sankhya, unki shaareerik aavashyaktaayen tathaa bhavishya main hone vaale anumit vistaar, in sab baton kaa purna dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Everyday experience is that the building which is constructed today becomes inadequate due to workload in a short time
 pehle se hi iskaa vichaar kar lenaa uchit he
 It is clear from what has been said above that a lot of expenditure has to be incurred in the outdoor department
 aadhunik samay main chikitsa kaa siddhant hi yah he ki koi chaahe kitna hi nidhan kyon na ho, use uttam se uttam chikitsa ke aayojanon tathaa oshadhiyon se apni nirdhantaa ke kaaran vanchit na hona pade
 How much money is needed to fulfill this purpose can be easily estimated
 sarkaar, deshpremi or srisampann vyaktiyon kii sahaayta se is uddeshy kii purti asambhav na honi chahie
 In the intimate department, there is a provision of medical treatment by looking at the odd diseases and the condition of the patient
 praant, nagar yaa kshetra kii aavashyaktaaon ore vahaan uplabdh aarthik sahaayta ke anusaar hi chote yaa bade vibhaag banaae jate hai
 Intimate divisions are made, ranging from few patients to thousands of patients
 yah sab paryaapt dhanrashi ore karmchaariyon kii uplabdhi par nirbhar he
 Many times funds are not available, but suitable employees are not available
 hamaare desh or uttar pradesh main upachaarikaon kii itani kami he ki kitne hi aspataal khaali pade hai
 The reason for this is the disinterest in the treatment system of middle-class families
 kuch saamaajik kaarnon se upachaarikaon ko bahut acchhee drushti se nahin dekha jaataa; yah nitant bhramamoolak he
 There is no justification in such perceptions of the public
 antarang vibhaag main bhartee kiye jane ke pashchaat rogi kii vyavasthaaon kaa purna anveshan visheshgy apane sahaayakon tathaa vyaadhiki prayogshaala, eks-re vibhaag aadi ke sahyog se karata he
 For this reason, it is necessary to keep these departments equipped with the latest equipment
 shalya vibhaag ke liye iskaa mahatv vishesh rup se adhik he jahaan karmchaariyon kaa daksh hona or unamem parsparik sahyog safalataa ke liye anivaary he
 Everyone needs support from the room to the child servant to the specialist surgeon
 keval ek nurse kii asaavadhaanee se sara shastrkarm asafal ho saktaa he
 X-rays and best operation theater are the most essential parts of this department
 utam upachaar sari sanstha kii safalataa kii kunjee he; isi se aspataal kaa naam yaa badanaami hoti he
 Hospitals are the most important part of modern medicine
 is kaaran uttam shikshit upachaarikaon ko taiyaar karne kii aayojana sarkaar kii ore se kii gai he
 The construction of modern hospitals has become a specialized art of engineering
 aspataalon ke nirmaan ke liye rajya ke medical vibhaag ne adarsh maanchitr bana die hai, jinamein aspataal kii vishesh aavashyaktaaon or suvidhaon kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 Appropriate maps have been prepared for all types of small and big hospitals according to which the required expansion hospitals can be built
 aspataal banane ke purv yah bhalee-bhanti samaj lenaa uchit he ki aspataal kharch karanevaali sanstha he, dhanoparjan karanevaali nahin
 a large amount of money is needed initially to build a modern hospital; The cost of running him regularly is a bigger question
 bina iskaa prabandh kiye aspataal bananaa bhul he
 Due to lack of funds, there is a lot of difficulty going forward and the following objectives of the hospital cannot be fulfilled: natvahan kaamaye raajyan na swarg napunarbhavam
 Kamae dushkaptanam pranamamartinashanam
 
 Our country is very wide and its population is very large
 usee prakaar yahan chikitsa sambandhi prashn bhi utane hi vistrut or jatil hai
 Then the poverty of the people and lack of education makes this question even more complicated
 is kaaran chikitsaprabandh kii aavashyaktaaon ke adhyayan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se kai baar cametiyaan niyukt kii gai hai
 According to the recommendations made by the Bhor committee, there should be a hospital with 75 doctors for every 10 to 12 thousand population, with six doctors and six doctors and other staff
 yah praathmik ang kehalaayegaa
 a secondary organ is also required on 20 such primary organs
 yahan ke aspataal main 1,000 antarang rogiyon ko rakhane kaa prabandh ho
 Here specialists of every medical branch should be appointed and the hostesses and other staff should also be there
 eks-re, rajyakshma, surgery, chikitsa, vyaadhiki, prasuti, asthichikitsa aadi sab vibhaag pruthak-pruthak hon
 Beyond the secondary organs and larger, be it the department or organ of the central or district, where all types of therapies are arranged, which are not managed in the secondary lead hospital
 yahi par sabase bade sanchaalak kaa bhi sthaan ho
 The entire permitted expenditure of this event is more than the total income of the Government of India
 is kaaran yah yojana abhi tak karyanvit nahin ho saki he
 Nowadays, due to increase in population and number of patients accordingly, construction of special type of hospitals has become necessary
 pratham aavashyaktaa chhutahe rogon ke pruthak aspataal banane kii hoti he, jahaan keval chhutahe rogi rakhe jate hai
 Similarly, a separate hospital is necessary for Rajakshma patients
 maansik rog, asthirog, ballrog, streerog, prasutigrih, viklaangata aadi ke liye bade nagaron main pruthak aspataal aavashyak hai
 It is necessary to create at least different required departments in the same hospital in small towns
 in aspataalon kaa nirmaan bhi unke aavashyaktaanusaar bhinn-bhinn prakaar se karnaa hota he or usee prakaar vahaan ke karmchaariyon kii niyukti kii jaati hai
 The government has prepared a map of all these types of hospitals and a list of all the requirements there, according to which all types of hospitals can be built
 bade nagaron main, jahaan aspataalon kii sadaa kami rahati he, ugr avasthaa se mukt hone ke pashchaat, durbal swasthonmukh vyaktiyon tathaa atyadhik samaysadhay chikitsawale rogiyon ke liye pruthak vibhaag-rugnalay -bananaa aavashyak he
 This reduces a lot of the difficulty of the hospitals and makes it easy to find places to keep patients of old age
 aajkal samajaseva chikitsa kaa ek ang ban gai he or dinon-din chikitsaalay tathaa chikitsa main samajasevi kaa mahatv badhata ja rahaa he
 In addition to medicine, it is the job of a philanthropist to study the mental, family and social conditions of the patient and to overcome the patient's attentive difficulties
 rogi kii rogotpati main uski rugnavastha main uske kutumb ko kin kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he tathaa rog se yaa aspataal se rogi ke mukt ho jane ke pashchaat koun-si kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa, unka rogi par kya prabhaav hoga aadi rogi ke sambandh kii ye sab baaten samajasevi ke adhyayan or upachaar ke vishay hai
 If, after getting rid of the disease, the person is unable to cultivate family due to financial problems, then he can become diseased again
 rogkaal main uske kutumb kii aarthik samasya kaise hal ho, iskaa prabandh samajasevi kaa kartavya he
 Every kind of problem a social worker has to solve
 isse samajasevi kaa chikitsa main mahatv samajha ja saktaa he
 As much as the treatment or treatment is needed in the event of severe disease, after immunization, social service is equally important in protecting the health of the person and making life useful
 ayurvaigyanik shikshasansthaaon main aspataal-ayurvaigyanik shiksha sansthaaon main chikitsaalayon kaa mukhya prayojan vidhyaarthiyon kii chikitsa-sambandhi shiksha tathaa anveshan he
 For this reason, the principles of construction of such hospitals are somewhat different
 inamen prayek vishay kii shiksha ke liye bhinn-bhinn vibhaag hote hai
 In these, according to the number of students, proper place is required to keep patients, in which necessary beds can be kept
 saath hi shayyaon ke bich itnaa sthaan chhodana padataa he ki shikshak or uske vidhyaarthee rogi ke paas khadey hokar uski parriksha kar saken tathaa shikshak rogi ke lakshanon kaa pradarshan or vivechan kar sake
 For this reason more space is required for such hospitals
 phir, prayek vibhaag ko purnataya aadhunik yantron, upkarnon aadi se susajjit karnaa hota he
 They are essential for education
 atev aise chikitsaalayon ke nirmaan or saganthan main saadhaaran aspataalon kii apeksha bahut adhik vyay hota he
 Teachers and staff are also appointed only among the best scholars, who are recognized persons of their subjects
 atev aise chikitsaalay chalaane kaa nityprati kaa vyay adhik hona swaabhaavik aisi sansthaaon ke nirmaan, sajja tathaa karmchaariyon kaa puraa byoraa indian medical council ne taiyaar kar diya he
 This council controls the educational institutions across the country
 jo sanstha uske dwaara nirdhaarit maapdand tak nahin pahunchati usko council manyata pradaan nahin karti or vahaan ke vidhyaarthiyon ko ucch parikshaon main baithne ke adhikaar se vanchit rahanaa padataa he
 This council has done a lot of work in raising the standard of education
 aise aspataalon main vishesh prashn paryaapt sthaan kaa hota he
 Both the size and the number of rooms have to be kept high
 phir, prayek vibhaag kii aavashyaktaa, vidhyaarthiyon or shikshakon kii sankhya aadi kaa dhyaan rakhkar chikitsaalay kii yojana taiyaar kerani padati he
