 Agoraphobia can occur where there is such a fear of a panic attack that is not expected to escape in any way
 Alternatively, social anxiety problems may also be a fundamental cause
 jiske parinamswaroop, janaatank se peedit vyakti, saarvajanik or / aparichit sthanon se bachate hai, vishesh kar vishaal, khule, khaali sthaan se, jaise shopping mal yaa hawaii adde, jahaan chupane ke liye kuch jagahen hoti hai
 In many cases, the victim may be confined to his or her home, where he or she experiences difficulty moving elsewhere from this safe place
 yadhyapi zyaadaatar maamalon main saarvajanik sthanon kaa hi dar hota he, yah ab mana jaataa he ki janaatank kaa vikaas bhayakrant hamale kii jatiltaaon ke rup main hota he
 However, evidence exists that a unilateral causal relationship between spontaneous panic attack and agoraphobia in DSM-IV may be incorrect
 america main 18 se lekar 54 varsh ke bich ke kareeb 3
2 million vayask yaa 2
2% log janaatank se grasit hai
 Agoraphobia, which should not be considered agoraphobia, is a condition where the victim becomes distraught in an environment that is unfamiliar to him or where the victim feels that he or she does not have control in their hands
 is chintaa ko sakriy karne main vyapak khule sthaan, bheed, yaa yatra shaamil ho sakate hai
 Agoraphobia is often associated with fear of a social problem, but not always, as agoraphobic fear begins with panic attacks and distress in public
 ise kabhi-kabhi 'saamaajik janaatank' bhi kaha jaataa he jo saamaajik chintaa vikaar kaa ek prakaar ho saktaa he jise kabhi-kabhi 'saamaajik bhay' bhi kaha jaataa he
 However, not all agoraphobia is social
 janaatank se grasit kuch logon main khuli jagahon kaa bhay hota he
 Agoraphobia is defined as "a phobia, sometimes a terrible phobia, by those who have suffered one or more panic attacks
 " aise maamalon main, peedit ko ek vishesh sthaan kaa dar hota he, kyonki pichhali baar usee sthaan par usne bhayakrant hamale kaa anubhav kiya tha
 To avoid having to face another panic attack, the victim becomes frightened or refrains from going to that place
 is prakaar ke peedit ko ab janaatank se grasit mana jaataa he
 Sometimes victims can try in every way to avoid the place where the first panic attack was encountered
 is dhang se varnit janaatank, vastav main bhayakrant vikaar ke nidaan nirmaan ke samay peshewar lakshan jaanch hai
 Symptoms such as extremely compulsive compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder can also be due to agoraphobia, basically any unfounded fear that prevents a person from going out can cause symptoms
 yatra duuri se sambandhit janaatank main multah sakhti ke teen str hote hai jo ki vartmaan main maansik vikaron ke naidanik sankhyikeey minial main anternihit nahin hai
 The first level agoraphobia involves an imaginary fear or a real panic attack as a result of a journey beyond the normal perimeter of an area where it lives, such as a large city or country
 dwitiya str kii janaatank main ek pados yaa awasaiya jile kii saamaanya paridhi jahaan vah rahata he, uske pare yatra ke parinaam ke rup main ek kalpanaatmak bhay yaa vaastavik bhayakrant hamalaa shaamil hota he
 Third level agoraphobia involves an imaginative fear or a real panic attack as a result of going outside the boundaries or premises of one's residence
 is shrenee ke adhikansh peedit baraamde, balakani, chat, praangan yaa angan ke baahar chalane main sakasham hote hai, lekin tisare str ke alpsankhyak peedit isse baahar jane se darate hai
 It is not uncommon for a person with second-level and third-level agoraphobia to suffer from Temporal Separation Anxiety Disorder especially when other members of that household move temporarily, such as parents or spouses
 Or a person suffering from agoraphobia is alone at home
 
 is tarah kii asthaayee paristhitiyon ke parinamswaroop chintaa yaa bhayakrant hamale main vruddhi ho sakati he
 Another public associative disorder of agoraphobia is the fear of death - the fear of death
 So the thought of dying often increases the anxiety level of a person suffering from agoraphobia, which they consciously or unknowingly eventually associate with mortal emotional reassurance and safety zones and thoughts of eventual separation from loved ones, even for them
 Who otherwise believe in some form of post-life existence spiritually
 jis prakaar janaatank purushon main aam rup se hota he usase lagbhag dugane str par mahilaon main hota he

 The branches of social science, especially the aspect of geography which has moved towards interest, can be considered as a spatial phenomenon
 isi tarah kaa ek drushtikon, janaatank ke vikaas ko aadhuniktaa se jodta he
 Most people who go to mental health experts develop agoraphobia after the onset of panic disorder
 Agoraphobia can be better understood as an adverse behavioral consequence of a frequent panic attack, and the subsequent anxiety and preoccupation with these attacks tends to avoid situations where a panic attack is likely
 kuch durlabh maamalon main jahaan janaatank se grasit vyakti ke bhayakrant vikaar kaa nidaan maapdand se mail nahin khaataa, tab bhayakrant vikaar ke itihaas ke bina janaatank kaa aupchaarik nidaan kiya jaataa he 
 Agoraphobia patients may face a sudden panic attack when they travel to places where they fear they are out of control, or cannot get help, or may be embarrassed
 ek hamale ke dauraan, epinephrine badi maatra main sravit hota he or sharir kii ladane yaa bhaagane kii prakritik pratikriya ko sakriy kar detaa he

 janaatank or bhayakrant hamale ke adhikansh rogiyon ko expozar upachaar dwaara sthaayee raahat pradaan kii ja sakati he
 The elimination of residual and subclinical agoraphobic isolation, rather than just panic attacks, should be the goal of exposure therapy
 Similarly, systematic desensitization can also be used

 This treatment involves coaching the participant through a dynotic discussion, aiming to replace unfounded and obstructed beliefs by more factual and beneficial beliefs
 janaatank se grasiton main shithilikaran takanic aksar upyogi hote hai, kyonki inkaa istemaal chintaa or hamale ke lakshanon ko rokane yaa samaapt karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 The most commonly used anti-depressant medications for the treatment of anxiety disorders are mainly in the SSRI class and include sertaline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine
 benjodigepine prashantak, MAO inhibitors or triciclic antedepressents ko bhi saamanytah janaatank ke ilaaj ke liye nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he

 Many people with anxiety disorder are enamored by joining a self-help or support group
 Sharing self-help tools along with exchanging problems and achievements with each other are common activities of these groups
 vishesh rup se tanaav prabandhan takanic or vibhinn prakaar ke dhyaan abhyaas ke alawa maansik- darshan takanic, chintaa vikaron se grasit rogiyon ko shant karne main madad kar sakati he or chikitsa ke prabhaav ko badha sakati he

 shavrove se data Common symptoms pradarshan Ambush marketing or ambush marketing can be defined as a marketing strategy in which advertisers associate themselves with a particular program without paying a sponsorship fee and thus benefit from it
 macmillan angreji shabdkosh, ghaat vipanan ko ek aisi vipanan ranneeti ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisamen ek pratispardhi brands koi praayojan shulk die bina hi apane aap ko kisi badi khel ghatana ke saath jod letaa he
 According to mccarthy, ambush marketing is a type of marketing by a company that is not the official sponsor of an event, but which advertises using the event to attract the customer's attention to the advertisement
 ek saidhantik pariprekshya se, ghaat vipanan main company apane aap ko kisi vishesh aayojan ke saath jod kar isaki lokapriyata, saakh or pratishtha ko bhunaane kaa prayaas karti he, jabaki iske liye aavashyak party se sahamati nahin lee jaati
 The term "ambush", used in ambush marketing, means "ambush" and is derived from an old French verb ambushier, meaning "to put in a forest"
 The term "ambush marketing" was coined by eminent marketing strategist Jerry Welsh when he was acting as a manager of world-class marketing efforts for the American Express Company in the 1980s

 When a company engages in ambush marketing, the sponsorship for the sponsor ends
 isliye, praayojan kaa mahatva bhi ghat jaataa he
 Because it is an indisputable fact that corporate sponsorship is one of the biggest money-making sources of revenue for the organizers of the event, a loss in the value of the sponsorship will affect the financial strength of the organizer

 sanganak sanchika ekatrit jaankaree kaa ek varg he, yaa jaankaree ko sanchit karne ke liye ek sansaadhan he jo ki kisi sanganak kaarykram ko uplabdh hota he or aamtaur par yah kisi prakaar kii tikaoo sanganak bhandaaran par aadhaarit hota he
 The file is durable in that it exists for use by other programs even after the current program has finished
 sanganak sanchikaon ko paaramparik rup se daphtaron or pustakaalayon ke filon main maujuud kagaz ke dastavezon kaa aadhunik rup mana ja saktaa he, isiilie angrezi main iskaa naam fil padaa he
 At the lowest level, many modern operating systems consider files to be only a series of one-dimensional bytes
 adhik ucch str par, jab sanchika kii saamagree ko bhi maddenzar rakhaa ja rahaa ho, to ye dwilvie ank purna, akshar, chhavi pixel, dhwani yaa kisi or chiz kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue maane ja sakate hai
 It is up to the program to use the file how it interprets the file and understand the internal settings of the information so that it can present the same information in a more meaningful style to the user
 kisi bhi samay par sanchika kaa ek aakaar hoga, aamtaur par yah biton main abhivyakt kiya jaataa he or yah darshata he ki is sanchika ne bhandar main kitni jagah gheri hui he
 In most modern operating systems this size can be any nonnegative integer, but will have a maximum limit according to the system
 lekin sanchika kii saadhaaran paribhaasha yah lazimi nahin tehraati he ki uske maujuuda aakaar kaa koi vaastavik arth ho, sivaay us maamle main jab sanchika kii saamagree, ek drudh sangrah ke samooh ke andar kii kuch saamagree ho
 For example, in a Unix-like system, the file to which the link to / bin / ls points is defined and rarely changed
 isaki tulana / dev / null se karen to yah bhi ek sanchika he par iskaa aakaar hameshaa badalata rahata he balki shaayad us tarah myne hi nahin rakhata he jaise pichley udhaaharan kaa myne rakhata he
 The information and small information contained in a computer file can be in the form of bundles or can also be movable
 yah maatr sanchika ke rachanaakaar par nirbhar he ki usamen jaankaree kaa aayojan kis prakaar kiya jayega
 For this reason, many low-standard file structures exist that can serve any purpose, from the simplest to the most complex
 adhiktar sanganak sanchikaon kaa istemaal sanganak kaarykram karte hai
 These programs create, change and delete the appropriate files for their use
 jo kaarykram-nirmaataa in kaaryakramon ko banaate hai, vahi faisalaa karte hai ki koun si filon kii zarurat he, unka istemaal kaise hona he or unke naam bhi ve nirdhaarit karte hai
 In some cases, computers manipulate program files in such a way that they are visible to the computer user
 udhaaharan ke liye shabd-sansaadhan carkram main prayokta dastauez sanchikaon main badlaav karte hai or prayokta khud hi unhen naam bhi dete hai
 The contents of the document file are organized in such a way that the word-processing program understands it, but the user determines its name and storage address, and the key information of storage is also determined by the user
 kai anuprayog sabhi saamagree sanchikaon ko ek hi sanchika main ghused dete hai or alag alag prakaar kii jaankaree kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye andar hi nishaan laga ke rakhte hai
 Content files from games like Doom and Quake are an example of this
 sanganak par, sanchikaon ko bananaa, badalanaa, badhanaa, chota karnaa, sthanantarit karnaa or mitaanaa sambhav he
 In most cases, all this is done by running computer programs on the computer, but the user of the computer can also make changes to files if needed
 udhaaharan ke liye, microsoft verde kii sanchikaaye aamtaur par prayokta ke nirdeshon ke aadhaar par microsaft verde kaarykram dwaara banaai jaati hai, lekin prayokta in sanchikaon ko sidhe hi windos explorer jaise kisi sanchika prabandhak kaarykram ke jariye bhi hataa, mitaa yaa sthanantirit kar saktaa he
 In unix-like systems, user-zone processes usually do not directly connect to files; The operating system provides a segregation level that allows almost all transactions with files from the user-area to occur through hard links
 kathor kadiyon ke jariye kisi sanchika kaa naam diya ja saktaa he ; vishuddh rup se prachaalan pranali main sanchikaon ke naam nahin hote hai
 For example, user-area programs cannot delete a file, they can only delete a link to that file, and if the linker finds that the file no longer has any other links, it can delete this file
 Can be erased
 vastav main keval ashthi hi sanchikaon se len-dein karata he, par prayokta-kshetra ke anurodhon kaa sanchikaon ke jariye is tarah hota he ki prayokta-kshetra kaaryakramon ko yah agyaat hi rahata he
 While the transaction of programs with files varies according to the operating system and file system, mainly these activities are common: aadhunik sanganak pranaaliyon main sanchikaon tak pahunchne ke liye aamtaur par filanaamon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In some operating systems, this name is associated with the file
 kuch anya main sanchika swayan benaam hoti he, par namit kadiyaan uski ore ingit karti hai
 In this case, the user can only recognize the link as the file name, but this will not be true, especially when the same file has more than one link
 sanchikaaye nirdeshikaon main ho sakati hai
 But it would be better to say that the directory can contain a list of files or a list of links to files
 is paribhaasha ke antargat yah samajhnaa bahut zaruri he ki "sanchika" shabd main nirdeshikas bhi shaamil hai
 This makes staging of directories possible, ie subdirectories inside directories
 jo naam kisi nirdeshika ke andar kisi sanchika ko sanderbhit karata he, use anokhaa hona zaruri he
 But some operating systems also specify a type with a name, which makes it possible to have two different types of files in a directory with the same name, such as a directory and a file of the same name
 jin paryaavarnon main sanchikaaye namit hoti hai, unamem, sanchika ke naam va path kii jodi anokhi honi zaruri he - koi bhi do sanchikaon kaa naam va path dono kisi or sanchika ke naam va path se mail nahin kha sakate hai
 Where the file is anonymous, named references will reside under a namespace
 adhiktar baar kisi bhi namasthaan main maujuud naam thik ek yaa shunya sanchikaon ko sanderbhit karegaa
 However, any file can be referenced in a namespace with zero, one or more names
 anuprayog ke prasang ke anusaar, kisi bhi sanchika yaa kadi ke liye upyukt naam kinhin khaas aksharon se bani hogi
 The computer system depends on whether the name is appropriate or not
 praarambhik sanganak kisi sanchika ke naam main simit akshar va ankon kii anumati dete the, lekin aadhunik sanganak lambey naam rakhane dete hai jinamein lagbhag kisi bhi kram main unicode akshar yaa unicode ank ho sakate hai, taaki ek hi nazar main sanchika kaa makasad samaj aa jaae
 Some computer systems allow empty spaces in file names, some do not
 sanchika naamon kii laghuderghakshar samvedansheeltaa sanchika pranali dwaara nirdhaarit hoti he
 Unix file systems are typically short-term and allow user-level applications to create files that contain only short and long letters
 microsoft windos kai sanchika pranaliyaan pradaan karata he, jinamein lugh-deergh samvedansheeltaa kii nitiyaan alag alag hai
 If the user uses a disk editor to change file names in directory entries, then the prevalent FAT system may contain many files whose names differ only by capitalization
 lekin, aamtaur par prayokta anuprayog isaki anumati nahin dete hai
 Most computers organize files based on steps and use folders, directories or catalogs for this
 shabd jo bhi ho vichaar ek hi he
 Each folder may contain some number of files and may contain other folders
 in anya folderon ko upfolder kehete hai
 These may contain more files and folders, etc
, etc
, by creating a tree-like structure containing a "master folder" or under which any number of files and folders can be
 folderon ke bhi sanchikaon kii tarah naam ho sakate hai 
 It is easy to organize files logically through folders
 jab bhi koi sanganak folderon kaa istemaal karata he to harek sanchika va folder kaa keval apana naam hi nahin apitu ek path bhi hota he jo yah darshata he ki vah sanchika yaa folder kis folder yaa folderon main maujuud he
 In this path, a special mark - such as / - is written between the file or folder names
 udhaaharan ke liye is lekh main die udhaaharan main, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers yah darshata he ki Managers naamak ek sanchika, Salaries naamak folder main he, r yah folder Payroll main he
 There is a forward line between the file and folder names, the topmost or root folder has no name, so the name starts with a forward line
 kai sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon me vistaaron kaa istemaal karte hai, inhen sanchika prakaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Windows computers, the extension takes the form of a dot after the name of the file and a few characters before the point, these characters identify the type of file
 
txt vistaar paathya sanchika kaa pahchaan he, 
doc vistaar kisi dastauez kaa pahchaan he, khaastaur par microsoft verde sanchika praaroop main; aadi ityadi
 Even when extensions are used on the computer system, there is considerable diversity in the extent to which the computer system recognizes and behaves according to them, in some systems they are indispensable, while in others they are also present
 It does not matter, they are ignored
 kai aadhunik sanganak pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko nuksaan pahunchne se rokane ke tareeke pradaan karti he
 Computers that allow more than one user also enforce file permissions to control which files and folders can be created, deleted, or changed
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi prayokta ko ek sanchika ko badalane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin, yaa phir sanchikaaye va folder banane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin
 It can also be determined through permissions that only a few users can see the contents of a file or folder
 anumatiyon ke jariye sanchikaon main maujuud saamagree ke avaidh badlaav yaa vinaash se bachaav hota he or nijee jaankaree ko gopneey rakhane ke liye avaidh prayoktaaon ko kuch sanchikaaye dekhne se roka ja saktaa he
 Many computers have another rescue method known as "read only mark"
 yah chihn lage hone par sanchiko kaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he par badla nahin ja saktaa he
 This sign is useful for critical information that should not be changed or erased, such as for certain files used by internal components of a computer system
 kuch pranaliyaan ek "chhipi hui chihn" bhi shaamil karti hai, jo yah sunishchit karata he ki sanchika adrishy ho jaae
 With this symbol, the computer system hides important system files that should not be changed by users
 uparokt charchaa main sanchika kaa varnan ek ucch stareey prachaalan pranali yaa prayokta ke liye ek pariklpana ke taur par hua he
 However, any file must be physically present to be truly workable
 arthath, ek sanchika kii amoort avadharana ko vaastavik sanganak pranali main vaastavik bhautik rup main hona aavashyak he, anyathaa uskaa aastitiv hona na hona baraabar he
 Physically, most computer files are stored in some kind of content storage device
 udhaaharan he hard jisk, jiske jariye adhiktar prachaalan pranaliyaan chalati hai
 Most of the files are kept in these
 21veen sadi ke praarabdh main hard discs sarvaadhik uplabdh gaiyr vaashpashil bhandaaran upkaran he
 If the files contain only temporary contents, they can be stored in RAM
 unics jaisi prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchikaon kaa kisi bhautik bhandaaran upkaran se sidhaa vaasta nahin hota he: / dev / null iskaa ek pramukh udhaaharan he, isi tarah / dev, / proc or / sys ke antarangat maujuud lagbhag sabhi sanchikaaye bhi isi prakaar kii hai
 They can be used as files in the user area
 lekin ye abhaasi sanchikaaye hai jo vastav main keval prachaalan pranali kii ashthi kii vastuon ke taur par vidyaman rahati hai
 Computer files can be stored in magnetic strips
 kuch sthitiyon main sanchikaon ko anya madhyamon main bhi bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he jaise ki lekhneey kampact discs, ankiy bahuvid discs, zip drive, yuasabi flash drive aadi
 When computer files contain very important information, the copying process tries to avoid the consequences in situations in which the files may get destroyed
 sanchikaon kii pratilipi karne kaa matlab bas yahi he ki sanchikaon kii pratiyaan kisi anya sthaan par baan ke rakhana taaki yadi mul sanganak ko kuch ho jaataa he yaa ve galati se mit jaati hai to prati ke jariye unhen waapas paaya ja sake
 There are several ways to copy files
 adhiktar sanganak pranaliyaan suvidhaatmak kaarykram pradaan karte hai jo ki prati rakhane kii prakriya main suvidha pradaan karte hai, kyonki yadi bahut si sanchikaon kii pratiyaan rakhni hai to isamen bahut samay lag saktaa he
 Files are often copied to transferable mediums such as writable cds or cartridge tapes
 ek hi sanganak kii duusari hard discs main sanchikaon ko pratilipit karne se ek discs ke kharaab hone se to bachaav ho jaataa he par yadi puure sanganak ke kharaab yaa nasht hone ke jokhim se bachaav karnaa he to un sanchikaon kii pratiyaan aise madhyam main karnaa zaruri he jo is sanganak se dur le ja ke kisi surakshit jagah par bhandaarit kii ja sake
 The grand-father-son copy method automatically creates three copies, the oldest copy of the file being the grandfather file and the son existing copy
 kis sanganak dwaara sanchikaon ko yojit, namit, bhandaarit va parivartit karne kii pranali ko uski sanchika pranali kaha jaataa he
 Most operating systems have at least one file system
 kai prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchika pranaliyaan ek saath chalaai ja sakati he
 For example, newer MS Windows computers support older fat-style file systems of MS-DOS, as well as NTFS, the popular file system of the latest Windows versions
 har pranali ke apane faayde nuksaan hai
 For example, in standard FAT, only 8-letter file names run, whereas NTFS contains possible long file names that may contain spaces
 aap kisi sanchika ko antiatioes main Payroll records jaisaa naam de sakate hai lekin effeti main yah naam kuch payroll
dat jaisaa hi ho saktaa he 
 File manager programs are convenient programs through which files and folders can be moved, created, deleted, or renamed, but they do not actually allow you to read or add content to the file
 har sanganak pranali apni mul sanchika pranali ke liye kam se kam ek sanchika prabandhak pradaan karata he
 The most commonly used file manager program in Windows is Windows Explorer and on Mac it is Finder
 linaks main notilas, conkvarar jaise kai sanchika prabandhak hai
 The use of the English word "file" for file storage in reference to computer storage was started since 1952 for information stored in camouflage leaves
 praarambhik prayog main log antarnihit tantransh ko hi fil kehete the
 For example, IBM 350's disk drives were called "disk files"
 1962 ke sangat samay saajha pranali jaisi pranaaliyon main aisi sanchika pranaliyaan thim jo ek hi sanchay upkaran par kai "sanchikaaye" pradarshit karti thim or is tarah is shabd kaa aadhunik upyog shuru hua
 CTSS file names had two parts, a user-readable "principal name" and the other "secondary name" that indicated the type of file
 yah aachaar kai prachaalan pranaaliyon dwaara aaj bhi kaam main liya jaataa he, inamen microsoft windos bhi shaamil he
 While the "register file" used today shows the initial hypothesis of files, it is often lost
