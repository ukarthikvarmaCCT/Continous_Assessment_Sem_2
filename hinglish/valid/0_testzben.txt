 Haldighati is a historical place in Rajasthan famous in Indian history, where Maharana Pratap fought numerous battles and performed valor to preserve the honor of his motherland
 haldighati rajasthan ke udaipur zile se 27 mile uttar-pashchim evam nathdwara se 7 mile pashchim main sthit he
 It was here that on June 18, 1576, a fierce battle took place between the Mughal army of Emperor Akbar and Maharana Pratap and his Rajput army
 is yuddh main pratap ke saath kai rajput yoddhaon sahit hakim khaan sur bhi upasthit tha
 Rana Pratap was supported by the local Bhils in this war, which was the main point of this war
 mughalon kii ore se raja maansingh sena kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Haldighati is a famous place located in the middle of the hills, some distance away from the road leading from Udaipur to Nathdwara, where in 1576 AD there was a fierce war between the forces of Maharana Pratap and Mughal Emperor Akbar
 is sthaan ko 'goganda' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Among the Rajput kings of Akbar, Maharana Pratap of Mewar was the one who did not like the friendly slavery of the Mughal emperor
 isi baat par unki amer ke maansingh se bhi anban ho gai thi, jiske falswaroop maansingh ke bhadakaane se akbar ne swayan maansingh or saleem kii adhyakshata main mewar par akraman karne ke liye baari sena bheji
 The battle of Haldighati was fought on 18 June 1576 AD
 isamen rana pratap ne apratim veerta dikhaai
 His supreme devotee Sardar Jhala Maan was awarded to Virgati in this battle
 swayan pratap ke durgharsh bhaale se gajasin saleem bal-bal batch gaya
 Sensing the situation, Pratap came out of the battlefield on his injured, but brave horse, where Chetak gave up his life
 is sthaan par is swamibhakt ghode kii samadhi aaj bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 In this war, 14 of the 22 thousand armed forces of Pratap were used
 isamen se 500 vir sainik rana pratap ke sambandhi the
 The Mughal army suffered heavy losses and around 500 chieftains were also killed
 saleem ke saath jo sena aayi thi, uske alaava ek sena vakt par sahaayta ke liye surakshit rakhi gai thi
 And the loss of the main army was equalized by this army
 isi kaaran mughalon ke hataahaton kii thik-thik sankhya itihaaskaaron ne nahin likhi he
 After this war, Rana Pratap had to spend a lot of time with difficulty
 kintu unhone kabhi saahas nahin choda or apane rajya kaa adhikansh mughalon se waapas chin liya tha
 This war was inconclusive
 balidaan bhoomi Haldighati is the sacred sacrificial land of Rajputana, whose history has been tinted with the grand saga of valor and glory
 bheelon kaa apane desh or naresh ke liye vah amar balidaan, rajput veeron kii vah tejaswita or maharana kaa vah lokottar parakram itihaas main prasiddh he
 All these facts are the ultimate product of Veerakavya
 mewar ke ushn rakt ne shravan samvath 1633 vi
 main haldighati kaa kan-kan laal kar diya
 Chetak, the beloved horse of Maharana Pratap, worked so hard to get them safe, that in the end he fell at the feet of his master forever
 yuddh kii taiyaaridilli kaa uttaradhikari shahzada saleem mogul sena ke saath yuddh ke liye chadh aayaa
 He was accompanied by Mohabat Khan, the caste-deficient son of King Mansingh and Sagarji
 pratap ne apane parvaton or baees hazaar rajputon main vishwaas rakhte hue akbar ke putr kaa saamana kiya
 The imperial army did not face any kind of resistance till the west end of Aravalli, but the route ahead was under Pratap's control
 pratap apni nai rajdhani ke pashchim kii ore pahadiyon main aa date
 The length of this area was about 80 miles and was the same width
 sara ilaaka parvaton or wanon se ghira hua tha
 Many small rivers flowed in between
 rajdhani kii taraf jane vaale maarg itane tang or durgam the ki badi kathinaayee se do gaadiyaan aa-ja sakati thim
 The name of this place is Haldighati, crossing the mountain standing at its entrance and entering it was like buying a crisis
 pratap ke saath vishwasi bhil log bhi dhanush or baan lekar dat gaye
 There were huge stones piled near the Bhils, as soon as the enemy would come from the front, it was planned to roll the stones and break their heads
 haldighati kaa yuddh Maharana Udai Singh became Rana in 1541 AD and shortly after becoming Rana, Akbar's Mughal army invaded Mewar and surrounded Chittor
 kintu rana udaisingh ne akbar kii adheenta sweekaar nahin kii or pracheen adhatpur ke paas udaipur naamak apni rajdhani basaakar vahaan chale gayi
 After him Maharana Pratap also continued the war and did not accept subjugation
 'haldighati kaa yuddh' 'bhartiya itihaas' main prasiddh he
 The 'battle of Haldighati' between the Rajputs and the Mughal soldiers was fought in June, 1576 AD
 badshaah akbar ne mewar ko purnroop se jeetne ke liye raja maansingh evam aasaf khaan ke netritv main mogul sena ko akraman ke liye bheja
 There was a war between the two armies between the Haldighati branch of the Aravalli hill near 'gogunda'
 donon ore kii senaaon kaa saamana hote hi bheeshan rup se yuddh shuru ho gaya or donon taraf ke shoorveer yoddha ghayal hokar zamin par girane lage
 Pratap, riding on his horse Chetak, quickly reached within the enemy's army and started searching for Raj Singh's enemy Mansingh
 vah to nahin mila, parantu pratap us jagah par pahunch gayi, jahaan par saleem apane hathi par baitha hua tha
 Many of Salim's bodyguards were killed by Pratap's sword and Akbar would have lost his heir if Pratap's spear and Salim did not have a thick iron sheet between them
 rana pratap ke ghode chetak ne apane swami kii ichha ko bhaanpakar puraa prayaas kiya or tamaam aitihaasik chitron main saleem ke hathi ke soond par chetak kaa ek uthaa hua pair or pratap ke bhaale dwaara mahavat kaa chaati kaa chalni hona ankit kiya gaya he
 Mannaji's sacrifice began to run away from the battlefield, including Salim, the injured elephant, when the Mahavat was killed, but Salim controlled him
 yuddh us samay or bhi bhayanak ho uthaa, jab shahzada saleem par rana pratap ke akraman ko dekhakar asankhya mogul sainik usee taraf bade or pratap ko gherkar chaaron taraf se un par prahaar karne lage
 Rana Pratap had a crown of Mewar on his head, by which all Mughals were able to recognize Pratap
 isliye mogul sainik usee ko nish banaakar waar kar rahe the
 The Rajput soldiers also struggled to save Rana by placing his life on his palm
 parantu dhire-dhire pratap sankat main faste ja rahe the
 After examining the seriousness of the situation, Jhala Sardar 'mannaji' sacrificed his life, presenting an incomparable ideal of loyalty
 jhaalaa sardaar mannaji tezi ke aage badha or pratap ke sir se mukut utaar kar apane sir par rakh liya or tezi ke saath kuch duuri par jaakar ghamaasan yuddh karne laga
 The Mughal soldier considered him to be Pratap and broke down on him and Pratap got an opportunity to get away from the battlefield
 unka sara sharir aganit ghaavon se lahooluhaan ho chukaa tha
 While going from the battlefield, Pratap saw Mannaji dying
 rajputon ne bahaduree ke saath mughalon kaa muqaabala kiya| yubhumi par upasthit baees hazaar rajput sainikon main se keval aath hazaar jivit sainik yubhumi se kisi prakaar bachakar nikal paye or mughalon ko bhi baari kshati hui or unhen peeche hatana padaa| End of war 'haldighati kaa yuddh' yuddh anirnaayak rahaa
 The open war was over, but the conflict was not over
 bhavishya main sangharsho ko anjaam dene ke liye rana pratap evam unki sena yuddh sthal se hatakar pahari pradesh main aa gayi thi
 In the following years, when Akbar's attention was shifted to other works, Pratap had regained his places
 san 1597 main chownd main unki mrityu ho gai thi
 Because of Akbar's subjection, the stories of Pratap's courage and valor will be echoed as long as the wars are narrated
 yuddh ke dauraan pratap kaa swamibhakt ghoda chetak ghayal ho gaya tha, phir bhi vah buree tarah ghayal ho chuke apane swami ko yuddh sthal se dur nikaal le jane main safal rahaa
 He protected his master from falling into the hands of enemies and Mevirgati was finally achieved
 yuddh sthali ke sameep hi chetak kii smriti main smarak bana hua he
 Now there is a museum here
 is sangrahalay main haldighati ke yuddh ke maidan kaa ek model rakhaa gaya he
 Apart from this, items related to Maharana Pratap have also been kept here
 maharana pratap kaa chota bhai shakti singh mogul sena main tha pratap ko ghayal hua dekhakar do mogul senic pratap kaa peechha karne lage to shakti singh kaa bhai prem jaag gaya ore mogul senico ko maar diya or apane bhai kii raksha kii or us jagah par chetak ne praan tyaag die jahaan aaj bhi chetak kaa smarak bana hua he| In the end, this war may have been inconclusive, but one thing is known from this war that Akbar was afraid of Pratap, he sent a Rajput and his son from Maharana Pratap to battle, there were many Rajputs in his army
 But he himself did not come before Maharana throughout his life

 Tribal literature refers to the literature in which the life and society of the tribals is expressed in accordance with their philosophy
 adivasee sahitya ko vibhinn naamon se puri duniya main janaa jaataa he
 In Europe and America, it is called Native American Literature, Colored Literature, Slave Literature and african-american Literature, Black Literature in African Countries and Aboriginal Literature in Australia, then Indigenous Literature in English, First People Literature and Tribal Literature
 bharat main ise hindi evam anya bhartiya bhashaaon main saamanytah ‘adivasee sahitya’ hi kaha jaataa he
 The study tradition of non-tribal literature divides tribal literature into two categories - lekin adivasee sahityakar is vibhaajan ko sweekaar nahin karte
 They believe that since their biography is not in favor of any division, there is symmetry and equality in their society, so their literature is also not divided
 vah ek hi he
 They call their literature 'orature'
 orechar arthath oral + litarechar
 He has established that his written literature today is also the literature of the tradition of his oratorical literature
 orechar kii avadharana sabase pehle uganda ke adivasee lekhak piyo jiremu ne prastut kii thi jise duniya ke adhikansh adivasee lekhakon or sahityakaron ne sweekaar kiya
 Among them are Ngugi wa Thyongo of Africa and Vandana Tete of India

 There are three types of opinions about the concept of tribal literature
 pehali avadharana gaiyr-adivasee lekhakon kii he
 But there are some tribal writers in support
 jaise, ramanika gupta, sanjeev, rakesh kumaar singh, mahua maji, bajrang tiwari, ganesh devi aadi gaiyr-adivasee lekhak, or hariraam meena, mahadev toppo, ivi hansda aadi adivasee lekhak
 The second concept is that of tribal writers and litterateurs who consider the literature written by tribals based on birth and self-realization as tribal literature
 antim or teesri avadharana un adivasee lekhakon kii he, jo ‘adivasiyat’ ke tatwon kaa nirvaah karne vaale sahitya ko hi adivasee sahitya ke rup main sweekaar karte hai
 The Indian tribal group of such writers and writers presented this concept in concrete form in a two-day national seminar held in Ranchi on 14-15 June 2014, which is being known as the 'ranchi Declaration of Tribal Literature' and Now tribal literature has become the central point of discussion
 adivasee sahitya kii buniyadi shart usamen adivasee darshan kaa hona he jiske mul tatv hai - Tribal literature is orally very rich and abundant in its native tribal languages

 Considerable criticism has been leveled against this practice, both by Hindu organizations as opposed to state funding of private pilgrimage outside India and by Muslim pressure groups
 As an example of the latter, Mohib Ahmad contends that even Air India's subsidized fare is higher than competing airlines' ordinary fare
 However, the government has continued offering the Haj subsidy despite protests from the Muslim community at large
 Syed Shahabuddin claims that Air India's rising costs for travel, and the consequent increases in the Government of India's subsidy, have resulted from differences in foreign exchange rates beyond the airline's control
 He suggests charter fares should be set at two-thirds of regular IATA fares, but points out that the Haj has higher costs than other charters because two empty flights are required to return the aircraft to India and to position the aircraft in Arabia for the pilgrims' return journey
 Shahabuddin maintains that the subsidy ought to be phased out because Hindus view the subsidy as preferential treatment of India's Muslim minority
 Other Muslim leaders have argued that the Hajj subsidy is "un-islamic" and that Hajj money should be invested in education and health instead
 moulana mahmud madani, a member of the rajya sabha and general secretary of the jamiat-e-ulema-e-hind, declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic sharia, since the quran declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources
 Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is unislamic
 Likewise, Hindu groups argue that a government sponsored Hajj subsidy forcibly taxes Hindus to pay for Muslim religious pilgrimages, and tantamounts to appeasement of Islam
 After considerable pressure from Muslim groups and the Ministry of Minority Affairs, the Congress government in 2010 decided to begin phasing out the Haj subsidy that had been in operation since 1993
 The Central Haj Committee of India will work through the Ministry of External Affairs to restructure the air fares so that the richer Hajis will pay a premium for the poorer pilgirms
 The entire restructuring is expected to take about seven years and be completed by 2017
 In August 2010, the Minority Affairs Ministry formally opposed providing subsidy for Haj pilgrimage, saying the scheme — in operation since 1993— was contrary to the teachings of Islam
 The Government of India has proposed that starting from 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person will be decreased, and by 2017 will be ended completely

 High and low are collectively called extreme
 ye ucchisht or nimnisht falan ke kisi simit kshetra main ho sakate hai athwa us falan ke sampoorn domen main
 The high and low located in a limited area of the function are called 'local vertices' whereas the highest / lowest values of the function in the entire domain of the function are called 'global vertices'
 parshv chitra main lobal or local charam maan dikhaaye gayi hai
 More broadly, the highest and lowest members of a set are the highest and lowest values among the members of that set
 falnon ke charam maanon ko nikaalnaa hi ishtatmakaran kaa uddeshy he
 We consider the following function sabase pehle ham is falan kaa pratham avkalaj nikaalte hai or usko shunya ke baraabar rakhkar sambhavit ucchisht / nimnisht kaa pataa lagaate hai
 To make sure that x = 0 is superimposed on / low, we assume the second derivative of this function at x = 0 and see if the second derivative is positive or negative at both points
 nimnlikhit falan ko lete hai- Let's find the first derivative of: falan kaa dwitiya avkalaj yah he: Keeping the first derivative zero, the value of x gives the following: x 1 = 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_{1}={ \ sqrt { \ frac {1}{2 xxrep 4 } par falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan rinatmak he, atah x=x_1 par is falan kaa ucchisht he
 Similarly we see that the value of the second derivative of the function at x 2 = - 1 2 { \ displaystyle x_ {2} = - { \ sqrt { \ frac {1} {2 xxrep 4 } is positive, so the function at x_2 The following is nimnlikhit falan par vichaar karen jiskaa graph saamne diya gaya he- First of all, we find the first derivative of this function and keep it equal to zero and find the possible high / low
 is baat ko sunishchit karne ke liye ki x = 0 par ucchisht / nimnisht he, ham is x=0 par is falan ke dwitiya avkalaj kaa maan nikaalte hai or dekhte hai ki yah dhanatmak he yaa rinatmak
 Therefore, we conclude that this function has neither high nor low
