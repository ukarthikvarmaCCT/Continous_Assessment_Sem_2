 katappa apni kahani sunanaa jari rakhata he ki kis prakaar usne bahubali ko maaraa


 After winning from Kalakeya, Amarinder Bahubali is declared the future king and Bhallal Dev as commander in Mahishmati
 rajbhishek hone se purv hi amarendra kii maan shivgami uske liye dulhan kii talash karne lagati he
 She tells Amarendra and Katappa to visit it to understand the state of the empire and its people
 amarendra ko kuntal samrajya kii rajkumaari or uske raja kii bahan, devsena se pyaar ho jaataa he
 Bhallal comes to know that Amarendra has fallen in love with Devasena
 iske baad vah shivgami se kahata he ki vah devsena se shaadi karnaa chahta he
 Shivgami is not aware that Amarendra loves Devasena, so she promises to marry him to Devasena
 jab shivgami shaadi kaa prastaav kuntal rajya ko bhejti he to doot us prastaav ko is prakaar likhata he jaise kisi ghamandi vyakti ne likhaa he
 Devasena refuses this marriage proposal with strong words
 jab shivgami ko uskaa uttar miltaa he to vah krodh main devsena ko bandi bana kar laane kaa aadesh de detii he
 The Kuntal Empire gets attacked by the Pigeonies
 devsena ke bhai kumaar verma kii sahaayta se amarendra us hamale ko vifal kar detaa he or kuntal ko bachaa letaa he
 Amarendra tells him who he is and tries to overcome the fear of Shivagami's anger and persuade him to become his bride
 jab wo mahismati pahunchataa he, tab use galatfahami kaa pataa chalata he
 Sivagami speaks of him choosing the throne or one of the Devasena
 vah devsena ko chunata he
 Due to this, Bhallal is made the king of the place and yet Amarendra is considered the king over the commander
 devsena kii god bharaai ke liye amarendra ko bhallaal ne senapati ke kaary se chuttee de di thi, jisase vah apni patni ke saath rah sake
 At the same time Devasena speaks against the manipulation of King Bhallal and also questions Sivagami's silence
 is kaaran jhagada shuru ho jaataa he or un donon ko mahal se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 They both started living happily among the people outside, but Bhallal again provokes Shivagami that Amarendra wants to kill him and also says that if he takes direct action civil war can start

 The concept of global justice that can be applied internationally derives from John Rawls's work The Law of Peoples, published in 1999
 unhone apni prasiddh rachana 'a thiyari of justise' main ek behatar udaarataavaadi samaaj ke sanchaalan ke sandarbh main bhedamulak siddhant ke zariye rekhaankit kiya tha ki aarthik or saamaajik asamantaaon ko kuch is tarah samyojit kiya janaa chahie ki hinatam sthiti vaale vyakti ko sabase zyaada faaydaa ho
 Here Rawls intends to implement this justice-related strategy within the nation's borders
 par charles bij or phir thomas poge kaa aagrah tha ki rolls dwaara prastut in siddhanton ko antarrashtriya paimaane lagu kiya janaa chahie
 He argued that the reasons for which Rawls wanted to implement them within a nation-state also exist globally
 in logon ko us vakt niraashaa hui jab rolls ne spasht kiya ki unke dwaara diya gaya siddhant vaishvik nyaay se sambandhit nahin he
 To express his concept of justice at the international level, Rawls created The Law of Peoples to clarify the laws that he believes would be agreed upon by 'orderly people'
 rolls ne suvyavasthit logon kii shrenee main udaarataavaadi logon or ‘shaleen gair- udaarataavaadi logon’ ko shaamil kiya he
 Rawls adopts a realistic utopia in 'the Law of People'
 rolls ke anusaar yah yathartwaadee isliye he ki isamen kai vaastavik sthitiyon par dhyaan diya gaya he
 For example, in the real world, diversity is very high and not all people in the world adopt liberal values nor can they be expected to adopt these values
 apane siddhant kaa nirmaan kai staron par karte hue sabase pehle keval un logon par dhyaan diya he jo udaarataavaadi hai
 For that, he has used two basic conditions, the first relating to the social agreement for the liberal concept of constitutional democratic governance
 duusari mul sthiti udaarataavaadi logon ke pratinidhiyon ke liye he
 In the first basic situation, people decide on what will be the fair conditions to control the basic structure of society
 udaarataavaadi samaaj ke sanchaalak siddhanton ko sunishchit karne ke baad rolls antarrashtriya str kii taraf mudate hue tay karte hai ki udaarataavaadi log kis tarah kii videsh niti kaa chunaav karenge
 According to Rawls, at this stage, a distinctive 'veil of ignorance' is placed on the eyes of the representatives of liberal people
 masalan unhen yah jaankaree nahin he ki ve kis bhugolic kshetra se hai or uski shaktiyaan kya hai, aadi
 Rawls makes it clear that liberal people choose eight principles and three institutions
 is mul sthiti main grahan kiye gayi aath siddhanton main logon ke samaan hone, unki swatantraaa kaa sammaan karne, unke dwaara samjhauton or kiye gayi vaayadon kaa paalan karne, a-hastkshep kii niti par chalane or aatmaraksha par dhyaan dene kii baat kii gayi he
 It has also been clarified that according to these principles, people cannot resort to war for any reason other than self-defense
 iske alaava in aath siddhanton main is baat par jor diya gaya he ki log maanavadhikaron kaa samarthan karenge, yuddh ke samay bhi kuch aacharan sambandhi paabandiyon kaa paalan karenge or unka karttavya hoga ki ve aise logon kii madad karen jo pratikul sthitiyon ke kaaran nyaaypurna yaa maryaadit yaa shaleen raajnneetik or saamaajik vyavastha hasil nahin kar paa rahe hai
 According to Rawls, one of the three institutions chosen by the liberal people will ensure fair trade among the people, the other will enable the people to borrow from the cooperative banking institution and the third will play the same role as that played by the United Nations
 rolls ke mutabik yah sthiti confedereshans of pipul kii he
 After the liberals, Rawls's attention goes to those who like how decent or moderately high-ranking people will choose such principles and organizations
 rolls ke anusaar is tarah ke shaleen logon kii shrenee main aane ke liye chaar kasautiyon par karaa utarana aavashyak he
 These are the four criteria
 pehali, samaaj ko aakraamak nahin hona chahie
 He should do his work in a way that is peaceful and respectful to other societies
 duusari, isaki kanoonee vyavastha or nyaay ke vichaar ko samaaj ke sabhi sadasyon ke buniyadi adhikaron kii suraksha kerani chahie
 It should at least recognize everyone's right to life i
e
 right to livelihood and security, right to freedom ie freedom from slavery, right to personal property and right to formal equality
 rolls maanate hai ki udaarataavaadiyon or gair-udaarataavaadiyon kii taraf se is tarah ke adhikaron ke adhikaron ko manyata milanaa chahie
 Third, the genteel should adopt a system in which those who administer the legal system believe that the law includes the common good
 chauthi, shaleen logon ke paas vichaar-vimarsh kii ek maryaadit padsopaneey prakriya honi chahie jisamen samaaj ke sabhi sadasyon ke ahm hiton ko sthaan mil sake
 Rawls envisions a fictional place, Kaizistan, as an example of decent footsteps
 unke anusaar kaizanistan ko suvyavasthit logon ke ek samaaj ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 He urges that liberal societies in their foreign policy develop the ability to tolerate states such as Kazakhstan
 rolls ke mutabik yathartwaadee rup se zyaada-se-zyaada kaizanistan jaisi kisi vyavastha kii hi ummid kii ja sakati he
 They also emphasize that while encouraging liberal non-liberals by liberals, they should not insist that every society should be liberal
 aise aagrah se in shaleen logon kii jeevantta khatm ho sakati he
 Rawls believes that it is most important to maintain mutual respect between people, whether liberal or non-liberal
 garib deshon ko madad karne ke sandarbh main bhi sarvadeshikta ke samarthakon or rolls ke vichaaron main antar he
 Rawls believes that some societies lack the political and cultural traditions, human capital, knowledge, material and technical resources necessary to become orderly
 suvyavasthit logon kaa karttavya he ki ve aise samaajon ko suvyavasthit logon jaisaa banane main madad karen
 That is, his main job here is to establish just institutions
 ateet ke boj se dabe yaa pichde samaajon kii madad karne kaa yahi lakshya he
 According to Rawls, once this goal is achieved, no further help is needed, even if this society is comparatively poor
 rolls ke anusaar kinhin khaas samaajon kii sampannataa main us samaaj kii raajnneetik samskruti kii mahatvapurn bhoomika hoti he
 Property arises not from accumulated resources but from the political culture of a particular society
 isamen us samaaj kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sansthaaon kii buniyadi sanrachana ko pusht karne vaali dharmik, darshanik or naitik paramparaayen bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 Apart from this, the tendency of study and cooperation also plays a big role
 darasal ye sabhi pahalu mil kar kisi samaaj kii sampannataa badhaate hai
 Rawls opposes the application of the principle of justice introduced in a Theory of Justice internationally on the basis of these reasons
 rolls kii spasht manyata he ki ek baar logon ko aatm-nirdhaaran main or ‘taarkik rup se’ apane maamalon ke bare main samarth bana dene ke baad madad karne kaa kartavya khatm ho jaataa he
 Many critics are of the opinion that the idea of rawls 'people' is not sufficiently clear
 rolls kaa yah maananaa galat he ki rajya ek-duusare se itane swatantra hote hai ki unhen apane naagarik kii sthiti ke liye puri tarah zimmedaar tehraaya ja saktaa he
 In fact, the presence of a discrimination-based international political economy is also responsible for the poverty and certain prosperity of particular states
 thomas poge ne spasht kiya he ki do antarrashtriya adhikaar khaastaur par bhoomika nibhaate hai : pehla antarrashtriya udhaar visheshadhikaar or antarrashtriya sansaadhan visheshadhikaar
 The international community is not worried about how a government is exercising its powers in its state
 use is baat se bhi bahut zyaada fark nahin padataa he ki yah samooh satta main kaise aayaa yaa yah apni satta kaa istemaal kaise kar rahaa he
 Repressive governments can borrow on behalf of their country — it is their international resource privilege, or they can sell their country's natural resources — it is their international resource privilege
 poge ke anusaar chunki isse antarrashtriya str par amir deshon ko faaydaa hota he, isliye ve bhi is sthiti ko sweekaar kar lete hai
 Therefore, we should also pay attention to economic aspects
 poge is baat par jor dete hai ki sampann viksit samaajon main rahane vaale logon kii yah zimmedaari banati he ki ve anyaaypurna vaishvik vyavastha ko khatm karen or garib logon ko isse hone vaale nuksaanon se bachaayen
 Poge suggests that a global resource tax of about one percent should be levied for the benefit of the poorest of developing societies
 viksit samaaj ke logon kaa yah daayitv he ki garib samaaj ke logon kii madad karen
 Rawls has not outlined any clear obligation to help the world's poor financially, while Thomas Poge goes beyond Rawls to emphasize that the rich have an obligation to help the poor
 lekin poge ne jis rup main vaishvik nyaay kii kalpana kii uski mukhya seemaa yah he ki yah sirf sampann deshon ke logon kii naitik agency kaa hi aahvaan karti he
 But the poor have not paid any attention to the agency
 arthath is siddhant main is baat kii puri tarah se upeksha kii jaati he ki garib log vaishvik anyaay yaa nyaay ko kis rup main dekhte hai
 Overall, the theorization between Rolls, Bijs or Poge seems to be a discussion between people of rich countries

 Families commonly refer to a group of husbands, wives, and children, but in most parts of the world it is a group of inhabited blood relatives, including individuals accepted by marriage and adoption

 The task of sacrificing children and initiating them in the conduct of society is mainly in the family
 iske dwaara samaaj kii saanskrithik viraasat ek se duusari peedi ko hastantarit hoti he
 Much of the social dignity of an individual is determined by the family itself
 nar-nari ke yon sambandh mukhyat: parivaar ke daayre main nibaddh hote hai
 If left to the populous societies and cities arising out of industrial civilization, the introduction of a person is mainly on the basis of his family and clan

 Human scientists could not find any society where marriage relations are within the family, hence additional membership is provided to the wife in the patriarchal family and the husband in the maternal family
 yugal parivaar main pati or patni milakar apni pruthak gruhasthi sthapit karte hai
 But in most societies this family is considered to be part of the larger family group, and in many cases of life, the family is controlled by the greater family, apart from close association
 america jaise udyogpradhan deshon main kutumbiyon ke sammilit parivaar ke sthaan par yugal parivaar kii bahulata ho gai he
 Although the society there is patriarchal, the couple's family is not considered part of any larger family there

 In addition to these families, married children and their children, married brothers or sisters and their children may live together
 sammilit parivaar main rakt sambandhiyon kii paridhi bhinn bhinn samaajon main bhinn bhinn he
