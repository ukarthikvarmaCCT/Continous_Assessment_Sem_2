 The act introduced a neo system of government known as the provincial "dyarchy", that is, the government of some regions was placed in the hands of ministers responsible for the provincial legislature while others were appointed by the British-appointed provincial governor
 Were held in the hands of the officials responsible for
 jabaki adhinium, bharatiyon dwaara sarkaar main ek badi bhoomika nibhaane kii maang kaa ek pratibimb tha, saath hi bharat kii vyavastha main us bhoomika kaa kya matlab ho saktaa he iske bare main british bhay kaa ek pratibimb tha
 Experiments with dyarchy proved unsatisfactory
 bhartiya netaaon ke liye ek vishesh rup se niraashaa yah hi ki un kshetron main jahaan keval nammaatr kaa niyantran unhone praapt kiya tha, lekin "mukhya adhikaar" british naukarshahi ke haathon main hi tha
 It was intended to review India's constitutional arrangements and those princely states that were ready to accept it
 haalanki, samjhaute ko rokane ke liye congress or muslim pratinidhiyon ke bich vibhaajan karnaa mukhya kaarak sabit hua chunki vyavastha main sangh ke kaam karne kii mahatvapurn jaankaree thi
 Against the system, the new Conservative-dominated national government in London decided to come forward with the drafting of its own proposal
 lord linlithgo kii adhyakshata main ek sanyukt sansadeey chayan samiti ne kaaphi had tak white paper kii samiksha kii
 On the basis of this white paper, the Government of India bill was created
 cameti str or baad main kattarta ko shant kiya gaya, "suraksha" ko majboot kiya gaya or kendriya vidhansabha ke liye apratyaksh chunaav kaa punah aayojan kiya gaya
 The bill was duly passed into law in August 1935
 is prakriya kaa ek parinaam yah he ki, haalanki bhartiya maangon ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke 1935 kii adhinium ko thodaa or aage janaa chahie tha, iskaa masauda saamagree main bill kaa bistaar or bhartiya bhagidaari kii kami donon kaa arth tha ki bharat main sarvshereshth nirutsaah pratikriya ke saath adhinium kaa hona jabaki britain main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke liye yah kattarpanthi sabit hui
 Although it became unusual for the Acts of the British Parliament to include the Preamble, the lack of one from the Government of India Act 1935 contrasted with the Act of 1919, which led to the purpose of that Act relating to it for Indian political development
 Established a comprehensive philosophy
 20 agast 1917 ko house of comons ke liye bharat mantri edwin montagu ke vaktavy par aadhaarit 1919 ke adhinium kii prastaavna uddhrut he, jo vaada karti he: 


 is a gradual development of self-governing institution with a philosophy for the progressive presentation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire
 canada or australia jaise maujuuda dominian ke saath bhartiya maangon main ab british bharat main sanvaidhanik samta ko praapt karnaa tha jiskaa arth tha ki british rashtramandal main sampoorn swaittata
 An important element in the British political circle doubted that Indians were able to run their country on this basis and with sufficient "security", perhaps, the Dominion status as an objective after a long period of gradual constitutional development saw
 unke bich yah tanaav or bhartiya or british ke bheetar drushti ke parinamswaroop 1935 adhinium ke besanga samjhaute ko paaya gaya jisamen isaki koi apni prastaavna nahin thi, lekin 1919 adhinium kii prastaavna ko isaki jagah rakhaa gaya phir bhi us adhinium ke avshesh ko nirast kiya
 It was generally seen in India as more mixed messages from the British, suggesting a defiant attitude on its part and the barest of "minimum essentials" towards satisfying Indian desires
 sabase aadhunik samvidhanon ke vipareet, lekin us samay ke rashtramandal sanvaidhanik kanoon ke saath saamaanya, adhinium ne "adhikaar ke bill" ko nae pranali ke bheetar shaamil nahin kiya jisaki sthapana kaa uddeshy tha
 However, in the proposed case of the Union of India there were some complications involving a set of rights, as the new entity included nominal sovereign princely states
 haalanki kuch logon dwaara ek alag drushtikon ko mana gaya or nehru report main masauda ruparekha samvidhan main bill ke adhikaar ko shaamil kiya gaya
 In 1947, a relatively few amendments to the Act made the Interim Implementation Constitution of India and Pakistan
 adhinium keval atyant vistrut hi nahin tha, lekin yah 'suraksha maanak' ke saath ghira tha, british jimmedaariyon or hiton ko banaae rakhane ke liye jab bhi isaki aavashyaktaa hoti hastkshep karne ke liye british sarkaar ko sakasham banane ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 To meet this goal, the Indian government's institutions are gradually increasing in the face of Indianisation, the decision to use the Act and the actual administration of the security measures in the hands of the British appointed Viceroy and the Provincial Governors who are the Secretary of State for India Was under control
 'vishaal shaktiyon or jimmedaariyon jise governor general apane vivek yaa apane vyaktigat nirnay ke anusaar anushaasan karnaa chahie, yah spasht he ki uske ko superman kii tarah ho jane kii ummid hoti he
 He must be endowed with an infinite capacity for humility, courage and hard work
 "we have inserted many safeguards in this bill" Sir Robert Horn said 


 "but all those safeguards are about the same person i think and she is Viceroy
 vah puri vyavastha kii lynch-pin he
 


 if the Viceroy fails, nothing can save your installed system
 " yah bhaashan drudh torij ke drushtakon ko pratibimbit karti he jo ek din lebar government dwaara viceroy kii niyukti hone kii sambhaavna dwaara bhaybheet tha
 a proper reading of the Act shows that the British Government has prepared it for itself, whenever they feel they could take full control of it at any time with the legal tools
 haalanki, bina kisi sateek kaaran ke aisa karnaa bharat ke samooh ke saath unki vishwasaneeyata samaapt ho jaati jinka uddeshy adhinium ko praapt karnaa tha
 Some odd ideas: "sangheey sarkaar main 


 jimmedaar sarkaar kii ek jhalak prastut kiya he
 But there is a lack of reality, as the case lacks the necessary powers in defense and foreign affairs, the Governor General is necessarily given a threshold for ministerial activity and the measure of representation of Indian states is negative and even That there is no possibility of the introduction of democratic control
 ek atyant vishisht sarkaar ke nirmaan ke vikaas ko dekhne ke liye yah atyant ruchi kii vishay hogi; nishchit rup se, agar yah safaltaapurvak sanchalit hota he, sabase adhik credit bhartiya netaaon kii raajnneetik kshamta ko jayega, jinhone aupniveshik rajaneta kii tulana main adhik gambhir kathinaaiyon kaa saamana kiya he jinhone swayan-sarkaar kii pranali ko viksit kiya tha jo ki ab dominian str main paraakaashtha par he
 " lord lothian ne ek pantalis minute ke lambi baatcheet main is bill ke bare main apane vichaar rakhe hai: "I agree with the surrendered Kattaro
 Those who are not used to any constitution cannot realize what great powers they have to use
 yadi aap is samvidhan ko dekhenge to aisa lagegaa ki sabhi shaktiyaan governor general or rajyapal main nihit he
 But here the whole power is not vested in the king? Everything is done in the name of the king, but does the king ever interfere in it? Once power falls into the hands of the legislature, the governor or the governor general never intervene
 


 civil seva madad karti he
 You will also feel it
 Once a policy is set, they will take it forward with loyalty and honesty


 ham isaki madad nahin kar sakate hai
 We had to fight with the cutters here
 aapako ye kabhi ehsaas nahin hoga ki shri baldwin or sar samuel hore dwaara kitna mahaan saahas ko dikhaaya gaya he
 We did not want to leave the cutters because we had to communicate in a different language

 The agents of Bill had a huge difference against them at least as at home as they were in India
 "kanoon apane rajasi samanta main, pulon ke neeche sone, galiyon main bheekh maangane or roti churaane ke liye amir ke saath-saath garibon ko bhi varjit karata he
 " adhinium ke tahat, britain nivasee british naagarik or britain main panjikrut british companiyon ko bhartiya nagarikon or bharat main panjikrut companiyon kii tarah hi bartaav karnaa chahie jab tak britain kanoon parsparik vyavhaar se inkaar karte hai
 The impropriety of this arrangement is evident when the status of British capital in an Indian modern region is given greater prominence and total dominance, the impropriety is maintained through the commercial system, the UK in both India's international and coastal shipping traffic Removal of shipping interests and Indian capital in the UK without value and Indians in shipping within the UK Sector is the non-existence
 isamen viceroy kaa hastkshep karne ke liye kaaphi vistrut praavdhaan kii aavashyaktaa he yadi uske apil-ayogy drushtikon main, koi bhartiya kanoon yaa adhinium kii maang, yaa vastav main, britain nivasee british vishyon ke khilaaf bhedbhaav, british panjikrut companiyon or vishesh rup se, british shipping hiton
 "the Joint Committee considered a suggestion under which trade with foreign countries should be done by the Minister of Commerce, but it is decided that all negotiations with foreign countries should be conducted by the Foreign Office or Department of Foreign Affairs as they are in Britain Huh

 yah sach ho saktaa he, lekin swayan saadrishy hi galat he
 In the United Kingdom the two departments are subject to analogy control while in India one is responsible for the federal legislature and the other for the Imperial Parliament
 " From the moment of the Montagu statement of 1917, it was important to remain in the stage of the reform process if the British were to organize a strategic initiative
 haalanki, british raajnneetik cirkil main samrajyavaadee bhaavana or yatharthwaad kii kami ne ise asambhav bana diya
 Thus the involuntary conditional concessions of power in the Acts of 1919 and 1935 caused more dissatisfaction and failed to win the rule of influential groups in India which were desperately needed
 1919 main 1935 ke adhinium, yaa simon kamishan yojana kaaphi safal hui thi
 There is evidence that Montagu is supported in a similar way but his cabinet colleagues did not consider it
 1935 tak ek samvidhan bharat ke dominian ko sthapit kiya, british bhartiya praanton jisamen bharat main sweekaarya gaya ho saktaa he haalanki yah british sansad ko paarit nahin karegaa
 'at that time the balance of power in the conservative party was considered, the enactment passed in 1935 was unthinkable compared to passing the bill
 ' The provincial part of the Act which was automatically enacted originally followed the agreement of the Simon Commission

 The British were appointed provincial governors, who were responsible to the British government through the Viceroy and the Secretary of State for India and accepted the recommendations of the ministers, in their view they were negatively affecting their legislative territory, one Were taking special responsibility like preventing any serious crisis for the peace or tranquility of the province and for the legitimate interests of minorities

 1939 main congress prantiy mantralayon ke istife ke baad rajyapal yuddh tak purv-congress vaale praanton main sidhe shashan kiya tha
 It was generally accepted that the provincial part of the Act conferred a great deal of powers upon the provincial leaders as long as the British officers and Indian leaders acted under the rules
 However, intervention by the British governor intensified the paternal threat was done

 The Viceroy was given overriding and certifying powers under the supervision of the Secretary of State for India which in principle was allowed to govern in a voluntary manner
 adhinium ke sangheey hissaa roodhiwaadee party kaa uddeshy puraa karne ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 Over a very long period, conservative leadership expected nominal dominance status for India from the act, the outlook was dominated by orthodox Hindu alliances and right-wing Hindu alliances which kept themselves prone under the direction and protection of Britain 
 madhyam avadhi main, adhinium se ummid thi : This was accomplished by over-representation of kings, giving each potential minority, the right to vote separately to their respective community of voters, and by removing the executive theoretically, but not practically, by the legislature

 ' (4 farvari 1935 ko bhartiya sanvaidhanik sudhaar par sanyukt sansadeey cameti main boolabhai desai kii report
 However, elements in the Liberals and the Congress were also ready to let it go with a dullness: "linlithgo ne sapru se poocha ki kya usne sochaa ki adhinium 1935 kii is yojana main ek santoshjanak vikalp tha
 Sapru said that they should implement the Act fast and the federal plan is embedded in it
 yah koi adarsh nahin tha, lekin is str par yah ekmaatr he
 


 a few days later Sapru came to Birla to meet the Viceroy
 usne sochaa ki congress sangh kii sweekruti kii ore bad rahaa tha
 Birla said that Gandhi was not much concerned about this through reservation for the Center for Defense and Foreign Affairs but was looking at how to choose the representatives of the states
 birla chaahate the ki pratinidhiyon ke loktantric chunaav kii ore kuch vishisht raajaaon ko chunane main vysarai, gandhi kii madad karen

 Linlithgow was quite intelligent, extremely diligent, honest, serious, and determined to make the act a success, though he was also unassuming, impassioned, lawful and felt very difficult to "enforce terms" with people outside his immediate circle

 1937 main, takaraav ke ek bade saude ke baad, prantiy swaittata ko shuru kiya gaya
 From that point until the declaration of war in 1939, Linlithgow tried its best to unite with the kings to initiate the Confederacy
 is main unhone gharelu sarkaar se kaaphi kam sahyog praapt kiya or antat raajaaon ne federation en maase ko khaarij kar diya
 In September 1939, Linlithgow announced in general that India had gone to war with Germany
 haalanki linlithgo kaa vyavhaar sanvaidhanik rup se sahi tha saath hi bhartiya vichaaron ke liye yah kaaphi aakraamak tha
 This led to the slight resignation of the provincial ministries of the Congress which weakened Indian unity
 1939 se, linlithgo ne yuddh ke prayaas ke samarthan par dhyaan kendrit kiya

 Sea water is salty due to salinity present in oceanic waters
 a 1 kilometer sea water contains 41 million tonnes of salts
 If the salt of the entire hydrosphere is spread flat on this basis, then there will be a 150 m thick salt layer on the entire earth

 The distribution of salinity in the open oceans - The maximum amount of salinity in nonlinear areas is found to be 36 per thousand
 High salinity is found in this area due to high temperature, prevailing hot and dry winds, lack of rainfall and low supply of clean water
 Salinity decreases both from the nonlinear regions and towards the equator and poles
 But the amount of salinity is less in polar regions than in equatorial regions
 The reason for this is that the supply of melted water in polar regions is more and evaporation is less
 In equatorial regions, both clean water supply and evaporation are high
 Local variation in salinity distribution is also found in the coastal region of the ocean
 For example, salinity is found to be low due to the supply of clean water on the mouths of rivers like Amaze, Congo, Niger and Sindh

 The distribution of salinity in partially surrounded ocean depends on the spatial conditions
 The distribution of salinity in the Mediterranean Sea is found to be quite different
 In its north-eastern part, salinity is found to be 39 per thousand and in south-east 41 percent
 41 per thousand in the northern part of the Red Sea and 36 per thousand in the southern part
 The amount of salinity in the Persian Gulf is found to be 48 per thousand

 There is no definite trend in the distribution of salinity towards depth
 Nevertheless, some trends of change emerge with the depth of salinity
 In the polar regions the salinity on the surface decreases and increases towards depth
 The salinity remains low on the surface due to the supply of fresh melt water

 joker ek kaalpanik charitra he, jo christopher nolan kii 2008 kii superhiro film da dark nite main mukhya khalanaayak ke rup main pradarshit hua he
 The Joker was played by Australian actor Heath Ledger, based on a character of the same name in DC Comics
 joker ek manorogi jan-hatyara he, jiske paas hasya ke ek samvednasheel bhaavana he, or vah gutham nagar ko aparaadh se mukti dilaane ke bitman, james gordon or harvey dent ke prayaason ko kamjor karne ke apane prayaason ke liye janaa jaataa he
 This character is a symbol of themes such as chaos, chaos and passion; Throughout the film, he expresses a desire to keep the social order in turmoil through crime, and defines himself only by his conflict with Batman
 charitra kii lager kii vyakhya vishesh rup se graphic upanyaas bitman: da kiling jock or arcum esilam: e syrius house on syrius arth se prabhavit hoti he
 In the film the character is wearing her traditional color palette, while she has clown makeup on her face, and traces of the Glasgow smile on her face
 joker ke rup main lager kaa chayan shuru main vivaadaaspad mana gaya tha, or vah is bhoomika ke liye apekshit vikalp nahin the
 The Joker is considered the best laser performer; And he himself has considered it as his most enjoyable character
 ek aakasmik dawa kii atyadhik maatra lene ke kaaran lager kii mrityu ke chah maheene baad july 2008 main jab film ko release kiya gaya tha, to unka yah pradarshan raaton-raat ek sansani ban gaya, or unhen saarvbhaumik prashansa ke saath saath maranoparant kai puraskaar praapt hue, jinamein se ek sarvshereshth sahaayak abhinayta ke liye academy puraskaar bhi tha
 The Joker goes to rob a crowded bank with five masked allies
 bank lutate samay vah paanch main se chaar logon dwaara ek-duusare kii hatya karvaa detaa he, or phir aakhri vyakti ko khud markar saare paise lekar nikal jaataa he
 He later offers to kill Batman for half of the loot by intervening in a video conference of some of the main goons, Sal Maroni, Chechen, and Gambol with his accountant Lau
 gambol is prastaav ko manaa kar detaa he or "joker" kii mrityu par ek inaam rakh detaa he
 However later, the Joker kills Gambol, and becomes the gangster of his gang
 yah jaanane ke baad ki bitman ne lou ko pakad liya he, maroni or chechan joker ke prastaav ko sweekaar karte hai
 The Joker makes a public declaration that "people will continue to be killed until Batman shows his true identity", and proves his threat to be true by killing Gotham's Police Commissioner Gillian B
 Loeb and Judge Janet Surilo
 jab gotham ke jila vakil, harvey dent, bitman ke rup main khud kii pahchaan saarvajanik kar joker ko uske thikaane se baahar nikaalane kaa prayaas karte hai, to joker uskaa apharan karne kii koshish karata he, or giraftaar kiya jaataa he
 Batman interrogates him when Dent suddenly disappears
 joker yah bhi bataata he ki dent kii premika rahel dowas bhi gaayab ho gai he or phir donon ke alag-alag thikaanon kaa pataa bitman ko dekar vah use bataata he ki donon jagahon par ek saath bam fat jayega, or bitman un donon main se kisi ek ko hi bachaa saktaa he
 The Joker manipulates Batman here as well, and informs Batman about Dent, whose face is disfigured in the explosion, while Rachel is killed elsewhere
 joker iske baad lou ko saath lekar police stesan se bhaag nikalataa he
 The Joker kills Lau and Chechen, and also burns all the money and leads the Chechen gang
 iske baad, wain enterprijej ke emende lau accountint colman reez ko tivi par bitman kii asli pahchaan prakat karne se rokane ke liye, vah ghoshnaa karata he ki agar 60 minute ke bheetar reez ko maaraa nahin jaataa he, to vah aspataal ko bam se uda degaa
 This causes panic throughout the city, and in the meantime the Joker sneaks into Gotham General Hospital as a nurse to meet Dent, prompting Dent to take revenge on those responsible for Rachel's death
 
 iske baad vah us aspataal ko bam se uda detaa he, or bandhakon ko ek bas main bharkar apane saath le jaataa he
 He imprisons civilians and criminals separately by placing explosives on two ships, and tells them that either one of them blows up the other ship, or he will destroy both ships and kill them all
 aakhirkaar, donon jahaajon ke log ek-duusare ko udaane kaa vikalp nahin chunate hai
 Batman later captures the Joker, and the Joker then tells him that neither of them can let each other die, as he believes the existence of the two is based on always fighting each other
 is
 joker bitman se yah bhi kahata he ki usne "gotham kii aatma ke liye ladaai" jiti he, kyonki shahar ke nivaasiyon ko jab ek ek baar dent kaa hatyare vaala "doosraa cheharaa" dikhegaa, to uske turant baad ve log aashaa kho denge
 The Joker then laughs hysterically while he is being taken into custody
 aakhirkaar bitman dent ke aparaadhon ko apane sar lekar joker kii yojana ko vifal kar detaa he
 As an early actor, Heath Ledger did not seriously engage himself with the role he was playing
 yah badal gaya, haalanki, 22 saal kii umr main unhone apni kuch filmon ko dekhnaa shuru kar diya
 Realizing that they were movies he didn't really want to see himself, it made him more cautious and respectful of his professional choices
 2005 kii fantasy film da bros grim ne abhinayta ke liye ek mahatvapurn mode chihnit kiya kyonki nirdeshak terry gilium ne lager ko un paatro ko banane ke avasar die jinhen ve pehle nahin die gaye the
 Gilliam helped Ledger put on a clown act for that film, an experience the actor later acknowledged as an influence on his performance as the Joker
 nideshak christopher nolan ne vibhinn bhoomikaaon ke liye varshon main lager se mulaakaat kii thi
 While initially meeting Batman for Batman's part, Ledger explained that he was not interested in working on such a film
 abhinayta ne superhiro ko chitrit karne ke saath apni samasyaon par parilakshith kiya; "main sirf bevakoof or murkh mahasoos karata hum
 i couldn't pull it off and there are others who absolutely can, but i couldn't take myself too seriously
 " haalanki, baad main bitman begin se prabhavit hua, lager ne joker kaa nolan se hissaa maanga
 Impressed by Ledger's determination, Nolan casts him in part
 "hith bas aisa karne ke liye taiyaar tha, vah kuch bada karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 "casting director John Papsida reflected on the casting choice and said the filmmakers knew they needed someone daring to play the part
 ek script hone se pehle hith lager ko daalaa gaya tha
 Heath Ledger described the Joker as a "schizophrenic clown with psychosis, mass murder, zero sympathy"
 taazgi ke avasar ko hilite karte hue, abhinayta ne pichley film avtaron se alag charitra kii ek nai or alag vyakhya kaa lakshya rakhaa
 Both Ledger and Christopher Nolan set about keeping an eye on the Joker's appearance in the film, sharing common reference points for the character to be which reference point
 araajaktaa or araajaktaa ke darshanik vichaaron ke aadhaar par, unhone drishy sandarbh ke liye francis bekan dwaara kala ko dekha or unhone mailkam mcdowell ke stanley kubrik kii film e clockwork orange main elex ke rup main pradarshan ke bare main baat kii, or elex usee naam ke anthony burgess ke upanyaas main hai
 Ledger was cast by Alan Moore's graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke to prepare for the role, as well as Grant Morrison's graphic novel Arkham Asylum: a Serious House on Serious Earth, which the actor actually tried to read and put it down 
 amtivi ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main, lager ne kaha ki unhone joker ko sabase mjedaar ke rup main anubhav karne kaa anubhav mana, "or shaayad kabhi bhi hoga"
 Wearing the character's traditional color palette, the Joker is dressed in a thin tie and green waistcoat topped with a purple overcoat, stylistic choices that hearken to the era of New Romanticism
 uske juute main pair kii ungaliyon ke juute kii yaad taaja, pair kii anguli par upar kii ore jhukaav he
 He has no identity of any kind and no clear information about his real name or background; When he is arrested by the Gotham City Police, he finds only knives and lint in his pockets
 joker ke bal kathor, akushal or range hue hare rang ke hote hai
 His face is covered in a cracker and moving layer of white clown make-up, his eyes broadly raised in black
 ek mailaa laal bhura mechap ke neeche glassgo muskuraahat par chitrit kiya jaataa he, jo munh se gaal tak failata he
 Film critic Peter Travers wrote of the Joker, "yellow hair and yellow teeth of fresh hair from hell"
 charitra ke tareeke main apratyashitata kii gunvattta hoti he

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm ek dharm he jiske anuyaayi adhikanshtah bharat ,nepal or morishas main bahumat main hai
 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent

 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai
 Five major deities are revered in Hinduism beliefs
 ye ek ishwar ke hi alag-alag rup or shaktiyaan hai
 Jupiter is considered the guru of the gods
 puranic manyataon ke anusaar ve maharishi angira ke putr the
 He attained the position of Devguru through the hard tenacity of Lord Shiva
 unhone apane gyaan bal va mantra shaktiyon se devataaon kii raksha kii
 He is also revered as a Guru planet by the grace of Shiva
 guuruuvaar, guru brihaspatidev kii upasna kaa vishesh din he
 Shukracharya, the guru of the demons, is considered
 brahmadev ke putr maharishi bhrigu inke pita the
 It was Shukracharya who received the dead Sanjivani Vidya by performing harsh penance of Shiva, by which he used to burn his life again in the dead body
 brahmadev kii krupa se yah shukr grah ke rup main poojaneey hai
 Friday is the special day of worship of Venus
 hindu dharm ke anusaar har chetan praani main ek abhautik aatma hoti he, jo sanathan, avyakt, aprameya or vikaar rahit he
 According to Hinduism, not only human beings, but every animal and plant, that is, every living being has a soul
 bhagavadgita main bhagwaan shrikrishna dwaara aatma ke lakshan is prakaar bataae gaye hai: In any birth, according to the deeds done freely, the soul assumes the next body
 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina
 janm maran kaa sansaarik chakra tabhi khatm hota he jab vyakti ko moksh miltaa he
 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever
 maanav yoni hi akelaa aisa janm he jisamen manushya ke karm, paap or punyamay fal dete hai or sukarm ke dwaara moksh kii prapti mumkin he
 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai 
 The major Smriti texts are: History - Ramayana and Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, Purana -, Manusmriti, Dharmashastra and Dharmasutra, Agam Shastra
 bhartiya darshan ke 6 pramukh ang hai- sankhya darshan, yoga, nyaay, vaisheshik, mimasaa or veydant
 According to Hindu scriptures, the demons of the deity religion are the symbol of unrighteousness
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki puranic manyataon main dev-daanvon ko ek hi pita, kintu alag-alag maataaon kii santan bataaya gaya he
 According to this, the father of the Devas and Demons is Rishi Kashyapa
 vahiin, devataaon kii mata kaa naam aditi or daanvon kii mata kaa naam diti he
 20 nations with maximum Hindu population in the world pracheen kaal main arya log vaidic mantron or agni-yajna se kai devataaon kii puja karte the
 The Aryans did not make any idols or temples of the gods
 pramukh arya devtaa the : devraj indra, agni, som or varun
 Vedic mantras were read for them and ghee, milk, curd, barley, etc
 were offered in the fire
 prajapati brahma, vishnu or shiv kaa us samay kam hi ullekh miltaa he
 India is a vast country, but we cannot know its greatness and greatness until we see it
 is ore vaise anek mahapurushon kaa dhyaan gaya, lekin aaj se baarah sau varsh pehle aadiguru shankaracharya ne iske liye ek bahut hi mahatvapurn kaary kiya
 He established four benches at the ends of India in four directions, Jyotipitha near Badrinath in the north, Sringeri Peeth near Rameshwaram in the south, Govardhan Peeth in Jagannathpuri in the east and Dwarikapith in the west
 tirthon ke prati hamaare deshavaasiyon main badi bhakthi bhaavana he
 Therefore, by establishing these chairs Shankaracharya gave the countrymen a comfortable opportunity to visit the whole of India
 ye chaaron tirth chaar dham kehalaate he
 People believe that the person who travels to these four dhams gets blessed
 zyaadaatar hindu bhagwaan kii murtiyon dwaara puja karte hai
 For them, the idol is a simple instrument, in which the same formless God can be seen in any beautiful form as he wishes
 hindu log vastav main pathar or lohe kii puja nahin karte, jaisaa ki kuch log samajhate hai
 Idols are merely a means for Hindus to do devotion to God
 hinduon ke upasna sthalon ko mandir kehete hai
 There were no temples during the ancient Vedic period
 tab upasna agni ke sthaan par hoti thi jisamen ek sone kii murti ishwar ke pratik ke rup main sthapit kii jaati thi
 According to one view, due to the worship of Buddha and Mahavira idols and temples by Buddhist and Jain religions, Hindus too started building temples after being influenced by them
 har mandir main ek yaa adhik devataaon kii upasna hoti he
 The idol of the presiding deity is revered in the sanctum sanctorum
 mandir pracheen or madhyayugin bhartiya kala ke shreshthatam pratik hai
 Millions of pilgrims visit the temples every year
 adhikansh hindu chaar shankaraachaaryon ko hindu dharm ke sarvocch dharmaguru maanate hai

 hindu dharm main suryopasna ke liye prasiddh parv he chhath

 It is not necessary for any Hindu to be vegetarian, although vegetarianism is considered a satvic diet
