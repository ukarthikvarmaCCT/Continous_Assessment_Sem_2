 The research of artificial intelligence in computer science is considered the study of "smart agents"
 a smart agent is any plant that tries to achieve its goal by looking at its environment
 Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence / intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics the "cognitive" functions of humans
 This task combines with "learning" and "problem solving"
 kritrim buddhi kaa ar sanganak main arpit buddhi he
 Human also wants to do the work of thinking, analyzing and memorizing the machine in place of his brain

 The scope of artificial intelligence is disputed: as machines are becoming increasingly capable, tasks that were previously intended to require intelligence are no longer covered by "artificial intelligence"
 For example, machines have become so capable of recognizing written words, that it is no longer considered smart
 Nowadays, the tasks that come under the purview of AI are, to understand human voice, to drive a vehicle on its own without any human support, even more than humans who are expert in the game of chess or "go"

 anya shabdon main, yah darshanik yaa saamaanya nitishastra kaa vibhaag hai, jisamen ghatana ko varnit karne ke dhyey se naitik nirnayan prakriya kaa anveshan shaamil hai
 The goal of those working on descriptive ethics is to unveil people's beliefs about certain things, such as values, what actions are right and wrong, and what characteristics of moral agents are virtuous
 varnatmak nitishastra ke bheetar sanshodhan, logon ke naitik aadarshon kii athwa samaaj kin kaaryon ko vidhi yaa raajnneeti main puruskrit yaa dandit karte hai, inaki bhi jaanch kar saktaa hai
 It is worth mentioning that culture is generational and not static
 atah, ek nai peedi apni naitiktaaon kaa samucchy lekar aegi or vah nitishastra ban jayega
 Hence, descriptive ethics will supervise whether ethics is still in place

 sankhya darshan main, prakruti ke teen gun bataae gaye hai - sat, rajas or tamas
 The person does not know anything of truth or untruth when he is the head of all virtues, that is, he lives in the darkness of ignorance
 yani koun si baat uske liye acchhee he vaa koun si buree ye yatharth pataa nahin chalata or is swabhaav ke vyakti ko ye jaanane kii jigyaasa bhi nahin hoti
 The classification between Sattva, Rajas and Tamas is seen in various aspects of Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism, where Tamas is the lowest
 tamas ek shakti hoti he jo ki andhkaar, maut, vinaash or agyanta, susti or pratirodh ko badhaava detii he
 Tamas-effected life results in demerit according to karma; An inferior life-form is demoted
 ek tamsik jivan ko aalasy, laaparvaahee, dwesh, dhokhadhadi, asamvedansheeltaa, aalochana or galati dhundhna, kuntha, lakshyaheen jivan, taarkik soch yaa yojana kii kami or bahaane bananaa, dwaara chihnit kiya jaataa he
 Tamasic activities include eating more food and / or consuming drugs and alcohol
 karm dharm or dharmik dharm kaa kendriya siddhant ke asweekruti ke kaaran yah sabase nakaaratmak gun hota he: kisi ko bhi karm karnaa chahie or usase andekhi nahin karnaa chahie
 The six schools of classical Indian philosophy have a Samkhya in which these qualities are defined and detailed
 teenon gunon main se prayek kii apni vishisht visheshtaayen hai or yah mana jaataa he ki sab kuch in teenon se bana he
 Tamas is the lowest, heaviest, slowest and most dull
 It is devoid of the energy of Rajas and the glow of Sattva
 tamas kaa kabhi bhi tamas dwaara virodh nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be resisted through Rajas and it can be even more difficult to convert directly from Tamas to Sattva

 sorce code se object code compail karnaa aasaan he; yah hameshaa kiya jaataa he or isi tarah program likhaa jaataa he
 But the opposite is that it is impossible to find the source code from the object code, but it is very difficult and expensive

 Some soft contact lenses are made of light blue color so that they are easily visible in cleaning and storage solutions
 Some cosmetic lenses are deliberately colored to change eye appearance
 aaj kal kuch kantact lainson par aankh ke prakritik lens ko yuvi se nuksaan se bachaane ke liye yuvi rakshaatmak satahi prakriya kii jaati he
 It is estimated that 125 million people worldwide use contact lenses, of which 28 to 38 million in the United States and 13 million in Japan
 prayukt or sifarish kiye gaye lainson ke prakaar har desh main bhinn hote hai – japan, netherlands or germany main aajkal sifarish kiye ja rahe lainson kaa 20% se adhik kade lens hote hai, jabaki scandinavia main 5% se bhi kam log iskaa prayog karte hai
 People use contact lenses for several reasons, often showing their appearance and functionality
 chashmon kii tulana main, kantact lainson par nam mausam kaa asar kam hota he, un par bhaap nahin jamati or ve drushti kaa adhik bada kshetra uplabdh karte hai
 They are also suitable for many sports activities
 iske atirikt kerretoconus or enisikonia jaise ankhon ke vikaron ko chashmon se sahi tarah se thik nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Leonardo da Vinci is often credited with presenting the imagery of contact lenses in his 1508 Codex of the Eye, Manuel de
 jisamen unhone pani kii ek katori main aankh ko dubo kar cornia kii takat ko badalane kaa vivaran diya
 But Leonardo did not recommend that his imagination be used to improve vision - he was more interested in the process of eye adjustment
 rene descarts ne 1636 main ek or vichaar pesh kiya, jisamen drav se bhari ek test tub ko cornia ke sidhe sampark main rakhaa jaataa he
 Its embossed head was made of clear glass to improve vision - but the idea was impractical because it was impossible to blink an eyelid

 lekin leonardo kii tarah yang kaa upkaran bhi apvartan ke dosha ko sudhaarney ke liye nahin banaaya gaya tha
 Sir John Herschel in the footnote of the 1845 issue of the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana presented two measures of vision correction - first, a circular capsule of animal jelly-filled glass and a mold of cornea, which could be molded on a transparent medium
 haalanki harchel ne kabhi in vichaaron kaa pareekshan nahin kiya tha, unhen baad main kai swatantra avishkaarakon dwaara aage badhaayaa gaya jaise hungarian dow dailas, jinhone jivit ankhon ke saanche banane kii ek vidhi banaai
 This made it possible to produce the lens for the first time to fit the actual eye shape
 1887 main ek german glassbloar, epa
i
 mullar ne paardarshee or sahanyogy aankh ke pehle aavaran kaa utpaadan kiya
 In 1887, the German optician Adolf Gasten Eugen Fick created and used the first successful contact lens
 jurich main kaam karte samay, unhone affocal scleral kantact shelon ke nirmaan or prayog ke rup main unhen lagane kaa vivaran diya, jo cornia ke chaaron ore utak kii kam samvedansheel kinar par tik jate the – shuru main khargoshon par, phir apane aap par or ant main swayamsevakon ke ek chote se samooh par

 In 1887, Louis J
 Girard invented one such scleral type of contact lens
 1930 ke dashak tak glass-blon scleral lens hi kantact lens ke ekmaatr prakaar rahe, jab polimithil methacrillate kaa vikaas hua, jisase pehali baar plastic scleral lainson kaa utpaadan sambhav hua
 In 1936, optometrist William Fenbloom introduced plastic lenses, which were more lightweight and comfortable
 ye lens kaanch or plastic ke samagam se bane the
 The first corneal lens was developed in 1949
 ye lens mul scleral lainson se kaaphi chote the, kyonki ve aankh kii sari sataha ke bajaay keval cornia par lagaae jate the or pratidin solah ghanton tak pahane rakhe ja sakate the
 The PMMA corneal lenses were the first contact lenses to become popular in the 1960s, with the achievement of superior quality lens designs along with continuous improvement in production technology

 sab milakar in polimaron ko kade gas pargamya yaa arjipi vastuon yaa lainson ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Although all of the above types of lanso — scleral, BMMA lens, and RGP — should actually be called hard or rigid, the term hard is nowadays used for moose BMMA lenses that are still occasionally applied, while the term rigid is a Is the common term that can be used for all these lens types
 arthath hard lens rigid lainson kaa ek upvarg he
 The term gas-permeated is sometimes used for RGP lenses, which is incorrect, as soft lenses are also gas-permeable and oxygen can enter the eye surface through them
 narm lainson main mukhya khoj check chemiston oto victorli or drahoslav lim ne kii jinhone apane kaary jaev upyog ke liye hydrophylic jail kaa prakaashan 1959 main nechar naamak patrika main kiya

 narm lainson se praapt turant aaraam ke kaaran jaldi hi ye lens rigid lainson kii apeksha adhik likhe jane lage – isaki tulana main rigid lainson se puraa aaraam milane main kuch samay lagata he
 Polymers used in the production of soft lenses improved over the next 25 years - mainly by increasing the permeability of oxygen by changing the materials used to make polymers
 In 1972, the British optometrist Rishi Aggarwal first described disposable soft contact lenses

 In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian October Revolution, Finland declared independence and most of the Åland Islands were thought to re-join Sweden

 In 1924 a League of Nations Commission of Inquiry with members from Belgium, Hungary and Sweden was sent to study the region which found that the people of Mosul did not want to be a part of Turkey and if they were asked to choose Iraq they would Choose
 In 1925, the Commission recommended that the region remain part of Iraq, with the condition that the British would have a mandate on Iraq for the next 25 years to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population
 The League Council accepted the recommendation and on 16 December 1925 decided to give Mosul to Iraq

 Mukden's accident, also known as the "manchurian Incident" or "far Eastern Crisis", was one of the Union's major failures, which served as a catalyst for Japan's withdrawal from the organization

 Any type of economic sanctions the Union imposed on its member states would become ineffective, because when a member nation was restricted from doing business with another member state, it would establish trade relations with the United States

 Before June of 1936, although there was no tradition of a prominent figure in the state addressing the Legislative Assembly of the United Nations, the Emperor of Hale Silasi, Ethiopia appealed to the Assembly for help in protecting his country

 In addition, it also clarifies how the League of Nations can be affected by the selfishness of its members; Britain and France also feared a possible alliance between Mussolini and German dictator Hitler due to the ban not being too harsh

 However, the League was unable to provide any practical measures other than a conclusive statement that gave China "spiritual support"
 4 oktober ko, sangh sthagit ho gaya or is vishay ko nau shakti sandhi sammelan ko hastantarit kar diya gaya
 Article eight of the League's covenant gave the League the task to "limit armament to the lowest point that is necessary for national security and the enforcement of international obligations by normal action
" Much of the Union's time and energy was devoted to disarmament, although many member governments were unsure whether such widespread disarmament could be achieved, or even whether it was desirable

 The Union Covenant specified the Union to prepare a disarmament plan for each state, but the Council delegated this responsibility to the Special Commission set up in 1926 to prepare for the World Disarmament Conference of 1932–34

 is guarantee ke bina ve apane shastron ko kam nahin karenge kyonki unhone mahasoos kiya ki germany se akraman kaa khatra bahut zyada tha
 The threat of invasion was further heightened by Germany regaining power after World War I, especially when Hitler gained power and became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, particularly because of Germany's attempt to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German army
 France became reluctant to disarm

 At the outset of the conference, it was proposed to put a year's break on the extension of arms, which was later extended a few months

 vastav main, sangh ke sadasyon ne swayan ko punah-sanyeekrut kiya
 In 1933, Japan, instead of accepting the decision of the Union, easily disengaged from it, as did Germany in 1933 and Italy in 1937
 In Denzing, the Union Commissioners were unable to consider the German claim on the city, which in 1939 became an important reason for the outbreak of World War II

 The onset of World War II showed that the League had failed in its initial objective, which would have avoided any future world war
 Various factors were responsible for this failure, many of which were linked to general weaknesses within the organization
 atirikt rup se, america dwaara sangh main shaamil hone kii manaahi ne sanghathan kii shakti ko simit kiya
 The emergence of the League as an organization was carried out by the Allies as part of peace efforts to end World War i and was therefore seen as a "union of Conquerors"
 isane sangh ko varsay kii sandhi se bhi baandh diya, jisase jab sandhi apratishthit evam alokapriy ho gaya, yah rashtrasang main bhi pratibimbit hua
 The so-called neutrality of the union expressed it as indecision

 It was also slow to come to its decisions as some decisions required unanimous approval of the entire assembly

 Representation in the union was often a problem
 haalanki iskaa abhisht sabhi rashtron ko shaamil karnaa tha, kai kabhi shaamil nahin hue, yaa unki sangh ke saath saajhedaari bahut choti thi
 The most notable absence was the possibility of America's role in the League, not only would it secure world peace and security but also finance the Union
 US President Woodrow Wilson was the driving force behind the creation of the Union and strongly influenced its size, but the American Senate voted on 19 November 1919 not to join it
 routh heaning ne suzav diya ki yadi america sangh kaa sadsy hota to, isane france evam britain ko bhi prishth-samarthan diya hota, sambhavatya france zyada surakshit mahasoos karata evam aisa protsaahan france evam britain ko germany ke sambandh main zyada sahyog karne detaa evam isse naaji party kaa udai kam sambhav hota
 Conversely, Henning acknowledges that if the US had been a member of the Union, its reluctance to engage in war with European powers and enacting economic sanctions would have impeded the Union's ability to withstand international events

 In January 1920, when the Confederacy began, Germany was not allowed to join as it was seen as offensive in the First World War
 soviet rus bhi prarambh main sangh se bahishkrut tha, kyonki pratham vishwa yuddh ke vijetaon ko communist vichaar pasand nahin tha
 The League was further weakened when important powers abandoned it in the 1930s
 japan ne sthaayee sadsy ke rup main parishad main shuru kiya, lekin 1933 main tab hat gaya jab sangh ne iske china ke manchuriya kshetra par akraman kaa virodh kiya
 Italy also started as a permanent member of the council but withdrew in 1937
 sangh ne germany ko 1926 main sadsy ke rup main sweekaar kiya, ise “shanti premi desh” mana, lekin adolf hitler 1933 main jab satta main aayaa to germany ko isse alag kar liya
 Another significant weakness developed from the contradiction between the idea of collective security, which was the basis of the League and international relations between individual nations

 For this, by wrapping the wire on the iron, the iron can be magnetized by flowing the current through that wire
 san 1820 i
 main astand ne avishkaar kiya ki vidyut dhara kaa prabhaav chumbakon par padataa he
 It was then that the same year that Arengo invented the iron and steel pieces magnetized near it due to the effect of the current flowing in the copper wire
 usee saal oktober maheene main sar hanferi davy ne swatantra rup se isi tathy kaa avishkaar kiya
 In 1825, William Sturgeon of England built the first electromagnet, which could carry a load of about 4 kg
 inhone lohe kii chad ko ghode ke naal ke rup main modakar usapar vidyutarodhi taar lapeta
 The rod magnetized as electric current flowed into the wire, and the magnetism of the rod disappeared as it stopped
 yahan chad ke ek sire se duusare sire tak taar kaa ek hi disha main lapetate jate hai, kintu siron ke saamne se dekhne se mudi hui chad kii ek bahu par dhara vamavart disha main chakkar katati he or duusari bahu par dakshinavart disha main
 As a result, one end of the rod becomes the north pole and the other the south pole
 sterjan ke prayogon se prerit hokar san 1831 main america ke jojef henry ne shaktishaalee vidyut chumbakon kaa nirmaan kiya
 He increased the power of the electromagnet by increasing the number of wires around the iron rod
 unhone jo pehla chumbak banaaya yah 350 kilo kaa bhaar uthaa saktaa tha or iske baad unhone jo doosraa vidyut chumbak banaaya, vah 1,000 kilogram kaa bhaar uthaa saktaa tha
 Their electric magnets received the above strong magnetism from the current of several cell batteries
 iske baad to isse bhi shaktishaalee vidyut chumbakon kaa uttarottar nirmaan hota gaya
 In 1891, du Boye built a large electric magnet
 is vidyut chumbak ke crode par taar ke 2,400 phere lapete gaye or jab taar se 50 ampiore kii vidyut dhara pravaahit kii gai, to is vidyut chumbak ke bich 40 hajaar gouse kaa prabal chumbakeey kshetra utpann hua
 The poles of this electric magnet were cone shaped and facing each other
 dhruvon ke bich kii khaali jagah kii lambaai 1 mimi or vyas 6 mimi tha
 The largest magnet that Du Bias made was weighing 27 hundredweight and produced a magnetic field of 65 thousand gauss in a space of 3 mm long and 0
5 mm in diameter between its poles
 pi
 vaais ne bhi ati balashaali vidyut chumbakon kaa nirmaan kiya
 An electric magnet made by him had 1,440 rounds of copper nozzles and a current of 100 amperes was shed from it
 nalika ke andar se pani bahaakar use thandha rakhaa jaataa tha
 Doo Boy's electromagnet also had wires wrapped in a hollow tube and kept cool by pouring water inside the tube
 vidyut chumbak ke crode ke liye aise lohe kaa vyavhaar hota he jisaki chumbakeey pravriti unchi ho, chumbakan dhara band kar dene par crode kaa avshesh chumbakatv nimnatam ho or vah sheeghra hi chumbakeey santrutti na praapt kare
 Pitted iron, or molded soft steel, is used for the electrode's core
 kintu kisi bhi prakaar ke lohe kaa vyavhaar kiya jaae, uskaa chumbakatv ek nishchit seemaa ko nahin paar kar saktaa, chaahe chumbakan dhara ko kitna bhi kyon na badhaayaa jaae
 Therefore, Kapitza treated the wire as a solenoid, the core being air, to generate a very strong magnetic field
 is parinalika main ek prabal janitr se 8,000 ampiore kii kshanik dhara 3 / 1000 second tak pravaahit kar us parinalika ke andar 3,20,000 gouse kaa chumbakeey kshetra utpann kiya
 Electrical magnets are used to carry heavy loads in factories
 jis boj ko uthaanaa hota he, usapar lohe kii patari band dete hai
 As the current flows through the electromagnet, the electromagnet magnetizes and lifts the load on the iron rails and rails
 kisi vidyut chumbak kaa boj uthaane kaa yah bal aage diye gayi sutron kii sahaayta se nikaala ja saktaa he
 Electric magnets have been very important in scientific research
 vidyut chumbak kii sahaayta se farede ne prakaash sambandhi farede-prabhaav, jeman ne zemaan-prabhaav or ker ne ker-prabhaav kaa avishkaar kiya

 Virtual memory differs from virtualization of memory in the sense that virtual memory allows resources to be virtualized for a particular system
 iske vipareet memory kaa ek bada pool vibhinn pranaaliyon ke liye chote pulon main abhaasikrut hota he
 Note that "virtual memory" does more than "increase the size of physical memory using disk space" - that is, simply expand the memory hierarchy to include hard disk drives
 The expansion of disk memory is a natural consequence of using virtual memory technology, but can be done by other means such as overlay or swapping programs and their idle data from the disk altogether

 Modern general-purpose computer operating systems typically use virtual memory technologies as common applications such as word processors, spreadsheets, multimedia players, accounting, etc
 except where necessary hardware support is unavailable
 Older operating systems such as the 1980s DOS, 1960s mainframes generally had no virtual memory-related practicality — notable exceptions being the Atlas, B5000, and Apple Computer Lisa

 In the 1940s and 1950s, before the development of a virtual memory, all large programs included logic for managing two-tier storage, such as overlay technologies
 The program was responsible for moving overlaps from secondary storage to primary storage

 Many systems already had the ability to divide memory into multiple programs that were provided for early models of the PDP-10 by providing a "base and bound register" for example without providing virtual memory
 usne prayek aplikeshan ko ek ek nijee adressthaan pradaan kiya jo 0 ke ek pate par prarambh hota tha
 With this, the bound register of an address in the private address space was checked to ensure that it is within the allocated memory block for the application and, if so, the corresponding base register to keep an address in main memory

 By 1969, the debate over virtual memory for business computers was over
 david cyre ke netritv main IBM ke ek shodh dal ne yah dikhaaya ki virtual memory uparishayi pranali ne sarvshereshth hast niyantrit pranaaliyon kii tulana main nirantar behatar kaam kiya
 Norway's NORD-1 was probably the first mini-computer to introduce virtual memory behavior
 1970 ke dashak ke dauraan, anya mini computaron ne virtual memory, vishesh rup se VMS par chalane vaale VAX modelon ko lagu kiya
 Virtual memory was implemented with the x86 architecture with the protected mode of the Intel 80286 processor
 shuru main ise khand gamagaman ke saath kiya gaya, jo adhik bade khandon ke saath bekaar sabit hua
 Intel 80386 introduced support for paging below the current partition layer
 Page fault exceptions can be chained with other exceptions without causing a double fault
 virtual memory ke praaia: sabhi karyanvayan kisi aplikeshan program ke virtual adress spes ko pejon main vibhajit karte hai; pej sanlagn virtual memory adreson kaa ek block hota he
 Page sizes are typically at least 4K bytes, and systems with large virtual memory addresses or very large volumes of real memory typically use large-sized pages
 lagbhag sabhi karyanvayan aplikeshan program ke dwaara dekhe gayi virtual adreson ko bhautik adreson main roopaantarit karne ke liye prishth sarini kaa prayog karte hai jinka upyog hardware ke dwaara nirdeshon ko sansaadhit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Each entry in the page table contains either a mapping to the actual memory address for the virtual page where the page is stored, or a pointer to whether the page is currently placed in a disk file
 pranaaliyon main puri pranali ke liye ek prishth vaali sarini yaa prayek aplikeshan ke liye alag-alag prishth sarini ho sakati he
 If there is only one, different applications running at the same time use the same virtual address space simultaneously, that is, they use different parts of the same sequence of virtual addresses
 jo pranaliyaan ekaadhik prishth saraniyon kaa upyog karti hai ve ekaadhik virtual adress spes pradaan karti hai - samavarti aplikeshan kaa sochna he ki ve saamaan anukram vaale virtual adreson kaa upyog kar rahe hai, lekin unke alag- alag prishth sarini vibhinn vaastavik adreson kii taraf anupreshit claarate hai
 If, at the time of executing an instruction, a CPU receives an instruction located in a particular virtual address, fetches data from a specific virtual address, or stores data in a particular virtual address, the virtual address is the corresponding physical Must be converted to address
 This is done by a hardware component, sometimes called a memory management unit
 yah virtual adress ke sangat vaastavik adress kii khoj karata he or or vaastavik adress ko CPU ke bhaagon main bhej detaa he jo nirdeshon par amal karte hai
 If the page table indicates that the virtual memory page is not currently in real memory, the hardware generates a page fault exception that starts the paging supervisor component of the operating system
 oparating system kaa yah bhaag prishth sarini ko taiyaar karata he or uskaa prabandhan karata he
 If the dynamic address conversion hardware generates a page fault exception, searches for page space in the secondary storage of a page with the required virtual address, reads it in real physical memory, to display the new location of the virtual address of the page table
 Upgrades and finally tells the dynamic address conversion to start searching again
 aamtaur par sabhi vaastavik bhautik memory pehle se hi upyog main rahete hai or prishthan paryvekshak ko sabase pehle vaastavik bhautik memory ke ek hisse ko discs main avashya hi seve karen or prishth sarini kaa navinikaran karen taaki yah bataaya ja sake ki sambandhit virtual adress ab vaastavik bhautik memory main nahin he balki discs main seve kiye gaye hai
 Paging observers typically save and override parts of real physical memory that have been used recently, as these are probably the areas that are used less often
 isliye har baar gatik adress roopantaran hardware kaa ek vaastavik bhautik memory vaale adress ke saath sumelan hone par, ise us virtual adress ke liye prishth talika pravishti main samay kaa ek muhar lagaana chahie
 All virtual memory systems have memory areas that are "clogged", meaning they cannot be moved to secondary storage, for example: MVS, z / OS or isi tarah ke oses main, system memory ke kuch hisson kaa prabandhan virtual = vaastavik vidhi main kiya jaataa he, jahaan prayek virtual adress ek vaastavik adress ke sangat hota he
 They are: ibiem ke aarambhik virtual memory system virtual = vaastavik mod pejon ko jakadane kaa ek maatr tarika tha
 z / OS has 3 modes, v = V, v = r and v = F
 kuch pranaliyaan, jaise kii barroj large system, virtual memory ke karyanvayan ke liye prishthan kaa prayog nahin karte hai
 Instead, they use segmentation, so that the virtual address space of an application can be divided into segments of variable length
 a virtual address has a chunk number and an offset within the chunk
 memory ko ab bhi ek hi sankhya ke dwaara bhautik rup se vyakt kiya jaataa he
 To achieve this, the processor searches for the segment number in the segment table to search for a segment descriptor
 khand vivarnak main ek chinhak hota he jo yah suchit karata he ki kya khand mukhya memory main upasthit he or, yadi aisa he, to khand ke shuru main mukhya memory main adress or khand kii lambaai suchit karata he
 It checks whether the offset offset length within the segment is less than the segment length and, if not, whether a blockage occurs
 yadi koi khand mukhya memory main maujuud nahin rahata he, to oparating system main hardware sambandhi ek avrodh utpann utpann kiya jaataa he, jo mukhya memory main khand ko padhane yaa karyanvayan ke dauraan prishthankit aankadon ke set ko sahaayak storage se vaastavik storage main sthanantarit karne kii koshish kar saktaa he
 To make space in the main memory for the section to be read, the operating system may designate removing other blocks from the main memory
 vishesh rup se, intel 80286 ne ek vikalp ke rup main isi prakaar kii ek vibhaajan yojana kaa samarthan kiya, lekin adhikansh oparating systamon dwaara iskaa upyog nahin kiya gaya
 It is possible to combine segmentation and paging, usually dividing each section into pages
 jo system unhen sammishrit karte hai, jaise ki Multics or IBM System / 38 or IBM System i mashin main, virtual memory ko aamtaur par prishthan ke saath lagu kiya jaataa he, jisamen vibhaajan kaa prayog memory ko suraksha pradaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 With Intel 80386 and later IA-32 processors, the segments are located in a 32-bit linear paging address space
 isliye khandon ko us raikhik prishthan vaale aderes spes ke bheetar or baahar kiya ja saktaa he
 This gives two stars of virtual memory; However, very few operating systems do this
 iske bajaay, ve keval prishthan kaa upyog karte hai
 The difference in the implementation of virtual memory using pages and segments is not only related to the partitioning of memory by fixed and variable sizes respectively
 kuch pranaaliyon main, jaise ki multics, yaa baad main system / 38 or praim machines main, ek memory model ke arth vigyaan ke rup main, vibhaajan vastav main upyogkarta prakriyaaon main dikhaai detaa tha
 In other words, in exchange for a process that contained a memory that looked like a large vector of bytes or words
 yah adhik sanrachit tha
 This is different from using pages, which does not change the model seen in the process
 iske mahatvapurn parinaam hue
 The section was not only "a page with variable length", or a straightforward way to increase the length of address space
 In Multix, partitioning was a very powerful mechanism used to provide a one-tier virtual memory model, with no differences between "process memory" and "file system" - in a 'process active address space' There was only a list of segments that were mapped to both its possible address, code and data
 yah unics main baad ke mmap kriyavidhi ke samaan nahin tha, kyonki arddh - swecch sthanon main filon ko pratichitrit karne ke samay antar fil pointer sanket kaam nahin karte hai
 Multix had such addressing modes built into most instructions
