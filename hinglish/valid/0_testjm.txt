 This was an unusual event in the history of the Union
 prachaar madhyamon or sangh ke aalochakon kii aankhe is drishy ko dekhakar fatty kii fatty rah gayin
 He could not believe that any non-maharashtrian Abraham of North India could reach the pinnacle of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on which he has been imposing the image of the monopoly of Maharashtrian Brahmins till now - that too unanimously
 rajju bhaiya kaa sharir us samay rogagrast or shithil tha kintu unhone praan-pan se saunpe gayi daayitv ko nibhaane kaa ji-tod prayaas kiya
 But how long could one be taken away from his body which was severely broken by non-working and social thinking
 atev san 1999 main hi unhone us daayitv kaa bhaar kisi kam umr ke vyakti ko saunpane kaa man bana liya
 And finally, after waiting for a year, respecting the earnest request of his colleagues, in March 2000, he handed over this responsibility to Sudarshanji and presented a model to the Union for voluntary retirement
 rajju bhaiya kii 60 varsh lambi sangh-yatra keval is drushti se hi asaamaanya nahin he ki kis prakaar ve ek ke baad doosraa bada daayitv safaltaapurvak nibhaate rahe apitu is drushti se bhi he ki 1943 se 1966 tak ve prayag vishvavidhyalay main adhyaapan kaary ke saath-saath ek purnakalik prachaarak kii bhanti yatra-tatra-sarvatra ghoomte hue samast dayitvon kaa nirvaah karte rahe
 In order to increase their capacity for union work, they did not depend on three years of traditional training in union education class

 He did the third year in 1957 when he was handling the responsibility of a big province like Uttar Pradesh
 is baat se spasht he ki unhone teen varsh ke prashikshan kii aupchaarikta kaa nirvaah sangh ke anya swayamsevakon ke sammukh yogya udhaaharan prastut karne ke liye kiya apane liye yogyata arjeet karne ke liye nahin
 Even while teaching in Prayag University, he was busy campaigning in union work
 aupchaarik taur par unhen prachaarak 1958 main ghoshit kiya gaya par sachaai yah he ki unhone kaarywah pad ko prachaarak kii bhoomika swayan pradaan kar di
 Rajju Bhaiya was one of the most popular and successful professors of Prayag University due to his very simple and interesting teaching style and affection towards his disciples, besides possessing unusual authority on esoteric subjects like physics
 varishthata or yogyata ke kaaran unhen kai varshon tak vibhaag ke adhyaksh-pad kaa daayitv bhi professor ke saath-saath sanbhaalanaa padaa
 But in spite of all this, they continued to fulfill their duties in the union work
 reader yaa professor banane kii koi kaamana unke man main kabhi nahin jaagi
 The days when he was asked to apply for the post of Reader of Physics Department in Prayag University, he did not give the application
 sahyogiyon ne poocha ki rajju bhaiya! aapane aisa kyon kiya? to unhone bade sahaj dhang se uttar diya- "are meraa jivan-kaary to sangh-kaary he, vishvavidhyalay kii professori nahin
 Right now i take classes four days a week, three days i visit for union work
 kabhi-kabhi bahut koshish karne par bhi vishvavidhyalay samay par nahin pahunch paata
 Right now all the teachers of the department support me, but if i become a candidate on the post of reader, then they will start thinking of me as their competitor
 isliye kyon is pachade main fasana
 "rajju Bhaiya's entire life is a witness to the fact that he has never had any aspiration or desire for the post
 vishvavidhyalay main adhyaaapak rah kar bhi unhone apane liye dhanarjan nahin kiya
 They used to spend every pie of their salary on union work
 sampann parivaar main janm lene, public skulon main shiksha paane, sangeet or cricket jaise khelon main ruchi hone ke baad bhi ve apane upar kam se kam kharch karte the
 He was a rare example of austerity
 varsh ke ant main apane vetan main se jo kuch bachataa use guru-dakshina ke rup main samaaj ko arpit kar dete the
 Once Rashtradham Prakashan got stuck in the economic crisis, he urged his father to repay Rashtradharma Prakashan by giving his share money
 yah thi unki sarvatyagi sannyast vritti kii abhivyakti! Rajju Bhaiya was dear to everyone due to selfless affection and unselfish work
 sangh ke bheetar bhi or baahar bhi
 He also gained the trust and affection of politicians like Purshottam Das Tandon and Lal Bahadur Shastri as well as saints like Prabhudatta Brahmachari
 bahut samvedansheel ant:karan ke saath-saath rajju bhaiya ghor yathartwaadee bhi the
 He used to say anything unacceptable to anyone and it was difficult to avoid his talk
 apatkaal ke baad janata party kii sarkaar main jab nanaaji deshmukh ko udyog mantri kaa pad dena nishchit ho gaya to rajju bhaiya ne unase kaha ki nanaaji agar aap, atalji or adwaniji - teenon sarkaar main chale jaayenge to baahar rahakar sanghathan ko koun sanbhaalega? nanaaji ne unki ichha kaa aadar karte hue turant mantripad thukraa diya or janata party kaa mahasachiv bananaa sweekaar kiya
 Whether it is Atalji, or Advaniji; Be it Ashokji Sinhala, or Dattopant Thengdiji - every top leader respected Rajju Bhaiya's talk; Because there was no sense of selfishness, notoriety or factionalism behind him
 is drushti se dekhen to rajju bhaiya sachmuch sangh-parivaar ke na keval bodhi-vriksh apitu sabko jodne vaali kadi the, naitik shakti or prabhaav kaa strot the
 With his departure, not only the Sangh but an era has come to an end in the public life of India

 He was a true figure of self-determination, determination and idyllic idealism
 isliye rajju bhaiya sabhi ke ant:karan main sadaiv jivit rahenge

 Like other transformers, the current transformer has two windings
 - praathmik or dwitiyak 
 The primary is usually a turn
 yadi primary main keval ek turn ho or secondary main n turn to secondary main dhara kaa maan primary kii dhara ke maan kaa 1 / n hota he
 CT is used where it is impractical to measure directly by measuring instruments when the current value is very high
 dhara parinamitra adhik parinaam kii dhara ke samaanupati kam parinaam kii dhara detaa he jise kisi ameter main jodakar sidhe dhara kaa maan padhaa ja saktaa he
 By adding a resistance of a small value in secondary, the current is converted into a voltage that can be given for control or protection in a control circuit

 Karna is one of the most prominent characters in the Mahabharata
 karn ko mahabharat kaa mahanayake mana jaataa he 
 Karna was the best Dharnudhari of Mahabharata
 bhagwaan krishna or bhagwaan parashuramne swayan karnaki shreshthata ko swikaar kiya tha 
 Karna's real mother was Kunti
 karn kaa janm kunti kaa pandu ke saath vivaah hone se purv hua tha
 Karna was Duryodhana's best friend and he fought against his brothers in the war of Mahabharata
 vah surya putr tha
 Karna is considered to be an ideal donor as Karna never refuses to give anything to a seeker in charity even if it results in his own life
 karn kii chhavi aaj bhi bhartiya janamanas main ek aise mahayoddha kii he jo jeevanabhar pratikul paristhitiyon se ladata rahaa
 Many people also believe that Karna never got everything he was actually entitled to
 tarksangat rup se kaha jaae to hastinapur ke singhaasana kaa vaastavik adhikari karn hi tha kyonki vah kuru rajpariwaar se hi tha or yudhisthir or duryodhana se jyeshtha tha, lekin uski vaastavik pahchaan uski mrityu tak agyaat hi rahi
 Karna is considered a great warrior and great warrior
 karn kaa janm kunti ko mili ek vardaan swarup hua tha
 While she was a virgin, Durvasa Rishi once visited her father's palace
 tab kunti ne puure ek varsh tak rishi kii bahut achche se seva kii
 Pleased with Kunti's service, she saw from her divine vision that Pandu could not give birth to her and gave her the boon that she could produce children from any god by remembering him
 ek din utsukathavash kunarepan main hi kunti ne surya dev kaa dhyaan kiya
 From this, the Sun God appeared and gave him a son who was similar to the Sun in Tej and he was born with armor and helix that were clinging to his body since birth
 chunki vah abhi bhi avivaahit thi isaliye lok-laaj ke dar se usne us putr ko ek bakse main rakh kar gangaji main baha diya
 this karn gangaji main bahata hua ja rahaa tha ki maharaj dhritarashtra ke sarathi adhirath or unki patni radha ne use dekha or use god le liya or uskaa laalan paalan karne lage
 They named him Vasusen
 apni paalankarta mata ke naam par karn ko radhey ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Even after the revelation of his birth and being made the king of Anga, Karna always considered him as his parent and practiced all the son's religions till his death
 ang kaa raja banaae jane ke pashchaat karn kaa ek naam angaraj bhi hua
 From a very young age, Karna was more interested in warfare than in chariot like his father Adhirath
 karn or uske pita adhirath acharya dron se mili jo us samay yudhkala ke sarvshereshth aacharyon main se ek the
 Dronacharya used to teach Kuru princes at that time
 unhone karn ko shiksha dene se manaa kar diya kyonki karn ek sarathi putr tha or dron keval kshatriyon ko hi shiksha diya karte the
 After Dronacharya's dissent, Karna approached Parasurama, who used to teach only Brahmins
 karn ne swayan ko brahman bataakar parashuram se shiksha kaa aagrah kiya
 Parashurama accepted Karna's request and mastered Karna in the same manner of warfare and archery
 is prakaar karn parashuram kaa ek atyant parishramee or nipun shishy bana
 Karna was cursed by his guru Parashurama and Prithvi Mata
 iske atirikt bhi karn ko bahut se shraap mili the
 Karna's education was in its final stages
 ek dopaher kii baat he, guru parashuram karn kii jangha par sir rakhkar vishram kar rahe the
 After some time a scorpion came from somewhere and bitten on his other thigh and started making wounds
 guru kaa vishram bhang naa ho isliye karn bichchhu ko dur naa hataakar uske dank ko sahataa rahaa
 In some time Guruji's sleep broke and he saw that a lot of blood was flowing from Karna's thigh
 unhonen kaha ki keval kisi kshatriya main hi itani sahansheeltaa ho sakati he ki vah bichchhu dank ko sah le, naa ki kisi brahman main or parashuramji ne use mithyaa bhaashan ke kaaran shraap diya ki jab bhi karn ko unki di hui shiksha kii sarvaadhik aavashyaktaa hogi, us din vah uske kaam nahin aegi
 Karna, who himself did not know from which clan he belonged, apologized to his guru and said that if he had another disciple in his place, he would have done the same
 yadhyapi karn ko krodhvash shraap dene par unhen glani hui par ve apana shraap waapas nahin le sakate the
 Then he gave Karna his bow called Vijay and blessed him that he would get what he wanted most - indelible fame
 kuch lokkathaon main mana jaataa he ki bichchhu ke rup main swayan indra the, jo uski vaastavik kshatriya pahchaan ko ujagar karnaa chaahate the
 After Parashuramaji left the ashram, Karna wandered for some time
 is dauraan vah shabdabhedi vidya sikh rahaa tha
 During the practice, he considered the calf of a cow to be an endemic animal and shot a waggon at him and the calf was killed
 tab us gaay ke swami brahman ne karn ko shraap diya ki jis prakaar usne ek asahaay pashu ko maaraa he, vaise hi ek din vah bhi maaraa jayega jab vah sabase adhik asahaay hoga or jab uskaa sara dhyaan apane shatru se kahin alag kisi or kaam par hoga
 According to the folk tales of Andhra, once Karna was going somewhere, then on the way he found a girl who was crying due to ghee being shattered from her pit
 jab karn ne uske santraas kaa kaaran jaananaa chaha to usne bataaya ki use bhay he ki uski sauteli maan uski is asaavadhaanee par rusht hongi
 Kripalu Karna then told him that Bah will bring him new ghee
 tab kanya ne aagrah kiya ki use vahi mitti main mila hua ghi hi chahie or usne nayaa ghi lene se manaa kar diya
 Then, taking pity on the girl, Karna took the clay containing the ghee in her hand and started squeezing it so that the ghee from the soil squeezed and fell into the pitcher
 is prakriya ke dauraan usne apane haath se ek mahila kii pidayukta dhwani suni
 When he opened his fist, he found Mother Earth
 pidaa se krodhit dharti mata ne karn kii aalochana kii or kaha ki usne ek bacchee ke ghi ke liye unhen itani pidaa di
 And then Mother Earth cursed Karna that one day in a decisive battle of her life, she will also hold the wheel of her chariot as she has caught them in her fist, so that she is vulnerable to her enemy in that war
 Will go
 is prakaar, karn ko teen pruthak avasaron par teen shraap mili
 Unfortunately, these three curses flourished in the decisive battle of Kurukshetra, when he became unarmed, chariotless and helpless in battle
 karn ko mili vividh shraapon kaa prabhaav is prakaar hua
 If a Brahmastra is also left on the enemy's camp, it not only destroys that camp but also causes famine in that area for more than 12 years
 or yadi do brahmastra aapas main takaraa die jaaen tab to maano pralay hi ho jaataa he
 This will lead to destruction of the entire earth and thus another planet and all living beings will have to be created
 mahabharat ke yuddh main do brahmastron ke takaraane kii sthiti tab ai jab rishi vedavyasji ke ashram main ashwatthama or arjuna ne apane-apane brahmastra chalaa die
 Then Vedavyasa avoided that confrontation and asked to return his Brahmastras
 arjuna ko to brahmastra lautaanaa aata tha, lekin ashwatthama ye nahin jaanata tha or tab us brahmastra ke kaaran parakshit, uttara ke garbh se mrit paidaa hua
 But due to the curse of Karna Guru Parashuram, he forgot to drive the Brahmastra, otherwise he must have used his Brahmastra to kill Arjuna in the war and Arjuna also used his Brahmastra to protect himself and the whole earth would have been destroyed
 is prakaar guru parashuram ne karn ko shraap dekar prithvi kaa vinaash taal diya
 The curse of Mother Earth was that in the most decisive battle of Karna's life, the earth would catch the wheel of his chariot
 us din ke yuddh main karn ne alag-alag rathon kaa upyog kiya, lekin har baar uske rath kaa pahiyaa dharti main dhas jaataa
 Therefore, Karna could not escape the curse of Mother Earth even by using various chariots, otherwise it would have fallen heavily on Arjuna in that decisive war
 guru dronacharya ne apane shishyon kii shiksha puri hone par hastinapur main ek rangabhumi kaa aayojan karavaaya
 In Rangbhoomi, Arjuna became a disciple with special archery
 tabhi karn rangabhumi main aayaa or arjuna dwaara kiye gaye kartabon ko paar karke use dvandvayuddh ke liye lalakaara
 When did Kripacharya reject Karna's duel and ask him about his dynasty and empire - because according to the rules of the duel only a prince could challenge Arjuna, the prince of Hastinapur, for a duel
 tab kauravon main sabase jyeshtha duryodhana ne karn ko angadesh kaa raja ghoshit kiya jisase vah arjuna se dvandvayuddh ke yogya ho jaae
 When Karna asks Duryodhana what he wants from him in return, Duryodhana says that he only wants Karna to become his friend
 is ghatana ke baad mahabharat ke kuch mukhya sambandh sthapit hue, jaise duryodhana or karn ke bich sudrudh sambandh bane, karn or arjuna ke bich teevr pratidwandvita or pandavon tathaa karn ke bich vaimnasy
 Karna was a loyal and true friend of Duryodhana
 yadhyapi vah baad main duryodhana ko prasann karne ke liye dyutakrida main bhagidaari karata he, lekin vah armbh se hi iske viruddh tha
 Karna did not like Shakuni and always recommended Duryodhana to use his fighting skills and muscle to defeat his enemies and not devious tricks
 jab laakshagrih main pandavon ko maarane kaa prayaas vifal ho jaataa he, tab karn duryodhana ko uski kaayarta ke liye daantata he or kahata he ki kaayron kii sabhi chaalen vifal hi hoti hai or use samajhaata he ki use ek yoddha ke samaan kaary karnaa chahie or use jo kuch bhi praapt karnaa he, use apni veerta dwaara praapt kare
 Karna also assisted Duryodhana in marrying the princess of Chitrangad
 apane swayamvar main usne duryodhana ko asweekaar kar diya or tab duryodhana use balpurvak uthaa kar le gaya
 Then the other kings present there followed him, but Karna single-handedly defeated them all
 parrast raajaaon main jarasandh, shishupal, dantavakr, salve or rukmi ityadi the
 As a compliment to Karna, Jarasandha gave Karna a portion of Magadha
 bhim ne baad main shrikrishna kii sahaayta se jarasandh ko parrast kiya lekin usase bahut pehle karn ne use akele parrast kiya tha
 Karna had revealed the weakness of Jarasandha that his death can only be done by splitting his torso into two pieces
 angaraj banane ke pashchaat karn ne ye ghoshnaa kari ki din ke samay jab vah suryadev kii puja karata he, us samay yadi koi usase kuch bhi maangega to vah manaa nahin karegaa or maangane vaala kabhi khaali haath nahin lautega
 In the war of Mahabharata, Indra and Mother Kunti took advantage of this charity of Karna
 mahabharat ke yuddh ke bich main karn ke senapati banane se ek din purv indra ne karn se sadhu ke bhesh main usase uske kavach-kundal maang liye, kyonki yadi ye kavach-kundal karn ke hi paas rahete to use yuddh main parrast kar paanaa asambhav tha or indra ne apane putr arjuna kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue karn se itnaa bady bhiksha maang lee lekin daanveer karn ne sadhu bhesh main devraj indra ko bhi manaa nahin kiya or indra dwaara kuch bhi vardaan maang lene par dene ke aashwaasan par bhi indra se ye kehete hue ki "dene ke pashchaat kuch maang lenaa daan kii garima ke viruddh he" kuch nahin maanga
 Similarly, mother Kunti was also promised by Danveer Karna that in this great war, his five sons will definitely survive and he will not kill any other Pandava except Arjuna
 or usne vahi kiya, karn ne arjuna ke vadh ke liye devraj indra se indrastra bhi maanga tha
 Karna was a marriage mover in Draupadi's Swayamvara
 anya pratidwandiyon ke vipareet, karn dhanush ko modane or us par pratyancha chadha paane main samarth tha, par jaise hi vah lakshya bhedan ke liye taiyaar hua, tab shrikrishna ke sanket par, draupadi ne karn ko soot-putr bolkar use aisa karne se roak diya
 The Pandavas were also present there in disguise of the Brahmin
 anya rajkumaron or raajaaon ke asafal rahane par arjuna aage badha or safaltaapurvak machhlee kii aankh kaa bhedan kiya or draupadi kaa haath jeet liya
 When Arjuna's identity was revealed later, Karna's sense of rivalry deepened
 karn kabhi bhi shakuni kii pandavon ko chhal-kapat se haraane kii yojanaon se sahamat nahin tha
 He was always in favor of war and always urged Duryodhana to choose the path of war
 yadhyapi vah duryodhana ko prasann karne ke liye dyutakrida ke khel main sammilit hua, jo baad main kukhyat draupadi cheer haran kii ghatana main faleebhoot hua
 When Shakuni won everything from Yudhishthira at Dutikrida by deceit, Draupadi, the Pandavis' patrani, was dragged into the Rajya Sabha by the Dushasanas and, at the instigation of Karna, Duryodhana and his brothers attempted to lose Draupadi's clothes
 karn draupadi kaa apmaan yah kahkar karata he ki jiske stri kaa ek se adhik pati ho vah or kuch nahin balki veshya hoti he
 At the same place, Bhima vows that he alone will kill Duryodhana and all his brothers in battle
 or phir arjuna, karn kaa vadh karne kii pratigya letaa he
 During the exile of the Pandavas, Karna takes over the task of making Duryodhana the emperor of the earth
 karn dwaara deshbhar main sainya abhiyaan chede gaye or usne raajaaon ko parrast kar unase ye vachan liye kii vah hastinapur maharaj duryodhana ke prati nishthavan rahenge anyathaa yudhon main maare jaaegein
 Karna was successful in all the battles
 mahabharat main varnan kiya gaya he ki apane sainya abhiyaanon main karn ne kai yuddh chede or asankhya rajyon or samrajyon ko ajnapaalan ke liye vivash kar diya jinamein hai - kamboj, shaq, keky, avantay, gandhar, madra, trigat, tangan, paanchal, videh, suhmas, ang, wang, nishaad, kaling, vatsa, ashamak, rushik or bahut se anya jinamein mlechh or vanavaasi log bhi hai
 After the peace talks with Duryodhana fail, Shri Krishna goes to Karna, the best warrior of Duryodhana
 vah karn kaa vaastavik parichay use bataaten he, ki vah sabase jyeshtha pandav he or use pandavon kii ore aane kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 Krishna assures him that since he is the eldest Pandava, Yudhishthira will leave the throne for him and he will become a Chakravati emperor
 par karn in sabake baad bhi pandav paksh main yuddh karne se manaa kar detaa he, kyonki vah apane aap ko duryodhana kaa rini samajhataa tha or use ye vachan de chukaa tha ki vah marate dam tak duryodhana ke paksh main hi yuddh karegaa
 He also tells Krishna that as long as he is in favor of the Pandavas who are in favor of truth, his defeat is also certain
 tab krishna kuch udhaas ho jate hai, lekin karn kii nishtha or mitrataa kii prashansa karte hai or uskaa yah nirnay sweekaar karte hai or use ye vachan dete hai ki uski mrityu tak vah uski vaastavik pahchaan gupt rakhenge
 Arjuna's father and Devraj Indra know that Karna will remain invincible and immortal in the battlefield as long as he has his armor and helix, which were on his body since birth
 isliye jab kurukshetra kaa yuddh asann tha, tab indra ne yah thaanee ki vah kavach or kundal ke saath to karn ko yudhakshetra main nahin jane denge
 He planned that when he is worshiping Sun God in the mid-day, he will become a beggar and ask him for his armor
 suryadev indra kii is yojana ke prati karn ko saavdhaan bhi karte hai, lekin vah unhen dhanyavad dekar kahata he ki us samay yadi koi usase uske praan bhi maang le to vah manaa nahin karegaa
 Then Suryadev says that if he is self-composed, then ask for his amoghastra from Indra
 tab apni yojananusaar indradev ek bhikshuk kaa bhesh banaakar karn se uskaa kavach or kundal maang lete hai
 Even after being warned, Karna does not refuse and cheerfully donates his armor
 tab karn kii is daanpriyata par prasann hokar vah use kuch maang lene ke liye kehete hai, lekin karn yah kehete hue ki "daan dene ke baad kuch maang lenaa daan kii garima ke viruddh he", manaa kar detaa he
 Then Indra gives him his powerful weapon, Vasavi, which he could use only once
 iske baad se karn kaa ek or naam vaikartan, padaa, kyonki usne bina sankuchit hue apane sharir se apane kavach-kundal kaat kar daan de die
 When the war of Mahabharata was near, Mother Kunti went to meet Karna and made him aware of his real identity
 vah use bataati hai ki vah unka putr he or jyeshtha pandav he
 She tells him that he calls himself 'kaunteya' and not 'radheya' and then Karna replies that he wants the whole world to know him as Radheya in the name of Naki Kontay
 kunti use kahati hai ki vah pandavon kii ore ho jaae or vah use raja banaaegein
 Then Karna says that many years ago, if they had called him Kaunteya in that Rangbhoomi, then the situation would be very different today
 par ab kisi bhi parivartan ke liye bahut der ho chuki he or ab ye sambhav nahin he
 He further states that Duryodhana is his friend and trusts him a lot and that he cannot betray his trust
 lekin vah mata kunti ko ye vachan detaa he ki vah arjuna ke atirikt kisi or pandav kaa vadh nahin karegaa
 Both Karna and Arjuna have pledged to kill each other and hence the death of either one is certain
 vah kahata he ki unke koi bhi paanch putr jivit rahenge - chaar anya pandav or usamen yaa arjuna main se koi ek
 Karna pleads with his mother to keep their relationship and the matter of his birth a secret till his death
 kunti, karn se ek or vachan maangti he ki vah nagastra kaa upyog keval ek baar kare
 Karna also gives this promise to Kunti
 parinamswaroop baad main kurukshetra ke yuddh main karn ek baar se adhik nagastra kaa prayog nahin kar paata
 Before the Mahabharata war began, Bhishma, who was the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army, refused Karna to participate in the battlefield under his leadership
 yadhyapi duryodhana unase nivedan karata he, lekin ve nahin maanate
 And then Karna comes to the battlefield on the eleventh day after his injuries on the tenth day
 terahave din ke yuddh main, kaurav sena ke pradhan senapati, guru dronacharya dwaara, yudhisthir ko bandi banane ke liye chakravyuuh / padmavyuuh kii rachana kii gai
 On the Pandava side, only Krishna and Arjuna knew the Chakravyuh penetrations
 lekin us din unhen trigat naresh-bandhu yuddh karte-karte chakravyuuh sthal se bahut dur le gaye
 Trigat was a kingdom under Duryodhana
 arjuna-putr abhimanyu ko chakravyuuh main keval pravesh karnaa aata tha, usase nikalnaa nahin, jise usne tab suna tha jab vah apni mata ke garbh main tha or uske pita arjuna uski mata ko yah vidhi samajha rahe the or bich main hi unhen nind aa gai
 But as soon as Abhimanyu entered the Chakravyuh, the Indus King - Jayadratha blocked the entrance and did not allow other Pandavas to enter
 tab shatruchakra main abhimanyu akelaa pad gaya
 He fought valiantly even when alone and he single-handedly defeated the great warriors of the Kaurava army
 karn or duryodhana ne guru dron ke nirdeshaanusaar abhimanyu kaa vadh karne kaa nirnay liya
 Karna shot an arrow and broke Abhimanyu's bow and a wheel of chariot, which caused him to fall to the ground and was attacked by other Kauravas
 is yuddh main abhimanyu maaraa gaya
 At the end of the war, when Arjun learns that Jayadratha has the biggest hand in killing Abhimanyu, he vows that he will kill Jayadratha before the next day's sunset, otherwise he will take fire
 chaudaaven din kaa yuddh avilakshan rup se suryaast ke baad tak chalata rahaa or bhimputra ghatotkach, jo ardh-asur tha, kaurav senaaon kaa bade paimaane par sanhaar karata rahaa
 Usually, Asuras become very powerful during the night
 duryodhana or karn ne veerta se uskaa saamana kiya or usase yuddh kiya
 Finally, when it seemed that on the same night Ghatotkacha would kill the entire Kaurava army, Duryodhana requested Karna to get rid of this problem in some way
 karn ko vivash hokar shakti astr ghatotkach par chalaanaa padaa
 This weapon was given by Devraj Indra to Karna as a tribute to his charity
 lekin karn is astr kaa prayog keval ek baar kar saktaa tha, jiske baad yah astr indra ke paas laut jayega
 Thus, after using the Shakti weapon on Ghatotkacha, he could not later use it on Arjuna
 is din karnaka yuddh bhimse hua tha 
 Bhima challenged Karnako but the plight of Bhima
 karnane bhimko bhumiper ghasita or bhimke sab vastra chhin liye
 Then Karna gave Bhima to life
 phir jab arjunase saamana hua tab bhagwaan krishna arjunako karnake vaishnavastrase bachaa lete he 
 Karna took Arjun, his tirose, but gave life for the sunset
 satrahawein din se pehle tak, karn kaa yuddh arjuna ke atirikt sabhi pandavon se hua
 He also defeated these Pandavas in a one-on-one battle, including Mahabali Bhima
 par mata kunti ko die vachananusaar usne kisi bhi pandav kaa vadh nahin kiya
 Karna raised his victory bow and fired Bhargavastra on Arjuna
 bhargavaastra se karodo yoddha maare gayi or baaki praano kii raksha ke liye arjuna ke paas gayi 
 Arjuna said that it is impossible to abrogate Bhargavastra and if Karna will let him escape then he will run away from war
 krishna ne bhaybheet arjuna ko dekha or sochaa karn jab thak jaayegaa tab arjunako uske saamne laana thik hoga 
 Thinking so much, Krishna made a path of escape for Arjuna
 arjuna ko jaan bachaakar bhaagta dekh karn ne bhargavaastra ko waapas le liya 
 The clock finally arrived in the seventeenth day of war, when Karna and Arjun came face to face
 is shandaar sangram main donon hi baraabar the
 Karna was given a bow called Vijay by his guru Parashurama, which was designed by Vishwakarma himself
 duryodhana ke nivedan par pandavon ke mamaa shalya, karn ke sarathi banane ke liye taiyaar hue
 As a matter of fact, Arjuna's charioteer was Sri Krishna himself and Karna was not to be inferior to Arjuna in any case so that he was surgically requested to become a charioteer because he had all the qualities that a qualified charioteer should have
 ran ke dauraan, arjuna ke baan karn ke rath par lage or uskaa rath kai gaj peeche khisak gaya
 But, when Karna's arrows hit Arjuna's chariot, his chariot slipped away only a few times
 isapar shri krishna ne karn kii prashansa kii
 Surprised at this, Arjuna asked the reason for this praise of Karna, because his arrows were more effective in pushing the chariot back
 tab krishna ne kaha ki karn ke rath par keval karn or shalya kaa bhaar he, lekin arjuna ke rath par to swayan ve or hanuman virajman he or tab bhi karn ne unke rath ko kuch baalist peeche khiskaa diya
 Similarly, Karna cut the bow of Arjuna 13 times
 karn or arjuna ne divine astron ko chalaane ke apane-apane gyaan kaa purna upyog karte hue bahut lambaa or ghamaasan yuddh kiya
 "nagastra" was used by Karna to separate Arjuna from the head
 lekin shri krishna dwaara sahi samay par rath ko bhoomi main thodaa sa dhansa liya gaya jisase arjuna batch gaya
 This led to "nagastra" piercing his crown just above Arjuna's head
 nagastra par upasthit ashwasena naag ne karn se nivedan kiya ki vah us astr kaa dobaaraa upyog kare taaki is baar vah arjuna ke sharir ko bedhta hua nikal jaae, lekin karn mata kunti ko die vachan kaa paalan karte hue us astr ke punah prayog se manaa kar detaa he
 Although the war was getting stale, Karna got entangled when a wheel of his chariot got stuck in the earth
 vah apane ko divine astron ke prayog main bhi asamarth paata he, jaisaa kii uske guru parashuram kaa shraap tha
 Then Karna comes down to take off the wheel of his chariot and pleads with Arjuna to stop running arrows at him for a while, following the rules of war
 tab shrikrishna, arjuna se kehete hai ki karn ko koi adhikaar nahin he ki vah ab yuddh niyamon or dharm kii baat kare, jabaki swayan usne bhi abhimanyu vadh ke samay kisi bhi yuddh niyam or dharm kaa paalan nahin kiya tha
 He further said where his religion had gone when he called the divine-born Draupadi as a prostitute in front of the entire Kuru Rajya Sabha
 dhyut-krida bhawan main uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha
 So now he has no right to talk about any religion or war rules and he told Arjuna that Karna is helpless now so he should kill him
 shrikrishna kehete hai ki yadi arjuna ne is nirnaayak mode par abhi karn ko nahin maaraa to sambhavtah pandav use kabhi bhi nahin maar sakenge or yah yuddh kabhi bhi nahin jeeta ja sakegaa
 Then, Arjuna beheaded Karna using a divine weapon
 karn ke sharir ke bhoomi par girane ke baad ek jyoti karn ke sharir se nikali or surya main samahit ho gai
 After the end of the war, funeral ceremonies were being performed for the dead
 tab mata kunti ne apane putron se nivedan kiya kii ve karn ke liye bhi saare mritak sanskaron ko karen
 When he protested against this by saying that Karna is a Sood son, Kunti revealed the secret of Karna's birth
 tab sabhi pandav bhaiyon ko bhratrihatya ke paap ke kaaran jhatka lagata he
 Yudhishthira is particularly angry with his mother and curses her and all women, that women will not be able to hide any distinction since that time
 yudhisthir or duryodhana, donon karn kaa antim sanskaar karnaa chaahate the
 Yudhishthira's claim was that since he is the junior brother of Karna, this right belongs to him
 duryodhana kaa daawa yah tha kii yudhisthir or anya pandavon ne karn ke saath kabhi bhi bhratruvat vyavhaar nahin kiya isliye ab is samay is adhikaar ko jataane kaa koi auchity nahin he
 Sri Krishna then intervenes and explains to Yudhishthira that the bond of Duryodhana's friendship is stronger, so let Duryodhana perform the last rites of Karna
 jab 18-din kaa yuddh samaapt ho jaataa he, to shrikrishna, arjuna ko uske rath se neeche utar jane ke liye kehete hai
 When Arjuna descends, they take him some distance
 tab ve hanumanji ko rath ke dhvaj se utar aane kaa sanket karte hai
 As Shri Hanuman descends from that chariot, the horse of Arjuna's chariot is consumed alive and the chariot explodes
 yah dekhakar arjuna dahal uthta he
 Sri Krishna then tells him that due to Karna's deadly weapons, this explosion has occurred in Arjuna's chariot
 yah ab tak isliye surakshit tha kyonki us par swayan unki krupa thi or shri hanuman kii shakti thi jo rath ab tak in vinaashkari astron ke prabhaav ko sahan kiye hue tha
 Even today for millions of Hindus, Karna is a warrior who lived a sad life all his life
 use ek mahaan yoddha mana jaataa he, jo saahasik aatmbal yukt ek aisa mahanayake tha jo apane jivan kii pratikul sthitiyon se jujhataa rahaa
 Karna in particular is famous for his charity
 vah is baat kaa udhaaharan bhi he ki kis prakaar anuchit nirnay kisi vyakti ke shreshth vyaktitv or uttam gunon ke rahete hue bhi kisi kaam ke nahin hote
 Karna never got what he was entitled to, but he never stopped trying
 bhishma or bhagwaan krishna sahit karn ke samakalinon ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki karn ek puneatma he jo bahut virale hi maanav jati main prakat hote hai
 He is an ideal for the struggling humanity that mankind should never give up and strive
 karn or arjuna main bahut si samantaayein hai
 Both were the best archers of their time, both competed in the contest to win Draupadi's hand and both had to fight in the war against their brothers
 ek or gaharaa sangyojan yah kii donon hi kauravon se nikatataa se jude hue the, karn mitrataavat or arjuna raktarat
 Their decisions and consequent consequences on them and their families are emphasized as to what is the importance of performing one's duties as stated by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-gītā
 karn ek aise vyaktitv kaa udhaaharan he jo guni, daanveer, nyaaypriy or saahsee tha lekin phir bhi uskaa patan hua kyonki vah adharmee duryodhana ke prati nishthavan tha
 Karna had the five qualities that Draupadi had asked Mahadev as her groom, leaving only one and that was close friendship with Duryodhana
 arjuna va karn main samantaayein or vishamtaayen dono hi thi
 Arjuna got happiness, wealth and maternal love from the beginning, while Karna had to get everything
 arjuna ke paas har wo vastu thi jo uske vijayi banaati lekin karn sarvatha akelaa tha
 It was because of his truth that he got all the curse which he accepted with a curse
 ek vishleshan ke anusaar karn or arjuna ke yuddh ke samay ek aisa avasar aayaa jab arjuna ne itani shakti se ek aisa baan chalaaya jo sidhe karn ke rath par laga or uskaa rath das kadam peeche khisak gaya, is par karn ne bhi itani shakti se ek aisa baan chalaaya jo sidhe arjuna ke rath par laga or uskaa rath do kadam peeche khisak gaya
 When Karna did this, Lord Krishna started praising Karna
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan krishna se karn ki is prashansa kaa kaaran poocha to unhone kaha ki tumhaare rath par tribhuvan kaa bhaar lekar main baitha hoon tathaa tumhaare rath ki dhwaja par swayan hanumanji virajman hai
 It is impossible to move it backward even if it is impossible to move away like a molecule, but even if Karna has moved your chariot two steps back then it is not only a matter of surprise but praise and pride duryodhana ke prati karn ke sneh ke kaaran, yadhyapi anicchhuk rup se, usne apane priy mitra ke pandavon ke prati sabhi kukarmon main uskaa saath diya
 Karna had knowledge of Duryodhana's malicious plans towards the Pandavas
 use yah bhi gyaan tha kii asat ke liye sat se takaraane ke kaaran uskaa patan bhi nishchit he
 While some believe that Karna himself took a soot vessel in his name by using the word 'vaishya' for Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha, some others believe that he was right in his act, because earlier Draupadi had insulted him by calling him a 'sutra' in his swayamvar so that he could not become a competitor in his swayamvar
 phir bhi, abhimanyu ke maare jane main karn kii bhoomika or ek yoddha se anek yoddhaon ke ladane ke kaaran uske ek mahayoddha hone kii chhavi ko kahin adhik kshati pahaunchi or phir usee yuddh main uski bhi vahi gati hui
 According to some interpretations of Mahabharata, it was this act which properly proved that Karna is fighting in favor of unrighteousness in the war and due to this act his misfortune was also determined that he too was likewise by Arjuna
 Will be killed when the weapon is inferior and chariotless and has its back towards Arjuna
 karn ke paas satrahawein din ke yuddh main arjuna kaa vadh karne kaa puraa avasar tha lekin yuddh niyamon kaa paalan karte hue usne arjuna par baan nahin chalaaya kyonki tab tak suryadev ast ho chuke the
 The story of Karna and Arjuna's past birth is described in the Padma Purana
 Once there is a war between Lord Brahma and Mahadev, Mahadev cuts off the fifth head of Brahma
 krodhit brahmadev ke sharir se pasina nikalataa he
 And a brave warrior arises from sweat
 jo swead se janma isliye swedja ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Svedja goes to war with Mahadeva on the orders of Father Brahma
 mahadev bhagwaan vishnu ke paas krodhit brahma dwaara janm lene vaale swedja kaa kuch upaay bataane ko kehete hai
 Lord Vishnu gives birth to a hero with his blood
 rakt se janma isliye use raktaja ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Svedja was born with 1000 armor and Raktaja with 1000 hands and 500 bow
 bhagwaan brahma bhi vishnu se hai utpann huj the isliye swedja bhi bhagwaan vishnu kaa ansh tha
 There is a fierce war between Svedja and Raktja
 swedja, raktaja ke 998 haath cat detaa he or 499 dhanush tod detaa he
 The same blood breaks the 999 armor of Svedja
 raktaja bas haarane hi vaala hota he
 Lord Vishnu understands that he will be defeated by blood
 isliye ve us yuddh ko shant karavaate hai
 Svedaja gives blood to Ravnaja, displaying charity
 bhagwaan vishnu swedja kii javabdehi suryanarayan ko sonpate he, or raktaja kii indradev ko
 He pledges to Indradev that in next life, Raktaja will surely kill his rival Svedja
 dwapar yug main raktaja arjun or samvednaa karn ke rup main janm lete hai
 And Arjun kills his greatest rival, Karna, against the rules of war

 a few days before the war, when Karna came to know that the Pandavas were his brothers, all his ill-will towards him ended, but he fought against the Pandavas because of his allegiance to Duryodhana

 The same has been seen in other Dardi languages

 In some Western Hindi speaking areas, free synergism of 'Z' and 'J' is seen in which the speakers use 'J' and 'Z' as per their choice and sometimes 'Z' or 'J' instead of 'Z'
 Instead of 'Z' they say - lohargv, salt tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke almoda jile kaa ek gaanv he

 Different elements of cow dung bind soil particles by coming in contact with soil, but if these particles are very close to each other or attached then they remove them away, which causes air to enter the soil
 And the roots of plants breathe easily into it
 gobar kaa samuchit laabh khaad ke rup main hi prayog karke paaya ja saktaa he
 As just stated, the most beneficial use of cow dung may be in the form of manure, but due to the lack of burning wood in India, it is used more as fuel

 Dried goats burn well and the food made on them, due to cooking on a sweet flame, is delicious
 kintu gobar kaa uchit evam laabhprad upyog, jaisaa kaha ja chukaa he, khaad ke rup main hi he
 In all rich countries, wherever there are dung animals, manure is made from cow dung and fields are made fertile
 bharat main pehle gobar se khaad banane kii do vidhiyaan prachlit thim, kintu ek teesri vidhi bhi ab prachlit kii ja rahi he
 These methods are as follows: iske liye uchit aakaar ke gadhe, 20-25 foot lambey, 5-6 foot chaude tathaa 3 se lekar 10 foot gahare, khode jate hai or inamen gobar bhar diya jaataa he
 While filling, press it in such a way that no space is left vacant
 gadhe kaa upree bhaag gumbad kii tarah bana lete hai or gobar hi se use lep lete hai, jisase varsha ritu kaa anaavashyak jal usamen ghusane na paae
 After that, leave the fertilizer to be made for about three months
 is vidhi main gadhe kaa taap kabhi 34 degree se upar nahin ja paata, kyonki gadhe main rasinic kriyaayein hawa ke abhaav main simit rahati hai
 In this method, nitrogenous materials are not allowed to come out of the compost

 tah ko phir dabaa diya jaataa he or duusari patali tah us par daal di jaati he jiske taap badhane diya jaataa he
 In this way the pile becomes ten to twenty feet high, which is left in this state for a few months
 is reeti se vishesh laabh yah hota he ki taap badhane par ghaas, mote aadi hanikar paudhon ke beej, jo gobar main upasthit rah sakate hai, nasht ho jate hai
 Thus 5 to 6 tons of manure can be made from each animal

 This method produces a type of gas, which serves as a fuel for lighting, operating machinery and cooking food
 gobar pani kaa mishran kar pachak-yantra main prati din daalate jate hai or nikalne vaali gas se uparokt kaam lete hai
 The specialty of this method is that cow dung is obtained in the form of odorless manure and its useful elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potash etc
 remain safe without being destroyed
 saath saath isse upyogi gas bhi mil jaati he
 It is estimated that a village family, consisting of 4-5 animals, can produce about 70–75 cubic feet of burning gas per day

 Travel guide to India on Wikiatra gangubai hangal hindustani shastreey sangeet kii prakhyat gayika thim
 He played an important role in establishing Khayal singing in independent India
 bhartiya shastreey sangeet kii nabj pakadakar or kiraanaa gharaana kii viraasat ko barkaraar rakhte hue parampara kii aawaaj kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaali gangubai hangal ne ling or jaateey baadhaon ko paar kar va bhukh se lagaataar ladaai karte hue bhi ucch str kaa sangeet diya
 He made his contribution in the field of music for more than half a century

 Gangubai Hangal was born in Shukravaradapete in Dharwad district of Karnataka
 devdasi parampara vaale kevat parivaar main unka janm hua tha
 His music is a story of an incredible struggle about reaching the pinnacle of life
 unhone aarthik sankat, padosiyon dwaara jaateey aadhaar par udayi gai khilli or bhukh se lagaataar ladaai karte hue bhi ucch str kaa sangeet diya
 Gangubai often faced racial commentary in childhood and when she started singing she was called by people who did not see it as a good profession
 puraani peedi kii ek netritvkarta gangubai ne guru-shishy parampara ko barkaraar rakhaa
 She had an innate passion for music and this was visible when she used to run on the road to listen to gramophones in her childhood days and tried to imitate that voice
 apni beti main sangeet kii pratibha ko dekhakar gangubai kii sangitajna maa ne karnataka sangeet ke prati apane lagaav ko dur rakh diya
 He ensured that his daughter learns the best Hindustani classical music from stalwarts such as h Krishnacharya of the music field and the grocer Ustad Sawai Gandharva
 gangubai ne apane guru savai gandharva kii shikshaaon ke bare main ek baar kaha tha ki mere guruuji ne yah sikhaaya ki jis tarah se ek kanjus apane paison ke saath vyavhaar karata he, usee tarah sur kaa istemaal karo, taaki shrota raag kii har baarikiyon ke mahatv ko sanjidagi se samaj sake
 Gangubai's mother Ambabai was a noted singer of Carnatic music
 inhone prarambh main desai krishnacharya or dattopant se shastreey sangeet siikhaa, jiske baad inhone savai gandharva se shiksha lee
 Gangubai was so fond of music that she used to travel 30 km by train to reach her guru's house in Kandagol and would walk on foot next to it
 yahaan unhone bharat ratna se sammanit pandit bhimsen joshi ke saath sangeet kii shiksha lee
 Gangubai, who upheld the tradition of the grocery house, was not in favor of any compromise with the purity of the gharana and its associated style
 gangubai ko bhairav, asavari, todi, bhimpalasi, puria, dhanashri, marva, kedaar or chandrakuns raagon kii gayaki ke liye sabase adhik vaahvahee mili

 Comparison of two measurements is called calibration
 inamen se pehla maapan gyaat shuddhta vaale maapak yantra se napa gaya hota he yaa gyaat pariman kaa hota he tathaa doosraa maapan us maapak yantra se kiya jaataa he jise anshashodhit karnaa hota he
 The instrument with known precision is called standard
 yadi tharmametre kii nalee kaa bhitari vyas sarvatra samaan na ho to baraabar duuri par digari kaa chihn lagane se trutiyaan utpann hongi
 As a result, for a true measurement of heat it is necessary to know how much error is there on each sign
 isi prakaar prayek maapak yantra ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak ho jaataa he ki prayek chihn par kitni truti he
 This is called calibration
 yantra chaahe kitni bhi saavdhaanee se kyon na banaae jaaen, banane par sookshm jaanch se avashya hi kahin na kahin kuch truti pai jaati he
 Then, to save time, instrument makers often do not even try to bring absolute purity
 isliye sookshm naapon main anshshodhan mahatvapurn hota he
 The International Science Association has given definitions of fundamental and major quantities and has also fixed their units
 inke maapne ke liye pramanik upkaran banaae gaye hai
 If a new measuring instrument is made, its calibration is done by comparing the parts of the same authentic instruments

 When making a new thermometer, the location of these two points is first marked in the tube by filling the mercury in the tube knob
 phir inke bich sthaan ko 100 baraabar bhaagon main baant diya jaataa he
 When determining the temperature of an object, suppose the surface of the mercury reached 40 degrees; So 40 degrees will be pure text only if the section of the tube is uniform everywhere and the marks of 0 degree to 100 degree are placed exactly at a distance
 kintu nalee kaa prasthachhed adarsh rup main sarvatra samaan nahin hota or anshankan main bhi trutiyaan ho sakati hai
 It is for these reasons that calibration is required
 iske liye nae tapamapak ke paathon kii tulana ek pramanik tapamapak se kii jaati he jo usee ke saath samaan paristhiti main rakhaa rahata he
 Equivalence of epiglottis can be checked by placing a column of mercury about an inch long in the tube and moving it in various places

 Wicked laughter or crazy laughter is a full of hysterical laughter that is commonly laughed at by a villain

 In comic books where the Mahakhalnayak displays such laughter, it is sometimes printed as Mwahaha, Mwhahaha, Muahahaha, Hehehehe, Bvuhuhuha, etc
 These words are common on the Internet
 ise chitthakaari, bulatin board pranali, or online khelon main prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 These words are simply there when some kind of victory is recorded, or to show that someone has a sense of superiority over someone else
 in shabdon ko vismayaadibodak ke rup main adhikansh rup se prayog kiya jaataa he or kam hi sangya ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 In 1930, the popular radio program The Shadow repeatedly used wicked laughter as an indication of his performance
 isaki awaz abhinayta frank redic ne di thi, or uski awaz us samay bhi jari rahi jab is kaarykram mukhya abhinay orsan veles ne kiya tha
 Vincent Price's wickedly laughable version has been used many times on radio, film, music and TV
 unamem se sangeet video maaikel jaikasnaz thrillar bhi ek he
 The wicked laughter in the films mostly completes the sound track when the villain is away from the camera

 An example of this is the Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Bellock's laughter lurks in the wilderness of South America when Indiana attempts to escape Jonz Howitzos

 Non-human characters such as Raja Ghidorah and Destorah from the Gazila series also used to have laughably laughable laughter or make laughter-like sounds
 manu sharma dwaara rachit lakshagrih: krishna kii atmakatha main bhi is hansee kaa dharmik paridrishy main varna is prakaar se he: Measurement of heat in some way is called calorimetry or 'calorimetry'

 vibhinn tapon par ek digari taap badhaane ke liye aavashyak ushma kii maatra main antar bahut kam haata he; at: saadhaaran prayogon main kisi bhi taap par 1 gram shuddh jal ke taap main 1° sein
 kii vruddhi ke liye aavashyak ushma kii maatra ko 1 calories maan sakate hai
 Thermodynamics - The heat of an object is that of heat which is 1 cm
 For heating, that item has to be given, or 1 cent
 It is obtained by heating
 jal kii ushmadharita kii tulana main kisi padaarth kii ushmadharita ko us padaarth kii vishisht ushma kehete hai
 That is, the amount of heat required for any temperature increase of a mass of matter and the heat dissipation required for the same temperature rise of water of the same mass is called the specific heat of that substance
 1 gram jal kii 1° sein
 tapavriddhi ke liye aavashyak ushma 1 ekak ushma hoti he at: ek gram padaarth kii ushmadharita us padaarth kii vishisht ushma hoti he
 If the amount of heat required to raise an object of mass m to temperature is m, then the specific heat according to the aforesaid definition will be found in the following formula: kisi vastu ke dravyaman tathaa vishisht ushma ke gunanfal ko us vastu kii ushmadharita kehete hai
 It is also called the 'water balance' of that object
 saadharantaya vishisht ushma kii paribhaasha karte samay us paristhitiyon kaa nirdesan aavashyak he jinamein taapaparivartan hua ho
 For example, if compression increases the temperature of a gas, the value of dt will not be zero but dq = 0
 atev vishisht ushma vi shunya hogi
 On the other hand if a gas is given a finite amount of heat and its diffusion is such that its temperature is constant, then in this situation dt = 0 and dq will not be zero
 atev vishisht ushma bahut adhik hogi
 The diffusion of gas can also be done in such a way that some amount of heat is given to it but still its temperature declines; In this case, due to dt being negative, the value of its specific heat will also be a minus
 isse yah prathit hota he ki gas kii vishisht ushma kaa maan + ananat se - ananat ke bich kuch bhi ho saktaa he tathaa yah maan paristhitiyon se sambandhit he
 For this reason, it is very important to direct the conditions of temperature conversion with respect to the specific heat of the gas
 at: gas ke vishay main do vishisht ushmayen hoti hai : The volume changes in ordinary experiments are low and negligible due to less compression in liquids and solids
 at: ek hi vishisht ushma rah jaati he
 At each temperature, solid and liquid have a certain specific heat and increase with temperature
 isamen jal kaa taapan ek niyat taap tak kiya jaataa he tathaa is jal kii maatra se ushma kii maatra gyaat kii jaati he
 This method has the following practices: mishran vidhi, Cooling method, is vidhi dwaara rena ne param shuddh fal gyaat kiye
 If the mass of two substances a and b are m1 and m2 heat T1) and T2 and specific heat S1 and S2 and if they are placed with each other, the heat will go from one to the other and consequently their temperature will eventually be between T1 and T2
 a normal temperature will be t parinamat: yadi ushma kaa niyaman k tathaa kha hi main ho to k dwaara di gai ushma kha dwaara lee gai ushma ke tulya hogi- Here we have assumed that a and b neither take heat from other objects nor give them to them during the period of the equation of heat
 vyavhaar main yah avasthaa asambhav he
 Generally, heat is also exchanged with other things
 aisi trutiyon ko dur karne athwa kam karne kii vishesh reetiyaan hai
 The main tool for calorimetry experiments is a thermometer made of copper, brass or a thin sheet of silver
 yah ek bade bartan ke bheetar kuchaalak aadhaaron par rakhaa jaataa he
 The thermometer is filled with water of measured mass, in which a heated object of certain temperature is added and the temperature conversion is read from a microscopic thermometer
 jal ko chalaane ke liye usamen taanbe kaa muda hua vichaalak rahata he
 To remove or reduce heat loss by radiation, polishing is done on the outer floor of the thermometer and the inner floor of a large vessel
 kisi tapt padaarth ko ushmamapi ke jal main daalane par jal ke atirikt ushmamapi, vichaalak tathaa tapamapi kaa paara bhi tapt padaarth kii ushma lete hai tathaa unke taap main bhi vruddhi hoti he
 Therefore, it is also necessary to take account of their heaters
 tapantar kii vruddhi se vikiran shodhan main bhi vruddhi hoti he; is kaaran uchit yah he ki ushmamapi main jal kii maatra itani adhik lee jaae ki taap main adhik vruddhi na ho; parantu aisa karne se prayog kii sookshmata ghat jaati he
 To counteract this, the behavior of a microscopic thermometer becomes necessary
 yah vidhi is kalpana par nirdhaarit he ki jab koi vastu kisi samaavrutt main sheethal hoti he to samay kii us avadhi main uske dwaara utsarjit ushma dq vastu ke samaavrutt par, taap ke aadhiky par, uske tal kii prakruti par, tathaa tal ke kshetrafal par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore is sameekaran main vastu ke tal par, arthath uske kshetrafal tathaa vikiran shakti par nirbhar he, tathaa f taap ke aadhiky kaa agyaat falan he jo prayek vastu ke liye samaan hoga
 Therefore, if Newton's coagulation law is the case, then this function is only the temperature dt
 yadi dt avadhi main vastu tapantaral dt se sheethal hoti he to m is the code of the object and s is the specific heat
 at: If the area of the floor of both the objects is same then a = a 'then the following relation can be derived- arthath donon vastuon kii ushmadharitaayen un avadhiyon kii nishpatti hai jo un vastuon ko taap ke samaan paraas dwaara sheethal hone main lagati hai
 In this way perfect fruits are not available
 iskaa keval aitihaasik mahatv hi rah gaya he
 Black used this method for the first time
 him ke ek bade tukade main chota sa chhed banaakar usame mukh ko him ke chote tukade se band kiya jaataa he
 Thus a mandala surrounded by snow is formed
 gyaat dravyaman kii vastu ko ek nishchit taap tapt kar tathaa himmandal ke jal ko saavdhaanee se sokhkar tapt vastu ko uske bheetar turant daal diya jaataa he or uske mukh ko laghu him khand se dhak diya jaataa he
 This object gives heat immediately to the ejection of the snow and this causes a certain amount of snow to liquefy
 purv taule hue ek spanj se is jal ko sokhkar spanj ko pun: taul lete hai tathaa dravit him kaa dravyaman gyaat kar lete hai
 If the initial temperature of the object is T, and mass m and specific heat S, then the amount of heat given by it will be m ST
 parinamat: Here l is the latent heat of snowflake and w is the mass of liquid snow
 himadravan se aaytan kaa hraas hota he
 Based on this theory, Bunsen's snow thermometer is a highly sensitive tool to determine the specific heat of liquids and solids
 yadi padaarth kam maatra main uplabdh ho tab bhi uski vishisht ushma gyaat kii ja sakati he
 Pure ice fills around the entire device
 nalee k main kuch shuddh jal rakhte hai
 When the entire device is heated to 0 ° C, the given solids are given a constant heat After heating, immediately pour the tube into the water

 Suppose it is
 at: dravit him kaa dravyaman gram
 If there is a secret heat of the secretion of snow is upkaran ko upyog main laane ke liye bahut saavdhaanee kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is very important that the mercury and water in it be pure and airless
 baahar ke him kaa bhi shuddh hona aavashyak he
 In this method, placing the substance in a circle on the pan of Libra, it keeps filling with water temperature of 100 ° till the weight of the pan becomes stable
 donon taulon ke antar se sanghanit vaashp kii maatra gyaat ho jaati he
 If the mass of the substance is heat and specific heat, and the mass of condensed vapor and latent heat of water vapor are l iske liye jolly ke jalawaashp ushmamapi kaa upyog hota he
 The stable volume of the gas is determined by the specific heat value of the Jolly's various hydrometer
 yah jalawaashp ushmamapi se kuch bhinn hota he
 a sphere filled with pure and dry gas is hung from the arm of the Libra by a fine metal wire, and another ball corresponding to it from the other arm, which is vacuumed
 ye donon gole ek hi mandal main rahete hai
 Now the specific heat of the gas is determined by the method described earlier
 sthir chaap vishisht ushma kaa maan gyaat karne ke liye reno ke upkaran kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Lausana has conducted important experiments on this subject
 rasayan vigyaan main, kisi rasinic abhikriya ko sampann hone ke liye jo nunatam urja aavashyak hoti he use sakriyan urja kehete hai
 The term was first used in 1889 by Sweden scientist Arhinius
 sakriyan urja ko praayah Ea se nirupit kiya jaataa he
 Its unit is kilojoules per mole or kilocalories per mole
