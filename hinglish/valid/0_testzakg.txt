 Realism or political realism has been the dominant theory of international relations since the inception of the teaching of international relations
 yah siddhant un pracheen paramparaagat drushtikonon par bharosa karne kaa daawa karata he, jisamen thuseedide, maikiyaveli or hobs jaise lekhak shaamil hai
 Early realism can be expressed as a reaction against idealistic thinking
 yathartwaadiyon ne dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke prakope ko adarshavaadi soch kii kami ke ek saboot ke rup main dekha tha
 There are various varieties in modern realist thought, however, as the main principles of this theory state control, existence and self-help are considered
 yatharthwaad main kai mahatvapurn manyataayen hai
 Realists believe that nation-states are unitary and geographically based actors in this chaotic international system, where no real official world exists as a government capable of regulating interactions or interactions between these nation-states
 duusare, yah antarsarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya sanghathanon, gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, yaa bahurashtriya companiyon ke bajaay samprabhu rajyon ko hi antarrashtriya maamalon main praathmik abhinayta maanate hai
 Thus, the state itself, as the supreme system, remains in competition with each other
 aise main, ek rajya apane astitv ko banaae rakhane, apni khud kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye or in praathmik uddeshyon ke saath apane swayan ke swaarth kii khoj main ek tarksangat swytt abhinayta ke rup main kaary karata he or is tarah apni samprabhutaa or astitv kii raksha karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Realists believe that nation states, in pursuit of their own interests, attempt to mobilize resources for themselves and determine the relations between states by their respective levels of power
 shakti kaa yah str rajya ke sainya, aarthik or raajnneetik kshamtaaon se nirdhaarit hota he
 Human nature realists believe that states are inherently aggressive, so territorial expansion has been bounded by opposing powers
 jabaki dusre aakraamak / rakshaatmak yathartwaadeeyon kaa maananaa he ki rajya hamensha apane astitv kii suraksha or nirantarata kii chintaa se grast rahete hai
 The defensive approach leads to a security dilemma, because while a nation becomes a weapon to enhance its own security, the opponent also tries to gain parallel benefits as well
 isliye yah prakriya or adhik asthirataa kii ore le ja sakati he yahan suraksha ko keval shunya raashi khel / shunya-sanchay khel ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan keval saapeksh laabh mil saktaa he

 He was appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland respectively
 henry ko shreshth shikshakon dwaara ucch-shrenee kii shiksha pradaan kii gai, tathaa ve latin, french va spanish bhashaaon main paarangat ho gaye
 Since it was expected that the crown would be given to Prince Arthur, Henry's elder brother, Henry was prepared to live in the church
 jab henry 11 varsh ke the, tab unki maa elizabeth of york kaa nidhan ho gaya
 In 1502, at the age of 15, Arthur died of Eragon only 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine
 arthur kii mrityu ke kaaran unke saare kartavya ab unke chote bhai, das-varshiya henry, par aa pade, jo ki ab prince of wales bane
 Henry VII recycled his efforts to ensure a matrimonial alliance between England and Spain, marrying his second son, Catherine, widow of Prince Arthur, the surviving children of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella i of Castile
 i was the youngest, proposed to do
 prince of wales dwaara apane bhai kii vidhwaa se vivaah karne ke liye, saamanytah pope se anumati praapt karnaa aavashyak tha, taaki is vaivaahik-sambandh kii baadhaon ko khaarij kiya ja sake kyonki book of laviticas main bataaya gaya he ki "yadi koi bhai apane bhai kii patni se vivaah karata he, to ve santanheen bane rahenge
" catherine ne shapath lee ki prince arthur ke saath vivaah ke baad unke bich shaareerik sambandh sthapit nahin hue the
 Nevertheless, both the English and Spanish sides agreed to obtain an additional permission from the Pope for this marriage, so that all doubts related to the validity of this marriage could be overcome
 catherine kii maa, rani isabela pratham kii adheeratha ke kaaran, pope julius dwitiya pope ke ek ajna-patr ke rup main anumati dene par raji ho gaye
 So 14 months after the death of her young husband, Catherine became the fiancée of her husband's younger brother, Henry
 lekin, san 1505 tak, ek spani gathbandhan banane main henry saptam kii ruchi samaapt ho gai or yuva henry ne ghoshnaa kar di ki unki sagaai unki sahmati ke bina yojit kii gai thi
 The continuing diplomatic stance over the future of the proposed marriage remained until Henry's death in 1509
 keval 17 varsh ke henry ne 11 june 1509 ko catherine se vivaah kiya or 24 june 1509 ko westominster aibe main un donon kaa rajbhishek hua
 Two days after his coronation, he arrested his father's two unpopular ministers, Sir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley
 un par gambhir-rajdroh kaa aarope lagaaya gaya or san 1510 main unhen faansee de di gai
 This became Henry's way of dealing with those on his way

 Upon meeting Francis i near Kalais on 7 June 1520, he entertained the French king for fifteen days with lavish entertainment to establish a close diplomatic relationship after military confrontations over the last decade
 san 1511 main, pope julius dwitiya ne france ke viruddh ek pavitra lig kii ghoshnaa kii, yah nayaa gathbandhan tezi se viksit hua or isamen na keval spain or pavitra roman samrajya, balki england bhi shaamil ho gaya

 On 18 February 1516, Queen Catherine gave Henry his first child, Princess Mary, to complete infancy
 aarthik rup se, henry kaa shashan lagbhag ek duswapn tha
 Although he enjoyed a prosperous economy in succession, Henry's heavy spending and excessive taxes damaged the economy
 udhaaharan ke liye, henry ne royal navy kaa vistaar 5 se 53 jahaajon tak kar diya
 He loved palaces; He started with a dozen palaces and at the time of his death had reached a figure of fifty-five, in which he hung 2,000 tapestries
 tulanaatmak rup se, unke padosi or bhattije, scotland ke james pancham ke paas paanch mahal tathaa 200 chitrayavanikaayen thim
 He was proud to display his weapons, which included attractive archery equipment, 2,250 land ordinances and 6,500 pistols

 From 1514 to 1529, Thomas Wolsey, a Catholic cardinal, served as Lord Chancellor and practically controlled domestic and foreign policy for the young king
 unhone france ke saath yuddh-viraam kii sandhi main vaarta kii, jiskaa sanket field of cloth of god main mitrataa ke naatakeey pradarshan se mila
 He followed England back and forth as an ally of France and the Holy Roman Empire
 wolsi ne rashtriya sarkaar ko kendrikrut kar diya or parishadi adaalaton, vishisht rup se star chember, ke adhikaar-kshetra kaa vistaar kiya
 His use of forced debt to pay for foreign wars enraged wealthy people, who were also angry because of his excessive wealth and boisterous lifestyle
 jab rani catherine se ek sheeghra talaak ko bachaa paane main wolsi vifal rahe, to isse raja ko niraashaa hui
 The treasury was emptied after years of extravagance; Feudal and subjects were dissatisfied and Henry needed to adopt a completely new approach; Wolsey had to be replaced
 16 varshon tak sheersh par rahane ke baad unhone satta ganvaa di or san 1530 main unhen rajdroh ke jhuthe aaropon main giraftaar kar liya gaya or hiraasat main hi unki mrityu ho gai
 Wolsey's fall was a warning to the Pope and the clergy of England as to what could be the result of the king's failure to fulfill his wishes
 iske baad henry ne apni sarkaar kaa puraa niyantran apane haathon main le liya, haalanki darbar main anek jatil gut ek duusare ko nasht va samaapt karne ke prayaason main lage rahe
 Elton argues that there was a major Tudor revolution in government
 henry ko budhimaani or chaalaaki kaa shrey dete hue, alton kehete hai ki unke adhikansh sakaaratmak krity, visheshtah rome ke saath sambandhon kii samaapti, thomas cromwel kaa kaary tha, raja kaa nahin
 Elton considers Henry a capable, but extremely lazy, subject to direct control of affairs for any extended period; That is, the king was an opportunist who depended on other people for doing most of his ideas and doing most of the work
 henry ke vaivaahik saahas alton ke pramaanon kii shrinkhalaa ke bhaag hai; alton ullekh karte hai ki ek purush, jo chah patniyon se vivaah karata he, aisa vyakti nahin he, jiskaa apane swayan ke bhagya par puraa niyantran ho
 Elton demonstrates that Thomas Cromwell envisioned a Commonwealth of England, which included popular participation through Parliament, and that this was generally expressed in the Preamble to the Law
 sansadeey sahmati kaa arth yah nahin tha ki raja ne apana koi bhi adhikaar chhod diya tha; henry ashtum ek pitrusulabh shaasha the, jo apni shakti kaa prayog karne se jhijakte nahin the
 The popular "consent" was a means of increasing it rather than limiting imperial power

 Henry directly prayed to the Holy See without telling Cardinal Thomas Woolsey, from whom he had kept his plans for Ann secret
 iske bajaay, vivaah ke nirastikaran kaa nivedan karne ke liye henry ke sachiv, wiliam nite, ko pope clement saptam ke paas bheja gaya
