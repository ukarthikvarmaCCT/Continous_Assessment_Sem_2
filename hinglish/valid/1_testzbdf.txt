iske kaaran hai kalilkanon ke aakaar or prakaash ke tarangadairghy main samanta tathaa vitarit padaarth ke vartanaank or prakaash ke tarangadairghy main samanta tathaa viparit padaarth ke vartanaank kaa avichhinn madhyam ke vartanaank se adhik hona
 With the help of powerful microscopes, the talcus can be seen by the effect of the Tyndall
 is prakaar dekhe jane par kalilkan prakashit taron kii bhanti dikhaai padate hai
 Also their speed is quick, irregular and continuous
 is gati ko hi brounian gati kehete hai
 At the same speed, the ideas of the theory of dynamics of substances have been experimentally confirmed
 aavogadro niyatank ko is siddhant ke anusaar nikaalane par yah siddh ho gaya he ki praayogic truti kaa vichaar karke is vidhi se nikaale gaye aavogadro-niyatank ke maan anya vidhiyon ke nikaale gaye is niyatank ke maan se samya rakhte hai
 Perrin has taken the value of Avogadro constant 6

 For many technical methods, it is necessary to create a color
 jalasantrasi kalil hi saralata se banaae ja sakate hai, kyonki jalpremi kalil utkramntic hai
 There are several methods used to construct the drainage systems
 in vidhiyon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he– ekikaran or vighatan
 In the first method, molecularly sized particles are gradually elongated until they attain the size of the buds, and their acceleration is accelerated by the presence of a stabilizing material, or by the addition of a water-soluble particle, Is controlled
 is vidhi se kai dhaatuen, hydraxiden, aviley lavan tathaa photography main kaam aanevaali rajat helliden kalilavastha main nirmit kii gai hai
 In the second method, larger particles are divided into smaller particles
 bradig vidhi main dhaatuon ke bade tukdon ko vidyut arq kii sahaayta se todakar dhatviya kalil praapt kiye jate hai
 For this reason this method is called the method of dissolution, but in reality these buds are also made by the method of integration
 arq ke ucch taap par dhaatu vashpikrut ho jaati he
 Then the superfluous particles of vapor get integrated and form the shape of the particles
 vastav main vibhaajan dwaara kalil banane kaa pramukh saadhan kalil-mil he
 In this device, two plates, which are very close to each other, rotate in opposite directions
 vitarit kiya janevaala padaarth uchit madhyam ke saath in donon platon ke bich se bheja jaataa he
 In this way, the particles become smaller and take the shape of darker particles
 donon main se kisi bhi vidhi se nirmit kalilon ke shodhan ke liye unhen manibhabh padaarth se apohan dwaara pruthak kriya jaataa he
 To do this Kalil is placed in a parchment or cellophane bag
 is jhole ko ab shuddh vilaayak main rakh diya jaataa he
 This solvent is the only medium of the bud
 vaidyut apohan se shodhan adhik purna or shghri sampann kiya ja saktaa he
 Water-loving urns are extremely permanent and inert to small quantities of electrodynamics
 inkaa sthayitv unki madhyam main vileyata ke kaaran hota he
 The outer surface of these calculus is covered with molecules of medium
 is prakaar bahyatal kii mukt urja naganya rahati he
 This makes these particles unable to grow in size
 iske atirikt yah dekha gaya he ki jalpremi kalil madhyam kaa antartaleey tanaav kam kar dete hai
 Stability of the buds is also controlled by this effect
 jalasantrasi kalilon kaa sthayitv kalilkanon par sthit aavesh ke kaaran hota he
 The charge on the outer plane of the calculus is created by the ions absorbed by them
 kisi vidyudvishleshya ke milaane par kalilkanon ke tal par aavesh ksheen ho jaataa he or dhire-dhire aisi sthiti aa jaati he jab vidyudvishleshya kii nimnatam sandratha par kalilkanon kaa tal ekikaran kii shaktiyon kaa virodh kar paane main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Thus the lowest concentration of electrodynamics, which is capable of depositing a certain amount of a particle, is called the precipitation value of the particle
 saadhaarant: vidyudvishleshya ke us aayan kii sanyojaktaa, jo kalilkaran ke aavesh ke vipareet ho, jitani hi adhik hoti he, vidyudvishleshya kii avakshepan shakti bhi utani hi adhik prabal hoti he
 Hydrographic tubes are added to them to keep them safe from hydrodynamics
 is vidhi ko sangrakshan vidhi kehete hai
 Swarnakalil can be degraded with a small amount of gelatin, but a high amount of this protein gives stability to this bud
 jigmondi ke anusaar kisi kalil sangrakshak kaa swarnmaan kalil sangrakshak ke milligraamon kii vah sankhya he jisaki upasthiti main swarna ke 10 ghan centimetre pramanik kalil ko sodium chloride ke aise 1ghan sein
me
 vilyan dwaara, jiskaa sandran 10 pratishat ho, avakshipt kiya ja sake
 The conservation of Kalil is of special importance and has been practiced since ancient times
 yah pehle hi kaha ja chukaa he ki kalil kanon par aavesh rahata he
 Simple absorption experiments can be done to find the type of charge on the cell
 dhanatmak kalil silica jelly dwaara or rinatmak kalil aluminium hydraksaide dwaara avashoshit kar liye jate hai
 Charge is important for the stability of the hydrologist Kalil
 aavesh kaa prakaar padaarth ke bhautik swabhaav par or kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karanevaale vidyudvishleshya par nirbhar rahata he
 For example, if the silver iodide sol is charged, the type of charge on it can be both positive or negative
 yadi kalil main rajat nitrate kaa sookshm aadhiky hua to saul dhanatmak hoga
 Conversely, if excess of potassium iodide occurs, the sol will become negative
 yah dekha gaya he ki dhanatmak rajat aayan ke abhimaanya adhishoshan ke kaaran rajat iodide kalil kaa aavesh dhanatmak or iodide ke rinatmak aayan ke adhishoshan ke kaaran is kalil kaa aavesh rinatmak ho jaataa he
 The amount and potential of charge on the ground floor are measured by money-electrocution
 saul ko you nalee main bharaa jaataa he jisamen do platinum ke vidyudagr rahete hai
 Now Daish Vidyuthara flows in Saul
 yadi kan dhanagar kii ore badhate hai to unpar rinatmak vidyut aavesh rahata he
 This type of motion of particles in the electric field is called money-power-transmission
 yah gati upyukt prakaashiya vidhiyon dwaara suvidhapurvak maapi ja sakati he
 The voltage can be calculated by measuring the velocity
 is vibhav ko saadhaarant: vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav kaha jaataa he
 This electromagnetic potential is also seen when the electromagnetic solution is sent through a collimated diluent
 do anya sambandhit kriyaaon par bhi anusandhan kiye gaye hai
 These are current potential and precipitation potential
 vaidyuthik gatyaatmak vibhav narnst vidyut rasinic vibhav se bhinn he
 It is now proved that the electrochemical chemical potential is the voltage that lies between the distributed art and the main volume of the delivery medium
 vaidyuthik-gatyaatmak vibhav vah vibhav he jo us vitarit kala se sanlagn dwik tal ke sthir bhaag main vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The real nature of the bicameral attached to distributed art is still a matter of imagination
 phir bhi yah gyaat kar liya gaya he ki vaidyut-gatyaatmak-vibhav upasthit yanon se vishesh prabhavit hota he
 There is ample evidence that the laws of gas fit well with the solutions
 kisi kalil kii rasakarshan daab kii gananaa neeche likhe sameekaran dwaara kii ja sakati he: Where: ab chunki rasakarshan daab kan ke aakaar kaa pratilomanupati hota he isse yah spasht ho jaataa he ki kalil kii rasakarshan daab kam honi chahie or vitaran kii maatra ke aadhiky ke saath inaki maatra bhi badhani chahie
 In this way, generally the impulse pressure of the rings is low and when the pressure is high, it is mainly due to impurities
 rasakarshan daab kaa maapan ardhapargamya jhilli kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa he
 The uneven distribution of electrosynthesis leads to complexity in some buds due to an action called dononsantulation
 is tanupat santulan kii kriya kaa adhyayan congou red naamak rang, sabun tathaa anya kai kalileey vidyudvishleshyon par kiya gaya he
 In these conditions the collicular substance behaves like an electrodynamic
 jab kisi aayan kaa aakaar kalilkanon ke aakaar ke samaan hota he jab tanupat ke donon ore vibhav kaa srijan hota he, jise tanupat vibhav kehete hai
 In many protein cells, dilution-potential always arises and charge on living cells is due to this equilibrium balance
 ati sookshmdarshi dwaara dekhne se kalilkanon kaa aakaar yaa rup nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Nevertheless the number of calculus can be counted; The average volume of a particle can then be determined by the value of the absolute volume of the distributed matter
 kintu jab saul nirmaan kiya jaataa he tab usamen kai aakaar ke kan upasthit rahete hai
 The form of the calculus can be spherical, lanceolate, elliptical or flaky
 kalilkanon kaa rup gyaat karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan viksit kii gai hai jo prakaashiya gunon par aadhaarit hai
 These plumes are characterized by having an impact on the viscosity of the delivery medium
 shyanta adhiktar bad jaati he or vitarit padaarth kii maatra kii vruddhi ke saath shghrita se badhati jaati he
 Viscosity increases so much when a particular concentration is reached that Kalil takes the form of jelly
 saul ke avakshepan se bhi jelly praapt kii ja sakati he
 The use of jelly is limited and the semipermeable gels that are made by cooling the gelatine, agar agar, starch, etc
 are called jelly
 adhikansh jalpremi kalil sheetaleekaran par yaa garm karne par jelly banaate hai
 Many inorganic hydrological plants can also be obtained as jelly under special conditions
 is prakaar se kai jaleey hydraxidon, aviley faspheton, molibdeton kii jeliyaan prayogshaala main banaai jaati hai
 The jelly generally exhibits the properties of liquid release
 adhik samay tak rakhane par jelly sikudti tathaa chatak jaati he or jelly main bandhaa hua jal baahar nikal aata he
 Jails can be divided into two classes: elastic and rigid
 pratyasth jeliyaan saadhaarant: gelatin, aighar aadi prakritik kalilon se banati hai, kintu adhikansh acarbonic jeliyaan, jinamein silisik amla bhi rahata he, drudh vyavhaar dikhaati hai
 Some jails have a strange nature
 ve hilaane par, andolit karne par yaa karnathit tarangon ke prabhaav se pun: saul main parivartit ho jaati hai
 But if they are kept stable then they become jelly again
 yah kriya kai baar duharai ja sakati he
 This action is called tactile sense
 jalpremi kalilon main proteinon ke saulon par vishesh khojein hui hai
 The reason for this is their importance in physical chemistry
 proteinon ke jo saul prakritik avasthaa main paae jate hai ve saadhaarant: rinatmak aveshwale hote hai
 Most solutes achieve positive charge when made acidic
 is prakaar ek vishesh pi ech par protein ke saul par koi bhi aavesh nahin hoga
 This is called isocele point
 isi se protein kii pahchaan haati he
 The chemical properties are ancient amphoteric because it has more bona fides
 is gun ke kaaran protein bafar kaa kaam detaa he
 This quality has special significance in the life of animals
 proteinon main jalasantrasi kalilon ko sthayitv pradaan karne kaa samarthy rahata he or inaki swarnsankhya kii sahaayta se kai rogon ke nidaan main sahaayta milti he
 It is not possible to calculate all the uses of the plants
 adhikansh jaivik taral padaarth, jaise rakt aadi, swabhaav ke hote hai
 As calcium-soap, metals such as calcium, gold, iron, gold, manganese, silver, etc
, or their insoluble compounds, are used in medicine in the form of kalil
 aahaar vigyaan main kalileey padaarthon par vichaar karnaa padataa he
 The humic and clayey soil properties have a special effect on soil fertility and its physical properties
 reshe carbonic kalil hai or kapadaa udyog bhi kalileey udyog hi he
 The color and printing used in the manufacture of chintz is done only because of the color properties
 kuch abhikaarakon main celulosiya padaarth ke kalileey gunon par kritrim resham kaa nirmaan aadhaarit he
 Soaps and detergents are the waste materials and many substances, such as lubricants, plastics, rubber, lubricants, oily dyes, etc
, are found to have scleenic properties
 kaanch, mrittika tathaa cement udyog kalileey vigyaan se vishesh rup se sambhddha hai
 Most of our diets, such as proteins, carbohydrate fats in the form of starch, etc
 are also lax in properties
 kalil rasayan kii takanic hamaare anek bhojya padaarth banane main aavashyak hoti he jaise pavaroti, makkhan, jelly, jam, peya, icecream aadi
 Jubra is a village in Pithoragarh district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Didihat tehsil
 kshupabhumi kisi aise bhushetra ko kaha jaataa he jahaan ke vanaspatiyon main kshupon pradhan ho
 Often, grasses, herbs and root plants also grow in such areas
 kshupabhumi prakritik hoti he yaa phir maanviya gatividhiyon ke kaaran bhi ban sakati he
 Sometimes due to fire in the forest, the trees are burnt and for a period of few years, the sap is spread here, after which gradually the trees grow, it again changes from the forest to become forest
 agar samay-samay par prakritik kaarnon se agni kaa prakope ho to aise sthaan sthaayee rup se bhi kshupabhumi bane rah sakate hai
 Somnath Mela is a historical fair of the culture and culture of the Himalayan region
 yah bharatvarsh ke uttrakhand pradesh ke kumaun kshetra ke antargat talla gevad naamak ghati main monsi va monsi ke sameep hota he
 This historic fair called Somnath is related to the ancient historical background of local residents of the surname named Kanouniyon or Kanouniyon Bisht and Monsiwal
 ise somnath, somnath mela, saldia somnath, aitihaasik somnath yaa kai sthaneey log sthaneey boli main bhidchyapu kautik bhi kehete hai
 It begins on the eve of the last Monday of Baishakh month and lasts for seven days
 is talla gevad ke maansi ke sameep parantu ab monsi main prativarsh hone vaale aitihaasik somnath meley kii aradhy bhoomi ko somnatheshwar mahadev kehete hai
 This historic Somnath fair was started from here
 jo aaj bhi tatsamay ke itihaas ke sunahare pannon or paali pachhaanuun ilaake kii kumaunni somskruthik viraasat ko uttrakhand kii samskruti ke saath samete he
 It was from here that the history of the fair started and it started with a pagoda called Somnatheshwar Mahadev, this Somnath
 vakt badla, log badale or meley kaa swaroop bhi achoota na rah sakaa or beesvin sadi ke ant tak mela monsi ke bazaar main hone lag gaya or itihaas bhi kaaphi kuch badal gaya or ikkisvin sadi ke purvardh main raajnneetik rang kaa samavesh bhi drushtagochar hone laga he
 It is worth mentioning that, hundreds of years ago, on the pagoda named Somanatheshwar Mahadev, Meldev was killed by conspiracies from the descendants of the fighters of the Katyuri dynasty
 tabase is meley kii shuruyaat hui he
 There is an ancient Naula here
 isi naule main yaa iske nikat unka katl kar diya tha
 Since then, all the people have been drinking and drinking clean and cold water of this gourd
 maatr kanonnion naamak upnaam se jane jane vaale chaar gonvon ke meldev kanonnion ke vanshaj is naule kaa pani aaj bhi grahan nahin karte
 This is true doosraa mela prarambh se pandraa din purv ukt chaaron gonvon ke kanonnion naamak upnaam ke nivaasiyon kaa masoor kii daal tathaa masoor mishrit vayanjanon kaa upyog varjit hota he, jaisaa ab tak prachlit he
 The history of this Somnath fair began with a pagoda called Somanatheswara Mahadev
 is sthal par tathaa iske uttar disha kii ore ramganga nadi ke donon taton par aachhadit rahata tha
 Time changed, people changed and the nature of the fair could not remain untouched and by the end of the twentieth century, the fair started in the market of Moncy and history has changed and is changing a lot
 ikkisvin sadi ke purvardh main raajnneetik rang kaa samavesh bhi drushtagochar hone laga he
 The 2014 ICC World Twenty20 was the fifth edition of the ICC World Twenty20, hosted by Bangladesh

 yah atyaadhunik takanic se bani 17 meter lambii or do meter chaudee agni-5 missile parmaanu hathiyaaron se las hokar 1 ton pelod le jane main sakasham he
 This missile, used in a range of up to 5000 km, has a three-stage propulsion system
 ise hyderabad kii pragat pranali prayogshaala ne taiyaar kiya he
 The biggest feature of this missile is MIRV technology i
e
 Multiple Independently Targetable Re -entry Vehicle) , With the help of this technology, this missile can be hit in multiple places simultaneously, one In many places shells can be fired, even the targets of different countries can be attacked simultaneously
 agni 5 missile kaa istemaal behad aasaan he
 It can be used anywhere by rail, road or air
 desh ke kisi bhi kone main ise tainaat kar sakate hai jabaki kisi bhi plateform se yuddh ke dauraan isaki madad lee ja sakati hai
 Not only this, canister technology has been used in the launch system of Agni V
 is kii vajah se is missile ko kahin bhi badi aasaani se transport kiya ja saktaa he, jisase ham apane dushman ke kareeb pahunch sakate hai
 The success of the Agni 5 missile will increase the strength of the Indian Army manifold as not only is its 5000 km range of firepower, but it is also capable of carrying nuclear weapons
 agni-5 bharat kii pehali antar mahadwipiya yani intercontinental balistic missile he
 After Agni-5, India has been counted among the 5 countries that have intercontinental ballistic missiles ie icbms
 bharat se pehle america, rus, france or china ne inter-continental balistic missile kii takat hasil kii he
ye kareeb 10 saal kaa faasla he jab bharat kii takat agni-1 missile se ab agni 5 missile tak pahunchi he
 The Agni-1 missile, which crossed the successful test line in 2002, was a medium range ballistic missile
 isaki maarak kshamta 700 kilometre thi or isse 1000 kilo tak ke parmaanu hathiyaar dhoe ja sakate the
 Then came Agni-2, Agni-3 and Agni-4 missiles
 All three are intermediate range ballistic missiles
 inaki maarak kshamta 2000 se 3500 kilometre he
 And now India's Defense Research and Development Organization i
e
 DRDO is going to test Agni-5 missile
 agni-5 paanch kaa chatha parikshan 3 june 2018 ko praatah 9 bajkar 48 minute par kiya gaya
 As far as the merits of India's first intercontinental ballistic missile Agni-5 are concerned
 to ye kareeb ek ton kaa pe-lod le jane main sakasham hoga
 The Agni-5 missile itself weighs about 50 tons
 agni-5 kii lambaai 17 meter or chaudaai 2 meter he
 Agni-5 is a 3-stage missile of solid fuel
 aaj jab odisha tat ke whealer island se bharat kii pehali inter continental balistic missile kaa pareekshan kiya jayega to diardio ke pramukh dow ve
 ke
 saraswat samet tamaam aalaa missile vaigyanik maujuud rahenge
agni-5 main RING LASER GYROSCOPE yani RLG takanic kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 The specialty of this technology made in India is that it targets very accurately
 agar sabakuch thik se hua to agni-5 ko 2014 se bhartiya sena main shaamil kar diya jayega
 Not only this, the Chinese missile Dongfeng 31A will get tough competition from Agni-5 because in the range of Agni-5 also comes the northernmost city of China, Harbin, which is the biggest reason for China's fear
 tipu sultan karnataka bharat ke tatkaaleen mysore rajya ke shaasha the
 Tipu Sultan was born on 20 November 1750 in Devanahalli km north of Karnataka)
 unka puraa naam sultan fateh ali khan shahab tha
 His father's name was Hyder Ali and mother's name was Faqrunnisa
 unke pita haidar ali mysore samrajya ke sainapati the jo apni takat se 1761 main mysore samrajya ke shaasha bane
 Tipu is known as the lion of Mysore
 yogya shaasha ke alaava tipu ek vidwaan, kushanhogay sainapati or kavi bhi the
 Tipu Sultan presented gifts to Hindu temples
 malkot ke mandir main sone or chaandi ke bartan he, jinke shilaalekh bataate hai ki ye tipu ne bhent kiye the
 Had presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikant temple of Kalale
 1782 or 1799 ke bich, tipu sultan ne apni jaagir ke mandiron ko 34 daan ke sanad jari kiye
 Many of these presented silver and gold plate gifts
 nanajangud ke shrikanteshwar mandir main tipu kaa diya hry ek ratna-jadit cap he
 Tipu presented a green Shivling to the Nanjundeshwar temple of Nanjangud
 shrirangpatna ke ranganath mandir ko tipu ne saat chaandi ke cap or ek rajat kapur-jvaalik pesh kiya
 Hyder Ali's demise and Tipu Sultan's reign in the late 18th century is a major event in Mysore
 With the arrival of Tipu Sultan, the British imperialist policy reached a tremendous foundation, on the one hand, the company government was expanding its nascent British Empire
 On the other hand, Tipu, on the other hand, was determined to protect Mysore on the strength of his valor and diplomacy
 Thus, in the late 18th century, Tipu was a great ruler who tried to expel the British from India
 apane pita haidar ali ke pashchaat 1782 main tipu sultan mysore kii gaddi par baitha
 Like his father, he was a highly skilled commander and a clever diplomat
 That is why he always wanted to avenge the defeat of his father from the British, the British were quite afraid of him
 tipu kii akruti main angrejon ko nepolian kii tasviir dikhaai padati thi
 He was a master of many languages, he started taking administrative service and warfare in his father's time, but his greatest demerit was that he was a stubborn and arrogant person
 yahi durgun uske paraajay kaa kaaran bana vah francisiyon par bahut adhik bharosa karata tha or deshi raajaaon ki shaktiyon ko tukshya samajhataa tha vah apane pita ke samaan hi nirankush or svantrtaachari tha lekin phir bhi praja ke takalifon kaa use kaaphi dhyaan rahata tha
 Thus, the peasants were happy during his reign, he was not a religion despite being a staunch Muslim
 He looked at Hindus, Muslims with a single eye, was also a great reformer and tried to improve the direct field of governance
 uske charitra ke sambandh main vidwaanon ne kaaphi matbhed he
 Criticizing him, various British scholars have described him as tyrannical and righteous
 itihaas kaa vilaksh ke anusaar haidar shaayad hi koi galati karata tha or tipu sultan shaayad hi koi kaam karata tha mysore main ek kahawat he ki haidar samrajya sthapit karne ke liye paidaa hua tha
 And Tipu is one of the few scholars who have praised Tipu's character for losing him
 vastut: tipu ek parishramee shaasha moulik sudhaarak or mahaan yoddha tha
 Despite all these things, he was not as diplomatic and visionary as his father, this was his greatest demerit
 isse bhi badi avagun uski paraajay agar uski vijay hoti to uske charitra kii prashansa kii jaati
 From the treaty of Mangalore, the drama of British Mysore war could not end, both sides did not consider this treat to be permanent, in 1786 AD Lord Cornwallis became the Governor General of India, he was not able to interfere in the internal affairs of the Indian states, but that Seeing the situation at the time, he had to intervene because at that time Tipu Sultan was his great enemy, so the British gave their Thiti Tipu this has the agreement with the regime to strengthen the person who wants to set up its head in both South hand for friendship Fransisio
 cornwalis jaanata tha ki tipu ke saath uskaa yuddh anivaary he
 And so he wanted to establish friendship with great powers
 usne nizaam or maraathon ke saath sandhi kar tipu ke khilaaf ek sanyukt morcha kaayam kiya or iske baad usne tipu ke khilaaf yuddh ki ghoshnaa kar di is tarah tritiy misur yuddh prarambh hua yah yuddh do varshon tak chalata rahaa prarambh main angrej asafal rahe lekin ant main isaki vijay hui
 In March 1792 AD, the war with Sri Rangapatya's treaty ended, Tipu gave half of his kingdom and 30 lakhs to the British to the Nizam, the largest part of it between the river Krishna Ta Pand
 kuch hissaa maraathon ko bhi praapt hua jisase uski raj kii seemaa tangabhadra tak chali ai shesh hisson par angrejon kaa adhikaar rahaa tipu sultan ne jaaytan ke rup main apane do pugon ko bhi cornwalis ko supurd kiya is paraajay se tipu sultan ko baari chhati uthaani padi unka rajya company rajya se ghir gaya tathaa samudr se unka sampark tut gaya
 Critics say that Cornwallis was in a hurry to make the treaty and by not having the full residence of Tipu that if he had crushed Tipu's power, there would not have been a fourth Mysore War in the future, but in fact Carnavalis had not done his visionary
 At that time, the English army was sick and there was a possibility of war between England and France in Europe
 The Marathas and the Nizams would have started burning with it if the British had merged the entire state with the British, so the Carnavalis' aim was that the power of Tipu would be exhausted and at the same time the company's friends could not become powerful
 He attempted to crush Tipu's power without making his friends powerful
 tipu sultan is apmaan janak sandhi se kaaphi dukhi the or apni badanaami ke kaaran vah angrejo ko parajeet kar dur karnaa chahta the prakriti ne unhen aisa mauka bhi diya lekin bhagya ne tipu kaa saath nahin diya is samay england or france main yuddh chal rahaa tha is intaraashtra paristhiti se laabh uthaane ke liye tipu ne vibhinn deshon main apana rajdut bheja francisiyon ko usne apane rajya main vibhinn tarah ki suvidhaayen pradaan ki apane sainik sanghathan ke unhone farsisi afasar nyukt kiye or unhone angrejon ke viruddh sahaayta ki april 1798 i
 main kuch francisi tipu ki sahaayta ke liye pahunchaa falat: angrej or tipu ke bich sangharsh aavashyak ho gaya
 At this time Lord Wellesley was appointed Governor General of Bengal
 unhonen tipu ki shakti ko kuchalane kaa nishchay kiya tipu ke viruddh usne nizaam or maraathon ke saath gathbandhan karne ki cheshtaa ki nizaam ko milaane main vah safal hue lekin maraathon ne koi spasht uttar nahin diya 1798 main nizaam ke saath velesli ne sahaayak sandhi ki or yah ghoshnaa kar di jite hue pradeshon main kuch hissaa maraathon ko bhi diya jaay purn taiyaari ke saath velesli ne mysore par akraman kar diya is tarah misur kaa chauthaa yuddh prarambh hua
 Tipu Sultan was a mighty warrior from the beginning
 aakhir tak yuddh karte karte mar gayi mysore par angrejo ki adhikaar ho gaya is prakaar 33 varsh purv misur main jis muslim shakti kaa udai hua tha sirf uskaa ant hi nahin hua balki angrej misur yuddh kaa naatak hi samaapt ho gaya
 Mysore, which had been the enemy of the progress of the British for 33 consecutive years, now came under the control of the British, the British and the Nizam got the partition of Mysore, the British got some part and the Nizam's right was accepted on some of the Marathas too
 Some states were given in the northwest but he refused to take the remaining Mysore state to a minor boy from the old Hindu dynasty of Mysore
 Ia was, according to the British with a treaty that the treaty came loads British security Mysore there admitted to the king spent the army was deployed British forces Mysore
 is niti se angrojon ko kaaphi laabh pahunchaa misur rajya bilkul chota pad gaya or kattar dushman kaa ant ho gaya company ki shakti main kaaphi vruddhi hui maraathon ko mila hua hissaa usne waapas kar diya falat: misur chaaron ore se british rajya se ghir gaya iskaa phayda unhonen bhavishya main uthaaya jisase british shakti ke vikaas main kaaphi sahaayta mili or ek din usne sampoorn hindustan par apana adhipaty kaayam kar liya
 On the basis of some incidents and documents it can be said that Tipu Sultan was a Dharmandh Muslim
 19veen sadi main btani sarkaar ke ek adhikari or lekhak wiliam logaan ne apni kitaab 'malabar minial' main likhaa he ki tipu sultan ne kis prakaar apane 30 hajaar sainikon ke dal ke saath kalikat main tabaahi machaai thi
 Tipu Sultan was riding on an elephant and his huge army was following him

 The legal system elaborates on a range of rights and responsibilities

 In the spiritual world, 'law of law' refers to 'law made by the Creator'

 sanyukt raashtra sangh ne 1945 se lekar aaj tak apane charter ke madhyam se yaa apane vibhinn anusaangik sanghathano ke madhyam se duniya ke rajyo ko va nagarikon ko yah bataane kaa prayaas kiya ki bina shanti ke samaaj kaa vikaas sambhav nahin he parantu shanti ke liye sashastitv evam nyaaypurna drushtikon hi nahin aacharan ko jinda karnaa bhi jaruri he
 Peace, harmony, friendship, coexistence can be established in a just society
 kanoon yaa vidhi kaa matlab he manushya ke vyavhaar ko niyantrit or sanchalit karne vaale niyamon, hidaayaton, paabandiyon or hakon kii samhita
 But this role also has moral, religious and other social codes
 darasal, kanoon in samhitaon se kai myanon main alag he
 The first thing is that the law is made by the government but in society it is applied equally to all
 duusare, ‘rajya kii ichha’ kaa rup le kar vah anya sabhi saamaajik niyamon or maanakon par praathamikta praapt kar letaa he
 Thirdly, law is compulsory ie citizens do not have freedom to choose to obey it
 paalan na karne vaale ke liye kanoon main dand kii vyavastha hoti he
 But, the law does not just punish
 vah vyaktiyon yaa pakshon ke bich anubandh karne, vivaah, uttaradhikaar, laabhon ke vitaran or sansthaaon ko sanchalit karne ke niyam bhi muhaiyaa karaata he
 The law also plays the confirmed role of established social morals
 chauthe, kanoon kii prakruti ‘saarvajanik’ hoti he kyonki prakashit or manyata praapt niyamon kii samhita ke rup main uski rachana aupchaarik vidhaayi prakriyaaon ke zariye kii jaati he

 raajnneetik vyavastha chaahe loktantric ho yaa adhinayakawadi, use kanoon kii kisi na kisi samhita ke aadhaar par chalanaa padataa he
 However, democratic systems have the right to repeal a law that has become irrelevant or not considered justified with changing times, and to demand a new better law in its place
 kanoon kii ek ullekhneey bhoomika samaaj ko sangathit style main chalaane ke liye nagarikon ko shikshit karne kii bhi maani jaati he
 In the beginning, the study of law was at the center of political science
 raajnneetik darshanik vidhi ke saar or sanrachana ke sawaal par jabardast bahason main uljhe rahe hai
 Law scholars also have to study anthropology, political economics, ethics and legislative value-systems

 In these systems no one works outside the purview of law, neither the person nor the government

 is prakaar jon lock kii bhashaa main kanoon kaa matlab he jivan, swatantraaa or sampatti kii raksha ke liye kanoon
 Liberalism theory makes it clear what should be the methods of making and enforcing the law
 udaahranarth, kanoon nirvaachit vidhikrttaaon dwaara aapasi vichaar-vimarsh ke dwaara kiya janaa chahie
 Secondly, no law can be enforced from the previous date, because in that case it will punish the citizens for the works which were done according to the then law
 isi tarah udaarataavaadi kanoon krur or amanviya kism kii sazaayen dene ke viruddh hota he
 An impartial judiciary, independent of political influences, is set up so that it can be decided by the parties on the basis of systematic interpretation of the law
 marxvaadiyon kii manyata he ki kanoon ke shashan kii avadharana vyaktigat swatantraaa kii guarantee karne ke naam par sampatti sambandhi adhikaron kii raksha karte hue poonjeewaadi vyavastha kii suraksha ke kaam aati he
 This results in social inequality and class dominance
 marks kanoon ko raajnneeti or vichaardhaara kii bhanti us superstracchar yaa adhirachana kaa hissaa maanate hai jiskaa base yaa aadhaar poonjeewaadi utpaadan kii vidhi par rakhaa jaataa he
 Feminists have also criticized the concept of the rule of law that it is not based on gender fairness
 isiilie nyaaypalika or kanoon ke peshey par purushon kaa kabza rahata he
 Advocates of multiculturalism argue that the law represents the values and attitudes of dominant cultural groups
 parinamswaroop alpsankhyak or hashiyagrast samoohon ke mulya or sarokaar nazarandaaz kiye jate rahete hai
 Philosophers have been beaming from the beginning on the question of the difference between law and morality
 kanoon kaa aadhaar naitik pranali main maanane waalon kaa vishwaas ‘prakritik kanoon’ ke siddhant main he
 Plato and after him Aristotle believed that there is a close relationship between law and morality
 ek nyaaypurna samaaj vahi ho saktaa he jisamen kanoon naitik niyamon par aadhaarit pragna kii pushti karte hon
 Medieval Christian thinker Thomas Aquina also believed that in order to live a good life on this earth, there should be laws according to natural law i
e
 God-given morals
 unnisvin sadi main buddhivaad or vaigyanik drushtikon kii pratishtha badhane ke kaaran prakritik kanoon kaa siddhant nishprabhavi hota chalaa gaya
 There were attempts to free the law from moral, religious and mystic beliefs
 jon austin ne ‘vidhik pratyakshthawaad’ kii sthapana kii jiskaa daawa tha ki kanoon kaa sarokaar kisi ucchtar naitik yaa dharmik usul se na ho kar kisi samprabhu vyakti yaa sanstha se hota he
 The law is therefore law that has to be obeyed and done

 heart kii rachana 'da concept of lau' main milti he
 Hart defines the law in the context of human society by removing it from the purview of moral rules
 unke mutabik kanoon pratham or dwitiyak niyamon kaa sanyog he
 Calling the first class rules as 'the essence of law', Hart says that they are related to the regulation of social behavior
 jaise, faujadaari kanoon
 Second-class rules instruct government institutions on how to make laws, how to implement them, how to make decisions on the basis of it and how to establish its legitimacy on these grounds
 heart dwaara pratipaadit vidhik pratyakshthawaad ke siddhant kii aalochana raajnneetik darshanik ronold dwarkin ne kii he
 According to him, the law is not merely a code of rules, nor do modern law systems provide a uniform way to establish the law's validity
 kanoon or naitikta ke bich sambandh kii bahes naziyon ke atyaacharon ko dandit karne vaale neuramberg mukademe main bhi uthi thi
 The question was whether those acts which were done in accordance with national law could be held a crime? To answer this, the concept of natural law was resorted to, but expressed in the language of human rights
 darasal kanoon or naitikta ke rishte kaa prashn behad jatil he or garbhpaat, veshyavriti, pornographi, tivi or filmon main dikhaai jane vaali hinsa, apni kokh kiraye par dene vaali maataaon or genetic ejineering jaise masalon ke sadanrbh main baar-baar uthati rahati he

 yah vah dharna he jise siddh karne ke liye, jo kuch hamen karnaa tha vah ho chukaa he or ab sthir mat apnaane kaa samay aa gaya he
 Religion, science, philosophy, policy, politics all expect theory
 dharm ke sambandh main ham samajhate hai ki buddhi, ab aage aa nahin sakati; shankaa kaa sthaan vishwaas ko lenaa chahie

 The answer to the third question is the research of facts and it varies

 What is the source of experience? According to empiricism, all knowledge is received from outside, according to rationalism it comes out from inside, according to criticism, knowledge is received from material, its shape is the gift of mind

 Moral controversy has a lot to do with enjoyment

 To reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies (or more), some countries have imposed limits on the number of embryos to be transferred, but these limits are not followed or accepted at all locations
 There is a spontaneous division of embryos in the uterus after transfer, but it is very rare and it gives birth to identical identical twins

 The military campaign launched on 13 April 1984 was unique as the first attack was launched in the world's highest battlefield
 sena kii karrwai ke parinamswaroop bhartiya sena ne puure siachin glacier par niyantran praapt kar kiya tha
 Today, the location of the Indian Army's deployment is known as the actual ground position line, sometimes incorrectly called Operation Meghdoot
 bhartiya sena or pakistani sena prayek ke das paidal sena batalian, 6,400 meter tak oonchai par sakriy rup se tainaat kiye jate hai
 The Siachen Glacier became a cause of controversy after the unclear boundaries outlined in the Karachi Agreement of July 1949 did not specify who had authority over the Siachen Glacier area
 bhartiya vyakhya yah thi ki pakistani kshetra shimla samjhauta par aadhaarit keval saltoro darre tak vistaarit he, jahaan kshetreey rekha ke maarg kii aakhri seemaa 'enje 9842' ke "glaciaron ke uttar tak" he
 Pakistan believed that their territory continued from 'north NJ 9842' to the Karakoram Pass in the northeast
 natijatan, donon deshon ne banjar bhoomi or siachin glacier par daawa kiya
 In the 1970s and 1980s, Pakistan allowed several mountaineering expeditions to climb the peaks of the Siachen region from the Pakistani end, perhaps an attempt to bolster their claims in the region
 jaisaa ki pakistan kii sarkaar se anumati praapt abhiyaanon main pakistan ke sena kaa ek sampark adhikari in tiimon ke saath rahata tha
 In 1978, the Indian Army also allowed mountaineering expeditions to reach the glacier that were climbing from India

 Through these glacier operations, both sides asserted their claims

 The Indian Army had planned to control the glacier on 13 April 1984, to keep the Pakistani army in abeyance for about 4 days, as the intelligence had planned to capture the glacier by 17 April

 In his memoirs, former Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf stated that Pakistan had lost about 900 square miles of territory

 Temporary camps were soon converted into permanent camps of both countries

 There are differing views on the strategic value of the operation
 kuch ise gaiyr-samrik bhoomi par ek nishpaksh kabje ke rup main dekhte hai jo bharat or pakistan ke bich virodhabhasi sambandhon kaa prakat karte hai
 Abundant people consider the operation as a "daring" success by the Indian military and ensure that the Indian Army occupied a strategically important part of the strategic Saltoro Pass west of the glacier
 bhartiya sena vartmaan main 70 kilometre lambey siachin glacier or iske sabhi upanadi glaciaron ke saath-saath glacier, sia laa, bilapond laa, or giyang laa ke pashchim main saltoro darre ke teen mukhya guton ko niyantrit karti he

 In 1987 and again in 1989, Pakistan attacked to capture the Indian controlled pass
 pehle hamale kaa netritv tab ke brigadier-general parvaiz musharraf ne karaayaa tha or shuru main kuch pahadiyon ko hasil karne main kaamyaab rahaa tha
 Later that same year Pakistan lost at least one major Pakistani post, "quaid", which became 'bana Post' under the control of the Indian Army, known as Bana Singh

 On the loss of the Siachen region and subsequent unsuccessful military operations, Benazir Bhutto told Muhammad zia-ul-haq that 'he should wear a burkha because he has lost his manhood'

 For other Kumaon articles, see Kumaon kumaun mandal bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke do pramukh mandalon main se ek hai
 Another division is Garhwal

 The existence of Kumaon also dates from the Vedic period

 There are many ancient temples and pilgrimage sites in this area too
 kumaanun kshetra main kai upbhashaain boli jaati hai
 Some of the main local languages are as follows: - kumaanun shabd kii vyutpati ke sambadh main vibhinn mat prachlit rahe hai
 From the point of view of language, it seems appropriate that this word is originally Kurma in Sanskrit
 champavat ke sameep 2196 meter unchaa kanteshwar parvat he jiske sambadh main manyata he ki bhagwaan vishnu apane dwitiya avatar main is parvat par teen varsh tak rahe
 Since then, he came to be known as kurm-anchal in place of Mount Kanteshwar
 is parvat kii akruti bhi kacchap kii peeth jaisi jaan padati he
 Probably this is the reason why this region may have been named as Kurmanchal
 pehle shaayad kurm shabd prayog main aata hoga, kyonki kurm shabd kaa prayog sthaneey bhashaa main bahutayat se miltaa he
 One of the reasons that the word Kumun may be replaced in place of Kurm can also be that the dialect here is found to be more uplifting
 kaalaantar main saahitiyik granthon, tamrapatron main kumuun ke sthaan par kumu or uske baad kumaun shabd sweekrut hua
 The use of the word Kurmanchal is also found in Sanskrit texts
 pramanik aitihaasik tathyon ke abhaav main nishchit rup se kahana kathin he ki multah kumaun kshetra main kin-kin maanav jatiyon kaa prabhutv tha
 It is known from certain references available in Mahabharata, Purana and ancient Sanskrit literature that the caste, Kirat, Kinnar, Yaksha, Tangava, Kulind, Khas etc
 were inhabited here
 mahabharat ke van parv main madhya himalay kii upatyakaon main nivas karne vaali jatiyon ko kiraat, tangav tathaa kulint bataaya gaya he
 Kirantatanganakarnakul Kulind Centa Sankalam
 yudhisthir ke rajasuya-yajna main upasthiton ke naam ginate hue duryodhana kahata he ki meru mandir parvaton ke madhya shailoksh nadi ke kinare nivas karne vaale khas-ekasana, paarad, kulind, tangav or parathangan naamak parvatiy raja kaale rang kaa chambar or pipilika jati kaa swarna laae the
 It has come to Dronaparva that the said mountainous castes took part in the battle of Mahabharata with stone weapons from Duryodhana and threw stones at Krishna's charioteer Satyaki, but they could not stand in front of Satyaki's slogans
 brahmpurana or vayupurana main madhya himalay main kiraat, kinnar, yaksha, gandharva, vidyadhar, naag, ityadi jatiyon ke astitv ke sanket uplabdh hote hai
 The Girimala described by the name of Kashy Parvat situated in Kosi in the Manas section of Skanda Purana has been considered as the hilly terrain of Almora - Kaushiki Shalmali Madhyay Punya: Kashyay Parvat

 The temple of Jakhan Devi in almora is a proof that in very ancient times there has been residence of the Dakshas

 Apart from the Yaksha caste, there are also signs of residence of the Naga caste in Kumaon in the Adi era
 pithauragarh jile ke berinag naamak sthaan main binaag / beninag kaa prasiddh mandir he
 There are many temples in Kumaon named after the serpents
 jaise dhulanag, kalinag, pinglanag, kharharinag, basuki naag, nagdev ityadi
 The existence of Yaksha and Naga castes in the primitive castes of Kumaon is based on conjectures, but in relation to the Kirat caste, some societies can be said on the basis of classical and anthropological evidence that in the prehistoric era, the land of kumaon-garhwal, Kirat, Mongol The Adi was the abode of the non-aryan castes, who were conquered by the non-vedic Aryans who came from the north-west side at a time
 yah bhi sambhaavna he ki is pradesh par aagney parivaar kii munda bhashaa-bhashi kiraat jati kaa prabhutv dirghakaal tak rahaa, anyathaa pracheen kaal main ise kiraatmandal kii sangya na milti
 With their independent linguistic existence, descendants of the rents still exist in places called Ascot and Didihat in Kumaon
 kumaun kii boliyon main aaj bhi anek aise shabd prachlit hai, jo pragaitihaasik kiraaton kii boli ke avshesh prathit hote hai, jaise- dhud, lidun, jung, jhungar, phang, thangar, ganga, lyat aadi shabdaawalee ke atirikt katipay-vyakaran tatv bhi aagney parivaar kii bhashaaon se samanta rakhte hai, jaise kumaunni karm kaarak suchak kani / can pratyay munda kii bhovesi tathaa cork baaliyon main ke / kin yaa khe / khin he
 The method of counting based on a group of twenty is found equally in Raji and Kumaoni
 bees ke samooh ke liye kumaunni main bisi shabd he
 Apart from the Kirat caste, the Bhotia caste living in Uttaranchal in the Himalayas was also dominated by the Kumaon region
 bhotiya shabd multah boat yaa bhot he
 Tibet is also called Bhot Desh or Bhutan and due to its belonging to that country, the residents there were called Bhotia
 bhotiyon kii bhashaa tibeti kahi gai
 It is closely related to Tibetan
 johaar daarma, bans tathaa chaudaans kii bhashaa main sthangat vibhed paae jate hai
 The influence of Kumaoni on the dialect of Bhotis is clearly reflected
