 jab anna apane mata pita ke saath praha jaati he to ek sangeet samaaroh main bhaag lene ke liye uske pita use or gabriel laa cler ko sirf do agents ke saath bhejne ke liye sahamat ho jate hai
 When Anna comes ready to go to the ceremony, her father turns away from his promise after seeing her sexy appearance
 jab anna ko pataa chalata he ki samaaroh main bahut saare agent maujuud he or uske pita ne apana vaada tod diya he to vah unase nazar bachaa kar nikal jane kaa nirnay karti he or is kaam main gabriel uskaa saath detii he
 Outside the ceremony, Anna meets Ben Calder and Anna instructs him to save her from the agents
 Anna goes to a bar to drink wine
 anna anjaan he ki ben swayan bhi guptachar sanstha kaa ek agent he or usne anya do agent alan veis or sinthia moralls ko anna kaa pataa bataa diya he
 The President orders the three agents that Ben be with Anna without telling him anything about himself so that he can have the illusion of freedom and also be safe
 kai saalon main pehali baar anna swayan ko angrakshakon se aaazaad mahasoos karti he or nagnavastha main vlatva nadi ko danubi samaj kar usame kud jaati he parantu vah nadi main doobane lag jaati he or ben ko use nadi main se nikaal kar laana padataa he 
 veis or moralls kisi se camera kharid kar dubli patali anna kii nadi main duubati hui tasviren khinch lete hai
 Anna and Ben climb a terrace to watch an opera being played in the plaza, Anna falls asleep while watching the opera and Ben protects her
 veis or moralls duusari chat se yah drishy dekh rahe hote hai
 The next morning, Anna calls her parents to avoid an uproar
 yah jaanate hue ki vah surakshit he, uske pita shuru main aaraam se baat karte hai or anna lautne kaa faisla karti he, lekin jab unhen anna kii nadi main nagn tasviren dikhaai jaati he to unka baat karne kaa lahaza badal jaataa he

 Ben also goes on the train with Anna, where they meet Scotty mcgruff
 scoti ek chanchal romani kism kaa aadmi he jis par chha million dollar vaale aadmi ke steekar chipkaane or duniya ke gol hone kii dhun savaar he
 He gives them a pile of these stickers and says that they should stick them in the places they want, then when someday they will be sad and see these stickers, they will be happy to see them and forget their grief
 Scotty tells them that they have boarded the wrong train, this train is going to Venice
 jab ve venice pahunch jate hai to ben anya agents ko apana pataa bataane ke liye phone karne jaataa he parantu jab use anna nahin dikhti to use phone latakta hua chhod kar bhaagna padataa he
 He sees that Anna and mcgruff are buying new clothes, the three of them roam in Venice, and then mcgruff steals their purses
 abhi ben cafe ke maalik ko yah bataa hi rahaa hota he ki ve bill nahin de paaenge ki anna ko kuch log pahchaan jate hai or unase bachane ke liye anna vahaan se bhaag khadi hoti he
 Ben chases Anna and they ride the gondola for free, telling the gondola owner, Kind Eugenio the false story that they have married against the will of Anna's parents
 cafe ke karmchaariyon se anna ko bachaane ke liye ben gondola kii sawari ke dauraan anna kaa chumban letaa he
 Knowing that he has no place to stay in Venice, Eugenio asks him to stay at his and his mother Maria's house
 us raat, yah soch kar ki ben usase pyaar karata he or isliye hi usne uskaa chumban liya tha, anna apana sab kuch ben ko saupana chaahati he
 To stop him, Ben behaves insidiously and rudely
 anna antat akele bistar main soti he or ben farsh par sota he
 The next day when Eugenio leaves them at the Austrian border, Weiss and Morales arrive at Maria's house, finding the gondola driver with whom Anna and Ben were last seen
 maaria unhen bataati he ki ben or anna vivaahit hai or yahi baat ve ja kar anna ke mata pita ko bataa dete hai
 Annoyed at Ben's neglect, Anna rides on a truck and Ben rides her on a bicycle and chases her to the villages of Austria
 anna kii mulaaqaat ek banji jamping karne vaale german samooh se hoti he jo ek pul se kudane kii taiyaari kar rahe hote hai
 mcgruff also comes for bungee jumping there
 anna ko banji jamping ke liye belt baandhi hi ja rahi thi ki ben vahaan pahunch jaataa he or uske saath kudane ke liye jor detaa he
 That night at a German camp, Anna and Ben sit in front of a fire and eat smores together and tie mcgruff on a tree upstream
 makgraff kahata he ki ek vah ek rahasyamay ladkee kii talash main saare europe main gum rahaa he or isliye hi use paison kii zarurat thi
 a German asks Anna to stay in her tent which Anna refuses, she again expresses her attraction to Ben to which Ben scolds her again, leaving Anna angry and saying this She now knows that she will stay in Jerman's tent
 Extremely jealous, Ben finally expresses his feelings towards Anna
 jab ben kaa marammat ho kar aayaa hua phone bajataa he to vah phone nahin uthaata or use ek taraf patake detaa he, vah raat ve saath saath bitaate hai
 The next day they arrive at the Love Parade and meet Gabrielle, Gabriel indicates that something has happened that Anna is very happy with Anna talking on the phone, pointing to Ben and saying that she is Ben She loves jab ben phone par apane kaary samajha rahaa hota he to anna uske peeche aakar khadi ho jaati he or yah jaan jaati he ki wo ek agent he or ab tak usne anna se sab kuch jhooth kaha tha
 Enraged and vowing never to forgive Ben in his heart, she walks away from him, where some people recognize him and surround him
 un logon se lard kar ben anna ko us jagah tak pahunchaata he jahaan par helicopter anna kii pratiksha kar rahaa hota he
 We then see Anna in Rashtrapati Bhavan, where she is preparing to go to college and her mother asks her how is her heart, then Anna replies, "it's a little broken"
 When she arrives at college with Weiss and Morales, she sees a six-million dollar sticker and smiles despite feeling depressed about her trip to Europe
 christmas kii chhuttiyon main jab vah apane pita se milane jaati he to vah use bataate hai ki ben ne istifa de diya he or ab vah landan main photographer kaa kaam karata he
 Now Anna goes on a tour to London Oxford College and also meets Ben at an opera where they kiss each other and all the Gilashikwe forget and reunite
 yahan bhi agent veis or uskaa nayaa ganja or nakli moonch pahanane vaala saathi anna ko dhund rahe hote hai
 Then, just like the beginning of the film, Anna asks Ben to get her out of there
 film main veis or moralls ko lekar bhi ek upakthanak he
 Weiss derisively satirizes Morales and even once asks him to get naked

 a radio receiver is an electrical circuit that presents the signals available in the form of electromagnetic waves after the antennas have finally processed them into sound or some other useful form
 radio tarangon ke utpaadan evam unke gunon ke adhyayan kaa prayaas sarvapratham hikerikh hertz ne san 1887 main kiya tha
 In his history famous experiment, the waves generated by the arrangement of the production of radio waves, he himself received in the form of sphincters between two knobs which were located at both ends of a string of wires
 harts ke is praarambhik prayog ne radio tarangon kii grahan vidhaon kii sambhaavna ke sanket die the, jinke aadhaar par kaary karte hue oliver loj ne san 1894 main england main ek vishesh prakaar ke sansuchak kaa nirmaan kiya, jo radio tarangon ko shravy aavriti kii tarangon main parivartit kar saktaa tha
 This detector was actually a glass tube filled with metal-rattan
 is sansuchak ko ek antena tathaa ek samaswarit paripath se sanyut kar pratham radio sangrahi kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 In this way, Oliver Lodge is responsible for envisaging the organizational component of the wireless communication system and presenting its first useful form
 loj ne apni is vishesh vyavastha dwaara pratham radio sangrahi kaa nirmaan safaltaapurvak kar use patent karaayaa
 Encouraged by the success of the lodge, many scientists created new detectors
 inamen goolyelmo marconi ne chumbakeey prakaar ke sansuchakon kii, vriland tathaa fesnden ne vidyut vishleshya prakaar ke tathaa lee di foresti ne sakriy vidyudvishleshya prakaar ke sansuchakon kii rachana kii
 Several crystal detectors were also made in this sequence, in which crystals of Carborundum, Galena, Iron Pyrites etc
 were used

 fleming ne dwidhruvi valbon kaa nirmaan kar, radio sanchaar pranali ke vikaas ke itihaas main nae adhyay kaa sutarapaat kiya
 The use of these valves as a detector solved many difficulties and problems
 isi ke lagbhag ek varsh ke hi ananthar lee di forest ne tryod valve kaa pranayan kar, electronic tathaa radio sanchaar pranali ke kshetra main kranti kaa aavirbhaav kar diya
 These valves and their many modified forms such as tetrod and pentode, etc
 can be credited with bringing the radio communication system to the modern form
 pravardhakon, sansuchakon evam samaswarit paripathon kii sanrachana karanevaale compitron kii rachana inhen vaalvon kii sahaayta se kii jaati he
 The part of the radio communication system that dissociates the desired fraction from the radio frequency energy that continuously transmits to the aerial is called the radio satellite
 sabhi prakaar ke radio sangraahiyon ko mulat: nimnlikhit kaary karne padate hai : a variety of radio signals continue to reach the antennas, which are transmitted from the transmission centers located in different parts of the world
 sangrahi main is baat kii upyukt vyavastha honi chahie ki vah kisi bhi kshan kisi vaanchit sanket vishesh kaa varan kar, use anya sanketon se pruthak kar, grahan kar sake
 For the accomplishment of this purpose, many motivations and capacitors are included in the selection system of the collector
 inamen se ekaadhik parivartaneey, yaa char bhi hote hai
 The combination of these inductors and capacitors creates a synchronized circuit
 is paripath main prerakatvon evam sandharitron ke maan is prakaar samanjit kiye jate hai ki paripath kii aavriti grahya sanket kii aavriti ke tulya ho jaae
 In that case, the circuit is called convergent for the said signal
 etdarth prerakatvon evam sandharitron ke maan nimnlikhit sutara ke anusaar niyat kiye jate hai : Where is the inductance of the inductor, capacitance of the capacitor and the acceptable signal frequency
 is prakaar samaswarit paripath keval usee aavriti ke sanketon kaa varan kar grahan karata he jo uski aavriti ke tulya hai shesh ko chhantakar vilag kar detaa he
 In good collection plants, several circuits are arranged in series order that significantly increases the variability, or selectivity, of the collector
 antena se praapt radio sanket atyant ksheen hote hai
 For this reason they are unable to execute the loudspeaker
 at: unki shakti ko paryaapt pravardhit kar sakane kii kshamta sangrahi main honi chahie
 The amplification system is then combined
 preshak kendron se sangrahi ke antena tak aanevaali sanketavahini tarangen atyant ucch aavriti kii hoti hai
 Therefore, after entering the collection, it is necessary to transform them into auditions
 in shravyavritiyon ko pruthak kar dhvanivistaarak main pravisht karne ke pashchaat hi sanket ko sun sakna sambhav hota he radio tarangon ko dhwani tarangon main parinat karne ke hetu prayukt tantra-vyavastha ko sansuchak yukti kehete hai The power of the audiovisual signals emitted from the detector is greatly impaired, leaving it unable to execute the loudspeaker
 at: laudspikar main pravisht hone ke purv isko paryaapt maatra main pravardhit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 The system used for this is called audiovisual amplifier
 shravyavriti sanketon ko vidyut se dhwani main roopantarit karne ke liye laudspikar yaa shiraphone bhi sangrahi set kaa ek mukhya bhaag hota he
 It is also called converged radio frequency receiver
 yah sangrahi kisi vishesh radio aavritiyon ke liye samaswarit rahata he
 All the circuits inside it are either synchronized to the desired radio frequency, or they are arranged in such a way that the frequency is synchronized all together
 puraane dhang ke aise sangrahi main aise prayek paripath ke saath ek pruthak samaswarak sandharitra hota tha, kintu aadhunik seton main ek hi parivartaneey, yaa char sandharitra se sabhi paripathon kaa is prakaar sanyukt kar diya jaataa he ki sandharitra ko ghumaane par uske bhinn bhinn dharitansh maano se bhinn bhinn paripath jud jate hai
 For a detailed article, see - Superheterodyne Collection pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan major edwin armastrang naamak vaigyanik ne saral sangrahi main apekshit sudhaar kar aisi sangrahi vyavastha ko janm diya jisamen kisi bhi aavriti ke sanket ko kisi samay sugamawa se grahan kiya ja saktaa he
 This system is in fact the father of modern popular radio-based sets
 swachaalit vaahan, jaise motor car, yaa vayuyan ityadi, main prayukt radio sangrahi ke seton kii rachana saadhaaran grihopayogi seton se thodaa sa bhinn hoti he
 These include the required voltages for power and heat taken from the vehicle's conductor battery and inserted into a vibrator, or rotational converter, to be augmented to the desired frequency
 is prakaar ke set kaa arial ek patali dhaatu nalika hoti he, jo car ke ek parshv par, vayuyan ke daine par sidhi khadi lagaai jaati he
 The latest models of this type of set are equipped with assemblers and volume control steer lashing, so that the collection can be handled conveniently
 radio sangrahi ko adhik upyogi, sasta tathaa suvahya banane ke hetu vaalvon ke sthaan par transistor kaa upyog kiya jane laga he
 This set is powered by a battery of only four and a half to six volts and its efficiency, that is, the ratio of power given to it and its available power, is six to ten times greater than that of a normal valve collector
 isse iskaa rakh rakhv vyay valve transistor se 4 yaa 5 guna kam hota he
 In addition, they are very small, portable and inexpensive
 sugrahi to ye itane adhik hote hai ki ek saamaanya pherite chad arial kii sahaayta se hi inhen kriyanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 With the introduction of integrated circuits, cheaper, smaller, less cell eaters and better service radio collectors have become available with the help of a single IC or a few chips

 Buddhism was born in India in the 6th century BC, but Buddhism from India was almost finished in chronology while Buddhism continued to spread and develop in other parts of the world
 buddha dharm kaa vikaas isa purv 6 ve shatabdi se prarambh hokar, samraat ashok ke samrajya tak, rajyadharm ke rup main hota rahaa
 It spread not only to all of India - China, Japan, Syam, Lanka, Afghanistan, Singapore and western countries of Asia
 samrat ashok jaisaa itihaas prasiddh samrat ne kaling yuddh ke pashchaat uske buddha dharm grahan karne par ise rajdharm bana diya gaya
 Some scholars have also said that Buddhism has declined due to the fall of moral conduct of the monks of Buddhism, but this is not true
 prayek dharm ki shuruyaat achche uddeshyon se hoti he kintu baad main isame tarah tarah kii bhrantiya aa jaati he vaise hi buddha dharm ke saath bhi hua tha
 But this reason alone is not enough
 baudhdhakaal ne naa keval vrihad vikaas kaa daur dekha he apitu shashakt pratham kendriya satta bhi dekhi he
 In this period, India became a center of spiritualism and knowledge
 buddha dharm ke teevr vistaar se us samay dharmik evam rajnatik ke atirikt aarthik vikaas bhi khub hua
 There are many reasons for the decline of Buddhism in India
 kuch vidwaanon ke kathananusaar bharatvarsh se buddha dharm ke lop ho jane kaa kaaran 'brahmanon kaa virodh' hi tha
 Earlier Brahmins of Buddhism followed the Vedic religion, so the arrival of Buddhism was a revolution against Brahmin religion in a way
 mauryaal main chuki samraat ashok ne boudhd dharm ko apana rajdharm bana liya tha atah iske aacharnanusaar vaidic balipratha par roak lagaadi thi jisase buddha dharm kaa kaaphi vistaar hua
 In retaliation, it was re-started by the later Sunga ruler

 Pushyamitra Shu is considered to have enmity with the Buddhists who burnt the scriptures of the Buddhaists and slaughtered the monks
 apni galati kaa kuprinaam bhogakar brahman jab punah sanbhale to ve buddha dharm kii baton ko hi apane shastron main dhoundkar batalaane lage or apane anuyaayiyon ko unka upadesh dene lage
 "to counter Buddhism, the scholars of Hinduism started propagating the path of knowledge and devotion on the place of ancient rituals
 kumaril bhatta or shankaracharya jaise vidwaanon ne mimasaa or vedant jaise darshanon kaa pratipaadan karke buddha dharm ke tatvagyan ko dabaaya or ramanuj, vishnu swami aadi vaishnav siddhant waalon ne bhakthi- maarg dwaara baudhon ke vyavhaar- dharm se badhkar prabhaavshaalee or chote se chote vyakti ko apane bhitarsthaan dene vaala vidhaan ko prachaarit kiya
 At the same time, many Hindu kings also stood up for the help of these missionaries
 is sabakaa parinaam yah hua ki jis prakaar buddha dharm aksmaat badhkar bada ban gaya or desh bhar main chaa gaya, usee prakaar jab vah nirbal padane laga, to uski jad ukhdate bhi der na lagi

 Today Buddhism is spread in many remote countries and whose number of followers is third in the world, but in India it is much less than most other religions
 iskaa bharat se is prakaar lop ho janaa bada hi durbhagyajanak hua he
 People began to consider Buddhism as a completely foreign religion, but on 14 October 1956, Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, the leader of the Dalits, came to India with his nearly 10 lakh followers on the ancient and equality of untouchability
 By adopting based religion, Buddhism has been revived on the same birth anniversary and today, Dalit Buddhism of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and all over the country The are
 is vivechan se ham is nishkarsh par pahonchte he ki sansar ke sabhi pramukh dharm logon ko nimna str ke jaivik mulyo se nikaalkar ucch mulyo ko praapt karne ke uddeshy se sthapit kiye gaye hai
 Parsis, Jews, Christians, Islam, etc
, in whatever condition the religion is today, but in the beginning, they did their welfare by driving their followers to the best values of life
 par kaal- kram se sabhi main kuch vyaktiyon yaa samudaay vishesh kii swarthparata ke kaaran vikaar utpann hue or tab unka patan hone laga
 Then some people felt the bad condition of their religion in their hearts and started trying the rituals by removing people from the wrong and harmful way
 buddha bhi is baat ko samajhate the or isliye yah vyavastha kar gayi the ki prayek sau varsh pashchaat sansar bhar ke buddha pratinidhiyon kii ek bady sabha kii jaae or usamen apane dharm tathaa dharmanuayiyon kii dasha par purna vichaar karke jo dosha jaan padey unako dur kiya jaae or naveen samyopayogi niyamon ko prachlit kiya jaae
 If it is considered necessary for the achievement of this purpose, then some minor things can be dropped and replaced by old practices and rules
 buddha dharmacharyon dwaara isi buddhisangat vyavastha par chalane or ruudhivaadita se bache rahane kaa yah parinaam hua ki buddha dharm kai sau varsh tak nirantar badhata rahaa or sansar ke doorvarti deshon ke nivasee aagrahpurvak is desh main aakar uski shiksha praapt karke apane yahan uskaa prachaar karte rahe
 This is the symptom of a religion which is motivated by the feeling of living and public welfare, that it does not insist on following the rituals or practices of the country-age in the name of antiquity or tradition
 varan sadaa aatm- nirikshan karata rahata he or kisi karanvash apane dharm main, apane samaaj main apni jati main yadi koi buraai, hanikaarak pratha-niyam utpann ho gaye hon to unako chhodane tathaa unka sudhaar karne main aagaa- peechha nahin karata
 Therefore, the biggest teaching of the Buddha is that human beings should always keep their religious, social conduct based on welfare and timely rules
 jo samaaj, majahab is prakaar apane dosha, vikaron ko sadaiv dur karte rahete hai, unako hi 'jivit' samajhnaa chahie or ve hi sansar main safalataa or ucch pad praapt karte hai
 The biggest error that has occurred in Hinduism at the present time
 vah yahi he ki isane aatm- nirikshan kii pravriti ko sarvatha tyaag diya he or 'lakeer ke fakir' bane rahane ko hi dharm kaa ek pramukh lakshan maan liya he
 The attitude of most of the people has become so limited that they also follow a very simple tradition - tradition, which has become prevalent for some reason in these hundred or two hundred years
 par aajkal spashtatah samay ke vipareet or hanikaarak siddh ho rahi he, chhodana 'dharm viruddh samajhate' hai
 At this time many harmful tendencies like child marriage, death row, marital dissipation, untouchability, eight thousand castes in place of four arnas, have entered the Hindu society, but as soon as the matter of their improvement is raised, the people 'sinking of religion Calling, we start to think that by paying attention to the teachings of Buddha God, we can understand so much that the real religion is in self-improvement and character-building, not in social secular practices
 yadi ham is tathy ko samaj len or parampara tathaa rudhio ke naam par jo kuda-kabad hamaare samaaj main bhar gaya he

 According to this legislation, three councils were appointed

 Napoleon began his second expedition to Italy in the spring of 1800 and after conquering Merengo forced Austria to the Treaty of Luneville, repeating all the conditions of the earlier campoforms

 The trade of all the nations of Europe ceased from England and enforced a strict control over the whole border of Europe

 Britain increased its compensation by increasing trade, but the economic condition of European nations began to deteriorate and they suffered from this torture of France
 sabase pehle spain ne is vyavastha ke viruddh vidroh kiya
 As a result, Napoleon invaded Spain and seized power there
 is par spain main ek rashtriya vidroh chhid gaya
 Napoleon could not suppress it, he had to suppress the rebellion of Austria, and then Prussa and Russia also disobeyed this system
 rus kaa vidroh nepolian ke liye vinaashkari siddh hua
 The ruin of his Moscow campaign has become famous in history
 paris lautakar nepolian ne pun: ek sena ekatra kii kintu lipatsig main use phir prasha, rus or austria kii sanmilit senaaon ne haraaya
 Due to the national struggle erupting all around, he could not actively suppress any nation and in 1814 AD was sent to the island of Elba
 mitra rashtron kii senaayen waapas bhi nahin ho paayin thim ki soochna mili ki nepolian kaa shatdivasiy shashan shuru hua
 The Allies therefore defeated him in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and imprisoned St
 Helena
 vahaan 1821 i main paanch may ko uski mrityu hui
 Napoleon Bonaparte took reforms in various areas in 1799 to consolidate his position in power and provide administrative stability to France
 vastutah diarectory ke shashan ko samaapt kar nepalian ne satta kii thi or france kii janata ne us parivartan ko sweekaar kiya tha to iskaa kaaran tha vah araajaktaa or avyavashtha se ub chuki thi
 Therefore, it was necessary for Napoleon to establish a well-organized governance and law and order in the interior
 pratham counsal banane ke baad nepolian ne france ke liye ek naveen samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya jo kranti yug kaa chauthaa samvidhan tha
 Through this, executive power was vested in three counselors
 pradhan counsal ko anya counsalaron se adhik shakti praapt thi
 In fact, the Republic certainly showed in the Constitution, but the entire power of the state was concentrated in the hands of Nepalis
 nepolian ne shashan vyavastha kaa kenndrikaran kiya or departments tathaa district kii sthaneey sarkaron ko samaapt kar prefect evam sab-prefects kii niyukti kii
 Their appointment and the appointment of all the mayors of villages and cities were directly done by the Central Government
 is prakaar prashasan ke kshetra nepolian ne in adhikariyon par paryaapt niyantran rakh prashasan ko chust-durust banaae rakhaa saath hi yogyata ke aadhaar par inaki niyukti kii
 Napoleon's reforms in administrative areas were in a way anti-revolution because the National Assembly had completely decentralized the administrative structure during the revolution and elected representatives were given the responsibility to govern the country, but the Nepalese gave this arrangement Reversed and reestablished pre-revolution system
 us drushti se vah kranti kaa hantaa tha
 Napoleon tried to revive France from its dismal economic situation
 is kram main usne sarvapratham kar pranali ko sucharu banaaya
 The task of collecting tax was done by the central employees and the recovery started strictly
 usne ghoosekhori, sattebaaji, thekedaari main anuchit munaafe par roak laga di
 He emphasized austerity and imposed many indirect taxes on the French people
 nepolian ne france main vittiya gatividhiyon ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye bank of france kii sthapana kii jo aaj bhi kaayam he
 It also set up a separate fund to repay the national debt
 nepolian ne jahaan tak sambhav hua sena ke kharch kaa boj vijit pradeshon par daalaa or france kii janata ko is boj se mukt rakhane kii koshish kii
 Napoleon also stressed the improvement of agriculture and planned to make the barren and sandy areas fertile
 vyapaar ke vikaas ke liye nepolian ne avaagaman ke sadhano kii taraf paryaapt dhyaan diya
 Arranged for mechanical education for the progress of various types of businesses, roads, canals built
 francisi audyogic vastuon ko lokapriy banane ke liye pradarshnee ke aayojan ko badhaava diya or swadeshi vastuon evam udyogon ko protsaahan diya
 Encouraged construction work to overcome the problem of unemployment
 is tarah nepolian ne france ko jarjar or diwaaliyepan kii sthit se ubaara
 But even in terms of economic reforms, Napoleon's actions appear to be anti-revolution
 krantikaal main pratyaksh karo par bal diya gaya tha jabaki nepolian ne apratyaksh karon par bal dekar puraatan vyavastha ko sthapit karne kii koshish kii
 In the same way, Napoleon displayed an anti-revolutionary mindset by prioritizing the commercialist philosophy
 uskaa maananaa tha ki rajya ko kosh kii suraksha evam vyapaar main santulan laane ke liye sakriy hastkshep karnaa hoga jabaki kranti kaa bal to mukt vyapaar par tha
 The Nepalese wanted citizens who had faith in him and his system
 iske liye usne shiksha ke rashtriya evam dharmanirpeksh swaroop apanaate hue sudhaar kiye
 Organized education at primary, secondary and higher levels
 sarkaar ke dwaara niyukt shikshakon kii sahaayta se chalane vaale in skulon main ek hi paathyakram, ek hi pathyapustaken ek hi vardi rakhi jaati thi
 Napoleon established a university in Paris and taught subjects in Latin, French, science, mathematics, etc
 yah uniwarsity vishvavidhyalay ke saamaanya arth main koi uniwarsity nahin thi varan praathmik se ucchtar shiksha tak kii sabhi sansthaaon ko ekasutra main baandhne vaali ek vyavastha kii
 Its aim was to keep maximum government control over education and to make students loyal to the government
 nepolian ne shodh kaaryon ke liye insticute of france kii sthapana kii
 Napoleon showed no interest in women's education
 unki shiksha kaa bhaar dharmik sansthaaon par chhod diya gaya
 The majority of France's population was under the influence of the Catholic Church
 kranti ke dauraan carch kii shakti ko kamjor kar use rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya
 Church property was nationalized and clergy were asked to take an oath of loyalty to the state
 isse pope naaraaz hua or aam janata ko virodh karne ke liye uksaaya
 As a result, there was tension between the government and the public
 nepolian ne ise dur karne ke liye 1801 se pope ke saath samjhauta kiya jise konkardet kaha jaataa he
 He had the following provisions
 nepolian kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn or sthaayee kaary tha- vidhi samhita kaa nirmaan
 In fact, before the revolution, the law and order of France was different and there were so many types of laws that even those who followed the law did not know them and this chaos increased even during the revolution
 nepolian ne is avyavashtha ko dur kiya
 Napoleon himself considered his Code of Law more powerful than his 40 wars
 is code ke dwaara nepolian ne france main sarvlokik kanoon paddati kii sthapana kii
 Under the Civil Code, he strengthened the authority of the head of the family
 striyaan purushon ke adheen rakhi gai or pati kaa kaary patni kii raksha karnaa he
 The divorce method was made difficult
 civil vivaah kii vyavastha bhi is samhita main kii gai
 Thus, by recognizing the practice of civil marriage and divorce, Napoleon practiced in Europe that the work of society could go on without the cooperation of the priests
 is prakaar anya samhitaayein jaise vyapaar sambandhi kanoon samhita, Code of Criminal Proc
 aadi banaae gaye
 The interests of the laborers were ignored in its trading code and the ban on their unions continued
 is drushti se nepolian ne kranti ke aadarshon ke viruddh kaary kiya
 Despite this, the importance of this law code was to provide uniformity of law throughout the country and to simplify the judicial system practically
 jahaan-jahaan nepolian kii senaayen gai yah samhita lagu kii gai or nepolian ke paraajay ke baad bhi barkaraar rahi
 It is a permanent fame of Napoleon
 nepolian ke vidhi samhita main burjua varg ke hiton par zyada jor diya gaya he
 The officer related to land was further strengthened and the protection of personal property was further strengthened and a number of laws were enacted to protect personal property
 tered union bananaa aparaadh ghoshit kiya gaya
 In case of litigation, the owners were asked to accept the claims of the owners in lieu of the arguments of the workers
 naagarik samhita kaa aadhaar saamaajik samta bhi he
 Privilege and feudal rule had no place in the Code
 bade putr ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikari maanane kaa kanoon bhi nahin tha sampatti par sabhi putron ko barabari kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Napoleon established a new elite in society
 usne aay ke hisaab se oopaadhiyon kaa kram nirdhaarit kiya
 This work of Napoleon was contrary to the ideals of revolution
 europe raajnneetik kshitij par nepolian kaa pradurbhaav ek ghumaketu kii tarah hua or apni prakriya tathaa parishram ke bal par vah sheeghra hi europe kaa bhaagyavidhaataa ban baitha
 In it, everyone was amazed by his amazing military and administrative abilities
 parantu uski shakti kaa stambh jaise baalu kii bhit par khadaa tha
 What collapsed within a few years was virtually the rise and fall of Napoleon like a dazzling meteor
 vah europe ke akaash main sainik safalataa ke bal par chamakta rahaa parantu paraajay ke saath hi uske bhagya kaa sitara dub gaya
 The empire, which was established after hard work, ended up seeing it, there were many reasons for its downfall which are all the same
 aseem mahatvakanksha- Napoleon was infinitely ambitious
 aseem mahatvakankshi kisi vyakti ke patan kaa mukhya kaaran sabit hoti he
 The same thing happened with Napoleon
 yuddh main jaise- jaise- uski vijay hoti gai vaise- vaise uski mahatvakanksha badhaata gaya or vah vishwa rajya kii sthapana kaa swapan dekhne laga
 He would not have to see the plight of the downfall if he was satisfied with a little and took care of the conquered empire and spent his time in it
 charitrik durbalata- Napoleon was full of courage, restraint and patience, but in his eyes, hatred was his vengeance and his stigma of forgiveness
 uske charitra kii badi durbalata yah thi ki vah sandhi ko sammanit samjhauta nahin maanata tha
 Friendship of any country was no more than a political necessity for him
 dhire- dhire vah ziddee banataa gaya use yah vishwaas tha ki uskaa prayek kadam thik he
 He could never forget, he began to ignore the advice of others
 falat: uske sachche mitra bhi usase dur hote chale gaye
 Napoleon's system was based on militarism- uski raajnneetik pranali sanyavad par aadhaarit thi jo iske patan kaa pradhan kaaran sabit hua
 He depended on the army in all matters, as a result he was always involved in war
 vah yah bhul gaya ki sainikwaad sirf sankat ke samay hi laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 As long as France was clouded by plagues, the people there supported him, as soon as the calamities came out, the people stopped supporting him
 francisi janata kii sahanubhuti or prem kaa khona uske liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Apart from this, the defeated nations became his enemies, who rose up against him as soon as the opportunity arose
 itihaaskaar kabbon ne thik hi likhaa he
 'napoleon's empire flourished in war The war was the basis of his existence and it ended in war itself
 ’ Defective military system prarambh main france kii sena desh prem kii bhaavana se otprot thi
 He used to fight for an ideal and to serve a purpose
 parantu jyon- jyon uske samrajya kaa vistaar hua sena kaa rashtriya rup vidhitat hota gaya
 At first, French troops were included in his army but later German German Purtagali and Dutch soldiers were added to it
 falat: uski sena anek rajyon kii sena ban gai
 There was no ideal and purpose before him
 at: uski sainik shakti kamjor padati gai or yah uske patan kaa mahatvapurn kaaran sabit hua
 Weakness of the Navy nepolian ne sthal sena kaa sanghathan thik se kiya tha kintu uske paas shaktishali nausena kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran use england se parajeet hona padaa
 If he had a powerful navy he would not have to be defeated by England
 vijit pradeshon main deshbhakti kaa abhaav- The territories he conquered were not in the hearts of the people, but he had goodwill and love for them
 ve nepolian kii shashan se ghrinaa karte the
 When his power began to weaken, his subordinate states began to strive for their independence
 europea raashtra ne uske khilaaf sangh ke liye chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or isi ke chalate waterlu ke yuddh main use parajeet hona padaa
 Enmity with the pope mahadwipiya vyavastha ke kaaran usne pope ko apana shatru bana liya
 When the Pope refused to accept the same continental system, he took over Rome in April 1808
 or 1809 i
 main pope ko bandi bana liya falat: catholicon ko yah vishwaas ho gaya ki nepolian ne keval rajyon kii swatantraaa nasht karne vaala daanav he
 Otherwise, they also destroy their religion
 audyogic kranti- It is said that he was defeated not in the grounds of Waterloo but in the factories of Manchester and the iron cladding of Barkingdhan
 audyogic kranti ke falswarup england main bade -2 kaarkaane khole gaye or dekhte hi dekhte england samrudh ban gaya
 As a result, he was able to meet his army's modern assassin, which proved fatal to Napoleon
 mahadwipiya vyavastha- The continental system was quite forgotten
 vah england ko sabase bada shatru maanata tha
 England's mainstay of power was naval and worldwide trade and Napoleon could not destroy his naval power, so his trade was tried to strike
 isi uddeshy se usne mahadwipiya vyavastha ko janm diya usne aadesh jari kiya ki koi desh england ke saath vyapaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And neither can use England made
 yah nepolian kii bhayankar bhul thi
 This arrangement trapped him in a trap that was difficult to get out of
 isliye mahadwipiya vyavastha iske patan kaa mukhya kaaran mana jaataa he
 War with the Portuguese purtegal kaa england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh tha kintu nepolian ke dawaab ke kaaran use england se sambandh todna padaa
 This caused considerable damage to Purtigal
 isliye usne phir se england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh kaayam kiya
 Napoleon was enraged and attacked Purtagal
 yah bhi nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Conflict with Spain nepolian kii teesri bhul spain ke aantarik maamle main hastkshep tha
 Millions of its soldiers were killed
 falat: is yuddh main uski sthiti bilkul kamjor ho gai
 Which encouraged his opponents, when Napoleon made his brother king of Spain, the residents there were not ready to consider that foreigner as king
 unhone nepolian kii sena ko spain se bhaga diya
 Other countries were also encouraged by that rebellion and they also started revolting, which made its fall inevitable
 rus kaa abhiyaan- Napoleon heavily invaded Russia and Russia did not accept its continental system
 isapar nepolian ne rus par akraman kar diya
 In this, however, Moscow was captured but it had to suffer great damage
 uske virodhiyon ne akraman karne kii yojana banaai
 He had to be defeated in this attack
 thakaan- He was tired of being constantly busy in many wars
 50 tourists have written that all the reason for the fall of Napoleon lies in the same word fatigue
 jyon- jyon vah yudadh main ulajhata gaya tyon- 2 uski shakti kamjor padati gai vah thak gaya or uske chalate bhi uskaa patan jaruri ho gaya
 Relative uske patan ke liye uske sage sambadhi bhi kam uttaradaayi nahin the
 However, he used to behave generously towards his relatives
 lekin jab bhi vah sankat main padataa tha to uske sambandhi uski madad nahin karte the
 Organization of quartz nepolian kii kamajori se laabh uthaakar uske shatruon ne chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or mitra rashtron ne use parajeet kiya
 He was captured and sent to Salbai and was made independent ruler there but Napoleon could not stay there for a long time
 He soon returned to France and became the ruler there
 lekin isbaar vah sirf sau dinon tak ke liye samraat rahe
 The Allies were finally defeated in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 AD
 vah pakad liya gaya mitra rashtron ne use kaidi ke rup main saint helena naamak tapu par bhej diya jahaan 52 varshon kii aayu main 1821 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Thus, all the above reasons were directly and indirectly responsible for his downfall
 He built his empire through war and it also fell due to the wars
 arthath jin tatwon ne nepolian ke samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha unheen tatwon ne uskaa vinaash bhi kar diya
