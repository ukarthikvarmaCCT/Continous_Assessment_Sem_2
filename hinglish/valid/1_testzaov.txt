bolshevik netaaon main keval trotski hi aise the jinhen lenin kaa pramukh saathi hone ke baavjood unke anuyaayi ke taur par nahin dekha jaataa tha
 In 1903, when the Russian Social People's Labor Party split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Trotsky did not support Lenin
 shuruyaat main unhone bolshavism kii yah kah kar ninda kii ki yah to sarvhaara kii nahin balki sarvhaara par taanaashaahee kaa formula he
 At that time he suspected that there were conspiratorial leaders like Lenin Robespierre because of which Russia's socialist movement would be misguided
 us samay trotski kaa vichaar tha ki gupt raajnneetik kaam karne vaali peshewar krantikariyon kii anushaasit party ke haath main kranti kii kaman dene se samaajwaad kaa lakshya nahin hasil kiya ja saktaa
 He was in favor of forming a party of a more democratic and open character
 1905 main ve saint petersburg kii soviet netaa ke rup main ubhare
 This first Soviet of Russia played a major role in the 1905 revolution, and Trotsky considered it a model of authentic democracy
 kranti vifal ho jane ke baad zaarshahi ne unhen giraftaar karke siberia bhej diya
 Trotsky escaped and spent the next decade in Europe
 is dauraan santhnik rup se ve menshavikon ke saath rahe
 When he returned to Russia in 1917, the Zarashahi had collapsed due to the February revolution
 ab ve bolshevikon ke saath aa gayi kyonki unhen laga ki unke or lenin ke vichaaron main kaaphi samanta aa chuki he
 Lenin himself was an admirer of Trotsky's political and theoretical abilities
 bolshevik party main trotski kaa kad teji se badha
 He participated in peace talks with the Germans as the commissioner of foreign affairs
 faujee kamisar ke rup main trotski ne laal sena ke gathan main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai or grih yuddh main uskaa shandaar netritv kiya
 These successes led to Trotsky being viewed as one of Lenin's possible successors
 lenin kii hi tarah trotski ko roosi sarvhaara varg kii rachanaatmak kshamtaaon main gaharaa vishwaas tha
 Based on this belief, he had a special kind of theoretical understanding that came out of the study of world capitalism
 trrotski kaa vichaar tha ki apane pichhadepan se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye kisi desh ko un charnon se kramvaar guzarane kii jarurat nahin hoti jinase viksit desh guzar chuke hote hai
 Symptoms of backwardness emerge along with backwardness in these countries
 is siddhanth ke aadhaar par vishleshan karte hue trotski ne dikhaaya ki rus kaa adhikansh bhaag pichhadaa or aviksit he lekin usamen pashchimi prabhaavon ne bhi ghuspaith kar lee he
 Developed methods of economic production and relations are being adopted in many places
 audyogic vikaas ke in mukaamon ne shahari kendron main ek acha-khaasaa sarvhaara varg or ek pashchimikrut bauddhik abhijan paidaa kar diya he
 As a result, radical forms of political resistance and activism have become prevalent
 chunki udyogikaran upar se thopa gaya he isliye sthaneey poonjipati varg kamjor he, lekin sarvhaara varg majboot he
 The capitalist class is afraid of carrying out a democratic revolution and is unable to fulfill its historical obligation due to its inability, hence this responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat
 kisaanon ko apane netritv main lete hue unke saath morcha bana kar majdoor varg ko samantshahi or uske sabhi avasheshon kaa unmoolan karte hue samaajwaad kii taraf badhanaa hoga
 Trotsky called his theory a permanent revolution
 1850 main marks communist lig kii general concil ko sambodhit karte hue is pad kaa istemaal kar chuke the
 According to Trotsky, farmers with a pre-capitalist mindset will not be able to support the workers in this revolutionary process for very long
 unki dilchaspee jameen kaa malikana mil jane tak hi rahegi
 a front made with farmers that paves the way for revolution will prove to be a hindrance in the creation of socialism
 isliye ek desh main, visheshtah rus main, samaajwaad kaa nirmaan tab tak safal nahin ho saktaa jab tak anya deshon main bhi kranti nahin ho jaati
 Therefore, the Russian Revolution should be seen as the initial phase of the world revolution, especially in developed countries
 dilachasp baat yah he ki trotski kii in baton or pratham vishwayuddh ke baad lenin dwaara pratipaadit kai siddhanton main kaafii samanta prathit hoti he
 Some Trotskyists have also alleged that Trotsky's principles were used by Lenin in the 1917 revolution
 yah alag baat he ki khud trotski ne 1917 main lenin kaa netritv sweekaar karne ke baad kabhi aisa nahin kaha
 After Lenin's death, Stalin wrote a paper about the construction of socialism in a country
 is maamle main bukharin jaise siddhantkaar bhi stallin ke saath the
 But Trotsky warned that the implementation of this principle would have disastrous consequences for Russia
 unhone kaha ki kheti ke samuhikeekaran kaa samay abhi nahin aayaa he
 Trotsky was also against limiting the comintern established by Lenin to the tools of Soviet foreign policy
 unka tark tha ki soviet sangh ko udyogikaran or aadhunikeekaran ke raste par jarur chalanaa chahie, par in uplabdhiyon ko samaajwaad kaa paryaay nahin samajha ja saktaa
 Socialism means higher productivity of labor, consequently better standard of living and society like the most developed forms of its capitalism
 yah tabhi ho saktaa he ki jab sarvhaara ke haath main vishwa-arthvyavastha kii bagdor ho
 Trotsky maintained that the Soviet system under Stalin should only be considered transitional
 abhi is baat kii guarantee nahin kii ja sakati ki iskaa vikaas samaajwaad main hoga yaa yah patit ho kar poonjeewaad ke kisi sanskaran main badal jaaegi
 Trotsky believed that the bureaucracy of Russia was taking the form of a new class
 bhale hi soviet samaaj rajkeey poonjeewaad kii sthiti main na pahunchaa ho, lekin uski sthiti mazdooron ke ek kamatar rajya jaisi to he hi
 The special feature of Trotsky's ideas was that he was opposed to the tendencies of seeing Marxism as the infallible medicine of every problem
 isi tarah ve marxvad ke naam par kala-sahitya or gyaan ke vibhinn kshetron ko ek vishesh disha main dhakele jane ke bhi khilaaf the
 Despite his radical views, he could not do a majority of the party in his favor
 party ke bheetar unhen ek aise netaa ke rup main dekha jaataa tha jo sankat aane par to karishmai netritv pradaan kar saktaa he, lekin party ke bheetar hone vaali rosemara kii uthaa-patake se nibatane main dilchaspee nahin rakhata, or jo apni bauddhik chamak-damak main akelaa rahanaa pasand karata he
 When there was no revolution in Europe as Trotsky had hoped, he blamed the Stalinian project of abandoning the goal of world revolution and trying to build socialism in only one country
 trotski ne yah kabhi nahin mana ki stalinkaaleen galatiyon kii jad main party or raajnneeti kaa leninist-bolshevik vichaar he jiske kaaran ek party dwaara sanchalit rajya puure samaaj ko apana taabedaar banane main kaamyaab ho gaya he
 Indeed, Trotsky never reiterated his harsh criticisms of Lenin and Bolshevism from 1903 to 1914, even though he suffered expulsion in the third period of life

 For example, the dialing code for Guam is +1 followed by the area code 671 - not +671 or +1671
 Originally larger countries, such as France, were assigned two-digit codes and small countries, such as Iceland, were assigned three-digit codes; however since the 1980s all new assignments have been three-digit regardless of countries’ sizes
 CCITT, the predecessor of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector, developed the first formal list of telephone country codes
 This list was included in the 1964 CCITT Blue Book, among other international telecommunication recommendations, which would eventually become ITU-T recommendation E
164
 An earlier system of country codes for European use was mentioned in the 1960 CCITT Red Book

 The World Bank soon became frustrated that progress with this shortage

 Finally, in 1954, after nearly two years of negotiations, the World Bank offered its own proposal, stepping beyond the limited role it was apportioned to itself and forcing both sides to consider concrete plans for the future

 While the Indian side was liable to the World Bank's proposal, Pakistan found it unacceptable
 vishwa bank aavantit purvi nadiyon ke liye bharat or pashchimi nadiyon pakistan ke liye
 This new distribution did not account for the historical use of the Indus basin, or the fact that the eastern districts of West Punjab could change the desert and Pata conditions of Pakistan's interaction

 December 1954, the two sides returned to the negotiating table
 The proposal of the World Bank was changed to negotiate a basis for the settlement of a base and continued negotiations, stop and go, for the next six years

 jantuon main asankhya jantu aise hote hai jinhen keval bahya chihnon se hi nar, yaa maadaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Male and female are judged by two types of signs, primary and secondary sexual characteristics
 vanaspatik jagat main nar tathaa maadaa kaa bhed, viksit praaniyon kii bhanti, pruthak-pruthak nahin paaya jaataa
 Which is true
 aaj hindi main ling yani ling shabd kaa arth nar shishn se lagaaya jaataa he lekin mul sanskrit main iskaa arth chihn, pratik athwa lakshan ke arth main he
 This word appears several times in the Vaishneshika philosophy of Kanad Muni
 janan kaa itihaas dekha jaae to gyaat hoga ki sansar ke aadi jeevon kii utpatti alangik dhang se hui; jaise protozoa tathaa protophita ke anek roopon main nar tathaa maadaa dwaara milakar sristi nahin hui
 These organisms originated through body fragmentation, Mukulan and spore formation
 vikaas ke duusare charan main nar tathaa maadaa ke atyant sookshm lakshan prakat hone lage
 Some other organisms in the Protozoa range began to produce offspring by conjugation
 isamen ek hi prakaar ke do jeev aapas main milakar ekaakaar hone par phir vibhajit hokar anek sankhya main utpann hone lage, jaise volvox ke nivahon main dekha jaataa he
 After this came the third stage of penis development, in which both male and female genitals developed inside the same creature, eg, earthworm, leech etc

 The male creature has penis and the female has a fistula
 katipay anya jeevon main gaun langik lakshanon ke antargat munch, dadhi, sundar tathaa bhadkile pankh, sir kii kalgi, sing, stan, prabhutv jamaana, madhur swar, maatrutiv kii ichha, akraman kshamta aadi aate hai

 vaigyanikon ne is sambandh main kai siddhant upasthit kiye hai
 Among these theories, the following two theories are relatively more famous: chromosome, or chromosome theory, and hormone theory
 anuvanshik vigyaan ke anusaar praaniyon ke sharir main jo koshikaaye pai jaati hai, unamem kuch aisi rachanaayen hoti he jo vishesh prakaar ke ranjakon or abhiranjakon ko grahan kar leti hai, in rachanaaon ko chromosome kaha jaataa he
 In genetic science, only chromosomes found in gametes, or sex cells, are considered
 bhinn-bhinn praaniyon kii janan koshikaon main chromosomon kii sankhya is prakaar pai gai hai : Creature name --- number of chromosomes saikan spanj -- 26 Hydra --- 30 - 32 lambricus vansh kii jonk --- 32 Unio Oyster --- 32 taramin --- 36 Lobster --- 48 bichchhi --- 24 a fish --- 24 buphotod --- 24 - 26 Kachchhagana --- 56 magar --- 32 Sheep --- 60 ghoda --- 60 - 66 Monkey --- 48 maanav --- 46 Netrix --- 40 kapotvansh yaa colambaa --- 66 Cock --- 18 - 20 chamagadad --- 24 Rabbit of Leapus clan --- 28 - 36 kutta --- 50 - 78 Fox --- 38 billi --- 66 Chopped --- 38 - 60 bakra --- 60 Buffalo --- 48 - 56 boar --- 38 - 40 Chimpanzee --- 48 oont --- 70 In 1901–2, a scholar named mcclung discovered the chromosome
 usee ne kuch siddhant bhi banaae, jo kalantar main vaigyanik anusandhanon dwaara pusht hote gaye
 In this theory it is assumed that the sex of each creature depends on the number of certain chromosomes
 chromosomon kii rachana ko yadi adhik shaktishaalee sookshmdarshi, jaise electron sookshmdarshi dwaara dekha jaae to usamen bhi kuch bahut hi sookshm rachanaayen dikhaai padegi
 They are called genes and it is believed that these transmit the genetic properties of the parent to their offspring
 jantuon or vanaspatiyon ke chromosomon tathaa jeenon ko lekar bahut adhik anusandhan or prayog hue hai
 It has been found that some of the chromosomes found in the reproductive cells of each living organism are known as alingusutra
 ye nar tathaa maadaa donon main ek prakaar ke hi hote hai or sadaa yugma main rahete hai
 Some other types of chromosomes are also found, which are called sex determinants
 ab tak jitne prakaar ke chromosome paae gaye hai, unhen eks, vaai, dablyoo, zed tathaa o kii sangya di gai he
 Male and female are believed to be determined by the same and odd number of these sex-bearing chromosomes, such that sex in humans is determined as follows: 21 aling sutara + 1 eks + 1 vaai = purush; tathaa 21 Alling Sutra + 2x = Female
 chromosomon kii sankhya ke anusaar nar tathaa maadaa ko vishamyugmaki yaa samayugmaki kaha jaataa he
 a creature has a male homozygote, then a female
 pakshiyon, titliyon, machhliyon, jalsthalchar aadi main maadaa vishamyugmaki hoti he
 In these animals, the sex-bearing chromosomes are named z and W, while in other animals and flora, they are referred to as x and Y
 anek praaniyon main eks tathaa vaai hi nar yaa maadaa ling kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 When a sperm with x is combined with a female's egg, the zygote receives two X's and becomes a female
 kintu jab shukranu kaa vaai maadaa ke andey ke eks se sanyukt hota he, tab yugmanaj ko eks vaai, arthath visham sankhya praapt hoti he or vah nar hota he
 The differentiation found in the chromosomes of males and females of humans and other creatures is shown in the table on the next page
