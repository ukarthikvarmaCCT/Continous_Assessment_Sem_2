 UML provides a mechanism to represent class members: such as attributes and methods and additional information about them
 ek varg ke sadsy kii drishyata ko sunishchit karne ke liye yahaan nimnlikhit sanket die ja rahe hai, jinka prayog sadsy ke naam se pehle zarur kiya janaa chahie
 : UML sadasyon ke liye do prakaar ke kaaryakshetra hote he : drushtaant or vargikaarak
 drushtaantaparak sadasyon ke maamle main, kaaryakshetra ek vishisht drushtaant hota he
 In terms of characteristics, this means that its importance may vary depending on the illustrations and examples
 paddation ke maamle main iskaa arth yah he ki iskaa aahvaan drushtaantaparak sthiti ko prabhavit karata he, duusare shabdon main, drushtaant visheshtaon ko prabhavit karata he
 Otherwise the classifier member contains the workspace class
 visheshtaon ke maamle main, iskaa matlab yah he ki iskaa mahatv sabhi drushtaanton ke liye baraabar he
 In the case of methods, this means that its call does not affect the illustrative condition
 The classifier member is usually identified as "static" in many programming languages
 koi sadsy vargikaarak kaaryakshetra he yah jataane ke liye uske naam ko rekhaankit zarur kar diya janaa chahie
 Otherwise, the scope of the instance will be taken as the default
 sambandh ek saamaanya shabd he jo ek vishisht prakaar ke taarkik sangyojan main varg or padaarth rekhachitr samet letaa he
 UML illustrates these relationships: ek link vastuon ke bich buniyadi sambandh hota he
 It represents a line connecting two or more object boxes
 yah ek vastu rekhachitr yaa varg rekhachitr ke rup main dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Link is an example of a relationship
 ek sangyojan link ke ek parivaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Double combinations usually represent a sequence, with each end joining a square box
 upree kram ke sangyojan main yah do se adhik siron ke saath taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In such cases all the ends are connected by a central diamond
 kisi sangyojan kaa namakaran kiya ja saktaa he or sangyojan ke ek siron ko uski bhoomika ke naam, swatv suchak, bahulya, drishyata samet anya visheshtaon se sanvaara ja saktaa he
 There are five different types of combinations
 aamtaur par sangyojan dwi-dishaatmak or ek-dishaatmak hote hai
 For example, a flight class combination is bi-directional to the aircraft
 sangyojan keval varg chitra ke jariye dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Example: "courses offered by the Department", is a connected relationship
 ekatrikaran sanyojit sambandh kaa hi ek paryaay he; lekin ekatrikaran sangyojan se kahin zyada sateek he
 It is a combination that represents a relationship in whole or in part
 sangyojan ke ek prakaar ke rup main ekatrikaran kaa namakaran kiya ja saktaa he or iskaa alankaran sangyojan kii hi tarah kiya ja saktaa he
 However, an aggregation cannot consist of more than two classes
 ekatrikaran tabhi hota he jab ek varg anya virgon kaa sanchayan ho yaa dharak ho, lekin jahaan anivaary rup se samavisht varg ke dharak ke jeevanchakra kii adheenta majboot na ho vahaan bhale hi dharak nasht ho jaataa ho; par to isamen nihit saamagree par koi aanch nahin aati
 In UML, the last sequence of the tree that connects the holder class to the containing square, is graphically shown in the shape of a hollow diamond
 sanrachana sanyojak sambandh kaa ek paryaay he, lekin sanrachana ekatrikaran se kahin adhik sateek he
 It can be shown in the shape of a solid diamond
 vaise to aamtaur par sanrachana ke drushtaant ke dharak varg or drushtaant ke nihit varg ke bich ek majboot jivan chakra nirbharta hoti he, lekin agar paatr nasht kar diya he to saamaanya taur par usamen maujuud sabhi drushtaant bhi nasht ho jate hai
 The remarkable thing is that a part of the compound can be destroyed before it is erased and thus the entire part of it will not be destroyed
 samavisht varg ke vriksh ke aakhri kram main sanrachana sambandh ko bhare hue heere ke madhyam se UML ke rekhachitr main dikhaaya ja saktaa he, jo samavisht varg ko nihit varg se jodta he
 The entire structure should have a variation of 0

1 or 1, indicating that a part should be for the entire part
 kisi ekatrikaran ke sampoorn bhaag kii koi bhi vividhta honi chahie
 When attempting to represent the overall relationship of the real world, for example take a car engine, the structural relationship is very accurate
 baharhaal, jab kisi software yaa database sambandh, misaal ke taur par; car model kaa ingine ENG01 car model CM01 kaa hissaa hota he, kaa maamla ho to ekatrikaran sambandh sabase acha hota he, kyonki ingine ENG01 kisi bhi duusare car kaa hissaa ho saktaa he
 That's why the aggregation relationship is often called a "nomenclature", whose retention is different from the "physical" retention of the structure
 ' The generalization relationship indicates that one of the two related classes is considered special to the other and this supertype is considered a sub-type of "generalization"
 vyavhaarik rup main iskaa matlab yah he ki up prakaar kaa koi udahaaran mahaprakaar kaa bhi udhaaharan he
 This type of aggregation is worthy of illustration of the tree binomial nomenclature; Humans, for example, are a wild subtype, a subtype of mammals
 aise hi or bhi udahaaran he
 The relation is easily understood through a phrase 'AB is'
 samanyikaran main mahaprakaar ko khokhale trikoniya aakaar main kram ke aakhir main UML rekhachitr se darshaya ja saktaa he, jo ki ise ek yaa adhik up prakaaron se jodta he
 The generalization relationship is also known as inheritance or "implicit"
 samanyikaran sambandh main mahaprakaar "janak ", utkrisht varg, mul varg, buniyadi prakaar ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 The subtype in generalization relation is also called "infant", subclass, derived class, derived type, inheritance class, and inheritance type
 ullekhneey he ki yah sambandh jaivik mata pita / bachche ke rishte main koi samanta pradarshit nahin karata he, halanki in shabdon ke prayog bahut aam he, lekin phir bhi yah bhraamak ho sakate hai
 The generalization can only be shown on the square diagram and used in the box diagram
 UML modelling main, pratiti sambandh do model tatwon ke bich kaa sambandh he, jisamen ek model tatv vishesh rup se nirdisht doosraa model tatv ke aacharan ko samajhataa he
 The realization is represented by the end of an unconfined arrow pane from the supplier
 pratiti keval varg yaa sanghatak rekhachitr par dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 Realization is a relationship between classes, interfaces, components, packages, which connects the customer element to the supplier element
 pratiti virgon va antarfalkon ke bich or sanghatakon va antarfalkon ke bich kaa sambandh yah darshata he ki antarfalak dwaara prastaavit kaary ko varg sampadit karata he
 Dependency is a weak form of relationship indicating that one class depends on another because it uses it at the same time
 agar varg kaa maandand anya varg kii paddati ke anusaar parivartansheel yaa sthanik parivartansheel ho to nirbharta vidyaman hoti he
 The combinatorial relationship implies that one of the two related classes makes reference to each other
 samanyikaran sambandh ke ulat ise badi hi aasaani se ek vaakyansh ke madhyam se samajha ja saktaa he ki a ke paas b he The sequence of combinations UML shows its relationship by describing the role of the object through an optional arrow, and at the end of it all the various positions of the power illustration through an alternative signal
 saamaanya vividhtaayen is prakaar hai : 


 In the early stages of technical analysis of a project, the class diagram is used to present the conceptual paradigm of the table
 is str par varg aksar simaaon, niyantran or satta kaa rup letaa he tathaa virala hi bagaiyr kisi badlaav ke tik paata he
 The boundary class controls the communication between the actors and the internal components of the system
 ve upyogkarta antarfalak, sarini antarfalak yaa upkaran antarfalak ho sakate hai
 The use-case of each of these actors is usually identified by using the use-case of the table
 inhen ek bade se vruton main ek choti-si lakeer ke madhyam se baanyi ore sate vrutt ke baraabar kii oonchai par khadi lakeer khich kar dikhaaya jaataa he 
 vaikalpik rup se, saamaanya virgon main ye «seemaa» ke saath aupchaarik sanket main varg ke naam ke upar dikhaaye ja sakate hai
 The information that the power class prepares is governed by tables, but sometimes conduct is also associated with information
 inaki pahchaan aadharbhoot ankada talika yaa ankada bhandar ke rup main nahin honi chahie
 They are made in a circle form on a horizontal line downwards in such a way that it extends over the entire width of the circle
 vaikalpik rup se, inhen ek saamaanya varg ke rup main aupchaarik sanket «ikai» ke saath varg ke naam ke upar taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The control class handles the flow of control for the use-case and therefore looks like a combination class
 yuj cese main ye sab kuch nahin karte, lekin duusare virgon ke saath sahyog karte hai; jo unke liye kaam kar saken
 These are shown in the form of an arrow in the shape of an arrow by placing it at the top left of the circle
 vaikalpik rup se, inhen saamaanya virgon main aupchaarik sanket »niyantran« ke saath varg ke naam upar dikhaaya ja saktaa he

 In the fourth and final stage infestations occur, due to the spread of the virus in the cornea and the art of eyelids shrinking
 anya rogon ke sankraman kaa pravesh bahut saral he or praayah sadaa hi ho jaataa he
 As a result of these diseases, the following conditions arise in the mucosa, cornea and eyelids: rohe kaa sankraman rogagrast balak yaa vyakti se angulii, athwa tauliya, roomaal aadi vastron dwaara swasth balak main pahunchakar usko rogagrast kar detaa he

 penicillin se is rog main koi laabh nahin hota; haan, anya sankraman usase avashya nasht ho jate hai
 For this disease, Oromycin, Terra Mycin, Chloramycin etc
 are used a lot
 hamaare anubhav main salphacitamide or niomycin donon ko milakar prayog karne se santoshjanak parinaam hote hai
 The imide-mycetin, which is the sum of these two, should be applied four times a day, for six to eight weeks
 saath hi jal main boric acid, zinc or adrinaline ke ghol kii boonden netra main daalate rahanaa chahie

 is rog ke kaaran hamaare deshavaasiyon kii bahut badi sankhya janm bhar ke liye aankhon se haath dho baithti he
 It is estimated that 30 percent of individuals have the disease from gonococcus, 30 percent from staphylo or streptococcus, and the rest from bacillus and virus infections
 pichley das varshon main yah rog penicillin or salphonamide ke prayog ke kaaran bahut kam ho gaya he
 Within three days of birth, the eyes become swollen and thick white secretion starts coming out from the eyelids
 yadi yah srav chauthe din ke pashchaat nikle to samajhnaa chahie ki sankraman janm ke pashchaat hua he
 a drop of secretion from the inside of the eyelids, from a glass of purified glass to a glass slide, has to be examined by microscope after it is pigmented by spreading it on a glass slide
 kintu pariksha kaa parinaam jaanane tak chikitsa ko rokna uchit nahin he
 The therapy should be started immediately
 rog ko rokane ke liye janm ke pashchaat hi boric loshan se netron ko svachh karke unamem penicillin ke ek si

 If full treatment is started at the beginning of the disease, then there is a high chance of the patient getting rid of the disease
 hamaare desh main kusht uttar pradesh, bengal or madras main adhik hota he or abhi tak yah bhi andhata kaa ek vishesh kaaran tha
 But here due to the special events of diagnosis and treatment of the disease by the government, this disease has now reduced greatly and thus the number of blind persons due to leprosy has decreased
 kusht rog do prakaar kaa hota he
 One in which nerves are innervated
 doosraa vah jisamen charm ke neeche gulikaay yaa choti-choti gaanthen ban jaati hai
 Both types of disease can cause blindness
 pehle prakaar ke rog main saatvin yaa naveen naadee ke aakraant hone se upree palak kii peshiyon kii kriya nasht ho jaati he or palak band nahin hota
 This causes inflammation of the mucosa and cornea, then ulcers are formed

 In this disease, the dow inside the eye increases, and the field of vision decreases, even at some time it completely disappears and the person becomes blind
 ant main drushti-naadee-kshay bhi ho jaataa he
 Eyes are seen as normal from outside, but the person does not see anything
 rog hone par, naadeekshay ke purv, mahamarishoth kii saamaanya chikitsa ke atirikt carnia or shwetpatal ke sangam sthaan par ek chota chhed kar diya jaataa he

 Its special symptoms are eye pain, redness, watery secretions, visual impairment, shallow anterior eye and increased inner eye pressure
 adhiktar, ugr rup main pidaa or anya lakshanon ke teevr hone par hi rogi doctor kii salaah letaa he
 If the doctor is an expert in eye diseases, he recognizes the disease and conducts appropriate treatment, so that the patient is not blind
 kintu jeern rup main lakshanon ke teevr na hone ke kaaran rogi praayah doctor ko tab tak nahin dikhaata jab tak drushtikshay utpann nahin ho paata, parantu tab laabhprad chikitsa kii aashaa nahin rahati
 The attacks of this type of disease occur intermittently
 akramanon ke bich ke kaal main rog ke koi lakshan nahin rahete
 Only the shallowness of the forearm remains, which is not known to the patient
 isse rog ke nidaan main bahudhaa bhram ho jaataa he
 The second disease that causes confusion is cataract, which usually occurs in older age
 jeern praathmik samalvaay bhi isi avasthaa main hota he
 For this reason, gradually increasing blindness can be understood to be the result of cataract, although its real cause is usually in which there is no benefit from weapons
 vriddhavastha main drishtihraas hone par rogi kii pariksha saavdhaanee se karnaa aavashyak he
 Punctuality can be prevented from piercing at the beginning of the samway
 yah praayah vriddhavastha kaa rog he
