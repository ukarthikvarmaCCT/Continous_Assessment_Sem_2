 Last month, 10-12 people were injured in the Diwali fair in Delhi's Anand Vihar
 anand vihaar main aman jyoti cheritable trust kadivalimela laga tha
 a swing of the fair fell in the late evening
 isse pehle gujarat ke ahmedabad main kankaria adventure park main isi tarah kaa haadasa hua tha
 Here 3 people were killed due to the swing, while 28 people were injured
 das saal kii umr tak anandiben patel mehsana jile ke kharod gaanv main sthit apane kheton main pita kaa haath bantaya karti thim
 Working in the fields, he understood the value of hard work and persistence
 aise sabak, jo is anbhavi netaa ke ab aage kaam aaenge, ab, jab ve gujarat ko narendra modi ke baad vaale yug main aage badhaane ja rahi hai
 It is not easy to fill Modi's vacant space in Gujarat
 lekin 72 saal kii anandiben main modi kii upyukt uttaradhikari banane kii puri yogyata he
 Throughout his life he has always faced various adversities and won over them
 jab ve paanchavin kaksha main thim, tabhi unke pita jethabhai kalidas patel ne saamaajik varjanaaon ko todate hue unka daakhila ladakon ke skool main karaayaa tha
 This led to tears from the people of his community, but Anandiben continued her studies
 do saal tak ve puure skool main akeli ladki thim
 a few years later, when his sister Saritaben (now 95) married a boy of her choice from his own caste Leuva Patel, the community stopped her family's hookah for five years
 parivaar ke liye yah bahut kathin samay tha, lekin anandiben majbootee se dati raheen or apni shiksha puri kii
 He got a teacher job in a government-aided school
 1970 ke dashak ke shuruaati varshon main adhyaapan ke dauraan hi unhone emessi (gold medalist) or amed kii padhai bhi puri kii
 In 1988, Anandiben, Principal of Mohiniba Girls School, Ahmedabad, was awarded the 'gujarat Enterprise and Courage Award'
 ek picnic ke dauraan unhone apni do chaatraon ko nadi main doobane se bachaaya tha
 In 1992, he received the National Award for Best Teacher from the then President Shankar Dayal Sharma
 us samay tak bijepi main bhi anandiben kaa kad kaaphi badaae laga tha
 The party's youth state organization minister, Modi, recognized his qualifications and in 1988 had linked him to the party
 bijepi tab gujarat main apni jagah banane kii koshish kar rahi thi or use nae mahatvakankshi chehron kii talash thi
 The respected principal of a school, who had also won the Bravery Award, was suitable for this
 anandiben ne 1988-90 main rajya ke sookhaa prabhavit logon ke bich ullekhneey kaary kiya tha, jise dekhte hue varsh 1990 main unhen bijepi ke rajya mahila morche kii adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 Subsequently, during the campaign for the 1991 Lok Sabha elections, Anandiben established herself as a skilled speaker and organizer
 iske baad ke varshon main unhone gujarat bijepi main apni alag jagah banaai, lekin ve modi or unke vishwast amit shah ke prati vafaadaar baniin raheen
 Even in such an environment when Modi had to fight with Shankar Singh Vaghela or Keshubhai Patel, Anandiben sided with Modi
 modi shaayad hi kabhi duusare mantriyon ko apane sachiv chunane kii chhot dete hai
 Despite Narendra Modi's extremely harsh working style as Chief Minister, Anandiben kept up with him and gradually gained his trust and confidence
 sarkaar main apni lambii pari ke dauraan maujuuda mukhyamantri anandiben ne teji se nirnay lene kii kshamta, baarikiyon par dhyaan dene or rajya ke gahan aadhikarik daure kii vajah se afasarshahi main kaaphi sammaan hasil kiya he
 When she first became a minister in the Keshubhai Patel government in 1998, all the portfolios she held since then were transformed
 1998 se 2007 ke bich shiksha mantri ke rup main unhone shikshakon kii niyukti or transfar ke maamalon main bhrashtachar ko khatm kiya
 He hired 1,00,000 new teachers and built 80,000 classrooms to repair the state's ravaged primary education system
 2007 se ve jis rajasav mantralay ko sambhaal rahi thim, usamen lalaphitaashahee ko kam kiya or technology kaa istemaal shuru kiya
 Started projects like e-land to prevent forgery and secure the ownership of farmers
 unhone jamini str par prashasan ko sudhaarney ke liye tehsil str par i-gavarnence lagu kiya
 Modi had praised him and said, "he has left an indelible mark in the revenue department by making such changes, which i have wanted for a long time
" ”unhone shahari vikaas mantralay main bhi kai doorgaami parivartan kiye
 During his 18-month tenure, the number of finalizing town planning plans rose from 30-40 to 100 in a year
 shahari vikaas yojanaon ko antim rup dene kii sankhya bhi 5-10 se badhkar kareeb 20 tak pahunch gai
 Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Shankarbhai Chaudhary said, "whatever departments he handled, he definitely did something new in them due to his efficient operation
 ”haalanki anandiben kii kuch simaaen bhi hai
 They are not very popular among BJP workers
 bahut se log unhen ahamkaari maanate hai
 He has sometimes given support to the wrong people, due to which his understanding has been questioned
 unke kehane par modi ne 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main do alokapriy netaaon kamabhai rathod or pragaji patel ko kramash: sanand or viramgam seat se tikat dilwaaye
 Both were defeated
 aresas ke saath bhi unke rishte thik-thik hi hai
 His relationship with the Sangh is mainly because of Modi, because he is close to Modi
 ek mukhyamantri ke rup main ab unki kadi pariksha hogi kyonki kisi bhi tarah kii galati se aisi rajnatik anischitata paidaa hone kaa dar he
 By 2004, Modi had also faced uncertainty from the legislators within the party
 jaisaa ki modi ke aane ke pehle rajya bijepi main thi
 However, Anandiben is confident about her success
 unhone kaha, ''narendrabhai ne buniyaad rakh di he, mujhe bas gati ko banaae rakhana he
 i will maintain policy-based governance
 meraa uddeshy yah sunishchit karnaa he ki saadhaaran se saadhaaran aadmi ko bhi nyaay mili

 After the crushing defeat of the Indian team in the Pune Test, the pitch is constantly under question
 mangalvaar ko isisi ne pune kii pich ko kharaab retings di
 After this, the career of pitch curator Daljit Singh seems to be threatening
 isse pehle bhi dalajit aisi pich taiyaar kar chuke hai jis par teen din ke andar hi match khatm ho gaya tha
 Daljit Singh is the chief pitch curator of BCCI
 bharat or australia ke bich khele gaye pehle test match kii pich dalajit ke maargdarshan main hi taiyaar kii gai
 The pitch played so poorly that the Test match ended within three days and India suffered a crushing defeat
 test match ke baad lagaataar pich ko lekar charchaa rahi
 On Tuesday, the International Cricket Association called the Pune pitch bad
 nagpur pich par bhi uthe the sawalbharat or dakshin africa ke bich november 2015 main nagpur main siries kaa teesraa test match khelaa gaya
 The match also ended within three days and the hosts won
 magar isisi match referi jaiff kro ne nagpur kii us pich ko kharaab qaraar diya
 Interestingly, this Nagpur pitch was also prepared under the guidance of Daljit Singh
 khatre main dalajit kii kursibisisiai ko ab is maamle main isisi ko 14 din ke andar jawaab bhejnaa hoga
 However, it is being told that no instruction was given to the team management and BCCI to prepare such a pitch
 aise main dalajit kharaab pich ke liye puure tareeke se jimmedaar tehraae ja sakate hai
 If this happens, he may have to lose his position as chief pitch curator
 aisa isliye bhi kyonki 14 mahino ke andar isisi kii yah duusari pratikul reating he
 News agency PTI quoted BCCI sources as saying that Daljit could have refused to prepare such a pitch even if the team management had instructions

 Whereas, if sources are to be believed, Daljeet has been giving wickets as per the wishes of the team management

 Sadasivam has said that there is no need to change the collegium system and impeachment provisions in the constitution related to appointment of judges in higher courts
 unhone is aalochana ko khaarij kiya ki yah paardarshee nahin he or sarkaar kii isamen koi bhoomika nahin he
 Sadashivam said, however, that the judiciary welcomes any good suggestions or steps to improve the current system of appointment
 sarkaar kii is baat se sahmati jataate hue ki sarkaar ucch nyaayalayon or ucchtam nyaayalay ke nyaayadhishon kaa ‘chayan’ karne kii sthiti main nahin he, unhone kaha ki vah mahasoos karte hai ki pranali ko badalane kaa ekmaatr rasta yah he ki sarkaar is sambandh main apane do mahatvapurn faislon kii samiksha kare yaa phir sanvaidhanik sanshodhan kare
 Justice Sadasivam admitted that there is corruption in the judiciary like other organs of the government, but 'it is non-existent
 ’ samvidhan ke mahabhiyog ke praavdhaanon kaa majbootee se bachaav karte hue unhone kaha ki juthi shikayaton or hataane ke prayaason se ucch adaalaton ke nyaayadhishon ko majboot suraksha die jane kii jarurat he
 Justice Sadashivam, who is going to take charge as the Chief Justice on 19 July, however, admitted that there is a flaw in the internal mechanism to deal with the problem of removing corrupt judges and it would be necessary to see the system reformed
 That the system was destroyed
 unhone kaha, ‘yah kahana sahi nahin he ki (nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main) koi paardarshita nahin he or sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 He was replying to a question about the government's steps to bring in a law that would interfere with the executive in the selection and appointments of judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne 1993 main ek aadesh ke jariye niyuktiyon main collegium pranali ko aage badha diya tha, jisase sarkaar ko alag rakhaa gaya
 Under the present system, the Chief Justice of the High Courts, in consultation with the two senior most judges, recommends the names of the anticipated judges
 sadashivam ne kaha ki prastaav pramann, jaanch parakh or tippaniyon ke liye centre, mukhyamantriyon, rajyapalon or khufia agenciyon jaise vibhinn channelon se hokar gujarata he
 He said, 'the Chief Minister has to give comments, the Governor has to express his opinion, the Center gives its comments and the Intelligence Bureau acts to authenticate the authenticity of the candidates, their political affiliations, if any
 ’ collegium ke baahar ke nyaayadhishon, jaani maani hastiyon sahit swatantra logon se bhi raay maangi jaati he
 Justice said, 'the only complaint is that they (the government) cannot select the candidates
 ’vartmaan pranali ko uchit tehraate hue manonith pradhan nyaayadhish ne kaha ki collegium (chayan mandal) ke sadsy pad par kaaphi anubhav ke baad pahunchate hai
 They read the judgments of the anticipated judges in terms of promotions and talk to the judicial agencies and bars of the states to get personal information about the situation
 unhone kaha, ‘main unki (sarkaar kii) kshamta ko kam karke nahin aank rahaa hum, lekin (nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main) ham behatar sthiti main hai
 Referring to the judgments given by the benches (which included the late Justice JS Verma in 1993 and one later in 1998), Justice Sadasivam said that these are valuable documents on the subject and are difficult to ignore
 unhone kaha, ‘sirf bhagwaan yaa badi peeth in faislon ko badal sakati he
 The government will have to review the decisions or bring constitutional amendments
 ’nyaayamurti ne kaha ki haalanki, ‘ham iskaa (sarkaar kaa) virodh nahin kar rahe hai
 If the government suggests some good steps, we are willing to accept it
 unhen ise kanoon kii jarurat ke hisaab se karnaa hoga
 We are ready to accept good suggestions
 ’nyaaypalika main bhrashtachar ke mudde par unhone kaha, ‘yadi ham rajya ke karypalika or vidhayika jaise anya angon se nyaaypalika kii tulana karte hai to yah na ke baraabar he
 There is a mechanism to deal with complaints against judges
 ’nyaayamurti sadashivam ne kaha ki vah is raay se sahamat nahin hai ki vartmaan mahabhiyog praavdhaan zyaadaatar nyaaypalika ke paksh main hai
 He said, 'it is a difficult task for the judges
 unhen saadhaaran naukariyon ke logon kii tarah nahin hataaya ja saktaa
 They need constitutional protection from trivial complaints and steps
 ’ haalanki, unhone nyapalika ke sadasyon ko ek salaah di
 He said, 'judges should be aware of their constitutional obligations and their responsibilities towards the citizens
 yadi koi aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karata he, to ucch nyaayalay or ucchtam nyaayalay karrwai kar sakate hai

 Union Home Minister p Chidambaram hit back at the non-congress Chief Ministers, saying that Jessica made the film on the scandal, but there was no mention of killing of 21 Dalits in Bihar
 chidambaram sabhi rajyon ke grih mantriyon or saamaajik nyaay mantriyon ke sammelan ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 He said that till now we have not been able to provide all the facilities to the 25 percent population of the country
 chidambaram ne kaha ki mukhyantriyon kii baithak ke baad is baithak kaa aayojan isi ummid ke saath karne kaa nirnay liya gaya ki kuch mukhyamantri is baithak main jarur hissaa lenge
 Expressing happiness, Chidambaram said that he was happy that Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is present here
 chidambaram ne kaha, yah baithak saamaajik nyaay or anya muddon ke liye behad jaruri he kyonki es or asti ko abhi bhi kai mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 He went on to say, 'the problem of untouchability has been eradicated, but over time its definition is also changing
 jo 'harijan' hai, ve mandiron main pravesh se vanchit hai or abhi bhi adhikaron kii raksha ke liye police tak nahin pahunch pate hai
 This embarrassing stain will also cause great anger in your mind
 hamane kai disha-nirdesh jari kiye magar abhi tak unke saamaajik-aarthik utthan ke liye kuch nahin kar paae
 Laws and guidelines are not enough to deal with this untouchability
 jesica laal hatyakand kii charchaa karte hue chidambaram ne kaha, 'jab jesica laal kii maut hui to logon ne candal march nikaala, is par film bhi bani lekin bihar main 21 daliton kii hatya par koi andlon kyon nahin hua? sarkarein har jagah hai or ve chahen to bahut kuch kar sakati hai
 Team India vice-captain Rohit Sharma, who scored a brilliant century against South Africa, has no idea about Dhoni's glove controversy

 com / spw8onnram— BCCI (@bcci)june 8, 2019isisi world-2019 main bharat ke dakshin africa ke khilaaf khele gaye match main dhoni ke gloves par sena kaa chinh bana tha, jise lekar isisi ne aapatti jataai thi or bisisiai se kaha tha ki vah dhoni se apane dastaanon par se yah chinh hataane ko kahe
 The BCCI had sought approval from the ICC to retain Dhoni's mark, which was denied by the ICC
 bisisiai ke siio rahul johari isi mudde par isisi se baat karne ke liye landan ravaanaa ho rahe hai
 Though the Committee of Administrators (COA) chairman Vinod Rai and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) CEO Rahul Johri did not stand with Mahendra Singh Dhoni on the issue related to marking the army on the gloves Are with them
 vinod raay ne is maamle ko lekar kaha he ki agar sena kaa chihn isisi ke niyamon kaa ulanghan he to bisisiai iskaa ulanghan nahin karegaa
 a similar thing was said by Johri, but the players said that they are with their former captain
 captain viraat kohli ne bhi kaha ki dhoni ne sena ke sammaan main yah chihn lagaaya he or isamen koi harj nahin
 Sources privy to the inside of the Indian camp in London told IANS that the players have made it clear that they are with Dhoni and the matter is being scuttled meaninglessly

 ye bahut sunaharaa mauka he ki ham ye loktantr kii foundation majboot karne ke liye ham ek bahut gambhir charchaa karne ke liye baithe hai
 Sir, since 1952, in India, the question arose that how is it possible to implement the election process in such a big country, in a country with such a geographical spread, in a country with such a large topography
 lekin main bahut fakhr ke saath kah saktaa hum ki 1952 se lekar ab tak har chunaav ko chunaav ayog ne na keval sambhav kiya he balki safalataa purvak sambhav karke dikhaaya he
 Many democracies in the world have been ruined because there were flaws in the election process
 isliye main jo yahaan baat rakhane ja rahaa hum yaa ham sab logon ne apni apni baat rakhi he, uskaa matlab pheth main kami nahin he
 As you said in your talk we have to evolve
 evolution kaa process he
 Therefore, what is said here should not be considered to be a reduction in faith or commentary, but rather a contribution given in the process of evolution
 ye isliye jaruri he kyonki abhi kai sawaal uth rahe hai
 Some candidate is saying that there are 19 votes in his family and i got only 2 votes at my booth
 sawaal ye bhi uth rahe hai ki jahaan kisi candidet ne ye sawaal uthaae yaa ricounting kii baat kii to manaa kar diya gaya
 Questions are being raised about many things
 ye sawaal kisi vyakti vishesh ko lekar nahin hai
 No one is on your commission or on our commission
 sawaal processes par he
 Is on the machine used in that process
 main do-teen chijen aapke saamne rakhata hum
 You said, "looking forward to evolve sir, you are looking for further improvement sir, further improvement is only possible when we accept the principle that yes there are certain problems within our systems
 If we keep repeating again and again it's not possible
 
 
 
 ye to asambhav he
 
 ye to ho hi nahin saktaa
 
 
 "then no improvement can happen after this
 further improvement kii sambhavanaayen rah nahin jaatin
 So my Humble submission is what has been shown so far in the presentation
 hamen aisa lagata he ki jab tak aap imposible kehete rahenge, hamaare saamne har baar kehete rahenge
 The scope of our conversation will decrease
 hamaare prashn uthaane ke scope kam hote jaaenge
 And the scopes of farther improvement go absolutely zero
 pregentation main diarective principles kii tarah thi
 Wish was like a list
 ek adarsh chunaav vyavastha kya ho sakati he, uske bare main thi
 Very good
 lekin aapke puure prajentation ko main dekhuun to do pillar par aadhaarit he
 The first is that our EVM is non-tempering
 doosraa hamaara administrative sefguard bahut surakshit he
 It is very good
 donon par bharosa karke aap kah rahe hai ki iviem kii tempring nahin ho sakati
 It has been given many times that no one can read the chip
 agar chip ko programing karne ke baad chip ko koi read nahin kar saktaa to iskaa matlab ham sirf software ko lod karne vaali company ke bharose par ye kah rahe hai ki us company ne- hamane usko software kaa proto tip bataaya, usne wo software banaakar us chip main lod kar diya he
 None of us know what software is in it, we don't know what software is in it
 kyonki uske software ko read nahin kiya ja saktaa, ham admit kar rahe hai
 This means that the Election Commission has trust information, we cannot guarantee that the software it has inserted, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 That the software he uploaded
 doosraa, aapane kaha madraboard, usamen aapane kaha ki first level chekup hota he, or first level chekup ke dauraan ham dekhte hai
 You used a term that if the motherboard was changed, then it would be known during the first level checkup
 sar, main poochna chahta hum, jaankaree ke liye kya first level chekup ke dauraan aapaki company ke engeenior mashin ko khol kar madraboard check karte hai
 Because when your demonstration was happening here
 to unase main categorical ye baat poochi thi ki aap engeenior jab jate hai first lavale chekup karne to kya aap mashin ko andar se khol kar madraboard kii checking tak jate hai yaa nahin? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 agar ham first level chekup par mashin ko us level tak hi nahin kholte hai to, how can we say agar madraboard change hua hoga to hamako pataa chal jaayegaa ki madraboard change kar diya he kisi ne
 This is important, sir, because the possibility of changing the motherboard, i will talk to you when i come on your second prayer
 isamen kuch saathiyon ne sawaal uthaaya tha, main bas un sawaalon ko thodaa sa anderline karke aage ja rahaa hum for the interest of time ki micro controlar koun banaata he? aap technology koun si yuz kar rahe hai? ye sari technology
 
 
 Because there were safegaurd in your technology, we have installed these safegaurd in machines, we have installed these safegaurd in adminstrations
 
 
 
 This presentation does not assure that this technology is non untouchable
 aapako technology main mujhe lagata he technical export ke saath main milakar ek alag se seshan karne chahie
 it should be an open discussion
 jahaan IIT se lekar IIID se lekar achche achche technocrate hamaare desh main hai
 There should be an open discussion sitting with them all
 as a leader, as a voter, i should have faith in this technology
 What is that technology? Your machine becomes two government companies
 ye bhi usamen rahen
 You gave example, some answers about Bhind
 main frankli abhi usamen kuch konvening nahin lag rahaa he
 It has a few loopholes
 main usko bhi discuss karnaa chaahunga
 You discussed that the German court had said this, you referred to the German court, Sir, the reference to the German court is important
 uskaa principal emportent he
 He said 'it is uncostitutional to rely on technology between voters and results'
 voter or rigelt ke bharose ke bich technology par nirbhar karnaa uncostitutional he, sar, ye mashin ko lekar mere kuch objaraveshan the
 i regarding administrative safeguard with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 kyunki wo bhi hamaare bich main se hi hai
 There are boys and girls who come out from among us all
 ham jaanate hai ki sarkari mashinari kya hoti he? aapke paas jo safeguard hai, agar main usko desi bhashaa main kahuun to wo sarkari afasar or sarkari mashinari ke safeguard hai
 And when we have seen the government machinery, how much politically influent and how many financial influencers have happened, we have seen millions of evidences
 not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life main ham dekhte hai ki hamaare polytical mashinari kitni influence rahati he
 Sir, this administration was before EVM, when we, as a country, as a society, as an administration, we had decided that now we will go to EVM voting through manual voting
 tab hamen isi mashinari main khamiyaan dikhti thim
 Rigging takes place, officers come under influence, officers are intimidated, they are blackmailed
 wo influence hokar riging kara dete hai, booth lut tak kara dete hai
 i was a journalist Sir, i have done journalism for eight to ten years
 maine reporting bhi kii he ki kaise booth lut hoti thi
 i have covered a very remote area and used to get involved in looting machinery booths
 kai baar isiilie to ham evm jaisi technology kii taraf aae ki sef rahen
 Depending on the same officer, we can not be guaranteed just by saying that there will be a very good, very good officer sitting somewhere, and if there is an influential officer sitting somewhere
 sar ham jitani baat kar len yahaan par sef gord kii, main aapako bataata hum sar
 Now elections were held in Delhi, you can say that they were not in your domain but there are some realities that will match everywhere
 sar ellection kamishan ke tamaam adeshon ke baavjood ek inspector jaakar, ek esechao ja kar candidet ko kahata he, bhai prachaar karnaa he to zaraa ek AC lagava do, varanaa tumhaare ladakon ko vahaan khadaa nahin hone duungaa jo parche baant rahe the, sar aapke paas shikaayat karenge aapke paas koi saboot bhi nahin aa paayegaa lakin vahaan ham saare log jaanate hai, hamame se adhiktar log jaanate hai ki agar eemaandaaree se chunaav prachaar ke liye do ladke sadak par khadey kiye jaaen or unako chaar ghante ke liye police apni jeep main le ja kar thane main band kar de, to hamaara chunaav prachar to chaupat ho jaataa he
 And the inspector gives him the contract, if not get one attached, then i see how you do the campaign, i see the other soldier come and say, give uniform money, give two good uniform money, have to bring from Connaught Place
 yah uddhran hai, aise uddhran har ward main hamamen se har koi de saktaa he
 Can give you lots of examples
 sar aapane kaha FLC kaa nimantran jaataa he har partiyon ko usamen bhagidaari karen, isliye maine sar isko shabd diya diarective principles kii tarah se hamane bolaa he
 How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 kitne SDM, kitne tehseeldaar vahaan candidats ko leki yaa polytical party ripregentative ko leki welcomming hote hai
 We all know how much discreasing happens, people of every party sitting here know
 sar main teen chizein rakhana chahta hum yahaan par prapojal ke rup main
 We were constantly hearing that there would be hackathons and i think that is a good thing
 haikethon, aaj kii taarikh main shabd aa gaya he, haikethon koi aparaadh nahin he
 Ethical Hackathon is a term arrived
 to ham athical haikethon karaaen, ham bachein na usase
 You said in your address that we will not conduct hackathons, we will challenge
 sar aapkaa jo chalange kaa scope he pehali baat wo haikethon nahin he kyonki yaa to aap hamen jin pichley paanch chunaavon kii baat ham kar rahe hai, (a) aap hamen mashine openali de dijiye, ham usko hack kar ke dikhaa denge aapako
 (b) If you look because you will say this machines cannot be hacked right now because there is a definition of hacking
 hamaare mitra baithe hai, mere saathi saurav bharadwaj
 They hold 9 years of experience in embedded technology
 ejineering ke baad inhone aaj do din pehle dilli vidhansabha main bhi ek mashin kaa prototip hack kar ke dikhaaya
 Sir, about that machine, i can also guarantee that no one can hack it and show it because we know its code, we can hack it, we can temper it so how much tempering is there because the word you Used, i am using it
 aapane kaha pichley chunaavo main tempring hui thi iskaa pruf do
 Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you
 uskaa bhi koi pruf nahin de saktaa
 Someone should liberate him a little, put a Liberal approach in it and go with this positive approach because Mishra Saheb also mentioned, we were saying in Punjab too
 bahut saare aise aria hai jahaan bahut saare logon ne affidavit file kiye hai ki maine vot diya tha, meri party jisko maine vot diya tha usko 10 vot aae hai
 And 20 people have filed affidavits saying that we had voted for this party, sir, where did our vote go, how did only 10 come
 to jahaan jahaan aise controvarsial ishyus aae hai, meraa sabamishan sar ye rahegaa ki is tarah ke booth kii mashiinon ko aap apane pojeshan main len, unako yahaan multi party team banaaen, ek magistrate ko baithaaen or unke saamne un logon bulaaen jin logon ne affidavit diya tha
 My first suggestion is that the EVM Election Commissioners should take possession of the places where the candidates are most suspicious of the results and the candidates who are giving affidavits saying that our votes are more than the results of the votes
 Ask them to bring their voters in front of the candidates of all the participating parties, checking the votes of those voters by matching the time according to the affidavit
 Get it done in the presence of CRET
 agar ve sahi kah rahe hai to jaanch kaa vishay he, or yadi ve galat hai to koi baat nahin, main bhagwaan se prarthana karata hum ki unke daawey galat hon kyonki sirf tabhi hamaara loktantr surakshit he! tabhi ham loktantric vyavastha ke anusaar chal paaenge! i appreciate this order of the Election Commission that you have decided to hold all further elections with VVPAT, which is a commendable step for the development of the country
 lekin isamen ek vishesh baat he jo main suzav ke rup main rakh rahaa hum
 When the Hon'ble Supreme Court said that VVPAT should be used in elections, they did not just ask for the installation of VVPAT machine, VVPAT gives us the opportunity to match the print of the VVPAT if there is a problem in the middle of counting of votes
 But there is no arrangement for counting of print receipts, that printing can be counted only after the order of High Court
 chunaav ayog aisi vyavastha kare ki har vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa yaa chunaav main kam se kam 25 fisadi booth ke vot kii EVM kii ginati kaa milan, VVPAT kii parchi ke saath ho
 That 25 percent of the booths can be selected randomly, or as per the wishes of the candidates
 25 fisadi booth par aap parchi kii ginati ko anivaary kar den, tabhi VVPAT kaa prabhavi prayog ho paayegaa
 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This will also send the message that the electoral process is so transparent that the people have an open challenge that they can challenge it under the rule and get it rectified
 hamen aise technocrate or logon kii prashansa kerani chaiye or unhen shaabaasi deni chaiye jo haikethon main aakar EVM ko temper karke dikhaaen ki usne hamen hamaari kamajori bataayi or ise ham dur karengen, isse loktantr majboot hoga, hamen hekking kii chunauti se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin he, usase bachein nahin
 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke
 Thanks a lot! duniya main kai demokrasi isliye barabaad hoti chali gayi kyonki vahaan kii chunaav prakriya main khamiyaan thim
 So, what i am going to talk about here or we all have kept our point, it does not mean lack of faith
 jaisaa ki aapane apni baat main kaha ki hamen evolve hona he
 Evolution is a process
 isliye yahaan kahi hui baton ko pheth main kami yaa tikaa-tippanee naa mana jaae balki evolution ke process main diya gaya contribution mana jaae
 This is important because many questions are arising right now
 koi candidet kah rahaa he ki uske parivaar main 19 vot hai or mujhe apane booth par keval 2 vot mili hai
 Questions are also arising that where a candidate raised these questions or talked about recounting, it was refused
 bahut sari chizon ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai
 These questions are not about any particular person
 kisi aapke ayog par yaa hamaare ayog par nahin he
 The question is on the process
 us process main istemaal hone vaali mashin par he
 i put two-three things in front of you
 aapane kaha, "looking forward to evolve sar, you are looking for further improvement sar, further improvement is only possible when we in principle accept that yes there are certain problems within our systems
 If we keep repeating again and again it's not possible
 
 
 
 This is impossible
 
 This cannot be done
 
 
 "to phir iske baad koi impruvement ho hi nahin saktaa
 Possibilities of further improvement are no more
 isliye meraa hambal sabamishan he ki ab tak pregentation main jo dikhaa he
 It seems to us that as long as you keep saying Impossible, you will keep saying in front of us every time
 hamaari baatcheet ke scope kam hote jaaenge
 Scope of raising our questions will decrease
 or fardar impruvement ke scope to ekadam jiro hote chale jate hai
 The presentation was like a directive principals
 vish list kii tarah thi
 It was about what an ideal election system could be
 bahut acchhee baat he
 But if i look at your entire presentation, it is based on two pillars
 pehla ye ki hamaari iviem non tempring he
 Secondly our administrative safeguard is very safe
 bahut badhiya he
 By relying on both, you are saying that EVM cannot be tempered
 kai baar di ja chuki he wo ki chip ko koi read nahin kar saktaa
 If no one can read the chip after programming the chip, it means that we are just saying on the trust of the company that loaded the software that that company - we told him the proto type of software, he made that software Is loaded into the chip
 hamamen se kisi ko nahin pataa usamen kya software he, we don't know usamen kya software he
 Because its software cannot be read, we are admitting
 iskaa matlab chunaav ayog ke paas main bharose kii jaankaree he, ham guarantee nahin le sakate ki usne jo software daalaa he, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 ki usne jo software aplod kiya
 Secondly, you said motherboard, in that you said that first level checkup happens , and during first level checkup we see
 aapane ek turm yuz kiya ki agar madraboard change kiya gaya hoga to, wo to first level chekup ke dauraan pataa chal jaayegaa
 Sir, i want to ask, during the first level checkup, for the information of your company's engineers open the machine and check the motherboard
 kyunki jab aapkaa demonstration yahaan ho rahaa tha
 So i used to ask them categorical that when you go to the engineer to do first love check, do you open the machine from inside and go to motherboard checking or not? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 If we do not open the machine up to that level at the first level checkup, how can we say if the motherboard has changed then we will know that the motherboard has changed
 ye isliye jaruri he sar, kyonki madraboard change karne kii posibility main jab aapaki second prere par aauungaa to baat karuunga aapse
 In this, some colleagues had raised the question, i am going to go ahead by just underlining those questions for the interest of time
 What technology are you using? All this technology
 
 
 kyonki aapaki technology main safegaurd the, hamane mashiinon main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai, hamane adminstrations main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai
 
 
 
 this presentation does not assure that this technology is non untouchable
 i think in technology, you should do a separate session together with the technical expert
 it should be an open discussion
 Where there are good technocrats from IIT to IIID in our country
 unsab ke saath main baith kar ek open discshan ho
 as a leader, as a voter, i should have faith in this technology
 wo kya technology he? aapaki mashin sarkaar kii do companiyaan banati hai
 Stay in that too
 aapane bhind ke bare main example, kuch answer die
 i can't seem to find anything convecting into it right now
 usamen kuch lupahole hai
 i would like to discuss that too
 aapane discuss kiya ki germany ke court ne ye kaha tha, germany ke court kaa aapane zikr kiya, sar, germany ke court kaa jo reference he usame wo emportent hai
 Its principal is IMPORTANT
 usne kaha 'voter or rigelt ke bich technology par nirbhar karnaa uncostitutional he' that is the statement
 It is uncostitutional to rely on technology between voter and result confidence, Sir, these were some observations about the machine
 main administrative safeguard ke bare main with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 Because they are also among us
 ham sab logon ke bich main se hi nikal kar aane vaale ladke-ladkiyaan hai
 We know what government machinery is? The safeguard that you have, if i say it in the native language, then they are the safeguard of the government officer and government machinery
 or wo sarkari mashinari kab, kitni politicali influence hoti he or kab kitni financiel influence ho jaati he, iske lakhon evidence ham logon ne dekhen hai
 In not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life, we see how influential our political machinery is
 sar, yahi administration to EVM se pehle tha, jis vakt hamane ek desh ke naate, samaaj ke naate, administration ke naate hamane tay kiya tha ki ab manual voting se EVM kii voting par jaayenge
 At that time, we used to see defects in this machinery
 riging ho jaati he, afasar influence main aa jate hai, afasaron ko daraa diya jaataa he, unako blackmel kar liya jaataa he
 They get into rigging by influencing them, and even rob the booth
 main patrkaar tha sar, aath das saal patrakarita kii he maine
 i have also reported how the booth was robbed
 maine bahut remote aria par bhi ja kar cover kiya he to wo mashinari booth lut main shaamil ho jaati thi
 Many times this is why we came to technology like evm to be safe
 usee afasar ke bharose ham sirf ye kahkar ki vahaan bahut acha, kisi jagah bahut acha afasar baitha hoga, kisi jagah influence afasar bhi baitha hoga to ye garenti nahin ho sakati
 Sir, as much as we can talk about safe guard here, let me tell you sir
 abhi dilli main chunaav hue, aap kah sakate hai ki wo aapke domen main nahin the lekin kuch realitys hai jo har jagah match karengi
 Despite all the orders of the Sir Election Commission, an inspector goes to an SHO and tells the candidate, "brother, if you want to campaign, give me an AC, otherwise your boys will not be allowed to stand there who were distributing leaflets, Sir
" You will complain but you will not have any proof but there are many of us who know, most of us know that if there are two boys standing on the street for honest campaigning Field visit and give them off station can be up to four hours of police in jeeps, we choose Prcr is then destroyed
 or uski theg detaa he inspector ek lagava do nahin to dekhtaa hum kaise campan karte ho, dekhtaa hum doosraa sipaahi aa kar kahata he vardi ke paise de do, do acchhee vardi ke paise de do, kanat place se lani he
 These are quotes, such quotes can be given by every one of us in every ward
 aapako bahut saare udhaaharan de saktaa he
 Sir, you said that flc's invitation goes to all the parties to participate in it, so i gave it the word Sir, we have spoken like directive principals
 efffactiveli jab ham ground par ja kar dekhte he to How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 How many sdms, how many tehsildars are welcoming candidates there or political party representatives
 kitne discoureging hote hai, ye baat ham sab log jaanate he, yahaan baithe hue har party ke log jaanate hai
 Sir, i want to keep three things here as a proposal
 ham log lagaataar sun rahe the ki haikethon hoga or mujhe lagata he ki ye acchhee chiz he
 Hackathon, to date, word has arrived, hackathon is not a crime
 athical haikethon ek shabd aa gaya he
 So let us conduct an ethical hackathon, we should not avoid it
 aapane apane sambodhan main kaha ki ham haikethon nahin karaayenge, ham chalange denge
 Sir, the scope of your challenge is the first thing that is not a hackathon because either you give us the last five elections we are talking about, (a) you give us the machines openly, we will hack it and show it to you
 (b) agar aap kyonki dekhiye aap kahenge abhi is mashiinon ko hack nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki hekking kii ek paribhaasha he
 Our friends are sitting, my partner Sourav Bhardwaj
 ye ambeded technology main 9 saal kaa tajurba rakhte hai
 After engineering, he hacked a prototype of a machine and showed it two days ago in Delhi assembly
 sar us mashin ke bare main, main bhi guarantee le saktaa hum ki usko bhi koi hack karke nahin dikhaa saktaa kyonki ham uskaa code jaanate hai, ham usko hack kar sakate hai, ham temprd kar sakate hai to kitni tempring he usamen kyonki aapane jo shabd istemaal kiya usko istemaal kar rahaa hum
 You said, proof that there was tempering in the last elections
 sar, main aapke saamne apni mashin rakh rahaa hum
 Nobody can give proof of that
 koi to usko thodaa sa libral kare, libral approach usamen rakhen or ye positive approach ke saath chalem kyonki mishra sahab ne bhi zikr kiya, punjab main bhi ham kah rahe the
 There are many areas where a lot of people have filed affidavits that i had voted, my party to whom i voted has got 10 votes
 or 20 log affidavit file karke ye kah rahe hai ki hamane to isi party ko vot diya tha sahab, kahaan gaya hamaara vot, sirf 10 kaise aae
 So wherever such revolutionary issues have come, my submission will be that you take the machines of such booths in your position, make them a multi-party team here, sit a magistrate and call those people who have given affidavits in front of them
 Was
 meraa pehla suzav to ye he ki jin jagahon par pratyaashiyon ko parinaamon main gadabadi kii sabase zyada shankaa he, vahaan kii EVM chunaav ayukta apane kabje main len or aise jo pratyaashee jo affidavit dekar kah rahe hai ki hamaare vot nateezon ke vot se zyada hai, unhen sabhi bhaag lene vaale dalon ke pratyaashiyon ke saamne apane voters ko laane ko kahen, shapath patr ke hisaab se samay kaa milan karke un voters ke vot kii jaanch magistrate kii upasthiti main kara len
 If they are right, then it is a matter of investigation, and if they are wrong, then no matter what, i pray to God that their claims are wrong because only then our democracy is safe! Only then will we be able to run according to the democratic system! main chunaav ayog ke is aadesh kii saraahna karata hoon ki aapane aage ke sabhi chunaav VVPAT ke saath karaane kaa nirnay liya he, jo ki desh ke vikaas ke liye ek saraahneey kadam he
 But there is a special point in this that i am keeping as a suggestion
 mananeey ucchtam nyaayalay ne jab kaha ki chunaavon main VVPAT kaa istemaal ho to unhone sirf VVPAT mashin lagane ko nahin kaha, VVPAT hamen avasar detaa he ki agar voting se matganana ke bich main koi gadabad ho to, uskaa milan VVPAT ke print se milan ho sake lekin us print raseed kii ginati kii vyavastha nahin he, us printig kii ginati sirf ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad ho sakati he
 The Election Commission should arrange such that the EVM count of at least 25 per cent of the booth vote in every assembly or Lok Sabha or election should be matched with the VVPAT slip
 wo 25 fisadi booth kaa chayan random tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he, yaa pratyaashiyon kii icchaanusaar ho saktaa he
 At 25 per cent booth, you make slip count mandatory, only then VVPAT will be used effectively
 nahin to koun kab aapatti daayar karata he, phir court jaataa he, phir faisla aata he, ayukta mahoday ye bahut lambii prakriya he ise hamen saral bananaa hi hoga
 My third and final suggestion is that you also challenge us to prove that EVM tampering has taken place in the last elections but get hackathons done as well, Hackathon is very holy thing, you allow it and you must pay attention to ethical hackathon
 Let the definition of hackathon be that "permission to test machines, information and data in an unauthorized manner"
 If you test EVM machines then the foundation of the country and democracy is This would be extremely useful and profitable
 ye aap sirf rajnatik dalon se hi na karaayen kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki har dal main 9 saal ke anubhav vaala ambeded technology kaa ejeeniyar uplabdh ho, puure desh kii IIT, IIIT, NIT or pratishthit sansthaaon ke bacchon ko bulaayen, tamaam technocrates kaam kar rahe hai hamaare desh main, unhen bulaaen or chunauti den
 Do not look at this hackathon from a negative perspective, do not take it in such a way that someone is challenging the system of the country, look at it from the same perspective as one who travels to Everest, crossing the English Channel takes it as a challenge, This may be the beginning of a change in the country's tradition
 isse ye sandesh bhi jaayegaa kii hamaare yahaan chunavi prakriya itvi paardarshee he ki logon ko khuli chunauti he ki ve niyam ke antargat use chunauti de sakate hai or sudhaar karvaa sakate hai
 We should praise and congratulate such technocrats and people who come to the hackathon and tamper with the EVM to show that it tells us our weakness and we will overcome it, it will strengthen democracy, we do not need to run from the challenge of hacking Do not avoid it
 main ye sabhi suzav party kii taraf se prakriya ke anusaar aapako jamaa kara duungaa
 Another final suggestion is to arrange for cameras at every booth
 abhi CCTV kii vyavastha he lekin sirf chuninda jagahon par he, use badhwaayen kyonki camaron ke badhane se gadabadiyon kii sambhaavnaayen kam hoti jaaengi
 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! Many democracies in the world have been ruined because there were flaws in the election process
 isliye main jo yahaan baat rakhane ja rahaa hum yaa ham sab logon ne apni apni baat rakhi he, uskaa matlab pheth main kami nahin he
 As you said in your talk we have to evolve
 evolution kaa process he
 Therefore, what is said here should not be considered to be a reduction in faith or commentary, but rather a contribution given in the process of evolution
 ye isliye jaruri he kyonki abhi kai sawaal uth rahe hai
 Some candidate is saying that there are 19 votes in his family and i got only 2 votes at my booth
 sawaal ye bhi uth rahe hai ki jahaan kisi candidet ne ye sawaal uthaae yaa ricounting kii baat kii to manaa kar diya gaya
 Questions are being raised about many things
 ye sawaal kisi vyakti vishesh ko lekar nahin hai
 No one is on your commission or on our commission
 sawaal processes par he
 Is on the machine used in that process
 main do-teen chijen aapke saamne rakhata hum
 You said, "looking forward to evolve sir, you are looking for further improvement sir, further improvement is only possible when we accept the principle that yes there are certain problems within our systems
 If we keep repeating again and again it's not possible
 
 
 
 ye to asambhav he
 
 ye to ho hi nahin saktaa
 
 
 "then no improvement can happen after this
 further improvement kii sambhavanaayen rah nahin jaatin
 So my Humble submission is what has been shown so far in the presentation
 hamen aisa lagata he ki jab tak aap imposible kehete rahenge, hamaare saamne har baar kehete rahenge
 The scope of our conversation will decrease
 hamaare prashn uthaane ke scope kam hote jaaenge
 And the scopes of farther improvement go absolutely zero
 pregentation main diarective principles kii tarah thi
 Wish was like a list
 ek adarsh chunaav vyavastha kya ho sakati he, uske bare main thi
 Very good
 lekin aapke puure prajentation ko main dekhuun to do pillar par aadhaarit he
 The first is that our EVM is non-tempering
 doosraa hamaara administrative sefguard bahut surakshit he
 It is very good
 donon par bharosa karke aap kah rahe hai ki iviem kii tempring nahin ho sakati
 It has been given many times that no one can read the chip
 agar chip ko programing karne ke baad chip ko koi read nahin kar saktaa to iskaa matlab ham sirf software ko lod karne vaali company ke bharose par ye kah rahe hai ki us company ne- hamane usko software kaa proto tip bataaya, usne wo software banaakar us chip main lod kar diya he
 None of us know what software is in it, we don't know what software is in it
 kyonki uske software ko read nahin kiya ja saktaa, ham admit kar rahe hai
 This means that the Election Commission has trust information, we cannot guarantee that the software it has inserted, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 That the software he uploaded
 doosraa, aapane kaha madraboard, usamen aapane kaha ki first level chekup hota he, or first level chekup ke dauraan ham dekhte hai
 You used a term that if the motherboard was changed, then it would be known during the first level checkup
 sar, main poochna chahta hum, jaankaree ke liye kya first level chekup ke dauraan aapaki company ke engeenior mashin ko khol kar madraboard check karte hai
 Because when your demonstration was happening here
 to unase main categorical ye baat poochi thi ki aap engeenior jab jate hai first lavale chekup karne to kya aap mashin ko andar se khol kar madraboard kii checking tak jate hai yaa nahin? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 agar ham first level chekup par mashin ko us level tak hi nahin kholte hai to, how can we say agar madraboard change hua hoga to hamako pataa chal jaayegaa ki madraboard change kar diya he kisi ne
 This is important, sir, because the possibility of changing the motherboard, i will talk to you when i come on your second prayer
 isamen kuch saathiyon ne sawaal uthaaya tha, main bas un sawaalon ko thodaa sa anderline karke aage ja rahaa hum for the interest of time ki micro controlar koun banaata he? aap technology koun si yuz kar rahe hai? ye sari technology
 
 
 Because there were safegaurd in your technology, we have installed these safegaurd in machines, we have installed these safegaurd in adminstrations
 
 
 
 This presentation does not assure that this technology is non untouchable
 aapako technology main mujhe lagata he technical export ke saath main milakar ek alag se seshan karne chahie
 it should be an open discussion
 jahaan IIT se lekar IIID se lekar achche achche technocrate hamaare desh main hai
 There should be an open discussion sitting with them all
 as a leader, as a voter, i should have faith in this technology
 What is that technology? Your machine becomes two government companies
 ye bhi usamen rahen
 You gave example, some answers about Bhind
 main frankli abhi usamen kuch konvening nahin lag rahaa he
 It has a few loopholes
 main usko bhi discuss karnaa chaahunga
 You discussed that the German court had said this, you referred to the German court, Sir, the reference to the German court is important
 uskaa principal emportent he
 He said 'it is uncostitutional to rely on technology between voters and results'
 voter or rigelt ke bharose ke bich technology par nirbhar karnaa uncostitutional he, sar, ye mashin ko lekar mere kuch objaraveshan the
 i regarding administrative safeguard with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 kyunki wo bhi hamaare bich main se hi hai
 There are boys and girls who come out from among us all
 ham jaanate hai ki sarkari mashinari kya hoti he? aapke paas jo safeguard hai, agar main usko desi bhashaa main kahuun to wo sarkari afasar or sarkari mashinari ke safeguard hai
 And when we have seen the government machinery, how much politically influent and how many financial influencers have happened, we have seen millions of evidences
 not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life main ham dekhte hai ki hamaare polytical mashinari kitni influence rahati he
 Sir, this administration was before EVM, when we, as a country, as a society, as an administration, we had decided that now we will go to EVM voting through manual voting
 tab hamen isi mashinari main khamiyaan dikhti thim
 Rigging takes place, officers come under influence, officers are intimidated, they are blackmailed
 wo influence hokar riging kara dete hai, booth lut tak kara dete hai
 i was a journalist Sir, i have done journalism for eight to ten years
 maine reporting bhi kii he ki kaise booth lut hoti thi
 i have covered a very remote area and used to get involved in looting machinery booths
 kai baar isiilie to ham evm jaisi technology kii taraf aae ki sef rahen
 Depending on the same officer, we can not be guaranteed just by saying that there will be a very good, very good officer sitting somewhere, and if there is an influential officer sitting somewhere
 sar ham jitani baat kar len yahaan par sef gord kii, main aapako bataata hum sar
 Now elections were held in Delhi, you can say that they were not in your domain but there are some realities that will match everywhere
 sar ellection kamishan ke tamaam adeshon ke baavjood ek inspector jaakar, ek esechao ja kar candidet ko kahata he, bhai prachaar karnaa he to zaraa ek AC lagava do, varanaa tumhaare ladakon ko vahaan khadaa nahin hone duungaa jo parche baant rahe the, sar aapke paas shikaayat karenge aapke paas koi saboot bhi nahin aa paayegaa lakin vahaan ham saare log jaanate hai, hamame se adhiktar log jaanate hai ki agar eemaandaaree se chunaav prachaar ke liye do ladke sadak par khadey kiye jaaen or unako chaar ghante ke liye police apni jeep main le ja kar thane main band kar de, to hamaara chunaav prachar to chaupat ho jaataa he
 And the inspector gives him the contract, if not get one attached, then i see how you do the campaign, i see the other soldier come and say, give uniform money, give two good uniform money, have to bring from Connaught Place
 yah uddhran hai, aise uddhran har ward main hamamen se har koi de saktaa he
 Can give you lots of examples
 sar aapane kaha FLC kaa nimantran jaataa he har partiyon ko usamen bhagidaari karen, isliye maine sar isko shabd diya diarective principles kii tarah se hamane bolaa he
 How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 kitne SDM, kitne tehseeldaar vahaan candidats ko leki yaa polytical party ripregentative ko leki welcomming hote hai
 We all know how much discreasing happens, people of every party sitting here know
 sar main teen chizein rakhana chahta hum yahaan par prapojal ke rup main
 We were constantly hearing that there would be hackathons and i think that is a good thing
 haikethon, aaj kii taarikh main shabd aa gaya he, haikethon koi aparaadh nahin he
 Ethical Hackathon is a term arrived
 to ham athical haikethon karaaen, ham bachein na usase
 You said in your address that we will not conduct hackathons, we will challenge
 sar aapkaa jo chalange kaa scope he pehali baat wo haikethon nahin he kyonki yaa to aap hamen jin pichley paanch chunaavon kii baat ham kar rahe hai, (a) aap hamen mashine openali de dijiye, ham usko hack kar ke dikhaa denge aapako
 (b) If you look because you will say this machines cannot be hacked right now because there is a definition of hacking
 hamaare mitra baithe hai, mere saathi saurav bharadwaj
 They hold 9 years of experience in embedded technology
 ejineering ke baad inhone aaj do din pehle dilli vidhansabha main bhi ek mashin kaa prototip hack kar ke dikhaaya
 Sir, about that machine, i can also guarantee that no one can hack it and show it because we know its code, we can hack it, we can temper it so how much tempering is there because the word you Used, i am using it
 aapane kaha pichley chunaavo main tempring hui thi iskaa pruf do
 Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you
 uskaa bhi koi pruf nahin de saktaa
 Someone should liberate him a little, put a Liberal approach in it and go with this positive approach because Mishra Saheb also mentioned, we were saying in Punjab too
 bahut saare aise aria hai jahaan bahut saare logon ne affidavit file kiye hai ki maine vot diya tha, meri party jisko maine vot diya tha usko 10 vot aae hai
 And 20 people have filed affidavits saying that we had voted for this party, sir, where did our vote go, how did only 10 come
 to jahaan jahaan aise controvarsial ishyus aae hai, meraa sabamishan sar ye rahegaa ki is tarah ke booth kii mashiinon ko aap apane pojeshan main len, unako yahaan multi party team banaaen, ek magistrate ko baithaaen or unke saamne un logon bulaaen jin logon ne affidavit diya tha
 My first suggestion is that the EVM Election Commissioners should take possession of the places where the candidates are most suspicious of the results and the candidates who are giving affidavits saying that our votes are more than the results of the votes
 Ask them to bring their voters in front of the candidates of all the participating parties, checking the votes of those voters by matching the time according to the affidavit
 Get it done in the presence of CRET
 agar ve sahi kah rahe hai to jaanch kaa vishay he, or yadi ve galat hai to koi baat nahin, main bhagwaan se prarthana karata hum ki unke daawey galat hon kyonki sirf tabhi hamaara loktantr surakshit he! tabhi ham loktantric vyavastha ke anusaar chal paaenge! i appreciate this order of the Election Commission that you have decided to hold all further elections with VVPAT, which is a commendable step for the development of the country
 lekin isamen ek vishesh baat he jo main suzav ke rup main rakh rahaa hum
 When the Hon'ble Supreme Court said that VVPAT should be used in elections, they did not just ask for the installation of VVPAT machine, VVPAT gives us the opportunity to match the print of the VVPAT if there is a problem in the middle of counting of votes
 But there is no arrangement for counting of print receipts, that printing can be counted only after the order of High Court
 chunaav ayog aisi vyavastha kare ki har vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa yaa chunaav main kam se kam 25 fisadi booth ke vot kii EVM kii ginati kaa milan, VVPAT kii parchi ke saath ho
 That 25 percent of the booths can be selected randomly, or as per the wishes of the candidates
 25 fisadi booth par aap parchi kii ginati ko anivaary kar den, tabhi VVPAT kaa prabhavi prayog ho paayegaa
 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This will also send the message that the electoral process is so transparent that the people have an open challenge that they can challenge it under the rule and get it rectified
 hamen aise technocrate or logon kii prashansa kerani chaiye or unhen shaabaasi deni chaiye jo haikethon main aakar EVM ko temper karke dikhaaen ki usne hamen hamaari kamajori bataayi or ise ham dur karengen, isse loktantr majboot hoga, hamen hekking kii chunauti se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin he, usase bachein nahin
 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke
 Thanks a lot! aapane kaha, "looking forward to evolve sar, you are looking for further improvement sar, further improvement is only possible when we in principle accept that yes there are certain problems within our systems
 If we keep repeating again and again it's not possible
 
 
 
 This is impossible
 
 This cannot be done
 
 
 "to phir iske baad koi impruvement ho hi nahin saktaa
 Possibilities of further improvement are no more
 isliye meraa hambal sabamishan he ki ab tak pregentation main jo dikhaa he
 It seems to us that as long as you keep saying Impossible, you will keep saying in front of us every time
 hamaari baatcheet ke scope kam hote jaaenge
 Scope of raising our questions will decrease
 or fardar impruvement ke scope to ekadam jiro hote chale jate hai
 The presentation was like a directive principals
 vish list kii tarah thi
 It was about what an ideal election system could be
 bahut acchhee baat he
 But if i look at your entire presentation, it is based on two pillars
 pehla ye ki hamaari iviem non tempring he
 Secondly our administrative safeguard is very safe
 bahut badhiya he
 By relying on both, you are saying that EVM cannot be tempered
 kai baar di ja chuki he wo ki chip ko koi read nahin kar saktaa
 If no one can read the chip after programming the chip, it means that we are just saying on the trust of the company that loaded the software that that company - we told him the proto type of software, he made that software Is loaded into the chip
 hamamen se kisi ko nahin pataa usamen kya software he, we don't know usamen kya software he
 Because its software cannot be read, we are admitting
 iskaa matlab chunaav ayog ke paas main bharose kii jaankaree he, ham guarantee nahin le sakate ki usne jo software daalaa he, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 ki usne jo software aplod kiya
 Second, you said motherboard, in that you said that first level checkup happens, and during first level checkup we see
 aapane ek turm yuz kiya ki agar madraboard change kiya gaya hoga to, wo to first level chekup ke dauraan pataa chal jaayegaa
 Sir, i want to ask, during the first level checkup, for the information of your company's engineers open the machine and check the motherboard
 kyunki jab aapkaa demonstration yahaan ho rahaa tha
 So i used to ask them categorical that when you go to the engineer to do first love check, do you open the machine from inside and go to motherboard checking or not? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 If we do not open the machine up to that level at the first level checkup, how can we say if the motherboard has changed then we will know that the motherboard has changed
 ye isliye jaruri he sar, kyonki madraboard change karne kii posibility main jab aapaki second prere par aauungaa to baat karuunga aapse
 In this, some colleagues had raised the question, i am going to go ahead by just underlining those questions for the interest of time
 What technology are you using? All this technology
 
 
 kyonki aapaki technology main safegaurd the, hamane mashiinon main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai, hamane adminstrations main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai
 
 
 
 this presentation does not assure that this technology is non untouchable
 i think in technology, you should do a separate session together with the technical expert
 it should be an open discussion
 Where there are good technocrats from IIT to IIID in our country
 unsab ke saath main baith kar ek open discshan ho
 as a leader, as a voter, i should have faith in this technology
 wo kya technology he? aapaki mashin sarkaar kii do companiyaan banati hai
 Stay in that too
 aapane bhind ke bare main example, kuch answer die
 i can't seem to find anything convecting into it right now
 usamen kuch lupahole hai
 i would like to discuss that too
 aapane discuss kiya ki germany ke court ne ye kaha tha, germany ke court kaa aapane zikr kiya, sar, germany ke court kaa jo reference he usame wo emportent hai
 Its principal is IMPORTANT
 usne kaha 'voter or rigelt ke bich technology par nirbhar karnaa uncostitutional he' that is the statement
 It is uncostitutional to rely on technology between voter and result confidence, Sir, these were some observations about the machine
 main administrative safeguard ke bare main with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 Because they are also among us
 ham sab logon ke bich main se hi nikal kar aane vaale ladke-ladkiyaan hai
 We know what government machinery is? The safeguard that you have, if i say it in the native language, then they are the safeguard of the government officer and government machinery
 or wo sarkari mashinari kab, kitni politicali influence hoti he or kab kitni financiel influence ho jaati he, iske lakhon evidence ham logon ne dekhen hai
 In not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life, we see how influential our political machinery is
 sar, yahi administration to EVM se pehle tha, jis vakt hamane ek desh ke naate, samaaj ke naate, administration ke naate hamane tay kiya tha ki ab manual voting se EVM kii voting par jaayenge
 At that time, we used to see defects in this machinery
 riging ho jaati he, afasar influence main aa jate hai, afasaron ko daraa diya jaataa he, unako blackmel kar liya jaataa he
 They get into rigging by influencing them, and even rob the booth
 main patrkaar tha sar, aath das saal patrakarita kii he maine
 i have also reported how the booth was robbed
 maine bahut remote aria par bhi ja kar cover kiya he to wo mashinari booth lut main shaamil ho jaati thi
 Many times this is why we came to technology like evm to be safe
 usee afasar ke bharose ham sirf ye kahkar ki vahaan bahut acha, kisi jagah bahut acha afasar baitha hoga, kisi jagah influence afasar bhi baitha hoga to ye garenti nahin ho sakati
 Sir, as much as we can talk about safe guard here, let me tell you sir
 abhi dilli main chunaav hue, aap kah sakate hai ki wo aapke domen main nahin the lekin kuch realitys hai jo har jagah match karengi
 Despite all the orders of the Sir Election Commission, an inspector goes to an SHO and tells the candidate, "brother, if you want to campaign, give me an AC, otherwise your boys will not be allowed to stand there who were distributing leaflets, Sir
" You will complain but you will not have any proof but there are many of us who know, most of us know that if there are two boys standing on the street for honest campaigning Field visit and give them off station can be up to four hours of police in jeeps, we choose Prcr is then destroyed
 or uski theg detaa he inspector ek lagava do nahin to dekhtaa hum kaise campan karte ho, dekhtaa hum doosraa sipaahi aa kar kahata he vardi ke paise de do, do acchhee vardi ke paise de do, kanat place se lani he
 These are quotes, such quotes can be given by every one of us in every ward
 aapako bahut saare udhaaharan de saktaa he
 Sir, you said that flc's invitation goes to all the parties to participate in it, so i gave it the word Sir, we have spoken like directive principals
 efffactiveli jab ham ground par ja kar dekhte he to How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 How many sdms, how many tehsildars are welcoming candidates there or political party representatives
 kitne discoureging hote hai, ye baat ham sab log jaanate he, yahaan baithe hue har party ke log jaanate hai
 Sir, i want to keep three things here as a proposal
 ham log lagaataar sun rahe the ki haikethon hoga or mujhe lagata he ki ye acchhee chiz he
 Hackathon, to date, word has arrived, hackathon is not a crime
 athical haikethon ek shabd aa gaya he
 So let us conduct an ethical hackathon, we should not avoid it
 aapane apane sambodhan main kaha ki ham haikethon nahin karaayenge, ham chalange denge
 Sir, the scope of your challenge is the first thing that is not a hackathon because either you give us the last five elections we are talking about, (a) you give us the machines openly, we will hack it and show it to you
 (b) agar aap kyonki dekhiye aap kahenge abhi is mashiinon ko hack nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki hekking kii ek paribhaasha he
 Our friends are sitting, my partner Sourav Bhardwaj
 ye ambeded technology main 9 saal kaa tajurba rakhte hai
 After engineering, he hacked a prototype of a machine and showed it two days ago in Delhi assembly
 sar us mashin ke bare main, main bhi guarantee le saktaa hum ki usko bhi koi hack karke nahin dikhaa saktaa kyonki ham uskaa code jaanate hai, ham usko hack kar sakate hai, ham temprd kar sakate hai to kitni tempring he usamen kyonki aapane jo shabd istemaal kiya usko istemaal kar rahaa hum
 You said, proof that there was tempering in the last elections
 sar, main aapke saamne apni mashin rakh rahaa hum
 Nobody can give proof of that
 koi to usko thodaa sa libral kare, libral approach usamen rakhen or ye positive approach ke saath chalem kyonki mishra sahab ne bhi zikr kiya, punjab main bhi ham kah rahe the
 There are many areas where a lot of people have filed affidavits that i had voted, my party to whom i voted has got 10 votes
 or 20 log affidavit file karke ye kah rahe hai ki hamane to isi party ko vot diya tha sahab, kahaan gaya hamaara vot, sirf 10 kaise aae
 So wherever such revolutionary issues have come, my submission will be that you take the machines of such booths in your position, make them a multi-party team here, sit a magistrate and call those people who have given affidavits in front of them

 meraa pehla suzav to ye he ki jin jagahon par pratyaashiyon ko parinaamon main gadabadi kii sabase zyada shankaa he, vahaan kii EVM chunaav ayukta apane kabje main len or aise jo pratyaashee jo affidavit dekar kah rahe hai ki hamaare vot nateezon ke vot se zyada hai, unhen sabhi bhaag lene vaale dalon ke pratyaashiyon ke saamne apane voters ko laane ko kahen, shapath patr ke hisaab se samay kaa milan karke un voters ke vot kii jaanch magistrate kii upasthiti main kara len
 If they are right, then it is a matter of investigation, and if they are wrong, then no matter what, i pray to God that their claims are wrong because only then our democracy is safe! Only then will we be able to run according to the democratic system! main chunaav ayog ke is aadesh kii saraahna karata hoon ki aapane aage ke sabhi chunaav VVPAT ke saath karaane kaa nirnay liya he, jo ki desh ke vikaas ke liye ek saraahneey kadam he
 But there is a special point in this that i am keeping as a suggestion
 mananeey ucchtam nyaayalay ne jab kaha ki chunaavon main VVPAT kaa istemaal ho to unhone sirf VVPAT mashin lagane ko nahin kaha, VVPAT hamen avasar detaa he ki agar voting se matganana ke bich main koi gadabad ho to, uskaa milan VVPAT ke print se milan ho sake lekin us print raseed kii ginati kii vyavastha nahin he, us printig kii ginati sirf ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad ho sakati he
 The Election Commission should arrange such that the EVM count of at least 25 per cent of the booth vote in every assembly or Lok Sabha or election should be matched with the VVPAT slip
 wo 25 fisadi booth kaa chayan random tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he, yaa pratyaashiyon kii icchaanusaar ho saktaa he
 At 25 per cent booth, you make slip count mandatory, only then VVPAT will be used effectively
 nahin to koun kab aapatti daayar karata he, phir court jaataa he, phir faisla aata he, ayukta mahoday ye bahut lambii prakriya he ise hamen saral bananaa hi hoga
 My third and final suggestion is that you also challenge us to prove that EVM tampering has taken place in the last elections but get hackathons done as well, Hackathon is very holy thing, you allow it and you must pay attention to ethical hackathon
 Let the definition of hackathon be that "permission to test machines, information and data in an unauthorized manner"
 If you test EVM machines then the foundation of the country and democracy is This would be extremely useful and profitable
 ye aap sirf rajnatik dalon se hi na karaayen kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki har dal main 9 saal ke anubhav vaala ambeded technology kaa ejeeniyar uplabdh ho, puure desh kii IIT, IIIT, NIT or pratishthit sansthaaon ke bacchon ko bulaayen, tamaam technocrates kaam kar rahe hai hamaare desh main, unhen bulaaen or chunauti den
 Do not look at this hackathon from a negative perspective, do not take it in such a way that someone is challenging the system of the country, look at it from the same perspective as one who travels to Everest, crossing the English Channel takes it as a challenge, This may be the beginning of a change in the country's tradition
 isse ye sandesh bhi jaayegaa kii hamaare yahaan chunavi prakriya itvi paardarshee he ki logon ko khuli chunauti he ki ve niyam ke antargat use chunauti de sakate hai or sudhaar karvaa sakate hai
 We should praise and congratulate such technocrats and people who come to the hackathon and tamper with the EVM to show that it tells us our weakness and we will overcome it, it will strengthen democracy, we do not need to run from the challenge of hacking Do not avoid it
 main ye sabhi suzav party kii taraf se prakriya ke anusaar aapako jamaa kara duungaa
 Another final suggestion is to arrange for cameras at every booth
 abhi CCTV kii vyavastha he lekin sirf chuninda jagahon par he, use badhwaayen kyonki camaron ke badhane se gadabadiyon kii sambhaavnaayen kam hoti jaaengi
 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! If no one can read the chip after programming the chip, it means that we are just saying on the trust of the company that loaded the software that that company - we told him the proto type of software, he made that software Is loaded into the chip
 hamamen se kisi ko nahin pataa usamen kya software he, we don't know usamen kya software he
 Because its software cannot be read, we are admitting
 iskaa matlab chunaav ayog ke paas main bharose kii jaankaree he, ham guarantee nahin le sakate ki usne jo software daalaa he, we have seen it or we confirm, we have recheck it
 there is no progress to recheck it
 ki usne jo software aplod kiya
 Second, you said motherboard, in that you said that first level checkup happens, and during first level checkup we see
 aapane ek turm yuz kiya ki agar madraboard change kiya gaya hoga to, wo to first level chekup ke dauraan pataa chal jaayegaa
 Sir, i want to ask, during the first level checkup, for the information of your company's engineers open the machine and check the motherboard
 kyunki jab aapkaa demonstration yahaan ho rahaa tha
 So i used to ask them categorical that when you go to the engineer to do first love check, do you open the machine from inside and go to motherboard checking or not? the answer given to me that time was 'NO'
 'we don't open the machine to that level'
 If we do not open the machine up to that level at the first level checkup, how can we say if the motherboard has changed then we will know that the motherboard has changed
 ye isliye jaruri he sar, kyonki madraboard change karne kii posibility main jab aapaki second prere par aauungaa to baat karuunga aapse
 In this, some colleagues had raised the question, i am going to go ahead by just underlining those questions for the interest of time
 What technology are you using? All this technology
 
 
 kyonki aapaki technology main safegaurd the, hamane mashiinon main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai, hamane adminstrations main ye safegaurd lagaaye hai
 
 
 
 this presentation does not assure that this technology is non untouchable
 i think in technology, you should do a separate session together with the technical expert
 it should be an open discussion
 Where there are good technocrats from IIT to IIID in our country
 unsab ke saath main baith kar ek open discshan ho
 as a leader, as a voter, i should have faith in this technology
 wo kya technology he? aapaki mashin sarkaar kii do companiyaan banati hai
 Stay in that too
 aapane bhind ke bare main example, kuch answer die
 i can't seem to find anything convecting into it right now

 koi to usko thodaa sa libral kare, libral approach usamen rakhen or ye positive approach ke saath chalem kyonki mishra sahab ne bhi zikr kiya, punjab main bhi ham kah rahe the
 There are many areas where a lot of people have filed affidavits that i had voted, my party to whom i voted has got 10 votes
 or 20 log affidavit file karke ye kah rahe hai ki hamane to isi party ko vot diya tha sahab, kahaan gaya hamaara vot, sirf 10 kaise aae
 So wherever such revolutionary issues have come, my submission will be that you take the machines of such booths in your position, make them a multi-party team here, sit a magistrate and call those people who have given affidavits in front of them

 meraa pehla suzav to ye he ki jin jagahon par pratyaashiyon ko parinaamon main gadabadi kii sabase zyada shankaa he, vahaan kii EVM chunaav ayukta apane kabje main len or aise jo pratyaashee jo affidavit dekar kah rahe hai ki hamaare vot nateezon ke vot se zyada hai, unhen sabhi bhaag lene vaale dalon ke pratyaashiyon ke saamne apane voters ko laane ko kahen, shapath patr ke hisaab se samay kaa milan karke un voters ke vot kii jaanch magistrate kii upasthiti main kara len
 If they are right, then it is a matter of investigation, and if they are wrong, then no matter what, i pray to God that their claims are wrong because only then our democracy is safe! Only then will we be able to run according to the democratic system! main chunaav ayog ke is aadesh kii saraahna karata hoon ki aapane aage ke sabhi chunaav VVPAT ke saath karaane kaa nirnay liya he, jo ki desh ke vikaas ke liye ek saraahneey kadam he
 But there is a special point in this that i am keeping as a suggestion
 mananeey ucchtam nyaayalay ne jab kaha ki chunaavon main VVPAT kaa istemaal ho to unhone sirf VVPAT mashin lagane ko nahin kaha, VVPAT hamen avasar detaa he ki agar voting se matganana ke bich main koi gadabad ho to, uskaa milan VVPAT ke print se milan ho sake lekin us print raseed kii ginati kii vyavastha nahin he, us printig kii ginati sirf ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad ho sakati he
 The Election Commission should arrange such that the EVM count of at least 25 per cent of the booth vote in every assembly or Lok Sabha or election should be matched with the VVPAT slip
 wo 25 fisadi booth kaa chayan random tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he, yaa pratyaashiyon kii icchaanusaar ho saktaa he
 At 25 per cent booth, you make slip count mandatory, only then VVPAT will be used effectively
 nahin to koun kab aapatti daayar karata he, phir court jaataa he, phir faisla aata he, ayukta mahoday ye bahut lambii prakriya he ise hamen saral bananaa hi hoga
 My third and final suggestion is that you also challenge us to prove that EVM tampering has taken place in the last elections but get hackathons done as well, Hackathon is very holy thing, you allow it and you must pay attention to ethical hackathon
 Let the definition of hackathon be that "permission to test machines, information and data in an unauthorized manner"
 If you test EVM machines then the foundation of the country and democracy is This would be extremely useful and profitable
 ye aap sirf rajnatik dalon se hi na karaayen kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki har dal main 9 saal ke anubhav vaala ambeded technology kaa ejeeniyar uplabdh ho, puure desh kii IIT, IIIT, NIT or pratishthit sansthaaon ke bacchon ko bulaayen, tamaam technocrates kaam kar rahe hai hamaare desh main, unhen bulaaen or chunauti den
 Do not look at this hackathon from a negative perspective, do not take it in such a way that someone is challenging the system of the country, look at it from the same perspective as one who travels to Everest, crossing the English Channel takes it as a challenge, This may be the beginning of a change in the country's tradition
 isse ye sandesh bhi jaayegaa kii hamaare yahaan chunavi prakriya itvi paardarshee he ki logon ko khuli chunauti he ki ve niyam ke antargat use chunauti de sakate hai or sudhaar karvaa sakate hai
 We should praise and congratulate such technocrats and people who come to the hackathon and tamper with the EVM to show that it tells us our weakness and we will overcome it, it will strengthen democracy, we do not need to run from the challenge of hacking Do not avoid it
 main ye sabhi suzav party kii taraf se prakriya ke anusaar aapako jamaa kara duungaa
 Another final suggestion is to arrange for cameras at every booth
 abhi CCTV kii vyavastha he lekin sirf chuninda jagahon par he, use badhwaayen kyonki camaron ke badhane se gadabadiyon kii sambhaavnaayen kam hoti jaaengi
 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! i regarding administrative safeguard with due respect to the officers working at the ground
 kyunki wo bhi hamaare bich main se hi hai
 There are boys and girls who come out from among us all
 ham jaanate hai ki sarkari mashinari kya hoti he? aapke paas jo safeguard hai, agar main usko desi bhashaa main kahuun to wo sarkari afasar or sarkari mashinari ke safeguard hai
 And when we have seen the government machinery, how much politically influent and how many financial influencers have happened, we have seen millions of evidences
 not only cases of election, but in daily cases, day to day life main ham dekhte hai ki hamaare polytical mashinari kitni influence rahati he
 Sir, this administration was before EVM, when we, as a country, as a society, as an administration, we had decided that now we will go to EVM voting through manual voting
 tab hamen isi mashinari main khamiyaan dikhti thim
 Rigging takes place, officers come under influence, officers are intimidated, they are blackmailed
 wo influence hokar riging kara dete hai, booth lut tak kara dete hai
 i was a journalist Sir, i have done journalism for eight to ten years
 maine reporting bhi kii he ki kaise booth lut hoti thi
 i have covered a very remote area and used to get involved in looting machinery booths
 kai baar isiilie to ham evm jaisi technology kii taraf aae ki sef rahen
 Depending on the same officer, we can not be guaranteed just by saying that there will be a very good, very good officer sitting somewhere, and if there is an influential officer sitting somewhere
 sar ham jitani baat kar len yahaan par sef gord kii, main aapako bataata hum sar
 Now elections were held in Delhi, you can say that they were not in your domain but there are some realities that will match everywhere
 sar ellection kamishan ke tamaam adeshon ke baavjood ek inspector jaakar, ek esechao ja kar candidet ko kahata he, bhai prachaar karnaa he to zaraa ek AC lagava do, varanaa tumhaare ladakon ko vahaan khadaa nahin hone duungaa jo parche baant rahe the, sar aapke paas shikaayat karenge aapke paas koi saboot bhi nahin aa paayegaa lakin vahaan ham saare log jaanate hai, hamame se adhiktar log jaanate hai ki agar eemaandaaree se chunaav prachaar ke liye do ladke sadak par khadey kiye jaaen or unako chaar ghante ke liye police apni jeep main le ja kar thane main band kar de, to hamaara chunaav prachar to chaupat ho jaataa he
 And the inspector gives him the contract, if not get one attached, then i see how you do the campaign, i see the other soldier come and say, give uniform money, give two good uniform money, have to bring from Connaught Place
 yah uddhran hai, aise uddhran har ward main hamamen se har koi de saktaa he
 Can give you lots of examples
 sar aapane kaha FLC kaa nimantran jaataa he har partiyon ko usamen bhagidaari karen, isliye maine sar isko shabd diya diarective principles kii tarah se hamane bolaa he
 How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 kitne SDM, kitne tehseeldaar vahaan candidats ko leki yaa polytical party ripregentative ko leki welcomming hote hai
 We all know how much discreasing happens, people of every party sitting here know
 sar main teen chizein rakhana chahta hum yahaan par prapojal ke rup main
 We were constantly hearing that there would be hackathons and i think that is a good thing
 haikethon, aaj kii taarikh main shabd aa gaya he, haikethon koi aparaadh nahin he
 Ethical Hackathon is a term arrived
 to ham athical haikethon karaaen, ham bachein na usase
 You said in your address that we will not conduct hackathons, we will challenge
 sar aapkaa jo chalange kaa scope he pehali baat wo haikethon nahin he kyonki yaa to aap hamen jin pichley paanch chunaavon kii baat ham kar rahe hai, (a) aap hamen mashine openali de dijiye, ham usko hack kar ke dikhaa denge aapako
 (b) If you look because you will say this machines cannot be hacked right now because there is a definition of hacking
 hamaare mitra baithe hai, mere saathi saurav bharadwaj
 They hold 9 years of experience in embedded technology
 ejineering ke baad inhone aaj do din pehle dilli vidhansabha main bhi ek mashin kaa prototip hack kar ke dikhaaya
 Sir, about that machine, i can also guarantee that no one can hack it and show it because we know its code, we can hack it, we can temper it so how much tempering is there because the word you Used, i am using it
 aapane kaha pichley chunaavo main tempring hui thi iskaa pruf do
 Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you
 uskaa bhi koi pruf nahin de saktaa
 Someone should liberate him a little, put a Liberal approach in it and go with this positive approach because Mishra Saheb also mentioned, we were saying in Punjab too
 bahut saare aise aria hai jahaan bahut saare logon ne affidavit file kiye hai ki maine vot diya tha, meri party jisko maine vot diya tha usko 10 vot aae hai
 And 20 people have filed affidavits saying that we had voted for this party, sir, where did our vote go, how did only 10 come
 to jahaan jahaan aise controvarsial ishyus aae hai, meraa sabamishan sar ye rahegaa ki is tarah ke booth kii mashiinon ko aap apane pojeshan main len, unako yahaan multi party team banaaen, ek magistrate ko baithaaen or unke saamne un logon bulaaen jin logon ne affidavit diya tha
 My first suggestion is that the EVM Election Commissioners should take possession of the places where the candidates are most suspicious of the results and the candidates who are giving affidavits saying that our votes are more than the results of the votes
 Ask them to bring their voters in front of the candidates of all the participating parties, checking the votes of those voters by matching the time according to the affidavit
 Get it done in the presence of CRET
 agar ve sahi kah rahe hai to jaanch kaa vishay he, or yadi ve galat hai to koi baat nahin, main bhagwaan se prarthana karata hum ki unke daawey galat hon kyonki sirf tabhi hamaara loktantr surakshit he! tabhi ham loktantric vyavastha ke anusaar chal paaenge! i appreciate this order of the Election Commission that you have decided to hold all further elections with VVPAT, which is a commendable step for the development of the country
 lekin isamen ek vishesh baat he jo main suzav ke rup main rakh rahaa hum
 When the Hon'ble Supreme Court said that VVPAT should be used in elections, they did not just ask for the installation of VVPAT machine, VVPAT gives us the opportunity to match the print of the VVPAT if there is a problem in the middle of counting of votes
 But there is no arrangement for counting of print receipts, that printing can be counted only after the order of High Court
 chunaav ayog aisi vyavastha kare ki har vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa yaa chunaav main kam se kam 25 fisadi booth ke vot kii EVM kii ginati kaa milan, VVPAT kii parchi ke saath ho
 That 25 percent of the booths can be selected randomly, or as per the wishes of the candidates
 25 fisadi booth par aap parchi kii ginati ko anivaary kar den, tabhi VVPAT kaa prabhavi prayog ho paayegaa
 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This will also send the message that the electoral process is so transparent that the people have an open challenge that they can challenge it under the rule and get it rectified
 hamen aise technocrate or logon kii prashansa kerani chaiye or unhen shaabaasi deni chaiye jo haikethon main aakar EVM ko temper karke dikhaaen ki usne hamen hamaari kamajori bataayi or ise ham dur karengen, isse loktantr majboot hoga, hamen hekking kii chunauti se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin he, usase bachein nahin
 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke
 Thanks a lot! riging ho jaati he, afasar influence main aa jate hai, afasaron ko daraa diya jaataa he, unako blackmel kar liya jaataa he
 They get into rigging by influencing them, and even rob the booth
 main patrkaar tha sar, aath das saal patrakarita kii he maine
 i have also reported how the booth was robbed
 maine bahut remote aria par bhi ja kar cover kiya he to wo mashinari booth lut main shaamil ho jaati thi
 Many times this is why we came to technology like evm to be safe
 usee afasar ke bharose ham sirf ye kahkar ki vahaan bahut acha, kisi jagah bahut acha afasar baitha hoga, kisi jagah influence afasar bhi baitha hoga to ye garenti nahin ho sakati
 Sir, as much as we can talk about safe guard here, let me tell you sir
 abhi dilli main chunaav hue, aap kah sakate hai ki wo aapke domen main nahin the lekin kuch realitys hai jo har jagah match karengi
 Despite all the orders of the Sir Election Commission, an inspector goes to an SHO and tells the candidate, "brother, if you want to campaign, give me an AC, otherwise your boys will not be allowed to stand there who were distributing leaflets, Sir
" You will complain but you will not have any proof but there are many of us who know, most of us know that if there are two boys standing on the street for honest campaigning Field visit and give them off station can be up to four hours of police in jeeps, we choose Prcr is then destroyed
 or uski theg detaa he inspector ek lagava do nahin to dekhtaa hum kaise campan karte ho, dekhtaa hum doosraa sipaahi aa kar kahata he vardi ke paise de do, do acchhee vardi ke paise de do, kanat place se lani he
 These are quotes, such quotes can be given by every one of us in every ward
 aapako bahut saare udhaaharan de saktaa he
 Sir, you said that flc's invitation goes to all the parties to participate in it, so i gave it the word Sir, we have spoken like directive principals
 efffactiveli jab ham ground par ja kar dekhte he to How many officers are actually inviting are always welcoming to the people who are actually willing to participate in this FLC process
 How many sdms, how many tehsildars are welcoming candidates there or political party representatives
 kitne discoureging hote hai, ye baat ham sab log jaanate he, yahaan baithe hue har party ke log jaanate hai
 Sir, i want to keep three things here as a proposal
 ham log lagaataar sun rahe the ki haikethon hoga or mujhe lagata he ki ye acchhee chiz he
 Hackathon, to date, word has arrived, hackathon is not a crime
 athical haikethon ek shabd aa gaya he
 So let us conduct an ethical hackathon, we should not avoid it
 aapane apane sambodhan main kaha ki ham haikethon nahin karaayenge, ham chalange denge
 Sir, the scope of your challenge is the first thing that is not a hackathon because either you give us the last five elections we are talking about, (a) you give us the machines openly, we will hack it and show it to you
 (b) agar aap kyonki dekhiye aap kahenge abhi is mashiinon ko hack nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki hekking kii ek paribhaasha he
 Our friends are sitting, my partner Sourav Bhardwaj
 ye ambeded technology main 9 saal kaa tajurba rakhte hai
 After engineering, he hacked a prototype of a machine and showed it two days ago in Delhi assembly
 sar us mashin ke bare main, main bhi guarantee le saktaa hum ki usko bhi koi hack karke nahin dikhaa saktaa kyonki ham uskaa code jaanate hai, ham usko hack kar sakate hai, ham temprd kar sakate hai to kitni tempring he usamen kyonki aapane jo shabd istemaal kiya usko istemaal kar rahaa hum
 You said, proof that there was tempering in the last elections
 sar, main aapke saamne apni mashin rakh rahaa hum
 Nobody can give proof of that
 koi to usko thodaa sa libral kare, libral approach usamen rakhen or ye positive approach ke saath chalem kyonki mishra sahab ne bhi zikr kiya, punjab main bhi ham kah rahe the

 nahin to koun kab aapatti daayar karata he, phir court jaataa he, phir faisla aata he, ayukta mahoday ye bahut lambii prakriya he ise hamen saral bananaa hi hoga
 My third and final suggestion is that you also challenge us to prove that EVM tampering has taken place in the last elections but get hackathons done as well, Hackathon is very holy thing, you allow it and you must pay attention to ethical hackathon
 Let the definition of hackathon be that "permission to test machines, information and data in an unauthorized manner"
 If you test EVM machines then the foundation of the country and democracy is This would be extremely useful and profitable
 ye aap sirf rajnatik dalon se hi na karaayen kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki har dal main 9 saal ke anubhav vaala ambeded technology kaa ejeeniyar uplabdh ho, puure desh kii IIT, IIIT, NIT or pratishthit sansthaaon ke bacchon ko bulaayen, tamaam technocrates kaam kar rahe hai hamaare desh main, unhen bulaaen or chunauti den
 Do not look at this hackathon from a negative perspective, do not take it in such a way that someone is challenging the system of the country, look at it from the same perspective as one who travels to Everest, crossing the English Channel takes it as a challenge, This may be the beginning of a change in the country's tradition
 isse ye sandesh bhi jaayegaa kii hamaare yahaan chunavi prakriya itvi paardarshee he ki logon ko khuli chunauti he ki ve niyam ke antargat use chunauti de sakate hai or sudhaar karvaa sakate hai
 We should praise and congratulate such technocrats and people who come to the hackathon and tamper with the EVM to show that it tells us our weakness and we will overcome it, it will strengthen democracy, we do not need to run from the challenge of hacking Do not avoid it
 main ye sabhi suzav party kii taraf se prakriya ke anusaar aapako jamaa kara duungaa
 Another final suggestion is to arrange for cameras at every booth
 abhi CCTV kii vyavastha he lekin sirf chuninda jagahon par he, use badhwaayen kyonki camaron ke badhane se gadabadiyon kii sambhaavnaayen kam hoti jaaengi
 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! Sir, the scope of your challenge is the first thing that is not a hackathon because either you give us the last five elections we are talking about, (a) you give us the machines openly, we will hack it and show it to you
 (b) agar aap kyonki dekhiye aap kahenge abhi is mashiinon ko hack nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki hekking kii ek paribhaasha he
 Our friends are sitting, my partner Sourav Bhardwaj
 ye ambeded technology main 9 saal kaa tajurba rakhte hai
 After engineering, he hacked a prototype of a machine and showed it two days ago in Delhi assembly
 sar us mashin ke bare main, main bhi guarantee le saktaa hum ki usko bhi koi hack karke nahin dikhaa saktaa kyonki ham uskaa code jaanate hai, ham usko hack kar sakate hai, ham temprd kar sakate hai to kitni tempring he usamen kyonki aapane jo shabd istemaal kiya usko istemaal kar rahaa hum
 You said, proof that there was tempering in the last elections
 sar, main aapke saamne apni mashin rakh rahaa hum
 Nobody can give proof of that
 koi to usko thodaa sa libral kare, libral approach usamen rakhen or ye positive approach ke saath chalem kyonki mishra sahab ne bhi zikr kiya, punjab main bhi ham kah rahe the
 There are many areas where a lot of people have filed affidavits that i had voted, my party to whom i voted has got 10 votes
 or 20 log affidavit file karke ye kah rahe hai ki hamane to isi party ko vot diya tha sahab, kahaan gaya hamaara vot, sirf 10 kaise aae
 So wherever such revolutionary issues have come, my submission will be that you take the machines of such booths in your position, make them a multi-party team here, sit a magistrate and call those people who have given affidavits in front of them

 meraa pehla suzav to ye he ki jin jagahon par pratyaashiyon ko parinaamon main gadabadi kii sabase zyada shankaa he, vahaan kii EVM chunaav ayukta apane kabje main len or aise jo pratyaashee jo affidavit dekar kah rahe hai ki hamaare vot nateezon ke vot se zyada hai, unhen sabhi bhaag lene vaale dalon ke pratyaashiyon ke saamne apane voters ko laane ko kahen, shapath patr ke hisaab se samay kaa milan karke un voters ke vot kii jaanch magistrate kii upasthiti main kara len
 If they are right, then it is a matter of investigation, and if they are wrong, then no matter what, i pray to God that their claims are wrong because only then our democracy is safe! Only then will we be able to run according to the democratic system! main chunaav ayog ke is aadesh kii saraahna karata hoon ki aapane aage ke sabhi chunaav VVPAT ke saath karaane kaa nirnay liya he, jo ki desh ke vikaas ke liye ek saraahneey kadam he
 But there is a special point in this that i am keeping as a suggestion
 mananeey ucchtam nyaayalay ne jab kaha ki chunaavon main VVPAT kaa istemaal ho to unhone sirf VVPAT mashin lagane ko nahin kaha, VVPAT hamen avasar detaa he ki agar voting se matganana ke bich main koi gadabad ho to, uskaa milan VVPAT ke print se milan ho sake lekin us print raseed kii ginati kii vyavastha nahin he, us printig kii ginati sirf ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke baad ho sakati he
 The Election Commission should arrange such that the EVM count of at least 25 per cent of the booth vote in every assembly or Lok Sabha or election should be matched with the VVPAT slip
 wo 25 fisadi booth kaa chayan random tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he, yaa pratyaashiyon kii icchaanusaar ho saktaa he
 At 25 per cent booth, you make slip count mandatory, only then VVPAT will be used effectively

 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! Sir, about that machine, i can also guarantee that no one can hack it and show it because we know its code, we can hack it, we can temper it so how much tempering is there because the word you Used, i am using it
 aapane kaha pichley chunaavo main tempring hui thi iskaa pruf do
 Sir, i am placing my machine in front of you
 uskaa bhi koi pruf nahin de saktaa
 Someone should liberate him a little, put a Liberal approach in it and go with this positive approach because Mishra Saheb also mentioned, we were saying in Punjab too
 bahut saare aise aria hai jahaan bahut saare logon ne affidavit file kiye hai ki maine vot diya tha, meri party jisko maine vot diya tha usko 10 vot aae hai
 And 20 people have filed affidavits saying that we had voted for this party, sir, where did our vote go, how did only 10 come
 to jahaan jahaan aise controvarsial ishyus aae hai, meraa sabamishan sar ye rahegaa ki is tarah ke booth kii mashiinon ko aap apane pojeshan main len, unako yahaan multi party team banaaen, ek magistrate ko baithaaen or unke saamne un logon bulaaen jin logon ne affidavit diya tha
 My first suggestion is that the EVM Election Commissioners should take possession of the places where the candidates are most suspicious of the results and the candidates who are giving affidavits saying that our votes are more than the results of the votes
 Ask them to bring their voters in front of the candidates of all the participating parties, checking the votes of those voters by matching the time according to the affidavit
 Get it done in the presence of CRET
 agar ve sahi kah rahe hai to jaanch kaa vishay he, or yadi ve galat hai to koi baat nahin, main bhagwaan se prarthana karata hum ki unke daawey galat hon kyonki sirf tabhi hamaara loktantr surakshit he! tabhi ham loktantric vyavastha ke anusaar chal paaenge! i appreciate this order of the Election Commission that you have decided to hold all further elections with VVPAT, which is a commendable step for the development of the country
 lekin isamen ek vishesh baat he jo main suzav ke rup main rakh rahaa hum
 When the Hon'ble Supreme Court said that VVPAT should be used in elections, they did not just ask for the installation of VVPAT machine, VVPAT gives us the opportunity to match the print of the VVPAT if there is a problem in the middle of counting of votes
 But there is no arrangement for counting of print receipts, that printing can be counted only after the order of High Court
 chunaav ayog aisi vyavastha kare ki har vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa yaa chunaav main kam se kam 25 fisadi booth ke vot kii EVM kii ginati kaa milan, VVPAT kii parchi ke saath ho
 That 25 percent of the booths can be selected randomly, or as per the wishes of the candidates
 25 fisadi booth par aap parchi kii ginati ko anivaary kar den, tabhi VVPAT kaa prabhavi prayog ho paayegaa
 Otherwise, who will file an objection, then go to court, then a decision comes, Commissioner Sir, this is a very long process, we have to simplify it
 meraa teesraa or aakhri suzav ye he ki aap hamen ye chunauti bhi den ki ham ye siddh karen ki pichley chunaavon main EVM tempring hui he lekin saath saath haikethon bhi karavaayen, haikethon bahut pavitra cheez he, aap isaki anumati den or athical haikethon par jarur dhyaan den, haikethon kii paribhaasha ye ho ki "mashin, soochna or data ko anaadhikrut tareeke se jaanchane kii anumati" agar aap EVM mashiinon kii jaanch karaate hai to desh or loktantr kii buniyaad ke liye behad upyogi or laabhadaayak hoga
 You should not do this only with political parties because it is not necessary that embedded technology engineer with 9 years of experience is available in every party, call children of iits, iiits, nits and reputed institutions all over the country, all technocrats are working We have been in our country, call and challenge them
 is haikethon ko nakaaratmak najariye se na dekhen, ise is tarah na len ki koi desh kii vyavastha ko chunauti de rahaa he, ise usee najariye se dekhen jaise everest par jane vaala, english channel paar karne vaala use ek chunauti ke rup main letaa he, ye desh kii parampara main badlaav kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 This will also send the message that the electoral process is so transparent that the people have an open challenge that they can challenge it under the rule and get it rectified
 hamen aise technocrate or logon kii prashansa kerani chaiye or unhen shaabaasi deni chaiye jo haikethon main aakar EVM ko temper karke dikhaaen ki usne hamen hamaari kamajori bataayi or ise ham dur karengen, isse loktantr majboot hoga, hamen hekking kii chunauti se bhaagane kii jarurat nahin he, usase bachein nahin
 i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke

 Make the parties' donations from industrialists and everywhere transparent, today a check on the donor of Rs 2000 starts, the Income Tax Department (IT) gets a call, but where did the donation of Rs 200 crore come from? Why is given, no one even knows
 ise hamen 100% paardarshee bananaa hoga, 2 rupee vaale kaa bhi naam ho or 200 karod vaale kaa bhi naam ho, jisase ham bhi inakam tex department se puch sakenge ki 2 rupee vaale par itani jaanch or 200 karod par koi jaanch nahin
 The comments ye hamaare kuch chote chote suzav hai, main khush hum ki aapane hamaare patr par charchaa kii or ye baithak bulaai lekin ek choti si baat or jo mahatvapurn he ki hamen dukh hua ki aapane hamaare patr ke jawaab main aapane likhaa ki "EVM tempring nahin ho sakati or aap EVM par sawaal na uthaayen balki punjab kii haar kaa chintan karen
 "sir, the Election Commission is a very pious organization and when a letter is received in such a language on its behalf, it hurts, regrets, so stop this kind of tradition
 bahut bahut dhanyavad! My third and final suggestion is that you also challenge us to prove that EVM tampering has taken place in the last elections but get hackathons done as well, Hackathon is very holy thing, you allow it and you must pay attention to ethical hackathon
 Let the definition of hackathon be that "permission to test machines, information and data in an unauthorized manner"
 If you test EVM machines then the foundation of the country and democracy is This would be extremely useful and profitable
 ye aap sirf rajnatik dalon se hi na karaayen kyonki ye jaruri nahin he ki har dal main 9 saal ke anubhav vaala ambeded technology kaa ejeeniyar uplabdh ho, puure desh kii IIT, IIIT, NIT or pratishthit sansthaaon ke bacchon ko bulaayen, tamaam technocrates kaam kar rahe hai hamaare desh main, unhen bulaaen or chunauti den
 Do not look at this hackathon from a negative perspective, do not take it in such a way that someone is challenging the system of the country, look at it from the same perspective as one who travels to Everest, crossing the English Channel takes it as a challenge, This may be the beginning of a change in the country's tradition
 isse ye sandesh bhi jaayegaa kii hamaare yahaan chunavi prakriya itvi paardarshee he ki logon ko khuli chunauti he ki ve niyam ke antargat use chunauti de sakate hai or sudhaar karvaa sakate hai
 We should praise and congratulate such technocrats and people who come to the hackathon and tamper with the EVM to show that it tells us our weakness and we will overcome it, it will strengthen democracy, we do not need to run from the challenge of hacking Do not avoid it

 bahut bahut dhanyavad! i will submit all these suggestions on behalf of the party as per the procedure
 ek antim suzav or he ki har booth par camere kii vyavastha karavaayen
 Right now CCTV is available but only in select places, make it grow as the chances of disturbances will be reduced due to increase in cameras
 partiyon ko udyogpatiyon or har jagah se milane vaale chande ko paardarshee banaaen, aaj 2000 rupee chanda dene vaale kii jaanch hone lagati he, iskar vibhaag (IT) kaa phone aa jaataa he, lekin 200 karod rupee kaa chanda kahaan se aayaa, kisne diya? kyon diya, kisi ko pataa bhi nahin chalata
 We have to make it 100% transparent, name of 2 rupees and name of 200 crores also, from which we will also be able to ask the Income Tax Department that there is no such inquiry on 2 rupees and no check on 200 crores
 tippaniyan These are some of our little suggestions, i am happy that you discussed our letter and called this meeting but one small thing and which is important that we are sad that you wrote in response to our letter that "EVM is not tampering And you should not question EVM, but think about the defeat of Punjab
 " mahoday, chunaav ayog ek bahut hi pavitra sanstha he or jab uski taraf se is tarah kii bhashaa main patr miltaa he to dhakka lagata he, afsos hota he, atah is tarah kii parampara ko roke

 Thanks a lot! bahut bahut dhanyavad! Team India may have been eliminated from the World Cup, losing by 18 runs to New Zealand in the semi-finals, but they have also got some positive things in the tournament
 ek vakt main team india ko kamjor gendbaaji ke liye janaa jaataa tha, lekin is world cap main uske gendbaajon ne kai maukey par ballebaajon ke liye raah aasaan kii
 Whether it is bowling first or later, the Indian bowler has met his captain's expectations on every occasion
