 Among Bolshevik leaders, Trotsky was the only one who was not seen as his follower despite being Lenin's main partner
 1903 main roosi saamaajik janavaadee majdoor party jab bolshevikon or menshavikon main vibhajit hui, to trotski ne lenin kaa saath nahin diya
 In the beginning, he condemned Bolshevism by saying that it was not a proletariat but a formula of dictatorship over the proletariat
 us samay unhen shaq tha ki lenin robsprre jaise shadyantrkaari netaa hai jinke kaaran rus kaa samaajawaadee andolan pathbhrasht ho jayega
 At the time Trotsky was of the view that the goal of socialism cannot be achieved by commanding revolution in the hands of a disciplined party of professional revolutionaries doing secret political work
 ve ek adhik loktantric or khule charitra kii party banane ke paksh main the
 In 1905 he emerged as the Soviet leader of St
 Petersburg
 rus kii is pehali soviet ne 1905 kii kranti main pramukh bhoomika kaa nirvaah kiya tha, or trotski ise pramanik loktantr kaa namoona maanate the
 After the revolution failed, the Tsarshi arrested him and sent him to Siberia
 trotski vahaan se bhaag nikle or aglaa dashak unhone europe main bitaayaa
 During this period he remained with the Mensheviks organizationally
 1917 main ve rus laute tab farvari kranti ke kaaran zaarshahi kaa patan ho chukaa tha
 Now he joined the Bolsheviks because he felt that there was a lot of similarity between his and Lenin's ideas
 swayan lenin trotski kii raajnneetik or saidhantik kshamtaaon ke prashansak the
 Trotsky grew in stature in the Bolshevik party
 unhone videshi maamalon ke kamisar ke taur par germanon ke saath shanti- vaarta main bhaag liya
 Trotsky, as a military commissar, played a major role in the formation of the Red Army and led him brilliantly in the Civil War
 in safaltaaon ke kaaran trotski ko lenin ke sambhavit uttaradhikariyon main ek ke rup main dekha jane laga
 Like Lenin, Trotsky had deep faith in the creative abilities of the Russian proletariat
 is vishwaas ke aadhaar main vishwa-poonjeewaad ke adhyayan se nikali unki ek vishesh tarah kii saidhantik samaj thi
 Trotsky was of the view that in order to get rid of its backwardness, no country needs to go through the steps that developed countries have gone through
 in deshon main pichhadepan ke saath-saath agadepan ke lakshan bhi ubharate hai
 Analyzing on the basis of this theory, Trotsky showed that much of Russia is backward and underdeveloped, but it has also been infiltrated by Western influences
 kai jagahon par aarthik utpaadan or sambandhon ke viksit taur-tareeke apanaae jane lage hai
 These moments of industrial development have created a considerable proletariat and a westernized intellectual elite in urban centers
 parinamswaroop raajnneetik pratirodh or sakriyata ke radical rup prachlit ho gayi hai
 Since industrialization is imposed from above, the local capitalist class is weak, but the proletariat is strong
 poonjeewaadi varg loktantric kranti karne se darataa he or apni aakshamata ke kaaran apana aitihaasik daayitv nahin nibhaa paa rahaa he, isliye yah jimmedaari sarvhaara varg ke kandhon par aa gayi he
 Taking the peasants under his leadership, the working class will have to move towards socialism by eradicating feudalism and all its remnants
 trotski ne apane siddhant ko sthaayee kranti qaraar diya
 In 1850, Marx used this position while addressing the General Council of the Communist League
 trotski ke mutabik praaq-poonjeewaadi maansikta vaale kisaan is krantikari prakriya main mazdooron kaa saath bahut dur tak nahin de paayenge
 Their interest will remain till they get the ownership of the land
 kisaanon ke saath banaaya gaya jo morcha kranti ke liye rasta saaf karata he, vahi samaajwaad kii rachana main baadhak sabit hoga
 Therefore, in one country, especially in Russia, the construction of socialism cannot be successful until the revolution takes place in other countries as well
 isliye rus kii kranti ko vishwa-kranti, khaas kar viksit deshon main kranti ke shuruaati charan ke taur par hi dekha janaa chahie
 Interestingly, there seems to be a lot of similarity between these things of Trotsky and many theories propounded by Lenin after World War I
 kuch trotskivaadiyon ne yah aarope bhi lagaaya he ki 1917 kii kranti main lenin dwaara trotski ke hi siddhanton kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 It is another matter that Trotsky himself never said this after accepting Lenin's leadership in 1917
 lenin kii mrityu ke baad stallin ne ek desh main samaajwaad ke nirmaan kii shodhpatr taiyaar kii
 Theorists like Bukharin were also with Stalin in this matter
 par trotski ne chetavanee di ki is siddhanth par amal karne ke nattejey rus ke liye vinaashkari niklenge
 He said that the time has not come for the collectivization of farming
 trotski lenin dwaara sthapit komintern ko soviet videsh niti ke aujaar main simit kar dene ke bhi viruddh the
 He argued that the Soviet Union must follow the path of industrialization and modernization, but these achievements cannot be considered synonymous with socialism
 samaajwaad kaa matlab he, shram kii unchi utpaadakta, uske parinamswaroop behatar jivan-str or apane poonjeewaad ke sarvaadhik viksit roopon jaisaa samaaj
 This can only happen when the proletariat has the reins of the world economy
 trotski kaa kahana tha ki stallin ke tahat jo soviet vyavastha he, use keval sankramanakalin samajha janaa chahie
 At present, it cannot be guaranteed that it will develop into socialism or it will degenerate into some version of capitalism
 trotski maanate the ki rus kii naukarshahi ek naye varg kii shakl leti ja rahi he
 Even though Soviet society has not reached the state of state capitalism, but its condition is like a lesser state of workers
 trotski ke vichaaron kii vishesh baat yah thi ki unamem marxvad ko har samasya kii achook aushadhi ke rup main dekhne kii pravritiyon kaa virodh nihit tha
 Similarly, he was also against pushing various fields of art-literature and knowledge in a particular direction in the name of Marxism
 apane in radical vichaaron ke baavjood ve party kaa bahumat apane paksh main nahin kar sake
 Within the party, he was seen as a leader who could provide charismatic leadership in case of a crisis, but was not interested in dealing with the everyday ups and downs within the party, and his intellectual brilliance i like to be alone
 jab trotski kii ummiido ke mutabik europe main kranti nahin hui, to unhone vishwa-kranti kaa lakshya chhod kar keval ek desh main samaajwaad kaa nirmaan karne main lag jane kii stalineey pariyojna ko iskaa jimmedaar tehraaya
 Trotsky has never believed that the leninist-bolshevik idea of party and politics is at the root of the Stalinist mistakes, which has led to a single state-run state becoming its captive society
 darasal, trotski ne jivan ke tisare daur main nishkasana bhogate hue bhi 1903 se 1914 ke bich kii gayi lenin or bolshevikwaad kii apni kathor aalochanaon ko kabhi nahin doharaaya

 For example, the dialing code for Guam is +1 followed by the area code 671 — not +671 or +1671
 Originally larger countries, such as France, were assigned two-digit codes and small countries, such as Iceland, were assigned three-digit codes; However since the 1980s all new assignments have been three-digit regardless of countries' sizes
 CCITT, the predecessor of the ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector, developed the first formal list of telephone country codes
 This list was included in the 1964 CCITT Blue Book, among other international telecommunication recommendations, which would eventually become ITU-T recommendation E

 An earlier system of country codes for European use was mentioned in the 1960 CCITT Red Book
 Some of these country codes were retained in the CCITT country code assignments and remain in effect

 Uddālaka was one of the greatest philosophers of the Upanishad era
 ye gautam gotreey aruni rishi ke putr the or isiilie 'aaruni' ke naam se vishesh prakhyat hai
 In the Mahabharata, he has been described as a disciple of the sage Dhaumya and an ideal disciple for his singular gurus service
 
 It is generally believed that the Greek Saint Thales was the pioneer of science
 kintu prasiddh itihaaskaar debiprasad chattopadhyaay ne siddh kiya he ki vastav main thels nahin balki uddalak pratham chintak the jinhone gyaan prapti ke liye prayog kii aavashyaktaa kaa pratipaadan kiya tha
 Many students lived in Rishi Dhaumya's ashram
 vah unhen puri tatparta se padhaate, saath hi unki kadi pariksha bhi lete rahete the
 In these exams, different criteria were set and it would be seen how loyal the student was to the learning and master
 ek din musaladhar varsha ho rahi thi
 The Guru told one of his students Aruni, 'son! The water is being drained out due to the breaking of the ridge of the field, so go and tie the weir
 ' aaruni tatkaal uth khadaa hua or khet kii ore chal diya
 The flow of water was fast
 aaruni ne mitti jamaane kii koshish kii par bahaav rukaa nahin
 Seeing no solution, Aruni lay down at that place
 is prakaar usne pani ko roak diya magar bahaav or varsha ke veg se vah behosh ho gaya
 Even after many nights passed, when he did not return, Dhaomya was worried 
 vah khet par use dhundne pahunche
 On seeing it, Aruni stopped the water and lay near the ridge
 dekhte hi guruji bhavvibhor ho gaye
 a detailed discussion of the spiritual ideas of Aruni has been done in a very interesting way in the Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads
 tatvavettaon ke itihaas main aaruni kaa pad yajyavlky ke hi samakaksh mana jaataa he jo inke shishy hone ke atirikt upanishatkaaleen darshanikon main ni:sanshay sarvshereshth maane jate hai
 Regarding psychological facts, Aruni believes that for the main purpose of sleep is 'labor', and in the state of sleep, the organism takes on communion with the soul
 mrityukalin chetana ke vishay main aaruni kaa kathan he ki jab manushya marataa he, tab uski vaakman main antarleen ho jaati he; ananthar man praan main, praan tej main tathaa ant main tej devtaa main antarleen ho jaataa he 
 Yajnavalkya has taken this theory from here and has elaborated it
 tatvagyan ke vishay main aaruni ke siddhant ko ham 'pratyayvaadee' addhait kaa naam de sakate hai, kyonki inaki drushti main advait hi ekmaatr sat tathaa tathy he
 The theory of Aruni is the connotation of metaphysical sentence, which he explained and proved by his son Shvetketu through many entertaining illustrations
 'idan sarv tat satyam sa aatma tatvamasi shwethaketo'-aaruni ke advaitvaad kaa yah mahneey mantra he 
 The basic element is the 'sat' form, not the non-discrete form, because there can be no origin of any kind from discrete
 yah sat apane main se pehle agni ko, peeche jal ko tathaa ant main prithvi ko isi kram se utpann karata he
 This 'trinity' element of the universe is the self-realized principle of Aruni
 vishwa ke prayek dravya main ye teenon tatv vidyaman rahete hai
 All substances are immaterial
 padaarthon apeksha tatwon kii satyata sarvatha maanya he or in tatwon kii apeksha satyatar he vah sat jo inkaa mul kaaran he 
 It is an astral and base microcosm in all systems of the world
 iskaa purna gyaan acharya ke dwaara di gai shiksha ke dwaara or shraddha ke dwaara praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 'acharyavan Purusho Veda' = Only the man who is assigned by the Guru knows the ultimate element; This sermon of Aruni is the cornerstone of gurutva
 aatma vishwa ke prayek padaarth main usee prakaar vyaapt rahata he, jis prakaar us jal ke prayek kan main lavan vyaapt rahata he jisamen vah daalaa jaataa he 
 This spiritual vision of Uddālaka Aruni is a complete reflection of the monotony and comprehensiveness of the soul

 Scientists have presented several theories in this regard
 in siddhanton main nimnlikhit do siddhant apekshaakrit adhik prasiddh hai : gunasutra, yaa chromosome siddhant tathaa hormone siddhant
 According to genetic science, the cells that are found in the body of beings, have some of these compositions which take special types of pigments and stains, these are called chromosomes
 anuvanshik vigyaan main visheshkar yugmakon, yaa ling koshikaon main paae jane vaale chromosomon par hi vichaar kiya jaataa he
 The number of chromosomes in the reproductive cells of different animals is found as follows: praani kaa naam --- chromosomon kii sankhya Cycnic Sponge - 26 hydra --- 30 - 32 Leech of Lumbricus dynasty --- 32 uniyo sip --- 32 Taramine --- 36 zinga machhlee --- 48 Scorpion --- 24 ek machhlee --- 24 Beauphotode --- 24 - 26 kacchapagan --- 56 Magar --- 32 bhed --- 60 Horse --- 60 - 66 bandar --- 48 Human --- 46 netrics --- 40 Kapotvansh or Colamba --- 66 murga --- 18 - 20 Bats --- 24 lipas vansh kaa khargosh --- 28 - 36 Dog --- 50 - 78 lomadee --- 38 Cat --- 66 choupaae --- 38 - 60 Goat --- 60 bhainsa --- 48 - 56 Pigs --- 38 - 40 chimpanji --- 48 Camel --- 70 san 1901-2 main macclang naamak vidvan ne chromosome kaa pataa lagaaya
 He also made some theories, which were later confirmed by scientific research
 is siddhant main yah mana jaataa he ki prayek praani ke kuch vishisht chromosomon kii sankhya par uskaa ling nirbhar karata he
 If the composition of chromosomes is seen by a more powerful microscope, such as an electron microscope, then some very microscopic compositions will be seen in it
 inako jin kaha jaataa he or yah vishwaas kiya jaataa he ki ye hi janak ke anuvanshik gunon ko unki santanon tak pahunchaate hai

 In many beings, x and y determine the sex of male or female
 jab eks vaala shukranu maadaa ke andey se sanyukt hota he, tab yugmanaj ko do eks eks milte hai or vah maadaa banataa he
 But when the y of the sperm is combined with the x of the egg of the female, the zygote receives x y, ie an odd number and is male
 manushyon tathaa anya praaniyon ke nar tathaa maadaa ke chromosomon main jo vibhed paaya jaataa he, vah agle prishth kii sarini main dikhaaya gaya he
