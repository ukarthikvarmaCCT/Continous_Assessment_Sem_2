 chitrakala ek dwivimiya kala he
 An ancient source of painting in India is the Vishnudharmottara Purana
 chitrakala kaa prachaar china, misr, bharat aadi deshon main atyant pracheen kaal se he
 The painting itself went from Greece to Greece, where it made great progress
 isa se 1400 varsh pehle misr desh main chitron kaa acha prachaar tha
 The British Museum in London has old Egyptian paintings up to 3000 years old
 bharatvarsh main bhi atyant pracheen kaal se yah vidha prachlit thi, iske anek pramaan milte hai
 In the Ramayana, descriptions of paintings, painters and chitrashalas have come up
 vishwakarmee shilpashaastra main likhaa he ki sthaapak, takshak, shilpi aadi main se shilpi ko hi chitra bananaa chahie
 Some of the ancient Indian painters were very skilled in depicting natural scenes, some of the feeling of the Uttararamcharit of Bhavabhuti, in which Sita is surprised to see the images of exile brought before her
 yadhyapi aajkal koi granth chitrakala par nahin miltaa he, tathaapi pracheen kaal main aise granth avashya the
 The poet Domodar Gupta of the assembly of King Jayaditya of Kashmir has written a treatise called 'chitrasutra' of Chitravidya in his treatise called Kuttanimat 1100 years ago
 ajanta gupha ke chitron main pracheen bharatvasiyon kii chitranipunata dekh chakit rah janaa padataa he
 These paintings have been praised by big scientific Europeans
 un gufaaon main chitron kaa bananaa isa se do sau varsh purv se aarambh hua ta aurak aathvin shatabdi tak kuch na kuch guphaayen nai khudati raheen
 Therefore, these pictures are definitely a proof of two and a half thousand years
 chitravidya seekhney ke liye pehle prayek prakaar kii sidhi tedi, vakr aadi rekhaayen khinchne kaa abhyaas karnaa chahie
 After this, the gross structures of the objects should be made by lines only
 is vidya main duuri aadi ke siddhant kaa puraa anushilan kiye bina nipunata nahin praapt ho sakati
 The marking of the extension below or parallel to the vision is easy, but it is a difficult subject to mark the far extension in front of the eyes
 is prakaar kii duuri kaa vistaar pradarshit karne kii kriya ko 'persepective' kehete hai
 The views of a city on a far-off road, a river in front, etc
, cannot be shown without knowing its principles
 kis prakaar nikat ke padaarth bade or saaf dikhaai padate hai or dur ke padaarth kramshah chote or dhundle hote jate hai, ye sab baaten ankit kerani padati hai
 Take, for example, a frame frame placed at a distance
 maan lijie ki aap use ek aise kinare se dekh rahe hai jahaan se uske do parshv yaa teen kone dikhaai padate hai
 Now for the purpose of drawing a picture, we will see with a pencil parallel to the eyes and pressing one eye, the vertical angle closest to all of the box will be seen; The side which will be more in front, the angle on the other side will be smaller than that and the side which will be less visible, the angle on the other side of it will appear the smallest
 arthath nearesth kone rekha se laga hua us parshv kaa kone jo kam dikhaai detaa he, adhik dikhaai padanevaale parshv ke kone se chota hoga
 The second principle is of light and shadow, without which life cannot come
 padaarth kaa jo ansh nikat or saamne rahegaa vah khulata or spasht hoga; or jo dur yaa bagal main padegaa, vah spasht ore kalimaa liye hoga
 The elevation and depth of the substances are also shown according to the rules of this light and shade
 jo ansh uthaa yaa ubhara hoga, vah adhik khulata hoga or jo dhansa yaa gaharaa hoga vah kuch syaahi liye hoga
 Because of not knowing these principles, the market painters who make paintings on glass, etc
, seem to know the game
 chitron main rang ek prakaar kii kunchi se bharaa jaataa he jise chitrakaar kalam kehete hai
 Earlier there was a pen made of hair of a squirrel's tail

 0 2030 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 2030 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of Jesus' birth
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2030 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 saanchaa:backstreet Boys ke kalakaar]] ke kalakaar]] / ATV sangeet prakaashan kalakaar]] The Darian calendar is a proposed system for calculating time in the event of human settling on Mars
 yah 1985 main vayuantariksh abhiyantaa or raajnneetik vaigyanik thomas gaangale dwaara banaai gai or namit kii gai
 The calendar is constructed from which the basic time period is slightly different from the Martian solar day and the tropical year, which are the Martian spring equinox year,
 35
244 seconds is now 39 minutes compared to terrestrial solar day and the Martian Spring Equinox year is 668
5907 SOLS in length

 ke purv ajeeb main yaa phir 10 se samaan rup se vibhajya hai, das saal prati 6686 SOLS utpaadan 
 Walking after the Darian calendar made the year 100 divisible by the common year, but 500 migration years divisible by the leap year
 This results in an error of only about one sol per 12,000 Martians per year

 There are 28 SOLS in the first 5 months in each quarter
 yah apane antim pa ke rup main chalaang pa hota he jab yah ek lip varsh kaa antim maheenaa he, jab tak antim maah keval 27 SOLS he
 The calendar maintains a seven-week week, but the week begins with its first form at the beginning of each month
 ek maah 27 SOLS he, to is saptaah ke antim pa lop ho jaati he
 This is partly for cleanliness
 yah bhi 28 prithvi din 27 +1 / 4 kaa nivasee SOLS ke baraabar he ki yaad kiya janaa chahie, haalanki, sthaliy saptaah kii ausat lambaai ke kareeb mangal grah kaa nivasee saptaah kii ausat lambaai banane ke rup main yuktisangat nahin he or 27 5 / kiya ja saktaa he 6 mangal grah kaa nivasee SOLS

 Mars currently has an axial inclination similar to Earth, so that the greater fad of Mars' orbit about the Sun compared with Earth means that their significance is strongly reflected and hidden in the southern hemisphere, although Mars Residents of the weather, are evident in the northern hemisphere
 The most sophisticated calculations of the Darian calendar extend to the point of making allowance for a slight increase in the length of the Martian Spring Equinox year over several thousand years
 These write a more complex intercalation formula

 Every tenth year is added that is p epagomenal, thus the two-year rotation of the week-long SOLS is not interrupted
 Martiana yojana chah SOLS ko saptaah main prati varsh teen se chaar guna chota karne ke liye darian calendar kii jarurat se bachaa jaataa he
 The loss results in a two-year cycle for SOLS matching of plan, week and month while the Darian calendar is repeatable from month to month

 manu sharma ne police ko ek bayaan diya, jisame usne jesica laal ko goli maarna sweekaar kiya, is bayaan ko tepe kiya gaya tha
 "at that time, the idea of a challenge was shot

" is audio tepe ko praapt karke tivi channel enditivi par prasaarit kiya gaya, lekin yah gavaahi kanoonee rup se prabhavi nahin thi
 Later, however, he retracted from the confessional statement and pleaded not guilty, which was filed in the case
 manu sharma haryana rajya ke pramukh netaaon main se ek kaa vinod sharma kaa betaa he, jo congress party se jude hai
 Previously a minister in the national cabinet, Vinod Sharma was a minister in the Haryana government during the declaration of the case

 Four witnesses who were initially saying that they had witnessed the killing eventually retracted

 This further weakened the prosecution's case

 An aspiring model and acquaintance of Jessica Lal, Shayan Munshi was handling the back of the bar with Jessica at the time the shot was fired

 is gavaahi ko police dwaara apni pratham soochna report ) main darj kiya gaya he, jo shayan dwaara hastakshrit he
 However, during the hearing, he claimed that he did not know Hindi, he did not know who he signed
 sunwaayee main, shayan ne kaha ki manu sharma ne keval ek baar goli chalaai thi or wo bhi hawa main
 usne manu ke kapadey dhyaan purvak bataaye
 baad main, usne kaha ki ek or goli, kisi or ke dwaara chalaai gayi, jo jesica ko lagi

 isane "do bandook siddhant" ko janm diya- jiskaa saath forencik report ne diya jisame kaha gaya tha ki goliyaan vibhinn hathiyaaron se chali thi

 In his 179-page judgment, Additional Sessions Judge SL Bhayana said that the police tried to 'present evidence' and 'fabricate' false evidence against Sharma
 faisla baar baar sanket karata he ki abhiyojan paksh shuru se hi jhuthe gavaah laane or saboot gadhane kii koshish kar rahaa he, taaki maamla bachaav ke lihaaj se kathin hota jaae

 "read the verdict
 faisle main police ko is baat ke liye galat bataaya ki bajaay iske ki saboot kii sahaayta se kaatilon tak pahucha jaye, pehle usne abhiyukt tay kar liye or phir unke khilaaf saboot ikattha kiye
 kyonki abhiyojan paksh andeh se pare aparaadh kii sthapana main vifal rahaa he, sabhi nau abhiyukt bari ho gaye
 After the verdict, many experts pointed fingers at the flaws of the Indian Evidence Act 1872, especially its section 25-29: 25
 a statement given to a police officer will not be considered a provable statement
 a statement given to a police officer will not be proved against the accused person
 26
 The statement given by the accused while in police custody will not be proved against him
 The statement made by any person in the custody of the police officer, unless it is given in the presence of a magistrate, against that person Proven statement will not be considered
 However, initially these clauses were created to protect the defendants so that no statement is made due to the torture of the police, this has also been misused by many guilty defendants later and the same happened in this case where many witnesses Took back his testimony given to the police during interrogation

 In this revelation, Vinod Sharma's name came up prominently for the payment of lakhs of rupees to the witnesses
 kendriya congressi netaaon ke dabaav ke kaaran, vinod sharma ko haryana mantrimandal se istipha de diya
 On 15 December 2006, a 61-page judgment by the High Court bench of Justice RS Sodhi and Justice PK Bhasin held Manu Sharma guilty on the basis of extant evidence
 nirnay ne kaha ki nichali adaalat binaa ramani or deepak bhojawaani jaise gavaahon kii gavaahi par dhyaan nahin dekar dheelaapan darshaya he: "gyanvaan jaj ko puure sammaan ke saath, ham is bindu par dhyaan dilaanaa chaahate hai ki gavaahon kii vishwasaneeyata kaa pareekshan karne kaa ye tarikashayad hi saboot ke moolyankan kaa ek niyam maatr he
 

 Clearly, it reflects a mistake in the use of the brain and also a hasty approach towards a specific end, such as conviction
 " In particular, key witness Shayan Munshi was severely criticized and may face criminal proceedings
 uski apni hi exiaar ko palatney ke bare main faisla bataata he:" ab daawa kar rahaa he ki ukt kathan hindi main darj kiya gaya tha, jabaki usne angreji main puri kahani bataayi thi kyoki wo hindi nahin janatatha

 According to a widely reported media report, after the trial, Manu Sharma told one of his friends in Hindi: That was my fate, this was the fate of fate
 media main manu ke doshi sabit hone par vyapak utsav kaa maahaul tha, jahaan ise is baat ke saboot ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha ki logon kii aawaaj nyaay kaa pahiyaa chalaa sakati he
 Looking at the past records of such cases in India, it was felt that the fixing of the blame in the Jessica Lal and Priyadarshini Mattoo case is an indication of how even the most powerful were not above the law

 Some media reports also claimed that he had to perform rituals after his grandmother's death
 lekin, ve puri tarah jhooth sabit hue kyonki sharma kii daadi kii mrityu 2008 main ho gayi thi
 This parole was further extended for the next 30 days

 On 10 November 2009, due to media uproar, the Delhi government decided to consider whether to revoke parole due to criticism for granting parole and without proper investigation of the reasons stated by the convict
 Go, because Sharma went to a night club in Delhi over the weekend
 lekin manu sharma ne agle hi din, apane parole ke samaapt hone ke do saptaah ke pehle hi tihaad jail main aatmasamarpan kar diya
 The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision in the murder of Jessica Lal
 The main accused Manu Sharma challenged the life imprisonment awarded by the Delhi High Court on 19 April 2010
 19 april 2010 ko ucchtam nyaayalay dwaara doshi ko aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa ke liye manjuuri de di gayi
 The two-judge bench upheld the Delhi High Court's decision that, "prosecution has proved Manu Sharma's presence at the crime scene beyond reasonable doubt"
 Senior advocate Ram Jethmalani, appearing in the Supreme Court for Manu Sharma alias Siddharth Vashistha, attacked the High Court's decision, saying that it had sidelined the lower court's decision to absolve the convict
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki ucch nyaayalay kii khandpeeth ne sharma ko doshi bataane kaa apana man bana liya tha
 Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam said that there was enough evidence against Manu Sharma for his involvement in the crime
