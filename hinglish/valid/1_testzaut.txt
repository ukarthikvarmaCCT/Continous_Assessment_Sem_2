 The Maldives interest is related to its identity as a small island state, particularly in relation to matters of economic development and environmental protection, and a desire to forge closer ties with France, which is a main actor in the field of the IOC 
 The Maldives is a founding member of the South Asian Assembly and SAARC of Regional Cooperation and joined the Commonwealth in 1982 as a former protectorate of Great Britain, some 17 years after gaining independence from Great Britain

 sandhi kaa samaapan kai prakaar se ho saktaa he
 Often it depends on the nature of the treaty
 nishchit avadhi samaapt ho jane ke kaaran, sandhi ke niyamon kii purti ho jane par, athwa mul pakshon main se ek desh kii vinshti ke kaaran, yaa kisi naveen sandhiyojna dwaara jo purvasthit sandhi ko spasht rup se avakramit karti ho, - in sabhi avasthaaon main swabhaavat: sandhi kaa samaapan ho jaataa he
 a substantial change in the situation can also lead to invalidation of the treaty, but it is not clear whether such invalidation can be proved only by one party's opinion
 yuddh kii ghoshnaa hote hi swabhaavat: yudhyamaan deshon kii parsparik samast raajnneetik sandhiyon kaa samaapan ho jaataa he, anya sab prakaar kii sandhiyon kii kriyaatmakataa yudhkaal ke liye sthagit kar di jaati he tathaa ve samjhaute maanya rah jate hai jo visheshtya yudhkalin vyavhaar se sambandhit hon
 Apart from this, any treaty can also be concluded by mutual consent of the authorities
 koi ek paksh bhi anya pakshon ko suchit kar sandhi anubandhan se vilag ho saktaa he, is sthiti main keval us paksh kii ore se sandhi samaapan hota he, kintu is prakaar kaa samaapan turant hi karyanvit nahin ho jaataa
 The other parties receive a certain period of time after the timely notice in which it can settle the balance between the divisive parties, otherwise such a sudden change must confuse and unbalance the premeditated behaviors of the parties concerned
 yah spasht he ki vartmaan antarrashtriya samaaj itnaa gatiman he ki usamen raajnneetik sandhiyaan kabhi satatmaanya yaa aparivartansheel nahin ho saktin
 State units in the Vishwakuntumba have such a nature that their partisan positions constantly change with the view of mutual benefit loss
 aise parivartansheel samaaj main satatmaanya samjhaute kaise sambhav ho sakate hai? isaki cheshtaa maatr raajnneetik vastusthiti tathaa sandhiniyamon main sadaa sangharsh utpann karegi
 Therefore, timely amendment of all the treaties is absolutely necessary, which will always create conflict in the changed political conditions and treaties
 atev samast sandhiyojanaon kaa samayik sanshodhan nitant aavashyak he jisase parivartit raajnneetik dashaon or sandhiniyamon main santulan bana rahe ore koi paksh avaidh rup se inkaa samaapan athwa ulanghan na kare
 This approach is targeted and often given permission and system to amend the projects
 adhiktar samast sandhikaron kii sahmati se sanshodhan kiye jane kii pratha he, kintu 1945 i
 se ek naveen pranali aarambh hui he jise anusaar yadi sanshodhan antarrashtriya samaaj ke hit main ho to sarvasammati nahin, keval pakshon ke bahumat se bhi sanshodhan kriyaatmak ho saktaa he
 It is not an exaggeration to say that the present treaties have created a kind of legal discipline by presenting a peaceful balance in many opposing interests of the international arena
 sandhiniyamon dwaara anek antarrashtriya vivaadon kaa spashtikaran or samaadhaan hua he, tathaa vishwa ke samast rajyon kii suraksha kuch seemaa tak surakshit ho gai he
 Till the dream of the International Legislative Council is realized in the world society, it is inevitable and sure that the international relations should be maintained by the treaty

 Flora's mother was a Christian and her father a Muslim

 His elder brother tried very unsuccessfully to convert him to Islam and then finally surrendered to the authorities

 maaria ne apni maan ko bachapan main hi kho diya, uske pita ne use cotekula ke convent main bhej diya
 The convent's penetrator, Artemia, told Maria how she had witnessed the death penalty of her two sons by Muslim rulers over the past 30 years

 Maria's older brother, Valabansas, also received religious education at the monastery of St
 Felix
 jab maaria ko convent or valabansas ko math bheja gaya tha tab ve bichad gaye the
 They met back when Valabansas was appointed as an observer at the convent of Maria
 valabansas ko 16 july 851 ko muslim adhikariyon ne maar daalaa
 The story of Artemia, along with her martyrdom, inspired Maria to follow in her brother's footsteps

 unhone islamic nayadhish ke samaksh aisa kiya bhi or unhen kaid kar liya gaya
 In prison, Flora was offered a full apology if she accepted Islam
 But Flora preferred to remain a Christian
 His choice was not accepted because according to Islamic law, a Muslim mother or father's children have to accept Islam as their religion
 Sabigotho often went to meet Flora and Maria in prison, even spending a night with them
 She not only wanted to console the two soldiers, but also strengthened their desire to die
 sharia kanoon ke anusaar, floor or mariya ko do alag-alag aparaadhon kaa doshi paaya gaya

 Before hanging, these young women were threatened that they would be "thrown on the road as prostitutes"
 It was an unbearable punishment for a virgin
 He was sentenced to death on 24 July 851

 Some bunkers used this fake brocade

 The development of Chhandas in folk language through Apabhranshi in Sanskrit is not a phenomenon, it has been the need of the hour
 chandas, praakrit sanskrit or apbhransh ke samikarnon par anek vichaar die gaye hai
 Apabhramsa is used as a language in the sixth century
 12veen shatabdi tak vah saahitiyik bhashaa si rahi he par janapadiya boliyon se yah bhi mukt nahin maani gayi he
 The development of the new Indian Aryan language has been attributed to the mid-country Shaurseni and was considered a condition of disobedience while taking the developmental form of apabhramsa
 avah kaa prayog sabase pehle apbhransh ke liye hua he
 Many Jain compositions, Buddhist compositions, compositions of Nath cults, etc
 have come in front
 sidhon ne jis bhashaa kaa prayog kiya he vah lok bhashaa adhik he
 The initial name of Hindi is said to be the language
 bhashaa ke swarup main anek parivartan evam samrudhiyaan aayin
 The oral tradition also created poetry
 yah lok kavy tak hi simit rahaa he
 There is a glut of narrative poems in written poems
 inamen pramukh kriti vishnudaas likhit ramayana katha, mahabharat katha, rukmini mangal, swargarohan katha aadi aisi kritiyaan he, jinase bhashaa kavy kii parampara par prakaash padataa he
 The work presented in the early phase of language poetry is often free from the influences of localism
 isliye kisi bhi boli se praarambhik rup se mail khaati, vyapak bhashaa kaa swarup prastut karti he
 The characteristic of the epic tradition of the Alhakhand is Bundeli's own

 aalha pawada vadin gaaiye, ja din jhadi lage din raat
 
 aalha bhale hi maukhik parampara se aayaa he, par bundeli bhoomi samskruti or boli kaa pratham mahakavy he, jaganic iske rachayita he
 The best epic of Bundeli dialect in language poetry should be accepted
 bundeli boli or uske sahitya kaa samrudh itihaas he or bhashaa kavykaal main uski koi bhi likhit kriti uplabdh nahin he
 There is a distinction between poetry and poetry management, in which everything of the law of the epic is there, but the story is smooth, without any serious deep life philosophy
 bundelkhand main jaganic ke baad vishnudaas hi aise kavi hai jinhone 14veen shatee main do katha kavy mahabharat katha or ramayana katha likhi

 The coordinated form of ritual and devotion is the prototype in Keshav poetry
 ritivaadee kavi ne kavipriya, rasikapriya main reeti tatv tathaa vigyaan gita evam ramachandrika main bhakthi tatv ko pratyaksh evam apratyaksh rup main prastut kiya he

 In a sense, round-the-clock development of society has taken place in this period
 laal or chhatrasaal jahaan hindutv or swadhin bundelkhand kaa samarthan karte hai tathaa pruthak astitv banaate hai
 Akshar supports Nirguna poetry in the field of exclusive devotion and worship like Kabir

 "lal 'is more important in this period because he has portrayed all the events that made Chhatrasal a hero, and Lal's lines have been taken by the erstwhile kings as religious

 kadachit padmakar ke dwaara hi shringaar kaa pishtapeshan bhi bahut ho chukaa tha, atah ve rachanaayen adhik sundar ban padin jinamein lok jivan rahaa he
 That is why phag literature or fiction has become more attractive
