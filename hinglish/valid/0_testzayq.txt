 In elementary algebra, the expression of many terms related to money and minus signs is called polynomial, viz
 padon kii sankhya ke anusaar iske vishisht upnaam 'ekapad', 'dwipad', aadi hote hai
 In higher mathematics, polynomial is typically used for expressions whose terms have zero or plus integer powers of any one variable amount, or more than one variable, in ascending or descending order, such as vyanjak kaa bahupad he or x, y z, kaa tathaa usamen achar he
 If, instead of assuming another expression everywhere, log x is placed, the new expression will be called the expression of log x
 padon ke ghaaton main se mahattam ko bahupad kaa ghaat kehete hai
 If there is more than one variable, then the sum of the sum of the powers of the variables in different terms is called the power of the polynomial
 is prakaar bahupad kaa ghaat 4 he or kaa 7
 It is also said that the polynomial has the sixth power and the second power
 do bahupadon kaa yogafal, antar or gunanfal bahupad hi hota he, kintu unka bhagfal bahupad nahin hota
 The quotient function is the quotient of two polynomials, which may contain only one number
 char main ghaat kaa vyapak bahupad yah he : a fundamental theorem of algebra is that if f is a polynomial of power m in the variable sum x, then the polynomial equation f = 0 always has m root
 ye mul sanmishra bhi ho sakate hai or sampati bhi
 If f = 0 has a root p1, then the part of the polynomial f is completely gone, and a polynomial f1 with the power m-1 is found in the quotient
 ab bahupad sameekaran f1 = 0 ke m-1 mul honge or yadi iskaa ek mul he, to phir f1 main kaa bhaag puraa chalaa jayega
 It is an important theorem that the factorization of f is unique
 yadi ham f ke gunankon or gunankhandon main prayukt sankhyaon par yah pratibandh laga den ki ve kisi amuk kshetra kii hongi, to mulon kaa astitv avashyambhavi nahin rahata
 It is important that if the factorization of polynomial can be done, the factors will be unique
 trikonmiti kaa ek mahatvapurn prameya yah he ki yadi m koi dhanatmak purnank he, to kojya mx kii abhivyakti kojya x ke m ghaatvale bahupad ke rup main kii ja sakati he, yatha The theorem about sine mx is that if m is odd then the expression of sine mx can be expressed as a polynomial of m th power of sine x and if m is even then the expression of sine mx / cosine x is m of sine x - 1 will be in the form of polynomial of power, such as vaishleshik gyomiti main vakron kaa adhyayan unhen do charon ke bahupad sameekaran dwaara nirupit kar kiya jaataa he
 Similarly, three variable polynomial equations are used to study the planes
 swecch ghaat ke bahupad samikarnon se nirupit vakron or talon kaa adhyayan bijiy jyamiti main kiya jaataa he
 a polynomial of two or more variables with the sum of the powers of the variables in each term is called the quadratic polynomial, or simply the quadratic; In modern algebra, the conversion of these equations and the principles of inductance and coherence related to these transformations have a prominent place and have many uses
 kalan main ek charavaale bahupad saral varg ke falan hai, kyonki inke avkalan tathaa samakalan ke niyam vishesh rup se saral hai or har sthiti main fal ek bahupad hota he
 In modern function theory, each polynomial is a continuous and analytic function of its variables
 is siddhant main ek mahatvapurn prameya yah he ki yadi sanmishra char kaa koi falan char ke prayek parimit maan ke liye vaishleshik he, to vah ek bahupad hi hoga or yadi char ke aparimit hone par bhi falan parimit rahata he, to vah keval ek achar he
 Polynomials are also used for approximation
 praanrabhik vishleshan ke maanak falan, mclarin athwa tailor prameya ke anusaar, ghaat shrenee dwaara nirupit kiye ja sakate hai
 Karl Wiestrasi proved in 1885 that any continuous function can be represented by a polynomial with a uniform approximation up to any degree of accuracy
 kisi falan ko vyakt karne ke liye ya, ya2, xxrep 4

 Similarly, Hermite polynomials are used in statistics

 Based on the interpolation formula using the given values, the assumption of a polynomial of m-1 power assuming these values is implicit

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit

 172â173 Â°C Lycopene is a red shiny carotene and carotenoid pigment and phytochemical, found in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables, such as red carrots, watermelons, and papayas
 haalanki, rasinic drushti se licopen ek caroten he, par isamen koi vitamin e gatividhi nahin hoti he
 In plants, algae and other photosynthetic biological structures, lycopene is an important mediator of the biological synthesis of most carotenoids, including yellow, orange or red pigments, beta carotene responsible for photosynthesis and light protection
 sanrachanaatmak rup se yah ek tetraterpain he, jo puri tarah carbon or hydrogen se bane aath isoprain ikaayiyon kaa ek sangathit rup he or yah pani main aghulansheel he
 Eleven conjugated double-strand linkages of lycopene give it its dark red color and is responsible for its oxidative resistance activity
 apane shashakt rang or gaiyr-vishaaktata ke kaaran licopen bhojan main prayukt honevaala ek upyogi rang he
 Lycopene is not an essential nutrient for humans, but it is commonly found in the diet, mainly in dishes prepared with tomato sauce
 amashay main avashoshit hone ke baad licopen vibhinn lipo proteinon dwaara rakt main pahunchaaya he or yakrut, adhivrikk grathiyon tathaa viryakosh main jamaa ho jaataa he
 Lycopene has been considered a potential agent for the prevention of many types of cancer, especially prostate cancer, with early research showing adverse inversions in tomato consumption and cancer risk
 haalanki, america ke food and drug administration dwaara kisi swasthya sambandhi daawey ke anumodan ke liye is kshetra ke anusandhan or prostate cancer ke saath iske sambandh ko aparyaapt saboot samajha gaya he 
 Lycopene is a tetraterpen symmetric with an aggregation of 8 isoprenes units
 yah yogicon ke carotenoid parivaar kaa ek sadsy he or chunki yah puri tarah se carbon or hydrogen se bana hota hai, isliye yah ek caroten bhi he
 The separation process of lycopene was first reported in 1910 and the structure of the molecules was determined in 1931
 apane prakritik, ol-trns rup main iske anu lambe or sidhe tathaa apni gyaarah sanyugmit duhare judaav kii pranali se vivash hote hai
 Each double bond or double linkage in this extended Ï electron system reduces the energy required for electrons to transition to higher energy conditions by allowing molecules to absorb visible light at progressively longer wavelengths
 licopen drishyman prakaash kii sarvaadhik lambi tarang dairdhya ke atirikt sabakaa avasorana kar letaa he, atev yah laal dikhaai detaa he
 Plants and photosynthetic bacteria naturally produce all-trance lycopene, but a total of 72 geometric isolates of the molecule are being made possible
 garmi yaa prakaash ke sansparsh se licopen in sis -isomaron ke kisi bhi ek sankhya ke vilgan kii prakriya ke tahat ja saktaa he, jiskaa aakaar sidhaa na hokar usamen ek mode ho saktaa he
 Different isolates exhibit different stability due to their molecular energy
 In the human blood stream, more than 60% of the total lycopene solubility is from different cis -isomers, but the biological effects of individual isomers have not been investigated
 licopen pani main aghulansheel he or keval jaev dravakon tathaa tel main hi ghola ja saktaa he
 Because of its non-polarity, lycopene can leave stains on any substantial magnetized material, including most plastics, when cooking
 ek tamaato kaa daag kisi bhi kapadey se bahut hi aasaani se chhudaaya ja saktaa he 
 jabaki licopen plastic main fail jaataa he tathaa daag ko garam pani or disergent se hataanaa asambhav bana detaa he
 If lycopene is oxidized, the double linkages between the carbon molecules will be split; The conjugated double linkage system will break and vanish its color
 licopen jaise vyanjanon paudhon main paae janevaale prakaash sanshleshak rangadravya protein parisaron, prakaash sanshleshak jeevanuon, fafundi or shaiwal main paae janevaale mahatvapurn rangadravya he
 They are responsible for the bright color of fruits and vegetables, perform various functions in photosynthesis and protect photosynthetic structures from excessive light damage
 licopen beta-caroten or jenthophills jaise anek mahatvapurn carotenoid ke jaiviksanshleshan kaa mukhya madhyam he
 The biosynthesis of lycopene in eukaryotic plants and prokaryotic cyanobacteria is analogous to the enzymes involved
 sanshleshan mewaalonic acid ke saath aarambh hota he, jo dimithailaalil pyrophosphate main badal jaataa he
 It then condenses with three molecules of isopentanyl pyrophosphate to give twenty carbon geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
 iske baad is utpaada ke do anu chalis carbon fiton dene ke liye tail-tu-tail vinyas main sanghanit ho jate hai, jo carotenoid jaev sanshleshan kii ore pehla kadam he
 Phyton is converted to lycopene through several stages of desaturation
 beta caroten ke utpaadan ke liye terminal isoprain ke do samoohon ko cikalijd kiya ja saktaa he, jiske baad ise jenthophills kii vistrut vividhta main tabdeel kiya ja saktaa he
 Fruits and vegetables that contain more lycopene include gak, tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapes, pink guava, papaya, red chili, seabuckthron, wolfberry, and rose fruit, although the amount of lycopene in gak is higher than any known fruit or vegetable
 More, for example, 70 times more than tomatoes
 par gaak ke iske mul kshetra dakshin purvi asiake baahar durlabh hone ki vajah se adhikansh log licopine ke liye aahaar ke mukhya strot ke taur par arthath 85% se adhik tamaato or tamaato aadhaarit sos, zeus or kechap kaa seven karte hai
 The amount of lycopene in tomato depends on its species and increases with the ripening of the fruit
 anya falon or subjiyon ke vipareet, jinamein maujuud vitamin sijaisi poshan saamagree khaanaa pakaane ke dauraan ghat jaati he, tamaato ko banane par usamen baykevelable licopen kii saghanta or bad jaati he
 Lycopene is four times more bioavailable in tomato paste than fresh tomatoes
 isliye kachche tamaato kii tulana main tamaato sos ek pasandida strot he
 While most green leafy vegetables and other sources of lycopene contain less oil and fat, lycopene is insoluble in water and remains tightly attached to vegetable fibers
 tamaato aadhaarit sroton main tamaato kaa sangrakshit ras, soup, sos or kechap jaise tamaato ke sansaadhit utpaada sarvocch baykevelable licopen sandratha yukt hote hai
 The process of cooking and crushing tomatoes and consuming them in more oily dishes increases their inclusion in the bloodstream from the digestive system
 licopen vasa main ghulansheel he isliye ise tel ke avasorana main sahaayak mana jaataa he
 a notable exception is high concentrations of lycopene and saturated and unsaturated fatty acids
 licopen tamaato jaisi subjiyon or falon se praapt kiya ja saktaa he, lekin kavak blikaslia trispora licopen kaa ek anya strot he
 Gak is a promising commercial source for the purpose of purification and extraction of lycopene
 kuch kismon ke tamaato main sis-licopen adhik baykevelable he
 After ingestion, lycopene is incorporated into the fat micelles in the small intestine

 There is little information about the liver metabolic function of lycopene but lycopene, like other carotenoids, is incorporated into chylomicrons and released into the lymphatic system
 antat licopen rakt plasma main bahut kam or kam ghanatv vaale lipoprotein anshon main vitarit hota he
 Lycopene is mainly distributed in adrenal glands, organs and adipose tissue such as the liver and seminum
 licopen vishakt nahin he or saamanytah aahaar main paaya jaataa he, lekin atyadhik carotenoid ke seven ke maamalon kii bhi soochna mili he
 a mature woman who had been consuming tomato juice for a long time, her skin and liver had turned orange yellow and lycopene levels in her blood were also found to be quite high
 teen saptaah tak licopen mukt aahaar lene ke baad uski twachaa kaa saamaanya rang waapas aa gaya
 This skin discoloration is known as lycopenodermia and is not toxic
 licopen singlate oxigen ko nasht karanevaala sabase shaktishaalee carotenoid, jo singlate oxigen vinaashak pareekshan kii parakhnaliyon ke adhyayan main vitamin i kii apeksha 100 guna adhik kushal paaya gaya, jo glutethin kii tulana main 125 guna kushal he
 Singlet-oxygen produced by exposure to ultraviolet light is the primary cause of skin aging
 isaki oxikaarkavirohi sampattiyon ko dekhte hue licopen ke seven or saamaanya swasthya ke bich ek sambhav sahasambandh ke liye paryaapt vaigyanik or naidanik anusandhan samarpit kiya gaya he
 Initial research has indicated some improvement in heart disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis and even male infertility
 licopen kii cancer- nirodhak saamagree kaa vishleshan karne ke liye kai adhyayan kiye gaye hai, haalanki praarambhik anusandhan anirnaayak rahaa he
 There is strong evidence of the benefits of lycopene for lung, stomach and prostate gland cancers
 licopen sharir main vitamin e main sanshodhit nahin he atev ise oxikaran pratirodh jaise anya laabhon ke liye sulabh kiya ja saktaa he
 Lack of beta-ion ring structure for lycopene enhances its antitussive action
 licopen sabase kushal oxigen or mukt kan naashak tathaa plasma or anya utakon main pradhan carotenoid bhi he
 Lycopene is also found in lung tissue and is valuable in protecting lymphocytes from NO2 damage found in lung cancer
 licopen se pet main pilori sankraman se utpann oxikarnaatmak bhaar ke prabhaav ko kam karne main bhi madad mil sakati he
 The tomato-derived carotenoid lycopene phase II can reduce the risk of cancer by activating specific anti-cancer enzymes that remove harmful carcinogens from the body and cells
 maanav cancer koshika prasar ke avarohak ke rup main kiye gaye licopen ke ek adhyayan main yah paaya gaya ki cancer kii koshikaon ke vipareet maanav fibroblasts licopen ke prati kam samvedansheel the or koshikayen samay ke saath dhire-dhire vikaas nirodhak siddh huyin
 endometrial cancer koshika prasar par iske nirodhatmak prabhaav ke alaava licopen insulin ke vruddhi kaarak factor-
 As such it was also found to be helpful in suppressing excitatory growth
 insulin jaise vikaas kaarak stan or endometrial cancer koshika vikaas ke pramukh autocrine / paracrine niamak hai
 Therefore lycopene's intervention in this autocrine / paracrine system may open new avenues of research on the role of lycopene in the regulation of endometrial cancer and other tumors
 tathaapi, vibhinn adhyayana main licopen main motiyobind ke vikaas evam stan tathaa endometrial cancer koshikaon, prostrate carcinoma koshikaon, brihadantra cancer kii koshikaon sahit kai alag-alag prakaar kii cancer koshikaon par nirodhatmak prabhaav bhi paaya gaya he
 After a comprehensive review, it was reported in November 2005 that the United States Food and Drug Administration doubted the possibility of reducing the risk of the disease, as there was no correlation between lycopene and prostate cancer prevention
 However it has been suggested that eating whole tomatoes may benefit, as perhaps the yet unknown compound is a beneficial agent
 epad kii samiksha main ek atyant simit yogyata kaa daawa karne kii anumati di gayi he, jise licopen yukt tamaato or tamaato utpaadon ke liye ek guide ke taur par prayog kiya jaataa he taaki upabhoktaaon ko gumraah na kiya ja sake, jo is prakaar he: Very limited and preliminary scientific research suggests that eating half a cup of tomatoes and / or tomato sauce in a week can reduce the risk of prostate cancer
 epad ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki is daawey kaa samarthan karne ke bahut kam vaigyanik pramaan hai

 puraana-katha-shaastra vah saralatam madhyam mana ja saktaa he jiske dwaara praarambhik maanav ne apane dharmik vichaaron ko prakat kiya
 Vedic religion has been called naturalistic, because, in other words, this religion mainly worshiped natural forces and events, although this is not entirely correct
 vaidic dharm evam parinamat: vaidic puraana-katha shaastra ek vikaas kii parampara main he or unka adhyayan vaidic logon ke saanskrithik itihaasaanukram se sambandhit karke hi kiya ja saktaa he
 This can be done by relating it to its cultural historiography
 apane saanskrithik jivan ke praarambhik kaal main vaidic arya, yaa unke purvaj, prakruti ke ang ke rup main uske adhikadhik sameep the
 In this period he was completely overwhelmed by the vastness and prosperity of nature and miracles
 apni is saral bhavukta main unhone dharmik bhaavana kaa put dena chaha jise falswaroop divine mata pita ke puranic rup "dyavapruthivi" kii bhaavana ai
 They also felt that although nature is vast, it is not unplanned and irregular
 iskaa niyantran kuch nishchit vidhaanon se hota he
 It is not systematic but systematic
 is gyaan se rut ev varun ke puranic roopon kaa udbhavan hua
 Varuna was an Asura, that is, he had a miraculous power called Asu and with his illusion, he tied the world and its small and big were the regulators of different kinds of work
 unhone is prakaar samraat pad praapt kiya
 Friends, Aditi and Aditya were also involved in this mythological complexity of divine ethics
 is divine puranakatha ke saath hi saath agni ke devatv kaa bhi vilaas hua jo vaidic dharmik kaaryon kaa ekmaatr aadhaar thi
 At the same time the divinity of the sacrificial drink Som also developed
 agni jo vaiyakt devon main sarvaadhik drushtigamy thi, aaryon ke grihasth jivan kaa centre evam manushyon or devataaon ke bich sambadh sthapit karanevaali bhi maani gai
 As a general principle it can be accepted that the nature of religion and mythology of some particular people depends on the kind of life they lead
 varun kaa saarvbhaum dharm evam agni or som kaa yagyeey dharm aaryon ke purvajon kii aavashyaktaa kii purti kar detaa tha jab ve apana jivan prakruti ke saath bitaate the evam praarambhik prakaar ke yagyeey kaa paalan karte the
 But on coming to Saptasindhu ahead of Valkh, these people had to face many rival castes
 at: unki dharmik pravriti ne ek nae devtaa ko janm diya jo unke yuddh sambandhi saahas ko badhaava de sake
 His name was Yudhvadeva Indra
 vaidic purana-katha-shaastra kii viksonsheel pravriti indra ke vyaktitv ke vikaas main spasht dikhaai detii he
 Originally Indra was a mannayaka who, aroused by Soma, reached Saptasindhu, leading the Vedic Aryans
 itihaas kramash: puraana-katha-shaastra main parivartit ho gaya or manavnayak ek rashtriya yudhdevataa ban gaya
 In this type of mythology, Indra was later accused of many other characteristics
 indra varsha kaa devtaa mana jaataa tha jisane apane bajra se meghasur vrutra ko markar swarg ke jal ko mukt kiya
 He was also identified with the non-violent hero of ancient stories
 chunki, rugveda kaa ek vrihad ansh vijay evam upnivesh banane kii samay se sabandhit he, yah swaabhaavik hi tha ki vaidic puraana-kathashastra indra kii kathaon se abhibhoot ho
 Mythological forms of the Marutas, Ashvins and Ritas are presumably the cause of the mythology of historical events
 vaidic puraana-katha-shastr ke vikaas main ek mahatvapurn baat "saurikaran" kii he, arthath saura devataaon ke sambandhit puranic vyakti jo mulat: saura devtaa se bilkul hi sambandhit nahin the
 The principal solar deity of Vedic mythology was Surya
 kintu kai kaarnon se saura gun kaa samavesh duusare devataaon main bhi kiya gaya, jaise vishnu, pushan or mitra evam savit 
 In this connection, it can be indicated that in the pious religion there was a means of giving high place to the gods like Vishnu and Pushan, to deliberately, though artificially, with Indra or Agni or Soma
 is sandarbh main yah ullekh he ki ushaa prakruti devi ke rup main surya jaisi he, bilkul paardarshak, yadhyapi vaidic kaviyon ne uske maanviya saundarya ke vishad varnan kiye hai
 The mythological form of Rudra emerged in Vedic Aryan religion as a result of the religion of pre-vedic non-aryans in India
 is devtaa ko mul bhartiya shiv kaa aryikrut rup mana ja saktaa he
 But when Shiva was adopted as Rudra in the Vedic religion, only one part of his whole personality, as the god of death and destruction, was given importance
 duusari ore yama maanav jati kaa janak tha or manav jati ke sangrakshan ke liye swamev dwaara yama mrityu ke liye pehla vyakti bhi hua
 Subsequently he became the lord of all the generations of mankind ie fathers who died after that
 prasangvash is baat kaa bhi sanket kiya ja saktaa he ki yama ke samrajya ke varnanon main swarg kaa varnan bhi praapt hota he, kintu praarambhi vaidic puraana-katha-shaastra main narak kaa gyaan tha, aisa nahin jaan padataa
 Similarly, Gandharvas and Apsaras are not as important in the early Vedic purana-katha-shastra, although a Mantra in the Rigveda mentions the mythology of Urvashi and Pururava
 laghu devataaon main sutron ke swami "brahmanaspati" kaa vishesh mahatv he
 In this connection, mythological sages like Manu, Bhrigu and Angiras can be mentioned
 vaidic puraana-katha-shaastra main bhoot-pret-puja kaa shaayad hi koi sanket ho kintu divine evam ardhadivine gun kuch pashuon ev jad padaarthon main aropit kiye gaye hai
 While referring to Vedic purana-katha Shastra, many mythological stories mentioned in Brahmins should also be mentioned, such as Manu and Pralaya, Shun Shape and Varuna, although many of these things are related to nonvabardhana or yajna of other things
 brahmanon main do atyadhik prachlit puranic abhipraay prajapati ke tapas evam devasurasangram ke hai
 Many philosophical teachings of the Upanishads are also told through the mythology of Indra, Virochan and Uma Haimavati

 It was one of the most outstanding kingdoms of India
 lekin 1972 main assam ke vibhaajan ke pashchaat meghalaya ek alag rajya banaaya gaya or shillong ko nae rajya kii rajdhani banaaya gaya
 For this reason, Assam needed to build a new palace in its capital Guwahati
 nae rajya meghalaya ke astitv main aane ke ek dashak tak assam or meghalaya kaa ek hi rajyapal hota tha jo shillong main awasit tha
 Some rooms of Guwahati Circuit House were permanently reserved for stay during the same Governor's visit to Assam

 a simplified palace was built in 1980 to reduce costs
 par chunki donon rajyon kaa rajyapal abhi bhi ek hi tha or jo adhiktar shillong main awasit tha isliye nae rajbhavan kaa upyog governor camp ke rup main adhik hota tha

 And in all this process, the destruction that has taken place has been a victim of innocent and poor people who are neither Hindus nor Muslims but only humans and Indian citizens

 The term wet scrubber is a variety of devices that describe a furnace to remove pollution from influenza gas or from other gas streams
 ek geela randi, pradooshit gas dhara scrubbing ke taral ke saath sampark main laayaa jaataa he, yah taral ke saath chhidkaav, yah taral kaa ek pool ke madhyam se majaboor dwaara, yaa kuch anya sampark vidhi dwaara itani ke rup main pradooshan ko dur karne ke liye
 geela scrubar yaa kisi bhi vaayu pradooshan niyantran upkaran kii dizin audyogic prakriya kii sthiti or hawa shaamil pradooshan kii prakruti par nirbhar karata he
 Inlet gas characteristics and dust properties are of primary importance
 Scrubbers baat kan or / yaa gasiy pradooshan ikattha karne ke liye dizine kiya ja saktaa he
 Wet scrubbers remove dust particles by capturing them into liquid droplets
 Eliminate pollutant gases by dissolving wet scrubbers or absorbing them into liquid
 Any droplets that are in the scrub inlet gas must be separated from the outlet gas stream through another device referred to as a mist eliminator or entrainment separator
 In addition, the resulting scrubbing liquid must first be treated to any ultimate discharge or is being reused in the plant
 scrubar or scrubbing pranaaliyon ke kai vinyas, sabhi taral or pradooshit gas dhara ke bich achche sampark pradaan karne ke liye dizine kar rahe hai
 This is including their mist eliminators
 chitra 1 VENTURI randi dizin he
 The mist eliminator for VENTURI scrubber is often a separate device called a cyclone separator
 ek geela he randi chote kanon ko ikattha karne kii kshamta aksar sidhe randi main shakti input karne ke liye anupatik he
 Particles larger than 5 micrometers are collected for low energy devices in the form of spray towers
 VENTURI scrubar yaa sankshepan scrubbers ke rup main sanvardhit upkarnon jaise 1 sukshmamapi kanon ke ucch dakshata hataane ko praapt karne ke liye aam taur par ucch urja upkarnon kii aavashyaktaa he
 Additionally, a well-designed and operation entrainment separator or mist eliminator is important to achieve high removal efficiency
 adhik se adhik taral buundon kii sankhya he ki dhundh eliminator ucch sambhavit utsarjan kaa str ke dwaara kabja kar rahe hai nahin
 geele scrubar ki gasiy pradooshan ko dur avasorak ke rup main bheja jaataa he
 Good gas is required to achieve high removal efficiency in liquid contact absorbers
 geela randi dizin ke ek number ke liye pack tower or plate tower sabase aam kiya ja rahaa ke saath gasiy pradooshan hataane ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 If the gas stream is both particulate matter and gases, wet scrubbers are generally the only single air pollution control device, both of which can remove pollution
 geele scrubar yaa to kanon yaa gaison ke liye ucch kshamta hataane ko praapt karne or kar sakate hai kuch udaahranon main, donon ek hi system main pradooshan ke liye ek ucch hataane kii kshamta hasil kar sakate hai
 However, in many cases, the best operating conditions for particulate collection are the poorest for gas removal
 saamaanya main, ucch ek saath gas or kan hataane kshamta praapt karne kii aavashyaktaa he ki unamem se ek aasaani se ekatra ho yaa ek scrubbing jaise abhikarmak ke upyog se chooney yaa sodium hidracasid ke rup main
 Gundayipet is a village in Adilabadu district under the Andhra Pradesh state of India in Kautal division
 parivaar saadharantaya pati, patni or bacchon ke samooh ko kehete hai, kintu duniya ke adhikansh bhaagon main vah sammilit vaasavale rakt sambandhiyon kaa samooh he jisamen vivaah or dattak pratha dwaara sweekrut vyakti bhi sammilit hai
 In all societies, children are born and brought up in the family
 bacchon kaa sanskaar karne or samaaj ke aachaar vyavhaar main unhen dikshit karne kaa kaam mukhya rup se parivaar main hota he
 Through this, the cultural heritage of the society is transferred from one generation to another
 vyakti kii saamaajik maryaada bahut kuch parivaar se hi nirdhaarit hoti he
 Male-female sexual relationships are mainly fixed within the family
 audyogic sabhyataa se utpann jansankul samaajon or nagaron ko yadi chhod diya jaae to vyakti kaa parichay mukhyat: uske parivaar or kul ke aadhaar par hota he
 Although there are many distinctions of the family in terms of composition, size, relationship and work in different regions and different periods of the world, these above mentioned tasks are universal and universal
 usamen desh, kaal, paristhiti or pratha aadi ke bhed sa ek yaa anek pidiyon kaa or ek yaa anek danpatiyon athwa pati-patniyon ke samoohon kaa hona sambhav he, uske sadsy ek paariwarik anushaasan vyavastha ke atirikt pati or patni, bhai or bahan, pitamah or pautra, chachaa or bhattije, saas or putravadhu jaise sambandhon tathaa kartavyon evam adhikaron se paraspar aabaddh, anya saamaajik samoohon ke sandarbh main ek ghanishtatam antarang samooh ke rup main rahete hai
 Within the family, the division of sex between men and women is also universal and time-bound
 striyon kaa adhikansh samay ghar main vyateet hota he
 Making food, taking care of children and cleaning the house and sewing clothes etc
 are such tasks which come in the female part
 purush bahari tathaa adhik shram ke kaary karata he, jaise kheti, vyapaar, udyog, pashuchaaran, shikaar or ladaai aadi
 Even then, this division is not same in all societies, it is difficult to make even a large general list because in many societies women also take part in activities like farming and hunting
 yo Family forms are closely related to forms of marriage
 levis margan aadi vikasvaadiyon kaa mat he ki maanav samaaj kii praarambhik avasthaa main vivaah pratha nahin thi or purna kamachar prachlit tha
 This was followed by a state of youth marriage, polyandry, polyandry and monogamy or monogamy in the social development
 vastut: bahuvivaah or ekapatnitv kii pratha asabhy or sabhy sabhi samaajon main pai jaati he
 Therefore, this view does not appear to be evidence
 maanav shishu ke paalan poshan ke liye lambii avadhi apekshit he or pehle bachein kii baalyavastha main hi anya chote bachche utpann hote rahete hai
 Mother's care in pregnancy and obstetric care is necessary
 phir, pashuon kii bhanti manushya main rati kii koi vishesh ritu nahin he
 Therefore, probably in the beginning of human society, either the entire community or a group of husband, wife and children was the family
 maanav vaigyanikon ko koi aisa samaaj nahin mila jahaan vivaah sambandh parivaar ke andar hi hote hon, at: pitristhaneey parivaar main patni ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main pati ko atirikt sadsyta pradaan kii jaati he
 In the couple's family, husband and wife together establish their separate household
 kintu adhikansh samaajon main yah parivaar brihattar kautumbik samooh kaa ang mana jaataa he or jivan ke anek prasangon main parivaar par brihattar kautubik samooh kaa, ghanisht sambadh ke atirikt, niyantran hota he
 In industrialized countries like the USA, there has been a multiplicity of couples in place of a family of couples
 yadhyapi vahaan kaa samaaj pitruvansheey he, phir bhi yugal parivaar vahaan kisi ek brihattar kutumb kaa ang nahin mana jaataa
 The couple consists of a husband wife and, on birth, their unmarried children
 sammilit pariwaron main inke atirikt vivaahit bachche or unki santan, vivaahit bhai athwa bahan or unke bachche saath rah sakate hai
 The circumference of blood relatives in the included family is different in different societies
 bharat jaise desh main ek sammilit parivaar main saadhaarant: 10-12 sadsy hote hai, kintu kuch pariwaron main sadasyon kii sankhya 50-60 yaa 100 tak hoti he
 Families have different forms and types based on different forms of marriage, lineage, ownership and authority
 matrusthaneey parivaar main pati apni patni ke ghar kaa sthaayee yaa asthaayee sadsy banataa he, jabaki pitristhaneey parivaar main patni pati ke ghar jaakar rahati he
 Maternal families are generally matriarchal and patrilineal families are patrilineal
 bahudhaa parivaar kii sampatti kaa swaamitv pitristhaneey parivaar main purush ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main nari ko praapt he
 The eldest child is usually the heir to the property
 kintu yah aavashyak nahin he
 In the tribe like Garo of India, only the smallest girl is the owner of the family property
 anek samaajon main parivaar ke sabhi stri yaa purush sadasyon main swamitv nihit hota he or kuch main purush tathaa stri donon ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikaar praapt he
 Family rule is ruled by men in most societies
 antar itnaa he ki pitruvansheey pariwaron main saadhaarant: pita athwa ghar kaa sabase bada purush or matruvansheey pariwaron main mamaa yaa mata kaa anya sabase bada raktasambandhi ghar kaa mukhiya hota he
 Therefore, in most parts of the world and in societies, male dominance is found
 sansar main daanpaty jivan main praaia: ekapatnitv hi sabase adhik prachlit he, yadhyapi anek samaajon main purushon ko ek se adhik patniyaan rakhane kii bhi chhot he
 On the contrary, there is a practice of polyandry and a type of youth marriage in the Toda and Khas tribes and in some regions of Tibet
 isi prakaar bharat main khaasi, gaaro or america main hopi, hedia jaisi janajatiyaan bhi hai jo matrusthaneey or matruvansheey hai
 In these forms of marriage there is a difference in the composition and form of the family
 aadhunik audyogic kranti ke falswaroop parivaar kii rachana or kaaryon main gambhir parivartan parilakshith hue hai
 In all earlier societies, the family was the most important and fundamental institution of society
 jivan kaa adhikansh vyapaar parivaar ke madhyam se sampann hota tha
 The family is no longer a unit of production in these industrial societies
 bacchon ke shikshan kaa kaary shikshan sansthaaon ne liya he
 The kitchen work has gone to commercial eateries and refreshments
 manoranjan ke liye pruthak sanghathan sthapit ho gaye hai
 The responsibility of social security went to the state and due to the decreasing influence of religion, religious acts have been replaced by secondary
 pati or patni kaa adhikansh samay ghar ke baahar vyateet hota he
 Yet the family remains and carries out some important functions, which are called permanent or residual functions of the family
 janajatiyon main, jo saamaajik vikascram main aadim avasthaa ke adhik nikat hai, vivaah or parivaar ke praaia: sabhi prakaar milte hai
 From the point of view of development in these different types, it is not possible to determine the preorder
 kand mul or shikaar par basar karanevaale andamani aadimvasiyon main ekapatnitv kaa niyam he or ve pitruvansheey tathaa pitristhaneey hai
 The farming Hopi clan of North America has a practice of monogamy or monogamy but is matrilineal and maternal
 adhikansh janajaatiyon main parivaar kaa sanyukt rup he, kintu jahaan pati patni alag ghar main rahete hai, ve bhi ek brihattar parivaar ke ang hote hai or yah parivaar sammilit sampatti, aarthik kriyaaon, dharmik krityon tathaa anek pariwarik adhikaron evam kartavyon aadi se grathit ek pruthak ikai hota he
 Of the two genealogies, a tribe is either ancestral or matrilineal
 jo kabeeley matruvansheey hai ve praaia: matrusthaneey bhi hai, jahaan pati parivaar kaa sthaayee yaa asthaayee sadsy hota he
 In the Garo clan, it is only the visitor who is an overnight guest
 kintu matruvansheey or matrusthaneey kabeeley bahut kam hai
 The polyandry clan is even less
 pitruvansheey kabeelon main hi bahupati pratha pai gai he or inamen nari kaa varja purush kii apeksha hin he
 In the patriarchal tribes, men are often allowed to have more than one wife, but there is very little that only specific and powerful people can do
 aisi avasthaa main patniyaan ek ghar main bhi rahati hai or paas paas bane alag alag gharon main bhi
 Youth marriage in its pure form is not found in any clan
 jonsaar babar main bhratuk bahupati pratha he
 There, siblings sometimes keep more than one wives and they all have collective wives, who are part of a family and family
 matruvansheey or matrusthaneey kabeelon main bhi shaasha varg purush he, kintu nari ke adhikaron tathaa pratishtha kii drushti se pitruvansheey or pitristhaneey kabeelon kii apeksha inaki sthiti praaia: acchhee he
 In many ancestral tribes, the status of male and female is almost equal, however in most of the tribes, it is inferior to male
 kabeelon main vivahaviched or punarvivaah kaa niyam he or is sambandh se stri or purush ko praaia: samaan adhikaar hai
 In fact, most of the tribes are ancestral and the woman has to go to the family, family and colony of the man after marriage, where the husband has mother, father, brother and other blood relatives and friends
 vahaan use pati ke kutuban kaa ang hokar use bade logon ke anushaasan main rahanaa hota he or pati ke kulachaar kaa paalan karnaa hota he
 In the event of marriage, the woman has to take refuge in her parents
 matrusthaneey kabeelon main parivaar adhik sthaayee dikhaai padataa he
 This seems to be a natural group of blood relatives
 bahut kam kabeeley aise hai jahaan ladke yaa ladakiyon ko vivaah ke pehle brahmacharya paalan kaa niyam ho
 Some tribes have a pre-marriage trial period
 jonsaar babar ke khason main abhyaagton ke swaagat main parivaar kii avivaahit ladakiyon kaa sambhog ke liye prastut karne kii pratha he
 This makes it clear that the existence of the family is not for the male female lust, but is controlled by the family
 bharat mukhyat: krishipradhan desh he or yahan kii paariwarik rachana praaia: krishi kii aavashyaktaaon se prabhavit he
 In addition, the dignity and ideals of the Indian family are traditional
 kisi anya samaaz main grihasth jivan kii itani pavitrataa tathaa pita, putr bhai bhai or pati patni ke itane sthaayee sambandhon kaa udhaaharan nahin miltaa
 Although many distinctions are found in various fields, religions and castes in terms of the practice of secular rights, marriage and marriage, etc
, the ideal of joint family is well accepted
 sanyukt parivaar main sambandhiyon kaa dayera pati, patni tathaa unki avivaahit santanon se bhi adhik vyapak hota he
 Often, individuals of three generations and sometimes even more generations in the same discipline in a house and belonging to a kitchen consume the property involved and participate in the family's religious functions and rituals
 yadhyapi musalamaanon or isaayiyon main sampatti ke niyam bhinn hai, tathaapi sanyukt parivaar ke adarsh, paramparaayen or pratishtha ke kaaran in saanpattik adhikaron kaa vyaavhaarik paksh parivaar ke sanyukt rup ke anukool hi rahata he
 The joint family has its origins in ancient traditions and ideals in addition to India's agrarian economy
 ramayana or mahabharat kii gaathaon dwaara yah adarsh jan jan tak pahonchte hai
 Agriculture has provided the stability of family life everywhere
 at: bhartiya samaaj main parampara se utpaadan kaary, upbhog or suraksha kii buniyadi ikai parivaar he
 Indian society, with exceptions, is patriarchal, patriarchal and patriarchal
 yahan purush kii apeksha nari kaa darja hin mana jaataa he
 Women have been considered to have very limited rights over property
 phir bhi, gruhasthi ke anek maamalon main uski mahatta sweekrut he
 Generally, a marriage is recognized
 kintu purush ko ekaadhik vivaah karne kaa adhikaar he
 According to the traditional ideal, widow marriage is prohibited, but a widower can marry
 pativrata dharm kii bahut mahima he
 Pitra Puja also has a heavy significance
 ucch jatiyon ko chhodkar anya sabhi jatiyon main praaia: vivaah viched or vidhwaa vivaah prachlit he
 But when a caste wants to elevate its dignity, it rejects both these practices
 ghar kaa sabase adhik vayovruddh purush, yadi vah kaarynivrutt na ho gaya ho to sanyukt parivaar kaa karta athwa mukhiya hota he
 Somewhere he is also called the owner
 yah karta anya vayovruddh yaa vayask sadasyon kii salaah se yaa uske bina hi parampara ke aadhaar par parivaar main kaaryavibhaajan, utpaadan, upbhog aadi kii vyavastha karata he or parivaar tathaa uske sadasyon se sambadhit saamaajik mahatv ke prashnon kaa nirnay karata he
 The eldest woman in the household is the head of the female section of the family and supervises and arranges the work assigned to women
 bhojan taiyaar karnaa bacchon kaa paalan poshan karnaa tathaa katai aadi mahilaon ke mukhya kaam hai
 As such, they also help in some minor tasks of farming or business
 sanyukt parivaar main chachaa, taaoo kii vivaahit santan or uske vivaahit putr, pautra aadi bhi ho sakate hai
 Generally, in the life of a father, his son does not separate from the family and settle in an independent family, but this is not an impenetrable tradition
 aisa samay aata he jab raktasambandhon kii nikatataa ke aadhaar par ek sanyukt parivaar do yaa anek sanyukt athwa asamyukt pariwaron main vibhakt ho jaataa he
 The disjoint family also takes a combined form in the chronology and the order of the joint family remains
 sanyukt parivarpranali yadhyapi bahut pracheen he, tathaapi iske aantarik swaroop main bahirvivaah, uttaradhikaar tathaa saanpattik adhikaar ke niyamon main, kalkram main parivartan hota rahaa he
 The Industrial Revolution has disrupted the traditional joint family in western countries, due to which the livelihood security and advancement facilities are given to the person outside the family as a result of increased mechanization
 bharat main bhi audyogic kranti ke falswaroop nai arthvyavastha or nae audyogic tathaa aarthik sanghathanon kaa aarambh ho chukaa he
 New means of transport and communication are becoming available and urbanization is taking place at a rapid pace
 paashchaatya vichaardhaara or paashchaatya dhang kii shiksha diksha tathaa aadarshon kaa prabhaav bhi kam nahin he
 Laws have been enacted especially in relation to marriage, succession, adoption and secular rights after independence
 They are considered harmful to the joint system of the family
 isi prakaar iskar ke niyam bhi iske pratikul padate hai
 Adult suffrage political democracies are also attacking the unitary and individual existence of the joint family
 aisi avasthaa main jab arthvyavastha or utpaadan ke sadhano main bhi buniyadi parivartan ho rahaa he, parivaar ke shashan, rachana or kaaryon main herpher hona avashyambhavi he or vah parilakshith bhi ho rahaa he
 But it is difficult to say that the joint form of the family is ending
 nagaron or graamon main sanyukt parivaar pehle se kam ho gaye hai, iskaa koi pramaan nahin he
 There are mainly two types of ideas among scholars regarding change
 ek vichaar ke anusaar paristhiti ke prabhavaswaroop parivaar main katipay parivartan hone par bhi uskaa sanyukt rup nasht nahin ho rahaa he
 According to the second view, industrial civilization will present a joint family in India as much as the same couple family which has emerged in America and Europe
 vartmaan paariwarik vighatan env parivartanon ko is prakram kii aarambhik avasthaa bataaya jaataa he

 Through them, the person is not a particular state of mind or departmental power, but the person as a whole
 praaia: ye uttejk saamaanya vastu nahin hote, balki inaki kritrim rachanaatmak prastuti hua karti he
 There is also controversy as to whether or not personality test examinations should be taken in clinical examinations

 bhartiya darshan ke chah prakaaron main se sankhya bhi ek he jo prachinkaal main atyant lokapriy tathaa prathit hua tha
 It is a philosophy with absolutely opposite beliefs from Advaita Vedanta
 isaki sthapana karne vaale mul vyakti kapil kahe jate hai
 The literal meaning of 'sankhya' is 'numerical' or analysis
 isaki sabase pramukh dharna sristi ke prakruti-purush se bani hone kii he, yahan prakruti jad he or purush chetan
 The principles of shiva-shakti of the Shaktas, the energy sources of the Yoga scriptures, are seen in parallel
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya
 mahabharatakaar ne yahan tak kaha he ki gyaanan c loke yadihasti kinchit sankhyagatan tachch mahanmahatman 
 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology
 shaanti parv ke kai sthalon par sankhya darshan ke vichaaron kaa bade kavyamay or rochak dhang se ullekh kiya gaya he
 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita
 isaki lokapriyata kaa kaaran ek yah avashya rahaa he ki is darshan ne jivan main dikhaai padane vaale vaishamy kaa samaadhaan trigunatmak prakruti kii sarvakaaran rup main pratishtha karke bade sundar dhang se kiya
 The great quality of this nature-cause-debate of Sankhyacharyas is that the solution of the asymmetry of the world on the basis of the satta, rajas and tamas elements of different religions seems very wise
 kisi loukik samasya ko ishwar kaa niyam na maanakar in prakrutiyon ke talmail bigadane or jeevon ke purusharth na karne ko kaaran bataaya gaya he
 That is, the greatest greatness of Sankhya philosophy is that the origin of creation in it is not considered by God but it has been understood as a developmental process and it is believed that the creation after passing through many stages, in its present form Has been received
 kapilacharya ko kai anishvaravaadi maanate hai par bhagavadagita or satyarthprakash jaise granthon main is dharna kaa nishedh kiya gaya he
 The mainstay of Sankhya philosophy is hospitality
 is siddhanth ke anusaar, bina kaaran ke kaary kii utpatti nahin ho sakati
 As a result, this world has its origin from zero, not from any fundamental entity
 yah siddhanth baudhon ke shoonyavad ke vipareet he
 Work remains in the full cause of its origin
 kaary apane kaaran kaa saar he
 Work and reason are express and latent forms of virtually the same process
 satkaryawad ke do bhed hai- parinamwad tathaa vivartvaad
 Consequentialism implies that reason is transformed into action in real form
 jaise til tel main, doodh dahi main roopantarit hota he
 According to discourse, change is real rather than real
 jaise-rassi main sarp kaa abhas hona
 Sankhya philosophy was very popular and famous in ancient times
 bhartiya samskruti main kisi samay sankhya darshan kaa atyant unchaa sthaan tha
 The lofty minds of the country used to think through the method of Samkhya
 mahabharatakaar ne yahan tak kaha he ki gyaanan c loke yadihasti kinchit sankhyagatan tachch mahanmahatman 
 In fact, in the Mahabharata, the background of philosophical thought has an important place in numerology
 shanti parv ke kai sthalon par sankhya darshan ke vichaaron kaa bade kavyamay or rochak dhang se ullekh kiya gaya he
 The influence of Sankhya philosophy is sufficiently existing on the philosophical background propounded in the Gita
 vastut: sankhya darshan kisi samay atyant lokapriy ho gaya tha
 Whatever may be the reasons for its popularity, but one must have seemed that this philosophy has resolved the contrast seen in life in a beautiful manner by reposing the trinitarian nature as omnipresent
 sankhyacharyon ke is prakruti-kaaran-vaad kaa mahaan gun yah he ki pruthak-pruthak dharm vaale satvon, rajas tathaa tamas tatwon ke aadhaar par jagat ke vaishamy kaa kiya gaya samaadhaan bada nyaayayukt tathaa buddhigamya prathit hota he
 The word "samkhya" is derived by adding the atomic suffix to the word "number" and the etymology of the word number is samachaksham dhatiya khyan darshanya suffix top, according to which it means Samyakti Khyati, Sadhu Darshan or True Knowledge
 sankhyacharyon kii yah samyak khyaati, unka yah satya gyaan vyaktavyakt rup dwividh achit tatv se purush rup chit tatv ko pruthak jaan lene main nihit he
 The man remains virtually untouched even if he appears to be stained in the prapancha from the top
 usamen aasakt yaa lipt dikhaai padane par bhi vastut: anasakt yaa nirlypt rahata he--sankhyacharyon kii yah sabase badi darshanik khoj unheen ke shabdon main satvapurushanyatakhyati, vivek khyaati, vyaktavyaktjvvigyaan, aadi naamon se vyavahrut hoti he
 With this wisdom, people believe in accomplishing the ultimate effort or goal of human life
 is prakaar "sankhya", shabd sankhyacharyon kii sabase badi darshanik khoj kaa vaastavik swaroop prakat karne vaala sankshipt naam he jiske sarvapratham vyaakhyaata hone ke kaaran unki vichaardhaara atyant pracheen kaal main "sankhya" naam se abhihit hui
 The term "samkhya" is also considered to be a fallacy from the word "number"
 mahabharat main sankhya ke vishay main aae hue ek shloke main ye donon hi prakaar ke bhav prakat kiye gaye hai
 It is as follows - Number Prakurvate Chave Prakriti Prakrakshate
 tattwani c chatuvinshad ten sankhya: prakirtita:
 The meaning of this is that the number which preaches the wisdom of nature and man, which imparts the effect of nature and the number which determines the number twenty-four of the elements, are called Sankhya
 kuch logon kii aisi dharna he ki gnanarthak "sankhya" shabd se kii jane vaali gaun sankhya main prakruti evam purush ke vivek gyaan se hi jivan ke param lakshya kaivalya yaa moksh kii siddhi maani gai he, at: us gyaan kii prapti hi mukhya he or is kaaran se usee par sankhya kaa sara bal he
 Sankhya assumes twenty-four elements, it is just a statement of a common fact, hence secondary
 udaiveer shastri ne apane "sankhya darshan kaa itihaas" naamak granth main sankhya shaastra ke kapil dwaara pranit hone main bhagwat 3-25-1 par shridhar swami kii vyakhya ko uddhrut karte hue is prakaar likhaa he- antim shloke kii vyakhya karte hue vyakhyaakaar ne spasht likhaa he- tatwanaa sankhyata ganak: sankhya-pravartak ityarth:
 This makes it certain that this Kapil is the innovator or prophet of Sankhya
 shridhar swami ke ganak: shabd par shastri ji ne neeche die gaye footnot main is prakaar likhaa he- madhya kaal ke kuch vyakhyakaaron ne "sankhya" pad main "sankhya" shabd ko gananaaparak samajhakar is prakaar ke vyaakhyaan kiye hai
 In fact, it means elemental knowledge
 parantu gaharaai se vichaar karne par yah baat utani saamaanya yaa gaun nahin he jitani apatat: prathit hoti he
 It seems that in very early times when the number of elements could not be fixed in the initial stage of philosophical development, then Sankhya first tried the subtle metaphysics of this visible physical world, which in turn resulted in the number of elements present in its origin
 : Was determined twenty four
 inamen bhi pratham tatv jise unhone "prakruti" yaa "pradhan" naam diya, shesh taees kaa mul siddh kiya gaya
 This same element "nature" was considered to be the result of the Chish Purush, resulting in twenty-three different elements respectively and generating the entire root world
 is prakaar tatv sankhya ke nirdhaaran ke peeche sankhyon kii bahut badi bauddhik sadhana chhipi hui prathit hoti he
 After all, how would it have been possible to determine the number of elements through micro-intelligence without thinking and analyzing for a long time? uparyukt vivechan se aisa nishchay hota he ki sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam donon hi prakaaron se uske buddhivaadee tarkpradhan hone kaa suchak he
 Even considering the basic nature of the figures and the Chit Purush both of the basic elements as proven by the Agama or Shruti proof, it is also evident to prove it mainly on the basis of conjecture proof
 aaj kal uplabdh sankhya pravachan sutara evam sankhyakarik, in donon hi moulik sankhya granthon ko dekhne se spasht gyaat hota he ki inamen sankhya ke donon hi moulik tatwon- prakruti evam purush kii satta hetuon ke aadhaar par anumaan dwaara hi siddh kii gai he
 Tips are also given in the man's plurality
 satkaryawad kii sthapana bhi tarkon ke hi aadhaar par kii gai he
 
 is prakaar sankhya shaastra kaa shravan, jo vivek gyaan kaa muladhar he, tark pradhan he
 Contemplation is the contemplation of facts and principles scripted by long-term arguments
 is prakaar jis sankhya yaa vivek gyaan ke kaaran sankhya darshan kaa "sankhya" naam padaa, uskaa vishesh sambandh tark or buddhivaadita se he
 Due to this rationalism, some theories of Sankhya philosophy developed very independently from the Vedic sect in the later period, due to which the Acharyas like Badarayana Vyasa and Shankaracharya refuted it and even said it to the vedic sect
 yah sampradaay apane mul main to avaidic nahin prathit hota or apane parvarti rup main bhi sarvatha avaidic nahin he
 The famous commentator Vigyanbhukta has also considered Sankhya to be the contemplation of Agama or Shruti by the Satta arguments
 unhone apane sankhya pravachan-sutara-bhashya kii avataranika main yahi baat is prakaar kahi he- jo "akodwitiya:" ityadi purush vishyak veda vachan jeev kaa sara abhiyaan dur karke use mukt karaane ke liye us purush ko sarv prakaar ke vaishamry- rupabhed se rahit bataate hai unheen veda vachanon ke arth ke manan ke liye apekshit sad yuktiyon kaa upadesh karne ke liye sankhyakarta narayanavatar bhagwaan kapil aavirbhoot hue the
