 Its representatives are unicellular, of many shapes, types and forms
 jaise saamaanya bahumoortidarshi main kaach ke chote chote tukade anek rup ke dikhaai dete hai unheen roopon ke sadrush se diatem samooh bhi hote hai
 The cell of each diatom is richly siliculated and of this texture as if two petri dishes are kept close to each other
 prayek diatem kii jab upree tah se pariksha kii jaati he, to isaki dwiparshvik, yaa areey samamiti ke chihn spasht prathit hote hai
 The cell has one or several, variegated brownish-yellow pigments
 koshika ke bahya takshan ke aadhaar par diatmon kaa vargeekaran hota he
 Both cell walls of each diatom, including the internal process, are called fructules
 upree koshika bhitti apithika tathaa bhitari hypothika kehalaati he or donon kaa silikamay bhaag lagbhag chaude balve kaa hota he, jiske flanz sadrush upant sanyoji band yaa singulam se lage hote hai
 This connective band is often well connected with the wallb
 kabhi kabhi ek se adhik bhi sanyoji band hote hai
 These are called internal bands
 frestul ko valve kii chor se dekhne par valve tal tathaa sanyoji band kii ore se dekhne par valayital dikhaai detaa he
 According to Kupin, the material by which the frstule becomes silicable is aluminum silicate
 pimmersaal ke matanusaar jal madhyam main silicket lavenon kii prachurtaa se prajnan main sahaayta hoti he
 The silicon that collects in the valve is symmetrical around a central point in the centriole diatom
 pinnet diatmon main aksheeya pattica se yah dwiparshv samamit yaa asamamit ho saktaa he
 In some marine centriole diatoms, the cracking is sufficiently rough
 yah visheshat: yatra tatra gartarome ke kaaran hota he
 These grafts have finely umbilical holes
 kuch pinneliz diatmon main ek yaa adhik satya chhidr ho sakate hai, jo gaminheart ke anusaar madhya athwa dhruviya hote hai
 These thin spots, called punctates, are bipartite, configured in queues and a perpendicular plaque moving along the length of the valve, which may be called the axial region
 yah aksheeya kshetra banaavat main sam ho sakate hai, athwa inamen ek lambii zairi, raafe, ho sakati he
 The axillary region without long furrow is called cod rafe
 ek frestul ke donon valve ke aksheeya kshetra praaia: samaan hote hai, yadhyapi kuch genera main ek main raafe ho saktaa he tathaa duusare main kuta raafe
 a central gland is formed by the fixation of the wall in the middle of each passage, and there are also polar glands at both ends
 frestul ke bheetar protoplast main sarvapratham cytoplasm kii ek tah hoti he, jisamen ek yaa anek varnakan hote hai
 a round nucleus is located in some cytoplasm of the central part of a clear vacuole within and within the cytoplasm
 varnakan anek prakaar ke ho sakate hai
 Pyrenees are present in these, or they are not
 varnakan praaia: sunahare rang ke hote hai
 Safe food content is often fat
 raafe se yukt diatem gatisheel hote hai
 They move with a long axis shock
 ye jatke ek ke baad ek hote hai
 When something moves forward, the diatom stops with a stroke and comes back again
 mular ke matanusaar diatem kii yah gati cytoplasm main dhaaraon ke kaaran hoti he
 There is also cell division in the diatom
 is kriya main do santati-koshikaaye nirmit ho jaati hai, jo aapas main swabhaavat: choti badi hoti hai
 In addition to nucleation, pigmentation also divides
 koshika vibhaajan ke falswaroop ek anujaat protoplast kaa ansh ipithika ke bheetar rahata he or doosraa hypothika main
 After this, two new diatoms are prepared in each progeny on the other side of the cell wall
 anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki navnirmit aadha bhaag sadaiv hypothika hoga tathaa purana avshisht bhaag chaahe vah pehle apithika rahaa ho yaa hypothika, is nae diatem main sadaiv apithika hoga
 From this one can imagine that in this way cells will gradually shrink in size as a result of each division, but in reality the new cells of small size become oxospores, and then regenerate cells of initial shape
 pinneliz rv main ye oxospore do koshikaon ke sanyugman se banate hai
 The conjugation of two cells will form two oxospores, or two cells can be joined together in a chola and each can form one auxospore without conjugation, or only one cell can form one auxospore, or one cell has two auxospores
 Can be made
 centreliz varg main laghu vijaanu bhi utpann hote hai
 Their number increases from 128 to 128 in the order of 4, 8, 16 within a cell
 carsten evam shmit ke anusaar in laghu bijaanuon kaa nirmaan cytoplasm main khachan or phir vibhaajan ke falswaroop hota he
 According to Gaitler, this action is based on semiautonomy
 in laghu bijaanuon main kashabh bhi hote hai
 Many centriole diatoms have another type of spore, which is called the stratospore
 diatmon kaa vargeekaran mukhyat: shut ke vargeekaran ke aadhaar par hi hua he
 The main fact in this is the variation of cytoplasm
 fossil rup main diatem bahusankhya main praapt hote hai, yahan tak ki is punj ko diatem mrittika kii sangya di gai he
 This classification is also suitable for these fossil diatoms
 adhikansh fossil diatem criteshas yug ke purv ke nahin hai
 They have been found in abundance in Centamaria Oil Fields, California
 ye fossil 700 foot moti tahon main vyaapt hai, jo milon lambii chali gai hai
 Soil of fossil diatoms is commercially important
 chaandi kii polish karne main yah upyogi he evam drav nitroglissrin ko sokhne ke liye bhi upyukt he, jisase dianemite adhik suraksha se sthanantarit kiya ja saktaa he
 Today, about 60% of diatom clay is used to filter liquids in Chinese refineries
 iske atirikt is mrittika kaa upyog kisi ansh tak paint tathaa varanish aadi ke nirmaan main bhi hota he
 Diatom clay is also used as an insulator in ventilation furnaces where the temperature is excessive
 saamaanya taap to kya 600 degree sein
 taap tak yah ooshmaarodhi ke rup main purnat: safal rahati he
 Social change is a broad and difficult subject highlighting the fundamental changes of society
 is prakriya main samaaj kii sanrachana evam karypranali kaa ek nayaa janm hota he
 Under this, many patterns of status, class, level and behavior are basically formed and deteriorated
 samaaj gatisheel he or samay ke saath parivartan avashyambhavi he
 In the modern world, there has been development in every sphere and various societies in their own way have encapsulated these developments, answering them, which is reflected in social changes
 in parivartanon kii gati kabhi teevr rahi he kabhi mand
 Sometimes these changes have been very important, sometimes absolutely unimportant
 kuch parivartan aakasmik hote hai, hamaari kalpana se pare or kuch aise hote hai jisaki bhavishyavaanee sambhav thi
 It is easy to keep pace with some, while it is difficult to accept something easily
 kuch saamaajik parivartan spasht he evam drushtigat hai jab ki kuch dekhe nahin ja sakate, unka keval anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 We have been involved subconsciously without knowing the process and consequences of most changes
 jab ki kai baar in parivartanon ko hamaari ichha ke viruddh ham par thopa gaya he
 Many times we have also become silent witnesses of changes
 vyavastha ke prati lagaav ke kaaran maanav mastishk in parivartanon ke prati prarambh main shankaalu rahata he parantu shaniah unhen sweekaar kar letaa he
 Slaughter party saamaajik parivartan ke antargat ham mukhya rup se teen tathyon kaa adhyayan karte hai- To clarify the meaning of social change, we will consider some major definitions
 makiver evam pej ne apni pustak sosayadi main saamaajik parivartan ko spasht karte hue bataaya he ki samajashastri hone ke naate hamaara pratyaksh sambandh saamaajik sambandhon se he or usamen aae hue parivartan ko ham saamaajik parivartan kahenge
 According to Davis, social change means a change in the structure and functions of a social organization
 ech0 em0 johnson ne saamaajik parivartan ko bahut hi sankshipt evam arthpurna shabdon main spasht karte hue bataaya ki mul arthon main saamaajik parivartan kaa arth sanrachanaatmak parivartan he
 Like Johnson, Giddens has pointed out that social change refers to a change in infrastructure or a basic institution
 upar kii paribhaashaon ke sambandh main yah kaha ja saktaa he ki parivartan ek vyapak prakriya he
 Divergence in any area of society can be called social change
 vichlan kaa arth yahan kharaab yaa asaamaajik nahin he
 Social, economic, political, religious, moral, material etc
 Any kind of change that can happen in all fields can be called social change
 yah vichlan swayan prakruti ke dwaara yaa maanav samaaj dwaara yojanabaddh rup main ho saktaa he
 Change can either come in the entire structure of the society or it can be limited to any particular aspect of the society
 parivartan ek sarvakalik ghatana he
 It is always an ongoing process in some form or the other
 parivartan kyon or kaise hota he, is prashn par samajashastri abhi tak ekamat nahin hai
 Therefore, the meaning of an important but complex process like change is still a matter of controversy
 kisi bhi samaaj main parivartan kii kya gati hogi, yah us samaaj main vidyaman parivartan ke kaarnon tathaa un kaarnon kaa samaaj main saapekshik mahatv kya he, is par nirbhar karata he
 To clarify the nature of social change, a discussion of its salient features is required here
 visheshtayen nimnlikhit hai
 Wilbert e 'mor has discussed the characteristics of social change in his own way keeping in mind the modern society, they are- kuch samajashastriyon kaa kahana he ki saamaajik parivartan ke kuch mukhya strot hai
 These are: saamaajik parivartan kii prakriya kai roopon main prakat hoti hai, jaise- udvikas, pragati, vikaas, saamaajik aandolan, kranti ityadi
 Since these social processes are directly related to social change or are sometimes considered synonymous with social change, there is considerable confusion regarding the meaning of these words
 inkaa spashtikaran nimnlikhit hai
 The term 'evolution' was first used by Charles Darwin in the field of biology
 darwin ke anusaar udvikas kii prakriya main jeev kii sanrachana saralata se jatilta kii ore badhati he
 This process is based on the principle of natural selection
 aarambhik samajashastri harbart spencer ne jaivik parivartan kii bhanti hi saamaajik parivartan ko bhi kuch aantarik shaktiyon ke kaaran sambhav mana he or kaha he ki udvikas kii prakriya dhire-dhire nishchit staron se guzarati hui puri hoti he
 Explaining the concept of development, Makiver and Page wrote that development is a kind of development
 par prayek vikaas udvikas nahin he kyonki vikaas kii ek nishchit disha hoti he, par udvikas kii koi nishchit disha nahin hoti he
 Developing in any field will be called evolution
 makiver evam pej ne bataaya he ki udvikas sirf aakaar main nahin balki sanrachana main bhi vikaas he
 If the size of the society does not increase and it becomes more internally complex than before, it will be called evolution
 parivartan jab achchhai kii disha main hota he to use ham pragati kehete hai
 Progress reflects a certain direction of social change
 pragati main samaaj-kalyaan or samuhik-hit kii bhaavana chhipi hoti he
 Augburn and Nimkoff have said that progress means change for good
 isliye pragati icchit parivartan he
 Through this, we want to achieve pre-determined goals
 makiver evam pej aagaah karte hue kaha he ki ham logon ko udvikas or pragati ko ek hi arth main prayog nahin karnaa chahie
 Both are completely different concepts
 jis prakaar udvikas ke arth bahut spasht evam nishchit nahin hai, vikaas kii avadharana bhi bahut spasht nahin he
 In a sociological perspective, development means social development
 praarambhik samajashastriyon visheshkar kunt, spencer evam hobahouse ne 'saamaajik udvikas', 'pragati', evam 'saamaajik vikaas' ko ek hi arth main prayog kiya tha
 Modern sociologists use these words only in a particular sense
 aaj samajashaastra ke kshe tra main vikaas se hamaara taatpary mukhyatah saamaajik vikaas se he
 It is used to clarify the difference between developed and developing countries especially due to industrialization and modernization
 saamaajik vikaas main aarthik vikaas kaa bhi bhav chipa hota he or usee ke tahat ham paramparaagat samaaj, sankramanshil samaaj evam aadhunik samaaj kii charchaa karte hai
 The development of modern education is also a type of social development
 usee tarah se krishi par aadhaarit saamaajik vyavastha se udyog par aadhaarit saamaajik vyavastha kii ore agrasar hona bhi saamaajik vikaas kaha jayega
 In other words, moving from feudalism to capitalism is also a kind of development
 saamaajik aandolan saamaajik parivartan kaa ek bahut pramukh kaarak rahaa he
 Especially in the conservative society, there have been many changes through social movements
 gidence ke anusaar samuhik aandolan vyaktiyon kaa aisa prayaas he jiskaa ek saamaanya uddeshy hota he or uddeshy kii purti ke liye sansthagat saamaajik niyamon kaa sahaara na lekar log apane dhang se vyavasthit hokar kisi paramparaagat vyavastha ko badalane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Giddens has said that sometimes it seems that social movements and formal organizations are the same things, but the two are completely different
 saamaajik aandolan ke antargat naukarshahi vyavastha jaise niyam nahin hote, jabaki aupchaarik vyavastha ke antargat naukarshahi niyam-kanoon kii adhikta hoti he
 Not only this, there is also a difference of objectives between the two
 usee tarah se kabir panth, arya samaaj, bahmo samaaj yaa haal kaa pichhadaa varg aandolan ko saamaajik aandolan kaha ja saktaa he
 No formal arrangement
 saamaajik aandolan se bhi zyada saamaajik parivartan kaa shashakt madhyam kranti he
 Countless examples of social change exist through the revolution
 lekin pichhali do-teen shatabdiyon main maanav itihaas main kaaphi, badi-badi krantiyaan ai hai, jisase kuch rashtron main raajnneetik, aarthik or saamaajik kshetron main ugantakaari parivartan hue hai
 In this context, the American Revolution of 1775–83 and the French Revolution of 1789 are particularly notable
 in krantiyon ke chalate aaj samast vishwa main swatantraaa, saamaajik samanta or prajatantr kii baat kii jaati he
 In the same way, the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Revolution have their own importance on the world stage
 abrams ne bataaya he ki vishwa main adhikansh krantiyaan moulik saamaajik punarniman ke liye hui hai
 According to Arend, the main purpose of revolutions is to separate oneself from the traditional system and to build a new society
 itihaas main kabhi-kabhi iskaa apwaad bhi dekhne ko miltaa he
 There have been some revolutions through which we try to take the society to even more ancient times
 dabaan necropolis upree misr main thebs ke vipareet, nil nadi ke pashchimi tat par ek necropolis he
 It was used for ritual burials for the Pharaonic period, especially during the New Kingdom
 proteomix jeev-shariron kii koshikaon main paae jane vaale proteinon ke adhyayan se sambandhi vigyaan he
 In this, proteins are analyzed at different stages, at the same time, and at a rapid speed
 isse koshikaon main proteinon kii antahsthioti kaa maanchitr taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Organisms have many types of proteins in the body
 proteinon main amino amlon kii lambi shrunkhlaayein hotin hai, tathaa ve 20 vibhinn amino amlon dwaara nirmit hotin hai
 The chemical properties of each amino acid are different, and their sequence in different proteins is also different
 iske kaaran prayek protein ek vishesh rup se sanrachit hota he or yah sanrachana uske dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary ke liye har prakaar se upyukt hoti he
 Proteins are directly responsible for an organism's lifespan and cellular function
 jeev vigyaan main jin or jinom kaa mahatv kisi bhawan kii neenv kii tarah hota he
 Therefore, the information provided by the Genome Project is very important
 proteomix vidhi main hui pragati se hamen yah jaanane main sahaayta milegi ki kis prakaar vibhinn rog utpann hote hai tathaa kis prakaar inke viruddh kaary karne ke liye nai aushadhiyon kaa nirmaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus proteomics is used to identify proteins related to a disease, which we call "disease indicators"
 cancer, hriday rog aadi rogon ko samajhnaa, tathaa kisi poshan str kaa adhyayan karne ke liebhi proteomix kaa baari upyog hota he
 Proteomics method in botany has been seen to be useful in describing traits of a plant and species, estimating genetic variation in one type of plant, and identifying proteins affected by environmental stresses
 atan bhavishya main proteomix se jeev vigyaan anusandhan ko ek nai disha praapt hogi or maanav rog sambandhit anusandhan main use ek prabhaavshaalee sthaan praapt hoga

 saanchaa:nationalism sidebar Nationalism is a complex, multidimensional concept that incorporates a common communal identity from its nation
 yah ek raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke rup main abhivyakt hota he, jo kisi samooh ke liye aitihaasik mahatv vaale kisi kshetra par sampradayik swaittata, or kabhi-kabhi samprabhutaa hasil karne or banaae rakhane kii ore unmukh hai
 Additionally, it is further oriented towards the development and maintenance of a common communal identity based on common characteristics, which usually include culture, language, religion, political goals and / or a belief in common ancestry
 ek vyakti kii raashtra ke bheetar sadsyta, or sambandhit rashtrawaad kaa uskaa samarthan, uske sahagaami rashtriya pahchaan dwaara chitrit hota hai
 From a political or sociological point of view, there are about three main modalities to understand the origins and basis of nationalism
 pehali, jo vaikalpik rup se aadimavad yaa sthayitvvaad jaani jaati hai, ek drushtikon he jo rashtrawaad ko ek prakritik drugvishay ke rup main varnit karata he
 This view holds that although the formal treatise of the concept of nationhood is modern, nations have always existed
 duusari roopavali sanjatipratikwaad kii he jo ek jatil drushtikon hai jo, rashtrawaad ko puure itihaas main ek gatyaatmak, utkrantikari drugvishay ke rup main prasangeekrut karke, or ek samuhik raashtra ke, aitihaasik arth se otprot rashtriya pratikon se, vyaktiparak sambandhon ke ek parinaam ke rup main rashtrawaad kii taaqat kaa aage parikshan karke, rashtrawaad ko samajhane kaa prayaas karata hai
 The third, and most dominating model, is modernism, which describes nationalism as a recent vision that requires the structural conditions of modern society to exist
 kya gathit karata hai ek raashtra ko, iske liye kai paribhaashaayen hai, haalaanki, jo rashtrawaad kii anek vibhinn kismon kii ore le jaati hai
 It may be the belief that citizenship in a state should be confined to a single ethnic, cultural, religious or identity group, or it may be that multinationalism in a single state necessarily involves the articulation of national identity even by minorities and The right to use must be included
 The adoption of national identity in terms of historical development has commonly been the result of a response by influential groups unsatisfied with traditional identities due to inconsistency between their defined social order and the experience of that social order by its members, resulting in a situation of anomie that nationalists seek to resolve
 This anomie results in a society or societies reinterpreting identity, retaining elements that are deemed acceptable and removing elements deemed unacceptable, in order to create a unified community
 This development may be the result of internal structural issues or the result of resentment by an existing group or groups towards other communities, especially foreign powers that are or are deemed to be controlling them
 The national flag, the national anthem and other symbols of national identity are generally regarded as highly important symbols of the national community
 rashtrawaad logon ke kisi samooh kii us aasthaa kaa naam he jiske tahat ve khud ko saajha itihaas, parampara, bhashaa, jaateeyata or samskruti ke aadhaar par ekajute maanate hai
 It is because of these bonds that they come to the conclusion that they have the basis to establish their sovereign political community i
e
 'nation' on the basis of self-judgment
 rashtrawaad ke aadhaar par bana raashtra us samay tak kalpanaaon main hi rahata he jab tak use ek raashtra-rajya kaa rup nahin de diya jaataa
 Although there is no nation in the world that fits these criteria perfectly, if the Atlas of the world is seen, every inch of the earth will get divided between the boundaries of the nations
 rashtrawaad kaa udai attharahavin or unnisvin sadi ke europe main hua tha, lekin apane sirf do-dhai sau saal puraane gyaat itihaas ke baad bhi yah vichaar behad shaktishaalee or tikaoo sabit hua he
 People living within national boundaries find the existence of their nation to be natural, ancient, eternal and stable
 is vichaar kii takat kaa andaaza is hakeekat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki iske aadhaar par bane rashtriya samudaay vargeey, jatigat or dharmik vibhaajanon ko bhi laangh jate hai
 According to the program and political project based on nationalism, when a nation-state is established, those in its borders are expected to give importance to the nation's allegiance over its various identities
 ve raashtra ke kanoon kaa paalan karenge or uski aantarik or bahya suraksha ke liye apane praanon kaa balidaan bhi de denge
 It is necessary to make it clear here that despite many similarities between them, there is a difference between nationalism and patriotism
 rashtrawaad anivaary taur par kisi na kisi kaarykram or pariyojna kaa vaahak hota he, jabaki deshbhakti kii bhaavana aisi kisi shart kii mohataaj nahin he
 Critics of nationalism are not lacking, nor are the arguments of those rejecting it less influential
 ek mahakhyaan ke taur par rashtrawaad choti pahachaanon ko dabaa kar prishthbhumi main dhakel detaa he
 During the nationalist movement against the British, celebrities like Rabindranath Thakur used to view this idea with suspicion
 par dilchaspee kaa vishay to yah he ki rashtrawaad ke zyaadaatar aalochak raashtra kii seemaa main rahane ke liye hi vivash nahin hai, par unamem se kai hastiyaan kisi na kisi raashtra kii sthapana main yogadan karte hue nazar aati hai
 Nationalism also assimilates various ideologies
 bharat ke udhaaharan par gaur karne se saafe ho jaataa he ki kis prakaar aadhuniktaavaadi jawaharlal nehru, marxvaadi krishna menon, udyogvadavirohi mahatma gandhi or isi tarah kai tarah kii vichaardhaaraon ke pairokaron ne mil kar bhartiya rashtrawaad kaa nirmaan kiya he
 The question of nationalism has many theoretical implications
 masalan, rashtrawaad or aadhunik samskruti va poonjeewaad kaa aapasi sambandh kya he? pashchimi or purvi rashtrawaad ke bich kya fark he? ek raajnneetik parighatna ke taur par rashtrawaad pragatisheel he yaa pratigaami? haalaanki dharm ko raashtra ke buniyadi aadhaar ke taur par manyata praapt nahin he, phir bhi bhashaa ke saath-saath dharm ke aadhaar par bhi rashtron kii rachana hoti he
 The question is why do these factors fail to keep the nations united? How can cultural and political nationalism be understood differently? It is not easy to answer these questions, because there is no systematic and thorough study of nationalism as a principle in political science
 vibhinn rashtrawadon kaa paristhitijanya charitra bhi in jatiltaaon ko badhaata he
 It can be said that apart from the understanding mentioned above, there is no universal theory of nationalism which is recognized by all the parties
 marxvad bhi rashtrawaad se sambandhit siddhant muhaiyaa karaane main naakaam rahaa he
 Marx and Engels, who gave the slogan of workers all over the world, believed that there is no country of workers
 apane lekhan main unhone varg- vibhaajan ke pare ja kar raajnneetik-saamaajik or saanskrithik ekta karne vaali kisi parighatna ko tarjeeh nahin di
 His blasphemous view of some national conflicts of his era was that he was doomed to perish
 rashtrawaad kaa koi mukammal siddhant dene ke bajaay unki rachanaayen apane yug kii vyaavhaarik raajnneeti ke tahat rashtriya prashn par vichaar karti hai
 There was a lot of debate on nationalism in the second and third international
 lenin ne ek vishaal bahujaateey samrajya main kranti karne kii samasyaon se jujhate hue raajnneetik loktantr kii aavashyaktaa ko apane rashtrawaad sambandhi vishleshan ke centre main rakhaa
 He concluded that nations should have the right to self-determination
 iske baad stallin kii vikhyath rachana marxizam and naishanal queshchan saamne aayi jisamen unhone rashtrawaad kii thiyari dene kii koshish kii
 Stalin explained the five main elements of the nation: a stable and sustainable community, a separate land area, common language, economic compatibility and collective character
 chunki stallin rashtron ke ubhaar ko udyogikaran kii zaruuraton se jod kar dekh rahe the isliye unka siddhant rashtrawaad kii aitihaasik prishthbhumi or usase ubharne vaale bahut se prashnon kii upeksha kar detaa tha
 Overall, Marxists continue to believe that nationalism has emerged as its ally in the development of capitalism
 is lihaaz se use ek burjwa vichaardhaara kii shrenee main rakhaa janaa chahie
 Nationalism unites the dominating classes to create a false sense of political community so that the common people continue to realize unity with the rich class despite the undue exploitation and impoverishment by the capitalists
 marxvaadi vimarsh kaa ek virodhabhas yah he ki rashtrawaad ko poonjeewaadi varg kii vichaardhaara maanane ke baad bhi krantikari raajnneeti ke dharaatal par kai communist partiyon ne rashtrawaad ko apni golbandi kaa aadhaar banaaya he
 Nationalist sentiments have also been used to create a socialist society after the revolution
 sattar ke dashak main horess bi
 davis ne marxvaadi tarkon kaa saar-sankalan karte hue rashtrawaad ke ek rup ko gyanoday se jod kar buddhisangat qaraar diya or duusare rup ko samskruti or parampara se jod kar bhaavnaatmak bataaya
 However, Davis too did not give more importance to nationalism than a tool and said that killing with hammer can be done and construction too
 rashtrawaad ke zariye jab utpeedit samudaay apni azaadi ke liye sangharsh karte hai to vah ek sakaaratmak naitik shakti ban jaataa he or jab raashtra ke naam par akraman kii karrwai kii jaati he to uskaa naitik bachaav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The most dazzling of all Marxist interpretations of nationalism is that of the 'notional community' propounded by Thierry Benedict Anderson
 anderson kaa mukhya sarokaar yah he ki ek-duusare se kabhi na milane vaale or ek-duusare se puri tarah aparichit log rashtriya ekta main kis tarah bandhe rahete hai
 Actually, all interpretations related to nationalism get complicated after walking a little distance
 inamen ek pramukh vyakhya yah he ki aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya rashtrawaad ke zariye khud ko zamin par utaarti he
 In this way, nationalism emerges as the 'religion of modernization'
 aadhuniktaa ke kaaran saamaajik jivan main aayi jabardast aarthik or raajnneetik uthal-puthal ke bich rashtrawaad ke zariye hi vyakti ek asmita or sansakti ke sutara hasil kar paaya
 On the other hand, it is also a reality that nationalism has at times proved to be a force preventing or limiting modernization
 rashtravaadi daleelon ke aadhaar par hi aise kai vyapaar samjhauton kaa virodh kiya jaataa he jinase rashtriya udyogikaran or aarthik samruddhi kii prakriya ko gati mil sakati he
 Religious versions of nationalism slow down the process of secularization if it is not completely stopped
 duusare, teesri duniya ke adhiktar deshon main rashtrawaad kareeb aadhi sadi biit jane ke baad bhi udyogikaran or khetihar arthvyavastha kii jaddojahad main fasaa hua he
 While comparing Western and Eastern nationalisms, some scholars have described Eastern nationalism as a victim of the lack of healthy values of Western nationalism
 kuch vidwaan pashchimi rashtrawaad ko raajnneetik or purvi rashtrawaad ko saanskrithik kii shrenee main rakhte hai
 Contrary to these assumptions, some other scholars offer the opposite belief: European nationalism is far more cultural because of its departure from an indigenous historical process, whereas Eastern nationalism is essentially political due to being fabricated by anti-colonial political movements
 duusare, agar teesri duniya ke deshon ke rashtrawaad par prajateey, jaateey or saanskrithik pahalu haaavee hai to unke peeche upniveshwaad kii bhoomika he jisaki zimmedaari pashchim par hi daali jaani chahie
 The colonialists arbitrarily ignored local ethnicities, causing many tribes and ethnic communities in Africa to split into two conflict nations
 tisare, bharat samet aise kai samaaj hai jo parmparik rup se saanskrithik, dharmik or bhashaai vividhta se sampann hai
 The experience of nationalism in such societies is bound to be different from the Western experience
 aisi paristhitiyon main kabhi to rashtrawaad bahultaaon ke bich paraspar sansakti ke sutara kaa kaam karata he or kabhi uparashtriyataon ke bich hinsak sangharsh or pratiyogita main fas jaataa he
 Fans of Western nationalism reject the importance of Eastern nationalism by dismissing some aspects of it as irrational
 lekin kuch vidwaanon ne dhyaan dilaayaa he ki is tarah ke tatva pashchimi rashtrawaad main bhi nirnaayak rup se maujuud hai
 For example, if the Indian nationalists had once been inspired to worship Kali Devi, the Romani nationalists of Europe have also been inspired by similar collectivist, violent and spiritual dimensions
 pashchim ke rashtrawaad ko udaar, samajhadaar or sarvadeshik sabit karnaa ek vyaakhyaatmak adarsh kii uplabdhi to kara saktaa he, par vyaavhaarik rup se aisa nahin he
 Whether it is Western nationalism or Eastern nationalism, both cultural and political nationalism compete with each other and reinforce each other
 bhoomandaleekaran kii prakriya ne rashtrawaad ko jabardast chunauti di he
 After the last two decades of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty-first century it can be said that at least the sovereign of the world speaks the same language, makes the same trips, eats the same food
 uske liye rashtriya simaaon ke koi khaas myne nahin rah gayi hai
 Apart from this, technological globalization like economic globalization, mass movement of people, internet and mobile phones have greatly reduced the distances in the world
 aise logon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he jo apane desh or saanskrithik maahaul se dur kaam or jivan kii sarthakata kii talash main janaa chaahate hai
 The land of Europe gave rise to nationalism and now the rise of the European Union is reducing the importance of nationalism
 is nayi paristhiti main kuch vidwaan kehane lage hai ki jin takaton ne kabhi rashtrawaad ko majboot kiya tha, ve hi uske patan kaa kaaran banane vaali hai
 Economic and political alliances that go beyond nations rather than national structures will dominate the coming centuries
 in daavon main sachai to he, lekin keval aanshik kism kii
 Nationalism as a political force remains decisive even today
 purv main chal rahe saanskrithik punarutthanavaadee andolan, duniya bhar main ho rahi nasl or avrajan sambandhi bahes or pashchim kaa bipio sambandhi vivaad iskaa pramaan he
 The movement of national self-determination by the Palestinians continues even today
 east timur indonesia se haal hi main azaad ho kar alag raashtra bana he
 The process of globalization has made the dominance of nationalism somewhat questionable, but the fact that nationalism has been victimized by poverty and backwardness in alliance with the liberal and democratic state cannot be denied
 Can go sabhi uttar-aupniveshik samaajon ne apane vaikasik lakshyon ko vedhane ke liye rashtrawaad kaa sahaara liya he
 In particular, nationalism has been a major factor in developing pluralistic societies like India into a political community

 operent condishning vyavhaar ke prati samvedansheel he, yaa uske parinaamon ke dwaara niyantrit he, jisamen ek seekhney kii prakriya he
 For example, a child can learn to avoid touching a hot stove or to open a box to get candy inside
 In contrast, classical conditioning causes a motivation to signal a positive or negative outcome; The resulting behavior does not produce the result
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek rangeen aavaran kii drushti se ek bachche kaa raal nikaalnaa yaa ek darwaja slam kii aawaaj se ek bachche kaa kaanpana,jis se gusse main mata pita sanket karte he
 Sometimes played an important role in learning conditioning, first studied by Edward L
 Thorndick, who observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from the largely homemade puzzle boxes
 ek billi is tarah ke ek rassi khinch yaa ek pole dhakelne ke rup main ek saral pratikriya se box se batch saktaa he, lekin pehali baar vivash jab billiyon baahar nikalne ke liye ek lanbaa samay laga
 
 baar-baar pareekshan ke saath aprabhavi pratikriyaaon kam baar hua or safal pratikriyaaon adhik baar hua he, to billiyon adhik se adhik teji se bhaag nikle
 Thorndick generalizes this conclusion in his law of influence which states that behaviors followed by satisfactory results become repetitive and that those producing unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated
 sankshep main, kuch parinaam vyavhaar ko majboot banane or kuch parinaam vyavhaar kamjor
 Thorndick of plotting the escape time against test number produced curves by learning the first known animal through this process

 a behavior after which a soothing stimulus is associated is more likely to occur repeatedly, but it is less likely to occur if the other behavior is associated with a punitive stimulus
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek balak ke kisi vyavhaar ko agar ek muskaraahat dwaara pratikriya di jaae to us balak dwaara vah vyavhaar punah karne kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 But if there is an angry response to such behavior, then the chances of showing that behavior again are reduced
 udhaaharan ke liye, skinner ke anusaar ek bachche ke andar uske vaataavaran main upasthit anubhavon ke aadhaar par sharmaane kaa vyavhaar viksit ho saktaa he agar vaataavaran ko punah sthapit kar diya jaae to baccha saamaajik taur par kushal ho saktaa he

 In general terms, comparative public administration means to compare the structure and functionalities of two or more administrative units
 isamen do yaa do se adhik deshon, praanton tathaa sthanon kii prashasnic vyavasthaaon ke madhya tulana kii jaati he
 The approach of comparative public administration first came up in the new article 'the Study of Administration' by Woodrow Wilson
 is lekh main wilson ne lok-prashasan ke tulanaatmak adhyayan par bal diya
 Comparative public administration is a new concept in the field of public administration studies
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke pashchaat saamaajik vigyaanon ne adhyayan ke liye tulanaatmak aadhaar par vishesh bal diya
 At the same time, scholars were trying to put social scriptures in the category of science
 lok prashasan main san 1952 main princeton main yojit ‘tulanaatmak prashasan sammelan‘ dwaara tulanaatmak drushtikon kaa pratham prayaas kiya gaya tha
 But Robert A
 Dahal said that unless the study of public administration is comparative, its claim to be science is hollow
 tulanaatmak lok prashasan ke vikaas main fairal hadi, dwide waldo, richard gabal, fred rigs, jon montagumri aadi vidwaanon kaa mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Public administration scholars began to emphasize comparative analysis
 prashasan kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan unke saamaajik, saanskrithik, raajnneetik tathaa aarthik paryaavaran ke sandarbh main kiya janaa chahie
 Comparative public administration is a new concept in which an attempt is made to make administration more scientific by comparative study of various administrative systems
 teesri duniya ke deshon ke prashasano kaa adhyayan vyapak paimaane par karne par yah gyaat hua ki in deshon kii vikaas prakriya swadeshi na hokar videshon kii nakal-maatr he yah dekha gaya he ki vikasshil deshon kii naukarshahi aupchaariktaaon evam laal fitaashahee ko anaavashyak mahatv detii he
 Also, the behavior of the administrators of these countries towards the public is not like the servant but like the owners
 in deshon kii naukarshahi main vikaas kaaryakramon ko puraa karne ke liye daksh evam yogya prashaskon kaa bhi abhaav he
 In these countries, the behavior of politicians is similar to that of administrators, while administrators are stuck in the cycle of politics

 The 'comparative Administration Group' was established in 1963 by the 'american Society for Public Administration'
 iskaa vittiya bhaar ‘ford foundation’ ne vahan kiya

 Richard Gable then took over the reins
 yah dal anterrashtriya str par karyrat tha is dal kaa pramukh kaary asia, europe va latin america main tulanaatmak prashasan par anusandhan karnaa tathaa vikaas prashasan ko protsaahan dena tha
 The team developed an 'ecological study or approach' under public administration based on its studies
 paristhitikeey drushtikon kii manyatanusaar lok prashasan vibhinn prakaar kii saamaajik paristhitiyon ke madhya karyrat rahata he tathaa swayan ko un paristhitiyon ke anukool dhaalane kii kshamta rakhata he
 The Comparative Public Administration Team made several recommendations regarding 'development Administration'
 nimrod reggli ne mukhya rup se do tathyon par bal diya- ‘siddhanth nirmaan’ evam ‘vikaas prashasan’
 Most of the work of 'theory building' in comparative public administration is related to development
 iske vipareet vikaas prashasan kaa adhikansh kaary siddhanth nirmaan se judaa he
 According to the comparative administration group, the system of comparative public administration, the principle of public administration that is applied to diverse cultures and national environments and compiles and examines data on the basis of facts
 fairal hadi ke anusaar, “tulanaatmak lok prashasan siddhanth nirmaan kii prakriya ke samaan he
 " fred rigs ke anusaar, “vaastavik tulanaatmak adhyayan vah he jo anubhav sambandhi, nomothetic tathaa paristhitikeey ho
 " nimrod rafeli ke anusaar, “tulanaatmak lok prashasan tulanaatmak aadhaar par lok prashasan kaa adhyayan he
 " haaron e
 khan ke anusaar, “tulanaatmak lok prashasan se abhipraay he ki isamen vibhinn deshon ke lok prashasan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 " tulanaatmak lok prashasan prashasnic vyavasthaaon kaa vishleshan karke hamaare gyaan ko ekatrit, vyavasthit va vistrut karata he
 Its main objectives are- vishisht prashasnic sanrachanaon tathaa pranaaliyon kaa adhyayan karke saamaanya niyamon tathaa siddhanton kaa nirmaan karnaa
 To analyze and interpret various cultures, nations, systems
 vibhinn prashasnic pranaaliyon va paddatiyon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kar unki safaltaaon evam asafalataaon ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagaana
 Familiarity with the world's administrative systems derived from comparative studies
 vikasshil deshon main nayi-nayi pravidhiyon ke prayog ko badhaava dena
 Broadening the horizons of public administration studies, practical and scientific
 tulanaatmak lok prashasan main vibhinn rajyon kii saarvajanik prashasnic sansthaaon kaa vibhinn samskritiyon ke sandarbh main tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Fairl Heady divided the nature of comparative public administration into four forms - sudhari hui parsparik prakruti- isamen vibhinn prashasnic sansthaaon tathaa sanghathanon ke madhya tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he tathaa vishleshan kar nishkarsh praapt kiye jate he
 Evolutionary nature - In this format a comparative study of the problems arising due to socio-economic development is done
 saamaanya pranali kaa praaroop- saamaanya pranali ke praaroop se taatpary yah he ki saamaajik vaataavaran ke anuroop prashasan tantra sanchalit hota he
 Therefore, such a format should be made according to the social environment that can be applied to the administration
 madhyavarti siddhanton kaa praaroop- madhyavarti siddhanton ke praaroop se taatpary un siddhanton se hai jinhen sabhi pakshon par vyaavhaarik rup se lagu kiye ja sakate he tathaa jinka vishleshnatmak pareekshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Robert T
 Golam Buesky has described three themes of comparative public administration - rigs ne 1962 main prakashit apane ek lekh “lok prashasan ke tulanaatmak adhyayan kii pravritiyaan ” main kaha he ki lok prashasan ke tulanaatmak adhyayan main teen pravritiyaan dekhi ja sakati he - Idealistic studies refer to those studies in which principles or rules are given more importance rather than conditions which are actually in front of us and affect administration more
 yah ‘kya hona chahie‘ par adhik jor detaa he tathaa samast vishleshan isi par kendrit hota he
 Empirical Studies - The behavioral movement emphasized the reality in all social sciences, including public administration, which considers human behavior important
 yah prashasnic anusandhan main anubhav par vishesh bal detaa he
 Empirical studies attempt to understand administrative reality and focus more on "what is" rather than "what should be"
 rigs kaa mat he ki, “shaniah shaniah tulanaatmak lok prashasan ke adhyayan apane parsparik aadarshatmak swaroop ko tyaag kar anubhav sambandhi visheshtaayen grahan kar rahe he
 " idiographic adhyayan - is adhyayan main kisi ek sanghathan, ek prashasnic samasya, ek vishesh aitihaasik ghatana, ek sanstha, ek raashta, ek saanskrithik kshetra yaa ek vishesh jeevani kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In fact, these studies are characterized by specificity and narrowness
 nomothetic adhyayan - isamen samanyikarnon tathaa pariklpanaaon ke nirmaan kaa praytn kiya jaataa he jisamen vyavhaar kii niyamittaaon evam ghatakon ke sahasambandhon ko pratipaadit karte he
 In nomothetic studies the emphasis is on theory building based on in-depth comparative analysis
 “idiographic” tathaa “nomothetic” dono shabd rigs dwaara rachit he tathaa rigs ke anusaar tulanaatmak lok prashasan “idiographic” swaroop chhodkar “nomothetic” rup grahan kar rahe he
 non-ecological Studies - In this the analysis of administrative institutions in terms of social, economic, political, cultural and geographical environment affecting public administration is minimized
 atah is adhyayan main prashasan kaa paryaavaran par prabhaav tathaa paryaavaran kaa prashasan par padane vaale prabhaav kaa vishleshan bahut kam kiya jaataa he
 Ecological Studies - Public administration is not only influenced by the social nature, social values, political conditions, historical context, economic condition and traditions around them, but administration also affects all these social, economic, political and cultural factors
 atah prashasnic sansthaaon kaa adhyayan bina paristhitikeey sandarbh ke nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Riggs has laid special emphasis on understanding the ecological context in comparative public administration studies
 tulanaatmak lok prashasan tulanaatmak aadhaar par lok prashasan kaa adhyayan he
 a comparative approach has been adopted to study public administration and administrative systems
 saamanytah tulanaatmak lok prashasan ke adhyayan kshetra ko teen staron main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he - In this, comparative study of the entire administrative system of one country is done with the entire administrative system of another country
 yah adhyayan dono deshon ke paryaavaran ke uchit sandarbh main kiya jaataa he, jaise - america kii prashasnic vyavastha kaa france kii prashasnic vyavastha ke saath yaa bharat kii prashasnic vyavastha kaa britain ke saath tulanaatmak vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 This study is done in the context of economic, social, and cultural environment
 tulanaatmak lok prashasan kaa yah vistrut evam vyapak kshetra he
 Under the intermediate area of administration, any important part or organ is compared which is neither very large nor very subtle in size and area
 in adhyayanon main do deshon ke prashasan ke kisi ek bhaag yaa ang kii tulana kii jaati he, jaise - bharat kii naukarshahi kii tulana brit ne kii naukarshahi se karnaa yaa america ke sthaneey prashasan kii tulana bharat ke sthaneey prashasan se karnaa
 In this, a very large part of the administration is compared with the same level of administrative system of another country
