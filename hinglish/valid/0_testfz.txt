 In an environment of economic instability, every investor will want to maximize his wealth at the lowest risk and maximum return rate by choosing the optimal investment and financial opportunities
 chuki prabandhan hi viniojakon ke prati uttaradaayi he isliye vyapaarik vittiya prabandhan kaa uddeshy hona chahie ki vah aisa nivesh or vittiya nirnay le jo sabhi niveshkon ko santusht kar anukultam vittiya sthiti ke samaan str par laa sake

 Since the management is responsible to the employers, each employer maximizes his funds at the minimum risk and maximum return rate by choosing favorable investment and financial opportunities
 yahaan par yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki niveshak is baat kaa hi khyaal rakhata ki use laabh ke saath saath dhan nirmaan ke bhi avasar milen
 Investors readily accept the risk-based income nature of investments, but each person's views on risk may vary

 jo hamase kam sampann hai, unki sadaiv madad karnaa chahie
 In Zarathosti religion, death is considered a temporary victory of evil
 iske baad mritak kii aatma kaa insaaf hoga
 If she is virtuous, then she will be inhabited by joy and light, and if misdemeanor, she will go into the depths of darkness and despair, but this state of vicious soul is also temporary
 aakhir jarathosti dharm vishwa kaa antim uddeshy achchhai kii jeet ko maanata he, buraai kii sajaa ko nahin
 Hence it is believed that eventually many liberators will come and complete the victory of good over evil

 Then the spirits will have the final say
 iske baad bhautik sharir kaa punarotthana hoga tathaa uskaa apni aatma ke saath punarmilan hoga

 yuvakon kii manoranjan sanstha - gotul kaa gondon ke jivan par bahut prabhaav he
 The unmarried youth of the village build a big house away from the township
 jahaan ve raatri main naachte, gaate or sote hai; ek aisa hi ghar avivaahit yuvatiyaan bhi taiyaar karti hai
 The Maria Gonds of Bastar have a single room of unmarried youths and young women dancing together
 gond khetihar hai or parampara se dahia kheti karte hai jo jangal ko jalaakar uski raakh main kii jaati he or jab ek sthaan kii urvartaa tathaa jangal samaapt ho jaataa he tab vahaan se hatakar duusare sthaan ko chun lete hai
 But due to government prohibition this practice has become very less
 samast gaanv kii bhoomi samudaay kii sapatti hoti he or kheti ke liye vyaktigat pariwaron ko aavashyaktaanusaar di jaati he
 Due to ban on dahiya cultivation and population pressure, many groups had to come to the outer areas and plains
 kintu vanpriya hone ke kaaran gond samooh shuru se kheti kii upjau jameen kii ore aakrisht na ho sake or dhire dhire bahari logon ne inke ilaakon kii krishiyogy bhoomi par sahmatipurna adhikaar kar liya
 From this point of view, there are four major sub-castes of Gonds: one is those who have become ordinary farmers and landowners, such as: Rajagond, Raghuval, Dadway and Katulya Gond duusare ve hai jo mili jule gaanvon main khet mazdooron, bhaad jhonkne, pashu charaane or palki dhone jaise sevak jatiyon ke kaam karte hai
 The Gond region is also known as Gondwana where the rule of the Gond dynasties was established between the 15th and 17th centuries
 kintu gondon kii chhitput aabaadi samast madhyapradesh main he
 There are between 2 and 4 lakh Gonds in each of the states of Orissa, Andhra and Bihar
 assam ke chaay bagichonvaale kshetra main 50 hajaar se adhik gond aabaad hai
 Apart from these, some areas of Maharashtra and Rajasthan are also inhabited by Gonds
 gondon kii kul aabaadi 30 se 40 lakh ke bich aanki jaati he, yadhyapi san 1941 kii janaganana ke anusaar yah sankhya 25 lakh he
 The reason for this is that many Gond castes count themselves among Hindu castes
 bengal, bihar or uttar pradesh ke dakshini bhaagon main bhi kuch gond jatiyaan hai jo hindu samaaj kaa ang ban gai hai
 The people of the Gond tribe are divided into 12 castes
 kintu unki 50 se adhik upjatiyaan hai jinamein oonch neech kaa bhedbhaav bhi he
 In fact it is difficult to call the Gonds a tribe in pure form
 inke vibhinn samooh sabhyataa ke vibhinn staron par hai or dharm, bhashaa tathaa veshbhusha sambandhi ekta bhi unamem nahin he; na koi aisa janajatiy sanghathan he jo sab gondon ko ekta ke sutara main bandhta ho
 For example, Rajgond Samaj are Kshatriyas
 anya anek samooh gondi bhashaa tathaa puraane janajaatiy dharm ko chhod chuke hai
 Their history is very glorious
 rajgado ne hindu dharm apana liya he ar kuch ne islam ko chunaa he
 Gondo has an important place among the tribes of India mainly because of their history
 15veen se 17veen shatabdi ke bich gondvanaa main anek gond rajwanshon kaa drudh or safal shashan sthapit tha
 These rulers built many fortified fortresses, ponds and monuments and showed successful government policy and efficiency
 inke shashan kii paridhi madhya bharat se purvi uttar pradesh or bihar tak pahunchati thi
 There were four important Gond kingdoms in the 15th century
 jisamen kherala, garh mandla, devgarh or chaandagarh pramukh the
 The city of Nagpur was founded by Gond king Bakht Buland Shah and shifted its capital from Deogarh to Nagpur
 The famous queen Durgavati of Gondwana was the queen of the Gond dynasty
 gondon kaa naam praaia: khondon ke saath liya jaataa he jaise bheelon kaa kolon ke saath
 This is probably due to their geographical proximity
 gond janajati kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitna is prithvi -grah par manushya, parantu likhit itihaas ke pramaan ke abhaav main khoj kaa vishay he
 Adi shakhas are available here in the area of ancient residence of Gond tribe
 gond samudaay dravinvarg ke maane jate he, jiname jaati vyastha nahin thi
 These dark people have been living in this country since some 5-6 thousand years ago
 ek pramaan ke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki gond janajati kaa sambandh sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa se bhi rahaa he
 The valor of Gondwana Rani Durgavati is still carried in Gondi, Halbi and Bhatri folk songs with great pride
 aaj bhi kai paaramparik utsavon main gondvanaa rajya ke kisse kahanio ko bade chaav se sunakar unke vaibhavshaalee itihaas kii parampara ko yaad kiya jaataa he
 According to ancient geography, two parts of the ancient world are known as Gondwana Land and Angara Land
 gondvanaa land adikaal se nivasarat gond janajati ke kaaran jan jaataa tha, kalantar main gond janajatiyon ne vishwa ke vibhinn hisson main apane-apane rajya viksit kiye, jiname se narmada nadi basin par sthit garmandla ek pramukh gondvanaa rajya rahaa he
 Raja Sangram Shah was one of the mighty kings of this empire, who, on the strength of his might, expanded the kingdom and built new forts

 88 generations of Mahadevas are mentioned verbally in the Gondi song, story, anecdote
 mahadevon kii 88 peedi main pratham peedi shanbhu-mula madhya peedi main shanbhu-gaura evam antim peedi main shanbhu-parvati kaa naam aata he
 Mainly Shambhu-moola, Shambhu-gonda, Shambhu-saiyya, Shambhu-ramala, Shambhu-biro, Shambhu-raya, Shambhu-anedi, Shambhu-thamma, Shambhu-gavra, Shambhu-bela, Shambhu-tulsa, Shambhu-aama, Shambhu -girja, shambhu-sati etc
 and finally mention of pair of shambhu-parvati j

 The duration of the superintendence on the Gondwana terrain of these 88 Mahadevas has been reported to be about 10,000 years ago, about 5,000 years ago
 is kaal se hi koya punem dharman kaa prachaar hua tha
 In Gondi dialect, Koya means human and Puname means religion
 aaj se hajaaron varsh purv se gond janajatiyon dwaara maanav dharman kaa paalan kiya ja rahaa he
 That is, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam in Gondi culture
 bhartiya samaaj ke nirmaan main gond samskruti kaa bahut bada yogadan rahaa he
 Indian culture stands on the foundation of Gondi culture
 gondvanaa bhubhag main nivasarat gond janajati kii adbhut chetana unki saamaajik prathaon, manovritiyon, bhaawanaaon aacharnon tathaa bhautik padaarthon ko aatmsaat karne kii kala kaa parichaayak he, jo vigyaanan par aadhaarit he
 The entire Gond community was bonded by the hill Kupar Lingo into a thread from the middle of Koya Punem
 dhaniksar naamak gond vidvan ne rasayan vigyaan avan vanaspati vigyaan kaa tathaa hira suka ne saat suron kaa parichay karaayaa tha
 The people of Gond tribes play their lives effortlessly by showing skill, they also believe in coffee superstition or
 gondi bhashaa gondvanaa samrajya kii maatrubhaasha he
 Gondi language is the mother of many indigenous languages because of its extremely five languages
 gondi dharman darshan ke anusaar gondi bhashaa kaa nirmaan aradhy dev shambhu shaike ke damru se hui he, jise goendani vaani yaa gondvani kaha jaataa he
 Being a very ancient language, Gondi language is completely complete in itself
 gondi bhashaa kii apni lipi he, vyakaran he jise samay-samay par gondi sahityakaron ne pustakon ke madhyam se prakashit kiya he
 It is very important for the descendants of the Gondwana kingdom to know their language script
 bhashaa samaaj kii maan hoti he, isliye ise "maatrubhaasha" ke rup main aadar bhi diya jaataa he
 Gondian society has its own mother tongue, Gondi, which should be stored with respect and honor as a provident
 gondo dwaara boli jane vaali bhashaa ko gondi athwa parsi kaha jaataa he
 One thing and in the Gond tribe, the Pardhan caste says there, the Pradhan Negi tribe works there to worship the deity and the Pradhan Negi has now been demolished by changing the name, but there is no denigration there

 sheetala ashtami hinduon kaa ek tyohaar he jisamen sheetala mata ke vrath or pujan kiye jate hai
 They do this in the next week after the Holi is over
 praayah sheetala devi kii puja caitra maas ke krishna paksh kii ashtami tithi se prarambh hoti he, lekin kuch sthanon par inaki puja holi ke baad padane vaale pehle somvaar athwa guuruuvaar ke din hi kii jaati he

 Neem leaves do not let the pods rot
 rogi ko thanda jal priy hota he at:kalash kaa mahatv he
 Smallpox stains erase smallpox stains
 sheetala-mandiron main praaia: mata sheetala ko gardabh par hi asin dikhaaya gaya he
 In the Skanda Purana, the hymn of their archana is received as Sheetlashtak
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is stotra kii rachana bhagwaan shankar ne lokhit main kii thi
 Sheetlashtak sings the glory of Shitala Devi, as well as motivates devotees to worship her
 shastron main bhagwati sheetala kii vandana ke liye yah mantra bataaya gaya he: Marginakashopateam surpalankritamastakam
 
 Seated on the garb, Digambara, holding a broom and an urn in my hand, i recite the forehead-decorated Bhagwati Sheetla ornamented with soup
 sheetala mata ke is vandana mantra se yah purnat:spasht ho jaataa he ki ye swatchta kii adhishthatri devi hai
 Having a hand in hand means that we too should be conscious about cleanliness
 kalash se hamaara taatpary he ki swatchta rahane par hi swasthya rupi samruddhi aati he

 hamaari prithvi or surya jis gallexi main avasthit hai, raatri main ham nangi aankh se usee gallexi ke taaraon ko dekh pate hai
 So far, there are estimated to be about 19 billion galaxies in every part of the universe that has been detected
 brahmad ke visphot siddhant ke anusaar sabhi gallexien ek duusare se badi teji se dur hatati ja rahi hai
 a hundred billion galaxies exist in the universe

 Galaxies began their lives millions of years ago and gradually regained their present form
 prayek gallexiyaan arabon taron ko ko samete hue he
 Gravity binds the stars together, and in this way many galaxies live together in a cluster of stars

 Wright refute this notion by studying the interactions of four groups of galaxies
 unhone yah bataaya ki gallexiyon ke bich main aisi visphotak antar kriyaayein nahin hoti hai jo nai gallexiyon ko janm de saken
 The center of most galaxies is a spherical part filled with stars, called the nucleus, and the nucleus is attached to a planar circular disk around it
 khagolvigyaani gallexiyon ko unke aakaar ke aadhaar par mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main vibhajit karaten he
 Nobody knows why galaxies assume a certain form
 shaayad yah gallexiyon ke ghurnan ke veg or usame sthit taron ke banane ki gati par nirbhar karata he
 The width and brightness of our Galaxy is not universal
 dhanu taramandal main yah sabase adhik chaudee or chamakili he
 When viewed from a distance, numerous stars appear in the galaxy
 vibhinn chamak ke taron kii sankhya ginakar, unki duuri kii gananaa kar or unki gati naapakar jyotishiyon ne gallexi ke vaastavik rup kaa bahut acha anumaan laga liya he
 If one considers the form of the galaxy in a three-dimensional recess instead of the one seen in the sky, then it is found that the galaxy is almost like a flat circular wheel whose part near the axis is somewhat bloated
 chitra main gallexi kaa bagal se chitra dikhaaya gaya he 
 The diameter of this wheel is about one million light years, miles or 63 thousand times the distance of the Sun from Earth) and the thickness is between 3,000 and 6,000 light years
 centre ke paas kii motaai lagbhag 15,000 prakashavarsh he
 The stars in our Galaxy are not evenly distributed
 bich bich main anek taraguchh hai or isaki bhi sambhaavna he ki devayani niharika ke samaan hamaari gallexi main bhi sarpil kundaliyaan hon
 There are microscopic dust and gases in the middle of the stars, which spoil the light of the distant stars
 dhuli or gas kaa ghanatv sanstha ke madhytal main adhik he
 Somewhere black clouds have formed due to thick cloud of dust
 kahin gas ke badal paas ke taron ke prakaash se uddipt hokar chamakati niharika ke rup main dikhaai padate hai
 The mass of our galaxy is approximately one trillion times the mass of the Sun
 isamen se praaia: aadha to taron kaa dravyaman he or aadha dhuli or gas kaa
 Our Galaxy is like a puffed circle in the middle
 isamen ek vrutt ke bheetar hi ve sab taare hai jo hamen akaash main pruthak-pruthak dikhaai padate hai
 Stars and galaxies are scattered sparsely around our galaxy
 hamaari gallexi ke centre ke paas taare sankhya main adhik ghaney hai or kinare kii ore apekshaakrit bikhare hue hai
 All the stars are rotating around the center, the stars near the center are at high speed and the far ones are at low speed
 hamaara surya centre se lagbhag 30-35 hajaar prakashavarsh dur he or gallexi ke madhya tal main hai
 For this reason, we see our galaxy like the mekhala which is described above
 prithvi se gallexi kaa centre dhanu taramandal kii ore he
 That's why it revolves around the center of the Galaxy
 is parikrama main uskaa veg 150 mile prati senkad hai
 Even at this velocity, the sun takes 200 million years in the entire orbit
 kuch teevr gativale taare or goleey targuch hamaari gallexi kii seemaa ke baahar hai, kintu ye bhi hamaari gallexi se sambhddha hai or usee ke ang maane jate hai lagbhag 100 goleey taraguchh gyaat hai
 Their distribution is spherical
 in taragucchon ke vitaran se gallexi kaa centre gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Measuring the speed of wires also helps in the calculation of the center
 rup or vistaar main gallexi bahut si agong niharikaon se milti julati hai

 Amba is described as the daughter of Kashiraj in the Mahabharata
 amba kii do or bahane thim ambika or ambalika
 Amba, Ambika and Ambalaika were about to be swayamvara
 unke swayamvar main jaakar akele hi bhishma ne vahaan aaye samast raajaaon ko parrast kar diya or teenon kanyaon kaa haran karke hastinapur le aaye jahaan unhone teenon bahanon ko satyavati ke saamne prastut kiya taaki unka vivaah hastinapur ke raja or satyavati ke putr vichitraveery ke saath sampann ho jaye
 When Amba told that she had accepted Raj Shalva as her husband, Vichitravirya refused to marry him
 bhishma ne use raja shalve ke paas bhijwa diya
 King Shalva did not accept Amba, so she returned to Hastinapur and said to Bhishma, "O Arya! You have brought me everything, so you marry me
" " kintu bhishma ne apni pratigya ke kaaran uske anurodh ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Amba was angry and said that she would cause Bhishma's death, she went to Parashurama and told him about his agony and asked for help
 parashuram ne amba se kaha, "he devi! aap chintaa na karen, main aapkaa vivaah bhishma ke saath karavaauunga
 "parashurama sent a call to Bhishma but Bhishma did not go to him
 is par krodhit hokar parashuram bhishma ke paas pahunche or donon veeron main bhayanak yuddh chhid gaya
 Both were unprecedented warriors, so the victory and victory could not be decided
 aakhir devataaon ne hastkshep kar ke is yuddh ko band karvaa diya
 Disappointed, Amba went to do penance in the forest where she did austerities to Mahadev
 mahadev uski tapasya se prasann huye or uske samaksh prakat hokar use yah var diya ki vah agle janm main bhishma kii mrityu kaa kaaran banegi
 After getting this groom, Amba took self-control and was born as Shikhandi in the house of King Drupada in the next life
 shikhandi kurukshetra ke yuddh main bhishma ke mrityu kaa kaaran bane kyonki krishna ne us din shikhandi ko arjuna kaa sarathi banaaya or kyonki bhishma ko shikhandi ke purv janm kaa gyaat tha, atev unhone ek mahila ke viruddh shastr uthaane se inkaar kar diya or isi bich arjuna ne mauka paakar bhishma par baanon kii varsha kar di jiske kaaran bhishma aahat hokar dharti par gir gayi
