 diwaar, khambhe tathaa bhawan or pulon ke aadharastambhon kaa bhaar unki neenv athwa buniyaad dwaara prithvi par vitarit kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, foundation is a very important part in construction work
 agar buniyaad kamjor ho, to puure bhawan athwa pul ke bharvaahan kii shakti bahut kam ho jaati he
 If the foundation is once weakened, then it is often impossible to improve it later
 at: buniyaad kaa abhikalp bahut dakshata se bananaa chahie
 The special purpose of the foundation is that it should distribute the load from above evenly over the land in such a way that the soil there does not have to be overburdened by its load capacity, otherwise the soil is afraid of cracking in the building etc
 neenv ke abhikalp ke liye vibhinn prakaar kii mitti athwa chattaanon kii bhardhari kshamta kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 In the following table, the load capacity of different types of soils is given - tippanee- As the depth increases from the surface of the earth, generally the load capacity of the soil will also increase with the depth
 saadhaarant: pani kii nami se mitti kii bhardhari kshamta kuch kam ho jaati he
 That is why the foundations of most buildings are kept at least three to four feet deep from the ground, due to which the effect of moisture in rain is greatly reduced at this depth
 aisi jameen kii jahaan pani bharaa rahata he, bhardhari kshamta ausat se thodi kam leni chahie
 For large buildings and bridges etc
, complete soil testing should be done by a soil testing laboratory

 If the load capacity of the ground is "C" and the total load is "bh" per foot length of the foundation, the foundation width "F" can be derived from the following equation: yah rankin ke nimnlikhit sameekaran se praapt kii ja sakati hai : This includes c = load capacity of the ground, a = the brick or stone or concrete from which the foundation will be formed, the load per square foot and q = the angle in which the soil is naturally formed
 praaia: bhavannirmaan main uparyukt sutara dwaara jo neenv kii gaharaai aegi, vah bahut thodi hogi

 Net run rate is a statistic used in the game of cricket
 ek divasiy lig pratiyogita main team ko vibhajit karne ke liye yah ek saamaanya pranali hoti he, jis prakaar footbal main "gol antar" hota he vaise hi iskaa istemaal cricket main kiya jaataa he
 In a single game, the net run rate is the run rate per over earned by the team in that match and subtracts the per over run rate scored against them
 ek team kaa ran rate unke dwaara khele gaye overon se unki kul ranon se vibhajit hota he
 There are six balls in an over, for the purpose of calculating net run rate, each ball is calculated as 1 / 6 of an over ball, although in cricket notation is usually one ball of one over
 Is treated as
 isliye agar ek team 50 overon main 250 ran kaa score karti hai to unka ran rate 250 50 = 5 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {250}{50}}=5} hoga
 agar ve 47
5 over main samaan score karte hai to unka ran rate 250 47 5 6 ≈ 5
226 { \ displaystyle { \ frac {250}{47{ \ frac {5}{6 xxrep 4 } \ approx 5
226} hoga
 The concept of net run rate involves removing the opponent's final run rate from the team's run rate
 keval ek samasya yah he ki yadi ek team ko out kar diya jaataa he or isamen saamana kii gai gendon se unke dwaara kiye gaye score ko vibhajit nahin kiya jaataa; iske bajaay over ke sampoorn kota kaa istemaal hota he 
 Typically, runs and tossed overs are calculated throughout the season to compare teams in the league table, as the following formula demonstrates - net run rate = total runs scored total overs faced − total runs conceded total overs bowled { \ displaystyle { \ mbox{net run rate }}={ \ frac { \ mbox{total runs scored}}{ \ mbox{total overs faced}}}-{ \ frac { \ mbox{total runs conceded }}{ \ mbox{total overs bowled xxrep 4 } All scenarios take the international one-day rule with 50 overs from each side's team

 According to this theory - jahaan, ħ = h / 2 π { \ displaystyle \ hbar =h / 2 \ pi }, h plank niyatank he
 This shows that both a particle of a particle and a tatangan component of its momentum cannot be known simultaneously and if the uncertainty of one of these two conjugate quantities is very low, the other is very high
 anischitata ke sambandh ek ore to kan kii sthiti kii kisi tarang se sangati sthapit karne kii sambhaavna ke niyamon ke tathaa duusari ore prayiktamulak nirvachan ke vyapak niyamon ke anivaary parinaam hai
 Heisenberg and Mohr, after a thorough and thorough analysis of the measurement process, proved that the results of any measurement cannot be counter to the uncertainty principle
 yadi ham kisi kan kii sthiti n ekadam shuddh maap len to isaki sthiti kii anischitata qn shunya baraabar hogi
 Then the uncertainty of the momentum of that particle according to the laws of mathematics: arthath aparimit ho jaaegi
 Therefore, we are bound to arrive at the simple conclusion that the moment at which we get an accurate measurement of the position of the particle, its velocity at that time becomes indefinite
 agar kisi kshankaal par kan kaa veg param yatharthata se mapa jaataa he to us kshankaal par kan kii sthiti kya thi, yah pataa lagane kaa hamaare paas vikalp nahin rahata
 In such a situation, the measurement of both position and momentum is possible only within certain uncertainties

 vidhyalay ke bare main saamaanya jaankaree is prakaar he:- Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm ek dharm he jiske anuyaayi adhikanshtah bharat ,nepal or morishas main bahumat main hai
 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent

 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he

 saanchaa:ireland kaa itihaas The Celtic civilization of Gaelic Ireland or Ireland, called the civilization of political and social order developed by the indigenous Gaelic peoples of the island of Ireland, existed on the island of Ireland from prehistoric times until the early 17th century
 is dauraan ireland anek chote-bade rajyon or jaagiron main banta hua tha, jinpar vibhinn gaile rajanon kaa raaj tha
 The society was divided into clans and, similar to the rest of Europe then, was also ranked by nobility
 norman akraman se purv, gelic samaaj kii arthvyavastha multah pashuchaaran par aadhaarit thi, or saadhaaran rup se mudra kaa upyog nahin hota tha
 During this period the traditional dress, music, dance, sports, architecture and art of the Irish people developed, which later merged with the anglo-saxon style
 16veen sadi ke antim varshon ke samay, england rajshahi ne ireland par puri tarah kabza kar liya or isi ke saath gelic ireland kaa ant ho gaya
 Prior to the Norman invasion from England in 1169, the expansion of Gaelic Ireland was across the island of Ireland
 tatpashchaat, gelic adhidesh, un bhubhaagon tak simit tha, jinpar angrezi kabza nahin tha, yaa jinpar nunatam videshi prabhaav tha
 During much of history, Ireland was divided into a series of kingdoms and fiefdoms
 inpar rajanon or saradaaron kaa raaj hua karata tha, jinhen tannistry namak prakriya se chunaa jaataa tha
 War between these states was common
 yadakada, kisi shaktishaalee va prabhaavshaalee raja ko puure ireland kaa ucchadhiraj ke rup main prapti sweekaar kiya jaataa tha
 And, so-called, society was indexed on the basis of nobility
 is kaal ke dauraan, ireland ke chaar pramukh rajya the konact, lanster, manster or ulster, joki aksar aapas main bhoomi par kabze ke liye ladaa karte the
 The primary Gaelic civilization was the polytheistic civilization, and was originally based on the Shruti tradition, writing was less prevalent, though writing by Ogham letters began in the first century BCE

 Ireland became an important center of education during this period and also contributed significantly to the flow of Christianity in Europe
 9veen sadi main viking akramanakariyon ne ireland par hamale kiye or tat ke kinare kai viking bastiyaan sthapit kii
 Over time, these people also joined the Gaelic society, and became known as norse-gael
 varsh 1169 se 71 ke bich, england se normanon ne ireland par hamalaa karnaa kiya or ireland ke kai hisson par apana kabza jamaa liya
 With the help of Norman feudal lords, the kings of England claimed the right of England over the whole island in the name of "vassals of Ireland"
 haalaanki, 17veen sadi se pehle tak angrejon ne kabhi bhi puure dweep par apana kabza nahin kiya tha, norman or gelic kabze vaala kshetra ghatate-badhate rahaa karata tha, or gelic sabhyataa gaiyr-norman kshetron main jari rahati thi
 Gradually the expansion of the Norman area began to decline and a time came when the British-occupied territory remained limited to a small area of the Pale Salt on the east coast

 Simultaneously, the British began to occupy Ireland again

 In real life, the flora and fauna comprise the fauna and in terms of flora and fauna it is called plant anatomy and fauna respectively
 jab kisi vishesh praani athwa vanaspati kii sharirarachana kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, tab ise vishesh shaaririki adhyayan kehete hai

 1,000 years before Christ, Maharishi Sushruta had adequately described the anatomy by autopsy

 The study of anatomy has become more subtle and detailed with the provision of body protection, microscopes, X-ray etc
 sharir rachana kii sabase choti ikai koshika he
 Many cells form tissues; Organs are formed from one or several types of tissues; Many organs form a system

 The body is formed by the following mechanisms: asthi tantra, Joint system, peshi tantra, Blood transport system, aashay tantra : Nervous system and gyanendriya tantra
 See body mechanism for detailed description

 There are a total of 64 cells or squares above the square, of which 32 squares are black or other colors and 32 squares are white or other colors
 khilne vaale donon khilaadi bhi saamanytah kaala or safed kehalaate hai
 Each player has a king, wazir, two camels, two horses, two elephants and eight soldiers
 bich main raja va vajeer rahata he
 Camel on the side, horse on its side and two elephants in the last row
 unki agali rekha main aath paidal yaa sainik rahete hai
 While keeping the square, it is noted that the food on the right side of both the players should be white and instead of the wazir, the black wazir should be in black squares and the white wazir should be in white squares
 khel kii shuruyaat hameshaa safed khilaadi se kii jaati he
 Chess is one of the oldest and most popular boards, played by two opponents on a square board, which consists of two different colors of custom made white and black pieces
 safed pehle chalata he, jiske baad kheladi nirdhaarit niyamon ke anusaar ek ke baad ek chaalen chalate hai
 The players then make an attempt to defeat the king, the chief of the opposition, the king
 shatranj 64 khaanon ke pat yaa shatranji par khelaa jaataa he, jo rank kahalaane vaali aath anulamb panktiyon va file kahalaane vaali aath aadi panktiyon main vyavasthit hota he

 Moves either go to an empty square or occupy an opponent's piece and remove it from the game
 khilaadi koi bhi aisi chaal nahin chal sakate jisase unka raja hamale main aa jaye
 If the player has no valid moves left, the game is over; This is either a check - if the king is under attack - or a deadlock or check - if the king is not under attack
 har shatranj kaa tukdaa badhane kii apni style he

 pyaadaa turant apane saamne ke khaali varg par aage chal saktaa he yaa apana pehla kadam yah do varg chal saktaa he yadi donon varg khaali hai
 If the opponent's piece is diagonally on an adjacent line in front of it, the pawn can occupy that piece
 pyaadaa do vishesh chaal, "en pasaant" or "padonnati-chaal " bhi chal saktaa he
 An old saying in Hindi is based on this special trick of walking - "fear the fake from pawn, go twinkle!" raja kisi bhi disha main ek khaane main ja saktaa he, raja ek vishesh chaal bhi chal saktaa he jo "caseling" kahi jaati he or isamen hathi bhi shaamil he
 If the king is forced to walk and cannot walk on any side, then assume that the game is over
 nahin chal sakane vaale raja ko khilaadi haath main lekar bolta he- 'maat' yaa 'main haar sweekaar karata hoon'
 The wazir combines the power of the elephant and the camel and can go up and down, right-left and zigzag any number of sections, but it cannot jump over other pieces
