 There are two main types of shell chemistry - jab samay bitta he, tab ghatnaayen ghatit hoti hai tathaa chalbindu sthanantarit hote hai
 Therefore, the interval between two consecutive events or the movement of a moving point from one point to another is called time
 samay naapane ke yantra ko ghadi athwa ghatiyantra kehete hai
 Thus, we can also say that time is the physical element that is measured by the Ghatyantra
 saapekshavaad ke anusaar samay digdesh ke saapeksh he
 Therefore, in this article the time-scale will be taken from the time relative to the direction generated by the Earth's motion relative to the Sun
 samay ko naapane ke liye sulabh ghatiyantra prithvi hi he, jo apane aksh tathaa kaksh main ghumkar hamen samay kaa bodh karaati he; kintu prithvi kii gati hamen drishy nahin he
 With respect to the motion of the Earth, we see two types of movements of the Sun, one is the rotation of the Earth from east to west and the other is the orbit, going from east point to north and north to south
 atev vyaavhaarik drushti se ham surya se hi kaal kaa gyaan praapt karte hai
 In order to know the inaccuracy of the constellation clock, with the help of an instrument called chronometer, by observing the sun or stars by the Yamyatra Yantra, the constellation time of their post-yamash skipping is known
 dwaara surya athwa taron kaa vedh karke, kronometer naamak yantra kii sahaayta se, unke yamyottar langhan kaa nakshatra samay jaan liya jaataa he
 Combined with the sidereal clock, the constellation time of the planetary or star piercing in the telescope of the post-mortem device is determined by pressing the chronometer switch
 is samay se yantric ashuddhiyon ko nikaal dene par jo samay praapt hota he, vahi grah yaa taare ke yamyottar ke udhrv bindu ke langhan kaa samay hota he
 If the sidereal is right, it will be equal to the equinox of the planet or star and the difference is inaccuracy of the clock
 is prakaar nakshatra ghadi ko shuddh rakhkar usase madhya surya ghadiyon ko shuddh kiya jaataa he
 There is a greater possibility of personal inaccuracy in perforation by post-mortem instrument
 isliye taron ke yamyottar langhan ke nakshatra samay ko camera lage khamadhya doordarshkon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Thus even though the mean time clocks are maintained properly, daily modifications to them were a problem
 isliye aajkal ghadiyon ke second suchak upkaran quartenj ke crystalon se banaae jate hai

 cricket ek balle or gend kaa daleey khel he jisaki shuruyaat dakshini england main hui thi
 The earliest definite reference to it is found in 1598, now it is played in more than 100 countries

 a cricket match consists of two teams of 11 players
 It is played in a field of grass, in the center of which is a flat strip of land called a pitch
 wicket lakdi se bani hoti hai, jise pich ke prayek sire main lagaaya jaataa he or uskaa prayog ek lakshya ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The bowler is a player in the fielding team who, for bowling, puts a hard, leather fist-sized 5
5 ounce cricket ball from one wicket to another, which is saved by a batsman from the opposition team
 goes
 aam taur par gend ballebaaj ke paas pahunchne se pehle ek baar tappa khaati he
 To protect his wicket the batsman play the ball with wooden cricket bat
 isi bich gendbaaj kii team ke anya sadsy maidan main kshetrarakshak ke rup main alag-alag sthitiyon main khadey rahete hai, ye khilaadi ballebaaj ko daud banane se rokane ke liye gend ko pakadaney kaa prayaas karte hai or yadi sambhav ho to use out karne kii koshish karte hai
 If the batsman is not out, he can run between the wickets and change his position from another batsman, who stands on the other side of the pitch
 is prakaar ek baar sthiti badal lene se ek ran ban jaataa he
 Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the field
 score kiye gaye ranon kii sankhya or out hone vaale khilaadiyon kii sankhya match ke parinaam ko nirdhaarit karne vaale mukhya kaarak hai
 How much time it would take for the cricket game to be over depends on several factors
 peshewar cricket main yah seemaa har paksh ke liye 20 overon se lekar 5 din khilne tak kii ho sakati he
 There are different rules depending on the duration of the game that determine the win, lose, draw, or draw in the game
 cricket mukhyatah ek bahari khel he or kuch mukaable kritrim prakaash main bhi khele jate hai
 For example, during the summer season it is played in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, while in the West Indies, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, it is mostly played in the post-monsoon winter

 The field is grassy and is prepared by a groundsman, whose work includes embarkation, cutting, rolling and leveling of the surface
 maidan kaa vyas 140â160 gaz saamaanya hota he
 The perimeter of the field is called the boundary and is sometimes colored or sometimes marked by a rope to mark the outer boundary of the field
 maidan gol, chaukor yaa andakaar ho saktaa he, cricket kaa sabase prasiddh maidan he ovel
 The objective of each team is to score more runs than the other team and dismiss all the players from the other team
 cricket main khel ko zyada ran bana kar bhi jeeta ja saktaa he, chaahe duusari team ko puri tarah se out na kiya gaya ho
 To win the game in the second form it is necessary to score more runs and dismiss the other team, otherwise the match ends without any result
 khel shuru hone se pehle donon tiimon ke captain ek sikke ko oochaal karke nirdhaarit karte hai ki koun si team pehle ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji karegi
 The captain who wins the toss makes his decision according to the pitch and the current and anticipated state of the season
 mukhya aakarshan maidan ke vishesh rup se taiyaar kiye gaye kshetra main hota he jo "pich" kehalaata he
 Both the pitch and 22 yards of wicket are taken
 ye gendbaaji urf kshetrarakshan paksh ke liye lakshya hote hai or ballebaaji paksh ke dwaara inkaa bachaav kiya jaataa he jo ran banane kii koshish main hote hai
 Originally a run is made when a batsman runs between the pitch after hitting the ball with his bat, although there are many other ways to score runs according to the description below
 yadi ballebaaj or ran banane kaa prayaas nahin karata he to gend "ded" ho jaati he or gendbaaj ke paas vaapis gendbaaji ke liye aa jaati he
 The bowling side tries to dismiss the batsmen in various ways until the batting side is "all out"
 iske baad gendbaaji vaala paksh ballebaaji karata he or ballebaaji vaala paksh gendbaaji ke liye "maidan" main aa jaataa he
 In professional matches, there are 15 people on the field during the game
 inamen se do ampire hote hai jo maidan main hone vaali gatividhiyon ko niyantrit karte hai
 There are two batsmen, one of them is a striker who faces the ball and the other is called a non-striker
 ballebaajon kii bhoomika ran banane ke saath or over puure hone ke saath badalati rahati he
 All 11 players in the fielding team are on the field together
 unamem se ek gendbaaj hota he, doosraa wicketiper or anya nau kshetrarakshak kehalaate hai
 The wicketkeeper is always an expert but any fielder can be called for bowling
 pich viketon ke bich kii lambaai hoti he or chaudee hoti he
 It is a flat surface, with very little grass on it which can diminish with play
 pich kii "haalat" match or team kii ranneeti par prabhaav daalati he, pich kii vartmaan or pratyaashit sthiti team kii ranneeti ko nirdhaarit karti he
 Each wicket consists of three wooden stumps which are placed in a straight line, above which are called two wooden bails crease or bowling crease or two "return" creases
 stump ko gendbaaji krij kii line main rakhaa jaataa he or inhen ek duusare se thodi duuri par rakhaa jaataa he
 The middle stump is placed exactly the length of the bowling crease at the center
 The popping crease has the same length, it is parallel to the bowling crease and is in front of the wicket
 ritern krij baaki donon ke lambavat hoti he; ye donon popping krij ke ant se judi hoti hai or inhen gendbaaji kii krij ke ant tak kam se kam isaki lambaai main chitrit kiya jaataa he
 While bowling, the bowler's hind leg must be between two return creases in his "delivery stride", while his front leg should be read above or behind the popping crease
 agar gendbaaj is niyam ko todta he, to ampire "no bal" ghoshit kar detaa he
 The importance of popping crease for a batsman is that it determines the extent of his safe zone when he is "out of this area" so he can be stumped or run out when his wicket is uprooted
 pich kii sthirataa bhinn ho sakati he jiske kaaran gendbaaj ko milane vaala oochaal, spin or gati alag alag ho sakati he
 It is easy to bat on a hard pitch, because the bounce on it is high but equal
 sukhi pich ballebaaji ke liye kharaab maani jaati he kyon kii is par daraaren aa jaati hai or jab aisa hota he to spinner ek ahm bhoomika adaa kar saktaa he
 Moist pitches or grass-covered pitches help give extra bounce to a good fast bowler
 is tarah kii pich puure mech ke dauraan tej gendbaaj kii madad karti he lekin jaise jaise mech aage badhata he ye ballebaaji ke liye or bhi behatar hoti jaati he
 The essence of the game is that a bowler bowls the ball from his side of the pitch towards the batsman who is ready to "strike" it with the bat at the other end
 balla lakdi se bana hota he iskaa aakar blade ke jaisaa hota he or sheersh par belanaakaar hendal hota he
 The blade should not exceed the width and the total length of the bat gend ek sakht chamade kaa gola hoti he jisaki paridhi gend kii kathorta jise se adhik gati se phenkaa ja saktaa he, wo ek vichaarneey mudda he or ballebaaj surakshatmak kapade pahentaa he jisamen shaamil he ped, ballebaaji ke dastaane haathon ke liye, helmet sar ke liye or ek box jo patalun ke andar pahana jaataa he or kroach kshetra ko surakshit karata he
 Some batsmen wear extra padding inside their shirts and trousers such as Thai pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads maidan par khel ko do ampire niyantrit karte hai, unamem se ek wicket ke peeche gendbaaj kii taraf khadaa rahata he or doosraa "square leg" kii sthiti main jo striking ballebaaj se kuch gaj peeche hota he
 When the bowler bowls, the wicket umpire remains between the bowler and the non-striker
 yadi khel kii sthiti par kuch andeh hota he to ampaire paraamarsh karata he or yadi aavashyak hota he to wo khilaadiyon ko field se bahaar le jaakar match ko sthagit kar saktaa he, jaise barish hone par yaa roshni kam hone par| Outside of the field and televised matches, there is often a third umpire who can decide in special situations with the help of video evidence
 test maichon or do isisi ke purna sadasyon ke bich khele jane vaale simit overon ke antarrashtriya khel main teesraa ampire jaruri hota he
 In these matches, there is also a match referee whose job is to ensure that the game is played in the spirit of the game under the rules of cricket
 maidan ke baahar do adhikarik scorer ranon or out hone vaale khilaadiyon kaa record rakhte hai, prayek adhikari ek team se hota he
 The scorers are guided by the umpire's hand signals
 udhaaharan ke liye, ampire ek tarjani anguli uthaa kar bataata he ki ballebaaj out ho gaya he; or yadi ballebaaj ne chha: ran banaae hai to wo donon haathon ko upar uthaata he
 Scorers keep records of all runs, wickets and overs as per the rules of cricket
 vyavhaar main, ve atirikt data bhi sanchit karte hai jaise gendbaaji vishleshan or ran kii daren| The innings is a term for the collective performance of the batting side
 siddhant ke taur main, ballebaaji paksh ke sabhi gyaarah sadsy baari baari se ballebaaji karte hai, lekin kai kaarnon se "pari" isse pehle bhi khatm ho sakati he | Depending on the type of match being played, each team has one or two innings
 "pari" shabd kaa upyog kabhi kabhi ek ballebaaj ke vyaktigat yogadan ko bataane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 The main objective of the bowler is to dismiss the batsman with the help of fielders
 ek ballebaaj jab barkhaast kar diya jaataa he tab kaha jaataa he ki vah "out" ho gaya he arthath use maidan chhod kar janaa hoga or uski team kaa aglaa ballebaaj ab ballebaaji karne aayega| jab das ballebaaj barkhaast ho jate hai to puri team barkhaast ho jaati he or pari samaapt ho jaati he
 The last batsman, who has not been out, can no longer bat because always two batsmen have to be in the field together
 yah ballebaaj "note out" kehalaata he
 If an innings ends before ten batsmen are dismissed, then two batsmen are called "not out"
 ek pari teen kaarnon se jaldi khatm ho sakati he: yadi ballebaaji paksh kaa captain ghoshit kar de kii pari samaapt ho gai he, yaa ballebaaji paksh ne apana lakshya praapt kar liya ho or khel ko jeet liya ho, yaa khel karaab mausam yaa samay khatm ho jane ke kaaran samaapt kar diya jaye| simit overon ke cricket main, jab antim over kiya ja rahaa ho tab bhi do ballebaaj bache ho sakate hai
 An over or a shot is a set or group of 6 balls
 yah shabd is tarah se aayaa he kyonki ampire kahata he "over" yani puraa
 When 6 balls have been bowled, then the other bowler comes to the other end and the fielders also change their positions
 ek gendbaaj lagaataar do over nahin daal saktaa he, haalanki ek gendbaaj chor ko bina badale usee chor se kai over daal saktaa he
 The batsmen cannot change the side or the end, so the one who was a non-striker becomes a striker and the striker now becomes a non-striker
 ampire bhi apni sthiti ko badalte hai taaki jo ampire square leg kii sthiti main tha vah wicket ke peeche chalaa jaataa he or iskaa vipareet bhi hota he
 a team consists of 11 players
 praathmik kushalta ke aadhaar par ek khilaadi ko ballebaaj yaa gendbaaj ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 a well-balanced team usually consists of five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers
 team main hameshaa ek visheshgy wicket rakshak hota he kyonki yah kshetrarakshan sthiti bahut hi mahatvapurn hoti he
 Each team is headed by a captain who is responsible for making tactical decisions, such as determining the batting order, the location of fielders and the bowlers' turn
 ek khilaadi jo ballebaaji or gendbaaji donon kaa visheshgy hota he harfanmaulaa kehalaata he
 The one who acts as both batsman and wicket-keeper is called the "wicket-keeper / batsman", sometimes referred to as an all-rounder, in fact all-rounders are rarely seen as most of the players are batting or bowling
 Let's concentrate
 kshetrarakshan ke paksh ke sabhi gyaarah khilaadi maidan main ek saath rahete hai
 One of them is the wicket-keeper aka "keeper" who stands behind the wicket the striker batsman saves
 wicket keeping saamanyat: ek visheshgy hi kar saktaa he, uskaa mukhya kam un gendon ko pakadana hota he jo ballebaaj hit nahin karata he
 So that the batsman could not take Bai's runs
 vah vishesh dastaane pahentaa hai, saath hi apane nichle taangon ko cover karne ke liye pad bhi pahentaa he
 As he stands directly behind the striker, there is a lot of chance for him to catch the ball by touching the edge of the batsman's bat and dismissing the batsman
 keval vahi ek aisa khilaadi he jo ballebaaj ko stumpad out kar saktaa he
 Apart from the current bowler, the remaining 9 field guards are posted by the captain at select locations in the field
 ye sthaan tay nahin hote hai lekin ye vishesh or kabhi kabhi achche naamon se jane jate hai jaise "slip", "third main", "sili mid on" or "laang leg"| hameshaa kuch asurakshit kshetra rahete hai
 The captain is the most important member of the fielding side because he sets all the strategies, such as who should bowl; And he is also responsible for the "field setting"
 cricket ke sabhi roopon main, yadi ek match ke dauraan ek kshetrarakshak ghayal yaa biimaar ho jaataa he to uske sthaan par kisi or ko pratisthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 The substituted player cannot bowl, captain, or keep wicket
 If the injured player recovers and returns to the field, the additional player has to leave the field
 gendbaaj aksar daud kar gend daalane ke liye aate hai, haalaanki kuch gendbaaj ek yaa do kadam hi daud kar aate hai or gend daal dete hai
 a fast bowler needs momentum which causes him to run fast and from a distance
 tej gendbaaj bahut teji se gend ko daal saktaa he or kabhi kabhi vah ballebaaj ko out karne ke liye bahut hi tej gati kii gend daalata he jisase ballebaaj par tivrata se pratikriya karne kaa dabaav ban jaataa he
 Other fast bowlers rely on luck as well as speed
 kai tej gendbaaj gend ko is tarah se daalate hai ki vah hawa main "jhulati hui" yaa "gumti hui" aati he
 This type of delivery can deceive the batsman due to which his shot playing timings are inaccurate, causing the ball to touch the outer edge of the bat and can be caught by the wicket keeper or slip field protector
 gendbaajon main ek anya prakaar he "spinner" jo dhimi gati se spin karti hui gend daalata he or ballebaaj ko dhokhaa dene kii koshish karata he
 a spinner often puts the ball "over for the wicket" and provokes the batsman to play the wrong shot
 ballebaaj ko is tarah kii gendon se bahut adhik saavdhaan rahanaa hota he kyonki yah gend aksar bahut unchi or ghurnan karti hui aati he or wo us tarah se vyavahar nahin karti he jaisaa ki ballebaaj ne sochaa hota he or wo out ho saktaa he
 Between the fast bowler and the spinner are the "medium bowlers" who rely on reducing the pace of runs with their precise bowling and distract the batsmen
 sabhi gendbaajon ko unki gati or style ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 According to much cricket terminology, classification can be very confusing
 is prakaar se ek gendbaaj ko el epa main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he jiskaa arth he baayen haath kaa tej gendbaaj yaa el bi ji main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he jiskaa arth he daayen haath kaa spin gendbaaj jo "leg brake" yaa "gugli" daal saktaa he
 During bowling, the elbow can be placed or bent at any angle but it cannot be straightened during this time
 yadi kohni avaidh rup se sidhi ho jaati he to squer leg ampaire ise no ball ghoshit kar saktaa he
 According to current rules, a bowler can straighten his arm by 15 degrees or less
 kisi bhi ek samay par, maidan main do ballebaaj hote hai
 a striker protects the wicket by staying at the edge and scoring runs if possible
 uskaa saathi, jo non striker hota he wo us chor par hota he jahaan se gendbaaji kii jaati he
 The batsmen come in batting order, this order is determined by the captain, the first two batsmen are called "openers"
 unhen saamanyat: sabase khatarnaak gendbaaji kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, kyonki us samay tej gendbaaj nai gend kaa upyog karte hai
 For the top batting, usually the most capable batsman in the team is sent and the non-batsmen are sent at the end
 pehle se nirdhaarit kiya gaya ballebaaji kram anivaary nahin he or jab bhi ek wicket gir jaataa he to koi bhi khilaadi jisane ballebaaji nahin kii he use bheja ja saktaa he
 If a batsman leaves the field and is unable to return, he is actually "not out" and is not considered out, but he is dismissed as his innings is over
 pratisthapit ballebaaj ko anumati nahin hoti he
 a skilled batsman can employ a variety of "shots" or 'strokes' in both protective and aggressive forms
 mukhya kaam he gend ko balle kii samtal sataha se hit karnaa
 If the ball touches the edge of the bat, it is called the "outside edge"
 ballebaaj hameshaa hi gend ko jor se hit karne kii koshish nahin karata he, ek acha khilaadi ek halke chatur stroke se yaa keval apni kalai ko halke se ghuma kar ran bana saktaa he
 But he hits the ball away from the fielders to give him time to run
 cricket main kai prakaar ke shot khele jate hai
 The stroke applied by the batsman can be given many names such as "cut" "drive", "hook" or "pull" according to the swing or direction of the ball
 dhyaan den ki ballebaaj ko har shot ko nahin khelnaa hota he, yadi use lagata he ki gend wicket se nahin takaraayegi to vah gend ko wicket keeper tak jane ke liye "chhod" saktaa he
 In addition, when he hits the ball with his bat, he does not have to attempt a run
 vah jaanboojhkar apane pair kaa prayog karke gend ko roak saktaa he or use apni taang se dur kar saktaa he lekin yah el bi dablyu niyam ke anusaar jokhim bharaa ho saktaa he
 If an injured batsman is fit to bat but cannot run, the umpire and the captain of the fielding team may allow another member of the batting side to fight
 yadi sambhav ho to, is dhaavak ko apane saath balla rakhana hota he
 The only job of this runner is to knock in place of the injured batsman
 This runner has to wear and lift all the equipment that a batsman has worn
 donon ballebaajon ke liye dhaavak rakhana sambhav he
 The priority of the striker batsman is to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket
 And the second priority is to score runs by hitting the ball with the bat so that he and his partner have time to make runs before the fielding side returns the ball
 To register a run, both runners have to touch the ground behind the crease with their bat or any part of the body
 prayek ran score main jud jaataa he
 More than one run can be scored on a single hit, one to three runs are common in one hit, the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to score four or more runs
 isaki kshatipurti karne ke liye, yadi gend maidan kii seemaa kii bhoomi ko chooti he to ise chaar ran gina jaataa he
 And if the ball crosses the boundary into the air, it is counted as six runs
 yadi gend seemaa paar chali jaati he to ballebaaj ko bhaagane kii zarurat nahin hoti he
 Five runs is very unusual and usually depends on the ball thrown back by the field guard, "over throw"
 yadi striker visham sankhya main ran banaata he to ballebaajon kaa sthaan aapas main badal jaataa he or non striker ab striker ban jaataa he
 Only the striker gets individual runs but all runs are added to the team's total score
 ran lene kaa faisalaa ballebaaj, jisko gend kii disha or gati kaa gyaan hota he, uske dwaara kiya jaataa he or isko vah "haan", "naa" yaa "ruko" kehake bataata he
 There is a lot of risk in taking runs because if a field keeper drops the wicket, when the nearest batsman is out of his crease, the batsman is called run out
 ek team ke score ko uske dwaara banaaye gaye ranon kii sankhya or out hue ballebajo kii sankhya se pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 For example, if five batsmen have been dismissed and the team has scored 224 runs then they are said to have scored 224 runs at the loss of 5 wickets
 kshetrarakshan paksh kii or se kii gai trutiyon ke kaaran ballebaaji paksh ko jo ran praapt hote hai ve atirikt kehalaate hai
 
 yah chaar prakaar se praapt kiye ja sakate hai: Wide - An extra ball given as a penalty is given when the bowler bowls a ball that is out of the batsman's reach
 jab koi gendbaaj ek wide yaa no ball daalata he, to uski team ko dand bhugatna padataa he kyonki unhen ek atirikt gend daalani padati he jisase ballebaaji paksh ko atirikt ran banane kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 The batsman has to run and run so that he can claim the byes and leg byes
 lekin ye ran keval team ke kul score main judate hai, striker ke vyaktigat score main nahin
 a batsman can get out in ten ways and some methods are so unusual that very few examples are found in the entire history of the game
 out hone ke sabase saamaanya prakaar hai "bold", "kech", "el bi dablyu", "ran out", "stumpad" or "hit wicket"
asaamaanya tareeke hai "gend kaa do baar hit karnaa", "maidan ko baadhit karnaa", "gend ko hendal karnaa" or "samay samaapt"
 Normally a member of the fielding side "appeals" before the umpire announces the batsman's dismissal
 yah "house det?" bol kar yaa chilla kar kiya jaataa he
 It means "how is that?" If the umpire agrees with the appeal, he raises the index finger and says "out!" Otherwise he nods and says "not out"
 The appell is made in a loud voice when the circumstances of the outing are not clear
 yah el bi dablyu kii sthiti main hameshaa hota he or aksar ran out or stump kii sthiti main hota he
 In most cases the striker is out
 yadi gaiyr striker out he to vah ran out hota he, lekin vah maidan ko baadhit kar ke, ball ko pakad kar yaa samay samaapt hone par bhi out ho saktaa he
 a batsman can leave the field without being dismissed
 agar use chot lag jaae yaa vah ghayal ho jaae to vah asthaayee rup se ja saktaa he, use agle ballebaaj ke dwaara pratisthapit kar diya jaataa he
 It is recorded as retired hurt or retired sick
 ritred ballebaaj note out hota he or baad main fir se aa saktaa he
 An untouched batsman, who can retire is called retire out; The credit for which does not go to any player
 ballebaaj no ball par bold, kech, leg bifor wicket, stampya hit wicket out nahin ho saktaa he
 That wide bowler may be bowled, caught, leg before wicket, or hit the ball twice
 inamen se kuch prakaar ke out gendbaaj ke dwaara bina gend daale hi ho sakate hai
 a non-striker batsman can also be run out if he leaves the crease before the bowler is bowled and a batsman may be out at any time if he interrupts the fielding or retires
 samay samaapt, bina delivery ke hone vaali barkhaastagi he
 In all other modes of dismissal, only one batsman can be dismissed on the ball
 ek pari samaapt hoti he jab: a captain can declare his team's innings ended when at least two of his batsmen are not out, yadi baad main khilne vaali team duusare paksh se kam ran bana kar out ho jaati he to kaha jaataa he ki team n ranon se haar gai he
 If the team playing later scores enough runs to win, then it is said that it won by n wickets
 jahaan n bache hue viketon kii sankhya he
 For example, if a team crosses the score of the opposing team by losing only 6 wickets, it is said that it has "won the match by four wickets"
 do pari ke match main ek team kaa pehali or duusari pari kaa kul score dusre paksh kii pehali pari ke kul score se bhi kam ho saktaa he
 The team is then said to have won by an innings and n runs and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' total scores
 yadi ant main ballebaaji karne vaali team ol out ho jaati he or donon sidon ne samaan ran banaaye hai, to match taai ho jaataa he; yah nateeja kaaphi durlabh hota he
 In the traditional form of the game, if time runs out before either side wins, the game is declared a draw
 agar match main har paksh ke liye keval ek pari he to har pari ke liye kii adhiktam gendon kii sankhya aksar nishchit kar di jaati he
 Such matches are called "limited overs matches" or "one-day matches" and the team with the most runs wins regardless of the number of wickets
 jisase dra nahin ho saktaa he
 If this type of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula called the duckworth-louis method is re-estimated from the medium to a new target score
 ek divasiy match ko bhi "parinaam rahit " ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he yadi kisi ek team ke dwaara purv nirdhaarit over daale ja chuke hai or kisi paristhiti jaise geele mausam ke kaaran aage khel ko nahin khelaa ja saktaa he

 vishwa ke sarvocch parvaton ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye san 1808 main britishon ne bharat kaa mahaan trikoshmetiya survey ko shuru kiya
 Starting in southern India, the survey team moved north, using a large 500 kg of theodolite to make the most accurate measurements possible
 ve himalay ke najadik pahaado ke paas pahunche san 1830 main, par nepal angrejon ko desh main ghusane dene ke prati anicchhuk tha kyonki nepal ko rajnatik or sambhavit akraman kaa dar tha
 Several requests were made by the surveyor, but Nepal rejected all the requests
 britishon ko tarai se avlokan jari rakhane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, nepal ke dakshin main ek kshetra he jo himalay ke samaanaantar main he
 The situation in the Terai was very difficult due to high rainfall and malaria: three survey officers died due to malaria while two were discharged due to poor health
 phir bhi, san 1847 main, british majaboor hue or avlokan stesan se lekar 240 kilometre dur tak se himalay ki shikharon ki vistaar se avlokan karne lage
 The weather stopped work at the end of the year for three months
 san 1847 ke navambar main, bharat ke british sarweyre jeneral andrayu vaug ne savaipur stesan jo himalay ke purvi chor par sthit he se kai saare avlokan taiyaar kiye
 At that time, Kanchenjunga was considered to be the highest peak in the world and he noted that there is a peak about 230 km behind it
 jon armastrang, jo vaug ke sah adhikari thea ne bhi ek jagah se dur pashchim main is chotii ko dekha jise unhone naam diya chotii âbiâ
 Waugh later wrote that the observation indicates that the peak 'B' was higher than the Kanchenjunga, but the observation was from far away, it is necessary to observe closely for verification
 aane vaale saal main vaug ne ek survey adhikari ko tarai main chotii âbiâ ko nazdik se avlokan karne ke liye bheja par badalon ne saare prayaas ko roak diya
 In 1849, Waugh ceded the area to James Nicholson
 nicholson ne 190 kimi dur jirol se do avlokan taiyaar kiye
 Nicholson then brought a large conglomerate with him and headed east, with Nicholson from five different locations receiving more than 30 observations from 174 km to the nearest peak
 apane avlokanon par aadhaarit kuch hisaab-kitaab karne ke liye nicholson waapas patna, ganga nadi ke paas gaya
 Its rough calculation in Patna gave the average height of peak 'B' at 9,200 m à¤®à¥, but it is not considered light refraction, which makes the elevation false
 sankhya saaf darshaya gaya, yadhyapi vah chotii âbiâ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha
 Although Nicholson suffered from malaria and was forced to return home, the accounts could not be finished
 maikel henacy, vaug kaa ek sahaayak roman sankhya ke aadhaar par chotiyon ko nirdisht karnaa shuru kar diya, usne kanchanajangha ko IX naam diya or choti âbiâ ko XV naam diya
 In May 1852, the center of the survey was brought to Dehradun, an Indian mathematician Radhanath Sikdar and a surveyor from Bengal named the world's highest peak for the first time using a trigonometric calculation based on Nicholson's Everest after a former chief
 , Repeated accounts were done to verify and its official statement, that XV is the tallest, was delayed for many years
 vaug ne nicholas ke data par san 1854 main kaam shuru kar diya or hisaab-kitaab, prakaash apvartan ke len-dein, vaayu-daab, avlokan ke vishaal duuri ke taapmaana par apane karmchaariyon ke saath lagbhag do saal kaam kiya
 In March 1856, through a letter, he completely announced his discovery to his representative in Calcutta
 kanchanajangha kii oonchaai saaf taur par 28,156 feet bataaya gaya, jabaki XV ki oonchaai bataai gai
 Vogue concluded about XV that "it is more probable that it is the tallest in the world"
