unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society
 france kii aarthik avasthaa sankatagrast thi
 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy

 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income
 rajya rin ke boj tale dabta gaya
 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy
 desh kii aarthik durvyavastha ko vyapaar vaanijya ko protsaahan dekar sudhara ja saktaa tha parantu sarkaar kii vaanijya niti itani aniyantrit evam doshapurn thi ki usase rajya main utpaadan evam vyapaar kaa vikaas sambhav nahin tha
 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He said that i prefer the rule of one lion in place of hundred mice

 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"

 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year

 In this, evils of governance, corruption of the church and inequality prevailing in every field were highlighted
 france kii sarkaar ne didaron ko apana ghor shatru mana or uski pustak par anek pratibandh lagaae
 a section of thinkers was focused on the economic disorder and analysis prevailing in France at this time

 The farmers hoped that by raising their voice against feudal privileges, they would be able to secure their rights and be free from their exploitation cycle
 is tarah francisi rajtantr kaa samarthan karne ke liye francisi jansankhya kaa koi mahatvapurn bhaag taiyaar nahin tha
 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages

 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker
 raja ko kisi desh se yuddh yaa sandhi karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor
 rashtriya sabha ne france kii prashasnic sanrachana main parivartan kiya
 The entire country was divided into 83 departments by abolishing the ancient provinces

 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians
 jiske anusaar “saamaanya ichha” hi saarvbhaumik ichha he
 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed
 tritiy charan-1794-99 -“diarectory” kaa shashan vastutah neshnal kanvension ne ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan kar karypalika kaa uttardaayitv 5 sadasyeey “nideshak mandal” ko saunpa
 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
 France was the only country in entire Europe where there was a complete lack of a national spirit
 iske chalate bhi sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Effect of American freedom struggle- 1766 i
 main american swatantraaa sangram prarambh hua
 The American people revolted against England
 france ke sainikon ko bhi is swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila at: unhone yah mahasus kiya ki yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa prapti kii ja sakati he
 He also realized that freedom is possible only through freedom
 france lautne par unhone dekha kii jis swatantraaa ko liye unhonen america main yuddh kiya usee swatantraaa kaa france main purnat: abhaav he
 Hence, he became restless for the revolution here and tried to get freedom through war
 europe ke anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 Superiority of French Civilization france main hi kranti hone kaa ek vishisht kaaran yah tha ki yahan kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe rashtron kii apeksha adhik samrudh or vaibhav purna thi
 Even in terms of governance, the rule of France was highly organized
 france sampoorn europe sabhyataa or saanskriti kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states

 The science of marking the sequence of development of instruments is dependent on archaeological crafts, artistic notation and literary references
 chunki kisi ek anusandhan maarg main aankade adhure ho sakate hai, sabhi teen maarg ek behatar aitihaasik tasviir uplabdh karaate hai
 European music history, written until the 19th century, begins with these mythological descriptions of how instruments were invented
 aise vivaranon main shaamil he jubaal, can ke vanshaj or "un sabhi kaa pita jo harp or organ sambhalate hai", paan, panpipe ke avishkaarak or marakari, kaha jaataa he jisane kachhue ke sookhe khol se pehla lahore banaaya tha
 Modern history has replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation and is sometimes corroborated by archaeological evidence
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki vaadyayantra kaa koi nishchit "avishkaar" nahin kiya gaya, chunki "vaadya yantra" shabd kii paribhaasha vidwaan or bhavi-avishkaarak, donon ke liye puri tarah se vyaktiparak he
 For example, a Homo Habilis slapping his body could be an under-construction instrument regardless of its intent
 maanav sharir se pare jin upkarnon ko pratham vaadyayantra mana jaataa he, ve hai jhunjhune, stamper or vibhinn prakaar ke drum
 ye aarambhik yantra, bhaavnaatmak harkaton, jaise nrity main dhwani jodne ke maanav ke sanchaalan aaveg ke kaaran viksit hue
 aakhirkaar, kuch samskritiyon ne apane vaadyayantron ke liye anushthan kaaryakramon ko joda
 un samskritiyon ne adhik jatil parakashan upkarnon or anya upkarnon kaa vikaas kiya, jaise riban read, bansuri or turahiyaan
 inamen se kuch label main, aadhunik samay main prayog kiye jane vaale sanketarthon se kaaphi bhinn sanketarth hai; aarambhik bansuriyon or turahiyon ko aisa label unki mul karypranali or upyog ke liye lagaaya jaataa tha na ki aadhunik yantron se kisi samanta ke liye
 The early cultures for which drums developed ritualistic and even sacred significance are the Chukchi people of Far Eastern Russia, the native people of Melanisia, and many cultures in Africa
 In fact, in every African culture, drums were widely present
 ek purvi africa janajati, vahinda ise itnaa pavitra maanati thi ki sultan ke alaava ise dekhne vaale kisi anya vyakti ke liye yah ghaatak hota tha
 Eventually humans developed the concept of using instruments to produce melodies
 vaadyayantra ke vikaas main is samay tak, raag, sirf gayan main hi aam tha
 Similar to the process of repetition in language, instrumentalists first developed repetition and then instrumentalization
 An early form of melody was produced by banging a tube of two different sizes - one tube produced a "clear" sound and the other produced a "deep" sound
 aise yantron ke jode main bullrorer, slit drum, sip turahiyaan or khaal drum bhi shaamil he
 Cultures that used pairs of these instruments linked gender with them; The "father" was a larger or more energetic device, while the "mother" was a smaller or slower device
 sangeet ke vaadyayantra hazaron varshon tak is rup main bane rahe, jab tak ki praarambhik zylophone ke rup main, sur ke teen yaa usase adhik pattern kaa vikaas nahin hua
 Xylophone originated in the mainland and archipelago of Southeast Asia and from there it spread to Africa, America and Europe
 Along with the xylophone, which ranged from a simple three "leg bar" set to a carefully tuned set of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the Bhumi Veena, Bhumi Jithar, musical Dhanush and Jau Harp

 Despite this development, very few instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia main vaadyayantron ke praarambhik itihaas ko phir se sangathit karne ke liye vidwaanon ko sumerion yaa acadian main likhi kalakritiyon or keelakaar lekh par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Even the process of naming these devices is challenging since there is no clear distinction between the various tools and the words used to define them
 haalanki, sumerian or babylon ke kalakaaron ne mukhya rup se samarohik vaadyayantron kaa ankan kiya he, itihaaskaar, chah ideophone ke bich bhed karne main sakasham hue hai jo aarambhik mesopotamia main istemaal kiye jate the: kanakashan club, claper, sistra, ghantiyaan, simbal or jhunjhuna

 Rather, the history of musical instruments in the region begins with the Indus Valley Civilization which dates back to around 3000 BC
 Emerged around
 The various rattles and whistles found with the artifacts found in the excavations are the only physical evidence of the instrument

 Other major instruments used during the early centuries of AD included the double clarinet of snake charmers, bagpipes, barrel drums, cross flutes and miniature tentacles
 Overall, there was no unique instrument in India until the Middle Ages

 Early Chinese philosophers such as Confucius and Mencius and Laoji shaped the development of instruments in China and adopted a similar approach to music as the Greeks did
 The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying their instruments according to their material makeup

 For example, he had no stringed instruments; All his instruments were idiophones, drums and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets
 Of these, only the flute was capable of producing melodies

 The first mention of this type of influence dates back to 384 AD, when China established the East Turkistan Orchestra in its Royal Assembly after its conquest in Turkistan
 bharat, mongolia or anya deshon ke prabhaav bhi padate rahe
 In fact, the Chinese tradition attributes most of the instruments of the time to these countries

 Some of the first bent zithers appeared in China in the 9th or 10th century, influenced by Mongolian culture

 gong-sadrush yah upkaran ek kaansya chakri tha jise ek mungari ke bajaay ek lakdi ke hathode se thoka jaataa tha
 Tubular drums, stick zithers named Veena, miniature fiddle, double and triple flutes, circular trumpets and curved Indian horns emerged in this period
 Islamic influences gave rise to new types of drums, which, unlike the irregular drums of the pre-islamic period, were perfectly round or octagonal

 People began writing books about the making, playing and cataloging of instruments; The first such book was Sebastian Firdung's 1511 treatise Musica getuscht und angezogen
 Firdung's work is considered particularly complete because it also included descriptions of "irregular" instruments such as hunter's horns and cow bells, although Firdung has also criticized them

 In the sixteenth century, the "classical motifs" that instrument makers gave to most instruments continue to this day, such as the violin
 Format beauty was also noticed - listeners were just as fascinated by beauty as an instrument
 Therefore, manufacturers paid special attention to materials and workmanship and instruments became collectibles in museums and homes

 Sachs saw this trend as a "collapse" of the organ's normal sound
 vaadyayantron ko vargeekrut karne ke kai alag-alag tareeke hai
 All methods examine some combination of the physical properties of the instrument, how the music is performed on the instrument, and the position of the instrument in the orchestra or other musical groups

 Erik von Hornbostel and Kurt Sax later took the ancient method and in 1914 published a comprehensive new scheme for classification in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie
 unki paddati ko aaj vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he or ise aksar hornbostel-sacks paddati ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The original sax-hornbostel method classified instruments into four main groups: sacks ne baad main ek paanchvaan varg joda, electrophone, jaise thermin, jo electronic tareeke se dhwani utpann karte hai
 There are several sub-groups within each class
 is pranali kii aalochana kii gai or ise pichley varshon main sanshodhit kiya gaya, lekin iskaa vyapak rup se prayog organologist or ethnomyuicologist dwaara hi kiya jaataa he
 Andre Schaffner, patron of the Musée de l'homme, disagreed with the saxe-hornbostel system and in 1932 developed his own system
 shafnar kaa maananaa tha ki ek vaadyayantra ke vargeekaran kaa nirdhaaran, uske vaadan kii vidhi ke bajaay uski shaareerik sanrachana ko karnaa chahie
 His method divided the instruments into two classes: instruments whose body is solid and vibratory, and instruments that have staggered air
 pashchimi vaadyayantron ko bhi, usee parivaar ke anya upkarnon ke saath tulana main aksar unki sangeet seemaa dwaara vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 These terminologies are based on the classification of singing sounds: kuch upkaran ek se adhik shrenee main aate hai: udhaaharan ke liye, celo ko yaa to tener yaa baas mana ja saktaa he, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki iskaa sangeet samooh main kaise feet baithta he or trombone ho saktaa he olto, tener, yaa baas or french horn, baas, baritone, tener, yaa olto, is baat par nirbhar karte hue kii kis sa par range yah khelaa jaataa he
 Template: Vocal and instrumental pitch ranges kai vaadyayantron main range, unke naam ke hisse ke rup main hota he: sopraano sexophone, tener sexophone, baritone sexophone, olto bansuri, baas bansuri, olto recorder, baas guitar, aadi
 Additional adjectives describe an instrument above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabas clarinet
 jab kisi vaadya ke naam main istemaal kiye jate hai to ye shabd saapeksh hote hai, jo vaadyayantra ke range ko uske parivaar ke anya upkarnon kii tulana main varnit karte hai or na kii maanav awaz ke range main yaa anya pariwaron ke upkarnon kii tulana main
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek baas bansuri kaa range C3 se F♯6 tak he, jabaki ek baas clerinet ek saptak neeche bajataa he
 Instrumental production is a specialized occupation that requires years of training, practice and sometimes becoming an apprentice

 It is exactly like a perfect black body in thermodynamics
 kalenidr kaa kwantum vishleshan yah darshata he ki unamem taapmaana or hawking vikiran hota he
 Despite its invisible interior, a black hole can make its presence visible through interactions with other substances
 masalan kalenidr kaa pataa taron ke kisi samooh kii gati se lagaaya ja saktaa he jo antariksh ke khaali dikhaai dene vaale ek hisse kii parikrama kar rahe hon
 Alternatively, with a companion star, you can see the gas dropping into a relatively small black hole
 yah gas sarpil aakaar main andar kii taraf aati he, bahut ucch taapmaana tak garm ho kar badi maatra main vikiran chhodti he jiskaa pataa prithvi par sthit yaa prithvi kii kaksha main gumti doorabeenon se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 As a result of such observations, a scientific consensus has emerged that, despite their non-appearance, black holes exist in our universe
 inhen vidhiyon se vaigyanikon ne pataa lagaaya he ki hamaari gallexi, kshirmarg, ke kendra main sthit dhanu e* naamak radio strot main ek vishalkay kalachhidr sthit he jiskaa dravyaman hamaare suraj ke dravyaman se 43 lakh guna he
 Theoretically, a substance of any quantity can become a black hole if it is compressed within a space whose radius is equal to its equivalent Schwarzschild radius

 In contrast to electron and neutron contingency pressure, neither the Earth nor the Sun have the required mass and therefore neither the required gravitational force
 in dabaavon se ubarkar or adhik sankuchit hone main sakasham hone ke liye ek taare ke liye aavashyak nunatam dravyaman tolman - oppenheimer - volcophf dwaara prastaavit had he, jo lagbhag teen saura dravyaman he
 a black hole is often defined as an object whose migration velocity is greater than the speed of light
 yah tasvirgunatmak rup se galat he lekin kalenidr kii trigya ke pariman ke kram ko samajhane kaa ek tarika pradaan karti he
 The escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must have so that the object escapes the orbit of a gravitational source before stopping
 prithvi par palaayan veg 11
2 kimi / second ke baraabar he, atah vastu chaahe koi bhi ho, ek goli yaa ek ball, ise prithvi kii sataha par waapas girane se bachane ke liye kam se kam 11
2 kimi / second kii gati se chalanaa hoga
 To calculate the migration velocity in Newtonian mechanics, suppose there is a heavy object whose mass m is centered at the origin
 ek m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman vaali duusari vastu mul se r { \ displaystyle r} kii duuri par v { \ displaystyle v} gati se shuru hoti he, infinity kii taraf bachakar nikalne kii koshish karti he, iske paas thik utani gatij urja honi chahie taaki vah nakaaratmak gurutvkarshan kii sambhavit urja se paar paa sake, baad main kuch bhi shesh na rahe: Thus, as it gets closer to r = ∞ { \ displaystyle r = \ infty}, its kinetic energy decreases, eventually reaching infinity without any motion
 yah formula critical palaayan veg v { \ displaystyle v} ko m { \ displaystyle M} or r { \ displaystyle r} ke sandarbh main darshata he
 But this formula also says that for each value of v { \ displaystyle v} and m { \ displaystyle M}, r { \ displaystyle r} has a critical value so that v { \ displaystyle v} is a particle of motion
 Only managed to escape: jab veg prakaash kii gati ke baraabar ho, yah ek kaalpanik neutonian dark star kii trigya pradaan karata he, ek neutonian sharir jahaan se prakaash kii gati se chalane vaala koi kan batch nahin saktaa he
 In the trend most commonly used for the value of the radius of a black hole, the radius of the event horizon is equal to this Newtonian value
 saamaanya saapekshata main, antariksh-samay kii vakrit prakruti or vibhinn nirdeshaankon ke chayan kii vajah se r nirdeshaank ko paribhaashit karnaa saral nahin he
 For this result to be true, the value of r must be defined so that r radius in curved space times a surface area of A sphere can still be revealed by this formula a = 4 π r 2 { \ displaystyle a This definition of = 4 \ pi r ^ {2}} r makes sense only if the gravitational field is spherically symmetric, so that there are many jackals on top of one that have a uniform gravitational field
 kisi vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra se batch nikalne ke liye palaayan veg uske ghanatv par nirbhar karti he; yah he, uske dravyaman or maatra kaa anupaat
 a black hole is formed when an object becomes so dense that even light cannot escape from it for a particular distance, because the speed of light will be less than the escape velocity of the black hole
 neutonian gurutvkarshan ke vipareet, saamaanya saapekshata main, kalenidr se dur jaataa hua prakaash dhimaa nahin padataa he or vaapis nahin mudata he
 The Schwarzschild radius is still the last distance from which the light can escape to infinity, but the exit light, starting at the Schwarzschild radius, does not return, it remains outside
 schvarjaschild trigya andar, prayek vastu andar kii taraf gati karti he, kisi prakaar centre main kuchle jane hetu
 In general relativity, the mass of the black hole may remain centered on a gravitational singularity), it may be a point, a ring, a light beam, or a sphere; At present, exact information about it is not available
 is singhulerity ke aasapaas ek golakaar seemaa hoti he jise ghatana kshitij kaha jaataa he
 It is the 'returning place' to the event horizon, a boundary beyond which all matter and radiation are drawn towards the singularity within
 kendrastha is singhulerity or ghatana kshitij ke bich kii duuri kalenidr kaa aakaar hoti he or yah ikai main dravyaman ke dugane ke baraabar hoti he jahaan g or c baraabar 1 hai
 The radius of a black hole with a mass equal to the Sun is about 3 km
 isse kai guni adhik duriyon ke liye, kalenidr kii guruttvakarshan shakti samaan dravyaman vaale kisi bhi anya sharir kii guruttvakarshan shakti ke thik baraabar hoti he, bilkul surya ke samaan
 Therefore, if the Sun is converted into a black hole of equal mass, the orbits of the planets will remain unchanged
 kai prakaar ke kalenidr hai, jo unke vishisht aakaar dwaara pahachaane jate hai
 When they form due to the gravitational collapse of a star, they are called stellar black holes
 gallexiyon ke centre main banane vaale kalahidron ke dravyaman saura dravyaman ke kai arab guna ho sakate hai, unhen vishalkay kaala chhidr kaha jaataa he kyonki ve ati vishaal hote hai
 There are also some intermediate black holes between these two scales, whose mass is up to several thousand times the solar mass
 bahut kam dravyaman vaale kalenidr kaa, jinke bare main aisa mana jaataa he ki unka nirmaan brahmand ke shuruaati itihaas main big baing ke dauraan hua hoga, ab bhi astitv bhi ho sakate hai or unhen primoradial kalachhidr kaha jaataa he
 Presently, their existence is not yet certain
 pratyaksh taur par ek kalenidr ko dekh paanaa sambhav nahin he
 However, its presence can be gauged by its gravitational effect on the surrounding environment, particularly by microvasives and active galactic nuclei, where substances falling into nearby black holes overheat and emit large amounts of X-ray radiation Huh
 yah prekshan vidhi khagolavidon ko unke astitv kaa pataa lagane main sakasham banaati he
 Black holes are the only substances that meet these scales and conform to the framework of general relativity
 ek aise baari sharir kii avadharana jisase ki prakaash bhi bachane se asamarth ho ko, bhuvigyaani jon michel dwaara 1783 main henry kavendish ko likhe gayi ek patr main prakat kiya gaya tha or royal socity dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha: In 1796, mathematician pierre-simon Laplace promoted the idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du sistem du Monde
 unnisvin sadi main in "dark stars" par dhyaan nahin diya gaya tha, kyonki tab aisa mana jaataa tha ki prakaash drabyaman rahit tarang he atah gurutv ke prabhaav se mukt he
 Contrary to the modern black hole concept, it was believed that the object behind the horizon could not collapse
 1915 main, albert oinstin ne apane saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko viksit kiya, ve pehle hi yah siddh kar chuke the ki gurutvkarshan prakaash kii gati par vastav main prabhaav daalata he
 a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild gave the solution of the gravitational field of a point mass and a spherical mass, showing that the existence of a black hole is theoretically possible
 schvarjaschild trigya ko ab gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke ghatana kshitij kii trigya ke rup main janaa jaataa he, lekin is tathy ko us samay nahin samajha ja sakaa tha, udhaaharan ke liye schvarjaschild khud ise bhautik nahin maanate the
 Johannes Droste, a student of Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave a similar solution a few months after Schwarzschild on point mass and wrote extensively more about its properties
 1930 main, khagolvid subramanyan chandrashekhar nen saamaanya saapekshata kaa upyog karte hue yah gananaa kii ki electron-dijanret padaarth vaale ek gaiyr-chakrit sharir kaa saura dravyaman yadi 1
44 se adhik hua to uskaa patan ho jaayegaa
 His argument was opposed by Arthur Eddington, who believed that something would surely prevent this collapse
 edington aanshik rup se sahi the: chandrashekhar seemaa se thoda adhik drabyaman vaala safed bouna sitara patan ke baad neutron taare main parivartit ho jaayegaa
 lekin 1939 main, robert oppenheimer or unke sahyogiyon ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki chandrasekhar dwaara die gaye kaarnon kii vajah se, lagbhag teen se adhik saura drabyaman vaale sitara kaa patan ek blike hole ke rup main ho jaayegaa
 Oppenheimer and his co-authors used the Schwarzschild coordinate system, which produced mathematical specificity at the Schwarzschild radius, in other words, some of the components used in this equation became infinite at the Schwarzschild radius
 iskaa arth yah niklaa gaya ki schvarjaschild trigya ek "bulbule" kii seemaa thi jisamen samay "ruk" jaataa tha
 This is a valid point of view from outside, but not for those who fall inside
 is visheshta ke kaaran, patan ho chuke taron ko kuch samay ke liye "frozen stars " ke naam se janaa gaya, kyonki ek bahari paryvekshak ko taare kii sataha us samay main jami hui dikhaai degaa jis pal main taare kaa patan use schvarjaschild trigya ke andar le ja rahaa hoga
 This is a known feature of modern black holes, but it must be emphasized that the surface light of the frozen star redshifts very quickly and turns the black hole to black very quickly
 kai bhautikavid is vichaar ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahe the ki schvarjaschild trigya ke bheetar samay ruk jaataa he or 20 varshon tak is bishay par logon ki ruchi nahin rahi thi
 In 1958, David Finkisten introduced the concept of the event horizon by presenting Eddington – Finkelstein coordinates, which enabled him to prove that the Schwarzschild surface r = 2 m is not a specificity but rather serves as an ideal monolithic membrane
 Is: The causal effects can cross it in one direction
 isamen or openhimer ke parinaamon ko koi khaas virodhabhas nahin tha, balki isane ek andar girte hue paryvekshak ke drushtikon ko shaamil karke iskaa vistaar hi kiya
 All theories up to now, including Finkelstein, covered only non-rotating black holes
 1963 main, roy ker ne aavarti blike hole ke liye ekadam sateek samaadhaan khoj liya
 Its rotated singularity was not a dot but a ring
 kuch samay baad, roger penros yah sabit karne main sakasham ho gayi ki singhulerity sabhi blike holon ke andar pai jaati hai
 In 1967, astronomers discovered Pulsar and within a few years were able to prove that the known Pulsars are fast-rotating neutron stars
 us samay tak, neutron taare bhi sirf saidhantik utsukata tak hi simit the
 Hence the discovery of pulsars aroused interest in all those high-density objects whose structure would have been possible by gravitational collapse
 bhautikavid jon whealer ko vyapak rup se 1967 main die gaye apane saarvajanik bhaashan hamaara brahmad: gyaat or agyaat main blike hole shabd ko gadhane kaa shrey diya jaataa he, adhik dushkar "gurutveey rup se purnatah patan ko praapt kar chukaa tara" ke ek vikalp ke rup main
 However, Wheeler insisted that the term was coined by someone else at the conference and he only adopted it as a useful short-word
 yah shabd 1964 main eni aving dwaara AAAS ko likhe ek patr main bhi uddhrut kiya gaya tha: When the entire fuel of a big star is burnt, a huge explosion occurs in it, which is called a supernova
 visphot ke baad jo padaarth bachataa he vah dhire dhire simatana shuru hota he or bahut hi ghaney pind kaa rup le letaa he jise neutron star kehete hai
 If the neutron star is too large, the pressure of gravity will be so low that it will shrink with its own weight and become so dense that a black hole will form and appear as a black hole, a black hole or a black hole
 no hair prameya main kaha gaya he ki, ek baar sthapit ho jane ke baad blike hole ke keval teen swatantra bhautik lakshan hote hai: dravyaman, charge or koniya gati
 If the values of these two black holes have the same values or parameters, then it becomes quite difficult to distinguish between them
 ye lakshan khaas hote hai kyonki ye blike hole ke baahar se dikhaai dete hai
 For example, a charged black hole, like any other charged object, pushes the same charge away, despite the fact that photons, which are responsible for the electrical and magnetic forces, do not escape the internal field
 iskaa kaaran he gous niyam, ek bade sphier se baahar nikalne vaala kul vidyut pravaah hameshaa samaan rahata he or sphier ke bheetar ke kul charge ko maapta he
 When the charge falls into the black hole, electric field lines persist and peek beyond the horizon, and these field lines conserve the total charge of all falling materials
 bijli kshetra line antat blike hole kii sataha par samaan rup se fail jaati hai, sataha par samaan kshetra line ghanatv sthapit karti hai
 In this context, the black hole acts like a common conducting sphere that has a certain resistivity
 isi tarah, blike hole ko samahit kiye hue ek sphere ke kul dravyaman ko gaus niyam ke gurutveey anuroop kaa upyog karke paaya ja saktaa he, blike hole se bahut dur baithe baithe
 Similarly, angular momentum can be measured from far away, by gravitational-magnetic field using frame dragging
 jab blike hole kisi padaarth ko nigalata he, uskaa kshitij gharshan yukt vistrut jhilli kii tarah dolan karata he, ek kshanik pranali, jab tak yah antim avasthaa main sthapit nahin ho jaataa
 This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism or gauge theory, which never have any friction or resistivity because they are time reversible
 kyonki blike hole antat ek antim avasthaa main keval teen maapdandon ke saath sthapit hota he, praarambhik sthitiyon ke bare main jaankaree ko khone se bachaane kaa koi tarika nahin he: blike hole ke gurutvkarshan or vidyut kshetra uske andar jane vaali chizon ke bare main bahut kam jaankaree pradaan kar pate hai
 Missing information includes everything that cannot be measured at great distances from the black hole horizon, such as the total baryon number, the lepton number, and almost all other preserved pseudo-charges in particle physics
 yahan se karnaa he yah vyavhaar itnaa ajeeb he ki ise 'blike hole jaankaree nuksaan virodhabhas' kaha gaya he
 Traditionally, the disappearance of information in black holes is quite strange, because general relativity is a Lagrangian theory that appears to be time reversible and Hamiltonian from above
 lekin kshitij ke kaaran blike hole samay palatwaan nahin hota he: padaarth isamen ghus sakate hai par nikal nahin sakate
 The reversal of time in a common black hole is called a white hole, although entropy and quantum mechanics show that white holes are similar to black holes
 no-hair prameya hamaare brahmad or usamen shaamil padaarthon kii prakruti ke bare main kuch manyataon banaata he, jabaki anya manyatayen alag nishkarsh pradaan karti hai
 For example, if magnetic single-poles exist, as stated by some theories, magnetic charge would be the fourth parameter of a conventional black hole
 nimnlikhit maamalon ke liye no-hair prameya ke prati-udahaaran gyaat hai: These exceptions are sometimes unstable and sometimes do not lead away from black holes to newly preserved quantum numbers
 hamaare chaar-aiami or lagbhag sapaat brahmand main is prameya ko lagu hona chahie
 The simplest black hole is one that has a mass but has neither charge nor angular momentum
 in blike hole ko schvarjaschild blike hole ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, bhautikavid karl schvarjaschild ke naam par jinhone 1915 main is samaadhaan kii khoj kii thi
 This was the first reliable and accurate solution to be discovered for the Einstein field equation and according to the Birkhoff theorem it is the only vacuum solution that is spherically symmetric
 iskaa matlab yah he ki is tarah ke ek blike hole ke gurutvkarshan kshetra or samaan dravyaman kii kisi bhi anya golakaar vastu ke gurutvkarshan kshetra bich koi drishy antar nahin he
 For the black hole, the popular belief that it "pulls every object in" around itself is true only near its horizon; At a distance, its external gravitational field is essentially the same as that of ordinary heavy bodies
 blike hole ke adhik saamaanya samaadhaan 20 veen sadi ke uttarardh main khoje gayi the
 The Reisner – Nordström metric describes a black hole with electric charge, while the Kerr metric provides a rotating black hole
 kerr -newman metric saamanyatya adhik prachlit sthir blike hole samaadhaan he, jo charge or koniya gati donon kaa varnan karata he
 Although the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, charge and angular momentum are constrained by mass
 prakritik ikaayiyon main, kul charge q { \ displaystyle q \ ,} or kul koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se ummid kii jaati he ki ve nimnlikhit ko santusht karenge For a black hole with mass M
 is asamanta ko bharne vaale blike hole ko extrimal kaha jaataa he
 Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate inequality exist, but do not have horizons
 in samaadhaanon main nagn vishistataa he or inhen abhautik mana jaataa he, kyonki cosmik sensorship pariklpana vaastavik padaarthon ke samgr gurutvkarshan patan kii vajah se is vishistataa ko nakaar detii he
 This is supported by numerical representations
 vidyut chumbakeey bal kii apekshaakrit badi takat ke kaaran, taron ke patan se banane vaale blike hole se apeksha kii jaati he ki ve taron ke neutral charge ko banaaye rakhenge
 Rotation has been considered a common feature of compact objects and it appears that the angular momentum of the binary hole X-ray source GRS 1915 + 105, a candidate for a black hole, is close to its maximum possible value
 blike hole ko saamanytah unke dravyaman ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, koniya gati j { \ displaystyle j \ ,} se swatantra
 ghatana kshitij trigya, yaa shwarzschild trigya, dwaara nirdhaarit blike hole kaa aakaar dravyaman m { \ displaystyle m \ ,} ke anupaat main hota he, Where rsh { \ displaystyle r_ {sh} \ ,} is the Schwarzschild radius and m ⨀ { \ displaystyle m _ { \ bigodot}} is the mass of the Sun
 is prakaar ek blike hole kaa aakaar or dravyaman saadhaaran rup se sambandhit hote hai, roteshan se swatantra
 According to this criterion, black holes are classified as follows: blike hole kii vishistataa he ghatana kshitij kaa prakat hona; antariksh-samay kii ek seemaa jiske pare ghatnaayen ek bahari paryvekshak ko prabhavit nahin kar sakati hai
 As predicted by general relativity, the presence of mass distorts the space-time in such a way that the paths of the particles lead them to that mass
 blike hole ke ghatana kshitij par yah vikruti itani shaktishaalee ho jaati he ki baahar jane kaa koi maarg bachataa hi nahin he
 Once a particle enters the event horizon, it becomes inevitable to go inside the black hole
 dur khadey ek darshak ke liye, blike hole ke nikat kii ghadiyaan zyada dhire chalati prathit hongi
 Because of this effect, the spectator standing far away will notice that an object falling into a black hole slows down as it approaches its event horizon, seemingly taking infinite time to reach it
 usee samay is vastu kii sabhi kriyaayein dhimi ho jaati hai jiske parinaam swaroop nikalne vaala prakaash adhik laal or maddham prathit hota he, is prabhaav ko gravitational red shift kaha jaataa he
 Finally, the falling object becomes so dim that it stops appearing, at one point just before it reaches the event horizon
 gaiyr-chakrit blike hole ke liye schvarjaschild trigya spherical ghatana kshitij ko seemaa-mukt karti he
 The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to the mass
 chakrit blike hole main vikrut, nonspherical ghatana kshitij hota he
 Since the event horizon is not a physical surface but only a mathematically defined boundary, there is nothing preventing matter or radiation from entering the black hole, only they are prevented from exiting
 blike hole ke liye saamaanya saapekshata dwaara diya gaya varnan ek sanniktan he or aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum gurutv prabhaav ghatana kshitij ke nikat se mahatvapurn ho jate hai
 This makes the observation of matter near the event horizon of a black hole, the study of general relativity and its proposed extents
 haalaanki blike hole swayan urja vikirit nahin karte hai, ghatana kshitij ke thik baahar se, hawking vikiran ke madhyam se, vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran or padaarth kan vikeern ho sakate hai
 Singularity occurs at the center of the black hole, where there is an infinite density due to the suppression of matter, the gravitational pull is infinitely powerful and there is infinite distortion in space-time
 iskaa matlab ek blike hole kaa dravyaman shunya volum vaale ek kshetra main purnatah sankuchit ho jaataa he
 This zero-volume, infinitely dense region at the center of a black hole is called gravitational singularity
 ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity kii lambaai, chaudai or oonchaai shunya hoti he; ek chakrit blike hole kii singhulerity challe ke aakaar kii hoti he or roteshan ke plane main sthit hoti he
 The rings have no thickness so there is no volume
 saamaanya saapekshata main singhulerity kii upasthiti ko saamanytah siddhant ke lagu na hone kaa sanket mana jaataa he
 Although this is expected; This occurs in situations where quantum mechanical effects should have been described, due to extremely high densities and particle interactions
 ab tak kwantum or gurutv ke prabhaav kaa ek hi siddhant main sangyojan karnaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa he
 It is generally expected that the theory of quantum gravity will contain black holes without singularity
 photone sphere shunya motaai vaali ek spherical seemaa he jahaan sphere kii sparsharekha main chalate hue photone ek gol kaksha main funs jaayenge
 For non-recurring black holes, the radius of the photon sphere is 1
5 times the Schwarzschild radius
 ye kakshaen gatisheel rup se asthir hai, isliye koi bhi choti si gadbady bhi samay ke saath badi hoti jaayegi or yaa to use blike hole ke pare phenk degi yaa ghatana kshitij ke bheetar dhakel degi
 Although light can still escape from inside the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon region from the inside and outward trajectory will be occupied by a black hole
 isliye koi bhi prakaash jo photone sphere ke andar se baahar khadey ek darshak tak pahunchataa he, nishchit rup se photone sphere ke adanr parantu ghatana kshitij ke baahar kii kisi vastu dwaara utsarjit hua hoga
 Other compact objects such as neutron stars may also have photon spheres
 yah tathy is baat par aadhaarit he ki ek vastu kaa gurutv kshetra uske vaastavik aakaar par nirbhar nahin karata, isliye koi vastu jo schvarjaschild trigya ke 1
5 guna se adhik choti ho us, vastu ke drabyaman se sambandhit ek photone sphere vastav main hoga
 The rotating black hole surrounds the ergosphere salt in an inter-time zone in which it is impossible to stand still
 yah frem-dreging naamak ek prakriya kaa parinaam he; saamaanya saapekshata kii bhavishyavaanee he ki koi bhi chakrit drabyaman, swanyam ko ghere hue antariksh samay ko thodaa khinchne kii cheshtaa karegaa
 Any object near the rotating mass will start moving in the direction of the wheel
 ek chakrit blike hole ke liye ghatana kshitij ke paas iskaa prabhaav itnaa majboot ho jaataa he ki kisi vastu ko sthir khadey rahane maatr ke liye iske vipareet disha main prakaash ki gati se bhi tej chalanaa hoga
 The ergosphere of a black hole is surrounded by the following: argosphior ke bheetar, antariksh-samay prakaash se adhik gati se khinchaa jaataa he-- saamaanya saapekshata main bhautik vastuon kaa prakaash se tej gati se chalanaa varjit he, lekin antariksh-samay kshetron ko anumati detaa he ki ve anya antariksh-samay kshetron kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal saken
 Objects and radiation can remain in orbit within the ergosphere without falling into the center
 lekin ve mandara nahin sakate, kyonki iske liye unhen swayan ke antariksh-samay kshetra kii tulana main peeche kii ore prakaash se bhi tej chalane kii aavashyaktaa hogi, jo ek bahari darshak kii tulana main prakaash se tej chal rahe hai
 Objects and radiation can also escape from the ergosphere
 asal main penros prakriya bhavishyavaanee karti he ki vasteen kabhi kabhi agosphior ud kar baahar chali jaayengi, iske liye urja ve blike hole kii kuch urja ko "chura" kar praapt karengi
 If a large part of the total mass of objects escapes in this way, the speed of the black hole will slow down and eventually stop moving
 blike hole kii aakarshak chhavi ke kaaran yah sawaal uthanaa lajimi he ki kya vastav main is prakaar kii vicitra vastuon kaa astitv he, yaa ye oinstin samikarnon ke kaalpanik samaadhaan maatr he
 Einstein himself had the mistaken belief that the formation of black holes is not possible, as he believed that the angular momentum of particles leading to collapse would stabilize their motion
 isaki vajah se saamaanya saapekshata samudaay kai varshon tak iske virdohi parinaamon ko khaarij karata rahaa
 But some of them maintained the belief that black holes actually existed, and by the late 1960s they were able to convince most researchers that the creation of event horizons was indeed possible
 ek baar ek ghatana roger penros ne yah siddh kar diya ki uske bheetar kahin na kahin singulerity kaa nirmaan avashya hoga
 Shortly thereafter, Stephen Hawking demonstrated that syngularity existed in many cosmic solutions of the Big Bang, in the absence of scalar fields and other foreign matter
 kerr samaadhaan, no-hair prameya or blike hole ushmpravagiki ke niyamon ne darshaya ki blike hole ke bhautik lakshan saral hai or aasaani se samajhe ja sakate hai, inhen shodh ke sammanit vishyon kaa darja mil gaya
 It is believed that the primary process of building black holes may have been the gravitational collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but there are many other processes that can lead to the creation of black holes
 gurutveey patan tab hota he jab ek vastu kaa aantarik dabaav uske apane gurutvkarshan kaa virodh karne ke liye aparyaapt ho
 This usually occurs in stars because either the "fuel" is insufficient to maintain its temperature in the stars, or a star that was stationary would receive a lot of extra material but not raise its core temperature
 donon sthitiyon main, taare kaa taapmaana swayan ke vajan tale apane patan ko roak paane ke liye aparyaapt sabit hoga 
 This collapse can be prevented by the mutual pressure of the star components, the material condenses into an attractive dense state
 iskaa parinaam, ek prakaar kaa compact tara
 kis kism kaa compact tara banegaa yah avshesh ke drabyaman par nirbhar karegaa - patan ke kaaran hue parivartanon ke baad bache hue padaarthon nen bahari satahon ko nestnabud kar diya he
 Note that this will be much less than the original star - residues with more than 5 solar masses are produced by stars that must have been greater than 20 before their collapse
 yadi avshesh kaa dravyaman ~ 3-4 saura drabyaman se adhik ho-- kyonki mul tara yaa to bahut baari tha yaa avshesh ne atirikt drabyaman ekatra kar liya he)- neutron kaa apjaatya dabaav bhi patan ko rokane ke liye aparyaapt he
 After this, there is no known process that can stop this collapse and the object will degenerate into a black hole
 baari taron ke is gurutveey patan ko hi adhikansh taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike holon ke gathan ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 Gravitational collapse requires much higher density
 brahmad ke vartmaan yug main yah ucch ghanatv keval taron main hi milti he, lekin praarambhik brahmad main big baing ke sheeghra baad ghanatv kaaphi adhik hua karte the, ho saktaa he isi ne blike hole ke nirmaan ko sambhav banaaya ho
 High density alone is not sufficient for the creation of a black hole because the uniform distribution of masses will not allow the mass to accumulate
 is ghaney madhyam main pracheen blike holon ke gathan hetu, praarambhik ghantviya gadabadiyon kaa hona aavashyak he jo baad main swayan ke gurutv ke prabhaav main bad saken
 There are wide differences in the size of these disturbances in various models of the early universe
 vibhinn modelon ne blike hole ke nirmaan kaa purvanumaan lagaaya tha, plank dravyaman se lekar saikadon hajaaron saura drabyamanon tak ke
 Therefore, primitive black holes can be the reason for the formation of any type of black hole
 gurutveey patan hi ekmaatr prakriya nahin he jo blike hole kaa nirmaan kar sakati he
 In theory, the creation of black holes is also possible in high-energy collisions that create sufficient densities
 haalaanki, abhi tak, aisi kisi bhi aisi koi ghatana ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main, kan twarak prayogon main drabyaman santulan kii kami ke rup main nahin paaya gaya he
 This implies that there should be a lower limit to the mass of the black hole
 siddhanthata, is seemaa ko plank dravyaman ke aasapaas hona chahie, jahaan aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki kwantum prabhaav saamaanya saapekshata ke siddhant ko galat sabit kar denge
 For this reason, the possibility of creation of a black hole on or around the Earth can be completely ruled out
 haalaanki, kwantum gurutv ke kuch vikaas aisa darshaate hai ki is bandha kii seemaa kaaphi neeche ho sakati he
 For example, some Brainworld landscapes keep the Planck mass far below, perhaps as low as 1 tev / c2
 yah, sookshm blike hole ke nirmaan ko ucch urja takkaron yaa CERN ke vishaal hadran colider main sambhav kar saktaa he
 However, all these theories are quite imaginary and many scientists are of the opinion that the creation of black holes in these processes is not possible
 ek baar banane ke baad blike hole, atirikt padaarthon ke avasorana dwaara viksit hona jari rakhata he
 All black holes will continue to absorb interstellar dust and ubiquitous radiation, but none of these processes have any significant effect on the mass of a stellar black hole
 adhik mahatvapurn yogadan tab hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa nirmaan ek dwiadhari tara pranali main hoti he
 The black hole can absorb a large amount of matter from its partner after formation
 atyadhik bade yogadan tab praapt hote hai jab ek blike hole kaa anya taron yaa compact vastuon se vilay hota he
 The supermassive black holes at the center of most galaxies may have been formed by the merger of many smaller objects
 isi prakriya ko kuch madhyavarti drabyaman vaale blike holon ke nirmaan ke liye bhi prastaavit kiya gaya he
 As an object moves towards the event horizon, the horizon begins to swell and swallow it
 iske sheeghra baad trigya kaa vistaar puure hole main samaan rup se vitarit ho jaataa he
 In 1974, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes are not completely black, but they also emit small amounts of thermal radiation
 unhen yah parinaam mila ek sthir blike hole prishthbhumi main pramaatra kshetra siddhant kaa prayog karke
 The result of their equations is that a black hole must leave particles in an ideal black body spectrum
 yah prabhaav hawking vikiran ke rup main janaa gaya
 Since the Hawking result, many have verified this effect through various methods
 yadi blike hole vikiran kaa yah siddhant sahi he, to aisi apeksha kii jaati he ki blike hole vikiran ke tapiya kiranpunj ko nikaalenge or isse drabyaman kaa kshay hoga, kyonki saapekshata siddhant ke anusaar drabyaman ucch sanghanit urja maatr he 
 samay ke saath blike hole sikud kar hawa main ud jaayenge
 The temperature of this beam remains proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, which in turn is inversely proportional to mass
 isliye bade blike hole chote blike hole se kam vikiran chhodte hai
 The Hawking temperature of a stellar black hole with 5 solar masses is about 12 nanokelvins
 yah antarikshawya sookshm-tarang prishthbhumi dwaara utpaadit 2
7K se kaaphi kam he
 Black holes with stellar mass gain more mass than they emit through Hawking radiation from the cosmic microwave background, so they spread rather than shrink
 2
7 k se adhik hawking taapmaana praapt karne ke liye, ek blike hole ko chandramaa se bhi halkaa hona padegaa 
 On the other hand if a black hole is very small, it is expected that its radiation effect will be very powerful
 ek blike hole jo manushyon kii tulana main bhi baari he, kshan main lupt ho jaayegaa
 a black hole weighing a car will take only one nanosecond to evaporate, during which time its brightness will exceed 200 times that of the sun
 halke blike hole se ummid kii jaati he ki ve or bhi teji se vashpit ho jaayenge, udhaaharan ke liye 1 tev / c 2 drabyaman vaala ek blike hole puri tarah lupt hone main 10−88 second se bhi kam samay lagayegaa
 Of course, for such a small black hole the quantum gravity effect is expected to play an important role and even - although recent developments in quantum gravity provide no clue to it - hypothetically such small black holes are stable Will be adhikansh abhivruddhi discs tathaa gas jet kii maujuudagi taarakeey drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa spasht saboot nahin he, kyonki neutron taare or safed bunon jaisi anya adhik drabyaman vaali or ati ghani vasteen abhivruddhi discon or gas dhaaraon ke nirmaan kaa kaaran ho sakati hai or unka vyavhaar vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa blike hole ke irdagird hota he
 But they can often help astronomers by telling them where the search for a black hole can prove to be fruitful
 magar duusari taraf, ati vishaal abhivruddhi discs or gas dharaaen atyadhik drabyaman vaale blike hole kii upasthiti kaa acha saboot ho sakati hai, kyonki jahaan tak ham jaanate hai keval ek blike hole hi in ghatnaon kii utpatti kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 Static X-rays and gamma ray emissions also do not prove the presence of a black hole, but can tell astronomers where to search would be fruitful - and they have the advantage of being able to easily detect clouds of gas and gas Get out lekin shaktishaalee, aniyamit eks-re, gamma kirane or anya vidyut-chumbakeey vikiran yah sabit karne main madad kar sakate hai ki vah vishaal, ati ghani vastu ek blike hole nahin he, taaki "blike hole akhetak" kisi anya vastu kii taraf dhyaan kendrit kar saken
 Neutron stars and other very dense wires have surfaces and the collision with the surface at a high percentage of the speed of light emits intense flames of radiation at irregular intervals
 blike hole main koi thos sataha nahin hoti he, isliye kisi atyadhik drabyaman vaali ati saghan vastu ke irdagird aniyamit antaraal par vikiran kii gahan lapaton kaa abhaav, yah darshata he ki vahaan ek blike hole ke milane kii acchhee sambhaavna ho sakati he
 The intense but single-handed release of the gamma ray may indicate the birth of a "new" black hole, as astrophysicists think that the cause of grbs is either the gravitational collapse of a massive star or a collision between neutron stars, And both these events involve enough mass and pressure to create a black hole
 lekin aisa prathit hota he ki ek neutron taare or ek blike hole ke bich kaa takaraav bhi ek GRB paidaa kar saktaa he, isliye ek GRB saboot nahin he ki ek "nae" blike hole kaa gathan hua he
 All known grbs come from outside our own galaxy and most come from billions of light years away, so the black holes associated with them are actually billions of years old
 kuch antariksh-bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he ki kuch ati chamkile eks-re strot madhyavarti-drabyaman vaale blike hole ke abhivruddhi discs ho sakate hai
 Kasars are believed to be the accretion disks of a highly massaging black hole, as no known object is so powerful that it can emit so powerful
 qasaar puure vidyut-chumbakeey spectrum main shaktishaalee utsarjan utpann karte hai, jisamen shaamil hai yuvi, eks-re or gamma-kiran or apni ucch chamak ke kaaran ye kaaphi duuri se bhi dikhaai dete hai
 Between 5 and 25 percent of the quasars are "radio loud", a noun due to their powerful radio emission
 ek gurutveey lens kaa nirmaan tab hota he jab kisi bahut dur sthit ujjwal strot se aati hui prakaash kii kirane kisi vishalkay vastu ke aasapaas "mud" jaati hai, darshak or strot vastu ke bich
 is prakriya ko gurutveey lencing ke rup main janaa jaataa he or yah saamaanya saapekshata siddhant kii bhavishyavaaniyon main se ek he
 According to this theory, space "time" assimilates to create mass gravitational fields and therefore bend light as a result
 lens ke peeche ke strot kii chhavi ek paryvekshak ko kai chhaviyon ke rup main dikhaai pad sakati he
 If the source, the heavy lensing object and the observer are in a straight line, the source will appear as a ring behind the heavy object
 gurutveey lencing blike hole ke alaava anya vastuon ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he, kyonki koi bhi ati shaktishaalee gurutvkarshan kshetra prakaash kirnon ko modane kii kshamta rakhata he
 Some of these multi-image effects are probably caused by remotely located galaxies
 blike hole kii parikrama karti vasteen, kendriya vastu ke aasapaas ke gurutvkarshan kshetra kaa anveshan karti rahati hai
 An older example, discovered in the 1970s, is the accretion disk orbiting around the fictitious black hole responsible for Cygnus X-1, a well-known X-ray source
 haalaanki swayan padaarth ko to sidhe taur par nahin dekha ja saktaa, eksre kii timatimaahat mili secondon main jari rahati he, jaisaa ki lagbhag das saura drabyaman vaale ek blike hole ke chaaron ore parikrama karne vaale kisi garm pind rupi padaarth se abhivruddhi se thik pehle ummid kii jaati he
 The x-ray spectrum represents the specific shape that is expected from a disc containing orbiting relativistic materials, with an iron line emitted at ~ 6
4 kev, and widened to red and blue
 ek anya udhaaharan he S2 tara jise akashgangeey centre kii parikrama karte dekha jaataa he
 This star is several light hours away from a black hole with a ~ 3
5 × 106 solar mass, so its rotation speed can be noted
 paryvekshit kaksha ke centre main kuch bhi dikhaai nahin detaa he, jaisaa ki ek kaali vastu se ummid kii jaati he
 Semi-periodic oscillations can be used to determine the mass of a black hole
 yah takanic blike hole or uske aasapaas kii discon ke bhitari bhaag ke bich ke sambandh kaa upyog karti he, jahaan gas ghatana kshitij tak pahunchne se pehle bheetar kii ore ghumaavdaar rup main aati rahati he
 As the gas collapses inward, it transmits x-ray radiation whose intensity is less than a certain order and which repeats itself at a regular interval
 yah sanketak ardh-aavadhik dolan yaa QPO kehalaata he
 The frequency of a QPO depends on the mass of the black hole; The smaller black hole has an event horizon located close to it, so the QPO has a higher frequency
 adhik dravyaman vaale blike hole ke liye, ghatana kshitij kaaphi aage baahar kii ore hota he, isliye QPO aavriti kam hoti he
 It is now widely accepted that every galaxy, or nearly every one, has a supermassive black hole at its center
 is blike hole ke dravyaman or mejabaan akashganga ke ubhaar ke bich jo najdiki sahasambandh he, vah yah darshata he ki akashganga or blike hole ke nirmaan ke bich kaaphi gaharaa sambandh he
 For decades, astronomers used the term "active galaxy" to describe galaxies that had unusual characteristics, such as unusual spectral line emission and super-powerful radio emission
 haalanki, saidhantik or paryvekshaniya adhyayan dikhaate hai ki in akashgangaon ke sakriy gangey nabhik main ati vishalkay blike hole ho sakate hai
 These AGN models have a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times heavier than the sun; a gas and dust disk called accretion disk; And two currents that are perpendicular to the accretion disk
 haalaanki, ummid kii jaati he ki ati vishalkay blike hole lagbhag sabhi AGN main paae jaayenge, sirf kuch hi akashgangaon ke nabhikon kaa dhyaan purvak adhyayan kiya gaya he is prayaas main ki centrestha ati vishalkay blike hole ummidavaaron kii pahchaan or vaastavik dravyaman kii maap, donon kii ja sake
 Examples of such notable galaxies are the Andromeda galaxy, M32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and the Sombrero galaxy
 khagolavidon kaa vishwaas he ki hamaari apni akashganga ke centre main ek ati vishalkay blike hole sthit he, segitarius A* naamak kshetra main, kyonki: In 2002, observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope indicate that there are likely to be intermediate-mass black holes in spherical clusters called M15 and G1
 yah vyakhya golakaar samoohon main taron ke kaksha ke aakaar or avadhi par aadhaarit he
 But the Habbal proof is not conclusive, because a group of neutron stars can be the reason for such observations
 haal kii khojon tak, kai khagolvid sochate the ki golakaar samoohon main jatil gurutvkarshan antah-kriyaayen nae bane blike holon ko nishkasit kar dengi
 In November 2004, a team of astronomers reported the discovery of the first and fully verified intermediate-mass black hole of our galaxy, orbiting 3 light years away from Segitarius a *
 1300 saura dravyaman vaala yah blike hole saat taron ke ek samooh ke bich main he, sambhawatah yah ek vishaal tara samooh kaa avshesh he jo akaash ganga ke centre se chhitak gaya he
 This observation confirms that supermassive black holes grow by absorption of nearby small black holes and stars
 janvari 2007 main, united kingdom ke southempton vishvavidhyalay main shodhakartaaon ne ek blike hole kii khoj kii soochna di, yah sambhawatah 10 saura dravyamanon waal tha or NGC 4472 naamak ek akashganga main sthit tha, lagbhag 5

 Our galaxy contains many possible stellar-mass black holes, which are closer to us than the supermassive black holes in the Sagittarian a * region
 ye sabhi ummidavaar eks-re dwiadhari pranaaliyon ke sadsy hai jisamen adhik ghani vastu apane saathi se ek abhivruddhi discs ke madhyam se padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he
 The black holes in these pairs can range from three to more than a dozen solar masses
 ab tak awalokit taarakeey dravyaman vaale blike holon main durtam, mesiye 33 akashganga main sthit dwiadhari pranali kaa sadsy he
 Theoretically there is no minimum size for a black hole
 ek baar inaki rachana ho jane par, inamen blike hole ke gun aa jate hai
 Stephen Hawking proposed that supermassive black holes can evaporate and become more microscopic, that is, micro black holes
 vashpit hote atiprarambhik blike hole kii khoj hetu fermi gamma-re spes telescope ko prastaavit kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa prakshepan 11 june 2008 ko kiya gaya tha
 However, if microscopic black holes can be formed in other ways, such as by the impact of space rays or in colliders, this does not mean that they must certainly evaporate
 dharti par kan twarakon main blike hole ke anuroopon kaa nirmaan hone kii soochna he
 These black holes are not the same as the corresponding gravitational black holes, but they are important for examining the principles of gravity quantification
 ve majboot nabhikeey shakti ke siddhant ke anuroop hone kii vajah se blike hole kii tarah vyavhaar karte hai, jinka gurutvkarshan or gurutvkarshan ke pramaatra siddhant se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 They are similar because both are described by string theory
 atah quark gluon plasma main aag ke gole ke gathan or vighatan kii vyakhya blike hole kii bhashaa main kii ja sakati he
 The fireball phenomenon in the relativistic heavy ion collider is very close to that of a black hole, and many of its physical properties can be predicted correctly using this analog
 aag kaa gola, haalaanki, ek gurutveey vastu nahin he
 It is not currently known whether a more energetic Large Hadron Collider will be capable of producing larger black holes with larger extra dimensions than expected, as suggested by several researchers
 adhik gaharaai se charchaa ke liye dekhen: large hadran colider main kan takaraav kii suraksha
 General relativity describes the possibility of a configuration in which two black holes are connected to each other
 is tarah ke vinyas ko aamtaur par ek varmhole kaha jaataa he
 Wormholes have inspired writers of fictional science fiction because they provide a means to quickly travel long distances, including time travel
 vyavhaar main, khagol bhautikee main aise vinyas lagbhag asambhav si baat hai, kyonki koi bhi gyaat prakriya in vastuon ke nirmaan kii anumati detii prathit nahin hoti he
 In 1971, Stephen Hawking showed that the total area of the event horizon of any collection of traditional black holes cannot be reduced even if they collide and swallow each other, that is, merge
 yah ullekhneey rup se ushmpravagiki ke dwitiya niyam ke samaan he, jahaan kshetra entropy kii bhoomika adaa karata he
 It was believed that the black hole entropy would be zero because of the zero temperature
 yadi aisa hota to entropy-krit padaarth ke blike hole main pravesh se ushmpravagiki ke duusare niyam kaa ulanghan hota tha, parinamswaroop brahmad kii kul entropy main kami aani chahie thi
 Therefore, Jacob Beckenstein proposed that a black hole needs an entropy and it should be proportional to the event horizon
 chunki blike hole paaramparik rup se vikiran nahin chhodte he, ushmpravagiki drushtikon ek anuroop maatr prathit hota he, kyonki shunya taapmaana kaa arth he ooshmaa ke kisi bhi yoga se entropy main anant parivartanon kaa hona, jiskaa arth he anant entropy
 However, in 1974, Hawking applied quantum field theory to curved space-time near the event horizon and found that black holes emit Hawking radiation, which is a kind of thermal radiation and is associated with the impact, which implies that That they have a positive temperature
 isane blike hole gatishiltaa or ushmpravagiki ke bich ke anurupan ko bal pradaan kiya: blike hole yantriki ke pehle niyam kaa upyog karte hue, yah nishkarsh niklaa ja saktaa he ki ek gaiyr-chakrit blike hole kii entropy uske ghatana kshitij ke kshetra kii ek chauthai hogi
 This is a universal consequence and can be applied to the entire cosmic horizon, such as in the De Sittar space field
 baad main yah suzav aayaa ki ek blike hole adhiktam entropy vaali vastu he, arthath antariksh ke kisi ek kshetra kii adhiktam sambhav entropy us kshetra main samaa sakane vaale sabase bade blike hole kii entropy hogi
 This led to the creation of holographic theory
 hawking vikiran blike hole ke vishisht taapmaana ko darshata he, jisaki gananaa uski entropy se kii ja sakati he
 The higher the temperature falls, the more massive the black hole becomes: the more energy it absorbs, the more cold it becomes
 budh grah ke lagbhag dravyaman vaale blike hole main akashiya sookshm-tarang vikiran ke santulan main taapmaana hota he 
 When heavier than this, a black hole will be cooler than background radiation and it will receive energy from the background much faster than the energy emitted through Hawking radiation, it will also cool down
 haalaanki, ek kam baari blike hole main yah prabhaav yah darshaayegaa ki blike hole kaa dravyaman samay ke saath dhire dhire vashpit ho kar ud jaayegaa, jabaki blike hole aisa karte hue or adhik garam hota jaayegaa
 While these effects are negligible for black holes that are sufficiently heavy to be formed internally, they will become increasingly important for imaginary small black holes, where quantum-mechanical effects dominate
 vastav main, chote blike hole sambhawatah drut gati se vashpit honge or antat vikiran ke ek visphot ke saath lupt ho jaayenge
 Although general relativity can be used to calculate the entropy of a black hole, this condition is in principle not satisfactory
 sankhyikeey yantriki main, entropy kaa arth ek pranali kii sookshm vinyas kii sankhya kii gananaa ke rup main samajha jaataa he jinamein samaan sookshm gun ho 
 But without a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity, such a calculation is not possible for a black hole
 haalaanki, string siddhant dwaara thodi aashaa jagaai gayi he, jiske anusaar blike hole kii swatantraaa kii sookshm maatra D-breance he
 By calculating the states of D-branes by the charge and energy provided, the entropy measurements of some particularly highly symmetric black holes can be obtained
 in gananaaon kii vaidhata ke kshetra ko vistrut karnaa, anusandhanon ke liye ek jari kaary kshetra he
 The so-called information loss paradox, or black hole centralization paradox, is an open question in fundamental physics
 paaramparik rup se, bhautik vigyaan ke niyam samaan hi rahenge, aage kii taraf badhen yaa peeche jaaen 
 That is, if the position and velocity of each particle of the universe is measured, we can work backwards to discover the history of the past universe at will
 luvil prameya fez spes volum ke sangrakshan kaa varnan karata he, jise "jaankaree ke sangrakshan" ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he, isliye sthapit bhautikee main bhi kuch samasya avashya he
 In quantum mechanics, this coincides with an important property called centralization, which is concerned with the conservation of probability
 haalaanki, blike hole is niyam kaa ulanghan kar sakate hai
 Under the established general relativity, this situation is subtle but clear: due to the established no-hair theorem, it can never be determined what went inside the black hole? However, when viewed from the outside, the information is never actually destroyed, as matter falling into a black hole takes infinite time to reach the event horizon
 is baat par jor dena aavashyak he ki saamaanya saapekshata ke sameekaran asal main tii-samarupata kaa paalan karte hai or yah tathy ki uparokt tark saamaanya saapekshata ke aplicoshan se hi aata he, hamen thodaa satark ho janaa chahie
 This is due to the fact that it is not possible by time-symmetric theory to reach time-reversal-asymmetric conclusions, which in this case is general relativity
 rindller nirdeshaank, jo ek bahari darshak ke liye ghatana kshitij ke nikat lagu hote hai, tii-samamit hai atah "aparivartaneey" prakriya jaisi kisi cheez ke astitv ko nakaara ja saktaa he
 It is possible that the "paradox" is the result of applying the time-asymmetric limit to the time-symmetric principle, making it a variant of the logistic paradox
 duusari ore, pramaatra gurutv ke bare main vichaar, yah suzav dete hai ki vahaan keval ek simit parimit utkram maap ho sakati he jo kshitij ke paas ke antariksh se sambandhit hogi: lekin kshitij ke utkram maap main parivartan or hawking vikiran kaa utkram maap sarvatha paryaapt hota he un padaarth or urja ke sabhi utkram maapon ko apane main samahit karne ke liye jo blike hole main gir rahen hon
 However, many physicists worry that it is still not properly understood
 khaas kar, ek pramaatra str par, hawking vikiran kii pramaatra avasthaa nirdhaarit hoti he keval is baat se ki blike hole main purv main kya gir chukaa he; or itihaas ki blike hole main kya gira tha ekmaatr nirdhaarit hoti he blike hole or vikiran ke pramaatra avasthaa dwaara
 This determinism and centralization will be required
 lambey samay tak stephen hawking ne is vichaar kaa birodh kiya, apni mul 1975 kii sthiti par ve ade rahe ki hawking vikiran puri tarah se tapiya he isliye purnataya avyavasthit he, blike hole dwaara purv main nigle gaye padaarthon kii koi bhi jaankaree maujuud nahin rahati he; unhonen tark diya ki is jaankaree kaa lop ho chukaa he
 However, on 21 July 2004, he introduced a new argument, contrary to his previous argument
 is nai gananaa main, blike hole se sambandhit utkram maap nikalakar hawking vikiran main hi jaataa he
 However, it is also difficult to understand in theory until the black hole completes its evaporation
 tab tak hawking vikiran kii jaankaree or vyavastha kii praarambhik avasthaa main 1:1 tareeke se sambhddha sthapit karnaa asambhav he
 Once the black holes evaporate completely, they can be identified and the centralization in them is preserved
 jis samay hawking ne apni gananaa puri kii, yah ads / CFT sambandh ke dwaara kaaphi spasht ho chukaa tha ki blike hole kaa kshay ekaatmak tareeke se hota he
 Because in gauge theories the fire spheres, which correspond to Hawking radiation, are definitely unitary
 hawking kii nai gananaa kaa visheshgy vaigyanik samudaay dwaara moolyankan nahin kiya gaya he, kyonki unke upyog kiye tareeke anjaane or sandigdh anurupata vaale hai
 But Hawking himself expressed enough confidence in it to pay for a bet he had made in 1997 with Caltech physicist John Preskill, which the media was interested in
 leonard saskind or nobel puraskaar vijeta jerard tii hooft ne yah suzav diya he ki blike hole ke chaaron or ke triayami antariksh ko ghatana kshitij ke ek dwiaiami vyavhaar dwaara purna rup se varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 They believe in this because this black hole can solve the information-loss paradox

 Although Pakhtun calls himself Israel, but religiously, he is a Muslim, not a Jew
 alexander bern ne hi punah 1837 main likhaa ki jab usne us samay ke afakhaan raja dost mohammad se iske bare main poocha to uskaa jawaab tha ki uski praja bani israel he isamen andeh nahin lekin isamen bhi andeh nahin ki ve log musalmaan hai evam aadhunik yahudiyon kaa samarthan nahin karenge

 There is a district of Maharashtra which was the capitol of Vakataka
 vaakatak rajaaone 200 saal raaj kiyavatsagulm shakhasrvasen tritiy vindhyasen pravarasen dwitiya agyaat devsen harisen Vakataka vaakatak shabd kaa prayog pracheen bharat ke ek rajvansh ke liye kiya jaataa he jisane teesri sadi ke madhya se chhathi sadi tak shashan kiya tha
 Why that dynasty was related to this name is difficult to answer correctly
 syat vakaat naam kaa madhyabhaarat main koi sthaan rahaa ho, jahaan par shashan karanevaala vansh vaakatak kahalaaya
 Hence the first king is called "vakataka Vansketu:" in the Ajanta article
 is rajvansh kaa shashan madhyapradesh ke adhik bhubhag tathaa pracheen baraar par vistrut tha, jiske sarvapratham shaasha vindhyasakti kaa naam vayupurana tathaa ajantalekh me miltaa he
 Possibly the first king was conferred with the title of 'vindhyashakti' due to his rule over the Vindhya mountain region
 is naresh kaa pramanik itivrutt upasthit karnaa kathin he, kyonki vindhyashakti kaa koi abhilekh yaa sikaa abhi tak uplabdh nahin ho sakaa
 The decline of the Satavahana kingdom in the middle of the third century gave Vindhyashakti an opportunity even if its fame could not be sustained
 uske putr pratham pravarasen ne vansh kii pratishtha ko amar bana diya
 Studies of the inscriptions reveal that the first Pravarsena performed four Ashwamedha and held the title of emperor in the kingdom to elaborate on the south
 pravarasen ke samakaleen shaktishaalee naresh ke abhaav main vaakatak rajya andhrapradesh tathaa madhyabhaarat main vistrut ho gaya
 The subordinate ruler of Baghelkhand, Vyaghraja, is also mentioned in Samudragupta's column
 sambhavat: pravarasen ne chauthi sadi ke pratham charan main purvadakshin bharat, malwa, gujarat, kathiyawad par adhikaar kar liya tha parantu isaki pushti ke liye sabal pramaan nahin milte
 It is certain that Pravarsen's influence spread to the south
 parantu kitne bhaag par vah sidhaa shashan karata rahaa, yah spasht nahin he
 It is perfectly fair to say that it was his task to transform the Vakataka kingdom as an empire
 pratham pravarasen ne vaidic yagyon se isaki pushti kii he
 In the middle of the fourth century, his grandson succeeded the first Rudrasen kingdom, because Pravarsen's eldest son Gotamiputra had already died
 mansar main pravarasen dwitiya dwaara nirmit pravareshwar shiv mandir ke bhagnavasheshvakatak vansh ke tisare shaasha maharaj rudrasen pratham kaa itihaas atyant vivaadaaspad mana jaataa he
 Initially he could not consolidate his position due to objections and weakness
 kuch vidvan yah maanate hai ki uske pitruvy samrajya ko vibhajit kar shashan karnaa chaahate the, kintu pitruvy sarvasen ke atirikt kisi kaa vrittant prapya nahin he
 Sarvesen had established his dominion in the southwestern part of the Vakataka kingdom, where his descendants ruled for the fifth century
 is prasang main yah maan lenaa sahi hoga ki uske naanaa bhaarshiv maharaj bhavanag ne rudrasen pratham kii visham paristhiti main sahaayta kii, jiske falswaroop rudrasen apni satta ko drudh kar sakaa
 With regard to the destruction of this Vakataka king, some people hold the false belief that Rudrasen i was destroyed by the rise of the Gupta dynasty
 gupt samrat samudragupta ne kaushambi ke yuddh main vaakatak naresh rudrasen pratham ko maar daalaa iske putr prithvishen pratham ne kuntal par vijay kar dakshin bharat main vaakatak vansh ko shaktishaalee banaaya
 Because of his important location, the Gupta emperor Chandragupta had to marry his daughter to the crown prince Rudrasen
 is vaivaahik sambandh ke kaaran gupt prabhaav dakshin bharat main atyadhik ho gaya
 As a result, the second Rudrasen, when he ascended the throne, supported his brother in the campaign of Kathiawad victory
 dwitiya rudrasen kii akaal mrityu ke kaaran uski patni prabhavati gupta apraptavyask putron kii sangrakshika ke rup main shashan karne lagi
 Second Chandragupta also gave active support by becoming the well-wisher of Vakataka rule
 patliputra se sahakaari karmchaaree niyukt kiye gaye
 This was the reason that the Gupta dynasty is mentioned in Prabhavati Gupta's Punatambrapatra
 kalantar main yuvaraj damodarasen dwitiya pravarasen ke naam se singhaasana par baitha, kintu is vansh ke lekh yah batalaate hai ki pravarasen se dwitiya prithvishen paryant kisi prakaar kaa ran abhiyaan na ho sakaa
 Towards the end of the fifth century, the royalty passed into the hands of the ruler of Venimashakha, Harshana, who in the Ajanta article called the conquerors of the Kuntal, Avanti, Lat, Kosala, Kalinga and Andhra countries, was defeated by the Vakataka dynasty due to the weakening of the heirs
 ajanta gufaaon main shail ko katkar nirmit buddha bihar evam chaityas vaakatak samrajya ke vatsagulm shakha ke raajaaon ke sangrakshan main bane the
 It is known from the study of records that the state of Vakataka in South India has been magnificent, strong and proud
 saanskrithik utthan main bhi is vansh ne haath bataya tha
 In the Prakrit poems, "setubandha" and "harivijay Kavya" are considered to be the works of Pravarsena II and Sarvasen respectively
 vaise praakrit kavy tathaa subhashit ko "vaidarbhi style" kaa naam diya gaya he
 Vakataknaresh was a follower of Vedic religion, hence the description of many yagyas are found in the articles
 kala ke kshetra main bhi iskaa kaary prashansaneey rahaa he
 Ajanta's painting received greater impetus in the Vakataka era, which is considered to be a unique mural in the world
 naachna kaa mandir bhi isi yug main nirmit hua or usee vaastukala kaa anukaran kar udaygiri, devgarh evam ajanta main guhanirmaan hua tha
 The practice of all subjects shows that the Vakataka king showed special affection in cultural upliftment than in the state
 yahi is vash kii visheshta he

 The year of 2249 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India

 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 gurjar pratihaar vansh madhyakaal ke dauraan madhya-uttar bharat ke ek bade hisse main rajya karne vaala rajvansh tha, jisaki sthapana nagabhatta naamak ek samant ne 725 i main kii thi
 People of this dynasty considered themselves descendants of Rama's Anuj Laxman, who served his brother Rama like Pratihara on a special occasion
 is rajvansh kii utpatti, pracheen kaaleen gwalior prashasti abhilekh se gyaat hoti he
 In its golden period, the Gurjara Pratihara Empire stretched from the Sutlej River in the west to the Himalayan foothills in the north and bengal-assam in the east to the Saurashtra and Narmada rivers in the south
 samraat mihir bhoj, is rajvansh kaa sabase pratapi or mahaan raja the
 Arab writers describe the period of Mihirbhoja as a prosperous period
 itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki gurjar pratihaar rajvansh ne bharat ko arab hamalon se lagbhag 300 varshon tak bachaaye rakhaa tha, isliye gurjar pratihaar naam padaa
 The empire that the Gurjara Pratiharas built in North India was larger and more organized than Harshavardhana's empire in expansion
 desh ke rajnatik ekikaran karke, shanti, samruddhi or samskruti, sahitya or kala aadi main vruddhi tathaa pragati kaa vaataavaran taiyaar karne kaa shrey gurjar pratihaaron ko hi jaataa hai
 The characteristic of Gurjara Pratihara temples and the sculpture of the idols show the richness of Gurjara Pratihara style of that time
 gwalior prashasti abhilekh se is vansh ke bare main kai mahatvapurn bate gyaat hoti he
 Nagabhatta i is considered the first king of this dynasty
 aathvin shatabdi main bharat main arabon kaa akraman shuru ho chukaa tha
 Sindh and Multan had their authority

 But further, on the Avanti, Nagabhatta drove him

 After expelling the Arabs, Nagabhatta proceeded without stopping there

 He established his capital at Avanti in Malwa, and prevented the expansion of the Arabs, who had established themselves in Sindh

 Nagabhatta was followed by two weak successors, followed by Vatsaraja who further expanded the empire
 harshavardhan kii mrityu ke baad kannauj ko shakti nirvaat kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jiske parinamswaroop harsh ke samrajya kaa vighatan hone laga
 Which was eventually filled by Yashovarman after almost a century
 lekin uski sthiti bhi lalitaditya muktpid ke saath gathbandhan par nirbhar thi
 When Muktapida weakened Yashovarman, a triangular struggle for control over the city developed, including the Pratihara kingdom from the west and north region, the Pala kingdom of Bengal from the east and the Rashtrakuta kingdom in the Deccan in the south
 vatsaraj ne kannauj ke niyantran ke liye paal shaasha dharmpal or rashtrakut raja dantidurg ko safaltaapurvak chunauti di or parajeet kar do rajachhatron par kabja kar liya
 Around 786, the Rashtrakuta ruler Dhruva Dharwars crossed the Narmada river to Malwa and tried to capture Kannauj from there
 lagbhag 800 i0 main vatsaraj ko dhruv dharvarsha ne parajeet kiya or use marudesh main sharan lene ko majabur kar diya
 And its gate also captured the territories won by Gondraj
 vatsaraj ko pun: apane puraane kshetra jalon se shashan karnaa pada, dhruv ke prayaavartan ke saath hi paal naresh dharmpal ne kannauj par kabja kar, waha apane adheen chakrayudh ko raja bana diya
 His son Nagabhatta II became the king after Vatsaraja, he was initially defeated by the Rashtrakuta ruler Govind III, but later he regained his power and wrested Malwa from the Rashtrakutas
 tadanusaar usne andhra, sindh, vidarbha or kaling ke raajaaon ko haraa kar apane adheen kar liya
 Conquered Kannauj by defeating Chakraudh

 usne pratihaar samrajya ko ganga ke maidan main aage patliputra tak failaa diya
 Further, he again stopped Muslims in the West
 usne gujarat main somnath ke mahaan shiv mandir ko punah banwaaya, jise sindh se arab hamalen main tod diya gaya tha
 Kannauj became the center of the gurjara-pratihara state, during the height of its power, they held most of northern India
 833 i0 main nagabhatta ke jalsamadhi ke baad, uskaa putr rambhadra yaa ram gurjar pratihaar samrajya kaa aglaa raja bana
 Rambhadra stopped all his opponents on the strength of his feudal horseman Saina

 And he was successful in taking the Kalinger region from Gurjar Pratiharas
 rambhadra ke baad uskaa putr mihirbhoj yaa bhoj pratham ne gurjar pratihaar kii satta sanbhali
 The reign of Mihirbhoj is considered a golden period for the Pratihara Empire
 arab lekhakon ne mihirbhoj ke kaal ko sampann kaal bataate hai
 During the reign of Mihirbhoj, the kingdom of Kannauj expanded more
 uskaa rajya uttar-pashchim main satulaj, uttar main himalay kii tarai, purv main paal samrajya ki pashchimi seemaa, dakshin-purv main bundelkhand or vatsa kii seemaa, dakshin-pashchim main saurashtra, tathaa pashchim main rajasthan ke adhikansh bhaag main failaa hua tha

 In the end, the banquet was won in this pal-pratihara Sanghars
 dakshin ki ore mihirbhoj ke samay amoghvarsh or krishna dwitiya rashtrakut shashan kar rahe the
 Hence, there was peace between the Gurjara pratihara-rashtrakutas during this period, although a fragmentary article in the Varato Museum shows that there was a war between the Bhoja and the Rashtrakuta king Krishna II near the Narmada River for authority over Avanti
 jisamen rashtrakuton ko waapas lautnaa padaa tha
 The rule of Gurjara Pratiharas on the Avanti continued from the tenure of Bhoja to the reign of Mahendrapal II

 This temple was destroyed by a landslide in 1880
 baad main ise dubaara banaaya gaya
 The Shakti form of Sati is worshiped here
 mandir main do netra hai jo naina devi ko darshaate hai
 About Naini Lake, it is believed that when Shiva was going to Mount Kailash with the dead body of Sati, Shaktipeeths were established wherever his body parts fell
 naini jhil ke sthaan par devi sati kii aankh giri thi
 Inspired by this, this temple has been established
 maan naina devi kii aseem krupa hameshaa apane bhakton par rahati he
 Every year the fair of Maa Naina Devi is held in Nainital
 puranic katha ke anusaar daksh prajapati kii putree uma kaa vivaah shiv se hua tha
 Daksha Prajapati did not like Shiva, but he could not defer the requests of the gods, so he did not want his daughter to marry Shiva
 ek baar daksh prajapati ne sabhi devataaon ko apane yahan yajna main bulaayaa, parantu apane damaad shiv or beti uma ko nimantran tak nahin diya
 Uma stubbornly reached this yagna
 jab usne haridwar sthit canarvan main apane pita ke yajna main sabhi devataaon kaa sammaan or apana or apane pati kaa niraadar hote hue dekha to vah atyant du:khee ho gayi
 In the Havan Kund of the yagna, she jumped and said, "I will make Shiva my husband in the next life too
" aapane meraa or mere pati kaa jo niraadar kiya iske pratifal - swarup yajna ke havan - kund main syvan jalakar aapke yajna ko asafal karti hoon
 'when Shiva came to know that Uma became Sati, his anger was no longer in the cross
 unhone apane ganon ke dwaara daksh prajapati ke yajna ko nasht-bhrasht kar daalaa
 All the Gods and Gods, seeing this insurmountable form of Shiva, started thinking that Shiva should not be destroyed
 isliye devi-devataaon ne mahadev shiv se prarthana kii or unke krodh ke shant kiya
 Daksha Prajapati also apologized
 shiv ne unako bhi aashirwad diya
 However, upon seeing Sati's burnt body, his quietness swelled
 unhone sati ke jaale hue sharir ko kandhe par daalkar akaash - bhraman karnaa shuru kar diya
 In such a situation, wherever the parts of the body fell, there were power backs
 jahaan par sati ke nayan gire the, vahiin par nainadevi ke rup main uma arthath nanda devi kaa bhavy sthaan ho gaya
 Today's Nainital is the place where the Nain of that goddess fell
 nayanon kii ashrudhar ne yahan par taal kaa rup le liya
 Since then, Shivpathi Nanda is worshiped here as Naina Devi
 yah bhi ek vishisht udhaaharan he ki samast gadhwal-kumaun kii ekmaatr isht devi 'nanda' hi he
 The manner in which Nanda is worshiped and archana is done in this mountain region is not seen elsewhere
 nainital ke taal kii banaavat bhi dekhen to vah aankh kii akruti kaa 'taal' he
 Due to its mythological importance, the superiority of this pool is highly regarded

 Nanda was also the favored goddess of the Chand kings of Kumaon, whom he used to come and worship here continuously

 But there is no point in this story, because Nanda has been accepted as the presiding deity in all the mountainous regions
 gadhwal or kumaun ke raajaaon kii bhi nanda devi isht rahi he
 Every year special worship of Nandaparvati is done on the day of Nanda Ashtami by the people of Garhwal and Kumaon
 nanda ke maayke se sasuraal bhejne ke liye bhi 'nanda jaat' kaa aayojan gadhwal-kumaun kii janata nirantar karti rahi he

 The lake here is the main attraction of Nainital

 This lake is one of 64 Shakti Peethas

 The reflection of the surrounding mountains is seen in the water of the lake

 As early as dusk, the tourists from the plains congregate at the Mallital flat
 yahan nit naye khel - tamaashe hote rahete hai
 During the evening, when the whole of Nainital starts to glow in the light of the urban electricity, it seems as if the whole city has been drowned in this rhythm
 sandhya samay tallital se mallital ko aane vaale sailaaniyon kaa tantaa sa lag jaataa he
 In the same way, the convoy of nature lovers from Mallital to Tallital is viewable
 nainital, paryatakon, sailaaniyon, padaarohiyon or parvatarohiyon kaa chaheta nagar he jise dekhne prati varsh hajaaron log yahan aate hai
 There are some travelers who come only with the desire to visit Nainital to see "naini Devi" and get the blessings of that goddess
 yah devi koi or na hokar swayan 'shiv patni' nanda hai
 This pond represents his memory
 is sambandh main puranic katha kahi jaati he
