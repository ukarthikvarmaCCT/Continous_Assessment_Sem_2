 Other: Buddhism 03 janvari 1868 se lekar 3 may 1947 tak japan ek vishwashakti tha, jise japani samrajya kaha jaataa he
 Japan rapidly industrialized and militarized, working under the slogan 'make the country rich, make the army powerful', and it emerged as a world power
 aage chalakar vah 'aksh gathjod' kaa sadsy bana or asia-prashanth kshetra ke bahut bade bhaag kaa vijeta ban gaya
 When the Japanese Empire was at its peak in 1942, it had an area of 7,400,000 square kilometers under it, making it the largest maritime empire in history
 meiji punarsthaapan unnisvi shatabdi main japan main ek ghatnakram tha jis se san 1868 main samraat kaa shashan phir se behaal hua
 This led to very significant changes in the political and social environment of Japan, which led to rapid economic, industrial and military development
 is kranti ne japan ke edo kaal kaa ant kiya or meiji kaal ko armbh kiya
 Prior to this restoration, the Emperor of Japan was the only ruler of the name and in fact ruled the military dictator with the title of Shogun
 unnisvin shatabdi ke antim charan main japan kaa utkarsh evam europeakaran asia tathaa naveen samrajyavad ke itihaas main ek ugantarkari ghatana mana jayega
 The Meiji Restoration created a new awakening in the country and there was a wave of westernization and reforms in Japan
 kuch hi varshaan main japan dekhte-dekhte ek atyaadhunik raashtra ban gaya
 Now it could be fried from any advanced European state
 japan ne shuru main apana aadhunikeekaran aatmaraksha ke uddeshy se kiya tha
 It was a result of that experience that until Japan had made itself equivalent to the European states, the other countries of the Paris would not let it rest and end its independence
 lekin, unnisvi sadi ke ant main japan kaa vah uddeshy samaapt ho gaya
 Now there is a desire in Japan to follow the western world in every region

 The most important aspect of Japan's modernization was its unprecedented industrial development
 japan main bade-bade kal-kaarkaane khule or bahut bade paimaane par vastuon kaa utpaadan prarambh hua
 In this way, Japan was industrialized and became an industrialized country
 aadhunik udyogikaran samrajyavad kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn prarek tv rahaa he
 An industrialized country needs many things
 udyog dhandhe chalaane ke liye sarvapratham kachche maal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Then, the market is also required to produce goods from raw materials and sell them
 japan ek chota sa desh he or uske audyogic saadhan atyant simit hai
 For his business ventures he could not be satisfied with the raw materials received in his own country; Because that was very inadequate
 kachche maal ke liye vah duusare dashon par ashrith tha
 The same was with the market for selling industrial items
 jab utpaadan bade paimaane par hone laga to chizon ke khapat kii samasya ai
 Japan had to depend on other countries for both these things
 kachche maal or bazaar kii uplabdhi ke liye samrajyavaadee jivan kaa prarambh aavashyak ho gaya
 Both these things can only be achieved by exerting political sovereignty over the obcs
 koi bhi desh chaahe kitni bhi pichhadaa kyon na ho, is tarah swechhapurvak apana aarthik shoshan nahin hone degaa
 In such a situation it became necessary to establish political dominance over the backward countries to make them their market and to increase their business by the raw materials there
 raajnneetik prabhutv sthapit karne kaa ek upaay tha - yuddh
 Therefore, under this circumstance, Japan had to resort to war and thus began its imperialist life

 After the Meiji Restoration, Japan moved rapidly towards modernity
 is aadhuniktaa ko lahar main japan ke sainik punargathan par vishesh dhyaan diya gaya
 Prior to this, the military organization of Japan was based on the feudal system
 lekin, meiji punahsthapana ke uparaant japan ke sainik sanghathan main amul parivartan hua
 The feudalistic form of the army was given an end
 jab japan main anivaary sainik seva lagu kii gai or ek rashtriya sena kaa sanghathan hua
 To train this army, military experts were called from Prasha, who organized the Japanese Navy and the Army in a modern Prussian manner
 sena ko niyamit rup se vetan milane laga or sainikon par prasian anushaasan kaayam hua
 The people of Japan were of a military attitude from the beginning
 nae yug main unki is pravriti ko or protsaahan mila
 In the newly organized army, some very ambitious people were in the rank of officers
 ve aakraamak japan ko ugr or aakraamak sainik videsh niti kaa avlamban karnaa chahie
 He had great faith in the military power of Japan and on his strength he wanted to expand the kingdom of Japan
 unka vishwaas tha ki japan kii sainik shakti ajey he or uske bal par apana rajya vistaar kar sakate hai
 This powerful group of military officers had a big influence on the country's politics
 in logon ne japan kii sarkaar ko ugr aakraamak niti kaa anusaran karne ke liye baadhya kiya
 Japan's invasion of neighboring countries began with this

 Towards the end of the nineteenth century, European imperialism had developed into an extreme development in Asia and Africa
 us samay europe ke vividh rajya or sanyukt rajya america donon hi japan ke aasapaas ke kshetron main apane samrajya kaa vistaar kar chuke the athwa karne main vyast the
 The plundering and plundering of China had begun
 atev, apni suraksha ke liye yah aavashyak ho gaya ki japan bhi ugr aakraamak niti kaa avlamban kare
 The Japanese considered themselves to be superior species
 ve apane desh ko devloak tathaa apane samrat ko ishwar kaa rup maanate the
 He believed that the people of the rest of the world are wild and uncultivated and being the superior species, they have the right to rule other castes
 japan purv ke deshon main pehla desh tha jo europe ke kisi bhi desh kii barabari kar saktaa tha
 Therefore, on the strength of its military power, Japan started trying to enter European society
 meiji samvidhan ke anusaar japan main july, 1890 main pehla chunaav hua or sansad kaa sanghathan hua
 But, as soon as the Parliament meeting began that the Government started their clamor, the Parliamentarians demanded amendment in the Constitution so that the Government was responsible to the Parliament
 is baat kaa gatirodh utpann ho gaya
 Prime Minister Matsukata Masayasi was a staunch opponent of this proposal
 atev, 1891 i
 main usne sansad ko bhang kar diya or duusare chunaav kaa aadesh diya
 This turbulent internal political led the Japanese politicians to consider that if Japan were to follow an aggressive policy, there might be some improvement in the country's political and divert people's attention away from domestic events abroad
 atev japani adhikariyon ne ugr evam aakraamak niti kaa avlamban karne kaa nishchay kiya
 The country also had an aggressive foreign policy at the core of the emergence of Japanese imperialism

 Ramu agrees and goes to live with them
 mohan kaa dil tut jaataa he
 Then Sharma ji dies and Ramu does not have the money to pay the examination fee
 mohan ko jab yah baat pataa chalati he to beemaari main bhi vah gaakar paise juta letaa he or chupake se raamu ke skool main jamaa kar detaa he
 Mohan falls so ill that he has to go to the hospital where Meena starts taking care of him without telling him

 unki anek rachanaaon kaa angrezi anuwaad bhi ho chukaa he
 Ghananand appears to be the most literary writer among the major actors of the medieval wayward stream of Hindi
 inaki rachana ke do prakaar hai : ek main premsamvednaa k abhivyakti he, or duusare main bhakthisamvednaa kii vyakti
 Their composition is less in the eloquent form of the Abhidha, more in the satire form of the goal and symptom of the symptom

 He becomes frantic after seeing his heroine in a black sari
 saawanri sari ne sujan ke gore sareer ko kitna kantimaan bana diya hai
 a major feature of Ghanananda's poetry is the natural curvature of expression corresponding to sentiment
 ghanaanand kaa prem loukik prem kii bhav bhoomi se upar uthakar alokik prem kii bulandiyon ko chhutaa hua najar aata he, tab kavi kii priyasujan hi parabrahm kaa rup ban jaati he
 In such a situation, Ghanananda rises above love and becomes a devotee

 The prevailing statement regarding Kabir's Guru is that Kabir was looking for a suitable Guru
 vah vaishnav sant acharya ramanand ko apana apana guru bananaa chaahate the lekin unhone kabir ko shishy banane se manaa kar diya lekin kabir ne apane man main thaan liya ki swami ramanand ko hi har keemat par apana guru banaaungaa ,iske liye kabir ke man main ek vichaar aayaa ki swami ramanand ji subah chaar baje ganga snaan karne jate hai uske pehle hi unke jane ke maarg main sidhiyon let jaaounga or unhone aisa hi kiya
 One day, Kabir fell on the stairs of the Panchganga Ghat as soon as one night
 ramanand ji gangasnan karne ke liye seedhiyaan utar rahe the ki tabhi unka pair kabir ke sharir par pad gaya
 The word 'ram-ram' immediately came out of his mouth
 usee ram ko kabir ne diksha-mantra maan liya or ramanand ji ko apana guru sweekaar kar liya
 In Kabir's own words- jivicoparjan ke liye kabir julahe kaa kaam karte the
 Kabir had a strong belief that one gets his end in accordance with his deeds and not because of particular place
 apni is manyata ko siddh karne ke liye ant samay main vah magahar chale gaye ;kyonki logon manyata thi ki kaashi main marane par swarg or magahar main marane par narak miltaa he
 He breathed his last in Maghar

 The language of Kabir is Sadhukkari

 And sometimes "what happened if i grew up" us samay hindu janata par muslim aatank kaa kahar chaaya hua tha

 Kabir's Ram is not even a monotheistic, monotheistic God of Islam
 islam main khuda yaa allaah ko samast jagat evam jeevon se bhinn evam param samarth mana jaataa he
 But Ram of Kabir may be supremely capable, but he is never different from all beings and the world
 balki iske vipareet ve to sabamein vyaapt rahane vaale ramata ram hai
 He says that the universal Brahman Sabnimayi I, will worship the Pandit
 ravan-raav kawnasuun kavan veda ko rogi
 Kabir does not imagine any special design of Rama, because Rama would be bound in a particular structure as soon as he imagined the design, which was not acceptable to Kabir under any circumstances
 kabir ram kii avadharana ko ek bhinn or vyapak swaroop dena chaahate the
 There were some specific reasons for this, which we will discuss further in this article
 kintu iske baavjood kabir ram ke saath ek vyaktigat paariwarik kism kaa sambandh jarur sthapit karte hai
 His love for Rama is distinguished by his supernatural and glorious power without forgetting even a single moment on the surface of a spontaneous romantic human relationship
 kabir naam main vishwaas rakhte hai, rup main nahin
 Although it is commonly distinguished in the principles of devotion-sensation that 'the name is greater than the form', Kabir made this general principle a revolutionary use
 kabir ne ram-naam ke saath lokmanas main shatabdiyon se rache-based sanshlisht bhaavon ko udaatt evam vyapak swaroop dekar use puraana-pratipaadit brahmanvaadi vichaardhaara ke khaanche main baandhe jane se rokane kii koshish kii
 Kabir's Ram is beyond the distinction of nirgun-saguna
 darasal unhone apane ram ko shaastra-pratipaadit avtari, sagun, varchaswashil varnashram vyavastha ke sangrakshak ram se alag karne ke liye hi ‘nirgun ram’ shabd kaa prayog kiya–‘nirgun ram japahu re bhai
 There is no need to get confused about this 'nirguna' word
 kabir kaa aashay is shabd se sirf itnaa he ki ishwar ko kisi naam, rup, gun, kaal aadi kii simaaon main bandha nahin ja saktaa
 Those who are beyond all limits and still everywhere, are Nirgun Rama of Kabir
 ise unhone ‘ramata ram’ naam diya he
 Despite giving his Nirguna adjective to Rama, Kabir talks of a kind of human love affair with him
 kabhi vah ram ko maadhurya bhav se apana premi yaa pati maan lete hai to kabhi daasya bhav se swami
 Sometimes he considers Rama as the mother of Vatsalya idol and himself as his son
 nirgun-niraakaar brahm ke saath bhi is tarah kaa saras, sahaj, maanviya prem kabir kii bhakthi kii vilakshantaa he
 This dilemma and problem may occur to others that how Ram, with whom Kabir is so unique, human relational, can be good, but it is not a problem for Kabir himself
 vah kehete bhi hai “santau, dhokhaa kaasuun kahiye
 Gunam i nirgun, nirgunam gun, baat chaandi kya bahis! profesar mahavir saran jain ne kabir ke ram evam kabir kii sadhana ke sambandh main apane vichaar vyakt karte hue kaha he : " kabir kaa sara jivan satya kii khoj tathaa asaty ke khandan main vyateet hua
 Kabir's cultivation begins by knowing "not obeying"
 ve kisi ke shishy nahin, ramanand dwaara chetaye hue chela hai
 For him, Rama is not a form, Dasharathi is not Rama, his Rama is a symbol of spiritual practice
 unke ram kisi sampradaay, jati yaa desh kii simaaon main kaid nahin he
 In the particle of nature, even in Ramana in the limb, which one cannot touch, he is Alakh, the imperishable, the supreme element Rama
 unke ram manushya or manushya ke bich kisi bhed-bhav ke kaarak nahin hai
 They are the symbols of the element of love
 bhav se upar uthakar mahabhaav yaa prem ke aradhy hai - 'prem jagavai virah ko, virah jagavai piu, piu jagavai jeeva, joi piu soi jiu' - the one who is piu is the same creature
 isi kaaran unki puri sadhana ‘‘hans ubaaran aae kii sadhana he
 This goose cannot be revived by the reading of Pothis, and two and a half can be done only by the conduct of love
 dharm odhane kii cheez nahin he, jivan main aacharan karne kii satat satya sadhana he
 His practice begins with love
 itnaa gaharaa prem karo ki vahi tumhaare liye paramatma ho jaae
 There is so much eagerness to get it that one becomes the most reclusive, disrespectful, only then can that meditation be awakened in meditation
 vahi piu tumhaare arntman main baithe jeev ko jagaa saktaa he
 Joi Peiu is Soi Jiu
 tab tum puure sansar se prem karoge, tab sansar kaa prayek jeev tumhaare prem kaa paatr ban jayega
 All arrogance, all malice will go away
 phir mahabhaav jagega
 With this great spirit, the whole world becomes Piu's home

 ise kelvin ikai kaa prayog karke vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Ultimate zero is the minimum temperature that can be attained
 isse kam taap hona sambhav hi nahin he
 Since the temperature of a solid exhibits the magnitude of the vibrations of its atoms, atoms at absolute zero temperature stop vibrating completely
 shuddhi When you measure something, the accuracy is how close your measured value is to the real value
 For example, if you're actually six feet tall and your brother measures your height as six feet, one inch, he's pretty accurate
 However, if your cousin measures your height as twelve feet, 13 inches, he's not accurate at all
 This is anything that gives off h + ions in water
 Acids have a ph less than 7 and are good at dissolving metals
 They turn litmus paper red and phenolphthalein colorless
 acid anhydride This is an oxide that forms an acid when you stick it in water
 An example is SO3 - when you add water it turns into sulfuric acid, H2SO4
 acid dissociation constant This is equal to the ratio of the concentrations of an acid's conjugate base and the acid present when a weak acid dissociates in water
 That is, if you have a solution of Acid x where the concentration of the conjugate base is 0
5 m and the concentration of the acid is 10 M, the acid dissociation constant is 0
5 / 10 = 0
05
 activated complex In a chemical reaction, the reagents have to join together into a great big blob before they can fall back apart into the products

 Flammability, on the other hand, is a chemical property, because you can't tell if something burns unless you actually try to burn it
 chirality When a molecule has a nonsuperimposable mirror image
 To imagine this, put your hands together
 Although they are mirror images, you can't put them right on top of each other so they are interchangable
 Well, normal people can't, anyway

 degenerate Things are said to be degenerate if they have the same energy
 This term is used a whole lot in quantum mechanics
 Also when dealing with kids who steal cars
 delocalization This is when electrons can move around all over a molecule
 This happens when you have double bonds on adjacent atoms in a molecule denature when the 3-D structure of a protein breaks down due to heat, it's said to be denatured
 This means that it unravels because the intermolecular forces between atoms in the chain aren't strong enough to hold it together anymore
 visaran When particles move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration
 For example, if you open a bottle of ammonia on one end of the room, the concentration of ammonia molecules in the air is very high on that side of the room
 As a result, they tend to migrate across the room, which explains why you can smell it after a little while
 Be careful not to mix this up with effusion Dilution when you add solvent to a solution to make it less concentrated

 enthalpy a measurement of the energy content of a system
 entropy a measurement of the randomness in a system
 enzyme a biological molecule that catalyzes reactions in living creatures

 This area is still known as Pir Abdul Aziz in Pakistan
 aazaadee kii ladaai main inhone sabase pehle muslim lig or uske baad anya logon ke saath judakar bad-chadhakar bhaag liya
 At that time there used to be only two parties in the form of Congress and Muslim League
 1925 main mohammad sabir ne aazaadee ke liye angrejon ke khilaaf ek andolan ko dekha to wo bhi aazaadee kii ladaai main shaamil ho gaye
 After his release from jail, Khan Siddiqui stayed in Mumbai for a few days and then moved to Indore
 24, gafoor khan kii bajariya or ranipura main vah saalon tak lakdi kaa bijness karte rahe
 He also participated in agitations against the government several times for the problems of Indore after independence
 unhone jite ji kabhi bhi sarkaar se sidhe koi madad nahin maangi
 He said that those who are being given to everyone should also meet on their own
 inhen aazaadee ke baad main khan siddiqui al hindi ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 The state government also gave pension considering them as freedom fighters
 teen agast 1990 ko khan siddiqui kaa intkaal hone gaya
 Khan considered Siddiqui Mohammad Ali Jinnah as the biggest impediment to independence
 unka maananaa tha ki kaayade ajam jinna hindustan kii aazaadee ke raste main rukaawat ke saath-saath angreji samrajya ke haath main ek khilonaa he
 He believed that freedom was most needed at that time, whereas Jinnah was engaged in the exercise of dividing the country into two pieces along with independence
 unhone 26july 1943 ko mumbai main tatkaaleen muslim lig ke pramukh mohammad ali jinna par chaaku se hamalaa kar diya
 This attack was made by entering his house
 is hamale kaa makasad jinna ko maarna tha
 25-year-old Sabir came to Mumbai from Lahore for the attack
 hamale main jinna kii gardan, baae kandhe, thodi or kalai main kaaphi chot ai
 Jinnah's companions protected Jinnah by capturing Mohammad Sabir
 mumbai main hij lard ship kii adaalat main unke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaaya gaya
 In the court too, he called Jinnah a hindrance to independence
 gavaahon ke bayaan ke baad khan siddiqui ko maut kii sajaa dene kii maang kii gai
 The court sentenced him to five years of imprisonment under Section 3 of 7
 unhen pehle 4 navambar 1943 se yarvada central jail main rakhaa gaya
 He was then shifted to Arthur Road Central Jail Mumbai on 12-4-1945
 baad main unhen reeha kiya gaya
 In Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Jinnah has been given the status of Janak and quaid-e-azam, so Khan Siddiqui is considered a big terrorist in the history of Pakistan

 No one can be punished for an offense if he has not directly or indirectly done any work which is invalid by law or has not committed error in any mandatory work prescribed by law
 saadhaarant: kisi aparaadh kii purnataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vah 'doshapurn man' yaa 'aapraadhik manahosthiti' se kiya jaay
 But only if the offender is voluntary can his work be considered a crime
 swechha se kiya hua kaam yaa kaam kii avhelnaa vah he, jise karne yaa na karne kii ichha rahi ho
 Therefore, if a person has committed a crime in an unconscious state - that is, when sleepy, from a very low state, due to inertia or insanity - then it would be presumed that his brain was not functioning in such a situation
 falat: us kaam ke karne yaa uski avhelnaa main uski ichha nahin thi
 Similarly, if a person commits a crime on being extremely bound, then there will be a lack of voluntary work in it
 koi kaam yaa isamen chyuti ichhapurna maani jaayegi, yadi kaaryakari upyukt saavdhaanee baratane par use nahin karata yaa uski avhelnaa se virat hota
 Do not consider any involuntary work or error of work voluntary
 at: yadi yah pramanit ho ki upyukt saavdhaanee baratane par bhi aisa kaam nahin ruk sakaa to yah dandaneey nahin ho saktaa
 Sometimes the desire to do something forbidden by law is considered to be a defective mind

 For illustration, if a person marries another with his wife, he cannot say in his defense that he believed with a pure heart that his first marriage has been severed
 is varg main kanoon dwaara nirdisht chote chote aparaadh hi aate hai
 In order to know whether a defective mind is necessary in such crimes, it becomes necessary to look towards the objective of the specified law
 jis aparaadh main vishesh ichha yaa maansik sthiti aavashyak he, uske liye koi vyakti apradhi nahin hoga, yadi uskaa man doshapurn nahin tha evam duusare vyakti ke aadesh se usne vah aparaadh kiya tha
 But the person whose order caused the crime, will be liable
 saadhaarant: koi vyakti kisi kaam yaa uski avhelnaa ke liye uttaradaayi nahin hoga, yadi usne swayan aparaadh nahin kiya he yaa nirdhaarit kaam karne se virat nahin hua he yaa kisi duusare vyakti ko aparaadh karne ke liye adhikaar nahin diya he or na use nirdhaarit kaam karne se virat hone kii prerana di he
 No owner can be punished for the malice, fraud or neglect of his servant or agent, because the mental state of the servant or agent cannot be called the mental state of the owner
 kintu simit varg ke kuch maamalon main jahaan maansik sthiti aparaadh ke liye aavashyak nahin he, apane sevak yaa agent ke saamaanya kaary ke dauraan main kiye gaye kaamon ke liye maalik uttaradaayi hoga, bhale hi use aise kaam kii jaankaree na rahi ho or ve kaam uske aadesh ke viruddh hi kyon na kiye gaye hon
 a corporation can work only through its servant or agent
 at: inke kaam yaa kanoon dwaara nirdisht kaam main truti ke kaaran nigam hi uttaradaayi ho saktaa he
 But the corporation shall not be liable for treason, gurudra crime, and minor offenses, which may be punished personally by violence or for crimes in which imprisonment or physical torture can be punished
 apane sevak yaa agent ke aparaadh ke liye use keval arthdand diya ja saktaa he

 shamsher ek tarah kii talwaar he jiskaa vakr vishisht hoti he Part of a category on Sikhism guru hargobind sikhon ke chhathen guru the
 Sahib has been praised in the Sikh history of Guru Arjun Dev Ji's son, Guru Hargobind Sahib, as a dal-bhanjan warrior
 guru hargobind sahib kii shiksha diksha mahaan vidvan bhai gurdas kii dekh-rekh main hui
 Guru ji was equally blessed with Baba Budaji
 chathe guru ne sikh dharm, samskruti evam isaki aachaar-samhita main anek aise parivartanon ko apni ankhon se dekha jinke kaaran sikhi kaa mahaan bootaa apni jade majboot kar rahaa tha
 Guru Hargobind Sahib gave protection to this great plant of heritage with his divine vision and gave it an opportunity to flourish
 apane pita shri guru arjuna dev kii shahidi ke adarsh ko unhone na keval apane jivan kaa uddeshy mana, balki unke dwaara jo mahaan kaary prarambh kiye gaye the, unhen safalataa purvak sampoorn karne ke liye aaajeevan apni patibaddhta bhi dikhalaai
 According to the changing circumstances, Guru Hargobindsaheb also took up the education of arms and scripture

 He had a wonderful practice of wielding a variety of weapons
 guru hargobindsahib kaa chintan bhi krantikari tha
 He wanted the Sikh community to be empowered to fight atrocities and oppression along with peace, devotion and religion

 Guru - He assumed the two swords of Miri and Piri as soon as he assumed the throne
 miri or piri kii donon talavaarein unhen baba boddaji pahanaai
 It is from here that Sikh history takes a new mode
 guru hargobindsahib miri-piri ke sankalp ke saath sikh-darshan kii chetana ko nae aadhyatm darshan ke saath jod dete hai
 In this process politics and religion became complementary to each other

 jahangir ne keval guru ji ko hi gwalior ke kile se aaazaad nahin kiya, balki unhen yah swatantrata bhi di ki ve 52raajaaon ko bhi apane saath lekar ja sakate hai
 That is why in Sikh history, Guru Ji is called a prisoner and a donor

 Akal Takht Sahib emerged as the supreme institution for the Sikh society, which concentrated Sikh power in the future and gave it a distinct social and historical identity
 iskaa shrey guru hargobindsahib ko hi jaataa he
 Guru Hargobindsaheb Ji was a very philanthropic warrior
 unka jivan darshan jan-saadhaaran ke kalyaan se juda hua tha

 shri guru granth sahib ke mahaan sandesh ne guru-parampara ke un kaaryo ko bhi prakaashmaan banaaya jiske kaaran bhavishya main maanavtaa kaa maha kalyaan hone ja rahaa tha
 Due to these untiring efforts of Guru Ji, the Sikh tradition was also taking a new form and redefining the dignity of its heritage in new contexts
 guru hargobindsahib kii chintan kii disha ko nae vyaavhaarik arth de rahe the
 In fact it was the effect of his aura and power

 Guru Hargobindsaheb used all his strength to establish the ideals of Harmandirsahib and Akal Takht Sahib
 guru hargobindsahib praaia: punjab se baahar bhi sikh dharm ke prachaar hetu apane shishyon ko bheja karte the
 Guru Hargobindsaheb not only linked Sikh life philosophy to contemporary problems, but also created a life vision that also highlighted the possibility of glorious solutions
 sikh lahar ko prabhaavshaalee banane main guru ji kaa adwitiya yogadan rahaa
 Guru Ji included Jyoti-plots in Kiratpur Sahib

 He had made a big chola for Guru Nanak Dev Ji, which had 52 cloves, he had made this cloth a little bigger after hearing about him that his body is a little heavier
 mata kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue guru sahib ne ye chola unase lekar pahan liya
 When Guru Sahib was freed from the fort of Gwalior, he wore this same chola, whose 52 kings, holding 52 buds, came out one by one in the prison of the fort, since then Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji called "donor Bandi Chod"

 andromeda taramandal niharika ke samaan taramandal he jo prithvi se 2,500,000 prakaash varsh dur andromeda nakshatra-mandal main sthit he
 It is called Messier 31, M31 or NGC 224 and is often referred to in texts as the great Andromeda Niharika
 andromeda sarpilaakaar tara punj, hamaari sabase nikatatam akashganga he lekin kul milakar yah sabase nikatatam taramandal nahin he
 It can be seen as a stain on the moonless night, it can be seen by objects far away from the naked eye, and can also be seen in urban areas with binoculars
 iske naam ko us akaash kshetra se liya gaya he jahaan yah prakat hota he, andromeda nakshatramandal or jiskaa naam puranic rajkumaari andromeda ke naam par rakhaa gaya he
 Andromeda is the largest galaxy in the local group consisting of Andromeda galaxy, Milky Way galaxy, Triangulum galaxy and 30 other minor galaxies
 haalanki, sabase bada andromeda bahut vishalkay nahin he, kyonki haal hi khojon se pataa chalaa he ki akashganga main bahut se chupe maamle hai or jinke usase bhi vishalkay swaroop ho sakate hai
 Viewed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope, it has been found that M31 contains billions of stars, many more than our planetary planets whose number is about c
 200-400 billion
 
 While in 2006, the galaxy's planets were estimated at ~ 80% compared to Andromeda, which is roughly equivalent to 7
1 × 1011 solar planets, a 2009 study showed that the density of Andromeda and the Akash Ganga is roughly the same

 The Roman poet Avinus wrote in his fascinating line about the series constellation in the fourth century BCE

 In other star paintings of the time it was inscribed as Little Cloud
 doorabeen dwaara avlokan kiye jane ke aadhaar par is grah kaa pehla vivaran german khagolvid simon marius dwaara 1612 main kiya gaya
 Charles Messier listed it as the M31 planet in 1764 and was erroneously credited as an explorer to Marius, who was unaware of Sufi al's earlier work
 1785 main, khagolvid wiliam harshal ne M31 ke pramukh kshetra main dhundhlee laal rang varna kaa ullekh kiya
 He believed that it was closest to the "great Nebula" and based on the color and size of the nebula, he miscalculated that it was no more than 2000 times larger than Sirius' distance
 1864 main wiliam hagins ne M31 ke varnakram kaa avlokan kiya or yah paaya ki yah gasiy nebula se bhinn he
 The spectra of M31 form deep absorption lines exhibiting a continuum of frequencies as layers that help identify a chemical mixture of a substance
 andromeda nebula bahut adhik alag taron ke spectra ke samaan tha jisase isaki utpatti hui jisamen M31 kii taarakeey prakruti thi
 In 1885, the supernova was first seen in the M31, which was seen only once in this galaxy
 us samay M31 ko sabase nazadiiki grah mana gaya tha, isliye vastu paas tha ek vichaar karne ke liye he, isliye is kalpana ko bahut adhik lokapriyata nahin mil saki or is asambaddha ghatana ko nova kaha gaya or iskaa naam "nova 1885" ke anusaar rakhaa gaya
 The first photograph of the M31 was taken by Isaac Robert in 1857 at his private observatory, Sussex, England
 lambii avadhi ke khulaase ke baad tarapunj kii sarpilaakaar sanrachana ko pehali baar dekha gaya
 However, at that time it was generally considered to be a nebula in our galaxy and Robert mistakenly thought that the M31 and similar spiral nebula were in fact the form of the structure of the solar system that was taken with the help of satellite Nessant planets
 hamaari saura pranali ke sambandh main is grah ke trigyakaar veg ko 1912 main vesto slifer dwaara lowell vedhashala main, spectroscopy kaa upyog karke mapa gaya tha
 As a result, at that time, its velocity was recorded very fast in the direction of the sun at 300 kilometres per second
 1917 main, america khagol vigyaani heber curtis ne M31 main nova ko dekha
 photo record khojate hue, unhone 11 or novon kii khoj kii
 Curtis observed that the average size of those novices was 10 times the size of the novices in Tarapunja
 jiske parinamswaroop use anumaanit 500,000 prakaash varsh duuri se dekha ja saktaa tha
 So he became the proponent of the so-called "island universe", the spiral nebula that was actually an independent galaxy
 1920 main, harley shorpale or curtis ke bich akaash ganga, sarpilaakaar nebula or brahmad ke aayam se sambandhit mahaan bahes aarambh ho gai
 In support of the claim that the great Andromeda Nebula was externally tarapunz, Curtis observed the texture of dark lines resembling foggy clouds in our tarapunj and observed a characteristic doppler shift
 1922 main, arnest opic ne M31 kii duuri ke akalan kaa ek bahut hi sundar or saral khagoleey vidhi prastut kii
 He placed our Tarapanja at about 450 KPC from Andromeda, which is about 1500 KLY
 edwin hoobal ne is bahes kaa aarambh 1925 main kiya jab unhone pehali baar M31 ke khagol chitra ke liye akaash ganga ke pare vibhinn cefeid taron kii pahchaan kii
 These were taken using the 2
5 m Hooker Telescope and enabled them to determine the distance to the great Andromeda Nebula
 jiske parinamswaroop uski maap kaa pradarshan kiya gaya ki uski visheshta hamaari akashganga main taron or gas kaa punj nahin thi, lekin vah hamaari akashganga se puri tarah se alag vishesh duuri par sthit thi
 Andromeda played an important role in the study of galaxies, as it is the closest spiral galaxy
 1943 main, walter bade andromeda akashganga ke kendriya kshetra main taron kaa samaadhaan nikaalane vaala pehla vyakti tha
 Based on observations of this galaxy, based on his observations about it, he was able to identify two stars based on their metallicity, namely the high-velocity stars in the Young Disc Type i and the Type II reds emerging in the Old Age
 Stars
 is naam ko akashganga main taron yaa kisi anya sthaan se apanaae gaye
 Dr
 Bade also discovered that there are two types of galaxies which are twice the size of M31 and other stars of the universe
 andromeda akashganga radio utsarjan kaa pataa radio khagol vigyaan pramukhgrote rebar dwaara 1940 main lagaaya gaya tha
 The first radio map of the galaxy was created by Johann Baldwin in 1950 in collaboration with Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group
 andromeda akashganga kaa mul bhaag ko 2C radio khagol vigyaan pustika-suchi main 2C 56 kehalaata he
 In 2009, the first planet was discovered in the Andromeda galaxy
 is grah kaa pataa ek takanic kaa prayog karke lagaaya gaya jo microlencing kehalaata he, jo vishalkay grahon ke prakaashiya pratibimb ke kaaran utpann hota he
 The measured distance to the Andromeda galaxy was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered to be the second slowest type of galaxy
 1990 ke dashak main, donon maanak laal vishalkay evam laal punj taare hipparcos satellite kii maap main mandakaniyon kii dooriyaan maapne ke liye upyog kiye gaye the
 At least four different techniques were used to measure the distance to the Andromeda galaxy

 In 2005, astronomers used the Keck Telescope to show that the shimmer of stars moves outside the galaxy, which is actually a part of the main disk
 iskaa matlab he ki andromeda main taron kii sarpilaakaar discs pichley anumaan kii tulana main teen guna adhik badi he
 Continuous evidence suggests that it has a massive stellar disk that increases the diameter of the galaxy by more than 220,000 light years
 isse pehle, andromeda ke aakaar kaa anumaan lagbhag 70,000 se 120,000 prakaash varsh ke asapas tha
 The Milky Way is tilted about 77 ° to one side of the Earth
 Analysis of the galaxy's oblique cut shape reveals a much clearer, S-shaped tilt than the flat disk
 is tarah ke jhukaav ke sambhavit kaaran M31 ke paas upgrah akashganga gurutvkarshan ho saktaa he
 Some inclination is possible due to M31 in the galaxy M33, although it depends on its exact distance and radius velocities
 spectroscopy adhyayan ke antarvaaag main M31 ke vibhinn ghurnan veg vaali maap kii vyakhya kii gai he
 Close to its core, various 1,300 light-years have been observed at a radius of light-year with a high rotational velocity of 225 kilometres per second and then a minimum drop of 7,000 light-years with a rotational velocity of up to 50 kilometres per second
 
 uske baad uske veg main nirantar 33,000 prakaash varsh trigya tak kii vruddhi hoti jaati he, jo shirshatam 250 kilometres per second tak pahunch jaati he
 As the distance increases, its velocity declines, with a possible fall of 200 kilometres per second to 80,000 light years

 In 1998, the European Space Observatory could display images of the European Space Agency infrared space observatory images in transit to the annular galaxy
 andromeda main gas or dhul kai valyakaar swaroop banate hai, jo vishesh rup se iske moolbhag se 32,000 prakaash varsh trigya ke saath valay ke rup main banate hai
 This ring is hidden from the visible light images of the galaxy as it is composed mainly of dust made of cold dust
 andromeda ke bhitari kshetra kii pareekshan karne par uske valay main chote kanon ke hone kaa pataa laga he or aisa samajha jaataa he ki yah 20 karod saal pehle M32 ke sampark main aane ke parinamswaroop hua hoga
 Following this, it is found that the small galaxy passed along Andromeda's disk along the polar axis of the latter
 Its collision caused more than half of the smaller M32's bodies to break apart and create a ring ring in Andromeda
 M31 ke bade hue prabhamandal ke adhyayan se pataa laga ki isaki tulana akashganga ke saath karnaa sambhav nahin kyonki taron ke prabhamandal main aamtaur par "aparyaapt dhaatu" hoti hai jo duuri badhane ke saath-saath badhati chali jaati hai
 These evidences show that both galaxies follow the same evolutionary path

 In a larger telescope the visible effect of a star embodied in more extended magnification creates
 cendrak kii chamak adhik chamkile golakaar jhund kii adhikta he
 In 1991, Todd R
 Lear used the WFPC and was later set up to take images of the inner nucleus of Andromeda to the Hubel space telescope
 cendrak main do sanyojaktaayen hai jo 1
5 parsek dwaara alag kii jaati hai
 The luminous valence is designed in P1, equivalent to the galaxy center
 P2 kii dhundhlee sanyojaktaa akashganga ke centre main sthit he or 3-5x107m☉ blike hole sthit he
 Scott Tramanne suggested that the interpretation of the observed double nucleus is possible if the P1 central black hole had a projection of the image of the star in the focal chamber around the stars
 uski utkendratha is prakaar kii he ki taare kakshiya apocenter se jude rahete hai jinke kaaran taron kii abhimukhataa main vruddhi hoti he
 P2 has a dense disc of hot spectral class a stars

 Whereas, at the time of its initial discovery, it was hypothesized that the luminosity of the double nucleus was the remaining part of the small galaxy "cannibalized" near Andromenda, after which there was no clear explanation
 iskaa mul kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke cendrak kaa kendriya blike hole dwaara utaar-chadhaav vaale vyavdhaan ke kaaran jeevankaal atyadhik chota ho jaataa he
 While partially resolving it is possible if P1 has its own stabilizing black hole, the upheaval in P1 does not mean that it has a black hole at its center
 vishesh rup se, 1968 ke ant tak akashganga kaa koi eks-re nahin liya gaya tha
 On 20 October 1970, the upper limits of detectable hard X-rays from the M31 were set

 It has several million stars and has twice the brightness of Omega Centauri, known as the brightest spherical beam in the galaxy
 globular 1 main kai taarakeey sankhya bahut adhik he or saamaanya golakaar ke liye inaki sanrachana bahut adhik saghan hoti he
 As a result, some consider G1 to be a small part of a small galaxy that was considered M31 some time ago
 globular kii sabase adhik spasht chamak G76 ke samaan he jo uske purvi bhaag main dakshini-purvi bhaag main sthit he
 In 2005, astronomers discovered a completely different type of star mass in M31
 khoja gaya nayaa tara punj main karodo taare shaamil thim or inhen vartulakaar punjon main iske samaan sankhya main anya taare khoje ja sakate hai
 What makes them different from circular groups is that they are larger - several hundred light years larger - and many times less dense than them
 isliye, taron ke bich duuri haal hi main khoje gaye vistaarit punjon main kaaphi adhik he
 Similar to the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy consists of satellite galaxies numbered 14 smaller galaxies
 sabase acchhee jaankaree vaali or sabase adik dekhi jane vaali upgrah akashganga M32 or M110 hai
 Based on current evidence, it appears that the M32 has a very close encounter with the M31
 M32 kabhi bahut badi akashganga rahi hogi jiske baad M31 ne iske taarakeey bimb ko hataa diya or iske antarbhag main taare ke nirmaan main badi teji ke saath vruddhi hui jisaki samaapti uske baad ho gai
 The M110 may also have come into contact with M31, and astronomers discovered metal-rich stars in the M31's halo that appear as lines from these satellite galaxies
 M110 ke dhul nahin he jo haal kii or vartmaan taare kii banaavat kii taraf ingit karata he
 In 2006, it was discovered that nine of these galaxies are parallel, dividing the core of the Andromeda galaxy rather than arranging their independent interactions randomly
 This may indicate a normal tidal origin for satellites
 andromeda akashganga, akashganga kii taraf 100 se 140 kilometres per second teji se bad rahi hai, isliye yah sthanantarit hone vaali neeli akashganga main se ek he
 The Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way are expected to collide after perhaps 450 million years, although its description is uncertain because the relevant velocity of Andromeda can only be compared to the Milky Way based on one or two components
