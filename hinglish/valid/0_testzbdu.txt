 vidhik samajashaastra ) kaa adhyayan samajashaastra ke upakshetra ke rup main yaa vidhi ke adhyayan ke antargat hi ek antaravishayi kshetra ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The concept of sociological jurisprudence is relatively modern
 iskaa udbhav unnisvin sadi main hua jab maanav yah anubhav karne laga ki samaaj ke vikaas ke liye use saamaajik anushaasan main rahakar aapasi sahyog kaa maarg apnaanaa nitant aavashyak he
 Presently, more emphasis is being laid on the social side than on the individual side of man
 vidhi kaa saamaajik parivartanon se nikatatam sambandh hone k kaaran vah maanav ke is badale hue drushtikon se aprabhavit hue bina na rah sakaa
 As a result, a new method of jurisprudence emerged which developed in the name of sociological jurisprudence
 iske antargat vidhi ke saamaajik pahalu par adhik jor diya gaya he
 Sociological jurisprudence has also been called the 'jurisprudence of interests' because the main goal of every social system is to preserve and promote the interests of human beings
 vidhi ke prati is drushtikon kaa apnaane vaale vidhishastriyon kaa vichaar he ki maanav ke paraspar virdohi hiton main samanvay sthapit karnaa vidhishastra kaa pramukh kaary he
 German ideologist Rudolf Ihring developed this ideology more
 unke anusaar vidhi na to swatantra rup sa viksit hui he or na vah rajya kii manamaani dein hi he
 It is also not based on prudence but on expediency as its basic objective is to eliminate the conflict between conflicting interests of society and establish coordination and uniformity among them
 samajashastreey vidhishastra ke vidhishastriyon ke anusaar nyaayalayon ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vidhi ke amoort or lekhabaddh swaroop par vishesh jor na dekar usak vyaavhaarik pahalu par adhik bal den arthath ve un saamaajik aavashyaktaaon or uddeshyon kii jaanch karen jo sambandhit kanoon paarit hone ke liye karneebhoot hue hai
 Sociological jurisprudence has received strong support in the US
 prasiddh america vidhishastri dean rasko pound ne to vidhishastra ko ‘saamaajik abhiyantriki’ kii sangya di he
 According to this ideology, mainly two things are studied under jurisprudence- vidhishastra ke prati samajashastreey drushtikon apanaaye jane ke falswaroop america main yathartwaadee vichaardhaara kaa pradurbhaav hua jiske antargat vidhi ke kriyaatmak pahalu ko itnaa adhik mahatv diya gaya he ki isse samhitaon or adhiniyamon ke amoort niyamon tathaa unamem sannihit siddhanton kaa mahatv newnepraay ha gaya
 Adopting a purposive approach to law and jurisprudence, realists transformed the law from imaginary principles to a fact-based form of facts and thus considered the method to be a functional tool for solving social problems
 is vichaardhaara ke prabal samarthak jerome frank kaa maananaa tha ki vidhi kaa niyat rahanaa ek kaalpanik tathy he kyonki vidhi sadaiv hi parivartansheel hoti he or isiliye vidhi ke samhitakaran yaa purv-nirnyon ko vishesh mahatv nahin diya janaa chahie
 According to Frank, the development of law has a direct relation with social progress
 levillin ne vidhishastra ko saamaajik pragati kaa strot maanate hue uske kriyaatmak pahalu par bal diya gaya he
 According to him, it is the duty of the practitioner to study and analyze the law in the context of contemporary social problems
 vidhi ko saiddhanthik daayre se hatakar maanav jivan ke vyaavhaarik pahalu se samasyaon ke nivaaran main sahaayak hona chahie
 In the historical perspective, see the prevalent apartheid, slavery, satyapratha, untouchability, child marriages etc
 were abolished by law
 in saamaajik buraaiyon ko vidhi dwaara samaapt ghoshit karne ke pashchaat unhe prerit karne ko bhi dandic aparaadh ghashit kar diya gaya
 Thus the Hindu society got freedom from the practice of Sati
 isi prakaar, karnataka main sadiyaan puraani devdasi pratha samaapt samaapt karnaa isliye aavashyak mana gaya he kyonki yah vyavastha bhrsht ho gayi thi aar apane mul lakshya se bhatak gai thi
 Apart from this, many laws were developed to remove many kinds of social evils, so that there was continuous action in the law for social change and it became the mainstay of social change
 vidhi kaa naveen srijan hi samaaj ko us buraai se mukti dilaataa he or iske kaaran saamaajikparivartan hota he
 The great credit for the fame of the Pound goes to his social engineering
 ve vidhi ke kaaryo ko saamaajik abhiyantriki kehete hai
 Lound, considers the law not an abstract object but a social truth, an objective and one to overcome and reconcile conflicts / conflicts
 unke anusaar vidhi samaaj kaa hitvardhak, kalyankaarak tathaa vyaktiyon ke swaarthon ko kam karne vaala hota he
 If the method is not useful or functional, then it has no value for society
 samaaj ke liye kanoon ek esa saadhan he jiske dwaara shaanti, sukh, samruddhi aar vikaas aadi saamaajik uddeshyon kii prapti ho sakati he
 It has an invaluable contribution in the future development of the society
 nyaay prashasan main to vidhi kii ahm bhoomika hoti he, isaliye vidhi kaa nirmaan saamaajik paristhitiyon,, maang, iccha araavashyaktaaon ke aadhaar par kiya janaa chahie
 Pounds have described the method as helpful in this area, so that production can be consumed and distributed
 kanoon hameshaa samaaj kii pragati ke liye banaaye jate he, samaaj kii pragati ko raakane ke liye nahin
 Therefore, law is also expected to be progressive with society
 samaaj ke logon ke saamaanya hiton tathaa swaarth main samanvay na baitaane par vah ugr rup dhaaran karke samaaj kii shaanti vyavastha par pratikul prabhaav daal saktaa he
 This method only works
 isi ko pounds saamaajik abhiyantran naam dete he

 "malanishia" kaa naam unani bhashaa ke do shabdon ko jodne se aata he - "melas" yani "kaala" or "nisos" yani "dweep"
 Therefore, the name "malanisia" means "black Island", which is a gesture towards the black skin of the human beings living on these islands

 His friend Andrew Fuller first wrote an influential pamphlet titled "the Gospel Uniform of All Exceptions" in 1781 in which he wrote in response to the hyper-calvinist ideology prevalent in the Baptist churches at the time that all people had responsibility for believing in theology Is not there 1786 main hui mantriyon kii ek baithak main kairi ne yah sawaal uthaaya ki kya duniya bhar main dharmasiddhant kaa prasar karnaa sabhi isaiyon kaa kartavya he

 Carrie later preached a pro-missionary sermon, using Isaiah 54: 2-3 as her text in which she repeatedly used jokes which became her most famous quote: kairi ne ant main mishanri prayaas ke khilaaf kiye ja rahe pratirodh par kaabo paa liya or oktober 1792 main particular baptist socity for da propagation of da gospal amongst da hidan kii sthapana kii gai jiske charter sadasyon main kairi, andrew fuller, jon riland or jon satakliff shaamil the

 In April 1793, Carrie, her eldest son Felix, Thomas and his wife and daughter left London on an English ship
 Dorothy Carrie refused to leave England because her fourth son was in the womb and had never been more than a few miles away from home; But they once again asked her to walk with him before walking away, and she agreed to walk in on the fact that her sister Kitty would help her with her delivery

 unhone bangala or sanskrit ke vyakaran kaa bhi lekhan kiya or sanskrit main bible kaa anuwaad karnaa shuru kar diya
 After consulting with the pundits and seeing that they had no basis in Hindu sacred texts, they also used their influence over the governor-general to help curb infant sacrifice and sati
 1807 main dorothi kairi kii maut ho gai
 She had not been a useful member of the mission for a long time and in fact it was a hindrance in some way

 Ole Holsti states that the principles of international relations act as a pair of colored sunglasses, which allows the person wearing them to see only events relevant to the main principle
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main yatharthwaad, udaarvaad or rachnawad, teen sabase lokapriy siddhant hai
 Theories of international relations can be divided mainly into two theories, "positivist / rationalist" who focuses primarily on state-level analysis

 The distinction between interpretive and constructivist approaches in the theory of international relations is seen when we classify the principles of international relations
 vyaakhyaatmak siddhant ve hai jo siddhant nirmaan ke liye bahari duniya ko saidhantik drushti se dekhte hai
 Constructive theories are those that believe that theories actually help build the world
 yatharthwaad yaa raajnneetik yatharthwaad, antarrashtriya sambandhon ke shikshan kii shuruyaat ke baad se hi antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa pramukh siddhant rahaa he
 This theory claims to rely on ancient traditional approaches, including authors such as Thucydide, Machiavelli, and Hobbes
 praarambhik yatharthwaad ko adarshavaadi soch ke khilaaf ek pratikriya ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Realists saw the outbreak of World War II as a proof of their lack of idealistic thinking
 aadhunik yathartwaadee vichaaron main vibhinn kismein hai, haalanki, is siddhant ke mukhya siddhanton ke rup main rajya niyantran vaad, astitv or swayan sahaayta ko mana jaataa he
 Realism has many important beliefs
 yathartwaadee maanate hai ki raashtra - rajya is arajak antarrashtriya pranali main aikik va bhugolic aadhaarit abhinayta hai, jahaan koi bhi vaastavik aadhikarik vishwa sarkaar ke rup main maujuud nahin he jo in raashtra- rajyon ke bich antah kriya yaa sahabhaagitaaon ko viniyamit karne main sakasham ho
 Secondly, it considers sovereign states to be the primary actors in international affairs rather than intergovernmental organizations, international organizations, ngos, or multinationals
 is prakaar, rajya hi, sarvocch vyavastha ke rup main, ek duusare ke saath pratispardhaa main rahete hai
 As such, a state acts as a rational autonomous actor in maintaining its existence, ensuring its own security and in pursuit of its own selfishness with these primary objectives and thereby its sovereignty and existence
 Attempts to protect
 yathartwaadee maanate hai ki raashtra rajya apane hiton kii khoj main, apane liye sansadhano ko ekatra karnaa karne kaa prayaas he or ye rajyon ke bich ke sambandhon ko satta ke apane sambandhit staron dwaara nirdhaarit karte hai
 This level of power is determined by the military, economic and political capabilities of the state
 maanav swabhaav yathartwaadeeyon kaa maananaa he, ki rajya swaabhaavik rup se hi aakraamak hote hai atah kshetreey vistaar ko shaktiyon kaa virodh karke hi aseemabaddh kiya gaya he
 Whereas other offensive / defensive realists believe that states are always concerned about the security and continuity of their existence
 rakshaatmak drushtikon ek suraksha duvidha kii taraf le jaataa he, kyonki jahaan ek raashtra khud kii suraksha ko badhaane ke liye hathiyaar banataa he, to vahiin pratidwandvi bhi saath hi saath samanaantar laabh praapt karne kii koshish karata he
 So this process can lead to more instability
 Safety can only be seen as a zero-sum game / zero-accumulation game, where only relative advantage can be found
 nav yatharthwaad yaa sanrachanaatmak yatharthwaad, kenneth waltz dwaara apni pustak antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke siddhant main ise yatharthwaad ke hi unnat vikaas ke rup main prastut kiya tha
 Joseph Grieco has associated neo-realist ideas with more traditional realists
 siddhant kaa yah prakaar kabhi kabhi "aadhunik yatharthwaad" bhi kaha jaataa he
 Waltz's neo-realism states that the effect of structure should be taken as explaining state behavior
 sanrachana ko do roopon main paribhaashit kiya gaya he, pratham-antarrashtriya pranali kaa vyavastha siddhant, jo kii araajaktaa liye hue he or doosraa- ikaayiyon main kshamtaaon kaa vitaran
 Waltz also challenges traditional realism that emphasizes traditional military power rather than the combined capabilities of the state as demonstrative power
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ke udaaravaadi siddhanton kaa agradoot "adarshavaad" tha
 Idealism which saw itself as a criticism of realists
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main, adarshavaad ek vaicharik drushtikon he jo yah maanata he ki ek rajya ko apni videsh niti kaa lakshya nirdhaarit karne ke liye ise apane aantarik raajnneetik darshan main apnaanaa chahie
 For example, an idealist may believe that to alleviate poverty at home, as well as abroad, poverty must be worked together
 wilson kaa adarshavaad udaar antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton ke liye ek agradoot ke rup main tha, jo dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad "'sanstha nirmaataaon'" ke bich paidaa hua tha
 Liberalism holds that state preferences, rather than state capabilities, are the main determinants of state behavior
 yatharthwaad ke vipareet, jahaan rajya ek ekaatmak abhinayta ke rup main dekha jaataa he, vahin udaarvaad rajya ke kaaryon main bahulata ke liye anumati detaa he
 Thus, priorities will depend on different factors in different states, such as their culture, economic system or type of government
 udaaravaadi yah bhi maanate hai ki rajyon ke bich sampark keval raajnneetik athwa suraksha ke maamalon tak hi simit nahin he, jabaki inamen aarthik athwa saanskrithik maamalon ke liye bhi aapas main sampark hota rahata he, chaahe wo vanijyik companiyon, sanghathanon yaa vyaktiyon ke madhyam se hi ho
 Thus, despite a chaotic international system, many opportunities exist for a broad idea of cooperation and power, such as cultural capital
 ek anya dharna yah bhi he ki purna athwa saapeksh laabh keval sahyog or parsparik - nirbharta ke madhyam se hi praapt kiya ja saktaa he or is tarah se shanti ko hasil kiya ja saktaa he

 kitaab nevar at war main yah bhi tark diya gaya he, ki saamaanya rup se loktantric rajyon ne gaiyr loktantric rajyon se kootneeti ke maamle main bahut alag dhang se aacharan kiya he
 Realists reveal a disagreement in this theory of liberals, that they have often opposed state government, citing structural reasons for peace
 sebstian rosato, jo ki loktantric shanti siddhant kaa ek aalochak he, ne loktantric shanti ko chunauti dene ke liye sheet yuddh ke dauraan latin america main vampanthi jhukaav vaale loktantric deshon ke prati america ke vyavhaar ko ingit kiya he

 yah tark detaa he ki antarrashtriya sansthaayen raashtra-rajyon ko antarrashtriya vyavastha main safaltaapurvak sahyog karne ke liye anumati de sakati hai
 Answer- Liberal theory argues that states within the modern and globalized world are actually stepping up for cooperation to ensure their security and sovereign interests

 Michael Barnett describes how constructivist international relations theories are understood as ideas that define the international structure, how this structure defines the interests and identities of states, and how state and non-state actors define this structure Reproduce
 rachnawad ke pramukh siddhant yah maanate hai ki "antarrashtriya raajnneeti prerak vichaaron, samuhik mulyon, samskruti or saamaajik pahchaan dwaara nirmit hoti he

 Answer: Structuralism differs from most other approaches in international politics, as it does not see itself as a doctrine, school, or paradigm that only keeps track of a single subject

 plasi kaa yuddh 23 june 1757 ko murshidaabad ke dakshin main 22 mile dur nadiya jile main ganga nadi ke kinare 'plasi' naamak sthaan main hua tha
 In this war, on one side was the army of British East India Company and on the other side was the army of the Nawab of Bengal
 company kii sena ne robert clive ke netritv main nawab sirazuddaula ko haraa diya tha
 But this war cannot be considered as a victory of the company because before the war, Kalaiv had conspired with three generals of the Nawab, his courtier, and Amir Seth Jagat Seth, etc
 of the state
 nawab kii to puri sena ne yuddh me bhaag bhi nahi liya tha yuddh ke foran baad mir jaafar ke putr miran ne nawab kii hatya kar di thi
 War is considered very unfortunate for India, it is from this war that the story of India's slavery begins
 is yuddh se company ko bahut laabh hua wo ai to vyapaar hetu thi kintu ban gai raja
 Using the resources obtained from this war, the company decisively defeated the French company in the Third and Final War of Karnataka
 is yuddh ke baad bedara ke yuddh me company ne dch company ko haraaya tha
 Information about this war is available in the India House Library of London which is a very large library and there are 20 thousand documents of the time of India's slavery
 vahaan uplabdh dastavej ke hisaab se angrejon ke paas plasi ke yuddh ke samay maatr 300 sipaahi the or sirajudaula ke paas 18 hajaar sipaahi
 The commander of the British army was Robert Clive and the commander of Siraj-daulah was Mirzafar
 robert clive ye jaanata tha kii aamane saamne kaa yuddh hua to ek ghanta bhi nahin lagegaa or ham yuddh haar jaayenge or clive ne kai baar chitthee likh ke british parliament ko ye bataaya bhi tha
 Clive also has two letters in these documents
 jisame usne ye prarthana kii he ki agar plasi kaa yuddh jeetna he to mujhe or sipaahi die jaaen
 In response to this, a letter was sent from the British Parliament that we are currently fighting a war against Napoleon Bonaparte and this war is more important to us than Plassey and we cannot give you more soldiers than this
 robert clive ne tab apane do jasoos lagaaye or unase kaha kii ja ke pataa lagaao kii sirajudaula ke fuj main koi aisa aadmi he jise ham rishwat de laalach de or rishwat ke laalach main apane desh se gaddari kar sake
 His detectives found out that there is a man in his army who can sell Bengal in the name of bribe and if you give him the lure of a chair, he can sell seven books of Bengal too
 or wo aadmi tha mirajafar or mirajafar aisa aadmi tha jo din raat ek hi sapana dekhtaa tha kii wo kab bengal kaa nawab banegaa
 When Robert Clive learned these things, he wrote a letter to Mirzafar
 company ne iske baad kathputli nawab mir jafar ko satta de di kintu ye baat kisi ko pataa na thi ke satta company ke paas he
 Till the Nawab's court, he was called the donkey of Clive, the company officials had fiercely bribed the business of Bengal completely destroyed, apart from this there was utter chaos in Bengal
 plasi yuddh ke kaaran or parinaam' The Plassey War has a great importance in the history of modern India
 is yuddh ke dwaara east india company ne bengal ke nawab siraajudadaula ko parajeet kar bengal main british samrajya kii neenv daali
 Therefore, this war has a special place in the decisive wars of India
 bengal mughal samrajya kaa ek abhinn ang tha
 But after Aurangzeb's death, under it, he declared his independence in various provinces
 jisamen alvardi khan ne bengal par apana adhikaar kar liya
 He had no son
 sirf teen putriyaan thi
 The elder girl was a sixed Begum childless
 duusari or teesri se ek- ek putr the
 Which was named Shaukatganj, and Siraj-ud-daula
 ve sirajuddaula ko adhik pyaar karte the
 Therefore, during his life time he had declared his successor
 10 april 1756 ko alvardi kii mrityu hui
 And Siraj-ud-daula became the Nawab of Bengal but from the very beginning his struggle with the East India Company became inevitable
 ant main 23 june 1757 ko donon ke bich yuddh chhidaa jise plasi yuddh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 There were many reasons for this war which are as follows
 aantarik sangharsh- Siraj-ud-daula faced the struggle of Shaukatganj as soon as he sat on the throne as Shaukatganj wanted to become the Nawab
 isamen chhasiti begum tathaa uske divaan rajwallaav or mughal samraat kaa samarthan use praapt tha is liye sirajuddaula ne sabase pehle us aantarik sangharsh ko sulajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 Because of this, the interference of British in Bengal politics was increasing, the Nawab killed Shaukatganj
 or iske pashchaat usne angrejon se muqabla karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Conspiracy against the Nawab by the British prarambh se hi angrejon kii aakhen bengal par lagi hui thi
 Because Bengal was a fertile and rich province
 agar bengal par company kaa adhikaar ho jaataa to use adhik se adhik dhan kamaane kii aashaa thi
 Not only this, they joined the Hindu traders and started provoking them against the Nawab
 The Nawab did not like it
 vyapaarik suvidhaon kaa upyog- The British were allowed to do free maritime trade by the Mughal emperor but the British started misusing it
 ve apana vyaktigat vyapaar bhi ni:shulk karne lage or deshi vyapaariyon ko bina chungi die vyapaar karne ke liye protsaahit karne lage
 This caused economic damage to the Nawab
 nawab inhen pasand nahin karata tha jab, unhone vyapaarik suvidhaon ke durupyog ko band karne kaa nishchay kiya to angrej sangharsh par utar aae
 Forts were closed by the British is samay europe main saptavarshiya yuddh chhidane kii ashanka thi
 In which England and France were to fight against each other, so also in other country which were British and French
 unhe yuddh kii ashanka thi
 So to strengthen his position, he started fortifications
 nawab ise bardaast nahin kar saktaa tha
 The British did not recognize Siraj-ud-daula as Nawab
 bengal kii pracheen parampara ke anusaar agar koi nayaa nawab gaddi par baithta tha to us din darvaar lagati thi
 And the representatives of the kings, rich or foreign castes residing under him had to present and present gifts in the court
 ki ve naye nawab ko sweekaar karte hai
 But on the occasion of the coronation of Siraj-ud-daula, no British representative appeared in the court
 kyonki ve sirajuddaula ko nawab nahin maanate the iske chalate bhi donon ke bich sangharsh kii sanmbhaavna badhati gai
 Trying to change the Nawab angrej sirajuddaula ko hataa kar kisi aise vyakti ko nawab bananaa chaahate the jo uske ishaare par chalane ke liye taiyaar ho iske liye angrejon ne prayaas karnaa shuru kiya
 In such a situation, the struggle could not be avoided
 kalakatta par akraman- When the Nawab issued an order to stop the captivity of the fort, the British paid no heed to him and he continued to build the fort
 isapar nawab krodhit ho uthaa or 4 june 1756 ko kasimbazar kii kothi par akraman kar diya
 The British soldiers were frightened by this attack and the British were defeated and the Nawab took over the Qasim Bazar
 iske baad nawab ne shighr hi kalakatta ke fort wilia par akraman kiya yahan angrej sainik bhi nawab ke samaksh tik nahin paaya or isapar bhi nawab kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 In this war, many British soldiers were arrested
 kaali kothri kii durghatana- In the above battle, the Nawab imprisoned 146 British soldiers, then locked him in a small dark cell, its length was 18 feet and width was 14-10 feet
 yah angrejon ke dwaara banaaya gaya tha or isamen bhartiya aparaadhiyon ko band kiya jaataa tha
 Since it was a hot summer day and the culmination of the war, 123 soldiers died due to suffocation and 23 soldiers survived, including Yeswell, an English soldier
 usee ke is ghatana kii jaankaree madras ke angrejon ko di
 This accident is known as the black closet accident
 iske chalate angrejon kaa krodh bhadak uthaa or ve nawab se yuddh kii taiyaari karne lage
 The British re-occupied Calcutta
 apni paraajay kaa badla lene ke liye angrej ne sheeghra hi kalakatta par akraman kar diya
 At this time the Nawab appointed Manikchand as the king of Calcutta
 lekin vah angrejon kaa mitra or shubhachintak tha
 As a result, the British conquered Calcutta was freed from the clutches of the Nawab
 9 farvari 1757 ko donon ke bich ali nagar kii sandhi hui or angrejon ko phir se sabhi tarah ke vyavhaarik adhikaar uplabdh ho gaya
 British invasion of French angrejon ne francisiyon kii vasti chand nagar par akraman kar diya
 And took him under control
 francisi nawab ke mitra the isliye nawab is ghatana se kaaphi kshubdh the
 Secret treaty with Mirzafar - isi samay angrejon ne nawab ko padchyut karne ke liye ek shadyantra rachaa
 Many people of the Nawab were also involved in this
 jaise- raidurlabh pradhan senapati mirajafar or dhani vyapakir jagat sevak aadi
 The British made a temptation to make Mirzafar the Nawab of Bengal and after this treaty of secret treaty with him, the Nawab was accused that he had violated the treaty of Ali Nagar and by making the same excuse, the British attacked the Nawab on 22 June 1757
 Attacked
 plasi yuddh ke maidan main ghamaasan yuddh prarambh hua mirajafar to pehle hi angrejon se sandhi kar chukaa tha falat: nawab kii jabardast paraajay hui
 The British won
 nawab kii hatya kar di gai or mirajafar ko bengal kaa nawab banaaya gaya
 Results of the Battle of Plassey plasi yuddh ke dwaara bengal main british samrajya kii neenv daali gai
 The British were made Nawabs
 plasi kaa yuddh vastav main koi yuddh nahin tha yah ek shadyantra or vishwasghaati kaa pradarshan tha prasiddh itihaaskaar ‘panivkar’ ke anusaar plasi kaa yuddh nahin, parantu iskaa parinaam kaaphi mahatvapurn niklaa
 Therefore, it has a place in the decisive wars of the world
 kyonki isi ke dwaara bengal main british samrajya kii neenv daali gai
 Clive has called this war a revolution
 vastav main yah ek kranti thi kyonki iske dwaara bhartiya itihaas kii dhara main mahaan parivartan aa gaya or ek vyapaarik sanstha ne bengal kii rajanithik bagdor apane haathon main le lee
 Different types of results are visible
 raajnneetik parinaam- Its political consequences proved fatal for India
 iske dwaara ek vyapaarik sanstha ke haathon main raajnneetik adhikaron kaa samavesh hua or bharat main angreji satta kaayam hua
 In fact, it was of great importance to the British nation, after this war Mirzafar was made the Nawab of Bengal
 parantu yah k ayogy vyakti tha
 Taking the disqualification of its inefficiency, the actual ruler of Bengal became the British
 bengal par angrejon kaa prabhaav badhata gaya or dhire- 2 british samrajya ke vistaar kaa maarg saaf hota gaya
 With the withdrawal of siraj-ud-daula, the British had the advantage of increasing political dominance
 mughal samrajya ke liye bi plasi kaa parinaam ghaatak siddh hua bengal se prativarsh mughal shaasha ko acchhee aamadani hoti thi lekin ab yah aamadani samaapt ho gai
 The British came to know about the weakness of the Indian King
 bhavishya main usne uskaa kaaphi phayda uthaaya or uttari bharat kii vijay kaa maarg prashast hua
 Economic consequences is yuddh ke dwaara angrejon ko kaaphi aarthik laabh pahunchaa mirajafar ne company ko 1 karod 17 lakh rupee diye jisase company kii aarthik sthiti kaaphi majboot ho gai bengal kii lut se bi use kaaphi dhan haath laga
 The monastery employees of the company got Rs 12 and a half lakh
 clive ko do lakh 24 hajaar rupye mili
 After this war, the company gradually became the 2nd Diwan of Bengal
 is prakaar iske dwaara bharat main british samrajya kii neenv daali gai
 The British got the right to trade again
 Mirzafar provided 3 crore rupees to the company as an encroachment and the business also made a profit of 15 crores
 By- Mohammad Shahid a new political power emerged from this incident
 company ke hit raajnneeti se jud gaye or vah prabhutv prapti me jute gayi
 The weakness of the Mughal Empire was also cleared
 company ko bharat ke shaasha varg kii charitra, foot kaa pataa lag gaya

 isamen itane adhik vishyon kaa samavesh he ki ise 'bhartiya samskruti kaa vishwakosh' kaha jaataa he
 In spite of not insisting on these requests, one has to believe that the tradition of creating knowledge in the western sense is relatively new in India

 Under this tradition, nigantu of various disciplines were prepared, including the nigantu of Ayurveda composed of Dhanvantari

 Apart from Nighantu and Nirukta, works such as Shridhar Sen's Kosh Kalpataru, Raja Radhakanta Dev Bahadur's 1822 work Shabdakalpadrum, published between 1873 and 1883, Taranath Bhattacharya Vachaspati Krita Vachaspatyam, may possibly be placed in the category of knowledge
 paanchavin-chhathi se lekar attharahavin sadi tak kii avadhi main rache gayi anginat nammala koshon main amarsingh dwaara rachit amarkosh kaa sheersh sthaan he
 At the heart of this traditional Indian enterprise of lexicography was words and vocabulary

 This book of twenty five volumes was published in 1917
 khud mahatma gandhi ne ise upyogi bataate hue apni sanstuti main likhaa ki yah bharat kii ‘lingua-franka’ hindi ke vikaas main sahaayak hoga

 The plan for the implementation of an original and authentic encyclopaedia in the national language Hindi was prepared by the Nagri Pracharini Sabha, Kashi, with the inspiration of the then Chairman, His Excellency Pt

 Accordingly, under the joint aegis of the Central Hindi Institute, Agra and the Center for Electronic Research and Development, Noida, and the joint funding of the Ministry of Human Resource Development and Ministry of Information Technology, the work of presenting Hindi encyclopedia on the Internet started in April 2000
 vishvakoshon kii sanrachana computer ke liye vishesh rup se upyukt he
 That is why most of the encyclopedias have come up in the appropriate format for computers by the end of the 20th century
 sidi-rome aadi main uplabdh vishvakoshom ke nimnlikhit laabh hai: Yogadarshan is the most famous of the six theistic philosophies
 is darshan kaa pramukh lakshya manushya ko vah param lakshya kii prapti kar sake
 Like other philosophies, Yogadarshan presents the philosophy of salvation mainly by not getting entangled in the questions of philosophy
 kintu moksh par charchaa karne vaale prayek darshan kii koi na koi tathvik prishtabhumi honi aavashyak he
 Therefore, for this Yogadarshan resorts to Sankhyadarshana and accepts the philosophy of philosophy propounded by him
 isaliye prarambh se hi yogadarshan, sankhyadarshan se judaa hua he
 a great practical and psychological form of philosophy has been presented in Yogadarshan for the spiritual, mental and physical advancement of human life by combining the existence of God prakruti, purush ke swarup ke saath ishwar ke astitv ko milakar manushya jivan kii aadhyatmik, maansik or shaareerik unnati ke liye darshan kaa ek bada vyaavhaarik or manovaigyanik rup yogadarshan main prastut kiya gaya he
 It begins with the Yogasutras of Patanjali Muni
 yogasutron kii sarvottam vyakhya vyas muni dwaara likhit vyasabhashya main praapt hoti he
 It explains how a person can succeed in life by keeping control of his mind's instincts and can achieve his ultimate goal Nirvana
 yogadarshan, sankhya kii tarah dwaitvaadi he
 Completely accepting the philosophy of Sankhya only adds 'god' to it
 isaliye yogadarshan ko 'seshwar sankhya' kehete hai or sankhya ko ' kaha jaataa he
 In Yogadarshan, the male element is presented as the central theme
 yadhyapi purush or prakruti donon kii swatantra satta maani gayi he parantu tathvik rup main purush kii satta hi sarvocch he
 There are two distinctions of a man
 purush ko chaitanya evam aprinami kaha gaya he, kintu avidya ke kaaran purush jad evam parinaam chitt main swayan ko aropit kar letaa he
 When the man and the mind are combined, the conscience goes away and the man starts to experience himself in the mind
 yah agyaan hi purush ke samast duhkhon, cleshon kaa kaaran hai
 The purpose of Yoga philosophy is to free the man from this misery, ignorance
 isi tathy ko saiddhanthik rup se yoga darshan main hey, hey-hetu, haan or hanopay ke rup main prastut kiya gaya he
 In these four stages, a man is free from sorrows, so in yoga it is called 'chaturvuhvad' and the ultimate aim of yoga is to be free from this Chaturvuh
 chaturvuhwaad kii vivechna main hi yoga darshan main purush, purushaarth or purusharthshoonyata kaa darshan prakat hota he
 a man falls into the world cycle when he is not insolvent and attains a state of maleficity
 purush kaa param lakshya kaivalya kii prapti he
 In yoga, man is considered synonymous with soul
 atah aatma, jo ki sankhya main asankhya he, uski kaivalya prapti tabhi ho sakati he jab chaturvyuuh kaa purushaarth saadhan kar dukh ke trividh roopon kaa samaadhan kar liya jaay
 There are three forms of grief - spiritual, semi-physical and semi-spiritual
 purusharthshoonyata in tritapon se upar kii avasthaa he
 It is only after male incapacitation that a man has his own status
 yogadarshan main ise hi kaivalya athwa moksh kaha gaya he
 Patanjali is informed by Kapil
 thode main, is darshan ke anusaar is jagat main asankhya purush hai or ek pradhan yaa mul prakruti
 The man is the mind, the primeval figure
 purush nity he or aparivartansheel, pradhan bhi nity he parantu parivartansheel
 Both are always separate from each other, but in one way one has influence on the other
 purush ke saannnidhya se prakruti main parivartan hone lagate hai
 She gets angry
 pehle usamen mahat yaa buddhi kii utpatti hoti he, phir ahankaar kii, phir man kii
 From the ego, the sense organs and the karmadrias and the five tantramatras, namely, words, touch, form, rasa and smell, finally from these five mahabhutas named Akash, Vayu, Tej, Up and Kshiti
 in sabake sanyog viyog se is vishwa kaa khel ho rahaa he
 In short, this is the order of creation
 prakruti main parivartan bhale hi ho parantu purush jyon kaa tyon rahata he
 Yet one thing happens
 jaise shwet sphatik ke saamne rang birange phulon ko laane se usapar unka rangeen pratibimb padataa he, isi prakaar purush par prakritik vikrutiyon ke pratibimb padate hai
 Gradually, he seems to be chiseled from intellect to injury, considering himself to be associated with these vices of nature
 aaj apane ko dhani, nirdhan, balvan durbal, kutumbi, sukhi, du:khee, aadi maan rahaa he
 Has gone away from its pure form
 yah uskaa bhram, avidya he
 These materials made from the staple have covered his form, many folds have opened on him
 yadi vah in kholon, in aavarnon ko dur phenk de to uskaa chhutkaaraa ho jaayga
 The order in which it is tied will break the bond in the opposite order
 pehle mahabhuton se upar uthanaa hoga
 Finally, you will have to face the head
 yah bandhan vaastavik nahin he, parantu bahut hi drudh prathit hote hai
 Yoga is the name of the method by which a man can be in his pure form by breaking the bonds
 sankhya ke aacharyo kaa kahana he: yadwa tadwa taduchhiti: parampurusharthah - jaise bhi ho sake purush or pradhan ke is kritrim sanyog kaa uchchhed karnaa param purusharth hai
 This is the philosophical plane of yoga: the condition that occurs when avidya is overcome has been described by different masters and thinkers in different ways
 apane-apane vichaar ke anusaar unhone usko pruthak naam bhi die hai
 Some call him Kaivalya, some salvation, some nirvana
 upar pahunchakar jisko jaisaa anubhav ho vah use us prakaar kahe
 In fact, that state is like this, whereo the Wacho outgoing unattainable Mansa Sah - where the mind and speech have no access
 thode se shabdon main ek or baat kaa bhi charchaa kar dena aavashyak he
 Patanjali, along with innumerable men, has also assumed the authority of God under the name 'purusha special'
 sankhya ke acharya aisa nahin maanate
 In fact, there is no need to obey
 yadi yogadarshan main se vah thode se sutara nikaal bhi len to koi antar nahin padataa
 In terms of the practice of yoga, it is not very important to believe or not to believe in God
 ishwar kii satta ko maanane vaale or na maanane vaale, donon yoga main samaan rup se adhikaar rakhte hai
 Knowledge and ignorance, bondage and redemption, happiness and sorrow are all in the mind
 at: jo koi apane swaroop main sthiti paane kaa icchhuk he usko apane chitt ko un vastuon se hataane kaa praytn karnaa hoga, jo hathaat pradhan or uske vikaron kii ore khinchati hai or sukh du:kha kii anubhuti utpann karti hai
 In this way, the name of removing the mind and moving away from such things of the mind is disinterest
 yah yoga kii pehali seedhi he
 Absolute quietness does not happen at all
 jyon jyon vyakti yoga kii sadhana main pravrutt hota he tyon tyon vairaygy bhi badhata he or jyon jyon veraygya badhata he tyon tyon sadhana main pravriti badhati he
 Like Patanjali has said: There should be detachment, detachment in Gandhi ji's words, in both visions and disciplines
 swarg aadi, jinka gyaan hamako anushruti arthath mahatmaon ke vachanon or dharmagranthon se hota he, anushravik kehalaate hai
 The practice of yoga is called practice
 idhar kai sau varsho se saadhuon main is armbh main bhajan shabd bhi chal padaa he
 As long as the mind moves towards the subjects of the senses, it will remain fickle
 indriyaan uskaa ek ke baad duusari bhogy vastu se sampark karaati rahengi
 How many will also get disconnected
 kaam, krodh, lobh, aadi ke uddipt hone ke saikadon avasar aate rahenge
 There will be constant feeling of happiness and sorrow
 is prakaar pradhan ore uske vikaron ke saath jo bandhan anek janmon se chale aa rahe hai ve drudh se drudhtar hote chale jaayenge
 Therefore, the mind has to be drawn from the subjects of the senses and inward
 iske anek upaay bataae gaye hai jinke byore main jane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The state of mind of an ordinary person is called Kshatpa
 vah ek vishay se duusare vishay kii ore phenkaa phirata he
 When he is tried and brought to any one subject, he moves quickly towards the poison
 is avasthaa ko veikshipt kehete hai
 After long efforts, the seeker can keep him on any one subject for a long time
 is avasthaa kaa naam ekagra he
 It is very difficult to subdue the mind
 shrikrishna ne ise pramathi balwat-mast hathi ke samaan balvan-bataaya he
 One thing helps to subdue the mind
 yah saadhaaran anubhav kii baat he ki jab tak sharir chanchal rahata he, chitt chanchal rahata he or chitt kii chanchalta sharir ko chanchal banaae rahati he
 The versatility of the body depends on the versatility of the institution
 jab tak nadisanthaan sankshubdh rahegaa, sharir par indriya grahya vishyon ke aadhaat hote rahenge
 Those souls will have an effect on the brain, as a result of which the mind and body will remain fickle
 chitt ko nishchal banane ke liye yogi vaisaa hi upaay karata he jaisaa kabhi-kabhi yuddh main karnaa padataa he
 If his friends can be defeated in fighting a strong enemy, then the chances of success increase
 yogi chitt par adhikaar paane ke liye sharir or usamen bhi mukhyat: nadisanthaan, ko vash main karne kaa praytn karata he
 Body is physical, nadis are also physical
 isaliye inase nipatna sahaj he
 The process that proves this thing has two parts: Asana and Pranayama
 asana se sharir nishchal banataa he
 Many asanas are practiced in terms of health
 patanjali ne itnaa hi kaha he: sthir sukhmasanam : jisapar der tak bina ksht ke baitha ja sake vahi asana shreshth he
 It is true that for health, some rules related to health are necessary
 jaisaa shrikrishna ne gita main kaha he- Eating, drinking, sleeping, waking all have to be controlled
 pranayam shabd ke sambandh main bahut bhram failaa hua he
 The reason for this confusion is that today people have often forgotten the meaning of the word prana
 bahut se aise log bhi, jo apane ko yogi kehete hai, is shabd ke sambandh main bhul karte hai
 a yogi has to make an effort to take his life in the spinal cord
 sushumna vah naadee he jo merudand kii nalee main sthit he or masttishk ke neeche tak pahunchati he
 This is not a secret thing
 aankhon se dekhi ja sakati he
 The forearm is roughly as thick as a finger, is solid, there is no hole in it
 praan kaa or saans yaa hawa karanevaalon ko is baat kaa pataa nahin he ki is naadee main hawa ke ghusane ke liye or upar chadhane ke liye koi maarg nahin he
 Such things are said by considering life as a synonym for air that such a great Mahatma has taken his breath in the universe
 saans par niyantran rakhane se nadisanthaan ko sthir karne main nishchay hi sahaayta milti he, parantu yogi kaa mukhya uddeshy praan kaa niyantran he, saans kaa nahin
 Prana is the power that communicates in the umbilical cord
 sharir ke sabhi avyavon ko or sabhi dhaatuon ko praan se hi jivan or sakriyata milti he
 When the body is stabilized and by the action of pranayama, the life moves towards the spinal cord, its flow is drawn from the lower nostrils
 at: ye naadiyaan baahar ke aadhaaton kii ore se ek prakaar se shoonyavat ho jaati hai
 Practicing Pranayam and getting success in Pranayama are two different things
 parantu vairaygy or teevr samveg ke bal se safalataa kaa maarg prashast ho jaataa he
 As the practice becomes stronger, the confidence of the seeker increases
 ek or baat hoti he
 The more he draws his mind away from the senses and his subjects, the more his sense of power also increases, that is, the power of enjoyment of the subjects of the senses also increases
 isiliye pranayam ke baad pratyaahaar kaa naam liya jaataa he
 Pratyahara means to draw the senses from their subjects
 vairaygy ke prasang main yah upadesh diya ja chukaa he parantu pranyam tak pahanchakar iskon vishesh rup se duhraane kii aavashyaktaa he
 Hatha Yoga is the name of the set of postures, pranayama and pratyahar
 khed kii baat he ki kuch abhyaasi yaheen ruk jate hai
 The path of those who move forward is divided into three divisions: dharana, meditation and samadhi
 in teenon ko ek duusare se bilkul pruthak karnaa asambhav he
 Dharana becomes a form of meditation after being confirmed and advanced meditation is called samadhi
 patanjali ne teenon ko sammilit rup se sanyam kaha he
 Dharana is the remedy that helps to concentrate the mind
 yahan upaay shabd kaa ekvachan main prayog hua he parantu vastut: is kaam ke anek upaay hai
 Some of these have come up in the Upanishads
 vaidic vadmay main vidya shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The chanting of a mantra, the deity of a god, a goddess or a mahatma, or the setting of the Sun, Agni, Deepshikha, etc
, in a particular place of the body like heart, idol, mole, ie the point between the two eyes, in some of these places in the imagination, thus All the measures to be taken are under the assumption
 jaisaa ki kuch upayon ko batalaane ke baad patanjali ne yah likh diya he - yathabhimat dhyanadva-jo vastu apane ko acchhee lage usapar hi chitt ko ekagra karne se kaam chal saktaa he
 There is a legend in a Purana that an uneducated person had attained samadhi through his buffalo by converting the mind through his buffalo, on the orders of his guru
 dharna kii sabase uttam paddati vah he jise puraane shabdon main nadanusandhan kehete hai
 Kabir and his later saints have termed it the word Surāt Yoga
 jis prakaar chanchal mrug veena ke swaron se mugdh hokar chaukadi bharna bhul jaataa he, usee prakaar sadhak kaa chitt naad ke prabhaav se chanchalta chhodkar sthir ho jaataa he
 Which is the sound in which an attempt is made to rhythm the attitudes of the mind and how this effort is made, these things are known only from Gurmukh
 antarnad ke sookshmattam rup ko praval, onkaar, kehete hai
 Pranav is virtually nonchalant
 uskaa anubhav kiya ja saktaa he, vaani main vyanjana nahin, nadavindupanishad ke shabdon main: From Pranav's research, the astrological and welfare nad arises
 phir aatma swayan usee prakaar prakat hota he, jese ki badal ke hatane par chandramaa prakat hota he
 The initial word figure is called the symbol of the divine
 yogiyon main sarvatra hi isaki mahima gaai gai he
 In the section of the Bible, called Saint John's Gospel, the first sentence is as follows, the beginning was the word
 vah shabd paramatma ke saath tha
 That word was divine
 sufi sant kehete hai haif dar bande jism darmani, na shunavi saute paake rahamaani du:kha kii baat he ki tu sharir ke bandhan main padaa rahata he or pavitra divya naad ko nahin sunata
 As the concentration of the mind increases, the practitioner has many experiences
 manushya apni indriyon kii shakti se parichit nahin he
 Neither takes nor wants to take from them
 yah baat sunne main aashcharya kii prathit hoti he, par sach he
 Suppose, the power of our eye or the brain of the senses increases manifold from today
 tab na jane aisi kitni vastuen drushtigochar hone lagengi jinako dekhakar ham kaanp uthenge
 If you see the chemical activity within each other, then your loved one will be hated by the person
 hamaare param mitra paas kii kothri main baithe hamaare sambandh main kya kehete hai, yadi yah baat sunne main aa jaay to jeena dubhar ho jaay
 We are effigies of some lusts
 apni indrayon se vahiin tak kaam lete hai jahaan tak vaasanaon kii tripti ho
 That is why the power of the senses remains dormant, but when there is a maximum suppression of lusts through yoga practice, then the senses can work uninterruptedly and give us some idea of the true form of the world
 is vishwa main sparsh, rup, ras or gandh kaa apaar bhandar bharaa padaa he jisaki satta kaa hamako anubhav nahin hai
 On being introverted, the senses open the door of this store in front of us without our efforts
 sushumna main naadiyon kii kai granthiyaan hai, jinamein kai jagahon se ai hui naadiyaan milti hai
 These places are called Chakras
 inamen se vishesh rup se chah chakron kaa charchaa yoga ke granthon main aata he
 At the bottom is the muladhar which is usually at the place where the spinal cord begins
 or sabase upar ajna chakra he jo til ke sthaan par he
 It is also called the third eye
 thodaa or upar chalakar sushumna mastishk ke naadisanthaan se mil jaati he
 At the topmost place of the brain called the cerebrum in physiology is the Sahasrarachakra
 jaisaa ki ek mahatma ne kaha he: Mantmantra Karaband Vichari Seven Chakras New Shodhai Nari
 
 Some of the yogi's early experiences are indicated above
 aise kuch anubhavon kaa ullekh shwetashwar upanishad main bhi kiya gaya he
 There he has said that Anal, Anil, Surya, Chandra, Khadyot, Dhoom, Sphulling, Tare are expressive Yogis, all these are the signs to express in Yoga, that is, through this Yogi can believe that i am following the right path
 iske upar samadhi tak pahonchte pahonchte yogi ko jo anubhav hote hai unka varnan karnaa asambhav he
 The reason is that ordinary people do not find any symbol or word to describe them
 achche yogiyon ne unke varnan ke sambandh main kaha he ki yah kaam vaisaa hi he jaise goonga gud khaay
 Even a full person cannot describe the taste of an object in words, then the poor poor are unable
 gud ke swaad kaa kuch parichay falon ke swaad se yaa kisi anya mithi chiz ke saadrishy ke aadhaar par diya bhi ja saktaa he, par jaisaa anubhav hamako saadhaarant: hota hi nahin, vah to sachmuch vaani ke pare hai
 Asmita remains down to a little below the supreme role of Samadhi
 apni pruthak satta aham asmi yah pratiti rahati he
 Ahm asmi = i am the child, that is, because of this constant feeling there is the power of time
 iske baad jhini avidya maatr rah jaati he
 The state of his death is named asamprajnata samadhi in which avidya also decays and the imaginary relationship with the head is severed
 yah yoga kii paraakaashtha he
 Next, the door of scripture opens again

 kai vyakti use dekh rahe hai
 There is a person among them who has no interest in that dance
 vah nartki kii ore se aankh pher letaa he
 There is no dance for him
 duusare ke liye vah rochak he
 He has said that with that aja, that is, with the nitya, aja ekolanushete = one does ajaan and Jahatyenam bhuktabhogam tathanya: - Satisfied by his enjoyment and gives up another
 advait vedant ke acharya sankhyasammat purushon kii anekta ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Apart from them, there are many philosophical sects which have their own different doctrines
 pehle kaha ja chukaa hai ki is shastrarth main yahaan padane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hai
 As far as the practical form of yoga is concerned, no one is opposed to it
 vedant ke acharya bhi nirdidhyasana kii upyogita ko sweekaar karte hai or vedant darshan main vyas ne bhi asakridabhyasat ore asin: sambhwata jaise sutron main iskaa samarthan kiya he
 This much is enough for us
 saadhaarant: yoga ko ashtaang kaha jaataa he parantu yahan ab tak asana se lekar samadhi tak chah angon kaa hi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The remaining two organs are not left out because they are unnecessary, but because they are not only a yogi but are extremely useful only to human beings

 For those who do not accept the authority of God, there is no one else to have allegiance to God
 parantu vah log bhi praaia: kisi na kisi aise vyakti par shraddha rakhte hai jo unke liye ishwar tulya he
 The allegiance Buddhist has to Buddhadev is no less than what any theist would have on God
 ek or baat he
 Whether one has reverence for God or not, there should be exclusive reverence for the teacher of yoga path
 yogabhyasi ke liye guru kaa sthaan kisi bhi drushti se ishwar se kam nahin
 God may or may not exist, but there can be no doubt about the existence of a guru
 ek sadhak charnadas ji kii shishyaa sahjobai ne kaha he: Now-a-days it is heard that knowledge is sufficient to achieve ultimate effort
 yoga kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Those who say so do not seriously consider the meaning of the word knowledge
 gyaan do prakaar kaa hota he-tajgyaan or tadvishyak gyaan
 There is a difference between the two
 koi vyakti apana sara jivan rasayan aadi shastron ke adhyayan main bitaakar shakkar ke sambandh main jaankaree praapt kar saktaa he
 Which chemical elements have how many atoms in a sugar molecule? How is Sugar Made? What are the normal actions and reactions on it? And so on
 yah sab shakkar vishyak gyaan he
 This can also be useful, but the actual knowledge of sugar is only when a pinch of sugar is placed in the mouth
 yah shakkar kaa tatvagyan he
 The knowledge gained from the study of the scriptures is true spiritual knowledge and in the light of this, the knowledge that is perceptible can also be fully understood
 isiliye upanishad ke anusaar jab yama ne nachiketa ko aadhyatm gyaan kaa upadesh diya to uske saath main yogavidhi c kritsnam kii bhi diksha di, nahin to nachiketa kaa bodh adhuraa hi rah jaataa
 Those who praise Bhakti etc
 in a spiritual way should also keep in mind that if there is any way to concentrate the finances in their path, then it is really under the concept of Yoga
 yah unki marji he ki sanathan yoga shabd ko chhodkar naye shabdon kaa vyavhaar karte hai
 The practice of yoga gives rise to the kind of powers which are called Vibhuti or Siddhi
 yadi paryaapt samay tak abhyaas karne ke baad bhi kisi manushya main aisi asaadhaaran shaktiyon kaa aagam nahin hua to yah maananaa chahie ki vah thik maarg par nahin chal rahaa he
 But there is no magic in siddhis
 indriyon kii shakti bahut adhik he parantu saadhaarant: hamako uskaa gyaan nahin hota or na ham usase kaam lete hai
 The practitioner gets to know about that power, he has such experiences in relation to the nature of the world which others do not have
 dur kii yaa chhipi hui vastu ko dekh lenaa, vyavahrut baton ko sun lenaa ityadi indriyon kii sahaj shakti kii seemaa ke bheetar kii bate hai parantu saadhaaran manushya ke liye yah aashcharyash kaa vishay hai, inakon siddhi kaha jaayga
 Similarly, there are many more powers in humans which remain dormant in the normal state
 yoga ke abhayas se jaag uthati hai
 If we are going somewhere on a road, then going ahead towards our goal, we will see the subjects present on the right and left
 sach to yah he ki jo koi in vishyon ko dekhne ke liye rukegaa vah gantavya sthaan tak pahunchega hi nahin ore bich main hi rah jaayga
 That is why it is said that whoever tries for Siddhis deprives himself of samadhi
 patanjali ne kaha he: That is, these icons are obstacles in samadhi, but in the state of rising from samadhi, it is called siddhi
