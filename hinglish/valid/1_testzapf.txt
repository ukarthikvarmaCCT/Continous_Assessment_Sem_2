 Hindi story is the major narrative genre of Hindi literature
 aadhunik hindi kahani kaa aarambh 20 veen sadi main hua
 In the past century, Hindi story has made many achievements in the long journey through idealism, realism, progressivism, psychoanalyticism, regionalism, etc
 nirmal verma ke ve din jaise kahani sangrah sahitya academy se bhi sammanit ho chuke hai
 Premchand, Jainendra, Agnayya, Yashpal, Phaniswanath Renu, Usha Priyamvada, Mannu Bhandari, Gyanranjan, Uday Prakash, Omprakash Balmiki etc
 are the major story cars of Hindi
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne kishorilaal goswami likhit 'indumati' ko hindi kii pehali kahani mana he
 Generally two objections have been raised regarding this - one is that it may not be a translation of a Bengali story and the other is that it has a shadow of Tempest
 kaal-kram kii drashti se acharya shukla likhit 'gyaarah varsh kaa samay' duusari kahani thaharti he
 But even before these stories were written
 unki ore sanyogvash kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya
 In the 70s, 'sarika' published commentaries on the first Hindi story
 shri verma ne madhavaprasad sapre kii 'tokari bhar mitti' ko hindi kii pehali kahani siddh karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The story 'pranayani' written by Kishori Lal Goswami is the first original story of Hindi
 yah san 1897 i main likhi gai thi
 It tells the story of two lovers
 premi premika ke ghar main pravisht hone kaa upkram kar hi rahaa tha ki raja dwaara chor samaj kar pakad liya gaya
 But after getting acquainted with their deep love, the king got them both married
 is par kathasaritsagar kaa prabhaav he
 The style is old, the ending is also from the Bharata sentence
 kintu yadi kahani kii pahchaan kathanmak style tathaa ek hi kendriya bhaavana ke aadhaar par kii jaayegi to yah nishciya hi hindi kii sarvapratham moulik kahani tehregi
 In fact, 1900 AD to 1915 AD was the first phase of development of Hindi story
 man kii chanchalta 1907 i gulbahaar 1902 i, pandit or panditani 1903 i, gyaarah varsh kaa samay 1903 i, duliwali 1907 i, vidya bahaar 1909 i, rakhiband bhai 1909 i, gram 1911 i, sukhmay jivan 1911 i, rasiyaa balam 1912 i, paradesi 1912 i, kaanon main kangana 1913 i, rakshabandhan 1913 i, usne kaha tha 1915 i, aadi ke prakaashan se siddh hota he ki is praarambhik kaal main hindi kahaniyon ke vikaas ke sabhi chinh mil jate hai
 By 1950, an elaborate phase of the Hindi story ends and the Hindi story enters a period of maturity
 san 1916 i, premchand kii pehali kahani sout prakashit hui
 With the advent of Premchand, Hindi fiction turned towards social truth
 premchand kii aakhri kahani 'kafan' 1936 i, main prakashit hui or usee varsh unka dehavsaan bha hua
 Many trends in the story emerged in this period of twenty years
 kintu in pravritiyon ko alag alag na dekhakar yadi samagrat: dekha jaay to is samooche kaal ko adarsh or yatharth ke dwandv ke rup main liya ja saktaa he
 'prasad' and Premchand represent stories in this period
 prasad mukhyat romentic kahanikar hai
 But Indrajal, Gunda, Salim, and punctuation, stored in his last story collection 'indrajal', can be identified with his real-life tendency
 par romentic hone ke kaaran ve adarshavaadi the
 Premchand has called himself an idealistic realist
 vastut: ve bhi adarshavaadi the
 But in the last period of his development, he became realistic after realizing the bitterness of reality
 'pus kii raat' or 'kafan' iske pramaan hai
 In the year '33, a collection of Nirala 'lily' was published
 uski kahaniyaan bahut kuch yathartwaadee hi hai
 Prasad's romantic ideal is also reflected in his early stories
 par chandradhar sharma 'guleri' kii kahani 'usne kaha tha' main yah apni puri rangini main miltaa he
 Prasad's important romantic stories were written after 'he Said'
 'usne kaha tha' apane pariparshv, charitra-kalpana, parinti main romentic he
 Premature sacrifice, sacrifice - even the recollection of death all fulfill some romantic ideal
 aath varsh kii ladki or baarah varsh ke ladke main jis prem kaa udai hota he vah pachchis varshon ke interval ke baad bhi is tarah ubhar aata he ki us romentic prem ke nimitt lahana singh praan de detaa he
 Reality has been ignored to protect this ideal
 is kahani kii takneekee uplabdhiyaan abhootpurv hai
 He is the first credit for incorporating theatricality, spatial color, color setting, vibrant narration, flashbacks, dreams, etc
 in the story
 prasad ne apni kahaniyon main gulerji kii katipay takneekee visheshtaon ko grahan kiya ha par ve mulat pragitatmak hai
 In elements, the narrative element is less, the emotion is more
 ve chhayavaad ke pratinidhi kavi hai
 His mind is more rooted in the heroic paintings of the past, the impressive natural environments, the romantic innards
 prem or soundarya ke chithran main unhone sarvaadhik manoyog se kaam liya he
 Another feature, which often remains untargeted, is that they gave personality to the characters in the story
 vyaktinishthata chhayavaadi kavy kii visheshta rahi he
 He also gave first person to the characters of the plays
 vahi baat kahani ko sambandh main bhi kahi ja sakati he
 The creation of a person character like Babu Nanhook Singh of 'gunda' is alone in uniqueness
 is prakaar madhulika, champa, salvati aadi bhi avismaraneey hai
 National consciousness is a feature of cinematic poetry
 ise 'puraskaar' jaisi kahaniyon main dekha ja saktaa he
 The deep inner core of the mind is the foundation of his story
 'akashadip' iskaa jeevant udhaaharan he
 All the elements of lyricism - for the sake of solitary affliction, monotony, etc
 are known visasati
 ek alag drashtikon apnaane ke kaaran unki kahaniyaan premchand kii kahaniyon se bhinn ho jaati hai
 Islio critics consider the stories of the Prasad Sanstha as distinct from the premchand-sansthan stories
 drushtikon kaa algaav sanrachana kaa algaav hota he
 His plot has fewer incidents and more reactions to situations
 falswaroop unamem naatakeeyata kaa praadhanya ho gaya he
 His character also goes through situations and establishes his personality by his actions 
 prakritik setting jahaan kahin bhi le ai gai he vah sampurna kahani kaa anivaary ang ban gai he
 Like Chhayavadi poetry, he too appears to be accused of human consciousness
 anubhuti or kalpana kaa itnaa ekthan sanyog anyatra nahin milegaa
 Premchand turned the stories from micro-life to macro-life
 prasad kii kahaniyon chhayavaadi kavy-chetana ke itane sameep he ki ve swayan pragitatmak ho gai hai
 The duality of mixed emotions in them is mainly poetic and personal, so the flow of normal life will not be found there
 premchand ne kahaniyon par ladi hui alankarita ko anlankrita kar unhen sahaj banaaya
 Thus a second separation appears in the early stories of Premchand
 ise saamanyat: adarshavaad ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 But he should call it reformism
 bade ghar kii beti kaa badppan, bal-vivaah kaa virodh, vidhwaa-vivaah kaa samarthan sudhaarwad ke antargat hi aata he
 But respectively they changed and they tried their best to assess the real Indian life
 is desh ke madhyavargeey samaaj ko itane vaividhya ke saath kahaniyon main chitrit karne kaa praytn kisi anya vyakti ne nahin kiya
 He has also written many stories in number - two hundred twenty four
 kuch hi kahaniyaan likhane ke baad praaia: kahanikar apane ko duhraane lagate hai kintu premchand ne apane ko duharaaya nahin he
 This is an indicator of their vision
 gharelu jivan kii samasyaon tathaa saamaajik jivan kii vidmbanaaon ko jis dhang se unhone chitrit kiya he ve bahut jatil to nahin par taatkaaleen pariwaron or sansthaaon ko ujagar karne main purnat: samarth hai
 His idyllic and uncultured narrative style is more in tune with the Indian narrative
 par baad main chalakar premchand ne anubhav kiya ki unke adarsh jivan main faleebhoot nahin hue
 So, leaving behind the imaginative ideal, he began to depict the pitfalls of real life
 'pus kii raat' or 'kafan' main unke badale hue drushtikon tathaa nai sanrachana ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Both these stories, especially the final story, can be called completely modern
 ye kahaniyaan kisi adarsh kii khunti par nahin tangi hai
 In these, the critic cannot tell that the story is a particular object
 ve apana sampreshy swayan hai-aadi se ant tak
 There is no culmination, there is no climax
 keval sanketikta he, pathakon kii kaalpana ko udaan bharne kii chhot he
 The linguistic process discussed in today's criticism can be seen at full height in them
 donon hi kahaniyaan anveshan kii prakriya kaa sundar namoona hai
 It is surprising to see that the clown whose clown is being seen in today's life is present in the 'shroud'
 kintu is vidooshakatv ko unhone rachanaatmak sandarbh main rakhaa he jo samooche samaaj ko nanga karte hue ek arthpurna moolyadrushti ko sankethik karata he
 As a result of a historical association, the loneliness and dehumanization of modern life has become ingrained in the same way
 yah hindi kii pehali aadhuniktaa bodh kii kahani he
 No sequence of development is targeted among the writers who became Prasad and Premchand Institute
 unki kahaniyon main apane swatantra vyaktitv kii jhalak praaia nahin milti
 Rayakrishnadas Prasad is the author of the institute
 chandiprasad hridayesh main prasad kii kaavyatmakataa nahin he, unki alankruti maatr he
 The authors of the Premchand Institute enumerate Sudarshan, Vishwambharnath Kaushik, Raja Radhikramprasad Singh, Bhagwati Prasad Vajpayee, etc
 san 1922 i main ugr kaa hindi-katha-sahitya main pravesh hota he
 Furious was neither romantic like Prasad nor idealistic realist like Premchand
 ve keval yathartwaadee the – prakruti se hi unhone samaaj ke nange yatharth ko shashakt bhashaa-style main ujagar kiya
 He was severely criticized by so-called purist critics for exposing the filth of society
 unke sahitya ko ghaslati sahitya kaha gaya
 He attacked the social ugly
 dojakh kii aag, chingaariyaan, balaatkaar, sanakee amir, chocolate, indradhanush aadi unki suprasiddh kahaniyaan hai
 These stories have been described as indecorous and tragic
 lekin yadi unki bahut si kahaniyaan amaryadit hai to aaj ke lekhakon kii anek kahaniyon ke sambandh main bhi yahi kahana hoga
 One pattern cannot be applied for the stories of extremists and another for today's similar stories
 aaj ke sandarbh main ugr kii kahaniyon par punarvichaar karne kii zarurat he
 The influence of Ugri can be seen on Chatursen Shastri, Rishabhacharan Jain etc
 27-28 i main jainendra ne kahani likhnaa aarambh kiya
 His first story was published in the game Vishal Bharat
 phaansi vaatayan neelam desh kii rajakanya, ek raat, do chidiyaan, paajeb, jaisandhi aadi unke kahani sangrah hai
 With his arrival, a new rise of Hindi-story begins
 nae utthan kaa matlab manovaigyanik kahaniyaan kehane se spasht nahin hota
 People create confusion by calling them Sharad Chandra of Hindi
 janendra main sharadchandra kii ruaansi bhavukta nahin he
 There is an exploration of a specific type of life-philosophy in Jainendra's stories
 prasad kii kahaniyon main bhi man kaa gaharaa dwandv chitrit hua he
 But the dimensions of this duality are limited
 jainendra man kii paraten ughaadte hai or uske madhyam se satyanveshan kaa prayaas karte hai
 This attempt at truth-telling through stories first appears in the stories of Janendra
 jainendra kaa kahana he – kahani to ek bhukh he jo nirantar samaadhaan paane kii koshish karti he
 We have our own questions, doubts, concerns and we keep trying to find answers, solutions
 hamaare prayog hote rahete hai
 



 is anveshan kii prakriya gandhivaadi ahimsa or frydwadi achetan man ke vyapaar se sambandh he
 Therefore, the question of moral values arises from place to place
 par jainendra main ek prakaar ke rahasy or guhyata ke bhi darshan hote hai
 This is both his specialty and weakness
 aage chalakar jahaan unka darshan shithil or anveshanheen ho gaya he bahaan uskaa tevar adhik sthool auki chatakila he
 Later stories have similar postures
 unki kahaniyon kii sanrachana vyakti ke bindu se shuru hoti he
 Some kicks of the subconscious mind are bounced
 ve kabhi apni hi kisi duusari pravriti athwa bahya naitikta se takaraati hai
 This clash turns into a story of self-aggression and ego separation
 unamem praaia taarkik anviti kaa abhaav miltaa he or uski purti ve tarkatit rahasy se karte hai
 For the next few days, the development of Premchand and Jainendra's traditions is considered to be the development of Hindi-story
 yashpal mulat premchand kii parampara ke kahanikar hai
 The Progressive Writers Association was established in '36
 is samay ke lekhakon kii rachanaaon main pragatishiltaa ke tatva kaa jo samavesh hua use yugdharm samajhnaa chahie
 Yashpal was an active revolutionary activist of the national struggle
 isaliye sahitya ke ve saadhan samajhate the, saadhy nahin
 It is clear that his stories have been written to fulfill some purpose
 premchand dhan ke dushman the to yashpal dhani ke
 The rich are the lepers of our society
 sari saanskrithik – naitik asangatiyon ke mul main dhan kii vishmata hi kriyasheel he
 Along with Marx, Freud also has a profound influence on them
 falat yon-chetana ke khule chitra bhi inke kahani upanyaason main milenge
 Dozens of his stories have been published - the flight of the cage, the world, the gift of knowledge, the curse, the storm of logic, the chinagiri, the ashes of flowers, the kurtas of flowers, the mother of Uttami, etc
 yashpal kii kahaniyon ko drushtaant ke rup main grahan karte hai
 Therefore their stories are employed a lot
 is niyojan kaa mukhya aadhaar kalpana he – anubhuti nahin
 His composition is very similar to Premchand's composition
 premchand kii kahaniyon main pehle koi sthir vichaar aata he or baad main uske anusaar kahani ke paatr, sthitiyaan ghatnaayen aadi ko anveshit kar liya jaataa he
 Yashpal's process is no different
 premchand main sudhaarwad kii pramukhataa he to yashpal main marxvad or frydwad kii
 They are storytellers of ideas, not thoughts
 saamaajik visheshtaon or madhyavargeey samaaj ke khokhalepan par gaharaa vyang karne main ye bejod hai
 The biggest feature of Yashpal is that the story's juice is found everywhere in him
 agyeya prayogdharma kalakaar hai
 With his arrival, the story turned towards a new direction
 jis aadhuniktaa bodh kii aaj bahut charchaa kii jaati he uske pratham puraskarta agyeya hi thaharte hai- kavy main bhi, katha-sahitya main bhi
 Apart from being experimental, they are also conscious of their ethnic rites
 unki aarambhik kahaniyon main romani vidroh dikhaai padataa he
 But they kept moving away from romance
 ahan ke visarjan kaa ullekh ve baar baar karte hai, yah romance se alag hone kaa praytn hi he
 His ego has not interfered in his best stories
 isaliye ve apni sanshlishtataa main apurv ban padi he
 His story collections are Vipagatha, tradition, Kothari ki Baat, Refugee, Jaidol and Yeh Tere Pratap
 pehle donon sangrahon kii kahaniyon main ahan kaa visphot or romani vidroh he
 The stories of the refugee have not become creative due to being driven by intellectual sympathy
 par jaydol sangrah kii kahaniyaan apana vishisht sthaan rakhti hai
 Ego is fully immersed in most of the stories in this collection
 apane se hat kar uski drushti main samagrata or rachana main sanshlishtataa aa gai he
 Two of his stories can be seen, for example
 'gangrene' main madhyavarg kii ekresata ko samagrat liya gaya he
 This monotony will be found at its structural level
 use parinti yaa nichod ke rup main nahin paaya ja saktaa he - use paane ke liye kahani ko samagrat hi lenaa hoga
 'gangrene' is a tremendous symbol of the monotony of middle class life
 par ise parivesh, flash back, bimb, pratik ke madhyam se rachaa gaya he
 Neither surplus words nor a lot of adjectives like early stories
 gharelu vaataavaran, teen kaa gajar, ghante kaa ton-ton, pipe kaa tap-tap aadi sabhi kuch ekares parivesh kii rachana karte hai
 The 'endurance of the plateau' has also become important due to its creative synthesis and sense of modernity
 do yugon kii prem-kahaniyaan jo apana alag alag bodh detii hai, ek aantarik sangati main bandhakar parabul ke nikat pahunch jaati hai
 Ashk Premchand is the storyteller of the tradition
 unhone bhi madhyavargeey samaaj se kathavstu kaa chayan kiya he
 Various story related experiments will be found in his work
 par prayogdharmi rachanaaon main ek prakaar kii ayasajnya kritrimata milti he
 a deep feeling of life is available in stories like Dachi, Kakdaan ka Teli
 ashk ke atirikt vrundavanlaal verma, bhagwaticharan verma, ilachandra joshi, amritlal nagar aadi upanyaaskaaron ne bhi kahaniyon ke kshetra main kaam kiya he
 But their real field is a novel, not a story
 iske baad san 50 i ke aasapaas se hindi kahaniyaan nae daur se guzarane lagati hai
 It is difficult to give a name to the trend of stories developed in these two decades
 yadi koi naam diya ja saktaa he to vah he aadhuniktaa bodh kii kahaniyaan
 Stories of complex-life-realism grounded in modernity, the mechanics of science and technology
 paramparaagat hindi kahaniyon se algane ke liye inhen nai nai kahaniyaan kaha jane laga
 Actually new stories were named after the new poem
 kuch log in kahaniyon ko purvavarti peedi kii kahaniyon kaa vikaas maanate hai or kuch parampara se katkar yaa use asweekaar kar ise ekadam nai kehane kii hathdharmi se baj nahin aate
 Actually, there is nothing meaningful in these names
 nai kahani se bhi apane ko algane ke liye or or naam rakhe gayi- sachetan kahani, akahani aadi
 But arguing over names is meaningless
 kahani to kahani he
 With the change of age, his tendencies will change
 swatantraaa – prapti ke kuch hi varshon baad bhartiya parivesh main prasannataa – avsaad ke virdohi swar sunai padane lage
 Some people were hopeful of fulfilling national aspirations and some people were disillusioned
 swatantraaa kii prapti ek romentic ghatana thi
 Romantic reality is depicted in the village and its associated stories
 shivaprasad singh, markendeya or fanishwarnath renu kii kahaniyon ko isi koti main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Jeevat is also found in some of his stories
 kintu is tarah kii adhikansh kahaniyaan, jane-samajhe or aanshik rup se bhoge yatharth par aadhaarit hone par bhi, puraane mulyon kaa hi pratipaadan karti hai
 In these two decades, faith in Dada, Baba, Mai was reversed and portrayed as a struggle of old and new values
 yah takaraahat nae badlaav kii soochna detii he
 Something has been broken in modern life that all the old relationships have changed
 ragapurn sambandh apane tanaavon main moolyaheen hone ke saath arthhin bhi ho gayi hai
 Mohan Rakesh has expressed these tensions mainly in his stories
 kamaleshwar tanaavon ke bich mulya drushti kii talash karte hai
 Nirmal Verma, while being romantically, effectively portrays today's social irony - meaningless scream - in some stories
 dharmaveer bharti, raghuveer sahay or naresh mehta kavi pehle hai or kahanikar baad main
 Among these, Bharti's personality is the most innate ability and value
 unki kahaniyon par unka kavi vyaktitv kahin haaavee nahin hota
 As soon as possible, he provides help
 is sangrah main sangrahit ‘gulki banno’ iskaa pramaan he
 Rajendra Yadav, Mannu Bhandari, Usha Priyamvada, Krishna Sobti, Srikanth Verma, Krishna Baldev Vaid, Rajkamal Chaudhary are the storytellers of the same tensions
 ye tanaav, pati-patni, pita-putr, bhai-bahan, premi-premika sabhi main dikhaai padenge
 a deep gap has been created between the individual and society
 tanaavon ke bich rahane vaale vyakti apane ko akele, ajanabi or santrast paa rahe hai
 This is not the condition of intellectuals of this country
 anya deshon ke log bhi il sthiti kaa or bhi tikhepan ke saath anubhav kar rahe hai
 The whole life has become so complicated and mechanical that humans have become mechanical
 uski apni pahchaan gum ho gai he
 The situation has deteriorated to the point that life means to him that he is meaningless
 ek or peedi
 That is, the works of Gyanranjan, Dudhanath Singh, Vijaymohan Singh, Ravindra Kalia, Mahendra Bhalla etc
 are the form of modernity in their stories that express boredom, suffocation, futility etc
 ye kahanikar praayah traasad maanviya sthitiyon se ubar nahin pate
 Among these storytellers, Gyanranjan's vision is able to capture the most balanced, non-romantic and new experiences
 agle daur ke kahanikaron kii suchi lambii he-kashinath singh, ibrahim sharif, israel, vishveshwar, sudhaa aroda aadi
 Kashinath Singh and Ibrahim Sharif have moved away from modernity and tried to find the right path in the anomalies of life
 arthhin jivan ko arth dene kii yah prakriya swasth pravriti kii suchak he

 isamen vibhinn boliyon ke shabdon ko dhvanyatmak pratilekhan main sangruhit kar unki sanketasima spasht kii jaati he
 The distinction between language and dialect is determined by "mutual intelligibility"
 is bodhgamyata ke chaar str hote hai - Full comprehension, incomplete comprehension, partial comprehension, zero comprehensibility bodhgamyata ke inhen staron ke aadhaar par vyaktiboli, upboli, boli tathaa bhashaa kii pruthak kotiyaan vargeekrut hoti hai
 Complete intelligibility indicates a similar eloquence of individuals living in a dialect area
 varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan kii aadhuniktam manyata yah he ki prayek vyakti kii vakpravriti purnataya samaan nahin hoti
 But this inequality is not so gross that they cannot understand each other
 is prakaar vyaktigat vakpravritiyon kaa samanvit rup vyaktiboli he or vyaktiboliyon kaa samanvit rup upboli tathaa upboliyon kaa samanvit rup boli he
 Similarly language is the coordinated unit of dialects
 uparyukt dharna se yah spasht he ki vyakti boli or bhashaa ke bich bodhgamyata ke hi vividh str sakriy hote hai
 Language studies are mostly considered up to the level of sub-language but individual dialects are also important in terms of dialect
 bhashiya str par vyaktiboli evam upboli kaa ek yugma hota he or boli tathaa bhashaa kaa doosraa
 Just as it is easy to understand each other in the language and border areas of languages or languages, even though they are distinguishable, the same or even more comprehensibility lies at the boundaries of dialect or sub-language
 simavarti kshetron main pai janevaali aisi bodhgamyata ke kaaran hi bhashaa or boli yaa boli yaa upboli ke bich koi spasht vibhaajak rekha nahin khinchi ja sakati
 Bloomfield has called the study of local distinctions in a linguistic field a dialect of geography and also complements the achievements of the comparative genre
 boliyon ke adhyayan ko boli atlas ke rup main prastut karnaa sarvaadhik prachlit he
 These atlas of the dialect area are collections of maps on which linguistic features are represented through homogeneous lines based on local distribution

 Only penetrating forms are displayed
 isiilie kitne hi log boli vyakaran, boliyon kaa simanirdhaaran, koshsankalan or tulanaatmak, aitihaasik nishkarshon ko hi boli vigyaan kaa saadhy maanate hai
 The atlases are considered to be related to language geography and separate it from dialectology
 samroop rekhaon dwaara vibhakt kshetra teen hote hai : Remnant areas: The areas where the inhabitants are economically underdeveloped and where the geographical location is such that it is difficult to access easily, the earliest forms can be found in those areas
 duusare log in sthanon ke roopon ko praaia: hey maanate hai

 Therefore, the tilt of homogeneous lines is also centripetal

 Forms of the remnant area are considered to be the oldest of all, and transition zone forms indicate that a new form is taking precedence over a behavioral old form

 Duliajan was an area surrounded by dense forests 100-150 years ago
 Here the Dihing forest used to be on both sides of the river Dihing
 The Ahom king, who was also called Swargadev, was a dear hunter

 swaraj kaa shabdic arth he - ‘swashaasan’ yaa "apana rajya" 
 This word used during the national movement of India emphasized the demand for self-determination and independence
 praarambhik rashtravaadiyon ne swadhinata ko doorgaami lakshya maanate hue ‘swashaasan’ ke sthaan par ‘acchhee sarkaar’ ke lakshya ko variyata di
 Then the term became popular during the militant era, when Bal Gangadhar Tilak announced that "swaraj is my birthright and i will keep it
" ’’ gandhi ne sarvapratham 1920 main kaha ki ‘‘meraa swaraj bharat ke liye sansadeey shashan kii maang he, jo vayask matadhikaar par aadhaarit hoga
 Gandhi's view was that Swaraj means such a system run by the people's representatives, which is in accordance with the needs and wishes of the people
 ’’ vastut: gandhiji kaa swaraj kaa vichaar britain ke rajnatik, saamaajik, aarthik, beurocratic, kanoonee, sainik evam shaikshanik sansthaaon kaa bahishkaar karne kaa aandolan tha

 Gandhi wanted to end the current political structure based on violence and exploitation, replacing it with a system that is based on the consent of the individual and which aims to contribute to public welfare in non-violent ways
 gandhi ke anusaar ahimsaatmak samaaj rajyaviheen hoga
 He opposes the state on the basis that it is neither a natural institution nor necessary

 gandhi kaa mat tha ki rajyaviheen tathaa vargvihin ahimsak samaaj kii sthapana kaa lakshya sahaj rup se praapt nahin hoga
 So it is okay to end the state immediately
 faltah unka lakshya rajya ko ahimsa ke siddhanto ke anuroop dhaalnaa he
 There will be a type of government and political power to regulate social behavior in a non-violent state, but it will rule at least, because social life will be self-regulating
 vyakti ko purna swatantraaa praapt hogi
 Most of the work will be done by voluntary organizations
 gandhi ke ye vichaar rasel, ji0di0ech0 kol jaise gild samaajwaadiyon se milte-julate hai
 Gandhi's democratic society will be a socialist state
 bhagwat puraana se prabhavit hone ke kaaran unka mat tha ki - Gandhi is not in favor of the abolition of private property but wants to bring economic equality
 aarthik samanta se taatpary he-sabhi ke liye paryaapt va santulit bhojan, awaas tathaa tan dhakne ke liye khaadi
 Taking the side of Swadeshi, he emphasizes on the development of cottage and small scale industries and Khadi industries
 gandhi ne praudyogiki pradhan udyogon yaa mashiinon dwaara utpaadan kaa virodh kiya tathaa iske sthaan par shram pradhan udyogon ko variyata di
 According to him, production should be done by people and not by factories
 gandhi ne ‘shram-siddhant’’ ke antargat yah shiksha di ki prayek vyakti ko shaareerik shram karke apane upbhog kii vastuon main yogadan dena chahie
 Since each type of service or labor will be given the same respect, the dignity of labor will be established and the erasure of class distinction will establish a 'classless' society
 gandhi ne bhuswamiyon tathaa poonjipatiyon kii sampatti-adhigrahan kaa samarthan nahin kiya he
 Like Christian socialists, he wanted to achieve his goal of economic equality by changing the attitude of capitalists through love and persuasion
 poonjipati swayan ko sampatti kaa swami na samajhakar trustee yaa nyaasi samajhen
 They should consider the property they hold as the heritage of the society
 usamen se ve apane liye utana hi vyay karen, jinaki unki sevaaon ke liye upyukt he, shesh samaaj ko lotaa den arthath nirdhanon main baant den
 The goal of production should be the interest of the entire society through profit
 shramikon kii prabandh main bhagidaarita honi chahie
 If the capitalist does not accept to become a trustee, the state should by law control the land and other means of production
 saamaanya hit yaa sarv kalyaan kii drushti se gandhi ne sarvoday ke siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya he
 This principle supports such a policy, which aims to promote welfare work at all levels of society by eradicating discrimination of caste, creed, religion, women, men, high and low
 yah paraspar sahyog va sadbhaavna kaa vikaas karegaa
 The principle of Gandhi's Sarvodaya is the principle of the goal of the state
 upyogetavaadi chintak bantham tathaa je
es
 mil jahaan ‘‘adhiktam logon ke adhiktam kalyaan’’ ke paksh main the, vahiin jon raskin ne ‘‘sabase antim yaa upekshit alpsankhyak’’ kaa paksh liya
 Gandhi, by combining these two principles, propounded a new theory, called Sarvodaya or the principle of "upliftment or welfare of all the people of society"
 baad main vinoba bhaave ne isi siddhant kaa anusaran kiya
 Gandhi was neither a political thinker nor a theory builder in the traditional sense, but he was a pioneer and superior social reformer of the Indian independence movement
 ek ore satya or ahimsa ke aadhaar par unhone asahyog, savinay avagya tathaa bharat chodo aandolan kaa netritv kiya, duusari ore jatvaad, sampradayikta tathaa chuaa-chhot ke viruddh abhiyaan chalaaya
 Unlike Machiavelli, he established a relationship between politics and morality by means and means
 paashchaatya udaarvaadiyon kii tarah unhone vyaktigat swatantraaa tathaa pratinidhiatmak prajatantr main vishwaas jataayaa
 The concept of Sarvodaya is important as the objective of the state
 karmyogi hone ke naate gandhi shram kii garima me vishwaas rakhte the
 Gandhi's vision of a classless and stateless society seems impractical
 swayan gandhi bhi ise sweekaar karte hai
 But the importance of decentralization, rural autonomous system and ideas related to employment, Swadeshi etc
 in their political and economic field cannot be denied
 unke satyagrah, swaraj tathaa sarvoday ke siddhanton kaa raajnneetik darshan main mahatvapurn yogadan he

 Along with the poetry, prose also developed and a new revolution occurred in the world of literature as soon as the printing office came
 aadhunik hindi gadhy kaa vikaas keval hindi bhashi kshetron tak hi simit nahin rahaa
 The popularity of Hindi spread throughout the country and in every state, and many other linguistic writers contributed significantly to its development by writing literature in Hindi
 chitralekha na keval bhagwaticharan verma ko ek upanyaaskaar ke rup main pratishtha dilaane vaala pehla upanyaas he balki hindi ke un virale upanyaason main bhi gananeey he, jinaki lokapriyata baraabar kaal kii seemaa ko laanghati rahi he
 Chitralekha's story is based on the problem of sin and virtue - what is sin? Where does he reside ? To find the answer to these questions, two disciples of Mahaprabhu Ratnamabar, Shwetank and Vishaladeva go to the shelter of Samanta Bijagupta and Yogi Kumaragiri respectively
 or unke nishkarshon par mahaprabhu ratnambar kii tippanee he, ‘‘sansar main paap kuch bhi nahin he, yah keval manushya ke drushtikon kii vishmata kaa doosraa naam he
 We neither sin nor do virtue, we only do what we have to do

 According to this epic, Draupadi is the daughter of King Drupada of Panchal country who later became the wife of the five Pandavas
 draupadi panch-kanyaon main se ek hai jinhen chir-kumari kaha jaataa he
 It is also famous by other names like Krishna, Yagyaseni, Mahabharati, Sairandhri etc
 draupadi kaa vivaah paanchon pandav bhaiyon se hua tha
 The five sons born to them by the Pandavas were known as up-pandavas
 pracheen bharat ke mahakavy mahabharat ke anusaar draupadi kaa janm maharaj drupad ke yahan yajyakund se hua tha
 Therefore, it was also called 'yagyaseni'
 draupadi purvajanm main kisi rishi kii kanya thi
 She did penance with the desire to get a husband
 shankar ne prasann hokar use var dene kii ichha kii
 She told Shankar five times that she wanted an all-encompassing husband
 shankar ne kaha ki agle janm main uske paanch bharatvanshi pati honge, kyonki usne pati paane kii kaamana paanch baar dohraayi thi
 When the education of Pandava and Kaurava princes was completed, they wanted to give Guru Dakshina to Dronacharya
 dronacharya ko drupad ke dwaara kiye gayi apane apmaan kaa samaran ho aayaa or unhone rajkumaron se kaha, "rajkumaron! yadi tum gurudakshina dena hi chaahate ho to paanchal naresh drupad ko bandi bana kar mere samaksh prastut karo
 This will be your Gurudakshina
 " gurudev ke is prakaar kehane par samast rajkumaar apane-apane astr-shastr le kar paanchal desh kii ore chale
 On reaching Panchal, Arjuna said to Dronacharya, "gurudev! You first allow the Kauravas to fight with King Drupada
 yadi ve drupad ko bandi banane main asafal rahe to ham pandav yuddh karenge
 "on getting the permission of the Guru, the Kauravas led by Duryodhana attacked Panchal
 donon pakshon ke madhya bhayankar yuddh hone laga kintu ant main kaurav parrast ho kar bhaag nikle
 Seeing the Kauravas fleeing, the Pandavas started the attack
 bhimsen tathaa arjuna ke parakram ke samaksh paanchal naresh kii sena haar gai
 Arjuna went ahead and made Drupada a prisoner and brought it to Guru Dronacharya
 drupad ko bandi ke rup main dekh kar dronacharya ne kaha, "he drupad! ab tumhaare rajya kaa swami main ho gaya hoon
 i came to you as a friend, but you did not accept me as your friend
 ab bataao kya tum meri mitrataa sweekaar karte ho?" drupad ne lajja se sir jhukaa liya or apni bhul ke liye kshamayachna karte huye bole, "he dron! aapako apana mitra na maananaa meri bhul thi or uske liye ab mere hriday main pashchaatap he
 Both i and my kingdom are now subject to you, now do whatever you wish
 " dronacharya ne kaha, "tumne kaha tha ki mitrataa samaan varg ke logon main hoti he
 Therefore, i am returning half of your kingdom to you in order to maintain a friendly spirit with you
 " itnaa kah kar dronacharya ne ganga nadi ke dakshini tat kaa rajya drupad ko saunp diya or shesh ko swayan rakh liya
 After being defeated by Guru Drona, Maharaj Drupada was extremely ashamed and started thinking of a way to let him down in some way
 isi chintaa main ek baar ve ghoomte huye kalyani nagari ke brahmanon kii basti main ja pahunche
 There he met the great Karmakandi Brahmin brothers named Yaz and Upayaj
 raja drupad ne unki seva karke unhen prasann kar liya evam unase dronacharya ke maarane kaa upaay poocha
 On his asking, elder brother Yaj said, "for this you please Agnidev by organizing a huge yajna so that he will give you the gift of that great powerful son
 " maharaj ne yaaj or upyaaj se unke kahe anusaar yajna karavaaya
 Pleased with his sacrifice, Agnidev gave him a son who was full of weapons and armor
 uske pashchaat us yajna kund se ek kanya utpann hui jiske netra khile huye camel ke samaan dedeepyaman the, bhauhen chandramaa ke samaan vakr thim tathaa uskaa varna shyaamal tha
 As soon as she was born, there was an All India Radio that this girl was born for the destruction of the Kshatriyas and the destruction of the Kauravas
 balak kaa naam dhridhyumna evam balika kaa naam krishna rakhaa gaya
 "I am coming from Panchal, the city of Maharaj Drupada
 vahaan par drupad kii kanya draupadi ke swayamvar ke liye anek deshon ke raja-maharaja padhaare huye hai
 " vedavyas-tum log paanchal chale jaao
 There Drupada is going to be the swayamvara of Virgo Panchali

 That devaswarpa girl is worthy of you all the same
 tum log vahaan ja kar use praapt karo
 The king-maharaja and Prince of many countries were present in the Swayamvara Sabha, soon after, Princess Draupadi arrived in that meeting with her brother Dhrishtadyumna in hand
 dhridhyumna ne sabha ko sambodhit karte huye kaha, "vibhinn desh se padhaare raja-maharaajaaon evam anya ganmaanya jano se meri bahan draupadi kaa vivaah hoga
 " ek ke baad ek sabhi raja-maharaja evam rajkumaron ne ek upar gumti hui machhlee kii aankh pra uske pratibimb ko neeche jal main dekhakar nishaanaa saadhane kaa prayaas kiya kintu safalataa haath na lagi or ve kantiheen hokar apane sthaan main laut aaye
 These unsuccessful people included Jarasandha, Shalya, Shishupala and Duryodhana, Kauravas etc
 kauravon ke asafal hone par karn ne nishaanaa saadhane ke liye jaise hi dhanush uthaaya ,tabhi draupadi ne shri krishna ke ishaare par karn ko sut putr kahkar vivaah ke liye manaa kar diya 
 Then the princess wanted to receive a Brahmin on the orders of Shri Krishna
 arjuna ne tailpaatr main pratibimb ko dekhte huye ek hi baan se nishaanaa laga daalaa
 Draupadi went ahead and put varmala on Arjun's neck
 ek brahman ke gale main draupadi ko varmala daalate dekh samast kshatriya raja-maharaja evam rajkumaron ne krodhit ho kar arjuna par akraman kar diya
 a fierce battle ensued between the Pandavas and the Kshatriya kings
 pandav draupadi ko saath le kar vahaan pahunche jahaan ve apni mata kunti ke saath nivas kar rahe the
 Arjun called out from the gate and said to his mother, "mother! Today we have come with a wonderful begging for you
 " us par kunti ne bheetar se hi kaha, "putron! tum log aapas main mil-baant uskaa upbhog kar lo
 "later on knowing that the beggar was in the form of a bride, Kunti was deeply repentant but Draupadi accepted the five Pandavas as her husband to prove the mother's words to be true
 pandavon ke draupadi ko saath le kar apane nivas par pahunchne ke kuch kaal pashchaat unke peeche-peeche krishna bhi vahaan par aa pahunche
 After the formalities were completed, Kunti said to Draupadi, "draupadi! First take out the parts of the gods
 phir brahmanon ko do
 Then separate the fraction of dependents
 uske baad jo shesh bache uskaa aadha bhaag bhim ko or shesh aadha bhaag ham sabhi ko apni deh paroso

 Rama is the seventh incarnation of Vishnu in the ten incarnations of Hinduism
 ram kaa jeevankaal evam parakram maharishi valmiki dwaara rachit sanskrit mahakavy ramayana ke rup main varnit hua he
 Goswami Tulsidas also composed the devotional well-known epic Sri Ramcharitmanas centered on his life
 in donon ke atirikt anya bhartiya bhashaaon main bhi ramayana kii rachanaaen hui hai, jo kaaphi prasiddh bhi hai
 Ram is highly revered and an ideal man, especially in North India
 inhen purushottam shabd se bhi alankrita kiya jaataa he
 Rama was the eldest son of King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya of Ayodhya
 ram kii patni kaa naam sita tha or inke teen bhai the- lakshmana, bharat or shatrughna
 Hanuman is considered to be the biggest devotee of Lord Rama

 Rama has a reputation as Maryada Purushottam
 ram ne maryaada ke paalan ke liye rajya, mitra, mata-pita, yahan tak ki patni kaa bhi saath choda
 His family represents the ideal Indian family
 ram raghukul main janme the, jisaki parampara praan jaahun baru bachanu na jaai kii thi
 Sri Ram's father Dasharatha had pledged his step-mother Kaikeyi to fulfill any of his two wishes
 kaikeyi ne daasi manthra ke bahekaave main aakar in varon ke rup main raja dasharath se apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajsinghaasana or ram ke liye chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas maanga
 Rama happily accepted fourteen years of exile to protect his father's word
 patni sita ne adarsh patni kaa udhaaharan dete hue pati ke saath van janaa uchit samajha
 Bhai Laxman also spent fourteen years in the forest with Rama

 Then put it on the throne and ruled it

 Many festivals of Hinduism, such as Dussehra, Ram Navami and Deepawali, are associated with the life story of Rama
 'ram' dhaatu main 'ghan' pratyay ke yoga se 'ram' shabd nishpann hota he
 The meaning of 'rama' metal is related to Raman
 ve pranimaatr ke hriday main 'raman' karte hai, isliye 'ram' hai tathaa bhaktajan unamem 'raman' karte hai, isliye bhi ve 'ram' hai
 In his commentary on 'vishnusahsrnama', Adya Shankaracharya has quoted Padmapuran saying that Yogijans do Ramana in God, so they are 'rama'
 vaidic sahitya main 'ram' kaa ullekh prachlit rup main nahin miltaa he
 The word 'rama' is used only at two places in the Rigveda
 unamem se bhi ek jagah kaale rang ke arth main tathaa shesh ek jagah hi vyakti ke arth main prayog hua he; lekin vahaan bhi unke avtari purush yaa dasharath-putr hone kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Although Neelkanth Chaturdhar has chosen many of the mantras of the Rigveda in his own discretion, he has his own Ramakathapak meaning, but this is his personal belief
 swayan rugveda ke un prakarnon main praapt kisi sanket yaa kisi anya bhashyakaar ke dwaara un mantron kaa ramakthaparak arth siddh nahin ho paaya he
 In the Rigveda, 'ikshvakuh' is used at one place and the word 'dasharatha' is also used at one place
 parantu unke ram se sambaddh hone kaa koi sanket nahin mil paata he
 The word 'rama' is used in Brahmin literature at two sites in Aitareya Brahmana; But there he is called 'ramo Margaveyaah', which according to Acharya Sayan is the son of a woman named 'mrigavu'
 shatapath brahman main ek sthal par 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 Here 'rama' is as the Acharya of Yajna and he is called 'rama Aupatapasvini'
 taatpary yah ki prachlit ram kaa avtari rup valmikiy ramayana evam puraanon kii hi dein he
 The following description is available in relation to the birth of Rama in the most authentic scripture Adikavya Valmiki Ramayana related to Ramakatha: xxrep 22 
 chaitre navamike tithu
 
 nakshatreditidaivatye swocchsanstheshu panchasu
 Bhreeshu karkte lagne vakpavatinduna co
 
 That is, in the Navami Tithi of Chaitra month, in Punarvasu Nakshatra, when the five planets are in their high position and the position of Jupiter with the Moon in Cancer Ascendant
 yahan keval brihaspati tathaa chandramaa kii sthiti spasht hoti he
 Jupiter is exalted and the moon is self-possessed
 aage pandrahaven shloke main surya ke ucch hone kaa ullekh he
 In this way, Jupiter and Sun are known to be high
 budh hameshaa surya ke paas hi rahata he
 Therefore, it is impossible for Buddha to be high when the Sun is high
 is prakaar ucch hone ke liye bachate hai shesh teen grah -- mangal, shukr tathaa shani
 For this reason, almost all scholars have considered the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn to be high in the time of Rama's birth
 paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm treta yug main mana jaataa he
 According to the data available in Hindu theology, especially in mythological literature, a Chaturyugi has 43,20,000 years, of which Kaliyuga has 4,32,000 years and Dwapara 8,64,000 years
 ram kaa janm treta yug main arthath dwapar se pehle hua tha
 Since Kali Yuga has just begun and Rama was born at the end of Treta and the time of his present living on earth with an avatar has traditionally been considered as 11,000 years
 atah dwapar yug ke 8,64,000 varsh + ram kii vartmaanta ke 11,000 varsh + dwapar yug ke ant se abtak beete 5,100 varsh = kul 8,80,100 varsh
 Hence traditionally Rama's birth is considered to be about 8,80,100 years ago
 prakhyat marathi shodhakarta vidwaan dow0 padmakar vishnu vartak ne ek drushti se is samay ko sambhavya mana he
 They say that the height of Vindhyachal and Himalayas at one place in the Valmiki Ramayana is said to be the same
 vindhyachal kii oonchaai 5,000 feet he tathaa yah praayah sthir he, jabaki himalay kii oonchaai vartmaan main 29,029 feet he tathaa yah nirantar vardhansheel he
 The height difference between the two is 24,029 feet
 visheshgyon kii manyata ke anusaar himalay 100 varsho main 3 feet badhata he
 Therefore, it would have taken the Himalayas about 8,01,000 years to grow 24,029 feet
 atah abhi se kareeb 8,01,000 varsh pehle himalay kii oonchaai vindhyachal ke samaan rahi hogi, jiskaa ullekh valmikiy ramayana main vartmaankalik rup main hua he
 In this way Dr
 Vartak finds this time possible from a point of view, but he himself believes that he cannot confirm this time from any other source
 apane suvikhyath granth 'vastav ramayana' main dow0 vartak ne mukhyatah grahagatiyon ke aadhaar par ganit karke valmikiy ramayana main ullikhit grahasthiti ke anusaar ram kii vaastavik janm-tithi 4 disambar 7323 isapurv ko sunishchit kiya he
 According to him, Rama must have been born on this date between 1:30 to 3:00 pm
 dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak ke shodh ke anek varshon ke baad 'ai-sarv' ke ek shodh dal ne 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog karke shri ram kaa janm 10 janvari 5114 isapurv main siddh kiya
 He believed that the planets had the same position on this date as described in the Valmiki Ramayana
 parantu yah samay kaaphi sandehaaspad ho gaya he
 The 'planetarium Gold' software used by the research team of 'i-serve' is not really capable of doing true planetary mathematics before 3000 BC
 vastutah 2013 isvi se pehle itane pehle kaa grah-ganit karne hetu sakasham software uplabdh hi nahin tha
 Saturn was in Scorpio in the planetary position attained by this calculation, ie it was not in high
 chandramaa punarvasu nakshatra main na hokar pushya ke dwitiya charan main hi tha tathaa tithi bhi ashtami hi thi
 Later in the correct calculation done by ejplde431 software by another expert, the date becomes Navami but Saturn comes in Scorpio and in the fourth phase of Moon Pushya
 atah 10 janvari 5114 isapurv kii tithi vastutah shriram kii janm-tithi siddh nahin ho paati he
 In such a situation, if the date already refined by Dr
 p
v
vartak is certified by the software, then only the real time of Shri Ram will be able to be universally accepted or in case of not being certified, the path of research of new date will be opened
 puraanon main shri ram ke janm ke bare main spasht pramaan milte ki shri ram kaa janm vartmaan uttar pradesh ke faijabad jile ke ayodhya naamak nagar main hua tha
 Ayodhya which was the capital of Lord Rama's ancestors

 Rama was a brave man of quiet nature since childhood
 unhone maryaadaaon ko hameshaa sarvocch sthaan diya tha
 For this reason, he is known as Maryada Purushottam Rama
 unka rajya nyaaypriy or khushhaal mana jaataa tha
 So whenever there is talk of Suraj in India, the example of Ramraj or Ramrajya is given
 dharm ke maarg par chalane vaale ram ne apane teenon bhaaiyon ke saath guru vashishtha se shiksha praapt kii
 As a teenager, Guru Vishwamitra took him along to end the turmoil created by demons in the forest

 a demon named Tadka lived in Buxar
 vahiin par uskaa vadh hua
 Rama then killed a demon named Tadka and forced Maricha to flee
 is dauraan hi guru vishwamitra unhen mithila le gayi
 The Videha king Janak organized a swayamvar ceremony for the marriage of his daughter Sita
 jahaan bhagwaan shiv kaa ek dhanush tha jisaki pratyancha chadhaane vaale shoorveer se sita kaa vivaah kiya janaa tha
 Many kings Maharaja attended that ceremony
 jab bahut se raja praytn karne ke baad bhi dhanush par pratyancha chadhaanaa to dur use uthaa tak nahin sake, tab vishwamitra kii ajna paakar ram ne dhanush uthaa kar pratyancha chadhaane kaa praytn kiya
 In an attempt to raise his reputation, he broke down while uttering a great bow
 maharishi parashuram ne jab is ghor dhwani ko suna to ve vahaan aa gayi or apane guru kaa dhanush tutne par rosh vyakt karne lage
 Laxman was of a fierce nature

 Then Rama interrupted

 Ram Sita started living happily in Ayodhya

 He was particularly popular due to his soft-hearted, public-oriented spirit and justice
 raja dasharath vanprastha kii ore agrasar ho rahe the
 Hence, he thought of handing over the kingdom to Rama
 janata main bhi sukhad lahar daud gai kii unke priy raja unke priy rajkumaar ko raja niyukt karanevaale hai
 At that time Rama's other two brothers Bharata and Shatrughna had gone to their maternal aunt Kaikeya
 kaikeyi kii daasi manthra ne kaikeyi ko bharamaaya ki raja tumhaare saath galat kar rahen he
 If you are the beloved queen of the king then your child should become the king, but King Dasharatha wants Ram to be the king
 ram ke bachapan kii vistaar-purvak vivaran swami tulsidas kii ramcharitamanas ke balkand se milti he
 King Dasharatha had three queens: Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi
 ram kaushalya ke putr the, sumitra ke do putr, lakshmana or shatrughna the or kaikeyi ke putr bharat the
 With the state rules, only the eldest son of a king is eligible to become a king, so Rama was sure to become the king of Ayodhya
 kaikeyi jinhone do baar dasharath kii jaan bachaai thi or dasharath ne unhen yah var diya tha ki wo jivan ke kisi bhi pal unase do var maang sakati he
 Kaikeyi wanted Rama to be king as Raja becoming king and looking to the future, so he granted Rama 14 years of exile by King Dasharatha and demanded the kingdom of Ayodhya for his son Bharata
 vachanon main bande raja dasharath ko majabuuran yah sweekaar karnaa padaa
 Rama obeyed his father's orders
 ram kii patni sita or unke bhai lakshmana bhi vanvaas gayi the
 At the time of exile, Ravana killed Sita
 ravan ek rakshas tathaa lanka kaa raja tha
 According to the Ramayana, Sita got distraught after hearing the voice of a deer when Rama, Sita and Lakshmana were in the hut
 vah hiran ravan kaa mamaa marich tha
 He made a golden deer form at the behest of Ravana
 sita use dekh kar mohit ho gai or shriram se us hiran kaa shikaar karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Shri Ram started to fulfill his Indian desire and asked Lakshmana to protect Sita
