 Part of a category on Sikhism khalsa sikh dharm ke vidhiwat dikshaprapt anuyaayiyon samuhik rup he
 The Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh ji in Anandpur Sahib on the day of Baisakhi on 1699
 is din unhone sarvapratham paanch pyaaron ko amritpan karvaa kar khalsa banaaya tathaa tatpashchaat un paanch pyaaron ke haathon se swayan bhi amritpan kiya
 Satguru Gobind Singh has honored Khalsa with the status of "kaal Purakh ki Army" in Khalsa glory
 talwaar or kesh to pehle hi sikhon ke paas the, guru gobind singh ne "khande bate kii pahul" tayar kar kacha, kadaa or kangha bhi diya
 On the same day, "singh" was put behind the name of Khalse
 shaareerik dekh main khalse kii bhinta najar aane lagi
 But the Khalsa did not give up self-knowledge, his propaganda continued and the sword also continued when needed
 sikh dharm ke upar anya dharmon or sarkari numaayindo ke waar lagaataar bad gaye the
 By giving false news to the government, staunch followers of Islam got Guru Arjun Dev ji sentenced to death
 jab guru arjuna dev, ko bahut dukh de kar shahid kar diya gaya to guru hargobind ji ne talwaar uthaa lee
 This sword was raised only for self-defense and for the betterment of the general public
 guru hargobind ji ke jivan main un par lagaataar 4 hamale hue or satguru hari raae par bhi ek hamalaa hua
 Guru Hari Krishna also tried to make emperor Aurangzeb his follower
 guru teg bahadur ko sarkaar ne maut ke ghat utaar diya, kyonki wo hindu brahminon ke dukhon ko dekh kar sarkaar se apil karne gaye the
 After that, the government clergy started considering the increasing propaganda of Gurmat and the huge number of followers as a threat to their religion and they united against it
 is bich guru gobind singh ne kuch baniyon kii rachana kii jis main islam ke khilaaf sakht tippaniyan thi
 In view of the above circumstances and the oppressive behavior of Aurangzeb and his nominees towards the non-muslim people, when Guru Gobind Singh decided to wage an armed struggle to protect the religion, he looked for the Sikhs who pursue the Gurmat ideology, help the miseries
 Do and do not back down in the sacrifice of your sacrifice when you need it
 jab koi dharm aage badhata he to uske bahut aam dikhta he ki uske anuyaayi bahut hai, zyaadaatar to dekha-dekhi ho jate hai, kuch shardha main ho jate hai, kuch apane khudgarji ke kaaran ho jate hai, asal anuyaayi to hote hi gine chune hai
 Evidence of this was found in Anandpur
 jab satgur gobind singh ne talwaar nikal kar kaha kii ""unhen ek sir chaiye"" | sab hakke bakke rah gaye | kuch to maukey se hi khisak gaye | kuch kehane lag pade guru pagal ho gaya he | kuch tamaasha dekhne aae the | kuch mata gujri ke paas bhaag gaye kii dekho tumharaa saputra kya khichdi pakaa rahaa he | Bhai Daya Singh ji was the first hand in the crowd of 10 thousand
 Behind the Gurmat ideology, he had the ability to behead
 Guru Sahib took him to the tent
 There was a goat neck cut
 Blood appeared to come out of the tent
 Fear increased in public
 Even then, by showing snow, Dharam Singh, Himmat Singh, Mohkam Singh, Sahib Singh accepted to cut their sis
 Guru Sahib kept goatting
 paanchon ko phir tamboo se bahar niklaa or khande bate kii pahul tayar kii | Khanda Bata is composed of Jantra mantras and tantras smelled
 isko pehali baar satgur gobind singh ne banaaya tha
 The water prepared by this method is called "pahul"
 aam bhashaa main ise log amrit bhi kehete hai
 By drinking this, the Sikh becomes a part of the Khalsa Army, that is, he has now surrendered his body and wealth to God, now he will only proclaim the truth and if the need arises, he will not back down from cutting his throat
 sab vikaron se dur rahegaa
 Such a Sikh is also called Amritdhari
 yah pahul paanchon ko pilaai gai or unhen paanch pyaaron ke kitaab se niwaja
 2 Kakkar was already in Sikhism
 jahaan sikh atmik satl par sab se bheen samaj rakhata tha satgur gobind singh ji ne un do kakaron ke saath saath kangha, kadaa or kacha de kar shaareerik dekh main bhi khalse ko bhinn kar diya
 Today, Khande Bate's Pahul prepares only five beloved
 yah prikriya aaj rivaaj ban gayi he
 Today the test is not taken as it was
 is prikriya ko amrit sanchaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 History is a witness to the fact that Guru Gobind Singh ji also used to run under five love and obeyed his orders
 paanch pyaaron ne gobind singh ko chamkor kaa kila chhodane kaa hukum diya or unhen maananaa padaa
 The five loves then interrupted Gobind Singh ji, while Gobind Singh was greeting Dadu's tomb to examine these
 gobind singh ne banda bahadur ko bhi paanch pyaaron ke sang bheja gaya, itihaas main zikr he ki jab banda bahadur pyaaron kii ulanghnaa karata rahaa to banda bahadur ko sab kile main chhod gaye
 Gobind Singh and the Khalsa army helped Bahadur Shah and also took iron from his brother to make him the ruler
 khalsa ne hi guru gobind singh kii baniyon ko khoja or granth ke rup main dhaala

 In 1895 X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Konrad Runtzen, a professor of physics at the University of Wurtzburg in Germany
 yadi kaanch kii nalika main se vaayu ko pump se kramash: nikaala jaae or usamen ucch vibhav kaa vidyudvisarjan kiya jaae, to daab ke paryaapt alp hone par vaayu swayan prakashit hone lagati he
 While conducting an experimental study of this phenomenon, Rantzen observed that when the air pressure was very low, the rays coming out of the sluice tube gave light to barium platinocyanide and, when the tube was completely covered with black paper Also, the manibh kept nearby keeps on shouting
 at: yah spasht tha ki visarjananalika ke baahar jo kirane aati hai ve kaale kaagaj main se sugamawa se paar ho sakati hai or barium platinosynide ke parade ko dhyutimaan karne kaa vishesh gun in kirnon main he
 Such rays were not yet known in science
 at: in nai avishkrut kirnon kaa naam 'eksrez' rakhaa gaya, kintu rantjan ke sammaan main, visheshat : germany main, in kirnon ko 'rantjan kirane' hi kaha jaataa he
 As soon as Rantzen's invention was published, the attention of the entire scientific world was attracted to X-ray
 apaardarshee thos padaartho main se paar hone kaa eksre kaa gundharm atyant mahatvapurn tha or is gundharm kaa upyog vigyaan ke anek vibhaagon main ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, efforts were made to produce X-rays and study their properties in many physics laboratories
 alp daab par vaayu main jo vidyut visarjan hota he, uske adhyayan kaa aadhunik bhautikee ke vikaas main ek vishesh sthaan he
 If by connecting a long glass tube with a vacuum pump, the inner air flows through a high voltage current, initially, when the pressure is high, no action is seen, but when the air pressure is reduced first Both are electronegative
 daab ko or kam karne par sampurna nalika dhyutimaan ho jaati he
 According to the interpretation of modern physics, the reason is that when electrons get energy and they move with the remaining air molecules while moving at high velocity towards the positive
 sanghaton ke kaaran anuon ke aayan banate hai or jab ye aayan purv avasthaa ko praapt hote hai tab prakaash kaa utsarjan hota he
 Due to the existence of ions, electrophoresis continues in the air
 daab ke atyant alp ho jane par electranon se sanghaat hone ke liye paryaapt anu nahin rahete; at: electron runagra se nikalakar apni sampurna urja se dhanagar se sidhe takaraate hai
 Due to these effects, the intense energy of electrons gets to the atoms of the cation and one result is the production of X-rays
 is paddati se eksre kaa utpaadan karne ke liye nalika main ek kranthik daab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If the air pressure is higher than this critical pressure, then there is not enough energy in the electrons to produce the x-ray
 duusari ore, yadi daab is kranthik daab se kam ho to electron utpann hi nahin hote, at: vidyudvisarjan hi band ho jaataa he
 Initially the X-ray was produced using a similar type of aerial and the air pressure was kept at a critical value of this critical pressure
 eksre ke do vishesh gundharm adhik mahatvapurn hai : There are three main methods of intensity measurement
 pratideept parade par eksre se jo dipti aati he uski tivrata-maryaadit dipti tak-eksre kii tivrata kii samaanupati hoti he
 The intensity of the x-ray can be broadly compared by estimating the intensity of fluorescence
 duusari vidhi main photo pattica ke upar eksre kii jo kriya hoti he, uskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The blackness that comes from the X-ray incident on the photo plate depends on the intensity of the X-ray and the time of incidence
 is paddati se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii tulana karne ke liye adhik tivrata ke eksre punj se photo pattica par maryaadit sthaan par kisi upyukt kaal tak kriya hone di jaati he or tatpashchaat usee pattica par kuch neeche duusare eksre punj kii kriya kaal t, 2t, 3t aadi tak hone di jaati he
 After developing the plaque, comparing the blackness of the two pictures gives a sense of the relative intensity of the two arms
 tivrathamapan kii teesri reeti adhik prachlit he, kyonki is reeti se tivrata thik thik maapi ja sakati he
 When the x-ray passes through the air, the air becomes electronegative and its conductivity depends on the intensity of the x-ray
 eksre kii kriya se vaayu ke anuon ke electron visthapit hote hai or aayan utpann hote hai
 In the presence of proper electrodepolarization, the electrons that can be obtained from ions can be measured with a sensory electronometer, or with other appropriate sensory devices
 eksre kii tivrata vidyuddhara kii samaanupati hoti he
 More recently, the use of multiplier-illuminant and x-ray sensing spurs has made intensity measurements extremely accessible
 usee prakaar, gaigagunak kii sahaayta se ynikaran kii dhara kaa maapan bhi sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 Therefore, measurement of intensity of X-rays by both these types of devices is more prevalent in present day
 tivrathamapan kii in teenon prachlit ritiyon se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii keval tulana hi ho sakati he, nirpeksh tivrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 In fact, we can call the intensity of the X-ray as the energy exerted per second on an area of one square centimeter perpendicular to the x-ray
 is tivrata ko arg prati varg centimetre prati senkad main vyakt karte hai
 In order to measure intensity as energy, the energy of the X-ray is very low because in this way intensely specific instruments are required for intensification
 is reeti se tivrathamapan kaa pratham prayaas terril ne kiya tha
 Subsequently, in 1953, Henderson, BT and Laffan of the University of Illinois in the United States also tried
 ati prachand vidyudvibhav se utpann eksre kii tivrata keval isi reeti se naapi ja sakati he
 Experimental work of physics always requires units and has its shape according to the measured amount
 eksre kii maatra ke ekak ko 'rantjan' kehete hai or vartmaan kaal main ek rantjan kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit prakaar se kii jaati he- Another special feature of X-rays is their solubility
 bhinn bhinn thos pindon kii samaan motaayiyon main se paar hone par eksre kii tivrata main jo kami hoti he vah samaan nahin hoti
 The absorption of X-rays is higher in some solids and less in some substances
 prayog dwaara yah fal praapt hua ki kisi thos vishesh kii bhinn bhinn motaayiyon main se yadi eksre paar jaae, to nirgat eksre ko tivrata, praarambhik tivrata or thos padaarth kii motaai, in teenon main nimnlikhit sameekaran ke anusaar sambandh rahata he : log = - m × thickness --- yahan = eksre kii praarambhik tivrata; i = intensity of x-ray after crossing through solid material; m = ek sthiraank, jisko 'avasorana gunak' kehete hai
 This constant is called that solid's special x-ray-absorption-multiplier
 vastut: yah rekhiy gunak he
 To express it broadly, it is divided into the density of that solid substance and thus the absorption coefficient obtained is called 'code-absorption-factor'
 at: mmass = m / density sanhati-avasorana-gunak kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki vah avasorak padaarth kaa lakshanik gundharm he
 For example, the linear absorption-multiplier of water and steam is different, because water is liquid and steam is gas
 parantu jal tathaa bhaap kaa eksre sanhati-avasorana-gunank samaan hi hota he, kyonki jal tathaa bhaap ke rasinic sanrachak abhinn hai arthath hydrogen tathaa oxijan
 The variation of the properties of light and x-rays is very clear from the code-absorption-multiplier
 saadhaarant: drav or thos padaarth prakaash ke liye swayan apaardarshee athwa parbhasak hote hai
 Diamond is transparent and graphite opaque to light, but the codon-absorption-coefficient of X-ray remains the same for diamond and graphite, as these two materials are essentially different forms of carbon
 eksre nalika se jo sampurna eksre praapt hote hai, un sabakaa avasorana-gunak mukhyat: vidyudvibhav or avasorak parade kii dhaatu kaa parmaanu-kramank, in donon par nirbhar rahata he
 As the voltage increases, the penetration or hardness of the x-ray produced increases
 sameekaran se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kisi ek thos padaarth ke liye avasorana gunak sab motaayiyon ke liye sthir rahegaa
 But in direct use, the low passable portion of radiation received from the x-ray tube is completely absorbed in the first levels of the absorber screen
 keval adhik praveshkshmata ke eksre avasorana parade ke antim staron tak pahunch pate hai
 It is clear that the absorption factor of the x-ray entering the absorption screen is higher than the absorption factor of the x-ray crossing the absorption screen
 jab samast eksre kaa avasorana gunak samaan hota he tab unako samang eksre kehete hai
 Thus the amount of X-rays is measured by their intensity and their characteristic by their absorption-multiplier
 jis padaarth se prakaash aata he us padaarth ko ham dekh sakate hai, kyonki prakaash kirnon kii ek kriya hamaari aankh ke roopaadhar par hoti he
 This type of action is not by X-ray, so X-rays are not visible
 itnaa hi nahin, aankhon par tathaa sharir ke anya angon par eksre kii kriya atyant hanikaarak hoti he
 Due to the action of X-rays on living cells for a sufficient period of time, they are reduced
 eksre sharir ke charm main se saralata se paar ho jate hai or bheetar ke jivit koshaaon par inaki paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se unke mrit ho jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Again, X-ray effects are durable; Therefore, X-ray activity continues at different places at the same place of the body, and in some periods, cancer-like refractory diseases occur
 at: eksre kaa upyog karte samay atyant saavdhaanee se kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Special tools are used to protect the body
 iske atirikt eksre kaa nity upyog karanevaale vartmaan kaal main ek eksre-maatra-maapi apni jeb main rakhte hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki vikiran kii kitni maatra karmchaaree ke upar kaary kar chuki he
 This lethal property of X-rays is also used in other diseases; For example, if harmful pathogens grow in any part of the body, they can be destroyed by using X-rays on them
 eksre kaa ayurvigyaan main, visheshat: shalyakarm main, adhik upyog hota he
 The possibility of this type of use was evident from the time of X-ray's invention
 sharir ke bhinn-bhinn avyavon ke avasorana-gunak vibhinn hote hai; at: sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag main se eksre paar karke photo lene se asthiyaan tathaa anya ghatak pruthak pruthak dikhaai dete hai 
 Therefore, X-ray photographs are very useful before surgery, or to find out what condition the disease is in
 eksre ke utpaadan main pragati hone par unka upyog udyogon main bhi hone laga or vartmaan kaal main dhaatuvigyaan main eksre kaa upyog aavashyak ho gaya he
 Energy is either combined with particles or combined with waves
 kisi udgam se urja kaa visarjan hota ho to is urja kaa astitv saadhaarant: vidyucchambukiy tarangon kii tivrata main, athwa electron, proton, neutron, aayan ityadi kanon kii gatij urja ke rup main, vyakt hota he
 The patterns of wave and particle are different; Therefore, they are usually kept in different categories
 kintu anek prayogon ke falon se yah spasht ho gaya he ki in virgon kaa bandhan tarangon main kanon ke gun hai or, vilomat: kanon main bhi tarangon ke gun hai
 This duality form began with the principle of the heat of the Planck
 eksre ke gun bhi is dwait rup ke apwaad nahin hai
 X-rays have certain properties of waves and certain properties are also of particles
 pehle ham tarangeey gunon par vichaar karenge
 From the fruits of early experiments, it was clear that X-rays and light have properties comparable
 eksre tathaa prakaash kii kirnon kaa dik main saral rekhaon main prachaaran hota he
 Like light, the intensity of an x-ray is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance
 photo pattica par honevaali kriya tathaa gas main kiye gaye ynikaran ke gunon main bhi donon main samya he
 In 1905 AD, by experiment, Marx proved that the velocity of the x-ray is the same as the velocity of light — that is, 3 × 10 ° cm per second
 vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey kshetron main eksre aprabhavit rahete hai
 It was clear from all these properties that X-rays are electromagnetic in nature, not light charged particles
 bhed keval tarangadairghyo main ho saktaa he
 From the experiments of scientists such as Haga, Windt, Walters, Pol, Sommerfeld, etc
, it could be inferred that the wavelength of the x-ray was 1 × 10–8 cm
 Is near kintu pratham nirnayaatmak fal lave, freederish tathaa kniping ke prayogon se praapt hua or eksre kii tarangadairghy pramanit hui
 After this experiment, several attempts were made to clarify the wavelength of the X-ray and to obtain experimental results of other results in relation to it and to obtain experimental results of other dimensions with respect to it

 Although this method of estimating the amount of hydrogen is known in our galaxy, some scientists believe that this correlation between the carbon monoxide's brightness and the amount of hydrogen may not be true in some other galaxies
 "aanvik badal" ko angrezi main "molecular cloud" kehete hai
 Giant clouds of molecules ten thousand to ten million times larger than the size of our sun are called giant molecular clouds
 yah kabhi-kabhi sau prakaash-varsh ke vyas tak pahunch jate hai
 Where the density of particles in the vyom of our solar system is one particle per cubic centimeter, 10,000–10,00,000 particles per cubic centimeter can reach these clouds

 newton ke gati niyam teen bhautik niyam hai jo chirsmmat yantriki ke aadhaar hai
 These rules describe the relationship between the force exerted on an object and the speed of that object
 inhen teen sadiyon main anek prakaar se vyakt kiya gaya he
 Newton's three laws of motion, traditionally, are summarized as follows: sabase pehle newton ne inhe apane granth philasphi nechuralis principia mathematica main sankalit kiya tha
 Newton used them to explain the problems related to the motion of physical objects in many places
 apane granth ke tritiy bhaag main newton ne darshaya ki gati ke ye teenon niyam or unke saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa niyam sammilit rup se kepler ke akashiya pindon kii gati se sambandhit niyam kii vyakhya karne main samarth hai
 Newton's law of motion is applied only to those objects which we can consider as a particle
 matlab ki un vastuon kii gati ko napate samay unke aakar ko nazarandaz kiya jaataa he
 These rules are applied by considering the objects of those objects centered in a single point
 aisa tab kiya jaataa he jab vishleshan main dooriyaan vastuyon kii tulana main kaaphi bade hote he
 Therefore, the planets can be measured as a particle and their orbital speed can be measured
 apane mul rup main in gati ke niyamo ko drudh or virupanshil pindon par nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In 1750, Leonard Euler expanded Newton's speed rules and created Euler's speed rules that could also be applied to rigid and deformable bodies
 yadi ek vastu ko asatat kanon kaa ek sangyojan mana jaye, jiname alag-alag kar ke newton ke gati niyam lagaaye ja sakate he, to ular ke gati niyam ko newton ke gati niyam se viyuttpann kiya ja saktaa he
 Newton's laws of motion also apply in some direction systems, called inertial direction systems
 kai lekhako kaa maananaa he ki pratham niyam jadtviya nirdesh tantra ko paribhaashit karata he or dwitiya niyam sirf unhi nirdesh tantron se main maanya he isi kaaran se pehle niyam ko dusre niyam kaa ek vishesh rup nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 But some consider the first rule to be the result of the second
 nirdesh tantron kii spasht avadharana newton ke marane ke kaaphi samay pashchaat viksit hui
 Newtonian mechanics has now been replaced by Einstein's theory of special relativity, but it is still used for objects at a speed less than the speed of light
 newton ke mul shabdon main Hindi translation "prayek vastu apane sthiravastha athwa ekasmaan vegavastha me tab tak rahati he jab tak use kisi bahya kaarak dwaara avasthaa main badlaav ke liye prerit nahin kiya jaataa
 " duusare shabdon main, jo vastu viraam avasthaa main he vah viraam avasthaa main hi rahegi tathaa jo vastu gatiman hai vah gatiman hi rahegi jab tak ki us par bhi koi bahari bal naa lagaaya jaae
 Newton's first law defines inertia, a natural property of matter that opposes changes in momentum
 isliye pratham niyam ko jadtv kaa niyam bhi kehete he
 This rule also indirectly defines the inertial reference system and force
 iske kaaran newton dwaara is niyam ko pratham rakhaa gaya
 Simple authentication of this rule is difficult because the bodies feel the effects of friction and gravity
 asal main newton se pehle galileo ne is prekshan kaa varnan kiya
 Newton expressed it in other words
 newton ke mul shabdo main : Translation in hindi " kisi vastu ke samveg me aayaa badlaav us vastu par aropit dhakke ke samaanupati hota he tathaa samaan disha main ghatit hota he
 "the following points can be arranged by Newton's law: jahaan f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} bal, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} samveg or t { \ displaystyle t} samay hai
 According to this equation, when there is no external force on a body, the momentum of the body remains constant
 jab pind kaa dravyaman sthir hota he, to sameekaran zyaada saral rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: Where m { \ displaystyle m} is mass and a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} is acceleration
 yani kisi pind kaa twaran aropit bal ke anukramanupati he
 The impulse relates to the Second Rule
 aaveg kaa matlab he samveg main parivartan
 meaning: jahaan i aaveg he
 Very important in the analysis of impulse collisions
 mana ki kisi pind kaa dravyaman m he
 Applying a rule force f to this for ान्तt time period, the velocity changes to ∆v
 tab newton- Therefore, the impulse given to a body is similar to the change in momentum produced in the body
 at: aaveg kaa maatrak vahi hota he jo samveg kaa he
 The third law means that there is another force corresponding to a force that is equal and opposite to it
 newton ne is niyam ko istemaal karke samveg sangrakshan ke niyam kaa varnan kiya, lekin asal main samveg sangrakshan ek adhik moolbhoot siddhant he
 There are many examples in which momentum is preserved but the third rule is not valid

90 Pawai Pipariya is a village in Lakhisarai, Bihar
 jameendaari pratha bharat main mughal kaal evam british kaal main prachlit ek rajnatik-saamaajik kuriti thi jisamen bhoomi kaa swaamitv us par kaam karne waalon kaa na hokar kisi or kaa hota tha jo kheti karne waalon se kar vasuulate the
 This practice was abolished after India became independent
 bharat kii pracheen vichaardhaara ke anusaar bhoomi saarvajanik sampatti thi, isaliye yah vyakti kii sampatti nahin ho sakati thi
 Land, like air, water and light, was considered a gift of nature
 maharishi jaimini ke matanusaar "raja bhoomi kaa samarpan nahin kar saktaa tha kyonki yah uski sampatti nahin varan maanav samaaj kii sammilit sampatti he
 That is why everyone has equal rights over it "
 manu kaa bhi spasht kathan he ki "rishiyon ke matanusaar bhumiswamitv kaa pratham adhikaar use he jisane jangal katkar use saaf kiya tha jota" 
 Therefore, in a very large part of ancient India, the head of the village was elected by the village community and he was appointed with the consent of the state
 rajya use bhoomikar na dene par hataa saktaa tha, yadhyapi yah pad vanshanugat tha tathaa isaki prapti ke liye janamat tathaa rajyasweekruti aavashyak thi
 Therefore, those who are not elected were different from present-day landlords
 pracheen bharat main bhoomi kaa sampatti ke rup main krayvikray sambhav nahin tha
 This fact has also been confirmed by Western scholars Baden Powell and Sir George Campbell
 campbell kaa kathan he ki bhoomi jotane kaa adhikaar ek adhikaar maatr hi tha or hindu vyavastha ke anusaar bhoomi nahin mana gaya tha
 It has been known by modern research that in ancient India, there were feudatories, overheads, bhogikas, Pratiharas and Dandanayaks
 ye log newnaadhik samantpratha ke anukool the
 But we have not been sure about their rights and duties, except that these people used to send troops to their owners when needed
 in adhikariyon ko paarishramik ke rup main bhoomi pradaan kii jaati thi
 According to Yajnavalkya regarding the land system, there were four classes, Mahipati, Kshetraswami, Krishak and Shikami
 acharya brihaspati ne kshetraswami ke sthaan main keval swami shabd kaa hi prayog kiya he parantu iskaa spashtikaran kar diya he ki swami, raja or khetihar ke madhya kaa varg tha
 The above description only indicates the classification of land holdings, and not to bring the farmer to the level of an Anglo slave
 mukhya prashn to yah he ki bhoomi par swatv adhikaar kisko - rajya ko, krishak ko athwa kisi madhyavarti varg ko vidwaanon ke matanusaar pracheen bharat main yah adhikaar hi tha jo swatv adhikaar nahin kaha ja saktaa
 We do not find any transformation in this ancient land during Yavana rule and neither is there any change in the basic principles of land-rights
 yavan shaasha bhoomikar gaanv ke mukhiya dwaara hi vasuul karte the or kabhi-kabhi sthaneey saradaaron vaa raajaaon dwaara, jo apana str gaanv ke mukhiya se unchaa hone kaa daawa karte the
 The claim of these kings appears to have produced an intermediate class between the state and the cultivator
 parantu samantvaad pad avrodh sthaayee rakhaa gaya tha kyonki rajya sarvada in raajaaon ko karmchaaree hi maanate the
 Although these kings were beginning to be hereditary, the state always had the right to grant and take back their post
 ek raja ke uttaradhikari ko raja kii sanad praapt karne ke liye prarthanapatr dena padataa tha or sanad kii prapti ke pashchaat hi vah raja hota tha
 In the Ainacabari, no intermediate class is recognized between the farmer and the state
 tathakthith raja or jameendaar saidhantik or vaastavik rup main keval kar vasuul karanevaale karmchaaree hi the
 It is notable that the Yavana rulers never claimed land-ownership-rights
 yah baat in aitihaasik tathyon se spasht he ki aurangzeb ne hundi, palam tathaa anya sthanon par krishakon se bhoomi kharidi thi, jaisaa akbar ne akbarabad or elahabaad main kile banane ke liye kiya tha
 Shah Jahan also did the same, it is proved from the above evidence that the Yavana rulers believed in property rights only in collecting taxes and not in the land
 unke shasankaal main krishak ke adhikaron ko ucchtam manyata di gai thi
 The farmer used to give it by the king and the head of the village and the king and the chief received remuneration for this work by the state
 san 1707 i0 main aurangzeb kii mrityu ke pashchaat krishakon ke adhikaron kaa lop dhire-dhire aarambh hua jab ki kendriya satta shithil padane lagi
 The sentiment of semi-feudal selfishness emerged during this time of monopoly
 jab rajya kii satta shithil padane lagi, rajya ke karmchaaree praja ke janmaal kii raksha karne main asamarth hone lage
 As a result, the villagers began to take the help of powerful employees and kings or chiefs for the protection
 in logon ne swabhaavat: sharnaarthi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron par akraman kiya
 Under these conditions, seedlings of Zamindari system are found
 parantu is sankatkaal main bhi krishakon ke bhoomyadhikaron kaa purna samarpan nahin hua tha
 Zamindari system started to emerge from the arrival of British in India
 angrej shaskaon kaa vishwaas tha ki ve bhoomi ke swami hai or krishak unki praja hai isaliye unhone sthaayee tathaa asthaayee bandobast bade krishakon tathaa raajaaon or jameendaaron se kiye
 Although impressed by the political rationale, he leased one pargana to the monopolist who collected every tax for five years
 is prakaar jameendaari pratha ko angrajon ne manyata pradaan kii yadhyapi aarambh main unka vichaar krishakon ko unke adhikaron se vanchit karne kaa nahin tha san 1786 i0 main lard corn walis, warren hestigaj ke baad, garvanar general hua
 Lord Cornwallis was also in favor of Zamindari system
 usne san 1791 i0 bengal, bihar tathaa urisa main das varshiya bandobast kii ajna di
 Two years later, the Board of Directors gave permission to make this ten-year plan a permanent settlement
 madras main jameendaari pratha kaa udai angrej shaskaon kii nilaam niti dwaara hua
 The lands of the villages were divided and auctioned and sold to the highest payer
 prarambh main avadh main bandobast krishak se hi kiya gaya tha parantu tadnantar raajnneetik kaarnon se yah bandobast jameendaaron se kiya gaya
 In the settlement report of the great historian Sir Vincent A
 Smith, Aligarh, it clearly acknowledges that the settlements were made to the monopolies, aiming only at utility, ignoring the prevailing land rights
 anyaaypurna karrashi ikattha karne kaa yah sabase saral upaay he tathaa yah raajnneeti ke drushtikon se bhi upyogi he kyonki iske falswaroop sarkaar kaa ek shaktishaalee tathaa dhani varg kii sahaayta milti rahegi
 Thus in the history of India for the first time these settlements established the class of landlords between the state and the farmers by the policy of the British, which resulted in the loss of the property rights of the farmers who had been in existence since time immemorial
 yah madhyavarti varg din prati din dhani hota gaya kyonki angrej shaasha apni karrashi main se adhik se adhik hissaa unhen pralobhan ke rup main dete rahe
 In these settlements, no attention was paid to the interests of the farmers, as a result of which their grief, humiliation and humiliation increased day by day
 kai baar angrej shaskaon ne bhi is ore dhyaan dilaayaa ki krishakon kii bhudhruti kii raksha kii jaay evam unka lagaan bandobast ke samay tak nirdhaarit kar diya jaay
 Still nothing was done
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki angrej shaskaon kii dharna thi ki jameendaaron ke saath vyavhaar main udaartaa dikhaane par jab ve sampann evam santusht rahenge to ve apane asamiyon ko nahin sataayenge jiske falswaroop ve bhi khushhaal rahenge
 But this was his great mistake because the landlords always betrayed their duty
 at: angrej shaasha yah mahasoos karne lage ki is bhul kaa sudhaar kiya jaae
 As a result, they arranged land related legislation to improve the condition of the farmers
 yah kadam jameendaari pratha ke ast kii disha main pratham charan kaha ja saktaa he
 In this first phase, which lasted from 1859 AD to 1929 AD, the laws that were enacted imposed certain restrictions on the rights of landlords to increase the rent and also benefited the higher class farmers
 kintu in kanoonon kaa mukhya uddeshy jameendaaron ko lagaan vasuul karne main sahuuliyat dene kaa tha jisase ve rajya ko rajasav thik samay par de saken
 In 1859 AD, the first land related act was passed
 yah adhinium samast british bharat ke liye ek adarsh bhoomi-adhinium tha jiske anuroop adhinium bharat ke sabhi bhaagon main paas hue or samay samay par unamem sanshodhan bhi kiye gaye taaki asantusht krishakon ko shant kiya ja sake
 But the landlords still continued to squeeze the peasants to recover their just and unjust taxes, which caused widespread dissatisfaction and restlessness among the farmers
 jameendaari pratha ke ast ke kram main doosraa charan san 1930 i0 se 1944 i0 tak rahaa
 During this time, peasant movements started happening all over the country
 in andolanon kaa beej ek kisaan sabha ne boyaa tha jo akhil bhartiya congress kii elahabaad baithak main taarikh 11 farvari san 1918 i0 ko hui thi
 After that the Congress started to advance the interests of the farmers
 parinaam swaroop gramin janata main kaaphi jagrati paidaa ho gai
 Pt
 Jawaharlal Neh degree announced in the U
P
 Congress Committee on 27 October 1928 that political freedom is meaningless till the farmers get freedom from exploitation
 shanai: shanai: kisaanon kii jaagrukta badi or saath hi saath unki vyakulata bhi
 The peasant class became more vocal and demanded the stability of land holdings and reduction in revenue
 kisaan andolanon se prabhavit hokar raiyyatwarikshetron main nae adhinium banaae gaye jinase krishakon ke hiton kii raksha ho sake
 The Malabar Tenancy Act is a landmark in this regard
