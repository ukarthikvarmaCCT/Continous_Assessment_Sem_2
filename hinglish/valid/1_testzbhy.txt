 Changing wind conditions are other risk factors
 garm dinon main tej hawaaon or vayumandaleey vikshobh kii paristhitiyon main parachutist jameen ke kareeb downdraft main pakade ja sakate hai
 Changing winds can result in slant winds or downward winds in which the probability of injury is greatly increased as wind speed is added to the landing speed
 jokhim kaa ek anya kaarak "chhatari kaa takaraa janaa" yaa puri tarah se phulae gaye parashooton ke neeche do athwa adhik skydiveron kii takkar he
 An inflated parachute of the jumper gets tangled with each other due to an umbrella collision, often resulting in one or more parachutes suddenly failing
 When this happens, jumper often must quickly perform emergency procedures which include "getting cut off" from their main umbrella and using their reserve canopies
 chhatari kii takkar tab vishesh rup se khatarnaak ho jaati he jab oonchai itani kam hoti he ki jamparon ko apni mukhya chhatari se surakshit rup se mukt hone or apane rigerv parashooton kaa puri tarah se istemaal karne ke liye paryaapt samay nahin mil paata he
 Equipment failure rarely causes fatalities and injuries
 kisi mukhya parachute ke ek hajaar istemaal main takreeban ek baar parinaam isaki kharabi ke rup main saamne aata he
 ram-air parachutes generally start to move around uncontrollably only when they are damaged, so the reserve parachute must be freed before use
 rigerv parachute ko alag prakaar se pack kiya jaataa he or alag tareeke se istemaal kiya jaataa he, inhen or adhik sangrakshit dhang se dizin kiya or banaaya jaataa he, saath hi inkaa pareekshan kahin adhit sateek maanakon par hota he jisase ye mukhya parachute se kahin adhik vishwasaneey hote hai, lekin vaastavik suraksha laabh ek apratyaashit mukhya kharabi kii sambhaavna se aati he jo ek rigerv kharabi kii apekshaakrit kam sambhavit andeshe ke kaaran kai guna bad jaati he
 This creates a far smaller possibility of a double fault although there is a possibility of a major malfunction that cannot be cut off, causing a reverse malfunction which is a very real risk

 un filmon main aksar paatro ko aise kartab karte hue dikhaaya jaataa he jo vishesh prabhaavon kii madad ke bina pratyaksh rup se asambhav hai
 In other cases, their practice may collapse or fail in a safety-conscious drop zone or club

 In many countries it is necessary to have a conscious discretion to either the local rules or the obligation of drop zone owners that the parachutist must have reached the age of maturity before joining the sport
 kharaab mausam, vishesh rup se badal garajane or bijli vaale tufaanon, tej hawaaon or dhul bhari aandhiyon shaitanon main parashooting ek khatarnaak gatividhi ho sakati he

 It uses two major systems: a "throw-out" in which the skydiver pulls a toggle attached to the top of the pilot-shoot, decorated in a small pocket outside the main container: and a "pull-out" in which the skydiver is in the container
 Pulls a small pad attached to the pilot-shoot decorated inside
 thro-out payalat-shoot ke paauch aam taur par container ke tal par rakhe jate hai - bi
o
si
 tainaati pranali - lekin puraani samagriyon main paauch aksar pair main lage hote hai
 The second option is safer for flat-flying but is often unsuitable for freestyle or head-down flying
 ek vishesh gaiyr-sainya parachute pranali, jaise ki thro-out main payalat-shoot ek line se juda hota he jise "lagaam " ke rup main janaa jaataa he jo ek chote se tainaati bag se judaa hota he jisamen modaa hua parachute maujuud rahata he, saath hi latakaav vaali line rabar bandon main saji hoti hai
 At the bottom of the container, which holds the deployment bag, is a closed loop that is held through the grommets of the four flaps used to close the container during packing
 us samay ek tedha pin jo lagaam se judaa hua he, ise band loop ke madhyam se daalaa jaataa he
 The next step involves turning the pilot-shoot and placing it in a pouch
 sakriyan tab shuru hota he jab payalat-shoot ko baahar phenk diya jaataa he
 It spreads and creates a stretch, the pin is pulled out of the closed loop and helps the pilot-shoot pull the deployment bag out of the container
 parachute linon ko rabar bandon se dhila khinchaa jaataa he or chhatari khulanaa shuru hote hi fail jaataa he
 a rectangular piece of cloth called a "slider" slows down the parachute's opening and works downward and along its path until the umbrella is fully opened and the slider is turned into a skydiver
 Does not come right above the head
 slider parachute kii tainaati ko dhimaa or niyantrit karata he
 The parachute spreads rapidly without a slider which can potentially damage parachute fabric and / or hanging lines

 If a skydiver experiences a malfunction in his main parachute that he cannot fix, he pulls a "cut-away" handle on the right side of his harness that removes the main umbrella from the harness / container
 is
 ek baar kharaab mukhya chhatari se mukt ho jane ke baad saamne ke baayen harnes par sthit ek duusare handle ko khinchakar rigerv chhatari ko swayan sakriy kiya ja saktaa he
 Some containers are fitted with a contact line from the main to the reserve parachutes - known as a reserve static line - that pulls and opens the reserve container much faster than it can be removed by itself

 kuch skydiver camera udaan main daksh hote hai or kuch prashikshit kudon yaa agranukram-jamparon par chaatro ko filmaane ke liye fees lete hai, yaa media ke liye peshewar drishy or tasviren taiyaar karte hai
 There is always a demand for good camera fliers in the skydiving community as many competitive topics related to skydiving are judged by looking at a video record

 "samraat krishnadev raay " dakshin bharat ke pratapi samraaton main ek the jinke vijaynagar samrajya kii khyaati videshon tak faili hui thi
 The accession of Emperor Krishnadeva Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire to Magh Shukla Chaturdashi Samvat 1566 Vikrami was a wonderful event in the history of India
 is ghatana ko dakshin bharat main svarnim yug kaa prarambh mana jaataa he, kyonki unhone dakshin bharat main barbar mughal sultaanon kii vistaaravaadi yojana ko dhul chataakar adarsh hindu samrajya kii sthapana kii thi, jo aage chalakar chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke hindai swarajya kaa prerana strot bana
 Evaluating the emperor Krishna Dev Rai, a symbol of amazing valor and might, historians have written that within them there was a coherence of Hindu life ideals as well as the virtues of all Indian emperors
 inke rajya main vikramaditya jaisi nyaay vyavastha thi, chandragupta maury or samraat ashok jaisi sudrudh shashan vyavastha tathaa shringery math ke shankaracharya mahaan sant vidyaarany swami kii aakankshaon evam acharya chanakya ke nitigat tatwon kaa samavesh tha
 That is why in relation to him Babur wrote in Baburnama that Vijayanagar empire is the largest in terms of expansion of the kingdom of Kafirs and the strength of the army
 dakshin bharat main krishnadev raay or uttar bharat main rana sanga hi do bade kafir raja hai
 Although the coronation of Emperor Krishnadeva Raya in 1510 AD was the beginning of a new life for the Vijayanagara Empire, but it originated only in 1336 AD
 kehete hai ki vijay nagar samrajya ke pratham shaasha harihar tathaa unke bhai bukkarai bhagwaan shrikrishna ke bhakt the or unheen kii prerana se adharm kaa vinaash or dharm kii sthapana karnaa chaahate the
 Harihar once went to a forest area on the banks of the Tungabhadra river for hunting, the hunter dogs accompanying him ran a reindeer, but instead of running away, the deer overturned the hunted dogs
 yah ghatana bahut hi vicitra thi
 After the incident, one day suddenly Harihar Rai met the great saint Swami Vidhanya and he narrated the whole story to Swamiji
 is par sant ne kaha ki yah bhoomi shatru dwaara avijit or sarvaadhik shaktishaalee hogi
 Saint Vedhanya decided to settle that land and stay there himself
 yahi sthaan viksit hokar vijaynagar kaha gaya
 In fact, the mutual acrimony of the Hindu kings of South India, the expansionist campaigns of Alauddin Khilji and the decision by Mohammad Tughlaq to make India's capital at Devagiri shaken Swami Vidyaranya's Hindu heart, hence he wanted to establish a Shaktipeeth himself
 harihar raay ke prayaason se vijaynagar rajya bana or jis prakaar chandragupta ke pradhanmantri acharya chanakya the, usee prakaar vijaynagar samrajya ke mahaamantri sant vidyaarany swami or pratham shaasha bane harihar raay
 Gradually, the rule of Harihar Rai i spread south of Krishnanadi to the last border of India
 shaasha badalte gayi or harihar pratham ke baad bukkarai, harihar dwitiya, devaraay pratham, devaraay dwitiya, mallikarjun or viroopaksh ke haathon main shashan kii bagdor aayi, kintu dilli sultanate se alag hokar sthapit bahamani rajya ke mughalshaskon se lagaataar simavistaar hetu sanrghash hota rahaa

 main karnataka va telugana ke samant saluva narsinha ne bahamani sultaanon ko bhi parajeet karke vijaynagar samrajya ko narsinha samrajya main badal diya
 After this it seemed that now the Vijayanagara Empire would be absorbed in history, but it started again in 1510 AD and the coronation of Krishnadeva Raya took place at the young age of 20 years
 is rajbhishek ke samay portugaliyon ne goa main apana vyapaar surakshit rakhane ke liye bijapur ke sultan adilshaah par akraman karke goa par vijay praapt kar lee, kintu samraat krishnadev raay ne apni kootnithik chaalon se mughaliya sultanate ke pratinidhi adilshaah or portugaliyon ke madhya yudv kii aag ko hawa dene kaa kaam karne kaa satat prayaas kiya
 However, the Portuguese governor considered Emperor Krishnadeva Raya as the king of the south
 apane rajbhishek ke saath hi samraat krishnadev raay ne apana vijay abhiyaan bhi prarambh kar diya
 By 1516, many forts of Orissa were conquered and married to the daughter of the king of Orissa and established friendship

 Collected all the Hindu kings there to counter Sultan Quli of Golconda as Sultan Quli dominated the small states of the south

 rajbhishek varsh ke baad raichur kaa sangharsh samraat krishnadev raay ke jivan kaa sabase mahatvapurn sangharsh tha
 Raichur was a safe city
 jisamen ek sudrudh kila bhi tha, isko jeetne kii teevr oochha vijaynagar ke purv shaasha narsinha ke man main thi kyonki yah kila adilshaah ne narsinha ke purv shaskaon se chin liya tha
 In fact, Emperor Krishna Dev Rai had his vision of the Raichur Fort as well as the overthrow of the Mughal Empire
 samraat krishnadev raay ghodon ke bahut shaukeen the
 He sent forty thousand coins to a Mughal named Sidhekar to buy horses from the Mughals at Ponda, Goa, but that Mughal betrayed and ran into the territory of Adilshah with the Mughals of Ponda taking coins and horses
 donon rajyon kii chalis saal puraani sandhi ke aadhaar par duusare rajya ke apradhi ko sangrakshan dena sandhi kaa ulanghan tha, at: samraat krishnadev raay ne adilshaah ko patr likhakar bataaya ki sidemarakar ko dhan sahit turant vijaynagar samrajya ko saunp diya jaay, anyathaa parinaam bhayanak hoga
 Instead of sending that Mughal criminal to Vijay Nagar due to arrogance, Adilshah wrote a letter to the Emperor that according to Qazi's advice, he is a representative of the Prophet disguised by law, and knows the law, so he cannot be handed over to Vijayanagar
 is hathvadita ke virudv samraat krishnadev raay ne 7,36,000 sainikon kii vishaal sena ke saath raichur par dhaava bol diya
 He also got the Sultans of Berar, Bidar and Golconda diplomatically prepared not to speak in favor of Adilshah
 in sultaanon ko pataa tha ki yadi hamane adilshaah kii madad kii to samraat krishnadev ke coup se hamen bhi jujhna padegaa
 As a result, all of them did not stand in support of Adilshah, while they gathered all the Hindu kings together on the banks of Krishna river and attacked the Adilshahi army of Bijapur
 bhaybheet hokar adilshaah yudv ke maidan se bhaag gaya tathaa samraat krishnadevaraay kii vijay huyi
 This victory of Emperor Krishnadeva Raya was called the important victory of South India, which has far reaching consequences, which are as follows: 1
 adilshaah kii shakti or sammaan ko chakanachur karke bijapur ke us ahankaar ko unhone tod diya, jisamen vah dakshin bharat kaa sultan banane kaa swapn apni ankhon main sajoe hue tha
 2
 The other Mughal rulers of South India were shocked and started looking for a way to survive

 He even said to Adil Shah's messenger that Adilshah himself should come here to kiss my feet and dedicate his land and fort to us, then we can forgive him

 samraat krishnadev raay kii manyata thi ki shatruon ko shakti ke aadhaar par kuchal dena chahie or aisa hi unhone vyavhaar main bhi dikhaaya
 The virtues of the Vijayanagara Empire are evident in many instances of the famous scholar Tenali Ram of his court, which is still told in India for the development of virtue and virtues in children

 lagbhag 10 lakh kii sainya shakti, jisamen 32 hajaar ghudsavaar tathaa ek chota top khaanaa or hathi bhi the, vahaan kii sainik sudridhtaa ko prakat karata tha
 The Vijayanagara Empire was world-renowned for its ideal Hindu lifestyle
 jahaan ke maharaja krishnadev raay vaishnav hone ke baavjood bhi jain, baudv, shaiva, lingayat jaise bhartiya panthon hi nahin isai, yahudee or musalamaanon jaise abhartiya panthon ko bhi puri dharmik swatantraaa pradaan karte the
 The result of such a pervasive view was that the Vijayanagara Empire, founded in 1336, became a symbol of the mutual harmony and harmony and cohesive Hindu way of life of Hindus and Muslims or Christians, whereas ten years later, the Bahmani kingdom, established in 1347, was bitter, hostility towards Hindus
 And became a symbol of barbarism

 In the sixteenth century, the Portuguese traveler Paíz, describing the richness here, wrote that the king here has innumerable military power, abundant diamond gems, granary and commercial potential as well as incomparable treasures
 ek or portugali yatri nunij ne bhi isi baat kii pushti karte hue likhaa he ki vijaynagar main vishwa kii sarvaadhik prasidv heere kii khaane, yahaan kii samrudvi ko prakat karti hai
 Apart from military and economic strength, Emperor Krishnadeva Raya was also a scholar of high order
 sanskrit, kannada, telugu tathaa tamil bhashaaon ko protsaahan dene ke saath hi unhone apane samrajya main kala or samskruti kaa paryaapt vikaas kiya
 He built magnificent temples like Krishna Swami, Rama Swamy and Vitthal Swamy and also developed Hampi temple built in memory of Sant Swami Vidyaranya

 He attained deep realization by sitting at the feet of Maa Bhuvaneshwari Devi and as the disciple of Swami Bharatikrishna Tirtha Ji Maharaj, held the post of Shankaracharya of Sringeri Math

 The exam consists of four sections
 pehla khand likhit khand he, jabaki anya teen bahu-vikalp style hai
 One of the multiple-choice style exams will test verbal skills, the other one will test mathematical skills, and the third exam will be an experimental section that does not appear in the reported score
 pariksha lene vaale yah nahin jaanate hai ki bahu-vikalp khandon main se koun praayogic he
 The entire process of the examination takes 4 hours
 ek shreneekrut bahu-vikalp khand hameshaa ek maukhik khand hota he, jisamen saadrishyata, viparitarthak shabd, vaakyon ko puraa karnaa or uddhran bodh ko padhanaa shaamil he
 Multiple-choice response segments are graded on a scale of 200–800 with increments of 10 points
 yah khand mukhyat: shabd sangrah pareekshan karata he or is khand main ausat prapthank ganitiya khand kii tulana main mulat: kam hote hai
 In a typical exam, this section may consist of 30 questions and 30 minutes may be allotted to complete this section
 isamen aamtaur par viparitarthak shabdon ke sambandh main 8-10 prashn, saadrishyata ke 6-8 prashn, vaakya puraa karne ke 5-7 prashn or 6-10 bodh sambandhi prashnon ko padhanaa shaamil rahete hai
 The mathematical section, the other multiple-choice section, may include mathematical comparison questions involving problem solving and examining mathematics at the high-school level
 bahu-vikalp pratikraya khand 10 ank kii vriddhiyon ke saath 200-800 ke paimaane par shreneekrut kiye jate hai
 In a typical examination, this section may consist of 28 questions and the examinees may be given 45 minutes to complete this section
 is khand main vishisht rup se 14 ganitiya tulana sambandhi prashn, 10 asatat ganitiya prashn or 4 aankada prastutikaran sambandhi prashn shaamil hote hai
 The Analytical Writing section consists of two separate articles, a "topic work" and a "logic work"
 " lekhan varg ko aadhe ank kii vriddhiyon ke saath 0-6 ke paimaane par shreneekrut kiya jaataa he
 The articles are specially designed by ETS using a word processing program
 yah program keval computer ke moulik kaary karne detaa he or isamen vartanee kii jaanch karne vaali yaa anya unnat visheshtaayen nahin hoti hai
 Each essay is recorded by at least two readers on a six-digit composite scale
 yadi do prapthank ek hi ank ke bheetar rahete hai, to ek teesraa pathak pratikriya kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 If there is a difference of more than one digit between the two scores, then a third reader tests the response
 pariksha dene vaala vyakti do vishyon main se chunaav kar paayegaa kis kis vishay par niabandh likhnaa he
 The accepted time for this essay is 45 minutes
 vishay prasang kaa chayan prashnon ke ek sangrah se kiya jaataa hai
 The person taking the test will be given a "statement" and you will be asked to write an essay related to reviewing that statement
 The person taking the test will be asked to consider the logic of the statement and to make suggestions on how to improve the logic of that statement
 The time allotted for this essay is 30 minutes
 kathan ko vishyon ke sangrah se chunaa jaataa he
 The experimental section, which can be either an oral, mathematical or analytical writing task, includes new questions that ETS is considering for future use
 haalanki praayogic khand kii pariksha ke ank pariksha dene vaale ke ank main shaamil nahin kiye jate hai, yah agyaat hota he or pariksha ke vaastavik hisse ke samaan maaloom padataa he
 Since the examinees have no clear way of knowing which section is experimental, they are obliged to complete this section
 yadi praayogic khand ek vishleshnatmak lekhan prashn maaloom padataa he, yadi ek "vishay" rupi prashn prastut kiye jate hai, to do vishyon ke bich vikalp nahin diya jayega
 is baat ke saath milakar ki sachcha vishleshnatmak lekhan khand di gayi pehali pariksha he, yah pariksha dene vaale vyakti ko yah nishkarsh nikaalane main madad kar saktaa he ki koun sa khand praayogic khand he or is prakaar pariksha dene vaala vyakti us khand ke mahatva ko kam kar saktaa he
 The common multiple-choice part of the exam currently uses computerized adaptable testing methods that change the difficulty of automatic questions based on the number of correct or incorrect answers given along with the person taking the exam
 
 pariksha dene vaale vyakti ko waapas jane or pichley prashnon ke uttar ko badalane kii anumati nahin hoti he, aglaa prashn prastut karne ke pehle kuch uttar dena padataa he
 The first question to be given in a multiple-choice section is considered an "average level" question that half of the GRE test takers will answer correctly
 If the question is answered correctly, then the subsequent questions become more difficult
 yadi prashn kaa uttar galat bhang se diya jaataa he, to uske baad vaale prashn adhik saral ho jate hai
 This approach towards administration gives them the same degree of precision as about half of the subjects at the time of experimenting
 haalanki, GRE ke saath yah prabhaav kam hota he kyonki isaki ek nishchit lambaai hoti he, vastav main CAT kii lambaai parivartaneey hoti he, jahaan ek baar ummidavaar kii kshamta str nirdhaarit kar lene par pariksha swat: band ho jaayegi
 The test score is determined by subject response theory
 jabaki CAT IRT se judaa hua he, vastav main IRT kaa prayog score gaiyr-cat pariksha ke ank nirdhaaran karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 GRE subject exams, which are based on the traditional paper-and-pencil format, use the same method of marking in IRT
 CAT dwaara pradaan kiya jane vaala antar yah he ki vishay kaa chayan joshilay bhang se kiya jaataa he taaki pariksha dene vaala vyakti keval uchit kathinaayee vaale vishyon ko dekhtaa he
 In addition to the psychometric benefits, there is an additional benefit of not wasting the examinee's time by giving a very difficult or simple subject
 yah nishchit praaroop vaali pariksha main hota he
 a candidate can also score an ideal score of 800 excluding one or more of the multiple-choice questions
 isi tarah, yadi kisi bhi prashn kaa sahi uttar nahin diya jaataa he, to bhi 200 nunatam sambhav ank he
 The percentages of the current examination are as follows: "abhisht snaatak pramukh vishay" ke liye tulanaayen "un logon tak simit hai jinhone pariksha kii tithi se purv do varshon tak college kii apni degree arjeet kii"
 ETS un "gaiyr paaramparik chaatro" ke liye ank ke koi aankade uplabdh nahin karaata he jo do se adhik varshon tak vidhyalay se baahar rah chuke hai, haalanki iske apane report "RR-99-16" ne yah suchit kiya ki 1996 main pariksha dene vaale sabhi vyaktiyon ke 22% 30 varsh se adhik kii aayu ke the
 Many graduate schools in English-speaking countries require GRE results as part of the admission process
 GRE ek manakikrut pariksha he jo visheshgyata ke kshetra kii parvaah kiye bina saamaanya shaikshanik prakruti vaale kaaryon main sabhi snaatakon kii kshamta kaa maapan karne ke liye niyat he
 The GRE is expected to measure the extent to which undergraduate education has developed a person's literal and mathematical skills in abstract thinking
 anya manakikrut pravesh parikshaon ke samaan GRE ankon kaa upyog evam mahatva na keval ek skool se duusare skool main balki ek vibhaag se duusare vibhaag or ek paathyakram se duusare paathyakram main bhi bhinn hota he
 Unleashed art may only give importance to the verbal score of the applicant, while mathematics and science courses may consider only mathematical aptitude; However, since most graduates of mathematics, science or engineering undergraduate programs have high marks, verbal scores are also a deciding factor in these courses
 snaatak skulon main pravesh kai vibhinn karkon ke ek jatil mishran par nirbhar karata he
 The citation of schools consider the statement of purpose, GPA, GRE marks etc
 kuch skool pravesh sambandhi nirnyon main GRE kaa upyog karte hai, lekin nidhikaran sambandhi nirnyon main nahin; anyathaa ve chaatravrutti ke chayan or ummidavaaron kii shikshavriti ke chayan ke liye GRE kaa upyog karte hai, lekin pravesh ke liye nahin
 kuch maamalon main, GRE snaatak main pravesh paane ke liye vishvavidhyalay dwaara rakhi gai saamaanya aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, jabaki kuch khaas vibhaag ankon par koi bhi vichaar nahin kar sakate hai
 Graduate schools will specifically provide information regarding the consideration of the GRE in admissions and funding decisions and the average marks of previously enrolled students
 The best way to find out how a school or program evaluates the GRE score in the admissions process is to contact the person in charge of the particular course related to undergraduate admissions
 jis paathyakram main vivarnaatmak lekhan ullekhneey he uske liye ek taiyaar kiya hua lekhan sambandhi namoona prastut karne kii zarurat hoti he jise lekhan kshamta kaa nirdhaaran karne main vishleshnatmak lekhan khand kii apeksha adhik upyogi mana jaataa he; haalanki, kabhi-kabhi videshi chaatro ke lekhan sambandhi ankon kii adhik jaanch kii jaati he or unka upyog sanvadatmak angreji ke saath or usamen nipunata hasil karne sambandhi samgr prayaas ke suchak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 In addition to the general examination, there are also eight GRE subjects to test test knowledge in specific areas of biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, biology, chemistry, computer science, English literature, mathematics, physics and psychology
 ateet main arthshaastra, punarikshit shiksha, ejineering, bhuvigyaan, itihaas, sangeet, raajnneeti vigyaan or samajashaastra ke kshetra main bhi vishay kii parikshaayen lee gai

 However, there are many vocational schools that also accept GRE scores
 vyavsaayik skulon ke kuch maandand nimnlikhit hai: Compared to the gmat's emphasis on reasoning, the GRE measures the ability of test takers to be more vocabulary
 yah antar prayek pariksha ke dhaanche main parilakshith hota he
 Although the analytical writing section is common, the verbal section in the GRE includes analogies, antonyms, completing sentences, and reading comprehension citations, while the GMAT includes sentence refinement, difficult reasoning, and reading citations
 iske alaava, achche ank praapt karne ke liye GMAT main ucch ganitiya kshamta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 GRE kii taiyaari karne waalon ke liye vibhinn prakaar ke sansaadhan uplabdh hai
 Upon registration, ETS offers a software called Power Prep, which consists of two sets of practice tests for older questions and additional practice questions and study material
 chunki yah software pariksha praaroop or prayukt prashn donon ko doharaa saktaa he, yah vaastavik GRE prapthank kaa purvanumaan karne main upyogi ho saktaa he
 ETS does not license old queries to any other company, making it the only source of official used material
 ETS "BIG BOOK" prakashit kiya karata tha jisamen badi sankhya main vaastavik GRE prashn shaamil the; lekin, yah prakaashan band kar diya gaya
 Many companies provide unofficial content containing courses, books and other preparations
 ETS ne daawa kiya he ki GRE kii vishay-vastu "aprashikshaneey" he; haalanki, pariksha kii taiyaari karne vaali vibhinn companiyaan jaise ki kaplan, princeton rivyuu, iemes larning resorcej, VISU aadi daawa karti hai ki pariksha kaa praaroop itnaa kathin he ki pariksha ke sanghathan, samay, vishisht centrebindu se swayan ko parichit karaane or nishkasana kii prakriya kaa upyog GRE score ko badhaane kaa sabase acha tarika he
 While general and subject exams are conducted at many undergraduate institutions, computer-based general exams are conducted only at exam centers with appropriate technology adjustments
 sanyukt rajya america ke pramukh shaharon main chaatro yaa bade america vishvavidhyalayon main padhane vaale chaatro ko aam taur par nikat main hi pariksha centre mil jaayenge, jabaki adhik alag-thalag kshetron ke chaatro ko kisi shahari yaa vishvavidhyalay sthal par jane main kuch ghanton kii yatra kerani pad sakati he
 Many industrialized countries also have examination centers, but many times the examinees have to cross the boundaries of the country
 graduate skool kii safalataa kaa purvanumaan karne main GRE kii manyata ke vishleshan main GRE or pehle varsh or samgr snaatak GPA ke bich 
30 se 
45 ke bich sahasambandh paaya gaya
 The correlation between GRE scores and graduate school completion rates ranged from 
11 to 
39
 sankaay ke daron ke bich sahasambandh 
35 se 
50 tak tha
 The test takers complain about the rigid rules of the examination center
 udhaaharan ke liye, pariksha dene vaale vyakti kalam kaa upyog nahin kar sakate yaa apane swayan ke kaagaj ke tukade nahin laa sakate hai
 Paper and pencils are provided at the examination center
 pariksha kendron main khaadya or peya padaarth or saath hi saath chuing gam nishiddh hai
 Personal items such as jackets and caps can be inspected
 kuch sthanon par parikshaarthiyon ko pariksha kaksh main keval ek maheen kagaz le jane kii anumati hoti he, jab tak ki pariksha kendra dwaara ise uplabdh na karaayaa jaae
 haalanki, aise niyam na sirf GRE balki sabhi ucch jokhim vaali parikshaon ke liye praasangik hote hai
 Critics have claimed that computer-adaptive methods may discourage some test takers, as the difficulty of the question varies with performance
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi pariksha dene vaale vyakti ko pariksha ke bich main ullekhneey rup se aasaan prashn die jate hai, to ve yah nishkarsh nikaal sakate hai ki unka pradarshan acha nahin ho rahaa he, jo pariksha jari rahane ke saath unki kshamta ko prabhavit karegaa, bhale hi prashn ki kathinaayee vyaktiparak ho
 iske vipareet, maanak pariksha paddatiyaan chaatro ko aarambh main adhik kathin vishay dekar chaatro ko hatotsahit kar sakati hai
 Critics have also stated that over-emphasizing many of the early questions is biased against computer-adaptive examiners who typically end up with exams or stress at the beginning of the exam due to the stress or confusion of being in a more comfortable position
 Perform poorly
 avashya hi maanak nishchit-rup vaali parikshaon ko bhi un chaatro ke khilaaf "pakshpatpurna" kaha jaataa he jinamein pariksha dene kii kam shakti hoti he kyonki samaan str kii parishuddhta praapt karne ke liye unhen ek samakaksh computer lambaai anukuli pariksha ke dugune samay kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Like other entrance exams, the GRE is subject to criticisms of racial bias
 1998 main Journal of Blacks in Higher Education ne yah dhyaan diya ki 1996 main ashwet parikshaarthiyon kaa ausat prapthank maukhik khand main 389 tha, ganitiya khand main 409 tha or vishleshnatmak khand main 423 tha, jabaki shwet parikshaarthiyon ke ausat prapthank kramash: 496, 538 or 564 the
 Note that only the difference in normal average score does not provide evidence of bias unless the populations are similar in abilities and to emphasize that differences in group scores are direct evidence of a bad test is an extreme condition
 ek adhik prabhavi, sweekrut or anubhavjanya drushtikon pariksha kii bhedakar kaarividhi kaa vishleshan he, jo upasamoohon ke liye vastu pratikraya vakr main antaron kii pariksha karata he; iske liye sabase acha drushtikon DFIT ruparekha he
 There is also a bias towards students who have the financial resources to attend privately owned test-taking classes
 in kakshaon se aam taur par behatar prapthank praapt hote hai; tathaapi, aisi kai companiyaan or shikshak is baat par adhik dhyaan kendrit karte hai ki kis prakaar se kisi ke laabh ke liye pariksha ke praaroop kaa upyog kiya jaae or vastav main isliye nahin ki pariksha se sambandhit saamagree ko kaise siikhaa jaae
 gres are criticized for not measuring whether a student will be successful in graduate school
 Robert Sternberg of Tufts University claimed that the GRE general exam was a weak predictor of success in graduate studies in psychology
 durbal pragsuchakataa kaa daawa GRE saamaanya pariksha ke ganit bhaag se sambandhit ho sakati he kyonki unnat aankadon ko samajhane main ganit kii ek acchhee aadharshila mahatvapurn he
 However, in some branches of psychology, data usage is minimal
 ETS ne ek report prakashit kiya jo snaatak str par ek chaatr ke mulya suchakank par GRE kaa pragsuchak maan bataata he
 As i mentioned earlier, the recognition coefficient ranges between 
30 and 
45 between the GRE and the first year and overall undergraduate GPA

 The ETS assured investigators that it was using multiple sets of questions and that the exam was safe
 baad main yah galat paaya gaya
 In December 1994, inspired by students notifying recurring questions, Kaplan, former director of the corporate and Newton's current chief executive, Jose Ferreira, led a team of 22 employees stationed in 9 US cities to take the exam 
 kaplan, inkorporate ne phir GRE ke 70-80% hisse ko vyakt karne vaale 150 prashn ETS ko saunp die
 aarambhik samachar vijyapti ke anusaar, suraksha sambandhi samasya kii pahchaan karne ke liye ETS stenle ech kaplan ke prati kritagya mahasoos hua
 However, on December 31, ETS filed a federal electronic communications privacy act, a lawsuit against Kaplan, Inc
 for copyright laws, breach of contract, and fraud, and a confidentiality agreement was signed by the examinees on the day of the exam
 2 janvari 1995 ko adaalat ke baahar ek samjhauta hua
 Additionally, in 1994, the numerical algorithm for computer adaptive form was found to be unsafe
 ETS ne yah sweekaar kiya ki jose farera ke netritv main kaplan, inkorporate ke karmchaariyon ne GRE ank kalan vidhi kii pramukh visheshtaon ko khandit kar diya

 In the year 2006, ETS announced plans to introduce significant changes in the format of the GRE
 Changes planned for the revised GRE included longer time for exams, withdrawal from computer-adaptive exams, a new grading scale, and reasoning skills for both mathematical and qualitative classes, and an increased focus on critical thinking
 2 april 2007 ko ETS ne GRE main sanshodhan karne kii yojana ko radd karne ke nirnay kii ghoshnaa kii
 is ghoshnaa ne niojit parivartan ko radd karne kaa spashtikaran dete hue nayi pariksha main spasht or samaan pahunch pradaan karne kii kshamta ke prati chintaa jataai
 tathaapi, unhone kaha ki ki ve "bhavishya main pariksha sambandhi saamagree kii vishay vastu main niojit sudhaar ko karyanvit karne" kii yojana bana rahe hai, haalanki un parivartanon ke sambandh main sahi-sahi vivaranon kii ghoshnaa abhi tak nahin kii gayi he
 Changes to the GRE came into effect from 1 November 2007 as ETS began to include new types of questions in the exam
 The change focuses mostly on "fill in the blanks" type answers for the mathematics and vocabulary sections, in which the candidate has to fill in the blanks directly instead of choosing from a multiple-choice list for answers
 vartmaan main ETS ganitiya or shabd sangrah khand prayek main in nae prakaar ke do prashnon kii shuruyaat karne kii yojana bana rahaa he, jabaki bahusankhyak prashn niyamit praaroop main prastut kiye jaayenge
 In January 2008, reading comprehension in the oral section has been reformatted as a citation
 "uddharanon ko padhane main chaatro ko aasaani se upyukt jaankaree praapt karne main madad karne" ke liye "aavashyaktaa padane par uddharanon main vishesh jaankaree ke prati parikshaarthi dwaara dhyaan kendrit karne hetu use chihnankit kiya jayega
 Prior to October 2002, the GRE had a separate Analytical Aptitude section that tested candidates in logical and analytical reasoning ability

 Although Kalidas composed the story of Rama, in this story he did not raise any one character as a hero
 unhone apni kriti ‘raghuvansh’ main puure vansh kii katha rachi, jo dilip se armbh hoti he or agnivarn par samaapt hoti he
 After the coronation of his pregnant wife posthumously after Agnivarna, this epic is celebrated
 raghuvansh par sabase pracheen uplabdh tikaa 10veen shatabdi ke kashmiri kavi vallabhdev kii he
 But the most famous commentary is 'sanjeevani', composed by Mallinath

Critics have considered Kalidasa's best epic 'raghuvansh'
 aadi se ant tak isamen nipun kavi kaa vilakshan kaushal vyakt hota he
 Beginning with the austere life of Dileep and Sudakshina, this poem reveals one story of the chastity, valor, sacrifice and tenacity of the Raghuvanshi kings respectively, and the poem ends with the luxury of sensual agni and their elimination
 dilip or sudakshina kaa tap:put aacharan, vartantu ke shishy kuts or raghu kaa samvaad, indumati swayamvar, ajavilap, ram or sita kii vimaanayatra, nirvasit sita kii tejaswita, sangamavarnan, ayodhya nagari kii shoonyata aadi kaa chitra ek ke baad ek ubharta jaataa he or pathak vimugdh bana hua manoyog se unako dekhtaa jaataa he
 In spite of the aggregation of many stories, in this epic, the poet has coordinated them with each other in a way that communicates the natural flow in them
 'raghuvansh' ke anek nripatiyon kii is jyotit nakshatramala main kavi ne adikavi valmiki ke mahimashali ram ko tejaswita or garima pradaan kii he
 The vivacity of the narratives, the naturalness of the incoming passages, the melody of the style and 'raghuvansh' are unique in Sanskrit verses in terms of emotion and language

 While presenting the series of similes at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna, describing their flow of mixed waters, the poet has finally adorned Shiva's body as well as her beauty and thus the beauty Removed from the border and handed it to Anant- kalidas mukhyat: komal or romantic bhaavon ke abhivyanjak kavi he
 That is why the gentle, captivating and sweet side of nature is also written in his work

 At this point, a lion wants to make Nandini his meal
 dilip apane aap ko arpit kar singh se prarthana karte hai ki unhen vah apana aahaar banaaye
 Singh accepts the prayer and swings to kill them
 is chalaang ke saath hi singh ojhal ho jaataa he
 Nandini then tells that she created this illusion to take Dilip's test
 nandini dilip kii seva se prasann hokar putr prapti kaa aashirwad detii he
 Raja Dileep and Sudakshina receive the milk of Nandini and they receive the son Ratna
 is gunwan putr kaa naam raghu rakhaa jaataa he jiske parakram ke kaaran hi is vansh ko raghuvansh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Kalidasa has described Raghu's might in detail in his book 'raghuvansh'
 ashwamedh yajna ke ghode ko churaane par unhone indra se yuddh kiya or use chhudaakar laayaa tha
 He had donated all his wealth after completing the Vishwajit Yagya
 jab unke paas kuch bhi dhan nahin rahaa, to ek din rishiputra kuts ne aakar unase 14 crores swarna mudraaen maangi taaki ve apni guru dakshina de saken
 Raghu made up his mind to make offerings to Kubera to satisfy this Brahmin
 yah soochna paakar kuber ghabaraaya or khud hi unka khazaana bhar diya
 Raghu handed over the entire treasure to the Brahmin; But that Brahminputra accepted only 14 crore currencies
 raghu ke putr aj bhi bade parakramee hue
 He went to Vidarbha princess Indumati's swayamvara and made her his wife
 kalidas ne is swayamvar kaa sundar varnan ‘raghuvansh’ main kiya he
 Raghu, seeing Aj's coronation, handed over his throne to him and took Vanaprastha
 raghu kii tarah aj bhi ek kushal raja bane
 He loved his wife Indumati very much
 ek baar naradji prasannchitt apni veena liye akaash main vichar rahe the
 Coincidentally, one flower of her veena was broken and fell on the head of queen Indumati, who was walking in the garden, which led to her death
 raja aj indumati ke viyog main vihval ho gaye or ant main jal-samadhi le lee

 iskaa bada hi sundar evam maarmik drushtaant kalidas ne ‘raghuvansh’ ke terahaven sarg main kiya he
 This canto shows how deep the geographical information of Kalidas was
 ayodhya kii purv khyaati or vartmaan sthiti kaa varnan kush ke swapn ke madhyam se kavi ne bady kushalta se solahaven sarg main kiya he
 The last canto depicts the enjoyment of the last king Agnivarna of Raghuvansh
 raja ke dambh kii paraakaashtha yah he ki janata jab raja ke darshan ke liye aati he to agnivarn apane pair khidki ke baahar pasaar detaa he
 Disrespect of the public results in the decline of the state and thus a glorious lineage is also celebrated
 kalidas jaanate the ki ram kii katha kaa utkarsh valmiki kii ramayana se ho gaya tha or uske baad jo bhi likhaa jayega uskaa juuthan hi hoga
 That is why instead of making Rama a hero in his poetry, he presented Raghuvansh as the narrator; In which all the characters had their respective roles - depending on their character xxrep 4 
 some excellent and some bad
 raghuvansh kaa naam unke parakramee or adarsh raajaaon ke naam se hi chalata rahegaa

 The Vajasravas king once donated all the wealth in the form of Dakshina as a Vishwajit Yajna

 inke liye koi niyantrankarta bhi nahin rahata, at: inaki kriyasheeltaa main baadha nahin padati
 The guerrilla army usually defends itself by having a strong army attack them
 unhen apni buddhi vishesh vi·sa rahata he
 For their safety, they keep a system of information providers
 chhapamar yuddh kaa uddeshy he shatru kii niyamit sena kaa prabhaav ghataana
 In order to fulfill this objective well, they work behind the enemy
 saath hi bade paimaane par kiye janevaale niyamit sena ke kaaryon main bhi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 The soldiers of the guerrillas do not remain soldiers
 ve rail, yatayaat, rasad, pul or isi ke anya sadhano ko bhi kshati pahunchaate hai, jo shatruon kii niyamit sena kaaryon main baadha daal saken
 There are three main items for the partisan wars
 pehali chhapamar ke kaary ke liye upyukt bhubhag, duusari raajnneetik avasthaa or teen vastu he rashtriya paristhitiyaan
 The most suitable for this type of work is the hilly land, which has a forest, or a similar plot full of forests and marshes
 chhapamar yuddh se raksha ke liye chhapamaron dwaara prayukt aniyamit vidhiyon kaa gyaan aavashyak he jisase sahakaari prayatnon dwaara unke prayatnon ko turant nasht kar diya jaay
 Another particularly useful method is to surround the area in which the guerrillas rest
 pratham vishwayuddh main europe main lambey morache lagate the
 This area is not particularly attractive for the partisans, but the Arab revolt of 1916-18 was quite irregular
 karnal tii
i
 larens ne arab kii sena ke sahyog se chhapamari ke jo kaary kiye ve ullekhneey hai
 The rhetoric of the Middle East had two weaknesses, first, the unrest between the people or the Arabs, and the second, the fractious and weak communication system governing the Ottoman Empire
 larens or unke sahaayak arabon ne turk gadhon se bachate hue rail kii line kaat deen, akramanon se turkon ko pareshaan kiya or unhen aage badhane se roak diya
 Now from the other side, the regular English forces stationed in Jordan attacked the main Ottoman army
 idhar larens ne apni sena kii sahaayta se is turki sena kaa anya senaaon se sambandh viched kar diya
 The reasons for Lawrence's success were the mobility of his army, external aid, time and public opinion, which helped the civilians
 is prakaar chhapamaron ko vijay mili
 a classic example of a partisan war was seen before the start of the Second World War
 japaniyon ne chiniyon par akraman kar diya
 In 1937 AD, Chinese forces evacuated the cities and retreated themselves
 china ke logon ko america se shastr or gola barood mila
 With the help of which they harassed the enemy army for a long time and separated the small troops from the main army and destroyed it
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main chhapamari ke liye vistrut kshetra mila
 The conquest of the Germans in Europe and the Japanese in south-east Asia took place so quickly and over a wide area that there was no good governance in the conquered territories
 sainikon ne jaise hi ek sthaan par vijay pai, unhen sahasaa aage bad jane kii ajna mili
 The conquered territories had to be left to the right of small military parties
 chhapamari ke liye ye kshetra adarsh sthal ban gaye or sheeghra hi shatru dalon ke bikhare hue sanchaar kshetron ko safaltaapurvak nasht kar diya gaya
 In North Africa, Italian forces initially occupied large areas and severely crushed the inhabitants there
 yahan kaa janamat italy ke vipareet ho gaya
 The British took advantage of this sentiment and successfully assisted guerrilla wars with the help of the indigenous people
 italy ke faujee daston kii sanchaar vyavastha, hawaii adde, petrol, gola barood ke bhandar, motor yatayaat aadi bangaji se mistra kii seemaa tak faile hue the
 Infantry or jeeps fitted with appropriate weapons were particularly suitable for these guerrilla soldiers
 chhapamar shatrudal ke lakshyon par raatri main akraman karte the
 In the spring of 1941, the Germans annexed Yugoslavia
 desh ke adhikrut hone ke pashchaat hi josip vrozovik kii adhyakshata main vahaan ke logon ne ek chhapamar dal banaaya jo shatru sena ke viruddh kaary karata tha
 The need of arms was met by the people there, or the weapons snatched from the enemy
 germany or italy kii sainik tukadiyon ore unke addon par akraman karke inhone yuddh kaa saamaan praapt kiya
 Their number also increased with success
 san 1943 i
 ke ant tak yah sankhya lagbhag 1,50,000 ho gai
 This power spread throughout Yugoslavia and was especially situated in forests and mountains
 sanchaar vyavastha, jahaan tak sambhav ho saktaa tha, shatru dal se chhine gaye radio seton se chalati thi
 The objective of this group of Yugoslavia was to attack the enemy's accomplished targets that were weak and where the least expected attack occurred
 iske atirikt kisi bhi avasthaa main ve aisa avasar nahin dena chaahate the ki shatru unpar pratyakraman kar saken
 Tito's advocates depended on citizens for supplies, shelter and information
 sabhi chhapamar yudhon main nagarikon kaa vyavhaar atyant mahatv kaa hota he
 They were punished for the assistance the citizens had provided to the guerrillas
 sahastron purush, striyaan or bachche maut ke ghat utaar die gaye
 Thousands of villages were looted and burnt down
 teen varsh kii avadhi main shatrudal ne saat baar chhapamaron ko nasht karne ke liye akraman kiye or vayusena kaa bhi sahaara liya, kintu prayek baar tito ke pakshaavlambee kisi na kisi prakaar batch gaye or dhuree raashtra par aise sthaan par akraman karne ke liye phir prakat hue jahaan unke akraman kii aashaa nahin kii ja sakati thi
 Yugoslavia is a proof of what results can be achieved with the cooperation of the modern air force and the guerrillas
 roosiyon kii safalataa main shatrudal kii sanchaar vyavastha par chhapamaron ke akraman kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 By relating to the public, they got a great means of getting information about the bases of the Germans and the activity of their army
 unki gatishiltaa, sthanon kaa gyaan, apratyaashit akraman or yudhakshetra se alag alag tukadiyon kaa alag alag waapas hona shatrudal ko bhram main daalane or pareshaan karne ke saadhan bane
 In 1941, Japan declared war
 isse england or sanyukt raashtra donon ke saamne badi badi samasyaayen aa garin
 The battlefield now became very wide and in the first stage of the war it became impossible to manage the items needed for such a long defense line
 philippine main niyukt sanyuktaraashtra ke general duglas macarthar us kshetra main kai varsh rah chuke the
 They arranged a guerrilla army against the Japanese
 unhone adhikariyon ke kai chote chote dal is tapu main bikher die
 These officers were well acquainted with this area
 inkaa kaam japani sena se bachakar chhapamari karnaa tha
 There were a maximum of 15 persons in each team, including people skilled in technical communication etc
 inkaa mukhya kaary gupt samachar praapt karnaa or unhen preshit karnaa tha
 Their second task was to obstruct Japanese control established in the country
 in dalon ke fail jane ke baad dalon main parsparik sanchaar kii vyavastha main kathinaayee hone lagi
 To overcome this difficulty, the guerrillas used small radio sets of the public
 baad main san 1942 i
 main general macarthar ke austrailia sthit mukhya karyaalay se chhapamar tukadiyon kaa sidhaa radiyon sambandh sthapit ho gaya
 Soon there was a regular arrangement for sending submarines, and by April 1944 all major islands had established radio contact with General macarthur
 sheeghra hi vibhinn dwipon par senaayen utaarne kii yojana bani
 The task of the guerrillas was to obtain secret information and to find targets for the United Nations Army
 is prakaar chhapamaron ke dwaara kiye gaye jasusi ke kaaryo se general macarthar ko is kshetra ko punarjaagrath karne or apane kaaryon kii yojana banane main mahatvapurn sahaayta mili
 In February 1943, General Aiden C
 Winget, by mules and oxen, crossed the Chindbin and Irawadi rivers with 3,000 soldiers, reaching the backdrop of the Japanese forces stationed in Burma
 yahan inhone japani sanchaar vyavastha bigaadi, shastron ke bhandar nasht kar die or japaniyon dwaara bharat par honevaale akraman main baadha daali
 Radio sets were given by airplanes to their inner-most parties, known as Chindwin
 isi varsh angrejon ne burma main kechin jati ko chhapamari ke liye sanyojit kiya
 He was trained to use radio sets
 ye log shatrusena ke peeche adhik samay tak tik saken iske liye us kshetra main sahaytaprad vaataavaran kii bhi sristi kii gai
 After the second revolt, Asian countries like Malaya, India, etc
 also became good areas for raiding
 june, san 1950 i
 main korea main jo sangharsh vyapak ho gaya usamen atyant aadhunik shastron se sajjit niyamit sena ke viruddh chhapamari atyant prabhaavshaalee siddh hui
 Here communist guerrillas were taught to protect themselves from their superior powers
 choti tukadiyon dwaara shighratapurna akraman karne teji ke saath peeche hatane, teetar bitar ho jane or pun: ekatra hone par vishesh bal diya gaya
 The main parts of raids were direct attack and covert attack
 10 hajaar se 20 hajaar tak kii jansankhyawaale nagaron par san 1956 i
 tak akraman hote rahe
 Between 50 and 300 people lived in the aggressive parties
 akraman krmanusaar do dalon kii sahaayta se hota tha
 The first contingent would reach the offensive zone and disperse after completing its task
 duusari tukdi ke palaayan ke samay pehali tukdi uski raksha karti
 Returning would always be by some other route, crossing the mountains or a big river
 yuddh or prachaar ke hetu shatru paksh ko pareshaan bhi kiya jaataa tha, jisase shatrusena kaa naitik patan ho jaay
 It has been proved that the principles of guerilla warfare are the same today as in the early times of war
 aaj bhi chhapamar teevr gati se chalate hai, dhokhaa dekar shatrudal par vahaan akraman karte hai jahaan vah sabase adhik durbal hota he
 Also, they do not give the enemy an opportunity to retaliate
 yuddh main prayukt honevaale shastron, saaj saamaanon, sainik sthapanon aadi vyavasthaaon kii bhedyata ke saath saath hi, jinaki sahaayta se shighratapurvak akraman yaa antadhrvans sambhav he, chhapamaron kaa kshetra bhi badhata ja rahaa he
 Also, the importance of this type of war has increased in modern warfare
 sunirdhaarit lakshya or yudhkaushal kii paramaavashyak shrunkhalaaon ke vinaash dwaara shatru ke akraman kii sari yojanaon ko vifal banaaya ja saktaa he
 Geographical conditions also hold their special importance and a convenient field is very important for raiding
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main morachon ke sheeghra badhane ke falswaroop chhapamaron ke shatrusena main pravesh kii sambhaavnaayen bad garin or kahin kahin to niyamit sena kii tukadiyaan tak shatrudal ke prishthbhag par pahunch gai
 Now, the field of guerrilla work that can be done with the cooperation of guerrillas and citizens has become very vast
 is prakaar ke yudhon main janata kii sahaayta or shubhechha praapt karnaa anivaary ban gaya he
 These two inventions, radio and aircraft, revolutionized the partisan war
 jahaan chhapamaron ko in sadhano se sahaayta praapt karne kaa maarg khulaa vahaan ye upkaran unka peechha karne ke kaam bhi aane lage
 Nevertheless, there was more profit than loss
 pehle chhapamaron ko apane saathiyon ke samachar kabhi kabhi hi mil pate the, kintu ab laghu vahneey preshkon kii sahaayta se unhen icchaanusaar apane saathiyon se sampark sthapit karne kii suvidha mil gai
 Then the task of unloading, taking them, strengthening their power and making them available for supply and other items of strategic importance also took place by aircrafts, raids and all other irregular armies
 chhapamaron kaa pramukh kaary he shatrusena ko unke prishthbhag se milane vaali saamagree kaa vinaash karnaa
 The strategic policy will change in view of the development of nuclear weapons
 senaayen choti choti tukadiyon main vibhajit hongi
 Decentralization of supply sources, war bases, industries and other strategic systems will be necessary
 falswaroop, yadi aanvik shakti kaa prayog hua, to chhapamaron ke lakshya aakaar main chote or sangrakshan adhik ho jaayange
 The result will be that the area of raiding will become larger and more effective
 niyamit sena bhi choti choti tukadiyon main yuddh karegi
 Under these circumstances, only partisan wars will be successful
 yah kahana anuchit na hoga ki yuddh main aanvik shastron kaa prayog hone par keval chhapamar yuddh hi pramukh mahatv kaa hoga or anya vidhiyon kaa saadhaaran upyog hi rah jaayga
