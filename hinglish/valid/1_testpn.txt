 Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' was born on the Magh Shukla 11, Samvat 1955, 21 February 1899 accordingly, in the Mahishadal princely state of Bengal
 vasant panchami par unka janmdin manaane kii parampara 1930 main prarambh hui
 He was born on Tuesday

 His father Pandit Ramshay Tiwari was a resident of Unnao and worked as a soldier in Mahishadal
 ve mul rup se uttar pradesh ke unnav jile ke gadhacola naamak gaanv ke nivasee the
 Nirala was educated up to high school
 baad main hindi sanskrit or bangla kaa swatantra adhyayan kiya
 In the beginning, Nirala got acquainted with the inconveniences and humiliation of his father's small job
 unhone dalit-shoshit kisaan ke saath hamadardi kaa sanskaar apane abodh man se hi arjeet kiya
 The mother died at the age of three and by the age of twenty, the father died
 apane bacchon ke alaava sanyukt parivaar kaa bhi boj niraala par padaa
 In the epidemic that spread after the first World War, not only wife Manohara Devi, but also uncle, brother and sister-in-law died
 shesh kunbe kaa boj uthaane main mahishadal kii naukari aparyaapt thi
 All his life after this was spent in financial struggle
 niraala ke jivan kii sabase vishesh baat yah he ki kathin se kathin paristhitiyon main bhi unhone siddhant tyagkar samjhaute kaa rasta nahin apanaaya, sangharsh kaa saahas nahin ganvaaya
 The latter part of life was spent in Allahabad
 vahiin daraganj muhalle main sthit raysahab kii vishaal kothi ke thik peeche bane ek kamare main 15 oktober 1961 ko unhone apni igalila samaapt kii
 The first appointment of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' took place in the Mahishadal state itself
 unhone 1918 se 1922 tak yah naukari kii
 He then moved to editing, independent writing and translation work
 1922 se 1923 ke dauraan kolkata se prakashit 'samanvay' kaa sampadan kiya, 1923 ke agast se matvaala ke sampadak mandal main kaary kiya
 He was then appointed to the Ganga Book Mala office in Lucknow, where he remained associated with the institution's monthly magazine Sudha till mid-1935
 1935 se 1940 tak kaa kuch samay unhone lakhanu main bhi bitaayaa
 After this, he lived in Allahabad till 1942 and did independent writing and translation work
 unki pehali kavita janmabhumi prabhaa naamak masik patr main june 1920 main, pehla kavita sangrah 1923 main anamika naam se, tathaa pehla niabandh bang bhashaa kaa uccharan oktober 1920 main masik patrika saraswati main prakashit hua
 Unlike other poets of his contemporary, he has taken little recourse to imagination in poetry and has portrayed reality prominently
 ve hindi main muktchand ke pravartak bhi maane jate hai
 In the role of his poetry collection Parimal published in 1930, he writes - niraala ne 1920 i0 ke aasapaas se lekhan kaary aarambh kiya
 His first composition was a song written on 'janmabhoomi'
 lambey samay tak niraala kii pratham rachana ke rup main prasiddh 'juhi kii kali' sheershak kavita, jiskaa rachanakaal niraala ne swayan 1916 i0 batalaaya tha, vastutah 1921 i0 ke aasapaas likhi gayi thi tathaa 1922 i0 main pehali baar prakashit hui thi
 Apart from poetry, Nirala has written in a tremendous amount in other genres of narrative and prose
 niraala rachanawali naam se 8 khandon main purv prakashit evam aprakashit sampoorn rachanaaon kaa suniyojit prakaashan The greatest feature of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' poetry is the skill of illustration
 aantarik bhav ho yaa bahya jagat ke drishy-rup, sangitatmak dhvaniyaan ho yaa rang or gandh, sajiv charitra hon yaa prakritik drishy, sabhi alag-alag laganevaale tattvon ko ghulaa-milakar niraala aisa jeevant chitra upasthit karte hai ki padhane vaala un chitron ke madhyam se hi niraala ke marm tak pahunch saktaa he
 Nirala's paintings not only contain her emotion, but also her thinking
 isliye unki bahut-si kavitaaon main darshanik gaharaai utpann ho jaati he
 Due to this new illustration skill and philosophical depth, often Nirala's poems become somewhat complicated, which the thinkers accuse them of rigor etc
 as they do not understand
 unke kisaan-bodh ne hi unhen chhayavaad kii bhoomi se aage badhkar yatharthwaad kii nai bhoomi nirmit karne kii prerana di
 Seeing special situations, characters and scenes, recognizing their heart and making those specific objects the subject of illustration is a notable feature of Nirala's realism
 niraala par aadhyatmavaad or rahasyavaad jaisi jivan-vimukh pravritiyon kaa bhi asar he
 Due to this effect, they often dream of conquering miracles and ending conflicts
 niraala kii shakti yah he ki ve chamatkaar ke bharose akarmanya nahin baith jate or sangharsh kii vaastavik chunauti se ankhen nahin churaate
 In some cases, mysticism goes against the unique real life experiences
 har ore prakaash failaa he, jivan alokamay mahaasaagar main dub gaya he, ityadi aisi hi baaten hai
 But this mysticism is not permanent in the sense of the infrequent, it proves to be fleeting
 anek baar niraala shabdon, dhvaniyon aadi ko lekar khilwaad karte hai
 It is difficult to call these players art
 lekin saamanyat: ve in khilvaadon ke madhyam se bade chamatkaarpurn kalatmak prayog karte hai
 The specialty of these experiments is that they are helpful in expressing the subject or emotion more effectively
 niraala ke prayogon main ek vishesh prakaar ke saahas or sajagata ke darshan hote hai
 It is this courage and awareness that makes Nirala different and special among poets of his era

 In simple words, Baikunth Dham is the world of Lord Vishnu

 He who reaches here does not come again in the womb because he attains salvation

 Baikunth is a place of spiritual feeling rather than a place
 jise baikuntha dham janaa ho, uske liye gyaan hi ummid kii kiran he
 With this, he becomes one with the form of God
 lekin jiske bheetar param gyaan he, bhagwaan ke prati anany bhakthi he, ve hi baikuntha pahunch sakate hai
 On the other hand, if you find the meaning of Baikuntha for human life, Baikunta literally means - where there is no frustration
 kuntha yani niskriyata, akarmanyata, niraashaa, hataasha, aalasy or daridrata
 This means that Baikunth Dham is a place where there is no lawlessness, no inaction
 vyaavhaarik jivan main bhi jis sthaan par niskriyata nahin hoti us sthaan par raunak hoti he
 The names of Baikuntha are Vishnulok, Vaikunthadham, Vaikuntha Sagar etc

 It connects New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling Himalayan Railway
 yah kolkata-silligudi maarg or haldibari slip kii ek pramukh train he
 All connections to North Bengal during the British period were through East Bengal
 1878, kolkata se silligudi tak kaa rail maarg do charano main tha
 In the first phase, a 185 km journey from Calcutta station to Damukdih Ghat, which falls on the southern bank of Padma River and was on the East Bengal State Railway

 darjeeling mail vibhaajan se pehle ke dinon main is maarg pe daudti thi
 This path continued even after a few years after the partition of India
 yah assam mail se judati thi jo vibhaajan se pehle ke dinon main guwahati se santahar tak jaati thi
 With the partition of India in 1947, the biggest obstacle in connecting Kolkata and Siliguri was that there was no bridge across the Ganges, in West Bengal or Bihar
 silligudi ke liye ek aam taur par sweekaarya maarg sahibganj loop or sacrugali tha kabhi kabhi sahibganj ghat se bhi tha
 a more radical change was made in the 1960s when the Farakka barrage was being constructed
 bhartiya railway ne kolkata se ek nai broad gej rail link banaaya jo new jalpaigudi ko jodta tha
 The 2,240 meter long Farakka Barrage connects both the banks of the Ganges and it was also a road with a railroad

 Egyptian measurements are streamlined on this standard, but actual measurement rad and equipment can vary up to one millimeter per cubit
 For longer distances the Egyptians used a minute of march of 350 royal cubits and an atur or itrw of 21,000 royal cubits

 Ices: Arun, or Uranus, is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system
 vyas ke aadhaar par yah saura mandal kaa teesraa bada or dravyaman ke aadhaar par chauthaa bada grah he
 It is 14
5 times heavier than Earth in mass and 63 times larger than Earth in shape
 ausat rup main dekha jaae to prithvi se bahut kam ghanaa he - kyonki prithvi par pathar or anya baari padaarth adhik pratishat main hai jabaki arun par gas adhik he
 That is why it is only four and a half to fourteen times heavier than the earth, despite having a size of three to three times larger than the earth
 haalanki arun ko bina doorabeen ke aankh se bhi dekha ja saktaa he, yah itnaa dur he or itani madhyam roshni kaa prathit hota he ke pracheen vidwaanon ne kabhi bhi ise grah kaa darja nahin diya or ise ek dur timatimaata tara hi samajha
 On 13 March 1781, William Herschel announced its discovery
 arun doorabeen dwaara paae jane vaala pehla grah tha
 The four planets in our solar system are called gas demons, because they contain mostly gas instead of clay and stone and they are very large in size
 arun iname se ek he - baaki teen brihaspati, shani or varun hai
 Of these, Arun's texture is very similar to Varun
 arun or varun ke vaataavaran main brihaspati or shani ke tulana main barf adhik he - pani kii barf ke atirikt inamen jami hui ammonia or methane gaison kii barf bhi he
 So sometimes astronomers put these two in the category called "icy Gas Monsters"
 saura mandal ke saare grahon main se arun kaa vayumandal sab se thanda paaya gaya he or uskaa nunatam taapmaana -49 calvin dekha gaya he
 Many planets of clouds have been seen in this planet

 It is also believed that if somehow the center of Arun could be seen at its center, snow and stones would be found there
 urenus prayek 84 prithvi varshon main surya kaa ek chakkar lagaataa he
 Its average distance from the Sun is about 3 billion km
 urenus par surya prakaash kii tivrata prithvi par kii tulana main lagbhag 1 / 1400 he
 Its orbital elements were first calculated by pierre-cimon Laplace in 1783
 Over time, discrepancies between predicted and observed orbits began to appear, and in 1841 John Couch Adams first proposed that this difference could be due to the gravitational pull of an invisible planet

 At some latitudes, such as two-thirds of the way from the equator to the South Pole, the visual motifs of the atmosphere move very rapidly and form a complete rotation of the smallest 14 hours
 urenus kaa aksheeya jhukaav 97

 This gives him completely different seasonal changes unlike other major planets

 Near the time of Uranus solstice, one pole is constantly facing the sun while the other pole is beyond

 The orientation of the poles opposite the Sun on the other side of Uranus' orbit is reversed
 prayek dhruv 42 varshon ke aasapaas lagaataar ujaalaa paata he, phir agle 42 varsh andhere main gujaarta he
 Near the time of the equinoxes, the sun is in front of the equinox of Uranus and gives a time period of day-night cycles, similar to that seen in most other planets
 urenus apane sabase haal ke vishuv par 7 disambar 2007 ko pahunchaa | One consequence of this axial tilt is that, in the mean period of the year, Uranus's polar regions receive a larger share of the energy invested from the Sun than its equatorial regions
 phir bhi urenus, apane dhruvon par kii tulana main apni bumadhyarekha par zyada tapt he
 The underlying mechanism responsible for this is unknown
 uranus ke asaamaanya dhuriy jhukaav kaa kaaran bhi nischitata ke saath gyaat nahin he, lekin hameshaa kii tarah atakalein yah he ki soramandal nirmaan ke dauraan, ek prithvi ke aakaar kaa aadigrah uranus ke saath takaraayaa or is visham abhivinyas kaa kaaran bana | 1986 main voager 2 ke gujaarey ke samay uranus kaa dakshin dhruv takreeban sidhe surya kii ore tha
 Its pole uses a definition supported by the recent International Astronomical Union for identification as "south", despite the planet's direction of rotation
 arthath ki grah yaa upgrah kaa uttari dhruv vah dhruv hoga jo soramandal ke avikari tal ke upar kii ore hoga
 Sometimes a different convention is used, in which the north and south poles of a body are defined according to the south-hand rule with respect to the direction of rotation

 This value indicates that it is mainly composed of different types of ice, such as water, ammonia, and methane
 The overall amount of ice in the interior of Uranus is not known properly, different figures emerge according to the model's selection, it should be between 9
3 and 13
5 of the Earth's mass
 Hydrogen and helium make up only a small part of the composite
 The remaining non-ice content is composed of rocky material

 There may be a layer of ionized water, where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deep beneath it is dissolved water, in which oxygen crystallizes, but the hydrogen ions within the lattice structure of oxygen Roams freely haalanki model yathochit maanak ke upar kaa mana gaya, par yah adwitiya nahin he, anya model bhi avlokanon ko santusht karte he
 For example, if sufficient amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, then the total amount of ice in the inner part will be reduced and similarly the amount of rocks and hydrogen will increase
 Currently available data does not allow science to determine which model is correct
 uranus kii taral padaarth yukt aantarik sanrachana kaa matlab he ki isaki koi thos sataha nahin he

075 w / m 2
 urenus ke tropapaus main darj hua nimnatam taapmaana 49 kelvin he, jo urenus ko soramandal main sabase thanda grah banaata he
 One hypothesis for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a giant impact body, most of Uranus' proto heat was ejected, releasing that heat with an expired core temperature
 Another hypothesis is that some kind of barrier exists in the upper layers of Uranus which prevents the heat of the core from reaching the surface

 According to the popular folklore in Lokmanas, there is a legend about the goldsmith caste that when Parashurama started annihilating the Kshatriyas one by one in the Treta Yuga, a Saraswat Brahmin saved two Rajput brothers and for some time
 Both of them were told to be madras, one of whom learned how to make jewelery from gold metal and became a goldsmith and the other brother realized the danger and became a Khatri
 Placed themselves not concerned in bread daughter to take an idea that's ears-ears that are both Kshatriya

 In the Vedic Dev-tradition, Vishnu's place is secondary to the numerical point of view of the Suktas because his eulogy is performed in only 5 Suktas; But if they are not looked at from a numerical point of view and consider them from other aspects, then their importance comes out very high
 rugveda main unhen 'brihachharir', yuvakumar aadi visheshnon se khyapit kiya gaya he
 The nature and characteristics of Vishnu mentioned in the Rigveda can be observed in the following points: - vishnu kii anupam visheshta unke teen paad-prakshep hai, jinka rugveda main baarah baar ullekh miltaa he
 Probably this is his biggest feature
 unke teen pad-kram madhu se paripurna kahe gayi hai, jo kabhi bhi ksheen nahin hote
 His three rankings are so elaborate that entire folk exist in them
 ‘tredha vichkramanh’ bhi prakaaraantar se unke teen paad-prakshepon ko dhvanit karata he
 The terms 'uruguay' and 'urukram' are also reflective of the said fact
 madhu se aapurit unke teen pad-kram main se do drushtigochar hai, teesraa sarvatha agochar
 This third highest position has been called the flight of birds and beyond the mortal eye
 yask ke purvavarti shakpuni in teen paad-prakshepon ko brahmand ke teen bhaagon-- prithvi, antariksh or dhuloak main surya kii sanchaar gati ke pratik maanate hai
 Yasak's predecessor Aurnavabha considers him to be the covenant of the rising of the sun, the position in the mid-day and the setting
 tilak mahoday inase varsh ke tridhavibhaajan kaa sanket maanate hai
 If seen, most scholars consider Vishnu to be a sun-vachhi, one of his footprints from midday till midday, second footfall from midnight to midnight and third footfall from postwar to posthumous rise
 inhen purvokt do paad-prakshepon ko drushtigochar or tisare ko agochar kaha gaya he
 But many scholars including mcdanal also say that in this sense how can the third stage be considered as 'supreme'? Therefore, they, like the aforesaid Shakpuni, consider the three steps to be the path through the three worlds of the solar deity
 surya kii kalpana kaa hi samarthan karte hue mcdanal ne vishnu dwaara apane 90 ashwon ke sanchalit kiye jane kaa ullekh kiya he, jinamein se pratye ke chaar-chaar naam hai
 Thus 90 multiplied by 4 numbers means 360 horse, which they consider to be integral since the days of a solar year
 vastutah vishnu ke do padon se sampoorn vishwa kii niyantranaatmakataa tathaa tisare pad se unka param dham arthath unki prapti sanketit he
 In the Rigveda itself, these three verses have been given a mysterious explanation
 isliye is pad ko gyanatmak maanakar rugveda main hi spasht kaha gaya he ki vishnu kaa param pad gyaniyon dwaara hi gyatavya he
 Although Vishnu is also considered to be a resident of Vani, but his most beloved abode, 'path:' is well-known in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan ne ‘giri’ pad ko shlisht maanakar uskaa arth 'vaani' ke saath-saath lakshanik rup main ‘parvat ke samaan unnat lok’ bhi kiya he
 If 'giri' is accepted in both these ways, then the problem is solved
 vishnu kaa teesraa pad jahaan pahunchataa he vahi unka awaas sthaan he
 The world of Vishnu is the 'ultimate post', that is, it is the best form of destination
 us ‘param pad’ kii visheshta yah he ki vah atyadhik prakaash se yukt he
 There cows with many horns transmit there
 ‘gaavah’ yahan shlisht pad kii tarah he
 The meaning of the physical confirmation of milk, etc
, when there is 'cow' meaning from the pun and 'rays', there is a lot of light that is easily permissible for light, that is, spiritual progress
 vishnu ke ‘param pad’ main madhu kaa sthaayee utsa he
 This 'madhu' is also rejoicing to the gods
 is shlisht pad kaa jo bhi arth kiya jaay par vah har sthiti main parmanand kaa vaachak he, jiske liye devtaa sahit samast praani abhilaashi bhi rahete hai or prayatnsheel bhi
 Therefore, everyone wishes for the attainment of the said world
 usee mantra main vahaan punyashalee logon kaa, tripti kaa anubhav karte hue ullekh bhi hua he
 a prominent feature of Vishnu is his friendship with Indra
 indra ke saahchary main hi unke teen paad-prakshepon kaa pravartan hota he
 Together with Indra, he destroys the 99 forts of the Shambar monster
 isi prakaar vah vrutra ke saath sangram main bhi indra kii sahaayta karte hai
 Both have also been described with some other powers
 is prakaar vishnu dwaara sompaan kiya janaa or indra dwaara teen paad-prakshep kiya janaa bhi varnit he
 In the Rigveda, Mandal 6, Sukta 69, there is a homage to the two deities
 isi prakaar rugveda ke mandal 5, sookt 87 main indra ke sahchar marudganon ke saath unki sahastuti praapt hoti he
 The word Vishnu derived from Vishnu Dhatu literally means 'broad, dynamic, functional or enterprising'
 apane bal-vikram ke hi kaaran ve logon dwaara stut hote hai
 They are eternal semen
 is gun ke kaaran hi unhen pratik rup se ‘vrishna’ bhi mana gaya he
 They are the cause of fear of enemies due to their semen or heroic deeds
 unase log usee prakaar bhaybheet rahete hai, jis prakaar kisi parvatachaari singh se
 With the utterances of 'parameshvaradbhiti', etc
, it is proved to fear the common people
 unase bhaybheet hona akaaran nahin he
 They are about to commit acts of violence etc
 yahan yah dhyatavya he ki ve kutsit hinsadikarta kaa hi vadh karte he
 Therefore it has been said for them that they are not murderers
 vishnu visteern, vyapak or apratihat gati vaale hai
 The terms 'urugay' and 'urukram' are a source of this fact
 ‘urugay’ kaa arth acharya sayan dwaara ‘mahjjanon dwaara stuyaman’ athwa ‘prabhutatya stuyaman’ karne se bhi vishnu kii mahima vikhandit nahin hoti
 Dr
 Yadunandan Mishra says that we are urged to make the meaning of this term 'with a wide speed', because it has been said to be a 'transmitter in all worlds'
 unke pad-kram itane sudeergh hote hai ki ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 If the creation of Vishnu's three stanzas, establish and hold them, then they also nurture dependent people there
 logon ko apana bhogy annadi unheen teen pad-kramon ke prasadswarup praapt hota he, jisase ki ve param tripti kaa anubhav kiya karte hai
 Those who praise Vishnu, they always do well, because their eulogy gives them the utmost energy
 is prakaar sphurti-pradaayini stuti vishnu tak pahunchaa paane ke liye sabhi lalayit rahete hai
 They are senior donors
 vishnu ke gunon main bhi trayaatmakataa parilakshith hoti he
 He is of three rank-order, three types of speed, measuring the three worlds and holding the Loktraya
 isi prakaar vah ‘tridhaatu’ arthath sat, raj or tam kaa samikrut rup athwa prithvi, jal or tej se yukt bhi hai
 Vishnu is the creator of earthly regions and the establishment of the most elaborate space etc
 ve swanirmit lokon main teen prakaar kii gati karne vaale hai
 These three movements symbolize their origin, status and merger
 is prakaar jad-jangam sabhi ke ve nirmaataa bhi hai, paalak bhi or vinaashak bhi
 He is the 'sole holder of Loktray'
 ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se akele hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 By measuring Loktraya, it also results that Loktraya means that the entire living beings are under his complete control
 vishnu bhrun-rakshak bhi hai
 Vishnu is prayed to protect the womb seed and the birth of a beautiful child
 unke paalak swaroop par spasht bal dene ke kaaran rugveda main ahoratr agnirup main bhi unhen 'vishnurgopa paraman paati

' arthath sabake rakshak-paalak kaha gaya he
 Acharya Saiyan also clearly considers Vishnu to be 'observant' in the interpretation of the twelfth mantra of the twenty-fifth Sukta of the Eighteenth Circle of the Rigveda
 xxrep 4 
 Therefore, in the overall perspective, Vishnu has been called the supreme benefactor in the Rigveda
 sarvaadhik mantron main varnit hone ke baavjood indra ko 'sukrit' or vishnu ko 'sukruttarah' kaha gaya he
 'sukritarah' has been interpreted by Acharya Sayan as 'the best of those who give good fruit'; Shripad Satavalekar ji has given the meaning 'best among those who do good deeds' and Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati ji has also given the meaning 'ative best deeds
' indra 'sukrit' he to vishnu 'sukruttarah' hai
 The meaning is clear that it is assumed in the Rigveda that Vishnu is supreme
 isi prakaar indra ke raja hone ke baavjood vishnu kii sarvocchata rugveda main hi is baat se bhi spasht ho jaati he ki usamen vishnu ke liye kaha gaya he ki "ve sampoorn vishwa ko akele dhaaran karte hai" tathaa indra ke liye kaha gaya he ki ve rajya karte hai
 The meaning is clear that Vishnu, the creator and foster of the universe, has made Indra the king for operation
 is susandarbhit pariprekshya main vishnu kii sarvocchata se sambaddh brahman granthon evam baad kii puranic manyataayen bhi swatah udbhasith ho uthati hai
 In the Brahmin era, there was a lot of development of yajna-sanstha and with this, the importance of Vishnu in Deomandali became more than before
 aitarey brahman ke armbh main hi yajna main sthaan dene ke kram main agni se armbh kar vishnu ke sthaan ko 'param' kaha gaya he
 Among them is the place of other gods
 is tarah spasht rup se vaidic samhita granthon main sarvapramukh sthaan praapt agni kii apeksha vishnu ko atyucch sthaan diya gaya he
 In fact, Vishnu has been considered great in the Rigveda, but due to the lack of description, his place there is secondary
 brahman granthon main spasht kathan ke dwaara unhen sarvocch pad diya gaya he
 This superiority is also evident from the legend that Vishnu snatched the earth, Veda and Vani from the demons by his three steps and gave it to Indra
 vaidic vishnu ke teen pagon kaa yah brahmanon main kathatmak roopaantaran he; or isi ke saath vishnu kii sarvshereshthata bhi brahman yug main hi spasht ho gayi
 Aitareya Brahmin clearly considers Vishnu as the gatekeeper, the absolute protector of the gods
 rugveda tathaa brahmanon main uplabdh sanketon kaa puraanon main paryaapt parivardhan hua-- kathatmak bhi, vivarnaatmak bhi or vyaakhyaatmak bhi
 The Puranas have referred to Nirmal Parbrahma as Vishnu due to the absence of present, continual, unborn, Akshay, Avayya, Ekras and Hay at the core of this world
 ve 'paraanaa parah', intaraatma main avasthit paramatma, param shreshth tathaa rup, varna aadi nirdeshon tathaa visheshan se rahit hai
 They are devoid of these six vices - birth, growth, result, decay and destruction
 ve sarvatra vyaapt hai or samast vishwa kaa unheen main vaas he; isiilie vidvan unhen 'vasudev' kehete hai
 At a time when there was no day, night, sky, earth, darkness, light and nothing but these, at that time the only head man was Param Brahm, who is not the subject of senses and intellect
 sristi ke armbh main brahma ji ko vishnu ji ne jo mul gyanaswaroop chatupashloki bhagwat sunaaya tha, usamen bhi yahi bhav vyakt hua he -- sristi ke purv keval main hi main tha
 Apart from me, neither was gross nor subtle and neither was the cause of ignorance
 jahaan yah sristi nahin he, vahaan main hi main hoon or is sristi ke rup main jo prathit ho rahaa he, vah bhi main hi hoon or jo kuch batch rahegaa, vah bhi main hi hoon
 In these contexts, the supremacy of Vishnu and the feeling of being a Sarvnarshi is clearly reflected
 mana gaya he ki vishnu ke do rup hue
 The first form is the head man and the second form is 'kaal'
 ye hi donon sristi or pralay ko athwa prakruti or purush ko sanyukt or viyukt karte hai
 This time form God is eternal and eternal; Therefore, the origin, position and catastrophe of the world also never stop
 vaishnavon ke sirmaur tathaa 'puraanon kaa tilak' ke rup main maanya bhagwat mahapurana main sristi kii utpatti ke prasang main kaha gaya he ki sristi karne kii ichha hone par ekarnav main soye vishnu kii naabhi se camel kaa pradurbhaav hua or usamen samast gunon ko abhasith karne vaale swayan vishnu ke hi antaryami rup se pravisht hone se swatah vedamay brahma kaa pradurbhaav hua
 Similarly, in most Puranas, Vishnu has been accepted as the ultimate brahma
 unase sambaddh kathaon se puraana bhare pade hai
 Being a follower, they sometimes have to resort to various traps from the world view
 asuron ke dwaara rajya chin lene par punah swargadhipaty-prapti hetu devataaon ko samudr-manthan kaa paraamarsh dete hue asuron se chal karne kaa suzav dena; tathaa kamoddeepak mohini rup dharankar asuron ko mohit karke devataaon ko amrit pilaanaa; shankhachud ke vadh hetu tulsi kaa satitv bhang karne sambandhi devibhagwat tathaa shivpurana jaise uppuraanon main varnit kathaon main vishnu kaa chal-prapanch drashtavy he
 In this regard, it is important to note that being a follower, they see results
 kinhin varadaanon se asuron / anyaayiyon ke bal-vishisht ho jane ke kaaran yadi chal karke bhi anyaayi kaa ant tathaa anyaay kaa parimarjan hota he to ve chal karne se bhi nahin hichakate
 Killing Bali by hiding in Ramavatar and becoming the MLA of many tricks in the Mahabharata war in Krishnavatar is a reflection of his attitude
 chhidranveshi log inhen kathaon kaa upyog manamaani vyakhya karke ishwar-virodh ke rup main karte hai
 But it is necessary to look at them from the point of view of contextual knowledge, because in the Puranas or related texts, these passages are presented in the opposite situations only for the knowledge of specific duties beyond the ordinary
 dhyatavya he ki puraanon main tathvik gyaan ko hi brahm, paramatma or bhagwaan kaha gaya he
 The entire nature of Vishnu is cognitive
 puraanon main unke dwaara dhaaran kiye jane vaale aabhushanon tathaa ayudhon ko bhi pratikatmak mana gaya he :- In this way, Vishnu carries all the creative ingredients on his body
 vishnu kii akruti se sambandhit stutiparak ek shloke atiprasiddh he :- Shantakaram Bhujagasyanam Padmanabhan Suresham
 vishvadharan gagansadrushan megh varnan shubhangam
 
 lakshmikaantan kamalnayanan yogibhirdhyanagamyam
 Vande Vishnu Bhavabhayaharan Sarvalokakanatham
 
 Charity - whose shape is extremely calm, sleeping on the bed of Sheshnag, with a lotus in the navel, which is also the basis of God and the whole world of the gods, which pervades all the way to the sky, similar to Neelamegh , Extremely beautiful whose whole parts are attained by meditating by yogis, who are masters of entire worlds, who are destroyers of fear of birth and death, such Lakshmipati, a Lnetr God Srivishnu i salute
 vishnu kii sarvshereshthata kaa yah taatpary nahin he ki shiv yaa brahma aadi unase nune hai
 God does not have a high and low sense
 vah to lila main sristi-sanchaalan hetu sagun hone kii praathamikta maatr he
 Therefore, be it Vaishnava or Shaiva - all the best texts like Purana and Mahabharata declare with one voice that God is one
 kaha gaya he ki ek hi bhagavan janardan jagat kii sristi, sthiti or sanhaar ke liye 'brahma', 'vishnu' or 'shiv' -- in teen sangyaaon ko dhaaran karte hai
 There are many clear statements of Vishnu and Shiva being the same
 'avatar' kaa shabdic arth he bhagavan kaa apni swatantry-shakti ke dwaara bhautik jagat main moort rup se aavirbhaav hona, prakat hona
 The accomplishment of an avatar is considered in two conditions - one abandons one's form and eclipses the new form by action; And the second coming in a related form after taking a new birth, in which the condition of a situation in the womb of the mother is also included
 isamen atyalp samay ke liye rup badalakar yaa kisi duusare kaa rup dharankar punah apane rup main aa janaa shaamil nahin hota
 In the well-known seventh and eighth verses of the fourth chapter of Srimad Bhagavad Gita, God himself stated that the purpose of incarnation is that - whenever the loss of religion and the iniquity are uplifted, then for the sacrifice of gentlemen and the destruction of the wicked
 i originate in different eras
 iske atirikt bhagwat mahapurana main ek vishisht or adhik udaatt prayojan kii baat kahi gayi he ki bhagavan to prakruti sambandhi vruddhi-vinaash aadi se pare achintya, anant, nirgun hai
 So if they do not reveal their lila in the form of avatar, then how would the creatures understand their non-living qualities? Therefore, for the inspiring welfare of the creatures, he revealed himself and his leela
 isliye vibhinn avatar-kathaon main kai visham sthitiyaan hai jisase jeev yah samaj sake ki paristhiti ke anusaar uchit maarg kaisaa hota he! The first systematic list of incarnations of Vishnu is available in the Mahabharata
 mahabharat ke shaantiparv main avtaron kii kul sankhya 10 bataayi gayi he :- Swan: Kurmashta Matsyaash pradurbhava Dwijottam॥ varaho narsinghsch vamano ram ev c
 Ramo Dasharthischaiv Satvakat Kalkirev Chak arthath hans kurm matsay varah narsingh vaaman parashuram dasharathanandan ram yaduwanshi shrikrishna tathaa kalki -- ye sab mere avatar hai
 It has further been said that they are all past and future incarnations
 mulpath main varnan chah avtaron kaa he :-1
varah 2
narsingh 3
vaaman 4
parashuram 5
ram 6
krishna Since the Mahabharata is a work made before the birth of Buddha or before the imagery of Buddha being incarnate; So, naturally there is no sign of Buddha anywhere in it
 uske badale hans ko avatar rup main ginaney se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 The description of the avatar in the Dakshinatya text of Mahabharata is as follows: - matsay: kurmo varahashch narsinghsch vaaman:
 Ramo Ramscha Ramsha Krishna: Kalki Cha Te Dash
 yahan purvokt avtaron main se hans ko chhodkar tisare ram arthath balram ko jod dene se dash kii sankhya puri ho gayi he
 One thing can be proved from this account that till the time of Mahabharata, no more than ten avatars were imagined; Otherwise those Das avatars would not have been called 'all incarnations of the past and the future'
 baad main anya avtaron kii bhi kalpana prachlit hui or kul avtaron kii gananaa choubees tak pahunch gayin
 Despite counting 22 and 24 avatars in the Bhagavata Mahapuran, the majority of avatars have been the Mahabharata Das
 padmapurana, lingapurana, varahapurana, matsaypurana aadi anek puraanon main samaan rup se dash avtaron kii baat hi bataayi gayi he
 The description of Agnipuran is also exactly the same sequence
 is sandarbh kaa nimnaankit shloke praayah sarvanishtha he :- Matsya: Kurmo Varaashta Narasimhoth Vamana
 raamo ramashch krishnashch buddhah kalkishch te dash
 Thus, only the avatar of Vishnu is recognized

 The diffuse vein is the flow of vessels carrying blood from various body parts to the heart and becomes twisted

 Veins have to carry blood from the legs to the heart in contrast to gravity

 jis dhang se shikshak shikshaarthi ko gyaan pradaan karata he use shikshan vidhi kehete hai
 The term "teaching method" is used in a very wide sense
 ek ore to iske antargat anek pranaliyaan evam yojanaayen sammilit kii jaati hai, duusari ore shikshan kii bahut si prakriyaayein bhi sammilit kar lee jaati hai
 Sometimes people accept tips as a method; But it is a mistake to do so
 yuktiyaan kisi vidhi kaa ang ho sakati hai, sampurna vidhi nahin
 The same device can be used in many methods
 paathyavishay ko prastut karne ke do dhang ho sakate hai
 In one, students are given several examples to test or confirm a general principle
 duusare main pehle anek udhaaharan dekar chaatro se koi saamaanya niyam nikalvaaya jaataa he
 The first method is called deductive method and the second method is inductive method
 ye vidhi vyakaran shikshan ke liye sabase upyukt maani jaati he
 From the other point of view there can be two other types of teaching method
 pathyavastu ko upasthit karne kaa dhang yadi aisa hai ki pehle angon kaa gyaan dekar tab purna vastu kaa gyaan karaayaa jaataa he to use sanshleshnatmak vidhi kehete hai
 For example, in teaching Hindi, first the alphabet is taught and then words are taught
 tatpashchaat shabdon se vaakya banawaye jate hai
 But if the first sentence is taught and then the word and the letter are taught at the end, it will be called analytical method because it moves from the complete to the organs
 shikshan kaa ek prasiddh sutara hai - "moort se amoort kii ore"
 In fact, we have knowledge of the outer world through our senses, in which the eyes are prominent
 kisi vastu par drushti padate hi hamen uskaa saamaanya parichay mil jaataa he
 Therefore, tangible object is the simplest means of imparting knowledge
 isiliye aarambh se vastuvidhi kaa sahaara liya jaataa he arthath bacchon ko padhaane ke liye vastuon kaa pradarshan karke unke vishay main gyaan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Even the abstract is tried to be made tangible
 jaise, teen or do paanch ko samajhane ke liye pehle chaatro ke sammukh teen goliyaan rakhi jaati hai
 Then two tablets are mixed together and all are counted together, then three and two five become clear
 vastuvidhi kaa ek doosraa rup he - drushtaantvidhi
 The way in which knowledge is imparted by objects, in parables is the same as in parables
 drushtaant drishy bhi ho sakate hai or shravy bhi
 In this, the object is clarified with the help of pictures, maps, paintings, etc
 saath hi upama, udhaaharan, kahani, chutkule aadi ke dwaara bhi vishay kaa spashtikaran ho saktaa he
 When children gain knowledge from object and parables, when children get the practice of making some guesses and also understanding the indirect object, then the narration method is taken
 isamen varnan ke dwaara chaatro ko pathyavastu kaa gyaan diya jaataa he
 But in this method, students remain mostly passive listeners and reading is not effective
 isi se prasiddh shikshashasthri herbert spencer ne kaha he- "bacchon ko kam se kam batalaana chahie, unhen adhik se adhik swat: gyaan dwaara siikhnaa chahie"
 Lecture method is its companion
 ucch kakshaon main praaia: vyaakhyanvidhi kaa hi prayog laabhadaayak samajha jaataa he
 Herbert's five steps are often used in narration
 ve hai But only five steps are used only in learning lessons
 kaushal tathaa rasaswadan ke paathon main kuch simit sopanon kaa hi prayog hota he
 Although the question is a tactic, Socrates has given more importance to it by using the Q&A as a method
 isi se ise sukaraati vidhi kehete hai
 In this, questions are asked from the questioner itself, and based on his answers, the required answers are obtained by questioning him
 jab se bal manovigyaan ke vikaas ne yah siddh kar diya he ki shiksha kaa centre na to vishay he, na adhyaaapak, varan chaatr he, tab se shikshan main sakriyata ko adhik mahatv diya jane laga he
 Learning by doing, that is, acquiring knowledge through self-experience, is the most widespread teaching doctrine of the day
 at: ruson se lekar maantesri or dubi tak shikshashastriyon ne bacchon kii gyanendriyon ko adhik kaaryshil banane tathaa unke dwaara shiksha dene par adhik bal diya he
 Mahatma Gandhi also gave birth to basic education on the basis of this principle
 at: sakriy vidhi ke antargat anek vidhiyaan sammilit kii ja sakati hai jaise- shodhvidhi, yojana vidhi, dalton pranali, basic-shiksha-vidhi, ityadi
 The research was conducted by Professor Armstrong in Germany
 is vidhi main chaatro ko upyukt vaataavaran main rakhkar swayan kisi tathy ko dhudhane ke liye prerit kiya jaataa he
 This does not mean that the teacher does nothing and leaves the students to do arbitrary work
 sach puuchhie to vah chaatr kaa pathpradarshan karata tathaa use galat raste se hataakar sidhe raste par laata rahata he
 Its goal is that the knowledge that a student can acquire through his observation or experiment is not told
 is vidhi kaa prayog pehle to vigyaan kii shiksha main kiya gaya
 Then gradually it started being used in mathematics, geography and other subjects as well
 america ke prasiddh shikshashasthri duvi, kilpatric, steevenson aadi ke sammilit prayaas kaa fal yojana vidhi he
 According to this, natural environment is more suitable for enlightenment
 is vidhi se padhaane ke liye pehle koi samasya lee jaati he, jo praaia: chaatro ke dwaara uthaai jaati he or us samasya kaa hal karne ke liye unheen ke dwaara yojana banaai jaati he or yojana ko swaabhaavik vaataavaran main purna kiya jaataa he
 From this, its definition is made in such a way that planning is a problematic task that should be completed in a natural environment
 america ke dalton naamak sthaan main 1912 se 1915 ke bich kumari hellen parkharstr ne shiksha kii ek nai vidhi prayukt kii jise dalton yojana kehete hai
 This method was invented to overcome the defects of classroom education
 dalton yojana main kakshabhawan kaa sthaan prayogshaala le leti he
 There is a laboratory for each subject, in which books, pictures, maps and other material for the study of that subject have additional references
 vishay kaa visheshgy adhyaaapak prayogshaala main baithkar chaatro kii sahaayta karata he, unke kaaryon kii jaanch tathaa sanshodhan karata he
 The work of the year is divided into 9 or 10 parts, written as written assignments to each student
 chaatr us nirdhaarit kaary ko apni ruchi ke anusaar vibhinn prayogshaalaon main jaakar puraa karata he
 Work is divided among inventions
 jitani anviti kaa kaary puraa ho jaataa he utani kaa ullekh uske rekhapatr par kiya jaataa he
 The scheduled work of the second month is given only after the work of one month is completed
 is prakaar chaatr kii unnati uske kiye hue kaary par nirbhar rahati he
 In this scheme, students are allowed to work according to their interest and convenience
 mul sroton se adhyayan karne ke kaaran unamem swaavlamban bhi aa jaataa he
 There have been many variations of this scheme like schemes like Batavia, Vinetka etc
 decrauli yojana yadhyapi isse purv kii he, phir bhi uske siddhanton main dalton yojana ke aadhaar par parivartan kiye gaye
 Mahatma Gandhi's Wardha Scheme or Basic Education is also an education system of its kind
 gandhi ji ne desh kii tatkaaleen sthiti ko dekhte hue shiksha main 'haath ke kaam' ko pradhanta di
 He believed that the student would not know the importance of labor until he worked by hand
 saidhantik gyaan manushya ko ahamkaari evam niskriy bana detaa he
 Therefore, children should be taught from the very beginning through some form of manipulation
 hamaare desh main krishi evam katai-bunai buniyadi dhandhe hai jinamein desh kii teen chauthai janata lagi hui he
 Therefore, he considered both of them to be original handicrafts and gave them a prominent place in education
 basic shiksha kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai :- The last doctrine was strongly opposed and removed from basic education
 angreji shiksha ne desh ke adhikansh shikshit varg ko aisa pangu bana diya he ki ve haath se kaam karnaa hey maanate hai
 This is the reason that the affluent and upper class people showed indifference towards basic education, due to which this education has remained only for the poor
 at: yah dhire-dhire asafal hoti ja rahi he
 From the above discussion it is clear that the teaching methods are many
 sabakaa pravartan kisi na kisi vishesh paristhiti main kisi shikshashasthri ke dwaara hua he
 In fact, every teacher has his own education system and imparts knowledge to the students according to their interest and ability
 jo vidhi jiske liye adhik upyogi ho vahi uske liye sarvshereshth vidhi he
 Chak Kush village is a village in Almora district of Kumaon division under Uttarakhand state of India in Chaukhutia tehsil
 yun to bharat ke pracheen sahitya tathaa darshan ke sambandh main jaankaree ke anek saadhan uplabdh hai, parantu bharat ke pracheen itihaas kii jaankaree ke saadhan santoshprad nahin he
 Due to their inferiority, there is no systematic history of ancient Indian culture and governance
 phir bhi aise saadhan uplabdh hai jinke adhyayan evam surveykshan se hamen bharat kii pracheenta kii kahani kii jaankaree hoti he
 Without studying these tools, it is impossible to know the close relationship between India past and present
 pracheen bharat ke itihaas kii jaankaree ke sadhano ko do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- saahitiyik saadhan or puratathvik saadhan, jo deshi or videshi donon hai
 Literary means are of two types - religious literature and secular literature
 dharmik sahitya bhi do prakaar ke hai - brahman granth or abrahman granth
 There are two types of Brahmin texts - Shruti which includes Vedas, Brahmins, Upanishads etc
 and Smriti under which Ramayana, Mahabharata, Purana, Smriti etc
 comes
 loukik sahitya bhi chaar prakaar ke hai - aitihaasik sahitya, videshi vivaran, jeevani or kalpana pradhan tathaa galp sahitya
 Archaeological materials can be divided into three parts - inscriptions, currencies and ruined monuments
 adholikhit talika in strot sadhano ko adhik spasht karti he- The major means of information about ancient Indian history are literary texts which can be placed in two subsections - religious literature and cosmic literature
 inkaa pruthak-pruthak ullekh karnaa aavashyak he
 Brahmin or Religious Literature- Brahmin texts give immense help in imparting knowledge of ancient Indian history
 bharat kaa pracheenatam sahitya pradhantah dharm-sambandhi hi he
 There are many Brahmin texts by which the story of civilization and culture of ancient India is known
 ve nimnlikhit mukhya hai- The Vedas are the most ancient of such texts and they come first
 veda aaryon ke pracheenatam granth hai jo chaar hai-rugveda, samaveda, yajurveda or atharvaveda se aaryon ke prasar; parsparik yuddh; anaryon, daason, daason or dasyuon se unke nirantar sangharsh tathaa unke saamaajik, dharmik tathaa aarthik sanghathan kii vishisht maatra main jaankaree praapt hoti he
 Similarly, the Atharvaveda derives knowledge of the then culture and genres
 vaidic mantron tathaa samhitaon kii gadhy tikaaon ko brahman kaha jaataa he
 Aitareya, Shatapath, Panchavish, Taittariya etc
 are very important in the ancient Brahmin
 aitarey ke adhyayan se rajbhishek tathaa abhishikt nripatiyon ke naamon kaa gyaan praapt hota he
 One hundred chapters of Shatpath present historical stories in relation to Gandhar, Shalya and Kekya etc
 of northwestern India and oriental countries, Kuru, Panchal, Koshal and Videha
 raja parakshit kii katha brahmanon dwaara hi adhik spasht ho paayi he
 Among the Upanishads, 'brihadaranyak' and 'chandonya' are the most famous
 in granthon se bimbisar ke purv ke bharat kii avasthaa jaani ja sakati he
 Parikshit, his son Janamejaya and later kings are mentioned in these Upanishads
 inhen upanishdon se yah spasht hota he ki aaryon kaa darshan vishwa ke anya sabhy deshon ke darshan se sarvottam tathaa adhik aage tha
 The spiritual development of the Aryans is the oldest living religious state and the living example of meditation is found in these Upanishads
 ugantar main vaidic adhyayan ke liye chah vidhaon kii shakhaon kaa janm hua jinhen ‘vedang’ kehete hai
 Vedang literally means part of the Vedas, however due to this literature being sacred, it is counted separately from Shruti literature
 ve ye hai-shiksha, kalp, vyakaran, nirukt, chhandashastra tathaa jyotish
 Their separate class was established under Vedic branches and formulas were formed in the form of text books of these classes
 kalpasutron ko chaar bhaagon main vibhajit kiya gaya-shrout sutara jinka sambandh mahayagyon se tha, grihy sutara jo grih sanskaron par prakaash daalate the, dharm sutara jinka sambandh dharm tathaa dharmik niyamon se tha, shulve sutara jo yajna, havan-kuntha bedi, naam aadi se sambandhit the
 While on one hand one gets knowledge of the religious states of ancient India, on the other hand also its social status
 vaidic sahitya ke uttar main ramayana or saahitiyik saadhan sampadit karen The major means of information about ancient Indian history are literary texts which can be placed in two subsections - religious literature and cosmic literature
 inkaa pruthak-pruthak ullekh karnaa aavashyak he
 Brahmin or Religious Literature- Brahmin texts give immense help in imparting knowledge of ancient Indian history
 bharat kaa pracheenatam sahitya pradhantah dharm-sambandhi hi he
 There are many Brahmin texts by which the story of civilization and culture of ancient India is known
 ve nimnlikhit mukhya haimahabharat naamak do mahakavy sahitya kaa pranayan hua
 Both these epics hold their special place in the entire religious literature
 ramayana kii rachana maharishi balmiki ne kii jisamen ayodhya kii ramakatha he
 It describes the state border, the cities of the rivers and the powers, the government work Ramrajya etc
 mul mahabharat kaa pranayan vyas muni ne kiya
 The present form of Mahabharata is a repository of ancient history stories, sermons etc
 is granth se bharat kii pracheen saamaajik tathaa dharmik avasthaaon par prakaash padataa he
 The greatest feature of both these epics is that they direct the spread of Aryan culture to the south
 ramayana main tatkaaleen paur janapadon or mahabharat se ‘sudhama’ or ‘devsabha’ kaa hamen jo gyaan praapt hua he, usase pataa chalata he ki raja kis seemaa tak swechhachari tha or kahaan tak uske prabhaav or kaary kii simaayen in raajnneetik sansthaaon tathaa praja pratinidhitiv dwaara parimit thi
 The Puranas come after the epics, which number eighteen
 inaki rachana kaa shrey ‘soot’ lomaharshan athwa unke putr ugrashravas yaa ugrashrava ko diya jaataa he
 In the Puranas, the description of five types of subjects is in principle the following: canto, counterpart, lineage, manvant and hereditary
 sarg beej yaa aadi sristi kaa puraana he pratisarg pralay ke baad kii punarsristi ko kehete hai, vansh main devataaon yaa rishiyon ke vansh vrikshon kaa varnan he, manvantar main kalp ke mahayugon kaa varnan he jinamein se prayek main manushya kaa pita ek manu hota he or vanshanucharit puraanon ke ve ang hai jinamein rajwanshon kii talikayen di hui hai or raajnneetik avasthaaon, kathaon or ghatnaon ke varnan hai
 Despite being the subject of the above five Puranas, eighteen Puranas do not find the case of hereditary
 yah durbhaagya hi he kyonki puraanon main jo aitihaasik drushtikon se adhik mahatvapurn vishay he, vah vanshanucharit he
 Hereditary is found only in Bhavishya, Matsya, Vayu, Vishnu, Brahmanda and Bhagavata Puranas
 garud-puraana main bhi paurav, ikshvaku or barhday rajwanshon kii talika praapt hoti he
 But their date is fully uncertain
 puraanon kii bhavishyavaanee style main kaliyug ke nripatiyon kii talikaon ke saath shishunag, nand, maury, shunga, kanv, andhra tathaa guptavanshon kii vanshawaliyaan bhi praapt hoti hai
 Bibisara and Ajatashatru are mentioned in Shishunaga itself
 is prakaar puraana chauthi shatabdi kii sthitiyon kaa ullekh karte hai
 More mention is found in Vishnu Purana regarding Maurya dynasty
 thik isi prakaar matsay puraana main mandhra vansh kaa puraa ullekh miltaa he
 The Vayu Puranas throw light on the governance system of the Gupta emperors
 in puraanon main shudron or mlecchon kii vanshavali bhi di gayi he
 Mention of Aabhir, Shaka, Gaddabh, Yavan, Tushar, Hun etc
 are found in these lists
 brahman granthon main smritiyon kaa bhi aitihaasik mahatv he
 There are famous memories of Manu, Vishnu, Yajnavalkya Narada, Vrihaspati, Parashar etc
 which are accepted in the form of Dharma Shastra
 manusmriti main jisaki rachana sambhawatah duusari shatabdi main kii gayi he, dharmik tathaa saamaajik avasthaaon kaa pataa chalata he
 From the Narada and Vahspati memoirs, which were composed around the sixth century AD, it can be known about the proper relations and methods between the king and the subjects
 iske atirikt parashar, atri haris, ushnas, angiras, yama, umavrat, katyan, vyas, daksh, shartaty, gargey vagairah kii smritiyaan bhi pracheen bharat kii saamaajik or dharmik avasthaaon ke bare main batalaati hai
 Apart from the Brahmin texts of religious literature, the various stages of that time are revealed by the Brahmin texts
 baudhdhamtawalbiyon ne jis sahitya kaa srijan kiya, usamen bhartiya itihaas kii jaankaree ke liye prachur samagriyan nihit hai
 'tripitaka' is his great book
 sut, vinay tathaa amidhamm milakar ‘tripitak’ kehalaate hai
 The rules of conduct for Buddhist associations, monks and nuns are found in the Vidhan Vinaya Pitaka
 sutt pitak main buddhadev ke dharmopadesh hai
 Sutta Pitaka is divided into five bodies - pratham deergh nikaay main buddha ke jivan se sambhddha evam unke sampark main aaye vyaktiyon ke vishesh vivaran hai
 The second joint body sheds light on the political life of the sixth century before, but the social and economic situation is more than that
 tisare majhim nikaay ko bhagwaan buddha ko daivik shaktiyon se yukt ek vilakshan vyakti maanata he
 Fourth, a list of sixteen Mahajanapadas is found in the Angusadhika body
