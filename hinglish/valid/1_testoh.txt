 Lincoln had written all the things he wanted to teach his son
 sammanneey mahoday, main jaanata hoon ki is duniya main saare log achche or sachche nahin hai
 My son will also have to learn this
 par main chahta hoon ki aap use yah bataaen ki har bure aadmi ke paas bhi acha hriday hota he
 Every selfish leader has the ability to be a good leader
 main chahta hoon ki aap use sikhayen ki har dushman ke andar ek dost banane kii sambhaavna bhi hoti he
 It will take time to learn these things, i know
 par aap use sikhie ki mehnat se kamaaya gaya ek rupaya, sadak par milane vaale paanch rupye ke note se zyada keemtee hota he
 You will tell him not to bring jealousy from others
 saath hi yah bhi ki khulkar hanste hue bhi shaleenta baratna kitna jaruri he
 i hope you will be able to tell him that it is not a good thing to threaten and intimidate others
 yah kaam karne se use dur rahanaa chahie
 You will ask him to read books, but at the same time he will also remind the birds flying in the sky to see the butterflies hovering in the sun, flowers in the green fields
 main samajhataa hoon ki ye baaten uske liye zyada kaam kii hai
 i believe that he must also learn during school days that it is good to fail by copying and passing
 kisi baat par chaahe duusare use galat kahen, par apni sachhee baat par kaayam rahane kaa hunar usamen hona chahie
 Be gentle with kind people and be strict with bad people
 dusron kii sari baaten sunne ke baad usamen se kaam kii chizon kaa chunaav use inhen dinon main siikhnaa hoga
 Do not forget to tell him how sadness can be converted into happiness
 or use yah bhi bataaiega ki jab kabhi rone kaa man kare to rone main shame bilkul naa kare
 i think he should believe in himself and others
 tabhi to vah ek acha insaan ban paaegaa
 These things are big and long
 par aap inamen se jitna bhi use bataa paaen utana uske liye acha hoga
 Then my son is very young and very cute

 The district is the birthplace of Tamil social reformer Periyar and the famous mathematician Ramanujan

 There are two types of components that can be added to a circuit: hierarchy and parallelogram
 jis paripath main sabhi ghatak shreneekram main jude hon, use shrenee paripath or jis paripath main sabhi ghatak samanaantar kram main jude hon use samanaantar paripath kaha ja saktaa he
 In the series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in the parallel circuit, the same voltage is available on each component
 shrenee paripathon main prayek ghatak kaa karyrat rahanaa aavashyak he, anyathaa paripath tut jaayegaa
 The remaining components will continue to function even if any component in the sequence circuits is defective, but the entire circuit may be short-circuited if any component is short-circuited
 yadi kisi paripath main kisi sthaan par 10 om ke pratirodh kii aavashyaktaa he kintu vah uplabdh nahin he kintu 5-5 om ke do pratirodh sulabh hai to inako shreneekram main jodakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if two resistors of 20–20 ohm are available, adding them in parallel, the equivalent resistance of 10 ohm is obtained
 dedh-do volt sahan kar sakane vaale saikadon balbon ko shreneekram main jodakar 230 volt se gharelu bijli se unako jagamagaaya jaataa he
 If 24 volts are needed somewhere, 24 volts can be obtained by connecting two 12 volt batteries in series
 paripathon main bhinn prakaar ke avyav bhi shreneekram yaa samaantarkram main jude ho sakate hai udhaaharan ke liye diod kii raksha ke liye uske shreneekram main upyukt maan kaa fus laga diya jaataa he; yaa pankhe ko chaalu / band karne ke liye uske shreneekram main ek switch daalaa jaataa he
 In the same way, a diode is inserted in its parallel in order to avoid voltage in the reverse direction in an electrolytic capacitor
 kisi sthaan par 2 ampir dhara vahan kar sakane vaala diod lagaana ho to 1 ampear dhara vahan kar sakane vaale do diod samaantarkram main laga dene se bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 When two or more components of electricity are connected in such a way that the same current flows in them, it is called hierarchy
 arthath, shreneekram main jude sabhi avyavon main prayek kshan ek samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he
 However, the potential difference between the ends of those individual components depends on the electrical properties of those components
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi 10 om, 20 om or 50 om ke teen pratirodhon ko shreneekram main joda gaya ho or 10 om vaale pratirodh main 2 ampiore dhara bah rahi ho to 20 om evam 50 om vaale pratirodhon main bhi 2 ampear dhara pravaahit ho rahi hogi
 But the potential of these three resistors will vary

 The term CI is often seen as a synonym for competitive analysis, but competitive intelligence is much more than the analysis of competitors - compared to the organization's entire environment and stakeholders: customers, competitors, distributors, technologies, macro-economic data, etc
 Is about making the organization more competitive

 Although elements of organizational intelligence information collection have been a part of the business for many years, the history of competitive intelligence information was initially established in the 1970s
 Although the time of literature related to this area is at least several decades old
 1980 main maaikel porter ne campatitive-stritji: techniks for analising industries and compatitors naamak adhyayan ko prakashit kiya jise vyapak taur par aadhunik pratispardhaatmak kufia jaankaree kii neenv ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 It has since been most notably expanded by the pairing of Craig Fleischer and Babette Bensouson, who have incorporated 48 implemented competitive intelligence analysis into the practitioner's tool box, typically through several popular books on competitive analysis
 1985 main, leonard phuld ne pratispardhi kufia ko samarpit apni sabase zyada bikne vaali kitaab ko prakashit kiya

 Although the general approach would be to get competitive intelligence concepts ready immediately and taught in many professional schools around the world, there are still relatively few dedicated academic programs, core subjects or degrees in this field that are designed for teachers in this field
 There remains a concern, who would like to see more research in it
 These issues have been widely discussed by more than a dozen knowledgeable individuals in a special edition of Competitive Intelligence magazine dedicated to this subject
 duusari taraf abhyaasakarta peshewar manyikaran ko adhik mahatvapurn maanate hai
 Global developments in the field of competitive intelligence have also been quite uneven

 Most companies nowadays understand the importance of knowing what their competitors are doing and how the industry is changing and the information gathered helps organizations understand their strengths and weaknesses

 esai kii vaastavik samay seemaa antat udyog or is baat par nirbhar karti he ki isamen kitni teji se badlaav ho rahaa he
 Common questions that SI answers are like, 'where should we as a company be in x years?' And 'what strategic risks and opportunities are we going to face?' Such intelligence work includes identification of weak signals and application of methodology and process known as Strategic Early Warning, first introduced by Gilead and imitated by Steven Shaker and Victor Richardson, Alessandro Komai and Joaquin Tena and others

 As a result, despite seeing the Internet as an important source, most CI professionals gather intelligence from primary research using industry experts, networking with business events and conferences, from their own customers and suppliers, and so on
 You should spend your time and budget on doing it
 Where the Internet is used, primary research should collect information as well as sources based on which the company tells about itself and its online presence

 Also there is the fact that other factors can also be helpful in the construction of this currents
 a or ba ke bich vyavasthit kala antar kaa hona prathit hota he
 An analysis of the data of the ground currents and their corresponding geomagnetic fields has shown that the centers are clear, with variations in the variance curve of the northward-oriented magnetic component, and not by the rate of time of variation of the northward-oriented magnetic component
 As it should be in that case when it arises out of the induced induced effect

 adogva rampo Nicknamed 'taro Hirai' Edogawa Rampo was a famous Japanese writer and critic who has established an important role in developing Japanese mystic stories
 taaro hiri 1894 main mei praant ke naabaari naam sthal main janamen the, jahaan unke dada su vansh kii seva main ek samurai the
 When he was two years old, his family came to Nagoya from Kameyama in Mei Province
 unke kayi kahaniyon kaa nayak jasoos cogoro akechi jo aage aane vaale kahanio main "bal jasuson kaa club" naam kaa bal jasuson kii ek samooh kaa netaa tha
 Rampo was an admirer of Western mystical writers, notably Edgar Allan Poe
 unke upnaam po naam kaa ek rup he
 One of the other authors who had a significant influence on Rampo was Sir Ortar Conan Dial, whose efforts to translate his works into Japanese while he was an economics student at the University of Wasida
 or duusare the, japani rahasyamay kahaniyon ke lekhak ruiko kuroiwa
 Before the second world war 1916 main arthshaastra main oopaadhi praapt karne ke baad unhonen kai prakaar ke chote-mote naukari kii, jaise akhbaar kaa bhashashodhan karnaa, patrikaon ke liye haasyachitron kaa aarekhan karnaa, sadak main soba noodle bechnaa, or puraane kitabon ke dukaan main kaam karnaa
 He made his literary debut in 1923 with the publication of a mysterious story called "ni-sen Doka" in the nickname 'edogawa rampo'
 yah kahani kishor logon ke liye rachaaya gaya 'shin senon' naamak lokapriy patrika main prakat hua
 Her literary job began in 1923 by publishing the mystery story "do Sen copper coin" written by her pen name "edogawa Rampo"
 kahani 'shin sinen' namak lokapriy patrika, jo kishor darshakon ke liye likhi gai thi
 'shin Sinan' had previously published stories from Western authors including Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and GK Chesterton, but the magazine was the first to publish a large piece of mystery fiction by a Japanese author
 aise james bi haris, galati se isko aadhunik rahasy upanyaas kaa pehla tukdaa mana gaya tha
lekin rampo 1923 main saahitiyik drishy main pravesh se pehle hi, anya lekhakon jaise ruyiko kuriva, kido okamoto, junichiro tanizki, haruo sato or kaita muryma ke kahaniyon ke bheetar tahakiqat, rahasy, or aparaadh ke tatwon ko shaamil kiya tha
 Rampo's first story, "do Sen copper coin", was reported by critics to have focused on the logical process of 'reticination' used to solve a mystery within a story and was closely related to Japanese culture
 Is related
 is kahani ek vyapak shaamil "nembutsu", jo ek buddhist jaadu ke aadhaar par banaaya gaya swadeshi aksharo, or japani braille paddati kaa vivaran kiya gaya tha
 Over the course of the next several years, other stories were written focusing on Edogawa crimes and the processes involved in solving them
 in kahaniyon ko ab 20 veen sadi japani me lokapriy sahitya ke clasix mana jaataa he
 "the Case of Murder on De Hill" - About a woman who is killed in the course of a sadistic-extramarital extramarital affair, "predator in the Attic" is about a man hiding in the attic with his victims Puts poison in the mouth of the man, and in the "human chair", a man sits on top of his prey to make him feel the chair - all these are the euphemisms of other stories
 "darpan ke narak" jaise kahanio me rampo darpan,taal, or anya drushti- vishyak upkarnon dikhaai jaati hai
 Many of his first stories were primarily about investigations and the process used in solving crimes, but from 1930 on he introduced a combination of sensuality in his stories that summed up sexuality, bizarre, and 'atrocities'
 in samvednaaon kii upasthiti se log usko padane ke liye badi utsuk thi or lekhak kii kahaniyon ko bechney main madad kiy gaya tha
 Falling through these stories, people find a persistent tendency to include Japanese elements called "unusual sexuality"
 udhaaharan ke liye, upanyaas "lonly oil ke daanav kii sajeesh" kaa ek bada hissaa main ek samalangik doctor ek anya mukhya charitra ko pyaar kiya jaataa tha
 By the 1930s, Edogawa was writing regularly for a number of the major public magazines of popular literature, and he had emerged as the greatest voice of the Japanese mystery novel
 rampo kii kahaniyon me mukhayapatr jasusi nayak cogoro akechi, "di hill par hatya ke maamle kaa" namak kahani me pehali baar aayaa tha
 In many of his stories, Kogoro struggles with 'twenty faces' against his crime
 1930 upanyaas cogoro kii dili dost ke rup main kishor cobaiashi ko bhi apane kahaniyon me pesh kiya tha
 These works were wildly popular and are still read by many young Japanese readers
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan In 1939, two years after the Marco Polo bridge accident and the outbreak of the Second sino-japanese War in 1937, the government was ordered by the censor board to not publish the story "kamala" of Edogawa
 "kamala" ek anbhavi maanav ki quaderiplijic sthiti ke bare main vikrut kiya gaya tha jo sahayata se bina nahi rah saktaa tha
 The censor board apparently banned the story in the mind of being cut short by the current war effort
 is aay ke liye prakaashan se roylty par bharosa he jo rampo, ke liye ek jhatka ke rup main aayaa tha
 
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke dauraan, vishesh rup se 1941 main japan or america ke bich purna yuddh ke dauraan par, adogva apane sthaneey deshbhakti, pados sanghathan main sakriy tha, or vah yuva jasoos or adhikariyon ke bare main kahaniyon kaa ek number likhaa tha
 In February 1945, his family was evacuated from their home in Ikebukuro Tokyo to Fukushima in northern Japan
 vah kuposhan se peedit tha jab adogva june tak bane rahe
 Much of Ikebukuro broke out in Allied air strikes and the city was later destroyed in a fire
 lekin chamatkaarik dhang se, vah apane moti, mitti ghiri godaam studio bachaa gaya tha, or abhi bhi rikkyo vishvavidhyalay ke bagal main khadaa he
 Post war yuddh ke baad kii avadhi main, adogva apane itihaas kii samaj ke maamle main, nae rahasy katha ke utpaadan ko protsaahit karne ke liye or donon rahasy katha ko badhaava dene ke liye urja sauda samarpit kiya
 In 1946 started a magazine called 'jewels'
 He was created a "detective writer's club" in 1947 for Japanese mystery writers, renamed "japanese Mystery Writers" in 1963
 iske alaava, vah japani, europea ke itihaas, or america rahasy katha ke bare main ek bada lekh likhaa tha
 Many of these essays were published in book form
 niabandh ke alaava, unke yuddh ke baad kii saahitiyik utpaadan ke bahut bade paimaane par cogoro akechi or ladke jasoos club kii visheshta kishor pathakon ke liye upanyaas shaamil the
 Particularly during the late 1940s and 1950s, he researched the history of homosexuality in Japan with his dear friend Jun'ichi Iwata
 yuddh ke baad kii avadhi main, adogva kii kitabon main se ek badi sankhya main filmon main kiye gaye the
 Edogawa's interest in using literature as a departure point for making films has continued well after his death
