 Broadband over power lines, also called power line communications, have developed faster in Europe than in the US, due to a historical difference in the design philosophy of the power system
 Nearly all large power grids transmit power at high voltages to minimize transmission losses and then use step-down transformers to reduce voltages near the customer
 chunki BPL signal, transformar ke madhyam se tatkaal paarit nahin ho sakate hai, ripeter ko transformar se jodna aavashyak hoga
 In the US, it is common to have a transformer hanging from a small utility pole, its service data to a single household

 In order to deliver power to customers, this difference in design makes little difference, but this means that to provide BPL on the electrical grid of a specific city in the US, a greater number of repeaters would be required than in a European city

 Chach was the ruler of a Brahmin dynasty that ruled Sindh in the middle of the seventh century
 vah ek bhootpurv mantri or raja raay saahsee kaa pramukh salaahkaara tha
 After the death of the king, his widow became queen by marrying the queen
 usne apane samrajya ko sindh tak failaayaa
 The story of bold and successful attempts to unite the small 2 states, tribes and other independent factions of the Indus Valley into its empire is written in Chachnama
 chach ek brahman tha jo raay rajvansh ke sindh ke raja raay saheeras ke kaarykaal main prabhavi padon tak pahunchaa
 His father's name was Shilaise and brother's name Chander and before becoming king he had been the most influential chief minister of King Daring of Sindh
 kehete hai ki raja saahsee kii mrityu ke baad use vidhwaa rani se prem ho gaya or unase shaadi kar ke raja ban gaya
 He was opposed by Raja Daring's brother and contemporary King Rana Maharath of Chittaun and claimed his empire in Sindh
 haalanki baad main chach ne 660 isvi main unhen yuddh main parrast kar diya
 According to Chachanama, when Rana Maharath found that his army could not do much in front of Chach's army, he challenged Chach for a duel battle
 maharath apane kshatriya hone, yudhkala main nipun hone va chach ke ek saamaanya brahman mantri hone kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahate the
 He knew that Chach as a Brahmin would not be proficient in warfare and would be defeated by him
 chach is prastaav ke peeche kii manshaa ko samaj chukaa tha lekin vah is prastaav ko thukraa bhi nahin saktaa tha
 In doing so, he would be considered weak and his ability to govern would also be questioned
 usne rana ke prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya
 Chach knew that to win this duel war he would have to use all kinds of diplomatic and mental powers because he could not defeat Rana on the strength of physical ability and warfare
 isaliye usne ek chaalaaki bharaa daanv khelte hue rana kaa prastaav swikar kar liya or yah shart rakkhi kii ek brahman hone ne naate vah ghode par baithkar yuddh nahin kar saktaa he or vah paidal hi yuddh karegaa
 Rana immediately accepted this proposal as he felt that due to being experienced and more powerful, he would immediately defeat him in a face-to-face battle
 donon ghodon par se utar gayi lekin chach ne apane sahaayak sainik ko ghode ke saath apane peeche aane ko kaha
 As soon as he got close, Chach rode on the horse and attacked the Rana standing fast
 usne rana kaa sir apni talwaar se ek jatke main kaat diya or rana kii mrityu ke baad uski sena bhi haar gai
 Chach authorized his brother Chander to help in the rule of his empire
 usne apane paksh ke saradaaron ko acchhee jaagiren deen, virodhiyon ko kaid kiya or rajya ko susangathit kar digvijay ke liye prayaag kiya
 After defeating the king of Chittor, he defeated his opponents Iskandah and Sikka settled on the banks of river Beas on the north side

 He then extended his power to the area of buddhists south of the Indus River
 vahaan ke shaasha agam lohana ne uskaa ek saal tak saamana kiya
 But after Agam's death in the battle of Brahmanabad, his son Sirhand accepted Chach's subjection
 sarhand kaa vivaah chach kii bhatiji se hua or chach ne agam kii vidhwaa se vivaah kar liya
 He adopted a number of other diplomatic tips to get local residents and ethnic groups under his suzerainty and win their trust

 They had to wear black and red northerners, silk clothes were forbidden for them
 unhen ghode par bina jin ke chadhana or nange sir, nange pair ghoomana padataa tha
 This behavior of Chuch from the brave castes of Sindh proved ultimately fatal for India
 brahmanabad se usne turan va kandahar hote hue armanbela nagar kii simaaon par sthit saasanid par hamalaa kiya
 Chach ruled for forty years, but where he grew the kingdom, he also made him weak with some of his works
 uski mrityu ke baad uske bhai chander ne 8 varshon tak shashan kiya jiske baad chach ke jyeshtha putr raja daahir ne shashan sambhala
 According to Chachnama, Chach did misbehavior with Jats and Lohanas
 usne lohana ko talwaar na baandhane kii ajna di
 They had to wear black and red northerners, silk clothes were forbidden for them
 unhen ghode par bina jin ke chadhana or nange sir, nange pair ghoomana padataa tha
 They were ordered to keep dogs with them on exit and by cutting and supplying wood for the royal kitchen
 yah sab lohana ke liye behad asammanjanak baaten thi jisane unamem rajya ke prati asantosh bhar diya
 Chach was expected to revolt for power from Jato, so he enlisted in the army to keep them away from power, but did not give important posts related to advisors because he was afraid that these Jats would overturn the Kshatriya coup
 644 isvi main saasanid samrajya par islamic vijay ke baad rashidun kii sena ne makraan par akraman kar diya or rasil ke yuddh main sindh kii sena ko haraa kar makraan or baluchistan par kabja kar liya jo ki us vakt raay rajvansh ke adhinsth farsi kshetra the

 Buddhism is divided into four sects - Vaibhashika, Sautrantika, Yogachara and Madhyamika

 Hinayana is related to the Stableist Union and Mahayana is related to the Mahasanghika Sangh
 pehla sangh buddhavishyon ko parivartanarh tathaa doosraa sangh use aprirvnarh maanata he
 In bilingual justice, the separate existence of the two has been considered by considering two distinctions as "matter" and matter
 "vishayi" main rup, vednaa, sangya, sanskaar or vigyaan in paanch skandhon kaa; chakshu aadi chha: indriyon tathaa rup aadi inke chha: vishyon, in baarah aaytanon kaa tathaa indriya, vishay or vigyaan in teen dhaatuon kaa samavesh hota he
 The "subject" consists of representational religions for these four "sanskrit" forms of Rupadharma, Chittadharma, Chaitadharma and Rupacittaviprayuktharma
 is nyaay main jagat ko traidhatuk, sanskrit tathaa asanskrit dharmon kaa samshti rup, satya, pratyakshvedya tathaa kshanbhangur maanakar "arhat" pad kii prapti or du:khabhaav rup nirvana ko maanav jivan kaa charam lakshya mana gaya he
 For specific information about Vaibhashika justice, one should visit the texts of Buddhist scholars like Katyayaniputra, Vasubandhu, Sthyamati, Dinang, Yashomitra and Sangabhadra
 "sautrantik nyaay" main buddha ke sutratmak vachanon ke yathashrut arth ko vishesh mahatv diya jaataa he
 Its substance is the same as Kalpana Vaibhashika, the only difference being that both "knowable" and "knowledge" are considered direct in Vaibhashika justice, and knowledge in Saturnic justice is considered direct and knowable is imperceptible and enlightening
 sautantric nyaay kaa samuchit parichay praapt karne ke liye kumarlaat, shrilabh, dharmatraat, buddhadev or yashomitra aadi buddha panditon ke granthon kaa anushilan karnaa chahie
 In "yogacharya Nyaya", "vigyanism" has been accepted as a philosophical principle
 vigyaanavaad ke anusaar "vigyaan" hi ekmaatr satya vastu he
 The mind, mind and release are named after him
 vigyaan ke do bhed hai- pravritivigyaan or aalayavigyaan
 All behavior of the world is accomplished by tendency
 "aham" aakaar kaa gyaan aalayavigyaan he
 According to this justice, epigraphy is the soul
 donon hi vigyaan swaprakash evam kshanik he
 The world has no independent power

 His power is only practical

 According to this justice, the ultimate goal of human beings is to make the enlightened self-knowledge extremely clean

 "secondary justice" has adopted "nihilism" as a philosophical principle
 iske anusaar gyey or gyaan donon hi kalpit hai
 The ultimate element is the only "zero"
 "shunya" saar, asat, sadasat or sadasadvilakshan, in chaar kotiyon se alag he
 The world is the inversion of this "void"
 vivart kaa mul he sanvruti, jo avidya or vaasana ke naam se bhi abhihit hoti he
 According to this opinion, upon the retirement of the karmakales, a person attains nirvana and calms in the same way as oil and light when it ends
 madhyamik nyaay ke vistrut or vishad gyaan ke liye nagarjun, aryadev, buddhapalit, bhavvivek, chandrakirti, shantidev or shantirankshit aadi buddha vipaschiton ke granthon kaa parishilan apekshit he
 There are two proofs in Buddhist justice - direct and presumption
 pratyaksh ke do bhed hai -nirviklpak or saviklpak
 The "alternative" is the direct evidence of their being a subscriber to the subscriber
 "saviklpak jati" aadi kalpit padaarthon kaa graahak hone ke kaaran apramaan hi he
 The area of coverage in Buddhist justice is considered limited compared to Vedic justice
 uske anusaar tadutpatti or tatadatmya hi vyapti ke upjivy hai
 That is, only those substances which have mutual working sense or identity, they have wide-ranging sense
 buddha nyaay main nyaay ke do hi avyav maane gaye hai- udhaaharan or upanay
 It is from this elemental justice that the universality principle has been established by means of momentariness, scientific metaphysics, Pudgalanratmya and Dharmanatramya etc
 buddha nyaay main arthkriyaakaaritv ko ""satta"" kaa lakshan maanakar tathaa sthir padaarth main use asambhav kahkar bhavatmak padaarthon ko kshanik mana gaya he
 In Buddhist justice, it is considered necessary for one to be endowed with three titular forms in order to be saddhatu
 ve teen rup pakshasatv, sapakshasatv evam vipakshsatv hai
 Accepted in Gouthami justice, "non-discriminatory" and "unconstrained" have been called unnecessary
 buddha nyaay main vaisheshik kii bhanti teen hi hetvabhaansviruddh asiddh or vyabhichaari- maane gaye hai
 In Buddhist justice also, after the story, the differences between Jalpa and Vitanda are described, but in the end, the story is accepted as Jalp and Vitanda as hep
 kathanirupan ke sandarbh main chal, jati tathaa nigrahasthaan kaa pratipaadan or vivechan kiya gaya he
 In order to properly understand the view of Buddhist justice in respect of these subjects, measures like the heart, the proof, the Nyayavindu and the vadanayas are visible
 buddha nyaay ke sabhi sampradaayon main chaar aryasaty maane gaye hai - du:kha, du:khasmuday, du:khanirodh or du:khanirodh kaa maarg
 The meaning of sorrow in this is sorrow
 bhavachakr hi du:kha kaa kaaran he
 His second communal name is "pratyatmasutpad"
 iskaa arth he- "kisi chetan karta kii apeksha na kar kaaran ke swaabhaavik sannidhan se kaary kaa utpann hona
 " "bhavachakr" ke 12 ang hote hai
 Of these, the first two are related to the previous birth, the middle to the eight current births, and the last two expressions to the birth

 in yogangon ke seven se yatharth pragna kaa aavirbhaav hota he or usase bhavachakr kaa vinaash hokar moksh kii prapti hoti he
 Four emotions have been considered necessary to mount the Moksamarga
 ve hai- sab kuch du:khamay he, sab kshanik he, sab swalakshan he tathaa sab shunya he
 The practice of these emotions leads to the loss of worldly attachment and as a result, man becomes a path of the path of salvation and moves towards his ultimate goal Nirvana
 buddha, sangh or dharm ye teen ratna maane jate hai
 The shelter of these three is the root of all-round progress, especially spiritual upliftment of man
 buddha ke swaroop par chitt ko kendrit karne se manushya ke man main vitrushnata or sthirataa aati he, "sangh ke prabhaav se sadhak main vishwaas or utsaah kaa udai hota he, dharm ke seven se uske atmik bal kii vruddhi hoti he
 " buddha nyaay magadhi, pali or sanskrit in teen bhashaaon main pallavit or viksit hua he
 Therefore, study of these three languages is necessary for their vivid and detailed knowledge of evolution

 Like the earlier film The Bourne Supremacy, it has also faced criticism for its excessive use of the "shakey camera"; As Time magazine's Richard Corliss writes in his otherwise positive review, "why does it feel like the camera is suffering from Parkinson's when the dialogue scenes are seen? The frame of the film feels like a shiver and the speaker hides the listener's shoulder, This makes the audience quite irritable and divert their attention from the scene

 Steel is an alloy
 praayah mishra dhaatuon ke gun us mishradhatu ko banane vaale sanghatakon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai
 Steel is stronger than iron
 kaansa, pital, taanka aadi mishratu hai
 Alloy is a term that is widely used for any metallic substance, unless it is a chemical element
 mishradhatu banane kii kala ati pracheen he
 The truth is that the importance of bronze was so much in one era that the name of that era of development of human civilization has become 'bronze Age'
 yadhyapi shuddh dhaatuon ke kai upyogi gun hai, jaise ooshmaa or vidyut kii suchaalakata, tathaapi yantric or nirmaan sambandhi kaaryon main saadharantaya shuddh dhaatuen upyog main nahin laai jaatin, kyonki inamen aavashyak majbootee nahin hoti
 The most important method of making a metal stronger is metalworking
 is disha main 19veen shatabdi main bahut adhik prayaas hua, usee kaa fal he ki anek upyogi kaaryon ke liye aaj paanch hajaar se bhi adhik mishradhatuen uplabdh hai or nai mishradhatuen taiyaar karne ke liye nity nae nae prayog kiye ja rahe hai
 Today alloys with desired properties are made for any particular use
 dhaatuen jab kisi saamaanya vilyan, jaise amla, main ghulti he tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ko chhod detii hai or saadharantaya lavan banaati hai, kintu pighalaane par jab ve paraspar ghulti hai tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ke sahit rahati hai
 Such solid solutions of metals are called alloys
 anek mishradhaatuon main adhatuen bhi alp maatra main hoti hai, kintu sampurna kaa gun dhatvik rahata he
 Therefore, in 1939, the American Board of Examiners made the following definition of alloy - prarambh main mishradhatu kaa adhiktam upyog sikkon or aabhushanon ke banane main hota tha
 Copper, tin and zinc are 95 / 4 and 1 percent respectively in copper coins

 Platinum, gold and silver are used to add beauty to the colors of jewelery, to make them hard, strong and durable, or to mix them with other metals for sale at cheaper prices
 yah nishchay karnaa ki mishradhatuen saadhaaran mishran hai yaa rasinic yogic, ek jatil samasya he
 In some sense, these are chemical compounds, because when sodium succulents are made, then every piece of sodium in the cross causes a strong flame of light and the mercury becomes hot, a symptom of the compound being formed
 isi prakaar pighalate hue sone main jab aluminium dhaatu kaa ek tukdaa daalate hai, tab itani adhik ooshmaa utpann hoti he ki sampurna pighali hui dhaatu ujjwal prakashmay ho jaati he
 The color of many alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 udaahranarth, chaandi or jasta dona shwet rang ke hote hai, kintu inase jo mishradhatu banati he uskaa rang ati sundar gulabi hota he
 Gold is yellow and aluminum is white, but the color of their alloy is very shiny
 yah gun bhi yogicon kaa he
 On extracting the melting point of alloys, it is known that the behavior of alloys is of two types: The melting point of some alloys changes as the content of the metal changes, it is the property of the mixture and the melting point of some alloys is a constant temperature
 Occurs, indicating that alloys are compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke bhautik tathaa rasinic gun apni avyav dhaatuon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai or mishradhaatuon ke gun kisi bhi prakaar se avyav dhaatuon ke gunon ke madhya nahin hote
 This difference is due to the fact that when metals are melted together, they form many interconnected compounds and solid solutions
 mishradhatu kaa ghanatv apni avyav-dhaatuon ke madhya ghanatv se kam yaa adhik ho saktaa he
 The color of some alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 ye apni avyav dhaatuon se kathortar, kintu kam lacheelee tathaa ghaatvarghy or adhik bhangur hoti hai
 The melting point of alloys is always less than the melting point of the melting element at maximum temperature
 or praaia: nunatam taap par pighalanevaali avyav dhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 For example, an alloy containing lead, tin, bismuth and cadmium is faulted at 75 ° C, while the melting point of tin, the metallic ingredient at the lowest temperature, is 232 ̊c
 ye sab ve gun hai jinke kaaran mishradhatuen shuddh dhaatuon se adhik moolyawaan ho jaati hai tathaa udyog main adhik upyogi siddh hoti hai
 As a result of detailed study of the organization and crystalline composition of alloys by the fruits mentioned above and by microscopes, X-ray spectral measurements, thermal and chemical analysis and other physical tests, alloys are placed in three categories
 yah vibhaajan mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuon ke parmaanuon kaa samooh kis prakaar se sangathit he, uske aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 These three categories are the following: is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuen jab pighali hui hoti hai, tab ve ek duusare main ghuli hui rahati hai, kintu thos hone par dhaatuon ke crystal alag-alag ho jate hai, arthath dhaatuen paraspar aviley hai
 In this way, the alloy is a mixture of pure crystals of each element metal, and on cooling, one element separates the metal into solid form
 udaahranarth, ek taral mishradhatu, jisamen matraanusaar 10 bhaag sisa or 90 bhaag tin hote hai, jab thandi kii jaati he tab shuddh tin ke crystal pratham usee prakaar se pruthak hote hai jis prakaar shuddh him ke crystal chini ke tanu vilyan main se thanda karne par pruthak hote hai
 The temperature at which tin crystals begin to separate is lower than the melting point of pure tin
 tin ke galnaank ko jab usamen sisa ghulaa rahata he, gyaat kar sise kaa anubhaar usee niyam dwaara nikaalte hai jis niyam se pani main ghuli vaston kaa anubhaar nikaalte hai
 By this method, several molecules of those metals have been extracted, which remain as separate atoms in the diluent solution
 sisa-antimony mishradhatu mishran shrenee kii he
 Antimony is brittle and lead soft
 mudran dhaatu sisi, antimony or atyant kam maatra main tin kii mishradhatu he
 This alloy has the hardness of antimony, but it is not as brittle as that
 is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main ek avyav dhaatu ke parmaanu duusari avyav dhaatu ke crystalia dhaanche main bhalee-bhanti baith jate hai
 There are two different types of alloys of solid solution: tanba-nikal kii anek mishradhatuen jinka mahatvapurn upyog he, thos vilyan kii shrenee main aati hai
 For example, alloys from which nickel coins, rifle bullets and a wire have high electrical resistance are made
 canada ke bahut se khanijon main tanba or nikal ke sulphide hote hai, jinako galane se ek mishradhatu milti he
 It contains nickel and copper 67 and 28 percent and the remaining five percent contains iron and manganese respectively
 is mishradhatu ko monelle dhaatu kehete hai
 It is more tensile, flexible and corrosion resistant
 saadhaarant: dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar yogic nahin banaatin, kintu ooshmaa vishleshan dwaara gyaat hua he ki dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar bahut adhik sankhya main yogic banaati hai
 The class name of these compounds is interstitial compound
 is prakaar ke sabase adhik yogic kshar or kshareey mitti kii dhaatuen, aavart sarini ke visham upavirgo kii dhaatuon ke saath sanyog karke, banaati hai
 The amount of metals in these compounds is reflected by chemical formulas
 in sutron ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki is prakaar ke yogic sanyojaktaa ke un sab niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hai jo dhaatu tathaa adhatu ke sanyog se bananevaale yogicon dwaara pratipaadit hue hai
 For example, sodium, tin and lead are chemically reacted to form the following compounds: anek antaradhaatuk yogic bahut sthaayee hote hai or apane galnaank se adhik taap par garam karne se bhi apni avyav dhaatuon main vighatit nahin hote
 These compounds dissolve in liquid ammonia and thus the solution prepared is an electronegative
 jab inkaa vaidyut apghaton kiya jaataa he, tab ek avyav dhaatu, jo duusari kii apeksha nune dhanvidyuti hoti he, dhanagar par jamati he or duusari runagra par
 There is no theoretical explanation as to why interstitial compounds are formed
 keval itnaa hi pratipaadit ho paaya he ki ve dhaatuen, jinke gun ek se hai, ek duusare ke saath sanyog nahin karti hai
 Since these types of alloys are hard, brittle, very less tensile and flexible, only a few of these are useful
 sab mishradhaatuon ko saadharantaya louh tathaa aloh mishradhaatuon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 When iron is the base metal in the alloy, then that iron and when the base metal is any other metal, then it is called non-ferrous alloy
