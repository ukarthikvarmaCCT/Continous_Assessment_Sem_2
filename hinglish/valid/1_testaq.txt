 Quota system has been implemented in outsourcing service in Bihar
 ye faisalaa rajya cabinet ne buudhvaar ko ko liya
 The race to take credit on this matter started on Thursday
 vipaksh ke netaa tejasvi yadav ne daawa kiya ki ye asal main unka hi idia tha jise nitish kumaar lagu karne kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 In a press conference, Tejashwi said that if someone does not believe, then the Chief Minister can ask in front of Nitish Kumar
 tejasvi ne kaha ki isse purv jab bihar vikaas mishan main niyukti chal rahi thi tab bhi unhone saamaajik sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhkar niyukti karne kii salaah di thi jise mana bhi gaya
 Currently, Bihar Development Mission has an important role in the implementation of the seven decisions of Nitish Kumar
 rajya cabinet dwaara paarit prastaav ke anusaar ab bihar main kisi bhi company, jisaki seva rajya sarkaar dwaara lee ja rahi he, us company ko pachaas pratishat aarakshan dena hoga
 There will be 16 percent reservation for Scheduled Castes, 18 percent for Backward Classes, 12 percent for Backward Classes, three percent for Backward Class Women and one percent for Scheduled Castes
 nishchit rup se nitish kumaar sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye qadam par har dal credit lene main peeche nahin rahanaa chahta
 The RJD in particular assesses that Nitish has strengthened his roots in state politics by giving reservations to the people belonging to the most backward castes in the panchayats
 tippaniyan That is why Tejashwi Yadav has demanded from Nitish Kumar that if the Center does not make the data of caste reservation public then a separate budget should be made for the poor people by conducting a survey of themselves
 lekin ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki tejasvi ke in daavon par akhirkaar nitish kumaar kii kya pratikriya hoti he
 At the same time, JDU leaders say that Tejashwi's claim that he gave the idea to Nitish Kumar is laughable
 tejasvi ke daawey aajkal mungery laal ke hisan sapane kii tarah ho gaye hai kyonki vah kuch bhi soch lete hai or daawa karne lagate hai
 According to the resolution passed by the state cabinet, now any company in Bihar, whose service is being taken by the state government, will have to give fifty percent reservation to that company
 jisamen anusuchit jati ke logon ke liye 16 pratishat, ati pichhadaa varg ke liye 18 pratishat, pichhadaa varg ke liye 12 pratishat, pichhadaa varg kii mahila ke liye teen pratishat or anusuchit jan jati ke liye ek pratishat aarakshan hoga
 Certainly, every party does not want to lag behind in taking credit on the steps taken by the Nitish Kumar government
 khaaskar rajd kaa akalan he ki nitish ne panchayaton main ati pichhadi jati ke logon ko aarakshan dekar rajya kii raajnneeti main apni jad or majboot kii he
 The comments isliye tejasvi yadav ne nitish kumaar se maang he ki agar centre jatigat aarakshan kaa aankada saarvajanik nahin karata tab khud kaa surveykshan karakar garib logon ke liye alag bajet banaaya jaay
 But now it has to be seen that what is the reaction of Nitish Kumar on these claims of Tejashwi
 vahiin jediu netaaon kaa kahana he tejasvi kaa yah daawa ki nitish kumr ko unhone ne hi idia diya tha, haasyaaspad he
 Tejaswi's claims have become like the dreams of Mungeri Lal nowadays as he thinks anything and starts claiming
 nishchit rup se nitish kumaar sarkaar dwaara uthaae gaye qadam par har dal credit lene main peeche nahin rahanaa chahta

 With this, the BJP said that AAP is harassing people through this scheme

 Sisodia and Gehlot said in a press conference that the plan was followed and it was successful on the first day
 sisodiya ne kaha ki sam-visham yojana lagu hone ke pehle din somvaar ko niyam ke ulalanghanon ko lekar kul 192 chaalaan kaate gaye
 However, this figure is likely to increase
 parivahan mantri kailash gahalot ne kaha, 'main kareeb do ghante tak dilli kii sadakon par rahaa or main khush hum ki yojana kaa anupaalan kiya ja rahaa he
 Most of the vehicles were even

 Meanwhile, Delhi Pradesh BJP President and MP Manoj Tiwari said that Kejriwal government of the city is responsible for the increasing pollution in Delhi

 Describing the 'even-odd scheme' as the theme of the people of Delhi, he said, "it will be successful and possible only when the public transport system of the city is well maintained
" is prakaar to yah kami ko chhipaane kii koshish bhar he
 At the same time, Delhi Congress President Subhash Chopra also described the even-odd scheme as a 'drama' of the Kejriwal government

 unhone soshal media par kooda jalaane kii tasviren saajha kar logon ko gumraah kiya
 Apart from this, former Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken also criticized Goel's move

 There is a tense atmosphere in Tamil Nadu over the Cauvery water dispute, due to which all the matches of IPL from Chennai have been shifted to another venue
 bisisiai or chennai super kings ne tay kiya he ki uske baaki gharelu match ab chennai kii jagah pune main yojit honge
 IPL chairman Rajeev Shukla said, "the matches had to be removed from Chennai as the police said they could not provide security in view of the prevailing situation
" chennai superkings ko apana base pune main karne main koi gurej nahin he
 According to reports, two playoff matches are being held in Pune itself and due to this the stadium was given priority because preparations were already going on here for the matches
 pune main 23 may ko alimineter or 25 may ko kwalifire-2 yojit hona tha
 Explain that the protests of political parties are continuing in Tamil Nadu regarding the formation of Cauvery Management Board
 jiske baad chennai police ne ipel ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaane se inkaar kar diya
 Many groups have already called for not organizing matches in the city at a time when the state is facing such a serious situation
 kal siesake or kolkata nite rides ke bich match se pehle vyapak virodh pradarshan kiye gaye or ek gyaat pradarshnkaree ne siesake ke rabindra jadeja par match ke dauraan juuta phenkaa tha

 iske baad police harakat main ai or darshakon main se 2 logon ko giraftaar kiya
 Policemen and officials of Chennai Superkings approached the stadium and removed people from near the border
 aapako bataa den ki match se pehle bhi vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke pradarshnkaree sarvocch nyaayalay dwaara nirdeshit kaveri prabandhan board (siembi) or kaveri jal niamak samiti (seedbluarsi) kaa gathan nahin karne ke liye centre sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaaji kar rahe the
 Actor Rajinikanth has also expressed opposition
 Let me tell you that in the past, actor Rajinikanth has also said that it is shameful to play the match in Chennai, because the people of Tamil Nadu are burning with the Cauvery water dispute and the match is going to happen here
 vahiin abhinayta rajnikant ne yah bhi kaha tha, ki 'agar yahaan match hota bhi he, to chennai super kings ke khilaadiyon ko apane-apane haathon par kaale rang kii pattee baandhna hoga, jisase yah mudda or aage bade or kaveri jal vivaad khatm ho
 'what is the Kaveri water dispute, tell you that the river Kaveri, whose origin is in Kodagu district of Karnataka state, is about one and a half hundred kilometers long
 lekin abhi vivaad yah he ki kam barish ke kaaran yahaan is nadi main pani kii maatra kam he
 For this reason, Karnataka has refused to provide water to Tamil Nadu, due to which it has been in dispute for many years
 saath hi iske liye tamilnadu ne supreme court tak bhi gaye he
 Thus, the way the Cauvery dispute is going on in Tamil Nadu these days is very wrong for the people there

 Not only this, three roads in Mainpur area of raipur, the state capital, have also stalled due to Naxalites

 Of these, 37 roads have been approved for Dantewada for the last five years

 kankavr ke pakhanjur ilaake main ek thekedaar ne pichley maheene sadak nirmaan shuru kiya to naksaliyon ne uski darjan bhar mashiinon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 Significantly, this is the situation when Chief Minister Raman Singh released 170 crore in June last year
 kii laagat se nai sadaken banane or is kaam main lagi agenciyon ke karmchaariyon ko puri suraksha muhaiyaa karaane kii baat kahi thi
 But the Chief Secretary himself and Public Relations Commissioner N
 bajendra kumaar maanate hai ki naksali dehshat kii vajah se bastar main sadak bananaa mushkil ho gaya he
 Naxalites burn the vehicles of contractors in order to disturb the work
 thekedaaron ko daraaya-dhamkaaya jaataa he
 Due to the terror of the Maoists, the construction companies are withdrawing from working in Bastar
 bajendra kumaar ne kaha, ''bastar main kaam karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Nevertheless, efforts are being made to construct roads by providing security cover
 ''sadaken na banane dene kii naksalwadiyon kii ranneeti kaa asar vyapak he
 Dantewada, Bijapur and Narayanpur are the three districts where the government's law runs only to the district headquarters

 Similarly, 56 out of 79 posts of Medical Officer are vacant
 bastar jile main doctoron ke 149 pad sweekrut hai lekin mahaj 49 doctor hi yahaan kaam kar rahe hai
 There are 141 posts of doctors in Dantewada, while the posting is just 24 doctors

 The same situation is with the Education Department
 bastar jile main 77 chatravaas or skool bhawan banane hai
 Out of these, projects of 57 buildings are also approved
 narayanpur or bijapur jilon main bhi 100 se zyada skool or chatravaas bhawanon kaa nirmaan atka padaa he
 The department is not able to build schools at fixed places, so it has now been decided to build schools at such safe places as far as the road goes

 Sources also said that the Commission will resolve the issue on the basis of the dispute related to the split in the Congress Party in 1969
 congress main tab hue vibhaajan ke maamle ko chunaav ayog ab tak kaa sabase pramanit or adarsh cese maanata he
 The sp's decision on the basis of three points was decided by the Election Commission on the basis of three tests in the Congress case and according to sources, the Commission will now settle the Samajwadi Party dispute on this basis as well
 apane vistrut faisle main chunaav ayog ne tab congress ke donon samoohon ke daawey kii jaanch teen test ke aadhaar par kii thi
 First Test- The Election Commission based the Congress constitution to see which of the two groups did not follow the rules of the party constitution
 es nizlingappa ne party samvidhan ko aadhaar banaakar hi congress par apana daawa kiya tha
 Second Test: The Election Commission saw as a second test which group did not follow the aims and objectives of the Congress Constitution
 ayog ne paaya ki donon samoohon main se kisi ne party ke lakshya or uddeshy ko chunauti nahin di thi, yani is maamle main donon khare utre the
 Third Test - When the Election Commission could not decide on the basis of two tests, the Commission made the majority test the basis
 chunaav ayog ne party sanghathan or loksabhaa va vidhansabha main donon samoohon ke bahumat kaa pataa lagaaya
 The Election Commission observed that Jagjivan Ram's group had the majority of the people of the organization and the Lok sabha-vidhan Sabha
 raashtrapati ummidavaar ko lekar do khemon main bant gai thi congressbta den ki 1969 main raashtrapati pad ke liye ummidavaar ke chayan ko lekar bhartiya rashtriya congress do samoohon main bant gai thi
 One of these groups was the Congress 'J' supporting Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
 is group kii adhyakshata pehle si subrahmanyam or baad main jagjivan ram ne kiya
 At the same time, the second group was of Congress 'O', headed by S
 nizlingappa ke haath main tha
 Nijalingappa was also the President of the Indian National Congress before partition
 21 disambar, 1969 ko si subrahmanyam ne chunaav ayog ko patr likhakar bataaya tha ki congress varking cameti ne es nizlingappa ko adhyaksh pad se hataakar unhen party kii kaman saunp di he
 However, the commission was later informed that Jagjivan Ram has been made the chairman in place of Subrahmanyam
 to nizlingappa ne chunaav ayog main daawa kiya ki donon hi netaaon ko party se barkhaast kar diya gaya he
 The Election Commission, after examining the disputed claims of both the camps, considered Jagjivan Ram's Congress as the real Congress on January 11, 1971 and allotted the election symbol to it
 ye ab tak kaa sabase mahatvaparn maamla he
 The importance of that Congress split in 1969, the Congress split and its settlement by the Election Commission is considered to be the most important case study for such issues so far
 chunaav ayog ne is maamle par ek saal 20 dinon main apana faisla diya
 During this time, the commission spoke to several important people and recorded oral evidence
 doctor shankar dayaal sharma or morarji desai jaise bade logon se bhi ayog ne baat kii or congress ke maamle main faisla diya
 Both later held the post of President and Prime Minister respectively
 chunaav ayog ke faisle ke khilaaf jab nizlingappa samooh supreme court pahunchaa, to vahaan bhi chunaav ayog ke faisle or iske aadhaar par supreme court ne bhi muhar laga di
 The Supreme Court held that the test of majority and counting is valuable and appropriate in a democratic organization
 aise main congress ke is maamle ke baad se sanghathan or loksabhaa-vidhansabha main bahumat kaa aadhaar raajnneetik partiyon ke vivaadon ke niptaare ke liye pramanit, stareey or adarsh mana jaataa he
 If sources are to be believed, even in the case of division of Samajwadi Party and claim on election symbol, the Election Commission will base the ideal case of Congress

 1984 ke november main hue sikh virdohi dangon ke dauraan kanpur main bhi kai sikhon kii hatya hui
 33 years have passed since this riot, but still evidence of disturbances is coming out in the investigation of riots
 sirf kanpur kii hi baat karen to kai thana kshetron main darjanon sikh dangon ke shikaar hue, lekin ab tak exiaar darj nahin hui
 Some places were distributed even without FIR
 supreme court main bhi ye sunwaayee lambit he
 The court said in a hearing on Wednesday that on December 11, the central and UP governments should present a sealed report of the action taken so far
 yani muaavje kinako kitne die gaye or sajaa kinako kitni
 The All India Riot Victims Relief Committee has gathered evidence in this regard
 cameti ke adhyaksh kuldeep singh bhogal ke mutabik kanpur ke kakadev thana ilaake main 15 sikhon kii hatya hui thi
 This is confirmed by the government's response to the RTI petition, but the record of the police station does not record a single case of murder on the last day of October in 1984 and during November
 thane ke incharge kehete hai ki hamaare record main hatya kii dhara main koi mukadmaa darj nahin he
 anti-sikh cases are also registered in the sections of arson and rioting
 police kahati he ki exiaar hi nahin he, jabaki jile ke danga raahat ke nodel officer kii report kahati he ki haa un dangon main 15 sikh maare gaye the
 Now the government and the court have to decide where the mess is and who is doing it
 vahiin, duusare thane nazirabad main sikh virdohi dange kii ekenaiarato darj he
 a case of murder of a person has also been registered in it
 lekin yahaan mushkil he ki ghatana ke tisare maheene hi yani janvari 1985 main closer report bhi darj kar di gai or maamle ko rafa dfa kar diya gaya
 That is, where the charge sheet is filed in the 90-day period, then the investigating agency (UP Police) settled the case file
 yahaan kii hakeekat ye he ki ek hi parivaar ke 11 logon kii hatya hui
 No FIR was registered for the murder of these members of the Sidhu family
 bina exiaar ke chah mritkon ke parijanon ko paanch-paanch lakh rupye muaavja bhi mil chukaa he
 This is an interesting story of compensation of five lakh rupees
 ye muaavje unako pehle mili hai, jinako saadhe teen lakh rupye kii sahaayta raashi pehle mil chuki he
 That is, only one and a half lakh rupees were received later
 is maamle kii padtaal main jute akhil bhartiya danga peedit raahat cameti ke avatar singh hit ne kaha ki sikh bhaawanaaon ko ubhaar kar raajnneeti to bijepi ne bhi kii
 The Center and the state now have a TBP government
 naa koi esaiti bani or naa hi in gadabadiyon kii ab tak jaanch shuru hui
 Our trust has to arise
 akali netaa kuldeep singh bhogal kaa kahana he ki ye to ek shahar ke sirf do thanon kii hakeekat he
 There are many cities and neighborhoods where there was an orgy of death and fear
 sajaa ke naam par in 33 saalon main ab tak kuch nahin hua
 The government came for the Congress and also for the BJP
 hamaari party isi ummid main sarkaar ke saath rahi ki kuch hoga, lekin ab tak to sirf khokhale daavon or vaadon ke alaava kuch nahin hua
 According to the Uttar Pradesh government records, by 2016, 127 people were killed in the 1984 riots
 115 ko muaavja mila
 The rest are still wandering or disappointed
 unki exiaar yaa to darj nahin hui yaa record nasht kar diya gaya
 Severe stress in early life poses a risk of a behavioral problem
 ek adhyayan main yah khulaasa hua he
 According to the study, early life stress reduces brain size
 america ke visconsin-medicin vishvavidhyalay ke psychology ke professor seth paulak kehete hai, 'ham is baat ko vastav main nahin samajhe ki jab ham do, teen yaa chaar saal ke hote hai or hamaare saath koi ghatana ghatati he, to uskaa asar lambey samay tak kyon rahata he
 According to Paulk, early life stress is behind depression, anxiety, heart disease, cancer and educational and employment failure
 shodhakartaaon ne praarambhik jivan main shaareerik shoshan, upeksha yaa nichle saamaajik aarthik sthiti ke pariwaron se aane vaale 12 saal ke aasapaas kii umr ke 128 bacchon par adhyayan kiya
 He photographed the hippocampus and amygdala that control emotions and stress in children's brains
 in tasveeron ko saamaanya bacchon ke mastishk ke isi bhaag kii tasveeron se tulana kii gai
 Children who suffered from any of the above three stressors during early life were found to have small size of the amygdala
 saath hi aise bacchon ke hipocampus kaa aaytan bhi kam paaya gaya
 Jamie Hanson of Duke University said, "why early life stresses affect brain size is still unknown

 The Bombay High Court has relieved the management and fans of the ipl's Deccan Chargers team, stating that the bcci's decision to expel the Deccan Chargers' team from IPL-6 until the court-appointed arbitrator completes its proceedings
 However, the High Court has asked Deccan Management to deposit Rs 100 crore unconditional bank guarantee before October 9
 hoicourt ne apane faisle main yah bhi kaha he ki ipel-6 ke dauraan deccan team management ko hi team ke khilaadiyon ke saath-saath saport staff or franchizi fees bhi deni hogi
 The court said that even if the verdict of the court arbitrator goes in favor of the BCCI, there will be no action against the Deccan team for seven days after the verdict
 court ne spasht kaha ki deccan team ko hi ipel-5 se jude sabhi bhugtan bisisiai ko 31 oktober se pehle karne honge, jinamein hotel ke bilon ke saath-saath khilaadiyon ke safar kaa kharch bhi shaamil he
 The High Court also made it clear that if Deccan Management does not give a bank guarantee of Rs 100 crore before 9 October, then this decision will not apply
 darasal, deccan chargers ne bisisiai dwaara unhen ipel-6 se nikaale jane ke khilaaf adaalat kaa rukh kiya tha
 During the initial hearing, the BCCI informed the court that Deccan's financial condition is not good, and has allowed Yes Bank to run the team
 bisisiai kaa kahana tha ki agar deccan team ko chalaa nahin sakati thi, to use franchizi waapas kar deni chahie thi
 On this, Deccan in his defense told the court that he is committed to running the team and he has already collected the cost on the team's expenses ahead of time
 haalanki deccan ne adaalat main yah bhi kabool kiya ki philhal uski vittiya haalat thik nahin he, lekin kai bainkon ne unhen sahaayta dene kii baat kahi he
 The comments donon pakshon kii sunwaayee ke baad hoicourt ne kaha, deccan team ko ipel-6 se nikaalane kii puri prakriya main bisisiai ne sabhi faisle hadabadi main liye
 At any stage of the BCCI, no letter was sent to any of the banks of Deccan Management to give their views and provide financial assistance to them
 bisisiai ke aise faisle deccan team kii taraf galat ravaiye or ekatarfa faislon kii ore ishaara karte hai
 The High Court also said that it seemed to us that the BCCI took decisions against Deccan in a mess because they feared that if Deccan could not fulfill its financial promises, it would bring disrepute internationally

 film ne box-offis par kai record tode hai, lekin ek student ne is film par ek pregentation banaakar apane professor ko bevakoof bana diya he
 Actually, that student gave an 11-minute presentation on the country Wakanda mentioned in 'black Panther'
 haalanki asal main aisa koi desh hi nahin he, lekin tajjub kii baat yah he ki uski professor ne ise sahi maan liya
 Box office: The Hollywood filmstudent, who has earned twice as much as Iyari, shared her presentation on the micro-blogging site Reddit and told her professor- 'she only watches tennis on TV so she doesn't know anything about Black Panther
 unhen tab tak is film ke bare main nahin pataa tha, jab tak hamane unhen nahin bataaya
 'for the third time in 7 months, Hindi films lagged behind Hollywood films at the box office,' the student further said- 'I took Wakanda's name in front of him in a joke the day before the presentation
 uske baad unhone is bare main mujhase sawaal kiye
 Then i told him that i will give a presentation on this country and its power struggle
 wo aise desh ke bare main jaanane ke liye bahut utsuk thi, jiske bare main unhone nahin suna tha

 kai jagahon par murti plaster of paris kii he to kai jagahon par paryaavaran ko bachaane ke liye mitti kii lekin akola main vinayak ko kuch khaas tareeke se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 In Akola, Maharashtra, Veer Bhagat Singh Ganesh Mandal collected the entire Rs 11 lakh as donations and made a statue of Bappa from that
 lambodar ke is rup ko ek divyang kalakaar ne saakaar kiya he
 There are Tillu towers of Akola's Gavalipura campus connecting 1000-1000 notes with paper pins on canvas
 is pratimaa main 10 rupee se lekar hazaar rupee tak ke note lagaaye gayi hai
 It took Tillu 15 days to realize this form
 is anuthi murti ke liye pehle zila prashasan or police ne manzuri dene se manaa kar diya tha lekin jab mandal ke sadasyon ne apni murti kii suraksha kaa jimmaa khud lene par hami bhari to prashasan ne isaki ijazat de di
 This form of Lumbodar has been realized by a Divyang artist
 1000-1000 ke noton ko canvas par paper pin se jodne vaale akola ke gavalipura parisar ke rahane vaale tillu towri hai
 Notes ranging from 10 rupees to thousand rupees have been installed in this statue
 is rup ko saakaar karne main tillu ko 15 din lag gaye
 The district administration and the police had earlier refused to approve this unique statue, but the administration allowed it when the members of the mandal agreed to take over the safety of their idol
 athletics main kul 7 swarna, 10 rajat or 2 kaansya padak jitkar bharat ne asian khelon main ab tak kaa apana sarvshereshth pradarshan 2018 ke asian khelon main darj kiya

 In 2016, Neeraj became the first Indian to win a gold medal at the World Junior Athletics Championships in Poland
 vahaan jevalin thro main jeet hasil karne ke saath unhone us shrenee main nayaa vishwa record bhi kaayam kiya
 Then in July 2018, Hima won the women's 400-meter race in Finland to give India the first ever gold medal in the track event at the Under 20 World Championships
 asiad main bharat ne apane khate main aath gold medal or jod liye hote, lekin wo to do pashchim asian deshon ke outsource kiye africa athlete baaji maar le gaye, jinamein se kuch to duniya main sarvshereshth the
 Excluding these African athletes, we would have 15 gold, 4 silver and 1 bronze medals in our account
 africa athleton ke asian deshon kaa pratinidhitiv karne kii vaidhata ko lekar media main kaaphi khaasi charchaa he, lekin hamen to apana lakshya ooncha rakhana chahie—vishwa va olympic khelon ke manch par—or hamen muqabla karne main sakasham hona chahie, ve chaahe africa hon yaa koi or
 Our 400m female quartet and Jinson Johnson and Manjit Singh proved that they can beat the best players
 in athleton kii patibaddhta, dridhtaa, sankalp or athak prayaason ke alaava meraa jor is baat par bhi he ki is pradarshan ko hasil karne main team work, kushal dirghakaalin yojana or kargar kriyanvayan kaa bhi haath rahaa he, jisamen chayan samiti, prashikshakon, manageron, doctoron, physiotherapist or athletics federation of india (eex) ke staff kii badi bhoomika rahi
 We should also thank the Government and the Sports Authority of India, who helped in providing training facilities for athletes and preparation for participation in the competition
 athleton kii madad ke liye sarkaar kaa banaaya mishan olympic prakoshth nirantar vittiya sahaayta uplabdh karaate rahane ke liye har hafte baithta tha
 People are astonished by this performance, although anyone watching our athletes' progress may have anticipated it — only 12 athletes qualified for the London Olympics in 2012
 phir 2016 ke rio olympic ke liye 34 athleton ne kwalifai karne main kamyaabi pai
 This is the measure to measure this progress achieved by silence
 pehle asian khelon main 1951 main bharat ne athletics main das gold medal jite the
 Then in 1978 we had only seven medals in our account
 ab isko samajhane ke liye hamen yah yaad rakhana jaruri he ki pehle 1951 main or phir 1982 main bharat ke paas mejabaan desh hone kaa laabh tha
 Then in 1951, very few countries participated (only 11 while in 2018, 45 countries participated in the Jakarta Games)
 uske baad hamen 1980 ke dashak main china ke khel shakti ke rup main ubhaar ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga
 India had won only 4 silver medals and two bronze medals at the 1990 Beijing Games
 phir 1994 ke hiroshima khelon main china va japan ne milakar sabko post kar diya or hamen mahaj ek rajat or do kaansya padak mil paae
 Before that when the Indian athletes returned to the country after winning seven gold medals in 1978, China and Japan did not have that much dominance in the Games
 soviet sangh ke vighatan ke baad jab uzbekistan, kazakhstan, kirghigistan, turkmenistan or tajikistan jaise madhya asian desh asia kaa hissaa ho gaye to asian khelon main muqabla or tagada ho gaya
 Now the purchase of African athletes from some West Asian countries and adding them to their teams has made the competition even stronger
 jakarta main pradarshan se bhartiya gauravanvit hai
 Personally, it is a matter of pride for me that we got International Gold Medals in track and field and he would be my AFI President
 mujhe yakeen he ki timwork se ham olympic main behatar finnish kar sakenge
 But there is also a warning that the way to achieve this destination is very challenging

 hisar jile ke narnaund kasbe main ravivaar ko satarol khap ne kareeb 650 varshon se chali aa rahi parampara ko palatate hue shaadi ke bandhan ko khap kii simaaon va jaateey zanjeeron se mukt kar diya
 At the Mahapanchayat held at Devraj Dharamshala in Narnaund town, the khap chowdharis announced in unison that people of 42 villages of Satrol khap will now be able to have a relationship with their children
 iske saath hi jaateey zanjeeron ko todate hue faisla liya gaya ki koi bhi yuvak va yuvati apni jati se baahar bhi apni marji se shaadi kar sakate hai
 The only condition is that such inter-caste marriages should be left to one's own village, gotra and neighboring village
 iske baad khap panchayat ko koi aitraaj nahin hoga, balki antarjaateey vivaah kaa yah khap joardaar swaagat karegi
 Indra Singh, the head of Satrol Khap, who presided over the Mahapanchayat, said that the purpose of this decision is not to break the brotherhood of Satrol Khap but to open the bond of relationship
 mahapanchayat main vajeer maan rajthal ne kaha ki samay ko dekhte hue rishte-naate ke bandhan ko khol dena chahie
 This will not end the brotherhood of Satrol Khap, but will give Khap more strength after having a relationship
 basaauram narnaund ne kaha ki hamen rishte-naate karne main kaaphi pareshaani aa rahi he kyonki satarol khap kaa dayera kaaphi bada he or ise rishte-naate ke hisaab se chota kar dena chahie taaki vah apane bacchon ke rishte najadik ke daayre main kar saken
 He said that the number of girls has come down, due to which we have to wander far and wide for our children's relationship
 ab samay aa gaya he ki is vashro puraani parampara ko badal dena chahie
 He said that according to the time, Khap has made changes in its rules earlier and still it should be changed keeping in view the demand of time
 mahapanchayat main sabhi logon kii raishumaari kar paanch logon kii ek samiti banaai gai, jisamen ugaalan tapa se jile singh, narnaund tapa se hoshiyaar singh, baas tapa se hansraj or captain mahabir singh va satarol khap ke pradhan subedaar indra singh ko shaamil kar nirnay liya gaya
 This committee decided that from today the people of Satrol Khap will be able to have kinship
 lekin mahapanchayat ke is aitihaasik faisle kaa virodh bhi hua
 In protest against breaking the 650-year-old tradition, the people of Petawad Tapa put forth their views and said that khap only means mutual brotherhood
 isamen rishtedaari nahin ho sakati he
 When there is a relationship between themselves, then where is the brotherhood left? iskaa kadaa virodh karte hue tapa kii aguwai kar rahe logon ne mahapanchayat kaa bahishkaar karne kaa nirnay kiya or mahapanchayat se uthakar chale gaye
