 In relation to the subject matter of economics, a description of economic activities is also necessary
 purv main utpaadan, upbhog, vinimay tathaa vitaran - arthshaastra ke ye chaar pradhan ang maane jate the
 In modern economics, these verbs can be divided into five parts
 aarthik kriyaaon ke uddeshy ke aadhaar par 1933 main sarvapratham reganar frrish ne arthshaastra ko do bhaagon main baanta
 International trade, foreign regulations, banking, etc
 are forms of macroeconomics

 In Bolding's words, macroeconomics is that part of economics that studies the large groups and averages of economics, not its special items
 vah in samoohon ko upyogi dhang se paribhaashit karne kaa praytn karata he tathaa inke parsparik sambandhon ko jaanchata he
 In short, it is part of economics

 We derive the economic ideas of ancient times from the Vedas, Upanishads, epics, theology, the Grihasutras, the scriptures of Narada, Venus, Vidur and most importantly the Arthashastra of Kautilya
 aadhunik bharat main mukhya bhartiya arthshaastriyon main- This ideology of economics practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and used by Acharya Vinoba Bhave is very modern and is a unique gift of Indians

 aarthik siddhanton ko spasht karne hetu ganitiya aujaaron kaa prayog sab arthshaastri kar rahe hai
 Under Linear Programming and 'differentiation Process', economists are trying to show mathematical visual effects as well as invisible economic effects
 gananaa kii choti mashin se lekar vishaltam computer tak arthshaastriyon kii ganitiya pragati ke vyaavhaarik rup hai
 Probably, for the next two to three decades, such methods will be degraded by which only the conclusions will be obtained by mathematical methods very briefly and it will not be necessary to make any synergy of the process
 aajkal arthshaastri ganitiya arthshaastra paddati par sabase adhik nirbhar kar rahe hai
 Practical economics is solving practical problems of poor and resourceless countries
 gunar mridle krit asian drama sambhavat: marks ke das capital ke baad sabase bada arthshaastreey granth prakashit hua he jisamen alpaviksit deshon kii samasyaayen sulajhaai gai hai

 It is a matter of satisfaction that economists are now beginning to understand this

 Prof
 Shumpeter has accepted in his latest article Economics in the future that no matter how much progress the economic analysis can make in principle, in practice it will always have to work for peace, happiness and welfare

 Police &capf The pulley is a circular column, from which the power of the machine is carried from one place to another
 yadi kisi kharad ko ingine se chalaanaa he, to ingine kii ghirani or kharad kii ghirani par patta chadhaakar ingine kii shakti se kharad ko chalaate hai
 The speed of the machines can be reduced or increased by the diameter of the pulley
 mashiinon kii shakti ko bina kisi haani ke to daantonvale chakron se hi ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par le jaaya ja saktaa he, parantu jahaan in sthanon main duuri adhik ho vahaan in chakron kaa upyog nahin ho saktaa
 In these places the pulleys are used
 inpar chamade ke patton yaa rasson ko chadhaakar ek ghirani se duusari ghirani ko shakti di jaati he
 The pulley only changes the direction of the force, not the magnitude of the force
 
 If another machine is being run from the engine, the engine puller will be called the pulley and the pulley of the pulley of the machine
 ghiraniyaan praaia: dhalwaan lohe kii hoti hai, jinamein bich kaa bhaag ghirani ke haal se baajuon dwaara judaa hota he
 They range from four to six in number
 ghirani ke bichwaale bhaag ke chhed main dhuree ko daalkar kas diya jaataa he
 The measurement of each part of the pulley is such that it can bear every force that falls on it
 ghirani ke haal kii chaudaai patte kii chaudaai se kuch hi zyada rakhi jaati he
 There will be two types of force on it, one due to the stretch of the strap and the other due to its rotation
 yah dekha gaya he ki ek varg inch pariched ke haal kii ghirani kii gati 100 foot prati second se adhik honi chahie
 Therefore the cast iron ring is not run faster than this speed
 jahaan adhik gati kii aavashyaktaa hoti he vahaan kachche or dhalwaan lohe ko milakar ghirani banaai jaati he
 It should be noted that the high-speed pulleys are not molded, but different parts of it are separated and connected by screws
 is prakaar kii ghirani kaa bhaar bhi praaia: adhik nahin hota or na uske tuutane kaa itnaa dar rahata he
 It is also taken care in making a pulley that its center of attraction is right in the middle
 yadi aisa na hua to dhuree ke ghoomte hi usamen thartharaahat paidaa hogi or dhuree ko tolan kharaab ho jaayga
 Therefore, the weight of the pulley is mounted on its axis and its weight is checked
 isko jaanchne ke liye dhuree ko donon kinaaron se aadhaaron par rakh diya jaataa he
 If the axle stops at every place and does not rotate, its weight will be fine and if it rotates to another side, it will show that the pulley is heavier from one side
 ghirani jis ore baari hoti he uske duusari ore utana hi vajan baandhakar iskaa tolan thik kar liya jaataa he
 Details of different types of pulleys are given below: yah ghirani alag alag vyas kii do yaa usase zyada ghiraniyon ko milakar banaai jaati he
 The padhni is molded into a single part
 inkaa upyog usee sthaan par hota he jahaan chalaane or chalanevaali donon ghiraniyaan hon or chalanevaali mashin kii gati ko badalane kii bhi aavashyaktaa ho
 These pulleys are arranged in such a way that the small pulley of one pulley is in front of the big pulley of the other
 isse patte ko ek pad se duusare pad par badalane se patte kii lambaai main koi antar nahin aata, isaliye patte ko ghirani par chadhaane se pehle uski lambaai donon ghiraniyon ke vyaason kaa lekar nikaal lee jaati he
 The strap which is mounted on the pulley also changes the direction of the moving machine
 isse liye yadi patte ke donon baaju samaantar hai, to chalanevaali ghirani ke ghoomane kii disha vahi hogi jo chalaanevaali ghirani kii he
 If this direction is to be changed, then the leash arms are mounted on each other to the pulley
 yah ghirani praaia: chote aakaar kii hoti he or patte kaa tanaav thik banaae rakhane ke kaam aati he
 a spindle on its axis is left on the leash and due to the force of the skand, it holds the pulley strap
 chalate chalate yadi patte kaa tanaav kam ho jaae, to skanda ke dabaav ke kaaran savaar ghirani patte par or dab jaati he, jisase tanaav main kami nahin ho paati
 That is why the riding pulley is installed on almost every lease
 ye donon ghiraniyaan paas paas chalaanevaali dhuriyaan par lagaai jaati hai or in donon kaa vyas baraabar hota he
 The first pulley is tightened on the spindle and is used to run the machines
 duusari dhili ghirani na to dhuree ke ghoomane se gumti he or na iske ghoomane se dhuree gumti he
 Applying a loose pulley only means that the axle rotates when the strap is brought from the pulley pulley, but the gripper stops
 isaliye jo mashin is dhuree se chalaai ja rahi ho, vah bina dhuree ke roke hue roki ja sakati he
 When this machine has to be run again, the leash is brought on a static pulley
 in ghiraniyon kaa aakaar v kii shakl kaa hota he or ye vahaan kaam aati hai jahaan rasson ko shakti le jane ke kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 In some places the power is so much that it cannot be carried with leather straps
 isaliye kai kai rasson ko milakar is prakaar kii ghiraniyon par chadha diya jaataa he
 These ropes are also made of yarn and also of iron wire
 doosraa laabh in rasson se yah hota he ki chalate samay ye ghiraniyon par utana nahin phisalte jitna chamade kaa patta phisalata he
 It does not cause loss of power
 yadi chalane or chalaanevaali dhuriyaan samaantar nahin he, to patta ghiraniyon par se phisal jayega
 To prevent this, the road pulley is used
 is ghirani ko is prakaar lagaaya jaataa he ki chalaanevaali ghirani or maarg ghirani kii dhuriyaan ek samtal main hon or maarg ghirani tathaa chalanevaali ghirani kii dhuree ek samtal main ho
 This will not remove the leash mounted on the pulleys

 At the time when there were new ideas about the religion of Lord Mahavira and Buddha in India, a reformer was born in China, named Confucius
 us samay china main jhou rajvansh kaa basant or sharad kaal chal rahaa tha
 Over time, the power of the Zhou dynasty had become weak, many states were established in China, which always fought among themselves, which came to be called the era of quarreling states
 atah china kii praja bahut hi ksht jhel rahi thi
 At such a time, Mahatma Confucius emerged to teach morality lessons to the people of China
 inkaa janm isa messiah ke janm se kareeb 550 varsh pehle china ke shandong pradesh main hua tha
 His father died in childhood
 unke gyaan kii aakanksha aseem thi
 They had to acquire knowledge by suffering a lot
 17 varsh kii umr main unhen ek sarkari naukari mili
 After a few years, he left the government job and started teaching
 ghar main hi ek vidhyalay kholkar unhone vidhyaarthiyon ko shiksha dena prarambh kiya
 He used to teach students history, poetry and ethics orally
 unhone kavy, itihaas, sangeet or nitishastra par kai pustakon kii rachana kii
 He was the ruler of a city in Lu State at the age of 53 and later he was appointed as a minister
 mantri hone ke naate inhone dand ke badale manushya ke charitra sudhaar par bal diya
 Confucius gave the message of truth, love and justice to his disciples
 ve sadachaar par adhik bal dete the
 He used to inspire people to become humble, benevolent, virtuous and characterful
 They used to ask elders and ancestors to respect them
 He used to say don't treat others like you don't want to do with yourself
 kanceyucious ek sudhaarak the, dharm prachaarak nahin
 He did not give any teachings about God, but still later people started considering him as a religious teacher
 inaki mrityu 480 i

 Confucian social reformers preached a stability in Chinese society
 kanceyucious kaa darshan shaastra aaj bhi chini shiksha ke liye path pradarshak bana hua he
 The Confucians never thought it necessary to give their ideas in writing
 uskaa mat tha ki vah vichaaron kaa vaahak ho saktaa he, unka srashta nahin
 He was a worshiper of archeology, because he thought that only through this can real knowledge be gained
 uskaa kahana tha ki manushya ko uske samast kaaryakalapon ke liye niyam apane andar hi praapt ho sakate hai
 Not only for the individual, but the rules and patterns of improvement and correct development of the whole society can be found in the words and work of the ancient Mahatmas
 kanfushas ne koi aisa lekh nahin choda jisamen uske dwaara pratipaadit naitik evam saamaajik vyavastha ke siddhanton kaa nirupan ho
 But all the information related to it is found in books called 'the Principle of Average' written by his grandson Tje Sje and 'mahan Shiksha' written by his disciple Tsong Sin
 'basant or patjhad' naamak ek granth, jise lu kaa itivrutt bhi kehete hai, kanfushas kaa likhaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 This entire work is well received and although very small, it is considered ideal for brief histories of China
 kanfushas ke shishyon kii sankhya sab milakar praaia: 3,000 tak pahunch gai thi, kintu unamem se 75 ke lagbhag hi ucch koti ke pratibhashali vidvan the
 His dear disciples used to stay near him
 ve uske aasapaas shraddhapurvak uthte-baithte the or uske aacharan kii sookshm visheshtaon par dhyaan diya karte the tathaa uske mukh se nikali vaani ke prayek shabd ko hridyangam kar lete or usapar manan karte the
 He used to study ancient history, poetry and social practices of the country from him
 kanfushas kaa kahana tha ki kisi desh main acha shashan or shanti tabhi sthapit ho sakati he jab shaasha, mantri tathaa janata kaa prayek vyakti apane sthaan par uchit kartavyon kaa paalan karata rahe
 The ruler should be the ruler in the true sense, the minister should be the minister in the true sense
 kanfushas se ek baar poocha gaya ki yadi use kisi pradesh ke shashansutra ke sanchaalan kaa bhaar saunpa jaae to vah sabase pehla koun sa mahatvapurn kaary karegaa
 His answer for this was - 'improvement of Names'
 iskaa aashay yah tha ki jo jis naam ke pad par pratishthit ho use us pad se sanlagn sabhi kartavyon kaa vidhiwat paalan karnaa chahie jisase uskaa vah naam sarthak ho
 He had full faith in the power of example and ideal
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki adarsh vyakti apane sadacharan se jo udhaaharan prastut karte hai, aam janata unke saamne nishchay hi jhuk jaati he
 If the ruler of a country is made well aware of what he should do and how to do governance, then surely he can improve his conduct and make his state happy by presenting his example, Can make it rich and prosperous
 isi vishwaas ke bal par kanfushas ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadi koi shaasha 12 maheene ke liye use apana mukhya paramarshdaata bana le to vah bahut kuch karke dikhaa saktaa he or yadi use teen varsh kaa samay diya jaae to vah apane aadarsho or aashaaon ko moort rup pradaan kar saktaa he
 Confucius never claimed that he received any divine power or divine messages
 vah keval is baat kaa chintan karata tha ki vyakti kya he or samaaj main uske kartavya kya hai
 He never mentioned power performance, extraordinary and non-human powers, rebellious tendencies and deities
 uskaa kathan tha ki budhimatta kii baat yahi he ki prayek vyakti purna uttardayitv or eemaandaaree se apane kartavya kaa paalan kare or devi devataaon kaa aadar karte hue bhi unase alag rahe
 He was of the opinion that the person who cannot serve human beings will serve the Gods and Goddesses
 use apane or dusron ke sabhi kartavyon kaa purna dhyaan tha, isiilie usne kaha tha ki bura aadmi kabhi bhi shashan karne ke yogya nahin ho saktaa, bhale hi vah kitna bhi shaktisampann ho
 The ruler punishes those who violate the rules, but he should never forget that there is no power other than the power to present his ideal of good conduct
 kanfushas ke darshanik, saamaajik tathaa raajnneetik vichaaron par aadhaarit mat ko kanfooshivaad yaa kungaphutsiwad naam diya jaataa he
 According to Confucian, goodness is a natural quality of man
 manushya ko yah swaabhaavik gun ishwar se praapt hua he
 Therefore, to act according to this nature is to respect God's will and to not act accordingly is to disobey God

 Font or type faces are different styles of letter writing that give variety and beauty to the print text
 hindi font do prakaar ke hote hai:- Fonts that are in accordance with the Unicode standard and display text using the script engine of the computer's operating system are called Unicode fonts
 vartmaan main computer evam internet par tamaam kaaryon main inhen kaa prayog hota he
 Using Unicode fonts, Hindi and other Indian languages can be written everywhere on the computer in the same way as English can be written

 Some popular Unicode Hindi fonts are: - windos 7 ke hindi font:- These are fonts that are built to the old 8 bit standards

 Currently, they have been replaced by Unicode fonts on the computer's normal functions and on the Internet
 vartmaan main ye keval ditipi evam graphics hetu prayog main laaye jate hai kyonki kai ditipi evam graphics software indic unicode kaa samarthan nahi karte
 Apart from this, the lack of beautiful Unicode fonts for printing is also a reason due to which non-unicode fonts are still used
 kuch prachlit non-unicode hindi font hai:- Most non-unicode fonts are based on Remington layouts
 remington main tip karne hetu aam taur par kisi anya aujaar kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 a tool called e-pandit Aymai is available for typing in these fonts through the standard keyboard layout inscript of Hindi

 Although this font is not as beautiful as Sanskrit 2003 but it has the most symbols

 The work was based on the prose love-story Rosalind of Thomas Lodge
 haalanki is naatak ke pehle pradarshan kii jaankaree anishchit he, parantu sujhaavon ke anusaar, 1603 main wilton house main iske ek pradarshan kii sambhaavna jataai gai he
 The story of As You Like It revolves around the heroine Rosalind, who, along with her cousin Celia and the castle's clown touchstones, runs away from her uncle's castle to find safety and eventual love in the forest of Arden, fearing persecution
 is

 Frederick fraudulently seized the territory of his elder brother, Duke Sr
, and exiled him
 duk kii beti roslind ko mahal main rahane kii anumati di gai kyonki vah fredrick kii akeli santaan celia kii kareebi dost or chacheri bahan bhi he
 Orlando, a young man from the state who falls in love with Rosslind at first sight, is forced to flee his home after being persecuted by his elder brother, Oliver
 fredrick krodhit ho jaataa he or roslind ko sabha se baahar nikaal detaa he
 Celia and Rosalind decide to elope with Jester Touchstone, during which Rosalind disguises a young man
 roslind, jo ab genimad ke chhadam rup main he or celia jo eliena ke chhadam vesh main he, arkedian arden ke jangal main pahunchate hai, jahaan nirvasit, duk apane kuch samarthakon ke saath rahete hai, in samarthakon main "udhaas jacks" bhi shaamil he jiskaa parichay hamen tab miltaa he jab vah ek hiran ke vadh par rota he
 "ganymede" and "aliena" do not immediately meet Duke and his comrades, as they first meet a poor tenant named Corinne and offer to buy her owner's rough house
 orlando or uskaa naukar adams, is bich, duk or uske saathiyon se milte hai or unke saath hi rahane lagate hai or roslind ke liye ekatarfa pranaygit pedo par chhodane lagate hai
 Rosalind is also in love with Orlando and she meets him as Ganymede and pretends to consult him to save him from the disease
 genimad kahata he ki "vah" roslind kii jagah "legaa" or "vah" or orlando apane sambandh ko naatakeey rup se nibhaayenge
 Meanwhile, Gatherin Phebe, whom Silvius loves, falls in love with Ganymede, while "ganymede" actually reveals that he is not interested in Phebe
 nandak tochastone bhi ek mudh-buddhi bakrii-charaane vaali ladki audrey kii ore pranayshil pahal karata he or usase vivaah karne kaa prayaas karata he, par usase pehle hi anuchit hastkshep karne vaale jacks dwaara uski yojana vifal kar di jaati he
 Finally, Silvius, Phebe, Ganymede and Orlando get into a debate as to who will get whom
 genimad kahata he ki vah is samasya ko sulajhaa legaa, vah orlando or febe se yah vaada letaa he ki yadi febe genimad se vivaah nahin kar pai to ve kramshah roslind or silvius se shaadi kar lenge
 agle din, genimad swayan ko roslind ke rup main zaahir karata he or chunki febe kaa prem galat sabit hota he, use silvius ko apnaanaa padataa he
 Orlando sees Oliver in the woods and protects him from a lioness, which results in Oliver regretting his mistreatment of Orlando
 Oliver meets Alienna and falls in love with her and they decide to marry

 4 agast 1600 ko yah naatak stationurs company ke register main darj kiya gaya, lekin 1623 main first pholio main shaamil hone se pehle tak use mudrit nahin kiya gaya tha
 Arden is possibly the place name of a forest near Shakespeare's town of stratford-upon-avon
 oxford kaa shakespeare sanskaran tarksangat tareeke se is bhugolic visangati kii vyakhya yah maanate hue karata he ki 'arden' keval france ke vanachhadit kshetra ardennas kaa angrejikaran he or ise pratibimbit karne ke liye uske akshar vinyas ko badla gaya
 Other editions follow Shakespeare's 'arden' spelling, to argue that rural style portrays a singular world where geographical details are irrelevant
 shakespeare ke arden sanskaran kaa yah suzav he ki 'arden' naam kii utpatti arkedia ke parmparik kshetra or bible ke garden of eden ke sangyojan se hui he, kyonki naatak main parmparik or isai manyataon kaa majboot parsparik prabhaav he
 In addition, Shakespeare's mother's name was Mary Arden, and the name of the forest can thus be double meaningless
 punaruddhar ke purv vahaan iske pradarshan kaa koi bhi abhilekh nahin hai
 a possible performance of this, however, may be at Wilton House in Wiltshire, the rural site of the Earls of Pembroke
 pembroke ke tisare arl wiliam herbert ne oktober se disambar 1603 tak wilton house main james 1 or unke darbariyon kii mezbaani kii, jabaki jacobean landan bubonic plig kii mahamari se peedit tha

 Scholars have long disagreed about the merits of this drama
 Everyone, from critic Samuel Johnson to George Bernard Shaw, dissented that As You Like It lacked the artistry that Shakespeare was capable of
 shaw sochate the ki shakespeare ne is naatak ko aam logon ko santusht karne ke liye likhaa hoga or is kriti ke bare main apane madhyam vichaar kaa sanket use aiz you like it kehete hue diya - maano is raay se naatakkaar sahamat nahin the
 Tolstoy objected to the immorality of the characters and Touchstone's relentless senseless behavior
 Other critics found great literary values in this work
 herold bloom ne likhaa ki roslind shakespeare ke mahila paatro main sabase mahaan or sabase purnataa praapt mahila paatr he
 Despite critical controversies, the play remains one of Shakespeare's most important and frequently performed comedies
 kahani main vistrut ling vyutkraman ling adhyayanon main ruchi rakhane vaale aadhunik aalochakon ke liye vishesh rup se ruchikar hai
 In the play's four chapters, Rosalind - the role played by boys in Shakespeare's era - considers it necessary to disguise himself as a boy, while the rural woman, Phebe, becomes attracted to "ganymede", in whose name There is a homosexual sound
 vastav main, roslind dwaara darshakon se bataaye gayi upsanhaar main, spasht rup se yah prakat hota he ki vah ek mahila nahin he
 Professor Richard Knowles of the University of Wisconsin, who is the editor of the New Variorem version of the play in 1977, described in his article "myth and Type in As You Like It" how mythological references to the play, particularly Eden, Hercules and With reference to Christ
 However, he was unable to derive any concrete metaphorical meaning and therefore concluded that it could not be a metaphorical drama
 baharhaal, anya vidwaanon kaa daawa tha ki vastav main is naatak main lagaataar ek vyanjanapurna arth he or ise prastuti main badla ja saktaa he
 Issue two, scene 7, contains one of Shakespeare's most famous monologues, which states: yah prasiddh ekalaap jacks dwaara bolaa jaataa he
 It has a fascinating vision and ornamentation that can lead to the development of central metaphor, according to which: a person's life is a seven-digit drama
 ye ank, "saat dashaaen," "dai kii baahon main kilkaariyaan bharte or kai karte shishu" se shuru hoti hai or chah suspasht maukhik chitrankan ke madhyam se aage badhate hue "duusare bachapan or niri vismriti main / bedaant, netraheen, beswad, bina sabake" charam bindu par pahunchati he
 The theme of pastoral comedy is love in its form in the rural environment, real love embodied by Rosslind and unexpected events that divert urban courtiers in search of migration, consolation, or freedom, compared to Orlando's hypnotic sentimentality, suddenly occurring in the wilderness
 Is no more unrealistic than the encounters that provoke humorous jokes and Minister is not required to detail and character development

 Finally, Hymen himself comes to bless the wedding celebration
 wiliam shakespeare dwaara rachit naatak aiz you like it spasht rup se ek gramin romance style ke antargat aati he; parantu shakespeare keval style kaa istemaal hi nahin karte, balki unhen viksit karte the
 Shakespeare also used rural style to write As You Like It, so that he could take a critical view of social practices that create misery and injustice and mock antisocial, callous and suicidal behavior, most clearly Through the object of love, which results in the rejection of the concept of traditional uncivilized lovers
 paaramparik paristhitiyon main paariwarik paatr shakespeare va unke darshakon ke liye parichit vishay-vastu thi; vah to keval hajir javaabi or vishay kii vyapaktaa he jo paath ko budhimatta pradaan karti he, jo kaarywahi par ek tazaa mohar lagaati hai
 The optimism of Rosalind at the center of the play is compared with the feminine antagonism of Jacques
 baad main shakespeare ne kuch vishay-vastuon ko adhik gambhirtha se liya: anyaayi duk or nirvasit duk ne meshar for meshar or tempest ko vishay-vastu pradaan kiya
 Many directors have found that, a play which is based on sudden encounters in the jungle and many entangled love affairs and in which all events take place in a quiet rural setting, will be effective especially in places like a garden or uk
 donnovain ne "under di greenwood tree" ke sangeet ko taiyaar kiya or a gift from a flower tu a garden ke liye 1968 main record kiya
 Thomas Morley composed the music for "it Was a Lover and His Lesser", he and Shakespeare lived in the same locality, and he occasionally composed music for Shakespeare's plays

 Continental displacement is the movement of the continents of the earth in relation to each other
 yadi karodon varshon ke bhugolic yugon main dekha jaae to prathit hota he ki mahadweep or unke ansh samudr ke farsh par tike hue hai or kisi-na-kisi disha main bah rahe hai
 The concept of flowing continents was first revealed by Dutch scientist Abraham Ortelius in 1596, but in 1912 the German geologist Alfred Wegener developed it from independent studies
 aage chalakar plate vivartaniki kaa siddhant viksit hua jo mahadwipon kii chaal ko mahadwipiya pravaah se adhik acchhee tarah samajha paaya
 Abraham Ortelius, Theodore Christoph Lilienthal, Alexander von Humboldt, Antonio snyder-pellegrini, and others had already noted that the continents of both opposite ends of the Atlantic Ocean fit precisely into each other
 W
 J
 Kius described the idea of ortelius as: alfred vegener ne 1912 main yah pariklpana prastut kii ki mahadwipon ke tut kar pravaahit hone se pehle ve ekikrut bhoomikhand ke rup main the
 Wegener's theory was independent and more outstanding than that of his predecessors, with later Wegener crediting similar ideas to some older authors: Franklin Coxworthy, Roberto Mantovani, William Henry Pickering, and Frank Bursley Taylor
 udhaaharan ke liye: dakshini mahadwipon kii bhugarbheey samaantaaon se roberto mantovani ne 1889 va 1909 main yah anumaan lagaaya ki saare mahadweep pehle ek bahut bade mahadweep ke rup main ekatrit the ; vegener ne apane tathaa mantovani ke dakshini mahadwipon ke maanchitron main samaantaayen paayin
 jwalamukheey gatividhiyon ke kaaran hone vaale ooshmiya vistaar kii vajah se yah mahadweep tut gaya tathaa nae mahadweep ek duusare se dur pravaahit hone lage, kayonki daraar-kshetra, jahaan ab mahaasaagar hai, bhi badhate chale gaye
 For this reason Mantovani proposed the theory of the expanding Earth, which has since been shown to be false
 frank barsle tailor ne bina vistaar ke mahadwipiya pravaah ko prastaavit kiya, unhone 1908 main suzav diya ki mahadweep khatimay ke dauraan chandramaa ke gurutv bal se bumadhya rekha kii ore khinch gaye, isi kaaran himalay tathaa alps dakshin kii ore nirmit hue
 vegener ne kaha ki ye sabhi siddhant unke apane siddhant se kaaphi milte-julate hai, haalanki tailor kaa siddhant puri tarah se viksit nahin he
 Wegener was the first to use the term "continental flow" and the hypothesis was formally published that the continents somehow "flowed" and drifted away
 haalanki unhone mahadwipiya pravaah ke liye paryaapt sakshya die, parantu ve us bhautik prakriya kii vishwasaneey vyakhya nahin de paae jisaki vajah se yah pravaah utpann hua
 His suggestion that the continents be pulled by the centrifugal pseudo-force that arose due to the Earth's rotation or celestial solvation was rejected because calculations proved that this force was not sufficient for it
 polflukt pariklpana kaa paul sofus epstin dwaara 1920 main adhyayan kiya gaya or ise avishwasaneey paaya gaya
 There is now widespread evidence of continental flow
 vibhinn mahadwipon ke taton par milte-julate paudhe or pashuon ke jeevashm paae jane se aisa lagata he ki ve kabhi jude hue the
 An example of this is the discovery of fossils of Mesosaurus, a freshwater reptile that resembles a small crocodile in Brazil and South Africa; Another example is the fossil of a ground reptile named Lystrosaurus from contemporary rocks from various places in South America, Africa and Antarctica
 kuch jivit sakshya bhi hai - is donon mahadwipon par ek jaise kuch pashu paae jate hai
 For example, some families / species of some earthworms are found in Africa and South America
 dakshin america or africa ke saamne ke bhaagon kii poorak vyavastha spasht he, lekin yah ek asthaayee sanyog he
 In millions of years, the slab stretch and ridge pressure and other forces of tectonophysics will move and rotate these continents further away from each other
 These temporal features prompted Wegener to study what he defined as continental flow, although he did not survive until his hypothesis was accepted by the people
 dakshin america, africa, madagascar, arab, bharat, antarctica, tathaa australia main permo-carbonipheras himand talachat kaa vrihad vitaran mahadwipon ke pravaah kaa ek bada pramaan he
 The continuous glaciers formed by the Oriented glacial series and the taillights salt deposits confirm the existence of a very large continent Gondwana which is considered to be the central element of the theory of continental flow
 ye shrinkhlaayein aadhunik nirdeshaankon main bumadhya rekha se dur hoti hui tathaa dhruvon kii ore jaati hui himandeey bahaav ko darshaati hai, saath hi yah bhi pradarshit karti hai dakshini mahadweep bhootkaal main naatakeey rup se alag sthanon par the tathaa ek duusare se jude bhi hue the
 Although it is now believed that continents move on the surface of the Earth - although their motion is direction-oriented rather than moving in a direction-oriented direction, this flow has not been accepted theoretically for many years
 ek samasya yah thi ki koi vishwasaneey lagane vaali chaalan shakti nahin dikh rahi thi
 Also, Wegener's not being a geologist was a problem
 1953 main kaire dwaara plate tecotronic siddhant kaa parichay die jane se paanch varsh purv - mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant ko bhautikashastri shidigar dwaara nimnlikhit aadhaaron par kaarij kar diya gaya tha
 It is now known that there are two types of crust on Earth, the continental crust and oceanic crust, where the first one is of a different structure and lighter in origin, both types of crust are located on a far deeper fluidized mantle
 iske alaava, mahasagariya crust ab bhi failte hue kendron par ban rahi hai, tathaa yah sabdakshan ke saath, platon kii pranali ko avyavasthit rup se chalaata he jiske parinamswaroop satat orogeni tathaa isostetic asantulan utpann hota he
 The motion of all these and continents can be better explained by plate tectonics

 This story is also known as the story of Princess Kaguya due to her heroine
 yah kahani mukhyatah kaguya-hime naamak ek rahasyamay ladki ke jivan kaa vivaran he, jise ek chamakate baans ke ped ke andar shishu ke rup main paaya gaya tha
 One day, an old, childless bamboo logger named Taketori no Okina was passing through the forest
 use achaanak ek rahasyamay, chamakati hui baans kii danthal mili
 Upon cutting it open, he found an infant inside who was as big as his thumb
 itani sundar kanya paakar vah kush ho gaya or apane saath ghar le gaya
 He and his wife raised the child like their offspring and named her kaguya-hime
 uske baad, taaketori no okina ne paaya ki jab bhi vah baans ke danthan katata tha, andar sone kaa dala hota tha
 Gradually he became rich
 kaguya-hime ek nanhe shishu se badi hokar ek saadhaaran aakaar or asaadhaaran sundarataa vaali aurat bani
 Taketori no Okina tried to keep her away from outsiders, but over time the news of her beauty spread
 ant main paanch rajkumaar taaketori no okina ke ghar pahunche kaguya-hime se shaadi karne kaa prastaav lekar
 The princes slowly persuaded Taketori no Okina to choose kaguya-hime from any of those five
 kaguya-hime ne rajkumaron ke liye asambhav kaary rache, or kaha jo rajkumaar apana nirdhaarit vastu laaegaa, vah usase shaadi karegi
 That night, Taketori no Okina told the five who to bring
 pehle ko kaha gaya ki vah bharat se gautam buddha ke pathar ke bheekh kaa katoraa laae, duusare ko horai ke mithkeey dweep se ek abhooshit tahani, tisare ko china ke agni-mooshak ke vastra, chauthe ko dragon ke gale se ek rangeen mani, or paanchave ko chidiyon se janma ek kaudi
 The first Rahkumar understood that the task was impossible, so he brought an expensive bowl, but the bowl was not bright with divine light, so Kaguya-hise understood his trick
 isi tarah, do anya rajkumaron ne bhi use naqli vastuon se dhokhaa dene kii koshish kii par asafal rahe
 The fourth gave up after facing a storm and the fifth was killed in his attempt
 iske baad, japan ke samraat, mikaado, is asaadhaaran rup se sundar kaguya-hime ko dekhne aae, or mugdh hone ke baad, uske saamne shaadi kaa prastaav rakhaa
 She is not given an impossible task like princes, but kaguya-hime rejects her offer, saying that she is not of her country so cannot go to the palace with her
 vah samraat ke saath sampark main rahi, par unke nivednon or prastaavon ko kaarij karti rahi
 During that summer, whenever kaguya-hime looked at the full moon, her eyes filled up
 taaketori no okina or uski patni isse bahut chintit the or use poochhate the, par vah unhen apana dukh bataa nahin paati thi
 His behavior became more volatile until one day he revealed that he was not of this world and he would have to return to his people on the moon
 kahani ke kuch sanskarnon main kaha jaataa he ki use kisi aparaadh ke sazaa ke taur par prithvi bheja gaya tha, par kuch anyon main use ek akashiya yuddh ke dauraan surakshit rakhane ke liye bheja gaya tha
 The gold Taketori no Okina was getting was actually a salary sent from the moon to take care of kaguya-hime
 jaise-jaise uske vaapasi kaa din paas aata gaya, samraat ne uske ghar par paharedaar bheje taaki use chaand ke logon se dur rakhen, par jab "divya jeevon" kaa pratinidhi dal taaketori no okina ke darvaaze par pahunchaa, tab paharedaar ek ajeeb prakaash se andhe ho gaye
 kaguya-hime declares that even though she loves all her friends on Earth, she must return to her true home on the moon
 usne apane parijanon or samraat ke prati dukh bhare mafiname likhe, or parijanon ko apane vastra ek smarak ke rup main die
 Then he tasted the nectar lightly, attached it to his letter and gave it to an officer
 use khat dene ke baad, uske kandhon par pankhons kaa labaadaa rakhaa gaya, or vah prithvivasiyon ke prati apana sara dukh or dayaa bhul gai
 The celestial team then took him to Tsuki no Miyako, leaving his weeping parents
 taaketori no okina or uski patni atyant dukhi ho gaye or biimaar pad gaye
 The officer reached the emperor with the items given to kaguya-hime and explained the whole incident
 samraat uskaa khat padhakar dukh se bhar gaye
 He asked his servants "which mountain is the closest to heaven?", To which one replied "great mountain of Suruga province"
 samraat ne aadesh diya ki uske sevak us khat ko parvat kii chotii par le jaaen or jala den, is aashaa main ki unka sandesh rajkumaari tak pahunch jaae
 He also ordered Amrit to be burned, as he did not want to live forever without seeing kaguya-hime
 kaha jaataa he ki japani main amarta kaa shabd, 不死, hi parvat kaa naam ban gaya, fuji parvat
 It is also said that Kanji, the name of the mountain, has come to climb the mountain of the Emperor's army
 kehete hai ki khat ke jalane kaa dhuaan aaj bhi parvat ke chotii se nikalataa he
 Excerpts from the story are taken from old stories
 kahani ke nayak, taaketori no okina kaa naam ek puraane kavy sankalan maanayoshu main aata he
 In it, he meets a group of women and recites poems to them
 isse pataa chalata he ki baans lakadahaaron or akashiya mahilaon kii pracheen kathaayen maujuud hai
 Another form of this story is found in Konzaku Monogatorishu of the 12th century, but their relationship is a subject of debate
 1957 main jinyu fengauang prakashit hua, jo tibeti kathaon kii ek chini bhashi kitaab he
 In the 1970s, Japanese literary researchers discovered that Banzhu Guniang, a story in the book, had some similarities with the story of the bamboo logger
 shuruyaat main, kai shodhakartaaon ko laga ki bandu guniang kaa baans lakadahare kii kahani se zarur koi sambandh hoga, lekin kuch ko andeh tha
 Research in the 1980s showed that the relationship was not so straightforward
 okutsu ne shodh kii samiksha muhaiyaa kii he or paaya he ki jinyu fengauang bacchon ke liye prakashit kitaab he, isliye sampadak ne kuch kahaniyon main badlaav kiye the
 No other compilation of Tibetan stories has such a story

 a researcher in Sichuan found that local researchers in Chengdu, other than those who had read "jinyu Fenghuang", were not aware of this story
