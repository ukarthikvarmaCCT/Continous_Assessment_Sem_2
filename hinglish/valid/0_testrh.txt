 Count Mauni lived there for thirty years and during that time he hosted many famous people of the world
 mjedaar baat yah he ki usase pehle is dweep ko sthaneey cobra-damp mana jaataa tha kyonki srilanka main log sanpon ko maarthe nahin hai, isliye jitne bhi cobra pakde jate the unhen is dweep par chod diya jaataa tha
 Even after the death of the Count, it kept drawing many people towards it
 kuch-kuch samay ke liye kai logon ne ise apana ghar banaaya
 But slowly people started forgetting it

 This southern coast of Sri Lanka is a new attraction for tourists from all over the world as it gets almost the same scenery, experience and air that is found in Maldives or Thailand

 November to April is the best time to visit here because it does not rain these days
 lekin kai log yahaan barish kaa majaa lene bhi jate hai
 The rent for the suite here is $ 1,750 per night between the month of August and January 21 to April 30

 Fox's role began in January 1985 when Meredith Baxter returned to Family Ties after her delivery
 The people from the Back to the Future production team met Goldberg again, who had agreed that Fox's main priority would be family ties, and if a problem arises over time, he would listen to them
