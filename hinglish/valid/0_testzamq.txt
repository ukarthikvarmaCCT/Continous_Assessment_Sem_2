, nainital tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke nainital jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Vachspatiyam is the modern dictionary of Sanskrit
 iskaa sankalan tarkvachspati taranath bhattacharya ne kiya tha jo bengal ke rajkeey sanskrit mahavidhyalay main adhyaaapak the
 Its construction started in 1866 AD and ended in 1884 AD
 is prakaar isko puraa karne main 18 varsh lage
 It is a larger version of the Sanskrit dictionary than Shabdakalpadrum
 ech woodro ne apni 'vachanika' main is kosh kii visheshta bataate hue kaha ki "wilson" kii 'sanskrit dictionari' or 'shabdakalpadrum' kii apeksha iskaa kshetra vistrut or gambhiratar he
 Also, how many such words of tantra, philosophy, verses and theology are not in sanskrit-german-dictionary of 'roth Bothalingk'
 isamen yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki 'shabdakalpadrum' kaa pratham sanskaran bangla lipi main hua tha
 There are hundreds of thousands of words unavailable in the available dictionaries at that time
 saamaanya vaidic shabd to hai hi, saath hi aise bhi anek vaidic shabd he jo tatkaaleen shabdkoshon main aprapya hai
 Apart from conspiracies, it also includes the terminology of the less popular philosophies such as Charvaka, Madhyamika, Yogachara, Vaibhashika, Sautratrik, Arhat, Ramanuja, Madhva, Pashupat, Shaiva, Pratibhigya, Raseshwar
 puraanon or uppuraanon se sangruhit puraatan raajaaon kaa itihaas tathaa pratnayugin bhartiya bhugol kaa bhi isamen nirdesh hua he
 The technical terms and other descriptions of medicine have also been detailed
 ganit jyotish or falit jyotish ke paribhaashik shabd bhi hai
 Although the compilation of Vedic words has been attributed by Kaushakaar to the special importance of this dictionary, many Vedic words have also been omitted and the etymology and meaning of the majority of Vedic words are also self-evident
 'rathabothalingk' ke brihatsanskrit' shabdkosh ke upyog kaa bhi kaaphi praytn kiya gaya hai
 In short, we can say that by the creation of 'vachspatyam', such an enlarged and relatively larger version of the aforesaid 'shabdakalpadrum' came out, which in most respects from the point of view of composition, seeks to broaden and complete the dimension of 'vardakalpadrum'
 
 'tarkvachspati' ne nishchay hi jitna parishram kiya vah asaamaanya he
 His serious knowledge, talismanic manisha and wide-ranging virtue show astonishing amazement in it
 'shabdakalpadrum' kii adharpithika paakar bhi granthkaar ne koshkala ko 'shabdakalpadrum' kii style main kaaphi vyapak banaaya
 There is another feature targeted at it, rather than ‘shabdakalpadrum’
 'shabdakalpadram' main 'pad' subant tiqat die gaye hai
 The form of Prathama Ekabachan has been given the place of the word Vyakhyayya in the dictionary
 panratu 'vachaspatyam' main die gay shabd 'pad' na hokar 'pratipadik' athwa 'dhaaturup' main upanyast hai
 By the way, from the general point of view - from the idea of the method of creation - can be called the developed form of the word 'kalakpadrum' of 'vachspatiyam'
 'wilson' or 'monier williamy' ke koshon dbaara arthbodh, shabdarthgyan evam shabdaprayog kii soochna tathaa vyakhya-parak parichay sankshipt he, par upyogi rup main karaayaa gaya he
 But the semantics that emerged from the expansive background of citations by 'shabdakalpadrum' and 'vachaspatyam', although helpful in providing syntheses, have become encyclopedic through citations
 upyogitasapann hokar bhi saamaanya sanskritgyon ke liye— yah vyavaharik sauvidhya se rahit ho gaya he

 mahabharat hinduon kaa ek pramukh kavy granth he, jo smriti ke itihaas varg main aata he
 Sometimes it is simply called "india"
 yah kavyagranth bharat kaa anupam dharmik, puranic, aitihaasik or darshanik granth hai
 It is the world's longest literary text and epic, one of the main texts of Hinduism
 is granth ko hindu dharm main pancham veda mana jaataa he
 Although it is considered to be one of the most unique works of literature, even today, this book is an exemplary source for every Indian
 yah kriti pracheen bharat ke itihaas kii ek gaatha he
 In this, the most sacred book of Hinduism is contained in the Bhagavad Gita
 puure mahabharat main lagbhag 1,10,000 shloke hai, jo unani kaavyon elliod or odissi se pariman main das guna adhik hai
 According to Hindu beliefs, mythological references and the Mahabharata itself, the creator of this poem is considered to be Vedavas ji
 is kavy ke rachayita vedavyas ji ne apane is anupam kavy main vedon, vedangon or upanishdon ke guhyatam rahasyon kaa nirupan kiya hai
 Apart from this, justice, education, medicine, astrology, warfare, yogashastra, economics, architecture, craftsmanship, kamshastra, astronomy and theology are also described in detail in this poem
 vedavyas ji ko mahabharat puraa rachane main 3 varsh lag gayi the, iskaa kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki us samay lekhan lipi kala kaa itnaa vikaas nahi hua tha, us kaal main rishiyon dwaara vaidic granthon ko peedi dar peedi paramparaagat maukhik rup se yaad karke surakshit rakhaa jaataa tha
 Sanskrit was the language of the sages at that time and Brahmi was the language of common language
 is prakaar rishiyon dwaara sampoorn vaidic sahitya maukhik rup se yaad kar peedi dar peedi sahastron varshon tak yaad rakhaa gaya
 Then gradually, with the fall of the Vedic era due to the influence of time, the style of memorizing the Vedic literature of the sages disappeared, since then the practice of writing Vedic literature on manuscripts became safe
 yah sarvamaanya he ki mahabharat kaa aadhunik rup kai avasthaaon se guzar kar bana he
 Four early stages of its creation have been identified by scholars
 ye avasthaaen sambhavit rachana kaal kram main nimna likhit hai: Saraswati River dwarka Devi Saraswati Chav Tato Jayamudirayet
 
 The Mahabharata is a story of a war between two families of the Kauravas and the Pandavas of the Chandravanshi
 100 kaurav bhaaiyon or paanch pandav bhaaiyon ke bich bhoomi ke liye jo sangharsh chalaa usase antat: mahabharat yuddh kaa srijan hua
 Several different dates have been set by Indian and Western scholars of this war
 mukhya ullekh :mahabharat kii vistrut katha According to the Puranas, Brahma was born from Atri, Atri to the Moon, Moon to Mercury and Mercury to ila-nandan Pururava
 unase aayu, aayu se raja nahush or nahush se yayati utpann hue
 Purified by Yayati
 puru ke vansh main bharat or bharat ke kul main raja kuru hue
 Shantanu happened in the lineage of Kuru
 shantanu se ganganandan bhishma utpann hue
 From Shantanu, Chitrangad and Vichitravirya were born from Satyavati's womb
 chitrangad naam vaale gandharv ke dwaara maare gayi or raja vichitraveery rajyakshma se grast ho swargavaasi ho gayi
 Then by the order of Satyavati, Vyasji produced Dhritarashtra from the womb of Ambika and Pandu from the womb of Ambalika by Neog
 dhritarashtra ne gandhari dwaara sau putron ko janm diya, jinamein duryodhana sabase bada tha or pandu ke yudhistor, bhim, arjuna, nakul, sahadev aadi paanch putr hue
 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was made king in his place
 ek baar van main akhet khelte hue pandu ke baan se ek maithunarat mrigarupadhari rishi kii mrityu ho gayi
 Cursed by that sage, "now whenever you are maltreated, you will die", Pandu becomes very sad and abandons all lusts including his queens and makes Dhritarashtra in Hastinapur to live in the forest
 raja pandu ke kehane par kunti ne durvasa rishi ke diye mantra se dharm ko aamantrit kar unase yudhisthir or kaalaantar main vayudev se bhim tathaa indra se arjuna ko utpann kiya
 Madri gave birth to that mantra from Kunti and gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva from Ashwankumar
 ek din raja pandu maadri ke saath van main sarita ke tat par bhraman karte hue pandu ke man chanchal ho jane se maithun main pravruth huye jisase shaapvash unki mrityu ho gai
 Madri sati with them, but Kunti returned to Hastinapur for the upbringing of her sons
 kunti ne vivaah se pehle surya ke ansh se karn ko janm diya or loklaj ke bhay se karn ko ganga nadi main baha diya
 Adhiratha, the charioteer of Dhritarashtra, saved him and followed him
 karn kii ruchi yudhkala main thi atah dronacharya ke manaa karne par usne parashuram se shiksha praapt kii
 Duryodhana tried to kill the Pandavas many times in his childhood due to Shakuni's treachery and even in his youth, when Yudhishthira was made the crown prince, he tried to send the Pandavas to Lakshagraha, the home of Laksha, and burn them with fire, but the aid of Vidur
 Due to this, they got out of that burning house
 pandav vahaan se ekachakra nagari gayi or muni kaa vesh banaakar ek brahman ke ghar main nivas karne lage
 Then at the behest of Vyas ji, he went to Panchal kingdom where Draupadi was going to be a swayamvara
 vahaan ek ke baad ek sabhi raajaaon evam rajkumaron ne machhlee par nishaanaa saadhane kaa prayaas kiya kintu safalataa haath na lagi
 After this, Arjuna, seeing the reflection in Telapatra, penetrated Matsya with a single arrow and Draupadi went ahead and put a garland on Arjun's neck
 mata kunti ke vachananusaar paanchon pandavon ne draupadi ko patnirup main praapt kiya
 At the time of Draupadi's swayamvara, along with Duryodhana, Drupada, Dhritadhyumna and many others had suspected that they were only five Brahmin Pandavas
 atah unki pariksha karne ke liye drupad ne unhen apane rajaprasaad main bulaayaa
 In Rajprasad, Drupada and Dhrishtadyumna showed the first treasury but the Pandavas did not show any interest in Ratnabhushans and ratna-manikya etc
 kept there
 kintu jab ve shastraagaar main gayi to vahaan rakhe astr-shastron main un sabhi ne bahut adhik ruchi dikhaayi or apni pasand ke shastron ko apane paas rakh liya
 Their activity convinced Drupada that they are Pandavas as Brahmins
 draupadi swayamvar se purv vidura ko chhodkar sabhi pandavon ko mrit samajhane lage or is kaaran dhritarashtra ne duryodhana ko yuvaraj bana diya
 In order to avoid the crisis of civil war, Yudhishthira accepted Khandav forest as half the state in the ruins given by Dhritarashtra
 vahaan arjuna ne shrikrishna ke saath milakar samast devataaon ko yuddh main parrast karte hue khandvavan ko jala diya or indra ke dwaara kii hui vrishti kaa apane baanon ke chhatrakaar band se nivaaran karke agni dev ko trupt kiya
 As a result, Arjuna received the divine Gandiva bow and the best chariot from Agnidev and Shri Krishna received the Sudarshan Chakra
 indra apane putr arjuna kii veerta dekhakar atiprasann hue
 He removed the forests of Khandavaprastha
 uske uparaant pandavon ne shrikrishna ke saath may daanav kii sahaayta se us shahar kaa soundaryikaran kiya
 The city became like a second heaven
 indra ke kehane par dev shilpi vishwakarma or may daanav ne milakar khandav van ko indrapuri jitne bhavy nagar main nirmit kar diya, jise indraprastha naam diya gaya
 The Pandavas, while conquering all directions, performed a Rajsuya yagna, complete with abundant gold
 unka vaibhav duryodhana ke liye asay ho gaya atah shakuni, karn or duryodhana aadi ne yudhisthir ke saath jue main pravrutt hokar uske bhaaiyo, draupadi or unke rajya ko kapat dyut ke dwaara hanste-hanste jeet liya or kuru rajya sabha main draupadi ko nirvastr karne kaa prayaas kiya
 But Gandhari came and stopped this from happening
 dhritarashtra ne ek baar phir duryodhana kii prerana se unhen se jua khilne kii ajna di
 It was decided that whichever side would lose in a single stake, they would wear deer for twelve years and remain in exile for one year
 us ek varsh main bhi yadi unhen pahchaan liya gaya to phir se baarah varsh kaa vanvaas bhogana hoga
 Thus Yudhishthira, after being defeated in gambling, went to the forest with his brothers
 vahaan barahawaan varsh bitne par ek varsh ke agyatavaas ke liye ve viraat nagar main gayi
 When the Kauravas started carrying Virat's cows, they were defeated by Arjuna
 us samay kauravon ne pandavon ko pahchaan liya tha parantu unka kaa agyatavaas tab tak puraa ho chukaa tha
 But even after completing 12 years of known and one-year exile, the Kauravas refused to give the Pandavas their kingdom
 bhishma ne das dinon tak yuddh karke pandavon kii adhikansh sena ko apane baanon se maar giraaya
 Bhishma's death was subject to his will
 shrikrishna ke suzav par pandavon ne bhishma se hi unki mrityu kaa upaay poocha
 Bhishma said that the Pandavas fought the battle in front of Shikhandi
 bhishma use kanya hi maanate the or use saamne paakar wo shastr nahin chalaane vaale the
 And Shikhandi also had to avenge the humiliation of his previous birth and for that he took a boon from Shiva that Bhishma's death would be the reason
 10ve din ke yuddh main arjuna ne shikhandi ko aage apane rath par bithaaya or shikhandi ko saamne dekh kar bhishma ne apana dhanush tyaag diya or arjuna ne apni banvrishti se unhen baanon ki shayya par sula diya
 Then Acharya Drona assumed the charge of generalship
 phir se donon paksho main bada bhayankar yuddh hua
 Virat and Drupada etc
 were drowned in the sea by King Dronopi
 lekin jab pandavo ne chhal se dron ko yah vishwaas dilaa diya ki ashwatthama maaraa gaya
 So Acharya Drona was disappointed and gave up his weapon and left his body after taking yoga samadhi
 aise samay main dhridhyumna ne yoga samadhi liye dron kaa mastak talwaar se kaat kar bhoomi par gira diya
 After Drona slaughter, Karna became the captain of the Kaurava army
 karn or arjuna main bhanti-bhanti ke astr-shastron se yukt mahabhayanak yuddh hua, jo devasur-sangram ko bhi maat karne vaala tha
 In the battle of Karna and Arjuna, Karna killed many heroes of the enemy side with his arrows
 yadhyapi yuddh gatirodhpurna ho rahaa tha lekin karn tab ulajh gaya jab uske rath kaa ek pahiyaa dharti main dhans gaya
 Due to the curse of Guru Parshuram, he finds himself unable to use the divine weapons and comes down to remove the wheel of the chariot
 tab shrikrishna, arjuna ko uske dwaara kiye abhimanyu vadh, kuru sabha main draupadi ko veshya or uski karn vadh karne kii pratigya yaad dilaakar use maarane ko kehete he, tab arjuna ne ek divine astr se karn kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 Subsequently, King Shalya became the commander of the Kaurava army, but he could last only half a day in the war
 dopaher hote-hote raja yudhisthir ne unhen maar diya
 Duryodhana's entire army was killed, and in the end he had a miserable battle with Bhimsen
 bhim ne chhal se uski jaangh par prahaar karke use maar daalaa
 To take revenge of this, Ashwatthama put an Akshauhini army of Pandavas, the five sons of Draupadi, her Panchaldeshi brothers and Dhritadhyumna to sleep forever
 tab arjuna ne ashwatthama ko parrast karke uske mastak kii mani nikaal lee
 Ashwatthama then used Brahmastra on Uttara's womb
 uskaa garbh uske astr se praaia dagdh ho gaya tha, kintu bhagwaan shrikrishna ne usko pun: jivan-daan diya
 The same womb of Uttara later became known as King Parikshit
 is yuddh ke ant main kritavarma, kripacharya tathaa ashwatthama teen kauravapakshiya or paanch pandav, saatyaki tathaa shrikrishna ye saat pandavapakshiya vir jivit bache
 Yudhishthira then came to the throne
 brahmanon or gandhari ke shaap ke kaaran yadavakul kaa sanhaar ho gaya
 Balbhadra left his body with yoga and went into the ocean as Sheshnag
 bhagwaan krishna ke sabhi praputra ek din mahamuniyon kii shakti dekhne ke liye ek ko stri banaakar muniyon ke paas gaye or poocha ki he munishreshth! yah mahila garbh se he, hamen bataaen ki iske garbh se kiskaa janm hoga? muniyon ko gyaat hua ki yah balak unase krida karte hue ek purush ko mahila bana unke paas laae hai
 The sages cursed Krishna's great-grandchildren that a pestle will lick from this human's womb, which will end your dynasty
 krishna ke prapautron nen us moosal ko pathar par ragad kar chura bana nadi main baha diya tathaa uske nok ko phenk diya
 All of Krishna's great-grandchildren died from the leaves of the tree produced from that powder
 yah dekh shrikrishna bhi ek ped ke neeche dhyaan lagaakar beth gayi
 a hunter named 'zara' placed the tip of the pestle on the tip of his arrow and struck the arrow with the footstool of Lord Krishna as an antelope
 us baan dwaara krishna ke pair kaa chumban unke paramdhaam gaman kaa kaaran bana
 The Lord departed Goloka with his entire body
 iske baad samudr ne dwarkapuri ko apane jal main dubaa diya
 Subsequently, upon hearing the news of the destruction of the Yadavas from the mouth of Arjuna returning from Dwarka, Yudhishthira, considering the impermanence of the world, placed Parikshit on the Rajasana and took Draupadi and the brothers along the path of Mahaprasthana towards the Himalayas
 us mahapath main yudhisthir ko chhod sabhi ek-ek karke gir pade
 In the end, Yudhishthira climbed on Indra's chariot and went to heaven with his brothers

 sansaarik prem or desh-prem premchand kii pehali prakashit kahani he
 It was published in the April 1908 issue of Zamana, an Urdu magazine originating from Kanpur
 aam taur se premchand ke pehle kahani sangrah sozewatan main prakashit duniya kaa sabase anmol ratan ko unki pehali kahani mana jaataa rahaa he
 According to Dr
 Kamal Kishore Goenka, Sozevatan was published in June 1908, while worldly love and patriotism was published in April 1908
 yah kahani italy ke mashhoor rashtravaadi magini or uski premika megdalin ke jivan ko aadhaar banaakar likhi gai he
 It expresses the feeling of making a fiery struggle for the independence of the country
 yah vyaktigat prem par rashtraprem ko mahatta pradaan karne vaali kahani he
 1 In the arena of London's Badchalni, Italy's famous patriot Magini is concerned about the tyrannical rule and slavery of the country
 uske saath nirvasit dost italy ke amir kaa betaa rafeti apana nayaa kot christmas kii chintaa kiye bagaiyr girvee rakhkar kal shaam se na khaae jojeff ke liye biscuit or cigarette laata he
 Magini sold his girlfriend Magdalene's ring at the time of her illness
 2 christmas ke din sara landan khush he magar magini or rafeti andhere kamare main maayoos baithe hai
 Magini has not eaten and has not received a cigarette since morning
 tabhi megdalin ke khat main christmas kaa uphaar baalo kaa ek guchha aayaa
 Anindya Sundari daughter of a Swiss nobleman became acquainted with Magini during her few days there and then fell in love
 kintu magini ne swayan ko desh par nyochaavar kar diya tha
 So he refused Magdalene's plea to accept himself and began to run around worrying for the nation's interests
 magini ne jabaabi patr main khud ko magadonil ke liye anupyukt mana or use bahan kehete hue tohfe ke liye shukr adaa kiya evam uske swasthya kii dua kii
 3 Long after this, a public state was announced in Italy and three persons, including Magini, were appointed to look after the state
 magar france kii jyadatiyon or pidmant ke badshaah kii dagaabaaziyon ke kaaran janata kaa rajya bikhar gaya or magini rome kii galiyon kii khaakh chaanane laga
 His friends Rafetti, Rasarino, Palino, Barnabas etc
 showed opportunity and duped him
 ve magadonil se bhi magini kaa bura kehete rahe magar usne yakeen nahin kiya
 Magini's call for himself was made him more prestigious in Magdonil's heart
 magar yah hikmat magini ne hi kii thi
 So that Magdonil takes care of him from his heart
 asar ulataa hua or magadonil rome ke ek sarai main aa thahari
 She saw Magini happy from a distance, but when she was hit by failures, she found him
 6 magini rome se landan jaakar bahut din rahaa or phir sicily ke aakrosh kii khabar sunakar vidroh kaa netritv karne ke liye sicily ja pahunchaa
 But the rebellion was suppressed there
 shahi fouj ne use jahaaj se utarate hi giraftaar kar liya or phir mar jane ke bhay se buudhe magini ko reeha kar diya
 Magini started publishing newspapers in Switzerland to spread awareness among the public
 ek saal baad hi alps parvat kii talahati main swasth laabh ke liye landan jate samay nimonia se uski mrityu ho gai
 Magdonil offered flowers to her tomb and opened an ashram in her name to serve Muflis women and poor girls
 uskaa ashram kisi bhi navagantuk ke liye apane ghar jaisaa tha
 He died three years later and according to his vocation he is buried in the same ashram
