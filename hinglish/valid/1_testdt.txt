 Mohammad Rafi was born on 24 December 1924 near Kotla Sultan Singh, Amritsar
 aarambhik balykaal main hi inkaa parivaar lahore se amritsar aa gaya
 His family had nothing to do with music
 jab rafi chote the tab inke bade bhai kii nai dukaan thi, rafi kaa kaaphi vakt vahiin par gujarata tha
 It is said that when Rafi was seven years old, he followed a fakir passing through his elder brother's shop who used to sing from there
 uski aawaaj rafi ko pasand ai or rafi uski nakal kiya karte the
 People also liked his voice after seeing avalata in his copy
 log nai dukaan main unke gane kii prashansha karne lage
 But Rafi got nothing but local fame from this
 inke bade bhai mohammad hamid ne inke sangeet ke prati inaki ruchi ko dekha or unhen ustad abdul vaahid khan ke paas sangeet shiksha lene ko kaha
 Once Akashwani came to Lahore to perform his famous singer-actor Kundan Lal Sehgal
 isko sunne hetu mohammad rafi or unke bade bhai bhi gaye the
 Sehgal refused to sing due to the power failure
 rafi ke bade bhai ne aayojakon se nivedan kiya kii bheed kii vyagrata ko shant karne ke liye mohammad rafi ko gane kaa mauka diya jaay
 He got permission and this was Mohammad Rafi's first public performance at the age of 13
 prekshkon main shyaam sundar, jo us samay ke prasiddh sangeetkaar the, ne bhi unako suna or kaaphi prabhavit hue
 He invited Mohammad Rafi to sing for himself
 mohammad rafi kaa pratham geet ek punjabi film gul baloch ke liye tha jise unhone shyaam sundar ke nirdesan main 1944 main gaaya
 In 1946, Mohammad Rafi decided to come to Bombay

 Rafi got fame in the Hindi world for the first time with the song Tera Toy Broken by Naushad
 iske baad shahid, mela tathaa dulaari main bhi rafi ne gane gaae jo bahut prasiddh hue
 In 1951, when Naushad was composing songs for the film Baiju Bawra, he thought of losing his favorite singer Talat Mehmood
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone ek baar talat mahmud ko dhumrapaan karte dekhakar apana man badal liya or rafi se gane ko kaha
 Baiju Bawra's songs established Rafi as a mainstream singer
 iske baad naushaad ne rafi ko apane nirdesan main kai geet gane ko die
 Around this time, the composer duo shankar-jaikishan liked his voice and also started singing songs from Rafi
 shankar jaykishan us samay raaj kapur ke pasandida sangeetkaar the, par raaj kapur apane liye sirf mukesh kii aawaaj pasand karte the
 Later, when the demand for Shankar Jaikishan's songs increased, he used Rafi Sahab almost everywhere
 yahan tak kii kai baar raaj kapur ke liye rafee sahab ne gaaya
 Soon, music composer Sachin Dev Burman and notably OP Nayyar got very pleased with Rafi's voice and started singing Rafi
 o pi naiyyar kaa naam isamen smaraneey rahegaa kyonki unhone apane niraale andaaj main rafi-aashaa kii jodi kaa kaaphi prayog kiya or unki khanakati dhune aaj bhi us jamaane ke anya sangeetkaaron se alag prathit hoti hai
 Rafi gained a lot of fame with the songs sung under his direction and then became the first choice of composers like Ravi, Madan Mohan, Ghulam Haider, Jaydev, Salil Chaudhary, etc
 dilip kumaar, bharat bhushan tathaa devanand jaise kalakaaron ke liye gane ke baad unke gaanon par abhinay karne waalo kalakaaron kii suchi badhati gai
 For artists like Shammi Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar, Joy Mukherjee, Vishwajeet, Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra etc
 Rafi's voice started echoing in the background
 shammi kapur to rafi kii aawaaj se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone apane har gane main rafi kaa istemaal kiya
 While OP Nayyar gave music for him, Shankar Jaikishan sometimes voiced his voice
 chaahe koi mujhe junglee kahe, ehsaan tera hoga mujhapar, ye chand sa roshan cheharaa, divaana hua badal shammi kapur ke upar filmaae gaye lokapriy gaanon main shaamil hai
 Gradually, his fame grew so much that actors started urging him to sing the song
 rajendra kumaar, dilip kumaar or dharmendra to maanate hi nahin the ki koi or gayak unke liye gaae
 
 1950 ke dashak main shankar jaykishan, naushaad tathaa sachindev burman ne rafi se us samay ke bahut lokapriy geet gavaaye
 This trend continued into the 1960s
 sangeetkaar ravi ne mohammad rafi kaa istemaal 1960 ke dashak main kiya
 In 1960, Rafi received his first Filmfare Award for the title song of the movie Chaudhvi Ka Chand
 iske baad gharaana, kaajal, do badan tathaa neelkamal jaisi filmo main in dono kii jodi ne kai yaadgaar nagamen die
 In 1961 Rafi got his second Filmfare Award for Sasural's song Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko
 sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant pyarelal ne apana aagaaz hi rafi ke swar se kiya or 1963 main film parasmani ke liye bahut sundar geet banaae
 Be safe in these and it is remarkable when remembered
 1965 main hi lakshmi-pyaare ke sangeet nirdesan main film dosti ke liye gaae geet chaahunga mai tuje sanjh savere ke liye rafi ko teesraa filmphere puraskaar mila
 In 1965, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India

 1960 ke dashak main apane kariyar ke sheersh par pahunchane ke baad dashak kaa ant unke liye sukhad nahin rahaa
 In 1969, Shakti Samanta was producing a film called Aradhana for which he chose Sachin Dev Burman as the composer
 isi saal dada biimaar pad gaye or unhone apane putr rahul dev burman= avarohan ==1960 ke dashak main apane kariyar ke sheersh par pahunchane ke baad dashak kaa ant unke liye sukhad nahin rahaa

 Both these songs became very popular and actor Rajesh Khanna of this song became very popular among the directors and public
 saath hi gayak kishor kumaar bhi janata tathaa sangeet nirdeshkon kii pehali pasand ban gaye

 Mohammed Rafi is also known for his greatness
 wo bahut hansmukh or dariyadil the tathaa hameshaa sabaki madad ke liye taiyaar rahete the
 He sang many film songs without taking any money or with very little money
 apane shuruaati dinon main sangeetkaar jodi lakshmikant-pyarelal ke liye unhone bahut kam paison main gaaya tha
 His dispute with Lata Mangeshkar over the royalty of the songs is also indicative of his generosity
 us samay lataji kaa kahana tha ki gane gane ke baad bhi un gaanon se hone vaali aamadani kaa ek ansh gayakon tathaa gayikaon ko milanaa chahie
 Rafi saheb was against this and said that once the songs have been recorded and the singer-singers have been paid their fees, they should not expect any more money
 is baat ko lekar dono mahaan kalakaaron ke bich manmutav ho gaya
 Lata refused to sing on the set with Rafi and for years no duet song came out
 baad main abhinetri naragis ke kehane par hi dono ne saath gaanaa chaalu kiya or jewel thief film main dil pukaare gaanaa gaaya
 He died due to cardiac arrest on 31 July 1980
 rafi ne apane jivan main kul kitne gane gaae is par kuch vivaad he
 In the 1970s, the Guinness Book of World Records wrote that Lata Mangeshkar was responsible for recording the most songs, recording a total of 25,000 songs
 rafi ne iskaa khandan karte hue gineez book ko ek chitthee likhi
 Subsequent editions featured the claims of the two singers simultaneously and credited Muhammad Rafi for recording 28,000 songs between 1944 and 1980
 iske baad hui khoj main vishwaas nerurkar ne paaya ki lata ne vastav main 1989 tak keval 5,044 gane gaae the
 Other researchers have also accepted this fact as true
 iske atirikt raju bharatan ne paaya ki 1948 or 1987 ke bich keval 35,000 hindi gane ricard hue
 It is difficult to believe that Rafi sang 28,000 songs, but some sources still cite this number
 is shodh ke baad 1992 main gineez book ne gayan kaa uparokt ricard book se nikaal diya

 Rajendra Singh Sarsanghchalak Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh rajju bhaiya kii sangh yatra asaamaanya he
 He came to Prayag in his youth with a vigilant and fully developed merit power in his youth

 paas karte hi ve prayag vishvavidhyalay main vyaakhyaata pad paane ke saath-saath prayag ke nagar kaayrvah kaa daayitv sanbhaalane kii sthiti main pahunch gayi
 Prayag Department's proceedings in 1946, Jail Yatra in 1948, Divisional Affairs in 1949 comprising two three departments, Province Work in 1952 and Bhaurao Deoras in 1954, took over the responsibility of the entire province after leaving the province
 1961 main bhaurav ke waapas lautne par praant-prachaarak kaa daayitv unhen waapas dekar sah praant-prachaarak ke rup main pun:unke sahyogi bane
 If the scope of Bhaurao expanded, then again from 1962 to 1965, the responsibility of Uttar Pradesh's pracharak, from 1966 to 1974, he was the field-preacher and field-preacher
 1975 se 1977 tak apatkaal main bhumigat rahakar loktantr kii vaapasi kaa aandolan khadaa kiya
 When he became a co-government in 1977, Madhavrao Mule was also given the responsibility of head-work in March 1978
 1978 se 1987 tak is daayitv kaa nirvaah karke 1987 main ho0 ve0 sheshadri ko yah daayitv dekar sah-sarkarywah ke rup main unke sahyogi bane
 In 1994, when the then Sarsanghchalak Bala Saheb Deoras started looking for his successor due to his declining health, everyone's eyes were fixed on Rajju Bhaiya and on 11 March 1994, Bala Saheb automatically handed over the top responsibility of Sarsanghchalak to him
 sangh ke itihaas main yah ek asaamaanya ghatana thi
 The eyes of the publicity media and the critics of the Sangh were torn by seeing this scene
 unhen vishwaas hi nahin ho rahaa tha ki jis rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par ve ab tak maharashtriyan brahmanon ke ekadhikaar kii chhavi thopate aaye hai, uske shikhar par uttar bharat kaa koi gaiyr-maharashtrin abrahman pahunch saktaa he - vah bhi sarvasammati se
 Rajju Bhaiya's body was diseased and relaxed at that time, but he made a lot of effort to fulfill the responsibility entrusted to him
 parantu ahernish kaary or samaaj-chintan se buree tarah tut chuke apane sharir se bhala or kab tak kaam liya ja saktaa tha
 Therefore, in 1999, he made up his mind to hand over the responsibility to someone younger
 or ant main apane sahyogiyon ke aagrahpurn anurodh kaa aadar karte hue ek varsh kii pratiksha ke baad, march 2000 main sudarshan ji ko yah daayitv saupakar svaichhik pad-sanyas kaa sangh ke samaksh ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Rajju Bhaiyya's 60-year long Sangh Yatra is not only unusual in terms of how he has successfully carried out huge responsibilities one after the other, but also with the view that from 1943 to 1966 he was with teaching work at Prayag University- Like a full-time evangelist, he wandered from place to place, carrying out all the responsibilities
 sangh-kaary hetu apni kshamta ko badhaane ke liye ve sangh shiksha varg main teen varsh ke paramparaagat prashikshan par nirbhar nahin rahe
 He received his first year training in 1947 when he had reached the status of city stewardship of Prayag
 Had prepared for tritiy varsh unhone 1957 main kiya jab ve uttar pradesh jaise bade praant kaa daayitv sanbhaal rahe the
 It is clear from this that he did the formality of training for three years to present a worthy example in front of other volunteers of the Sangh, not to gain merit for himself
 prayag vishvavidhyalay main padhaate hue bhi ve sangh-kaary main prachaarkavat jute rahe
 He was formally declared a pracharak in 1958, but the truth is that he himself gave the role of pracharak to the office of stewardship
 bhautik shaastra jaise good vishay par asaamaanya adhikaar rakhane ke saath-saath atyant saral va rochak adhyaapan style or apane shishyon ke prati sneh bhaavana ke kaaran rajju bhaiya prayag vishvavidhyalay ke sarvaadhik lokapriy or safal praadhyaapak the
 Due to seniority and qualification, he also had to hold the responsibility of the post of chairman of the department along with the professor
 kintu yah sab karte hue bhi ve sangh-kaary main apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah puri tarah karte rahe
 He never wished to become a reader or a professor
 jin dinon prayag vishvavidhyalay main bhautikee vibhaag ke reader pad ke liye aavden maange gayi unhone aavedan patr hi nahin diya
 The colleagues asked that Rajju brother! Why did you do it? So he answered very easily - "oh my life work is union work, not a university professor
 abhi main saptaah main chaar din kakshayen letaa hoon, teen din sangh-kaary ke liye daura karata hoon
 Sometimes even after trying hard, the university is unable to reach on time
 abhi to vibhaag ke sab adhyaaapak meraa sahyog karte hai kintu yadi main reader pad par abhyaarthee bana to ve mujhe apana pratispardhi samajhane lagenge
 So why get stuck in this digestion
 " rajju bhaiya kaa sampoorn jivan is baat kaa sakshi he ki unhen pad kii aakanksha athwa uskaa moh kabhi rahaa hi nahin
 Even as a teacher in the university, he did not earn for himself
 ve apane vetan kii ek-ek pai ko sangh-kaary par vyay kar dete the
 Even after being born into a rich family, getting education in public schools, interest in sports like music and cricket, he used to spend least on himself
 mitvyayta kaa ve apurv udhaaharan the
 At the end of the year, whatever was left of his salary, he was offered to the society as guru-dakshina
 ek baar rashtradharm prakaashan aarthik sankat main fas gaya to unhone apane pitaaji se aagrah karke apane hisse kii dhanrashi dekar rashtradharm prakaashan ko sankat se ubaara
 This was an expression of his all-round sanity! ni:swaarth sneh or nishkaam karm sadhana ke kaaran rajju bhaiya sabake priy tha
 Both within and outside the union
 purushottam das tandon or laal bahadur shastri jaise rajanetaaon ke saath-saath prabhudutt brahmacharee jaise santon kaa vishwaas or sneh bhi unhone arjeet kiya tha
 Along with a very sensitive conscience, Rajju Bhaiyya was also very realistic
 ve kisi se bhi koi bhi baat nixsancoach kah dete the or unki baat ko taalna kathin ho jaataa tha

 Argument collection is a treatise containing both justice and Vaisesika philosophy

 Through its study, one gets the knowledge of all the basic principles of justice and Vaiseshika
 is granth main 'padaarthon' ke vishay main jo kuch he vah purnat: vaisheshik ke anusaar he jabaki 'pramaan' ke vishay main jo kuch he vah purnat: nyaay ke anusaar he
 That is, the 'special vote' has been accepted for the substances and the 'justice vote' for the evidence
 is prakaar is granth ke madhyam se nyaay or vaisheshik mat ko ek main milaayaa gaya he
 Annambatta composed the ninth book titled Tarkasangraha with the aim of making the children knowledge of justice pleasantly and with the intention of clarifying its overarching meaning, he also wrote an interpretation book called Deepika

 kintu yogeekaran kii prakriya se N≡N bandh se nitrogen parmaanu ko mukt kar detaa he or yah mukt nitrogen duusare tareekon se upyog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Nitrogen fixation is essential for vegetative and some other organisms because inorganic nitrogen is required for basic formation of organisms, and for biological synthesis
 Therefore, as part of the nitrogen cycle, it is necessary for agriculture and fertilizer manufacturing
 It is, indirectly, essential for the manufacture of all nitrogen-containing chemical compounds, including explosives, most medicines, and chemical dyes
 nitrogen yogikikaran sookshm jeevanu, jaise ezotobacter, dwaara mitti main prakritik rup se kiya jaataa he

 The addition of organic nitrogen occurs through the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia by an enzyme called nitrogenase
 In free-living diazotrophs, nitrogen-generated ammonium glutamine synthetase / glutamate synthesizes into glutamate via the synthase pathway
 nitrogen yogikeekaran ke liye aavashyak microbial jin prakruti main vyapak rup se vitarit hoti hai
 Enzymes responsible for nitrogenase addition are often susceptible to oxygen and oxygen can cause their destruction

 kashmir shaiva mat main is tyohaar ko har-raatri or bolchaal main 'herath' yaa 'herath' bhi jaataa he
 There are many mythological stories related to Mahashivaratri: mahashivaratri ke din bhagwaan shiv ne kalkut naamak vish ko apane kanth main rakh liya tha
 Which came out at the time of churning the sea
 ek baar parvati ji ne bhagwaan shivashankar se poocha, 'aisa koun-sa shreshth tathaa saral vrath-pujan he, jisase mrityulok ke praani aapaki krupa sahaj hi praapt kar lete hai?' uttar main shivaji ne parvati ko 'shivaratri' ke vrath kaa vidhaan bataakar yah katha sunai- 'ek baar chitrabhanu naamak ek shikari tha
 He raised his family by killing animals
 vah ek sahuukaar kaa rini tha, lekin uskaa rin samay par na chukaa sakaa
 The angry moneylender captives the hunter at Shivamath
 sanyog se us din shivaratri thi
 ' shikari dhyanamgn hokar shiv-sambandhi dharmik baaten sunata rahaa
 He also heard the story of Shivaratri fast on Chaturdashi
 sandhya hote hi sahuukaar ne use apane paas bulaayaa or rin chukaane ke vishay main baat kii
 The hunter left the bond the next day, promising to return the loan
 apni dincharya kii bhaanti vah jangal main shikaar ke liye niklaa
 But due to being in captivity all day, he was disturbed by hunger and thirst
 shikaar karne ke liye vah ek talab ke kinare bel-vriksh par padaav banane laga
 Under the vine tree was the Shivling which was covered with villas
 shikari ko uskaa pataa na chalaa
 The twigs he broke while making the halt fell on the Shivling by chance
 is prakaar dinabhar bhukhe-pyaase shikari kaa vrath bhi ho gaya or shivlinga par belptr bhi chadh gaye
 At one o'clock in the night, a pregnant lady came to drink water at the pond
 shikari ne dhanush par tir chadhaakar jyon hi pratyancha khinchi, mrigi boli, 'main garbhini hum
 Will deliver soon tum ek saath do jeevon kii hatya karoge, jo thik nahin he
 i will give birth to a child and will be presented to you soon, then kill it
 ' shikari ne pratyancha dhili kar di or mrigi junglee jhaadiyon main lupt ho gai
 Shortly after, another antelope emerged from there
 shikari kii prasannataa kaa thikaana na rahaa
 After coming close, he put the bow on the arrow
 tab use dekh mrigi ne vinamratapurvak nivedan kiya, 'he pardhi! main thodi der pehle ritu se nivrutt hui hum
 i am lustful
 apane priy kii khoj main bhatak rahi hum
 i will meet my husband and come to you soon
 ' shikari ne use bhi jane diya
 He was perturbed over losing his prey twice
 vah chintaa main pad gaya
 The last hour of the night was passed
 tabhi ek anya mrigi apane bacchon ke saath udhar se nikali
 It was a golden opportunity for hunters
 usne dhanush par tir chadhaane main der nahin lagaai
 He was about to drop the arrow that the antelope said, 'O Pardhi!' i will return these children to their father
 is samay mujhe mat maaro
 The hunter laughed and said, leave the victim in front, i am not such a fool
 isse pehle main do baar apana shikaar kho chukaa hum
 My children must be suffering from hunger and thirst
 uttar main mrigi ne phir kaha, jaise tumhen apane bacchon kii mamata sata rahi he, thik vaise hi mujhe bhi
 Therefore, in the name of children, i am seeking life for a while
 he pardhi! meraa vishwaas kar, main inhen inke pita ke paas chhodkar turant lautne kii pratigya karti hum
 Hearing the deer's low voice, the hunter felt pity on him
 usne us mrigi ko bhi jane diya
 In the absence of hunting, the hunter sitting on the vine tree was being thrown down by breaking the bell-sheet
 pau fatne ko hui to ek hrisht-pusht mrug usee raste par aayaa
 The hunter thought that he would surely hunt it
 shikari kii tani pratyancha dekhakar mrigvinith swar main bolaa, he pardhi bhai! yadi tumne mujhase purv aane vaali teen mrigiyon tathaa chote-chote bacchon ko maar daalaa he, to mujhe bhi maarane main vilamb na karo, taaki mujhe unke viyog main ek kshan bhi dukh na sahanaa pade
 i am the husband of those deer
 yadi tumne unhen jeevandaan diya he to mujhe bhi kuch kshan kaa jivan dene kii krupa karo
 i will meet you and appear before you
 mrug kii baat sunate hi shikari ke saamne puri raat kaa ghatnachakra gum gaya, usne sari katha mrug ko suna di
 Then the deer said, 'the way my three wives have gone as promised, i will not be able to follow my religion with my death
 atah jaise tumne unhen vishwaasapaatr maanakar choda he, vaise hi mujhe bhi jane do
 i will appear before you soon with all of them
 ' upwas, raatri-jaagran tathaa shivlinga par belptr chadhane se shikari kaa hinsak hriday nirmal ho gaya tha
 Bhagavad Shakti was in him
 dhanush tathaa baan uske haath se sahaj hi chhot gaya
 Due to the compassion of Lord Shiva, his violent heart filled with compassionate feelings
 vah apane ateet ke karmon ko yaad karke pashchaatap kii jwaala main jalane laga
 Shortly afterwards, the antelope appeared before the family hunter, so that he could hunt them, but the hunter was very sorry for seeing such veracity, sattvikta and collective love of wild animals
 uske netron se aansuon kii jhadi lag gai
 By not killing that antelope family, the hunter removed his hard heart from living violence and made him soft and kind forever
 devloak se samast dev samaaj bhi is ghatana ko dekh rahe the
 As soon as the event ended, the Gods and Goddesses made flowers
 tab shikari tathaa mrug parivaar moksh ko praapt hue'

 internet sambandhi paton kii sanrachana main, privet network ek aisa network he jo refsi 1918 or refsi 4193 dwaara nirdhaarit maanakon kaa anusaran karte hue privet ypi adress spes kaa istemaal karata he
 These addresses are typically used for home, office, and enterprise local area networks when remittable addresses via a global route are not required or unavailable for the required network applications
 privet ypi paton ke sthanon ko mul rup se ipivi4 paton ke shunyikaran ko vilambit karne ke ek prayaas main paribhaashit kiya gaya tha lekin inhen agali peedi ke internet protocol, ipivi6 main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 These addresses are defined as private because they are not delivered globally, meaning that they are not allocated to a specific organization and IP packets addressed by them are not transmitted over the public Internet
 
 in paton kaa istemaal koi bhi riginal internet registry se sweekruti ke bagaiyr kar saktaa he
 If such a private network needs to be connected to the Internet, it is mandatory to use either a network address translator gateway or a proxy server
 in paton kaa sabase saamaanya upyog awasaiya networkon main hota he, chunki zyaadaatar internet seva pradaata prayek awasaiya graahak ko keval ekmaatr maarg se bheje jane yogya ypi pataa aavantit karte hai, lekin zyaadaatar gharon main ek se adhik network upkaran hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye, kai computer or ek video game consol
 is sthiti main ek eneti getwe kaa istemaal aam taur par kai upyogkartaaon ke liye internet sampark ko sakasham banane main kiya jaataa he
 Private addresses are also commonly used in corporate networks that are not directly connected to the Internet for security reasons
 network ke aantarik upyogkartaaon ko internet kii simit pahunch pradaan karne ke liye aksar ek proxi, socks getwe yaa isi tarah ke anya upkarnon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In both cases, private addresses are often seen as better security for internal networks because it is difficult for an Internet host to directly connect to an internal system
 kyonki kai nijee network ek samaan ypi pate kaa istemaal karte hai, is tarah ke networkon ko ek saath milaane main ek aam samasya paidaa hoti he, paton ke sthanon kaa takaraav yani kai upkarnon par paton kii nakal kaa taiyaar ho janaa
 is maamle main network ko anivaary rup se dubaara number dena chahie jo aksar ek samay lene vaala kaary he, yaa nakal kiye gaye paton ko chupaane ke liye networkon ke bich ek eneti router ko rakhaa janaa chahie
 It is not uncommon for packets made in private addresses to leak on the Internet

 The AS 112 project tried to reduce this load by arranging special blackhole anicast nameservers for private addresses that provide only negative result codes to answer these questions
 sanghathanaatmak kshetra ke routeron ko aam taur par in networkon ke liye ypi trephic ke aagaman ko kam karne ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya tha jo yaa to achaanak ho saktaa tha yaa phir ek nakli strot pate kaa istemaal kar mailicious trephic ke jariye aisa kiya ja saktaa tha
 ISP edge routers stop the release of such traffic from customers, which reduces the impact on the Internet of those malicious hosts or malicious hosts on the customer's network, but is much less frequent
 internet ejineering task force ne internet esind nambers othority ko privet networkon ke liye nimnlikhit ipivi4 paton kii range ko arakshit rakhane kaa nirdesh diya he, jaisaa ki refsi 1918 main prakashit kiya gaya he: Classful addressing is now obsolete and has not been used in the Internet since the introduction of classless inter-domain routing introduced in 1993

 The concept of reservation of private networks and special addresses for such networks has been transferred to the next generation of protocol Internet ipv6

 These addresses are called unique local addresses
 inke charitra ko unicast ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he or do privet networkon ko aapas main jodne par hone vaale takkar ko rokane ke liye rooting prifics main ek 40-bit random number maujuud rahata he
 Despite being inherently local in use, the ipv6 address scope of unique local addresses is global
 pate, section "ipivi6 adress scops"
) An earlier standard proposed the use of so-called "site-local" addresses in the fec0 :: / 10 range, but the use of RFC 3879 by September 2004 was inappropriate due to major scalability concerns and a poor definition of the site
 is
 ek anya prakaar kii nijee netwarking refsi 5735 or refsi 3927 main samhitabaddh local-link adress range kaa upyog karti he
 The utility of these addresses is in self-automated configuration by network devices when dynamic host configuration protocol services are not available and manual configuration by a network administrator is not desirable
 ipivi4 main block 169
254 / 16 is uddeshy ke liye arakshit he jahaan is range main pehla or antim / 24 sabanet apwaadon ke rup main he
 If the IEEE 802 network is unable to obtain a network address through DHCP, an address from 169

 Tulu is a popular language in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts located in the western side of Karnataka state of India and in some parts of North Kerala
 pehle tulu brahman vaidic or sanskrit sahitya likhane ke liye 'tiglri' naamak lipi ko upyog karte the
 But very little literature is found in Tulu language
 par aaj is lipi ko jaananevaale bahut kam hai
 The old Tigallari script closely resembles the Malayalam script
 ab tulu likhane ke liye kannada lipi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 This Panch is one of the Dravid languages
 dakshin kannada or udupi jilon kii adhikansh logon kii maatrubhaasha tulu he
 Hence, both these districts are collectively known as Tulunadu
 kerala ke kasargod jile main bhi bahut log tulu bhashaa bolte hai
 a Brahmin from Udupi district has composed a book named 'bhagavata' using the Tigari script
 kavi mandaar keshav bhat ne 'mandaar ramayana' naam kaa ek aadhunik mahakavy likhaa he
 According to linguists, there are four major forms or styles of tulu: shivalli - tulu brahmanon kii bolanewaali style
 Jains - The speaking style of Jains from the northern parts of Tulunadu
 saamaanya - tulunadu ke zyaadaatar logon kii bolanewaali style
 This style is used in commerce, art, entertainment
 adivasee - adivasee logon kii bolanewaali style
 According to some old Malayalam works, the area which spread from the Chandragiri River in Kasaragod to Gokarna in Uttara Kannada was known as Tulunadu
 par aaj kaa tulunadu dakshin kannada or udupi jilon tak hi simit he
 Nevertheless, many people who speak Tulu are found in Kasaragod in Kerala and Mumbai and Thana in Maharashtra
 vartmaan samay main tulubhashik sahitya likhane ke kaary main kannada lipi kaa upyog hota he
 Arabic: علي ابن أبي طالب ali ibne abi talib kaa janm 17 march 600 musalamaanon ke tirth sthal kaaba ke andar hua tha
 He was the brother-in-law and brother-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and his popular name is Hazrat Ali
 ve musalamaanon ke khalipha ke rup main jane jate hai
 He ruled from 656 to 661 as the fourth caliph of Rashidun Khilafat, and according to Shia Islam, he was the first Imam from 632 to 661
 iske atirikt unhen pehla muslim vaigyanik bhi mana jaataa he
 He gave scientific information in a very interesting manner to the common man
 abu talib or fatima bin asad ke liye paidaa hue, kai shastreey islamic ke anusaar, islam main sabase pavitra sthaan makka main kaaba ke pavitra abhayaarany main paidaa hone vaala ali akelaa vyakti he
 Sources, especially Shia ones
 ali pehla purush tha jisane islam ko sweekaar kiya, or kuch lekhakon ke mutabik pehla muslim tha
 Ali protected Muhammad from an early age and took part in almost all the battles fought by the nascent Muslim community
 madina main jane ke baad, usne mohammad kii beti fatima se vivaah kiya
 After the assassination of Caliph Uthman ibn Afan, he was appointed a caliph by Muhammad's companions in 656
 ali ke shasankaal main naagarik yuddh hue or 661 main, do dinon baad shahid hone ke kaaran kupha ke mahaan masjid main prarthana karte hue kharijite ne un par hamalaa kiya or hatya kar di 
 Ali is important for both Shia and Sunni politically and spiritually
 ali ke bare main kai jeevani strot aksar sampradayik rekhaon ke anusaar pakshpatpurna hote hai, lekin ve is baat se sahamat hai ki vah ek pavitra muslim tha, jo islam ke kaaran or quran or sunnat ke anusaar ek shaasha tha
 While Sunis consider Ali the fourth and final of the Rashidun Caliph, Shia Muslims consider Ali as the first Imam after Muhammad because of his interpretation of events in the Ghadir Khum
 shiya muslim bhi maanate hai ki ali or anya shiya imam ke sadsy hai) mohammad ke liye sahi uttaradhikari hai 
 It was a disagreement that the ummah was divided into Shia and Sunni branches
 ali ke pita, abu talib, shaktishaalee kuraishi janajati kii ek mahatvapurn shakha banu hashim ke kaaba ke sangrakshak the or ek shaikh the
 He was also an uncle of Muhammad, and raised Muhammad after Abdul Muttalib
 ali kii maa fatima bin asad bhi banu hashim se sambandhit thim, jisase ali ibaihim ibrahim ke putr ke vanshaj the
 Several sources, especially Shi, testify that Ali was born inside the Kaaba in Mecca City, where he lived with his mother for three days
 kaaba kaa daura karte hue unki maa ne apane shram dard kii shuruyaat mahasoos kii or jahaan unke bete kaa janm hua, vahaan pravesh kiya
 Miraculous details of Ali's mother's accession are in the Kaaba in some Shia sources
 kaaba main ali kaa janm shiya ke bich apane "ucch aadhyatmik stesan" ko sabit karne vaala ek anoothaa kaarykram mana jaataa he, jabaki vibhinn sunni vidwaanon main yah ek mahaan mana jaataa he, yadi adwitiya, bhed nahin he
 According to one tradition, Muhammad was the first person Ali saw as he took a newborn baby in his hands
 mohammad ne unhen ali naam diya, jiskaa arth he "mahaan"
 Muhammad had a close relationship with Ali's parents
 jab mohammad anaath ho gaye or baad main apane dada abdul mutalib ko kho diya, ali ke pita ne unhen apane ghar le liya
 Ali was born two or three years after Muhammad married Khadijah bint Khuwaylid
 jab ali paanch varsh kaa tha, to mohammad ne use uthaae jane ke liye ali ko apane ghar le liya
 Some historians say that this was because there was a famine in Mecca at that time and there was a large family to support Ali's father; Others, however, point out that Ali did not bear the burden on his father, as Ali was five years old at the time, and despite the famine, Ali's father, who was financially well-off, served food to strangers Were known if they were hungry
 jabaki yah vivaadit nahin he ki mohammad ali uthaae, yah kisi bhi vittiya tanaav ke kaaran nahin tha ki ali ke pita ja rahe the
 Ali had been living with Muhammad and Muhammad's wife Khadija since the age of five
 jab ali nau varsh kaa tha, mohammad ne khud ko islam ke paigambar ke rup main ghoshit kiya, or ali islam ko sweekaar karne vaala pehla baccha ban gaya
 He was the second person after Khadija to accept Islam
 islam or musalamaanon ke itihaas ke punargathan main said ali asagar rajwi ke anusaar, "ali or quran 'mohammad mustafa or khadija-tul-kubra ke ghar main 'judawaan'ke rup main bade ho gaye
 " ali kii jindagi kii duusari avadhi 610 main shuru hui jab unhone 9 saal kii umr main islam ghoshit kar diya or mohammad ke hijra ke saath 622 main madina ke saath samaapt ho gaya
 When Muhammad reported that he had received a divine revelation, Ali, at the age of nine, believed him and claimed Islam
 ali islam ko gale lagane vaale pehle purush bane
 The Shia doctrine asserted that in keeping with Ali's divine mission, he accepted Islam before taking part in any pre-islamic Mecca traditional religion rites, considered by Muslims as polytheistic or pagan so Shia About Ali says that his face is respected, because it never departs from presentations in front of idols Was
 sunni bhi sammanit karam allaah vajahu kaa upyog karte hai, jiskaa arth he "uske chehre par bhagwaan kaa anugrah
 "his acceptance is often called conversion because he was never an idol worshiper like the people of Mecca
 vah ibrahim ke dhaanche main murtiyon ko todane ke liye jane jate the or logon se poocha ki unhone apni khud kii kuch chizon kii puja kyon kii
 Ali's grandfather, along with some members of the Bani Hashim clan, was a follower of the Hanif, or monotheistic belief system, before Isph's arrival
 mohammad ne unhen saarvajanik rup se aamantrit karnaa shuru karne se teen saal pehle logon ko islam main gupt rup se aamantrit kiya tha
 In the fourth year of Islam, when Muhammad was ordered to invite his close relatives to come to Islam, he gathered the Banu Hashim clan in a ceremony
 bhoj main, vah unhen islam main aamantrit karne ja rahaa tha jab abu lahab ne use baadhit kar diya, jiske baad har koi bhoj chhod gaya
 The Prophet ordered Ali to invite 40 people again
 duusari baar, mohammad ne islam kii ghoshnaa kii or unhen shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya
 he told them, main unki dayaa ke liye allaah ko dhanyavad detaa hum
 i praise Allah, and i seek his guidance
 main us par vishwaas karata hum or maine us par apana bharosa rakhaa he
 i bear witness that there is no God except Allah; He has no partners; And i am his messenger
 allaah ne mujhe aapako apane dharm main aamantrit karne kaa aadesh diya he: or apane nikatatam rishtedaaron ko chetavanee dijie
 Therefore, i warn you, and call you to prove that there is no God but Allah, and i am his messenger
