 keval calcium, barium, straunsium or sis ke lavan jal main aviley yaa bahut kam viley hote hai
 Many salts are of industrial importance
 barium or sis salphet varnak ke rup main, sodium salphet kaagaj nirmaan main, copper salphet kitnashak ke rup main or calcium salphet plaster ov paris ke rup main prayukt hote hai
 There is no action of concentrated acid on sis and steel
 at: amla ke nirmaan main tathaa amla ko rakhane ke liye sis tathaa ispaat ke paatr prayukt hote hai
 Small quantities of sulfur can be prepared in laboratories in the following three ways: gandhak trioxide ko jal main ghulaane se, By the direct action of hydrogen peroxide and sulfur dioxide - vaayu ke sansarg main salfuras amla ke vilyan ke mand oxikaran se
 At the industrial level, acid is produced by sis-chamber method and contact method
 sansparsh vidhi main gandhak athwa aayran salphid sadrush kisi salphid ke dahan se sulfur dioxide pehle banataa he or vah platinum dhatuyukt esbestas utprerak kii upasthiti main vaayu ke oxigen dwaara gandhak trioxide main parinat ho jaataa he, jo jal main ghulkar gandhakaml banataa he
 In this method, acid is formed by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide by nitric acid in the presence of water
 yah kriya-bade bade sis kakshon main sampann hoti he at: iskaa naam 'sis-kaksh-vidhi' padaa he
 This method was used to make a large amount of sulfuric acid, but it has some shortcomings due to which the contact process has now replaced it
 bade paimaane par gandhakaml ke nirmaan kaa pehla kaarkaana 1740 i
 main landan ke sameep richmond main ward naamak vaigyanik dwaara sthapit kiya gaya tha
 For manufacture, a mixture of sulfur and sorrel was heated in an iron vessel and acid vapors were collected in glass containers containing water
 is prakaar se praapt tanu amla ko baalu ooshmak ke upar kaanch ke paatro main sandra kiya jaataa tha
 After some time, six-foot-wide SIS chambers were used in place of the soon-to-break glass vessels
 holker naamak vaigyanik ke ayak parishram dwaara 1810 i

 From the top of this column, a mixture of sulfur and nitrosyl sulfur is available
 stambh se nikalakar gas mishran sis kaksh main pravesh karata he
 Generally, SIS chambers remain three
 yahan kaksh main bhaap bhi pravesh karata he
 Acting between the gas mixture and the steam, it forms a sulfuric acid, which collects in the bottom of the chamber
 avshisht gaise ab ge-lusac stambh main pravesh karti hai
 They mainly contain nitrogen oxides
 ge-lusac stambh coke yaa pathar ke tukdon se bharaa rahata he
 The sulfurium drips from the top and slowly falls due to blockage, absorbing nitrogen oxides, nitrosyl sulfur is formed and used in the glover column
 is prakaar nitrogen ke oxidon kii kshati bachaai jaati he
 The acid obtained from the sis chamber is impure
 ashuddhiyon main arsonic, nitrogen ke oxide tathaa kuch lavan hote hai
 Such acid is mainly used in the manufacture of fertilizer
 iske liye shuddh amla aavashyak nahin he
 Such acid is cheaper
 gandhak amla nirmaan kii duusare reeti sansparsh vidhi he
 The acid obtained by this method is more pure and concentrated
 iskaa vikaas 1889-90 i
 main nitz naamak vaigyanik ne kiya tha
 Germany's Badische aniline and soda fabric company first prepared acid with this method, so it is also known as Badische method, or Badische process
 sansar ke adhikansh gandhakaml kaa nirmaan aajkal sansparsh vidhi se hi hota he
 It can give any concentration of acid
 is vidhi main gandhak ko jalaakar, athwa pirietiess ko uttapt kar, gandhak dwizarkik praapt hota he
 It is mixed with air and brought to the catalyst, where sulfur is combined with oxygen from the secondary air to form sulfur trioxide
 gandhak trioxide ko sandra gandhakaml main avashoshit karaane se "olium' praapt hota he
 The desired concentration of acid is obtained by the reaction of oleum with water
 utprerak ke rup main pehle sookshm vibhajit platinum prayukt hota tha
 It was very expensive
 jab platinum ke sthaan main vanadium pentoxide prayukt hota he, jo platinum kii apeksha bahut sasta hota he
 In order to reduce the reactivity of the catalyst, it is necessary that sulfur dioxide is absolutely free from arsenic, ash and dust particles
 at: gandhak dwizarkik ke chaanane kaa prabandh rahata he or use aise padaarthon dwaara paarit kiya jaataa he jinamein arsenic purnataya nikal jaae
 If the gas is not purified, the catalyst's functionality may soon be lost
 utprerak kaksh main jo gaisen pravesh karti hai unamem gandhak dwizarkik, oxigen or nitrogen rahete hai
 In vertical characters, the catalyst is retained
 vahaan kriya sampann kar nikalati gas ko sandra gandhakaml main avashoshit karaayaa jaataa he
 It gives oleum
 olium main shat prati shat gandhakaml ke atirikt 40 pratishat tak adhik gandhak trioxide avashoshit rah saktaa he
 By adding the required amount of water, it can obtain the acid of the desired concentration
 sansparsh vidhi se amla nirmaan ke anek sanyantr bane hai, jinase adhik shuddh or kam kharch main amla praapt ho saktaa he
 Such plants are now built which can produce 600 tons of acid in 24 hours
 inaki dekhbhaal ke liye kuch hi vyakti paryaapt hote hai
 More than one ton of high pressure combined steam, or superheated steam, per ton of acid is required
 prati ton 100 amla kii prapti ke liye 35 kilowat bijli or 4,000 galen thande jal kii aavashyaktaa padati he

 The Navayans are a sect of Buddhism, built by the Indian Buddhist leader Bhimrao Ambedkar
 navyan kaa arth he - "nayaa maarg" yaa "shuddh vaahan"
 All the followers of this Buddhism are "ambedkarite Buddhists", these Buddhists are considered to be compulsory and important to follow the twenty-two vows prescribed by Ambedkar, which Ambedkar gave the conversion ceremony of 14 October 1956
 ambedkar ke in dharm parivarthit buddha anuyaayion ko bharat sarkaar tathaa anya rajya rajya sarkaron ne "navabuddha" naamak sangya de rakhi hai
 The Navayana sects Mahayana, Theravada and Vajrayana etc
 differ in some respects, but in this only the scientific principles and the rational / rational principles are taken with the basic principles of Buddha out of these three sects
 navyan main jatipratha, varnbhed, lingabhed, andhvishwaas tathaa kuritiyon ko koi sthaan nahin hai
 As of 2011, the majority of Indian Buddhists constitute 87% of Navyani Buddhists
 anya anumaano ke anusaar, bharat main bharat main navayani baudhon kii aabaadi 5 se 7 karod tak hai
 a day before Ambedkar accepted Buddhism, the journalist asked, 'will Buddhism be the Mahayana Buddhist or Hinayana Buddhism?' In reply Ambedkar said, "my Buddhism will neither be Mahayana nor Hinayana, both these sects have some superstitious things, so my Buddhism will be Navyaan Buddhism
" jisamen kisi buddha ke mul siddhant or keval vivekwaadi siddhant hi honge, koi bhi kuritiyon yaa andhvishwaas nahin honga
 It will be a 'pure Buddhism'
 ’’ patrkaar ne phir poochhaan, “kya ham ise 'bhimyan' kah sakate hai?” ambedkar ne kaha kii, aap kah sakate hai kintu main nahin kahunga
 Because i don't want to bring myself up like Gautama Buddha
 haalanki bharat ke navayani buddha bodhisattva ambedkar tathaa gautam buddha ko hi sanmaan dete he, kyonki ve ambedkar ko apane aadhyatmik netaa tathaa buddha ko apane guru maanate he
 In present-day India whenever Lord Buddha is remembered, then naturally Bhimrao Ambedkar is also named
 bhartiya swatantraaa ke baad bahut badi sankhya main ek saath dow ambedkar ke netritv main samudayik buddha dhamm parivartan hua tha
 The initiation took place in Nagpur on October 14, 1956, in which 5,00,000 supporters of Ambedkar became Buddhists, the next day 2,00,000 and on the third day on October 16, 300,000 followers became Buddhists in Chandrapur
 is tarah 10 lakh se bhi adhik logon to ambedkar ne keval teen din main buddha banaaya tha
 This event led to the revival or rebirth of Buddhism in India
 ek anumaan ke anusaar march 1959 tak 1
5 se 2 karod log buddha bane the
 Buddhism is one of the major religions of India and informally is the third largest religion in India
 bhagwaan buddha or unka dhamm yah bhartiya buddha anuyaayion kaa dharmagranth hai, jise dow bhimrao ambedkar ne likhaa hai
 Apart from this, Tripitaka and Adi Buddhist texts are considered important by Buddhist followers

 hindu daliton ke 936 kii tulana main baudhon ke bich mahila or purush kaa ling anupaat 953 prati hajaar he
 This proves that the status of women in Buddhist families is far superior to that of Hindu Dalits
