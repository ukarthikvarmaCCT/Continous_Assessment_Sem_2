 But he says that following one of these Imams is not mandatory
 unki jo baaten quran or haddees ke anusaar hai us par amal to sahi he lekin kisi bhi vivaadaaspad chiz main antim faisalaa quran or haddees kaa maananaa chahie
 Ahle Hadith alias Salafi alias Wahhabi, for this reason, do not accept beliefs like triple talaq and halala because the proof is not found in the Quran or Hadith

 International relations theory studies international relations from a theoretical perspective
 yah ek aisa vaicharik dhaancha pradaan karne kaa prayaas karata he jisase antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa vishleshnatmak adhyayan kiya ja sake
 Ole Holsti states that the principles of international relations act as a pair of colored sunglasses, which allows the person wearing them to see only events relevant to the main principle
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main yatharthwaad, udaarvaad or rachnawad, teen sabase lokapriy siddhant hai
 Theories of international relations can be divided mainly into two theories, "positivist / rationalist" who focuses primarily on state-level analysis
 or uttar-pratyakshvaadi / chintansheel jo antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhant main uttar aupniveshik yug main suraksha, varg, ling aadi ke vistaarit arth ko shaamil karwaanaa chaahate hai
 44 xxrep 4 3 There are often many conflicting modes of thought in IR theories, such as constructivism, institutionalism, Marxism, neo-gramscianism, and others in international relations
 haalanki, pratyakshvaadi siddhanton ke skulon main sabase adhik prachlit yatharthwaad or udaarvaad hai
 However, constructivism is becoming increasingly mainstream in international relations

 The distinction between interpretive and constructivist approaches in the theory of international relations is seen when we classify the principles of international relations
 vyaakhyaatmak siddhant ve hai jo siddhant nirmaan ke liye bahari duniya ko saidhantik drushti se dekhte hai
 Constructive theories are those that believe that theories actually help build the world
 yatharthwaad yaa raajnneetik yatharthwaad, antarrashtriya sambandhon ke shikshan kii shuruyaat ke baad se hi antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa pramukh siddhant rahaa he
 This theory claims to rely on ancient traditional approaches, including authors such as Thucydide, Machiavelli, and Hobbes
 praarambhik yatharthwaad ko adarshavaadi soch ke khilaaf ek pratikriya ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Realists saw the outbreak of World War II as a proof of their lack of idealistic thinking
 aadhunik yathartwaadee vichaaron main vibhinn kismein hai, haalanki, is siddhant ke mukhya siddhanton ke rup main rajya niyantran vaad, astitv or swayan sahaayta ko mana jaataa he
 Realism has many important beliefs
 yathartwaadee maanate hai ki raashtra - rajya is arajak antarrashtriya pranali main aikik va bhugolic aadhaarit abhinayta hai, jahaan koi bhi vaastavik aadhikarik vishwa sarkaar ke rup main maujuud nahin he jo in raashtra- rajyon ke bich antah kriya yaa sahabhaagitaaon ko viniyamit karne main sakasham ho
 Secondly, it considers sovereign states to be the primary actors in international affairs rather than intergovernmental organizations, international organizations, ngos, or multinationals
 is prakaar, rajya hi, sarvocch vyavastha ke rup main, ek duusare ke saath pratispardhaa main rahete hai
 As such, a state acts as a rational autonomous actor in maintaining its existence, ensuring its own security and in pursuit of its own selfishness with these primary objectives and thereby its sovereignty and existence
 Attempts to protect
 yathartwaadee maanate hai ki raashtra rajya apane hiton kii khoj main, apane liye sansadhano ko ekatra karnaa karne kaa prayaas he or ye rajyon ke bich ke sambandhon ko satta ke apane sambandhit staron dwaara nirdhaarit karte hai
 This level of power is determined by the military, economic and political capabilities of the state
 maanav swabhaav yathartwaadeeyon kaa maananaa he, ki rajya swaabhaavik rup se hi aakraamak hote hai atah kshetreey vistaar ko shaktiyon kaa virodh karke hi aseemabaddh kiya gaya he
 Whereas other offensive / defensive realists believe that states are always concerned about the security and continuity of their existence
 rakshaatmak drushtikon ek suraksha duvidha kii taraf le jaataa he, kyonki jahaan ek raashtra khud kii suraksha ko badhaane ke liye hathiyaar banataa he, to vahiin pratidwandvi bhi saath hi saath samanaantar laabh praapt karne kii koshish karata he
 So this process can lead to more instability
 Safety can only be seen as a zero-sum game / zero-accumulation game, where only relative advantage can be found
 nav yatharthwaad yaa sanrachanaatmak yatharthwaad, kenneth waltz dwaara apni pustak antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke siddhant main ise yatharthwaad ke hi unnat vikaas ke rup main prastut kiya tha
 Joseph Grieco has associated neo-realist ideas with more traditional realists
 siddhant kaa yah prakaar kabhi kabhi "aadhunik yatharthwaad" bhi kaha jaataa he
 Waltz's neo-realism states that the effect of structure should be taken as explaining state behavior
 sanrachana ko do roopon main paribhaashit kiya gaya he, pratham-antarrashtriya pranali kaa vyavastha siddhant, jo kii araajaktaa liye hue he or doosraa- ikaayiyon main kshamtaaon kaa vitaran
 Waltz also challenges traditional realism that emphasizes traditional military power rather than the combined capabilities of the state as demonstrative power
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ke udaaravaadi siddhanton kaa agradoot "adarshavaad" tha
 Idealism which saw itself as a criticism of realists
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main, adarshavaad ek vaicharik drushtikon he jo yah maanata he ki ek rajya ko apni videsh niti kaa lakshya nirdhaarit karne ke liye ise apane aantarik raajnneetik darshan main apnaanaa chahie
 For example, an idealist may believe that to alleviate poverty at home, as well as abroad, poverty must be worked together

 kurukshetra yuddh kauravon or pandavon ke madhya kuru samrajya ke singhaasana kii prapti ke liye ladaa gaya tha
 According to Mahabharata, almost all the districts of India participated in this war
 mahabharat va anya vaidic saahitiyon ke anusaar yah pracheen bharat main vaidic kaal ke itihaas kaa sabase bada yuddh tha
 Millions of Kshatriya warriors were killed in this war, which resulted in the collapse of Vedic culture and civilization
 is yuddh main sampoorn bharatvarsh ke raajaaon ke atirikt bahut se anya deshon ke kshatriya veeron ne bhi bhaag liya or sab ke sab vir gati ko praapt ho gayi
 As a result of this war, India lacked both knowledge and science as well as heroic Kshatriyas
 ek tarah se vaidic samskruti or sabhyataa jo vikaas ke charam par thi uskaa ekaek vinaash ho gaya
 The golden Vedic civilization of ancient India came to an end with the end of this war
 is mahaan yuddh kaa us samay ke mahaan rishi or darshanik bhagwaan vedavyas ne apane mahakavy mahabharat main varnan kiya, jise sahasrabdiyon tak sampoorn bharatvarsh main gaakar evam sunakar yaad rakhaa gaya
 In the Mahabharata, there are accounts of the war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, mainly of two families of lunar dynasties
 100 kauravon or paanch pandavon ke bich kuru samrajya kii bhoomi ke liye jo sangharsh chalaa usase antat: mahabharat yuddh kaa srijan hua
 The said war is believed to have taken place around Kurukshetra in Haryana
 is yuddh main pandav vijayi hue the
 In the Mahabharata, this war has been called the Crusade, because it was a war fought for truth and justice
 mahabharat kaal se jude kai avshesh dilli main purana kila main mili hai
 Purana Qila is also called the fort of Pandavas
 kurukshetra main bhi bhartiya puraatatva surveykshan vibhaag dwaara mahabharat kaal ke baan or bhaale praapt hue hai
 7000-3500 years old submerged cities have been discovered on the west coast of Gujarat, which have been linked with references to Dwarka mentioned in Mahabharata, apart from the remains of Lakshagriha in Barnava, all these evidences prove the reality of Mahabharata
 
 mahabharat yuddh hone kaa mukhya kaaran kauravon kii ucch mahatvakankshaayen or dhritarashtra kaa putr moh tha
 The Kauravas and the Pandavas were siblings
 vedavyas ji se niyog ke dwaara vichitraveery kii bharya ambika ke garbh se dhritarashtra or ambalika ke garbh se pandu utpann hue
 Dhritarashtra gave birth to a hundred sons from Gandhari's womb, Duryodhana being the eldest
 pandu ke yudhisthir, bhim, arjuna, nakul, sahadev aadi paanch putr hue| dhritarashtra janm se hi netraheen the atah unki jagah par pandu ko raaj diya gaya jisase dhritarashtra ko sadaa pandu or uske putron se dwesh rahane laga
 This malice flourished as Duryodhana and Shakuni made ghee in this fire
 shakuni ke kehane par duryodhana ne bachapan se lekar laakshagrih tak kai shadyantra kiye
 But every time he failed
 yuvavastha main aane par jab yudhisthir ko yuvaraj bana diya gaya to usne unhen laakshagrih bhijwakar maarane kii koshish kii parantu pandav batch nikle
 In the absence of the Pandavas, Dhritarashtra made Duryodhana the crown prince, but when the Pandavas returned and sought their kingdom back, they were given a ruined Khandav forest in the name of the state
 dhritarashtra ke anurodh par grihayuddh ke sankat se bachane ke liye yudhisthir ne yah prastaav bhi sweekaar kar liya
 The Pandavas built Indraprastha, the grand city of Indra's Amaravati Puri, with the help of Shri Krishna
 pandavon ne vishwavijay karke prachur maatra main ratna evam dhan ekatrit kiya or rajasuya yajna kiya
 Duryodhana could not see the progress of the Pandavas and with the help of Shakuni, he won his entire kingdom from Yudhishthira in gaming and humiliated Draupadi by attempting to disarm Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha
 sambhavtah isi din mahabharat ke yuddh ke beej pad gayi the
 Finally, after losing in gaming, the Pandavas had to accept confinement for 12 years and one year of exile
 parantu jab yah shart puri karne par bhi kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya
 So the Pandavas had to be interrupted to fight, but Shri Krishna suggested to do everything possible to stop the war
 tab shrikrishna pandavon kii taraf se kururajya sabha main shantidoot banakar gayi or vahaan shrikrishna ne duryodhana se pandavon ko keval paanch gaanv dekar yuddh taalane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 But when Duryodhana refused to give the Pandavas as much land as the needle point, Yudhishthira was eventually forced to fight
 is prakaar kauravon ne 11 akshuhinee tathaa pandavon ne 7 akshuhinee sena ekatrit kar lee
 After completing the preparations for the war, both the Kaurava and the Pandavas reached Kurukshetra, where this fierce battle was fought, that terrible and fierce exterminatorial war of Kurukshetra can be inferred from a verse in Bhishma festival of Mahabharata
 bhrata bhraataram tatra swasriyan na c matulah
 Even after fulfilling the condition of 12 years of life and 1 year of unknown life, when the Kauravas refused to give their kingdom to the Pandavas, the Pandavas were forced to fight
 parantu shrikrishna ne kaha ki yah yuddh sampoorn vishwa sabhyataa ke vinaash kaa kaaran ban saktaa he atah unhone yuddh rokane kaa har sambhav prayaas karne kaa suzav diya
 Sri Krishna said that Duryodhana must give one last chance, so Sri Krishna went on behalf of the Pandavas as a peacekeeper in the Kurujya Sabha and proposed to avoid war by giving Duryodhana only five villages in front of the Pandavas
 jab duryodhana ne pandavon ko sui kii nonk jitani bhi bhoomi dene se manaa kar diya to shrikrishna ne use samajhaayaa ki duryodhana ke is hath ke kaaran uske vansh or saathiyon ke saath-saath kai nirdosh logon ko yuddh kii bali chadhana padegaa
 Enraged at this, Duryodhana tried to make Sri Krishna a prisoner, but Shri Krishna used Maya to frighten everyone out of his vast form and left
 iske baad to yudhisthir ko yuddh karne ke liye vivash hona hi padaa
 At the same time, Lord Ved Vyas went to Dhritarashtra and said that your sons, by disregarding the talk of all the gurus, finally put up a great destructive war
 dhritarashtra ke yuddh kii sansuchana jaanane kii vinati karne par vedavyas ji ne unhe kaha ki yadi tum is mahayuddh ko dekhnaa chaahate ho to main tumhen divya drushti pradaan kar saktaa hoon
 Dhritarashtra said that the destruction of my family is to be done in it, so i will not see this war with my own eyes
 atah aap krupa karke aisi vyavastha kar den ki mujhe is yuddh kaa samachar miltaa rahe
 Hearing this, Ved Vyas called Sanjay and gave him a divine vision and said, “oh Dhritarashtra! i have given Sanjay a divine vision
 sampoorn yuddh kshetra main koi bhi baat aisi na rahegi jo isse chuphi rahe
 This will tell you the whole story of this great war
 ” itnaa kahkar vedavyas ji chale gayi
 When it was decided that there would be war, both sides started preparations for war
 duryodhana pichle 13 varshon se hi yuddh kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha, usne balram ji se gada yuddh kii shiksha praapt kii tathaa kathin parishram or abhyaas se gada yuddh karne main bhim se bhi acha ho gaya
 Shakuni turned most of the districts of the world in these years
 duryodhana karn ko apni sena kaa senapati bananaa chahta tha parantu shakuni ke samajhane par duryodhana ne pitamah bhishma ko apni sena kaa senapati banaaya, jiske kaaran bharat or vishwa ke kai janapad duryodhana ke paksh me ho gayi
 On the Pandavas side, only those districts were in favor of religion and Shri Krishna
 mahabharat ke anusaar mahabharat kaal main kururajya vishwa kaa sabase bada or shaktishaalee janapad tha
 All the districts of the world never made the mistake of going to war with Kurujya and maintained a cordial relationship
 at: sabhi janapad kuruon dwaara labhanvit hone ke lobh se yuddh main unki sahaayta karne ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 When the Pandavas and Kauravas asked for help from the Yadavas, Sri Krishna first vowed not to take up arms in the war and then said that "on one side i am alone and on the other side i have an Akshauhini Narayani army", now Arjuna and Duryodhana elect one of these Had to do
 arjuna ne to shrikrishna ko hi chunaa, tab shrikrishna ne apni ek akshuhinee sena duryodhana ko de di or khud arjuna kaa sarathi bananaa sweekaar kiya
 In this way, the Kauravas collected 11 Akshauhini and the Pandavas collected 7 Akshauhini army
 phir shrikrishna ne karn se milakar use yah samajhaayaa ki vah pandavon kaa hi bhai he atah vah pandavon kii taraf se yuddh kare, parantu karn ne duryodhana ke rin or mitrataa ke kaaran kauravon kaa saath nahin choda
 After this, on requesting Kunti, Karna promised not to kill Arjuna except for the remaining four of his sons when he got the opportunity
 idhar indra ne bhi brahman kaa vesh banaakar karn se uske kavach or kundal le liye
 Due to which the power of Karna was reduced and the enthusiasm of the Pandavas increased because Karna could not be killed by any diva due to that impenetrable armor
 pandavon or kauravon ne apni sena ke kramshah 7 or 11 vibhaag akshuhinee main kiye
 An Akshauhini consists of 21, 870 chariots, 21, 870 elephants, 65, 610 riders and 1,09,350 foot soldiers
 yah pracheen bharat main sena kaa maap hua karata tha
 Each chariot consists of four horses and their charioteer
 Each elephant sits on its elephant, and behind it is its assistant who curbs the elephant from behind the chair, its owner in the chair is fitted with a bow and arrow and with it his two companions There are those who throw spears
 Accordingly the number of people who ride on chariots and elephants are 2, 84, 323
 All the living beings in an Akshohini army - elephants, horses and humans - Mr
 Print 6, 34, 243 happen, so 18 akshauhini total number of all Jivdharion- elephants, horses and men in army-1, will be 14, 16, 374
 atharah akshuhiniyon ke liye yahi sankhya 11, 416 ,374 ho jaati he arthath 3, 93, 660 hathi, 27, 55, 620 ghode, 82, 67, 094 manushya
 Many types of weapons were used in the war of Mahabharata
 praas, rishti, tomars, lohamay kanap, chakra, mudgar, naraach, farse, gofan, bhushundi, shatghni, dhanush-baan, gada, bhaalaa, talwaar, parigh, bhindipal, shakti, musal, kampan, chaap, divyastra, ek saath kai baan chhodane vaali yantric mashine
 Weapons of ancient bronze age kaansya yug kii talwaar 1800 BC iron arrow piece found in excavation in Dadupur village of Lucknow ek saath kai baan chhodane vaali yantric mashine In ancient times, during the time of war, the commander had to make many arrays of army so that the enemy's army could be easily penetrated and the king and the chief generals could be captured or killed
 isamen apni sampoorn sena ko vyuh ke naam yaa gun vaali ek vishesh akruti me vyavasthit kiya jaataa he
 With this type of array of composition, even the smallest army can appear to be huge and can face the largest army as in the battle of Mahabharata, only 7 Akshohini army of Pandavas proved this by facing 11 Akshauhini army of Kaurava
 Shown
 mahabharat ke 18 din ke yuddh main donon paksh ke senapatiyon dwaara kai prakaar ke vyuh banaaye gaye
 Which are as follows- chakravyuuh ke gathan kaa chithran Ancient Shilachitra depicting Abhimanyu entering the Chakra array yuddh kii taiyaariyaan purna karne ke baad kaurav or pandav donon dal kurukshetra pahanche
 The Pandavas made their halt near the banks of Hiranyavati River, far away from the Samantpanchak Tirtha, situated on the southern bank of the Saraswati River in the western region of Kurukshetra, and the Kauravas made a halt in the eastern part of Kurukshetra at a plain level a few miles away
 
 donon pakshon ne vahaan chikne or samtal pradeshon me jahaan ghaas or eendhan kii adhikta thi, apni sena kaa padaav daalaa
 Yudhishthira set up thousands of military camps near the banks of the Hiranyavati River not far from the ashrams of the Devandirs, Tirthas and Maharishi
 vahaan prayek shivi main prachur maatra main khaadya saamagree, astr-shastr, yantra or kai vaidya or shilpi vetan dekar rakhe gayi
 Duryodhana also made thousands of stops in the same way, only the siege of 5 plan was left for war between the two armies
 phir agle din praatah donon paksho kii senaayen ek duusare ke aamane-saamne aakar khadi ho gayin
 The Pandavas put their army stop near the Samantra Panchak Tirtha and the Kauravas made their stop seeing the best and level place
 us sangram main hathi, ghode or rathon kii koi gananaa nahin thi
 On the advice of Pitamah Bhishma, both parties gathered and made some rules of war
 unke banaaye hue niyam nimnlikhit hai- In this way, by making war rules, both parties presented for war
 pandavon ke paas saat akshuhinee sena thi or kauravon ke saath gyaarah akshuhinee sena thi
 The armies of the two sides stood facing east and west
 kauravon kii taraf se bhishma or pandavon kii taraf se arjuna sena kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe the
 Only the armies of both sides were standing in the circle of the area of only 5 plan of Kurukshetra
 yuddh se purv arjuna shrikrishna se apane rath donon senaaon ke madhya main le jane ko kehete hai jisase vah yah dekh le ki yuddh main use kin kin yoddhaon kaa saamana karnaa he
 When Arjun sees his Guru Drona, Pitamah Bhishma and other relatives in the battle field, he becomes very sad and sad
 vah shrikrishna se kahata he ki jinke liye ham ye saare rajbhog praapt karnaa chaahate hai, ve to yahan is yuddh kshetra main usee rajbhog kii prapti ke liye hamaare vipaksh me khadey hai inhen markar ham raaj praapt karke bhi kya karegein
 Therefore, i will not fight, saying that Arjuna sits on the back of the chariot with his bow, then Sri Krishna is situated in yoga and gives him knowledge of the Gita and says that what has come in the world will have to go one day or the other
 yah sharir or sansar donon nashwar hai parantu is sharir ke andar rahane vaala aatma sharir ke marane par bhi nahin marataa
 Just as a person renounces old clothes and wears new clothes, similarly, the soul also abandons the old body and takes on a new body
 Think of it as if all this nature is getting you done, you are just an instrument
 shrikrishna arjuna ko gyaan yoga,bhakthi yoga or karm yoga teenon kii shiksha dete hai jise sunakar arjuna yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he

 Saturn becomes the object of witchcraft, when Saturn gives its momentum in the first house, the first house is the only one, when the darkness starts hiding, the light is recognized and when the position is hidden then the shadow of Saturn Only darkness can be considered
 andhere ke kai rup hote hai, ek andheraa vah hota he jiske kaaran kuch bhi dikhaai nahi detaa he, yah ankhon kaa andheraa mana jaataa he, ek andheraa samajhane kaa bhi hota he, saamne kuch hota he, or samajha kuch jaataa he, ek andheraa buraaiyon kaa hota he, vyakti yaa jeev kii sabhi achchhaaiyaan buraaiyon ke andar chupane kaa kaaran bhi shani kaa diya gaya andheraa hi mana jaataa he, naam kaa andheraa bhe hota he, kisi ko pataa hi nahi hota he, ki koun he or kahaan se aayaa he, koun maan he or koun baap he, aadi ke dwaara kisi bhi rup me chhupav bhi shani ke kaaran hi mana jaataa he, vyakti chaalaaki kaa putala ban jaataa he pratham bhav ke shani ke dwaara
shani apane sthaan se pratham bhav ke andar sthiti rakh kar tisare bhav ko dekhtaa he, teesraa bhav apane se chote bhai bahino kaa bhi hota he, apni andaruni takat kaa bhi hota he, parakram kaa bhi hota he, jo kuch bhi ham dusron se kehete he, kisi bhi saadhan se, kisi bhi tarah se shani ke kaaran apni baat ko sampreshit karne me kathinaayee aati he, jo kaha jaataa he vah saamne vaale ko yaa to samaj me nahi aata he, or aata bhi he to ek bhayanak andheraa hone ke kaaran vah kahi gayi baat ko na samajhane ke kaaran kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, parinaam ke andar fal bhi jo chaiye vah nahi miltaa he, aksar dekha jaataa he ki jiske pratham bhav me shani hota he, uskaa jivan saathi jor jor se bolnaa chaalu kar detaa he, uskaa kaaran uske dwaara jor jor se bolne kii aadat nahi, pratham bhav kaa shani sunne ke andar kami kar detaa he, or saamne vaale ko jor se bolne par hi yaa to sunaayi detaa he, yaa vah kuch kaa kuch samaj letaa he, isi liye jivan saathi ke saath kuch sunne or kuch samajhane ke kaaran maansik naa samajhi kaa parinaam sambandhon me kaduvaahat ghul jaati he, or sambandh tut jate hai
 From its first house, the tenth eye directly looks at the spirit of karma, this is also the spirit of karma
 jataka ko karm karne or karm ko samajhane me kaafii kathinaayee kaa saamana karnaa pasta he, jab kisi prakaar se karm ko nahi samajha jaataa he to jo bhi kiya jaataa he vah karm na hokar ek bhaar swaroop hi samajha jaataa he, yahi baat pita ke prati maan lee jaati he,pita ke prati shani apni sift ke anusaar andhera detaa he, or us andhere ke kaaran pita ne putr ke prati kya kiya he, samaj nahi hone ke kaaran pita putr main anban bhi bani rahati he,putr kaa lagan yaa pratham bhav kaa shani mata ke chauthe bhav me chalaa jaataa he, or mata ko jo kaam nahi karne chaiye ve usko karne passage hai, kathin or ek seemaa me rahakar mata ke dwaara kaam karne ke kaaran uskaa jivan ek ghere main bandhaa sa rah jaataa he, or vah apni shariri sift ko us prakaar se prayog nahi kar paati he jis prakaar se ek saadhaaran aadmi apni jindagi ko jeena chahta he
 The second house is the sense of material wealth, by physical wealth means, rupee, money, gold, silver, diamond, pearl, jewelry, etc
 When Shani Dev is in the second house, he also keeps his dark towards his family members, Only by getting family members to fight, quarrel etc
, they distance themselves from their own family, in the matter of money, it is not known how much came and how much was spent, how much did it come from, the second feeling is the sense of speaking, whatever It is talked about, He does not know what has been said, can also be abusive and cold talk also, cold talk means negative thing, be asked to do any thing, nor should it come out in the north
 Also, the fourth house is also related to the mother, house, and vehicle, the fourth house is also known for its pleasures, in the second Saturn, nothing is seen except the traveling work and sleeping in the house
 doosraa shani sidhe rup me aathven bhav ko dekhtaa he, aathva bhav shamshani takaton kii taraf rujhaan badhaa detaa he, vyakti bhoot,pret,jinn or pishachi shaktiyon ko apnaane main apana man laga detaa he, shamshani sadhana ke kaaran uskaa khan paan bhi shamshani ho jaataa he,sharaab,kebab or bhoot ke bhojan main uski ruchi batch jaati he
 Second Saturn also sees the eleventh house, the eleventh house darkens its faith towards immovable property, darkens the mind towards friends and elder brothers and sisters
 ve kuch karnaa chaahate hai lekin vyakti ke dimag main kuch or hi samaj me aata he
 The third sense is of might, of the courage and courage of the person, wherever the person lives, of his neighbors
 in sabake kaarnon ke andar tisare bhav se shani pancham bhav ko bhi dekhtaa he, jiname shiksha,santan or turat aane vaale dhano ko bhi janaa jaataa he, mitron kii sahabhaagita or bhabhi kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa bhav mana jaataa he, pita kii mrityu kaa or dada ke bade bhai kaa bhav bhi paanchavaa he
 Apart from this, the third Shani also hurts the ninth house, in which knowledge of religion, social behavior, old customs and family practice etc
 is also hurt
 makaan or aaraam karne vaale sthano ke prati yah shani apni andhere vaali niti ko pratipaadit karata he
 This Saturn tortures Nanihal family
 chauthe bhav kaa mukhya prabhaav vyakti ke liye kaafii ksht dene vaala hota he, mata, man, makaan, or pani vaale saadhan, tathaa sharir kaa pani is shani ke prabhaav se gandala jaataa he, aaajeevan kshtdhene vaala hone se puraano me is shani vaale vyakti kaa jivan nark may hi bataaya jaataa he
 If this Saturn is of Libra, Capricorn, Aquarius or Pisces, then there is some reduction in sufferings in its fruit
 is bhav me shani ke hone ke kaaran vyakti ko mantra vetta bana detaa he, vah kitne hi good mantron ke dwaara logo kaa bhala karne vaala to ban jaataa he, lekin apane liye jivan saathi ke prati,jaaydaad ke prati, or nagad dhan ke saath jamaa puunji ke liye dukh hi uthaaya karata he
 Due to the presence of Saturn in the child and being cold, there is a delay in the child, there is a lot of female child, due to the loss of life with a partner, he remains more indifferent to his life
 is bhav me shani kitne hi daihik daivik or bhautik rogon kaa daata ban jaataa he, lekin is bhav kaa shani paariwarik shatruta ko samaapt kar detaa he,mamaa khandaan ko samaapt karne vaala hota he,chachaa khandan se kabhi banati nahi he
 If a person keeps on doing the work done in some way, then he is successful, if somehow he does the work of the owner then he fails
 apni teesri najar se aathven bhav ko dekhne ke kaaran se vyakti dur drishti se kisi bhi kaam yaa samasya ko nahi samaj paata he, kaaryon se kisi na kisi prakaar se apane prati jokhim ko nahi samaj paane se jo bhi kamata he, yaa jo bhi kiya jaataa he, uske prati andheraa hi rahata he, or aksmaat samasya aane se pareshaan hokar jo bhi paas me hota he ganvaa detaa he
 Due to the darkness in the twelfth house, there is also ignorance of the external calamities, for whatever reason they become external, they are either duped by them or they find themselves hurt due to Saturn's tricks of outsiders
 khud ke chote bhai bahin kya kar rahe hai or unki kaary pranali khud ke prati kya he uske prati anjaan rahata he
 Often, when this sign of Saturn comes, it gives way to disorientation, and often such people forget even in the known place
 saatvaan bhav patni or mantranaa karne vaale logo se apana sambandh rakhata he
 Due to the darkness of life partner and the persistence of negative thoughts in the mind, the person always considers himself to be a childless in everything, the life partner starts to get away from the native with a little bit of time only after being denied as a negation, If the native could not make positive thoughts towards himself, then in most cases the householders have been seen to be ruined, and the result of two marriages is due to the seventh Saturn
 He has been seen to be found, seventh Saturn remains indifferent to the old customs and towards his ancestors, only because of thinking about himself and i cannot do anything, due to the continuation of his old dignity
 It is often forgotten, because of the status of work and non-functioning in father and son, there is a rift
 vyakti apane rahane vaale sthaan par apane kaaran banaakar ashaanti utpann karata rahata he, apni mata yaa mata jaisi mahila ke man me virodh bhi paidaa karata rahata he, use lagata he ki jo bhe uske prati kiya ja rahaa he, vah galat hi kiya ja rahaa he or isi kaaran se vah apane hi logon se virodh paidaa karne me nahi hichakataa he
 Due to the effect of this Saturn on the body's water, the mind's thoughts get dirty, the person gets the diseases of the stomach and the reproductive organs in his body, and the diseases of the female child, etc
 due to this Saturn
 is bhav kaa shani khaane pine or mouj masti karne ke chakkar main jeb hameshaa khaali rakhata he
 Because of not knowing which work to do, the rise of vagabond in the person has been seen, Saturn of the higher gives ability to supernatural knowledge, even secret knowledge is also a factor of Saturn
 navaan bhav bhagya kaa mana gaya he, is bhav main shani hone ke kaaran se kathin or dukh daayi yatraayen karne ko milti hai, lagaataar gum kar cells aadi ke kaamo me kaafii pareshaani kerani padati he, agar yah bhav sahi hota he, to vyakti mazaakia hota he, or har baat ko chutkulon ke dwaara kaha karata he, magar jab is bhav me shani hota he to vyakti syrius ho jaataa he, or ekaant main apane ko rakhane apni bhalaai sochataa he, nawein bhav baale shani ke ke kaaran vyakti apni pahichaan ekaant vaasa jhagadaa na jhansa vaali kahawat se purna rakhata he
 Cultivating works, house-building works, works for property related work
 agar koi acha grah is shani par apni najar rakhata he to vyakti jaj vaale kaamo kii taraf or court kachhari vaale kaamon kii taraf apana rujhaan rakhata he
 Doctors of animals and also teach animals, most of the ninth Saturn people love to raise animals
 kitabon ko chhapakar bechney vaale bhi nawein shani se kahi na kahi jude hote hai
 Tenth Saturn takes the mind towards hard work, whatever are the hard work, wood, stone, iron etc
 They all come in the area of saturn tenth, the person creates a field towards work in his life and that area Does not want to leave rahu kaa asar hone se yaa kisi bhi prakaar se mangal kaa prabhaav ban jane se is prakaar kaa vyakti yatayaat kaa sipaahi ban jaataa he, use jindagi ke kitne hi kaam or kitne hi logon ko baari baari se paas karnaa pasta he, dasven shani vaale kii najar bahut hi tej hoti he vah kisi bhi rakhi cheez ko nahi bhuulataa he, mehnat kii kamakar khaanaa jaanata he, apane rahane ke liye jab bhi makaan aadi banaata he to keval strecchar hi banaakar khada kar paata he, uske rahane ke liye kabhi bhi badhia aaleeshaan makaan nahi ban paata he
 If the Guru is working properly, then the person becomes the one who works on the post of Executive Engineer
 shani dawaaiyon kaa kaarak bhi he, or is ghar me jataka ko scientist bhi bana detaa he, agar jaraa si bhi budh saath detaa ho to vyakti ganit ke farmule or nai khoj karne me maahir ho jaataa he
 It takes mind to do charity work, is adept at erecting and rebuilding the structure of the house, a person has two houses in his life
