 Template: University of Andhra Pradesh vidhik pratyakshvaad vidhi evam vidhishastra ke darshan se sambandhit ek vichaardhaara he
 It was developed mostly by the thinkers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, among whom Jeremy Bentham and John Austin are prominent
 kintu vidhik pratyakshvaad ke itihaas main sabase ullekhneey naam ech el e heart kaa he jinaki 'da cocept of lau' naamak pustak ne is vishay main gaharaai se vichaar karne ko majaboor kar diya
 In recent years, Ronald Dorkin has raised serious questions on some central ideas of legal positivism
 vidhik pratyakshvaad ko saar rup main kahana kathin he kintu praayah mana jaataa he ki vidhik pratyakshvaad kaa kendriya vichaar yah he: Analytical thinking was mainly initiated by Bentham towards the end of the eighteenth century, which was later developed by Austin
 ise pramanvadi vichaardhaara bhi kaha jaataa he
 Samand calls it systematic jurisprudence and CK Allen normative doctrine
 is vichaardhaara kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki jis prakaar bhautik-vigyaan vishleshan ke bal par aage badhata he thik usee prakaar yah kisi cheez ko bina vishleshan ke yathaavat sweekaar nahin kar leti
 Like the natural ideology, it does not consider the method to be divine or divine or received, rather it originates from the sovereign state
 yah vichaardhaara vidhik niyamon kaa vishleshan karti he
 Therefore, it is different from historical or sociological ideology
 yah vichaardhaara naagarik vidhi tathaa anya vidhiyon ke parsparik sambandhon kaa adhyayan vishleshnatmak dhang se karnaa chaahati he tathaa vidhi ko praapt nahin apitu nirmit maanati he
 This ideology has no meaning in what is the origin of the method's historical progress
 julius stone ne thik hi kaha he ‘‘isaki pramukh dilchaspee vidhik bhavarthon ke vishleshan or vidhik tark vaakyon ke taarkik antah sambandhon ke bare main khojbin karnaa he
 Samand has expressed the purpose of this ideology in these words- munro smith ke anusaar yah vichaardhaara rajya kii sachetan muhar vidhi ke liye aavashyak maanati he
 In this sense method is the expression of conscious and fixed human desire
 pramanwad ek vaigyanik drushtikon pradaan karata he jisase anubhav se pare pariklpanaaon ko asweekaar kar aankadon dwaara prastut anubhav tak hi simit rahaa ja sake
 This approach is limited to the analysis of the given facts and does not go away from the phenomena of cognition
 ateet tathaa bhavishya kii pariklpanaaon se dur rahakar ‘vidhi jaisi he’ ke tathyaatmak adhyayan ke kaaran ise pramanvadi drushtikon naam diya gaya he
 Being mainly prevalent in England and associated with Austin, it is also called English or Austenian school
 ise vidhi ko samprabhu kaa samadesh maanane or use maane jane kii baadhyataa ke kaaran aagyaatmak siddhanth bhi kaha jaataa he
 Hart considers it to be "the command, discipline and the Triveni of Samprabhu"
 is vichaardhaara main manushya dwaara vidhi ke nirmaanatmak tatwon par vishesh bal diya jaataa he
 At the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, this ideology was born for the following reasons
 1
 atharahavin shatabdi prakritik vidhi vichaarkon kii thi jisamen vidhik darshan par niti, vivek tathaa nyaay ke siddhanth haaavee the
 This was the era of 'method as it should be'
 parantu yah bahut samay tak sangat nahin rahaa
 Bentham distanced himself from this type of ideology and emphasized on explanatory jurisprudence i
e
 'law which is'
 taatpary he ki vishleshnatmak vichaardhaara kaa janm prakritik vidhi vichaardhaara ke virodh swaroop hua
 2
 The progress made in physics in the early nineteenth century certainly had an impact on the principles of legal science as well
 vidhi ke adhyayan ke liye sakshya, tark, pareekshan tathaa die gayi tathyon ke vishleshan ke tareekon ko apanaaya gaya
 Scientific, systematic empirical or empirical method was adopted to study the method
 3
 aisa prathit hota he ki vishleshanvaadi vichaardhaara ke dwaara england main saamanton tathaa pope aadi par samprabhu shaasha kii shreshthata siddh kii gai
 With this ideology, spiritual interference in the field of law decreased
 vidhik pramanwad ko rajya samprabhu ke rup main tathaa vidhi ko samprabhu ke samadesh ke rup main or vidhi ke anupaalan main anushaasti ke tatv kii vyakhya ke kaaran vidhi kaa aagyaatmak siddhanth bhi kaha gaya he
 Legalism has been used in various ways
 aadhunik vishleshnatmak pramanvadi vichaarak pro echele heart ne swayan iskaa prayog paanch arthon main sweekaar kiya he
 In explaining the actual background of the experiment conducted in these five sense, Hart makes it clear that the principles from Bentham and Austin follow but do not follow the other principles
 isi tarah kelson ne, or main vyakt siddhanton ko mana he parantu or main diye gayi siddhanton ko nahin
 According to Hart, none of the theories described in Bentham, Austin, and Kelsen have been accepted
 phir bhi yah siddhanth pratyakshtah bina paryaapt kaarnon ke vishleshnatmak vidhishastriyon ke saath aksar jod diya jaataa he
 Yogavasistha is the most important text of Advaita Vedanta in Sanskrit literature
 isamen rishi vasishtha bhagwaan ram ko nirgun brahm kaa gyaan dete hai
 According to Adikavi Valmiki tradition, the author of Yogavasishtha is considered
 mahabharat ke baad sanskrit kaa yah doosraa sabase bada granth he
 It is also an important book of yoga
 'maharamayana', 'yogavasishth-ramayana', 'aarsh ramayana', 'vaasishth-ramayana' tathaa 'gyanavasishth' aadi naamon se bhi ise janaa jaataa he
 The Yogavasistha has a representation of the inclinations of the world and the Paramatmatta through various parables
 yogavasishth ke tritiy prakaran kaa naam utpatti prakaran, chaturth kaa naam sthiti prakaran tathaa pancham kaa naam upsham prakaran he
 On this basis, it seems that this case is an interpretation of the letters A, u and m of Onkar
 vidvatjanon kaa mat he ki sukh or dukh, jaraa or mrityu, jivan or jagat, jad or chetan, lok or paralok, bandhan or moksh, brahm or jeev, aatma or paramatma, atmagyaan or agyaan, sat or asat, man or indriyaan, dharna or vaasana aadi vishyon par kadachit hi koi granth ho jisamen ‘yoga vaasishth’ kii apeksha adhik gambhir chintan tathaa sookshm vishleshan hua ho
 The importance of this book is further enhanced by the combination of countless fascinating stories along with the experiences of many sages and sages
 moksh praapt karne kaa ek hi maarg he aatmanusndhan
 a unique description of the activities of many saints and great men engaged in Atmanusandhan is given in this book
 yogavasishth main jag kii asatta or parmatmasatta kaa vibhinn drushtaanton ke madhyam se pratipaadan he
 Along with the representation of the effort and knowledge of the elements, it also has a subtle discussion on scriptural virtue, renunciation, ritualism and ideal behavior etc
 isamen baudhon ke vigyaanvaadee, shoonyavaadee, madhyamik ityadi maton kaa tathaa kashmiri shaiva, trik, pratybhigna tathaa spand ityadi tatvagyanon kaa nirdesh hone ke kaaran iske rachayita usee naam ke anya kavi maane jate hai
 Hence there is a difference of opinion regarding the actual author of this book
 yah granth arshramayana, maharamayana, vasishtharamayana, gyanavasishth or keval vaasishth ke naam se bhi prasiddh he
 Verse number of Yogavasistha is 32 thousand
 vidwaanon ke matanusaar mahabharat ke samaan iskaa bhi teen avasthaaon main vikaas hua— The Yogavasistha text is complete in six episodes
 isamen shlokon kii kul sankhya 27687 he
 Its 'maharamayana' designation is very meaningful due to the fact that there are about four thousand more verses than Valmiki Ramayana
 isamen ramachandraji kii jeevani na hokar maharishi vasishtha dwaara die gaye aadhyatmik upadesh hai
 In the first Vairagya episode, after the Upanayana rites, Lord Ramchandra went to study with his brothers in Gurukul
 adhyayan samaapti ke baad tirthayatra se waapas lautne par ramachandraji virakt hue
 In Maharaja Dasaratha's assembly he says what is the use of splendor, state, body and aspiration
 kuch hi dinon main kaal in sab kaa naash karne vaala he
 He prayed to his mentor Vasishtha and Vishwamitra to get rid of his mood
 duusare mumukshuvyavhaar prakaran main vishwamitra kii soochna ke anusaar vashishtha rishi ne upadesh diya he
 In the 3-4 and 5th episodes the origin, position and origin of the world are chronicled
 in prakaaranon main anek drushtaantatmak aakhyaan or upaakhyaan nivedan kiye gaye hai
 The sixth episode is divided in the first half and the latter
 isamen sansarchakr main phase hue jeevatma ko nirvana arthath niratishay anand kii prapti kaa upaay pratipaadit kiya gaya he
 In this great book, interestingness has reduced due to the repetition of subjects and ideas

 Vibhava means reason
 ye sthaayee bhaavon kaa vibhaavan / udbodhan karte hai, unhen aswaad yogya banaate hai
 These are considered fundamental in the origin of juice
 vibhaav ke do bhed hai: The main emotion or object due to which the emotion originates is called poetic reception
 alamban ke antargat aate hai vishay or aashray

 Satvik
 aashray kii sharir sambandhi cheshtaaen angik yaa kayik anubhav he
 Earthly deflection, sarcasm etc
 are the rhetorical rhetorical experiences when the Rati Bhava is awake
 aropit yaa kritrim vesh-rachana aharya anubhav he
 But, in the wake of permanent feeling, natural, unnatural, ayatnaj, angvikar are called satvik experiences
 iske liye aashray ko koi bahya cheshtaa nahin kerani padati
 Hence they are called Ayatnaj
 ye swat: pradurbhoot hote hai or inhen roka nahin ja saktaa
 Satvik Anubhav: meaning there are eight distinctions - pillar, Sveda, thrill, Swarbhang, Vepathu, Vaivarnya, Tear and Pralaya
 jo bhav keval thodi der ke liye sthaayee bhav ko pusht karne ke nimitt sahaayak rup main aate hai or turant lupt ho jate hai, ve sanchari bhav hai

 Sringar's permanent rite, humor humor, raudra's wrath, Karun's grief, valor's excitement, wonder of wonder, jugupsa of beauty, fear of terrible and permanent sham of calm or nirvade
 bharat ne aath rason ke devtaa kramash: vishnu, pramath, rudra, yamraj, indra, brahma, mahakaal tathaa kaldev ko mana he
 Narayana, the god of quiet juice, and his character Kundetu are said to be
 pratham aath rason ke kramash: shyaam, sit, rakt, kapot, gaur, pit, nil tathaa krishna varna maane gaye hai

 shringaar kii anukriti se hasya, raudra tathaa vir karm ke parinamswaroop karun tathaa adbhut evam vibhats darshan se bhayanak utpann hota he
 Anukriti means Abhinavagupta's words, so the feel of any juice can be productive of humor
 vikrut veshalankaradi bhi hasyotpadak hote hai
 The work of Rādra is destruction, hence the doer of Karun and the performer of heroic work are often seen doing unpardonable actions, so it seems natural to originate from him
 isi prakaar bibhatsadarshan se bhayanak kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 Smashanadi's philosophy alone is frightening
 tathaapi yah utpatti siddhant atyantik nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki parapaksh kaa raudra yaa vir ras swapaksh ke liye bhayanak kii sristi bhi kar saktaa he or bibhatsadarshan se shant kii utpatti bhi sambhav he
 The origin of Karun is also possible from Raudra, terrible, Shringar, wonderful and heroic and terrible
 vastut: bharat kaa abhimath spasht nahin he
 After him, Dhananjaya considered the four stages of the mind as growth, expansion, disturbance and deflection, adornment and humor as growth, heroic and wonderful as expansion, disturbing and terrible as distraction and raudra and Karun related to deflection
 kintu jo vidvan keval druti, vistaar tathaa vikaas naamak teen hi avasthaaen maanate hai unka is vargeekaran se samaadhaan na hoga
 Similarly, if we consider the fluid state of the mind in Shringar, its expansion in humor and the wonderful, its brilliance in Veer and Raudra, and its hesitation in the horrors and the terrible, then even Bharata's order is not right
 ek sthiti ke saath duusari sthiti kii upasthiti bhi asambhav nahin he
 Deepti and Karun have both druti and hesitation in detail with the wonderful and heroic
 phir bhi bharatkrut sambandh sthaapan se itnaa sanket avashya miltaa he ki kathith rason main paraspar upakaarkarta vidyaman he or ve ek duusare ke mitra tathaa sahachaari hai
 Like friendship, the opposition of these juices has also been imagined according to the situation
 kis rasvishesh ke saath kin anya rason kaa turant varnan aswaad main baadhak hoga, yah virombhavna isi vichaar par aadhaarit he
 Of Shringar from Karun, Bibhatsa, Raudra, Veer and Bhavya; Horrible and compassionate to comic; Karun with humor and adornment; Of humor, adornment and terrible of raudra; Shringar, Veer, Raudra, of humor and the terrible of calm; From the terrifying and serene to the heroic; Veer, adornment, raudra, humor and gruesome calm are considered opposites
 yah virodh aashray aikya, alamban aikya athwa nairantary ke kaaran upasthit hota he
 There is a possibility of this opposition in the management poetry itself
 muktak main prasang kii chand ke saath hi samaapti ho jane se iskaa bhay nahin rahata he
 The writer should avoid the presence of anti-rasam from the presence of the antagonistic juices and the alarms separately or by presenting the friendly juice of the two between the two opposing rasas or by presenting the amaranth of angras rather than the principal rasa
 
 ras kii aswadaniyata kaa vichaar karte hue use brahmanand sahodar, swaprakashanand, vilakshan aadi bataaya jaataa he or is aadhaar par sabhi rason ko anandatmak mana gaya he
 Bhattnayak has indicated the beauty of all the juices by showing mritva-paratva-inferior condition due to Sattvodrak, Abhinavagupta, Nirvigna's realization and Anandavardhan stating the state of melody and humidity in Karuna as Shringar, Vipralambha and Karuna progressively flourishing
 kintu anukoolvedaniyata tathaa pratikulvedaniyata ke aadhaar par bhaavon kaa vivechan karke rudrabhatt ramchandra gunachandra, haripal, tathaa dhananjay ne or hindi main acharya ramchandra shukla ne rason kaa sukhaatmak tathaa du:khaatmak anubhuthavaala mana he
 Abhinavagupta had first introduced the theory of "sukhu: Khasbhavono Ras:" in "abhinavabharati"
 sukhaatmak rason main shringaar, vir, hasya, adbhut tathaa shant kii or du:khaatmak main karun, raudra, bibhats tathaa bhayanak kii gananaa kii gai
 By giving the example of "pancaras", it has been proved that in the Panc juice made by mixing jaggery, Mirich etc
, there is a peculiar kind of taste, not knowing the sour sweetness of different items, it is also said that that picture In the same way, in a proportionate way, sometimes sour, sometimes hard, and so on, the taste of other types comes
 madhusudan saraswati kaa kathan he ki raj athwa tam kii apeksha satv ko pradhan maan lene par bhi yah to maananaa hi chahie ki anshat: unka bhi aswaad bana rahata he
 Acharya Shukla is of the opinion that the feeling we have is of the described sense and the expressions are of a dry, sadistic nature, etc
 Therefore, the rasa will also be of both types
 duusari ore rason ko anandatmak maanane ke pakshpaati sahrudayon ko hi iskaa praman maanate hai or tark kaa sahaara lete hai ki du:khadaayi vastu bhi yadi apni priy he to sukhadaayi hi prathit hoti he
 For example, at the time of the night, a woman feels pain in her body, but at that time she considers it a pleasure
 bhoj tathaa vishwanath kii is dharna ke atirikt swayan madhusudan saraswati rason ko loukik bhaavon kii anubhuti se bhinn or vilakshan maanakar inaki anandatmakataa kaa samarthan karte he or abhinavgupt vitvighnaprathit vatakar is dharna ko spasht karte hai ki usee bhav kaa anubhav bhi yadi bina vichlit hue or kisi bahari athwa antarodbhoot antaraay ke bina kiya jaataa he to vah sahya hone ke kaaran anandatmak hi kehalaata he
 If you consider it to be sorrowful, then consider the distinction of adornment as sad as well, then why should the distinction of adornment be considered sorrowful? By giving many such arguments, the conformity of the juices is proved
 angreji main tragedy se milanevaale anand kaa bhi anek prakaar se samaadhaan kiya gaya he or marathi lekhakon ne bhi rason kii aanandarupata ke sambandh main paryaapt bhinn dharanaayen prastut kii hai
 Often, the notion of considering Ras as the same in the traditional form has been prevalent, considering the different names of the juices as official or formal authority
 bharat ne "na hi rasaadrute kashchidpyarth : pravartat" pankti main "ras" shabd kaa ek vachan main prayog kiya he or abhinavgupt ne uparilikhit dharna vyakt kii he
 Bhoja has treated Shringar as the only juice and has always interpreted it differently, according to Vishwanath, Narayan Pandit considers the miraculous miracle to be the only juice, because miracle is the form
 bhawabhooti ne karun ko hi ekmaatr ras maanakar usee se sabaki utpatti bataai he or bharat ke "swan swan nimittamasadya shantadbhav: pravartate, punarnimittapaye c shant evopaliyate" - vaktavy ke aadhaar par shant ko hi ekmaatr ras mana ja saktaa he
 Similarly, on the basis of the server-friendly state of excitement and amazement, they can also be considered at the root of all other juices
 ras aswaad or anand ke rup main ek akhand anubhuti maatr hai, yah ek paksh he or ek hi ras se anya rason kaa udbhav hua he yah doosraa paksh he
 In the idea of rasapradhanya, the problem of rajrajata has arisen
 bharat samast shuchi, ujwal, medhya or dalneey ko shringaar maanate hai, "agnipurana" shringaar ko hi ekmaatr ras bataakar anya sabko usee ke bhed maanata he, bhoj shringaar ko hi mul or ekmaatr ras maanate hai, parantu uplabdh likhit pramaan ke aadhaar par "rasraj" shabd kaa prayog "ujjvalaneelamani" main bhakthiras ke liye hi dikhaai detaa he
 In Hindi, Keshavdas considers Shringar to be the origin of all Rasas and Rasavayak Dev
 "rasraj" sangya kaa shringaar ke liye prayog matiram dwaara hi kiya gaya miltaa he
 On the other hand, Banarasidas declares "navamo Sant Rasani Ko Nayak" in the play "samayasara"
 rasarajata kii sweekruti vyapaktaa, utkar aswadyata, anya rason ko antarbhoot karne kii kshamta sabhi sanchaariyon tathaa saatvikon ko ant:saat karne kii shakti sarvapranisulabhtv tathaa shighragrahyata aadi par nirbhar he
 All these things are found in as much and strong makeup, not in other juices
 at: rasraj vahi kehalaata he
 Raso's king Shringar Ras is considered vichaarco ne raudra tathaa karun ko chhodkar shesh rason kaa bhi varnan kiya he
 The most detailed description of these is that of dressing
 shringaar mukhyat: sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he, kintu dhananjay aadi kuch vidvan vipralambh ke purvanurag bhed ko sanyog-vipralambh-virahit purvavastha maanakar ayog kii sangya dete hai tathaa shesh viprayog tathaa sambhog naam se do bhed or karte hai
 On the basis of many circumstances of coincidence, it is considered to be invisible and it is distinguished only by the idea of asylum, heroic or amphibious, disguised with the idea of publication and light or clear and secret and secret and narrow, narrow, prosperous and prosperous with the idea of publication type and The antecedents or aspirations of Vipralambha, Maan or Ishratheetuk, Migration, Viraha and Karun Pralambha were distinguished
 Huh
 "kavyprakash" kaa virahahetuk nayaa he or shaapahetuk bhed pravaas ke hi antargat gruhit ho saktaa he, "sahityadarpan" main karun vipralambh kii kalpana kii gai he
 From the point of view of antecedent reason, on the basis of virtue and brightness, brightness, eye-sighting, imagery, dream and indraja-darshana-jagya and raga are divided into blue, kusumbha and manjistha
 "alankarikoustubh" main sheeghra nasht honevaale tathaa shobhit na honevaale raag ko "haridr" naam se chauthaa bataaya he, jise unka tikaakar "shyamaraag" bhi kahata he
 The predicaments of the predecessor - Abhilasha, Anxiety, Reminiscence, Gunakirtana, Udveg, Lament, Vyadhi, Inertia and Death - have been considered, in whose place Vishnu Dharmadartyapurana as the opinion of himself and elsewhere, the commentary of the tentacular, the epithet, the greatness
 And with a slight change in Saraswati Kantharan and poetry, Chakshupriti, mind, remembrance, sleeplessness, tanuta, vocation, shame, mania, Uchrchha and has been mentioned death
 shaardatnay ne ichha tathaa uthkanthaa ko jodakar tathaa vidyanath ne samaran ke sthaan par sankalp laakar or pralaap tathaa sanjvar ko badhaakar inaki sankhya 12 maani he
 It is not rational and can have an inbreeding effect
 maan-vipralambh pranay tathaa ishrya ke vichaar se do prakaar kaa tathaa maan kii sthirataa tathaa aparaadh kii gambhirtha ke vichaar se laghu, madhyam tathaa guru naam se teen prakaar kaa, pravasvipralambh kaaryaj, shaapaj, sanbhramaj naam se teen prakaar kaa or kaaryaj ke yasyatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhavishyat gachchhatpravas yaa vartmaan tathaa gatpravas yaa bhootpravas, shaapaj ke tadrupya tathaa vairupy, tathaa sambhramaj ke utpaat, vaat, divya, maanush tathaa parachakradi bhed ke kaaran kai prakaar kaa hota he
 Due to the closeness of Virah Gurujnadi, even after being close, the disconnection of the heroine and the hero coinciding and Karun Vipralambha is the hope of union by resurrection even after death
 shringaar ras ke antargat nayikalankar, ritu tathaa prakruti kaa bhi varnan kiya jaataa he
 An example is- isi prakaar sanyog tathaa vipralambh yaa viyog ke naam se do bhaagon main vibhajit shringaar ras kaa udhaaharan- Distinguishing the self, lust, dislocated, subjugated, hijacked and overbearing from the potentiality of humor and the development of humor and development of humor, making three distinctions from their superior, medium and unholy nature, the two aforesaid distinctions were placed respectively
 has gone
 hindi main keshavadas tathaa ekaadh anya lekhak ne keval mandahas, kalhas, atihaas tathaa parihaas naamak chaar hi bhed kiye hai
 Many other names of humor based on English have also become popular
 udhaaharan - New example- shant kaa koi bhed nahin he
 Only Rudrabhatta has definitely given four distinctions under the names Vairagya, Doshanigraha, Santhosh and Tattvakshakshpatakara which are mere names and their number can be increased
 udhaaharan - In the eight dramas propounded in Bharatamuni's 'natyashastra', the difference between adornment and humor and Karun Rasa was calculated before Rudra
 ‘raudratu karuno ras:’ kahkar 'karun ras' kii utpatti 'raudra ras' se maani gai he or uski utpatti shaapjanya klesh vinipat, ishtjan-viprayog, vibhav naash, vadh, bandhan, vidrav arthath palaayan, apaghaat, vyasan arthath aapatti aadi vibhaavon ke sanyog se sweekaar kii he
 Also nirved, guilt, worry, adulation, impulse, fascination, labor, fear, sadness, pity, sickness, inertia, hysteria, epiphany, tragedy, laziness, death, stanza, vapathu, vevarnya, teardrop, swearing etc
 Calculated as an expression
 udhaaharan - In poetic juices, there is an important place for raudra rasa
 bharat ne ‘naatyashaastra’ main shringaar, raudra, vir tathaa vibhats, in chaar rason ko hi pradhan mana he, at: inhen se anya rason kii utpatti bataayi he, yatha-‘teshamutpattihetavakshatvaaro rasa: shringaaro rodro vero vibhats iti’
 Describing the origin of Karun Rasa from Raudra, Bharata says that 'raudrasyaiv ch yatkam sa shey: Karuno rasa:'
 raudra ras kaa karm hi karun ras kaa janak hota he
 The 'permanent emotion' of the raudra rasa is 'anger' and its character is blood and the deity Rudra
 keshavadas kii ‘ramachandrika’ se raudra ras kaa udhaaharan pehle hi ankit kiya ja chukaa he
 Examples of raudra rasa are also found in Bhushan's compositions
 vartmaan kaal main shyaamanarayan pandeya tathaa ‘dinakar’ kii rachanaaon main raudra ras kii prabhavakaari vyanjana hui he
 In the Sanskrit texts, 'mahabharata' and 'veeracharit', 'venichabhika' etc
 plays have had a powerful expression of the raudra rasa
 udhaaharan - Along with Shringar, Raudra and Vibhats, Veeraras is also enumerated by Bharata Muni in the original rasas
 vir ras se hi adbhut ras kii utpatti batalaai gai he
 The 'varna' of Veer Ras is called 'swarna' or 'gaur' and the god Indra
 yah uttam prakruti waalo se sambaddh he tathaa iskaa sthaayee bhav ‘utsaah’ he
 Only Yudveer, Dharmaveer, Dayavir and Danveer distinction of Veer Ras are accepted
 utsaah ko aadhaar maanakar panditraj aadi ne anya anek bhed bhi kiye hai
 Examples - adbhut ras ke bharatmuni ne do bhed ie hai- divya tathaa anandaj 
 The Vaishnava Acharya makes a distinction called vision, श्रrut, Sankrit and Anumit
 bibhats bharat tathaa dhananjay ke anusaar shuddh, kshobhan tathaa udayegi naam se teen prakaar kaa hota he
 Three types are considered to be derogatory or illusory, criminological or imaginary, and three types of dissonant or real name, and two types of self-directed distinction from terrible causation
 sthayibhaavon ke kisi vishesh lakshan athwa rason ke kisi bhav kii samanta ke aadhaar par praaia: rason kaa ek duusare main antarbhaav karne, kisi sthayibhav kaa tiraskaar karke naveen sthaayee maanane kii pravriti bhi yada-kada dikhaai padi he
 As such, among Shanta Rasa and Dayavir and Vibhats, Dayavir's intrusion into calm and unhappy permanent Jugupsa is considered permanent
 "naganand" naatak ko koi shant kaa or koi dayavir ras kaa naatak maanata he
 But if the metaphysical pause of calm and compassionate zeal of Dayavir is noted, then there will be a difference between the two
 isi prakaar jugupsa main jo vikarshan he vah shant main nahin rahata
 Quiet ragas-malice is both inclusiveness and metaphysics, in which jugupsa can become communicable
 thik aise jaise karun main bhi sahanubhuti kaa sanchaar rahata he or dayavir main bhi, kintu karun main shok kii sthiti he or dayavir main sahanubhuthaprerit aatmashaktisambhoot aanandarup utsaah kii
 Or, just as both Raudra and Yudhveer have an enemy, so both have the amount of anger, but the rapture in Prahodratikul acuteness and indiscretion, and Yudhveer have a ferocity and prudence
 krodh main shatruvinaash main pratishodh kii bhaavana rahati he or vir main dhairya or udaartaa
 Therefore, their mutual interaction is not possible
 isi prakaar "anmarsh" ko vir kaa sthaayee maananaa bhi uchit nahin, kyonki amarsh ninda, apmaan yaa akshepadi ke kaaran chitt ke abhinivesh yaa swabhimanavbodh ke rup main prakat hota he, kintu viraras ke dayavir, daanveer, tathaa dharmaveer naamak bhedon main is prakaar kii bhaavana nahin rahati
 He was a Pakistani politician and former acting Chief Minister of Pakistan's province of Balochistan
 jain darshan ke anusaar, asrav sansar kaa ek tatva athwa ek mul yatharth hai
 It refers to the effect of mind and body behind the doing of the soul
 jain dharm main, karm kii prakriya saat satya yaa moulik siddhanton par aadhaarit hai, jo maanav durdasha samajhaate hai
 Out of those seven, four - Ashrava, Bandha, Samvar and Nirjara - are associated with the process of karma
 bhartiya darshan kii duusari paramparaon main bhi aatma ko malin karanevaale tatv ashrav ke naam se abhihit kiye gaye hai
 Despite the difference in the extent of their appearance, there is a similarity that the ashrava is the stool of the mind which needs to be disposed of
 jain granth tattwarthsutra ke anusaar "yoga se ashram hota he
 " man, vachan or kaaya kii sahaayta se atmpradeshon main gati hona jain dharm main 'yoga' kehalaata he or isi yoga ke madhyam se aatma main karm kii pudgalvarganaaon kaa jo sambandh hota he use asrav kehete hai
 There are two distinctions of infusion: sabhi sharirdhari atmaaon ko gyanavarnadi karmon kaa har samay bandha hota rahata he
 Souls suffering from attachment, illusion, item, anger, greed etc
 have a traditional infusion and those souls who are devoid of anger have an asapath infusion

 portland cement vartmaan samay kii saamaanya upyog main aane vaali puure sansar main sarvaadhik prachlit cement he
 It is the basic ingredient of concrete, slurry, etc
 cement kii vibhinn kismein uplabdh hai
 Portland cement is commonly used in ordinary construction work
 portland cement ke avishkaar se pehle tak jodne ke kaam main laae jane vaale padaarth saadhaaran chuunaa or buja chuunaa the
 Portland cement was invented in 1824 AD by an English Raj Joseph Espadin
 kathor ho jane ke gun tathaa england ke portland sthaan main pai jane vaali ek shila ke naam par iskaa naam 'portland' cement padaa
 Portland Cement is manufactured by mixing a mixture of limestone and gypsum in a fixed ratio at 1400 ° C
 The temperature at which the initial melting takes place is by heating
 aise praapt avshisht raakh ko thanda kar, phir piskar maheen churna banaaya jaataa he jiskaa 90% bhaag chalani sankhya 170 se chhan jaataa he
 Different varieties of cement can be obtained by adjusting the ratio of these three raw components and adding small amounts of other chemicals
 portland cement ke bade paimaane par nirmaan main jin khanijon kaa prayog hota he unamem silica, alumina, irun oxide chuunaa, magnisia hai
 On burning them there is a chemical combination between them
 cement ke mukhya ghatak hai, tri calcium silicket, daai calcium silicket tathaa tri calcium aluminete, iske atirikt pisane ke purv isamen lagbhag 3% jipsom milaane se cement kii utkrushtataa bad jaati he
 With this, the time of freezing of cement can be controlled
 cement main pani milaane se cement jamata or kathor hota he
 The reason is hydration and water decomposition of its above mentioned components
 praarambhik jamaav aluminete ke kaaran tathaa iske baad kii praarambhik majbootee pradhanthya tri silicket ke kaaran hoti he
 The action of disilicate is the slowest
 ise majbootee pradaan karne main 14 se 28 din yaa isse adhik lag jate hai
 === Quick Hardening Cement === Fast setting Cement becomes strong very quickly though its initial and final deposition time is slightly longer than normal cement
 isamen tri calcium silicket adhik hota he or yah adhik maheen pisa jaataa he
 Due to high production of heat and high contraction at the time of freezing and hardening, it is not widely used in concrete
 tri calcium aluminete ooshmaa vikaas kaa pramukh kaaran he
 Therefore, its quantity in cement is kept to a minimum, only 5%
 is prakaar kaa cement praarambhik avasthaaon main kam majboot hota he
 But there is no difference in its ultimate strength
 jald majboot hone tathaa rasinic prabhaavon ke viruddh drudh rahane ke liye iskaa prayog hota he, jaise behate hue pani athwa samudri jal main
 It is made on a large scale by smelting the mixture in appropriate proportions of alumina and calcareous substances and subsequently grinding the product fine
 aisa cement jamaav ke samay failata he
 a small amount of this is used in building fluid-bearing structures by mixing in other types of cement to prevent cracks in the concrete due to contraction and heat
 cement kaa dhoosar rang apdravya rup main irun oxide ke kaaran hota he
 If there is iron oxide in Portland cement, the color of the cement will be white
 irun oxide ke nikaalane kii laagat, jo prakritik padaarthon kaa saamanyat: ang hota he, safed cement kii keemat ko badha detii he
 Mixing about ten percent pigment while grinding white cement produces colored cement
 dhoosar cement main puraa tathaa laal rang safalataa se daalaa ja saktaa he
 Other main varieties of cement are air-mixed or air-fired cement, sulfate-resistant cement and water-soluble cement
 cement kaa ghan sampeden main banaaya jaataa he
 The cube is kept in a test machine and pressed or compressed until it breaks
 isse cement kii majbootee kaa pataa chalata he
 Standard bricks, of which at least one square inch, is broken to determine the tensile strength
 portland cement ke tanan tathaa sampeden samarthy nimnlikhit prakaar he
 Day --- Compression Strength --- Tensile Strength 3 dinon ke baad--- 1,600 --- 300 7 days after --- 2,500 --- 375 bharat main chuunaa pathar kii adhikta ke kaaran cement udyog kaa bhavishya bahut ujjwal he

 ajayraj shakambhari ke agnikuleey chouhanvansh ke praarambhik nareshon main se tha
 Ajayaraja, son of Prithviraj I, became an important ruler in the 12th century
 usne malwa ke parmaar shaasha narvardhan ko avanti nadi ke kinare haraakar apane rajya kii seemaa malwa tak badha lee
 According to 'prithviraj Vijay' he also defeated Ghazni's army
 ajayraj ne apane rajya kii raksha ke liye 1113 i
 ajmer naamak nagar kii sthapana karke vahaan taragarh naamak kile kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 Ajayraj made Ajmer the capital of the Chauhan Empire
 usne ajayapriyadramas naam ke sikke jari kiye
 The cultural significance of that time can be gauged from the progress of religion, tolerance and learning during his reign
 rajya vistaar ke liye to ajayraj vishesh prasiddh nahin he, par uski khyaati ajmer ke nirmaan ke kaaran kaaphi he
 In 1113 AD, he built a huge city of 'ajayameru' in his name and filled it with beautiful palaces and temples

 gurutvkarshan ek padaarth dwaara ek duusare kii ore aakrisht hone kii pravriti he
 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct
 unhone gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance
