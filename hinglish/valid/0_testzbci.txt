 Fast bowling is also known as pace bowling which is one of the two major types of bowling in the game of cricket
 doosraa prakaar he spin bowling
 Fast bowling players are often called fast bowlers, fastmen, pace bowlers, or pacemen, although sometimes bowlers who use a special technique of fast bowling are also called swing bowlers or seam bowlers
 tej gendbaazi kaa mukhya uddeshy hota he cricket kii sakht gend ko tej gati ke saath daalana or ise itnaa veg dena ki yah oochaal ke saath pich par bouns ho sake yaa hawa main hoti hui said se nikal jaye, taaki ballebaaz ke liye gend ko safai se hit karnaa mushkil ho jaye
 The speed of a typical fast ball is 136 to 150 km / h
 ab tak daali sabase tej gend kaa anadhikarik record 101
9 mile / ghanta main pakistan ke mohammad sami ke naam par darj kiya gaya he, yah gend bharat ke khilaaf ek match main daali gayi thi
 The fastest ball that was officially recorded was 161
3 km per hour and was delivered by Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan during a match against England at the 2003 Cricket World Cup
 is gend par khilne vaala ballebaaz nik nit tha, jisane leg said par hit kiya
 Although the speed of a ball from Brett Lee was later found to be similar, it was not recorded properly due to external interference in radar signals
 do back ap radaron ne is delivery ke liye 142 kimi / ghanta kii sahi gati ko darj kiya
 In most cricketing countries, fast bowlers are considered to be the mainstay of a team's bowling, while slower bowlers play a supporting role
 upmahadweep main, vishesh rup se bharat or srilanka main, aksar iskaa vipareet satya he, jahaan tej gendbaaz spinner ke liye sahi bhoomika nibhaate hai
 This is largely due to the position of the pitch used in these countries, which is more helpful to the spinner than the fast bowler, but internationally the spinner's specific skills are compared to the pace bowler
 iske vipareet, anya mukhya upmahadweep desh, pakistan, main kai kushal tej gendbaaz hue hai, kyonki is desh ko reverse swing main maharath hasil he or yahaan kii pichen tej gendbaazon ke liye adhik sahaayak hai
 It is possible that a bowler only focuses on speed, especially this is true for a young bowler, but as the fast bowler matures, he acquires many more skills and can be used to swing bowling or seam bowling
 His trend towards gendbaaj Most fast bowlers specialize in both of these in one area and are sometimes classified into strike, swing or seam bowlers
 haalanki yah vargeekaran santoshjanak nahin he kyonki shreneekaran paraspar vishisht nahin hota or ek kushal gendbaaz aamtaur par tej, swing, seem or kating gend kaa mishran daalata he, chaahe vah anya prakaaron kii tulana main kisi ek prakaar ko praathamikta de
 Instead, it is more common to categorize fast bowlers according to the average speed of their delivery, as given below
 in shabdon kaa upyog sandarbh ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye, crickinfo "tej-madhyam" or "madhyam-tej" shabdon kaa upyog antarpariwartit rup se karata he
 It is said that the fastest bowlers bowl at express speed
 tulana ke liye, peshewar cricket main adhikansh spin gendbaaz 45 se 55 meter prati ghanta kii ausat gati se gend daalate hai
 Some bowlers bowl with every type of ball change from fast to slow, this can cause some confusion as they can be placed in different categories, for example Brett Lee puts his fast ball at a speed of 145 km / h , Which makes him a fast bowler, although he sometimes bowls slower at a speed of about 120 kilometers per hour
 iske vipareet, anil kumble ek spin gendbaaz he, ve apekshaakrit tej gend daalate hai, jisaki gati 110 kilometre prati ghanta tak hoti he
 Although these figures are often ignored to determine which category a bowler fits, as the speed of the ball changes, the main intention behind it is to hit the batsman, not Setting a standard bowling speed
 tej gendbaaz jitna dhimaa hota he, utana hi use wicket lene ke liye neeche di gayi badlaav takneekon par adhik nirbhar karnaa padataa he
 Whereas fast and moderately fast-medium and medium-fast bowlers often dismiss the batsman with their quickness and speed
 vyavhaar main, bahut kam visheshgy gendbaaz madhyam shrenee main aate hai- is gati se gend daalane vaale gendbaaz aksar ballebaaz hote hai, jo zarurat padane par kuch over daal sakate hai
 These bowlers are called medium pacers
 madhyam-dhimi or dhimi-madhyam shreniyon main aksar spin gendbaazon ko rakhaa jaataa he, chunki tej gendbaazi kii takanic ke saath is gati se daali gayi gend, spin hone ke bajaay, aksar hit karne ke liye bahut aasaan hoti he
 Although the spinner is colloquially called a "slow bowler", very few players in professional cricket actually place the ball in the "slow" category
 pehali cheez jo ek tej gendbaaz ke liye jaruri he vah he gend ko sahi dhang se pakadana yaa grip karnaa
 To achieve maximum speed in basic fast bowling, the ball is held in such a way that the seam is directly up and the pointing finger and middle finger are placed near each other at the top of the seam and the thumb is just below the seam
 is
 sahi karne ke liye chhavi sahi pakad ko darshata he
 The first two fingers and the thumb form the grip on the ball, this part is slightly forward from the rest of the hand and the remaining two fingers are held together with the palm
 gend ko bilkul halake se pakadaa jaataa he, taaki yah haath se aasaani se chhot jaye
 Other types of grip are also possible, as a result of which a different type of ball is put - see below swing and seam bowling
 The bowler usually makes a grip on the ball with one hand and keeps the other hand on this arm for the maximum time possible, so that the batsman does not see what type of grip he is taking, or is preparing to take
 ek tej gendbaaz ko spinner kii tulana main wicket kii ore adhik lambe samay tak daudane kii zarurat padati he
 This long run generates a momentum in the ball for fast delivery
 tej gendbaaz wicket se duuri ko chinhit kar lete hai or apni is daud kii aavashyak duuri ko maap lete hai
 It is very important for the bowler to know the exact length of his or her run, as it must be finished at the popping crease
 agar gendbaaz is kris se aage nikal jaataa he to uske dwaara daali gayi gend no ball kii shrenee main aa jaati he
 At the end of the run-up or run, the bowler keeps his front foot on the pitch, keeping his knee straight as far as possible
 isse gend ko gati dene main madad milti he parantu yah khatarnaak ho saktaa he kyonki is ection se joint par dabaav padataa he
 Knee injuries are not uncommon among fast bowlers: English pace bowler David Lawrence, for example, was out of the game for months after his knee cap broke into two halves
 aage vaale pair par dabaav itnaa zyada hota he ki kuch tej gendbaaz apane pair ke anguuthe ko chot se bachaane ke liye apane juute ke agle hisse ko kaat dete hai, kyonki unhen baar baar juute ke vipareet dabaav daalana padataa he
 The bowler then lifts his bowling arm above his head and drops the ball by moving it to the appropriate height, where he thinks the ball should be bowled
 ek baar phir se, bhujaa sidhi honi chahiye haalanki yah gati ko badhaane main sahaayta dene ke bajaay cricket kaa ek niyam he
 Bowling the elbow makes it easy for the bowler to hit the batsman's wicket directly and dismiss it
 tej gendbaaz aise ection karte hai jisase ve ran-ap ke ant main said-on yaa chest-on rah jate hai
 a chest-on bowler's chest and ax are bowed when the batsman's back foot touches the ground, while a side-on bowler's chest and ax are bent at 90 degrees in the batsman's direction
 His back foot touches the ground
 west indies ke gendbaaz mailkam marshall chest-on gendbaaz ke ek achche udhaaharan the, jabaki australian tej gendbaaz denis lily said-on takanic kaa prayog karte the
 Although the action of a bowler does not affect the speed of the ball, it may limit the style of balls he bowls
 haalanki iske liye koi nirdhaarit niyam or kanoon nahin hai, said-on gendbaaz saamanyatya baahar kii ore swing karte hue gend daalate hai, jabaki front-on gendbaaz andar kii ore swing karte hue gend daalate hai
 Another type of fast bowler's action is the sling, in which when the bowler begins the delivery of the ball, his arm is fully extended behind his back
 sling se atyadhik gati utpann hoti he, lekin isamen niyantran ke saath samjhauta karnaa padataa he
 The most famous bowler to bowl with the sling is Geoff Thomson, who bowled at an extraordinary pace even after taking a short run-up
 vartmaan antarrashtriya khiladi jo sling ke saath gend daalate hai, unamem fidel edwards, shaun tet, lasith malinga or mishael johnson shaamil hai
 When the ball is bowled, the bowler "follows" at the end of his action
 isamen gendbaaz apni gati ko dhimaa karne ke liye kuch ore kadam daudta he or said main hote hue pich se baahar aa jaataa he
 While coming off the pitch at the end of the delivery, the bowler can damage the surface, causing uneven patches on the pitch, with spin bowlers often doing this to get the ball to rotate more; It is illegal according to the rules of the game
 jo gendbaaz pich par bhaagna jari rakhte hai, unhen chetavanee di ja sakati he, ek khel main aisi teen chetavaniyaan milane par gendbaaz us pari ke dauraan phir se gendbaazi nahin kar paata
 An effective fast bowler has to maintain a consistent line and length, or in general terms, it should be absolutely accurate
 In this context, the line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman when he is running in the horizon dimension from the off to the leg side
 jabaki length kaa taatpary us duuri se he jo gend ke dwaara ballebaaz kii disha main bouns hone se pehle tay kii jaati he
 The length is often more important for a fast bowler
 gendbaaz jitna tej hota he, utana hi line or length ko banaaye rakhana uske liye mushkil ho jaataa he lekin tej gati se gend ko jaldi daalaa ja saktaa he
 Fast bowlers who are perfectly accurate in this regard are extremely effective, for example, Australian fast bowler Glenn mcgrath and South African fast bowler Sean Pollock
 aadhunik cricket main, tej gendbaaz ke liye lakshyit line tathakthith rup se anishchit he; yah ballebaaz ke of stump ke thik baahar kaa kshetra he
 It is difficult for a batsman to tell whether such a ball will hit his wicket or not and thus he does not know whether to drop the ball or hit it to escape
 This technique was theoretically called off theory, but now it is so regular that it is rarely given any name
 Of course, line changes are also important and delivery delivered to the leg stump serves the purpose
 gend kii line kii sateek maharath kaa upyog sarvshereshth rup se tab kiya jaataa he jab ek ballebaaz ko ek vishesh shot ko hit karne kii kamajori ke liye janaa jaataa he, kyonki ek prabhavi line se saath gend daalane vaala gendbaaz sahi samay ke baad kamjor samay main gend daal saktaa he
 Not being able to consistently hit the ball on a certain line ends the career of innumerable batsmen, when they are dismissed to the ball of skilled line bowlers
 ek acchhee length kii gend vah hoti he jo ballebaaz tak pahunchane ke samay uski qamar kii unchai par hoti he
 There is no fixed distance for a good length, or in fact there is no other length for the ball in cricket, since the distance required varies according to the speed of the ball, similarly this distance is the state of the pitch and the bowler and batsman Also depends on the height of
 is baat par dhyaan diya janaa chahie ki is arth main ek "acchhee length" kii gend daalana hameshaa upyukt nahin hota-kuch sthitiyon main, kuch pichon par or kuch ballebaazon ke liye koi or length prabhavi ho sakati he
 The diagram on the right will help clarify what the different lengths mean
 ek gend jo acchhee length se jaraa sa pehle bouns ho jaati he or ballebaaz ke pet se adhik upar uth jaati he, use short pich kii gend kaha jaataa he yaa ise long hope ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he or ise hit karnaa ballebaaz ke liye aasaan hota he kyonki use yah dekhne ke liye adhik samay mil jaataa he ki gend kii oonchai or line bouns hone ke baad gadabadai he yaa nahin
 a short pitch ball is at the right height for the batsman, as he can put an aggressive pull shot on it
 ek gend jo acchhee length se pehle bouns ho jaati he or kandhe yaa sir kii oonchai tak pahunch jaati he, use bounsar kaha jaataa he or yah ek prabhavi delivery ho sakati he
 Any ball that is short enough to bounce above the batsman's head is usually called wide by the umpire
 short pich kii gend yaa wide ball daalana acha nahin mana jaataa kyonki isse ballebaaz ke liye apane aap ko bachaana yaa hamalaa karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 On the other side of the scale, the ball that bounces to the batsman instead of a good length is called a full pitch or over pitch ball, or is also described as a half volley
 acchhee length ke bajaay in gendon ko khelnaa ballebaaz ke liye adhik aasaan hota he kyonki seem se bouns hone ke baad unke paas hilne ke liye jayada samay nahin hota
 The ball placed near the batsman's foot is called a yorker, if it is bowled properly, it is a very effective length
 agar gend ballebaaz tak pahunchane se pehle bouns nahin ho paati to ise phul toss kaha jaataa he
 It is very easy for a batsman to play such a delivery, as it does not change its path due to the bounce off the pitch
 That's why three effective lengths) are easier for a batsman to hit, as control of the length is very important for a fast bowler
 duusari ore spin gendbaaz hameshaa acchhee length ko lakshya banaate hai parantu unhen line ko prabhavi banane or gend kii udaan par adhik niyantran rakhana hota he
 a fast bowler tries to stay physically fit throughout his cricket career, this period can be more than a decade
 yah kehane kii zarurat nahin he ki aisa karnaa bahut mushkil he or iske liye atyadhik anushaasan ke saath achche bhagya kii bhi zarurat hoti he
 Strike bowling is a type of bowling in which the bowler attempts to dismiss the batsman with high speed and quickness rather than throwing the ball in the air or off the pitch
 chotii ke ballebaazon ke khilaaf ye takneekein aamtaur par tabhi safal hoti hai jab tej gendbaaz ke dwaara tej yaa tej-madhyam shrenee main gend ko daalaa jaataa he
 Slow bowlers rarely use these techniques, especially against the end-of-the-line batsmen, but often the technique is reversed and the batsman is successful in scoring runs
 haalanki, aakraamak gendbaazi kii takneekon ko gendbaazi kii swing yaa seem takanic ke saath sanyukt rup se kaam main liya ja saktaa he taaki gendbaaz kisi bhi gati kii aisi gend daal sake, jise khelnaa sambhav naa ho
 inasvinging yorker ko vishesh rup se ghaatak mana jaataa he
 a bouncer is a ball that is inserted in the first half of the pitch, so that after that it has enough time to rise quickly and reach the height of his chest or head until reaching the batsman
 This may cause the batsman to face two types of problems
 agar vah ise khilne kaa prayaas karata he, to balla uski aankh ke str par hoga jisase shot lagane ke samay vah gend ko dekh nahin paayegaa or is shot ko khelnaa uske liye mushkil ho jayega
 If he leaves it, it can hit his chest or head and sometimes he may get hurt
 isi kaaran se, bounsar ko intimidtary gendbaazi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The normal response of a batsman to a bouncer is to duck it down, but this requires intense reflexes and reaction and sometimes the ball hits the batsman
 balle ko sidhaa kar ke apane sir ko bachaane kaa prayaas karnaa is sthiti main ek saamaanya pratikriya he, lekin agar sambhav ho to aisa nahin kiya janaa chahie kyonki aisa karne se gend ek aniyantrit kone par laut jaati he or ise aasaani se kaich kiya ja saktaa he
 Most of the batsmen are filled with panic and lose their wickets, thus adversely affecting the career of many batsmen
 shaareerik rup se shaktishaalee ballebaaz aksar aisi gend ko upar aane ke samay hit karata he, chaahe vah use dekh nahin paa rahaa hota, chunki yah asaamaanya nahin he, is sthiti main gend kii tej gati or ballebaaz ke balle donon ke sanyukt prabhaav ke kaaran gend boundry se baahar chali jaati he
 There is also the possibility that the wicket-keeper attempts to stop the ball, so for a skilled batsman this ball can be expensive in terms of runs
 ek dhimi gend vah gend he jise ection or ran-ap ke shabdon main saamaanya gati se daalaa jaataa he or isaki gati ko kam karne ke liye isaki grip ko halke se badal diya jaataa he
 This betrays the batsman, as he prepares to play the high-speed ball, his shot time being spoiled as the ball suddenly decreases
 aamtaur par iske parinamswaroop gend balle se takaraakar neeche kii taraf chali jaati he or balle kii gati dhimi rah jaati he
 Collides with energy, so energy transfers and speed decreases)
 Also, when the bat hits the ball, it has moved slightly and is in the upper part of its arc, causing the ball to return to a larger angle after being separated from the bat
 is sangyojan ke parinamswaroop dhimi gati se aati hui gend kaich ho jaati he, yah apekshaakrit ek aasaan kaich hota he
 In any case, the batsman plays this shot so quickly that it becomes clean bowled
 kai prakaar kii grip main se ek ko daayin ore dikhaaya gaya he
 Inevitably the only difference is that the middle and the finger tips are away from each other and come down either side of the seam
 iske kaaran jab gend haath se chhootati he, is par adhik khinchaav padataa he or delivery kii gati kam ho jaati he
 Slower balls are also bowled by the off spinner using off break grip and finger action
 kabhi kabhi ek leg spin grip or rist ection kaa upyog karke yaa gend ke upari hisse ko keval ek anguli kaa sahaara dekar bhi dhimi gend daali ja sakati he
 Slower balls are often effective against a batsman who wants to score fast
 natijatan, ek divasiy cricket ke saath isaki prabhavita bad gayi he or vishesh rup se ek pari ke ant main yah phydemand sabit hoti he jab ballebaaz aakraamak tareeke se score banane kaa prayaas kar rahaa hota he
 a more experienced batsman adjusts to the mid-stroke, at which time he hits the ball from the middle of the bat
 dhimi gend ke ek or prakaar ko slobe kaha jaataa he
 It is inserted with the top fingers only
 iskaa uddeshy hota he ek "bimar" daalana, delivery kaa yah prakaar gend ko ajeeb tareeke se deliver karata he or yah yorker length tak pahunch jaati he
 It was often balls delivered by Chris Cairns to Chris Red, ducking into full length and blowing the stumps
 yorker ek aisi gend hoti he jo thik ballebaaz ke pairon ke saamne pich par bouns hoti he, yah kshetra block hole kehalaata he
 Because of the batsman's general attitude and the regular length of the cricket bat, the bat is not usually placed near the ground when the batsman is preparing to strike the ball
 isliye yorker ko khilne ke liye ballebaaz ko turant apane balle kii unchai ko badalanaa padataa he, jaise hi use gyaat hota he kii gendbaaz ne yorker daali he
 It is difficult and often the ball goes out of the middle gap and breaks the wicket
 is prakaar kii delivery ko safaltaapurvak khel janaa ek yorker ko diging out karnaa kehalaata he
 The yorker requires very precise bowling, because if it is put too long, it will be full toss or full pitch delivery, which is easy for the batsman to play, because the ball comes to the bat without bouncing
 is
 ise hairaan karne vaali gend ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 For this two reasons, the yorker is not a commonly delivered delivery in most circumstances
 ek divasiy cricket main ek pari kii antim pravasthaaon main, ballebaaz har gend par prahaar karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 In such circumstances, the yorker is particularly an effective delivery
 is samay main yah wicket lene main madad karti he or gend ko boundry tak jane se rokatii he
 Therefore, under these circumstances a yorker is often thrown, in such a situation bowlers who can bowl a yorker are eligible for the award
 seem gendbaazi main gend kii seem kaa upyog is prakaar se kiya jaataa he kii yah jab pich par takaraati he to apratyaashit rup se bouns ho jaati he
 a good batsman anticipates where the ball will bounce and it gives him an idea of what his height will be when the ball reaches him
 By creating changes in the bounce, the bowler creates the possibility that the batsman may have made a mistake in his guess and lost his wicket
 seem delivery ko kisi bhi gati ke saath daalaa ja saktaa he, parantu seem gend daalane vaale gendbaaz madhyam, madhyam-tej yaa tej-madhyam gati se gend daalate hai
 The basic technique of seam bowling is normal fast bowling or slow ball grip and an attempt to ensure that the seam always remains upright until the ball hits the pitch
 agar seem sidhi khadi avasthaa main he or gend apane kshitij aksh par spin ho rahi he, koi saraahneey maganas prabhaav utpann nahin hoga or gend hawa main gati nahin karegi
 gend kii seem ko uthaaya jaataa he or jisase bouns or gati main badlaav utpann hota he agar yah pich ko hit karne vaali gend kaa pehla hissaa he
 Seam bowlers can benefit greatly from particular types of pitches
 sakht pich jisaki sataha kati fatty hoti he, seem gendbaazi ke liye sarvshereshth hoti he, kyonki pich ke sakht hone ke kaaran gend adhik aasaani se bina apni gati khoye bouns hoti he, jabaki sataha ke asamtal hone ke kaaran gend apratyaashit rup se bouns hoti he, jab vah pich se takaraati he
 This is called variable bounce
 kabhi kabhi atyadhik sakht or asamtal pich ko khilne ke liye khatarnaak ghoshit kar diya jaataa he kyonki ballebaaz gend ke bare main koi purvanumaan nahin laga saktaa or iske parinamswaroop baar baar unke sharir par gend ke hit hone kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Green pitches are also helpful for seam bowlers, as small tufts of grass serve an uneven surface, although the effect is mixed because the green surface also slows the ball
 seem gendbaaz atyadhik chapati or samtal sataha par prabhavi nahin hote or seem gendbaaz aksar aisi sataha par gendbaazi kii ugr ranneeti or / yaa bowling katrs kaa istemaal karte hai
 The term cutter is used to describe a fast ball that is spinning
 yah ek aise prakaar kii delivery he jo seem ko sidhaa rakhane ke bajaay vipareet aksh ke chaaron or gumti he
 Although this type of rotation is not as beneficial as spin bowling, the small changes it produces can be inconvenient for a batsman, due to the speed of the ball
 kattar seem gendbaaz ke liye prabhavi tarika he
 If they are not getting more help from the pitch then they can benefit from this type of ball movement
 seem ke chaaron or ghurnan karne vaali gend jab pich se takaraati he tab vah daayin yaa baayin taraf chali jaati he, yah is par nirbhar karata he ki gend kis taraf spin ho rahi he
 The ball bouncing to the right is called an off cutter as it moves from an off stump to a leg stump for a right-handed batsman
 iske vipareet, baayin or bouns hone vaali gend leg kattar kehalaati he kyonki yah ek daayen haath ke ballebaaz ke liye leg stump se of stump kii taraf jaati he
 The cutter is usually inserted so that it hits the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and goes away from the wicket
 isse gend balle ke madhya bhaag se takaraane ke bajaay uske bahari kinare se takaraayegi or laut kar aane par iske kaich honi kii sambhaavna bad jaayegi
 The bowler uses a different type of grip or grip to insert a cutter type of ball
 daayin or grip ke do prakaar darshaae gaye hai, sabase upar vaala leg kattar utpann karata he jabaki neeche vaala ek of kattar utpann karata he
 Similarly, to change the grip, the bowler has to bring his fingers down to the side of the ball, to produce the necessary spin when releasing the ball
 Cutter bowling increases the stretch on the ball and reduces the speed of the ball like a slow ball and also helps to confuse the batsman
 swing gendbaaz seem gendbaaz ke vipareet gend ko pich se dur naa daalkar, ise hawa main daalata he
 Normal or traditional swing bowling is done by lifting the seam of the ball, and traditional swing is usually highest when the ball is new and therefore has a clear seam
 jaise jaise gend puraani ho jaati he, ise swing karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he, lekin aisa kiya ja saktaa he agar kshetrarakshan karne vaali team gend ke ek said ko tareeke se polish kar de or duusari said ko bina polish ke hi rahane diya jaae
 jab gend kii ek said ko atyadhik polish kar diya jaataa he or duusari said ko chhod diya jaataa he or ise tezi se daalaa jaataa he, yah reverse swing utpann karti he jisase gend parmparik swing kii tarah vipareet disha main swing ho jaati he
 Contrary to popular opinion, this swing does not occur because air flows faster over the smooth or "shiny" side than on the rough side
 swing ek said se gend par kaam karne vaale ek shuddh bal ke kaaran utpann hota he; arthath vah said jisaki seemaa parat adhik ashaant hoti he
 For traditional swing bowling, the raised seam and the direction in which it is raised determine the direction of the swing
 gend ke koniya seem ke kaaran, seem ke upar se bahane vaali hawa is said par ashaanti utpann karti he, jis taraf seem mud jaati he
 This causes the liquid boundary layer to separate from the ball surface compared to the other side where the laminar layer boundary first separates
 This creates a net pressure difference, thus the net force moves the ball in the direction of the angular seam and swings it
 paaramparik swing gendbaazi ko seem kone ke saath deliver kiya jaataa he taaki gend kii chikani or polish kii hui sataha saamne kii ore hoti he, gend ko seem kii disha main arthath khurdari sataha kii ore gati detii he
 a swinging ball is called an out swinger if it moves away from the batsman, or it is called an inswinger, if it moves towards the batsman
 adhikansh maamalon main outswinger ko adhik khatarnaak gend kaha jaataa he, kyonki agar ballebaaz ise pahchaan naa paae to yah balle ke madhya bhaag se takaraane ke bajaay isaki bahari kinare se takaraati he or slip ho jeet hai, ise is avasthaa main aasaani se kaich kiya ja saktaa he
 Inswinger also has its own importance, especially when combined with the yorker, as inswinger collides with the inner edge of the bat and breaks the wicket, or hits the batsman's pad instead of the bat, There is a possibility of LBW as a result
 swing gendbaazi ko mote taur par jaldi hone vaali swing yaa der se hone vaali swing main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he kii apane prakshep vakr path ke dauraan yah apni disha ko kab badalati he- gend jitani baad main swing hoti he, ballebaaz ke liye swing ke anusaar apane shot ko samyojit karne kii sambhaavna utani hi kam ho jaati he
 Swing balls are also inserted with the same grip and technique as the grip and technique used in fast bowling
 haalanki seem ko sidhaa rakhane ke bajaay halke se kone par jhukaa diya jaataa he or gend kii ek dhimi grip kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 For an outswinger, the shiny side of the ball is close to the batsman and the seam is tilted at an angle in the opposite direction, while for the inswinger, the rough side should be closer to the batsman and the seam must be tilted towards him
 Swing is difficult with a cutter grip, since the ball spins during flight, any rough or shiny surface can come in front of the batsman, as it is flying in the air
 khel main kai khilaadi, tippaneekar or prashansak is baat se sahmati jataate hai ki nam yaa ghatatope paristhitiyon main gend ko adhik aasaani se swing kiya ja saktaa he or saath hi ek divasiy match main prayukt safed gend kii tulana main test cricket main kaam main lee jane vaali laal gend adhik swing hoti he
 Reverse swing is a phenomenon that causes the ball to swing in the opposite direction
 jab gend reverse swing hoti he, us samay gend chamakili said kii ore swing karti he
 The reverse swing occurs slightly later than the traditional swing and occurs more quickly, both factors increasing the batsman's difficulty in preparing to hit the ball
 saamaanya swing kii tulana main reverse swing paristhitiyon par adhik nirbhar karata he, isliye ise lagaataar hasil karnaa lagbhag asambhav he
 The reverse swing usually does not occur until the ball has been used for about 45 overs and requires hot and dry weather
 reverse swing kii takanic ko sabase pehle 1980 ke dashak main pakistani gendbaazon ke dwaara khoja gaya tha lekin tab se lekar ab tak yah cricket khilne vaale sabhi deshon main fail chuki he
 In the reverse swing, the rough surface is placed forward
 seem ko usee tarah se kone par jhukaaya jaataa he jaise paaramparik swing main parantu seemaa parat donon sidon par ashaant hoti he
 The net effect of the seam and rough surface is that the ball actually swings in the opposite direction to which the swing is bent
 acchhee reverse swing gendbaazi ke liye aavashyak he ki gendbaaz bahut tej gati se gend daale, yah gati duniya main gine chune tej gendbaaz hi hasil kar sakate hai
 Now, in one day cricket it is mandatory to change the ball after 35 overs, this is done to reduce the reverse swing
 is prakaar se, kshetrarakshan karne vaali team ke liye 35 over ke baad gend ko badalanaa anivaary hota he or isliye reverse swing nahin hota
 The dipper is a swinging ball that is thrown with the intention of throwing a yorker or full toss, but it turns into a dipper as opposed to the bowler's choice
 indippar daayen haath ke ballebaaz kii ore gati karti he jabaki outdippar usase dur jaati he
 To be effective, a dipper must have a lot of swing to vary its speed, as the ball is not bouncing on the pitch
 haalanki, kyonki aamtaur par ballebaaz ummid karata he ki phul toss par ran bananaa aasaan he, dippar hairaan karne vaali gend hoti he or ise khelnaa bahut mushkil ho saktaa he vishesh rup se yadi gendbaaz bahut sateek ho or phul toss ke bajaay yorker daalane main safal ho jaye
 Furious or aggressive bowling is a bowling strategy in which the bowler bowls the ball with the intention of hitting the batsman with the ball
 yah kuch had tak cricket ke niyamon ke khilaaf he, isamen ve niyam bhi shaamil hai jisamen bounsar ke atyadhik upyog kii anumati nahin di jaati, isamen "bimar" ke upyog kii bhi anumati nahin hoti, jiskaa lakshya puri tarah se ballebaaz ke sir ko hit karnaa hota he
 Successful offensive bowling usually involves a mixture of bouncers and short pitch deliveries, aiming at the batsman's head, chest, and ribs
 is ke peeche mukhya iraadaa hota he, ballebaaz kaa dhyaan bhatkaana, taaki vah galati kare or apana wicket kho baithe
 Often the wicket does not fall on the ball of a bouncer or short pitch, but instead the wicket falls on a normal delivery that the batsman was not expecting, or the batsman fails to play in his normal way
 iske peeche ek pramukh drushtikon hota he, ballebaaz kii chaati ko lakshya banaate hue kai short pich kii gende daalana, jisase ballebaaz balle ko unchaa karke apane aap ko bachaane or pichley pair par khilne ke liye majaboor ho jaataa he or iske baad tej yorker daali jaati he, jisamen stump ke aadhaar ko lakshya bane jaataa he
 If the batsman raises the bat and prepares to play on the back foot, the amount of time the bowler takes to prepare for it is enough to cause the batsman to panic and thus lose his wicket
 ek tej gendbaaz bhi ballebaaz ko krodhit karne yaa use chidhaane ke liye aakraamak gendbaazi kar saktaa he, jisamen vah ballebaaz ko lakshya banaate hue gend daalata he
 Aggressive bowling is used to varying degrees by every fast bowler and even the best batsman is sometimes seriously injured and forced to leave the game
 lagbhag sabhi maamalon main maukhik 'apshabdon' kaa hamalaa bhi iske saath kiya jaataa he
 Excessive use of offensive tactics by good bowlers is not considered in the spirit of the game and iska virodh by many teams and players
 iske atyadhik upyog kaa ek udhaaharan tha bodiline shrinkhalaa, jisamen tatkaaleen english cricket captain duglas jardin ne australian cricket team ke star khilaadi donald breadman par aakraamak gendbaazi kaa prahaar kiya
 In this he was putting very fast and short balls, aiming at the batsman's body, his intention behind this was to hurt him personally
 bodiline shrinkhalaa ke baad cricket ke kai niyamon main parivartan kiya gaya, taaki bhavishya main is prakaar kii ranneeti ke upyog ko roka ja sake
 aise kai kshetrarakshakon par pratibandh laga diya gaya jo is prakaar kii ranneeti kaa upyog karte the
 Because almost all cricket teams have many fast bowlers of varying speed and style, the technique of fast bowling varies not only with the field but also with the bowler
 gendon ko daalane ke anukram ke saath bhi is takanic main parivartan aata he
 The exact strategy depends on many factors, these factors include the state of the game, the state of the pitch, the weather and relative energy, and the level of skill of the different players who bowl
 tej gendbaazi ke liye atyadhik urja kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, adhikansh tej gendbaazon se ummid kii jaati he kii ve lagaataar ek saath chaar se chah over tak gendbaazi karne ke baad hi aaraam karen
 paristhitiyon ke anusaar unhen isse zyada samay tak bhi gendbaazi kerani pad sakati he, lekin isse aamtaur par unki prabhavita main kami aati he or gendbaaz thak jaataa he
 The choice of what type of ball will be bowled and the order in which the balls are bowled depends on the bowler himself
 adhikansh pakshon main tej gendbaazon kaa ek mishran maujuud hota he, jo ugr or / yaa seem takneekon main visheshgy hote hai or kuch gendbaaz swing main visheshgy hote hai
 When the ball is new it usually swings very little but it exhibits extreme speed, bounce and a variety of seams
 isiilie nayi gend se gendbaazi karne ke liye seem gendbaazon ko chunaa jaataa he, jab pari shuru hoti he, yaa jab khel ke dauraan nayi gend laayi jaati he tab seem gendbaazon ko gendbaazi karne kaa avasar diya jaataa he
 The fielding side is also given the option of playing with the 80-over ball
 iske vipareet, jab gend reverse swing karnaa shuru kar detii he, us samay swing gendbaaz adhik prabhavi hote hai
 Reverse swing bowlers can produce excessive speed in balls older than 80 overs
 pehle 10 over ke baad agranukram main aamtaur par do seem gendbaazon kii apeksha kii jaati he, is samay ke baad gend swing hone lagati he or un donon yaa donon main se ek ko swing yaa spin gendbaazi kaa mauka diya jaataa he
 This is why most teams have at least two seam bowlers, called opening bowlers
 puraani gend ke saath aamtaur par seem gendbaazi aprabhavi ho jaati he or 60 over ke baad lagbhag bekaar ho jaati he or iske parinamswaroop isliye team main swing ke saath spin gendbaaz bhi hone chahie
 The fielding of a fast bowler is usually fiery, so in that sense it can be said that its purpose is to take wickets and not to stop the batsman from scoring runs
 kabhi kabhi, vishesh rup se tab jab kshetrarakshan team baad main ballebaazi karti he or lakshya score banaae kaa prayaas kar rahi hoti he, us samay surakshatmak kshetrarakshan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 As a general rule, protective fast bowling is a difficult task - it is better for spin bowlers
 tej gendbaazi kii vibhinn takneekein teen tareeke se ballebaaz ko out kar sakati hai
 They can either be bowled or lbw with speed, the yorker or by the seam or swing can the ball be thrown towards the batsman, in which context the placement of the fielder is irrelevant
 swing yaa seem kaa upyog gend ko ballebaaz se dur daalane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, is maamle main gend balle ke bahari kinare se takaraayegi or udaan ke dauraan kaich kii ja sakati he
 a badly played bouncer either hits the outside edge or goes up or can result in a foul play time and can be caught near the boundary
 iske liye aakraamak tej gendbaazi karne vaale sabase prabhavi kshetrarakshakon ko outfield or slip cordan or gulii main tainaat kiya jaataa he, kyonki in sthitiyon main ballebaaz ke kaich hone kii sambhaavna sabase zyada hoti he
 There is the added advantage of deploying fielders in the outfield, which reduces the number of places for a batsman to score runs in the boundary
 anya najadik kshetrakshan sthitiyaan jaise sili mid on / of or kai midwicket sthitiyaan aamtaur par anaavashyak hoti hai
 Conversely, a defensive zone for fast bowling packs multiple positions around the batsman such as gullies, points and full circle
 ek yaa do slip or ek yaa do outfilder kaich kii sthiti main rahete hai
 Because the batsman usually tries to put a shot on the ground to avoid the risk of a catch, in this type of fielding, the entire field is so closed that if the batsman makes even one attempt, he can be run out
 rakshaatmak tej gendbaazi mushkil kaam he kyonki ek kushal ballebaaz is prakaar kii takanic ke liye taiyaar rahata he or boundry se ran score kar letaa he, jab vah midwicket ring par yaa kisi maujuud outfilder se dur hit karata he
 The primary goal of any bowler is to take the wicket of the batsman
 doosraa lakshya hota he use ran banane se rokna
 dusre vaala aksar pehle vaale ke liye maarg banataa he, kyonki jab ballebaaz ran nahin bana pataa, vah pareshaan ho jaataa he or score banane ke liye jokhim bhare shot lagane kaa prayaas karata he
 In addition, a bowler would usually bowl for the same batsman in a row to prevent the batsman from scoring runs, giving him the opportunity to establish some sort of technical sequence
 iske anusaar, wicket par lagaataar gend daalana tej gendbaaz ke liye uchit drushtikon nahin he, kyonki yah ballebaaz ko spasht or aasaan pratikriya ke sanket detaa he
 The batsman saves his wicket and also faces a bad ball
 iske peeche ek or drushtikon he ek line or length kii gendbaazi ke dwaara anischitata utpann karnaa, jisase ballebaaz yah faislala nahin le paata ki vah hamalaa kare yaa apane aap ko bachaae
 mishrit prakaar kii delivery main ballebaaz ko yah nahin paata hota ki agali gend kisi hogi
 In a good bowling, most balls are usually swings or seams that come up to the waist, coming out of the off stump and away from the batsman, as this is the area where it is difficult for the batsman to respond most appropriately
 
 aam bhinnataaon or unki ranneetiyon kii charchaa neeche kii gayi he
 The exact balls the bowler chooses during an over depends on the position of the match, depending on the skill of the batsman, as well as how long the batsman has been at the crease
 us ballebaaz par hamalaa karnaa aasaan hota he jo abhi abhi wicket par aayaa he, use out karne ke liye bounsar or short pich kii sahaayta se us par hamalaa kiya ja saktaa he or use zyada samay tak aakraamak ballebaazi ke liye tikne se roka ja saktaa he
 Short balls are risky for a batsman who has stayed at the crease, as they take easy boundaries, but most bowlers still bowl mixed balls, so that the batsman keeps trying to guess
 zyaadaatar ballebaaz front yaa back foot shot lene kaa prayaas karte hai or yah gendbaaz kii gend ke chunaav ko prabhavit karata he
 Short ball is difficult to play on the front foot, so bowlers prefer short ball to the batsman who plays on the front foot
 isi tarah, yorker or phul pich gend ko back foot par khelnaa mushkil he isliye is prakaar kii delivery kaa upyog back foot vaale ballebaazon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 If a bowler successfully puts such balls in opposition to the batsman, he can surprise the batsman by suddenly putting the opposite type of ball - a yorker after several short pitches or a bouncer after several full balls
 a batsman who is not a good observer loses his wicket inadvertently in such a situation
 ek or bhinnata, vishesh rup se us ballebaaz ke liye jo wicket par tik chukaa he or swatantra rup se ran bananaa shuru kar rahaa he, yah he ki thik of stump ke baahar se hamale kii line ko badalanaa or sidhe leg stump par gendbaazi karnaa
 The batsman has to react appropriately to these types of balls as either he can score runs or is at the risk of LBW, but when he does so his bat comes over the leg side and leaves the off side unprotected
 is
 agar gendbaaz swing yaa seem takanic ke saath of said par paryaapt gati utpann kar saktaa he to yah aksar balle ke bahari kinare se takaraati he or sidhe stump par ja lagati he
 It should be remembered that surprise is a major element in bowling, bowlers often use these common strategies to confuse the batsman, so that he makes a wrong shot
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek nae ballebaaz par yorker daalana jo bounsar kii ummid kar rahaa tha, yaa kam se kam kai baar maanak line or length kii gend kai balbajon ko pehali hi gend main out kar detii he
 Human body cannot take the burden of fast bowling
 tej gendbaazi puure sharir par atyadhik dabaav utpann karti he, vishesh rup se pair, peeth or kandhon par
 In this, many parts of the body are at risk of injury
 isamen takhne kii haddi tuutane kii sambhaavna hoti he, kyonki delivery ke samay pair jab jameen par padataa he, to is par kaaphi dabaav padataa he
 There is a possibility of spasm and strain in the back as the body is rotated in an arc at the time of delivery of the ball
 kandhe ke snaayu ke fatne kii sambhaavna hoti he kyonki gend ko daalane se thik pehle kandhe par achaanak ek jhatka lagata he
 He is the top fast bowler who has scored at least 850 points in the ICC Player Rankings as of June 2009

 Bajirao II was the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire from 1796 to 1818
 inke samay main maratha samrajya kaa patan hona shuru hua
 During his reign, conflict with the British began
 bajirao dwitiya aathvaan or antim peshwa tha
 He was the son of Raghunathrao
 apane pradhanmantri naanaa fadanvis se bajirao dwitiya sadaa nafrat karata rahaa
 After the death of Nana Fadnavis, he himself wanted to take charge of the Maratha Empire
 bajirao dwitiya ek kaayar or vishwasghaatee vyakti tha, jisane angrezon kii sahaayta praapt karke peshwa kaa pad praapt kiya tha
 But even with the British, he was not proved to be true
 uski dhokhebaazi or beimaani ke kaaran angrezon ne use bandi banaakar bithur bhej diya, jahaan 1853 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Bajirao II befriended the British and with his help received the post of 'peshwa' and gave many Maratha territories to the British for that
 bajirao dwitiya swaarthee or ayogy shaasha tha tathaa mahattvakankshi hone ke kaaran apane pradhanmantri naanaa fadanvis se irshyaa karata tha
 Fadnavis died in 1800 AD and Bajirao himself became anxious to take power
 lekin vah sainik gunon se rahit or vyaktigat rup se kaayar tha or samajhataa tha, ki keval chal kapat se hi apane lakshya ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 After the death of Nana Fadnavis, there was rivalry between Daulatrao Shinde and Jaswantrao Holkar for his vacant post
 bajirao dwitiya chal kapat se in donon ko hi apane niyantran main rakhana chahta tha, jisase maamla or ulajh gaya
 Shinde and Holkar started a war outside the gates of Poona to take the Peshwa under their control
 bajirao dwitiya ne shinde kaa saath diya, lekin holkar kii sena ne un donon kii sanyukt sena ko parajeet kar diya
 The frightened Peshwa Bajirao II fled to Basai in 1801 and took refuge in the British and signed Basai's treaty on 31 December 1802 on an English ship
 iske dwaara usne east india company kaa ashrith hona sweekaar kar liya
 The British pledged to re-incarnate Bajirao II in the capital Poona and to protect the Peshwa, he took the responsibility of having sufficient army in the state
 iske badale main peshwa ne company ko itnaa maratha kshetra dena sweekaar kar liya, jisase company kii sena kaa kharch nikal aae
 He also promised that he would not hire people from other European countries who had enmity with the British
 is prakaar bajirao dwitiya ne apni raksha ke liye angrezon ke haath apni swatantraaa bech di
 The Maratha chieftains expressed their indignation towards the treaty of Basai, as they felt that the Peshwa had sold all their freedoms due to their queerness
 at: un logon ne is aapattijanak sandhi ko samaapt karaane ke liye yuddh kii taiyaari kii
 This resulted in the Second anglo-maratha War, in which the British won and established their sovereignty over the Maratha territories
 sandhi ke dwaara lagaaye gayi pratibandh peshwa bajirao ko achche nahin lage
 He took advantage of the resentment and discontent prevailing among the Maratha chieftains and re-organized them against the British
 navambar 1817 main bajirao dwitiya ke netritv main sangathit maratha sena ne puna kii 'angrezi residensi' ko lootakar jala diya or khadki sthiti angrezi sena par hamalaa kar diya, lekin vah parajeet ho gaya
 Subsequently, he fought two more battles - Bhima Koregaon in 1 January 1818, in which the British defeated 27,000 Maratha soldiers of Peshwa by his army, which was less than the number of Marathas, including 500 Mahar soldiers
 Later defeated in the battle of Ashti
 usne bhaagane kii koshish kii, lekin 3 june, 1818 i
 ko use angrezon ke saamne aatmasamarpan karnaa padaa
 The British abolished the post of Peshwa this time and overpowered Bajirao II and sent him as a prisoner to Bithoor near Kanpur where he died in 1853 AD
 maraathon kii swatantraaa nasht karne ke liye bajirao dwitiya sabase adhik jimmedaar tha

 Dolia • Khond • Bhoi • Rathwa • hakim abul kasim firdausi tusi farsi kavi the
 He composed the Shahnama which later became the national epic of Persia
 isamen unhone saatvin sadi main faras par arabi fatah ke pehle ke iran ke bare main likhaa he
 Firdausi was born in 920 AD in a town called Tus in Khorasan
 asadi naamak kavi ne use shiksha di or kavita kii ore prerit kiya
 He gave him a treatise on the mythological kings of Iran, on the basis of which Firdausi composed the Shahnama
 isamen 60,000 sher hai
 He was busy with this great work for 35 years and completed it on 25 February 1010 AD
 is samay vah 85 varsh kaa ho chukaa tha
 He dedicated this poem to Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi who conquered Khorasan in 999 AD
 use keval 20 hajaar dirham pradaan kiye gaye
 Firdausi's body was set on fire
 vah apane desh se hiraat kii ore bhaaga kintu bhaagane se purv ek kavita shahname main jod gaya, jisamen sultan mahmud kii ghor ninda kii gai he
 In the Shahnama, Firdausi praised the legendary emperor of Iran, whose exploits he was greatly influenced by, the elder
 uski kavita se pracheen iran ke prati uskaa prem evam arabon ke prati ghrinaa kaa puraa abhas miltaa he
 In order to possibly satisfy the staunch Muslims, he later wrote Yusuf Zulikha, a masnavi dedicated to the Bavid ruler Bahauddaula and his son Sultanuddaula
 taduparant vah apni mathrubhumi toos laut aayaa or vahiin uski mrityu hui 
 His grave is in the sights of Iran
 kaha jaataa he, jab uskaa janaaza paas ke ek gaanv ke phatak se nikal rahaa tha, ek kaaravaan sultan mahmud ke bheje hue 60,000 dinar lekar pahunchaa jinaki kavi ko aashaa thi
 Firdausi's daughter put all the money in charity
 shahnamaa kii badi hi sundar sachitr hastlipiyaan sansar ke bade bade sangrahalayon main surakshit hai
 Its editions were published from Calcutta in 1878 AD from Paris in 1878 and Lyden from 1877-1885 AD
 taduparant bharat or iran se anek sanskaran prakashit hue
 Its translations have been published in many languages of the world
 kaha jaataa he ki mahmud gazanvi ne firdausi ko yah vachan diya tha ki vah 'shahnamaa' ke har shabd ke liye ek dinar degaa
 After years of hard work, when the 'shahnama' was ready and Firdausi took him to the court of Mahmud Ghaznabi, the emperor paid him a dirham, not a dinar for every word
 kaha jaataa he is par naaraaz hokar firdausi laut gaya or usne ek dirham bhi nahin liya
 This promise was something like that a penny should be given to a poet by paying a rupee per word
 firdausi ne gusse main aakar mahmud gazanabi ke khilaaf kuch panktiyaan likhi
 Those lines were so influential that they spread throughout the empire
 kuch saal baad mahmud gazanvi se uske vishwaasapaatr mantriyon ne nivedan kiya ki firdausi ko usee dar par bhugtan kar diya jaye jo tay kii gayi thi
 When asked about the reason of the emperor, the Prime Minister said that in every corner of the empire we go, we get to hear the lines that Firdausi has written against you and we just bow down in shame
 use nirdhaarit dar par paisa de diya jaayegaa to hamen bada naitik bal milegaa
 The Emperor gave the order
 dinaaron se bhari gaadi jab firdausi ke ghar pahunchi to ghar ke andar se firdausi kaa janaaza nikal rahaa tha
 Firdausi was dead after spending his entire life in poverty, poverty and failure
 kehete hai ki firdausi kii ekmaatr santan uski ladki ne bhi yah dhan lene se inkaar kar diya tha
 In this way the emperor remained a debtor of the poet and still is today
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki aaj firdausi kaa shahnamaa jitna prasiddh he utani hi yaa usase zyada prasiddh ve panktiyaan he jo firdausi ne mahmud gazanabi kii aalochana karte hue likhi thim
 Firdausi's 'shahnama' is not only the history of Iran but the identity of Iranian identity
 usamen pracheen iran kii uplabdhiyon kaa bakhaan he
 Emperors have a history
 pracheen farsi granthon ko nayaa rup dekar unako shaamil kiya gaya he
 a wonderful effect has arisen from the blending of myth and history
 prem, vidroh, veerta, dushtataa, maanviyata, yuddh, saahas ke aise utkrisht udhaaharan hai jinhone 'shahnamaa' ko irani sahitya kii amar kriti bana diya he
 No other book has appeared in Iranian literature as often as 'shahnama' has been printed
 firdausi ne rustam or soharaab jaise paatr nirmit kiye hai jo maanav-smriti kaa hissaa ban chuke hai
 There is a beautiful garden around the tomb of Firdausi, as Iranians have done with their great poets
 idhar-udhar unki pratimaayein lagi hai
 Special episodes of his poetry are engraved on marble

 anuvanshiki or rog main bahudhaa koi na koi sambandh rahata he
 Many diseases are caused by contaminated environment and conditions, but there are many diseases due to which there is a defect due to birth from parents
 e rog anuvanshik rog kehalaate hai
 There are some diseases that arise as a result of both genetics and environmental influences
 jeevon main nar ke shukranu tathaa stri kii andkoshika ke sanyog se santan kii utpatti hoti he
 Both the sperm and scrotum contain nucleus
 in cendrakasutron main sthit jin ke swabhavanusaar santan ke maansik tathaa shaareerik gun or dosha nishchit hote hai
 Because of one or a few genes being defective, only those defects occur in the child
 kuch dosha main se koi rog utpann nahin hota, keval santan kaa shaareerik sanghathan aisa hota he ki usamen vishesh prakaar ke rog sheeghra utpann hote hai
 Therefore, to know for sure whether the cause of the disease is heredity or adverse environment is not always feasible
 anuvanshik rogon kii sahi gananaa main anya kathinaaiyaan bhi hai
 For example; Many congenital diseases appear only when they are old
 duusari ore, kuch anuvanshik doshayukt bachche janm lete hi mar jate hai
 The disease is manifested in each generation due to their effect on the presence of antitussive pathogenic genes, but diseases caused by the degraded gene occur spontaneously in any offspring of the offspring, as evident by Mendel's hereditary rules
 kuch rog ladakiyon se kahin adhik sankhya main ladakon main paae jate hai
 Many examples of genetic diseases can be given
 inamen se kuch nimnlikhit hai : Cataract, hyperpigmentation, glaucoma, long-sightedness, etc
, occur due to defect of anticonvulsant gene
 tirohit jin ke kaaran vivarnataa, astigmatism, keratoconus, ityadi rog utpann hote hai
 Sexually transmitted genital diseases, which are more prevalent in men, are diseases like blindness, night blindness, night blindness etc
 inamen ek sau se adhik anuvanshik rogon kii gananaa kii gai he
 Among these are psoriasis, ichthiasis, keratosis, etc
 adhikangulata, yuktangulata, kai prakaar kabonapan, asthiyon kaa uchit reeti se na viksit hona, janm se hi nitambasthi kaa ukhda rahanaa ityadi Haemophilia, special types of anemia etc
 madhumeh, gathiya, chehre kaa vikrut tathaa bhayaavah ho janaa ityadi
 Heredity, epilepsy, hypnosis may also be the cause of heredity
 vividh rog, jaise bahraapan, goongaapan, kataa hont, videern taalu aadi bhi anuvanshikta se prabhavit hote hai
 Apart from this, heredity causes inclination towards diseases like esophagus, high blood pressure, cancer etc

 kaab vah prastaav manjuur karata he or apni team ikatthi karata he, jiname se vah: ams, ek shaatir thag or jaalsaaj baharoopiya; yusuf, ek chemist jiske paas ek behad tej nashili dawa he jo "sapane ke bheetar ek or sapana" dekhne kii kshamta badhaata he; ariadne, ek architekchar kii chaatra jise sapanom ke dauraan bhulabhalaiya jaisi rachanaayen banane kaa jimmaa miltaa he,jiske intjaam kii sifarish kaab ke sasur, professor stephen miles karte hai
 Sayto remains attached to the team to ensure their success
 par jab ariadne saajhe sapanom ke saath kaab ke antarman main jhaankne kii koshish karti he, to use ehsaas hota he ki mail uske antarman main dakhlandji karanevaale par aksar hamalaa kar baahar kar detii he
 At the same time, Robert Fisher takes him on a ten-hour flight to get him cremated in Los Angeles after Maurice Fischer arrives in Sydney, with his team keeping the occasion solemn and Fisher's shared dream in every possible way Plan outlines
 sapanom kii tah main lagbhag harek level main ghuskar vaapis aane ke liye, un sabhi sadasyo ko gahari neend se ekasaath jagaane ke liye lagbhag ek hi "jatke" ke jarurat he
 According to the plan, at the first level Yusuf drops the car from the bridge, at the second level, Arthur resorts to the elevator and at the end of the third level, Aims, taking out everyone together through an explosion
 lekin sapanom kii duniya main marane ke baavjood ve us tej dawa ke asar se jaag nahin paayenge jinase unhone anginat level ke sapanom ko der tak banaae rakhane kaa seven kiya tha
 Here, they will be caught in a "limbo" or almost coma-like situation with death, where there will be infinite and infinite gaps of inner being which are very difficult to escape
 pehle sapane kii tah main, team yusuf ke sapane ke jariye barsaat bhare las angeles main daakhil hoti he
 Here the team arrives to abduct Fischer, but his bodyguard composed in his rescue system shoots there and injures Sayto
 surakshit thikaane par ams fiqar ke hi gadfadar ankal peter browning kaa rup dharkar, rabart ko uske apane pita ke vasiyat par dubaara gaur karne kii salaah dete hai
 Eventually the team escapes with Yusuf on the van, escaping those badguards, during which the team is now ready to enter the second level
 yahaan duusare sapane kii tah main, arthur ke banaae khyalaati hotel main, kaab tab fiqar ko yakeen dilaataa he ki uske ankal browning ne hi apharan kii sajeesh rachi he or vah ek antarman kii suraksha visheshgy hone ke naate yah baat jaanata he
 Cobb persuades him to enter Browning's heart to go to the next level

 Here, the team of CAB tries to break into pieces and move inside to remove the guards so that the fissure can be coordinated
 yusuf, apane pehle level ko anusaran karte hue, gaadi drive karte hue pul se giraata he or jald hi pehla jhatka shuru karata he
 This removes gravity from Arthur's level, causing ice to slide at Ames' level
 ams, fouran vine ke pani se takaraane se purv ek saath jatke se ubarne kii taiyaari main jute jaataa he
 But in the projecting of the cab, Mel then shoots Fischer, and as soon as the severely wounded Sayto dies, both of them are lost in that uncertain world
 is darmyaan ams jatke kii taiyaari ke durg main jagah-jagah visphotak lagaataa he, kaab or ariadne tab fiqar evam saito dundhane ke liye coma main jate hai
 The cab then tells Ariadne about going into limbo through her and Mel's shared dreams
 jahaan donon ne takreeban pachaas saal apni yaadon se duniya banaate hue vakt guzaara tha
 But Mel refuses to return to reality, as Kaab unwittingly puts his mind into thinking that his world is not true, and that his early lessons were shaped
 haalaanki, jab wo neend se jaagi, to mail ko yahi yakeen hone lag gaya ki wo vaastavik duniya main nahin he
 To "wake up" in her real world, she commits suicide, forcing her to die with the cab
 katl ke aarope se bachane ke liye, kaab america se faraar hota he, or bacchon kii dekhbhaal professor miles ke jimme saunpta he
 With this cousin confessing, Cobb succeeds in his atonement, and departs from the conscience in the final endless world to find Sayto, leaving him relaxed
 ariadne bhi fiqar ko khoj nikaalte use jhatka dilaakar jagaati he
 Fisher is alive again in that mountainous fortress, where he has to find the safe room, through the dying father in it, to motivate him to the idea: where his father asks him to be his own
 udhar kaab or saito ke alaava baaki sabhi sadsy ek hi vakt main bhinn jhatkon se vaastaviktaa ko lautati he: jaise ariadne kaa balakani par se kud janaa, ams ke lagaae visphotak jo durg ko tabah karte he, arthur dhamaake ke jariye alevator main maujuud soyi hui team ko takaraav se jagaata he, or vine bhi tab tak pani kii sataha se takaraata he
 The cab finally reminds her of her accolades, having found the aged Sayto in that interim world
 donon phir usee hawaizhaj main jaagate hai, jahaan pehle hi baaki kii team or rabart fiqar jaag chuke the
 At the Los Angeles airport, Cab receives clearance at the US Immigration Detection Center and takes her father-in-law to her children while they wait

 Their conductivity can also be changed by an electric field or light applied from outside
 yahan tak ki inaki vidyut chaalakata ko tanakar yaa dabaakar bhi badla ja saktaa he
 Because of these properties, these semiconductors work as devices for amplifying light and other electrical signals, making switches controlled by electrical signals, and as energy converters

 Silicon is most commonly used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices
 anya padaarthon kii tulana main iske mukhya gun hai kachche maal kii kam laagat, nirmaan me aasaani or vyapak taapmaana parichaalan seemaa
 Currently, the first silicon for manufacturing semiconductor devices is made by making a boule of at least 300mm width, so that it can be made of such a wide wafer
 pehle jarmenium kaa prayog vyapak tha, kintu iske ushn atisamvedansheeltaa ke karan silicon ne isaki jagah le lee he
 Today, kudhatu of germanium and silicon is often used in the manufacture of superfluous devices; IBM is a major producer of such devices

 China started showing bigotry to India, which also forced India to make hydrogen bombs
 iske baad bharat ne sikret mishan ke tahat parmaanu bam bananaa shuru kiya or 11 may 1998 main atal vihari vajpayi kii sarkaar main hydrogen bam kaa safal pareekshan kiya
 The Government of India did not allow any country to even get the news of this test and as soon as the test was done, there was chaos in the whole world

 The United Nations imposed all kinds of economic sanctions on India, which Atal Bihari Vajpayee had to suffer and India's economic development suffered greatly, but the advantage was that China stopped showing us bigotry
 aaj bharat china se bhi tej gati se vikaas kar rahaa he
 Apart from India, Pakistan and Israel also claim to have hydrogen bombs, but Israel has not tested any atomic bomb till date and Pakistan did not have the edge in testing which should be in a hydrogen bomb

 is anuchhed ko vikipedia lekh Ecosystem ke is sanskaran se anudit kiya gaya he
 An ecosystem is a natural unit that includes all organisms of a particular region, ie plants, animals, and molecules that interact with their abiotic environment to form a complete biological unit
 is prakaar paaritantr anyonyashrith avyavon kii ek ikai he jo ek hi awaas ko baantate hai
 Ecosystems usually form numerous food webs that show the interdependence of these organisms and the flow of energy within the ecosystem
 paristhitiki tantra shabd ko 1930 main roy clafam dwaara ek paryaavaran ke sanyukt shaareerik or jaivik ghatakon ko nirupit karne ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 British ecologist Arthur Tansley later refined the term, describing it as "the whole system 


 not only the organism complex, but also the whole complex of all the physical factors that we call the environment"
 tansle paaritantron ko na keval prakritik ikaiyaan ke rup main, balki "maansik isolats" ke rup main bhi maanate the
 Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "ecotope"
 paristhitiki tantra avadharana kaa mukhya vichaar yah he ki jivit jeev apane sthaneey parivesh main har duusare tatv ko prabhavit karaten hai
 Eugene Odum, a founder of Ecology said: "an entity that includes all organisms that affect the physical environment is that a flow of energy within the system is a clearly defined nutritional structure, biotic variation and material cycle an ecosystem
 " maanav paristhitiki tantra avadharana phir maanav / prakruti dvibhajan ke vyakhya par aadhaarit he or is aadhaar par he ki sabhi prajatiyaan ek duusare ke saath or unke biotope ke abiotic angeebhoot ke saath paristhitikta se ekikrut hai
 The biome is similar to an ecosystem in which a seasonally and geographically defined ecology refers to areas of similar climatic conditions, such as plants, animal communities, and soil organisms, often referred to as ecosystems
 bioms sanyantr sanrachanaon, patta prakaar, sanyantr antaralan or jalwaayu jaise karkon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit kiya jaataa he

 The biodiversity conference, recognized by more than 175 countries, became particularly politically important after the "ecosystem, Conservation of Natural Habitats and Maintenance of Populations of Developable Species in the Natural Environment" by the commitment of the countries that approved the UN Environment Program As to identify spatial ecosystems from it and a political need has arisen for their distinction
 CBD "paristhitiki tantra" ko is prakaar paribhaashit karata he: "paudhe, jaanavar or sookshm jeev samudaayon kaa ek gatyatmakai parisar or unka nirjeev paryaavaran jo ek kaaryaatmak ikai ke rup main kaam karte hai

 The structure and meteorological elements of the respective vegetation, he said, are each modifiable determinants complemented by ecological data that partially separate distinct species
 yah na keval vanaspati prajatiyon ke liye sach he, balki pashuon kii prajatiyon, kavak or jeevanu ke liye bhi sach he
 The amount of detection of the ecosystem is subject to the physiognomic modifier that can be identified in an image and / or region
 jahaan aavashyak ho, vishesh pashuvarg tatwon ko joda ja saktaa he, jaise kii pashuon kii mausami sandratha or pravaal kii chattan kaa vitaran

 From the perspective of science, ecosystems are not discrete units that can only identify the right to a "right" classification approach

 "basic life-base services upon which human civilization depends," and whether direct or indirect, are called ecosystem services
 Examples of direct ecosystem services are: pollination, wood and erosion prevention

 This is not a universal case and there is species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services at a sustainable level: moist tropical forests and extremely vulnerable to change, much less the production of goods and services There is no direct connection between proven, while many temperate forests within a lifetime or a forest fire to their previous state of immediate development Grow back after the tie
 The exploitation of grassland for several thousand years is permanent
 ek paristhitiki tantra main nae tatv kaa parichay, chaahe jaivik yaa ajaev, ek vighatnkaaree asar hota hai
 In some cases, it may lead to an ecological failure or "hierarchical nutritional chain" and the death of many species within the ecosystem

 Ecosystems are predominantly stochastic, these events provoke reactions on non-living materials and conditions are reactions events driven by the ingredients surrounding them
 is prakaar, is maahaul main tatwon se uttejnaa karne ke liye jeev ke vyaktigat pratikriyaaon kaa yoga se ek paristhitiki tantra parinaam he
 The presence or absence of population depends only on reproduction and proliferation success and the population level fluctuates in response to stochastic events
 As the number of species in an ecosystem increases, the number of stimuli is also high

 While other local, sub-populations go continuously, later to be replaced through the spread of other sub-populations, the population will move in extinction because some species will disappear, given the great diversity among organisms on Earth
 Most ecosystems are only very Gradually, changed
 Stochastists kuch aantarik viniman tantra prakruti main jo ghatit pahchaan he
 Feedback and feedback mechanisms at the level of this species, most notably regulate the level of the population through regional behavior
 Andrewatha and Birchie suggest that the level of regional behavior tends to keep populations where food supply is not a limiting factor

 The relationship between the ecological system and ecosystem ecology is very complex
 paristhithi-vigyaan tantra zyaadaatar paristhitiki tantra paristhiti-vigyaan ke upasamucchy maane ja sakate hai
 Ecosystem ecology has brought many methodologies into use, which has little to do with the overall view of the ecological system

 While the definition of ecosystem ecology can be called the scientific study of ecosystems, the special effort of ecosystems is the study of effects on ecological systems and mechanisms of phenomena
