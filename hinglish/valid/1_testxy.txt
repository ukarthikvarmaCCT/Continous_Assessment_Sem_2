 Ozone concentrations over Antarctica in the lower atmosphere will increase by 5% -10% by 2020 and reach pre-1980 levels by 2060-2075, 10-25 years later to reach levels that have been predicted in earlier estimates

 Strong controversies were generated by the representatives of the aerosol and halocarbon industries on the Roland – Molina hypothesis
 board ke adhyaksh dupont ne kaha kii ozon riktikaran siddhant "ek vigyaan kii katha he
 

 absolutely nonsense "
 President of Precision Valve Corporation Robert Abplanalp wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine about Rowland's public statements complaining
 Despite this, most of the core assumptions made by Rowland and Molina were confirmed by laboratory measurements They were given and certified by direct observations in the stratosphere

 mcelroy and Wofsy carried on the work of Rowland and Molina and demonstrated that bromine atoms are more effective catalysts for ozone destruction than chlorine atoms, arguing that bromine-containing organic compounds called halons, their widespread in fire sedatives Used, they were the main source of bromine of the stratosphere

 However, they were initially rejected by data quality control algorithms as inappropriate; The ozone hole was detected only in satellite data when the raw data was rechecked for evidence of ozone depletion in situ observations
 jab software jhande ke bina lautaa to ozon chhed ko peeche 1976 main dekha gaya tha
 Susan Solomon, an atmospheric chemist in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, reported that the chemical reaction on the polar stratospheric cloud in the cold Antarctic stratosphere has a vast amount of chlorine, albeit local and seasonal increases that lead to ozone

 yah mana jaataa he ki donon ke swabhaav alag the or vyavsaay kaise kiya jaae is par alag raay thi
 While Mr

 Should be done in estate so that profit is made / profit is made

 In 1982, Reliance Industries / Reliance Industries stood up against the rights issue of partially convertible debentures
 yah afvaah udai gai ki company apane stock mulyon ko ek inch bhi na gine dene ke liye bharsak prayaas kar rahi he
 Considering the opportunity, a bare cartel which was a group of stock brokers from Calcutta started retailing Reliance shares
 isko rokane ke liye, ek stock brokaron kaa samooh jise haal tak main "reliance ke mitra" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa rahaa reliance udyog ke chote bikri kiye hue share bombai stock exange se kharidne lage
 The beer cartels were acting on the belief that the Bulls would be short of cash to complete the transaction
 or ''badla '' vyapaar pranali jo kii us samay bombai stock exange main jari tha ke tahat samjhaute ke liye taiyaar honge

 bahut saare log yah samaj nahin paae ki sankat ke samay main ek dhaage kaa vyapaaree kuch saalon pehle itani badi nakad raashi kaise bana saktaa he / paa saktaa he

 In spite of his magic touch, Ambani was known for his flexible values and immoral instincts that ran in him
 unke jeevani lekhak khud is baat ko sweekaarte hai ki aniatik vyavhaar or avaidh kaaryon ki kuch ek aisi ghatnaayen hai jiskaa unhone khud anubhav kiya jaise ki saarvjaanik mudra kaa vikrutikaran karnaa jabaki ve dubai main petrol pump par ek maamuli karmchaaree the

 Goenka and Ambani became rivals with Ambani's corrupt business habits and Goenka was unable to get his fair share due to his illegal / illegal actions
 baad main, ramnath goyanka ne nasali wadiya ko samarthan ke liye chunaa
 At one time, Ramnath Goenka is believed to have said 'nasli is an English man
 He could not handle Ambani

 The local people forbade them not to go inside the temple, the worship is closed and the person who is going inside is dying
 unhone kaha ki agastya rishi to hamaare devtaa hai, ham to darshan karenge hi 
 He went in, saw and if nothing happened to him, the local people requested him to maintain the worship system in the temple itself

 This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Pythagorean theorem
 pithagoras prameya eucalidia jyamiti main kisi samakon tribhuj ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek sambandh bataane vaala prameya he
 This theorem is usually expressed as an equation in the following way- jahaan c samakon tribhuj ke karn kii lambaai he tathaa a or b anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai he
 Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician
 paramparanusaar unhen hi is prameya kii khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he, haalanki yah mana jane laga he ki is prameya kii jaankaree unase purv tithi kii he
 This theorem is given in the ancient Indian Buddhist Buddhist Shulbasutra
 kaaphi pramaan he ki babylon ke ganitagyon bhi is siddhant ko jaanate the
 It is also called 'boudhayan-pythagoras theorem'
 agar ham karn kii lambaai ko c or anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai ko a or b lete hai, to prameya ko nimnlikhit sameekaran ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: or, yadi c pehle se diya gaya he or ek bhujaa kii lambaai nikaalnaa ho, to nimnlikhit sameekaran kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he : or yah sameekaran samakon trikon ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek saral sambandh pradaan karata he
 The generalization of this theorem is called the 'cosine rule', with the help of which the length of the third side of any triangle can be calculated if the length of the remaining two sides and the angle between them is measured
 yah ek aisa prameya he jiske anya pramayon kii tulana main sambhavtah sarvaadhik pramaan gyaat hai 
 In the book Pythagorean Theorem, composed by Elisha Scott Loomis, 367 evidences are given
 boudhayan prameya ke adhikansh pramaanon kii tarah, yah do samroop tribhujon kii bhujaaon ke samaanupati hone ke gun par aadhaarit he
 Let ABC be a right angled triangle, in which angle c is right angled, as shown in the figure
 ham c bindu se karn par lamb daalate hai or bhujaa AB ke saath us lamb kii lambaai h hai
 This new triangle ACH is similar to our triangle ABC, because they both have right angles and a is their angle
 iskaa matlab he kii teesraa kone bhi donon tribhujon main samaan he
 On this basis, triangle CBH is also similar to ABC
 in samarupataaon se hamen do samaanupaat praapt hote hai: like tathaa They can also be written as in do samikarnon kaa sankshep karne par, In other words, the Boudhayan theorem: euclid ke tatwon main, pustak 1 kaa prastaav 47, boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit linon ke saath ek tark se sabit hota he
 A, B, c are considered the vertices of the right triangle, in which the right angle will be on A
 Drop a perpendicular from a to Karna opposite the square at the hypotenuse
 The line divides the square at the hypotenuse into two imports, each having the same area as one of the two legs being square
 aupchaarik pramaan ke liye, hamen chaar praathmik lemmata kii aavashyaktaa he: The simple idea behind this proof, which can make it easy to follow, is that the two squares above are transformed into a parallelogram of the same size, then folded and the left and right rectangles are converted to the lower squares, then continuous
 In area
 pramaan nimnanusaar he: This proof appears in Euclid's Elements as Proposition 1
47
 james e
 garfield ko ek upanyaas bijiy pramaan dwaara shrey diya gaya he: The entire trapezium is half of the left square, so its area = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 trikon 1 or trikon 2 prayek kshetrafal ab / 2 he
 The area of triangle 3 is c2 / 2 and it is half of the square on the hypotenuse
 lekin trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal bhi = - Hence the square on the hypotenuse = the sum of the squares of the other two sides
 is pramaan main, karn par varg plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan ko anya do parshvon main virgon ke rup main jod sakate hai plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan
yah pramaan china se darj kii gai he
 From Euclid's proof diagram above, we can see three identical figures, each with a "triangle over a square"
 kyunki bada trikon do chote trikon se bana he, uskaa kshetrafal in do chote kaa jod he
 By analogy, the three squares are in the same ratio with each other as the three triangles and the area of the larger square is the sum of the area of the two smaller squares
 viparyay se pramaan ko chithran or anemeshan ke dwaara diya gaya he
 In this example, the area of each large square is 2
 donon main, charon samaan trikon kaa kshetrafal hataa diya gaya he
 The remaining regions, a2 + b2 and c2, are equal
 Q
E
D This proof is indeed very simple, but it is not preliminary, in the sense that it does not depend only on the most basic theory and theorems of Euclidean geometry
 vishesh rup se, jab trikon or virgon ke kshetrafal kaa sutara dena bahut aasaan he, yah sabit karne ke liye aasaan nahin he ki ek varg kaa kshetrafal uske tukdon ke kshetron kaa jod he
 In fact, proving the necessary properties is harder than proving the Pythagorean theorem
 In fact, this difficulty affects all simple field-involved Euclidean proofs; For example, to get the area of a right-angled triangle involves an assumption that it is half the area of a rectangle of the same height and plane
 isi kaaran se, jyamiti ke liye swayansiddh parichay aam taur par trikon kii samanta ke aadhaar par ek or pramaan kaa prayog karata he 
 In the third graphic illustration of this Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse fits the square of the sides
 ek sambandhit pramaan yah dikhaa saktaa he kii punah sthapit bhaag mul ke samaan hai or, kyunki samaan kaa jod samaan he, kii unke kshetra bhi samaan hai
 To show that a square is the result, we have to show the length of the new sides equal to c
 Note that for this proof to work, we need to handle the way to cut a smaller square into more parts
 As the sides become smaller and smaller
 is pramaan kaa bijiy bhinnrup nimna tark dwaara pradaan kiya gaya he
 Looking at the illustration which is a large square with equal right-angled triangles at the corners, the area of each of these four triangles is given by an angle with C
 in trikon ke A-parshv kone or B-parshv kone anupoorak kone hai, nile kshetra ke prayek kone samakon hai, is kshetra ko ek varg banaate hue jiske parshv kii lambaai c he
 The area of this square is C2
 In this way the area of the whole is given: haalanki, bade varg ke parshvon kii lambaai a + B, ham uske kshetrafal kii gananaa kar sakate hai jaise 2, jo A2 + 2AB + B2 main vistaarit hota he
 The Buddhist theorem can be arrived at by studying the following diagram of how a lateral change can produce a change in the hypotenuse and using a small algorithm
 parshv a ke da main parivartan ke parinaam swarup, For a change in the similarity and difference of a triangle
 char ke viyojan par
 The result is the addition of a second term to the change in side b
 samekit detaa he When a = 0 then c = b, then b2 is "continuous"
 isliye As can be seen, this square is due to the special ratio between the changes and the sides, whereas the independent contribution of changes to the sides is the result of an amount that is not clear from geometric proofs
 is die gaye anupaat se yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he kii parshvon main parivartan parshvon se pratipanupati anupaat hai
 This differential equation suggests that this theorem is due to the related transform and its derivation is almost identical to the line integral computation
 yah maatra da or dc kramshah a or c main atyant chote parivartan hai
 But we use the real numbers Δa and Δc instead, then the ratio of their ratio is da / dc when their size is zero proximity, derivative and c / a are also close, the ratio of the length of the sides of the triangle and the result of the differential equation
 It shows
 is prameya kaa viparyaay bhi sach he: For any three positive numbers a, b and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle whose sides are a, b and c and every triangle has a right angle between the sides whose lengths are a and b
 yah viparyaay euclid ke tatwon main maujuud hota he
 This can be proved by using the cosine method, or by the following proof: ABC ko ek trikon maanate hai jiske parshvon kii lambaai a, b or c he, a2 + b2 = c2 ke saath
hamen yah sabit karnaa he ki a or b parshvon ke bich ke kone samakon he
 We construct another triangle in which there is a right angle between the sides whose length is a and b
 paaythagorian prameya se, nimnanusaar he ki is trikon ke karn lambaai bhi c he
 Since the sides of the two triangles have the same length, a, b and c, they are congruent and therefore must have the same angle
 Therefore, the sides that have length a and b in our original triangle have a right angle between them
 paaythagorian prameya ke viparyaay kaa ek anumaan he kii nirdhaaran karne kaa ek saral tarika he kii yadi ek trikon samakon, obtyus, yaa acute he, is prakaar se
jahaan c ko teenon parshvon main lanbaa chunaa gaya he: a Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b and c, such as a2 + b2 = c2
 In other words, a Pythagorean triple describes the length of the sides of a right angle where the integer length of all three sides is
 uttari europe ke bade pattharon se bane smarakon se sakshya yah dikhaate hai ki aise tripal likhane kii khoj se pehle se jane jaanate the
 Such triples are commonly written
 Some famous examples are and ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , One of the results of the Pythagorean theorem is that the unstructured length, such as the square root of 2, can be constructed
 ek samakon jiske pair donon ek ikai ke baraabar hai uske karn kii lambaai 2 kaa vargamul he
 The proof that the square root of 2 is irrational was contrary to the long-held belief that everything was rational

 The distance formula in Cartesian coordinates is derived from the Pythagorean theorem
 agar or chauras main ank hai, to unke bich kii duuri, jise yucalidian duuri bhi kaha jaataa he, jo diya jaataa he More generally, the Euclidean n-difference, the Euclidean distance between two points, a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ , = \ ,} and a = { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle a \ , = \ ,}, the Pythagorean theorem Is defined, using: euclid ke tatwon main boudhayan prameya ko saamanyakrit kiya gaya tha: If one erects a similar figure on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the two smaller ones is equal to the area of the larger
 boudhayan prameya, parshvon kii lambaai se sambandhit adhik saamaanya prameya kaa ek vishesh cese he, kosine kii vidhi: If two vectors v and w are given in this complex inner product space, then the Buddhism theorem takes the following form: vishesh rup se,||v + w||2 =||v||2 +||w||2 agar v or w ayty hai, haalanki viparyaay kaa sach hona zaruri nahin he
 Using mathematical induction, the previous result can be extended to a rectangular vector in a finite number of pairs

 v1, v2,


, consider vn to be a vector in an inner product space containing = 0 when 1 ≤ i γ
 isliye, a2 + b2 > c2 hota he
 Triangles that have an obtuse angle have α + β <γ
 isliye, a2 + b2 < c2 hota he
 Edsjar Dijkstra calls this proposal about the Akyut, right-angled and obtuse triangles in this language: jahaan kone α parshv a ke vipareet he, kone β parshv b ke vipareet he or kone γ parshv c ke vipareet he
 The theory of Euclidean geometry derives from the Pythagorean theorem, in fact, the Euclidean type of the Pythagorean theorem stated above does not occur without Euclidean geometry

 ) For example, in spherical geometry, the length of the three sides of a right-angled triangle of unit area limited by octet is equal to π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2}; Euclidean violates the Pythagorean theorem because π / 2 { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ pi / 2} iskaa matlab he kii bina yucalidian prameya main, paaythagorian prameya ko yucalidian prameya se ek alag rup lenaa chahie

 Using the mclaurin series for this cosine function, it can be shown that the radius r reaches infinity, as it is, the spherical form of the Pythagorean theorem approaches the Euclidean form

 In hyperbolic geometry, a right triangle can also be written for, jahaan a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} rekha khand ab kii samanta kaa kone jo a ̄ { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ bar {a}}} jahaan μ gunatmak duuri prakaarya he 
 In hyperbolic trigonometry, the equality of the angle of the sine satisfies is prakaar, yah sameekaran rup letaa he Where a, b, and c are the negative distances of the sides of the right triangle

 The Pythagoras formula is used to find the distance between two digits in a Cartesian coordinate plane and is valid if all the coordinates are real: digits {2 + 2)
 But with complex coordinates: examples, digits {and {i The distance between, 0} will remain zero, which results in redactio ad Absurdum
 This is because this formula relies on the theorem of Pythagoras, which in his Huss proofs, depends on the area
 Is su and the area depends on the triangle and on other geometric figures that separate the inside from outside, which would not have been possible if the coordinates were complex

 Pythagoras, whose dates are generally dated to 569–475 BC, used the algebraic method to construct the Pythagorean triple, according to Proclos' commentary in Euclid
 Proclus, however, wrote between 410 and 485 AD

 The West Land is a modern 434-line poem written by TS Eliot, first published in 1922
 ise 20 veen sadi kii sabase mahatvapurn kavitaaon main se ek bhi kaha jaataa he
 Despite the poignancy of the poem — it is a journey between satire and prophecy, with the unexpected change of the speaker, the mournful literature of place and time, culture and literature — the poem has become a familiar criterion of modern literature
 iske prasiddh muhaavaron main hai "april ij da krolest manth" ; "ai vil sho you fier in a handphul of dust"; or sanskrit bhashaa kaa mantra " om shantih, shantih, shantih " Eliot may have worked on the poem The Waste Land for a number of years before its first publication in 1922
 neuyork ke ek vakil or aadhuniktawaad ke sangrakshak jon queen ko 9 may 1921 ko likhe gaye ek patr main, aliot ne likhaa ki " mere paas ek lambi kavita he, jo dimag main he or aanshik rup se kaagaj par likhi bhi ja chuki he, main use puraa karnaa chahta hoon
" Richard Aldington recalls that when Eliot read the draft of The West Land's manuscript in London "a year or so ago", Eliot came to visit him in his country, walking into a cemetery as he did Thomas Gray's Allegi Returns in a country began to discuss the church-yard poem
 eldington likhte hai: mujhe yah jaan kar aashcharya hua ki aliot ne itani lokapriy cheez kii prashansa kii or phir usne kaha ki agar ek samakaleen kavi, grey kii tarah apni simaaon ko jaanata he, tabhi vah aisi kavita ke sabhi uphaaron par dhyaan kendrit karegaa, jo use isi prakaar kii safalataa ke kaaran mil sakate hai
 " aliot, ko jinhen kuch snaivik vikaar tha, chikitsakon dwaara aaraam karne kii salaah di gayi thi
 He applied for three months' leave from the bank; The reason given on his staff-card was "nervous breakdown"
 He and his first wife, Vivienne high-wood Eliot, traveled to the coastal resort of Margaret for recovery
 vahaan rahete hue, aliot ne 'westlend' kavita par kaam kiya or sambhavatya ezara pound ke praarambhik sanskaran ko darshaya, jab landan lautne ke baad, aliot ne navambar 1921 main paris kii yatra kii
 There he was a guest of Pound
 aliot ne doctor roger vitos se upachaar lene ke liye logen, switzaraland kii yatra kii, otoline morel ne use is doctor se milane kii salaah di thi; viven ko us samay paris ke baahar senetorium ke baahar ruknaa padaa
 logen main, aliot ne kavita kaa 19 prishthon kaa ek sanskaran taiyaar kiya
 He returned from Lausanne in early January 1922
 pound ne tabhi is par sampadakeey-tippaniyan kin or pandulipi main kai katautiyaan kin
 baad main aliot ne kavita ko pound ko samarpit kiya
 Eliot sent a manuscript manuscript draft to John Quinn in October 1922; Which reached Quinn in New York in January 1923
 queen kii mrityu ke baad is kavita kii pandulipi kaa draft unki bahan julia anderson ko viraasat main mila
 Many years later, in the early 1950s, Mrs
 Anderson's daughter Mary Conori found the contract in a museum
 1958 main usne nijee rup se inhen neuyork ke saarvajanik pustkaalay ko bech diya
 The existence of the book was not known until April 1968, and the drafts of the manuscript were not known to the poet's second wife and widow, Valeris Eliot
 1971 main, 'febar and febar' ne mul draft kii ek "pratikruti or pratilekh" kaa prakaashan kiya or ise veleri aliot ke dwaara sampadit ankit kiya gaya
 The whole poem is replicated before Pound's editorial changes
 kavita ke draft se pataa chalata he ki mul kavita antim prakashit sanskaran kii tulana main lagbhag duguni thi
 As editor, Ezra Pound 'ruthlessly quarreled' in it and due to the many suggestions he gave, the creator himself removed many large parts of it

 The 'the Typist Home at Tea Time' section was originally in the regular verse of the Panchpadi verse, which had the verses of Aabab, the same scheme used in Gray's Allegi, which Eliot had in mind at the time
 Were living
 pound ne draft ke is khand ke bare main kaha "padya utana ruchikar nahin he jab ki kavita isaki varantee detii he
 "finally, the regularity of the four-line verse was abandoned

 jaisaa ki richard elman ne iskaa varnan kiya he "uske shauchalay ko pope ke belinda kii tarah banane ke bajaay, freska joyas ke bloom kii tarah isamen ja rahi he
 "these lines are: elman ke anusaar "pound ne aliot ko chetavanee di ki klyonki pope ne dohon ko behatar banaaya he or joyas ne shauchalay ko, isliye kisi or round kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Pound wanted to include some short poems that Eliot wanted to insert between the five volumes
 in main se ek he, jahaan se aliot ne 'shoakgeet' ko kuch yon shuru kiya
 At the request of Vivian, Eliot's wife, a line was removed from the 'A Game of Chess' section: And we shall play a game of chess / The ivory men make company between us / Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door "this section is apparently based on her married life and she appears to be revealing these lines
 haalanki, da "iveri main" kaa arth aliot ke liye kuch or ho saktaa he: 1960 main, vivian kii mrityu ke teraa saal baad, unhone landan ke pustkaalay ko bechi jane vaali ek pratilipi main pankti ko daalaa
 In a letter to Eliot to commemorate the poem's "birth" in late December 1921, Pound wrote a 48-line poem
 The title of this poem was "sage Home"
 In this, Eliot was called the poet's value, but was compared to his mother
 kuch chand hai: Eliot had already found the publisher before editing began
 neuyork se horas livrit, boni kii ek prakaashan form se the, livrit ne ejra pound ke saath kai baithkon main hissaa liya
 During dinner on 3 January 1922, he offered to publish the works of Pound, James Joyce and Eliot
 aliot ko niojit kavita ke sharad sanskaran ke liye pustak kii 15 pratishat railty di gayi
 To increase his income and reach the maximum readership, Eliot tied up with magazines
 dial magazine ke liye landan se sambandhit hone ke kaaran iske sah maalik or sah-sampadak ke college mitra, scofield thair ke liye dial ek adarsh vikalp tha
 Although Dial offered $ 150 for the poem, Eliot resented that the entire year's work would be priced too low, as another contributor was willing to pay a considerable price for one of his short stories
 dial ke saath sauda lagbhag tay tha lekin pound ke prayaason ke saath ant main sauda tay hua, 150 dollar ke lava aliot ko dial meggin ke dwitiya vaarshik puraskaar ke liye chunaa gaya, kyonki usne apni vishisht sevaayen uplabdh karaayin thim
 a prize of $ 2000 was awarded

 Bonnie and Liveright used the promotion of Dial's prize to boost their initial sales for Eliot
 kavita ko pehle britain main lekhak ke note ke bina prakashit kiya gaya, ise ek saahitiyik patrika da criterion ke pehle sanskaran ke liye prakashit kiya gaya tha, jiskaa sampadan khud aliot ke dwaara hi kiya gaya tha
 The poem was first published in the US in November 1922 in the edition of The Dial magazine
 disambar 1922 main, kavita ko boni or livrit kii pustak main prakashit kiya gaya
 In September 1923, 'hogarth Press', a private press run by Eliot's friends Leonard and Virginia Woolf, published the first British edition of The West Land, with 450 copies by Virginia Woolf
 da west land ke prakaashan itihaas kaa varnan donald geoup ke vruttchitr main kiya gaya he
 Eliot's 1922 salary at Lloyds Bank was £ 500, he made about £ 630 with Dial, Bonnie & Liveright and Hogarth Press publications
 aliot multah is kavita ko he do da polis diferent voises sheershak dena chaahate the
 In the poem's version, Eliot brought the first two volumes of poetry from Switzerland - 'the Burial of the Dead' and 'A Game of Chess' - which appear under this title
 in ajeeb vaakyanshon ko charles dicans ke upanyaas aar mutual frends se liya gaya he, jisamen vidhwaa betty higdan apane god liye hue bete se kahati he "you mite note think it bat slopy iz a beautiphul reader of a news paper

 isse pathak ko yah samajhane main madad milegi ki haalanki kavita main kai alag alag awaajen hai, kuch aalochakon kaa maananaa he ki isamen ekmaatr kendriya chetana he
 By rejecting this title, Eliot must have felt that he had reinstated his characters' comments in his note about Tiresias
 ant main aliot ne sheershak 'da west land ' ko chunaa
 kavita ke liye apane pehle note main ve grel ligand par jessi el weston kii pustak from ritual tu romance ke sheershak ko uttaradaayi maanate hai jisamen fisher king ghayal ho jaataa he or iske parinamswaroop uski dharti banjar ho jaati he
 To fix the king and re-fertilize the land the Grail Quester asks "what's the problem with you"? kavita ko galati se sheershak "west land" diya gaya he 
 However, in a letter to Ezra Pound, Eliot politely stated that the title should begin with "the"
 kavita se pehle da petroniyas ke da setairicon se latin or greek shilaalekh diya gaya he
 In English it is as follows: "" i saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a jar, and when the boys said to her, Sibyl, what do you want? she replied i want to die
 " shilaalekh ke baad ek 'samarpan' diya gaya he, iske anusaar ejra pound ke liye: il miglior fabbro " Here Eliot is both quoting line 117 of Canto XXVI of Dante's Purgatorio, the second cantica of The Divine Comedy, where Dante defines the troubadour Arnaut Daniel as "the best smith of the mother tongue" and also Pound's title of chapter 2 of his The Spirit of Romance where he translated the phrase as "the better craftsman
" yah samarpan mul rup se aliot ke dwaara syaahi se boni or livarit ke sanskaran main likhaa gaya tha, kavita ke is saskaran ko pound ko pesh kiya gaya; baad main iske bhavi sanskarnon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 The five parts of The West Land are titled: kavita ke paathya ke baad kai prishthon ke nots hai, jo iske roopak, sandarbh or sanketon kii vyakhya karte hai
 Some of these commentaries help to explain the poem, but some are controversial and most are opaque prose with no commentary
 in nots ko aliot ke prakaashak ke anurodh ke baad joda gaya, kyonki unke anusaar da west land ko ek alag pustak ke rup main prakashit karnaa uchit tha
 Eliot himself originally wanted a collection of questions about The Waste Land, or he wanted to divide a poem into five sections
 aliot ke kaam kii style naatakeey ekalaap kii sambhaavnaaon ko spasht karti he
 This expression is at least as expressive as J
 Alfred Prufrock's The Love Song

 Interestingly, at the same time that Eliot was writing The Waste Land, Robert Bridges was working on his first neo-miltonic syllabics, the poem was titled 'poor Pool', it also took lines from many different languages
 Were
 jin sroton se aliot ne apane uddhran liye hai yaa jinke kaam ko usne shaamil kiya he ve hai: homer, sophoklass, petroniyas, virgil, ovid, saint augustin of hippo, daante aligheri, wiliam shakespeare, edmund spencer, gerard de narwal, thomas kid, jeffri chausar, thomas middlaton, jon webster, joseph conrad, jon milton, andru maarval, charles baudalere, richard veganar, oliver goldsmith, harman hoshe, alds huxley, paul varlen, walt wheatmen or baram stokar
 aliot ne puranic lekhan kaa bhi kaaphi upyog kiya he, isamen bible, da book of kaaman prere, hindu vrihad aranyak upanishad or buddha kii fire saraman se kai chijen lee gayin hai
 In addition, facts have also been taken from cultural writings such as Sir James Fraser's The Golden Bow and Jesse Weston's From the Ritual to Romance
 aliot ne mul note main likhaa ki "na keval sheershak balki kavita kii yojana or pratikon kaa suzav miss jesi el weston ke dwaara diya gaya tha," lekin- tees saal baad-weston ne kavita ke nots main kai parivartan kiye, usne afsos vyakt kiya
 
 In addition to the West Land, Eliot used many symbols
 inamen fisher king, terro deck, perilas chapel or grel quest ke pratik shaamil hai
 The initial acceptable of the poem was of mixed type; Although many portrayed its universal despair and disgusting technique, others such as FL Lucas examined the first poem, while Charles Powell said it was just "a waste of paper"
 1922 main da dial ke liye edmund wilson kii "da poetry of drawt", ke bare main kai aalochak kehete hai ki kavita main ek prabhavi saranchana he jo bhaavnaatmak tatwon or jeevani ke uddharanon par jor detii he: Not only is life sterile and futile, but men have tasted its sterility and futility a thousand times before TS Eliot, walking the desert of London, feels profoundly that the desert has always been there
 Like Tiresias, he has sat below the wall of Thebes; like Buddha, he has seen the world as an arid conflagration; like the Sibyl, he has known everything and known everything in vain
 daraavnee kavitaaon ke lekhak ech pi lowecraft aliot kii kavita ko "vyaavhaarik rup se muhaavaron, sanketon uddharanon boliyon kaa ek arthhin sangrah bataate hai" or ek nirarthak parody likhte hai: west paper: a poyam of pro found incigniphicans"
 Critic Harold Bloom found that The West Land's pioneer is Alfred Lord Tennison's model: a monodrama
 yah vishesh rup se walt whitemen kii elegi wain lilakas last in da duuryaard bloom'da kii agrani he
 The dominant image of Eliot's poem is found in Whitman's Ode
 aliot kii kavita main "avastavik shahar", apni pratilipi, "priy bhai" or matra vilaap" kaa chithran sadhu ke geet ke rup main kiya gaya he
 One evening, Eliot read a part of the poem for the royal family during World War II, a few years later, the Queen Mother discussed it again: yahan ek shokakul vyakti ek suut main tha or vah ek kavita pard rahaa tha

 "the Burial of the Dead" is the title of the first volume of Eliot and is taken from the Book of Common Prayer, the Church of England Prayer Book
 "da bariyal of da ded" ke duusare khand main shaktiheen meri kii aawaaj sunai detii he jo lekhak kii aawaaj ban jaati he
 The first twelve lines of this volume consist of three Old Testaments and the author finds himself in a summer drought where the land has turned into a desert
 use "san of da main " kaha gaya he, jo hebrew kii bible main aam he, kabhi kabhi yah kisi vyakti arthath kisi vyakti ke putr=maanav ko ingit karata ho, lekin kabhi kabhi ek vishisht aadmi kii or sanket kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye ajekil, jise gold ke dwaara israel ko chetavanee dene ke liye pashchaatap kiya jaataa he
 The same title is also used in the New Testament, primarily Jesus himself using it when he is predicting his death and return, or announcing his decision to come
 ajekil main bhagwaan ant main sant ko bataata he ki israel nahin badalegaa; isliye unke swarup samaapt ho jaayenge, unki chhavi khatm ho jaayegi or unke shahar barbaad ho jaayenge

 Gish expresses these writings with the lines "dead land, broken images, fear and dust, all take on the significance of human failure" After a dismal sequence of events, the author finds shelter under a mysterious "red rock" Which, for the coming Messiah, would be "like a river of water in a dry place, like the shadow of a big rock in a land

 dante bheed main ek kaa vivaran dete hai jise ve jaanate hai, ve likhte hai "maine ek kii chaaya dekhi, jo kaayar tha, jisane inkaar kar diya" 
 The "great denial" to which Dante refers refers to the lack of selection of good or evil

 The job of the opposing team is to somehow catch the ball by hitting, dropping, or catching the ball thrown in the middle, or to prevent the enemy team from moving towards their team's endzone
 america footbaal adhiktar sanyukt rajya america or canada main kheli jaati he
 The name of the institute that governs its sport at a commercial level is the "national Football League", which is called the short form NFL
 america main is khel ke do mukhya rup hai, college footbaal or vyavsaayik footbaal, jinke niyam ek-dusre se thode alag hai
 Football is also played in the higher classes of schools and the rules are also slightly different
 khel kaa maidan 100 gaz lambaa or 53
3 gaz chaudaa hota he
 There is a round streak on both sides of the length of the field, ahead of which there are ten zones of ten Gaz, i
e
 the total length of the field is 120 Gaz
 maidan main har paanch gaz ke faasale par ek yardline naam kii lakeer hoti he
 At the end of every endzone there are two pillars at a height of 10 feet from the ground, which are called "goalposts"
 kisi bhi samay har team maidan main apane 11 khilaadi rakh sakati he, lekin tiimon ko adhikaar hota he ki khel main kisi bhi antaraal ke samay apana ek yaa sabhi khilaadi badal de
 Therefore, football is a specialist sportsman
 kisi bhi team main vastav main bahut se khilaadi hote hai, jinhen teen prakaaron main baanta jaataa he: akramak khilaadi, rakshak khilaadi or vishesh khilaadi 
 Some players are kept in teams only because if a player with their own skills gets hurt, they can be put in their place
 zyaadaatar muqaabalon main kisi bhi team ke kai khilaadiyon ko maidan main utarane kaa mauqaa hi nahin miltaa
 The team that has possession of the ball is called "aggressive" and the one who does not have it is called the "defender"
 akramak team ke sabase mahatvapurn khilaadi ko quarterbaque kehete hai
 When the attacker and the defenders begin to fight, it is their job to quickly review the field and decide which player in the offensive team is in the best position to move the ball towards the guard team's endzone
 phir quarterbaque use gend fank detaa he, yaa khud hi bhagkar gend aage badhaane kii koshish karata he
 The entire time of the game is one hour, which is divided into four 15 minute squares
 duusari chauthai ke baad ek 12 minute kaa viraam hota he
 The ball stops several times while playing and then the playing clock is also stopped
 is se 15 minute kii chauthai vastav main 45 minute se bhi adhik le sakati he or puraa ek ghante kaa khel vastav main teen ghante se bhi zyaada chal saktaa he
 Broadcasters show commercials at these intervals when the game airs on television
 muqaabale kii shuruyaat main sikaa uchhaala jaataa he or ek team ko aakraamak team ghoshit kar ke unhen gend de di jaati he
 Now, on a 50 ghz streak, both teams stand face-to-face to face each other
 aakraamak team kaa quarterbaque apni team ke peeche khadaa hota he
 The atmosphere is such that two groups are getting ready for war
 khel shuru hota he jab gend aakraamak quarterbaque ke haathon main pahunchati he
 Immediately, the players of the defending team reach him and are stubbornly trying to demolish him
 kuch aakraamak khilaadi unase bhidakar unhen rokane kii koshish karte hai, jabaki baaqi akramak khilaadi virdohi ke kshetra main daakhil hokar apane aap ko gend aage badhaane ke liye acchhee sthiti main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 The quarterback has a few moments in which to decide: which partner to throw the ball or to find a way to run away
 kuch hi kshanon main uski raksha karne vaale ginati ke akramak khilaadiyon ko unase jujhane vaale rakshak khilaadi patakekar yaa dhakelkar quarterbaque tak pahunch jate hai
 If the ball is in the hands of the quarterback and is nabbed, it is called a "sac" and is considered very embarrassing for any quarterback
 adhik baar sac hone kaa matlab he kii quarterbaque jhadpon ke bich soch nahin paaya: vah kamazor he or aakraamakon kaa netritv karne ke qaabil nahin he
 Regardless of whether the quarterback throws the ball to someone, he himself grows it, usually the defenders take the offensive player with the ball at a short distance and the ball stops
 is sthiti ko down kehete hai
 The aggressors' job is to raise the ball at least 10 yards in 4 downs
 agar ve aisa nahin kar pate to rakshakon ko gend par qabza de diya jaataa he or rakshak ab aakraamak banate hai or aakraamak rakshak
 The possession of the ball also changes if the ball is missed by an offensive hand and a keeper catches the moving ball or the quarterback throws the ball to another offensive player and a keeper comes in the middle
 fambal yaa interspshan kii sthiti main jis rakshak ne gend pakad liya he vah virdohi ke oundzon kii taraf foran bhaagna shuru kar saktaa he or tab tak bhaag saktaa he jab tak use giraakar daboch na liye jaae, maidan se baahar na dhakel diya jaae, yaa vah oundzon main pahunchakar apane team ke liye ank hi na bana le
 When the ball stops, it is carefully measured at which gazza it is in the 100 Gaz field
 aglaa khel maidan ke bich main usee gaz par shuru kiya jaataa he
 This place is called the "streak of confrontation"
 jaisaa kii kaha gaya he, aakraamak team kaa yahi maqasad he ki chaar yaa us se kam dounon main gend 10 gaz aage bade
 Suppose they put the ball forward 10 yards in two downs
 to kaha jaataa he ki ve phir se pehle down par hai or unhen ab is nai scrimmege lakeer se phir se chaar dounon main gend ko 10 gaz badhanaa he
 This cycle continues until the offensive defenders reach the endzone or accidentally give the opponent possession of the ball
 qabza badalane par jo khel main rukaav hota he, usamen khilaadi bhi badal die jate hai
 Many aggressive players are adept at running and catching a thrown ball and often have light bodies
 bahut se rakshak bhimkaay hote hai or agar ve daboch len yaa patake den to zyaadaatar aakraamak-vishesh khilaadiyon ke liye uthaanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 a good aggressor is one who knows how to catch the ball thrown by the quarterback without making a mistake, and who can dodge the runaway defenders and extend the ball far into enemy territory
 kuch aakraamakon kaa kaam hota he ki ve rakshakon se bhiden taaki anya aakraamak gend aage le ja saken
 Their name itself is "offensive Tackle"

 kawalam madhav panikkar bharat ke vidwaan, patrkaar, itihaaskaar, prashaasak tathaa rajanyajna the
 He is more famous by the name of Sardar KM Panikkar
 bharat ke aadhunik rajanyagnon main sardaar ke0em0 panikkar ke naam kaa ullekh avashya kiya jaataa he
 Panikkar was India's ambassador to China for a long time
 unka maananaa tha ki rajnay kaa janm europe main aadhunik rajyon ke janm se sambandhit he
 Defining diplomacy, Panikkar said, "diplomacy used in international politics is an art of keeping our interests ahead of other countries
 “ rajnay ek kala he jise apanaakar vishwa ke rajya apane parsparik sambandhon ko badhaate hue apane hit sadhana karte hai
 According to Panikkar, diplomacy is "the eyes and ears of one country located in another country
" “ koi bhi desh apane rajanyagnon ke madhyam se duusare desh kii ghatnaon, nitiyon or drushtikon ke bare main jaankaree praapt kar apni videsh niti ko aavashyak mode detaa rahata he
 Many thinkers have considered tact, skill, treachery etc
 as diplomatic virtues, whereas according to Panikkar, full diplomacy is motivated by a view to achieve good wishes of other countries towards their country, and the path of deceit etc
 Is a dangerous instrument
 duusare desh kii shubhakamanaa, prapti ke lakshya kii purti chaar prakaar se adhik acchhee tarah ho sakati he-duusare desh us desh kii nitiyon ko thik prakaar se samajhen or uske prati sammaan kii bhaavana rakhen, vah desh duusare deshon kii janata ke nyyochit hiton ko samajhe evam sarvopari maane tathaa vah eemaandaaree se vyavhaar kare
 You cannot deceive many people forever
 jab desh kii niti kii asaliyat jaahir ho jaayegi to vishwa-samaaj main us desh ke str ko dhakka pahonchega
 Panikkar believes that honesty is the best policy in international life as in personal life
 panikkar ne rajya ke prati swamibhakti ko ek rajanyajna kaa aavashyak gun mana he
 In his words, "the ambassador has to implement the policy that determines his government
" ye uske swayan ke paramarshon se bhinn ho sakati he kyonki kisi desh kii sarkaar hi puri sthiti se parichit hoti he jabaki rajdoot keval apane vishisht lakshyon ko hi jaanata he
 Therefore, when he has to execute instructions which are fundamentally against his views, he should not be influenced by emotion, partiality or friendship and in any case he should not reveal it even by flicking his eyes to the concerned government
 It is necessary that his own views are not different
 adarsh rajdoot ko kisi bhi paristhiti main apane desh se aae kade nirdeshon ko mridu banaakar apni sarkaar ke vyavhaar kaa galat anumaan nahin dena chaiye bhale hi uske desh kii videsh niti sweekaari rajya ko pasand na ho
 Panikkar, who was himself a successful diplomat, considers women's connection and contact helpful to diplomacy
 san 1926 main francisi rajdoot jules camban ne, ek lekh main likhaa tha ki sammanneey striyon kaa sansarg rajdoot ke liye laabhadaayak hoga
 Renowned Indian scholar Chanakya was opposed to contact with women of ambassadors

 In the Second World War period, an American sign clerk showed several letters exchanged between Roosevelt and Churchill, falling in love with a Russian migrant girl
 vah ladki vastav main german jasoos thi
 This clerk was sentenced to seven years due to this crime
 panikkar ke anusaar ek adarsh rajdoot ko apni safalataa par garv or asafalataa par niraashaa nahin hona chaiye
 Panikkar has agreed to two basic functions of the ambassador - first, to keep his government informed about the local conditions and policies there
 doosraa apane desh kii videsh-niti ke kriyanvayan ke liye desh se ai aajnaaon kaa safaltaapurvak paalan karnaa
 The responsibility of the success or failure of any ambassador should be on the foreign policy of that country and not on the diplomat, because the ambassador does not form foreign policy, it is the job of his foreign department
 panikkar kaa vichaar he ki vaartaon ke peeche dabaav kaa sabase bhayanak va antim tarika yuddh kaa he

 francisi kranti france ke itihaas kii rajnatik or saamaajik uthal-puthal evam amul parivartan kii avadhi thi jo 1789 se 1799 tak chali
 Later, Napoleon Bonaparte carried this revolution to some degree by the expansion of the French Empire
 kranti ke falswaroop raja ko gaddi se hataa diya gaya, ek ganatantr kii sthapana hui, khooni sangharshon kaa daur chalaa, or antatah nepolian kii taanaashaahee sthapit hui jisase is kranti ke anekon mulyon kaa pashchimi europe main tathaa uske baahar prasar hua
 This revolution changed the direction of modern history
 isse vishwa bhar main nirpeksh rajtantr kaa hraas hona shuru hua, naye ganatantr ev udaar prajatantra bane
 In the modern era, the state revolution of France proved to be the most dramatic and complex in which the Western civilization shook Western civilization
 is kranti ne keval france ko hi nahin apitu samast europe ke jan-jivan ko ast-vyast kar diya
 The French Revolution has been called a milestone in the history of the entire world
 is kranti ne anya europea deshon main bhi swatantrata kii lalak kaayam kii or anya desh bhi rajshahi se mukti ke liye sangharsh karne lage
 This created an atmosphere against monarchy and autocracy in Asian countries, including European nations
 france main nirankush rajtantr tha jo rajtv ke daivi siddhanth par aadhaarit tha
 In this the king had unlimited rights and the king was arbitrary
 lui 14wein ke shasankaal main nirankushta apni paraakaashtha par thi
 He said- "I am the state"
 vah apni icchaanusaar kanoon banaata tha
 He made excessive centralization of power in favor of monarchy
 kootneeti or sainya kaushal se france kaa vistaar kiya
 In this way he made the monarchy a serious profession

 Despite this, the Palace of Versailles remained a center of luxury
 usne kaha ki mere baad pralay hogi
 Louis was the ruler of the 16th on the eve of the revolution
 vah ek akarmanya or ayogy shaasha tha
 He too exhibited demeanor and autocracy
 usne kaha ki "yah cheez isliye kanoonee he ki yah main chahta hum
 "at the time of resignation of one of his ministers, he said - i wish i could resign

 Which was hereditary
 unki bhartee tathaa prashikshan ke koi niyam nahin the or in naukarshahon par bhi niyantran lagane vaali sanstha maujuud nahin thi
 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people
 in utpeedak raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne kranti kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi
 The peasants had to pay many taxes to the state, the church and other zamindars and the feudal tyrants had to bear
 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable
 is tarah 1789 kii francisi kranti, francisi samaaj main asamanta ke viruddh sangharsh thi
 The economic condition of France was in trouble
 rajya diwaliyapan ke kagaar par pahunch gaya tha
 In fact the royal treasury was emptied due to the extravagance of the kings of France and the frequent wars of Louis the 14th

 An excessive amount of the state was spent on the emperor, empress and his family
 varsay kaa rajmahal rajkosh ke lutpaat kaa saadhan bana tha
 On the other hand the tax system was unsatisfactory
 visheshadhikaron ke kaaran sampann varg kar se mukt tha tathaa garib kisaan jo aarthik drushti se vipann tha, ekmaatr karadaata tha
 In this way the state of the treasury had become extremely thoughtful
 sarkaar france main aay ke anusaar vyay karne ke bajaay vyay ke anusaar aay ko nishchit karti thi
 The state was burdened with debt
 mul dhan kii to baat hi kya france byaaj chukaane main asamarth tha arthath rajya divaaliepan kii sthiti main pahunch gaya tha
 The country's economic malpractices could be improved by encouraging trade commerce, but the government's commercial policy was so uncontrolled and flawed that it did not make possible the development of production and trade in the state
