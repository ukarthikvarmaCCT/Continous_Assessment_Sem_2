 One day, Kamalaprasad takes Poorna away from the city to his garden
 vahaan purna par balaatkaar karne kii koshish karata he, to purna uske chehre par kursi de-markar bhaag jaati he, kamalaprasad bureetarah chot khaakar gir padataa he
 Poorna runs away to Amritrai's shelter and finds shelter in Vanita Bhavan
 purna ke kaaran kamalaprasad kii jagahansai hoti he or vah puri tarah badal jaataa he
 Here, Dananad also regrets his actions that he used to oppose Amritrai after coming to talk of the evil like Kamalaprasad
 ve amritraay se kshamaa maangate hai or amritraay to sahrday hai, ve bhi mitrataa kaa haath aage badhaate hai
 Prema is very happy with the reunion of the two friends and adopts Dannadh with all her heart

 That building is not only an ashram for widows, but also their training, it is the sale of things made by widows and this gives them a sense of self-reliance

 Mountain plain island anya vyaktiyon ke liye harbart spencer dekhen
 Herbert Spencer was an English philosopher, zoologist, sociologist and famous traditional liberal political theorist of the Victorian period

 During his lifetime he gained immense dominance, especially among the English-speaking academic community
 In 1902, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature
 In fact, in the United Kingdom and the United States "there was a time when Spencer's disciples could not even compare him to Aristotle!" ve "sarvshereshth kii uttarjivita " kii avadharana prastut karne ke liye sabase zyada jane jate hai, jo ki unhone charles darwin kii on da origin of spisis padhane ke baad principles of biology main prastut kii thi
 This terminology strongly suggests natural selection, but even when Spencer expanded origins into the fields of sociology and ethics, he also used Lemarkism
 wiliam jorge spencer ke putr harbart spencer kaa janm 27 april 1820 ko darbi, england main hua tha
 Spencer's father was a religious dissenter, whose leanings varied from Methodism to Quakerism, and it appeared that he transmitted all forms of power to his son
 ve johaan henrich pastalozi kii vikasparak shiksha vidhiyon ke anusaar sthapit ek vidhyalay chalaaya karte the or darbi philasofical socity ke sachiv ke rup main bhi kaary kiya karte the, jo ki san 1790 ke dashak main arasmus darwin, charles ke dada, dwaara sthapit ek vaigyanik sanstha thi
 Spencer received experimental science education from his father, while members of the Derby Philosophical Society introduced him to pre-darwinian concepts of biological-origin, notably Erasmus Darwin and jean-baptiste Lamarck
 His uncle, the Reverend Thomas Spencer, pastor of the Hinton Charterhouse near Bath, completed his limited formal education by teaching Spencer some mathematics and physics, and a little Latin, which enabled him to translate simple texts
 Granted Thomas Spencer also left an impression on his nephew of his own firm free-trade and anti-statist political outlook
 Otherwise, Spencer was an educator who gained most of his knowledge from micro-focused studies and conversations with his friends and colleagues
 ek kishor or yuva purush donon ke rup main, spencer ne kisi bhi bauddhik yaa vyavsaayik kshetra main sthir hone main kathinaayee mahasoos kii

 From 1848 to 1853, he served as assistant-editor of the free-trade magazine The Economist, during which he published his first book, Social Statistics, which predicted that humanity would eventually find the necessities of social life According to it will be completely adopted and consequently the concept of the state will be destroyed

 Spencer himself introduced biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, who later became known as 'darwin's Bulldog' and remained his friend for a lifetime
 However, his friendship with Evans and Lewis led him to John Stuart Mill's a System of Logic and Auguste Comte's positivism and this led him on the path of his career
 He completely disagreed with Comte
 ivance or levis se unki mitra kaa pehla pratifal spencer kii agali pustak, san 1855 main prakashit principles of psychology, thi, jisamen manovigyaan ke liye ek shaareerik aadhaar kii khoj kii gai thi
 This book was based on these basic beliefs that the human mind works according to natural laws and that these could be discovered within the framework of general biology

 Spencer argued that both of these theories were partial descriptions of truth: repetitive associations of ideas involved the creation of specific fibers in brain tissue, and that they be passed from one generation to the other through the Lamarckian methodology of experiment-succession

 manovigyaan main spencer kii ruchi prakritik niyam kii saarvbhaumikta ko sthapit karne kii ek adhik buniyadi chintaa se vyutpann thi
 Like others of his generation, including members of Chapman's seminar, he was obsessed with the idea of demonstrating that everything in the universe — including human culture, language, and impermanence — was interpreted by the laws of universal validity
 Could be done
 yah us samay ke anek dharamshasreiyon ke drushtikon ke vipareet tha, jinhone is baat par jor diya ki rachana ke kuch bhaag, vishishtatah maanav aatma, vaigyanik anusandhan ke kshetra se baahar the
 Comte's System de Philosophy was written with the goal of demonstrating the universality of positive natural law, and Spencer had to follow Comte to accomplish his goal
 haalanki, spencer comte ke is vishwaas se sahamat nahin the ki saarvbhaumik anuprayog kaa ek niyam dhund paanaa sambhav tha, jise unhone pragatisheel vikaas main dhundha or utpatti kaa siddhant kaha
 In 1858, Spencer created an outline, which later became the system of artificial philosophy
 This huge work, with only a small number of compositions in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the theory of origins applied to biology, psychology, sociology, and impermanence
 spencer kaa vichaar tha ki das khandon kii is rachana ko purna hone main bees varsh lagenge; ant main unhen isse duguna samay laga or isane unke lambey jivan kii lagbhag puri avadhi le lee
 Despite Spencer's early struggle to establish himself as a writer, by the 1870s he had become one of the most famous philosophers of his time

 Through such contacts, Spencer had a strong presence in the heart of the scientific community and was able to create an effective audience for his approach
 In spite of his increasing wealth and fame, he never owned his own house
 spencer ke jivan ke antim dashak badhate mohabhang or akelepan se bhare hue the
 He never married and after 1855, he became an incessant diseased and constantly complained of pain and diseases, which was not diagnosed by any doctor

 In his last years, his political views became conservative
 haalanki soshal statics ek aise multah prajatantravaadi kii rachana thi, jo mahilaon ko matdaan kaa adhikaar diye jane main tathaa samantshahi kii shakti ko todane ke liye bhoomi ke rashtriyakaran main vishwaas rakhata tha, lekin san 1880 ke dashak tak aate-aate ve mahila matadhikaar ke kattar virdohi ban chuke the or unhone liberty and property difens lig ke bhu-swaamiyon ke saath milakar ek saajha kaarykram main uske khilaaf yogadan kiya, jise ve wiliam ewart gladstone ke netritv main tatwon kaa 'samaajwaad' kii ore jhukaav maanate the-mukhyatah swayan gladstone kii raay ke khilaaf

 An exception to Spencer's growing conservative tendency was that for a lifetime he remained a staunch opponent of militarism and imperialism
 His criticism of the Boer War was particularly damaging and contributed to his diminishing popularity in Britain
 spencer ne aadhunik paper clip ke ek purvavarti kaa avishkaar bhi kiya, haalanki yah aadhunik cotter pin kii tarah adhik dikhaai detaa tha
 This "binding pin" was distributed by Ackerman & Company
 After Appendix i of his autobiography) Spencer displays a picture of this pin as well as a published description of its experiments
 san 1902 main, apni mrityu se kuch samay purv, spencer ko sahitya ke nobel puraskaar ke liye namit kiya gaya
 unhone aaajeevan lekhan-kaary jari rakhaa, apane jivan ke antim varshon main aksar shrutlekh ke dwaara, jab tak ki 83 varsh kii aayu main ve aswasthta se parrast nahin ho gaye

 The basis for Spencer's attraction to many people of his generation was that he seemed to present a pre-constructed system of belief that could replace traditional religious beliefs at a time when Orthodox opinion In front of the advancement of modern science, they were broken apart
 spencer kii darshanik pranali yah darshaati hui prathit hoti thi ki unnat vaigyanik avadharanaon, jaise ushmagatiki ke pratham niyam or jaivik utpatti, ke aadhaar par maanavtaa kii antim purnataa par vishwaas kar paanaa sambhav tha
 In short, Spencer's philosophical approach consisted of a combination of deism and positivism
 ek ore, unhone apane pita tathaa darbi philasofical socity ke anya sadasyon se va jorge combay kii atyadhik lokapriy da constitution of main jaisi pustakon se atharahavin sadi ke devvaad kaa kuch ansh grahan kiya tha
 In this, the universe was considered a cosmic harmony and the laws of nature were 'mercifully kind'
 is prakaar prakritik niyam susanchalit brahmad kii pratimaayein thim, jinhen srishtikarta dwaara maanviya prasannataa ko prachaarit karne ke uddeshy se nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Although Spencer renounced his Christian faith as a teenager and later rejected any 'anthropomorphic' concept of divinity, he nevertheless firmly held the concept at an almost subconscious level
 haalanki ve pratyakshvaad ko jitna shrey dete, ve usase bahut adhik grahan kar chuke the, vishesh rup se vaigyanik gyaan kii vibhinn shakhaon ke ekikaran ke rup main ek darshanik pranali ke iske nirmaan main

 This tension between positivism and the rest of their Devism remained throughout the system of artificial philosophy
 vaigyanik satya ke ekikaran ke lakshya main spencer ne comte kaa anusaran kiya; isi arth main unka darshanashasre 'kritrim' hone par kendrit tha
 Like Comte, he was also committed to the universality of natural law, according to which the laws of nature apply as much to the biological field, without exception, as much as to the inert field and to the human mind
 As much as the rest of the universe
 Thus, the first purpose of artificial philosophy was to demonstrate that as natural laws, there is no exception to be able to discover scientific exploration of all the facts of the universe
 jeev-vigyaan, manovigyaan or samajashasre par spencer dwaara likhe gaye sabhi granthon kaa uddeshy in vishisht kshetron main prakritik niyamon ke astitv ko pradarshit karnaa hi tha
 Even in his writings on morality, he held the view that it was possible to find the 'rules' of impermanence, which, despite having normative content, whose state was only the laws of nature, is a concept whose origin Can be seen in Coombe's Constitution of Man
 kritrim darshanashasre kaa doosraa uddeshy yah darshana tha ki yahi niyam anwarat rup se vikaas kii ore le jate hai
 Unlike Comte, who emphasized only the unity of scientific method, Spencer attempted to unify scientific knowledge by decomposing all natural laws into one basic law, the law of origin
 is sandarbh main, unhone edinburgh ke prakaashak robert chembers dwaara unki anaam rachana vestiges of natural history of kriyeshan main prastaavit kiye gaye pratimaan kaa paalan kiya
 Although often dismissed as an ineffective precursor of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, Chambers' book was actually a program for the integration of science, with the aim of demonstrating that Laplace's origins in the Solar System Both the nebula concept and Lemark's theory of species conversion exemplify 'an amazing generalization of progressive development' It was a battle
 chembers chapman kii sangoshtee se jude hue the or unka kaary kritrim darshanashasre ke liye ek anbhigyaat sancha bana
 The clearest expression of Spencer's evolutionary approach was first articulated in his essay, 'progress: Its Law and Cause', which was published in 1857 in Chapman's Westminster Review and later the basis of the First Principles of a New System of Philosophy
 Made up
 In it, he explained the theory of evolution, combining information from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's essay 'the Theory of Life' —which itself was derived from Friedrich von Schelling's Naturephilosophy — and generalizing von Baer's law of embryonic development i went
 spencer ne yah vichaar vyakt kiya ki brahmad kii sabhi sanrachanaayen ek saral, samaan, samarupata se ek jatil, bhinn, vividhta main viksit hote hai or vibhinn bhaagon ke bade ekikaran kii prakriya bhi iske saath hi chalati rahati he
 Spencer believed that this evolutionary process could be seen working across the universe
 yah ek saarvbhaumik niyam tha, jo ki taron or akashgangaon par bhi utana hi lagu hota tha, jitna ki jaivik praaniyon par or maanviya saamaajik vyavastha par bhi utana hi lagu hota tha, jitna kii maanav-man par
 yah keval apni vyapak saamanyata ke dwaara hi vaigyanik niyamon se bhinn tha or is siddhant ke udhaaharan ke rup main vishesh vigyaan ke niyam pradarshit kiye ja sakate the
 This attempt to explain the development of complexity was completely different from the one found in Darwin's Origin of Species published two years later
 aksar kaaphi, galat tareeke se, yah mana jaataa he ki spencer ne prakritik chayan par darwin dwaara kiye gaye kaary ko keval hathiyaa liya or samanyikrut kar diya
 lekin, bhale hi darwin ke kaary ko padhane ke baad unhone darwin kii avadharana ke liye apni swayan kii shabdaawalee ke rup main vaakyansh 'sarvshereshth kii uttarjivita ' ko prastut kiya or aksar galat tareeke se unhen ek aisa vichaarak maan liya jaataa he, jisane darvinian siddhant ko samaaj par keval lagu kiya, lekin phir bhi unhone apane sampurna maujuuda tantra main prakritik chayan ko anichhaa se hi shaamil kiya tha
 His primary method of species conversion was the Lamarckist experiment-succession, which posited that organs develop or perish through organ use or application, and that these resulting changes can be transmitted to future generations as well
 spencer kaa maananaa tha ki kramik vikaas kii yah kaary-vidhi 'ucchtar' kramik vikaas kii vyakhya karne ke liye bhi aavashyak thi, visheshtah maanavtaa ke saamaajik vikaas ke liye
 iske alaava, darwin ke vipareet, unka maananaa tha ki kramik vikaas kii ek disha or ek antim-bindu tha, jo ki samatulyata kii prapti kii antim avasthaa he
 He attempted to apply the theory of biological evolution to sociology
 unhone pratipaadit kiya ki samaaj nimnatar se ucchtar roopon main parivartan kaa parinaam he, thik vaise hi jaise yah kaha jaataa he ki jaivik kramik vikaas ke siddhant ke anusaar jivan ke nimnatam rup uchachat roopon main viksit hote hai
 Spencer claimed that the human mind had evolved gradually from the simple automatic reactions of lower animals to the process of reasoning in thoughtful humans
 spencer ke anusaar gyaan ke do prakaar the: vyakti dwaara praapt kiya gaya gyaan tathaa prajati dwaara praapt kiya gaya gyaan
 antargyaan, yaa achetan rup se siikhaa gaya gyaan, prajati kaa vanshaagat anubhav tha
 Spencer studied the original positivist sociology of Auguste Comte with great enthusiasm
 vigyaan ke ek darshanik, comte ne saamaajik-saanskrithik kramik vikaas kaa ek siddhant pratipaadit kiya tha, jiske anusaar samaaj kaa vikaas teen charnon ke ek saamaanya niyam ke dwaara hota he
 However, writing after various changes in biology, Spencer attempted to reconstruct social science in the context of evolutionary biology, rejecting the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism
 mote taur par spencer ke samajashasre kaa varnan saamaajik taur par darvinvaadee ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he 
 Spencer argued that the development of society is an example of the gradual development from simple, equal, homogeneity to complex, different, diversity
 unhone samaaj ke do prakaaron, aatankwaadi tathaa audyogic, kaa ek siddhant viksit kiya, jo ki kramik vikasvaadi pragati ke anuroop tha
 The militant society, whose structure consisted of hierarchical and obedient relations, was simple and uniform; Industrial society, which was based on voluntary, contractually accepted social obligations, was complex and varied
 samaaj, jise spencer ne ek 'saamaajik praani' mana tha, kramik vikaas ke saarvbhaumik niyam ke anusaar saraltar avasthaa se adhik jatil avasthaa main kramik rup se viksit hua
 Furthermore, industrial society was a direct descendant of the ideal society developed in social statistics, although Spencer no longer explicitly expressed whether society would result in anarchism or whether it would have informed a continued role of the state
 Is, however, a role that would have been limited to the minimum functions of enforcement of contracts and external security
 haalanki spencer ne praarambhik samajashasre main kuch moolyawaan yogadan diye, jo ki sanrachanaatmak vyaavhaarikta par unke prabhaav se kam nahin the, lekin saamaajik vigyaan ke kshetra main lemarkwaadi yaa darvinian vichaaron ko prastut karne kaa unka prayaas vifal rahaa
 yahaan tak ki kuch logon ne to ise sakriy rup se khatarnaak bhi mana
 us samay ke vyakhyavaadi, jaise wilhem dilthi, prakritik vigyaanon or maanviya vigyaanon ke bich vibhed ke pravartak bane
 san 1890 ke dashak main, emil darkhim ne aupchaarik academik samajashasre kii sthapana kii, jisamen vyaavhaarik saamaajik anusandhan par dridhtaapurvak bal diya gaya tha
 At the turn of the twentieth century, the first generation of German sociologists, most notably Max Weber, introduced heterodox indirectism
 jaisaa ki spencer kii pehali pustak main purvanumaan kiya gaya he, 'adarsh samaaj main adarsh manushya' kaa nirmaan kramik vikaas kii prakriya kaa antim bindu hoga, jisamen manushya saamaajik jivan ko puri tarah apana chuke honge
 is prakriya ke sandarbh main spencer kii shuruaati or baad vaali avadharanaon ke bich mukhya antar inamen shaamil kramik vikaas kaa samay-maap tha
 The psychological - and hence also moral - structure that has been inherited by our ancestors to the present generation, and which we will pass on to our future generations, was in the process of progressively adopting the needs of residence in society
 udhaaharan ke liye, aakraamakata uttarjivita se judaa ek antargyaan tha, jo jivan kii praathmik sthitiyon ko aavashyak tha, lekin unnat samaajon main ise apnaanaa anaavashyak ho gaya
 chunki maanviya antargyaan kaa mastishk ke utakon ke reshon main vishisht sthaan tha, atah vah prayog-uttaradhikaar kii lemarkwaadi kriyavidhi ke adheen tha, taaki kramik parivartan bhavi pidiyon main sthanantarit kiye ja saken
 anek pidiyon ke bitne ke saath hi, kramik vikaas kii prakriya yah sunishchit karegi ki manushya kam aakraamak or vriddhishil rup se parahitvaadi bane, jiske parinamswaroop antat ek sampurna samaaj kaa nirmaan hoga, jisamen koi bhi vyakti kisi anya vyakti ko dukh nahin pahunchayegaa
 However, in order to build a complete person through gradual development, it was necessary that present and future generations experience the 'natural' consequences of their behavior
 Only in this way will individuals get the necessary motivation to do the work of self-improvement and thus provide an advanced moral formation to their heirs
 Therefore, anything that creates a disruption between the 'natural' relationship of behavior and its consequences must be stopped and this includes the exercise of the state's deterrent power to eradicate poverty, provide public education, or mandate compulsory vaccination
 haalanki, dharmarth daan ko protsaahit kiya janaa tha, lekin use bhi is vichaar ke dwaara simit kiya janaa tha ki manushyon ko dukh aksar unke kaaryon ke parinamswaroop hi praapt hote hai
 Hence, excessive altruism directed towards the 'unqualified poor' of individuals would break the link between behavior and consequences, which Spencer believed to be the basic requirement to ensure that the gradual development of humanity continues at a higher level of development
 spencer ne antim mulya kaa ek upyogvaadi maanak apanaaya-sarvaadhik sankhya kii sarvaadhik prasannataa-or unke anusaar kramik vikaas kii prakriya kaa charambindu upyogita kaa mahattam moolyankan hoga
 adarsh samaaj main rahane vaale vyakti na keval paryaaywad ke abhyaas se anand praapt karenge, balki ve dusron ko dukh pahunchane se bachane kaa bhi prayaas karenge
 ve sahaj rup se dusron ke adhikaron kaa sammaan bhi karenge, jiske parinamswaroop nyaay ke siddhant kaa vaishvik str par paalan kiya jayega-prayek vyakti ke paas swatantraaa kii vah adhiktam maatra hogi, jo dusron ko praapt swatantraaa kii samaan maatra ke saath susangat ho
 'swatantraaa' se aashay avapeedan kii anupasthiti se tha or yah nijee sampatti ke adhikaar se gaharaai se judi hui thi
 Spencer called this law of conduct 'ultimate ethics', which provided a scientifically grounded system of ethics that would replace the supernatural-based ethics systems of the past
 However, he recognized that the moral formation we inherited does not yet allow us to deal in full conformity with the laws of ultimate ethics and that is why we need a rule of 'relative ethics' In which the distortive factors of our present imperfection have also been considered
 sangieshasre par spencer kaa vishisht drushtikon bhi unke nitishasre se judaa hua tha
 Spencer thought that the origins of music can be traced to the eloquent oratory
 vaktaa pratyayakari prabhaav daalate hai, na keval unke shabdon kii tarkshiltaa ke dwaara, balki unke lahaze or swaraghaat ke dwaara bhi-jaisaa ki spencer ne ise vyakt kiya, unke swar ke sangitamay gun "buddhi ke vaakyon par bhaawanaaon kii tippanee" ke rup main kaary karte hai
 Music, considered to be an advanced development of his characteristic of oratory, contributes to the education and development of ethics of the species
 "hamaare bheetar dhun or lay se prabhavit hone kii jo vicitra kshamta he, main shaayad ye donon baaten nihit hai ki un ativ prasantaaon kaa ahsaas kar paanaa hamaare swabhaav kii sambhaavnaaon ke bheetar he, tathaa yah ki kisi na kisi tareeke se ve unki prastuti se sambandhit hai
 If so, the power and meaning of music become perceptible; But otherwise they are a mystery
 " In Spencer's final years his initial optimism appeared to be eroding and was replaced by a pessimism about the future of humans
 iske baavjood, unhone apana adhiktam prayaas apane tarkon kaa samarthan karne or gaiyr-hastkshep ke unke mahatvapurn siddhant kii galat-vyakhya ko rokane hetu samarpit kar diya
 Spencer's reputation among the Victorians is largely attributed to his agnosticism

 Spencer argued that whether we start with religious belief or with science, eventually we have to accept some essential, but literally unthinkable assumptions
 chaahe ham kisi nirmaataa ke prati chintit hon yaa us adhbstar ke prati, jo tathyon ke hamaare anubhav ke neeche sthit he, ham isaki sankalpana kaa koi khaakaa nahin khinch sakate
 spencer kaa nishkarsh tha ki isiliye, dharm or vigyaan is param satya ko sweekaar karte hai ki maanviya samaj keval 'saapeksh' gyaan ko samaj paane main hi sakasham he
 This is because, due to the inherent limitations of the human mind, it is only possible to gain knowledge of the facts, not the reality below the facts
 Therefore, both science and religion should accept that 'of all the facts, it is most certain that the power we see in the universe, and is completely inaccessible
 ' ise unhone 'agyeya' kaa bodh kaha or unhone agyeya kii upasna ko paaramparik dharm kaa sthaan lene main sakasham sakaaratmak vishwaas ke rup main prastut kiya

 The expression 'there is no alternative', which was brought to prominence by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, can be traced to its strenuous use by Spencer

 Spencer is sometimes credited with the Social Darwinist model applied to the law of survival of the best of society

 According to a review of the JSTOR English-language database, the terminology "social Darwinism" was first used in an English-language academic journal in a book review of 1895 by Frank Tossig, a Harvard economist
 The data of JSTOR suggest that this term was used only 21 times before 1931

 Spencer's ideas became very effective in China and Japan, a big reason being that he attracted the reformers' desire to establish a powerful nation-state that could compete with Western powers
 His ideas were introduced by the Chinese scholar Yen Fu, who felt his writing was a recipe for the reform of the Qing state

 Spencer also had a great influence on literature and oratory
 In his 1852 essay, "the Philosophy of Style", a growing trend of the formist type of writing was discovered

 spencer ne tark diya ki lekhak kaa adarsh "vichaaron ko is prakaar prastut karnaa he, taaki pathak unhen nunatam sambhav maansik prayaas ke dwaara samaj sake
" He argued that by making the meaning as accessible as possible, the writer would achieve the highest possible communicative efficiency
 According to Spencer, this can be done by placing all the clauses, objects and phrases before the subject of a sentence, so that by the time the reader reaches the subject, they have already had all the information necessary to fully understand its significance
 Although the overall impact of "genre philosophy" on the field of oratory was not as widespread as his contributions to other fields, Spencer's tone lent effective support to the metaphorical approaches to oratory

 Hg Wells used Spencer's ideas as the subject of his short novel, The Time Machine, and was applied to explain the gradual evolution of humans as two species
 Perhaps the best example of Spencer's ideas and influence of writing is that his reach was so diverse
 unhone na keval apane samaaj ke aantarik kriyakalapon ko aakaar pradaan karne vaale prashaskon ko prabhavit kiya, balki un samaajon ke aadarshon va vishwaason ko aakaar dene main sahaayta karne vaale kalakaaron ko bhi prabhavit kiya

 tatvamasi tum hi brahm ho; ahan brahmasmi main hi brahm hum; 'ayamatma brahm' yah aatma hi brahm he; in brihadaaranyakopanishad tathaa chaandogopenishad vaakyon ke dwaara is jeevatma ko niraakaar brahm se abhinn sthapit karne kaa praytn shankaracharya ji ne kiya he
 Brahma has been given the reason for the origin, position and destruction of the world
 brahm sat nity, chaitanyaswaroop tathaa anand swaroop he
 They have accepted this
 jeevatma ko bhi sat swaroop, chaitanya swaroop tathaa anand swaroop sweekaar kiya he
 Stating the nature of the world, it is said that - arthath naam evam rup se vyaakrit, anek karta, anek bhokta se sanyukt, jisamen desh, kaal, nimitt or kriyafal bhi niyat hai
 The world whose creation cannot be imagined by the mind, the origin, the position and the rhythm of the world, it is called Brahm
 sampoorn jagat ke jeevon ko brahm ke rup main sweekaar karnaa, tathaa tark aadi ke dwaara uske siddh kar dena, aadi shankaracharya kii visheshta rahi he
 In this way, from the evaluation of Shankaracharya's personality and work, we can say that the task of tying the nation in a sutra was done by Shankaracharya
 bhartiya samskruti ke vistaar main bhi inkaa amuly yogadan rahaa he
 Adi Guru Shankaracharya was born in a village called Kaldi in Kerala
 vah apane brahman mata-pita kii ekmaatr santaan the
 His father died as a child
 shankar kii ruchi armbh se hi sanyas kii taraf thi
 At a young age, after requesting mother to leave for sannyas, he went out in search of Guru
 
 After receiving knowledge from Guru Gobind Paad of Vedanta, he traveled all over the country
 mithila ke pramukh vidwaan mandan mishra ko shastrarth main haraaya
 But Mandan was defeated by Mishra's wife Bharti
 dubaara phir rati vigyaan main paarangat hokar bharti ko parajeet kiya
 He removed the religious evils prevailing in the then India and illuminated the country with the light of Advaita Vedanta
 sanathan dharm kii raksha hetu unhone bharat main chaaron dishaao main chaar mathon kii sthapana kii tathaa shankaracharya pad kii sthapana karke us par apane chaar pramukh shishyon ko asin kiya
 Jyotirmath in the north, Shringeri in the south, Govardhan in the east and Sharda Math in the west established four dhams in the country
 32 saal kii alpaayu main pavitra kedaar nath dham main sharir tyaag diya
 Shankaracharya is known as Adi Guru with respect in the whole country
 ek sanyasi balak, jisaki aayu maatr 7 varsh thi, gurugrih ke niyamanusaar ek brahman ke ghar bhiksha maangane pahunchaa
 There was not even a grain of food in the house of that Brahmin to give alms
 brahman patni ne us balak ke haath par ek aanwala rakhaa or rote hue apni vipannataa kaa varnan kiya
 Seeing his condition, the heart of that love-pity idol child was moved
 vah atyant aart swar main maan lakshmi kaa stotra rachakar us param karunamayi se nirdhan brahman kii vipadaa harne kii prarthana karne laga
 Pleased at his request, Mahalakshmi rained gold amla in the house of that poor poor Brahmin
 jagat janani mahalakshmi ko prasann kar us brahman parivaar kii daridrata dur karne vaala, dakshin ke kaladi gram main janma vah balak tha- ‘'shankar'’, ji aage chalakar '‘jagadguru shankaracharya'’ ke naam se vikhyath hua
 Lord Shankar himself incarnated on this earth in the form of this great scholar Shaktipunj child
 inke pita shivguru nampudri ke yahan vivaah ke kai varshon baad tak jab koi santan nahin hui, tab unhone apni patni vishishtadevi ke saath putr prapti kii kaamana se dirghakaal tak chandramauli bhagwaan shankar kii kathor aradhana kii
 After all, Lord Shankar appeared in a dream and was pleased and said, 'ask for the groom
 ’ shivguru ne apane isht guru se ek dderghaayu sarvajna putr maanga
 Lord Shankar said- 'watts, longevity son will not be omniscient and omniscient son will not have longevity
 bolo tum kaisaa putr chaahate ho?’ tab dharmapraan shastrasevi shivguru ne sarvajna putr kii yachana kii
 Lord Shiva again said - 'watts you will get an omniscient son
 main swayan putr rup main tumhaare yahan avateern hounga
 ' kuch samay ke pashchaat i
 san 686 main baishakh shukla panchami ke din madhyakaal main vishishtadevi ne param prakashrup ati sundar, divya kaantiyukt balak ko janm diya
 Devgn Brahmins reflected the chakra symbol on the forehead of the child, the eye sign on the forehead and the insignia on the wing to represent him as a Shiva avatar and named him 'shankar'
 inhen shankaracharya ji ko prativarsh baishakh shukla panchami ko shradhanjali arpit karne ke liye shri shankaracharya jayanti manaai jaati he
 At the time when Jagadguru Shankaracharya emerged, at that time Vedic religion was melting in Bharata and humanity was dying, in such a situation, Acharya Shankar appeared as Bhaskar Prakash Pillar of human religion
 maatr 32 varsh ke jivan kaal main unhone sanathan dharm ko aisi ojasvi shakti pradaan kii ki uski samast murchha dur ho gai
 Shankaracharya had attained good knowledge of Malayalam at the age of three years
 inke pita chaahate the ki ye sanskrit kaa purna gyaan praapt karen
 But due to the premature death of the father, in the infancy, Shankar's head's shadow rose from Shankar's head and the entire burden fell on Shankar ji's mother's shoulders
 lekin unki mata ne kartavya paalan main kami nahin rakhi
 paanch varsh kii avasthaa main inkaa yagyopavit sanskaar karwaakar vedon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye gurukul bhej diya gaya
 They were rich in talent from the beginning, so their guru was also very surprised by their talent
 apratim pratibha sampann shrutidhar balak shankar ne maatr 2 varsh ke samay main veda, puraana, upanishad, ramayana, mahabharat aadi granth kanthsth kar liye
 After that, after being honored with the Guru, he returned home and started serving Mother
 unki matra shakti itani vilakshan thi ki unki prarthana par alwai nadi, jo unke gaanv se bahut dur bahati thi, apana rukh badal kar kaladi gram ke nikat bahane lagi, jisase unki mata ko nadi snaan main suvidha ho gai
 After some time, his mother thought of his marriage
 par acharya shankar gruhasthi ke jhanjhat se dur rahanaa chaahate the
 An astrologer had also told by looking at the birth chart that at a young age there is the possibility of his death
 aisa jaanakar acharya shankar ke man main sanyas lekar lok-seva kii bhaavana prabal ho gai thi
 He persevered with his mother for retirement and Bal Shankar took retirement at the age of 7
 phir jivan kaa ucchtam lakshya praapt karne ke liye mata se anumati lekar ghar se nikal pade
 One day in the life of Acharya Shankara - Acharya Shankar is versed to reach him in the last moments of Matashree Aryamba's life
 'kaalah krida gachchhatyaayuʼ siddhantanusaar yah kshan udit hota he
 Acharya Shankar gets a foreshadowing from the power of yoga
 chal dete hai ve kerala ke kaalti sthit apane gram kii ore
 As soon as the village enters the border, the storm of memories completely engulfs them
 'are, yahi to alwai nadi he
 i was caught by a crocodile while bathing in it
 matashri se mere sanyas kii anugna milne par hi usne mujhe mukt kiya tha
 There was so much compulsion in his mind while giving permission
 main unka ekmaatr santan
 He is also sanyasom oriented
 vansh shrinkhalaa ke uchhinn hone kii sthiti
 Service of Ekakini Mata- Problem of Sushruva
 phir bhi unhone mujhe sanyas kii anumati di
 'acharya arrives at the door of his house thinking all these things
 acharya kii aahat paakar grihasevika darwaja kholti he 
 Acharya reaches directly to Mother Mathaiya
 sanyasi rup main putr ko dekhakar mata ke netron se ashruvindu dhalakane lagate hai
 In this sequence, the mother's death is done
 matashri ke praan apne sanyasi putr kii utkar pratiksha main hi atake the
 Here eyes see the son, and the second moment Pran gives his body the body of a body with his extraction
 acharya shankar ne sanyas kii diksha lee he, ve parivrajak ho gayi hai
 According to the scriptures, they cannot touch fire
 unke saamne ek bhayankar dharmsankat surasa kii bhaanti munh baaye khadaa ho jaataa he
 If they offer oblation to the mother goddess, then sannyasa is revered by religion
 yadi mukhaagni nahin dete to putr dharm se vimukh hote he
 For some time Acharya's ascetic mind jumped from his mind and runs away
 uske sthaan par saamaanya chitt kaa pravesh ho jaataa he
 Seeing the maternal body, he deviates like a normal human
 matashri ke haathon ko apane haath main lekar ateet main kho jate hai
 Think 'I did so much service with these hands
 aaj ye haath itane paravash ho gayi hai
 In childhood, she used to rub me in the Poorna River with these hands
 khilaate samay saathi bacchon ke saath main khilne ke liye bhaag jaataa tha
 She used to run and catch me and feed with these hands
 inhen haathon se ve pratidin menre sharir par telumardan karti thim
 When Dadashree died, Mothershree wanted to spend the rest of her life with my mind
 par menre sanyasi hone ke pashchaat ve puri tarah se tut gayin
 In my absence, he had only one task left, waiting for death
 'acharya shankar ateet se vartmaan main utarate hai
 At the same time, the housekeeper whispers in his ear, 'your Namboodri family will not participate in the funeral procession of the mother
 unke asahyog kaa kaaran yah he ki ve aapke is krity ko shaastra viruddh or parampara viruddh maanate hai
 It is said that when a sannyasi gives up his home, it is against the scripture to return to his home principal
 agni sparsh uske liye sarvatha varjit he
 We cannot support Acharya Shankar in working against such scriptures
 sevika kii baat sunakar acharya ek kshan ke liye udign ho jate hai
 They do not understand how they will go to the crematorium with the dead body of mother alone
 kuch samay ke liye ve kinkartavyavimudh ho jate hai
 Suddenly a solution flashes in his mind
 'matashri ke shav ko shmashaan ghat par na le jaakar yadi grih parisar main hi antyeshti kar di jaay to isamen kya aapatti ho sakati he
 ʼ Some such feeling comes in the mind of Acharya
 sagotri log dur se hi acharya kii dwividha kaa anand le rahe hai
 No one supports them in these moments of disaster
 antatah acharya shankar apane ghar ke saamne hi chita sajaate hai
 Somehow the body of the mother is placed on the pyre
 haath main agnishikha lekar chita kii parikrama karte hue shav ko mukhaagni dete hai
 Acharya converts the house premises into a crematorium
 chita se uthi lapaton ko dekhakar acharya ko lagata he jaise agni dev unki mata ke sookshm sharir ko lekar pitralok kii ore prayaag kar rahe hai
 Gradually the flames of the pyre calm down but the mind of the Acharya gets upset for his relatives
 sochate hai, itani baari vipattiyon me hamaare sagotriyo ne sahanubhuti kaa ek shabd bhi muh se nahin nikaala
 This mentality of Acharya Shankar leads to a curse, "now the people of this gotra will not cremate the crematorium like me, but in front of their house
 " 'mrisha na hoi dev rishi vaani' siddhanth ke anusaar kerala ke kaalti gram main namboodri brahmanon me aaj bhi shav-dah ghar ke saamne hi kiya jaataa he
 After a long trek from Kerala, he reached Omkarnath on the banks of river Narmada
 vahaan guru govindpad se yoga shiksha tathaa advait brahm gyaan praapt karne lage
 Acharya Shankar continued to practice the Advaita element for three years
 tatpashchaat guru ajna se ve kaashi vishwanath ji ke darshan ke liye nikal pade
 While he was going to Kashi, a Chandal came in his way
 unhone krodhit ho chandal ko vahaan se hat jane ke liye kaha to chandal bolaa- ‘he muni! aap shariron main rahane vaale ek paramatma kii upeksha kar rahe hai, isliye aap abrahman hai
 Therefore, move away from my path
 ’ chandal kii devvani sun acharya shankar ne ati prabhavit hokar kaha-‘aapane mujhe gyaan diya he, at: aap mere guru hue
 Saying this, when Acharya Shankar bowed down to him, he was seen by Shiva and four deities in place of Chandal
 kaashi main kuch din rahane ke dauraan ve mahishmati nagari main acharya mandan mishra se milane gaye
 The domesticated hyena that was home to Acharya Mishra also chanted Veda mantras
 mishra ji ke ghar jaakar acharya shankar ne unhen shastrarth main haraa diya
 Seeing the defeat of her husband Acharya Mishra, wife Acharya said to Shankar - 'mahatmaan! You have just won half a part
 apni yuktiyon se mujhe parajeet karke hi aap vijayi kahala sakenge
 ' tab mishra ji kii patni bharti ne kaamshaastra par prashn karne prarambh kiye
 But Acharya Shankar was a child-celibate, so where would he answer his questions related to work? On this, he asked for a few days time from Bharti Devi and entered into the body and got all the information about that subject
 iske baad acharya shankar ne bharti ko bhi shastrarth main haraa diya
 During his stay in Kashi, he defeated even more learned Pandits in a debate and became famous on the Guru's post
 anek shishyon ne unase diksha grahan kii
 After this, he started promoting religion
 vedant prachaar main sanlagn rahakar unhone anek granthon kii rachana bhi kii
 The Advaita Brahmist Acharya Shankar believed only the uninterrupted Brahman to be true and was immersed in the Brahmana
 ek baar ve brahm muhoort main apane shishyon ke saath ek ati sankri gali se snaan hetu manikarnika ghat ja rahe the
 On the way, a young woman sat mourning her dead husband's head in his lap
 acharya shankar ke shishyon ne us stri se apane pati ke shav ko hataakar rasta dene kii prarthana kii, lekin vah stri use ansuna kar rudan karti rahi
 Then Acharya himself requested him to remove the body
 unka aagrah sunakar vah stri kehane lagi- ‘he sanyasi! aap mujhase baar-baar yah shav hataane ke liye kah rahe hai
 Why don't you ask this dead body to be removed? ' Hearing this, Acharya said- 'O Goddess! You may have also forgotten in mourning that the body itself does not have the power to move away
 ’ stri ne turant uttar diya- ‘mahatman aapaki drushti main to shakti nirpeksh brahm hi jagat kaa karta he
 Then why can't this dead body be removed without power? ' Acharya sat there after hearing such a serious, knowledgeable, mysterious sentence of that woman
 unhen samadhi lag gai
 In the inner eye, he saw - everywhere Adyashakti Mahamaya Leela is mourning
 unka hriday anivarchaneey anand se bhar gaya or mukh se matra vandana kii shabdamayi dhara stotra banakar foot padi
 Now Acharya Shankar became such an ocean in which streams of monotheism, monotheism, pure virtue, specific dualism, devotion to virtuous realization with Nirguna Brahman wisdom started to shake together
 unhone anubhav kiya ki gyaan kii advait bhoomi par jo paramatma nirgun niraakaar brahm he, vahi dwait kii bhoomi par sagun saakaar he
 He considered the worship of Saguna to be the inevitable ladder to reach Nirguna by supporting both Nirguna and Saguna
 gyaan or bhakthi kii milan bhoomi par yah bhi anubhav kiya ki advait gyaan hi sabhi saadhnaaon kii param uplabdhi he
 He also proclaimed 'brahman Satyam Jaganmithya' and also composed devotional hymns of Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh, Vishnu etc
, composed the best texts like 'soundarya Lahiri', 'vivek Chudamani'
 prasthaan trayee ke bhashya bhi likhe
 With his irrefutable arguments ended the duality of shaiva-shakta-vaishnavas and paved the way for Panchdevopasana
 unhone asetu himalay sampurna bharat kii yatra kii or chaar mathon kii sthapana karke puure desh ko saanskrithik, dharmik, darshanik, aadhyatmik tathaa bhugolic ekta ke avichhinn sutara main band diya
 He gave a formula of liberation to all mankind - arthath durjan sajjan bane, sajjan shanti bane
 Be free from peaceful bonds and free other people
 apana prayojan puraa hone baad taintis varsh kii alpaayu main unhone is nashwar deh ko chhod diya
 Shankaracharya was a great ordinationist
 unhen hindu dharm ko punah sthapit evam pratishthit karne kaa shrey diya jaataa he
 On the one hand he reinforced the philosophical basis of Sanatan Hinduism by reviving Advaita thinking, on the other hand he also tried to justify the idolatry prevalent in the masses
 sanathan hindu dharm ko drudh aadhaar pradaan karne ke liye unhone virdohi panth ke mat ko bhi aanshik taur par angikaar kiya

 The first is Saguna Brahma but the second is Nirguna Brahm

 There are very few rulers like Bahadur Shah Zafar who love their country like Mehbooba and succumb to pardes with the promise of not getting a place in ku-i-yaar
 yahi buniyadi farq tha moolbhoot hindustani vichaardhaara ke saath jo apane desh ko apni maan maanate he
 When King Zafar breathed his last while imprisoned in Rangoon, this lion of his own famous ghazal must have been on his lips- "how much is bad luck for Zafar Dawn, two yards of land was not even found in ku-i-yaar 
 " Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor to play an important role in India's first freedom struggle, is also noted as a great poet of Urdu
 unki shaayari bhavuk kavi kii bajaay deshbhakti ke josh se bhari rahati thi or yahi kaaran tha ki unhone angrej shaskaon ko takhte-landan tak hindustan kii shamsheer chalane kii chetavanee di thi
 According to public opinion, when the emperor Zafar was arrested after the first freedom struggle, an English military officer who knew Urdu said this lion while sarcastically saying - "dum dum nahi, now Khair mango ki a jafar is now sheath Is Shamsheer of India 

 !! " On this, Zafar gave a befitting reply and said - "there will be boo in Hindi when the talk of Iman, the planks will go till London

 One of the few orders he gave as soon as he became emperor was to ban cow slaughter
 is aadesh se pataa chalata he ki ve hindu-muslim ekta ke kitne bade pakshdhar the
 According to Dr
 Shailnath Chaturvedi, former Professor of History at Gorakhpur University, during the time of 1857, Bahadur Shah Zafar was such a great personality, who was respected not only as a king but also as a secular person
 isiilie behad swaabhaavik tha ki meerut se vidroh kar jo sainik dilli pahunche unhone sabase pehle bahadur shah jafar ko apana badshaah banaaya
 Chaturvedi said in conversation that making Zafar the emperor was a message to the British rulers symbolically
 iske tahat bhartiya sainik yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki bharat ke kendra dilli main videshi nahin balki bhartiya shaasha kii satta chalegi
 Bahadur Shah Zafar's order to ban cow slaughter after becoming a king was not a new order
 balki akbar ne apane shasankaal main isi tarah kaa aadesh de rakhaa tha
 Zafar had merely started following this order again

 Others Others: The Persian word darvish is of ancient origin and originates from the proto-iranian word that appears in Druzhu through the Middle Persian Driosh in Avestan as drugu- "needy"
 irani shabd shaayad vaidic sanskrit shabd adrigu- ke saath ek sangyeya he, jo kai devataaon par anishchit arth kaa ek pratik he
 The word Vedic is perhaps to be analyzed as a-drigu, it is "not drigu", perhaps "not poor", i
e
 "rich"
 is vaidic sangyeya ke astitv se pataa chalata he ki pavitra mahamari kaa santhaan pracheen bharat-irani logon ke bich pramukh tha kyonki yah aitihaasik rup se baad main iran main ghrunit bhaichaare ke rup main or vibhinn skulon ke rup main bharat main bhi rahaa he jaise sanyasi kaa 
 However, the etymology of the word is not clear from the point of view of modern Persian language, an attempt has been made to make parts of the word understandable in the context of contemporary words and with Sufic mystical concepts
 der shabd 1964 se pehle daar ke rup main vartanee, jiskaa matlab farsi main "darwaja" he; darvesh kaa arth "ek jo daravaaje se daravaaje tak jaataa he" ke rup main vyakhya kiya gaya he
 The Persian word also gives the word for "ascetic" in some languages, such as the Urdu phrase "darveshneh tabiyat", used for "an immutable or ascetic nature"
 bundaahishan darvish yaa darvesh kaa matlab "kai darwaazon tak jane vaala" kaa arth he
 The word is a composition of dar or dar and adjective form and weish or vash ويش or وش vish, and means "someone who goes door to door, sings songs, gets money, and awakens people"
 yah shabd farsi main purana he, lekin yah pashto kii bharat-irani bhashaa main vesh zalmanian yaa zalman he, jiskaa arth he "jaagrit yuva" he
 Many Darvesh are Sufis and have vowed that they will not run towards wealth, poverty is their richness, not like Mullahs
 vinamrata siikhnaa unka mukhya kaaran he, lekin apane swayan ke liye prarthana karne ke liye daraveshon ke liye nishiddh he
 They have to give the collected money to other poor people
 anya aam vyavsaayon main kaam karte hai; misr kaa kadariyaa - turki main qadiri ke rup main jane jate he - udhaaharan ke liye machuaare hai
 Some classical writers indicate that Darvesh's poverty is not merely economic
 udhaaharan ke liye saadi, jo khud ko vyapak rup se ek darvesh ke rup main yatra karte the, or unke bare main bade paimaane par likhaa, unke gulistaan main, kehete hai: What is the benefit of dharna, and third, yaa lapet kar pahane hue kapadon se? apane aap ko se mukt rakhen bure karmon se, yah aapke liye jaruri nahin he khud ko darvesh mahasoos karne pahani topi: ek darvesh kaa khyaal ho dil main, naa ki tatariyon kii topi kaa pahananaa

 Kalil or colloid is a chemical mixture in which one object is uniformly dispersed in another
 parikshepit vastu ke kan mishran me keval nilambit rahete he naa ki ek vilyan kii tarah 
 This is because the size of the particles in the membrane is larger than the size of the particles present in the solution - these particles are so small that they are completely dispersed in the mixture to form a homogenous mixture, but not so large that the light Scour and do not dissolve
 is parikshepan ke chalate kuch kalil vilyan jaise dikhte hai
 a bud system has two distinct phases: the first dispersion phase and the second continuous phase
 ek kalil pranali thos, drav yaa gasiy ho sakati he
 The table below gives a comparative analysis of the diameter of the particles of the plume in a homogenous and uniform mixture
 : Therefore, the collicular suspensions are intermediates for homogenous and homogeneous mixtures
 kalil ke liye angreji main kollid shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The word is derived from the Greek word kola which means 'glue'
 san 1861 i
 main ek angrej vaigyanik, tamas graham, ne dekha ki albumin, sares, gond, maand, silisik amla or isi prakaar ke anya padaarth jal main ghole jane par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se chhanakar nahin nikal pate
 In contrast, hydrolysis of sugars, urea, sodium, chloride, etc
 are released from the pores of the bio-membrane
 purv prakaar ke padaarth adhikansh main acristalia rup main milte hai is gun ke aadhaar par jal main viley padaartho kaa do virgon main vibhaajan kiya gaya: ek ve padaarth, jo crystalia the or jal main vilyan ke pashchaat jaev jhilli ke chhidron se bahirgat ho sakate the, crystalloid kehalaae or duusare ve, jo acristalia the or jal main gholne par jaev jhilli ke chhidron se nikalne main samarth nahin ho sakate the, kalil kehalaae
 But now it has been proved that crystalline substances like sugars and sodium chloride can also be obtained in the appropriate medium in the form of pigments
 kalilavastha main kalil kan ek avichhinn madhyam main bikhare rahete hai
 Thus, there are two components in the buds
 neeche kii suchi main pehla naam madhyam kaa or doosraa naam vitarit padaarth kaa he : The size of the calculus is particularly important
 aakaar main kalilkan anuon se bade hote hai, kintu aise sabhi kanon se, jo sookshmdarshi se dekhe ja sakate hai, ye aakaar main chote rahete hai
 They extend 10–5 cm
 From 10–7 cm Happens till
 yadhyapi upar di gai suchi ke prayek mail ke kalil praapt kiye ja sakate hai, phir bhi or prakaar ke kalil adhik prayukt hote hai or inhen kaa adhyayan bhi adhik vistaarpurvak kiya gaya he
 The solids of the solid or liquid distributed in the medium of water are called Sauls
 carbonic or acarbonic donon prakaar ke padaarth anek roopon main kalilavastha main paae jate hai
 Scientifically or technically, there is hardly any branch in which the buds are not used significantly
 apni isimhatta ke kaaran kalil vigyaan vishesh rup se hota gaya he
 In order to distinguish between the qualities of the Kalils, they have been divided into two major classes
 pehle varg main dhatviya prakaar ke kalil, jaise swarna kalil aadi, hai or duusare varg main protein prakaar ke kalil hai, jaise gelatin aadi
 Their special qualities are as follows: in donon prakaar ke kalilon ke liye jin shabdon kaa vishesh prayog hota he ve hai jalasantrasi or jalpremi 
 They are also called lyophobic and lyophilic in English in order
 yah vargeekaran purnroopen santoshjanak nahin kaha ja saktaa, kyonki katipay kalilon ke kuch gun donon charam virgon ke apokshakrit gunon ke madhyavarti hote hai
 These types of waterways have some metal oxides or hydroxides, some insoluble phosphate, molybdate, tungstate etc
 kuch log kalilon ko alambaabh or pysabh ke do virgon main vibhajit karte hai
 Apart from these, there is also a third category of Kalils which has become particularly important now
 yah varg kalileey vidyudvishleshya kehalaata he
 Soap water is a typical example of this
 in jalakalilon main vidyucchalakata bhi hoti he
 They are now being used more as refinements
 kalilon main atisookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se browneey gati ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Mergers do not have this action
 jab ek twri kiranpath kendrit karke jalakalil ke madhya se bheji jaati he tab kiranpath dugdhabh ho jaataa he or bahirgat kirane dhravatv praapt kar leti hai
 The reasons for this are the similarity in the size and wavelength of light and the uniformity in the wavelength of the distributed matter and the wavelength of the light and the alternation of the opposing material exceeds the mean of the different medium
 shaktishaalee sookshmdarshi kii sahaayta se tindal ke prabhaav dwaara kalilkanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 When viewed in this way, the calculus appears like the illuminated stars
 saath hi inaki gati twri, aniyamit or nirantar hoti he
 This motion is called Brownian motion
 isi gati se padaartho ke gatyaatmakataa-siddhant ke vichaaron kii praayogic pushti hui he
 By extracting the Avogadro constant according to this theory, it has been proved that the values of the Avogadro-constant derived from this method by considering the experimental error are comparable to the values of the constant extracted from other methods
 parin ne mastic gond ke kalil par pariksha karke aavogadro niyatank kaa maan 6
510E23 nikaala he
 The radius of the appropriate mastic glue particles in the experiment was 6
5 x 10–4
 anek pravidhik vidhiyon ke liye kalil nirmit karnaa aavashyak he
 Hydrographic plains can only be made easily, because watertight plots are reversible
 jalasantrasi kalilon ke nirmaan ke liye kai vidhiyaan prayukt hoti hai
 These methods can be divided into two classes - integration and disintegration
 pehali vidhi main aanaviya aakaar ke kanon ko dhire-dhire tab tak badhaayaa jaataa he jab tak ve kalilon kaa aakaar nahin praapt kar lete or unke adhik badhane kii gati kisi sthayitv pradaan karanevaale padaarth kii upasthiti se, athwa kisi jalpremi kalil ke mila dene se, niyantrit kar di jaati he
 By this method many metals, hydroxides, insoluble salts and silver halides used in photography have been made in the bud
 duusari vidhi se bade-bade kanon ko chote-chote kanon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 In the braiding method metal pieces are obtained by breaking large pieces of metals with the help of electric arc
 is kaaran is vidhi ko vighatan kii vidhi kaha jaataa he, kintu vastav main ye kalil bhi ekikaran kii vidhi se hi banate hai
 The metal evaporates at high temperature of the arc
 phir vaashp ke ati sookshm kan ekikrut hokar kalilkanon kaa aakaar praapt kar lete hai
 In fact kalil-mill is the major means of making Kalil by partition
 is yantra main do platen, jo ek duusare ke atyant sameep rahati hai, paraspar vipareet disha main gumti he
 The material to be delivered is sent between these two plates with the appropriate medium
 is prakaar kan chote hokar kalil kanon kaa aakaar grahan kar lete hai
 For the treatment of the buds produced by any of the two methods, they are subjected to a different action by dialysis with a geminal substance
 aisa karne ke liye kalil ko parchament yaa celophen ke jhole main rakhaa jaataa he
 This bag is now kept in pure solvent
 yah vilaayak hi kalil kaa madhyam hota he
 Electrical dialysis can make refinement more complete and faster
 jalpremi kalil atyant sthaayee hote hai or vidyudvishleshya kii laghumatraaon ke prati niskriy hote hai
 Their stability is due to their solubility in the medium
 in kalilkanon kaa bahya tal madhyam ke anuon se dhakaa rahata he
 In this way the free energy of the outer plane is negligible
 isse ye kan aakaar main badhane main asamarth rahete hai
 In addition, it has been observed that water-soluble materials reduce the interstellar stress of the medium
 is prabhaav se bhi kalilon kaa sthayitv niyantrit rahata he
 The stability of the drainage systems is due to the charge located on the tubes
 kalilkanon ke bahya tal par aavesh kaa srijan unke dwaara avashoshit yanon ke kaaran hota he
 The charge at the bottom of the calculus decreases with the addition of an electrolyte, and gradually a situation arises when the bottom of the calculus at the lowest concentration of the electrolyte is unable to resist the forces of integration
 is prakaar vidyudvishleshya kaa vah nimnatam sandran, jo kisi kalil kii ek nishchit maatra ke avakshepan main samarth hota he, kalil kaa avakshepan maan kaha jaataa he
 In general, the higher the valence of the ion of the electrolyte, which is opposite to the charge of the alkaline, the stronger the precipitation power of the electrolyte
 jalasantrasi kalilon ko vidyudvishleshyon se surakshit rakhane ke liye unamem jalpremi kalil mila die jate hai
 This method is called conservation method
 swarnakalil ko gelatin kii sookshm maatra se avakshipt kiya ja saktaa he kintu is protein kii adhik maatra is kalil ko sthayitv pradaan karti he
 According to Jigmondi, the gold content of a black preservative is the number of milligrams of the preservative in the presence of 10 cubic centimeters of gold in the presence of 1 cubic cm of sodium chloride
 Can be precipitated by a solution whose concentration is 10 percent
 kalil kaa sangrakshan vishesh mahatv rakhata he or atyant pracheen samay se iskaa vyavhaar hota rahaa he
 It has already been said that there is charge on the black particles
 kalil par aavesh kaa prakaar gyaat karne ke liye saral avasorana prayog kiye ja sakate hai
 Positive compounds are absorbed by silica jelly and negative compounds by aluminum hydroxide
 jalasantrasi kalil ke sthayitv ke liye aavesh kaa sthaan pramukh he
 The type of charge depends on the physical nature of the substance and on the electrodynamic that provides stability to the particle
 udaahranarth yadi rajat iodide ke saul ko len to usapar aavesh kaa prakaar dhanatmak yaa rinatmak donon hi ho saktaa he
 If there is a subtle excess of silver nitrate in Kalil, then Saul will be positive
 iske vipareet yadi potacium iodide kaa aadhiky hua to saul rinatmak ho jayega
 It has been observed that the charge of the silver iodide membrane becomes positive due to the presumptive adsorption of the positive silver ion, and the charge of this ion becomes negative due to the negative ion adsorption of the positive iodide
 kalileey tal par aavesh kii maatra or vibhav dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran dwaara parimapit kiye jate hai
 Saul is filled in a tube containing two platinum electrodes
 ab saul main disht vidyuddhara pravaahit kii jaati he
 If the particles move towards the positive, there is a negative electric charge on them
 vidyut kshetra main kanon kii is prakaar kii gati dhan-vidyut-sanchaaran kehalaati he
 This speed can be conveniently measured by suitable optical methods
 veg ke maapan dwaara vidyudvibhav kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 This voltage is commonly called electrical-dynamic-voltage
 yah vidyutagtyatmk vibhav us samay bhi dekha jaataa he jab vidyudvishleshiya vilyan ko kisi sanrdhra tanupat se hokar bheja jaataa he
 Research has also been conducted on two other related verbs
 ye hai dharavibhav or avakshepan vibhav
 The electrical dynamic potential is different from the Nernst electrochemical potential 
 ab siddh ho gaya he ki vaidyuthik rasinic vibhav vah vibhav he jo vitarit kala or vitaran madhyam ke mukhya aaytan ke bich hota he
 The electrodynamic potential is the voltage that lies between the main volume of the distribution medium in the stationary part of the bicameral plane attached to that distributed art
 vitarit kala se sanlagn dwiktal kaa vaastavik swabhaav ab bhi kalpana kaa vishay he
 Nevertheless, it has been known that the electrodynamic-potential is particularly affected by the ions present
 gas ke niyam kalil vilyanon par thik baithte hai, iske paryaapt pramaan hai
 The curvature pressure of a Kalil can be calculated by the following equation: jahaan: Now, as the viscosity pressure is inversely proportional to the size of the particle, it makes it clear that the infusion pressure of the spiral should decrease and their volume should also increase with the distribution volume
 is prakaar saadhaarant: saulon kii rasakarshan daab kam hi hoti he or jab rasakarshan daab adhik ho jaati he to vah mukhyat: ashuddhiyon ke kaaran hi hoti he
 Measuring pressure is measured with the help of a semipermeable membrane
 vidyudvishleshan ke asmaan vitaran se kuch kalilon main dononsantulan naamak kriya ke kaaran jatilta utpann hoti he
 The study of this balancing act has been studied on dyes, soaps, and many other collicular electrodynamics called Congo Red
 in sthitiyon main kalileey padaarth vidyudvishleshya ke samaan vyavhaar karata he
 When the shape of an ion is similar to the shape of the calculus, when the potential is created on both sides of the dilute, which is called the dilute potential
 kai protein saulon main tanupat-vibhav sadaiv hi utpann ho jaataa he or jivit selon par aavesh is tanupat santulan ke kaaran hi hota he
 The shape or form of the calculus cannot be seen by looking through a microscope
 phir bhi kalilkanon kii sankhya gini ja sakati he; tab vitarit padaarth ke purna aaytan ke maan se ek kan kaa ausat aaytan gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 But when a Saul is made, then many particles of particles are present in it
 kalilkanon kaa rup golakaar, dandakaar, dirghavrittakar yaa paratdaar ho saktaa he
 Several methods have been developed to find the form of Kalilakanas which are based on optical properties
 in kalilon kii visheshta he vitaran madhyam kii shyanta par prabhaav daalana
 Viscosity increases mostly and increases with the increase in volume of the delivered material
 ek vishesh sandran ke pahunchne par shyanta itani bad jaati he ki kalil jelly kaa rup grahan kar letaa he
 Jelly can also be obtained from precipitation of Saul
 jelly kaa upyog simit sa he or gelatin, aighar aighar, starch aadi ke saulon ko sheethal karke jo ardhapardarshak jeliyaan banaai jaati hai unhen hi jelly kii sangya di jaati he
 Most waterfowl cultivars make jelly upon cooling or heating
 kai acarbonic jalasantrasi kalil bhi vishesh paristhitiyon main jelly ke rup main praapt kiye ja sakate hai
 In this way, many aqueous hydroxides, insoluble phosphates, molybdates gels are made in the laboratory
 jelly saadhaarant: taralamochan kaa gun pradarshit karti he
 The jelly shrinks and cracks when kept for a long time, and the water tied in the jelly comes out
 jeliyon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: pratyasth tathaa drudh

 It has been a trend that one cannot and does not ignore the path of Bharatanatyam training and the present medium presenting itself through "material" and the altered medium of "contemporary" Bharatanatyam
 is sandarbh main, 'badal madhyam' bheji ja karne ke liye sandesh ko badal sakate hai, jo andolanon, abhivyakti, saamaan, veshbhusha, sangeet, aadi main badlaav shaamil kar sakate hai
 The artist or choreographer tries to maintain a balance between the tradition of the past to suit contemporary concerns — it is said to be "to express dance and not to impress", it is factually Bharatanatyam The initial milestones have been embraced that were directly associated with the dance performed by the "devadasis"
 nrity kaa yah rup main baad main bhi bharatnatyam ko kala ke rup main naam diya jo rukmini devi arundell ne "punerjeevit kiya or mahima" kiya gaya tha

 As of now it is being developed to be the counter part to strengthen the parent-classical Bharatanatyam, to the extent that the entire topical Bharatanatyam parent dance form has been overshadowed
 shikshan bharatnatyam ke nae shaileyon jisase shastreey nrity ke paaramparik saar ko samrudh banane se nimnlikhit pidiyon naakaam viksit hoga
 There is no harm in contouring or stilagging any classical dance for as long as the traditional boundaries of classical dance are not treasured and hampered
 isliye, yah bharatnatyam apane samayik rup main, pradhanmantri times jivit rahane ke liye shastreey rup sahaayta karegaa ki mana ja saktaa he
 Depending on personal perception, this may seem well-metaphysical, while for some others, aesthetic experiences transcend and possibly appeal to something that is actually a subjective phenomenon
 bharatnatyam kaa uddeshy, anya dharmanirpeksh nrity roopon kii tarah, sahanaa or aam darshakon ko pyaari ho jayega ki ek drishy anubhav karne ke liye jis tarah se bhugtan karne ke liye hai

 The film starts from the present
 kai varsh biit chuke hote hai or ab adhed umr kaa atuly chakravarti urf bhootnath, jo ki ek vaastukar he, apane karmchaariyon ke saath ek haveli ke khandaron ko giraakar ek nayi imaarat kaa nirmaan karne ja rahaa he

 film samay main peeche chali jaati he or bhootnath gaanv se kolkata shahar naukari kii talash main apane munh bole bahanoi ke yahan aata he jo isi haveli ke mulaazimon kii rihaishgaah main rahata he
 This mansion belongs to one of the big zamindars of the city, Chaudhary Khanadan, who had three brothers - elder Babu, middle Babu and younger Babu
 film main pehle se hi bade babu kaa intkaal hua dikhaaya gaya he
 Bhoothnath gets a job in a Mohini sindoor factory that is owned by Subinay Babu, a Brahmo Samaji and a daughter with Jabba
 raat ko jab bhootnath haveli main chal rahe kriyakalapon ko dekhtaa he to achambhe main pad jaataa he
 Every night, the little babu sits in the hall and heads towards the cell of the tawaif
 vah chhipakar haveli main hi chal rahi manjhale babu kii mehafil kaa bhi anand letaa he
 Bhootnath goes to Subinay Babu to fix the advertisement which is printed soon of the factory but Jaba is there who asks Bhoothnath to read the advertisement
 us vigyaapan main aisi chamatkaari baaten likhi hoti hai ki yadi patni yaa premika us sindur ko dhaaran kar apane pati yaa premi ke saamne padati he to pati athwa premi us par mohit ho jaayegaa
 That night Chhoti Babu's servant Bansi comes to Bhootnath and says that the younger daughter-in-law is calling him
 donon chhipakar choti bahu ke kamare main jate hai or choti bahu bhootnath ko sindur kii dibiya thamakar kahati he ki isamen mohini sindur bhar ke laaye taaki vah apane bewafaa pati ko apane vash main kar sake
 Bhootnath is mesmerized by the beauty and anguish of the younger daughter-in-law and becomes a part of her secrets even if she does not want to
 bhootnath agle din mohini sindur kii sachai subinay babu se sunanaa chahta he lekin subinay babu is baat ko taal jate hai
 Still, he is so distraught with the suffering of the younger daughter-in-law that he takes that vermilion to the younger daughter-in-law
 isi bich bhootnath kaa munh bolaa bahanoi ek swatantraaa senaanee nikalataa he jo bich bazaar angrez police par bam kaa hamalaa kar detaa he or uske baad chali goli-baari main bhootnath kii taang zakhmi ho jaati he

 The vermilion given by Bhoothnath to the younger daughter-in-law does not have any effect; however, Chhoti Babu says to the younger daughter-in-law that if he dances with her like a dancer and celebrates all the night, then he is ready to stay in the house
 choti bahu yah chunauti bhi sweekaar kar leti he or apane pati ko ghar main rakhane ke liye sharaab pinaa or tawaayphon ke jaisaa bartaav bhi shuru kar detii he
 The trick succeeds for a few days and Chhote Babu starts spending time with his younger daughter-in-law
 lekin aiyashi ke shikaar chote babu ek din apni priy tawaayph ke kothe main pahonchte hai to pate hai ki unka dushman chheni dutt uske raas main duba he
 Chhani Dutt and his companions make Chhota Babu bloodied and he becomes crippled
 jab kuch samay baad bhootnath waapas aata he to paata he ki choti bahu ko to sharaab kii lat lag gayi he or chote babu aapng pade hai
 When he goes to Jaba, it is learned that Subinay Babu has just passed away and Jaba is a girl from an elite family rather than Mlech and Subinay Babu had stolen Jabba from the village but at the age of one year He was married to the incomparable Chakraborty of the same village
 apane pati ko thik karne kii ummid main choti bahu bhootnath ke saath kisi siddh purush ke ashram kii ore nikalati he
 The middle babu hears all the things that have happened between Bhootnath and the younger daughter-in-law
 unke safar ke bich main hi manjhale babu ke gurge bhootnath ko maar-markar adhamra kar dete hai or choti bahu kaa kahin bhi pataa nahin chalata he
 The film then arrives in the present and Bhootnath's attendants tell him that they have found a grave in the mansion yard
 jab bhootnath vahaan jaakar dekhtaa he to kankal ke baazuu main pahane huye kade se pahchaan jaataa he ki yah shav choti bahu kaa hi he
 Towards the end of the film, Bhoothnath sits in a carriage with a mind in mind, holding a map of the new building in which Jaba is already seated and the coachman Baggi takes the lead

 chunki fibonachi prayaavartan raikhik he, in do shrinkhalaaon ke kisi bhi raikhik sangyojan se bhi prayaavartan kaa samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 ye raikhik sangyojan, ek do-aiami raikhik vector antar taiyaar karte hai; mul fibonachi anukram is antar main paaya ja saktaa he
 The series of linear combinations φ n { \ displaystyle \ varphi ^ {n}} and n { \ displaystyle ^ {n}}, including the coefficients a and b, can be defined by is prakaar paribhaashit sabhi shrinkhlaayein fibonachi prayaavartan kii purti karti hai Where f a, b = 0 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 0} and f a, b = 1 { \ displaystyle F_ {a, b} = 1} yields a = 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle a = 1 / { \ sqrt {5}}} and b = - 1 / 5 { \ displaystyle give b = -1 / { \ sqrt {5}}}, resulting in the same binet formula from which we started Was It has been shown that this formula fulfills the Fibonacci alternation
 In addition, an explicit investigation can be done: or Proving the original arrival questions, certify that isliye, kinhin do praarambhik mulyon ke liye, sangyojan a, b { \ displaystyle a,b} ko is tarah paaya ja saktaa he ki falan f a, b { \ displaystyle F_{a,b} \ ,}, anukram ke liye sateek purna sutara he
 Since for all n ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle n \ geq 0} | 1 - 4 n / 5 = 0 { \ displaystyle k> = 0} is found for integers iske vipareet, Sometimes the integer sums on the inverse Fibonacci numbers can be calculated in terms of theta function
 For example, we can write the sum of every odd-exponential Fibonacci number as follows or vargakar vyutkram fibonachi sankhya ke yoga ko nimna rup main If we add 1 to each Fibonacci number in the first sum, there will also be a complete formula
 or vargakar fibonachi sankhya kaa acha vargeekrut yoga he, jo sunahare anupaat kaa vyutkram detaa he, Such results seem correct to see that a complete formula for the simple sum of inverse Fibonacci numbers can be found, but no such has yet been known
 Despite that, the inverse Fibonacci constant richard andre-jianin dwaara aparimey sabit kiya gaya he

 Any consecutive three Fibonacci numbers, taking two at a time, have been proportional prime numbers: ie, or saamanytah, The divisibility of Fibonacci numbers by the prime p is related to the Legendre sign { \ displaystyle \ ; \ left} which is assumed to be as follows: agar p ek abhajya sankhya he, to f p ≡ and f p − ≡ 0 
 { \ displaystyle F_{p} \ equiv \ left{ \ pmod {p}} \ ; \ ;{ \ mbox{ and }} \ ; \ ; \ ;f_{p- \ left} \ equiv 0{ \ pmod {p}}

 The angle of deviation, adjacent to 137
51 °, is the golden angle, which divides the circle into the golden ratio
 Because this ratio is irrational, there is no one else at the same angle from the center, side of a floret, so the florets are efficiently filled together
