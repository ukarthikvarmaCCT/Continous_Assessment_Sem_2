 At this time, the practice of sacrificing death was prevalent in Prayag
 hong gangey dev jaise shasakon kaa anusaran karte hue kumaar gupt ne prayag jaakar swarg prapti kii laalasaa se apane jivan kaa tyaag kiya
 Art, science and literature gained immense prosperity during the Gupta period
 is kaal ke saath hi bharat ne mandir vaastukala evam murtikla ke utkrisht kaal main pravesh kiya
 The techniques of art were perfected through centuries of effort
 gupt kaal ke purv mandir sthaayee samagriyon se nahin banate the
 The construction of temples on permanent materials like brick and stone is a phenomenon of this period
 is kaal ke pramukh mandir hai- tigava kaa vishnu mandir, bhumara kaa shiv mandir, nachna kuthar kaa parvati mandir, devgarh kaa dashavatar mandir tathaa eenton se nirmit bhitargaanv kaa lakshmana mandir aadi
 Gupta temples were built on high platforms using permanent materials such as brick and stone
 aarambhik guptakaleen mandiron main shikhar nahin milte hai
 In this period, the temples were built on high platforms, on which steps were made to climb, and the roof of the temples was flat
 mandiron kaa garbhagrih bahut saadhaaran hota tha
 Gods were installed in the sanctum sanctorum
 praarambhik gupt mandiron main alankaran nahin miltaa he, lekin baad main stambhon, mandir ke diwaar ke bahari bhaagon, choukhat aadi par murtiyon dwaara alankaran kiya gaya he
 The Vishnu temple at Bhimgaon is carved
 guptakaleen mandiron ke praveshdwar par makarvahini ganga, yamuna, shankh va padam kii akritiyaan bani hai
 The best example of Gupta period temple art is the Dashavatara temple of Deogarh in which Gupta architecture is in its mature state
 yah mandir sundar murtiyon, udate hue pakshiyon, pavitra vriksh, swaastik evam phool-pattiyon dwaara alankrita he
 The theme of Gupta temples is derived from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas
 fakir arabi bhashaa ke shabd faqr se bana he jiskaa arth hota garib
 Sufi saints in Islam were therefore called fakirs because they used to pray for the betterment of common people in the form of dervish leading to poverty and painful life and through it the work of propagating Islam Pant in Middle East and South Asia
 aage chalakar yah shabd urdu, bangla or hindi bhashaa main bhi prachlan main aa gaya or iskaa shabdic arth bhikshuk yaa bheekh mangekar guzaara karne vaala ho gaya
 Just as among Hindus, Buddhist bhikkhu enjoyed social status among the masters, yogis and Buddhists, similarly among Muslims, fakirs were given the same status

 rajinder singh ek bhartiya sena pramukh general or dwitiya loksabhaa ke sadsy the
 His nickname in the army was 'sparrow'
 unhone bhartiya sena kii vibhinn ikaayiyon main 3 oktober 1932 se 31 janvari 1938 tak kaary kiya
 He later joined the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun and joined the Indian Army on 1 February 1938 in the uprated list
 agle saal unhen ,da kings regiment ,jo ek british sena regiment thi ,main, uttar pashchim seemaa par tainaat kiya gaya
 On 24 February 1939, he was inducted into the 7th Light Cavalry of the Indian Army

 He opted for the Indian Army on the partition of India in 1947 and from September 1947 to May 1949 commanded the 7th Light Cavalry
 1 9 47 ke bharat-pakistani yuddh ke dauraan pehali baar unhen bharat ke duusare sabase bade sainya sammaan, do mahavir chakron se sammanit kiya gaya
 He received this honor for outstanding leadership and for winning the Battle of Zangar

 Chromosomes or chromosomes are fibrous nodules found in cells of all flora and fauna, which determine and transmit all genetic properties
 prayek prajati main gunasutron kii sankhya nishchit rahati hai
 The number of chromosomes in a human cell is 46, in pairs of 23
 iname se 22 gunasutra nar or maadaa main samaan or apane-apane jode ke samajaat hote he
 These are collectively called homologous chromosomes
 23wein jode ke gunasutra stri or purush main samaan nahin hote jinhe vishamjaat gunasutra kehete he
 In the structure of a chromosome, two substances are specifically incorporated - di en e hi anuvanshik padaarth he
 The structure of the DNA molecule consists of four organic compounds: two purines, two pyrimidines, one sugar-deoxyribose, and phosphoric acid
 purine main adinine or guanin hote he or pirimidine main thymin or cytosin 
 a molecule of DNA has two formulas, which ring around each other in a spiral form
 prayek di en e sutara main ek ke peeche ek chaaron carbonic samaakshar is kram se hote hai-thymin, cytosin, adinin or guanin, evam ve paraspar ek vishesh dhang se jude hote hai
 a unit of these four chambers and their related sugars and phosphoric acid molecule is a tetranucleotid and a DNA molecule is formed of several millennium tetranucleotids
 vibhinn praaniyon ke di en e kii vibhinnata kaa kaaran he - samaakshaaron ke anukram main antar hona
 DNA and a similar nucleic acid RNA combine with ultraviolet in the region of most 2,600 angstroms due to the presence of organic clear
 isi aadhaar par di en e kaa ek koshika sambandhi maatraatmak aagaman kiya jaataa he
 Two special types of centrosomes are found in beings
 ek to kuch deptra insecta main dimbhiy largranthi ke centrakon main paaya jaataa he
 These chromosomes are several hundred times longer and wider than ordinary chromosomes of the same species
 is kaaran inhen mahagunasutra kehete hai
 Their structure appears to be somewhat different from the simple centrosome and semisolid centers
 yahan ek gunasutra ke sthaan par ek anuprastha pankti aisi kanikaon kii hoti he jinamein abhiranjit hote kii yogyata adhik hoti hai
 All the corpuscles of many such transverse rows from one end of the chromosome to the other are identical and the corpuscles of the other rows have characteristics and differences
 in gunasutron ke adhik lambey hone ke kaaran yah samajha jaataa he ki inkaa purna rup se visarpelikaran hota he or kadachit protein kaa kuch badhaav bhi hota hai
 The reason for being wider is that a chromosome synthesizes another nucleus similar to its own
 saadhaaran avasthaa main samasutran ke samay ye donon sutara ek duusare se pruthak ho jate hai, parantu mahagunasutra main yah nahin hota
 The two sutras remain connected to each other
 mahagunasutra kii sankhya saadhaaran gunasutra kii sankhya kii aadhi hoti he, kyonki prayek sutara apane samaan duusare sutara se yugmit ho jaataa he
 This phenomenon is called somatic coupling
 jantuon main vicitra prakaar kaa ek or bhi gunasutra paaya jaataa he
 Its lampbrush is called chromosome
 ye gunasutra aise jantuon ke andon ke centrakon main paae jate hai jinamein andpit kii maatra adhik hoti he, jaise machhlee, ubhaychar, urag, pakshigan ityadi
 The chromosomes are made up of two coupled formulas similar to ordinary diplotene-diakinisis chromosomes
 donon yugmit sutara kuch sthanon par ek duusare se jude hote hai or shesh sthanon par ek duusaren se dur dur rahete hai
 These joints are considered kijma
 prayek sutara par, jisakon chromonima kehete hai, sthaan sthaan par vibhinn parisaan kii kanikas hoti hai jinako chromemrs kehete hai
 Each chromomier has a pair or more lateral clusters attached
 parshvapash bhi chromonima ke sadrush sutara kaa bana hota he, parantu iske chaaron ore rebonuclio-protein kanikas ekatrit ho jaati hai jisase ye sutara mote dikhaai dete hai
 Chromomers also breed with chromonima
 centrekaayen vishesh gunasutra par utpann hoti hai
 In most cells each chromosome has two integral clusters
 paripakv lingakoshikaon main ek kulak rah jaataa he
 Such animals and cells are said to be diploid, but some animals, especially plants, have more than two kulas of chromosomes
 yadi kisi dwiguneet praani ke cendraksutra dugune ho jaae, jisase uski koshikaaye main prayek sutara chaar chaar hon jaise, to aise praani kaa atopoliploid kehete hai
 If the chromosome of a diploid hybrid is doubled, such a creature is called an allopolyploid
 yadi ek dwiguneet praani kaa, jiskicendraksutra k1 k1 kha1 kha1 ga1 ga1 ityadi hai, kisi duusare praani se, jiske gunasutra k2 k2 kha2 kha2 ga2 ga2 ityadi hai, sankaran kiya jaae to uski santan ke gunasutra k1 k2 kha1 kha2 ga1 ga2 ityadi honge
 A1 a2 b1 b2 etc
 will be different from each other and there will not normally be coupling
 yadi is praani ke gunasutra dugune ho jaae to unki koshikaaye main k1 k1 k2 k2; kha1 kha1kha2 kha2; ga1 ga1 ga2 ga2, ityadi gunasutra honge
 This will be called allopolyploid
 poliploid main chaar se adhik kulak bhi ho sakate hai
 It is clear that the autopolyploid will produce quadruplexes in the zygotein state, because each of the four chromosomes of each type is present, and the coupling of the four formulas creates one quadrupole
 koshikavibhaajan ke samay prayek dhruv ko baraabar baraabar sankhya main gunasutra nahin milenge
 Often it happens that three threads reached a pole due to the breakdown of a quadrilateral and only one thread reached its opposite pole
 koshikavibhaajan ke ant par bane hue santati koshikaon main gunasutra yaa to adhik sankhya main honge yaa kam main or aise asantulan kaa parinaam yah hota he ki koshika mar jaati he
 This is why autotetraploids are much less fertile
 autotetraploid paudhe saadhaaran dwiguneet paudhon se bahut bade hote hai tathaa unke beej bhi bahut bade hote hai, jisase urvartaa kam hone par bhi ye gruhasthi ke liye adhik laabhadaayak siddh ho sakate hai
 By providing frost, or with the effect of some alkaloids, plant autopolyploids can be made
 elotetraploid main dasha iske vipareet hoti hai
 If the two primitive parent formulas are completely different from each other, the allopolyploid is functionally diploid and will be completely fertile
 jaise, yadi kisi sankar main k1 k2, kha1 kha2, ga1 ga2 se sutara sarvatha bhinn hon to aisa sankar bandhya hoga, parantu iske gunasutron ke dugune hone se yah avasthaa badal jaaygi
 Such cells will have formulas such as A1, 1A, 2A2, B1B1B2B2, C1C1, C2C2, etc
 and the branches that contain such cells will flower, because such cells will have successful myiotic division, coupled with A1A1, B1B1, etc
 
 datura stramonium main dwiguneet avasthaa main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or ardhasuthran ke samay dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its autopolyploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes and at the time of meiosis, 12 quiescent are formed
 isi bhanti primmula sinencis se dwiguneet paudhe main 12 jodi gunasutra hote hai or autotetraploid main 48 sutara hote hai evam ardhasuthran ke samay isamen 9 se 11 chatu:sanyojak or 2 se 6 tak dwisanyojak banate hai
 The diploid of Solomon lycopersicon has 12 pair chromosomes and its autotetraploid has 12 quaternary chromosomes
 ye sab paudhe hai
 The creepis rubra and araepis foetida have 5 pairs of chromosomes
 inke sutara ek duusare se bahut bhinn nahin hote or inke sankaran se utpann sankar main ardhsutran ke samay 5 dwisanyojak banate hai
 Its allopolyploid consists of 20 centrioles and in meiosis there are 0 to 5 quadruple connectives and 0 to 10 divisors
 spasht he ki elotetraploid bahut urvar nahin hoga
 Primula floribanda and Primula resticillata both have nine pair of chromosomes, which are often identical
 inke sankaran se jo sankar banaata he uske prituja kivensis kehete hai
 It also has 9 pairs of chromosomes
 ardhasuthran ke samay main yugman kriya safal hoti he or 9 dwisanyojak banate hai
 The allopolyploid formed by the diploid of the formulas has 9 quaternary formulas and in such plants 12 to 18 are divalent and 0 to 3 quadruple
 spasht he ki chatu:sanyojaakon kii sankhya bahut kam he or kabhi kabhi ek bhi chatu:sanyojak nahin banataa
 Radish and Karamkalla each have 9 pairs of chromosomes, which are completely different from each other
 inke sankaran se utpann sankar refanas brasika main bhi 9 jodi gunasutra hote hai; parantu ardhasuthran main ek hi dwisanyojak nahin banataa, kyonki yugman kii kriya safal nahin hoti or sabhi sutara ayugmit rah jate hai jisase 12 ek-sanyojak banate hai
 The allotetraploid resulting from its formula diploid consists of 12 pair formulas and the meiosis consists of 12 valence, quadrilateral none
 parinaam yah hota he ki refanas-brasika-elotetraploid bahut urvar hota he, yadhyapi refanas-brasika-dwiguneet bandhya hota he
 Polyploidy is rarely found in animals, but it is most often found in non-sterile animals
 paudhon main bahut si nai jatiyaan poliploid ke kaaran utpann hui hongi
 This is evidenced by the fact that about half of the species of angiosperms are such that the number of chromosomes of mature gametes is multiplied by the number of alleles of a related race
 gehun kii kai jatiyaan hai
 The basic zygote center number of these castes is 7
 gunasutron kii sankhya gehun kii jatiyon main 7 kii guneet 14,21,42 tathaa 49 tak pai jaati he
 Similarly, the number of chromosomes in different species of tobacco is 12 or 12 multiplied by 24
 paudhon main prayog dwaara bahut se poliploid banaae gaye hai, jinamein ekaatmak sutron ke do kulak hote hai
 They are fertile
 isamen andeh nahin ki koshikadravya, cendrak ke niyantran main kaaryshil hota he
 Many types of cell groups are engaged in conducting other tasks
 udhaahrant: agnyash kii exocrine koshikaaye vishesh pachak kinvaj utpann karti hai
 The cells of the renal tubule extract the urea from the blood and the liver cells converge to glucose by converting them into glycogen
 spasht he ki kisi bhi praani kii prayek koshika main uske sab jin saadhaarant: upasthit hote hai
 Therefore, at the origin of different types of proteins of different types of cells, some suitable genes must have been active and the rest have become inactive and the same thing will happen with respect to their activation

 The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them, the ubiquitous ether had a distinctive place
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe

 Psychology considers crime to be the result of man's mental complications
 jis vyakti kaa balykaal prem ore protsaahan ke vaataavaran main nahin bitta uske man main unek prakaar kii hinata kii maansik granthiyaan ban jaati hai
 In these glands, a lot of his mental strength is stored in his mind
 dow alfred edler kaa kathan he ki jis vyakti ke man main hinata kii maansik granthiyaan rahati hai vah anivaary rup se anek prakaar ke aparaadh karata he
 He commits this crime so that he can prove himself stronger than others
 hinata kii granthi tis vyakti main man main rahati he vah sadaa bhitari maansik asantosh kii sthiti main rahata he
 He keeps himself engaged in such works all the time so that everyone will look at him and praise him
 hinata kii maansik granthi manushya ko aise kaamon main lagaati he jinke karne se manushya ko anek prakaar kii ninda sunani padati he
 This person always wants to keep himself the subject of discussion

 ise kashmir ke duusare yuddh ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 a dispute has been going on between India and Pakistan since the Partition for the right over the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 1947 main bharat-pakistan ke bich pratham yuddh bhi kashmir ke liye hi hua tha
 Pakistan started this battle by sending its soldiers as infiltrators in the hope that the people of Kashmir would revolt against India
 is abhiyaan kaa naam pakistan ne yudhbhiyaan jibraltar rakhaa tha
 Thousands of people from both sides were killed in this war lasting five months
 is yuddh kaa ant sanyukt raashtra ke dwaara yuddh viraam kii ghoshnaa ke saath hua or taashkand main donon pakshon main samjhauta hua
 Most of this battle was fought by the army on both sides

 In the war, infantry and armored troops took part in many campaigns with the help of the Air Force
 dono paksho ke bich hue anek yudhon kii tarah is yuddh kii anek jaankariyaan donon pakshon ne saarvajanik nahin kii
 Since the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, there were many issues going on between India and Pakistan, although the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was the biggest in it, but there were other border disputes, the most prominent of which was the Rann of Kutch, which was a It was a barren area, was on the partition of 20 march 1965 main pakistan ke dwaara jaanboojh kar kuccha ke ran main jhadpen shuru kar di gayi
 Initially they included only the Border Security Force, but later the army of both the countries also joined the war
 On 1 June 1965, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson stopped the fight between the two sides by a fair arbitral court to resolve the dispute
 Established is nyaayalay ne kuccha ke ran kii kareeb 900 varg kilometre jagah pakistan ko de di
 However, Pakistan claimed 3500 square kilometers
 
 Encouraged by the success of the Kutch run, Pakistani politicians, especially the then Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, pressured the President and the Chief of Army Staff General Ayub Khan to order an attack on Kashmir
 bharat us samay china se yuddh haar chukaa tha or unka maananaa tha ki bharat us samay yuddh karne kii sthiti main nahin tha
 Apart from this, Bhutto and other generals agreeing with his view, Yahya Khan and Tikka Khan also believed that the people of Kashmir were willing to merge with Pakistan by liberating from India and would revolt in support of them when the soldiers were disguised as infiltrators
 aakhir general ayub khan dabaav main aa gayi or unhone gupt sainik abhiyaan oparation jibraltar kaa aadesh de diya
 The main objective of this campaign was to incite rebellion among the people of Kashmir and damage the Indian communication system and transport system
 pakistan ke ghuspaithiyon ko jaldi hi pahchaan liya gaya or vidroh karne ke bajaay janata ne unki soochna bhartiya sainikon ko de di or yah abhiyaan purnatah vifal ho gaya
 On August 5, 1965, between 26000 and 3 xxrep 4 0 Pakistani soldiers crossed the Line of Control in the dress of the local population of Kashmir and entered Indian Kashmir
 bhartiya sena ne sthaneey aabaadi se isaki soochna paakar 15 agast ko niyantran rekha ko paar kiya

 With the help of artillery, he captured three important hill stations

 The Indians were successful in bringing additional troops and India entered 8 km into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and captured the Haji Pir Pass

 The expedition came under occupation of the infiltrators of Gibraltar by the Indians and the expedition failed
 yahi nahin, pakistan kii kaman ko lagane laga ki pakistani kashmir kaa mahatvapurn shahar mujaffarabad ab bharatiyo ke kabje main jane hi vaala he
 Pakistan launched a new campaign Operation Grand Slam to ease the pressure on Muzaffarabad
 1 sitambar 1965 ko pakistan ne grand slam naamak ek abhiyaan ke tahat samrik drushti se mahatvapurn shahar akhnur jammu or kashmiripar kabje ke liye akraman kar diya
 The purpose of this campaign was to break the Kashmir Valley's connectivity with the rest of India so that its logistics and communication system was disrupted
 pakistan ke is akraman ke liye bharat taiyaar nahin tha or pakistan ko baari sankhya main sainiko or behatar kism ke tanko kaa laabh mil rahaa tha
 In the beginning, India had to face heavy damage, on which the Indian Army used an aerial attack, in response, Pakistan attacked the air base of Punjab and Srinagar
 yuddh ke is charan main pakistan atyadhik behatar sthiti main tha or is apratyaashit hamale se bhartiya kheme main ghabrahat fail gayi thi
 The passing of Akhnoor into the hands of the Pakistani Army could have posed a threat to the Kashmir Valley of India

 Despite the delay of a day, the army chief of the Western Command of India knew that Pakistan was in a very good position and to stop it, he gave a proposal to the then Chief of Army Staff General Chaudhary to open a new front in the Punjab border and attack Lahore
 Be given
 general choudhary is baat se sahamat nahin the lekin tatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shashtri ne unki baat ansuni kar is hamale kaa aadesh de diya
 On September 6, India crossed the international border and attacked the Western Front and made the official start of the war
 6 sitambar ko bharat kii 15ve paidal sainya ikai ne dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke anbhavi major general prasad ke netratv main icchhogil nahar ke pashchimi kinare main pakistan ke bade hamale kaa saamana kiya
 The Ichogil Canal was the de facto border of India and Pakistan
 is hamale main khud major general prasad ke kafile par bhi hamalaa hua or unhe apana vaahan chhod kar bhaagna padaa
 India succeeded in crossing the canal near Barki village in retaliation

 Meanwhile, Pakistan attacked Khemkaran to reduce the pressure on Lahore and captured it
 In return, India attacked Bedi and its surrounding villages
 6 sitambar ko lahore par hamale main bhartiya sena ke pratham paidal sainya khand ke saath dwitiya bakhtarband upkhand ke teen tanks daste shaamil the
 They immediately crossed the border and reached the Ichogil Canal, the Pakistan Army deployed defense teams on the bridges, the bridges which could not be saved were blown up, this move of Pakistan stopped the Indian army moving forward
 jat regiment kii ek ikai 3 jat ne nahar paar karke dograi or batapore par kabja kar liya
 On the same day, the Pakistan Army, with the help of armored unit and air force, made a large counter attack on the 15th section of the Indian Army, although it caused only minor damage to the 3 Jats but the 15th segment had to retreat and its logistics and weapons vehicles were severely damaged
 bhartiya sena ke bade adhikario ko jamini halaat kii sahi jaankaree nahin thi atah unhone is ashanka se ki 3 jat ko bhi baari nuksaan hua he use peeche hatane kaa aadesh de diya isse 3 jat ke kaman aadhikari ko badi niraashaa hui or baad main unhe dograi par phir kabja karne ke liye badi keemat chukaani padi
 On 8 December 1965, a squad of 5 Maratha Light Infantry was sent to strengthen the Rajasthan Military Force stationed at Munabav, a strategically important town

 5 3 Gurkhas and 954 heavy artillery squad sent to help Maratha could not reach due to heavy attack of Pakistani Air Force and Tran coming from Barmer after taking logistics also became an attack near Garda Road Rail Base 10 September Munabao was captured by Pakistan
 9 sitambar ke baad kii ghatnaon ne dono deshon kii senaao ke sabase garvit khando kaa dambh chur chur kar diya
 The 1st Armored Division of India, called the Pride of the Indian Army, attacked in the direction of Sialkot
 chhavinda main pakistan kii apekshaakrit kamjor 6 bakhtarband khand ne buree tarah haraa diya bhartiya sena ko kareeb kareeb 100 tanks gavaane pade or peeche hatane par majaboor hona padaa
 Encouraged by this, Pakistan's army attacked the Indians and entered further into the Indian border
 apane antim aakraamak ke liye pakistan apane pehla bakhtarband divijan or 11vaan infantry divijan ke saath amritsar par kabje ke iraade se khemkaran par hamalaa kar diya
 According to him, after Amritsar, according to the statement from Jalandhar and then President Ayub Khan, Delhi would be the next target

 And here, between them, the second largest tank battle was fought after World War, in which Pakistan suffered a tremendous defeat
 usne apane 97 tanks kho diye, jisamen 72 paton tanks shaamil the; iske alaava 32 tanks chalati haalat main kabja kar liya gaya
 Where before, the advancing Pakistani army lost in the war of the real north, the balance of war was tilted in favor of India
 iske baad yah jagah america main bane paton naam ke pakistani tanko ke upar paton nagar ke naam se janaa jane laga
 After this battle, Pakistan's first armored division was sent back to Sialkot where it did not participate further in the war

 In the battle 3000 Indian Army and 3800 Pakistani Army soldiers were martyred

 The Indian state had fertile areas of Sialkot, Lahore and Kashmir, while Pakistan occupied the barren areas of Sindh and Chamba
 is yuddh main aazaadee ke baad pehali baar bhartiya vaayu sena evam pakistani vaayu sena ke vimaanon ne ek dusre kaa muqabla kiya
 Earlier, both of these air forces participated in the First Kashmir War in the 1940s, in which their contribution was much less and limited to transportation as compared to 1965 war
 bhartiya vaayu sena ke paas badi sankhya main hoker hunter, bharat main nirmit folland nait, de havilland vempaire, i i canberra bamavarshak or mig-21 kii ek squadran thi
 The Pakistani Air Force's fadter planes were 102 F-86F sabers and 12 F-104 starfighters, and 24 B-57 Canberra bombers
 sangharsh ke dauraan bharat or pakistan vaayu senaaon kaa anupaat 5:1 tha
 However, the two air forces were similar in the war, as most of the Indian Air Force was stationed east to avoid the possibility of China entering the war
 pakistani vimaan zyaadaatar america the, jabaki bharat ke paas soviet va europea vimaanon kaa mila jula bedaa tha
 It was widely circulated that Pakistan's American aircraft are better than Indian aircraft, but according to some experts this was not correct as the Indian Air Force's mig-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Nate fighter's performance from their rival Pakistan's F-86 Saber Was better
 yuddh main pakistan kii nan0 19 squadran kaa netritv karne vaale air commander sajaad haidar ke anusaar- haalaanki bhartiya vayusena ke vempaire fiter vimaan F-86 saibar ke mukaable puraane or kamazor the, lekin hunter vimaan shakti evam gati donon main hi unase behatar the
 According to Indians, the F-86 was weak in front of the small Folland Nate, causing these aircraft to be called "saber destroyers"
 pakistan vayusena kaa F-104 starfiter upmahadweep main us samay kaa sabase tej gati kaa fiter vimaan tha or use praayah "pakistan vayusena kaa garv" kaha jaataa tha
 But according to Sajjad Haider, those aircraft did not deserve this honor because they were made with the "purpose of stopping and combating Soviet bombers flying at an altitude of more than 40,000 feet", not with low-speed fighter aircraft
 To fight
 atah ye us samay ke maahaul ke upyukt nahin the
 "the Indian Air Force was worried because of Starfighter, but they did not prove to be as effective in combat as the slower but more agile, Folland Nat Fighter
 phir bhi saibar or nats ke bich chale dwand yuddh main supersonic gati ke saath, saibar kahi zyada safal rahaa
 Both countries have made contrary claims to each other about the losses incurred in the fighting and few neutral sources have verified them
 pakistani vayusena kaa daawa tha ki usne bharat ke 104 vimaan giraae or apane 19 vimaan khoe, jabaki bhartiya vayusena ne daawa kiya ki unhone pakistan ke 73 vimaan giraae or apane 35 vimaan khoe
 According to a neutral source, the Pakistani Air Force flew 86 F-86 Sabers, 10 F-104 Starfighters, and 20 B-57 Canberra aircraft in a parade held shortly after the end of the war, claiming that the Indian Air Force had dropped 73 Pakistani aircraft
 It seems to be wrong, which was almost the entire first line of fighter jets of Pakistan at that time
 pakistan vayusena ke keval ek squadran ko khone ke daavon ko, bhartiya sutron ne nakaarte hue bataaya he ki, pakistan ne shuruuaati yuddh ke 10 dinon ke bheetar hi indonesia, iraq, iran, turki or china se atirikt vimaan hasil karne kii maang kii thi
 According to independent sources, the PAF had lost some 20 aircraft while the Indians had lost 60–75 aircraft
 pakistan ne yuddh kii samaapti tak apni 17 pratishat agrim pankti kii takat kho di, jabaki bharat kaa nuksaan 10 pratishat se bhi kam tha
 In addition, it is estimated that if the conflict had continued for three weeks, the Pakistani losses would have increased by 33 percent and India's losses would have been 15 percent
 1965 ke yuddh main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad tinkon ke sabase bade yuddh lade gaye
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armor was largely American-made; It consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; Some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions – the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armored division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armored Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which resulted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armored Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced the same results, India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armored Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armor, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armored Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armored formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defense writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbor
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 Both India and Pakistan made absolutely mismatched claims about the loss of themselves and others
 donon deshon ke daavon kii sankshipt sarini is prakaar he There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agreed that India had an upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below - The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the UN The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time sanyukt raashtra intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, bharat had the better of the war
 nai dilli achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest - it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 square miles of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 square miles of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh ne donon dakshin asian deshon ke bich sangharsh main or vruddhi ko rokane ke liye mahatvapurn rajanyik upkaran kaa upyog kiya
 The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexi Kossian, hosted a ceasefire talks in Tashkent, where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, withdrawing forces from 25 February 1966 onwards in pre-august Agreed to
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, bharat budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the sanyukt raashtra Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war - which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India - and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, bharat reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 disambar killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 farvari 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hui kai ranneetik galatiyon ke kaaran yah yuddh benatija si sthiti main aa pahunchaa
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal PC Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian Army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defense and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian Army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game - conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defense Analysis, USA
 The exercise awaited that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military 


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani air marshall va commander in chif of PAF during the war, nur khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, bharat agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, bharat was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's obvious to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, India's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further substantial damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates - India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, India focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, India established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defense Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defense of Lahore against the Indian Army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realized the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority - if not invincibility - of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, bharat did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971

 marudgan ek devgan kaa naam
 In the Vedas, he is written as the son of Rudra and Vrishni and his number is considered three times 60; But in the Puranas, he is written as the son of Kashyapa and Diti, who was cut by one of his pregnant brothers Indra by cutting the womb into forty-nine pieces, who died forty-nine
 vedon main marudagan kaa sthaan antariksh likhaa he, unke ghode kaa naam 'prishit' batalaaya he tathaa unhen indra kaa sakha likhaa he
 In the Puranas, they have been considered as the angels of the wind

 After this, Diti blinked during the day and her head started going to the feet, which polluted her body and dissolved her tenacity
 Here Indra was also worried about the defeat of Diti's son and decided to end the pregnancy
 Indra cut this womb into 7 pieces
 When Diti woke up, when he came to know about the seven pieces of the womb, he told Indra that due to the dissolution of my tenacity, my womb has broken into pieces, there is no fault of you
 Diti then said that even after being cut, these pieces of my womb will always move in the sky and will be known as Marut
 These seven will be the seven Ganas of Marut who can roam around seven places and thus a total of 49 Marutas are made

 But the men of the ancient Pandya dynasty were still surviving
 praaia: ye lanka ke saath milakar cholon kaa virodh karte the
 With this, all the Chola kings between Rajendra i and Kulottung i mention their victory over Pandya kings
 kulottung pratham ne apane rajyakaal main pandyon ke vidroh ko kuchalakar rajya kaa shashan pandya rajvansh ke hi vyaktiyon ko saunp diya
 After Kulottung no records are found to prove the rule of the Cholas over the Pandya kingdom
 pandya cholon ke adheen the lekin dhire dhire unke prabhaav se mukt hote gaye
 In 1166 AD, there was discord for succession between Parakram Pandya and Kulasekhar
 lanka ke naresh parakrambahu ne parakram kii sahaayta ke liye sena bheji
 Kulasekhar was assisted by the Cholas
 ant main lanka kii sena parajeet hui
 Parakramabhu, having overthrown his position in Lanka as a result of this conflict, accepted Kulasekhar's right to a secret treaty with the Cholas
 cholon ne pandya singhaasana ke liye vir pandya kaa samarthan kiya or kulsekhar ko bhaga diya
 This time Parakramabahu turned Veer Pandya against the Cholas in his favor
 kintu chol phir vijayi hue or unhone vikram pandya ko madura ke singhaasana par baithaaya
 Veer Pandya also accepted the subjection of the Cholas
 cholon kii ksheen hoti hui shakti kaa laabh uthaakar pandyon ne apane swatantra rajya kii sthapana kii
 This second kingdom of Pandyas begins with Jatavarman Kulasekhar
 kintu jatavarman kulsekhar kii swatantra hone kii laalasaa ko chol naresh kulottung tritiy ne dabaa diya tha
 Anuj Marvarman Sundar Pandya of Jatavarman started the second Pandya kingdom in true form
 usne chol rajya par akraman karke chindbaram tak kii vijay kii thi
 But due to the intervention of the Hoysalas, he left the Cholas only to accept subjugation
 duusari baar usne chol naresh rajraj tritiy ko parajeet kiya kintu is baar bhi hoyasalon ke hastkshep karne par vah chol samrajya par sthaayee adhikaar na kar sakaa
 Nevertheless, he had broad state boundaries
 marvarman sundar pandya dwitiya chol naresh rajendra tritiy ke haathon parajeet hua tha kintu hoyasalon ne pandyon kaa paksh lekar cholon ko manamaani nahin karne diya
 Jatavarman Sundar Pandya i was certainly the best emperor of this dynasty
 usne apane samakaleen cher, hoysal, chol, telegu, kakatiya or baan sabhi kaa apane parakram se abhibhoot kiya tha
 His empire expanded from Lanka to Nellore
 apni vijayon se praapt vaibhav kaa upyog usne chidambaram or shrirangam ke mandiron ko aakarshak or sampann banane main kiya
 His splendor of performance is reflected in his many inscriptions and balances
 jatavarman ne pandya rajkumaron ko uparaja ke rup main shashan se sambandhit kiya tha
 This method has also been mentioned by foreign writers
 jatavarman sundar pandya pratham ke saath jatavarman vir pandya pramukh uparaja tha
 Marvarman Kulasekhar started his reign as a king in the last years of Jatavarman Sundar Pandya
 swayan uske saath anek uparaaje sambhddha the jinamein pramukh hai jatavarman sundar pandya dwitiya or tritiy, jatavarman vir pandya dwitiya or marvarman vikram pandya
 Marwarman Kulasekhar was the last great emperor of this dynasty
 usne chol, hoysal or lanka ke nareshon tathaa anya duusare shaskaon ko phir se parajeet kiya tha
 Marco Polo and the Muslim historian Vassaf have described his power and splendor
 marvarman kii vriddhavastha main uske do putron jatavarman sundar pandya or jatavarman vir pandya main singhaasana ke liye sangharsh hua jisamen kulsekhar kii mrityu hui
 Taking advantage of the weak power of the Pandyas, Alauddin Khalji's commander Malik Kafur attacked and looted Madura
 kintu pandya raajaaon kii sthiti phir bhi bani rahi
 Chera Naresh Ravivarman Kulasekhar and the Kakatiyas captured some parts of the Pandya kingdom
 anek sanmaton ne swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kar di
 The second Muslim invasion of the Pandya kingdom came under Khumru Khan in 1329 AD and consequently the appointment of a governor by the Sultan of Delhi at Madura
 phir bhi pandyon kaa adhikaar madura, ramnad, tanjor, dakshini aakati or pudukkottai par bana rahaa
 But after the establishment of the Vijayanagara Empire over Madura by vibration, the dominance of the Pandyas remained confined to Tinnevelly only
 ab pandyon kaa itihaas kramik patan kii katha maatr rah jaataa he
 In the early 16th century, this dynasty was completely erased
