 rolling ne harry potter or haaf-blad prince main khulaasa kiya he ki yuva meropi gont tom riddle ke kareeb aane kaa har sambhav prayaas karti thi, khidki va jhaadiyon se har maukey par us par nazar rakhti thi
 Moffin fumed his sister's love for Tom and began to use magic on him
 yah jaaduugari ke niyamon kaa ulanghan tha jiske kaaran uskaa jaadu mantralay se bheeshan yuddh hota he or iske baad moffin va uske pita marvolo ko azkaaban main kaid kar liya gaya
 According to Dumbledore, in the meantime Meropi became completely alone and her father had lost control over her, she could no longer resemble Tom
 vah tom ko prem kaadhe se yukt peya padaarth detii he
 For this reason he becomes infatuated with Meropi and the two run away and get married

 chunki moffin gont parivaar kaa antim purush tha, is kaaran se uski mrityu ke pashchaat gont parivaar kaa ant ho jaataa he
 Meropi Gaunt was the daughter of Marvolo and sister of Moffin
 harry kaa meropi ke vishay main pehla prabhaav aaj tak ke sabase zyada haari hui insaan ke rup main padaa
 Possibly such an impact on him was due to Meropi's poverty, malaise and upbringing among the rude

 uskaa maananaa tha ki uske mata -pita kii magaluon se nikatataa isolt ke liye sahi nahin he
 The ferocious and fanatical Garmlath used black magic to isolate Islott from the Magaloo, not allowing him to use a stick, not even entering Hogwarts, as he himself did
 12 saal uske saath rahane ke baad islot ne garmaleith kii chadi chura lee tathaa vah america upnivesh ke ore bhaag gayi or masachusets main rahane lagi

 duusare va chhathen sanskaran main ateet main smriti paatr dwaara uski dekhi kahaniyon ke anusaar vah fiki twachaa, jet jaise kaale baalo va gahari bhuri aankhon ke saath sundar va lambaa tha
 He could attract everyone with his look
 aisa anumaan he ki uske manushya rup se daitya banane kaa kaaran apni amar hone kii chahat main aatma ko vibhajit karke horcrax bananaa tha
 Voldemort's eyes in the film are blue and the pupil rounded
 rolling ne voldemort kaa "saikadon varshon kaa dushtatam jaadugar" ke rup main varnan kiya he
 He described her as "highly psychotic, lacking the human response to other people's suffering"
 saath hi use apni kushi ke kaaran dusron, visheshkar magaluon, ke katl karne vaala dikhaaya he
 There was a lack of consciousness in him, he did not regret his actions but he did not even understand the importance of his extra humanity
 use na to manushya ke saath saahchary yaa mitrataa sthapit karnaa pasand nahin tha or na hi use kisi se pyaar yaa lagaav tha
 He considered himself superior and considered everyone inferior in front of him
 rolling ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vah " vastav main avishwasaneey dhang se takat kaa bhookha, naslvaadi" tha
 If he looked in the mirror mirror, he would see himself as "omnipotent and indestructible" as he wanted
 rolling ne yah bhi likhaa he ki vah vah apni maan va jaaduugarani meropi gont dwaara ek magalu va uske pita tom riddle par prem kaadhe ke falswaroop utpann hua tha, jo ek asafal pyaar kaa parinaam tha
 His mother dies due to the effects of decoction and the father leaving his mother, but if his mother had lived and loved him, everything would have changed
 vah aakarshan jiske kaaran tom riddle ke rup main janme balak kaa voldemort main parivartan hua vah bahut aavashyak he kyonki yahi vah sankalpana dikhaata he jiske kaaran is paatr kaa janm hua
 Like almost all the villains, Voldemort's eagerness causes his downfall
 vah mrityu se atyadhik bhay tha, jise usne sharmnaak tathaa ghrunit insaani kamajori bataayi he
 He had many signs of being egoistic
 apane praan bhakshiyon ke saamne voldemort ne yah mana he ki usne harry ke mata-pita par hamale kii badi keemat chukaai he, or phir usne yah avlokan kiya ki isamen kya galat hua or ant main vah ye dosha swayan par letaa he
 Rolling has written that his polymorphism would have been his last journey
 rolling ne voldemort or harry main antar bataate hue kaha he ki harry ne mrityu ko sweekaar kar liya tha is kaaran se vah ant main uski tulana main adhik taqatvar hokar ubhara
 Rolling throughout the series describes Voldemort as a highly powerful, intelligent and ruthless evil sorcerer
 vah dusro kaa dimag achche se pard saktaa tha or swayan ke dimag main ghusane se dusro ko roak bhi saktaa tha
 Apart from Dumbledore, he was the only known magician who used to be silent
 voldemort ek maatr jaadugar dambldor se darataa tha
 In the last book, Voldemort was shown flying without any support, anyone who read or saw this was taken aback
 apane purvaj gonton kii tarah vah bhi sarpon se sarpbhasha main baat kar saktaa tha
 He got this skill from his ancestor Salazar Slytherin
 gont parivaar swayan kii baatcheet main bhi is bhashaa kaa prayog karte the
 This extraordinary trait may have been genetically ingested in it, as this tradition was followed in the Gaunt family to maintain purity of blood
 jab voldemort navjaat harry kii hatya kaa prayaas karata he tab uski aatma ke hisse ke saath sarpbhasha main bolne kii kala harry main bhi chali jaati he
 When he dies in Harry, part of the soul, this power dissipates in Harry
 chathe bhaag main puraani kahani dekhne ke dauraan voldemort ne dambaldor ke saamne ek naukari ke saakshaatkaar ke dauraan daawa kiya ki usne "jaadu kii simaayen pehle se adhik badha di hai"
 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort's magical knowledge is far greater than any living sorcerer, and that even with Voldemort's return to full power, Dumbledore's knowledge of having the most powerful defense spells in front of his spells would be insufficient
 dambldor ne yah bhi kaha he ki voldemort sambhavtah hoguarts kaa sabase budhimaan vidhyaarthee he
 But despite Voldemort's unique talent and skill, he was unfit to withstand such powerful magic as love; No powers worked at this time
 puure shrunkhlaa main uski yah sabase badi jaadui ayogyata dikhaai gayi he
 Voldemort initially begins to doubt his magical powers, but after regaining his body and strength he confesses to his life-worshipers that he had ignored the power of Lily Potter's love that saved Harry's life
 
 rolling ne apni website par khulaasa kiya he kii voldemort kii chadi ek sadahrith vriksh se bani thi jiskaa ras jaharila tha jo kii mrityu kaa pratik tha
 It was thoughtfully designed with an axis similar to Harry's wand, made of an evergreen pruned bush
 ise unhone isliye chunaa tha kyonki sadabahaar kaatedaar jhaadi shatru se badla lenaa kaa pratik maani jaati he
 Rolling establishes in the book that Voldemort was magically associated with him through a scar made on Harry's forehead
 jab usne harry ko mrityu shraap diya or uskaa ulta asar usee par ho gaya, tab yah nishaan harry ke maathe par ban gaya tha
 In the book and films it is shown that Harry's mark was indicative of Voldemort's presence
 yah tab adhik dard karata tha jab anishtdev uske nikat hota tha yaa vah nirdayee yaa bahut khush hone vaala bhav darshata tha
 According to Rolling, at the time of the attack on the newborn Harry, Voldemort gave Harry a magical window of his mind as a forehead mark that no other magician does
 bahut se log voldemort ke paatr kaa kuch raajnneetigyon se tulana karne lage
 Rolling posited that Voldemort was "a type" of Adolf Hitler
 rolling ne voldemort kii tulana soviet sangh ke taanashaah joseph stallin se bhi kii he
 Harry Potter and Azkaban incarcerated director Alfonso Kuoran compared Voldemort to former US President George Walker Bush and former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein because they both had selfish interests and starved of power

 Sequence 1 Relevance in sports and development 2 Introduction 3 Benefits 4 Conclusions in sports and development Familiarity in sports is very important for the development of children
 bachche bahut kuch khel-khel main sikh jate he
 a child's development occurs through play when sports provide happiness to the child
 yadi bachche khel khelte samay khushi mahashus nahin karte hai to us khel se bachche kaa vikaas nahin hota he balki is tarah ke khel se bachche vikaas par galat prabhaav padataa he
 Sports helps in mental and physical development of children
 khel se baccho kaa purna vikaas tabhi sambhav hota jab bachche khelte samay tanaav mukt ho
 There are two types of games
 ghar ke baahar khele jane vaale khel
 Games played indoors
 jo khel ghar ke baahaar khel jate hai usase bachche ke shaarik aar maansik vikaas dono hota he parantu ghar me khele jane vaale khel se keval maansik vikaas hota he
 In my opinion, whatever kind of game is there to give happiness to the child, development is certain
 laabh khel kaa bacchaun ke vikaas main mahatvapurn bhumika hoti he
 Sports lead to oral and non-verbal development of children
 khel bacchaun ke shaarik or maansik vikaas madad karti
 Through the game, children learn to understand each other's feelings and respect each other
 khel se bachche ek-dusre se mil-jul kar rahanaa sikhte hai
 Sports help in social development of the child
 khel bachche ke aarthik vikaas me bhi madad karti he, kyonki kabhi-kabhi khel aarthik aamadani kaa madhyam ban jaataa he
 Through the game, the elder also gets to know about the child's interest
 khel bachchau ko anushaasit banane main madad karti he
 Sports create a sense of brotherhood
 khel bachche ko ekaagratha pradaan karata he
 Conclusion: The essence of this article is that the game has an important contribution for the complete development of the child
 khel se bachche kaa shaarik, maansik evam samaajik vikaas hota he
 Therefore, children should be given a lot of opportunity to play, but it should be kept in mind that whether children are feeling happy in the game or not
 yadi khel bachche ko khushi pradaan karata he tabhi bachche kaa purna vikaas ho paata he
 Parents must pay attention that the game is meaningful and is for the benefit of the child

 Google Scholar is a freely accessible web search engine that indexes the entire text of scholarly literature in various publishing formats and topics
 november 2004 main ise beta main jari kiya gaya, google scollar talika main europe or america ke sabase adhik vidvatapurna prakashkon kii sarvaadhik mitra-samikshit online patrikaayen shaamil hai

 In 2006, a citation import feature was implemented using Bibliography Manager in response to Microsoft's release of Windows Live Academic Search, a potential competitor of Google Scholar
 isi tarah kii suvidhaayen sitesir or sirus jaise anya khoj injano kaa bhi hissaa hai
 In 2007, Acharya announced that Google Scholar would be launching a program to digitize and organize magazine articles in agreement with its publishers, an attempt to break away from Google Books that included scans of older journals in specific marks Did not include the metadata required to identify specific articles
 google scollar upyogkartaaon ko lekhon ke digital yaa bhautik pratiyon kii khoj kii anumati detaa he, yah khoj online yaa pustakaalayon main kii ja sakati he
 The search "scholarly" will appear using references to "full text journal articles, technical reports, preprints theses, books and other documents including selected web pages that are deemed 'scholarly'"
 chunki google scollar ke adhikansh khoj parinaamon main sidhe vanijyik patrika lekhon ke link hote hai, adhikansh upyogkarta lekh sheershak ke sankshipt saransh ko praapt karne main sakasham hote hai saath hi lekh ke bare main nune maatra main mahatvapurn soochna ko praapt karte hai or sambhawatah sampoorn lekh ko praapt karne ke liye use bhugtan karnaa hota he
 Google Scholar is easy to use with regular Google search content, with the help of uniquely advanced search options that automatically reflect the exact search result for a specific magazine or article

 From December 2006 onwards, this publication provided a link to both the edition and the major Open Collectors but still did not cover posts from individual faculty web pages; Self-acquired non-subscription versions are currently provided by a link to Google, where one can obtain such open access articles

 "
 Research has shown that Google Scholar counts high, especially on quoted numbers and the citation includes words
 
 ek parinaam ke rup pehla khoj parinaam aksar atyadhik uddhrut lekh hota he
 Some searchers consider Google Scholar as a comparative quality and utility for commercial databases, even though their user interfaces are still in beta

 An important problem with Google Scholar is the secrecy about its coverage
 kuch prakaashak unki patrikaon ko crol karne ke liye anumati nahin dete
 2007 ke madhya tak algevier patrikaayen shaamil nahin thim, jab google scollar auki google ke web khoj ke liye apane adhikansh sciencedyrekt saamagree ko banane laga
 As of February 2008, absentee journals still include the most recent years of the American Chemical Society magazine
 google scollar prakashit vaigyanik patrikaon kii suchi ko crol nahin karata or uske adhyatan kii aavriti agyaat he
 So it becomes impossible to know how current or complete search is in Google search
 baharhaal, yah kuch sabase mahangi vanijyik database main kathinaaiyon ke bina prakashit lekh ke liye aasaan pahunch detaa he
 Google Scholar places considerable emphasis on quoted numbers in its ranking algorithm and is therefore criticized for reinforcing the Matthew effect: as multi-quoted forms appear in the top and receive more citations, while new papers might Only appear in the top and therefore receive less attention by Google users and receive less praise
 google scollar ko arxiv priprint sarwar par prakashnon ko sahi dhang se pahchaanane main samasya hoti he
 Internal punctuation in headings leads to incorrect search results, and authors are assigned the wrong paper, which is an additional incorrect search result
 yahaan tak ki kuch khoj parinaam bina koi subodh kaaran ke hote hai
 Google Scholar is prone to spam

 Therefore, he concludes that the citation number cited from Google Scholar should be used with security, especially when used to calculate performance metrics such as the H-index or impact factor

 This is an iterative method

 If this function is continuous at the interval and the signs of f and f are opposite, then a and b are called 'brackets' of the root because the origin will be somewhere in the middle

 India forced 93,000 Pakistani soldiers to kneel
 1971 ke pehle bangladesh, pakistan kaa ek praant tha jiskaa naam 'purvi pakistan' tha jabaki vartmaan pakistan ko pashchimi pakistan kehete the
 The people of East Pakistan took to the streets in protest against many years of struggle and atrocities of the Pakistan Army and suppression of the Bangladeshi
 1971 main azaadi ke andolan ko kuchalane ke liye pakistani sena ne purvi pakistan ke vidroh par amada logon par jamkar atyaachaar kiye
 Millions of people were killed and countless women were looted

 Thus the social and economic disparities found in two parts of the same country and the tendency of enlightened people to control the power itself led to nationwide dissatisfaction and finally the formation of Bangladesh in 1971
 pakistan ke gathan ke samay pashchimi kshetra main sindhi, pathan, baloch or mujahiron kii badi sankhya thi, jabaki purv hisse main bengali bolne waalon kaa bahumat tha
 Although there was never a lack of political consciousness in the eastern part, but the eastern part could never get proper representation in the power of the country and always remained politically neglected
 isse purvi pakistan ke logon main jabardast naaraazgi thi
 And to take political advantage of this resentment, Bangladesh leader Sheikh mujib-ur-rehman formed Awami League and demanded more autonomy within Pakistan
 1970 main hue aam chunaav main purvi kshetra main shaikh kii party ne jabardast vijay hasil kii

 On 25 March 1971, there was a massive massacre in this part of Pakistan under the leadership of the army and police
 isse pakistani sena main kaam kar rahe purvi kshetra ke nivaasiyon main jabardast rosh hua or unhone alag mukti vahini bana lee
 The Pakistani military continued to persecute innocent, weaponless people

 At the behest of the Pakistan Army, the Razakars, Al Shams and Al Badr tortured Bengali-speaking minorities and Bengali-speaking Muslims in erstwhile East Pakistan and fiercely violated human rights
 unke dwaara kiye gayi amanviya atyaachaar ke pramaan aaj tak bangladesh me samuhik kabron ke rup me milte rahe hai | After the massacres in erstwhile East Pakistan in 1971, several mass graves have been built, which have been known till date

 Massacres were carried out in all the areas from where opposition was feared
 Even people were taken out of the houses and fryed with bullets
 1971 main purvi pakistan main lakhon mahilaon ke saath balaatkaar, atyaachaar kiya gaya or hatya kii gayi
 According to an estimate, such excesses were made with about four lakh such women, who committed acts of forced sexual relations with them, women in military cant as sex workers etc
 and acts like gang rape
 563 bengali mahilaon ko kaint ilaake main kar rakhaa tha kaidaladai ke pehle hi din se 563 bengali mahilaon ko dhaka ke dingi military kaint main kaid kar diya gaya tha

 The entry of these refugees into India and the economic pressure on India due to this weight is also considered to be a reason behind interfering in this battle of India
 bangladesh kii azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan mukti vahini kaa gathan pakistan sena ke atyaachaar ke virodh main kiya gaya tha
 In 1969, discontent grew in East Pakistan against Pakistan's then military ruler General Ayub and was at its peak in 1970 during the movement of Bangladesh's founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
 mukti vahini ek chhapamar sanghathan tha, jo pakistani sena ke khilaaf gorilla yuddh lard rahaa tha

 Vasant Panchami or Sripanchami is a Hindu festival
 is din vidya kii devi saraswati kii puja kii jaati he
 This puja is celebrated with great enthusiasm in eastern India, northwest Bangladesh, Nepal and many nations
 is din striyaan pile vastra dhaaran karti hai
 In ancient India and Nepal, spring was the most desirable season of the people among the six seasons in which the whole year was divided
 jab phulon par bahaar aa jaati, kheton main sarson kaa sona chamakane lagata, jau or gehun kii baaliyaan khilne lagatee, aamon ke pedo par bor aa jaataa or har taraf rang-birangi titliyaan mandraane lagatee
 a big celebration was held on the fifth day of the month of Magha to welcome the spring season, which would have worshiped Vishnu and Kamadeva, it was called the festival of Vasant Panchami
 shastron main basant panchami ko rishi panchami se ullekith kiya gaya he, to puraanon-shastron tathaa anek kavyagranthon main bhi alag-alag dhang se iskaa chithran miltaa he
 In the early period of creation, Brahma created the creatures, especially the human vagina, by order of Lord Vishnu
 apni sarjana se ve santusht nahin the
 He felt that there was something missing due to which there was silence all around
 vishnu se anumati lekar brahma ne apane kamandal se jal chhidaka, prithvi par jalakan bikharate hi usamen kampan hone laga
 After this a wonderful power emerged from among the trees
 yah prakatya ek chaturbhuji sundar stri kaa tha jiske ek haath main veena tathaa doosraa haath var mudra main tha
 In both other hands, there were books and garlands
 brahma ne devi se veena bajaane kaa anurodh kiya
 As soon as the goddess sweetened the veena, all the creatures of the world got the voice
 jaldhara main kolahal vyaapt ho gaya
 The wind started rustling

 Saraswati is worshiped under various names including Bagishwari, Bhagwati, Sharda, Veenavadini and Vagdevi
 ye vidya or buddhi pradaata hai
 She is also the goddess of music due to the origin of music
 basant panchami ke din ko inke janmotsav ke rup main bhi manaate hai

 Kite flying has no direct relation to spring
 lekin patang udaane kaa rivaaz hazaron saal pehle china main shuru hua or phir korea or japan ke raste hota hua bharat pahunchaa
 As spring comes, every particle of nature blossoms

 Every day there is a new sunrise and after giving new consciousness, he goes away with the assurance of coming again the next day
 yon to magh kaa yah puraa maas hi utsaah dene vaala he, par vasant panchami kaa parv bhartiya janajivan ko anek tarah se prabhavit karata he

 jo shikshavid bharat or bhartiyata se prem karte hai, ve is din maa sharade kii puja kar unase or adhik gyanvaan hone kii prarthana karte hai
 What do the artists have to say? The importance that the soldiers have for their weapons and Vijayadashami, for the scholars, for their books and Vyas Purnima, for the merchants, for their scales, weights, books and Deepavali, the same importance is for the artists Vasant Panchami
 chaahe ve kavi hon yaa lekhak, gayak hon yaa vadak, naatakkaar hon yaa nritykar, sab din kaa prarambh apane upkarnon kii puja or maa saraswati kii vandana se karte hai
 Along with this, this festival also reminds us of many inspiring events of the past

 After the demise of Sita by Ravana, Rama proceeded south in search of him

 In the Dang district of Gujarat is the place where Shabri Maa had her ashram
 vasant panchami ke din hi ramchandra ji vahaan aaye the
 The forest dwellers of that area still worship a rock, about which they have the reverence that Shri Ram came and sat here
 vahaan shabari mata kaa mandir bhi he
 The day of Vasant Panchami also reminds us of Prithviraj Chauhan
 unhone videshi hamalavar mohammad gori ko 16 baar parajeet kiya or udaartaa dikhaate hue har baar jivit chhod diya, par jab satrahavin baar ve parajeet hue, to mohammad gori ne unhen nahin choda
 He took them with him to Afghanistan and burst his eyes
 iske baad kii ghatana to jagaprasiddh hi he
 Mohammed Ghori wanted to see the wonders of his elbow shot before he was given the death penalty
 prithviraj ke saathi kavi chandbardaai ke paraamarsh par gori ne oonche sthaan par baithkar tave par chot markar sanket kiya
 Then Chandbardai gave a message to Prithviraj
 prithviraj chouhan ne is baar bhul nahin kii
 The arrow that he had guessed from the injury on the pan and the sign of Chandbardai, hit Mohammad Ghori in the chest
 iske baad chandbardaai or prithviraj ne bhi ek duusare ke pet main chura bhaunkkar atmbalidaan de diya
 This incident also happened on the day of Vasant Panchami
 vasant panchami kaa lahore nivasee vir hakeekat se bhi gaharaa sambandh he
 One day when Mulla ji left school for some work, all the children started playing, but he kept studying
 jab anya bacchon ne use chhedaa, to durga maa kii saughandh di
 Muslim children raised the laugh of Durga Maa
 hakeekat ne kaha ki yadi main tumhaari bibi fatima ke bare main kuch kahuun, to tumhen kaisaa lagegaa? What was it then, as soon as Mulla ji came, those mischievous students complained that he abused Bibi Fatima
 phir to baat badhate hue kaaji tak ja pahunchi
 The same decision was expected during the Muslim rule
 aadesh ho gaya ki yaa to hakeekat musalmaan ban jaye, anyathaa use mrityudand diya jaayegaa
 Reality did not accept this
 parinamat: use talwaar ke ghat utaarne kaa farmaan jari ho gaya
 It is said that on seeing his innocent face, the sword fell from the executioner's hand
 hakeekat ne talwaar uske haath main di or kaha ki jab main baccha hokar apane dharm kaa paalan kar rahaa hum, to tum bade hokar apane dharm se kyon vimukh ho rahe ho? is par jallaad ne dil majboot kar talwaar chalaa di, par us vir kaa sheesh dharti par nahin gira
 He went straight to heaven from the skyway
 yah ghatana vasant panchami ko hi hui thi
 Although Pakistan is a Muslim country, kites are flown on Vasant Panchami in memory of the sky-high head of reality
 hakeekat lahore kaa nivasee tha
 Hence, the greatest emphasis of kite flying is in Lahore
 vasant panchami hamen guru ramsingh kuka kii bhi yaad dilaati he
 He was born in 1816 AD on Vasant Panchami in Bhaini village, Ludhiana
 kuch samay ve ranjit singh kii sena main rahe, phir ghar aakar khetibari main lag gayi, par aadhyatmik pravashtti hone ke kaaran inke pravachan sunne log aane lage
 Gradually, a separate cult of his disciples became, which is known as Kuka Panth
 guru ramsingh goraksha, swadeshi, nari udhdaar, antarjaateey vivaah, samuhik vivaah aadi par bahut jor dete the
 He too first started his independent postal and administration system by boycotting the British rule
 prativarsh makar sankranti par bhaini gaanv main mela lagata tha
 While coming to the fair in 1872, one of his disciples was surrounded by Muslims
 unhone use peeta or govadh kar uske munh main gomance thuns diya
 Hearing this, Guru Ramsingh's disciples were agitated
 unhone us gaanv par hamalaa bol diya, par duusari ore se angrej sena aa gayi
 So the dice of war turned
 is sangharsh main anek kuka vir shahid hue or 68 pakad liye gayi
 50 of these were blown up on seventeen January 1872 in front of a cannon at Malerkotla
 shesh 18 ko agle din faansee di gayi
 Two days later, Guru Ram Singh was also captured and sent to Mandalay jail in Burma

 Astronomical science refers to the study of the beginning, spread, sequence development and future of life throughout the universe
 vigyaan kaa yah kshetra kai kathin prashnon kaa jawaab dene kii koshish karata he, masalan - So far scientists have known only one planet on which there is life: Earth
 is vajah se keval isi ek udahaaran se prerit hokar vah aise anya sthanon kii kalpana karte aae hai jahaan jivan sambhav ho
 Recently discovered non-planetary planets have raised hopes of meeting planets in habitable regions other than our sun, which suggests that astronomy may possibly be at the threshold of a new phase
 "khagoljeev vigyaan" ko angrezi main "astrobyology" kehete hai
 By studying life on Earth, scientists have found a list of conditions that are compatible with life
 isamen carbon zaruri mana jaataa he kyonki iske parmaanuon main lambe-lambe anu banane kii kshamta he
 Although scientists imagine other elements to form the basis of life, but carbon plays this role very easily
 pani kii maujuudagi bhi zaruri maani jaati he kyonki isamen tarah-tarah ke rasayan mishrit ho sakate hai
 This means that for life, the planet should neither be so hot that the water should be in the form of steam nor should it be found only in the form of ice in the winter
 in baton ko nazar main rakhte hue abhi tak vaigyanik suraj jaise taron ko hi jivan-yogya grahon kaa rakshak maanate the, lekin haal main laal boune taron ke ird-gird bhi prithvi jaise grahon ke milane kii sambhaavnaaen dikhne lagi hai kyonki aise taare bahut lambe kaalo ke liye apane ird-gird ke grahiy mandalon main sthai paristhitiyaan rakh sakate hai
 This is a very important discovery because sun-like stars are found in a small percentage in the universe, while red dwarf stars are very large
 agar anya grahon par jivan carbon or pani par aadhaarit bhi ho, yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ke unke shariron main bhi koshikaaye hongi jinhen banane ke niyam prithvi ke jeevon kii tarah dillane par aadhaarit honge
 It is possible that those organisms have some other system base
 jaise-jaise prithvi par jeevon ke failaav ke bare main jaankaree badi he, vaigyanikon ko aisi jagahon par charampasandi jeev falte-phoolate hue mili hai jahaan kabhi jivan naa-mumkin samajha jaataa tha
 It was once thought that creatures could not live under the terrible pressure of the trenches of the deep sea
 yah bhi sochaa jaataa tha ke bahut adhik taapmaana main bhi jeev nahin rah sakate
 But in the last few decades, scientists have found water and gas fountains boiling from volcanic heat in the deep sea, in which extreme bacteria flourish
 khagolashastriyon kaa vishvas he ke saura mandal ke paanchave grah brihaspati ke prakritik upgrah europa kii barfili sataha ke neeche ek pani kaa samudr he jise brihaspati kaa bhayankar jowarbhata bal goonthta rahata he
 It is possible that there are also areas of such hot water and microorganisms flourishing in them
 isi tarah samajha jaataa tha ke khule antariksh ke vyom main or vikiran-grast vaataavaran main jeev nahin rah sakate, kyonki inamen unki koshikaaye fat jaati hai or unka dillane karaab ho jaataa he
 But now organisms such as Rhizocarpon Geographicum have been found that were transported to Vyom by the spacecraft and were found alive upon being returned to Earth after 15 days
 is se vaigyanikon ko ab yah bhi shankaa hone lagi he ke sambhav he ke jeev ulkapindon dwaara ek grah se dusre grah tak fail saken
 Some scientists even think that life on Earth may have come from another planet in the same way
 is kalpana main kisi anya grah par kabhi jeevanu rahen ho sakate he jabaki prithvi kisi bhi jivan se maharoom thi
 Then there was a big meteorite on Mars from which some big rocks of Mars flew into space and some of them also came out towards Earth
 jab yah prithvi ke paas pahaunchi to prithvi ne apane gurutvkarshan se unhen khinch liya or ve swayan ulkapind banakar prithvi par giriin
 Some of these bacteria survived, which found the Earth's environment favorable and started spreading
 anya vaigyanik is kalpana main bahut se nuks nikalakar ise asambhav kehete hai
 Controversy continues
 chaudak t, paati tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke champavat jile kaa ek gaanv he
 a hieroglyph is called a script that has expressions that convey meaning rather than alphabets that express sound
 yah bhavchitra aise chitralekh chihn hote hai jo koi vichaar yaa avadharana vyakt karen
 Some expressions are such that they represent something that even a person unfamiliar with that image can recognize its meaning, such as the चिह्न sign in the Unicode for 'umbrella' which can be identified by anyone who has seen an umbrella
 iske vipareet kuch bhavchitron kaa arth keval unase parichit vyakti hi pahchaan pate hai, masalan '' kaa chihn 'ishwar' yaa 'dharm' kii avadharana vyakt karata he or '6' kaa chihn chah kii sankhya kii avadharana vyakt karata he
 The Chinese script and the ancient Egyptian script are examples of such hieroglyphs
 "bhavchitron" ko angrezi main "idiogram" yaa "idiograph" kehete hai
 "hieroglyphs" are called "idiographic scripts" or "pictographic scripts" in English
 jo lipi aksharmala par aadhaarit hoti he usamen pathak ko keval kuch dhvaniyon ke liye chihn hi seekhney hote hai
 After adding these signs, the reader can read all the words in that language
 agar koi nayaa yaa aparichit shabd ho to uske akshar pard kar pathak use uccharit kar saktaa he
 In hieroglyphs, readers sometimes read hundreds or thousands of symbols to learn
 chini bhashaa seekhney ke liye yah zaruri he
 Nevertheless, hieroglyphs have a major advantage
 nepali or hindi donon main aksharmala par aadhaarit devanagari lipi prayog hoti he
 If a Hindi speaker sees the word 'atuva' in Nepali language, he can pronounce it but cannot understand that it means 'ginger'
 iske vipareet chini or bhashaa main prayog hone vaale 猫 chihn ko dekhakar chinibhashi or japanibhashi donon 'billi' kaa arth praapt karte hai lekin isko apni-apni bhashaaon main bilkul bhinn prakaar se bolte hai
 In Japanese it is read 'neko' and in Mandarin Chinese it is read 'mao'
 japan ke bahut se log chini kaa bina ek bhi shabd jane chini akhbaar padhakar us se kaafii arth nikalne main sakasham hai
 If they read the same newspaper in Chinese, they do not understand anything
 yah usee tarah kii baat he jaise ☂ kaa chihn dekhakar hindibhashi 'chhatari' kahegaa, angrezibhaashi 'ambralla' kahegaa or francisibhaashi 'paraplui' kahegaa
 For this reason, Chinese-speaking people are often able to understand them to some extent by seeing thousands of years old inscriptions found in China, because many images have been going on for a long time with slight alterations
 haalanki chini lipi main bhavchitron kaa prayog hota he, phir bhi bahut se shabdon ko in bhavchitron se sambandhit dhvaniyon ko jodakar likhaa jaataa he
 Often in words, a graphic gives some sense of meaning and another is helpful in making sounds
 isliye chini lipi vastav main chitralipi or dhwani-aadhaarit lipi kaa ek mishrit rup he

 quartodesiman vivaad, joki paskaal / easter ko lekar khadey hue kai vivaadon main se pehla he, tab is baat ko lekar uthaa ki paska kis tarikh ko manaaya janaa chahie
 The word "quartodeciman" according to the Hebrew calendar refers to Nisan 14 as a way of celebrating Lord Pascha or Easter Leviticus 23: 5
 According to the church historian Eusebius, the Quartodeciman Polycarp discussed this question with Anicetus
 The Roman province of Asia was Quartodeciman, while in Roman and Alexandrian churches, the fast lasted until Sunday, with Easter being associated with Sunday
 na to policarp or na hi enisetus ek duusare ko is bare main raji kar sake, lekin unhone is maamle ko tukdon main baatane vaala or sawaalon ko bina hal kiye chhodane vaala yani vichedakari bhi nahin mana
 Controversy arose when the Victorian bishop of Rome, who arrived a generation after Anicetus, attempted to excommunicate all the bishops of Asia for the Polycrates of Efesus and the Quartodeciman
 usbias ke anusaar, kai dharm sabhaayen is vivaad kaa nivaaran karne ke liye bulaai gai jinamein unke anusaar sab kii sab sabhaaon main ravivaar ko hi easter ke hone kaa samarthan kiya gaya
 While defending the antiquity of the Quartodeciman of Asia, Poliqurates wrote to Victor
 Victor's attempt to boycott was apparently overthrown and the two sides agreed to the intervention of the bishop Irenaeus who reminded Victor of the tolerant example of Anicetus

 It is not known how long the Nissan 14 tradition lasted
 But both sides of Nissan 14, and those who considered Easter on the following Sunday, had a common practice of seeking help from their Jewish neighbors to know when the month of Nissan would fall and their own
 According to the festival day
 teesri sadi ke antim hisse main kuch isaiyon ne is baat par asantosh jataana shuru kiya ki easter kii tithi tay karne ke liye yahudee samudaay par bharosa kiya ja rahaa tha
 The biggest complaint was that the Jewish community many times accidentally set the day of Paschal in such a way that it would fall before the spring-equinox of the Northern Hemisphere
 laodisia ke enatoliyas ne teesri shatabdi ke aakhri hisse ke dauraan likhaa: Those who decide the fourteenth day of Pascha by placing the first lunar month of the year in the first twelfth zodiac of the spring-equinox make a very big and extraordinary mistake
 elexandria ke bishop peter kii bhi yahi shikaayat thi
 On the fourteenth day of the month being observed with precision after the equinox, the ancient people celebrated Pascha according to the divine order
 jabaki vartmaan yug ke log isko ab vishuv ke pehle manaate hai or ye sab puri tarah se laaparvaahee or galati kii vajah se he

 Due to dissatisfaction with believing in the Jewish calendar, some Christians began to use independent computations
 But some people felt that the customary practice on the advice of the Jews should continue even if there is an error in its computation
 a version of the Apostolic Constitutions, which was used by the people of the Audiani sect, states that: aap swayan se apni sanganana mat karo, iske badale paska kaa avlokan karo jab parichedan se aapke bhai bhi yahi kr rahe hon
 agar wo galati karte hai to aapako koi fark nahin padataa
 Two other doubts, which led some Christians to object to continuing the process of determining the date of Easter from the Jewish Jewish society
 ye shankaaen, bishope kii anupasthiti main, nisiya kii sabha main, konstantin ne apane patr main vivakshit hai: It seems an unfit thing that we should follow the Jewish tradition in celebration of this biggest holy festival 


 It is within our power to comply with it if we abandon their customs, so that one By true order, the compliance of this legislation may be postponed in the coming ages of the future


 It is indeed a ridiculous thing for his own vanity to follow his instructions
 No we are not able to observe these things
 

 is prashn ke sahi samaadhaan se puri tarah se anibhigy hone ke kaaran, kabhi-kabhi ve paska ko ek hi saal main do baar manavaa dete hai
 The example of celebrating Pascha twice in the same year may have been due to the geographical diversity present in the Jewish calendar during that time, which was due to the large volume of communication broken throughout the empire
 The Jews of one city may have determined Paska differently from the Jews of another city
 The example of the Jews' "arrogance" and, indeed, bitter anti-semitism throughout this passage, suggests another issue: Some Christians thought it unbearable for Christians to decide the date of a Christian feast
 But let us depend on the Jews

 As far as the Roman law of the mid-4th century on Jewish affairs was concerned, this view did not get any support

 Template: Dates for Easter Easter and its associated holidays are dynamic festivals, in that they do not occur on a fixed date according to the Gregorian or Julian calendar
 Instead, the date of Easter is determined according to the lunar-solar calendar
 ye lunisolar calendar hebrew calendar ke jaisaa hota he
 In Western Christianity, Easter always falls jointly on Sundays between March 22 and April 25, according to the Gregorian calendar experiment
 agle din, easter mande, ko mukhyatah isai paramparaon vaale kai deshon main kanoonee taur par chuttee hoti he
 In the Eastern Orthodox Church which continues to use the Julian calendar to remove religious days
 is calendar ke anusaar bhi easter 22 march or 25 april ke bich ravivaar ko sanyukt rup se padataa he
 According to the Gregorian calendar, these dates fall jointly on April 4 and May 8, with a 13-day gap between 1900 and 2099
 purvi roodhiwaadee ke bich kuch girijagharon main julian se gregory calendar ko badal diya he or easter tathaa anya nishchit or jangam utsavon ke liye taarikh main pashchimi carch ke samaan hi he
 The exact date of Easter has been the subject of controversy at times
 325 main nisia kii pehali parishad main yah nirnay liya gaya ki sabhi isai easter ek hi din manaayenge he, jo paska kii taarikh tay karne vaali kisi bhi yahudee gananaa se swatantra rup se tay kiya jayega
 haalanki yah sambhav he ki taarikh nirdhaarit karne kaa koi tarika parishad dwaara tay nahin kiya gaya tha
 In the middle of the 4th century Epiphanias of Salamis wrote: parishad ke baad ke saalon main, alexendria ke carch dwaara nikali gayi sanganana ki pranali niamak ho gayi
 It took some time for the rules of Alexandria to be adopted throughout Christian Europe
 Whereas, the churches of Rome continued to use an 84-year lunisolar or lunar-sun calendar cycle from the late third to the 457s
 The Church of Rome continued to use its own practices until the 6th century while they could also adopt the rules changed by the Dionysius Exiguus to the Julian calendar according to the Alexandrian method
 Early Christians in Britain and Ireland also used the 84-year Roman cycle of the late third century

 From the 4th century onwards, the rule says that Easter is celebrated on Sunday or the first Sunday after the first full moon that comes after the day of the spring equinox
 However, it does not reflect the actual rules of the Church properly
 One reason for this is that the full moon in it does not really mean an astronomical full moon, but it is the 14th day of a lunar monthly calendar
 ek or antar yah he ki khagol vigyaan kaa vasant vishuv ek prakritik khagoleey ghatana he, jo 19, 20 yaa march 21 par pad sakati he, jabaki girijaghar main ye taarikh 21 march ko tay kii gayi he
 In applying the Church's rules, the Christian Church considers March 21 as the starting point for determining the date of Easter from which they then count the next full moon, etc
 The Julian calendar continues to be used by the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches
 unke dwaara roodhiwaadee easter kii tithi nirdhaarit karne main shuruaati bindu bhi march 21 he, lekin julian gananaa ke anusaar, joki gregory calendar main 3 april ko padati he
 Additionally, according to the Julian calendar the lunar table is 4 days behind the Gregorian calendar

 The actual calculation for the date of Easter is a bit complicated, but some times can be described as follows: easter chandra-saura chakra ke aadhaar par nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 The lunar year consists of 30 and 29 day moon months, which usually come in rotation, including an approximation month that joins after a fixed period to bring the lunar cycle into the line of the solar cycle
 
 isi hisaab se, grigorian easter 22 march se 25 april ke bich kii 35 sambhavit tarikhon par pad saktaa he
 The last time it was in 1818 was on 22 March and now it will not be on that date again until 2285
 In 2008 it was lying on 23 March but till 2160 it will not be repeated on that date
 Easter fell on the last possible date, and will fall on that date in the next
 The last time Easter fell on 25 April was in 1943 and the next time on this date it would be in 2038
 Whereas, in 2011 it will fall on 24 April which is just one day before the expected date

9% baar, jabaki an sabhi tithiyon ke liye ausat 189,525 baar yaa 3

 To prevent any differences in the date of Easter in the Catholic Church, the Church has created an Easter table, based on the rules given above
 sabhi sambhddha girijaghar in talikaon ke anusaar easter manaate hai
 a lunar-solar cycle is followed to determine the date of the Gregorian and Julian Easter
 yahudee paska kii taarikh tay karne ke liye bhi ek chandra-saura calendar kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or kyonki easter hameshaa ravivaar ko hi padataa he atah ye aamtaur par paska ke ke pehle din ke thik ek saptaah baad padataa he
 Whereas, according to the difference of rules between the Hebrew and Grigorian cycles, Pascha falls one month after Easter every 3 years in a 19-year cycle
 ye grigorian ke 19 varsh ke chakra main 3,11 or 14 varshon main padataa he
