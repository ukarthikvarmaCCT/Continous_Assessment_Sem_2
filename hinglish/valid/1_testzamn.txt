nagar ke dwaar par ek pattica tangi thi jis par likhaa tha ki vahaan kii rajkumaari kaa vivaah vikramaditya se hoga
 They reached the palace on the go
 rajkumaari unka parichay paakar khush hui or donon kaa vivaah ho gaya
 After some time they took some servants along and started towards their kingdom
 raste main vishram ke liye jahaan deraa daalaa vahiin ek sanyasi se unki bhent hui
 The sannyas gave him a garland and a stick
 us maala kii do visheshtaayen thim- use pahananevaala adrishy hokar sab kuch dekh saktaa tha tathaa gale main maala rahane par uskaa har kaary siddh ho jaataa
 With a stick, his owner could ask for any jewelery before gold
 sanyasi ko dhanyavad dekar vikram apane rajya laute
 Stayed in a garden, sent back the servants who came with him and sent a message to his wife that soon they would call him his kingdom
 udyaan main hi unki bhent ek brahman or ek bhaat se hui
 Both of them were taking care of that garden for a long time
 unhen aashaa thi ki unke raja kabhi unki sud lenge tathaa unki vipannataa ko dur karenge
 Vikram melted
 unhone sanyasi vaali maala bhaat ko tathaa chadi brahman ko de di
 Both were blessed to find such priceless things and went on to praise Vikram
 vikram raaj darbar main pahunchakar apane kaary main sanlagn ho gaye
 When the period of six months was over, then Purushartha and Bhagya came to them for their decision
 vikram ne unhen bataaya ki ve ek-duusare ke poorak hai
 He remembered the example of a stick and a garland
 jo chadi or maala unhen bhagya se sanyasi se praapt hui thim unhen brahman or bhaat ne purusharth se praapt kiya
 Purusharth and Bhagya left completely satisfied

 He started his studies at a local village school, teaching up to primary level and then continued it at Cav School in Hisar from the fifth grade
 unhen apane dada jagannatha goenka ke maargdarshan or sangrakshan ke tahat rakhaa gaya, jisane unhen jad se hi vyavsaay nahin sikhaaya, balki yuva ladke par bhi ek anant dharna chhod di
 After that, Jagannath Goenka had three primary businesses of buying and selling grain for a fixed commission, storage and money lending
 subhash apane rozaana shaam se waapas aane ke baad apane dada ke saath baithte the, or saikadon logon yaa graahakon ko patr likhane main unki madad karenge
 Under his grandfather, Subhash learned the three most important lessons of life: "have no fear, don't go back on your commitment, and don't stray from the path of truth
 " itnaa hi nahin, unhone subhash ko logon kaa vishleshan karne kaa bhi sikhaaya, logon ko apane vyavhaar ke jariye logon ke nazadik se nirikshan karne or unke iraadon yaa iraadon ko kaise jaane
 Subhash often used to go to the village market with his grandfather and gather and get all the information or gossip about the people
 isse unhen lagaataar apane kaan ko jameen par rakhane ke liye sikhaaya gaya aisi choti ghatnaon ne apane dada par bhi ek sthaayee sthaayee chhap chodi
 And the more Subhash was unhappy with his grandfather, the more impressed his grandfather was with him
 trivia: - unhen subhash chandra goyanka ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, lekin unhen subhash chandra ke rup main janaa jaataa tha kyonki unhone sochaa tha ki swatantra bharat raajnneetik pratishthan dwaara vibhajit kiya ja rahaa he
 Subhash Chandra's entrepreneurial journey! Phase 1 - Shubashree's entry Subhash always had a dream to succeed as an engineer, but destiny was a different store for him

 And finally, the company had to shut down! And to make matters worse, Bhai Jagannath and Inder Prasad decided to split the business and even though the business was about Rs
 kii kami thi
 600,000 at that time, he gave Inder Prashesh Rs 50,000 in cash with equal assets
 ab subhash parivaar naa hi diwalia ho gaya tha, lekin uske paas bahut se karj the jo apane doston or rishtedaaron ko die jane kii jarurat thi
 Given the unfavorable circumstances of the business and family, Subhash was asked to drop out of college as he could not bear the fees and join the family business
 alag-alag girane ke bajaay, subhash ne samasyaon ko jhukne se manaa kar diya, or ise saamne se saamana karne kaa faisla kiya
 Now at the young age of 17, with no other investment at all, besides 11 bucks in the pocket, it is certainly not an easy task to drive a bankrupt business but as they say - "when you have anything to lose Not found even when you really start winning! " So was his case
 1 968-69 main, subhash ko bhartiya khaadya nigam ke prabandhak se milanaa padaa, jisane is ladke ke liye pasand kiya
 Now FCI was used to supplier to the Indian Army, which was a big buyer of grains, pulses and dried fruits

 vexing ke vibhinn prakaar uplabdh hai
 Some of which must be done by a licensed cosmetologist or esthetician
 kiye ja sakane vaale vexing ke vibhinn prakaar ye hai: Waxing can be done on most parts of the body, but special attention is not paid to the parts not listed in the above list
 jin bhaagon par vyakti ko kabhi bhi vaix nahin karnaa chahie ve hai kaan or naak ke bheetar kaa kshetra or saath hi saath barauni, palkon, haathon kii hatheliyon or pairon ke talvon par
 in bhaagon kii twachaa samvedansheel hone ke kaaran yah vishesh rup se dhyaan dene yogya he or vaix kiye jane par yah gambhir rup se kshatigrast ho sakate hai
 Waxing has many benefits compared to other methods of hair removal
 yah ek baar main badi maatra main bal hataane kii ek prabhavi vidhi he
 It is a long-term effective method
 vaix kiye hue bhaag main do se aath saptaah tak bal waapas nahin ugenge
 jab bal ko hajaamat dwaara yaa ek lomanashaka kriim dwaara hataaya jaataa he, tab vah jadon ke bajaae twachaa ke upar se hatataa he

 Removing the waxing strip from the skin can be painful
 haalanki yah dard sthai nahin hota, yah vishesh rup se adhik samvedansheel twachaa par teevr ho saktaa he
 Another drawback of waxing is the expense involved: The procedure of waxing is usually done by a licensed esthetician, so it costs a lot to get it done, depending on which part of the hair is removed and how many treatments are necessary
 Can be up to several hundred dollars
 swayan karne vaale vexing bhi maujuud he, lekin sharir ke kuch bhaagon par use swayan prayog kiye jane main mushkil ho sakati he
 Hair removal is not permanent
 yadi ise baalo ke ugane kii vipareet disha main hataaya jaae, to yah mom pattiyaan rome chhidron main baadha daal sakati hai, jiske kaaran bal alag-alag disha main badhane lagate hai
 This causes hair growth to become more visible and makes it difficult for other methods of hair removal
 saubhaahgya se, sahi vidhi se kiye jane par vexing main jokhim naganya hota he
 Another drawback of waxing is that some people may complain of ingrown hairs, red swelling and slight bleeding
 aisa ghaney bal vaale bhaago par vexing karte samay hone kii adhik sambhaavna hoti he, vishesh rup se pehali baar karwaane par jab rome chhidr sakht hote hai
 While it is impossible to eliminate it completely, ingrown hair can be reduced with the following triangles such as by regularly upskilling and applying an astringent or a mixture of astringent and oil

yaad rakhen ast shani bhayankar peedadayak mana jaataa he, chaahe vah kisi bhi bhav main kyon na ho
? Numerology is also an important science in astrology, by which we can give a clear answer to the questioner in a short period of time, Saturn has got a score of 8 in numerology 
 shani paramtapasi or nyaay kaa kaarak mana jaataa he, isaki visheshta puraanon main pratipaadit he
 Calculate the date on which you were born, and if the sum comes to 8, then your auditor will be Shani Satchar

 a lot of hard work has to be done, but it is not possible to get as much as it is done, the natives become even lawyers and judges, and also make a living by doing business of iron, stone etc
 dimag hameshaa ashaant sa hi rahata he, or vah parivaar se bhi alag hi ho jaataa he, saath hi daampaty jivan main bhi katutaa aati he
 Therefore, people with eight digits should chant the first Vedic Mantra of the first Saturn
 After that, they should wear the Sapphire of five and a half Rattis
 By doing this, the person will progress in every field, will achieve his goal soon
 Will also be able to do this, as a result of which the Jhalak and the hereafter will be meaningful
 The Dhi is intelligent, is quiet by nature, and he can keep living in difficult circumstances difficult
 jataka ko loha se jude vayavsaayon me laabh adhik hota he
 Shani does not get to know the intuition of primeval people any time soon
 jataka ke andar maanav pareekshak ke gun vidyaman hote hai
 Saturn is clever, lazy, slow-working, patient with excess coolness, he is talkative due to being lazy, and sweet-spoken to protect himself from punishment
 daampatyjivan saamaanya hota he
 Even after working hard, money and cereal is reduced
 jataka na to samay se sote hai or na hi samay se jaagate hai
 There is always a worry in his mind
 ve loha, steel, mashinari, theka, beemaa, puraane vastuon kaa vyapaar, yaa raaj kaaryon ke andar apni kaary karke apni jeevika chalaate hai
 There are some loopholes in the Shani Pradhan Jataka, like if they wear new clothes then their shoes will be old, they will start to doubt everything, will do a lot of stubbornness according to their habit, most of the views of the natives are old
 unke saamne jo bhi pareshaani hoti he sabake saamne use ujagar karne main unako koi shame nahi aati he
 Shani Pradhan Jataka often contrasts his thoughts with his brother and brothers, he always lacks wealth, diseases always flourish in his body, due to being lazy, the car of luck comes and goes to him
 There is no identification, whatever money is given by the father is wasted in most cases

 shani ko santulan or nyaay kaa grah mana gaya he
 People who try to run their way through inappropriate things, which is not in the interest of society and try to give recognition to them, keep their own thing in the forefront because of the importance, unfair inequality, or unnatural equality
 He gives shelter, Saturn suffers them
 shani hamase kupit na ho, usase pehle hi hame samaj lenaa chaiye, ki ham kahin anyaay to nahi kar rahe hai, yaa anaavashyak vishmata kaa saath to nahi de rahe hai
 This is a planetary planet, that is, the body matures by performing austerities, the color of Saturn is dark blue, dark blue rays continuously fall on Earth from the planet Saturn
 shari main is grah kaa sthaan udar or janghaon main he
 Sun son Saturn holds sorrow over Shudra Varna, Tamas Prakriti, Tamas Prakriti, Vata Prakriti Pradhan and destitute inferior things
 shani seemaa grah kehalaata he, kyonki jahaan par surya kii seemaa samaapt hoti he, vahiin se shani kii seemaa shuru ho jaati he
 Understanding the difference between true and false in the world is the special quality of Saturn
 yah grah kshtkaarak tathaa durdaiv laane vaala he
 Along with misery, suffering, poverty, giving, there is a great teacher and teacher, as long as the creature is not out of the range of Saturn, progress in the world is not possible
 shani jab tak jataka ko peedit karata he, to chaaron taraf tabaahi machaa detaa he
 The native does not find any way to walk
 crorespati ko bhi khaakapati bana dena isaki sift he
 Good and good deeds increase the fortunes of the natives and increase their fortunes, whatever wealth or property the native earns, puts it to good use
 grihasth jivan ko sucharu rup se chalaayegaa
saath hi dharm par chalane kii prerana dekar tapasya or samadhi aadi kii taraf agrasar karata he
 If Karma is condemnable and cruel, no matter how destructive the fate of the lowly one will be, the Maha Kangali will stand up and stand still, will not even allow to die by giving it to the Bengali, the native's conscience ends soon after going against Saturn

 The body swells due to rheumatism in the body, and the hands and feet do not work, due to the accumulation of stool in the anus and the digestion of what is eaten properly due to the formation of hard stool, the soft part of the anal passage i get injured, and diseases like Bhagandar arise
 ekaant vaas rahane ke kaaran se sillen or nami ke kaaran gathiya jaise rog ho jate hai, haath pair ke jodon me vaat kii thandak bhar jane se ganthon ke rog paidaa ho jate hai, sharir ke jodon main sujan aane se dard ke maare jataka ko pag pag par kathinaayee hoti he

 shani aise rogon ko dekar jo dusht karm jataka ke dwaara kiye gayi hote hai, un karmon kaa bhugtan karata he
 It is Shani Dev's task to pay the full amount as the native has done
 shani kii mani neelam he
 The amount of iron in the body of an animal is more than all the metals, as the amount of iron in the body decreases, its movement becomes difficult again
 or sharir main kitne hi rog paidaa ho jate hai
 That is why the people born due to its iron deficiency do not benefit from eating the medicine, then the native should understand that Saturn is doing poorly
 shani makar tathaa kumbh raashi kaa swami he
 It is experienced in high Libra and in low Aries
 isaki dhaatu loha, anaaj chanaa, or daalon main udud kii daal maani jaati he
 Only three benches are considered to be main among the miraculous Siddha Peethas of Saturn, the person gets immediate benefit by coming down in these sins due to going to these Siddha Peethas and asking for forgiveness of sins committed by him
 jo log in chamatkaarik peethon ko kori kalpana maanate hai, uanke prati keval itnaa hi kaha ja saktaa he, ki unke puraane punya karmon ke anusaar jab tak unka jivan sucharu rup se chal rahaa tabhi tak thik kaha ja saktaa he, bhavishya me jab kathinaayee saamne aayegi, to ve bhi in siddh peethon ke liye dhundte firenge, or unako bhi yaad aayegaa ki kabhi kisi ke prati makhul kiya tha
 If there was no recognition for these Siddha Peeths, intelligent people would have been born like any number of them three and a half thousand years ago, and would have died while doing their own work
 People's recognition is the same today
 shinganapur gaanv me shanidev kaa adbhut chamatkaar he
 Till date no one has locked his house in this village, it can be guessed by this how greatness is in this proven back
 aaj tak ke itihaas main kisi chor ne aakar is gaanv main chori nahi kii, agar kisi ne prayaas bhi kiya he to vah foran hi peedit ho gaya
 Visiting, worshiping, oil bathing, getting Shani Dev done instantly reduces Shani sufferings, but he only reaches here, on top of which Shani Dev is blessed
 mahavir hanumanji ke dwaara lanka se fenka hua alokik shanidev kaa pind he, shanishchari amaavashya ko yahaan mela lagata he
 And the native hugs Shani Dev by pouring oil on him
 saath hi pahane huye kapadey juute aadi vahiin par chod kar samast daridrata ko tyaag kar or cleshon ko chod kar apane apane gharon ko chale jate hai
 Even after worshiping this Peeth one gets instant fruit
 logon kii hansi karne kii aadat he
 People who did not understand listening to the Pushpak Vimana of Ramayana used to laugh, unless they themselves see Rameswaram, stones can also float in the water, there is no faith, but when going to Ramkund Visited that stone and found it floating in the water, it could not understand anything except salutations
 jab bhagwaan shri krishna kaa banshi bajaata hua ek pair se khada hua rup dekha to samaj main aayaa ki vidwaanon ne shani dev ke beej mantra main jo beej kaa achhar chunaa he, vah agar rekhaankit rup se sajaa diya jaye to vah or koi nahi swayan shanidev ke rup me bhagwaan shri krishna hi maane jaayenge
yah siddh peeth kosi se chha: kilometre dur or nand gaanv se sata hua kokila van he, is van main dwapar yug main bhagwaan shri krishna jo solah kala sampoorn ishwar hai, ne shani ko kahawaton or puraanon kii kathaon ke anusaar darshan diya, or aashirwad bhi diya ki yah van unka he, or jo is van kii parikrama karegaa, or shanidev kii puja archana karegaa, vah meri krupa kii tarah se hi shanidev kii krupa praapt kar sakegaa
or jo bhi jataka is shani siddh peeth ke prati darshan, puja paath kaa antermukhi hokar sadbhaavna se vishwaas karegaa, vah bhi shani ke kisi bhi updrav se grast nahi hoga
yahaan par shanivaar ko mela lagata he
 The Jataka performs a Dandavat Parikrama in his own devotion, or does a Parikrama, those who revolve by reciting Shani Dev's King Dasharatha Stotra, or chanting the seed mantra of Shani, early attainment of good fruits
 It happens
 jyotish ke anusaar shani kii sadhesati kii manyatayen teen prakaar se hoti hai, pehali lagan se duusari chandra lagan yaa raashi se or teesri surya lagan se, uttar bharat main chandra lagan se shani kii saade saati kii gananaa kaa vidhaan pracheen kaal se chalaa aa rahaa he
 According to this belief, when Shanidev travels through the moon sign, it is considered as Sadesati, its effect is experienced from thirty months before coming to the zodiac and till after thirty months
 sadhesati ke dauraan shani jataka ke piale kiye gayi karmon kaa hisaab usee prakaar se letaa he, jaise ek ghar ke naukar ko puri jimmedaari dene ke baad maalik kuch samay baad hisaab maangata he, or hisaab main bhul hone par yaa galti karne par jis prakaar se sajaa naukar ko di jaati he usee prakaar se sajaa shani dev bhi har praani ko dete hai
 And not only this, those who have done good deeds, then also give sardhati prizes to them, such as being made the head of a city or village or the city, etc
 Sanyasati's narrative of Shani is received by many people, like King Vikramaditya, Raja Nal, King Harishchandra, also harasses Saturn's saintly saintly Mahatmas, who begin to indulge in Joga along with Bhoga
 har manushya ko tees saal me ek baar sadhesati avashya aati he, yadi yah saade saati dhanu, min, makar, kumbh raashi me hoti he, to kam peedajanak hoti he, yadi yah sadhesati chauthe, chathe, aathven, or barahawein bhav main hogi, to jataka ko avashya dukhi karegi, or tino sukh shaareerik, maansik, or aarthik ko haran karegi
in sadhesatiyon main kabhi bhuulakar bhi "neelam" nahi dhaaran karnaa chaiye, yadi kiya gaya to vajaay laabh ke haani hone kii puri sambhaavna hoti he
 Do not forget any new work, new industry, even in a half-century, before doing any work, you must get information from a knowledgeable astrologer
 Even you should not forget to buy a vehicle in this time, otherwise that vehicle Instead of being a vehicle of happiness, it will become a vehicle of sorrows
 We have seen in our last twenty-five years experience that how many industrialists in Sadhesati were in bad condition, and those who were crorepatis, they were road Then it started moving in a pot
 In this way, it was also realized that whenever Saturn is moving in four, six, eight, twelve, then its original wealth will be destroyed, no matter how much should be done
 If the idea of this time has already been done, then money is saved
 yadi saavdhaanee nahi barti gai to maatr pachhtaawaa hi rah jaataa he
 Therefore, every person should do the chanting tenacity and the laws that we will tell before the beginning of Saturn of this time
 To avoid the wrath of Lord Ravi, Ravana tied him with his legs in his captivity and turned his head downwards
 It was kept so that the curve of Saturn would not fall on Ravana
 aaj bhi kai hindu jane anjaane ravan kii bhaanti pratikatmak taur pe shani praturup ko dukaanon yaa vaahanon main pairon se baandh kar ulta latakaate hai
 Although the mythological suggestion is to do devotion to Shree Hanuman, because Shani Dev gave a boon to Hanuman ji that Hanuman devotees would not have a curved vision of Shani
 shanidev paramakalyaan karta nyaayadhish or jeev kaa paramahitaishi grah maane jate hai
 Lord Parayana beings who perform austerities after birth, at the time of penance, become ignorant and become impure by being ignorant of Maya, that is, they are not able to complete austerity, to fulfill the austerities of those ascetics Inspires to meditate again
 dreshkan kundli me jab shani ko chandramaa dekhtaa he, yaa chandramaa shani ke dwaara dekha jaataa he, to ucch koti kaa sant bana detaa he
 And such a person is disgusted with family attachment and gives disinterest by making a great saint
 shani purv janm ke tap ko purna karne ke liye praani kii samast manovritiyon ko paramatma main lagane ke liye manushya ko ant rahit bhav dekar ucch stareey mahatma bana detaa he
 So that his penance is successful in the present birth, and he can enjoy the joy of ecstasy and get the good fortune of the Lord Darshan
 shani tap karne kii prerana detaa he
 And Saturn places his mind in the divine
 kaaran shani hi navagrahon main jataka ke gyaan chakshu kholta he
 In the Skanda Purana, there is an account in the Kashi section, that Chhaya Sutra Sri Shani Dev asked his father Lord Surya Dev that, o father! i want to get a post that no one has received till date, o Father! My mandal is seven times bigger than you, i have seven times more power than you, no one can withstand my velocity, whether it is Dev, Asura, Demon, or Siddha seeker
 May the times be elevated
 i want to get another boon, that i should have direct vision of my deity Lord Krishna, and that i can be full of devotional knowledge and science
 Hearing this God of Lord Shiva Ury pleased and overwhelmed, and said, Son! i also want this, that you are seven times more powerful than me
 i cannot bear your influence, for this you have to meditate, go to Kashi to meditate, go there and go to Lord Shankar
 Tax, shani grah kii peeda se nivaaran ke liye paath, puja, stotra, mantra or gayatri aadi ko likh rahaa hoon, jo kaafii laabhakaari siddh honge

 Kamal Ataturk alias Mustafa Kamal Pasha is said to be the creator of modern Turkey

 Kamal Pasha was born on 19 May 1881 in a peasant family in Salonika
 inaki mata kaa naam juvaida va pita kaa ali raja tha
 Ali Raza was a clerk in Salonika's octroi office
 unka bachapan kaa naam mustafa tha
 The father died a few years after his birth
 mata jubaida ne majahabi talim dilaane ke uddeshy se madrase main daakhil kara diya jahaan unke senior chatro ke tang karne par vah marane maarane par utar aaye
 At the age of just 11, he had become so bad that he had to be removed from Maktab
 baad main unhen monastir ke sainik skool main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 But there too, his die-hard extremist nature remained, but due to his interest in military education, his studies continued unabated, there was no disruption in him
 balak mustafa ugr avashya tha parantu ganit main uski gati aashcharya janak thi
 As soon as he wrote a question on the black board of the teacher, he used to solve it by force
 usamen kamaal kii kaabiliyat dekhakar skool ke ganit adhyaaapak captain mustafa ufindi ne naam badal kar kamaal rakh diya
 Only then did he become known as Kamal Pasha
 17 saal kii umr main monastir ke primary sainik skool main praarambhik sainya shiksha praapt karne ke baad unhen kustuntuniya ke staff kalege main ucch sainya shiksha hetu bhej diya gaya
 In those days, there was the Sultanate of Abdul Hameed in Kustuntunia and his crown was called Sultan
 vahaan vah adhyayan ke saath-saath buree sangat main ghoomte rahe
 After spending a brief period of arrogant life, he became the first member of a secret revolutionary party called Watan and became its leader only a few days later
 vatan kaa uddeshy ek taraf sultan kii taanaashaahee or duusari taraf videshi shadyantron ko jad se mitaanaa tha
 One day the meeting of the party was going on that some intelligence gave news to the Sultan and all the conspiracy officers were arrested and sent to jail
 prachlit kanoon ke anusaar un sabko mrityudand diya ja saktaa tha, par durbalchitt sultan ko bhay tha ki kahin aisa karne par desh main vidroh na bhadak uthe, at: usne sabkon kshamaadaan dene kaa nishchay kiya
 Thus, along with other soldiers, Kamal was also left in pardon
 tatpashchaat sultan ne druj jati ke vidroh ko dabaane ke liye unhen damishq bhej diya
 There Kamal did a wonderful job, but according to his nature he returned to Kustantunia and after opening a room in Stambool, he opened the office of watan-o-hurriyat Party and started the work of the secret organization of freedom in it
 isi bich unhen yah gyaat hua ki macedoniya main sultan ke viruddh khulaa vidroh hone vaala he
 Sensing the exaggeration of the occasion, Kamal took leave from the Sultan's army and disguised as Jaffa, Mirua and Athens and reached Salonika, the center of the rebellion
 parantu vahaan par unhen pahchaan liya gaya
 Then he ran towards Jaffa via Greece
 par tab tak unki giraftaar kaa aadesh vahaan bhi pahunch chukaa tha
 An officer named Ahmed Bay had the burden of capturing Kamal, but since Ahmed himself was a member of the country, he instead of arresting Kamal sent him to the Gaza front and sent a report to the Sultan that he had not gone on leave
 Were
 yadhyapi kamaal salonika main bahut thode samay tak hi rah paye, phir bhi unhone yah bhalee-bhanti samaj liya tha ki salonika ko hi vidroh kaa kendra bananaa thik rahegaa, isaliye bade prayatnon ke baad san 1908 main unhone apana sthaanantaran salonika hi karvaa liya
 Here two years ago under the leadership of Anwar, a revolutionary party was established in the name of unity and progress committee
 kamaal tatkaal uske sadsy ban gayi, parantu dal ke netaaon se unki nahin baniin
 Nevertheless, he continued to do the work of the committee
 is dal ke ek netaa niyazi ne keval kuch sau aadamiyon ko lekar turki sarkaar ke viruddh vidroh bol diya
 Although it was a matter of great stupidity, but since the whole country was ready, the army that was sent to fight it also went to Anwar
 is prakaar desh main anwar kaa jai-jayakaar ho gaya
 Now the co-operative army was preparing to attack the capital
 sultan ne inhen dinon kuch shashan-sudhaar bhi kiye
 Even then the powers of the rebellion continued to work, but when the rebellion was successful, Sultan Abdul Hameed joined some of the army with enough bribe, which led the soldiers to revolt and kill their officers and once more Islam, Slogans of Sultan and Khalifa's Jai were raised
 in dinon anwar berlin main the
 He soon returned and he put Abdul Hameed on the throne and hanged several reactionary leaders

 In order to confound the general public, the Sultan's nephew was placed on the throne
 idhar kamaal pasha anwar ke viruddh nirantar shadyantr karte rahe kyonki unke vichaar se anwar beshak adarshavaadi the kintu avyaavhaarik adhik vyakti the
 Despite all this, Anwar continuously thwarted the foreign invasions that occurred at that time, this increased Anwar's fame in public
 iske baad anwar ne apane sarv islamic swapn ko satya karne ke liye kaary armbh kiya or unhone iske liye sabase pehla kaam yah kiya ki turki sena ko sangathit karne kaa bhaar ek german general ko diya
 Kamal started the movement against this, saying that this is an insult to the Turkish race
 is par kamaal ko sainik doot banaakar sofia bhej diya gaya
 Meanwhile, the great war broke out
 isamen anwar safal nahin ho sake, par kamaal ne ek yuddh main kustantuniya par adhikaar karne kii british chaal ko vifal kar diya or uske baad unki jeet par jeet hoti chali gayi
 Nevertheless, Turkey was defeated in the Great War
 kamaal din raat parishram karke videshiyon ke viruddh aandolan karte rahe
 Sevra's treaty was announced in 1920, but its conditions were so bad that Kamal immediately prepared an army and prepared to attack Kustuntunia
 isi bich greece ne turki par hamalaa kar diya or smarana main sena utaar di jo kamaal ke pradhan kendra angaara kii taraf badhane lagi
 Now a big problem has arisen for Kamal, because if they lose in this war, then there is no possibility
 isaliye unhone badi taiyaari ke saath yuddh kiya jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki dhire-dhire greek sena ko peeche hatana padaa
 Meanwhile, France and Russia also started secretly assisting Kamal
 thode dinon main hi greek nikaal baahar kiye gaye
 Only after exorcising the Greeks, there was a question of removing the remaining parts from the British
 desh unke saath tha, iske atirikt britain ab ladane ke liye bilkul taiyaar nahin tha
 For this reason this problem was also solved
 kamaal ne desh ko prajatantra ghoshit kiya or swayan pratham raashtrapati bane
 Now the state was almost dead, but there was constant opposition from the Mullahs
 isapar kamaal ne sarkari akhabaaron main islam ke viruddh prachaar shuru kiya
 Now the religious leaders have issued fatwa against them and started saying that Kamal has propagated modern dance in the country by taking women out of the curtains in Angora, in which men dance with women, it should end
 har masjid se yah aawaaj uthaayi gayi
 Then Kamal ended the Khilafat system in March 1924 and introduced a bill in Parliament declaring Turkey as a secular nation
 adhikansh sansad sadasyon ne iskaa virodh kiya, par kamaal ne unhen kasake dhamkaaya
 His threat was strongly affected and the bill was passed
 par bheetar-bheetar mullaon ke vidroh kii aag baraab sulagati rahi
 Many of Kamal's former friends were reunited with the mullahs
 in logon ne videshi poonjipatiyon se dhan bhi liya tha
 Kamal arrested his main leaders and hanged him one day
 kamaal ne dekha ki keval phaansi par chadhaane se kaam nahin chalegaa, desh ko aadhunik rup se shikshit karnaa he tathaa puraane reeti rivaajon ko hi nahin, pahanaave aadi ko bhi samaapt karnaa he
 Kamal made his first attack on the Turkish cap
 is par vidroh hue, par kamaal ne sena bhej di
 After this, they removed Islamic laws and replaced them with a new code which included all the good things of Switzerland, Germany and Italy
 bahu-vivaah gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Along with this, husbands were told not to treat their wives like drums and to treat them equally
 prayek vyakti ko vot kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Bribes were prohibited in services and severe bribes were given to bribes
 striyon ke pahanaave se pardaa uthaa diya gaya or purush puraane dhang ke pariched chhodkar suut pahanane lage
 An even greater improvement was that the Roman script was replaced by the Arabic script
 kamaal swayan sadakon par jaakar roman varna-maala main turki bhashaa padhaate rahe
 As a result, the whole of Turkey became united and the feeling of isolation ended
 iske saath hi kamaal ne turki sena ko atyant aadhunik dhang se sangathit kiya
 Thus the Ottoman caste became the modern caste due to Kamal Pasha
 san 1938 ke navambar maas kii 10 taarikh ko mustafaa kamaal ataturk kii mrityu hui tab tak aadhunik turki ke nirmaataa ke rup main unka naam sansar main suraj kii tarah chamak chukaa tha
 Although Kamal Pasha had four love affairs with four women in his life, but he married only Latifi Ussaki
 yadhyapi usase kamaal ko koi santaan nahin hui or vah nissantan hi mar gayi
 After Bibi's death, Mustafa Kamal Pasha never married

 vahaan 20 july 1921 ko gandhi ji or subhash ke bich pehali mulaakaat hui
 Gandhiji advised him to go to Kolkata and work with Dasbabu
 iske baad subhash kolkata aakar dasababu se mili
 In those days Gandhiji started a non-cooperation movement against the British government
 dasababu is aandolan kaa bengal main netritv kar rahe the
 Subhash joined them in this movement
 1922 main dasababu ne congress ke antargat swaraj party kii sthapana kii
 Swaraj Party contested the election of Kolkata Mahapalika to oppose the British government from inside the assembly and Dasbabu became the Mayor of Kolkata
 unhone subhash ko mahapalika kaa pramukh kaaryakari adhikari banaaya
 During his tenure, Subhash changed the entire structure and way of working of Kolkata Mahapalika
 kolkata main sabhi raaston ke angrezi naam badalakar unhen bhartiya naam diye gayi
 Families of those who gave up their lives in the freedom struggle started getting jobs in the Mahapalika
 bahut jald hi subhash desh ke ek mahatvapurn yuva netaa ban gayi
 Subhash along with Jawaharlal Nehru started the Independence League of Youth under the Congress
 1928 main jab simon kamishan bharat aayaa tab congress ne use kaale jhande dikhaaye
 Subhash led this movement in Kolkata
 simon kamishan ko jawaab dene ke liye congress ne bharat kaa bhavi samvidhan banane kaa kaam aath sadasyeey ayog ko saunpa
 Motilal Nehru was the chairman of this commission and Subhash was a member of it
 is ayog ne nehru report pesh kii
 In 1928, the annual Congress session was held in Kolkata under the chairmanship of Motilal Nehru
 is adhiveshan main subhash ne khaaki ganavesh dhaaran karke motilal nehru ko sainya tareeke se salaami di
 Gandhiji did not agree with the demand for complete self-rule in those days
 is adhiveshan main unhone angrez sarkaar se dominian states maangane kii thaan lee thi
 But Subhash Babu and Jawaharlal Nehru did not agree to retreat from the demand of complete Swaraj
 ant main yah tay kiya gaya ki angrez sarkaar ko dominian states dene ke liye ek saal kaa vakt diya jaye
 If the British government did not meet this demand in a year, the Congress would demand full Swaraj
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii
 Therefore, in 1930, when the annual Congress session was held in Lahore under the chairmanship of Jawaharlal Nehru, it was decided that 26 January would be celebrated as Independence Day
 26 janvari 1931 ko kolkata main raashtra dhvaj fahraakar subhash ek vishaal morche kaa netritv kar rahe the tabhi police ne un par lathi chalaayi or unhen ghayal kar jail bhej diya
 While Subhash was in jail, Gandhiji compromised with the British government and got all the prisoners released
 lekin angrej sarkaar ne bhagat singh jaise krantikariyon ko reeha karne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 Gandhiji spoke to the government to forgive Bhagat Singh's execution, but with tenderness
 subhash chaahate the ki is vishay par gandhiji angrej sarkaar ke saath kiya gaya samjhauta tod den
 But Gandhiji was not ready to break his promise
 angrej sarkaar apane sthaan par adi rahi or bhagat singh va unke saathiyon ko phaansi de di gayi
 Subhash Gandhi became very angry with Gandhi and Congress methods for not saving Bhagat Singh
 apane saarvajanik jivan main subhash ko kul 11 baar karawas hua
 First he was imprisoned for six months on 16 July 1921
 1925 main gopinath saaha naamak ek krantikari kolkata ke police adheekshak charlas tegart ko maarna chahta tha
 He accidentally killed a businessman named Ernest Day
 iske liye use phaansi kii sajaa di gayi
 Subhash wept bitterly after Gopinath was hanged
 unhone gopinath kaa shav mangekar uskaa antim sanskaar kiya
 This led the British government to conclude that Subhash not only had connections with fiery revolutionaries, but he also inspired them
 isi bahaane angrez sarkaar ne subhash ko giraftaar kiya or bina koi mukadmaa chalaaye unhen anishchit kaal ke liye myanmaar ke mandle karagrih main bandi banaakar bhej diya
 On 5 November 1925 Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das died in Kolkata
 subhash ne unki mrityu kii khabar mandle karagrih main radio par suni
 While staying at Mandalay prison, Subhash got very sick
 unhen tapedic ho gaya
 But the British government still refused to release him
 sarkaar ne unhen reeha karne ke liye yah shart rakhi ki ve ilaaj ke liye europe chale jaayen
 But the government did not clarify when they could return to India after treatment
 isliye subhash ne yah shart sweekaar nahin kii
 Eventually, the situation became so difficult that the jail authorities began to feel that they might not die in prison
 angrez sarkaar yah khatra bhi nahin uthaanaa chaahati thi ki subhash kii karagrih main mrityu ho jaye
 Therefore, the government released him
 uske baad subhash ilaaj ke liye dalhousie chale gayi
 Subhash was in imprisonment in 1930 when he was elected the Mayor of Kolkata in the elections
 isliye sarkaar unhen reeha karne par majaboor ho gayi
 Subhash was again imprisoned in 1932
 is baar unhen almoda jail main rakhaa gaya
 His health deteriorated again in Almora jail
 chikitsakon kii salaah par subhash is baar ilaaj ke liye europe jane ko raji ho gayi
 Subhash lived in Europe from 1933 to 1936
 europe main subhash ne apni sehat kaa khyaal rakhte hue apana kaary badastoor jari rakhaa
 There he met Mussolini, the leader of Italy, who pledged to assist him in India's freedom struggle
 ireland ke netaa di valera subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 The days when Subhash was in Europe, Kamala Nehru, wife of Jawaharlal Nehru, died in Austria
 subhash ne vahaan jaakar jawaharlal nehru ko santvana di
 Subhash later met Vitthal Bhai Patel in Europe
 vitthal bhai patel ke saath subhash ne mantranaa kii jise patel-bose vishleshan ke naam se prasiddhi mili
 In this analysis, both of them strongly condemned Gandhi's leadership
 uske baad vitthal bhai patel jab biimaar ho gayi to subhash ne unki bahut seva kii
 But Vitthal Bhai Patel did not survive, he died
 vitthal bhai patel ne apni vasiyat main apni sari sampatti subhash ke naam kar di
 But after his death, his brother Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel did not accept this will
 sardaar patel ne is vasiyat ko lekar adaalat main mukadmaa chalaaya
 On winning this case, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel gifted all of his brother's property to the Harijan service of Gandhi
 1934 main subhash ko unke pita ke mrityushyya par hone kii khabar mili
 As soon as he heard the news, he returned to Kolkata via airplane via Karachi
 yadhyapi karachi main hi unhe pataa chal gaya tha ki unke pita kii mrittyu ho chuki he phir bhi ve kolkata gayi
 As soon as he reached Kolkata, the British government arrested him and kept him in jail for several days and sent him back to Europe

 Subhash was attracted to Emily and the two fell in natural love
 naaji germany ke sakht kanoonon ko dekhte hue un donon ne san 1942 main bad gastin naamak sthaan par hindu paddati se vivaah rachaa liya
 Emily gave birth to a daughter in Vienna
 subhash ne use pehali baar tab dekha jab vah mushkil se chaar saptaah kii thi
 They named her Anita Bose

 Anita is still alive

 1938 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan haripura main hona tay hua
 Prior to this session, Gandhi chose Subhash for the post of Congress President
 yah congress kaa 51 vaan adhiveshan tha
 Therefore, Congress President Subhash Chandra Bose was welcomed in a chariot drawn by 51 oxen
 is adhiveshan main subhash kaa adhyakshiya bhaashan bahut hi prabhavi hua
 Hardly any Indian political person has ever given such an effective speech
 apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main subhash ne yojana ayog kii sthapana kii
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made its first president
 subhash ne bangalore main mashhoor vaigyanik sar vishweshwarayya kii adhyakshata main ek vigyaan parishad kii sthapana bhi kii
 In 1937, Japan invaded China
 subhash kii adhyakshata main congress ne chini janata kii sahaayta ke liye dow dwarkanath kotnis ke netritv main chikitsakeey dal bhejne kaa nirnay liya
 Later, when Subhash collaborated with Japan in India's freedom struggle, many people started calling him Japanese puppet and fascist
 magar is ghatana se yah siddh hota hai ki subhash na to japan kii kathputli the or na hi ve phacist vichaardhaara se sahamat the
 In 1938, when Gandhi had chosen Subhash for the post of Congress President, he did not like Subhash's methodology
 isi dauraan europe main dwitiya vishwayuddh ke badal chaa gaye the
 Subhash wanted that India's freedom struggle should be intensified by taking advantage of this difficulty of England
 unhone apane adhyakshiya kaarykaal main is ore kadam uthaanaa bhi shuru kar diya tha parantu gandhiji isse sahamat nahin the
 In 1939, when the time came to elect a new Congress president, Subhash wanted that someone who would not be bowed down under any pressure in this matter be made the president
 aisa kisi duusare vyakti ke saamne na aane par subhash ne swayan congress adhyaksh bane rahanaa chaha
 But Gandhi wanted to remove him from the post of president
 gandhi ne adhyaksh pad ke liye pattabhi sitaramaiya ko chunaa
 Kavivar Rabindranath Thakur wrote a letter to Gandhi requesting Subhash to be the president
 prafullachandra raay or meghnad saaha jaise vaigyanik bhi subhash ko hi phir se adhyaksh ke rup main dekhnaa chaahaten the
 But Gandhiji did not listen to anyone in this matter
 koi samjhauta na ho paane par bahut barason baad congress party main adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav hua
 Everyone believed that when Mahatma Gandhi supported Pattabhi Sitaramayya, then he would win the election easily
 lekin vastav main subhash ko chunaav main 1580 mat or sitaramaiyya ko 1377 mat mili
 Despite Gandhiji's opposition, Subhash Babu won the election by 203 votes
 magar chunaav ke nattejey ke saath baat khatm nahin hui
 Gandhiji, describing Pattabhi Sitaramayya's defeat as his defeat, told his comrades that if they do not agree with Subhash's methods, they can withdraw from the Congress
 iske baad congress kaaryakarini ke 14 main se 12 sadasyon ne istipha de diya
 Jawaharlal Nehru remained neutral and was alone with Sharad Babu Subhash
 1939 kaa vaarshik congress adhiveshan tripuri main hua
 At the time of this session, Subhash Babu became so ill with high fever that he had to lie down on a stretcher and bring it to the convention
 gandhiji swayan bhi is adhiveshan main upasthit nahin rahe or unke saathiyon ne bhi subhash ko koi sahyog nahin diya
 After the session, Subhash tried hard for a settlement, but Gandhiji and his colleagues did not accept him
 paristhiti aisi ban gayi ki subhash kuch kaam hi na kar paye
 Finally fed up, on 29 April 1939, Subhash resigned as Congress President
 3 may 1939 ko subhash ne congress ke andar hi forward block ke naam se apni party kii sthapana kii
 a few days later Subhash was expelled from the Congress
 baad main forward block apane aap ek swatantra party ban gayi
 Even before the start of the Second World War, the Forward Bloc started public awakening to intensify the freedom struggle
 3 sitambar 1939 ko madras main subhash ko britain or germany main yuddh chhidane kii soochna mili

 Subhash did not want to remain in jail during World War II
 sarkaar ko unhen reeha karne par majaboor karne ke liye subhash ne jail main aamaran anshan shuru kar diya
 The government released him as soon as his condition deteriorated
 magar angrej sarkaar yah bhi nahin chaahati thi ki subhash yuddh ke dauraan mukt rahen
 That is why the government detained him at his own house and kept him vigilant outside the police
 najarbandi se nikalne ke liye subhash ne ek yojana banaayi
 On 16 January 1941, he escaped from his house disguised as a Pathan, Mohammed Ziauddin, dodging the police

 Subhash lived in Kabul for two months in the house of an Indian businessman named Uttamchand Malhotra
 vahaan unhone pehle roosi duutavas main pravesh paanaa chaha
 Failing this, he tried to gain entry into the German and Italian embassies
 italian duutavas main unki koshish safal rahi
 The German and Italian embassies assisted him

 In Berlin, Subhash first met other German leaders such as Rieben Trope
 unhone germany main bhartiya swatantrata sanghathan or azaad hind radio kii sthapana kii
 Meanwhile, Subhash came to be known as Netaji
 german sarkaar ke ek mantri adam phon trot subhash ke achche dost ban gayi
 Finally, on 29 May 1942, Subhash met Adolf Hitler, the supreme leader of Germany
 lekin hitler ko bharat ke vishay main vishesh ruchi nahin thi
 He did not give any clear promise of help to Subhash
 kai saal pehle hitler ne min kamff naamak aatmcharitra likhaa tha
 In this book, he had done evil to India and Indian people
 is vishay par subhaashane hitler se apni naaraazgi vyakt kii
 Hitler apologized for his actions and pledged to remove that passage in the next edition of Mayne Kampf
 ant main subhash ko pataa laga ki hitler or germany se unhen kuch or nahin milane vaala he
 Therefore, on 8 March 1943, he set out in East Kiel in a German submarine with his partner Abid Hasan Safrani in Kiel Port, Germany
 vah german pandubbi unhen hind mahaasaagar main madagascar ke kinare tak lekar gayi
 There they both swam in the sea and reached the Japanese submarine

 Several days later Netaji gave a speech in front of the Parliament of Japan

 He himself became the President, Prime Minister and War Minister of this government

 Netaji also became the chief commander of the Azad Hind Fauj

 The Rani Regiment of Jhansi was also formed for women in Azad Hind Fauj
 purvi asia main netaji ne anek bhaashan dekar vahaan ke sthaayee bhartiya logon se azaad hind fouj main bhartee hone or use aarthik madad dene kaa aavahan kiya
 He also gave this message in his call - "you give me blood, i will give you freedom
" " During the second world war, with the support of the Japanese army the Azad Hind Fauj attacked indian colonial govt
 apni fouj ko prerit karne ke liye netaji ne " dilli chalo" kaa naaraa diya
 Both the forces won the Andaman and Nicobar islands from the British
 yah dweep arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind ke anushaasan main rahe
 Netaji renamed these islands "shaheed Island" and "swaraj Island"
 donon phujon ne milakar imphal or kohima par akraman kiya
 But later the British got the upper hand and both the troops had to retreat
 jab azaad hind fouj peeche hat rahi thi tab japani sena ne netaji ke bhaag jane kii vyavastha kii
 But Netaji preferred to walk hundreds of miles with the girls of Rani Regiment of Jhansi
 is prakaar netaji ne sachche netritv kaa ek adarsh prastut kiya
 Addressing Gandhiji through his speech on Azad Hind Radio on 6 July 1944, Netaji explained his reason for seeking help from Japan and the purpose of establishing the army-hukumate-azad-hind and Azad Hind Fauj
 is bhaashan ke dauraan netaji ne gandhiji ko rashtrapita kaha tabhi gandhiji ne bhi unhe netaji kaha
 After Japan's defeat in World War II, Netaji needed to find a new path
 unhone rus se sahaayta maangane kaa nishchay kiya tha
 On 18 August 1945, Netaji was on his way to Manchuria by airplane
 is safar ke dauraan ve laapata ho gayi
 After this day, they were never shown to anyone
 23 agast 1945 ko tokio radio ne bataaya ki sagon main netaji ek bade bamavarshak vimaan se aa rahe the ki 18 agast ko taihoku hawaii adde ke paas unka vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya
 Japanese general Shodei, Pilate, and some others aboard the plane were killed

 He was rushed to Taihoku military hospital where he succumbed

 bhartiya rashtriya abhilekhaagaar se praapt dastauez ke anusaar netaji kii mrityu 18 agast 1945 ko taihoku ke sainik aspataal main raatri 21

 After independence, the Government of India appointed the Commission twice in 1956 and 1977 to investigate this incident
 donon baar yah nateeja niklaa ki netaji us vimaan durghatana main hi maare gayi
 But these two commissions did not talk to the Taiwanese government on the land of Taiwan where the accident happened
 1999 main manoj kumaar mukherjee ke netritv main teesraa ayog banaaya gaya
 In 2005, the Taiwan government told the Mukherjee Commission that no airplane had crashed on Taiwan land in 1945
 2005 main mukherjee ayog ne bharat sarkaar ko apni report pesh kii jisamen unhone kaha ki netaji kii mrityu us vimaan durghatana main hone kaa koi saboot nahin hai
 But the Government of India rejected the Mukherjee Commission report
 18 agast 1945 ke din netaji kahan laapata ho gayi or unka aage kya hua yah bhartiya itihaas kaa sabase bada anuttarit rahasy ban gaya hai
 Even today, there is no dearth of people claiming to see and meet Netaji in different parts of the country
 faijabad ke gumnami baba se lekar chhattisgarh rajya main jila raigarh tak main netaji ke hone ko lekar kai daawey pesh kiye gayi lekin in sabhi kii pramanikta sandigdh he
 In Chhattisgarh, the case of Subhash Chandra Bose went to the state government

 The Calcutta High Court has ordered the formation of a special bench to hear the demand to make the intelligence documents related to the mystery of Netaji's disappearance public
 yah yachika sarkari sanghathan indiaj smil dwaara daayar kii gayi he
 Many others including the Union of India, National Advisory Council, RAW, Intelligence Department, Prime Minister's Private Secretary, Defense Secretary, Home Department and the Government of West Bengal have been made defendants in this petition
 hiroshima or nagasaki ke vidhwans ke baad saare sandarbh hi badal gayi
 After surrender, Japan kept groaning under America's feet for four-five years
 yahi kaaran tha ki netaji or aaazaad hind sena kaa romaharshak itihaas tokio ke abhilekhaagaar main varshon tak padaa dhul khaataa rahaa
 The trial of Azad Hind Fauj at Red Fort, Delhi in November 1945 led to an indescribable increase in Netaji's fame and he reached the peak of popularity
 angrejon ke dwaara kiye gayi vidhivat dushprachaar tathaa tatkaaleen pramukh raajnneetik dalon dwaara subhash ke virodh ke baavjood saare desh ko jhakzor denevaale us mukademe ke baad matayen apane beton ko ‘subhash’ kaa naam dene main garv kaa anubhav karne lageen
 At home, Netaji's portrait also appeared on the combination of Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 aaazaad hind fouj ke madhyam se bharat ko angrejon ke changul se aaazaad karne kaa netaji kaa prayaas pratyaksh rup main safal nahin ho sakaa kintu uskaa doorgaami parinaam hua
 The Naval Rebellion of 1946 is an example of this
 nausena vidroh ke baad hi britain ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ab bhartiya sena ke bal par bharat main shashan nahin kiya ja saktaa or bharat ko swatantra karne ke alaava unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin bachaa
 Except for the Azad Hind Fauj, there is no such instance in world history where thirty-thirty thousand war prisoners have organized and waged such a strong struggle for the independence of their country
 jahaan swatantrata se purv videshi shaasha netaji kii samarthy se ghabaraate rahe, to swatantrata ke uparant deshi sattadhish janamanas par unke vyaktitv or kartrutv ke amit prabhaav se ghabaraate rahe
 Swatantraveer Savarkar organized a conference of revolutionaries after independence and placed Netaji's oil painting on the seat of the Speaker
 yah ek krantivir dwaara duusare kranti vir ko di gayi abhootpurv salaami thi
 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has naturally been keen on writing in spite of his struggling and extremely busy life
 apni apurna aatmakatha ek bhartiya yatri ke atirikt unhone do khandon main ek puri pustak bhi likhi bharat kaa sangharsh, jiskaa landan se hi pratham prakaashan hua tha
 This book became very famous
 unki aatmakatha yadhyapi apurna hi rahi, lekin use purna karne kii unki abhilaashaa rahi thi, jiskaa pataa mul pandulipi ke pratham prishth par banaayi gayi yojana se spasht roopen chalata he
 Apart from this, Netaji wrote numberless letters in the context of his multi-dimensional freedom struggle, gave speeches and his lectures were also broadcast through radio
 patron kii ek badi maatra unke nijee jivan se bhi sambaddh he
 From December 1940 till the last time of Netaji, his full confidant and close associate Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose established the Netaji Research Bureau and started the massive work of publishing Netaji's 'samagra Sahitya' mainly in association with Vinod C
 Chaudhary in 1961 AD
 And in 1980, the work of compilation of 12 volumes of compositions began
 aarambhik yojana 10 khandon main 'samgr sahitya' ke prakaashan kii thi, parantu baad main yah yojana 12 khandon kii ho gayi
 Its first volume was first published in Bangla in April 1980 and in English in November 1980
 hindi main iskaa pratham khand 1982 main prakashit hua or phir in teenon bhashaaon main samgr sahitya kaa prakaashan hote rahaa
 Its final volume was published in 2011 AD; Although its contents were already ready
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke sankalan evam prakaashan kaary se aarambh se hi sugat bose bhi jude hue the or antim do khandon kaa prakaashan dow0 shishir kumaar bose ke dukhad nidhan ke kaaran mukhyatah sugat bose ke hi sampadan main hua
 In the first volume of this 'composite Society', some papers have been published along with his 'autobiography' and in the second volume his famous book 'struggle of India' has been published
 phir anya khandon main unke dwaara likhit patron, tippaniyon evam bhaashanon aadi samgr uplabdh sahitya kaa krambaddh prakaashan hua he
 In this way, as much as possible, written and textual reading of Netaji has become accessible for 'overall speech' study and it is an age-old requirement that like Mahatma Gandhi, in the context of Netaji too, to form an opinion based on many contextual statements and incomplete information
 Instead of looking at the appropriate issue in its appropriate and appropriate contexts, accurate and authentic opinion should be formed

 When Dev hears rumors about Paro, he immediately trusts him and leaves Paro
 jisase un donon ke bich shaq paidaa ho jaataa he or aavashyak rup se aisi purush bhaavana unke bich aa jaati he ki ek mahila ko kis tarah se yon aacharan karnaa chahie

 His love always turns into care
 duusari ore, dev usase pyaar se zyada-vishesh rup se shaareerik pyaar- kii maang karata he, ore yaheen par uski kismat uskaa saath nahin detii he
 Paro believes instead of separation that loving someone else is a cause for sorrow
 vidambnaa yah he, ki uski jindagi hameshaa mahilaon ke ird-gird gumti rahati he
 There is pressure on him to do his destruction from one and leave it by the other
 ant main use aihsaas hota he ki vah galat tha or shaayad usne kabhi bhi paro se sachcha pyaar nahin kiya
 He returns to Chanda and stays with her

 The word havayak means "those who can perform havan

 The terms of the loan are disputed but the sarpanch of the village gives the verdict in the interest of Sukhilala, under which Shamu and Radha will have to pay one-third of their crop as an interest of 500 rupees

 The Indus Valley Civilization is one of the major civilizations of the ancient river valley civilizations in the world
 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times

 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established

 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world

 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction

 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture

 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15
23 me
 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard
 sabase pehle kapaas bhi yaheen paidaa kii gai
 In the name of this, the people of Greece started saying this sign

 It was also exported abroad
 johari kaa kaam bhi unnat avasthaa main tha
 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai
 He was familiar with the wheel and probably used a vehicle similar to today's aces

 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic
 yahan swaastik ke chitra bhi mili he
 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
 jaise aaj hindu ganga main nahaane jate he vaise hi saindhav log yahan nahaakar pavitra hua karte the
