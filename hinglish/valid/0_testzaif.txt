 Atheism · Christianity · Hinduism · Islam · Judaism · Sikhism aalochana yaa samalochna kisi vastu / vishay kii, uske lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, uske gun-dosha evam upyuktatta kaa vivechan karne wali saahitiyik vidha he
 The beginning of Hindi criticism is considered to be from the Bharatendu era of the late 19th century
 'samalochna' kaa shabdic arth he - 'acchhee tarah dekhnaa'
 The word 'criticism' is made of 'luch' metal
 'luch' kaa arth he 'dekhnaa'
 The words review and criticism also have the same meaning
 angreji ke 'critisism' shabd ke samanaarthi rup main 'aalochana' kaa vyavhaar hota he
 The word criticism is also used for 'commentary-interpretation' and 'poetry-theory' as practiced in Sanskrit, but Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is clear that modern criticism is something independent of Sanskrit's poetry-theory
 aalochana kaa kaary he kisi sahityak rachana kii acchhee tarah pariksha karke uske rup, ganu or arthvyastha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has given the definition of criticism in these words: arthath aalochana kaa kartavya sahityak kriti kii vishleshan parak vyakhya he
 Criticism analyzes those elements of the synthesis of literature from the life and spirit of life
 sahitya main jahaan raagatatv pradhan he vahaan aalochana main buddhi tatv
 Criticism also assesses historical, social, political conditions and pupils and discusses their impact on literature
 vyaktigat ruchi ke aadhaar par kisi kriti kii ninda yaa prashansa karnaa aalochana kaa dharm nahin he
 Methodism and system are important in criticism for the interpretation and analysis of work
 aalochana karte samay aalochak apane vyaktigat raag-dwesh, ruchi-aruchi se tabhi batch saktaa he jab paddati kaa anusaran kare, vah tabhi vastunishth hokar sahitya ke prati nyaay kar saktaa he
 From this point of view, Acharya Ramchandra Shukla is considered the best critic in Hindi
 aalochana karte samay jin manyataon or paddatiyon ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he, unke anusaar aalochana ke prakaar viksit ho jate hai
 Four types of review are generally accepted: - saiddhanthik aalochana main sahitya ke siddhanton par vichaar hota he
 In it, ancient classical poetry - Rasa, Alankar etc
 and modern beliefs and rules of literature are mainly disseminated
 saiddhanthik aalochana main vichaar kaa bindu yah he ki sahitya kaa maandand shastreey he yaa aitihaasik
 The classical form of a norm is static and unchangeable, but considering the criteria as a historical category, their form is variable and developmental
 donon prakaar kii saiddhanthik aalochanaayen uplabdh hai
 But now the importance of the same theoretical criticism which assumes development in the historical process of elements and rules of literature
 nishchit siddhanton keadhar par jab sahitya ke ganu-dosha, shreshth-nikrusht kaa nirnay kar diya jaataa he tab use nirnayaatmak aalochana kehete hai
 It is also considered a type of moral criticism
 iskaa mukhya swabhaav nyaayadhish kii tarah sahityak kritiyon par nirnay dena he
 Such criticism often uses the principle mechanically
 isliye nirnayaatmak aalochana kaa mahatva kam ho jaataa he
 Although creating a sense of value or superior literature and inferior literature is one of the main religions of criticism, but it is not possible by mechanical use of principles
 'hindi sahitya kosh' main nirnayaatmak aalochana ke vishay main bataaya gaya he: Thus judgment in criticism is not the point of dispute as much as the method adopted for decision
 jasai, ramachandra shukla kii aalochana main mulya nirnay he, lekin uskaa tarika srujanaatmak he, yantric nahin
 Judicial criticism lacks flexibility in both value and method
 is aalochana main kavy kaa jo prabhaav aalochak keman par padataa he use vah sajile pad-vinyas main vyast kar detaa he
 Personal interest is main in this
 prabhavabhivyajunk samalochna koi thaȥk-ǒthakaane kii vastu nahin he
 Neither is its value in the field of knowledge nor in the field of emotion

 In this agriculture, the soil is dug up to a depth of a few inches, so that the soil below comes up and becomes brittle, influenced by natural forces like wind, frost, rain and sunlight and heat

 After that, plowing with any heavy machine, which cuts the soil and also turns

 yah kathor tah krishi ke liye atyant hanikaarak siddh hoti he, kyonki varsha yaa sinchai se khet main adhik jal ho jane par vah is kathor tah ko bhedakar neeche nahin ja paata
 Therefore, the soil is filled with water for a long time and many types of losses arise
 un haniyon se bachane ke liye us kathor tah ko prayek varsh todna atyant aavashyak ho jaataa he
 The magnitude of soil particles depends on the soil texture and their configuration on the order
 jutai se banaavat tathaa vinyas main parivartan karke ham mitti ko icchaanusaar shasy utpann karne yogya bana sakate hai
 In order to obtain high quality soil for sowing seeds, firstly a heavy plowing soil plow is used

 If there are large lumps then cylinder or pata is used, causing lumps to break
 jutai ke kisi yantra kaa upyog mukhyat: mitti kii prakruti tathaa ritu kii dasha par nirbhar he
 The final tillage should be done with great care before sowing the seeds, as the conservation of humidity in the soil is dependent on this final tillage and the success of seed freezing is dependent on this humidity

 These capillary tubes are made up of granular holes
 ye chhidr jitne chote honge, keshika naliyaan utani hi patali or sankri hongi or kanantarik jal mitti main utana hi upar tak chadhega
 The size of these holes and hence capillary tubes is appropriate or inappropriate depending on tillage

 In addition to running the plow, plowing, weeding, shoveling, digging, rolling or rolling etc
 are included in the plowing
 in sab kriyaaon kaa mukhya abhipraay yahi he ki mitti bhurabhuri or naram ho jaae tathaa paudhe ke safal jivan ke liye mitti main upyukt paristhiti prastut ho jaae

 Astu, the main objectives of traction are: jal, vaayu or taap main atyant ghanishtha sambandh he
 If the amount of water in the soil soil will be high then the amount of air will be reduced, the temperature will decrease accordingly
 iske vipareet yadi mitti adhik shushk he to taap adhik ho jayega
 These three essential conditions depend on the soil holding
 yadi jot uttam he, to mitti main jal, vaayu tathaa taap bhi uchit rup main hai
 If there is more or less water in the soil, best holdings cannot be obtained
 adhik jal ke kaaran mitti chipakane lagati he or aisi mitti kii jutai karne se jot nasht ho jaati he
 When the soil starts drying up, there is such a situation that if plowing is done at that time, then the best holdings are obtained
 matiyaar mitti jab suukh jaati he tab usamen dhele ban jate hai jinakon todna kathin ho jaataa he
 There are many types of tillage, such as deep plowing, shallow plowing, long plowing, summer plowing, halai or green plowing, mid-to-outer or edge-to-center plowing and from one edge to another
 
 har prakaar kii jutai main kuch na kuch visheshta hoti he
 Deep plowing makes the soil fertile to greater depths and is highly suitable for deep growing roots

 Prolonged and summer plowing destroys harmful insects and their eggs in the soil

 If the field is very large, then divide it by halai or harai law and divide it into several parts

 By doing this, the field gradually gets flattened and the soil also gets well burnt
 parantu yah kaary deshi hal se nahin kiya ja sata
 For this, the soil inverter should be solved
 isamen mitti palatney ke liye pankh laga rahata he
 This is the reason why the native plow cannot really be called a plow, because the definition of plow is the machine that cuts the soil and digs it up
 deshi hal se mitti katati he, parantu palatati nahin
 It is appropriate to call it the plow's excavator

 The plow produced should be thoroughly inspected

 While plowing, the hull of the plow should be held firmly so that the plow goes straight and to the required depth

 There is definitely a gap left in plowing with the native plow, which has to be plowed several times to finish it
 khet kii mitti adhik geeli yaa sukhi na ho
 Many pieces become hard covered with more wet soil and plow soil does not cut on dry soil
 usamen itani ardrata ho ki vah bhurabhuri ho jaae

 Mujhse Dosti Karoge is a 2002 Hindi language film directed by Kunal Kohli
 yah ruthik roshan, rani mukherjee or karina kapur dwaara chitrit kiye gaye teen doston ke prem trikon ke bare main he
 Raj Khanna, Pooja Sahni and Tina Kapoor are childhood friends
 jabaki raaj hameshaa jeevant or sundar tina kii ore aakarshith rahaa he, vah puri tarah se uske liye puja ke pyaar ke bare main anjaan he
 Raj's father decides to move to England for a new job with his family
 jane se pehle, raaj ne tina ko i-mail ke madhyam se use likhane kaa vaada kiya
 Tina is the popular girl and soon gets busy with other things
 isliye puja tina ke naam se raaj ko likhti he taaki tina apana vaada puraa kar sake
 Raj and Pooja have many things in common and their e-mails bring them closer to each other
 ek dashak baad, raaj ek choti chuttee ke liye bharat laut aata he
 By now he loves the girl he was writing to and believes he can recognize her at first sight
 jab teenon antat milte hai to wo puja ko puri tarah andekha kar detaa he or tina ke saath pyaar main ho jaataa he
 Tina is initially unsure but is also slowly attracted to him
 haalanki apni chhuttiyon ke do saptaah ke dauraan vah dhyaan detaa he ki vaastavik tina i-mail kii tina se puri tarah se alag he
 He also begins a friendship with Pooja and is impressed by her general interest
 lekin yah mahasoos kiye bina ki vah vastav main wo vahi he jisase wo pyaar karata he
 He returns to London where Pooja comes by chance to be interviewed
 raaj ek carch main jaataa he jahaan vah aksar jaaya karata he
 There she finds Pooja humming the same song that she likes
 use pataa chalata he ki puja vahi he jo un sabhi varshon main use likh rahi thi
 Because he shared information about that church and the song in an e-mail
 ve ek duusare ke liye apane pyaar kii khoj karte hai or shaadi karne kaa faisla karte hai
 Back in India, Tina's father dies suddenly
 jisase duniya main tina akele anaath ho jaati he
 His last wish was that Tina would marry Raj, which he expressed to Raj's father
 yah jaanakar ki tina ko bhi raaj pasand he or vah ab akeli he, puja raaj se shaadi karne se inkaar karti he
 Because she doesn't want to break Tina's heart
 raaj ke mata-pita bhi vivaah se sahamat hai
 Those people are unaware of the relationship between Raj and Pooja developed in London
 raaj apane mata-pita ko sach kehane par jor detaa he lekin puja use roak detii he
 He swears that he will marry Tina only if Pooja marries someone else on the same day
 rohan verma raaj kaa mitra he jo hameshaa se puja kii ore aakarshith rahaa he
 Pooja agrees to marry Raj and Tina on the same day
 vivaah ke din tina ko pataa chalata he ki raaj vastav main puja se pyaar karata he
 The film ends with Pooja and Raj's wedding

 To experience and understand the sufferings and emotions of others is called Anushubhuti or Samubhuti
 samanubhuti, asamanubhuti ke vipareet or udaseenta se bhinn hoti he
 In a sense of unevenness, a person is far from talking about understanding and feeling the pain of the people
 samanubhuti, udaseenta se bhinn hoti he, jabaki sahanubhuti se bahut aage kii bhaavana he
 In empathy, two aspects are found - one, the person with empathy feels the one who feels the other
 doosraa, samanubhuti vaala vyakti vah samaj saktaa he, jo doosraa mahasoos karata he
 The first component is called the emotional component that occurs in all beings
 jabaki samanubhuti kaa sangyanatmak ghatak keval manushya main hota he
 Only the human has the ability to understand the suffering or emotions of others from the perspective of another
 saamaajik manovaigyanikon, ke anusaar dusron ke kashton yaa sanvegon se pariprekshya grahan ke tareeke ko samanubhuti kehete hai
 Perspective credit is of three types - kisi vyakti ke man main samanubhuti utpann hone kaa ek tareek yah hota he ki kisi ghatana kaa duusare vyakti par parinaam kya hoga, isaki kalpana ke dwaara vah chizon ko samajhataa he
 It is called 'passionate Equality'
 kisi bukamp, aatankwaadi hamalaa yaa sookhaa kii aapadaa yaa traasadee se na guzarane vaale bhi jab aise logon kii madad ke liye aage aate hai, to ise anya kalpana pariprekshya ke tareeke par adhrith samanubhuti kehete hai
 The second way for a person to have empathy is to imagine how he would feel if an incident happens to him
 yah swa kalpana pariprekshya he
 For example, after seeing the occurrence of a flood or a storm, and trying to see what will be the result, it is a self-conceived perspective
 swa kalpana pariprekshya par adhrith samanubhuti main sahaayta kii pravriti teevr hoti he
 People express more empathy when they face the same type of disaster
 udhaaharan ke liye jo log pehle tufaan kaa saamana kar chuke honge ve tufaan se prabhavit vyaktiyon ke prati vishesh rup se pratikriyaatmak honge
 Those who have suffered landslides and floods will react more to the victims of floods than those who have not suffered such calamities
 garibi kaa anubhav jhel chuke vyakti garib vyakti ke prati adhik gahan samvegatmak pratikriya vyakt karte hai
 Fantasy is also a way to create empathy in a person's mind
 yah samanubhuti ek kalpit charitra, kalpit vyakti yaa jaanavar ke liye hoti he
 At the end of the Titanic shipwreck while watching the movie Titanic and watching the sacrifice for his girlfriend is a similar feeling born on the basis of Ronan Fantasy with the other characters in the film

 tantra, parampara se jude hue aagam granth hai
 The meaning of the word Tantra is very wide
 tantra-parampara ek hindu evam buddha parampara to he hi, jain dharm, sikh dharm, tibet kii bone parampara, daao-parampara tathaa japan kii shinto parampara main paayi jaati he
 In the Indian tradition, any systematic text, theory, method, device, technique or methodology is also called a system
 hindu parampara main tantra mukhyatah shakt sampradaay se judaa hua he, uske baad shaiva sampradaay se, or kuch seemaa tak vaishnav parampara se bhi
 In the Shaivite tradition, the speakers of the Tantra texts are generally Shiva
 buddha dharm kaa vajrayan sampradaay apane tantra-sambandhi vichaaron, karmkandon or sahitya ke liye prasiddh he
 The literal origin of Tantra is believed to be like this - "tanoti Triati Tantra"
 jisase abhipraay he – tanana, vistaar, failaav is prakaar isse traan hona tantra he
 Tantra traditions are found in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain philosophies
 yahan par tantra sadhana se abhipraay "guhya yaa gudh saadhnaaon" se kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The Tantras are considered to be a post-vedic work that flourished around the middle of the first millennium
 sahityak rup main jis prakaar puraana granth madhyayug kii darshanik-dharmik rachanaayen maane jate hai usee prakaar tantron main pracheen-akhyan, kathanak aadi kaa samavesh hota he
 In terms of its content, these can also be called encyclopaedia of religion, philosophy, creation, ancient science etc
 europea vidwaanon ne apane upanivishvadi lakshyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue tantra ko 'gudh sadhana' yaa 'sampradayik karmkand' bataakar bhatakaane kii koshish kii he
 By the way, the number of books is thousands, but the main systems are 64
 tantra kaa prabhaav vishwa str par he
 Evidence of this is the scriptures of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Tibetan etc
 religions
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi bengal, bihar or rajasthan tantra ke garh rahe hai
 This scripture is divided into three parts - agam, yamal and main tantra
 vaarahi tantra ke anusaar jisamen sristi, pralay, devataaon kii puja, sab kaaryon ke sadhana, purashcharan, shatkarm- saadhan or chaar prakaar ke dhyanyog kaa varnan ho, use aagam kehete hai
 In which the description of creation, astrology, daily work, order, sutra, varbheda and Yugadharma is called Yamal
 or jisamen sristi, lat, mantranirnay, devataaon, ke santhaan, yantranirnay, tirth, ashram, dharm, kalp, jyotish santhaan, vrath-katha, shouch or ashauch, stri-purush-lakshan, rajdharm, daan- dharm, yuvadharm, vyavhaar tathaa aadhyatmik vishyon kaa varnan ho, vah tantra kehalaata he 
 The theory of this scripture is that in Kali Yuga there is no result of Vedic mantras, chants and yagyas etc
 is yug main sab prakaar ke kaaryon kii siddhi ke liye tantrashaastra main varnit mantron or upayon aadi se hi sahaayta milti he 
 The principles of this scripture are kept very secret and a man has to be initiated first to take his teachings
 aajkal praayah maaran, ucchatan, vaseekaran aadi ke liye tathaa anek prakaar kii siddhiyon aadi ke saadhan ke liye hi tantrokt mantron or kriyaaon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 This scripture is primarily of the devotees and its mantras are often meaningless and monolithic
 jaise,— hnin, clin, shrin, sthin, shun, kru aadi 
 The Panchamakara of Tantrikas - alcohol, meat, fish, mudra and maithun - and Chakrapooja are famous
 tantric sab devataaon kaa pujan karte hai par unki puja kaa vidhaan sabase bhinn or swatantra hota he 
 In Chakrapuja and many other pujas, tantric people treat alcohol, meat and fish in a great manner and worship women like Dhobin, Tallin etc
 naked
 yadhyapi atharvaveda samhita main maaran, mohan, ucchatan or vaseekaran aadi kaa varnan or vidhana he tathaapi aadhunik tantra kaa uske saath koi sambandh nahin hai 
 Some believe that modern system has been propagated in India during and after Kanishka's time
 chini yatri phahiyaan or huensang ne apane lekhon main is shaastra kaa koi ullekh nahin kiya he 
 Although it cannot be said with certainty when Tantra was propagated, there is no doubt that it is not older than 4th or 5th century AD
 hinduon kii dekhadekhi baudhon main bhi tantra kaa prachaar hua or tatsambandhi anek granth bane 
 Hindu tantrik calls them 'upatantar'
 unka prachaar tibet tathaa china main he 
 It is also written in Varahi Tantra that sages like Jaimini, Kapil, Narada, Garga, Pulastya, Bhrigu, Venus, Jupiter etc
 have also created many subsystems
 vyakaran shaastra ke anusaar 'tantra' shabd ‘tan’ dhaatu se bana he jiskaa arth he 'vistaar'
 It is interpreted in the 'kaayak Agam' of Shaiva Siddhanta, Tanyate Vyashyate Gyanam Anen, Iti Tantram tantra kii nirukti ‘tan’ or ‘trai’, in donon dhaatuon ke yoga se siddh hoti he
 This means that the system, in its overall sense, extends the knowledge as well as conducts those who conduct it
 tantra-shaastra kaa ek naam 'aagam shaastra' bhi he
 It is said about this- vachaspati mishra ne yoga bhashya kii tatvavaisharadi vyakhya main 'aagam' shabd kaa arth karte hue likhaa he ki jisase abhyuday or nickshreyas ke upaay buddhi main aate hai, vah 'aagam' kehalaata he
 Another form of the scriptures is called ‘nigam’
 nigam ke antargat veda, puraana, upanishad aadi aate hai
 It deals with knowledge, karma and worship etc
 isiilie veda-shastron ko nigam kehete hai
 The scripture which describes the form of remedies used to practice that form, is called 'agam'
 tantra athwa aagam main vyavhaar paksh hi mukhya he
 The system emphasizes actions and rituals
 ‘vaarahi tantra’ main is shaastra ke jo saat lakshan bataae hai, unamem vyavhaar hi mukhya he
 These seven traits are- tantra kaa saamaanya arth he 'vidhi' yaa 'upaay'
 There is no principle or method
 siddhanton ko lekar matbhed ho sakate hai
 Deities and disputes may also occur, but there is no disagreement regarding the law
 doobane se bachane ke liye tairkar hi aana padegaa
 If you want electricity, you will have to convert coal and water molecules
 daudane ke liye paanv aage badhaane hi honge
 If you want to climb a mountain, there is no choice without stepping towards the height
 yah kriyaayein 'vidhi' kehalaati hai
 The practicality is main in a system or prophecy
 tantra kii drushti main sharir pradhan nimitt he
 Without it the higher peaks of consciousness cannot be reached
 isi kaaran se tantra kaa taatpary ‘tan’ ke madhyam se aatma kaa ’traan’ yaa apane aapkaa uddhaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 This meaning is true only to a extent
 vastav main tantra sadhana main sharir, man or kaay kalevar ke sookshmatam staron kaa samanvit upyog hota he
 It is certainly true that the system gives as much importance to the body as to the mind, intellect and mind
 karmkand or puja-upasna ke tareeke sabhi dharmon main alag-alag hai, par tantra ke sambandh main sabhi ekamat hai
 All religions believe that eternal energy is hidden within the human being, only five-seven percent of it comes into use, the remaining part remains unused
 sabhi dharm–sampradaay is baat ko ek mat se sweekaar karte hai va apane hisaab se us bhaag kaa maarg bhi bataate hai
 Followers of those religions often employ similar methods to awaken their hidden powers
 unamem jap, dhyaan, ekaagratha kaa abhyaas or sharirgat urja kaa saghan upyog shaamil hota he
 This is the representation of the system
 tantrokt matanusaar mantron ke dwaara yantra ke madhyam se bhagwaan kii upasna kii jaati he
 To clarify the subject, even if the scripture talks about the principle, otherwise three quarters of the Agama-scriptures teach only the methods
 tantra ke sabhi granth shiv or parvati ke samvaad ke antargat hi prakat hai
 Goddess Parvati questions and Shiva preaches a method while answering them
 adhikansh prashn samasyapradhan hi hai
 Even if a question has been asked in relation to the theory, Shiva describes the method only after giving his answer in few words
 aagam shaastra ke anusaar 'karnaa' hi jaananaa he, anya koi 'jaananaa' gyaan kii paribhaasha main nahin aata
 There is no answer or solution until something is done, not entered into cultivation
 tantron kii vishay vastu ko mote taur par nimna taur par batalaaya ja saktaa he- The influence of both the Samkhya and the Advaita thought of Vedanta is reflected in the Tantra texts
 tantra main prakruti ke saath shiv, advait donon kii baat kii gayi he
 But special emphasis has been laid on 'shakti' in Tantra philosophy
 tantra kii teen paramparaayen maani jaati hai – There are four ideologies of Shaiva Agams - bhartiya parampara main aagmon kaa atyant mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Ancient temples, statues, buildings, and religious-spiritual methods have been determined by them
 pracheen taur par shaiva siddhanth ke antargat 28 aagam tathaa 150 upagamon ko mana gaya he
 According to Shaivism, in principle, Shiva is the only conscious element and nature is the root element
 shiv kaa muladhar shakti hi he
 It is through strength that one attains bondage and salvation
 pramukh granth shivasutra he
 In this, the attainment of knowledge is said to be done only by Shiva's affidavit
 jagat shiv kii abhivyakti he tathaa shiv kii hi shakti se utpann yaa sambhav he
 This philosophy is also called 'trik' philosophy because it accepts the existence of Shiva, Shakti and Jiva three
 is darshan kaa mahatpurna granth “vachanam” he jisase abhipraay he ‘shiv kii ukti’
 This philosophy considers traditional and Shiva completely all factors, destroyers, initiators
 isamen jatigat bhedbhaav ko bhi nahin mana gaya he
 The Guru tradition has special significance under this philosophy
 aagam kaa mukhya lakshya 'kriya' ke upar he, tathaapi gyaan kaa bhi vivaran yahan kam nahin he
 According to 'varahitantra' Agama is conferred with these seven traits: creation, status, holocaust, devartharna, omnipotent, purcharan, shaktarma, means and meditation
 'mahanirvana' tantra ke anusaar kaliyug main praani medhya tathaa amedhya ke vichaaron se bahudhaa hin hote hai or inhen ke kalyanarth bhagwaan maheshwar ne aagmon kaa upadesh parvati ko swayan diya
 In terms of Shaiva Agam dvaita, Shaktivishtvaita and Advaita, three distinctions are also considered
 aagmik puja vishuddh tathaa pavitra bhartiya he
 28 Shaivagam is known as Siddhanta
 'bhairav aagam' sankhya main chaunsath sabhi mulat: shaivagam hai
 It discusses from dvaita bhava to supreme advaita bhava
 kirnagam, main likhaa he ki, vishwasristi ke ananthar parameshwar ne sabase pehle mahagyaan kaa sanchaar karne ke liye das shaivo kaa prakat karke unamem se prayek ko unke avibhakt mahagyaan kaa ek ek ansh pradaan kiya
 This undivided great knowledge is called Shaivagam
 veda jaise vastav main ek he or akhand mahagyaan swaroop he, parantu vibhakt hokar teen athwa chaar roopon main prakat hua he, usee prakaar mul shivagam bhi vastut: ek hone par bhi vibhakt hokar 28 aagmon ke rup main prasidv hua he
 Each of these Agamadhara has a tradition
 vaishnav samhita kii do vichaardhaarayen milti hai – vaikhanas samhita, tathaa pancharaatr samhita
 Vaikhanas Samhita - This is the Vaikhanas ideology of the Vaishnava tradition
 vaikhanas parampara praathmik taur par tapas evam saadhan parak parampara rahi he
 Pancharatra Samhita - Pancharatra means 'system of Panchanishas'
 pancharaatr parampara prachintaur par vishwa ke udbhav, sristi rachana aadi ke vivechan ko samahit karti he
 It shows the incorporation of the beliefs of Sankhya and Yoga philosophies
 vaikhanas parampara kii apeksha pancharaatr parampara adhik lokprachlan main rahi he
 It has been said to have 108 texts
 vaishnav parampara main bhakthi vaadi vichaardhaara ke atirikt shakti kaa siddhanth bhi samahit he

 abhiklitr kaarykram vah nirdesh yaa kai nirdeshon kaa samooh hota he jinka prayong abhiklitr se kisi nishchit samay par koi kaary sampann karaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It is also called software program or just program or source code
 program kaa prayog microprocesar main kisi soochna cokriyanvit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 So that the processor can work as per the requirement of the user
 iskaa nirmaan kaarykram bhashaa jaise kii si++ aadi main kiya jaataa he
 Just as using any language can give any kind of instruction to another person, similarly using the program language, the computer can be instructed to do some kind of work
 sabhi kaarykram bhashaaon kaa ek nishchit praaroop hota he, jiske anusaar hi usamen strot sanket kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 Any change in this format may not give the source signal a definite result
 kaarykram bhashaaon kaa vargeekaran mukhyatah do samoohon main kiya gaya he - 1 nimna stariy bhashaa or 2
 ucch stareey bhashaa
 This group includes program languages that either do not use any translator or simply use the assembler to transmit instructions to the processor
 nim stareey bhashaaon main likhaa gaya code mul rup main hi kriyanit hone ke liye purnat: upyukt hota he
 At the same time it takes minimum memory and takes minimum time to execute
 inkaa kriyanyayan jitna saral he
 It is equally difficult to use them as it is necessary for the user of low-level languages to be fully proficient in the tasks related to computer devices
 saath hi saath is bhashaa main strot sanket kaa nirmaan karne main samay bhi adhik lagata he
 Therefore low level languages may be suitable for small programs, but it is very difficult to use them to produce big programs
 nimna stareey bhashaaon ko do virgon main vibhajit kiya gaya he: mashin stareey bhashaa tathaa asembli bhashaayen
 The process of creating a computer program takes several steps
 vidyut kaa upyog bahut samay se hota aa rahaa he or nirantar anveshan kaary ke falswaroop aaj ke yug main anek prakaar ke vidyut upkarnon kaa prayog hone laga he
 For current to flow in a conductor it is necessary that there is some difference between the two ends of the conductor which is measured in volts
 vidyut dhara ke maapne kii ikai ampiore he
 When this current flows in a conductor, two types of effects are seen: dhara ke ye sabhi prabhaav dharaman maapne kii vidhiyon main kai rup se prayog kiye jate hai
 In addition, if a conductor has a change in magnetic field or the confluence of two types of conductors is heated or there is some chemical action, then an electric force is generated
 anek yantra in siddhanton par nirbhar he
 If there is a difference between any two moving objects, there is attraction between them
 vibhavantar kii maap is aakarshan kii naap ke dwaara bhi ho sakati he
 If an existing particle or electron is projected into a vacuum, the path can be diverted by the influence of an electric or magnetic field
 vidyut upkarnon ke ek vishesh varg main pratirodh maapne kii yuktiyaan hai
 If the resistance of the ends of a conductor is divided by its resistance, which is measured in ohms, the value of current flowing from the conductor becomes known in the ampere
 ise om kaa niyam kehete hai
 The value of the electric power that is being expended at any given time in any circuit is measured in watts and it is equal to the time difference and product of the current
 vidyut shakti watmapi dwaara maapi jaati he
 Energy is usually measured in kilowatt-hours or board of trade units
 shakti ko kilowaton main or samay ko ghanton main maapne par shakti maan unke gunfal ke baraabar hota he
 It is measured energetically
 yadi vidyut sambharan kaa vibhavantar niyat ho, to dhara or samay ke gunanfal ko maapna hi paryaapt hoga or jise vidyut matramaapi darshit kar sakegaa
 If current in a circuit varies and is of particularly high frequency, inductance and electronegativity are two other properties that need to be known
 prerakatv kaa maan chaalak ko ghere hue chumbakeey abhivah ke baraabar hota he
 According to the electromagnetic law, whenever this current decreases, or increases, an electric force is produced in the conductor, which wants to stop this change
 prerakatv kii ikai henry he jo bhautikee ke visheshgy jojef henry ke naam par he
 If the value of current in a conductor increases by one ampere per second and it produces a voltage difference of one volt, then the conductor of this conductor is one henry
 vidyutdharita kaa prabhaav thik iske vipareet he, kyonki isamen prayavarti dhara suvidha se pravaahit nahin ho paati he or disht dhara pravaahit nahin ho sakati
 Efficiency can be equated with a flexible spring, which stops slightly due to constant force, but oscillates under the influence of variable force
 vidyuddhara ke pradhanat: teen prabhaav hote hai- chumbakeey prabhaav, ooshmiya prabhaav, tathaa rasinic prabhaav
 Any of these three effects can be used to determine the presence and value of an electrone, but due to the accuracy and simplicity, often the magnetic effect is used everywhere
 dharamapi do prakaar ke hote hai : See: photometer sparshajya dharamapi sabase saral or upyogi chalchumbak dharamapi he
 There is a circular coil of insulating copper wire on the vertical structure of an non-magnetic material
 kundali main praaia: 552 chakkar hote hai, jisamen 2, 50 or 500 chakkaron ke baad sanyojak pench lage rahete hai
 With their help, you can work with fewer or more rounds as needed
 vrittakar kundali ko urdhwadhar aksh ke chaaron ore ghumaya ja saktaa he
 a magnetic needle rests on the vertical rivet at the center of the coil and a long indicator of aluminum perpendicular to the needle, which rotates along the needle on a horizontal circular scale and deflects the magnetic needle
 yah scale chaar chaturthaanshon main vibhajit rahata he or prayek chaturthaansh main 0 degree se 90 degree tak ke chihn hote hai
 When the magnetic needle is in the magnetic meridian, the indicator remains at zero degree
 chumbakeey kshetra main rakhi hui kisi kundali main jab vidyutdhara pravaahit hoti he, to kundali par ek balyugma kaary karne lagata he, jisus vah ghoomane lagati he
 The dharmapi that have been made by using this principle, they are called chalakunda dharamapi
 isamen ek ytaakar kundali hoti he, jisamen patale or vidyutrodhit taanbe ke taar ke bahut chakkar hote hai
 This coil is hung with a screw by a very thin leaf of phosphor brange, one end of the coil is attached to this leaf and the leaf is connected to a connective screw of the dielectric
 is pattee main ek vrittakar samtal yaa natodar darpan bhi laga rahata he, jo pattee ke saath saath ghumta he
 The second end of the coil is connected to a spiral spring of metal, which is connected to the second connective screw
 yah kundali ek shaktishaalee sthaayee naal chumbak ke dhruvon ke bich main lataki rahati he
 The poles of the magnet are curved in concave cylindrical shape
 ek narm lohe kaa chota sa belan donon dhruvakhandon ke bich main kundali ke bheetar ek pech dwaara dharamapi kii peeth main ksaa rahata he
 All these items are kept locked in an non-magnetic box
 baks ke saamne ke bhaag main kaanch laga rahata he, jisase darpan kaa vikshep lamp tathaa paimaana vidhi se napa ja sake
 When electric current flows in the coil, a force act on the two arms of the coil and rotate the coil from its position, causing a spasm in the phosphor brange leaf and the downward spiral spring and a twitch force pair
 But starts working in the opposite direction
 jisase kundali sheeghra hi santulan main aa jaati he
 See - ammeter is prakaar ke dharamapi vidyutdhara ke ooshmiya prabhaav par nirbhar hote hai
 When current flows through a conductor, then that conductor becomes hot
 utpann ooshmaa kaa maan 2 x ke samaanupati hota he
 If the current is in the ampere and the resistance is in ohms, then ooshmaa kaa maan dharaman ke varg ke samaanupati hota he, arthath dhara kii disha par nirbhar nahin hai
 Therefore, such a power meter can be used to measure both direct or reverse current
 dekhen, dynamometer This device is especially used to measure very weak and transient alternating currents of high frequency
 isamen saadhaarant: chaandi chadha hua sphatik kaa taar, ek shaktishaalee vidyucchumbak ke bich tana rahata he
 The two holes remain round holes in the segments from which a parallel light beam emanates from one side to the other
 ek dhruv khand kii ore prakaash strot or lens hota he or duusare dhruv khand kii ore yaa to doordarshee hota he yaa film camera
 By the light of light, there is a shadow of a wire strung on the film of the telescope of the visionary or the camera
 jab is taar se koi bhi ksheen or kshanik dhara pravaahit hoti he, tab fleming ke niyam ke anusaar taar par ek bal kaary karata he, jisaki disha dhara tathaa chumbakeey kshetra donon hi ke lambavat hoti he
 Due to this force, the wire is removed from its place and the shadow is removed
 jab kshanik yaa prayavarti dhara kaa abhilekh lenaa hota he, to camera kaa film ek meter dwaara chalaa diya jaataa he or dhara taar main pravaahit kii jaati he
 The record of the stream is created on the film of the photo
 jab ksheen disht dhara naapni hoti he, tab camera kii jagah par sookshmmapi netrika laga date hai
 When a direct current flows through a wire, the shadow of the wire diverges to one side
 sookshmmapi netrika se chaaya ke visthaapan ko naap lete hai jisase dhara kaa maan nikal aata he
 It is very sensitive and useful torchometer
 yah adhiktar prayavarti vibhav, yaa dhara kaa tarang rup, gyaan karne ke prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 In fact, it is a dead pulsed dielectric, which has a very high natural oscillation frequency and has very low inertia of the moving parts
 disht dhara naapnevaala ameter adhiktar koi chalkundal dharamapi hota he, jiske samaantar ek parshvavahi taar judaa rahata he
 The lateral current is a low resistor, so the resistance of this device is very low and when it is added in series in a circuit, the current does not change much
 paripath kii adhikansh dhara parshvavahi main hokar bahati he or kuch thodaa bhaag dharamapi kii kundali main se
 The coil is fastened to the aluminum structure and the structure is mounted on the rivet in such a way that the coil can move smoothly between the powerful magnet's pole
 disht vibhav naapnevaala voltmapi saadhaarant: ek chalkundal dharamapi hota he, jisase ek ucch pratirohak shreneebaddh rahata he
 a voltmeter is connected parallel to the two points of a circuit, so its resistance must be the highest, otherwise it will have more current flowing and the voltage between the points will change
 jab lagbhag 3,000 dolan prati second se adhik aavritiwali prayavarti dhara yaa vibhav ko naapane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, to anya dharamapi or unase bane hue dolanlekhi kaa prayog nahin ho saktaa
 In this case it becomes necessary for us to use electronic devices
 is varg ke yantron main sabase adhik upyogi or saral cathod kiran dolanlekhi he
 It shows the magnitude of the electrical signal corresponding to time on the screen in the form of a graph
 aajkal cathod kiran dolankaaree ke sthaan par ankiy dolankaaree prayukt hone lage hai jinke parde, aadhunik alsidi, elidi, tach screen aadi takneekee par aadhaarit hote hai
 If the current flows through an electric fluid, ionization occurs in that fluid
 iske falswaroop dhan aayan cathod par or rin aayan anode par avsaadit ho jate hai
