 afjal khan ne apane doot krishnaji bhaskar ko sandhi-vaarta ke liye bheja
 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control
 saath hi shivaji ko bijapur ke darbar main ek sammanit pad praapt hoga
 Though Shivaji's minister and advisor was in favor of As Sandhi, Shivaji did not like these talks
 unhone krishnaji bhaskar ko uchit sammaan dekar apane darbar main rakh liya or apane doot gopinath ko vastusthiti kaa jayja lene afjal khan ke paas bheja
 From Gopinath and Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji felt that Afzal Khan wanted to imprison Shivaji by plotting a treaty
 atah unhone yuddh ke badale afjal khan ko ek bahumoolya uphaar bheja or is tarah afjal khan ko sandhi vaarta ke liye raji kiya
 Both of them had ambushed their soldiers at the place of peace, when the two met at the place of meeting, Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji with his Katiyar, in defense, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan with his clothes
 afjal khan kii mrityu ke baad shivaji ne panhala ke durg par adhikaar kar liya
 After this, along with taking control of the fortifications of Pawangarh and Vasantgarh, he also failed the attack of Rustom Khan
 isse rajapur tathaa daawul par bhi unka kabja ho gaya
 Now an atmosphere of terror had arisen in Bijapur and the feudals there, forgetting mutual differences, decided to attack Shivaji
 2 oktober 1665 ko bijapuri sena ne panhala durg par adhikaar kar liya
 Shivaji was in trouble, but taking advantage of the darkness of the night, he managed to escape
 bijapur ke sultan ne swayan kaman samhaalkar panhala, pavangadh par apana adhikaar waapas le liya, rajapur ko lut liya or shringargarh ke pradhan ko maar daalaa
 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji
 is sandhi main shivaji ke pita shahji ne madhyasthata kaa kaam kiya
 According to this treaty in 1662, Shivaji was recognized as an independent ruler by the Sultan of Bijapur
 isi sandhi ke anusaar uttar main kalyaan se lekar dakshin main ponda tak kaa or purv main indapur se lekar pashchim main daawul tak kaa bhubhag shivaji ke niyantran main aa gaya
 Shivaji's army had by this time 30,000 infantry and 1000 cavalry
 uttar bharat main badshaah banane kii hode khatm hone ke baad aurangzeb kaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 He was aware of Shivaji's growing sovereignty and appointed his maternal uncle Shaista Khan as the Subedar of the South for the purpose of keeping control over Shivaji
 shyska khan apane 1,50,000 phoj lekar soupan or chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar puna pahunch gaya
 He looted in Maval for 3 years
 ek raat shivaji ne apane 350 mavalo ke saath unpar hamalaa kar diya
 Shaista managed to escape through the window but had to wash her hands with her four fingers in this sequence
 shysta khan ke putr, tathaa chalis rakshakon or anginat sainikon kaa katl kar diya gaya
 After this incident Aurangzeb made Shaista the Subedar of Bengal instead of Deccan and Shahzada Muazzam was sent to replace Shaista
 is jeet se shivaji kii pratishtha main vruddhi hui
 Six years later, Shaista Khan destroyed King Shivaji's entire Mulukh with his 15 xxrep 4 0 army
 is liye us kaa harjaana vasuul karne ke liye shivaji ne mughal kshetron main lutpaat machaana armbh kiya
 Surat was then a stronghold of Western merchants and a gateway for Hindustani Muslims to perform Haj
 yah ek samrudh nagar tha or iskaa bandargah bahut mahatvapurn tha
 Shivaji looted the wealthy merchants of Surat for six days in 1664 with an army of four thousand
 aam aadmi ko unhonen nahin lutaa or phir laut gaye
 The Dutch and the British have mentioned this incident in their articles
 us samay tak europea vyapaariyon ne bharat tathaa anya asian deshon main bas gayi the
 Until Nadir Shah invaded India, no European power thought of attacking the Indian Mughal Empire
 surat main shivaji kii lut se khinn hokar aurangzeb ne inayat khan ke sthaan par gayasuddin khan ko surat kaa faujadaar niyukt kiya
 And Shahzada Muazzam and Deputy General Raja Jaswant Singh were replaced by Diler Khan and Raja Jaisingh
 raja jaisingh ne bijapur ke sultan, europea shaktiyaan tathaa chote samanton kaa sahyog lekar shivaji par akraman kar diya
 In this war, Shivaji started to suffer loss and seeing the possibility of defeat, Shivaji sent a proposal for a treaty
 june 1665 main hui is sandhi ke mutabik shivaji 23 durg mughalon ko de denge or is tarah unke paas keval 12 durg batch jaayenge
 The income from these 23 fortifications was 4 lakh Huns annually
 balaghat or konkan ke kshetra shivaji ko milenge par unhen iske badale main 13 kishton main 40 lakh hun adaa karne honge
 Apart from this, they will also give revenue of 5 lakh Huns every year
 shivaji swayan aurangzeb ke darbar main hone se mukt rahenge par unke putr shambhaji ko mughal darbar main khidamat kerani hogi
 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur
 shivaji ko agra bulaayaa gaya jahaan unhen laga ki unhen uchit sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal
 aurangzeb isse kshubdh hua or usne shivaji ko nazarkaid kar diya or unpar 5000 sainikon ke pehre laga diye
 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later
 lekin apane ajod saahas ore yukti ke saath shivaji or sambhaaji donon isse bhaagane main safal rahe
 Shivaji Maharaj went to Banaras after leaving Sambhaji in Mathura with a believing Brahmin, went to Puri and went safely to Rajgarh
 isse maraathon ko navajivan sa mil gaya
 Aurangzeb suspected Jaisingh and got him murdered by poisoning him
 jaswant singh ke dwaara pahal karne ke baad san 1668 main shivaji ne mughalon ke saath duusari baar sandhi kii
 Aurangzeb recognized Shivaji as the king
 shivaji ke putr shambhaji ko 5000 kii manasabadari mili or shivaji ko puna, chaakan or soopa kaa jila lautaa diya gaya
 However, the Mughal suzerainty over Sinhagad and Purandar remained
 san 1670 main surat nagar ko duusari baar shivaji ne lutaa
 Shivaji got the property worth 132 lakhs from the city and while returning he defeated the Mughal army again near Surat
 san 1674 tak shivaji ne un saare pradeshon par adhikaar kar liya tha jo purandar kii sandhi ke antargat unhen mughalon ko dene pade the
 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently

 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji

 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 iske baad mughalo ne foot daalane kii koshis kii or shivaji ke rajbhishek ke baad bhi puna ke brahmanon ko dhamkee di kaha ki shivaji ko raja maanane se manaa karo
 taaki praja bhi ise na maane !! lekin unki nahin chali
 shivaji ne ashtapradhan mandal kii sthapana kii
 vibhinn rajyon ke duuton, pratinidhiyon ke alaava videshi vyapaariyon ko bhi is samaaroh main aamantrit kiya gaya
 But 12 days after his coronation, his mother had died, for this reason, on 4 October 1674, Shivaji assumed the title of Chhatrapati for the second time
 do baar hue is samaaroh main lagbhag 50 lakh rupee kharch hue
 The establishment of Hindu Swaraj was announced in this ceremony
 vijaynagar ke patan ke baad dakshin main yah pehla hindu samrajya tha
 Like an independent ruler, he introduced a coin in his name
 iske baad bijapur ke sultan ne konkan vijay ke liye apane do senadhishon ko shivaji ke viruddh bheja par ve asafal rahe
 In 1677–78, Shivaji's attention shifted to Karnataka
 bombay ke dakshin main konkan, tungabhadra nadi ke pashchim main belgaum tathaa dharwar kaa kshetra, mysore, vailari, trichur tathaa zinji par adhikaar karne ke baad 4 april, 1680 ko shivaji kaa dehant ho gaya
 Shivaji died on 3 April 1680 after three weeks of illness
 us samay shivaji ke uttaradhikaar sambhaji ko mili
 Shivaji had the eldest son Sambhaji and a second son named Rajaram from his consort
 us samay rajaraam kii umr maatr 10 varsh thi atah maraathon ne shambhaji ko raja maan liya
 Seeing the demise of Aurangzeb King Shivaji at that time, with the desire to rule his whole India, he went out to conquer South India with his 500,000 army
 aurangzeb ne dakshin main atehi adilshaahi 2 dino main ore qutubashhi 1 hi dino main khatam kar di
 But the Marathas, under the leadership of King Sambhaji, maintained their independence while fighting for 9 years
 aurangzeb ke putr shahjada akbar ne aurangzeb ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya
 Seeing his king being mistreated by Aurangzeb and badly hit, the Pura Maratha Swarajya became angry
 unhone apni puri takat se teesraa rajaraam ke netritv main mughalon se sangharsh jari rakhaa
 Rajaram died in 1700 AD
 uske baad rajaraam kii patni tarabai 4 varshiya putr shivaji dwitiya kii sangrakshika banakar raaj karti rahi
 Ultimately 25 years of tired Maratha war fighting of the kingdom was buried in the self-rule of Shivaji, the same chhatrapati of Aurangzeb
 shivaji ko ek kushal or prabud samraat ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Although he did not get much traditional education in his childhood, he was familiar with Indian history and politics
 unhone shukracharya tathaa kautilya ko adarsh maanakar kootneeti kaa sahaara lenaa kai baar uchit samajha tha
 Like his contemporary Mughals, he was also an autocratic ruler, that is, the entire reins of governance were in the hands of the king
 par unke prashaskeey kaaryon main madad ke liye aath mantriyon kii ek parishad thi jinhen ashtapradhan kaha jaataa tha
 In this, the head of the ministers was called Peshwa, who was the most prominent figure after the king
 amaatya vitt or rajasav ke kaaryon ko dekhtaa tha to mantri raja kii vyaktigat dainandini kaa khyal rakhaata tha
 The secretaries worked in the office, which included the royal seal and drafting treaty letters
 sumant videsh mantri tha
 The head of the army was called the commander
 daan or dharmik maamalon ke pramukh ko panditrao kehete the
 The judge was the head of judicial affairs
 maratha samrajya teen yaa chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt tha
 Each province had a subedar called the Prantapati
 harek soobedaar ke paas bhi ek ashtapradhan samiti hoti thi
 Some provinces were only taxpayers and independent in terms of administration
 nyaayavyavastha pracheen paddati par aadhaarit thi
 Shukracharya, Kautilya and Hindu theology were judged as the basis
 gaanv ke patel faujadaari mukademon kii jaanch karte the
 The means of income of the state were landless, but revenue was also charged from Chauth and Sardeshmukhi
 'chouth' padosi rajyon kii suraksha kii guarantee ke liye vasule jane vaala kar tha
 Shivaji used to call himself the Sardeshmukh of the Marathas and in this capacity, Sardeshmukhi tax was collected
 rajbhishek ke baad unhone apane ek mantri ko shaskeey upyog main aane vaale farsi shabdon ke liye upyukt sanskrit shabd nirmit karne kaa kaary saunpa
 Ramchandra Amatya, with the help of a scholar named Dhundhiraja, composed a book called 'rajyavarthakosh'
 is kosh main 1380 farsi ke prashasnic shabdon ke tulya sanskrit shabd the
 Ramchandra has written in it- shivaji ek samarpit hindu the tathaa vah dharmik sahishnu bhi the
 Muslims had religious freedom in their empire
 kai masjidon ke nirmaan ke liye shivaji ne anudaan diya
 Like Hindu Pandits, Muslim saints and fakirs were also respected
 unki sena main musalmaan sainik bhi the
 Shivaji used to promote Hindu culture
 parmparik hindu mulyon tathaa shiksha par bal diya jaataa tha
 He also started his campaigns often on the occasion of Dussehra
 shivaji maharaj ko apane pita se swaraj kii shiksha hi mili jab bijapur ke sultan ne shahji raaje ko bandi bana liya to ek adarsh putr kii tarah unhone bijapur ke shah se sandhi kar shahji raaje ko chhudvaa liya
 This brings a generous element to his character
 usek baad unhone pita kii hatya nahin karwaai jaisaa ki anya samraat kiya karte the
 He got his coronation only after the death of Shahaji Raje, although by that time he had become independent of his father and became the ruler of a large empire
 unke netritv ko sab log sweekaar karte the yahi kaaran he ki unke shasankaal main koi aantarik vidroh jaisi pramukh ghatana nahin hui thi
 He was also a good diplomat with a good commander
 kai jagahon par unhone sidhe yuddh ladane kii bajaay yuddh se bhaag liya tha
 But this was his diplomacy, which always supported him in defeating the biggest enemy
 shivaji maharaj kii "ganimi kawa" naamak kootneeti, jisamen shatru par achaanak akraman karke use haraaya jaataa he, vilobhaniyata se or aadarsahit yaad kiya jaataa he
 These lines are famous in Shivaji Maharaj's pride- bharat kii janaganana anusaar yah gaanv, tehsil sanbhal, jila muradabad, uttar pradesh main sthit he
 Related Census Code: State Code: 09 District Code: 135 Tehsil Code: 00721 uttar pradesh ke jile Flag bastar rajya bharat kii swatantrata ke purv ek riyasat tha

 The main reason for this is that more convenient features are available than other angiometer
 pehali visheshta yah he ki anya konemapi yantron kii bhanti ise prekshan ke samay ekadam sthir rakhana yaa kisi nishchit avasthaa main rakhana anivaary nahin he
 The second feature is that the position of the observer and the point on it are in horizontal, vertical or oblique plane, this device can measure the amount of actual angle made in that plane
 in visheshtaon ke kaaran sextent navik kii uski yatra kii disha kaa gyaan karaane ke liye aaj bhi bada upyog yantra he
 Two types of sextants are used
 ek, baks sextent or doosraa khagoleey yaa navik sextent
 There is no theoretical difference in the texture of the two
 inaki banaavat kaa siddhant yah he ki yadi kisi samtal main prakaash kii koi kiran aamane-saamne munh kiye khadey samtal darpanon se ek ke baad duusare par paravartit hone ke baad dekhi jaae to dekhi gai kiran or mul kiran ke bich bana kone paravartak darpanon ke bich parsparik kone se duuna hoga
 An angle of 120 ° to the sextant can be measured at once
 isse bada kone hone par do yaa adhik se adhik teen bhaag karke naapnaa hoga
 The box sextant is a small, about 8 cm diameter by four cm height
 upar kaa dhakkan khol dene par upar kuch pench or ek burneer thami hui bhujaa dikhaai degi jo anshon par uske chote bhaagon main vibhajit chaap par chal sakati he
 Like a squad, a screw is attached to the arm
 dibiya ke bheetar dhansi pench kii pindi se ek samtal darpan laga rahata he
 This is called a directive mirror
 pench ghumaane se darpan or saath hi ankit chaap par bhujaa main laga burneer chalata he
 This allows the angular momentum of the mirror to be known
 is nirdash darpan ke saamne hi ek doosraa darpan rahata he jiskaa neeche kaa aadha bhaag paardarshee or upar kaa paravartak hota he
 One of the two points between which the angle has to be measured is seen from the transparent part of the horizon mirror with a telescope or hole made in the box and the reflection of the second point appears in the horizon mirror after one reflection from the reference mirror
 is samay pench se nirdesh darpan aise ghumaate hai ki kshitij darpan ke paardarshee bhaag se dekhe bindu kii kiran pratibimb kii kiran par sannipati ho jaae
 At this time, the angle between the two mirrors will be half of the angle formed by the two points at the position of the observer
 darpanon ke bich kaa kone burneer suchak ke saamne ankit chaap par padhaa ja saktaa he jisase binduon ke bich kaa kone gyaat ho sake
 a magnifying lens is placed on the Bernier indicator itself to take correct readings
 magar chaap par anshankan is prakaar kiya jaataa he ki binduon dwaara nirmit kone sidhaa padhaa ja sake
 To provide this facility, double the amount of speed of the mirror is written
 jaise 10° ke saamne 20°, 20° ke saamne 40°, isi prakaar antim anshankan 60° ke saamne 120° likhte hai
 The amount read from this will be the amount of the angle
 kone ek minute tak sahi pard sakate hai
 It is a 60 ° segment of metal whose arc is inscribed
 vakr ke centre se ek bhujaa chaap par faili hoti he
 Bernier and a tactile screw are attached to the tip of this arm
 isi bhujaa par upar nirdesh darpan laga rahata he
 The arm can rotate at the center, along with the direction mirror and Bernier on the arch
 chaap ko thame ek ardhavyas par nirdesh darpan ke saamne aadha paardarshee or aadha paravartak kshitij kaanch dridhtaa se laga hota he jisase hokar dekhne ke liye saamne doorabeen hoti he
 It is clear that its structure is similar to the box sextant and also the mode of observation
 surya ke prekshan ke liye rangeen kaanch rahata he
 The fraction and its small division are made up to 20 ¢ or 10 ¢ according to the size of the device at an arc of 60 °
 burneer se 202 yaa 102 tak padhane kii suvidha rahati he
 In order to obtain the correct reading from the sextant, the following geometric relationships must be made and, if not, these relationships are established by adjusting: suchakank or kshitij kaanch chaap ke samtal par lamb hon, When the Bernier index is zero, the director and the horizon mirror are parallel, and drushtirekha chaap ke samtal ke samaantar ho
 In mathematics, ratio is the relation between two numbers of the same type
 praayah ise "a sambandh b" yaa a:b kehete hai
 For example, if the ratio of the height of two trees is 3: 5, it means that if the height of the first tree is 3 meters, the height of the second will be 5 meters
 athwa pehle kii unchaai 9 meter ho to duusare kii 15 meter hogi

 To further aid organizations in their quest to measure the overall performance of their performance of performance glasses, Blue is a second-generation performance measurement and management framework that has been developed by Adams
 is model ke rachanakaaron sanghathanon lagbhag kisi bhi udyog ke bheetar kaam karne ke liye, prabandhan kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki sanghathan ke saath jude hitdharakon kii apekshaaon ko puraa karne ke liye he ki suzav
 Performance glasses are designed to help organizations with complex relationships that often possess with their various stakeholders in the context of their operating environment

 This model can thus be adopted as a way of ultimately measuring an organization's performance, rather than simply operating within an industry that other similar as a scorecard balanced by offering a unique perspective on a measurement system Tries to differentiate itself from the model

 The recent financial crisis has provided a still further impetus to search for a forward-looking provision approach to pro-cyclical considerations
 nipsdhikariyon yaa bank prabandhan dwaara nirdhaarit rup main saamaanya praavdhaanon saamaanya rup se purv purv bana rahe hai
 Such a policy is pro-cyclical for making special provisions, whereas for general provisions that the purpose for its use is not to lay down rules
 bhartiya bainkon ke liye vartmaan main rin haani praavdhaanon ke nimnlikhit prakaar karte hai:maanak aastiyon ke liye saamaanya praavdhaanon •,enpie ke liye vishesh praavdhaan •,• praavdhaanon floating,• ek punargathan parisampatti kaa uchit mulya main kami ke khilaaf praavdhaan
 The following drawbacks of the current provisioning policy are: • The rate of standard asset provisions has not been determined on the basis of any scientific analysis or credit loss history of Indian banks
 • bainkon kisi bhi purv nirdhaarit niyamon ke bina unki marzi se chal praavdhaan nahin he or sabhi bainkon ke asthaayee praavdhaan karnaa
 This makes inter-bank comparisons difficult
 • yah praavdhaneekaran dhaanche pratichakree yaa chakra ke tatwon ke paas nahin he
 The Reserve Bank of India's policy of countercyclical variation of standard asset provisioning rates has been followed, the methodology has been largely based on currently available data and justice, rather than on an analysis of the credit cycle and loss history

 In addition, the depositor has the option to withdraw money at any point of introduction or time

 However, this is extremely important because the main reason for the closure of banks has been the inability to pay depositors on demand suddenly

 Adiguru Shankaracharya began to feel that in that era of social upheaval, it is not enough to meet these challenges only with spiritual power
 unhone jor diya ki yuva sadhu vyaayaam karke apane sharir ko sudrudh banaayen or hathiyaar chalaane main bhi kushalta hasil karen
 Therefore, such monasteries were built where such exercises or weapon operations were practiced, such monasteries came to be called akhada
 aam bolchaal kii bhashaa main bhi akhaade un jagahon ko kaha jaataa he jahaan pahalwaan kasarat ke daanvpench sikhte hai

 After the independence of India, these Akharas renounced their military character
 in akhaadon ke pramukh ne jor diya ki unke anuyaayi bhartiya samskruti or darshan ke sanatani mulyon kaa adhyayan or anupaalan karte hue sanyamit jivan vyateet karen

 The word 'kashika' can have two meanings
 pratham arth ke anusaar, 'kashika' 'kaash' dhaatu se nishpann he isaliye kashika kaa arth 'prakashit karne vaali' yaa 'prakashika' hua 
 According to Kashyadha lecturer Harddutt, the second interpretation is that Kashika was composed in Kashi, hence it was called Kashika
 yah jayaditya or vaaman naam ke do vidwaanon kii sammilit kriti he
 Both the Chinese traveler Etshing and the author of the linguistic-semantics, Srishyadharacharya, have not only written Kashika as Jayaditya, but many ancient scholars have mentioned both Jayaditya and Vamana while quoting Kashika
 unke apane-apane likhe adhyyon par bhi prakaash daalaa gaya he
 The first, second, fifth and best chapters of Jayaditya have been written and the remaining parts of Vamana have been written in the word 'ratnarnavya' of Adult Manorama
 parantu kashika kii lekhanstyli ko dhyanpurvak dekhne se prathit hota he ki aarambh ke paanch adhyay jayaditya virachit hai or ant ke teen vaaman ke likhe hai
 On the basis of some concrete evidence, it has been assumed that Jayaditya and Vamana composed their various complete vrittis on the entire Ashtadhyayi
 par yah abhi rahasy hi he ki kab or kaise kuch ansh jayaditya ke or kuch vaaman ke lekar yah kashika bani
 Yet it is certified that this integration of vrittis had already taken place before Vikram Samvat 700

 Einstein's intellectual achievements and singularities have made the term "einstein" synonymous with "intelligent"
 albert oinstin kaa janm germany main wootemberg ke ek yahudee parivaar main hua
 His father was an engineer and salesman
 unki maan paulin oinstin thi
 Although Einstein had difficulty speaking initially, he topped the studies
 unki maatrubhaasha german thi or baad main unhone italvi or angreji bhi sikhi
 In 1880 his family moved to the city of Munich, where his father and uncle jointly opened a company called "electrotechnic Frébich J
 Einstein & See", which manufactured electrical appliances
 or isane munich ke Oktoberfest meley main pehali baar roshni kaa prabandh bhi kiya tha
 His family did not believe in Jewish religious traditions, and for this reason Einstein could go to Catholic school
 apni maan ke kehane par unhone sarangi bajaanaa siikhaa
 He did not like this and later abandoned it, but later he enjoyed Mozart's Sarangi music
 1894 main, unke pita kii company ko munich shahar main vidyut prakaash vyavastha ke liye aapurti karne kaa anubandh nahin mil sakaa
 Due to the loss, he had to sell his company
 vyapaar kii talash main, oinstin parivaar italy chale gaye, jahaan ve sabase pehle milan or phir kuch maheene baad pavia shahar main bas gayi
 Even after the family left for Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to complete his studies
 disambar 1894 ke ant main, unhone pavia main apane parivaar se milane italy kii yatra kii
 During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay titled "examining the state of the ether in a magnetic field"
 apane puure jeevankaal main, oinstin ne saikadon kitaaben or lekh prakashit kiye
 He published more than 300 scientific and 150 non-scientific research papers
 1965 ke apane vyaakhyaan main, oppenheimar ne ullekh kiya ki oinstin ke praarambhik lekhan main kai trutiyon hoti thi jiske kaaran unke prakaashan main lagbhag das varshon kii deree ho chuki thi: " ek aadmi jiskaa trutiyon ko hi sahi karne main ek lanbaa samay lage, kitna mahaan hoga"
 Apart from his own work, he also collaborated with other scientists, including Bose Einstein statistics, Einstein refrigerator and many more
 
 Anus Mirabilis Papers is related to four articles that Einstein published in 1905 in a scientific journal called Onlen der Physik, which included photoelectric effects, Brownian motion, special relativism, and e = mc2
 in chaar lekhon ne aadhunik bhautikee kii neenv ke liye kaaphi yogadan diya he or antariksh, samay tathaa dravya par logo kii soch ko badla he
 These four papers are: san 1900 main onalen der physic ko prastut, oinstin ke pehla shodh-patr "keshika aakarshan" par tha
 It was published in 1901 with the title "extracts from capillary phenomena"
 1902-1903 main prakashit do patron main parmanuviya ghatana kii vyakhya, sankhyikeey ke madhyam se karne kaa prayaas kiya
 This paper formed the foundation for a 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian motion can be used as concrete evidence for the presence of molecules
 1903 or 1904 main unka shodh mukhya rup se, prasar ghatana par parimit parmaanu aakaar kaa asar par sambandhit rahe
 He expressed the principle of relativity
 jo ki harman minkovski ke anusaar antariksh se antariksh-samay ke bich baari-baari se parivartanheenata ke samanyikaran ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Other theories that Einstein coined and later proved to be correct included the principle of equality and the theory of temperate normalization of quantum numbers
 oinstin ke "chalit nikaayon ke bijli kaa gativigyaan par" shodh-patr 30 june 1905 ko purna hua or usee varsh kii 26 sitambar ko prakashit hua
 This establishes harmony between Maxwell's equation of electricity and magnetism and the theory of mechanics, after major changes in mechanics close to the speed of light
 yahi baad main oinstin ke saapekshata ke vishesh siddhant ke rup main janaa gaya
 The conclusion was that, in the time-space structure, the moving matter is seen as slow and narrow, when it is measured in the observer's frame
 is shodh-patr main yah bhi tark diya ki luminipheras ether kaa vichaar zarurat se zyaada tha
 In his paper on mass-energy equivalence, Einstein constructed e = mc2 from special relativity equations
 1905 se oinstin kaa saapekshata main shodh kai varshon tak vivaadaaspad bana rahaa, halaaki ise kai agrani bhautikavidon jaise kii maiks plank dwaara sweekaara bhi gaya
 In a 1905 paper, Einstein explained that light itself is made up of local particles
 oinstin ke prakaash quanta pariklpana ko maiks plank or niles bor sahit lagbhag sabhi bhautikavidon, ne asweekaar kar diya
 This hypothesis was universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Mulliken's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and the Compton scattering measurements
 oinstin ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki aavriti kii prayek lahar, urja ke prayek photonon ke sangrah ke saath judaa hota he 
 He did not say more about this, because he was not sure how particles are related to waves
 lekin unhone suzav diya kii he,ki is pariklpana ko kuch prayogtmak parinaamon dwaara samajhaayaa ja saktaa hai jise hi baad main vishesh rup se prakashavidyut prabhaav kaha gaya
 In 1907, Einstein proposed a model that each atom oscillates independently in a lattice structure
 oinstin model main, prayek parmaanu swatantra rup se dolan karata he oinstin ko pataa tha ki vaastavik dolanon kii aavriti alag hoti hai lekin phir bhi is siddhant kaa prastaavit kiya, kyonki yah ek spasht pradarshan tha ki kaise kwantum yantriki, parmparik yantriki main vishisht garmi kii samasya ko hal kar saktaa hai
 Peter debai refined this model

 Following the discovery of Ernest Rutherford's nucleus, and the proposition that electrons revolve around planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the discrete motion of electrons in atoms of elements by quantum mechanical, initiated by Planck and developed by Einstein And the periodic table of the elements can be explained
 1898 ke wilhem viena ke tark ko iske saath jod kar oinstin ne iske vikaas main yogadan diya
 Vienna showed that, by the hypothesis of a thermodynamic variability of a thermal equilibrium state, all black rotations at different temperatures can be derived from each other by a simple transfer process
 1911 main oinstin ne yah paaya kii vahi samoshna siddhant yah dikhaata hai kii maatra jo kisi bhi yantric gati main pramaathran he ko ek sthiroshm aparivartaneey hona chahie
 Arnold Summerfield identified temperate invertebrates as dynamic variables in traditional mechanics

 Prabhukh administrative languages are Urdu and English
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, antarrashtriya simaaon yaa kshetron ke aar-paar puunji, maal or sevaaon kaa aadan-pradaan he
 
 In most countries, it represents a significant fraction of GDP
 jabaki antarrashtriya vyapaar, itihaas ke adhikansh bhaag main maujuud rahaa he iskaa aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik mahatv haal kii sadiyon main badhane laga he
 Industrialization, advanced transport, globalization, multinational corporations and outsourcing have all had a wide impact on the international trade system
 vaishvikaran kii nirantarata ke liye antarrashtriya vyapaar main badhotaree mahatvapurn he
 Without international trade, countries will be limited to goods and services produced within their own borders
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, siddhant rup main gharelu vyapaar se bhinn nahin he kyonki ek vyapaar main shaamil pakshon kii abhiprerana or vyavhaar moulik rup se badalata nahin he bhale hi vyapaar seemaa paar kaa ho yaa nahin
 The main difference is that international trade is generally more expensive than domestic trade
 iskaa kaaran he ki ek seemaa aam taur par atirikt shulk lagaati he jaise prashulk, seemaa par vilamb ke kaaran aavadhik laagat or bhashaa, kanoonee pranali yaa samskruti jaise deshiy bhinnataaon se judi laagtein
 Another difference between domestic and international trade is that production factors such as capital and labor are generally more dynamic within countries than outside
 is prakaar antarrashtriya vyapaar zyaadaatar maal or sevaaon ke vyapaar tak simit he or puunji, shram yaa utpaadan ke anya karkon ke vyapaar main keval ek chote paimaane par
 iske alaava maal or sevaaon kaa vyapaar, utpaadan karkon main vyapaar ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main kaary kar saktaa he
 Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of the factor of production and thus include the related factor
 An example is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China
 Rather than importing Chinese labor, the US is importing goods from China that are produced using Chinese labor
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, arthshaastra kii ek shakha bhi he, jo antarrashtriya vitt ke saath milakar antarrashtriya arthshaastra kii vistrut shakha kaa nirmaan karti he
 Several different models have been proposed to forecast the methodology of trade and to analyze the impact of trade policies such as tariffs
 ricardian model tulanaatmak laabh par kendrit he or antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main shaayad sabase mahatvapurn avadharana he
 In a Ricardian model, countries specialize in the production of the things they produce well
 anya modelon ke vipareet, ricardian dhaancha purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, maal kii ek vistrut shrunkhlaa kaa utpaadan karne ke bajaay visheshgy honge
 In addition, the Ricardian model does not directly consider factor funds, such as the relative amount of labor and capital within a country
 The major advantage of the Ricardin model is that it visualizes technology variations between countries
 praudyogiki antar, ricardian or ricardo-srapha model main aasaani se shaamil hota he 
 The Ricardian model makes the following assumptions: ricardian model laghu-avadhi main maapan karata he, isliye praudyogiki antarrashtriya str par bhinn hoti he
 This supports the fact that countries follow their comparative advantage and allow for specialization
 ricardian vyapaar model kaa adhyayan graham, jones, mekenzi or anya dwaara kiya gaya
 All principles excluded trade input goods such as intermediate goods, commodities and capital goods
 mekenji, jones or samuelson ne jor diya ki vyapaar se madhyavarti vastuon ko baahar rakhe jane se kaaphi laabh kho jayega
 ek prasiddh tippanee main mekenji ne kaha ki "ek pal kaa vichaar ek vyakti ko samajha degaa ki sooti kapade kaa utpaadan karne ke liye lankashair asambhavy hoga, yadi kapaas ko england main ugaana pade
 More recently, it expanded the theory to include the business intermediate case as well
 is prakaar "keval shram" dharna siddhant se nikaal di gai
 Thus the new Ricardian theory, sometimes named the ricardo-sraffa model, theoretically includes capital goods such as machines and materials that are traded between countries
 vaishvik vyapaar ke samay main, yah dharna heksher-olin model kii apeksha adhik yathartwaadee he, jo yah maanata he ki puunji, desh ke andar sthir he or antarrashtriya str par gatisheel nahin he
 In the early 1900s, two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Olin, created an international trade theory called the factor ratio theory
 is siddhant ko heksher-olin siddhant bhi kaha jaataa he
 The heckscher-olin theory emphasizes that countries should produce and export goods that require resources that are abundant and must import goods that require short-supply resources
 yah siddhant, tulanaatmak laabh or purna laabh ke siddhanton se bhinn he kyonki ye siddhant ek vishesh vastu ke liye utpaadan prakriya kii utpaadakta par kendrit hai
 In contrast, the heckscher-olin theory states that a country should specialize in production and export using factors that are most abundant and therefore cheap
 Do not produce those goods, as stated by earlier theories, which they produce most efficiently
 heksher-olin model ko buniyadi tulanaatmak laabh ke ricardian model ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Despite its greater complexity, it did not prove to be more accurate in its forecasts

 Empirical problems with the HO model, known as the Leontief paradox, were encountered in empirical tests by Vasily Leontief, who found that the US was exporting labor-intensive goods despite the abundance of capital

 In HO theory, labor and capital are constant substances for each country

 In 1953, Vecily Leontief published a study where he tested the validity of the heckscher-olin theory
 The study showed that the US was more abundant in capital than other countries, so the US was exporting capital-intensive goods and importing labor-intensive goods
 Leontief found that US exports were less capital-intensive than imports

 Differentiation of technology between developed and developing countries is a major concern for poor countries
 is model main, udyogon ke bich shram gatishiltaa sambhav he, jabaki alpavadhi main udyogon ke bich puunji sthir he
 Thus, this model can be interpreted as a 'short-term' version of the Heckscher – Olin model

 In the 19th century, especially in the United Kingdom, trust in free trade became paramount
 uske baad se yah dharna pashchimi deshon ke bich prabhavi soch ban gai
 In the years following World War II, controversial multilateral treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization attempted to promote free trade by creating a globally regulated trade framework
 in vyapaar samjhauton ne, anuchit vyapaar ke daavon ke saath jo vikasshil deshon ke liye laabhadaayak nahin hai, aksar virodh or asantosh ko janm diya he
 Free trade is generally the most favored by the most economically strong countries, although they often engage in selective protectionism for industries that are strategically important, such as the US and Europe's imposition of agriculture
 a protective tariff
 The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were staunch advocates of free trade at the time when they were financially influential, today the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan being its biggest supporters
 haalanki, kai anya desh tezi se mukt vyapaar ke himachati banate ja rahe hai kyonki ve aarthik rup se khud adhik shaktishaalee ban rahe hai
 As the tariff level is declining, the desire to discuss non-tariff measures is also increasing, including foreign direct investment, recovery and trade facilitation
 Trade facilitation takes into account customs procedures and transaction costs related to carrying out trade

 During a recession, there is often excessive domestic pressure to increase tariffs to protect domestic industries

 Previous articles have discussed how international businesses need supporting ecosystems and business-friendly policies if they are to succeed in emerging markets

 Often, there is not an option for governments of many countries but they are also known as welcoming international businesses as they need "cash" or dollars
 udhaaharan ke liye, niryaat or aayaat ke bich ke antar ko chaalu khate ke ghate yaa siedi ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Since many emerging markets, the deficit is the ones that need funding with the dollar

 In addition, domestic industry capabilities may not be a particular area nor the expertise to be successful in developing that field
 isliye, epadiai ki kshetra ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 In addition, the opening of the economy is necessary for entry into the World Trade Organization or World Trade Organization, which means that in order to export to other countries, to open in emerging markets and developing economies
 in vajahon se vikasshil deshon main kai sarkarein apane-apane deshon main seoup ke sanchaalan ke liye antarrashtriya kaarobaar main videshi nivesh ko protsaahit karne or anumati dene ke kuch kar rahe hai
 However, a host of factors that do not continue the policies of the same governments include the ideological balance of governments, the compulsions of politics, and the fact that foreign investment may not succeed in kick-starting as a planned economy
 it depends on
 yahaan mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon ke kai sarkarein aksar kyonki uparokt kaarnon kaa khuli bahon se antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat he
 However, through the intervening process, some of them develop cold feet due to policy paralysis, and the factors listed above
 yah samajha ja saktaa he ki antarrashtriya kaarobaar ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon main pravesh karne kii ijaajat di dwidaleey arth he ki vahaan sabhi hitdharakon se is mudde par vyapak sahmati hona chahie hona chahie kii jarurat he
 Only then will international business succeed in emerging market economies

 Finally, examples from China, Brazil, South Africa, and Vietnam demonstrate the need for a consensus on the opening of economies and following through on this process
 duusari ore, bharat or rus ke udhaaharan ke anya tareeke se in deshon khuli bahon ke saath majaburiyon ke kaaran unki arthvyavasthaaon ko kholaa or phir lekin gati ko banaae rakhane ke rup main asafal aasapaas hai
 This means that integration in the global economy will only take place when the process of reforms is stopped wholeheartedly or without a U-turn

 This abnormality can be seen in any of the primary teeth or in the pitted teeth
 In this abnormality, 2 teeth are formed from a bud that develops, which is connected to only 1 cell! Due to which the cells of both the teeth are joined and if ever one of the two teeth is pathological, then at that time both teeth can be treated instead of one tooth
 There are 2 root canals of joined teeth and 2 pulp chambers
 It takes a similar thing to see both the fusion and fusion, but there is a difference between them that there is 1 germ cell in the gemination but 2 teeth are formed from it
 Whereas in fusion there are 2 cells of germs and 1 tooth is attached to them
