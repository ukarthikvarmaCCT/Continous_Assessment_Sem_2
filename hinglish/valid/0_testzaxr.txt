 At a scientific conference in 1952, Pincus and Rock, who had known each other for many years, discovered they were using similar methods to achieve opposite goals
 In 1952, Rock continued with a slowly increasing oral dose of estrogen and a three-month ovulation induced "pseudo-pregnancy" state in eighty of her infertility patients, and an encouraging 15% pregnancy within four months following progesterone

 On 23 January 1957, Anobhid held a symposium reviewing gynecology and contraceptive research on an anovid through 1956 and concluded that the anobhid estrogen content could be reduced by up to 33% to significantly increase the incidence of breakthrough bleeding without increasing estrogenic gastrointestinal side effects
 The incidence is low

 In Japan, lobbying from the Japan Medical Association prevented the pill from being approved for nearly 40 years
 The two main objections by the association were safety concerns over long-term use of the pill and concerns that the use of the pill would lead to reduced condom use and thus possibly increase sexually transmitted infection rates

 a backlash against oral contraceptives occurred in the early and mid-1970s when reports and speculation appeared that linked the use of the pill to breast cancer
 By then, many women in the feminist movement had welcomed the pill as an "equalizer" that had given them the same sexual freedom as men had traditionally enjoyed

 Hearing on the pill began in the United States Senate in 1970 and there were perspectives heard from various medical professionals
 dow maaikel newton, Obstetricians or Gynecologists ke college ke adhyaksh ne kaha: "the evidence is not yet clear whether these are still actually the cause of cancer or related to it
 The FDA advisory committee commented about this, if there is enough evidence to indicate whether or not these pills are related to the development of cancer
 Were not and i think that is still thin, you have to be cautious about them, but i don't think there is clear evidence, either one way or the other, that they do May include or does not cause cancer

 a closed figure surrounded by four simple lines is called a quadrilateral
 eucalidian samtal jyamiti main, chaturbhuj ek bahubhuj he jisamen chaar kinare or chaar sheersh hote hai
 The word "quadrilateral" derives from two Latin words 'quadri', meaning 'a variant of four', and 'latus', meaning "arm"
 chaturbhuj saral yaa jatil hote hai
 Simple quadrilaterals are convex or concave

 { \ displaystyle \ angle a + \ angle b + \ angle c + \ angle d = 360 ^ { \ circ}
} yah aantarik kone yoga sutara × 180° dwaara praapt hota he
 Any quadrilateral that is not self-intersecting is an ordinary quadrilateral
 uttal chaturbhuj In a convex quadrilateral, all interior angles are less than 180 ° and both lie inside the diagonal quadrilateral
 aniyamit chaturbhuj : koi bhi bhujaayen samanaantar nahin hoti he
 Trapezium: At least one pair of opposite sides is parallel
 samaantar chaturbhuj ek samalamb chaturbhuj hota he
 Isosceles Trapezoid: At least one pair of opposite sides is parallel and the base angles are equal in measure
 vaikalpik paribhaasha ke anusaar, yah samaan lambaai ke vikarnon vaala samalamb chaturbhuj hota he
 Parallel Quadrilateral: a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides
 aisa chaturbhuj, jisamen sammukh bhujaayen baraabar; sammukh kone baraabar; yaa vikarn ek duusare ko samdvibhajit karte hai
 a rhombus is a parallelogram
 samachatubhuj : sabhi chaaron bhujaayen samaan hoti hai or donon vikarn ek duusare ko lamb-samdvibhajit karte hai
 a square is a rhombus
 aayat : sammukh bhujaayen samaan hoti hai, chaaron kone samakon hote hai, vikarn ek duusare ko samdvibhajit karte hai or lambaai main baraabar hote hai
 a square is a rectangle
 varg : sabhi chaaron bhujaayen samaan hoti hai, or chaaron kone samakon hote hai
 The opposite sides are parallel, the diagonals bisect each other and are of equal length
 ek chaturbhuj ek varg hoga yadi vah ek samachatubhuj bhi ho or ek aayat bhi
 Kite-shaped quadrilateral: Two pairs of adjacent arms are of equal length

 a convex quadrilateral will be a cyclic quadrilateral if the sum of its opposite sides is the same
 chakree chaturbhuj : chaturbhuj ke chaaron sheersh ek parivritt par sthit hote hai
 a convex quadrilateral will be cyclic if the sum of its opposite angles is 180 °
 avatal chaturbhuj In a concave quadrilateral, an interior angle is greater than 180 ° and one of the two diagonals is located outside the diagonal
 aisa chaturbhuj, jo swayan ko pratichchhed kare, jatil chaturbhuj kehalaata he
 Diagonal: a quadrilateral has two diagonals, which connect opposite vertices
 dvimadhyikaaye : ek uttal chaturbhuj main do dvimadhyikaaye hoti hai jo vipareet bhujaaon ke madhya binduon ko jodatii hai
 These two intersect at the nucleus of the quadrilateral
 ek uttal chaturbhuj ABCD jisamen bhujaayen a = AB, b = BC, c = CD and d = DA hai, kaa kshetrafal gyaat karne ke liye vibhinn saamaanya sutara hai
 Trigonometric formulas kisi chaturbhuj kaa kshetrafal k { \ displaystyle K}, trikoshmetiya padon main nimna prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he- k = 1 2 pq ⋅ sin ⁡ θ, { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} pq \ cdot \ sin \ theta,} jahaan p { \ displaystyle p} or q { \ displaystyle q} vikarnon kii lambaaiyaan hai or unke bich kone θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } he
 The area of a quadrilateral can also be expressed in terms of its diagonals
 k = m n ⋅ sin ⁡ φ, { \ displaystyle K=mn \ cdot \ sin \ varphi ,} Where m { \ displaystyle m} and n { \ displaystyle n} are the lengths of the quadrilateral of the quadrilateral and the angle between them is φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi}
 bratsnidar kaa sutara, chaturbhuj kii bhujaaon or do vipareet konon ke sandarbh main kshetrafal ko vyakt karata he: k = - 1 2 abcd = - abcd { \ displaystyle { \ begin {aligned} k & = { \ sqrt {- { \ tfrac {1} {2}} abcd \ ;}} \ \ & = { \ sqrt {-abcd \ left}} \ end {aligned}}} jahaan a, b, c, d { \ displaystyle a,b,c,d} chaturbhuj kii bhujaayen hai or s { \ displaystyle s} chaturbhuj kaa arddh parimaap he, or a { \ displaystyle A} or c { \ displaystyle C} do vipareet kone hai
 The formula for another area in the positions of the sides and angles, where the angle c { \ displaystyle C}, the middle of the arms b and c, and the angle a { \ displaystyle A}, is the angle between the arms a and d
 k = 1 2 a d ⋅ sin ⁡ a + 1 2 b c ⋅ sin ⁡ c 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}ad \ cdot \ sin {A}+{ \ tfrac {1}{2}}bc \ cdot \ sin {C}
} For a cyclic quadrilateral, the formula is k = 1 2 sin ⁡ a 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}} \ sin {A}
} For a parallelogram, this formula is k = a b ⋅ sin ⁡ a 
 { \ displaystyle K=ab \ cdot \ sin {A}
} Alternatively, we can write the formula of the area in terms of the angle θ between the sides and diagonals of the quadrilateral as follows: k = | tan ⁡ θ | 4 ⋅ | a 2 + c 2 − b 2 − d 2 | 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ frac {| \ tan \ theta |}{4}} \ cdot \ left|a^{2}+c^{2}-b^{2}-d^{2} \ right|
} For a parallelogram, this formula is k = 1 2 | tan ⁡ θ | ⋅ | a 2 − b 2 | 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}| \ tan \ theta | \ cdot \ left|a^{2}-b^{2} \ right|
} Another formula for the area of a quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d { \ displaystyle a, b, c, d} is- k = 1 4 − 4 x 2 ) − 4 x 2 ) sin ⁡ φ { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{4}}{ \ sqrt {-4x^{2})-4x^{2})}} \ sin { \ varphi }} Where x { \ displaystyle x} is the distance between the midpoints of the diagonals and φ { \ displaystyle \ varphi} is the angle between the diagonals
 bhujaaon a, b, c, d { \ displaystyle a,b,c,d} or bhujaaon a { \ displaystyle a} tathaa b { \ displaystyle b} ke bich kone α { \ displaystyle \ alpha } vaale chaturbhuj ke kshetrafal ke liye antim trikoshmetiya sutara nimna he: k = 1 2 ab ⋅ sin ⁡ α + 1 4 4 c 2 d 2 - 2, { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} ab \ cdot \ sin { \ alpha} + { \ tfrac {1 } {4}} { \ sqrt {4c ^ {2} d ^ {2} - ^ {2}}},} is sutara ko avatal chaturbhuj ke kshetrafal ke liye bhi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, bas pehle + chihn ko - se badalanaa hoga
 Non trigonometric formulas nimnlikhit donon sutara bhujaaon a, b, c, d, ardhparimaap s tathaa vikarnon p va q ke padon main kshetrafal vyakt karte hai- k = - 1 4, { \ displaystyle k = { \ sqrt {- { \ tfrac {1} {4 xxrep 5 } ,} k = 1 4 4 p 2 q 2 − 2 
 { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{4}}{ \ sqrt {4p^{2}q^{2}- \ left^{2}}}
} The formula for area can also be expressed in terms of diagonals m, n and diagonals p, q - k = 1 2 , { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{2}}{ \ sqrt {}},} k = 1 2 p 2 q 2 - 2
 { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} { \ sqrt {p ^ {2} q ^ {2} - ^ {2}}}
} vastav main, kshetrafal ke liye m, n, p tathaa q main se koi teen maan hi paryaapt hai kyonki kisi chaturbhuj main ye chaaron maan nimna prakaar sambandhit hote hai- p 2 + q 2 = 2 
 { \ displaystyle p^{2}+q^{2}=2
} Therefore, by placing the value of any three in this formula, the value of the fourth variable can be easily obtained
 tab, teen kinhin padon main chaturbhuj ke kshetrafal kaa sutara nimna he- k = 1 2 ⋅, { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} { \ sqrt { \ cdot}},} k = 1 4 ⋅ , { \ displaystyle K={ \ tfrac {1}{4}}{ \ sqrt { \ cdot }},} Vector formula kisi chaturbhuj ABCD kaa kshetrafal, sadishon kaa prayog karke praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Let vector AC and BD are diagonals from a to c and b to d respectively
 tab chaturbhuj kaa kshetrafal nimna hoga: k = 1 2 | AC × BD |, { \ displaystyle k = { \ tfrac {1} {2}} | \ mathbf {AC} \ times \ mathbf {BD} |,} jo sadishon AC or BD ke sadish gunan ke pariman kaa aadha he

 1917 kii vishesh paristhitiyon main isko safalataa praapt hui
 The background of Russian socialism was different from the situation in other European socialisms

 There was also a lack of democratic governance and individual freedoms
 roosi buddhijivi or madhyamvarg inke liye icchhuk tha par jaarshahi damanniti ke kaaran inaki prapti kaa sanvaidhanik maarg avaruddhapraay tha
 Influenced by these circumstances, the first socialists there considered the rural commune of Russia as the basis of their ideas and considered the first step to the success of democraticism by destroying the Tsar by revolutionary path

 Influenced by these, many intellectuals headed towards the revolution

 Its influence was mainly in the civilian working class

 Hence there was more political consciousness and organization among these laborers

 Around 1890 Axelrod and Plekhanov established the first working group in Petersburg which later became the basis of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party in 1898
 roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor party ke netaa kattar marxvaadi the, at: unhone punraritivaad ko asweekaar kiya or marxvad ko viksit kar roosi paristhitiyon main lagu kiya
 The level of living of the workers had improved, it was difficult not to believe this truth, but Plekhanov proved that the rate of capitalist exploitation is increasing due to the use of new machines and the expected increase in wages

 In this conference, the nationalization of the means of production, the abolition of zamindari, the right to self-build the colonies, the revolutionary path to attain the goal and the dictatorship of the proletariat after the revolution - this policy was accepted, but there were differences in the leaders regarding the organization of the party Gone
 prashn tha ki dal kii sadsyta keval kaaryakartaaon tak simit ho athwa aadarshon ko sweekaar karanevaala prayek vyakti uskaa adhikari ho or kya kendriya samiti ko dal kii shakhaon ke bhang karne or unke sthaan main nai shakhaon kii niyukti karne kaa adhikaar ho? lenin ek faujee anushaasanwale suvyavasthit dal ke paksh main tha or conference main uskaa bahumat tha, at: is dhara kaa naam bolshevik padaa or duusari dhara menshevik kahalaai
 Later on, more differences emerged between these parties
 menshavik dal pehle jaarshahi kaa ant kaa poonjeewaadi loktantratmak kranti karnaa chahta tha or is kranti main vah poonjeewaadi dalon ke vam paksh se sahyog karnaa chahta tha, parantu 1905 kii kranti ke baad lenin uske saathi is nishkarsh par pahunche ki samaajawaadee kranti ke bhay ke kaaran poonjeevaad pratikriyaavaadi ho gaya he, at: vah poonjeewaadi loktantratmak kranti kaa netritv karne main bhi asamarth he
 Therefore, only the proletariat can lead this revolution and it is possible to combine this revolution with the proletarian revolution and establish socialism immediately after the monarchy
 kranti main kisaanon kaa sahyog praapt karne ke liye lenin samantvaadi jameen ko kisaanon main baantne ke paksh main tha, menshavik uskaa turant samajikaran karnaa chaahate the

 Many things come in the extrovert design of Nadiaghati scheme
 unamem mukhya ye hai : baadhon kii rokthaam, nadiyon dwaara jalmaarg kii suvidha paryaapt karana, bade baandhon kaa nirmaan tathaa unke dwaara panbizli kaa utpaadan, baandhon dwaara sinchit jal se bhusinchan ke saadhan uplabdh karnaa, pani ke niyantran se bhoomi ke kataav ko rokna tathaa bhoomi sangrakshan ke nimitt vividh prakaar ke sthaliy kaary karnaa, vansanksharan tathaa van or krishi kii bhoomi kaa yathanukool vibhaajan tathaa niyantran, matsay utpaadan tathaa uske vitaran kaa prabandh, pashu or pakshiyon kii dekharekh tathaa unki vruddhi kaa aayojan, ghati ke kshetra main malaria aadi anya bimariyon aadi anya bimariyon kii rokthaam, krishi utpaadan kii khapat tathaa vitaran kaa aayojan, yatayaat kaa prabandh, panbizli dwaara sanchalit udyogon kaa aayojan, udyogon dwaara badhati samasyaon kaa samayik samaadhaan; nadiyon kii swatchta par niyantran tathaa maanav jivan se sambandhit bahut si anya baton kaa aayojan, prabandh evam sampurna niyantran
 Estimates of how much work can be done in Nadighati scheme and what is its expansion? Can be from those statistics that TVA Were published in 1958 on completion of 25 years of
 inamen se kuch aankade is prakaar hai : About five crore cubic concrete etc
 were used in these dams and 25 million cubic feet concrete was put into power houses and 1,30,000 tons of steel were used

 Under the Nadiaghati scheme, maps of the entire valley were prepared completely
 unke dwaara krishi utpaadan yojanaayen saath-saath banaai gayi or kaam chaalu kiya gaya
 Transport facilities increased by the waterways of rivers and the annual damage caused by floods was greatly reduced
 iskaa parinaam yah bhi hua ki us bhoomi kii, jo har saal badhgrast hoti thi, keemat ek saath bad gai
 Tva Says that a lot of cost money could be recovered in this way
 iske atirikt maanav jivan ko sukhad banane ke liye tarah-tarah ke aamod-pramod ke bahut se sthal banaae gaye, jaise saiyr-sapate ke liye bade-bade rashtriya park, tairne ke liye athwa nauka vihaar ke liye jhilein, skool, aadi
 All these things are used for the benefit of the society through the Nadiaghati scheme, because water, land and electricity are available in sufficient quantity
 kisi nadi ghati kii yojana ke safaleebhoot hone ke liye aavashyak yah hota he ki sampurna vikaskaarya prashasan kii drushti se ek hi sutara main bandhe hon
 For this reason, an autonomous administration is appointed by the Parliament in the form of legislation or a bill
 vah apane adhiniyamon ke anukool kaarysampadan main lag jaataa he, apni vitt niti apane-aap nirdhaarit karata he or pradeshik shasno se paraamarsh karte hue yojana kii purti karne main lag jaataa he
 While there are many more schemes that are versatile, they are not fully utilized because they are not seen as a single entity and there is a tussle between territorial administration and sometimes indecent situation

 Many other riverine schemes are going on in India

 is also mandatory

 The Nadiaghati scheme is the best way to plan and develop the planned natural resources in harmony with the natural division of the regions
 samay ke saath-saath is disha main maanav samaaj bhinn-bhinn deshon main pragati kar rahaa he or karata rahegaa
 But as per the requirement, the projections of the Nadiaghati schemes will also change, because with the development of atomic power, the depiction of development will also change and the multifarious demands of human beings will also increase a lot
 phir bhi nadighati yojanaon kii upadeyata main koi vishesh antar aane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Originally, the development of human culture has been mostly related to water since ages

 Till now this award has been conferred on the awards of the following litterateurs
 go
 maa
 pavaar marathi bhashaa ke vikhyath sahityakar hai
 a biography composed by him Maharshi Vitthal Ramji Shinde: He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2007 for his life and work
 vidyut motor ek vidyutyantric mashin he jo vidyut urja ko yantric urja main badalati he; arthath ise upyukt vidyut strot se jodne par yah ghoomane lagati he jisase isse judi mashin yaa yantra bhi ghoomane lagati he
 That is, it works the opposite of an electric generator which produces electrical energy by taking mechanical energy
 kuch motaren alag-alag paristhitiyon main motor yaa janarator dono kii tarah bhi kaam karti hai
 Electric motors are means of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy
 vidyut motor audyogic pragati kaa mahatvapurn suchak he
 It is a very simple and very useful machine
 udyogon main shaayad hi koi aisa prayojan ho jiske liye upyukt vidyut motor kaa chayan na kiya ja sake
 The basic purpose of electric motors is to generate relative speed between the stator and the rotor by generating electromagnetic force / force
 is prakaar vidyut motor, vidyut urja lekar yantric kaary karti he
 The Lorenz force exerted on the current drivers of the winding of the motor is expressed by the following equation: motor dwaara utpann yantric shakti Pem nimnlikhit sameekaran se di jaati he- Where the angular speed of the shaft should be in radians per second and t newton-meter
 raikhik motaron ke liye, Where f is in newtons and velocity v is in meters per second
 vidyut motor udyogon main ek adarsh pradhan chaalak he
 Most machines are powered by electric motors
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah he ki vidyut motaron kii dakshata duusare chaalkon kii tulana main unchi hoti he
 Also, his performance is often better than them
 vidyut motor pravartan tathaa niyantran ke drushtikon se bhi adarsh he
 Driving, or stopping the motor, and changing the speed can be done more easily than other drivers
 iskaa duurastha niyantran bhi ho saktaa he
 Electric motors have become so popular due to the ease of control
 vidyut motor anek kaaryon main prayukt ho sakate hai
 They can run large machines of several hundred horsepower and machines ranging from the smallest to horsepower
 udyogon ke atirikt ye krishi main bhi, kheton ke jotane, bone tathaa kaatane kii mashiinon ko or sinchai ke pampon ko chalaane ke liye, prayukt hote hai
 Machines of refrigeration, washing and other works are also run in these houses
 vidyut motor bhinn-bhinn prayojanon ke liye bhinn bhinn prayojanon ke liye bhinn bhinn prarupon ke bane hai
 They have simple controllers, from which many types of work can be taken
 sambharan ke anusaar paramparaagat rup se motor do prakaar ke ginaye jate rahe hai ham ynha sansofhan dekhnege- dishtdhaara motor evam prayavarti dhara motor 
 There are many types of both, according to their specific characteristics
 kintu samay ke saath yah vargeekaran kamjor pad gaya he kyonki universal motor e
si
 se bhi chal sakati he
 The development of power electronics has now turned the commutator out of the motors
 motaron kaa doosraa vargeekaran sincronas or acincronas ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 This is to some extent a more rational classification
 sincronas mashiinon kaa roter usee koniya chaal se chakkar katata he jis gati se us motor kii prayavarti dhara ke kaaran utpann chumbakeey kshetra gati karata he
 But in contrast the rotor of asynchronous motors rotates at a lower speed
 preran motor iskaa pramukh udhaaharan he
 Some of the major motors are as follows: disi motaren vahaan adhik upyogi hoti hai jahaan chaal-niyantran bahut mahatv rakhata he
 This is because their speed control can be done very easily
 yah vastav main cerise disi motor he jo asi evam disi dono se chalaayi ja sakati he
 The motor of the mixer used in homes is a universal motor
 iske atirikt railgadee kaa ingine khinchne ke liye univershal motor kaa hi upyog kiya jaataa he kyonki inaki chaal ke saath balaghurna ke badalane kaa sambandh is kaam ke liye bahut upyukt he
 This motor produces a lot of acceleration at low speeds, while the speed generated by it increases with increasing speed
 sabase-saamaanya prayavarti dhara motor preran motor he, jo preran ke siddhant par kaary karata he
 This motor is most commonly used due to which it is called the workhorse of industries
 isamen ghisne vaala koi avyav nahin he jisase yah bina marammat ke bahut dino tak chal saktaa he
 Most motors used in homes for general tasks and low power are single-phase induction motors, also known as fractional horsepower motors
 udhaaharan ke liye pankhons, dhulaai kii mashiinon ke motor aadi
 Reverse current motors also have field coils and armatures similar to direct current motors, but in some different form
 inamen do mukhya bhaag hote hai : ek to stater, jo sthir rahata he or doosraa roter ko ghumta he
 Reverse current motors are also of different types
 teen feji sincronas motor bahut kam upyog main aati he
 One of its main uses is to improve the power coefficient
 yah apane-aap start nahin hoti evam chalaanaa armbh karne ke liye kuch atirikt vyavastha kerani padati he
 But synchronous generators or alternators are used a lot and most of the world's electrical power is being generated by alternators
 yah motor kii laagat jyada nahin hoti he
 These days are being used in high speed trains
 aajkal inkaa upyog sthiti niyantran evam chaal-niyantran ke liye bahut hota he
 It is very easy to control them with the help of numerical bodies; Such as with the help of a microcontroller
 yadi chaal vyavasthaapan kaaphi vistrut paraas main karnaa ho, to shraag motor bahut upyukt hote hai
 In many places, operating characteristics of direct current, range motor is desirable
 isaki vyavastha karne ke liye prayavarti dhara motaron main bhi praytn kiya gaya he
 The alternating current range motor and the interchangeable motor provide similar characteristic features
 tulykaalik motor keval tulykaalik chaal par hi prachaalan kar sakate hai
 Therefore, where uniformity is required, these are ideal
 jis prakaar disht dhara janitr evam motor, vastut: ek hi mashin hai or donon ko kisi bhi rup main prayog karnaa sambhav he
 Similarly, synchronous motor is also, in fact, the form of alternating current generator, commonly called alternator, and it is possible to use both in any form
 iske prachaalan ke liye iske stater main prayavarti dhara sancharan tathaa roter main disht dhara uttejk donon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Use of these motors is somewhat limited
 disht dhara uttejan ke liye prayavartit kii bhanti hi inamen bhi ek uttejan ke liye prayavartit kii bhanti hi inamen bhi ek uttejk kii vyavastha hoti he
 The main advantage of these motors is that the power factor can also be increased by increasing the excitation
 at: visheshtya un udyogon main jahaan bahut se preran motor hone ke kaaran, athwa kisi or kaaran, se shaktigunank bahut kam ho jaataa he, vahaan tulykaalik motaron kii vyavastha kar shaktigunank ko sudhara ja saktaa he
 In many places, these motors are used only for power factor correction
 aisi dasha main inhen tulykaalik sandharitra kaha jaataa he
 In many places only one-way feeding is available
 vahaan ekakaleey motor prayog kiye jate hai
 Single-phase induction motors are very popular for small machines and household works
 bijli ke pankhons main bhi ekakaleey motor prayukt hote hai
 Similarly, single-motor motors are predominant in the washing machines, refrigerators and sewing machines etc
 ekakaleey motaron kii mukhya kathinaayee inke aarambh karne main hoti hai
 Some kind of art diversion is necessary to get started
 kala vipatan saadharantaya ek sahaayak kundali dwaara kiya jaataa he, jiske aripath main ek sandharitra diya hota he, jo sahaayak kundalan kii dhara ko mukhya kundalan kii dhara se lagbhag 10 vidyut degree visthapit kar detaa he
 This may cause the creation of rotational magnetic fields and the motor starts moving
 sandharitra ke paripath main rahane se motor kaa prachaalan shaktigunank bhi sudhar jaataa he
 Many small motors are universal and can be used in both direct current and alternating current
 vastut: ye shrenee motor hote hai, jinka prachaalan disht dhara evam prayavarti dhara donon main hi prayukt kiye ja sakate hai
 In fact, these are class motors, which can operate both in direct current and alternating current, but they can be made in very small sizes and are used only in certain applications
 metron tathaa duusare ukaranon main tathaa jahaan kisi vidyut raashi kaa maapan karnaa ho vahaan atyant chote aakaar ke motor prayukt hote hai
 Many small motors are also used for remote control, or for opening valves, etc
 motor kaa upree aavaran vibhinn paristhitiyon ke anusaar banaaya jaataa he
 Some motors are open type, in which their inner parts are visible in front, but in such motors there is a fear of getting dust
 atev ye khule sthanon main nahin prayukt kiye ja sakate
 But natural ventilation is good in such motors
 atev ye shighrata se garam nahin hone pate
 For this reason such motors are of relatively high capacity according to size
 jahaan motor ko khule sthanon main prachaalan karnaa padataa he vahaan dhul mitti ityadi kaa dar ho saktaa he, at: purnataya aavruth motor prayukt kiye jate hai
 The main difficulty in such motors is ventilation
 inkaa aavaran bhi aisa banaaya jaataa he ki vah adhiktam ooshmaa vistarit kar sake
 At the same time, there is a system of a fan mounted on the same tree, which can enter the ventilation air inside the motor and expand the heat produced in it
 adhikansh prayojanon ke liye ardh-paribaddh motor santoshjanak hote hai, jinamein motor ke drushtigochar honevaale bhaag jaali dwaara dhake rahete hai
 Thus, there are benefits of both the above types
 vishesh paristhitiyon ke liye vishesh prakaar ke aavaran banaae jate hai, jaise khaanon ke andar athwa visphotak vaataavaran main purnataya jwalarahit motor prayukt kiye jate hai
 Similarly some motors are made to work under water and their cover is designed to work and their cover is designed in such a way that water cannot get inside the motor
 or bhi bahut si vibhinn paristhitiyon main vibhinn prakaar ke aavaran banaae jate hai
 Many motors are attached directly to the load and in many cases they are attached by bar, gear or chain
 gear se chaalak evam chaalit mashiinon main lagbhag sthir chaal anupaat poshit kiya ja saktaa he or gear kram badalakar vibhinn chaalen bhi praapt kii ja sakati hai
 The machine can also be placed far enough away from the motor to transmit power through the strip, and can also run a common isha to which other machines are associated
 bade bade kaarkaanon main saadharantaya yahi vinyas hota he
 The main limitation to the capacity of motors is the increase of heat
 taap ke badhane par kshat hone kaa bhi bhay rahata he, tathaa haniyon ke bad jane se motor kii dakshata bhi kam ho jaati he
 Thus the motor cannot operate continuously
 adhikansh motor ek vishisht taap vruddhi ke liye kshamit hote hai, jo vidyutarodhi ke varg par nirbhar karata he
 Many motors are of "continuous capacity", which means that they can sustain a constant load, to a specific limit without heating
 bahut se motor keval alp kaal ke liye hi purna bhaar par prachaalan karte hai or baaki samay bahut kam bhaar par rahete hai athwa band rahete hai
 If the operation is fixed, low-capacity motors for such purposes only operate at full load for short periods of time and remain at or off load for the rest of the time
 yadi prachaalankram nishchit ho, to aise prayojanon ke liye kam kshamta kii motaren prayog kii ja sakati hai, jinka prachaalan tathaa kshamta alp samay ke liye hi nirdhaarit hoti he

 Open source software has a different relationship with intellectual property rights, so its importance cannot be denied
 ho saktaa he ki aane vaale kal main, soochna prodyogiki kii disha isi par nirbhar kare
 That is why it is absolutely necessary to know open source software, understand its importance, and assimilate the relationship with it and intellectual property rights

 In today's open source software, doing all the work done at the office, writing, going to the internet, giving different types of powerpoint presentation, listening to songs, watching dvds, blogging, or anything else that we all want to do Is as simple as proprietary software
