 This theory evolved from the concept of continental displacement, envisaged in the first decade of the twentieth century, when new evidence was discovered in the 1960s that strengthened the concept of continents being dynamic rather than static
 in saakshyon main sabase mahatvapurn hai purachumbakatv se sambandhit sakshya jinase sagar nital prasaran kii pushti hui
 The discovery of Sagar Nittal Varshan by Harry Hayes is believed to be the beginning of the rendering of this theory and scholars like Wilson, Morgan, mckenzie, Oliver, Parker etc
 contributed to its promotion by providing evidence in its favor

 These plates are floating on the semicircular layer of the asthenosphere at the bottom and are generally moving at a speed of about 10–40 mm / yr, although some have a velocity of 160 mm / yr

 In plate tectonics, the word tectonics is derived from the Greek language τεκτονικός meaning to relate to construction

 According to this theory, the lithosphere, located as the upper layer of the earth, consisting of the crust and some part of the upper mantle, is divided into several pieces called plates

 Apart from this, there are some medium and small size plates

 The English philosopher Francis Bacon first marked this resemblance with the study of exact maps, with the cartographer Abraham Ortelius saying in 1596 that the Americas broke apart from Europe and Africa, and the German theologian Theodor Lilienthal's statement of Ortelius in 1756 Attempted to confirm on the basis of a biblical statement

 Wagner was the first to use the term "continental displacement", following the same principle of Wagner that the development of plate tectonics was possible, although his ideas were also rejected by scholars for nearly half a century until evidence was available in the 1960s
 
 or mahadwipiya visthaapan Due to the mobility of the plates, there are three types of edges or borders: is prakaar ke kinaaron ke sahare do platen ek duusare kii ore gati karti hai or takaraakar unamem se baari plate halaki plate ke neeche kshepit hoti he
 This part, which is twisted downward, goes deep and melts and converts into magma due to the excess of heat and pressure
 jis gaharaai par yah ghatana hoti he use kshepan mandal yaa beniof zone kehete hai
 With the help of such edges, due to pressure of the landowners, they turn and form mountains

 Where two plates move opposite to each other, that is, they move away from each other, magma rises up from the bottom to form a new plate

 Rift valleys are formed when this shore lies on a continent

 The protective edge is the one with which the two platens are moving, rubbing each other, that is, neither descending nor converging

 Plate tectonics theory offers the newest explanation of the construction of fine mountains

 According to this theory it is believed that the series of mountains on the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean Sea are the result of tectonic events in the Tertiary era in which they were formed by compression between the African and European plates of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea

 Their efforts influenced changes that improved the social welfare of those often referred to as Dalits
 november 1980 main, indira gandhi ne tiruvanantpuram main kaudiyaar varg main ayyanki kii murti kaa anaavaran kiya
 Ayyanki was born on 28 August 1863 in Venganur, Thiruvananthapuram, Travancore
 vah ayayan or maala se paidaa hue aath bacchon main se sabase bade the, jo asprishyon ke pulayaar samudaay ke sadsy the
 Although the family was relatively well off compared to other Pulayars, 5 acres of land was given by a grateful landlord, children were encouraged to adopt the traditional occupation of agriculture
 pulayaar samudaay ke sadsy aam taur par is samay gramin das the
 The region where Ayankali lived, which now forms part of the state of Kerala, was particularly influenced by social divisions during his lifetime and described by Swami Vivekananda as the "madhouse" of the castes
 pulyrs ko rajya ke logon ke nimnatam samooh ke rup main mana jaataa tha or ve shaktishaalee nair jati ke sadasyon se damankaaree bhedbhaav se buree tarah se peedit the
 Robin Jeffrey, a professor specializing in modern history and politics in India, quotes the wife of a Christian missionary who wrote in 1860 of the complex social code is saamaajik anyaay se peedit ayyanki ko samaan vichaar vaale pulaayan doston ke saath shaamil hone kaa kaaran ban gaya
 These young people gathered at the end of their workday to sing and dance to folk music that opposed the situation
 kuch log us samooh ko banane main shaamil ho gaye jisane kabhi bhi avasar paidaa hone par upree jatiyon ke sadasyon ko chunauti di or dhamkee di, kabhi-kabhi shaareerik rup se hamalaa karte the
 His popularity earned him the names of Urapillai and Muthapulai
 ayyaankaali ne 1888 main chellam se vivaah kiya
 The couple had seven children
 1893 main, ayayanki, paaramparik rup se nair se jude kapadon main uttejit hone ke liye taiyaar thim, ne un saamaajik sammelnon ko ninda kiya jo kam jatiyon or asprishyon par lagu hue the, jo unhone kharide gaye bail gaadi main sadak par savaar hokar
 Both the act of procurement and traveling on a road that traditionally protected the upper castes was a significant challenge
 avagya ke isi tarah ke kaary main, unhone nedamungad main bazaar main pravesh kiya
 These protests, described by Nisar and Kanadasamy as "claiming public space", strengthened the resolution, among others from the oppressed communities of Travancore, leading to protests elsewhere in Kazakkutam
 nirantar virodh pradarshnon kaa nateeja, jo kabhi-kabhi hinsak ho jaataa he or chaliyar dangon ke rup main janaa jaataa he, yah tha ki 1900 tak pulyrs ko rajya main zyaadaatar sadakon kaa upyog karne kaa adhikaar mila tha, haalanki ve abhi bhi un logon se pratibandhit the hindu mandiron ke liye netritv kiya
 Later, in 1904, Ayyanki reformists were inspired to listen to speeches by Ayya Swamik
 tamil samudaay kii yah hindu sanyasi jati vibhaagon ko todane kii aavashyaktaa kaa prachaar kar rahi thi kyonki unhone sochaa tha ki aisa karne se hindu dharm se isai dharm main parivartit hone vaale logon kii sankhya simit ho jaaegi
 a branch of the Brahma Nishtha Matta organization of Swamikala was established that year by Ayyanaki and some friends of Venganur
 ayyanki ne ejhava jati ke samakaleen saamaajik sudhaarak narayan guru kii gatividhiyon se bhi prerana lee, haalanki donon purush apane darshan or vaastaviktaa main badalane ke sadhano main bhinn the
 Narayana Guru had attempted to forge an alliance between the Ezhavas and untouchable communities such as the Pulayars, but there were violent opposition to ideas from his brothers and the Pulayars remained ruthless until the rise of Ayyanaki
 ayyanki ne bhi shiksha tak pahunch main sudhaar kii maang kii
 Some pulliers had access from the mid-nineteenth century through the activities of the Colonial Missionary Society and the London Missionary Society
 isai dharm main parivartan aise skulon main upasthiti ke liye ek shart thi, or aise maamle the jahaan pulyrs ne shikshakon kii aapurti karne kii laagat main yogadan dene kii peshkash kii thi
 }} However, Ayyanki, who was illiterate, believed that education should be available to all children and meant that government schools should allow access to untouchables
 sarkaar british aupniveshik prashasan par prabhaav daalane ke prayaas main pehle se hi saamaajik kalyaan ke drushtikon ko aadhunik banane kaa prayaas kar rahi thi ki is kshetra ko jodne kii jarurat nahin thi
 After 1895 several public schools were opened for untouchable communities but the right to primary education was limited in scope
 1904 main shiksha kaa rajya vitt poshan prabhavi ho gaya lekin sarkaar ne skulon ko in asprishy logon ko 1907 main pravesh karne ke aadesh die jane ke baad bhi sthaneey adhikariyon ko ise manaa karne ke tareeke khoje
 That year, helped by the experience gained from organizing the Brahma Nita Mattam, Ayyanki founded the Sadhu Jan Paripal Sangh, which campaigned to access schools and raise funds to establish a Pullair-run school in the interim
 isane hinduon or isaayiyon donon se samarthan aakarshith kiya
 Ayyanki's attempt to enroll a Pulaire girl in a government school led to eventual violent acts by the upper castes against the community and the burning of the school building in Ortambalam village

 In 'boond and Samudra', 'boond' symbolizes the individual and 'samudra' is the symbol of society
 ek or rup main is naam kii pratikatmakataa sarthak siddh hoti he
 The author has chosen Lucknow for the narrative area in this novel, and especially the streets in the chowk
 ek mohalle ke chitra main lekhak ne bhartiya samaaj ke bahut se roopon ke darshan kara diye hai
 In this way, the attempt to introduce 'samudra' through the introduction of 'drops' is symbolized
 is upanyaas main vyakti or samaaj ke antarsambandhon kii khoj vyapak falak par hua he
 The society described in this novel is immediately after the independence of the country
 nagar ji ne chithran ke liye ise lakhanu ke ek mohalle chowk main kendrit kiya he
 The main characters in its story are - Sajjan, Vanakanya, Mahipal and Nagin Chand Jain aka Colonel

 Vanakanya is a conservative, active-minded young woman of the free mind
 mahipal samaajwaad kaa dikhaava karne vaala niskriy lekhak he or naginchand jain urf karnal vyavsaai hote hue bhi deen-dukhiyon kii sahaayta main tatpar rahane vaala sakriy kaaryakarta he
 Along with all this, the amazing patra of antiquity, superstition and extreme sharpness, as well as the support of serene compassion and nonchalantly justification is in the form of the novel

 vanakanya se usne antarjaatiy vivaah kiya tha or vichaaron ke saath-saath ghatnakramon ke kaaran bhi vah nari kii niyati evam maanviya aasthaa ke gambhir sawaalon tak pahunchataa he

 Despite the effort to adopt new ideas, the practical depiction of how feudal rites deprive a person of taking and taking meaningful direction and active steps shows the creative skills of the novel
 lekhak mahipal jaise jivan main asafal paatr kaa chithran bhi atyant sajiv he or tai kaa samgr charitra-chithran to itnaa bahurupi, paripurna evam susambaddh he ki use hindi katha-sahitya kii adwitiya paatr-sristiyon main se ek mana gaya he

 unka maananaa he ki in sab dosha ke hote hue bhi 'buund or samudr' ek sundar upanyaas he
 The writer has pulled the curtain of complacency from the top of Indian society and has revealed the grunt within it to everyone
 'buund or samudr' main jitna saamaajik anubhav sanchit he, vah use apane dhang kaa vishwakosh bana detaa he

 He considers it to be undeniable in the most important novels of the last ten-fifteen years, despite the possibility that it may be the masterpiece of that era

 In Windows 95, Windows Explorer offers a browsing mode where each folder will open a new window in a special file manager style showing its contents
 The size and appearance of the folder is automatically set according to the contents of the newly opened folder
 udhaaharan ke liye, do filon vaala ek folder, das filon vaale folder kii tulana main ek chote windo main khulata he
 In addition, when a folder contains hundreds of files, that folder will automatically display in the "list" view
 This browsing mode is reminiscent of Windows 3
x's program manager
 vindos 95 sabase nikatatam vindos explorer tha jo mekintosh finder ke samaan rang main special fil manager banataa he
 In later versions of Windows Explorer, much of its functionality was disabled by default, and instead preferred a 'single-window "navigation design, a philosophy that later found its way into Mac OS X
 vindos explorer ne object-oriented yuzar interfes ke vichaaron kaa upyog kiya or prayek fil vastu ko extencible context menu ke saath pradaan kiya
 The basic idea behind the Context menu was to provide powerful users with a more efficient and elegant way of executing file-related commands

 An address bar has also been added to Windows Explorer, in which a user can directly write the directory path and will be reached in that folder
 It acts as a URL bar for Internet addresses; Web pages open in the main part of the window
 ek anya visheshta jo internet explorer praudyogiki par aadhaarit thi vah thi anukulit folder

 For certain file types, such as media files, a preview is also displayed on the left pane
 vindos 2000 explorer main, dhwani or video filon ke ek purvalokan ke liye ek interective media player shaamil he
 However, such previewers can be activated in Windows m Me and Windows XP through the use of third-party shell extensions, as the update allows Windows Explorer, custom thumbnail preview, and tooltip handlers
 difolt fil tultip, fil sheershak, lekhak, vishay or tippaniyon ko pradarshit karata he; is metadata ko vishesh NTFS stream dwaara padhaa ja saktaa he, yadi vah fil NTFS volum par he, yaa phir ek OLE sanrachit bhandaaran stream dwaara, yadi vah fil ek sanrachit bhandaaran dastauez he
 All Microsoft Office since Office 95 use structured storage, so their metadata is displayable in the Windows 2000 Explorer default tooltip
 fil shortkat, tippaniyon ko bhi store kar saktaa he jo tultip ke rup main pradarshit hote hai jab mouse us shortkat ke upar ghumta he
 The right-hand pane, which typically only informs files and folders, can also be customized

 Significant changes were made to Windows Explorer in Windows XP, both format and functional
 Microsoft specifically focused on making Explorer more discoverable and task-based, as well as adding many features that reflected the increased use of computers as a "digital hub"
 vindos sarwar 2003 main vindos explorer main ve sabhi suvidhaayen shaamil hai jo vindos XP main hai, lekin task pen or khoj saathi, difolt rup se aksham hai
 The task pane is displayed on the left side of the window instead of the traditional folder tree view
 yah upyogkarta ke liye saamaanya kriyaaon or sthalon kii suchi prastut karata he jo vartmaan nirdeshika yaa chaynit fil ke liye praasangik hai
 For example, when in a directory with the most images, a set of "picture tasks" are shown, which go online to display these images as a slide show, print, or order a print order

 Media Bar was only available in Windows XP RTM
 har folder main "fil and folder task" bhi hota he, jo nae folder banane, sthaneey network par kisi folder ko saajha karne, ek web site ke liye filein yaa folders ko prakashit karne ke vikalpon ke saath-saath anya saamaanya kaaryon kii peshkash karata he, jaise fil yaa foulder ko copy karnaa, hataanaa, yaa mitaanaa

 Below "file and Folder Tasks" is "other Places" and a link to other common locations such as "my Computer", "control Panel" and "my Documents"
 This changes depending on which folder the user was in, leading Microsoft to criticize that it has not been consistent in displaying navigation options
 "adar places" ke neeche ek "ditels" falak he jo atirikt jaankaree detaa he - aam taur par fil aakaar or taarikh, lekin jo fil prakaar, ek thambanel purvavlokan, lekhak, chhavi aayam, yaa anya vivaran ke aadhaar par hota he
 The "folder" button on the Windows Explorer toolbar toggles between the traditional tree view of folders and the task pane
 upyogkarta task pen se chhutkaaraa paa sakate hai yaa use punah behaal kar sakate hai jiske liye unhen is anukram kaa upyog karnaa hoga: tuls - folder opshan - general - sho kaaman task / yuz windos clasik folder
 In an effort to make search more engaging and friendly, Microsoft introduced the animated "search Companion"; The default character is a puppy named Rover with three other characters also available
 in khoj saathi kii samanta microsoft offis ke offis assistant se kaaphi had tak he, yahaan tak ki "chaal" or dhwani ke maamle main bhi
 The search capability itself is largely similar to Windows Me and Windows 2000, with one key feature: search can only be directed to search for files that are categorized as "documents" or "images, music, and videos
" "has been done in; This feature is notable largely because of how Windows determines which files can be classified under these categories
 fil prakaar kii ek praasangik suchi banaae rakhane ke liye, vindos explorer, microsoft ke saath judata he or XML filon ke ek set ko downlod karata he jo paribhaashit karti he ki ye fil prakaar kya hai
 Although harmless in itself, the feature has attracted the attention of many privacy advocates and users with firewall software installed, who believe that it is unnecessary for Windows to connect to Microsoft's servers every time they perform a local search
 vindos XP, ek filmstrip drishy pradaan karte hue explorer main chhavi purvavlokan main sudhaar karata he
 Images can be accessed in a convenient way via the "back" and "previous" buttons, and a pair of "rotate" buttons provide 90-degree clockwise and counterclockwise rotation of images
 filmstrip drishy ke alaava, ek 'thambanel' mod he jo folder main chitron ko thambanel aakaar main pradarshit karata he
 a folder that contains pictures will also display a thumbnail of four images above the larger folder icon

 Windows Explorer includes significant changes from previous versions of Windows such as improved filtering, sorting, grouping, and stacking
 Combined with integrated desktop search, Windows Explorer allows users new ways to find and deploy their files, such as stacks
 The "stacks" view groups files according to criteria as specified by the user
 vindos explorer main dikhaai gai filon ko filter karne ke liye stacks ko clic kiya ja saktaa he
 It also has the ability to protect searches as virtual folders or search folders
 ek search folder bas ek XML fil he, jo khoj ko is rup main bhandaarit rakhata he jise vindos kii khoj pranali dwaara istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 When accessed, the search is performed and the results are collected and presented in a virtual folder
 saamagree kii chantai ke samay, chantai kram lagaataar arohi yaa avarohi nahin bana rahata he
 Each property has a preferred sorting type
 udhaaharan ke liye, sort bai date kaa difolt kram avarohi hota he or saise kaa bhi
 lekin nem or tip kaa difolt kram arohi he
 Windows Explorer includes modifications to the view of files on a computer
 vista or sarwar 2008 ke liye vindos explorer main ek nai atirikt suvidha he ditels pen, jo chaynit fil yaa folder se sambandhit metadata tathaa jaankariyon ko dikhaata he
 The details pane also displays the thumbnail of the file or an icon of the file type if the file does not contain visual information
 iske alaava, fil ke bare main adhik jaankaree dene ke liye vibhinn chhaviyon ko thambanel main prastut kiya jaataa he, jaise ki ek chhavi fil ke chaaron ore ek tasviir frem, yaa ek video fil par ek filmstrip
 thambanel ko bada kiya ja saktaa he
 The details pane allows changes to some literal form of metadata such as 'author' and 'title' within files that support them within Windows Explorer
 ek nae prakaar kaa metadata jise tags kaha jaataa he, upyogkartaaon ko suvidhajanak vargeekaran or punah prapti ke liye dastavejon main varnanaatmak shabdon ko jodne kii anumati detaa he
 Some files support free metadata and allow users to define new types of metadata for their files
 out-of-da-box, vindos vista or vindos sarwar 2008, microsoft offis kaa or or adhikansh audio or video filon kaa samarthan karte hai
 Support for other file types can however be added by writing special software to retrieve metadata at the request of the shell
 ek fil kii vaikalpik stream main keval NTFS par sangrahit metadata ko ab fil kii property ke 'samari' teb dwaara na dekha ja saktaa he or naa hi sampadit kiya ja saktaa he
 Instead, all metadata is stored inside the file, so that it will always travel with the file, regardless of the file system
 vindos vista or windos sarwar 2008 main vindos explorer ek nae leout kaa parichay karaata he
 Windows xp's taskpane has been replaced by a toolbar at the top and a navigation pen on the left
 nevigation pen main aam taur par abhigamit foulder or pripopulated search foulder shaamil hote hai
 Seven different views are available for viewing files and folders, namely, lists, details, small icons, medium icons, large icons, XL icons or tiles
 Automatic folder type discovery automatically detects the contents of a folder and displays precise detail settings
 fil or foulder kriyaayein jaise ki cat, copy, paste, andu, ridu, delit, rinem or propertiz ko ek dropadown menu main nirmit kiya jaataa he jo tab prakat hota he jab organaise batan clic kiya jaataa he
 It is also possible to change the layout of the Explorer window using the Organize button

 ditels pen ke alaava, privyuu pen filon ke purvavlokan kii anumati detaa he
 In addition, Explorer can provide a preview for any image format if the required codec for that format is installed in the Windows Imaging Component
 nevigation ko aasaan banane ke liye adress baar ko ek bradcrambs baar se pratisthapit kiya gaya he
 It shows the full path to the current location
 baar-baar back batan dabaane ke bajaay, path padanukram main kisi bhi sthaan par clic karne se upyogkarta us str par pahunch jaataa he
 This is the same as possible in Windows XP, in which any folder was selected from the list of previously accessed folders by pressing a small downward arrow next to the "back"
 antim item ke dayee ore ke tir kaa upyog karte hue vartmaan folder ke kisi sabafolder main janaa bhi sambhav he, yaa isi ke daaen taraf ke sthaan par clic karke is maarg ko swayan copy yaa sampadit kiya ja saktaa he
 As is the case with many other Windows Vista applications built by Microsoft, here too the menu bar is hidden by default
 alt kunjee ko dabaane se menu baar dikhaai detaa he
 Check boxes in Windows Explorer allow the selection of multiple files
 sabhi drive par rikt or prayukt spes ko kshaitij suchak baar main dikhaaya jaataa he
 Icons of various sizes are supported - 16 x 16 24 x 24 32 x 32 48, x 48 64, x 64 96, x, 128 96 x 128 and 256 x 256
 Windows Explorer allows icons using a slider
 You can make it bigger or smaller, or it can also be done by pressing the Ctrl key using the mouse wheel
 iske alaava, vindos vista or sarwar 2008 or windos XP ke liye vindos internet explorer 7 kii relies ke saath, internet explorer ab vindos explorer ke saath ekikrut nahin he
 Unlike the older version, Windows Explorer does not host Internet Explorer controls in its own process, but instead initiates a new process when needed
 vindos vista or sarwar 2008 main vindos explorer web pannon ko pradarshit nahin karata he or IE7 ek fil manager ke rup main istemaal kaa samarthan nahin karata, haalanki ek vyakti use alag se aavashyaktaa ke rup main shuru karegaa
 When copying or transferring files from one folder to another, if two files have the same name, there is now an option to rename that file; In previous versions of Windows, the user was prompted to choose either a replacement or to cancel the file transfers
 iske alaava, fil ke punah namakaran ke samay naam, explorer bina ekstansion ko chune hi fil ke naam ko pradarshit karata tha
 Renaming multiple files is now quicker because pressing the tab automatically names the existing file or folder and opens the text field of the file name to change the name for the next file
 Shift + Tab dabaane se upar ke tareeke se naam badalane kii anumati milti he
 Added support for burning data on dvds in addition to CD and DVD-RAM using version 2

 agar chal rahaa anuprayog in kriyaaon ko ifileinuse interfes ke madhyam se ujagar kar detaa he, to vindos explorer, ek locd fil se saamana hone par upyogkarta ko fil ko band karne kii yaa dialog bakse se hi us anuprayog main jane kii anumati detaa he
 The ability to customize the layout and buttons on the toolbar has been removed from Windows Vista's Explorer, as previously it had the ability to add a password to a ZIP file
 explorer main us tulbaar batan ko bhi hataa diya gaya he jisase vartmaan foulder se ek folder upar yaa neeche jaaya jaataa tha 
 haalanki menu or keyboard shortkat se abhi bhi puri tarah uplabdh hote hue cat, copy, paste, andu, delit, propertiz ke tulbaar batan or kuch anya ab uplabdh nahin hai
 The menu bar is also hidden by default, but is still available when you press the Alt key, or when you change its visibility in the layout options
 Many other features have been removed, such as showing the size on the status bar without selecting it, storing metadata in the NTFS secondary stream, the icolumnprovider interface that allowed adding customized volumes to Explorer and using desktop
ini Track folder background customization
 "managing peyars of web pejes and folders" ke vikalp ko bhi hataa diya gaya he or upyogkarta ke paas vista ko yah bataane kaa koi rasta nahin he ki ek 
html fil or ek hi naam vaala folder jise IE se ek puraa web pej sahejte samay nirmit kiya gaya tha use pruthak rup se sanbhaalanaa chahie, yani, aap html fil ko bina mitaae folder ko nahin mitaa sakate

 Now you have to highlight the folder you want to search and enter your keyword in the search field in the top right and until the computer has finished its search in the entire folder based on that one keyword you Cannot enter other search criteria
 Only then the "advanced Search" button will appear and will allow you to enter further search parameters
 This situation can be ignored
 vindos explorer main F3 kunjee hit he
 This brings up the "advanced Search" box
 windos 7 or vindos sarwar 2008 R2 main vindos explorer libraries, kaa samarthan karata he
 Libraries are virtual folders that are described in a 
library-ms file that aggregates content from different locations - including the network system's shared folders if the shared folders are indexed by the host system - and they are integrated into a single view
 Presents in sthaneey system par khoj ke alaava, kisi librori main search karne se prashn apane aap duurastha system se sanghabaddh ho jaataa he, isliye duurastha system par filein bhi khoj ke antargat aati hai
 Unlike search folders, libraries are supported by a physical location that allows files to be saved to libraries
 aisi filein paardarshee rup se samarthak bhautik folder main saheji jaati hai
 The default save location for a library can be configured by one user and also the default view layout for each library
 Libraries are typically stored in the Libraries Special folder, which allows them to be displayed on the navigation pane
 difolt rup se, windos 7 main ek nae prayokta khate main alag-alag fil prakaar ke liye chaar libraries hoti hai: document, music, pikchars or video
 unhen in sambandhit fil prakaar ke liye upyogkarta ke profil folder or saath hi saath computer ke sambandhit saarvajanik folders ko shaamil karne ke liye configar kiya jaataa he
 In addition to collecting multiple locations for storage, libraries enable arrangement views and search filter optimization
 arrengement vus aapako metadata ke aadhaar par librari kii saamagree ko dekhne kii anumati detaa he
 For example, selecting the "by Month" view in the picture library will display images in the stack, where each stack will display a month's photos based on the date on which they were drawn
 music librari main, "bai artist" vyuu, aapke sangrah main kalakaaron ke aadhaar par geeton ko prastut karegaa or ek kalakaar ke dher main khoj karne se praasangik album pradarshit honge
 Search filter optimization is a new feature in the search box of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Explorer
 jab upyogkarta khoj box main clic karata he, to uske neeche ek menu aata he jo haal main kii gai khojon ko darshata he or saath hi saath suzav dete hue adwanced queri sintex filter ko dikhaata he jisamen upyogkarta likh sakate hai
 When one is selected, that menu updates the possible values for that property and the list is based on the current location and other parts of the already typed question
 udhaaharan ke liye, "tag" filter kaa chayan yaa search box main "tag:" tip karne se sambhavit tag maanon ko pradarshit kiya jayega jo khoj parinaam ko waapas karegaa
 Arrangement views and search filter devices are database-supported features that require all locations in the library to be indexed by the Windows Search service
 Local disk space must be indexed by the local indexer and when they are included in a library the Windows Explorer will automatically add locations for the indexing scope
 Remote locations can be indexed by the indexer on another Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 machine, on a Windows machine running Windows Search 4, or on any other device that implements the MS-WSP remote query protocol
 vindos explorer, bahya data sroton ke liye sanghabaddh khoj kaa samarthan karata he, jaise custom database, yaa web seva, jo web par ujagar hai or opensearch paribhaasha ke madhyam se varnit hai

 Windows Explorer features, such as preview and thumbnail, also work with the results of a federated search
 vindos vista ke samaan, vindos 7 main kai suvidhaon ko vindos explorer se hataa diya gaya he jaise ki bandhanevaala folder pen, saajha item ke liye overle iken ko, ekal windo aakaar or avasthiti kaa yaad rakhana, states baar par rikt discs sthaan, cmand baar par iken, auto arenge or aline tu grid ko niskriy karne kii kshamta, ditels vyuu ko chhodkar anya vyuu ke liye sourt baar, ditels vyuu main sampoorn pankti ke chayan ko niskriy karne kii kshamta, swat: kshaitij scrol or nevigation pen main scrolbaar or edit menu se chhaantate samay chayan ko banaae rakhane kii kshamta
 Windows Explorer can be expanded to support non-default functionality through Windows Shell Extensions, COM objects that extend functionality to Windows Explorer
 shell ekstansion, shell ekstansion handler, tulbaar, yaa namasthaan ekstansion ke rup main ho sakate hai jo kuch folderon ko ek special foulder ke rup main pastut karne kii anumati dete hai
 Windows Explorer up to Windows XP allows metadata for files to be added as an NTFS alternate data stream, separate from the data stream for the file
 shell dwaara kii jane vaali karrwai ko sanshodhit karne ke liye, shell dwaara shell ekstansion handler se pehle hi sawaal kiye jate hai
 They can be associated on a per-file type - where they will appear only when a specific action occurs on a specific file type - or on a global basis - that are always available
 yah shell nimnlikhit ekstansion handler kaa samarthan karata he: The namespace extension is used by the explorer to either display some data - which are not retained as files - in a folder-like view or to present data in a form that is from their organization on the file system Is different
 is suvidha kaa upyog relational fil system dwaara kiya ja saktaa he jaise liquidfolders yaa Tabbles, durbhaagyashaalee microsoft winfs ke clon, vishesh foulder, jaise vindos explorer main maai computer or network plases ko is tareeke se karyanvit kiya jaataa he or usee tarah se explorer vyuu ko bhi, jo mobile phone yaa digital camera main khoje jane ke yogya banaate hai
 Source control systems that use Explorer to browse source repositories also use namespace extensions to allow Explorer to browse modifications
 namasthaan vistaar ko lagu karne ke liye, ipersistfolder, ishellview, ishellfolder, ishellbrowser or iolewindow antarfalak ko lagu karne or panjikrut karne kii jarurat he
 The implementation provides logic to navigate the data store as well as to describe the presentation
 vindos explorer, jaisi aavashyaktaa hogi vaisaa COM object kaa drushtaant degaa
 While Windows Explorer exposes extensibility natively as a COM interface, the 
NET Framework can be used to write extensions, using the COM Interope functionality of the 
NET Framework
 While Microsoft itself provides extensions - such as Photo Info tools - that are written using the 
NET Framework, they currently recommend against writing managed shell extensions, as only one instance of the CLR can be loaded per process

 abhyamudra ek mudra he jo bhay se mukti or suraksha kii bhaavana kaa dyotak he
 It is found in the idols of all the ancient religions of India

 It is one of the most ancient currencies
 gisha ek chini-japani shabd jiskaa arth he, 'sukhkar gunyukta'
 In Japan, the term is used for singing and dancing kumaris who entertain people on social occasions and in tea houses etc
 gisha banane kii icchhuk ladakiyon ko bahut kam avasthaa main hi geet or nrity ke saath saath uthne baithne tathaa shishtachar kii shiksha di jaati he
 One thing to note in this regard is that Geisha is not considered a husband in any stage
 bharat main devdasiyon ko jo sthaan mila tha vahi gishaaon ko mila kaha ja saktaa he
 But there are many distinct differences between the two
 devdasiyon kaa mukhya kaary devtaa kii seva tha, jabaki gisha kaa kaary mandir aadi kii safai tathaa sajja main sahaayta dene ke atirikt spasht rup se vyaktiyon kaa manoranjan karnaa he, chaahe ve vyakti bhakt hon yaa na ho
 After the training of geishas is over, they are appointed by signing their terms, but they cannot get freedom in any way other than marriage

 Education is less tax on 4 police stations
 isamen andeh nahin ki yah purushpradhan samaaj kii ek shoshak pratha he
 This practice is getting up with the women getting equal share in the economy
 parivaar saadharantaya pati, patni or bacchon ke samooh ko kehete hai, kintu duniya ke adhikansh bhaagon main vah sammilit vaasavale rakt sambandhiyon kaa samooh he jisamen vivaah or dattak pratha dwaara sweekrut vyakti bhi sammilit hai
 In all societies, children are born and brought up in the family
 bacchon kaa sanskaar karne or samaaj ke aachaar vyavhaar main unhen dikshit karne kaa kaam mukhya rup se parivaar main hota he
 Through this, the cultural heritage of the society is transferred from one generation to another
 vyakti kii saamaajik maryaada bahut kuch parivaar se hi nirdhaarit hoti he
 Male-female sexual relationships are mainly fixed within the family
 audyogic sabhyataa se utpann jansankul samaajon or nagaron ko yadi chhod diya jaae to vyakti kaa parichay mukhyat: uske parivaar or kul ke aadhaar par hota he
 Although there are many distinctions of the family in terms of composition, size, relationship and work in different regions and different periods of the world, these above mentioned tasks are universal and universal
 usamen desh, kaal, paristhiti or pratha aadi ke bhed sa ek yaa anek pidiyon kaa or ek yaa anek danpatiyon athwa pati-patniyon ke samoohon kaa hona sambhav he, uske sadsy ek paariwarik anushaasan vyavastha ke atirikt pati or patni, bhai or bahan, pitamah or pautra, chachaa or bhattije, saas or putravadhu jaise sambandhon tathaa kartavyon evam adhikaron se paraspar aabaddh, anya saamaajik samoohon ke sandarbh main ek ghanishtatam antarang samooh ke rup main rahete hai
 Within the family, the division of sex between men and women is also universal and time-bound
 striyon kaa adhikansh samay ghar main vyateet hota he
 Making food, taking care of children and cleaning the house and sewing clothes etc
 are such tasks which come in the female part
 purush bahari tathaa adhik shram ke kaary karata he, jaise kheti, vyapaar, udyog, pashuchaaran, shikaar or ladaai aadi
 Even then, this division is not same in all societies, it is difficult to make even a large general list because in many societies women also take part in activities like farming and hunting
 yo Family forms are closely related to forms of marriage
 levis margan aadi vikasvaadiyon kaa mat he ki maanav samaaj kii praarambhik avasthaa main vivaah pratha nahin thi or purna kamachar prachlit tha
 This was followed by a state of youth marriage, polyandry, polyandry and monogamy or monogamy in the social development
 vastut: bahuvivaah or ekapatnitv kii pratha asabhy or sabhy sabhi samaajon main pai jaati he
 Therefore, this view does not appear to be evidence
 maanav shishu ke paalan poshan ke liye lambii avadhi apekshit he or pehle bachein kii baalyavastha main hi anya chote bachche utpann hote rahete hai
 Mother's care in pregnancy and obstetric care is necessary
 phir, pashuon kii bhanti manushya main rati kii koi vishesh ritu nahin he
 Therefore, probably in the beginning of human society, either the entire community or a group of husband, wife and children was the family
 maanav vaigyanikon ko koi aisa samaaj nahin mila jahaan vivaah sambandh parivaar ke andar hi hote hon, at: pitristhaneey parivaar main patni ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main pati ko atirikt sadsyta pradaan kii jaati he
 In the couple's family, husband and wife together establish their separate household
 kintu adhikansh samaajon main yah parivaar brihattar kautumbik samooh kaa ang mana jaataa he or jivan ke anek prasangon main parivaar par brihattar kautubik samooh kaa, ghanisht sambadh ke atirikt, niyantran hota he
 In industrialized countries like the USA, there has been a multiplicity of couples in place of a family of couples
 yadhyapi vahaan kaa samaaj pitruvansheey he, phir bhi yugal parivaar vahaan kisi ek brihattar kutumb kaa ang nahin mana jaataa
 The couple consists of a husband wife and, on birth, their unmarried children
 sammilit pariwaron main inke atirikt vivaahit bachche or unki santan, vivaahit bhai athwa bahan or unke bachche saath rah sakate hai
 The circumference of blood relatives in the included family is different in different societies
 bharat jaise desh main ek sammilit parivaar main saadhaarant: 10-12 sadsy hote hai, kintu kuch pariwaron main sadasyon kii sankhya 50-60 yaa 100 tak hoti he
 Families have different forms and types based on different forms of marriage, lineage, ownership and authority
 matrusthaneey parivaar main pati apni patni ke ghar kaa sthaayee yaa asthaayee sadsy banataa he, jabaki pitristhaneey parivaar main patni pati ke ghar jaakar rahati he
 Maternal families are generally matriarchal and patrilineal families are patrilineal
 bahudhaa parivaar kii sampatti kaa swaamitv pitristhaneey parivaar main purush ko or matrusthaneey parivaar main nari ko praapt he
 The eldest child is usually the heir to the property
 kintu yah aavashyak nahin he
 In the tribe like Garo of India, only the smallest girl is the owner of the family property
 anek samaajon main parivaar ke sabhi stri yaa purush sadasyon main swamitv nihit hota he or kuch main purush tathaa stri donon ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikaar praapt he
 Family rule is ruled by men in most societies
 antar itnaa he ki pitruvansheey pariwaron main saadhaarant: pita athwa ghar kaa sabase bada purush or matruvansheey pariwaron main mamaa yaa mata kaa anya sabase bada raktasambandhi ghar kaa mukhiya hota he
 Therefore, in most parts of the world and in societies, male dominance is found
 sansar main daanpaty jivan main praaia: ekapatnitv hi sabase adhik prachlit he, yadhyapi anek samaajon main purushon ko ek se adhik patniyaan rakhane kii bhi chhot he
 In contrast, in the Toda and Khas tribes and in some regions of Tibet, there is a practice of polyandry and a type of youth marriage
 isi prakaar bharat main khaasi, gaaro or america main hopi, hedia jaisi janajatiyaan bhi hai jo matrusthaneey or matruvansheey hai
 In these forms of marriage there is a difference in the composition and form of the family
 aadhunik audyogic kranti ke falswaroop parivaar kii rachana or kaaryon main gambhir parivartan parilakshith hue hai
 In all earlier societies, the family was the most important and fundamental institution of society
 jivan kaa adhikansh vyapaar parivaar ke madhyam se sampann hota tha
 The family is no longer a unit of production in these industrial societies
 bacchon ke shikshan kaa kaary shikshan sansthaaon ne liya he
 The kitchen work has gone to commercial eateries and refreshments
 manoranjan ke liye pruthak sanghathan sthapit ho gaye hai
 The responsibility of social security went to the state and due to the decreasing influence of religion, religious acts have been replaced by secondary
 pati or patni kaa adhikansh samay ghar ke baahar vyateet hota he
 Yet the family remains and carries out some important functions, which are called permanent or residual functions of the family
 janajatiyon main, jo saamaajik vikascram main aadim avasthaa ke adhik nikat hai, vivaah or parivaar ke praaia: sabhi prakaar milte hai
 From the point of view of development in these different types, it is not possible to determine the preorder
 kand mul or shikaar par basar karanevaale andamani aadimvasiyon main ekapatnitv kaa niyam he or ve pitruvansheey tathaa pitristhaneey hai
 The farming Hopi clan of North America has a practice of monogamy or monogamy but is matrilineal and maternal
 adhikansh janajaatiyon main parivaar kaa sanyukt rup he, kintu jahaan pati patni alag ghar main rahete hai, ve bhi ek brihattar parivaar ke ang hote hai or yah parivaar sammilit sampatti, aarthik kriyaaon, dharmik krityon tathaa anek pariwarik adhikaron evam kartavyon aadi se grathit ek pruthak ikai hota he
 Of the two genealogies, a tribe is either ancestral or matrilineal
 jo kabeeley matruvansheey hai ve praaia: matrusthaneey bhi hai, jahaan pati parivaar kaa sthaayee yaa asthaayee sadsy hota he
 In the Garo clan, it is only the visitor who is an overnight guest
 kintu matruvansheey or matrusthaneey kabeeley bahut kam hai
 The polyandry clan is even less
 pitruvansheey kabeelon main hi bahupati pratha pai gai he or inamen nari kaa varja purush kii apeksha hin he
 In the patriarchal tribes, men are often allowed to have more than one wife, but there is very little that only specific and powerful people can do
 aisi avasthaa main patniyaan ek ghar main bhi rahati hai or paas paas bane alag alag gharon main bhi
 Youth marriage in its pure form is not found in any clan
 jonsaar babar main bhratuk bahupati pratha he
 There, siblings sometimes keep more than one wives and they all have collective wives, who are part of a family and family
 matruvansheey or matrusthaneey kabeelon main bhi shaasha varg purush he, kintu nari ke adhikaron tathaa pratishtha kii drushti se pitruvansheey or pitristhaneey kabeelon kii apeksha inaki sthiti praaia: acchhee he
 In many ancestral tribes, the status of male and female is almost equal, however in most of the tribes, it is inferior to male
 kabeelon main vivahaviched or punarvivaah kaa niyam he or is sambandh se stri or purush ko praaia: samaan adhikaar hai
 In fact, most of the tribes are ancestral and the woman has to go to the family, family and colony of the man after marriage, where the husband has mother, father, brother and other blood relatives and friends
 vahaan use pati ke kutuban kaa ang hokar use bade logon ke anushaasan main rahanaa hota he or pati ke kulachaar kaa paalan karnaa hota he
 In the event of marriage, the woman has to take refuge in her parents
 matrusthaneey kabeelon main parivaar adhik sthaayee dikhaai padataa he
 This seems to be a natural group of blood relatives
 bahut kam kabeeley aise hai jahaan ladke yaa ladakiyon ko vivaah ke pehle brahmacharya paalan kaa niyam ho
 Some tribes have a pre-marriage trial period
 jonsaar babar ke khason main abhyaagton ke swaagat main parivaar kii avivaahit ladakiyon kaa sambhog ke liye prastut karne kii pratha he
 This makes it clear that the existence of the family is not for the male female lust, but is controlled by the family
 bharat mukhyat: krishipradhan desh he or yahan kii paariwarik rachana praaia: krishi kii aavashyaktaaon se prabhavit he
 In addition, the dignity and ideals of the Indian family are traditional
 kisi anya samaaz main grihasth jivan kii itani pavitrataa tathaa pita, putr bhai bhai or pati patni ke itane sthaayee sambandhon kaa udhaaharan nahin miltaa
 Although many distinctions are found in various fields, religions and castes in terms of the practice of secular rights, marriage and marriage, etc
, the ideal of joint family is well accepted
 sanyukt parivaar main sambandhiyon kaa dayera pati, patni tathaa unki avivaahit santanon se bhi adhik vyapak hota he
 Often, individuals of three generations and sometimes even more generations in the same discipline in a house and belonging to a kitchen consume the property involved and participate in the family's religious functions and rituals
 yadhyapi musalamaanon or isaayiyon main sampatti ke niyam bhinn hai, tathaapi sanyukt parivaar ke adarsh, paramparaayen or pratishtha ke kaaran in saanpattik adhikaron kaa vyaavhaarik paksh parivaar ke sanyukt rup ke anukool hi rahata he
 The joint family has its origins in ancient traditions and ideals in addition to India's agrarian economy
 ramayana or mahabharat kii gaathaon dwaara yah adarsh jan jan tak pahonchte hai
 Agriculture has provided the stability of family life everywhere
 at: bhartiya samaaj main parampara se utpaadan kaary, upbhog or suraksha kii buniyadi ikai parivaar he
 Indian society, with exceptions, is patriarchal, patriarchal and patriarchal
 yahan purush kii apeksha nari kaa darja hin mana jaataa he
 Women have been considered to have very limited rights over property
 phir bhi, gruhasthi ke anek maamalon main uski mahatta sweekrut he
 Generally, a marriage is recognized
 kintu purush ko ekaadhik vivaah karne kaa adhikaar he
 According to the traditional ideal, widow marriage is prohibited, but a widower can marry
 pativrata dharm kii bahut mahima he
 Pitra Puja also has a heavy significance
 ucch jatiyon ko chhodkar anya sabhi jatiyon main praaia: vivaah viched or vidhwaa vivaah prachlit he
 But when a caste wants to elevate its dignity, it rejects both these practices
 ghar kaa sabase adhik vayovruddh purush, yadi vah kaarynivrutt na ho gaya ho to sanyukt parivaar kaa karta athwa mukhiya hota he
 Somewhere he is also called the owner
 yah karta anya vayovruddh yaa vayask sadasyon kii salaah se yaa uske bina hi parampara ke aadhaar par parivaar main kaaryavibhaajan, utpaadan, upbhog aadi kii vyavastha karata he or parivaar tathaa uske sadasyon se sambadhit saamaajik mahatv ke prashnon kaa nirnay karata he
 The eldest woman in the household is the head of the female section of the family and supervises and arranges the work assigned to the women
 bhojan taiyaar karnaa bacchon kaa paalan poshan karnaa tathaa katai aadi mahilaon ke mukhya kaam hai
 As such, they also help in some minor tasks of farming or business
 sanyukt parivaar main chachaa, taaoo kii vivaahit santan or uske vivaahit putr, pautra aadi bhi ho sakate hai
 Generally, in the life of a father, his son does not separate from the family and settle in an independent family, but this is not an impenetrable tradition
 aisa samay aata he jab raktasambandhon kii nikatataa ke aadhaar par ek sanyukt parivaar do yaa anek sanyukt athwa asamyukt pariwaron main vibhakt ho jaataa he
 The disjoint family also takes a combined form in the chronology and the order of the joint family remains
 sanyukt parivarpranali yadhyapi bahut pracheen he, tathaapi iske aantarik swaroop main bahirvivaah, uttaradhikaar tathaa saanpattik adhikaar ke niyamon main, kalkram main parivartan hota rahaa he
 The Industrial Revolution has disrupted the traditional joint family in Western countries, due to which the livelihood security and advancement facilities are given to the person outside the family as a result of increased mechanization
 bharat main bhi audyogic kranti ke falswaroop nai arthvyavastha or nae audyogic tathaa aarthik sanghathanon kaa aarambh ho chukaa he
 New means of transport and communication are becoming available and urbanization is taking place at a rapid pace
 paashchaatya vichaardhaara or paashchaatya dhang kii shiksha diksha tathaa aadarshon kaa prabhaav bhi kam nahin he
 Laws have been enacted especially in relation to marriage, succession, adoption and secular rights after independence
 They are considered harmful to the joint system of the family
 isi prakaar iskar ke niyam bhi iske pratikul padate hai
 Adult suffrage political democracies are also attacking the unitary and individual existence of the joint family
 aisi avasthaa main jab arthvyavastha or utpaadan ke sadhano main bhi buniyadi parivartan ho rahaa he, parivaar ke shashan, rachana or kaaryon main herpher hona avashyambhavi he or vah parilakshith bhi ho rahaa he
 But it is difficult to say that the joint form of the family is ending
 nagaron or graamon main sanyukt parivaar pehle se kam ho gaye hai, iskaa koi pramaan nahin he
 There are mainly two types of ideas among scholars regarding change
 ek vichaar ke anusaar paristhiti ke prabhavaswaroop parivaar main katipay parivartan hone par bhi uskaa sanyukt rup nasht nahin ho rahaa he
 According to the second view, industrial civilization will present a joint family in India as much as the same couple family which has emerged in America and Europe
 vartmaan paariwarik vighatan env parivartanon ko is prakram kii aarambhik avasthaa bataaya jaataa he
 The Nair and Tiya castes in the Malawar region of India have been home to maternal local and maternal families till recently
 aise pariwaron main pati apane bacchon ke ghar main ek asthaayee aagatuk hota he
 Her maternal uncle is looked after by her children and her children assume their mother's family name
 parivaar kaa rup sanyukt he, jisamen maan kii or uski putree athwa pautriyon kii santan hoti he
 In these families the head of the household is the matriarchal male

 In the Jaunsar Babar tribe of Uttar Pradesh, there is a polyandry practice in the tribe of Khas and in some surrounding areas

 580px | thumb | Territorial disputes in Europe The wikt:antarctic Treaty System, formed on wikt:1 December wikt:1959 and entered into force on wikt:23 June wikt:1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of wikt:antarctica and provides administration for the continent, which is carried out through consultative member meetings
 It freezes the territorial claims of all signatories for as long as the treaty is in force
 However, it is not a final settlement; parties can choose to withdraw from the System at any time
 Furthermore, only a minority of states have signed it, and it is not formally sanctioned by the wikt:united Nations
 Thus, Antarctica remains the only part of the planet any state can still lay claim to as wikt:terra nullius 
 When the wikt: Constitution of the Republic of China was adopted on wikt: 25 December wikt: 1947, the wikt: Republic of China did recognize the statehood of the wikt: Mongolian People's Republic with Soviet pressure
 After the wikt: UN General Assembly Resolution 505 was passed in 1952, the Republic of China withdrew such a recognition in 1953 and therefore claimed wikt: Greater Mongolia including wikt: Outer Mongolia
 On wikt:26 November wikt:1993, the wikt:judicial Yuan of the Republic of China in its Interpretation 328 called the constitutional territory beyond the reach of judicial review and thus avoided the question as whether Mongolia should be considered the constitutional territory of the Republic of China
 The Republic of China has once again recognized the statehood of wikt: Mongolia in 2002, thus freezing the territorial claim, but as the Constitution of the Republic of China still mentions Mongolia in Article 119 that has not been superseded by the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China, there are different opinions as to whether such a recognition is constitutional
 Despite these, the Yearbook of the Republic of China 2003 Version published by the wikt: Government Information Office does claim Outer Mongolia
 thumb|map of the Republic of China with various territorial disputes Over 1
5% of the world's population live in an area disputed by two countries that are members of the wikt: United Nations
 This rises to around 25% when the areas and regions where territorial claims are made by two or more parties that do not recognize each other is included, although much of this comes from the wikt: Republic of China's claim to wikt: mainland China

 There is a huge period in the history of pre-cambrian or pre-cambrian Earth that precedes the present visible Mahakal
 iskaa vistaar lagbhag 4600 million varsh purv jab dharti kaa nirmaan hua tha se lekar cambrian kaal, tak he
 pre-cambrian geology has a very important place in stratigraphy, because two-thirds of Earth's history is contained in this kalpa
 is kalp ke sabase pracheen shail kareeb 250 karod varsh puraane hai
 Subsequent geological revolutions, under which the history of many volcanic mountains and metamorphism have been hidden, have brought so much change in the rocks of this era that identifying their true form is now a complex problem
 iske atirikt ye shilaayein itani kawantarit, valit tathaa bhranshit ho chuki hai ki inkaa kaaltatv vibhaajan evam samatulyata atyant dushkar hai
 Ordinary rules of stratigraphy are not applicable in this regard
 yahi kaaran he ki abhi bhi purv cambrian shailasamoohon kaa thik thik vargeekaran nahin ho paaya he
 The pre-cambrian period is divided into two main epochs: one, which consists of the most ancient rock formations of the earth's surface, and the other, containing deposited rocks shortly before Cambrian

1 f Ethanol is a well-known alcohol
 ise ethil alcohol bhi kehete hai
 There are two different methods of preparing it: sanshleshan vidhi-ethilin gas ko sandra salfurik amla main shoshit karaane se ethil hydrogen salphet banataa he jo jal ke saath ubaalane par uddhighatit hokar ethil alcohol detaa he
 The prevalence of this method is not yet high
 kinvikaran vidhi- iske dwaara kisi bhi shakkarmay padaarth yaa starchamay padaarth se alcohol vyapaarik maatra main banaate hai
 This reaction can be broadly written as follows: saadhaarant: alcohol shire se, jo shakkar or chukundar ke milon main vyarth bachaa padaarth he, banaaya jaataa he
 About 30 to 35 percent sugarcane sugar in molasses and about the same glucose and fructose is dissolved
 shore main itnaa hi jal milaayaa jaataa he jitne se uskaa aapekshik ghanatv 1
03 se lekar 1
04 tak ho jaataa he
 To prevent the growth of bacteria and other unnecessary ferments, a few drops of sulfuric acid are added to this solution
 ab isamen thodaa sa yeast daalkar ise 30°-40° centegrade taap par rakh dete hai
 At about 40-50 hours, denaturing ceases
 is prakaar se shire kii lagbhag 95% shakkar vicchhinn hokar alcohol or carbon-daai-oxide main parivartit ho jaati he
 Starchy substances are first boiled in hot steam by cutting into small pieces or grinding with water
 starchamay padaarth lei kii tarah ho jaataa he; ise halava kehete hai
 Mix a little malt extract in the mash and keep it at 55 ° -60 ° c temperature
 malt nishkarsh main vidyaman diastess-enzim dwaara starch kaa udvighathan hokar maltose banataa he
 This process takes about half an hour and the fluid that is found in this way is called a decoction
 kwath ko ubalkar isamen vidyaman diastess ko nasht kar dete hai; ise 20° sein
 taap tak thanda kar isamen yeast daalate hai or phir ise 20°-37° sein
 ke bich rakh chhodte hai
 Maltase-enzymes present in yeast extract the maltose into glucose
 is glucose ko phir zimes-enzim dwaara vighatit kar alcohol praapt karte hai
 In this way it takes 3-4 days to make alkol
 kinvikaran ke baad jo drav miltaa he use dhovan kehete hai; isamen alcohol lagbhag 10-15% tak hota he; iskaa prabhajit aswan karne par jo drav miltaa he usamen lagbhag 95

 About 0
4 gallons of rectified spirit is obtained from this gallon of molasses
 is ractifid spirit main alcohol ke atirikt thodi maatra main aceteldihide, glisreen, saksinic amla or fuzel tel ashuddhi ke rup main rahete hai
 In order to separate these impurities, it is first filtered by charcoal and then by first distillation to obtain the first, second and last secretions containing acetaldehyde, rectified spirit and fusel oil respectively
 ractifid spirit se jalarahit vishuddh alcohol banane kii saadhaaran vidhi yah he ki isamen thodaa bari kaa chuunaa daal dete hai; ek do din ke baad alcohol ko nitharakar aswan paatr main rakhkar sodium yaa calcium ke taaze kate chote-chote thode se tukade daalkar ise turant asavith karte hai
 a tube filled with calcium chloride is placed in the vessel to prevent the water vapor from the customer

 Industrial expansion requires cheaper availability of industrial alcohols
 isliye usapar kar yaa to nahin lagata he yaa bahut kam
 People add some toxic and unhealthy substances to the tax-free alcohols in every country with the aim of making them drink it, so that it becomes necessary, but other functions are not inappropriate
 adhikansh deshen main ractifid spirit main 5 se 10 pratishat tak methil alcohol or 0
5% piridin mila dete hai or use methilated spirit kehete hai
 The name methylated spirit is due to methyl alcohol
 kintu aajkal bahut se vikrut alcohalon main methil alcohol bilkul nahin rahata

 Wear, wine, chappen, port, sherry and cider are some of the main exclusive wines; Wear is made from barley and all other grapes; The alcohol content in these ranges from 3 to 20 percent
 madiraa tathaa anya alkohliy dravon main alcohol kii maatra gyaat karne kii vidhi ko alcoholamiti kehete hai
 For this, a table is prepared in which the alcohol content of alcohols of different relative densities give percentage of alcohols at different temperatures
 agyaat alkohliy drav kaa aapekshik ghanatv hydrometer se tathaa taap tapamapi se gyaat kar talika kii sahaayta se us drav main upasthit alcohol kii pratishat maatra gyaat kar lee jaati he

 handal ne apni rachana main ricardo broshi dwaara rachit tathaa 1728 main rome main pradarshit opera l isola di alchina ke liberato kaa prayog kiya tha, jo unhen unke italy pravaas ke dauraan praapt hua tha
 The plot was initially taken from Ludovico Ariosto's work Orlando Furioso - an epic based on Charlemagne's war against Islam - but some modifications were made in terms of compatibility
 
 The plot of this opera is based on a poem called Orlando Furioso
 vir yoddha rugineero ki niyati main ek chota lekin gauravshaalee jivan likhaa he or isliye ek udaar jaadugar sadaa use uski mangetar bradamante se dur le jane kii koshish karata rahata he
 Bradamante does not sit silent and sets out in search of his fiancée
 opera ke prarambh se thik pehle hi vah rugineero ko ek jaadui kile se bachaati he, lekin kile se baahar aate hi uskaa udan-ghoda rugineero ko lekar ud jaataa he or samudr ke bich ek tapu par utarataa he
 As the flying horse starts eating a bush, Rujiyaro is stunned to hear that bush speak
 vah jhaadi use bataati he ki vah vastav main sar aastolfo naamak yoddha he jise us tapu kii swamini mayavini bahanon alchina or morgana ne apane jaadu ke jor se mehandi ke paudhe main badal diya he
 Alachina, a charming sorceress, lures all the men who reach her island and binds her in her love, but then soon gets bored with her lovers and transforms them from her illusion into stones, animals, trees or any other object of her choice
 She gives
 aastolfo kii chetavanee ke baavjood rugineero is mayavini se milane jaataa he - or uske jaadu main fas jaataa he
 Then, while searching for her lover, Bradamante arrives on the island of Alchina with Ruiziero's former teacher Meliso
 kavach dhaaran kar bradamante ek purush kii tarah dikhti he or apane hi bhai richiardo hone kaa abhinay karti he
 He and Meliso have a magic ring, using which they both plan to break Alchina's throne and free her captives
 tapu par unki mulaakaat sabase pehle jaaduugarani morgana se hoti he
 Morgana Rupwan, devoid of human emotion and understanding of true love, is fascinated by the sight of 'richiardo' and abandons her lover Oronte
 morgana naye aagantukon ko alchina ke darbar main le jaati he, jahaan bradamante yah dekhakar niraash ho jaati he ki rugineero puri tarah se alchina ke mohpash main bandh kar apane purv jivan ke bare main sab kuch bhul chukaa he
 At Alchina's court, he also meets Oberto, a child who is in search of his father, Astolfo, who was last seen visiting this island
 bradamante samaj jaati he ki aastolfo ko zarur alchina or morgana ne apni maaya se kisi pashu yaa vastu main badal diya hoga, lekin vah is vishay par chup rah kar rugineero ko bachaane par apana dhyaan kendrit karti he
 Brdamante and Meliso reprimand Rujiyaro for being so bold, but Rujiyaro is only immersed in Alachina's magic
 idhar oronte ko pataa chalata he ki morgana richiardo par aasakt ho gayi he or vah krodh main richiardo ko dwandvayuddh ki chunauti de baithta he
 Morgana stops the fight, but Oronte discharges his charge on Rujiyero
 vah use bataa detaa he ki alchina apane purv-premiyon kaa apni mayavi shakti se kya hashr karti he or kahata he ki uske vichaar main rugineero kaa bhi sheeghra hi aisa hi hashr hoga, kyonki use shaq he ki alchina rugineero se ub kar richiardo par mohit ho gai he
 Rujiyaro is shocked to hear this and gets angry and goes to Alchina
 sthiti tab or bhi bighad jaati he jab richiardo vahaan aakar alchina se prem karne kaa dhong karata he
 Alchina calms Rujiyaro, but Brdmante is overwhelmed by seeing Alchina in love with his fiancée, and reveals to Rujiero his true identity
 meliso ko bhay hota he ki rugineero yah bhed alchina ko bataa degaa or vah turant bradamante kii baat kaa khandan karata he
 On hearing such contradictory statements, Rujiyaro gets confused
 alchina morgana se kahati he ki rugineero ko yah dikhaane ke liye ki vah usase prem karti he or richiardo se nahin, vah richiardo ko kisi pashu main badal degi
 Morgana, enamored of Ricciardo, is horrified to hear this and tells Ricciardo to flee the island to save Alcina from Maya; But Ricciardo says that he will remain on the island because he loves someone else
 yah sunakar morgana yah maan kar khush ho jaati he ki richiardo usase prem karata he or is ank kaa samaapan morgana ke harshgaan tornami aa vaaneja ke saath hota he
 Meliso wears his magic ring to free Rujiyero from Alchina's spell
 anguthi ke prabhaav se ruziero tapu par faile alchina ke mayajaal se mukt ho jaataa he or tapu ko uske asli rup - daityon se bhare marusthal - main dekh paata he
 The pillaged Rujiyaro realizes that he has to leave Tapu in a hurry and sings the famous gesture Verdi Prati, in which he accepts that he will not forget Alachina and the seductive beauty of his island for a lifetime
 This beauty was only an elusive illusion
 meliso rugineero ko saavdhaan karata he ki alchina jaisi vikat jaaduugarani ke tapu se bahar nikalnaa aasaan nahin hoga or usase chal se kaam lene ke liye kahata he
 He suggests to Rujiyaro that he conceals his plan to leave his island by taking permission from Alchina to go on a hunt
 rugineero yah suzav maan letaa he, parantu vah ab tak alchina ke mayajaal se itnaa hataash ho chukaa hota he ki jab bradamante apane asli rup main uske saamne aati he to vah use bhi alchina dwaara rachit ek or marichika samaj kar use bradamante maanane se manaa kar detaa he
 Both Alchina and Bradamante are disappointed by Rujiero's neglect
 rugineero ko apane prem kaa pramaan dene ke liye alchina vahaan prakat ho kar richiardo ko pashu-rup main badal dene ke liye udyat ho jaati he
 Seeing Ricciardo in this grave crisis, Rujiero quickly controls his emotions and convinces Alchina that he needs no proof of Alchina's love
 is bindu par darshakon ko pataa chalata he ki alchina vastav main rugineero se prem karti he
 Here Oronte suspects that Ricciardo, Meliso and Ruggiero are making plans together and Morgana and Alchina also realize that they are being tricked
 par ab tak bahut der ho chuki hoti he : alchina kii shakti kaa strot chal or bhranti he or uske jivan main sachche prem ke aate hi uski maaya kamazor hone lagati he
 At the end of this issue, Alchina tries to stop Rujiyaro by invoking the demons, but her elusive powers become fruitless due to her true love for Rujiyero
 morgana fir se oronte se apana sambandh jodne kii ichha se uske paas jaati he
 Oronte rebuffs him; But as Morgana goes away, he admits that he still loves Morgana
 rugineero phir se apana yoddhochit swabhimaan praapt karata he or ucch shringon ke saath ek bhav-geet gaata he
 Alchina joins Oberto with a lion and orders him to kill the lion
 oberto us singh se ek vicitra sambandh kaa anubhav karata he or alchina kii ajna maanane se inkaar kar detaa he
 He understands that this lion is definitely his father, whom Alchina has transformed from his illusion into an animal
 bradamante or rugineero alchina or morgana kii maaya ke strot, jiskaa nirupan yahan par ek kalash ke rup main kiya gaya he, ko nasht karne kaa nirnay karte hai
 Alchina begs them not to do so, but Rujiyaro despises her requests and destroys the maya-kalash
 uske aisa karte hi aksmaat chaaron ore vinaash or punarniman ek saath hi prarambh ho jate hai
 The maya-mahal of Alchina collapses and the Mayawini sisters Alchina and Morgana merge into the earth
 unke jaadu ke jor se rupantarit unke anekon puraane premi apane asli rup main laut aate hai: alchina dwaara oberto ko dikhaaya gaya singh uske pita aastolfo main badal jaataa he
 Alchina and several other men left from the illusion of Morgana describe the elusive torture given to them by those enchanted sisters: both of them had turned their magic into rock, some into a tree, and some into a sea wave
 sabhi manushya alchina or morgana ko bhula kar apni mukti or prasannataa kaa utsav manaate hai

 vyaktitv ek sthir avasthaa na hokar ek gatyaatmak samshti he jis par parivesh kaa prabhaav padataa he or isi kaaran se usamen badlaav aa saktaa he
 a person's personality is reflected in the behavior, thoughts, actions and activities of the person
 vyakti kaa samast vyavhaar uske vaataavaran yaa parivesh main samaayojan karne ke liye hota he
 Personality refers to a person's outward appearance in public, but in psychology, personality refers to a combination of the person's qualities, that is, both the qualities and the inner elements of a person's outer covering
 manovaigyanikon, darshanikon evam samaaj-shastriyon ne vyakti ke vibhinn pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vibhinn paribhaashaayen di hai
 In this way, hundreds of definitions of personality have been given
 suvidha kii drushti se gilford ne in paribhaashaon ko chaar virgon main baant diya he jo nimnlikhit hai- Keeping the above sections in mind, the definitions of personality can be given as follows- is varg main ve paribhaashaayen aati ho jo vyakti kii samast anukriyaaon, pratikriyaaon tathaa jaivik gunon ke samucchy par dhyaan detii he
 Definitions of camph and marten prince are important in this
 kemff ke anusaar According to Marten Prince, ke anusaar, The definitions of this class emphasize the sum of different forms, qualities and elements of personality
 in gunon ke samakalan se vyakti main ek visheshta utpann ho jaati he
 Among the definitions of this class are the definitions of Warren and Carmichael and mccardy
 warren tathaa karmical ke anusaar, In the words of mccurdy, willian jaimus tathaa mislo jaise kuch manovaigyanikon ne vyaktitv ke kai sopan bataae hai
 These psychologists have mainly considered four steps of personality - pratham sopan ke antargat vyakti ke sharir kii banaavat main anuvaanshikta se praapt vishesh gun sammilit he jabaki dwitiya sopan main saamaajik sambandhon or saamaajik vikaas kaa ullekh hota he
 The third step of personality is considered by Jams to be a spiritual personality
 unke anusaar is sopan vaale vyakti kii ruchi aadhyatmik vishyon main hoti he or saamaajik vah sambandhon kii apeksha ise adhik mahatv detaa he
 Now his spiritual personality starts developing
 chauthe sopan main vyakti apane aatm swaroop kaa purna gyaan kar letaa he or sabhi vastuon main apni aatma kaa darshan karata he or tab vah apane vyaktitv ke antim sopan par pahunchataa he
 Shri Aurobindo has also revealed almost similar ideas in the course of development
 unhone bhautik, bhavatmak yaa pranic, bauddhik, chaityas, aadhyatmik tathaa ati maansik sopanon kaa ullekh kiya he
 In the definitions of this class, psychologists consider the study of personality of the individual and the adjustment in the interpretation important
 is varg main ve paribhaashaayen aati ho jinamein samaayojan par sabase adhik bal diya jaataa he
 The qualities in the person that help him to adjust, whether they are physical or mental are all formed in such a way that they are constantly moving
 in gunon kii gatyaatmakataa ke kaaran hi ek vishesh prakaar kii ananyta yaa apurvata vyakti main paidaa ho jaati he
 According to boring, vyakti ke vyaktitv ko sampoorn rup se paribhaashit karne main uparokt paribhaashaayen aanshik hai
 No matter how many mental or physical qualities a person may have, how anxious or knowledgeable it is, but his behavior and adjustment remain incomplete when there is no mobility in his behavior
 alport ne is baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar apane vichaaron ko vyakt karke vyaktitv kii paribhaasha ko sarvamaanya banane kaa purna evam safal prayaas kiya
 His definitions have been accepted by most psychologists as absolute definitions
 atah is varg kii paribhaashaon main alport kii paribhaasha mahatvapurn he
 According to Alport, vyaktitv ko prabhavit karne main kuch vishesh tatwon kaa haath rahata he unhen ham 'vyaktitv ke nirdharak' kehete hai
 These elements together help in making the personality complete
 inhen tatwon ke anuroop vyaktitv kaa vikaas hota he
 Some scholars have considered biological basis to be important in the determination of personality, while some have given importance to the environmental basis, but both these determinants have a role in the development of personality
 jaivik nirdharak nimna chaar hai:- The three determinants of environment are - vyaktitv main kuch gun paitruk yaa anuvaanshik hote hai
 Body color, shape, body texture can be rich in qualities
 iskaa kaaran balak ko praapt hue apane mata-pita ke gunasutra hai
 The child's heredity is not only contributed by his parents
 balak kii anuvaanshikta kaa aadha bhaag mata-pita se, ek chauthai bhaag dada-daadi se, naanaa-nani se va aathvaan bhaag pardada-daadi or anya purakhon se praapt hota he
 Therefore, the personality of the child has the influence of ancestral qualities
 uskaa rang-rup yaa shaareerik gathan ke gun uske mata yaa pita se yaa uske dada yaa daadi ke gunon ke anuroop ho sakate hai
 In the same way, the qualities of intellect and mental abilities can be in line with those of his ancestors
 kai adhyayanon main yah dekha gaya he ki purvajon kii maansik vyaadhiyon ke gun unki peedi ke kisi bhi vyakti main prakat ho sakate hai
 In this way we see that paternal qualities have more or less influence on the personality formation of a person
 shaareerik gathan ke antargat vyakti kii lambaai, banaavat, varna, bal, ankhen va naak nakshaa aadi angon kii gananaa hoti he
 These physical characteristics are so obvious that many people understand the person with them
 haalanki yah drushtikon thik nahin he phir bhi ye visheshtaayen vyaktitv kii dyotak avashya hai
 People are impressed by seeing a strong and beautiful person from the body
 ve uske sharir ke gathan kii prashansa karte hai
 This has the effect of appreciation on the mental aspect of that person, that he feels better than others and instills confidence and self-esteem in him
 shaareerik gathan thik na hone or shaareerik angaheenata rahane par vyakti main hin bhaavana paidaa ho jaati he
 He considers himself gone and inferior and may lack confidence, he is always apprehensive in the success of his work and may adopt antisocial behavior to compensate for the lack
 vyaktitv vikaas par swasthya kaa bhi asar padataa he
 a person who remains physically healthy leads a good social life and sociality develops in him
 swasth vyakti apane kaary ko safalataa se samay par puraa karke apane uddeshy kii prapti kar letaa he
 On the contrary, the personality of an unhealthy person remains incomplete
 aswasthta ke kaaran apane kaaryon ko samay par puraa nahin kar paata jisase vah apane lakshya kii prapti samay par nahin kar paata
 The interest to work in it is also less
 aswasth vyakti dusron ko prabhavit bhi nahin kar saktaa
 In this way, physical formation and health have a significant impact on personality
 vyaktitav ke vikaas main antamasravi grathiyon kaa atyadhik prabhaav padataa he
 They are found in every human body
 in grathiyon ko 'nalikavihin granthiyaan' bhi kehete hai
 They send secretions into the body without ducts
 inke srav nyasar yaa hormones kehalaate hai
 Different glands secrete one or more hormones
 mukhya rup se ye granthiyaan 8 hoti hai
 These are antamasravi grathiyon evam sharir rachana ke atirikt vyaktitv ke jaivik karkon main shaareerik rasayan kaa ullekh bhi aavashyak he
 Since ancient times, the reason of human nature has also been considered to be the elements of his body chemistry
 isa se lagbhag 400 varsh purv yunaan ke prasiddh chikitsak va vichaarak hipocraties ne sharir main payejane vaale rasayanon ke aadhaar par vyakti ke swabhaav kaa nirupan kiya he
 Almost this type has also been described in Ayurveda
 ye shaareerik rasayan chaar prakaar ke hote hai
 Excess of blood makes a person habitually optimistic and enthusiastic
 pitt kii adhikta vaale vyakti chidchide yaa kopshil prakruti ke hote hai
 People who have predominance of phlegm or mucus are quiet and lazy
 aise vyakti ko shleshmik prakruti kaa kehete hai
 The person who has predominance of spleen substance or black bile
 aise vyakti udhaas rahane vaale hote ho inhen ke aadhaar par hippocraties ne vyaktitv ke prakaaron kaa varnan kiya he
 In addition to the above biological factors, there are some other biological factors that affect personality, these factors are - intelligence, color and gender
 manushya prakritik paryaavaran main rahata he uske jivan tathaa vyaktitv par bhugolic paristhitiyon evam jalwaayu kaa prabhaav padataa he
 Geographical conditions and climate have an impact on his health, body design and mental conditions
 jaise thandi jalwaayu main rahane vaale vyaktiyon kaa rang gora hota he jabaki garm jalwaayu main rahane vaale vyakti saanwale rang ke hote hai
 Geographical conditions also affect physical formation such as the physical formation of hill people
 jin jagahon par bhucamp yaa prakritik aapadaaen zyada hoti ho vahaan ke logon main suraksha kii bhaavana kam hoti he
 If a person's geographical conditions or climate is changed then his personality also changes
 jaise ooshna pradesh main rahane vaale logon ko sheet pradesh main rakhaa jaae to unke kaary karne kii kshamtaayen ghat sakati hai or swasthya par bura asar pad saktaa he
 Similarly, if the people living in cold state are kept in warm state, then the same effect will be on them
 vyakti saamaajik praani he or samaaj kii ikai bhi
 From birth till death he lives in the society
 atah samaaj kaa, samaaj kii sanrachana kaa or samaaj ke logon kaa us par bahut prabhaav padataa he
 How do people from family to society influence the personality of a person mata-pita ke prem ke abhaav kaa sabhi baalkon par ek sa prabhaav padataa he kyonki isamen balak ke janmajaat swabhaav or pravritiyon kaa bada mahatv he
 By disregarding and chastising the love of parents, one child can become submissive but the other child can become domineering and defiant
 alport ke anusaar ‘‘vahiin aag jo makkhan ko pighalaati he ande ko kathor banaati he
 "parental rebuke and adoption of a child also affects his personality
 yadi parivaar ke sadasyon main aapraadhik pravritiyaan ho to uskaa prabhaav bhi balak ke vyaktitv ke vikaas par padataa haior balak main bhi aapraadhik pravritiyaan janm leti ho or aage chalakar vah balak saamaajik aparaadh karne lagata he
 Similarly, the fractal family is also the main cause of juvenile crime
 pramaan nahin ho ki bachapan kii yah style aaajeevan aparivartit rahati he
 The personality development of a child has a lot of influence on the school, school studies, school teachers, child classmates and the geographical location of the school
 paddhashiksha kaa prabhaav - vidhyalay main shiksha kis prakaar kii di jaati he iskaa prabhaav balak ke vyaktitv par padataa he
 In many schools, religiosity, fundamentalism is taught, this leads to the development of the personality of the child towards a certain religion and a certain religion
 isse balak duusare dharmon ke prati irshyaa or dwesh karne vaala ban jaataa he
 In many English-language schools, the child is not allowed to speak the mother tongue or other languages, but only the English language is compelled to speak, in such a situation, there is increased mental pressure on the child and frustration and frustration arise in him
 Later, the personality development and adjustment of the child is hindered
 kai vidyalayon main santulit shiksha nahin di jaati
 This is the biggest flaw in today's education system
 balak ke maansik or shaareerik vikaas par samuchit dhyaan nahin diya jaataa balki uske paathyakram kii kitni zyada pustaken badhaai jaye is par dhyaan diya jaataa he
 The burden of the child's bag, the hitting of the housework becomes a hindrance in the all round development of the child
 or uske santulit vyaktitv vikaas, sarvangin vikaas or mulyon ke vikaas ke liye vidhyalay main santulit evam naitik shiksha di jaani chahie
 Experimental based education, value-based education, numerous religious education and physical development education are also very helpful in the development of the personality of the child
 shikshakon kaa prabhaav - jis prakaar balak parivaar main mata yaa pita se tadatmya kar letaa he usee prakaar vidhyalay main bhi shikshakon se tadatmya kar letaa he
 If the personality of the teacher is effective then it has a favorable effect on the personality development of the child
 kai baar balak shikshakon ke nakaaratmak gunon ko sikh jaataa he
 It is fatal for teachers to get bidis, cigarettes from children and use them in their presence because the child learns to smoke beedis, cigarettes
 yadi shikshakon main achche gun ho to balak bhi un gunon kaa tadatmya kar letaa he, falswaroop balak ke vyaktitv vikaas main ve gun jud jate hai
 In short, all the qualities and demerits of the personality of the teacher, which usually appear in behavior towards the child, have a good or bad effect on the child's personality development
 sahpaathiyon kaa prabhaav - balak ke vyaktitv vikaas par uske sahpaathiyon yaa vidhyalay ke saathiyon kaa bahut bada prabhaav padataa he
 In school, he has to be with all kinds of peers
 kai sahpaathee aayu main usase bhinn hote ho, kai sneh karne vaale to kai nirdayee vidhyaarthee bhi uske saath hote hai
 With all these companions the child spends his school routine
 choti aayu yaa choti kaksha kaa vidhyaarthee bade vidhyaarthee se dabta he
 This suppression can be an ideal indicator as well as a fear indicator
 atah in karkon kaa prabhaav balak ke vyaktitv par padataa he
 Many times, the child learns the behavior of abusive children, including abusive, fleeing school, abusive behavior with teachers and parents, which affects his personality development
 sahpaathiyon kaa balak ke vyaktitv par sabase adhik prabhaav khel-krida samooh ke prabhaav ke rup main padataa he
 Students playing or competing together in the school, the culture environment in which their child develops, food, living, customs, religion, tradition, marriage, social ceremonies and social Institutions etc
 have an effect
 janajatiyon kii samskruti main bhi baari bhinnataayen hai
 For example, Nagas are hunters of the ends and Bhils are fighters and Santhals are straightforward
 is tarah saanskrithik parivesh main saamaajik rachana, saamaajik sthitiyaan, saamaajik kaary tathaa niyam samhitaayen manushya ke vyaktitv ko prabhavit karte hai
 At some places, students form teams and elect the leader to lead the party
 is tarah vibhinn kriyaaon kaa sanchaalan karne ke liye chaatr dal alag-alag dhang se kaary karata he jo uske vyaktitv vikaas main sahaayak he
 By having competition and competition with his peers, the child works hard which helps in his personality development
 vidhyalay kii bhugolic sthiti - vidhyalay kii bhugolic sthiti kisi he, iskaa prabhaav bhi balak ke vyaktitv ke vikaas par padataa he
 Where the school is located and what is the condition of the school building also affects the personality development of the child
 yadi vidhyalay pradooshan janit jagah par sthit he, jahaan vaayu pradooshan tathaa dhwani pradooshan ho to aise vidhyalay main adhyayan karne vaale baalkon ke swasthya par bura asar pad saktaa he
 If the school is located in a locality where the society like kanaka, drunkards, gamblers, prostitutes and thieves, the personality development of students studying in such area schools will be affected
 isamen balak samaaj virdohi vyavhaar sikh saktaa he
 If the school building is not clean and is in a dilapidated and dilapidated state then the development of the personality of the children studying at that place has a bad effect
 unke man main har samay bhawan ke dhah jane kaa bhay rahata he tathaa unamem anya vyaadhiyaan bhi utpann ho sakati ho jo unke vyaktitv vikaas main baadhak hote hai
 As has been written earlier, a person is a part and unit of society
 atah samaaj kaa vyaktitv vikaas par prabhaav padana swaabhaavik he
 Traditions customs, social rules of society have a wide impact on the development of the personality of an individual

 According to caste, varna and occupation, each person's situation in society is different
 parivaar kii saamaajiksthiti se baalkon ke vyaktitv par bhi prabhaav padataa he
 The social conditions of different castes, such as Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras and castes, are different
 kuch log jati-pratha, pardaa-pratha, bal vivaah ke pakshdhar hote ho to kuch ghor virdohi
 Some people appear to be ready to break every rule of society while some people are seen to follow them harshly
 oonchi jati ke baalkon main badppan kii bhaavana or nichi jatiyon main hinata kii bhaavana dekhi ja sakati he
 The personality of the children of upper houses seems restrained but there is no strong psychological evidence for this
 balak ke vyaktitv ke vikaas par samaaj sudhaarkon, saamaajik kaaryakrttaaon tathaa samaaj virdohi vyaktiyon kaa bhi prabhaav padataa he
 Social reformers, social workers and social workers work for the welfare of the society and the upliftment of the society and their impact on the personality development of the children
 isi tarah samaaj virdohi kaary karne vaale or saamaajik contakon kaa bhi prabhaav vyaktitv vikaas par padataa he
 People who are anti-social, do anti-social work such as picketing, stealing, alcoholism, prostitution etc
 and their effect on the personality development of the children
 samaaj-sevak samaaj ke vibhinn logon jaise vruddh, niraashrith, garib kii seva karte ho or samaaj kii surachana karne kaa praytn karte hai
 Their philanthropic service feelings also have an impact on the personality development of other individuals

 Culture and personality complement each other
 aaj ke adhiktar manovaigyanikonka yah vichaar he ki samskruti or vyaktitv do bhinn vasteen nahin hai, balki ek hi vastu ke do pahalu hai
 In the culture in which the child is brought up, the qualities of the same culture come into his personality
 maikivar or pej ke shabdon main ‘‘samskruti hamaare rahane va sochane ke dhangon main, dainik kaaryakalapon main, kala main, sahitya main, dharm main, manoranjan or sukhopbhog main hamaari prakruti kii abhivyakti he
 "culture is thus an area of working styles, values, emotional attachments and intellectual drive
" ek samskruti duusari samskruti se inhen gunon ke aadhaar par bhinn hoti he
 Different cultures have different values
 jaise-pracheen kaal main bhartiya log dharmaparayan or aadhyatmik the
 Modern Indians are not as spiritual and religious
 phir bhi unamem aadhyatmik evam dharmik mulya ucch str ke hai

 Similarly, differences in living, customs, religion, arts, values and traditions can be seen in societies of different cultures

 lagbhag 20 varshon ke saahitiyik jivan main shakespeare kii sarjanaatmak pratibha nirantar viksit hoti gai
 In general, four different stages are seen in this development
 praarambhik avasthaa 1595 main samaapt hui
 Almost all the works of this period are experimental
 shakespeare abhi tak apana maarg nishchit nahin kar paae the, atev vibhinn prachlit rachanapranaliyon ko kram se karyanvit karke apana rachanavidhan susthir kar rahe the, pracheen sukhaant naatakon kii prahasanatmak style main unhone 'di kamedi ov erars' or 'di teming of di su' kii rachana kii
 Subsequently, in 'love's Labors Lost', he followed the pattern of Lily's courtly pleasures
 isamen rajdurbar kaa vaataavaran upasthit kiya gaya he jo chatur paatro ke rochak vaartalap se paripurna he
 'the Two Gentlemen of Verona' imitates Greene's romanticistic pleasantries
 du:khant naatak bhi anukaranaatmak hai
 In 'richard III' the goods are imitated and in 'titus Andronicus' the Kid is followed but in 'romeo and Juliet' the element of origin is relatively high
 isi kaal main likhi hui donon prasiddh kavitaayen 'di rape aav lukris' or 'venus and adonis' par tatkaaleen italian premakavy kii chhap he
 The second phase of development ended in 1600
 isamen shakespeare ne anek praudh rachanaayen sansar ko bhent kin
 Now he had set his path and gained confidence
 'e mid samar nits dream' tathaa 'di marchent aav venice' rochak evam lokapriy sukhaant naatak hai kintu inase bhi adhik mahatv rakhanevaale shakeyapear ke sarvotkrisht sukhaant naatak 'much ado ebout nathing', 'aij you like it' tathaa 'twailvath nite' isi kaal main likhe gaye
 In these plays, the imagination of the poet and the pleasure of his mind are well published
 sarvottam aitihaasik naatak bhi isi samay likhe gaye
 Marlowe-influenced 'richard II' is far more successful in composition than the previous category of the same category, 'richard III'
 'henry chaturth' ke donon bhaag or 'henry pancham' jo suvikhyath aitihaasik naatak hai, isi kaal kii rachanaayen hai
 Almost all of Shakespeare's sonnets, which are unique for their excellent expression, were written between 1595 and 1607
 teesri avasthaa, jiskaa ant lagbhag 1607 main hua, shakespeare ke jivan main vishesh mahatv rakhti he
 The poet's mind was distressed over the years due to family misfortune and health problems
 at: in dinon kii adhikansh rachanaayen du:khant hai
 The worldly sorrow drama Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, and the Roman sorrow drama Julius Caesar, 'antoine and Cleopatra' and 'coriolanus' were written and played during this period
 'travaylas and cracida', 'als wel dait ands wel' or 'major for major' main sukh or du:kha kii sanshlisht abhivyakti hui he, tab bhi du:khad ansh kaa hi praadhanya he
 In the final stages of development, Shakespeare created Perrickles, Sinvelin, 'the Winters Tale', 'the Tempest' Prabhriti plays, which, despite being peaceful, filled with sad possibilities and created an evening atmosphere
 in sukhaant du:khant naatakon ko romance athwa shakespeare ke antim naatakon kii sangya di jaati he
 Shakespeare's pleasant plays have their own personal characteristics
 yadhyapi 'di kamedi aav erars' main platus kaa anusaran kiya gaya he tathaapi anya sukhaant naatak pracheen clasiki naatakon se sarvatha bhinn hai
 Their purpose is not to eradicate the deformities and improve the errors by the skit, but to entertain people through interesting story and characterization

 Shakespeare was introduced to certain upper-class families and the kind of life he saw in them is published in these plays

 The aristocratic protagonists of these plays become victims of torture and destruction after being on the road to success and progress for some time
 unke du:kha or mrityu ke kya kaaran hai, is vishay par shakespeare kaa mat spasht rup se abhivyakt hua he
 The misfortune of the protagonist is partly derived from unfavorable destiny and circumstances, but a much bigger reason is found in his character weakness
 pracheen unani dukhaant naatakon main nayak keval trutipurna nirnay athwa trutipurna drushtikon ke kaaran vinasht hota tha parantu, kadachit isai dharm or naitikwaad se prabhavit hokar, shakespeare ne apane naatakon main nayak ke patan kii pradhan jimmedaari uski charitrik durbalata par hi rakhi he
 Hamlet, Athelo, Lear and Macbeth - all of them find such a deficiency in their nature or character that causes their suffering and death
 in du:khant naatakon main duhara dwandv parilakshith hua he, aantarik dwandv ev bahya dwandv
 Internal conflict arises in the mind of the hero, in his thoughts and feelings and due to his intensity not only makes decisions difficult but also distracts the hero's principle for some time
 is prakaar ke aantarik dwandv ke kaaran naatakon main manovaigyanik sookshmata or rochakata kaa aavirbhaav hua he
 External conflict arises from the competition of external powers and their struggle, such as mutual opposition of two opposing political parties or armies
 shakespeare ke pramukh du:khant naatakon main raktagat evam bhayaavah drishyon kii avatarana ke kaaran atyant aatankapurna vaataavaran nirmit hua he
 Likewise, the incorporation of murder and vengeance scenes also deepened the process of depression
 in sabhi visheshtaon or upkarnon ko shakespeare ne katipay puraane naatakon tathaa seneka, kid, marlo aadi naatakakaron se grahan kiya tha or samayik lokaruchi ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi unka upyog apane naatakon main kiya tha
 The features of the grief dramas we have mentioned here are found not only in Hamlet, Athelo, King Lear, and Macbeth, but also partly in the grief plays based on Romeo and Juliet and the history of England and Rome
 Huh
 shakespeare ne jin aitihaasik naatakon kii rachana kii unamem kai roman itihaas vishyak hai
 In the writings of these Roman plays, Shakespeare has altered the facts of history quite a bit, and at some sites it appears that the portrait of life presented is not of ancient Rome but of Elizaveth England
 itnaa hone par bhi ye naatak sadaiv lokapriy rahe hai, visheshkar julius sijar tathaa antony and cleopatra
 Antoine Aid Cleopatra is full of poetic passages and the characterization of Cleopatra is extremely effective
 timen ov athens or pericules main unani itihaas kii ghatnaon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Among the plays based on English history, there are some that are written only partially by Shakespeare, but both Henry IV and Henry v are penned by Shakespeare
 in teenon naatakon main kavi ko mahan safalataa mili he
 They have a very attractive rendition of valor and honor and Falstaff's character is very interesting and charming
 richard tritiy or richard dwitiya main marlo kaa anukaran safaltaapurvak kiya gaya he
 Most English historical plays prior to Shakespeare contained inanimate depictions of facts and events, and they were monotonous due to blank history
 shakespeare ne is prakaar ke naatakon ko jeevant rup dekar chamatkaarpurn bana diya he
 The final plays have a mature biography of Shakespeare
