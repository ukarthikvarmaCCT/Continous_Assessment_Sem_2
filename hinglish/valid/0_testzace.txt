 or uske baad unhone kabhi pagadi athwa gandhi topi bhi nahin pahani thi, lekin bhartiya netaaon or satyagraiyon ne is topi ko aasaani se apana liya
 The Congress party added this cap to Gandhiji and encouraged his campaigners and volunteers to wear it
 is prakaar rajnatik kaarnon se hi sahi parantu is topi kii pahunch lakhon aise logon tak ho gai jo kisi bhi prakaar kii topi dhaaran nahin karte the
 Indian leaders and political parties used different forms of this type of cap
 subhash chandra bose khaaki rang kii to hindu mahasabha or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke kaaryakarta kaale rang kii topi pahante the
 The relevance of this cap still remains today

 It is difficult to create sections or sections of dictionaries in terms of subjects
 alag alag koshkar apni samaj ke anusaar is prakaar ke vishayvibhag banaaya karte the
 There was neither any fixed order nor could it happen
 isaliye logon ko praaia: sara kosh kanthsth karnaa padataa tha
 For this reason, dictionaries in Western countries started being made alphabetically
 aise kosh ratane nahin padate the or aavashyaktaanusaar jab jiskaa ji chahta tha, tab vah uskaa upyog kar saktaa tha
 Nowadays, in almost all countries and all languages, this sequence is being used in the field of thesaurus: which is the most important in terms of the curious
 isi liye kosh ke jitne prakaar hote hai, un sab main praaia: aksharkram kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are many types of thesaurus, but considering the meaning, they can be divided into two parts
 ek to ve jinamein kisi bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth or vivechan usee bhashaa main hote he or duusare ve jinamein ek bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth duusari bhashaa yaa bhashaaon me die jate hai
 There can be many types of thesaurus with the idea of subject, such as Mathematics dictionary, Legal dictionary, Medical dictionary etc
 aise koshon kii ginati praaia: shabdaawaliyon main hoti he, jaise krishi shabdaawalee, darshanik shabdaawalee, bhugolic shabdaawalee aadi
 Apart from these, some specific poets, dialects etc
 also have different lexicons, such as Tulsi Kosh, Sur Kosh, Awadhi Kosh, Brajbhasha Kosh, etc
 kisi vishisht vishay ke mahatvapurn granth main aae hue mukhya pratikon, vishyon yaa shabdon ke jo kosh yaa talikaay hoti he, unhen kramaat pratikanukramanika, vishayanukramanika yaa shabdanukramanika kehete hai
 Lexicography is an art
 is kala kaa gyaan vartmaan yug kii param unnat bhashaaon ke shabdkoshon kaa sookshm drushti se adhyayan karne par praapt ho saktaa he
 Editing of good and authentic thesaurus cannot be done only on the strength of scholarship, as long as the art of lexicography is also fully understood and the knowledge of this art can only come from the lifelong study of the lexicon
 sabhi prakaar ke kosh kisi vishesh uddeshy tathaa kisi vishesh kshetra kii aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye hi banaae jate hai
 Therefore, this purpose or need is mainly taken care of in the lexicon
 duusare, is baat kaa bhi baraabar dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki uskaa sara kalevar sabhi drushtiyon se santulit rahe; aisa na ho ki koi ang to aavashyaktaa yaa auchity se adhik bad jaae or koi uski tulana main kshinkaay yaa hin jaan pade
 The words should also be discussed and the order of the organs of that thought should always remain the same
 shabdon kii bhi jatiyaan yaa varg hote hai, at: ek jati yaa varg ke sab shabdon kaa sara vivechan ek sa hona chahie
 If examples of authentic texts or writers are taken, then they should be taken as much fraction as possible to clarify the intention and resolve the curious
 achche koshon main sabhi prakaar ke kshetron or vishyon ke paribhaashik shabd bhi rahete hai
 Therefore, the editor should have general knowledge or understanding of more and more subjects
 aavashyaktaa hone par kisi anjaane yaa nae vishay ke achche or pramanik granth se yaa uske achche gyaata se bhi sahaayta lenaa aavyashk hota he
 In the task of lexicography, the vision should be very wide and the instinct should be honeycomb
 drushti itani paini or sookshm honi chahie jo sahaj main nir ksheer kaa vivek kar saken or puraani trutiyon, dosha, bhuulon aadi ko dhundkar sahaj main unka sanshodhan tathaa sudhaar kar sake
 In the lexicon, there should also be no partiality or malicious name
 uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy hona chahie bhashaa tathaa sahitya kii seva
 In the lexicon, the primacy is only of meanings and thoughts, so there should not be any spread or overlap in them
 sabhi baaten nappi tuli, maryaadit or yathasadhay sankshipt honi chahie
 The maximum and concrete information in the dictionary should be presented in minimum words
 phaltu yaa bharti kii baton ke liye kosh main sthaan nahin hota
 Some forms of words are normative and many forms are spatial or provincial
 jin sthanik yaa prantiy shabdon ke maanak rup praapt hon, unka sara vivechan unheen maanak shabdon ke antargat rahanaa chahie or unke sthanik yaa prantiy roopon ke aage unke maanak roopon kaa abhidesh maatr hona chahie
 This has the great advantage that other linguists readily learn the standard form of the words and help the standard form of the language to be constant — that the form of the language is not deteriorated by the unfamiliar
 yahi baat aise sanskrit shabdon ke sambandh main bhi honi chahie jiske bahut se paryaay hon
 Like lotus, river, mountain, sea etc
 shabdon ke aage unke paryaay dete samay bhi is baat kaa dhyaan rahanaa chahie ki paryaay vahi die jaae jo mul shabd kaa thik aashay yaa maap bataanevaale hon
 It is advisable to abandon those environments in such contexts, due to which confusion may arise
 koshkaron ke saamne idhar haal main webster kii new world dictionari ne ek nayaa adarsh rakhaa he jo bahut hi upyogi tathaa upadey hone ke kaaran shabdkoshon ke liye vishesh anukaraniya he
 It also shows the subtle differences of similar resemblances to them under several words, such as - subtle differences of dread, frit, alarms, disme, terrer and panic are also mentioned under the fear
 aisa yah soch kaa kiya gaya he ki koshkar kaa kaam shabdon ke arth batala dene se hi samaapt nahin ho jaataa, varan isse bhi aage badhkar uskaa kaam logon ko shabdon ke thik prayog batalaana hota he
 We will find hundreds of thousands of such words, whose subtle differences can be revealed, and thus the curious can be made to think about the words in a new way
 haal ke achche or bade angareji koshon main ek or nai tathaa upyogi paripati chali he jo bhartiya bhashaaon ke koshon ke liye vishesh rup se upyogi ho sakati he
 In all languages, there are many compound words which are formed by prefixing
 kanishtha se akanishtha, karaniya se akaraniya, apekshit se anpekshit, aavashyak se anaavashyak, mantri se upamantri, samiti se upasmiti, paalan se paripaalan, bhraman se paribhraman, karm se pratikarm, vidhaan se pratividhan aadi
 The number of such words formed by the sum of prefixes is very large
 aise shabdon do virgon main bante hote hai athwa baante ja sakate hai
 For one, the words whose words are not combined with any new or specific meaning in the former verse and the answer word, which is why they live under ordinary words
 aise shabdon or unke arthon se kosh kaa kalevar bahut bad jaataa he
 To avoid this kind of meaningless expansion, this new method has been adopted in the new dictionaries of Webster that they are not considered as independent words and hence their meanings have not been taken
 prishth ke ant main ek rekha ke neeche aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de di gai he, yatha-an-dizyrd, an-disterbd, an-free, an-hart, an-invited aadi
 Yes, unlike these, there are certain words of other class in which some new meanings are derived from the addition of prefixes
 jaise visheshan rup main akach kaa rup bina balonvala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah ketu grah kaa bhi ek naam he
 Anagar means not only a householder, but in noun form he is also a signifier of a monk
 isaliye aise shabd lenaa aavashyak hota he
 The words whose meanings are automatically destroyed by the sum of predecessor and post-apocalyptic, it is considered futile to take meaning in the dictionary
 at: prishthant main aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de dena yathesht hoga
 Yes, the compound words in which a new and special meaning is derived from the sum of the two terms, it is necessary to take them in the same place as the meaning
 hamaare yahan ke puraane sanskrit koshon kii paddati yah rahi he ki ati, prati sah aadi ke yoga se bananevaale shabd apane purv padwale shabd ke antargat ek hi sheershak main ek saath de die jate he
 Some dictionaries of Hindi have also followed this practice
 yadhyapi sanskrit vyakaran kii drushti se yah paddati yuktisangat hoti he, phir bhi sanskrit koshon tak main inkaa puraa puraa paalan hota hua nahin dikhaai detaa
 There is some saving of space in this, but it becomes very difficult for exceptional readers to find the words
 kabhi kabhi to aise logon ke liye bhi is paddati se shabd dhoondhna kathin hota he jo iske niyamon or siddhanton se bahut kuch parichit hote hai
 In every language, there are some words which are also invariant, adverbs, adjectives, suffix nouns etc
 with the idea of different meanings and are also derived from different roots, ie Hindi is also a noun, adjective and suffix
 Too
 apane sangya rup main bhi vah apane kai arthon main kuch alag alag mulon se vyutpann he
 Such words are considered to be separate and independent words in modern and superior English lexicons and are treated with different titles, viz
 English also has a vise adjective, noun and suffix also and in three forms its titles are kept separately

 a torch or bearing is used to handle the parts of a rotating machine

 The simple torrent is similar to a tube in which the axle is inserted
 parantu tej chalanevaali dhuriyon ke liye, yaa jahaan gharshan ke kaaran dharuk tapakar kharaab ho saktaa ho, dharuk ke do paaton main banaaya jaataa he jo vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 The torrent of a machine is the part on which the load is kept at all times when the machine is running and due to rotation of the axle, the torrent keeps weeping something
 yadi dharuk ko thik prakaar se na banaaya jaae to bahut jald usko badalanaa padataa he
 Therefore, keeping all the things in mind, the Dharuk has to be made in such a way that at least the worn and worn parts can be replaced with convenience

 Other similar metals are also used in making this part

 It has been said above that either the torrent is made in one part like a tube, or it is made in two parts in such a way that the two parts become like a tube

 Putting the spindle in this vessel, the plate p 2 is applied over it and tightened by the tip of the cap
 topi t ke upree bhaag main ek chhed chha banaaya jaataa he, jisase tel yaa snehak diya jaataa he
 The grease or lubricant moves through the holes in the grooves inside the axle and when the spindle rotates, the lubricant creates a membrane between the spindle and the torrent, due to which the spindle rotates only on this membrane of the lubricant
 
 isliye dharuk kaa ghisaav bahut kam hota he or vah bhi dhuree ke puri raftaar pakadaney se pehle tathaa iske rukne ke samay hi haata he
 If the lubricant is given at the right time, then the dharuk lasts for many days
 aadhunik aakalp ke dharuk duusare dhang se banaae jate hai
 In factories, where the long axles have many torches, it is taken into account by the assumption that the axle alignment can be corrected in the vertical and horizontal direction by the administrative screws
 tej or baari dhuriyon ke dharak ke neeche ke bhaag main tel yaa snehak kaa ek aagaar rahata he
 Some torches have oil-filled palms at the bottom
 ye talp dhuree or dharuk ke bich main rahete hai or talp se ek batti chhed main se hoti hui tel ke kuen main chali jaati he
 Through this light, the oil gets oil all the time
 dharuk ke bich tel bhejne kii do reetiyaan hai, gurutv se yaa dabaav se
 The location of the maximum nipid of the membrane that this oil makes when moving inside the spindle is dependent on the speed of the spindle, the load and the direction of its rotation
 yadi kshaitij dhuree par, jo vamavart disha main gum rahi he bhaar daalaa jaae to mahattam daab kaa centre bich kii khadi rekha ke dahini ore 10 degree se 45 degree tak ke kone par milegaa or yah kone bhaar tathaa gati ke maan par aadhrut hoga
 Due to low speed and high load, the center of maximum pressure will be almost at the bottom of the torrent
 nunatam daab kaa kshetrafal, is dhuree ke liye upree bhaag main khadi rekha ke dahini or hoga
 If the direction of rotation of the axis is changed, the maximum and minimum pressure points will be to the left of the center line standing at the same angle
 jin dharukon main tel aakarshan se jaataa he unke liye tel ko nunatam daab ke sthaan par bheetar janaa chahie
 If there is a load on the main bearings, the oil from the upper part of the holders also works
 jahaan dabaav se tel diya he vahaan tel ke mahattam nipid ke sthaan ke paas se bheetar bhejnaa thik hoga
 This location should be in the same direction as the axis is rotating
 chote dharukon ko chhodkar anya sab dharukon main khaanche banaae jate hai, jisase tel sab sthanon par ek samaan fail jaataa he
 These grooves are not made at the places where the oil is niped, because the grooves at these places will give the oil an opportunity to move to places of low friction and the oil membrane will not be properly formed
 mukhya bering yaa jarnal main khaanche nahin banaae jate, balki dharukon main hi banaae jate hai, parantu tel ke bheetar aane ke sthaan se dhuree ke ghoomane kii disha kii ore janevaala khaanchaa adhik laabhadaayak he
 The friction coefficient, thr, of a given torrent is dependent on the characteristics of the oil
 dharuk kii dhaatu kaa prabhaav gharshan gunank ke upar avashya hota he, yah dhuree ke chalane or tel kii jhilli banane tathaa dhuree ke rukne yaa phir snehak ke gunon par nirbhar hota he
 Suppose a fine oil membrane is formed then the coefficient of conflict is based on oil, heat, speed and load
 gharshan gunank 0
005 yaa 0
002 achche snehak ke liye or 0
05 yaa isse adhik kharaab snehak ke liye hota he
 Without oil holders are also used in places where it is necessary to ensure that the oil spills do not spoil the goods produced by the machine, such as textile making machines
 yadi in mashiinon main telvaale dharuk hon to kapade par tel jarur giregaa, jisase kapadaa kharaab ho jayega
 Hence, these torrents are of different types
 ek dharuk main tel main bhigi hui lakdi lagaai jaati he, duusare main pital ke bhaag main graphit laga diya jaataa he, jiske kaaran gharshan bahut kam ho jaataa he
 Similar and other dharuks are also made, which do not require oil
 kuch aakalpan karanevaalon kaa vichaar he ki dhuree kii shakti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jarnal kaa vyas kam se kam rakhana chahie, jiske kaaran kam se kam ghisaav ho
 It is also said that if the speed of the spindle is to be kept high then the load on it should also be less
 parantu aadhunik aakalpan karanevaalon main yah sthir kiya he ki yadi dharuk kaa aakalpan thik prakaar se kiya jaae, to gati ke saath saath isapar bhaar bhi zyada daalaa ja saktaa he
 There will be no harm from this
 yah bhi siddh kar diya he ki dharuk kii lambaai kam karne se adhik laabh hota he, visheshkar zyada gati kii dhuree ke liye yah bahut jaruri he
 Less long torrents will not tilt
 iske kaaran dharuk ke bheetar nipid har sthaan par baraabar hoga
 Therefore, by keeping the length of the blade less than its diameter, the speed of the axle can also be increased and the load on the axis can also be increased
 iskaa dhyaan rahe ki yadi dharukon kii lambaai adhik kam ho gai to iske bheetar kaa nipid bad jayega, jiske kaaran dhuree main jakad paidaa ho sakati he or agar lambaai adhik ho gai to dharuk main jhukaav paidaa ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the ratio of length and diameter of the blade should be kept in such a way that neither there is fear of bending nor can it be curved
 isi kaaran yah anupaat pani ke jahaaj kii dhuree ke liye 1 : 1
5, sthapit injanon ke liye 1
2 : 2
5, saral baari dhuree ke liye 2 : 3 or 3 : 4 rakhaa jaataa he
 There are many types of Dharuk
 inamen har ek kaa upyog alag alag he : Rivet Dharuk is made for the vertical axis
 isamen "va" ek bandhani he, jisko mashin main ksaa jaataa he
 This bandhani has a brass torch, in which the axles are attached
 dhuree kaa puraa bhaar dharuk ke aadhaar par rahata he
 It is made semicircular and in this part there is oil or lubricant
 ek pariksha ke fal se yah pataa chalaa he ki yadi is dharuk ke aadhaar main ek khaanchaa banaakar usamen tel bhar diya jaae to dhuree ke chalane par yah tel upar kii ore jaataa he or dhuree ke baraabar se hota hua baahar nikal jaataa he
 If this exhaled oil is sent back in, then this oil can be used again and again and there will never be any oil inside the torrent
 is prakaar kii dhuree par bhaar adhik hone se kilak par adhik daab ho jaaegi, jiske kaaran dharuk vifal ho saktaa he
 Therefore, no more than 15 kg per square centimeter of pressure is applied on this type of torrent
 isse adhik daab hone par galpatt dharuk kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 This type of holders are used in places where there is more load on the axle
 is dharuk kaa pital do bhaagon main hota he, jinamein dhuree ke padon ke anusaar khaanche bane hote hai
 In these grooves the positions of the spindle are seated and this joint is removed in the limb ligament
 is prakaar har ek pad alag alag kaam karata he or dhuree kaa bhaar in padon main bant jaataa he
 These holders are kept cool by water
 yadi yah dharuk thik prakaar thande rakhe jaaen or inamen thik samay par tel bhi diya jaataa rahe to yah adhik chaal or daab sahan kar sakate hai or adhik dinon tak chal sakate hai
 In the torrents described so far, the axis of the spindle rotates at the bottom of the torch and due to the serpentine friction, the metals of both are weakened
 isi gharshan ko kam karne ke liye ghoomanevaale talon ke bich belan yaa goliyon ko baitha diya jaataa he
 Thus, both the floors rotate on the cylinders and the cylinder friction works in place of the serpentine friction, due to which the heating and wear is greatly reduced, but when these holders are worn, they cannot be arranged like other holders, but rather They have to change
 ye dharuk bahut majboot hote hai or kam gharshan ke kaaran inase adhik gati bhi praapt hoti he
 Goli Gharuk is also made like this
 isaki goliyaan donon baajuon ke bich rahati hai
 The only difference is that in Goli Dharuk the load is on the points and the cylinder is on the weight lines in Dharuk
 isliye bhaar itnaa adhik nahin hona chahie ki baajuon par khaanche yaa gadhe pad jaaen
 The cylinder and pellet and arm are all made of hardened steel
 ek dharuk ke samast belanon athwa goliyon kaa pariman ek samaan hona aavashyak he nahin to bade pariman kii goli par adhik bhaar hoga or dharuk vifal ho jayega
 From the above mentioned things, it will be known that oil is an essential thing for a Dharuk to function properly
 jarnal or dharuk ke bich yah tel halaki jhilli bana letaa he, jiske kaaran donon dhaatuen ek duusare se nahin mil paatin or jarnal isi jhilli par ghumta rahata he
 If for some reason the oil in the Dharuk gets reduced, then it breaks the oil membrane and the metal of the journal starts to rub with the metal of the Dharuk, which causes the Dharuk and the journal to overheat
 is taapan se donon dhaatuen fail jaati hai or dharuk jarnal ko jakad letaa he
 The journal of the machine is the part which costs more than the torrent and protects it from spoilage
 isi ko bachaane ke liye dharuk ke pital main khaanche banaakar unamem shwet dhaatu bhar di jaati he
 When, for some reason, the torch begins to heat up, then the metal melts and runs between the journal and the torrent and the entire axis stops
 isliye jarnal ke bina kam ushma or gharshan se ghoomane ke liye do baton kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he : If there is friction in the torrent, then some of the power of the shaft is lost in the torrent and the amount of useful work is reduced somewhat

 Aurangzeb gave him the title of 'sawai' - which symbolically means that he was 'sawaiya' from his contemporaries
 suna jaataa he jab dilli badshaah aurangzeb ke darbar main yuva savai jaisingh pehle-pahal hajir hue, to pataa nahin kyon aurangzeb ne ekaek balak jaisingh ke donon haath pakad liye or poocha "ab bataaiye, aap kya karenge?" is par pratyutpannmati jaisingh hothon par muskaan liye nihaayat shant swar se bole, "alampanaah ! hamaare yahaan hinduon main vivaah par ek parampara he

"aurangzeb did not expect this clever reply, but he was very pleased with this wise presence
 , The words Yadunath Sarkar has written about this 'title' in his Jaipur history - unquestionably - "the new Rajah also gained the title of Sawai, which means 'one and a quarter', because Aurangzeb was so pleased

 When he had disobeyed many royal orders, the king eventually sent some of them to Amer to bring them 'forcibly'
 Annoyed by his absence, Emperor Aurangzeb did not take away the title of Amer Raja from him, but on 13 September 1701, he was 'demoted', making him a modest mansabdar of only 500 castes, 100 riders

 Jai Singh received this award for the six-year 'hard service' of the emperor! After this, when Shahzada Bidarbakht became the Subedar of Malve, he made him the Deputy Subedar there, respecting the services of Jaisingh, which Aurangzeb immediately 'disallowed' and wrote a decree that Ainda even a Hindu to a minor faujdar
 Neither should be made

 These soldiers of these two kings fought a fierce battle in Sambhar on October 3, 1708, in which the Mughals won
 yuddh ke baad vijay kii khushi main mughalon kii mehfil ho rahi thi
 At the same time, under the leadership of Rao Sangram Singh, the Naruka fighters reached there and climbed on a sand dune, under which Syed etc
 was making a great deal
 narrukon ne un par ekaek banduukon or tiron se bhayanak hamalaa kiya
 All the Mughal soldiers were killed in it and the winning stake of the Mughals went out of hand
 phir jaisingh ne ek patr badshaah ke viruddh durgadas ko likhaa ki "udaipur maharana se baat kii jaae

 badshaah ne inke jabt kiye rajya waapas lautaa die or in donon ko 4000 jaat 4000 savaar ke mansab bhi diye
 Even at that time, the Rajputs had no faith in the Mughals, so when Sawai Jaisingh went to the Emperor's camp in Ajmer, all the mountains and valleys of Ajmer were filled with Rajput soldiers
 mansab badhane or ilaake waapas aane par bhi unhen bahadurshah kii niyat par kabhi bhi purna vishwaas nahin hua
 Something happened to Jaisingh's brother Vijay Singh too that after being disappointed, he finally left the Mughal court and came to Hindaun
 jaisingh ko bhai vijaisingh kii taraf se sashastr vidroh khatra to bana hua tha hi
 In 1713 AD, in the name of compromising Vijay Singh and 'meeting the Rajmata', he along with his armed soldiers and chieftains went to Sanganer and imprisoned them fraudulently and sent them to Jaigad Fort

 At that time, 20 thousand Rajput riders were present in Delhi and Buddha Singh Hada of Bundi was also with them
 parantu badshaah kii yah sainya kaarywai karne kii himmat nahin hui
 He kept trying to please the Syed
 ant main saiyadon ne badshaah se jaisingh ko dilli se jane ko kahalava diya
 Jaisingh warned the emperor that his departure would threaten the emperor's life, but this advice was not understood by the emperor

 Finally, At Singh took Jaisingh with him to Jodhpur where he married his daughter to Jaisingh
 saiyadon ne jaisingh ko 20 lakh rupee diye, jisase ve amer vaapis brahmanon se waapas khariden

 While returning, Deep Singh also met the Nizam, but in September 1730, his agreement with Malwa was not resolved
 buddhasingh bundi or unki kushwahi rani ke aapas main gambhir matbhed paidaa hone par jaisingh ke sambandh bhi bundi naresh buddhasingh se bahut kharaab ho gayi
 In the end, the relations deteriorated so much that Jai Singh made the King of Bundi the king of Salim Singh Hada of Karwar in place of Buddha Singh, and called him the king, and later married his daughter
 isse rajasthan main jaipur or bundi ke bich lambe samay tak bada du:khad sangharsh chalaa

 chaar dwayoshnay sparsh vyanjan hai jinamein ghoshtv evam pranatv jaise do swanimidbhilakshanon dwaara chaar dwayoshnay sparsh swanim praapt hote hai - in chaaro keliye prayukt devanagari varnmaala ke chaar varna yahaan die gaye hai
 The other three similar touch consonants are: dantya Holly and kanthy a similar consonant class of rhythmic sounds comes under tactile consonant consonant sounds, although some linguists have also put it with tactile sounds
 ye vyanjan swanim hai 
 Struggle - There are three phonemes in consonant sounds: "letter" is used for dantya / varsity sound / s / while "ha" is used for / h / / / / kaukaran in the Hindi language stream
 At some stage, two different forms were performed, ie, talavya / / / एवं एवं and idolatry / / / दो दो were considered two separate phonemes and two varnas were also used for these two - -a-tālavya and मूर्udhārya which is now also Devanagari
 Le In the script as it is used, today there is not much difference between the two at the sound level, only the palatal struggling consonant phonemes / sw / / which form becomes idyllic instead of being rhythmic with the intangible sounds
 jaise ksht, nasht
 In the words of vision etc
 before idol "t"
 isiilie inhen ek hiswanim ke do upswan maananaa anuchit na hoga
 Apart from this, four struggling sounds have come to Hindi through Arabic Persian words and have now become part of the sound system of Hindi
 ye dhvaniyaan hai - fadvayoshnay sangharshi vyanjan swanim / / , za jo ki dantya dhwani sa kaa hi saghosh rup he / / or kanthy dhvaniyaan kh / d / aghosh kanthy sangharshi or isi kaa saghosh dhwani rup ga
 Nasikya - In the Devanagari alphabet we also get a nasal consonant color at the end of every touch or touch-struggling class such as there is a soft nasal sound with soft sounds, then there is a sound with tangible sounds, there is idolatry, with jauva sounds, talavas nasikya Is and is written with dentin and bicontinuous nasal, with dentinal nasal and bicontinuous / m / respectively
 is

 Arthas-na-nath are nasal sounds with interrogative functions when a and j are combined with nāसिकāsikya in the complementary distribution - n is pronounced as kāyakya nākya a, before kā कंya sounds, then before tāनाya sounds
 Occurs in the form

 There are two different phonemes, the exclamatory sounds / / / and its accusative form dh / / / , showing the contrast with the plumed sound
 ye donondhvaniyaan or murdhanya nasiky vyanjan na shabdon ke shuru main prayog nahin kiejate
 In addition to these consonant sounds, there are also two half-words / y / and / t / in Hindi, for which y and script symbols are used respectively

 a Public Interest Litigation can be filed when the following conditions can be met: • There must be a public injury and public misconduct caused by the act or omission of the state or public authority
 • It is for the enforcement of basic human rights of the weaker sections of the community who are Dalit, ignorant and whose fundamental and constitutional rights have been violated

 yah aavashyak he ki yachikakarta apni khud kii kuch chot saamana karnaa padaa he yaa vyaktigat karne ke liye muqadama shikaayat kii thi nahin he
 Public interest litigation is a right granted to a socially conscious member or a public spirited NGO to handle a public cause by judicial demand for the prevention of public injury
 Such injury or public duty may arise from a violation of the reason for violating some provision of the Constitution

 Procedure in High Court: a PIL is to be filed in the High Court and then to be filed in two copies of the petition
 iske alaava, yachika kii ek agrim prati ke liye prayek prativaadee, arthath vipareet party par kaary kiya janaa he or seva ke is saboot ke liye yachika par chipka ho gaya he

 In 1982, the Supreme Court recognized that unusual measures were warranted to enable people to realize not only their full civil and political rights, but enjoy economic, social and cultural rights and in its far-reaching judgment, in the case of PUDR, it Recognition that through a third party direct petition, a letter or other means, seeking a court case and its intervention, regardless of where a cross t were being violated fundamental rights

 However, as there is no statute laying down rules and regulations for a PIL, a Court can treat a PIL as a PIL, should bring true and clear facts and indeed the matter is the immediate one, the court If the letters can be treated it is a public interest litigation but still it depends on the facts and circumstances and the court has complete discretion

 The rich tradition of Buddhism and ancient remains of its archeology in Chhattisgarh are testimony to this fact
 wensang kii yatra se is sambandh kii pushti hoti he
 The route of the journey to Weinsang passed through Chhattisgarh and it states that there was a walkway from Chhattisgarh to China through which many Buddhist monks have been coming here for preaching
 is yatra ke pramaan sirpur, raigarh ke chini shailchitron aadi main aaj bhi milte hai
 The nature of Chhattisgarh and its historical significance has attracted many Vidasi scholars
 angrej to yahan shaasha ban kar aae auki chhattisgarh kii prakritik sampada par mugdh ho gaye lekin kuch vidwaanon ne is anchal se hokar yatraayen kii
 In these journeys, there was also the Chinese-traveler Whensang, who recorded Chhattisgarh in the pages of the history of the world through his journey
 wensang kii yatra kaa sankshipt kintu mahatvapurn laabh yah hua ki unhone nagarjun ko dakshin kosal kaa vataya or dakshin kosal chhattisgarh kaa pracheen naam he
 Whinsang's real name was Yuvan Changas

 In its second part, the visit of When Song revealed the fact that even the feet of Lord Buddha were lying on the soil of Chhattisgarh
 when sang ke yatra-vrutant main shripur yani aaj ke sirpur kaa mahatvapurn ullekh he
 This visit also proves that some parts of Chinese culture exist in this region as well
 chhattisgarh ke anek kandaraon- gufaaon main shail chitra ukere gaye hai jo china main paae gaye shailchitron ke samatuly hai
 The facts of the historical book say that Ween Song saw 100 Sangharao and 1000 Mahayani Buddhist monks residing here
 sirpur utkhanan se praapt murtiyon ke vishaal bhandar jin par badhyaani pathiyon kaa prabhutv dikhaai detaa he tathaa ye murtiyon tantravaad kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai
 This proves that when the Song Sang came to Shripur
 usne shripur ke dashrin ko ore ek puraane vihaar evam ashok stupa kaa varnan kiya he yahan bhagwaan buddha ne shastrarth main vidwaanon ko parajeet kar apni anaukik shakti kaa pradarshan kiya tha
 Historians also say that it is a historical truth that Ashoka built the stupa on the places where Lord Buddha had sanctified with his feet
 vene sang kaa yatra vrutant jo is tathy ko satya ke najadik laata he
 History The famous Chinese traveler, Weinsang, mentions four suns illuminating the world

 According to Chinese accounts Nagarjuna was an astronomer, astrologer, biologist, mineralogist, chemist and eminent physician
 tibeti main nagarjun ke liye kals grab shabd kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 When Chhattisgarh's visit to Wensang becomes important in the sense that he added the relationship of Nagarjuna to the land of South Kosala
 atyant ucchkoti ke vyakttatv ke swami nagarjun ek mahaan darshanikthe, unhone buddha darshan ke madhyamik sampradaay kaa pravartan kiya tathaa buddha dharm ke mahayan shakha ke ve sansthaapak maane jate hai
 The philosophy "nihilism" presented by him became famous in the world

 He addresses Nagarjuna with the Sun illuminating the world and the Bodhisattva
 wensang buddha dharm ke mahayan shakha ke anuyaayi the or nagarjun in shakha ke sansthaapak maane jate hai
 It is, therefore, natural that after taking hundreds of pains to visit India from China, Wensang came to the birthplace and abode of his crime Nagarjuna, filled with many kinds of curiosities
 shripur wensang ke liye tirth sthaan tha kyonki vahaan bhagwaan buddha ke charan sparsh hue the or nagarjun yahan nivas karte the
 Chinese traveler Whensang first directs the exact position and extent of the South Kosala district

 The Chinese traveler passed through Kalinga, crossing the mountainous and forested areas in the northeast, reaching South Kosal after traveling about 600 km
 uske anusaar dakshin kosal janapad yaa rajya kaa vistaar 1775 kilometre kii paridhi main tha
 Many scholars have determined the boundaries of South Kosal district with this description of Chinese traveler
 chini yaatr wensang ne dakshin kosal kii tatkaaleen, rajdhani sirpur kaa jis samay pravaas kiya tha, us samay somvanshi raja mahashivagupt balarjun vahaan rajya karata tha
 Before this, Somvanshi King Trivaradeva, located in Sirpur, had carved the testimonies of Rajim and Sihava in which he is inscribed Kosalaadhipati
 idhan wensang apane yatra-vivaran main likhte hai- “ maury raja ashok ne dakshin kosal kii rajdhani main stupa tathaa anya imaaraton kaa nirmaan karaayaa tha
 This mention of the Chinese traveler is not incorrect
