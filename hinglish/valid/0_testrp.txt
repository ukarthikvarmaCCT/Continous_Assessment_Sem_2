 The Mongol language is the language of the Altaic language and of a summative design
 yah mukhyat: anatantr mongol, bhitari mongol ke swatantra pradesh, buryaat mongol rajya main boli jaati he
 Arrits of these areas are also found in its spoken Manchuria, some areas of China and Tibet and Afghanistan etc
 anumaan he ki in sab kshetron main mongol bhashaa bolanewaalon kii sankhya koi 40 lakh hogi
 There is no one ideal language accepted by everyone of the Mongol race living in these vast areas
 parantu tathakthith mongolia ke andar janatantr mongol kii halha boli dhire-dhire adarsh bhashaa kaa pad grahan kar rahi he
 The people of Mongolia themselves consider this Halha dialect a sophisticated dialect and this dialect is likely to become an ideal language in the near future
 pracheen kaal main mongol lipi main likhi janevaali saahitiyik mongol padhe-likhe logon main adarsh bhashaa maani jaati thi
 But now this Mongol script has been abandoned by the Republic of Mongolia and a new Mongol script made from Russian script has been accepted in its place
 is prakaar ab mongol lipi main likhi janevaali saahitiyik bhashaa kam or nav mongol lipi main likhi janevaali halha boli adhik maanya samajhi jane lagi he
 Mongol language is divided into several dialects
 mukhya boliyaan nimnlikhit hai: East mongol uttari shakha- buryaat boliyaan uttari boli ttari boli purvi boli Southern Branch - Chahar Boli pashchimi mongol Oirat Branch - cobt kii oirat Retail bids dagore hailler boli; chichihar boli Monguur Boli mogol boli Other bids mongol bhashaa kaa itihaas pracheen, madhya tathaa aadhunik, in teen kaalon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 The language up to 12th century is called ancient Mongol, the language from 13th to 16th century is medieval Mongol and the language after 17th century is called modern Mongol
 madhyakaalin or aadhunik mongol main bahut antar nahin he
 There is no clear known ancient Mongol
 mongol sahitya kaa itihaas 13veen shatabdi ke madhya bhaag main bane mongolia ke rahasy kaa itihaas se aarambh hota he
 The so-called modern literature begins in the vicinity of the 1921 unrest, but until now the compositions of importance are not much
 aadhunik sahitya ke janm se purv 1920 tak kii saat shatabdiyon main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe gaye-mongolia ke rahasy kaa itihaas, gager khan kii katha or janagar The book titled "history of the Secret of Mongolia" has a history ranging from the birth of the Mongol race to the Chingis Khan and with special emphasis on the Chingis Khan
 yah bahut saral or sundar bhashaa main likhaa gaya he tathaa bich bich main kavitaayen bhi mili hui hai
 In it, the history of the Mongols of small weaker castes gathered together to form a central government, changed from a family oriented society to a Jagirdari society, and a small Jagirdar gathered to become a very strong country
 "geser khan kii katha" puranic katha par aadhaarit ek purush kii kahani he
 In this, the public fighting against the vassal and the priestly class has been praised
 "jangar" pashchimi mongolia main bani ek aitihaasik katha he
 In it, the emphasis is on the welfare and happiness of the public through the actions of a man
 aitihaasik granthon main itihaas kaa mani, sunaharaa itihaas bahut prasiddh hai
 Both are chronicles of Chingis Khan and his successors
 inamen pracheen mongol kii puranic kathaayen, lokthaayen aadi sankalit hai
 Modern literature has evolved from the people's revolution against the 1921 revolution and the Jagirdari system
 is sangharsh ke itihaas par aadhaarit samaajawaadee yathartwaadee vichapar hi aadhunik sahitya kaa mul strot he
 Writers of this period like D
 Nacagdorji, C, Damding sureng, C
 Lodoidamba, D

 The compounds that have the same properties also have the same organization and those whose properties are different also have different organizations
 baad main paaya gaya ki kuch aise yogic bhi hai jinke sanghathan, anubhaar tathaa anu-avyav ek hote hue bhi, unke gunon main vibhinnata he
 Such specificity compounds were called isomorphic nouns and this fact was named isomerism
 samavyawata pradhanthya do prakaar kii hoti he : ek ko sanrachana samavyawata or duusare ko trivim samavyawata kehete hai
 If the two molecules have the same molecular weight and molecular mass, but differ in their properties, this may be the reason that their molecule's structures differ
 aise do saralatam yogic ethil alcodaul or diemethil ether hai, jinka anubhaar tathaa anusutra, C2 H6 O, ek hi he, par inke sanrachanasutra bhinn hai
 In ethyl alcohol, two carbon atoms are interconnected, combined with the hydroxyl group, while in dimethyl ether, two carbon atoms are related to each other by oxygen atoms
 donon ke gunon main bahut bhinnata he
 Variation is evident from their action
 ethil alcodaul par HI kii kriya se ethil iodide, C2 H5 I, banataa he, jabaki diemethil ether se methil iodide, banataa he
 Similar repercussions also occur with other reagents
 yadi aise yogicon kii samavyawata aisi samavyawata ek hi shrenee ke yogicon ke bich ho, to aisi samavyawata ko madhyavyavta kehete hai
 Examples of this are diethyl ether and methyl propyl ether
 paraphin shrenee ke hydrocarbonon main aise anek udhaaharan milte hai
 There are three aggregates of pentane: normal pentane, iso-pentane and neopentane
 aisi samavyawata ko shrunkhlaa samavyawata bhi kehete hai, kyonki yahan shrunkhlaa main hi antar hone ke kaaran vibhinnata he
 Similar to this isomerism, there is a second isomerism, called place-isomerism, the simplest example being propyl chloride and isopropyl chloride, the difference of which relates only to the location of the chlorine atom
 ek main chlorine ant ke ek carbon parmaanu se sambhddha he or duusare main chlorine madhya ke carbon se sambhddha he
 Similar isomerism also occurs in dichlorobenzones
 yogicon ke anubhaar or sanrachana ke ek rahete hue bhi parmaanuon ke vibhinn dishaao main vyavasthit rahane ke kaaran yogic main samavyawata ho sakati he
 Such isomerism is called three-dimensional isomerism
 trivim samavyawata do prakaar kii hoti he : Studies of lactic acid have seen that there are three types of lactic acid, two optically active and one optically inactive
 isi prakaar tarteric amla bhi chaar prakaar kaa hota he, do prakaashat: sakriy or do prakaashat: niskriy
 The satisfactory explanation of their presence could not be from the principles known up to that time
 inaki vyakhya ke liye jo siddhant pratipaadit hua he, use trivim samavyawata kaa siddhant kehete hai or isse rasayan kii ek nai shakha kii neenv padi he, jise trivim rasayan kehete hai
 The proponent of this new theory may be Dutch chemist, Vant Hoff and another French chemist, La Bell
 ye donon rup vaise hi hai jaise koi ek vastu or uskaa pratibimb hota he
 One arrangement rotates the light one way, the other arrangement rotates in the opposite direction of the light
 is prakaar aise yogic ke do prakaashiya rup ho sakate hai
 If both of these forms exist in a solution in the equilibrium, then such a solution will be lightly inert
 vastut: niskriy lactic aml aisa hi mishran he, kyonki fyaha anek vidhiyon se do sakriy lactic amlon main vibhedit kiya ja saktaa he
 The carbon atom in the middle of the tetrahedron is called asymmetric carbon atom and it is mandatory for light activation to have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms
 iske abhaav main prakaashiya sakriyata sambhav nahin he
 This is proved by experience and experiment
 tartenrik amla main do asamamit carbon parmaanu hote hai
 The characteristic of tartaric acid is that both of its asymmetric carbons are associated with the same type of group
 yadi donon asamamit carbon ke saath aise samooh sambhddha hon jo dakshinvart hai, to vah yogic dakshinavart hoga tathaa yadi donon asamamit carbonon ke saath aise samooh sambhddha hon jo vamavart hai, to vah yogic vamavart hoga or yadi donon asamamit carbon ke saath ek dakshinavart or doosraa vamavart samooh sambhddha ho, to ek ke prabhaav ko doosraa niskriy kar degaa, jisase vah yogic prakaashat: niskriy hoga
 But this compound will be so inactive that it cannot be made active
 aisa hi tarteric amla kaa rup mezo-tarteric amla he
 The fourth tartaric acid can be such that there is an equilibrium of tartaric acid clockwise and counterclockwise
 aisa yogic racemic amla he
 It is also apparently inactive, but can be differentiated into active ingredients
 is prakaar is siddhant se chaar prakaar ke tarteric amla kii upasthiti kii vyakhya saralata se ho jaati he
 This type of stereoscopic isomerism is not only found in organic compounds, but also in compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, sulfur and silicon, etc
 jyamitiya samavyawata main prakaash sakriyata nahin hoti
 This isomerism is found in the same compounds in which two carbon atoms are bound by pair bond
 yadi aise yogicon ke donon carbon parmaanuon se ek se adhik samooh sambhddha hon, to usase nimnlikhit prakaar ke do yogic ban sakate hai
 One, in which both groups are on the same side and another, in which both groups are on the opposite side
 pehle yogicon ko sis or duusare ko trens kehete hai
 In such compounds, the molecule is strongly bonded, blocking its free conductance
 aise samavyav yogicon ke saralatam udhaaharan malaik or fumeric amla hai
 In malic acid, both carboxylic groups are on the same side and in fumaric acid both carboxylic groups are on the opposite side
 isaki pushti is baat se hoti he ki malaik amla ati sheeghra ainhydride banaata he, jo carboxil samooh kii nikatataa ko pradarshit karata he or fumeric amla itnaa jald ainhydride nahin banaata, jo carboxil samooh kii duuri ko pradarshit karata he
 Even if anhydride is formed by hardness, it is only maleic anhydride
 aisi samavyawata ke liye yah aavashyak nahin ki ek carbon parmaanu duusare carbon parmaanu ke saath hi sanyukt ho
 Even if carbon is combined with nitrogen, such isobases are formed
 iske udhaaharan anek oxim hai, jo kitone par hydranksil amin kii kriya se banate hai
 a second type of isomorphism is called movable isomerism, or movability
 yah yogicon main kisi tatv ke, visheshat: hydrogen ke, ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par sthanantaran se hoti he
 a good example of this is keto-inole-isomerism, in which the same substance sometimes behaves as ketone and sometimes inole
 yahan ek samaavyavi kaa duusare samaavyavi main parivartan keval vilayaakon main ghulaane se, athwa kisi utprerak kii upasthiti se hi sampann hota he
 Such isomerism causes variable rotation of the sugars
 1810 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 1810 BCE or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 1810 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 59 million years ago, the Strait of Gibraltar gradually closed and the links between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic were severed
 samay ke saath bumadhya sagar suukhta gaya or iske pani main namak kaa sankendran badhata gaya
 It is estimated that if the Strait of Gibraltar is closed today, in 1000 years much of the Mediterranean Sea water will dry up and become a dilapidated salt basin

 vanasur ne bhagwaan shankar kii badi kathin tapasya kii
 Pleased with his tenacity, Shankar Ji gave him a thousand arms and immense force
 uske sahastra bahu or apaar bal ke bhay se koi bhi usase yuddh nahin karata tha
 For this reason, the merchant became very egoistic
 bahut kaal vyateet ho jane ke pashchaat bhi jab usase kisi ne yuddh nahin kiya to vah ek din shankar bhagwaan ke paas aakar bolaa, "he charachar jagat ke ishwar! mujhe yuddh karne kii prabal ichha ho rahi he kintu koi bhi mujhase yuddh nahin karata
 So please do battle with me
 " uski ahankaarpurn baat ko sun kar bhagwaan shankar ko krodh aayaa kintu vanasur unka parambhakt tha isaliye apane krodh kaa shaman kar unhone kaha, "re murkh! tujhse yuddh karke tere ahankaar ko chur-chur karne vaala utpann ho chukaa he
 When the flag of your palace falls, then only understand that your enemy has arrived
 " There was a girl named Usha of Vamsur
 ek baar ushaa ne swapn main shri krishna ke pautra tathaa pradhyumna ke putr aniruddh ko dekha or usapar mohit ho gai
 He told his dream to his friend Chitralekha
 chitralekha ne apane yogabal se aniruddh kaa chitra banaaya or ushaa ko dikhaaya or poocha, "kya tumne isi ko swapn main dekha tha?" is par ushaa boli, "haan, yahi meraa chitachor he
 Now i can not live without them
 " chitralekha ne dwarika jaakar sote huye aniruddh ko palang sahit ushaa ke mahal main pahunchaa diya
 On waking sleep, Anirudh found himself in a new place and saw that he had an indefinable beauty sitting next to him
 aniruddh ke poochne par ushaa ne bataaya ki vah vanasur kii putree he or aniruddh ko pati rup main paane kii kaamana rakhti he
 Anirudh too became fascinated with Usha and started living with her in the palace
 paharedaaron ko sandeh ho gaya ki ushaa ke mahal main avashya koi bahari manushya aa pahunchaa he
 He went and told about his suspicion from Vamsur
 usee samay vanasur ne apane mahal kii dhwaja ko giri hui dekha
 He is convinced that some of my enemies have entered Usha's palace
 vah astr shastr se susajjit hokar ushaa ke mahal main pahunchaa
 He saw that a dark-colored Salona man with big eyes is sitting near his daughter Usha
 vanasur ne krodhit ho kar aniruddh ko yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 Hearing his challenge, Anirudh also presented for the war and he picked up a fierce iron pot and killed all the bodyguards of Vansur by that
 vanasur or aniruddh main ghor yuddh hone laga
 When Vayanasura saw that Anirudh was not under his control in any way, he tied him to Nagpash and made him a prisoner
 idhar dwarika puri main aniruddh kii khoj hone lagi or unke na milane par vahaan par shok or ranj chaa gaya
 Then Devarshi Narada reached there and told all the accounts of Anirudh
 is par shri krishna, balram, pradhyumna, satyikee, gad, samb aadi sabhi vir chaturangini sena ke saath lekar vanasur ke nagar shonitpur pahunche or akraman karke vahaan ke udyaan, parcote, burj aadi ko nasht kar diya
 On hearing the news of the attack, the consort also brought his army along
 shri balram ji kumbhand tathaa coopakarna rakshason se ja bhide, aniruddh kartikeya ke saath yuddh karne lage or shri krishna vanasur ke saamne aa date
 There was a fierce struggle

 Balarama killed Kumbhanda and Kuppakarna
 jab banasur ko lagane laga kii wo shrikrishna ko nahin haraa saktaa to use bhagwan shankar kii baat yaad aayi
 Finally he remembered Bhagwan Shankar
 banasur kii pukaar sunakar bhagwaan shiv ne rudraganon kii sena ko banasur kii sahaayta ke liye bhej diya
 The army of Shivagans attacked Shri Krishna from all four, but they had to face defeat in front of Shri Krishna and Sribalram
 Shrikrishna then broke down on Banasura after defeating Shiva
 ant main apane bhakt kii raksha ke liye swayan bhagwaan rudra ranbhumi main aaye
 Lord Shiva asked Shri Krishna to go back, but when Shri Krishna was not ready to retreat in any way, Lord Shiva raised his trident
 There was a war with Kartikeya and Sri Krishna would fight for Mahadev
 shrikrishna ke baanon se shiv kii sena kaanpane lagi or vahaan se bhaag gai
 Now both of them started fighting fiercely
 All the weapons of Shri Krishna failed in front of Shivji
 In the end, Shri Krishna gave his Narayanastra on Shivji
 lekin vah bhi shivaji ke saamne nishprabh ho gaya
 In the end, Shri Krishna realized that while living in the battleground of Shiva, he would not be able to tie the hair of Banasura
 atah unhone shiv kii stuti prarambh kii
 Shivji said in delight, o Krishna, by breaking the promise given to Banasura, i cannot move away from the battlefield
 tathaapi ek upaay bataata hoon
 You use hysterics on me uskaa mai pratikaar nahi karunga
 I'll sleep for a while
 shrikrishna ne vaise hi kiya
 After Lord Shiva fell asleep, Shri Krishna again broke down on Banasura
 Banasura too broke down on him in extreme anger
 Finally, Shri Krishna turned his Sudarshan Chakra and started cutting the arms of Banasura
 shrikrishna ne vanasur kii chaar baaju chhodkar baaki sab baaju kaat daali
 Then the awakened Lord Shiva said to Vānāsura "ray fool, this is the incarnation of Krishna, Vishnu, in front of you, you should leave your arrogance or else you will have to face my anger too"
 bhagwaan shiv kii baat maanakar shrikrishna ne banasur ko marane kaa vichaar tyaag diya bhagwaan shankar kii baat sunakar vanasur shrikrishna ke charnon main ja gira or unase kshamaa maangane laga
 Sri Krishna granted pardon to Vayanasura and Usha married Anirudh

 Dipolar disorder is a serious type of mental disorder that is a type of mood disorder
 is rog se grasit rogi kii manodasha baari-baari se do vipareet avasthaaon main jaati rahati he
 One mood is called fad or mania and the other mood is depression
 sanak kii manodasha main rogi ati-ashaavadi ho saktaa he; apane bare me badi-chadhi dharna rakh saktaa he ; vyakti ati-kriyasheel ho saktaa he ; rogi sona nahin chahta yaa sone ko anaavashyak kahata he aadi
 On the other hand, in a mood of depression, the patient remains depressed; He feels tired; Feels guilty or lacks hope
 aise vyakti kaa mood jaldi-jaldi badalata he
 Whenever he feels absolutely happy, he suddenly reaches a state of depression
 khushi or dukh donon hi avasthaaen saamaanya nahin hoti he
 This state of happiness is called menic
 dridhruvi vikaar ko mukhyat: teen shreniyon main baanta gaya he- This disorder affects both men and women
 chunki yah mastishk ke prakaayon ko prabhavit karata he jisase iskaa prabhaav logon ke sochane, vyavhaar or mahasoos karne main dekha aata he
 This makes it difficult for other people to understand their situation
 saamanyat: vayaskon main ye sthiti ek hafte se lekar, ek maheene tak rahati he
 In many cases it may be less than this
 menic or depressant kii sthiti aniyamit hoti he or iskaa saathi bhi samaan nahin hota
 That is, its symptoms are not always the same
 har vyakti ke vyaktvi ke anusaar ye alag-alag prakat hote hai

 isse grasit logon ke liye madiraa or drugs behad hanikaarak siddh hote hai or vah vyakti kii sthiti ko zyada kharaab kar dete he jisase chikitsak ke liye uskaa upachaar karnaa adhik mushkil ho jaataa he
 No universally accepted scientific solution of Dridruvi mood disorder has been revealed so far
 zyaadaatar vaigyanik iske liye jaivaracinic, anuvaanshik or vaataavaran ko uttaradaayi maanate hai
 This is due to imbalance in brain chemicals
 snayusanchari main asantulan kii vajah se mood ko niyantrit karne vaala system gadabada jaataa he
 At the same time, genes are also major factors for this
 yadi kisi ke sage sambandhi ko dridhruvi vikaar he to us vyakti ko iske hone kii sambhaavna kaaphi had tak bad jaati he
 It should also not be interpreted that it will happen to him as well
 vahiin maahaul ko bhi manovaigyanik is vikaarake liye uttaradaayi maanate he
 Due to death of a person in the family, divorce of parents and many other traumatic accidents, the person becomes a victim
 mastishk kii sanrachana main kharabi ke kaaran bhi ye vikaar hota he
 Some studies have shown that such a problem occurs because of disturbances in the mandula, prefrontal cartex, and hippocampus
 dridhruvi mood vikarako pahchaan kar iskaa upachaar kiya ja saktaa he
 It is not very difficult to detect the symptoms of this disorder in adults
 bacchon or tinagers main iske lakshan vayaskon kii tarah nahin hote hai, aise main inamen lakshan pahchaanane main samasya aati he
 The current and past experiences of tngers are examined before treatment
 iske alaava parivaar ke sadsy or doston se bhi vyakti ke vyavhaar ke bare main jaankaree lee jaati he
 It is sometimes considered in teenagers as post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which makes it difficult to treat
 upachaar mukhyat: vyavhaarik lakshanon or sanketon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 Tests are done later
 jaise siti scan brain bentricells kaa bada rup dikhaata he
 The same bright spot can be seen by MRI of the brain mishigan vishvavidhyalay main hue ek adhyayan main saamne aayaa ki dridhruvi mood vikaarawale logon main rasayan kaa snav karne vaali dimagi koshikaon kii sankhya aam logon kii tulana main 30 pratishat zyada hoti he

 yah ek jaharila padaarth he
 On heating the white phosphorus to 250 in the presence of nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas, it turns into a red phosphorus
 yah laal rang kaa ravedas thos padaarth hota he jiskaa ghanatv 2
5 tathaa kvathanank 582 hota he
 When it is cooled to 550 ° c in the presence of Ti2 / N2 or prsa2 / CO2 gas, it transforms back into white phosphorus when it is cooled abruptly
 iske atirikt phosphorus ke anya aparrup mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Phosphorite powder is prepared by heating with sand and coke in an electric furnace at 1000 ° C
 calcium silicket dhaatumal banakar baahar aa jaataa he - By reacting with the breath, it forms two types of oxides - jo ye darshata he ki phosphorus 3 or 5 donon prakaar kii sanyojaktaa rakhata he
 Similarly, it reacts with chlorine to form two types of chlorides - shwet phosphorus ko castic soda ke saath garm karne par phosphin gas utpann hoti he - 4P + 3naoh → 3nah2po2 + PH3 shwet phosphorus ko kisi andhere kamare main rakhane par isse nikalataa hua prakaash dekha ja saktaa he jo ki iske haule haule dahan ke falswaroop nikalataa he
 This property is called phosphorescence
 pehle jaanwaron kii asthiyon se phosphorus praapt kiya jaataa tha
 In this method, the fluid is filtered and evaporated after the gelatin-free or roasted bones are reacted with sulfuric acid in a large tank
 or jab is taral padaarth kaa aapekshik ghanatv 1
45 ho jaataa he, tab isamen 20% koyala yaa jala hua pathar kaa koyala milakar ise chhichley kadahon main garam kiya jaataa
 When it remains six percent humidity, then it is heated in a furnace so that it turns red by keeping it in closed mouth utensils
 is prakaar lagaataar teen chaar dinon tak garam karte rahane se vartmaan phosphorus asut hokar ek duusare bartan main pani main ekatra hota rahata he, jahaan se ise nikaalkar punarasuth kiya jaataa he, tab shuddh phosphorus miltaa he
 But this is a very painful method
 adhik laagat par bhi isamen phosphorus kii atyant alp prapti ho paati he; isliye ab vidyut bhattiyon evam vatya-bhattiyon kaa prayog hone laga he or phosphorus kaa vyapaarik nirmaan bhi sugam evam sast ho gaya he
 In this new system, a mixture of rocky phosphate, silica and carbon is melted in the furnace in a reducing atmosphere and then the phosphorus vapor is collected and converted into various types of compounds
 is vidhi main salphurik amla kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati, saath hi isse adhik phosphorus kii prapti bhi hoti he
 Phosphorus combines with oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, sulfur and metals to form oxide, hydroxide, chloride, sulfide and phosphide compounds, respectively
 oxidon ko pani main ghulaane se phosphorus ke amlon kii prapti hoti he
 Phosphorus pentoxide in oxides, phosphine in hydrides, phosphorus pentachloride in halides, phosphorus pentasulfides are of greater importance in sulfides
 phosphorus anek dhaatuon ke sanyog se phosphid banaata he, kintu gandhak kii apeksha dhaatuon ke liye isaki bandhuta kam he
 In phosphoid, tin and copper phosphides are formed only by the addition of these metals and phosphorus
 ye phosphid pani yaa amla ke saath kriya karke fosphin yaa phosphonium lavan banaate hai
 Phosphine is chemically similar to ammonia and, like ammonium hydroxide, phosphonium hydroxide is an alkali name
 phosphorus ke aath amla gyaat hai, jinamein se paanch to phosphorus oxide tathaa phosphorus pentoxide or jal ke sanyog se banate hai
 Their names are: Metaphosphorus, Phosphorus, Metaphosphoric, Pyrophosphoric, and Orthophosphoric Acid
 inke atirikt hypophosphorus, pirophosphorus tathaa hypophosphorus amla hai, jo phosphorus ke oxidon tathaa jal kii abhikriya se nahin praapt hote
 Of these eight acids, orthophosphoric acid is the most important, whose molecular formula, one of its two molecules, pyrophosphoric acid when water is lost, and one molecule of the same molecule are formed from water loss as metaphosphoric acid
 phosphoric amla trikshawraki hota he jiske kaaran teen prakaar ke lavan, praathmik, dwitiyak tathaa tritiyak, banate hai, jinhen phosphate kehete hai
 This acid is most commonly used in the manufacture of artificial fertilizers or fertilizers
 iske atirikt phosphorus anek yogic banaata he, jaise hypophosphet phosphet tathaa phosphoprotein aadi
 Red phosphorus is used in making matches and fireworks
 iske vifaille hone ke kaaran yah chuuhe maarane kii davaaiyon main bhi prayukt hota he
 Apart from this, it is also used in making phosphor brange, which is a useful alloy, and in the manufacture of many medicines

 unhone apane bare main swayan likhaa tha ki duniya main yun to bahut se achche kavi-shaayar hai, lekin unki style sabase niraali he: Although Ghalib did not receive formal education, he learned his lessons in Arabic, Persian, logic and philosophy from Mullah Abdusamad and grew himself on an intellectual level

 History and Contribution of Newspaper: Although a newspaper is considered as a beginning by a former officer of British rule, but its form was not like that of newspapers
 vah keval ek panne kaa suchanaatmak parchaa tha
 The Purnarupen newspaper was brought out of Bengal by Viceroy Hickey under the name of 'bengal-gazette'
 aarambh main angrejon ne apane phaayde ke liye akhabaaron kaa istemaal kiya, chunki saare akhbaar angreji main hi nikal rahe the, isliye bahusankhyak logon tak khabaren or suchnaayen pahunch nahin paati thim
 The news that came out and passed through the system, used to spread its terror there
 unke khilaaf na to mukademe hote or na hi unhen koi dand hi diya jaataa tha
 People were silent despite facing these hellish circumstances
 is dauraan bharat main ‘da hindustan times’, ‘neshnal herald', 'pyniyar', 'mumbai-mirar' jaise akhbaar angreji main nikalate the, jisamen un atyaacharon kaa dur-dur tak ullekh nahin rahata tha
 In addition to these English papers, letters were published in Bangla, Urdu etc
 but the scope was limited
 use koi bengali padhane vaala yaa urdu jaanane vaala hi samaj saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the first issue of Hindi's first letter 'udant Martand' was published on 30 May 1826
 yah patr saptahik tha
 The introduction of 'udant-martand' attempted to tie people together at the linguistic level
 yah keval ek patr nahin tha, balki un hajaaron logon kii jubaan tha, jo ab tak khamosh or bhaybheet the
 The introduction of letters in Hindi led to a revolutionary change in the country and the war of independence
 unhen kaaphi tod-marodakar prastut kiya jaataa tha, taaki angreji sarkaar ke atyaacharon kii khabaren dabi rah jaaen
 British soldiers entered any area and behaved arbitrarily
 lut, hatya, balaatkaar jaisi ghatnaayen aam hoti thim
 Whichever area he found a new direction
 ab logon tak desh ke kone-cone main ghat rahi ghatnaon kii jaankaree pahunchne lagi
 But shortly after, Jugal Kishore, the editor of this letter, had to close the letter on 11 December 1827 for lack of assistance
 10 may 1829 ko bengal se hindi akhbaar 'bangadoot' kaa prakaashan hua
 This letter also became the voice of the people and a medium to keep them connected
 iske baad july, 1854 main shyamsundar sen ne kalakatta se ‘samachar sudhaa varshan’ kaa prakaashan kiya
 During that time, any newspaper or newspaper published any news or article against the British Government, it had to pay its price
 akhabaaron ko pratibandhit kar diya jaataa tha
 Its copies were burnt, its publishers, editors, writers were punished
 un par baari-bharkam jurmaana lagaaya jaataa tha, taaki wo dubaara phir uthne kii himmat na juta paaen
 As the wave of independence was spreading across the country, newspapers were also becoming more and more tolerant of atrocities
 yahi vajah thi ki bengal vibhaajan ke uparaant hindi patron kii aawaaj or buland ho gai
 Lokmanya Tilak edited 'kesari' and Lala Lajpat Rai took out the letter 'vande Mataram' from Punjab
 in patron ne yuvaaon ko aazaadee kii ladaai main adhik-se-adhik sahyog dene kaa aahvaan kiya
 These letters created a passion for independence
 ‘kesari’ ko nagpur se madhavrao sapre ne nikaala, lekin tilak ke uttejk lekhon ke kaaran is patr par pabandi laga di gai
 Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi started publishing the weekly letter 'pratap' from Kanpur in 1913 to revive the freedom struggle in North India
 isamen desh ke har hisse main ho rahe atyaacharon ke bare main jaankariyaan prakashit hoti thim
 This triggered outrage among the people and they were even more excited to overthrow the British rule
 isaki aakraamakata ko dekhte hue angrej prashasan ne iske lekhakon, sampadakon ko tarah-tarah kii pratadnaayen deen, lekin yah patr apane lakshya par data rahaa
 Similarly, letters were being published from the areas of Bengal, Bihar and Maharashtra
 un patron ne logon main swatantraaa ko paane kii lalak or jaagrukta failaane kaa prayaas kiya
 If it is said that these newspapers were not inferior to any weapon for freedom fighters, then there would be no exaggeration
 akhbaar bane aazaadee kaa hathiyaar press aaj jitna swatantra or mukhar dikhataa he, aazaadee kii jang main yah utani hi bandishon or paabandiyon se bandhaa hua tha
 Neither was there a form of entertainment in it nor was it a source of income
 ye akhbaar or patr-patrikas aazaadee ke jaanbaajon kaa ek hathiyaar or madhyam the, jo unhen logon or ghatnaon se jode rakhata tha
 There was no such warrior of the freedom struggle, who did not try to speak through the newspapers
 gandhiji ne bhi ‘harijan’, ‘yang-india’ ke naam se akhabaaron kaa prakaashan kiya tha to moulana abul kalam aaazaad ne 'al-hilaal' patr kaa prakaashan
 There are many other examples that prove that newspapers and magazines had an important role in the freedom struggle
 yah vah daur tha, jab logon ke paas samvaad kaa koi saadhan nahin tha
 Even then, the helpless people who were victims of the atrocities of the British used to bear all the atrocities silently
 na to koi unki sunne vaala tha or na unke du:khon ko harne vaala
 Even if they used to say to whom and how? Everyone was facing the same torture
 aise main patr-patrikaon kii shuruyaat ne logon ko himmat di, unhen dhanjhas bandhaaya
 This was the reason that every article of the revolutionaries used to communicate new vigor and patriotism in the public
 bhaaratendu kaa naatak ‘bharat-durdasha’ jab prakashit hua tha to logon ko yah anubhav hua tha ki bharat ke log kaise daur se guzar rahe hai or angrejon kii manshaa kya he

 PK then finds his remote and returns to his home

 Natural scenery is the unambiguous features of any part of the land, including the physical elements of its natural forms, water bodies such as rivers, lakes and seas, the natural flora and fauna that live on the earth, including the useful man-made soil
 Buildings and structures including objects and temporary elements such as electrical systems and weather conditions
 The image of human culture, which takes millennia to form, both together reflect the local and national identity of both the people of any place and that place
 prakritik drishy, inaki visheshta or gunvattta, kisi kshetra kii aatm chhavi or, us sthaan kii bhaavnaatmak anubhutiyaan, jo ise duusare kshetron se alag karti he, ko paribhaashit karne main madad karti he
 It is the dynamic backdrop of people's lives
 prithvi par prakritik drishyon kaa ek vyapak vistaar he jisamen dhruviya kshetron ke barfile prakritik drishy, pahari prakritik drishy, vistrut marusthaleey prakritik drishy, dwipon or samudrataton caprakritik drishy, ghaney jangalon yaa pedo ke prakritik drishyon sahit puraane udichy van evam ushnkaribandheey varshaavan or shitoshna evam ushnkaribandheey kshetron ke krishi yogya prakritik drishy shaamil hai
 Natural scenery review further
 These terms refer to a system of man-made complexes on land - some premises such as demarcated fields, which however cannot be defined by enclosures or walls
 It can be called a natural unit, it refers to an area or part of land such as a valley of a river or ever occupied by tribals or later to a series of mountains under the dominion of sovereign feudal lords
 arth kii drushti se yah shabd german landshaft ke samatuly he jo choti prashasnic ikai yaa kshetra ko sanderbhit karata he
 The term later fell out of use, and the word did not appear in any Latin-language translation until the time of the Doomsday Book in the 11th century
 is shabd kaa aadhunik swarup apni drishyaatmak vyakhyaaon sahit 16veen shatabdi main saamne aayaa jab landscape shabd kaa parichay antardeshiy prakritik yaa gramin bhudrishy kii chitrakaariyon ke sandarbh main dach chitrakaaron dwaara karaayaa gaya
 Landscape was first recorded in 1598, derived from the Dutch language as a painter's term during the 16th century, when Dutch painters were in a position to master the field of landscape design
 pehle dach shabd landscap kaa matlab keval bhoomi kaa ek kshetra yaa hissaa tha lekin phir ise kalatmak bhav ke liye apana liya gaya, jise angreji main bhoomi par maujuud kisi drishyaatmak chitra kii vyakhya ke liye shaamil kiya gaya
 According to Jackson: "since 1577, with Harrison's interpretation of Britain, a new interpretation of the aesthetic nature of the landscape emerged as a new kind of topographical writing
 

"
 multah is shabd kaa landskip ke rup main anuwaad kiya gaya jise oxford english dictionari ne shabd kaa ek apbhransh swarup bataaya, phir dhire-dhire isaki jagah landscape ne le lee
 bhautikeey prakritik drishy ke liye angreji shabd ke upyog kaa zikr pehle kahin darj nahin he
 Focusing on an in-depth analysis on the German term Landshaft, one Richard Hartshorne defined landscape as "an outer, visible surface of the Earth
" yah sataha un bahari satahon se nirmit he jo vaataavaran, vanaspatiyon, banjar bhoomi, barf, yaa jaleey jeevon yaa maanav nirmit suvidhaon ke tatkaal sampark main aati he
 Hartshorne kept the term separate from the region which in his understanding is of a larger and flexible shape
 unhone akaash ko is aadhaar par hataa diya kyonki vayumandal keval maatr vah madhyam he jiske jariye prithvi kii sataha ko dekha jaataa he or isamen bhumigat khanij utpaadan kaary, wanon ke neeche kii mitti or varsha shaamil nahin he
 However, he included the moving objects with the comment that a view of Broadway is incomplete without its traffic
 unhone prakritik drishy main mahasaagaron ko shaamil kiye jane ko nazarandaaj kar diya
 unhone drishyon ke atirikt prakritik drishyon kii vyakhya, jaise us bhoomi par aawaaj or gandh, kaa virodh kiya kyonki ye sabhi kisi ekikrut avadharana ko spasht nahin karte
 prakritik or saanskrithik mahatv vaale prakritik drishyon kii avadharana ke sandarbh main karl saura ne dusron se alag dharna rakhi, unhone kaha "jaise hi drishy main insaan kii maujuudagi hoti he, prakritik drishy kaa swaabhaavik astitv samaapt ho jaataa he"
 primeval landscape shabd kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki jab iskaa arth maanav-purv kaa prakritik drishy ho saktaa he to varttman natural landscape kaa arth he "ek aisi saidhantik pariklpana jo kabhi maujuud nahin thi"
 During the 1920s and 1930s, such practices were developed that made landscape a mandatory, if not exclusive, feature of geography
 saura ke nazariye se yah vyakhya nikali ki bhugol kii bhoomika "prakritik drishy kii saiddhanthikta" kii silsilewar jaanch thi
 Solar viewed natural scenes broadly as areas that are a distinct group of both physical and natural forms, and called the study of landscape to evolve from natural landscapes to natural scenes of cultural significance
 1940 ke dashak se, is avadharana ko maan kar paarit kar diya gaya tha kyonki bhautikvettaon ne paaya ki ateet kii punarrachana ke saath judi kathinaaiyaan bhayaavah hai or vartmaan duniya ke saath unki praathmik chintaa ko darshaati he
 With the knowledge of human impact on the environment, the concept of natural landscape was increasingly questioned
 Physicists of recent times have explained the subjective characteristics of a place within human geography and thus crossed the bridge between objective and subjective assessment of a region
 shabdkoshon main bataayi gayi prakritik drishy kii lokapriy dharna ek vishesh or saamaanya arth detii he; prithvi kii sataha ke kisi kshetra kaa vishesh sandarbh or saamaanya arth he vah cheez jise kisi prekshak dwaara dekha ja sake
 With more and more attention given to the understanding of the environment by psychologists in recent decades, the landscape is seen as the raw material from which to study human perceptions and human information systems
 is prakaar danniel or cosgrove ne landscape ko ek bhautik shabdaawalee ke rup main nahin balki maanviya dharna kii saarvajanik abhivyakti ke rup main is prakaar paribhaashit kiya: "prakritik drishy ek saanskrithik chhavi he or aasapaas kii chizon ke pratinidhitiv, sanrachanaatmakataa yaa sanketan kaa ek sachitr madhyam he
 "meinig looked at both psychological and physical aspects jointly:" Any natural view is not only the thing in front of our eyes, but also that which is present inside our brain
 
 In recent decades, the use of the term environment has increased considerably
 je aplyton ne paryaavaran ko prakritik drishy se yah kehete hue alag rakhaa ki prakritik drishy "ek janaa-pahachaanaa parivesh" he
 As Borassa noted, one advantage of the term environment rather than landscape is that the environment can be understood better than urban scenes, although the term urban landscape is also commonly used
 chunki paryaavaran shabd kisi kshetra vishesh ke sampurna bhautik, jaivik, saanskrithik or saundarya ke ghatakon ko apane andar samahit kiye he, aam taur par ise atyant vyapak or prakritik drishy ke liye ek daayre ke andar kaa shabd samajha jaataa he
 Words such as scene, scene and scenery do not provide an accurate interpretation of the landscape
 theatre main is shabd ke mul ko dekhen, jahaan seen kaa matlab he kisi naatak kaa ek hissaa, is prakaar seen kisi prakritik drishy kaa ek hissaa ho saktaa he
 Scenery, which reflects a decorative backdrop suitable on a stage, as well as the general appearance of a place, especially a pictorial reference
 haalanki prakritik drishy ke saath iskaa upyog ek duusare ke sthaan par kiya ja saktaa he lekin yah arth kii usee gaharaai ko vyakt nahin karata he
 The term natural visual aesthetics or just aesthetics is often used in literature
 prakritik drishy kii tulana main saundarya shaastra kaa mul kahin adhik vivaadaaspad he
 It is derived from the Greek word esthesis, meaning "emotional understanding
" The term was used as the title of Aesthetica by Alexander Baumgarten, a young German philosopher who incorrectly used this Greek word as a critique of beauty or a theory of taste
 is prakaar jo shabd vastav main bhaavnaatmak samaj ke vistrut kshetra par lagu hota he, use swaad ke kshetra tak hi simit kar diya gaya tha
 Emmanuel Cant criticized this usage in 1781 and used it as its best meaning "philosophy of Emotional Understanding"
 However, after 1830, the faux esthetics gained popularity as soon as they entered England and the Oxford English Dictionary According, within a century after Baumgarten's new interpretation of its meaning, it was widely used throughout Europe
 saundarya shaastra kii dictionari vyakhya baumgarton kii truti ko dur karti he or ise "sochane yogya yaa abhautik chizon kii bajaae indriyon dwaara samajhi jane vaali chijen", "sundarata kii anubhuti se sambandhit yaa saundarya shaastra kaa vigyaan" maikeri dictionari, 1981
, yaa "saundarya shaastra athwa sundarata ke arth main yaa isse sambandhit" chizon ke rup main paribhaashit karti he"
 saundarya shaastra ko darshanashastra kii ek aisi shakha ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jo "prakruti or swaad se kala ke niyamon evam siddhanton, lalit kala ke siddhant kaa pataa lagaataa he; saundarya vigyaan 


" athwa " saundarya kii prakruti ke saath or saundarya sambandhi nirnyon ke saath upyog main aata he"
 Thus the natural scene has often been a subject of curiosity within the broader framework of aesthetics in erasing an eagerness to an understanding of beauty
