 epistasis yaa prabalata vah ghatana he jisamen ek jin ke prabhaavon ko ek yaa kai anya jeenon ke dwaara sanshodhit kiya jaataa he, jinhen kabhi-kabhi sanshodhak jin bhi kaha jaataa he
 The gene whose expression is expressed is called epistatic, while the gene that is characterized or not expressed is called hypostatic
 epistatis prabhavita ke vipareet he, jo samaan jin locas main alilon ke bich ek antarkriya he
 Epistasis is often studied in relation to quantitative trait loci) and polygenic genetics
 saamaanya rup main, ek elil kii fitness kaa badhanaa ek jatil tareeke se kai anya alilon par nirbhar karata he; parantu, kyonki jis tareeke se jansankhya anuvanshiki vigyaan kaa vikaas hua, vikasvaadi vaigyanik epistasis ko niyamon main ek apwaad maanate hai
 According to the early model of natural selection developed in the early 20th century, each gene makes its characteristic contribution to fitness, in contrast to the average background of other genes
 kuch shuruuaati mahavidhyalayon ke paathyakram main jansankhya anuvaanshiki ko aaj bhi isi tareeke se padhaayaa jaataa he
 Epistasis and genetic interactions are different aspects of this phenomenon
 shabd epistasis kaa upyog bade paimaane par jansankhya anuvaanshiki main kiya jaataa he or yah vishesh rup se is ghatana ke sankhyikeey gundharmon se sambandhit he
 This certainly does not apply to biochemical interactions between gene products
 However, epistasis in general is used to denote the departure from 'freedom' of the effects of various genetic loci
 jeev vigyaan kii bhinn shakhaon ke bich 'swatantrata' ke bhinn vyakhyanon ke kaaran aksar bhram utpann hota he
 For a discussion of the definitions of epistasis and the history of these definitions, see
 fitness par epistatic prabhaav daalane vaale jin jo bahut najdiki se ek duusare se jude hai, ke udhaaharan superjin or maanav pramukh utak anuroop jatil jeenon main dekhne ko milte hai
 This effect arises directly at the genomic level, where one gene can code for protein inhibition transcription of another gene
 vaikalpik rup se, yah prabhaav lakshan praaroop str par bhi utpann ho saktaa he
 For example, the colorless gene will hide the effects of the genes that control a person's hair color
 In another example, the effect of a gene coding the peak of a window will be hidden by the gene causing baldness
 Fitness epistasis is a cause of linkage imbalance
 anuvanshik antarkriya kaa adhyayan jin ke kaary, utparivartanon kii prakruti, kaaryaatmak atirek or protein antarkriya ko prakat kar saktaa he
 Because protein complexes are responsible for most biological functions, genetic interaction is a powerful tool

 In a haploid organism with the genotype AB, Ab, ab or ab, we can consider the value of the following properties where higher values indicate greater expression of characteristic properties: isliye, ham ise is prakaar se vargeekrut kar sakate hai: Understanding whether most genetic interactions are cooperative or antagonistic will help solve problems such as the development of sex
 nakaaratmak epistasis or sex ko ek duusare se sambandhit mana jaataa he
 Experimentally, this idea has been tested using digital simulations of asexual and sexual populations
 samay ke saath, langik jansankhya nakaaratmak epistasis kii ore ja rahi he, yaa aisa kaha ja saktaa he ki do antarkriya alilon ke dwaara fitness kam ho rahi he
 It is believed that negative epistasis results in mutation deleting mutations in people, effectively removing them from the population
 isse jansankhya main ye elil nahin rahete hai, parinamswaroop samgr jansankhya adhik feet ho jaati he
 This hypothesis was given by Alexe Kondrashov and is sometimes called the deterministic mutation hypothesis
 or iskaa pareekshan kritrim jin network kaa upyog karke bhi kiya gaya he
 However, evidence for this hypothesis has not always been directly forthcoming and the model proposed by Kondrashov has been criticized because it considers mutation parameters to be different from real-world observations

 Demons, demons and demons are getting uplifted and you people are getting downgraded

 "according to the Lord's order, Indra told Bali about the elimination of nectar from the churning of the sea
 daityaraj bali ne devraj indra se samjhauta kar liya or samudr manthan ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 The Mandarachal mountain was made a churner and Vasuki Nag a neti

 Come on! You are welcome

 Vishnu as Vishnu Mohini said, "O gods and demons!" Due to being the son of Maharishi Kashyap ji, both of you are brother and brother, yet you fight with each other
 main to swechhacharini stri hoon
 Wise people never believe such a woman, then how are you believing in me? It is good that you all join yourself and take Amritpan
 " On hearing such proverbial words of Vishwamohini, those humble demons, demons and asuras became even more confident in him
 ve bole, "sundari! ham tum par purna vishwaas he
 We will consume Amritpan in the same way you will share
 tum ye ghat le lo or ham sabhi main amrit vitaran karo
 "vishwamohini took the nectar and asked the gods and the demons to sit in separate rows
 uske baad daityon ko apane kataaksh se madahosh karte huye devataaon ko amritpan karaane lage
 The demons became so obsessed with their sarcasm that they forgot to drink nectar
 bhagwaan kii is chaal ko rahu naamak daitya samaj gaya
 He sat down among the gods after making the form of a deity and put the received nectar in the mouth
 jab amrit uske kanth main pahunch gaya tab chandramaa tathaa surya ne pukaar kar kaha ki ye rahu daitya he
 Hearing this, Lord Vishnu immediately separated his head from the neck with his Sudarshan Chakra
 amrit ke prabhaav se uske sir or dhad rahu or ketu naam ke do grah ban kar antariksh main sthapit ho gayi
 He is the one who gets the sun and the moon due to hatred

 janatantr par taanaashaahee kaa bada hi democratic waar tha ye
 chune hue netaa ko naapsandgi kii vajah se pad se hatana padaa
 chandrabhanu teen baar uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahe the
 1960 se 1963 tak to rahe hi
 par mukhyamantri pad chhodane ke baad bhi raajnneeti main unka prabhaav bana rahaa
 kismat kii baat

 lekin is baar sirf 19 dinon ke liye

 kareeb ek saal tak is pad par bane rahe
 tabhi kuch aisa hua jisane congress ko hameshaa ke liye badal diya

 Based on the moderate to political expansion of strong and extensive alliances with other parties, the BJP and its allies continued to grow in the 1991, 1996 and 1998 elections; And due to territorial expansion, the NDA became competitive and even got the highest number of votes in Congress-dominated areas like Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Assam

 There is also a general perception that as soon as the BJP began to believe that the elections were not entirely in its favor, it shifted the focus of the bjp's campaign from India Shining to issues of stability

 Search system optimization or search engine optimization is a type of process
 jisase koi apane jalsthal ko khoj pranali ke liye anukool karata he
 If it is well optimized then the expenditure incurred in advertising etc
 uski aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 There is always an effort by the user to optimize it well
 lekin har khoj seva pradaan karne vaali company kaa apana alag tarika hota he, jisase vah kisi prishth ko apane liye acha sochati he yaa keval anukulit vaala prishth samaj kar use nahin dekhati he
 Around 1990 there was a need for optimization like search system optimization
 tab is prakaar ke khoj pranali kii shuruyaat ho rahi thi
 After sending it to the website address of the website, it appeared in a search system
 lekin uske khoj pranali anukulan ke kaaran vah adhik upar dikhataa tha
 For this search system optimization, many website owners used different methods in trying to show their website above
 yah tarika mukhyatah do tarah ke hote the
 One was known as white cap and the other as black hat
 isamen safet topi kanoonee rup se sahi anukulan hota tha
 While the black hat adaptation was well overpowered for some time
 lekin us company ko is bare main pataa lagane par vah tarika phir kaam nahin karata tha
 Some people started taking it as a business and also opened a company for it
 1997 tak, khoj ingine dizinron ne yah maan liya kiya ki webmasters apane khoj ingine main acchhee shrenee karne ke prayaas kar rahe the, or yah ki kuch khoj pranali visheshgy bhi atyadhik yaa apraasangik khojashabdon vaale prishthon ko bharkar khoj parinaamon main apni ranking main herpher kar rahe the
 Early search engines, adjusted their algorithm in an effort to prevent webmasters from manipulating the category
 1998 main do chatro ne bakerab naamak ek khoj pranali banaai jo prishth ke paaydaan ke anuroop kaary karti thi
 Later in 1998, he formed a company called Google which provides services like search system
 shuru main yah keval kuch hi jalsthal ke pate ko rakhti thi
 But when it reached the people, many people should create various ways to further their website in it
 isamen anek sthanon par kadi jodna yaa kisi anuprayog ke dwaara swatah hi kadi bananaa aadi tha
 At first this action started working, but later after changing it, the place used to remain on doing this action
 vah bhi or neeche chale jaataa tha
 a
 sarvapratham kisi bhi nai jalsthal ko or usase jude prishthon, jise aap is khoj parinaam main dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 Send them
 is prakriya main kuch ghanton se lekar kuch dinon kaa samay lag jaataa he
 Many new addresses take this time of one week
 jiske baad yah prakriya dhire dhire tej hone lagati he
 If your optimization is done correctly, you will see a bot size of the search system as you create a page and save it in your information
 iske baad koi bhi us samay us paathya ko khoj kar jaankaree praapt kar saktaa he
 There are many pages that contain account creation, or any other information that you do not want to appear in the search
 kai baar koi taatkaalik rup se bane prishth bhi khoj parinaam main dikhne lagate hai
 So any search system will consider your website as spam
 isse parinaam kaa sthaan neeche ho jayega
 For this reason, pages appearing for some time should be protected from being tested by the search system
 mul rup se sahi anukulan keval use hi kaha jaataa he, jab aap jalsthal ko keval prayokta ke drushtikon se banaaen
 In which there is no advertisement of any kind or any external links
 yah kisi ke dwaara padhane ke liye upyukt ho
 On page SEO includes everything that affects your website
 Like all technical aspects that affect the ranking of search engines on your website
 This includes the structure of your website, the loading speed of the site and the content lying on the website which plays an important role in the ranking
 SEO kaa aglaa pahalu he of pej SEO, jo SEO kii duniya main thoda muskill kaha jaataa he
 of pej SEO ke bare main sidhe shabdon main kahen to ye aapaki website ke link he jo duusari hai athurity website par riference kii tarah padi hai
 jitani Quality vaali website par aapke link honge utani hi acchhee aapaki website kii search ingine par ranking hogi
 Whereas the next off-page SEO factor is Niche or competition which is from the content on another website
 So this means that the less competition you have a niche, the better chance you will get of good rank
 aaj ke samay main SEO karnaa thodaa mushkil ho gaya he to iske liye aap ko on pej seo or of pej seo donon ke bare main pure vistaar se jaan kar hi kar sakate he

 The HSE continued to allow scaffolding according to BS 5973 until the release of the revised TG20
 mul saamagree tubs, caplers or board hai
 Taps are of steel or aluminum, although composite scaffolding uses filament wound tubes of glass fiber in nylon or polyester molds

 Wooden scaffolding boards in the UK are required to conform to the requirements of BS 2482
 saath hi lakdi, steel yaa aluminium kii chat yaa leminute bordon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Also, the boards used for the working platform are solitary or sole boards that are placed under the scaffold when the surface is soft or otherwise suspected, although ordinary boards can also be used, another called scaffpad
 The design is used as another solution, it is made of rubber base with a base plate mold inside, it is very effective on uneven ground Are, because they seem to cost more money to replace the sole boards adopt any size surface
 caplers fittings jo naliyon ko ek saath pakad kar rakhte hai
 The most common of these are called scaffolding couplers, they are basically of three types: right-angle couplers, putlog couplers and swivel couplers
 Joint pins or sleeve couplers from one end to the other end or both together are used to connect the tubes
 ek 'bhaar sahane vaale jod' main naliyon ko lagane ke liye keval rhite-angel caplers or swivel caplers kaa hi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Single couplers are not load carrying couplers and do not have any design capability
 anya aam samagriyon main base plate, seedhi, rassiyaan, ankar tise, rivil tise, jin hvilz, sheeting ityadi shaamil hai
 Despite scaffolding, many scaffold tubes and boards have been measured in imperial units
 21 feet neeche se naliyon or 13 foot neeche se bordon ke saath
 The main elements of a scaffold are standards, lasers and cross beams
 Standards, also called pillars, are straight vertical pipes that carry the entire weight of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread their load
 base plate ke centre main nalee ko thaamne ke liye ek shank hota he or kabhi-kabhi yah ek ekal board se judaa hota he
 Lasers are horizontal pipes that connect between standards
 trensms sam kone par legers par tike hote hai
 The main transoms are placed next to the standards, they hold the standards in place and support the boards, the intermediate transoms are those that are placed between the main transoms to provide additional support to the boards
 canada main is style ko "angreji" ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he
 In the "american" style, transoms are associated with standards and are underutilized but have special advantages in some situations
 chunki machaan ek bhautik sanrachana he, isliye machaan ke andar janaa or baahar aana sambhav he
 Also, the tubes of even angles are obstructed to increase their hardness, from which they are placed diagonally from laser to laser, following the standard on which they are mounted
 agar bracis legers par lage hote hai to unhen lager bracis kaha jaataa he
 The scaffolding has Fasad braces at an angle of 35 ° –55 ° at every level from 30 meters or so from the base of the scaffold to the top to limit flexibility
 pehle ullikhit caplers ke sam-kone caplers legers yaa trensms ko standerds, putalang se yaa single caplers board bearing trensms ko legers se jodate hai- non-board bearing trensms ko sam koniya caplers se lagaaya jaataa he
 Swivel couplers connect tubes at any other angle
 vaastavik jodon ko aas-paas ke standerds main ek hi str par hone se bachaane ke liye kuch idhar-udhar kar diya jaataa he
 The spacing of basic elements in the scaffold is fairly standard
 ek saamaanya prayojan ke machaan ke liye kaksh kii adhiktam lambaai 2

7 meter kii chaudaai ke kaksh kii anumati di gayi he
 The width of the scaffold is determined by the width of the boards, the minimum width being 600 mm
 Is permitted but a more specific four-board scaffolding will be 870 mm wide from Standard to Standard
 More heavy work scaffolding may require a width of 5, 6 or even 8 boards
 antareey standard or sanrachana ke bich kii khuli jagah ko kaam karne ke liye aksar ek antareey board joda jaataa he
 The lift height, the difference between the ledgers, is 2 meters, although the base lift is 2
7 meters
 Can also be done
 upar kii akruti bhi ek kikar lift darshaati he, jo jameen se maatr 150 mimi yaa itani hi upar he
 The distance of the transom is determined by the thickness of the supporting boards, 1
2 m for the 38 mm board
 a distance of not more than 100 mm is required whereas a board of 50 mm can stand at a distance of 2
6 m and boards of 63 mm can have a maximum spread of 3
25 m
 sabhi bordon ke liye nunatam chazza 50 mimi he or adhiktam chazza board kii motaai ke chaar gune se adhik nahin hoti he
 Good foundations are necessary
 aksar machaan ke dhaanche ko surakshit parivahan or bhaar ke failaav yaa vitaran ke liye saadhaaran base plate se adhik kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Scaffolding can also be used on concrete or similar hard surfaces without a base plate, although a base plate is always recommended
 footpath yaa pakki sadak jaisi satahon ke liye base platen aavashyak hai
 For softer or more suspicious surfaces single boards must be used, at least 220 mm below a single standard
 a single board of minimum 1,000 cm2 with dimensions must be used, thickness at least 35 mm
 Should be Heavy scaffolding may require a more concrete timber set in concrete
 asamtal bhoomi par base plate ke liye sidhiyaan avashya kaati jaani chahie, ek nunatam seedhi ke liye lagbhag 450 mimi

 Scaffolds are seldom independent structures
 machaan ko sthirataa pradaan karne ke liye dhaanche ke bandhanon ko aam taur par nikatavarti imaarat / kapade / lohe kii chizon se baandh diya jaataa he
 It is common practice to attach a knot every 4 m in optional lifts, structural connections on all planks in prefabricated system scaffolds - ie 2-3 m
 The center is required
 The knot on the scaffold is connected as close as possible to the junction of standards and ledgers
 haal ke niyam parivartan kii vajah se machaan kii ganth ko + / - bhaar or parshv bhaar kaa samarthan karnaa aavashyak he
 Due to the different nature of the structures, different types of knots are available to take advantage of the opportunities
 purna ganthon ko sanrachana kii khidakiyon jaisi khuli jagahon ke madhyam se daalaa jaataa he
 Inside the tube crossing, a perpendicular open end is connected by the transom to the scaffold and the outer crossing horizontal tube called the bridal tubes
 naliyon or sanrachana kii satahon ke bich ke antaraal ko lakdi ke virgon se bhar kar yaa atka kar ek thos aadhaar sunishchit kiya jaataa he
 Box knots are used to tie the scaffold to appropriate columns or comparable shapes
 akruti ke donon taraf lift se do atirikt trensm daale jate hai or unhen donon taraf taai tub naamak choti naliyon ke saath jod diya jaataa he
 When a full box tie is impossible, an L-shaped lip tie can be used to attach the scaffold to the structure, an extra transom from the stiffness on the outside of the structure, butt to limit movement inward
 Transom is applied
 kabhi-kabhi ankar taai kaa upyog karnaa bhi sambhav he, ye sanrachana main banaaye gaye chhedon main lage jane vaali ganthen hai

 Reveal tubes are usually held in place by a screw pin and protective packing at each end
 ek trensm taai tub rivil tub ko machaan se jodti he
 Reveal ties are not considered good, they are short on friction and require regular testing, so it is not recommended that more than half of all knots have a tie
 yadi gantha kii surakshit sankhya kaa prayog karnaa sambhav na ho to recors kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 These are combined and well-established single tubes of laser exiting the scaffold at an angle of at least 75 °
 iske baad aadhaar par ek trensm mukhya machaan ke aadhaar par ek trikon peeth ko puraa karata he
 Putlog couplers are also accompanied by putlog tubes, their ends are flattened or a blade is attached
 yah akruti nalee ke sire ko sanrachana ke eent ke kaary ke andar yaa uske upar tikaane main sahaayta karti he
 They can be called scaffolds with a brick surface and consist of only one row of normals with single lasers, the putlogs being transoms — which are laser-connected at one end but integrated into the bricks at the other end
