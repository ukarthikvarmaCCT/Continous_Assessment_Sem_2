 If the cause cannot be determined with sufficient certainty, a biopsy will be recommended

 Although mammography is the only method for breast cancer screening that can save lives, it is not accurate
 mammography dwaara pahchaan se batch nikle cancer rogiyon kii sankhya aamtaur par 10% se 30% he
 This means that out of 350 women in whom breast cancer is found per 1 xxrep 5 0 women, about 35 to 105 could not detect cancer by mammography
 Reasons for the cancer not being detected include the observer's omission, but it happens multiple times that breast cancer lurks in the other dense tissue of the breast and is not visible even after retrospective review of mammograms
 In addition, one form of breast cancer is the development of lobular cancer, which casts a shadow on mammograms, and it is not possible to separate them from normal breast tissue

 Of the 227 cancer patients detected, out of 199 cases of cancer diagnosed by two different physicians, the number of patients diagnosed by CAD method was just one less
 acha The goal of any screening procedure is to examine a large number of patients and to detect patients with potentially serious conditions
 in rogiyon ko aage ke aamtaur par adhik tivrata vaale pareekshan ke liye bheja jaataa he
 Thus, the purpose of screening test is not conclusive, but its purpose is high sensitivity, so that there is no mistake in detecting any cancer
 This high sensitivity results in relatively large numbers of outcomes, causing patients without the disease to be regarded as suspect
 yahi mammography kaa sach he
 Sometimes patients are called back for a further test after a screening session, sometimes referred to as "false positives" and a faulty signal
 vastav main, yah kai swasth marijon ko aage kii jaanch ke liye isliye bulaanaa aavashyak he, taaki jitna sambhav ho sake cancer ke rogiyon kaa pataa lagaaya sake

 However, some women who get false positive results may have anxiety, discomfort and sadness about the possibility of getting breast cancer and such a feeling can last for many years

 This is quite difficult in practice, as many women do not regularly return for mammography, which makes it difficult to find out if they had cancer
 Dr
 Samuel S
 Iptin, in his book The Politics of Cancer, has claimed that one out of four women in every mammography in women aged 40 to 49 failed to detect cancer
 Researchers have found that breast tissue is quite dense in young women and lumps are difficult to detect
 is kaaran se, rajonivritti se pehle karaaye gayi stan chithran main galat nakaaratmak report do baar tak ho sakati he
 This is why in the UK, screening programs do not start calling women for screening programs until the age of 50

 Research on the related condition shows that even small cancers, which were not immediately started with diagnostic work, but monitored for a period of several years, showed good results
 a group of 3184 women was mammogramed, who were formally classified as "potentially early"
 rogiyon kaa yah vargeekaran spasht rup se saamaanya nahin hai, lekin isamen maamuli chintaa ke kuch kshetra shaamil hai
 In these results, the patients were not biopsied, but the results of mammography were monitored every six months for three years, so that no changes could be guaranteed
 Of these 3184 women, 17 had cancer

 The majority of health experts believe that the risk of breast cancer for low-risk women under the age of 35 is not so high that they have to bear the risk of the potential ill effects of radiation
 For this reason and in women younger than 35, the radiation sensitivity of the breast is probably higher than in older women, so most radiologists do not perform mammography in women under 40
 However, if there is a significant risk of cancer in a particular patient, then mammography may still be important
 aksar, radiologist ultrasound yaa emarai imaging kaa upyog karke mammography se bachane kii koshish karte hai
 Statistics regarding mammography and women between the ages of 40 and 55 have been the most controversial
 1992 main canada ke rashtriya stan cancer adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki mammography 50 se 60 umr kii mahilaon kii mrityu dar par sakaaratmak prabhaav nahin tha
 This study, however, was done only to achieve this result
 adhyayan ke aalochakon ne kaha ki isamen bahut hi gambhir prakaar kii khamiyaan thim, jinase ye parinaam galat sabit hue
 There is also evidence that clearly shows that during the screening of women, excessive exercise was done to identify cancer
 is tarah ke cancer in mahilaon ko unke puure jeevankaal main kabhi prabhavit nahin karte
 jab 2000 mahilaon ko 10 saal kii naidanik prakriya se guzarana padaa to unamem se 10 main stan cancer ke nidaan ke liye jarurat se zyada naidanik prakriya apanaai gai or jaan bachaane ke liye anaavashyak chikitsa kii gai
 Although screening of women between 40 and 50 is still controversial, the number of evidence indicates that it has little benefit in the early detection of the disease
 vartmaan main, american cancer sosayadi, neshnal cancer insticute or american college of radiology 40 se 49 varsh kii umr kii mahilaon ko har 2 saal par memmography ke liye protsaahit karte hai
 Conversely, the American College of Physicians, a large group of physicians, recently encouraged individual screening schemes, in contrast to screening women aged 40 to 49 every two years at wholesale prices
 haal hi main america priventive sarvice task force ne kaha ki 40 se 50 varsh kii mahilaon ke liye niyamit jaanch karana aavashyak nahin he
 Their report states that the benefits of testing before the age of 50 are not more important than the risks

 Critics say a large number of women need to be screened to detect cancer

 Keane & Keane indicated that repeated mammography from the beginning of the age of 50 was successful in saving the lives of 1
8 out of 1000 women examined for 15 years
 This result should be seen against negative errors in diagnosis, over-treatment and exposure to radiation
 Critics argue that its benefits are greater
 screening ke kocharen vishleshan se sanket miltaa he ki yah "spasht nahin he ki screening se nuksaan kii tulana main zyada phayda hota he
 "according to their analysis, one in 2000 women will have a life of 10 years longer due to screening, however another 10 healthy women will unnecessarily undergo breast cancer treatment
 Newman points out that screening of mammography does not reduce mortality overall, but Fearing cancer causes significant damage and unnecessary surgical interventions

 prithvi ke sataha ke nikat kisi pind ke ikai dravyaman par lagane vaala prithvi kaa gurutvkarshan bal prithvi kaa gurutv kehalaata he
 It is denoted as g
 yadi koi pind dharti ke sataha ke nikat gurutvakaran bal ke atiririkt kisi anya bal kii anupasthiti main swatantra rup se gati kar rahi ho to uskaa twaran g ke baraabar hoga
 Its value is about 9
81 m / s2
 g kaa maan prithvi ke vibhinn sthanon par bhinn-bhinn hota he
 g can also be understood as acceleration
 yadi koi pind prithvi se upar le jaakar choda jaay or us par kisi prakaar kaa anya bal kaary na kare to vah sidhaa prithvi kii ore girtaa he or uskaa veg ek niyat kram se badhata jaataa he
 In this way, the acceleration or acceleration produced in a body due to the attraction force of the Earth is called gravity acceleration
 ise angreji akshar g dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he
 It has been said above that it is also called the intensity of gravity at some place
 gurutvajanit twaran arthath g kaa maan prithvi ke centre se duuri ke anusaar ghatata badhata he, arthath is duuri ke badhane par yah ghatata he or duuri ghatane par badhata he
 Therefore, its value is higher on the sea level and less on the mountains
 isi prakaar bumadhya rekha par iskaa maan dhruvon kii apeksha kam hota he, kyonki prithvi dhruvon par kuch chipti he jiske kaaran prithvi ke centre se dhruvon kii duuri bumadhyarekha kii apeksha kam he
 The value of g0 on the seabed can be obtained by the following formula: g0 = 978
049 Cm Per cent Per se 
; Where f is the latitude of that place
 yadi koi sthaan samudratal se h oonchaai par ho to vahaan g kaa maan arthath g h
 nikatatam maan tak nimnlikhit sutara dwaara gyaat kiya ja saktaa he: Generally, the value of g on the earth is 978 and 983
2 cm / sec according to latitudes
 Sec Or 32
09 and 32
26 ft / sec
 Sec Lives between ye maan samudratalon par hote hai
 The methods of finding the value of g can be divided into two categories: pratyaksh vidhi or Oscillator method
 is vidhi main kisi pind ko nishchit oonchaai se giraaya jaataa he or samaan avadhi main uske dwaara paar kii hui dooriyaan naap lee jaati hai
 From this, the value of g is calculated
 is vidhi kaa prayog atwood kii mashin main kiya jaataa he
 It consists of two entities m1 and m2 with very subtle differences, joined by a hinge which passes over a pulley
 yadi m2 apekshaakrit baari ho to yah neeche utarane lagegi or m1 upar chadhne lagegi
 If s is taxed at a distance, its velocity becomes v and acceleration is f, according to Newton's dynamics v^2 = 2 f s The value of acceleration f can be determined by the following formula: f = m1 + m2 g r^2 / r^2) Here, the position of the pulley around the center is rotating and r is the radius of the pulley
 at: is vidhi main ghirani ke gharshan tathaa vaayu ke pratirodh ityadi kaa koi vichaar nahin kiya jaataa, isaliye iske dwaara praapt g ke maan main paryaapt truti rahati he
 Due to these reasons this method is not generally followed
 is vidhi main ek lolak ko uski madhyamaan sthiti ke donon ore dolan karakar aavartkaal t gyaat kiya jaataa he
 If the distance from the point of suspension to the gravity center of the pendulum is taken and it is assumed that the entire weight of the pendulum is condensed at its gravity center, then oscillation time t and acceleration of gravity g are interrelated by the following formula: t = 2 p ÖI / g Or, g = 4p 2 i / T2 is vidhi main yah dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki lolak kaa dolan vistaar yaa aayam 40 se adhik na ho, anyathaa sutara main nimnlikhit sanshodhan karnaa padegaa : t = 2 Ö1 / g yahan q aayam hai
 To determine the more accurate value of g, a rigid body is taken as a pendulum that oscillates on the horizontal base
 yadi gurutvakentre se kshurdhar kii duuri i ho or k uske gurutvakentre se hokar janevaali tathaa kshurdhar ke samaantar aksh ke chaaron ore vighurnan trigya ho to sutara g = 4 p 2 / IT ^ 2 dwaara g kaa maan adhik thik thik gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Such pendulum is called compound pendulum
 yadi yogic lolak main i ke bhinn-bhinn maanon ke liye aavartkaal t ke paath liye jaayan tathaa i or t ke bich ek lekhachitr praapt kiya jaay to lolak ke sire se naapane par lambaai kaa maan jyon jyon badhata he, dolankaal ghatata jaataa he, kintu nunatam maan na tak pahunchne ke uparaant pun: badhane lagata he 
 After reaching near the midpoint of the pendulum, the oscillation period moves rapidly towards infinity
 cater ne g kaa adhik sateek maan gyaat karne ke liye aisa lolak liya jo chad ke rup main tha or jiske madhyabindu ke donon ore ek kshurdhar tha
 The period of lalak was the same when hung from both the bases
 isi chad main asmaan sanhatiwaale do dhaatukhand bhi lage the
 The code of one was much higher than the other
 baari sanhati ko samanjit karke donon kshurdhaaron par lolak ke aavartkaal lagbhag samaan kiye ja sakate the or halaki sanhati ko samanjit karke donon aavartakaalon ke bich ke antar ko or bhi kam kiya ja saktaa tha
 If T1 and T2 are periodic when oscillating with both bases respectively and I1 and I2 are distances from the gravity center of the rod of those bases then according to Basel 4 p 2 / g = T12+T22 / I1+I2 + T12-T22 / I1-I2 In this, I1 + I2 can be measured exactly and the last term is very subtle due to the fact
 at: yah sutara g kaa thik thik maan de saktaa he
 The following precautions should be taken while using: aayam yaa dolanvistaar kam ho, Resistance to air and friction of air should try to keep the pendulum speed as low as possible, lolak kaa aalamb aisa chunanaa chahie ki vah lolak ke bhaar ke kaaran lachak na jaae tathaa Do not change the temperature of the room more throughout the duration of the experiment, otherwise there will be a difference in length i due to diffusion of pendulum

 hastrekha shaastra yaa kirmancy "haath" or mantia se bana he) hatheli ko padhakar lakshan kaa varnan or bhavishya bataane kii kala he jise hastrekha adhyayan yaa hastrekha shaastra bhi kaha jaataa he
 The use of this art is seen worldwide with many cultural variations
 jo hastrekha padhate hai, unhen aam taur par hastrekhavid, hatheli padhane vaala, haath padhane vaala, hastrekha vishleshak yaa hastrekha shastri bhi kaha jaataa he
 Palmistry is generally considered pseudoscience
 neeche ullikhit jaankaree sankshep main aadhunik hastrekha shaastra ke mukhya tatv he, jinamein se kai vibhinn rekhaon kii vyakhya aksar virodhabhasi hoti hai or hastrekhavid vibhinn "skulon" main bante hote hai
 Palmistry has its roots in Chinese wising, astrology in India and Roma prophets
 mana jaataa he ki hindu rishi valmiki ne ek pustak likhi, jiske sheershak kaa angreji anuwaad "da teachings of valmiki maharishi on mail pamistry" hoga or jisamen 567 shloke hai
 From India, palmistry spread to China, Tibet, Egypt, Persia and other countries of Europe
 china se, hastrekha shaastra kaa yunaan main prasar hua, jahaan anexagores ne iskaa prayog kiya
 However, modern palmists have often associated traditional futuristic techniques with psychology, holistic diagnosis, alternative methods of estimation as well
 hastrekha shaastra main haath vyakti kii hatheli ko "padhakar" uske charitra yaa bhavishya ke jivan kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 Various "lines" and "peaks" or, are suggested by reading, presumably in relation to their associated sizes, properties and intersections
 kuch rivaajon main hastrekha padhane vaale ungaliyon, nakhunon, ungaliyon ke nishaan or vyakti kii twachaa kii rekhaon, twachaa kii bunaavat va rang, aakaar, hatheli ke aakaar or haath kaa lacheelaapan bhi dekhte hai
 a palmist is usually the 'dominant hand' of the person
 In some traditions of palmistry, the other hand is assumed to hold hereditary or family traits or is based on the palmist's cosmological beliefs, giving information about past life or pre-birth conditions
 "shastreey" hastrekha shaastra ke liye buniyadi dhaanche kii jad unani puranic kathaon main nihit hai
 Each area of the palm and fingers belongs to a goddess or deity and the features of that area are indicative of the nature of the corresponding aspect of the subject
 udhaaharan ke liye, anamika apollo unani devtaa ke saath judi he; anguthi vaali is ungali kii visheshtaayen kala, sangeet, saundaryashastra, shoharat, dhan or sadbhaav san sambhddha vishyon kii vivechna ke dauraan dekhin jaati hai
 Although there has been debate about which hand is better to read, both have their own importance
 yah maanane kaa rivaaj he ki baanyaa haath vyakti kii sambhaavnaaon ko pradarshit karata he or dahinaa sahi vyaktitv kaa pradarshak hota he
 Some say the importance is about which hand is seen
 "daahine haath se bhavishya or baayen se ateet dekha jaataa he
 "" The left hand tells what we are born with and the right shows what we have made of it
 " "dahinaa haath purushon kaa padhaa jaataa he, jabaki mahilaon kaa baayan haath padhaa jaataa he
 "" The left hand tells what God has given you and the right tells you what to do in this regard
 " But these are all things to say, only instinct and experience will tell you better which hand will be better to read in the end
 hastrekha shaastra or unhen padhane ke prakaar ke aadhaar par hastrekhavid hatheli kii akruti or ungaliyon kii linon, twachaa ke rang or bunaavat, nakhunon kii banaavat, hatheli or ungaliyon kii anupaatik aakaar, poron kii pramukhataa or haath kii kai anya khaasiyaton ko dekh sakate hai
 In most streams of palmistry, hand figures are divided into 4 or 10 major classical types and sometimes resort to classical elements or features
 haath kaa aakaar sanketit prakaar ke charitra ke lakshanon However, despite the different forms, the most common classifications are used by modern palmists
 swayan apni hatheli main prabhutv vaale tatv tathaa prakruti nirdhaarit karnaa sahaj he haath ke aakaar ke vishleshan main rekhaon kii sankhya or panktiyon kii gunvattta bhi shaamil kii ja sakati he
 In some traditions of palmistry, earth and water hands have fewer and deeper lines, while air and fire hands may show more lines that have less clear definition
 lagbhag sabhi haathon main teen rekhaaen pai jaati hai or aam taur par hastrekhavid in par sabase zyada jor dete hai
 This line originates from the edge of the palm above the thumb and rises in the shape of the arch in the direction of the wrist
 mana jaataa he ki yah rekha vyakti kii urja or shakti, shaareerik swasthya or aam khushhaali kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 It is also believed that lifelines reflect changes in life including accidents, bodily injuries, restorations
 aam dharna ke vipareet, aadhunik hastrekhavid aam taur par yah vishwaas nahin karte ki ek vyakti kii jivan rekha kii lambaai ke vyakti kii umr se judi hui he
 Additional main lines or forms include: hastrekhashastra ke anusaar, yah rekha ek vyakti ko uddeshy kii tivrata yaa kisi uddeshy ke prati ekaagratha pradaan karti he, jiskaa swabhaav haath par is rekha kii sahi sthiti or isse nikalanevaali kinhin shakhaon se nirdhaarit hoti he, jo ek saamaanya maamla hota he
 In those hands, in which such line is present as a single sign with no branch, it indicates a very deep nature and needs special care of individuals
 is rekha kii saamaanya sthiti sabase badi ungali ke neeche shuru hoti he or saamaanya rup se vahaan samaapt hoti he, jahaan dil kii rekha choti ungali ke neeche haath ke kinare khatm hoti he, isse vyakti ke ausat hiton kaa sanket miltaa he or swabhaav kii gahanta vishuddh rup se yahaan se nikalanevaali kinhin shakhaon kii disha se nirdhaarit hoti he
 The upper half of the palm, which is immediately below the fingers, represents the person's higher or intellectual nature and the lower half of the palm represents the materialistic side of the person's temperament
 agar in aadhe-aadhe hisson main se ek bada hota he, jo mukhya rekha kii kendriya sthiti yaa is maamle main ekal anuprastha hatheli rekha se nirdhaarit hota he, vyakti ke swabhaav ke vyapak vikaas ke pahalu ko pradarshit karata he
 While it is a general theory that if this line falls below its normal position it indicates a deeper intellectual temperament, but if it is above its normal position, it reflects a more materialistic nature and interests
 is rekha se nikali kinhin shakhaon kii disha kaa is rekha par mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he, jisase upar paribhaashit parinaamon se upyukt sanshodhan hote hai or yah haath ke ubhaar kii prakruti par aadhaarit hota he
 For example, if a branch from this line moves towards the lower edge of the hand at the Moon's protrusion opposite the thumb, it indicates that the person is emotional and quite hesitant
 anya choti rekhaaen: Those who hold such truths to the test of logic often classify palmists as alleged psychologists, using a technique called "cold reading"
 cold reeding ko ek aisa abhyaas mana jaataa he jisamen hastrekhavidon sahit sabhi prakaar ke rekha adhyayankartaaon ko maansashasthri ke samaksh pesh hona padataa he
 According to a slightly more widely accepted finding, the accuracy of palmistry has been accepted as a system of character analysis, and no conclusive evidence has yet been found that there is a connection between palm lines and the person's character
 isse pare ki vishleshan se taarkik aadhaar par tay kiya jaye ki vyakti kaa ek gunasutra vikaar se peedit hona yaa ek nishchit anupaat main sankhyikeey samooh unke ankon ke aadhaar se sambhddha hote hai
 No conclusive data or facts have yet been found to support the claims made by the palmist in relation to life span or personality type
 samipya siddhant, cypress doctrin kaa hindi roopaantaran he
 Cypress Doctrine is a Norman French word which literally means - 'as near as possible'
 yah ek vidhik siddhanth he jo sabase pehle samya nyaayalayon main uthaa
 a feature of a religious trust is that if the testator has expressed a complete and definite desire for charity in his will, or from the alleged details in the will, the court comes to the conclusion that the will has given his property for charity, So the court will not allow donations to go in vain
 arthath vil main danarth di gai sampatti ko nyaayalay daan ke nimitt hi yathasambhav kharch hone kaa aadesh degaa
 If the goal of the alleged donation has never existed in the will, however, the court will prepare a charitable plan and allow the will of the will to be fulfilled
 kintu samipya siddhant ke lagu hone ke liye daan kaa lakshya nirvivaad hona aavashyak he
 By investing any amount of money towards charity or patriotism, the donation will be in vain as it does not reveal the solitude of the donor for charity
 deshbhakti daan kii paribhaasha se baahar he
 In such a situation, the specified amount will come in the residue of the estate for charity and according to the will, the heir of the residue will be the beneficiary in this amount
 kintu yadi koi raashi daan yaa paroapkaar ke liye di gai ho, to daan vyarth nahin hoga, kyonki daan or paroapkaar ke lakshya main vishmata nahin maani jaati he
 If the willful entity could not divide the property between the payable targets, the court would divide the said amount equally between the two targets
 samipya siddhant kii utpatti kab or kis tarah hui, anishchit he
 But Judge Lord Alden stated in Magiraj v
 Thackwell 70 Ways, 69, that there was a time when in England a portion of the remains of each estate was spent for charity and the person inheriting the property considered it his duty to do so morally , Because it was believed that those who do will have a feeling of charity
 jab kanoon dwaara sampatti kaa vibhaajan anivaary ho gaya ho to aisa sochna asambhav nahin ki danarth sampatti main bhi vahiin siddhant lagu hua ho
 There are two restrictions in applying the symmetry principle - yadi vil karne vaale ne daan ke lakshya kaa sanket kiya he tathaapi lakshya kaa karyanvayan hona asambhav yaa avyaavhaarik he, yaa bhavishya main aisi yojana chaalu nahin rakhi ja sakati to nyaayalay vil ke lakshya se yathasambhav milte-julate kisi anya lakshya ke nimitt ukt raashi vyay karne kaa aadesh degaa

 vil main di hui raashi lakshya ke nimitt purv se hi adhik he yaa peeche aavashyaktaa se adhik ho jaati he to aavashyaktaa se adhik raashi ke prayog main samipya siddhant lagu hoga
 See Rie Robertson 2 Chancery, 71
 daan kaa uddeshy dikhalaane ke liye kya aavashyak he, is prasang main koi niyam rakhana asambhav he
 The decisions given by the court reflected both liberal and conservative statements
 nirdisht daan yadi anyaanya daan ke saath mishrit ho, jo swat: purna evam asandigdh ho, to daan kii bhaavana spasht ho jaati he
 See, Rei Knox Chancery 109
 kintu yadi vil karne vaale ke man main koi vishesh daatavya lakshya rahaa ho or us lakshya kii purti sambhav na ho to daan vyarth ho jayega tathaa daan kii raashi daata ke paas laut jaaegi or yadi vil ke dwaara daan diya gaya ho to vah raashi sampatti ke avshesh main aa milegi
 See, Ri Whites Trust, 33 Chancery 449
 yadi vil karne vaale ne kisi vishesh lakshya ke nimitt daan diya he evam uski mrityu ke purv hi vah lakshya lupt ho chukaa he, to nyaayalay ke liye ukt lakshya ke nimitt daatavya bhaavana kii nivritti karnaa kathin ho jayega
 If the court did not find a sense of virtue, the property intended for donation would be found in the remains
 isi prakaar yadi daan kisi vyakti vishesh ke liye diya gaya ho evam vah bhakthi vil karne vaale se pehle hi mar chukaa ho to ukt daan samaapt ho jayega
 The charitable goal, if there is an institution and it is present at the time of death of the will, but disappears, then the property will become that of the government and the government will apply the principle of proof for it

 nav aflatunavaad unani darshan kaa antim sampradaay, jisane isa kii teesri shatabdi main viksit hokar, patanonmukh unani darshan ko, lagbhag paune teen sau varsh, athwa 529 i
 main roman samrat justin kii ajna se athens kii academy ke band kiye jane tak, jivit rakhaa
 The founders, by associating the name of this sect with Aflatoon, expressed their reverence for the best-known Greek philosopher on the one hand; On the other hand, there was no better way to prove the authenticity of your opinion in odd circumstances
 iske naam se yah anumaan karnaa ki yah aflatoon ke mat kaa anuvartan maatr tha, samichin nahin
 Greek philosophy began in the infancy of Western civilization
 aflatoon tathaa uske shishy, arestu, ke darshan tak ukt darshan apane vikaas kii charam seemaa par pahunch gaya tha
 However, many satisfactory solutions to the fundamental problems of the world and human beings could not be given
 aflatoon ke darshan kaa sabase mahatvapurn paksh yahi hai ki usamen un sabhi vichaarsutron ko sahejkar rakhaa gaya he, jo prarambh se lekar aflatoon ke samay tak ke sampurna saanskrithik vikaas kaa chitra prastut kar dete hai
 This trend is also found in other later cults of Plato
 kintu antim sampradaay, naalflatunavaad main, aflatoon ke moulik vicharon se shiksha praapt karne ke saath saath, parvarti darshansampradaayon ke maton se bhi laabh praapt kiya gaya he
 Thus, this philosophy can be called the fruit of the gradual development of Greek philosophy
 iske sambandh main sabase aavashyak tathy yah he ki badalati hui paristhitiyon main, isane dharmanirpeksh unani darshan ko roman samrajya ke manonukool banane kaa praytn kiya
 In order to understand its activity, it is necessary to look at scattered ideas from Aflatoon to the third century CE
 yunaan ke jivan tathaa darshan main kranti kii lahar daudane kaa shrey sucraat ko praapt he
 The saint criticized the so-called wisdom of his time for a lifetime and expressed anger at the lack of moral thinking and religious experience
 sucraat se prabhavit hokar, aflatoon ne purvavarti vichaaron ko vyavasthit darshan kaa rup dene kaa praytn kiya
 He wanted to coordinate the conscious and unconscious according to Heraclitus, the subtle and macro, by considering the credential power of Parmenides as the root cause of vision
 kintu, sookshm pratyay evam sthool vastu main yauktik virodh hone ke kaaran, use donon ko sambhddha karne ke liye kisi bich kii kadi kii jarurat thi
 This question was not presented before the previous materialists, because they did not imagine any duality in the world
 parmenidis tathaa uske anuyaayi, elia ke duusare sattavadiyon ke saamne bhi dwait kaa prashn na tha
 They were all monotheistic
 heraclitis main dwait kaa prashn na tha
 They were all monotheistic
 heraclitis main dwait kii thodi jhalak thi, kyonki usne ek or anek kaa prashn uthaaya tha
 But, it was also solved by the theory of its transformation
 yadhyapi roopaantar ke siddhant se hal hota nahin tha, kyonki ek or anek kaa roopaantar maan lene par gati, jise usne vishwa kaa vyapak niyam mana tha, maatr bhram thaharti thi
 Aflatoon was coordinating
 vah vyavhaar kii sarthakata kii drushti se indriyasanvedya jagat ko asat maananaa nahin chahta tha
 The suffix also could not be untrue, because if it had assumed the suffix to be false then the origin of the truth would have to be assumed from untrue
 donon ko kaayam rakhane ke praytn main, usne do sansaaron kii, pratyay jagat or vastu jagat kii kalpana kii
 But to maintain consistency in both, suffixes accepted the essence of objects
 arestu ne aflatoon dwaara sthapit dwait ko mitaane kaa bahut praytn kiya
 However, he too could establish the duality of shape and matter
 aflatoon ko naitik samasya sulajhane main bhi koi badi safalataa na mil saki, kyonki usne ucchtam pratyay main, jise usne sansar kaa mul kaaran mana tha, satya, shubh or sundar kaa samanvay kar, apane uttardaayitv se mukti le lee
 The problem of blood also remained where Socrates and Pythagoras had left him
 donon darshanikon ne maansik tanmayata main ucchtam satya kii anubhuti ke sakshya prastut kiye the, kintu us anubhuti kaa koi saidhantik vivechan nahin kiya tha
 Along with the life of Aristotle, the Greek monarchy was omitted and the philosophers of Athens had to take refuge in the Near East
 vahaan, khaskar, alexandria main ve navdith isai dharm ke sampark main aae
 Then he came to know that in that religion too, like the philosophy of Aflatun, the imagery of dual entities existed
 madhyasth kii kalpana bhi usee prakaar thi antar itnaa hi tha ki isai dharm ke ishwar main vyaktitv tha
 But, it was a matter of lot
 uchachatam pratyay kii apeksha ishwar vyakti se jagat ke kaaran, niyantaa evam poshak banane kii aakanksha karnaa maanav buddhi ke liye adhik ruchikar tha
 Therefore, the philosophers of Alexandria demonstrated the fundamental authority of Aflatun and the unity of God in Christianity
 philo ke darshan main unani darshan ore isai dharm ke mishran ke paryaapt pramaan uplabdh hai
 The difficulty was that in Christianity the mediator was not well conceived
 iske liye stoic darshanikon kaa samaran kiya gaya
 Being a Stoic material monotheist, he also had to imagine an intermediary to keep both the world and God interconnected
 heraclitis ne agni ko pratham tatv kaha tha
 The Stoics found no difference between fire and intelligence
 atev unhone yah maan liya ki jaise agni bhautik padaarth hote hue bhi chaaron ore apana taap vitarit karti he, usee prakaar ishwar buddhi kaa prasar karata he, jo sansar or manushya donon main vyaapt ho jaati he
 On the basis of this indication, Philo considered 'logas' to be the link between God and the world
 kintu philo kaa 'lagas' padaarth na tha
 That is the power of God, the idea, which can vary from body to body to become 'logai'
 padaarth ko philo ne aatma kaa bandhan mana tha
 Therefore, he was kept separate from God and people
 isi philo kii vichaardhaara ne teesri shatabdi tak nav aflatunavaad kaa rup liya
 The name of Ammonius Saccus is taken in place of the founder, but he is only one name for us
 sambhavat:, 242 i
 ke aasapaas uski mrityu hui thi
 We know his philosophy from the texts of his disciple, Platinus
 uskaa janm misr desh ke lycopolis naamak sthaan main, 204 i
 ke aasapaas anumit he
 In 245 AD he went to Rome
 vahiin apane darshan kii shiksha dete hue 270 i
 main uski mrityu hui
 Aristotle's explanator of logic, Porphyry, edited Platinus's texts in six volumes, each containing nine texts, which are available
 isliye platinus hi hamaare liye naalflatunavaad kaa sansthaapak he
 Platinus underwent a great change in the Christian philosophers of Alexandria
 ve ishwar ko sarvopari maanate the, itnaa dur, itnaa pruthak ki ant main, unhen ishwar ko agyeya kahana padataa tha
 Platinus, learning from the idea of socrates and Pythagoras with the idea of piety, described him as a soul attainable in the state of piety
 isi siddhant ke kaaran naalflatunavaad ko paashchaatya darshan ke rahasyavaad kaa janmdata samajha jaataa he
 Thus this philosophy includes both theoretical and practical aspects
 platinus ke darshan ke saidhantik paksh main teen mukhya bhaag maane ja sakate hai - praathmik satta, vichaaragegat evam aatma tathaa bhautik jagat
 The primary authority of Platinus is God
 vah ek, aseem tathaa aparimit he
 He is the source and cause of all finite and finite things
 vah shubh he, kyonki sabhi vastuon ke prayojan usee main he
 But God cannot be accused of moral virtues, because virtues are limits
 vah agun he
 Accusations of life and thought are also not possible, because they are beyond all reality
 vah ek sakriy shakti he, jo bina kisi gati ke, bina parivartan evam hraas ke, nirantar apane se bhinn sattaaon ko utpann karata rahata he
 Its production is not physical, but broadcast
 praathmik satta, athwa, pratham sat sabase pehle 'noose' ko prakat karata he
 'naus' is the model of the essence and essence of all things
 vah satta or vichaar donon he
 He is of his nature by being a replica of Satta
 bhinn bhi he, kyonki satta se utpann hua he
 Therefore, he is the mediator between God and the world
 aatma isi 'noose' kaa praturup he
 Therefore, the soul has the same relationship with Naus as that of the God of Naus
 spashtatya, aatma apadaarth he
 It is the link between Naus and Behavior
 kintu ek antar bhi he
 Naus is inseparable; But the soul is divisible
 tabhi to vah sharir jagat se sambandh rakh sakati he
 By becoming one, she becomes Jagadatma by associating with the world; The body becomes different per body
 ye atmaaen noose ke niyamon kaa paalan kar, pavitra daivi jivan bitaa sakati hai
 But this does not happen
 swatantra hone kii ichha se ve noose se vimukh hokar jagat ke andrik sukhon main lipt ho jaati hai
 Then they fall into bondage
 par aatma kaa yah bandhan icchaakrit hone se sthaayee nahin he
 By being alienated from the world, the soul can attain its original nature
 yaheen platinus ko apane darshan kaa vyaavhaarik paksh viksit karne kaa avasar mil jaataa he
 He tells that the wandering soul in the world first has to return to itself
 phir, vah noose main sthit hoti he
 Then she can wish for God
 is prakriya ko puraa karne kaa prayaas teen staron main kiya ja saktaa he
 These levels are the three levels of the practice of moral conduct - Narik, Purifier and Divine conduct
 pehle, parsparik prem evam sadbhaavna kaa abhyaas, phir pavitra jivan or tab ishwaronmukh hona
 Thus, the soul first comes into its own, then lies in the nous and then God desires to meet the first satta or his cause
 milan kii koi avadhi nahin
 Continuous divination and wishing to meet, those moments of attachment can come anytime in which she will be absorbed in the cause
 platinus ke anusaar, tanmayata ke kshanon main anirvachaneey anand praapt hota he or aatma nity prakaash main snaan karti he
 Parfiri has stated that during his six years of study, he had found his Guru four times in a state which he preached in his texts
 yah kathan satya ho yaa na ho, parphiri apane guru kii sadhana se bahut prabhavit tha or jivan bhar usne unki shikshaaon kaa prachaar kiya
 Iamblikus propagated the idea of platinus in Syria
 ymblicus ne platinus ke mat kaa syria main prachaar kiya
 Iamblikus propagated the idea of platinus in Syria
 chote plutark or proklas ne athens kii academy main unheen shikshaaon kaa upadesh kiya
 After Proclus, the academy was closed
 is prakaar, platinus kaa nav aflatunavaad hi unani darshan kaa antim rup tha
 But neo-imperialism did not disappear from western philosophy even when it was not a form of living sect
 pithagoras or sucraat ne apni rahasywaadee paddati kii koi vyakhya nahin kii thi
 This was the first time when Satya was interviewed in an orderly manner
 isliye, yah sochane kaa puraa mauka he ki baad ke darshan main jahaan kahin bhi satya ke saakshaatkaar kii baat aati he, vah nav aflatunavaad kaa prabhaav he
 Thus many of the medieval Christian saints, such as Tomas Aquinas, Arizona, Bruno, etc
, can be considered influenced by the said opinion
 yah prabhaav aadhunik kaal main bhi paaya jaataa he
 The insightists were all mystics
 henry bergasaan kii mrityu 1941 main hui
 He had given consent to look into all the things through insight, by denying intellect as insufficient for true knowledge of all things
 atev, yah kahana ayukt na hoga ki paashchaatya deshon main ab tak platinus kii paddati main vishwaas karanevaale maujuud hai
 This sect was so widespread

 Some scholars believe you were born in Rajapur district Banda

 After this, Vinaya Patrika is another important poem of his
 mahakavy shriramcharitamanas ko vishwa ke 100 sarvshereshth lokapriy kaavyon main 46vaan sthaan diya gaya
 Most scholars are in favor of considering Rajapur, the birth place of Tulsidas
 yadhyapi kuch ise soron shukarakshetra bhi maanate hai
 Rajapur is a village located in the Chitrakoot district of Uttar Pradesh
 vahaan atmaram dube naam ke ek pratishthit sarauparin brahman rahete the
 His wife's name was Hulasi
 sanwat 1511 ke shravan maas ke shuklapaksh kii saptami tithi ke din abhukt mul nakshatra main inhen dampati ke yahan tulsidas kaa janm hua
 According to popular folklore, the baby was extremely strong due to being in the mother's womb for twelve months and the teeth were visible in her mouth
 janm lene ke saath hi usne ram naam kaa uccharan kiya jisase uskaa naam rambola pad gaya
 Mother died on the second day of her birth
 pita ne kisi or anisht se bachane ke liye balak ko chuniyaan naam kii ek daasi ko saunp diya or swayan virakt ho gayi
 When Rambola was five and a half years old, Chuniya was also no more
 vah gali-gali bhatakta hua anathon kii tarah jivan jeene ko vivash ho gaya
 With the inspiration of Lord Shankarji, Shri Ananthanandji, a dear disciple of Shri Anantanand Ji, who lived on Ramshail, found this child who had become famous by the name of this Rambola and duly named it Tulsiram
 taduparant ve use ayodhya le gayi or vahaan sanwat 1561 magh shukla panchami ko uskaa yagyopavit-sanskaar sampann karaayaa
 At the time of the rites, even without being taught, the child Rambola pronounced Gayatri-mantra, which surprised everyone
 iske baad narhari baba ne vaishnavon ke paanch sanskaar karke balak ko ram-mantra kii diksha di or ayodhya main hi rahakar use vidyadhyayan karaayaa
 The wisdom of the child Rambola was very sharp
 vah ek hi baar main guru-mukh se jo sun letaa, use vah kanthsth ho jaataa
 From there, after some time, both the teacher and the disciple reached the sugar field
 vahaan narhari baba ne balak ko ram-katha sunaayi kintu vah use bhalee-bhanti samaj na aayi
 Jyeshtha Shukla Trayodashi, on Thursday, 1583, at the age of 29, was married to Kanya Ratnavali of the very beautiful Bharadwaja gotra, a village on the far side of the Yamuna, a little away from Rajapur
 chunki gauna nahin hua tha at: kuch samay ke liye ve kaashi chale gayi or vahaan sheshasnathan ji ke paas rahakar veda-vedang ke adhyayan main jute gayi
 While living there, suddenly one day he remembered his wife and started getting distraught
 jab nahin rahaa gaya to guruuji se ajna lekar ve apni janmabhumi rajapur laut aaye
 Since his wife Ratnavali was in the maternal house as he had not become a cowherd by then, Tulsiram swam across the sweltering Yamuna river in the dark dark night and went straight to his wife's bedroom
 ratnavali itani raat gayi apane pati ko akele aayaa dekh kar aashcharyachakit ho gayi
 When he asked them to return quietly in fear of public shame, they started urging him to go home at the same time
 unki is apratyaashit jid se khijhakar ratnavali ne swarchit ek dohe ke madhyam se jo shiksha unhen di usne hi tulsiram ko tulsidas bana diya
 The Doha that Ratnavali said was as follows: yah doha sunate hi unhone usee samay patni ko vahiin uske pita ke ghar chhod diya or waapas apane gaanv rajapur laut gayi
 On going to his house in Rajapur, when he came to know that his father was not there in his absence and the whole house was destroyed, he suffered even more
 unhone vidhi-vidhaan purvak apane pita ji kaa shraadh kiya or gaanv main hi rahakar logon ko bhagwaan ram kii katha sunaane lage
 After staying in Rajapur for some time, he again went to Kashi and started telling Ram Katha to the people there
 katha ke dauraan unhen ek din manushya ke vesh main ek pret mila, jisane unhen hanuman ji kaa pataa batalaaya
 Tulsidas, meeting Hanumanji, requested him to have darshan of Shri Raghunathji
 hanumanji ne kaha- "tumhen chitrakoot main raghunathji darshan hongen
 "on this Tulsidas ji started towards Chitrakoot
 chitrakoot pahunch kar unhone ramghat par apana asana jamaaya
 One day he went for circumambulation when suddenly in his way he saw Shri Ram
 unhone dekha ki do bade hi sundar rajkumaar ghodon par savaar hokar dhanush-baan liye ja rahe hai
 Tulsidas was attracted to see them, but could not recognize them
 tabhi peeche se hanumanji ne aakar jab unhen sara bhed bataaya to ve pashchaatap karne lage
 On this, Hanumanji consoled him and said that he would be seen again in the morning
 sanwat 1607 kii mauni amavasya ko buudhvaar ke din unke saamne bhagwaan shriram punah prakat hue
 He came as a child and said to Tulsidas - "baba! We want sandalwood, can you give us sandalwood?" Hanumanji thought, "may he not be deceived this time too, so he took the form of a parrot and said this couplet:" tulsidas shriram ji kii us adbhut chhavi ko nihaar kar apane sharir kii sud-budh hi bhul gayi
 Ultimately, God himself took the sandal from his hand and applied it on his and Tulsidas Ji's forehead and disappeared
 sanwat 1628 main vah hanuman ji kii ajna lekar ayodhya kii ore chal pade
 In those days, there was a Magh Mela in Prayag
 ve vahaan kuch din ke liye thahar gayi
 Six days after the festival, he saw Bharadwaja and Yajnavalkya Muni under a vatavriksha
 vahaan us samay vahi katha ho rahi thi, jo unhone sukarakshetra main apane guru se suni thi
 At the end of the Magh Mela, Tulsidas came back to Kashi from Prayag and resided at the house of a Brahmin at Prahladghat
 vahiin rahete hue unke andar kavitv-shakti kaa prasphuran hua or ve sanskrit main padya-rachana karne lage
 But all the verses he composed in the day, all of them would disappear in the night
 yah ghatana roj ghatati
 Tulsidas ji had a dream on the eighth day
 bhagwaan shankar ne unhen aadesh diya ki tum apni bhashaa main kavy rachana karo
 Tulsidas ji got sleepy
 ve uthakar baith gayi
 At the same time Lord Shiva and Parvati appeared to him
 tulsidas ji ne unhen sashtaang pranaam kiya
 Pleased on this, Shiva said - "you go to Ayodhya and write poetry in Hindi
 mere aashirwad se tumhaari kavita samaveda ke samaan falvati hogi
 "gaurishankar got into trouble after saying so
 tulsidas ji unki ajna shirodharya kar kaashi se sidhe ayodhya chale gayi
 The year 1631 started
 daivayog se us varsh ramanavami ke din vaisaa hi yoga aayaa jaisaa tretayug main ram-janm ke din tha
 That morning Tulsidas ji started the creation of Shri Ramcharitmanas
 do varsh, saat maheene or chhbbees din main yah adbhut granth sampann hua
 On the day of Rama's marriage in Margashirsha Shuklapaksa, in the year 1633, the seven scams were completed
 iske baad bhagwaan kii ajna se tulsidas ji kaashi chale aaye
 There he narrated Sri Ramacharitmanas to Lord Vishwanath and Mother Annapurna
 raat ko pustak vishwanath-mandir main rakh di gayi
 When the doors of the temple were opened in the morning, it was found written on the book - Satya Shivam Sundaram under which Lord Shankar was right
 us samay vahaan upasthit logon ne "satyam shivan sundaram" kii aawaaj bhi kaanon se suni
 Here, when the Pandits of Kashi came to know about this, their heart enraged
 ve dal banaakar tulsidas ji kii ninda or us pustak ko nasht karne kaa praytn karne lage
 He also sent two thieves to steal the book
 choron ne jaakar dekha ki tulsidas ji kii kuti ke aasapaas do yuvak dhanushbaan liye paharaa de rahe hai
 Both the youngsters were very beautiful, Shyam and Gaur Varna respectively
 unke darshan karte hi choron kii buddhi shuddh ho gayi
 He stopped stealing from that time and started worshiping the Lord
 tulsidas ji ne apane liye bhagavan ko ksht hua jaan kuti kaa sara samaan lutaa diya or pustak apane mitra todermal ke yahan rakhwa di
 He then wrote another copy with his unique memory
 usee ke aadhaar par duusari pratilipiyaan taiyaar kii gayin or pustak kaa prachaar dinon-din badhane laga
 Here the Pandits of Kashi, seeing no other remedy, prayed to the Mahapandit named Shri Madhusudan Saraswati to give his consent after seeing that book
 madhusudan saraswati ji ne use dekhakar badi prasannataa prakat kii or us par apni ore se yah tippanee likh di- Its meaning in Hindi is as follows - "tulsidas is a walking and moving plant of Tulsi in the joy-forest of Kashi
 uski kavy-manjari badi hi manohar he, jis par shriram rupi bhanvaraa sadaa mandraata rahata he
 " panditon ko unki is tippanee par bhi santosh nahin hua
 Then another way of examining the book was thought of
 kaashi ke vishwanath-mandir main bhagavan vishwanath ke saamne sabase upar veda, unke neeche shaastra, shastron ke neeche puraana or sabake neeche ramcharitamanas rakh diya gaya
 When the temple was opened in the morning, people saw that Sri Ramacharitmanas was placed on the Vedas
 ab to sabhi pandit bade lajjit hue
 He apologized to Tulsidas ji and took his footsteps with devotion
 tulsidas ji jab kaashi ke vikhyat ghat asighat par rahane lage to ek raat kaliyug moort rup dhaaran kar unke paas aayaa or unhen pidaa pahunchaane laga
 Tulsidas ji meditated on Hanuman ji at the same time
 hanuman ji ne saakshaat prakat hokar unhen prarthana ke pad rachane ko kaha, iske pashchaat unhone apni antim kriti vinay-patrika likhi or use bhagwaan ke charnon main samarpit kar diya
 Shri Ram ji himself signed it and made Tulsidas ji fearless
 sanwat 1680 main shravan krishna tritiya shanivaar ko tulsidas ji ne "ram-ram" kehete hue apana sharir parityag kiya
 Tulsidas ji's handwriting was highly beautiful as it was the art of calography in that era
 unke janm-sthaan rajapur ke ek mandir main shriramcharitamanas ke ayodhyakand kii ek prati surakshit rakhi hui he
 The following two verses were also published by Indraprastha Bharati, a magazine of Hindi Academy Delhi, outlining the personality and gratitude of Tulsi in the manuscript of Madanlal Varma 'krant', a poet with the same copy
 inamen pehla chand simhavlokan he jisaki visheshta yah he ki prayek charan jis shabd se samaapt hota he usase aage kaa usee se praranbh hota he
 The first and last words also remain the same
 kavyashastra main ise adbhut chand kaha gaya he
 The same verses were also published in the Tulsi Jayanti special issue of Sahityaprikaprama, another magazine
 apane 126 varsh ke deergh jivan-kaal main tulsidas ne kalkrmanusaar nimnlikhit kaaljayi granthon kii rachanaayen kin - Of these, the praise of a poet seems to be accurate in the works of Ramcharitmanas, Vinaya Patrika, Kavitavali, Geetavali - Pasya Devasya Poetry, Neither Mrnoti nor Jeerati
 arthath devpurushon kaa kavy dekhiye jo na marataa na purana hota he
 About four hundred years ago Tulsidas ji composed his creations
 aadhunik prakaashan-suvidhaon se rahit us kaal main bhi tulsidas kaa kavy jan-jan tak pahunch chukaa tha
 This is a direct proof of his popularization as a poet
 maanas jaise vrihad granth ko kanthsth karke saamaanya padhe likhe log bhi apni shuchita evam gyaan ke liye prasiddh hone lage the
 Ramcharitmanas has been the most popular text of Tulsidas ji
 unhone apni rachanaaon ke sambandh main kahin koi ullekh nahin kiya he, isliye pramanik rachanaaon ke sambandh main ant:sakshya kaa abhaav dikhaayi detaa he
 The books published by Nagari Pracharini Sabha Kashi are as follows: 'encychlopedia of religen and athiks' main grearsan ne bhi uparokt pratham baarah granthon kaa ullekh kiya he
 This is a rite of passage
 is geet main katipay ullekh ram-vivaah kii katha se bhinn hai
 Vairagya Sandipani is considered unnatural by Mata Prasad Gupta, but Acharya Chandrawali Pandey considers it authentic and an early creation of Tulsi
 kuch or pracheen pratiyon ke uplabdh hone se thos pramaan mil sakate hai
 The first Sorta of Saint Mahima's description is - vidwaanon ne ise tulsi kii rachana ghoshit kiya he
 In terms of style, it is an authentic creation of Tulsidas
 isaki khandit prati hi granthawali main sampadit he
 It appears to be an authentic creation of Tulsi
 isaki kaavyatmak praudhata tulsi siddhant ke anukool he
 The poem is simple, comprehensively interesting and succulent
 ""jagat maatu pitu sambhu bhavani"" kii shringaarik cheshtaaon kaa tanik bhi put nahin he
 The folk tradition is so status quo that it is less influenced by Sanskrit poetry of Sanskrit, and Tulsi's narrative narrative on the devotional role of Mati
 vyavhaaron kii sushthuta, prem kii ananyta or vaivaahik kaarykram kii sarasata ko badi saavdhaanee se kavi ne ankit kiya he
 Tulsidas was very satisfied with his creation, that is why this unhappy devotee has praised his mother only once - vidwaanon ne ise tulsidas kii pramanik rachanaaon main sthaan diya he
 But it also has intercept
 tulsi ke maanas ke purv valmikiy ramayana kii katha hi lok prachlit thi
 Tulsidas's differences with the pandits of Kashi about Tulsidas and Vishwanath's signature on the copy of Manas are famous
 yah jyotish shastreey paddati kaa granth he
 Divided into couplets, saptakas and cantos, this book is a mixed composition of various Mars and amalgamous episodes of Ramakatha
 kavy kii drushti se is granth kaa mahatva naganya he
 All consider it to be tulsified
 isamen katha-shrinkhalaa kaa abhaav he or valmikiy ramayana ke prasangon kaa anuwaad anek dohon main he
 Most of the couplets in Dohavali are of Manas
 kavi ne chatak ke vyaaj se dohon kii ek lambii shrinkhalaa likhakar bhakthi or prem kii vyakhya kii he
 Dohavali is a Doha collection
 maanas ke bhi kuch katha nirpeksh dohon ko isamen sthaan he
 It is possible that some couplets will also be projected in it, but the opaqueness of the composition is unquestionable
 kavitawali tulsidas kii rachana he, par sabha sanskaran athwa anya sanskarnon main prakashit yah rachana puri nahin prathit hoti he
 Kavitavali is a management work
 kathanak main apraasangikta evam shithilataa tulsi kii kala kaa kalank kaha jaayegaa
 The basis of the songs in Gitavali has been Ramcharit of various scandal
 yah granth ramcharitamanas kii tarah vyapak jansampark main kam gaya prathit hota he
 Hence the changes in these songs are not visible
 gitavali main geeton ke katha - sandarbh tulsi kii mati ke anuroop hai
 From this point of view a song of Geetavali can be taken - isamen bharat or ram ke sheel kaa utkarsh tulsidas ne vyakt kiya he
 The Uttarakand of Geethavali has more detail than the story of Manas
 isamen sita kaa valmiki ashram main bheja janaa varnit he
 The justification for this abandonment is found in these lines - shrikrishna gitavali bhi goswamiji kii rachana he
 Certain episodes of Shri krishna-katha are the subject of songs
 yah goswami ji kii hanumat-bhakthi sambandhi rachana he
 But this is an independent work
 iske sabhi ansh pramanik prathit hote hai
 Tulsidas loved Rama, the story of Rama was lovely, Rama was cute and Rama was cute
 unki buddhi, raag, kalpana or bhavukta par ram kii maryaada or lila kaa aadhipaty tha
 The image of Ram resided in his eyes

 The simple penalty is inadequate

 For this reason, in addition to the penalty for such a criminal, there is now a law for imprisonment

 On his return to Nagpur in 1915, he became active in the Congress and later became the secretary of the Vidarbha Provincial Congress
 When the country level session of the Congress was held in Nagpur in 1920, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar presented the first proposal in the Congress about the goal of complete independence, then it was not passed
 In 1921, Satyagraha was arrested in the non-cooperation movement of the Congress and he was imprisoned for one year
 By then he had become so popular that veterans like Pandit Motilal Nehru and Hakim Ajmal Kha addressed the gathering organized to welcome him upon his release

 This was the reason that when the anti-salt law movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1930, he personally handed over the responsibility of the Sangh chief to Dr
 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr
 Hedgewar Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar in all the Sangh branches on January 30
 It was resolved to attain full swaraj by hoisting the tricolor

 pitrubhu-punyabhu Bhushchev sa Hindu Hindu tradition is shloke ke anusaar “bharat ke vah sabhi log hindu hai jo is desh ko pithrubhumi-punyabhumi maanate hai”l iname sanatani, aryasamaji, jain, buddha, sikh aadi panthon evam dharm vichaar ko maanane vaale va unka aacharan karne vaale samast jan ko hindu ke vyapak daayre main rakhaa gaya tha l musalmaan va isai is paribhaasha main nahin aate the atah unako is milicia main naa lene kaa nirnay liya gaya or keval hinduon ko hi liya janaa tay hua, mukhya mantra tha “aspashtataa nivaaran evam hinduon kaa sainiki kaaran”l To create such a militia, volunteers were recruited, branches were started for one hour each morning and evening
 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc
 were created
 In these branches it was decided to provide military education to senior volunteers along with exercise, manual labor, education of Hindu nationalism
 Sometimes during the night there were seminars of volunteers, including Maharana Pratap, Veer Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Banda Bairagi, Veer Savarkar, Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope etc

This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us
 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right
 ek anya avasar par dow headgavar ne kaha tha “sangh to keval, hindusthan hinduon kaa- is dhyey vaakya ko sachcha kar dikhaanaa chahta he l” duusare deshon ke saamaan, “yah hinduon kaa hone ke kaaran”- is desh main hindu jo kahenge vahi purv disha hogi l yahi ek baat he jo sangh jaanata he, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye kisi bhi anya pachade main padane kii aavashkata nahin he l” When Veer Savarkar was off sight in Ratnagiri, Dr
 Hedgewar went to meet him there
 tab tak vah vir saavarkar rachit pustak hindutv bhi pard chuke the
 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"
 donon kaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak hindu andh vishwaas, puraani roodhiwaadee soch, dharmik aadambaron ko nahin chhodenge tab tak hindu-jateevaad, chhot-achhut, shahari-banavaasi or chhetravaad ityadi main banta rahegaa or jab tak vah sangathit evam ek jute nahin hoga, tab tak vah sansar main apana uchit sthaan nahin le sakegaa
