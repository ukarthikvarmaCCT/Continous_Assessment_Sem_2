 In the 1950s, David Bates and Marcel Nicolet provided evidence that various free radicals in particular hydroxyl and nitric oxide could catalyze this recombination reaction
 or ozon kii samgr maatra main kami laate hai
 These free radicals were thought to be present in the stratosphere and were therefore considered a part of the natural equilibrium; It is believed that in their absence the thickness of the ozone layer would have been two times the current state

 unhone angootha tech ke sthaan par vaigyanik prabandh sujhaayaa
 He divided human activities into small parts and found out how he could do it with less time and more productivity
 isamen vyavsaayik kriyaaon ko stareey upkaran, 
 In the words of taylor baithlaham steel company, jisamen tailor swayan karyrat the, main vaigyanik prabandh ke siddhanton ko lagu karne se utpaadakta main teen guna vruddhi hui
 Therefore it would be appropriate to consider these principles
 tailor ne prabandh ke kshetra main vaigyanik paddati ko lagu karne kii pahal kii
 We have already discussed the limitations of the Management Thumb Tech rule
 ab kyonki sabhi prabandhak apane-apane angootha tech niyamon ko apnaayenge isliye swabhaavik he ki sabhi samaan rup se prabhavi nahin honge
 Taylor believed that increasing efficiency was the only best method
 is paddati ko adhyayan evam vishleshan ke dwaara viksit kiya ja saktaa he
 The method developed in this way should be applied in place of the 'thumb Tech Rule' throughout the organization
 vaigyanik paddati main praarambhik pranaaliyon kaa kaary adhyayan, sarvshereshth tareekon kaa ekikaran evam stareey paddati ke vikaas ke madhyam se jaanch padtaal sammilit thi, jise ki puure sanghathan main apanaaya janaa chahie
 According to Taylor, the small production process of loading iron rods in canned trains can also be planned and managed scientifically
 isse maanviya shakti evam samay tathaa maal kii barbaadi main baari bachat hogi
 The more systematic the process, the greater the savings
 vartmaan sandarbh main internet kaa prayog aantarik kaarykushalta evam graahak kii santushti main ascharyajanak parivartan laayaa he
 In the factory system of production, there are links between managers, owners and workers
 prabandhakon ko shramikon se kaary puraa karaane kaa adhikaar mila hota he isliye aap saralata se samaj sakate hai ki ek prakaar ve varg bhed arthath prabandhak banaam shramik, kii sadaa sambhaavna bani rahati he
 Taylor found that because of this confrontation, workers, managers or factory owners do not benefit anyone
 usne prabandh evam shramikon ke bich puri tarah se sahyog par jor diya
 Both should understand that both are important
 is sthiti ko paane ke liye tailor ne prabandhak evam shramik donon main sampurna maansik kranti kaa aahwan kiya
 This meant that there should be a change in the thinking of both managers and workers
 aisa hone par shramik sanghathan bhi hadtaal karne aadi kii nahin sochenge
 If the company benefits, then managers must share it among employees
 karmchaariyon ko bhi chahie ki company kii bhalaai ke liye vah parishram karen evam parivartan ko apnaayen
 According to Taylor, scientific management is based on the conviction that the interests of both are the same, the prosperity of managers without the prosperity of employees and conversely the prosperity of the workers without the prosperity of the workers can also not last long
 japaniyon kii kaary samskruti is sthiti kaa utkrisht udhaaharan he
 Japanese companies administer ancestral style
 prabandhak evam shramikon ke bich kuch bhi chupa nahin hota
 Workers strike black cats if they go on strike, but they work more than normal hours to get the sympathy of the management
 vyaktvaad ke sthaan par shram evam prabandh main purnroop sahyog hona chahie
 This cooperation is not an extension of the principle of collision
 pratiyogita ke sthaan par sahyog hona chahie
 Both should understand that both need each other
 iske liye aavashyak he ki yadi karmchaariyon kii ore se koi rachanaatmak suzav aata he to us par dhyaan dena chahie
 If his suggestion reduces the cost enough, he should get the award
 unki prabandh main bhagidaari honi chahie or jab bhi koi mahatvapurn nirnay liya jaae to shramikon ko vishwaas main lenaa chahie
 Along with this, workers should also not go on strike and do not demand unfair treatment
 vastav main yadi khuli sampreshan vyavastha evam aapas main vishwaas hoga to shram sanghathan kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin hogi
 Japanese companies will have the same patrilineal style arrangement in which the employer takes into account the needs of the employees
 tailor ke anusaar shramik evam prabandh ke bich kaary evam uttardaayitv kaa lagbhag samaan vibhaajan hoga
 The entire time management will work side by side of the employees
 unki sahaayta karegaa, protsaahit karegaa evam unka maarg prashast karegaa
 Industrial work capacity depends largely on the qualifications of the employees
 vaigyanik prabandh bhi karmchaariyon ke vikaas ko manyata detaa he
 Training of staff was necessary to learn the best method developed as a result of working in a scientific manner
 tailor kaa vichaar tha ki kaarykushalta kii neenv karmchaaree chayan prakriya main hi pad jaati he
 Every person should be selected scientifically
 jo kaary use saunpa jaataa he vah uski shaareerik, maansik evam bauddhik yogyataon ke anuroop hona chahie
 They should get the necessary training to increase their efficiency
 kaarykushal karmchaaree donon kii adhiktam kaarykushalta evam samruddhi sunishchit hogi
 It is clear from the above description that Taylor was a staunch supporter of the scientific method in the production of business
 tailor dwaara nirdhaarit takneekein uske apane karier / jivan vritti ke dauraan kiye gaye shodh kaaryon par aadhaarit hai
 In the factory system, the foreman is the manager, who directly comes to the workers daily in contact
 is pustak ke pratham adhyay main aapane padhaa ki forman nimnatam str kar prabandhak or ucchtam shrenee kaa shramik hota he
 It is the focal point around which the entire production planning, implementation and control revolves
 tailor ne kaarkaana dhaanche main is bhoomika ke nishpaadan ke sudhaar par dhyaan diya
 Prepared a list of qualifications of a really good foreman / supervisor but found that no person could fulfill them, so he suggested functional foremanship through eight persons
 tailor ne niyojan evam uske kriyanvayan ko alag-alag rakhane kii vakaalat kii
 This concept was extended to the lowest level of the factory
 yah kriyaatmak formanship kehalaata he
 There were planning officers and production officers under the factory manager
 niyojan adhikari ke adheen chaar karmchaaree kaary kar rahe the_ jinke naam hai nirdesan card clerk, kaarykram clerk, samay evam laagat clerk, evam kaaryshaala anushaasak
 These four respectively will prepare instructions for employees, employees, prepare production schedule, schedule time and cost list and ensure discipline
 utpaadan adhikari ke adheen jo karmchaaree kaary karenge ve hai-gatinayak, tolinayak, marammat nayak evam nireekshak
 They are respectively responsible for preparing working hours properly, keeping machine tools fit for work by workers and checking the quality of work
 kriyaatmak formanship shramavibhaajan evam vishishtikaran ke siddhant kaa nimnatam str tak vistaar he
 Every worker has to take orders from these eight Formanas of production work or related process
 forman main buddhi, shiksha, chaturth, sthirataa, nirnay, vishisht gyaan, shaareerik dakshata evam urja, eemaandaaree tathaa acha swasthya
 Because all these qualities cannot be found in one person, Taylor suggested a team of eight experts
 prayek visheshgy ko uski apni yogyatanusaar kaary saunpa jaataa he
 For example, those who are well-versed in technology, are intelligent and have a stable mind can be assigned planning tasks
 jo urjavan hai evam acha swasthya liye hai unako kriyanvayan kaary saunpa ja saktaa he
 Taylor was a strong advocate of standardization
 uske anusaar aguntha tech niyam ke antargat utpaadan paddatiyon ke vishleshan ke liye vaigyanik paddati ko apnaanaa chahie
 The best system can be reserved for standard development and further improvements that should be put into use throughout the organization
 isko kaary adhyayan takneekon ke madhyam se kiya ja saktaa he jisamen samay adhyayan, gati adhyayan, thakaan adhyayan evam kaarividhi adhyayan sammilit hai tathaa jinka varnan isi adhyay main aage kiya gaya he
 It should be noted that contemporary techniques of business process, engineering, caiman and milestones were also the goal of certification
 pramapikaran se abhipraay prayek vyavsaayik kriya ke liye maanak nirdhaaran prakriya se he
 The standardization process can be of raw material, time, product, machinery, working method or working conditions
 yah maanak maandand hote hai, utpaadan ke dauraan jinka paalan karnaa hota he
 The objectives of standardization are as follows: sarleekaran kaa uddeshy vyarth kismon, aakaar evam ayaamon ko samaapt karnaa hota he, jabaki pramapikaran kaa arth he vartmaan kismon ke sthaan par nayi kismein taiyaar karnaa
 In simplification unnecessary redundancy of production is eliminated
 isse shram, mashin evam upkarnon kii laagat kii bachat hoti he
 This includes keeping the goods unmanned or low, total use of equipment and increasing the period
 adhikansh badi companiyaan jaise nokia, toyota, evam microsofrat aadi ne pramapikaran evam sarleekaran kaa safaltaapurvak kriyanvayan kiya he
 This is evident from their huge share in their respective markets
 kaary paddati adhyayan kaa uddeshy kaary ko karne kii sarvshereshth paddati ko foondnaa he
 There are many ways of doing a task
 sarvshereshth maarg ke nirdhaaran ke kai prachal hai
 Every process of action, from obtaining raw materials to delivering finished goods to the customer, is under study
 tailor ne kaary paddati adhyayan ke madhyam se kai kriyaaon ko ek saath jodne kii avadharana kaa nirmaan kiya
 Ford Motor Company successfully used this concept
 aaj bhi auto companiyaan isko apana rahi hai
 The objective of this entire process is to keep production costs to a minimum and provide maximum quality and satisfaction to the customer
 iske liye kai takneekon kaa prayog hota he jaise, prakriya chart evam parichaalan anusandhan aadi kaa prayog
 To design a car, the set line means to determine the order of operations, location of employees, machines and raw materials etc
 yah sabhi kuch kaarividhi adhyayan kaa bhaag he
 Motion studies study the movements of various postures, which are performed to perform a particular type of work, such as lifting, keeping, sitting or moving
 anaavashyak cheshtaaon ko samaapt kiya jaataa he jisase ki kaary ko bhalee-bhanti puraa karne main kam samay lagata he
 For example, Taylor and his partner Frank Gilberth reduced brick making efforts from 18 to 5
 tailor ne yah dikhaa diya ki is prakriya ko apnaane se utpaadakta chaar guna bad gai
 If the postures of the body are studied closely, you will find that - vibhinn mudraon kii pahchaan karne ke liye tailor ne stopwach, vibhinn chihnon evam rangon kaa prayog kiya, gati adhyayan kii sahaayta se tailor aise upkaran dizin karne main safal rahaa jo shramikon ko unke prayog ke sambandh main shikshit karne main upyukt the
 The results it produced were truly amazing
 bhalee-bhanti paribhaashit kaary ko puraa karne ke liye yah maanak samay kaa nirdhaaran karata he
 Time measurement methods are used for each component of the task
 kai baar maap kar puure kaary kaa maanak samay nishchit kiya jaataa he
 The method of time study will depend on the quantity and frequency of work, time cycle of operation and cost of time measurement
 samay adhyayan kaa uddeshy karmiyon kii sankhya kaa nirdhaaran, upyukt prerak yojanaon ko taiyaar karnaa evam shram laagat kaa nirdhaaran karnaa he
 For example, it was decided by repeated observations that an employee's standard time to prepare a card board box is 20 minutes
 is prakaar se ek ghante main vah teen bakse taiyaar karegaa
 Assuming that a worker works for 8 hours in an innings
 jisamen se ek ghanta dopaher ke bhojan evam aaraam kaa nikaal dete hai
 In this way, at the rate of three boxes per hour, he will prepare twenty-one boxes in seven hours of work
 ab yah ek karmi kaa maanak kaary hua
 Wages will be determined accordingly
 koi bhi vyakti kaary karte-karte shaareerik rup se evam maansik rup se thakaan anubhav karne lagegaa
 From time to time, the person will regain the internal force and will be able to work with the former capacity
 isse utpaadakta main vruddhi hogi
 Fatigue studies determine the duration and frequency of rest intervals to complete a task
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi sanyantr main saamanytah aath ghante kii ek pari ke hisaab se teen pariyon main kaary hota he
 If the work is being done in an innings, then the worker will have to give some rest time for food etc
 yadi kaary baari shaareerik shram vaala he to shramik ko kai baar thodi-thodi avadhi kaa aaraam dena hoga
 So that his energy is compensated and he can make his maximum contribution
 thakaan ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai jaise lambey kaary ke ghante, anupyukt kaary karnaa, apane adhikari se sambandhon main maadhurya kii kami athwa kaary kii kharaab paristhitiyaan aadi
 Obstacles to good performance should be removed
 tailor vibhedatmak paarishramik pranali kaa jabardast pakshdhar tha
 He wanted to differentiate between skilled and unskilled artisans
 maanak avadhi evam anya maandand kaa upar varnit kaary-adhyayan ke aadhaar par nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 Artisans can be divided into skilled and unskilled classes based on these standards
 vah chahta tha ki kushal karmchaariyon ko paritoshik milanaa chahie
 Therefore, he started different wage rates to complete standardized works and different from standardized wages
 udhaaharan ke liye yah nirdhaarit kiya gaya ki maanak utpaadan prativyakti pratidin 10 ikai he evam jo is maanak ko praapt kar lenge athwa isse adhik kaary karenge unako 50 rupye prati ikai se mazdooree milegi jabaki isse neeche kaary karne par 40 rupye prati ikai se mazdooree praapt hogi
 Thus a skilled worker would get paid 11 × 50 = 550 rupees per day while an unskilled employee who designed the unit would get 9 × 40 = 360 rupees per day
 tailor ke anusaar 190 rupye kaa antar ek akushal karmchaaree ke liye kaary ko or adhik shreshthata se karne ke liye paryaapt abhiprerak he
 From his own experience, Taylor cites the example of an employee named "abycup" who worked at Bethlehem Steel
 usne, vaigyanik prabandh kii takneekon ke anusaar kaary karte hue pratidin box-car main kachche lohe ke ladaan main 12-5 ton prati vyakti pratidin se badhaakar 47 ton prativyakti pratidin vruddhi kar di jisase aay main 1-15 dollar se 1-85 dollar vruddhi hone se 60 pratishat kii vruddhi hui
 It will be important to revisit the techniques of scientific management once again as this efficiency is integrated by integrating all the methods of Taylor
 kaarykushalta kii khoj ke liye ek sarvshereshth paddati kii khoj kerani hoti he tathaa chayan kii gai paddati din ke uchit kaary ke nirdhaaran main sahaayak hoti he
 There should be a system of compensation to treat those who have completed the proper work of the day or have done more than that
 yah vibhedatmak paddati is dharna par aadhaarit honi chahie ki kaarykushalta prabandhak evam shramik donon ke sanyukt praytn kaa parinaam hoti he
 Therefore, they should not dispute the share of surplus, but instead cooperate to increase production instead of limiting the production
 spasht he ki tailor ke vichaaron kaa saar / vaigyanik prabandh ke takanic evam siddhanton ke alag-alag varnan main nahin he, balki maansik dharna ke parivartan main he jise ‘maansik kranti’ kehete hai
 Mental revolution is the change in behavior of employees and management towards each other, that is, cooperation in place of competition
 donon ko samajhnaa chahie ki unhen ek duusare kii aavashyaktaa he donon ke lakshya aadhiky main vruddhi karnaa hona chahie
 This will not require any kind of movement
 prabandh ko aadhiky ke kuch bhaag ko karmchaariyon ke bich baantna chahie
 Employees should also exert their full power so that the company makes maximum profit
 yah drushtikon donon paksh evam company ke hit main hoga
 In the long run only the well being of the employees will ensure the prosperity of the business
 ham vaigyanik prabandh kii vartmaan sthiti kii bhi jaanch kar sakate hai
 In the present era, many new techniques have been developed in order of scientific management
 yuddh saamagree kii adhiktam tainaati ke liye parichaalan anusandhan kaa vikaas kiya gaya
 Similarly, Taylor discovered a gradual combination that was successfully used by Ford Motor Company in manufacturing the 'model T' for the masses
 is avadharana kaa ab bahut adhik prayog ho rahaa he
 a new development in scientific management is manufacturing
 aajkal utpaadan evam anya vyavsaayik gatividhiyon main robots evam computer kaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 This is the scientific form of management of these activities
 isse utpaadan str main vruddhi hui he
 Techniques of operational research have been developed and are being used due to scientific management
 vayovruddh dekharekh un vishesh aavashyaktaaon kii purti ko kehete hai jo vriddhavastha main aavashyak he

 kisi desh kii videsh niti, jise videshi sambandhon kii niti bhi kaha jaataa he, apane rashtriya hiton kii raksha karne ke liye or antarrashtriya sambandhon ke vaataavaran main apane lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye rajya dwaara chuni gai swahitkaari ranneetiyon kaa samooh hoti he
 a country's foreign policy is a set of policies to be followed on economic, political, social and military subjects with other countries
 vaishvikaran or antarrashtriya gatividhiyon main badhate gahan str kii vajah se ab rajyon ko gaiyr-rajya abhinaytaon ke saath bhi sahabhaagita kerani padegi
 The foreign policy of any country is mainly a set of certain principles, interests and objectives through which that state is working to fulfill those principles by establishing relations with other nations
 isi prakaar prayek rajyon kii apni videsh niti hoti he jiske madhyam se ve antararashtriya str par apane sambandhon kaa nirupan karte he
 Specifically, the first model, defining it, said that foreign policy is a system of actions developed by communities through which one state tries to change the behavior of other states and mold their activities in an international environment
 parantu videsh niti kii is prakaar kii paribhaasha ko ati sarleekaran mana jayega kyonki videsh niti kaa uddeshy maatr dusron ke vyavhaar kaa parivartan maatr nahin ho saktaa he
 But it is also very important to control the activities of other states through it
 is prakaar videsh niti main parivartan ke saath-saath kai baar nirantarata kii aavashyaktaa bhi hoti he
 Because both foreign policy changes and status quo policies are coordinated
 balki felims grass to isse bhi ek kadam aage nikal jate hai jab ve kehete he ki kai baar kisi rajya ke saath koi sambandh na hona yaa uske bare main koi nishchit niti na hona bhi videsh niti kehalaata he
 Thus, foreign policy has both positive and negative aspects
 yah sakaaratmak rup main jab hoti he jab vah duusare rajyon ke vyavhaar kaa prayaas karti he tathaa nakaaratmak rup main tab hoti he jab vah duusare rajyon ke vyavhaar ko pariwartit karne kaa prayaas karti he
 Hence foreign policy is a commitment to the principles, interests and objectives by which a state carries out its relations with other states in an international context
 is sandarbh main videsh niti par nirnay lene ke saath-saath iskaa anya rajyon ke saath sambadhon kaa vahan karnaa bhi ati mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 But at the time of such behavior, the state should also evaluate its profit and loss ie both resource and risk
 is sandarbh main ek mahatvapurn baat yah he ki videsh niti evam rashtriya hiton ke bich ek gahan sambandh hota he
 National interests play an essential role for foreign policy in various contexts- First, they provide a general orientation to foreign policy in the context of international environment
 dwitiya, ye nikat bhavishya kii sthiti main videsh niti ko niyantran karne vaale maapdandon kaa vikalp pradaan karte hai
 Third, national interests provide continuity to foreign policy
 chaturth, inhi ke aadhaar par videsh niti badalte hue atanrrashtriya swaroop main apane aapako dhaalane main sakasham ho sakati he
 Fifth, national interests provide a strong foundation for foreign policy because they are an expression of the values based on the co-ordinated and consensus of society

 aadhunik jeevigyaan ke sandarbh main, protoplast kii kai paribhaashaayen hai- Bhaj Govindam 5th century BC Is a popular Hindu devotional work written in Sanskrit, and is credited to Adi Shankaracharya for writing it
 yah rachana yah rekhaankit karti he ki prabhu ke prati bhakthi saamaanya aadhyatm kaa ek ati mahatvapurn bhaag he, jiskaa ki bhakthi yoga va bhakthi andolan dwaara samarthan kiya gaya he
 This classic creation is a souvenir of the fact that Adi Shankar, who is considered to be the great pioneer of the path of knowledge, did not hesitate to praise Bhakti as having reached the same goal
 tathaa jaisaa ki chakravarti rajagopalaachari ne apane bhashya main likhaa he, jab budhimatta paripakv hoti he to hriday main jamkar jaden jamaa leti he, vah pragna ban jaati he
 When that wisdom is combined with life and takes the form of action, then devotion becomes 
 gyaan jo paripakv hota he bhakthi kehalaata he
 If it does not turn into devotion then it is useless

 Passenger visa applicants are required to show that they are qualified under the provisions of the Immigrant and Nationality Act

 Therefore, in order to dispel this notion, applicants for a passenger visa must demonstrate the following: sabhi paryatak vija aavedakon ko saakshaatkaar shulk ke rup main 140 america dollar bhugtan karnaa hoga
 The interview is conducted by the embassy official at the United States Consulate, who decides on the applicant's eligibility to obtain a visa to travel in the United States
 yadi aavedak ko asweekaar kar diya he, to 140 dollar kaa shulk waapas nahin kiya jaataa he
 The things that matter in deciding eligibility include financial independence, adequate employment, asset material, plus no criminal record against the applicant's country

 Most immigrant visa applicants pay more than US $ 1,000 to become permanent residents in the United States after paying the processing fee, but actual immigration to the United States has to wait for years

 The salary required for that position is higher than the "actual salary" that is paid to other employees of that position or which is similar to the "prevailing salary", using any close source including the employer's own salary survey Be determined

 To obtain an H-1B visa, the employer must show that it will pay the prevailing local salary or more to other US citizens with similar education and experience
 niyokta ko yah sabit karne kii zarurat nahin he ki koi america shramik us kaam ko karne ke liye uplabdh nahin he
 However, some economists see the H-1B expansion as an attack on the American middle class that has benefited the wealthier and makes it impossible to maintain traditional American living standards, or more hard-core immigrants like countries like Japan
 This reduces the incentive for faster growth in productivity through policies
 ech-1bi vija par shramikon ko kaam par rakhane vaali companiyaan aksar hi kaha karti hai ki company dwaara kiye jane vaale jaruri vishisht kaam ke liye paryaapt america shramik nahin hai
 Many economists argue that America benefits more from the recruitment of these foreign employees and otherwise these employer companies will take all their work abroad
 It was claimed that this could prove to be worse for the US economy overall, because in the first case, foreign workers living in the US would spend in the US, while multinationals would send work abroad to American consumers
 May not save that much

 According to "samparikalpadrum", it was time to embark in the prosperous form of Goswami Sri Vitthalnath in the newly settled "gokul" village from Mathurapuri to Natidur and to decorate the various forms and beautiful principles of self-cultivation
 shri goswami ji ke prati anek atiranjak baaten mathura main sunakar or unki pariksha lene jaisi manovriti banaakar ek din chhitaswami apane do-chaar saathiyon ko lekar, jinhen "vaarta" main gunda kaha gaya he, gokul pahunche ore saathiyon ko baahar hi baitaakar akele khota rupaya tathaa thotha nariyal le vahaan gaye jahaan goswami vitthalanath ji apane jyeshtha putr giridhar ji ke saath swasampradaay sambandhin antarag baaten kar rahe the
 Chitu Goswami was stunned after seeing Giridhar ji's majestic form and started thinking in his mind, "I made a big mistake which came here to be prank on the pretext of taking your exam
" are, ye saakshaat purna purushottam hai - "jei tei, tei, ei kachu na andeh", at: mujhe dhikkaar he
 Hey, from whom have you come to be crooked? Chitu Choubey was repenting in such a way that suddenly seeing Goswami ji standing near the door without any prior recognition, he said, "hey, why does Chitaswamiji stand outside, come in, look in the day
" " chhitu choube, is prakaar apana mansahit naam sunakar or bhi dravit hue tathaa tatkshan bheetar jaakar donon haath jodakar tathaa sashtaang pranaam kar arj kii, ""jairaj, moi saran main leu, main man main bhaut kutilata laike yahan aayo ho so sab aapke darasanan te bhaji gai

 "" And picked up and hugged them, seated them with great love nearby
 tatpashchaat apane poojit bhagavadvigrah ke paas le jaakar unhen namamantra sunaayu
 On hearing Namamantra, "chitu" ji immediately composed a "verse" and sang it in a loud voice, which is as follows: "do sau baawan vaishnavan kii vaarta" main likhaa hua he ki ek baar chhitaswami apane yajmaan maharaj birbal ke paas apni "barsaudhi" lene agra gaye or unke yahan tehre
 In the morning, when he woke up, he remembered Srivallabhacharya

 "" chhitaswami birbal se yah kah or apana saamaan baandh tathaa salanaa barakhaasana chhod mathura vaapis chale aae phir gokul goswami ji ke paas chale gaye
 On the other hand, Emperor Akbar heard all this - the coming of Chhitswami and leaving his year after leaving Barkhasan
 unhone birbal ko paas bulaayaa ore samajhaate hue kaha- "jo birbal, tere pirohit chhitaswami ne tote kahu juthi baat tau kahi nahin, tumakon vu baat bhuli gai jab main or tu ek "nawada main baithe jamana kii saiyr kar rahe he

 maine use gusaain ji kii bhent kar di or unhone bina dekhe us mani ko usee jamana main daal diya; mujhe unki yah harakat acchhee na lagi or use vaapis maangi
 On my special stubbornness, he put his hands in the jamna and took out a lot of fistfuls and put them in front of me and said "tihari jo Mani hai wai pahachon ke leu
 " us samay main or tum donon unka yah harahungez karishma dekhakar but ban gaye or sochane lage ki aisa kaam sivaa "khuda" ke or koi nahin kar saktaa
 So you forgot the thing Birbal? And said so to his true traveler

 ek naveen mat ke anusaar kam se kam madhya pahari bhashaaon kaa udgam shauraseni praakrit he, jo rajasthani kaa mul bhi he
 The phonology of the Pahari languages, sound group, grammar, etc
 have been imprinted on many ethnic levels
 yaksha, kinnar, kiraat, naag, khas, shaq, arya aadi vibhinn jatiyon kii bhashaagat visheshtaayen praytn karne par khoji ja sakati hai jinamein ab yahan arya-aryetar tatv paraspar ghul mil gaye hai
 Historically it is known that in ancient times, some of their different forms were mostly oral
 madhyakaal main yah bhubhag rajasthani bhashaa bhashiyon ke adhik sampark main aayaa or aadhunik kaal main avaagaman kii suvidha ke kaaran hindi bhashaai tatv yahan pravesh karte ja rahe hai
 In a way the behavior of Pahari languages has become limited to domestic colloquialism, correspondence etc
 pahari bhashaaon main darad bhashaaon kii kuch dhvanyatmak visheshtaayen milti hai jaise ghosh mahapraan ke sthaan par aghosh alpapraan dhwani ho janaa
 The name of the western and central hill region was in the ancient times the editorlaksha
 yahan madhyakaal main gurjaron evam anya rajput logon kaa avaagaman hota rahaa jiskaa mukhya kaaran musalamaani akraman tha
 Therefore, in local languages, most of the "n" is targeted instead of "n" and the incipient tendency of non-intransitive words is a sign of Rajasthani influence
 purvi hindi ko bhi ekaadhik pravritiyaan madhya pahari bhashaaon main vidyaman hai kyonki yahan kaa katyur rajvansh suryavanshi ayodhya nareshon se sambandh rakhata tha
 On this basis, the relation of the Pahari languages with the semi-magadhi-kshetra also becomes clear
 inke vartmaan swaroop par vichaar karte hue do tatv mukhyat: saamne aate hai
 One is that they have different characteristics of Pahari languages from Hindi language
 duusare kuch tatv donon ke samaan hai
 Somewhere Hindi words are used alternatively with local words and elsewhere Hindi words are taking the place of local words
 khadi boli ke madhyam se kuch videshi shabd, jaise "hajaamat", "aspataal", "feeta", "sip", "dagdar" aadi bhi chal pade hai
 Three distinctions of Pahari languages can be determined: ise nepali athwa "khaskura" bhi kehete hai
 "gorkhali" is under this
 isamen likhit sahitya paryaapt he
 They are spoken in Kumaon and Garhwal, hence the names "kumaoni" and "garhwali" are famous on this basis
 uttar pradesh ke saat parvaty jile inke kshetra hai or inhen bolanewaalon kii sankhya lagbhag 16 lakh he
 The Kumaoni language is used in the districts of Nainital, Almora and Pithoragarh
 iskaa kshetra is samay lagbhag 8000 vargamil main vistrut he tathaa san 1951 kii janaganana ke anusaar ise bolanewaalon kii sankhya lagbhag 570,008 he
 Hindi is used as a second language
 is kaaran kumaunni hindi khadi boli ke atyadhik nikat aa gai he
 Grammatically, pronouns - I, you, we, you, u, u, are used
 sambandh kaarak bahuvachan kaa rup "unako" na hokar "unar" hota he
 Like in Hindi, only two genders are used in Kumaoni and this sexuality is not only based on the distinction of masculinity, femininity, but also on the size and nature of the object
 vachan do hai, tathaa hindi kii praaia: sabhi dhaatuen milti hai
 Gradation, and syntax are also similar
 aarambh main karta ant main kriyaapad rahata he
 Adverb also comes before the verb like in Hindi
 phir bhi kumaunni main kuch dhvaniyaan khadi boli hindi kii apeksha vishisht hai
 From the point of view of the vowels, the sounds Hrasva "aa", Harsva "A", Harsva "ae", Harsva "O" and Harsva "au" can be seen
 is bhed se shabdaarthon kaa antar ho gaya he
 For example, the word "kawan" means in Kumaoni - the word "kala" and "kava" means "kaal" - meaning death
 vyanjanon main vishesh "na" tathaa vishesh "l" kii uplabdhi hoti he
 Words like "kan", "bhanan" have a distinctive "no" sound which is pronounced towards certain rhythms
 vishesh "l" varna gangoli tathaa kaali kumaun kii boliyon main praapt hoti he
 There are eight dialects of Kumaoni - Khasrajia, Kumayyan, Pachai, Danpuria, Soormali, Sherali, Gangola, Bhotia
 kumaunni bhashaa kii lipi devanagari he
 Its oral literature is very rich, although written literature is also no less important
 gadhwali bhashaa main abhi pracheen tatv kumaunni kii apeksha surakshit hai
 It is practiced in district Garhwal, Tehri, Chamoli and Uttar Kashi
 yah kshetra lagbhag 10,000 vargamil he tathaa gadhwali bhashaa bhashiyon kii sankhya lagbhag 10 lakh
 There are traffic difficulties due to geographical reasons
 isliye pahadiyo ke donon ore rahanewaalon athwa ek hi nadi ke aarpaar rahanewaalon ke bhashaagat prayogon main visheshtaayen ubhar ai hai
 Tibetan in the dialects of the north, and the Kumauni influence towards the east is evident because the boundaries of these areas are mixed
 rajput jatiyon kaa nivas hone ke kaaran gadhwali par najasthani prabhaav to he hi, iske dakshin-pashchim kii ore khadi boli bhi apana prabhaav daalati ja rahi he
 Some characteristics of Garhwali language are visual
 iskaa jhukaav dirghatv kii ore he at: swaron main e, i, o, ou, kii dhvaniyaan, jinka deergh rup pradhan he, adhik prayukt hoti hai
 The tendencies of resonance are relatively low
 kuch aise shabd milte hai jo pracheen bhashaaon se chale aae hai jaise "mukh" ke arth main "gichcho" shabd
 It is possible that many of the received words are remnants of the oldest castes
 vyakaran kii drushti se gadhwali main ek dantagra "l" dhwani pai jaati he jo anyatra kahin nahin milti
 In verb forms, "o" or "ava" is added by omitting the final "a" of the metal, such as running
 lingabhed bhi pray: niyamit nahin
 Much attention is given to the shortness of things, gravity
 anek shabdon ke ekvachan, bahuvachan rup samaan chalate hai
 The characteristics of the idols "L" and "N" in the pronunciation are visual
 sthanbhed se gadhwali kii nau pramukh boliyaan hai - srinagariy, salaani, manjhkumaiyaan, gangavariy, badhaani, rathi, dasauliya, lobhiya or rarvalty
 The main difference seems to be the pronunciation
 gadhwali bhashaa kaa bhi maukhik sahitya mahatv rakhata he
 This is the third distinction of Pahari languages
 vastut: yah anek boliyon kaa samuhik naam he
 These dialects are spoken in Jonsar Bawar, Shimla, north-east-frontier Punjab, Kullu Valley, Chamba etc
 in sabhi boliyon kaa sahitya likhit rup main praapt nahin, is kaaran bhashaa vaigyanik khoj bahut kam ho pai he
 Till now the bids that can be fixed under this, their area is about 14 thousand square miles and the number of ballers is usually 16 lakhs
 inamen mukhya hai - sirmauri, jonsari, kului, champali, andiyaali or bhadravahee, aadi
 Most of the folklore and stories are popular in these dialects
 kului tathaa chambali par idhar kuch kaary hua he
 The region of Kului is, most likely, the area of the ancient Kunind waters that ruled here
 is samay yah boli kullu ghati se lekar himachal pradesh ke mahasu jile tak boli jaati he
 Champali is notable for its melodiousness and due to location differences it also gets "bhatiali", "churahi", etc
 variations
 mandiyaali suket main boli jaati he jabaki badhati solan kii ore
 There is a behavior of Quthali in the foursome of Shimla
 pehle pashchimi pahari kii ye sabhi boliyaan takkari lipi main likhi jaati thim kintu ab devanagari kaa prayog hota he
 1497 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 1497 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar
 adhikansh vishwa main isi paddati ke aadhaar par puraane varshon kii gananaa kii jaati he
 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 1497 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he

 In the poem, Beowulf is the protagonist of Gates, who battles with three enemies: Grendel, who attacks the resident warriors in the mead hall of Harugar, Grendel's mother and an unnamed dragon
 antim ladaai baad main hoti he, biovulf ab gates kaa raja ban chukaa he
 In the final battle, Beowulf is severely wounded
 uske dehanth ke baad uske samarthak use getland ke tumulas main dafna dete hai
 The events described in the poem date back to the late 5th and early 7th centuries, after the anglo-saxons settled in England, when the Saxons either immigrated to Scandinavia and northern Germany, or their European partner Kinsmen Were close kavita ko get mul ke logon dwaara england main sancharit kiya gaya ho saktaa he
 It is said that Beowulf was first composed in Randalsham, East Anglia in the 7th century, as Sutton Hoo also had close contacts in Scandinavia as well as descendants of the Wolfing of the former Anglian royal dynasty, the Waffings, Gate
 duusare is kavita ko raja eloard kii adaalat, yaa raja canute kii adaalat se sambandhit maanate hai
 The poem is based on mythology, that is, it was designed for entertainment and does not separate fictional events from actual historical events, such as the raid by King Hygelac on Frisia
 516
 Scholars generally believe that many of Beowulf's personalities are also available in Scandinavian sources, but this is not only related to the people, but also to the gharanas and some events
 scandinavian strot mukhyatah yangalinga saaga, gesta danoram, harolf kreki saaga or khoe scjoldunga saaga kaa latin saransh hai
 As far as Sweden is concerned, dating into the events of the poem is confirmed by archaeological excavations at the insignia of Snorri Sturlson and the Swedish tradition of Othere and his son Edgils as present in Upland, Sweden

 Archaeological evidence from the 19th century can confirm the Beowulf story
 snori sterlson ke anusaar, edgills ko apaslaa main dafnaaya gaya tha
 When excavated on the mound of Edgils in 1874, objects found during that time supported Beowulf and his stories

 Beowulf is known as a mythological epic, whose protagonist is a protagonist, who travels long distances to fight monsters and animals, full of divine powers
 kavita bhi medias res, yaa saamaanya rup se dekhen to "madhya main" shuru hoti he he, jo pracheen mahakavyon kii visheshta he
 Although the poem begins with the arrival of Beowulf, Grendel's attacks continue for some time

 The detailed history of the characters and their dynasty, as well as their interactions with each other, the essence of their actions, the deeds of their valor, etc
 are best described

 Chance stated that, "the two-part structure favored the generality of the proceedings of the British Academy 22 after its introduction in JRR Tolkien Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics"
 On the contrary, she argues that the three-part structure is "more popular"
 biovulf kii shuruyaat raja harugar kii kahani se hoti he, jisane apane logon ke liye mahaan haul hioroot kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 In it, his wife Velhapio and his warriors spend time celebrating by dancing, until an out-of-society gruesome Grendel attacks the hall and kills many of Harugar's warriors at bedtime and She devours them
 lekin grandal ke paas harugar ke singhaasana ko chune kii himmat nahin hoti he, kyonki use yah bataaya gaya he ki harugar kii suraksha k shaktishaalee devtaa karte hai

 Beowulf and his soldiers spend the night in Heorot
 jab ve sone lagate hai, tab grandal haul main pravesh karti he or hamalaa bol detii he or biovulf ke ek aadmi kaa bhakshan karne lagati he
 Beowulf, who had no weapon, which was an unfair advantage over the unarmed beast, was acting gold and Grendel leaped and held him in his hand
 donon ghamaashaan yuddh karne lagate hai
 Beowulf's followers attack with their swords, but their weapons also do not deter Grendel's hair
 antat, biovulf grandal ke sharir se uskaa haath uske kandhe se tod daalata he or grandal ansu nikal aate hai or maranasann avasthaa main apane ghar kii ore bhaag jaataa he
 The next night, after celebrating Grendel's death, Harugar and his men go to sleep in Heorot

 She kills Harugar's most loyal warrior, Ascher, in revenge for Grendel's death

 Beowulf prepares himself for battle, Unforth the warrior, giving him a sword
 harugar ko uske maranoparant karne ke liye kai sthitiyon ke liye pratigna dilaane ke baad, biovulf jhil main kud jaataa he
 Grendel's mother soon sees him and attacks him
 haalanki, vah apane hathiyaar ke madhyam se biovulf ko nuksaan pahunchaa nahin paati he, isliye use jhil ke nichle sataha tak khinch kar le jaati he
 Grendel's body and the corpses of the two men are kept in the cave, with fierce fighting between Grendel's mother and Beowulf
 sabase pehle, grandal kii maa prabal prathit hoti he
 Beowulf, unable to harm his enemy with his haunting, enrages him, it enrages him

 Going further into the lair, Beowulf finds Grendel's corpse, he cuts off his head and keeps it with him
 biovulf phir sataha par or apane saathiyon ke paas "nau ghanto" ke baad waapas laut aata he
 He goes to Heorot, where Hroगरgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including his family's inherited nagging sword

 One day, sometime in Beowulf's life, a slave steals a gold cup from an unidentified dragon's den in Ahernaness

 Beowulf and his warriors go on to fight the dragons, but when Beowulf is wounded by the dragon's blows, all his warriors run away in fear

 The two together kill the dragons, but Beowulf dies from his wounds

 Dragon's treasure is distributed along with Beowulf's will to distribute it among the people

 It is widely accepted that Beowulf's three funerals were performed
 ye shavyatraaen kavita kii kahani kii ruparekha main parivartan karne or saath hi sansaarik sampatti, yuddh or yash par darshakon ke vichaar parivartit karne main madad karti hai
 The funerals are also associated with the three wars described above
 teenon shavyatraaen prayek antim sanskaar ke vivaran ke madhyam se vishay main parivartan ke samaan prastaav saajha karte hai
 Gail owen-crocker argues in his book The Four Funerals in Beowulf, known as the poem's Lay of the Last Survivor ", which is an additional funeral
 shavyatraaen swayan ko sanchay karne kii rasm: dharmik or saamaajik-aarthik kaaryon donon ke saath tyaag kii vastuon ke sakshya shaamil karti he
 The first funeral in the poem is called Scyld Sefing, King of the Danes
 pehla bhaag kavi kii madad hrothgar ke vansh kaa parichay karaate hue kavita ke settings kii vyakhya karne main karata he
 The funeral procession introduces a confrontation with the protagonist Beowulf and the first demon Grendel
 yah ansh "kai janajatiyon ke abhishaap, sharaab ke takht ke vidhvansak" ke rup main scield kii mahima ke varnan ke saath shuru hota he
 Scyld's glory and importance are reflected by his distinguished death, which he received while serving as King of Dens
 unke mahatv ko ekbar phir logon dwaara nikaali gai uski bhavy shavyatra sabit karti he: uske antim sanskaar main pradarshit kai hathiyaar or khajaane uske mahaan yoddha or mahaan netaa hone kaa pramaan he
 The poet introduces the heroic society through Scyld
 aise vastuon ke mahatv ko raja kii sampatti ke saath dafan karke varnit kiya gaya he
 The importance of these earthly possessions has since been used to establish the greatness of this dead king in relation to the treasury
 scield kaa antim sanskaar kavi kii madad nyaayik samaaj ke yuddh main veerta or sansaarik sampatti kaise kisi vyakti ke mahatv ko paribhaashit karti he, yah bataane main karata he
 This funeral helps the poet develop the plot of the plot between the antagonist, Beowulf and the main demon Grendel
 kavita main antim sanskaar doosraa yah he ki parijan Hildeburg kii he or kavita FITT ke is duusare number par he
 The funeral is sung in Heorot to celebrate Beowulf's victory over Grendel
 yah grandal kii maa khilaaf ladaai main nayak kii jeet kaa pratik bhi he
 Hildeburg's brother, son and husband were killed in the war
 ladaai main scield kii bhi maut ho gaye thi or yah mrit ke antim sanskaar main upyog kii gaye asaadhaaran sampatti kii gaatha bhi he
 Like the King of the Danes, Hildeburg's relatives were also buried with their weapons and gold to show their importance
 haalanki, rishtedaaron kii shavyatra utani bhavy nahin thi, vah keval antim sanskaar samaaroh hi tha
 In addition, the poet has also depicted the feelings of those who died in the war
 "pighalate sir, khule gahar ghaav


 or sharir se nikalate hue rakt" jaise bheeshan vivaran yuddh ko vir-gaatha ke bajaay ek dardanaak or bhayaavah durghatana ke rup main varnit karte hai
 Although the poet has tried his best to give importance to the subject of property more than death, yet the glory of war challenges the tendency of vicious war
 duusari shavyatra pehali se bhinn avadharana pradarshit karti he or kahani kii disha main parivartan biovulf ke grandal kii maa ke khilaaf ladaai ko netritv karti he
 The "lay of the Last Survivor" is logically in addition to Beowulf's three other funerals due to the similarities set to the significance of the other buried people
 is ansh kii teen anya shavyatraaon ke saath pahchaan karne vaali samanthaayen dafnane kii rasmon, setting or bhoomika main parivartan or vishay main parivartan ke samaan he
 Mourning appears to be a funeral procession as burial proposals contain descriptions of the last survivor, which is also found in the funeral processions of Scyld Seifing, Hildeburg's family, and Beowulf
 antim uttarajive mrit logon dwaara chode gaye kai khajaanon ke bare main bataata he jaise hathiyaar, astr or swarna cap, jinke scield ke "behtareen chamkile cap


, kun se sane hathiyaar or kavach," hildebrg ke parijanon ke "kun se sane kavach or boar ke aakaar ke helmet" or biovulf ke dregon kii khoj ke saath kaaphi samanthaayen hai
 This excerpt is also known as the embalming hawk swift horse "
 yah ek jaanavar kii peshkash he jo ki kavita ke yug ke dauraan dafan karne kii ek rasm thi
 In addition, this excerpt, like other funerals, specifies changes in setting and role
 log yah bhi kehete hai ki kavita ke tisare bhaag main biovulf or dragon ke bich hue antim yuddh ke dauraan vyateet kiye gaye samay kaa varnan karata he
 The poet describes the deaths in the war as frightening, furthering the concept of the second part of the poem through the eyes of the last survivor
 kavita main varnit chauthi shavyatra hi biovulf kii asal shavyatra he
 After the final war against the dragons, Beowulf suffers a fatal wound and dies
 biovulf ke jivan kii mahanata ko uski shavyatra main varnit kiya gaya he, visheshkar uske logon kii kai shradhanjaliyon ke madhyam se
 iske alaava, dregon ke vishaal khajaane ko nayak ke saath dafan kar diya gaya
 The poet has also given more importance to Beowulf's description of the funeral than others
 unke netaa ke antim sanskaar ke liye, "viyohston kaa putr kai logon ke saamne yah ghoshnaa karata he ki ve chita se dur rahen
" dregon ke avasheshon ko scield kii kabr ke samaantar samudr main phenk diya jaataa he
 The funeral of Beowulf is the fourth part of the poem, a tribute to the hero who was "gracious and fair, kind to the people and sensitive to victory"
 biovulf pandulipi kaa pehla gyaat maalik 16veen sadi kaa vidwaan laurence nowell he, jiske naam par pandulipi kaa naam rakhaa gaya he, haalanki iskaa adhikarik pad coton vitaleus e

 Kevin Kierman argues that Nowell received it from William Cecil, the first Baron Burghley, in 1563, when Nowell went to Cecil's house as his son, Edward de Verve, 17th Earl of Oxford teacher
 1731 main coton librari ke eshbernan house main aag lag jane kii vajah se yah kshatigrast ho gaya tha
 Since then, many letters of part of the manuscript have been erased

 Kevin Kearman, professor of English at the University of Kentucky, used fiber optic backlighting to retrieve letters of poetry, for computer digitization and preservation of the manuscript
 kavita apane ekal pandulipi ke liye gyaat he, jisaki anumaanit tithi 1000 i

 Kierman argued after testing the manuscript that it was the author's own copy, which he worked on
 usne is kaary ko canute da great ke yug kaa bataaya
 The poem is available today in Beowulf Manuscript or Novel Codex, among other works
 francesus junius dwaara 1628 or 1650 ke bich nowell kodex ke pehle parnan kaa sandarbh sabase pehle diya gaya tha
 Who owned the codex before Nowell remains a mystery
 reverent thomas smith or hamphre vaanale ne coton librari kii namavali banane kaa kaary apane haathon main liya, jahaan nowell kodex ko rakhaa gaya tha
 Smith's catalog appeared in 1696 and Humphrey's in 1705
 a letter to the Beowulf manuscript was first mentioned in 1700 under the name of Georg Hiches, Wanley's assistant and Wanley

 Hickes replied to Wanley "I haven't found anything related to Beowulf yet"
 It was stated that Smith failed to mention the Beowulf manuscript because it relied on previous nomenclature or did not know how to describe it or it was temporarily removed from the codex
 mul biovulf pandulipi ko do lipikon dwaara pratilekith kiya gaya: lipic e or lipic bi, jinke patr ko pankti 1939 main rakhaa gaya he
 The handwriting of both clerks is not found at all

 Both clerks have corrected their work and Clerk b has also corrected the work of clerical A
 lipic bi ke kaam main bliculing homilies ke pehle lipic ke kaam jaisi saddrishyata he or yahaan tak kii yah vishwasaneey he ki ve samaan lipi se likhe gaye hai
 The transcription appears to have been written from books of knowledge kept in the library of Malmesbury Abbey and available as source works, and from some specific words of the local dialect found in the text
 haalanki, kam se kam ek sadi ke liye, kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana tha ki biovulf main grandal ke paatr kaa varnan bliculing homilies ke homili 16 main narak par saint paul ke vichaar se liya gaya tha
 Icelandic scholar Grimmer Johnson Throcklein, working under the Danish Government's Historical Research Commission, first transcribed the manuscript in 1786 and published it in 1815
 ek ko unhone khud pratilekith kiya or doosraa anglo-sexon nahin jaanane vaale peshewar pratilekhakon se karavaaya
 us samay ke baad se, pandulipi ko kai baar todaa maroda gaya, phir bhi throkaleen kaa pratilekhan biovulf vidwaanon ke liye ek bahumoolya madhyamik strot bana hua he
 These transcripts can be attributed to around 2000 papers

 haalanki iskaa lekhak agyaat he, lekin iske vishay or vishay saamagree ke mul anglon-sexon parampara main nihit or scoops dwaara jote gaye europea vir kavitaaon se milte hai
 There are differing views on whether the poem is composed in sync with its transcription, or that the poem was composed in an earlier period and has been transmitted orally for many years
 ne mahasoos kiya ki pandulipi pradarshan ke pratilekhan ko prastut karte hai, haalanki sambhawatah ek baithak se adhik par liye gaye honge
 Kieran has argued on the basis of paleographical and codicological evidence that the poem is contemporary with the manuscript
 keayrnan kaa tark atyadhik charchit kavita ke rajnatik prasang ke bhaag se mail khaataa he: adhikansh vidwaanon nen bhi haal hi main kaha he ki kavita 8veen sadi main likhi gai thi or iskaa anumaan unhone is aadhaar par lagaaya he ki kavita main dens ke liye atyadhik sahanubhuti dikhaai gai he or iske 9veen or 10veen sadi main viking ke yug ke dauraan anglo-sexon dwaara likhe jane kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 Kiernan's arguments are against the origins of the 8th century, since it also requires that the poem be transcribed in the Viking era by the anglo-saxon, paleographical and codicological evidence that promotes the belief that Beowulf is an 11th-century composite
 There is a poem and it is said that a and Clerk b were writers and Clerk b was more poignant of the two

 Kimbly identified the character of Hawke's son, Hanaf, with Hnobi, the son of the historical almighty Nobleman Höchting, and worked on an earlier issue based on Frisia as early as 800 AD

 The question of whether Beowulf has ever indulged in any oral tradition before his current manuscript is a matter of debate for centuries and includes many more questions than how it was produced
 balki, yah maukhik-sutrit sanrachana or maukhik parampara ke siddhant kaa aashay detaa he, prashn yah he ki kavita ko kaise samajha jaae or kis prakaar kii vyakhya kii aavashyaktaa he
 The scholarly discussion on Beowulf in the context of oral tradition was highly active in the 1960s and 1970s
 bahes ko is prakaar dekha ja saktaa he: ek ore, ham kavita kaa nayak se sambandhit kai kahaniyaan ko ekasaath laakar anumaan laga sakate hai
 These pieces will be kept for many years due to tradition and it will be imparted apprenticeship to the poets of the next generation
 The poem is written orally without any preparation and is a traditional epigraphy, attracting oral, pagan, German, heroic and tribal people
 duusari ore, kuch log maanate hai ki yah kavita kisi sakshar lipic dwaara likhi gai he, jo latin sikhte-sikhte sakshar hua tha, sambhawatah koi bhikshu yaa gahare drushtikon vaala isai ho saktaa he
 On this side, pagan references would be some method of ornamental epigraphy
 tisare vichaar ke anusaar upar ullekith donon bahes sahi hai or yah unhen jodne kaa ek prayaas he, isliye inhen paraspar virdohi ke rup main vyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa; iske anusaar kavita ke kaary main ek se adhik isai or ek se adhik butaparast kii bhaavana, jo ki kai sau varshon se ek duusare se alag ho chuke hai, kii jhalak maujuud he; iskaa kahana he ki kavita multah ek sakshar isai lekhak dwaara likhi gai he, jise butaparasti kaa gyaan tha or ho saktaa he ki uske purvaj butaparast rahe hon or usne apana dharm badal liya ho, ek aisa kavi jo maukhik or sakshar lipic donon main paarangat tha or jo maukhik parampara kii kavita kaa "punarnirmaan" karne main sakasham tha; is aarambhik isai kavi ne nyaay ke liye apana balidaan dene kii ichha or zaruratmandon kii sahaayta or suraksha karne ke prayaason or mahanatam suraksha ko apni ankho se dekha tha; achche butaparast vyaktiyon ko sahi raste kaa chunaav karte hue dekha tha or isliye is kavi ne dhairya or sammaan ke saath butaparast samskruti ko prastut kiya tha; phir bhi is praarambhik isai kavi kii rachana or bahut baad main rachiyata "fire-and-brimestone", ek isai kavi jo butaparast abhyaas ko andhere or paap kii sangya detaa he or jisane iske daanvon ke shaitani pahaluon ko joda he

 Abrams and Stephen Greenblatt introduce Beowulf in the Norton anthology of English literature, stating that, "the poet revived the pagan world of Virgatha's language, style and ancient European oral poetry
 It was widely Beowulf is believed to be the creation of a single poet who was a Christian and his poetry reflects the Christian tradition
 haalanki, crown di

 In his historical work, the proverbial singer, Albert refers to the works of Lord Francis P
 Mogon and others, stating that "the documentation is complete, documented, and accurate"
 This complete analysis is sufficient to prove that Beowulf's composition was oral
 biovulf or anya anglo-sexon kavita kii maukhik-sutrit rachana ke liye kii gai pariksha ke mishrit parinaam hai
 While "themes" exist in anglo-saxon and other European works, some scholars argue that poems are composed on a word-by-word basis and following many formulas and methodologies
 laire benson ne tark diya he ki biovulf kii vyakhya ek sampurna sutrit kaary ke rup main karne se pathak kii kshamta iskaa vishleshan karne main nasht ho jaati he ki kavita ekikrut rup main likhi gai he or ve kavi kii rachanaatmakataa par dhyaan kendrit nahin kar pate hai
 Instead, he proposed that other passages in German literature contain "elements of tradition" from which Beowulf is quoted and elaborated
 kuch saal baad, enn wats ne ek pustak prakashit kii, jisamen unhone anglo-sexon kavita ke liye paaramparik, homer, maukhik-sutrit siddhant ko apurna bataaya he
 He has also argued that the two traditions cannot be compared and therefore should not be done
 thomas gardenar wats se sahamat the, chaar varsh pehle prakashit hue samachaarpatr main unhone tark diya tha ki biovulf paath vividh pravriti kaa he or iskaa nirmaan purna rup se sutron or vishyon dwaara he
 John Miles Foley has specifically stated in the context of the Beowulf debate that, while comparative work is both necessary and valid, it must be organized with the particularities of the given traditions; Foley argues, given the development of oral traditional theory, not to speculate nor rely on unverified conjecture about composition, and not to focus on oral / written assumptions in favor of the unconstrained tradition and textuality
 Do it antat, ursula skifer ke vichaar main, kavita "maukhik" yaa "likhit" thi, yah sawaal kuch-kuch red hering kii tarah ho jaataa he
 In this model, the poem is composed and is interpretable within both mental horizons
 skifer kii "maukhik" avadharana na to kisi samjhaute or na hi vichaaron ke sanyog ko prastaavit karti he jo kavita ko ek ore europea, butaparast or maukhik maanate hai or duusari ore use latin se uddhrut, isai yaa sakshar maanate hai, lekin jaisaa ki monica otter kaa kahana he: "


 'rupee kaa ek sikaa', maukhik or sakshar donon samskritiyon main milte hai or donon ke hi apane tark or saundarya hai

 yahi vah tathy he jo kuch vidwaanon ko yah vishwaas karne ke liye prerit karata he ki biovulf kii lambii or jatil sancharan sabhi mukhya boli ke kshetron ke madhyam main kiya gaya he
 The poem has a complex mixture of the following dialects: Mercian, Northumberian, Early Western Saxon, Cantish, and Last Western Saxon
 Kiernan argues that it is almost impossible that a process of transmission would have occurred at the time by which this complex mixture of generation and generation from clerical to dialect was maintained
 prapatron ke mishran par aadhaarit aarambhik dinaankan ke viruddh keayrnan kaa tark lanbaa he or sammilit he, lekin usne nishkarsh nikaala ki prapatron kaa mishran likhit paath ke tulanaatmak rup se sidhe itihaas ko nimna rup main ingit kiya gaya ho saktaa he:

 An Old English poem like Beowulf is very different from a modern poem
 anglo-sexon kavi vishisht anupras chand kaa upyog karte the, jo ki chand kaa ek aisa rup he jisamen anupras kaa upyog kavita kii panktiyon ko ekikrut karne ke liye mukhya sanrachanaatmak upkaran ke rup main kiya jaataa he, anya upkarnon jaise tukbandi ke sthaan par

 Additionally, the two parts are divided into one Yeti: "off scaled safe \ \ scipina pretum" and the ligature "cg" is pronounced like "dj", as in the word "edge"
 The pronunciation of both f and s varies depending on their phonetic environment
 swar yaa vyanjan ke bich, aadhunik v or z kii tarah sunai dene vaali awaajen hoti hai
 Otherwise they remain silent, such as f in modern "fat" and s in "sat"
 Some letters that are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, þ and eth, ð — both represent the pronunciation of modern English "th" in "cloth" and "clothe" —are used in the original manuscript and modern English versions
 Has been widely used in
 in varnon kii aawaaj f or s kii tarah pratidhwani hai
 Both are vowels and are between other vowel sounds: oðer, laþleas, suþern
 Otherwise they are dissatisfied: þunor, suð, soþfæst
 biovulf main caning bhi ek mahatvapurn takanic he
 They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often constructed to meet the needs of alliteration in verse
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek kavi samudr ko "swaan-road" kah saktaa he yaa yaa phir "whale-road"; ek raja ko "ring-giver" kaha ja saktaa he
 Beowulf has many kennings and the instrument is a typical classic poem in Old English, with many formulas
 kavita main swar kaa lop karne vaale rupakalankar kaa vyapak upyog bhi kiya jaataa he
 JRR Tolkien argues that the poem is an elegy

 Alan Cabanis argues that there are many similarities between Beowulf and the Bible
 pehle usne biovulf or yishu ke bich samaantaaon ke liye tark diya ki: donon apane pratidwandi daanvon ke par kaabo paane main bahadur or niswaarthee hai or donon hi aise raja the, jinhone apane logon ko bachaane ke liye apni jaan kii qurbaani de di
 doosraa, unhone da book of revelation ke bhaag or grandal or grandal kii maan ke ghar ke bich samanaataaon ke liye tark diya he
 Third, he compared Jesus' words in the Gospel of Luke to that part of the poem when Beowulf forgives his foe Anforth
 haalanki, vidwaan kavita ke arth or pravriti se asahmat hai: kya yah ek isai kaary tha jo europea butaparast sandarbh main kiya gaya tha? prashn suzav detaa he ki europea butaparast vishwaason ke roopantaran se isai logon dwaara kiya gaya kaary bahut dhimaa or kai sadiyon tak chalane vaali nir6tar prakriya thi or kavita likhe jate samay dharmik vishwaas ke sandarbh main kavita ke sandesh kii pravriti param aspasht bani hui he
