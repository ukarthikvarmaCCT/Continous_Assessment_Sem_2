 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced

 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance

 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers

 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship

 hyderabad shahar main bhu-mafia kii napak gatividhiyaan charam par hai
 Two rival gangs are active here; One of the gangsters is Ali Bhai, who stays in Dubai, handles the activities here through his brothers Ajju and Mona and the gang leader is a local Gunda Narayan
 Both these gangs threaten builders and landowners and by forcefully, extortion or killing them acquire money or property in the name of protection
 said hyderabad kaa nayaa ayukta banakar aata he or aparaadh ko kuchalanaa shuru karata he
 Pandu is a thug who is abducted by a gang member and his loyal Mallesh
 pandu ne narayan se mahesh ko haraane kaa sauda kiya tha or usne vaisaa hi kiya
 Ajju invites Pandu to join Ali Bhai's gang
 pandu inkaar karte hue kahata he ki vah kisi giroh ke liye kaam nahin karata lekin achche paise milane par vah kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 Pandu falls in love with Shruthi's cousin when he goes to aerobics class, but by mistake Shruthi considers him a thug
 shruthi, ek college kii chaatra he jo apni vidhwaa maa or chote bhai ke saath rahati he
 Brahmi lives upstairs in Shruthi's house and he always tries to convince Shruthi to marry himself
 sab inspector pashupathi, us colony kaa ek bhrasht adhikari he jahaan pandu or shruthi rahete hai or vah aksar bhu-mafia ke liye kaam karata he
 He also gets money from Ali Bhai
 vah shruthi ko pasand karne lagata he or use apni rakhel banane kaa faisla karata he
 On behalf of the Ali gang, Pandu is tasked to kill a member of the Narayan gang, as his first assignment
 haalanki, us jagah par police pahunch jaati he jahaan pandu or anya apradhi intjaar kar rahe hote hai
 Pandu confuses the police for a long time so that others can finish their work and run away
 He also helps Shruthi so that he can escape from the animal path
 She is impressed by his kindness and begins to create romantic feelings between them without saying
 jab shruthi apni bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karne kii koshish karti he, tab narayan giroh ke sadsy un par hamalaa kar dete hai, jinhen pandu khatm kar detaa he
 Shruthi is shocked to learn that Pandu is a criminal and has no regrets about killing people
 pashupathi kuch aise thagon kaa intjaam karata he jo shruthi kaa balaatkaar karne kaa naatak karen jisase koi sabhy parivaar use apane ghar kii bahu na bananaa chaahe; or is tarah se shruthi or uski maa ke paas uski sharton ko maanane ke alaava koi vikalp na rah jaye
 pandu ko jab iske bare main pataa chalata he tab vah pashupathi ko buree tarah se martha he or use chetavanee detaa he ki agar is ghatana ke liye vah jimmedaar sabit hua to vah uske liye bahut bura hoga
 Ali Khan comes to Hyderabad and kills Narayan
 baad main vah pandu se miltaa he or gubbaaraa phodkar ek mantri ko maarane kii sajeesh karata he
 Pandu disagrees with this method of Ali Bhai as it is also feared to have killed innocent people
 jab unke bich tark chal rahaa hota he usee samay police club main chapa maarthi he or ali bhai ko giraftaar kar leti he
 His gang members take revenge by making a pornographic video of the police commissioner's daughter and releasing it to the media

 Bead kite or 'dragon fly' is an insect
 isaki badi ankhen, do jodi majboot paardarshee pankh or helicopter jaisaa lambaa sharir isaki mukhya visheshta hai
 Like other insects, they have six legs but cannot walk properly
 jaisaa shri shivaditya ne saptapadaarthi naamak granth main likhaa he sanshay anishchit gyaan yaa sandigdh anubhav ko kehete hai
 According to logic, doubt is the knowledge in which the same substance appears to contain many opposing religions or qualities
 udaahranarth, jab ham andhere main kisi duurastha stambh ko dekhakar nishchit rup se yah nahin jaan pate ki vah stambh he to hamaara man dolyman ho jaataa he or ham us ek ko padaarth main stambhatv evam manushyatv do vibhinn dharmon kaa aarope karne lagate hai
 Neither can we say with certainty that matter is a pillar nor that it is a human being
 man kii aisi hi vipratipattiyukt, dwividhagrast, nishchayrahit yaa vikalpatmak avasthaa ko sanshay kaha jaataa he
 This state is not only different from knowledge and illusion or contrary knowledge, but also from actual definite knowledge
 at: sanshaywad, naamak siddhant ke anusaar nishcitt gyaan athwa uski sambhaavna kaa nishedh kiya jaataa he
 According to the views of the people who follow this principle fully, human beings can never have any real or definite knowledge of any kind
 sanshaywaadiyon kii raay main hamaare mastishk yaa man kii banaavat hi aisi he ki uske dwaara ham kabhi bhi sansar ke yaa uske padaarthon ke sahi swaroop ko avgat kar sakane main samarth nahin ho sakate
 Skepticism is called Scapticism in Anglo language
 scapticism kaa shriganesh isa ke purv san 440 main yunaan desh ke sophist kahalaanevaale tarkpradhan vyaktiyon se hua batalaaya jaataa he
 But his skepticism was normal
 suvyavasthit siddhant ke rup main to iskaa aarambh elis ke piro naamak prakhyat vichaarak se, isa ke teen sau varsh purv, hua
 Piro describes real knowledge as impossible in clear terms
 philiyas kaa timen uskaa pramukh shishy tha
 Some of Piro's followers, including the name of Sextus Empiricus, are particularly notable, to the extent of skeptical belief that they themselves began to see this latter as skeptical
 in sanshaywaadiyon ke anusaar ichchhaaon or niraashaaon se samudbhoot hamaare saare hi du:khon kii utpatti padaarth vishyak hamaare paramarsho kii apramanita se hi hoti he
 Among medieval Western skeptics, Pascal and Hume are more famous in modern skeptics
 pascal kaa kahana tha ki sansar sambandhi koi bhi nishchit yaa santoshprad siddhant buddhi dwaara sthapit nahin kiya ja saktaa or hum mahoday ne hamaari jaanane kii kshamta ko keval anubhavik kshetra tak hi simit batalaaya he
 According to him, man has no right to know or say anything outside his sensory experience
 koi koi vichaarasmeekshak prasiddh german darshanik kaant ko bhi sanshaywaadiyon main shaamil kar lete hai; parantu unhen sanshaywaadee na kahkar agyeyavaadee kahana adhik upyukt he, kyonki unhone vastuon ke vaastavik yaa parmaarthik swaroop ko agyeya yaa buddhi dwaara agamya batalaaya he, sandehaaspad nahin
 And at least they have considered the ability to understand the work force
 bharatvarsh ke kuch sanshaywaadiyon kaa ullekh "shramanyafalsutra" aadi kuch buddha granthon main miltaa he
 For example, a thinker named Ajitakesakambali said that true knowledge is never possible and the author of the manuscript titled "tattavopallav Singh" published in the Gaekwad Oriental Series, Mr
 Jayarashi, did not consider any evidence, even direct evidence, to be a means of unquestionable knowledge
 
 kabhi-kabhi kuch log "syadasti syat naasti" aadi shabdon dwaara pratipaadit jain darshan ke syadwad kaa bhi sanshaywad samajhane lagate hai
 But in fact, the use of the word "syat", rendered sycophantic, does not imply the skepticism of the sentence, but it refers to the relativity of truth
 swaadwad ko paramarshon yaa nirnyo kaa satyatv, paristhiti evam prasanganukool, sweekaarya he
 Regardless of what the skeptics themselves say, the mental state of skepticism is not a state of happiness
 or purna rup se sanshaywaadee hona atyant kathin hi nahin, kintu asambhav he
 The acceptance of skepticism itself refutes its belief
 yadi kisi bhi prakaar kaa nishchit gyaan nahin ho saktaa, to phir yah nishchay rup se kaise kaha ja saktaa he ki kisi bhi prakaar kaa nishchit gyaan sambhav nahin
 Either skepticism is irreducible or skepticism itself proves to be corrupted by "stigma defect"
 iske atirikt, hamaare vyaavhaarik jivan kaa ek ek kaary tatsambandhi padaarth yaa vyakti ke nishchit gyaan kii manyata par nirbhar rahata he
 He cannot walk on accepting skepticism completely
 isiilie to shrimadbhagavadgita main "sanshayatma vinashyati" aadi shabdon dwaara sanshaywad ko agrahya tehraaya he
 But, at the same time, it cannot be denied that blind acceptance of untested traditional beliefs also hinders the development of ideas
 at: kabhi kabhi saamaanya rup se sweekrut tathakthith satyon ko andeh kii drushti se dekhnaa bhi gyanavriddhi ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he jaisaa bhamtikar shri vachaspati mishra ne kaha he, sanshay jigyaasa ko janm detaa he or jigyaasa to gyaan ke liye vaanchhneeya he hi
 And Kant sir's assertion that Hume's "skepticism woke me from the slumber of ideological stereotypes" proves this truth
 parantu buddhi yaa man ko sanshay rupi rang se purnataya rang lenaa or prayek baat par andeh karnaa thik vaisaa hi he jaisaa haathon main mile na hone par bhi kisi pagal dwaara unka satat or nirantar dhoyaa janaa

 In connection with advocacy, he first went to Ranikhet and then went to Kashipur and formed an institution called Prem Sabha, which was aimed at generating awareness about education and literature
 is sanstha kaa kaary itnaa vyapak tha ki british skulon ne kashipur se apana boria bistar baandhane main hi kheriyat samajhi
 In December 1921, he ventured into open politics through the non-cooperation movement on the call of Gandhiji

 From around the 13th century onwards, in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, "sant Mat" was a loosely connected group of gurus that gained much fame
 dharm brahm vigyaan ke taur par unki shikshaaon kii visheshta yah he ki ve antarmukhi or prem bhakthi ke ek divine siddhant se jude hai or saamaajik rup se ve ek samtawadi gunon vaale siddhant se jude hai jo hindu dharm kii jati pratha ke viruddh he or hindu - muslim ke antar ke bhi viruddh he
 The saint tradition can be broadly divided into two groups: Punjab, the northern group of saints of the region who expressed themselves mainly in colloquial Hindi and the southern group whose language is ancient Marathi and is represented by Namdev and other saints from Maharashtra
 
 'sant mat' kaa arth he - 'santon kaa maarg', 'satya kaa maarg', 'sahi or ashaavadi path' yaa 'santon kii raay'
 'sant' shabd sanskrit kii dhaatu 'sad' se bana he or kai prakaar se prayog haa he 
 iskaa mul arth he 'satya jaanane vaala' yaa 'jisane antim satya anubhav kar liya ho
 The meaning of the word "saint" is generally taken from a good person, but its special meaning is taken only from the saint poets of medieval India
 sant mat andolan ekarup nahin tha or isamen santon kaa apana saamaajik-dharmik vyavhaar shaamil tha jo ki hajaar varsh pehle bhagavadgita main varnit bhakthi par aadhaarit tha
 He shared some of his own traditions with each other and followers of the traditions he challenged
 is prakaar sant mat vishisht dharmik parampara ke bajaay aadhyatmik vyaktitvon kaa aisa vividhtapurna samooh prathit hota he jo ek saamaanya aadhyatmik mul ko sweekaar karata he
 The boundaries of this movement were probably not sectarian and it did not even have Brahmin concepts of caste and method of worship
 sant kaviyon ne apni vaani bolchaal kii bhashaa main likhe kavy main kahi jo unhone hindi or marathi jaisi sthaneey bhashaaon main saamaanya jan ko sambodhit kii
 He called the name Ishwar a true protector and rejected religious values as priceless
 unhone is vichaar ko sthapit kiya ki dharm, ishwar ke prati samarpan kaa vishay he jo ki hriday main basataa he

 The tradition of Ramanandi monks tells the story of Ramananda differently by other saints and later Sikhs
 itani jaankaree milti he ki ramanand ne sabhi jatiyon se shishy sweekaar kiye, yah ek aisa tathy he jiskaa roodhiwaadee hinduon ne us samay virodh kiya tha
 The followers of Sant Mat believe that Ramananda's disciples prepared the first generation of saints
 in santon ne ek sankruti kaa vikaas kiya jo samaaj main haashie par pade manushyon ke nikat thi jisamen mahilaayein, dalit, achhut or atishudra shaamil the
 Some of the more famous saints include Namdev, Kabir, Nanak, Surdas, Meera Bai, Tulsidas and Tukaram
 
 The tradition of saints has been non-denominational, although many saint poets are believed to have established their sects
 inamen se kaiyon ke naam ke saath sant judaa he lekin unke shishyon ne aage chal kar kabir panth, dadu panth, dariyaa panth, advait mat, aadhyatmikta kaa vigyaan or radhaswami jaise panth chalaae
 Only a minority of religious Hindus have formally followed the saintly faith
 parantu is parampara kaa sabhi sampradaayon or jatiyon par bahut prabhaav pada he
 The hymns of bygone saints like Meera Bai are widely heard in Hindu castes in India and around the world

 Lane has described Fakir's statement of 'not knowing' as 'chandian influence' concerning the manifestation of Baba Fakir Chand's divine form
 fakir ne ise anuyaayiyon ke man kaa hi khel kaha or rup prakat hone ko maaya bataaya
 This breaks many assumptions of saintliness
 guru maharaj ji or divine lite mishan ko je
 gordan melton, lusi du partiz or vishaal mangalwari sant mat parampara kaa maanate hai parantu ron greaves is lakshan-varnan ke virdohi hai

 saraswati ek puranic nadi jisaki charchaa vedon main bhi he
 The Rigveda describes Saraswati as Annavati and Udkavati
 yah nadi sarvada jal se bhari rahati thi or iske kinare ann kii prachur utpatti hoti thi
 It is said that this river, originating from the mountainous part of Sirmur state in Punjab and passing through Ambala and Kurukshetra, entered the Karnal district and Patiala state and merged with the Drishadvati river in Sirsa district
 pracheen kaal main is sammilit nadi ne raajapootaana ke anek sthalon ko jalsikt kar diya tha
 It is also said that this shape up to near Prayag became a triveni in the Ganges and Yamuna
 kalantar main yah in sab sthanon se tirohit ho gai, phir bhi logon kii dharna he ki prayag main vah ab bhi ant:salila hokar bahati he
 It is clear from Manushahita that the terrain between Saraswati and Drishdwati was called Brahmavarta
 jai sree ram River Saraswati is one of the main Hindu rivers and the main rivers mentioned in the Rigveda
 rugveda ke nadi sookt ke ek mantra main saraswati nadi ko 'yamuna ke purv' or 'sutluj ke pashchim' main bahati hui bataaya gaya he uttar vaidic granthon, jaise tandya or jaimineey brahman main saraswati nadi ko marusthal main sookhaa hua bataaya gaya he, mahabharatamen bhi saraswati nadi ke marusthal main 'vinaashan' naamak jagah par vilupt hone kaa varnan aata he
 In the Mahabharata, the Plakshavati River, Vedasmriti, Vedavati etc
 of Saraswati River have many names
 mahabharat, vayupurana adi main saraswati ke vibhinn putron ke naam or unase jude myth praapt hote hai
 In the Mahabharata, shanti-parva, shanti-parva, or Vayu Purana, myths related to the Saraswati river and the son of Dadhichi Rishi meet with slight differences, he has been extended by Sanskrit Mahakavi Banabhatta in his book 'harshacharitha'
 vah likhte hen- " ek baar baarah varsh tak varsha na hone ke kaaran rishigan saraswati kaa kshetra tyaag kar idhar-udhar ho gaye, parantu mata ke aadesh par saraswati-putr, saraswatey vahaan se kahin nahin gaya
 Then, when the sage returned, when he had a drought, he had forgotten all the Vedas etc
 unke aagrah kaa maan rakhte hue saraswatey ne unhen shishy rup main sweekaar kiya or punah shrutiyon kaa paath karavaaya
 ashwaghosh ne apane 'buddhacharit'kavy main bhi isi katha kaa varnan kiya he
 In the third chapter of 'kavyamimamsa', a famous tenth scholar Rajasekhar has given a poetic myth that when Saraswati meditated on the Himalayas with the desire to have a son, Brahma pleased and created a son named for him
 - poetry man
 As soon as Kavipurusha is born, she says in the prayer of Mata Saraswati in the verse - o Mother, i pray your son Kavyapurusha, by which the entire universe is transformed into meaning
 

" Based on the references to the Saraswati river in the Rig Veda and other mythological Vedic texts, many geologists believe that the existing dry ghaggar-hakra river flowing through Rajasthan from Haryana was a main tributary of the ancient Vedic Saraswati river, which dates back to 5000-3000
 BCE flowed all over
 us samay sutluj tathaa yamuna kii kuch dharaaen saraswati nadi main aa kar milti thim
 Apart from this, two other missing rivers, Sarswadi and Hiranyavati were also tributaries of Saraswati, Yamuna, Satluj changed its course due to geological changes till about 1900 BCE and Saraswati river also disappeared as Sravasti river dried up in 2600 BCE
 It is done
 rugveda main saraswati nadi ko nadeetama kii oopaadhi di gayi he
 Saraswati was the largest and main river in Vedic civilization
 isro dwaara kiye gayi shodh se pataa chalaa he ki aaj bhi yah nadi haryana, punjab or rajasthan se hoti hui bhumigat rup main pravaahman he
 Saraswati was a huge river
 pahaado ko todatii hui nikalati thi or maidaanon se hoti hui arab sagar main jaakar villin ho jaati thi
 Its description appears repeatedly in the Rigveda
 kai mandalon main iskaa varnan he
 It always had water in the Rigveda Vedic period
 saraswati aaj kii ganga kii tarah us samay kii vishaltam nadiyon main se ek thi
 During the later Vedic period and Mahabharata period this river had dried up a lot
 tab saraswati nadi main pani bahut kam tha
 But during the rainy season it used to get water
 bhugarbhi badlaav kii vajah se saraswati nadi kaa pani ganga main chalaa gaya, kai vidwaan maanate hai ki isi vajah se ganga ke pani kii mahima hui, bhuuchaal aane ke kaaran jab jameen upar uthi to saraswati kaa pani yamuna main gir gaya
 Therefore, the water of Saraswati also started flowing in the Yamuna
 sirf isiilie prayag main teen nadiyon kaa sangam mana gaya, jabaki yatharth main vahaan teen nadiyon kaa sangam nahin he
 There are only two rivers
 saraswati kabhi bhi elahabaad tak nahin pahaunchi
 The later Vedic literature of the Rigveda mentions the extinction of the Saraswati river, besides the origin of the Saraswati river has been identified as 'plaksha Prasravan', which is situated near Yamunotri
 mahabharat main mili varnan ke anusaar saraswati nadi haryana main yamunanagar se thodaa upar or shivalik pahadiyon se thodaa sa neeche adibadri naamak sthaan se nikalati thi
 Even today people consider this place as a place of pilgrimage and go there
 kintu aaj adibadri naamak sthaan se bahane vaali nadi bahut dur tak nahin jaati ek patali dhara kii tarah jagah-jagah dikhaai dene vaali is nadi ko hi log saraswati kah dete hai
 According to the description of Vedic and Mahabharata period, on the banks of this river was Brahmavarta, Kurukshetra, but today there are reservoirs
 jab nadi sookhti he to jahaan-jahaan pani gaharaa hota he, vahaan-vahaan talab yaa jhilein rah jaati hai or ye talab or jhilein ardhdachandrakaar shakl main paayi jaati hai
 Even today, such crescent-shaped ponds are seen in Brahmasarovar or Pehwa in Kurukshetra, but these too have dried up
 lekin ye sarovar pramaan hai ki us sthaan par kabhi koi vishaal nadi bahati rahi thi or uske sookhne ke baad vahaan vishaal jhilein ban gayin
 According to the Archaeological Council of India, Saraswati originated from a glacier named Rupana in Uttaranchal
 rupan glacier ko ab saraswati glacier bhi kaha jane laga he
 On coming to Naitwar, it used to be converted into glacial water, then Saraswati used to flow to Adibadri in the form of water and go ahead
 vaigyanik or bhugarbheey khojon se pataa chalaa he ki kisi samay is kshetra main bheeshan bhucamp aae, jiske kaaran jameen ke neeche ke pahaad upar uth gaye or saraswati nadi kaa jal peeche kii ore chalaa gaya
 There is also a description of another river Drishdwati in Vedic period
 yah saraswati nadi kii sahaayak nadi thi
 It also flowed through Haryana
 kalantar main jab bheeshan bhucamp aae or haryana tathaa rajasthan kii dharti ke neeche pahaad upar uthe, to nadiyon ke bahaav kii disha badal gai
 The Drishadwati River, a tributary of the Saraswati River, began to flow north and east
 isi drushadwati ko ab yamuna kaha jaataa he, iskaa itihaas 4,000 varsh purv mana jaataa he
 Yamuna was earlier a tributary of Chambal
 bahut baad main yah elahabaad main ganga se jaakar mili
 This was the period when the water of Saraswati also got into the Yamuna
 rugveda kaal main saraswati samudr main girti thi
 As has been said above, Saraswati never reached Prayag
 bhuuchaal aane ke kaaran jab jameen upar uthi to saraswati kaa pani yamuna main gir gaya
 Therefore, the water of Saraswati along with Yamuna started flowing in the Yamuna
 sirf isiilie prayag main teen nadiyon kaa sangam mana gaya jabaki bhugarbheey yatharth main vahaan teen nadiyon kaa sangam nahin he
 There are only two rivers
 saraswati kabhi bhi elahabaad tak nahin pahunchi
 The civilization settled on the banks of the river Saraswati, called the Harappan civilization or the indus-saraswati civilization, if it is removed from the Vedic hymns, then the Saraswati river will remain just a river, the civilization will end
 sabhyataa kaa itihaas bataata he ki saraswati nadi tat par basii bastiyon se mili avshesh tathaa in avasheshon kii kahani keval hadappa sabhyataa se judati he
 Of the 2600 settlements of the Harappan civilization, there are only 265 settlements on the Indus coast in present-day Pakistan, while most of the remaining settlements are found on the banks of the Saraswati River
 abhi tak hadappa sabhyataa ko sirf sindhu nadi kii dein mana jaataa rahaa tha, lekin ab naye shodhon se siddh ho gaya he ki saraswati kaa sindhu sabhyataa ke nirmaan main bahut bada yogadan tha

 These businessmen attempt to forecast disaster forecasts and take necessary precautions
 janashakti, vitt or anya aadharbhoot samarthan aapadaa prabandhan kii up-shakha kaa hi hissaa hai
 Post-disaster conditions are an important basis of disaster management
 jab aapadaa ke kaaran sab kuch ast-vyast ho jaataa he tab logon ko swayan hi ujde jivan ko pun: basaanaa hota he tathaa apane din-pratidin ke kaary pun: shuru karne padate hai
 Disaster managers have to work to restore normal life in such affected areas
 aapadaa prabandhan vyavsaayik samanvayak ke rup main kaary karata he
 This ensures that all necessary aids and facilities are available at the right time in a disaster-prone area, causing the least damage
 yah prabandhak aise visheshgy logon ke samooh kaa mukhiya hota he, jinaki sevaayen aapadaa ke samay anivaary hoti hai
 Such as doctors, nurses, civil engineers, telecommunications specialists, architects, electricians etc

 Rama is recognized as an incarnation of God in ancient India
 hindu dharm main ram vishnu ke das avtaron main se saatven avatar hai

 goswami tulsidas ne bhi unke jivan par kendrit bhakthibhaavpurn suprasiddh mahakavy shri ramcharitamanas kii rachana kii he
 Apart from these two, Ramayana has also been composed in other Indian languages, which are also very famous
 khaas taur par uttar bharat main ram atyant poojyaneey hai or adarsh purush hai
 They are also embellished with the term Purushottam
 ram, ayodhya ke raja dasharath or rani kaushalya ke sabase bade putr the

 ram kii pratishtha maryaada purushottam ke rup main he
 Rama left the kingdom, friends, parents, even wife to follow decorum

 Ram was born in Raghukul, whose tradition was that of Pran Jahun Baru Bachnu Na Jai
 shriram ke pita dasharath ne unki sauteli mata kaikeyi ko unki kinhin do ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kaa vachan diya tha
 Kaikeyi came under the guise of maid Manthara as these vars asked King Dasaratha for his son Bharata for the throne of Ayodhya and fourteen years of exile for Rama
 pita ke vachan kii raksha ke liye ram ne khushi se chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas sweekaar kiya
 Wife Sita thought it appropriate to go to the forest with her husband, giving the example of the ideal wife
 bhai lakshmana ne bhi ram ke saath chaudaa varsh van main bitaye
 Bharata rejects Mata's order for justice and goes to the elder brother Rama in the forest and brings him to his feet
 phir ise hi raaj gaddi par rakh kar rajkaaj kiya
 When Ram was a forest dweller, his wife Sita took Ravana away

 His two sons Kush and Love handled their kingdoms
 hindu dharm ke kai tyohaar, jaise dashahra, ram navami or deepawali, ram kii jivan-katha se jude hue hai
 The word 'ram' is derived from the addition of the suffix 'ghan' in 'rum' metal
 'ram' dhaatu kaa arth raman karne se sambaddh he
 They 'raman' in the heart of a creature, therefore 'ram' and devotees 'raman' in them, therefore they are also 'ram'
 'vishnusahasranam' par likhit apane bhashya main aadya shankaracharya ne padmapurana kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki nityanandswarup bhagavan main yogijan raman karte hai, isliye ve 'ram' hai
 Rama is not mentioned in Vedic literature in the prevailing form
 rugveda main keval do sthalon par hi 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 One of them has been used in the meaning of black in one place and the remaining one in the meaning of person; But there is also no indication of his being an avatar man or Dasaratha-son
 yadhyapi nilkanth chaturdhar ne rugveda ke anek mantron ko swavivek se chunakar unke ramakthaparak arth kiye hai, parantu yah unki nijee manyata he
 The Ramakathaparaka meaning of those mantras has not been proved by any indication or any other commentary received in those cases of Rigveda itself
 rugveda main ek sthal par 'ikshvakuh' kaa tathaa ek sthal par 'dasharath' shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But there is no indication of his association with Rama
 brahman sahitya main 'ram' shabd kaa prayog aitarey brahman main do sthalon par hua he; parantu vahaan unhen 'raamo margveyah' kaha gaya he, jiskaa arth acharya sayan ke anusaar 'mrigavu' naamak stri kaa putr he
 The word 'ram' is used at a place in the Shatapatha Brahmin
 yahan 'ram' yajna ke acharya ke rup main he tathaa unhen 'ram auptpasvini' kaha gaya he
 This means that the incarnation of the prevalent Rama is due to the Valmiki Ramayana and the Puranas

 Here only the position of Jupiter and Moon are clear
 brihaspati ucchsth he tathaa chandramaa swagruhi
 Further in the fifteenth verse, the Sun is mentioned to be high
 is prakaar brihaspati tathaa surya ke ucch hone kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Mercury is always near the Sun
 atah surya ke ucch hone par buddha kaa ucch hona asambhav he
 In this way, the remaining three planets - Mars, Venus and Saturn are left to grow higher
 isi kaaran se praayah sabhi vidwaanon ne ram-janm ke samay main surya, mangal, brihaspati, shukr tathaa shani ko ucch main sthit mana he
 Traditionally, Rama's birth is believed to be in Treta Yuga
 hindu dharamshastron main, visheshtah puranic sahitya main uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar ek chaturyugi main 43,20,000 varsh hote hai, jinamein kaliyug ke 4,32,000 varsh tathaa dwapar ke 8,64,000 varsh hote hai
 Rama was born in Treta Yug i
e
 before Dwapara
 chunki kaliyug kaa abhi prarambh hi hua he or ram kaa janm treta ke ant main hua tathaa avatar lekar dharti par unke vartmaan rahane kaa samay paramparaagat rup se 11,000 varsh mana gaya he
 Hence 8,64,000 years of Dwapara Yuga + 11,000 years of Rama's existence + 5,100 years since the end of Dwapara Yuga = 8,80,100 years in total
 atev paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 8,80,100 varsh pehle mana jaataa he
 Eminent Marathi researcher scholar Dr
 Padmakar Vishnu Vartak has considered this time probable from a point of view
 unka kahana he ki valmikiy ramayana main ek sthal par vindhyachal tathaa himalay kii oonchaai ko samaan bataaya gaya he
 The height of Vindhyachal is 5,000 feet and it is almost constant, while the height of the Himalayas is currently 29,029 feet and it is continuously growing
 donon kii oonchaai kaa antar 24,029 feet he
 According to experts, the Himalayas grow 3 feet in 100 years
 atah 24,029 feet badhane main himalay ko kareeb 8,01,000 varsh lage honge
 Hence, the height of the Himalayas must have been similar to that of Vindhyachal, about 8,01,000 years ago, which is mentioned in the present-day form in Valmiki Ramayana
 is tarah da0 vartak ko ek drushti se yah samay sambhav lagata he, parantu unka swayan maananaa he ki ve kisi anya strot se is samay kii pushti nahin kar sakate hai
 In his well-known treatise 'vaastav Ramayana', Dr
 Vartak has done the math on the basis of the planets, according to the planetary position mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana, to determine the actual birth date of Rama on 4 December 7323 BC
 unke anusaar isi tithi ko din main 1:30 se 3:00 baje ke bich ram kaa janm hua hoga
 After several years of research by Dr
 p
v
vartak, a research team of 'i-serve' proved Shri Ram's birth on 10 January 5114 BC using 'planetarium Gold' software
 unka maananaa tha ki is tithi ko grahon kii vahi sthiti thi jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana main he
 But this time has become very suspicious
 'ai-sarv' ke shodh dal ne jis 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog kiya vah vastav main isa purv 3000 se pehle kaa sahi grah-ganit karne main sakasham nahin he
 In fact, before 2013, there was no available software capable of doing so much earlier planetary mathematics
 is gananaa dwaara praapt grah-sthiti main shani vrishchik main tha arthath ucch main nahin tha
 The moon was not in Punarvasu Nakshatra but was in the second phase of Pushya and the date was also Ashtami
 baad main anya visheshgy dwaara ejplde431 software dwaara kii gayi sahi gananaa main tithi to navami ho jaati he parantu shani vrishchik main hi aata he tathaa chandramaa pushya ke chaturth charan main
 Therefore, the date of 10 January 5114 BCE is virtually not proved to be the birth date of Shri Ram
 aisi sthiti main ab yadi dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak dwaara pehle hi parishodhit tithi software dwaara pramanit ho jaae tabhi shriram kaa vaastavik samay praayah sarvamaanya ho paaegaa athwa pramanit na ho paane kii sthiti main naveen tithi ke shodh kaa rasta khulegaa
 There is clear evidence about the birth of Shri Ram in the Puranas that Shri Ram was born in a city called Ayodhya in Faizabad district of present-day Uttar Pradesh
 ayodhya jo ki bhagwaan ram ke purvajon kii hi rajdhani thi
 Raghu was the ancestor of Ramchandra ji
 ram bachapan se hi shant swabhaav ke vir purush the
 He always gave dignity the highest position
 isi kaaran unhen maryaada purushottam ram ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 His kingdom was considered fair and prosperous
 isliye bharat main jab bhi suraaj kii baat hoti he to ramraj yaa raamarajy kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 Rama, who followed the path of religion, received education from Guru Vasistha along with his three brothers
 kishoravastha main guru vishwamitra unhen van main rakshason dwaara machaae ja rahe utpaat ko samaapt karne ke liye saath le gayi
 Rama was accompanied by his younger brother Lakshmana in this task
 tadka naamak rakshasi baxur main rahati thi
 He was killed there
 ram ne us samay tadka naamak rakshasi ko maaraa tathaa marich ko palaayan ke liye majaboor kiya
 During this time, Guru Vishwamitra took him to Mithila
 vahaan ke videh raja janak ne apni putree sita ke vivaah ke liye ek swayamvar samaaroh yojit kiya tha
 Where Lord Shiva had a bow whose Sita was to be married to the knight who donated the emblem
 bahut saare raja maharaja us samaaroh main padhaare the
 When many kings tried to put a bow on the bow even after trying, they could not even lift it, then Rama tried to offer the bow by raising Vishwamitra's command
 unki pratyancha chadhaane ke praytn main vah mahaan dhanush ghor dhwani karte hue tut gaya
 When Maharishi Parashurama heard this loud sound, he came there and started expressing anger at his Guru's bow breaking
 lakshmana ugr swabhaav ke the
 He had a dispute with Parashurama
 tab ram ne bich-bachaav kiya
 Thus Sita was married to Rama and was blessed by all people including Parashurama
 ayodhya main ram sita sukhpurvak rahane lage
 People wanted Rama very much
 unki mridul, janasevayukta bhaavana or nyaaypriyata ke kaaran unki vishesh lokapriyata thi
 King Dasharatha was heading towards Vanaprastha
 at: unhone rajyabhaar ram ko saunpne kaa sochaa
 There was also a pleasant wave in public that their beloved king is about to appoint their beloved prince as king
 us samay ram ke anya do bhai bharat or shatrughna apane nanihaal kaikey gaye hue the
 Kaikeyi's maid Manthara misleads Kaikeyi that the king is doing wrong with you
 tum raja kii priy rani ho to tumhaari santan ko raja bananaa chahie par raja dasharath ram ko raja bananaa chaahate hai
 a detailed account of Rama's childhood is found in the Balakanda of Swami Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas
 raja dasharath ke teen raniyaan thim: kaushalya, sumitra or kaikeyi
 Ram was the son of Kaushalya, Sumitra had two sons, Lakshmana and Shatrughna and Kaikeyi's son Bharata
 rajya niyamo se raja kaa jyeshtha ladkaa hi raja banane kaa paatr hota he at: ram ko ayodhya kaa raja bananaa nishchit tha
 Kaikeyi who twice saved Dasharatha's life and Dasaratha gave her the boon that she could ask for two brides at any moment of her life
 ram ko raja banate hue or bhavishya ko dekhte hue kaikeyi chaahati thi uskaa putr bharat hi raja bane, isliye unhone raja dasharath dwaara ram ko 14 varsh kaa vanvaas dilaayaa or apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajya maang liya
 In the verses, the king Dasaratha was forced to accept this
 ram ne apane pita kii ajna kaa paalan kiya
 Ram's wife Sita and her brother Lakshmana also went to exile
 vanvaas ke samay, ravan ne sita kaa haran kiya tha
 Ravana was a demon and the king of Lanka
 ramayana ke anusaar, jab ram, sita or lakshmana kutiyaa main the tab ek hiran kii vaani sunakar sita vyakul ho gayi
 That deer was Ravana's maternal uncle Marich
 usne ravan ke kehane par sunahare hiran kaa rup banaaya
 Sita was fascinated to see him and requested Shriram to hunt the deer
 shriram apni bharya kii ichha puri karne chal pade or lakshmana se sita kii raksha karne ko kaha| marich shriram ko bahut dur le gaya
 On getting the opportunity, Shriram shot an arrow and killed the deer Marich
 marate-marate marich ne jor se "he sita! he lakshmana!" kii awaz lagaayi| us awaz ko sun sita chintit ho gayin or unhone lakshmana ko shriram ke paas jane ko kaha| lakshmana janaa nahin chaahate the, par apni bhabhi kii baat ko inkaar na kar sake
 Laxman drew a line before leaving, which is popularly known as Laxman Rekha
 ram, apane bhai lakshmana ke saath sita kii khoj main dar-dar bhatak rahe the
 Then they met two apes named Hanuman and Sugriva
 hanuman, ram ke sabase bade bhakt bane
 In order to reclaim Sita, Bhagavan Rama defeated Hanuman, Vibhishana and the monkey army with the help of Hanuman, Vibhishana and Vanara Sena, and on returning, guided Vibhishan to the good ruler by making him the king of Lanka
 bhagwaan ram ne jab ravan ko yuddh main parrast kiya or uske chote bhai vibhishana ko lanka kaa raja bana diya
 Ram, Sita, Lakshman and some monkeys departed from the Pushpak plane towards Ayodhya
 vahaan sabase milane ke baad ram or sita kaa ayodhya main rajbhishek hua
 The entire state started spending efficient time
 sita kii sati pramanikta siddh hone ke pashchaat sita apane donon putron kush or lav ko ram ke god main saunp kar dharti mata ke saath bhugarbha main chali gai
 Thereafter, the life of Ram's birth was also completed

 isliye saakshaatkaarkartta kaa yah dharm he ki vah kaam kii soochnaaon ko ekatra kare, soochna-sanketon kii taul kare, unhen sahi rup se samanvit kare or ant main aavedak ke chayan ke bare main nirnay par pahunche
 The interview is composed by conversation
 isliye isaki safalataa bhi donon pakshon kii vaartalapiya kaushal se nirdhaarit hogi
 Sometimes, in the event of an unexpected event, the contract established during the interview gets disturbed, then in such a situation a situation of finding a new balance comes again
 udyogon main saakshaatkaar kaa chikitsaatmak upyog bhi hone laga hai
 Structured interviews are used everywhere
 vartmaan main saakshaatkaar ke siddhanth or vyavhaar main apaar parivartan hue hai
 Symonds attributes four factors to the success of the interview - vidhi kii antim safalataa is baat par nirbhar karti he ki karmchaaree sangrakshan, dusron kii gopneeyata ke liye aadar tathaa praapt soochnaaon kaa sahi upyog kiya jaae to saakshaatkaar vidhi audyogic samasyaon ke adhyayan hetu amuly dharohar siddh ho sakati he
 This system is difficult to fully trust due to errors in interview methods
 nirikshan se spasht he ki ummidavaaron kaa moolyankan karne main vibhinn saakshaatkaarkarttaaon dwaara prachur bhinnataayen saamne aati hai
 Interview is the most subjective method
 chunki moolyankanon main satat anurupata nahin hoti, isliye is vidhi ko vishwasaneey nahin mana ja saktaa
 a method that is not reliable cannot even claim to be true
 scot, hallingworth tathaa vinagar aadi ne is par adhyayan kiya
 Not everyone has relied on the reliability of this method
 saakshaatkaar kii kuch pramukh trutiyaan is prakaar hai- Most interviewers are inadvertently influenced by previously established customized responses to pointless things
 jaise- ummidavaar kii dhwani, bolne kaa dhang aadi
 In a customized response, everyone expresses their liking, dislike, but is not aware of how specific behaviors seem interesting and uninteresting to them
 vyakti kii yah dharna rahati he ki ummidavaar saakshaatkaar ke samay apni jo aadat prakat karegaa, vahi har jagah prakat karegaa
 But psychologically it has no solid basis
 isliye samanyikrut aadat main vishwaas ke falswaroop kisi nirnay par pahunchnaa kathinhai
 The interviewer should try to remain free from these kinds of habits, otherwise its decisions may be faulty and may adversely affect the entire selection work
 saakshaatkaarkartta yathasambhav swayan ko purvaagrah se mukt rakhane kaa praytn karata he
 But in spite of all possible honesty, he has some unconscious attitude which consequently affects his orientation and behavior towards things, persons and events
 isliye saakshaatkaarkarta purnroopen in purvagrahon se mukt hone kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa
 At the time of the interview, the applicants appear to be mostly fearful and not completely free
 yah bhi sambhav ho saktaa he ki koi ummidavaar ghabaraakar apni yogyataon or vichaaron ko board ke samaksh sahi rup main nahin rakh paata he
 On the contrary, weak applicants impress the board due to repeated interviews
 ummidavaar kii yogyata or uplabdhi par hi saakshaatkaar kii safalataa nirbhar nahin karti he balki is prakaar kii paristhitiyon kaa saamana karne kii chaturaai or kaushal par nirbhar karti he
 The qualified person also fails in not being proficient in the art of interviewing
 is prakaar saakshaatkaar pranali par puraa bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In this, the person imitates the behaviors and manners of others
 saakshaatkaar ke samay yah pravriti baar-baar dekhne main aati he kyonki saakshaatkaarkartta kaa sthaan ucch hone ke kaaran ummidavaar anjaane main uskaa anukaran kar usase apana tadatmya sthapit karne kii cheshtaa karata he
 Such responses also arise in the applicant on expressing the friendliness of the interviewer
 inhen anukaranaatmak pravritiyon ko galat rup se lete hai
 As a result, its decisions are also inexact in the interview
 saakshaatkaar main trutiyon kaa sabase bada strot sambhawatah vyarth shabdaawaliyon kaa puraa-puraa arth spasht nahin kiya janaa he
 Normally, the interviewees are not given any list related to the merits of the candidates
 yadi yah suchi di bhi jaati he to shaayad hi inhen spasht paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Naturally, the path opens up more for individual judgments and interpretations, leading to intense differences among the interviewers on the question of candidate selection
 nirnay sambandhi ashuddhiyon kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 But the important thing is that despite the above difficulties, the popularity of the interview does not decrease
 paraspar aamane-saamne kii is prakriya main ummidavaar ke vyaktitv tathaa vyavhaar sambandhi anek bahumoolya rahasyon kaa bhi udghaatan ho saktaa he
 Interview is a medium through which candidates get an opportunity to express their feelings and thoughts verbally
 yah ek upyogi pranali he lekin isko upyogi chayan-pranali ghoshit karne main mukhyatya do prakaar kii kathinaaiyaan aati hai- Keeping these difficulties in mind, reform suggestions can be as follows: saakshaatkaarkarta kii kushalta hi saakshaatkaar kii safalataa par aadhaarit hoti he
 It is therefore necessary that the members of the interview committee should be carefully selected
 saakshaatkaarkartta ko yogya hona chahie
 He / she should have experience of articulation, variability, adjustability and taking various interviews
 use saakshaatkaar kala main vishisht prashikshan bhi milanaa chahie
 Without this, the interviewer cannot successfully complete the interview
 saakshaatkaar ke samay inhen koi ek hi pranali apnaane tathaa samaan aachaar samhita kaa paalan karne kaa prashikshan milanaa chahie
 Bingham and Moore have given the following advice for training prospective interviewers - shilgunon ke maapan hetu vastunishth paddati honi chahie
 This requires the use of authentic evaluation criteria
 maandand main jitne bhi upkhand dikhaae jaaen, nirnay kii satyata bhi utani hi adhik hoti he
 The list of modalities should be prepared either by experience, by employee managers and supervisors in advance or the list should be constructed by analysis method
 prashnon kaa nirmaan doshapurn nahin hona chahie, jisase ummidavaar ko uskaa arth samajhane main musiibat aati ho
 It is desirable to ask social questions in the interview which are related to the desired modalities
 saakshaatkaarkarttaaon ko vibhinn samoohon main vibhakt hona chahie
 a group must interview at least once before each candidate
 isse nirnay sambandhi ashuddhiyon ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, the reliability of the interview can also increase
 upyogi hote hue bhi yah suzav shaayad hi vyaavhaarik rup main prayukt hota he
 The difficulty is that the interview takes more time, which will increase further
 saakshaatkaar maatr vichaar vinimay hi nahin he
 The external behaviors of the interviewee should also be encouraged in the interview
 is sthiti main saakshaatkaar vyavhaar athwa paristhiti pareekshanon kii bhaanti kaary karata he
 Modern psychologists have expressed the idea that objective methods can be included in the interview method based on their experiences
 ank pradaan karne kii vidhi bhi isi ke sadrush apanaayi ja sakati he
 If the same type of questions are asked to each candidate for authenticating the positions used in the interview, then the purpose of the interview is not fulfilled
 saakshaatkaar paraspar moulik vaartalap kii paddati he jisamen baatcheet main nae vichaar tathaa chintan paidaa hote hai
 But it is difficult to fully predict the direction of the conversation
 saakshaatkaar ko pramanik banane hetu vivaran suchi kii ek manakikrut prati samiti ke sadasyon ko di jaye taaki usee ke anuroop vyavhaar kiya ja sake
 In this list, by marking the list of desired virtues, they mark only the qualities to be met by the candidate
 ise 'saakshaatkaar-karmchaaree moolyankan prapatr' kehete hai
 a scholar named Gion has given the following practical suggestions for the interview- yadi saakshaatkaar main sahi tareekon ko apanaaya jaye to ise vyavsaayik chayan kaa mahatvapurn saadhan banaaya ja saktaa he
 In the words of Blum and Neller, majhakot shivalay nepal ke pashchimanchal vikaas kshetra ke gandki anchal ke syanja jila main sthit ek atyaadhik urvar evam ghanaa basti vaali gram samiti he

 In the evening, after sundown, they open the fast and eat it which is called iftari
