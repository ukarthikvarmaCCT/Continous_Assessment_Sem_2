 In ancient times there were no universities in the recognized sense in the countries of Europe, although there were many important schools, such as the philosophical schools of Athens, or the schools of literature and customs of Rome, which were higher education institutions
 madhya yug main shiksha par dharmik sansthaaon kaa niyantran rahaa
 Religious institutions arranged schools in which clergy were taught religious, literary and scientific subjects
 is yug main paris kaa dharmik vidhyalay dharmashiksha kaa ek centre ban gaya, tathaa san 1198 tathaa 1215 i
 ke bich paris vishvavidhyalay ke rup main parivartit ho gaya or usamen dharmavigyaan, kala tathaa chikitsa ke prabhag banaae gaye
 Later, expert teachers and students jointly run the university
 12veen shatabdi ke madhya ke aasapaas bolona main kanoon ke vidhyaarthiyon ke prayaas se ek kanoon vishvavidhyalay sthapit kiya gaya
 Around 1250 AD, the word 'university' started being used in a new sense and instead of erudite students, the rulers started establishing political and social needs of their states
 madhyayugin vishvavidhyalay 13veen shatabdi ke madhya ke sarvotkrisht samay main bauddhik swatantraaa kii adwitiya avasthaa ko prakat karte hai
 Their progress was not interrupted due to money and they were able to resist the efforts that destroyed their independent rights
 ye apane yug kii samskruti ko nirdhaarit karne main prabhaavshaalee bane
 Medieval philosophy was born into colleges similar to some great religious movements that shook Europe of the Middle Ages and divided its unity
 isi 13veen shatabdi main mahadwipiya europe ke prabhaav se england main bhi oxford or cambridge vishvavidhyalay sthapit ho chuke the
 In Europe there was a definite change in the outlook and expansion of the university with the religion-reform-movement
 unki paramparaagat swavyavastha or swatantraaa lupt ho gai; praachaarya, rajya ke sevak ho gaye; kathor niyantran tathaa jaanch kii vyavastha kii gai
 The university came to be regarded as the institution for initiating workers for the state and related expenses
 ye vishvavidhyalay dharmik sansthaaon se sambandhit hote hue bhi 16veen shatabdi ke dharmik sangharshon se dur rahe
 Universities became centers of scientific discoveries in this century
 baad main 16veen shatabdi main shikshan hi inkaa mukhya kaary ho gaya
 In the 18th century, universities became adapted to the needs of society and tried to teach various subjects which were required for professional training
 france kii kranti ke baad vishvavidhyalayon dwaara rashtriya shiksha kii aayojana hone lagi
 In the 19th century, it was felt that universities should focus on higher education and research and remove secondary education from their minutes
 vaigyanik vishyon ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya gaya
 Universities of this period became not only science but also the center of politics and they did important work by creating permanent sense of nationality in national uplift of different countries
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak vishvavidhyalay kaa sambandh janata ke saath kaaphi ghanishtha ho gaya
 The 20th century saw wide changes in the approach of universities
 bauddhik vikaas kii paramparaagat simaaon kii upeksha karke unamem sabhi prakaar ke pravidhik vishay aarambh kiye gaye
 Sometimes, under the influence of utilitarianism, he became the head of a completely useful course

 Thus gradually the university moved away from the predominantly religious area and became related to the masses
 bharat main vaidic kaal ke gurukulon ko vishvavidhyalay kaa pracheen rup kaha ja saktaa he kyonki unheen main ucch shiksha kii vyavastha thi
 Later, in the Upanishads and Brahmin periods, we find "councils" functioning as universities

 In the Buddhist period, well-established centers of education were established in which Taxila and Nalanda were very famous

 started being taught
 san 1924 i

 The Central Government set up a University Grants Committee to examine the economic condition of universities and to give them appropriate grants for the promotion of higher education
 bhartiya vishvavidhyalay shikshan tathaa sambandhit karanevaale donon prakaar ke hai
 The University Grants Committee lays greater emphasis on the institution's teaching

 aaj ke vishvavidhyalayon evam vishvavidhyalaya shiksha kii anek samasyaayen hai jinpar shashan tathaa shikshavidon kaa dhyaan kendrit he
 Due to the spread of education at the secondary level, the number of students in universities is increasing and the question is whether universities should place all the students who want to study further, or choose only those who are able to benefit from higher education
 The What is the medium of education ?, is also an important question
 shodh kaary ko prashray dene kii samasya bhi dhyaan akarshith karti he
 In some universities, indiscipline of students is also a problem in schools
 yogya adhyapakon ko vishvavidhyalay main aakarshith karnaa tathaa unhen banaae rakhana kam mahatvapurn nahin
 Looking at the current state of the country and keeping in mind the needs of our today and tomorrow, what kind of courses should be started and what are the form of future universities? These questions are very important from the point of view of the nation

 Man has many rights as lawful

 In India, the legal measures can be broadly divided into two categories - sanvaidhik upachaar sanvidhi dwaara pradutt hote hai tathaa sanvaidhanik upayon kaa udgamasthal samvidhan he
 The third section of the Indian Constitution grants certain rights to every person governed by the Constitution
 rajya ko yah shakti praapt he ki samaaj ke kalyaan ke liye vah in adhikaron ke upbhog kaa viniman kare
 Many of these constitutional rights are also accepted by other written constitution countries
 par bharat kaa samvidhan is vishay main apratim he kyonki in adhikaron ke pravartan ke upaay bhi usamen spashtatya nirdisht hai
 Section 32 of our Constitution declares that a petition can be submitted before the Supreme Court for the enforcement of the rights conferred by the third clause of the Constitution
 is prakaar yah upachaar samvidhan dwaara pratyaabhoot he
 Only the sub-section of the said section empowers the Supreme Court to issue any order, direction or order for enforcement of rights, including the habeas corpus order, injunction, injunction, arbitrary order and inducement
 samvidhan kii dhara 226 dwaara rajya ke ucch nyaayalay ko yah adhikaar praapt he ki vah nirdesh, aadesh tathaa pradesh kaa nirgam keval samvidhanpradutt adhikaron ke pravartan ke liye hi nahin, apitu "kisi anya uddeshy ke liye" bhi kar saktaa he
 The purpose of these remedies is to provide speedy and economical measures for the enforcement of the legal rights of human beings so that these rights are free from the interference of legislature and executive
 bhartiya samvidhan kii dhara 32 tathaa 226 main ullikhit pradeshon tak hi sarvocch nyaayalay tathaa ucch nyaayalay ke upachaaratmak adhikaar simit nahin hai, apitu ve aavashyaktaanusaar koi aadesh, nirdesh tathaa pradesh bhi jari kar sakate hai
 Thus these remedial restrictions are sufficiently broad and unlimited
 aisa avasar upasthit hone par jabaki ukt pradesh rajya ke avaidh krity ke viruddh, vyakti ke adhikaron ke pun: sthaapan main aksham ho, tab nyaayalay kisi anya aadesh pradeshaadi kii avatarana karne ke liye bhi swatantra he
 In appropriate cases, the court is also free to make declarations, if it thinks fit
 sarvocch nyaayalay bhartiya seemaa ke antargat kisi bhi adhikari ke naam aadesh, nirdesh athwa pradesh jari kar saktaa he
 The powers of the High Court are limited to its territorial limits
 ucch nyaayalay dwaara nirgamit aadesh athwa pradesh, sampidhanpradutt moulik adhikaron ke pravartan ke liye athwa "anya kisi uddeshy ke liye" jari kiye jate hai
 Explaining this passage "for any other purpose", the Supreme Court has concluded that this power can be used only for the enforcement of "other legal rights" by the High Court
 at: spasht he ki sanvaidhanik tathaa anya vidhik adhikaron ke pravartan ke atirikt anya kisi adhikaar ke pravartan ke liye ucch nyaayalay sambhavat: apni shakti kaa prayog nahin karegaa
 As a result, the court cannot exercise this power for the enforcement of moral rights

 Some people are protecting the computer program by describing the copyright in such a way that neither they themselves hold any ownership over it nor can any other person hold the proprietary rights over the computer program they have created
 udaahranarth, yadi main koi computer program likhuun or uskaa sorce code or object code main is tarah kii ghoshnaa tathaa shart lagaate huye prakashit karun ki But its condition is that, ab is ghoshnaa or shart ke kaaran na to main swayan na or koi anya vyakti is computer program ke prayog karne athwa sanshodhan karne haq rakh saktaa he
 Through such a declaration, i have made sure that any other person can also use or amend it without infringing the copyright
 saadharantay:, copirite kaa arth yah hota he ki koi anya vyakti uskaa prayog athwa sanshodhan uske maalik kii anumati ke na kar sake
 Here the reverse work was done using copyright
 copirite kaa yadi koi ulta shabd ho saktaa he to vah he copileft
 It is a new word and has not yet appeared in the English dictionary, although it is a popular word in the computer dictionary
 jis computer program ke license main is tarah kii ghoshnaa or shart hoti he use copilefted software kaha jaataa he
 This type of software is also called free software
 free shabd kaa prayog karnaa richard stallmen ne shuru kiya or yah aandolan bhi unka hi shuru kiya gaya he
 He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1980s

 Stalman felt that in this way the computer software would be left with a few special people and there would be no complete development
 isaliye unhone apana institute ko chhod kar ghanu project, free sours foundation ke antargat shuru kiya
 In this, we started writing software that are copylefted
 unhone is tarah ke saftware ko free-sauftware kaa naam diya
 This is because, according to them, people have the freedom to modify computer programs or software, they say that do not think of free as in free beer but look like it is in freedom of speech
 free sours foundation kii websit ke mutabik, unhi ke shabdon main 'free software' is a matter of liberty, not price
 To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech', not as in 'free beer' The following are the main things in free or copied software - Source code is always published in this, there is no money or royalty to be paid for such software, but if you are giving any service in relation to it, then take the money to provide the service
 Can
 is tarah ke sauftware ko koi bhi sanshodhit kar saktaa he is tarah ke sauftware ko sanshodhan karne ke baad prakashit karne yaa bottne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 You can use it in your organization without publishing or sharing
 par yadi is tarah ke sauftware ko bina sanshodhan kiye yaa sanshodhit karne ke baad baanta jaataa he to usamen vahi sharten rahengin jo ki pehle thim yani ki sorcecode prakashit karnaa padega; anya logon ko sanshodhan karne kii swatantraaa deni hogi; tathaa sauftware ke liye koi paisa yaa royalti nahin lee ja sakati he
 Stalman, with the help of some lawyers, wrote the General Public License, which contained such a declaration and condition that copyleft any software
 isaliye is tarah ke sauftver ko jeepield sauftver bhi kaha jataa he
 That is, free softwares or copylefted softwares or gepyld softwares are synonyms of the same kind of softwares

 Types of: - vastunishthawad, positivism kaa hindikaran he
 Positivism, derived from the French word "positif", is used in the sense of "fixed", unambiguous "and" asserted
 yah anubhavathit tatv vaigyanik atakalon tathaa purv dharanaon kaa parityag kar anubhavpradatton tak simit rah sabhi anubhavvaadi darshanon par lagu hota he
 Kant had chosen this term for that system of thought and life which considers knowledge based only on discoveries and methods of real physical phenomena, but "objectivism", used in different contexts, is useful, relative, rules, in addition to reality, fixed and pure

 According to Kant, in addition to scientific methods, it is also necessary to adopt a scientific approach so that moral and social trade of life can be arranged and sorted just like physical events

 The various stages represent the infancy, adolescent and adult stages of mankind
 manushya maatr kaa saanskrithik vikaas maanavikaran kii praarambhik pravriti se prarambh hokar darshanik niyamon kii pratishtha ke madhya hokar vastunishthavadi str par pahunchataa he
 As a reaction to traditional philosophies, substantial promotion of Objectivism took place, especially in South America
 sanyukt rajya main vyavahaarwad, navy vastuwaad, aalochanatmak vastuwaad tathaa jadwaad ke prachlan se vastunishthawad kaa keval ek vishesh rup "taarkik anubhavvaad" punap sakaa jo kont kaa drushtikon apanaae hue he
 Logical Objectivism is a bizarre combination of Hume's empiricism, Kant's objectivism, and Whitehead Russell's logical analysis

 By considering the process of verification as the meaning of a preamble, the logical objectivists consider the traditional philosophical questions as meaningless because they do not have any meaning according to this new interpretation as being related to the latent subjects
 udgaman ko "kaary karne kaa niyam" tathaa vaigyanik niyamon ko "ekvachaneey prastaavnaon kii yojanaayen" maanakar taarkik anubhavvaadi vigyaan kaa vah sangat chitra prastut karata he jiske anusaar tatvavaigyanik pariklpanaayen purnataya bahishkrut hai
 But there will be a complete lack of objectivity in science based on the experience of the person
 is vastunishthawad main is prakaar nishchit nirpeksh tathaa vastugat kuch bhi nahin rah jaataa
 This constructive synthesis of opposing tendencies like empiricism and rational rationalism refuses its own theory in the sense of meaning

 Hilal said that his experiences while traveling outside Saudi Arabia wearing necabs are part of the process that led to the "chaos of fatwas"; The negative reactions from western countries led him to think how the extremists of his religion gave all Muslims a bad name

 The Devanagari script has its roots in the ancient Brahmi family
 gujarat ke kuch shilalekhon kii lipi, jo pratham shatabdi se chauthi shatabdi ke bich ke hai, nagari lipi se bahut mail khaati he
 The use of Nagari can be seen continuously throughout the 7th century and beyond
 'nagari' shabd kii utpatti ke vishay main matbhed he
 Some people get rid of it only by meaning 'city key' or 'dealing in cities'
 bahut logon kaa yah mat he ki gujarat ke nagar brahmanon ke kaaran yah naam padaa
 The Nagar Brahmins of Gujarat give evidence of the Skanda Purana's civil division in relation to their origin
 nagar khand main chamatkarpur ke raja kaa vedavetta brahmanon ko bulaakar apane nagar main basaanaa likhaa he
 It also mentions that due to a special incident, Miraclepur got the name 'nagar' and the Brahmins settled there named 'nagar'
 gujarat ke nagar brahman aadhunik badnagar ko hi 'nagar' or apana sthaan batalaate hai
 Therefore, assuming the connection of the Nagari letters to the Nagara Brahmins, one has to believe that these characters went from where the Brahmin went to Gujarat
 gujarat main duusari ore saatvin shatabdi ke bich ke bahut se shilaalekh, tamrapatr aadi mili hai jo brahmi or dakshini style kii pashchimi lipi main hai, nagari main nahin
 The oldest authentic article in Gujarat, which also contains Nagari alphabets, is the copperplate of Kalchuri Samvat 456 of Gurjaravanshi king Jayabhata
 yah tamrashasan adhikansh gujarat kii tatkaaleen lipi main he, keval raja ke hastakshar utriy bharat kii lipi main hai jo nagari se milti julati he
 There is one other thing
 gujarat main jitne daanpatr uttareey bharat kii arthath nagari lipi main mili hai ve bahudhaa kanyakubj, patli, pundravardhan aadi se liye hue brahmanon ko hi pradutt hai
 Under the influence of Rashtrakuta kings, the script of Northern India became particularly popular in Gujarat and was called Nagari there due to the interference by the Nagar Brahmins
 yah lipi madhya aryaavart kii thi sabase sugam, sundar or niyambaddh hone kaaran bharat kii pradhan lipi ban gai
 The 'nagari script' is not mentioned in ancient texts
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki pracheen kaal main vah 'brahmi' hi kehalaati thi, uskaa koi alag naam nahin tha
 If 'nagar' or 'nagar' is considered to be a relation of 'nagari' with Brahmins, then more and more it will have to be said that this name went to Gujarat and remained famous for a few days
 baudhon ke pracheen granth 'lalitvistar' main jo un 64 lipiyon ke naam ginaae gaye hai jo buddha ko sikhaai gai, unamem 'nagari lipi' naam nahin he, 'brahmi lipi' naam hai
 'lalitwistar' was translated into Chinese in AD 308

 In the commentary of 'nityasodashikarnava', Bhaskarananda mentions the 'nagara script' and writes that the form of 'A' in the Nagara script 'is a triangle
 yah baat prakat hi he ki ashokalipi main 'e' kaa aakaar ek trikon he jisamen pherfr hote hote aajkal kii nagari kaa 'e' bana he
 a Pandit named Seshakrishna, who was around seven and a half hundred years old, also mentions the 'nagar' language, counting the apabhramsa languages
 sabase pracheen lipi bharatvarsh main ashok kii pai jaati he jo sindh nadi ke paar ke pradeshon ko chhod bharatvarsh main sarvatra bahudhaa ek hi rup kii milti he
 Two short articles have been found before the time of Ashoka
 inamen se ek to nepal kii tarai main 'piprava' naamak sthaan main shakya jativaalon ke banawaye hue ek buddha stupa ke bheetar rakhe hue pathar ke ek chote se paatr par ek hi pankti main khuda hua he or buddha ke thode hi peeche kaa he
 There is no special difference between the letters of this article and the letters of Ashoka
 atanr itnaa hi he ki inamen daargh swarchihnon kaa abhaav he
 The second is from Mahavir Samvat 84 in a village called Badli, some distance away from Ajmer
 yah stambh par khude hue kisi bade lekh kaa khand he
 The volume of long 'E' in 'veerab' in it is completely different and older than the long 'E' in Ashoka's articles
 jis lipi main ashok ke lekh hai vah pracheen aaryo yaa brahmanon kii nikaali hui brahmi lipi he
 It is written in the 'prajnapanasutra' of the Jains that 'ardhamagadhi' language
 jis lipi main prakashit kii jaati he vah brahmi lipi he'
 Ardhamagadhi language is the language of the region between Mathura and Pataliputra from which Hindi originated
 atah brahmi lipi madhya aryaavart kii lipi he jisase kramshah us lipi kaa vikaas hua jo peeche nagari kahalaai
 The present form of Nagari is clearly visible in the crooked Magadhi letters of the time of King Adityasena of Magadha
 isa kii naveen or dasvin shatabdi se to nagari apane purna rup main lagati he
 How the Nagari alphabets are being gradually transformed from the letters of the time of Ashoka, has been clearly shown by Pandit Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha in the book 'ancient Lipimala' and by a map
 mi0 shamshastri ne bhartiya lipi kii utpatti ke sambandh main ek nayaa siddhant prakat kiya he
 He said that in ancient times, before the statue was built, the gods were worshiped by some symbolic symbols, which were written in the middle of many types of triangles etc
 ye trikon aadi yantra 'devnagar' kehalaate the
 In the midst of those 'devnagar', many types of symbolic symbols written in the middle of time became known as letters
 isi se in aksharon kaa naam 'devanagari' padaa'
 After about AD 350, two branches of Brahmi have been considered according to the style of writing
 vindhyas se uttar kii style uttari tathaa dakshin kii dakshini style
 "nagari" was practiced in the south in 675 on the basis of a copper plate of the Rashtrakuta king "dantadurga"
 vahaan ise "nandinagari" kehete the
 Based on the writings of the dynasties, it survives in the south until after the 16th century
 devanagari se hi "kathi", "mahajanee", "rajasthani" or "gujarati" aadi lipiyon kaa vikaas hua
 "bangla" emerged from the eastern branch of ancient Nagari around the tenth century
