 apane pita hiranyaksh ke bhagwaan vishnu ke varah avatar dwaara vadh pashchaat aahaat andhakasur bhagwaan shankar or vishnu ko apana param shatru maanane laga
 Andhakasura meditated on Brahmadev and got the boon of not being killed by the gods
 andhakasur ne triloki kaa upbhog karte hue indralok ko jeet liya or vah indra ko peedit karne laga
 According to Padmapuran, Andhakasura was the only monster who had taken amritpana except rahu-ketu
 apni shakti or vikaraal swarup ke kaaran yah daitya itnaa andhaa ho chukaa tha ki ise apane samaksh koi dikhaai hi nahi detaa tha
 Due to the blindness of this important, Andhakasur also became fascinated with Goddess Parvati and also tried to get Parvati and in this effort, Andhakasura tried to kill Lord Shankar by taking the form of Parvati and tricking Lord Shankar
 Had hit his head with his mace
 shiv kaa rup dhaaran karke andhakasur ne mata parvati kaa haran bhi kar liya
 Even after not wanting, Lord Shankar had to fight to save Parvati from her own part Andhakasura and protect the religion

 In the fierce battle, a huge form of sweat was born from the sweat that fell from Lord Shankar's forehead, who started eating the blood and organs of Andhakasura that fell on the earth, and by eating the blood and organs of Andhakasur, he himself became like Andhakasur but even after slaughter The hunger of the formidable form of Andhakasura did not calm down, then he got involved in extreme austerity in front of Lord Shankar

 Then that monstrous creature received the boon from Shivshankar to take the three worlds
 vardaan swaroop andhakasur kaa vikaraal vishaal sharir ab ek vastu kaa aakaar le chukaa tha
 And a horrible object fell on the earth, blocking the sky
 tab bhaybheet hue devtaa or brahma shiv daityon or rakshason dwaara vah stambhit kar di gai
 All the gods seated him there and fell on him
 is prakaar sabhi devataaon dwaara us par nivas karne ke kaaran vah vastu rup vikaraal purush vaastupurush naam se vikhyath hua
 Then that deformed object form Vikral Purush requested the gods and received a boon
 brahma aadi devataaon ne use vaastu purush kii sangya dekar vardaan diya
 According to the boon, the sacrifice made at the end of the yagya in the yajna will be the food of the original man
 tathaa vaastu shanti va yagyotsav me bhi di gai aahuti par vaastupurush kaa adhikaar hoga tathaa vaastupurush har vastu me vidhman rahegaa

 The most effective propaganda is one whose content is often completely true, but it may also contain a small amount of false, half-truth or logical fallacy
 adhiprachaar ke bahut se tareeke hai
 The purpose of propaganda is to influence people's behavior and opinions rather than giving information
 propaganda kaa hindi main shabdic arth he prachaar, adhiprachaar athwa mat-prachaar
 Propaganda is done to propagate an idea and point of view, for a particular purpose, especially under a political purpose
 lekin isaki buniyaad aam taur par satya par nahin tiki hoti
 Propaganda began as a henchman to morally defeat the enemy's army during the war
 iske baad zikr miltaa he ki 1622 main pandrahawein pope gregory ne vatican main protestant sudhaaron ke kilaaf propaganda kaa kaam sanbhaala tha
 Propaganda's image became negative when the British government systematically propagated its letter of political interests during World War I
 kalantar main iskaa upyog chunaav-prachaar ke liye bhi hone laga
 Initially, it was used during political campaigns to garner support for the candidate's interest
 tatpashchaat isaki upyogita samajhate hue iskaa vistaar hua or ise vigyaapan kaa bhi ang bana liya gaya
 Propaganda also had a positive side when it came to advertising
 vah bhaawanaaon ko sparsh karne vaale ek sukhad ehsaas ke vaahak kii bhoomika nibhaane laga or ek khaas sandarbh main rachanaatmak ho gaya
 The basis of information provided by Propaganda has always been negative rather than historically positive
 iske madhyam se di jane vaali jaankaree praayah ek tarfaa or bhraamak prakruti kii hoti he
 Propaganda was used to promote a particular viewpoint for political reasons
 aaj propaganda kaa falak kaafii vyapak ho gaya he or iskaa upyog jaan-boojh kar kisi vyakti, sanstha, raashtra, utpaada athwa kisi raajnneetik party ke bare main nakaaratmak soochna failaane ke liye kiya jane laga he
 The other side of propaganda is that it is also seen as a special type of message
 ek aise sandesh ke rup main jise kisi vishesh samskruti, darshan, vichaar athwa mat ko kisi naare aadi ke madhyam se bazaar or samaaj main prachlit karne ke liye kiya prachaarit jaataa he
 Propaganda has been used to prove lies to be true during war
 america is propaganda kaa sabase bada prayokta mana jaataa he
 He always spreads the news during the war that he is fighting to protect humanity and fight terrorism, when his motive is something else
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan pichley do dashakon main hue iraq or afghanistan ke yudhon main dekhne ko mila
 The US has always maintained that it was necessary to fight terrorism, while the fact was that it was carrying an army of journalists who were on its side or who had been bought, along with its soldiers
 ye patrkaar apni khabaron ko live dikhaane ke naam par aisi jaankaree kaa prasaaran karte rahe jo sach nahin thi
 Such journalism itself is called jaded journalism or embedded journalism
 is tarah kii patrakarita main ek paksh kii ichha ke anusaar reporting kii jaati he or sach ko gaayab kar diya jaataa he
 Many times this journalism is also used by political parties to create public opinion in their favor
 kuch sanchaarshastriyon kii manyata he ki propaganda kaa udbhav jan-sanchaar madhyamon ke vikaas ke baad hua
 They consider it as part of communication that communication to attract public opinion is a form of propaganda
 yahan sanchaar or propegande ke sambandh par gaur karnaa zaruri he
 The invention of radio in the early twentieth century gave Propaganda a special boom
 radio ke madhyam se kaafii kam samay main ek vyapak jan-samooh tak apni baat ko pahunchaaya ja saktaa he
 The development of radio not only worked to spread self-motivated and sponsored information, but it also originated the advertisement whose developed forms are in front of us in various forms today
 radio ke vikaas ke pehle itane kam samay main ek vyapak jan-samooh tak sidhe-taur par apni baat pahunchaa paanaa asambhav sa tha
 It is of course that information could also be communicated directly through the print medium, but the readers of newspapers were few
 pathak banane ke saath sakshartaa kii shart bhi judi hui thi
 Radio unveiled a new world of advertising where reading ability was not necessary
 isse vigyaapan kii pahunch or prabhaav kaa dayera aseemit ho gaya
 Along with advertising, political propaganda also expanded very rapidly
 radio ke baad propaganda ko tivi ke aagaman ne ek or nayaa oochaal diya
 TV was not able to overthrow radio, but its credibility was more authentic than radio
 badi-badi companiyon ne jab apane utpaadon ko badha-chadha kar pesh kiya to logon ne us prachaar main apni chhavi dekhni shuru kar di
 That is why advertising guru Alec Padmasi once said that when people of India become customers of something, they become less than logic and more than emotion
 unhone liril sabun ke vigyaapan kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki ‘aapako kya lagata he yah jo ladki bikni pahanakar jharne main nahaati he or neembu kii khushboo ke ehsaas jaisi tarotaza mahasoos karti he, to vah kya sachmuch vaastavik bharat ke gaanvon or shaharon main sambhav he? jahaan ek baaltee pani dhang se nahaane ke liye naseeb hota, vahaan vah neembu kii khushboo vaale ehsaas kaa anubhav kaise ho saktaa he?’ isi aadhaar par padmasi kehete hai ki vigyaapan propaganda ke madhyam se upabhokta ke saamne ek aisi chhavi nirmit kar detaa he jisamen upabhokta apni chhavi dekhne lagate hai
 In recent years, the invention of the Internet and e-mail gave Propaganda a global expansion
 masalan web-madhyamon main vah takat he jo sthaneey mudde ko vaishvik mudda bana sakati he
 Web-mediums have violated all the boundaries of geography and transformed the entire world into a small village
 kshan bhar main local se global ho jane ke liye logon ne internet pranali kaa jam kar laabh uthaaya he
 The most powerful example of how a local singer and local music has become the most popular music via the Internet in a short time is the song called Kolaberry Dee
 marketing kii bhashaa main jise ham viral marketing ke naam se jaanate hai darasal vah media kii bhashaa main propaganda hi he
 On the one hand propaganda is seen as a medium to present negative things in a positive way and on the other hand propaganda is a skill of propaganda in which a subject is presented in such a way that people are attracted towards it
 Go sambandhit vishay ko ek aisi bhashaa, lay or sangeet ke madhyam se prastut kiya jaae ki aam upabhokta apnaapan mahasoos karke us utpaada ke saath jud jaataa he
 For this, various media mediums are used
 jaise : television, radio, binar, internet, billboard, ligalet ityadi
 The negative side in this role of giving touch to emotions is only that such propaganda destroys the rationality of man and makes the emotional side more effective in his place
 america ke ek vigyaapan-lekhak tristrian toliver ne propaganda ke bare main kaha he : main hameshaa apane bare main yahi sochataa hoon ki aapako log isliye nahin pasand karte ki aapane kya kiya or unke liye kya kiya
 Rather you are always remembered for what you made them feel through your words
 masalan propaganda main yah baat bahut myne nahin rakhti kii kisi baat ko aapane kitne achche tareeke se rakhaa balki sabase mahatvapurn cheez hoti he usase nikalne vaali vah anubhuti or prerana jo logon par apni chhap chhod jaae
 The pleasant feeling of propaganda has the ability to be remembered for a long time
 is lihaaz se vigyaapan main propaganda kaa istemaal use sirf nakaaratmak na ban kar sakaaratmak rup bhi dene laga he
 According to this aspect Propaganda is the name of an entire process based on the concept of creative nature
 iskaa upyog kis prakaar se kiya janaa he— yah puri tarah upbhogakarta par nirbhar karata he
 Anti-capitalist color french postcard : pratham vishwayuddh ke samay main germany ke wilhem dwitiya ko dharti ko munh se katate hue dikhaaya gaya he
 America's propaganda poster against Hitler in World War II 'soye hue hathi uth ja' : japani poster jisamen aaazaad hind fouj ko hathi ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he, jisane soond se jon bul ko hawa main uthaa liya he

 When the Bundi royal family had a relationship in Rewa, they gave some jagirs to the Raja Pandits and brought them to Bundi
 bundi ke raja budhsingh, jo savai jaisingh ke bahanoi the, ke shashan main shrikrishna bhatta kaviklanidhi bundi rajya ke rajpandit the
 "he was not only a learned scholar of scriptures like Vedas, Puranas, philosophy, grammar, music, etc
 He was also an outstanding orator and poet of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Brajbhasha - Sawai Jaisingh was so impressed with him that he came to Amer at any cost

 Devarshi Shri Krishna Bhatt ji was conferred the titles of 'kavikalanidhi' and 'ramarasacharya'
 maharaja jaisingh ne veda-shastron par unke adbhut vaidushya tathaa sanskrit, praakrit tathaa brajabhasha main rasaatmak kavita karne kii anupam kshamta se prabhavit hokar unhen ‘kaviklanidhi’ ke alankaran se sammanit kiya tha
 Sawai Jai Singh himself had also honored him with the title of 'ramarasacharya', in whose context an interesting incident is described
 ek darbar ke dauraan maharaja jaisingh ne sabhaasadon se poocha ki jis tarah shrikrishna kii raasalila kaa varnan miltaa he, kya us tarah shriram kii raasalila ke prasang kaa bhi kahin koi ullekh he? puure darbar main chuppi chaa gai
 Then Shri Krishna Bhatt ji stood up and said that one such book is available in Kashi
 raja ne unhen is pustak ko do maheenon ke bheetar le aane ke liye kaha
 Shri Krishna Bhatt ji knew that there was no such book in reality, when he had said that such a book should be in Kashi
 unhone tab swayan ram-raas par kavy likhnaa prarambh kiya or do maheene ke bheetar hi brajabhasha main “ramrasa” naamak pustak taiyaar kar di jo ramayana ke hi samakaksh thi
 Having received the book within the time limit and knowing that this poem was written by Kavikalanidhi Sri Krishna Bhatt himself, the poet-art-penetrating Maharaja was very pleased and honored Bhattji with the title of "ramarasacharya" and huge amount of money

 bhashavigyaan ke antargat arthvigyaan yaa 'shabdaarthvigyaan' shabdon ke arth se sambandhit vidha he
 The study of the meaning of words and sentences in the realm of language is called semantics
 unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh se pehle arth-vigyaan ko ek alag anushaasan ke rup main manyata nahin thi
 The French philosopher Michel Brill founded this discipline and named it 'cementics'
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main fardinaind da sasyur dwaara pravartit bhashaai kranti ke baad se cementics ke pair samaaj-vigyaan main jamate chale gayi
 The first task of cementics is to identify linguistic categories and interpret them in appropriate terminology
 upar se sahaj par bheetar se pechida lagane vaali arth- sambandhi kavayaden cementics kii madad ke bina nahin ho saktin
 For example, the usefulness of cementics can be ascertained by looking at the difference in meaning between 'mortal is people' and 'mortal was Gandhi'
 duusare vaakya kaa nihitarth yah he ki gandhi ko amar mana jaataa tha yaa gandhi jaise log bhi nashwar hote hai
 Cementics explores how language works to make this difference of meaning
 vicitra baat yah he ki arth-vigyaan par shuruyaat main bhashaa-shastriyon bajaay ne gahari daali
 From the sixties linguists began to outline two basic types of linguistic meanings
 mana gaya ki arth kii pehali kism to bhashaai rup main hi sahjaat hoti he
 The second type is related to the interaction between the form spoken and the context of that expression
 ke arth-nirupan teen ke vibhedon ke tahat kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The first of these is the difference between perception and context
 doosraa he shabd ke arth or vaakya ke arth kaa bhed
 The third is the difference between text and context
 is tisare antar ko ab cementics se alag karke bhashaa-shastriyon ne pregamatics ke rup main nayaa anushaasan bana diya gaya he
 Under Cementics, the language that is studied is called the target language and the language in which it is interpreted is called the metalingual
 ek lakshya-bhashaa apni vyakhya ke metaalenguage bhoomika adaa sakati he
 In the history of linguistics, the metaphorical exercises were first word-centered, then they were sentence-centered and then they became text-centered
 in teenon prakriyaaon ne media-adhyayan, saahityalochana, vyaakhyaatmak samajashaastra or sangyanatmak vigyaan ke anushasano ko prabhavit kiya he
 Cementics raises the question whether the meaning of a word should be identified within the scope of the language or help is also taken from outside its scope for interpretation
 masalan, kursi kaa matlab hamen pataa he, par, yah arth ham kis prakaar hasil karte hai? ham kah sakate han ki kursi par baitha jaataa he
 However, within the language the meaning of the chair is also assumed with its relation to other meanings such as furniture, table, seat or bench
 in shabdon ke saath rakh kar baithne ke liye kaam aane vaali kursi kaa arth-grahan alag ho jaataa he
 Another example of the difference between perception and reference is the planet Venus or Venus
 ise bhor kaa tara bhi kaha jaataa he or sandhya-tara bhi, kyonki isaki chamak subah bhi dikhaayi padati he or raat main bhi
 In this way Venus, the morning star and evening star are three names of the same thing
 lekin sandarbh ek hi hote hue bhi teenon ko alag-alag bodh ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The emphasis of cementics is less on context and more on perception, because it wants to eclipse, so that the understanding of reality can also be achieved through language and for that, culture, history and other physical processes Is not important
 bhashaa ke bheetar shabdaarth praapt karne ke liye cementics main teen mukhya sambandhon samanarthak, vilomarthak or hyponomical kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Hyponimical categories are those that include word expressions
 jaise, kutta kisi billi, bandar, jiraph yaa khargosh kii tarah ek pashu bhi he or saath main vah terrior, hound, german sheoard yaa ritreaver bhi ho saktaa he
 It is worth noting that these three forms are used to create meaning within a well-defined linguistic system, but this does not mean that social and community processes of meaning-making and meaning-making are also pertinent
 masalan, koi aisa samudaay bhi ho saktaa he jo in teen sambandhon ke bina arthath bhashaa ke daayre ke baahar shabdon kii arth-rachana karata ho
 In North American, Hopi is such that the same word is used instead of different for all things except birds
 is kabeeley ke log machhar, gubbaaraa or hawaii jahaaz yaa aisi hi kisi chiz ko ‘masaytaka’ naam dete hai
 Taking sentences through sentences also comes under the scope of cementics
 ‘ramesh ne umesh se makaan karidaa’ darasal ‘umesh ne ramesh ko makaan bechaa’ kaa samanarthak he
 a similar synonym is between 'the police have arrested the agitators' and 'the agitators have been arrested by the police'
 isi tarah vaakyon ke bich duusare arth-sambandh banate hai
 For example, the connection between 'osama bin Laden killed at the hands of American commando unit' and 'osama bin Laden killed' can be seen
 agar pehle vaakya ke mutabik america commando unit ne osama ko vastav main maar daalaa he, to doosraa vaakya bhi jis yatharth kaa nirupan karnaa chahta he use sach maan liya jayega
 In addition to the dependence of one sentence on the other in terms of meaning, the sentences also depend on the pre-recognition inherent in it for its meaning
 jaise : ‘raksha mantralay ke ek vaktavy ke anusaar bharat ko un shaktiyon kaa prayog karnaa chahie jinase pakistan ko seemaa-paar se hone vaale antakawaad ko protsaahit karne se roka ja sake’
 There are two pre-beliefs in this sentence: first, India has the necessary powers and second, Pakistan is promoting cross-border terrorism
 pichley das saal main cementics or pregamatics ke kshetron main jabardast bhashaa-shastreey kaam hua he
 These semantic exercises that distinguish between the meanings of sentences and words may seem trivial from the top, but their importance cannot be denied to reveal the underlying ideological implications and contrivances in a text
 cementics or pregamatics kaa sahaara lekar raajnneeti-vigyaan ke kai padon main hue arth sambandhi parivartanon kaa adhyayan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, democracy has been interpreted as a system of disorganized and chaotic system of ordinary people or their crowd for a long time since the time of Aristotle
 lekin aaj loktantr ek vyavasthit kriyavidhi ke mutabik kaam karne vaali vyavastha ke arth main rudh ho gaya he
 Therefore, as soon as someone demands direct intervention in the processes of demand or movement, it starts to be declared a threat to the system
 bharat main jaiprakash narayan ke netritv main chale sampoorn kranti andolan ne pratinidhi vaapasi ke adhikaar kii maang karke aisi hi arth-sambandhi bechainiyaan paidaa kii thim
 The anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare has also introduced economic problems related to democracy
 ab yah bhashaa-shastriyon or loktantr ke chintakon kaa kaam he ki ve loktantr ke arth main aaye is parivartan kii arth-vaigyanik vyakhya karen

 vigyaan ke antargat electronics yaa electronic vigyaan or praudyogiki kaa vah kshetra he jo vibhinn prakaar ke madhyamon se hokar aavesh ke pravaah evam un par aadhaarit yuktion kaa adhyayan karata he
 As a technology, electronics is the field which deals with the construction of suitable electrical circuits using various electronic devices, etc
) and through them to convert the electrical signals in the desired manner
 isamen tarah-tarah kii yuktiyon kaa adhyayan, unamem sudhaar tathaa nayi yuktiyon kaa nirmaan aadi bhi shaamil he
 Historically, the field of electronics and electrical technology has been the same and both were not considered separate from each other
 kintu ab nayi-nayi yuktiyon, paripathon evam unke dwaara sampadit kaaryon main atyadhik vistaar ho jane se electranix ko vaidyut praudyogiki se alag shakha ke rup main padhaaya jane laga he
 In this view, the fields related to high electric power are considered under electrical technology, while the field related to the changes in low electric power and electric signals are called electronics
 paripathon ke aadhaar par electanic praudyogiki ko mukhyatah do bhaagon main baantkar adhyayan kiya jaataa he: The electrical signals in these circuits are continuous and they remain constant even after processing them
 udhaaharan ke liye trangistor-pravardhak ek analog system he
 The development of operational amplifier and its availability as an I-C led to a revolution in analog electronics
 isamen vidyut sanket ankiy hote hai
 Digital signals can be of many types, but binary digital signals are most commonly used

 Digital electronic has become very important ever since integrated circuits have emerged and millions of electronic devices are being loaded into a small chip

 kranti adhikaron yaa sanghathanaatmak sanrachana main hone vaala ek moolbhoot parivartan he jo apekshaakrit kam samay main hi ghatit hota he
 Aristotle described two types of political revolutions: maanav itihaas main anekon krantiyaan ghatit hoti ai hai or vah paddati, avadhi va prerak vaicharik siddhant ke maamle main kaaphi bhinn hai
 Due to their results, there were major changes in culture, economy and socio-political institutions
 ek kranti main koun se ghatak shaamil hote hai or koun se nahin, is sambandh main vidvattapurna charchaa kai muddon ke ird gird kendrit he
 Early studies of revolutions have primarily analyzed European history from a psychological point of view, but more modern trials also include global phenomena and include the perspectives of many social sciences, including sociology and political science
 kranti par vidvattapurna vichaaron kii kai pidiyon ne anekon pratispardhaatmak siddhanton ko janm diya he or is jatil tathy ke prati vartmaan samaj ko viksit karne main kaaphi yogadan diya he
 Copernicus called his article "on the Revolution of Celestial Bowdies" his article on the motion of planets around the Sun
 iske baad 'kranti' khagol vidya se jyotish sambandhi swadeshi vidya ke kshetra main pravisht ho gayi; jisane saamaajik vyavastha main aakasmik parivartanon kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 The first political use of the term was in 1688 by William III to describe James ii's replacement
 is prakriya ko "da glorious rivolushan " kaa naam diya gaya
 Most often, the term 'revolution' is used to indicate a change in socio-political systems
 raajnneetik siddhant ke antargat krati vah he jo kisi desh main raajnneetik satta ke aakasmik parivartan se aarambh hoti he or phir vahiin ke raamaajik jivan ko nae rup main dhaal detii he
 Simpleism: The revolution takes place in a particular socio-political situation
 jeff gudwin kranti kii do paribhaashaayen dete hai
 There is a broad, according to which the revolution is or ek sankeern he, jisamen Jack Goldstone defines them as saying raajnneetik or saamaajik krantiyon kaa adhyayan anekon saamaajik vigyaan ke antargat kiya gaya he, visheshtah samajashaastra, raajnneetishastra or itihaas ke antargat
 is kshetra ke agrani vidwaanon main kraine brinton, charles brocket, farideh farhi, jon foran, jon mason heart, samuel hantington, jaik goldstone, jeff gudwin, ted roberts gur, fred heliday, chammers johnson, tim mike'danniel, bairington moore, jeffri pej, wilfredo pereto, terrence ranger, ujin rosenstock-huse, theda scock paul, james scot, erik celbin, charles tili, ellen ke trimbringer, carlos vistas, jon volton, timothy vikhem-krole or erik woolf aadi rahe hai yaa abhi bhi hai
 Revolution scholars, such as Jack Goldstone, distinguish scholarly research regarding revolutions as four current generations
 pehali peedi ke vidvan jaise ki gustav lee boun, charles e
 alwood yaa pitirim sorokin kii paddati mukhyatah varnanaatmak thi or krantiyon ke tathy ke liye unke dwaara die gaye spashtikaran aam taur par saamaajik manovigyaan se sambandhit the, jaise ki lee boun kaa croud psychology siddhant
 Second generation theorists wanted to develop detailed theories about the causes and times of the early revolutions, which was rooted in more complex social behavioral theories
 inhen teen pramukh paddatiyon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he: manovaigyanik, samajashaastra sambandhi or raajnneetik
 Ted Robert Gurr, Evo K
 Fairbrand, Rosalind L
 Fairbrand, James A
 Geschwander, David C
 Swartz and Denton E
 Morrison, fall under the first category
 unhone sangyanatmak manovigyaan or kuntha-aakraamakata siddhant kaa anusaran kiya or dekha ki kranti kaa kaaran aam janata kii maansik avasthaa he, jabaki is sandarbh main un logon ke bich mat vibhed tha ki vastav main logon ne kis kaaran se vidroh kiya, ve sabhi is baat par sahamat ho gaye ki kranti kaa praathmik kaaran saamaajik-raajnneetik avasthaa ke prati vyapak str par faili hui kuntha thi
 The second group, Chalmers Johnson, Neil Smelser, Bob Jessoup, Mark Hart, Edward A
 Tiryakian, created by academics such as Mark Hagopian, followed Talcaut Parsons and the structural-procedural theory of sociology; He observed that society as a whole is in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems
 jaisaa ki sabhi manovaigyanik vichaardhaaraon main hota he, usee prakaar asantulan ke kaarnon kii paribhaasha ke sambandh main unka mat alag-alag tha, lekin is baat par vah sahamat the ki gambhir asantulan hi kranti ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Finally the third group, consisting of Charles Tilley, Samuel P
 Huntington, Peter Emman, and Arthur L
 Writers such as Stinkokoumbe, followed the path of political science and relied on polytheistic theory and interest group conflict theory
 ye siddhanth maanate hai ki yah ghatnaayen do pratispardhaatmak hit samooh ke madhya adhikaar sangharsh kaa parinaam hai
 In this type of model, revolutions occur when two or more groups are unable to agree in a simple decision-making process, which is traditional for any political system, and at the same time they have an army appointment to pursue their goals
 Adequate resources are available for duusari peedi ke siddhantavaadiyon ne dekha ki krantiyon kaa vikaas ek dohari prakriya he; pehle, vartmaan avasthaa main kuch parivartan aisa parinaam dete hai jo bhootkaal ke parinaamon se bhinn hai; doosraa, nayi avasthaa kranti ke ghatit hone ke liye ek avasar pradaan karti he
 In such a state, an event which was not sufficient to cause revolution in the past, is now enough for it - although if the authorities are conscious of such dangers, then even in this stage, they can stop the protest
 krantiyon se sambandhit anekon praarambhik adhyayanon ne chaar moulik muddon par kendrit hone kaa prayaas kiya- prasidd evam vivaad rahit udhaaharan joki vastav main krantiyon kii sabhi paribhaashaon ke liye sateek he, jaise ki glorious rivolushan, francisi kranti, 1917 kii roosi kranti or chini kranti 
 However, the famous Harvard historian, Crane Brinton, in his famous book "the Anatomy of Revolution" focused on the English Civil War, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution
 samay ke saath, vidvan anya saikadon ghatnaon kaa vishleshan bhi kranti ke rup main karne lage or unki paribhaashaon va paddatiyon main antar ne nayi paribhaasha va spashtikaran ko janm diya
 Second-generation theories have been criticized for their limited geographical spread, difficulties of empirical verification, as well as the fact that although they explain some particular revolutions, they do not provide any explanation that under these circumstances other societies Why did the rebellions not happen in India? duusari peedi kii alochana ke kaaran siddhanton kii teesri peedi kaa janm hua, jisame theda scockpaul, barington moore, jeffri pej or anya lekhak shaamil the joki pracheen marxvaadi varg sangharsh madhyam ke aadhaar par vistaar kar rahe the, vah apana dhyaan gramin krishi rajya sangharsh, ucchwargeey logon ke saath hone vaale rajya sangharsh or antarrajiya aarthik va sainya pratispardhaa dwaara gharelu raajnneetik parivartan par padane vaale prabhaav kii ore kendrit kar rahe the
 In particular, Skokpaul's States and Social Revolutions became one of the most popular works of the third generation; Skoukpaul, while explaining the revolution, said, "it is a rapid, fundamental transformation of society's states and class structure
" 

joki nimna str ke varg aadhaarit vidrohon ke dwaara samarthit va sweekrut hota he" or unhone krantiyon ko rajya, ucchvarg or nimna varg se sambandhit vibhinn sangharshon ke liye uttaradaayi tehraaya
 From the late 1980s a new body of scholarly works began to question the efficacy of third generation theories
 puraane siddhanton ko bhi nayi krantikari ghatnaon ke dwaara khaasaa aghat laga jo unke dwaara saralata se vyakt nahin kiya ja sakaa
 In 1979, the Irani and the Nrikguan Revolutions, the Manpower Revolution in the Philippines in 1986 and the Autum of Nations in Europe in 1989, witnessed the fact that multi-class coincidences demolished many powerful seeming regimes in popular demonstrations and mass strikes in non-violent revolutions
 
 ab kranti yaa vidroh ko europea hinsak avasthaa banaam janata yaa varg sangharsh ke rup main paribhaashit karnaa paryaapt nahin tha
 Thus the study of revolutions developed in three directions, first, some researchers were applying previous or updated structural theories of the revolution in relation to events that were not previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts
 Secondly, according to scholars, in order to shape the revolutionary mobilization and goals in the form of ideological beliefs and culture, more attention was needed to the conscious institution
 teesraa, krantiyon or saamaajik aandolanon, donon hi kshetra ke vishleshkon ne yah anubhav kiya ki donon tathyon ke bich kaaphi kuch ubhaynishth he or vivadpurn raajnneeti ke ek nae 'chauthi peedi' ke sahitya kaa vikaas hua joki donon tathyon ko samajhane kii aashaa main saamaajik aandolanon or krantiyon donon ke hi parigyanon ko jodne kaa prayaas karata he
 Although the revolutions, including the Communist Revolution which was relatively peaceful and that overthrown the Communist regime, also included Afghanistan's violent revolution, under the Revolution, it also called the Copse d'étatas, civil war, rebellions and such treason

 saamaajik vigyaan or sahitya main krantiyon ke anekon bhinn varg vigyaan hai
 For example, the ancient scholar Alexis de Touqueville described 1) political revolutions and 2) emergent and violent revolutions that seek not only to establish a new political system but to transform the entire society and 3) slow but widespread transformation of the overall society Which takes many generations to fully come into its form

 Charles Tilley, a modern scholar of the revolution, has distinguished between a coup, a right-to-confiscation, a civil war, a rebellion and a "great revolution"
 anya prakaar kii krantiyaan, jinka nirmaan anya varg vigyaan ke liye kiya gaya he, uname saamaajik krantiyaan; shramjivi varg yaa communist krantiyaan shaamil hai jo marxvad ke vichaaron se prabhavit hai or poonjeevaad ko communistwad se sthanantharitt karne kaa lakshya rakhte hai); asafal yaa apurna krantiyaan yaa hinsak banaam ahimsak krantiyaan
 The term "revolution" is also used to indicate the vast changes that have taken place outside the political sphere

04222 After nearly half a century of turmoil and honor at the hands of the Shaka rulers, Gautami reestablished his lost reputation under the leadership of son Shatkarni
 gautami putr shri shatakarni satvaahan vansh kaa sabase mahaan shaasha tha jisane lagbhag 25 varshon tak shashan karte hue na keval apane samrajya kii khoi pratishtha ko purnsthapit kiya apitu ek vishaal samrajya kii bhi sthapana kii
 In the time of Gautami's son and his victories, we get complete information from the Nashik inscriptions of his mother Gautami Balashree
 uske sandarbh main hamen is lekh se yah jaankaree milti he ki usne kshatriyon ke ahankaar kaa maan-mardan kiya tha
 He is described as the doer of the rulers of Shaka, Yavana and Pahlavas
 uski sabase badi uplabdhi kshahraat vansh ke shaq shaasha nahpaan tathaa uske vanshajon kii uske haathon hui paraajay thi
 The silver coins of Nahapan obtained from the Jogalthambi group which Gautami's son Shatkarni reintroduced and in the eighteenth year of his reign, by Gautami's son making a cavity at Pandu-lan near Nashik - these are some of the facts that prove that he Rejuvenated the territories taken away by the Shaka rulers
 nahpaan ke saath unka yuddh uske shashan kaal ke 17wein or 18wein varsh main hua tathaa is yuddh main jeet kar rgatmi putr ne aparant, anup, saurashtra, cooker, akar tathaa avanti ko nahpaan se chin liya
 Apart from these areas, Gautami's son also had dominion over Rishik, Ayamak, Moolak and Vidarbha etc
 uske pratyaksh prabhaav main rahane vaala kshetra uttar main malwa tathaa kathiyawad se lekar dakshin main krishna nadi tak tathaa puvai main baraar se lekar pashchim main konkan tak failaa hua tha
 He assumed the title 'tri-sea-toy-yellow-vehicle', indicating that his influence was in the eastern, western and southern seas, that is, the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean
 aisa prathit hota he ki apni mrityu ke kuch samay pehle gautami putr shatakarni dwaara nahpaan ko haraakar jite gaye kshetra uske haath se nikal gaye
 Those who snatched these territories from Gautami's son were probably the Shaka rulers of the Kardamak dynasty of the Scythian race
 iskaa pramaan hamen talami dwaara bhugol kaa varnan karti uski pustak se miltaa he
 a similar conclusion can also be drawn from the famous Rudradaman inscription of Junagadh of 150 AD
 yah shilaalekh darshata he ki nahpaan se vijit gautamiputra shatakarni ke sabhi pradeshon ko usase rudradaman ne hathiyaa liya
 It appears that Gautamiputra Shatkarni attempted to secure his territories captured by Rudradaman by establishing matrimonial relations with the Kardamak Shakas

 ham jaanate hai ki pratidin nagar evam shaharon se vyarth-jal kii ek bahut badi maatr janit hoti he
 The major component of this waste water is the excreta of man
 nagar ke is vyarth jal ko wahiwamal bhi kehete hai
 It contains large amounts of organic matter and microorganisms which are mostly pathogenic
 wahiwamal kii badi maatr athwa shahari vyarthjal kaa rojaanaa niptaan kaise kiya jaay? ise prakritik jal sroton jaise nadi, jharne main sidhe visarjeet nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Before immersion, sewage is treated in the sewage plant so that it becomes pollution free
 sookshmjeev pratidin vishvabhar main vyarth jal ke lakhon-karodon galen pani ke upachaar main mahatvapurn bhoomika-nibhaate hai
 This system has been used in almost all parts of the world for centuries
 aaj ke din tak koi bhi manushya dwaara taiyaar kii gai praudyogiki wahit mel ke sookshmjivi upachaar ke saamne nahin tik pai
 Due to increasing urbanization, a much larger quantity of sewage is generated than before, hence the number of these treatment plants has not been increased enough to treat such a large quantity of sewage
 isliye apchaarit wahiwamal ko sidhe hi nadiyon main chhod diya jaataa he
 As a result, the number of pollution and water borne diseases is increasing
 vyarth jal kaa upachaar parposhit sookshmjeev se kiya jaataa he jo wahit mel main prakritik rup se vaas karte hai
 This treatment is performed in the following two stages- praathmik upachaar - upachaar ke is charan main wahit mel se bade-chote kanon ko nisyandan tathaa avsaadan dwaara bhautik rup se alag kar diya jaataa hai
 They are separated into different stages
 aarambh main tairte hue kooday-karkat ko anukramik nisyandan dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 The chitabalukasham is then expelled by sedimentation
 sabhi thos jo praathmik aanpak ke neeche baithe kan hai, vah or plavi bahirisrav kaa nirmaan karata he
 The effluent is transported from the primary filtration tank for secondary treatment
 dwitiyak upachaar athwa jeev vigyaneey upachaar - praathmik bahirisrav ko bade vayuviya tinkon main se guzaara jaataa he jahaan yah lagaataar yantric rup se hilaayaa jaataa he or vaayu ko isamen pump kiya jaataa he
 This results in strong vigorous growth of beneficial airborne microorganisms in the form of energy
 vruddhi ke dauraan yah sookshmjeev bahirisrav main upasthit carbonic padaarthon ke pramukh bhaagon kii khapat karata he
 This significantly reduces the BOD of the effusion
 bi o di oxigen kii us maatr ko sanderbhit karata he jo jeevanu dwaara ek litre pani main upasthit carbonic padaarthon kii khapat kar unhen oxikrut kar den
 Sewage is treated until the BOD is reduced
 jal ke ek namoonay main sookshmjiviyon dwaara oxigen ke udgrahan kii dar kaa maapan bi o di pareekshan se kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, the measurement of organic matter present indirectly in water is BOD
 jab vyarth-jal kaa bi o di adhik hoga, tab isaki pradooshan kshamta bhi adhik hogi
 Once the BOD of sewage or waste water is reduced to a sufficient amount, the effluent is sent to the effluent tank where the bacterial herds convert it into sediment

 This mixture of gases is called biogas
 chunki yah gas jvalansheel hoti hai, is kaaran inkaa prayog urja ke strot ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 The effluent from the secondary treatment plant is usually released into natural sources of water such as rivers, springs
 biogas kai gaison kaa mishran he tathaa sookshmjivi sakriyata dwaara utpann hoti he
 We know that during growth and metabolism, microorganisms produce various types of gaseous products
 jo gas utpann hoti he, vah in sookshmjiviyon dwaara khapat kiye gaye carbonic padaarthon par nirbhar karti he
 CO2 gas is mainly produced in the fermentation of wet flour, cheese manufacturing and production of beverages
 yadhyapi kuch bacteria jo sailulogy padaarthon par avayuviya rup se ugte hai vah CO2 tathaa H2 ke saath-saath badi maatr main methane bhi utpann karte hai
 These bacteria are collectively called methanogens

 Similarly, these bacteria are found in abundance in animal feces

 Hence, they are used to produce biogas, which is also commonly called 'dung gas'
