 adivasee jinka jangalo se kaaphi purana rishta rahaa he
 Situated in the middle of the dense forest of Satpurachal, the fort of King Il is still surrounded by lush green fields and barns, but yesterday it was surrounded by forest and wild animals
 adivasee hone ke kaaran raja 'iló ke kile kaa pravesh dwaar 70 se 80 feet ooncha hone ke kaaran vah kisi bhi sidhe hamalaa kaa us par koi asar nahin padataa tha

 ek sthal par use ‘som’ se utpann kaha gaya he
 At the time of his birth, the earth-earth shook
 indra ke janm ko vidyut ke megh-vichyut hone kaa pratik mana ja saktaa he

 His chariot is golden
 do harith varna ashwon dwaara wahit us rath kaa nirmaan dev-shilpi rubhuon dwaara kiya gaya tha
 The Indrakrita Vritra-slaughter is frequently and often described and mentioned in the Rigveda
 som kii maadakta se utprerit ho, praayah marudganon ke saath, vah ‘vrutra’ athwa ‘ahi’ naamak daityon par akraman karke apane vajra se unka vadh kar daalata he or parvat ko bhed kar bandikrut gaayon ke samaan avaruddh jalon ko vinirmukt kar detaa he
 The place of the above demons is nothing but 'mountain' clouds, which they penetrate for water release
 isi prakaar gaayon ko avaruddh kar rakhane vaali prastar-shilaayein bhi jal-nirodhak megh hi hai
 The cloud is also the region in which the aforesaid demons reside
 in prasaadon kii sankhya kahin 90, kahin 99 to kahin 100 batalaai gai he, jinka vidhwans karke indra ‘purabhid’ virud dhaaran karata he
 Along with the water-slaughtering of vrittra or ahi, the light has also been described to be made uncontrolled
 us vrutra yaa ahi ko maar kar indra surya ko sabake liye drushtigochar bana detaa he
 Here the said vritra or ahi means either the obstructive cloud of sunlight, or the nocturnal darkness
 surya or ushas ke saath jin gaayon kaa ullekh miltaa he, ve praatah kaalik surya kii kirnon kaa hi praturup hai, jo ki apane krishnabh awaas-sthal se baahar nikalati hai
 In this way, the privacy of Indra also becomes well known

 It is also said that - 'yo Brahmano nadhamanasya kire: xxrep 13 
 avita'
 uski sahaayta ke bina vijaylabh asambhav he
 That is why warriors and soldiers invoke it for victory and for their protection
 yah baat nimnlikhit mantra se or bhi spasht ho jaati he :-‘yan krandasi sanyati vihvayete parevar ubhaya amitrah
 Saman chidrathamatasthivansa nana hawate sa janas indra
 
 ' indra aaryon ko anaryon ke viruddh yuddh main sahaayta pradaan kar unhen vijayi banaata he
 Herein he abuses things and kills his detractors and opponents
 vah jis par prasann hua, use samrudh or jis par aprasann hua, use krush bana detaa he
 Due to the influence of his Tattad qualities, horse, cow, village and rathadi remain in his control
 is prakaar vah nikhil vishwa kaa pratinidhi he
 Even the deity deserves his grace
 indra ne asthir prithvi ko sthery pradaan kiya he
 Indra has installed them on the plank by piercing the wings of the mountains flying here and there
 usne dyu-lok ko bhi stabdh kiya or is prakaar antariksh kaa nirmaan kiya
 In the middle of two clouds is the electric fire or in the middle of two stone blocks is the father of normal fire
 indra ko surya or hawa ushaa kaa udbhaavak bhi kaha gaya he
 He is the motivator of space or surface waters
 isiilie use varsha kaa devtaa maanate hai
 There is no one apart from Indra who is not only the earth, but also the one who stabilizes the whole world
 isse ‘usne sabhi padaarthon ko gatiman banaaya’ yah arth grahan karne par bhi indra kaa mahatmaya nahin ghatata
 Indra discovered the monster named 'shambar' hidden in the dreaded mountains in the 40th year and killed it
 bal-pradarshan karne vaale ‘ahi’ naamak daanav kaa bhi usne sanhaar kiya
 By killing the said ‘ahi’, Indra made seven rivers such as the dedicating waters or the Ganges flow

 a monster called Bal had kept innumerable cows in his enclosure
 un gaayon kii lokkalyanarth balpurvak baahar nikaalane kaa shrey indra ko hi he
 Some scholars destroy the polar cosmic darkness by Indra in the sun form or destroy the extreme cold that accumulates on the waters, or the release of water from the non-ferocious clouds, by the worship of non-destruction, chitra-slaughter, shambar-slaughter and force-killing
 We imagine the release of the sun-like cows covered with clouds, which do not seem far from the truth
 ‘yah sompa’ kah kar rishi ne indra kii durvyasan-parata kii ore bhi ingit kiya he
 'som' is Indra's favorite drink
 uske baraabar koi anya devtaa som-paan nahin kar saktaa
 'som' gives him strength and vigor for wars
 som-sevi hone ke kaaran indra ko ve log parampriy hai, jo som kaa abhishav karte hai athwa pakaa kar use siddh karte hai
 He protects such people
 itnaa hi nahin, aise priy vyaktiyon ko vah dhan-vaibhav se puraskrit bhi karata he
 The second thing is that she is found to be soma, slays her apostles with her armament thunderbolt, is downgrader to shudras or hell to her apostles, yet she is utterly revered because of her other virtues
 dyavapruthivi ke praani use sadaa naman karte hai
 People pray to him that 'O Indra! We should always be ready in your prayers, having a beautiful son and grandson and have become your beloved
 ’ It is thus clear that Indra occupies the paramount and best position among the Vedic deities
 indra kii charitavali main vrutravadh kaa bada mahatva he
 In the Rigveda, the name of Indra also comes in seven Dev-pairs
 aise yugmon main 11 sookt indra-agni ke liye hai, 9 sookt indra-varun ke liye, 7 indra-vaayu ke liye, 2 indra-som, 2 indra-brihaspati, 1 indra-vishnu or 1 sookt indra-pushan ke liye hai
 Indra has similarities with all of them and there are differences
 udhaaharan ke liye indra or varun ke yugma ko liya ja saktaa he
 Although Varuna is described in very few verses, he is considered the most important after Indra
 9 sookhton main indra or varun kaa sanyukt varnan he
 The two have many similarities
 kaha gaya he ki jagat ke adhipati indravarun ne saritaaon ke path khode or surya ko dhuloak main gatiman banaaya
 They beat the circle
 yuddh main sahaayak hai
 Conquers worshipers
 krurkarma pamaron par apana amogh vajra phenkate hai
 Despite these similarities, both also have many contrasts: - upanishdon main swaabhaavik vishayanusaar yada-kada indra ko bhi gyaan-prapti hetu utsuk dikhaaya gaya he
 One such story is being given from the Chandyopopanishad: - Prajapati had said that whoever knows a soul devoid of sinless, noxious, death-mourning, etc
, attains the whole world and all desires
 prajapati kii ukti sunakar devtaa tathaa asur donon hi us aatma ko jaanane ke liye utsuk ho uthe, at: devataaon ke raja indra tathaa asuron ke raja virochan paraspar irshyaabhaav ke saath haathon main samidhaayen lekar prajapati ke paas pahunche
 Both practiced celibacy for thirty-two years, then Prajapati asked for the purpose of his arrival
 unki jigyaasa jaanakar prajapati ne unhen sundar vastralankaran se yukt hokar jal se aapurit sakore main swayan ko dekhne ke liye kaha or bataaya ki vahi aatma he
 Seeing their reflection in both the Sakras, they walked away satisfied
 prajapati ne sochaa ki dev hon yaa asur, aatma kaa saakshaatkaar kiye bina uskaa paraabhav hoga
 Virochan reached out to the asuras with a satisfied mind and told them that the soul is worshipable
 uski paricharya karke manushya donon lok praapt kar letaa he
 Before reaching the Gods, Indra thought that wearing a jewelery in Sakore shows a fitted form, a fragmented body of a fragmented body, a blind form of the blind, then how did this azar-immortal soul become? He again reached Prajapati
 prajapati ne indra ko pun: battis varsh apane paas rakhaa taduparant bataaya-'jo swapn main poojit hota hua vichrata he, vahi aatma, amrit, abhaya tathaa brahm hai
 Indra again appeared in Prajapati's service with doubt
 is prakaar teen baar battis-battis varsh tak tathaa ek baar paanch varsh tak indra ko brahmacharyavas main rakhkar prajapati ne unhen aatma ke swaroop kaa purna gyaan kuch is tarah karavaaya :- Indra does not have a place in the mythological deity that is in the Vedic pantheon
 puranic devmandal main trimurti-brahma, vishnu or shiv kaa mahatv bad jaataa he
 Indra is still considered as Devadhiraja
 vah dev-lok kii rajdhani amravati main rahata he
 Here Nandan is forest, Parijat and Kalpavriksha
 sudharma uski rajsabha tathaa sahasr mantriyon kaa uskaa mantrimandal he
 Shachi or Indrani is wife, Airavat elephant and Astra Vajra or Ashani
 inke ghode kaa naam ucchanshrava he
 Whenever a human wants to get Indrapad by his penance, the throne of Indra gets in trouble
 apane singhaasana kii raksha ke liye indra praaia: tapasviyon ko apsaraon se mohit kar pathbhrasht karata hua paaya jaataa he
 Many stories of this relationship are found in the Puranas
 puranic indra shaktimaan, samrudh or vilaasi raja ke rup main chitrit he
 Despite having many powers and being a valid king, sometimes he has been shown to be unrestrained and tearful, due to which he has also been declining
 durvasa ke shaap se patan kii ek katha aage di ja rahi he
 Once, Durvasa Rishi blessed Indra with a garland of childlike flowers received from Vidyadhari
 indra ko aishwarya kaa itnaa mad tha ki unhone vah pushp apane hathi ke mastak par rakh diya
 Due to the effect of the flower, the elephant got attracted by its fragrance and sniffed it and threw it on the earth
 indra use sanbhaalane main asamarth rahe
 Durvasa cursed him to be Shrihin
 amravati bhi atyant bhrasht ho chali
 Indra first reached Jupiter's and then Brahma's refuge
 samast devtaa vishnu ke paas gayi
 He commanded Lakshmi to be the ocean-daughter
 at: lakshmi sagar main chali gayi
 Vishnu, describing the various situations of abandonment of Lakshmi, ordered him to churn the ocean
 manthan se jo anek ratna nikle, unamem lakshmi bhi thi
 Lakshmi pleased Narayana by giving her a garland
 lakshmi ne devon ko trilok se ab virahit nahin hone kaa vardaan diya
 The king of the gods was called Indra
 valmikiy ramayana main varnit he ki meghagiri naamak parvat par devataaon ne harith rang ke ashv vaale paakshasan indra ko raja ke pad par abhishikt kiya tha
 In the Ramayana, he is considered the god of rain
 gautam ke shaap ke parinamswaroop unhen meshavrushan bhi kaha gaya he
 In the Ramayana, he is depicted as a tough ruler, great warrior, Vishwavandya Lokpal and sympathetic deity as well as luxuriant, jealous and conspirator
 inhone trishanku ko swarg main pahunchaa dekhakar use vahaan se ulta gira diya
 He kidnapped the sacrificial fire of Ambareesh
 ambarish ne jab richik ke manjhale putr shunagashep ko yajna-pashu banaaya to shunagashep kii stuti se prasann hokar inhone use bachaaya tathaa dderghaayu banaaya
 Respect for them and a sense of protection from the crisis remains in the public
 van-yatra main ram kii raksha ke liye kausalya indra kaa bhi aahvaan karti he
 His conspiratorial form also appears in Ramayana
 ek satyawadee or pavitra tapasvi kii tapasya main vighn daalane ke liye inhone apana uttam khadg dharohar ke rup main use de diya tha
 Vedic Indra was not afraid
 ramayana main indra bhi ravan ke bhay se kaanp uthte the
 Indra became peacock after seeing Ravana present at the time of the sacrifice of Marutha
 haalaanki inaki veerta asandigdh rahi he
 For his marriage to Shachi, he killed Puli, Shachi's father, and Anhulad who defeated Shachi by deceit
 ravan ke swarg par akraman ke samay devsena ko vinasht hote dekhakar inhone bina kisi ghabrahat ke ravan kaa saamana kar use yuddh se vimukh kar diya tha
 Meghnad was able to arrest them with the help of Maya
 ram-ravan yuddh dekhakar dev-gandharv-kinnaron ne kaha ki yah yuddh samaan nahin he kyonki ravan ke paas to rath he or ram paidal hai
 So Indra sent his chariot to Ram, which also had Indra's armor, huge bow, arrow and power
 vineet bhav se haath jodakar matli ne ramchandra se kaha ki ve rathadi vastuon ko grahan karen or jaise mahan indra daanvon kaa sanhaar karte hai, usee tarah ravan kaa vadh karen
 After the end of the war, Rama ordered Matali to return Indra's chariot
 indra ke prasang main kuch log ahalya kii puranic katha ko managasaint vaidic sandarbh dekar uski manamaani vyakhya karke apni vidwata kaa anarthak pradarshan karte hai
 By the way, in the name of the Vedic context, Ahalya means 'land without plowing'
 is sandarbh main anivarytah dhyatavya pehali baat yah he ki rugveda main 'ahalya' yaa 'ahilya' shabd kaa prayog hua hi nahin he
 Not only the Rigveda, other Vedic Samhita texts also do not have this word
 brahman granthon main iskaa ullekh maatr he
 In the Shatapatha Brahmin, the word 'ahalyai Jar' is used for Indra
 spashtatah yah prayog usee katha kii ore sanket karata he jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana aadi granthon main he
 Secondly, the word 'plow' is also not used in the Rigveda
 krishikarya main prayukt hal ke liye rugveda main 'langal' shabd kaa prayog hua he
 The second word used for the plow is 'sira', in other Samhita texts and Brahmins, 'plow' is not used
 vastutah hal kaa prayog vedangon ke samay main sambhavtah aarambh hua hoga or loukik sanskrit main hi iskaa adhik prayog hua he
 In such a situation, the aforesaid interpretation of Ahalya is at least different or far from Vedic references
 rahi pratikatmak vyakhya kii baat to vah to anekanek puranic kathaon ke liye sambhav he or aise praytn hote bhi rahe hai
 But by concocting the legend of Indra and Ahalya by concocting Vedic scriptures to prove the divinity of Rama as the imagery of the poets of Ramkatha, it is really a matter of revealing their factual disloyalty to Rama and God, which is really a matter of personal recognition; It is totally unsuitable for any knowledge material
 valmikiy ramayana main indra-ahalya prasang kii katha di gayi he
 Indra had abducted Gautama's wife Ahalya
 kahani is prakaar he- shacheepati indra ne ashram se gautam kii anupasthiti jaanakar or muni kaa vesh dhaaran kar ahalya se kaha
 
 17
 
 he ati sundari! kamijan bhogavilas ke liye ritukal kii pratiksha nahin karte, arthath yah baat nahin maanate ki jab stri masik dharm se nivruth hon keval tabhi unke saath samagam karnaa chahie
 Therefore, o beautiful waistcoat! i want to meet with you 
 18
 
 Vishwamitra says that o Raghunandan! Even after recognizing Indra, the idol Munevikadhari, with the idea that 'devraj Indra himself wants me', agreed to this proposal
 
 19
 
 After that, he was satisfied and said to God, the best among the gods, o Surottam! i was grateful ab aap yahaan se sheeghra chale jaaiye
 
 20
 
 tab indra ne bhi hanste hue kaha ki he sundar nitambon vaali! main purna santusht hum
 Now i will go from where i came
 is prakaar ahalya ke saath sangam kar vah kutiyaa se niklaa
 This episode is described in a very human form in the Valmiki Ramayana
 yahan ahalya ke pathar yaa nadi hone kaa ullekh bhi nahin he
 It has been said in the curse that she will remain hidden most of the time
 vaayu pikar hi arthath upwas karti hui rahegi or ram ke aane par unka aatithy-satkar karne par purv rup main aa jaaegi
 It is also written clearly about the end of the curse that it was difficult for anyone to see Ram before seeing him, after seeing Ram, he started seeing everyone
 isse puri tarah spasht he ki shila yaa nadi hone kii kalpana valmikiy ramayana se bahut baad kii he
 In order to establish the superiority of the trinity and the importance of Indra was continuously reduced, all the blame was put on Indra itself and the character of Ahalya was considered holy
 katipay vidwaanon ne is katha ko pratikatmak arth dene kaa praytn kiya he
 The use of mystic terminology in religious texts has been in vogue since ancient times and Vedic terminology used to be icing on gold, so the above statement can also be symbolic
 vishleshan karne par bhinn-bhinn arth saamne aate hai:- In temporal Sanskrit, Ahalya means "without plow" meaning barren land
 jaisaa ki gyaat hi he indra duusare deshon par akraman karata tha to parinaam swaroop hari-bhari bhoomi banjar ho jaati thi indra, is bhojan ke strot yaa jangal ke strot jisase fal, kand-mul aadi milte the unhen nasht kar ke apane dushmano ko nuksaan pahunchaata tha
 Later, when Vishwamitra told Rama that it is Ahalya, he may mean that it is "without plow" i
e
 wasteland, make it fertile and Rama has made that land fertile again
 doosraa prasang 'nadi' ke sandarbh main 'brahmpurana " or "anand ramayana " ke anusaar ho saktaa he
 The word 'sira' in Apabhramsa has two meanings, one is stone and the other is dry river
 jaisaa krishi ke rup main vishleshan kiya gaya he usee tarah yah bhi ho saktaa he ki vastut: koi nadi hogi jo indra ke dushman desh main jaati hogi or uske mukhya pani ke strot ko indra ne sukha diya hoga taaki dushman desh ko pani na mil sake or baad main ram ne ise jalayukt banaaya hoga
 In this way, Ahalya-incident is just humanization of nature
 mahabharat main indra kaa puranic swaroop hi miltaa he
 Here the pride described in Vedic literature is no more
 inhen visheshtah 'shakr' naam se sambodhit kiya gaya he
 The fear of losing his Devaraj position makes him persecute and he tries his best to avoid it
 vishwamitra ke tap se bhaybheet hokar menka naamak apsara ko unka tap bhang karne bheja
 Fearing the tenacity of Shardwat, Apsara named Janapadi sent her to dissolve her tenacity
 yavakrit ke tap se bhaybheet hokar indra ne ek brahman kaa rup dhaaran kar unhen tap se virat kiya
 The mention of the Ahalya-passage mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana is also found in the Mahabharata
 yahan use balaat-kaary mana gaya he
 In the Mahabharata, the narrative support of Indra being 'harishmashru' mentioned in the Rigveda is also found
 yahan kaha gaya he ki gautam ke shaap ke kaaran hi indra ko harishmashru hona padaa
 He was the father of Arjuna
 vritrasur ke bhay se sabhi devataaon ne apni shaktiyaan inhen samarpit kar di thi
 Therefore Arjuna was asked to get the divya from him
 inase sambandhit anek kahaniyaan mahabharat main di gayi hai
 Indra is literally the name of a post
 devataaon ke raja ke pad ko 'indra' kehete hai
 The name of the person sitting on that post also becomes Indra
 iske sanket to anek puranic kathaon evam vivaranon main miltaa he, parantu mahabharat ke anek sandarbhon se yah bhaleebhanti spasht ho jaataa he ki yah ek pad kaa naam he
 The stories in which these positions are afraid of being snuffed out become clear when looking at the stories of other persons to become Indra with those stories
 anek jagah 'indra' shabd kaa vyaktivachi prayog na hokar padvachi prayog hua he
 Some reference sightings are: - shiv ne indra ko moorchhit kar purvakaal ke anya chaar indron ke saath ek gupha main daal diya
 Narakasura, who aspires for Indrapad, was killed by Vishnu
 shakr ke netritv main rishiyon, devataaon ne skanda se devon kaa 'indra' banane ke liye kaha
 Nahush became 'indra' when he left the Indra post of Shakra, after suffering from Brahmana
 baad main nahush kaa patan hone par vishnu ke aadeshaanusaar ashwamedh yajna kaa anushthan karke shakr ne punah indra-pad praapt kiya
 Apart from these, many explicit references to the post of Indra are available in Mahabharata
 vishnupurana main tritiy ansh ke pratham evam dwitiya adhyay main tathaa bhagwat mahapurana ke ashtum skandh ke pratham evam trayodash adhyay main 14 manvantaron ke alag-alag indron ke naam diye gayi hai
 The eighteenth treaty of Mahakavi Swayambhu's famous 'paum Chariu' epic tells the story of a man who was inspired by Devaraj Indra and wanted to do everything with his name
 rathnoopur nagar ke vidyadhar raja sahasraar kii sunitambini pinpayodhara patni kaa naam tha maanas sundari
 The son he got from Surshri was named Indra
 indra jab raja bana to sahaayak vidyadharon main se mantri kaa naam rakhaa brihaspati, hathi airavat, isi prakaar pawan, kuber, varun, yama or chandra tathaa apni gayikaon ke naam urvashi, rambha, tilottama aadi rakhkar ghoshit kiya ki indra ke jo-jo chihn hai ve mere bhi hai
 i am the Lord of the Earth
 uski samruddhi kii baat sunakar lanka ke shaasha rakshas maali ne apane bhai sumali tathaa vishaal sena ke saath akraman kiya
 After the pitched battle, Rakshasaraja was killed and Sumali entered Patal Lanka

 shribhagwat main bharatvarsh kii mahima ke pratipadak aathon shloke devi bhagwat main aksharsh: usee kram main uddhrut hai 
 The difference in the descriptions of the two is so much that where the Srimad Bhagavat takes a natural medium of prose for the sake of the description of the subject, Devi Bhagwat uses the artificial medium of the verse to demonstrate the uniqueness
 shrimadbhagwat bhakthiras tathaa aadhyatmagyaan kaa samanvay upasthit karata he
 The Bhagavata is considered to be the self-sufficiency of Nigamakalpataru, which has been made amritamay by the natural brahmachari and the great scientist Maharishi Shuk, combined with his melodious speech

 Shankaracharya's grandfather Guru Gaudapadacharya has quoted two verses of Bhagavat in his 'panchakaranavyakhya', 'jagruhe Paurusam Rupam' and 'shrey: Srutiin Bhakti Mudasya te Vibho' in 'uttaragita Tika'
 isse bhagwat kii rachana saptam shatee se arvachin nahin maani ja sakati

 Ashtaghapi, Nimbarki, Radhavallabhi poets of Braj Bhasha took radiance and inspiration from Bhagwat, singing Radha Krishna's leelas in Brajbhasha
 mithila ke vidyapati, bengal ke chandidas, gyaandas tathaa govinddas, assam ke shankardev tathaa madhavdev, utkal ke upendra bhanj tathaa dinkrishnadas, maharashtra ke namdev tathaa madhav pandit, gujarat ke narsi mehta tathaa rajasthan kii mirabai - in sabhi santon tathaa kaviyon ne bhagwat ke rasmay varnan se prerana praapt kar radhakrishna kii kamaneey keli kaa gayan apane vibhinn kaavyon main kiya he
 The influence of Bhagwat on the Vaishnava poets of Tamil, Andhra, Kannada and Malayalam is also less
 bhagwat kaa aadhyatmik drushtikon advaitvaad kaa he tathaa sadhanadrushti bhakthi kii he
 Thus the symmetry of devotion with Advaita is Bhagavata's own peculiarity

 Manas or Manas can refer to the following: acharya vinoba bhaave bharat ke swatantraaa sangram senaanee, saamaajik kaaryakarta tathaa prasiddh gandhivadi netaa the
 His original name was Vinayak Narhari Bhave
 unhe bharat kaa rashtriya aadhyaapak or mahatma gandhi kaa aadhyaatamik uttaradhikari samajha jaataa he
 He spent the last year of his life in an ashram in Ponar, Maharashtra
 unhone bhudaan aandolan chalaaya
 He was also in dispute for calling the Emergency declared by Indira Gandhi a 'discipline festival'
 vinoba bhaave kaa mul naam vinayak narhari bhaave tha

 unki mata rukmini bai vidhushi mahila thim
 Liberal-minded, all eight Yam were immersed in devotion
 It also affected their daily work
 man kahin ore rama hota to kabhi sabji main namak kam pad jaataa, kabhi zyada
 kabhi daal ke baghaar main hing daalana bhul jaatin to kabhi baghaar die bina hi daal paros di jaati
 puraa ghar bhakthi ras se sarabor rahata tha
 Therefore, no attention was paid to these small things
 usee satvik vaataavaran main 11 sitambar 1895 ko vinoba kaa janm hua
 His childhood name was Vinayak
 Mother used to call him affectionately as Vinya
 Apart from Vinoba, Rukmini Bai had two more sons: Valkoba and Shivaji
 Valkoba smaller than Vinayak
 Shivaji is the youngest
 The name Vinoba was given by Gandhiji
 maharashtra main naam ke peeche ‘ba’ lagane kaa jo chalan he, uske anusaar
 tucoba, vithoba or vinoba
 Vinayak's mother's nature was also found
 unka man bhi hameshaa aadhyatm chintan main leen rahata
 na unhen khaane-pine kii sud rahati thi
 Neither taste had a special identity
 maa jaisaa paros deteen, chupchaap kha lete
 rukmini bai kaa galaa bada hi madhur tha
 She would drown in listening to the hymn
 When she used to sing, she started to flow in full devotion in the whole environment
 They used to sing sweetly in the chants of Ramayana
 It seems like mother Sharda is lukewarm
 vinoba ko aadhyatm ke sanskaar dene, unhen bhakthi-vedant kii ore le jane main, bachapan main unke man main sanyas or vairaygy kii prerana jagaane main unki maa rukmini bai kaa bada yogadan tha
 The child Vinayak received the rites of both parents
 ganit kii sujh-boojh or tark-samathrya, vigyaan ke prati gahan anuraag, parampara ke prati vaigyanik drushtikon or tamaam tarah ke purvagrahon se alag hatakar sochane kii kala unhen pita kii ore se praapt hui
 While deep affection for religion and culture found by the mother, a sense of welfare of the living beings
 Positive attitude towards life, art of all religion, coexistence and respect
 Later Vinoba was considered as the spiritual heir of Gandhiji
 aaj bhi kuch log yahi kehete hai
 But this is a one-sided and one-sided analysis of Vinoba's character
 ve gandhi ji ke ‘aadhyatmik uttaradhikari’ se bahut aage, swatantra soch ke swami the
 The main thing is that Gandhi's brilliant halo could not be evaluated independently of his personality
 mahatma gandhi raajnneetik jeev the
 His spiritual consciousness was limited to the morning-evening aarti and worship
 jabaki unki dharmik-chetana unke raajnneetik kaaryakramon ke anukool or samanvyatmak thi
 There was no room for criticism and criticism
 dharm-darshan ke maamle main yun to vinoba bhi samarpan or sweekaarya-bhav rakhte the
 But whenever he got the opportunity, he explained the scriptures out of the box
 chaahe vah ‘gita pravachan’ hon yaa sant tukaraam ke abhangon par likhi gai pustak ‘santaprasad’
 isse usamen paryaapt moulikta or sahajata he
 This work could do only that which is free from anyone's intellectual halo
 ek baat yah bhi mahatma gandhi ke sanndhyi main aane se pehle hi vinoba aadhyatmik oonchai praapt kar chuke the
 Even after coming to the ashram, he used to take regular time for study and meditation
 vinoba se pehali hi mulaakaat main prabhavit hone par gandhi ji ne sahaj-man se kaha tha— Philosophy was his favorite subject
 ashram main daakhil hone ke kuch mahinon ke bheetar hi darshanashastra kii aage kii padhai ke liye unhone ek varsh kaa adhyayan avkaash liya tha
 Vinoba had two younger brothers like this, but Vinayak got the most of his mother
 bhaavnaatmak str par vinoba bhi khud ko apane pita kii apeksha maa ke adhik kareeb pate the
 The same situation was with Rukmini Bai, 'vinya' was the closest to his heart among the three sons
 ve bhajan-pujan ko samarpit rahati
 maa ke sanskaron kaa prabhaav
 bhautik sukh-suvidhaon ke prati udaseenta or tyaag kii bhaavana kishoravastha main hi vinoba ke charitra kaa hissaa ban chuki thi
 The homeless corner would have made them more relaxed
 Silence would have made his conscience vocal
 He lived in the house, in the family among all, but such that even while living with everyone as if separate from him, clean and absolute
 Otherwise, to the mother, in her company
 'vinya' was much closer to his heart, his spiritual mind-building
 man ko koi uljhan ho to vahi sulajhane main madad karata
 koi aadhyatmik samasya ho to bhi vinya hi kaam aata
 yahaan tak ki yadi pati narhari bhaave bhi kuch kahen to usamen vinya kaa nirnay hi mahatvapurn hota tha
 It is not that Vinya was completely free or out of control
 parivaar kii aachaar samhita vinoba par bhi puri tarah lagu hoti thi
 Rather an incident of Vinoba's childhood
 rukmini bai ne bacchon ke liye ek niyam banaaya hua tha ki bhojan tulsi ke paughe ko pani dene ke baad hi milegaa
 vinya baahar se khelkar ghar pahunchate, bhukh se aakul-vyakul
 maa ke paas pahunchate hi kehete: Rukmini used to study the book 'das Bodh' of Samarth Guru Ramdas daily before sleeping
 Only then did she go to the bed
 It was only natural for the child to have this effect
 ve use sant gyaneshwar, tukaraam, namdev or shankaracharya kii kathaayen sunaatin
 ramayana, mahabharat kii kahaniyaan, upanishdon ke tatv gyaan ke bare main samajhaatin
 sanyas unki bhaawanaaon par savaar rahata
 lekin duniya se bhaagane ke bajaay logon se judane par ve jor deteen
 sansar se bhaagane ke bajaay usko badalane kaa aagrah karatin
 aksar kahatee—‘vinya, grihasthashram kaa bhalee-bhaanti paalan karne se pitaron ko mukti milti he
 'but on Vinya, the ghost of Guru Ramdas, Saint Dnyaneshwar and Shankaracharya used to ride
 All these Mahatmas boycotted their parents and family at a very young age for their spiritual fulfillment
 ve kehete— If there was another mother, she would have been shaken
 From the point of view, the sky would have lifted up on the head
 Because the general trend of people has become that renunciation, renunciation is a good thing, a matter of greatness, but only when renunciation and recluse are in the other's house
 Everyone wants to live a simple worldly life in their home
 magar rukmini bai to jaise kisi or hi mitti kii bani thim
 She lovingly explains to the son- betaa maa ke kahe ko aatmsaat karne kaa prayaas kar hi rahaa hota ki ve aage jod deteen- Vinoba was very intelligent in childhood
 Mathematics was his favorite subject
 kavita or aadhyatm chetana ke sanskaar maa se mili
 From them, the feeling of seeing both Root and Chetan with equal vision awakened
 Mother was very educated
 par unhone kii vinya ko aparigrah, astey ke bare main apane aacharan se bataaya
 While living in the world, taught him to be detached
 The mother's only effect was that Vinya would compose poetry and would burn them
 When everything in the world is temporary and fleeting, if nothing goes together then why should you be fascinated with your creation
 His mother would see all this, think, but say nothing
 As if she is preparing Vinya for the biggest sacrifice
 Vinoba's mathematical proficiency and his arguments were not hampered by his spiritual belief
 yadi kabhi donon ke bich spardhaa hoti bhi to jeet aadhyatmik vishwaas kii hi hoti
 aaj ve ghatnaayen maa-bete ke aapasi sneh-anuraag or vishwaas kaa aitihaasik dastavej hai
 Rukmini Bai used to donate one lakh grains of rice every month
 ek lakh kii ginati karnaa bhi aasaan na tha, so ve puure maheene ek-ek chaaval ginati rahati
 narhari bhaave patni ko chaaval ginate main shram karte dekh muskaraate
 kam umr main hi aankh kamjor pad jane se dar sataane lagata
 unki ganit buddhi kuch or hi kahati
 so ek din unhone rukmini bai ko tok hi diya—‘is tarah ek-ek chaaval ginaney main samay jaaya karne kii jarurat hi kya he
 Take a loaf of rice
 Count them Then take out the weight of one lakh rice from it and weigh it
 If there is no shortage, then put a few fists from above
 It was argued
 loukik samajhadaari bhi isi main thi ki jab bhi sambhav ho, duusare jaruri kaaryon ke liye samay kii bachat kii jaae
 rukmini bai ko pati kaa tark samaj to aata
 par man na maanata
 ek din unhone apni duvidha vinya ke saamne prakat karne ke baad poocha— The son heard everything, thought
 bolaa, ‘maa, pita ji ke tark main dam he
 This is what mathematics says
 kintu daan ke liye chaaval ginana sirf ginati karnaa nahin he
 While counting, we not only take the name of God with every rice, but our mind is also attached to it
 ’ ishwar ke naam par daan ke liye chaaval ginana bhi ek sadhana he, rukmini bai ne aisa pehle kahaan sochaa tha
 Rukmini Bai, who is fully immersed in Adhyatmarasas, liked the things of 'vinya'
 He used to be proud of his son
 He did not stop counting the rice even further
 Nor did his mind ever awaken to futility
 aisi hi ek or ghatana he
 Which shows how Vinoba Corey discovered metaphysics in mathematical calculations
 ghatana us samay kii he jab ve gandhi ji ke ashram main pravesh kar chuke the tathaa unke rachanaatmak kaaryon main bad-chadhakar hissaa le rahe the
 Prayer meetings take place in the ashram in the morning and evening
 The ashram dwellers who attend them are regularly counted
 This responsibility was a worker
 prasang yah he ki ek din prarthana sabha ke baad jab us kaaryakarta ne prarthana main upasthit hue aagantukon kii sankhya bataai to vinoba jhat se pratwaad karte hue bole— The worker believed in his count, so he too stood firm
 karm man vishwaas rakhane vaale vinoba aamtaur par bahes main padane se bachate the
 But on that day too, they were adamant
 ashram main vivaadon kaa niptaan baapu kii adaalat main hota tha
 Gandhiji believed in his worker
 magar jaanate the ki vinoba yun hi bahes main nahin padane vaale
 vaastaviktaa jaanane ke liye unhone vinoba kii ore dekha
 tab vinoba ne kaha—‘prarthana main sammilit shraddhaluon kii sankhya jitani inhone bataai usase ek kam hi thi
 ' 'how?' 'because a man's full attention was focused on counting the gentlemen present there
 ’ gandhiji vinoba kaa tark samaj gaye
 What is the need of accounts and appearances in the work of prayer
 Further, the work of counting the people who came to the prayer meeting was stopped
 yuvavastha ke praarambhik daur main hi vinoba aajanm brahmacharee rahane kii thaan chuke the
 The same great men were his ideals who had asceticism in childhood to seek truth
 or jab sanyas dhaaran kar brahmacharee bananaa he, grihasth jivan se naata hi todna he to kyon na man ko usee ke anuroop taiyaar kiya jaae
 kyon ulajhaa jaae sambandhon kii mithi door, sansaarik pralobhanon main
 brahmacharya kii to pehali shart yahi he ki man ko bhatakane se roka jaae
 vaasanaon par niyantran rahe
 Someone had told Kishore Vinayak that Brahmachari should not attend any wedding feast
 ve aise kaaryakramon main jane se aksar bachate bhi the
 Father Narhari Bhave was there, if anyone else had known, the younger brother would have gone
 Vinoba's body was weak
 bachapan se hi koi na koi vyaadhi lagi rahati
 magar man-mastishk puri tarah chaitanya
 maano sharir kii sari shaktiyaan simatakar dimag main samaa gai haa
 smriti vilakshan thi
 Kishore Vinayak had well memorized hundreds of verses of saints Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Namdev along with the Vedas, Upanishads
 gita unhen bachapan se hi kanthsth thi
 Later on, forty thousand verses were also well rumored in his mind
 vinayak kii badi bahan kaa vivaah tay hua to maano pariksha kii ghadi bhi kareeb aa gai
 He decided that he would stay away from the feast on the occasion of marriage
 No one should interrupt, so they announced to keep fast that day
 bahan ke vivaah main bhai upwas rakhe, yah bhi uchit na tha
 Father got angry on hearing this
 magar maa ne baat sambhaal lee
 He persuaded the son to eat simple 'dal-bhat'
 yahi nahin apane haathon se alag pakaakar bhi diya
 Married to grandeur
 vinayak ne khushi-khushi usamen hissaa liya
 But i had to live only for my mother with specially made pulses
 maa-bete kaa yah prem aage bhi bana rahaa
 Later, when he left home to retire, he carried a red-edged dhoti of mother and a statue from their worship house
 murti to unhone duusare ko bhent kar di thi
 But the mother's dhoti would carry with her wherever she went
 While sleeping, keeping the headrest
 Like walking around with mother's blessings
 Even the ascetic could not escape the memory of his mother
 maa ke sanskaar hi vinoba kii aadhyatmik chetana kii neenv bane
 His biography developed on him
 aage chalakar unhone rachanaatmakataa or aadhyatm ke kshetra main jo khyaati arjeet kii uske mul main bhi maa kii hi preranaayen thim
 Rukmini Bai was less educated
 sanskrit samaj nahin aati thim
 But the mind was that there was a longing for Gita and knowledge
 One day the mother put her difficulty before the son- vinoba dharmik sanskaron main paakhand ke virdohi the
 At the time of his mother's death, Vinoba had differences with his father and brothers
 vinoba brahmanon ke haath se paramparaagat tareeke se dah-sanskaar kaa virodh kar rahe the
 But in front of the family's insistence, they did not do one
 Vinoba too stood firm on his principles
 nateeja yah ki jis maa ko ve sabase adhik chaahate the, jo unki aadhyatmik guru thim, unke antim sanskaar se ve dur hi rahe
 He bid farewell to the mother with silent eyes
 aage chalakar 29 oktober 1947 ko vinoba ke pita kaa nidhan hua to unhone vedon ke nirdesh ki ‘mitti par mitti kaa hi adhikaar he’ kaa paalan karte hue unki deh ko agni-samarpit karne ke bajaay, mitti main dabaane jor diya
 By then Vinoba saints had become Vinoba
 gandhi ji kaa unhen aashirwad tha
 So this time they did it
 maa kii gita main aasthaa thi
 She was entrusted with the task of translating Geeta into Marathi to Vinoba
 vinoba us kaary main manoyog se lage the
 Finally the translation work is complete
 pustak kaa naam rakhaa gaya- gitai
 gita+ai = gitai
 maharashtra main ‘ai’ kaa abhipraay ‘maa ke prati’ se he; yani maa kii smriti uske neh se judi-rachi gita
 putr kii kriti ko dekhne ke liye to rukmini bai jivit nahin thim
 But Geetai, associated with his memory and desire, started getting mired in the grief of mothers and sisters from house to house in Maharashtra
 unki aadhyatm chetana kaa aabhushan ban gai
 When Gandhiji listened, he praised the translation work
 jo mahilaayein sanskrit nahin jaanati thim, jinhen apni bhashaa kaa bhi aadha-adhuraa gyaan tha, unke liye sahaj-saral bhashaa main rachi gai ‘gitai’, gita kii aadhyatmikta main doobane ke liye vardaan ban gai
 Vinoba's rites received from his mother in his childhood continued to get thicker in his youth
 yuvavastha kii ore badhate hue vinoba na to sant gyaneshwar ko bhula paae the, na tukaraam ko
 That was his ideal
 sant tukaraam ke abhang to ve bade hi manoyog se gaate
 unka apane aradhy se ladanaa-jhagadna, naaraaz hokar gaali dena, ruuthana-manaanaa unhen bahut acha lagata
 sant ramdaas kaa jivan bhi unhen prerana detaa
 ve na shankaracharya ko vismrit kar paae the, na unke sanyas ko
 Darshan was his favorite subject
 himalay jab se hosh sambhala tha, tabhi se unki sapanom main aata tha or ve kalpana main swayan ko satya kii khoj main gahan kandaraon main tap-sadhana karte hue pate
 vahaan kii nirjan, varf se dhaki deergh-gahan kandaraon main unhen paramasatya kii khoj main leen ho jane ke liye uksaatin
 In 1915 he passed the High School examination
 ab aage kya padhaa jaae
 vaigyanik pravriti ke pita or aadhyatm main dubi rahane vaali maa kaa vaicharik dwandv vahaan bhi alag-alag dhaaraon main prakat hua
 Father said - 'read French
' Mother said - 'brahmin's son should not read Sanskrit, how is it possible!' Vinoba kept the mind of both of them
 inter main french ko chunaa
 He continued to study Sanskrit at a personal level
 un dinon french gyaan-vigyaan ke kshetra main ho rahi kranti kii bhashaa thi
 All the transformative literature was being created in it
 duusari ore baroda kaa pustkaalay durlabh pustakon, pandulipiyon ke khajaane ke liye puure desh main prasiddh tha
 Vinoba made that library his second destination
 vidhyalay se jaise hi chuttee milti, ve pustkaalay main jaakar adhyayan main dub jate
 francisi sahitya ne vinoba kaa parichay pashchimi deshon main ho rahi vaicharik kranti se karaayaa
 sanskrit ke gyaan ne unhen vedon or upanishdon main gaharaai se paithne kii yogyata di
 If the level of knowledge increased, then his ardor also increased
 But the attraction of the Himalayas from the mind, the practice of renunciation, did not go away
 un dinon inter kii pariksha ke liye mumbai janaa padataa tha
 Vinoba also boarded a train going to Mumbai on 25 March 1916 as per schedule
 At that time, his mind was turbulent
 puraa vishwaas tha ki hiskool kii tarah inter kii pariksha bhi paas kar hi lenge
 magar uske baad kya? kya yahi unke jivan kaa lakshya he? vinoba ko lag rahaa tha ki apane jivan main ve jo chaahate hai, vah aupchaarik adhyayan dwaara sambhav nahin
 The certificates of the school and the degrees of the college are not his intention
 railgadee apni gati se bhaag rahi thi
 Vinoba's mind was running faster than him
 After all, victory was of the mind
 jaise hi gaadi surat pahunchi, vinoba usase neeche utar aae
 The car moved forward but Vinoba's mind went on pulling to the other side
 duusare platform par purv kii ore jane vaali railgadee maujuud thi
 Vinoba felt that the Himalayas were once again inviting him
 grihasth jivan yaa sanyas
 man main kuch der tak sangharsh chalaa
 uhapoh se guzarate hue unhone unhone nirnay liya or usee gaadi main savaar ho gaye
 The Saints set out on their favorite journey
 Unaware of the fact that this time also the journey for which they have set out, is not their real journey, but only a halt
 jivan se palaayan unki niyati nahin
 He has to emerge as a hope for the lives of millions and millions of Indians
 brahm kii khoj, satya kii khoj, sanyas lene kii saadh main vinoba bhatak rahe the
 He left home with the same goal
 himalay kii ore yatra jari thi
 Kashi came to a halt in the middle
 mithkon ke anusaar bhagwaan shankar kii nagari
 hajaaron varshon tak dharm-darshan kaa centre rahi kaashi
 sadhu-santon or vichaarkon kaa kumbh
 jigyaasuon or gyaan-pipaasuon ko apni ore aakarshith karne vaali pavitra dharmasthali
 shankaracharya tak khud ko kaashi-yatra ke pralobhan se nahin roak paae the
 At the Ganga Ghat in Kashi, where new ideas flourish, Vittanda was also composed countless times
 usee ganga tat par vinoba bhatak rahe the
 Looking for a destination for yourself
 In search of a Guru who can show them the way forward
 jis lakshya ke liye unhone ghar choda tha, us lakshya tak pahunchane kaa maarg bataa sake
 While wandering, they reached a place where some truth-seekers were discussing
 vishay tha advait or dwait main koun sahi
 prashn kaaphi purana tha
 About twelve hundred years ago, there was a decisive debate on this
 shankaracharya or mandan mishra ke bich
 us aitihaasik bahes main dwaitvaadi mandan mishra or unki patni ko shankaracharya ne parajeet kiya tha
 The same subject was again caught between those truth-seekers
 yaa kaho ki vakt kaatane ke liye donon paksh apane-apane tarkon ke saath vitanda rach rahe the
 And then, leading the debate to a conclusion, it was suddenly announced that the monotheist had won
 vinoba chanke
 unki hansi chhot gai— On the one hand Vinoba was wandering on the ghats, in the streets of Kashi, seeking solace, in the practice of renunciation
 vahiin duusari ore ek or jigyaasu bharat ko jaanane, uske hridaypradesh kii dhadakanon ko pahchaanane, usase atmiyata bharaa rishta kaayam karne ke liye bharat-bhraman par niklaa hua hua tha
 He returned from South Africa a few months ago after gaining immense fame
 aage uski yojana bhartiya raajnneeti main dakhal dene kii thi
 The name of that seeker was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
 At the behest of his political mentor, Govind Ballabh Pant, he set out on a year-long tour of India for the purpose of knowing the soul of India
 aage chalakar bhartiya raajnneeti par chaa jane, karodon bharatiyon ke dil kii dhadkan, bhartiya swadhinata andolan kaa pramukh sutaradhar, ahimsak senaanee ban jane vaale gandhi un dinon aprasiddh hi the
 The title of 'mahatma' was also far from them
 sirf dakshin africa main chhede gaye andolan kii puunji hi unke saath thi
 Because of that he was known all over India
 un dinon unka padaav bhi kaashi hi tha
 As if time was making its magic game to introduce two great souls
 kaashi main mahaamanaa madan mohan malviya dwaara sthapit hindu vishvavidhyalay main ek bada jalsa ho rahaa tha
 On February 4, 1916, raje-maharaja, Nabav, Samant were all present in the procession
 sammelan kii chata dekhte hi banati thi
 Gandhi gave a historic speech at that conference
 vah kaha jisaki us samay koi ummid nahin kar saktaa tha
 In time, Gandhi ji openly criticized the kings and feudal lords who were well-off by the British themselves, whose donations were run by Kashi University and other institutions
 
 usko garibon ke kalyaan main lagaaein
 unhone awahn kiya ki ve vyapak lokhit main apane saare aabhushan daan kar den
 She had a revolutionary appeal
 sabha main khalabali much gai
 But Gandhi's smile remained the same
 agle din us sammelan kii khabaron se akhbaar range pade the
 Vinoba learned about Gandhiji only through the newspaper
 And they felt that the goal they had left home in search of was fulfilled
 vinoba kori shanti kii talash main hi ghar se nahin nikle the
 Neither were they unfamiliar with the situation in the country and the inhuman atrocities being committed by the British
 magar koi raah mil hi nahin rahi thi
 After reading the speech, he felt that this person has peace as well as revolution
 He wrote a letter to Gandhiji from there
 Answer came
 gandhi ji ke aamantran ke saath
 vinoba to uski pratiksha kar hi rahe the
 He immediately left for the Cochrab Ashram in Ahmedabad, where Gandhiji had his ashram
 7 june 1916 ko vinoba kii gandhi se pehali bhent hui
 After that Vinoba remained as Gandhiji
 gandhi ji ne bhi vinoba kii pratibha ko pahchaan liya tha
 So his comment after the first meeting was that most people come from here to take something, this is the first person who came to give something
 ’ kaaphi din baad apni pehali bhent ko yaad karte hue vinoba ne kaha tha— The meeting between Gandhi and Vinoba was revolutionary
 gandhi ji ko jaise hi pataa chalaa ki vinoba apane mata-pita ko bina bataae aae hai, unhone vahiin se vinoba ke pita ke naam ek patr likhaa ki vinoba unke saath surakshit hai
 After that their relationship continued to deepen
 vinoba ne khud ko gandhi ji ke ashram ke liye samarpit kar diya
 From studies, teaching, spinning, farming work to community life, he was ahead in every activity of the ashram
 Gandhiji's statement that this young man has come to take nothing from the ashram residents but to give it was becoming true
 umr se ekadam yuva vinoba unhen anushaasan or kartavyaparayanata kaa paath to padhaa hi rahe the
 Gandhiji's influence was growing rapidly
 utani hi teji se bad rahi ashram main aane vaale kaaryakartaaon kii sankhya
 kocharab ashram chota padane laga to ahmedabad main sabarmati ke kinare nae ashram kaa kaam teji se hone laga
 lekin aazaadee ke ahimsak sainik taiyaar karne kaa kaam akele sabarmati ashram se bhi sambhav bhi na tha
 Gandhi also wanted the same ashram in Wardha
 vahaan par aise anushaasit kaaryakarta kii aavashyaktaa thi, jo ashram ko gandhi ji ke aadarshon ke anuroop chalaa sake
 iske liye vinoba sarvatha anukool paatr the or gandhi ji ke vishwasaneey bhi
 8 april 1923 ko vinoba wardha ke liye prasthaan kar gaye
 There he started editing the 'maharashtra Dharma' monthly
 marathi main prakashit hone vaali is patrika main vinoba ne niyamit rup se upanishdon or maharashtra ke santon par likhnaa aarambh kar diya, jinke kaaran desh main bhakthi andolan kii shuruyaat hui thi
 The magazine gained unexpected popularity, shortly after that it had to be weekly, Vinoba was still known as Gandhiji's disciple and satyagrahi
 patrika ke madhyam se janata unki aadhyatmik paith ko jaanane lagi thi
 At the time of World War II, the United Kingdom was being forced into a war by the United Kingdom against which a personal satyagraha was started on 17 October 1940 and Vinoba was made the first Satyagrahi by Gandhiji
 apana satyagrah shuru karne se pehle apane vichaar spasht karte hue vinoba ne ek vaktavy jari kiya tha
 It said that aage unhone itnaa or kaha - In his speeches Vinoba used to tell the people that through negative programs neither peace can be established nor war can be ended
 yuddh rugn maansikta kaa nateeja he or iske liye rachanaatmak kaaryakramon kii jarurat hoti he
 Not only the people of Europe, but the entire human race should take the responsibility
 sitambar,1951 main ke
pi
mashruvala kii pustak gandhi or marks prakashit hui or vinoba ne isaki bhoomika likhi
 In this, Vinoba showed great respect for Marx
 karl marks ko unhone vichaarak mana tha
 a thinker who had genuine sympathy for the poor
 vaise to marks ki soch main vinoba ko khot dikhi thi or lakshya par pahunchane ke tareeke ko lekar marks se unhone apana matbhed vyakt kiya
 Vinoba believed that communists arose because of the rich people
 vinoba kaa viswas tha ki har baat main barabari kaa siddhant lagu hona chahie
 He had said: Police action cannot be helpful to end the terror of communists
 isko jad se samaapt kiya jaae
 No matter how confused they may be, Vinoba did not consider the Communists to be destroyers and by arguing with them and expressing active sympathy for their aims, Vinoba wanted to get them on the right path
 bisiyon bhashaaon ke gyaata vinoba ji devanagari ko vishwa lipi ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate the
 For India, he favored developing Devanagari as a contact script
 ve kehete the ki main nahin kahata ki nagari hi chale, balki main chahta hum ki nagari bhi chale
 Inspired by his ideas, Nagari script Sangam has been established which works to use and spread Devanagari within India and outside India
 vistrut jaankaree ke liye nagari evam bhartiya bhashaayen padhen
 Vinobaji was always a social and creative activist
 swatantrata ke purv gandhiji ke rachaanatmak kaaryon main sakriy rup se yogadan dete rahe
 His health started deteriorating due to work, he was advised by a doctor to go to a hill station
 at: 1937 i0 main vinoba bhaave pawanaar ashram main gayi
 Since then, this has been the central place to start his creative work throughout his life
 rachaanatmak kaaryon ke atiritk ve mahaan swatantraaa senaanee bhi the
 He was imprisoned in the Nagpur Flag Satyagraha
 1937 main gandhiji jab landan kii golmes conference se khaali haath lote to jalgaanv main vinoba bhaave ne ek sabha main angrejon kii aalochana kii to unhen bandi banaakar chah maah kii sajaa di gayi
 After being freed from prison, Gandhiji made him the first Satyagrahi
 17 oktober 1940 ko vinoba bhavaji ne satyagrah kiya or ve bandi banaaye gayi tathaa unhen 3 varsh ke liye sashram karawas kaa dand mila
 Gandhiji consulted Vinobaji in 1942 before leaving India

 kehete hai, shasta kaa janm mohini veshadhari vishnu or shiv ke samagam se hua tha
 The famous temple of Ayyappan is located in this Dham, situated among 18 hills, known as Punakavan, which is called Sabarimala Sridharmashastha Temple
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki parashuram ne ayppan puja ke liye sabarimala main murti sthapit kii thi
 Some people also associate it with the name of Rambhakta Shabari
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki kareeb 700-800 saal pehle dakshin main shaiva or vaishnavon ke bich vaimnasy kaaphi bad gaya tha
 Mr
 Ayyappan was then envisaged to address those differences
 donon ke samanvay ke liye is dharmatirth ko viksit kiya gaya
 Even today, this temple is considered a symbol of harmony and harmony

 The rest, a wonderful example of secularism, is seen at a place called Erumeli, just a few miles from here, as the mausoleum of the Muslim Dharmanuayi Vavar, considered an ally of Mr
 Ayyappan, where the visit here would not have been complete without waiting for a visit

 Sri Lankan women's cricket team visits India scuba diving pani ke neeche diving kii ek vidha he jisamen scuba gotaakhor ek self kontaned underwater breathing apparatas kaa prayog karata hai
 Which are completely independent of the surface supply for breathing under water
 scuba divers jo sashastr balon ke saath gupt oparation main lage rahete hai unhen frog main, ladaaku gotakhoron yaa hamale karne vaale tairaakon ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 By the mid-twentieth century, there were two basic methods for scuba: open circuit scuba and closed circuit scuba
 sar robert davis, siebe gorman ke pramukh ne, 1910 main oxigen ri brether main sudhaar kiya
 Scuba diving is done for a variety of reasons, both personal and professional
 manoranjan ke scuba diving vishuddh rup se anand ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Divers can be employed in a professional manner to perform underwater tasks
 scuba diving ke liye gaharaai kii seemaa swa samaayojan evam prashikshan par nirbhar karata he, lekin manoranjan ke liye jo gote lagaaye jate hai ve 30 meter gahare yaa usase kam hote hai
 In diving for manning, divers use half-mouth masks that cover their noses and mouths
 peshewar scuba gotakhoron puure chehre vaale mask kaa upyog karte he
 a mixture of gases is used for some diving which is in addition to normal atmospheric air as long as divers are able to use it
 surakshit rup se ghota lagane ke liye, gotakhoron ko apane pani main utarane evam chadane kii dar ko niyantrit karnaa aavashyak hai iske liye ye bhi jaruri hai kii ve bich pani main ek samaan gaharaai banaaye rakhe
 When divers want to stay in constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy
 hawa kii tulana main pani kaa apvartanaank zyada hota he jo kaaphi had tak aankh kii cornea ke samaan hota hai
 Those with severe myopia can see better underwater than normal people without a mask
 gotakhori ke mask evam helmet gotaakhor ko pani main suraksha pradaan karte hai
 Energy losses in cold water are usually protected by wet suits or dry suits
 iske alaava ye kuch samudri jeevon ke dank se, dhup se twachaa ke jalane se bachane ko evam gharshan se hone vaale chot se suraksha pradaan karte hai
 Where thermal insulation is not important, Lycra suit / diving skin may suffice
 wet suut ek paridhaan he jo aamtaurjhaag banaaye hue niopreen se bana hota hai evam thermal insulation, gharshan pratirodh or oochaal pradaan karata he
 The dried suit provides thermal insulation to the diver landing, and usually protects the entire body except the head, hands and sometimes legs
 adhik jaankaree: suraksha upkaran § diving kaa saamaan The underwater environment is unfamiliar and dangerous, so all, simple and necessary procedures must be followed to ensure the safety of the diver

 This condition is called resonance
 jis aavriti par sabase adhik aayam vaale dolan kii pravriti paayi jaati he, us aavriti ko anunaad aavriti kehete hai
 Resonance phenomena are associated with all types of vibrations or waves
 arthath yantric, dhwani, vidyutchumbakeey athwa kwantum tarang falnon ke saath anunaad ho sakati he
 Even a recurring force of a small amplitude, which is of resonance frequency or approximately equal frequency, can cause oscillations of very high amplitude in that system
 anunaadi tantron ke bahut se upyog hai
 They can be used to generate vibrations at any desired frequency; Or it can be done to sort out any chosen frequency from a complex vibration
 1) ek vastu yaa tantra - jisaki koi prakritik aavriti ho;2) vaahak yaa kaarak bal - jisaki aavriti, tantra kii prakritik aavriti ke samaan ho; 3) is tantra main urja nasht karne vaala avyav kam se kam ho 
 , Viscosity etc
 are responsible for energy loss in any system
 ) In sound-related applications, the resonant frequency of an object is equal to the natural frequency of that object
 yah mahatvapurn he ki kisi vastu kii prakritik aavriti us vastu ke bhautik avyavon ke maan se nirdhaarit hoti he
 This fact of determining natural frequency from physical components applies in all areas of physics
 anunaadi aavriti ke kuch nihitarth is prakaar he: 1) It is easy to vibrate an object at its natural frequency; It is very difficult to vibrate at other frequencies
 2) koi kampan karti hui vastu, usko compit karaane ke liye lagaaye gayi samishra bal main se keval us aavriti ko chun leti he jo uski prakritik aavriti ke baraabar hoti he or usee aavriti par compit hoti he
 Almost negates other incarnations
 is prakaar yah ek filter kaa kaary karti he
 3) Most vibrating objects have more than one resonant frequency
 jhula:yadi jhule ko dhakka dete samay is baat kaa dhyaan rakhen ki dhakka usee interval par den jo jhule kaa prakritik aavartkaal he, to us jhule kaa aayam bayaa hi chalaa jaataa he
