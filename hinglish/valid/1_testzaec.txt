 Often they are recited at the beginning and end of the Hindu religious acts
 Shanti Mantras are found in Upanishads, where they are invoked in the beginning of some topics of Upanishads
 They are supposed to calm the mind of reciter and environment around him / her
 Reciting them is also believed to be removing any obstacles for the task being started
 Shanti Mantras always end with three utterances of word "shanti" which means "peace"
 The Reason for uttering three times is for calming and removing obstacles inthree realms which are: "physical" or adhibhautik, "divine" or subordinate and "internal" or aadhyatmik According to the scriptures of Hinduism sources of obstacles and troubles are in these three realms
 Physical or adhi-bhautika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming from external world, such as from wild animals, people, natural calamities etc
 Divine or adhi-daivika realm can be source of troubles / obstacles coming from extra-sensory world of spirits, ghosts, deities, demigods / angels etc
 Internal or Adhyaatmika realm is source of troubles / obstacles arising out of ones own body and mind, such as pain, diseases, laziness, absent-mindedness etc
 These are called "tapa-traya" or three classes of troubles
 When Shanti mantras are recited, obstacles from these realms are believed to bepacified

 gaay, bail, bhens, bakrii, ghoda aadi paaltu pashuon ko khilaaye jane yogya sabhi chijen chaara yaa 'pashuchara' yaa 'pashu aahaar' kehalaatin hai
 The food which is fed to the animal in 24 hours, which contains food to meet its requirements, is called animal food
 jis aahaar main pashu ke sabhi aavashyak poshak tatv uchit anupaat tathaa maatra main upalavdh hon, use santulit aahaar kehete hai
 Scientifically, according to the body weight of milch animals, various elements of food such as protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, vitamins and water are required for its requirements such as sustenance, growth, and production
 pashuon main aahaar kii maatra uski utpaadakta tathaa prajnan kii avasthaa par nirbhar karti he
 The animal should get 2 / 3 part of the total diet with thick fodder and 1 / 3 part by mixing the grain
 mote chaare main dalhani tathaa gaiyr dalhani chaare kaa mishran diya ja saktaa he
 Increasing the amount of pulp feed in the diet can reduce the quantity of grains

 According to this, we can broadly divide the diet of adult milch animals into three classes
 yah aahaar kii vah maatra he jise pashu ko apane sharir ko swasth rakhane ke liye diya jaataa he
 It is used by the animal to maintain its body temperature in the proper range, for the necessary activities of the body such as digestion, transport, respiration, excretion, metabolism etc
 isse uske sharir kaa bajan bhi ek seemaa main sthir bana rahata he
 Whether the animal is in production or not, this diet has to be given to it, in the absence of it, the animal starts becoming weak, which affects its productivity and fertility
 is main desi gaay ke liye tuudi athwa sookhe ghaas kii maatra 4 kilo tathaa sankar gaay, shuddh nasl kii deshi gaay athwa bhens ke liye yah maatra 4 se 6 kilo tak hoti he
 Along with this, a mixture of grains is also given to the animal, the quantity of which is kept from 1 to 1
25 kg for the local native cow and 2
0 kg for the hybrid cow, pure breed indigenous cow or buffalo
 is vidhi dwaara pashu ko khilaane ke liye dane kaa mishran uchit avyavon ko thik anupaat main milakar bana hona aavashyak he
 For this, the herders themselves can make satisfactory animal grains by mixing the following components in the given proportions
 utpaadan aahaar pashu aahaar kii vah maatra he jise ki pashu ko jivan nirvaah ke liye die jane vaale aahaar ke atiri uske doodh utpaadan ke liye diya jaataa he
 In this, one kg of grain should be given in addition to the subsistence diet for production of 2
5 kg of milk for local cows whereas for hybrid / native milch cows / buffaloes this quantity is given for 2 kg of milk
 yadi haraa chaara paryaapt maatra main uplabdh he to har 10 kilo achche kism ke hare chaare ko dekar 1 kilo dana kam kiya ja saktaa he
 This will reduce the cost of animal feed and production will also be fine
 pashu ko dugdh utpaadan tathaa jivan nirvaah ke liye saaf pani din main kam se kam teen baar jarur pilaanaa chahie
 In the pregnancy of the animal, it is given an extra diet from the 5th month because after this period the growth of the unborn baby starts very fast
 atah garbh main pal rahe bachche kii uchit vruddhi va vikaas ke liye tathaa gaay / bhens ke agle byaant main sahi dugdh utpaadan ke liye is aahaar kaa dena nitant aavashyak he
 It should be given 1
25 kg for local cows and 1
75 kg for hybrid cows and buffaloes
 adhik doodh dene vaale pashuon ko garbhavastha ke 8wein maah se athwa byaane ke 6 saptaah pehle unki dugdh granthiyon ke purna vikaas ke liye pashu kii icchaanusaar dane kii maatra badha dena chahie
 For this, the quantity of 3 kg in the animals of Jebu breed and 4-5 kg of grain in hybrid cows and buffaloes should be given in addition to the subsistence requirement of the animal
 isse pashu agle byaant main apni kshamta ke anusaar adhiktam dugdhotpaadan kar sakate hai
 Four of Yama's natural satellites are known to scientists: Sharon, discovered in 1978, two small moons, Nix and Hydra, discovered in 2005, and announced on 20 July 2011, Ace / 2011 P1

 This theory evolved from the concept of continental displacement, envisaged in the first decade of the twentieth century, when new evidence was discovered in the 1960s that strengthened the concept of continents being dynamic rather than static

 The discovery of Sagar Nittal Varshan by Harry Hayes is believed to be the beginning of the rendering of this theory and scholars like Wilson, Morgan, mckenzie, Oliver, Parker etc
 contributed to its promotion by providing evidence in its favor

 These plates are floating on the semicircular layer of the asthenosphere at the bottom and are generally moving at a speed of about 10–40 mm / yr, although some have a velocity of 160 mm / yr

 In plate tectonics, the word tectonics is derived from the Greek language τεκτονικός meaning to relate to construction

 Wagner was the first to use the term "continental displacement", following the same principle of Wagner that the development of plate tectonics was possible, although his ideas were also rejected by scholars for nearly half a century until evidence was available in the 1960s
 
 or mahadwipiya visthaapan Due to the mobility of the plates, there are three types of edges or borders: is prakaar ke kinaaron ke sahare do platen ek duusare kii ore gati karti hai or takaraakar unamem se baari plate halaki plate ke neeche kshepit hoti he
 This part, which is twisted downward, goes deep and melts and converts into magma due to the excess of heat and pressure
 jis gaharaai par yah ghatana hoti he use kshepan mandal yaa beniof zone kehete hai
 With the help of such edges, due to pressure of the landowners, they turn and form mountains
 neeche jaakar pighla padaarth megma plum ke rup main upar uth kar jwalamukhiyata bhi utpann karata he
 Where two plates move opposite to each other, that is, they move away from each other, magma rises up from the bottom to form a new plate

 suprasiddh darshanik george vilhem fredrick hegel kai varsh tak berlin vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak rahe or unka dehavsaan bhi usee nagar main hua
 There are eight books written by him, including Encyclopedia of Prapanchastra, Theory of Justice and Philosophical Principles, these three texts are particularly notable
 hegel ke darshanik vichaar german-desh ke hi kaant, phicte or shaling naamak darshanikon ke vichaaron se vishesh rup se prabhavit kahe ja sakate hai, haalaanki hegel ke or unke vichaaron main mahatvapurn antar bhi he
 Hegel's philosophy is called Absolute Suffixism or Chidism or Objectual Consciousness; Because in his opinion, soul-soul, seer-view, and nature-male are all different manifestations of the ultimate element or essence in the same absolute knowledge
 unke anusaar vishwa na to achetan prakruti yaa pudgalon kaa parinaam he or na kisi parichhinn vyakti ke man kaa hi khel
 root-conscious-quality-defect-maya is the same infinite, infinite and infinite conscious element in the whole world, which we can call Parbrahma
 usase pruthak kisi bhi padaarth kii satta nahin
 That absolute bird or parabrahma, by its own natural action, manifests itself in the form of various objects or natural phenomena
 use apane se pruthak kisi anya saadhan yaa saamagree kii aavashyaktaa nahin
 According to Hegel, the primordial world and our bodies, even when they are mutually distinct, are intimately related to and inseparable from each other, being manifestations of the same absolute active parabrahma
 hegel ke vichaar main sansar kaa sara hi viksaatmak kriyalap sakriy brahm kaa hi kriyalap he
 What is the root, the conscious, all matter and living being are limited or distinct forms of the same absolute squid
 jadibhoot prakruti, pranayukt vanaspatijagat, chetan pashupakshi tathaa swachetan manushyon ke rup main vahi ek parabrahm apane aapako kramash: abhivyakt karata hai or uski abtak kii abhivyaktiyon main aatmsanvittiyukt maanav hi sarvocch abhivyakti he, jiske darshanik, dharmik tathaa kalatmak uttarottar utkarsh ke dwaara brahm ke hi nijee prayojan kii purti hoti he
 In other words, Brahma develops itself by manifesting itself as the diverse substances of the world
 is prakaar, hegel kaa nirpeksh brahm ek sakriy moort saarvbhaum yaa gatyaatmak evam thos saarvbhaut tatv he, amoort saarvbhaum nahin
 He is neither calm or pseudostatic nor discriminative like the Brahma of Shankaracharya
 hegel ne shaling ke bhedashunya brahm ko ek aisi andhkarpurn raatri ke samaan bataakar, jisamen vividh rangon kii sabhi gauen kaali dikhaai padati hai, sabhi bhedashunya brahmavaadiyon kii katakshapurn aalochana kii he
 Even after accepting the invention of the whole world, Chailing, the characharaka was considered devoid of all kinds of distinctions and beyond nature
 parantu bhedashunya agatyatmak, tatv se bhedpurn tata gatyaatmak sristi ke udai yaa vikaas ko sweekaar karnaa hegel ko yuktiyukt nahin prathit hua
 He did not consider Brahm to be transcendent
 hegel kaa brahm kisi had tak shriramanujacharya ke ishwar se miltaa julata he
 They, like Sriramanujacharya, do not accept the homogeneous exogamous distinction of Brahm, but accept self-discrimination in it
 unhone use bhedatmak abhed yaa anektaagat ekta ke rup main sweekaar kiya he, shuddh abhed yaa kori ekta ke rup main nahin
 Similarly, the principle of Sriramanujacharya is also specific, not Shuddhavaita or Advaita
 hegel chhandogopanishad ke "sarv khalvidan brahm", rugveda ke "purush avedan sarvam" tathaa shrimadbhagavadgita ke "sarvat: parinpavan" aadi siddhant ke anumodak to avashyamev kahe ja sakate hai
 But not the followers of Mandukyopanishad's "amatashturtho% Viable: Prapanchopashma 


" principle
 hegel ne kriyaatmak evam gatisheel vishwa ke vibhinn roopon main honevaali brahm kii atmabhivyakti ko ek vishesh yauktik yaa bauddhik niyam ke anusaar ghatit honevaali mana he
 He said that truth is rational and rational is truth
 duusare shabd main, unke anusaar bauddhik vichaar kaa niyam or sansar ke vikaas kaa niyam ek hi he or unhone yah niyam virodh yaa virodh kaa niyam batalaaya he
 According to this, there is only internal opposition or distraction of that element for the development of the Absolute Brahman, both in the form of inertial world and individual mind
 hegel ke anusaar do virdohi yaa paraspar vyaghaatak vichaaron yaa padaarthon kaa samanvay ek tisare vichaar yaa padaarth main hua karata he
 For example, the idea of "sat" first arises in our mind, or rather the state of all things in the world is "sat"
 parantu "keval sat" yaa "sanmaatr" vastut: asat sadrush he
 Therefore lies or lack of truth is embedded in the site of truth
 or sat asat kii yah vipratipatti hi sat ke bhavi vikaas kaa mul hetu ban jaati he
 Since opposition or opposition is not tolerant of rational thought, it leads to its removal by nature itself and executes the coordination of opposing suffixes named satt and asat in a suffix called "bhava"
 hegel praarambhik pratyay ko paksh yaa nighaan, uske virdohi pratyay ko pratipaksh yaa pratidhaan tathaa unke milaanevaale pratyay ko samanvay yaa samaadhaan kehete hai or unki yah paksh se samanvayonmukhi puri prakriya virodh samanvay nyaay yaa dwand-samanvay vidhi athwa trikvaav naam se jaani jaati he
 In the above example, "sat" aspect, "asat" counterpart and "bhava" are co-ordinates
 is prakaar hegel ke virodh-samanvay-nyaay main paksh, pratipaksh, evam samanvay teenon hi kaa samaahar hota he
 To understand it more clearly, let us take our external knowledge and see how this rule applies in it
 hegel ke kathananusaar, kisi ko bhi bahya gyaan tabhi hota he jab pehle gyey padaarth kaa vishay dwaara gyaata yaa vishayi kaa virodh hota he or tatpashchaat vah vishayi us vishay se vishisht hokar apane aapmen samavisht hota he
 Here there is the "subject" aspect and the "subject" counterpart and they are coordinated with the subject's knowledge gained by the subject
 vastut: hegel ke mat main vichaar evam vishwa ke saare hi vikaas kii pragati, anivaary rup se, isi virodh samanvay nyaay ke anusaar hoti he
 He has made a sad but laudable attempt to demonstrate the utility of this justice in the interpretation of almost all areas of experience or the world
 unka kathan he ki vishwa main jo kuch bhi hota he vah sab is niyam ke anusaar hota he or iske parinamswaroop uttarottar naveen bhedprabhed yaa padaarthon kaa aavirbhaav hota rahata he
 No distinction is ever made out of absolute suffixes or Parbrahms, nor is Brahm itself separated from prepossessing substances, but in the world there is never an end to the potentialities of Brahm, and from this point of view, we can also call it worldly
 hegel ne isi brahm yaa nirpeksh pratyay main samast bhoot, vartmaan evam bhavi bhedon kaa samanvay karne kaa praytn kiya he
 "hegel's Brahma is a person or not?" This question is disputed
 hellden aadi pandit use vyakti maanate hai; parantu pro
 mekatagart aadi vidwaanon kii sammati main vah vyakti nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Hegel was, no doubt, a staunch satirist thinker
 unke anusaar kaary apane kaaran main apni abhivyakti se purv bhi maujuud rahata he
 In fact, they considered cause and action and virtue and quality as integral and interdependent to each other
 jis prakaar kaarnon ke abhaav main kaary nahin ho saktaa athwa gun bina guni ke nahin rah saktaa, usee prakaar, hegel ke mat main, kaary ke abhaav main bhi koi ghatana yaa vastu kaaran nahin kahala sakati, thik vaise hi jaise bina gun ke guni nahin
 Hegel's absolute suffix or Brahman, sometimes referred to as God, is not agnostic like the thorn's "orthodoxy or objects of its own
" vah hamaare chintan kaa vishay ban saktaa he, kyonki ham or hamaari chintanashkti, buddhiparichhinn hone par bhi, usee ke anuroop hai
 In other words, since the laws of our limited thought are the same as those of the universal God or his thought world, he can be aware of us through wisdom
 hegel ke is vichaarrup praytn se nihsandeh hi us chaudee khai ko paatane kaa shlaghneey kaary kiya jo kaant ne parmaarthik or vyaavhaarik vastuon ke bich main, unhen kramash: agyeya evam gyey bataakar, khod daali thi
 Hegelian philosophy, despite being an extremely important, excellent and keen intellectual endeavor, is not free from objections

 The subjects related to Vedic branches could be many
 udaahranarth, prayek vaidic shakha se sambhddha karmkand, aachaar aadi kii apni apni parampara thi
 The subjects were not related to all those subjects, but only to the pure pronunciation of the Vedic mantras, subjects such as the Vedic codes and their textual readings, etc
, or the interrelationship of the vocalizations and sometimes the verses
 yahan vaidic shakhaon ke prarambh, swaroop or pravriti ko sankshep main samaj lenaa aavashyak he
 There came a time in the history of Indian Vedic culture while the Aryan caste mystics stored traditional Vedic mantras as Vedic codes

 The Vedic codes could have been protected only by the Sravana tradition of Guru Shishya

 Vedic mantras and their codes have been considered as the holiest treasures of the Aryan race from the beginning
 unki suraksha or adhyayan kii ore arya manishiyon kaa sadaa se dhyaan rahaa he
 This vision gave rise to Vedic intrigues in India
 vaidic samhitaon kii suraksha or arthgyan kii drushti se hi vaidic vidwaanon ne tattat samhitaon ke padpath kaa nirmaan kiya
 After some time, respectively, the recitation of the text etc
 also started

 Originally this was the subject of the protests

 The fellows of the Vedic branches were called 'charan'
 in charnon kii vidvatsabhaon yaa vidyasabhaaon ko 'parishad' kaha jaataa tha
 The figures were composed a lot in the sutra style, so the 'parshadasutra' is often used in the ancient texts for the exponents
 yaskacharya ke nirukt main kaha gaya he : That is, the Samhita is based on the posts and the trend of the Pratyaksha of all branches has been to consider the posts as the basis of the Samhita
 isse yah dhwani nikalati he ki pracheen kaal main sab vaidic shakhaon ke apane-apane praatishakhya rahe honge
 Probably similar to the Vedic branches, their primordials also disappeared

 The first 1-15 chapters of this chapter describe topics related to education and grammar, and the last three chapters discuss verses
 chhandon ke vishay kaa pratipaadan, yah dhyaan main rakhane kii baat he, kisi anya praatishakhya main nahin he
 The detailed rendering of the sequence is also a notable feature of this pattern

 Apart from these, a Sam Pratyakhyakya by the name of Raktantra and a second Atharva Pratyakhyakha has been published in three readers

 All his vision looks before Panini grammar
 ho saktaa he, unke uplabdh granthon par kahin-kahin panini vyakaran kaa prabhaav ho, par yah bahut hi kam maatra main he
 It is a matter of remembering that in the Mahabhashya, Paninian grammar is called sarva-veda-parishad Shastra
 shiksha, vyakaran ke aitihaasik vikaas ke adhyayan kii drushti se or tattad vaidic samhitaon ke paramparaprapt paath kii suraksha ke liye bhi praatishakhyon kaa atyant mahatv he
 Although scholarly studies, especially Western scholars, have shown special interest in the critical study and publication of the epigraphs, deprivation and diabolism seem to be increasing in the tradition of the study of these texts over the centuries
 yahi kaaran he ki praatishakhyon main or unki vyakhyaon main bhi anek paath ashuddh yaa aspasht hai
 This is the reason why a great text like Sayan Bhasya of Rigveda Samhita does not even mention Rig Vedapratisakhya even once and in many places, many verses have been tried to prove the treaty by the forced Paninisutra
 aavashyaktaa he ki praatishakhyon ke prakaash main vaidic samhitaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaae

 Nostradamus was a 16th-century prophet of France
 nastredamas keval bhavishyavaktaa hi nahi, doctor or shikshak bhi the
 They treated plague-like diseases
 inhone ne apni kavitaao ke dwaara bhavishya main hone vaali ghatnao kaa varnan kiya tha
 Most academic and scientific sources state that the relationships shown between the events of the world and the words of Nostradamus are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations or are so weak as to present them as evidence of the power to tell the real future It is useless
 kuch galat vyakhyaayein yaa galat anuwaad to jaanboojhkar bhi kiye gaye hai
 In spite of this too, in the twentieth century the alleged prophecies of Nostradamus became very popular among the common people and they were credited with the prediction of several major world events
 bhavishya kii baton ko hajaaron saal pehle ghoshnaa karne ke liye mashhoor nastredamas kaa janm 14 disambar 1503 ko france ke ek chote se gaanv saint remi main hua
 His name was Michel de Nostredamus, since childhood, he was particularly interested in studies and acquired special expertise in esoteric subjects like mathematics, physiology and astrology besides Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages
 nastredamas ne kishoravastha se hi bhavishyavaaniyan karnaa shuru kar di thi
 His growing interest in astrology made parents worried because fundamentalist Christians did not see this discipline well at that time
 jyotish se unka dhyaan hataane ke liye unhe chikitsa vigyaan padhne maant pelior bhej diya gaya jiske baad teen varsh kii padhai puri kar nastredamas chikitsak ban gaye
 On 23 October 1529, he received his doctorate from Mont Polier itself and became a teacher in the same university
 pehali patni ke dehanth ke baad 1547 main europe jaakar unhone ain se duusari shaadi kar lee
 During this time he earned a special name as a prophet
 ek kinvadanti ke anusaar ek baar nastredamas apane mitra ke saath italy kii sadakon par tahal rahe the, unhonen bheed main ek yuvak ko dekha or jab vah yuvak paas aayaa to use aadar se sir jhukaakar namaskara kiya
 The friend asked the reason for this, to his surprise, he said that this person will go ahead and accept the posture of the Pope
 kinvadanti ke anusaar vastav main vah vyakti phelis pereti tha jisane 1585 main pope chunaa gaya
 There are many such stories about Nostradamus, but there is no evidence for any of them
 nastredamas kii bhavishyavaaniyan kii khyaati sun france kii maharani catherine ne apane bacchon kaa bhavishya jaanane kii ichha jaahir kii
 Nostradamus had known by his own wish that both the children of the Queen would be fulfilled at a young age, but could not dare to tell the truth, and offered their words in symbolic verses
 isak prakaar vah apni baat bhi kah gaye or maharani ke man ko koi chot bhi nahin pahunchi
 Since then, Nostradamus decided that he would express his prophecies in the same way
 1550 ke baad nastredamas ne chikitsak ke peshey ko chhod apana puraa dhyaan jyotish vidya kii sadhana par laga diya
 From the same year he also started taking out his annual Panchag
 usamen grahon kii sthiti, mausam or fasalon aadi ke bare main purvanumaan hote the
 It is said that most of them proved to be true
 nastredamas jyotish ke saath hi jaadu se judi kitabon main ghanton duube rahete the
 Nostradamus completed the writing of the first part of his first treatise Century in 1555, first published in French and later in English, German, Italian, Roman, Greek languages
 is pustak ne france main itnaa tahalaka machaaya ki yah us samay mahangi hone ke baad bhi haathon-haath bik gai
 Some of his interpreters believe that events related to World War I, Napoleon, Hitler and Kennedy etc
 can be clearly seen in many verses of this book
 vyakhyakaaron ne nastredamas ke anek chando main tisare vishwayuddh kaa purvanumaan or duniya ke vinaash ke sanket ko bhi samaj lene main safalataa praapt kar lene kaa daawa kiya he
 Most academic and scientific sources say that these interpretations are the result of mistranslation or misunderstanding, and some mistakes have been made intentionally
 nastredamas ke jivan ke antim saal bahut ksht se gujarey
 The Justice Department of France was investigating against him whether he actually resorted to witchcraft
 yadi yah aarope siddh ho jaataa, to ve dand ke adhikari ho jate
 But the investigation concluded that he is not a magician but a master of astrology

 He is said to have already predicted the date and time of his death
 ek vyakhya ke anusaar "nastredamas ne apane sambandh me jo kuch gini-chuni bhavishyavaaniyan kii thi, unamem se ek yah bhi thi ki unki maut ke 225 saal baad kuch samajavirohi tatv unki kabr khodenge or unke avasheshon ko nikaalane kaa prayaas karenge lekin turant hi unki maut ho jaaegi
 This is exactly what happened
