 donon hi brahm ko chidachidvishisht maanate hai or donon hi ke mat se moksh kaa upaay parmopasya kii 'prapatti' he
 The following things are prominent in Ramanand sect - ramanand ne udaar bhakthi kaa maarg pradarshit kiya
 Among his disciples were Julaha, Chamar, Jat, Rajput, etc
 and women
 bhakthi kaa dwaar sabhi ke liye mukt tha
 He founded the Vairagi sect for this reason

 The second new ideology that was intended to change was to include all Hindus and Muslims

 In the Ramanand Sampraday called Sri Sampradaya, the word 'sri' means 'sita' in place of Lakshmi

 Ram is received by Sita only by the opinion of Ramanand ji
 maharani sita purushakarbhuta hai or vahi upaay bhi hai
 Ramananda has interpreted the creature in a simple way - which is always situated in a form, which is different from God in different forms in different bodies than ignorant, conscious, always subjugated, subtle to subtle, distinct differences

 Thus the process also included the presence of three essential elements associated with street plays from the beginning - an enclosure as a performance venue, the intimate connection of the audience and actors, and the stories, events and events directly connected to the audience's everyday life
 Staging plays
 isi kaa viksit rup hamen tab bhi dekhne ko miltaa he jab aaj se lagbhag dhaai-teen hazaar varsh pehle yunaan main thespis naamak abhinayta ghodagadee yaa bhaisagadee main saamaan ladakar, shahar-shahar ghumkar sadakon par, chauraahon par athwa bazaaron main akelaa hi naatakon kaa manchan kiya karata tha
 In India, there is a mention of the tradition of reciting the epic Ramayana from place to place through two storytellers, namely Luv and Kush
 ye lav-kush ram ke putron ke rup main to prasiddh hai hi, baad main inhen ke samaantar nat yaa abhinayta ko bhi hamaare yahaan kushilav ke naam se hi janaa jane laga
 Probably this is the reason that in view of the plays being continuously staged in the open, Bharat has also mentioned the metaphor named 'veethi' in his Natyashastra under the visual interpretation
 aaj bhi andhra pradesh main lokanaty parampara kii ek style kaa naam kii 'vithi naatakam' miltaa he or aadhunik nukkad naatak ko bhi isi naam se janaa jaataa he
 In the medieval period, the Natya Natya-style play was born and developed in the form of folk plays in various provinces, regions and dialects of India
 usee ke samaantar pashchim main bhi carch athwa dharmik naatakon ke rup main england, france, germany or spain aadi deshon main aise naatakon kaa prachlan shuru hua jo bible kii ghatnaon par aadhaarit hote the or mulat: dharm ke prachaar ke liye hi khele jate the
 These plays were also staged in the open, in the plains and squares and markets, and only in the light of day, whereas in our plays the plays were played mostly in the night almost from the beginning
 iske kaaran bhartiya naatakon main prakaash vyavastha kaa bahut vikaas hua
 The history of the street plays as we know them in the modern era can be seen in the form of communal lines, morning ferries and protest marches during India's freedom struggle
 isi kaa ek vidhivat rup ipta jaisi sanstha ke janm ke rup main saamne aayaa, jab puure bharat main alag-alag kala madhyamon ke log ek saath aakar mili or krantikari geeton, naatakon va nrityon ke manchanon or pradarshnon se videshi shashan evam satta kaa virodh aarambh hua
 Thus what can be an ideal system to resist and parallel any wrong arrangement - this is the structure on which the axis of the street plays
 kabhi vah kisse-kahaniyon kaa prachaar tha, kabhi dharm or kabhi rajnatik vichaardhaara
 One can underline this fact in any era and era
 aaj to sthiti yah ho gai he ki badi-badi vyavsaayik-vyaparik companiyaan apane utpaadanon ke prachaar ke liye nukkad naatakon kaa prayog kar rahi hai, sarkari tantra apni nitiyon-nirdeshon ke prachaar ke liye nukkad naatak jaise madhyam kaa sahaara letaa he or raajnneetik dal chunaav ke dinon main apane dal ke prachaar-prasar ke liye is vidha kii ore aakarshith hote hai
 In such a situation, the multitude of forms and colors of the street plays are visible

 Giving a 1 / 2 rating to the film Komal Nahata on BBC Hindi wrote - "it would be better to call this film not 'satya' but 'satyanash'"
 " Measuring the humidity of the atmosphere is called hygrometer
 bahut se aise padaarth hai, jaise salphurik amla, calcium chloride, phosforus pentaxide, saadhaaran namak aadi, jo jalawaashp ke shoshak hote hai
 Using these, chemical humidiometers are made, by which the amount of water vapor present in a certain volume of air is determined in grams
 ek bottle main phosforus pentaxide or do teen naliyon main calcium chloride bharkar taul lete hai
 Then, add this bottle to a series of air conditioners
 chooshak chaalu kar dene par jal girtaa he or rikt sthaan main hawa bottle tathaa naliyon ke bheetar se hokar aati he
 The aforesaid chemical substances absorb the water vapor and the dry air gets collected in the sucker
 bottle tathaa naliyaan rasinic padaarthon sahit phir tauli jaati hai
 By subtracting the first weight from it, the amount of water vapor, which was within the collected air, is known
 aise yantra dwaara ardrata kaa pataa badi sookshmata se lagaaya ja saktaa he, parantu parinaam praapt karne main samay lagata he
 Other hygrometers are known as Dine, Daniel or Reno
 inke dwaara ham osank gyaat karte hai
 Then you can find relative humidity by looking at the table of Reno, the value of the vapor pressure at this dew point and the temperature of the air
 inke atirikt vaayu main kisi samay nami kii taatkaalik jaankaree ke liye geele or sookhe balbawale ardrathamapi kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 It is also called a psychrometer
 is upkaran main do samaan tapamapi ek hi takhte par jade rahete hai
 The cloth is wrapped on the bulb of a thermometer, which is always wet
 iske liye kapade kaa ek chor neeche rakhe hue bartan ke pani main duba rahata he
 There is evaporation of cloth water, which depends on the humidity of the air
 jab vaayu main nami kii kami hoti he to vashpibhawan adhik or iskaa mukhya ang ek bal hota he, jo newnaadhik ardrata ke anusaar ghatata-badhata he
 When there is excess of moisture in the air, the evaporation is reduced
 vashpibhawan ke anusaar geele balbawale tapamapi kaa paara neeche utar aata he or donon tapamapiyon ke paathon main antar paaya jaataa he
 This difference in their lessons depends on the amount of air humidity
 yadi vaayu jalawaashp ke santrupt ho to donon tapamapiyon ke paath ek hi rahete hai
 In Reno's table the pressure of water vapor is given to suit this difference at different temperatures, so the values of relative humidity and dew point are obtained by taking the text of both thermometers
 tapamapiyon par vaayu badalati rahe, is uddeshy se kuch cicrometeron ko ek chaal se ghumaane kaa aayojan kiya rahata he
 The plank is rotated four times per second by the motor, so that the air always changes
 aise cicrometeron ke liye aapekshik ardrata kii sarini isi paribhraman sankhya 4 ke anukool banaai jaati he
 The surface of the cruise separates moving
 is dosha ko dur karne or shuddh maapan ke liye anya upaay upaay kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 In one type of device, both thermometers are held within a double metal tube and the air inside the tube is replaced by a small electric fan
 aisi dohari diwaal kii nalee se vikiranon kaa bhi prabhaav nahin padane paata
 But the humidity value cannot be determined quickly from the above hygrometers
 iske atirikt vaayu main nami kii maatra kshan-kshan par badalati rahati he tathaa hamen kshan prati kshan nami kaa pataa puure din bhar kaa jaananaa aavashyak hota he
 We cannot also study the humidity of the upper part of the atmosphere by the aforesaid instruments
 in uddeshyon kii purti ke liye bal kii lambaai par nami ke prabhaav ko dekhakar sarvapratham di sosyur ne ek ardratadarshak kaa nirmaan kiya
 This hygienist has a clean, clean hair
 bal kaa ek sira dhaatu ke tukade ke baarik chhidr main pench dwaara jakadaaa rahata he
 At the bottom, a strand of hair is wrapped on a pulley
 tab bal ke sire ko ghirani kii baari main pench dwaara jakad diya jaataa he
 a pointer is placed on the pulley axis
 bal kii lambaai badhane par ek kamaani ke kaaran ghirani ek ore or ghatane par duusari ore gumti he or uske saath sanketak vrittakar maapni par chalata he
 The calibration of the scale is done in humidity, hence the percentage of humidity on the scale can be read immediately from the location of the indicator
 isi ke aadhaar par swalekhi ardrathamapi banaae hai, jinke dwaara graph par 24 ghante athwa puure saptaah ke prayek kshan kii ardrata kaa maan ankit kiya jaataa he
 But one hair does not have enough confirmation that graphs can be written with a pointer indicator, especially when such a device is used to study the upper atmosphere in a balloon or plane
 pushtataa ke liye baalo ke guchchhe athwa rassi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 But this decreases the accuracy of the hygrometer
 dekha gaya he ki ghode kaa ek bal manushya ke baalo kii rassi se adhik upyogi hota he
 Therefore they are used, but due to another defect, it cannot be used in cold regions
 taap ghatane se jalawaashp ke prati bal kii chetanta ksheen ho jaati he
 The device is then affected by moisture after a long period of time
 -40° sein
 par to bal bilkul kunthit ho jaataa he
 Now some electrical conductive materials have been detected whose electrical barrier changes due to water vapor
 danmor ne aise ardrathamapi kaa nirmaan upree vayumandal ke adhyayan ke liye kiya he
 It has a thin layer of lithium fluoride whose electrical barrier changes due to water vapor
 yah parat vidyutparipath main lagi rahati he
 The change of the barrier causes the current to decrease, so the humidity can be read at the ruler's scale
 dharamapi ke sanketak ko swalekhi banaakar ardrata kaa maan graph par ankit bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Balloons and airplanes often have similar hygrometers

 Amarushatakam is a lyrical phrase in Sanskrit
 iske rachayita amru yaa amaruuk hai
 Its composition is considered to be the ninth century
 isamen 100 shloke hai jo atyant shringarpurn evam manoram hai
 It is a century by name, but the number of its verses is more than one hundred
 sookhtisangrahon main amaruuk ke naam se nirdisht padyon ko milakar samast shlokon kii sankhya 163 he
 Some of the fame of this century can be traced to its rich commentaries
 iske upar das vyakhyaaon kii rachana vibhinn shatabdiyon main kii gai jinamein arjuna varmdev kii 'rasik sanjivani' apni vidvatta tathaa maarmikata ke liye prasiddh he
 In Anandavardhan's opinion, the emancipators of Amaruk are so succulent and soulful that even when they are small, they have the ability to manage the poetry
 sanskrit ke alankarikon ne dhvanikavy ke udhaaharan ke liye iske bahut se padya uddhrut kar inaki saahitiyik sushamaa kaa parichay diya he
 Amaruk is not a poetess, but is a perfect poetess, whose main goal is the abundant flourishing of juice in poetry
 amarushtak ke padya shringaar ras se purna hai tathaa prem ke jite jaagate chatakile chitra khinchne main vishesh samarth hai
 Extremely subtle and psychological analysis of the adorable attitudes existing in various stages of lovers and girlfriends is the main feature of these Saras verses
 kahin pati ko pardesh jane kii taiyaari karte dekhakar kamini kii hridayvihvalata kaa chitra he, to kahin pati ke aagaman kaa samachar sunakar sundari kii harsh se chhalkati hui aakhon or viksit smit kaa ruchik chithran hai
 Mahakavi Bihari and Padmakar of Hindi have presented a succinct translation of several verses of Amaruk

 Kambuj or Cambose is the ancient Sanskrit name of Cambodia
 bhootpurv indochin prayadweep main sarvapracheen bhartiya upnivesh kii sthapana phunaan pradesh main pratham shatee i
 ke lagbhag hui thi
 For nearly 600 years, Funan contributed significantly in promoting and propagating Hindu culture in this region
 tatpashchaat is kshetra main kambuj yaa kamboj kaa mahan rajya sthapit hua jiske adbhut aishwarya kii gauravpurn parampara 14veen sadi i

 The remains of this ancient splendor are still present today in places called Angkorvat, Angkorthom
 kamboj kii pracheen dantakthaon ke anusaar is upnivesh kii neenv 'aryadesh' ke raja kambu swayambhuv ne daali thi
 He came to the country of Kambose under the inspiration of Lord Shiva and with the help of the king of the Naga caste settled here, he established a new kingdom in this wild desert which culminated in the lush, beautiful region with the wonderful magic of Nagraj
 kambu ne nagaraj kii kanya meraa se vivaah kar liya or kambuj rajvansh kii neenv daali
 It is also possible that this colony located in Indochina was also related to Indian Kamboj
 teesri shatee i
 main bharat kii uttar-pashchimi seemaa par basanevo murundon kaa ek rajdoot phunaan pahunchaa tha or sambhavat: kamboj ke ghode apane saath vahaan laayaa tha
 The founder of the first historical dynasty of Kamboj was Shrutavarman who liberated the country of Kamboj from Funan
 iske putr shreshthavarman ne apane naam par shreshthpur naamak rajdhani basaai jiske khandhar laos ke watfu pahari ke paas sthit hai
 Thereafter, Bhavavarman, who belonged to both the Funan and Kambose dynasties, started a new dynasty and settled the capital named Bhavpur in his own name
 bhavavarman tathaa iske bhai mahendravarman ke samay se kamboj kaa vikasyug prarambh hota he
 The old kingdom of Funan was now dilapidated and soon merged into this new turbulent empire
 mahendravarman kii mrityu ke pashchaat unka putr ishanvarman gaddi par baitha
 This majestic king extended the boundaries of the kingdom of Kamboj far and wide
 usne bharat or champa ke saath rajanyik sambandh sthapit kiye or ishanpur naam kii ek nai rajdhani kaa nirmaan kiya
 Ishaanavarman married his daughter to Jagadharma, the king of Champa, whose son Prakashadharma became king of Champa after the death of his father
 isse prathit hota he ki champa is samay kamboj ke raajnneetik prabhaav ke antargat tha
 After Ishanavarman, the names of the kambhoj kings are found in Bhavavarman II and Jayavarman I
 jayavarman ke pashchaat 674 i
 main is rajvansh kaa ant ho gaya
 Shortly after, the power of Kamboj began to wane and gradually in the 8th century AD, the Kamboj dominance of the Shalendra kings of Java was established over the country
 8veen sadi i
 kaa kamboj itihaas adhik spasht nahin he kintu 9veen sadi kaa aarambh hote hi is pracheen samrajya kii shakti maanon pun: jivit ho uthi
 The credit for this is given to Jayavarman II
 usne angakore vansh kii neenv daali or kamboj ko java kii adheenta se mukt kiya
 He probably called Hiranyadas from India and performed tantric activities for the protection of his kingdom
 is vidvan brahman ne devraj naamak sampradaay kii sthapana kii jo sheeghra hi kamboj kaa rajdharm ban gaya
 Jayavarman made his capital in the cities of Kuti, Hariharalaya and Amarendrapur respectively, making it clear that almost all of the territory of present-day Cambodia was under him and the center of the power of the state gradually moved from east to west and finally the territory of Angkor
 Was established in jayavarman dwitiya ko apane samay main kambujrajendra or uski mahraani ko kambujrajalakshmi naam se abhihit kiya jaataa tha
 From this time, foreign authors of Cambodia's ancient name Kambuj or Kambhoj also started using it

 944 i
 main kamboj kaa raja rajendravarman tha jiske samay ke kai brihad abhilekh sundar sanskrit kavyastylee main likhe milte hai
 The period up to 1001 AD is significant in the history of Kamboj because during this period the borders of Kamboj touched the southern part of China, Laos was under it and its political influence extended to Syria and northern Malaya
 suryavarman pratham ne praaia: samast syam par kamboj kaa aadhipaty sthapit kar diya or dakshin brahmadesh par bhi akraman kiya
 He was a scholar of literature, justice and grammar and, despite being a Buddhist himself, was a lover and protector of Shaivite and Vaishnava religions
 usne rajacin hone ke samay desh main chale hue grihayuddh ko samaapt kar rajya kii sthiti ko pun: sudrudh karne kaa praytn kiya
 After conquering North Champa, Suryavarman made him a proud kingdom of Kamboj but soon had to give up to King Jaihari Varmana of South Champa
 is samay kamboj main grihayudhon or padosi deshon ke saath anban ke kaaran kaaphi ashaanti rahi
 Once again during the reign of Jayavarman VII, the ancient fame of Kamboj began to unfurl
 usne ek vishaal sena banaai jisamen syam or brahmadesh ke sainik bhi sammilit the
 Jayavarman also tried to conquer Anam by invading him, but due to the constant wars, the military power of the Shani Kambos began to decline, even in 1220 AD, the Kambos had to withdraw from Champa
 kintu phir bhi jayavarman saptam kii gananaa kamboj ke mahan rajyanirmaataaon main kii jaati he kyonk usame samay main kamboj ke samrajya kaa vistaar apnicharam seemaa par pahunchaa hua tha
 Jayavarman VII built his new capital at present Angkorthom
 iske khandhar aaj bhi sansar ke prasiddh pracheen avasheshon main gine jate hai
 The city had a high tower and a 110-meter-wide facade
 isaki lambaai saadhe aath mile ke lagbhag thi
 There were five lion gates of the city park, from which five huge Rajpaths used to go inside the city
 ye rajpath, beyon ke virat hindu mandir ke paas milte the, jo nagar ke madhya main sthit tha
 There were 66,625 persons employed in the temple and 3,400 villages had an income for its expenditure
 is samay ke ek abhilekh se gyaat hota he ki kamboj main 789 mandir tathaa 102 chikitsaalay the or 121 vaahni grih the
 After Jayavarman VII, many sites in the history of Kamboj are not very clear
 13veen sadi main kamboj main sudrudh raajnneetik shakti kaa abhaav tha
 According to some historians, Kamboj refused to assume the suzerainty of the Emperor Kuble Khan of China in the last phase of the 13th century
 1296 i
 main china se ek dootmandal angkorthom aayaa tha jiske ek sadsy shu-taan-kuan ne tatkaaleen kamboj ke vishay main vistrut tathaa manoranjak vrittant likhaa he jiskaa anuwaad francisi bhashaa main 1902 i
 main hua tha
 In the 14th century, new political power was emerging in the neighboring kingdoms of Kamboj and the Thai people of Siamese and Champa were constantly trying to move towards Kamboj
 parinaam yah hua ki kamboj par do ore se baari dabaav padane laga or vah in donon deshon kii chakki ke paaton ke bich pisane laga
 Gradually, the ancient importance of Kamboj was gone and now this country became an ordinary backward state of Indochina

 In the war between Siamese and the French in 1904–41, some of the territory of Cambodia was given to Syam, but after the Second World War, in 1945 AD this part was regained
 is samay cambodia main swatantraaa andolan bhi chal rahaa tha jiske parinamswaroop france ne cambodia ko ek nayaa samvidhan pradaan kiya 
 But this did not satisfy the nationalists there and they forced the French to sign a new samanate in 1949, which allowed them to accept Cambodia's independent political power, but still kept the country under the French Union i went
 iske viruddh cambodia ke prabhaavshaalee raja nordam simhanuk ne apana rashtriya andolan jari rakhaa
 With their efforts, Cambodia soon became an independent nation and was elected the first Prime Minister of its country
 kamboj vaastavik arth main bhartiya upnivesh tha
 The religion of the residents there, their culture and civilization, literary traditions, architecture and language - all had an indelible mark of Indianness, whose philosophy is still spontaneous to the audience of Cambos

 For example, only a portion of a huge inscription of Rajendravarman is presented here in which Shiva is worshiped: puraane arab paryatakon ne kamboj ko hindu desh ke naam se thik hi abhihit kiya
 The official language of Kambuj was Sanskrit in ancient times, it was gradually replaced by Pali due to the propagation of Buddhism and even today it remains the main language in the religious region
