 yah lekh yaksha prashn naamak ek hindi kahawat par he
 For other Yaksha articles, see: Yaksha mahabharat main ek prasang he ki pyaase pandavon ko pani pine se rokte hue yaksha ne pehle apane prashnon kaa uttar dene kii shart rakhi thi
 Yaksha question is also a Hindi proverb
 yah kahawat kisi aisi samasya yaa pareshaani ke sandarbh main prayukt hoti he jiskaa abhi tak koi samaadhaan nahin nikaala gaya he yaa samasya jas-kii-tas bani hui he
 This saying called Yaksha question originated from the questions asked by the Yaksha to the Pandavas in the Mahabharata
 jab pandav apane vanvaas ke dinon main van-van bhatak rahe the tab ek din ve log jal kii khoj kar rahe the
 Yudhishthira first sent Sahadeva
 vah ek sarovar ke nikat pahunchaa or jaise hi jal pine ke liye jhukaa use ek vaani sunai di
 That voice was that of a Yaksha who wanted answers to his questions
 sahadev ne vaani ko ansuna kar pani pi liya or maaraa gaya
 After this other Pandava brothers also came and merged into Kaal's cheek
 tab ant main dharmraj yudhisthir aae or yaksha ke prashnon ke sahi-sahi uttar die or apane bhaiyon ko punah jivit paaya
 Therefore, even in the modern era, when there is a problem and no one has a solution, it is called a Yaksha-question
 yaksha kaa antim prashnon main se ek tha: In response to one of which Yudhishthira said: bhopal sambhag madhya bharat ke madhya pradesh rajya main ek prashasnic bhugolic ikai he

 The electron tube is a tube-like structure of glass or other material
 isamen ek electron kaa koi strot hota he jisase nikalakar electron duusare plate par jate hai
 The number of these electrons, their velocity, their energy etc
 are controlled in various ways
 is prakaar bahut si yuktiyaan electron nalika kaa prayog karke banati hai
 For example, television monitor, cathode-ray tube, vacuum diode, triode, thyratron, magnetron, klystron etc
 kuch prakaar kii naliyon kaa upyog radio-aavriti-shakti utapann karne main kiya jaataa he jiskaa upyog radio sangrahi tathaa radio preshi main kiya jaataa he
 These tubes are used for amplification, weakening and acquiring of weak signals
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki saadhaaran electron nalee kii khoj ne hi radio telephone, dhvanicitra, doorveekshan, radio aadi ko janm diya he
 Generally, an electron tube is made of two or more metal electrodes that are sealed in a vacuum chamber made of glass or metal
 dhruv ek duusare se pruthakkrut hote hai
 a pole is called a minuscule whose function is the production of electrons
 duusare dhruv ko dhanagar athwa pattica kehete hai jo runagra kii apeksha dhan vibhav par rakhaa jaataa he
 Thus the electrons in the electric field installed in the electron tube move from negative pole to positive pole and an electron current starts flowing under the poles
 ek saadhaaran paripath, jisamen aisi nalee kaa upyog kiya gaya he, akruti 1 main dikhaaya gaya he
 In the outer circuit, electrons go from the positive to the negative through the source
 aisi samaan vishitatavaali nalee, jisamen do dhruv hote hai, dvadhrivi kehalaati he
 In some tubes, another pole is placed which is called the grid
 On proper control of the grid potential, the control of the electrode in the tube and special changes can be made
 pehle pahal prayog main laai janevaali naliyon main is dhruv kii apni ek vishesh banaavat thi or isi banaavat ke kaaran ise grid kehete hai
 The tubes used nowadays have many such poles and these tubes take their name on the number of these poles, such as a tri-pole with three poles, a quadrilateral with four poles, a pancholar with five poles, And so on
 adhiktar electron praapt karne ke liye runagra ko tapt kiya jaataa he
 These types of tubes are called the calcific tubes
 parantu kuch vishesh prakaar kii aisi naaliyaan hoti hai jinako tapt karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 They are called cold minus tubes, for example gas photo tube, voltage control tube, etc
 can be mentioned
 electron naliyaan kai prakaar kii hoti hai
 The simplest tube is bipolar, then there are triploid, quadruplic, punctiform tube, panchipolar, saccular etc
 inke atirikt clistron, maganatron, pragami tarang nalee ityadi vishesh prakaar kii naliyaan bhi hai jinka prayog ucch aavriti par hota he
 In the negative beam tubes, electron beam is used to generate light, and thus the electrical power can give visual results
 saadhaaran runagra kiran nalee kaa vishesh rup othikan nalee he jiskaa prayog doorveekshan main kiya jaataa he
 Light is used in photoelectric tubes to produce electrical effects
 kabhi kabhi nirvaat naliyon main thodi si gas chhod di jaati he jisase unke lakshanik vakron main parivartan ho jaae or ve kuch vishisht kaaryo main laai ja saken
 There are two types of electron tubes: jon prakaash raav janumala naamak andhra pradesh ke prakasham jile main san 1957 agast 14 ko janme, johny liver hindi film ke ek prasiddh hasya abhinayta he

DNAM Arjan Singh, ADM Bhaskar Soman bhartiya daawa Pakistani claim pakistani daawa' Indian claim 1965 kaa bharat-paak yuddh un muthbhedon kaa naam he jo donon deshon ke bich april 1965 se sitambar 1965 ke bich hui thi
 It is also known as the Second War of Kashmir
 bharat or pakistan ke bich jammu or kashmir rajya par adhikaar ke liye bantwaare ke samay se hi vivaad chal rahaa he
 In 1947, the first war between India and Pakistan was also fought for Kashmir
 is ladaai kii shuruuaat pakistan ne apane sainikon ko ghuspaithiyon ke rup main bhej kar is ummid main kii thi ki kashmir kii janata bharat ke khilaaf vidroh kar degi
 This campaign was named by Pakistan as Yudhbhiyan Gibraltar
 paanch maheene tak chalane vaale is yuddh main donon pakshon ke hajaaron log maare gayi
 The war ended with the United Nations declaring a ceasefire and an agreement on both sides in Tashkent
 is ladaai kaa adhikansh hissaa donon pakshon kii thal sena ne ladaa
 Before the Kargil War, there was never such a large military gathering in Kashmir
 yuddh main paidal or bakhtarband tukadiyon ne vayusena kii madad se anek abhiyaanon main hissaa liya
 Like many wars between the two sides, both sides did not reveal many details of this war
 bharat or pakistan ke 1947 main hue batwaare ke samay se hi bharat or pakistan ke bich kai muddo par tanatani chal rahi thi haalanki jammu or kashmir kaa mudda isame sabase bada tha par anya seemaa vivaad bhi the iname sabase pramukh kuccha kaa ran, jo ki ek banjar ilaaka he, ke batwaare par tha
 On 20 March 1965, Pakistan deliberately started skirmishes in the Rann of Kutch
 shuru main iname keval seemaa suraksha bal hi shaamil the par baad main dono deshon kii sena bhi yuddh main shaamil ho gayi 1 june 1965 main british pradhanmantri herold wilson ne dono paksho ke bich ladaai rukvaa kar is vivaad ko hal karne ke liye ek nishpaksh madhyasth nyaayalay kii sthapana kar di
 This court gave about 900 square kilometers of the Kutch run to Pakistan
 haalanki pakistan kaa daawa 3500 varg kilometre par tha
 
 kuccha ke ran main mili safalataa se utsahit pakistan ke rajanetaaon khaskar tatkaaleen videshmantri zulfikar ali bhutto ne rashtrpati or senadhyaksh general ayub khan par dabaav daalaa ki ve kashmir par hamale kaa aadesh de
 India had lost the war with China at that time and they believed that India was not in a position to wage war at that time
 iske alaava bhutto or unke vichaar se sahamat anya generalo yahya khan or tikka khan kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki kashmir kii janata bharat se aaazaad hokar pakistan se vilay kii icchhuk he or sainiko ko ghuspaithiyon ke vesh main bhejne par unke samarthan main vidroh kar degi
 At last General Ayub Khan came under pressure and ordered the covert operation of Operation Gibraltar
 is abhiyaan kaa mukhya uddeshy kashmir kii janata main vidroh bhadakaana or bhartiya sanchartantr evam parivahan vyavastha ko nuksaan pahuchana tha
 The infiltrators of Pakistan were quickly identified and instead of rebelling, the public informed the Indian soldiers and the operation completely failed
 5 agast 1965 ko 26000 se 3 xxrep 4 0 ke bich pakistani sainikon ne kashmir kii sthaneey aabaadi kii veshbhusha main niyantran rekha ko paar kar bhartiya kashmir main pravesh kar liya
 The Indian Army, after receiving information from the local population, crossed the Line of Control on 15 August
 
 In the beginning, the Indian Army had good success
 usne topakhane kii madad se teen mahatvapurn pahari thikaano par kabja jamaa liya
 Pakistan made significant progress in the Tithwal, Uri and Poonch regions, but on August 18, the strength of the Pakistani campaign had decreased significantly
 bhartiya atirikt tukadiya laane main safal ho gayi or bharat ne pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir main 8 kilometre andar ghus kar haji pir darre par kabja kar liya
 With this occupation Pakistan came into being
 abhiyaan jibraltar ke ghuspaithiye sanikon kaa rasta bharatiyon ke kabje main aa gaya tha or abhiyaan vifal ho gaya
 Not only this, Pakistan's command felt that Muzaffarabad, the important city of Pakistani Kashmir, is now going to be captured by Indians
 mujaffarabad par dabaav kam karne ke liye pakistan ne ek nayaa abhiyaan oparation grand slam shuru kiya
 On 1 September 1965, Pakistan, under an operation called Grand Slam, attacked the strategic city of Akhnoor, Jammu and Kashmir, from a strategic drift
 is abhiyaan kaa uddeshy kashmir ghati kaa shesh bharat se sampark tod tha taaki uski rasad or sanchaar vayvastha bhang kar di jaay
 India was not ready for this invasion of Pakistan and Pakistan was getting the benefit of large number of soldiers and better type of tanks
 shuruwat main bharat ko baari kshati uthaani padi is par bhartiya sena ne hawaii hamale kaa upyog kiya iske jawaab main pakistan ne punjab or srinagar ke hawaii thikaano par hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan was in a very good position during this phase of the war and this unexpected attack caused panic in the Indian camp
 akhnur ke pakistani sena ke haath main jane se bharat ke liye kashmir ghati mehar kaa khatra paidaa ho saktaa tha
 There were two reasons for the failure of the Grand Slam
 The first and the biggest reason was that Pakistan's military command changed its military commander at the mouth of the victory, in such a way, the Pakistani army was delayed by a day and those 24 In the hour, India got an opportunity to bring additional troops and goods to protect Akhnoor
 Local commanders of the Indian Army themselves were aghast why Pakistan gave up such an easy victory
 Used to be
 ek din kii deree ke baavjood bharat ke pashchimi kaman ke sena pramukh yah jaanate the ki pakistan bahut behatar sthiti main he or usko rokane ke liye unhone yah prastaav tatkaaleen senadhyaksh general choudhary ko diya ki punjab seemaa main ek nayaa morcha khol kar lahore par hamalaa kar diya jaay
 General Chaudhary did not agree with this, but the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri ignored the matter and ordered the attack
 bharat ne 6 sitambar ko antarrashtriya seemaa rekha ko paar kar pashchimi morche par hamalaa kar yuddh kii aadhikarik shuruwat kar di
 On September 6, India's 15th infantry unit faced a major Pakistani attack on the western side of the Ichogil Canal under the leadership of Major General Prasad, a World War II veteran
 icchhogil nahar bharat or pakistan kii vaastavik seemaa thi
 Major General Prasad's convoy was also attacked in this attack and had to leave his vehicle and run away
 bharat ne pratinkraman main barki gaanv ke sameep nahar ko paar karne main safalataa arjeet kar lee
 This led the Indian Army to attack Lahore air base and as a result the US appealed for a temporary ceasefire to evacuate its citizens from Lahore
 isi bich pakistan ne lahore par dabaav ko kam karne ke liye khemkaran par hamalaa kar us par kabja kar liya badale main bharat ne bediyaan or uske aas paas ke gaavon par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack on Lahore on 6 September included the first infantry division of the Indian Army along with three tank squads of the second armored subdivision
 ve turant hi seemaa paar karke icchhogil nahar pahuch gayi pakistani sena ne puliyaaon par raksha daste tainaat kar diye jin pulo ko bachaaya nahin ja saktaa tha unako uda diya gaya pakistan ke is kadam se bhartiya sena kaa aage badhnaa ruk gaya
 The 3 Jats, a unit of the Jat Regiment, crossed the canal and captured Dograi and Batapore
 usee din pakistani sena ne bakhtarband ikai or vayusena kii madad se bhartiya sena kii 15ve khand par bada pratiakraman kiya haalaaki isse 3 jat ko maamuli nuksaan hi hua lekin 15ve khand ko peeche hatana padaa or uske rasad or hathiyaaro ke vahno ko kaaphi kshati pahuchi
 The big officers of the Indian Army did not know the ground situation properly, so they ordered the 3 Jats to retreat, fearing that the 3 Jats had also suffered heavy losses, this caused a lot of disappointment to the command officer of the 3 Jats and later on Dograi Then there was a huge cost to capture
 8 disambar 1965 ko 5 maratha lit infentry kaa ek dasta ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn kasbe munaabaav main tainaat rajasthan sainya bal kly majbootee pradaan karne ke liye bheja gaya
 They were ordered to stop the Pakistani army from advancing but they could only protect their outpost amidst heavy bombardment by the artillery of the Pakistani army and aerial and infantry offensive, 5 Maratha soldiers showed great valor
 As a result, today that outpost is known as Maratha Hill
 5 maratha kii madad ke liye bheje gayi 3 gurkha or 954 baari topakhana kaa dasta pakistani vaayu sena ke baari hamale ke kaaran pahuch nahin paaya or rasad le kar barmer se aa rahi tren bhi garda road rail adde ke paas hamale kaa shikaar ho gayi 10 sitambar ko munaabao par pakistan kaa kabja ho gaya
 The events after 9 September crushed the proud pride of the armies of both the countries
 bharat ke 1 bakhtarband khand jise bhartiya sena kii shaan kaha jaataa tha ne sialkot kii disha main hamalaa kar diya
 Pakistan's relatively weak 6 armored division in Chhavinda was defeated badly
 The Indian Army lost about 100 tanks and was forced to retreat
 isse utsahit hokar pakistan kii sena ne bharatiyon par pratiakraman kar diya or bhartiya seemaa main aage ghus aayi
 For their final offensive, Pakistan along with its 1st Armored Division and 11th Infantry Division attacked Khemkaran with the intention of occupying Amritsar

 In the 1965 war, the largest wars of tanks were fought after World War II
 
 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armour was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, bharat fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; its guns out-ranged those of the Indian artillery, according to Pakistan's Major General T
H
 Malik
 At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armored cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armored divisions, the 1st and 6th armored divisions - the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armoured division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armoured Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which consisted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armoured Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armor, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar 
; They were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armored Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced same results, bharat's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armoured Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armour, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armoured Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armoured formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armoured Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armoured Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defence writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbour
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians the reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 apni or duusare kii haani ke bare main bharat or pakistan donon ne bilkul bemail daawey kiye
 The brief table of claims of the two countries is as follows There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agree that India had a upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below — The war was militarily inconclusive; Each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy — on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the U
N
 The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time United Nations intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on US ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, India had the better of the war
 New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest – it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 varg mile of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 varg mile of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 The United States and the Soviet Union used important diplomatic equipment to prevent further escalation in conflict between the two South Asian countries

 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, India budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war – which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India – and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", allegedly exposed Pakistani fabrications about the war, but all copies of the book were bought by Pakistan Army to prevent publication because the topic was "too sensitive"
 India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, India reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 December killing one Pakistani Army captain and on 2 February 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 Due to many strategic mistakes made by both India and Pakistan, this war came to a disastrous situation
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defense of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal P
C
 Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defence and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian Army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 " Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game – conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defence Analysis, USA
 The exercise concluded that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani Air Marshal and Commander in Chief of PAF during the war, Noor Khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; The war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan As such, India agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, India was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war - Now it's apparent to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, bharat's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further considerable damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates — India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, bharat focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, bharat established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy - India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defence Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defence of Lahore against the Indian army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", SM Burke writes - After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote - The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; This result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realised the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority – if not invincibility – of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during the early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defense spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defense spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government advisory
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, India did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, saanchaa:pakistani sena The Indian cricket team toured Bangladesh from 15 to 19 June 2014 to play a three-match one-day international series against the Bangladesh cricket team

 tapavidyut vah vidyut he jo do asmaan dhaatuon ke taron kii sandhi ko garm karne par in taron ke paripath main pravaahit hone lagati he
 Seebeck first invented this fact in 1821 by heating the treaty of copper and bismuth wires
 uparyukt paripath main utpann vidyutvahak bal nune hota he or isaki tivrata nimnlikhit baton par nirbhar karti he- The cold ends of wires of dissimilar metals are attached to the potentiometer to measure the electromotive force
 yadi paripath main kisi duusari dhaatu kaa taar shreneebaddh kar diya jaae to tapavidyut prabhaavon main parivartan nahin hota
 If the magnitude of the Seebeck electromotive force and the temperature of a cold joint and the temperature of a joint is zero degrees C, then the relation between e and t is known in the following formula: jahaan a or b tapavidyut sthiraank hai or inkaa maan paripath ke taron kii dhaatu par nirbhar karata he
 The thermodynamic constants of metals are given in the following table: bismuth or taanbe kii sandhi ke liye e = 45 t + 0
25T^2 microvolt he
 At low temperature, k is approximately proportional, but if it is very high, the value of k increases
 lohe or taanbe kii sandhi kaa e = 158 t - 0
0285T2 microvolt he
 Maximum e = 2,000 microvolts when the temperature is t = 275 Celsius
 ucch taap par e kaa maan ghatane lagata he tathaa 5500 sein degree yah shunya ho jaataa he 5500 sein
 se adhik taap badhane par kii disha badal jaati he or vidyutdhara vipareet disha main pravaahit disha main pravaahit hone lagati he
 Thus the flow of electric current in the opposite direction when the temperature increases is called reversal of thermodynamic flow and 550 ° c reversal heat
 taanbe or bismuth kii sandhi main yah prabhaav nahin hota
 There is a change in the electronegative force of the power when the temperature of any two wires increases by 10 Celsius, which is called the thermal power

 There are good combinations for measuring heat up to 1500 ° c and alloys of platinum and rhodium and platinum
 san 1834 main peltye ne avishkrut kiya ki do asmaan dhaatuon ke paripath main vidyut dhara pravaahit hone par ek sandhi garam or duusari sandhi thandi ho jaati he
 When electric current flows from iron to copper, a drop of oil in the capillary tube shows the heating effect by moving to the left side and the cooling effect when the copper is affected from the copper to the iron
 peltye prabhaav, sibek prabhaav kaa ulta he
 In 1854, William Tomson discovered that there is a difference between the two ends of the same metal wire if the temperatures of the two ends are different

 This fact is used in a device called a thermal beam, in which bismuth and etymony rods fall into the category
 is upkaran vikiran ooshmaa kaa anumaan evam pataa lagane ke liye karte hai
 The current generated in this device is measured by a galvanometer and is an index of the magnitude of radiation
 tapavidyut sanyojanon dwaara vyapaarik upyogita kii drushti se vidyut utpann karne ke anek prayaas kiye gaye hai, kintu jab ye prayaas aanshik rup se safal hue to gyaat hua ki inkaa vyapaarik mahatv naganya he
 There are two types of difficulties in generating electricity electrically by thermodynamic combination: theoretical and structural
 paryaapt vidyudvahak bal praapt karne ke liye bahut adhik sanyojanon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or anubhav se yah siddh ho chukaa he ki adhik sanshlisht taapapunj tikaoo nahin hota
 Even if this difficulty is overcome, theoretical reasons, which depend on thermodynamics, suggest that the efficiency of a heat exchanger that converts heat energy into electrical energy is never high

 Steel is an alloy
 praayah mishra dhaatuon ke gun us mishradhatu ko banane vaale sanghatakon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai
 Steel is stronger than iron
 kaansa, pital, taanka aadi mishratu hai
 Alloy is a term that is widely used for any metallic substance, unless it is a chemical element

 The truth is that the importance of bronze was so much in one era that the name of that era of development of human civilization has become 'bronze Age'
 yadhyapi shuddh dhaatuon ke kai upyogi gun hai, jaise ooshmaa or vidyut kii suchaalakata, tathaapi yantric or nirmaan sambandhi kaaryon main saadharantaya shuddh dhaatuen upyog main nahin laai jaatin, kyonki inamen aavashyak majbootee nahin hoti
 The most important method of making a metal stronger is metalworking
 is disha main 19veen shatabdi main bahut adhik prayaas hua, usee kaa fal he ki anek upyogi kaaryon ke liye aaj paanch hajaar se bhi adhik mishradhatuen uplabdh hai or nai mishradhatuen taiyaar karne ke liye nity nae nae prayog kiye ja rahe hai
 Today alloys with desired properties are made for any particular use
 dhaatuen jab kisi saamaanya vilyan, jaise amla, main ghulti he tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ko chhod detii hai or saadharantaya lavan banaati hai, kintu pighalaane par jab ve paraspar ghulti hai tab ve apane dhatvik gunon ke sahit rahati hai
 Such solid solutions of metals are called alloys
 anek mishradhaatuon main adhatuen bhi alp maatra main hoti hai, kintu sampurna kaa gun dhatvik rahata he
 Therefore, in 1939, the American Board of Examiners made the following definition of alloy - prarambh main mishradhatu kaa adhiktam upyog sikkon or aabhushanon ke banane main hota tha
 Copper, tin and zinc are 95 / 4 and 1 percent respectively in copper coins

 Platinum, gold and silver are used to add beauty to the colors of jewelery, to make them hard, strong and durable, or to mix them with other metals for sale at cheaper prices
 yah nishchay karnaa ki mishradhatuen saadhaaran mishran hai yaa rasinic yogic, ek jatil samasya he
 In some sense, these are chemical compounds, because when sodium succulents are made, then every piece of sodium in the cross causes a strong flame of light and the mercury becomes hot, a symptom of the compound being formed
 isi prakaar pighalate hue sone main jab aluminium dhaatu kaa ek tukdaa daalate hai, tab itani adhik ooshmaa utpann hoti he ki sampurna pighali hui dhaatu ujjwal prakashmay ho jaati he
 The color of many alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 udaahranarth, chaandi or jasta dona shwet rang ke hote hai, kintu inase jo mishradhatu banati he uskaa rang ati sundar gulabi hota he
 Gold is yellow and aluminum is white, but the color of their alloy is very shiny
 yah gun bhi yogicon kaa he
 On extracting the melting point of alloys, it is known that the behavior of alloys is of two types: The melting point of some alloys changes as the content of the metal changes, it is the property of the mixture and the melting point of some alloys is a constant temperature
 Occurs, indicating that alloys are compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke bhautik tathaa rasinic gun apni avyav dhaatuon ke gunon se bhinn hote hai or mishradhaatuon ke gun kisi bhi prakaar se avyav dhaatuon ke gunon ke madhya nahin hote
 This difference is due to the fact that when metals are melted together, they form many interconnected compounds and solid solutions
 mishradhatu kaa ghanatv apni avyav-dhaatuon ke madhya ghanatv se kam yaa adhik ho saktaa he
 The color of some alloys is completely different from the colors of their constituent metals
 ye apni avyav dhaatuon se kathortar, kintu kam lacheelee tathaa ghaatvarghy or adhik bhangur hoti hai
 The melting point of alloys is always less than the melting point of the melting element at maximum temperature
 or praaia: nunatam taap par pighalanevaali avyav dhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 For example, an alloy containing lead, tin, bismuth and cadmium is faulted at 75 ° C, while the melting point of tin, the metallic ingredient at the lowest temperature, is 232 ̊c
 ye sab ve gun hai jinke kaaran mishradhatuen shuddh dhaatuon se adhik moolyawaan ho jaati hai tathaa udyog main adhik upyogi siddh hoti hai
 As a result of detailed study of the organization and crystalline composition of alloys by the fruits mentioned above and by microscopes, X-ray spectral measurements, thermal and chemical analysis and other physical tests, alloys are placed in three categories
 yah vibhaajan mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuon ke parmaanuon kaa samooh kis prakaar se sangathit he, uske aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 These three categories are the following: is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main avyav dhaatuen jab pighali hui hoti hai, tab ve ek duusare main ghuli hui rahati hai, kintu thos hone par dhaatuon ke crystal alag-alag ho jate hai, arthath dhaatuen paraspar aviley hai
 In this way, the alloy is a mixture of pure crystals of each element metal, and on cooling, one element separates the metal into solid form
 udaahranarth, ek taral mishradhatu, jisamen matraanusaar 10 bhaag sisa or 90 bhaag tin hote hai, jab thandi kii jaati he tab shuddh tin ke crystal pratham usee prakaar se pruthak hote hai jis prakaar shuddh him ke crystal chini ke tanu vilyan main se thanda karne par pruthak hote hai
 The temperature at which tin crystals begin to separate is lower than the melting point of pure tin
 tin ke galnaank ko jab usamen sisa ghulaa rahata he, gyaat kar sise kaa anubhaar usee niyam dwaara nikaalte hai jis niyam se pani main ghuli vaston kaa anubhaar nikaalte hai
 By this method, several molecules of those metals have been extracted, which remain as separate atoms in the diluent solution
 sisa-antimony mishradhatu mishran shrenee kii he
 Antimony is brittle and lead soft
 mudran dhaatu sisi, antimony or atyant kam maatra main tin kii mishradhatu he
 This alloy has the hardness of antimony, but it is not as brittle as that
 is prakaar kii mishradhaatuon main ek avyav dhaatu ke parmaanu duusari avyav dhaatu ke crystalia dhaanche main bhalee-bhanti baith jate hai
 There are two different types of alloys of solid solution: tanba-nikal kii anek mishradhatuen jinka mahatvapurn upyog he, thos vilyan kii shrenee main aati hai
 For example, alloys from which nickel coins, rifle bullets and a wire have high electrical resistance are made
 canada ke bahut se khanijon main tanba or nikal ke sulphide hote hai, jinako galane se ek mishradhatu milti he
 It contains nickel and copper 67 and 28 percent and the remaining five percent contains iron and manganese respectively
 is mishradhatu ko monelle dhaatu kehete hai
 It is more tensile, flexible and corrosion resistant
 saadhaarant: dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar yogic nahin banaatin, kintu ooshmaa vishleshan dwaara gyaat hua he ki dhaatuen ek duusare ke saath sanyog kar bahut adhik sankhya main yogic banaati hai
 The class name of these compounds is interstitial compound
 is prakaar ke sabase adhik yogic kshar or kshareey mitti kii dhaatuen, aavart sarini ke visham upavirgo kii dhaatuon ke saath sanyog karke, banaati hai
 The amount of metals in these compounds is reflected by chemical formulas
 in sutron ke adhyayan se gyaat hota he ki is prakaar ke yogic sanyojaktaa ke un sab niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hai jo dhaatu tathaa adhatu ke sanyog se bananevaale yogicon dwaara pratipaadit hue hai
 For example, sodium, tin and lead are chemically reacted to form the following compounds: anek antaradhaatuk yogic bahut sthaayee hote hai or apane galnaank se adhik taap par garam karne se bhi apni avyav dhaatuon main vighatit nahin hote
 These compounds dissolve in liquid ammonia and thus the solution prepared is an electronegative
 jab inkaa vaidyut apghaton kiya jaataa he, tab ek avyav dhaatu, jo duusari kii apeksha nune dhanvidyuti hoti he, dhanagar par jamati he or duusari runagra par
 There is no theoretical explanation as to why interstitial compounds are formed
 keval itnaa hi pratipaadit ho paaya he ki ve dhaatuen, jinke gun ek se hai, ek duusare ke saath sanyog nahin karti hai
 Since these types of alloys are hard, brittle, very less tensile and flexible, only a few of these are useful
 sab mishradhaatuon ko saadharantaya louh tathaa aloh mishradhaatuon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 When iron is the base metal in the alloy, then that iron and when the base metal is any other metal, then it is called non-ferrous alloy

 But for structuralists, this was a very difficult difficulty and for them the depth of experience was only the effect of structures, which could not be an experience by itself
 is sandarbh main san 1959 main derida ne prashnad poocha: kya kisi sanrachana kaa udium nahin hona chahie, tathaa kya arambhikta, yaa udgamam bindu, kisi vastu kaa udgasam hone ke liye pehle se hi sanrachit nahin honi chahie? In other words, every mechanism or synchronous process has a history, and structures cannot be understood without understanding their origin
 saath hi, gati sunishchinat karne ke liye aarmabhikta koi vishuddh ekatv athwa saamanyata nahin ho sakati, balki ise pehle se hi aise paribhaashit hona chahie ki isse ek aitihaasik prakriya kaa udgasam ho sake
 This existential complexity should not be considered a fundamental principle, but rather a lack of origin, what Derida calls iterability, maps, or textuality
 aastitiv-suchak jatilta kaa yah vichaar, na ki aarmabhik shuddhta, udgatmata tathaa sanrachana ke vichaaron ko asantulit karata he tathaa derida ke darshan kaa aadhaar he, jisase virachana sahit is darshan kii sabhi paribhaashayen nikalati hai

 The female reproductive ovary of the flower is transformed by the process of fertilization to produce fruit
 kai padap prajatiyon main, fal ke antargat pakv andashay ke atirikt aasapaas ke utak bhi aate he
 Fruit is the medium through which flowering plants propagate their seeds, although not all seeds come from fruits
 kisi ek paribhaasha dwaara padpon ke falon ke bich main paayi jane vaali baari vividhta kii vyakhya nahin kii ja sakati he
 The term pseudo-fruit is used for fruits like figs or for plant structures that look like fruits but do not originate from flowers or flowers
 kuch anavrutbiji, jaise ki euu ke maansal bijchol fal sadrush hote he jabaki kuch juniparon ke maansal shanku beri jaise dikhte he
 The term fruit also incorrectly refers to the seed-bearing female cones of many coniferous trees
 vanaspatik arth ke kuch vaastavik falon, ko khaanaa pakaane or bhojan taiyaar karne main, sabji, maatr isliye mana jaataa he kyonki ve mithe nahin hote

 kabhi kabhi, lekin bahut kam, ek pakya "fal" vanaspatik arth me ek vaastavik fal nahin hota, udhaaharan ke liye revatcheeni ko aksar ek fal mana jaataa he kyonki iskaa upyog mishthan banane me kiya jaataa he, haalaanki revatcheeni kaa sirf danthal hi khaane yogya hota he
 In the culinary sense, a fruit is usually a vegetable product that has a sweet taste and contains seeds, a vegetable is a faded or less sweet vegetable product and a kernel is a hard oiled and shell vegetable product
 haalanki, giri fal kaa ek prakaar he, yah moongfalee or pista jaise khaadya bijon ke liye ek lokapriy shabd bhi he
 Technically, a single grain of a grain is also a fruit called choriopsis
 However, their fruit wall is very thin and attached to the seed coat, thus almost all edible grain grains are actually a seed
 isliye anaaj ke dane jaise makka, gehun or chaaval ko behatar, khaadya beej mana jaataa he, haalanki kuch sandarbhon me inhen fal mana jaataa he
 The fruit is a mature ovary
 andashay ke andar ek yaa adhik bijand hote hai, jahaan megagamitophite me megagamit yaa and koshikayen hoti he
 The spore is fertilized by a process called pollination, in which pollen particles are transmitted from the stamens of the flowers to the stigma
 paragan ke baad, ek nalika banati he jo vartikagra se andashay ke bijand tak jaati he jahaan paraag se shukranu bijand main sthanantarit hote hai, bijand ke andar shukranu and ke saath judakar ek diploid zaigot kii rachana karte hai
 In flowering plants, the process of fertilization can occur by either plasmogamy where fusion of sperm and egg protoplasm occurs, or cariogamy where the nucleus of sperm and egg meet
 jab shukranu bijand ke nabhik main pravesh kar megagamit or bhrunposh matra koshika ke saath jud jaataa he tab nishechan prakriya puri ho jaati he
 The maturation of the ovaries begins as the developing seed grows
 bijand kaa vikaas beej ke rup main hone lagata he, andashay kii diwaar gaddedaar ban sakati he, yaa yah ek kathor bahari aavaran me viksit ho sakati he
 In some cases, sepals, convulsions and / or stamens and suppositories collapse
 jab tak beej puri tarah paripakv nahin ho jate, fal kaa vikaas jari rahata he
 The growth of pulp in some multiple BG fruits depends on how many spores are fertilized
 fal bhitti, pushp ke andashay kii diwaar se viksit hoti he
 The fruit wall often develops into two or three different layers that can be differentiated into the outer wall, medial wall and the inner wall
 kuch fal main, vishesh rup se saadhaaran fal ek avar andashay se viksit hote hai, pushp ke anya bhaag jaise pushp nalika, dal, bahyadal or punkesar ke andashay ke saath jud kar isi ke saath pakate hai
 The hormone ethylene causes maturation
 jab pushp ke anya bhaag is tarah fal kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa banate hai, tab fal ko sahaayak fal kaha jaataa he
 Because other parts of the flower can contribute to the structure of the fruit, it is important to study the structure of the flower to understand how it develops into a fruit
 falon kii vividhta ke dekhte huye sabhi gyaat falon ke liye kisi ek vargeekaran yojana kaa bananaa bahut kathin he
 Many common words for seeds and fruits are used incorrectly which can make it difficult to understand its terminology
 beej paripakv bijand hai, fal paripakv andashay hai jiname beej shaamil hai
 An explanation can also be added to these two basic definitions that a kernel in botanical terminology is neither a type of a fruit nor a seed, unlike the common terminology
 fal ke teen buniyadi prakaar hai: saadhaaran fal, guchchhedaar fal or bahukhandit fal
 a simple or mixed ovary containing only one stamens produces a simple fruit which may be dry or pulp
 sookhe mewa pakane par yaa sphotak yaa asphotak ho sakate hai
 Examples of dried and common fruits are: Those fruits in which some part of the fruit wall or the entire wall becomes fleshy on the boil are called normal pulp fruits

 An example of this is raspberry
 ek bahukhandit fal, phulon ke ek samooh se gathit hota he

 kuch prajatiyon main, bijaviheenta parthenocarpi kaa parinaam hoti he, jahaan fal bina nishechan prakriya ke hi gathit hota he
 Parthenocarpic fruits are fruits that can be formed even without pollination
 adhikansh bijrahit khattey falon ko paragan prerana kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jabaki kele or annaas ko bilkul nahin
 Changes in the structure of fruits mainly depend on the way their seeds are propagated
 yah prasar pashuon, hawa, pani, yaa visphoti sfooton dwaara praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Fibers, water and vitamin c are usually present in good amount in fruits
