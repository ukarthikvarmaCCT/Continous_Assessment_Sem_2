 Six weeks later, Simone Ross, a reporter for The Guardian, meets with someone to discuss Bourne and Operation Treestone
 bourn paris jaakar mairi ke bhai martin ko bataata he ki vah mar chuki he
 The CIA begins chasing him after Ross mentions "operation Blackbriar" on his cell phone

 Bourne helps Ross escape from the CIA, but he becomes a victim of the Blackbriar killer Paz's bullets, ignoring Bourne's instructions, which was given by Director Noia Vossen of Operation Blackbriar
 chah hafte pehle bourn kii khoj karne main asafal rahane vaali pamela landi ko, ek sisitivi camere main bourn ke dikhaai padane ke baad vosen kii madad karne ke liye bheja jaataa he
 After scrutinizing Ross's notes, he realizes that he got his information from Neil Daniels, CIA station chief in Madrid, and was also actively involved in Blackbriar, having previously been involved in Operation Treestone
 ross ke marane ke baad uske bag kii sahaayta se bourn uske madrid offis pahunchataa he lekin use vahaan koi nahin miltaa
 Bourne annihilates a CIA team sent by Vossen and Landy, and then Nikki Parsons arrives there
 vah bourn kii madad karne kaa faisla karti he or bataati he ki deniells tengeer bhaag gaya he or siie kii ek anya team se bachane main uski sahaayta karti he
 It is shown that he and Parsons had a deep and possibly romantic relationship before Bourne lost his memory
 tengeer pahunchane par parcens deniells kaa pataa lagane kii koshish karti he lekin safal nahin hoti he or use pataa lagata he ki blikebrayar ke "asset" desh buksani ko deniells ko khatam karne kaa kaam saunpa gaya he
 Vossen learns that Parsons has logged in to get Daniels' information and puts Dash behind Parsons and Bourne, though Landy disagrees with the decision
 bourn desh kaa peechha karte hue deniells tak pahunchne main safal ho jaataa he, lekin pehle se lagaaye gaye ek bam se uski maut ko roak nahin paata he
 Before Dash kills Parsons, Bourne kills him in a fierce battle
 uske baad bourn parcens ko chupane ke liye bhej detaa he
 Bourne investigates the contents of Daniels' burnt briefcase in which he finds the address of the highly secretive CIA bureau in New York City from where Vossen is controlling Operation Blackbriar
 bourn neuyork city pahunchataa he; landi ko bourn kaa ek phone kol miltaa he jise vosen ne pehle se hi tap kiya hua he
 Landy thanked him for a tape sent to him by Bourne, showing the black misdeeds of Ward Abbott, former Director of Treestone; She tells him that her real name is David Webb and that her date of birth is 4 / 15 / 71
 landi se baat karte samay bourn ne dekha ki vosen atyant vargeekrut saamagree ko apane offis ke ek sef main rakh rahaa he
 Bourne told Landy that you "get some rest" because you looked "tired", both Vossen and Landy understood that this meant Bourne was watching them
 vosen ne bourn dwaara landi ko bheje gaye ek text sandesh ko pard liya jisame bourn ne milane ke ek sthaan kaa zikr kiya tha
 Vossen then left his office with a team to capture Bourne
 bourn ne vosen ke offis main ghuskar vargeekrut blikebrayar dastavejon ko chura liya
 Vossen puts Paz behind Bourne, the two eventually face off in a car chase, in which Paz forces Bourne to hit the police car he stole with a stone divider
 bourn ne baahar nikalakar apni bandook ko paaz ke upar taan diya lekin phir use chhod diya or 415 east 71st street main aage bad gaya, jiskaa pataa landi dwaara bataai gayi uski galat janmatithi se use mila tha
 Vossen also understood Landy's code and warned Albert Hirsch, the doctor who runs Treestone's Behavior Modification Program, that Bourne was coming
 building pahunchne par landi kii mulaakaat bourn se hoti he jahaan bourn usko blikebrayar kii filein dene ke baad andar chalaa jaataa he
 Landy faxes those files to an unknown receiver and Vossen discovers this after the last page has been successfully sent

 He then states that he is no longer Jason Bourne and goes to the roof to escape a CIA team that followed
 chat par uskaa saamana paaz se hota he jo usase poochta he ki usne use jinda kyon chhod diya
 Bourne asks Paz if he even knows why he has been sent to kill him and repeats the last words of a deadstone assassin he killed: "look at us
 Look at what they're asking of you
" " paaz apni bandook neeche kar letaa he or bourn chat se neeche east river main kudane ke liye daudta he, lekin usee samay vosen aa jaataa he or bourn par goli chalaa detaa he
 Sometime later, Parsons is shown watching a TV news disclosing Operation Blackbriar; It also mentions the arrests of Hirsch and Vossen, and the criminal investigation of CIA director Ezra Kramer; And it is also reported that David Webb is reportedly shot and has fallen in the East River
 yah sunakar ki teen din tak khojane ke baad bhi uskaa sharir nahin mila, parcens muskaraati he; girane ke baad bourn ko pani ke andar tairte hue dikhaaya jaataa he

 Like the earlier film The Bourne Supremacy, it has also faced criticism for its excessive use of the "shakey camera"; As Time magazine's Richard Corliss writes in his otherwise positive review, "why does it feel like the camera is suffering from Parkinson's when the dialogue scenes are seen? The frame of the film feels like a shiver and the speaker hides the listener's shoulder, This makes the audience quite irritable and divert their attention from the scene
 " The British press has commented on the inclusion of a fictional journalist from the original British newspaper 'the Guardian' and the scenes filmed in the UK

 anaphilaxis ek gambhir alergic riection he jo achaanak armbh hota he or yah sharir kii anek pranaaliyon ko prabhavit karata he
 It is caused by the secretion of cytokines from inflammatory factors and mast cells and basophils
 unka srav visheshkar pratirakshan pranali riection ke kaaran hota he parantu in koshikaon ke kshatigrast hone ke kaaran ho saktaa he jo pratiraksha pranali se sambandhit nahin hai
 When anaphylaxis is caused by an immune response, immunoglobin e combines with an external substance that initiates an allergic reaction
 ige kaa sangyojan mast koshikaon or basophills par grahi fcεri pratirakshi sakriyata se judaa hota he
 Mast cells and basophils react by secreting inflammatory factors such as histamine
 ye kaarak bronchioli kii komal peshiyon main sankuchan paidaa karte hai, raktavahiniyon ko chaudaa kar dete hai, rakt vahikaaon se drav ke srav ko badha dete hai or hriday peshiyon kii kriya ko kam kar dete hai
 There is also an immune system that does not depend on ige, but it is not known whether it also occurs in humans
 anaphilaxis jab pratirakshi pranali kii pratikriya ke kaaran nahin hota he, to riection kaa kaaran vah agent hota he jo sidhe mast koshikaon or basophil ko nasht kar detaa he, jiske kaaran histamin or anya padaarthon kaa srav hota he jo praaia: allergic riection se jude hote hai 
 Factors that can damage these cells include contrast factors for x-rays, opioids, temperature, and vibration
 anaphilaxis rog kii pahchaan naidanik tathyon ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 When any one of the following three conditions occur within minutes / hours of exposure to an allergenic substance, it is highly likely that the person has anaphylaxis: agar keet ke dank maarane yaa dawa se kisi vyakti par vifailli pratikriya hoti he to anaphilaxis rog kii pahchaan karne main tryptes yaa histamine ke liye khun kii jaanch karnaa upyogi ho saktaa he
 However, these tests are not very useful if they are due to food or if the person's blood pressure is normal and they cannot rule out the possibility of identifying anaphylaxis disease
 anaphilaxis kii teen pramukh visheshtaayen hoti hai
 Anaphylactic shock occurs when the blood vessels in most parts of the entire body become enlarged, causing the blood pressure to fall which is at least 30% lower than a person's normal blood pressure, or 30% below the standard value
 bafesic anaphilaxis kii pahchaan tab hoti he jab iske lakshan 1-72 ghanton ke bheetar phir se dikhne lagen, bhale hi vyakti allergy karne vaale tatwon ke saath nae sampark main na aayaa ho, jinke kaaran pehali baar pratikriya hui thi
 Some studies claim that 20% of total cases of anaphylaxis are biphasic
 lakshanon kii vaapasi aam taur par 8 ghanton ke bheetar hoti he
 Treatment of the second reaction is similar to that of the original anaphylaxis
 sudo-anophlaksis yaa anophelactoid pratikriyaayein us anaphilaxis ke puraane naam hai jo allergy vaali pratikriya ke kaaran nahin balki mastul koshikaon par sidhi chot ke kaaran hota he
 The nickname used by the World Allergy Organization is "non-immune anaphylaxis"
 kuch log is baat ki sifarish karte hai ki puraane naam kaa upyog ab nahin kiya janaa chahie
 An allergy test can be helpful in determining what causes a person to have anaphylaxis
 twachaa allergy jaanch kuch nishchit khadyon or jeev-vishon ke liye uplabdh he
 Blood tests for specific disease antibodies may be useful to confirm allergies related to milk, eggs, peanuts, nuts and fish
 twachaa kii jaanchon se pencilin allergiyon kii pushti ho sakati hai lekin, anya aushadhiyon ke liye twachaa sambandhi koi jaanch nahin he
 Non-immune forms of anaphylaxis can only be identified by investigating a person's history or by exposing the person to allergens that have caused them to react in the past
 non-immune anaphilaxis ke liye twachaa yaa rakt sambandhi koi jaanch nahin he
 Sometimes anaphylaxis is difficult to distinguish separately from asthma, due to lack of oxygen, and from fear of accident
 asthma se peedit logon main aam taur par khujali yaa pet athwa aant sambandhi lakshan nahin hote hai
 When a person becomes unconscious, the skin becomes pale but, it does not have rash
 aakasmik bhay se grast vyakti kii twachaa laal ho sakati he lekin, usamen chakatte nahin hote hai
 Other conditions that may have similar symptoms include food poisoning caused by spoiled fish and infections with some parasites
 jin kaarnon se ateet main pratikriya hui ho unase parhez karnaa, anaphilaxis kii rokthaam kaa anushansit tarika he
 When this is not possible, there are also treatments that can prevent the body from reacting to any known ingredient that is allergic
 madhumakhiyon, tataiyon, lakheriyon, yelogacketon or fire ant se hone vaali allergiyon ke liye hymenoptera vishon ke dwaara immune system yani pratiraksha pranali kaa upachaar prabhavi hota he jisase 80-90% vayaskon or 98% bacchon main samvedanheenata prabhavi rahi he
 In the case of certain foods, including milk, eggs, nuts and peanuts, immune treatment from the mouth may be effective in sensitizing some people; However such treatments often cause side effects
 samvedanheenata, kai dawaaon ke liye bhi sambhav he, iske baavjood zyaadaatar logon ko keval samasya paidaa karne vaali aushadhiyon se parhez karnaa chahie
 Individuals who respond to latex would be better off avoiding foods that contain ingredients that cause an immune response in them, including avocado, bananas, and potatoes, among others
 anaphilaxis ek prakaar kii chikitsiya apaat sthiti he jisamen shwasan-maarg prabandhan, poorak oxigen, nason ke madhyam se die jane vaale taral padaarthon kii badi maatra or gahan nigaraanee jaise jivan rakshak upayon kii aavashyaktaa pad sakati he
 Epinephrine is a treatment option
 ipinefrine ke atirikt aksar antihistamins or steroid kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 When individuals are in a normal state, they should be monitored for 2 to 24 hours in the hospital to ensure that symptoms do not recur because this can happen again if the person has biphasic anaphylaxis
 ipinefrine anaphilaxis ke liye praathmik upachaar he
 There is no reason not to use it
 is baat kii sifarish kii jaati he ki jaise hi anaphilaxis kii sandigdh sthiti kii pahchaan ho, madhya agraparshvik jaangh main ipinefrine taral kaa injection diya jaae
 This injection is repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if the person does not respond better to treatment
 16 se 35% maamalon main duusari khuraaq kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 More than two doses are required in very rare cases
 twachaa ke neeche die jane vaale injection ke mukaable nason main die jane vaale injection ko praathamikta di jaati he jisamen, dawa ko atyant dhimi gati se avashoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Minor problems with epinephrine include tremors, restlessness, headaches, and numbness
 ipinefrine aise logon par prabhavi nahin hoti he jo bi-bloker lete hai
 In this situation, glucagon may be given intravenously if epinephrine is not effective
 glucagon main aisi kaary pranali he jisamen β-abhigraahak shaamil nahin hote hai
 If necessary, epinephrine can also be given intravenously using dilute liquid
 halanki, intravenus ipinefrine ko dil kii aniyamit dhadakanon or hrydayaghaton se joda gaya he
 The epinephrine auto-injector, which facilitates individuals with anaphylaxis to inject epinephrine on their own in the veins, is generally available in two doses, one 25 kg
 One for adults or children overweight and the other for children whose weight is 10 to 25 kg
 Be between ipinefrine ke atirikt antihistamine kaa upyog saamaanya rup se hota he
 They were considered to be effective on theoretical arguments, but there is little evidence that antihistamine is indeed effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis
 2007 cokeren samiksha main acchhee gunvattta vaala aisa koi bhi adhyayan nahin paaya gaya jise isaki sifarish ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 No antihistamine effects on fluid formation or spasms in the respiratory tract have been observed
 agar vyakti ko vartmaan samay main anaphilaxis ho to corticosteroidon se koi antar hone kii sambhaavna behad kam he
 It can be used in the hope that the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis is reduced but its efficacy in preventing future anaphylaxis is uncertain
 jab shwasni-aakarsh lakshanon main ipinefrine raahat nahin detaa he to saans ke madhyam se dawa lenevaale upkaran kii sahaayta se diya jane vaala salbutamol prabhavi ho saktaa he
 Methylene blue is used for individuals who do not react to other measures because it can relax the soft nerves
 jin logon ko anaphilaxis kaa khatra ho unhen “allergy ection plan” kaa paalan karne kii salaah di jaati he
 Regarding the problem of children's allergies, their parents should inform the school about it and also what should be done in an anaphylotic emergency
 ection plan main aam taur par ipinefrine auto-injectoron ke istemaal, chikitsiya alert vaale bracelate pahanane kii salaah or aisi paristhitiyon ko paidaa karne vaale prerakon se parhez ke bare main paraamarsh shaamil hota he
 Treatment is available to make the body less sensitive to an allergic reaction to the motivators causing certain conditions

 ] The carbon dioxide from the air reacts with the alkali in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the ph
 Carbon dioxide will start to carbonate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made
 This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete
 If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide of the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete
 When designing a concrete structure, it is normal to state the concrete cover for the rebar
 The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes
 If the reinforcement is too close to the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur
 One method of testing a structure for carbonatation is to drill a fresh hole in the surface and then treat the surface with phenolphthalein
 This will turn when in contact with alkaline cement, making it possible to see the depth of carbonatation
 An existing hole is no good because the exposed surface will already be carbonated---> ] This phenomenon has been popularly referred to as "concrete cancer"

 Gandhism is said to be a collection of ideas derived from the ideals, beliefs and philosophies of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was one of the greatest political and spiritual leaders of the freedom struggle
 yah aise un sabhi vichaaron kaa ek samekit rup he jo gandhiji ne jivan paryant jiya evam kiya tha
 When a person or institution is addressed as a Gandhian, it means one is adhering to the values and ideals established by Gandhiji
 satya evam aagrah dono hi sanskrit bhashaa ke shabd hai, jo bhartiya swadhinata sangram ke dauraan prachlit hua tha, jiskaa arth hota he satya ke prati satya ke madhyam se agrahi hona
 Gandhiji said, "I have nothing new to teach the world
" satya evam ahimsa to duniya main utane hi puraane hai jitne hamaare parvat hai
 Truth is paramount among the basic elements of Gandhism; And truth should be the pivot of any political institution, social institution etc
 ve apane kisi bhi rajnatik nirnay ko lene se pehle sachai ke siddhanto kaa paripaalan avashya karte the
 His loyalty to truth, non-violence, human freedom, equality and justice can be best understood from examples of his personal life
 kaha jaataa he ki satya kii vyakhya aksar vastunishth nahin hoti
 According to Gandhism, the observance of truth has not been suggested to be a spiritual truth
 yadi koi eemaandareepurvak maanata he ki ahimsa aavashyak he to use satya kii raksha ke rup main sweekaar karnaa chahie
 When Gandhiji returned home during the First World War, he said that he probably did not believe in participating in the war on behalf of the British
 gandhiji ke anusaar british samrajya kaa hissaa hote hue bharatiyon ke liye samaan adhikaar kii maang karnaa or samrajya kii suraksha main apni bhagidaari na nibhaana uchit nahin hota
 On the other hand, when Japan reached near India's border at the time of the Second World War, Gandhiji did not consider it appropriate to participate in the war, but instead advocated resorting to non-violence

 satya bolnaa, chori nahin karnaa, pardu:khakaatarata, dusron kii sahaayta karnaa aadi yahi sabhi dharm sikhaate hai 
 Only by adopting these values, politics can be done with service
 gandhi ji aadambar or karmkand ko dharm nahi maanate or jor dekar kehete hai ki mandir me baithe bhagwaan mere ram nahi he 
 Adopting the concept of Swami Vivekananda Ji's impoverished Narayan, he considers human service as the true religion

 He wrote in his letter Harijan on 6 October 1946 about the partition of India: jaisaa ki muslim lig dwaara rakhi gayi he purna rup se gaiyr-islamic he evam mujhe ise paapapurna kehete hue bhi koi sankoch nahin
 Islam has been in favor of brotherhood and unity of the whole of humanity, so those who want to form groups of fighting in India by splitting India are truly enemies of not only India but also Islam

 When Dara saw that his chariots would become useless on high ground, he ordered the horsemen of the left arm to attack and stop Alexander's right arm

 According to the Puranas, fifty-two Shaktipeeths were constructed from various parts of the body of Sati
 iske peeche yah antarktha he ki daksh prajapati ne kankhal main 'brihaspati sarv' naamak yajna rachaaya
 Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and other deities were invited to that yagna, but did not deliberately call their gathering Lord Shankar
 shankaraji kii patni or daksh kii putree sati pita dwaara na bulaae jane par or shankaraji ke rokane par bhi yajna main bhaag lene gayi
 At the place of sacrifice, Sati asked her father Daksha the reason for not inviting Shankar ji and expressed fierce opposition to her father
 is par daksh prajapati ne bhagwaan shankar ko apshabd kahe
 Suffering from this insult, Sati jumped into the yagna-agni Kund and gave her life
 bhagwaan shankar ko jab is durghatana kaa pataa chalaa to krodh se unka teesraa netra khul gaya
 On the orders of Lord Shankar, all the gods, who were frightened by the fierce anger of his people, ran away from the sacrificial fire
 bhagwaan shankar ne yajyakund se sati ke parthiv sharir ko nikaal kandhe par uthaa liya or duhkhi hue idhar-udhar ghoomane lage
 Subsequently, Lord Vishnu, the follower of the world, cut Sati's body from the cycle to save the whole world from the Holocaust

 sati ne duusare janm main himalayaputree parvati ke rup main shankar ji se vivaah kiya
