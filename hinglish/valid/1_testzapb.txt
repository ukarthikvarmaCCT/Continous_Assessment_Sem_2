 un maamalon main jahaan ek pariyojna jisaki shuruuaati nivesh duusari parsparik vishisht pariyojna se zyada hoti he
 The IRR of the first project may be low but its NPV may be high and hence it should be adopted in lieu of the second project pariyojna ke dauraan IRR sakaaratmak nakadi pravaah kii khapat karne kii sochataa he
 If positive capital flows can invest back into the project, then a suitable reinvestment rate will be required which will calculate reinvestment capital flows and hence IRR is reinvested with capital flows
 jab gananaa kii hui IRR, antarim nakad pravaah ke liye vaastavik punarnivesh dar se alag hoti he tab vaarshik samakaksh pratifal ke aankalan ko bilkul sateekta ke saath pratibimbit karegacompany le paas atirikt pariyojnaayen ho sakati hai jo ki antarim nakad pravaah ke nivesh ke liye bilkul utani hi aakarshak apekshaaon vaali ho sakati hai This makes IIR suitable for venture capital valuation and other private equity investments
 is tarah kii ranneetiyon ko aamtaur par puri pariyojna ke dauraan bahut se nakadi nivesh kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 But in the end it sees only one cash outflow chunki IRR puunji kii laagat par vichaar nahin karata he, iskaa prayog alag-alag avadhiyon vaali pariyojnaon kii tulana ke liye nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The revised internal return rate considers the cost of capital and gives a better indication of a project's ability to contribute to the firm's discounted cash flow
 sakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke maamle main jiske peeche nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah chalata rahata he, iiar kaa ekaadhik maan ho saktaa he
 In this case , a discount rate can be used to quote cash flow and IRR calculations can be used for investment cash flow
 yah udhaaharan tab lagu hota he jab ek graahak vishisht mashin ke banane se pehle raashi jamaa karwaata he
 In a series of cash flows, such as an initially invested amount of money, a higher rate of return is best, but is then owned by more than one person
 isliye ek kisi or kii dhan raashi kaa rini hota he, isliye ab kam dar vaale pratifal sabase achche hai
 In this case it is not clear whether more IRR is better or less IRR
 a project can have multiple irrs, as in example 0% and 10%
 is tarah kii pariyojnaon kaa udahaaran khand khan or parmaanu bijli sanyantr hai, jahaan aamtaur par pariyojna ke ant main bahut zyada nakadi bahirpravaah hoti he In general, IRR can be calculated by solving a polynomial criterion
 yadi sameekaran kaa koi vaastaviktaa main adwitiya samaadhaan he to starm sutara kaa prayog tab kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally, the solution of the IRR equation cannot be found in an analytical way but it can be solved by iterative method
 jab kisi pariyojna kii kai IRR hoti hai to uske punarnivesh ke laabh ke saath us pariyojna kii gananaa karnaa or bhi zyada aasaan ho sakati he em ai aar aar ke anusaar, jiskaa punarnivesh dar anumaanit hota he, aam taur par yah dar pariyojna kii laagat ke baraabar hota he
 Despite the strong academic choice of NPV, surveys indicate that authorities place more importance on IRR than NPV
 aam taur par, prabandhakon ko alag-alag tarah ke aakaaron ke niveshon kii tulana karnaa aasaan lagata he, agar ye tulana en pi ve ke dollaron se pratifal dar ke pratishat ke bare main ho to
 halaanki, vyapaar ke mulya kii drushti se dekhen to en pi ve phir bhi "adhik sateek" he
 As a measure of investment efficiency, the IRR has better insight into situations such as capital control
 haalaanki, jab parsparik rup se vishisht pariyojnaon kii tulana kii jaati he to en pi ve uchit upaay he
 Mathematical investment value has to pass through some rate of return, according to mathematics the value of investment is used to estimate exponential growth or decay according to some rate of return
 This estimate operates with cash flow impropriety and defines the IRR of a series of cash flows as any return rate that results in zero net present value
 is prakaar aantarik dar yaa daren pratifal dar ke kaary ke rup main shuddh vartmaan mulya kaa anusaran karti hai
 This process is continuous
 -100% shuddh vartmaan mulya ke pratifal dar kii ore chalem to, shuddh vartmaan mulya pichley nakadi pravaah ke chinh ke saath anant kii ore aage badhata he or pratifal dar kaa sakaaratmak anant, shuddh vartmaan mulya pratham nakadi pravaah kii ore bad jaataa he 
 isliye, yadi pehali or aakhri nakadi pravaah ke alag-alag chinh hai to vahaan par aatanrik pratifal dar maujuud he
 Example of time series without IRR: sakaaratmak shrinkhalaaon ke baad vishesh rup se nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke maamle main nakadi pravaah kaa kul mulya sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak nakadi pravaah ke bich main samay ke rup main parivartit hota he
 The results of the return rate function, positive and negative, are constant from infinity and in a similar way, so there is a unique rate of return, for which it is zero, so the IRR is also unique
 haalanki iske puure prakshetra main ye zaruri nahin he ki NPV bhi ek saamaan tareeke se kam hota rahe aisa IRR par hota he Similarly, IRR is also unique, especially in terms of positive cash flow and especially negative cash flow

 madhumehi neuropathy madhumeh melitas se judaa ek neuropathic vikaar he
 The assumption about this disorder is that it is a result of diabetic microvascular damage involving small blood vessels that supply to the veins in addition to macrovascular states that may eventually lead to diabetic neuropathy
 madhumehi neuropathy se sambandhit apekshaakrit saamaanya avasthaaon main third nerve palsi; mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; madhumehi amyotrophy; ek dardanaak polineuropathy; autonomik neuropathy; or thoracoebdominal neuropathy shaamil hai
 Diabetic neuropathy affects all peripheral nerves: painful fibers, motor neurons, autonomic nerves
 isliye yah aavashyak rup se sabhi angon or tantron ko prabhavit kar saktaa he kyonki sabhi aapas main tantrikaon ke madhyam se jude hote hai
 There are many obvious syndromes depending on the organ systems and members affected, but they are not exclusive
 ek rogi main sensorimotor or autonomik neuropathy yaa koi anya sangyojan ho saktaa he
 Symptoms vary depending on the affected nerves and may include symptoms other than those listed
 aam taur par lakshanon kaa vikaas saal dar saal dhire-dhire hota he
 Symptoms may include: aisi dharna he ki madhumehi neuropathy ke vikaas main chaar kaarak shaamil hai: Vascular and nervous diseases have a very deep and close relationship
 rakt vahiniyaan saamaanya tantrika kaary par nirbhar karti hai or tantrikaayen paryaapt rakt pravaah par nirbhar karti hai
 The first pathological change in microvasculature is vasoconstriction
 jaise-jaise is rog main pragati hoti he vaise-vaise sanvahneey asaamanyataon ke vikaas ke saath neuronal disfunction kaa aapasi sambandh gaharaata jaataa he jaise capilri basament membrane kaa motaa hona or andothelial hyperplasia jo kam oxigen tanaav or hypoxia main yogadan karata he
 Neuronal ischemia is a well-known feature of diabetic neuropathy
 vaisodilator agenton ke falswaroop neuronal rakt pravaah main paryaapt sudhaar ho saktaa he or uske anusaar tantrika chaalan veg main sudhaar ho saktaa he
 Thus, microvascular dysfunction accompanies the progression of neural dysfunction in the early stages of diabetes and may be sufficient to support the severity of structural, functional and clinical changes seen in diabetic neuropathy
 glucose ke oonche antarkoshikeey staron kii vajah se proteinon ke saath gaiyr-injim sambandhi sahasanyojak bandhan kaa parinaam dekhne ko miltaa he jo unki sanrachana ko badal detaa he or unke kaary main baadha daalata he
 Some of these glycosylated proteins are involved in the pathology of diabetic neuropathy and other long-term complications of diabetes
 pikisi madhumehi neuropathy kii pathology main shaamil he
 An increase in glucose levels results in an increase in intracellular diacylglycerol that activates PKC
 pashu modelon main pikisi pravrodhak neuronal rakt pravaah main vruddhi karke tantrika chaalan veg main vruddhi karegaa
 The polyol pathway, also known as the sorbitol / aldose reductase pathway, may be involved in diabetic complications resulting in microvascular damage to nerve tissue and also to the retina and kidney
 glucose ek ucch pratikriyasheel yogic he or chayapachay kriya dwaara ise parivartit karnaa aavashyak he yaa ise pratikriya karne ke liye sharir main maujuud utak mil jaaenge
 madhumeh ke kshetra main dekhe jane vaale maamalon kii tarah glucose kaa badha hua str is jaev rasinic maarg ko sakriy kar detaa he jisaki vajah se glutathian main kami or pratikriyasheel oxigen radicals main vruddhi kaa parinaam dekhne ko miltaa he
 This pathway depends on the enzyme aldose reductase
 is anzime ke pravrodhak neuropathy ke vikaas ko rokane main pashu modelon main prabhavakaari sabit hue hai
 While most physiological cells require the action of insulin for glucose to enter the cell, the cells of the retina, kidney, and nervous tissues do not depend on insulin
 isliye aankh, kidney or neurons main insulin kii kriya kii parvaah kiye bina koshika ke bhitari bhaag se bahari bhaag tak glucose kaa ek mukt vinimay hota he
 Cells will normally use glucose for energy and glucose not used for energy will enter the polyol pathway and turn into sorbitol
 Under normal blood sugar levels this exchange would not cause any problems because the aldose reductase has little similarity to glucose or sugars at normal concentrations
 haalanki, hyperglaichemic avasthaa main glucose ke liye eldose ridctes kii samanta main vruddhi hoti he jiskaa matlab he ki sorbetol kaa str kaaphi bad jaataa he or enedipiech kaa str kaaphi ghat jaataa he jo ek aisa yogic he jiskaa istemaal us samay kiya jaataa he jab yah maarg sakriy ho jaataa he
 Sorbitol cannot cross cell membranes and when it is collected, it draws osmotic pressure on the cells by drawing water into the cell
 fructose multah ek hi kaam karata he or iskaa nirmaan or aage rasinic maarg main hota he
 The NADPH used during the passage is activated to promote nitric oxide and glutathian production, and its conversion to the pathway results in reactive oxygen molecules
 glutathian kii kami se oxidative dabaav kii vajah se hemolysis kaa parinaam dekhne ko mil saktaa he or hamen pehle se hi maaloom he ki nitric oxide rakt vahikaaon kaa ek mahatvapurn vaisodilator he
 NAD +, also used, is essential to keep reactive oxygen species apart from forming and destroying cells
 iske alaava, aisa vishwaas he ki sorbetol kaa ooncha str nas kii kriyasheeltaa ke liye aavashyak plasma jhilli Na+ / K+ atpase pump kii gatividhi ko kam karke ek anya alcohol, myoincetol ke koshikeey udgrahan ko kam karata he jo aage chalakar neuropathy main yogadan karata he
 In short, excessive activation of the polyol pathway results in increased levels of sorbitol and reactive oxygen molecules, and decreases nitric oxide and glutathian levels, as well as increased osmotic pressure on the cell membrane
 inamen se koi bhi ek tatv koshika kshati ko badhaava de saktaa he lekin yahan ham kai tatwon ko ekasaath sakriy rup main dekhte hai
 Different nerves or nerves are affected differently choti tantrika tantuon kii tulana main badi tantrika tantuon par bahut zyada prabhaav padataa he kyonki tantrika kii lambaai ke anupaat main tantrika chaalan veg dhimaa ho jaataa he
 In this syndrome, the loss of sensation of sensation and loss of change is first seen in each toe, then it is expanded upwards
 ise aam taur par sunnata, samvedan haani, apsamvedan or ratrikalin dard ke haath se pair tak vitaran ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 This pain can be felt like burning, pricking sensation, painful or lethargy

 The loss of proprioception first has an effect, which is a feeling where it feels as if the organ is swinging in space
 These patients do not even realize when they are stepping on an external object such as a splinter or concealment, or their feet are aching due to shoes that do not fit properly
 natijatan, unke paanv or pairon main sankraman or ulcer hone kaa khatra rahata he jisase aage chalakar pair kaatna bhi pad saktaa he
 Similarly, these patients may also fracture several times in the knee, ankle or foot and develop a charcoal joint
 motor function kii haani kii vajah se dorsiflection, pair kii anguliyon kaa avkunchan, interosius mansapeshi kriyasheeltaa kii haani kaa parinaam dekhnaa padataa he or iske falswaroop ankon kaa sankuchan hota he jise haimer tose kehete hai
 These contractions occur not only in the feet but also in the hands, where the loss of musculature causes the hands to appear like guts and skeletons
 mansapeshiyon kii kriyasheeltaa kii haani pragatisheel prakruti kii hoti he
 The autonomic nervous system, or autonomic nervous system, is formed from the nerves serving the heart, the gastrointestinal system, and the genitourinary system
 autonomik neuropathy inamen se kisi bhi ang tantra ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 The most commonly recognized autonomic dysfunction in diabetic is orthostatic hypotension or unconsciousness during standing
 madhumehi autonomik neuropathy ke maamle main aisa mastishk tak rakt ke lagaataar or puri tarah se behate rahane ke liye hriday gati or vascular tone ko sahi tarah se samyojit karne main hriday or dhamniyon ke vifal hone kii vajah se hota he
 This symptom is usually accompanied by the loss of normal changes in heart rate seen with normal breathing
 in donon nishkarshon se autonomik neuropathy kaa pataa chalata he
 GI tract manifestations include gastroparesis, nausea, bloating, and diarrhea or diarrhea
 chunki kai madhumehi apane madhumeh ke liye maukhik dawa lete hai, isliye in dawaaon ke avasorana par vilamb gastric riktata kaa bahut zyada asar padataa he
 As a result, hypoglycemia may have to be seen when an oral anti-diabetic agent is taken before a meal and is not absorbed for several hours or sometimes even several days when there is already normal or low blood sugar or sugar
 Sluggish movement of the small intestine may result in bacterial overgrowth which may be aggravated by the presence of hyperglycemia
 iske falswaroop sujan, gas or diaria yaa dast kaa parinaam bhugatna padataa he
 Urinary symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence and blockage
 phir se, mutr ke avarodhan kii vajah se aksar mutr maarg sankraman hota he
 Bladder diverticula, stone, reflux nephropathy may suffer as a result of urinary obstruction
 jab kapaal tantrika prabhavit hote hai tab okulomotor neuropathy sabase aam hote hai
 The oculomotor nerve controls all muscles that agitate the eye with the exception of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles
 yah putali ko sankuchit karne or palak ko kholane kaa bhi kaam karti he
 Diabetic third nerve paralysis attacks are usually sudden, starting with frontal and periorbital pain and then diplopia
 tritiy tantrika dwaara vitarit sabhi okulomotor mansapeshiyaan prabhavit ho sakati hai lekin putali ke aakaar ko niyantrit karne vaali mansapeshiyaan aam taur par pehle se hi acchhee tarah se sangrakshit hoti hai
 This is because parasympathetic nerves within CNIII that affect pupil size are found at the periphery of the nerve, making them less susceptible to ischemic damage
 a sixth nerve called the esophagus nerve that distributes the lateral rectus muscle of the eye is also commonly affected, but the presence of a fourth nerve called the pulmonary nerve is uncommon
 vaksh yaa qamar kii ridh kii tantrikaon kii mononeuropathy ho sakati he or iske falswaroop dardanaak syndrome kii utpatti ho sakati he jo myocardial infarction, cholesistitis yaa apendicitis ke sadrush hote hai
 In diabetic or diabetic patients, the incidence of entrapment neuropathy is very high, such as carpal tunnel syndrome

 a general result of company testing or monofilament suggests a low probability of developing large fibrous peripheral neuropathy of diabetes
 sanketon ke sangyojan in 2 vyaktigat nishkarshon se behatar pradarshan nahin karte hai
 Nerve conduction tests may indicate reduced functioning of peripheral nerves, but they are rarely associated with severity of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and are not suitable as routine tests for this condition or condition
 neuropathy ke chayapachay kaarnon kii samaj main unnati ke baavjood in pathological prakriyaaon ko baadhit karne ke uddeshy se kiye jane vaale upachaar simit hai
 Thus, with the exception of tight glucose control, treatment is performed to reduce pain and other symptoms
 dard niyantran ke vikalpon main triciclic antedepressnts, serotonin reupatek inhibitors or antiepileptic drugs shaamil hai
 a systematic review concluded that "tricyclic antidepressants and conventional anticonvulsants are superior to new-generation anticonvulsants for short-term pain
" " in dawaaon kaa sangyojan bhi ek ekal agent ke liye behatar sabit ho saktaa he

 The Jataka or Jataka Pali or Jataka stories are the 10th part of the Khuddakanikaya under the Sutpitaka of the Buddhist scripture Tripitaka

 Which is believed to have been told by Gautam Buddha himself, although some scholars believe that some Jataka stories have been told by his disciples after Gautam Buddha

 This is an event dating back 300 years

 The Jataka is the tenth famous text of the Khadak body
 jataka ko vastutah granth na kahkar granth samooh hi kahana adhik upyukt hoga
 Some of his plot is in the form of a complete book and sometimes his stories are in the form of brief epics

 It means past or emotion

 When metal is used in the ghost sense, when the meaning is done, then the story and form are created

 God Buddha is called Bodhisattva before he attains enlightenment

 They sacrifice their lives many times for the sake of spirituality

 The word Bodhisattva itself means industrial beings for Bodhi
 bodhi ke liye he satv jiskaa aisa arth bhi kuch vidwaanon ne kiya he
 In the Pali Sutras, we read many times, "before attaining enlightenment, at the time of not being Buddha, when i was a Bodhisattva", etc
 atah bodhisattva se spasht taatpary gyaan, satya dayaa aadi kaa abhyaas karne vaale us sadhak se he jiskaa aage chalakar buddha hona nishchit he
 Lord Buddha had not only been a Bodhisattva in his last birth before the state of enlightenment, but he also followed the Bodhisattva practice in many of his earlier births
 jataka kii kathaayen bhagavan buddha ke in vibhinn purvajanmon se jabaki ve bodhisattva rahe the, sambandhit hai
 He is portrayed as the protagonist in most stories

 Some of the Jataka stories have been named from the first words of the saga that came in the Jataka, namely - Apataka Jataka; According to one's protagonist, vānupath jātaka; According to the births of the Bodhisattva, such as Nigradh Mig Jataka, Machta Jataka, etc
 sabhi jataka kathaayen gautamabuddha ke dwaara kahi gayi he, jataka buddha samaykalin he, jaatakon kii nishchit sankhya kitni he, iskaa nirnay karnaa bada kathin he
 According to the custom prevalent in Lanka, Burma and Siam, the Jataka are 550

 '' Panasa Dhakani Panchasatani Jatakanti Veditabb
 ‘‘ atthasalini kii nidaan katha main bhi -pannasadhikani panchajatakasatani‘‘ he
 The number is broadly fixed
 jataka ke vartmaan rup main 547 jataka kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 But this number is also only upper
 jatakatthawannanakaar ne vishaywastu kii drushti se inhen paanch virgon main vibhajit kiya he- Many of the Jataka stories are also found in two places with little variation or have been embedded in each other, and likewise many Jataka stories are found in sutta-pitaka, vinaya-pitaka, and other Pali texts, but In the present form of Jataka is not stored
 atah jaatakon kii sankhya main kaaphi kami kii bhi or briddhi kii bhi sambhaavna he
 For example, the story of Munik Jataka and Saluk Jataka is same, but only two names have come from different places
 iske vipareet ‘munik jataka’ naam ke do jataka hote hue unki bhi katha bhinn-bhinn he
 This is also the case for two people named Machh Jataka
 kahi-kahin do swatantra jaatakon ko milakar ek tisare jataka kaa nirmaan kar diya gaya he
 For example, both the Panchapandit Jataka and the Dakarakkhas Jataka are inhabited by the Maha Ummag Jataka
 jo kathaayen jataka-katha ke rup main anyatra pai jaati hai, kintu ‘jataka’ main sangruhit nahin he, unka bhi kuch ullekh kar dena aavashyak hoga
 The Ghatikar of the Majjhim body- Sutta or Ghatikar Sutta is one such Jataka story which is not found in 'jataka'
 isi prakaar dirghanikaay kaa mahagovind sutt jo swayan jataka kii nidaan katha main bhi ‘mahagovind jataka’ ke naam se nirdisht hua he, jataka ke andar nahin paaya jaataa he
 Similarly, in Dhammapadatthakatha and Milind Panha, some such Jataka-stories are quoted, which are not stored in Jataka
 atah kuch jataka nishchit rup se kitne he iskaa thik nirnay nahin ho saktaa
 When we consider the number of the Jataka, the Jataka means a story with a special title, which describes the life-related event of the Bodhisattva, no matter how many different stories are interwoven in that one
 Are given
 yadi kul kahaniyaan gini jaay to jataka main kareeb teen hajaar kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 The Jatakas have in fact been compiled on the basis of sutta-pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 sutt -pitak main anek aisi kathaayen he jinka upyog vahaan upadesh dene ke liye kiya gaya he
 But the Bodhisattva is not mentioned in it
 yah kaam baad main karke prayek kahani ko jataka kaa rup de diya gaya he
 Tittir Jataka and Dighit Kosal Jataka are similarly constructed from Chullavagg and Mahavagga respectively of vinaya-pitaka
 manikanth jataka bhi vinay-pitak par hi aadhaarit he
 Similarly, the Kootadanta Sutta and Mahasudassana Sutta of the long-body and the Makhadeva Sutta of the Majjhim body are also Jataka in full sense
 kam se kam 13 jaatkaan kii khoj vidwaanon ne sutt pitak or vinay-pitak main kii hai
 Although the stories related to Rajkatha chor-katha and similar fears, war, village, corporation, city, district, women, panaghat, ghost and ghost etc
 were seen in terms of helplessness in the monk's union by calling it sordid stories
 phir bhi upadesh ke liye kathaon kaa upyog bhikshu log kuch-na-kuch maatra main karte hi the
 God himself has also preached religion through similes and parables
 buddha sanskrit granth saddharmpundaree sutara ke dwitiya parivart main bhi kaha gaya he ki buddha anek drushtaanton se tathaa jataka ke dwaara sab praaniyon ke kalyanarth upadesh karte hai
 Apart from Buddha, other Indian saints have been preaching religions with the help of fables and parables from the time of the Upanishads to the time of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
 isi pravriti ke aadhaar par jatakakathaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The stories prevalent in public society have also been taken somewhere, but they have been given a new moral form, which is a feature of Buddhism
 atah sabhi jataka kathaon par buddha dharm kii puri chhap he
 They may have the basis of folk lectures from earlier traditions, but their entire structure is compatible with the moral ideal of Buddhism
 buddha vachanon kaa vargeekaran nau angon ke rup main kiya gaya he, jinke naam hai- This nine types of division of the Buddha verses is only in terms of their style forms or patterns, not in terms of texts
 itane prakaar ke buddha upadesh hote the, yahi is vargeekaran kaa abhipraay he
 The division of the Buddha's verses into nine parts of which the number of Jataka is seventh is very ancient
 atah jataka kathaayen sarvansh main pali-sahitya ke mahatvapurn evam aavashyak ang hai
 Uncertainty about their numbers has arisen, especially due to their timely collection of Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka and other sources, and their own assortment of Pali Pitaka and their intermingling
 chull niddes main hamen keval 500 jaatakon kaa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 In the fifth century AD, Chinese traveler Fahyan saw pictures of 500 natives printed in Lanka
 dwitiya tritiy shatabdi isvi purv ke bharhut or sanchi ke stupon main jaatakon ke chitra ankit mili hai
 Out of which pictures of at least 27 or 29 natives were identified by Rais Davids
 tab se kuch anya jataka kahaniyon kii pahchaan bhi in stupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par kii ja chuki hai
 All these facts are indicative of the ancientness and development of the native
 sthaviravaadi pali sahitya ke samaan sanskrit buddha dharm ke granthon main bhi jataka kathaayen pai jaati hai
 Like the Nawang Buddha word of Pali, Dwad Sh Anga here is considered to be the scripture
 in donon hi jagah jataka ek ang yaa dharm-pravachan ke bhaag ke rup main vidyaman he
 In the Buddhist Sanskrit text Jatakamala, which is told the composition of Aryasur, 34 Jataka stories are found
 aryashur ko lamas, tarnath ne ashwaghosh kaa hi doosraa naam bataaya he parantu yah thik nahin jaan padataa he
 Probably he was a poet of the fourth century AD
 lokottaravaadiyon ke prasiddh granth mahavastu main jo 200 i0 purv se 400 i0 tak ke bich ke kaal main likhi gai, kareeb 80 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Some of them are similar to Pali Jataka and there are also some that are not found in Pali Jataka
 rais davids kaa kathan he ki jataka kaa sankalan or pranayan madhya desh main pracheen janakathaon ke aadhaar par hua
 Winternitz has also often expressed this view
 adhikansh jataka buddhakalin he
 The inscriptions of Sanchi and Bharhut's scenes on the stone-vestas give ample evidence of their pre-ashoka period
 jataka ke kaal or kartrutv ke sambandh main adhik prakaash uske saahitiyik rup or visheshtaon ke vivechan se padegaa
 Each Jataka tale is divided into five parts
 panchuppannavatthu kaa arth he vartmaan kaal kii ghatana yaa katha
 The incident that took place during the lifetime of Buddha is Pachauppannavatthu
 us ghatana ne bhagwaan ko kisi purvajanm ke vrut t ko kehane kaa avasar diya
 This is the circle of the past life is past
 prayek jataka kaa katha kii drushti sabase adhik mahatvapurn bhaag yah atitvatthu hi he
 According to this, Pachappannavatthu seems to have been built somewhere
 atitvatthu ke baad ek yaa anek gaathaayen aati hai
 Although they are related to the past only, but in some cases it is also related to the Pachappannavattu
 gaathaayen jataka ke pracheenatam ansh hai
 In fact only the gatakas are native
 pacchuppannavatthu aadi paanch bhaagon se samanvit jataka to vastav main jatakatthawannana yaa jataka main veyyakaran yaa atthav nnana aati he
 It contains interpretations and semantics of gathas
 sabase ant main samodhan aata he, jisamen atitvatthu ke paatro kaa buddha ke jivan kaal ke paatro ke saath sambandh milaayaa jaataa he, yatha us samay ataari par se shikaar khilne vaala shikari ab kaa dev dutt tha or kurung mrug to main tha hi, aadi aadi
 The Jataka contains the stories of the earlier births of the Buddha, while he completed various traditions in the form of the Bodhisattva and perfected his ability for enlightenment
 sutt-pitak ke pratham chaar nikaayon main buddha ke aitihaasik rup kii hi pratishtha he
 Later in the Jataka, they are able to relate their historical life to the earlier stories
 jatakatthakatha kii nidaan katha main buddha jivan ke teen nidaan bataaye gayi hai, duure nidaan main atyant dur ateet kii buddha jivan kii katha he, aisa mana jaataa he ki atyant sudur ateet main buddha sumedh tapasvi banakar utpann hue the
 At that time he showed great loyalty to Dipankar Buddha, as a result he later blessed him to be Buddha
 anek janmon tak vibhinn sharir dhaaran karte hue sume dha tapasvi kii sadhana chalati rahi
 In the end, after leaving his body as Vesantar king, he went to the illiterate world
 sumedh tapasvi ke rup se lekar tushit lok main jane tak kii buddha kii yah sadhana katha dur nidaan ke antargat he
 547 Jataka stories are related to this second diagnosis of Buddha biography from Apanaka Jataka to Vesantara Jataka
 in kathaon se yahan taatpary he inamen varnit atitvatthu
 They are related to the short diagnosis of the life story of Buddha i
e
 these are the stories of the past
 lumbini van main janm lene ke samay se lekar bodhi-prapti tak kii katha avidure nidaan se sambandhit he
 That is, she is not so far away from the past
 bodhi prapti se lekar nirvana prapti tak kii buddha jeevani santike nidaan ke antargat he
 That is, she is near
 jataka kii pacchuppannavatthu main iske kuch ansh prastaavna rup main aate hai
 The stories of the Jataka include the stories of his past births contained within the second diagnosis of Buddha biography in the past
 aitihaasik buddha ke jivan kii kisi ghatana kaa ullekh kar in duure nidaan kii kathaon ke kehane ke liye avkaash nikaal liya gaya he
 Whatever it is actually creates the native
 prayek jataka ke paanch angon ke uparyukt vivechan se spasht he ki jataka gadhy-padya mishrit rachanaayen hai
 The saga part is considered to be the oldest part of the native
 tripitak ke antarbhoot is gaatha bhaag ko hi maananaa adhik upyukt hoga
 The rest is fiction
 parantu jataka-kathaon kii prakruti aisi he ki mul ko vyakhya se alag kar dene par kuch bhi samaj main nahin aa saktaa
 Only the stories do not create the story
 unke upar jab vartmaan or ateet kii ghatnaon ko dhaanchaa chadhaaya jaataa he tabhi kathavstu kaa nirmaan hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to have the above five elements in the whole Jataka, in which all except the saga-part is its explanation, the latter is added
 phir bhi suvidha ke liye or aitihaasik drushti se galat dhang par ham uskon jataka kah dete hai
 In fact, the collection of 547 Jataka tales which are coordinated with the above mentioned five organs, we should not say Jatakattvavana or Jatakathakatha, rather than Jataka
 phosbal or kowal ne jiskaa kramshah roman lipi main or angreji main sampaadan or anuwaad kiya he yaa hindi main bhadant anand kausalyayan ne ‘jataka’ sheershak se 6 bhaagon main anuvaa da kiya he, vah vastav main jataka na hokar jataka kii vyakhya he
 The Jataka tales are basically only gathas, the rest is its interpretation
 gaatha or jataka ke shesh bhaag kaa kalkram aadi kii drushti se kya parsparik sambandh he yah prashn saamne aata he
 In the legend, the story has been called Abhinambabuddha saga or stories sung by Lord Buddha
 ve buddhavachan hai
 Therefore, she was a part of Tipitak and compiled from there, a structure of stories has been presented on her
 sampoorn jataka granth kii vishaywastu kaa jis aadhaar par vargeekaran hua he, usase bhi yahi spasht he ki gaatha-bhaag, yaa jise pinternitj aadi vidwaanon ne gaatha-jataka kaha he, vahiin uskaa muladhar he
 The classification of the Jataka text is based on the number of gathas and not on the basis of subject matter
 ther-theri gaathaon ke samaan vah bhi nipaton main vibhakt he
 The native has 22 falls
 pehle nipaat main 150 aisi kathaayen he jinamein ek kii ek gaatha pai jaati he
 There are 150 Jataka stories in the second fall, but two stories are found in each story
 isi prakaar tisare or chauthe nipaat main pachaas-pachaas kathaayen he or gaathaon kii sankhya kramshah teen-teen or chaar-chaar he
 Further, the same sequence often continues till the thirteenth fall
 chaudaaven nipaat kaa naam pakinnak nipaat he
 The number of gathas in this fall is varied from 14 to not according to the rules
 isliye iskaa naam pakinnak rakh diya gaya he
 10 stories are also found in some stories in this nipati and up to 47 in some stories
 aage ke nipaton main gaathaon kii sankhya nirantar badhati gai he
 The title of the fifteenth ninth is Vis Nispat, Tis Nispat of the sixteenth, forty-nine Nishat of the seventeenth, Panas Nishat of the eighteenth, Sixty Nishat of the nineteenth, Sattinipat of the twentieth and Assinipatam of the twenty-seventh
 bisen nipaat main keval das jataka kathaayen he kintu prayek main gaathaon kii sankhya sau se bhi upar he
 The number of gathas in the last person is above seven hundred
 in sabase yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki jataka kathaon kii aadhaar gaathaayen hi he
 In the interpreting part of many Jataka stories themselves, the distinction between Pali and Atthakatha is shown, as in many other books of Pali Sutras and also in the texts of Visuddhimagga
 jahaan tak jataka ke veyyakaran bhaag se sambandh he, vahaan pali kaa arth tipitak gat gaatha hi ho saktaa he
 From the evidence of language, the saga part is more ancient than the prose section
 pinternitj ne kaha he jataka kii sampoorn gaathaon ko tipitak kaa mul ansh nahin mana ja saktaa he
 There is also a distinction between them
 swayan jataka ke vargeekaran se hi yah spasht he
 In the fourteenth fall, the number of stories of each Jataka tale is not very much 14 as per the rules - somewhere is very high
 isi prakaar biswein nipaat main uski do jataka kathaon kii sankhya sattar-sattar na hokar kramshah 92 or 93 he
 It has been concluded that the original number of the Jatakas or the saga of the Jatakas will be the same as the number of the title of Nipat
 or baad main uskaa sanvardhan kiya gaya he
 So some of the saga is more ancient and some is relatively less ancient
 isi prakaar gadhy bhaag bhi kuch atyant pracheenta ke lakshan liye hue he or kuch apekshaakrit arvachin he
 There is no resemblance between prose and saga part in some people and there is a lot of variation in the style anywhere
 is sabase jataka ke sankalanaatmak rup or uske bhashaaroop kii vividhta par prakaash padataa he jisamen kai rachayitaaon yaa sankalankartaaon or kai shatabdiyon kaa yoga rahaa he
 The antiquity of the Jataka stories is undeniable, most of its prose is also very ancient
 bharhut or sanchi ke stupon kii pashaan veshtoniyon par jo chitra ankit he ve jataka ke gadhy bhaag se hi sambandhit hai
 Therefore, most of the prose part of Jataka which is ancient, in the third, second century BCE must be so popular that it can be made the basis of craftsmanship
 atah saamanytah ham jataka ko buddhakalin bhartiya samaaj or samskruti kaa pratik maan sakate hai
 Some of the signs and stages depicted in it are also from prague-buddhist India and some are from the post-buddha era
 jahaan tak gaathaon kii vyakhya or unke shabdaarth kaa samb ndh he, vah sambhavtah jataka kaa sab se adhik arvachin ansh he
 The author of this excerpt is considered Acharya Buddha Ghosh
 ‘gandhavans’ ke anusaar acharya buddhaghosh ne hi ‘jatakatthannana’ kii rachana kii, kintu yah sandigdh he
 While showing a variation of language style and giving some other prohibitive reasons, Dr
 T
 W
 Royce Davids does not consider Buddhaghosha to be the author or compiler of the Jatakattavavana
 swayan jatakatthakatha ke upodghaat main lekhak ne apana parichay dete hue kaha he ‘‘ xxrep 4 
 shantchitt pandit buddhamitt bhikshu buddhadev ke kehane se xxrep 8 
 vyakhya karunga
 The Mahishasak sect was a Buddhist sect unlike the Mahavihara tradition
 buddhaghosh ne jitani atthakathaayen likhi he, shuddh mahaviharavasi bhikshuon kii upadesh vidhi par aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, it is not right to associate the author of the scripture with Acharya Buddhaghosh
 sambhavtah yah koi anya sinhalai bhikshu the, jinka kaal paanchavin shatabdi isvi mana ja saktaa he
 It contains the following stories: tripitak The Jataka tales relate to the past births of Lord Buddha
 bodhisattva kii charyaaon kaa unamem varnan he
 So, they are all usually didactic
 parantu unka saahitiyik rup bhi nikharaa hua he
 Despite being didactic, he is artistic in its entire sense
 jataka ke aadi main nidaan-katha he, jisame bhagavan buddha ke pehle 24 budhon ke vivaran ke saath-saath bhagwaan gautam buddha kii jeevani letvan vihaar ke daan kii sweekruti tak di gai he
 The summary of some Jataka tales and the form of their subject matter is as follows

 vinternitj ne inkaa vargeekaran paanch bhaagon main is prakaar kiya he
 Vanarind Jataka, Villarwat Jataka, Sihachamm Jataka, Sunsumar Jataka, and Sandhibdha Jataka etc

 These stories are very important
 visheshtah inhen kathaon kaa gaman videshon main hua he
 The cast of satire is also seen here in its poetic form
 praayah pashuon kii tulana main manushyon ko hin dikhaaya gaya he
 One special thing is that satire has been done on the entire caste and not on any person
 ek bandar kuch dinon ke liye manushyon ke bich aakar rahaa
 Later turns to his teammates
 saathi poochhate he-‘‘manushyon ke samaaj main rahe he
 They know their behavior
 hamen bhi kahen
 We want to hear that
 ‘‘ manushyon kii kerani mujhase mat pucho
 Say, we want to listen
 bandar ne kahana shuru kiya,‘‘ hiranya meraa! sona meraa! yahi raat din ve chillaate he
 Two people live in the house
 ek ko munch nahin hoti

 use bahut dhan se kharida jaataa he
 He hurts all the people
 ‘‘ bandar kah hi rahaa tha ki uske saathiyon ne kaan band kar liye‘‘ mat kahen mat kahen‘‘
 Many pictures of this kind of melodious and unique satire will be found in the native

 uddalak jataka main uddalak ke takshashila jane or vahaan ek lok vishrut acharya kii soochna paane kaa ullekh he
 Similarly, in Setuketu Jataka there is mention of Uddālaka's son तुvetuketu to go to Taxila to study arts
 shatapath brahman ke uddalak ko ham uttarapath main bhraman karte hue dekhte he
 Therefore, it is not inconsistent to conclude from this that the Uddālakas of the Jātakas and ्वेvetuketu Brahmins are not different from the persons of these names in the texts and Upanishads
 german vidwaan luders ne sethuketu jataka main aane vaali gaathaon ko vaidic aakhyaan or mahakavy yugin kavy ko milaane vaali kadi kaha he, jo samuchit hi he

 ramayana or mahabharat ke saath jataka kii tulana karte samay hamen yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki in donon granthon ke sabhi ansh buddha purv yug ke nahin he
 There are 2400 verses in the present form of Ramayana
 ramayana main kaha bhi gaya he ‘chaturvinsh sahatrani shlokanam ukt van rishih
 But Buddhist scripture proves that even in the second century AD, there were only 12,000 verses in the Ramayana
 ramayana 2-109-34 main buddha tathagat kaa ullekh miltaa he
 Similarly, there is a description of conflict with Shaka, Yavan etc
 kiskindha kand main sugriv ke dwaara kuru madra or himalay ke bich main yawanon ou r shakon ke desh or nagaron ko sthit bataaya gaya he
 This proves that at the time when the passages were written, the Greeks and Scythians had established their suzerainty over some regions of Punjab
 atah ramayana ke kaaphi ansh maharaj bimbisar yaa buddha ke kaal ke baad likhe gayi
 There is a clear mention of educations in Maha Bharat

 jataka kii anek gaathaon or ramayana ke shlokon main adbhut samanta he
 In Dasaratha Jataka and Devadhamma Jataka we often get the complete outline of rama-katha

 Then there was the House of Representatives and the elite assembly in Parliament
 pratinidhi sabha kaa pratyaksh chunaav hota tha, lekin simit matadhikaar par, sarvajneen purush matadhikaar ko 1925 main apanaaya gaya
 There were high-level nobles in the elite assembly, similar to the British upper house
