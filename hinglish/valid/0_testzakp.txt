 Thakur Roshan Singh was included in the party under this strategy

 Since Roshan Singh was involved in the Bamrauli robbery and all the evidence against them was also found, the police used all the power to get Thakur Roshan Singh hanged and made no effort to find Keshav Chakraborty

 Code Geass was developed as a concept at Sunrise Studios by Ikiro Okouchi and Goro Taniguchi, who proposed to build it with producer Yoshitaka Kawaguchi while they were working on the Overman King Ginner and later the Planetes

 During these early phases of the hypothesis, Kawaguchi approached the famous Mangka gang Clamp for the first time that Clamp was requested to design the characters of the animation series
 clamp ne vikaas ke in charnon se pehle hi pariyojna par hastakshar kar diya evam kai nae vichaar pradaan kiye, jisane series kii setting or paatro ke vikaas main madad pahunchaai
 As the character's design was being developed for Lelouch Lampreuse, Clapp, the protagonist of the series, had the idea of why his hair should be white
 clamp kii sheershasth lekhika ageha okhaava, ne kaha ki, usne uske charitra ko kalpana ek aise charitra ke rup main kii he jise "harkoi" "shant", shabdash, ek "saundarya" ke rup main udhaaharan pesh kar sake
 During these phases of the project, Clamp and Sunrise's staff discussed several possible motivations for the characters; Including Kinky Kids and Tacky and Subasa
 ve ek "hit sho" kii sristi karnaa chaahate the, ek ansi series jiskaa har kisi ke man par jabardast asar ho
 Lelouch's intimate friend, Zero, was one of the first developed characters in which Okououchi needed a mask so that he could also be a part of the series, feeling that it was necessary for the Sunrise show and Clamp also needed a unique unique design that had never been featured on any of Sunrise's shows, later by Sunrise's character designer Takahiro Kimura, Isne first clamp Arts & Style spent their art books and manga series "to" analyze every day, series converted into animation character designs
 While working in animation's character design, he focused on designing a style so that other animators would be able to apply them in original form without deviating from Clamp's original art and style
