 By the end of February, Bothwell was believed to be guilty of the murder of Darnley
 darnle ke pita lennox ne bothewel par scotland kii sansad main mukadmaa chalaane kii maang kii jise mairi ne maan liya lekin saboot jutaney ke liye vakt dene se inkaar kar diya
 Bothwell was freed on April 12 after a 7-hour hearing in the absence of Lenox and lack of evidence
 ek hafte ke baad bothewel ne ek darjan se zyada saamanto, padariyon or prabud janon ko manaa liya ki ve uski rani se shaadi karwaane main madad karengen
 Between 21 and 23 April 1567, Mary met her son for the last time in Stirling
 24 april ko edinburgh waapas jate hue mairi kaa bothewel or uske sipaahiyon ke dwaara apharan hua tha, bah swayan uske saath gayin thi yaa unhen jabardastee dunbar ke kile le jaaya gaya yah gyaat nahin he
 On 6 May Mary and Bothwell returned to Edinburgh and on 15 May they married Protestant customs at Holyrood castle or Holyrood Abbey
 bothewel or uski pehali patni jin gordon, bothewel kii countes jo samant huntli kii bahan thi kaa baarah din pehle hi talaak hua tha
 Initially, Mary felt that many of the lords had accepted and supported her marriage with Bothwell, but Bothwell, who had now become the queen's husband, and his position was elevated from the other ministers in the court and Relations with the courtiers began to become bitter
 yah vivaah logon ke bich behad alokapriy ho gaya tha
 Catholics considered marriage illegal because they did not consider Bothwell's divorce and marriage to Protestant customs proper
 protestant or catholic donon ko hi is baat kaa yakeen nahin tha ki mairi apane purv pati ke hatyaropee se shaadi kar lengi
 The marriage brought a storm in Mary's life and she was very disappointed and frustrated
 26 darbari va samant jo kii scotland main vibhinn shaharon yaa riyasaton ke swami the mairi or bothewel ke khilaaf ho gayi or unke khilaaf sena banane lage
 Mary and Bothwell were confronted by these feudatories at Carberry Hill, but there was no war because many soldiers of Mary's army escaped during the settlement negotiations and their numbers were greatly reduced
 bothewel ko yuddh ke maidan se surakshit jane diya gaya lekin saamanton ne mairi ko bandi bana liya va unhen edinburgh le gayi jahaan bheed ne un ke charitra par sawaal uthaate hue unpar fabtiyaan kaseen
 They got to listen to the adulteries such as adulterers and murderers
 agali raat ko mairi ko lok leven dweep ke bich bich sthit lok leven kila main jail main daal diya gaya
 Mary had an abortion between 
20 and 23 July
 14 july ko unhen apane 1 varshiya putr james 6 ke liye rani ke apane pad ko tyaagane ko majaboor kiya gaya
 James 6 became King and More acting ruler
 jabaki james hepabern yani bothewel ko deshnikala diya ja chukaa tha
 He was imprisoned in Denmark where he died of insanity in 1578
 2 may 1568 ko jorz duglas kii madad se mairi lock leven kile ke apane karawas se bhaag gayin
 She met Moray's small force on 13 May at Langside, with a contingent of 6,000 soldiers
 haarane kii vajah se dakshin kii taraf chali gayin or naav se solve farth ko paar karte hue 16 may ko england pahunch gayin
 She reached Workington in northern England and spent the night at Workington's Fort
 18 may ko kshetreey adhikariyon ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or carlisle mahal le gayi
 Mary thought that Elizabeth would help them regain Scotland's power
 lekin elizabeth satark thim, unhone 26 darbariyon dwaara mairi ke khilaaf kiye gayi vidroh or darnle kii maut main mairi kaa haath hone kii kisi bhi sambhaavnaaon ko jaanchane ke liye jaanchdal gathit kiya
 In mid-july 1568, the British authorities moved Mary to the fort of Bolton, very far from the Scottish border
 oktober 1568 or janvari 1569 ke bich pehle york va baad main westminster main ek jaanch dal ne baithken kin
 While in Scotland his supporters continued to wage a civil war against the acting ruler More and his successors
 ek rani hone ke naate mairi ne kisi bhi adaalat main apane upar mukadmaa chalaane kii takat hone se or york main sunwaayee ke dauraan vyaktigat upasthiti darz karaane se inkaar kar diya
 Mary sent her representatives to the court but Elizabeth denied his presence
 mairi ke khilaaf sabooton ke taur par more ne kuch atra dikhaaye jinhen sandook kii chiththiyaan yaa kaha jaataa he
 —these were unsigned chest sheets that were said to have been sent by Mary to Bothwell
 inamen shaadi ke do anubandh patr the, or 14 panktiyon kii ek prem kavita thi jo ek raja francis 2 kii muhar se susajjit ek foot lambey chaandi ke sandook main pai gayin thim
 Mary is ignorant of these letters and says that following her authorship is not a difficult task to write the same and she does not have any signature on the letters so they are false
 in chitthiyon ko behad ahm mana gaya kyonki iname mairi ke darnle ke katl ko lekar aatmaglani kii bhavanaayen varnit thim
 The Duke of Norfolk, the chairman of the investigation team, considered these letters to be very serious and fierce and of many different kinds of loving songs, and sent copies of them to Elizabeth stating that Mary was guilty if they were real
 sandook ke in patron kii pramanikta itihaaskaaron ke bich vivaad kaa vishay rahi he
 Now it is impossible to prove anything about them
 french bhashaa main likhi gai yah chiththiyaan sambhavat: mairi ke putr dwaara 1584 main nasht kar di gayin thim
 Some of the remaining copies which have been translated into English are also not complete
 anya dastavej jinaki jaanch hui unamem bothewel ke gordon ko diye talaak kii pratiyaan thim jinhen more ne dunbar se mangvayi thim
 Authors of biographies of Mary, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, conclude that the letters were either completely fake or that some deliberate passages were added that could become evidence against Mary
 yaa phir in patron ko kisi or shaks ne bothewel ko yaa phir mairi ne kisi or shaks ko likhaa tha
 Guy says that the language of the letter seems to be different from each other and that there are so many grammatical mistakes in sentences and paragraphs written in French that one cannot expect to be educated and knowledgeable in French like Mary
 haalaanki patron main maujuud kuch anubhag or ardhvakya or kuch lekhan sheliyaan mairi kii lekhan style se mail khaati hai
 The letters of the chest were never released before the 1568 conference
 haalaanki scottish darbariyon ne inhen 1567 main hi dekh liya tha
 Mary was forced to abdicate and was jailed for almost a year
 mairi ko jail bhejne or rani pad se vanchit karne kii kaarywai ko sahi tehraane ke liye in chitthiyon ko kabhi saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya
 Historian Jenny Wormald believes that the Scottish not making these letters public and destroying them in 1584 indicates that there was strong evidence against Mary, while Weir thinks that the events indicate that the Scottish feudal who was Mary's They were opposed, they spent so much time making these letters
 haalaanki mairi ke samakaleen kuch aise vyakti bhi hai jinhone in chitthiyon ko dekha tha or wo inaki sachai par yakeen karte hai jaise kii norflock ke duk jisane sunwaayee ke dauraan mairi se shaadi karne kii gupt yojana banaai thi lekin elizabeth ke dwaara iskaa zikr kiye jane par yah kehete hue isse isse inkaar kar diya ki vah aisi mahila ke saath shaadi karne ke bare main nahin sochataa he jiske saath rahane kaa abhi kuch nahin pataa
 Most of the people of the investigation team considered them right after studying the contents of these letters and matching them with the handwriting of Mary
 elizabeth ne apane chahat ke anusaar jaanch khatm karte hue faisla diya ki mairi yaa uske virdohi scottish saamanton ke khilaaf kuch bhi pakke saboot nahin hai or kuch bhi sabit nahin hota
 For political reasons, Elizabeth did not want Mary to be guilty of Darnley's murder nor innocent, and she did not want to go through the judicial process in this regard
 isaliye is jaanch ko sirf ek rajnatik shigupha hi samajha gaya
 Eventually Morey returned to Scotland and Mary was imprisoned
 is tarah se elizabeth scotland main vahaan kii rani se naahi mitrataa or naahi shatruta pradarshit karte hue ek protestant sarkaar banaae rakhane main kaamyaab raheen
 In Fraser's opinion, this was one of the strangest cases in history in which nothing was proved against both the plaintiff and the defendant, but one was allowed to return to Scotland while the other was held captive
 26 janvari 1569 ko mairi ko tutbari kile le jaaya gaya
 And kept under the supervision of George Talbot and his wife
 elizabeth ne angreji sihansan ke liye mairi ke vichaaron vakaaryon ko apane liye khatra mana or isaliye unhe shrevsbari ke mehalon main bandi bana ke rakhaa
 All these forts were off the border of Scotland and away from London
 mairi ko apane nizi sahaayak va sevak rakhane kii anumati thi jinaki sankhya 16 se adhik rahati thi
 His chambers were decorated with new paintings, decorative items and mats
 unke kaksh main unka rajasi kapadaa jisapar fransisi main mere ant main meri shuruyaat he gutha rahata tha bhi hameshaa susajjit rahata tha
 His servants took care of him, changing sheets and clothes daily by washing and making 32 dishes of his choice which he would serve in silver utensils
 unhen kadi nigaraanee main kabhi kabhi baahar bhi nikalne diya jaataa tha
 He spent most of his time in sewing embroidery
 vyaayaam kii kami, baahar kam nikalne or anya agyaat vajahon se unki tabiyat kharaab hoti gayi, swasth girtaa rahaa or 1580 aate aate unke ghutanon or jodon me dard rahane laga tha
 Overall, it can be said that Elizabeth did not put him in jail, gave him all the royal facilities, but took away his freedom and kept him under detention in various forts in trust of his trusted people
 may 1569 main elizabeth ne mairi ke scotland vaapasi ke liye rasta nikaalane ke liye vahaan protestant dharm kii suraksha va vistaar kii guarantee maangi jise scotland ke perth main yojit ek sammelan main sire se khaarij kar diya gaya
 Norfolk continued to make strategies for marrying Mary, angered by which Elizabeth imprisoned her in the London Tower from October 1569 to August 1570
 agle varsh kii shuruyaat main more kii hatya ho gai va saath hi saath catholicon ke netritv main scotland va uttari england main vidroh shuru ho gaya
 This rebellion of Catholics led Elizabeth to think that Mary could become a proverb for them
 angrej senaaon ne scottish grihayuddh main hastkshep karte hue more samarthak vidrohiyon ko ekajute kiya
 Meanwhile, Elizabeth keeps an eye on Mary with the help of her detectives
 1571 main elizabeth ke mantriyon, cesil or valsingham ne ridolphi shadyantra kaa pardaafash kiya jiskaa uddeshy spani sena or norfott ke duk kii madad se elizabeth ko hataakar mairi ko england kii rani banvaanaa tha
 Norfolk was given the death penalty, and the British Parliament proposed legislation repealing Mary's claim to the English throne, which Elizabeth rejected
 mairi ko badnaam karne ke liye landan main sadook kii chitthiyon kaa mudran or vitaran kiya gaya
 Many such incidents continued to keep Mary at the center
 pope gregory 13 ne 1570 ke purvardh main ek yojana banaai jisamen mairi kaa vivaah spain ke raja philip 2 ke nazaayas bhai or ek praant ke rajyapal austria ke don jon se karne kaa prastaav tha jo spani sena kii madad se netherland kii taraf se england par akraman kii aguwai karne vaala tha
 Following the Throckmorton Conspiracy of 1583, Walsingham proposed to enact a Queen's Protection Act which had legal clauses to punish any of the conspirators against Elizabeth, and to prevent any fictitious heir from gaining the throne by taking advantage of Elizabeth's murder
 farvari 1585 main wiliam peri jo ki ek jasoos tha ko elizabeth kii hatya kaa shadyantra rachate hue giraftaar kiya gaya
 Mary was not aware of this, but her representative Thomas Morgan was involved in the case
 isse elizabeth ko laga ki mairi apane vafaadaaron kii madad se unki hatya karne kii sajeesh rach rahi hai
 In April, Mary was closely supervised by Sir Amias Paulette and at Christmas she was transferred to the Cartley Fort
 11 agast 1586 ko babington shadyantra main doshi paae jane par mairi ko giraftaar kar ke tiksial ke sarkari bhawan le jaaya gaya
 In a successful attempt to prove Mary guilty, Welsingham deliberately made arrangements to get Mary's letters out of Chartley's residence
 mairi ko bataaya gaya ki unki chiththiyaan surakshit haathon main hai lekin vaastaviktaa main vailsingham ne unka kuta khoj liya tha or vah unhen padh letaa tha
 It was clear from these letters that Mary had approved Elizabeth's murder plan
 unhen chaar dinon kii yatra par photheringhe kila le jaaya gaya or oktober main unpar rani suraksha kanoon ke tahat 36 nyayadhishon ke saamne, jinamein se ek vailsingham khud tha, deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya
 In her defense, Mary denied these allegations
 unhone apane virodhiyon ko kaha He pointed out to the judges that he was not even allowed to examine the evidence presented against him, he was not given the liberty to plead and as a foreign queen, he should never be tried for treason under the justice system of England

 25 oktober ko mairi ko gunaahagaar maanate hue 1 ko chod sabhi nyayadhishon ne unhen maut kii sajaa sunai
 Despite this, Elizabeth was reluctant to give him the death penalty
 angreji sansad ke dabaav ke baavjood wo is baat se chintit thim ki kisi rani ko maut kii sajaa dene se ek galat parampara kii shuruyaat ho sakati he, or iske parinaam gambhir ho sakate hai, khaskar tabajab mairi kaa betaa or scotland kaa raja james 6 catholic samoohon ke saath gathjod kar ke england par akraman kar de
 Elizabeth asks Paulet, the last protector of Mary, if he can find a more illegitimate way to reduce her age than to punish Mary, which she refuses, saying that her conscience does not allow her to do so He does not want to leave a black spot in the name of his descendants
 1 farvari 1587 ko elizabeth ne mrityudand ke aadesh par hastakshar kar diye or apane darbari wiliam davisan ke supurd kar diye
 On 3 February, 10 members of the court of England were summoned by Cecil without Elizabeth's knowledge and immediately decided to emulate the sentence
 photheringhe main 7 farvari 1587 kii shaam ko mairi ko unhen agali subah mrityudand die jane kii soochna de di gai
 He spent the last hours of his life praying, distributing his personal belongings to the people and writing his last wishes and letters addressed to the King of France
 phaansi kaa takhte ko great haul main banaaya gaya, yah 2 feet unchaa kaale rang main ranga hua chabutara tha
 There were 3 stools, one Mary, and the other two for the Earls of Shrewsberry and Kent who were about to sit to watch the punishment
 chabutare par ek takiya tha jisapar mairi ko jhuk kar baithna tha or sir lakdi ke saanche main fansaana tha
 The executioners bowed down to Mary and apologized
 mairi ne jawaab diya main tumhen puure dil se kshamaa karti hoon, main ummid karti hoon ki ab tum mere saare dukhon kaa ant kar doge
 Her servants Jane Kennedy, Elizabeth Curl, and the executioners helped Mary to land royal clothes, jewelry and other royal marks
 mairi ab catholicon ke shahadat ke rang, katthi-gaade bhure rang ke aasteen va makhmali peticot main thim
 Kennedy blindfolded them and a gold shawl mounted on a pillow placed in front of the white blanket
 saanche par apana sir rakhte hue mairi ne apni bhujaayen failaayin or apana antim vaakya kaha ki he bhagwaan! main apni aatma aapke haathon main detii hoon
 Mary's head was not separated from the torso in one stroke and the executioner was able to separate her head in the second blow
 kate hue sir ko uthaate hue chillaaya god seve da queen yani "ishwar rani kii raksha karen"
 At this time Mary's head fell down and the wig was left in the executioner's hand, indicating that Mary's hair was very short and brown in her final years
 kaha jaataa he ki mairi kaa paaltu kutta unke paas hi khada tha or khun main bhigane ke baad usne vahaan se jane se inkaar kar diya va apane maalik ke mrit sharir ke paas hi baitha rahaa
 At the last minute, the jewels, clothing, and other related items worn by Mary, with their blood sprinkled on them, were burnt in the chimney of the Great Hall so that future relics could not be found by memorials to find them
 jab yah soochna elizabeth ke paas pahaunchi to wo behad cruddh ho gayin or kaha ki davidson ne warrant darbariyon ko dikhaakar unke aadesh kii avhelnaa kii he or darbariyon ne bina unki marzi ke yah kaarywai kii he
 However, Elizabeth's uncertainty, back and forth, and ambiguous instructions saved her to some degree from the accusations of Mary's murder
 davisan ko giraftaar kare ke main daal diya gaya
 After Cecil and Welsingham pleaded and were not found guilty, he was freed from prison after 19 months
 france main dafnaae jane ke mairi kii chahat ko elizabeth ne thukraa diya
 His corpse was then placed in a safe glass coffin until he was cremated in July 1587 at Peterborough Cathedral under Protestant customs
 sanlepan prakiya ke tahat nikaali gai uski antadiyon va andruni hisson ko photheringhe mahal main chori chupe dafna diya gaya
 His body was excavated in 1612 at the behest of his son and the new King of England, James I, and was buried respectfully in front of Elizabeth I's tomb in Westminster Abbey
 lagbhag dhai sau saalon baad 1867 main unke makbare ko is ummid main dubaara kholaa gaya taaki unke putr james pratham kii kabr kaa pataa lagaaya ja sake jo baad main henry saptam kii kabr ke paas mili
 But all his other descendants, including Elizabeth of Bohemia and Prince Rupert of Aine and the children of Queen Anne, were found in the tomb of Mary's grave
 Assessments of Mary in the sixteenth century divided between Protestant reformers such as George Buchanan and John Knox, who vilified her mercilessly, and Catholic apologists such as Adam Blackwood, who praised, defended and eulogised her
 After the accession of James i in England, historian William Camden wrote an officially sanctioned biography that drew from original documents
 It condemned Buchanan's work as an invention, and "emphasized Mary's evil fortunes rather than her evil character"
 Differing interpretations persisted into the eighteenth century: William Robertson and David Hume argued that the casket letters were genuine and that Mary was guilty of adultery and murder, while William Tytler argued the reverse
 In the later half of the twentieth century, the work of Antonia Fraser was acclaimed as "more objective 


 free from the excesses of adulation or attack" that had characterised older biographies, and her contemporaries Gordon Donaldson and Ian B
 Cowan also produced more balanced works
 Historian Jenny Wormald concluded that Mary was a tragic failure, who was unable to cope with the demands placed on her, but hers was a rare dissenting view in a post-fraser tradition that Mary was a pawn in the hands of scheming noblemen
 There is no concrete proof of her complicity in Darnley's murder or of a conspiracy with Bothwell
 Such accusations rest on assumptions, and Buchanan's biography is today discredited as "almost complete fantasy"
 Mary's courage at her execution helped establish her popular image as the heroic victim in a dramatic tragedy

 Four scripts were in use for Sindhi writings until a century ago
 hindu purush devanagari kaa, hindu striyaan praaia: gurumukhi kaa, vyapaaree log "hatvaniko" kaa or musalmaan tathaa sarkari karmchaaree arabi-farsi lipi kaa prayog karte the
 In 1853 AD, a committee was appointed under the chairmanship of the Commissioner of Sindh, Alice, for the stabilization of the script as decided by the East India Company
 is samiti ne arabi-farsi-urdu lipiyon ke aadhaar par "arabi sindhi " lipi kii sarjana kii
 For Sindhi sounds, new letters were added by adding extra dots to the upper caste letters
 ab yah lipi sabhi virgon dwaara vyavahrut hoti he
 Here Sindhi people of India are successfully adopting the Nagari script
 sindhi ek maatr aisi bhashaa he, jisaki do lipiyon ko bhartiya samvidhan kii manyata he
 There has been a long controversy over the script of Sindhi language and even today there is controversy about it
 sindhi kis lipi main likhi jaae, isko lekar sindhi lekhakon va sahityakaron main do dhade ho chuke hai
 Both these factions came face to face during the recognition of Sindhi language in the constitution
 donon ek duusare kaa virodh karne lage tathaa kendriya sarkaar ke upar apni-apni lipi sindhi lipi tathaa devanagari lipi ko manyata dene ke liye dabaav daalate rahe
 Finally, on 10 April 1967, the Government of India recognized the Sindhi language in the Constitution, as well as the two scripts for the Sindhi language, the arabic-persian and Devanagari scripts
 sindhi bhashaa bhartiya samvidhan kii ek maatr aisi bhashaa he, jiske upyog ke liye do lipiyon ko manyata pradaan kii gai he
 We will call it the good fortune of Sindhi language
 aisa nahin he ki lipi ko lekar aazaadee ke baad hi vivaad hua
 The Devanagari script had also come into existence at the time of united India
 sindhiyon ke janmakshar devanagari lipi main likhe jate the
 In 1923, the Government of Karachi published books of courses in Devanagari
 gadhy kii praarambhik pustaken, jo angrejon ne rachi evam prakashit kin, un main kuch mahatvapurn pustaken devanagari lipi main thim, jo is prakaar hai:- mati azeel bible se saint mauthius kaa anuwaad, 1825, grammer of sindhi language, me
 pranessop 1855, e grammer vocubalari of sindhi language-me
 vathan 1836, vaakubalari of sindhi language- eastvik 1849, e grammer vocubalari of sindhi language- captain stack 1849, e dictionari-angreji-sindhi-captain stack 1849
 In 1947, when the country was divided and Sindh Hindus came to India and settled in many states
 bharat main phir se lipi ke prashn ko uthaaya gaya
 In December 1942, there was a Sindhi Literature Conference in Mumbai, in which it was decided that the Sindhi language should be written in Devanagari script
 yah prastaav sindhi ke suprasiddh granthkaar lalchand amardissoo mel ne rakhaa tha
 Together, freedom fighters, Rajya Sabha members and former Union Minister Dada Jairamdas Daulatram and other Congress Sindhi freedom fighters pushed forward the demand for India's status and Hindi Devanagari script
 iskaa arabi lipi kaa upyog karne vaale sindhi vidwaanon ne virodh kiya
 At the All India Sindhi Conference in Alwar, the All India Sindhi Boli Sahitya Sabha, a representative assembly of Sindhi scholars, academics, journalists and artists, proposed an Arabic script, comprising Govind Malhi, Kirat Babani, Popati Hiranandani, Prof
 Mangaharam
 Malkani and other linguists and academicians
 vaise vastusthiti ye he ki pracheen-arvachin sindhi sahitya, lok-sahitya, dharmik sindhi arabi lipi main hi prakashit he
 The Arabic script itself has most of the facilities of study and teaching
 lipi ke sambandh main swadhinata ke pashchaat aaj tak sangharsh chalaa aa rahaa he
 No clear decision has been made
 chunki rashtrabhasha kii lipi devanagari he or anya bhashaaon kii adhiktar lipiyaan devanagari ke najadik hai, isliye hindi pradeshon main sindhi bhashaa ke liye devanagari kaa prachlan kuch zyada he
 The same script Devanagari script is used for writing in Hindi language, but both arabic-persian and Devanagari scripts are used in Sindhi language writing
 isliye sindhi bhashaa kii vishisht dhvaniyon ke liye devanagari lekhan main vishesh chinh lagaate hai
 For example, in Hindi, there are no intermittent sounds, whereas Sindhi's c, h, b, d sounds are intermixed in Sindhi
 devanagari lipi main ukt lipi-chinhon ke neeche padi rekha laga kar ant:sphutic dhvaniyon ke liye lipi-chinh lagane kii parampara he
 Currently, Sindhi medium schools are being closed in most states of India
 skulon-collejon main sindhi ek vishay ke rup main padhaayaa jaataa he
 This is the reason why the new Sindhi younger generation is being alienated from the Sindhi language
 arabi-farsi lipi siikhnaa unke liye dushwaar sa ho gaya he
 Therefore, Devanagari script is being practiced among the younger generation
 sabhi rajyon ke yuva sindhi lekhak devanagari lipi main lekhan kaary tathaa prakaashan kaary kar rahe hai
 The Sindhi script is becoming increasingly used in practice
 adhiktar rajya sahitya academiyaan bhi apana sahitya devanagari lipi main prakashit kar rahi hai
 Apart from Arabic, Devanagari script is also used in India
 devanagari lipi jo hindi ki tarah baayen se daayen likhi jaati he
 It is a language introduced by the Government of India in 1948
 sindhi likhane ke liye prayukt arabi-farsi lipi main 52 akshar hote he
 Most of it is in Arabic alphabet, some is in Persian alphabet and some new characters have been added
 18 naye akshar, ڄ, ٺ, ٽ, ٿ, ڀ, ٻ, ڙ, ڍ, ڊ, ڏ, ڌ, ڇ, ڃ, ڦ, ڻ, ڱ, ڳ, ڪ he
 Most of these have different forms in the beginning, middle and end

 Convinced of the power and prestige of his new friend Britain in such a situation, he challenged Russia
 rus-japan yuddh isi chunauti kaa parinaam tha
 There was intense tension between Russia and Japan to dominate many regions
 isamen manchuriya or korea ko lekar donon main ghor matbhed utpann ho gaya tha or inhi samasyaon ke kaaran donon ke bich yuddh chhidaa
 The problem of Manchuria first led to a feeling of hatred against each other in Russia and Japan, which ultimately resulted in war
 china kaa uttari pradesh 'manchuriya' kehalaata he
 This region is very rich in terms of economic resources
 koyala, loha or sona yahan prachur maatra main milte hai
 There was a natural conflict between Russia and Japan to establish dominance over such a region
 rus is pradesh ko apane prabhavakshetra main laana chahta tha or iske liye uske paas kai tarah kii yojanaayen thim
 After 1894 AD, Russia took the side of China and forced Japan to take away Japanese authority from Liaotung region by influencing Japan

 Japan itself wanted to assert its authority over Manchuria
 japani samrajya ke vistaar ke liye yah bada hi upyukt sthaan tha
 After the sino-japanese War, this selfishness was hidden behind Japan's authority over Liaotung region
 lekin, rus ke virodh ke kaaran japan ko shimonoseki kii sandhi main sanshodhan sweekaar kar is kshetra par se apana aadhipaty uthaanaa padaa tha
 Hence, a war between Russia and Japan over the establishment of dominion over Manchuria seemed inevitable
 rus or japan ke sangharsh kaa doosraa kshetra korea tha
 After the sino-japanese War, Japan's dominance over Korea was established
 lekin, rus ke hastkshep se japan kii prabhutaa bahut had tak simit ho gai
 Nevertheless, Japan continued its efforts and was trying to maintain full control over Korea

 saath hi, vah bhi prastaav kiya gaya ki ukt sandhi dwaara manchuriya main rus ke hit tathaa korea main japan ke vishesh swaarthon kii raksha kii jaae
 However, Russia refused to accept them
 yah baatcheet janvari, 1904 i

 rus-japan yuddh main japan kii vijay se japan ko chini kshetra main ghus jane kaa acha avasar mil gaya
 Whereas Russia's expansion into East Asia stopped
 manchuriya par uskaa naam-maatr kaa adhikaar rahaa
 In the war, Japan proved that it is a powerful nation in the world
 isi aadhaar par usne britain se anurodh kiya ki angl-japani sandhi main aise sanshodhan kiye jaaen, jisase japan ko kuch adhik laabh ho
 More importantly, Russia's influence over Korea came to an end
 ab japan korea main apni icchaanusaar kaam kar saktaa tha

 In late 2004, the government of Vasundhara Raje succumbed to the coercion of the farmers and the water sent to the bird was stopped, which resulted in the water supply for the garden reduced from 540,000,000 to 18,000,000 cubic feet

 This festival has been celebrated in Japan for more than five years and this festival also has a traditional dance and its name is bon-adhori

 yahan teen prakar ke calendar he
 In the solar calendar, "shichigatas Bon" means Bonn is celebrated in Japan on July 15
 chandra calendar main "hakigtsu bon" yani is bon sajaa 15 agast main manaaya jaataa he
 The story of Bon Odhori is that a great "mokuren" who was a disciple of a Gautama Buddha
 vah apane alokik shakti se apane mritak maan ko bachaane ke liye koshish kii thi
 He came to know that his mother had fallen into the realm of a hungry ghost

 The Buddha said that he should offer to the Buddhist monks who finished their summer residence

 sankhyakarika sankhya darshan kaa sabase purana uplabdh granth he
 Its author is Ishwar Krishna
 sanskrit ke ek vishesh prakaar ke shlokon ko "karika" kehete hai
 The majority of the numerical periods are considered to be middle of the third century AD
 vastut: inkaa samay isse paryaapt purv kaa prathit hota he
 In it, Ishvakrishna has said that he got his education from Kapil to Asuri, from Asuri to Panchashika and from Panchashika
 isamen unhone sankhya darshan kii 'shashtitantr' naamak kriti kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
 The Sankhyakarika has 72 verses written in Arya Chanda
 aisa anumaan kiya jaataa he ki antim 3 shloke baad main jode gayi hai
 Numerous commentaries have been made by various scholars on Sankhyakarika, among them Yukdipika, Gaudapadbhashyam, Jayamangala, Tattvakomudi, Narayanakha Sankhyachandrika etc
 are prominent
 sankhyakarika par sabase pracheen bhashya goudpad dwaara rachit he
 The second important commentary is Sankhyatatvakomudi composed by Vachaspati Mishra
 sankhyakarika kaa chini bhashaa main anuwaad 6thi shatee main hua
 In 1832, Christian Lassen translated it into Latin
 ech tii colbruk ne isko sarvapratham angrejin main roopaantarit kiya
 The initial verses of the numeric body are as follows - sankhyakarika, sankhyadarshan kaa bahut hi mahatvapurn prakaran granth he jisane atyadhik lokapriyata praapt kii he
 Today, the texts of Sankhyadarshan are received, only the interpretation books are more
 mul granth to keval teen hi praapt hote hai- sankhyakarika, tatvasamaas evam sankhyapravachansutra
 The other texts of Sankhyadarshan which are received today are in the form of commentary or interpretation of these three original texts
 in vyakhya-granthon main se adhikansh ‘sankhyakarika’ kii hi vyakhyaaon or in vyakhyaaon kii bhi anuvyakhyaaon ke rup main hai
 Thus 'sankhyakarika' of Ishvarakrishna is the major representative text of Sankhyadarshana
 shankar aadi aacharyon ne hi nahin, apitu isa kii chaudaavin shatabdi tak ke aacharyon ne ‘tatvasamaas’ yaa ‘sankhyapravachansutra’ ko apane granthon main uddhrut na kar ‘sankhyakarika’ ko hi uddhrut kiya he
 At the same time, no one even explained these sutras before the 15th century Anirudh, while interpretations of 'samkhikarika' have been presented by various scholars long back
 atah spasht he ki sankhyadarshan ke aaj uplabdh hone vaale ukt teen mul granthon - sankhyakarika, tatvasamaas evam sankhya-pravachansutra- main se ‘sankhyakarika’ pracheenatam he
 Since it has been quoted by Sankara etc
 Acharyas, it is also clear that it has been considered an authentic work of Sankhyadarshana
 sankhyakarikakaar ishwarkrishna ne yah ghoshnaa bhi kii he ki sankhya ke pratham acharya paramarshi kapil ne jo gyaan apane shishy asuri ko diya, use asuri ne apane shishy panchasikh ko diya, panchasikh ne use vistrut kiya or phir uske baad shishy-parampara se praapt-usee vistrut gyaan ko sankshipt rup se unhonen sankhyakarika kii sattar karikaon main prastut kar diya he
 This declaration reveals the authenticity of Sankhya as the traditional knowledge of Sankhya
 kahana na hoga ki is gyaan or pramanikta ke anuroop hi is granth ko darshanik kshetra main param sammaan praapt hua he
 The statute gained popularity and authenticity only after its creation that often its tradition of interpretations or commentaries followed
 isaki sarvapracheen vritti mathar vritti he
 Acharya Mathar, the author of this practice, is considered to be present during the reign of King Kanishka
 is prakaar yah vritti pratham shatabdi isvi kii rachana maani jaati he
 The second major interpretation of Sankhyakarika is considered to be Gaudapadabhashya after chronology
 vidwaanon kaa bahumat iske rachayita gaudpad ko mandukyakarika ke rachayita evam advait veydant ke acharya gaudpad se bhinn maanane ke paksh main hai
 The time of Goudapada, the interpreter of the Samkhikarika, is often considered to be the best century of Christ
 kuch vidvan isa kii saptam shatabdi maanate hai
 There are many passages in Samyavruti and gaudapada-bhashya
 gaudpadbhaashya sankshipt hote hue bhi gambheer he
 The 'yakshadipika' vaccine of Sankhyakarika is also one of the ancient commentaries
 iske rachayita kaa naam agyaat he
 It mentions various theories of ancient Sankharyas
 faltah is tikaa se sankhya-siddhanton kii paryaapt jaankaree praapt hoti he
 Since it mentions the views of Buddhist masters like Vasubandhu and Dinnag and also does not contain the instruction of Kumarail or Prabhakar while instructing Shabaraswamy in the Mimansakas, it seems that this is a later work from the said Buddhist masters and pre-kumarila
 
 kumaril kaa samay isa kii saptam shatabdi kaa ant or ashtum shatabdi kaa purvardh mana jaataa he, atah bahut sambhav he ki yukti-deepika isa kii saptam shatabdi ke purvardh kii rachana he
 The 'jayamangala' commentary authored by Shankaracharya is also a well-known commentary by the numeric author
 vidwaanon kaa mat he ki yah tikaa vachaspati mishra se purv kii rachana he, kyonki aisa prathit hota he ki ‘sankhyatatvakoumudi’ main kuch sthalon par iske pratipaadyon kaa nirdesh yaa anusaran kiya gaya he
 Acharya Vachaspati Mishra's 'sankhyatattvakomudi' commentary is the most famous commentary of Sankhyakarika
 isane darshanik jagat main paryaapt khyaati evam lokapriyata praapt kii he
 In this commentary, an attempt has been made to fully disclose the major topic of the numerology
