 Due to all this, the game of this world is happening
 sankshep main, yahi sristi kaa kram he
 Even if there is a change in nature, it remains the same as men
 phir bhi ek baat hoti he
 Just as bringing colorful flowers in front of white crystals gives them a colorful reflection on them, similarly the male gets reflections of natural deformities
 kramash: vah buddhi se lekar kshiti tak se ranjit prathit hota he, apane ko prakruti ke in vikaron se sambhddha maanane lagata he
 Today, he considers himself as rich, poor, strong, weak, family, happy, sad, etc
 apane shuddh rup se dur ja padaa he
 This is his illusion, avidya
 pradhan se bane hue in padaartho ne uske rup ko dhank rakhaa he, uske upar kai tah khol pad gai he
 If he throws away these shells, these coverings, he will get rid of them
 jis kram se bandhaa he, uske ulate kram se bandhan tootenge
 One has to rise above mahabhutas first
 ant main pradhan kii ore se munh pherana hoga
 This bond is not real, but seems to be very firm
 jis upyog se bandhanon ko todakar purush apane shuddh swaroop main sthit ho sake us upaay kaa naam yoga he
 The teacher of Sankhya says: Yadva tadva taduchhitti: Parampurushartha: - As far as possible, the removal of this artificial combination of male and head is the ultimate effort
 yoga kaa yahi darshanik dharaatal he: avidya ke dur hone par jo avasthaa hoti he uskaa varnan vibhinn aacharyon or vichaarkon ke vibhinn dhang se kiya he
 According to their respective views, they have also given him different names
 koi use kaivalya kahata he, koi moksh, koi nirvana
 After reaching up, the person who has the experience should say it as such
 vastut: vah avasthaa aisi he, yato vaacho nivartate aprapya mansa sah - jahaan man ore vaani kii pahunch nahin he
 It is necessary to discuss one more thing in a few words
 asankhya purushon ke saath patanjali ne 'purush vishesh' naam se ishwar kii satta ko bhi mana he
 The teacher of Sankhya does not believe so
 vastut: maanane kii aavashyaktaa bhi nahin he
 Even if he removes some formulas from Yogadarshana, then there is no difference
 yoga kii sadhana kii drushti se ishwar ko maanane, na maanane kaa vishesh mahatv nahin he
 Both believers and non-believers in the authority of God have equal rights in yoga
 vidya or avidya, bandhan or usase chhutkaaraa, sukh or du:kha sab chitt main hai
 Therefore, whoever is desirous of getting a position in his own form, he will have to try to remove his mind from those things, which pull the head towards the head and its disorders and create a feeling of happiness and sorrow
 is tarah chitt ko hataane tathaa chitt ke aisi vastuon se hat jane kaa naam vairaygy he
 This is the first step of yoga
 purna vairaygy ekadam nahin hua karata
 As soon as a person is engaged in the practice of yoga, as soon as quietness also increases and as soon as quietness increases, the trend in cultivation increases
 jesa patanjali ne kaha he: drusht or anushravik donon prakaar ke vishyon main virakti, gandhi ji ke shabdon main anasakti, honi chahie
 Heaven etc
, whose knowledge we get from the words and scriptures of the Mahatmas, is called Anuprivika
 yoga kii sadhana ko abhyaas kehete hai
 Here for many hundred years, the word Bhajan has also started in the sages in this beginning
 chitt jab tak indriyon ke vishyon kii ore badhata rahegaa, chanchal rahegaa
 The senses will keep him in contact with other food items one after the other
 kitnon se viyog bhi karaati rahengi
 There will be hundreds of opportunities for stimulating work, anger, greed, etc
 sukh du:kha kii nirantar anubhuti hoti rahegi
 In this way, the bond with the head and its disorders that have been going on for many births will continue to become stronger and stronger
 at: chitt ko indriyon ke vishyon se khinchakar antarmukh karnaa hoga
 Many remedies have been given for this, whose details need not go into details
 saadhaaran manushya ke chitt kii avasthaa kshipt kehalaati he
 He throws from one subject to another
 jab usko praytn karke kisi ek vishay par laayaa jaataa he tab bhi vah jaldi se vishyantar kii ore chalaa jaataa he
 This state is called deranged
 dirdh praytn ke baad sadhak use kisi ek vishay par der tak rakh saktaa he
 The name of this stage is concentrated
 chitt ko vasheebhoot karnaa bahut kathin kaam he
 Sri Krishna has described it as a strong balwat-like elephant
 chitt ko vash main karne main ek cheez se sahaayta milti he
 It is a matter of ordinary experience that as long as the body is fickle, the mind is fickle and the fickleness of the mind keeps the body fickle
 sharir kii chanchalta nadisanthaan kii chanchalta par nirbhar karti he
 As long as the radius of the pulse is weak, the senses on the body will be subject to acceptable subjects
 un aadhaaton kaa prabhaav mastishk par padegaa jiske falswaroop chitt or sharir donon main hi chanchalta bani rahegi
 To make the mind immobile, the yogi takes the same measures as is sometimes required in war
 kisi prabal shatru se ladane main yadi uske mitron ko parrast kiya ja sake to safalataa kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 In order to gain authority over the mind, the yogi tries to subdue the body and also the nadisastha, mainly in it
 sharir bhautik he, naadiyaan bhi bhautik hai
 That is why it is easy to deal with them
 jis prakriya se yah baat siddh hoti he uske do ang hai: asana or pranayam
 The body becomes immobile by posture
 bahut se asana kaa abhyaas to swasthya kii drushti se kiya jaataa he
 Patanjali has said this much: Steady Sukhmasanam: The posture on which one can sit for long periods without suffering is superior
 yahi sahi he ki asanasiddhi ke liye swasthya sambandhi kuch niyamon kaa paalan aavashyak he
 As Shri Krishna has said in the Gita- khaane, pine, sone, jaagane sabhi kaa niyantran karnaa hota he
 There is a lot of confusion regarding the word Pranayama
 is bhram kaa kaaran yah he ki aaj log praan shabd ke arth ko praaia: bhul gaye hai
 Many people, who call themselves Yogis, forget about this word
 yogi ko is baat kaa praytn karnaa hota he ki vah apane praan ko sushumna main le jaay
 The spinal cord is located in the duct of the spinal cord and reaches under the brain
 yah koi gupt cheez nahin he
 Can be seen with eyes
 kareeb-kareeb kanashtha ungali ke baraabar moti hoti he, thos he, isamen koi chhed nahin he
 Pran and the breath or wind do not know that there is no way for air to enter this pulse and to climb up
 praan ko hawa kaa samanarthak maanakar hi aisi baaten kahi jaati hai ki amuk mahatma ne apni saans ko brahmad main chadha liya
 Control of breath helps in stabilizing the nervous system, but the main aim of the yogi is control of life, not breath
 praan vah shakti he jo nadisanthaan main sanchaar karti he
 All the components of the body and all the metals get life and activity from life itself
 jab sharir ke sthir hone se ore pranayam kii kriya se, praan sushumna kii ore pravrutt hota he to uskaa pravaah neeche kii naadiyon main se khinch jaataa he
 Therefore, these nadis become zero in a way from the outer half
 pranyam kaa abhyaas karnaa or pranayam main safalataa paa janaa do alag alag baaten hai
 But the path of success paves the way of quietness and intense emotion
 jyon-jyon abhyaas drudh hota he, tyon-tyon sadhak ke aatmavishvaas main vruddhi hoti he
 One more thing happens
 vah jitna hi apane chitt ko indriyon or unke vishyon se dur khinchataa he utana hi uski andriya shakti bhi badhati he arthath indriyon kii vishyon ke bhoga kii shakti bhi badhati he
 That is why the name of Pratyahara is taken after Pranayama
 pratyaahaar kaa arth he indriyon ko unke vishyon se kheenchna
 This sermon has been given in the context of disinterest, but it is especially important to reach Pranayam
 asana, pranayam or pratyaahaar ke hi samucchy kaa naam hathyog he
 Sadly, some practitioners stop here
 jo log aage badhate hai unke maarg ko teen vibhaagon main baanta jaataa he: dharna, dhyaan or samadhi
 It is impossible to completely separate these three from each other
 dhaaran pusht hokar dhyaan kaa rup dhaaran karti he or unnat dhyaan hi samadhi kehalaata he
 Patanjali has called all three in moderation
 dharna vah upaay he jisase chitt ko ekagra karne main sahaayta milti he
 Here the word remedy is used singularly, but in fact there are many ways of doing this work
 inamen se kuch kaa charchaa upanishdon main aayaa he
 The word Vidya is used in Vedic Vadmaya
 kisi mantra ke jap, kisi dev, devi yaa mahatma ke vigrah yaa surya, agni, deepashikha aadi ko sharir ke kisi sthanvishesh jese hriday, murgha, til arthath donon aankhon ke bich ke bindu, inamen se kisi jagah kalpana main sthir karnaa, is prakaar ke jo bhi upaay kiye jaayan ve sabhi dharna ke antargat hai
 As Patanjali has written after elaborating some measures - Dhyanamitat Dhyadvadva - Concentrating the mind on an object that feels good can work
 kisi puraana main aisi katha ai he ki apane guru kii ajna se kisi ashikshit vyakti ne apni bhens ke madhyam se chitt ko ekagra karke samadhi praapt kii thi
 The best method of perception is that which is called Nadanusandhan in the old words
 kabir or unke parvarti santon ne ise surat shabd yoga kii sangya di he
 Just as the playful antelope forgets to fill the quartet after being enchanted by the Veena's vocals, similarly the mind of the seeker becomes stagnant by quivering from the effects of the sound
 vah naad koun sa he jisamen chitt kii vrittiyon ko lay karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he or yah prayaas kaise kiya jaataa he, ye baaten to gurumukh se hi jaani jaati hai
 The subtlest form of inner feeling is called Pravala, Omkar
 pranav vastut: anuccharyya he
 It can be felt, not euphemism in speech, in the words of Nadvindupanishad: pranav ke anusandhan se, jyotirmaya or kalyankari naad udit hota he
 Then the soul manifests itself in the same way as the moon when the cloud is removed
 aadi shabd aankaar ko paramatma kaa pratik kaha jaataa he
 Its glory has been sung everywhere among yogis
 bible ke us khand main, jise saint jans gaspel kehete hai, pehla hi vaakya is prakaar hai, aarambh main shabd tha
 That word was with God
 vah shabd paramatma tha
 Sufi saints say haif dar bande jism darmani, nor shaunvi saute pake rahmani It is a matter of sorrow that you remain in the bondage of the body and do not listen to the holy divine sound
 chitt kii ekaagratha jyon jyon badhati he tyon tyon sadhakar ko anek prakaar ke anubhav hote hai
 Man is not familiar with the power of his senses
 unase na to kaam letaa he or na lenaa chahta he
 This sounds surprising, but true
 maan lijie, hamaari chakshu yaa shroatra indria kii shakti kal aaj se kai guna bad jaay
 Then do not know how many such things will start to be visible, which we will tremble upon seeing
 ek duusare ke bheetar kii rasinic kriya yadi ek baar dekh pad jaay to apane priy se priy vyakti kii ore se ghrinaa ho jaaygi
 What does our supreme friend say about us sitting in a nearby cell, if i come to listen to this, then it becomes difficult to live
 ham kuch vaasanaon ke putale hai
 With their senses, they work only as long as there is satisfaction of lusts
 isaliye indriyon kii shakti prasupt rahati he parantu jab yogabhyas ke dwaara vaasanaon kaa newnaadhik shaman hota he tab indriyaan nirbaadh rup se kaam kar sakati hai or hamako jagat ke swaroop ke vaastavik rup kaa kuch parichay dilaati hai
 In this world there is a huge store of touch, form, juice and smell, whose power we do not experience
 anrtarmukh hone par bina hamaare prayaas ke hi indriyaan is bhandar kaa dwaar hamaare saamne khol detii hai
 There are many glands of nadis in Sushumna, in which nadis come from many places
 in sthanon ko chakra kehete hai
 The discussion of the six chakras in particular comes in the texts of Yoga
 sabase neeche muladhaar he jo praaia: us jagah par he jahaan sushumna kaa aarambh hota he
 And at the top is the command cycle which is in place of mole
 ise tritiy netra bhi kehete hai
 Walking a little further, the spinal cord joins the brain's umbilical cord
 mastishk ke us sabase upar ke sthaan par jise sharir vigyaan main cerebram kehete hai, sahasrarchakr he
 As one Mahatma has said: moolmantra karband vichaari saat chakra nav shodhai nari
 
 yogi ke praarambhik anubhavon main se kuch kii ore upar sanket kiya gaya he
 Some such experiences are also mentioned in the Shveteshwar Upanishad
 vahaan unhone kaha he ki anal, anil, surya, chandra, khadyot, dhooma, sphuling, taare abhivyaktikarani yoge hainsh yah sab yoga main abhivyakt karaanevaale chihn hai arthath inke dwaara yogi ko yah vishwaas ho saktaa he ki main thik maarg par chal rahaa hoon
 On top of this, it is impossible to describe the experiences that the yogi experiences while reaching the Samadhi
 kaaran yah he ki unka varnan karne ke liye saadhaaran manushya ko saadhaaran bhashaa main koi pratik yaa shabd nahin miltaa
 Good yogis have said in relation to his description that this work is similar to eating dumb jaggery
 purnang manushya bhi kisi vastu ke swaad kaa shabdon main varnan nahin kar saktaa, phir goonga bechaara to asamarth he hi
 Some introduction to the taste of jaggery can also be given on the basis of its resemblance to the taste of fruits or any other sweet thing, but the experience that we usually don't have, is really beyond speech
 samadhi kii sarvocch bhoomika ke kuch neeche tak asmita rah jaati he
 This belief remains as its separate entity
 aham asmi = main hoon kii santan arthath nirantar is bhaavana ke kaaran vahaan tak kaal kii satta he
 After this, the skinny remains ignorant
 uske shay hone kii avasthaa kaa naam asampragyaat samadhi he jisamen avidya kaa bhi kshay ho jaataa he or pradhan se kalpit sambandh kaa viched ho jaataa he
 This is the culmination of yoga
 iske aage phir shastrarth kaa dwaar khul jaataa he
 The teacher of Sankhya says that for the yogi man who has reached here, then the game of nature stops
 duusare logon ke liye jari rahata he
 He explains this as such
 kisi jagah nrity ho rahaa he
 Many people are watching him
 ek vyakti unamem aisa bhi he jisko us nrity main koi abhiruchi nahin he
 He turns his eyes towards the dancer
 uske liye nrity nahin ke baraabar he
 It is interesting for another
 unhone kaha he ki us aja ke saath arthath nitya ke saath aj akonushete = ek aj shayan karata he or jahatenam bhuktavogam tathanya:-uske bhoga se trupt hokar doosraa tyaag detaa he
 The Acharya Sankhya Sammata of Advaita Vedanta does not accept the diversity of men
 unke atirikt or bhi kai daarshnik sampradaay hai jinke apane alag alag siddhant hai
 It has been said earlier that there is no need to fall here in this debate
 jahaan tak yoga ke vyavhaarik rup kii baat he usamen kisi ko virodh nahin he
 The Acharyas of Vedanta also acknowledge the utility of Nirididhyasana and in Vedanta philosophy Vyasa has also supported it in formulas like Asakradabhyasat and Aasin: Sambhavat
 itnaa hi hamaare liye paryaapt he
 Generally Yoga is called Ashtanga, but so far only six limbs have been mentioned from Asana to Samadhi
 shesh do angon ko isaliye nahin choda ki ve anaavashyak hai varan isliye ki vah yogi hi nahin pratyut manushya maatr ke liye param upyogi hai
 Yama is the first among them
 inke sambandh main kaha gaya he ki yah desh kaal, samay se anavchhinn ore saarvbhaum mahabrat hai arthath prayek manushya ko prayek sthaan par prayek samay or prayek avasthaa main prayek vyakti ke saath inkaa paalan karnaa chahie
 The second part is called niyam
 jo log ishwar kii satta ko sweekaar nahin karte unke liye ishwar par nishtha rakhane kaa koi or nahin he
 But those people also have faith in someone who is like God to them
 buddha ko buddhadev ke prati jo nishtha he vah usase kam nahin he jo kisi bhi ishwarwadi ko ishwar par hoti hogi
 There is one more thing
 kisi ko ishwar par shraddha ho yaa na ho, yoga maarg ke upadeshta guru par to anany shraddha honi hi chahie
 For the practitioner, the Guru's place is not less than God
 ishwar ho yaa na ho parantu guru ke hone par to koi andeh ho hi nahin saktaa
 Sahajobai, a disciple of a seeker Charanadas Ji, has said: aaj kal yah baat sunne main aati he ki param purusharth praapt karne ke liye gyaan paryaapt he
 Yoga is not required
 jo log aisa kehete hai, vah gyaan shabd ke arth par gambhirtha se vichaar nahin karte
 There are two types of knowledge - tacism and tacit knowledge
 donon main antar he
 a person can spend his whole life in studying chemistry etc
 to get information about sugar
 shakkar ke anu main kin kin rasinic tatwon ke kitne kitne parmaanu hote hai? shakkar kaise banaai jaati he? usapar koun koun si raasaanik kriya or pratikriyaayein hoti hai? ityadi
 All this is knowledge about sugar
 yah bhi upyogi ho saktaa he parantu shakkar kaa vaastavik gyaan to usee samay hota he jab ek chutki shakkar munh main rakhi jaati he
 This is the philosophy of sugar
 shastron ke adhyayan se jo gyaan praapt hota he vah sachcha aadhyatmik gyaan he or uske prakaash main tadvishyak gyaan bhi puri tarah samaj main aa saktaa hai
 That is why according to the Upanishads, when Yama preached spiritual knowledge to Nachiketa, then along with him the initiation of the Yogavidhi f Kratsnam, otherwise the perception of Nachiketa would remain incomplete
 jo log bhakthi aadi kii sadhana rup se prashansa karte hai unkosh bhi yah dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki yadi unke maarg main vitt ko ekagra karne kaa koi upaay he to vah vastut: yoga kii dharna ang ke antargat he
 It is his wish that Sanatan practice new words excluding Yoga
 yoga ke abhyaas se us prakaar kii shaktiyon kaa udai hota he jinako vibhuti yaa siddhi kehete hai
 If, even after practicing for a sufficient period of time, no such extraordinary powers have been attained in any human being, it should be assumed that he is not following the right path
 parantu siddhiyon main koi jaadu kii baat nahin he
 The power of the senses is very high but generally we do not know it and neither do we use it
 abhayasi ko us shakti kaa parichay miltaa he, usko jagat ke swaroop ke sambandh main aise anubhav hote hai jo dusron ko praapt nahin hai
 Seeing distant or hidden things, listening to the things used, etc
 are within the limits of the innate power of the senses, but for ordinary people, this is a matter of wonder, these will be called accomplishment
 isi prakaar manushya main or bhi bahut si shaktiyaan hen jo sadhran avasthaa main prasupt rahati hai
 Wakes up with the practice of yoga
 yadi ham kisi sadak par kahin ja rahe ho to apane lakshya kii ore badhate hue bhi anayas hi daahine baayein upasthit vishyon ko dekh lenge
 The truth is that anyone who stops to see these subjects will not reach the destination and will remain in the middle
 isiliye kaha gaya he ki jo koi siddhiyon ke liye praytn karata he vah apane ko samadhi se vanchit karata he
 Patanjali has said: arthath ye vibhutiyaan samadhi main baadhak hai parantu samadhi se uthne kii avasthaa main siddhi kehalaati hai
 Namaste or Namaskar is a term mainly used by Hindus and Indians to show greetings and humility when they meet each other
 is bhav kaa arth he ki sabhi manushyon ke hriday main ek divine chetana or prakaash he jo anahath chakra main sthit he
 The word derives from the Sanskrit Namas word
 is bhavamudra kaa arth he ek aatma kaa duusari aatma se aabhaar prakat karnaa
 In everyday life, the word Namaste is used to meet someone or to say good luck while taking leave or to greet
 namaste ke atirikt namaskara or pranaam shabd kaa prayog karte hai
 According to Sanskrit grammar, its origin is as follows - Namaste = Namah + Te
 arthath tumhaare liye pranaam
 In Sanskrit, 'namah' is invariably used for worship or respect, such as "surya Namah"
 isi prakaar yahan- "tumhaare liye pranaam he", ke liye yushmad kii chaturthi vibhakti kaa prayog hota he
 By the way, the common usage of Sanskrit for "for you" is "tubhyam", but the alternate, abbreviated form of "te" is also used a lot, here the same is used
 atah namaste kaa shabdic arth he- tumhaare liye pranaam
 It can also be called "salute you" or "salute you"
 parantu iskaa sanskrit rup hameshaa "tumhaare liye namah" hi rahata he, kyonki namah avyay ke saath hameshaa chaturthi vibhakti aati he, aisa niyam he
 To salute, both hands are placed on the Anahata Chak, the eyes are closed and the head bowed
 iske alaava The word hello is now worldwide
 vishwa ke adhikansh sthanon par iskaa arth or taatpary samajha jaataa he or prayog bhi karte hai
 As a fashion, it is custom to say Namaste in many places
 yadhyapi pashchim main "namaste" bhavamudra ke sangyojan main bolaa jaataa he, lekin bharat main ye mana jaataa he ki bhavamudra kaa arth namaste hi he or isliye, is shabd kaa bolnaa itnaa aavashyak nahin mana jaataa he
 Divine love flows by bringing the hands on the heart chakra
 sir ko jhukaane or ankhen band karne kaa arth he apane aap ko hriday main virajman prabhu ko apane aap ko saunp dena
 One can also be Namaste to drown in deep meditation; It is a beautiful and intense meditation when done with someone else
 ek shikshak or vidhyaarthee jab ek duusare ko namaste kehete hai to do vyakti urjaatmak rup se ve samay or sthaan se rahit ek judaav bindu par ek duusare ke nikat aate hai or ahan kii bhaavana se mukt hote hai
 If this is done by dedicating the mind with a deep sense of heart, then a kindred relationship is formed between two souls
 adarsh rup se, namaste kaksha ke aarambh or samaapti par kiya janaa chahie
 This is usually done at the end of class because then the mind is less active and the energy of the room is more calm
 shikshak namaste kahkar apane chaatro or apane shikshakon kaa abhivadan karata he or apane chaatro kaa swaagat karata he ki ve bhi utane hi gyanvaan bane or satya kaa pravaah ho

 The United Arab Emirates was known as the Armistice Treaty State before 1971 because of a treaty between the United Kingdom and several Arab sheikhs in the 19th century

 bank dar vah dar he jis par kendriya bank vyapaarik bainko ko pratham shrenee kii pratibhutiyon par karj pradaan karata he Banks often require large sums of money for their day-to-day operations that do not last more than a day
 iske liye bank jo vikalp apanaate hai, unamem sabase saamaanya he kendriya bank se raat bhar ke liye karj lenaa
 The interest that the Reserve Bank has to pay on this loan is called the repo rate
 ripo rate kam hone se bainkon ke liye rigerv bank se karj lenaa sasta ho jaataa he or isliye bank byaaj daron main kami karte hai, taaki zyada se zyada rakam karj ke taur par di ja sake
 The increase in the repo rate simply means that it will become expensive for banks to take overnight loans from the Reserve Bank
 saaf he ki bank dusron ko karj dene ke liye jo byaaj dar tay karte hai, vah bhi unhen badhanaa hoga

 The city was partitioned after World War II

 It was mainly divided into two parts - one West Berlin and the other East Berlin
 pashchimi berlin vastut: pashchimi germany ke sangheey ganraajya kii rajdhani ke rup main tha or is par sanyukt rajya america, great britain tathaa france kaa sanyukt adhikaar tha
 East Berlin became completely under the Democratic Republic of East Germany and was in fact under the patronage of Russia

 Its development initially began with two villages called Kaln and Berlin
 berlin spri nadi ke dakshin main tathaa kaln uttar main nadi kii donon bhujaaon dwaara nirmit tapu par viksit hua
 The rules and administration of these two cities were completely different, yet both remained under the general executive since 1307
 aage chalakar san 1709 i

 After some time, the condition of these two cities for the business of East and north-east appeared to be very important and in this view, their progress was great
 samrik drushti se bhi iskaa sthaan adwitiya samajha gaya
 Thus rapid trade advancement necessitated its connection with the progressive northern cities of Germany and eventually it joined the Hanseatic League to serve its objectives
 phir to vibhinn vaataavaran evam paristhitiyon main berlin shanai: shanai: viksit hota rahaa
 In the early 19th century, there were many internal and external disturbances in Berlin which hindered the progress of this city
 aage chalakar phir vah upyukt avasar aayaa jab nagar kii unnati bhalee prakaar hui
 From 1860 to 1920 there was no change in the boundary of Berlin, although in 1912 AD, an institution of the major city and its surrounding areas was formed and the entire areas included in it were called the Great Berlin

 jo bhi ho, itnaa avashya he ki vibhinn raajnneetik paristhitiyon ke kaaran berlin main yatayaat bahut badhapurna rahaa he
 In Berlin, traffic service from one part to another is prevalent but trains have to be changed at departmental boundaries
 nity purvi berlin ke log pashchim berlin main dukandaaree aadi kaary karne ke liye jate rahete hai
 In fact, the problem of East and West Germany has reduced the commercial importance of Berlin, especially in terms of water traffic
 san 1945 ke pehle berlin nagar germany kaa prasiddh vyapaarik, beemaa, baking evam dallali kaa centre rahaa
 There were also offices of innumerable huge buildings
 udyog dhandhon ke maamalon main bhi yah nagar bejod rahaa or har prakar ke vaigyanik upkaran, bijli ke saamaan, mashine, motaren, vastra, vayuyan, mashiinon ke aujaar, terbine, tractor, lens aadi banane main europe main iskaa pramukh sthaan rahaa
 From 1945 onwards Berlin tried to regain its economic potential, but the strangely difficult political conditions here crippled West Berlin, causing a problem of unemployment
 yah bhi dekhen: germany kii arthvyavastha a dometer or galvanometer is a type of ammeter
 yah kisi paripath main dhara kii upasthiti kaa pataa karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Often ampere, volt or ohm marks are not placed on it
 Current senstivity-cs-nab \ ksi unit of current senstivity is Radian / Ampiar There can be many types of photometer sparshajya dharamapi sabase saral or upyogi chalchumbak dharamapi he
 There is a circular coil of insulating copper wire on the vertical structure of an non-magnetic material
 kundali main praaia: 552 chakkar hote hai, jisamen 2, 50 or 500 chakkaron ke baad sanyojak pench lage rahete hai
 With their help, you can work with fewer or more rounds as needed
 vrittakar kundali ko urdhwadhar aksh ke chaaron ore ghumaya ja saktaa he
 a magnetic needle rests on the vertical rivet at the center of the coil and a long indicator of aluminum perpendicular to the needle, which rotates along the needle on a horizontal circular scale and deflects the magnetic needle
 yah scale chaar chaturthaanshon main vibhajit rahata he or prayek chaturthaansh main 0 degree se 90 degree tak ke chihn hote hai
 When the magnetic needle is in the magnetic meridian, the indicator remains at zero degree
 dhara naapane ke purv dharamapi ke aadhaar ko kshaitij kar lete hai or kundali ke samtal ko ghumaakar chumbakeey yamyottar main le aate hai
 In this case, the magnetic needle boxes are positioned in a depressed position at the center of the coil and also see that both ends of the indicator are located at 0 ° - 0 °
 Now connect the two connective screws of the dielectric to that circuit
 In which the current flows
 urdhwadhar kundali main dhara ke pravaahit hote hi, ek chumbakeey kshetra utpann ho jaataa he, jo parthiv kshaitij chumbakeey kshetra se samakon banaata he
 Due to both of those magnetic fields, two opposing forces on the magnetic needle work
 sooyee vikshepit hokar aisi dasha main ruk jaati he jahaan donon balyugmon kaa ghurna baraabar hota he
 If the needle deflection is Q, the current value is determined by the following formula: arthath dharamapi main bahanevaali dhara vikshep kone ke sparshajya ke samaanupati hoti he
 The change of constant dielectric is called multiplier
 parivartan gunak ampiore main napa jaati he
 This is equivalent to an electric current that can produce a 45 degree deflection in the needle of a dielectric
 is prakaar kaa saral sparshajya dharamapi yathesht rup se sookshmagrahi or yatharth nahin hota
 Particularly due to the current, the intensity of the magnetic field is not the same at both poles of the magnetic needle
 is kaaran dharaman main truti ho jaati he, kyonki sutara isi par nirbhar he ki donon dhruvon par chumbakeey kshetra ek sa ho
 Therefore, based on this principle, a second thermometer was called, Helmholts galvanometer
 is dharamapi main yah truti nahin hoti or yah saral sparshajya dharamapi se adhik sookshmagrahi hota he
 It consists of circular coils on two vertical structures of non-magnetic material
 unke kendron ke bich kii duuri unke ardhavyas ke baraabar hoti he
 The magnetic needle box is placed exactly on the horizontal axis of both the coils
 donon kundaliyon ke taar is prakaar jod die jate hai ki jab unamem dhara pravaahit ho tab donon se utpann chumbakeey kshetra ek hi disha main hon
 In this case, the magnetic field produced by the ground near the magnetic needle becomes more intense and it can also be proved that the intensity of this field remains the same at both ends of the needle
 is parivartan ke falswaroop yah dharamapi adhik sookshmagrahi or yatharth ho jaataa he
 Before measuring the current, it is necessary to horizontal the plane of the needle box and the vertical coils in the magnetic meridian
 is samanjan ke baad jab dharamapi kii kundaliyon main dhara pravaahit kii jaati he or chumbakeey sooyee main kone kaa vikshep hota he, tab dhara kaa maan nimna sutara se gyaat hota he : g is called the change multiplier of Helmholt's photometer
 yah dharamapi bhi yathesht rup se sookshmagrahi nahin hota
 a new theory is used to make more sensitive perforators
 vah yah he ki yadi parthiv chumbakeey kshetra kaa prabhaav chumbakeey sooyee par kam kar diya jaae, to kisi bhi dhara ke kaaran chumbakeey sooyee main pehle se adhik vikshep hoga, arthath yantra adhik sookshmagrahi ho jayega
 This is called the principle of inertial pairing
 yadi do lagbhag baraabar chumbakeey ghurna vaale chumbakon ko ek drudh chad se aisa joda jaae ki ve ek duusare ke samaantar hon or unke vipareet dhruv paas paas hon, to unhen asthaitik yugma kehete hai
 In this pair, opposite poles of both magnets are close by, hence the effect of earth magnetic field has little effect on this pair
 taar kii kundali yaa kundaliyaan ek chumbak yaa donon chumbak ke chaaron ore is prakaar lapeti jaati hai ki unamem dhara bahane par chumbakon par ek hi disha main balyugma lage
 In this case if there is also a low current in the coil, there is more deflection in the magnetic pair
 is prakaar ke dharamapi ati sookshmagrahi hote hai
 If this magnetic pair is hung by a spindleless pendant and a small mirror is attached to this pendant, a very small deflection can be measured by the light beam
 prakaash kii kirane lamp se chalakar dharamapi ke darpan se paravartit hokar ek lens dwaara scale par focus main aati hai
 When there is a deflection in the magnetic pair due to current flow and the mirror rotates by angle Q, the reflected light rays rotate at angle 2Q and transfer to the lightpoint on the scale
 is vidhi se sooyee kaa ati sookshm vikshep napa ja saktaa he or iske falswaroop is dharamapi se ati sookshm dhara naapi ja sakati he
 The inertial magnetic pair has been used in many different types of currents
 kelvin dharamapi, pashen dharamapi or broka dharamapi inke kuch udhaaharan hai
 a current of 10-12 amperes can be measured from these currents
 jalchumbak dharamapi, vishesh kar asthaitik dharamapi, atyam sookshmagrahi hote hai, parantu inkaa prayog asuvidhajanak hota he
 They are also temporary
 yahi kaaran he ki ve bahut kam prayukt hote hai
 Most chalkandi dharampati is used, as they are permanent, simple and convenient in addition to being sufficiently sensitive

 lekin isi jagah ek badi vicitra baat hoti he
 Nakula and Sahadeva are seen a bull away from the Pandavas

 Starting with minor incidents, big storms arise in national life
 ek kshudra vritti kii lobhi stri se raashtra-nayika main jalpa kii parinti premchand kii kalam kii kalaatmakataa kii paraakaashtha he
 It has two stories - one related to Prayag and the other to Kolkata
 donon kathanak jalpaki madhyasthata dwaara jod die gayi hai
 The plot lacks unnecessary events and elaborations
 prayag ke chote se gaanv ke jameendaar ke muqataar mahashay dinadayal or maanaki kii iklauti putree jalpa ko bachapan se hi aabhushanon, visheshat: chandrahaar kii laalasaa lag gayi thi
 She dreamed that Chandrahar would surely come for her at the time of marriage
 jab uskaa vivaah kachhari main naukar munshi dayanath ke bekaar putr ramanath se hua to chadhaave main or gahane to the, chandrahaar na tha
 This frustrated Jalpa
 dinadayal or dayanath donon ne apni- apni bisaat se zyaada vivaah main kharch kiya
 While living in the court, Dayanath had turned his back on earning bribe
 putr ke vivaah main ve karz se lad gayi
 Dayanath also wanted to offer Chandrahar but his proposal was rejected by his wife Jageshwari
 jalpa kii ek sakhi shahzadi use chandrahaar praapt karne ke liye or uttejit karti he
 Jalpa went to her in-laws with Chandrahar's take
 ghar kii haalat to khasta thi, kintu ramanath ne jalpa ke saamne apane gharaane kii badi shaan maar rakhi thi
 When the father asks to bring some jewels of the Jalpa secretly to pay off the debt, Ramanath after some mental struggle secretly picks up the ark of the jewelery and gives it to him and pretends to be stolen from the Jalpa, but his fraudulent behavior He has self-aggrandizement, especially when he loves his wife dearly
 jalpa kaa jivan to kshubdh ho uthta he
 Now Ramanath is worried about the job
 ve apane shatranj ke saathi vidhur or chungi main naukari karne vaale ramesh babu kii sahaayta se chungi main tees rupee kii masik naukari paa jate hai
 He tells Jalpa his salary is forty rupees
 isi samay jalpa ko apni mata kaa bheja hua chandrahaar miltaa he, kintu dayaa main diya hua daan samajhakar vah use sweekaar nahin karti
 Now Ramanath is encouraged to make jewelry for Jalpa
 is hausale ko ve saraafon ke karz se lad jane par bhi puraa he
 Ratan, the wife of Indubhushan advocate, loves Jadapa bracelets very well
 vaise hi kangan laane ke liye vah ramanath ko 600 rupee detii he
 Saraf refuses to lend the bracelet to Ramanath by depositing these rupees in the loan account
 ratan kanganon ke liye baraabar takaaza karti rahati he
 At the end she asks to get her money back
 uske rupee waapas karne ke khyaal se ramanath chungi ke rupee hi ghar le aate hai
 In his absence, when Ratan comes to ask for his money, Jalpa picks up the same rupees
 ghar aane par jab ramanath ko pataa laga to unhen badi chintaa hui
 He could be punished for embezzlement
 sari paristhiti kaa spashtikaran karte hue unhone apni patni ke naam ek patr likhaa
 They were thinking about giving it to their wife or not, that they get the letter to Jalpa
 use patr padhate dekhakar unhen itani aatm- glani hoti he ki ve ghar se bhaag jate hai jalpa apane gahane bechakar chungi ke rupee lautaa detii he
 The story then turns to Calcutta
 kalkatte main ramanath apane hitaishi devidin khatic ke yahan kuch dinon tak gupt rup se rahane ke baad chaay kii dukaan khol lete hai
 They hide their reality
 ek din jab ve naatak dekhakar laut rahe the, police unhen shubahe main pakad leti he
 In panic Ramanath narrates the whole story about his embezzlement etc
 pulisavaale apni tahakikat dwaara unhen nirdosh pate hue bhi nahin chhodte or unhen krantikariyon par chal rahe ek muqadamein ke gavaah ke rup main pesh kar dete hai
 Jail- Being scared of life, Ramanath agrees to policemen
 police ne unhen ek bangle main bade aaraam se rakhaa or zohara naamak ek veshya unke manoranjan ke liye niyukt kii gayi
 On the other hand, in consultation with Jalpa Ratan publishes a chess-related advertisement of Rs
 50 / -
 jis vyakti ne vah vigyaapan jeeta, vah ramanath hi the or isse jalpa ko maaloom ho gaya ki ve kalkatte main hai
 While searching, she reaches Devidin Khatik and tries unsuccessfully to get Ramanath out of the police vicious cycle
 ratan bhi unheen dinon apane buudhe pati kaa ilaaj karaane ke liye kalkatte aati he
 After the death of her husband she does not appear to hesitate in assisting Jalpa
 krantikariyon ke viruddh gavaahi dene ke pashchaat unhen jalpa kaa ek patr mila, jisane unke bhav badal diye
 He revealed the whole reality to the judge, which led him to believe that innocent people have been punished
 jaj ne apana pehla nirnay waapas le liya
 Ramanath, Jalpa, Zohra etc
 came back and started living near Prayag
 jalpa ke kaaran ramanath main aatm- sammaan kaa phir se udai ho jaataa he
 Zohra Vaishya - Leaving Life and wearing a service - fast
 ramanath or jalpa bhi seva- maarg kaa anusaran karte hai
 Zohra captivated everyone with his service, self-sacrifice and simple nature
 ratan mrityu ko praapt hui
 Once drowned in the Ganges near Prayag, it was swept away while saving the passenger
 ramanath ne koshish kii ki use bachaane liye aage bad jaay
 Jalpa also jumped into the water
 ramanath aage na bad sake
 One power pulled forward, one back
 aage kii shakti main anuraag tha, niraashaa thi, balidaan tha
 The bandage stopped
 kalkatte main johra vilaas kii vastu thi
 He used to behave like a creature in Prayag
 dayanath or rameshwari ko yah kah kar shant kar diya gaya tha ki vah devidin kii vidhwaa bahu he
 The flame of self-purification was illuminated in Zohra
 apni ksheen aashaa leye ramanath or jalpa ghar laut gayi
 a picture of Zohra used to stand before his eyes

 In the language of Africa, "aparthid" literally means separation or seclusion
 yah niti san 1994 main samaapt kar di gayi
 Nelson Mandela fought a lot against this, for which he was kept in jail for a long time
 dakshin africa main rahane vaale dach mul ke shwet nagarikon kii bhashaa africans main 'aparthid' kaa shabdic arth he, parthaky yaa alahadaapan

 Under Malan, apartheid policies against blacks and in favor of Shwetangs were legalized and institutionalized

 The slogans given by Malan during the election gave the aparthide meaning of apartheid

 Apartheid then dominated the political, social and economic life of South Africa for the next half century
 usne antarrashtriya sambandhon ko bhi prabhavit kiya
 Apartheid came to an end in the nineties with the establishment of democratic rule of majority blacks under the leadership of the African National Congress and Nelson Mandela
 dakshin africa ke sandarbh main nasli bhedbhaav kaa itihaas bahut purana he
 It begins with Dutch colonists establishing Cap Town as their refreshment station
 asia main upnivesh kaayam karne ke liye dach upniveshvaadi isi raste se jate the
 At the same time, Europeans living among the African population of the region began to see themselves as rulers of black Africans
 shaskaon or shasiton ke bich shreshthata or nimnata kaa bhed karne ke liye kaalon ko europiyanon se haath bhar dur rakhane kaa aagrah panapana zaruri tha
 The paradox of the situation was that blacks also had an intimate presence in the lives of white European owners
 isi antarangta ke parinamswaroop ek mili-juli nasl kii rachana hui jo ‘ashwet’ kehalaae
 Although the apartheid law was enacted in 1948, white governments in South Africa continued to adopt a discriminatory attitude against the Blacks

 But all the facilities were available to a handful of white workers

 Social and economic conflict began to be interpreted in the light of economic aspects

 At the same time Britain tried unsuccessfully to form a federation with the Boer republics of Dutch origin in the southern part of the African continent
 iske baad dakshin africa ganraajya ke mukaable angrezon ko apane pehle yuddh main paraajay naseeb hui
 In Witwatersrand, gold mining by German and British capital jointly made the situation more serious

 They had to pay tax on the dynamite used in mining
 kruger kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki in videshi khan maalikon or unke khanij campon ke pradooshan se boar samaaj ko bachaaya janaa chahie
 On the other hand, Cecil Rhodes, who invested in mining and had been the Prime Minister of Cap Colony and his allies, aimed to expand British influence
 is pratiyogita ke garbh se jo yuddh niklaa use boar waar ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The two sides of this war, which continued from 1899 to 1902, were pro-apartheid Europeans, but black soldiers were being filled as fodder in the cannons of both sides

 With the ruling of the National Party committed to apartheid in 1948, the ANC entered into an alliance with the Indian Congress, the Colored People's Congress and the White Congress of Damocrates

 In the seventies, liberals working among whites also waged a front against apartheid and young Africans began to show a tendency in favor of an ideology that elevated black consciousness
