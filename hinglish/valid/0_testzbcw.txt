 After the American War of Independence, America was established on the world map as an independent nation and replaced the federal governance system by creating the world's first written constitution
 is swatantraaa sangram main sabhi america rajyon ne ekajute hokar upniveshwaad ke viruddh sangharsh kiya tha kintu 1860 ke dashak main america rajyon ke bich hi grih-yuddh chhid gaya
 Some historians believe that the seeds of civil war were contained in the American freedom struggle itself, while some consider civil war as capitalist movement and some historians have attributed slavery to civil war
 america grihayuddh ke nimnlikhit kaaran the- The situation in the northern states of the United States was relatively strong demographically and economically
 sangh ke 34 rajyon main se 23 rajya uttar main sammilit the or desh kii kul jansankhya kaa 2 / 3 bhaag uttar main rahata tha, jisamen daason kii sankhya bahut kam thi
 Industry was predominant in the northern states
 udyogon main sooti, oonee vastra, chamade ke saamaan aadi vasteen bade paimaane par utpaadit hoti thi
 In these factories, labor was produced by machines, so slaves and slaves did not have much importance here
 duusari taraf america ke dakshini rajyon kaa aarthik jivan krishi par aadhaarit tha or krishi main yantron kaa bahut adhika prayog nahin hota tha
 Hence the peasants of these states depended on the labor of slaves for farming
 dakshin main kapaas, ganna evam tambaaku kii kheti bahut bade paimaane par hoti thi jisamen das majdoor ke rup main kaary karte the
 Therefore, the society of the south was completely dependent on slaves
 is tarah dakshini rajya uttari evam pashchimi bhaagon se apni jin visheshtaon kii vajah se alag pahachaanaa jaataa tha ve thi, vahaan prachlit prachlit das vyavastha or bagan vyavastha
 The southern states — stretching from Virginia through South Carolina to Georgia as a strip
 is prakaar aarthik vishmata ke kaaran uttari evam dakshini rajyon ke aarthik jivan, raajnneetik vichaardhaara or saamaajik str main bahut bada matbhed tha
 State industries in North America were predominant, so budding entrepreneurs there sought protection to avoid foreign competition
 unke hiton ko dhyaan main rakh america sangh dwaara udyogon ko sangrakshan diya gaya
 But this step was objected to by the southern states
 kyonki sangrakshan kii niti ke kaaran ab unhen vinirmit vasteen apekshaakrit mahange mulya par milti thi
 Therefore, they felt that the Union was being used for the interests of North America and a view of neglect towards the southern states
 america ke uttari rajyon main daason kii aarthik jivan main koi nirnaayak jivan main koi nirnaayak bhoomika nahin thi
 Therefore, the importance of slaves was secondary to them
 On the other hand, slavery in the southern states of America had dissolved in life
 dakshini rajyon ke maamlen main das pratha kaa mudda sadaiv samvedansheel bana rahaa
 Whenever other states arose to implement the ban on slavery in these southern states, these states considered it an attack on their sovereignty
 vastutah uttari rajyon main daastaa ko maanavtaa par kalank ke rup main dekha gaya or ise samaapt karne ke kii maang jor shor uthaai gai
 This anti-slave sentiment was raised in the medium of newspapers
 duusari taraf dakshini rajyon ke liye daason ko mudda laabhpradata se judaa hua tha
 He argued that there was no fear of labor organizations, strikes etc
 in the slavery system and that they provide more facilities to slaves than workers of northern states
 is manovruti evam tarkon ke aadhaar par dakshini rajyon ne das pratha ko aavashyak bataaya
 Slave trade was abolished in North America and slavery ceased in the north to the southern border of Pennsylvania
 is seemaa rekha ko “mesum-dikson” seemaa kaha jaataa tha
 Now America was expanding into the western regions and new territories were being included in the United States
 aise main yah prashn uth khadaa hua ki in rajyon ko das rajya ke rup main yaa swatantra rajya ke rup main shaamil kiya jaae
 This issue was also important because in the constitution it was accepted that slaves were also counted in the federal administration, but the population of slaves was represented at an average of 3 / 5 ie if the population of slaves would be 500 then consider it 300 Representation began to be given
 is tarah das rajyon kii sankhya main vruddhi ho jane se vyavasthapika main das rajyon kaa varchasv bad jane kaa khatra tha
 Therefore, in the context of the merger of the new states, North America wanted to include it as a free state, while the southern states as a slave state
 yah vivaad mizori rajya ke vilay ko lekar or bhi gaharaa gaya
 So in 1820, the Missouri-settlement was concluded with the arbitration of Henry Clay
 iske tahat mizori ke das rajya ke rup main sangh main sammilit kar liya gaya or yah kaha gaya ki 36030' akshansh ke uttar vaale kshetra louiciana main das pratha jari nahin rahegi
 This was followed by a proposal to merge Texas into the Union
 ant main texas das rajya ke rup main sangh main 1845 main shaamil ho gaya
 Then the issue of California was disputed and California was finally annexed as an independent state in 1850
 dakshini rajyon main is par ugr virodh jataayaa
 Now to satisfy them, a "fugitive slave" law was brought under which the runaway slave could be caught again
 is kanoon kaa uttari rajyon ne virdohi kiya kyonki ve bhagode daason ko sharan dete the
 But the question of the merger of Kansas and Nebraska in 1854 deepened the controversy
 vastutah ye donon rajya 30 degree 30 minute ke uttar main sthit the ore mizori samjhaute ke anusaar inhen swatantra rajya ke rup main sammilit kiya janaa tha kintu stephen duglas naamak raajnneetijna ke prayaas se in rajyon ko das rajya ke rup main shaamil kar liya gaya
 In this way, the question of the merger of states widened the gap between the northern and southern states
 1860 i
 main republican ummidavaar abraham linkan kii vijay hui or 1861 main raashtrapati ke pad par asin hua
 The Republican Party criticized slavery and believed in the free labor ideology

 He felt that this victory was not compatible with the economic interests of the South
 atah dakshin ke rajyon main pehali pratikriya carolina rajya dwaara kii gayi or usne sangh se alag hone kii ghoshnaa kar di
 By February 1861, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Lulciana, and Texas also disbanded the Union and appointed Jefferson Davis as their President, and the Civil War began, with the bombing of Sumter's Fort from South Carolina as the Union
 Waged war against dakshini rajyon dwaara sangh se alag ho jane ke kaaran ek mahatvapurn sanvaidhanik prashn khadaa ho gaya ki kya dakshini raj ko sangh se alag hone kaa adhikaar he? linkan ne raashtrapati pad par nirvachan ke pashchaat spasht rup se ghoshnaa kii ki sanyukt rajya america ke rup main jo sangh sthapit kiya gaya tha vah akhandaneey or shaashwat he, uski akhandaneeyata ko kisi prakaar nasht nahin hone diya jayega
 The framers of the US Constitution have not given any state the right to secede from the Union
 linkan ne ghoshit kiya ki "agar ham sabhi daason ko mukt kar sangh ko bachaa sake to ham aisa karenge agar ham daason ko mukt kiye bina sangh ko bachaa sake to ham aisa karenge or agar kuch daason ko mukt kar tathaa kuch anya ko mukt nahin karke sangh ko bachaa sake to ham vah bhi karenge
 "in this way Lincoln attempted to preserve the Union
 yuddh ke dauraan usne kootnithik kushalta ke jariye dakshini rajyon kaa videshon se sambandh banane nahin diya
 He organized the forces and broke the challenge of armed struggle of the south
 prarambh se hi usne senaaon kaa mukhya lakshya dakshini pradesh par adhikaar karnaa nahin varan parisangh kii senaaon kaa vistaar karnaa bataaya
 In 1861, Lincoln abolished the slave system and invited him to join the national armies
 kintu iskaa uddeshy dakshini rajyon ko nasht karnaa nahin varan sangh ko banaae rakhana hi tha
 He believed that the declaration of the freedom of slaves would lead to rebellion of slaves in the southern states and that they would not get the help of slaves in war
 antat linkan ke prayaason evam kutniti kushalta ke jariye uttari rajyon kii jeet hui ore isi ke saath 1865 i

 Lincoln made America a truly united national
 daastaa kaa unmoolan kar samaaj ko navajyoti di tathaa america raajnneetik tantra ko majbood banaaya
 But after the civil war, it could not advance America because it strengthened the political system
 parantu grihayuddh ke pashchaat america ko vah aage nahin badha sakaa kyaaki 15 apairal 1865 ko jon viscus booth dwaara uski hatya kar di gai
 The American Civil War served as a turning point in the history of the United States

 But it is also true that chaos and disorganization were similar to a surgical therapy followed by the creation of a healthy, developed and integrated United States
 isi sandarbh main pro
 alson ne kaha ki "yuddh ek shalya chikitsa thi vah dukhadaayi hote hue bhi sanyukt rajya ke liye ankaha arshivaad ban gai
 " grihayuddh ne rashtriya or kshetreey shakti sambandhon main naatakeey parivartan laa diya
 Resolved the dispute over the rights of the long-standing provincial and federal states
 dakshini rajyon ke aatmasamarpan ke pashchaat unhen sangh main punah shaamil kiya gaya
 This meant that the union of states would remain undone and that the right to separatism would never arise again in the future
 vastutah grihayuddh ke parinaam ne is sanvaidhanik prashn ko hal kar diya ki rajyon ko sangh se alag hone kaa adhikaar nahin he
 In this way the principle of the "indestructible Union of Indestructible States" mentioned in the constitution was confirmed
 ab raajnneetik rup se america ko vaastavik sanyukt raashtra kaa rup pradaan kiya gaya
 An important achievement of civil war in the social sphere was the abolition of slavery from America
 ab daason ko swatantra kar diya gaya or unhen matdaan kaa adhikaar de diya gaya
 With the emancipation of slavery, they got the freedom and mobility through which they could earn money by working in the markets

 Secondly, the trend of becoming rich soon developed after the chaos that arose due to the war going on for a long time

 The Civil War was seen as a socio-economic catalyst power making America a major industrial nation

 Industrial capitalism quadrupled after the Civil War
 jin puunjipatiyon ne yuddh main dhan lagaakar or sena ke liye maal kii aapurti kaa theka lekar apaar laabh kamaaya unhone is dhan kaa sadupyog raashtra kii prakritik smapda ke dohan main kiya
 The socio-economic changes that resulted from the war all proved to be helpful in America's industrial development

 She says that men have created false rules and laws around women, keeping them in the assurance that men are superior in their place
 lekhika kaa maananaa tha kii aisa karke purush ne striyon kii pareshaaniyon ko samajhane se haath dho liye the or un ke jhuthe dhakoslon ne striyon ko samaaj main hameshaa unke neeche band ke rakhane main unki sahaayta kii hai
 Beauvoir believes that the same pressure has been seen in other parts of the society, for example, in society, fanatical and petty-minded hypocrites have spread many quarrels and discriminations about color, caste, and religion
 par unka maananaa he ki sastri jaati ko jitna samaaj ke itihaas main dabaaya gaya he, vaisaa kisi dharm va jaati ko nahin dabaaya gaya hai
 By keeping women below themselves, hypocritical men have not maintained their high place in society
 apni pustak main beovoir ne aise hi kai vichaaron ko ujagar kii he, jo samaaj kii reet athwa niyamon ko chunauti detii hai
 They have said that women have been considered weak and physically and mentally abnormal and for this reason women have not got proper opportunities anywhere
 nari ko hameshaa yah aashwaasan diya gaya hai ki ve kamazor hai or unhen sthir va saamaanya rahane ke liye purusho ke maarg-darshan par chalanaa chahie
 Before the publication of The Second Sex, there were never any discussions in France about female existentialism, and women never had any complaint about the laws of society
 parantu bauaar ne vichaar dharaa badal daali
 Their female and male caste equality in society draws attention to two issues: One, how physical abnormalities have caused men to rise above and beyond women
 doosraa yah ki kis tarah shaareerik asaamanyataon par bahes va soch-vichaar karne se yah pataa chalata he ki shaareerik asaamanyata asal main prakruti kii kriya he or isamen purusho kaa koi haath nahin
 Therefore, the reason for the physical abnormality causing social inequality in men and women is meaningless and foolish
 yahan beovoir plato ke vichaar dharaa ko nakaarte hue kahati he ki kisi vyakti kaa ling ek ghatana he jisapar us vyakti kaa koi jor nahin hota hai
 Therefore, no distinction should be made between men and women
 nari astitv ke liye beovoir ne kai yogadan kiye hai, parantu phir bhi kabhi beovoir ne swayan ko ek kattar stri adhikaaravaadi nahin kaha
 But Beauvoir did not declare herself a feminist rightist in 1972 after the 1960s and 1970s feminist fronts

 namakan prakriya : From the theoretical point of view, the personal description of 'how translation happens' is the process of translation
 bhashaa vyavhaar kii ek vishisht vidha ke rup main anuwaad prakriya kaa spashtikaran ek aisi drushti kii apeksha rakhata he, jisamen anuwaad kaary sambandhi bahirlakshi paristhatiyon or bhashaa-sanrachana evam bhashaa-prayog sambandhi antarlakshi sthitiyon kaa santulan ho 
 It is considered a feature of modern translation theory to present this explanation in the context of theoretical formats related to the above situations
 tadnusaar chintan ke ang ke rup main anuwaad kii ikai, anuwaad kaa pathak, or kala, kaushal evam vigyaan kii drushti se anuwaad ke swaroop par drushtipaat ke saath saath anuwaad kii prakriya kaa vishad vivaran kiya jaataa he
 The message is usually translated: so the unit of translation is also considered as the message
 vibhinn prakaar ke anuwaadon main sandesh kii abhivyanjak bhashik ikai kaa aakaar bhi bhinn-bhinn rahata he
 Mechanical translation has a form or unit of translation, but in human translation the unit has a larger size
 isi prakaar aashu maukhik anuwaad main yah ikai ek vaakya hoti he, to likhit anuwaad main ikai kaa aakaar vaakya se bada hota he 
 In human translation of the written medium, a unit of translation is considered a text
 anuvadak paath str ke sandesh kaa anuwaad karte hai 
 The size range of a text can be anything from a sentence to an entire book or a specific group of books, but a message is expressed in its fullness, it is necessary
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisi saarvajanik soochna yaa nirdesh kaa ek vaakya hi purna sandesh ban saktaa he
 Such as 'entry is forbidden'
 duusari ore 'rangabhumi' yaa 'kamayani' kii puri pustak hi paath str kii ho sakati he
 From the point of view of physical convenience, translators do translation work by dividing the text into logical sections, such sections can be called translator text or they are also called text in the immediate context
 inhen anuvadak anuwaad kii taatkaalik ikai kehete hai tathaa sampoorn paath ko anuwaad kii purna ikai
 Knowledge of the structure of the text is considered to be particularly helpful in understanding the translation process
 paath sanrachana ke teen aayam maane gayi hai - pathgat, pathshavarti tathaa anya pathparak 
 According to the belief of signology, all three have synchronous existence and these three are interdependent
 pathgat aayam paath kaa aantarik aayam he, jisamen uske bhashaa paksh kaa grahan hota he 
 In both cases, legibility is the intrinsic quality of the text
 paath kii pathgat sanrachana ke do paksh hai - Supersession of units falling under sentence, bhashaa-vishleshan ke vibhinn staron par, anubhav hone vaali sansakti 
 Units of sentence, sentence, phrase, phrase, phrase and form are combined in this phrase, but from the point of view of the text, it is important that the sentences of a text containing more than one sentence are coordinated by interjectors such that, throughout the text The quality of culture begins to be experienced
 parantu sansakti tatparynt simit nahin 
 We can also experience it at different levels of text analysis
 tadnusaar sandarbhagat sansakti, shabdagat sansakti, or vyakaranik sansakti kii baat kii jaati he 
 The textual dimension consists of the content of the text, its specific genre, its socio-cultural aspect, the specific intent of the text at the time of the text, or the expressive intent of the writer, the social personality of the intended reader and its need, etc
 pathshavarti aayam ke uparyukt paksh paraspar is prakaar subaddh rahete hai ki sampoorn paath ekanvit ikai ke rup main anubhav hota he 
 It is clearly believed that the textual dimension is the expression of the textual dimension itself and the textual dimension is disciplined by the textual dimension
 is prakaar ye donon anyonyashrith hai 
 There is also a difference in the depth of legibility from textual discourse - the experienced reader draws from his insightful intuition
 tadnusaar, saahitiyik rachana main sugathanaatmakataa kii jo gahanta uplabdh hoti he vah antim vivaran main anubhoot nahin hoti
 The other textual dimension of text structure discusses the relationship of a specific text to other texts with similar or different contexts
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vastra ke vigyaapan kii bhashaa kii, prashaadhan saamagree ke vigyaapan kii bhashaa se prayog style kii drushti se jo samanta hogi tathaa bankig seva ke vigyaapan se jo bhinnata hogi wo sambandh par charchaa kii jaati he
 In this, there is a discussion to know the different aspects of the thinking process related to the major formats of the translation process
 prarupakaar praayah apni anuwaad paristhitiyon tathaa tatsambandhi chintan se prerit hone ke kaaran prakriya ke kuch hi pakshon par vishesh bal de pate hai 
 This inferiority in all roundness is fulfilled in such a way that sufficient information is available regarding the prudential aspect
 is drushti se bathget drashtavy he 
 Two motivational elements are primarily considered behind the design of the translation process - the training of human translators and the mechanical aspect of machine translation
 in donon kii aavashyaktaaon se prerit hokar anuwaad prakriya ke saiddhanthik spashtikaran prastut kiye gaye 
 The translation process formats are often driven by the need for training human translators only
 anuprayogtmak aayam main inaki upyogita spasht kii jaati he 
 The focal point of the translation process is to introduce the translation of the original language text into the target language
 yah prakriya ekapaksheeya hoti he - mulbhasha se lakshyabhasha main 
 But this condition of languages is interchangeable - which is the primary language in the first time, it can be the target language in the second time
 is prakriya ko sampreshan siddhanth se samarthit maanchitr dwaara bhi samajhaayaa jaataa he, jo nimna prakaar se he : Opinion of the speaker / writer → expression of the original language → the text of the language → the response of the first audience / reader → the sense of the translator → the expression of the target language is praaroop ke anusaar anuwaad prakriya ke kul aath sopan ho sakate hai 
 The idea that arises in the mind of the writer or speaker takes the shape of the text of the native language by tying it into the expression conventions of the native language, thereby first reflecting the response of the speaker / writer in the mind of the listener or reader
 tatpashchaat anuvadak apni pratibha, bhashagyaan or vishyagyaan ke anusaar mulbhasha ke paath kaa arth samajhakar lakshyabhasha kii abhivyakti roodhiyon kaa paalan karte hue lakshyabhasha ke paath kaa sarjan karata he, jise doosraa pathak grahan karata he 
 It is clear from this interpretation that the number 5, ie the translator's numbers 3, 4 and 1 are related to these three
 vah mulbhasha ke paath kaa arthbodh karte hue pehle pathak ke samaan aacharan karata he, or mulbhasha kaa paath kyonki vaktaa / lekhak ke vichaar kaa pratik hota he, atah anuvadak usase bhi jud jaataa he 
 The same format has also been presented by scholars from time to time
 udaaran ke liye naida, newmark, or bathget ke anshadaanon kii charchaa kii jaati he
 According to Nida, the process by which these translation synonyms are determined has two forms: direct and indirect
 in donon main aadharbhoot antar he 
 Translation synonyms are fixed in the target language of available linguistic units at the level of the external structure of the original text according to the format of the direct process; And the translation process is a serial process, in which every piece of the original text is translated
 is prakriya main ek madhyavarti sthiti bhi hoti he jisamen ek nirvishesh or saarvbhaum bhashik sanrachana rahati he; iskaa keval saiddhanthik mahatva he 
 According to the recognition of this format, the translator takes the message of the original language text directly into the target language; In both these situations, it remains at the level of the outer-text structure of the original language and target language text
 anuwaad-paryaayon ke chayan or prastutikaran kaa kaary ek swachaalit prakriya ke samaan hota he 
 Nida explains this through a diagram: k xxrep 16 - xxrep 16 - kha In this, 'a' is the root language, 'b' is the target language, and '' is the intermediate structure, which is the same for both languages and makes translation possible; Here the two languages become associated with each other in such a way that their own specialness disappears for some time
 paroksh prakriya ke praaroop main dharna yah he ki anuvadak paath kii bahyatleey sanrachana paryant simit rahakar aavashyaktaanusaar, api tu praayah sadaa, paath kii gahan sanrachana main bhi jaataa he or phir lakshyabhasha main upyukt anuwaad paryaay prastut karata he 
 In fact in this format, the direct process format described earlier becomes an implication; There is no conflict between the two
 pratyaksh prakriya praaroop kii yah niyam he ki anuwaad kaary bahyatleey sanrachana ke str par hi ho jaataa he, jabaki paroksh prakriya ke anusaar anuwaad kaary praayah paath kii gahan sanrachana ke madhyam se hota he, yadhyapi is baat kii sadaa sambhaavna rahati he ki bhashaa main mulbhasha ke anek anuwaad paryaay bahyatleey sanrachana ke str par hi mil jaaen
 Nida is a supporter of the indirect process format
 nimnlikhit aarekh dwaara ve ise spasht karne kaa prayaas karte hai - y = deeply analyzed text of native language r = lakshyabhasha main sashakrant gahanstareey paath According to Nida, the translation process actually has three steps - anuvadak sarvapratham mulbhasha ke paath kaa vishleshan karata he; paath kii vyakaranik sanrachana tathaa shabdon evam shabd shrinkhalaon kaa arthgat vishleshan kar vah mulpath ke sandesh ko grahan karata he 
 For this, he appropriately applies the techniques of language analysis based on language theory
 visheshtah asaamaanya rup se jatil tathaa deergh or anekarth vaakyon or vaakyanshon / padabandhon ke arthbodhan main ho sakane vaali kathinaaiyon kaa hal karne main mulpath kaa vishleshan sahaayak rahata he
 The message transitions into the target language after it becomes meaningful
 yah prakriya anuvadak ke mastishk main hoti he 
 In this, the goal of the text is set synonymously, and there is harmony between the two languages in different levels and categories
 ant main anuvadak mulbhasha ke sandesh ko lakshya bhashaa main uski sanrachana evam prayog niyamon tathaa vidhaagat roodhiyon ke anusaar is prakaar punargathit karata he ki vah lakshyabhasha ke pathak ko swaabhaavik prathit hota he yaa kam se kam aswabhaavik prathit nahin hota 
 In the context of clarification of the translation process, Nida has presented a definite language theory and framework for analysis of the text
 unke anusaar bhashaa ke do pakshon kaa vishleshan apekshit he - vyakaran tathaa shabdaarth 
 Nida grammar is not limited only to constitutive analysis of sentences or lower categories - clauses, passages, etc
 unke anusaar vyakaranik gathan bhi ek prakaar se arthvan hota he 
 For example, there is not only a constitutional difference between the participle structure and the passive / emotional structure, but also a difference of meaning
 is sambandh main unhone anekarth sanrachanaon kii ore vishesh rup se dhyaan khinchaa he
 For example, 'this is the picture of Ram' This sentence can have the following three meanings: yah chitra ram ne banaaya he
 Ram is inscribed in this picture
 yah chitra ram kii sampatti he
 These three sentences are, according to Nida, bijavakya or subbivakavya, which are determined by the method of successive conversion
 bahyastareey sanrachana par in teenon vaakyon kaa pratyakshikaran 'yah ram kaa chitra he' is ek hi vaakya ke rup main hota he 
 Nida described the above conversion method in detail
 unki roopaantaran vishyak dharna chamski ke roopaantaran-prajnak vyakaran kii dharna ke samaan kathor tathaa gathnabaddh nahin, api tu anuprayog kii prakruti tathaa uske uddeshy ke anuroop lacheelee tathaa antargyanmalak he 
 In the same way, he has done a descriptive analysis of two categories of semantics - speech and target - satire
 yah dhyaan dene yogya he ki, naida ne vishleshan kii uparyukt pranali ko mulbhasha paath ke arthbodhan ke saadhan ke rup main prastut kiya he 
 His emphasis has been on understanding the meaning of the text as fully and as accurately as possible
 unki pranali bible evam uske sadrush anya pracheen granthon kii bhashaa ke vishleshnatmak arthbodhan ke liye upyukt mana jaataa he; yadhyapi uskaa prayog anya or aadhunik bhashaabhedon ke paathon ke arthbodhan ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he 
 The goal of arthabodh with the help of analysis is the central step in the translation process in the language
 anuwadakaarya main anuvadak ko vishleshan or punargathan ke do dhruvon ke madhya gati karte rahanaa hota he, parantu yah gati sankraman madhyavarti sopan ke maarg se hoti he, jahaan anuvadak ko punargathan ke sopan ke ansho ko or adhik spashtataa se darshan hota he 
 This process of infection is quick and intuitive in the translator's brain and by its nature
 anuwaad prakriya main anuvadak ke vyaktitv kii sangati is sopan par he 
 The efficiency of language and communication related facts obtained from the analysis, as the translator uses, to establish the appropriate translation-synonym, lies in it
 vishleshan tathaa punargathan ke sopanon par ek anuvadak anya vyaktiyon se bhi kabhi kuch sahaayta le saktaa he, parantu sankraman ke sopan par vah ekaaki hi hota he 
 Two things to consider in terms of transition are the translator's own personality and the transitional harmony between the native language and the target language
 anuvadak ke vyaktitv main uskaa vishyagyaan, bhashagyaan, pratibha, tathaa kalpana in chaar kii vishesh apeksha hoti he 
 However, from the point of view of primacy, talent and imagination have more importance than subject and linguistics, because translation is mainly a practical and functional work
 vishyagyaan tathaa bhashagyaan kii kami ko anuvadak dusron kii sahaayta se bhi puraa kar saktaa he, parantu pratibha or kalpana kii drushti se apane upar hi nirbhar rahanaa hota he 
 Establishing harmony between the native language and the target language is an essential and internal requirement of the translation process
 bhashaantaran main sandesh kaa pratikul rup se prabhavit hona sambhavit rahata he 
 In order to reduce the impact of this adverseness as much as possible, a situation of harmony between the two languages has to be brought in both in terms of meaning and grammar
 muhaavarey evam unka lakshanik prayog, anekarthakata, arth kii saamanyata tathaa vishistataa, aadi anek aise mudde hai jinka saamanjasy karnaa hota he 
 From the grammatical point of view, there are many such things related to proctive-structure and type, syntax-type and post-structure and type, which require adjustment
 udhaaharan ke liye, mulpath main prayukt kisi vishesh antaravakyayojak ke liye lakshyabhasha ke paath main kisi antaravakyayojak kaa prayog apekshit na hona, mulpath kii karmavachi sanrachana ke liye lakshyabhasha main kartruvachya sanrachana kaa upyukt hona vyakaranik samaayojan ke mudde hai 
 As important as the transition step is in terms of translation work, its relatively independent existence in the explanation of the translation process is not as clear compared to the other two steps
 bahudhaa sankraman tathaa punargathan ke sopanon ke antar ko prakriya ke vishadikaran main sthapit karnaa kathin ho jaataa he 
 On the steps of analysis and restructuring, if the translator's responsibility is relatively independent, he or she is in a state of subordination at the step of the transition
 adhik mukhya baat yah he ki, anuvadak ko un sab muddon kii chetana ho jinka upar varnan kiya gaya he 
 If these are considered to be directly useful to the translation-trainee, then they may be considered as natural part of the translation behavior of the habitual translator
 mulpath ke sandesh kaa arthbodh, sankraman ke sopan main se hote hue lakshyabhasha main punargathit hokar anuwaad kaa rup dhaaran karata he 
 The step of reorganization is the step of tangible expression in the target language
 anuwaad prakriya kii jaankaree ke sambandh main anuvaadakon ko punargathan ke sopan par paath ke jin pramukh ayaamon kii upyuktata par dhyaan dena abhisht he ve hai - 1) Grammatical structure and type, 2) shabdakram, 3) co-operation, 4) bhashabhed tathaa shailigat pratimaan 
 The basic criterion for this is the linguistic suitability and naturalness
 in gunon kii nishpatti ke liye kai baar donon bhashaaon main samanta kii sthiti sahaayak hoti he, kai baar asamanta kii 
 For example, it is not necessary that the proper translation-synonym of the target language for the phrase of the original language is a phrase; This structure can also be an entire term; For example, Diploma in translation = translation diploma
 dekhnaa yah hota he ki, lakshyabhasha main sandesh kaa punargathan uparyukt ghatakon kii drushti se upyuktata tathaa swaabhaaviktaa kii sthiti kii nishpatti karen; ve ghatak lakshyabhasha kii 'atmiyata' tathaa parampara ke anuroop hon 
 Certain facts of grammatical structure in the base language may change the form of the target language, although this is not always necessary
 udhaaharan ke liye, angl mulpath kii karmavachi sanrachana "steps have been taken by the Government to meet the situation" ko hindi main karmavachi sanrachana main bhi prastut kiya ja saktaa he, kartruvachya sanrachana main bhi : " sthiti kaa saamana karne ke liye sarkaar dwaara kaarywahi kii gai hai / sthiti kaa saamana karne ke liye sarkaar ne kaarywahi kii hai 
 "but K" presided over the meeting in Hindi for "the meeting was chaired by X" seems appropriate
 aise nirnay punargathan ke str par kiye jate hai 
 The same thing is for co-operation
 sahprayog prayek bhashaa ke apane-apane hote hai 
 In English it is said to take a step, then 'take action' in Hindi
 is udhaaharan main to take kaa anuwaad 'uthaanaa' samajhnaa bhul maani jaaegi : ye donon apni-apni bhashaa main aise shabdic ikaayiyon ke rup main prayukt hote hai, jinhen khandit nahin kiya ja saktaa 
 Under language discrimination, time, place and purposeful language differences are calculated
 tathaapi ek sugathit paath ke str par ye sab shailibhed ke rup main dekhe jate hai 
 For example, when translating Old English works into Hindi, on the restructuring step, the translator must decide which linguistic effects of the target language may be equivalent to the stylistic effects of the text
 is drushti se puraani angreji ke paath kaa puraani hindi main bhi anuwaad upyukt ho saktaa he, aadhunik hindi main bhi 
 The stylistic paradigm is visually explained in two forms: the non-literary genre and the literary genre
 saahityetar style main aupchaarik ke viruddh anaupchaarik tathaa takneekee ke viruddh gaiyr-takneekee, ye do bhed pramukh rup se milte hai 
 In the literary genre, the textual distinctions of the text - prose and verse, etc
 are particularly mentioned
 is drushti se aupchaarik style ke mulpath ko lakshyabhasha main aupchaarik style main hi prastut kiya jaae, yaa mul gadhy rachana ko lakshyabhasha main gadhy ke rup main hi prastut kiya jaae, yah nirnay lakshyabhasha kii parampara par aadhaarit upyuktata ke anusaar karnaa hota he 
 For example, in Indian languages the tradition of poetry is more substantive than prose; Therefore, if there is a pithy interpretation of the original prose text, it may also seem appropriate
 saransh yah ki lakshyabhasha main jo swabhik or upyukt prathit ho tathaa jo lakshyabhasha kii parampara ke anukool ho – swaabhaaviktaa, upyuktata tathaa paramparanuvarthita, ye teenon ek seemaa tak anyonyashrith hai - uske aadhaar par lakshyabhasha main sandesh kaa punargathan hota he 
 How Nida's system works is also explained with the help of the following examples
 saarvajanik soochna ke sandarbh se ek udhaaharan is prakaar he 
 a = No admission ya = Admission is not allowed Su = Access not allowed
 kha = pravesh varjit he / andar aana manaa he 
 According to the above translation, 'A' is the text of the original language which is an example of a language of public instruction
 yah ek alpang vaakya he 
 To clarify its meaning, the translator determines its bijavakya by following the conversion from the method of analysis, this bijavakya is 'Y'; 'A' is derived from it
 sankraman ke sopan par 'ya' samsanrachanaatmak or samanarthak vaakya 'r' he jo purogami roopaantaran dwaara punargathan ke str par 'kha' kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he 
 'B' has two distinctions; Both are considered pure; The difference in them is in terms of style
 ‘pravesh varjit he' main aupchaarikta he tathaa vah sushikshit varg ke upyukt he; 'andar aana manaa he' main anaupchaarikta he or use saamaanya rup se sabhi ke liye or vishesh rup se alpashikshit varg ke liye upyukt mana jaataa he; suchanaatmakataa tathaa aadeshaatmakataa donon main surakshit he 
 Here is the following sentence in administrative English, which is the text and according to the above translation is at the level of 'A': It becomes very inconvenient to move to the section officer's table along with all the relevant papers a number of times during the day in connection with the above mentioned work
 one moves to the section officer's table
 one moves to the section officer's table, with all the relevant papers
 one moves to the section officer's table, with all the relevant papers, a number of times during the day
 one moves to the section officer's table with all the relevant papers, a number of times during the day, in connection will above mentioned work
 In the picture, this sentence is analyzed in two sections
 pehle khand main ise do bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he - ucchtar vaakya tathaa nimnatar vaakya, jinhen sthool rup se vaakya rachana kii paramparaagat kotiyon - mukhya upvakya or ashrith upwakyasmakaksh mana jaataa hai
 The second section analyzes both higher and lower sentences
 ucchtar vaakya ke teen ang hai, jinamein poorak kaa sambandh karta se he; vah karta kaa poorak he 
 In the lower sentence, it is complementary to to move and it is a cognate due to the doer replacing it, because the doer can be a property
 yah samp ek vaakya se vyutpann he jisaki aadharbhoot sanrachana main karta, kriya tathaa teen kriyavisheshkon kii shrinkhalaa dikhaai padati he 
 The explanation of the structure of this basic, inferior sentence has occurred in the passages of the latter
 isamen kriyavisheshkon kaa kramik sangyojan spasht kiya gaya he
 This is the 'Y' level of the process according to Naida as shown in the picture
 tatpashchaat pratyaksh tathaa paroksh anuwaad prakriya praroopon kii tulana kii jaati he
 The following translations of the above sentences can be made according to the direct procedure format: "uparyukt kaary ke sambandh main sabhi sambandhit patron ko lekar anubhag adhikari ke paas din main anek baar janaa asuvidhajanak rahata he" athwa "yah asuvidhajanak he ki uparyukt kaary ke sambandh main sabhi sambandhit patron ko lekar anubhag adhikari ke paas din main anek baar jaaya jaae
 "coming from 'Y' to 'su' is the transition step, on which signs of trying to make a connection between the text and the target language text
 parantu paroksh prakriya praaroop ke anusaar anuvadak uparyukt vishleshan kii vidhi kaa upyog karte hai, or tadnusaar prastut vaakya kaa upyukt anuwaad is prakar ho saktaa he -"uparyukt kaam ke sambandh main saare sambandhit patron ke saath anubhag adhikari ke paas, jo din main kai baar janaa padataa he, usamen badi asuvidha hoti he 
 "this sentence is at the 'B' level and is related to the reorganization step
 ukt anuwaad main kriyavisheshkon kaa sangyojan or mulpath ke nimnatar vaakya kii padbandhaatmak sanrachana - to move to the section officer's table - ke sthaan par anuwaad main kriyavisheshan upvakya kii sanrachana - 'anubhag adhikari ke paas jo din main kai baar janaa padataa he' kaa prayog, ye do bindu dhyaan dene yogya hai, yah baat anuvadak yaa anuwaad prashikshanarthi ko spashtataa ke liye samajhaaii jaati he 
 Consequently, translation requires clarity and naturalness of inferiority
 saath hi, mulpath main mukhya upvakya par arth kii drushti se jo bal abhisht he, vah bhi surakshit rahata he 
 Both of these sentences have been translated and analyzed, mainly to explain the technique of analysis and its usefulness
 in donon main bhashabhed tathaa bhashaa sanrachana kii apni visheshtaayen hai, jinhen anuwaad-prashikshanarthion ko saiddhanthik tathaa pranalivaigyanik bhoomika par samajhaayaa jaataa he or anuwaad prakriya tathaa anudit paath kii upyuktata kii jaankaree ke prati usamen aatmavishvaas kii bhaavana kaa vikaas ho saktaa he, jo safal anuvadak banane ke liye apekshit mana jaataa he
 According to Newmark, the format of the translation process can be presented through the following diagram: naida or newmark dwaara prastaavit prakriya kaa vihangavlokan karne se pataa chalaa he ki donon kii anuwaad-prakriya sambandhi dharna main koi moulik antar nahin
 Being a Bible translator, Naida's vision was more confined to the problems of translating the ancient text; Hence they visualize the steps of analysis, transition and reorganization
 pracheen rachana hone ke kaaran bible kii bhashaa main arthgrahan kii samasya bhashaa kii vyakaranik sanrachana se adhik judi hui he 
 In this, grammar gets a place of special importance in the translation theory of Nida
 vyakaranik gathan se sambandhit arthgrahan main 'vishleshan' vishesh sahaayak mana jaataa he, atah naida ne sopan kaa namakaran bhi 'vishleshan' kiya 
 Newmark's vision is considered to be guided by the problems of translation work of modern and diverse linguistics
 atah ve bodhan tathaa abhivyakti ke sopanon kii kalpana karte hai
 But they also connect the original language text to the target language text, so that the translation-related comparison of the two texts can be clarified in the context of comparison and contrast
 neumark bhi bodhan ke liye vishisht bhashaa siddhanth prastut karte hai, jisamen ve shabdaarthvigyaan ko kendriya mahatva kaa sthaan dete hai
 In his various writings, he has given details of his theoretical establishment
 ek udhaaharan ke dwaara unke praaroop ko spasht kiya jaataa he : 1

 shabd-prati-shabd anuwaad se jahaan donon bhashaaon ke shabdakram kaa antar spasht hota he, vahaan shabdaarth str par donon bhashaaon kaa sambandh bhi prakat ho jaataa he 
 Translators become aware that 'safe' or 'reserved' is the correct word in Hindi for reserved, but in such co-use of Judgement or 'judgment' as it appears in the above sentence, word-by-word translation Would not be suitable isse yah saiddhanthik bhi spasht ho jaataa he ki, anuwaad ko do bhashaaon ke madhya kaa sambandh kehane kii apeksha do vishisht bhashaa bhedon yaa do vishisht paathon ke madhya kaa sambandh kahana adhik upyukt he, jisamen anuwaad kii ikai kaa aakaar, sambandhit bhashabhed yaa pathgat sandesh kii prakruti se nirdhaarit hota he 
 The entire sentence is the unit of translation in the presented sentence, because the appropriate translation of words in it is interdependent relationship based
 anuvadak yah bhi jaan jate hai ki, uparyukt vaakya kaa hindi samachar main jo 'nirnay surakshit rakh liya gaya he' yah anuwaad praayah dikhaai detaa he vah kyon aswabhaavik, anupyukt tathaa asampreshnty-vat prathit hota he 
 The translations that demonstrate the above-mentioned trend of verbatim translation are called ‘transcendentalism’
 vastutah anuwaad kii prakriya main aavriti kaa tatva hota he, arthath anuvadak do baar anuwaad karte hai 
 To understand the text, the original language is translated into: No admission → admission is not allowed; Similarly, we re-translate the message into the target language while restructuring or expressing the message in the target language, giving the shape of the target language text; 'no entry is allowed' → 'no entry allowed'
 is prakaar anybhashik anuwaad main donon bhashaaon ke str par sambhashik anuwaad kii sthiti aati he
 These are respectively called perceptual translations
 bodhanatmak anuwaad saadhan rup he - mulpath ke arth ko spasht karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 Reexamilative translation is the practicable form - the actual translated text
 yadi ek abhyast anuvadak ke yah ardh–aupchaarik yaa anaupchaarik rup main hota he, to anuwaad-prashikshanarthi ke liye iske aupchaarik prastutikaran kii aavashyaktaa or upyogita hoti he jisase vah anuwaad-prakriya ko gyaan ke str par bhi aatmsaat kar sake
 Bathgate refers to its format as the operational format, which is thought to match the practical nature of translation work more broadly than the formats of Nida and Newmark
 ise lekhak ne nimnlikhit chitra ke madhyam se prastut kiya he - Seven steps have been envisaged in this, of which, apart from the ladder of Parilochan, the rest is considered a holiday of overlap, but at the theoretical level, their relatively independent existence has been recognized
 mulbhasha paath kaa mul jaananaa or tadnusaar apni maansikta kaa mulpath se talmail baithaana samanvayan he 
 This step is a gradation of mental decorum based on a faint understanding of all aspects of the text, which explains the motivation to be used in translation work and provides an explanation of the role-building necessary for determining the translation strategy
 vishleshan or bodhan ke sopan purvawat hai 
 Bathlegs, under technical expressions, take portions that are of special importance in the conclusion of the text of the text as compared to other passages and which require special attention in determining translation translations
 punargathan bhi pehle ke hi samaan he 
 a complete investigation of the translated text comes under revision
 hastlekhan yaa tankan kii trutiyon ko dur karne ke atirikt abhivyakti main vyakarannishthata, parishkaran, shrutimdhurata, spashtataa, swaabhaaviktaa, upyuktata, suruchi, tathaa aadhunik prayog rudhi kii drushti se anudit paath kaa aavashyak sanshodhan punarikshan he 
 This work is often done by a person other than the translator, taking proper help from the translator
 yadi swayan anuvadak ko yah kaary karnaa ho to anuwaad kaary tathaa punarikshan kaary main samay kaa itnaa vyavdhaan avashya ho ki anuvadak anuwaad kaary kaaleen smriti ke pash se muktpraaya hokar anudit paath ke prati tatasth or aalochanatmak drushti apana sake tathaa is prakaar anuvadak se bhinn punareekshak ke daayitv kaa vahan kar sake 
 Paryalochan's stanza provides for confirmation of the authenticity of the translated text by dialogue between the subject expert and the translator
 jin paathon kii vishaywastu pramanikta kii apeksha rakhti he - jaise vidhi, prakrutivigyaan, samaaj vigyaan, praudyogiki, aadi - unamem paryalochan kii upyogita spasht hoti he
 Bathgate's format is explained by an example
 mulbhasha paath he kisi trek par likhaa hua soochna vaakyansh Public Carrier
 iske anuwaad kii maansik sajjataa karte samay anuvadak ko yah spasht hota he ki, is vaakyansh kaa uddeshy janata ko trek kii uplabdhta ke vishay main ek vishisht soochna dena he 
 While the message of this phrase has the power of effective or informative function, the informational function is also present in terms of its juridical and administrative side - both these terms impose certain restrictions on such trucks
 atah kul milakar yah vaakyansh sampreshan kendrit pranali ke dwaara anudit hone yogya he
 Translators determine the algebra or phrase by translating it into a perceptual translation at the step of analysis: It carries goods of the public = Carrier of public goods
 On the step of Bodhan, the translator makes it clear that, It can be hired = "it can be hired
" " paribhaashik abhivyakti ke sopan par anuvadak ise vidhi-prashasnic abhivyakti ke rup main pahachaanate hai, jiske sandesh ke anuwaad ko sampreshnty banaate hue anuvadak ko uski vishuddhta ko bhi yathochit rup se surakshit rakhana he 
 On the step of reorganization, there are two translations of this phrase before the translator: 'lokavahana' and 'bhade's truck'
 pichley sopanon kii bhoomika par anuvadak ke saamne yah spasht ho jaataa he ki - ‘lokvahan' main sandesh kaa vaidhanik paksh bhale surakshit ho parantu yah sampreshan ke uddeshy kii purti nahin kar paata 
 This expression does not immediately reveal to the ordinary educated what the use of Lokavahana is for him
 isko sampreshnty banane ke liye iskaa punarabhivyaktimulak anuwaad apekshit he - 'bhaade kaa trek' – jisase janata ko yah spasht ho jaataa he ki, is trek kaa uske liye kya upyog he 
 The original expression is so short and its accepted translation 'hire truck' is so clear that, in relation to it, it is said that there is no expectation of revision and analysis
 anuwaad prakriya ke vibhinn praroopon ke vivechan se nishkarshaswaroop do baaten spashtatah maani jaati hai 
 First, the translation process is a gradual process, in which three conditions are formed - anuwadpurv sthiti - anuwaad kaary ke sandarbh ko samajhnaa 
 Which text, for what purpose, for which category of readers, in which medium, to translate, etc
 is under it
 anuwaad kaary kii sthiti - mulbhasha paath kaa bodhan, sankraman, lakshya bhashaa main abhivyakti 
 Post-translational position - revising and editing of the translated text and thus the conclusion of the 'safe' text
 duusari baat yah he ki anuwaad, mulpath ke bodhan tathaa lakshyabhasha main abhivyakti, in do dhruvon ke madhya nirantar hote rahane vaali prakriya he, jo sidhi or pratyaksh na hokar ghumaavdaar tathaa paroksh he 
 The intermediate condition through which this process takes place is a conceptual cognitive structure, which is derived from textual comprehension and which also contains the seeds of transcendental expression
 yah bhashaa vishesh saapeksh shabdon ke bandhan se mukt shuddh arthmayi satta he 
 The translocation of this intermediate structure is the translator's brain
 saanskrithik-sanrachanaatmak drushti se apekshaakrit nikat bhashaaon main is vaicharik sanrachana kii satta kii chetana apekshaakrit spasht hoti he 
 Being situated at the ideological level, it does not have physical power - at the level of linguistic expression it does not take the form of a reality as it is; If translators express it on a linguistic level as well, then only in terms of theoretical necessity, wherein the rewriting of certain sentences and phrases is included as an analysis
 parantu yah bhi satya he ki yahi vah sanrachana he, jo anudit hokar lakshyabhasha paath main parinat hoti he 
 It is also said in other words that, the translator translates the conceptual structure of the text, but the intrinsic feature of the process of translation is that the structure that is ultimately translated into the target language is the intermediate conceptual structure that the textual conceptual The translator of the composition is drawn from realization! anuwaad prakriya ke is nirupan se saiddhanthik str par do baton kaa spashtikaran hota he 
 One, the conceptual structure derived from the translational perception of the text as the text takes the form of the target text, therefore translating the distinction from the translator
 duusare, uparyukt vaicharik sanrachana vishisht bhashaa nirpeksh hoti he - usamen donon bhashaaon ke madhyam se yathasambhav samaan tathaa nikatatam rup main abhivyakt hone kii sambhavyata hoti he 
 This is the interpretation of the message of the original text which is translated
 anuwaad prakriya ke uparyukt vivaran ke aadhaar par anuwaad prakriya kii prakruti ke paraspar sambaddh teen multatva nirdhaarit kiye jate hai : samamoolyata, dwandvatmakataa, or anuwaad parivritti
 In translational work, the similarity that the translator speaks of the target texts of the text is in terms of value
 yah mulya kaa tatva bhashaa ke shabdaarth tathaa vyakaran ke tathyon tak simit nahin hota, apitu praayah unase kuch adhik tathaa bhashaprayog ke sandarbh se se udbhoot hota he 
 In fact, it is a textual scientific concept and is associated with the level of message
 bhashaa ke bhashavaigyanik vishleshan main arth ke str par paryaayatta yaa anyayantar sambandh par aadhaarit hote hue bhi samamoolyata sandesh kaa gun he, jisamen paath kaa uski samagrata main grahan hota he 
 It is of course that the three components of textualism contribute to the determination of equivalence - the semantic equivalence is dominant over the syntactic equivalence and the contextual equivalence is recognized over the semantic equivalence
 duusare shabdon main, yadi donon bhashaaon main vakyarachana ke str par samamoolyata sthapit na ho to arthstareey samamoolyata nirdhaarit kerani hogi, or yadi arthstareey samamoolyata nirdhaarit na ho sake, to sandarbhastareey samamoolyata ko manyata deni hogi 
 For example, in the Hindi translation of "the meeting was chaired by X", "X presided over the meeting", parity is determined at the semantic level above the sentence level, because the two syntaxes have inequality in speech
 isi prakaar, What time is it? ke hindi anuwaad 'kitne baje hai ?' ke bich samamoolyata kaa nirdhaaran arthstar se upar sandarbh - samay poochna, jo ek dainik saamaajik vyavhaar kaa sandarbh he - ke str par hua he 
 Thus the condition of equivalence lies in the communicative side of the textual side as well as in the communicative side, in which the communicative side is positioned above the communicative side
 samamoolyata ko pathasanketavaigyanik sankalpana maanane se vyavhaar main jo chhot milti he, vah sampreshan kii manyata par aadhaarit anuwaad kaary kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne main samarth he 
 The language equivalents are related to which language is related, who is the intended reader of the language, what is the purpose of the translation - on the basis of these facts the translation equivalents are determined
 is prakriya main ve yadi kabhi shabdarthgat paryaayon tathaa gathnaatmak sanrachanaon kii samvadita se kabhi-kabhi bhinn ho sakate hai, to kuch prasangon main unase abhinn, at ev tadrup hone kii sambhaavna ko nakaara bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa 
 It is okay that languages are partly uneven in terms of structure, stylistic patterns etc
 and it is also right that they are also partly similar; The main thing is to identify those similar and dissimilar points
 sampreshan ke sandarbh main samanta ek lacheelee sthiti ban jaati he 
 Value equality has to be provided in translation
 anuwaadgat samamoolyata lakshya bhashapath kii drushti se yathasambhav swaabhaavik tathaa mulbhashapath ke yathasambhav nikatatam hoti he 
 It has a notable quality
 gatyaatmakataa, jiskaa taatpary yah he ki anuwaad ke pathak kii anuwaad samamoolyon ke prati vahi sweekaaryata he jo mul ke pathakon kii mul kii sambaddh abhivyaktiyon ke prati he 
 This similarity of acceptance or reaction is dynamic from being ambivalent, and that translation is the dynamics of parity
 anuwaad kaa sambandh do sthitiyon ke saath he 
 Translators call it dialectics
 yah dwandvatmakataa keval bhashaa ke aayam tak simit nahin, apitu samast anuwaad paristhiti main vyaapt he 
 Its basic feature is equilibrium, concordance or compromise
 ek prakriya, sambandh, or nishpatti ke rup main anuwaad kii dwandvatmakataa ke vibhinn ayaamon ko is prakaar nirupit kiya jaataa he : 1
 In translation, contact is established between the original author and another reader
 mul lekhak or duusare pathak ke bich desh yaa kaal yaa donon kii drushti se duuri yaa nikatataa se dwandvatmakataa ke swaroop main antar aata he 
 In terms of location, both the original author and the reader may be foreign, indigenous, or one of them may be foreign and one indigenous
 kaal kii drushti se donon ateetkaaleen ho sakate hai, donon samakaleen ho sakate hai, yaa lekhak ateet kaa or pathak samasamyik ho saktaa he 
 All these situations affect the translation process
 2
 anuwaad main, mul lekhak or anuvadak main santulan apekshit hota he 
 The translator has to reconcile his thinking method and expression method with the thinking method and expression method of the original author
 3
 anuwaad main, anuvadak tathaa anuwaad ke pathak ke madhya anubandh hota he 
 The purpose of translating the translator should be the same as the reader of the translation is concerned with reading the translation
 anuvadak ke liye aavashyak he ki, vah apane bhashaa prayog ko anuwaad ke sambhavit pathak kii bodhankshmata ke anusaar dhaale 
 4
 In translation, the personal interest of the translator and his professional requirement is required to be coordinated
 5
 apni prakruti kii drushti se purna anuwaad asambhav he tathaa anudit rachana mul rachana ke purnataya samaan nahin ho sakati, parantu saamaajik-saanskrithik tathaa raajnneetik-aarthik drushti se anuwaad kaary na keval mahatvapurn he apitu aavashyak or susangat bhi 
 In a successful translation, there is a balance of both the above situations
 6
 anuwaad main, do bhashaaon ke madhya sambandh ke pariprekshya main, ek or bhashaa-sanrachana tathaa bhashaa-prayog ke madhya dvandatmak sambandh spasht hota he, to duusari ore bhashaa-prayog ke saamaanya paksh or vishisht paksh ke madhya santulan kii sthiti ubharkar saamne aati he 
 7
 In translation, an adjustment between two specific texts of different uses of two languages is required at different levels and dimensions
 ye str / aayam hai - vyakaranik gathan, shabdkosh ke str, shabdakram kii vyavastha, sahprayog, shabdaarth, vyavastha, bhashastyli kii roodhiyaan, bhashaa-prakaarya, paath prakaar, saahitiyik saamaajik-saanskrithik roodhiyaan 
 8
 From a qualitative point of view, various types of balance are seen in translation
 kisi bhi paath kaa sab staron / ayaamon par purna anuwaad asambhav he, parantu sab prakaar ke paathon kaa anuwaad sambhav he 
 In a successful translation, the components of the following pairs appear in a state of equilibrium - purity and communicability, modality and functionality, literalism and independence, fundamentalism and beauty, and generosity and concordance
 tadnusaar ek safal anuwaad jitna sambhav ho, utana vishuddh, rupanishth, shabdic, or mulanishth hota he tathaa jitna aavashyak ho utana sampreshnty prakaaryaatmak, swatantra, or sundar hota he 
 Similarly, a successful translation has a tendency to euphoria, but it is desirable to be brief in terms of skill of target language usage
 9
 karypranali kii drushti se, kshatipurti ke niyam ke anusaar anuwaad main mukhyatya nimnlikhit yugmon ke ghatakon main sah-astitv dikhaai detaa he : chhotna-judana or alankarikta-subodhta 
 For the restructuring of the message expressed in the target language, it is necessary to omit some of the original text and to add something to the target language text
 yadi kuch chhutegaa to kuch judega bhi; vishesh baat yah he ki na chhootane laayak yathasambhav chute nahin tathaa na judane laayak jude nahin 
 Some rhetorical expressions of the text, such as metaphors, use figurative expressions in translation when the target language cannot be resolved - the effectiveness of the ornament takes the place of comprehension of the general statement
 yahi baat vipareet dhang se bhi ho sakati he - mul kii subodh abhivyakti ke liye lakshyabhasha main ek alankrita abhivyakti kaa chayan kar liya jaataa he, parantu vah lakshyabhasha kii bahuprachlit rudhi ho jo prabhavotpadak hone ke saath-saath subodh bhi ho ye atyaavashyak hota he
 a discussion of the various dimensions of dialectics sheds a broad light on the nature of translational communication
 yah santulan jitna sweekaarya hota he, anuwaad utana hi safal prathit hota he
 Translation practice is an inevitable and desirable and natural condition in translation work
 parivritti se abhipraay he donon bhashaaon ke madhya vibhinn stareey samvadita se vichlan 
 There can be two conditions of deviation - compulsory and voluntary
 anivaary vichlan bhashaa kii shabdarthgat evam vyakaranik sanrachana kaa antarang he; udhaaharan ke liye marathi napunskaling sangya hindi main pulling yaa streeling sangya ke rup main hi anudit hogi 
 a similar thing can be said for the Hindi translation of 'I have fever' in the English sentence i have fever, because 'I keep fever' is not accepted as a communicative fact in Hindi
 aichhik vichlan main vikalp kii vyavastha hoti he 
 The English "the rule states that" can be said in Hindi in two forms - "this rule has the arrangement that / is stated" or "this rule says that"
 in donon main pehla vaakya hindi main swaabhaavik prathit hota he, utana doosraa nahin yadhyapi ab yah bhi adhik prachlit mana jaataa he 
 a suitable translation will have priority over the first translation
 anuwaad ke sandarbh main aichhik vichlan kii vishesh praasangikta is drushti se he ki, isse anuwaad ko swaabhaavik banane main sahaayta milti he 
 Essential deviation is a common fact of comparative-contrast language analysis, in which translation is used as a tool
 anuwaad-parivritti kii sankalpana kaa sambandh pradhan rup se vyakaran ke saath mana gaya he
 It appears in two forms - perimeter of grammatical words and permeation of grammatical categories
 vyakaranik shabdon kii parivritti kaa ek udhaaharan uparyukt vaakyayugma main dikhaai detaa he 
 The determinative or definitive article in English the Hindi adjective adjective has become 'this / this', although it is under compulsory deviation
 vyakaranik kotiyon kii parivritti main anuvadak do bhedon kii ore vishesh dhyaan dete hai - vyakaranik kotiyon kii parivritti tathaa shrenee-parivritti 
 The example of transposition in the grammatical structure of grammatical categories in a sentence is the changing of the order of the functional categories, doer + verb + karma, into Hindi to doer + karma + verb in transitive sentences in English
 yah parivritti ke anivaary vichlan ke antargat he; atah vyatirek he 
 a well-known example of class change is the passage of the phrase in the target language or the phrase of the phrase
 angreji-hindi anuwaad main is prakaar kii parivritti ke udhaaharan praayah mil jate hai -bhartiya relon main suraksha sambandhi nirdeshawali ke angreji paath kaa sheershak he : "travel safely" or hindi paath kaa sheershak he : ‘suraksha ke upaay', jabaki angreji main bhi ek padabandh ho saktaa he - "measures of safety
" isi prakaar padastareey, visheshtah samast pad ke str kii, ikai kaa ek padabandh ke rup main anudit hone ke udhaaharan bhi praayah mil jate hai - angrezi "she is a good natured girl" = "vah achche swabhaav kii ladki he" 
 Both examples of category transitions are under voluntary deviation
 angrezi se hindi ke anuwaad ke sandarbh main, visheshtya prashasnic paathon ke anuwaad ke sandarbh main, pai jane vaali pramukh anuwaad parivritiyaan nimnlikhit hai : an0 nirjeev karta yukt sakarmak sanrachana = hi0 akarmakeekrut sanrachana : The rule states that = This rule provides that
 an0 karmavachi / kartruvachya = hi0 kartruvachya / karmavachi : The meeting was chaired by x = x presided over the meeting
 i cannot drink milk now = mujhase ab doodh nahin piya jayega 
 Numeral prepositional / present-day participle clause = h to issue instructions = ve anudesh jari karen 
 End clause = Pass phrase: till a decision is taken on the main file = mukhya misil par nirnay hone tak
