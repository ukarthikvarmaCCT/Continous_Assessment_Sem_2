 Seeing this, they were very surprised and started thinking that what God will not protect the offerings offered to him will protect humanity? He argued with his father and argued that we should not worship such a helpless God
 apni choti bahan or chachaa kii haije ke kaaran hui mrityu se ve jivan-maran ke arth par gaharaai se sochane lage or aise prashn karne lage jisase unke mata pita chintit rahane lage
 Then his parents decided to marry him at the beginning of adolescence (this was common practice)
 lekin balak mulshankar ne nishchay kiya ki vivaah unke liye nahin bana he or ve 1846 main satya kii khoj main nikal pade
 Maharishi Dayanand has a high sense of idealism in his heart, a natural tendency to take a realistic path, an indomitable zeal to redesign the destiny of the motherland, a keen desire to contemplate religious-socio-economic and political terms and a glorious past among the Aryavarites
 There was a feeling of loyalty
 unhone kisi ke virodh tathaa ninda karne kii parvaah kiye bina aryaavart ke hindu samaaj kaa kayakalp karnaa apana dhyey bana liya tha
 On the day of Shivaratri in Phalgun Krishna Samvat 1895, his life took a new turn
 unhen nayaa bodh hua
 He left the house and while traveling he reached Guru Virjanand
 guruvar ne unhen panini vyakaran, paatanjal-yogasutra tathaa veda-vedang kaa adhyayan karaayaa
 In Guru Dakshina, he sought - show success by learning, doing charity, salvation of the true scriptures, do not eradicate the ignorance of dissenters, remove the darkness of ignorance from the light of Vedas, radiate the light of Vedic religion everywhere
 yahi tumhaari gurudakshina he
 He blessed that God would make his efforts successful
 unhone antim shiksha di -manushyakrut granthon main ishwar or rishiyon kii ninda he, rishikrut granthon main nahin
 Vedas are proof
 is kasuti ko haath se na chhodana
 Maharishi Dayanand traveled to many places
 unhone haridwar main kumbh ke avasar par 'pakhand khandini pataakaa' fahraai
 He did many lectures
 ve kalakatta main babu keshavachandra sen tathaa devendra nath thakur ke sampark main aae
 It is from here that he started wearing full clothes and speaking and writing in Hindi
 yaheen unhone tatkaaleen visarai ko kaha tha, main chahta hum videshiyon kaa rajya bhi purna sukhadaayak nahin he
 But it is very difficult to get rid of different language, different education, different behavior
 bina iske chute paraspar kaa vyavhaar puraa upkaar or abhipraay siddh hona kathin he
 Maharishi Dayanand established the Aryasamaj at Chaitra Shukla Pratipada Samvat in 1932 in Girgaum Mumbai
 aryasamaj ke niyam or siddhant pranimaatr ke kalyaan ke liye he
 To benefit the world is the main objective of this society, that is, physical, spiritual and social progress
 main maanata hoon ki gita main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Also the Gita is not against the Vedas
 vedon ko chhod kar koi anya dharmagranth pramaan nahin he - is satya kaa prachaar karne ke liye swami ji ne saare desh kaa daura karnaa prarambh kiya or jahaan-jahaan ve gayi pracheen parampara ke pandit or vidwaan unase haar maanate gayi
 He had extensive knowledge of Sanskrit language
 sanskrit main ve dharapravaah bolte the
 At the same time, they were very logical
 unhone isai or muslim dharmagranthon kaa bhalee-bhaanti adhyayan-manthan kiya tha
 So alone they started a struggle on three fronts
 do morche to isiyat or islam ke the kintu teesraa morcha sanatandharmee hinduon kaa tha, jinase jujhane main swami ji ko anek apmaan, kalank or ksht jhelane pade
 There was no response to the torch lit by Dayanand
 ve jo kuch kah rahe the, uskaa uttar na to musalmaan de sakate the, na isai, na puraanon par palane vaale hindu pandit or vidwaan
 Hindu Navothan had now come into full light and many sensible people started to feel in their mind that in fact there is no essence in the Pongapanthi of mythological religion
 swamiji prachlit dharmon main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa kadaa khandan karte the chaahe vah sanathan dharm ho yaa islam ho yaa isai dharm ho
 In his Mahagranth Satyarth Prakash, Swamiji has denied the evils prevailing in all opinions
 unke samakaleen sudhaarkon se alag, swamiji kaa mat shikshit varg tak hi simit nahin tha apitu arya samaaj ne aryaavart ke saadhaaran janamanas ko bhi apni ore aakarshith kiya
 In 1872, Swamiji came to Calcutta
 vahaan devendranath thakur or keshavachandra sen ne unka bada satkar kiya
 He also had discussions with Brahmo Samajis, but Brahmo Samaj scholars influenced by Christianity could not agree with Swami regarding the rebirth and authenticity of Veda
 kehete hai kalkatte main hi keshavachandra sen ne swami ji ko yah salaah de daali ki yadi aap sanskrit chhod kar aryabhasha main bolnaa armbh karen, to desh kaa aseem upkaar ho saktaa he
 Since then, the language of Swami Ji's lectures became Aryabhasha and he started to have a lot of followers in the Aryan speaking provinces
 kalkatte se swami ji mumbai padhaare or vahiin 10 april 1875 i
 ko unhone 'arya samaaj' kii sthapana kii
 Prayer community also discussed with him in Mumbai
 kintu yah samaaj to brahmo samaaj kaa hi mumbai sanskaran tha
 Therefore, even the people of this society could not agree with Swami ji
 mumbai se laut kar swami ji indraprastha aae
 There he called a meeting of Christian, Muslim and Hindu priests for Satyansandha
 kintu do dinon ke vichaar-vimarsh ke baad bhi log kisi nishkarsh par nahin pahunch sake
 Swamiji went to Punjab from Indraprastha
 punjab main unke prati bahut utsaah jaagrath hua or saare praant main aryasamaj kii shakhaaen khulne lageen
 Since then, Punjab has been the principal stronghold of the Arya Samajis
 maharishi dayanand ne tatkaaleen samaaj main vyaapt saamaajik kuritiyon tathaa andhvishwaason or rudhiyon-buraaiyon ko dur karne ke liye, nirbhay hokar un par akraman kiya
 They were called 'saints warriors'
 unhone janmana jati kaa virodh kiya tathaa karm ke aadhaar vedanukool varna-nirdhaaran kii baat kahi
 He was a supporter of Dalits
 unhone striyon kii shiksha ke liye prabal aandolan chalaaya
 He prohibited child marriage and sati and supported widow marriage
 unhone ishwar ko sristi kaa nimitt kaaran tathaa prakruti ko anadi tathaa shaashvat mana
 He was an advocate of oilism
 unke darshanik vichaar vedanukool the
 He also believed that the living beings are free to work and are free to enjoy the fruits
 maharishi dayanand sabhi dharmanuayiyon ko ek manch par laakar ekta sthapit karne ke liye prayatnsheel the
 He made such an effort in 1878 during the Indraprastha court
 unke amar granth satyarth prakaash, sanskaar vidhi or rigvedadi bhashya bhoomika main unke moulik vichaar suspasht rup main prapya hai
 He was a yogi and had special emphasis on pranayama
 ve saamaajik punargathan main sabhi varnon tathaa striyon kii bhagidaari ke pakshdhar the
 In the direction of national awakening, he adopted the path of social revolution and spiritual revival
 unki shiksha sambandhi dharanaon main pradarshit doordarshita, deshbhakti tathaa vyavhaarikta purnataya praasangik tathaa uganukool he
 Maharishi Dayanand was not only a social reformer and a pioneer of religious renaissance, he was also a great nationalist and political idealist
 videshiyon ke aryaavart main rajya hone ke kaaran aapas kii foot, matbhed, brahmacharya kaa seven na karnaa, vidhaan padhnaa-padhaana va baalyavastha main aswayamvaravivaah, vishayasakti, mithyaa bhashaavadi, kulakshan, veda-vidya kaa prachaar aadi kukarm hai, jab aapas main bhai-bhai ladte hai or tabhi teesraa videshi aakar panch ban baithta he
 He has also enumerated the qualifications required for the head of state and various councils and committees of government
 unhone nyaay kii vyavastha rishi pranit granthon ke aadhaar par kiye jane kaa paksh liya
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati is generally known only as the founder and social reformer of the Arya Samaj
 rashtriya swatantrata ke liye kiye gaye prayatnon main unki ullekhneey bhoomika kii jaankaree bahut kam logon ko he
 The fact is that Swami Dayanand Saraswati had probably first dared to say that "aryavarta belongs to Aryavartis" in the subordinated Aryavarta
 hamaare pratham swatantrata samar, san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn yojana bhi swami ji ke netritv main hi taiyaar kii gai thi or vahi uske pramukh sutaradhar bhi the
 He often preached nationalism to the audience in his sermons and filled the spirit of dying for the country
 1855 main haridwar main jab kumbh mela laga tha to usamen shaamil hone ke liye swami ji ne abu parvat se haridwar tak paidal yatra kii thi
 On the way, he preached from place to place and explored the pulse of the countrymen
 unhone yah anubhav kiya ki log ab angrejon ke atyaachaari shashan se tang aa chuke hai or desh kii swatantrata ke liye sangharsh karne ko aatur ho uthe hai
 Swami Dayanand Saraswati reached Haridwar and camped in a solitary place on a hill there
 vahiin par unhone paanch aise vyaktiyon se mulaakaat kii, jo aage chalakar san 1857 kii kranti ke karnadhaar bane
 These five persons were Nana Saheb, Azimullah Khan, Bala Saheb, Tatya Tope and Babu Kunwar Singh
 baatcheet kaaphi lambi chali or yaheen par yah tay kiya gaya ki firangi sarkaar ke viruddh sampoorn desh main sashastr kranti ke liye aadharbhumi taiyaar kii jaae or uske baad ek nishchit din sampoorn desh main ek saath kranti kaa bigul baja diya jaae
 a plan of 'roti Aur Kamal' was also prepared to spread the voice of this revolution among the general public and Aryavartiya soldiers
 is sampoorn vichaar vimarsh main pramukh bhoomika swami dayanand saraswati kii hi thi
 After discussion and planning, Swamiji stopped in Haridwar and the other five national leaders went to their respective places to give realization to the plan
 unke jane ke baad swami ji ne apane kuch vishwast sadhu sanyasiyon se sampark sthapit kiya or unka ek gupt sanghathan banaaya
 The headquarters of this organization was built at the Yogmaya temple at Mehrauli in Indraprastha
 is mukhyalay ne swadhinata samar main ullekhneey bhoomika nibhaai
 Under the leadership of Swamiji, sadhus also awakened the revolution throughout the country
 ve krantikariyon ke sandesh ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaate, unhen protsaahit karte or aavashyaktaa padane par swayan bhi hathiyaar uthaakar angrejon se sangharsh karte
 During the entire period of the revolution of 1857, the national leader, Swami Dayanand Saraswati remained in constant contact
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa par bhi swami ji niraash nahin the
 He was already aware of the fact that freedom cannot be attained only by trying once
 iske liye to sangharsh kii lambi prakriya chalaani hogi
 At the 1855 meeting in Haridwar itself, when Babu Kunwar Singh asked Swamiji about the possibility of success in this struggle, his answer was "the freedom struggle never fails
" bharat dhire-dhire ek sau varsh main paratantra bana he
 Now it will take one hundred years to become independent as well
 is swatantrata prapti main bahut se anmol praanon kii aahutiyaan daali jaaengi
 "how accurate Swami Ji's prediction turned out to be, was confirmed by subsequent events
 swatantrata-sangharsh kii asafalataa ke baad jab tathya tope, naanaa sahab tathaa anya rashtriya netaa swami ji se mili to unhen bhi unhone niraash na hone tathaa uchit samay kii pratiksha karne kii hi salaah di
 Two years after the revolution of 1857, Swamiji made Swami Virjanand his guru and took initiation from him
 swami virajanand ke ashram main rahakar unhone vedon kaa adhyayan kiya, un par chintan kiya or uske baad apane guru ke nirdeshaanusaar ve vaidic gyaan ke prachaar-prasar main jute gaye
 To achieve this objective, he also founded the Arya Samaj and through it did many works of social improvement
 chuaachhut, sati pratha, bal vivaah, nar bali, dharmik sankeernata tathaa andhvishwaason ke viruddh unhone jamkar prachaar kiya or vidhwaa vivaah, dharmik udaartaa tathaa aapasi bhaichaare kaa unhone samarthan kiya
 Along with all this, Swamiji never failed to fill the spirit of patriotism among the people
 prarambh main anek vyaktiyon ne swami ji ke samaaj sudhaar ke kaaryon main vibhinn prakaar ke vighn daale or unka virodh kiya
 Gradually, his arguments started coming to the understanding of the people and the opposition decreased
 unki lokapriyata nirantar badhane lagi
 This led to a desire in the minds of British officials that if they were made in favor of the British Government, then through them, the British could be popularized in the general public
 isse purv angrej adhikari isi prakaar se anya kuch dharmopadeshkon tathaa dharmadhikariyon ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan dekar apni taraf mila chuke the
 He also considered Swami Dayanand Saraswati like him
 tadnusaar ek isai padri ke madhyam se swami ji kii tatkaaleen governor general lord northbrook se mulaakaat karavaayi gai
 The meeting took place in Calcutta in March 1873
 idhar-udhar kii kuch aupchaarik baton ke uparant lord northbrook ne vinamrata se apni baat swami ji ke saamne rakhi- "apane vyaakhyaan ke prarambh main aap jo ishwar kii prarthana karte hai, kya usamen aap angreji sarkaar ke kalyaan kii bhi prarthana kar sakenge
 " garvanar general kii baat sunakar swami ji sahaj hi sab kuch samaj gaye
 He also felt pity for the intelligence of the British government, which could not understand him properly
 unhone nirbhikta or dridhtaa se governor general ko uttar diya- The Governor General did not expect such a sharp reply from Swamiji
 mulaakaat tatkaal samaapt kar di gai or swami ji vahaan se laut aae
 After this, the intelligence department of the government had a keen eye on Swami ji and his organization Arya Samaj
 unki prayek gatividhi or unke dwaara bole gaye prayek shabd kaa ricard rakhaa jane laga
 Due to their impact on the general public, the government began to realize that this rebel Fakir and Arya Samaj can become a threat to the government any day
 isliye swami ji ko samaapt karne ke liye bhi tarah-tarah ke shadyantr rache jane lage
 The circumstances under which Swamiji died, give the same impression that there was definitely a conspiracy of the English government in it
 swami ji kii mrityu 30 oktober 1883 ko deepawali ke din sandhyaa ke samay hui thi
 In those days, he had gone to Jodhpur at the invitation of King Naresh Jaswant Singh
 vahaan unke nity hi pravachan hote the
 Sometimes Maharaja Jaswant Singh would also sit at his feet and listen to his sermons there
 do-chaar baar swami ji bhi rajya mehalon main gaye
 There he saw the unnecessary intervention of a prostitute named Nanhi and his immense influence on Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 swami ji ko yah bahut bura laga
 When he explained this to Maharaj, he politely accepted his word and broke the relationship with the little one
 isse nanheen swami ji ke bahut adhik viruddh ho gai
 He got Swami ji's cook Kalia alias Jagannath on his side and got the glass mixed in his milk
 thodi hi der baad swami ji ke paas aakar apana aparaadh sweekaar kar liya or uske liye kshamaa maangi
 The benevolent-hearted Swami Ji gave him five hundred rupees for his living and living, so that the police would not disturb him
 baad main jab swami ji ko jodhpur ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya to vahaan sambandhit chikitsak bhi shaq ke daayre main rahaa
 He was accused of giving light poison to Swamiji in the name of medicine
 baad main jab swami ji kii tabiyat bahut kharaab hone lagi to unhen ajmer ke aspataal main laayaa gaya
 But by then there was a lot of delay
 swami ji ko bachaaya nahin ja sakaa
 The apprehension in this entire incident is that the task of raising the prostitute and tricking the doctor was done by a British officer at the behest of the British government
 anyathaa ek saadhaaran veshya ke liye yah sambhav nahin tha ki keval apane balboote par swami dayanand saraswati jaise suprasiddh or lokapriy vyakti ke viruddh aisa shadyantr kar sake
 Without such encouragement and protection, even the doctor could not do this audacity
 swadharm, swabhaasha, swarashtra, swasamskruti or swadeshonnati ke agradoot swami dayanand ji kaa sharir san 1883 main deepawali ke din panchtatv main villin ho gaya or ve apane peeche chhod gaye ek siddhanth, krinvanto vishwamaryam - arthath saare sansar ko shreshth maanav banaao
 His last words were - "lord! You did well
 aapaki ichha purna ho
 " swami dayanand saraswati ne kai dharmik va saamaajik pustaken apni jivan kaal main likhin
 The early books were in Sanskrit, but over time he also wrote many books in Aryabhasa, because Aryabhasa had more reach than Sanskrit
 hindi ko unhone 'aryabhasha' kaa naam diya tha
 Swami Dayanand was the pioneer and early man who used the Aryabhasha for better writing
 swami dayanand saraswati kii mukhya kritiyaan nimnlikhit hai- In 1873, a book called Aryodeshyaratnamala was published in which Swamiji described the definition of one hundred words
 inamen se kai shabd aam bolchaal main aate hai par unke arth rutes ho gaye hai, udhaaharan ke liye, ishwar, dharm, karm, aadi
 They are defined and explained in this book
 is laghu pustika main 8 prishth hai
 In 1881, Swami Dayanand published a book called Gokrunanidhi which also takes credit for playing a major role in establishing the Goraksha movement
 is pustak main unhone sabhi samudaay ke logon ko apane pratinidhi sahit gokrishyaadi raksha samiti kii sadsyta lene ko kaha he jiskaa uddeshy pashu va krishi kii raksha he
 Like modern environmentalists, ideas have been made here
 is pustak main samiksha, niyam va upanium hai, tathaa pramukhtah pashuon ko na maar kar unka paalan karne main hone vaale laabh varnit kiye gaye hai
 The book Behavnabhanu was published in 1880 by the Vedic machinery, Banaras
 isamen dharmokt or uchit vyavhaar ke bare main varnan he
 On 27 February 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati in Udaipur published an acknowledgment in which he handed over the responsibility of philanthropy to 23 persons after his death, who could then carry on their work
 inamen mahadev govind rande kaa bhi naam he
 This acknowledgment is signed as a witness to 13 dignitaries
 iske prakaashan ke kuch chah maah pashchaat hi unka dehant ho gaya tha

 laaegulas yaa sirf agulas, dakshin africa ke pashchimi kep praant kaa ek tateey gaanv he or africa ke mukhya bhoomi kii dakshintam basaavat he
 It is located northeast of Agulus, the southernmost tip of Africa
 vichaarwaad yaa adarshavaad yaa pratyaywad un vichaaron or manyataon kii samekit vichaardhaara he jinke anusaar is jagat kii samast vasteen vichaar yaa chetana kii abhivyakti he
 The essence of creation is not the root matter but the basic consciousness
 adarshavaad jadta yaa bhautikwaad kaa vipareet rup prastut karata he
 It forms the basis for the principle of the spiritual-non-material being primary and the physical being secondary, which makes it closer to the roots of religion in relation to the finiteness of the world and the creation of the world by God
 adarshavaad chetana ko prakruti se alag karke dekhtaa he, jiske falswaroop vah maanav chetana or sangyaan kii prakriya ko anivarytah rahasyamay banaata he or aksar sanshaywad tathaa agyeyavaad kii taraf badhane lagata he
 According to some thinkers, the major distinction between munusya and other beings is that man can use suffixes and other beings do not have this ability
 kutta do manushyon ko dekhtaa he, parantu 2 ko usne kabhi nahin dekha
 There are two types of suffixes - scientific and moral
 sankhya, gun, maatra aadi vaigyanik pratyayon kaa astitv to asandigdh he, parantu naitik pratyayon kaa astitv vivaad kaa vishay bana rahaa he
 We say- 'today the weather is very good'
 yahan ham achchhepan kaa varnan karte hai or iske saath achchhai ke adhik nune hone kii ore sanket karte hai
 a similar distinction is also made with respect to deeds
 naitik pratyay ko adarsh bhi kehete hai
 Ideal is a situation which- kuch log mulya ko maanav kalpana kaa pad hi dete hai
 The object that attracts us for some reason is valuable or gentle in our eyes
 iske vipareet afalaatoon ke vichaar main pratyay yaa adarsh hi vaastavik astitv rakhte hai, drusht vastuon kaa astitv to chaaya maatr he
 According to a third view, which Aristotle represents, the ideal is not the beginning of reality, but the 'end'
 'niti' ke aarambh main hi vah kahata he ki sari vastuen adarsh kii ore chal rahi hai
 Prices distinguish high and low
 jab ham kehete hai ki 'k', 'kha' se uttam he, tab hamaara aashay yahi hota he ki sarvottam se kha kii apeksha k kaa antar thodaa he
 The basis of price comparison is the best
 ise 'nickshreyas' kehete hai
 The main question in the policy was to understand the nature of Disarm or Best Price for ancient Greece and India
 nickshreyas yaa sarvocch adarsh ke swaroop ke sambandh main sabhi isse sahamat hai ki yah chetana se sambhddha he, parantu jyon hi ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki chetana main koun sa ansh sadhymoolya he, tyonhi matbhed prastut ho jaataa he
 Some people say that the consumption of happiness is such a value
 kuch gyaan, budhimatta, prem yaa shivasankalp ko yah pad dete hai
 Some take refuge in pluralism in this option, and say that more than one thing is mediocre
 To decide whether or not an object is mediocre, Dr
 Moore has suggested the following: Imagine the complete equality of the two alternatives
 Is, except that a particular object exists in a dislocation
 in donon viplvon main tumhaari buddhi kiske astitv ko adhik upyukt samajhati he? jo vastu aisi sthiti main ek viplav ko duusare se adhik upyukt banaati he, vah sadhymoolya hai
 The existence of values, the distinction between superiority and the existence of the best value is the fundamental notion of idealism
 isse sambhddha kuch anya dharanaayen bhi adarshavaadiyon ke liye maanya hai
 Of these, we will consider three here: in teenon dharanaon par tanik vichaar kii aavashyaktaa he
 The distinction between the common and the special is reflected in the controversy of selfishness and servitude
 bhogavaad ne swaarth se aarambh kiya, parantu sheeghra hi iske dhyey main swaarth ne sthaan praapt kar liya
 The ultimate aim of man is to consume more and more numbers
 duusari ore kaant ne bhi kaha ki nirpeksh aadesh kii drushti main saare manushya ek samaan saadhy hai, koi manushya bhi saadhan maatr nahin
 Like death, moral life eradicates all distinctions
 koi manushya kartavya se upar nahin, koi adhikaron se vanchit nahin
 Kant's statement on this subject is famous: In the world and beyond it, we cannot contemplate anything other than Shiva's resolution, which is unconditional or gentle without any condition
 jon stuart mil jaise sukhwadi ne bhi kaha, trupt boar se atrupt sucraat hona uttam he
 Mill did not see that in this acceptance, he moved away from his theory and supported idealism
 sucraat main aisa aadhyatmik ansh he jo boar main vidyaman nahin
 Thomas Hill Green has sought to explain in detail that modern moral sentiment has advanced much further than the spirit of ancient Greece in these two things — the distinction between man and man has diminished and the spiritual aspect of life is progressing
 kaant ke vichaar main maanav prakruti main pramukh ansh 'naitik bhaavana' kaa he, vah anubhav karata he ki karttavyapaalan kii maang shesh sabhi maangon se adhik adhikaar rakhti he, naitik aadesh 'nirpeksh aadesh' he
 With this acceptance, acceptance of moral independence also becomes mandatory
 'tumhen karnaa chahie, isliye tum kar sakate ho
 In the absence of merit, the question of responsibility cannot arise
 yahan ek kathin sthiti prastut ho jaati haih naitik adarsh shreshthatam kii siddhi he yaa uski ore chalate janaa he? jis avasthaa ko ham shreshthatam samajhate hai, use praapt karne par use shreshthatam hi pate hai
 Wherever we arrive, error and imperfection remain
 swayan kaant ne kaha he ki hamaara antim uddeshy purnataa he or isaki siddhi ke liye anant kaal kii aavashyaktaa he
 Some thinkers say that some degree of imperfection must remain
 sorto apni prasiddh pustak 'naitik mulya' main kahata haih 'kalpana karo ki saare mulyon kii siddhi ho gai he
 What will happen to the policy if this happens? There will be no ideal to move forward
 safalataa saare praytn kaa ant kar degi or is tarah siddhi praapt naitik adarsh jivan ko purna karne main samaapt kar degaa
 Because of this difficulty, Bradley stated that there is an internal conflict in moral life: the end of all moral effort is its own killing
 shiksha adikaal se hi vibhinn darshanik vichaardhaaraon se prabhavit hoti chali aa rahi he, kintu is par sabase adhik prabhaav adarshavaad kaa padaa he
 The names of Plato, Comenius, Pestologie and Froebel are particularly notable among those who gave prominence to idealism in the field of education
 adarshavaadiyon ke anusaar shiksha ek ‘chetana' athwa 'bauddhik prakriya’ he jo ki balak main sadgunon kaa vikaas kar use ek prakritik praani se aadhyatmik praani banaati hai
 Cultural traditions and knowledge are the means to accomplish this activity
 is kriya kaa ‘saadhy kaa lakshya’ chaatr ko aatmanubhuti karne kaa avasar pradaan karnaa tathaa unka charitra nirmaan karnaa hota he
 Thus, according to the idealistic ideology, education is the conscious and intellectual process in which the disciple is given self-realization by the Guru
 shiksha kii is avadharana se pataa chalata he ki shiksha koi ekangi prakriya nahin he apitu do dhuravon ke madhya chalane vaali prakriya he jisamen ek dhurav shikshaarthi he jisaki mul prakruti kaa parishkar kiya jaataa he tathaa doosraa dhurav shikshak hota he jo balak kii mul prakruti kaa ‘shodhan’ evam margtarikaran kar use shaashvat mulyon evam aadarshon se avgat karaata he taaki vah prakritik praani se aadhyatmik praani main parivartit ho sake
 According to the idealists, the ultimate aim of human life is to know the ultimate form of the soul-god, this is called self-realization, attainment of ideal personality, attainment of God and attainment of ultimate joy
 aatma-paramatma ke charam swaroop ko jaanane ke liye adarshavaadiyon ke anusaar manushya ko chaar sopan paar karne hote hai
 On the first step, he has to develop his 'natural self'
 duusare sopan par use apane ‘saamaajik swa’ kaa vikaas karnaa hota he
 On the third step, he has to develop his 'mental self' and on the last step he has to develop his 'spiritual self'
 adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke anusaar maanav praani ishwar kii sarvotkrisht rachana he jisko usne aseemit shaktiyaan pradaan kii hai
 The personality is formed by the sum of these different strengths and abilities
 isiilie adarshavaadi vichaarak vyaktitv ko ooncha uthaanaa athwa usamen nihit vibhinn sarvocch shaktiyon evam kshamtaaon kaa prakatikaran evam achche maarg kii ore le janaa hi shiksha kaa uddeshy maanate hai
 It is clear that the personality of a person is important and 'soul' has special importance than the physical body of a person
 isliye adarshavaad ke anusaar maanav-jivan kaa uddeshy isi ‘aatma’ kaa bodh karnaa he
 Self-revelation is also necessary for self-realization
 aatm prakaashan ke liye ‘saamaajik swa’ ko viksit karnaa aavashyak he
 The development of social self means - man follows the rules accepted by the society, his choice depends on social acceptance and rejection
 adarshavaadi yah maanate hai ki manushya kii sabase badi visheshta uski samskruti he, rahan-sahan, reeti rivaaj, bhashaa sahitya, kala sangeet evam mulya hai
 These only lead him from natural 'self' to social self, to establish a well-adjusted adjustment with society and environment, one must get the opportunity of 'self-revelation'
 aatm prakaashan ke liye ‘bauddhik swa’ kaa vikaas aavashyak he
 This is the situation when a man's behavior is not controlled by social acceptance and rejection, it is controlled by his intelligence and conscience
 plato kaa vichaar he ki manushya kii buddhi evam vivek uske samast aadarshon, krityon evam aadhyatmik cheshtaaon kaa aadhaar hote hai
 Without wisdom there cannot be knowledge, without knowledge there cannot be wisdom and without wisdom one cannot distinguish true-untruth, Shiva-ashiva and Sundar-asunder and Satya Shivam Sundaram cannot be attained
 aatmanubhuti se ham vaastavik satya kaa darshan karte hai
 Idealists believe that when a man rises above his 'natural self' and 'social self' and starts controlling himself in his 'intellectual self', then he gradually starts to enter the realm of 'spiritual self'
 plato kaa vichaar he ki manushya kii pravriti satyam, shivan tathaa sundaram kii taraf jhuki hoti he
 He is always in search of truth and accepts what is welfare and beautiful and renounces what is not welfare and beautiful
 adarshavaadi manushya ko is prakriya main prashikshit karne par bal dete hai
 To achieve the above goal, it is necessary to bring about a change in attitude
 is bhautik jagat ke nanaatv se mukti hi shiksha kaa lakshya hona chahie
 It is also said that arthath vidya vah he jo mukti pradaan kare
 It is clear from this that the ultimate development of such a personality is the aim of idealistic education in which a person can attain self-realization, truth, Shiva and beauty
 aatmanubhuti kaa bodh prakritik dein nahin he isliye vyakti ko satat abhyaas evam praytn dwaara ise praapt karne kii koshish kerani chaiye
 Idealists views have not only determined the objectives of education but have also determined the nature of the curriculum suitable for it
 kyonki shiksha ke uddeshyon kii prapti tabhi sambhav he jabaki paathyakram bhi usee ke anusaar ho
 Idealism is the elixir of a person's personality or the attainment of eternal ideals of self-realization and does not consider the cultural material world to be the ultimate truth, but he only accepts the realization of the truth, idealism in the same material world and with the help of the physical environment is the advice to achieve the extreme truth
 gives
 manushya kaa aadhyatmik vaataavaran adhik mahatvapurn hota he kintu prakritik vaataavaran kii upeksha nahin kii ja sakati
 Person is a combination of body and mind and mind is more important in this
 kintu adarshavaadi maanate hai ki yadi shaareerik aavashyaktaaon kii purti na kii gayi to maansik kriya bhi duhsadhay ho jaayegi
 a person can move towards self-realization only when his physical development has taken place
 atah bhautik jagat kaa gyaan aavashyak he
 According to the Greek philosopher Plato, the ultimate goal of education is the attainment of God
 atah paathyakram main unheen vishyon ko sammilit karne par bal dena chahie jiske madhyam se ukt lakshya ko praapt kiya ja sake
 To achieve this goal, it is necessary to first achieve the three elements Satya, Shiva and Sundar
 ye teenon aadhyatmik mulya manushya kii kramshah bauddhik, naitik evam kalatmak kriyaaon ke dwaara praapt hote hai
 Therefore, Plato emphasizes on the inclusion of the same subjects and activities in the curriculum that will give the human skill in the above mentioned actions
 unhone bauddhik kriyaaon ke liye bhashaa, sahitya, itihaas, bhugol, ganit tathaa shaareerik vigyaan ko mahatvapurn bataaya he
 Dharma, ethics, and theology for moral activities and various arts and music were included for artistic activities
 adarshavaadi vichaarak horn mahoday paathyakram ke nirdhaaran main thos aadhaaron ko adarsh samaaj ke antargat vyakti ke charitra main khojate hai
 Therefore, according to him all those experiences, actions and living conditions etc
 that lead us to the perfection of the ideal
 unheen ko paathyakram main mahatvapurn sthaan dena chaiye
 His idea is- duusare shabdon main unhone gyanoparjan evam jivicoparjan se sambandhit vishyon ko paathyakram main sammilit karne kii sifarish kii he
 German academician Harbart emphasizes character and moral development for the spiritual advancement of man and for that, language, literature, history, art and music are the main places in the curriculum
 unke anusaar paathyakram main bhugol, ganit tathaa vigyaan ko gaun sthaan dena chaiye
 Although TP Nun has strongly supported the individualistic objective of education, he is an advocate of idealistic ideology in relation to curriculum construction
 unka vichaar he ki vidhyalay kaa kartavya ek nishchit prakaar kii aupchaarik shiksha dena maatr nahin he apitu uskaa kartavya he ki vah apane samaaj evam raashtra kii aadhyatmik shakti kii unnati main sahyog pradaan karen
 Keep its historical order and cultures safe and make a successful effort to make its future bright
 atah vidhyalay main balak ko do pramukh kriyaaon ke liye prashikshit kiya jaan chahie-ek ve kriyaayen jo balak ke vaiyaktik evam saamaajik jivan kii unnati karen tathaa duusari ve kriyaayen jo maanviya sabhyataa ke praarambhik swaroop kaa nirdhaaran karen
 In a nutshell, it is said that according to the idealistic ideology, there should be no mobility in the curriculum of education, so that changes can be made to the needs of the children
 is drushti se adarshavaadi apane paathyakram main jahaan ek taraf shaareerik shiksha ko mahatv dete hai, vahiin duusari taraf prakritik vaataavaran kii jaankaree ke liye bhautikee, rasayaniki, bhumiti bhugol, khagol, bhugarbha vigyaan, vanaspatishaastra, jeev vigyaan ityadi vishyon ko bhi mahatv dete hai
 For the spiritual development of the child, subjects like art, literature, ethics, religious philosophy, music etc
 are considered more idealistic
 praayah logon kaa aisa vichaar he ki adarshavaad shiksha ke lakshya evam uddeshyon kaa nirdhaaran karata he, shikshan paddati kaa nahin
 But the reality is that idealism does not disregard the education system, with more emphasis on the objectives and ideals of education
 adarshavaadi vichaardhaara ke anusaar shikshan paddati aisi honi chaiye jisase balak ke vyaktitv kaa vikaas ho sake
 Any teaching method can be said to be good only if it can prove helpful in imparting knowledge to children keeping in view their intelligence, ability, interest, strength, strength and need
 adarshavaad ke anusaar yadi vyakti ek baar spasht rup se shiksha kaa uddeshy nishchit kar letaa he to phir yah gaun ho jaataa he ki vah kin paddatiyon ke sahare un uddeshyon ko praapt karegaa
 Therefore, when the method is suitable for the teacher or learner, then there is no harm in adopting it
 isiilie vah khel paddati ko apnaane main bhi sankoch nahin karata he
 Frobel regarded the teaching method as basically 'self-motivated action'
 khel dwaara shiksha bhi aatm kriya dwaara shiksha kaa hi ek bhed he
 Regarding sports, Froebel has written - 'sports is a mirror for the child under him and outside the world
 yah jivan evam lagan shakti ko abhivyakti karne vaali pravriti he
 ' adarshavaadi pracheen sahitya kaa aadar karte hai
 They believe that the knowledge discovered by the ancestors is full of our ancient literature, we should benefit from it
 pracheen sahitya ke adhyayan ke liye ve ‘swadhyay vidhi’ ke pakshdhar hai
 But this method can only be used at a higher level of education
 paashchaatya adarshavaadi vichaarkon ne anek shikshan-vidhiyon kaa vikaas kiya he
 Nowadays there is a special discussion of 'Q & A' method
 sucraat jaise adarshavaadi ne is vidhi kaa prayog isa se 450 varsh purv kiya tha
 Socrates' teaching was based on dialogue with appropriate questions
 sucraat ke shishy plato ne bhi sukaraati vidhi kaa hi anusaran kiya
 Plato developed the dialogue method based on the Q&A method
 plato ne apni adhikansh rachanaayen bhi samvaad ke rup main likhi hai
 Aristotle, a disciple of Plato, used to emphasize the 'arrival' and incorporation methods
 nigaman vidhi main ‘saamaanya se vishesh kii ore’ tathaa aagaman vidhi main ‘vishesh se saamaanya kii ore jate hai
 Among modern idealist philosophers, Hegel showed his interest in 'logic-method', pastology as 'practice-method' and René decarte moving from 'simple to complex'
 adarshavaadi ‘vyaakhyaan vidhi’ athwa adhyayan vidhi ko upekshaniya nahin samajhataa
 Real experience is superior, but it is impossible for human to get knowledge of all the things of the world through direct experience
 atah duusare ke anubhav se laabh uthaane main adarshavaadi koi haani nahin dekhtaa
 Therefore, there is no hesitation in adopting the lecture method anywhere
 vah samuhik charchaa kaa bhi aashray letaa he or mahatvapurn vishyon ko spasht karne ke liye vaad-vivaad vidhi kaa aashray lene kii salaah detaa he
 While the idealist proposes to teach infants through 'katha Vidhi', he advocates giving education to teenagers through 'play-method' and 'conversation-method'
 harbart ne naveen gyaan ko vidhyaarthiyon tak pahunchaane ke liye ‘panchapadi’ kaa aashray liya he
 According to the famous idealist pastology, the teaching method 44 should correspond to the development of the brain and he has called his method as 'anashang'
 pastalaji ne apni vidhi kaa saar sankhya, rup evam bhashaa bataaya he
 Naturalists consider the teacher to be negligible in teaching and advises them to remain behind the scenes
 adarshavaadi vichaarak thik iske vipareet kehete hai
 According to idealism, the teacher's position is paramount in the teaching process
 shikshan-prakriya yantrik nahin hoti
 In this, one personality has influence on another
 balak jo antatah vyakti he – na ki sharir, uskaa vikaas prabhaavshaalee vyaktitv dwaara hi sambhav he
 Therefore, the personality of the teacher should be influential
 janm ke samay balak main anek shaktiyaan sushupt hoti hai
 The teacher's task is to awaken these latent powers
 bhartiya adarshavaad main shikshak ko sarvottam sthaan dete hue unhen ‘tridev’ kii sangya dete hue kaha gaya he ki – ‘gururbrahma, gururvishnuh, gururdevo maheshwarah’ arthath guru hi brahma, vishnu tathaa maheshwar he
 Similarly, in the 'brahmacharya Sukta' of the Atharvaveda, it is said in relation to the Acharya that 'acharyas Mrityavarunah, Som Oshadhayyah - usually
 ’ arthath guru puraane sanskaron ko nasht karke naveen sanskaar daalata he or balak ko naveen jivan pradaan karata he, isliye vah mrityurvarun kaha gaya he
 The Guru washes away the mischiefs of the mind, hence he is called Varuna
 vah shaanti ke maarg par le jaataa he
 Therefore, he was given the name of medicine because of the similar to Som and to overcome from diseases like difficulty
 isliye adarshavaadi vichaarak balak ke aantarik athwa aadhyatmik vikaas ke liye shikshak kii aavashyaktaa par bal dete hai
 In education system, the teacher is the guide of the student's life
 vah unhen uchit maarg-darshan karke uski swaabhaavik shaktiyon ko uchit disha main viksit karne kaa avasar pradaan karata he
 Teacher is the axis of teaching
 uske bina shikshan-prakriya adhuri rahegi
 Ideals and goals and values of life are already in place
 plato ke anusaar inkaa pehle se hi astitv he
 It is the responsibility of the teacher to strive for the development of a child-oriented personality so that they can achieve their goals easily
 is prakaar adarshavaadi vichaarak balak ko prakritik praani se saamaajik evam aadhyatmik praani main parivartit karne ke liye shikshak kii aavashyaktaa par adhik bal dete hai
 The well-known idealist Frobel has described the need of teacher Hwpi Mali for the best development of a child-friendly plant in the garden garden
 ross ne adarshavaad ke anusaar ‘shikshaarthi’ ke samuchit vikaas ke liye ‘shikshak’ ke sthaan kaa nirupan karte hue likhaa he- It is because of the teacher's extreme importance that most scholars term idealistic education as 'teacher centered education'
 adarshavaad main anushaasan ko upyukt shiksha ke liye aavashyak samajha jaataa he
 Idealist thinkers are rigid biases in education
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar balak ko purna swatantraaa nahin deni chahie
 There are different views in this regard between idealism and naturalism
 prakrutivaadee shiksha-swatantraaa main adhik vishwaas rakhte hai
 Whereas in idealistic education- discipline
 is sambandh main thomas evam laing ne likhaa he-‘‘prakrutivaadiyon kaa naaraa’’ swatantraaa he
 Whereas the idealist slogan is discipline
 ’’ adarshavaadi vichaarak maanate hai ki balak ko purna swatantrata dene se to haani kii hi sambhaavna adhik he, laabh kii kam
 Therefore, limited freedom should be provided to the child
 adarshavaad anushaasan par bal avashya detaa he kintu vah damanaatmak anushaasan ke paksh main nahin he kyonki kathor niyantran main rakhkar or damankaaree sadhano dwaara sthapit anushaasan kaa parinaam praayah bhayankar hota he
 Therefore, the form of discipline is effective
 iske liye adarshavaad naitik gunon ke vikaas ko mahatv detaa he
 For the development of moral qualities, it is necessary to develop qualities like humility, honesty, punctuality, obedience, truthfulness etc
 which are possible only in a disciplinary environment
 adarshavaadi dharna main balak main anushaasan kii sthapana ‘aatm-prerit ruchi’ ke vikaas se hi sambhav he kyonki balak kii jisamen swayan kii ruchi hoti he, usee ko grahan karata he ruchi ek prakaar kii nishchayatmak pravriti hone ke kaaran vyakti ke bheetar se utpann hoti he
 Since discipline is based on interest
 atah isaki prerana bhi bheetar se milti he
 There is no place for frivolity, euphoria or indiscipline in the work which a person will do with self-confidence
 vahaan swaabhaavik rup se anushaasan sthapit ho jaayoga
 Another belief of idealism in relation to discipline is that it cannot be established by award or punishment
 balak koi acha kaary puraskaar ke lobh main aakar nahin karata
 The award for virtues should also not be arranged in the school
 satya bolne ke liye kisi praskaar kii zarurat nahin he
 This is human duty only
 ise to karnaa hi chaiye
 The child does some work because he has genuine interest in that work and he also gets real pleasure from it
 is prakaar balak main ‘aatmanushasan’ kii neenv padati he or kaalaantar main vah anushaasit rahata he
 According to the idealistic pastology, sympathy should be taken towards the child
 frobel ke anusaar balak ke upar niyantran uski ruchi ke gyaan ke aadhaar par tathaa sahanubhuti evam prem ke prakaashan dwaara karnaa chaiye, kyonki anushaasan kii prerana to bheetar se milti he
 In confirmation of this opinion, it seems reasonable to state that the discipline of 'honor' starts out externally but ends internally by self-control
 ’ An object, action or idea is evaluated on the basis of any pre-determined criteria
 ye mandand vyaktigat bhi ho sakate hai or saamaajik bhi, manovaigyanik bhi ho sakate hai or vaigyanik bhi, alpamaanya bhi ho sakate hai or bahumanya bhi
 The more objective the criterion is, the more individuals are accepted
 vah utana hi adhik acha mandand mana jaataa he
 Similar efforts have been made here and idealistic education has been evaluated on the basis of the present circumstances and aspirations and aspirations of the Indian society
 yadi uparyukt varnit shiksha ke vibhinn angon ke sambandh main adarshavaadiyon dwaara prastut vichaaron ke sandarbh main adarshavaad kaa moolyankan karen to hamen uske bahut se gun evam dosha kaa pataa chalata he
 Following are the effects, qualities or contributions of idealism in the context of education: adarshavaadiyon ne shiksha ke jin uddeshyon ko prastaavit kiya he, unase baalkon ke uttam charitra kaa nirmaan hota he
 He has considered a remarkable aim of education to develop the qualities of Satya, Shiva and Sundar among children, which are the pillars of good character
 shiksha ke uddeshyon kaa nirdhaaran karne main adarshavaad ne atyadhik mahatvapurn bhoomika prastut kii he
 According to idealistic thinkers, a child is born as a classical creature with some basic tendencies and education is the main tool to make him a cultured member of society
 atah ve shiksha ke uddeshyon par vistrut rup se vichaar karte hai
 Idealism gives the teacher a paramount place in education
 isse shiksha-jagat main shikshak ko gauravpurn sthaan praapt hota he saath hi balak or samaaj donon ke hit ke liye atyaavashyak he
 Idealism has given such principles of 'self-control' and 'self-control' which can be followed by solving the problem of increasing indiscipline and stress among students today
 adarshavaadi shiksha main vyakti or samaaj donon ke hit ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vyaktigat evam saamaajik mulyon ko samaan mahatv diya gaya he
 Idealism has given importance to both the poles in the education process ie teacher and learner by respecting the personality of the child in his education plan
 adarshavaad se hi prabhavit hokar aaj sabhi log baalkon ke ‘adarsh vyaktitv’ par bal dete hai
 Idealistic education lays greater emphasis on the development of spiritual, religious and moral qualities
 adarshavaadi shiksha main uparyukt gunon ke hote hue katipay dosha bhi paye jate hai- The objectives of idealism that education has set are so 'abstract' and subtle that it is very difficult for a person of common intelligence to understand them
 ye amoort evam sookshm uddeshy vartmaan se sambandhit na hokar bhavishya se sambandhit hote hai
 This philosophy gives priority to the teacher and ideal rather than the child and its nature and thus modern ideas related to 'child centered education', 'child centered curriculum' and 'child centered teaching method' are ignored

 The traditional method of counting has been to continuously increment a "count" for each element of a set in one sequence, while still marking those elements so that the element is not presented more than once
 Ho, unless there are no undetected elements left; If the counter was placed on one after the first object, then the value that comes after meeting the last object gives the desired number of elements

 yah upyogi sabit hota he jab vastuon ko samay ke saath baar-baar ginana ho, jaise ki puure din main koi chiz kitne baar hui ho
 Matches are monolithic calculations; The normal count is in base 10

 At the same time special attention was paid to the means of transport and construction of habitat

 He became the leading country in the manufacture of tractors, rail engines
 yahi vajah he ki naaji akraman ke dauraan rus ne uskaa safaltaapurvak saamana kiya

 Before he began putting his ideas together, he talked with Damon Lindelof, executive producer of LAST, with whom he had worked at the crossing for three years
 Kring thanks Lindelof for his measures in which he explained how to perform the series on the network and gave feedback on the experiences he had learned while working on the series drama
 The two still negotiate and assist each other's projects
 When Kring told the NBC network about Heroes' plan, he described the network's response as "exciting 


 very good
" He says that he has been a partner with NBC for some time based on running Crossing Jordan as a show-runner for six years
 When he narrated the plan, he described everything in depth, including the mysterious ending
 When the NBC officer asked them what was going to happen next, Kring replied "you just wait and find out
" After the project was approved, a special 73-minute version of the first episode was screened in front of a large audience at the 2006 Comic Con in San Diego
 Initially it was stated that this non-proliferated pilot would not be released, yet it was included in the DVD set of the first season

 When the writing team works on an episode, each writer takes a character and writes the lone scenes around it
 These stories are then added and the episodes are given to the writer
 The system allows each writer to contribute to each episode and enables the writing team to finish the script early so that shooting crews can shoot more scenes at one location
 Tim Kring considers the writing process to be collaborative and says that the collaboration process is important because the production has to shoot multiple scenes in one place
 To do this, several scripts must be prepared
 Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explains that this process is important in a series drama because it is important to know in which direction each character is moving

 In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, producer Tim Kring commented on criticisms from the two seasons and a 15% drop in the series' ratings
 Kring said he made mistakes directing season two
 He thought audiences were looking to "develop the characters and discover their powers", as opposed to season one, when viewers were looking for "thrills"
 Kring also stated that he had problems with the development of the story, stating that the second season "took too much time to become a big story", describing that Peter's hypothesis of a final battle from the viral in the first episode rather than the seventh Should have been He believes that in the context of the main story, it would have been better to bring new characters, such as Eli, instead of a separate story of Maya and Alejandro
 Kring also admitted that he was called "heroes in Japan" The story should have ended more quickly and also that the romantic stories are not going well
 With reference to Claire and West and Heroes and Yeko, he said, "I have seen more believable romance on TV
 In that context, i don't think romance is a natural fit for us

 In November 2008, NBC fired Jesse Alexander and Jeff Loeb from the production staff at Heroes due to creative differences and budget problems
 As a result, Tim Kring had to refocus on the development of the characters and the simple story series

 Character-based stories were refused to continue

 " Barry Garren of The Hollywood Reporter also stated, "heroes is one of tv's most imaginative creations and, with luck, could become this year's Lost
" Less favorable reviews also include the Philadelphia Inquirer's comment that although the show had many "good effects", it had "nothing but a pile of blatant nonsense and tardy dialogue
" After the season one episode ended, the Chicago Tribune even went on to say, "you can watch the first few episodes of Heroes, or you can blow your forehead on the wall
