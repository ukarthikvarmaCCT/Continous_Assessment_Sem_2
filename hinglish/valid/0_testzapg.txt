 Due to these unnecessary effects, the use of the medicine should not be stopped, as these effects automatically decrease with time and general precautions can be taken to prevent them, such as: - schizophrenia kaa rogi mukhya lakshanon ke dur hone ke baad dawa lete hue bilkul saamaanya jivan ji saktaa he

 Schizophrenia is often described as a positive and negative symptom
 sakaaratmak lakshan shabd un lakshanon ko suchit karata hai jiskaa anubhav aam taur par adhikansh vyakti nahin karte hai lekin ve schizophrenia main upasthit rahete hai
 They include false delusions, auditory hallucinations and thinking disorders, and are specifically considered to be manifestations of psychosis

 In concurring with this observation, psychologists Edgar Jones and psychiatrists Tony David and Nasser Ghaemi supervised the literature on the fallacy, pointing out that there has been a great deal of desire for people to find the symmetry and completeness of the definition of false illusion, false Illusions are neither necessarily static, nor is it wrong, nor are there current controllable events

 Despite the "base effect" in general, recent findings have shown that during schizophrenia in many individuals, high emotional responses, especially strained or negative senses, and susceptibility to such a pathology also cause a similar prevalence of symptoms
 kuch udhaaharan yah sujhaate hai ki aspasht vishwaas kii vishaywastu or manovikruti kaa anubhav bhaawanaaon ke kaaran vikaar ke rup main pradarshit ho saktaa he or ek vyakti apane anubhavon ko kis prakaar vyakhya karata he iske lakshanon ko prabhavikat karata he
 The use of "safe habits" to keep its losses out is helpful in the order of its perceptions
 manovaigyanik pranali kii bhoomika ke udhaaharan par aage aata he upachaaron kaa prabhaav jo sizophrenia ke lakshanon par hota he
 Studies by neurological psychological tests and brain modeling techniques such as fmri and PET to test for functional differences in brain function have shown that differences are mostly found in the frontal / anterior part of the brain, hippocampus, and temporal parts

 Specific attention has been focused on the functioning of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain

 This concept also confirms the fact that amphetamines, which increase the secretion of dopamine, can worsen psychiatric symptoms in the event of schizophrenia
 ek prabhavali avadharana, jise sizophrenia kaa dopamine sidghant bhi kehete hai, ke anusaar D2 abhigrahakon kaa atyadhik sakriy hona sizophrenia kaa kaaran hota he
 Although common among all psychiatric resistance effects, D2 inhibition was thought to be the same for 20 years until PET and SPET impersonation studies in the mid-1990s provided convincing evidence

 The fact that glutamate receptors are less effective means that the tests to detect the function of the frontal / forebrain and hippocampal are not accurate, and that glutamate affects the functioning of dopamine, all of these in schizophrenia
 , Which has been shown to be an important mediator in the role of glutamate pathways in schizophrenia

 However, according to these studies, the average change in volume is close to the measurement range set by MRI methods, so it is naïve to determine that schizophrenia is a neurological process that is weighty when symptoms appear
 Or that it is better to consider it a process of neurological development in which an abnormal amount of brain is produced at an early age

 The author states that in schizophrenia two networks of the white matter tract may be affected, which is likely to 'break down' the gray matter regions to which they are attached

 However, in the context of the side effects of psychiatric obstructive treatment, the treatment of those who have never been diagnosed with schizophrenia, especially in those with symptoms of dysfiguring tardive dyskinesia, and in rare but far more lethal neuroleptic malignant syndrome
 The most commonly used health safeguards for the prevention of schizophrenia have taken the form of public awareness campaigns informing about the risks and early symptoms, aimed at detecting the disease and giving early treatment to those who delay treatment

 The response to the drug is different: a term like medical resistance schizophrenia is used when the symptoms of two different antipsychotics are not found right
 This category of patients may be given clozapine, a drug that had the right effect but had a variety of postoperative effects including agranulocytosis and myocarditis
 Clozapine has a tendency to decrease disease in schizophrenic patients

 Due to the geographical distance separating it from the other tournaments, the top American and European players rarely deigned to travel down to the Antipodes until the end of the 1970s, meaning that the title was almost exclusively won by Australians up until that date
 In 1972, The Australian Tennis Federation decided to change the venue of the event every year, with Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and even New Zealand taking turns to host the tournament
 In 1983, the Australian Open set up home in Kooyong, Melbourne, where it began to earn the respect of the tennis-playing world until its move in 1988 to Flinders Park
 Grass courts made way for hard rebound ace surfaces, and in 1997, Flinders Park was renamed Melbourne Park
 Since 1988, the Australian Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to have two courts covered by retractable roofs

 Rajendra Prasad · Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan · Zakir Hussain · v ॰ v ॰ Giri † · Muhammad Hidayatullah † · v ॰ v ॰ Giri · Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed · Basappa Dnappa Jatti † · Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy · Zail Singh · Ramaswamy Venkataraman · Shankardayal Sharma Narayanan · Abdul Kalam · Pratibha Devisingh Patil · Pranab Mukherjee · Ram Nath Kovind bhashaa vigyaan main, samoohvachak sangya vah shabd he jiskaa istemaal vastuon ke samooh ko paribhaashit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, va jisamen vyakti, pashu, bhavanaaen, nirjeev vastu, avadharanaen yaa anya chijen ho sakati he
 For example, in the phrase "a pride of lions", pride is a collective noun
 zyaadaatar samoohvachak sangya kaa prayog rosemara kii baatcheet main hota he, jaise ki "group" shabd bahut aam shabd he or yah kisi ek prakaar kii mul vastu kaa bhaan nahin karaata
 udhaaharan ke liye, "group of pipal", "group of dogs" or "group of idiaj" sahi hai
 Others, especially words that belong to a much larger subclass of group nouns known as the terms of venery, denote objects of the same type of race
 udhaaharan ke liye, pashuon ke sandarbh me "pride" shabd sher ko darshata he, na ki kutton yaa lamaaon ko
 Collective nouns should not be combined with collective nouns or collective grammatical numbers
 bahut saare samuhik shabdon ke liye vyutpatti kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Because etymology is a slower and less useful process of word formation than the open syntactic morphological method, very few are thus grouped
 arth kii drushti se vyutpatti sambandhi samoohvachak shabd mul shabdon se aksar alag hote hai, jaisaa ki sabhi vyutpad shabdon ke saath hota he, ye nae sanketarth or nae vaacharth banaate hai
 In English, the words ending in -edge and -day often denote grouping
 kabhi-kabhi ye sambandh aasaani se pahchaanane yogya hote he: bagez, drenez, blocade 
 haalanki, agar vyutpatti vigyaan ke madhyam se dekha jaae to vyutpann shabd ek bahut hi vishesh arth kaa vahan karte hai
 The Germans use the ge-prefix to form groupers
 mul shabd aksar umalayut or pratyay lagaae jate hai saath main jeei- upsarg bhi
 lagbhag sabhi tarah kii sangya ko is tarah napunsak ling hai
 Examples of these are as follows: samoohvachak sangya ke do achche udhaaharan hai "team" or "government", ye donon shabd logon ke samoohon ko darshaate hai
 Both "team" and "government" are numbered nouns
 , "tu tims", "most tims", "van governments", "tu governments", "meni governments" 
 haalanki, is tathy se aksar bhram paidaa hota he ki angreji main in sankhyavachak sangyaaon ke ekvachan rup ke saath bahuvachan kriya roopon kaa hameshaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he, jaisaa ki bahut saare deshon main hota he )
 iske vipareet, un ekvachan kriya roopon main hameshaa sangyaaon ke ant main "-es" kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he jinhen ek baar bahuvachan maan liya gaya tha 
 isse saaf he "bemail sankhya" vastav main maanviya bhashaa kii prakritik or taarkik visheshta he or isaki prakriya shabdon main antarnihit vichaar kaa ek sookshm lakshanalankarik parivartan he
 In British English, it has been accepted that collective nouns can be taken as a singular or plural form of a verb, depending on the symptomatic inflection of the context and its meaning
 udhaaharan ke liye, "da team ij in da dressing room" ) main team ko ek samooh darshata he, jabaki "da team aar fiting amang demselwj" )) team ko vyakti ke rup main darshata he
 In British English this also happens with the names of countries and cities in the context of sports; For example, "germany Have One Competition", "madrid Have Lost Three Consecutive Matches" etc
 In American English, collective nouns generally use the singular verb form, but where the noun is understood as a group of individuals, the singular or plural verb is correct in American usage
 aise maamalon main jahaan ek lakshanalankarik parivartan duusari tarah se aa jaataa he, tab ho saktaa he ki lakshanankar se bachane ke liye puure vaakya ko phir se taiyaar karnaa pad jaae
 "da team members aar fiting amang demselwj" yaa keval "da team ij fiting" ho saktaa he
 ) See American and British English Differences - Formal and Notational Agreement
 aise lakshanalankarik parivartan kaa ek acha udhaaharan ekvachan se bahuvachan main parivartan vaale nimnlikhit vaakya main he dwaara janaa jaataa he) "da team haev phinishd da project" 
 is vaakya main antarnihit vichaar yah he ki ek project ko puraa karne ke liye samooh ke prayek sadsy ek saath kaam kar rahe hai
 Their achievement is collective and the emphasis is not on separate identities, yet at the same time they are also separated; The selection of the term "team Have" manages to convey their collectiveness and their separate identities at the same time
 aise lakshanalankarik parivartan kaa acha udhaaharan nimnlikhit vaakya main bahuvachan se ekvachan main he: "mathematics ij maai favorit acadmic subject" 
 mathematic udhyam kehane kii mul avadharana main "mathematics" shabd bahuvachan main ho saktaa he, lekin lakshanalankarik parivartan—vah yah ki yah avadharana "udhyam" se "udhyam kii puri pravriti" main parivartit ho jaati he—isse ekvachan ikai ke rup se mathematics kaa prayog ekvachan kriya rup main ho jaataa he
 Under the same rules that apply to other collective nouns, the plural verb of singular pronouns for nominal can be taken as a collective noun

 Charcoal, or Kathkoyla or charcoal, is a black-brown, impermeable, solid substance that is made by heating wood, bone, etc
 in the absence of oxygen and extracting water and other volatile substances from it
 is kriya ko "ushmavighatan" kehete hai
 Charcoal contains high amounts of carbon
 yah lakdi ko 400 °C se 700 °C tak hawa kii anupasthiti main garam karke banaaya jaataa he
 Its calorigenic value ranges from 29,000 to 35,000 kj / kg, which is much higher than the calorigenic value of wood
 charcol kaa upyog dhaatukarm main eendhan ke rup main, audyogic eendhan ke rup main, khaane banane ke indhan ke rup main, barood nirmaan ke liye, shuddhikaran or filtaran ke liye, kalakaari, chikitsa, aadi ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Burning wood in insufficient amount of air leaves the flammable part in the form of gas and the black solid object, called Kathkoya, remains
 yah carbon naamak tatv kaa hi ek ashuddh rup he, jisamen kuch anya tatv bhi alp maatra main rahete hai
 Despite the physical and chemical properties of wood, the texture of the wood from which it is obtained remains preserved
 sukhi lakdi ko 310 degree sein tak tapt karne par pehle vah halke, tatpashchaat gadhe bhure rang kii tathaa antat: kaali or jalane yogya ho jaati he
 Kathkoya is obtained at higher temperatures than this
 is ushmavighatan kii kriya main kuch ati upyogi vastuon kaa bhi utpaadan hota he
 Firstly, water vapor comes out, but the initial dissolution on increasing the temperature also gives carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide
 adhik taap par ushmakshepak kriya prarambh hoti he or alkatraa, amla tathaa methil alcohol ityadi kaa aswan hota he or kathkoyala shesh rah jaataa he
 Once this action starts, the heat of the reaction is sufficient to run the carbonization process and there is no need to heat it from outside
 gharelu athwa duusare kaaryon main irdhann ke liye kathkoyale kaa upyog bahut pracheen he
 Several methods of preparing it in commercial quantities are used
 praarambhik vidhi main lakdi ko ek gadde yaa gol dher main is prakaar sajaakar ekatrit kar liya jaataa he ki bich main dhuaan athwa vighatan se bani hui gas ke nikalne ke liye maarg rahe
 The entire heap is covered with soil and lump, including grass thatch
 bheetar kii lakdi jalaane ke liye chimney se jalati hui luaathi daal di jaati tathaa dher kii jad main sthit, hawa ke pravesh ke liye bane chhidr khol die jate hai
 Initially the heat produced by the burning of a little wood helps to burn the remaining wood
 kai dinon baad, jab chimney se prakashprad lau ke sthaan par halki neeli lau dikhaai dene lagati he tab neeche ke chhidr band kar, kathkoyale ko thanda hone ke liye chhod diya jaataa he
 In this method, about 24 percent of Kathkoya is obtained, but there is a loss due to the addition of many useful volatile substances into the air
 kai deshon main, visheshkar jahaan lakdi sasti he, abhi bhi isi vidhi dwaara kathkoyala banaaya jaataa he
 From the 18th century onwards, kilns made of Etaw and iron buckles began to be used
 bakbhaand ko saamanyatya baahar se garam kiya jaataa he tathaa utpann gas ko sanghnitr main pravaahit kar upyogi upjaat ekatrit kar liya jaataa he
 The remaining gas is used to heat the noises
 praapt padaarthon se lakdi kii spirit, pirolignius amla, jisase methil alcohol, acetone tathaa aseetic amla banate hai, tathaa alkatraa miltaa he
 These are separated by distillation
 kahin-kahin in bahumoolya upjaaton ke liye hi lakdi kaa carbonikaran karte hai
 Deciduous tree wood is preferred for greater production of acetic acid and methyl alcohol
 utpaadan mulya ghataane ke vichaar se kuch deshon main nalika-bhatthi athwa lambii belanaakaar lohe kii urdhwadhar bhatthi kaa upyog hota he or carbonikaran ke praapt jalansheel gas hi inhen garam karne ke kaam main laai jaati he
 In the United States, wooden cans filled with rails are entered inside the cook and are taken out at the end of the process
 iton se bana yah bhattha madhumakhi ke chhatey ke aakaar kaa hota he
 Wood is lit from the summit
 lakdi jalaakar patt se mitti kaa lep dekar munh band kar dete hai
 Wood is poured from some of its low passages
 bhatthe ke pede ke tal par ek maarg hota he, jisase koyala nikaala jaataa he
 And are made of iron plate
 ye patt iton se lohe ke ek chipte chakkar dwaara, mitti se lepakar, band kar die jate hai
 There are holes around the kiln, which can be closed, or kept open, as needed
 chuulhe ke pende se nikaas maarg dwaara gesen or vaashp nikalate hai
 There is an air and pustulence in it
 aise upkarnon main acchhee koti kaa koyala banataa he
 The collection of volatile components is of secondary importance
 thande ho jane par inase koyala nikaala jaataa he
 It takes enough time to cool down
 kathkoyala kaale rang kaa thos padaarth he, jo peetane par chur ho jaataa he
 Due to its concentration, it has a lot of exploitation power
 yah vayumandal se vaashp tathaa vividh prakaar ke gaison kii maatra sokh letaa he
 This power is greatly increased upon activating the Kathkoyle
 isi kaaran saadhaaran kathkoyale main bhi shoshit hawa kii acchhee maatra milti he
 Although the actual relative density of airless Kathkoyle is between 1
3 to 1
9, but the virtual density is found to be between 0
2 to 0
5
 kathkoyala bhi lakdi kii bhanti pani par tairta he
 Compared to wood, it is more resistant to the effects from which wood rot or decay
 isi kaaran lakdi ke latthon kii upree sataha ko jalaakar gaadne athwa rakhane ke bheetar kaa bhaag bahut samay tak surakshit rah jaataa he
 Kathkoya burns a colorless flame on heating in air, in which carbon dioxide gas is formed and little ash remains, which is alkaline
 is kriya main atyadhik garmi nikalati he, jiske kaaran irdhann ke rup main kathkoyale kaa adhik upyog hota he
 The powder of Kathkoyle is used in various combinations of gunpowder and fireworks
 irdhann ke atirikt, vifailli gaison se bachane ke liye gasamask tathaa ushma avarohak banane main iskaa prayog hota he
 The use of Kathkoyle in a gasmask, or to remove certain objects from solutions, depends on its exploitation power
 kuch vastuon se anichhit gandh yaa rang dur karne main sakriyakrut kathkoyala atyadhik prayukt hota he
 Oxygen exploited in such coal vessels reacts with the exploited toxic gas, converting the toxic gas into harmless gases
 aar
 austrico ne san 1900 ke kuch pehle hi pataa laga liya tha ki bhaap kii dhara main kathkoyale ke chatak laal taap tak garam karne se kathkoyale kii shoshanshakti bahut bad jaati he
 Such Kathkoyle is called activated Kathkoyla
 san 1916 ke baad sakriyakrut kathkoyala banane kii gai reetiyaan avishkrut huin
 The gas masks of the Second World War required a more activated kathakoyle
 tab anusandhanon dwaara pataa laga ki pathar ke koyale ko vishesh taap tak tapt karke usapar bhaap pravaahit karne se saste main acha sakriyakrut koyala praapt ho saktaa he

 Palaces, temples and residential buildings were built at high places in this fort and flat land was used for agricultural work

 Within this fort there is another stronghold known as Katargarh

 Maharana Udai Singh was also nurtured by Panna Dhay hiding in this fort
 haldi ghati ke yuddh ke baad maharana pratap bhi kaaphi samay tak isi durg main rahe
 The attack on it started only after the formation of this fort, but except for one time, this fort has remained invincible, but there are also many sad incidents of this fort, which no one could defeat Maharana Kumbha, the same Paramvir Maharana Kumbha was this fort
 Killed in the kingdom Lipsa by his son Udaya Karna

 Mad singers often sing songs in praise of this fort: cegorbe kaa girjaghar, , ek roman catholic girjaghar he
 It is present in Segorbe, Castillon, Spain

 It was granted the status of a small basilica in 1985
 is girjaghar se judaa ek sangrahalay he jahaan kai sthaneey or videshi kalakaaron ke chitra dikhaai dete hai
 International Gothic art, fifteenth to seventeenth century paintings, sixteenth century Valencia ideology and its later paintings can be seen
 jinka kalakaaron ke kaam yahan dikhaae gaye hai vah is tarah hai: Braj Bhasha is basically the dialect of Braj region

 Ever since Gokul became the center of the Vallabh sect, literature related to Krishna began to be written in Braj Bhasha

 From the famous Mahakavi Mahatma Surdas of Bhaktikal to the famous poet Shri Viyogi Hari of modern times, the poetry of Braj and Muktak poetry were composed from time to time
 janapadiya jivan ke prabhaav se brajabhasha ke kai rup hamen drushtigochar hote hai
 But with a slight difference we can see a clear glimpse of uniformity in them
 brajabhasha kii apni rupagat prakruti aukarant he arthath isaki ekvachaneey puling sangyaayen tathaa visheshan praaia: aukarant hote hai; jaise khurpu, yamrau, maanjhu aadi sangya shabd aukarant hai
 Similarly, the adjective terms karau, gorau, savanrau etc
 are immediate
 kriya kaa saamaanya bhootkaalik ekvachan puling rup bhi brajabhasha main pramukhroopen aukarant hi rahata he
 It is different that "Y" Shruti proceeds are also found in some of its areas
 jila aligarh kii tehsil kol kii boli main saamaanya bhootkaaleen rup "y" shruti se rahit miltaa he, lekin jila mathura tathaa dakshini bulandshahr kii tahseelon main "y" shruti avashya pai jaati he
 like : ""karau chhora bolau"" -
 "" Carau Chora Bolou "" -
 ""karau launda bolgau"" -
 Kannauji has its own nature
 sangya, visheshan tathaa kriya ke roopon main brajabhasha jahaan aukarantata lekar chalati he vahaan kannauji okarantata kaa anusaran karti he
 In the district Braj language of Aligarh district, if we say "" Carou Chora Bolou "", then it will be said in Kannauji that - "" Say Caro Lurika
 bhavishyatkaleen kriya kannauji main tidhntaroopini hoti he, lekin brajabhasha main vah kridantarupini pai jaati he
 If we convert the words "boy will go" and "girl will go" into Kannauji and Brajbhasha, we will give the following form: kannauji main - larika jaihai
 Daughter is brajabhasha main - chhora jaigau
 Will be left
 uparyukt udaahranon se spasht he ki brajabhasha ke saamaanya bhavishyat kaal rup main kriya karta ke ling ke anusaar parivartit hoti he, jab ki kannauji main ek rup rahati he
 Apart from this, Kannauji also has a tendency to discolour like Awadhi, which is lacking in Braj Bhasha
 kannauji ke sangya, sarvnaam aadi vaakyapadon main sandhirahitya praaia: miltaa he, kintu brajabhasha main ve pad sandhigat avasthaa main milte hai
 Examples : kannauji -""bau gao"" 
 Brajbhasha - "" Bo Gayou ""
 uparyukt vaakyon ke sarvnaam pad "bau" tathaa "bo" main sandhirahitya tathaa sandhi kii avasthaaen donon bhashaaon kii prakrutiyon ko spasht karti hai
 Keeping in view the linguistic variation of the Braj Bhasha region, we can divide it as follows: kendriya braj arthath adarsh brajabhasha - aligarh, mathura tathaa pashchimi agre kii brajabhasha ko "adarsh brajabhasha" naam diya ja saktaa he
 This name can be given to the language spoken in the north west of Gwalior - Budeli influenced Brajbhasha
 rajasthan kii jaipuri se prabhavit brajabhasha - yah bharatpur tathaa uske dakshini bhaag main boli jaati he
 Sikarwadi Brajbhasha - This form of Brajbhasha is prevalent in the north east region of Gwalior where settlements of Sikarwad Rajputs are found
 jaadobati brajabhasha - karauli ke kshetra tathaa chambal nadi ke maidan main boli janevaali brajabhasha ko "jadobari" naam se pukaara gaya he
 There are settlements of Jadau Rajputs here
 kannauji se prabhavit brajabhasha - jila eta tathaa tehsil anupshahar evam atarauli kii bhashaa kannauji se prabhavit he
 The following examples are visible for how the district Braj language of Braj-speaking region has changed from west to east
 jila gudgaanv main - ""tamaso dekhne ku gaye
 You are getting angry with me

 "" jila bulandshahr main -""launda gom ku ayu or bahu su bolgau kai main naukri ku jangau

 The name CFS is controversial in itself because many patient and support groups, as well as some experts, want a change in name because they believe it does not fully indicate the severity of the disease

 An Australian study found that a subset of individuals met the criteria for CFS after infection by viral and non-viral microbes, leading researchers to conclude that "post-infection fatigue syndrome is a disease of CFS
 Is a valid disease model for examining thematic physiologic pathways "
 However, information is not currently available on its prevalence and the exact roles of infection and stress in the development of CFS

 asaamanya manovigyaan manovigyaan kii vah shakha he jo manushyon ke asaadhaaran vyavhaaron, vichaaron, gyaan, bhaawanaaon or kriyaaon kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karti he
 Unusual or unusual behavior is one that is different from normal or ordinary behavior
 saadhaaran vyavhaar vah he jo bahudhaa dekha jaataa he or jisko dekhakar koi aashcharya nahin hota or na uske liye koi chintaa hi hoti he
 Although there is some characteristic and difference in the behavior of all human beings, which makes one person different from the other, yet unless that attribute is very amazing, no one is bothered by it, nobody pays special attention to it
 par jab kisi vyakti kaa vyavhaar, gyaan, bhaavana, yaa kriya duusare vyaktiyon se vishesh maatra or vishesh prakaar se bhinn ho or itnaa bhinn hoki duusare logon ko vicitra jaan pade to us kriya yaa vyavhaar ko asaamaanya yaa asaadhaaran kehete hai
 Its subject matter is primarily related to studying unplanned behaviors, personality disturbance and disorganized personality and considering their treatment methods
 asaamaanya manovigyaan ke antargat ke antargat aane vaale kuch mahatvapurn vishay hai- There are several types of abnormal psychology: abhavatmak, jisamen kisi aise vyavhaar, gyaan, bhaavana or kriya main se kisi kaa abhaav paaya jaae to saadhaaran yaa saamaanya manushyon main paaya jaataa ho
 Such as lack of any kind of sense knowledge in a person, or lack of sexual orientation or action
 kisi vishesh shakti, gyaan, bhav yaa kriya kii adhikta yaa maatra main vruddhi
 Increase in excess or quantity of a particular power, knowledge, emotion or action
 asaadhaaran vyavhaar se itnaa bhinn vyavhaar ki vah anokhaa or ascharyajanak jaan pade
 For example, we can say that the unusual forms of ordinary sexual behavior can be emotion, sexual impairment, dementia and distorted work
 kisi prakaar kii asaamanyata ho to keval usee vyakti ko ksht or du:kha nahin hota jisamen vah asaamanyata pai jaati he, balki samaaj ke liye bhi vah kshtprad hokar ek samasya ban jaati he
 Therefore abnormality is a major problem for the society
 kaha jaataa he ki sanyukt rajya, america main 10 pratishat vyakti asaamaanya hai, isi kaaran vahaan kaa samaaj samrudh or sab prakaar se sampann hota hua thi sukhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Some abnormalities are such that they do not cause any special harm, they are only a matter of surprise and curiosity, but there are some abnormalities that make a person's own life sad, unsuccessful and unable, but They do not cause any special suffering and harm to others
 unako saadhaaran maansik rog kehete hai
 When mental illness becomes such that it causes fear, sorrow, pain and loss to other people, it is called madness
 paagalpan kii maatra jab adhik ho jaati he to us vyakti ko paagalakhaane main rakhaa jaataa he, taaki vah swatantra rahakar dusron ke liye kshtprad or hanikaarak na ho jaae
 At that time and in countries where there was not much knowledge of psychology, in relation to psychopaths and lunatics, there was a misconception that they had been influenced by ghosts, vampires or havens and they would behave in unusual ways under any of them
 Huh
 unako thik karne ke liye puja paath, mantra tantra or yantra aadi kaa prayog hota tha athwa unako bahut maar petakar unke sharir se bhoot pishaach yaa shaitan bhagaaya jaataa tha
 In modern times, psychology has progressed so much that due to psychiatry, insanity and abnormal behavior of human beings, many people have come to know the form and treatment
 asaamaanya manovigyaan main in vishyon kii vishesh charchaa hoti he : Characterization and identification of abnormality
 saadhaaran maanviya gyaan, kriyaaon, bhaawanaaon or vyaktitv tathaa saamaajik vyavhaar ke anek prakaaron main abhavatmak vikrutiyon ke swaroop, lakshan or kaarnon kaa adhyayan
 Psychiatry in which many types of psychosis are found as their symptoms
 inke hone se vyakti ke aachaar or vyavhaar main kuch vichitrataa aa jaati he, par vah sarvatha nikamma or ayogy nahin ho jaataa
 They can be called simple psychiatry
 aise kisi rog main man main koi vichaar bahut dridhtaa ke saath baith jaataa he or hataae nahin hatataa
 Occasionally and inevitably he keeps coming in the mind of the patient
 kisi main kisi asaamaanya vicitra or akaaran vishesh bhay yada-kada or anivaary rup se anubhav hota rahata he
 The things a normal person is not afraid of, the mental patient is afraid of them
 kuch log kisi vishesh prakaar kii kriya ko karne ke liye, jisaki unako kisi prakaar kii aavashyaktaa nahin, apane andar se itane adhik prerit or baadhya ho jate hai ki unhen kiye bina unako chaiyn nahin padati
 Unusual personality whose expression is expressed in Nana's frenzy
 is rog main vyakti ke swabhaav, vichaaron, bhaavon or kriyaaon main sthirataa, saamanjasy or paristhitiyon ke prati anukulata kaa abhaav, vyaktitv ke gathan kii kami or apni hi kriyaaon or pratikriyaaon par apane niyantran kaa hraas ho jaataa he
 Changes in dualism or personality, moving around sleeping in sleep, forgetting your name, clan and city, taking other names etc
, etc
 is rog kaa rogi, akaaran hi kabhi rone, hansane, bolne lagata he; kabhi chuppi saadh letaa he
 One experiences many kinds of suffering in the body and lack of knowledge in the senses
 na vah swayan sukhi rahata he or na kutub ke logon ko sukhi rahane detaa he
 Severe mental diseases, due to which the human life of a person becomes useless, unsuccessful and unhappy, and it becomes meaningless and terrible for society; It needs to be kept separate from others
 is koti main ye teen rog aate hai : The study of very highly talented and congenital underprivileged individuals also performs unusual psychology
 yadhyapi yah vishwaas bahut purana he ki prayek vyakti kii pratibha kii maatra bhinn hoti he, tathaapi kuch dinon se paashchaatya deshon main manushya kii pratibha kii maatra kii bhinnata ko nirdhaarit karne kii reeti kaa avishkaar ho gaya he
 If the amount of talent of a normal human being is estimated to be 100, then there are 20 to 200 persons of talent in the world
 inamen se 90 se 110 tak kii matraavaalon ko saadhaaran, 90 se kam matraavaalon ko nimna or 110 tak kii matraavaalon ko ucch shrenee kii pratibhavale vyakti kahana hoga
 Many people with very low, low and bright and very high, high and high concentrations will also be found
 in vishesh prakaar kii pratibhawalon ke gyaan, bhav or kriyaaon kaa adhyayan bhi asaamaanya manovigyaan karata he
 Unusual psychology also tries to understand the state of dream, sleep and samadhi, unconsciousness, hypnotic sleep, sleeplessness and sleeplessness from the waking state and know what it has to do with the waking state
 manushya ke saadhaaran jaagrath vyavhaar main bhi kuch aisi vicitra or aakasmik ghatnaayen hoti rahati hai jinke kaarnon kaa gyaan nahin hota or jinpar unke karanevaalon ko swayan vismay hota he
 For example, some unique, unwanted and inappropriate words come out of one's mouth, pen some inappropriate words; Those who have no intention of doing it and who regret doing it, tax such works
 is prakaar kii ghatnaon kaa bhi asaamaanya manovigyaan adhyayan karata he
 Unusual psychology also studies the attitudes of criminals and especially criminals who commit crimes due to weaknesses and mental illnesses of the mind and the motives and desires of their unknown minds
 uparyukt vishyon kaa vaigyanik reeti se adhyayan karnaa asaamaanya manovigyaan kaa kaam he, isapar koi matbhed nahin he; par is vigyaan main is vishay par bada matbhed he ki in asaamaanya or asaadhaaran ghatnaon ke kaaran kya hai
 All of these scientists believe that it is unnecessary and unscientific to believe the influence of ghosts, vampires, devils etc
 in the causes of the origin of psychosis
 unke kaaran to sharir, man or saamaajik paristhitiyon main hi dhundhane honge
 Despite the prevailing multiple views in this regard, three votes can be given priority and they can also be coordinated
 ve ye hai : Chemical degradation or overgrowth of physical elements
 vifaille rasinic tatwon kaa pravesh yaa antarutpaadan or shaareerik angon tathaa avyavon kii, visheshat: mastishk or snaayuon kii, vikruti athwa vinaash
