 The ellipse also polarizes the polarized light to the tourmaline plane, and its intensity also increases by rotating the tourmaline, but it never completely disappears
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke aaptit prakaash main paraspar samakonik, kintu bhinn ayaamon vaale do avyav kampan hote hai or jab q = 0 kii sthiti main ek avyav kaa aayam mahattam hota he tab duusare kaa lop ho jaataa he or q = 90 degree hone par pehle aayam kaa lop hota he or doosraa aayam mahattam ho jaataa he
 Tourmaline cannot change the intensity of polar-polarized light, because its two components vibrations have equal dimensions, ie
 at: isamen bhi adhruvit prakaash kii hi tarah samamiti kaa gun hota he
 Yet it is polarized light
 isko pahchaanane kii yukti aage bataai jaaegi
 The vibrations are simple in line and their direction is constant
 at: ise rekha dhruvit bhi kehete hai
 The reason for the name of the polar plane is that the vibrations of all the points of such a ray of light are in the same plane
 samtal dhruvit prakaash utpann karne ke anya upaay nimnlikhit hai : 1
 Diffusion occurs in crystals such as nickel prism - calcite, but the two mutually flat plane rays are so close that only one of them is difficult to obtain
 kintu kailcite ke visheshu yukti se kaate hue do prismon ko canada baalsam se jodakar ek samaantar falki prism bana liya jaataa he, jise nikal prism kehete hai
 Upon entering Canada, on reaching Balsam, a ray is completely reflected and goes to the lateral and is destroyed there, but the second ray goes straight out
 yah prism acha paardarshee hota he
 Thus, the flat, polar light obtained from it is the color of incident light
 2
 polaroid - isamen herapathite naamak khanij ke sookshm crystalon ko vishesh yukti se saloloid ke do takhton ke bich main is prakaar samaantar sthiti main jamaa diya jaataa he jisase ve sab milakar ek lambey chaude crystal kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 This produces flat polarized light, similar to tourmaline
 ise polaroid kehete hai
 Its very long wide planks can be made
 is rang halakaa haraa hota he
 In 1941, an even better device was devised, whereby the molecules of polyvinyl alcohol are deposited in a parallel state
 ise paularoid-ech kehete hai
 It has no color at all and 99
99 percent of the light is polarized
 3
 paravartan - san 1810 main malus ne pramanit kiya tha ki jal yaa kaach jaise kisi paardarshee padaarth ke prishth se paravartit prakaash main dhruvan kaa gun anshat: paaya jaataa he or aapatan kone vishesh maan kaa hone par vah purnat: samtal dhruvit ho jaataa he
 This incidence angle is called the "polar angle"
 brooster ke niyamanusaar yadi dhruvak kone i ho tathaa paravartak padaarth kaa vartanaank m ho to sp hota he
 4
 Filletganj - Although the reflected light at the polar angle is completely polarized by the fillet of the slab, the light transmitted from it is never fully polarized, it is only partially polarized, but the light transmitted from among several plaques progressively
 The polarization increases progressively and when the number of plaques becomes sufficient, it becomes almost completely flat
 patali patali kai patticoon ke aise samooh ko pattikapunj kehete hai
 5
 Scattering - When light falls on very small particles present in a transparent medium, then the light circulating around them is also normally fractionated
 kintu jo prakaash praathmik kiran se samakonik disha main prakirnit hota he, vah purnat: samtal dhruvit hota he
 This can be seen in the blue light of the sky, which is only the sunlight transmitted by the molecules of air
 jis prakaar yah maaloom karne ke liye ki koi prakaash samtal dhruvit he yaa nahin or yadi he to uskaa dhruvanatal koun-sa he, tourmaileen kaa upyog hota he, thik usee tarah dhruvan utpann karne ke uparyukt sabhi sadhano kaa upyog bhi is kaary ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The solution to produce this is that flat polarized light is injected onto a bipartite crystal, such as a mica plate, on a regular basis
 isse do bhinn ayaamon vaali samakonat: dhruvit kirane bhinn vegon se ek hi maarg par crystal main chalati hai
 On exiting from it, some time is generated in these two rays and by combining the two, ellipse polarized light is obtained
 yadi crystal pattica kii motaai itani ho ki kalantar 90 degree ho jaae to us pattica ko chaturthaansh tarangapattica kehete hai
 Rotating this fillet increases the amplitude of one beam and decreases the other
 jis sthiti main donon aayam baraabar ho jate hai, usamen pargamit prakaash vruttadhruvit ho jaataa he
 a quadrant wavelet is also used to identify such polarities
 yah ddeerghaavritiya athwa vrittiya companon kaa pun: do samakonik saral rekhaatmak companon main vighatan kar detaa he or pattica ko ghumaque yathochit sthiti main laane se vah unke kalantar ko gata yaa badhaakar 0 degree yaa 180 degree kar detaa he
 Therefore, the transmitted light becomes flat again polarized, which can be identified by tourmaline or nickel
 anshadhruvit athwa adhruvit prakaash se is kriya dwaara samtal dhruvit prakaash praapt nahin ho saktaa, kyonki anshadhruvit prakaash adhruvi tathaa samtal dhruvit prakaash kaa mishran hota he or adhruvit prakaash kaa tourmaileen dwaar lop kabhi bhi nahin ho saktaa
 Having knowledge of the direction of vibrations in plane polarized light, a polar plane was conceived and defined as: The polar plane is the import plane of a perfectly flat polar beam obtained by reflection
 at: tourmaileen kii jis sthiti main is paravartit kiran kii tivrata nasht ho jaati he usamen tourmaileen pattica par apaat tal se samaantar rekha khinch lee jaati he
 a parallel line is drawn from the emergency floor on the tourmaline plate and then the polar surface of any polarized light can be seen from such tourmaline
 ise jaanane ke liye saralatam yukti yah he ki kisi andhere kamare main samtal dhruvit prakaash kii patali kiran urdhwadhar disha main chalaai jaae
 The path of the ray will remain invisible, but if the smoke of very thin particles is generated near this ray by burning the paper, the path of the beam will be visible due to the light transmitted from those particles
 kintu chaaron ore ghumkar dekhne se kisi ek dishavishesh main kiran adrishy hi rahegi
 Apparently scattering does not occur in this direction
 at: yahi kampan kii disha he, kyonki kampan kii disha main anuprastha tarang nahin chal sakati
 By this measure it has been known that the direction of vibration is right-angled from the polar plane, ie the vibrations of the reflected beam at the polar angle are right-angled from the emergency plane
 yahi baat anya upayon se bhi pramanit ho gai he
 According to the electromagnetic theory of light, each beam has both electromagnetic and magnetic vibrations, and they are also parasitic
 is siddhant se yah bhi prakat hota he ki dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash main vaidyut kampan apattal se samakonik hote hai
 Therefore, it results that the vibrations of light affecting the eyes are electrical, not magnetic
 dhruvak kone par paravartit prakaash main companon ke apaat tal se samakonik hone kaa taatpary spashtat: yah he ki yadi apati kiran ke kampan apaat tal main hon, to uskaa paravartan dhruvak kone par bilkul hi nahin, hota
 Therefore, when the angle of incidence is equal to the polar angle, then the polar light in the emergency can be reflected, but the emergency cannot reflect the polar light at right angles
 jyotimaapan main is baat kii aavashyaktaa hoti he ki prakaash kii tivrata ko icchaanusaar ghataya ja sake or yah bhi ham yatharthatapurvak jaan saken ki is ghati purv tivrata main or purvavarti tivrata main kya anupaat he
 Two nickel prisms are used for this
 jab donon samaantar avasth main hote hai, tab to uttarottar donon main hokar nikalanevaale prakaash kii tivrata mahattam hoti hai, kintu yadi donon kii sthitiyon ke bich main kone ho to tivrata ke anupaat main ghat jaati he
 Polaroid can also be used for this purpose
 pamir nadi tajikistan or afghanistan kii ek nadi he
 It is a tributary of the Panj river
 yah tajikistan ke sudur purvi kohistoni-badakhshaan swashasit praant main pamir parvaton kii himanion main utpann hoti he
 Its main source is believed to be Zorkul Sarovar
 yahan se aage iske maarg ko afghanistan ke vaakhaan galiyare kii uttari sarhad or tajikistan or afghanistan kii antarrashtriya seemaa mana jaataa he
 It is merged with the Wakhan River near the villages of Afghanistan's Langar and qila-e-panj and after this confluence it is known as the Panj River

 Esperanto is an easy and artificial international language
 "doctoro asperanto" ke upnaam se is bhashaa ke nirmaataa ludwig laazar zamenhof ne asperanto kii pehali kitaab 1887 main warsaw main prakashit kii thi

 The script is pronounced as it is read
 alag-alag matra bhashaayen bolne waalon ke liye asperanto ek samuhik, yojit, saral bhashaa he
 Zamenhof's aim was to have a language that is easy to learn, politically neutral, transcending nationality, and a tool for peace and international communication between speakers of different provincial and national languages
 kaha jaataa he ki aaj duniya main 1 lakh se 20 lakh ke bich log asperanto bol sakate hai
 The largest number of speakers of this language are in Europe, East Asia and South America

 2) Equality: When you speak Esperanto, you feel like everyone else, because those you are speaking to have tried to learn Esperanto just like you
 3) tatasth: asperanto kisi ek jati yaa desh kii amaanat nahin he
 Therefore it functions as a neutral language
 4) saralata: asperanto is tarah taiyaar kii gayi he ki yah bhashaa siikhnaa baaki bhashaaon kii tulana main bahut aasaan he
 a comment on grammar: 5) jivant bhashaa: anya bhashaaon kii tarah hi asperanto kaa bhi vikaas hota aayaa he or is zabaan main hamaare sabhi vichaaron or jazabaaton ko vyakt kiya ja saktaa he

 The likelihood of spread from one person to another depends on a number of factors including the exit of infectious droplets by the carrier, the effectiveness of air circulation, the duration of the infectious stay, the severity of the M
 tuberculosis effect, the level of resistance in the uninfected person and others
 Is included

 He considered the interest of the state as paramount, not giving prominence to the principles of the religion of Islam in governance

 Ranthambore ruler Hammir Dev was famous for his ability and courage

 Hence, in July 1301 AD, Alauddin took the fortress of Ranthambore into his possession
 hammirdev veergati ko praapt hue
 Alauddin killed Ranmal and his companions, who met Hammirdev by betraying him
 ‘tarikh-e-alaai’ evam ‘hammir mahakavy’ main hammirdev or unke parivaar ke logon kaa johar dwaara mrityu praapt hone kaa varnan he

 The ruler of Mewar was Rana Ratan Singh, whose capital was Chittor

 yahan par bhagwaan kartikeya ko samarpit ek suvikhyath mandir he, jahaan prativarsh lagbhag 70 lakh bhakt darshan ke liye pahonchte hai
 The name Palani is derived from the combination of two Tamil words Palam and Ni, and the name originates from the legend of the main temple
 palani shabd kaa uccharan tamil akshar 'l ' ke nikatatam uccharan parimay kaa prayog karke kiya jaataa he, tathaa isliye angreji main ise "pazhani" bhi likhaa jaataa he
 This city is mentioned in the ancient Tamil devotional articles

 The proof of this is the magnificent temple of the beautiful Bhagwati Periyanayaki Amman in the city
 The two-fish conspiracy emblem of kings is present in many places in this temple, which makes it known that in the first century this territory was under the influence of the Pandyan kings of Madurai
