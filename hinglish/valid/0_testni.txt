 maanav ke pachan tantra main ek aahaar-naal or sahyogi granthiyaan hoti hai
 The alimentary canal is made up of the mouth, pharynx, pharynx, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus
 sahaayak pachan grathiyon main laar granthi, yakrut, pittashay or agnashay hai
 Special components of dietary substances are protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, mineral salts and water
 sabhi khaadya padaarth inhen ghatakon se bane rahete hai
 One has more components, some less
 hamaara sharir bhi inhen avyavon kaa bana hua he
 2 / 3 of the body is water
 protein sharir kii mukhya vastu he, jisase ang banate hai
 Carbohydrates remain in the body in the form of glucose, which the muscles always need
 vasa kii bhi atyadhik maatra sharir main ekatra rahati he
 Vitamins and salts are required for proper editing of body functions
 hamaara sharir ye sab vastuen aahaar se hi praapt karata he
 Yes, the chemical form of the ingredients from the diet is different from the body form
 atev aahaar ke avyavon ko sharir pachak rason dwaara unke sookshm ghatakon main vighatit kar detaa he or un ghatakon kaa phir se sanshleshan karke apane liye upyukt avyavon ko taiyaar kar letaa he
 This is done by organ cells
 jo ghatak upyogi nahin hote, unako ye chhod detii hai
 The body excretes such substances through feces, urine, sweat and breathing
 pachan kaa prayojan he aahaar ke gudh avyavon ko saadhaaran ghatakon main vibhakt kar dena
 This work is performed by lala rasa in the mouth, gastric juice in the stomach, pancreas juice and bile in the duodenum, and in the asteroid by the intestines
 in kaaryon kaa yahan sankshep main varnan kiya jaataa he : The food in the mouth is chewed by teeth and divided into microscopic particles and saliva gets mixed in it, in which there is an enzyme called tyline
 yah ras munh ke baahar sthit kapolgrathi or adhohanviny tathaa adhojihv grathiyon main banataa hai
 From these glands, especially by chewing their food, saliva juice keeps coming in the mouth
 isaki kriya kshareey hoti he
 The chemical action of its tyline enzyme is particularly on carbohydrates, which causes its starch to be converted first into dextrin and then to glucose
 saadhaaran eekh kii chini main bhi yahi parivartan hota he
 Wetting and snoring of the food grains are also the main function of Lala, so that it can be swallowed easily and the thin grass reaches the stomach through the placenta
 nigalane kii kriya mukh ke bheetar jihva kii peshiyon tathaa grasani kii peshiyon dwaara hoti he
 Due to the inhibition of the muscles of the tongue, the tongue lifts up and presses the grass placed on the palate and the tongue, which slips and goes from the pharynx backwards
 turant grasani kii peshiyaan sankoch karti hai or grass ghatidhakkan par hota hua grasanalee main chalaa jaataa he, jahaan uski bhittiyon main sthit vrittakar or anudairthay sutara apane sankoch or vistaar se utpann hui antragati dwaara usko naal ke ant tak pahunchaa dete hai
 And the grass enters the stomach through the gastritis
 amashay main pachan kii kriya jathraras dwaara hoti he
 The mucous glands of the stomach produce this juice
 jab aahaar amashay main pahunchataa he to yah ras chaaron ore kii grathiyon se amashay main aisi teevr gati se pravaahit hone lagata he jaise usko undela ja rahaa ho
 The two main components of this juice are enzymes called pepsin and hydrochloric acid
 pepsin kii vishesh kriya proteinon par hoti he, jisamen hydrochloric amla sahaayta karata he
 By this action, the protein first swells and then starts melting from outside
 is kaaran grass kaa bheetar kaa bhaag der se galata he
 This leads to the action of Lala's tiline enzyme until all the alkali of Lala is neutralized by the acidic acid of the stomach
 jathreey ras kii kriya dwaara protein se pehle metaprotein banataa he
 It then turns into a protozoase
 proteojez phir peptone main tut jate hai
 It does not change much
 jathreey ras main do or enzim bhi hote hai, jinako amiles or lypez kehete hai
 Amylase dissolves carbohydrates and lipase fats
 is main doodh ko faadanevaala ek or enzim renin bhi hota he
 It also has mild bactericidal power
 jathreey ras kaa srav mukhyatya tantrikamandal ke adheen he
 Experiments by the noted Russian scholar Pavloff of physiology have thrown much light in this regard
 unase pramanit ho chukaa he ki aahaar padaarthon kii sungadh naak se soonghane or unako netron se dekhne se ras kaa srav hone lagata he
 This is the reason that hunger begins to be known only by the smell of the making of good food items, and seeing them increases the apps
 jeebh par lagane se turant khaane kii ichha hoti he
 If the food items are not good or tasteful, then hunger dies
 aise aahaar kaa pachan bhi uttam reeti se nahin hota
 It also reduces the secretion of juice
 jathreey ras kii kriya visheshkar protein par hoti he
 The secretion of juice occurs when meat, eggs, fish, milk, etc
 reach the stomach
 namak, baraf yaa kankad aadi khaane ko die jaayen to srav nahin hoga
 These two big glands are very much related to digestion of pancreas and liver
 agnyashay main agnyashay ras banataa he
 It is a very strong digestive juice, which acts on all three components: protein, carbohydrate and fat
 iskaa nirmaan agnyashay granthi kii koshikaon dwaara hota he or saare agnyashay se ekatra hokar yah ras ek vahini dwaara grahani main pahunchataa he
 The duct that carries bile from the father's body becomes common bile duct with this pancreas
 usee ke mukh dwaara agnyashay or pitt, donon ras, grahani main pahonchte rahete hai
 The pancreatic gland is located behind the left stomach in the abdomen
 iskaa bada sir grahani ke mode main rahata he or uski punch bain ore pleeha tak chali gai he
 Its color is slightly beige brown
 iske sookshm bhaag shahatut ke daanon ke samaan uthe hue dikhaai padate hai
 Pancreas juice has strong action, especially on protein
 usase protein bina foole hue hi ghulne lagata he
 The action of this juice is alkaline
 is kaaran pehle kshareey metaprotein banati he
 Proteases are then formed from metaproteins
 proteos phir peptone main parivartit ho jate hai
 Finally, the breakdown of peptone creates amino acids, which are the end products of protein digestion
 amashay se proteinon ke pachan ke falswaroop jo peptone aate hai, ve bhi amino amlon main tut jate hai
 The nervous system has no control over the secretion of pancreas juice
 tantrikaon ke uttejan se ras kii utpatti kam yaa adhik nahin hoti
 The origin of the juice starts when the food digested in the stomach, which is of semi-fluid form, comes out of the stomach through the pyloric cavity and enters the duodenum
 is amlik kaainm ke sampark se grahani ko shleshmal str kii koshikaon main sicrratin naamak rasinic vastu utpann hoti he
 This item reaches the cells of the pancreas by blood and stimulates them to make juice and then the juice starts coming into the duodenum
 is ras kii duusari visheshta yah he ki yadi grahani main pahunchne se purv hi agnyashay kii nalika main is ras ko ekatra kar liya jaay, to vah niskriy rahata he
 There is no action on its protein
 jab vah grahani main aane par antric ras ke saath mil jaataa he, tabhi usamen protein vighatit karne kii prabal shakti utpann hoti he
 It is believed that an enzyme called enterokinase of intestinal juice activates it
 ye nimnlikhit hai : The upper part of the right side of the abdomen is the largest gland in the body called the liver, which produces bile
 vahaan se pitt pittashay main jaakar ekatra ho jaataa he or pachan ke samay ek vahini dwaara grahani main pahunchataa rahata he
 Can also reach the duodenum directly from the liver
 yah hare rang kaa gadha taral dravya hota he
 It helps in digestion of fat
 grahani se aahaar, jisamen uske paachit avyav hote hai, kshudantra ke pratham bhaag agrakshudrant main aa jaataa he
 At this time it is thick like honey and can flow well into the esophagus
 yahan bhi pachan kriya hoti rahati he
 Pancreatic digestion continues for some time
 kshudantra ke ras main bhi pachan shakti hoti he
 It can break down proteins, but not proteins, and peptones into amino acids
 par uski vishesh kriya depsin amoiles or lipej enzymon ko sakriy bananaa he
 Pavloff, who was the first to explore the subject, believes that all three enzymes remain in their former form before the intestinal juices were found, and are therefore inactive
 tripsin tripsinogen ke rup main rahati he
 Amylase and Lipez also live in the former state
 jab antraras agnyashayras main miltaa he, to tripsinogen se tripsin ban jaati he or shesh donon enzim bhi sakriy ho jate hai
 Pancreas juice is inactive before intestinal juice is added
 kshudantra kaa kaary visheshtya avasorana kaa he
 By looking at the picture of its internal composition, it will be known that in the mucous art inside it, which covers all the bowel from within, deep folds remain, which makes the art surface more than the bowel
 kala kii silavaton par ankur lage rahete hai
 All of these work to be absorbed
 ankuron kii sookshm rachana bhi dhyaan dene yogya he
 In the middle of each shoot, a whitetail has moved near its crest
 yah akshirvahini he
 Black lines appear on either side of it, which are the branches and cells of arteries and veins
 ye donon prakaar kii rachanaayen, vahiniyaan or dhamni tathaa shirayen, baahar yaa neeche jaakar adhoshleshmik str main badi raktavahikaaon or vahiniyon main mil jaati hai
 The fat is absorbed by the mucosa and then reaches the aneurysm and finally gets into the blood
 glucose or protein kaa avasorana hokar ve raktakeshikaon dwaara rakt main pahunch jate hai
 Blood carries these three components to the cells of each organ of the body and nourishes them
 20-22 foot lambii kshudantra kii nalee kaa yahi vishesh kaary he
 The function of the colon is absorption only
 yah ang visheshtya jal kaa avasorana karata he
 At the time of excretion, the form of excreta, which forms in the excreta, forms at the end of the colon and rectum
 24 ghante main brihadantra jal kaa avasorana kar letaa he
 Apart from water, it also absorbs some glucose, but does not absorb any other substance
 iske atirikt loh, magnesium, calosium aadi sharir kaa tyaag brihadantra hi main karte hai
 Here they are excreted and mixed in feces
 jeevanuon kii kriya se bhi pachan main sahaayta milti he
 In the gastrointestinal tract, they break down protein, fat and starch etc
 brihadantra main ve celulose kaa bhi, jisapar kisi pachak ras kii kriya nahin hoti, bhanjan kar daalate hai
 Due to this, gases like hydrogen sulfide, methane etc
 are produced and fat is formed from the breakdown of fat, due to which the action of feces becomes acidic
 yah gati saare pachak naal main, grasanal se lekar malashay tak, hoti rahati he, jisase khaaya hua yaa paachit aahaar nirantar agrasar hota jaataa he
 This motion occurs in other means and also in vessels
 antranal main shleshmal str ke baahar vrittakar or unke baahar anudairdhya peshisutron ke str sthit hai
 The width of the placenta is narrowed by the inhibition of circular formulas
 atev sankoch se aage ke aahaar kaa bhaag peeche ko nahin laut saktaa
 That is why longitudinal formulas shrink and reduce the length of that part of the placenta
 atev aahaar aage ko bad jaataa he
 Then he moves further with similar action in the front section
 yahi antragati kehalaati he
 The second Khandibhavan motion also occurs in the placenta wall
 ye gatiyaan aahaar ko aage badhaane main sahaayta dene ke atirikt, bhalee prakaar se kim ko math sa detii hai, jisase pachak ras or aahaar ke kanon kaa ghanishtha sampark ho jaataa he
 From the description of the action of different digestive juices, it is clear that nature has made such a arrangement that all the components of the dietary substances, which are present in the animal body also, do not go in vain
 unka jitna bhi adhik se adhik ho sake, sharir main upyog ho
 They can create broken parts of the body, also create new tissues and generate energy to work
 aahaar kaa yahi prayojan he or aahaar ke bhinn avyavon kaa unke atyant sookshm tatwon main vibhanjan kar dena, jisase unka avasorana ho jaay or sharir kii koshikaaye unase apni aavashyak vastuen taiyaar kar len, yahi pachan kaa prayojan he
 In fact, in what is commonly called digestion, the sense of two actions is hidden, digestion and absorption
 pachan keval aahaar ke avyavon kaa apane ghatakon main tut janaa he, jo pachak rason kii kriya kaa fal hota he
 Their absorption and reaching into the blood is the second activity, which is the special function of the acinar of the esophagus
 aahaar kaa jo kuch bhaag pachne tathaa avasorana ke pashchaat antra main batch jaataa he vahi mel hota he
 Therefore, there is also some indigestible part of the food in the stool and there are pieces of mucous art of the bowel
 inke atirikt jeevanuon kii bahut badi sankhya hoti he
 It has been calculated that each time 15,00,00,00,000 bacteria are released from the body in the feces
 ye brihadantra se hi aate hai
 He is the home of bacteria
 is kaaran mel main nitrogen kii bahut maatra hoti he, jisase uski uttam khaad banati he
 There is a reflex action of excretion, which is edited by the Atmag Department of the Tantric Circle
 jab malashay main mel ekatra ho jaataa he to niyat samay par malashay kii bhittiyon se merujju ke pashchimshwangon kii koshikaon main samveg jate hai, jahaan se ve purvashrangon kii koshikaon main bhej die jate hai
 From there, the new impulses reach the rectum by stimulating tantric sutras, expand the muscular muscles there and increase the intestinal instincts of the rectum
 isi samay hamako malatyag kii ichha hoti he or hamaare baithne par tathaa sanvarani peshiyon ke dhili ho jane par malatyag ho jaataa he
 Increasing the pressure inside the abdomen on the inhibition of the above muscles also helps a lot in bowel movement
 faadi madagascar dweep-desh kii samskruti main kai prakaar kii chizon par lagi varjana ko bolte hai
 People, places, verbs and things can be the subject of Fadi and they vary from place to place in Madagascar
 kai faadi malagasi samskruti main purvaj-puja se sambandhit hote hai or mana jaataa he ki inke ulanghan se alokik shaktiyaan aprasann ho sakati hai
 Fadi Malagasy are important in ethnic identity and are also considered beneficial for connecting the society
 malagasi bhashaa main "kripya" or "kshamaa karen" ke liye "azaafaadi" kehete hai, jiskaa arth he ki "main jo kar rahaa hoon yah mere liye faadi na ho"
 Some examples of Fadi are as follows and this work is strictly forbidden in all Malagasy culture - malagasi samaaj main sthaan va kaal ke anusaar naye faadi lagaataar banate gayi hai
 Before starting any new work or business, an offering called "zoro" is offered, which proves that the work will not be a violation
 faadi todane ko "ota faadi" kehete hai or yadi kisi se jane yaa anjaane main "ota faadi" ho jaye to use palit samajha jaataa he or "maloto" naam se sambodhit kar ke us se dur rahaa jaataa he
 The society looks at him with hatred and is held responsible for putting the society at risk
 madagascar main aaye paryatakon ko bhi faadi pratibandhon kaa sammaan karne kii salaah di jaati he

 The botanical name of the hemp plant is cannabis sativa
 yah bhaang kii jati kaa hi ek paudha he
 It does not look different from cannabis, but it does not flower like hemp
 kaenabis ke paudhon se ganja, charas or bhang, ye maadak or chikitsopayogi dravya tathaa fal, bijtel or hemp, ye udyogopayogi dravya, praapt kiye jate hai
 In the valley of Napal, Bengal, it rises from you with cannabis; But it is also cultivated somewhere
 isamen baahar phool nahin lagate, par beej padate hai
 Botanists believe that the cannabis plant has three distinctions - female, male and bisexual
 isaki kheti karanevaalon kaa yah bhi anubhav he ki yadi ganje ke paudhe ke paas yaa khet main bhang ke paudhe ho, to ganja acha nahin hota
 That is why farmers usually uproot cannabis and throw it out of the cannabis field
 kaenabis sativa moresii kul ke kanabwydi samudaay kaa paudha he
 It is native to Central Asia, but it is self-cultivated or cultivated in many regions of the temperate and tropical regions
 bharat main beej kii boai varsha ritu main kii jaati he
 The area of the hemp is usually acingal, monocular and mostly four to eight feet high
 iske cond sidhe or koneyukt, pattiyaan kartalakaar, teen se aath patrakon tak main vibhakt hoti hai
 The floral cymbals, male inflorescence long, hang down and the queen crescent are of short, epigraphic charges
 fal golai liye lattu ke aakaar kaa or beej jaisaa hota he
 Plants are smelly, mud-covered and slightly mucous due to resin secretion
 ganje ke paudhe se ek prakaar kaa lasa bhi nikalataa he
 Although this gluten does not come out in the lower countries, however, it grows in abundance on the Himalayas and this makes charas
 bharat main ganja khaaya nahin jaataa; log isamen tamaaku milakar ise chilam par pite hai; par angareji dawaaon main iskaa satt kaam main laayaa jaataa hai
 There are many species of hemp - sandstone, hill, flat, bullet, bhangra etc
 baaluuchar ke taiyaar hone par use katkar or pula banaakar pairon se raundte hai
 In this way, the top-placed Ganja is written in Vaidyaka as Kaduva, Kasaela, Tita and Trishan and is considered as Kafnashkat, Receptor, Digestive and Agni
 yah nashila or pittotpadak hota he
 Its fibers are strong and are used to make twine like flax

 Kiratarjuniyam is an epic poem written by Mahakavi Bharavi in the seventh century AD, which is ranked in the 'vrhatatrayi' of the epics in Sanskrit literature
 mahabharat main varnit kiratveshi shiv ke saath arjuna ke yuddh kii laghu katha ko aadhaar banaakar kavi ne raajnneeti, dharmaniti, kootneeti, samaajanneeti, yudhniti, janajivan aadi kaa manoram varnan kiya he
 This poem is filled with various juices, but it is predominantly a heroic work
 sanskrit ke chha: prasiddh mahakavy hai – brihattrayee or laghutrayee
 Kiratarajanayiyam, Shishupalavadham and Nashidhacharitam - are called Brihattrayi
 kumarasambhavam, raghuvansham or meghdutam - laghutrayee kehalaate hai
 Kiratarajuniyam is the only available work of Bharvi, which paved the way for a Sangopang epic
 magh-jaise kaviyon ne usee kaa anugaman karte hue sanskrit sahitya bhandar ko is vidha se samrudh kiya or ise nai oonchaai pradaan kii
 The stream of the epic, which appears in Kalidasa's miniatures and Ashwaghosh's Buddhacharitam, notwithstanding its distinct qualities, does not have the poise and totality that Bharvi initiated
 sanskrit main kiratarjunium kii kam se kam 37 tikaayen hui hai, jinamein mallinath kii tikaa ghantapath sarvshereshth he
 In 1912 Karl Kappler translated German into Kirtarajuniyam under the Harvard Oriental Series
 angreji main bhi iske bhinn-bhinn bhaagon ke chha: se adhik anuwaad ho chuke hai
 Due to Bharvi's special tendency in politics and behavior-policy, it was only reasonable that he would pick up the story of Kiratarajuniyam from the Mahabharata
 unhone vanaparv ke paanch adhyyon se pandavon ke vanvaas ke samay amogh astr ke liye arjuna dwaara kii gai shiv kii ghor tapasya ke falswaroop pashupathastra praapt karne ke chote-se prasang ko uthaakar use atharah sargon ke is mahakavy kaa rup de diya
 When Yudhishthira lost everything in the Dutekrida with the Kauravas, he had to go on a 13-year exile with his brothers and Draupadi
 unka adhikansh samay dwaitvan main beetaa
 Draupadi used to inspire Yudhishthira often to prepare for war and to withdraw his kingship from the Kauravas through war, dismayed by the hardships of exile and remembering the plot by the Kauravas
 bhim bhi draupadi kii baton kaa paksh lete hai
 a forester sent to Hastinapur as an undercover informs that Duryodhana is involved in the all-round development and consolidation of his united kingdom, as he feared the Pandavas for half the kingdom he had dealt with fraud and gaming
 pandavon ko bhi lagata he ki vanvaas kii avadhi samaapt hone par unka aadha rajya bina yuddh ke waapas nahin milegaa
 Draupadi and Bhima provoke Yudhishthira to immediately attack Duryodhana, not waiting for the period of exile to end, but unwilling to take the limits of idealistic, unforgiving Yudhishthira behavior
 udhar aa nikle vyas salaah dete hai ki bhavishya ke yuddh ke liye pandavon ko abhi se shakti-sanvardhan karnaa chahie
 According to the remedy given by him, Arjuna walks towards the Indrakil mountain in the Himalayas under the guidance of a Yaksha to appease Indra for asceticism
 vahaan ek ashram banaakar kii gai tapasya ke falswaroop apsaraon aadi ko bhejkar pariksha lene ke baad indra ek vruddh muni ke vesh main upasthit hote hai or tapasya ke nashwan loukik lakshya ko nidhsaar bataate hue parmarth kii mahatta kaa nidarshan karte hai
 Arjuna satisfies Indra by presenting the account of the deceit and injustice done by the Kauravas in its cut, the imperative of retaliation from the enemy, social duty and retaliation for injustice
 falswaroop indra apane vaastavik rup main prakat hokar arjuna ko manorath-purti ke liye shiv kii tapasya karne kii salaah dete hai
 Arjuna again engages in severe, uninterrupted penance
 arjuna indrakil ke liye ek ajanabi tapasvi he, jataa, valkal or mrigcharm to uske paas hai lekin saath hi sharir main kavach bhi he, yagyopavit kii jagah pratyancha-samet gandiv dhanush he, do vishaal tarkas hai or ek uttam khadg bhi
 Considering it to be anti-sageism, the other ascetics there are terrorized and reach Shankar for request
 uske kram main shiv ji kiraaton kii sthaneey janajati ke senapati kaa vesh dharankar kiraatveshdhari apane ganon kii sena lekar arjuna ke paas pahunch jate hai
 That is why a demon named 'mook' considers Arjuna's penance to be the work of the gods, holding the body of a giant sucker, and then hurries to kill him
 shiv or arjuna donon dwaara ek saath chalaae gaye ek-jaise baan se us boar kii igalila samaapt ho jaati he
 Shiva's arrow gets pierced into the earth piercing his body and when Arjun goes to remove his arrow from his body, Shiva sends one of his Ganes to raise a dispute
 parinamtah donon ke bich yuddh armbh ho jaataa he
 Arjuna forces the army of the Ganas to run away with arrows but is defeated in the war with Shiva
 paraajay se hataash arjuna kiraat-senapati ke vesh main shiv ko pahachaanakar samarpan kar dete hai, jisase prasann hokar shiv prakat hote hai or pashupathastra pradaankar uskaa prashikshan dete hai
 In this way, with the completion of Arjuna's intention, all the intentions of the epic genre are proved
 kiraat veshdhari shiv ke is lokottar myth se itar is prasang kii apni ek vishisht janajaatiy abhivyanjana bhi he, jo is kavy ko vartmaan bhavabodh ke kareeb laati he
 The unwavering loyalty, indomitable boldness and high political understanding of Vancher in the dialogue between Yudhishthira and gupta-turned-vancher leaves no room for doubt in India's favor towards the forest dwellers
 vanechar shuru main hi spasht kar detaa he— In the beginning of this whole episode, some proverbs have been uttered by Bhima towards Yudhishthira in support of Draupadi's talk
 unheen main se ek neeche uddhrit he: Bharavi is known for his sense of pride - 'upma Kalidasasya Bhaverirthagaurvam'
 is arth-gaurav se mail khaati ek vidagdh bhashaa or abhivyakti-kaushal unki smapda he
 He has an extraordinary penetration in diverse dimensions of life, including politics and behavior
 adarsh or vyavhaar ke dwandv tathaa yatharth jivan ke atirekon ke samaahaar se arjeet santulan unke lekhan ko ‘samastalokaranjak’ banaata he
 But Bharvi is basically a poet of life's irony and discrepancies, confronting him and trying to reconcile between his rough reality
 kiratarjunium ke pehle sarg main draupadi or duusare main bhim dwaara yudhisthir ko duryodhana ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke liye uksaane or yudhisthir dwaara use anithipurna bataakar asweekaar kar dene ke kram main bharavi ne raajnneeti ke do chhoron ke bich ke dwandv par bahut sarthak vimarsh prastut kiya he
 Similarly, in the eleventh canto in the place of salvation, Indra's asceticism for power and sovereignty has been described as indescribable by Indra, as a response to Arjuna, Bharavi retaliated against injustice in life-practice, cosmic success, fame and self
 - The serious views given on the importance of respect, they present a picture of a balanced ideal of a healthy academic life
 bhashaa par apane apratim adhikaar ke chalate chitrakavy ke jis bhashik chamatkaar kii parampara bharavi ne shuru kii, unke baad ke kaviyon ke liye vah kasuti ban gai or magh main jaakar vah charmotkarsh par pahaunchi
 See the pictogram in the following lines

 Destroyer or Destroyer - In maritime / naval language, destroyer ships are fast-moving warships
 inkaa avishkaar 20veen sadi ke praarambhik varshon main hua or tabhi se nausenayuddh main isak sthaan bejod rahaa he
 It has a unique place in the history of the Navy due to the successful carrying out of multifaceted and reliable tasks
 at: iskaa ateet, vartmaan or bhavishya adhyayan karne yogya he
 It is certain that the destroyer was invented by torpedoes
 tarpedo ne nausenayuddh main kranti laa di
 This was the first time a small ship equipped with a torpedo could take a front from a large navy and destroy it
 nausainik samartantr main is krantikari avishkaar se chote jahaajon kaa vikaas aavashyak ho gaya
 There were two reasons for this : in kaarnon se hi vinaashak kaa avishkaar hua
 In the early ruptures, called "torpedo nostrils", there were only two torpedo tubes
 shatru ke dhwanskon par akraman karne ke liye inpar aage kii ore ek top arudh hoti thi
 These ships were very small, with displacement of 200 to 300 tons
 samay bitne par dhwansak kaa prabhaav badhaane ke liye usapar adhikadhik tarpedo ladanaa aavashyak samajha gaya
 The number of torpedo tubes gradually increased, and by the time of World War II, eight nozzles on two mountings were humanized
 akramak asron main hawaii jahaaj kaa pravesh hote hi dekha gaya ki hawaii akramanon se bachaav ke liye dhwansak par havamar top kaa rahanaa aavashyak he
 Initially, the general machine gun was installed on the destroyer, but such small guns did not have destructiveness, so later amphibious guns were installed
 pandubbi kaa vikaas hone par vinaashak par ek kaam or aa padaa
 That was, finding and destroying submarines
 iske parinamswaroop dhwansak pandubbimaar astr bhi dhone lage
 This was bound to increase the size and extent of the destroyer
 pratham vishwayuddh ke purv jahaan vinaashak keval 300 din ton visthaapan ke hote the vahaan aaj 2,000 ton se adhik visthaapan ke vinaashak banane lage hai
 There have been many radical improvements in destroyers over the last few decades, but its basic features, such as high speed and maneuvers, have not differed
 tej gati ke abhaav main bade bade jahaajon par akraman karte samay vinaashkon ke batch nikalne kii sambhaavna kam rah jaati he
 Their amazing ability to be protected at sea is due to their streamlined shape and design
 dhwansak main jo astr-shastr rahete hai ve teen shreniyon main vibhakt kiye ja sakate hai : 1
 torpedoes to attack ships, 2
 pandubbi par akraman ke liye asr shasr, 3
 Amphibious cannons for fighting aircraft and small ground forces
 yon to vinaashak kaa nirmaan hi bade jahaajon par tarpedo se akraman karne ke liye hota he, tathaapi aadhunik nausenayuddh main tarpedo akraman ke avasar kam hone ke kaaran tarpedo kaa mahatv dhire-dhire ghat rahaa he
 But it cannot be said that the days of the torpedo attack are now over
 peechha karanevaale or lautanevaale tarpedo ke aagaman se jahaajwahit tarpedo ke din phir laut sakate hai
 According to some people, the submarine has developed so much that it cannot be destroyed by the destroyer
 yadhyapi kuch seemaa tak yah kathan satya he phir bhi nikat pareekshan se prakat hota he ki aaj bhi vinaashak pandubbi ko maarane main samarth he
 In the last World War, 300 submarines were submerged by the destroyers
 ab to sudurastha lakshvedhi astron or sudhari hui swananvesh yuktiyaan uplabdh hai, jinase vinaashkon kii shakyata bahut bad gai he
 Submarines torpedoes containing drone helicopters and rockets have greatly increased the ability to search and destroy submarines
 samudri jahaajon ke liye hawaii akramanon kaa sankat bad jane se uske nirakaranarth hawamaron kii shakyata badhanaa swabhaavik tha
 But even radar controlled and instant hit cannons cannot protect against aerial accidental aircraft
 top ke sthaan par niyantrit missile kaa prayog hone par, jaisaa ant main hoga, dhwansak pehle ke samaan hi prabal ho jaayenge
 The destroyers are the most trusted parts of the fleet
 pichley mahayuddh main dhwanskon ne sab prakaar kaa kaary kiya tha
 They hid the task forces, escorted the convoys, transported the initial survey teams, hid the waterfront ghats, rescued casualties in the war and dispensed postage
 saath hi lagbhag 300 pandubbiyon ko bhi dubaaya
 They ranged from warships located at the very bottom of the water to cruisers, destroyers and petrol vessels
 dhwanskon kaa bhavishya ujjwal maaloom hota he
 In future these carriers will be an essential part of Kritik Sen
 ye krithik sena ke parichayan paraas ko paryaapt badhaakar tathaa vaahak hawaii gashat kaa niyantran karke hawaii pratiraksha ko sudrudh karege
 Only the submarine can destroy the fast ships
 uttam pandubbimaar asron se las dhwansak khojane maarane kii karrwai main bejod honge
 The destroyer has proved to be a very useful ship even today in the maintenance work
 bhavi dhwansak kaise honge, isaki pariklpana hi kii ja sakati he, par aadhunik jhukaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah pariklpana bahut kuch yatharth hogi
 The future destructor will almost certainly operate with nuclear power, since nuclear power will be the only means by which the tolerance of the destructor can be increased
 bhavishya main dhwansak kii sahansheeltaa mahatv kaa kaary karegi, isamen koi andeh nahin, kyonki krithik sena ko hafton tak samudr main rahanaa pad saktaa he
 It will also be necessary to increase the speed of the destroyer
 bhavi dhwansak saralata se 50 note kii chaal se chal sakegaa
 It will be necessary to reduce the torpedo weapons
 par dhwansak main pandubbimaar tarpedo rah sakate hai
 These would have rockets, the active tips returning to the torpedoes, such that they could be filled with tubes by the string
 topon ko purnataya hataa dena padegaa or unke sthaan par tal-se-tal vaale niyantrit missile lage rahenge
 There will also be drone helicopters on the destroyers
 saranshat: naveenatam kism ke pandubbimaar astron, aadhuniktam kism kii khoj karanevaali yuktiyon or niyantrit missile kii badariyon se yukt dhwanskon kaa kaary bhavi yuddh main bahut hi mahatvapurn hoga

 Money cannot be taken for free software

 Although money can also be earned from free software, but its method is somewhat different, but there was such a stampede on the free software that the business class started shying away from adopting those other methods too

 There is a difference between the two, but the relationship is also deep
 free software se hi yah sab shuru hua he isaliye aise software ko Free Open Source Software yaa chote main FOSS kaha jaataa he
 Here the word free means freedom, but the word free also means without money, so the use of the word free puts you in some circles

 linus torwaldas, jo linaks ke janmdata hai, ne apni jeevani david dimond ke saath likhi he
 Its name is 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary'
 This is a very good book and reading it motivates us to move forward in life
 He says about open source software in this book, ‘the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest won’t be excluded from its development
 


 So open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It's still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people’s rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that doesn’t mandate legal protection for such secrecy
’ When we are talking about some benefits in open software, it would be very good to see some other side too
 Bill Gates is the father of Windows
 unhone ‘the Road Ahead’ pustak likhi he
 This book is also very good

 In this, they describe the shortcomings of free software in this way, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
' It is difficult to say which way the software industry will go but many countries and business houses of the world are making open source software their part

 Bagda Brahmin / BAGRA / BAGDA / BAGADA bagda brahmanon kii utpatti un 52 rishiyon se maani jaati he jinhe dilli ke raja ananjagpal ne kashipuri ke gangatat se bulaayaa tha
 The Brahmins who resided here were the Gaud Brahmins, descendants of Brahma's son, Sage Bhardwaj
 uplabdh jaankaree ke anusaar inke gautra bhi gaud brahmanon ke hi hai
 The Baghdas Brahmins originated from Jinhi
 isiliye kaha ja saktaa he ki bagdh brahman hi he jo baboor naamak sthaan par nivas karne ke kaaran 'bagaur brahman' kahalaaye
 Later, the word 'bagaur' then became popular as 'bagda'
 bharat kii rajdhani dilli main vikram samvat 1169 ko tanvar vansh ke antim raja rahe anangpal kaa rajtilak hua tha
 After some time, 'delhi' came in the dream of King Anagpal and asked him to leave
 raja ne apane sapane kii baat apane kul purohit jagadish rishi ko bataayi or apana rajya sthir rahe iske liye upaay poocha
 On this Jagdish Rishi spoke of calling Baghvishi and his 51 disciples of Kashipuri and keeping it in his kingdom
 raja ne apane khaas dewan ko bagav rishi ko unke kutumb va 51 shishyon sahit dilli padhaarney evam raja anangpal ke rajya ko sthir rakhane kaa upaay poochne ke liye kaha
 The special Diwan of the king reached Kashipuri Baghav Rishi and told him the whole thing and prayed to go to Delhi and stay
 raja ke khaas dewan kii prarthana par bagav rishi ne kaha ki 21 din akhand yajna hoga jisame 21 angul kii sarvadhatu kii keel prithvi main gadi rahegi tab tak raja kaa rajya achal rahegaa
 On the invitation and prayer of King Anagpal, Baghavishi along with his family and 51 disciples, Margashirsha Shukla Doj, left Vikram on Thursday, 1199 and reached Delhi after two months
 dilli nagar kii seemaa ke baahar raja anangpal va jagadish rishi ne unka swaagat kiya
 On reaching Delhi, Bagava Rishi and his 51 disciples started a yajna on Vaishakh Shukla Trayodashi, Thursday, Vikram Samvat 1200 and Jyeshtha Shukla three, on Wednesday, made a complete sacrifice and 21 Angul's Sarvadhatu keel yagya yagna
 bagav rishi nen raja ko kaha ki he rajan yah keel basik naag ke sheesh main gaadi gayi he
 Do not ever uproot it
 jab tak yah keel rahegi tera rajya bhi akhand rahegaa
 Then King Anagpal made Bagava Rishi and his disciples the second teacher of his dynasty
 bagav rishi ne raja se kaha ki he rajan ye keel basik naag ke sheesh main gadee gayi he ise kabhi bhi mat ukhdna
 As long as this nail remains, your kingdom will remain unbroken
 tab raja ananjagpal ne bagav rishi va unke shishyon ko apane vansh kaa dwitiya guru banaaya va 52 gaanv guru dakshina me diye
 Ashada Krishna, Navami, Tuesday, in Vikram Sambat 1200, Baghav Rishi and 51 of his disciples reached the area called 'bagour' and made it their place of residence
 iske pashchaat inhone vichaar kiya ki brahman ke shatkarmon main se daan lenaa or dena ye mukhya kaary hai to apane se daan lene vaale kul purohit to kaashi main hi rah gayi
 At that time there used to be Brahmabhat named Chokchand in Bagore area
 inkaa shashan katwalia upashasanic kataaria gautra bharadwaj tha jinhe apana kul purohit banaaya va lakh pasaav kaa daan diya
 On the other hand, Takshak Nag, the son of Basik Nag, decided to dislodge the train which was driving in the head of Basik Nag
 takshak naag brahman kaa rup dhaaran kar raja ananjagpal ke paas dilli pahunchaa
 The king paid obeisance to Takshaka Nag in the form of a brahman, Takshaka Nag took blessing on the king and bowed his white sheet
 raja ne sochaa ye koi pahunche huye rishi hai
 Then the Brahmin disguise Takshak Nag asked the reason for hitting the earth
 raja ne bataaya ki yahan 21 din kaa akhand yajna kiya gaya tha isiliye yah keel basik naag ke sheesh main gadee gayi he
 As long as this nail remains, our state will remain
 is par brahman rupi takshak naag ne kaha raja tum bhi achche pagal ho yah 21 angul kii keel basik naag ke sheesh main gadee, jab ki kuna, baavdi to isse adhik gahare khode jate hai usame to basik naag nahin nikalataa
 If this is true, then this nail should be uprooted, if it turns out to be full of blood then the truth is false
 jab brahman takshak naag ne raja ko yah pramaan diya to raja ko us par or adhik vishwaas ho gaya
 The 'destruction opposite black wisdom' king felt right about Takshak Nag in the form of a Brahmin and uprooted the nail, then 3 drops of blood fell and at the same time that Takshak Nag of the Brahmin disappeared
 tab raja ne keel waapas garhwa di evam baari pashchaatap kiya
 He called his total teacher Baghav Rishi and narrated the whole story
 tab rishi ne kaha ab tumhaara rajya nahin rah saktaa
 'the nail which is loose, frothless and uninteresting' is the truth, which is not the condition of Guru's words
 raja bagav rishi ke charnon main gir padey tab rishi nen kaha he rajan! ab pashchaatap karne se kya jo honi he so hokar rahati he
 On this, the king asked Bagava Rishi what to do next
 rishi ne kaha rajan aapane hamako 52 gaanv guru dakshina main diye hai aap un gaanvon main jaakar rajya karo ham kaasht karke khaayenge
 The day your dynasty will rule and our clan will be its master, then we will regain this Dakshina
 tab raja ne kaha maharaj aapke vansh kii pahchaan kya hogi, is par raja ke kul guru bagav rishi ne kaha ki aaj se hamaare vansh kaa naam 'bagdh brahman' hoga or ham na kisi ke guru banenge or naa hi kisi ko shishy banaayenge
 Since then the origin of the 'bagda Brahmin' caste is considered
 kalantar main bagaud shabd apbhransh hota rahaa evam aaj ise bagdh ke naam se janaa jaataa he bagav rishi ne raja ananjagpal ko dilli kaa rajya apni ladkee ke putr prithviraj ko dene kii baat kahi
 Then the first Guru of the king asked Bagava Rishi about the capital of the king
 jagadish rishi ki hardik ichha thi ki raja unke gaanv jaakar rahe
 Baghav Rishi knowing his mind and said to the king, Rajan! You go to Patan village and build the capital and we too will no longer live in Bagore village
 tab raja ananjagpal ne ajmer se prithviraj ko bulawaaya or miti baishakh shukla chaturdashi vikram sambat 1201 main uskaa rajtilak kiya evam raja ananjagpal swayan patan gaanv jaakar rahane lage
 The Bagaud Brahmins reigned in the village of Bagore 11 and 5 days and left the village on Mitti Jyeshtha Krishna Chaturdashi Vikram Samvat 1201

 Mostly it comes from Prithviraj Raso, the epic of the early Hindi / Apabhransh poet Chandavardai, but the makers have taken a lot of leeway to portray this love story
 yah mohak gaatha march 15, 2009 ko dukhad ant ke saath samaapt hua

 He was called the warrior king
 jab vah dilli ke singhaasana par aaroh kiya, usne yahan kila raai pithora banwaaya
 uskaa puraa jivan lagaataar saahas kaa shrunkhlaa, veerta, namr evam sahrudayatapurna vyavhaar or mahaan kaaryon kaa he
 He defeated Mahabali Bhimdev, the ruler of Gujarat, at just thirteen
 uske dushman, jaichand kii beti, sanyogita ke saath uski prem kahani bahut prasidd he
 On the day of his 'swayamvar', he fled with her
 usne apana samrajya ko badhaaya, is dauraan mohammad ghori ne 1191 main bharat par akraman kiya or tarin ke pehle yuddh main use haraa diya
 The following year, in 1192, the Ghori army returned to challenge Prathviraj in the Second Battle of Tarain
 Sultan Muhammad Shahab-ud-din Ghori grew up with a large force of 120,000 on the Indian side
 
 When he reached Lahore, he sent his envoy asking for the right to surrender to Prithviraj Chauhan, but Prithviraj Chauhan refused to comply
 prithviraj chouhan tab apane saathi rajput pramukhon ko muslim akraman ke khilaaf apane madad ke liye ek aupchaarik sahaayta kii maang rakhata he
 About 150 Rajput chiefs responded to his request
 prithviraj bhi ek badi sena ke saath aayaa tha, ek bada hissaa jisame bhartiya yuddh ke liye haathiyaan shaamil the or uske saath tarin main sultan mohammad shahab-ud-din ghori ko milane aage bada phir se haraane ke ummid ke saath, jahaan ek saal pehle usne apane virdohi ko buree tarah haraake ksht pahunchaaya tha, sultan muhammad ghori ne prithviraj ko ek antim chetavanee di kii vah muslim bane yaa haar jaye 
 prithviraj ne virodh main ek prastaav rakhaa ki mohammad yuddh viraam samajhe, use apane sena ke saath vaapasi qi anumati de
 Sultan Muhammad Shahab-ud-din Ghori decided to attack
 ghori ne apane sainikon ko paanch bhaagon main vibhaag kiya or rajput sainikon par din ke samay se pehle hamalaa kiya dhanurdhari ghudsavaaron qi tarangon ko hamalaa karne bheja rajput sainikon par, lekin vaapasi qi jaise rajput hathi vyuh aage bade
 Taking advantage of the Rajput tradition of not fighting after evening, he attacked and defeated the Rajput army
 What happens next is evident from the local folk music which is still prominent in Rajasthan
 kaha jaataa he ki prithviraj ko unke raaj kavi sah dost, chandabhaar ke saath afghanistan le jaaya ga tha
 In Ghori's court, Prithviraj and Chandbhar were brought into bondage
 prithviraj ko teerandaji kii kala dikhaane ke liye kaha gaya tha, jisamen vah uddeshy or dhwani sunakar bas nishaanaa laga saktaa he
 It is also called the word-arrow
 ghori ne use is kala ko dikhaane ko kaha
 khel ko khud ke liye dilachasp banane ke liye, usne apane aankhon ko garm lohe ke dhaatu se chhed karavaaya
 chandbar kehete he,"ek raja, bhale hi ek kaidi ho, ek raja se hi aadesh praapt kar saktaa he
 So it would be an honor if you "ordered him to shoot"
 Then he says some shloka or verse, some of those lines were, "four bamboo twenty-four yards, Angul Ashta proof, Tau sultan hai mat chuko chauhan
 "
 chaar bans matlab chaar bambu ke chadi, choubees gaj lagabag 24 gaj, angal asht pravaan matlab aat ungliyon jitani chaudaai
 yah sab ek saath har drushti se ghori kaa singhaasana par baithne kaa sthaan bataa detaa arthath chaar bans unch chadi,24 gaj duuri par or puri aat ungliyaan upar ghori baitha tha
 "go ahead o Chauhan and Uddesh don't miss"
 Prithviraj thus kills Ghori in his court and is clearly feasting on his death
 dilli ke singhaasana par baithne chouhan vansh ke antim shaasha, prithviraj chouhan, ajmer ke raja someshwar chouhan, ke bete ke rup main 1165 main paidaa hue
 vah ek atyant pratibhavan baccha tha or sainik kaushal sikhane main bahut tej tha
 He had the skill to hit the target only on the basis of voice

 Anangpal, after hearing about his mother's father, the ruler of Delhi, his bravery and courage, declared him the heir to the throne of Delhi

 jab vah dilli ke singhaasana par aaroh kiya, usne yahan kila raai pithora banaaya
 His whole life was a series of constant courage, valor, noble deeds and great deeds
 shaktishaalee bhimdev, gujarat kaa shaasha, ko usne maatr teraa varsh ke umr main haraaya
 Her love story with her enemy, Jaichand's daughter, Sanyogita, is very famous
 uske "swayamvar" ke din vah use lekar faraar hua
 He expanded his empire, during which Mohammad Ghori invaded India in 1191 and defeated it in the first battle of Tarain
 agle varsh, 1192 main, ghori sena prathviraj ko tarin ke dushaare yuddh main chunauti dene laut ai
sultan mohammad shahab-ud-din ghoribharat ke taraf ek badi bal sankhya 120,000 ke saath bada
 jab vahlahore pahunchaa, usne apane doot ko prithviraj chouhan kaa samarpan kaa adhikaar maangane bheja, lekin prithviraj chouhan ne use paalan karne se inkaar kiya
 Prithviraj Chauhan then asks his fellow Rajput chiefs for a formal assistance to help them against the Muslim invasion
 kareeb 150 rajput pramukhon ne uske anurodh main apni pratikriya vyakt qi
 Prithviraj also came with a large army, a large part of which included Indian armies and with the hope of defeating Sultan Muhammad Shahab-ud-din Ghori at the Tarain, again with great hope, where a year earlier he had defeated his adversary
 After being badly defeated, Sultan Muhammad Ghori gave a final warning to Prithviraj that he should become a Muslim or lose
 Prithviraj proposed a protest that Muhammad should consider a ceasefire, allowing him to return with his army
 sultan mohammad-shahab-ud-din ghorine hamalaa karne kaa nirnay liya
 Ghori divided his troops into five parts and attacked the Rajput soldiers before daybreak
 dhanurdhari ghudsavaaron qi tarangon ko hamalaa karne bheja rajput sainikon par, lekin vaapasi qi jaise rajput hathi vyuh aage bade
 Taking advantage of the Rajput tradition of not fighting after evening, he attacked and defeated the Rajput army
 iske baad kya hota he yah sthaneey loksangit se spasht he jo abhi bhi rajasthan main pramukh he
 It is said that Prithviraj was taken to Afghanistan along with his royal poet-friend, Chandbhar
 ghori ke adaalat main, prithviraj or chandbar ko bandhan main laayaa gaya tha
 Prithviraj was asked to show the art of archery, in which he could just aim at hearing the purpose and sound
 yah shabdabhedi-baan ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Ghori asked him to show this art
 To make the game interesting for himself, he pierces his eyes with a hot iron rod
 Chandbhar says, "A king, though a prisoner, can only receive orders from a king
 isliye yah ek sammaan hoga agar aap use "nishaanaa lagane kaa aadesh denge
 tab vah kuch chand yaa kavita kahata he, un panktiyon main se kuch the,"chaar bans choubees gaj, angal asht pravaan, maar maar mote to chook na chouhan"
 chaar bans kaa matlab he chaar baan kii chadi, choubees gaj lagabag 24 gaj, angal ast praval matlab aat ungliyon jitani chaudaai
 yah sab saath main ghori apane singhaasana par baithne kaa thik sthaan ko darshata he arthath chaar bans chadi kii oonchai,24 gaj kii duuri or thik aat ungali upar ghori baitha tha
 "go ahead, Chauhan and don't miss your objective"
 Prithviraj thus kills Ghori in his own court and apparently meets his own death
 rajput rajyon jesesaraswati, saamana, koharaam or haansi ko ghori ne bina kisi kathinaayee se kabza kiya tha or bina kisi chunauti ke vah ajmer ke ore bada
 haara hua prithviraj ko uski rajdhani tak peechha kiya jahaan use bandhi ke rup main, waapas afghanistan laayaa gaya
 Sultan muhammad-ghori spared Prithviraj Chauhan's son, Kola, who in turn swore loyalty to Ghori
 ghor main ek bandhi ke rup main, prithviraj ko zanjeeron main sultan mohammad ghori ke saamne laayaa gaya
 Ghori orders Prithviraj to bow down his eyes
 lekin prithviraj use inkaar karata he or kaha"sachcha rajput apni ankhen jhukaata he jab vah marataa he"
vah sunne ke baad ghori ghusse se aag babula hua or apni aadamiyon ko prithviraj ko laal garm lohe kii chadi se andha banane kii aadesh detaa he
 After some time Ghori arranges an archery competition
 tab chandra bardi jo ghori rajya main kavi ke rup main shaamil hua tha, use kahata he ki prithviraj ek namchi dhanurdhar he jo dhwani sunke apana nishaanaa laga saktaa he
 Ghori refused to accept that
 phir usne apane aadmi ko prithviraj ko pratiyogita main laane kii aadesh di
 But Chandra Baradi tells Ghori that he will hit the target when Ghori orders him
 kyon mere kehane par hi, ghori aashcharyachakit hua
 Then Chandra Bardi replied that he is a king, and he would take orders from a king, not from the members of his court
 yah uskaa ahankaar ko santusht karegaa
 Actually killing Ghoro was a strategy that Chand and Prithviraj had already contemplated
 or ghori ko maarane ke baad unhone ek duusare par prahaar karnaa bhi taiy tha
 After that Prithviraj Chauhan was brought into the competition area
 chaand pehle se hi vahaan tha or ghori ko maarane kaa adhik sahaayta dohe ke rup main diya jo sirf prithviraj samaj saktaa tha
 "four languages twenty-four yards angul hand proof, Sultan above is now mat chauhan"
 Just as Ghori ordered to target Prithviraj, he drew his command up to his ear and hit Ghori right in his neck
 Ghori died on the spot
 prithviraj ne cheekh kar kaha,"mai ne mere apmaan kaa badla liya he"
or tab chaand ne prithviraj par waar kiya or prithviraj ne chaand par waar kiya, is prakaar ve dushman dwaara phirase bandi nahin honge
 And the brave died dead
 As Sanyogita realizes that Prithviraj is dying, she too dies
 or ham sabhi, sabhi pyaare kalakaar khaas karke prithviraj or sanyogita ko yaad karte he

 The situation in the Terai was very difficult due to high rainfall and malaria: three survey officers died due to malaria while two were discharged due to poor health

 At that time, Kanchenjunga was considered to be the highest peak in the world and he noted that there is a peak about 230 km behind it
 jon armastrang, jo vaug ke sah adhikari thea ne bhi ek jagah se dur pashchim main is chotii ko dekha jise unhone naam diya chotii ‘bi’
 Waugh later wrote that the observation indicates that the peak 'B' was higher than the Kanchenjunga, but the observation was from far away, it is necessary to observe closely for verification
 aane vaale saal main vaug ne ek survey adhikari ko tarai main chotii ‘bi’ ko nazdik se avlokan karne ke liye bheja par badalon ne saare prayaas ko roak diya
 In 1849, Waugh ceded the area to James Nicholson
 nicholson ne 190 kimi dur jirol se do avlokan taiyaar kiye
 Nicholson then brought a large conglomerate with him and headed east, with Nicholson from five different locations receiving more than 30 observations from 174 km to the nearest peak
 apane avlokanon par aadhaarit kuch hisaab-kitaab karne ke liye nicholson waapas patna, ganga nadi ke paas gaya
 Its rough calculation in Patna gave the average height of peak 'B' at 9,200 m मी, but it is not considered light refraction, which makes the elevation false
 sankhya saaf darshaya gaya, yadhyapi vah chotii ‘bi’ kanchanajangha se unchaa tha
 Although Nicholson suffered from malaria and was forced to return home, the accounts could not be finished
 maikel henacy, vaug kaa ek sahaayak roman sankhya ke aadhaar par chotiyon ko nirdisht karnaa shuru kar diya, usne kanchanajangha ko IX naam diya or choti ‘bi’ ko XV naam diya
 In May 1852, the center of the survey was brought to Dehradun, an Indian mathematician Radhanath Sikdar and a surveyor from Bengal named the world's highest peak for the first time using a trigonometric calculation based on Nicholson's Everest after a former chief
 , Repeated accounts were done to verify and its official statement, that XV is the tallest, was delayed for many years
 vaug ne nicholas ke data par san 1854 main kaam shuru kar diya or hisaab-kitaab, prakaash apvartan ke len-dein, vaayu-daab, avlokan ke vishaal duuri ke taapmaana par apane karmchaariyon ke saath lagbhag do saal kaam kiya
 In March 1856, through a letter, he completely announced his discovery to his representative in Calcutta
 kanchanajangha kii oonchaai saaf taur par 28,156 feet bataaya gaya, jabaki XV ki oonchaai bataai gai
 Vogue concluded about XV that "it is more probable that it is the tallest in the world"
