 Many such rural settlements number in the thousands
 isi tarah kisi gaanv ke vishisht darje ko dekhte hue uske saath jaagir shabd laga diya jaataa tha
 This means that from the annual revenue collection, the part of that village will not go into the government treasury or it will get partial exemption

 But to distinguish it from other villages of the same name, the newly created vassals used to add jagirs to them like Hinautia and Hinautia Jagir
 uttar bharat, pakistan or afghanistan main kai aise gaanv, shahar or mohalle hai jo ek jagah shuru hue or phir falkar unke do hisse ho gaye - ek mukhya yaa bada hissaa or ek chota hissaa
 In this case, "kalan" came to be called behind the name of the big part and "khurd" behind the small part

 Fiqh is called Islamic theology
 fiqh musalamaanon ke liye islamic jivan ke har pahalu par apana asar rakhata he
 While the Shari'a calls that set of policy
 jo islamic kanoonee, paramparaon or islamic vyaktigat or naitik aacharnon par aadhaarit hoti he
 Fiqh is the terminology for Islamic jurisprudence, which is made up of the judgments of Islamic jurists
 islamic adhyayan kaa buniyadi ghatak, fiqh us paddati ko vistaar se batalaata he jiske jariye se islamic kanoon ko praathmik or madhyamik sroton se baahar nikaala gaya he
 The history of Islamic jurisprudence is "divided into eight periods by custom"
 mahatvata ke kram main fiqh ke strot hai: The Qur'an gives clear instructions on many issues such as how to perform purification rituals before compulsory daily prayers, but on other issues, some Muslims believe that the Qur'an alone is not enough to make things clear
 udhaaharan ke liye, koran ke anusaar— ramadan ke maheene ke dauraan, dainik prarthanaayen or upwas main sanlagn hone kii zarurat he lekin musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki in kartavyon kaa paalan karne ke tareeke ke bare main unhen or hidaayat kii aavashyaktaa he
 Explanations of these issues can be found in the traditions of Prophet Muhammad, so in most cases the arguments are the basis of the Quran and Sunnah
 islam ke praarambhik kaal main kuch vishay bina misaal ke hai un maamalon main, musalmaan nyayavid anya tareekon se nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Sunni jurists exercise the historical consensus of the community; In the modern era, most jurists also use analogy and comparison of the profit and loss of new subjects
 in atirikt upkarnon kii sahaayta se nishkarsh aane par sharia ke hisaab se kanoonon kii ek vyapak sarani banati he or ise fiqh kaha jaataa he
 Thus, in the face of the Shari'ah, Fiqh is not considered sacred, and there are disproportionate views on other aspects of the 'schools of thought process' without looking at them as sacred
 adhik vistrut muddon main vyakhya ke yah vibhaajan vichaar-prakriya ke vibhinn skulon main parinamswaroop mila he islamic nyaayashastra kii yah vyapak avadharana vibhinn vishyon main kai kanoonon kaa strot he jo rosemara kii jindagi main musalamaanon ko nirdeshit karata he
 The study of jurisprudence is called Fiqh or Fiqh by making the foundation of Shari'a policy
 fiqh ke maamle main islamic vidwaanon kii alag alag vyakhyaaon ke kaaran islam main nyaayashastra kai bhaagon main bat gaya or kai alag alag nyaayashastra se sambandhit vichaardhaaron kaa janm hua
 These are called religions
 sunni islam main pramukh mazahab hai: Most Muslims believe that all four religions are fundamentally correct, and the differences are in the nuanced interpretations of jurisprudence

 shastr kaa prayog akraman karne, bachaav karne athwa daraane-dhamkaane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Weapons can be as simple as sticks, on the other hand as complicated as ballistic missiles

 Thus all the instruments from arrows, swords to big guns are armaments
 aayudh ke vikaas kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitna maanav jati ke vikaas kaa
 Human life has been struggling from time to time

 Along with the development and increasing power of armaments, devices of immunity were needed and invented
 sambhavat: charm ko lakdi ke dandon main phasaakar dhaal banane kii kala bahut puraani hogi
 Over the years, armor and in the modern era, armor was invented
 yah dekha gaya he ki manushya ne jab-jab sanhaar ke sadhano kaa nirmaan kiya, uske saath-saath pratiraksha ke sadhano kaa bhi vikaas hua
 Ordnances are generally classified based on their use, method and characteristics

 udaahranarth sharir ke liye charm tathaa kavach kaa, sir ke liye shiristraan or gale ke liye kanthatran ityadi kaa
 Similar weapons were also manufactured in Europe

 As long as the sphere moves in the placenta of the device, it keeps pressing on it and its velocity keeps increasing
 is prakaar usamen bahut adhik veg utpann ho jaataa he
 Due to the placenta, its direction is also determined; Therefore, by moving the placenta, the sphere can be hit at the target at will

 In India, Babur first used cannons in the battle of Panipat
 pehle topein kaanse kii banati thim or unako dhaala jaataa tha
 But such guns were not sufficiently athletic
 unamem adhik barood daalane se ve fat jaati thim
 To overcome this flaw, iron rings were heated and put on them very tightly

 1898 i
 main fransavaalon ne ek aisi top banaai jo uske baad bananevaali topon kii pathpradarshak hui
 The velocity of the projectile was higher than that; His attribution was commendable; The firing was completely stable, because in the implantation there were grains which did not allow the cannon to move in any direction by getting stuck in the ground
 sabhi topein daagne par peeche hatati hai
 Fluids were used to reduce the velocity of this attack
 iske prakshipt patali diwaar ke banaae the
 Each of these weights was about 12 pounds and contained about three and a half pounds of high explosive ammo
 prakshipt main vishesh rasayanon se yukt ek topi bhi rahati thi, jisase lakshya par pahunchakar prakshipt fat jaataa tha or tukade bade veg se idhar-udhar shatru ko dur tak ghayal karte the

 shaikshik praudyogiki uchit takneekee prakriyaaon or sansadhano ke srijan, upyog tathaa prabandhan ke dwaara adhigam or kaary pradarshan sudhaar ke adhyayan or naitik abhyaas ko kehete hai
 Instructional theory and learning theory are often associated with and included with the term educational technology
 jabaki anudeshi praudyogiki main adhigam evam anudesh kii prakriyaayein tathaa pranaliyaan shaamil hai, shaikshik praudyogiki main maanviya kshamtaaon ke vikaas hetu prayukt anya pranaliyaan shaamil hoti hai
 Educational technology incorporates, but does not include, software, hardware and Internet applications and activities
 lekin in shabdon ke arth ko lekar ab bhi bahes hoti he
 Educational technology can be most simply and easily defined as an array of tools that can be helpful in the learning process of the learner
 Educational technology relies on a broad definition of the term "technology"
 praudyogiki, maanav upyog kii bhautik samagriyon jaise mashiinon yaa hardware ke rup main sanderbhit kii ja sakati he, lekin isamen pranaliyaan, sanghatham kii vidhiyaan tathaa takanic jaise vyapak vishay bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 Some modern equipment is included but is not limited to only overhead projectors, laptops, computers, and calculators
 "smartphone" or game jaise nae upkaran gambhirtha se apni abhigyaan kshamta kii vajah se kaaphi dhyaan aakarshith karne lage hai
 Those who use educational technology for conceptual discovery and communication are either learners or teachers
 maanviya kaary-pradarshan praudyogiki hastpustika par vichaar karen
 Technology means "applied science" for the disciplinary areas, academic and human performance technology
 " duusare shabdon main, vaigyanik paddati ke upyog ke dwaara moulik shodh se vyutpann koi bhi prakriya yaa prakriyaayein praudyogiki maani ja sakati hai
 Educational or human performance technology may be based purely on algorithmic or experiential processes, but neither of the two necessarily implies physical technology
 praudyogiki shabd unani shabd “techne” se bana he jiskaa arth he shilp yaa kala
 ek anya shabd "takanic" bhi usee mul se aayaa he, jiskaa upyog shaikshik praudyogiki par vichaar karte samay kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore educational technology can be expanded to include teacher techniques
 1956 kii bloom kii pustak, texonomi of ajukational ovujactivj shaikshik manovigyaan ke paath kaa ek uttam udhaaharan he
 Bloom's taxonomies, when designing learning activities, can be useful to keep in mind what the learning goals of the learners are and what is expected of them
 baharhaal, bloom kaa kaary spasht rup se swatah hi shaikshik praudyogiki se sambhddha nahin hota or shaikshanik ranneetiyon se adhik sambandhit he
 According to some, an educational technologist is one who transforms basic academic and psychological research into evidence-based applied science for learning or instruction
 shaikshik praudyogvigyon ke paas praayah shaikshik manovigyaan, shaikshik media, prayogtmak manovigyaan, sangyanatmak manovigyaan yaa adhik vishuddh rup main, shaikshik, anudeshaatmak yaa maanviya kaary-pradarshan praudyogiki yaa anudeshaatmak abhiklpana ke kshetron main snaatak oopaadhi hoti he
 But some of the theorists listed below always used the term "educational technologist" to describe themselves, preferring a term like "teacher"
 shaikshik praudyogiki ke ek kutir udyog se ek vyavsaay main roopantaran ke bare main shuraville, brown tathaa whitaker ne charchaa kii he
 The emergence of educational technology can be found in its path as very early instruments in paintings on the walls of caves

 Advocating a proficient approach to learning based on the classification of his intellectual practices, Bloom supported instructional techniques that changed both instruction and timing as needed by the learner
 1970 ke dashak se 1990 ke dashak tak in diginon par aadhaarit model aam taur par computer aadhaarit prashikshan ), computer sahaytayukta anudesh yaa computer kii sahaayta se anudesh kehalaate the
 In a more simplified form, they were like today's "e-content" which is often the main part of "e-set up", sometimes referred to as web-based training or e-instruction

 Multiple choice questions are added continuously with immediate feedback for self-evaluation and guidance
 aisi i-saamagree iemes, adiel / scorm or iiqui dwaara paribhaashit maanakon par bharosa karti he
 The decades of the 1980s and 1990s gave a wide variety of institutions that could be placed under the umbrella of a label computer-based education
 aksar rachnawadi or sangyaanavaadee adhigam siddhanton par aadhaarit, in pariveshon ne amoort evam prakshetra-vishisht samasya samaadhaan shikshan par jor diya

 Computer-based training or computer-based learning, both of these earlier types emphasized student and computer practice and training on the one hand and student and micro-world and simulation on the other

 It also provides tools for student and course management
 adhigam praudyogikiyaan kaksha sanvardhan ke alaava, purnakalik duurastha shikshan main bhi pramukh bhoomika nibhaati hai
 While most quality offerings rely on paper, video and occasional CBT / CBL content, the use of e-learning has increased through forums, instant messaging, video conferencing and more

 The emergence of multiple mobile and ubiquitous technologies in the 2000s gave a new impetus to spatial learning, adapted to learning-for-reference scenarios
 kuch sahitya skool evam pramanik vyavastha donon ko ekikrut karne vaale mishrit adhigam paridrishyon kaa varnan karne ke liye ekikrut adhigam avadharana kaa upyog karte hai
 Three main theoretical schools or philosophical frameworks have been present in the educational technology literature
 ye hai vyavahaarwad, sangyaanavaad or rachnawad, teenon vaicharik skulon main se prayek aaj ke sahitya main upasthit he, lekin inkaa vikaas usee prakaar hua he jis prakaar manevigyaan sahitya kaa hua he
 Evolution of this theoretical structure Ivan Pavlov, Edward Thorndike, Edward C
 Tolman, Clark L
 Hull, B
C
 F
 Skinner and many others date back to the 20th century with animal learning experiments
 kai manovaigyanikon ne in siddhanton kaa maanav adhigam ke saath varnan or prayog karne ke liye istemaal kiya
 While it is still very useful, this learning philosophy has lost the support of many teachers

 ogaden lindsle ne bhi isi prakaar vyavhaar vishleshan par aadhaarit seleration adhigam pranali viksit kii thi lekin vah keller or skinner ke model se bilkul alag thi
 Cognitive science has changed teachers' attitudes towards learning
 1960 or 1970 ke dashak main sangyanatmak kranti kii shuruyaat ke bahut prarambh se adhigam siddhant main kaaphi parivartan aayaa he
 The empirical framework of behaviorism was mostly retained even though a new paradigm had been introduced
 sangyanatmak siddhant mastishk aadhaarit adhigam ko samajhane ke liye vyavhaar se pare dekhte hai
 Cognitionists consider how human memory works to promote learning
 sangyanatmak manovigyaan main atkinson-shifrine ke smriti model tathaa badele ke kaaryakari smriti model jaise smriti siddhant ke saidhantik dhaanche ke rup main sthapit ho jane ke baad, 1970, 1980, 1990 ke dashakon main adhigam kaa nayaa sangyanatmak dhaancha ubharne laga tha
 It is important to note that computer science and information technology have had a major impact on the theory of cognitive science
 computer science ke kshetra main anusandhan or praudyogiki dwaara kaaryakari smriti or deergh avadhi smriti kii sangyanatmak avadharanaon ko sugam bana diya gaya
 Another major influence on the field of cognitive science is that of Noam Chomsky
 aaj shodhakarta sangyanatmak bhaar tathaa soochna sansaadhan siddhant jaise vishyon par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai
 Constructivism is a learning principle or educational philosophy that many teachers started considering in the 1990s
 is darshan ke praathmik siddhanton main se ek he ki shikshaarthi nai jaankaree se apane swayan ke arthon kii rachana karte hai, jab ve vaastaviktaa yaa bhinn drushtikon vaale anya logon ke saath parsparik kriya karte hai
 a constructive learning environment requires that students use their prior knowledge and experiences to develop new, relevant and / or adaptive learning concepts
 Under this framework, the teacher's role becomes that of a guiding facilitator, so that the learners can construct their own knowledge
 Constructive teachers should make sure that prior learning experiences are appropriate and related to the concepts being taught
 jonasen kaa suzav he "acchhee tarah se sanrachit" adhigam vaataavaran nausikhia shikshaarthiyon ke liye upyogi hota he or "biimaar sanrachit" vaataavaran keval adhik unnat shikshaarthiyon ke liye upyogi hote hai
 Teachers using technology, while teaching from a constructivist perspective, should choose technology that reinforces prior knowledge in problem solving environments
 sangyojanavaad "digital yug ke liye ek adhigam siddhant" he, jise jorge cemens tathaa steven downess dwaara apane vyavahaarwad, sangyaanavaad tathaa rachnawad ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par, yah samajhane ke liye ki ham kaise jite hai, ham kaise samvaad karte hai or ham kaise sikhte hai, is par praudyogiki kaa kya prabhaav hua tha, viksit kiya gaya tha
 Executive Editor of the International Journal of Teaching Technology and Distance Education, Donald G
 Perrin states that the theory "combines the relevant elements of multiple learning theories, social structure and technology to compose a powerful theoretical concept for learning in the digital age" 
 " Problem-based learning and inquiry-based learning are active learning educational technologies that are used to facilitate learning
 vah praudyogiki jisamen bhautik evam prakriya prayukt vigyaan shaamil hai, ko is pariyojna, samasya, poochtacha-aadhaarit adhigam ke saath sammilit kiya ja saktaa he kyonki in sab main ek samaan shaikshik darshan he
 All three are student-centered, ideally these include real-world scenarios in which students are actively involved in critical thinking activities
 vah prakriya ek praudyogiki maani jaati he, jise apnaane ke liye chaatr protsaahit hote hai
 Bloom's taxonomies and instructional design are excellent examples of technology used by teachers and educational technologies

 Some of the claimed benefits are listed below: haalanki kaksha main praudyogiki ke kai laabh he, vahaan spasht kamiyaan bhi hai
 Lack of proper training, limited access to a sufficient amount of technology and the need for additional time for multiple implementations of technology are some of the reasons why technology is often not used extensively in the classroom
 ek nayaa kaary yaa vyapaar seekhney ke samaan, kaksha praudyogiki kaa prabhavi ekikaran sunishchit karne ke liye vishesh prashikshan mahatvapurn he
 Since technology is not the ultimate goal of education, but a means by which it can be achieved, teachers should have a better grasp of the technology used and its benefits than more traditional methods
 yadi in donon main kshetron main se kisi ek main bhi kami he, to praudyogiki shikshan ke lakshyon ke liye ek laabh na ho kar baadha ke rup main dekhi jaaegi
 Another difficulty is introduced when access to a sufficient amount of a resource is limited
 yah aksar dekha gaya he ki computer kii maatra yaa kaksha ke upyog ke liye digital camaron kii sankhya ek puri kaksha kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hoti he
 In some less informed forms, there is also limited access to technology research due to high cost of technology and fear of degradation

 Technology implementation may also take time
 kuch praudyogikiyon ke prayog main ek praarambhik seoup yaa prashikshan samay laagat nihit ho sakati he
 Even after the completion of these tasks, in the event of a failure of the technology during the activity, the teachers must have an alternative lesson ready as a result

 Whenever the technology platform changes, new resources are to be designed and distributed

 Only 15 of its species are found outside Australia and only 9 species are not found in Australia
 Eucalyptus species are grown throughout the tropical and subtropical region, including the Americas, Europe, Africa, the Mediterranean basin, the middle-east, China, and the Indian subcontinent
 nilgiri teen sajaateey prajatiyon main se ek he, jinhen aamtaur par "yucalipts" kaha jaataa he, anya hai korimbia or angophora 
 inamen se kuch, lekin sabhi nahin, gond ke ped ke rup main bhi jane jate hai, kyonki bahut sari prajatiyon main chaal ke kahin se chhil jane par ye prachur maatra main raal nikaalte hai
 Its species name derives from the Greek word ευ, meaning "good" and καλυπτος, meaning "covered", which is the upper layer of the outer caudal that initially covered the flower
 nilgiri ne vaishvik vikaas shodhakartaaon or paryaavarnavidon kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 It is a fast growing wood source, its oil is used for cleaning and as a natural pesticide and sometimes it is used to drain marshes and reduce the risk of malaria

 a mature eucalyptus may take the form of a low-height shrub or a very large tree
 isaki prajatiyon ko teen pramukh prakritik vaas or chaar aakaar shreniyon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Generalized as a "forest tree", it is single-stemmed and its peak is in small proportion to the height of the entire tree
 "vanasthali vriksh" ekal tanevaale hote hai, haalanki bhu-str se upar kuch duuri par isaki shakhaaen bhi ho sakati hai
 "malli" are multi-stemmed from the ground level, usually less than 10 m॰ in height, often at the end of the shoots, with their heads predominantly and the plant alone may be an amalgam of an open or closed structure
 kai malli ped itane chote ho sakate hai ki unhen jhaadi kaha ja saktaa he
 Two other tree types are notable in Western Australia, and they are described by the native name "mallet" and "merlock"
 "mallet" ek chote se madhyam aakaar kaa ped he jo lignotubar paidaa nahin karata he or jiskaa tana apekshaakrit lanbaa hota he, jisaki daaliyaan neeche kii ore jhuki hoto hai or praayah iskaa simavarti sheersh suspasht rup se ghanaa hota he

 mallet kii chikani chaal main aksar ek satin jaisi chikani chamak hoti he or jo safed, makkhni, dhoosar yaa tambai ho sakati he
 The word Merlok is used variously; In the Forest Tree of Australia, it is described as a small tree without a lignotuber, with a shorter trunk, with shorter branches than the mallet

 The leaves of the mature Eucalyptus tree are usually spear-shaped, leaf-stalk-like and distinctly alternate and waxy and flaky green
 iske ulat, ankurit beej ke pattey aksar iske vipareet, danthal rahit or halke nile rang ke hote hai
 But there are many exceptions to this model

 komal or paripakv pattiyon ke charan kaa nirupan kshetra kii pahchaan main mahatvapurn he
 The development of eucalyptus tree is identified in four stages of leaves: 'germination', 'tarunic', 'intermediate' and 'mature' stage
 However there is no fixed transitional point between phases
 madhyavarti charan, praayah jab pattiyaan sabase badi hoti hai, tarunik or paripakv charan ke bich kii kadi hoti he
 In all except a few species, leaves are formed in pairs on opposite sides of a square stem, consecutive pairs in right angles

 The easily recognizable features of Eucalyptus species are the distinctive flowers and fruits
 phulon ke asankhya roendaar punkesar hote hai jo safed, makkhni, pile yaa gulabi ho sakate hai; kali main, punkesar operculam naamak ek bahya aavaran se dhanke hote hai, yah aavaran sepalon yaa pankhudiyon yaa donon se bana hota he
 Thus flowers do not have petals, but they decorate themselves with many showy stamens

 The word Eucalyptus is made up of Greek words; eu-, meaning safe or well and kaluptos, meaning cover; Oparikulam means "safe cover"
 The wood fruits or capsules are roughly cone-shaped and have valves at the end of which the seeds are pulled out
 vayask pattiyon ke aane shuru hone se pehle adhikansh prajatiyon main phool nahin khilte;nilgiri sineria or nilgiri perriniana iske ullekhneey apwaad hai
