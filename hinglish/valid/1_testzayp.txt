nathuram godse ne avaidh shaastra rakhane kaa aparaadh nyaayalay main sweekaar bhi kiya tha
 In the same refugee camp he drew a portrait of himself and sent the picture with two letters to his colleague Narayan Apte in Pune
 30 janvari 1948 ko nathuram godse dilli ke birla bhawan main prarthana-sabha ke samay se 40 minute pehle pahunch gayi
 As soon as Gandhi entered the premises for the prayer meeting, Nathuram first bowed with folded hands and then without any delay, shot three bullets with his pistol and ended Gandhi
 godse ne uske baad bhaagane kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Nathuram Godse was tried in the Punjab High Court for the murder of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi
 iske atirikt un par 17 anya abhiyog bhi chalaaye gayi
 But according to the historians, the people in power were equally responsible for killing Gandhiji, as did Nathuram Godse or his other companions
 is drushti se yadi vichaar kiya jaye to madanlaal paahwa ko is baat ke liye puraskrit kiya janaa chaiye tha naa ki dandit kyonki usne to hatya-kand se das din purv usee sthaan par bam phodkar sarkaar ko sachet kiya tha ki gandhi, jinhen bady shraddha se sabhi log baapu kehete the, ab surakshit nahin; unhen koi bhi prarthana sabha main jaakar shoot kar saktaa he
 Nathuram was first produced in the Punjab High Court for the trial
 ek varsh se adhik chale mukaddame ke baad 8 navambar 1949 ko use mrityudand pradaan kiya gaya
 Although the arguments of exchange were offered by Gandhiji's sons, Manilal Gandhi and Ramdas Gandhi, those arguments were turned down by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Maharajyapal Chakraborty Rajagopalachari and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel
 nathuram godse ko sah-abhiyukt narayan apte ke saath 15 navambar 1949 ko punjab kii ambala jail main phaansi de diya gaya
 The time of day, or sometimes just the day, is the time period in some place of the earth during which the sun's direct or reflected light is illuminated at that place
 isi tarah kisi bhi taare kii parikrama kar rahe anya grahon par sthit jagahon bhi din kaa samay vah samay hota he jab ve us sthaneey taare kii chamak se roshan hon
 The time of day runs from sunrise until sunset and at any moment the time of day is running on about half of the earth
 prithvi ke ghurnan ke kaaran, dhruviya kshetron ko chhodkar, sabhi jagahon par din kii roshni or raat ke andhere kaa silsilaa dainik rup se chalata rahata he
 Darshan has been a very ancient tradition in Hinduism
 vaidic darshanon main shaddarshan adhik prasiddh or pracheen hai
 Conspiracy is more famous in Vedic philosophies
 ye sankhya, yoga, nyaay, vaisheshik, mimasaa or veydant ke naam se vidit he
 Their pioneers were Kapil, Patanjali, Gautam, Kanad, Jaimini and Badarayan
 isa ke janm ke aasapaas in darshanon kaa udai mana jaataa he
 Their early signs are also found in the Upanishads
 prayek darshan kaa aadhargranth ek darshanasutra he
 "sutra" is a wonderful style of Indian philosophy
 gine-chune shabdon main siddhant ke saar kaa sanket sutron main rahata he
 Being brief, a detailed commentary and several commentaries were written on the sutras
 bhartiya darshan kii yah style swatantra darshanagranthon kii pashchimi style se bhinn he
 The basis of education and creation of philosophy in accordance with Guru-disciple-tradition is its basis
 yah parampara shaddarshanon ke baad naveen darshanon ke udai main baadhak rahi
 Due to some novelty and differences in the context of interpretations, strains have arisen in the main philosophies
 pramanvichaar, sristimimasaa or mokshasadhana shaddarshanon ke saamaanya vishay hai
 These six philosophies consider the soul in some form or the other
 aatma kii prapti hi moksh he
 They also consider rebirth, ethics, yoga etc
 nyaay, yoga aadi kuch darshan ishwar main vishwaas karte hai
 Sankhya and Mimamsa Darshan are observationalists
 pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan or shabd ye chaar pramaan saamanyat: sabhi darshanon ko maanya hai
 Economics and non-availability are two more proofs in the Mimamsa school
 upanishnmoolak hone ke kaaran inamen vedantadarshan sabase adhik pracheen he
 But other views in the Brahmasutra are denied and his oldest commentary is that of Adi Shankara
 anya darshan sutron ke bhashya isa kii aarambhik shatabdiyon main rache gaye
 Sankhyasutra possibly disappeared
 ishwarkrishna kii "sankhyakarika" sankhya darshan kaa pramanik granth he
 Sankhya philosophy is insurrectional dualism
 iske anusaar prakruti or purush do swatantra or sanathan sattayen hai
 "nature" is the root and the subtle cause of the world
 vah satv, rajas or tamas in teen gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam prakruti he
 The canto begins with a man's contact with nature
 sarg purush kaa bandhan he
 Metaphysics leads to salvation
 apane shuddh chetan kartrutv bhoktrutv rahit swaroop ke gyaan se purush mukt hota he
 The principles of Yoga philosophy are similar to Sankhya
 yogasutra par rachit bhashya or tikaayen yogadarshan kii vistrut parampara kaa aadhaar hai
 The main goal of Yogadarshan is to pave the way to samadhi
 samadhi main chitt kii samast vrittiyon kaa nirodh ho jaataa he
 Practice, quietness and meditation are the main tools of yoga
 ishwar ko bhi dhyaan kaa lakshya banaaya ja saktaa he itnaa hi yogadarshan main ishwar kaa mahatv he
 Ashtanga Yoga, with eight parts of Yama, Niyam, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharna, Dhyana and Samadhi, is a universal path of yoga
 nyaay or vaisheshik pramanpradhan darshan hai
 Justice is a type of Indian logic
 nyayasutra par anek prasiddh tikaayen hai
 Ganges Upadhyaya's "tattvachantamani" started the tradition of Navya Nyaya in Navadvip
 nyaayadarshan ke pehle hi sutara main 16 padaarthon kaa ullekh he
 Through them, there is philosophy, which is the means of liberation or Shreyas
 pramaanon ko vishesh vistaar nyaayadarshan main miltaa he
 Godliness has been considered the tool of salvation in justice
 vaisheshik darshan ek prakaar se nyaay kaa samaan tantra he
 Special or 'nuclear' is its main subject
 parmaanu sristi kaa mul upadan kaaran he
 God is considered to be the reason for the creation of justice-vaishika-darshan
 vaisheshik darshan main sampurna satta ko saat padaarthon main vibhajit kiya gaya he - dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh, samavaay or abhaav
 This division became more valid later on being more relevant than the 16 substances of justice and formed the basis of the joint tradition of nyaya-vaisesika-philosophy which "nyamuktavali" etc
 are represented by the ancient texts
 shaddarshanon main antim do darshanon ko "mimasaa" kaha jaataa he
 These are known as Purvimansa and Uttaraimamsa
 anya darshanon kii apeksha inkaa vedon se adhik ghanishtha sambandh he
 In a way, these are interpretations of Vedic philosophy
 purvamimasaa, mantrasamhita or brahmanon ke karmkand kii vyakhya he
 Uttarmimamsa is the logical explanation of the spiritual philosophy of the Upanishads
 vedon kaa antim bhaag hone ke kaaran upanishdon ko "vedant" kehete hai
 The name of North Mimamsa is also "vedanta"
 in donon mimasaaon ke siddhanton kaa aadhaar vedon main he, kintu vyavasthit darshanon ke rup main inkaa aarambh anya darshanon ke saath saath hi hua
 That is why they are counted in the conspiracies
 donon mimasaaon ke itihaas ke teen charan hai
 They developed in the same northeast in all three phases
 vaidic yug main vedon ke purvabhag main karmkand kaa vidhaan hua
 Spirituality gained prominence in the northern part of the Vedas
 isa kii aarambhik shatabdi main jaimini or baadaraayan ke "mimasaasutra" tathaa "brahmasutra" bhi sambhavat: isi kram main rache gaye
 In the seventh century CE, Kumaril Bhatt and Shankaracharya promoted and propagated the East and the North in the same sequence
 anaatmavaadi hone ke kaaran buddhadarshan kaa aatmavaadi vaidic darshan se virodh he
 Buddhism emerged in the sixth century BCE in the form of revolution against Vedic religion
 anek kaarnon se isa kii chhathi shatabdi main buddha dharm kaa hraas hone laga
 At the same time, Kumaril and Shankaracharya revered both sides of the Vedic religion
 inke baad parthasarathi mishra tathaa madhavcharya ne purvamimasaa darshan kaa vistaar kiya
 Madhvacharya was a minister of King Vukka of Vijayanagar
 baad main sanyas lekar vidyaarany ke naam se shrungery peeth ke shankaracharya pad par asin hue or "panchadshi" naamak praddhi vedant granth kii rachana kii
 Among the four benches that Shankaracharya established on all the four corners of the country for the prestige of Vedantmat, Shringeri Peeth is situated on the Nilgiri Mountains in the south
 anya teen peeth puri, badarikashram or dwarka main hai
 Shankaracharya composed the languages on Upanishads, Brahmasutra and Gita
 shankaracharya ke baad vachaspati mishra, shri harsh aadi aacharyon ne vedant parampara kaa vistaar kiya
 The main goal of Purvimamsa is to arrange Vedic rituals
 iske anusaar vedamantron kaa mukhya arth vidhi athwa karm ke aadesh main he
 Mantras which do not have a judicial verb are "economism" and seek gods etc
 yadi yagyadi karm se ek divya shakti utpann hoti he jise "apurv" kehete hai
 This is the regulator of uncommon karma
 purvamimasaa main ishwar maanya nahin he
 The Vedas are eternal and apaurusheya
 nity shabd kaa kalp kalp main yathapurv sphot hota he or apurv kii shakti se yathapurv sristi kii utpatti hoti he
 The soul of Purvimamsa is as consciousnessless as Vaiseshika
 nyaay darshan ke char pramaanon ke atirikt arthapatti or anuplabdhi do pramaan or mimasaa darshan main maane jate hai
 Answer: Mimamsa depends on the northern part of the Vedas
 upanishad vedon ke antim bhaag hai, at: ve 'vedant' kehalaate hai
 The more famous name of North Mimamsa is "vedanta"
 brahmasutra or upanishdon kii vyakhyaaon ke dwaara vedant kaa vistaar hua he
 Many Acharyas have explained Brahmasutras and Upanishads from different perspectives
 aacharyon ke vibhinn maton ke aadhaar par vedant ke anek sampradaay ban gaye
 They are famous by the name of Advaita, Vividhavaita, Dvaita etc
 vedant ke ye sampradaay sankhya aadi kii bhanti darshanik nahin hai; in sabhi sampradaayon ke dharmik peeth desh ke vibhinn sthanon main pratishthit hai
 The Acharya tradition of these Peeths is intact till date
 gitadarshan bhi vaidic shaddarshanon ke samakaleen he
 The Gita's Karmayoga is an important fundamental philosophy after the Upanishads' Brahmanism
 sabhi vaidic darshanon ne karmyog kaa mahatv sweekaar kiya he
 Being practical, it can be called representative Indian biography
 gita ke karmyog main aadhyatm or jivan kaa adbhud samanvay hua he
 Historically, it is a syncretism of the Vedic rituals and Brahmanism of the Upanishads
 aadhyatm or karm kaa yah samanvay atyant mahatvapurn he
 The influence of Vedanta of the Upanishads and asceticism of Buddhism and Jainism were so increasing in the Indian public that the effect of seclusion and retirement would have become fatal to the society
 aisi sthiti main gita ne karmyog kaa sandesh dekar desh ko ek sanjivan mantra pradaan kiya
 Gita gave a new definition to sannyas by accepting spirituality
 "sanyas" kaa saamaanya arth "tyaag" he
 But there is often confusion in this sacrifice
 bhojan, shayan aadi prakritik karmon kaa tyaag kiya ja saktaa he
 It is also possible to renounce working deeds
 yahi gita kaa sanyas he
 It is possible to renounce the desire for fruit
 yahi gita kaa sanyas he
 Desiring to bear fruit, performing lustful deeds for public gathering is the ideal of life
 yahi moksh kaa saadhan he
 This Nishkam Karmayoga of the Gita has been adopted by most Indian philosophies
 gyanayog uskaa aadhyatmik aadhaar he or bhaktiyog uskaa bhavatmak darshan he
 Shankaracharya's Advaitamat is the oldest of these many sects of Vedanta
 yah sambhavat: sabase adhik pratishthit bhi he
 The monotheism of Shankaracharya depends on the Upanishads
 unke anusaar brahm hi ek maatr satya he
 The world deflects and enlivens the spirit of the living being
 agyaan kaa nivaaran hone par jeev ko apane brahmbhav kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is salvation
 brahm sachchidanand he
 Brahma's power and consciousness and his bliss are endless
 jaagrit, swapn or sushupt kii avasthaaon se pare tathaa bahya or aantarik vishyon se ateet anubhav main brahm kaa prakaash hota he
 Brahma is indescribable due to being transcendental
 sankhyathit hone ke kaaran use "advait" kaha jaataa he
 This monotheism is differentiated in practices of renunciation and love
 samadhi main iskaa aantarik saakshaatkaar hota he
 Brahma has been considered as the cause of the world to prove the advaita bhava
 brahm ko jagat kaa upadan kaaran maanakar donon kaa advait siddh ho jaataa he
 The apprehension of the outcome of the factor has been overcome by discourse
 vivartkaaran avikarya hota he
 Its function is false, like the snake's illusion in the rope
 rajju sarp or swapn praatibhasik satya hai
 The world is the practical truth
 moksh paryant vah maanya he
 Brahma is the ultimate truth which remains in salvation
 maaya se yukt brahm "ishwar" kehalaata he
 He is the creator of the universe, but it is not the ultimate truth
 brahmanubhav kaa saadhan gyaan he
 Acts are not eternal
 "brahm" karm ke dwaara saadhy nahin he
 Karma and devotion are the cooperative causes of salvation
 shravan, manan or nididhyasana mokshasadhana ke teen charan hai
 In salvation, the soul is freed from all shackles and is overwhelmed with eternal bliss
 yah moksh jeevankaal main prapya he tathaa jivan ke vyavhaar se isaki purna sangati he
 About 300 years after Shankaracharya, in the 11th century, Ramanujacharya established the Vishishtadvaita school based on the new interpretation of the Brahmasutras
 ramanujakrit "shribhashya" ke aadhaar par yah 'srisampradaay' kehalaata he
 Ramanuja does not believe in Shankar's Mayanism
 unke anusaar jeev, jagat or brahm teenon parmaarthik satya hai
 Jagat is not the inversion of Brahma but is the actual creation of Brahma
 brahm or ishwar ek duusare ke paryaay hai
 Jiva is part of Brahman
 moksh main jagat kaa vilay nahin hota or jeev kaa swatantra astitv bana rahata he
 Brahma is not unique and non-virtuous, but characteristic and virtuous
 brahm hi swatantra satta he
 Jeeva and Jagat are adjective adjectives
 brahm se pruthak unka astitv sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, Ramanuja's opinion is also Advaita
 jeev or jagat ke visheshnon se yukt brahm kaa inke sath vishisht advaitabhaav he
 Brahma is his inter-lord
 ramanuj ke mat main bhakthi moksh kaa mukhya saadhan he
 Knowledge of the qualities of God is the motivator of devotion
 saadhaaran jan or shudron ke liye prapatti arthath sharnagati sarvottam maarg hai
 a few years after Ramanuja, Nimbarkacharya established Dvaitadvaitaism in the 11th century itself
 brahmasutron par "vedant-parijaat-saurabh" naam se unka bhashya is mat kaa aadhaar he
 Like Ramanuja, Nimbark also considers Jiva and Jagat as truth and dependent of Brahma
 ramanuj ke mat main advait pradhan he
 The request for duality is greater in the Nimbark vote
 ramanuj ke anusaar jeev or brahm main swarupagat samya he, unki shakti main bhed hai
 There is a characteristic distinction between them in the opinion of Nimbark
 nimbark ke advait kaa aadhaar jeev kii brahm par nirbharta he
 The Brahm of Nimbark is a virtuous god
 krishna ke rup main uski bhakthi hi moksh kaa param maarg he
 This devotion comes from the grace of God
 bhakthi se bhagwaan kaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 This is salvation
 ramanuj or nimbark dono ke mat main videh mukti hi maanya he
 After Nimbarka, in the 13th century Madhvacharya propounded the dualism
 ve purnaprajna tathaa aanandathirth ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He has established dualism by refuting the Advaita of Shankaracharya and the dualism of Nimbarka
 unke anusaar bhed or abhed donon kii ekatra sthati sambhav nahin he
 Shankaracharya's Mayaism is also not acceptable to him
 jagat mithyaa nahin yatharth he
 It is not possible for the third indefinite category of Maya to be different from Sat and Asat
 ishwar, jeev or jagat teenon ek duusare se bhinn hai
 There are five types of distinction
 ishwarjiv, ishwar-jagat, jeev-jagat, jeev-jeev or jad padaarthon main paraspar bhed he
 God is the cause of the world, not the cause of the world
 upadan karan prakruti he
 God is its regulator
 ishwar kii bhakthi ke dwaara moksh praapt hota he
 There is a difference between free organisms
 ve ishwar se bhinn rahakar apni samathrya ke anusaar ishwar kii vibhuti main bhaag lete hai
 In the 15th century Vallabhacharya propagated the Shuddhadvaita faith
 is mat kaa aadhaar "brahmasutron" par likhit vallabhacharya kaa "anubhashya" he
 He considers the Advaita bhava of pure Brahma indulged with Maya
 yah brahm nirgun nahin, sagun he tathaa maaya ke sambandh se rahit he
 Brahma expresses as a universe with its infinite power
 chit or anand kaa tirodhan hone ke kaaran jagat main keval sat rup se brahm kii abhivyakti hoti he
 Jeeva and Brahma are one in nature
 agni ke sfurligon kii bhaanti jeev brahm kaa ansh he, visheshan nahin
 Thus everywhere is advaita, nowhere is dvaita
 maryaada or pushti do prakaar kii bhakthi moksh kaa saadhan hai
 In the 16th century, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu introduced Achintya piercing
 unke shishy rup goswami ne gaudi vaishnav sampradaay kaa pratishthapan kiya
 According to them, the power of God is untouchable
 vah virdohi gunon kaa samanvay kar sakati he
 The practice of salvation is the religion of life, not contemplating impunity
 moksh kaa arth bhagwaan kii priti kaa nirantar anubhav he
 Thus in the later period of the Vedic era, the new rise of Vedanta in the Upanishads took place in the form of Advaita, Vishayadvaita, Dvaita, Shuddhavaita etc
 from 7th century to 16th century
 upanishdon kaa vedant pashchimi or uttari bharat kii dein he
 Advaita etc
 cults emerged from the south
 inke pravartak dakshin deshon ke nivasee the
 Chaitanya's idea originated from Bengal
 kintu in sabhi sampradaayon ne vrudanvan aadi uttari sthanon main apane peeth banaae
 Shankaracharya installed benches at all four corners of the country
 uttar, dakshin, purv, pashchim sabhi pradeshon ke log in sampradaayon main sammilit hue
 Despite being different in principle, these various sects of Vedanta became the sources of internal unity of India
 pashupat dekhen In addition to Vedic and non-vedic philosophies, a third stream in the Indian philosophical tradition has flowed to Shaivism and Shakta sects
 kuch rahasyamay sadhana ke rup main hone ke kaaran yah vaidic or avaidic dhaaraon ke sangam main kuch saraswati ke samaan gupt rahi he
 But Shiva also has a lot of recognition as a direct worship
 pracheen aitihaasik khojon se shiv kii pracheenta pramanit hoti he
 The village has Shiva temples in the village
 prati saptaah or prati paksh main shiv kaa vrath hota he
 The divine marriage of Mahadev Parvati is worshiped as an ideal in Indian families
 rugveda or yajurveda ke rudra ke rup main shiv kaa varnan he
 But Shiva is often considered as the non-vedic god
 daksh ke yajyagwans ke prasang ke dwaara shiv kii avaidikata kaa samarthan kiya jaataa he puranic yug main bhi tridevon kii tulana ke prasang main virodh ke abhas milte hai
 But later Shiva became a very popular deity
 shaiva sampradaay praaia: gupt tantron ke rup main rahe hai
 Very little of his literature is published
 prakashit sahitya bhi pratikatmak hone ke kaaran duruh he
 There are many sects of Shaivite tradition
 inamen shaiva, pashupat, virshaiv, kalamukh, kapalik, kashmir shaiva mat tathaa dakshini mat adhik prasiddh hai
 These can be called conspiracies of Shaivite tradition
 shaiva siddhaat kaa prachaar dakshin main tamil desh main he
 Its basis is in the Agam texts
 14veen shatabdi main nilkanth ne "brahmasutron" par shaivabhashya kii rachana kar vedant parampara ke saath shivamat kaa samanvay kiya
 Pashupat Mat is famous as 'nakulish Pashupat'
 pashupat sutara is sampradaay kaa mul granth he
 The Kalamukh and Kapalic sects have been somewhat fierce and mysterious
 kashmir shaiva mat advait vedant ke samaan he
 Despite being a tantric, his philosophical literature is immense
 isaki spand or pratybhigna do shakhaayen hai
 One has the basis of Vasantagupta's vibrancy and the other is based on his disciple Somananda's "pratibhagyastika"
 jeev or parameshwar kaa advait donon shakhaon main maanya he
 Parameshwara "shiva" is similar to Vedanta's Brahman
 virshaiv mat dakshin deshon se prachlit he
 His followers wear Shivling
 at: inhen "lingayat" bhi kehete hai
 In the 12th century Vasava propagated this view
 virshaiv mat ek prakaar kaa vishishtadvait he
 It can be called Shakti Vishishtvaita because of considering Shakti specific world as the ultimate element
 uttar or dakshin main prachlit shaiva sampradaay bhi uttar vedant sampradaayon kii bhanti bharat kii dharmik ekta ke sutara hai
 Shiva worshiped from Kailas to Rameshwaram is the Mars god of Indian unity
 donon kii yatraaon ke dwaara bhartiya ekta kaa vyaavhaarik anushthan hota he
 The source of Shaktipuja is probably in the Matritantra of ancient India
 bhartiya pariwaron main devi kii mahima bahut he
 The word "devi" is often used in the women's names as an answer
 shakti ke anek rup hai
 Goddess is worshiped in the form of Lakshmi, Saraswati, Parvati, Kali etc
 "shakti" icchaaroop he
 In Sivasutra, willpower is given the form of Uma Kumari
 par tatv ke chinmay rup main ichhashakti kaa samanvay shakti darshan kaa ek mahatvapurn paksh he
 Reference error: Tags exist for the reference group named "N", but no tag was found for the group
 yah bhi sambhav he ki koi samaapti tag gaayab he

 yah or adhik manyata praapt thi ki olympic khelon ke ek yuva sanskaran olympic khelon main paalkon ko badhaava dene main madad karegaa
 Despite these reasons for the young people to be an Olympic event, the ioc's reaction to being a purely sporting event was negative
 iosi pratinidhiyon ne yah kaarykram khel ke bare main jitna zyada saanskrithik shiksha or vinimay ke rup main karnaa chaahate the, yahi vajah he ki samskruti or shiksha kaarykram ko khelon ke prayek utsav ke ek ghatak ke rup main viksit kiya gaya

 sambhavit host shaharon ko ek hi shahar ke bheetar sabhi ghatnaon ko rakhane ke liye aavashyak he or koi nayaa sports placement nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 Exceptions to this building moratorium include media centers, arena facilities for classrooms and workshops, and a village for coaches and athletes

 johans nicholas bronsted or martin lorie dwaara di gai aadhunik paribhaasha ke anusaar, amla vah rasinic yogic he jo pratikaarak yogic ko hydrogen aayan pradaan karata he
 For example, acetic acid and sulfuric acid
 Acids, solids, liquids or gases can be found in any physical state
 ve shuddh rup main yaa ghol ke rup main rah sakate hai
 The substance or compound in which the properties of acids are found are called
 maanav antra main hydrochloric amla kii adhikta se hone vaali beemaari ko amlata yaa acidity kehete hai
 Acids are substances that are sour in taste when dissolved in water, turn a roly made from turmeric to yellow, and their aqueous solution turns blue litmus paper red
 adhikansh dhaatuon par abhikriya karke hydrogen gas utpann karte hai, or ksharak ko udasin kar dete hai
 Fatty bases are those substances whose solution looks smooth, tastes bitter, turns turmeric red and neutralizes acids
 udasin karne kaa arth he aise padaarth kaa bananaa jisamen na amla ke gun hote hai, na ksharak ke
 While studying the properties of oxygen, Lavazi observed that when the elements like carbon, sulfur and phosphorus are burned in oxygen, the oxides made from them form acids with water
 ve is parinaam par pahunche ki amlon main oxygen rahata he or amlon kii amleeyta kaa kaaran oxygen he
 For this reason, this gas was named "oxygen", which means "acidifier" and for this reason, in the German language, Oxygen is called "sire stuff"
 lavaazie ne hi amlon ko do virgon, acarbonic amalon or carbonic amlon main vibhakt kiya tha
 It was seen that oxides of some elements dissolve in water to form not alkalis but alkalis and some acids do not contain oxygen at all
 bertile ne san 1787 main hydrosienic amla, davy ne san 1810-11 main hydrochloric amla or san 1813 main hydrodic amla kaa avishkaar kiya
 There is no oxygen in any of them
 aage chalakar dekha gaya he ki jo padaarth bilkul sookhe hote hai, unamem koi amleey abhikriya nahin hoti
 Then people divided the acids into two classes, one hydro-acid and the other oxy-acid
 peeche san 1815 main davy ne suzav rakhaa ki amlon kii amleeyta oxygen ke kaaran nahin, varan hydrogen ke kaaran he
 Dulang studied oxalic acid in 1815 and came to the conclusion that there is no difference between oxygenated and non-oxygenated acids
 amlon main koi aisa gun nahin he jise ham amlon kaa vishisht lakshan kah saken
 Common properties have been stated above
 amla or dhaatu kii abhikriya main amla ke anu kaa ek, yaa ek se adhik, hydrogen parmaanu dhaatuon, dhaatuon ke oxidon, hydroxidon athwa carboneton se visthapit ho jaataa he
 There are also some acids that are sweet instead of sour
 aisa ek amla amido-fosphrik amla he
 There are some acids which are not alkaline
 kuch aise bhi kshar hai jinka hydrogen dhaatuon se visthapit ho jaataa he
 Alum is not acid
 isamen visthapit honevaala koi hydrogen bhi nahin he
 But it is sour in taste and alkali in action
 yah nile litmus ko laal bhi kar detaa he
 Similarly sodium bisulfide is sour and alkali
 yah nile litmus ko laal karata he
 It also has displacing hydrogen, but it is not acid
 mithen amla nahin he, par iskaa hydrogen jaste se visthapit ho jaataa he or is prakaar zinc diemethil banataa he jo lavan nahin he
 Therefore, no satisfactory definition of acid has yet been given
 aayan siddhant ke aadhaar par yadi ham amlon kii paribhaasha dena chahen to kah sakate hai ki amlon main hydrogen yanon kaa rahanaa atyaavashyak he
 In 1659, Silvian first differentiated into acids and bases
 rule ne san 1774 main ksharak naam us padaarth ko diya jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaata he
 Nowadays, bases are those oxygen-rich substances that are supplemented by acids
 kshar dhaatuon, kshariyamruda dhaatuon or anya dhaatuon ke oxide or ve sabhi vastuen ksharak hai jo amlon ke saath milakar lavan banaati hai
 Initially the base was applied only to metals or oxides of metals that were "bases" or bases of salts
 lavenon ke ksharak aavashyak avyav hai
 Bases are actually substances that combine with acids to form salts and water
 udhaahrant:, zinc oxide salphurik amla ke saath milakar zinc sulphate or jal banaata he
 Dahk soda combines with sulfuric acid to form sodium sulfate and water
 dhaatuon ke oxide saamanyat: ksharak hai
 But there are exceptions to this
 ksharakon main dhaatuon ke oxide or hydraksaide hai, par suvidha ke liye tatwon ke kuch aise samooh bhi rakhe gaye hai jo amlon ke saath milakar bina jal bane hi lavan banaate hai
 Among such bases are ammonia, hydroxylamine and phosphine
 drav ammonia ghul jaataa he par phinolfaileen se koi rang nahin detaa
 Thus, to what extent can it be called base, this thing is doubtful
 yadhyapi upar kii ksharak kii paribhaasha badi asantoshprad he, tathaapi isse acchhee paribhaasha nahin di ja saki he
 Base and base are not synonyms
 sab kshar ksharak hai par sab ksharak kshar nahin hai
 Alkali-metal oxides, such as sodium oxide, dissolve in water to form hydroxides
 ye prabal ksharkeey hote hai
 Alkaline soil metal oxides, such as calcium oxides, are soluble in water and less alkaline
 anya dhaatuon ke oxide jal main ghulte nahin or unke hydraksaide paroksh ritiyon se hi banaae jate hai
 Oxides and hydroxides of metals are basic
 kshar dhaatuon ke oxide jal main sheeghra ghul jate hai
 Oxides of some metals are less soluble in water and oxides of some metals are not soluble even in water
 kuch adhaatuon ke hydride, jaise nitrogen or phosphorus ke hydride bhi bhasma hote hai

 She scolds Emma for spreading the mess, but then sees the footprints of a soaked child going out of the hall
 vah sidhiyon ke ant main ek billi ko dekhati he or safed bahon ke ek jode ko ise aaraam se uthaate hue dekhati he
 She goes upstairs and enters her bedroom
 The door closes behind him

 He gives a voice to his wife, who does not answer

 Before he can call an ambulance, the young boy named Toshio suddenly appears and surprises the cat by making a sound

 Later Matthew's sister, Susan, is preparing to leave the office

 She prepares to exit her office building but the sound of groaning from the corridor stops her

 The call of death accelerates through the phone holding Susan
 vah phone ko gira detii he or todatii he, phir bhi awaz suni ja sakati he
 Susannah hides under the bed in fear and removes the rabbit-topped pendant from her phone and throws it out of fear

 She is eventually seen as Kayako Seki Onroyo, who attacks her and drags her into the cell

 Karen is taken to the hospital while detectives ask Alex questions

 The detective finds that the phone's hand set is not in the cradle and he presses the page button
 ve ataari se aane vaali awaajon kii khoj karte hai jahaan unhen mathew or uski patni kii laashen milti hai
 They also make a frightening discovery of a human jaw and express surprise to whom it belongs and where the rest of the body may be

 Karen tells the detectives her story, emphasizing the boy's presence

 Horrified but determined she begins to search for the history of the house, she finally discovers the cause of the murders

 He sees Kayako coming in the hall, then in front of the camera, after which the video ends
 uske baad vah petrol ke do dibbe ke saath seki house main aata he
 He is distracted by the sound of Toshio drowning in the bath tub
 vah pravesh karata he or tub se baahar latake hue ek ladke ko dekhtaa he or use punerjeevit karne kii koshish karata he
 His eyes remain open and Takeo appears behind him
 naakagawa keval mud paata he jiske pehle taakeo use bathtub main dhakel detaa he or toshiyo kii tarah dubaa kar maar detaa he
 Karen asks Peter's widow, Maria Kirk, who does not know anything about the house, the occupants and the suicide of her husband
 vah karren ko puraani tasveeron ke madhyam se khoj karne kii anumati de detii he
 Karen sees Kayako clearly behind each couple, in the background of every photo
 uske baad karren apane premi dag he
 Karen sees in the flash back that Peter is searching for her body in the house
 taakeo dwaara kayako kii hatya kii krurta se dar kar karren ladkadhaate hue sidhiyaan utarati he or ghar vartmaan samay main pahunch jaataa he
 Doug grabs her ankle before she leaves

 a door opens above
 kayako ke rup main onryo sidhiyon se rengte hue neeche aata he or dag ko maut kaa chumban detaa he
 Karen opens the door, but suddenly Kayako's ghost arrives there
 vah daravaaza jor se band karti he or gas ke dibbon main se ek ko laat maarthi he
 She takes Dug's lighter and bounces it on the gas as Dug suddenly becomes a kayako
 screen safed ho jaati he
 
 aspataal main, karren ko pataa chalata he ki ghar jalane se batch gaya he or vah dag kii laash par shok vakt karti he
 Suddenly, Kayako's hair and arms come out from under the sheet covering her, but Karen realizes that this is just her imagination
 Kayako then appears behind Karen
 kayako dwaara uski maut kii aahat kii awaz nikalate samay, camera uski ankhon par tikne ke saath film samaapt ho jaati he
 She lives and works in Tokyo, and helps her brother, sister-in-law and mother choose and move into a new home
 asli ju-on: da graj main, taakeo dwaara kayako ko maarna screen par nahin dikhaaya jaataa he, sivaae ek shuruuaati drishy sanket ke jo use uski hatya ke baad dikhaata he
 This makes Kayako's ju-on murder a mystery
 uske sharir tathaa chehre, donon par kaatane ke nishaanon se aisa mana jaataa he ki use chote chaaku se maaraa gaya he
 The DVD release shows a deleted scene in which Takeo attacks Kayako with a small knife
 ek sambhaavna yah he ki kayako taakeo ko apane shayankaksh main apni diary padhate hue dekh leti he or vah use dhakka de kar neeche girte hue us par akraman karata he
 She runs down the stairs and Takeo follows her
 kayako taakeo dwaara ghir jaati he or daravaaje ke paas diwaar se sat jaati he
 Toshio is watching from the top of the stairs, he does not understand what is really happening
 taakeo uskaa galaa kaatane ke liye apana haath kayako ke chehre tak pahunchaata he
 Toshio goes and hides in his cell
 taakeo kayako ko apane shayankaksh main laata he or uske chehre ko chote chaaku se god detaa he
 He then wraps her in a plastic bag and puts her in the attic
 vah toshiyo ko dubo kar maar detaa he or uski billi kaa galaa kaat detaa he
 Takeo puts Toshio back in the closet with the cat
 kayako kaa sharir ataari main mila tha or kayako ke bhoot ke vajah se taakeo paas ke ek gali main mara tha
 
 However, it also seems likely that Kayako had his neck broken before he was hit by a knife, just as the sounds emanating from when he moved his neck
 rimek main, kayako kii hatya tab hoti he jab taakeo uski gardan tod detaa he
 The carnage is not shown on screen in the theater cut, but everything is shown in the director cut
 nirdeshak cat main, film ke ant main flash back ke dauraan dikhaaya gaya he ki kayako apane shayankaksh ke darvaaze ke paas khadi he or mahasoos karti he ki taakeo uski diary pard rahaa he or peter kark ke prati uske moh ke bare main jaanata he
 He then chases her down into the hallway and bends her ankle, dropping her to the ground, as well as screaming and stumbling on the walls
 kayako uske baad bachane ke prayaas main sidhiyon se neeche rengti he, kintu taakeo dwaara pakad lee jaati he jo uski gardan donon haathon se jakad letaa he

 haalanki mobile marketing kii avadharana ke liye vibhinn paribhaashaayen maujuud hai lekin inamen se koi bhi aam taur par sweekaarya paribhaasha nahin he
 Mobile marketing is broadly defined as "the use of a mobile medium as a means of marketing communication" or "the delivery of any promotional or advertising related messages to the customer through a wireless network"

 In November 2009, the Mobile Marketing Association updated its definition of mobile marketing: mobile marketing un gatividhiyon kaa ek samucchy he jo sanghathanon ko kisi mobile upkaran yaa network ke jariye ek parsparik or praasangik tareeke se apane darshakon se samvaad karne yaa unke saath judane main sakasham banaata he
 Mobile marketing is commonly known as wireless marketing

 For example, a consumer communicating with a website through a desktop computer at their home, for which the signal is being transmitted through a wireless local area network or a satellite, would be considered wireless but not mobile communication

 Mobile operators carefully check a short code application before provisioning it and monitor the service to ensure that it is not moving in a different direction from its original service description
 Another option to send a message via short code or e-mail is to do so through a person's own dedicated phone number
 In addition to short codes, inbound SMS is mostly based on long numbers that can be used in many applications such as the promotion of products
 And can be used in place of short codes or excellent-quality short messages to receive SMS in campaigns

 The issue of privacy has become even more prominent with the advent of mobile data networks

 Because the current telecommunications regulations in the European Union and the United States, particularly rules relating to the issue of unsolicited commercial communication and spam, have become outdated, new legislation should be applied for them
 The new laws should be more clear, flexible and comprehensive, but in spite of this they should be focused only on the issues that are most important
 yah isliye mahatvapurn he kyonki kanoon pratispardhaa ko badhaava dene, nivesh ko protsaahit karne, anaavashyak kharch main katautee karne or vyapaar kii baadhaon ko hataane vaala hona chahie

 Implementation of these rules should be done in a rational manner to avoid the introduction of new rules with too much seriousness by the courts as this would pose a risk of disrupting or limiting the progress of a very promising industry
 Consumers may not feel protected due to too lax interpretation of these rules, due to which progress may be limited
 duusare shabdon main agar gopneeyata ke bare main upabhoktaaon kii chintaaon par dhyaan nahin diya jaataa he to upabhokta vishwaas kii kami ke kaaran mobile vigyaapan kii pragati khatre main pad sakati he; upabhokta vishwaas kii isi kami ne i-mail marketing kii pragati ko bhi nirutsahit kiya tha

 Due to this, the molecules are able to form relationships with the remaining molecules

 tab swayan acharya ne usase vah shav hataane kaa anurodh kiya
 Hearing his request, the woman said- 'O sannyasin! You are repeatedly asking me to remove this body

 There was frequent movement of people associated with the film industry
 ek baar police stesan main film nirmaataa baldev dube kuch jaruri kaam ke liye aaye hue the
 He was impressed by Rajkumar's style of talking and offered Rajkumar to act as an actor in his film 'shahi Bazaar'
 rajkumaar sipaahi kii baat sunakar pehle hi abhinayta banane kaa man bana chuke the
 So he immediately resigned from his sub-inspector job and accepted the offer of the producer
 shahi bazaar ko banane main kaaphi samay lag gaya or rajkumaar ko apana jeevanyaapan karnaa bhi mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, he accepted a small role in the film 'rangeili' released in the year 1952
 yah film cinema gharon main kab lagi or kab chali gayi
 Did not realize it
 is bich unki film 'shahi bazaar' bhi pradarshit hui
 Which fell at the box office

 And some people started saying that you can become a villain
 varsh 1952 se 1957 tak rajkumaar film industry main apni jagah banane ke liye sangharsh karte rahe
 After 'rangeeli', Rajkumar went on to accept whatever role he got
 is bich unhone 'anmol' 'sahaara', 'avasar', 'ghamand', 'neelmani' or 'krishna sudama' jaisi kai filmon main abhinay kiya lekin inamen se koi bhi film box offis par safal nahin hui

 After this, Raj Kumar through success in films like 'dil Apna Aur Preet Parai-1960', 'gharana- 1961', 'godan- 1963', 'dil Ek Mandir- 1964', 'dooj ka Chand- 1964' Adding to his acting among the audience, he reached a situation where he could choose his role in the film himself
 varsh 1965 main pradarshit film kaajal kii jabardast kamyaabi ke baad raaj kumaar bataur abhinayta apni alag pahchaan bana lee
 In the 1965 BR Chopra film Waqt, he was able to attract the attention of the audience once again with his excellent acting
 film vaqt main raaj kumaar kaa bolaa gaya ek samvaad "chinay seth jinke ghar shishe ke bane hote he wo dusron pe pathar nahin phenkaa karte yaa phir chinay seth ye churi bacchon ke khilne kii chiz nahin haath cat jaye to koon nikal aata he" darshakon ke bich kaafii lokapriy hua
 With the success of the film, Raj Kumar reached the bulls of fame
 aisi sthiti jab kisi abhinayta ke saamne aati he to vah manamaani karne lagata he or khyaati chaa jane kii uski pravriti badhati jaati he or jald hi vah kisi khaas image main bhi bandha jaataa he
 But Raj Kumar never tied in any particular image, so even after the success of these films, he did 'hamraaz- 1967', 'neelkamal- 1968', 'mere Huzoor- 1968', 'heer Ranjha- 1970' and 'pakiza- Even in 1971 ', she accepted a romantic role which did not match her film character, yet Raj Kumar was successful in winning the audience's heart here
 varsh 1978 main pradarshit film karmyogi main raaj kumaar ke abhinay or vividhta ke nae aayam darshakon ko dekhne ko mili
 In this film, he made his mark in two different roles
 abhinay main ekarupatha se bachane or swayan ko charitra abhinayta ke rup main bhi sthapit karne ke liye raaj kumaar ne apane ko vibhinn bhoomikaaon main pesh kiya

 Raj Kumar, who was completely alone, probably felt that death was too close to him, so he called his son Puru Raj Kumar to him and said, "look, death and life are a personal matter of man
" meri maut ke bare main mere mitra chetan anand ke alaava or kisi ko nahin bataanaa
 To inform the film industry only after my last rites
 " Rajkumar, the Sartaj actor of the film world, left us on 3 July 1996
