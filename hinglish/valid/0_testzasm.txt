 Sixty-one Hindi literature is a literature composed by a generation in which the tone of rebellion and anarchy was predominant after the year 1960, under the history of Hindi literature, which is largely believed to be quite different from the New Age era
 haalaanki iske saath-saath sahajata evam janavaadee chetana kii samaanaantar dhara bhi sahitya-kshetra main pravahamaan rahi jo baad main pradhan ho gayi
 In the sixties, the rebellious consciousness movement became primarily vocal in the field of poetry
 isliye isse sambandhit saare aandolan mukhyatah kavita ke aandolan rahe
 However, the story and other genres too had a substantial impact and in the field of story also, a movement like 'akhani' took shape
 san saath ke aasapaas nayi kavita kii dhara apane se kuch alag hoti dikhne lagi
 The new twist that is targeted after sixty is not a new thing to look at all of a sudden, but only by new poetry
 saath ke baad kii kavita main asantosh, asweekruti or vidroh kaa swar bahut saaf taur par ubhara he
 The tone of dissatisfaction and disapproval is present in the new poem as well, but after sixty this tone has taken the form of more intense satire and rebellion, going too close to the broken idols of life, their brokenness, agony and rejection from it Has recognized the fierceness of nayi kavita kii sabase badi visheshta yahi he ki usne samgr jivan kii pramanik anubhutiyon ko unke jivant parivesh main vyakt kiya
 He understood the significance of the poem only in highlighting every small and big truth of life through symbols and images, by breaking the siege of the subject or cognition of the subject and made of different visions or promises
 lekin kul milakar nayi kavita ke kaviyon main pidaa ke baavjood bhavishya nirmaan ke prati sakaaratmak aashaa bhi bani rahi
 Due to the conditions of post-independence India, there was a lot of frustration and breakdown in them, but there was also a weak hope of fulfilling dreams
 mohabhang yaa disilusenment puure rup main nahin hua tha, isliye nayi kavita main yatnaa-bodh he, asweekruti kaa swar bhi he, kintu vidroh kaa ubhaar nahin he
 Gradually 'illusion' broke down, disillusioned
 vyakti kaa saamaajik parivesh or bhi kurup lagane laga, bhavishya ke sapane tuutate gayi
 In the words of Dr
 Bachchan Singh, there was no light in the sun grown by the poets - the reception of the sun went in vain
 anek sahityakaron ko do hi raste najar aane lage ki yaa to ve nayi kavita ke pradhan swar main swar milakar pidaa kii mukt anubhuti ko or gahanta se vyakt karte athwa ye sari paristhitiyaan unke samvedansheel man ko jhakazorkar or yatnaa ke bich se ubhar kar unhen vidrohi banaati hui sab-kuch asweekaar karne ko prerit karne lageen
 Both these streams remained in the literature, but immediately after the sixties, the rebel stream was predominant, most of which were malevolent or sexually perverse
 nirlakshya hone se ye kavitaayen suvidhaatmak rup se vidroh karne vaali huin yani jahaan vidroh karne main khatra anubhav ho vahaan nahin, jahaan suvidha ho vahaan vidroh hota rahaa
 The first decade of Sathotari Hindi literature is particularly influenced by modernism

 According to Dr
 Bachchan Singh, "modernity" is actually the name of new, non-romantic and non-romantic interviews of heterogeneous human conditions arising as a result of new knowledge-science and technology
 " Modernist literature is a special kind of literature
 yah sthapit samskruti, mulya or samvednaa ko asweekaar karti he
 It does not accept the beliefs of the world, adopting the tradition as fetters
 aadhuniktaavaadi antaryaatra karata he, mulyon kaa makhul udaata he, vah vidrohi hota he
 Opposes the crowd, is a believer of the person's salvation
 vah apane ko a-maanav kii sthiti main paata he, or sneh, kritagyata aadi ko nishkasit kar detaa he
 Its characteristics or 'motif' are lack of restraint, experimentation, sabotage of literature forms, attitude of giving shock, aspiration for resentment-violence etc
 nayi kavita se vilgau anubhav karte hue kavy-kshetra main jo anek pravritiyaan sakriy raheen, unamem sabase adhik ullekhneey he ginsburg aadi america bitanicon tathaa unase prabhavit bengal ke malay raichaudhuri or subimal basaa jaise bhukhi peedi ke kaviyon ke samanaantar hindi main ubharne vaale raajakmal choudhary tathaa akavita or asweekrut kavita se sambaddh kuch anya kavi jinhone 'hetro sexuality' evam 'open sikresi' kii beet dharanaon ko apanaakar samaaj se apane ko 'disephiliet' karne kaa praytn kiya
 Nude use of sexual terminology in his poetry is often found in the form of rites and mutilation to express his distress and resentment

 purvavarti samast mulyon or paramparaon ko nakaar kar ve apni chikhon, jakhmon or yon-vidrupataaon ko kavita main vyakt karte rahe
 However, the euthanistic, neo-progressive or neo-progressive poets, while emphasizing social values, expressed their disagreement with these beatniks
 nayi kavita ke uparant hindi kavy ke kshetra main thodi si hi avadhi main itane adhik naare sunai diye, itane adhik aandolan aaye ki vishwa ke kisi anya sahitya main itani kam avadhi main itane adhik naare or andolan kabhi nahin utpann hue
 Some of these movements and slogans were buried in the neck of time, but some grew on the path of development
 vastutah in andolanon kii poshak rachanaayen ek-duusare se milti-julati bhi raheen tathaa kabhi-kabhi to ek hi kavi kai andolanon kaa anugami rahaa
 This time of literature was a time of chaotic flood of movements
 mukhyatah kavita-pradhan in andolanon ke naam is prakaar hai- There were many pro-system movements along with anti-system movements in the poetry-movements that came like floods in this decade; But often there was a lack of systematic thinking in all these movements, due to which almost all these proved to be short-lived
 in donon prakaar ke mukhya andolanon kaa saamaanya parichay agrankit sheershakon main drashtavy he
 In the March 1962 issue of 'bharati', Sri Virendrakumar Jain announced the new poem 'sanatan Suryodayi'
 apana mantavya vyakt karte hue unka kahana tha ki " patan-paraajay, kuntha, atmpidana or jivit aatmghaat ke asujh andhkaar main aatmahaara dishaharaa hokar bhatak rahi aaj kii anaath kavy chetana ke sammukh ham-- alp se mahat main le jane vaali, andhkaar se prakaash main le jane vaali, mrityu se amrit main le jane vaali or seemaa main aseem kii lila ko utaar laane vaali-- aagaamee kal kii anivaary sanathan suryodayi nutan kavita dhara kaa dwaar mukt karte hai
 "thus the main tone of this movement was of the system, but only after 3 years, in the February 1965 issue of 'bharati', instead of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita', the tone of 'nutan Kavita' was heard
 gangaaprasad vimal jaise 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke bhootpurv samarthak swayan 'akavita' varg main sammilit ho gayi
 The Yuyotsavist poem is related to a magazine called 'yuyutsa'
 yuyutsavadi kavita ke pravartak shalab shriram singh the
 He has been of the opinion that primitive Yuyutsa is the main inspiration of literature
 unka kahana he ki "main sahityasarjan kii mul prerana ke rup main usee aadim yuyutsa ko sweekaarta hoon jo kahin na kahin prayek kranti, parivartan athwa vighatan ke mul main pramukh rahi he
 It can be anything young, zoological, puerile, platonic or platonic
 " april 1965 kii 'roopambara' main 'prarambh' ke antargat swadesh bhartiya dwaara 'sabakaa ek maatr kaaran yuyutsa' kii ghoshnaa karte hue shalab shriram singh kaa yah uddhran diya gaya tha
 'rupambara' itself appeared in the 'adhyunatan Kavita issue' of August 1966 as a 'yuyotsavist Navlakhan Pradhan co-operative effort', with statements from three poets
 sampadak ne nayi samvedansheeltaa kii baat bhi uthaayi
 Vimal Pandey, Rameshwaradatta Manav, Om Prabhakar, Bajrang Bishnoi etc
 also related themselves to this movement
 vimal pandeya ne 'yuyutsawad' ko 'engri yang main' se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya
 Shri Om Prabhakar considers Yuyutsa as a synonym for Jeejivisha, considering 'wariness' to be an eternal instinct
 bajrang bishnoi ne patibaddhta ke prashn ko yuyutsa se jod diya he
 In the July '66 issue of 'utkarsh' magazine, Shriram Shukla raised the slogan of 'rejected Poetry' and introduced 'long Rejected Poem' titled 'sexual intercourse with dead woman'
 shukla ji ke liye 'sambhog kaa anubhav hi paryaapt he-- saat mahakavy likh le jane ke liye
 The poet of the spokesperson of the rejected poem believes - "the asymmetry of not telling the truth as truth is sometimes broken by breaking the barrier and only then is the birth of the rejected poem
" " tathaa "prastut yug main vyaapt, yatharth hote hue bhi asweekrut vishisht pravritiyon, sanvegon, sthitiyon, mulyon, asangatiyon or mood kii sampreshak kavita he
 "rejected poetry is a poem of sexual perversions
 ashleel shabdon kaa prayog inke liye sahaj sweekrut he tathaa inke anusaar ye 'naapsand vyavasthaaon ko badalane ke liye' vyagr hai
 Even if they cannot present a solution, they consider it their duty to 'draw the attention of the insane people by putting question marks on them'
 'akavita' kaa sutaradhar dow0 shyaam parmaar ko mana gaya he, parantu jagadish chaturvedi bhi unke saath baraabar ke bhagidaar the or 'akavita' ke aarambhik prastaavkon main the
 In fact, there were three editors of 'akvita' magazine - Jagdish Chaturvedi, Shyam Parmar and Rabindranath Tyagi
 'akavita' patrika main akavita ke samarthan main saidhantik lekh praayah nahin chaape jate the
 Those people believed that 'we will not speak'
 parantu, dow0 shyaam parmaar ne akavita ke samarthan main 'akavita or kala-sandarbh' sheershak se baqayada pustak bhi likhi, jisamen bahuvidh akavita ko paribhaashit karne kaa praytn kiya gaya
 Jagdish Chaturvedi calls this poetry as 'abhinav Kavya', due to the awareness of the monotony, inconsistency and sacramental expression of life lived on the intellectual level by the poets of this class and separation from the ancient tradition of poetry
 Are that "they can be enumerated as meaningful carriers of 'anti-poetry'"
 " parantu shyaam parmaar akavita ko anti kavita yaa kavita virdohi nahin maanate
 They consider Akavita to be an 'investigative poem of contradictions'
 unke anusaar is kavyandolan kii visheshta is tathy main he ki "kaviyon kii pravritiyaan alag-alag manahosthitiyon se judi hai
 "" Akavita is a tenacious poem
 vah simit samay kii kavita hogi, kyonki use bhavishya main jhande nahin gaadna hoga
 Many levels of expression are possible in "and" avaita
 bhashaa or kathy main vah patibaddh nahin he, isliye 'flexbal' he
 It has complex and 'tipsy' processes - straight and broken things
 " akavita ke pravaktaa kavi ne yah bhi ullekh kiya he ki "akavita ke liye nayi kavita yaa navagit virodh yogya nahin hai
 People of the movement instinctively call it a faction or conspiracy
 " Akvita's movement was also accused of being associated with the Beatnik movement
 parantu, iske prastaavkon jagadish chaturvedi evam shyaam parmaar ne bitanicon ke vyavhaar ko spashtatah nindaneey bataaya tathaa usase 'akavita' ke judaav se bilkul inkaar kiya
 The names of Girijakumar Mathur, Prabhakar Machwe, Bharat Bhushan Aggarwal, Vimal and Atul etc
 were also found in the proposers of 'akvita' magazine, which originated from 1965 to 67
 is sandarbh main saumitr mohan tathaa mudrarakshas kii rachanaayen bhi ullekhneey hai
 Dr
 Prabhakar Machwe due to American Beatnik influence, Rajkamal Chaudhary due to Bangla influence and Trilochan and Shamsher Bahadur Singh due to Ginsberg influence also associated themselves with beat poetry
 'kriti' or 'abhivyakti' naamak patrikaon main machave ji ne apni dharna ko ghoshit bhi kiya
 Poets of 'rebel generation' published from Allahabad also showed this effect indirectly
 'taaji kavita' ke pravartak lakshmikant verma the
 Verma ji was one of the great supporters of the first 'new poem'
 unhone nayi kavita ke saidhantik vishleshan se sambandhit pehali mahatvapurn pustak likhi thi 'nayi kavita ke pratimaan'
 However, later on changing the recognition, he became the promoter of 'fresh poetry'
 unhone 'taaji kavita' kaa andolan isliye chalaaya ki nayi kavita main ab kuch 'nayaapan' bhi shesh na rah gaya tha or vah ek khaas rup main pratishthit bhi ho chuki thi
 Varma ji also said that "much of the new poem was indirectly taken up by Naibhinal taking the vitality from the shadows
 " haalaanki 'taji kavita' kaa yah andolan bhi aage chal nahin sakaa
 Not even a single poet or writer who accompanied Verma ji appeared until July 1965 and "without any noise, 'fresh poetry' was buried in its own right
 " The name of Dr
 Parmanand Shrivastava is associated with committed poetry
 dow0 shrivastav kii dharna he : "main maanata hoon ki kavita ke saamne iske sivaay doosraa vikalp nahin he ki vah aaj kii sampurna manavniyati kaa saakshaatkaar kare or poonjeewaadi vyavastha dwaara prerit amanavikaran ke viruddh sangharsh kare
 "and" language is an important tool in the realm of committed poetry - the above struggle
 " dow0 shrivastav ne sangharsh ke swaroop ko bhi aage paribhaashit kiya he-- "patibaddh kavita main sangharsh sidhaa or sarthak shabd he-- uskaa koi chhadmavesh nahin he-- jo log kisi kism kii patibaddhta ko sweekaar nahin karte ve jhootha sangharsh rachate hai or us main majaa lete hai
 Thus, this movement was a system of movement away from modernism or anarchy and was a form of Marxism
 iske peeche ek vichaardhaara, ek raajnneetik drushti thi
 Dr
 Ravindra Bhramar, the narrator of Sahaja poetry, has been considered
 is andolan kaa bhi aadhuniktawaad yaa araajaktaa se dur dur tak koi sambandh nahin tha
 Its supporters included Acharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Acharya Nandadulare Vajpayee, Agnayya, Dinkar, Dr
 Nagendra, Dr
 Devaraj, Dr
 Indranath Madan, Dr
 Prabhakar Machve and Ramdarash Mishra
 dow0 shyaam parmaar tathaa raajakmal choudhary ne bhi ise samarthan diya tha
 In March 1967, the release of Sahaj Kavita was published
 vijyapti ke kuch ansh is prakaar hai-- "san '60 ke baad ek varg main manarism kaa croftmanship ko hi mul lakshya mana or hindi kavita kul milakar tedi rekhaon ke vyapaar ke rup main saamne aayi
 That is why it has been fashion and not very meaningful

 Dr
 Parmanand Srivastava, Rajendra Prasad Singh, Dr
 Kumar Vimal, Shrikant Joshi, Dr
 Shyamsunder Ghosh, Dr
 Vishwambharanath Upadhyay, Dr
 Ganapatichandra Gupta and Shivapratap Singh supported Sahaja Kavita in their articles of collection called 'sahaja Kavita' published in 1968 AD
 dow0 rabindra bhramar ne apane lekh main sahaj kavita ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya-- "prastut sandarbh main 'sahaj' shabd kaa vyutpattimulk arth lenaa hoga 'sah jaayate iti sahajah
 'that is, the creation which takes birth in the tangible medium of speech with true sensation momentum, it is easy
 is drushti se anubhuti kii pramanikta praathmik vastu he
 If the feeling is direct and authentic, then the expression will be unnatural and uncomplicated
 " tathaa "sahaj kii maang vyashtimulak hote hue bhi samajasaapeksh he
 "dr
 Bhramar has also associated the question of commitment with Sahaja poetry:" Sahaja poetry is fully committed to the life and creative responsibility of his era
 uske mul main sahaj sampurna jivan kii pratiti or sahaj sugathit shilp ke madhyam kii khoj kaa ek eemaandaar praytn nihit he
 " navagit kaa naam farvari 1958 main mujffarpur se prakashit 'gitangini' naamak patrika main dikhaai diya
 Some new songs were also compiled in this magazine
 kuch lekhak navagit kaa vikaas nayi kavita ke hi samanaantar maanate hai or use nayi kavita kii ek vishesh style maanate hai
 The first collected anthology of 'navgeet', 'kavita', was published in 1964 in the editing of Om Prabhakar
 iske saath hi dow0 rabindra bhramar, ramdarsh mishra tathaa dow0 ramesh kuntal megh navagit ke pravaktaaon ke rup main saamne aaye
 In this compilation, songs of many lyricists from Nirala to the new generation were compiled
 navagit kaa yah andolan anya saathottaree kshanjivi andolanon se bilkul bhinn rahaa
 Neither it had anything to do with anarchy etc
 nor any tendency to give that kind of shock etc
 yah vidha apane aap ko sthapit kar chuki he
 Cooling towers are heat removal devices that are used to release processed waste heat into the atmosphere
 kooling towers main sansaadhit ushma ko nikaalane ke liye pani ke vashpikaran ke liye yaa to wet-balb vaale vaayu taapmaana ke sameep kriyasheel taral ko thanda karne ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he yaa phir dry-balb vaale vaayu taapmaana ke sameep kriyasheel taral ko thanda karne ke liye puri tarah se vaayu par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he
 Common applications include cooling water used to cool oil refineries, chemical plants, power plants and buildings
 towers choti chat se lekar badi chat vaali bahut badi andakaar sancharanaayen ho sakati hai jinaki oonchai lagbhag 200 meter tak oonchi or chaudaai 100 meter tak yaa aaytkaar sanrachana ke samaan ho sakati hai jinaki unchai 40 meter tak or lambaai 80 meter tak ho sakati he
 Smaller towers are usually built in the factory, while the elders are built on site
 unhen aamtaur par parmaanu urja sanyantron se jod kar dekha jaataa he
 The oval cooling tower was patented in 1918 by Friedrich van Itterson and Gerard Kuipers
 kooling towers kaa vargeekaran aamtaur par HVAC yaa audyogic duty ke rup main rentail, rogelito or stronold, april dwaara apni pustak da mistry of towers anfolded main bataaya gaya he, ke anusaar kiya ja saktaa he
 An HVAC cooling tower is a subcategory that releases heat from the chiller
 pani se thande hone vaale chiller main aamtaur par wet-balb ke taapmaana par yaa uske sameep tower ke pani main ooshmaa ko chhodane ke kaaran hawa dwaara thande hone vaale chiller kii tulana main urja kii khapat kam hoti he
 Air cooled chillers should be left at heat dry-bulb temperatures and thus have a counterclockwise-carnot circular effect of minimum average
 bade-bade karyaalay vaali imaaraton, aspataalon or vishesh rup se skulon main lagaae jane vaale air condishning system ke rup main ek yaa ek se adhik kooling towers kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Typically, industrial cooling towers are much larger than HVAC towers
 HVAC main prayukt hone vaale kooling towers main kooling tower ke saath-saath pani dwaara thande hone vaale chiller yaa pani dwaara thande hone vaale condencers kaa upyog hota he
 One ton of air-conditioning extracts 12,000 Btu / hr
 vastav main, kooling tower kii sataha par samatuly ton urja kii ooshmaa-samatulyata ke kaaran lagbhag 15,000 beatiu / ghanta nikaalane ke liye chiller compressure ko chalaane kii jarurat hoti he
 This equivalent ton is defined as the removal of heat in cooling 3 US gallons / min of water 10 ° F, which is approximately 15000 Btu / hr, or 4
0 k coefficient of performance
 yah COP urja kaaryakshmata anupaat 13

 Industrial cooling towers can be used to extract heat from various sources such as machinery or hot process materials
 bade audyogic kooling towers kaa mul upyog bijli sanyatron, petroleum shodhashalaon, petrochemical sanyatron, prakritik gas sansaadhan sanyantron, bhojan sansaadhan sanyantron, semi-contactor sanyatron or anya audyogic suvidhaon vaale parisanchari thande pani main avashoshit ooshmaa nikaalane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The rate of cold water flow to a typical 700 MW coal-fired power plant is about 71,600 cubic meters per hour in a cooling tower, and perhaps 5 percent is required to be supplied for the water to flow
 yadi us sanyantr main kooling tower nahin he or lagaataar thanda hone vaale pani kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, to iske liye lagbhag 100,000 cubic meter prati ghante pani kii aavashyaktaa hogi or is pani maatra ko nirantar rup se mahaasaagar, jhil yaa nadi main pahunchaana padegaa jahaan se yah aayaa tha isaki aapurti pun: sanyantr ko kerani padegi
 iske atirikt, nadi yaa jhil ke taap main badi maatra main chode gaye garm pani ke kaaran uske taapmaana main vruddhi ho sakati he jo sthaneey paristhitiki tantra ke str ke asahneeya ho saktaa he
 Fish and other aquatic organisms may die as water temperatures rise
 iske bajaay kooling tower ooshmaa ko paryaavaran evam hawa main chodta he or vaayu prasar ushma ko garm pani kii tulana adhik bade kshetra par failaa detaa he jiske kaaran ushma jal sroton main vibhajit ho jaati he
 Some coal-based and nuclear-based power plants installed in coastal areas have sustainable use of ocean water
 lekin phir bhi, vaataavaraniya samasyaon se bachane ke liye ofshor discharge water outlet ke liye atyadhik saavdhaneepurvak dizine taiyaar karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Petroleum refineries also have very large cooling tower systems
 kisi vishisht badi shodhashala jisamen 40,000 metric ton crude oil pratidin parisanchaarit hota he uske kooling tower ke liye lagbhag 80,000 ghan meter pani prati ghante kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The world's highest altitude cooling tower is the Netheruse power station, which has a height of 200 meters
 ooshmaa chhodane ke liye lagaayi gayi prakriyaayein mukhyat: teen prakaar kii hoti hai: In a wet cooling tower, hot water can be cooled to a lower temperature than the dry-bulb temperature with ambient air if the air is relatively dry
 
 embeant vaayu ko pani ke saath chode jane par vashpikaran hota he
 Evaporation occurs as a result of saturated air conditions, causing the water temperature to be lower than the air temperature of the wet bulb, which is lower than the ambient dry bulb air temperature, which is determined by the humidity of the ambient air
 
 behatar pradarshan praapt karne ke liye, vaayu evam pani ke pravaah ke bich sataha ko badhaane ke liye upyog kiye jane vaale madhyam phil kehalaata he
 Splash fill contains material that blocks the flow of water due to the splash
 film phil saamagree kii patali paraton se bani hoti he jiske upar se hokar pani bahata he
 Both methods increase the surface area
 tower ke madhyam se hawa ko khinchne ke sambandh main teen prakaar ke kooling towers hai: Elliptical cooling towers All natural cooling towers have become standard designs due to their structural robustness and minimal use of materials
 golakaar akruti thanda karne kii kaaryakshmata main sudhaar karne hetu urdhvagami sanvahani vaayu pravaah ke gativardhan main sahaayta bhi karata he
 They are especially associated with nuclear power plants
 haalanki, yah sambandh galat he kyonki is prakaar ke kooling towers kaa upyog koyala aadhaarit urja sanyantron main bhi hota he
 In the same way, not all nuclear plants have cooling towers but they cool their heat conductors with lake, river or ocean water
 crossflo ek aisa dizine he jisamen vaayu kaa pravaah pani ke pravaah kii lambavat disha main hota he 
 vaayu kaa pravaah kooling tower main saamagree ko bharne ke liye ek yaa ek se adhik lambavat sataha se hokar pravisht hoti he
 Water flows through Phil by gravity
 hawa lagaataar phil se hokar guzarati rahati he or is prakaar se pani khule nikaay vaale kshetra se hokar pravaahit hota he
 a deep-bottomed distribution or hot water basin that has holes or nozzles at the bottom is used in a crossflow tower
 gurutv bhari saamagree ko nogel ke madhyam se pani ko samaan rup se failaa detaa he
 In a counterflow design, the airflow flows in exactly the opposite direction of the water
 The air to flow first enters the open area below the fill media and then flows vertically
 pani kaa chhidkaav tej dabaav vaali nogel se kiya jaataa he or phil se hokar, vaayu pravaah kii vipareet disha main neeche kii disha main pravaahit hota he
 Same for both designs: donon crossflo or countflo dizinon kaa upyog prakritik draft or yantric draft kooling towers main kiya ja saktaa he
 Some modern power plants equipped with flue gas refining such as the power station Staddinger Grasskrotenberg and the cooling tower at the power station Rosstoke are used as a flue gas stack
 flu gas shodhan rahit sanyantron main jang sambandhi samasyaayein ho sakati hai
 As a result, material balances around the wet cooling tower, functional variables of flow rate reimbursed to the evaporative cooling tower system, evaporation and air friction erosion, flow rate and concentricity cycle are carried out: uparokt rekhachitr main, nichle basin se choda gaya pani thanda pani kisi audyogic suvidha main coolers or contancers prakriya ke raste pani ko thanda karata he
 Cold water absorbs the heat from the hot process stream that needs to be cooled or condensed and the absorbed heat heats the flowing water
 garm pani kooling tower ke sheersh kii taraf laut jaataa he or tower main bhari saamagree par neeche kii ore tapakataa he
 As it drips downwards, it comes into contact with the air raised from the tower by natural or forced drafts using large wings in the tower
 uske sampark ke kaaran kuch pani vaayu gharshan ke rup main villin ho jaataa he or kuch pani kaa vashpikaran ho jaataa he
 The heat required for water evaporation is met by water that cools the water back to the same temperature as the original basin water and the water is then ready to recirculate
 pani ke vashpikaran ke kaaran ghule hue lavan baaki pani main rah jate hai jo vashpikrut nahin hota, is prakaar se parisanchari thande pani main lavan sandrata main vruddhi hoti he
 In order to prevent increasing the concentration of salt concentration in water, some amount of water is released in it
 tab vashpikrut pani kii kshatipurti ke liye tower ke basin main sanchit taaje pani kii aapurti kii jaati he
 Remaining water in the entire system: chunki vashpikrut pani main koi lavan nahin hote, to system main chloride kii maatra lagbhag hogi: And therefore: kooling tower ke chaaro ore kisi saral ooshmaa santulan se: Friction losses from large-scale industrial cooling towers can be considered in the absence of manufacturing data as follows: sandrata chakra pun: parisanchari thande pani main ghule khanijon ke sanchayan ko darshata he
 Theoretical extract is used to control the accumulation of these minerals
 sanchit pani ke rasinic gun jaise ghule khanijon kii maatra main kaaphi antar ho saktaa he
 Accumulated water in dissolved water such as those from which water is supplied from ground water to hard metals
 jameen ke sanchit pani jisamen aamtaur se khanijon kii maatra adhik hoti he or unhen se alag karnaa chahie
 The salinity of the water can be reduced by increasing the amount of minerals present for the water to flow into the pipes through the cycle, although the excess of minerals may cause separation problems
 chunki sandrata chakra kaa pani ko badhanaa se pani main ghule khanijon ko nikaalan paanaa sambhav nahin he
 When the fusion of these minerals increases, they can be extruded as solid minerals, which can cause fouling and heat conversion problems in cooling towers or heat exchangers
 iskaa nirdhaaran punauparisancharan pani kaa taap, pipe or ushma dharaatal ko parivartit karte hai or khanij pun: parisanchaarit pani main kahaan par ghaneebhoot kiye ja sakate hai
 Typically a professional water treatment consultant will perform the accumulated water treatment and make appropriate suggestions for the operating conditions and concentration cycle of the cooling tower
 pani shodhan rasayan, purv-shodhan jaise pani ko mridul bananaa, ph samaayojan or anya takneekein sandratha chakra kii sweekaareeya sankhya ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 The number of concentration cycles in most cooling towers can usually range from 3 to 7
 sanyukt rajya america main adhiktar svachh pani kii aapurti hoti he or usamen ek vishisht maatra main thos tatv ghule hote hai
 On the other hand, the highest water supply in New York City has significantly reduced the level of minerals on the ground and allowed concentrations of 7 or more cycles of concentration in that city
 bade-bade audyogic tower system main safai or dooshan ko kam karne ke liye parisanchari thande pani kaa upachaar karne ke alaava pani ko filter kiya janaa chahie or pani ke satat pravaah main hastkshep ko rokane ke liye biosida or alegsids kii uchit maatra di jaani chahie
 For closed loop volatile towers, corrosion resistors may be used but local environmental regulators must be met as some resistors use chromates
 aas paas kii sthitiyaan pani vaashp kii kshamta ke kaaran kisi tower kii kaaryakshmata kii vyakhya karti hai to vaayu use avashoshit yaa sokh leti he jiskaa nirdhaaran manometiya chart par kiya ja saktaa he
 The other most important reason for the use of biocides in cooling towers is to inhibit the growth of species such as Legionella, such species as L
 There is Niyamorphila
 vibhinn lijonela prajatiyaan maanav main lijonares naamak rog hota he or iskaa sanchaaran airosol-bacteria vaale dhul ke chote-chote kanon ko saans ke saath sharir main jane se hota he
 Common sources of Legionella include cooling towers that are used in open re-circulating evaporated cold water systems, household water systems, fountains and similar desminators that supply public water
 prakritik sroton main taaze pani vaale talab or choti nadiyaan shaamil hai
 Researchers in France found that Legionella is spread by air for about six kilometers from a giant contaminated cooling tower at a petrochemical plant in passe-de-kelleis, France
 iske failane kaaran 86 main se 21 logon kii maut ho gai jiske sankraman pushti prayogshaala main kii gayi
 Drift is the period for small drops of the flow process that is used to protect against water released from the cooling tower
 drift ilimonetters kaa upyog drift dar, vishesh rup se pravaah dar ko 0,001% se -0
005% tak banaae rakhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The special drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of air flow while protecting against water droplets
 acchhee tarah se taiyaar dizine or acchhee tarah se feet drift ilimonetter lijonela yaa anya rasaynic pradarshan ke liye pani kii kami yaa sambhaavna ko vishesh taur se kam kar sakate hai
 Many government agencies, cooling tower manufacturers and industrial trade organizations have designed and maintained guidelines for the development or control of Legionella in cooling towers, such as its prevention or control
 neeche aise dishanirdesh sroton kii suchi di gai he: Under certain ambient conditions, water vapor can be misted by water emanating from a cooling tower and mistaken as smoke coming out of the fire
 yadi bahari hawa main santrupt yaa uske samaan he or tower vaayu main adhik pani ko badhaate hai, to taral pani kii santrupt buundon ko vaayu main choda ja saktaa he - jise dhundh ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 This phenomenon typically occurs on cold, humid days, but is not possible in all climates
 thik se kaam nahin karne vaale kooling towers bahut thande mausam main jam sakate hai
 Typically, the cooling of a cooling tower starts from its corner in the event of low or no heat load
 badhati thand vaali sthitiyon ke kaaran barf ke aaytan main vruddhi sambhav he, jiske parinamswaroop sanrachanaatmak bhaar bad saktaa he
 In winter, 40 ° f are run continuously along with releasing water from the tower in some places
 basin heater, tower drendown or anya chiller sangrakshan vidhiyon ko aksar thandi jalwaayu main lagaaya jaataa he
 Cooling towers that are constructed on the basis of complete or partially combustible material can be helpful in spreading indoor fires
 iske parinamswaroop paryaapt rup se ghaatak ho saktaa he jiske liye sampurna diwaar yaa tower kii sanrachana ko pratisthaapan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 For this reason, some codes and standards that require combustible cooling towers will be provided with automatic fire fighting systems
 During tower maintenance, a fire may erupt in the tower structure when the cell is not in use, and in particular the catalytic-draft type, resulting in a relatively dry space in the tower
 bahut badi sanrachanaon hone ke naate, ve vaayu kshati ke prati atisamvedansheel hai or ateet main aisi bahut si asaadhaaran vifaltaaon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 At the Ferrybride power station, the station's location suffered major structural failure on 1 November 1965 when the cooling towers were destroyed due to the vibrating winds of 85 mph
 haalanki kooling towers kii sanrachanaon kaa nirmaan tej gati se chalane vaali hawaaon kaa saamana karne ke uddeshy ke liye kiya gaya tha, jisase kiko pashchimi hawaaen chakra banaati hue towers se hoti hui keepakar main guzar saken
 mul aath kooling towers main teen towers nasht ho gaye or baaki paanch buree tarah se kshatigrast ho gaye
 Eight towers were rebuilt and all eight cooling towers were built to withstand the weather adverse conditions

 Aur Gham Hai was an Indian television serial in the early 1980s that aired on Doordarshan
 isaki 32 kadiyaan prasaarit hui jinamein manoranjan or saamaajik shiksha kaa mishran hua karata tha
 In every installment of this serial, which was broadcast once every two weeks, a social evil was made and a story based on it
