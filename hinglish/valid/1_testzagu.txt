 Hindustani classical music is one of the two major styles of Indian classical music
 duusari pramukh style he - karnataka sangeet
 It is a traditional evolution that gave a new dimension to the direction of Indian music with the spread of Muslim civilization in the 11th and 12th centuries

 "medieval Muslim singers and heroes maintained Indian rites
 " The royal court became the main patron of music and while many rulers encouraged the rich tradition of ancient Indian music, they also made many changes to it according to their need and interest
 hindustani sangeet keval uttar bharat kaa hi nahin
 There is also classical music from Bangladesh and Pakistan
 yah parampar he ki jo utkrisht kalakaar ek darje ki uplabdhi hasil ki ho unhe mul rup se hindu vidwaan kalakaaro ko bhav muslim vidwaan kalakaaro ko ke khitaab se nawaja jaat he
 There is also another aspect of the Hindustani music, which was the religious separation of the Sufi, which the master used to remember the Gods of Kalakar Geet to remember God

 On 11 December 2014, for the first time after so much fame, the United Nations General Assembly has recognized 21 June each year as World Yoga Day
 bhagavadgita pratishthit granth mana jaataa he
 The word yoga has been used many times in it, sometimes alone and sometimes in particular, such as Buddhayoga, Sanyasayoga, Karmayoga
 vedottar kaal main bhaktiyog or hathyog naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai patanjali yogadarshan main kriyayog shabd dekhne main aata he
 Words like Pashupat Yoga and Maheshwar Yoga also have references
 in sab sthalon main yoga shabd ke jo arth hai vah ek duusare ke virdohi hai parantu is prakaar ke vibhinn prayogon ko dekhne se yah to spasht ho jaataa he, ki yoga kii paribhaasha karnaa kathin kaary he
 The definition should be such that it is free from imprecision and extraterrestrial defects, to describe such a symptom of the meaning of the word yoga which is suitable for every subject and is not suitable for anything other than yoga
 ‘yoga’ shabd ‘yuj samadhu’ aatmanepadi divadiganiya dhaatu main ‘ghan’ pratyay lagane se nishpann hota he
 In this way, the word 'yoga' means samadhi, that is, the removal of the mind
 vaise ‘yoga’ shabd ‘yujir yoga’ tathaa ‘yuj sanyamne’ dhaatu se bhi nishpann hota he kintu tab is sthiti main yoga shabd kaa arth kramshah yogafal, jod tathaa niyaman hoga
 In Yoga further, we will see that Yoga has also been said about the soul and God
 gita main shrikrishna ne ek sthal par kaha he 'yoga: karmsu kaushalm' 
 It is clear that this sentence is not the definition of yoga
 kuch vidwaanon kaa yah mat he ki jeevatma or paramatma ke mil jane ko yoga kehete hai
 It takes great objection to accept that even Buddhists, who do not accept the authority of God, behave and support the word Yoga
 yahi baat sankhyavaadiyon ke liye bhi kahi ja sakati he jo ishwar kii satta ko asiddh maanate hai
 In Yogadarshan, Pantjali, which has given the definition as 'yogashtantavritti nirodha', is the name of the prevention of the chrittis
 is vaakya ke do arth ho sakate hai: chittavritiyon ke nirodh kii avasthaa kaa naam yoga he yaa is avasthaa ko laane ke upaay ko yoga kehete hai
 But many scholars have objected to this definition
 unka kahana he ki chittavritiyon ke pravaah kaa hi naam chitt he
 Complete detention would mean the complete omission of the existence of the mind, the removal of all the memories and rituals of the mind
 yadi aisa ho jaae to phir samadhi se uthanaa sambhav nahin hoga
 Because no sacrament would have survived for the support of that stage, the destiny would have been burnt
 nirodh yadi sambhav ho to shrikrishna ke is vaakya kaa kya arth hoga? yogasth: kuru karmani, yoga main sthit hokar karm karo
 There can be no karma in the antithesis and in that state no sanskars can be performed, memories cannot be made, which are helpful in performing karma after getting up from samadhi
 sankshep main aashay yah he ki yoga ke shastreey swaroop, uske darshanik aadhaar, ko samyak rup se samajhnaa bahut saral nahin he
 The monotheist who believes the world to be false also supports him in the name of Nididhyahna

 Not only Buddhists, Muslim Sufis and Christian Mystics also somehow manage to reconcile them with the beliefs and philosophical principles of their sect

 Here, it is necessary to think a little about the process whose outline we find in Patanjali's formulas
 thode bahut shabdabhed se yah prakriya un sabhi samudaayon ko maanya he jo yoga ke abhyaas kaa samarthan karte hai
 The description of the means by which many seekers used to reach the high stage of yoga, samadhi, moksha, kaivalya etc
 was found in the Yoga texts from time to time
 usee ko yoga ke prakaar se janaa jane laga
 In the authentic books of Yoga, the description of four types of yoga is found in Shiva Samhita and Gorakshatak - uparyukt donon shlokon se yoga ke prakaar hue : mantrayog, hathyog layayog va rajyog
 The common meaning of 'mantra' is - 'mannat triyate iti mantra'
 man ko traay mantra hi he
 Mantra yoga is related to the mind, the mind is defined as- Manan iti manah
 jo manan, chintan karata he vahi man he
 Mantra yoga is to curb the agility of the mind through a mantra
 mantra yoga ke bare main yogatvopanishad main varnan is prakaar he- Mantra produces sound waves
 Mantra affects both body and mind
 mantra main sadhak jap kaa prayog karata he mantra jap main teen ghatakon kaa kaaphi mahatv he ve ghatak-uccharan, lay va taal hai
 The correct ratio of the three increases the mantra strength
 mantrajp mukhyarup se chaar prakaar se kiya jaataa he
 The literal meaning of hatha is derived from stubbornly doing something
 hath pradipika pustak main hath kaa arth is prakaar diya he- The meaning of h is said to be Sun and the meaning of Moon
 surya or chandra kii samaan avasthaa hathyog he
 There are several thousand nadis in the body, three major nadis are described in them, they are as follows
 suryanadi arthath pingala jo daahine swar kaa pratik he
 Chandranadi means Eda which signifies the left voice
 in donon ke bich teesri naadee sushumna he
 Thus Hatha Yoga is the action in which the soul is entered into the Sushumna Nadi with the help of Pingala and Ida Nadi and is consecrated in Brahmarandra
 hath pradipika main hathyog ke chaar angon kaa varnan he- asana, pranayam, mudra or bandh tathaa nadanusdhaan
 The Gherandasamhita has seven limbs - Shatkarma, Asana, Mudrabandha, Pranayama, Dhyana, Samadhi whereas Yogatattopanishad describes eight organs - Yama, Niyam, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, illusions
 chitt kaa apane swaroop villin hona yaa chitt kii niruddh avasthaa layayog ke antargat aata he
 When walking, sitting, sleeping and eating in the mind of a seeker, he should be aware of the Brahm at all times, this is called lāyoga
 yogatvopanishad main is prakaar varnan he- Raja Yoga is said to be the king of all yogas, because some material of each type of yoga is definitely found in it
 rajyog maharishi patanjali dwaara rachit ashtaang yoga kaa varnan aata he
 The theme of Raja Yoga is to curb the attitudes
 maharishi patanjali ke anusaar samahit chitt waalon ke liye abhyaas or vairaygy tathaa veikshipt chitt waalon ke liye kriyayog kaa sahaara lekar aage badhane kaa rasta sujhaayaa he
 By using these tools, the afflictions of the seeker are destroyed, the light of knowledge spreads in the mind and attains wisdom
 rajyog ke antargat mahirsh patanjali ne ashtaang ko is prakaar bataaya he- The first five out of the eight organs of yoga come out in three colors and the other three

 Many sculptures that display common yoga or samadhi mudra have been found at the site of the Indus Valley Civilization
 puraatatvajna gregory possehl ke anusaar," ye murtiyan yoga ke dharmik sanskaar" ke yoga se sambandh ko sanket karti he
 Although there is no conclusive proof of this, in the opinion of many pundits there is a relation between Indus Valley Civilization and yoga-meditation
 dhyaan main ucch chaitanya ko praapt karne ki ritiyon kaa vikaas shramanik paramparaon dwaara evam upanishad kii parampara dwaara viksit hua tha
 There is no concrete evidence about meditation in the ancient and ancient Brahminic texts of the Buddha, based on the sentences of the two Buddha's teachers towards the goals of meditation, Vayana argues that the method of Nirguna meditation originated from the Brahmin tradition, hence the Upanishads
 There is a similarity in the sayings towards the creation and the sayings for the goals of meditation
 yah sambhavit ho bhi saktaa he, nahin bhi
 In the Upanishads, in the cosmic statements of cosmic statements, they argue for the possibility of the practice of any meditation, saying that the Narada Sukta also points towards the method of meditation before the Rig Veda
 yah buddha granth shaayad sabase pracheen granth he jin main dhyaan takneekon kaa varnan praapt hota he
 He describes the practices and stages of meditation that existed before Buddha as well as the practices that first developed within Buddhism
 In Hinduism, the word "yoga" first appeared in the Katha Upanishad where it is used in the sense of control of the senses and prevention of mental activity, which has been thought to give the highest status
 mahatvapurn granth jo yoga kii avadharana se sambandhit he ve madhya kaaleen upanishad, mahabharat,bhagavad gita 200 BCE) evam patanjali yoga sutara he
 In Indian philosophy, one of the six philosophies is called Yoga
 yoga darshanik pranali,sankhya skool ke saath nikatataa se sambandhit he
 The Yoga sect, as interpreted by the sage Patanjali, accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is more theistic than the Samkhya gharana, a proof because divine power is also added to the twenty-five elements of Samkhya reality
 yoga or sankhya ek duusare se itane milte-julate he ki mex mullar kehete he,"yah do darshan itane prasiddh the ki ek duusare kaa antar samajhane ke liye ek ko prabhu ke saath or duusare ko prabhu ke bina mana jaataa he

 "hereich Zimmer explains the close relationship between Sankhya and Yoga: in donon ko bharat main judwa ke rup main mana jaataa he, jo ek hi vishay ke do pahalu he
 Sāṅkhya Here is a demonstration of the basic doctrines of human nature, detailed descriptions and defining of its elements, how to cooperate with them in the state of bondage, analysis of their situation at the time of reconciliation or dissociation into liberation
 yoga vishesh rup se prakriya kii gatishiltaa ke suljhaav ke liye upachaar karata he or mukti praapt karne kii vyaavhaarik takneekon ko siddhant karata he athwa 'algaav-ekikaran' kaa upachaar karata he
 Patanjali is widely regarded as the founder of formal yoga philosophy
 patanjali ke yoga, buddhi kaa niyantran ke liye ek pranali he,raaj yoga ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra, which is considered the interpretation formula for his entire work: yoga: chitt-vritti nirodh: - yoga sutara 1
2 This Sanskrit definition rests on the meaning of three Sanskrit words
 ai
ke
taimni isaki anuwaad karte he kii,"yoga buddhi ke sanshodhano kaa nishedh he" 
 The use of the term nirodhaḥ in the early definition of yoga is an example that intellectual technical terminology and concepts play an important role in the Yoga Sutra; This indicates that Patanjali was aware of Buddhist ideas and weaves them into his system
 Swami Vivekananda translates this sutra saying, "yoga blocks the intellect from taking various forms
 patanjali kaa lekhan 'ashtaang yoga" ek pranali ke liye aadhaar ban gaya
 There are eight parts: is sampradaay ke vichaar me, ucchtam prapti vishwa ke anbhavi vividhta ko bhram ke rup me prakat nahin karata
yah duniya vastav he
 Furthermore, the highest attainment is an event where one of the many personalities invents itself, not one universal self that is shared by all individuals
 bhagavad gita, bade paimaane par vibhinn tareekon se yoga shabd kaa upyog karata he
 In addition to an entire chapter devoted to the practice of traditional yoga, including meditation, three major types of yoga are introduced
 madhusoodana saraswati ne gita ko teen virgon main vibhajit kiya he, jahaan pratham chah adhyyon me karm yoga ke bare me, bich ke chah me bhakthi yoga or pichley chah adhyyon me gyana yoga ke bare me gaya he
 Other commentators attribute each chapter to a different 'yoga', where eighteen different yogas are described
 hathyog yoga, yoga kii ek vishesh pranali he jise 15veen sadi ke bharat main hath yoga pradipika ke sankalak, yogi swatmarama dwaara varnit kiya gaya tha
 Hatha Yoga is quite different from Patanjali's Raja Yoga which focuses on sattkarma, the purification of the physical body brings purification of the mind, life and specific energy
 keval patanjali raaj yoga ke dhyaan asana ke badale, yah puure sharir ke lokapriy asana kii charchaa karata he
 Hatha Yoga is a style in many of its modern variations that many people associate with the word "yoga"
 pracheen bauddhik dharm ne dhyanaparaneey avasorana avasthaa ko nigamit kiya
 The earliest ancient manifestations of yoga ideas are found in the early sermons of the Buddha
 buddha ke ek pramukh naveen shikshan yah tha kii dhyanaparaneey avasorana ko paripurna abhyaas se sanyukt kare
 buddha ke upadesh or pracheen brahmanik granthon main prastut antar vicitra he
 According to the Buddha, the meditative state is not the only end, salvation is not attained even in the highest meditative state
 apane vichaar ke purna viraam praapt karne ke bajaay, kisi prakaar kaa maansik sakriyata hona chahie:ek mukti anubhuti, dhyaan jaagrukta ke abhyaas par aadhaarit hona chahie
 The Buddha rejected the ancient cosmic intent to get rid of death
 The Brahminic yogins consider liberation in a non-meditative state where death is experienced
 buddha ne yoga ke nipun kii maut par mukti paane kii puraane brahminic anyokt ko ek nayaa arth diya; unhen, rishi jo jivan main mukt he ke naam se ullekh kiya gaya tha
 Yogakaramahayana is a form of Buddhism
 buddha dharm kii mahayan sampradaay yoga ke saath apni nikatataa ke kaaran vikhyath kiya jaataa he
 In the West, Zen is often arranged with yoga; the two sects of meditation display clear family paradigms
 yah ghatana ko vishesh dhyaan yogya he kyonki kuch yoga prathaon par dhyaan kii zen bauddhik skool aadhaarit he
 Some of the essential elements of yoga are important to Buddhism in general and Zen religion in particular
 yoga tibeti buddha dharm kaa centre he
 In the Nyingma tradition, the path of the practice of meditation is divided into nine yanas, or vahana, it is said to be supremely visible
 antim ke chah ko "yoga yanas" ke rup me varnit kiya jaataa he, yah he:kriya yoga, up yoga, yoga yana, maha yoga, anu yoga or antim abhyaas ati yoga
 sarama paramparaon nemahayog or atiyog kii anuttara varg se sthanapann karte hue kriya yoga, upa or yoga ko shaamil kiya hai
 Other tantra yoga practices include the practice of breath and heart rhythm with 108 bodily postures
 anya tantra yoga prathaon 108 shaareerik mudraon ke saath saans or dil taal kaa abhyaas ko shaamil hai
 This Nyingma tradition also practices Yantra Yoga
 , yah ek anushaasan he jisame saans kaary, dhyanaparaneey manan or sateek gatisheel chaal se anusaran karanevaale kaa dhyaan ko ekagrit karte he
 The body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's Samar temple in Lukhang
 chang dwaara ek arddh tibeti yoga ke lokapriy khate ne kandali apane sharir main garmi kaa utpaadan kaa ullekh karte hue kehete he ki "yah sampurna tibeti yoga kii buniyaad he"
 chang yah bhi daawa karte he ki tibeti yoga praana or man ko sulah karata he, or use tantrism ke saidhantik nihitarth se sambandhit karte he
 According to the Jain text Tattvarthasutra of the second century, mind, speech and body are the total 'sum' of all activities
 umaswami kehete he ki asrav yaa carmik pravaah kaa kaaran yoga he saath hi- samyak charitra arthath yoga niyantran or ant main nirodh mukti ke maarg me behad aavashyak he
 In his Niyamsara, Acharya Kundakunda has described Yoga Bhakti - the path of liberation from devotion - as the highest form of devotion
 acharya haribhadra or acharya hemachandra ke anusaar paanch pramukh ullekh sanyasiyon or 12 samaajik laghu pratigyaaon yoga ke antargat shaamil he
 Because of this view some endolists such as Prof
 Robert J
 Zydenbos said about Jainism that it is essentially a scheme of Yoga thinking that grew into a complete religion
 dow henrich zimmar santusht kiya ki yoga pranali ko purv aryan kaa mul tha, jisane vedon kii satta ko sweekaar nahin kiya or isliye jain dharm ke samaan use ek vidharmik siddhanton ke rup main mana gaya tha Jain scripture depicts the Jain Tirthankaras in the Padmasana or Kayotsarga yoga posture
 aisa kaha gaya he ki mahavir ko mulabandhasana sthiti main baithe kevala gyaan "atmagyaan" praapt hua jo achranga sutara me or baad main kalpasutra me pehali saahitiyik ullekh ke rup me paaya gaya he
 Patanjali is a supernatural analogy in the five Yama or obstacles of Yogasutra and the five major vows of Jainism, indicating a strong influence of Jainism
 lekhak vivian vorthington ne yah sweekaar kiya ki yoga darshan or jain dharm ke bich parsparik prabhaav he or ve likhte he:"yoga puri tarah se jain dharm ko apana rin maanata he or vinimay me jain dharm ne yoga ke saadhnaaon ko apane jivan kaa ek hissaa bana liya"
 The Indus Valley seals and econography also provide a fair evidence that there is a communal resemblance between the Yoga tradition and Jainism
 vishesh rup se, vidwaanon or puratatvavidon ne vibhinn tirthankaron kii muharon main darshai gai yoga or dhyaan mudraon ke bich samaantaaon par tippanee kii he: rishabhdev kii "kayotsarga" mudra or mahavir ke mulabandhasana muharon ke saath dhyaan mudra main pakshon main sarpon kii khudaai parswanath kii khudaai se milti julati he
 All these not only indicate links between Indus Valley Civilization and Jainism, but also demonstrate the contribution of Jainism to various yoga practices
 pracheenatam ke jain dharmavaidhanik sahitya jaise achrangasutra or niyamasra, tattwarthsutra aadi jaise granthon ne saadhaaran vyakti or tapasweeyon ke liye jivan kaa ek maarg ke rup main yoga par kai sandarbh die he
 Later texts, which elaborate on the Jain concept of yoga, are as follows: sufi sangeet ke vikaas main bhartiya yoga abhyaas kaa kaaphi prabhaav he, jahaan ve donon shaareerik mudraon or shwaas niyantran ko anukulit kiya he
 The ancient Indian yoga text, Amritkund, was translated into Arabic and Persian languages in the late 11th century
 san 2008 main malaysia ke sheersh islamic samiti ne kaha jo muslmaan yoga abhyaas karte he unke khilaaf ek fatwa lagu kiya, jo kanoonee taur par gaiyr badhyakaari he, kehete he ki yoga main "hindu aadhyatmik upadeshon" ke tatwon he or is se ish-ninda ho sakati he or isliye yah haraam he
 Muslim yoga teachers in Malaysia criticized the decision as an "insult"
 The women's group in Malaysia also expressed their disappointment and said they would continue their yoga classes
 This fatwa states that yoga practice as a physical exercise is permissible, but prohibits the singing of religious mantras, and also states that teaching such as human union with God is not in line with Islamic philosophy
 isi tarah,ulemus kii parishad, indonesia main ek islamic samiti ne yoga par pratibandh, ek fatve dwaara lagu kiya kyonki isamen "hindu tatv" shaamil the
 But these Fatwas have been criticized by Darul Uloom Deoband, which is the school of Deobandi Islam in India
 san 2009 may main, turki ke nideshaalay ke dharmik maamalon ke mantralay ke pradhan shaasha ali bardaakoglu ne yoga ko ek vyavsaayik udhyam ke rup main ghoshit kiya- yoga ke sambandh main kuch aalochanaye jo islam ke tatwon se mail nahin khaatin
 In 1989, the Vatican declared that Eastern meditation practices such as Zen and Yoga could "degenerate into a faction of the body"
 vatican ke bayaan ke baavjood, kai roman catholic unke aadhyatmik prathaon main yoga, buddha dharm or hindu dharm ke tatwon kaa prayog kiya he
 Tantra is a practice in which the relations of those who follow them bring changes in ordinary, religious, social and logical reality
 tantric abhyaas main ek vyakti vaastaviktaa ko maaya, bhram ke rup main anubhav karata he or yah vyakti ko mukti praapt hota he
 Among the many passages of nirvana offered by Hinduism, this particular passage links tantra to practices of Indian religions such as yoga, meditation, and social renunciation, which are based on temporary or permanent withdrawal from social relationships and methods
 tantric prathaon or adhyayan ke dauraan, chaatr ko dhyaan takanic main, vishesh rup se chakra dhyaan, kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 The way this meditation is known and compared with the methods of Tantric followers and yogis is in a limited form, but is more elaborate than the previous meditation of initiation
 ise ek prakaar kaa kundalini yoga mana jaataa he jiske madhyam se dhyaan or puja ke liye "hriday" main sthit chakra main devi ko sthapit karte he
 By the way, yoga has always been our ancient heritage
 samay ke saath-saath yoga vishwa prakhyat to hua hi he saath hi iske mahatv ko jaanane ke baad aaj yoga logon kii dincharya kaa abhinn ang bhi ban gaya he
 But world-renowned yoga teachers have also contributed to the promotion of yoga, of which the names of Ayyangar Yoga founder BKS Ayyangar and Yogaguru Ramdev are more famous
 ayangar ko vishwa ke agrani yoga guruon main se ek mana jaataa he or unhone yoga ke darshan par kai kitaaben bhi likhi thim, jinamein 'lite on yoga', 'lite on pranayam' or 'lite on da yoga sutraj of patanjali' shaamil hai

 According to research published in the respected journal Nature, this civilization is at least 8000 years old
 yah hadappa sabhyataa or 'sindhu-saraswati sabhyataa' ke naam se bhi jaani jaati he
 It developed along the banks of the Indus and Ghaghghar / Hakra
 mohenjodaro, kalibanga, lothal, dholavira, rakhigadhi or hadappa iske pramukh kendra the
 In December 2014, Bhirdana is considered the oldest discovered city of the Indus Valley Civilization so far
 british kaal main hui khudaayiyon ke aadhaar par puratatvvetta or itihaaskaaron kaa anumaan he ki yah atyant viksit sabhyataa thi or ye shahar anek baar based or ujde hai
 For the first time in the 7th century, when people excavated the soil for eto in the province of Punjab, they found it made from what people believed to be the miracle of God and used it to build a house
 Then in 1826 Charles Massen first made this old Discovered civilization
 kaningham ne 1856 main is sabhyataa ke bare main surveykshan kiya
 During the construction of the railway line from Karachi to Lahore in 1856, the Burton brothers informed the Harappan site to the government

 In 1904, John Marshall was made director general of the Indian Archaeological Department by Lord Curzon
 flit ne is puraani sabhyataa ke bare main ek lekh likhaa
 In 1921 Dayaram Sahni excavated Harappa
 is prakaar is sabhyataa kaa naam hadappa sabhyataa rakhaa gaya va dayaram saahani ko iskaa khojakarta mana gaya
 This civilization was spread in the Indus River Valley, hence it was named Indus Valley Civilization
 pratham baar nagaron ke udai ke kaaran ise pratham nagarikaran bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the use of bronze for the first time, it is also called Bronze Civilization
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke 1400 kendron ko khoja ja sakaa he jisamen se 925 kendra bharat main he
 80 percent of the site is in the vicinity of the Saraswati River and its tributaries
 abhi tak kul khojon main se 3 pratishat sthalon kaa hi utkhanan ho paaya he
 The area of indus Valley Civilization was very wide
 hadappa or mohenjodaro kii khudaai se is sabhyataa ke pramaan mili hai
 Therefore, scholars named it the Indus Valley Civilization, as this area falls in the area of indus and its tributaries, but later the remains of this civilization were also found in areas like Ropar, Lothal, Kalibanga, Vanamali, Rangapur etc
 His tributaries were out of the area
 atah kai itihaaskaar is sabhyataa kaa pramukh kendra hadappa hone ke kaaran is sabhyataa ko "hadappa sabhyataa" naam dena adhik uchit maanate hai
 In 1924 John Marshall, director general of the Archaeological Department, wrote three important texts about the Indus civilization
 is sabhyataa kaa kshetra sansar kii sabhi pracheen sabhyataaon ke kshetra se anek guna bada or vishaal tha
 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh
 tatpashchaat iskaa vistaar dakshin or purv kii disha main hua
 Thus, under Harappan culture, Punjab was not only a part of Sindh and Baluchistan, but also the marginal parts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh
 iskaa failaav uttar main rahamandheri se lekar dakshin main daimabad tak or pashchim main baluchistan ke makraan samudr tat ke sutkagendoor se lekar uttar purv main meerut or kurukshetra tak tha
 In the initial expansion that was received, the entire area was triangular in this way, this area is not only bigger than modern Pakistan, it is bigger than ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
 isa purv teesri or duusari sahastrabdi main sansar bhar main kisi bhi sabhyataa kaa kshetra hadappa samskruti se bada nahin tha
 So far, a total of 1000 sites of this culture have been discovered in the Indian subcontinent
 inamen se kuch aarambhik avasthaa ke hai to kuch paripakv avasthaa ke or kuch uttarvarti avasthaa ke
 There are fewer places with a mature state
 inamen se aadhe darjanon ko hi nagar kii sangya di ja sakati he
 Two of these cities are very important - Harappa of Punjab and Mohne of Sindh
 dono hi sthal vartmaan pakistan main hai
 Both were 483 km away from each other and were connected by the Indus River
 teesraa nagar mohen jo dado se 130 kimi dakshin main chanhudado sthal par tha to chauthaa nagar gujarat ke khambhaat kii khadi ke upar lothal naamak sthal par
 Apart from this, Kalibanga in the northern part of Rajasthan and Banavali in Hisar district of Haryana
 in sabhi sthalon par paripakv tathaa unnat hadappa samskruti ke darshan hote hai
 The mature state of this culture is also seen in the coastal towns of Sutkagandor and Surkotada
 in donon kii visheshta he ek ek nagar durg kaa hona
 The North Harappan stage has also been found at Rangpur and Rosadi sites in the Kathiawar peninsula of Gujarat
 is sabhyataa kii jaankaree sabase pehle 1826 main charles main ko praapt hui
 The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization in three countries are as follows: - bharat ke vibhinn rajyon main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nimna shahar he:- The most special thing about this civilization was the developed city building scheme here
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado dono nagaron ke apane durg the jahaan shaasha varg kaa parivaar rahata tha
 Each town had a lower level city outside the fort where ordinary people lived in brick houses
 in nagar bhawanon ke bare main vishesh baat ye thi ki ye jaal kii tarah vinyast the
 That is, roads used to cut each other at right angles and the city was divided into many rectangular blocks
 ye baat sabhi sindhu bastiyon par lagu hoti thim chaahe ve choti hon yaa badi
 The buildings of Harappa and Mohan Jodaro were large
 vahaan ke smarak is baat ke pramaan hai ki vahaan ke shaasha majdoor jutaney or kar-sangrah main param kushal the
 Seeing the big building of bricks, even the common people will feel how majestic and dignified these rulers were
 mohan jodado kaa ab tak kaa sabase prasiddh sthal he vishaal saarvajanik snanagar, jiskaa jalashay durg ke tile main he
 This is a beautiful example of brick architecture
 yah 11
88 meter lanbaa, 7
01 meter chaudaa or 2
43 meter gaharaa he
 There are stairs to the floor at both ends
 bagal main kapade badalane ke kamare hai
 The bathroom floor is made of burnt bricks
 paas ke kamare main ek bada sa kuna he jiskaa pani nikaal kar hoj main daalaa jaataa tha
 There is an exit in the corner of the Hauz from which water flowed into the drain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki yah vishaal snanagar dharmanushthan sambandhi snaan fke liye bana hoga jo bharat main paaramparik rup se dharmik kaaryon ke liye aavashyak rahaa he
 Mohan Jodaro has the largest structure - the grain storage hall, which is 45
71 meters long and 15
23 meters wide
 hadappa ke durg main chah kothaar mili hai jo eenton ke chabutare par do paanton main khadey hai
 15
23 m each Long and 6
09 m
 Is wide and some one meter from the river bank
 in baarah ikaiyon kaa talakshetra lagbhag 838
125 varg me
 he jo lagbhag utana hi hota he jitna mohan jodado ke kothaar kaa
 There is an open floor to the south of the Harappan cells and two circular rows of brick are built on it
 farsh kii daraaron main gehun or jau ke dane mili hai
 From this it appears that crop was planted on these platforms
 hadappa main do kamaron vaale barrack bhi mili hai jo shaayad mazdooron ke rahane ke liye bane the
 Kalibangan also has brick platforms in the south part of the city which may have been made for the cellars
 is prakaar yah spasht hota he ki kothaar hadappa samskruti ke abhinn ang the
 The use of brick in Harappan culture cities is a special thing, because in the buildings of Egypt at the same time, only dry brick was used in the sun
 samakaleen mesopatamia main pakki eenton kaa prayog miltaa to he par itane bade paimaane par nahin jitna sindhu ghati sabhyataa main
 Mohan Jodaro's drainage system was amazing
 lagbhag har nagar ke har chote yaa bade makaan main praangan or snanagar hota tha
 Many houses in Kalibangan had their own wells
 gharon kaa pani bahakar sadakon tak aata jahaan inke neeche moriyaan bani thim
 Often these peacocks were covered with bricks and stone blocks
 sadakon kii in moriyon main narmokhe bhi bane hote the
 The remains of roads and peacocks have also been found in Banavali
 sindhu sabhyataa kii arthvyavastha krishi pradhan thi, kintu vyapaar ev pashupaalan bhi prachlan main tha
 Indus region was much more fertile in the east than it is today
 isa-purv chauthi sadi main sikandar ke ek itihaaskaar ne kaha tha ki sindh is desh ke upjau kshetron main gina jaataa tha
 In the past, there was a lot of natural vegetation due to which there was good rainfall
 yahaan ke wanon se inte pakaane or imaarat banane ke liye lakdi bade paimaane par istemaal main laai gai jiske kaaran dhire dhire wanon kaa vistaar simatata gaya
 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year
 gaanv kii raksha ke liye khadi paki eent kii diwaar ingit karti he baadh har saal aati thi
 People here used to sow seeds in the flood plains in the month of November after the floods subsided and harvested wheat and barley in April before the next flood
 yahan koi fawda yaa phal to nahin mila he lekin kalibangan kii prak-hadappa sabhyataa ke jo koont mili hai unase abhas hota he ki rajasthan main is kaal main hal jote jate the
 The people of Indus Valley civilization used to produce grains like wheat, barley, mustard, peas, jowar, etc
 ve do kism kii genhu paidaa karte the
 The barley found in Banawali is of an advanced variety
 iske alaava ve til or sarson bhi upjate the
 First cotton was also grown here
 isi ke naam par yunaan ke log is sinden kehane lage
 Harappa was an agrarian culture, but the people here also practiced animal husbandry
 bail-gaay, bhens, bakrii, bhed or boar paala jaataa tha
 The Harappans had knowledge of elephants and rhinoceros
 yahan ke nagaron main anek vyavsaay-dhandhe prachlit the
 These people were very skilled in making pottery
 mitti ke bartanon par kaale rang se bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chitra banaaye jate the
 The cloth making business was in advanced stage
 uskaa videshon main bhi niryaat hota tha
 The jeweler's work was also in advanced stage
 manake or taabeej banane kaa kaary bhi lokapriy tha,abhi tak lohe kii koi vastu nahin mili he
 Hence it is proved that they did not have knowledge of iron
 yahaan ke log aapas main pathar, dhaatu shalk aadi kaa vyapaar karte the
 There is evidence of a large number of seals, uniform script and standardized measurement weights in a large area
 ve chakke se parichit the or sambhawatah aajkal ke ikke jaisaa koi vaahan prayog karte the
 They traded with Afghanistan and Iran
 unhone uttari afghanistan main ek vanijyik upnivesh sthapit kiya jisase unhen vyapaar main sahuuliyat hoti thi
 Many Harappan seals have been found in Mesopotamia, suggesting that they also had a trade relationship with Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia ke abhilekhon main meluha ke saath vyapaar ke pramaan mili hai saath hi do madhyavarti vyapaar kendron kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he - dalmun or maakan
 Dilmun can probably be traced to Bahrain in the Persian Gulf
 itnaa to spasht he ki hadappa kii viksit nagar nirmaan pranali, vishaal saarvajanik snanagaron kaa astitv or videshon se vyapaarik sambandhkisi badi rajnatik satta ke bina nahin hua hoga par iske pukhta pramaan nahin mili hai ki yahaan ke shaasha kaise the or shashan pranali kaa swaroop kya tha
 But looking at the municipal system, it seems that there was a local self-governing body like the Municipal Corporation
 hadappa main paki mitti kii stri murtikaayen baari sankhya main mili hai
 An idol depicts a plant growing out of a woman's womb
 vidwaanon ke mat main yah prithvi devi kii pratimaa he or iskaa nikat sambandh paudhon ke janm or vruddhi se rahaa hoga
 Therefore, it seems that people here considered the earth to be the goddess of fertility and worshiped it in the same way as the Egyptians of Isis, the goddess of the Nile River
 lekin pracheen misr kii tarah yahaan kaa samaaj bhi matra pradhan tha ki nahin yah kahana mushkil he
 Some Vedic hymns praise Prithvi Mata, a well has been found in the fort of Dholavira, it has a staircase leading downwards, and there was a window in it where evidence of lighting a lamp is found
 us kuen main saraswati nadi kaa pani aata tha, to shaayad sindhu ghati ke log us kuen ke jariye saraswati kii puja karte the
 a seal is found in the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, which has a portrait of a yogi with 3 or 4 faces, many scholars believe that this yogi is Shiva
 mewar jo kabhi sindhu ghati sabhyataa kii seemaa main tha vahaan aaj bhi 4 mukh vaale shiv ke avatar eklinganath ji kii puja hoti he
 The people of the Indus Valley Civilization used to burn their dead bodies, cities like Mohan Jodaro and Harappa had a population of around 50 thousand but still only around 100 have been found, which indicates that they burnt the bodies
 lothal, kalibanga aadi jagahon par havan kund mili he jo kii unke vaidic hone kaa pramaan he
 Pictures of Swastik are also found here
 kuch vidwaan maanate he ki hindu dharm dravido kaa mul dharm tha or shiv dravido ke devtaa the jinhen aaryon ne apana liya
 Some Jain and Buddhist scholars also believe that the Indus Valley Civilization was of Jainism or Buddhism, but mainstream historians have denied this and there is not much evidence of this
 pracheen misr or mesopotamia main puratatvavidon ko kai mandiron ke avshesh mili he par sindhu ghati main aaj tak koi mandir nahin mila, marshall aadi kai itihaaskaar maanate he ki sindhu ghati ke log apane gharo main, kheto main yaa nadi kinare puja kiya karte the, par abhi tak keval brihatsnanagar yaa vishaal snanaghar hi ek aisa smarak he jise poojasthal mana gaya he
 Today, as Hindus go to bathe in the Ganges, the Sandhav people used to take a holy bath here
 haan Although the people of this era used many tools and tools of stone, they were well aware of the construction of bronze
 tambe tathaa tin milakar dhaatushilpi kaansya kaa nirmaan karte the
 However, neither mineral was abundant in either
 sooti kapade bhi bune jate the
 People also built boats
 mudra nirmaan, murti kaa nirmaan ke saat baratan bananaa bhi pramukh shilp tha
 Like ancient Mesopotamia, people here also invented the art of writing
 harappai lipi kaa pehla namoona 1853 isvi main mila tha or 1923 main puri lipi prakaash main ai parantu ab tak padhi nahin ja saki he
 Knowledge of the script made accounting of personal property easier
 vyapaar ke liye unhen maap taul kii aavashyaktaa hui or unhonen iskaa prayog bhi kiya
 Many items like weights have been found
 unase pataa chalata he ki taul main 16 yaa uske aavartakon kaa upyog hota tha
 The interesting thing is that till modern times India used to have 1 rupee 16
 1 kilo main 4 pav hote the or har pav main 4 canavaan yani ek kilo main kul 16 canavaan
 This civilization was predominantly 2500 BC From 1800 BC Stayed till aisa abhas hota he ki yah sabhyataa apane antim charan main hrasonmukh thi
 At this time, information about the use of old bricks is available in houses
 iske vinaash ke kaarnon par vidwaan sahamat nahin hai
 Various arguments are given behind the decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as: invasions, climate change and ecological imbalances, floods and geothermal changes, epidemics, economic causes
 aisa lagata he ki is sabhyataa ke patan kaa koi ek kaaran nahin tha balki vibhinn kaarnon ke mail se aisa hua
 Which is likely to happen at different times or together
 mohenjo daro main nagar or jal nikaas ki vyavastha se mahamari ki sambhaavna kam lagati he
 Evidence of severe firefighting has also been obtained
 mohenzodaro ke ek kamare se 14 nar kankal mili he jo akraman, aagjanee, mahamari ke sanket he

 In terrestrial ecosystems, interaction of vegetation, land surface, vados area and ground water are the main attraction points
 jaleey paaritantron main is baat par bal diya jaataa he kis tarah jal rasayan, bhu-akruti vigyaan or jal vigyaan unki sanrachana or kaary ko prabhavit karte hai
 The principles of ecological hydrology are expressed in three sequential components: paristhitiki tantra sevaaon main vruddhi ho
 His expression can be seen as a testable estimate: paristhitik jal vigyaan main ek moulik sankalpana yah he ki paudhe kaa sharir vigyaan sidhe pani kii uplabdhta se judaa hua he
 Where there is sufficient water such as in the rainforest, plant growth depends more on the availability of nutrients

 Since plants depend on this water for important biological processes, soil moisture is an integral part of the study of ecological hydrology
 mitti kii nami ko aam taur par jaleey tatv, θ { \ displaystyle \ theta } yaa santrupti, s { \ displaystyle S} ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 These terms are related to the constancy, n { \ displaystyle n} through the equation θ = n s { \ displaystyle \ theta = ns}

 Ecological hydrological theory also gives importance to topical and spatial relationships

 For example, the Mediterranean landscape has dry summers and rainy winters

 Trees are located farther in soil-less soil ecosystems than in well-watered areas

 Water balance shows that the amount of water entering the soil should be equal to the change in the amount of water coming out of the soil and stored in the soil
 The main four components of water balance are: precipitation penetration into the soil, evaporation, water leakage into the soil depth beyond the reach of plants and water runoff from the surface of the soil
 This is described by the following equation: n z r d s d t = r − i − q − e − l { \ displaystyle nz_{r}{ \ frac {ds}{dt}}=r-i-q-e-l} The total amount of water contained in the core region is indicated on the left side of the equation
 vanaspati ke liye sulabh is pani kii maatra mitti kii sanradhrata n { \ displaystyle n} isaki santrupti se gunan or paudhe ke mul kii gaharaai ke samaan he
 The differential equation ds / dt { \ displaystyle ds / dt} shows how the saturation of the soil changes as time passes
 daayin ore varsha kii dar, avarodhan, apvaah, vaashpan-utsarjan or risaav die gaye hai
 These are given in millimeters per day
 Runoff, evaporation and leakage all depend heavily on the saturation of the soil at a given time

 baad main, nepolian bonapart ne francisi samrajya ke vistaar dwaara kuch ansh tak is kranti ko aage badhaayaa
 As a result of the revolution, the king was removed from the throne, a republic was established, bloody conflicts took place, and finally the dictatorship of Napoleon was established, which spread many values of this revolution in and outside Western Europe
 is kranti ne aadhunik itihaas kii disha badal di
 This led to the decline of the absolute monarchy around the world, new republics and liberal democracies
 aadhunik yug main jin mahaparivartanon ne paashchaatya sabhyataa ko hilaa diya usamen france kii rajyakranti sarvaadhik naatakeey or jatil sabit hui
 This revolution disrupted the life of not only France but the whole of Europe

 This revolution also led to freedom in other European countries and other countries also started fighting for freedom from the monarchy

 France had an autocratic monarchy based on the divine principle of kingship

 In the reign of Louis the 14th, autocracy was at its zenith

 He made laws against his will

 France expanded by diplomacy and military prowess

 The governance that Louis 14th centralized required a worthy king, but his successors Louis 15th and Louis 16th were completely inept

 He had no understanding of the troubles of the common man
 ek baar jab logon kaa juluus roti kii maang kar rahaa tha to usne salaah di ki yadi roti uplabdh nahin he to log kek kyon nahin khate
 In this way the governance system of the country was completely dependent on bureaucracy

 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats

 The law of personal law and the will of the king applied

 Due to this chaotic and complicated law, the public did not have knowledge of their own law

 These oppressive political circumstances gave way to revolution

 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The middle class consisted of moneylender merchants, teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, artists, employees etc
 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society
 france kii aarthik avasthaa sankatagrast thi
 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy

 After his death, Louis 15th participated in the Austrian succession war and the Seven Year War, which further increased the burden on the treasury and eventually Louis 16th made France's economic condition worse by participating in the American War of Independence

 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income

 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy

 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He said that i prefer the rule of one lion in place of hundred mice

 Russo talked about the freedom of man through his book "emily", "social Contract", "rusoni"
 isane kaha ki manushya swatantrat paidaa hote hue bhi sarvatra zanjeeron se jakadaaa hua
 The only way to get rid of these chains is to return to the natural primitive state
 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"
 rajya ke kanoon ko isi saamaanya ichha kii abhivyakti honi chahie lekin kanoon kaa swaroop aisa nahin rah gaya he, balki yah shaasha kii ichha par nirbhar rahane laga he
 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year

 In this, evils of governance, corruption of the church and inequality prevailing in every field were highlighted
 france kii sarkaar ne didaron ko apana ghor shatru mana or uski pustak par anek pratibandh lagaae
 a section of thinkers was focused on the economic disorder and analysis prevailing in France at this time

 The nobles hoped that in this meeting they would be able to obtain the privileges which were taken away at the time of Louis 14th
 madhyavarg ke logon kaa manaan tha ki ve apane paksh main pragatisheel nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran karvaa sakenge
 The farmers hoped that by raising their voice against feudal privileges, they would be able to secure their rights and be free from their exploitation cycle
 is tarah francisi rajtantr kaa samarthan karne ke liye francisi jansankhya kaa koi mahatvapurn bhaag taiyaar nahin tha
 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages
 adhyayan kii suvidha kii drushti se kranti ko nimnlikhit chaar charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he
 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker

 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor

 The entire country was divided into 83 departments by abolishing the ancient provinces

 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians

 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed

 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i

 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
