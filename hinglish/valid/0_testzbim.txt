 labhaansh kisi company ke laabh main bhagidaaron kaa ansh hota he jo vah company laabh kamaane par apane shairdharakon ko detii he
 Dividends in a joint stock company are paid on the basis of fixed value of shares
 is maamle main shairdharak uske share ke anupaat main dividend grahan karata he
 Dividend can be given in money, shares or other forms
 kisi vyapaarik company ke anshadhariyon main laabh ke jis bhaag kaa vibhaajan kiya jaataa he use labhaansh kehete he
 Every trading company has the cumulative right to distribute dividends
 sanchaalak is baat kii sifarish karte hai ki kitni raashi labhaansh ke rup main ghoshit kii jaae
 Thereafter, the company declares a dividend in its general meeting, but this amount should not exceed the amount recommended by the operators
 iske atirikt antarniyamon dwaara adhikrut hone par sanchaalak do saamaanya baithkon ke bich main hi antarim labhaansh kii ghoshnaa bhi kar sakate he
 Generally, dividend is only part of the profit of the company, hence it can be given only by profit and not from capital
 labhaansh ke vishay main anshadhariyon ke saamaanya adhikaron, jaise labhaansh kii dar tathaa purvadhikaar aadi kaa prakathan kabhi kabhi simanim main hi kar diya jaataa he jisase yathasambhav, un adhikaron main parivartan na ho sake
 Sometimes they are disclosed in the articles and sometimes in both the documents
 kis dhang se labhaansh kii ghoshnaa tathaa adaayagi kii jaaegi, iskaa prakathan saadharantaya antarniyamon main hi hota he
 As long as the company is in operation, it is not obliged to distribute the entire profit to the shareholders
 labhaansh vitaran karne ke sthaan par, antarniyamon main isaki vyavastha hone par yah apane laabh ko poonji main parivartit kar sakati he
 The dividend is considered a loan from the day of its declaration and becomes due
 kabhi kabhi antarniyamon main yah bhi praavdhaan hota he ki ghoshnaa ke baad nishchit samay tak labhaansh ke ayaachit rahane par ise jabt kiya ja saktaa he
 Members of the company can request dividends as per the rules of the articles, but it is necessary that the names of such members are recorded in the register of the company on the day of declaration of dividend
 jab anshon kaa hastantaran labhaansh ghoshit karne par uske bahut nikat kis tithi ko ho, to hastantarak tathaa hastantari yah bhi sanvida kar sakate hai ki labhaansh kisko mili
 Dividends are mainly of three types: cash dividend kaa bhugtan check ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Thus the shareholder has to pay tax on the income earned
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan len, to yadi kisi vyakti ke paas 1000 share hai or yadi unka cash dividend mulya 1 rupee hai to use dividend ke rup main 1000 rupee milenge
 In a stock dividend, the company gives more shares in return for the profit the shareholder gets
 is dividand ke udhaaharan swaroop 1000 share rakhane vaale ko paanch pratishat kaa dividend laabh hone par company use paanch atirikt share degi
 The company gives any asset to the shareholder as a dividend earner in the property dividend, but the company rarely gives such dividend
 yah purnataya shairdharak kii ichha par nirbhar karata he ki dividend ke rup main mili hue share ko apane paas rakhe yaa unhen bech de
 There is a fixed date for declaring a dividend, which is announced by the board of directors of the company
 niveshak ke liye dividend laabh kaa sauda hota he kyonki uske dwaara niveshit rakam ke dividend ke rup main mil jane kii guarantee ke kaaran laabh kii sthiti main rahata he
 Investors have high confidence in the stock which gives dividend returns
 niveshak ko milane vaala labhaansh kar-mukt hota he
 Although it varies by individual, interest is taxed
 aisa isaliye hai, kyonki byaaj ko kharch mana jaataa he or labhaansh ko niveshak kaa laabh maanate hai
 If the company has paid tax on its income, including dividends, then it will be double taxed by paying tax on dividends
 isi kaaran se 1997 main labhaansh ko karmukt kar diya gaya tha
 Recently several companies such as Dabur, Financial Technology, Dabur and Crampton Greaves etc
 and PSU SAIL, GAIL, Nalco had announced tax free dividend for their shareholders
 is prakaar kar ke bachaav ke liye labhaansh laabhprad hota he
 There are several reasons for this: privet limited companiyon main mukhya shairdharakon ko adhik labhaansh kaa laabh miltaa he, kyonki isse unke adhik kar kii bachat ho jaati he
 Monetization is the conversion of an item into a valid currency
 pali sahitya main mukhyat: buddha dharm ke sansthaapak bhagavan buddha ke upadeshon kaa sangrah he
 But some part of it was organized or written in Buddha's lifetime, it is difficult to say
 yadhyapi tripitak main hi kuch aise ullekh milte hai jinase buddha ke jeevankaal main hi dharm ke kuch prakarnon ke vyavasthit paath kiye jane kaa pataa chalata he
 For example, there is a description in Udaan that once God himself asked a monk named Sina, how did you understand religion? In response, the monk heard 16 octaves in full voice
 isaki bhagwaan ne prashansa bhi kii
 Vinayapitaka etc
 texts use adjectives such as Bahushruta, Dharmadhar, Vinayadhar, Matrikadhar and Panchannayik, Bhanak, Sutantik, which clearly shows that the tradition of Parana, holding of the teachings of the Buddha, had been in existence since his lifetime
 is parampara ke aadhaar par buddha ke upadeshon ko suvyavasthit saahitiyik rup dene ke liye teen baar sangeetiyaan kii jane ke ullekh chullavagg, dipavansh, mahavansh aadi granthon main milte hai
 The first association took place in the Rajgriha only four months after Buddha-nirvana in which 500 monks participated, due to which he is also famous as Panchashatika
 isaki adhyakshata mahakashyap ne kii or unhone buddha ke saakshaat shishy bhikshu upali se vinay sambandhi tathaa sthavir anand se sutt sambandhi prashn puch-poochkar anya bhikshuon ke anumodan se ukt vishyon kaa sangrah kiya
 The second such type of music took place in Vaishali 100 years after Buddha Nirvana, in which 700 monks joined and that is why she became known as Saptashtika
 isamen vaishali ke bhikshuon ke aacharan main anek dosha dikhaakar unhen vinay ke viruddh tehraaya gaya or anumaanath: vinayapitak main vishesh vyavastha laai gai
 According to Buddhaghosha, by the same association, the Buddha's words were classified into Tripitaka, five bodies, nine limbs and eighty-four thousand religious bodies
 teesri sangeeti buddhanirvana ke 226 varsh pashchaat samrat ashok ke rajyakaal main patliputra main hui
 It was presided over by Moggaliputta Tiss
 yah sammelan nau maas tak chalaa or usamen buddhavachanon ko antim swaroop diya gaya
 In the meantime, Moggaliputta Tissas composed the Kathavatyu in which 18 misconceptions were dispensed with by Buddhist faiths
 is rachana ko bhi abhidhammpitak main sammilit kar liya gaya
 This music is not mentioned in Chullavagga nor in the literature of the Tibetan or Chinese Mahayana sect
 ashok ke bhabru ke lekh, jisamen saat prakarnon ke naam bhi uddhrut hai, usamen, athwa anya dharmalipiyon main aisi kisi sangeeti kaa kahin koi ullekh nahin kiya gaya
 For this reason, scholars such as Keith, Vallesar, etc
 have doubts about its historicity
 kintu riodevids, winternitz tathaa giger aadi vidwaanon ne isaki aitihaasikta sweekaar kii he
 The music, about which the ancient mentions and modern scholars are unanimous about the historicity, is the second musical of Vaishali
 in sangitiyon tathaa anya prayatnon ke falswaroop pali tripitak kaa jo swaroop praapt hua evam jis rup main vah hamen aaj uplabdh he, vah nimna prakaar he : The original Pali literature is divided into three parts, called Pitaka - "vinayapitaka", "sutpitaka" and "abhidhammapitaka"
 inamen se prayek pitak ke bheetar apane apane vishay se sambandh rakhanevaali anek choti badi rachanaaon kaa samavesh he
 These three pitas of Pali compile the thoughts and teachings of Lord Buddha in the pre-sixth century AD in a special style
 teenon pitakon main paraspar taratamya he
 The theme of the theme is Sutpitaka, in which a simple, interesting narrative style is adopted to make the teachings of God heartening to the audience
 yahan vastu ko sankshep main kehane kaa praytn nahin kiya gaya
 The aim is to make new things adaptable to the general audience and that is why the main part of the sermon has been repeated again and again
 prasangvash in sutton main tatkaaleen dharmik, saamaajik evam raajnneetik paristhitiyon kaa chithran bhi aa gaya he jo pracheen itihaas kii drushti se bada mahatvapurn he
 For example, the Buddhist contemporaries of the contemporary religions like Mankhaligosal, Pakudhikayan, Ajit Kes Kambali, Sanjay Balattiputt Niganthanatattu, etc
 and Buddhism of the religious sects promoted by them are found in Buddhist view in the Samphal Sutt, Brahmjala Sutta and Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Dighi Nikaya
 And at the same time, the rendering of Buddhist beliefs on those subjects is also found
 saamaajik chithran suttapitak main bikharaa padaa he, tathaapi khuddak nikaay ke antargat jaatakon main isaki prachur saamagree uplabdh he
 In the Sutas, the kings of the 16 districts of Magadha, Videha, Kosala, Kashi, etc
 of Buddha period are filled with mention of their interrelations and fighting and fights
 sutton ke upadeshon main jis buddha aachaar ke sanket paae jate hai, unheen kii bhikshuon ke yogya sadachaar ke niyamon ke rup main vidhi-nishedh-pranali se vyavastha vinay pitak main bhi kii gai he
 Likewise, the seeds of metaphysics embedded in sutas have been theoretically rendered in philosophical terms and interpreted in Abhidhamma Pitaka
 is paraspar aanushanbikta ke kaaran bauddhadharm kaa puraa sangopang evam suvyavasthit parigyaan bina tripitak ke avlokan ke nahin ho saktaa
 This Pali is based on the teachings of Lord Buddha himself from the point of view of Tripitaka
 uplabdh granth rachana kii drushti se i
 purv tritiy shatabdi se pashchaat kaa siddh nahin hota
 According to the Buddhist tradition, during the time of Ashoka emperor, his son Mahendra himself became a Buddhist monk and took this literature to Lanka and there he got the written form during the reign of King Battagamani in the first century AD which we find today
 tathaapi usamen aisi koi baat hamen nahin milti jo bich kii do teen shatabdiyon ke kaal main lanka kii paristhitiyon ke prabhaav ke kaaran usamen ai kahin ja sake
 The subject of the Vinayapitaka, according to his name, is to present the rules of virtuous morality of monks
 iske teen avaantar vibhaag hai - suttavibhang, khandhak or parivaar
 Suttavibhang again has two subdivisions - Mahavagga and Chullavagga
 is prakaar apane in upavibhaagon kii apeksha vinayapitak paanch bhaagon main vibhakt he
 Sutapitaka is the most important part of Tripitaka in terms of its subject, detail and composition
 isamen aise sutton kaa sangrah kiya gaya he jo paramparanusaar yaa to swayan bhagwaan buddha ke kahe hue hai yaa unke saakshaat shishy dwaara updisht hai or jinka anumodan swayan bhagwaan buddha ne kiya he
 The Sanskrit formulation of Sutta is done
 kintu prastut sutton main sutara ke ve lakshan drushtigochar nahin hote jo sanskrit kii pracheen sutararachanaon, jaise vaidic sahitya ke shrout sutara, gruhm evam dharmasutra aadi main paae jate hai
 The special feature of the sutra is to convey more and more meanings in shortest words
 usamen punarukti kaa sarvatha abhaav avidhyman he
 But here, in contrast to the brief style, the style of elaborate lectures and repeated repetitions of key points has been adopted
 is kaaran sutt kaa sutara roopaantar uchit prathit nahin hota
 By considering, it is inferred that the meaning of the Sutta is originally from Sukta
 vedon ke ek ek prakaran ko bhi sookt hi kaha gaya he
 It is perfectly appropriate to call the rendering of one thing as Sukta
 suttapitak ke paanch bhaag hai jinhen nikaay kaha gaya hai - dighanikaay, majjhimanikaay, sanyuktanikaay, anguttaranikaay or khuddakanikaay
 The longevity is divided into three classes
 pratham silkkhandhavagg main 13 sutt hai, duusare mahavagg main 10 tathaa tisare patikavagg main 11
 Thus there are 34 suttas in longevity
 ye sutt anya nikaayon main sangruhit sutton kii apeksha vistaar main adhik lambey he or yahi is nikaay ke naam kii sarthakata he
 Majjhimnikaya has 152 spans of moderate expansion divided into 15 sections - inamen se 14wein varg vibhang main 12 sutt hai or shesh sab main das-das
 There is a collection of all types of sutas in the Samyutanikayaya and this is the meaning of the name of this body
 isamen kul 56 sutt yaa sanyutt hai jo in paanch virgon main vibhajit hai - Anganwasa body has its own specialty
 isamen sutton kaa sangrah ek vyavastha ke anusaar kiya gaya he
 In the beginning there are such Sutras in which Buddha is a collection of precepts related to a numerical substance of God, followed by Sutras concerning two substances and then three, four etc
 isi kram se is nikaay ke bheetar ekakanipat, dukanipat evam tik, chatuvak, panchak, chakk, sattak, atthak, navak, dasak or ekadask in naamon ke gyaarah nipaton kaa sankalan he
 These drops are divided into reclasses, which are numbered 21, 16, 16, 26, 12, 9, 9, 9, 22 and 3
 is prakaar 11 nipaton main kul virgon kii sankhya 169 he
 There are many sutas within each class whose number is at least 7 and maximum 262 in one class
 is prakaar angutar nikaay se sutton kii sankhya 2308 he
 The Kundak body consists of 15 compositions, completely independent in terms of subject and composition, whose names are - pali tripitak ke tisare bhaag abhidhammpitak main bhagwaan buddha ke darshanatmak vichaaron kaa vishleshan or vargeekaran kiya gaya he tathaa tathvik drushti se unki suchiyaan or paribhaashaayen upasthit kii gai hai
 This Pitaka consists of the following seven texts - dhammsangani uski matika ke anusaar do bhaagon main vibhakt he
 The first part has 22 topics, in each of which three subjects are discussed
 duusare vibhaag main 100 duk hai or prayek duk main vidhaan ore nishedh rup se do do vishyon kaa prarupan kiya gaya he
 These shops are divided into 12 classes, namely - is prakaar dhammsangani ke tikon or dukon kii sankhya 122 he
 The first of these is the skilled, unskilled and uneducated theologian, which is the most important and its theme has been depicted in Chittupapad form Nyakshap and Atthadhar in these four scandals
 vibhang kii vishaywastu 18 vibhaagon main vibhajit he
 There are 216 q & A's within 23 chapters in Kathavatthu which contradict the doctrines of the opposing sects
 puggalpannati main 10 adhyay hai jinamein kramash: ek ek prakaar ke, do do prakaar ke aadi badhate kram main dasven adhyay main 10, 10 prakaar ke pudgalon arthath vyaktiyon kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he
 Individuals have been divided by separation, Samyak Sambuddha, each Buddha, Shayakshi, Ashakshiya, Arya, Anarya etc
 dhatukatha kii rachana kaa muladhar vibhang he, kyonki usee ke pratham teen arthath skandh, aaytan or dhaatu vibhangon kaa hi yahan adhik sookshm vivechan kiya gaya he
 For this reason, the second name of this book is also found in khamb-ayatan-dhatukatha
 granth main inhen teen kaa sambandh dharmon ke saath baitaakar bataaya gaya he
 According to Matik, these religions number 125 which are as follows - inkaa paraspar sambadh prashnottar kii style se 14 adhyyon main kiya gaya he
 Relation of religions in Yamak is explained in a contradictory style with particular subjects, and because of this couple's questionable manner, the Yamak name of this composition is meaningful
 jaise kya sabhi kushaldharm kushalmul hai? kya sabhi kushalmul kushaldharm hai? ityadi
 By this method, an attempt has been made to give a definite explanation of the terminology used in Abhidhammapitaka in Yamak
 yah rachana in 10 yamakon main vibhakt he - The basic ideology of Buddhist metaphysics has been discussed in great detail in a special style in the Puttana
 granth ke mukhya chaar bhaag hai - The relation of the 22 stanzas and the 24 suffixes of the 100 dukas referred to in Dhammasarini in these four parts is explained by the following six pieces: tik pak duk pak shop pik-dik pak-pik-dik pak and shops P
 in chah patthanon kaa purvawat chaar vibhaagon main prarupan hone se sampurna granth 24 patthanon main vibhakt ho jaataa he
 The compilation of the above mentioned Tripitaka literature is often done in BC
 The third century was completed, but the creation of Pali literature continued even after that
 yadhyapi yah anupali sahitya vishay kii drushti se praaia: purnat: tripitak ke antargat gyaan kaa hi anukaran karata he, tathaapi apan swaroop evam style main samay kii gati ke anusaar usamen vikaas dikhaai detaa he
 BC Around the first century, a book called Nettpikaran was written in which the subject of Abhidhammapitaka has been discussed with some more precision
 isamen 16 haar, 5 nay or 18 mul padon ke dwaara buddha darshan kii paribhaashaon ko samajhane kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 The name of its doer is Kachchan
 isi prakaar kii ek duusari rachana isi kaal ke lagbhag kii petkopadesh he jisamen nettiprakaran kii hi vishaywastu ko kuch duusari reeti se upasthit kiya gaya he, jisamen pradhanta un chaar arya satyon kii he jo buddha ke upadeshon ke muladhar hai
 Often, the third composition of this period is milind-panho, which has its specialty in Pali literature and is also very important from historical point of view
 isamen sakal ke naresh milind or bhikshu nagsen se bich hua vaartalap varnit he
 Milind is considered to be a variation of the name of that Yavan Naresh Minadar, who b
c
 In the middle of the second century, India invaded and established its kingdom in the state of Punjab
 prastut granth ke anusaar yah raja bada vidvan or darshanik vishyon main ruchi rakhanevaala tha
 He posed many philosophical questions to the monk Nagasena, to which Nagsen has cleverly answered by affirming his beautiful illustrations
 granth main saat adhyay hai - Of these, the first three chapters are considered to be the original parts of the book
 shesh chaar adhyay peeche jode gaye prathit hote hai
 There are several reasons for this - one is the information about the restart of the book in the third chapter; Secondly, the incarnation of Buddhaghosha is usually taken from only three chapters and thirdly the Chinese translation of this book was done around 400 AD, only these three chapters are found in it
 yah rachana style main badi rochak tathaa buddha siddhant ke gyaan ke liye apane dhang kii adwitiya he
 After these compositions, the era of storytelling begins
 shrut paramparanusaar jab mahendra or sanghmitra dwaara pali tripitak lanka main pahunchaa or bauddhadharm kaa prachar badha, un mul granthon par sinhalai bhashaa main tikaa rup atthakathaayen likhi gai
 These fables are no longer available
 anumaanath: iskaa kaaran un atthakathaon kii rachana ho jane se kramash: un mul atthakathaon kaa adhyayan adhyaapan chhot janaa hi he
 The name of Acharya Buddhaghosha, the author of these new Pali chronicles, is very famous in Pali literature
 unhone jin sinhalai atthakathaon kaa ullekh kiya he tathaa jinke avataran apni atthakathaon main liye hai, unamem mukhya hai- The last four chronicles appear as special lectures on bodies or any of their subjects
 in mul atthakathaon ke abhaav main yah kahana to kathin he ki kitne ansh main buddhaghosh ne unka anukaran kiya or kitna moulik rup se kiya, tathaapi unki rachanaaon ko dekhne se spasht prathit hota he ki unhone mul atthakathaon ko apane tripitak ke vishaal gyaan dwaara bahut hi pallavit kiya hoga
 His chronicles are found on most parts of Vinayapitaka, Sutpitaka and Abhidhammapitaka, numbering 16
 in atthakathaon ke atirikt buddhaghosh kii ek vishisht rachana he visuddhimagg, jise buddha darshan kaa gyaanakosh kaha ja saktaa he
 According to Buddhaghosa himself in the eight stories, he has filled the essence of these four bodies in Visuddhimagga, Digha, Majjhim, Samyutta and Angusad
 shrut paramparanusaar unhone visuddhimagg ko apni atthakathaon se purv unki rachana ko apni yogyata siddh karne ke liye hi likhaa tha
 There are a total of 23 passages in this book
 pratham do parichchhedon kaa vishay he "samadhi" or shesh parichchhedon main "pragna" kaa vyaakhyaan kiya gaya he
 After Buddhaghosha, the tradition of storytelling was reaffirmed by his two contemporary scholars, Buddhadutt and Dhammapala
 buddhadutt ne buddhaghosh krit samantapasadika naamak vinayapitak kii atthkatha kaa saar apni uttaravinishchay or vinayavinishchay naamak do padyatmak rachanaaon main upasthit kiya tathaa buddhaghosh kii abhidhamm kii atthakathaon ke aadhaar par abhidhammavatar naamak gadhy-padya-mishrit granth kii rachana kii
 The originality in this is that where Buddhaghosha has discussed religions through the five wings of Rupa, Vedanadi, Buddhadatta has adopted this four types of classification as Chittar, Chetasik, Rupa and Nirvana
 isi vargeekaran ko unhone apni rooparoop vibhaag naamak rachana main rakhaa he
 Another creation of Buddhadutt is Madhurutha Vilasini, a story of Buddhavans
 dhammpal ne saat atthakathaayen likhi he
 Buddhaghosha did not write anecdotes on the texts named Uddan, Itishutakat, Vimanavatthu, Petavatthu, Theragatha, Therigatha and Chariapitaka under Khuddakanikaya, on which Dhammapala has written a story called Paramatthadipani
 isi prakaar nettiprakaran par atthasanvaneena or usee par linatthavannana naamak tikaa, visuddhimagg par paramatthamanjusha, buddhaghosh kii chaar nikaayon kii atthakathaon par leenatthapakasini naamak tikaa, jatakatthakatha kii tikaa tathaa buddhadutt krit madhuratthvilasini kii tikaa likhi
 The most famous of these works is his commentary
 shesh rachanaaon main koi vaishishty nahin he
 Although the above is not after the creation of Tripitaka and his stories
 yadhyapi ukt tripitak va unki atthakathaon kii rachana ke pashchaat buddhavachan ke sambandh main adhik kuch kahana shesh nahin rahaa, tathaapi is atthkatha naamak tikaa sahitya kii rachana buddhaghosh yug main baraabar hoti rahi
 Some of these compositions are as follows: anandakrit abhidhamm mul tikaa, chulldhammpal krit 'sachch sankshep', upsen krit saddhammppajotik mahanam krit sadshammppakasini, kassap krit mahvichedni or vimatichhedni, vajrabuddhi krit sammtavpasadika kii tikaa, kshem krit khemppkaran, aniruddh krit abhidhammaththsangaho paramatthavinishchay or namrupapariched, dharmashri krit khuddakasikkha or mahaswami krit mulsikkha
 From 12th century onwards, the creation of commentaries started in Magadhi language itself
 is kaary kii suvyavastha ke liye lanka naresh parakrambahu pratham ke kaal main sinhalai sthavir mahakssap dwaara ek sangeeti kii gai, jiske falswaroop samantapasadika aadi atthakathaon par deepani, manjusa, pakasini aadi naamon se aath tikaayen likhi gayi, jinamein se ab keval vinayapitak kii samantapasadika atthkatha par likhi gai saratthdipani tikaa maatr milti he
 Three other commentaries of its subject Sariputta are also found
 sumangala, saddhammajotipal, dhammakirti, buddharavikhat or meghankar - in sabhi ne bhinn-bhinn atthakathaon par tikaayen likhi he
 In these, ten commentary texts like the original Sikha Tika of Wachissar Ther alone are found
 13veen shatee main sthavir videh, buddhapriy or dharmakirti dwaara samantakutavannana aadi anek granthon kii rachana hui
 Four poetic texts are famous among the works of the 14th century - baad kii teen rachanaaon ke kartaaon ke naam agyaat hai
 After the 14th century, the field of Pali-literature-creation rose from Lanka and reached Brahmadesh
 yahan ke sahityakaron ne abhidhamm ko vishesh rup se adhyayan kaa vishay banaaya
 Some compositions of the 15th century are 16veen shatee main saddhammalankar ne patthan prakaran par patthandipani naamak tikaa likhi tathaa mahanam se anandakrit abhidhamm-mul-tikaa par madhusaaraty dipani naamak anutika likhi
 In the 17th century, Tripitakalankar composed the three texts on the eightyasalini, Visastivanna, the commentary on the Sariputitika Vinayasagraha called Vinayalankara and Yasavaddhanavatthu
 trilokguru ne chaar granth rache- The other two compositions of this Shati are the Dhatukthayajana by Saradassi and Abhidhammatthaganthipada by Mahakasap
 18veen shatee kii gnanamivanshnamak brahmdes ke sangharaaj kii teen rachanaayen prasiddh hai- Some of the creations of the 19th century Brahmadesh- Nalatdhatu Vans, Sandes Katha Boundedism, decision etc
 is shatee ke chhakesadhatuvans, gandhavans or sasanavans naamak rachanaaon kaa parichay vans sahitya ke antargat diya gaya he
 Other notable works of this century are the monk Ledisdav's Abhidhammamsarah's Paratthadipani Tika and the Pali essay on Yamak which he wrote to address some of Mrs Raise Davids's doubts
 pali-sahitya-rachana kii avichhinn dhara ke pramanswaroop 20veen shatee kii do rachanaaon kaa ullekh karnaa anuchit na hoga
 These are Visuddhimagdipika composed by Bhandat Dharmanand Kosambi and Navneet Tika of Abhidhammatthasangra in India
 is parichay ke aadhaar se kaha ja saktaa he ki paalisahitya-nirmaan kii dhara dhai hajaar varsh ke pashchaat bhi abhi tak vicchhinn nahin hui
 At the time when Tripitaka was being composed in Sri Lanka, historical interest in some of the writers was aroused at the same time, resulting in the creation of Deepavansha
 in granthon main lanka kaa itihaas, pracheenatam kaal se lekar raja mahasen ke rajyakaal tak, varnan kiya gaya he
 This work has been used by Buddhaghosha abundantly in his books and has also given its revision in some places
 is prakaar dipawans kaa rachanakaal i
 chauthi paanchavin shatee ke bich siddh hota he
 Along with the kings of Sinhala, the details of the life of Buddha, the tradition of his disciples and all the three musicians etc
 have been exaggerated
 anumaanath: iske vishay kaa aadhaar uparyukt sinhalai atthakathaayen rahi hai
 This composition is poly-prose-mixed, the style is very relaxed, the repetitions are also many and the composition is not free from defects of language, verses etc
 ye lakshan uski pracheenta ke dyotak hai or is baat ke pramaan hai ki usamen vishaywastu anek sroton se sankalit kii gai he tathaa usamen sampadakeey vyavastha laane kaa koi vishesh praytn nahin kiya gaya
 But historically in Lanka, it has a great respect from the beginning
 kaha jaataa he ki i
 5veen shatee main hi sinhal raja dhatusen ne ek varshikotsav ke avasar par rashtriya gaurav ke saath iskaa paath karaayaa
 Deepavans is naturally the oldest work in Indian historical works
 dipavansh kii rachana se kuch kaal pashchaat mahanam ke dwaara mahavansh kii rachana hui
 Its base is also the Sinhala story and the deep dynasty
 yahan vishay kaa pratipaadan dipavansh kii apeksha adhik vishad or vyavasthit he
 Language is also more refined and the style reminds us of the method of epics somewhere
 mahavansh kaa mul bhaag 37 parichchhedon kaa he or vah dipavansh ke samaan mahasen ke shasankaal par samaapt hota he
 The earliest passages, which mention the religious conditions of the country before the arrival of Buddhism in Lanka, are historically significant
 udaahranarth, pandaskamay naresh kaa rajyakaal mahendra dwaara lanka main bauddhadharm ke pravesh se 60 varsh purv tak rahaa kaha gaya he
 This king ruled for 70 years and established the city of Anuradhapura only in the 10th year of the state
 isse aage is rachana main samay-samay par parivardhan kiya gaya he
 From the 50th saga of the 37th passage to the 79th passage, the composition is Sthir Dharmakirti and gives the lineage of 78 kings from the time of Mahasena to Parakramabahu I
 mahavansh kaa yah tathaa isse aage ke pariched chulvansh kehalaata he
 The Buddhist monk, the author of 11 passages from Chulvansh 80 to 90, described the next 23 kings who came to Parakramabahu IV
 91 se 100 tak ke 10 pariched sumangala ther dwaara rache gaye or unamem bhuvnekbahu tritiy se lekar kirtishree rajsingh ke kaal tak ke 24 raajaaon kaa varnan kiya
 The propagation of Christianity in Lanka is also reported here
 aglaa 101vaan pariched sumangalacharya tathaa devarakshit dwaara rachaa gaya
 Thereafter, there is also information about the state going into the hands of the British
 mahavansh kaa antim parivadharn bhikshu pragyanand nayak dwaara 1936 main prakashit hua or isamen 1815 se 1935 i
 tak kaa lanka kaa itihaas samavisht kiya gaya he
 Thus the composition of the Mahavansha has the hand of six authors by whom the history of Lanka from Lord Buddha to about two and a half thousand years has been inscribed unceasingly
 yah granth is baat kaa bhi pratik he ki ukt deergh kaal tak lanka main pali bhashaa ko kis prakaar jivit rakhaa gaya or usamen saahitiyik rachana kii dhara ko kabhi sookhne nahin diya gaya
 Deep Vansh and Mahavansha creations awakened intense historical instincts
 parinamat: anek anya vansh naamak granth rache gaye
 Historical facts are often taken from both the above mentioned texts, but the tradition of the various themes which have been collected in them is important
 inamen vishay ko mahatv dene ke liye bahut kuch atishyoktiyon or kalpanaaon kaa bhi aashray liya gaya he, jiske kaaran kahin kahin itihasajna ko udvaig yaa ashraddha utpann hone lagati he
 The main compositions of this type are - ukt granthon main adhikansh bhaag pracheen tripitak, unki atthakathaon tathaa mahavansh ke antargat vaarta kii sakshep yaa vistaar se punrariti maatr he
 But still they have some originality of their own subject, on the basis of which we get some history of the above mentioned subjects from the Buddha period till now
 yah pali sahitya kii apni visheshta he jo sanskrit praakrit main nahin pai jaati
 Classical texts have also been composed in Pali from time to time
 vyakaran ke kshetra main kacchan or moggallan krit, vyakaran evam unki tikaayen prasiddh hai
 In 1154 AD, there is a grammar of Pali language based on the grammar of Kachchan, Saddaniti, monk of Brahmadesh
 iske teen bhaag hai- padmala, dhatumala or suttamala
 Based on this, there is a rhymed metallist called Dhatvarthadeepani, a Jinratna monk pali vyakaran vishyak anya kuch rachanaayen hai- saddhammaguru krit saddabutti, mangalakrut gandhatthee or samner dhammadassi krit vachhvachak, arievansh krit gandhabharan, brahmadesh ke narsh kychha kii putree krit vibhaktyarthprakaran, jambudhvaj krit sanvaneenanay-dipana or niruttisangah, raajaguru krit karkpupfamanjari 
 The "abhidhanappadipika" and "ekkkara Kosh" of the Pali are well-known books
 pali chand:shaastra par bhi anek rachanaayen hai, jaise vrittoday, chandovichiti or kavibharprakaran aadi
 Among them, the most famous is the Thar Sangharvikrita
 isapar vachanatvajotika naamak tikaa bhi likhi gai
 The only work on these poetic poems is the same composition - Subodhalankar
 shabdkosh : Text: pali adhyayan : Discussion Group: pali saftware evam upkaran : Shankhadrao is the medicine of Ayurveda
 chunki is druv avasthaa vaali aushadhi main shankh, kaudi, pravaal or mukta jaise dravyon ko mila dennen se ukt dravya gal jaate hai, is kaaran ise shakhadrav kehete hai
 Kaimur, a subdivision of Bihar
 kalisto hamaare saura mandal ke paanchave grah brihaspati kaa doosraa sab se bada upgrah he or yah puure saura mandal kaa teesraa sab se bada chandramaa he 
 It is about 4,820 km in diameter, which is 99% of the planet Mercury, but due to the density of Mercury it is only one-third of that of Mercury

 Kalisto was a kind of nymph in ancient Greek religious stories

 But the orbit of the Kalisto revolving around Jupiter is such that the radiation on the Kalisto is less
 isliye vaigyanik maanate hai ke bhavishya main yadi maanav bahari saura mandal main failenge to kalisto unke liye ek mahatvapurn adda ho saktaa he
 Kalisto has a very thin atmosphere that contains mostly carbon dioxide and a very small amount of molecular oxygen

 ashtaang yoga, ko aath alag-alag charnon vaala maarg nahin samajhnaa chahie; yah aath ayaamon vaala maarg he jisamen aathon ayaamon kaa abhyaas ek saath kiya jaataa he
 These eight parts of yoga are: 1) yama, 2) niyam, 3) asana, 4) pranayam, 5) pratyaahaar, 6) dharna 7) dhyaan 8) samadhi According to Ashtanga Yoga Maharshi Patanjali, the name of prevention of Chittavruti is Yoga

 bahirang sadhana yatharth rup se anushthit hone par hi sadhak ko antarang sadhana kaa adhikaar praapt hota he
 'yama' and 'niyam' are actually indicative of modesty and penance

 The name of the initial state of this effort is dharna

 Meditation is the condition ahead of it
 jab us deshavishesh main dhyey vastu kaa gyaan ekaakaar rup se pravaahit hota he, tab use 'dhyaan' kehete hai
 In both the perception and meditative conditions, the instinct is present, but the difference is that in the perception one instincts arises against the instinct, but in meditation there is only a flow of eloquence, not a distortion

 chini mitti ek prakaar kii safed or sughaty mitti hai, jo prakritik avasthaa main pai jaati he
 Its chemical composition is aqueous alumino-silicate
 chini mitti ko 'keolin' bhi kehete hai
 In Chinese, kaolin means 'hill danda'
 dande bahudhaa felsapaar khanij ke hote hai or is felsapaar kaa rasinic vighatan hone ke kaaran china mitti yaa keolin inhen daandon main pai jaati he, balki us safed or sughaty mitti ko bhi kehete hai jo vighatan ke sthaan se bahakar kisi anya sthaan main jamaa ho jaati he
 Therefore, there are two types of ceramic: chini mitti kaa upyog bartan, pyaale, katori, thali, aspataal main kaam main laae janevaale saamaan, bijli ke pruthakkari, motargadiyon ke spark plag, taapasah iten ityadi banane main hota he
 Ceramics are used as a filler in rubber, textiles and paper making
 kabhi kabhi ise dawa ke rup main bhi khilaate hai
 Kaolin is given in cholera etc
 disease
 bharat main chini mitti bihar kii rajmahal pahadiyon or pathargatta naamak sthaan ke paas, dilli ke aasapaas kii pahadiyon main tathaa kerala main trivendrum ke paas kundara naamak sthaan main acchhee or prachur maatra main milti he
 In many places in Rajasthan, ceramic soil is found in abundance in Madhya Pradesh, Bombay, Gujarat, Chennai, Bengal and Andhra Pradesh too
 assam or punjab main bhi chini mitti prachur maatra main pai jane kii sambhaavna he
 To be useful in pottery industry, ceramic should also have some other properties like, in gunon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue uparyukt do prakaar kii chini mitti kaa aage or bhi vargeekaran kiya ja saktaa he, jaise: 1
 The sugar, the clay that remains white when cooked in a fire, and the clay that does not remain white when cooked in a fire; 2

 vishesh prakaar ke gunonvali mitti hi vishesh prakaar ke udyog main adhik upyogi siddh hoti he, jaise unche taap ko sah sakanevaali mitti kaa upyog taapasah iton ke banane main hota he
 Beautiful and reddish clay is more useful when cooked for making houses etc
 pyaale, katori ityadi banane main aag main pakaane par safed rahanevaali mitti ko hi log adhik pasand karte hai
 In the textile, paper or rubber making industry, there is a high demand for very small clay white clay
 upyog main laane ke pehle chini mitti ko apdravyon se mukt karnaa padataa he
 This action is done by 'washing' the ceramic with water
 iske liye chini mitti ko pani main milakar naaliyon main bahaya jaataa he
 The effluents are heavy and sit down and the ceramic is washed away with water
 kuch dur bahane ke baad is chini-mitti-yukt pani ko ek tank main jamaa kar liya jaataa he
 After some time, the ceramic also settles down in the water
 upar kaa pani nikaal liya jaataa he or mitti sukha lee jaati he

 saar lekhan main kisi vistrut vishay-vastu yaa ansh ke mul bhaavon ko ki kam-se-kam shabdon or vaakyon main likhaa jaataa he
 Abstract writing is required in many fields like office, commerce, journalism, education etc
 kisi saamagree kaa saar likhnaa ek upyogi kala he, jiskaa hamaare jivan main bahut mahatva he
 When the curd is stirred with mustard, its element part comes up
 yahi pruthak karne par makkhan kehalaata he
 This is called the essence of butter curd
 jis prakaar jami hui dahi ko mathkar makkhan nikaala jaataa he, usee prakaar chintan kii prakriya se math kar kisi bhi saamagree main se saar nikaala jaataa he
 This is also the essence in terms of language
 a In order to make his talk effective and interesting and to make it understandable to the readers, the writer makes his point, uses idioms and proverbs, authenticates it with a story
 vidwaanon kii uktiyon ko udhrut karke use thos banaata he, alankaar-yukt shabdaawalee kaa prayog karata he or kathy ko vistaar detaa he
 The content of a text can also be distinguished between abstract and abstract matter
 jo baaten mahatva kii hoti hai, unhen ham sweekaar karalete hai or shesh ko chhod dete hai
 Today's life is very run-of-the-mill
 logon ke paas samay kii kami he
 The world is moving so fast that if a person does not move step by step with him, he will fall behind
 yahi kaaran he ki vyakti kam-se-kam samay main adhik-se-adhik baaten jaan lenaa chahta he
 Officers in the office do not have enough time to read the files and letters completely
 ve kam-se-kam samay main adhik-se-adhik filon or patron ko nipta dena chaahate hai
 Especially the officer who has recently taken over
 us vyakti ke paas itnaa samay nahin hota ki vah sabhi filein vistaar se padhe, atah vah sambandhit file kii saamagree kaa saar prastut karne kaa aadesh de detaa he
 Essence proves to be very helpful in such situations
 saar ko padhakar adhikari turat-phurat dher sari filein nipta detaa he
 By reading the summary, a person chooses a news, article or story of his interest
 kul milakar ’saar‘ puri saamagree ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya vah masauda he, jo sankshipt hote hue bhi saamagree kii sabhi mukhya baton ko apane main samete hota he, jiske aadhaar par puri saamagree ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Here the question may arise that when abstracting is of such importance and all works can run on the basis of essence, then what is the need and importance of original material, that is why the original detailed material is read then? Going further than this, why don't everyone write abstracts, why write their things in detail? vastutah kathy kii samvedansheeltaa, bhashaa kaa chamatkaar, anubhav kii ooshmaa, saar main nahin aa paati
 The essence works, but it lacks creativity
 atah kathy ko puri tarah jaanane or samajhane ke liye, bhashaa ke chamatkaar kaa anand lene keliye or saamagree kii rachanaatmakataa se vibhor hone ke liye mul saamagree kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Although we should say our words in short and concise words and avoid nonsense, but the essence is not useful to express the emotions fully and express it in an effective style
 atah saar mul saamagree kaa sthaan nahile saktaa
 Sometimes original material is read for the information of a fact
 aksar ham dahi ko mathkar makkhan nikaal lete hai or matthey kaa kisi or kaary main upyog karte hai
 In the same way when we want to get the essence of a material, our brain acts as a churner
 ham padhakar yaa sunakar kisisaamagree ko mastishk main pahunchaate hai or hamaara mastishk us mul saamagree ke vistaar ko alag karke saar prastut kar detaa he
 In order to clarify the motif and make it effective, the writer or person takes many measures, such as to clarify the sentiment
 or bhav ko prabhavi banane ke liye vah- In order to clarify his feeling a person interprets it in many ways
 aise udhaaharan detaa he, jisase bhav spasht ho sake
 He also repeats the sentiment one or more times when needed
 apane bhav ko prabhaavapurn banane ke liye vyakti muhaavarey, lokoktiyon kaa prayog karata he, alankarpurn bhashaa kaa vyavhaar karata he
 Uses folk-famous or related stories and jokes etc
, mentions the utterances of famous litterateurs, politicians etc
 and constructs the genre by dealing with dialogue etc
 saar lekhan kii prakriya ke nimnlikhit charan hai: 1
 Realization of original material 2
 mulbhaav kii pahchaan 3
 Identification of related expressions 4
 mulbhaav ko spasht karne vaali vyakhya, udhaaharan or doharaav kii pahchaan 5
 Identification of elements that make the motif effective, ie, stories, ornaments, famous statements and creative and Vyasa style
 6
 mul bhav ko spasht karne ke liye vistaar dene vaale vaakyon ko hataate hue saar lekhan
 First of all, we read the original material once, twice or more and understand it and find out what has been said in it
 ise padhane or samajhane ke dauraan ham jaan lete hai ki saamagree kaa mulbhaav kya he or usase sambandhit anya bhav koun se hai
 First of all it is important to know that there is a difference between the abbreviation and the essence of a passage
 sankshepan kisi di hui saamagree kaa sankshipt athwa chota rup hota he parantu saar, sankshepan se or bhi adhik chota hota he
 Both abstract and summary words are used in one form
 praayah mul avataran se sankshepan ek-tihaai hota he
 For this, you should count all the words and divide them into three and the number of words should be written in your language as the central sense of descent
 avataran ke mul bhav ko jivit rakhte hue shabdon ko kam karnaa bhi ek kala he
 It has two methods: 1
 tyaag vidhi 2
 Change method iske antargat shabdon ko chhodana hota he arthath jo shabd kaam ke nahin hai, jinhen hataa dene par bhi arth main koi parivartan nahin aata, use tyaag vidhi kehete hai
 The author's address, address etc
 are not written in it
 kisi baat ko yadi udhaaharan aadi dekar samajhaayaa gaya he to unhen chhod diya jaataa he
 Only the original message is taken
 lokokti, alankaar aadi kaa prayog bhi tyaag diya jaataa he
 The sentences are written by narrowing
 anek shabdon ke liye ek shabd se kaam chalaaya jaataa he
 The language requires agility and tightness, making summarization simple, natural, beautiful and effective
 in baton kaa karyaalay main patron, tippaniyon, reporton aadi ko sankshep main likhte samay bhi dhyaan rakhana aavashyak hota he
 In this method, it is necessary to make some changes by not removing the language of the original passage, as words can be reduced by using sandhi and samas
 udhaaharan ke liye ’pilaa vastra pahanane vaale krishna bhagwaan‘ ke liye ham keval ’pitambar‘ shabd kaa prayog kar sakate hai yaa phir ’raja kaa putr‘ ke liye maatr ’raajputr‘ kah sakate hai
 Similarly, sentences can be shortened by using one word for several words
 jaise ’jo ishwar ko na maanata ho‘ use ’naastik‘ shabd kahkar kaam chalaaya ja saktaa he yaa phir jis par mukadmaa chal rahaa ho vah ’abhiyukt‘ kehalaata he
 'good conduct', 'virtuous' and 'what can be read', 'readable' etc
 patron, tippaniyon or reporton kaa saar taiyaar karne main atyadhik saavdhaanee kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The first letter or note should be read carefully
 yadi ek baar padhane se baat spasht na ho to use do baar-teen baar padhanaa chahie, kyonki yadi patr main di gai baaten thikse samaj na aaen to saar main galati ho sakati he
 Letters refer to government rules, orders or pre-letters, so it is important that the content is properly looked at before making its abstract, only then the abstract can become fine and useful
 file ke do bhaag hote hai- patrachaar bhaag or tippanee bhaag
 In the correspondence part, letters related to the case are kept and in the noting part there are comments related to the case
 ye tippaniyan aise likhi jaati hai ki inamen purv-tippaniyon kaa saar ho jinhen padhe bina hi aage tippan likhaa ja sake
 Every matter of office is dealt with the help of comments, therefore great care is required in noting
 agar tippan lekhan main choti-si chook ho jaae to karrwai kii puri disha hi badal sakati he
 Things to keep in mind while writing abstracts: 1
 ek, do yaa adhik baar padhakar mul saamagree ko samajhnaa
 2
 Underline the repetition of interpretations, examples and expressions in the material
 3
 mulbhaav ko alag kagaz par likhnaa
 4
 Write abstracts in about one-third the size of the original material in descriptive other male style based on the motif and its related expressions
 5
 aavashyak hone par mul bhav ke aadhaar par saar sankshepan kaa sheershak likhnaa
 6
 Read the written abstract and see if there is any main thing in it
 7
 aavashyak hone par saar kaa sampadan karnaa
 Editing means adding something that is missing from the main thing in the abstract
 yadi usamen koi doharaav he to use hataanaa or bhashaa-style ko upyukt va chust bananaa
 Sorting the title of a certain paragraph is also an art
 sheershak sadaiv saamagree par aadhaarit or uske kendriya bhav se judaa hua hona chahie
 If the title becomes clear even before writing the abstract, then there is a lot of convenience in putting ideas on paper in abstract form
 sheershak kaa chunaav karnaa kisi chiz ko jaise kaa taisa rat lene vaala kaary nahin he balki iskaa prayog chaturaai ke saath karnaa chahie
 It is a type of skill that can be developed through continuous practice
 kahawat he ki ’’karat-karat abhyaas kejadmati hot sujan‘‘isi se kala main nikhaar aata he
 To choose the title, you should read the passage two or three times and consider its central sense
 kabhi-kabhi yah kendriya bhav avataran ke shuru main hi mil jaataa he
 But there is no strict rule
 kabhi-kabhi yah avataran ke madhya main athwa ant main bhi ho saktaa he
 The title should always be catchy and interesting as well as appropriate in which the fact or intent of the entire content is clear
 ek baar sheershak padhakar pathak yah andaaz laga le ki anuchhed main kya hoga saath hi sheershak main itnaa adhik aakarshan hoki vah pathak ko saamagree padhane par majboor kar de
 The same article may have one or more titles
 praayah sheershak ek shabyathwa ek padbandh kaa hi hota he
 Most compound method is used to give the title
 kabhi koi sookhti yaa vaakya bhi upyukt sheershak ho saktaa he
 After reading the article several times after understanding it, the more appropriate it suits your mind
 usee ko sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 After finding the title of an abstract appropriate, the examiner experiences the need to read the abstract
 atah sheershak bahut soch-vichaar kar hi chunanaa chahie
 This is the test of your intelligence

 On the Samadhi Samvat of Shri Baba Ramdev ji, 1442, Ramdev greeted all the elders by taking the shrimp with his hand, and after offering a letter, everyone worshiped Ramdev with his heart, heart and reverence
 ramdev ji ne samadhi main khadey hokar sab ke prati apane antim upadesh dete hue kaha 'prati maah kii shukla paksh kii dooj ko puja paath, bhajan kirthan karke parvotsav manaanaa, raatri jaagran karnaa

 Shri Ramdev ji was born on Bhadwa Sudi Pancham on Vikram Samvat 1409 in Undu Kashmeer village of Shiv Tehsil of Barmer district on Monday, which is evidenced by the testimony of Shri Ramdev Ji to Shrimukh, which is written in Samvat Chaturdash Sal Navam Chait Sudi Pancham You come to Shri Mama Bhai Raja Ramdev Chait Sudi v to Ajmal's house which is written by King Ajmal himself with his own hands on the books of Tuvnar dynasty
 Or went which is attested and is also attested in twenty four proofs by Sri Ramdev, written by Gokuldas Aman Ghatoda santaan hi mata-pita ke jivan kaa sukh he
 King Ajmal ji used to do charity for the attainment of his son, saints would give food to saints, offer sacrifices, and worship Dwarkanath regularly
 is prakaar raja ajmal ji bhairav rakshas ko maarane kaa upaay sochate hue dwarka ji pahunche
 Where Ajmal ji had visions of God, seeing the tears in the eyes of the king and wiping tears from his father in the Lord, he said, o Bhaktaraj, don't cry, i know all your sorrows
 main teri bhakthi dekhakar bahut prasann hoon, maango kya chaiye tumhen main teri har ichchhaayein purna karunga
 Pleased with the infinite grace of God, Lord said if you are happy with my devotion, i want a son like you, that is, you have to come to my house as a son and kill the demon and establish religion
 tab bhagwaan dwarkanath ne kaha- he bhakt! jaao main tumhe vachan detaa hoon ki pehle tere putr viramdev hoga tab ajmal ji bole he bhagwaan ek putr kaa kya chota or kya bada to bhagwaan ne kaha- doosraa main swayan aapke ghar aaunga
 Ajmal ji said, o Lord, when you come to my house, what will we know that God has come to visit me, then Dwarkanath said that the night i come home, all the temples in your state will ring the bells in it, palace Whatever water i have in it will turn into milk and Kumkum's feet will be seen from the main gate to the place of birth, i will also hear my Akashvani and i will become famous by the name of Avatar

 At that time, bells started ringing in all the temples, the whole city shone with bright light
 mahal main jitna bhi pani tha vah doodh main badal gaya, mahal ke mukhya dwaar se lekar paalane tak kumkum ke pairon ke padchinh ban gaye, mahal ke mandir main rakhaa sankh swat: baj uthaa
 At the same time, King Ajmal Ji remembered the words given by Lord Dwarkanath and once again said the words of Dwarkanath
 is prakaar ne dwarkanath ne raja ajmal ji ke ghar avatar liya
 Mother lust in Bal Leela bhagwaan nen janm lekar apni bal lila shuru kii
 One day Lord Ramdev and Viramdev were playing on their mother's lap, Mata Maenade was looking at the form of those two boys
 praat:kaal kaa manohari drishy or bhi sundarata badha rahaa tha
 On the other hand, the maid brought out the milk of the cow and while giving utensils in the hands of Mata Maenade, the sportsmanship of these children was roasted
 mata baalkon ko doodh pilaane ke liye doodh ko chuulhe par chadhaane ke liye jaati he
 As soon as the mother puts milk in the vessel, she offers it to the stove
 udhar ramdev ji apni mata ko chamatkaar dikhaane ke liye viramdev ji ke gaal par chumati bharte hai isse viramdev ko krodh aa jaataa he tathaa viramdev badale kii bhaavana se ramdev ji ko dhakka maar dete hai
 Due to which Ramdev ji falls and starts crying
 ramdev ji ke rone kii aawaaj sunakar mata manade doodh ko chulhe par hi chhodkar aati he or ramdev ji ko god main lekar baith jaati he
 On the other hand, the milk starts to fall due to heating, Mata Maenade sees the milk falling as she wants to bring Ramdevji down from the dock, Ramdevji puts his hand towards the milk and with his god power, puts that pot down from the stove
 yah chamatkaar dekhakar mata manade va vahiin baithe ajmal ji va daasi sabhi dwarkanath kii jai jayakaar karte hai
 Once the child Ramdev insisted on the blooming horse, King Ajmal took him to the blossom and asked him to make the toy
 raja ajmal ne chandan or makhmali kapadey kaa ghoda banane ko kaha
 After seeing all this, the bloomer came in a greed and he kept a lot of clothes for his wife and used only a few of them
 jab balak ramdev ghode par baithe to ghoda unhen lekar akaash main chalaa gaya
 The king was angry at the bloomer and ordered him to be put in jail
 kuch samay pashchaat, balak ramdev waapas ghode ke saath aaye
 The bloomer pleaded with Ramdev to accept his mistake and escape
 baba ramdev ne dayaa dikhaate hue use maaf kiya
 Even now, the clothes horse is considered to be a special offering of Baba Ramdev
 sanwat 1425 main ramdev ji maharaj ne pokaran se 12 ki0me0 uttar disha main ek gaanv kii sthapana kii jiskaa naam runicha rakhaa
 People came and started settling in Runicha
 runicha gaanv bada sundar or romantic ban gaya
 Lord Ramdev used to understand his religion only in the service of the guests
 andhe, lule-langade, kodhi va dukhiyon ko hameshaa hriday se lagaakar rakhte the
 At one time Ramdev ji sat in the court and resolved to throw the flag of private religion by throwing the untouched, untouched root from the root, then in the same court, a Seth Bohitaraja sat there singing the praises of the Lord in the court, then Lord Ramdev Ji called him and Seth you go to the state and bring Maya
 prabhu ke vachan sunakar bohitaraaj ghabaraane laga to bhagwaan ramdev ji bole he bhakt jab bhi tere par sankat aave tab main tere har sankat main madad karuunga
 Then Seth left from Runicha and reached the state and earned a lot of money by the grace of Prabhu
 ek varsh main seth hero kaa bahut bada johari ban gaya
 After some time, Seth remembered his children and started preparing to come to his village Runicha
 sethji ne sochaa runicha jaaunga to ramdevji puuchhenge ki mere liye pradesh se kya laaye tab seth ji ne prabhu ke liye hiron kaa haar kharida or naukaron ko aadesh diya ki saare hira panna jevaraat sab kuch naav main bhar do, main apane desh jaaunga or seth sara saamaan lekar ravaanaa hua
 Seth ji thought that this necklace is very valuable, what Lord Ramdev ji will do to this necklace, he got greed and started thinking that what Runicha is a small village, what will i do by staying there, live in a big city and build a big palace
 
 itane main hi samudr main jor kaa tufaan aane laga, naav chalaane vaala bolaa seth ji tufaan bahut bhayankar he naav kaa paradaa bhi fat gaya he
 Now the boat cannot move, the boat will sink
 yah maaya aapke kis kaam kii ham donon marenge
 Seth Bohitaraj also lost patience
 anek devi devataaon ko yaad karne laga lekin sab bekaar, kisi bhi devtaa ne uski madad nahin kii tab sethji ko shri ramdev ji kaa vachan kaa dhyaan aayaa or seth prabhu ko karuna bhari aawaaj se pukaarane laga
 Oh God, i have made a mistake that forgive me
 is prakaar sethji dariyaa main bhagwaan shri ramdev ji ko pukaar rahe the
 On the other hand, Lord Shri Ramdev was sitting in Runicha with his brother Viramdev ji and he heard the call of Bohitaraja
 bhagwaan ramdev ji ne apni bhujaa pasaari or bohitaraaj seth kii jo naav dub rahi thi usko kinare le liya
 This work was done so quickly that even Bhai Veeram Dev sitting nearby did not even know
 ramdev ji ke haath samudr ke pani se bhig gaye the
 Bohitraj Seth wondered how the boat suddenly hit the shore
 itane bhayankar tufaan seth se bachakar seth ke khushi kii seemaa nahin rahi
 The sailor also wondered how the boat got out of the storm so soon, it all happened by the grace of some deity
 seth bohitaraaj ne kaha ki jisaki raksha karne vaale bhagwaan shri ramdev ji he uskaa koi bal baankaa nahin kar saktaa
 Then the sailors also considered Shri Ramdev ji as their favorite god
 gaanv pahunchakar seth ne sari baat gaanv vaalan ko bataayi
 Seth went to the court and met Shri Ramdev ji and said that i had forgotten you after seeing Maya, i was tempted
 mujhe kshamaa karen or aadesh karen ki main is maaya ko kahan kharch karuun
 Then Shri Ramdev Ji said that you carve a stepwell in Runicha and the water of that stepwell will be sweet and people will call it as Parcha Bavdi and its water will be as holy as the Ganges
 is prakaar ramdeora main aaj bhi yah parchaa baavdi bani huyi he
 Due to miracle, people started coming from village to village
 yah baat maulaviyon or piron ko bhi pataa chali
 Lord Shri Ramdev used to go door to door and preach to the people that there is nothing high and low, every caste should get equal rights
 piron ne shri ramdev ji ko parakhane kaa vichaar kiya ki apane se bade pir jo makka main rahete hai unako khabar di ki hinduon main ek mahaan pir paidaa hue hai jo mare hue praani ko jinda kar dete hai, andhe ko aankhe dete hai, atithiyon kii seva karnaa hi apana dharm samajhate hai, unki pariksha lee jaae
 When this news reached Mecca, five Pirs left Mecca
 kuch dinon main ve pir runicha kii ore pahunche
 The five peers asked Lord Ramdev ji, o brother, how far is Ranicha from here, then Lord Ramdevji said that this village which is visible in front is the same Runicha, can i ask the reason for your visit? Then one of those five Pirs said that we have to meet Ramdev Ji here
 tab prabhu bole he piraji main hi ramdev hoon aapke samaane khadaa hoon kahiye mere yogya kya seva he
 Hearing the words of Shri Ramdev ji, the five peers accompanied the Lord
 ramdevji ne paanchon piron kaa bahut seva satkar kiya
 Prabhu came to the palace with all the five peers, there were cushions, pillows and bedspreads and Piraji used to sit on the cushions but Shri Ramdev sat on the bed and said, o Pirji, you are our guest, you have come to our house by eating with us
 To visit itnaa sunakar piron ne kaha ki he ramdev bhojan karne vaale katore ham makka main hi bhuulakar aa gaye hai
 We eat food in the same bowl and the other vessel is forbidden
 aapako bhojan karana he to wo hi katoraa jo ham makka main bhuulakar aaye hai mangava dijiye to ham bhojan kar sakate hai varanaa ham bhojan nahin karenge
 Then Ramdev Ji said, o Pir ji, if it is so, i will ask for your bowls
 aisa kahkar bhagwaan ramdev ji ne apana haath lambaa kiya or ek hi pal main paanchon katore piron ke saamne rakh diye or kaha pir ji ab aap is katore ko pahchaan lo or bhojan karo
 When the pirs saw the five bowls of corn, the five peers believed in the greatness of Shri Ramdev ji and were very impressed by his thoughts and conduct and started saying, "we are Pir but you are great Pir
" aaj se aapako duniya ramapir ke naam se jaanegi
 In this way the Pirs dined and Sri Ramdevji got the title of Pir and was called Ramsapir, Ramapir
 baba ramdev ji ne sanwat 1425 main runicha basaakar apane mata pita kii seva main jute gaye idhar ramdev ji kii mata manade ek din apane pati raja ajmal ji se kehane lagi ki apana rajkumaar bada ho gaya he ab isaki sagaai kar dijiye taaki ham bhi putravadhu dekh saken
 When Baba Ramdev ji was born, at that time, he came by promising Rukmini that i will marry you
 sanwat 1426 main amar kot ke thakur dal ji sodha kii putree naitalde ke saath shri ramdev ji kaa vivaah hua
 It is believed that Baba Ramdev took a living samadhi on Bhadrapad Shukla Dashami
 sanwat 1442 ko ramdev ji ne apane haath se shriphal lekar sab bade budhon ko pranaam kiya tathaa sabane patr pushp chadhaakar ramdev ji kaa hardik tan man va shraddha se antim pujan kiya
 Ramdev stood in the Samadhi and gave his last sermon to everyone and said that every month the Shukla Paksha of Duj should be worshiped, worshiped by worshiping hymns and celebrating the night
 prativarsh mere janmotsav ke upalaksh main tathaa antardhyaan samadhi hone kii smriti main mere samadhi str par mela lagegaa
 Don't keep confusion and discrimination in my samadhi poojan
 main sadaiv apane bhakton ke saath rahungaa
 In this way Shri Ramdev Ji Maharaj took samadhi

 Stereoscopy refers to a technique used to create or increase the illusion of depth
 These 2D offset images then combine into the brain to perceive the depth of the 3D
 Three strategies have been used under it * Wearing eyeglasses to combine different images coming from two sources * Viewer Wear glasses to sieve single source images for each of your eyes * Source fission of images so that images go directly to the viewer's eye
 sterioscopy 2 di chhaviyo ko 3 di chhaviyo me badalata he
 Usually stereoscopy imaging makes 2 dimensional images into 3 dimensional images
 In the beginning it puts 2 images of the same image in our brain, which have little difference

 vishesh— is samay saare sansar main praayah hajaaron prakaar kii bhashaayen boli jaati hai jo saadharantah apane bhashiyon ko chhod or logon kii samaj main nahin aatin
 People know the language of their society or country well because they are accustomed since childhood, but the language of other countries or societies does not speak well without it
 bhashavigyaan ke gyaataaon ne bhashaaon ke arya, semetic, hemetic aadi kai varg sthapit karke unamem se prayek kii alag alag shakhaayen sthapit kii hai or un shakhaakon ke bhi anek varg upvarg banaakar unamem badi badi bhashaaon or unke prantiy bhedon, upbhaashaon athaav boliyon ko rakhaa he
 Just like our Hindi language is a language of the Indian Arya branch of the Aryan class of languages in terms of linguistics; And Brajbhasha, Awadhi, Bundelkhandi etc
 are its dialects or dialects
 paas paas boli janevaali anek upbhaashaon yaa boliyon main bahut kuch samya hota he; or usee samya ke aadhaar par unke varg yaa kul sthapit kiye jate hai
 This is also the case in many big languages whose mutual equilibrium is not so much, but still a lot happens

 praayah bhashaa ko likhit rup main vyakt karne ke liye lipiyon kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Language and script are two integral aspects of emotionalization
 ek bhashaa kai lipiyon main likhi ja sakati he or do yaa adhik bhashaaon kii ek hi lipi ho sakati he
 For example, Punjabi, Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi are written in both, while Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit, Nepali etc
 are all written in Devanagari
 bhashaa ko pracheen kaal se hi paribhaashit karne kii koshish kii jaati rahi he
 Some of its main definitions are as follows: ham vyavhaar main yah dekhte hai ki bhashaa kaa sambandh ek vyakti se lekar sampoorn vishwa-sristi tak he
 There are many forms of property earned from this tradition in practice between the individual and society
 samaaj saapekshata bhashaa ke liye anivaary he, thik vaise hi jaise vyakti saapekshata
 And language is indicative ie it is a 'symbol-position'
 isaki pratikatmak gatividhi ke chaar pramukh sanyojak haih do vyakti-ek vah jo sambodhit karata he, doosraa vah jise sambodhit kiya jaataa he, teesri sanketit vastu or chauthi-pratikatmak samvahak jo sanketit vastu kii ore pratinidhi bhangima ke saath sanket karata he
 In the process of development, the scope of language also increases
 yahi nahin ek samaaj main ek jaisi bhashaa bolne vaale vyaktiyon kaa bolne kaa dhang, unki ucchapan-prakriya, shabd-bhandar, vaakya-vinyas aadi alag-alag ho jane se unki bhashaa main paryaapt antar aa jaataa he
 This can be called style
 yon boli, vibhaasha or bhashaa kaa moulik antar bataa paanaa kathin he, kyonki isamen mukhyatya antar vyavhaar-kshetra ke vistaar par nirbhar he
 Due to individual diversity, many forms of the same language are seen in a society
 mukhya rup se bhashaa ke in roopon ko ham is prakaar dekhte hai- language, vibhaasha, or Language boli or bhashaa main antar hota he
 It is a small unit of language
 iskaa sambandh gram yaa mandal arthath simit kshetra se hota he
 In this, the predominance is through the medium of personal colloquial and there is an abundance of indigenous words and domestic vocabulary
 yah mukhya rup se bolchaal kii bhashaa he, iskaa rup kuch-kuch duuri par badalte paaya jaataa he tathaa lipibaddh na hone ke kaaran isamen saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa abhaav rahata he
 Anomalies are also found in it grammatically
 vibhaasha kaa kshetra boli kii apeksha vistrut hota he yah ek praant yaa uppraant main prachlit hoti he
 In a division, many dialects prevail on the basis of local differences
 vibhaasha main saahitiyik rachanaae mil sakati hai
 Language, or say the defined language or ideal language, is a developed state of division
 ise raashtra-bhashaa yaa taksaali-bhashaa bhi kaha jaataa he

 and it is declared as the official language or national language
