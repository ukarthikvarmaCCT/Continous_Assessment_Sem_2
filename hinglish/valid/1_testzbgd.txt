 marshall ke shishy jaan menard keens kaa 'rojgaar, byaaj evam mudra kaa saamaanya siddhant' naamak granth arthshaastra kii vishesh mahatvapurn pustak he
 In fact, this book has completely changed the ideology of Western economists
 isi par herad domer kaa suprasiddh vikaas model, liyontif kaa in-put output model aadi kai mahatvapurn siddhant udbhoot hue hai
 Prof
 Samuel Simonson believes that no individual or economist once returned to old ideologies after being influenced by Keynes's analysis
 keens ke prabhaav ke kaaran hi unke purvavarti aalochak bhi unke samarthak ho gaye
 He was very forthright and that is why his economic views were settled
 unhone vyaavhaarik kshetra main bhi yathesht yogadan diya tha
 He has been an active contributor to the founding of New Deal of America, International Monetary Fund and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development etc
 keens vyashti arthshaastra ke janmdata rahe hai
 That is why his treatise 'general Theory' became so popular
 vaise bhi is granth main unhone vyapak aarthik vishleshan ko spasht kiya
 He gave economics the principle of total income and effective demand
 unke anusaar rojgaar prabhavi maang par nirbhar karata he
 Effective demand depends on self-use and appropriation
 upbhog kaa nirdhaaran aay ke aakaar or samaaj kii upbhog pravriti ke anusaar hota he
 Therefore, if employment is to increase, both consumption and appropriation should increase
 keens ne marshall, pigu, fisher dwaara di gai aay kii sthitik paribhaashaon main se kisi ko bhi sweekaar nahin kiya kyonki keens ken anusaar ve un tatwon par koi prakaash nahin daalatin jo kisi vishesh samay main arthvyavastha main rojgaar or aay ke str ko nirdhaarit karte hai
 Keynes first defined national income in a way that would help him determine employment in society
 marshall ke mulya siddhant kaa aadhaar jis prakaar 'keemat' he, vaise hi keens ke rojgaar siddhant kaa aadhaar 'aay' he
 According to him, there will be 'total income = total utilization + total appropriation'
 unhone 'rashtriya aay' ke hetu kaha ki chunki 'aay=upyog+bachat tathaa 'vyay = upbhog + viniyog' he, isliye 'upyog + bachat = upbhog + viniyog' yaa 'bachat=viniyog' ke hoga
 Keynes's income analysis tells us that in order to protect the economy from huge fluctuations, it is necessary to maintain equality between savings and appropriation
 mandi kaaleen kuprabhavon ko dur karne ke liye keens ne sasti mudraniti, saarvajanik nirmaan kaary or dhan ke uchit bantwaare se upbhog pravriti main vruddhi ke liye sarkari vyay evam nitiyon kii sahaayta kii he
 Keynes's principle applies more to developed countries and less to underdeveloped countries
 parantu yadi alpaviksit deshon main bhi prabhavi maang or bachat utpann ho sake to keens kaa arthshaastra vahaan par bhi lagu ho saktaa he
 In fact, in view of the unemployment, recession, price rise, etc
 of the present world, it would be appropriate to follow Keynes's policies firmly and surely most influenced by Keynes's principles

 Criminal profiling is also known as criminal profiling, criminal personality profiling, criminological profiling, behavior profiling or criminal investigation analysis

 Holmes and Holmes outline three main goals of the criminal framework: einsavart profiling apradhi ko chaar mukhya drushtikon se dekhte hai ki pahchaan: 5 procedural steps in generating a profile: 1
 aapraadhik krity ke prakaar / prakruti kaa gahan vishleshan kiya jaataa he or yah to ateet main isi tarah ke aparaadhon ke liye patibaddh he, jo logon ke prakaar kii tulana main haivaastavik aparaadh sthal kaa gaharaai se vishleshan main 2

 This information is combined with other relevant details and physical evidence, and abnormalities to develop a practical working description of the offender

 a more detailed example of how psychological profiling can be demonstrated is the investigation of Gary Leon Ridgeway, also known as the Green River Killer
 is maamle main bhi galat bhavishyavaaniyon ke liye kshamta ko darshata he
 John E
 Douglas, an investigator who worked for the FBI, suspects a twelve-page profile stating that: haalanki, rizveke liye banaai gai profile bhi is tarah ke anya logon se nikatataa ke kaabil hone ke rup main use karne ke liye aavedan nahin kiya he ki visheshtaon, kaa pataa chalaa
 Ridgeway was not a mismatch but contradicted the point in the profile of not being too close, often in the Green River with one of his wives, who had a very close relationship with his previous wife 
 aapraadhik ruparekha kaa ek prakaar linkage vishleshan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Gerard Ann Labuschein defines relationship analysis as "a form of behavioral analysis that is used to determine the likelihood of a series of offenses as being committed by an offender
" " apradhi ke aparaadh ke pattern main is tarah ke kai pahaluon sabha kaam karne kaa dhang, anushthan yaa pradarshit kii kalpana aadhaarit vyavhaar, or apradhi madad ke hastakshar ke rup main ek kadi ke vishleshan ke liye ek aadhaar sthapit karne ke liye

 Dr
 Bond also tried to reconstruct the murder and explain the behavior pattern of the perpetrator: soon he came up with a profile or signature personality traits of the perpetrator to aid the police investigation
 profil kaha ki report shaareerik rup se bana he, majboot, or saahsee tha, jo akele hi ek vyakti dwaara patibaddh kiya gaya tha likhaa gaya tha us samay kshetra main saat main se paanch kii hatya kar
 The unknown criminal would be calm and middle-aged, possibly harmless in appearance, and neatly dressed outside, perhaps wearing a cloak to hide the bloody effects of his attacks in the open
 unhone kaha ki ek ek vaastavik kabje, sanakee bina kunvaara he, or maansik rup se asthir ho jayega
 Even Satirassus, he said, is today referred to as overconfidence or parochialism that one may suffer from a condition called sexual deviancy
 bond bhi kaha ki vah apradhi koi sanrachanaatmak gyaan tha mana jaataa he or ek sarjan yaa kasaai nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki ullekh kiya he
 Bond's basic profile was: "kaatil narsanhaarak or kaamuk unmaad ke samay-samay par hamalon ke adheen shaareerik shakti or mahaan thandak or saahas kaa ek aadmi 


 avashya kiya gaya he
 The characters of the pathology indicate that the man may be in sexual condition, that can be called "satirassus"

 Keep in mind your possible responses to the idea
 da langer ke profil hitler, saavdhaneepurvak paaramparik, or unki upasthiti or sharir ke bare main paakhandee tha ki ullekh kiya
 He was strong and saw himself as a standard carrier and practice
 unhone unmatta charnon tha, phir bhi thodaa vyaayaam liya
 Due to the lack of evidence, Langer, Hitler believed in reasonably good health, so that it was unlikely that he would die of natural causes, but he was mentally deteriorating
 unhone kaha ki ek tatasth desh ke liye bhaagane kii koshish nahin karenge, or na hi vah khud ko mitra rashtron dwaara kabja kiya ja karne kii anumati hogi
 Hitler always went diagonally from one corner to another when he crossed a room, and he whistled a moving tune
 unhone kaha ki sifalis or keetanuon kaa dar tha
 Langer's profile is also pointed out by Hitler's Oedipal campus, with the effect being his mother, the need to prove his manhood
 unhone siikhaa he or visheshadhikaar praapt ghrinaaspad, lekin shastreey sangeet, wadevil, or richard wagonar ke opera kaa anand liya

 However, Malcolm Gladwell wrote that the culprit is not an outline of science at all, but it can support almost any interpretation that is written in such vague language; And Brussels says about: brussels sach main pagal bombar ke man samaj main nahin aayaa
 He said that if you make a large number of predictions were wrong, people will soon forget, only think that is understood, and turn out that people will make you famous may be true

 prerana vyavhaar kii vyakhya karne ke liye istemaal ek saidhantik nirmaan he
 It represents reasons for people's actions, desires and needs
 prerana bhi vyavhaar karne kii disha ke rup me paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 a motive prompts the individual to act in a certain way or at least develops an inclination for specific behavior

 Theories of motivation can be classified into several types
 prerana ko do alag siddhant main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he- aantarik prerana or bahya prerana
 Intrinsic motivation has been studied since the 1970s
 aantarik prerana kaa nirikshan karne or gyaan praapt karne ke liye ek kshamta kaa vishaleshan karne, nai chizon or nai chunauntiyon ke baahar kii talash karne ke liye swayam kii ichha he
 It is driven by an interest or enjoyment in itself, and exists within the individual, relying on external pressure or a desire for reward
 aantarik prerana kii ghatana pehle pashuon ke vyavhaar kaa praayogic adhyayan ke bheetar sweekaar kiya gaya tha
 Intrinsic motivation is a natural motivational tendency and an important element in cognitive, social, and physical development
 aantarik rup se prerit hue chaatro kii hi kshamtaaon main vruddhi hogi, jo apane kaushal me sudhaar karne ke liye kaam swechha ke saath hi kaam main sanlagn hone kii sambhaavna he
 Bahi motivation refers to performing an activity in order to achieve a desired result and is the opposite of intrinsic motivation
 bahya prerana vyakti ke baahar ke prabhaavon se aata he
 In outdoor motivation it is difficult to answer this question, where do people get inspiration to continue their work with perseverance? Generally, the result which is not achieved by internal motivation, the person to get the external motivation
 Uses aam bahya manshaa puraskaar he jaise paise yaa achche ank, vaanchit vyavhaar dikhaane ke liye or sazaa kaa khatra nimnlikhit durvyavhaar ke liye he
 The competition is a great motivator because it encourages the artist to win and to defeat others rather than just enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity
 saamaajik manovaiianik anusandhan ne yah sanket diya he ki bahya puraskaar atikachity karne ke liye netritv kar saktaa he or aantarik prerana me ek kami paidaa kar saktaa he

 kidney kii sujan ko chikitsa shaastra main glomerulonefritis kaha jaataa he
 Kidney inflammation is a kidney disease that causes inflammation in the filter of the kidney
 kidney kaa filter kidney main bahut choti rakt vahikaaon se bana hota he, jise glomeruli kaha jaataa he
 When it starts suddenly it can become severe and when it starts slowly it can become chronic
 lekin donon hi sthitiyon main iske parinaam bhayaavah ho sakate hai
 Early detection and early treatment will cause less harm
 lekin kuch maheenon tak iskaa ilaaj nahin karaane par isse kidney ko sthaayee kshati ho sakati he! Therefore, never ignore its symptoms ignorantly
 iske lakshanon ko samajhnaa bahut mahatvapurn he taaki samay par nefrology intervation kii madad se kidney ko bachaaya ja sake
 Our kidneys contain millions of glomeruli
 ye kidney main chote filter hote hai
 When damaged, the kidney cannot efficiently remove dirt and excess liquid for long periods of time
 yadi yah beemaari lagaataar bani rahati he, to kidney puri tarah se kaam karnaa band kar sakati hai
 Due to not having a blood filter, the kidneys can fail or can be found in the urine
 — jaagane par chehre par sujan, pani jamaa hone ke kaaran takhnon main sujan - Brown urine or blood in urine — mutr main jhaag hona - Protein present in urine — kam peshaab hona - Fluid in the lungs, causing cough and difficulty in breathing — ucch rakt chaap When the disease becomes severe, the patient will feel its symptoms
 lekin chronic maamalon main, lakshan dhire-dhire viksit hote hai ki kabhi- kabhi marij un lakshanon ko samaj hi nahin pate
 In this way, due to ignorance, inflammation of the kidney filter causes permanent kidney damage and kidney failure
 kidney felyor se peedit logon kii bhukh kam ho sakati he, matlee or ulti ho sakati he
 They may feel tired and may have difficulty sleeping during the night due to muscle spasms

 In most cases, such infections are cured and the kidney improves
 kidney kii kai primary samasyaon kaa prabhaav glomerulas par padataa he
 Eg, minimal changes in nephropathy, FSGS
 jaldi ilaaj shuru kar dene par inamen se adhiktar samasyaayein thik ho jaati hai
 Secondary glomerulonephritis develops in people suffering from systemic diseases such as diabetes, and some auto-immune diseases such as lupus and ANCA vasculitis
 aisi sthitiyon main bhi samay par ilaaj se kidney ko bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes glomerulonephritis can also occur due to side effects of painkillers and antibiotics
 dushprabhav vaali dawa kii pahchaan kar or unka seven nahin kar rogi main sudhaar hota he
 Some situations are family
 samasya kii pahchaan nahin kar paane or ilaaj nahin karaane par chronic glomerulonefritis hone kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 This condition is unfortunately fast growing
 haalanki, nefrolaji visheshgy se sahi dhang se ilaaj karaane par beemaari kaa badhanaa ruk jaataa he
 High blood pressure, especially at an early age or difficulty in controlling it, can be a sign of onset of glomerulonephritis
 sujan, apach, kamajori iske anya lakshan hai
 Probes that detect the presence of RBC / blood and protein in urin are very inexpensive and are a readily available test
 uria creatinin eene si 3 si 4 eensie si or pi eyeso jaise rakt pareekshan se doctor ko pataa lagane main madad milti he ki aapako kis prakaar kii beemaari he or usase aapaki kidney ko kitna nuksaan pahunchaa he
 If the kidney size is normal, a kidney biopsy may be required
 biopsy kii report se chikitsak ko aapke liye sabase acha ilaaj kii yojana banane main madad milti he
 Treatment for this disease depends on the condition being acute or chronic, its underlying causes and severity of symptoms
 sankraman ke baad hone vaala glomerulo nefritis aamtaur par sankraman ke niyantrit ho jane ke baad swatah thik ho jaataa he
 In addition, the patient may have to reduce fluid intake, and avoid the consumption of alcohol or beverages or foods containing more protein, salt, or potassium
 mutrvardhak ucch raktchaap ko kam karne main madad kare sakate hai or gurda ke dhimi gati se kaam karne main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 Blood pressure medicine relaxes blood vessels
 pratiraksha samasyaon se peedit vyakti ko plasmaferesis karnaa pad saktaa he
 Plasmapheresis is a mechanical process in which plasma is removed from the blood with antibodies, and replaced with other fluid or donated plasma
 antarnihit kaarnon ke aadhaar par, steroid, cychlophasphamide, cychlosporin, tecrolimus, ajaithioprin mmef aadi jaisi dawaaon kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 In case of kidney failure, dialysis may be required
 lekin aise ilaaj kii jarurat asthaayee taur par hoti he or kidney main sudhaar hone ke baad dialysis ko band kar diya ja saktaa he
 If the disease cannot be cured in this condition, then the disease becomes chronic and progressive
 aisi sthitiyon main bhi, beemaari kii pragati ko dhimaa karne ke liye dawaaon or nefrology follow-ap ke saath uchit aahaar kii yojana jaruri hoti he
 - Treat streptococcal infection causing a sore throat or blockage
 — madhumeh or raktchaap ko niyantran main rakhen - Have safe sex and avoid the use of illegal intravenous drugs to avoid infections such as hepatitis B, c and HIV which may cause glomerulonephritis
 — sujan, apach or ucch raktchaap ke shuruaati lakshanon ko nazarandaaj na karen
 - Never ignore protein and RBC / blood found in urine test report
 — yadi aapkaa doctor kidney biopsy kii salaah detaa he, to daren mat
 This type of procedure can be helpful in treating your kidney
 — vyaayaam, gunvattta purna neend or swasth kam protein vaale aahaar ke seven ke saath-saath swasth jivan style apnaane se chronic glomerulonefritis ke maamle main kidney felyor kii vruddhi ko rokane main madad milegi
 - It is necessary to have a nephrolologist checked regularly in all stages of glomerulonephritis

 hindi main ise 'aatmavimoh' or 'svaparayanata' bhi kehete hai
 The affected person behaves in a limited and repetitive manner, such as repeating the same task over and over
 yah sab bachche ke teen saal hone se pehle hi shuru ho jaataa he
 a set of these symptoms differentiates narcissism from mild narcotic spectrum disorder, such as Asperger's syndrome
 otism ek maansik rog he jiske lakshan janm se hi yaa baalyavastha se nazar aane lagaten hai
 The development of children who have this disease is unusual compared to other children
 otism hone ke koi ek kaaran nahin khoja ja sakaa he
 According to the recommendations, there can be many reasons for autism such as- aatmavimoh kaa ek majboot anuvanshik aadhaar hota he, haalanki aatmavimoh kii anuvanshiki jatil he or yah spasht nahin he ki ASD kaa kaaran bahujine samvaad he yaa durlabh utparivartan 
 In rare cases, narcissism has also been linked to factors that are responsible for birth defects
 anya prastaavit kaarnon me, bachapan ke tike, vivaadaaspad hai or iske koi vaigyanik saboot bhi nahin he
 According to a recent review, two cases per 1000 people are self-reported, while the number is close to 6 / 1000 for ASD
 ausatan ASD kaa purush:mahila anupaat 4,3:1 he
 Cases of narcissism have increased dramatically since 1980, one of the reasons being the growth in the field of medical diagnosis, but whether these cases have actually increased is an unanswered question
 aatmavimoh mastishk ke kai bhaagon ko prabhavit karata he, par iske kaarnon ko dhang se nahin samajha jaataa
 Parents usually recognize its symptoms in the first two years of their child's life
 shuruaati sangyanatmak yaa vyavhaari hastkshep, bacchon ko swayan kii dekhbhaal, saamaajik or baatcheet kaushal ke vikaas main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 There is no cure for it
 bahut kam aatistic bachche hi vayask hone par aatmanirbhar hone main safal ho pate hai
 Nowadays, a self-imposed culture has developed, in which some people believe in treatment and for some people self-immolation is a condition rather than a disorder
 aatmavimoh ko ek lakshan ke bajaay ek vishisht lakshanon ke samooh dwaara behatar samajha ja saktaa he
 Key symptoms include inability to social interaction, inability to communicate, limited hobbies, and repetitive behavior
 anya pahaluon me, jaise khaane kaa ajeeb tarika haalaanki aam he lekin nidaan ke liye aavashyak nahin he
 Social development In addition to being incapable of self-immolation, humans are unable to understand the intentions of other people, so people often do not take them seriously
 saamaajik asamarthataayen bachapan se shuru ho kar vyask hone tak chalati hai
 Autistic children tend to be indifferent to social activities, do not look at people, do not smile, and most commonly do not react: even when they are called
 otistic shishuon kaa vyavhaar to or chaunkaane vaala hota he, wo aankh nahin milaate hai or apni baat kehane ke liye wo aksar duusare vyakti kaa haath choote or hilaate hai
 Children between three and five years of age usually do not display social understanding, do not respond at all to calls, are insensitive to feelings, silent behaviorists and turn to others
 iske baavjood wo apni praathmik dekhbhaal karne vaale vyakti se jude hote he
 Children with narcissism exhibit less attuned protection than normal children, although this symptom disappears in children with high brain development or who have low ASD
 ASD se grasit bade bachche or vyask chehron or bhaawanaaon ko pahchaanane ke pareekshan main bahut bura pradarshan karte hai
 Contrary to popular belief, autistic children do not like to be alone
 dost bananaa or dosti banaae rakhana aatistic bachche ke liye aksar mushkil sabit hota he
 For them, the quality of friendship matters not the number of friends
 ASD se peedit logon ke gusse or hinsa ke bare main kaaphi kisse hai lekin vaigyanik adhyayan bahut kam hai
 These limited statistics show that only children with narcissism are aggressive or aggressive
 dominic at al, ne 67 ASD se grast bacchon ke mata-pita kaa saakshaatkaar liya or nishkarsh nikaala ki, do tihaai bacchon ke jivan main aanse daur aate hai jab unka vyavhaar bahut bura ho jaataa he jabaki ek tihaai bachche aakraamak ho jate hai, aksar bhashaa ko thik se na jaanane vaale bachche nakhrel hote hai
 There are some major differences between normal children and autistic children in childhood, on the basis of which this condition can be identified as- ek tihaai se lekar aadhe otistik vyaktiyon main apane dainik jivan kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke laayak bhashaa bodh tathaa bolne kii kshamta viksit nahin ho paati
 Shortcomings in communication are visible in the first year of life, including late speaking, unusual gestures, sluggish response, and a lack of cohesion in conversations with your foster
 duusare or tisare saal main, otistic bachche kam bolte hai, saath hi unka shabd sanchay or shabd sangyojan bhi vistrut nahin hota
 Their expressions often do not match their spoken words
 aatistic bacchon main anurodh karne yaa anubhavon ko baantne kii sambhaavna kam hoti he or unamem bas dusron kii baaten ko dohraane kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he 
 Functional communication requires joint attention, and this combined attention deficit distinguishes ASD infants from others: Example: Instead of the object they are pointing at, they might see the hand they are pointing to
 And they are failing to do so continuously
 otistic bacchon ko kalpanasheel khelon main or bhashaa seekhney main kathinaayee ho sakati he
 No particular repetition is related to narcissism, but narcissism is responsible for these behaviors
 otism ko sheeghra pahchaanana or manorog visheshgy se turant paraamarsh hi iskaa sabase pehla ilaaj he
 Contact a psychiatrist, psychologist, or trained special educator if symptoms of autism appear
 otism ek aaajeevan rahane vaali avasthaa he jiske purna upachaar ke liye koi dawa kii khoj zaari he, atah iske ilaaj ke liye yahan-vahaan na bhataken va bina samay gavaayen iske bare main jaankaree praapt karen
 Autism is a type of developmental disease that cannot be cured completely, but the patient can be taught a lot through proper training and counseling, which helps him to take care of himself in his daily life
 otism se grasit 70% vayaktiyon main maansik mandatha paayi jaati he jiske kaaran vah ek saamaanya jivan jeene main puri tarah se samarth nahin ho pate, parantu yadi maansik mandatha bahut aghik na ho to otism se grasit vyakti bahut kuch sikh paata he
 Sometimes some such abilities are also seen in these children which are far from the understanding and reach of normal people
 otism se grasit bachche ko nimnlikhit tareekon se madad di ja sakati he- If the child does one behavior again and again, to prevent it, engage him in some activities that keep him busy so that they do not repeat the behavior, rashtriya rajmarg 22- 459 kilometre lanbaa yah rajmarg ambala se bharat-tibet seemaa ke paas shipakila tak jaataa he
