 Once king Daksh carried out a Yajna prayer service
 isamen unhone saare devataaon ko apana-apana yajna-bhaag praapt karne ke liye nimantrit kiya, kintu shankaraji ko unhone is yajna main nimantrit nahin kiya
 When Sati heard that her father was performing a huge yajna ritual, her mind became anxious to go there
 apni yah ichha unhone shankaraji ko bataai
 After considering all the things, he said - Prajapati Daksha is angry with us for some reason
 apane yajna main unhone saare devataaon ko nimantrit kiya he
 Their sacrificial fires have also been dedicated to them, but we have not called them consciously
 koi soochna tak nahin bheji he
 In such a situation, it will not be good for you to go there
 ' Sati did not become enlightened by this preaching by Shankarji
 pita kaa yajna dekhne, vahaan jaakar mata or bahanon se milane kii unki vyagrata kisi prakaar bhi kam na ho saki
 Seeing his strong request, Lord Shankarji allowed him to go there
 sati ne pita ke ghar pahunchakar dekha ki koi bhi unase aadar or prem ke saath baatcheet nahin kar rahaa he
 All the people are turning their faces
 keval unki mata ne sneh se unhen gale lagaaya
 The sisters' words were full of sarcasm and derision
 parijanon ke is vyavhaar se unke man ko bahut klesh pahunchaa
 He also saw that there is a sense of disdain for the four-pronged Lord Shankar
 daksh ne unke prati kuch apmanjanak vachan bhi kahe
 Seeing all this, Sati's heart became content with anger, guilt and anger
 unhone sochaa bhagwaan shankaraji kii baat na maan, yahan aakar maine bahut badi galati kii he
 She could not bear the insult of her husband Lord Shankar
 unhone apane us rup ko tatkshan vahiin yogagni dwaara jalaakar bhasma kar diya
 On hearing this darun-sad incident like a thunderbolt, Shankar ji got angry and sent his people to complete the destruction of the Yajna of Daksha
 sati ne yogagni dwaara apane sharir ko bhasma kar agle janm main shailaraj himalay kii putree ke rup main janm liya
 This time she became famous by the name 'shailputri'

 kisi prakashasrot se utsarjit prakaash urja kaa maapan karne ke liye anek vidhiyaan prachlit hai
 Various types of instruments are used in them
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab kisi prakashasrot se utsarjit prakaash ek tapavaidyut punj ke krishna tal par padataa he tab us tal ke taap main vruddhi hoti he
 From which light energy can be measured

 But all these methods can only compare the relative magnitudes of energy, not the radian or luster of those light sources, because the luminosity of the light source depends on the wavelength of the light emitted from them
 beauti kaa aapekshik gyaan hamen apane netron dwaara bhalee prakaar hota he, kintu hamaare netra bhi adhik vishwasaneey saadhan nahin hai

 Another method can also be to compare those sources of lights to the intensity of illumination of light on a plane illuminated by them

 In addition, that standard light source must be easily reproducible and in each case there should be sufficient stability in its various parts

 Therefore, it is no longer used and instead various types of electrically standard light sources are used

 From 1 January 1948, certain nations of the world have started using it again
 plankian vikirak ke prati ikai centimetre kii jyotiya tivrata ke shashth dashansh ko antarrashtriya candil yaa candela kaha jaataa he
 It is measured in candle strength
 kisi prakashasrot dwaara prati second prati ikai ghan kone main preshit jyotiya flux ko us strot kii pradeepan kshamta kehete he
 Suppose a center of radius sphere has an international candle light source on it
 is strot dwaara utsarjit flux gole ke sampurna aantarik tal par samaan rup se vitarit hoga
 If a part of the plane of the sphere with an area of C is taken, and all the points of its perimeter are merged with the center U, then a cube will be formed in which the entire light going through it will be on C
 chunki sampurna gole ke aantarik prishth par kul flux pha padataa he, iseliye sa par padanevaala falks pha kaa vaan bhaag hoga
 In this c / r 2 = cubic angle de
 at: yadi sa = r2 = 1 ho to da va = 1 tathaa padanevaala jyotiya flux = 1 hoga
 Therefore, we can define the unit of geometric flux as follows: The light energy emitted in the unit cube by a pointwise source corresponding to the potential of an international candle or the unit of radius by the unit of international candle strength, placed at the center of the radius of the unit radius
 The amount of light energy per second projected on the area is called the unit of geological flux Are
 is ikai ko luman kaha jaataa he
 It is clear from the above illustration that the flux emitted in the unit cube = 1 / 4p ′ total flux, but the total flux emitted by a standard candle = 4p lumen, so the flux emitted in the unit cube angle by a light source = ikai ghan kone main kisi prakashasrot dwaara utsarjit flux ko us strot kii pradeepan kshamta yaa pradipti kehete hai
 Thus, the illumination capacity of a light source is the ratio of the amount of light transmitted per second by that source to the unit area and the amount of light transmitted per unit area per second by a standard candle under these conditions
 yadi prakashasrot sabhi dishaao main samaan rup se prakaash vikiran nahin karata to kisi disha main, kisi ghankon daw main uski pradipti SW = will be expressed by or us dasha main kul flux = ikai ghankon ke flux ke madhyamaan ko prakashasrot kii madhyagoleey candil shakti kehete hai
 Its value will be as per the above discussion
 pradipt tal ke prati ikai kshetra par prakshipt prakaash flux yaa tivrata ko luman prati varg foot yaa luman prati varg meter main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 Suppose that there is a small floor area and distance of the narrow field of a light source of candle power
 spasht he ki prati second is kshetra par padanevaala flux = k
 da va = k
 das / r2 luman arthath k / r2 luman prati varg kshetra hoga or yah flux duuri r ke varg ke anusaar ghatata jaayga
 Therefore the illuminance unit intensity will be equal to the intensity of illumination over the area that is placed opposite to the source of the unit candle power, at unit distance, opposite to the incident light
 maapan kii prachlit pranaaliyon main isaki ikaiyaan kramash: meter candil or foot candil hai
 If the perpendicular plane is inclined q angle to the perpendicular, not perpendicular to the direction of ten incidental light and the projection of ten is ten 'in the perpendicular direction, then the intensity of illumination at floor ten = ise lambert kaa kojya niyam kehete hai
 An illuminated plane absorbs some part of the projected light on itself and reflects the rest
 yadi vah paravartit prakaash kisi vishesh disha main jaataa he to us ore se dekhne par vah tal atyant deept dikhalaai padataa he, jaise darpanon main
 But if that floor diffuses the illuminated light, it looks less bright
 aise paravartan ko visarit paravartan kehete hai tathaa prakaash ko chaturdik visarit karanevaale talon ko visarit paravartak kehete hai
 If we place our eyes in front of a diffused reflective plane in such a way that the direction of vision is made by the angle of the plane of that surface and the area of the eye or asteroid of our eye is the boundary of the light projected on the star from some point on the lamp, the right angle
 If v is inside, then v = where r is the distance of the eye from that plane
 yadi netra kii disha main tal kii prabhavakaari candil shakti kasiri prati ikai kshetra ho to das kshetrafalavaale tal dwaara netra par prakshipt prakaash kii maatra = kasiri

 According to Lambert's law, q q = k cosine q), where k is the radiance of the visible plane in the direction of the normal
 yadi sampurna tal das se netra par bananevaala kone da vaa ho to The wa = arthath dawa = \ Per unit cubic angle of light = Therefore, the illumination of an illuminated plane does not depend on the direction of the eye of the beholder
 pun: maan le ki kisi tal kii pradipti batchri he
 To find the total geometric flux emitted on the area per unit projected by it, let us assume that the flux moving between q and angles from the ten plane crosses the unit distance at any moment
 us kshan main yah flux ikai ardhavyas ke ek gole ke, jiskaa centre tal das kaa madhya bindu he, bhitari tal par ek khand se vyaapt hoga jaisaa chitra 2 main pradarshit he

 Suppose q = B, then the total amount of transmitted light \ tal kii beauti ba = prati ikai kshetra par preshit kul prakaash kii maatra kaa 1 / p vaan bhaag
 If the light of an illuminated plane is 1 / p candle power per square-centimeter, it is called a labart

 Styles and Crawford discovered that light entering the eye near the center of the pupil is more effective in producing ocular responses
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki taar kii parima ke nikat se hokar netra ke andar janevaali prakaash kirane drushtipatal par apekshaakrit adhik tirchhi padati hai
 Therefore, their intensity seems to be lower than that of the aforementioned light rays

 san 1843 main bunsan ne ek atyant utkrisht upkaran kaa avishkaar kiya jo ramdard dwaara anusarit siddhant par hi adhrith tha, kintu usamen drushtigat pradipti kii tivrata kaa anumaan ke dwaara nirnay kar sakane ke badale sateek nirnay kar sakane kii suvidha thi
 This is one of the early astrologers used to compare the illumination capacity of two light sources
 iske praarambhik swaroop main do apaardarshee chhadon kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha, kintu ab ek hi chad prayukt hoti he
 The rods are illuminated by the two light sources in the method shown in Figure 4
 And when the shade of the rods produced on the screen appears to be of equal brightness, then it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the lights are the same

 The difficulty in this is that it cannot be decided from where the distances should be measured
 sarvotkrisht jyotirmapi kaa nirmaan lumor brodhan ne kiya tha or unke naam par use lumor-bradhan jyotirmapi kaha jaataa he
 Its composition and procedure can be understood from Figure 5 below

 a plaster is usually a swatch of 'aw Paris'
 a se visarit prakashakirane da1 ore da2 se paravartit hoti hai or prism pranali pa pha se hoti hui doordarshee l main jaati hai
 The illumination of both the planes of a in the field of vision appears as similar to that shown in Fig
 5
 The relative distances of light sources are arranged such that the field of view is uniformly illuminated
 tab a se donon kii dooriyaan naap lee jaati he
 It is the first astrologer to provide the best accurate results
 isamen ek khurdure shwet kaagaj kii chakti ke centre par tel bindu sthapit kar use parbhasi bana diya jaataa he, uske donon ore tulaneey prakashasroton ko rakhkar unki dooriyaan is prakaar samanjit kii jaati hai ki parbhasi bindu yaa tel-bindu tathaa kaagaj kaa shesh apaardarshee bhaag samaa beauti ke drushtigochar hon
 If the reflection coefficient of the opaque part is r and the reflection and refraction coefficient of the oil point are r and t respectively and the illumination of the right and left side, respectively, if and then the illumination of the opaque is the ray / p and the illumination of the translucent fraction / will be p
 jab donon sroton ko jyotirmapi ke donon ore rakhane par tathaa bai ore se dekhne par donon talon kii deeptiyaan samaan ho jaati hai to rayab = r' yab + t' yad If the values of r and r are the same for both the plane of the astrology and if you look from the right side then the lights on the flame board are the same
 in donon samikarnon ko sanyukt karne par Suppose in the first position that the distances from the head of the lamps are pressed and pain respectively, then in the second position, these distances are 'B' and 'D' respectively for the incident
 tathaa Where there are illumination intensities of the left and right sides of the pub and the post jyotirmapi pat respectively
 yadi jyotirmapi-shir donon ore se apati prakaash kii kirnon ke samaksh samamit sthit nahin he to uparyukt vidhi donon ore baari baari se vyavahrut kii jaati he or donon ore se praapt pradipti tivrataon ke anupaaton kaa jyamitiya madhyamaan le liya jaataa he

 By selecting certain sequences, an accounting picture can be made, which will cause the measurement of the image to be related to the difference between the relative stars and the parameters of the chosen star
 yah uparyukt siddhant par hi aadhrut jyotirmiti kii ek atyant utkrisht evam kaushalyukt shakha he jisamen kisi niharika ke kantimaan kaa maan gyaat kiya jaataa he
 In this scale, the nebula is considered like a star and it is taken care that all the light of the nebula enters the telescope and produces the same effect as the light emitted from a star

 All of them guided the Council with a deep commitment to the philosophy and work of the Council
 parishad inase nirdesh paakar, inke gyaan or buddhi se atyadhik labhanvit hui
 The Council basically performs its functions through its Inquiry Committees, and adjudicates the complaints received from Brex against the press for violations of journalistic rules or by the authorities for interfering in the freedom of the press
 parishad main shikaayat darj karne kii niyat prakriya he
 It is compulsory for a complainant to write to the editor of the defendant newspaper and to direct their attention to the offense of violation of journalistic policy or against public interest
 shikaayat kiye gayi maamle kii parishad ko kataran bhejne ke atirikt shikayatakarta ke liye yah ghona karnaa aavashyak he ki unhone apni sampurna jaankaree tathaa vishwaas ke anusaar parishad ke samaksh sampurna tathy prastut kar diye hai tathaa shikaayat main kathith kisi viy main kisi nyaayalay main koi maamla lambit nahin he or vah ki yadi parishad ke sammukh jaanch lambit hone ke dauraan shikaayat main kathith koi maamla nyaayalay kii kisi kaarywahi kaa viy ban jaataa he to ve tatkaal isaki soochna parishad ko denge
 The reason for this declaration is that in view of Section 14, 3, of the Act, the Council cannot take action in any matter which is sub judice
 yadi adhyaksh mahoday ko aisa lagata he ki jaanch ke paryaapt aadhaar nahin he, to shikaayat khaarij kar, parishad ko isaki report kar sakate hai, anyathaa samachaarpatr ke sampadak athwa sambaddh patrkaar se kaaran bataane ke liye kaha jaataa he ki unke viruddh kaarywahi na kii jaye
 On receipt of a written statement and other relevant material from the editor or journalist, the Secretariat of the Council places the matter before the Inquiry Committee
 jaanch samiti vistaar se shikaayat kii jaanch or pareekshan karti he
 If required, it asks for other details or documents from both parties
 partiyon ko vyaktigat rup se upasthit hone athwa kanoonee peshewar sahit apane praadhikrut pratinidhiyon ke madhyam se jaanch samiti ke sammukh sakshya dene kaa avasar diya jaataa he
 On the basis of the available facts and affidavits or oral evidence given to the Inquiry Committee, the Committee prepares its achievements and recommendations and puts it before the Council which may accept or reject them
 jahaan parishad santut hoti he ki ek samachar patr athwa samachar agency ne patrakarita niti ke staron athwa janaruchi kaa ulanghan kiya he athwa ek sampadak athwa shramjivi patrkaar ne vyavsaayik kadachaar kiya he, to parishad jaisi sthiti ho, samachapatr, samachar agency, sampadak athwa patrkaar kii parininda, bhartsana kar sakati he athwa unhen chetavanee de sakati he athwa unke aacharan kaa anumodan kar sakati he
 In the complaints lodged by the press against the authorities, the Council is empowered to make such comments as it deems fit in relation to the conduct of any authority, including the government
 parishad ke nirnay antim hote he or kisi vidhi nyaayalay main unpar aapatti nahin kii ja sakati
 Thus, the council has a lot of moral authority
 yadhyapi iske paas kanoonee rup se dene ke liye dandatmak adhikaar nahin he
 The Inquiry Regulations formulated by the Council give the Speaker the authority to take original action or issue notice to any party in relation to any matter falling within the purview of the Press Council Act
 saamaanya jaanch ke liye shikayatakarta dwaara parishad ke sammukh ek shikaayat darj kerani hoti he, iske alaava mul kaarywahi ke liye kaaphi had tak vahi prakriya hoti he jaisaaki saamaanya jaanch main hoti he
 To carry out its functions or to conduct an inquiry under the Act, the Council exercises certain powers vested in the Civil Court to investigate a case under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in relation to the following matters
 logon ko samman karne or upasthiti hetu dabaav daalane tathaa shapath dekar unka pareekshan karne hetu
 For the need to search and inspect documents
 shapathpatron par sakshya kii prapti hetu
 To demand any government record or copies of it from any court or office
 gavaahon athwa dastavejon ke pareekshan hetu kamishan jari karnaa or Any other matter, as specified
 parishad apana kaary karne ke liye partiyon se sahyog kii aashaa karti he
 In at least two cases, where the Council noticed that the parties were totally uncooperative or obstinate, the Council, under section 15 of the Act to compel them to appear before it and or to compel them to give records etc

 ek samachaarpatr, jise parishad dwaara teen baar parinindit kiya gaya tha, ke maamle main kuch avadhi hetu dak kii riyayati daron athwa akhabaari kaagaj ke vitaran, vigyapanon, manyata ke rup main kuch suvidhaayen or riyaayaten na dene par sambaddh praadhikariyon se sifarish karne kaa parishad ko adhikaar diye jane ke liye, parishad ne 1980 main adhinium main sanshodhan kaa prastaav kiya tha
 Approval of the Council's recommendation was made mandatory by the authorities
 iske atirikt parishad kaa vichaar tha ki, samachaarpatron ke maamalon ke samaan press parishad adhinium 1978 kii dhara 15 ke antargat, sarkaar sahit kisi praadhikaran ke aacharan kaa sammaan karte hue apane kinhin nirnyon athwa reporto main, aisi tippaniyan, jaisi vah uchit samajhe, karne ke parishad ke adhikaar main aise praadhikariyon ko chetavanee dene, unki bhartsana karne athwa unhen parinindit karne ke adhikaar bhi shaamil hona chahie or yah ki, is sambandh main parishad kii tippanyon ko sansad ke donon sadanon or athwa sambaddh rajya ke vidhaan ke sammukh rakhaa janaa chahie
 In 1987, the Council reconsidered the matter and after detailed deliberations decided to withdraw the motion for punitive rights as it was reconsidered in the present circumstances to curb the freedom of the press by the authorities
 Could be misused
 tabhi se, baar-baar, suzav sandarbh parishad ko diye gayi hai ki chookkarta samachaarpatron / patrakaron ko dand dene ke liye parishad ke paas dandatmak adhikaar hone chahie
 In response to this, the Council has consistently thought that the moral rights given to it under the existing scheme of the Act are sufficient
 oktober 1992 main nai dilli main press paridon ke antarratreey sammelan main apane udghaatan bhaashan main soochna or prasaaran kendriya mantri dwaara yah suzav doharaaya gaya, parantu parishad nen nimnilikhit kaarnon se ise sarv sammati se asweekaar kar diya - If the Council were empowered to punish / impose a penalty, it would be similar to the right to punish, which would only apply if complaints were made by the press against the government and its authorities
 sarthak dand dene kaa adhikaar kai maamalon ko uthaata he jinamein k, pramaan kaa daayitv, kha, pramaan kaa str, ga, kanoonee pratinidhitiv kaa adhikaar or laagat or gha, samiksha or athwa apil uplabdh hogi athwa nahin, shaamil hai
 All or any of these cases may have an effect against the basic premise that press communications provide a democratic, effective, and inexpensive facility for the hearing of complaints and that the resulting imperative will be that press offices result in formality, cost And access will become courts of known problems and exercising judicial authority and delay equally The basic purpose of the Press Council will fail
 disambar 1992 main, parishad ko kendriya sarkaar se ek patr praapt hua jisamen is viy par parishad ke vichaar maange gayi ki kya yah sunishchat karne ke liye ki, sampradayik lekhon ke sambandh main morganirdeshon ke ulanghan hetu press parishad dwaara parinindit samachaarpatron / patrikaon ko sarkaar se milane vaale protsaahan jaise vigyaapan aadi se vanchit rakhaa ja saktaa he, koi prakriya nirdit kii ja sakati he or kya press parishad yah suzav dene kii sthiti main hogi ki jab yah ek samachaarpatr / patrika ko morganirdeshon ke ulanghan kaa doshi tehraati he tab kya kaarywahi kii jaani chahie
 The Council, in its meeting of June 93, considered the matter in light of the stand taken by it in the past against giving punitive powers to the Council
 maamle par gaharaai se vichaar karne par, parishad ne anubhav kiya ki is samay parishad dwaara jis naitik adhikaar kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, vah kaaphi prabhavi he or press ko aatm niyaman kaa maarg dikhaane main dandatmak adhikaron kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 However, the Council decided that if a newspaper is circulated twice for any kind of immoral writing in three years, then copies of such decisions are sent to the Cabinet Secretary to the Government of India and the Chief Secretary to the concerned State Government, for information and such action, They should be sent as they deem fit in their discretion and the circumstances of the case
 parishad ne nirnay kiya ki teen varshon kii avadhi ko duusari baar parininda kii taarikh se ulte ginate hue purvavarti teen varshon ke rup main liya jaayegaa
 Newspapers in accordance with the higher expenditure levels for the assistance and guidance of news workers to the Council by Section 13 2A of the Press Council Act, 1978; Instructions have been given to make a code of conduct for news agencies and journalists
 aisi samhita bananaa ek sakriy kaary he jise samay or ghatnaon ke saath kadam se kadam milaanaa hoga
 The creation indicates that the Code may be prepared by the Press Council through its decisions on the basis of matters
 parishad dwaara janaruchi or patrakarita niti ke ulanghan shirk ke antargat bhartiya vidhi santhaan ke saath milakar pehle var 1984 main apane nirnyon / morganirdeshon ke jariye vyapak siddhaton kaa sangrah taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 This compilation of principles has been chosen from the decisions or awards of the Council or the guidelines issued by it or by it or by its President 
 var 1986 main, sarkaar or iske praadhikariyon ke viruddh shikayaton athwa maamalon, joki doorgaati or mahatvapurn prakruti ke the or jisamen sarkaar sahit kisi praadhikari ke aacharan kaa sammaan karte hue tippaniyan shaamil thim, main nirnyon or siddhanton se sambaddh press kii swatantraaa kaa ulanghan sheershak ke antargat sankalan kaa doosraa bhaag prakashit kiya gaya
 Since the year 1986, there has been a steady increase in the establishment of complaints and their disposal by the Press Council, including the quick process of Code creation
 1992 main parishad ne patrakarita niti nirdeshika prastut kii jisamen parishad dwaara jari morganirdeshon or nirnyon se chhantakar liye gayi patrakarita niti siddhant hai
 Since the Council has since made several very important decisions concerning the rights and obligations of the press, a 162-page, detailed and comprehensive second edition of the Guidelines has been issued
 isamen niztaa ke adhikaar kii sankalpana bhi di gai he or is sambandh main tathaa maghadirshan hetu ucch vyavsaayik staro ke anuroop samachar patronkiye jane vaale morganirdesh bhi vinirdit kiye gayi he
 Defamation law has also been supported in some aspects of it to guide the press, public servants and popular figures
 parishad ne nagarpalika samiti ke saarvajanik padaadhikariyon kii kathith manahani ke sambandh main mahatvapurn adhinirnay diya ki press athwa media ke viruddh nuksaan hetu kaarywahi kaa upachaar, sarkari padaadhikariyon ko unki sarkari duty ke nirvaah se sambaddh unke kaaryon or aacharan ke sambandh main saadharantaya uplabdh nahin he, chaahe prakaashan aise tathyon or vaktavyon par aadhaarit ho joki satya na ho, jab tak ki padaadhikari yah sthapit na kare ki prakaashan, satya kaa aadar or parvaah na karte hue, kiya gaya tha
 In such a case, it would be sufficient for a member of the defense media or the press to prove that they acted after proper verification of facts, it is not necessary for them to prove that what they have written is true
 parantu jahaan yah siddh hota he ki prakaashan durbhaavna athwa vyakt vair se pravrutt or jhootha he, vahaan bachaav paksh ke liye koi bachaav nahin hoga or nuksaan hetu uttaradaayi hoga
 However, in a case which is not related to the discharge of their duties, a public official gets the same protection as any other citizen
 haalaanki nyaayapalika, sansad or rajya vidhanmandal is niyam kaa apwaad hai kyonki purvavarti isaki avamaanama hetu dand ke adhikaar se surakshit he or uttarvarti samvidhan ke anuchhed 105 or 194 ke antargat vishedhikaron se surakshit he
 The Council has further stated that this does not mean that the Official Secrets Act, 1923 or any similar enactment or provision which has the legal power, cannot control the press or the media
 yah bhi diya gaya he ki aisa koi kanoon nahin he joki press / media par purv niyantran rakhane athwa varjit rakhane kaa rajya athwa iske adhikariyon ko adhikaar detaa ho
 In relation to the public official's claim of privacy, the Council has specified that if the public official's privacy and his personal conduct, habits, personal functions and characteristics of character, which conflict or relate to the proper discharge of his official duty, If there is a conflict between the right to know and to know, then the predecessor should bow to the latter
 haalaanki, vyaktigat niztaa ke maamalon main, joki unki shaskeey dyati ke nirvaah se sambaddh nahin he, saarvajanik padaadhikari ko vahi suraksha milti he joki kisi anya naagarik ko milti he
 This guideline suggests a path of safety and responsibility overall through legal, ethical and ethical problems that everyday newspaper owners, journalists, editors oppose
 morganirdeshika akatya siddhanton kaa sankalan nahin he balki isamen vyapak saamaanya siddhant hai, joki prayek maamle kii paristhiti ko dekhte hue samuchit vivek or anukulan ke saath lagu kiye jate he, to ve vyavsaayik eemaandaaree ke maarg sahit patrakaron ko unke vyavsaay ke sanchaalan ko aatm-sanyamit karne main unki sahaayta karenge
 By no means is it exhausting, nor is it strictly intended to impede the free work of the press
 patrakarita ke staron or press kii swatantraaa donon ke bare main vibhinn vishyon par apane nirnay ke silsile main parishad dwaara viksit kiye gayi kuch brihd siddhanton ko sankshipt rup main nimnanusaar diya gaya he
 Abusive and provocative attacks should not be carried out on sects and individuals
 afvaahon par aadhaarit sampradayik ghatnaon par koi bhi samachar patrakarita niti kaa ulanghan hoga
 Similarly, it would not be correct to report malformed making significant omissions
 jahaan shantipurna or kanoonee tareeke se kisi sampradaay kii sahi shikaayat ko dur karne ke iraade se is ore dhyanakrit karnaa press kaa vaid kaary he, vahiin shikayaton kii khoj / athwa inhen badha chadhaakar nahin dena chahie vishe sp se un shikayaton ko, jinamein sampradayik vaimnasy badhaane kii kshamta ho
 It will be highly beneficial in creating a healthy and peaceful environment if sensational provocative and dangerous headlines are dropped and acts of violence or vandalism are reported in such a way that people's trust in the law and order of the state is not reduced and with it -with this, it has the effect of discouraging and condemning such works
 ek sampradaay ko badnaam karnaa gambhir maamla he or ise ratr-virdohi gatividhi bataanaa ninda hoga or yah patrakarita asangati ke samaan he
 There is no inconsistency in publishing historical facts to warn the present generation against repeating past mistakes even if these mistakes are not of interest to a particular sect
 dharmik sampradaayon ke bare main vaktavy dene main koi aapatti nahin he yadi ye sanyamit bhashaa main diye jate hai or galat athwa badha-chadhaakar nahin diye jate hai
 Some of the principles developed by the Council through its decisions regarding the improper use of journalism are vishwaas main lekar darshaya gaya athwa vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya koi maamla, strot kii sahmati liye bina prakashit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 If the editor feels that the publication is in the public interest, then he should clarify in the appropriate footnote that the relevant statement or discussion was being published even though it was unofficially given
 ek vigyaapan jisamen kuch bhi gaiyr-kanoonee athwa avaidh ho athwa joki sadruchi athwa patrakarita niti athwa auchity ke vipareet ho, prakashit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Due care should be taken to maintain accuracy in relation to citations by newspapers
 jahaan ek samachaarpatr par patrakarita niti ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa he, yah tark ki usne prakaashan band kar diya he, sampadak kaa bachaav nahin hoga kyonki unka aacharan hi shikaayat kaa viy he
 The meaning of interest also varies according to the context
 patrkaar ke liye iskaa arth he ki jise shaleenta athwa auchity ke aadhaar par unhen prakashit nahin karnaa chahie
 Where there is a tendency to incite sexual feelings in a case, its publication in the magazine will be undesirable for the public, young or old
 janaruchi ko baataavaran, paristhiti ke saath samasamyik samaaj main vidyaman ruchi kii dharanaon ke saath parkhaa janaa chahie
 The basic test of obscenity is whether the case is so vulgar that it can spoil or confuse the character
 anya pareekshan yah he ki kya prayukt bhashaa or drishy kaa chitrankan ganda, ashleel, aruchikar athwa kaamuk samajha ja saktaa he
 Whether a story is obscene or not will depend on factors such as the literary or cultural nature of the magazine and the level of social justice
 ek patrika athwa samachaarpatr ke viengat maamle kii pikchar kaa is prashn se sambandh hota he ki kya prakashit kiya gaya maamla janaruchi ke staron se kam he athwa nahin
 One of the test factors of whether a picture is less than public interest will be the nature or purpose of the magazine - whether it is related to art, painting, drug research, or sexual improvisation
 press parishad ne mudran media main ashleel vigyapanon ke badhate hue udaahranon par chintaa vyakt kii
 It was against censorship but before publication, preventive measures for checking any obscene material were supported
 chunki aise adhiktar vigyaapan, vigyaapan agenciyon ke jariye diye jate hai, parishad ne yah mahasoos kiya ki yah kaary kathin nahin hoga yadi ye agenciyaan aise vigyapanon, joki ek ausatan naagarik dwaara parivaar main dekhte hue aapattijanak samajha jaye, ko taiyaar or jari karte samay adhik saavdhaanee or samay baraten
 He felt that the Association of Advertising Agencies of India would be able to play a very important and positive role in the matter as a patron organization of all these advertising agencies and demanded their cooperation in not giving advertisements which would in due time bring the socio cultural values of the country There is a possibility of damage
 parishad ne samachaarpatron se bhi apil kii ki yen vigyaapan daataaon se pratyakshtaya athwa vigyaapan agenciyon se praapt hone vaale vigyapanon kii saavdhaneepurvak jaanch karen or ashleel tathaa aapattijanak samajhe jane vaale vigyapanon ko asweekaar karke aatm sanyam baraten
 He also reiterated the following guidelines made by himself against the objected publication
 samachaarpatron ko aise vigyaapan nahin dene chahie joki ashleel hon athwa mahila ko nagnavastha main darshaate hue purushon kii kaamuktha ko uttejit kare jaise ki vah swayan bikri kii vastu ho
 Whether a photograph is obscene or not should be tested in relation to the three tests, namely 1, kya yah ashleel or aashaaleen he, 2, is it only a piece of pornographic writing, 3, kya is prakaashan kaa uddeshy kevalmaatr aise logon main, jinke bich ise parichaalit karne kaa iraadaa he, tathaa kishoron kii yon bhaawanaaon ko uttejit karke paisa kamanaa he
 In other words, is it a harmful exploitation for commercial gain
 anya sambaddh vichaar yogya viy yah he ki ky tasviir patrika ke vishaygat maamle se sambaddh he
 That is to say, whether its publication art, painting, medicine, research or sexual reform fulfills the pre-contemplation of any social or public purpose
 mul siddhant joki is viy par vibhinn adhinirnyon se nikalataa he, patron ke prakaashan main sampadak ke swanirnay kaa samarthan karata he
 However, they are expected to correct the wrong statement or report on a matter of public nature
 jaanane ke saarvajanik adhikaar ke aadhaar par aam pathak vaid adhikaar kaa daawa kar saktaa he
 In addition, any person who has been made a reference in the publication, can automatically claim the right of reply in the columns of the newspaper
 yadi parishad ko yah adhikaar nahin he ki vah ek samachaarpatr ko pratyuttar prakashit karne ke liye baadhya kare, yah samachaarpatr ko iske viruddh jaanch padtaal kaa vivaran prakashit karne ke nirdesh de sakati he
 Verification of news is necessary before publication, especially when the report contains derogatory or written defamatory surpluses or it can cause communal tension, nor can the circumstances justify the publication of rumors as another class of people
 Can
 jab bhi kisi jhuthe athwa vikrut prakaashan par sampadak kaa dhyanakrit kiya jaataa he, to unhen aavashyak sanshodhan karne chahie
 Under the second exception of Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code, respecting a person or his character in the conduct of public works of a public servant, as far as his character appears in that conduct, nothing else, goodwill It is not defamatory to express opinions in tadnusaar parishad kii raay he ki janajivan par uchit tippaneeyon / ko anuchit nahin kaha ja saktaa parantu yadi koi tathyaatmak vaktavy diye jate hai, to ve satya or sahi hone chahie
 If there is a defamatory element attached, then there will be no goodwill defense in any kind of civil proceedings for damages
 bhartiya press parishad ne lokapriy vyaktiyon ke niztaa ke adhikaar or saarvajanik hit tathaa saarvajanik mahatv kii soochna tak pahunchne ke press ke adhikaar ke madhya santulan praapt karne ke liye morganirdesh banaaye hai
 The heated debate at the national and international level and the Conference of the World Union of Press Councils in Delhi in April 1998 emphasized that there is a need to reconcile the three competing constitutional values in this regard, namely: k, ek vyakti kaa niztaa kaa adhikaar, B, freedom of press and ga, janhit main lokapriy vyaktiyon ke bare main jaanane kaa logon kaa adhikaar
 The council has prepared a report on this matter and has made guidelines as follows - niztaa kaa adhikaar anullaghanneey maanavadhikaar he
 However the degree of privacy varies from position to person and from person to person
 saarvajanik vyakti joki janata ke pratinidhi ke rup main kaary karte hai, privet vyakti ke samaan niztaa kii vahi degree paane kii aashaa nahin kar sakate
 Their work and conduct is in public interest
 janhit, janata kii ruchi se alag rakhaa ja rahaa he, yadi privet bhi kiye jaayen, tab bhi press ke madhyam se logon kii jaankaree main laaye jaayen
 Correspondingly, it is the duty of the press to ensure that information about such actions and conduct of public interest is obtained in the right manner, to be properly verified and subsequently given accurate reports
 laagon kii nigaah se dur kiye kaaryon ke bare main soochna praapt karne ke liye, press se nigaraanee vaale tareeke kii aashaa nahin kii jaati he
 While it is expected that the public will not be harassed, the popular public is also expected to bring more openness in their functioning and press duty to inform the public about the actions of their representatives
 Help the press to complete k samachaarpatr athwa ve log, joki sampadakeey ke rup main isse jude hue hai athwa management main he, par samachaarpatr main abhivyakt kii gayi raay ke liye un par dabaav daalane athwa unhen bhayadohit karne ke iraade se hamalaa press kii swatantraaa main ghor hastkshep he

 The council has issued guidelines and recommended policy framework on various matters related to press and people
 iske atirikt jahaan kahin bhi gambhir sthiti paidaa hui jisamen press se sanyam or saavdhaanee ke saath kaary karne kii aashaa kii gai vahaan parishad ke adhyaksh, vaktavyon ke madhyam se press kaa maargdarshan karte rahe hai
 Whenever well-planned major attacks were carried out, they also reacted sharply through such statements
 1969 main, parishad ne sampradayik sambandhon se sambaddh maamalon par reporting or tippaniyan karne main niyamon or staron ko nirdit karte hue 10-sutri morganirdesh jari kiye
 Without elaborating, it was listed and clarified in the guidelines that what would be objectionable against journalistic justification and policy, therefore, should be avoided
 sanlagnak bi, kha, Looking at the events of Ayodhya again in 1990, the Council issued another 12-point guidelines in light of the new experience, repeating the 1969 guidelines
 parishad ne kaha ki isamen rekhaankit siddhant prashikshan kii avasthaa se lekar media ke prayek str par antarnivit kiye jane chahie
 These principles Annex B-2 specified both the press and the state to do some work and not do anything
 parishad ne pichley varshon main ratrpati, pradhanmantri aadi ke videshi daure par unke saath jane ke liye patrakaron ke chayan, vigyapanon akhabaari kagaz, manyata ke niyamon jaise kuch viyon ke bare main niti ruparekha kaa nirmaan kiya he
 As discussed earlier, the Council, after the decision taken at its meeting in October 1982, gave two compilations of its awards, outlining the awards at the end of the same set of cases, giving principles in violation of journalistic policy and freedom of the press
 Published on the violation

 parishad kaa naitik prabhaav vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The huge increase in the number of complaints from 80 in 1979 to 1075 in 1997, the need, importance and functioning of the council-like organization to control newspapers is a sufficient proof of the confidence expressed by both media personnel and the public in the functioning

 aids and di media par report main media dwaara kuch kaary karne or kuch na karne nirdit kiye gayi or unhen paraamarsh diya gaya ki chhitput samachar se aids avashya hi prachaar kaa lakshya hona chahie
 At the same time, the press must keep in mind that the public interest which can justify the publication of a case under the protection of personal privacy should be a legitimate interest and not an inquisitive or perverse curiosity
 june 1993 kii ek anya report jiskaa shirk pan red snord kalam or talwaar tha, main raksha se sambaddh soochna main adhik khulepan ke ravaiye kaa samarthan kiya gaya
 The latest report of the Council on threats to the media from militant organizations in Jammu and Kashmir recommended immediate dissemination of information at the government level to counter militant propaganda
 report ne media karmiyon ko, joki swatantra ruukh apnaane par ugravadiyon se dhamkiyon kaa saamana karte hai, ko sansthaneey or kshetreey suraksha pradaan karne hetu sarkaar ko bhi paraamarsh diya he
 In the year 1994, the Council formulated a uniform advertising policy for implementation across India
 yah vigyaapan hetu praadhikariyon dwaara namika main darj karne ke liye samachaarpatron ke anumodan ke liye kasuti pradaan karti he
 The idea of the Press Council of India, after considering the question of the desirability or otherwise of publication of the achievements of pre-poll surveys and the purpose to be fulfilled by them, is to allow newspapers to use their platform for manipulation and distortions in elections
 Should not be given and should not allow its own exploitation by the partisan parties
 atah pre parishad kaa paraamarsh he ki hamaare jaise adarsh loktantr main chunaav prakriya kii sangeen sthiti ko dekhte hue samachaarpatron ko sajag rahanaa chahie ki unke bahumoolya manch kaa chunaav ke herpher or vikrumiyon ke liye istemaal na kiya jaye
 Today it is necessary to emphasize this because the alleged pre-poll surveys such as the use of wrong methods as well as the complicated and incisive propaganda on ethnic, religious and moral grounds to confuse and mislead the interested voters and groups The demand for printing media is increasing
 jahaan kai maamalon main sampradayik or rajdrohatmak prachaar kaa pataa lagaana kathin nahin hoga vahiin matdaan purv surveykshan kaa pakshpaati upyog, kabhi-kabhi jaanboojhkar kiya gaya, ko prakat karnaa utana aasaan nahin he
 Therefore, the Press Council suggests that whenever newspapers publish pre-poll surveys, those organizations that have conducted such surveys, individuals and organizations that have conducted the survey, the size-type of the selected sample for the test results
 The method of selection and indicating the possible scope of error in the test result should be given to them in the preamble clearly

 2, iske atirikt matdaan kii tarikhon ke davadol hone par media ko pehle hi ho chuke pasch-matdaan surveykshan dete hue dekha jaataa he
 There is a possibility of influencing the voters where polling is yet to begin
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki chunaav prakriya ko vishuddh rakhaa gaya he or matadaataaon ke mastik ko bahya karkon dwaara prabhavit nahin kiya gaya he, yah aavashyak he ki media antim matdaan tak pasch matdaan surveykshan prakashit na kare
 3, therefore, the Press Council requests the press to follow the following guidelines regarding post-voting
 antim matdaan samaapt hone tak koi bhi samachaarpatr, pasch matdaan surveykshan, chaahe ve kitne bhi sahi hon, prakashit nahin karegaa
 D, Construction of guidelines for financial journalists by Press Council of India bhartiya press parishad ne reportron / vittiya patrakaron / samachaarpatr pratithaanon ko paraamarsh diya he ki ve nakad athwa kisi bhi prakaar ke uphaar / anudaan / riyaayaten / suvidhaayen aadi, jinamein vittiya maamalon par swatantra or nipaksh reporting ke saath samjhauta karne kii sambhaavna ho, na len
 2, the Council observed in its report that financial journalists greatly affect the readers' minds, so it is their responsibility to balance the states, future, financial transactions of a company and give objective views
 inhone avlokan kiya ki kuch companiyon ke samachaarpatron / patrikaon main atyadhik samachar diye jate he kyonki unhone us mudran media ko vigyaapan jari kiye hai
 Sometimes adverse reports are published of companies that do not advertise to newspapers or magazines
 punah jab kisi bhi kaaran se media kisi company / management se khush na ho, to company ke nakaaratmak pahaluon ko ujagar kiya jaataa he, jabaki iske viparaat, kinhi nakaaratmak pahaluon ko prakaash main nahin laayaa jaataa
 Some companies are also known for receiving positive reports from some financial journalists in support of companies, giving them gifts, loans, rebates, primary shares etc
 is ke saath-saath aise galat kaaryon ke virudv janamat banane athwa niveshkon kii shiksha ke liye koi saadhan nahin he
 3, The Council, concerned about malpractices in the regular sector, after detailed discussions with representative financial institutions and journalists, recommended the following guidelines for financial journalists to observe
 1, vittiya patrakaron ko uphaar, rin daure, chhot, praathmik share aadi joki unki pojishan se samjhauta karte hon, athwa samjhaute kii sambhaavna ho, ko sweekaar nahin karnaa chahie
 2, The report about a company should prominently state that the report is based on the information provided by the company's financial sponsors or the company
 3, jab ek company kii vyavastha kaa daura karne ke liye daure pryojit kiye jate hai, report ke lekhak, jinhone daure kaa laabh uthaaya he, ko yah avashya ullekh karnaa chahie ki sambaddh company dwaara daura pryojit kiya gaya tha or yah ki inhone yathasthiti aatithy bhi kiya
 4
 Without verifying the facts from the company, no matter related to the company should be published and the source of such report should also be shown
 5
 ek report, jisane kisi ghotaale kaa pardaafash kiya he athwa kisi hitkar pariyojna ko badhaava dene ke liye report prakashit kii he, ko protsaahit or puraskrit kiya janaa chahie
 6
 a journalist who has a financial interest in shareholdings, stock holdings, etc
 in a company should not report on that company
 7
 patrkaar ko prakaashan hetu pehle se praapt soochna ko apane sage sambadhiyon or doston ke laabh ke liye istemaal nahin karnaa chahie
 8

 The Central Government sent a recommendation in February 1995 to the Press Council for its views on the possible role of visual and printing media in the progress of women
 parishad kii upasmiti ne pramukh film / media carmiyon or anya prasiddh logon se sampark kiya
 Its report was accepted by the Council on 8 January 1996
 mahilaon ke liye maharatr sarkaar kii niti kii siforishein ko pruthankit karte hue tathaa inase sahamat hote hue, parishad ne 17 adhik siforishein kii jinamein se pramukh he mahilaon par atyaachaar ke samachar prakashit kiye jane chahie parantu unhen sansanikhej banaaye
 The efforts of the media should be made without highlighting the positive achievements of women in moral ethics and should be investigated while combating the vulgarity and indecency of teaching towards modernity
 bhartiya press parishad ko, mahilaon kii avmaananaa ke aaropo par laayi jane vaali shikayaton par vichaar karne ko apni ore se praathamikta di jaani chahie or anya morganirdesh aadi banane chahie
 It was emphasized that such a policy document would become profitable only through the association of all sections of the society
 desh main laghu or majhule samachaarpatron kii samasyaon par vichaar karne ke liye parishad ke sadasyon kii ek up-samiti gathit kii gayi thi
 The Subcommittee in its report to the Council, while recognizing the problems faced by small and medium newspapers, made some concrete long-term / short-term recommendations in cases to ensure and promote the development of short and medium newspapers

 The Council considered deeply the provisions of the Press and Book Registration Bill, 1988 and ruled that it was out of the details of its objectives
 inhone vishay se sambandh duusare pres ayog kii siforeeshon ko samuchit rup se lagu nahin kiya
 Although some of the provisions were of a positive nature, some others were full of mischief which resulted in the threat to freedom of the press

 The council said that preventive laws, including broad rights of pre-censorship and confiscation, would suppress the press, give open leeway to rumors and destroy the credibility of the entire print and broadcast media in Jammu and Kashmir and the rest of the country
 parishad kaa vichaar tha ki purv-sensorship sahaj rup se press kii swatantraaa ke viruddh thi
 He recommended that the bill be withdrawn

 vaise bhi jab bhopal main film kaa filmakan shuru hua to katrina caff ne sonia kii tarah sari or shringaar apanaaya tha
 However, the producer of this film Prakash Jha has been denying these things from the beginning

 agali gend baad bhartiya captain amarnath ek batakh barns, jo apane duusare wicket ke liye mila pagabaadha out praapt karne ke liye gir gaya
 The fifth wicket to fall at 198, Mankad himself, who had made a 116 contribution, made history as it was India's first Test century against Australia
 unhone don tallon, wicketiper ek thik 116 ke liye bill johnson kii gend par, dwaara pakadaa gaya tha
 Then the first official was dismissed for 24 to bring some honors to score by tearing and putting the partnership up to 62
 raat bhar barish ballebaaji mushkil bana diya he, or teen wicket saste ke baad, amarnath ghoshit bhale hi bharat 103 ran peeche the
 To counter the difficult situation, Bradman sent his tailors, Duland, Johnson and Johnson
 lekin jab cid barnes 32 par score ke saath gir gaya, vijaden ne ullekh kiya ki breadman chintit mahasoos ho saktaa he
 However, there is, he had no reason to worry, because he and Morris "mastered" the attack well
 ve ek saath 223 kii naabad saajhedaari anubhoot, or jab morris kam se kam 50 kii strike rate se ran banaae, breadman sabhi gati thi
 He reached his century ago and finished unbeaten at 127, making just 169 balls with a strike rate of over 75
 iskaa matlab tha ki uski kaaphi had tak prabhaavshaalee karier main pehali baar kabhi jo use badi sankhya jamaa dekhe the, vah ek bhi test match main do shatak jamaaye tha
 Wisden spoke like this: baari barish raat bhar pich spin karne ke liye or breadman is avasar kabja uttaradaayi banaaya, ghoshit, bharatiyon ko 337 kaa lakshya kii sthapana
 The Indians performed poorly in the second innings with only Gul Mohammed and Kanwar Rai Singh making 28 and 24 runs, making any notable contributions
 singh ne kuch vaasana yahan or vahaan hit de rahi he chaaron ore atak gai he, lekin bharat ke liye durbhaagya se, ve 125 par, ek score jo sambhavit lag rahaa tha jab ve board par sirf 60 ran ke saath apane paksh ke aadhe kho diya muda hua he
 Notable artists for Australia were Bradman, Morris, Johnson, Johnson and Hassett
 bharatiyon mankad or amarnath ke rup main kuch acha vyaktigat pradarshan tha purv, ek acha chautarafa sho daal, jabaki baad 130 ke liye 7 ke ek match daud uthaa
 Match report 223 ran ke baari margin or ek pari chipkaane se haar jane ke baad bharat ab bhi shesh do test jeetne ek shrinkhalaa haar se bachane ke liye ek mauka tha, lekin vah bhi invincibles, jo sab main behatar team thi khilaaf poochne ke liye bahut kuch tha aadar karata he
 The test was the first film trial of the future Australian great, Neil Harvey
 toss australia dwaara jeet liya tha or ek pich he ki ballebaaji ke liye puri tarah se pravaahkeey tha par, breadman toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya
 In the previous match, Morris was bowled by another Australian Centurion, when the scorecard read 20, to fall the first wicket
 uske baad, unke salaami jodidar, cid barnes, or breadman bharatiyon kaa mauka dete hai or phir se kaarywahi niyantrit, duusare wicket ke liye 236 ran par daalane se pehle barns ek "nirdosh" 112 ke liye naash nahin kiya
 He did not offer a single chance in his entire innings except for 61 when he was dropped by the second slip
 breadman ne ek baar phir bhartiya gendbaajon ke bane the, or vah, hasasetat, agle ballebaaj ke saath-saath ne tisare wicket ke liye jode gaye 105 ran se pehle breadman hajaare par gir gaya he, jo ek chakka or 21 chauke nihit apane test karier main duusari baar, ek taanaashaahee or pramukh 201 ke liye ke liye
 Hasett, and Keith Miller added 142 runs to score, aggressively and independently hitting
 unki pramukh or teji se scoring kii hode, hasasetat ke dauraan, jaldi se 128 kaa unka sarvocch score ateet main ghoomte hai or ek shandaar or jujharu 198 ke liye apane raste par acchhee tarah se ho gaya tha isse pehle ki vah saajhedaaron main se baahar bhaag gaya
 The remaining 171 runs of the batting order were overrun by a 6-wicket loss after Miller's dismissal for the fourth wicket
 australia 674, shrinkhalaa main apane ucchtam kul ke ant main out ho gai
 When it was the turn of the Indian batting, they made a shocking start to their innings, losing two wickets for just six runs, but they got 127 runs at the cost of three wickets, albeit from a dangerous position to add
 Fought back
 unke samgr sthiti, 133 ke liye 5, bahut utsahjanak nahin tha, lekin vijay hajaare or dattu fadkar chathe wicket ke liye 188 ran jode
 Tearing also contributed 123 against an Australian attack that had Lindwal Miller, Johnson and Johnson among others
 haalanki, aadmi he jo aakarshan kaa centre tha hajaare, jo shastreey or roodhiwaadee 116 fata, bhartiya nichle kram cromplade se pehle kuch pratirodh pradaan karne ke rup main unke pichley chaar ballebaajon ko keval 20 ran kul tha
 The only other Indian batsmen who really made any impact were Veenu Mankad, who has 49 off 156 balls, which has spread in 139 minutes-2 hours and 19 minutes, and Lala Amarnath, who hit a fast, 46, 47 only
 The ball, which was five hits to the fence
 293 ran ke peeche - haalanki, bharat ko ek majboot australian daura, jo unhen 381 ran par out ho gai thi
 This was a staggering margin of leadership and victory were rare after follow on
 bharatiyon ko bhi badtar is baar ke aasapaas shuru kar diya, board par koi ran par jaldi do wicket khone
 It was then that Hazare played an innings which made a contemporary daily talk as follows: vastav main, pari, to vyapak rup se saraahi ki sab kuch baari pad rahaa tha yahaan tak ki breadman ke 201
 Hazare later recalled in an interview that two of his centuries in the test came from rain, the most prominent memories being of Bradman's second wicket of his tour in the low-scoring Sydney Test
 oktober main boria majumdaar ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main, cricket itihaaskaar ullekh kiya, hajaare ne daawa kiya he ki: It was an incredible feat, considering that Australia's bowling attack was almost as good in their batting
 unki gendbaaji linep kuch taarakeey naamon kaa daawa: kith miller, jo ek vaastavik harfanmaulaa khilaadi balle or gend donon, re lindwal, jo kisi bhi haalat main gendbaaji kii purna swaamitv adhikari karne ke liye kaha gaya tha ke saath bahut acha pradarshan dene main sakasham tha, ek tha jo sahi gendbaaji, chhedak ke saath or gendbaaji par hamalaa, or ian johnson or bill johnson, jo team main donon samaan rup se mahatvapurn cogs the
 This particular innings of Hazare enhanced India's reputation as his, as was well said
 is prakriya main, hajaare breadman, jo pichley pareekshan main hi kiya tha nakal karte
 Hemu Adhikari of his effort series, 51, was supported by the first half-century
 adhikari hajaare bahumoolya samarthan diya or do ballebaajon ko 132 ran kii saajhedaari kii, lekin ant jald hi aayaa jab bhartiya telenders lindwal ke tej ke aage ghutane tech, ke rup main pichley teen wicket chah ran ke liye gir gaya
 The defeat of another innings tended to seal a well-deserved series win in Australia, but with his head emerged high held Hazare due to his personal victory
 haalanki, australian team bharatiyon ke liye bhi acha tha
 Match report paanchaven or antim test match ke ek mara rabar tha, ant main, or is match thos team work main apane vyaktigat pradarshan anuwaad karne ke liye bhartiya team ke liye ek antim avasar ke saath shuru hua
 On the other hand the tourists had already won two consecutive matches against Australia and their team was also called as a unit
 itnaa hi nahin unke captain, udhaaharan ke saath breadman netritv kiya tha, lekin team ke anya sadasyon ko bhi khud ko samaan rup se maahir sabit kar diya
 So the Indians who saw this match were playing with their respect at stake
 sikke ke saath breadman kii kismat, shrinkhalaa main jari toss ke rup main vah toss jeeta or paanch main se chauthaa avasar ke liye toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya
 a 48-run partnership from Australian Sid Barnes was brilliantly run out by the openers official
 hameshaa kii tarah, breadman se ek-neeche par ballebaaji karne ke liye baahar aayaa or bill brown ke saath-saath, vah kuch durbhagyapurna australia ke liye hua pehle tisare wicket ke liye 92 ran jode
 He retired at 140 / 1 when Bradman learned that he had a rib torn and was unable to play independently
 brown is sthiti se aprabhavit rahaa tha or ek teen ghante pachchis minute 99 khudi hui, 216 gend main
 Then he was also out, but the other Australian batsman scored
 sam logton, apane karier kii shuruyaat kar rahi he, ek 155 gend main 80, lindwal, tallon, len johnson, or bill johnson vishaal scoreline ke liye yogadan diya ran banaae
 However, the chief minister's honor went to nineteen-year-old, four-month-old Neil Harvey, with the help of a mighty 153 Musselds, one to five and eleven squares
 unhone 78 pratham din samaapt ho gaya, or phir 7 farvari, 1948 ko apana shatak maaraa
 He was promoted to No
5 in the match and this was effectively a reward just for his promotion
 unhone kaha ki australia, ek ricard he ki abhi bhi khadaa ke liye sabase kam umr ke soobedaar hone kaa archi jackson ke record ko paar kiya
 His innings was completely innocent except for the chance which he gave the Indian fielders shortly before he was dismissed
 sarvate 3 / 1 main pehle wicket ke liye gir gaya jab bhartiya ballebaaji karnaa shuru kiya
 However, Mankad and Adhikari batted well to bail India out of the crisis, before adding 124 for the second wicket before the official fell to 38, made in 202 balls with a solitary boundary
 apane pichley match hirogiri se taaja hajaare mankad ke saath ballebaaji ke liye baahar aayaa tha or ve 79 par daal se pehle mankad shrinkhalaa, ek acchhee tarah se taiyaar kii jaati he, paanch ghante 111 kii apni duusari sadi ke liye gir gaya
 Hazare then fell for a fifth wicket after a fine 74
 fadkar, jo 56 nahin banaaya baahar, ke alaava anya ballebaajon ko bahut lambey samay tak jivit nahin tha, ke rup main bharat kii ballebaaji ek baar phir anna hajaare or mankad ne ek majboot punaruddhar ke baad ek langadaa pradarshan ke liye muda
 In the end, India scored 244 and by this time neither Mankad chased in his second innings, nor did Hazare save his neck as his batting put out a weak performance to go all 67
 adhikari sheersh scorer 17 ke saath he, lekin uski "pratirodh" ke alaava anya koi anya bhartiya ballebaaj kaaphi krij par kabja he or ek drow ke baahar pisane main kaamyaab rahe
 Two Australian debuts, Doug Rynn and Lane Johnson had a field day, picking up twelve wickets between them
 johnson 6 / 74, duusari pari main 3 / 8 sahit le liya he, jabaki ring 6 / 120 liya
 Johnson went on to play only one more test after that, while the ring went on to become a useful all-rounder for the Australian team
 yah "kaaran ke saath, maichon main se adhikansh main biimaar bhagya kii shikaayat karte hai
 "an unhappy tour has been overshadowed for the Indian team, who could
 is daure ke liye sabase acha australia ko bharat ke pehle daure ke liye kiya ja rahaa he or yah bhi ghar main breadman ke antim test siries or uski duusari aakhri shrinkhalaa hone ke liye yaad kiya ja saktaa he
 It was probably because of this that the Indians were really eager to see Bradman play
 haalanki bharat daure par score ke liye kam se kam sau chaar baar ekadam, unke ballebaaj acchhee tarah se vyaktigat rup se pradarshan kiya
 In fact, Dattu Tadkar, who cracked a century in the fourth Test, as well as three fifties, led the average
 vijay hajaare ek hi match main do shatak ke baad ek sansani ban gaya
 Veenu Mankad has scored two centuries, in the third and fifth Tests, however, it was a veteran campaigner and his team captain Lala Amarnath, a rapid failure for the team's heavy losses
 kaagaj par, yah ek majboot bhartiya team he jo mankad, hajaare, amarnath or sies naidu kii pasand bhi shaamil tha
 But these players have never done it collectively, which was what the Australian team did
 don breadman sanchit pehle se behatar chalaata he, or 178
75 kii is shrinkhalaa main unka ausat lagbhag apane karier ausat ke dohare tha
 He said the series was the highest run scorer
 jabaki re lindwal, 18 wicket ke saath shrinkhalaa sarvaadhik wicket lene vaale gendbaaj tha
 Vijay Hazare scored 429 runs for India and Lala Amarnath took 13 wickets in six innings
 haalanki, balle se kharaab score ke amarnath kii string bharat ek anya visheshgy ballebaaj, jo kam se kam haar kaa margin kam ho saktaa tha kii sevaaon kii laagat
 Australia's, on the other hand, fully coordinated as a unit: their batsmen piled up big scores and their bowlers never got over 400 runs in the entire Test series, through the Indian lineup
 The part is clear
 iske alaava, is shrinkhalaa bhi bharat main ek gendbaaj jo wicket niyamit rup le saktaa he or ran-pravaah ko niyantrit kar sake kii ghaataa badhaayaa
 Don Bradman said: yah raay thi ki is taraf bharat ke sabase majboot khilne ke liye kii gai thi, lekin rusi modi, vijay marchent, mushtak ali or fazal mahmud daure ke sab yaad kiya, jo bharat aapng, kyonki modi or vyapaaree pichon or satahon ke sabhi prakaar par bharat ke sabase vishwasaneey ballebaaj the
 He also lost a strike bowler, who would go on to become Fazal Mehmood for Pakistan
 balle ke saath safalataa kii amarnath kii kami ke daure, jahaan unhone 58
10 kii ausat se 1162 ran banaae hai main apane pradarshan se ek vichlan tha, or 30 wicket liye
 228 In a tour match he made against Victoria in Australia, was described as "one of the greatest ever played" by Bill Woodfulls 1932 Victor Richardson, a recognized member of the Bodyline side
 unki captaini main bhi lagaataar parivartan vah ballebaaji kram main banaaya ke liye aalochana kii gai he karne ke liye kaha gaya tha, lekin sabhi khilaadiyon ko sarvasammati se sambandh ke liye sahmati vyakt kii he ki uskaa prabandhan thik tha suchit kiya gaya
 Bradman also wrote of his captaincy thus, describing an incident when he was playing for the Australian XI against India in first-class matches, when he was playing for 99, and for bowling Amarnath bowling at Gogumal Kishinchand Brought hajaare, mankad or fadkar vijaden dwaara bhajan die gaye the
 Wisden said that Mankad proved his credentials as the best all-rounder of his generation
 unke baayen haath ke spin daure par use 61 wicket le aayaa
 Hazare's feat of hitting for two back-to-back centuries in the Adelaide Test was described as the best performance of the series
 unhone kaha ki keval duusare daure par 1000 ran score karne ke liye bhartiya tha
 Tattu was hailed as the "fastest" Indian bowler
 lekin 52
33 ke saath bharat ke liye ausat topping ke bare main unki uplabdhi par ek "swaagat aashcharya" hone ke rup main ullekh kiya gaya tha

 22 farvari hadtaal kaa charam bindu tha, jab 78 jahaaj, 20 tateey pratishthan or 20,000 nausainik isamen shaamil ho chuke the
