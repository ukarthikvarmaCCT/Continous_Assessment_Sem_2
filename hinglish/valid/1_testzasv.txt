 The decision to partition Bengal was announced on 19 July 1905 by Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India
 ek muslim bahul praant kaa srijan karne ke uddeshy se hi bharat ke bengal ko do bhaagon main baant diye jane kaa nirnay liya gaya tha
 The partition took effect from 16 October 1905
 itihaas main ise bangbhang ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 It was a part of the British "divide - rule" policy
 at: iske virodh main 1908 i
 main sampoorn desh main `bang-bhang' aandolan shuru ho gaya
 The eastern and western parts of Bengal were reunited in 1911 due to pressure from the Indian people on both sides due to high level political unrest caused by this division
 bengal praant kaa kshetrafal 489,500 varg kilometre or jansankhya 8 karod se zyada thi
 East Bengal was geographically and almost isolated from West Bengal due to less communication means
 1836 main, upree praanton ko ek leftinent governor ke shashan ke antargat kar diya gaya or 1854 main governor general-in-council ko bengal ke pratyaksh prashasan se mukt kar diya gaya
 Assam was separated from Bengal, including Sylhet, in 1874 to form a separate chief-commissioner, and later in 1898 Lushai Hills was also included
 bengal jaise bade or itani adhik aabaadi vaale praant kaa prabandhan bahut kathin tha
 The partition of Bengal was first thought in 1903
 chittagong tathaa dhaka or maimansingh ke jilon ko bengal se alag kar assam praant main milaane ke atirikt prastaav bhi rakhe gaye the
 Similarly, Chota Nagpur was also to be merged with the Central Province
 san 1903 main hi congress kaa bhi 19vaan adhiveshan madras main hua tha
 On the same occasion, its Chairman Mr
 Lalmohan Ghosh, in his address criticized the reactionary policy of the government, reported imminent mutilation on an all-india platform
 unhone kaha ki is prakaar kaa ek shadyantr chal rahaa he
 The government officially published the idea in January of 1904 and in February Lord Curzon made official visits to assess the public opinion on the partition in the eastern districts of Bengal
 unhone pramukh hastiyon ke saath paraamarsh kiya or dhaka, chatgaanv tathaa maimansingh main bhaashan dekar vibhaajan par sarkaar ke rukh ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya
 Henry John Stedman Cotton, who was Chief Commissioner of Assam from 1896 to 1902, opposed the idea
 congress ke agle adhiveshan main sabhapati pad se bolte hue sar henry coton ne bhi yah kaha ki yadi yah bahaanaa he ki itane bade praant ko ek rajyapal sanbhaal nahin saktaa to yaa to bombai or madras kii tarah bengal kaa shashansutra saprishad rajyapal ke sipurd ho yaa banglaa bhashiyon ko alag karke ek praant banaaya jaae
 In those days Bengal province also included Bihar and Orissa
 par british sarkaar ne na to congress kii parvaah kii, na janamat kii
 The then Viceroy and Governor General Lord Curzon tried to convince the people in the Land Holders Association or Zamindar Sabha that vangabhang would only benefit
 vah swayan purv bengal main bhi gaye, par mutthi bhar musalamaanon ke atirikt kisi ne is prastaav kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 The then Nawab of Dhaka, reputed among the Muslims, also opposed it in the first charge
 1905 main 16 oktober ko bharat ke tatkaaleen waisarai lard karjan dwaara bengal kaa vibhaajan kiya gaya
 The division was encouraged for administrative tasks, Bengal being almost as large as France, with a population much larger than France
 aisa sochaa gaya ki purvi kshetra upekshit or uchit rup se shasit nahin tha
 With the division of the province, better administration could be established in the eastern region, so that the people there would ultimately benefit from school and employment opportunities
 haalaanki, vibhaajan kii yojana ke peeche anya uddeshy bhi chhipe the
 Bengali Hindus were pioneers in the political movement for greater participation in governance, so now their position was weakened due to the increase in the dominance of the Muslims in the past
 Both Hindus and Muslims opposed the partition
 After partition, however, an almost anti-british movement prevailed at the national level, including non-violent and violent protests, boycotts and even the assassination of the governor of the new province of West Bengal
 prabal saarvajanik virodh ke baavjood 20 july 1905 ko vangbhang ke prastaav par bharat sachiv kaa thappa lag gaya
 The Rajshahi, Dhaka and Chittagong Commissioners were merged with Assam to form a province, which was named as Poorvang and Assam, and the rest, ie Presidency and Vardhaman Commissioners, Bihar, Udha and some base
 is avasar par hinduon or musalamaanon ko yah kahkar ladaane kii cheshtaa kii gai ki is vibhaajan se musalamaanon ko phayda he kyonki purvavang or assam main unheen kaa bahumat rahegaa
 The Nawab of Dhaka had earlier protested, but he became in his favor when he became disenchanted
 sar jojeff bamfield fuller purvavang or assam ke nae leftinant governor bane
 He is said to have said openly in many places that Hindus and Muslims are his two bibis, of which Muslims are his favorites
 is kathan kaa aashay spasht tha
 Vangabhang was not intended to facilitate administration, as it was claimed, but rather had two clear objectives, one to fight a Hindu Muslim and the other to hurt the newly awakened Bengal
 yadi gaharaai se dekha jaae to yaheen se pakistan kaa bijaropan hua
 One of the resolutions passed in the 1906 session of the Muslim League was also that vangabhang is good for Muslims and those who agitate against it do wrong things and they harm Muslims
 baad ko chalakar lig ke 1908 ke adhiveshan main bhi yah prastaav paarit hua ki congress ne vangbhang ke virodh kaa jo prastaav rakhaa he, vah sweekruti ke yogya nahin
 The new province included the hill states of Tripura, Chittagang Mandal, Dhaka and Rajshahi and the Malda district was merged into Assam province
 bengal ko na keval in bade purvi pradeshon ko chhodana padaa, balki paanch hindi bhashi rajyon ko bhi madhya praant ke liye ganvaana padaa tha
 On the west side, it was awarded Sambalpur and five small Oriya-speaking states from the Central Province
 bengal ke paas141,580 varg mile kshetrafal or paanch karod chalis lakh kii jansankhya hi bachi thi, jisamen chaar karod bees lakh hindu or nabbe lakh muslim the
 The new province was named East Bengal and Assam respectively, with Dhaka, the capital of East Bengal, and Chittagong, the subordinate headquarters of Assam
 iskaa kshetrafal 106,540 varg mile tha or jansankhya teen karod das lakh thi, jisame ek karod assi lakh muslim or ek karod bees lakh hindu the
 There was a Legislative Council and a two-member Revenue Board for administration and the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court was not changed
 sarkaar ne ingit kiya ki purvi bengal or assam ke bich ek sahi dhang se nirdhaarit pashchimi seemaa hogi or suparibhaashit bhugolic, nrikul vigyaani, bhashiya evam saamaajik visheshtaayen hongi
 The Government of India publicized its final decision with the accepted resolution of 19 July 1905 and the partition of Bengal came into force from 16 October of the same year
 1911 main radd kiye jane se purv, vibhaajan bamushkil aadhe dashak tak chal paaya tha
 However, the UK policy behind Partition was Divide et Impera, which continued to influence the reorganized province
 1919 main, musalamaanon or hinduon ke liye alag-alag chunaav vyavastha sthapit kii gayi
 Prior to this, many members of both communities advocated national unity for all Bengalis
 ab, alag-alag samudaayon ne apane-apane rajnatik mudde viksit kar liye
 Muslims also dominated the Legislature on the strength of their overall numerical strength, which ranged between two crore twenty lakh and two crore eight million
 rashtriya str par hinduon or musalamaanon ke liye do swatantra rajyon ke nirmaan kii maang uthne lagi, adhikansh bengali hindu ab hindu bahumat kshetra or muslim bahumat kshetra ke aadhaar par hone vaale bengal ke bantwaare kaa paksh lene lage
 Muslims now wanted to make the entire province a part of the Muslim state, Pakistan
 1947 main bengal duusari baar, is baar dharmik aadhaar par, vibhajit hua
 It became East Pakistan
 haalaanki, 1971 main pashchimi pakistani sainya shashan ke saath ek safal mukti yuddh ke baad purvi pakistan bangladesh naam kaa swatantra rajya ban gaya
 There was bloodshed in both the divisions of Bengal
 isane ek bada raajnneetik sankat paidaa kiya
 Muslims in East Bengal believed that a separate region would provide them more opportunities for education, employment, etc
, whereas the people of West Bengal did not like this partition and a large amount of nationalist literature was produced during this time
 bhartiya rashtriya congress dwaara kiye gaye virodh kaa netritv sar henry jon stedman coton ne kiya jo purv main assam ke mukhya ayukta the, parantu karzan adig rahe
 Later, Cotton, now a liberal MP from East Nottingham, successfully campaigned for the removal of Sir Bemfield Fuller, the first lieutenant-governor of East Bengal
 1906 main rabindranath tagore ne amar shonar bangla kii rachana kii jo bantwaare kaa virodh karne waalon kaa raily naaraa tha, vah kaaphi baad, 1972 main bangladesh kaa raashtragan ban gaya
 Due to these political protests, both parts of Bengal were reunited in 1911
 ek nayaa bantwaaraa hua jisane praant ko dharmik ke sthaan par bhashaai aadhaar par baanta ja sakaa, jisase hindi, oriya or asamiya bhashi kshetron ko nayi prashasnic ikaayiyon banane ke liye alag kiya gaya
 Simultaneously, the administrative capital of British India was moved from Calcutta to New Delhi
 haalaanki, muslimon or hinduon ke bich kaa takaraav nae kanoonon kii utpatti ke rup main parinit hua jisase donon virgon kii rajnatik aavashyaktaaen santusht kii ja saken
 There was a heavy movement outside Bangal against Bangabhang
 is andolan main desh ke prasiddh kaviyon or sahityakaron ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 This movement gave new heights to the song Vande Mataram of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay
 us samay bengal ko baant dene kaa angreji kuchakr to tutaa hi, saare desh main or videshon main ise asaadhaaran khyaati mili
 Countries like German and Canada were also affected by it
 kamagatamaru naamak jahaaj ke jhande par 'vande maataram' ankit kiya gaya tha
 From then on till the Salt Satyagraha of 1930 and the 'quit India' movement of 1942, 'vande Mataram' was the most inspiring and beloved slogan of young freedom fighters who emerged from all the communities

 After touching the land of Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai, the hijackers forced the aircraft to land in Kandahar, Afghanistan
 apartaaon ne 176 yatriyon main se 27 ko dubai main chhod diya lekin ek ko buree tarah chaaku se maaraa or kai anya ko ghayal kar diya
 India's lack of knowledge about the Taliban rule in Afghanistan made negotiations between the Indian authorities and the hijackers difficult
 taliban ne bhartiya vishesh sainya balon dwaara vimaan par dhaava bolne se rokane kii koshish main apane sashastr ladaakon ko apahrit vimaan ke paas tainaat kar diya
 The hijacking lasted for seven days and ended after India released three Islamic terrorists - Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Maulana Masood Azhar

 taliban dwaara sandigdh bhoomika nibhaaye jane kii vyapak rup se ninda kii gayi thi or iske baad yah bharat evam taliban ke bich sambandhon kii samaapti kaa kaaran bana
 The aircraft carried 178 passengers, most of whom were Indian nationals who were returning to India after a vacation in Nepal
 indian airlines flit 814 kaa apharan shuukravaar, 24 disambar 1999 ko bhartiya maanak samay lagbhag 05:30 baje vimaan ke bhartiya hawaii kshetra main pravesh ke kuch hi samay baad kar liya gaya tha
 According to the Indian government, the identity of the kidnappers was as follows: isi-814 par maujuud mukhya flit atendent anil sharma ne baad main bataaya ki ek nakaabposh, chashmadhari aadmi ne vimaan ko bam se uda dene kii dhamkee di thi or captain devi sharan ko "pashchim kii ore udaan bharne" kaa aadesh diya tha
 The hijackers wanted Captain Sharan to take the plane over Lahore via Lucknow but Pakistani authorities immediately refused to allow it as they were wary of linking up with terrorists
 iske alaava eendhan bhi paryaapt nahin tha
 Captain Sharan told the hijackers that they would have to land in Amritsar, India
 amritsar main captain sharan ne vimaan main dubaara eendhan bharne kaa anurodh kiya
 However, the Disaster Management Group in Delhi directed the officials at the Amritsar airport to ensure that the aircraft was stationary, where armed personnel of the Punjab Police were already present for the effort
 unhen nai dilli se sweekruti nahin mili thi
 a fuel tanker was eventually dispatched and instructed to cease access to the aircraft
 jaise hi tanker vimaan kii ore bhaaga, hawaii yatayaat niyantran ne payalat ko dhimaa karne kaa radio sandesh bheja or tanker turant ruk gaya
 The sudden halt thus increased suspicion of the hijackers and forced them to immediately take the aircraft away from the air traffic control without clearance
 tanker vimaan se kuch hi feet kii duuri par rah gaya tha
 The aircraft requested an emergency landing in Lahore, Pakistan due to the extremely low fuel level
 pakistan ne is dar se anurodh ko thukraa diya ki aatankwaadiyon ke saath unke desh kaa naam joda ja saktaa tha
 Pakistan also shut down its air traffic services, thus effectively managing the entire Pakistan airspace for Indian Airlines flight and all the lights at Lahore airport were switched off
 atisi se koi bhi madad nahin milaane se captain sharan ne apni drishyaatmak prerana par bharosa kiya or vahaan utarana shuru kar diya jise unhone ek ranve sochaa tha or baad main paaya ki yah keval ek acchhee roshni vaali sadak thi or phir samay par vimaan ko uda le gaye
 After realizing that the only other option for the aircraft was to be dashed to the ground, the Lahore airport turned on its lights and allowed the aircraft to land
 lahore hawaii adde ke adhikariyon ne vimaan main indhan bharaa or bhartiya maanak samay 22:32 baje ise lahore chhodane ke liye anumati de di
 In addition, Pakistani authorities turned down the IC-814 pilot's request to unload some of the passengers' women and children
 vimaan ne dubai ke liye udaan bhari jahaan badanaseeb vimaan main savaar 27 yatriyon ko chhod diya gaya
 The kidnappers also left a badly injured 25-year-old Indian male, Ripon Katyal, who was stabbed several times by the kidnappers
 baad main ripan ne apni choton ke aage ghutane tech die or apharan kaa ekmaatr mritak vyakti ban gaya
 The hijacked aircraft left for Kandahar International Airport immediately after these passengers were released

 Since India did not recognize the Taliban-regime, it sent an officer from its High Commission in Islamabad to Kandahar
 The negotiation process was complicated by India's lack of prior contact with the Taliban-government
 haalanki taliban kaa iraadaa tab andeh ke daayre main aa gaya jab iske sashastr ladaakon ne apahrit vimaan ko gher liya
 The Taliban maintained that military forces were deployed in an attempt to prevent the hijackers from killing or injuring hostages, but some analysts believe this was done to halt the Indian military operation against the hijackers
 apartaaon ne shuru main bhartiya jelon main kaid 35 islamic ugravadiyon kii rihaai or 200 million america dollar nagad kii maang kii thi lekin bhartiya vaartakar unki maang ko teen kaidiyon kii rihaai tak kam karne ke liye apartaaon ko manaane main kaamyaab rahe

 Apart from this, animals recover in a few days
 isi prakaar maatra ko baraabar badhaate jate hai jab tak ki jantu pratham maatra se kai sau guni adhik maatra nahin sahan kar letaa
 By this time, a large amount of antibody has formed in the blood of the animal

 This type of immunity is also sustainable
 upyukt prakaar se kshamta utpann karne ke baad us jantu ke rakt se serum pruthak kar, rasinic vidhiyon dwaara shuddh karne ke pashchaat, uskaa chikitsa ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 When this serum is injected into the patient's body, passive immunity is produced in it, that is, due to the antibodies present in the serum, his body becomes immune, but the patient's body does not produce immunity
 pratiraksha utpann karanevaale prativish or pratipind duusare sharir dwaara utpann hote hai

 Lump suppressor genes are genes that inhibit the cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells
 ganth kaa shaman karne vaale jin aksar cancer ko badhaava dene vaale anuvanshik parivartanon ke dwaara aksham ho jate hai
 Typically, many genes need to be transformed to convert a normal cell into a cancer cell
 vibhinn jinomik parivartanon ke liye ek vividh vargeekaran yojana he, jo cancer koshikaon ke utpaadan main yogadan kar sakati he
 Most of these changes are mutations, or changes in nucleotide sequencing of genomic DNA

 cancer rogajanan main adhi-anuvaanshiki kaa siddhant he ki DNA main gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartan jin abhivyakti main parivartan kar dete hai
 In general, oncogenes are silent, for example due to DNA methylation
 is methilikaran main kshati onkosin kii vipathi abhivyakti ko prerit karti he, jo cancer rogajanan kaa kaaran he
 Known systems of over-genetic transformation include DNA methylation and methylation or acetylation of linked histone proteins at specific positions on the chromosomal DNA
 chikitsa ke varg jo HDAC sandamak or DNA mithail transfarej sandamak ke rup main jane jate hai, ve cancer koshika main adhi-anuvaanshik sanketan ko punah niyamit kar sakate hai
 Oncogenes promote cell growth in many ways
 kai hormone bana sakate hai, yah koshikaon ke bich ek rasinic sandeshvahak hota he jo samasutri vibhaajan ko prerit karata he, jiskaa prabhaav grahi utak yaa koshika ke sanket pargaman par nirbhar karata he
 In other words, when a hormone receptor is stimulated on a recipient cell, the signal is transported from the cell surface to the nucleus of the cell, affecting some changes in gene transcription regulation at the central level
 kuch onkosin khud sanket pargaman tantra kaa bhaag hote hai, yaa koshikaon or utakon main sanket grahi kaa ek bhaag hote hai, is prakaar se aise hormonon kii samvedansheeltaa ko niyantrit karte hai
 Oncogenes often produce mitosis, or engage in the transcription of DNA in protein synthesis, which makes proteins and enzymes, these proteins and enzymes are responsible for the production of products and biochemicals with which cells interact and which Cells use
 aadya-onchogin main utparivartan, jo saamanyatya onchogin ke sthir samakaksh hai, unki abhivyakti or kriya ko sanshodhit kar sakate hai or utpaada protein kii kriya yaa maatra ko badhaate hai
 When this happens, proto-oncogenes become oncogenes and this infection disturbs the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, allowing uncontrolled cell growth
 chaahe sambhav bhi ho jaye to bhi jinom main se aadya-onkosin ko hataa kar cancer ki sambhaavna ko kam nahin kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki ve jeev kii vruddhi, marammat or samasthaapan ke liye jatil hote hai
 This only happens when they mutate and the signs of growth become excessive

 The function of such genes is to control the progression of the cell cycle for DNA repair, which prevents the mutation from being transferred to the daughter cell
 p53 protein, jo sabase zyada adhyayan kiye gaye gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon main se ek he, ek pratilekhan kaarak he jo hypoxia or parabangnee vikiran kshati sahit kai koshikeey tanavkaariyon ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 The knotting function of its knot has not been well understood, except for about half of all cancers involved in the p53 conversion
 spasht rup se p53 ke do kaary hai: ek pratilekhan kaarak ke rup main ek nabhikeey bhoomika or doosraa koshika chakra, koshika vibhaajan or apopatosis viniman main koshika dravyi bhoomika
 According to the Warburg hypothesis, glycolysis is the preferred use of energy for the growth of cancer
 p53 shwasan se glycolitic path ko sthanantaran kaa niyaman karata he
 However, a mutation can itself damage the knotting gene by "closing it" or the signaling pathway that activates it, the invariable consequence of which DNA repair is disrupted or inhibited
 : Accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage definitely causes cancer
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jeenon ke utparivartan jo janan str koshikaon main utpann hote hai, ve santati main sthanantarit ho jate hai or agali pidhiyon main cancer kii sambhaavna ko badhaa dete hai
 Members of these families have increased such incidence and this has decreased the latency of multiple tumors

 Typically, oncogenes are effective, as they involve the action-of-gain mutation, while mutated tumor sedatives are ineffective, as they involve the action-of-loss mutation
 har koshika main samaan jin kii do pratilipiyaan hoti hai, inamen se prayek pratilipi abhibhavak se praapt kii jaati he or adhikansh maamalon ke antargat ek vishesh proto-onkosin kii keval ek pratilipi main kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan, us jin ko ek vaastavik onkosin banane ke liye paryaapt hota he
 On the other hand, the function-of-loss mutation needs to occur in both copies of the knot suppressor gene to make the gene completely dysfunctional
 haalanki, aise maamle hai jinamein gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii ek utparivartit pratilipi anya junglee-prakaar pratilipi ko kriyaaheen bana detii he
 This phenomenon is called dominant negative effect and is observed in many p53 mutations
