 The history of the Olympic Games is very old
 pracheen olympic khelon kaa aayojan 1200 saal purv yoddha-khilaadiyon ke bich hua tha
 In the old times the games evolved with competition between warriors during peaceful time intervals

 The warrior competitor, the best performing of these, used to get his stamina in the games

 It was named Olympic because of the sport played on Mount Olympia

 vaidic sanskrit 2000 isapurv se lekar 600 isapurv tak boli jane vaali ek hind-arya bhashaa thi
 It was the ancestral language of Sanskrit and a very close child of the primitive indo-iranian language
 us samay farsi or sanskrit kaa vibhaajan bahut nayaa tha, isliye vaidic sanskrit or avastai bhashaa ek-duusare ke bahut qareeb hai
 Vedic Sanskrit is the oldest certified language of the indo-iranian language branch of the indo-european language-family
 hinduon ke pracheen veda dharmagranth vaidic sanskrit main likhe gaye hai
 The Vedic Sanskrit words and pronunciation have been preserved long before the introduction of writing in the region due to the thousands of years old tradition of strict regular sounds like shrout in the Indian subcontinent
 vedon ke adhyayan se dekha gaya he ki vaidic sanskrit bhi sainkadon saalon ke kaal main badalati gai
 The Vedic Sanskrit of the Rigveda, called the Rigvedic Sanskrit, is the oldest form of all
 panini ke niyamikaran ke baad kii shastreey sanskrit or vaidic sanskrit main kaafii antar he isliye vedon ko mul rup main padhane ke liye sanskrit hi siikhnaa paryaapt nahin balki vaidic sanskrit bhi seekhni padhati he
 Scholars who learn Avastai Persian also have to learn Vedic Sanskrit because Avastai texts are less left and learning Vedic gives a more detailed understanding of that language
 loukik sanskrit-sahitya kaa vaidic sahitya se anek prakaar kaa bhed paaya jaataa he
 Vedic literature is purely religious and contains the seeds of all cosmic elements
 loukik sanskrit sahitya pradhan rup se dharmik-dharmamanirpeksh he athwa dharm main ise lok-paralok se hi sambandhit kaha ja saktaa he
 In this literature, branches of epics, Puranas and other poetic dramas, ornamentation, philosophy, sutras, method or rules, art, Vastushastra, medicine, mathematics, machines, industry texts and other various disciplines are also found
 loukik sahitya kii bhashaa tathaa vaidic sahitya kii bhashaa main bhi antar paaya jaataa he
 The word form and metallicity of the two are different in many ways
 vaidic sanskrit ke rup keval bhinn hi nahin hai apitu anek bhi hai, vishishtatya ve rup jo kriya roopon tathaa dhaatuon ke swaroop se sambandhit hai
 In this regard, the following are some important differences of the two literatures: shabdarup kii drushti se - udaahranarth, loukik sanskrit main keval aise rup banate hai jaise devah janaah 
 Whereas in Vedic Sanskrit, the forms 'dewasah', 'janamah' are also formed
 isi prakaar, prathama tathaa dwitiya vibhakti bahuvachan main ‘vishwani’ rup vaidic sahitya main ‘vishwa’ bhi ban jaataa he
 In the third plural, in the Vedic Sanskrit, 'devai' is found along with this form 'devebhih'
 isi prakaar saptami vibhakti ekvachan main 'vyomni' athwa 'vyomani' in roopon ke saath-saath vaidic sanskrit main ‘vyoman’ yah rup bhi praapt hota he
 In Vedic and temporal Sanskrit, there is a special difference between creations and metallics
 vaidic sanskrit is vishay main kuch adhik samrudh he tathaa usamen kuch or roopon ko uplabdhi hoti he jabaki loukik sanskrit main kriya padon kii avasthaa bataane vaale aise keval do hi lakaar hai : lot or vidhiling joke latprakruti arthath vartmaankaal kii dhaatu se banate hai
 For example, both Pathatu and Pathet are formed from Patha
 vaidic sanskrit main kriyaapadon kii avasthaa ko dyotit karne vaale do or adhik lakaar hai : let lakaar evam nishedhaatmak lulkaar in chaaron avasthaaon ke dyotak lakaar vaidic sanskrit main keval lat prakruti se hi nahin banate hai kintu lit prakruti or lu prakruti se bhi banate hai
 Thus metallics are highly abundant in Vedic Sanskrit
 iske atirikt lin pratyay sambandhi bhed vaidic sanskrit main paye jate hai jaise minimsi bhi prayukt hota he parantu loukik sanskrit main 'minimahi' prayukt hota he
 As far as other forms made of metal are concerned, only one 'tumun' is found in the cosmic Sanskrit whereas in Vedic Sanskrit, about a dozen forms are found such as Gantvae, Gamadhai, Jeevasai, Datavai etc
 punasch, loukik sanskrit aage chalakar adhikadhik kritrim athwa subaddh hoti gai he or iske udhaaharan hamensubandhu or banbhatta ke gadhykavyon main prayukt bhayaavah samaason main milte hai
 In this art, he is excelled by other prose of his field
 kuch vaidic shabd loukik sanskrit main aprapya hai or kuch naye shabdon kaa udbhav bhi ho gaya he
 For example, the use of the Vedic word 'apas' in the sense of 'work' has disappeared in secular Sanskrit
 loukik sanskrit main prayukt ‘parivaar’ shabd vaidic sanskrit main anuplabdh he
 This is its specialty in Vedic and temporal Sanskrit
 shabdaarth vigyaan kii drushti se kuch shabdon main ek vishisht parivartan hua he jaise ‘ritu’ jiskaa vaidic sanskrit main arth he ‘shakti’ or loukik sanskrit main uskaa arth 'yajna' ho gaya he
 In Vedic Sanskrit there were sounds of 'f' and 'kh' which were lost in later Sanskrit
 isamen 'kh' ke uccharan par dhyaan den kyonki yah 'kha' se bahut bhinn he, or 'karaab' or 'khaas' jaise shabdon main milti he
 In modern times there is a misconception that the sounds of 'f' and 'kh' are foreign in Sanskrit-tradition
 vargeekaran kii drushti se 'fa' ko 'upadhmaneey' or 'kh' ko 'jihvamooleey' kaha jaataa he
 The sound of 'B' was pronounced in Visarga before the Aghosha Kantya Varnas
 bhashaa main parivartan ke atirikt donon saahitiyon main kuch or bhinnataayen prapya hai: Later, we also see a change in the system of verses
 vaidic chand jagati, trishtubh, anushtubh to loukik sanskrit main sarvatha anuplabdh he
 While the verses of cosmic Sanskrit, Upendravajra, Shikharini etc
 are completely inaccessible in the Vedas
 haa, yah avashya sach he ki loukik sanskrit main prayukt shloke chand vaidic anushtubh chand kaa hi rup hai
 Looking at the differences between Vedic and cosmic Sanskrit, it is important to note that in terms of theory, the two are very similar to each other
 vedon main kuch or adhik dhvaniyaan milti hai, jaise ki l
 Other sound theories are similar to both and there is no difference in them as we find in Prakrit dialects
 19veen shatabdi main avastai farsi or vaidic sanskrit donon par pashchimi vidwaanon kii nazar nai-nai padi thi or in donon ke gahare sambandh kaa tathy unke saamne jaldi hi aa gaya
 He saw that the words of Avastai Persian and Vedic Sanskrit could be translated from one to the other with some simple rules and both were very close in terms of grammar
 apni san 1892 main prakashit kitaab "avastai vyakaran kii sanskrit se tulana or avastai varnmaala or uskaa lipyantaran" main bhashavaigyanik or vidwaan ebraham jackson ne udahaaran ke liye ek avastai dharmik shloke kaa vaidic sanskrit main sidhaa anuwaad kiya - Abhishek Chaubey is a director of Hindi films

 The year of the year 2761 BCE or the year before his birth is represented as the birth of Jesus

 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method

 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous

 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India

 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

 mahaar regiment bhartiya sena kaa ek infantry regiment he
 Although originally it was thought to combine the Mahar soldiers of Maharashtra, it is the only regiment of the Indian Army that is made up of soldiers from all communities and regions of India
 mahaar scouts or unki sena kile main sainikon ke rup main maratha raja shivaji dwaara bhartee kiye gaye the
 They were recruited by the East India Company Company in the sixth part of the Bombay Army to form a large part of the company
 bombay sena unki bahaduree or dhvaj ke prati vafadari ke liye mahaar sainikon isht or isliye bhi kyonki ve angl-maratha yuddh ke dauraan par bharosa kiya ja saktaa he
 They have achieved many successes, including in the Battle of Koregaon, where the Mahar-dominated company troops were defeated under the leadership of a much larger Peshwa Bajirao II
 yah ladaai ek obilisk, koregaanv stambh he, jo bhartiya swatantraaa jab tak mahaar regiment ke shikhar par chapa rup main janaa dwaara manaaya gaya
 The Mahar soldiers of the Bombay Army saw action in the [indian Rebellion of 1857], and joined the two regiments The rebellion under the British war of this regiment is "bolo Hindustan ki Jai"
 vidroh ke baad bhartiya sena ke british adhikariyon, vishesh rup se jo pratham or dwitiya afgaan yuddh main seva kii thi, marshall daud siddhant ke liye mudra dene ke liye shuru kiya
 It was theorized that some Indians were naturally warlike between castes and communities, and more suited to war than others

 The final blow to the Mahar soldiers came in 1892 when it was decided to institute "class regiments" in the Indian Army
 maharon in varg regimenton main shaamil nahin the, or yah adhishuchet kiya gaya tha ki maharon, kuch anya virgon ke saath ke bich, ab bhartiya sena main bhartee ho gaye the
 The Mahar soldiers, who included 104 Viceroy commissioned officers and a host of non-commissioned officers and soldiers, were demobilized
 is ghatana ko ek sarkari ve ek sau se adhik varshon ke liye kaam kiya tha dwaara apni vafadari kii ek vishwasghaat ke rup main maharon ne mana gaya tha
 After the demobilization of the Mahar troops, there were many attempts by the leaders of the Mahar community to persuade the Government to let them serve in the Army once again
 Petitions to this effect were drafted by ex-soldiers such as Gopal Baba Walangkar in 1894, and Shivram Janba Kamble in 1904
 These petitions were supported in principle by the politician and social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who was opposed to the Martial Races theory
 They were also supported by the Indian National Congress, who were also opposed to the recruiting policies of the Army
 The recruitment policies of the British Indian Army continued until the beginning of the First World War in 1914
 The War forced the Government to begin more broad-based recruiting, and the Mahars were at last allowed to enlist in the Army
 One battalion of Mahar troops, the 111th Mahars was raised in the June 1917
 However, the battalion did not see much service during the War, and in 1920 it was merged with the 71st Punjabis
 Finally, the battalion was disbanded in March 1921, and the Mahars were once again demobilised
 The period between the wars saw increased efforts by the Mahars to persuade the government to let them enlist in the Army
 One proponent of Mahar recruitment was Dr
 BR Ambedkar, whose father, Sub
 Maj
 Ramji Maloji Sakpal had been a soldier in the British Indian Army
 However, the proposed reorganization of the Indian Army that was to occur in the 1930s was postponed because of a lack of funds in the Great Depression
 In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and once again, the Army was forced to overlook its narrow minded recruitment policies in the face of harsh necessity
 In the July 1941, B
 R
 Ambedkar was appointed to the Defence Advisory Committee of the Viceroy's Executive Council
 He used this appointment to exert pressure within the military establishment for a Mahar regiment
 He also appealed to the Mahars to join the Army in large numbers
 In October, the Army gave in, and the 1st Battalion of the Mahar Regiment was raised in Belgaum under Lt
 Col
 HJR Jackson of the 13th Frontier Force Rifles and Sub
 Maj
 Sheikh Hassnuddin
 The 2nd Battalion was raised in Kamptee in June 1942 under Lt
 Col
 JWK Kirwan and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 a cap badge was designed for the Regiment by Capt
 EEL Mortlemans, an officer of 2nd Mahar
 The badge featured the Koregaon Pillar over the word "MAHAR"
 The third battalion, the 25th Mahars, was raised in Belgaum in the August 1942 by Lt
 Col V
 Chambier and Sub
 Maj
 Sardar Bahadur Ladkojirao Bhonsale, and the 3rd Mahars were raised in Nowshera by Lt
 Col
 RND Frier and Sub
 Maj
 Bholaji Ranjane
 During the War, the 1st and 3rd Mahars served in the north-west Frontier Province, while the 2nd and 25th Battalions were employed on internal security duties within the country
 The 2nd Battalion also saw service in the Burma Campaign as a part of the 23rd Indian Division, where they suffered 5 casualties and had one officer Mentioned in dispatches
 They also served in Iraq after the War as a part of PAIFORCE
 In 1946, the 25th Mahars were disbanded, along with many other garrison battalions of the Indian Army
 Its officers and men were largely absorbed by the other three battalions of the Regiment
 In the October 1946, the Regiment was converted into a Machine Gun Regiment, and the Regimental Centre was established at Kamptee
 Following conversion of the Regiment to a machine-gun regiment, the cap-badge was changed
 The new badge had two crossed Vickers machine guns over the Koregaon Pillar, over a scroll that said "the Mahar MG Regiment"
 The three surviving battalions of the regiment served as a part of the Punjab Boundary Force, and took part in escorting refugees during the Partition of India
 The Border Scouts were an irregular force formed by the people of the border villages in East Punjab during Partition
 Hailing as they did from the erstwhile greater state of East Punjab, the force had people hailing from a greater mix of ethnic, religious and caste backgrounds than was the norm in the Indian Army
 They did some useful work defending villages from attacks during partition, and as a reward, were given a more permanent character as the East Punjab Frontier Scouts in 1948
 They served along the border with Pakistan as border guards, and were regarded as a useful adjunct of the Punjab Armed Police
 The unit was redesignated the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Border Scouts in 1951, with recruitment from different North Indian communities
 In 1956, the decision to convert this force into machine-gun regiments was taken, and the three battalions were merged with the Mahar Regiment, the only Indian Machine Gun Regiment in existence at the time
 They joined the Regiment as the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions of the Mahar Regiment, and it is to these units that the Regiment traces its mixed-class composition
 The three Battalions style themselves battalions of the Mahar Regiment even today
 The class composition of the Regiment also changed
 While 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, 8th and 13th battalions were all pure Mahar battalions, the others were mixed classes right down to the smallest sub-unit level
 The conversion training started in November 1963 with 1st Mahar and completed in May 1964 with 10th Mahar
 The year 1965 saw all the battalions of the regiment gearing up for operations
 These included the newly raised 11th and 12th battalions that had the unique composition of Bengalis, Oriyas and Gujratis - the communities that had been stamped as non-martial by the British
 Their entry into the Mahar fraternity added strength to national integration-the distinctive feature which the regiment has always been proud of

 a transformer or transformer is an electrical machine with no moving or rotating components
 vidyut upkarnon main sambhavtah transafarmar sarvaadhik vyapak rup se prayukt vidyut sashitr he
 It transfers electrical energy from one electric circuit to another circuit by means of conductors connected by electric induction
 transfarmar keval prayavarti dhara yaa vibhavaantar ke saath kaary kar saktaa he, ekadish ke saath nahin
 Transformers can be one-phase, three-phase or multi-phase
 yah sabhi vidyut mashiinon main sarvaadhik daksh mashin he
 In the modern era, the transformer has become an integral part of the electrical and electronic industries
 kisi transafarmar main ek, do yaa adhik vinding ho sakati hai
 The number of primary and secondary winding turns of two winding transformers and their potentials has the following relation: is sutara se spasht he ki primary voltata ke diye hue maan ke liye primary evam secondari vinding ke pheron kii sankhya kaa uchit chayan karke ham dwitiyak vinding main icchit vibhavaantar praapt kar sakate hai
 When the voltage of the secondary winding is greater than the voltage of the primary winding, such transformer is called the high transformer
 iske vipareet jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se kam hota he to aise parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 The main use of transformer is to convert electric power to high voltage or low voltage
 aisa karne se vidyut urja ke upyog main suvidha or dakshata aati he
 It is important to note that the ideal transformer does not generate energy or power, nor does it change power, nor does it change frequency
 parinamitra prayukt vidyut ke kshetra main Probably the most widely used vaidyut sashitr he
 All the credit for the predominance of the alternating current in the industries as compared to the direct current is only to the resultant
 yah aisa saadhitra he jo nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara ko ucch voltata kii nimna dhara main or ucch voltata kii nimnadhara ko nimnavoltata kii ucch dhara main parinamit karata he
 This result is accomplished with minimal loss of energy and without the aid of any moving part in the appliance
 100 volt kii 10,000 wat vidyutakti ke parinman ke liye 100 ampiore dhara aavashyak hoti he
 But only one ampere current at a voltage of 10,000 is sufficient
 at: duusari sthiti main pehali kii apeksha bahut hi kam vyasavaala or is kaaran sasta chaalak aavashyak hota he
 The conductivity of the transformer is based on a unique finding by Michael Faraday, according to which the induced conductor force in the circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux across the region bounded by the circuit
 saralatam rup main parinamitra main do alag alag kundaliyaan hoti hai, jinka chumbakeey paripath ek hi hota he
 The coil of the transformer is identified according to the direction of flow of power
 praathmik kundali ko prayavarti vidyudurja ke strot se jodate hai or dwitiyak ko lod se
 Energy is transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil by electromagnetic induction
 adarsh parinamitra ke kriyasanchalan kii visheshtaayen hai : In practice, this ideal situation is unpredictable
 parinamitra kii praathmik kundali se judi sambharan voltata chumbakeey flux utpann karti he, jo parinamitra ke patlit crode se sambhddha hoti he
 The alternating voltage Ep connected to the primary coil of the transformer is expressed as the density Bm of the highest magnetic flux, the area a of the transverse section of the lattice core, the frequency f of the alternating current of the alternating current, and the number of naps in the primary coil
 : praathmik kundali main pravaahit dhara dwaara utpann prayavarti chumbakeey flux dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton ko bhi sambhddha karata he
 The difference between primary and secondary coils is only the number of wraps, so the effective value of the induced voltage in the secondary coil is prakaar praathmik or dwitiyak voltata kaa nimnlikhit anupaat praapt hota he: The number of wraps in the primary coil N1 is kept less than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2 when the voltage of the primary coil is required to increase
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai or praathmik kundali kii voltata yadi dwitiyak kii voltata se adhik he to praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sankhya N1 dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se badi hogi
 This type of transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 saamanyat: parinamitra kaa swaroop nimnlikhit baton se nirdhaarit hota he: The efficiency of a simple power transformer is very high at normal load, ranging from 90 percent in small units to 98 percent in large transformers
 saamaanya: pratishat main vyakt parinamitra kii dakshata ko is prakaar abhivyakt kar sakate hai : There is a difference in the instantaneous efficiency of the transformers and the efficiency throughout the day
 parinamitra ke niyantran kaa arth hota he nivesh voltata ke sthir rahane par purna lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata or bina lod kii sthiti main dwitiyak voltata kaa sambandh
 When expressed as a percentage, control can be defined as: chote parinamitron ke liye niyantran 2 se 5 pratishat or bado ke liye lagbhag 1 pratishat ke kram kaa hota he
 The transformer mainly consists of two parts: 1) kor - jo kisi chumbakeey padaarth kii banaayi jaati he
 2) Winding - which is made of copper, aluminum or any other conductor wires or bus bar
 iske atirikt kuchaalak aadi bhi prayog kiye jate hai jo vinding ke pheron ko aapas main yaa kor se chhune se rokte hai
 Transformer oil is used in high voltage transformers which prevent sparks from exceeding breakdown strength and heat by cooling the core and coil
 parinamitra ko thanda rakhane ke liye tel ke alaava evam kai anya shitakon kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he jaise pani evam gas aadi
 Vritti is a word related to yoga which literally means 'whirlpool'

 She said- Maharaj, i do not need such money, which i donate to other people, which will save all my time only in keeping and handling, now you please do so that all the money is destroyed and i can live comfortably
 sadhu ne uttar diya yadi tumhaari aisi ichha he to jaisaa main tumhen bataata hum tum vaisaa hi karnaa brihaspativaar ko ghar ko gobar se lipana apane keson ko pili mitti se dhonaa keson ko dhote samay snaan karnaa, raja se kahana vah hajaamat banawaye bhojan main maance madiraa khaanaa kapadaa dhobi ke yahaan dhulane daalana, aisa karne se saat brihaspativaar main aapkaa sara dhan nasht ho jayega
 Saying so, that Sadhu Maharaj entered from there
 jaise vah sadhu kah kar gaya tha rani ne vaisaa hi kiya
 It was only on Thursday that all his wealth was destroyed and both started craving for food
 sansaarik bhogon se dukhi rahane lage
 Then the king started saying to the queen that you stay here, i should go to another country because i know all humans here, so no one can work
 desh chori pardesh bheekh baraabar he aisa kahkar raja pardesh chalaa gaya vahaan jangal ko jaataa or lakdi katkar laata or shahar main benchataa is tarah jivan vyateet karne laga
 Here, the queen and the maid continue to be unhappy without the king
 kisi din bhojan miltaa or kisi din jal pikar hi rah jaati
 At one time when the queen and the maidens had to stay without food for seven days, the queen said to her maid, o maid
 paas hi ke nagar main meri bahan rahati he 
 She is very rich
 tu uske paas ja aaor 5 ser bejhar maang kar le aa taaki kuch samay ke liye thodaa-bahut guzar-basar ho jaae 
 Maid went to the queen's sister
 us din brihaspativaar tha 
 The queen's sister was listening to the story of Thursday
 daasi ne rani kii bahan ko apni rani kaa sandesh diya, lekin rani kii bahan ne koi uttar nahin diya 
 When the maid did not get any reply from the queen's sister, she was very sad
 use krodh bhi aayaa 
 Maid came back and told the queen everything
 sunakar, rani ne kahaan kii he daasi isamen uskaa koi dosha nahin he jab bure din aate hai tab koi sahaara nahi achche bure kaa pataa vipatti main hi lagata he jo ishwar kii ichha hogi vahi hoga yah sab hamaare bhagya kaa dosha he
 Saying all this, Ra Rani cursed her fate
 udhar, rani kii bahan ne sochaa ki meri bahan kii daasi ai thi, parantu main usase nahin boli, isse vah bahut dukhi hui hogi 
 Hearing the story and ending the worship, she went to her sister's house and said, o sister
 main brihaspativaar kaa vrath kar rahi thi 
 Your maid lost, but till the time the story happens, neither do i get up nor speak, that's why i did not speak
 kaho, daasi kyon gai thi 
 Rani Boli, sister
 hamaare ghar anaaj nahin tha 
 Saying this, the queen's eyes filled with tears
 usne daasiyon samet 7 din tak bhookha rahane kii baat bhi apni bahan ko bataa di 
 That is why i sent the maid to you to take five seers
 rani kii bahan boli, bahan dekho 
 Lord Jupiterdev fulfills everyone's wishes
 dekho, shaayad tumhaare ghar main anaaj rakhaa ho 
 At first the queen did not believe but at the request of her sister, she sent the maid inside
 daasi ghar ke andar gai to vahaan use ek gadaa bejhar kaa bharaa mil gaya 
 He was very surprised because he saw every single pot
 usne baahar aakar rani ko bataaya 
 The maid said to the queen, o queen
 jab hamako bhojan nahin miltaa to ham vrath hi to karte he, isaliye kyon na inase vrath or katha kii vidhi puch lee jaye, ham bhi vrath kiya karenge 
 On the maid's request, the queen asked her sister about the Thursday fast
 uski bahan ne bataaya, brihaspativaar ke vrath main chane kii daal gud or munakka se vishnu bhagwaan kaa kele ke vriksh kii jad main pujan karen tathaa deepak jalaayen or katha sune 
 Eat food at the same time of day, eat yellow food items
 isse guru bhagwaan prasann hote he, ann, putr,dhan dete hai
 Fulfills wishes vrath or pujan kii vidhi bataakar rani kii bahan apane ghar laut ai 
 Both the queen and the maid decided that Vrihaspati Dev would worship God
 saat roj baad jab brihaspativaar aayaa to unhone vrath rakhaa 
 Going to the mews, he brought gram and jaggery bean and worshiped Lord Vishnu with banana root and pulses
 ab pilaa bhojan kahan se aae 
 Both are very sad
 parantu unhone vrath kiya tha isaliye brihaspatidev bhagwaan prasann the 
 As an ordinary person, he brought beautiful yellow food in two plates and gave it to the maid and said, o maid
 yah bhojan tumhaare liye or tumhaari rani ke liye he, ise tum donon grahan karnaa 
 Maid was very happy to get food
 usne rani se kaha chalo rani ji bhojan kar lo parantu rani ko bhojan aane ke bare main kuch bhi nahin pataa tha isliye usne kaha ki ja tu hi bhojan kar kyonki tu vyarth main hamaari hansi udaati he
 Then the maid said that a person has given food, then the queen said that that person has given food for you only you should eat
 tab daasi ne kaha vah vyakti ham donon ke liye do thaalon main sundar pilaa bhojan de gaya he isliye main or aap donon hi saath saath bhojan karenge 
 The queen was very happy to hear this and both of them saluted Guru Bhagwan and started a meal
 uske baad se ve prayek brihaspativaar ko guru bhagwaan kaa vrath or pujan karne lagi 
 By the grace of Lord Jupiter they got riches
 parantu rani phir pehle kii tarah aalasy karne lagi 
 Then the maid said, look queen
 tum pehle bhi is prakaar aalasy karti thi, tumhen dhan ke rakhane main ksht hota tha, is kaaran sabhi dhan nasht ho gaya 
 Now you have got laziness by the grace of Guru God, then you are lazy
 badi museebaton ke baad hamane yah dhan paaya he, isaliye hamen daan-punya karnaa chaiye 
 Now you provide food to the hungry humans, make the people payable, make donations to the Brahmins, build a well pond, baoli, garden, etc
 Build a temple Pathshala Dharamshala, make a donation to the married girls of the poor, as well as perform sacrifices and spend your money in auspicious works
 Do it jisb tumhaare kul kaa yash bade tathaa swarg praapt ho or pittar prasann hon 
 The queen began to perform auspicious deeds by obeying the maid
 uskaa yash failane laga 
 One day the queen and the maid started thinking among themselves that in which case the king will not know, there is no news of their discovery
 unhone shradghapurvak guru bhagwaan se prarthana kii ki raja jahaan kahin bhi ho, sheeghra waapas aa jaaenusi raatri ko brihaspati dev ne raja ko swapan main kaha ki he raja uth teri rani tujko yaad karti he apane desh ko laut ja
 The king woke up in the morning and walked towards the forest to cut wood from the forest
 jangal se guzarate hue vichaar karne laga ki rani kii galati se use kitne dukh bhogane pade rajpaat chhodkar jangal main aakar main aakar rahanaa padaa jangal se lakdi katkar shahar main bechakar guzaara karnaa padaa
 And remembering his condition, he started getting distraught
 usee samay raja ke paas brihaspatidev sadhu ke vesh main aakar bole, he lakadahare 
 Tell me, in what concern are you sitting in this deserted forest? yah sun raja ke netron main jal bhar aayaa 
 The king narrated his entire story after praying to the monk
 mahatma dayaalu hote he 
 They said to the king, o king, your wife had committed a crime against Brihaspatidev, due to which your condition happened
 ab tum chintaa mat karo bhagwaan tumhen pehle se adhik dhan dengen 
 Look, your wife has started the fast on Thursday
 ab tum bhi brihaspativaar ke vrath main chane kii daal gud or munakka se vishnu bhagwaan kaa kele ke vriksh kii jad main pujan karen tathaa deepak jalaayen or katha sune 
 Eat food at the same time of day, eat yellow food items
 
 God will fulfill all your wishes
 sadhu kii baat sunakar raja bolaa, he prabho 
 There is not much money left by selling wood, so that i can save some after meals
 maine raatri main apni rani ko vyakul dekha he 
 i have no means to know his news
 phir main koun si kahani kahuun, yah bhi mujhako maaloom nahin he 
 The monk said, o king
 man main brihaspati bhagwaan ke pujan-vrath kaa nishchay karo 
 They themselves will make a path for you
 brihaspativaar ke din tum rojaanaa kii tarah lakadiyaan lekar shahar main janaa 
 You will get double the amount of money from every day, by which you will eat well and the goods of the worship of Vrihaspati Dev will also come
 jo tumne brihaspativaar kii kahani ke bare main poocha he, vah is prakaar he - Story of Vrihaspathidev prachinkaal main ek bahut hi nirdhan brahaman tha 
 He had no children
 vah nity puja-paath karata, uski stri na snaan karti or na kisi devtaa kaa pujan karti 
 Due to this, the Brahmin gods used to be very unhappy with their wife, but they did not yield any result
 bhagwaan kii krupa se brahaman ke yahaan ek kanya utpann hui 
 The girl started growing up
 praatah snaan karke vah bhagwaan vishnu kaa jap karti 
 Started fast on Thursday
 puja paath samaapt kar paathshaala jaati to apni mutthi main jau bharke le jaati or paathshaala ke maarg main daalati jaati 
 On returning, the same barley would have become golden and would have brought it home
 ek din vah balika soup main un sone ke jau ko fatkakar saaf kar rahi thi ki tabhi uski maa ne dekh liya or kaha, ki he beti 
 There should also be a golden soup to rip the gold barley
 duusare din guuruuvaar tha 
 The girl kept a fast and prayed to Vrihaspatidev to give her a soup of gold and said, Lord, if i have worshiped you with a sincere heart, give me a soup of gold
 
 Vrihaspathidev accepted her prayer
 rojaanaa kii tarah vah kanya jau failaati hui paathshaala chali gai 
 After returning from school, when she was growing barley, she got a gold soup by the grace of Vrihaspathidev
 use vah ghar le ai or usase jau saaf karne lagi 
 But his mother remained the same
 ek din kii baat he 
 When the barley was cleaning in Kanya's gold soup, the prince of that city left from there
 kanya ke rup or kaary ko dekhakar vah us par mohit ho gaya 
 After coming to the palace, he left food and water and lay down sadly
 raja ko jab rajkumaar dghaara ann-jal tyaagane kaa samachar gyaat hua to apane mantriyon ke saath vah apane putr ke paas gaya or poocha he betaa ! tumhen kis baat kaa ksht he kisi ne tumhaara apmaan kiya he athwa koi or kaaran he mujhe bataao main vahi kaary karuunga jisase tumhen prasannataa ho
 Hearing his father's words, the prince said, "O father!" i am not sad that nobody has insulted me but i want to marry the girl who was cleaning Joe in the pleasure of sleep
 rajkumaar ne raja ko us ladki ke ghar kaa pataa bhi bataa diya 
 The minister went to the girl's house
 mantri ne brahaman ke samaksh raja kii ore se nivedan kiya 
 a few days later, the marriage of the Brahmin's daughter was completed with the prince
 kanya ke ghar se jate hi brahaman ke ghar main pehle kii bhaanti garibi kaa nivas ho gaya 
 One day, unhappy, the Brahmin went to meet his daughter
 beti ne pita kii avasthaa ko dekha or apni maan kaa haal poocha brahaman ne sabhi haal kah sunaaya 
 Virgo gave her father a lot of money and sent her away
 lekin kuch din baad phir vahi haal ho gaya 
 The Brahmin then went to his daughter's daughter and said all the things, the daughter said, "O father
" aap mataji ko yahan liva lao 
 i will tell them the method, which removes poverty
 brahaman devtaa apni stri ko saath lekar apni putree ke paas rajmahal pahunche to putree apni maa ko samajhane lagi, he maa, tum praatavkaal snanadi karke vishnu bhagwan kaa pujan karo or brihaspativaar kaa vrath karo to sab daridrata dur ho jaaegi 
 But his mother did not listen to him
 vah praatavkaal uthakar apni putree kii bacchon kaa jhuthan ko kha leti thi 
 One day his daughter got very angry, she locked her mother in a cell
 praatah use snanadi karake puja-paath karavaaya to uski maan kii budghi thik ho gai
 After this, she started worshiping from the rule and started fasting every Thursday
 is vrath ke prabhaav se mrityu ke baad vah swarg ko gai 
 That Brahmin too attained the pleasure of this world and attained heaven
 is tarah kahani kahkar sadhu bane devtaa vahaan se lop ho gayi 
 Gradually, on time, again came the day of Thursday
 raja jangal se lakdi katkar shahar main bechney gaya 
 He got more money from that day and days
 raja ne chanaa, gud aadi laakar brihaspativaar kaa vrath kiya 
 From that day all his tribulations were gone
 parantu jab agle guuruuvaar kaa din aayaa to vah brihaspativaar kaa vrath karnaa bhul gaya 
 For this reason Lord Jupiter got angry
 us din us nagar ke raja ne vishaal yajna kaa aayojan kiya tha tathaa apane samast rajya main ghoshnaa karvaa di ki sabhi mere yahaan bhojan karne aawein 
 Do not burn the kitchen
 is ajna ko jo na maanegaa usko faansee de di jaaegi 
 According to the king's knowledge, all the residents of the state joined the king's banquet but the woodcutter arrived a little late, so the king took him with him to the palace
 jab raja lakadahare ko bhojan kara rahe the to rani kii drushti us khunti par padi, jis par uskaa haralataka hua tha 
 He did not let the necklace hang on the peg
 rani ko nishchay ho gaya ki meraa haar is lakadahare ne chura liya he 
 At the same time, he called the soldier and put him in jail
 lakadahaara jail main vichaar karne laga ki na jane koun se purvajanm ke karm se mujhe yah dukh praapt hua he or jangal main mili sadhu ko yaad karne laga 
 Immediately Vrihaspati Dev appeared as a monk and started saying, "oh fool
" tuune brihaspati devtaa kii katha nahin kii, usee kaaran tuje yah dukh praapt hua hai 
 Do not worry now brihaspativaar ke din jailkhane ke daravaaje par tuje chaar paise pade milenge, unase tu brihaspativaar kii puja karnaa to ter sabhi ksht dur ho jaayenge 
 The next Thursday, he received four paise at the jail
 raja ne puja kaa saamaan mangvakar katha kahi or prasad baanta 
 In the same night, Vrhaspati Dev said to the king of that city in a dream, o king
 tuune jise jail main band kiya he, use kal chhod dena 
 He is innocent
 vaale raja he 
 The queen's necklace hangs on the same peg
 agar tu aisa nahin karegaa to main tere rajya ko nasht kar duungaa
 The king woke up in the morning and seeing the necklace hanging on the peg, he called the woodcutter and asked for forgiveness and sent the king a beautiful cloth ornament worthy of him
 gurudev kii aagyaanusaar raja apane nagar ko chal diya 
 When the king approached near the city, he was very surprised
 nagar main pehle se adhik baag, talab or kuen tathaa bahut-si dharmashalaayein, mandir aadi bane hue the 
 The king asked, whose garden and dharamshala and temple are this? Then all the people of the city started saying that all these were built by the queen and the maid
 raja ko aashcharya hua or gussa bhi aayaa ki uski anupasthiti main rani ke paas dhan kahaan se aayaa hoga 
 When the queen heard the news that the king was coming, she told her maid, o maid
 dekh, raja hamako kitni buree haalat main chhod gayi the 
 He should not return after seeing our condition, so stand at the door
 rani kii aagyaanusaar daasi daravaaje par khadi ho gai or jab raja aae to unhen apane saath mahal main liva laai 
 Then the king got out his sword in anger and started asking, Tell me, how you have received this money
 tab rani ne sari katha sunai ki yah sab dhan hamen brihaspati dev ke vrath ke prabhaav se praapt hua he
 The king decided that i would tell the story thrice a day every day and would do a fast every day
 ab har samay raja ke dupattey main chane kii daal bandhi rahati tathaa din main teen baar katha kahata 
 One day the king thought that he should come here with his sister
 is tarah kaa nishchay kar raja ghode par savaar ho apni bahan ke yahaan chal diya 
 On the way he saw that some men were carrying a corpse
 unhen rokkar raja kehane laga, are bhaaiyo 
 Listen to my Thursday story
 ve bole, lo, hamaara to aadmi mar gaya he, isko apni katha kii padi he 
 But some men said, well say, we will also listen to your story
 raja ne daal nikaali or katha kehani shuru kar di 
 When the story was half dead, the corpse started moving and when the story was over, the dead man stood up after doing Ram
 raja aage badha 
 He went in the evening while walking
 aage maarg main use ek kisaan khet main hal chalaata mila 
 The king asked him to listen to the fast on Thursday, till i hear your story, till then, i will take four haraiya plots and tell my story to someone else
 raja aage chal padaa 
 As soon as the king was away, the bull fell backward and fell into the stomach of the farmer who was in a dull state
 usee samay kisaan kii maa roti lekar ai 
 When he saw it, he asked his son everything
 bete ne sabhi haal bataa diya 
 The old lady ran to the horseman and said to her, i will listen to your story, tell your story on my farm
 raja ne lautakar budhiya ke khet par jaakar katha kahi, jiske sunate hi bail khadey ho gayi tathaa kisaan ke pet kaa dard bhi band ho gaya 
 The king reached his sister's house
 bahan ne bhai kii khub mehmaani kii 
 The next morning the king woke up and he began to see that everybody is eating
 raja ne apni bahan se jab poocha, aisa koi manushya he, jisane bhojan nahin kiya ho 
 Who listens to my Thursday story
 bahan boli, he bhaiya yah desh aisa hi he yahan log pehle bhojan karte he, baad main koi anya kaam karte he 
 If someone is in the neighborhood, i come and see it, saying that she went to see it, but she did not find any person who did not have food
 phir vah ek kumhaar ke ghar gai, jiskaa ladkaa biimaar tha 
 He came to know that he has not had any food here for three days
 rani ne apane bhai kii katha sunne ke liye kumhaar se kaha to vah taiyaar ho gaya
 The king went and told the story of Thursday
 jisko sunakar uskaa ladkaa thik ho gaya 
 Now the king started getting praised
 ek din raja ne apni bahan se kaha, he bahan 
 i will go to my house now, you too get ready
 raja kii bahan ne apni saas se apane bhai ke saath jane kii ajna maangi 
 Mother-in-law said yes, but do not take your boys, because you do not have any children
 bahan ne apane bhai se kaha, he bhaiya 
 i will go, but no child will go
 raja bolaa jab koi balak nahin jayega tab tum hi jaakar kya karogi
 Leaving his sister also, the king returned to his city with a sad heart
 raja ne apni rani se sari katha bataai ki ham nisantan he isliye koi hamaare ghar aana pasand nahin karata he or bina bhojan kiye vah shayya par let gaya 
 The queen said, Vrihaspathidev has given us everything, they will also give us children
 usee raat brihaspatidev ne raja ko swapn main kaha, he raja 
 Wake up, abandon all thinking
 teri rani garbhvatee he 
 The king was very happy to know this
 nawein maheen rani ke garbh se ek sundar putr paidaa hua 
 Then the king said, o queen
 stri bina bhojan ke rah sakati he, parantu bina kahe nahin rah sakati 
 When my sister comes, you don't say anything to her
 rani ne haa kar di 
 When the king's sister heard this auspicious news, she was very happy and came to her brother's house with a great gift
 rani ne tab usase kaha ghoda chadhakar to nahin ai gadhaa chadhi ai to raja kii bahan boli, bhai 
 If i had not said like this, how would your home have been? brihaspatidev sabhi kamanaayen purna karte he 
 a person who fasts on Thursday and recites or recites the story and narrates it to others, Vrihaspati Dev fulfills all his wishes, always protecting them
 jo sansar main sadbhaavna se gurudev kaa pujan evam vrath sachche hriday se karte he, unki sabhi mankaamanaayen vaise hi purna hoti he, jaisi sachhee bhaavana se rani or raja ne brihaspatidev kii katha kaa gungan kiya, to unki sabhi icchhaaen brihaspatidev ji ne purna kii 
 That is why everyone should take Prasad after hearing the story
