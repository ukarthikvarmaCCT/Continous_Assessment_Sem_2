 a year later, after taking its third World Championship, Senna expressed his previous year's activities in Suzuka to the press
 sarvaadhik tezi se kwalifing karne se pehle unhone kaha ki, unhen res adhikariyon se yah aashwaasan mila tha ki pole pojishan ko trek ke saaf vaale hisse kii taraf yani baayen-haath kii taraf rakhaa jayega, lekin unke pole pojishan praapt karne ke baad unhone paaya ki is nirnay ko jin-meri belestrey ke dwaara ulat diya gaya
 Referring to the confrontation with Prost, Senna said he wanted it to be clear that he would not accept the decision taken by Bellestre, which he considered an unfair decision, including his disqualification in 1989 and Poll in 1990
 Positions include: "mujhe lagata he ki 1989 main jo bhi hua vah akshamya tha or main ise kabhi nahin bhul paaungaa
 abhi bhi iske saath muqabla karne ke liye main sangharsh kar rahaa hum
 aapako pataa he yahaan kya hua tha: prost or main dohare mode main aapas main tab takaraa gaye, jab vah meri taraf muda

 Whatever happened later
 

 vah naatak tha, lekin jo maine mahasoos kiya vah main nahin kah saktaa tha
 If you do something, you get penalized, you get fined, maybe you have to lose your license
 Is this the proper way to work? this is not right
 

sujuka main pichley saal maine adhikariyon se pole pojishan ko daaen haath se baane kii taraf karne ke liye kaha tha
 This was unfair, because the right side is always dirty and there is less grip - you work hard to get the pole position and after getting it you have to pay the penalty
 or unhone kaha, "haa, ham badal denge, isamen koi samasya nahin he"
 uske baad, aapako pataa he kya hua? belestrey ne yah aadesh diya ki ise badla nahin jayega
 main jaanata hum ki system kaise kaam karata he or maine mahasoos kiya ki sachmuch yah anuchit tha
 So i said to myself, "well, whatever happens, I'm going to take the first position of the first corner - i wasn't ready to let that player come before me in that corner
 agar main uske kaaphi kareeb hum, vah kabhi bhi mere saamne se mud nahi saktaa, use mujhe jane dena hi padegaa
" agar ham takaraa bhi jate hai to isaki parvaah mujhe nahin thi; main iske liye taiyaar tha
 And he got a chance, he turned towards me and we crashed
 yah kaaphi badi or aprihaary durghatana thi
 It had to happen
 " to kisi ne kaha ki vaaki aisa aapke kaaran hua
 "how did this happen because of me?" The army reacted
 "what will you do if you have to face punishment for doing your job optimally while staying in the system? Stand back, say thanks? It can't happen
 You should fight for what you believe is right
 If the pole left On the other hand, i would have easily transitioned to the first corner at the time of the hike, there would have been no problem
 The decision to put the pole on the right side was wrong and this decision was influenced by Belestre
 or jiskaa parinaam pehle corner kii ghatana thi
 i have contributed to this, but it is not my responsibility
 baad main prost ne sena kii gatividhiyon ko "ghrunit" kaha or kaha ki gambhir rup se is ghatana ke baad use khel se avkaash grahan karne par vichaar karnaa chahie
 Sena captured its third title in 1991, including seven victories and was largely free of controversy

 These revisions delayed him to success in the season and somehow managed to win three other races to secure the championship, which resulted in a good result in Japan, when Mansell raced to the first corner and finished third

 In 1992, Sena's determination to win was demonstrated as mclaren's inability to challenge Williams' all-conquering FW14B car
 mclaren's new car had several drawbacks for that season

 Nevertheless, the term relativity or relativity is sometimes used to refer to Galilean invariance
 theory off relativity naamak is shabd kaa prayog sabase pehle san 1906 main maiks plank ne kiya tha
 It was derived from the English term group "relative Theory" which describes how this theory uses the Principles of Relativity
 isi paper ke charchaa sambhag main alfred bukarar ne pratham baar "theory of relativity" kaa prayog kiya tha
 The relativity principle is in essence that the existence of 'absolute' speed and 'absolute' acceleration is impossible, that is, the terms 'absolute speed' and 'absolute acceleration' are virtually meaningless
 yadi 'nirpeksh gati' kaa arth hota to vah anya pindo kii charchaa kiye bina hi nishchit ho sakati
 But even after trying all the ways, the 'absolute' motion of a body has not been definitively proved by experiment and now the theory of relativity suggests that it is impossible to determine it
 aapekshikta siddhant se bhautikee main ek nae drushtikon kaa prarambh hua
 With the advent of relativity theory, some old theories of physics were firmly fixed and there was a need to think more closely about many fundamental imaginations
 vigyaan main siddhant kaa kaary praaia: gyaat falon ko vyavasthit rup se sutrit karnaa hota he or uske baad us siddhant se nae falon kaa anumaan karke prayog dwaara un falon kii pariksha kii jaati he
 Relativity theory has been successful in both these works
 19veen shatabdi ke ant tak bhautikee kaa vikaas newton pranit siddhanton ke anusaar ho rahaa tha
 Every new invention or experimental fruit was seen from the point of view of these principles and necessary new hypotheses were made
 inamen sarvyaapee ether kaa ek vishisht sthaan tha
 There were two major reasons for imagining the existence of ether
 pratham to vidyutchumbakeey tarangon ke kampan kaa ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak prasaran hone ke liye ether jaise madhyam kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Second, Newton's kinetic equations in mechanics, and also the background on which these equations were based, required an authentic director
 prayogon ke falon kaa yatharth akalan hone ke liye ether par vishisht gundharmon kaa aropan kiya jaataa tha
 Ether was considered ubiquitous and believed to exist in all directions and bodies
 is sthir ether main pind bina pratirodh ke bhraman kar sakate hai, aisi kalpana thi
 Due to these properties, there was no obstacle in understanding ether as an absolute standard
 prakaash kii gati 3x108 me
 prati second he, yah gyaat hua tha or prakaash kii tarangen 'sthir' ether ke saapeksh is gati se vikirit hoti hai, aisi kalpana thi
 In mechanics, ether was also considered an absolute standard for velocity, acceleration, force, etc
 19veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main ether kaa astitv tathaa uske gundharm sthapit karne ke anek praytn prayog dwaara kiye gaye
 Among them, the use of Michelson Morley is particularly important and notable
 prithvi, surya kii parikrama ether ke saapeksh jis gati se karti he us gati kaa yatharth maapan karnaa is prayog kaa uddeshy tha
 But this attempt was unsuccessful and from the result of the experiment it was estimated that the speed of the earth with respect to ether is zero
 iskaa yah bhi arth hua ki ether kii kalpana asaty he, arthath ether kaa astitv hi nahin he
 If there is no ether then even absolute standards cannot exist
 at: gati keval saapeksh hi ho sakati he
 In physics, work is usually done by directing any one method to measure the speed or to express the result
 kintu in nirdeshak paddatiyon main koi bhi paddati 'vishistaaapurna' nahin ho sakati, kyonki yadi aisa hota to us 'vishistaaapurna' nirdeshak paddati ko ham vishranti kaa maanak samaj sakate
 a similar result was obtained from many experiments
 in prayogon ke falon se keval bhautikee main hi nahin, balki vigyaan tathaa darshan main bhi gambhir ashaanti utpann hui
 In the early 20th century, the famous French mathematician H
 Poincaré presented the rule of relativity
 inke anusaar bhautikee ke niyam aise swaroop main vyakt hone chahie ki ve kisi bhi prekshak ke liye vaastavik hon
 This means that the laws of physics should not be observable above the speed of the observer
 is pranium se dik tathaa kaal kii prachlit dharanaon par nayaa prakaash padaa
 Einstein's ideology on this subject, though revolutionary, was more successful in explaining the fruits of experiments
 oinstin ne gati, twaran, dik, kaal ityadi moulik shabdon kaa or unase sanyukt prachlit dharanaon kaa vishesh vishleshan kiya
 From this analysis, it became clear that there are errors in physics based and distinguished by Newton's theories
 oinstin pranit aapekshikta siddhant ke do vibhaag hai : In specific relativity theory the laws of physics are expressed in the form that they will be the same for any observant observer
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is prakaar vyakt hote hai ki ve prekshak kii gati se swatantra yaa abaadhit honge
 The specific relativity theory developed in 1905 and the general relational theory developed in 1915
 iskaa pratipaadan san 1905 main oinstin ne apane ek shodhpatr on da electrodinemics off mowing bodies main kii thi
 Specific relativity is based on two hypotheses that contradict the concepts of classical mechanics: vishisht aapekshikta ke siddhanth se nikalne vaale parinaam ascharyajanak hai; inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: In classical mechanics Galileo's transformation is used while Lorents transformation in specific relativity
 san 1907 se 1911 ke bich ainstin dwaara viksit aapekshikta siddhanth hi 'saamaanya aapekshikta' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 This theory is based on the following two hypotheses: lambaai, dik, kaal, dravyaman, urja ityadi ke vishay main bhotiki main jo dharanaayen thim unamem vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ne sudhaar kiya
 Apart from these, there are other subjects in the field of physics which are equally important, but their inclusion is not in the specific relativity theory
 bal tathaa vidyutchumbakeey kshetron main vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa jaisaa upyog ho saktaa he vaisaa gurutveey kshetra main nahin ho saktaa
 Gravity is an extremely important department of physics, so it is clear that there is a need to broaden the specific relativity theory
 dravyaman kaa sambandh bhautikee main do prakaar se aata he
 When a force acts on a body, the body's position changes and its velocity changes
 jab tak bal kaary karata he tab tak pind ko twaran miltaa he
 According to the laws of mechanics the force, mass and acceleration of the body have the following relation: is sameekaran main jo dravyaman m he usko jadtv yaa ashrith dravyaman kehete hai
 The second relation of mass comes under the gravitational field of Newton
 newton dwaara diye gayi gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke anusaar yadi do dravyaman, m1 tathaa m2, duuri r par hon, to unke bich main nimnlikhit gurutvkarshneey bal f kaam karegaa : g is the gravitational constant in this equation
 yadi ham m1 ko prithvi kaa dravyaman samajhen or m2 ko dharti ke paas sthit kisi anya pind kaa dravyaman samajhen to sameekaran dravyaman m2 kaa bhaar vyakt karegaa
 In Newton's mechanics, kinetics and gravity are independent and different, but both have a relationship of mass
 dravyaman ke in do swatantra tathaa bhinn vibhaagon main prayukt kalpanaaon kaa ekikaran oinstin ne apane saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main kiya
 It was known that inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same
 oinstin ne dravyaman kii is samanta kaa upyog karke gativigyaan or gurutvkarshan ko ekarup kiya or san 1915 i
 main vyapak aapekshikta siddhant prastut kiya
 The method of formulating general relativity theory in mathematics is different from other methods
 isamen vishesh jyamiti kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo euclid kii tri-aiami jyamiti se bhinn he
 ] Stated that in the specific relativity theory, if the three dimensions of difficulty and the fourth dimension of time, a 'chatrayayam Satti' with these four dimensions, is imagined, then the theory of relativity becomes much simpler
 samakshanikta, nirpeksh nahin he - yah pramanit kiya ja chukaa he
 This eliminates the Newton-posed problem and the absolute and freedom of time
 at: bhautik ghatana vyakt karne ke liye dik tathaa samay kii chaturaayam satati adhik swaabhaavik he
 Einstein made more use of what Reiman had developed for his geometry by imagining 'chatrayayam Dikha'
 dik tathaa samay kii is chaturaayam satati main bhautikee ke siddhant jyamitiya rup se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant main rakhe gaye
 This Chatrayayam Satti is equated with the problem of Euclid's three dimensions
 teen aayam kii satati main, in teen nirdeshaankon se jis prakaar bindu athwa ek sthaan nishchit hota he, vaise hi do bindu or ke bich kii lambaai bhi nishchit hoti he
 When time is added along these three dimensions of the problem in Chatrayayam Sati, then the dimension of time comes as t = x0
5c-1, where t = time and c = velocity of light
 ek prekshak ke liye ek vishwaghatana ke nirdenshank hon to us prekshak ke saapeksh gatiman duusare prekshak ke liye usee ghatana ke nirdeshank honge
 If the laws of Lorenz's conversion are true, it can be proved that sameekaran kaa vikaas karke kisi bhi prakaar kii gati ke liye isi prakaar kii kintu atyadhik sanmishra padasanhtiyaan milti hai
 For this, the principles of principles and principles are required
 moulik kalpanaaon kaa is reeti se vistaar karne par vyapak aapekshikta siddhant main gurutvkarshan swabhaavat: aata he
 It does not require specific hypotheses
 anek ghatnaon ke fal, oinstin pranit vyapak aapekshikta siddhant ke anusaar tathaa newton pranit pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar, samaan hi hote hai
 But when the general relativity principle was used in astronomy, the results of the three phenomena differed somewhat from those produced according to the iconic mechanics
 in falon se saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kii kasuti kaa kaam le sakate hai
 These three fruits are as follows: bilsdi farrukhabad jile kaa ek gaanv

 Bhutanese refugees are Hindu religious people of Nepali origin who were expelled from Bhutan in the 1990s and forced to leave Bhutan due to Bhutanese policy
 bhutan me do prakaar ke nepali mul ke log hai- ek jo pehle se bhutan me rahete the, doosraa jo 1950 ke dashak main bharat se bhutan main rahane lage
 The development of the Bhutanese Mahayana Buddhist sect, which spread from Tibet to Bhutan, has contributed to the Nepali princess Bhrkuti and the Nepali artist Aranico
 atah, nepali kalakaar tathaa shilpkaar nepal ke madhyayug se hi bhutan main kala, stupa nirmaan aadi ke liye jate the
 People of Nepali origin have a history of living in Bhutan since the 19th century
 bharat ke uttar-purvi 7 rajyon main bhi nepali mul ke log bharat ke swatantraaa se pehle se rahete aa rahe the
 But after the creation of the system giving more rights to the local castes over these states, the lives of the Nepalis living in these places became difficult
 atah, 1950 ke dashak main yah log bhutan ke dakshini bhaag main tathaa nepal, darjeeling, sikkim aadi jagahon par basane lage
 By 1950 these transferred castes also gained citizenship in Nepal and Bhutan
 madhya 1980 dashak main liya gaya bhutani jansankhya tathyank main dekha gaya ki nepali mul ke logon kii jansankhya 40 pratishat ho gaya tha or bhutan ke druk samudaay kii jansankhya vruddhi nepali mul ke jansankhya vruddhi se kam tha
 Shortly after communicating this fact, the Bhutanese government attempted to integrate the Nepalese community into Bhutanese culture
 is prayaas main vidyalayon main se nepali bhashaa kaa pathan roak diya gaya; logon ko daura, dhoti, sadi, kurta aadi ke bajaay bhutani rashtri poshaak pahanane ke liye jod diya gaya
 These new policies were opposed by Nepalese who migrated from India and people of Nepali origin already located in Bhutan
 is virodh kaa netritva bhutan ke naresh ke sallaahkaar technath rijaal nen kiya
 The protest that started with the demand for incorporation of Nepali language, Hinduism, Nepalese culture based on Vedic rites into Bhutanese origin also reached the demand of establishing democracy later

 At the same time, the citizenship of people of Nepalese origin established from India located in southern Bhutan was declared fake
 saath hi me nepali mul ke andolankaareeyon ko bhi gaihr-naagarik ghoshit karke desh nikaala kar diya
 Some people fled Bhutan in fear of repression and action against people of Nepali origin in southern Bhutan
 bharat or bhutan ke maitri sambandh ke kaaran in sharnaarthiyon ko, jiname se bahut andolan main sarik the, bharat me sharan dena kathin ho gaya
 Hence, most of these refugees started living in refugee camps in Nepal's Jhapa district
 nepal raashtra yah samasya ko bhutani aantarik samasya ke rup main lenaa chahta tha kyonki yah samasya nepali naagarik tathaa nepal raashtra se nahin juda tha
 But it became difficult for Nepal to raise one lakh refugees
 saath me, nepali mul, hindu samskruti aadi se sambandhit badhane ke baad 1999 main nepal ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri krishnaprasad bhattarai nen sanyukt raashtra sangh ko is samasya ke bare main soochit kiya
 These refugees, forced to live a refugee's life for years, have established the Bhutanese Communist Party under the influence of Maoists who want to end Bhutan's monarchy and establish a communist republic of Bhutan

 a mixed response to Bhutanese refugees has been seen on this proposal

 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century

 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global

 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language

 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition

 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands

 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain

 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world

 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers

 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date

 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots
 inke baad anya jarmenic bhashaaon kaa number aata he jinka naata thodaa dur kaa he, ve hai, pashchimi europea bhashaayen or uttari jarmenic bhashaayen or farois
 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai 
 shabdaarth vigyaan angreji or uske sambandhiyon ke bich juthi dostiyon kaa kaaran he
 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he

 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable

 Most Latin words are commonly used in formal speech or writing, such as a court or an encyclopedic article
 However, there are other Latin words that are commonly used in general colloquial and do not appear to be too formal; These words are primarily for concepts that no Germanic word has survived
 sandarbh se inkaa talmail behatar hota he or kai maamalon main ye latin bhi prathit nahin hote hai
 For example, all these words are Latin: mountain, valley, river, aunt, uncle, walk, use push and stay

 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface
 aisa anumaan he kii lagbhag 25,000 shabd har saal bhashaa main judate hai
 One consequence of the French influence is that the English vocabulary has been somewhat divided into Germanic and Latin words
 angreji ke 1000 sabase aam shabdon main se 83% or 100 sabase aam main se puure 100 jarmenic hai
 Conversely, most of the more advanced words in subjects like science, philosophy, mathematics come from Latin or Greek

 a large part of the English vocabulary is of French origin, with most of the words coming from anglo-norman

 For example, competition, art, table, publicity, polis, roll, routine, machine, force, and many other words that have either been or are being Englishized; Many are now pronounced under the rules of phonology of English rather than French

 The spelling system, or orthography, is multi-layered
 isamen sthaneey jarmenic pranali ke upar french, greek or latin vartanee ke tatv shaamil hai; bhashaa ke dhwani vigyaan se yah kaaphi hat gaya he
 There is often a considerable difference in the pronunciation and spelling of words
 haalaanki akshar or dhwani algaav main mail nahin khate hai, phir bhi shabd sanrachana, dhwani or lahazon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaye gaye vartanee niyam 75% vishwasaneey hai
 Some phonetic spelling advocates claim that English is more than 80% phonetic

 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task
 greek, french or spanish or kai anya bhashaaon kii tulana main, ek chaatr ko angreji pathan kaa paarangat banane main zyada vakt lagata he
 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main 
debor, cafe, resyum, entry, fiansi or nive jaise shabd aksar donon tareekon se likhe jate hai
 The diacritics are often added to the word to denote them of "high order"

 The scope of this variation is limited to the spelling differences of British and American English
 angreji pathan ko asana karne ke liye iske kuch sarlikrut sanskaran bhi maujuud hai
 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K
 Ogden with limited words and describes it in his book Basic English: a General Introduction with Rules and Grammar

 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English
 ogden ne basic english main aisa koi shabd nahin daalaa jise kuch anya shabdon ke saath bolaa ja sake or anya bhashaaon ke vaktaaon ke liye bhi ye shabd kaam karen, is baat kaa bhi usne khyaal rakhaa

 sarlikrut angreji main anumodith shabdon kaa ek shabdkosh he or un shabdon ko kuch vishisht myanon main hi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the word close may be used in the phrase "close the door" but "do not go close to the landing gear"
 angrezon ne duniya ke anek deshon ko raajnneetik rup se apana upnivesh banaaya
 Along with this, they also imposed English cleverly on those countries

 English has severely paralyzed the native languages here
 british counsil jaisi santhaayen is angrezi ke prasar ke liye tarah-tarah ke dushprachaar evam gupt abhiyaan karti rahati hai
 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency
