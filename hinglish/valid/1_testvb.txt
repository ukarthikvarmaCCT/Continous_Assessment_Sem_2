 Open economy is a philosophy of economy
 khuli arthvyavastha ko agar uske shabdic arth se samajhen to iskaa matlab hota he ek aisa desh yaa samaaj jahaan kisi ko kisi se bhi vyapaar karne kii chhot hoti he or aisa bhi nahi ki is vyapaar pe koi sarkari ankush yaa niyantran nahi hota
 But the government makes such policies so that common people can easily start industries and other types of business
 aisi arthvyavastha me vyapaaron ko swatantra rup se phalne-phoolne diya jaataa he
 Government controls are made in such a way that the businesses are prevented from any kind of dishonesty, but the control is not tightened so much that there is inconvenience in the honest business
 khuli arthvyavastha na keval us samaaj ya desh ke andruni vyapaar ke liye hoti he balki bahari vyapaar ko bhi usee drushti se dekha jaataa he
 The idea of open economy is not new in India
 itihaas ko dhyaan se padhane pe pataa he ki aadi kaal se bharat me vyapaar ke liye khuli arthvyavastha kii niti thi
 During the time of Chandragupta Maurya, trade in India came from China and from Europe
 resham maarg antatrashtriya vyapaar me bharat ke yogdan kaa ek udhaaharan he
 During the time of Chandragupta Maurya and Emperor Ashoka, wood was traded
 akbar se samay main bharat me vyapaar kaaphi faltaa-phulataa tha
 The British also came to do business in India
 matlab 1700-1800 me bhi bharat me videshi mul ke vyapaariyon se vyapaar hota tha
 Probably, with the East India Company becoming part of businessmen, there was a perception in Indian society that trade was not supported by more leaders in India when India became independent in 1947
 bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri pan nehru roosi samaajwaad se kaaphi prabhavit the
 After independence, Nehru tried to establish socialism in India
 shaayad ye bharat kii arthvyavastha ke kshetra me sabase badi bhul thi
 India did not have an open economy from 1947 to 1990
 bharat ne aayaat or niryaat pe kayi tarah ke kar lagaaye jate the
 Due to taxes on exports, the Indian industry did not find cheap goods sold here in the international market
 antar-rashtreey bazaar kii pratispardhaa me bhartiya udyogon ke naa tik paane se bharat peeche rah gaya
 During this time, countries like Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan made their way into the international market
 bharat me aayaat par bhi kaaphi kar lagaaye jate the
 For this reason, foreign industries used to have difficulty in selling their goods in India
 videshon bane samaan bharat me bahut mahange hone kii vajah se bharat me zyaada log kharid nahi pate the
 Those who were born outside of India could not easily reach the people of India
 isse ek taraf to bharat ke naagarik 1947 se 1980'za tak computer, aadhunik ghadiyon, aadhunik telephone, kaaron, ityadi se vanchit rah gayi to duusari taraf bhartiya udyogon ko zaruri takniken nahi mil payi
 Due to non-production of products through international and technical methods, many of India's industries like textiles, agriculture, aviation, manufacturing, etc
 were lagging behind international standards
 bharat kaa growth rate kareeb 3
0% rah gaya or ise vishwa me hindu growth rate se janaa jane laga
 Due to the non-development of India's industries, all the people of India remained below the poverty line
 is dauraan bharat ke moolbhoot dhaanche kaa bahut dhimi gati se vikaas hua
 India's electricity, water, roads, information system, etc
 have been deteriorating
 mudrasphiti kii dar bahut zyaada hone se mahangaai kaphi badhti chali gayi par udyogon kii biimaar haalat ke chalate logo kii aamadani mudrasphiti dar ke baraabar na batch saki
 The problem of balance of payment started in India from 1985
 1991 me chandrasekhar sarkaar ke shashan ke dauraan bharat me belans ouf pement kii samasya ne vikaraal rup dhaaran kiya or bharat kii pehle se charmaraayi hui arthvyavastha ghutno pe aa gayi
 Foreign exchange reserves in India remained at par for only three weeks of imports
 ye ek bahut hi gambheer samasya thi
 During this time the problem had become so serious that India had exhausted the necessary funds to run the country
 bharat sarkaar ne apane swarna bhandar se sona bank off england ke paas girvee rakhane kii taiyaariyaan shuru kar di thi
 The Indian government led by Narsimha Rao decided to undertake large-scale economic reforms in India
 udaarikaran kahlane vaale in sudhaaro ke architect the manmohan singh
 In the coming times, Manmohan Singh started to change India's economy completely
 ye voh samay tha jabaki bharat ne apni arthvyavastha ko khulaa karne kii shuruyaat kii
 The economic reforms done since 1990, from the perspective of most people, gave India the status of a strong economic country in the world

 In the present era, the internal combustion engines used in cars, trucks, motorcycles and aircraft, etc
, are usually four stroke engines
 'chaar stroke' kaa matlab he ki eendhan se yantric urja main parivartan kaa chakra kul chaar charnon main puraa hota he
 These steps or strokes are called intake, compression, combustion, and emission, respectively
 dhyaan dene kii baat he ki in chaar charnon ko puraa karne main cranksashaft ko do chakkar lagane padate hai
 Currently, four stroke engines are commonly used in trains
 isse pehle gadiyon main tu stroke ingine kaa prayog hua karata tha, lekin kam milage or jivan avadhi kam hone ke kaaran iskaa sthaan four stroke ingine ne le liya
 The four-stroke engine was first patented in 1854 by Eugenio Baranti and Felice Matuacci
 iske baad 1860 main iskaa pratham prototip nikaala
 French engineer Alphonse Beau de Roca also independently explored the theory and extracted it in 1861 in his paper
 german ejeeniyar nicholas aato ne 1876 main is ingine kaa kaaryshil praturup nikaala
 For this reason, the four-stroke principle today is called auto-cycle and the spark plugs used in this engine are often called auto engines
 auto-chakra main jhadiabetic sampeedan, sthir aaytan par ooshmaa sangyojan, jhadiabatic vistaar evam sthir aaytan par ooshmaa asweekruti charan aate hai
 a four-stroke engine undergoes a complete cycle, ie four processes at a time
 jinhen angrezi main stroke kaha jaataa he
 Each engine has a hollow cylinder, called a cylinder
 silinder ke bheetar ek piston chalata he, jise ham mushali kah sakate hai
 The work of this piston is exactly the same as that of the stopper within the childrens playing paint
 piston aluminium yaa ispaat kaa banataa he or isamen ispaat kii kamanidaar chudiyaan lagi rahati hai, jisase vaayu yaa gas, piston ke ek ore se duusari ore nahin ja sakati
 The cylinder forehead is closed, but it has two valves
 ek ke khulne par vaayu, yaa vaayu or petrol kaa mishran, bheetar aa sakate hai
 The air or gas inside the cylinder may exit when the other is opened
 maathe main ek spark plag bhi laga rahata he jiske sire par do taar hote hai
 At the appropriate time, a spark of light emits between these two wires, which is automatically controlled when the engine is running
 crank kaa kaam he piston ke aage peeche chalane kii gati ko dhuree ke akshaghurnan main badalata
 The crank rotates when the piston moves back and forth due to the crank
 idhan ke baar-baar jalane se piston bahut garam na ho jaae is vichaar se silinder kii deevaaren hoti hai or unke bich pump dwaara pani pravaahit hota rahata he
 In motorcar etc
, there are four, six or eight cylinders instead of one, and the iron feature in which they remain is called a block
 upar bataae gaye valve, kamaani ke kaaran chipakkar, vaayu aadi ke maarg ko band rakhte hai, parantu valve cam dwaara uchit samay par uth jaataa he, jisase vaayu yaa gas ke aane kaa maarg khul jaataa he
 The spindle on which the cam is mounted is called cam-axle
 yah dhuree ingine se hi chalati rahati he or vaalvon ko uchit samayon par kholti rahati he
 The valve remains closed if it stays under; The valve rises when its long section rotates and falls under the stem of the valve
 ) It is absolutely necessary to keep several oil treaties, where one body rotates or moves on the other, to be dampened with equal oil
 isiliye sarvatra snehak tel pahunchaane kaa prabandh rahata he
 In motorcars, the lower part of the engine is often in the form of a platter in which oil is poured
 prayek chakkar main crank tel main dub jaataa he or chhinte udaakar silinder ko bhi tel se tar kar detaa he
 Pumping is done to deliver oil to other places
 chaturghaat chakra ke anusaar kaam karanevaale injanon main piston ke chaar baar chalane par iske kaarykram kaa ek chakra puraa hota he
 These four are the following: ab flihil kii jhonk se phir piston vaayu or petrol chusata he, use sampidit karata he, idhan jalakar shakti utpann karata he or jali gaisen baahar nikalati hai 
 This sequence continues until the sparks are closed by closing the switch

 Four stroke engines have many benefits
 yah ingine kii shakti dakshata ko badhaata he
 This improves the efficiency of the car
 tu-stroke kii apeksha ingine main kam garmi paidaa hoti he
 Full use of energy increases the lifespan of the engine and throws out less smoke
 is prakaar ingine kii kshamta ke saath-saath hi utsarjan bhi apekshkrit kam hota he
 In a two-stroke engine, both cycles of energy are completed in a single cycle of the crack-shaft, whereas in a four-stroke engine, two cycles of the crank-shaft can complete four cycles of energy
 isse chaturghaati ingine main balaghurna kaa utaachadhaav hota rahata he
 Separate lubrication oil is transported for the fluidity of the rotating parts in four exhaust engines and to protect them from rubbing and friction

 The most external electrons in filling these elements are characterized by the p-orbital of their atoms
 Some of these elements and their compounds play an important role in our daily lives
 udhaaharan ke liye:nitrogen ammonia, nitric amla or urvarkon ke nirmaan main prayog kiya jaataa he
 Trinitrotoluene, nitroglycrine, etc

 The element of the p-block of the atomic radius generally decreases over the period running from left to right throughout the periodic table
 yah isliye he ki electronon ke alaavaaleta he jagah main ek hi dipti khol or kii ek vruddhi hui pul karne ke liye adheen hamprayek charan main parmaanu prabharee
 As a group is moving down, the atomic radius of the elements increases as the atom increases

 It is measured in kj mol-1 and is known as the first ion synchronization enthalpy
 The first ion synchronization enthalpy of P-block elements generally increases with a period from left to right
 yah he kyonki ke rup main ham ek avadhi ke saath dayee ore se bain ore le jaenparmaanu kaa aakaar ghataata he
 Electrons are tightly held in a small atom
 bada parmaanu,kam dridhtaa se electronon nabhik dwaara yojit kar rahe hai
 Ion synchronization enthalpy, therefore, increases with decrease in atomic size
 haalanki, vahaan kuch apwaad hai, jaise,pehali ynsinkranizeshan enthalapi ek samooh 16 tatv ke ek samooh 15 tatv kii tulana main kam he
 This is because in the case of a group 15 element, the electron can be extracted from a half-filled p orbital
 saamaanya main ek niyamit rup se tarika he par ek samooh avarohi kram main pehali ynsinkranizeshan enthalapi ghat jaati he
 This is because as a group descends, the size of an atom increases
 ek parinaam ke rup main electronon kam kas hai nabhik dwaara yojit or isliye, pehla ynsinkranizeshan enthalapi ghat jaati he
 When an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom, heat energy is either released or absorbed

 But for some atoms the electron gain enthalpy is absorbed during the addition of a positive quantity, ie, an electron
 electron sambadh aam taur par sahi saath karne ke liye bain ore se le jane or adhik nakaaratmak ho jaataa he ek avadhi
 This is because moving across a period decreases the size of the atom

 Consequently, the atom has a greater tendency to gain one electron
 isliye, electron laabh enthalapi ho jaataa haddhik nakaaratmak
 With one group moving down, the electron gain enthalpy becomes less negative

 Therefore, the electron gain enthalpy becomes less negative
 lekin halojan samooh main, electron laabh enthalapi chlorine kii tulana adhik nakaaratmak he fluorine ke
 This is because the size of the f atom is very small, which makes the addition of electrons less favorable due to the electronic repulsion inter

 The metallic and non-metallic characters of the P-block elements vary as follows: the metallic character increases with duration, while the non-metallic character decreases
 kii avadhi bhar main chal rahaa he, parmaanu aakaar ke kaaran kam ho jaati he, kyonki yah he parmaanu prabharee vruddhi hui he or isliye, ynsinkranizeshan urja bad jaati he
 While the metal character carrying down group increases, the non-metallic character decreases
 yah he kyonki ek samooh neeche le jane parmaanu aakaar bad jaati he
 As a result, the synchronization energy is reduced and the tendency of electrons to decrease is increased
 isliye, dhaatucharitra bad jaati he or gaiyr-dhatvik charitra ghat jaati he
 The heterogeneous behavior of the first element in each group of p-blocks contains elements called s-blocks and p-blocks are the main groups or representative elements

 Damascus University ; The University of Damascus is Syria's largest and oldest university located in the Syrian capital Damascus and has branches in other Syrian cities
 It was established in 1903 AD through the merger of the School of Medicine and the Law Institute in 1913 AD By 1958, the name of the Syrian University was recognized but after the establishment of Alappo University it was changed to Damascus University
 Damascus University, which is currently also known as Damascus University, the entire education system in Syria was dramatically humiliated during former President Hafiz al-assad and after him, during the regime of Bashar al-assad, this university was in Dunia and Arabia
 There used to be a leading university in the world but during the Syrian civil war the current ranking is 4152 and Arab world Ranking 114th in India
 
 The establishment of a school of medicine in Damascus was approved in 1901, after which it was established as the Syrian University in 1903 AD and in the year 1958 it was renamed Damascus University

26389 The method is an act of social control
 yah niyantran aachaar vyavhaar ke ve adhikrut niyam hai jo saamaajik jivan main sahaj suvidha or sulabh shanti prastut kar uski ruparekha nirdhaarit karte hai
 The method is humanized, only a means for its convenience, no divine or external facts
 falat: manushya vidhi ke liye nahin varan vidhi manushya ke liye he - yadhyapi vidhi samaaj ko niyantrit karti he, tathaapi yah niyantrabandhan samaaj kii ichha ke anusaar hota he
 The collective will of the society has always been a valid force in some form or the other in the period of social control
 janamat vah sangathit shakti he jo samaaj ke satat maanya paramparaagat aadarshon or anubhutiyon kaa praturup hoti he evam us samaaj kii taatkaalik bhaawanaaon kaa bhi pratinidhitiv karti he
 Public opinion is of two types, static and static
 pravagic janamat paramparaagat roodhiyon tathaa adarsh or vyavhaar par aadhaarit hota he, sthitik janamat sthaayee bhaavana udgaaron evam unke vigyaapan se sambandhit hota he
 Therefore, it keeps on taking a new form every day, calling for religion, the charm of exclusive courage or the elegance of inspirational literature has been instrumental or instrumental in creating public opinion from time to time according to the country
 beesvin shatabdi ke yantrayug main patrakarita janamat ko mukherit karne main mukhya: bhaagi he
 It is an irrefutable truth that the formation of social institutions has depended on the beliefs and feelings of society
 vidhi saamaajik suvidha hetu niyantranpranali hone ke naate ek saamaajik sanstha he
 For this reason, the legislator or the authority always gets strength from public opinion
 vidhi ke sampark main janamat kaa abhipraay he lok sajagata evam satarkta jo vidhi kaa auchity santulit kar yah nishchit kar sake ki koun vidhinium hitkaari he or nirmit karne yogya he or koun vidhinium lok hitkaari nahin he isliye nishkrut kar dene yogya he
 Public opinion of this waking state should be the basis of law
 kintu aisa praaia: hota nahin, bahudhaa trutipurna janamat vidhi kaa aadhaar hota he
 The reason for such misleading public opinion is sometimes both ignorance and fear - just as the method of slavery in ancient times was built on public opinion, but this poll was flawed, ignorance and fear mixed grounds
 aise mat ko vaastavik arth main janamat kahana hi vyarth he
 Aware, curious opinion is the only real opinion that can be actionable in relation to law
 iskaa abhaav praaia: isliye hota he ki har desh yaa samaaj main itani taarkik sajagata nahin hoti
 Most human beings work not by thinking but by orthodox practices and emotions
 aisi sthiti main bauddhik vivechna ke liye sthaan hi nahin hota-bahudhaa aise bhi drushtaant milte hai jahaan vidhinirmaan athwa parivartan jansadharan ke bahumat ke nitant viruddh hue hai
 These laws were made with the efforts of one or a few individuals
 kahin yah isliye sambhav hua ki in gine chune vyaktiyon yaa ek vyakti kaa vyaktitv itnaa ospurn tha ki vah prabhaavshaalee bana, kahin sampurna samaaj kaa itnaa durbal str tha ki ve safal ho gaye
 In India, harmful laws were being created against Indians in the British state, due to the collective weakness of the country
 turkistan main kamaal pasha ataturk ne akele vidhisanchaalan kiya jo desh kii bhaawanaaon ke viruddh tha, uskaa kaaran uskaa nijee vyaktitv tha
 It is so important that most of such people do not get the opinion of Kaal or Yuga even though they do not get public opinion
 is yugakalin bahumat ke aadhaar par hi inaki vidhirachana safal ho paati he
 Abraham was not a landowner of South America with Lincoln, but he was able to devise a method of eradicating slavery, he said
 anubhav se gyaat hota he ki yug kii vaani yaa shatabdi kaa janamat desh yaa sthaan ke janamat se adhik prabhaavasheel, shaktiman or kriyaatmak hota he
 It is hardly possible that any legislation can be successful in opposing the majority of both the countries
 bharat ke itihaas main ati vidvan or ati asafal samrat mohammad tughlaq kaa drushtaant is baat kaa dyotak he
 His reforms were very fundamental, but were beyond the majority of both the country and period, so they failed
 praaia: desh main samuchit pratinidhitivvaale vidhanmandal kii anupasthiti bhi vidhi main janamat kaa abhaav utpann kar detii he
 Such a situation is rebellious
 france or america donon deshon main isi prakaar uchit pratinidhitivyukt vidhanmandal ke abhaav ke kaaran janamat ke viruddh vidhinirmaan hota rahaa jiskaa ant vidroh or viplav main hua
 These examples prove that in many situations, in the real sense, public opinion does not have a basis
 iske atirikt yah bhi satya he ki yatharth main kisi bhi samaaj main saamaajik jivan main kriyasheel bhaag lenevaale vyakti purna samudaay nahin, thode se log hi hote hai
 Their opinion is influential in construction
 vaise is sakriy samooh ko aganit akriy saamaajik ikaayiyon kaa sadaa bhay bana rahata he ki kahin inaki koi cheshtaa us brihat jansamaj kii manyataon ke itane viruddh na ho ki vah vidroh kar uthe
 Hence, the public opinion on which the legislature is based is usually a wonderful mixture or compromise between the intellectual thinking of the social rulers and the sentiments of the general public
 is samjhaute kaa rup nishchay hi donon virgon kii nijee shakti par nirbhar karata he
 The public consciousness of Britain was so vigilant that even the new Tithipatri was opposed and there was no opposition to any law made against Indians in the British state in India or against the Indian tradition in self-rule, marriage, joint family and adoptive rights
 
 iskaa kaaran keval bhartiya jansadharan kii akriyaatmak supt manodasha he
 Here again, the force of the era of public opinion is evident in the origin of these laws
 prashn kaa doosraa rup yah bhi he ki anek kaaran or preranaayen ek ore apana mahatv rakhti hai or manushya kii nijee swaarth prerana duusari or apana prabhaav or mahatv rakhti he
 Individuals are legal and their nature is human at the time of legalization, not of a heretic
 itihaas iskaa sakshi he ki adikaal se vidhiniyamon se vyaktivishesh yaa samoohvishesh kaa hit or swaarth sadaa ankit rahata he
 Rights become the target of the interest of a particular group
 madhyakaalin shatabdi yug bhuswamiyon kaa tha, us kaal kii vidhirachana main bhuswamiyon ke hit purnataya surakshit hai
 In the method of colonies and subterranean parts, the white class has self-protective rules
 yah samooh kabhi saamaajik or kabhi raajnneetik varg ke hote hai jinke vash main vidhirachana hoti he kintu in samudaayon kaa nijee swaarth kaa drushtikon bhi tatkaaleen vaataavaran, evam yug kii vaani ke anuroop hi hona swaabhaavik he
 Therefore, in the end, the form of the law is always determined by some kind of era, period or environment and opinion of the country and it is clearly proved that the basis of the law is public opinion

 He also received the venerable title of "lokmanya", which means accepted by the people

 The news of this Dhukhad news came from a letter he received in jail
 or tilak ko is baat kaa behad afsos tha kii ve apni mratak patni ke antim darshan bhi nahin kar sakate
 Lala Lajpat Rai founded the Home Rule League with the help of Annie Besant
 It was not like a Satyagraha movement
 It consisted of forming groups of four or five people who would meet with big politicians and lawyers all over India and explain the meaning of Home Rule League
 The Annie Besant who came to India from Ireland, he saw the experiment there like the Homerule League, he thought of doing the same experiment in India

 san 1919 i
 main congress kii amritsar baithak main hissaa lene ke liye swadesh lautne ke samay tak tilak itane naram ho gayi the ki unhone montegue-chamsford sudhaaron ke zariye sthapit legislative concil ke chunaav ke bahishkaar kii gandhi kii niti kaa virodh hi nahin kiya
 Instead, Tilak advised the delegates to follow their policy of responsive cooperation to implement the reforms that initiated the participation of Indians to some extent in regional governments
 lekin naye sudhaaron ko nirnaayak disha dene se pehle hi 1 agast,1920 i
 ko bombay main unki mrityu ho gayi
 Posthumously paying tribute, Gandhiji called him the creator of modern India and Jawaharlal Nehru called him the father of Indian revolution
 "swaraj meraa janmasiddh adhikaar he or main ise lekar rahoonga" kaa naare dene vaale swatantraaa ke mahanayake gangadhar tilak kaa 1 agast,1920 i

 Tilak wrote many books like this, but the gita-rahasya written in Mandalay jail is the best for the interpretation of Srimadbhavadgita which has been translated into many languages
 unki likhi hui sabhi pustakon kaa vivaran is prakaar he- All his books were first published in Marathi, English and Hindi from Lokmanya Tilak Temple, Narayan Paith, Pune
 baad main unhen anya prakashkon ne bhi chapa
 This temple is located in the fort of Chaugan
 mahavir swami kaa yah mandir 1493 i
 ke baad kaa bana hua he
 Its architecture is simple as compared to other temples
 sambhraant varg yaa filit samajashaastra or raajnneeti main kisi samaaj yaa samudaay main us chote se gut ko kehete hai jo apni sankhya se kahin zyaada dhan, rajnatik shakti yaa saamaajik prabhaav rakhata he
 The elite is more powerful in its field than other sections of society
 saamaajik jivan ke kisi bhi kshetra main niyantrankari sanrachanaon ke sheersh par maujuud chote se or apekshaakrit samroop samooh ko abhijan kii sangya di jaati he
 The Latin word 'ELITE', synonymous with it, means chosen or best
 ilit banane ke liye liye satta, suvidha, yogyata or sanghathan or netritvkaari kshamta hona anivaary he
 In order to continue any system or system, it is considered necessary to run the operations of a group of well-qualified persons and from time to time, people with similar abilities are selected to take their place
 yah aagrah sheersh yaa netritv main abhijan kii nirantarata kii guarantee karata he
 Elite's interpreter Pareto says that Elite possesses special psychological qualities based on power, using notoriety, deceit, strength, and judicious initiative
 chunki abhijanon kaa gut chota sa hota he isliye use adhik sangathit or susangat rup se karrwai karne main aasaani hoti he
 Its members maintain constant contact with each other, so that the policy-making process is not interrupted on the basis of mutual consensus
 aisi baat nahin ki abhijan hameshaa hi apni satta bachaane main kaamyaab rahete hon
 The blame for their failure is usually attributed to lack of political skill or will power
 samaaj ke saath jeevant sampark rakhte hue naye vichaaron ko grahan karke apana punarsanskaar karte rahane vaale abhijan lambe arase tak tike rahete hai
 Those elites who do not do so, their time is over and the counter-elite standing against them takes power from their hands, leading a 'mass' or mass group
 shuru main abhijan siddhanth ek loktantr virdohi avadharana thi jiskaa sutrikaran shaskaon ke praadhikaar ko nyaaysangat tehraane ke kiya gaya tha taaki europe kii viksit ho rahi loktantric shashan paddati kii vaidhata ko chunauti di ja sake
 Later in the middle of the twentieth century, the insights of this theory were tried to confirm the democratic theory
 iske peeche makasad samyavaadee yaa fasivadi netritv main chal rahe janandolanon se udaarataavaadi loktantr ko bachaana tha
 In democracy, not all the elite are in power
 aaj kii loktantric vyavasthaaon main abhijanon ke kai samooh satta kii bagdor apane haath main rakhane ke liye aapas main pratiyogita karte hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 In order to join the membership of the already frozen elite group, new ones keep coming on the platform of democracy
 shuru main abhijanon kaa chayan keval ucch varg se hi kiya jaataa tha, lekin ab nichle or vanchit samajhe jane vaale tabakon kii netritvkaari shaktiyaan bhi abhijanon kii shrenee main shaamil kar lee jaati hai
 And that democracy is considered more successful and sustainable whose size of the elites keeps increasing
 iske vipareet jahaan abhijan apana aakaar badhane ke kilaaf morchabandi kar lete hai, un loktantron main vyavastha baar-baar sankatagrast hoti rahati he
 The eligibility principle is fundamentally based on the ancient belief that society is divided into a handful of rulers and majority ruled
 plato ne shashan karne ke liye aise logon kii shinaakht karne kaa suzav diya tha jinke paas hukumat karne ke liye aavashyak prakruti-pradutt yogyataayen hon
 It is a prevalent way of understanding history and politics to study the elites who have decision-making powers for the operation of various sectors of society
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main italvi samajashastriyon getano moska or wilfredo parato ke saath- saath moska ke german anuyaayi robert michels ne loktantric vyavasthaaon ke vikaas ke kilaaf pratikriya karte hue daawa kiya abhijanon kaa shashan maanviya itihaas ek pramukh lakshan he
 This formulation was against the egalitarian one promoted and confirmed by Marxism in the nineteenth century
 ye siddhantkaar marks se is bare main to sahamat the ki ateet main samaajon kaa netritv alpsankhyakon ke haathon main rahaa he, par unka yah bhi kahana tha ki ye alpsankhyak samooh anivaary taur par utpaadan ke sadhano ke swami nahin the
 The source of their dominance was not economic, rather their power came from diverse sources
 yah alag baat he ki apane prabhutv kaa laabh uthaa kar abhijan bade paimaane par dhan-sampatti jamaa kar lete the
 Mosca and Pareto also said that the pattern of leadership of future societies is going to remain the same
 haalaanki in vidwaanon ne aagrahpurvak kaha ki unka samaaj-vigyaan kisi mulya se bandhaa hua nahin he, par italy main ubharate hue fasiwad ke prati unki hamadardi kisi se chhipi hui nahin thi
 Pareto and Michaels were straightforward supporters of fascism and viewed fascism as a compulsion due to their resentment from the liberal Mosca Left
 kul mila kar in teenon siddhantkaron kii koshish thi ki sansadeey vyavastha keval ucch or madhyavarg kii bhagidaari tak hi simit rahani chahie
 He used to look at the Parliament representing workers and peasants contemptuously
 marxvaadi siddhantkaron or loktantric bahultawad ke pairokaron ne is abhijanwaad ko kadi chunauti di
 Marxists said that this theory failed to identify the basic basis of the dominance of the elite
 abhijan chaahe faujee hon, dharmik hon, raajnneetik hon yaa saanskrithik; unke prabhutv kii buniyaad aarthik varg-sambandhon main dekhi jaani chahie
 Pluralists argued that in modern, developed and liberal societies there is competition between diverse interests for power and domination
 isliye mutthi bhar abhijanon kaa gut sarvangin prabhutv kabhi sthapit nahin kar paata
 The decision making process is not just one
 is hakeekat ke vipareet abhijanwaad ke pairokaar udaarataavaad ke aadhaar par khadey samaajon main satta or uske sroton kaa adhyayan karne ke liye trutipurna paddati apanaate hai
 Although the elitism doctrine was anti-democracy, Joseph Schumpeter incorporated the elitist doctrine into elitist democratic theory in the mid-twentieth century
 unhone kaha ki loktantr main bhi shashan abhijanon ke haath main hi rahanaa chahie taaki vyavastha ko prabhavi or sthir hukmran lagaataar milte rahen
 The only condition is that such elites are selected through democratic processes
 yah vaicharik ejineering karne ke peeche shumpiter kaa uddeshy udaarataavaadi loktantr ko fasiwad athwa communism kaa samarthan karne vaale vyavastha-virdohi abhijanon ke netritv main chalane vaale andolanon se bachaana tha
 Taking a pluralistic theory, Schumpeter said that the liberal claim of power and multidimensionality of decision is not correct
 darasal prabhutv ke liye aapas main hode karne vaale samoohon kaa niyantran kuch thode se netaaon ke haath main rahata he jo aavashyak nahin ki apane samooh ke sadasyon kii ichchhaaon or zaruuraton ke hisaab se hi chalate hon
 Hence the competition between groups becomes a competition between their leaders
 nattejey taur bahultavaadi loktantr abhijanvaadee loktantr main badal jaataa he
 The sustainability and development of this idea of democracy is the result of the activism and commitment of its relatives, not dependent on the passive civil society
 loktantric vyavastha ho yaa nirankushta, abhijanon ke mahatva se puri tarah se inkaar karnaa mushkil he
 Some scholars argue that the interpreters of liberal democracy pay more attention to decisions taken under the influence of the masses
 is tarah abhijanon dwaara lee gayi pahalakadamiyon kii bhoomika par puraa prakaash nahin pad paata
 Sociologists interested in elite studies study the social and educational backgrounds of leaders from various walks of social life to find out what factors influence them in the elites
 agar samaaj ke kisi hisse main ek se zyaada abhijan samooh sakriy hai to yah pataa lagaaya jaataa he ki unke bich kis tarah kaa saamaajik, raajnneetik, aarthik or vichaardhaaratmak antarsambandh he; or unamem ekikrut hone kii sambhaavnaayen hai yaa nahin
 a second dimension of elite study is the study of relationships between the elite and the public
 isamen yah jaanane kii koshish kii jaati he ki upar se neeche or neeche se upar is tarah ke sambandh kaa sanchaar kis tarah hota he
 The drawbacks of this relationship determine the status of the forces that wish to replace the elite
 is vishleshan se hi tay hota he ki kisi vishisht abhijan ko hataane ke liye shantipurna yaa krantikari tareekon ke peeche kya kaaran kaam kar rahe the
 C
 Wright Mills, who studies American elite, has formulated the concept of 'power Elite'
 mills ke anusaar sanyukt rajya america main teen tarah ke abhijan ekikrut ho kar hukumat karte hai
 These are industrial, political military
 dilachasp baat yah he ki anya siddhantkaron ke vipareet mills yah dikhaate hai ki abhijanon kii is tikdi se mil kar banane vaala power ilit loktantr ke liye kis tarah se nuksaandeh he
 The elite theory has also interfered in the field of culture-studies
 maas socity ke ubhaar kii aalochana karne vaale yah maan kar chalate hai ki samakaleen maas media or usase nikalne vaali lokapriy jan-samskruti abhijan samskruti kii shreshthata ke liye ghaatak hoti he
 Elite classes can be of many types, for example - aksar kisi ek prakaar ke sambhraant varg kaa sadsy anya kshetron ke sambhraant virgon kaa sadsy bhi hota he
 For example, it has been observed that in many societies, the best education, the most wealth and the greatest political power are found in the people of the same class

 khoonibed-motowak, yamakeshwar tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat gadhwal mandal ke paudi jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The categories of stars in astronomy are based on the spectrum of light coming from them
 is varnakram se yah zaahir ho jaataa he ki taare kaa taapmaana kya he or uske andar koun se rasinic tatv maujuud hai
 Most alphabetically based categories are given as O, B, A, F, G, k and m letter names of English- dhyaan rahe ke kisi darshak ko in taron ke rang inaki shrenee ke bataae gaye rangon se alag prathit ho sakate hai
 a letter from zero to nine is also associated with these letters for categorization of stars, indicating the location of the star in the interval of two letters
 jaise ki "A5" kaa sthaan "A0" or "F0" ke thik bich main he
 a Roman numeral is also added behind these letters and numerals, which is I, II, III, IV or V
 agar koi tara mahadaanav ho to use i kaa roman ank miltaa he
 III means that the star is a demon star and v means that it is a dwarf star
 hamaare suraj ki shrenee G2V he, yaahi yah ek pilaa bouna tara he jo 2 qadam naarangi taare kii taraf he
 The brightest star in the sky, the hunter, is ranked A1V
 harvard vidhi boune taron ko shreniyon main baantne kaa ek tareeqa he
 It has been seen that the more the star turns towards blue, the hotter it gets and the bigger it gets
 neeche dikhaaya gaya he ke alag shreniyon ke taron kaa kya taapmaana hota he or hamaare suraj kii tulana main kya aakaar or chamkilaapan hota he
 Note that this is only valid for the strings of the main sequence - 1880 i ke baad ke kaal main harvard vishvavidhyalay kii vedhashala main kaam kar rahe vaigyanikon ne sitaron kii 'A' se lekar 'O' tak shreniyan banaai
 But in the 1920s the Indian astronomer Meghnad Saha showed a relationship between the spectrum of stars and their surface temperature
 jaise-jaise is kshetra main gyaan badhata gaya, vaigyanikon ne shreniyan taapmaana ke anusaar badal di or jahaan do shreniyan vastav main ek hi taapmaana ke taron ke bare main thi unhen vilay karke ek shrenee hataa di gayi 
 The study of Saha and other scientists made it clear that OBAFGKM are actually surface temperature ranges
 1943 main yarkis vedhashala main kaam kar rahe teen vaigyanikon ne taron ke varnakram kii ek nayi shreneekaran vidhi banaai
 The names of these scientists were William Wilson Morgan, Philippe C
 Keenan and Edith Calman, so the system is also called the "MKK" method, which is formed by adding the first English letters to their last names
 jahaan harvard shreneekaran sirf satahi taapmaana ke hisaab se chalata he or keval boune taron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he vahaan yarkis shreneekaran main satahi taapmaana or chamak donon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or yah sabhi taron kaa shreneekaran karte hai
 Monster stars have the same mass as dwarf stars, but their diameter is greater than dwarf stars
 isliye daanav taron kii sataha par gurutvkarshan, gas kaa ghanatv or dabaav teenon boune taron se bahut kam hote hai
 This difference can be seen to have a significant impact on the spectrum
 boune taron ke zyaada dabaav kii vajah se unke varnakram kii laqiren "fail" jaati hai
 According to the gloss, the yurkese method has these categories - gammak kaa matlab he 'alankaran'
 The use of gammak is found in the performance of Indian classical music
 gammak ko 'gammka' or 'gammakam' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 a gammak is called a musical voice in which a beautiful palette or curvature is given while singing or playing a melody or vocal group, which enhances the personality of a raga
 har raag ke adwitiya charitra ke peeche, us me prayog kiye gayi gammakon kaa haath hota he
 That is why gammak is not only for decoration in music, they are also more essential in the Indian scripture
 lagbhag har ek sangeet nibandh me gammakon ke varnan ke liye ek alag anubhag likhaa jaataa he
 In Sanskrit, gammak means 'ornate vowel'
 gammak me swar kii avritti ko bhaari or shashakt companon ke dwaara sate hue or dur ke swaron ke bich main kisi nirdhaarit swar ko parivartit kiya jaataa he
 Each raga has different rules about the type of gammak and its application, which applies to a specific type of music
 gammak shaastra sangeet ke 'manodharm sangeet' vibhaag ke mukhya pahalu main se ek he, jis main 22 sookshm sur or shrutiyaan lagati he
 The vocals of any raga must be accompanied by their appropriate vocals because the voice itself is not a discreet tone but a volume that reflects the melodious movements of some music
 gammak keval alankaran hi nahi he
 It is also a fundamental part of the raga
 kisi bhi sangeet swar ko ek gammak sajivan karte hue use gati pradaan karati he
 In Hindustani classical music, there are 5 types of gammak in Hindustani music: hindustani sangeet main gammak, mind yaa andolan ke samaan he
 Gammakkarnataka in Carnatic music has Gammakas divided into three major groups: in teen prakaaron main bhi kai upaprakaar maujuud he: Subtype jaaru:• irkk jaaru- utaar• etra jaaru- chadhaav Gmmka: • Nokku - pressure from above • Odukkal - pressure from below • Staggered - oscillation • Orica - jerking janta:• ravai- upar se palata• sfoorit- neeche se dabaav • pratyahata-upar se dabaav • khandippu- teevr swar balaghat The classification of gammakas has been a main topic of debate in the Sangeath demolitions for many years
 gammak vargeekaran ke anek pranaaliyon main se aaj, 'dashavidha' yaa gammak ke das roopon kii pranali sabse sulabh or sweekrut he
 Apart from this, Venkat Makhai has developed a system of 15 Gammakas: || Tirupah Supplementhave vibrato linamitapi agitato valishchata trinbinah kurulahtou ullasitah plavitschah humpitto mudritastha nomo egyptitschetti bheedah panchadas smritah || is shloke ko 'panchdasa gammak' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 In this verse 15 songs have been given which is, Tirupam - Singing a single note with pressure, Sphurit - When someone makes a noise, press on the second note, The vibrating sound, Lean - When a tone Gradually dissolve in the second note, agitated - swinging from one place to another, volley, triangulation - when three different notes are played simultaneously, kurul, hurt, hilarious, flushed, gumped, printed, nominated and erased
