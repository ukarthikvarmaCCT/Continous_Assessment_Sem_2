 Richard Dawkins (born 26 March 1941) is a British evolutionary biologist and author
 1995 se 2008 ke dauraan ve oxford vishvavidhyalay main prafesar the
 Through the book "the Sulfish Gene", published in 1976, he popularized the gene-centered sequence evolution and the "mime" hypothesis
 is kitaab ke anusaar jeev-jantu jin ko zida rakhane kaa ek zariyaa hai
 For example: a mother protects her children so that she can keep her genes alive
 richard dockins ek naastik hai or "bhagwaan ne duniya banaai" mat ke aalochak ke rup main jane jate hai
 In The God Delusion, published in 2006, he stated that it is useless to believe in the existence of a divine world-maker and that religious belief is just an illusion
 janvari 2010 tak is kitaab ke angrezi sanskaran kii 2,000,000 se adhik pratiyaan bechi ja chuki hai or 31 bhashaaon main iske anuwaad kyn ja chuke hai
 In his scientific work in evolutionary biology, Dawkins is best known for the popularity of the gene as a major unit of selection in evolution; This view is most clearly set out in his books: dockins lagaataar vikaas main gaiyr-anukuli prakriyaaon ke bare main uljhan main rahaa he or jin ke "upar" staron par chayan ke bare main he
 They are particularly skeptical about the practical possibility or importance of group selection as a basis for understanding altruism
 yah vyavhaar pehle vikasvaadi virodhabhas ke rup main prakat hota he, kyonki dusron kii madad karne se unhen anmol sansaadhan milte hai or apni fitness kam ho jaati he isse pehle, bahut se logon ne samooh chayan ke ek pahalu ke rup main vyakhya kii thi: vyakti puri tarah se aabaadi yaa prajatiyon ke astitv ke liye jo sabase acha he, vah kar rahe hai
 British evolutionary biologist WD Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his coordinated fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can develop if such altruism has sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients
 hamiltan kii samaveshi tab se fitness ko kai tarah ke jeevon par safaltaapurvak lagu kiya gaya he, jisamen insaan shaamil hai
 Likewise, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of gene-centric models, developed the principle of mutual altruism, whereby one organism benefits another in the expectation of a future reciprocal relationship

 dankins bhi swatantra vaigyanik james luvalock kii gia pariklpana kii dridhtaa se aalochana karte rahe hai
 Critics of Dawkins's biological approach suggest that it is misleading to take genes as a unit of selection; Genes can be better described, they say, as a unit of development
 da swaarthee jin main, dokin bataate hai ki ve jin kii jorge si
 Using Williams's definition of "that which is isolated and reassembled with a passionate frequency
 " ek or aam aapatti he ki ek jin akele nahin batch sakati he, lekin anya ke saath sahyog karnaa chahie ek vyakti kaa nirmaan karne ke liye jin, or isliye ek jin ek swatantra "ikai" nahin ho sakati he
 In the extended phenotype, Dworkin states that from the point of view of an individual gene, all other genes are part of the environment to which it is adapted
 chayan ke ucch str ke liye adhivaktaaon kaa suzav he ki kai ghatnaayen hai jo ki jin-aadhaarit chayan santoshpurvak vyakhya nahin kar sakate
 The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom the Decchis were disguised as the subject of selfish genes, has criticized gene selection, memetics, and sociologists; She suggests that the popularity of Dworkin's work to factors in the Thiecher / Reagan decades of increasing individualism, such as Zeitgeist
 tantra or vikaas kii vyakhya par vivaadon ke ek set main, ek gut ko aksar dokins ke naam se rakhaa jaataa he, jabaki anya gut kaa naam american peleotologist stephen je ke naam par rakhaa gaya he

 a typical example of Dawkins situation is Steven Rose, Leon J
 kemin or richard si
 Levontine is not in our genes
 do anya vichaarak jinhen is vishay par aksar dokin ke saath sambhddha mana jaataa he, steven pinkar or dainiel danet; danet ne vikaas ke jin-kendrit drushtikon ko protsaahit kiya he or jeevigyaan main katautee kaa bachaav kiya he
 In his book The Selfish Gene, Dawkins describes the term meme as a text to encourage how Darwin's theories can be extended beyond the realm of genes

 Forming will be oriented towards maximum loss of internal surface area on the lower floor
 Brick use in high buildings resumed in the 1950s, following the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the Building Research Establishment at Watford UK

a power-operated device for a limited time even when power supply is not available from the main source of supply
 upies kai prakaar ke banaaye jate hai or simit samay ke liye aapurti uplabdh karaane ke alaava ye kuch or bhi kaam kar sakate hai - jaise voltata-niyantran, aavriti-niyantran, shakti gunank vardhan evam uski gunvattta ko behatar karke upkaran ko dena, aadi
 UPS has one means of energy storage, such as a battery, a fast-moving flywheel, a charged capacitor or an excessive current flowing in a superconducting coil
 upies, sahaayak urja-strot jaise- stand-bai janarator aadi se is maamle main bhinn hai ki vidyut jane par ve sambandhit upkaran ko milane vaali vidyut main naganya samay ke liye vyavdhaan karte hai jisase us upkaran ke kaam main baadha yaa rukawat nahin aati
 UPS is often used with computers, data centers, communication devices, etc
 where an accident can occur due to power outages; Fear of destroying important figures; There may be loss of business etc
 upies na sirf computer ko voltage kam-zyada hone kii sthiti main haani se bachaata he, balki vidyut aapurti chale jane kii sthiti main kuch samay baad tak computer ko vidyut pradaan karata he, jisase upayokta apana kiya hua kaam sahej lete hai or computer ko sahi tareeke se shat down kar pate hai
 If the power supply of the computer goes away or becomes unstable, then it is likely to damage the hard drive and RAM and the motherboard can also be in danger
 upies main voltata niyantran bhi avashya hona chaiye, jisase upies is khatre se computer ko bachaa paye
 It should be noted that UPS should not be overloaded with external devices like installing unnecessary printers, scanners and fax machines etc
 kabhi bhi printer ko bydaree back ap system main plag na karen
 Similarly, UPS can be either offline type or line-interactive type
 ofline upies sara lod bydaree par daal detaa he
 The response time to switchover, also known as switching time, is 2 to 10 minutes
 zyaadaatar swimming-mod power supplai kaa hold ap time 16 minute se kam hota he, jo upies ke swimming time se adhik hota he jis kaaran computer shat down kii samasya nahin hogi
 Most of the presently found UPS lines are interactive UPS
 ye ek seemaa tak input asi power ko niyantrit karte hai or bydaree asi power se charge ho jaati he
 Not only this, such upss are of small size and are available with most producers
 online upies upies tulanaatmak rup se mahange hote hai
 In this design, the battery is charged through the inverter
 chunki asi line se sidhaa judaav nahin hota, isse line main koi gadabadi hone kaa asar upies par nahin padataa
 If using computers at home, then comparatively cheap standby power system should be used for this
 upies kai tarah ke hote hai
 According to a classification, they can be static or rotational
 jin upies main koi ghoomane vaali mashin prayog nahin kii jaati balki keval sthavar ardhchaalak yuktiyaan prayog kii jaatin hai use sthitik upies kehete hai
 In contrast, rotary machines that use rotary UPS are called rotary UPS
 the The power capacity of UPS should be high
 adhik upies is tarah dizin kiye jate hai ki vidyut jane ke 10 minute baad tak unase jude upkaran kaam kar sakate hai
 For this, V
A
 Ratings have to be kept in mind
 ampear reating computer / upkaran par likhi hoti he, jise voltage se guna kar sakate hai
 Should take such UPS, whose V
A
 Rating should be 20 to 25 percent higher
 adhiktar pisi ke liye 600 volt-ampear kii dar kaa upies kaaphi rahata he
 Most UPS is taken on the basis of backup time, so that its full capacity is not known
 bydaree byaap puri tarah se is baat par nirbhar karata he ki judane vaala upkaran kitni urja le rahaa he
 The more powerful the device, the more it consumes energy

 purvi tathaa pashchimi samaajon dwaara sampatti kaa prayog saamaajik sanghathan tathaa saamaajik rahan-sahan ke liye ek atyaavashyak vastu ke rup main hota rahaa he

 "sampatti" shabd kaa arth tab nishchit he jab is shabd kaa prayog ek parivaar or uske sadasyon se sambandhit vastuon kaa sambandh vyakt karne ke liye kiya jane laga
 Later, the tendency of the people to acquire and conserve the objects of individuals was recognized by the social conditions and the property began to be supported, seeing the rationale and necessity of its origin
 vah sammaan kii vastu ban gai tathaa uskaa vikaas saamaajik vishistataaonvali sanstha ke rup main hone laga
 In the primitive society, the official scholars of religion gave birth to the law, and in that society both property and family were unqualified words because both had their original religion and both were recognized by religion itself

 "mancipium", "dominium" and "proprietus" are used equally for property or "ownership" in the jurisdiction
 mainsipium kaa arth he abhigrahan, adhikaar main karnaa, visheshkar bhoomi aadi
 The word "manshipium" is almost the same as the word "planet" in Sanskrit
 roman main "dominium" athwa "propierts" kaa arth un sab adhikaron kaa samooh he jisase swaamitv kaa bodh hota he
 Over time, "self" developed and gradually it came to be understood as the independent use of an object and the right to send or give it away
 aadim samaajon main sampatti ke saath dharmik bhaavana bhi judi rahati thi
 Where the land and its production were the main means of livelihood and the method of land acquisition was to be acquired by encroachment and conquest, the right to land and farming was considered as a kind of wealth and thus it was the major part of property belonging to a caste or family

 English law is very much influenced by Roman law
 "sampatti" shabd ke kai arth ho sakate hai yatha swaamitv yaa swatv, arthath swami ko praapt sampurna adhikaar
 Sometimes it means the Roman "race" under which the right of ownership is exercised under which the right of ownership is exercised, ie the object itself which is the subject or character of the said right
 "res" athwa "vastu" kaa maanav se sambadh bataanevaala arth sampatti ke swaroop ke vikaas main sahaayak hua he
 Thus the sense of authority over "race" or "object" and the affirmation of "race" or "object" itself are complex and intimately related to the affinity suffix, ie both are complementary and supportive of each other
 roman main "res" kaa arth atyant jatil he
 It is a solid object of authority like English
 kintu "res" kaa thik thik arth "vastu" ke bilkul samaan nahin he, usase kuch adhik he
 Although the original meaning of "race" is a physical object, it was gradually used to express an asset that could be not only physical and physical but also intangible such as electricity
 "res" kaa prayog vishishtadhikaar ke liye bhi hota he or aise adhikaron ke liye bhi jo, udaahranarth, prasiddhi yaa khyaati se utpann hote hai
 Thus, due to the frequent use of race for these two meanings, "race" has two meanings: "race earth" means material things which can come under the rights of human beings and "race inactive" means those rights themselves
 is prakaar antim vishleshan ke falswaroop "vastu" kaa aashay "res parthiv" se hi liya jayega
 In Roman language "race" is used for both property and possession of property, but the word "sow", which is used for goods or money, is equivalent to the word "wealth" in Sanskrit
 arabi juriyon ke anusaar "maal" shabd sampatti tathaa kisi bhi aisi vastu ke liye prayukt ho saktaa he jiskaa arabi kanoon main mulya yaa arth ho athwa jo kisi vyakti ke adhikaar main rah sakati ho
 The word "money" is also often used for property
 sampatti ke arth main prayukt honevaali vastu main sthayitv kaa tathaa bhautik ekatv kaa gun hona aavashyak he
 a collection of units whose units are themselves separate objects and an object made up of the inclusion of such single units can also be called objects; Such as a house made of brick or bricks or a sheep or a hut made of many sheep
 kanoon main vastu kaa prayog kuch adhikaron evam kartavyon ko vyakt karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Depending on physical properties, an "object" can be of two types - movable or immovable
 lekin agreji kanoon ke takneekee niyamon ke anusaar vastu, vaastavik tathaa vyaktigat hoti he
 According to Roman law, "race" is similarly divided into "mansepebul" and unmanciple
 is prakaar sampatti ek or "res" yaa "vastu" or duusari ore res athwa vastu se sambandhit manushya ke adhikaron se sambhddha he
 Therefore, a person is required for the property, who can hold his authority over something
 antim vishleshan ke anusaar sampatti, ek vyakti or ek vastu yaa adhikaar, jise vah keval apana maanata ho, ke madhya sthapit sambadh ko vyakt karti he
 In its modern experiments property is used for all goods or property which belongs to a person or has been dedicated to another person but reserves the right to arrange that item for their benefit
 res yaa vastu ke parthiv or aparthiv vargeekaran tathaa vastu yaa adhikaron ke swaroop ke anusaar sampatti kaa vargeekaran vibhinn prakaar se hua he jaise, parthiv yaa aparthiv; chal yaa achal tathaa vaastavik yaa vyaktigat
 Joint taxation of property with other specific terms such as personal or public, paternal, liable, joint family, unofficial, etc
 expresses a relationship with the nature of the property
 sampatti kii vaidhanik vyakhya ke anusaar iske kai arth he
 The property also bears the fruits of physical and mental exertion done by a person
 koi bhi vyakti apni kisi vastu ke badale main jo kuch bhi paata he, jo kuch bhi use diya jaataa he or jise kanoon dwaara us vyakti kaa mana jaataa he athwa use prayog karne, bhoga karne tathaa vyavastha karne kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya jaataa he, vah sab us vyakti kii vyaktigat sampatti kehalaati he
 But if it is not recognized by law, it cannot be called property and then there is no relation between the person and the object in terms of legal consequences
