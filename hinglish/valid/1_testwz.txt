 There is an epic composed by Devasia for which he was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1980
 je si kumarappa bharat ke ek arthshaastri the
 His original name was 'joseph Chelladurai Cornelius'
 ve mahatma gandhi ke nikat sahyogi rahe
 He was the pioneer of economic principles related to village development
 unhone gandhivaad par aadhaarit aarthik siddhanton kaa vikaas kiya
 JC Kumarappa is considered the first guru of Gandhian economics in India
 apane jeevankaal main kumarappa ne gandhivaadi arthshaastra se jude vishyon par na keval vishad lekhan kiya balki ek purnakalik kaaryakarta ke rup main bharat ke duurastha sthanon main anek aarthik surveykshan karke gramin arthvyavastha ke kayakalp ke liye sarthak kaaryniti kaa pratipaadan bhi kiya
 Kumarappa's economics was based on the principle of giving economic autonomy and opportunities for all-round development to every person of independent India
 bharat kii gramin arthvyavastha or iske prakritik swaroop ko unnat karne ke himachati kumarappa aise birle arthshaastri the jo paryaavaran sangrakshan ko audyogic-vanijyik unnati se kahin adhik laabhprad maanate the
 Even his own colleagues in the Congress Party did not fully agree with Gandhi's economic philosophy
 isiilie swatantra bharat kii aarthik nitiyon or gandhivaadi aarthik nitiyon ke bich koi samanta nahin rahi
 As a result, independent India soon forgot Kumarappa in the race for the sampling of western economy
 kumarappa kaa janm tamilnadu ke thanjavur shahar main 4 janvari 1892 main ek isai parivaar main hua tha
 The childhood name was Joseph Chelladurai Cornelius
 unka unhone madras se apni schuli shiksha puri karne ke baad landan jaakar lekha-vidhi main prashikshan praapt kiya or phir vahiin landan main accountint ke rup main kuch varshon tak kaam bhi kiya
 He returned to India at the end of the First World War and at the call of his mother and started his business in 1924 after working for a while in a British company in Bombay
 1927 main ve ucch adhyayan ke liye america gayi or syracruz vishvavidhyalay se vaanijya evam vyapaar prabandhan main snaatak kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 He then studied public finance at Columbia University and wrote a research paper on 'public Finance and Poverty of India' under the guidance of the famous economist Edwin Seligman of his time, in which the economic plight of India suffered from the policies of British colonial rule
 Was
 is adhyayan ke dauraan hi kumarappa ne paaya ki bharat kii dayaneey aarthik sthiti kaa mukhya kaaran british aupniveshik shashan kii aniatik or shoshak nitiyaan hai
 Meanwhile, he decided to add his original family name Kumarappa with his name
 swatantraaa andolan se jude logon main bhi angrezon dwaara bharat ke aarthik shoshan ko lekar baicheni thi
 At the center of this uneasiness was the public debt that the British Empire inflicted on it, in the name of governing India, and wanted to overthrow the colonial Indians
 congress ke 1922 ke gaya adhiveshan or iske baad 1929 ke lahore adhiveshan main is vishay par charchaa bhi hui thi
 Meanwhile, after returning to India from America in 1929, Kumarappa visited the Sabarmati Ashram to meet Gandhi in the context of publishing his article on Indian economic exploitation
 gandhi ne apane patr yang india main is lekh ko prakashit karne main ruchi bhi dikhaayi or kumarappa se gujarat ke gramin kshetron main aarthik surveykshan karne kaa aagrah kiya
 At Gandhi's behest, Kumarappa went to survey at Matar Taluka in Kheda district of Gujarat
 gujarat kaa yah ilaaka pichley kai saalon se kam varsha ke kaaran bheeshan jal sankat se guzar rahaa tha lekin iske baavjood rajasav vasuuli ke liye sarkari amala behad sakhti dikhaa rahaa tha
 Kumarappa, through an economic survey of the residents of 45 villages of Matar Taluka, demonstrated for the first time the statistical correlation between the rate of revenue collection and the agro-based economy
 isi dauraan yang india main kumarappa ke lekh ‘saarvajanik vitt or hamaari nirdhantaa’ kaa silsilewar prakaashan bhi shuru ho gaya
 Also, the Economic Survey of Matar Taluka was being published
 in prakashnon ke bich gandhi ne namak satyagrah ke liye dandi yatra bhi shuru kar di
 When the British administration arrested Gandhi for participating in the Salt Satyagraha, the responsibility of operating Young India fell on Kumarappa
 is patr main lekhan ke kaaran kumarappa ko bhi giraftaar karke dedh saal ke liye jail bhej diya gaya
 Kumarappa was released after the gandhi-irwin Pact in 1931 and was made the chairman of the committee set up at the Lahore Congress session to properly examine the financial dealings between the British government and India
 is congress adhiveshan ke baad gandhi golmez sammelan main bhaag lene ke liye england chale gayi
 In Gandhi's absence, Kumarappa again took up the responsibility of editing Young India and due to his aggressive writing, the British government arrested him again and sent him to Zell for two and a half years
 1933 main xel se chhootane ke baad kumarappa ne bihar main vinaashkari bhucamp ke raahat-kaary ke paise ke len-dein kaa kaam dekha
 Like a very honest and devoted volunteer, Kumarappa also refused to pay for his arrival and return to Gandhi, who was part of this relief work
 gandhi ne 1934 main wardha ashram main kumarappa ke netritv main akhil bhartiya gram udyog sangh kii sthapana kii jisamen gramin arthvyavastha ke anukool utpaadon ke nirmaan, sangrakshan evam prasar kaa abhiyaan chalaaya gaya
 Kumarappa was well aware of the contribution of the rural economic condition to the strengthening of the Indian economy and hence he took full time to make this Village Industry Association effective
 akhil bhartiya gram udyog sangh main apane is anubhav ke aadhaar par san 1936 main kumarappa ne 'gram andolan kyon?' sheershak se ek pustak prakashit kii jo gaanvon kii aarthik unnati par kendrit gandhivaadi arthshaastra ke siddhanton ke ghoshnaa patr ke samaan he
 During 1939-40, Kumarappa conducted comprehensive economic surveys in Madhya Pradesh and North West Frontier Province
 1942 main jab british sarkaar dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa adhiktar karch bharat par daalana chaahati thi to kumarappa ne iske virodh main ek lekh ‘stone for bread’ likhaa or jiske prakaashan ke baad unhen ek baar phir xel bhej diya gaya
 Kumarappa, using his zeal stay well, wrote two books titled 'practice and Percepts of Jesus' and 'economy of Parmanance'
 pehali pustak isa messiah kaa anushilan va gyanbodh main isiyat ke sachche aadarshon ke bare main vivechna thi
 The economics of sustainability have been presented in the concept of economic development of human beings along with environmental protection
 is pustak ko kumarappa kii sarvshereshth kriti mana jaataa he
 Kumarappa died on 30 January 1960

 sanganak sanchika ekatrit jaankaree kaa ek varg he, yaa jaankaree ko sanchit karne ke liye ek sansaadhan he jo ki kisi sanganak kaarykram ko uplabdh hota he or aamtaur par yah kisi prakaar kii tikaoo sanganak bhandaaran par aadhaarit hota he
 The file is durable in that it exists for use by other programs even after the current program has finished
 sanganak sanchikaon ko paaramparik rup se daphtaron or pustakaalayon ke filon main maujuud kagaz ke dastavezon kaa aadhunik rup mana ja saktaa he, isiilie angrezi main iskaa naam fil padaa he
 At the lowest level, many modern operating systems consider files to be only a series of one-dimensional bytes
 adhik ucch str par, jab sanchika kii saamagree ko bhi maddenzar rakhaa ja rahaa ho, to ye dwilvie ank purna, akshar, chhavi pixel, dhwani yaa kisi or chiz kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue maane ja sakate hai
 It is up to the program to use the file how it interprets the file and understand the internal settings of the information so that it can present the same information in a more meaningful style to the user
 kisi bhi samay par sanchika kaa ek aakaar hoga, aamtaur par yah biton main abhivyakt kiya jaataa he or yah darshata he ki is sanchika ne bhandar main kitni jagah gheri hui he
 In most modern operating systems this size can be any nonnegative integer, but will have a maximum limit according to the system
 lekin sanchika kii saadhaaran paribhaasha yah lazimi nahin tehraati he ki uske maujuuda aakaar kaa koi vaastavik arth ho, sivaay us maamle main jab sanchika kii saamagree, ek drudh sangrah ke samooh ke andar kii kuch saamagree ho
 For example, in a Unix-like system, the file to which the link to / bin / ls points is defined and rarely changed
 isaki tulana / dev / null se karen to yah bhi ek sanchika he par iskaa aakaar hameshaa badalata rahata he balki shaayad us tarah myne hi nahin rakhata he jaise pichley udhaaharan kaa myne rakhata he
 The information and small information contained in a computer file can be in the form of bundles or can also be movable
 yah maatr sanchika ke rachanaakaar par nirbhar he ki usamen jaankaree kaa aayojan kis prakaar kiya jayega
 For this reason, many low-standard file structures exist that can serve any purpose, from the simplest to the most complex
 adhiktar sanganak sanchikaon kaa istemaal sanganak kaarykram karte hai
 These programs create, change and delete the appropriate files for their use
 jo kaarykram-nirmaataa in kaaryakramon ko banaate hai, vahi faisalaa karte hai ki koun si filon kii zarurat he, unka istemaal kaise hona he or unke naam bhi ve nirdhaarit karte hai
 In some cases, computers manipulate program files in such a way that they are visible to the computer user
 udhaaharan ke liye shabd-sansaadhan carkram main prayokta dastauez sanchikaon main badlaav karte hai or prayokta khud hi unhen naam bhi dete hai
 The contents of the document file are organized in such a way that the word-processing program understands it, but the user determines its name and storage address, and the key information of storage is also determined by the user
 kai anuprayog sabhi saamagree sanchikaon ko ek hi sanchika main ghused dete hai or alag alag prakaar kii jaankaree kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye andar hi nishaan laga ke rakhte hai
 Content files from games like Doom and Quake are an example of this
 sanganak par, sanchikaon ko bananaa, badalanaa, badhanaa, chota karnaa, sthanantarit karnaa or mitaanaa sambhav he
 In most cases, all this is done by running computer programs on the computer, but the user of the computer can also make changes to files if needed
 udhaaharan ke liye, microsoft verde kii sanchikaaye aamtaur par prayokta ke nirdeshon ke aadhaar par microsaft verde kaarykram dwaara banaai jaati hai, lekin prayokta in sanchikaon ko sidhe hi windos explorer jaise kisi sanchika prabandhak kaarykram ke jariye bhi hataa, mitaa yaa sthanantirit kar saktaa he
 In unix-like systems, user-zone processes usually do not directly connect to files; The operating system provides a segregation level that allows almost all transactions with files from the user-area to occur through hard links
 kathor kadiyon ke jariye kisi sanchika kaa naam diya ja saktaa he ; vishuddh rup se prachaalan pranali main sanchikaon ke naam nahin hote hai
 For example, user-area programs cannot delete a file, they can only delete a link to that file, and if the linker finds that the file no longer has any other links, it can delete this file
 Can be erased
 vastav main keval ashthi hi sanchikaon se len-dein karata he, par prayokta-kshetra ke anurodhon kaa sanchikaon ke jariye is tarah hota he ki prayokta-kshetra kaaryakramon ko yah agyaat hi rahata he
 While the transaction of programs with files varies according to the operating system and file system, mainly these activities are common: aadhunik sanganak pranaaliyon main sanchikaon tak pahunchne ke liye aamtaur par filanaamon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In some operating systems, this name is associated with the file
 kuch anya main sanchika swayan benaam hoti he, par namit kadiyaan uski ore ingit karti hai
 In this case, the user can only recognize the link as the file name, but this will not be true, especially when the same file has more than one link
 sanchikaaye nirdeshikaon main ho sakati hai
 But it would be better to say that the directory can contain a list of files or a list of links to files
 is paribhaasha ke antargat yah samajhnaa bahut zaruri he ki "sanchika" shabd main nirdeshikas bhi shaamil hai
 This makes staging of directories possible, ie subdirectories inside directories
 jo naam kisi nirdeshika ke andar kisi sanchika ko sanderbhit karata he, use anokhaa hona zaruri he
 But some operating systems also specify a type with a name, which makes it possible to have two different types of files in a directory with the same name, such as a directory and a file of the same name

 The pillars — especially the Sarnath pillar — have a brightly polished, hourglass, and animal motif in the top, and Western scholars have expressed the view that the art has been inspired by unleavened Iran
 chaowkee par hanson kii ukeri gai akritiyon or anya sajjaaon main unani prabhaav bhi dikhaai detaa he
 According to Indian scholars, the source of the art of Ashoka's pillar is Indian

 But Vasudev Sharan Agarwal has presented evidence from the Mahabharata and the Apastamb Sutra, which proves that the art of producing bright polishes was known in India before Iran

 According to Buddhist practice, Ashoka built 8,400 stupas

 The idols of these yakshi-yakshi have their own personal style, which can be distinguished from a typical look
 atimanviya mahakay murtiyan khule akaash ke neeche sthapit kii jaati thim
 In this regard, the Yaksha Murthy received from the village of Parakham, the Yaksha idol from Patna — with opdar glitter and an article — the Chamaragrahini Yakshi from Didarganj in Patna city — which also has the Mauryan style of glow — and the Yakshi from Besnagar
 Is particularly notable

 'chakravarti samraat' kaa adarsh charitaarth hua
 Kautilya gave realization to the Chakravarti region

 The theory of monarchy is a triumph in the 'mauryan era'
 is yug main gana rajyon kaa hraas hone laga or shashan satta atyadhik kendrit ho gai
 There were some semi-independent states on the border of the empire and inside the empire, such as Kamboj, Bhoja, Pattanik and Aatvik kingdoms
 rajshasan kii vaidhata'maury kaal' main praja kii shakti main atyadhik vruddhi hui
 According to the tradition of traditional theology, the king is the protector of religion, not the exponent of religion
 rajshasan kii vaidhata is baat par nirbhar thi ki vah dharm ke anukool ho
 But Kautilya presented a new paradigm in this direction
 kautilya ke anusaar- 'rajshasan dharm, vyavhaar or charitra se upar tha'
 Thus kingship was given prominence
 is badhati hui prabhusatta ke kaaran hi maury samraat ashok ke samay rajtantr ne paitruk nirankushta kaa rup dhaaran kiya
 Ashoka considered all subjects equal
 unke aihik or parloukik sukh ke liye swany ko uttaradaayi samajhataa tha or praja ko uchit kaary karne kaa upadesh detaa tha
 Since the focal point of governance was the king, it was necessary for the governance of such a large empire that the king was enthusiastic, energetic and always ready for the work of the people
 chandragupta maury evam ashok donon maury samraaton main ye gun prachur maatra main vidyaman the
 Regarding Chandragupta's work readiness, Megasthenes wrote that "the king used to work in the court without disruption"
 kautilya ne kaha he ki- "jab raja darbar main hi baitha ho to use praja se baahar pratiksha nahin karwaani chahie, kyonki jab raja praja ke liye durlabh ho jaataa he or kaam apane maatahat adhikariyon ke bharose chhod detaa he, to vah praja main vidroh kii bhaavana paidaa karata he or raja ke shatruon ke shadyantra kaa shikaar ho jane kii ashanka paidaa ho jaati he
 "in his sixth scripture, Ashoka issued a communiqué that-" He can meet for the work of the praja and at every place and he gets great satisfaction in working for the good of the praja "
 niti nirdharanraja hi rajya kii niti nirdhaarit karata tha or apane adhikariyon ko rajagyaaon dwaara samay-samay par nirdesh diya karata tha
 It is clear from Ashoka's rock and pillar articles that his edicts were issued to the subjects
 chandragupta maury ke samay main guptcharon ke madhyam se duurastha pradeshon main shashan kar rahe adhikariyon par samraat kaa puraa niyantran rahata tha
 During Ashoka, tourists used to take the help of Mahamatras, Rajukas, Territorials, men and other officials
 sanchaar vyavastha ke sanchaalan ke liye sadaken thim, samrik mahatva kii jagahon par sena kii tukadiyaan tainaat rahaa karti thim

 The highest officials of the state were called ministers
 inaki sankhya teen yaa chaar hoti thi
 They were selected from the Amatya class
 'amaatya' shashan tantra ke ucch adhikariyon kaa varg tha
 The chief minister and priest were selected by the king after thorough examination of his character
 is kriya ko 'upadha pareekshan' kaha gaya he 
 These ministers were members of the intimate cabinet in a way
 rajya ke sabhi kaaryon par is antarang mantrimandal main vichaar-vimarsh hota tha or unke nirnay ke pashchaat hi karyarambh hota tha
 Apart from the Cabinet of Ministers, there was another Council of Ministers

 The king acted according to the decision of the majority
 jahaan tak mantriyon tathaa mantriparishad ke adhikaar kaa sawaal he, unka mukhya kaary raja ko paraamarsh dena tha
 They controlled the autocracy of the king, but the influence of ministers greatly depended on their merit and tenacity
 ashok ke chathe shilaalekh se anumaan lagata he ki parishad rajya kii nitiyon athwa rajagyaaon par vichaar-vimarsh karti thi or yadi aavashyak samajhati thi to unamem sanshodhan kaa suzav bhi detii thi
 It was in the king's interest to benefit in consultation with the minister or members of the council
 kintu kisi niti yaa kaary ke vishay main antim nirnay raja ke hi haath main hota tha
 The burden of governance was mainly on a large section of the people, who governed from different parts of the empire
 'arthshaastra' main sabase unche str ke karmchaariyon ko 'tirth' kaha gaya he
 Eighteen such pilgrimages are mentioned, some of whom were important officials - ministers, priests, senapati, crown prince, collector, sannidhata and ministerial ministers
 tirth shabd ek-do sthanon par prayukt hua he
 In most places, they are labeled as 'mahamatra' or 'mahamatya'
 sabase mahatvapurn tirth yaa mahamaatr mantri or purohit the
 The king used to appoint other ministers and Amatya in consultation with him
 rajya ke sabhi adhikranon par mantri or purohit kaa niyantran rahata tha
 The commander was the head of the army
 jyeshtha putr yuvaraj pad par vidhivat abhishikt hota tha
 He was appointed to a responsible position to teach in government work 
 bindusaar ke kaal main ashok malwa pradesh kaa prashaasak tha or use vidrohon ko dabaane yaa vijayabhiyaan ke liye bheja jaataa tha
 Collecting revenue revenue, keeping details of income expenditure and preparing annual budget were the functions of the collector
 dehati kshetra kii shashan vyavastha bhi usee ke adheen thi
 From the point of view of governance, the country was divided into small units and government work was carried out with the help of officials
 inhen adhikariyon kii sahaayta se vah janaganana, gaanvon kii krishi yogya bhoomi, logon ke vyavsaay, aay vyay, tathaa prayek parivaar se milane vaale kar kii maatra kii jaankaree rakhata tha
 This information was necessary to prepare an annual income expenditure budget
 guptcharon ke dwaara vah deshi va videshi logon kii gatividhiyon kii puri jaankaree rakhata tha
 Which was a very important responsibility for security
 pradeshtri athwa pradeshikon, sthanikon or gop kii sahaayta se vah chori, daqaiti karne vaale aparaadhiyon ko dandit karata tha
 Thus, the Collector in a way fulfilled the duties of the modern finance minister and home minister
 sannidhatra ek prakaar se koshadhyaksh tha
 His job was to build treasuries and treasuries in different regions of the empire and to protect the revenue received in the form of cash and grain

 aisa kaha jaataa he jab atri muni yahaan se kuch hi duuri par tapasya kar rahe the to unki patni anasuia ne pativrat dharm kaa paalan karte hue is sthaan par apana nivas banaaya tha
 Kavindati says that when the glory of Goddess Anasuiya began to be sung in all the three worlds, Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati forced Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh to test Anusuiya's husbandry religion
 puranic katha ke anusaar tab ye tridev devi anasuia kii pariksha lene sadhuvesh main unke ashram pahunchein or unhone bhojan kii ichha prakat kii
 But she kept a watch in front of Anusuiya that she would sit on his lap and feed him naked with a hug

 When he remembered his husband with closed eyes, he saw Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh standing as sadhus standing in front

 On the other hand, the three women became unhappy at the disconnection of husbands

 On the strength of his perseverance, Anasuiya brought the three gods back to the east

 In the temple's womb lies the magnificent stone statue of Anasuya, on which is placed a silver umbrella

 aakhirkaar 20 navambar 1910 ko astapava naamak ek chote se railway stesan par is dhanik putr ne ek garib, niraashrith, biimaar vruddh ke rup main maut kaa aalingan kar liya
 Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy was born in Yasnaya Polyana, a princely state about 100 miles south of Moscow

 After coming to the princely state, he made efforts to improve the condition of his peasants and conveniently presented certain conditions for them to become independent landlords, but the Assamese class was influenced by rumors of imminent independence, so they rejected the terms of Tolstoy

 yaheen par unki pratham rachana childehud 1852 main nirmit hui jo el0 tii0 ke naam se "ti contemporeri" naamak patr main prakashit hui
 Even in that romantic era, the creation of this monotonously realistic manner attracted people and there was a lot of speculation about the name of its creator at that time
 1854 main tollstoy danyube ke morche par bheje gaye; vahaan se apni badali unhone sebastopol main kara lee jo krimian yuddh kaa sabase tagada morcha tha
 Here he got ample opportunity to examine the war and the operators of the war closely

 This resulted in his creation "sebastopol Sketches"

 In 1855, he traveled to Petersburg where he was respected by the literary writers
 1857 ore 1860-61 main inhone pashchimi europe ke vibhinn deshon kaa paryaton kiya
 The main purpose of the latter tourism was to get information about the composition and activities of the objective educators and charitable institutions
 isi yatra main unhe yakshma se peedit apane bade bhai kii mrityu dekhne ko mili
 The death of Yakshmakrantha Bhai, the interminable torture, had a miraculous effect on Tolstoy
 yuddh or shanti, aanna karenina or evan ilich kii mrityu main mrityu ke jo atyant maarmik chithran milte hai, unka aadhaar uparyukt ghatana hi rahi he
 After returning from the yatra, he opened a school in his village Yasnaya Polyana for the children of farmers

 In this, the present test system and the system of passing failed on its basis was not kept

 On behalf of the school, a magazine called "yasnaya Polyana" was also released in the name of the village, in which Tolstoy's articles published expresses very pithy views on various problems of the school and its students

 Its revolutionary ideas are such that due to which it was not allowed to publish in Russia and the book was published in Switzerland
 is samay kii unki anya kai rachanaayen isi koti kii hai or ve sab switsraland main chhapi hai
 In the period from 1878 to 1885, Tolstoy remained inactive in terms of creating literary literature
 unki antarvruti maanav jivan ke rahasy kii khoj main uljhi rahi
 All of Ambakat's compositions began to seem futile to him
 par 1886 main ve pun: ucchkoti ke siddhhast upanyaas lekhak ke rup main saamne aae or isi varsh unki mahaan upanyasik rachana '"evan ilich kii mrityu"' prakashit hui
 The whole world had become enlightened by their ethos of faith and the recognition of Yasnaya Polyana Village had become famous as an excellent pilgrimage center

 It was during these days that he read Tolstoy's compositions and was attracted to them
 19veen shatabdi kaa ant hote hote daridron or asaaayon ke prati tollstoy kii sevavruti yahan tak badi ki unhone apni rachanaaon se rus desh main honevaali apnin samast aay daan kar di
 He allowed his wife to take only the amount that was necessary for the whole family's nutrition
 'punarutthan' naamak apane upanyaas kii samast aay unhone rus kii shantivaadee jati dukhebor logon ko rus kaa parityag kar canada main ja basane ke liye de di
 Suddenly in 1910, he decided to abandon his ancestral village "yasnaya Polyana" forever
 10 navambar 1910 ko apni putree eleclandra ke saath unhonen prasthaan kiya, par 22 navbanr 1910 ko maarg ke stesan astapovo main aksmaat fefde main dah hone se vahiin unka sharirant ho gaya
 His religion was very liberal and comprehensive
 tatkaaleen isai dharm ke prati unki spashtat: virdohi bhaavana thi
 From his thoughts he seems to be a kind of omnipotentist
 mrityu ko ve sharir kii antim ore avashyambhavi parinti maanate the
 He considered man as the ultimate and inevitable culmination of the body
 manushya ke sampark main aanevaali prayek vastu ko upyogita ke maandand se aankana ve uchit samajhate the or isi kaaran jivan kii soddeshyata ke prati ve sarvada jigyaasu bane rahe
 They considered a purposeless, thoughtless and autistic life as a kind of sin; Even he considered sexual intercourse only for the purpose of procreation
 manovaigyanik rachanaaon main fyodor dostoyevski hi tolastay ke samakaksh thaharte hai
 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi
 But now, for example in the last decade, such a thing could not happen, because from the ninth decade of the last century to the end of the century, historical development has moved very far
 atah aaj jab uparokt ghatnaon ne 'purvi' gatiheenata kaa ant kar diya he, aaj, jab 'vekhi'-panthiyon ke sachetan rup se pratikriyaavaadi, sankeern-vargeey tathaa swaarthee-vargeey arthon main pratikriyaavaadi vichaar udaaravaadi burjua logon main itane vyapak rup se fail gayi hai, aaj, jab in vichaaron kii chhot kuch dikhaau marxvaadiyon ko bhi lag gayi he, jiskaa parinaam 'visarjanwaadee' pravriti he, to tolastoy ke siddhanton ko adarsh bataane, unke 'apratirodh' unki 'aatma' kii duhaayiyon, 'atmoddhar' ke liye unke aahvaan, 'antahkaran' or vishwa 'prem' ke siddhant, tapasyavaad or quaitism ke unke upadesh, aadi-aadi ko uchit tehraane yaa un par lipapoti karne kii har koshish pratyakshtam or gahanatam haani hi karti he

 God is the one who forgets the work that we do from people as well, because of this, Pashupati is the result of all actions
 is darshan main mukti do prakaar kii kahi gai he : ek to sab duhkhon kii atyant nivritti, duusari parmaishwarya prapti
 Other philosophers have called the utmost retirement of grief as 'moksha', but the Pashupat philosophy says that only the retirement of grief is not liberation, what is there only with attrition until it also achieves ecstasy? Liberation of the divine is the attainment of two types of powers - visual power and action power
 druk shakti dwaara sab vastuon or vishyon kaa gyaan ho jaataa he, chaahe ve sookshm se sookshm, dur se dur, vyavahit se vyavahit hon
 In this way, after attaining omniscience, action power is proved by which whatever is desired, it is done immediately

 Perfection of both these powers is liberation of God
