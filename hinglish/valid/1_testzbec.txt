 shriimatii = glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa = with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii = great, city; dasha cha dve = ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani = yojana-s; aayataa = lengthy; triini vistiirnaa = three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 Neither commentaries were written in the medieval dictionary of Hindi nor did the etymology of the words be followed

 Today the giant collision hypothesis is widely accepted by the scientific community
 sah-abhivruddhi siddhant kahata he, prithvi or chandramaa kaa nirmaan saath-saath hua he
 This theory failed because it could not explain why the Moon lacks an iron core
 yadi donon kaa nirmaan saath-saath hua hota to unki sanrachanaae bhi samaan honi chahie thi
 According to another hypothesis, the moon was formed in a place in the solar system where iron content was small and was then acquired in orbit around the Earth
 jab chandramaa kii chattaanon ne prithvi kii tarah hi samaan isotope sanrachanaon ko dikhaaya tab adhigrahan kaa yah siddhant bhi munh ke bal gir gaya
 Another hypothesis is based on the fragmentation theory, according to which a nuclear fission about 2900 kilometers below the Earth's surface resulted in the dust and crust of the Earth flying into space and this debris gathered and gave birth to the moon
 haalanki yah siddhant vivaadit he
 a new research has emerged about the origin of the Moon

, are printed on cheap paper
 samachar patr sanchaar ke sadhano main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhte hai
 Newspapers are usually daily, but some newspapers are weekly, fortnightly, monthly and even half-yearly
 adhiktar samachaarpatr sthaneey bhashaaon main or sthaneey vishyon par kendrit hote hai
 The earliest known newspaper was 59 BC
 Is 'the Roman Acta Diurna'
 julies sisar ne janasadhran ko mahatvapurn rajnatijna or samaajik ghatnaon se avgat karaane ke liye unhe shahro ke pramukh sthano par preshit kiya
 Handwritten newspapers were introduced in China in the 8th century
 akhbaar kaa itihaas or yogadan: yun to british shashan ke ek purv adhikari ke dwaara akhabaaron kii shuruyaat maani jaati he, lekin uskaa swaroop akhabaaron kii tarah nahin tha
 It was only a one-page informational paper
 purnroopen akhbaar bengal se 'bengal-gajet' ke naam se vysarai hikki dwaara nikaala gaya tha
 Initially, the British used newspapers for their own benefit, as all newspapers were coming out in English, so news and information could not reach the majority of people
 jo khabaren baahar nikalakar aati thintra se guzarate, vahaan apana aatank failaate rahete the
 There were neither cases nor any punishment against them
 in naarkeey paristhitiyon ko jhelte hue bhi log khamosh the
 During this period, newspapers such as 'the Hindustan Times', 'national Herald', 'pioneer', 'mumbai-mirror' in India used to come out in English, in which there was no mention of those atrocities
 in angreji patron ke atirikt bangala, urdu aadi main patron kaa prakaashan to hota rahaa, lekin uskaa dayera simit tha
 Only a Bengali reader or a person who knew Urdu could understand it
 aise main pehali baar 30 may 1826 ko hindi kaa pratham patr ‘udant martand’ kaa pehla ank prakashit hua
 This letter was weekly
 ‘udant-martand' kii shuruyaat ne bhashaayi str par logon ko ek sutara main baandhane kaa prayaas kiya
 It was not just a letter, but the tongue of thousands of people who were still silent and frightened
 hindi main patron kii shuruyaat se desh main ek krantikari parivartan hua or aazaadee kii jang
 They were twisted and presented so that the news of the atrocities of the British Government would be suppressed
 angrej sipaahi kisi bhi kshetra main ghuskar manamaana vyavhaar karte the
 Incidents like robbery, murder, rape were common
 wo jis bhi ksheko bhi ek nai disha mili
 Now people started getting information about the events happening in the corner of the country
 lekin kuch hi samay baad is patr ke sampadak jugal kishor ko sahaayta ke abhaav main 11 disambar 1827 ko patr band karnaa padaa
 On 10 May 1829, the Hindi newspaper Bangdoot was published from Bengal
 yah patr bhi logon kii aawaaj bana or unhen jode rakhane kaa madhyam
 After this, in July 1854, Shyamsunder Sen published the 'samachar Sudha Varshana' from Calcutta
 us dauraan jin bhi akhabaaron ne angreji hukumat ke khilaaf koi bhi khabar yaa aalekh chapa, use uski keemat chukaani padi
 Newspapers were banned
 uski pratiyaan jalawaai jaati thim, uske prakashkon, sampadakon, lekhakon ko dand diya jaataa tha
 He was fined heavily so that he could not muster the courage to rise again
 aazaadee kii lahar jis tarah puure desh main fail rahi thi, akhbaar bhi atyaacharon ko sahakar or mukhar ho rahe the
 This was the reason that after partition of Bengal, the voice of Hindi letters became more elevated
 lokmaanya tilak ne 'kesari' kaa sampadan kiya or lala lajpat raay ne punjab se 'vande maataram' patr nikaala
 These letters called for greater cooperation in the freedom struggle of the youth
 in patron ne aazaadee paane kaa ek jajba paidaa kar diya
 'kesari' was removed from Nagpur by Madhavrao Sapre, but the letter was banned due to Tilak's provocative articles
 uttar bharat main aazaadee kii jang main jaan phunkane ke liye ganesh shankar vidhyaarthee ne 1913 main kanpur se saptahik patr 'pratap' kaa prakaashan aarambh kiya
 It used to publish information about atrocities in every part of the country
 isse logon main aakrosh bhadakne laga tha or ve british hukumat ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye or bhi utsahit ho uthe the
 In view of its aggression, the British administration gave various harassment to its writers and editors, but this paper remained on its target
 isi prakaar bengal, bihar, maharashtra ke kshetron se patron kaa prakaashan hota rahaa
 Those letters tried to spread the urge for people to gain freedom and spread awareness
 agar yah kaha jaae ki swatantraaa senaniyon ke liye ye akhbaar kisi hathiyaar se kamatar nahin the, to koi atishyokti nahin hogi
 The freedom weapon of the newspaper became as independent and outspoken as the press is today, it was bound by restrictions and restrictions in the freedom struggle
 na to usamen manoranjan kaa put tha or na hi ye kisi kii kamai kaa jariya hi
 These newspapers and magazines were a weapon and medium of freedom fighters, which kept them connected to people and events
 aazaadee kii ladaai kaa koi bhi aisa yoddha nahin tha, jisane akhabaaron ke jariye apni baat kehane kaa prayaas na kiya ho
 Gandhiji also published newspapers in the name of 'harijan', 'young-india', while Maulana Abul Kalam Azad published 'al-hilal'
 aise or kitne hi udhaaharan hai, jo yah sabit karte hai ki patr-patrikaon kii aazaadee kii ladaai main mahati bhoomika thi
 This was a period when people had no means of communication
 us par bhi angrejon ke atyaacharon ke shikaar asahaay log chupchaap saare atyachar sehate the
 Neither one was going to listen to them nor to defeat their sorrows
 wo kehete bhi to kisase or kaise? har koi to usee pratadna ko jhel rahe the
 In such a situation, the introduction of magazines and magazines gave courage to the people, and encouraged them
 yahi kaaran tha ki krantikariyon ke ek-ek lekh janata main nai sphurti or deshbhakti kaa sanchaar karte the
 When Bharatendu's play 'bharat-plight' was published, people got to experience how the people of India are going through and what is the intention of the British
 nabhikeey astr yaa parmaanu bam ek visphotak yukti he jisaki vidhvansak shakti kaa aadhaar nabhikeey abhikriya hoti he
 It can be made by nuclear fusion or nuclear fission or by the combination of both these types of nuclear reactions
 dono hi prakaar kii abhikriya ke parinamswaroop thode hi saamagree se baari maatra main urja utpann hoti he
 Today's nuclear weapon, slightly larger than one thousand kilos, can generate as much energy as it can generate from conventional explosives of several billion kilos
 nabhikeey hathiyaar mahavinashkari hathiyaar kahe jate hai
 The most powerful explosive used in World War II was the name 'blockbuster'
 iske nirmaan main tab tak gyaat prabalatam visphotak trinitrotoluin kaa 11 ton prayukt hua tha
 The first atomic bomb, which was 2000 times more powerful than this explosive, was detonated by T
N
 T
 was equivalent to an explosion of 22,000 tons
 ab to pratham parmaanu bam se bahut adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam bane hai
 The detonating substance in a nuclear bomb is uranium or plutonium
 uranium yaa plutonium ke parmaanu vikhandan se hi shakti praapt hoti he
 For this, neutrons are struck in the nucleus of the atom
 is prahaar se hi bahut badi maatra main urja praapt hoti he
 This process is called physicist nuclear fission
 parmaanu ke nabhik ke abhyantar main jo neutron hote hai unheen se neutron mukt hote hai
 These neutrons strike other atoms and cause fragmentation again
 ye phir anya parmaanuon kaa vikhandan karte hai
 This is how chain actions begin
 parmaanu bam kii aniyantrit shrunkhlaa kriyaaon ke falswaroop bheeshan prachandta ke saath parmaanu kaa visphot hota he
 Many isotopes of uranium are known
 saamaanya uranium main 99
3 pratishat you-238 or 0
7 pratishat you-235 rahete hai
 The fragmentation of U-238 is not as easy as the fragmentation of U-235
 you-235 main you-238 kii apeksha teen neutron kam rahete hai
 It is due to this lack of neutrons that fragmentation of U-235 occurs easily
 anya vikhandaneey padaarth jo parmaanu bam main kaam aate hai ve you-233 or plutonium-239 hai
 a nuclear explosion requires critical codes of fissile material
 shrunkhlaa kriya ke chaalu karne ke liye kranthik sanhati nunatam maatra he
 If the amount of fissile material is less than the critical code, then the neutron will only continue to crumble
 maatra ke dhire dhire badhaane se ek samay aisi avasthaa aegi jab kam se kam ek unmukt neutron ek nae parmaanu par prahaar kar uskaa vikhandan kar degaa
 On reaching such a state, the fragmentation process starts running automatically
 kranthik sanhati kii maatra gopneey he
 Only those nations that make nuclear bombs know and do not tell others
 yadi you-235 kii kranthik sanhati 20 pound he to das das pound do jagah lene se shrunkhlaa kriya chaalu nahin hogi
 Taking 20 pounds together will start the chain operation
 shrunkhlaakriya main neutron kii sankhya badi shighrata se badhati he
 Fission in a nuclear bomb raises the heat of uranium and other substances adjacent to it very quickly
 dhatvik uranium badi unchi daab or taap par tapadipt gas main parinat ho jaataa he
 The temperature of the explosive body is 10,00,00,000 ° C
 Wakes up to itane unche taap par uranium kii thapi hat jaati he
 Then the whole body explodes with great intensity
 parmaanu bam ke visphutit hone par aadhaat tarangen utpann hoti hai jo dhwani kii gati se bhi adhik gati se chaaron ore failati he
 When the atomic bomb is detonated above the earth, the waves hit the earth and rise up and create a new shock that spreads up and down intensely
 bam sphot kaa centre tatkaal tapt hokar nirvaat utpann karata he
 The surrounding cold air rushes to fill the vacuum
 is prakaar parmaanu bam se gharon par aghat padane se ve tut jate hai
 Explosive uranium turns into other elements, radioactive rays emanate from it and destroy living cells and destroy them
 bam kaa vinashikari kaary aghat tarangon, vedhi kirnon tathaa atyadhik ooshmaa utpaadan ke kaaran hota he
 Hydrogen bombs are a variety of nuclear bombs
 hydrogen bam yaa ech-bam adhik shaktishaalee parmaanu bam hota he
 It requires isotopic du terium and tritium of hydrogen
 parmaanuon ke sanlayan karne se bam kaa visphot hota he
 For this fusion, the temperature is very high, about 500,00,000 ° C
 Is required
 yah taap surya ke ooshnatam bhaag ke taap se bahut unchaa he
 Atomic bombs can achieve such high temperature

 unhen ambe mata kaa rup mana jaataa he
 King Surdasji Surana's dynasty expanded and as time passed Satidasji Surana became the fourth generation of King Surdasji
 sati das ji surana samvath 1210 main nagaur aakar bas gayi the
 Shri Satidas Surana was an ardent devotee of Ambe Mata
 seth satidas kii manokamana thi ki devi unke ghar main putree ke rup main janm le
 Mata Ambe Devi fulfilled her wishes and took birth in the form of daughter Ashwin Shukla Dwitiya of Samvat 1219 in Nagaur
 inhone apni putree kaa naam susawaani rakhaa
 
 samvath 1229 main das varsh kii aayu main unka vivaah sambandh duggad parivaar main karnaa tay hua
 
 us samaaroh main soobedaar bhi aamantrit tha
 Suswani ji when wept
 tab vahaan ke musalmaan soobedaar ne unke rup lavanya par mugdh hokar swayan unase vivaah karne kii thaan lee
 Seth Satidasji was called and proposed to him
 sethji is baat ko sunakar bahut dukhi hue or kaha, “musalmaan or hindu ke bich yah vivaah sambandh kaise ho saktaa he?”kintu soobedaar apni jid par tha
 Failing to obey, he threatened to crush the whole family in the crusher
 seth sati das ji kirag-rag main hindutv kaa khun bharaa tha unhone dridhtaa se soobedaar kaa prastaav thukraa diya
 Then what? The Subedar immediately sent him to jail
 idhar jab unkepariwaar waalon ko is baat kaa pataa laga to sabhi susawaani ji ko kosne lage
 Then they became unhappy and started to remember Lord Arihant God
 prarthana karte vakt unhen neend aa gai
 In his dream, a stunning idol gave him a parable that said: - ""ghabaraane kii baat nahin he
 This is not his place
 
 You will call that wicked one
 shart rakhi he tere aage
 
 saat paanvade kii chhot dekar
 Chase the horse up
 
 He will not be able to catch you
 daud-daud kar thak jaayegaa
 
 swapn kaa haal kahaan maate se
 The forehead saffron was adorned with tilak
 
 Give message to Subedar
 kuch naa ghatane kaa andeshaa
 
 "" The idol disappeared after saying so much
 susawaani ji uthi or unhone apane swapn kaa sab haal apni mata ji se kaha or uske pramaan swarup sab ke mastak par kesar ke tilak dekhe gayi
 Everyone got patience and a message was sent to the Subedar immediately
 soobedaar sunakar prasann hua or turant sweekruti de di
 Preparations started with enthusiasm on both sides
 sethji ko mukt kar diya gaya
 Very soon, after taking a lot of punishment, some soldiers came to Sethji's building with some soldiers
 daudane se purv unhone apane ghar ke daravaaje par kunkum bhare haath kaa chapa lagaaya
 Even today it is marked as stone
 satya katha kaa wo dyotak he
 With seven legs left, Suswani started running ahead and the Subedar along with his soldiers sat on a horse and followed them
 prastaavit kaarykram ke anusaar susawaani paidal daudane lagi or soobedaar ashv par saat kadam peeche
 The race started with the first ray of sunrise
 donon milon daudte rahe parantu faasla yathaavat rahaa
 When Suswani ji is tired of running, she has prayed! Protect me, i can't run anymore adhishthatri devi ne prarthana suni tabhi saamne se ek singh aata hua dikhaai padaa devi ne akashwani main unhen singh par savaar hokar aage badhane ko kaha
 According to knowledge, Suswani immediately rode on the lion and the lion started running
 chalate-chalate vartmaan bikaner ke antargat shri sindhu morkhana gaanv ke najadik pahunch gai
 There was a very ancient temple of Lord Shivshankar Bholenath
 Here too Suswani prayed to Bholenath, "lord, protect me
 mujhe chhipane kaa sthaan do
 "bhole Shiva appeared and threw his tongs towards the front of the temple and said -" o Goddess, you go straight to where the tong has fallen, where is your place
 "bholenath kaa phenkaa hua chimata ek ker ke ped ke bich main padaa tha
 As soon as Suswani reached there, both the earth and the tree exploded with words
 susawaani ji singh ke sahit usamen samaa gai or jameen phir jyon kii tyon ho gai
 Four fingers of Sujvani's rag were left out
 soobedaar or uske saathi us palle ko lekar hi jhagadne lage
 Everyone wanted to marry her
 baat bad gayi,talavaarein khinch gai or ve vahaan aapas main ladakar samaapt ho gayi
 Whose goddesses still exist in Morkhana

 Father was terrified after hearing this

 The Subedar was stubborn
 
 For not obeying
 dhamkee de di garaj-garaj kar
 
 kolhu main pisva daaloongaa
 i will kill everyone by number
 
 Seth Satidas was a Hindu candidate
 nas-nas main hindutv bharaa tha
 Strongly turned down the offer
 soobedaar ne jail bhijwaya
 
 ghar waalon ko pataa chalaa jab| susawaani ji ko kosa tab
 
 man hi man jab dukhi hui mata
 The unhappy mind only cares for the Lord
 
 Thank you to Nan Mund Arihant

 The forehead saffron was adorned with tilak
 
 Give message to Subedar

 donon taraf hi khushiyaan chai
 He gave release to Seth
 
 Suswani ji was standing ready
 ye to pariksha kii hi ghadi thi
 
 daud se pehle dwaar pe ai
 Kunkum's hand raided
 
 It is as it is in stone
 satya katha kaa wo dyotak he
 
 sasavani ji jab thak ke haari
 Calling mother to protect 
 Then there was loud air
 sher pe baith gai susawaani
 
 daud ke morkhana jab pahaunchi
 Shiva was inside the temple
 
 Bid protect Tripurari
 main ablaa hum sharan tihaari
 
 bhole ne phir haath ghumaya
 Maya was seen throwing tongs
 
 Suswani would have reached there
 prithvi vriksh attahas kar fatate
 
 susawaani ji prithvi main samaai
 The ground trembled all around
 
 Those goddesses are still there today
 susawaani mata bhi vahiin he
 
 ker kaa ped bhi vahiin khadaa he
 It is still green after years

 Mandan Mishra, founder of Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth
 mandan mishra, purv mimasaa darshan ke bade prasiddh acharya the
 These are considered proof after Kumaril Bhatt
 advait vedant darshan main bhi inke mat kaa aadar he
 He was a contemporary of Kumaril in the late times after Bhartrihari and a contemporary of Adi Shankara
 mimasaa or vedant donon darshanon par inhone moulik granth likhe
 Mimansanukramanika, Bhavana Vivek and Vivek Vivek - these three texts on epistemology; Sphotasiddhi on the word philosophy, Vivek on proofs and Brahmasiddhi on Advaita Vedanta - these are his texts
 shalikanath tathaa jayant bhatta ne vedant kaa khandan karte samay mandan kaa hi ullekh kiya
 The famous lecturer of Shankar Bhashya, Vachaspati Mishra, the creator of Bhamati, wrote his work keeping in mind the Brahmasiddhi of Mandana
 mandan mishra va shankaracharya kaa shastrarth sthal, mandaleshwar narmada nadi par sthit pavitra nagari he 
 chappan dev mandir, shastrarth sthal pracheen he evam jagadguru aadi shankaracharya kaa parakaaya pravesh sthal gupteshwar mahadev mandir bade romantic sthaan he 
 jiske kaaran mandaleshwar atyant prasikad he ll According to a tradition, Mandan was a disciple of Kumaril Bhatt
 yahi baad main shankaracharya dwaara shastrarth main parajeet hokar sanyasi ho gaye or unka naam sureshwarachaarya padaa
 There is a big dispute about whether Mandan and Sureshwar are the same or different
 adhikansh pramaan donon kii bhinnata ke paksh main hi milte hai
 Mandan has supported Shabdvaita, but Sureshwar is silent about it
 mandan ne advaitaprasthaan main anyathaakhyatvaad kaa bahut had tak samarthan kiya, par sureshwar iskaa khandan karte hai
 According to Mandan, the living being is the shelter of avidya, Sureshwar considers Brahm to be the shelter and poison of avidya
 isi matbhed ke aadhaar par advait vedant ke do prasthaan chal pade
 Bhamati became a follower of Departure Mandan, the description followed the principles of Departure Sureshwar
 sureshwar shuddhgyan ko moksh kaa maarg maanate hai par mandan ke anusaar vedant ke shravanamaatr se moksh nahin miltaa, jab tak agnihotra aadi karm gyaan ke sahakaari na ho yahi nahin, kisi pracheen pramanik granth main mandan or sureshwar ko ek nahin mana gaya he
 There is no irrefutable evidence that Mandan Mishra was a disciple of Kumaril Bhatt
 yah baat keval 'shankar-digvijay' ke aadhaar par kahi jaati he, jo ki ek nitant apramanik katha-pustak he
 When most evidence is found about the difference between Mandan and Sureshwar, it is in no way fair to say that Mandan was the only one who became Sureshwar after being defeated in the debate
 darasal in donon mahapurushon ke bich shastrarth hone kii baat hi puri tarah kaalpanik or ranneetik he, jo madhyakaal main shankar ke math dwaara prachaarit kiya gaya
 Whatever Sureshwar's views about Shabdvaita, otherwise factualism, avidya, jiva, brahma etc
 are following the 100 percent Shankaracharya
 guru ke charnon kii priti hi unka param lakshya he
 He opposes Mandan to the extent of intolerance and calls him the Advaitavedanti of a separate departure
 phir, vahi sureshwar swayan mandan kaise ho sakate hai?'vivaran-prasthaan' ke pravartak sureshwar nahin, 'vivaran-car' hai, jabaki 'bhaamati-prasthaan'puri tarah mandan kaa anugaman karata he
 When Mandan and Sureshwar have not been considered as one in any ancient book, then why are our scholars and teachers troubled with the burden of the myth of scripture from time to time
 ab bhi to sach ko sweekaar kiya jaae
