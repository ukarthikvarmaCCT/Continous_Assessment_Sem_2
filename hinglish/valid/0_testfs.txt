 mahasagariya yatraaon main vaashp ke enginon se keval paalon ke sahaayak ke rup main kaam liya jaataa tha
 The main reason for this was that steam-powered ships had higher fuel costs
 vaashp engine se daandon kaa kaam karanevaale, takhte lage hue chakra ghumaae jate the or jahaaj vaise hi chalata tha jaisaa aaj bhi nadiyon ke anek stimaron main hota he
 In 1838, the first four steam vessels to sail to the United States crossed the Andamasagar Sea, and from 1840, four steamers weighing about 1,150 tons each carried postage between England and North America

 In sailing vessels, the risk of damage is high

 Particularly useful in the use of steamers is that the time of their arrival at the designated place can be described almost exactly

 Therefore, companies with liners became larger business entities respectively

 jaisaa ki yah sabhi jaanate hai ki bharat 15 agast 1947 ko angrejon kii gulaami se aaazaad hua
 Everyone understands that we became independent the same day
 lekin yah ek bahut bada bhram tha
 Mahatma Gandhi had demanded complete independence from the British without any condition
 lekin bharat ke hi kuch swaarthee logon ne angrejon kii raashtra virdohi sharton ko sashart sweekaar kar liya tha, jisamen ek bhashaa niti bhi thi
 The British knew that this country could progress even further on the strength of its language
 isi ko rokane ke liye angrejon ne kuch angreji priy bharatiyon ke saath milakar bhartiya shiksha paddati main sanskrit ko sthaan na dene jaise raashtra virdohi sharten bhi shaamil kii
 Now the question arises as to why such a situation arose? The problem is serious, it is also very researchable
 isaki shuruuaat bhi aazaadee ke pehle se hoti he
 The poisonous seeds of an Englishman named Macaulay are now flourishing
 darasal, angrejon ne bharat kii saamaajik or aarthik sthiti kaa surveykshan karne ke baad, jo shiksha niti bharat ko gulam banaaye rakhane ke liye banaayi thi, vahi niti swatantraaa ke baad bhi kuch logon dwaara jari rakhi gai, jiskaa parinaam hai ki aaj hamaari shiksha vyavastha rojgaar kii guarantee nahin detii
 Even after being educated, there is no guarantee of morality and the situation gets worse when the educated educated people feel sad about all these situations
 unamem na bhartiya samskruti ke prati aadar he or na hi unhen isaki parvaah he
 Highly educated modern generations do not have a sense of pride about Indian history, because in their curriculum we have served the same, which results in them being frustrated and oppressed rather than considering themselves as the best Indian Feel

 They do not even know the names of Indian scientists
 unke liye bharat to keval jameen kaa tukda maatr he
 Why should this happen? On the go, the British lost their minds and gave us education of discrimination and ignorance

 aise kai saare udhaaharan hai, jo keval bhram ke kaaran paidaa kiye gayi he
 Now the question arises that how to get rid of all this? a simple solution is to give due respect to language in the education policy

 In the race of science, we have forgotten that nature also has its own science, which was known by our sages / sages

 The need for such changes in the education system is felt to remove the damage that has been done to the social and economy of India as well as the education system of the country due to the arrival of the British and their excessive interference in the Indian social system
 a new education policy is being initiated
 150 varshon kii gulaami or uske baad apanaai gai shiksha vyavastha ke hi yah sab parinaam he
 We are witnessing the arrival of the British who came from the sense of plunder and the effect of seed-planting of the spirit of schism and on-going mentality

 hamaari puri shiksha vyavastha pehle angrejiyat kaa paath padhaati he or baad main ham unhe hindi kaa paath padhaate he
 An easy solution to this is that the education system has a system that can solve all the problems

 ab to kuch sthanon par santoshi mata ke mandir bhi banane lage hai
 There is one such temple in Jalalabad
 vah ban gayi vidhayak 2013 main
 He supports the ideology of the Congress party
 vah shaadishuda hai Childbirth means giving birth or giving birth to a child
 garbhavastha ke nirdhaarit kaal puraa hone par bachche kaa janm bina kisi avrodh ke hi hona saadhaaran or saral janm kehalaata he
 After observing the child's birth carefully, it is realized that we can divide the method of childbirth into three parts
 pratham bhaag main bachchedani kaa munh khulanaa or failana, duusare bhaag main bachche main sir kaa dikhaai padana or teesraa bhaag jisamen auval baahar aata he
 First part The first phase of childbirth is about 10 to 12 hours or more
 pratham charan kaa samay is baat par nirbhar karata he ki mahila kaa koun sa baccha he
 This phase takes longer in the first child
 duusare bachche main kam tathaa tisare bachche main or kam samay lagata he
 In the first stage, the walls of the vagina are thinned, spread, stretched, and gently moved by the baby's head
 yoni kaa failaa or khinchaa hua bhaag dhire-dhire bachchedani ke munh ko aage aane main madad karata he
 With this phase, a greasy material also comes out which is similar to a membrane called show
 kabhi-kabhi sukuchan je saath-saath emniotic sac fat jaataa he tathaa emniotic drav nikalne lagata he
 Second part: In the second stage of childbirth, the pressure of the uterus occurs after every two minutes and lasts for half or one minute
 is dabaav ke kaaran baccha dhire-dhire neeche dhakela jaataa he
 The child's head can be seen at this stage
 iske baad yoni dhire-dhire simatate hue paraton ke rup main ek parat duusare ke upar chadhati rahati he
 Generally, the head of the child is upwards and his torso is downwards
 kabhi-kabhi dard ke saath bachche ko nikaalane ke liye pet se bhi bachche ko halke haathon se dabaaya jaataa he
 In this stage, long breath exercise is beneficial for the woman
 kyonki saans ko rokkar hi mahila kaa jor lagaana padataa he
 Sometimes tools are also used to get children out
 bachche kaa janm hote samay jab baccha baahar aata he maa ko aisa mahasoos hota he ki jaise ki unke sharir se mel baahar aa rahaa ho
 At the time of delivery, the baby's head comes out first
 phir ek kandhaa, doosraa kandhaa tathaa baad main puraa dhad baahar nikal aata he is prakaar ke bachche ke janm lete hi doosraa charan puraa ho jaataa he
 After the child is born, the baby's mouth and nose are first cleaned
 Sometimes a machine is used to clean the smooth substance and other liquids from the baby's mouth and respiratory tract
 iske baad bachche ko acchhee tarah se saaf kapade main lapet lete hai jisase bachche ke sharir kaa taapmaana bana rahe
 Cleaning of baby's eyes after birth is also necessary
 bachche ke janm lene ke baad bachche ke saans lene kii kaaryakshmata, dil kii dhadkan, twachaa kaa rang, haath pairon kaa hilanaa va chune par bachche kaa swabhaav dekha jaataa he
 This is called apgar
 yadi bachche kii kaaryakshmata saamaanya hoti he to bachche ke haath-pair, kaan, mel-mutradwar tathaa bachche kii peeth ko dekhne ke baad bachche ke pet kii safai aadi kii jaati he tathaa bhojan kii nalika ke avrodh ko dekha jaataa he
 The third stage of the birth of a child is the third stage of the arrival of the Oval after the birth of the child
 bachche ke janm hone ke baad baccha ek naad se judaa hota he jisko naad kehete hai
 It is white, beige and rope-like in shape
 iske bachche kii dhadkan mahasoos kii ja sakati he
 It carries enough amount of blood and oxygen to the child
 duusari taraf yah naad ovel se judaa rahata he jo maa ke bachchedani kii diwaar se chipka rahata he jab baccha thik taraf se rone lagata he or uskaa rang gulabi rang kaa ho jaae to iskaa arth yah hota he ki bachche kaa dil or fefde kaary karne lage hai isi avasthaa main naad ko bachche kii naabhi se lagbhag 8 se 10 semi kii duuri par clamp lagaakar kaata jaataa he
 Cut the pulse and see that it does not touch the ground or anything else because it catches the disease soon and it can cause disease to the child
 isiilie ise kaatane ke baad bachche ke pet par daal dena hi uchit hota he bachche kii kati naad par koi dawa bhi lagaai ja sakati he
 The severed pulse of the child dries slowly within 24 hours
 lagbhag 7 se 10 din main yah sookhkar sharir se alag ho jaati he tathaa iske sthaan par ek batan ke aakaar kaa daag sharir par rah jaataa he jisko naabhi kehete hai
 As long as it remains on the body it is necessary to maintain it
 ise pratidin din main do baar doctori rooyee se spirit ke sahaayta se saaf karnaa tathaa keetanunashak dawa kaa upyog karnaa chahie
 After tearing of the amniotic membrane, this pulse exits several times before the baby is born
 yah avasthaa yah avgat karaati he ki baccha apane samay ke anusaar chota, shaareerik trutiyaan, garbh main bachche kii asaamanya avasthaa yaa garbhashay main emniotic drav kaa adhik maatra hona pramukh kaaran hota he
 After coming out of the pulse from the vulva, blood flow starts to decrease in the pulse, due to the constant pressure on the pulse between the head pressure of the baby and the bones of the mother's hip, sometimes blood circulation stops completely
 is avasthaa main bachche kaa taapmaana va rakt kam hone ke kaaran baccha garbh main hi mar jaataa he
 For this reason, it is beneficial to prompt delivery in this stage or to perform delivery by operation
 kai baar naad kii is prakaar kii avasthaa prarambh main maaloom nahin ho paati he
 To know this condition, one has to examine by clot
 is dasha main prasav sheeghra nahin ho paata he tathaa bachche ke dil kii dhadakanen kam hone lagati he
 For this reason it is necessary that as soon as the amniotic membrane bursts
 us samay stri kii jaanch bhang dwaara sheeghra honi chahie
 In such women, in which the head of the child does not rest on the hip, there is a greater chance of the pulse coming out and after some time it dries itself and falls and the mark of the navel of the child remains for life
 bachche ke janm ke samay jaise hi bachche kaa sir baahar aata he to is baat ko dhyaan dena chahie ki bachche ke chehre par chiknayeeyukt drav kitna laga he kyonki yahi chiknayeeyukt drav bachche ko saans lene main kathinaayee daal saktaa he
 For this reason, the face, nose and mouth of the child should be cleaned thoroughly with a piece of clean cloth
 bachche ke paidaa hote hi bachche ko ulta latakaaya ja saktaa he
 Due to which the smooth fluid that has gone to the lungs, comes back to the mouth and the liquid of the mouth cannot get into the lungs
 is kaaran isko sacshan dwaara saavdhaanee se nikaala ja saktaa he
 a small amount of lubricated fluid may pass into the lungs
 parantu adhik maatra main drav fefdo main jane se bachche kaa ronaa thik nahin hota he
 In such a situation, a tube has to be removed in the lungs and the child has to start medicines
 pehle bachche ke fefde gubaare kii bhaanti bina hawa ke hote hai
 But the lungs are filled with air as soon as they breathe
 usamen se rakt aane lagata he tathaa oxygenyukt rakt fefde se bachche ke hriday kii ore pahunch jaataa he
 In this state, the child's heart starts functioning soon
 isi bich bachche kaa sambandh auval se alag ho jaataa he
 With some pain in the uterus, the oval also slowly starts to leave the grip of the walls of the uterus and gradually, the entire oval comes out and comes out of this gate
 kabhi-kabhi auval ko aane main 10 minute se lekar aadhe ghante kaa samay lag saktaa he aisi sthiti main maa ke pet kii halki maalish bhi kerani pad sakati he
 If the oval does not come out even after this, it is called Retained Oval
 auval ke baahar aate hi auval ko acchhee prakaar se dekhnaa chahie
 If not a single piece of oval can come, then the uterus does not shrink from the entire side and bleeding continues
 bachche ke janm lete hi baccha kuch nile rang kaa ho jaataa he
 But due to crying, oxygen and blood starts circulating in the baby's body
 iske kaaran bachche kaa rang gulabi ho jaataa he
 The child's body is covered with white chicken
 is chiknayeeyukt padaarth ko varanix kehete hai
 Wiping the baby with a clean cloth or bathing the baby brings out this greasy fluid out of the body
 bachche ke chehre par kuch sujan, ankhon kaa dhansa rahanaa or bachche kaa sir kaa kuch bhaag uthaa-sa dikhaai padataa he jisko caput kaha jaataa he
 It all goes well over time
 bachche ke paidaa hote samay sir par jo mansapeshiyon kaa jor lagata he
 He becomes capitulated by it
 parantu yah kuch hi dinon main thik ho jaataa he
 At the time of childbirth, the baby's chest is slightly enlarged
 prasav main yadi ladki hoti he
 So the skin of the labia on either side of his ureter is slightly brown and swollen and some part appears to be coming out
 kabhi-kabhi thodaa sa rakt bhi aa jaataa he isi prakaar ladke main andakoshon kaa bada hona yaa kuch halke nile ba bhure rang kaa dikhaai padana aadi saamaanya baaten hoti he jo samay ke anusaar badal jaati he
 At the time of pregnancy, the woman should decide whether to have the delivery done at home or in the hospital
 garbhavastha ke dauraan mahila kii kisi stri rog se visheshgy se karwaani chahie

 It is true that till date many poems have been written with a voice on the Bhagavad Gita
 apane katipay gunon ke kaaran unke nirmaataa apane-apane sthanon par shreshth hi hai tathapit dopho raatho datto rande ke samuchit shabdon main yah kahana hi hoga ki vidvatta, kavita or sadhuta in teen drushtiyon se gita kii sabhi tikaaon main 'gyaneshwari' kaa sthaan sarvshereshth he
 Dnyaneshwar has written his commentary based on the Gita Bhasha of Shankaracharya
 gyandev ke swayan nath sampradaay main dikshit hane ke kaaran unke is granth main ukt sampradaay ke yatra-tatra sanket milte hai
 With the coordination of knowledge and devotion described in the gita-bhashya, Yoga, Swanubhav, etc
 of the Nath sect have been included in the discussion of Gyan Dev
 inhone in mul siddhanton ko bhagwat sampradaay kii sudrudh peethika par pratishthit kiya he
 Dnyaneshwari is the devotional scripture
 ishwar-prapti kaa ekmev saadhan bhakthi hi he, yah iskaa mahasidhant he
 The devotion of Jnanadev was worshiped, not by an external form of fasting and Niyamadi, but by namasramandi, as an interchange of means
 nathpanth kaa yogamarg jan saadhaaran ke liye sahaj saadhy na hone ke kaaran gyaneshwar ne use bhakthi kaa adhishthan dekar ishwarbhakti rupi netron se yukt kar diya
 The philosophy of Indian philosophy has to give importance to the vibranism propounded by Gyan Dev
 gyaneshwari main sphuranroop se athwa bijrup se vyakt honevaala sphurtwad gyaneshwar dwaara unke amritanubhav naamak ek chote granth main vishad rup se pratipaadit he
 In the seventh chapter of this book, Gyanadev has given the principle of 'the name of the world is Chidvilas' with pure logic
 gyaneshwari ke alankaarpaksh kaa avlokan karne par kavi ke pratibhasampann hriday ke darshan hote hai
 It seems as if they are speaking through simile and metaphor
 unki is rachana main malopama or sanrupak muktahast se bikhere gaye hai
 The specialty is that all these similes and metaphors have been identified with gitatika
 mayanadi, gurupuja, purush, prakruti, chitsoorya aadi unke marathi sahitya main hi nahin apitu vishwavanmay main alokik maane ja sakate hai
 These are the metaphors in which the streams of poetry and philosophy have merged

 coke koyale se taiyaar kiya janevaala thos eendhan
 It is derived from a low-ash, less sulfurized, bituminous coal borne distillation
 sab prakaar ke koyale coke ke liye upyukt nahin hote
 The coal that gets soft by heating and then turns into a more solid mass is called coke coal
 jo koyala garam karne se chur chur ho jaay athwa durbalata se chipka hua jiskaa pind bane, vah koyala coke ke liye anupyukt samajha jaataa he
 The formation of good coke depends on the coal cells, the amount of sulfur and ash present in it, the temperature of the furnace and other conditions
 kabhi kabhi vibhinn kism ke koyalon ke milakar garam karne se acha coke banataa he
 The amount of different ingredients in coal that makes good coke should be as follows: jal 4 pratishat se adhik na ho; The ash content should not exceed nine percent of the dry coal load; coke vibhinn uddeshyon se banaaya jaataa he
 Some coke is made for the manufacture of metals, some for the manufacture of gases and some for burning
 pehle do kism ke cocaon ko kathor coke or tisare kism ke coke ko ardh coke yaa mridu coke kehete he
 Hard coke is somewhat heavy and dense
 vah jald aag nahin pakadta
 Its behavior is not for domestic fuels
 yah pradhanta dhaatuon or gaison ke nirmaan main kaam aata he
 Half coke or soft coke is relatively light and cool and catches fire quickly
 kachche koyale kii apeksha yah dhuaan bhi kam detaa he
 For this reason, it is more suitable for domestic fuels
 coke banane ke liye koyale ko bade-bade paatro main athwa bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke chulhon yaa bhatthiyon main rakhkar vibhinn tapon par garam karte he
 Thus the heating of coal is called carbonization of coal
 ise koyale kaa bhanjan aswan bhi kehete he
 If the temperature of carbonization is 100 C, 1,300 Sense then it is high temperature carbonization, if the temperature is 700 to 900 C, it is intermediate carbonization and if the temperature is below 550 C, there is no separation of coal
 ucchataap carbonikaran se kathor coke or madhyataap tathaa nimnataap carbonikaran se ardh coke yaa mridu coke praapt hota he
 The practice of coke making is more than 300 years old
 pracheen reeti main koyale ke bade bade tukdon ko dher main rakhkar usee prakaar garam karte the jaise lakdi kaa koyala banane main lakdi ke dher ko karte hai
 There was a hole in the middle of the pile of coal, which served as a chimney
 dher ko koyale ke chur se dhak dete the or neeche parshv se usamen aag lagaakar jalaate the
 The burning of some coal caused heat, causing the remaining coal to heat up and form coke
 is prakaar coke banane main lagbhag 10 din kaa samay lagata tha
 When coke was created, the coke was quenched with water and obtained coke
 isamen kuch koyala jalakar nasht ho jaataa tha
 In the middle of the 18th century, the work of making coke in the stoves made of brick began
 aise chulhon kaa aakaar madhumakhi ke chhate sa tha
 From this, the stove got the name Bee Chhata Chulha
 yahi naam aaj tak prachlit he
 At the back, such advanced types of stoves were made, whose coal was heated by placing 2 to 3 feet thick coal
 aise chulhon se coke banane main praaia: 72 ghante lagate the
 In this manner too, some coal was burnt and coke was also produced in small quantities and all the byproducts of carbonization were destroyed
 unako praapt karne kaa koi prabandh nahin tha
 Nowadays, there are stoves in which coal is heated from outside and all the byproducts are saved from destruction

 Now, in fireplaces or chawls made of fire-co-bricks, 1,400 cm
 By the time the heat mixes easily

 There is a tap in it, which removes the volatile fraction
 bhabhake kii kai panktiyaan or panktiyon kii anek shreniyan hoti he
 The Bhabha product is heated with gas
 carboni karan puraa ho jane par garam coke ko nikaalkar pani se bujhaate hai
 Carbonization of coal also occurs in vertical fires or chamber stoves
 chulhaa ytaakar hota he
 And once it can be carbonized five tons of coal
 kaksh silica kaa bana hota he
 It is also heated by the produced gas
 koyala upar se daalaa jaataa he or coke pende se nikalataa he
 Carbonization takes about 12 hours to complete
 yah bhabhaka saviram kism kaa hota he
 The vertical bhabha are also of continuous type
 ye ytaakar athwa andakaar hote hai
 In these, 10 tons of coal can be carbonized at one time
 upar se koyala girtaa or pende tak aate aate coke main parinat ho jaataa he
 The coke is extinguished by steam in the cooling chamber
 bhabhaka utpaadak gas se garam hota he
 The joint remains so that the work of making coke continues without cease
 coke ban jane par use bujhane kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This is called quenching of coke
 yah kaam iton ke bane shamanyan main hota he
 The steam that is formed when extinguished comes out from the top
 jalatank se pani aakar coke par girtaa he
 Generally, the temperature of coke is 1,000 C
 prati ton coke ke bujhane kii prakriya main jo bhaap banati he usamen das lakh british-ooshmak-matraa ooshmaa nasht hoti he
 There have been attempts to recover this heat
 ek aise praytn main shamanyan se coke ko band kaksh main le jate hai
 Close the door of that room and enter air in it
 phir use byler kii nalee main lejaakar shamanyan main baar baar le jate hai
 Oxygen of air is converted into carbon dioxide and carbonmonoxide
 vaayu kii nishkiy gaisen batch jaati he
 Such air is carried in the vehicle until its temperature drops to 250 C
 Doesn't even happen
 aise coke main jal kii maatra kam rahati he
 Therefore, this coke is good for aeration
 aisa shushk shamansanyantr baitaane main kharch kuch adhik padataa he
 Coke making plants belong to several companies
 un sabaki apni apni visheshtaayen hai
 The following things are noted in the coke making plant
 1
 coke achche kism kaa or ek sa bane
 2
 Coke manufacturing took least fuel
 3

 4
 The plant should be easily repaired if required
 5

 Coke made in different bhabhas or stoves is not of the same nature
 yah koyale kii prakruti, carbonic ran ke dhang or carbonikaran ke taap par nirbhar karti he

 oelex kii visheshtaon main shaamil hai: Rajya Sabha is the upper house of Indian democracy
 loksabhaa nichali pratinidhi sabha he
 The Rajya Sabha consists of 245 members
 jiname 12 sadsy bharat ke raashtrapati ke dwaara namankit hote hai
 These are called 'nominated members'
 anya sadasyon kaa chunaav hota he
 Members are elected in the Rajya Sabha for 6 years, in which one-third of the members are retired every 2 years
 kisi bhi sangheey shashan main sangheey vidhayika kaa upree bhaag sanvaidhanik baadhyataa ke chalate rajya hiton kii sangheey str par raksha karne vaala banaaya jaataa he
 The Rajya Sabha has been formed due to this principle
 isi kaaran rajya sabha ko sadanon kii samanta ke rup main dekha jaataa he jiskaa gathan hi sansad ke dwitiya sadan ke rup main hua he
 The Rajya Sabha has been constituted as a review house to review the proposals passed by the Lok Sabha
 yah mantriparishad main visheshgyon kii kami bhi puri kar sakati he kyonki kam se kam 12 visheshgy to is main manonith hote hi hai
 All proposals for imposition of emergency which go before the President must also be passed by the Rajya Sabha
 july 2018 se, rajyasabha saansad sadan main 22 bhartiya bhashaaon main bhaashan kar sakate hai kyonki upree sadan main sabhi 22 bhartiya bhashaaon main ek saath vyakhya kii suvidha he
 The Vice President of India is the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha kaa pehla satr 13 may 1952 ko hua tha
 Rajya Sabha is a name that was announced on 23 August 1954 in the House by the Chair
 isaki apni khaas visheshtaayen hai
 The Second House in India began with the 1918 montague-chelmsford Report
 bharat sarkaar adhinium, 1919 main tatkaaleen vidhanmandal ke dwitiya sadan ke taur par council of stats kaa srijan karne kaa upbandh kiya gaya jiskaa visheshadhikaar simit tha or jo vastut: 1921 main astitv main aayaa
 The governor-general was the ex-officio Chairman of the then Council of States
 bharat sarkaar adhinium, 1935 ke madhyam se iske gathan main shaayad hi koi parivartan kiye gaye
 The Constituent Assembly, which first met on 9 December 1946, also served as the Central Legislature until 1950, then it was converted into a 'provisional Parliament'
 is avadhi ke dauraan, kendriya vidhanmandal jise 'samvidhan sabha' or aage chalakar 'anantim sansad' kaha gaya, 1952 main pehle chunaav karaae jane tak, ek-sadani rahaa
 There was a wide debate in the Constituent Assembly regarding the usefulness or non-use of the Second House in independent India and ultimately the decision to create a bicameral legislature for independent India was mainly because the federal system was made for such a large country with immense diversities
 Considered the most comfortable form of government
 vastut:, ek pratyaksh rup se nirvaachit ekal sabha ko swatantra bharat ke samaksh aane vaali chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye aparyaapt samajha gaya
 Hence, a second house known as the 'council of States' was created whose structure and electoral system was completely different from the directly elected Lok Sabha
 ise ek aisa anya sadan samajha gaya, jisaki sadsy sankhya lok sabha se kam he
 It was meant to be a confederate house, ie an assembly which was elected by the elected members of the states and the assemblies of the two union territories in which the states were not given equal representation
 nirvaachit sadasyon ke alaava, raashtrapati dwaara sabha ke liye baarah sadasyon ke namanirdesan kaa bhi upbandh kiya gaya
 The minimum age for its membership was fixed at thirty years while for the lower house it is twenty five years
 council of stats kii sabha main garima or pratishtha ke avyav sanyojit kiye gaye
 This was done by making the Vice President of India the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its meetings
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 80 main rajya sabha ke sadasyon kii adhiktam sankhya 250 nirdhaarit kii gai he, jinamein se 12 sadsy raashtrapati dwaara namanirdeshit kiye jate hai or 238 sadsy rajyon ke or sangh rajya kshetron ke pratinidhi hote hai
 However, the current strength of Rajya Sabha is 245, out of which 233 are representatives of the Member States and the Union Territory of Delhi and Puducherry and 12 are nominated by the President
 raashtrapati dwaara namanirdeshit kiye jane vaale sadsy aise vyakti honge jinhen sahitya, vigyaan, kala or samaaj seva jaise vishyon ke sambandh main vishesh gyaan yaa vyaavhaarik anubhav he
 The Fourth Schedule to the Constitution provides for allocation of seats to the States and Union Territories in the Rajya Sabha
 sthanon kaa aavanton prayek rajya kii jansankhya ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 As a result of the reorganization of states and the formation of new states, the number of elected seats in the Rajya Sabha allotted to the States and Union Territories has been changing from time to time since 1952
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 84 main sansad kii sadsyta ke liye arhataaen nirdhaarit kii gai hai
 To qualify for membership of Rajya Sabha, a person must have the following qualifications: use bharat kaa naagarik hona chahie or nirvachan ayog dwaara is nimitt praadhikrut kisi vyakti ke samaksh teesri anusuchee main is prayojan ke liye die gaye praroop ke anusaar shapath lenaa chahie yaa pratigyaan karnaa chahie or us par apane hastakshar karne chahie; He must be at least thirty years of age; uske paas aisi anya arhataaen honi chahie jo sansad dwaara banaai gai kisi vidhi dwaara yaa uske adheen is nimitt vihit kii jaaen
 Disqualification samvidhan ke anuchhed 102 main yah nirdhaarit kiya gaya he ki koi vyakti sansad ke kisi sadan kaa sadsy chune jane ke liye or sadsy hone ke liye nirarhit hoga- If he holds an office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State, except in a post which the holder of which is not disqualified, declared by law by Parliament; yadi vah vikrutchit he or sakasham nyaayalay kii aisi ghoshnaa vidyaman he; If he is undischarged bankrupt; yadi vah bharat kaa naagarik nahin he yaa usne kisi videshi rajya kii naagarikta swechha se arjeet kar lee he yaa vah kisi videshi rajya ke prati nishtha yaa anushakti ko abhisvikaar kiye hue hai; If he is thus disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament
 spashtikaran-is khand ke prayojanon ke liye, koi vyakti keval is kaaran bharat sarkaar ke yaa kisi rajya kii sarkaar ke adheen laabh kaa pad dhaaran karne vaala nahin samajha jayega ki vah sangh kaa yaa aise rajya kaa mantri he
 In addition, the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution provides for disqualification of members on the basis of change of party
 dasvin anusuchee ke upbandhon ke anusaar, koi sadsy ek sadsy ke rup main us dasha main nirarhit hoga, yadi vah swechha se apane raajnneetik dal kii sadsyta chhod detaa he; yaa vah aise raajnneetik dal dwaara, jiskaa vah sadsy he, die gaye kisi nidesh ke viruddh sadan main matdaan karata he yaa matdaan karne se virat rahata he or aise matdaan yaa matdaan karne se virat rahane ko us raajnneetik dal dwaara pandraa din ke bheetar maaf nahin kiya gaya he
 a member elected as an independent candidate will be disqualified if he joins any political party after his election
 tathaapi, raashtrapati dwaara sadan ke kisi namanirdeshit sadsy ko kisi raajnneetik dal main sammilit hone kii anumati hogi yadi vah sadan main apana sthaan grahan karne ke pehle chah maas ke bheetar aisa karata / karti he
 a member will not be disqualified on this basis if he / she voluntarily relinquishes membership of his / her political party after being elected Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 rajya sabha main rajyon or sangh rajya kshetron ke pratinidhiyon kaa nirvachan apratyaksh nirvachan paddati dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The representatives of each state and two union territories are elected according to the proportional representation system by a single transferable vote by the elected members of the legislative assembly of that state and the members of the electoral college of that union territory, as the case may be
 dilli rashtriya rajdhani kshetra ke nirvaachak mandal main dilli vidhaan sabha ke nirvaachit sadsy or puducheri sangh rajya kshetra ke nirvaachak mandal main puducheri vidhaan sabha ke nirvaachit sadsy shaamil hai
 The Rajya Sabha is a permanent house and does not dissolve
 tathaapi, prayek do varsh baad rajya sabha ke ek-tihaai sadsy seva-nivrutt ho jate hai
 a member elected for a full-time term serves for a term of six years
 kisi sadsy ke kaarykaal kii samaapti par sevanivritti ko chhodkar anyathaa utpann hui rikti ko bharne ke liye karaayaa gaya nirvachan 'up-chunaav' kehalaata he
 a member elected in a by-election may remain a member for the remainder of the term of the member who had resigned or died or who was disqualified to be a member of the House under the Tenth Schedule
 rajya sabha ke peethasin adhikariyon kii yah jimmedaari hoti he ki ve sabha kii kaarywahi kaa sanchaalan karen
 The Vice President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 rajya sabha ke sadasyon ke vipareet rajyasabha ke sabhapati kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon kaa hi hota he, rajya sabha apane sadasyon main se ek upasabhapati kaa bhi chayan karti he
 The Rajya Sabha also consists of a panel of Deputy Speaker, whose members are nominated by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha
 sabhapati or upasabhapati kii anupasthiti main, upsabhadhyakshon ke panel se ek sadsy sabha kii kaarywahi kaa sabhapatitv karata he
 Unlike the Lok Sabha, the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha gives his resignation not to the Deputy Chairman but to the President
 mahasachiv kii niyukti rajya sabha ke sabhapati dwaara kii jaati he or unka rank sangh ke sarvocch civil sevak ke samatuly hota he
 The secretary-general works anonymously and is readily available to the Presiding Officers for advice on parliamentary matters
 mahasachiv rajya sabha sachivalay ke prashasnic pramukh or sabha ke abhilekhon ke sangrakshak bhi hai
 He works under the direction and control of the Chairman, Rajya Sabha
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 75 ke adheen, mantri parishad samuhik rup se lok sabha ke prati jimmedaar hoti he jiskaa aashay yah he ki rajya sabha sarkaar ko bana yaa gira nahin sakati he
 However, it can control the government and this task becomes especially important when the government does not get majority in Rajya Sabha
 kisi saamaanya vidhaan kii dasha main, donon sabhaaon ke bich gatirodh dur karne ke liye, samvidhan main donon sabhaaon kii sanyukt baithak bulaane kaa upbandh he
 In fact, there have been three such occasions in the past when Parliament meetings were held jointly to resolve differences between them
 sanyukt baithak main uthaaye jane vaale muddon kaa nirnay donon sabhaaon main upasthit or mat dene vaale sadasyon kii kul sankhya ke bahumat se kiya jaataa he
 The joint meeting is held in the Central Hall of Parliament House which is presided over by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha
 tathaapi, dhan vidheyak kii dasha main, samvidhan main donon sabhaaon kii sanyukt baithak bulaane kaa koi upbandh nahin he, kyonki lok sabha ko vittiya maamalon main rajya sabha kii tulana main pramukhataa hasil he
 In relation to the Constitution Amendment Bill, the Constitution provides that such a Bill has to be passed by both the Houses by a specific majority, as prescribed under Article 368 of the Constitution
 at:, samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke sambandh main donon sabhaaon ke bich gatirodh ko dur karne kaa koi upbandh nahin he
 Ministers can be from any House of Parliament
 is sambandh main samvidhan sabhaaon ke bich koi bhed nahin karata he
 Every minister has the right to speak in any assembly and to participate in its proceedings, but he is entitled to vote in the same assembly of which he is a member
 isi prakaar, sansad kii sabhaaon, unke sadasyon or unki samitiyon kii shaktiyon, visheshadhikaron or unmuktiyon ke sambandh main, donon sabhaaon ko samvidhan dwaara bilkul samaan dharaatal par rakhaa gaya he
 Other important matters in respect of which the two Houses have similar powers are: - Election and impeachment of the President, Election of vice-president, approval of Proclamation of Emergency, Proclamation related to failure of constitutional machinery in States and Financial Emergency
 vibhinn sanvaidhanik praadhikaranon aadi se prativedan tathaa patr praapt karne ke sambandh main, donon sabhaaon ko samaan shaktiyaan praapt hai
 Thus, it is clear that the two Houses have equal powers except in the case of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers and certain financial matters which fall under the jurisdiction of the Lok Sabha only
 ek parisangheey sadan hone ke naate rajya sabha ko samvidhan ke adheen kuch vishesh shaktiyaan praapt hai
 The Rajya Sabha has three special powers
 vidhaan se sambandhit sabhi vishyon / kshetron ko teen soochiyon main vibhajit kiya gaya he- sangh suchi, rajya suchi or samavarti suchi
 Union and state lists are mutually excluded - no one can legislate on a subject placed in the territory of another
 tathaapi, yadi rajya sabha upasthit or mat dene vaale sadasyon main se kam se kam do-tihaai sadasyon ke bahumat dwaara yah kehete hue ek sankalp paarit karti he ki yah "rashtriya hit main aavashyak yaa samichin" he ki sansad, rajya suchi main pramanit kisi vishay par vidhi banaae, to sansad bharat ke sampurna rajya-kshetra yaa uske kisi bhaag ke liye us sankalp main vinirdisht vishay par vidhi banane hetu adhikaar-sampann ho jaati he
 Such a resolution will be in force for a period of one year but this period can be extended again for one year by passing a similar resolution
 yadi rajya sabha upasthit or mat dene vaale sadasyon main se kam se kam do-tihaai sadasyon ke bahumat dwaara yah ghoshit karte hue ek sankalp paarit karti he ki sangh or rajyon ke liye sammilit ek yaa adhik akhil bhartiya sevaaon kaa srijan kiya janaa rashtriya hit main aavashyak yaa samichin he, to sansad vidhi dwaara aisi sevaaon kaa srijan karne ke liye adhikaar-sampann ho jaati he
 Under the Constitution, the President has the right to issue proclamations in the event of national emergency, in the event of failure of constitutional machinery in a state or in case of financial emergency
 aisi prayek udghoshnaa ko sansad kii donon sabhaaon dwaara niyat avadhi ke bheetar anumodith kiya janaa anivaary he
 However, the Rajya Sabha has special powers in this regard under certain circumstances
 yadi koi udghoshnaa us samay kii jaati he jab lok sabha kaa vighatan ho gaya he athwa lok sabha kaa vighatan iske anumodan ke liye anugnaat avadhi ke bheetar ho jaataa he or yadi ise anumodith karne vaala sankalp rajya sabha dwaara anuchhed 352, 356 or 360 ke adheen samvidhan main vinirdisht avadhi ke bheetar paarit kar diya jaataa he, tab vah udghoshnaa prabhavi rahegi
 Money Bill can be introduced only in Lok Sabha
 iske us sabha dwaara paarit kiye jane ke uparant ise rajya sabha ko uski sahmati athwa sifarish ke liye pareshit kiya jaataa he
 The power of Rajya Sabha in respect of such a bill is limited
 rajya sabha ko aise vidheyak kii prapti se chaudaa din ke bheetar use lok sabha ko lautaanaa padataa he
 If it is not returned to the Lok Sabha within that period, the Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by both the Houses in the form in which it was passed by the Lok Sabha at the end of the said period
 rajya sabha dhan vidheyak main sanshodhan bhi nahin kar sakati; yah keval sanshodhano kii sifarish kar sakati he or lok sabha, rajya sabha kii sabhi yaa kinhin siforeeshon ko sweekaar athwa asweekaar kar sakegi
 Apart from Money Bills, certain other categories of Finance Bills also cannot be introduced in Rajya Sabha
 tathaapi, kuch anya prakaar ke vitt vidheyak hai jinke sambandh main rajya sabha kii shaktiyon par koi nirbandhan nahin he
 These Bills can be introduced in any House and the Rajya Sabha has the right to reject or amend such Finance Bills like any other Bill
 vastut: aise vidheyak sansad kii kisi bhi sabha dwaara tab tak paarit nahin kiye ja sakate, jab tak raashtrapati ne us par vichaar karne ke liye us sabha se sifarish nahin kii ho
 However, all these things do not lead to the conclusion that the Rajya Sabha has nothing to do with matters related to finance
 bharat sarkaar ke bajet ko prativarsh rajya sabha ke samaksh bhi rakhaa jaataa he or iske sadsygan us par charchaa karte hai
 Although the Rajya Sabha does not vote on the Demands for Grants of the various Ministries - the matter is exclusively reserved for the Lok Sabha
 However, no money can be withdrawn from the Consolidated Fund of India unless the appropriation bill by both the Houses
 Is not passed
 isi prakaar, vitt vidheyak ko bhi rajya sabha ke samaksh laayaa jaataa he
 In addition, Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committees, which examine the annual grant demands of Ministries / Departments, are joint committees consisting of ten members from the Rajya Sabha
 sabhapati or upasabhapati ke alaava, sabha kaa netaa ek anya aisa adhikari he jo sabha ke kushal or sucharu sanchaalan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha is usually the Prime Minister, if he is a member of it, or a Minister who is a member of this House and who has been nominated by him to act as such
 uskaa praathmik uttardaayitv sabha main sauhardpurn or sarthak vaad-vivaad ke liye sabha ke sabhi virgon ke bich samanvay banaae rakhana he
 For this purpose, he remains in close contact not only with the government, but also with the opposition, ministers and the presiding officer
 vah sabha-kaksh main sabhapith ke daayin ore kii pehali pankti main pehali seat par baithta he taaki vah paraamarsh hetu peethasin adhikari ko sahaj uplabdh rahe
 Under the rules, the arrangement of official business in the House by the Chairman, allocation of days or time for discussion on the President's address, non-official members' work on any day other than Friday, discussion on resolutions on non-days, short-term discussion And the Leader of the House is consulted regarding the consideration and withdrawal of any Money Bill
 mahaan vyaktitv, rashtriya netaa athwa anterrashtriya pratishthit vyakti kii mrityu hone kii sthiti main us din ke liye sabha ke sthagan athwa anyathaa ke maamle main sabhapati unase bhi paraamarsh kar sakate hai
 In the era of coalition governments, their task has become more challenging
 vah yah sunishchit karte hai ki sabha ke samaksh laaye gaye kisi bhi maamle par sarthak charchaa ke liye sabha main har sambhav tathaa uchit suvidha pradaan kii jaae
 He acts as the speaker of the House in expressing the opinion of the House and presenting it on ceremonies or formal occasions
 nimnlikhit sadsy rajya sabha main sabha ke netaa rahe hai: The position of Leader of the Opposition in the legislature has immense public importance
 iskaa mahatv sansadeey loktantr main vipaksh ko di gai mukhya bhoomika se udbhoot hota he
 The task of the Leader of the Opposition is in fact extremely difficult because they have to criticize, point out mistakes and submit alternative proposals / policies which they have no right to implement
 is prakaar unhen sansad or desh ke prati ek vishesh saamaajik jimmedaari nibhaani hoti he
 In the Rajya Sabha till 1969 there was no leader of the opposition in real sense
 us samay tak sarvaadhik sadasyon vaali vipakshi party ke netaa ko bina kisi aupchaarik manyata, darja yaa visheshadhikaar die vipakshi netaa maanane kii pratha thi
 The post of Leader of the Opposition was given official recognition in Parliament by the Opposition Leader Salary and Allowances Act, 1977
 is adhinium ke dwaara rajya sabha main vipakshi netaa, rajya sabha kaa ek aisa sadsy hota he jo kuch samay ke liye rajya sabha ke sabhapati dwaara yatha maanya sabase adhik sadasyon vaale dal kii sarkaar ke vipaksh main hota he
 Thus the leader of the opposition has to fulfill three conditions, namely: uvat vikhyath veda-bhashyakaar the
 It is known by the yajurveda-mantra-bhashya that his father's name was Vajrat
 saath hi vahiin inkaa janmasthan anandpur kaha gaya he : According to the statements of some scholars, this Maharaj was present in the Avantinagri in the eleventh century AD at the time of the banquet

 a Sanskrit text called 'bhavishya-bhakti-mahatmya' describes him as a resident of Kashmir country and contemporary of Mammat and Kaiyat: inhone shukla yajurveda kii kaanv shakha kaa bhashya or rigvedic shaunak praatishakhya naamak granth kii rachana kii

 varahamihir kaa dasvin shatabdi ke ek tikaakar, ne surya siddhant se chah shlokon kaa uddhran kiya he, jinamein se ek bhi ab is siddhant main nahin miltaa he
 The present Surya Siddhanta can then be considered a direct descendant of the available text available to Varahamihira

 If then the jya and radius be multiplied respectively by the measure of the gnomon in digits, and divided by the kojya, the results are the shadow and hypotenuse at mid-day
