 meghalaya main anya paryatak aakarshan is prakaar se hai: Public literature means the literature that the folk creates
 lok-sahitya utana hi pracheen he jitna ki maanav, isliye usamen jan-jivan kii prayek avasthaa, prayek varg, prayek samay or prakruti sabhi kuch samahit he
 According to Dr
 Satyendra- "lok Man is that class of society which is void of the consciousness or arrogance of the classical culture and erudition and which survives in the flow of a tradition
 " Literature related to the general public should be called folk literature
 saadhaaran janajivan vishisht jivan se bhinn hota he at: janasahitya kaa adarsh vishisht sahitya se pruthak hota he
 The folklore of a country or region is a symbol of all those trends from the beginning to the present, which fall under ordinary public nature
 is sahitya main janajivan kii sabhi prakaar kii bhavanaayen bina kisi kritrimata ke samaai rahati hai
 Therefore, if you want to study the entire culture of somewhere, then you will have to do special observation of the folklore
 yah lipibaddh bahut kam or maukhik adhik hota he
 However, efforts have been made to script Hindi folklore for some years and many texts have also appeared in edited form, but oral oral literature is still largely unorganized
 lok jivan kii jaisi saralatam, naiysargik anubhutimayi abhivyanjana kaa chithran lokgeeton va lok-kathaon main miltaa he, vaisaa anyatra sarvatha durlabh he
 People's heart speaks in folk literature
 prakruti swayan gaati-gunagunaati he
 The evaluation of beauty inherent in folk literature is purely cognizant
 adikaal se shruti evam smriti ke sahare jivit rahanevaale loksahitya ke kuch vishesh siddhant hai
 In this literature, only those compositions are accepted or found to be life which, after being formed in many forms from many larynx, take a common form
 yah rachanakram adikaal se abtak jari he
 Many such literary material is still prevalent today, which has not yet acquired uniformity
 paramparaagat evam samuhik pratibhaaon se nirmit hone ke kaaran vidwaanon ne loksahitya ko "apaurushey" kii sangya di he
 Certainly traditional folklore is not the result of any one person's creation
 vaise to iske kai pramaan die ja sakate hai ki ek hi geet, katha yaa kahawat ek sthal par jis rup main hota he duusare sthal par pahonchte-pahonchte uskaa vah rup badal jaataa he kintu ek acha pramaan yah hoga ki saikadon varsh se gaae janevaale lokmahakavy aalh-khand ko aaj tak ekarupata nahin praapt ho saki
 In this work, folk propagation does not accept any restriction
 sfoot geeton main to keval panktiyaan hi idhar udhar hoti hai kintu prabandh geeton evam kathaon main ghatnaayen bhi badalati rahati hai
 Despite all this, almost no change is accepted in the results of those arrangements and stories
 parinaam evam lokprachlit satya tathaa tathy ko aadhaar maanakar ghatnachakra manamaane dhang se chalaae jate hai
 Take the story of Ram
 "naanaa bhanti ram avtara, raamaayan sat koti apaara" vaali baat shat pratishat satya he
 If all of the variations related to Ramkatha are prevalent in the folklore, then if all of them are collected, then this strange type of "lokramayana" will be prepared which will be of a different existence from all the Ramakhyas till date
 ghatnachakron ko dekhte hue kabhi-kabhi to unki sangati baithaana bhi kathin ho jayega
 For example, in folklore, there are many reasons for the birth of Ram, but one very simple reason is that once when Maharaj Dasaratha was going to bathe in the morning Saryu, he appeared early in the morning to Helin who sweeps in the street
 usne taana maaraa ki aaj praat: kaal hi satanheen vyakti kaa darshan hua, pataa nahin din kaise beetegaa
 Dasaratha realized this and then he went to do penance in the forest for his son's attainment with the queen
 is prakaar kaaran doosraa dikhaate hue bhi lokkthakaar dasharath ko phir tapasyawale sthal par le aata he jahaan katha anya ramaayanon kii katha se mil jaati hai
 Many such examples can be found which are not in the result but not in the case of events
 aise parivartanon evam sanshodhano ko loksahitya bahut hi aasaani se sweekaar kar letaa he
 The biggest feature of this literature is that despite its many forms, it has a sense of unity in diversity
 bhashaa ke kalevar ko badalakar bhi bhavapaksh main koi parivartan nahin dikhta
 The same composition which is found in the dialect there at some place, is also found in the other dialect too far
 sfoot geeton ke bhaavon evam prabandhon kii kathaon kii yah yatra kabhi kabhi to itani lambii hoti he ki aashcharya hota he
 Even though humans may set the boundaries of regions and countries, public literature does not accept it
 aisa shaayad isliye sambhav hua hoga ki yatrakaal main pracheen maanav jab kabhi dur gaya hoga to apana sahitya saath letaa gaya hoga or gantavy sthaan par uski chhap chhod aayaa hoga jise vahaan ke logon ne sweekaar kar liya hoga
 This sequence continues even today
 jab koi gramya naihar se sasuraal jaati he to swabhaavat: vah naihar kii un lokrachanaon ko apane saath leti jaati hai jo use samaran rahati hai
 It does not matter if she is married in the dialect area of maike, but when married in another dialect area, she adapts the songs of Naihar to the accents of the local dialect
 us is kaary main sasuraal kii graamyaon dwaara bhi sahaayta milti he
 In this way, the spoilage continues to go on
 lokagayak evam gayikaon kaa yah swabhaav bahut dinon se chalaa aa rahaa he ki yadi unhen kisi kavi kii rachana pasand aa gai to use tod marodakar apni boli ke anukool bana leti hai
 While doing so, sometimes the poet's name is removed and sometimes he is allowed to remain
 pramaan ke liye aaj bhi aise loakgeet sune ja sakate hai - jo sur, kabir, tulsi evam mira ke prakashit granthon main jis tarah milenge lokgayakon ke kanth par unka vah rup nahin hoga
 In some folklore, their names have been spontaneously inserted
 yah pravriti hindi hi nahin anya bhashaaon ke loksahitya main bhi pai jaati he
 Some scholars say that such hymns and songs have been composed by the folk folk themselves and to increase their usefulness, the names of high and erudite poets were added so that most people remember such songs
 par yah baat he nahin
 The folk poet is moderate at this place
 aise bahut se bhajan lokajeevan main na jane kab se chale aa rahe hai jinke rachanakaaron ke bare main pataa hi nahin chalata
 The truth is that the number of such hymns is much more than the number of hymns and they are not inferior in name to the hymns
 lokgayakon kii ek pravriti yah bhi hoti he ki ve sthaneey ghatnaon ko turant bhavabaddh kar lete hai, jaisaa 1934 ke bihar bukamp ke samay hua tha
 Zonal narrative materials that have been around for a long time are the result of this trend
 ghatnapradhan prabandh evam lokkathaayen is pravriti se janm to paa jaati hai kintu deergh jivan maatr unako miltaa he jo janamanas ko adhik kushalta ke saath chooti hai
 The language of folk literature is not the elegant and literary language but the language of ordinary people and its content is limited to the characters, emotions and influences acquired in public life
 yah to lok-sahitya kii pehali maryaada hui
 Its second dignity is not the contribution of the individual but the entire society
 yahi kaaran he ki lok-sahitya par vyakti kii chhap na hokar samgr vyakti-lok kii chhap hoti he
 When we talk about these two main limitations when it comes to craftsmanship, then it becomes clear that no practice or skill for craftsmanship can be reflected in it, because if the law of craft shows us it is social Owing to the compulsion of harmony itself
 vaise prachlit arth main shilp-vidhaan kii baat yahan nahin uthaayi ja sakati he
 People understand that a pre-anxious trade is embedded behind the craft and since there is no possibility of such a trade in folk literature, there is no question of its craft
 par tattvik drushti se dekhne par shilp-vidhaan kaa arth he abhivyakti ko abhivyajya se jodna
 Craftsmanship in folk literature is at its peak, because it is here, at most, resolute, uninterested and disinterested
 lok-sahitya ke mukhyatah chaar bhed kahe jate hai; lok-geet, lok-gaatha, lok-katha or lok-natya
 The distinction between folklore and folklore is so much that folklore operates as a long narrative song and it has a rhyme-oriented rather than a management-narrative saga, while folklore being proselytizing -satha is predominant or in other words event-oriented
 lok-natya jansulabh rangamanch ko drushti main rakhkar angik or vaachik abhinay par aadhrut swang yaa lila tak simit rahata he
 It does not have the ability to make a lasting impact due to special attention being given to timeliness
 lok-kathaon or lok-gaathaon main katha-shilp hi pramukh rahata he, keval lok-gaan aisa prakaar he, jisamen apane samgr rup main shilp-vidhaan viksit ho saktaa he, in chaaron prakaar ke roopon main shilp-vidhaan ke ye ang samaan rup se apekshit hai
 Some of its special trends of folklore are as ancient as this ancient literature
 in pravritiyon kii pushti ko hi vishaal evam vibhinn rachana karaane kaa shrey he
 For convenience, they can be divided into the following types: adikalin maanav ke prakrutipradutt vibhinn kalyankari parinaamon se prabhavit hone ke kaaran unpar jo vishwaas aropi kiya isse sambhddha sahitya iske antargat aata he
 Both the feelings of devotion and fear are embedded in it
 devi devataaon kii puja ke liye rachit tathaa andhvishwaason se sambhddha sahitya isi ke antargat he
 Some of these beliefs are zonal and some are given wide importance
wrote sthaneey uplabdhiyon par sthaneey or vyapak par vyapak rachanaayen milti hai
 Mantras or songs prevalent on the earth, sky, well, pond, river, stream, deeh, doyara, mari masan, tree, crop, plant, animal, demon, demon, deity, totem, brahma and pilgrimage etc
 are part of it 
 jab bhi gramin koi shubh kaary prarambh karte hai to usase sambhddha devi-devataaon ko prasann karne ke liye jin geeton athwa mantron kaa prayog hota he ve sab is sahitya main aate hai
 For the diagnosis of diseases, instead of the songs and mantras of Oshadhi are used
 udhaaharan ke liye sheetala mata ke geeton ko liya ja saktaa he
 For different Gods and Goddesses, the contents of different mantras, songs, worship and indulgence etc
 have not been determined since when
 kisi ko kuch pasand hota he parantu brahm ko in sab ke sthaan par janeu chahie
 According to these songs and mantras change, as well as priests keep changing
 iske antargat aachaar vichaar evam vyaavhaarikta tathaa vibhinn lokmanyataon se sambhddha sahitya aata he

 Different cultures of different castes like - Nai, Dhobi, Ahir, Chamar, Kurmi, Koyri, Noni, Bar, Bhat etc
 and wild and other castes are under the ethnic folk culture
 yadi yah kaha jaae ki kahin kaa sampurna loksahitya vahaan kii vibhinn jatiyon kii samuhik samskruti kaa pratik hota he or anupyukt nahin hoga
 The form of folklore that survives after the removal of ethnic literature will not be a true representation of it

 In this way, those compositions get included in the store of elaborate folklore in a few years
 yahi baat ogan main rache gaye sahitya par lagu hoti he jahaan gramyaayein samay samay par ekatra hoti hai
 In this way, the literature of men and women is separate from birth itself

 While doing nirvah or katiyas in the fields, carrying the bundles of stalks, while doing other collective wages, in pilgrimage or fair journey, near evening bonfires in winter, during festivals and ceremonial events or in short, say that when and where rural women There is an opportunity for the mobilization of men and then there is the creation of folk literature
 aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki bhootkaal main rachaa gaya sabhi loksahitya jivit he or aaj jinka nirmaan ho rahaa he unka ant kabhi nahin hoga

 These literary works are also associated with all the characteristics which give them long life
 praaia: vidvan log yah kaha karte hai ki yadi vistrut loksahitya kaa sangrah nahin kar liya gaya to unka lop ho jayega
 This is true because due to the impact of the era, ancient creations seem inappropriate and then slowly disappear, as is happening at this time

 Due to the spread of education, there is a lack of men and women singing songs in the dialects of villages

 Once Hastinapur King Dushyant went to play forest

 Maharaj Dushyant reached his ashram to see Kanva Rishi
 pukaar lagane par ek ati lavanyamayi kanya ne ashram se nikal kar kaha, “he rajan! maharishi to tirth yatra par gayi hai, kintu aapkaa is ashram main swaagat he
 Seeing that girl, Maharaj Dushyant asked, "child! Who are you?" The girl said, "my name is Shakuntala and i am the daughter of Kanva Rishi
 ” us kanya kii baat sun kar maharaj dushyant aashcharyachakit hokar bole, “maharishi to aajanm brahmacharee hai phir aap unki putree kaise hain?” unke is prashn ke uttar main shakuntala ne kaha, “vastav main mere mata-pita menka or vishwamitra hai
 My mother left me in the forest when i was born, where a bird named Shakunta protected me
 isi liye meraa naam shakuntala padaa
 After that the sight of Kanva Rishi fell upon me and he brought me to his ashram
 unhone hi meraa bharan-poshan kiya
 One who gives birth, one who gives nourishment and one who gives food - all three are called fathers
 is prakaar kanv rishi mere pita huye
 " shakuntala ke vachanon ko sunakar maharaj dushyant ne kaha, “shakuntale! tum kshatriya kanya ho
 Seeing your beauty, i have given my heart to you
 yadi tumhen kisi prakaar kii aapatti na ho to main tumse vivaah karnaa chahta hoon
 "shakuntala was also fascinated with King Dushyant, so he gave his approval
 donon nen gandharv vivaah kar liya
 Maharaja Dushyant spent some time in the forest, while staying with Shakuntala
 phir ek din ve shakuntala se bole, “priytame! mujhe ab apana rajkaarya dekhne ke liye hastinapur prasthaan karnaa hoga
 When Maharishi Kanva returns from his pilgrimage, i will take you away from here and take you to my palace
 ” itnaa kahkar maharaj ne shakuntala ko apane prem ke pratik ke rup main apni swarna mudrika di or hastinapur chale gayi
 One day Durvasa Rishi came to his ashram
 maharaj dushyant ke virah main leen hone ke kaaran shakuntala ko unke aagaman kaa gyaan bhi nahin hua or usne durvasa rishi kaa yathochit swaagat satkar nahin kiya
 Durvasa Rishi considered it his insult and in anger said, "balike! i curse you that anyone you have humiliated me, will forget you
 ” durvasa rishi ke shaap ko sun kar shakuntala kaa dhyaan tutaa or vah unke charnon main gir kar kshamaa prarthana karne lagi
 Surprised by Shakuntala's pardon prayer, Durvasa Rishi said, "if you have a love sign with him, then you will be reminded of that sign
 ” Shakuntala became pregnant due to Maharaj Dushyant's cohabitation
 kuch kaal pashchaat kanv rishi tirth yatra se laute tab shakuntala ne unhen maharaj dushyant ke saath apane gandharv vivaah ke vishay main bataaya
 Maharishi Kanva said, "daughter!" It is not appropriate for a married girl to stay in the father's house
 ab tere pati kaa ghar hi tera ghar he

 maharaj dushyant ke paas pahunch kar kanv rishi ke shishyon ne shakuntala ko unke saamne khadi kar ke kaha, “maharaj! shakuntala aapaki patni he, aap ise sweekaar karen
 Maharaj had forgotten Shakuntala because of the curse of Durvasa Rishi
 atah unhone shakuntala ko sweekaar nahin kiya or us par kulata hone kaa laanchhan lagane lage
 As soon as Shakuntala was insulted, lightning flashed in the sky and her mother Maneka took her away in front of everyone
 jis machhlee ne shakuntala kii anguthi ko nigal liya tha, ek din vah ek machuaare ke jaal main aa fasi
 When the fisherman bit him, a ring came out of his stomach
 machuaare ne us anguthi ko maharaj dushyant ke paas bhent ke rup main bhej diya
 On seeing the ring, Maharaj remembered Shakuntala and repented of his act
 maharaj ne shakuntala ko bahut dhundhvaya kintu uskaa pataa nahin chalaa
 After a few days, after receiving the invitation of Devraj Indra, Maharaj Dushyant went to Indravati's city Amravati to help him in the Devasur struggle
 sangram main vijay praapt karne ke pashchaat jab ve akaash maarg se hastinapur laut rahe the to maarg main unhen kashyap rishi kaa ashram drushtigat hua
 They stayed there for their visions
 ashram main ek sundar balak ek bhayankar singh ke saath khel rahaa tha
 Maneka had left Shakuntala with the sage Kashyapa and that child was the son of Shakuntala
 us balak ko dekh kar maharaj ke hriday main prem kii bhaavana umad padi
 When he proceeded to lift her in the lap, Shakuntala's friend shouted, "O gentle man! You should not touch this child, otherwise a black dora tied in his arm will bite you
 ” yah sun kar bhi dushyant swayan ko na roak sake or balak ko apane god main uthaa liya
 Now Sakhi saw with surprise that the black goat tied in the child's arm has fallen on the earth
 sakhi ko gyaat tha ki balak ko jab kabhi bhi uskaa pita apane god main legaa vah kaala doraa prithvi par gir jaayegaa
 Sakhi was happy and narrated the entire story to Shakuntala
 shakuntala maharaj dushyant ke paas ai
 Maharaj recognized Shakuntala
 unhone apane krity ke liye shakuntala se kshamaa prarthana kiya or kashyap rishi kii ajna lekar use apane putr sahit apane saath hastinapur le aaye
 The name of Maharaja Dushyant and that son of Shakuntala was Bharata

 They live at Dagdi Chawl in Byculla, Satarasta in Mumbai
 2004 main unhen akhil bhartiya sena ummidavaar ke rup main mumbai chinchpokali sansadeey nirvachan kshetra se ek vidhayak chunaa gaya
 Arun Gawli was born on 17 July 1955 in Kopargaon, Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra into a Hindu Ahir caste
 un ke pita gulabrav ahir mil main kaam karke ghar chalaate the
 Gawli married the daughter of Mohammad Sheikh Lal Muzawar Nanhubhai of Vadgaon Panchpeer in Pune district, after whose marriage to Hinduism, his wife named him Asha Gawli
 jise log pyaar se mummy bhi kehete hai
 She has two children Mahesh Gawli and Geeta Gawli
 aisa mana jaataa he ki ek sthaneey balak ke rup main unki "desi jadon" ke yaheen based hone ke kaaran hi gavali kaa mahatva is kshetra main itnaa bad gaya he, yahi visheshta unhen adhikansh anya gaiyr-marathi bhashi sarganaon se vibhedit karti he
 In the Mumbai underworld, Gawli actively carried out kidnappings and illegal acts and was believed to gain support from some powerful politicians and bureaucrats following the vacuum created by Dawood Ibrahim's flight from Mumbai
 jab dhire dhire ve praasangikta khone lage, gavali ne raajnneeti kii mukhyadhara main kadam rakhaa, apane puraane aakaaon ke saath sambandh khatm karne shuru kar die
 Well-known criminals or "goons" - such as Arun Gawli, Rambhai Nayak, Babubhai Reshim, Guru Satam alias Mama, Ashok Chaudhary alias Chhota Babu, Anibhai Parab and Tanya Koli - came to light after the strike of Mumbai's infamous Cotton Textile Mill in 1970, In which millions of workers became unemployed
 keval gavali ko chhodkar uparokt sabhi kii unke mafia pratidwandviyon ke dwaara krurtapurvak hatya kar di gayi
 Suffering from unemployment and starvation, these workers were plagued by poverty and later their children also became criminals
 dagadi chaal sindicket mul rup se di-company ke saath gathbandhit thi lekin baad main andruni jhagadon ke baad inamen vibhaajan ho gaya
 Once a charge-sheeter in the byculla-mahalakshmi-agripada-parel / naigaon-chinchpokli area, the diminutive Gawli is now the undisputed donor of the Dagdi Chawl and his utterances are law in some parts of Mumbai
 gavali ko swargeey rambhai nayak ke dwaara aashray diya gaya tha, jisane 1986 main supaari-king kareem lala ke bhattije, khoonkhaar samad khan ko bandook kii nok par maar daalaa tha or daaud ibrahim ke liye mumbai anderworld kaa nirvivaadit don banane kaa rasta khol diya
 Shortly afterwards Ramnayak himself was killed in an 'encounter' with PSI Rajan Katadhare of Nagpada police in 1988, allegedly at the behest of Dawood Ibrahim, but even today Gawli and his henchmen of Byculla's Dagdi Chal's origins worship him as the Godfather
 mil main kaam karne vaale is majdoor ke bete ne ek kaarkaane main kaam karne kii koshish kii kintu vah kuch samay baad band ho gai or vah dhairya nahin rakh paaya
 He then returned to his dagged house located in a small fort and began to form relationships with Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Rajan
 jab papa gavali ko uske purv sahyogiyon ne maar daalaa, usne gavali giroh shuru kar liya, jisane sampatti ke vivaadon or khatm hoti hui milon main majdoor sanghon par fasaad khadey kiye
 Even when he completed his prison term in the 1990s — charged under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act of 1993 and sentenced to four years in prison — he was held in the Central Jail in Mumbai
 gavali 1997 main jail se mukt ho gaya or usne shiv sena se naata tod kar akhil bhartiya sena banaayi
 Between 1997 and 2004, Gawli has been arrested in more than 15 cases — but none of them have been convicted
 jaahir taur par usne aparaadh ko chhod diya he, phir bhi vah mumbai main rahane vaala ekmaatr don he
 After the 1993 bombings, Gawli suddenly became a Hindu don
 jise shiv sena apana sakati thi or jiske baad gavali ko bal thakare kaa sakriy samarthan praapt hua
 Bal Thackeray said: parantu baad main thakare or shivasena ke saath unke sambandh tut gaye, jab gavali ke ladakon ne nirdayata se kai shivasena vidhayakon or party kaaryakartaaon ko maar diya
 The members of the Shiv Sena, who remained fearless till now, were horribly scared and Gawli had rescued the Shiv Sena's sixes
 unhone apane aap ko apni swayan kii aatank ranneeti ke ant main paaya
 After which the Shiv Sena thought it good to break ties with Gawli
 in sabaki vajah se kai baar gavali jail bhi gaye, lekin shivasena court main kuch sabit nahin kar saki
 "daddy" has been in jail many times and has spent more than 10 years in judicial custody, but has never actually been convicted

 Here, his political party, the All India Army, was prepared with criminals and disgruntled leaders from other parties
 jail bhi uske liye ek surakshit adda tha, jahaan se use apane pratidwandiyon daaud ibrahim / chota shakeel or chota rajan girohon ke dwaara kiye gaye hatya ke prayaason ko rokane main madad mili
 His decision to enter politics and become a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly ensured that he could no longer be killed by the police in an "encounter or encounter"
 gavali ke raajnneetik dizin ko ek jatke kaa saamana karnaa padaa jab uskaa bhatija or party kaa vidhayak, sachinbhaau ahir, khule taur par uske virodh main khada ho gaya or sharad pavaar kii en si pi main shaamil ho gaya
 He then contested against Gawli in the Lok Sabha elections on NCP ticket, in which both were defeated, but the army MP Mohan Rawale won

 Despite all these allegations, Gawli is still a free man due to lack of witnesses
