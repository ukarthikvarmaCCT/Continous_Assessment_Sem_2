kahin laghu gharshan kutrachit bade
 Prithviraj was victorious in all friction
 atah sankhya to aspasht he, parantu prithviraj kii vijay kii nischitata sarvatra dikhaai gai he
 Prithviraj was defeated in the last war, ie in the second war of Narayan
 satluj kaa yuddh prithviraj kaa ghori ke saath prapratham yuddh tha
 In that war, Ghori was horrified
 us yuddh main ghori ke paraajay ke anantar hi parmarvansheey sur naamak samant prativarsh gazani pradesh kar lene jaataa tha
 The details of the Sutlejuddha are not received very often, so the two wars with Prithviraj's Ghori are illusions
 falvarddhika ke shilaalekh main sapramaan satlujayuddh ke vivaran kii pushti hoti he
 The subject of Sutlej war is mentioned in the third part of the epic of Hammir
 nyaaypurna shashan karte hue raja prithviraj ek baar rajsabha main baithe the
 At the same time, a king named Chandraraj appeared before Prithviraj
 vah chandraraj pashchimdisha ke raajaaon kaa pramukh tha
 They were frightened and demoralized by Rajagana
 kyonki ghori naam yanvaraja apane samrajyavistaar kii niti ko poshit karne ke liye anya pradeshon par akraman karata rahaa tha
 All the kings of Paschidadha, defeated by that Yanavaraja, expected help from Prithviraj
 prithviraj ne unke latake hue mukh dekh kar klesh kaa kaaran puchha
 Chandraraj said, "O Rajan! Yavanaraja, named Ghori from Paschidisha, has destroyed many kingdoms while outlawing other kingdoms
 usne jis rajya par akraman kiya, us rajya ke sabhi nagaron ko lut liya gaya or mandiron ko agnisaat kar diya gaya
 The women of the states were raped, due to its cruelty, the condition of those women has become extremely pathetic
 wo jis kisi bhi rajput ko sashastr dekhtaa he, use yamalok bhej detaa he
 Sadhya: Multan is the capital of Ghori
 " Hearing Chandraraj's word, Prithviraj stood indignantly and said, uske pashchaat prithviraj ne ati garv se apane hotho se muchho ko sahalaaya 
 After this, Prithviraj along with Chaturangini Sen attacked Multan
 vikampur or uchh pradesh ke madhya main ek vishaal bhukhand main prithviraj kaa ghori ke saath yuddh hua tha
 Historians believe that the war must have taken place in the year 1182–83
 chuki vah yuddh satluj nadi ke tir par hua tha, atah us yuddh kaa naam satlujayuddh padaa
 Ghori's army escaped from the war due to the invasion of Prithviraj's Vishal Sena
 prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi bana liya
 The pathetic condition of Ghori is not explicitly described in Hammiramahakaavya
 parantu vahaan ullikh he ki, prithviraj ke sammukh natmastak ghori tabaswatantra hua, yada usne prithviraj ko vaarshikkar dene kaa sankalp kiya
 Historians are of the opinion that Prithviraj symbolized keeping the commonwealth in mind and decided to go to war with Ghori
 us yuddh ke parinaam ghori ke liye bhayankar the
 Because after that war, Ghori became the taxpayer of Prithviraj
 prithviraj ke aadesh se parmarvansheey sur naamak samant prativarsh gazani pradesh jakkar kar sweekaar karata tha
 Once upon a time, the Turki people killed him
 parantu sur 74 turk sainiko ko markar mara
 After the death of Sur, Prithviraj appointed an officer named Pratapsingh to collect the tax
 parantu pratapsih swamibhakt or dharmachari nahin tha
 He was a slave to the Turks
 gazani pradesh se jo dhanan kar ke rup main prithviraj ke rajkosh main jaataa tha, us dhan kaa bada bhaag pratapsingh maarg main hi 'masjid' main or vahaan ke yawanon main daan kar detaa tha
 If anyone asked anything about charity, then he used to say that, i am giving donations for the removal of Earth's odd planet
 
 Prithviraj several times humiliated Ghori by imprisoning him
 prithviraj prativarsh ghori se dand ke rup main vaarshikkar sweekaar kiya karte the
 Shilalekha also confirms Prithviraj's taxation
 prithviraj ke kar sweekaran ke vishay main anek farsi kavion ne bhram samutpaadit kiya, parantu rajasthanrajya se falvardhika naamak shilaalekh se prithviraj kii kar sweekaran kii ghatana pusht ho jaati he
 The inscription was established at the time of renovation of the temple of Phalodidevi located at the place called Phalvardhika
 wo shilaalekh 1555 vikram sanvatsar ke chaitramas kii shuklaikadshi ko guuruuvaar ke din prasthaapit kiya gaya tha
 The ruler of Dahladesha was the Paramaravasi king Madhudeva
 uskaa yashasvi putr sur prithviraj kii ajna se prativarsh vaarshik dand swikaarne ke liye gazani pradesh jaataa tha
 Once he went alone to do it alone
 ekaaki sur ke upar ghori ke sainikon ne akraman kar diya
 The warrior Sur killed his life at 74 and finally gave up his life
 1177 varsh main prithviraj dwaara yada nagarjun kaa daman kiya gaya tha, tabanagarjun daman ke pashchaat ajmeru prasaad main utsav tha
 At that festival, Ghori sent a messenger to Prithviraj for a treaty or dedication
 yada ghori ne sapadalakshasamrajya main doot bheja tha, tab hi uski gujarat rajya par akram kii yojana thi
 Therefore, it was his desire to invade the state of Gujarat in collaboration with the Chauhan dynasty by forming the basis of the enmity between the Chalukyas and the Chauhans
 parantu prithviraj ke virodh karne par ghori swayan hi gujarat par akraman karne nikal padaa
 By acting on his military expansion policy for one year, he invaded Gujarat in the year 1178
 parantu gujarat rajya ke maarg main uchh pradesh aata tha
 Therefore, he attacked the Uchchha region first
 multan pradesh se bharat pahuche ghori ne uchh pradesh par akraman karnaa chaha
 But he was frightened by the Rajputs of Uttar Pradesh
 rajputon ke sammukh ghori kii vijay asambhav si thi
 Therefore, he planned to dominate the region from treachery
 ghori ko guptcharo se gyaat hua ki, uchh pradesh ke raja ke sambandh apni raji se saral nahin arthath unke sambandh main katutaa he
 So Ghori sent the message to Rajni
 us sandesh main usne likhaa ki, "yadi aap apane pati ko vish dekar maar daalen, tarhi main aapke saath vivaah karuunga"
 In response to Ghori's message, Rajini wrote, "I have grown old
 main vivaah karke kya karuungi? parantu meri putree ke saath aap vivaah kare to, main aapkaa eepsit kaary kar sakati hoon
 After receiving the response of Rajni, Ghori sent his consent letter
 kyonki uskaa uddesh uchh pradesh par aadhipaty sthaapan karnaa tha
 The subject of vivahadi was only part of its treachery
 tatpashchaat uchhpradesh kii raji ne apane pati ko vish dekar maar diya
 Locked the fort, treasury and armory and sent his key to Ghori
 is prakaar chal se or kapat se ghori uchh pradesh kaa adhipati ban baitha
 Ghori was the ruler of a small state, then he sent the princess and princess of the Uttar Pradesh to the Ghazni region
 yada rajkumaari ko apni mata kaa krity pataa chalaa, tabausane mata kaa tiraskaar kar diya
 Rajini gave up her life due to her disloyalty and hatred of her daughter
 uske pashchaat kuch din sansar ke dukh sah kar rajkumaari ne bhi deh tyaag diya
 Dr
 Habibullah is of the opinion that there is no evidence of the rule of Bhattirajas in Uttar Pradesh
 atah ebn aseer, yahiya sarhindi, nizamuddin ahamed, farist ityadi ke rachita ne is ghatana ko kalpinic kaha he
 But Ghori superseded the treachery over Uttar Pradesh, all historians are agreed on this subject
 uchhpradesh ke upar swadhipaty praapt kar ghori ne maarg main kiradu naamak sthal par sthit someswaramahadev ke mandir ko lut liya
 That temple of Shiva was famous in the state of Rajasthan at that time
 sundararatnon se alaakrut bhavy us mandir ko lut kar us mandir kaa purnataya naash karke ghori gujarat rajya kii ore aage badhaa
 And through the state of Sandrao, the Chauhans of Nadolia attacked the capital named Nadol
 us samay nadol pradesh par chalukyavanshayo ke samant klahanvansh ke raja shashan kar rahe the
 In that Nadol city in Rajasthan, temples were set on fire by the Turks and soldiers and the citizens were looted
 ghori dwaara nadol nagar kaa jo adhampatan hua, uske samachar prithviraj ko mili
 After that, in anger, he pledged to Ghori's door
 vah apane sainiko ke saath shastr lekar sajj ho gaye
 The young Prithviraj was of the opinion that, “the problem of Chalukya and Chauhan dynasty is Grihasamsya
 baahar se aayaa koi mlechh bharatdesh ke upar akraman karke bharat kii asmita kii hatya nahin kar saktaa
 So we should give military assistance to]

 he rajan ! is samay krodh karnaa uchati nahin
 Fortunately, this opportunity has been received
 oont bhi bhakshan kar le, aise sarp par garuda kyon kopan karen? arthath anayas hi ye avasar praapt hua he, hamaare pratidwandvi paraspar yuddh karke apni shakti or bal ko ksheen kar lenge
 To substantiate his argument, Camas narrated the mythology of the demons and Tilottama, named Sundop and Sunda
 yatha sundope or sand naamak do asur bhai tilottama ke soundarya main aasakt paraspar yuddh karke nasht ho gayi the, tathaa inkaa bhi naash ho jaayegaa ye aashay tha
 This political argument of Camas has been condemned by all historians
 kyonki apane desh ke vishay main vichaar kar yuva prithviraj ne to chalukyon ke saath apni samasya ko gruhasamasya hi gina kar gujarat rajya kii sahaayta ke liye udyat hue the
 But under the complication of Camas, the confused young Prithviraj remained the observer of the attack on that province
 kuch itihasvide kehete hai ki, yadi us samay prithviraj ne gujarat rajya kii sahaayta kii hoti, arthath gujarat praant par jo akraman hua tha, uskaa pratikar kiya hota, to vartmanbharat kii seemaa or vartmanbharat kii sthiti bhinn hoti
 By establishing his suzerainty over the fort of Nadol and looting the entire Nadol city, the temples of Hathikundi place situated at Sewadi from Ghori Mirpur also reached the place called Jhodi
 tatpashchaat abu parvatamala ke sameep sthit kasahrad pahucha
 When Ghori reached Kasahrad, only then the huge army of the state of Gujarat blocked its route

 Dharavarsha, the Paramara dynasty ruler of Abu Pradesh and Chandravati region and Naikidevi, the mother of Moolraj II, the abbot of the Chalukya dynasty, also participated in the war

 In the epic of Prithviraj Vijay, it is mentioned that, a messenger from the state of Gujarat had reached Sapadalaksh to give news of the victory of the state of Gujarat
 prithviraj ke sammukh usne turushk ke paraajay kaa sampoorn vivaran vistaar se bataaya
 Prithviraj properly respected the messenger and allowed him to leave
 tatpashchaat prithviraj ne apane mantri ko rashtraniti te vishay main bodh diya
 Prithviraj strongly advised Camas for the development of his national policy
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, 1191-1192 madhya main sapadalaksh jaisaa vishalsamrajya turk ke akraman se parajeet hua
 The failed diplomacy of Camas was behind him
 jaise mahmud gaznavi ne 150 varshon pehle gujarat rajya ke upar akraman karke gujarat rajya ko lutaa tha, vaise hi ghori kii ipsa thi
 But at the bottom of the Abu Mountains, Ghori became abject
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, ghori kii mahmud gaznavi ke saath tulana ayogy hi he
 Because the warrior intellect of Ghaznavi used to be very sharp during the sixties
 usase vipareet ghori ghori swabhaav se hi lampat, dhoort or kapati tha
 In all the battles he won, he took the path of treachery
 gujarat rajya main parajeet hue ghori ne 1182-83 varsh main lahore pradesh par akraman kar diya
 After that, the boundary of Ghori's kingdom reached near the end of Panjab Rajya, that is, near Sutlejanadi
 satlujanadi se duusare tat se sapadalakshasamrajya kii seemaa armbh hoti thi
 Sirhind and Farishta have addressed the first military residence of the Samadalaksha Samajya with 'tapahinda'

 After that there was a war of Sutlej war, in which Ghori was deserted

 Minhaj Siraj has named the battlefield as Narayan
 tarikhe farishta granth main yudhakshetra kaa naam taraayan likhaa he
 Elsewhere, his statement is that Tarain ut Tarayan is still famous as Taravadi
 dow khalik ahamed nijaami or dow habibullah in dono ne farista-granth kaa samarthan kiya he
 Because both of them are of the opinion that, due to printer's defect, Narayan was replaced instead of Tarayan
 dow habibullah jis 'taraayan' kshetra kaa samarthan karte hai, vah thaneshwar se dakshindisha main 14 mile dur he
 But according to him, the place called Toravana was a Tarayan war zone
 wo toravana kshetra rajasthanrajya ke sirsamandal ke kalamvat naamak upmandal ke samipsth sthal he
 Dr
 Habibullah's bibliography is the treatise of General Cunningham
 'orcological survey off india' is main general kaningham ne likhaa he ki, tarin yuddh bhatinda se 27 mile dur sthit kisi sthaan main hua tha
 The place is known as Sadah: Toravana
 kaningham ne bhatinda or sirsa jalle ke madhya main sthit jis kshetra kii baat kii he, uskaa aadhaar 'yahia sarhindi' naamak pustak he
 The author named Yahiya Sirhindi has mentioned in the book titled 'date Mubarak Shahi' that the battle of Khittaye Surusuti took place in Tarainkshetra
 'tarikhe mubarakashahi' kaa sampaadan shamsulaummaa mohammad hidaayat hossain ne jan hastpraton ke aadhaar par kiya he, un main se kuch rajasthanrajya ke azamgarh zille main bhi hai
 In one of the Tino manuscripts of darul-musnafin-place of Azamgarh district, only "sarasuti" in place of "khitatye Sarsuti", "tarai" in place of "mentarine" is printed
 vaastavya main wo yuddh narin kshetra hi tha
 The section of Nasiri and tarikhe-mubaratshahi is also of the same opinion
 'yahia sarhindi' ke shuddh mudrit aitihaasik paath main miltaa he ki, saraswatinadi ke tir par 'tarai' main sthit narineshetra main hi yuddh hua tha
 There is no flaw anywhere in the text of the Persian language, but seeing the English translation or ignorance, this defect has been entered
 is prakaar yudhsthal ke vishay main vivaad samudbhoot hua
 Discussion by historians concludes that Prithviraj's war with Ghori took place in Narayankshetra itself
 iskaaka drudhtya anek itihasvid samarthan karte hai
 Prof
 Es Hodiwala is also included in them
 atah bhugolic or aitihasikatathyon se yudhakshetra kaa naam narin hi tha
 Because Taravadi is the nearest place to Narayankshetra, it is also called narayan-taravadi war
 sirsa jile main sthit torwanaa-sthal narayan yudhakshetra ke rup main gyaan bhraamak sandarbhon kaa parinaam tha
 Narayankshetra is 135 km from Delhi, Narayankshetra is 21 km from Thaneshwar
 ye 'tarikhe farista' pustak main bhi ullikhit hua he
 The Tornavana site mentioned by Cunningham is 342 km from Delhi, so according to the geographical details, General Cunningham's information also proves to be arithmetic
 1175 se 1191 tak ghori dwaara bharat ke sameepavarti pradeshon main or bhartiyapradesho main c bahut akraman kiye
 The first war of Narayan took place in the year 1190
 us yuddh main ghori kii paraajay hui tathaa prithviraj ne ghori ko bindi bhi banaaya tha
 For the first time in 1190 year, Ghori systematically attacked the Sapdalaksha Empire
 satluj nadi ko langhakar sapadalakshasamrajya ke sarhind-sthal par ghori ne akraman kiya
 Ghori was symbolized by the soldiers of the fort of Sirhind, but Ghori established success establishing the dominion over the fort
 sarhind ke durg par aadhipaty prasthaapit kar ghori jiyauddin tolki naamake apane sevak ko shashan dakar gazani pradesh waapas chalaa gaya 
 Ziauddin Tolki was the son of Minhaj's uncle, the author of a book called 'tabkate Nasiri'
 apane bhai ke vishay main minhaj ne likhaa he ki, durg ke rakshan ke liye ghori ne 12,000 ashwarohi sainikon ko niyukt kiya tha
 In the book titled 'tarikhe Farishta', the number of horsemen is 1040
 prithviraj ne jab sarhind ke durg par akraman ke samachar paae, tab vah apane samanton ke saath sarhind pradesh kii ore batch gayi
 Prithviraj's army consisted of 2,00,000 Ashwarohi and 3,000 elephants
 farista-pustak main ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ne sarhind pradesh kii ore vishalsena ke saath yatram armbh kar di he ye jab ghori ko gyaat hua, tab usne bhi vishaal sanybal ko saath lekar sarhind pradesh kii ore yatra armbh kar di
 Sadya: The place which is famous by the name 'taravadi' was then Narayan, a fierce battle took place between the two armies in that area
 narin ke yuddh kii vyuharachna kaa varnan 'farista' naamak pustak main praapt hota he
 It is mentioned that when Ghori saw the vast army of Rajputs, Ghori also divided the army into three parts to disguise his army
 rajputon kii sena ko dekhakar ghori ke man main vishaad samudbhoot ho gaya
 Fearing defeat, he quickly divided his army into three parts as the Rajput army had three parts
 madhyabhaag kii sena kaa netritv ghori ne kiya tha
 The army of Prithviraj divided into three parts, the Gajsena of the middle division was adorned to attack
 prithviraj kii sena main akraman kaa mukhyadayitv ashwarohi sena kaa tha
 The cavalry army consisted of swordsmen and shuldhari soldiers divided into three divisions
 padaati or gajasena ke madhya main sanchaalak ke rup main bhattarkaparmeshwar tha
 He was leading the battle of Arudh Bharateshwar Prithviraj on his beloved
 jab sena apane shatruon ke pratikar karne ke liye teen bhaag main vibhakt hoti thi, tab viruddh sena ke upar bheeshan akraman kaa daayitv vam bhaag or dakshin bhaag kaa hota tha
 As part of the Samratantra, the general commander makes AC architecture
 donon senaayen ek duusare kii ore dodne lagi
 First the cavalry army of Prithviraj's back attacked Ghori's left and south
 ghori ke sainik us ghaatak akraman ko sahane main shakt nahin the
 Therefore, to protect the lives, they started migrating towards the middle of the army
 is prakaar turksena kaa vyuh dhwast ho gaya
 All Ghori's divisions were mixed
 us vyuh ke dhwast hone se anek yavansainik maare gayi
 Due to the invasion of Rajputs, the legendary soldiers of Turkasena also abandoned the battlefield and fled
 yuddh ke armbh pashchaat ghori dehalipradesh ke samant govind kii ore gaya
 Seeing Ghori coming towards him, Govind also went ahead to fight with him
 tatpashchaat un donon main yuddh hua
 Ghori struck Govind with his prick
 vah shul govind ke mukh main pravisht ho gaya
 Govind's teeth also fell from the shulprabhar
 shul govind ke mukh se pravisht ho kar kanth tak antar chalaa gaya
 After that Govind also attacked
 govind ne apane shul ke prahaar se ghori kii bhujaa par aghat kiya
 That shock was very powerful
 bhaybheet ghori apane ashv kii disha ko parivartit kar yudhakshetra se bhaag gaya
 But the hurt Ghori fell to the ground
 rajput sainiko dwaara ghori ko bandi bana liya gaya
 In this way, Prithviraj established complete suzerainty over the Turk soldiers
 minhaj ke pustak main ullekh he ki, prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi bana liya
 After this, Prithviraj freed Ghori along with the soldiers of Toorak after Ghori apologized
 prithviraj kii vijay ke anantar ghori kii sena par koi bhi hatyachaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 Prithviraj sent all the soldiers towards the safe balance
 prithviraj kii is udaartaa kaa bhartiya rashtravaadi itihaaskaaro devara katu aalochana kii gai he
 According to the historians, the main reason for the defeat of Prithviraj in the second war of Narayan was the liberation of Ghori
 itihasvid dow bindhyanath chouhan kehete hai ki, bhartiyasanskruti main sharnaarthi kaa vadh nishiddh he
 The assassination of the defeated army soldiers was unfair to the Indian war tradition
 kyonki manusmriti main kaha he ki – Neither the incidents nor the parables 7
93 Manusmriti॥ arthath jinke shastr nasht ho gayi hai, jo shok se vidagdh ho rahe hai, jo gabhirathya aahat hai, jo bhaybheet hai, jo yuddh se palayan kar rahe hai, unka vadh anuchit he
 After the defeat of Ghori in the first Narayan war, Ghori was freed by the order of Prithviraj
 vahaan uske sainik uski pratiksha kar rahe the
 In Lahore region, Ghori stayed for two months
 kyonki yuddh main aahat ghori kii sharirak vrin ke liye oshadhi aavashyak thi
 Lahore fort was also renovated by Do Mas Ghori
 tatpashchaat vah apni sena ke saath gazani pradesh chalaa gaya
 According to Isami's statement, after reaching Ghazni region, Ghori gave death to a king named Ghaznavi-dynasty, Khushro Malik and his son
 ghori ne gazani pradesh pahuch kar narin ke pratham yuddh main jo sainik rankshetra se palaayan kar gayi the, unako bhi dand diya
 It is mentioned in the book 'farishta' that when Ghori reached Ghazni region, he did not torture Afghan territorial soldiers, but punished them by insulting Ghori-clan, Khorasani-clan and Khalji-clan soldiers
 ghori ne un sainikon ke mukh main apakv yav se bhare syut bandhavakar nagar unako ghumaya
 Ghori's order was that soldiers who do not eat unruly yachts from the bed should be separated from their bodies
 narin yuddh ke anantar ghori kii manahosthiti avsaad, klesh or aatmaglani se yukt thi
 It is mentioned in the texts such as the strata Nasiri and Tarikhe Farishta, that Ghori had become so sad that he had also abandoned food and water
 din or raatri vah apane paraajay ke dukh kii agni main jalataa rahata tha
 He did not even sleep with his wife
 tatpashchaat uski mata kii prerana se ghori punah yuddh ke liye sajj ho gaya
 
 ek baar ghori abak ke saath baith kar narinyuddh main hue paraajay kii samiksha kar rahaa tha
 Then Aibak said to Ghori, our horses are good, but they used to get scared after seeing the faces of Indian elephants
 kyonki pehle kabhi bhi unka bhartiya hathion ke saath yuddh kaa anubhav nahin tha
 So they were scared near Indian arms
 yahi mukhya kaaran he, jis se ham bhartiya sena ke sammukh parajeet hue
 Knowing the reason for his defeat, how should Ghori do horse training before the advance war? The Aibak also asked for its solution
 vah bolaa, gili mitti se or kashtha se hathion kaa nirmaan karaao
 Decorate those arms as Indian elephants are adorned
 tatpashchaat un hathion ke chaaro ore ashwarohi dwaara yuddh kii sthiti kaa nirmaan karvaa kar ashwon ko nirbhay banaao
 In this way, even in front of Indian elephants in war time, the horse will be able to symbolize them fearlessly
 ghori ke paraamarsh ke anusaar abak ne ashv prashikshan karavaaya
 He himself started devising war related policies
 usne sachal-sainik-dal kii rachana kar lee
 The main task of that mobile party was that in case of any array of soldiers weakened during the war, this team could go from one party to an upper team in a war zone
 is prakaar yuddh kshetra main yadi kisi dal kaa samarthy durbal ho jaataa he, tarhi ye dal us apper dal kii sahaayta karke yuddh kshetra main apane bal ko santulit kar saktaa he
 Soldiers mounted on horse should also be able to wield arrows, so AIB was trained by its soldiers
 abak kii ranneeti kaa varnan farsi-bhashaa ke aitihaasik sahitya main to praapt nahin hota, parantu prasiddh yuddh vigyaani aar e smile ke pustak main ullekh miltaa he
 a description of an armor is also found in the book Futuhussalatin written by Isami
 us kavach kaa naam 'karvaa' tha
 That armor was made from oxen
 us kavach ke donon ore kapaas yaa oon sthapit kiya jaataa tha
 The Indian Army should attack the troop of Turk Army every now and then, so that those soldiers will not get hurt
 That was the purpose of making that armor
 is prakaar ghori ne aibak ke saath milakar praharatmak nit or rakshaatmak niti kii rachana kar lee
 Historians believe that Ghori's army consisted of various commanders of the Afghan army, Ottoman army, Tajik army and Tulak army
 phutuhussalatin naamak pustak main kuch senapatiyon ke naam milte hai
 As- 1
 kharbak – iskaa daanav jaisaa sharir tha
 He was the commander of the advance party
 2
 alba – vam vibhaag kii sena kaa senapati tha
 3
 Mukalba - was a warrior of the Central Army
 4
 kharmel – kendriya sena kaa yoddha tha
 5
 Qutbuddin Aibak - was the general manager of the entire army
 yudhakshetra main ye sarvada ghori ke sameep hi bana rahata tha
 6
 Tajuddin Yalduz - was the commander of a party
 7
 nasiruddin kubacha – haraval-dal kaa netritv ye kar rahaa tha
 8
 Muhammad bin Mahmud - He was the uncle of Bakhtiyar Khalji
 yah patibaddh or kushal senanayake tha
 All these commanders were skilled in operating the army in the Rann region
 ghori kii sena ko chhod kar in senapatiyon ki apni vyaktigat sena bhi thi
 Shortly before Ghori's visit to India, according to Minhaj's statement, 12,000 cavalry of Tulak-dynasties were included in his army with Tulki's insistence
 1191 tame varshe ghori ityeshah bhaaratan prati yatram aarbhat 
 Ghori reached Lahore region via Peshawar region and Multan region
 ghori ne lahore ke durg main rahakar prithviraj ke viruddh shadyantra bhi armbh kar diya
 On the one hand he was busy with his military arrangements, military training and dispatching of intelligence, on the other hand he sent his messenger to Ajayameru fort
 yadhyapi vah jaanata tha ki, prithviraj uske patr kaa kya pratyuttar denge, tathaapi usne ajayameru ke durg main doot ko bheja
 Because he only wanted to spend time
 uske peeche uskaa uddesh tha ki, uski sena yuddh ke liye sajj ho or sahyogi nishtha kaa punah pareekshan ho sake
 Ghori's messenger appeared before Prithviraj
 ghori dwaara pradutt patr usne padhaa
 It was mentioned in that letter, Prithviraj! Wear the jewels of independence in your ears and be present in my palace, and you renounce Islam
 anya farsi lekhakon ne bhi ukt kathan kaa samarthan kiya he
 The angel meets that, Ghori reached Lahore region with his army, then Kawamulmulk Rukunuddin Hamza sent Ajayemaru Durg to deliver his message
 us main "raja islam-dharm kaa angikara karen" ye sandesh likhaa hua tha
 It is mentioned in the book named Farishta that Prithviraj heard the message from the mouth of the messenger, then he used abusive language for Islam
 prithviraj ne ismaal-dharm ke anuyaayi raajaaon ko bhi apshabd kahe the
 Then Kavamulmulk was sent back
 1990 varsh main ghori ko parajeet kar prithviraj kaa samrajya bharat kii pramukh shakti ke rup main gina jane laga tha
 Due to the power of Prithviraj, the heart of the opponents started to suffer schizophrenia
 jo raja prithviraj se parajeet hue the, ve avasar praapt kar prithviraj ke upar aghat karne ko tatpar the
 King of Jammu region Vijaydev became the chief assistant of Ghori
 prabandhsangrah or prithviraj raso kavy main jammupati ke ghori kii sahaayta ke ullekh praapt hote hai
 Nayachandra Suri has written in his book that the king of Jammuupradesh sent his son Narasimhadeva with his army to Narayankshetra
 hegg naamak itihasvid ne apane pustak main ullekh kiya he ki, naranay ke dwitiya yuddh main bharat kaa sabhi raja upasthit the, parantu raashtra swatantrata kii raksha te liye bhi kannauj pradesh ke raja jayachand ne apane jamata prithviraj kii sahaayta nahin kii
 He did not fight even in the first war of Narayan
 narin ke dwitiyayuddh main prithviraj kii paraajay ke kaaran hi bharat main muslimsatta kii sthiti drudh ho gai, kyonki jayachand rashtrashatruon ke saath sandhi kar baitha
 According to James Todd, King Jayachand of Kannauj region and the King of Patan region invited Muhammad Ghori for the complete destruction of Prithviraj
 jejakabhuktipradesh ke raja chandel bhi ghori kaa sahyogi tha
 The Shalivahanbhati clan of Jaisalmer region was consuming the Rajsukh only with the blessings of Ghori
 yuddh main hemelatobhaati-vansh to ghori kii sena kaa mahattavapurn uttardaayitv vahan kar rahe the
 Ghori's financial support, military help and information were helped by the regent king of the Sapadalakshtra kingdom
 yada ghori apane sainya ke saath sapadalakshasamrajya kii seemaa ke sameep pahunchaa, tabasapadalaksh-samrajya ke chaaron ore sthit rajyon ne sapadalakshasamrajya kii seemaa par utpaat aarabh kar diya
 His aim was that, the army of the warring Prithviraj would be divided from all sides
 dwitiya narin yuddh ke samay unki yojana ke anusaar hi hua
 Prithviraj's army was waging war in various areas of the kingdom of Sapadalaksha
 sapadalakshasamrajya kaa pradhansenapati narinyuddh ke samay un yudho main hi rat tha
 Another commander of Prithviraj named Udayaraja was also at war elsewhere
 ghori ko pratham narinyuddh main parajeet kar prithviraj uttarabhartiya ke kshetro main charchaa kaa vishay bane gayi the
 Prithviraj's former enemies were waiting for his downfall
 atah yada ghori ne prithviraj ke saath yuddh kiya, tabasamipsth rajyone prithviraj ke samrajya par akraman kar diya
 Those states were mainly Kannauj, Kalinjar, Anhilpatan states on the east-south border of Sapradalakshtra kingdom
 bhimdev kii mata nikidevi jejakabhukti ke chandelvansheey ke shaasha paramardidev kii putree thi
 In the year 1182-83, those two states were also occupied by Prithviraj
 dusri ore sanyogita haran se cruddh jayachand kisi bhi prakaar prithviraj kaa vinaash dekhnaa chahta tha
 The incident of coincidence haran took place only during the first war of Narayan
 jin itihasvidon ne tatkaaleen paristhition kaa adhyayan kiya, unka kathan he ki, prithviraj yada digvijay abhiyaan main the, tab unhone anek raajaaon ke manbhang kiye
 But Prithviraj gave life to everyone
 is prakaar digvijay abhiyaan se prithvirajki sena main yaa seemaa main koi vruddhi nahin hui thi, api tu unke shatruon kii sankhya main pratidin vrudghi ho rahi thi
 Defeating enemies and giving them life became the main reason for the defeat of Prithviraj
 sanyogitaaharan ke anantar prithviraj adhik samay tak navvivaahit sanyogita ke saath hi samay vyateet karne lage
 This led to the emergence of a vicious cycle in Ajayameru Prasad
 prithviraj kii padmavati naamak raji ke man main sanyogita ke prati dwesh samudbhoot ho gaya
 In Ajaymeru Prasad, there were frequent squabbles between them
 prithviraj dwaara upekshit padmavati ne vaseekaran prayog se prithviraj ke upar aadhipaty kaa praytn kiya
 He killed a pregnant cow due to tantric method
 uske pashchaat us gaay ke prajnan ang lekar apni tantrikavidhi ko armbh kiya
 After proving the Tantrikavidhi, Prithviraj was subjugated to Padmavati
 prithviraj jab padmavati ke tantrapash main baddh the, tabhi prasaad main ek anya avanchhneeya ghatana ho gai
 In the absence of Prithviraj, the mahamandaleshwar named Kaimas of Sapadalakasamrajya used to see the overall rule
 vah kaimaas karnati naamak daasi ke saath avaidh sambandh main bandh chukaa tha
 As time passed, both of them used to conduct their work in the Raj Bhavan in the darkness of the night
 ek baar raatri main padmavati ne prasaad ke ek prakoshth main kaimaas ko us daasi ke saath abhadrasthiti main dekh liya
 Padmavati smuggled Prithviraj to the work of Camas
 prithviraj cho padmavati ke tantrapash main baddh he the, atah vibhram sthiti main prithviraj uchitanirnay karne main asamarth the
 After that, when Kaimas was engaged with the maid at night, Prithviraj reached there and killed Kaimas there
 kaimaas ke daasi ke saath paapasmbandh the ye to ajayameru prasaad kaa durbhaagya hi tha
 But the reason for the slaying of the Camas is mentioned in the ancient management
 puratanprabandhsangrah anusaar prithviraj ke rajasav adhikari pratapsingh garjani pradesh main kar sweekaar ne ke liye jaataa tha
 Once, Pratap Singh donated one Lakshpan to the 'masjid' in Garjani region
 yada kaimaas ne raja ko kaha, "he dev ! gazani pradesh se kar ke rup main jo dhan ham pate hai, usase hamaare rajkaarya hote hai
 But revenue officer Pratapsingh wastes that money in such works "
 raja ne jab kaimaas ke aarope vishay main pratapsingh ko puchha, tab vah bolaa, "dev ! aapke upar pratikulgrah prabhaav ko jaanakar hi maine us dhan kaa vyay kiya tha
 Because the astrologer told me about the trouble in your life "
 anukshan hi pratapsingh ne shaniah prithviraj ke kaanon main kaimaas ke viruddh chugali kar di
 He said, God! Minister Camas keeps calling Turks and Gentiles here again and again
 pratapsingh ke vachan sunakar cruddh prithviraj ne kaimaas kaa vadh kar diya
 In the above story, we cannot test the truth and untruth, but the available evidence is clarifying the two topics
 ek to ghori ke guptchar tantra ke sampark main ajayameru shashan ke anek sadsy the, un main se pratapsih pramukh tha
 The slaughter of the Second Camas is also confirmed
 parantu deshadroh vaa kamprasang main ye gyaat nahin hota
 According to a book titled Futuhussalatin, news of the slaying of Camas in the Rajprasad of Ajayameru region was reported by Ghori detectives to Ghazni region
 dwitiya narin yuddh kii tithi ke vishay main anek tark hai
 Different dates are found in different books
 un pustako ko trin vibhaago main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Those divisions are Prithviraj Raso, Persian writers and dates according to Indian source
 sanivasar sankranti krak
 Shravan Adho Mass
 arthath, 1158 vikram sanvatsar ke shaniwasar ke din prithviraj kaa ghori ke saath yuddh hua tha
 At that time, the month of Shravan was half past and there was consternation
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullikhit tithi ke anekon ne khandan kiya he
 Because many Indian texts and other Persian texts also present other dates
 hasan nijaami ne tajul masir naamak pustak main ullikhit kiya he ki, 'hijrisan' 587 main ghori ne gazani pradesh se bharat kii ore yatra armbh kii thi
 He was defeated in the Narayan war, then in the Narayan war, the victorious Ghori invaded Hansi region in the 'ramzan' month of 'hijrin' 588
 abak us samay koharaam pradesh main tha ouk ghori kaa saath dene ke liye usne bhi haansi pradesh kii ore yatra armbh kar di
 In the book Gulshane Ibrahimi, Farishta has mentioned that, C
 In 587, Ghori started the journey from Ghazni region in 588 h
 Reached Narayan's battlefield
 farsigrantho main jo tithi ullikhit kii gai he, uskaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karke yuddh kii tithi ke vishay main kinchit maargdarshan praapt hota he
 The war started on the twenty-ninth day of January month of 1190, after which the war was completed on the seventeen day of January month of 1191
 arthath 1190 varsh ke janvari maas kii untiis dinank ke purv kisi bhi samay ghori ne bharat kii ore yatra armbh kar di thi
 Ghori won the Narayan war before seventeen days of January month of 1191
 farsi granth anusaar tab 'ramajaan' naamak yavanmaas armbh hone vaala tha
 If it is 'ramadan' month on the seventeenth day of January month of 1191 year, then only the date mentioned in the Persian scripture is valid
 hi
 san ke yavanpanchang kaa armbh 1 muharram se hota he
 In this way, 588 H
I
 was started on the 18th of January month of 1192 year
 us din shaniwasar tha
 According to 'ramadan' month is the tenth month according to Yavanpanchang, 'ramadan' month was started on the tenth day of September month of 1192 years
 nijaami kaa kathan he ki, narin kaa yuddh 'ramajaan'-maas se purv hi purna ho chukaa tha
 Therefore, from the seventeenth day of January-month of 1192 year, the war of Narayan was completed till the tenth day of September-month of 1192 year
 farsigranthon main yuddh kaa kaal to jaan padataa, parantu narin ke dwitiyayuddh kii nishchit tithi nahin praapt hoti
 Jainacharya Jinprabhusuri was a contemporary of King Muhammad Tughlaq of Dehli
 un donon ke samaankaleenta ke anek pramaan uplabdh hai
 He is the creator of a book called Jainacharya Kanyanayaniyamahaveerpratimakalpa
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, vah pustak khartargachhpattavali se bhi adhik upyogi he
 In the twelfth era of the Kanyanayaniyamahavirpratimakalpa, mention is received that in 1248 Vikram Samvatsar, Ghori was killed by Ghori in the place of Chauhanakuladivakara Sriputhviraj, then the Turks came to power in Ajmeru Prasad
 atah ajayameru ke mantri mahashreshtiramdev ne soochna prasaarit kar di ki, "yavan jainstygh kii murtion kaa naash kare, uske purv hi sabhi jainacharya murtion ko bhoomi main gupt guha banaakar surakshit kar len"
 In 1248 Vikram Samvatsar, a razor inscription was produced
 ustaraan pradesh se anek jeern jainamandir or virasmarak mili thi
 Many inscriptions were found in Veerasmarco
 un shilaalekh main ullekh he ki, 1248 vikram sanvatsar ke jyaistha kii krishnashashthee somvaasar ko rana motishwara ke marannimitt gohilavansheey raji naamak raji ne satidharm kaa paalan kiya tha
 Rana Motishwara's death anniversary was also called his son named Vijayaraja
 This is mentioned in other inscriptions
 motishwara or vijayraj ke saath saath anek hutatmaon ke naam shilalekho main uttankich kiye gayi milte hai
 According to the said date, the inscription was produced on the fourth day of May-month of 1192 years
 atah us dinank se purv hi kisi yuddh main un veeron kii mrityu hui thi ye siddh hota he
 Another inscription has also been found from a place called Goth Mangalod
 vah shilaalekh bhi ukt tithi ko hi uttankit kiya gaya tha
 According to that inscription many rajnis became sati after Jaisingh's heroism
 bajalu naamak sthal se ke sameep main) praapt 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke baishakhmas ke shuklachaturdashi ko somvaasar ke din kisi parmarpramukh ke hutatma ho jane se uski rajniyaan sati hui thi
 One can reconcile the dates on the basis of various perspectives and other inscriptions
 ukt pramaanon se siddh hota he ki, 1192 varsh ke may-maas kii chauthi dinank se purv ghori ne narin yuddh main vijay paa lee thi
 He then took possession of Ajayameru
 farsigranthon, bhartiyagranthon or bharatiyashilalekhon ke avlamban se nishchit hota he ki, yuddh kaa samgr ghatnakram 1192 varsh ke farvari-maas kii aththaravin dinank se 1192 varsh ke april-maas kii sattaaise dinank tak hua tha
 The study of Rajavali written in 1685 Vikram Samvatsar has also proved to be important for knowing the actual date of the war of Narayan
 sarvapratham baar 1953 varsh main jainsaahityacharya agarchand nahata ne us rajavali ko prakashit kiya tha
 In 1953, the book was published in Dr
 Dashrath Sharma's book titled 'kalevar of Unknown Mother Indraprastha Prabandha'
 vanshavali main likhaa he ki, 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke chaitramas kii krishnadvithiya tithi ko prithviraj ke sahabandhu visalpal ke putr divakar ko bandi banaakar tejpal ne dehali par aadhipaty sthapit kar liya
 1249 On the brightest date of Chaitramas of Vikram Samvatsar, Ghori defeated Tejpal and took over Delhi
 ukt pramaanon se siddhya hota he ki, 17 march dinank se purv dehali kaa patan nahin hua tha or 17 march dinank se purv prithviraj hutatma hue the
 Evidence of Ghori's military activity within the Narayan war is also available
 tajul masir naamak pustak main hasan nijaami ne ullikhit kiya he ki, narinyuddh ke pashchaat ghori sarvapratham ajayameru -prasaad pahunchaa, tatpashchaat usne dehali ko jita
 Hasan Nizami's statement also supports a book called 'lubb Tawarikhe Hind'
 rajavali ke anusaar 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke chaitramas kii krishnadvithiya tith ko tejpal narinyuddh se palaayan kar dehali bhaag gaya tha
 According to Anglapanchang, 1192 was the third date of the month of March-year
 narin ke yuddh tritiy prahar main purna ho chukaa tha
 Historians are of the opinion that Prithviraj may have been made a point by Turksaniko, probably at three o'clock or four o'clock
 tejpal usee samay yudhakshetra se palaayan kar dehali chalaa gaya hoga
 Eighty km from the battlefield of Tejpal Narayan to Dehli
 kii drutatar gati se gaya ho, tab bhi uski yatra do din main samaapt hui hogi
 In this way, the battle of Narayan must have been completed on the first day of March-month of 1192 year on Ravivasar
 bhartiyapanchang ke anusaar us din holikaa parv tha
 The battlefield of Narayan was created with the blood of Hindus on the full moon date of falgun-mass of 1249 Vikram Samvatsar
 sriharihar nivas dwivedi ke matanusaar narinyuddh ke pashchaat kii sambhavit tithi nimna ho sakati hai
 • March 1 - The end of the Narayan war • 5 march – ghori dwaara prithviraj ko ajayameru le janaa
 • March 11 - Prithviraj's demise
 • 13 march – govind ne ajayameru kaa samrajya samarpit kar diya
 • 17 March - Fall of Silli prithviraj ne 1190 varsh main ghori ko narineshetra main parajeet kiya tha
 Thereafter, Ghori increased his military power during the one-year exercise
 duusari ore prithviraj ek varsh tak bhartiya raajnneeti kshetra main vyast rahe
 He also fought many wars that year
 1190 varsh main bharat kii jo rajnatik prishthbhumi khee, vah prishthbhumi ek varsh main vipareet ho chuki thi
 The undercurrents of Rajputs had become huge
 uttarabhartiya raja satat paraspar yudhya karne main vyast the
 Ghori took advantage of the mutual struggle between the Rajput kings and Prithviraj was again attacked
 narin ke yudhakshetra main ghori ko "kisi bhi prakaaran vijay praapt karne ke liye sajj tha"
 On the other hand, Prithviraj did not have any military prowess
 ghori jaanata tha ki, prithviraj kaa sainysamarthy kitna he or prithviraj kii yuddh ke liye sajjataa nahin he
 a description of Prithviraj's war related inefficiency is received by Hammirmahakaavya
 hammirmahakavy main ullikhit kiya gaya he ki, prithviraj ke senapati udayraj apni sena ke yuddh kshetra main vilamb se pahunche
 Prithviraj's prince could not even participate in the Narayan war
 kyonki vah anya yuddh main rat tha
 Such descriptions are also found in the 17 verses of the book called Virudhvidhyavidhyavansha
 prithviraj ke liye yuddh main vilamb ho ye atyaavashyak tha, parantu ghori prithviraj kii durbalata kaa laabh lekar yuddh karne ko tatpar ho gaya
 Ghori and his officers were adorned for the war by speculating a lot about the war plan
 ve kab ?, kahan ? or kaise ? prithviraj kii sena par akraman karenge iskaa sab chintan unke dwaara ho chukaa tha narineshetra main ghori ke paas jo sena thi, vah chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt thi
 Soldiers of that army were adorned with unarmed weapons and unarmed horses
 chora vibhaagon main vibhakt vah sena chaaron dishaao main bhartiya sena ke upar akraman karne ke liye sajj thi
 In addition to the army which was divided into four divisions, a team of 10,000 soldiers was composed by Ghori
 wein 10,000 sainik ashv par arurh hote hue bhi baan chalaane main samarth the
 He was ordered by Ghori to fight against enemies from left, south, front and back
 aage ghori dwaara aadesh diya gaya tha ki, yada bhartiya sena ke ashwarohi, padaati or hathi akraman ke liye aage aayen, tabawein peeche jaakar apane or shatru ke madhya ek ashv daud sake utana antar rakkhen
 This policy of Ghori was meant to create confusion among the Bharti soldiers
 ukt niti se yadi turksainik yudhakshetra main aacharan karte hai, tarhi bhartiya sainikon main bhram hota he ki, turksena te sabhi sainik yudhakshetra main hai
 Different projects of Ghori's strategy are found in different books
 yatha yahiya sarhindi naamak pustak main ullekh he ki, yada hindooon ke hathi or ashv arohinh turksena ke kisi dalsy ke upar akraman karte, tarhi anya dal teenon disha se akraman karte the
 In the book of Isami, it is also mentioned, that Ghori's contemplation of the first war of Narayan was that Turkic horses were afraid in the presence of Indian celebrities, so in the second war we have to mainly attack the elephant
 iske liye ghori dwaara abak ke saath milakar gazani pradesh main ashv bhi prashikshit kiye gayi the
 With the said military plan, Ghori spent the entire night in military decorations
 duusari ore prithviraj kii sena sampoorn raatri gahan nidra ke adheen thi
 At Brahmamuhurta, Ghori's army was ready to attack Prithviraj's camp from all around
 jis samay prithviraj ke sainik nidradhin the, usee samay ghori ne akraman kar diya
 Prithviraj himself was engrossed in sleep at the beginning of the war
 kuch sainik dainik kaaryon main vyast the
 In the year 998, as in the battle of lamgan, it was also in the war of Narayan
 supt rajput sena ke upari kavachadhari, sashastrasainik or ashwarohi kaa akraman ho gaya
 More than Chalice Sahasra Turksmen invaded Prithviraj's army accidentally
 jab tak paryantan sabhi sajj hote, tab tak to pralay sadrush sthiti ho gai thi
 Many Rajput soldiers had died in the battlefield itself
 prithviraj kaa adhik sanybal us akraman main hi vinasht ho chaka tha
 Historians believe that Narayan's Second War was not an actual war, but an accident
 us yuddh main na to hathion yaa ashwon kaa yuddh main upyog hua, na to koi rajputsainik yuddh kar paaya
 Surprised, all the mortals went to Yamlok, suffering from anguish
 adhiktam sainik snaan bhi nahin kar paye, kuch ashv ke sameep bhi nahin pahunch sake, yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke pehle hi anek rajput sainikon kii hatya ho gai
 In that attack, the invaders were in good shape, because they had determined the time and place of the attack
 ghori kii kendriya sena kaa netritv vah swayan kar rahaa tha
 On his left was a commander named Ilah and in the south was a commander named Mukalba
 agrim dal kaa netritv kharbak naamak yoddha kar rahaa tha
 a warrior named Kharmel was employed with his army at the back of Ghori
 qutubuddin abak sabhi vibhaagon kaa netritv kar rahaa tha
 He always lived near Ghori
 us samay ghori kii sena main 1,03,000 ashwarohi the
 Each soldier of Ghori's army was equipped with armor called 'jihar'
 ghori kii arakshit sena main 12,000 akramak yoddha the
 They were also adorned with armor called 'jihar', crown of loh and with assi, bow and shul
 turk sainiko ke aakasmik akraman se prithviraj kii sena chhin-vicchhinn ho gai
 No one was able to lead the soldiers
 us samay dehali ke govind raay naamak pradhan senapati ne rajputon kii sena kaa netritv kiya
 He gathered his army and started a war against the Ottoman army
 govind raay yada yuddh kaa netritv kar rahaa tha, takinya senadhyaksh bhi usase judane lage
 Pithora was led by the Central Army
 govindaray ke vam bhaag kii sena ke adhyaksh padamsha rawal or dakshin bhaag kii sena ke adhyaksh bhuvanakamall naamak senapati nijasena ke sainikon kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Govand Rai along with the elephantine attacked the advance team of Khabarak
 khabarak ne kisi prakaar apni raksha kii
 He then ordered his soldiers to "attack only the elephants with their arrows"
 khabarak ke aadesh anusaar turksainikon ne hathion aup mahavaton par akraman kar diya
 54 Chauvan elephants of the elephant army were hurt by the arrows of the Ottoman soldiers
 jis se bhartiya sena ke hathi itastatah hoge
 After this, according to the description of Isami, Hindusena turned towards defeat
 farista main ullikhit he ki, ghori ke aadesh anusaar uski sena chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt thi
 Ghori's order was that all the divisions should not fight with the Hindusena, but to wage war
 "yada hindooon kii hastisena yavansena par vijayonmukhi ho, tabasainik yudhakshetra se palaayan kar jaaen
 After that, the Rajput soldiers will come after you, reach the proper place away from the battle field and attack the Yavan Sainik Hindusena
 kisi bhi prakaar sabhi hindoosainikon kaa naash karnaa he" ye bhi ghori kaa aadesh tha
 According to the orders of Yavasena Ghori, he started fighting with Brahmamuhut till midnight, but the possibility of defeat of Hindusena was not visible
 madhyahn main ghori ne yada anubhav kiya ki, hindoosena ke saath yuddh main abhi bhi vijay kii sthiti nahin he, tabausane arakshit sena ko akraman kaa aadesh diya
 12,000 reserved armymen attacked Hindusena by accidental manner
 vah akraman atibhayankar tha
 Many Hindus were killed in that attack
 yuddh se purv sapadalaksh samrajya ke upar chaaron or se akraman karke simavarti rajyon kaa deshadroh ke shadyantra ke parinaam swaroop prithviraj kii sena anek vibhaago main vibhakt ho gai thi
 Thereafter, on the day of the battle, many Hindus were killed by the invasion of Prithviraj's war Shibir by Ghori's army in Brahmamuhurta
 na keval bharat ke anek rajpariwaar prithviraj ke viruddh shadyantra kar chuke the, api tu prithviraj kii sena ke anek padaadhikari bhi yavan sena ke shadyantra main sammilit ho chuke the
 Prithviraj was also imprisoned due to the betrayal of the near by Prithviraj
 ukt kathan kaa samarthan hasan nijaami, isami, nayachandsuri ityadi lekhak bhi karte hai
 The details of the war are found in detail in his books
 yada yuddh paraakaashtha par tha or govind raay apane hathisena ke prabhaav se turksena ke upar vijayonmukh tha, tabaprithviraj hindoosena ke or ghori yavansena ke kendriya vibhaag kaa netritv kar rahe the
 At the same time, Kharmel ordered his archery soldiers to "attack the arms of Hindusena"
 tatpashchaat yavan sainikon ne purnabal se hindoosena ke hathion par akraman kar diya
 Afraid of Banavarsha elephants started fleeing immediately
 us updrav main kharmel ke aadesh se yavansainikon dwaara daudte hue hathion ke peeche dundubhi aadi se gambheer dhwani utpann kii gai
 There were two incidents in the state of disarray in Hindusena
 sab se pratham to jis hathi par arurh hokar prithviraj yudhya kar rahe the, vah hathi baanon se aahat hokar aniyantrit ho gaya
 So Prithviraj came down from the hurt elephant and ordered his confidant to bring the horse
 dwitiya hua ye ki, ghori ne hindoosena main astavyastata kii sthiti ko dekhakar vambhag or dakshinbhaag se akraman karne ke liye apane sainikon ko aadesh diya or 12,000 arakshit sainikon ko bhi akraman kaa aadesh de diya vah swayan kendriya sena ke saath aage aa gaya
 The horse on which Prithviraj sowed ascension after getting down from the hurt elephant was the horse of the ashwa theater
 ghori ke saath deshadrohion kaa shadyantra yudhakshetra main bahudhaa safal hua
 When Prithviraj mounted on the horse, Ghori's soldiers started playing Bheri the second moment
 bheri kaa sangit sunakar prithviraj kaa ashv nrity karne laga
 Prithviraj knows what has happened after seeing the condition of the horse
 What else will happen ?
 ve sheeghra hi us ashv se utar gayi or hindu padaation ke saath milakar yuddh karne lage
 At the same time, a Turksician from behind hit the cervix of Prithviraj
 tatpashchaat turksainikon ne milakar prithviraj ke upar akraman karke prithviraj ko bandi bana liya 
 On the first day of March-11 of the year 1192, the Hindus were weary of casual attacks, Bubuksha, Pipasa and conspiracies were defeated in the war
 us din 36 rajwanshon ke asankhya virasainik ne apni mathrubhumi kii raksha ke liye apane pranahuti de di
 Many children were orphans and many women became widows
 sapadalaksh samrajya ke patan se kannauj pradesh ke raja jayachand ne ghrit ke deepak jalaakar utsav manaaya
 After conquering Narayan's war, Ghori reached ajayemaru-prasad with Prithviraj
 nagar main pravesh ke anukshan hi turksainikon ne nagar main utpaat armbh kar diya
 Temples, idols and schools were looted and destroyed
 nagar janon kaa dhan or amoolyavastuon kaa bal purvak apharan yavansainik dwaara kiya gaya
 They start raping Hindu women, women and widows
 nagar main mahila, balak, vruddh or purushon ke aartnaad gunjan rahe the 
 There is an organization called 'sardool Research Institute' in Bikaner

 There is a famous class in those manuscripts, {{cquote|din palatu-palatu na man, bhuj vaahat sab shastr

 Life, death, day, night, happiness, sorrow, victory, defeat, rise and fall are according to destiny
 prithviraj raso kavy ke anek ansh chandabaradaayi ne kii rachana nahin he ye anek vidwaanon pramanit kiya he
 Prithviraj Raso is described in poetry in Gajni region, Prithviraj killed Ghori with an arrow
 jiske viruddh aneke itihasvidon main matbhed he
 After Ghori's slaying, Chand and Prithviraj killed themselves after killing each other, along with the mention that this information is mentioned by Chand
 kaai bhi vyakti apni mrityu kaa varnan kaise kar saktaa he? yahi sarvapratham prashn utpann hota he
 Thereafter, many proofs are obtained from the analysis of inscriptions etc

 Although it has been corrupted by Parvartin in the original source of Prithviraj Raso Kavya, yet the description of Banaveedha in Rasokavya does not prove to be completely unhistorical

 Ghosh of the said line is very popular in Indian public with many centuries and is still today

 How was Prithviraj's last period? There is enough evidence in Indian literature about this
 u pramaanon ke upasthaapan main prayek bhartiya strot kii paraspar bhinnata bhi he, parantu farsi-granth bhi vaise hi hai
 Among the medieval literature in which the mention of Prithviraj's death is received, Prithviraj Raso Kavya, Purana Prabandhanasagraha, Virudhidhavidhyavansa, Surajcharitamahakavya, Rajadarshini, kanhadde-prabandha, Prabandha Chintamaniha and Hammiramhakaavya are included
 farsi-sahitya main tajul masir, javaami ul hikaayta yaa rivaayat, tabakaate nasiri, phutuhussalatin, tarikhe farista, guldashne ibrahimi or aaine-akabari jaise granth pramukh hai
 Ghori took Prithviraj as a prisoner and took him to Ghazni region
 chandabaradaayi us yuddh main anupasthit tha, kyonki vah swayan prithviraj ke aadesh se jammu main hahuli hammir naamak samant ke saath sandhi karne ke liye gaya tha
 There, a feudatory named Hammir rejected the advice of Chandbaradayi and made Chandbardayi a point in the temple of Jalpa-devi
 yuddh ke samaapti ke pashchaat chand muktah hua
 Prithviraj is defeated and he is a prisoner of Ghori
 atah vah apane samrat ke uddhaar ke liye gazani pradesh gaya
 Chand impressed Ghori with his eloquence there
 tatpashchaat unase ghori kaha ki, prithviraj andh hote hue bhi kushaltya lakshya bhedane main samarth hai
 Thus inspired Ghori to see that miracle
 tatpashchaat chand varnan karte hai ki, ghori ko prithviraj ne ek hi baan se kis prakaar maar diya
 After Ghori's death, Prithviraj and Chand committed suicide
 chand ke anusaar uski or prithviraj kii mrityu gazani pradesh main hui thi
 The above story is available in the shortest, medium, and major three versions of Prithviraj Raso poetry
 puratanprabandhsangrah kaa rachanakaal 1290 vikram sanvatsar vartate
 Clerical AD 1428 - 1471 is considered
 puratanprabandhsangrah ke "prithvirajprabandh" main ullikhit he ki, raja kii greeva main bhaar sthapit karke ghori ne suvarna kii shrinkhala se prithviraj ko bandi bana liya
 He then took Prithviraj to Yoginipur
 dehali ke rajaprasaad main ghori ne prithviraj ko puchha, "he rajan! yadi main tumko jeevandaan duun, to aap kya karoge?"
 Prithviraj replied, "I gave you life seven times, will you leave me even once?"
 jiske nayanbudbudein nikaal diye gayi the, aise prithviraj ghori ke sammukh khedmagn ho gayi
 Then the prince of Prithviraj asked, Dev! What should be done This circuit is determined by destiny
 prithviraj bole, "yadi tum mujhe dhanushkand dete ho, to main isko maar saktaa hoon"
 Pradhan asked, Maharaj! Evave Karotu
 tatpashchaat vah pradhan ne ghori ke sameep jaakar kaha ki, is sthaan par na baitho
 So Ghori installed iron hull in his place and after that the head bowed to Prithviraj
 prithviraj ne apane baan ke aghat se lohputtal ke do bhaag kar diye
 Then he gave up Dhanushkand
 parantu lohe kii dhwani sunakar ve samaj gayi ki, ve nishphal hue hai
 So he thought in his mind that my work was still incomplete, so someone else would kill me
 tatpashchaat ghori ne ek mahagart main prithviraj ko phenk diya or usne prithviraj ko pashano se maarane kaa aadesh de diya
 If his blood falls on the ground, it will be auspicious that he kept on talking again and again
 1246 vikram sanvatsar main yawanon ne pashaanon maar-maar kar prithviraj ke praan le liye
 The topic of Banvedh is also found here, but the description is different
 yahan ghori ke sthaan par uskaa puttal bhedan kaa vivaran praapt hota he
 The place here is not Ghazni Pradesh, but it is Dehli
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ne aatmghaat kiya, parantu jainacharya ke matanusaar yahan ek gart main pashaanon ke aghaton se prithviraj ke praan gayi
 Only the death of Prithviraj is mentioned in this story
 chandabaradaayi kii or ghori kii mrityu kaa varnan nahin praapt hota
 The creation of Chandrasekharkrit Surjancharitamahakavya is considered to be 1692 Vikram Samvatsar
 surjancharitamahakavy ke dashamsarg ke 120 wein shloke se 168 wein shloke paryant varnan miltaa he ki, digvijay abhiyaan ke antar prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi bana liya tha
 Twenty-one times Prithviraj made Ghori captive and then left, but he did Prithviraj
 ek yuddh main chal se prithviraj ko bandi bana kar ghori unako gazani pradesh le gaya
 There he blinded Prithviraj
 tatpashchaat prithviraj kaa mitra bhi gazani pradesh pahunchaa
 He inspired Prithviraj to retaliate
 prithviraj ne bolaa, mere paas sena nahin or netra bhi nahin hai
 How is revenge possible in such a situation? tab chandabaradaayi ne prithviraj ko shabdavedhvidya kaa samaran karavaaya or prithviraj pratishodh ke liye sajj ho gayi
 Chandrabardiyi went to the assembly of Ghori, planning a rhetoric with Prithviraj
 swalp hi dinon main chandabaradaayi ghori or uske mantrion kaa vishwasabhak ban gaya
 Then one day Chandbaradiyi said in the meeting, Prithviraj is able to pierce the chains of iron even in the dark
 unke us kaushal ko ekwar to darshana hi chaiye
 Ghori agreed to see Prithviraj's skills after Chandbaradiyi asked
 tatpashchaat rajaprasaad main ek stambh par suvarnashrinkhala baandhakar yavansainikon ne prithviraj ke haath main dhanushkand diye
 Chandbaradiyi said to Ghori that, you yourself command Prithviraj three times to shoot the arrow, only after that he will do thundering
 is prakaar ghori te mukh se shabd nikalne ke anukshan hi prithviraj ne baan chalaa diya
 He gave the distinction of Baan Ghori
 atah tatkshan hi ghori kii mrityu ho gai
 The killing of Ghori led to the situation of Kautuhal in the Rajprasad
 atah chandabaradaayi ne prithviraj ko ashv par chadhaaya or jangaldesh le gaya
 There, Prithviraj ruled the kingdom according to his fame and went to heaven
 surjancharitamahakavy kii katha prithviraj raso kavy ke saath anek anshon main samanjasy dhaaran karti he
 There is a difference that here, Prithviraj along with Chandbaradiyi succeed in getting out of the Ghazni region
 tatpashchaat ve jangalapradesh main rajya karke paralok jate hai
 Prithviraj Raso, a Surjnacharitha Mahakavikar, does not even completely oppose and oppose poetry
 is prakaar surjancharitamahakavy main keval ghori kii hatya kaa hi varnan praapt hota he
 Prabandhchintamana was composed on the full moon date of Vaishakhamas of 1361 Vikram Samvatsar
 is granth ke rachanaakaar merutung hai
 It is mentioned in the Prabandhchintamani that the son of Mlechharaj attacked Prithviraj, the ruler of the kingdom of Sapadalaksha, in order to save his father from insulting him
 ghori ne purnsajjataa ke saath prithviraj ke rajya par akraman kar diya
 But fearing the arrogance of archers of Prithviraj's army, Ghori ran away with his army
 prithviraj ne ghori kaa peechha kiya
 On the way, some officer of the food department said to Prithviraj, o Rajan! Please donate seven hundred camels
 uskaa vachan sunakar prithviraj ne pratyuttar diya ki, sarvapratham mlechhraj ko markar uske ooton ko apane adheen karuunga, tatpashchaat tumhaari ichhaapoorti hogi
 Then the king was determined to try further, so a prince named Someshwar told Prithviraj not to go after Mlechraj
 someshwar ke vachanon se cruddh prithviraj ne uske kaan kaat liye
 Someshwar, defeated by Prithviraj, became active in favor of Mlechraj
 someshwar ne ghori ke saath dirghakaal tak yojana banaakar uskaa vishwasarjan kiya
 He continues to give Ghori the confidence that he will win in front of Prithviraj
 tatpashchaat ghori ne ekadshi tithi ko prithviraj kii sena par akraman kar diya
 When the army of Mlechraja attacked the kingdom of Sapadalaksha, Prithviraj was in Ghadnidra after Parana
 ghori ke sainikon ne un par akraman kar unako bandi bana liya
 Prithviraj, who was made a prisoner by Ghori, lived in Ajmeru-prasada as a prisoner till Ekmas
 ek maas ke pashchaat ekadshi tithi par prithviraj jab poojamagn the, tab mlechhraj ne unako pakvamance khaane ke liye bheja
 Prithviraj was still worshiped at the time of meal, so his attention was not on the meat
 parantu bahukaal vyateet ho jane par ek kukkur prithviraj ke shibir main pravisht hua
 The cook ate that meat
 kukkur ko maance lekar ja rahaa dekh shibir ke pratihaari ne prithviraj ko puchha, kyon aapane bhojan kii raksha nahin kii?
 Prithviraj replied that, whose food was unable to carry even seven camels, such is the condition of his food
 ye sab main ananukool hokar dekh rahaa hoon
 After that a Pratihari asked Prithviraj with anger, is there still so much power left? Answering him, Prithviraj said, if i reach my place, then i should tell my physical strength
 prithviraj ke saath pratihaari kii jo charchaa hui, us charchaa ke samachar ghori ko bhi mili
 Enraged, he took Prithviraj to ajayameru-prasad
 usne prasaad ke rajsinghaasana par baithne ke liye prithviraj ko aadesh diya
 Thereafter, Ghori suffered from seeing the pictures around the throne
 rajsinghaasana ke chaaron or prithviraj ne mlecchon ko maarthe hue shukaron ke chitra prasthaapit kiye the
 Then, in anger, Ghori shook the Prithviraj, located on the throne from Parshu
 is merutungarachit mahakavy main prithviraj ke dehtyag kaa hi varnan praapt hota he
 This description is found when Prithviraj committed murder in Ajayameru region

 atah ajayameru ke mantri mahashreshtiramdev ne soochna prasaarit karwaai ki, "yavan jainstygh kii murtiyon kaa naash karen usase purv hi sabhi jainacharya murtiyon ko bhoomi main vailasthaan main sthapit karen"
 In this book, Ajmeru has been described as the place of death of Prithviraj

 The creation period of Hammarikavya is considered to be 1460 Vikram Samvatsar
 prithviraj ke antimkaal kaa varnan hammirkavy ke tritiyasarg main 53 wein shloke se 72 wein shloke paryant praapt hota he
 It is mentioned that, ghori ne pehle jitne bhi yuddh prithviraj ke saath kiye the, un yudhon kaa samaran karte hue ghor ne prithviraj ko dekha or sochane laga ki, "jaise mrigon se singh ajey hota he, vaise hi ye hamaare liye ajey hai"
 So at night, Ghori sent his confidants to Prithviraj's ashwala
 jinhone ashwadhipati ko or tooryavadak ko utkoch ke rup main aseemit suvarnamudra di
 Even in the last night of the night, the soldiers of Prithviraj attacked the soldiers
 anek utpatjanak ghoshon se yanvasainikon ne hindoosainikon par akraman kar diya
 Seeing the status of the sangram, Bharteshwar mounted on the horse of the theater, sent by Prithviraj Ashwapalak
 us samay ashwaruji hue prithviraj ko dekhakar tooryavadak ne panavanak or gomukh jaise vaadyayantro kii dhwani se sangitaraagon ko bajaanaa armbh kiya
 Hearing the music, the horse of the Natyasala started dancing
 tatpashchaat ashv se utarkar prithviraj ne yavansainikon ke saath yuddh armbh kiya
 The fear of Prithviraj's enemies arose in his heart and thunder
 prithviraj ko chaaron ore se yavansainikon ne vaise gheraa tha, jaise sarp ke chaaron or pakshi hote hai
 Prithviraj started a war with many Yavanayanikas
 us samay ek yavansainik ne prishth bhaag se prithviraj kii greeva par rajju phenki
 After that, all the soldiers came together and attacked Prithviraj
 deergh kaal tak sangharsh karke ant main prithviraj yavansainikon dwaara bandi hue
 Prithviraj's interest in his life and food disappeared after his arrest
 kisine mlechhadhipati ko nivedan kiya ki, "bharateshwar prithviraj ne tuje anek baar chhod diya tha, kya tum unhen ekbar bhi nahin chhodoge?"
 Hearing that person's words, Kudd Ghori said, "that is why these Hindus are inferior to political secrets"
 tatpashchaat ghori ne prithviraj ko anya durg ke karagaar main bhej diya
 Krur Yavan blinded Prithviraj in prison
 tatpashchaat shivamtanuai jise shiv kehete hai, baudhdhamtanuai jise sugat kehete hai, jainamtanuai jise sarvajyata kehete he, us adbhut chinmay brahm ke swaroop kaa samaran karte hue bharateshwar prithviraj shivdham gayi
 Lakshmidhar is the author of the Virudhvidhi Vidhyavansakavya

 Vamana was the grandfather of Lakshmidhar, the creator of Virudhvidhyavidhyavansa

 Sodh had two sons
 skanda or vaaman
 Skanda and Vamana were members of Prithviraj's cabinet
 skanda senapati tha or vaaman sandhivigrahakarta
 Lakshmidhar, the Vamana's protagonist in Virudhvidhyavidhyavansa, writes that, when Ghori had the first Narayan war with Prithviraj, Skanda gave an extraordinary performance
 dwitiyayuddh main jab prithviraj parajeet hue, tab sindhivigrahakarta vaaman ne ajmeru ke rajkosh se 2,002,000 dramm-mudraaen chori kar lee or bhaag gaya
 In the antithesis method, Lakshmidhar wrote that, vyapaditasturushkaih sah raja jivanmrito yudhih

 That is, the commander Skanda went to battle elsewhere
 us samay jis raja kii buddhi nidradi vyasano se avaruddh ho gai thi, vah jivit hote hue bhi mritvat raja turushkasainikon ke dwaara maaraa gaya 
 'kanhad de Prabandh' is Padmanabha, the author of poetry
 i
 1455 main is kavy kii prastuti hui thi
 Padmanabha was a Brahmin of the Visalanagara-sect
 ye padmanabh jalaur pradesh ke shaasha kanhadadev ke paanchaven vanshaj akhairaj ke raajakavi the
 By the order of Akhairaj, he composed a poem called "kanhad de Prabandha"
 is kavy kii bhashaa 'gurjarrajasthani' hi
 The battle that took place in 1368 Vikram Samvatsar with the king of Jalore state, Kanhad de Chauhan, with King Alauddin Khalji of Dehli, is counted among the important and famous wars of history
 yadhyapi 'kanhad de chouhan' jaanata the ki, yavansainikon ne jalauradurg ke upar chaaron disha se akraman kiya he or vijay kaa koi bhi maarg shesh nahin he, tathaapi kulparampara ke rakshanarth 'kanhad de chouhan' ne apane putr viramdev ke saath durg se baahar nikalakar yuddh kiya
 Both of those father-son died outside Jalaurdurga
 allaudin khalji ke kanhad de chouhan ke saath jo yuddh kiya, uskaa kaaran "kanad de prabandh" naamak granth main prapya hota he
 Padmanabha mentions in his poem titled "kanhad de Prabandha" that Sitai, the daughter of Alauddin Khalji, loved Veeramdev
 vah viramdev ke saath hi vivaah karnaa chaahati thi
 But marriage with an alien woman was unfit for Viramdev
 kyonki vah sochataa tha ki, is prakaar vijaateey vivaah karne se purvajon kaa apmaan hoga
 Although Feroza knew why Veeram Dev was repeatedly rejecting his request, Feroza wrote letters to Veeram Dev several times
 firoza kaa kathan tha ki, main purvajanm main prithviraj kii padmavati naamak raji thi
 So we both love not only this birth, but also many births
 to kripaya mere pranaynivedan ko asweekaar na karen
 The following is what Firoja said to Veeramdev
 somesar ghar chaththibaar, prithviraj lidhau avatar

 i was horrified in that birth
 prithviraj rupi tumko vash main karne ke liye main gau hatya kii thi
 After removing the uterus of that cow, he had done his mechanical method on that uterus
 us tantrik vidhi se prithviraj to mere vasheebhoot ho gayi, parantu rajkaryon se vah vimukh ho gayi
 After that, when Mlechcharaja named Ghori killed Prithviraj's Ghaggaranandi's arrow, while sacrificing his Satidharma, i also gave up my body in Ayodhya
 'javaami ul hikaayat' granth kii rachana moulana nasruddin mohammad uphi ne kii thi
 AD 1211 is considered to be the creation of that book
 usne ullekh kiya he ki, jab donon senaayen ranangan main sameep pahuchin, tab donon senon ke sainikon dwaara shibiron kaka nirmaan kiya gaya
 But Ghori had already ordered his soldiers to collect many wood
 kyonki uski yojana thi ki, shibir ke sammukh ham agni ko prajvalit rakhkar shatruon ko bhramit karengen
 We will reach the enemy's backyard at night by another route
 tatpashchaat brahmamuhoort main hi upar akraman kar denge
 Ghori's plan was successful, and the soldier, who was situated in Shibir, remained seated on the night before Shibir
 jisase prithviraj ke sainikon ne sochaa ki, turksena saamne kii shibir main hi he
 Ghori, along with his soldiers, traveled to Puri night and reached the back of the 'cola' shibir
 tatpashchaat aksmaat hi ghori ne prithviraj kii sena ke upar akraman kar diya
 yavansanis killed many Hindusanis in that attack
 aksmaat akraman se anek sainikon kaa vadh dekhakar 'cola' sochaa ki, peeche jate hai
 But then the elephants of his army became uncontrolled and a situation of disturbance arose in the army
 phir cola ko ghori ne bandi bana liya
 The author of the book 'taj ul Masir' was Sadruddin bin Hasan Nizami Nashpuri
 yavan panchang ke anusaar is granth kii rachana hi
sa
 603-614 ke madhya hui thi
 Hasan Nizami is the only foreign writer to have narrated the Narayana war
 us granth main pratham narin yuddh ke anantar kaa varnan praapt hota he
 When Ghori worked hard to avenge his defeat
 phir yuddh hua or ant main 'islam' kii vijay hui
 More Hindus were slaughtered than Eklakh
 ajayameru raay ko bandi bana liya gaya, parantu tatpashchaat usko mukt kar diya gaya
 Ajayameru Rai was freed, but he had a grudge for the youth in his heart
 atah usne yojana armbh kar di
 When Ghori became aware of his conduct, he ordered the slaying of Ajayameru Raj
 tatpashchaat motiyon se jadit talwaar se ajayameru raay kaa shirishchhed kiya gaya
 By the order of Ghori, Ajaymeru Rai's head was sent to his son
 'tabakaate nasiri' granth kaa lekhak abu umr minhazuddin osman bin sirajuddin mohammad jujajani tha
 The creation of that book is believed to be AD 1259-60
 minhaj ne yuddh kaa varnan karte hue likhaa he ki, yadhyapi hindooon kii vishalsena thi, tathaapi yavansena se wo parajeet ho gai
 'allah' sided with Yavasena, due to which the army of Hindus was defeated

 But there he was imprisoned by the civilians
 phir use narak bhej diya gaya
 Govindarai of Dehli was also arrested and his head was presented to Ghori in front of him
 ghori ne us shir ke do khandit dant dekhakar jaan liya ki, yah gowndaray hi he
 Ghori left the capital of Sapradalakshmrajya and established his dominance over Hansi, Sarsi, Digar, etc

 Qutbuddin Aibak also expanded his suzerainty by attacking places like Meerut
 'miraate masudi' granth kaa lekhak abdur rahamaan chishti tha
 Prithviraj became 'abu Jalaah'
 ghori ne 'bait' sweekaar karne ke liye prithviraj ko baaran baar kaha
 But Prithviraj did not reject 'bait', then Ghori murdered him
 
 The author of the book 'futuhussalatin' was Isami
 pithorarai bandi hue, uske pashchaat ghori ke sammukh unako prastut kiya gaya
 Ghori ordered his coronation
 phutuhussataleen granth main keval itnaa hi varnanan praapt hota he
 But in it, description of the Kavachan called 'karva' and the names of the generals of Ghori are also obtained
 tarikhe farista granth kaa lekhak mohammad kasim hindu shah farista tha
 Angel was Iran-native

 His ancestors belonged to the 'hindu Shahia' dynasty of the border regions of Panjab region and Afghanisthan region
 farista ke purvajon dwaara kab 'islam' dharm kaa angikaar kiya gaya? ye praapt nahin hota
 But in the year 1582 AD, Angel went with her father to the Raj Bhavan of Murtaza Nizam Shah, the Nizam Shahi Sultan of Ahmednagar, Maharashtra
 tab vah baarah varshiya tha
 There, Farishta's father was appointed as a teacher
 farista bhi sena kaa ang ban gaya
 After that he became the President of the Guardian as soon as he was promoted
 farista 'shiya' naamak panth kaa yavan tha
 He did not have many friends in Ahmed-nagar
 atah vah ahamed-nagar ko chhodkar aajeevika ke liye bijapur chalaa gaya
 While living in Bijapur, he composed a book called Tawarikh by the order of Ibrahim shah-ii
 i
 1606 varsh main vah granth purna purna hua
 The book in which the description of the Narayan war is received is named 'gulshane-ibrahimi'
 vah granth 'tarikhe farista' ke naam se hi prasiddh he
 It is mentioned in the book that, Pithorarai Kichitta had gone away, when the Turksanis arrested him
 phir ghori ne uskaa vadh kar diya
 In the Akbari text, it is mentioned that in the end, the king was imprisoned in battle
 uske pashchaat ghori unako lekar gazani pradesh chalaa gaya
 Chandrabardayi also reached there to maintain his loyalty
 chandabaradaayi ne ghori kaa vishwasarjan karke uski seva main niyukt hua
 Chandbaradiyi learned about the work of Prithviraj by his efforts and by consoling with Prithviraj, he consoled Prithviraj
 chandabarayi ne prithviraj ko bolaa ki, "main ghori ke sammukh aapaki dhanurvidya kii prashansa karunga or use aapkaa kaushal dekhne ke liye sajj karunga
 At that time, you should kill him by chance "
 chandabaradaayi kii yojana kaa samarthan karte hue prithviraj dhanurvidyakaushal kaa pradarshan karne ke liye sajj ho gayi
 Then he killed Ghori with only one arrow
 ghori kii hatya dekhakar uske sainikon ne chandabaradaayi or prithviraj ke upar akraman kar diya
 In the end, they killed both of them
 bhartiyarot main jaise sabhi lekhakon kaa varnan bhinn he, vaise hi farsibhasha ke lekhakon kaa varnan bhi bhinn hi he
 Many writers in the Persian texts believe that Prithviraj died in the battlefield
 bhartiyalekhakon dwaara or farsi-lekhakon dwaara jo kuch bhi varnan apane granthon main upasthaapit kiya gaya he, us varnan kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya gaya or un kathanon ko teen bhaag main vibhakt kiya gaya
 Each author gives different details about the death of Narayana Yuddha, Prithviraj's death and Ghori's death
 bhartiyalekhak or farsilekhak apane varnananusaar teen vibhaag main vibhakt hai
 In the description of the Narayana war, which Indian writers and Persian writers have given various descriptions, those narratives are divided into three divisions
 narin yuddh kaa varnan karne vaale ek varg kaa can he ki, prithviraj bandi avasthaa main gazani pradesh main the
 Then his friend Chandbaradayi reached there
 un donon ke sammilit prayaason se ghori kii mrityu hui
 Then both of them committed suicide
 prithviraj raso kavy kaa kathanak yahi he
 The description of 'aine Akbari' is akin to Prithviraj Raso poetry, but in that poetry the writer has not given any description of the situation
 surjancharitamahakavy main prithviraj raso kavy ke sadrush varnan praapt hota he
 But there seems to be more segregation than Rasokavya
 surjancharit ke anusaar ghori ke vadh ke pashchaat chand or prithviraj gazani pradesh se sakushal palaayan karne main safal hue
 Then both of them died in Sapradalakshtra
 ek varg he jiskaa kathan he ki, prithviraj kii mrityu narin yuddh ke samay ranangan main hi gai thi
 Prominently in that category are the texts of Persian language 'tabakate Nasiri', 'futuhussalatin' and 'gulshane Ibrahimi'
 bhartiyarot main keval do granth hai
 Virudhvidhyavidhyavansa and ‘kanhad de Prabandha’
 narin ke yuddh main prithviraj ko bandi karke ghori unako ajayameru ke prasaad main le gaya, phir prithviraj ne ghori ke viruddh yojana banaai, jiskaa gyaan ghori ko ho gaya
 At that time, Ghori ordered the slaughter of Prithviraj, the texts in which these descriptions are found, are included in this class
 'tajul masir', 'jamiul hikaayat', 'miraate masudi' or 'jammu kii tawaarikh' ityadi farsigrantho main esa varnan praapt hota he
 In the Indian texts, the ancient epics, Prabandha Chintamani: The meaning of both these texts is the same, but according to the description of Jainatmanyayan Nayanchandasuri, Prithviraj gave up his life in a prison in Ajayameru
 vibhinn granthon ke varnan ke anugun siddh nahin hota ki, kiski mrityu ?, kahan ?, kaise ? or kab ? hui thi
 But only on the basis of the evidence can be proved, whose death ?, where ?, how? And when? It was then
 atah kram se ghori kii or prithviraj kii mrity ke pramaan kaa vishleshan kiya gaya
 Ghori did not die at the hands of Prithviraj in the Ghazni region, but fourteen years after the death of Prithviraj, there is evidence of Ghori's presence
 ghori kii mrityu hindooon ne hi kii thi
 Numerous evidences are found regarding Ghori's death
 'tajul masir' granth kaa lekhak hasan nijaami tha
 He mentions in his book that, after suppressing the hollows, Ghori had been living in India and going back to Ghazni region
 jab vah dhamek pradesh ke sameep pahunchaa, tab vahaan kumud or chamelichameli jaise pushpon se sugandhit udyaan main shibir banaai
 When Ghori was engaged in evening prayer, some people came there
 unhone rakshakon or karmakaron ko markar ghori kii hatya kar di
 The author of the book 'tarikhe Jahankush' was Alauddin Juwaini

 a group of 20 'gakkhad' people arrived there with the intention of killing Ghori

 So they were waiting for an opportunity to kill Ghori for a long time for vengeance
 us din umas bharaa vaataavaran tha
 Therefore, according to Ghori's order, the shibir covers were kept open by the soldiers, so that the airflow in the shibir remained uninterrupted
 phir ghori ke sevakon dwaara jab aavaran anaachhadit kiya gaya, tab hindooon ne us suavasar ko jaan liya
 The Hindu group then sat in hiding at some place near the army at night

 On 602 ', Ghori reached Barmhek-place situated on the banks of Sindusagar
 vahaan shibir ghori ne shibir banavaai
 Then Ghori was killed the other day
 vahaan 20 'gakkhad' logon kaa ek samooh ghori kii hatya ke uddesh se aa pahunchaa
 Because the relatives of those Hindus were killed by Ghori and made them homeless
 atah ve pratishodh kii kaamana se bahut samay se ghori kii hatya ke avasar kii pratikshaya main the
 Ghori was living here as a shibir, somehow the group reached there

 a Hindu attacked Shibir's gatekeeper with a knife and killed him

 Seeing the hurt state of the gatekeepers, other soldiers also appeared there

 At the same time Hindus entered Ghori's Shibir
 vahaan do teen sevak ghori ke sameep hi baithe the
 But seeing the weapon in the hands of Hindus, they remained silent
 ghori udhakar pratikriya de usase purv hi hindooon ne us par akraman kar diya
 Twenty-two very harsh attacks were made by those Hindus

 The author of the book 'tabkate Nasiri' was Qazi Minhaj
 usamen ullikhit he ki, ghori jab 'magarabi namaaj' kar rahaa tha, tab uski hatya hui 
 In the 'futuhuslatin' text, it is mentioned that, when Ghori was confined with the visitors, one of the visitors attacked Ghori with a sword
 talwaar ke ek hi aghat se ghori kii mrityu ho gai
 Ghori published two types of currencies in the Ghazni region
 suvarna kii or rajat kii
 The name of that currency was 'dirham'
 ghori kii anek mudraayen itihasvidon ko praapt hui he
 Only mentions of the currencies held in the Mansion, Prinsep Cabinet place are more mentioned

 Some say he was decorating for a military visit, some say he was engaged to visitors

 The essence of the opinion of various authors is that Ghori was killed by twenty people originating in a dynasty from among Hindus, Gakkhs, Mulhida, Fidaiyan, Khokhar, Ismaili, Karamata etc
 ukt itihaaskaar ke varnanon main kiskaa varnan satya he or kiskaa asaty? ye gyaan to pramaanon se hi praapt hota he
 Historians are of the opinion that a group of 20 people killed a king like Ghori in this matter
 lakhon sainikon ke vyuh main vidyaman ghori kii hatya hui, us par kisi sainik kaa dhyaan nahin tha ye varnan tarksangat nahin lagata
 But from the evidence obtained from the Persian texts, the time of Ghori's death is proved for twenty-four years after the war of Narayan

 There is evidence in the dhi-rajavali that Ghori ruled the Indian states till 1192 + 14 = 1206 AD
 phir sindhunadi ke tir par hindooon ke dwaara maaraa gaya 
 Combined currencies of Prithvirajatari and Ghori are available

 The joint publications of Prithvirajasya and Ghori were first published by the eminent numerologist named Edward Thomas
 unke kathananusaar unako vishwaas hi nahin tha ki, prithviraj kii ghori ke saath sanyuktamudra ho bhi sakati he
 Because of the defeat of Prithviraj in the Narayan war, Ghori took him to Ajayameru, then Ghori murdered him by giving him a physical anguish in prison
 atah sandehshil edward thoms ne general kaningham ko praapt mudraayen bataai
 General Cunningham read the existing letters in the obverse and back of that pose
 us samay general kaningham ke paas waisi hi mudraayen anuplabdh thim
 But the currencies given by Edward Thomas made available joint currencies
 general kaningham or edward thoms ke paas jaisi mudraayen thim, waisi hi mudraayen nelson rit ke paas bhi thim
 Although all three had joint currency of Prithviraj and Ghori, the weight of those postures was different
 1
 edward thoms dwaara sangruhit mudraayen :- bhaar - 36 gren, agrabhag – ashwarohi prithviraj, prishthbhag – nandi mahamad sam 
 2
 Mudra adopted by General Kanigham: - Vyas 55 ”, weight 55 grains, front part - Ashwarohi Prithviraj, back page - Nandi Mahmad Sama
 3
 nelson rit dwaara sangruhit mudraayen :- vyas 55”, bhaar 55 gren, ashwarohi prithviraj, prishthbhag – nandi mahamad sam Thoms, presenting the findings after studying the said Samudra Mudras, said that these postures were published by Govand, son of Prithviraj
 usne apni satta kii manyata ke liye apane pita tathaa tatkaaleen shaasha ghori ke naam se mudraayen prakashit kii 
 According to the conclusion of General Kunningham, Prithviraj was a feudal lord of Ghori till the time
 atah sanyuktamudraayen prakashit kii gai
 
 nelson rit ke nishkarsh anusaar prithviraj ke paraajay ke pashchaat ghori ne ajayameru par swadhipaty sthapit karnaa chaha
 Therefore, he himself published these postures
 kaningham or nelson ke nishkarsh ke saath swamat yojit kar kunvaradevi singh mandava bhi "ghori ne wein mudraayen prakaashik kii thi" aisa ullekh karti hai
 Kunvaradevi argues that Ghori must have published the Samudra Mudras to change the mood of the subjects and to spread the message "prithviraj is his subordinate king"
 usamen uskaa rajnatik laabh ye tha ki, "prithviraj ne ghori ke shashan ko angikaar kiya" ye sandesh kisi vidroh kii sthiti ko janm nahin degaa
 She further states that, as the currency was circulated in the name of mughal-king Shah Alam II by the 'east India Company' to gain the benefit of the subject's mind, it led to the belief in the rule of the Mughal Empire in the subjects
 
 vaise hi tab hua hoga 
 According to Dr
 Dasharatha Sharma, the combined money presented by Edward Thomas is the main reason that Ghori wanted to give power to Prithviraj as the feudal kingdom of Sapradalaksh
 dow dineshchandra ne apane ko mudra ke sandarbh main vaastavik nishkarsh kaa pramaan dene main asamarth bataaya parantu unhone mat diya ki wein mudraayen aadhikarik rup se rajkeey mudranalayon main nahin, api tu anya swaichhak santhaaon dwaara mudrita kii gai hongi
 In various texts, it is said that Prithviraj was killed in the battlefield of Narayan
 parantu aitihaasik prishthbhumi, yudhoddesh or ghatnakram ke aadhaar par yudhakshetra main prithviraj kii mrityu ke samband main nirnay apramanikat mana jaataa he
 Ghori's invasion of India had two main motives
 prapratham to bharat ke dhan kaa lunthan or apane dharm kaa vistaar
 Ghori's victory in the battle of Narayan fulfilled his first wish
 parantu prithviraj ke 'islam' dharm angikaran kaa uskaa dwitiya uddesh avshisht tha
 Therefore Prithviraj's life was inevitable
 ghori kii dwitiya ichha ke pramaan vibhinn granthon main prapya hai
 The book named tajul-masir mentions that, when Ghori reached Lahore with his army, he sent an envoy named Kawamulmulk Ruknuddin Hamza to Ajayemaru Prasad
 ghori ne sandesh bheja tha ki, tum apane kaanon main daastaa ke aabhushan pahan kar meri rajsabha main upasthit ho jaao or 'islam' dharm kaa angikaar karo
 It is mentioned in the angel that when Ghori reached Lahore, his trusted envoy, named Kavamulmulk Ruknuddin Hamza, sent him to Ajayemaru Prasad
 uske saath sandesh bheja tha ki, 'islam' dharm kaa angikaar karo
 It is further mentioned in the angel that Prithviraj was very angry after hearing the message from the messenger
 atah prithviraj ne apshabdon se 'islam' dharm re anuyaayi raja ko sambodhik kiya tha
 Returned the messenger with that message
 atah ghori kaa uddesh bharat vijay ke pashchaat prithviraj kaa yavanikaran tha
 For him, the life of Prithviraj was also mandatory
 yadhyapi narin yuddh kshetra main ghori chahta to prithviraj kii hatya kar saktaa tha, tathaapi vah prithviraj ko lekar ajayameru chalaa gaya
 Because he wanted ismali-karan of Prithviraj
 ghori kaa mukhya sainik abak tha
 After the Narayan war, he told the events of the entire war to two members of his Rajya Sabha

 He created his book according to the statement of Aibak, a direct observer of the Narayan war

 Khalik Ahmed Nizami established the essence
 nijaami ne likhaa he ki, ghori prithviraj ko ajayameru le gaya
 When Prithviraj then conspired against Ghori, Ghori killed Prithviraj as soon as he got the news
 tajul masir naamak granth main praapt vivaran kaa samarthan bhartiyarot bhi karte hai
 Hasan Nizami has also discussed some misdemeanors, but nothing is known about him
 us shadyantra ke falswaroop ghori ne prithviraj kii hatya kar di aisa uske dwaara ullikhi he
 Pro
 Esch Hodiwala in his book has written that, when Prithviraj's paramitra and assistant Udayaraja got news of Prithviraj's prison, he was saddened by self-aggression
 usne sochaa ki, yadi ksht sah rahe swami kaa tyaag kar palaayan kar jaaon, to meraa gaudvansh kalankit hoga
 Therefore, he attacked Delhi and attacked the fort of Delhi from all around
 us samay ghori kii sabha main kisi ne ghori ko kah ki, "in prithviraj ne tuje anek baar chod diya, kya tu ekbar bhi unako nahin chhodega?"
 Hearing that promise, Ghori said, "the kingdom will be destroyed in consultation with people like you
" phir ghori ne prithviraj ko ajayameru ke durg main bhej diya
 Pro
 According to Hodiwala's statement, the person who advised the liberation of Prithviraj was a person of Prithviraj
 apni chaaron ore anisht kii ashanka ke chalate ghori prithviraj ko ajayameru ke prasaad le gaya
 Thus, after the Ghori Narayan war, Prithviraj was taken from Delhi to Ajayemaru and killed Prithviraj there
 hasan nijaami ne jis shadyantra kaa varnan kiya he, us vishay main puratanprabandhsangrah naamak granth main ullekh praapt hota he
 It is mentioned there that, when Mlechharaj left Prithviraj, then Prithviraj planned for vengeance
 parantu unke vishwasghaatee mantri ne ghori ko yojana bataa di
 In Prabandhchintamani, composed by Merutung, one gets a description that Ghori was enraged at seeing the muggers killing the 'muslims' in the Chitrashala
 uske pashchaat usne prithviraj kaa shirishchhedan kar diya
 But in that description, the soundness is not considered
 kyonki ghori jaanata tha ki, na keval prithviraj, api tu chouhanvansh ke sabhi raja gaubhakshi muslimon se ghrinaa karte the
 Nizami has described that, Ghori took Prithviraj to Ajayameru and left him
 prabandhchintaman main bhi ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ajayameru ke rajsinghaasana par arurh hue
 According to the statement of Jainacharya named Jinprabha Suri, Ghori killed Prithviraj in Ajayameru
 11 / 3 / 1192 dinank ko prithviraj kii mrityu hui thi
 According to the Indian Panchang, Prithviraj died on the Krishna Ekadashi date of 1249 Vikramaswatsar's Chaitramas
 prithviraj kii mrityu kahan or kab hui thi iskaa vivaran vibhinn granthon main bhinn hi praapt hota he
 But Prithviraj died in Ajmeru 9, but he has tried to prove this scholar
 
 Ghori somehow wanted to force Prithviraj to accept 'islam' religion
 atah vah prithviraj ke saath sah raaj naitik sambandh sthapit karne ko tatpar tha
 But Prithviraj was determined to reject the 'islam' religion
 dow hemachandra raay likhte hai ki, "chouhan vanshiyon kaa itihaas or swabhimaan ko dekhakar prithviraj ke liye bandijiwan yaa dasjivan charitranukool nahin ho saktaa tha"
 Hence Prithviraj had two routes
 rajnatik vyaavhaarikta kaa upyog kar sandhi athwa swabhimaan kaa rakshan
 Prithviraj chose the second route
 prithviraj se nakaaratmak pratyuttar paakar ghori krodhagni main jal uthaa
 Therefore, he started torturing them physically and mentally to get Prithviraj to do his desired work
 ghori ke dwaara di gai maranantik peeda ko sahakar prithviraj uske vash main nahin hue
 Therefore, he conspired to diplomatically convince Prithviraj of 'islam' religion
 bahut varshon se ghori kii seva karanevaale deshadrohi mantri pratapsingh ko ghori ne prithviraj ke sameep bheja
 Pratapsingh's aim was to punish Prithviraj in any way for pursuing the 'islam' religion
 atah vah prithviraj ko kuch din paryant samajhaata rahaa
 Prithviraj believed in Pratap Singh and told him the agony of his mind and also told him the plan of Banvedh
 banvedh kii yojana ko hi nijaami naamak pustak main shadyantra ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Banvedh is confirmed in many texts and historical events also point towards it
 ghori ke aadesh par prithviraj ke mantri pratapsingh ne prithviraj ko 'islam' dharm kaa angikaar karne ke liye samajhaayaa
 Prithviraj said to Pratapsingh "I want to kill Ghori"
 prithviraj ne aage kaha ki, main shabdavedh baan chalaane ko sakasham hoon
 i am ready to demonstrate my knowledge
 tum kisi bhi prakaar ghori ko meri vidya kaa pradarshan dekhne ke liye tatpar karo
 After that, tell me where Ghori is located at the time of the performance of Shabdwedhaan in the Rajya Sabha
 main shabdavedhi baan se ghori kaa vadh kaaanpana pratishodh loonga
 But instead of helping Prithviraj, Pratapsingh informed Ghori with reference to Prithviraj's plan
 prithviraj kii yojana ke vishay main jab ghori ne suna, to uske man main krodh ke saath kautuhal bhi utpann hua
 He did not even imagine that any blind person could hear the sound and be able to penetrate the target
 parantu mantri ne jab baaran baar prithviraj kii nipunata ke vishay main kaha, tab ghori ne shabdavedh baan kaa pradarshan dekhnaa chaha
 Ghori had installed an iron or stone statue in his place
 tatpashchaat pratapsingh ne sabha main prithviraj ke haath main dhanushkand diye
 When Ghori ordered the target to be pierced, then Prithviraj fired an arrow
 us baan se us murti ke do bhaag ho gayi
 Due to the treason, Prithviraj's last attempt also failed
 hasan nijaami ke varnan anusaar, uske pashchaat krodhit ghori ne prithviraj kii hatya kar dene kaa aadesh diya
 After that, a Muslim soldier murdered Prithviraj from a Ratnagadit Suvarnayak Aasin

 After that, his orthodox rituals took place in Ajayameru's own Hariraj's lips

 Dr
 Bindhyaraja is of the opinion that Prithviraj often followed the said verse till his last time

 The Bharatiya Janata Paksha won in the elections held in India in 2014

 During the analysis of that victory, Ashok Singhal had said the above conclusion
 pruthvraj chouhan ke samay arthath 800 varsh pashchaat narendra modi pratham hindu shaasha hai
 Sher Singh Rana announced that he had brought back the bones of Prithviraj by going to Afghanistan
 kyonki prithvirajrasokavy main prithviraj kii mrityu gazani-pradesh main ullikhit he, atah anekon kii manyata he ki, vahiin prithviraj kaa samadhisthal he
 Sher Singh is also among those who follow that belief
 pehle ye phulannadevi kii hatya main dosha main tihaad karagaar main tha
 But after that, when he came to know that the tomb of Prithviraj is still in the Ghazni region and even today the Muslims insult his tomb, he escaped from the prison
 uske pashchaat vah kram se nepal, bangladesh or dubai hote hue kabul pahunchaa
 He took the ashes of Prithviraj from him and returned to India and surrendered
 yadhyapi itihasvidon ke matanusaar prithviraj kii mrityu ajayameru main hui thi or prithviraj ke anuj hariraj ne unki antyeshti vidhi kii thi, tathaapi prithviraj kii mrityu gazani-pradesh main hui thi ye bhi anekon kii dharna he
 According to that belief, the followers of Islam at Prithviraj's tomb were insulting Prithviraj, the last Hindu Hindu king of Hinduism
 shersingh ne 'jail diary – tihaad se kabul or kandhar tak' naamak apane pustak main apni yatra ke anubhav likhe hai
