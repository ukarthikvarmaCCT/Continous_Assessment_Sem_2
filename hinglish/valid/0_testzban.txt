 Forth was the center of William English Company in Bangalan
 sirajuddaula ne nawabi paane ke baad hi apane ek sambandhri salaaman jang ke viruddh sainik karrwai aarambh kii or purnia par akraman kiya
 On 20 May 1756, after reaching the palace, he changed his mind and returned to Murshidabad and took over the English factory at Qasim Bazar

 On 5 June, siraj-ud-daula's army left to attack Calcutta and reached Calcutta on 16 June
 19 june ko kalakatta ke governor, commander or cameti ke sadasyon ko nagar or durg chhodkar jahaaj main panaah lenaa padaa
 On 20 June, Calcutta was captured by the Nawab
 jab isaki khabar madras pahunchi to vahaan se sena bheji gai, jiskaa netritv clive ke haath main tha
 Clive Hooghly arrived in December

 He moved from the river towards Calcutta and took possession of it on 2 January 1757
 sirajuddaula ko jab isaki khabar mili to usne kalkatte kii ore badhane kaa praytn kiya magar asafal rahaa or sandhi karne par vivash hua
 The British benefited more from this treaty

 Meanwhile, a seven-year war started in Europe

 Here also a fight broke out between the British and the French

 The British started preparing to send their sea fleet there
 14 march 1757 ko chandranagar par akraman hua or ek hi din ke baad francisiyon ne hathiyaar daal die
 Watson attacked the French from the river side and Clive from the other side
 sirajuddaula is ladaai main khulkar bhaag na le sakaa
 Due to Abdali's invasion, he was probably not able to help the French and fight the British
 chandranagar kii ladaai ke baad clive ko gyaat hua ki sirajuddaula se uske apane hi aadmi asantusht hai; or unamem uskaa senapati mirajafar pramukh hai
 Clive determined to benefit from it
 falswaroop mirajafar or angrejon ke bich ek gupt samjhauta hua
 According to which the Kalivas promised to make Mirzafar civilized in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa
 iske liye mir jafar ko kalakatta main hue company kii haani or sainik vyay ke liye 10 lakh pound, kalkatte ke angrej nivaasiyon ko 2 lakh pound or arminian vyapaariyon ko 70 hajaar pound dene kii baat thahari
 Amichand, who had entered into an agreement between the British and Mirzafar, asked the Nawab for a commission of five percent of his treasury
 or is baat kaa ulalekh sandhipatr main kiye jane kaa aagrah kiya
 As a result Clive prepared two treatises
 ek asli doosraa nakli
 Amichand's terms were written in the fake treaty
 nakliwaale sandhipatr par angrej governor kaa hastakshar banaakar use dikhaaya gaya
 Mirzafar promised to remain neutral in the fight
 yah nishchay hua ki ladaai ke maidan main maujuud rahete hue bhi vah alag rahegaa
 The English army took action against Siraj-ud-daula under the leadership of Clnaive and resulted in the Battle of Plassey
 plasi main sirajuddaula kii haar hui or angrejon ne mirajafar ko bengal ko nawab bana diya
 Thus due to Clive the British became the masters of Bengal
 east india company ko 15 karod pound mili
 Clive was given 2 lakh 34 thousand pounds from it and Mirzafar also gave him a manor of thirty thousand pounds annually
 1759 main rajkumaar ali gauhar ne, jo aage chalakar shahalam ke naam se shaasha hua, dilli se bhagkar avadh main sharan lee
 He also wanted to capture Bihar and Bengal to increase his power

 The Nawab's representative Ramnarayan countered it until the British assistance arrived from Calcutta
 nawab ne choubees pargana kii bhoomi, jo is sahaayta ke liye rakh chodi gai thi, clive ko de di
 This amount was 30 thousand pounds which the company used to pay as rent
 1759 main dach logon ne mirajafar ke ladke se sajeesh kar angrejon ko bengal se nikaalane kii yojana banaai or falswaroop unhone saat jahaaj nagapattom se ravaanaa kiye ; magar jab ve hughali ke paas pahunche to nawab kii ore se unhen apni sena utaarne kii manaahi mili
 As a result, there were skirmishes between the Dutch and the British, in which the Dutch suffered loss of life and property

 At that time, Clive had a system of getting 3 million pounds a year

 He bought a large property and made his friends a member of the parliament
 1764 main phir clive ko bengal kaa governor banaakar bheja gaya or may, 1765 main clive dubaara kalakatta aayaa
 At this time he had two problems
 ek raajnneetik or duusari prashaskeey
 The political problem was related to the Mughal emperors, the Awadh state and the Nawav of Bengal
 prashaskeey samasya kan pani ke naukaron kii munafkhori kii thi
 Clive came to India to learn that the old governor, Vanciart, had promised to return the kingdom of Awadh to the Mughal emperor
 clive ne avadh ke nawab shujauddula ke paas is aashay k prastaav bheja ki yadi vah pachaas lakh rupe company ko dena sweekaar kare to elahabaad praant ko chhodkar uski riyasat use waapas kar di jaaegi
 Accordingly, Clive sought the Bengal Diwani in exchange for the Mughal emperor of Allahabad
 mughal badshaah ne farmaan jarikar bengal ke nawab ke adhikaar ko kam kar diya or company ko vah adhikaar de diya
 Before Clive arrived in India, the company's directors issued an order forbidding the company's servants to take gifts
 clive ne bengal pahunchate hi samast civil or faujee afasaron se ek dastavej par hastakshar karaae, jisase bhent lenaa nazaij ho gaya
 Arriving in Bengal, Clive saw that new people were working in many positions and they were making illegitimate profits
 clive ne vyapaar kii niti main parivartan kiya or usase jo laabh hua use company ke naukaron main baant diya
 He who opposed his policy removed him and brought others from Madras and replaced him
 bengal kii governri se pehle usne kan pani ke bhatte ke sambandh main nae kanoon banaae the magar ve kaaryvit na ho sake the
 Clive issued this law as soon as he reached Bengal
 is kanoon ke anusaar sainik afasaron ko bengal or bihar main usee samay bhatta mil saktaa tha jab ve chhavnee se baahar hon
 Only the officers residing in Munger and Patna centers were given an allowance
 is prakaar ek afasar ko teen, chah or baarah rupe prati din bhatta miltaa tha
 Like the civil officers, when the military officers also decided to resign from the job in protest against this law, Clive accepted his resignation and replaced him with an officer from Madras
 jo log vidroh par taiyaar hue unhen dabaa diya
 Meinjafar wrote 70,000 pounds for Clive in his will
 unako clive ne un logon ke naam kar diya jo yuddh main ghayal hue the
 In February 1767, Clive left India for the last time but before leaving, strengthened the lemon of the East India Company

 Literature, whether it is from any country or language, has always been indebted to its folklore and the art of mass democracy present in it
 apni mukhya preranaon ke liye aadhaar-saamagree vah shruti parampara se grahan karata he
 Even though the work of codification of social duties and responsibilities has been scholarly, but the work of observing, preserving and extending the country-longitude comes only as part of the people
 atah jis desh kaa loksahitya samrudh he vahaan samskruti or paramparaon ko bachaane-nikhaarane ke saath-saath nae gyaan ko aatmsaat karne main apekshaakrit kam samay lagata he
 The tradition of education in India is derived from the Gurukuls
 satya kii khoj ke liye na jane kitne nachiketao ne is desh main raaj-paat chode hai
 It is a different matter that the facility of methodical learning was earlier limited to specific sections of the society
 jiske dushprinamvash karn or eklavya jaise jigyaasuon kii gyaan kii talash antat abhipsa hi siddh hoti rahi he
 The importance of the art of mass communication for the education-deprived class was more than that of the rest of the society
 visheshkar saamanti daur main jab prakaashan kii duniya aaj jitani badi or samathryavan nahin thi, saamaajik sambandhon, vargeey jatilta ke chalate jansankhya ke bahulansh ko sansadhano se vanchit kar diya jaataa tha
 The art of mass media was then used to fulfill the entertainment-related needs of the general public, to carry the traditions of experience and knowledge to the next generation and to preserve them
 kaha ja saktaa he ki itihaas, parampara, vyavhaar, saanskrithik pratikon evam mithkon ko sangrahntiya banane tathaa unka anveshan-vishleshan karne ke liye bauddhikon ne ek ore jahaan shastray ganrathon kii rachana kii, vahiin unhen lokmanas tak pahunchane or janajivan kaa hissaa banane ke saath-saath lokranjan ke liye kissagoi kii kala kaa vikaas hua
 It is not possible to tell exactly when the story started and where
 keval anumaan hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In the early period of civilization, when man must have tried to exaggerate something about a unique object, creature or event, in some interesting manner and with the desire of Lokaranjan; Naturally, there must have been arrogance in the rest of the people about his saying
 parinamtah un anubhavon ke prati samuhik jigyaasa tathaa unako rochak andaaj main, baar-baar sune-kahe jane kii parampara kaa vikaas hua
 The proportion of imagination also increased progressively
 isi se loksahitya or kissagoi kii kala kaa vikaas hua
 Now the question arises, what is anecdote and anecdote? kahani kaa bada swaroop aisa jo apekshaakrit lambey samay tak chale, jiske kathanak main kai mode, charitron ke takaraav, bhaawanaaon ke utaar-chadhaav, maansik udwelan or vichaaron kaa sangharsh ho, vah kissa kii koti main aata he
 It is also known as Baat or Baqahi
 kissa ekal kathanak pradhan bhi ho saktaa he or bahukthankon kaa samucchy bhi
 Sometimes, many short stories filled with diverse gestures are wrapped around the main plot
 choti-choti kahaniyon ko gunfit kar bade kathanak kaa rup dene or unhen kissagoi main dhaalane kii parampara duniya ke praayah sabhi deshon main, na keval maujuud balki lokapriy bhi rahi he
 Their form also varied with time and circumstances
 kissago apni yogyata or kalpanaashakti ke dam par unhen or adhik rochak tathaa smaraneey banane ke liye aavashyaktaanusaar pherbadal karata rahata tha
 In bound words, anecdote is an art of visualization of imagination
 jisase ham sabhi kaa vaasta padataa rahata he
 Along with the mother's lullaby 


 when the child begins to recognize the meaning of the words, probably since
 kissagoi ko lekar bachapan se shuru hua sammohan tajindagi kam nahin hota
 It contains the melody of imagination
 aisa laalitya samahit hota jisamen aakhar bolne lagate hai
 Words are spoken
 arth swayan mukhar ho uthte hai
 Despite being fictional, his description is so authentic, rhymed and lively that the audience gets carried away
 lekhan ke sandarbh main yah ek vishisht style he
 In which the narrator is in a state of address with his reader
 likhane ke bajaae vah kahani ko kahata he
 The story also adds to the creativity of the story
 jisase rachana main naad saundarya swaabhaavik rup se utar aata he or uski grahyata bad jaati he
 As a result, the reader and listener experience more pleasure and fulfillment
 lokparampara main maanya kissagoi hi shastray bhashaa aakhyaan ban jaati he
 Stories and stories have been very important in mass culture
 praayah samaaj ke bade-boode hi kissago kii jimmedaari ko sambhalate the
 Sometimes this art also became the basis of people's livelihood
 acchhee kahani ke saath sunaane kii behtareen kala sone par suhaage kaa kaam karti he
 There have also been talented stories that, without any prior preparation, just on the strength of their imagination, used to start telling a sutra and talk / misleading would take the form of an increasingly funny story or anecdote
 paaramparik gramin jivan main naitik evam saamaajik chetana itani pragadh thi ki vyaktimaatra unase vichlan ke khataron ko na keval pahachaanata tha, balki yathasambhav usase dur rahane kaa prayaas bhi karata tha
 It did not require any external undertaking like literature to make him aware of moral and social values; As it is felt today
 tab yah kaary dharm evam lokachar se jude vividh madhyamon dwaara sampann hota tha
 In other words, social values were developed along with the mind in the rural life devoted to co-operation and coexistence, and there was hardly any duality between them
 nishchay hi jansanvaadan kii kala jiskaa ek rup kissagoi bhi he, kaa isamen bahut bada yogadan tha
 And among the redundancy of the media, there is less, but it remains the same today
 chepal samskruti krishi samaajon kii pahchaan rahi he
 It was mandatory to have a chapel in every village
 yahi nahin chepal ke kshetraphal uske nirmaan main prayukt saamagree, vaastu-shilp aadi se gaanv-bhar ke maan-maryaada kaa nirdhaaran hota tha
 The art of kissing flourished on these chapals
 lekin kissago ke liye jaruri nahin tha ki apni hunarpeshi ke liye chepal ko hi chune
 In the summer the cattle grazing under the trees, enjoying the raindrops under the open sky in the rainy, warming the bonfires at the village's crossings, in the winter, spent the night in the hut-scarred huts, the stories continued unabated
 Were
 kissagoi ke prati anuraag samaaj ke kisi khaas varg yaa samudaay tak simit nahin tha
 Rather, almost all sections of society took interest in it
 kuch logon kii jeevika to raja-maharaajaaon ko kissa sunaane se hi chalati thi
 There is also some evidence that in the old times there were some such skilled people in the court of the emperor; Who used to tell stories to him and his princess only
 safal kissago ko apni jeevika ke liye bhatakana nahin padataa tha
 Folk spirit devoted to coexistence and non-existence used to have some stronghold to meet its needs
 aasapaas ke gaanvon se unke liye bulaave aate hi rahete
 During Thalwar, Daksha Kisago used to visit remote villages
 kisi meley, parv-tyohaar athwa vivaahadi ke avasar par aise kalakaar jab kahin pahunchate to vahaan dhooma much jaati thi
 After a day's work, people started gathering with them to share their experiences and joys and sorrows
 jahaan mausam, vibhinn saamaajik sthitiyon par vichaar-vimarsh ke alaava, manoranjan kaa khyaal bhi rakhaa jaataa tha
 In which both prose and verse forms found place
 padya rachanaaon main dhola-maaru, aalha, ramayana aadi pramukh thim to gadhy main mukhyatah kisse sune-sunaae jate the
 Among which alif-laila, Kissa parrot-maina, Sahasra Rajanititra, Dastane Char Darvesh, Throne Batisi, Vaital Pachisi, Kathasaritsagar, Jataka stories etc
 were prominent
 ye kisse jansamanya main behad lokapriy the tathaa bhinn-bhinn roopon main bina unke mul strot ko jane, sune-sunaae jate the
 Not only this, in order to maintain interestingness and attraction according to the occasion, Kissago was also free to change his interest and interest in him
 kuch kisse gadhy tathaa padya donon hi rup main prrrachlit the tathaa yah kissago-kalakaar kii yogyata tathaa shrotaaon kii pasand par nirbhar karata tha ki vah prastutikaran ke liye kis vidha kaa chayan karte hai
 The plot was often well known to the audience
 unki moulikta ke prati kissago kaa koi daawa bhi nahin hota tha
 The style of presentation of the story was original
 ucch kalpanaashakti, moulik style, dilkash sampreshan or paatro kii andruni jaddojahad ko ubhaarne main safal kalakaar hi janamanas ko apane jaadui prabhaav main laane main kaamyaab rahete the
 On the basis of that, their claim to superiority would be determined
 samaaj main kissagoi kii parampara ke sampusht hone kaa hi parinaam tha ki ramcharitamanas kii shuruyaat tulsidas kakbhushundi ke mukh se karaate hai
 The profoundly serious philosopher Gavishna, like the Gita, comes from the face of Shri Krishna, Arjuna is a volume listener there
 puri mahabharat sanjay kaa ‘kathan’ he
 This is the secret of the popularity of Devkinandan Khatri, Premchand, Pandey Bechan Sharma 'ugra', Amritlal Nagar, Vijayadan Detha etc
 among the modern prose of Kisagoi style
 markhej ke gadhy main maujuud jaadui yatharthwaad darasal kissagoi kaa vah laalitya hi he; jisaki aaj puri duniya divaani ho rahi he
 Being an indispensable part of the ethos, it is important that the story should be tested by the public
 use lokaruchi ke anusaar vishyon ke chayan kii kala aati ho
 It is noteworthy that the story has developed as an art of mass entertainment
 kahan ke bheetar hi samooh ke prati sambodhan kii bhaavana chhipi he
 Man is a social animal
 uske sukh-dukh saajhe hai
 Therefore, everyone has the same rights over the medium of entertainment or public entertainment
 kissago yah maanakar chalata he ki vah dusron ke, jo asal main uske apane hi samaaj kaa hissaa hai, kalyaan kaa hetu he
 That is why it often presents itself with a sense of belonging and harmony, without any greed for presentation
 janakalyaan kii bhaavana or uske liye nishaklush samarpan hi kissa or kissagoi ko sarvaswikaarya or upyogi banaata he
 In the book, however, kisasagoi exists only as a genre
 or unase guzarate samay pathak praayah akelaa hi hota he
 But it is presented in a collective address where the author narrates rather than writes
 jisase pathak ko hameshaa yah anubhuti bani rahati he ki vah akelaa nahin he
 But Brihad is a very important unit of society
 kissagoi kaa yahi gun usko sampreshan kii baaki shaileyon se alag or vishisht siddh karata he tathaa uski lokvyapti kii sambhaavnaaon ko badhaata he
 Hence collectivity can be seen as an essential feature of anecdote
 samuhikta ke saath-saath sarvloukikta kii bhaavana bhi kissagoi se sambhddha rahati he
 However, different countries and societies of the world have their own special characteristics due to geographical and situational reasons
 vahi use baaki deshon or samaajon se alag siddh karti hai
 Despite this, there are some similarities in the nature of people living in different countries and societies
 vahi unhen ek-duusare ke kareeb bhi laati hai
 Just like all societies in the world think the same about morality
 praayah sabhi maanviya samaajon main pranimatra ke prati karunaa ko udaatt maanviya mulya mana gaya gaya he
 Similarly, charity is the essential duty name in all societies
 iske vipareet jhooth, beyimaani, dhokhaa aadi dugurnon ko hey maanate hue inase bachane kii shiksha sabhi samaajon main samaanroop main di jaati he
 For the success of an anecdote, it is necessary that behind it there is a lofty sense of eternal life value and universalism
 tabhi use vibhinn ruchi or vichaar ke vyaktiyon kaa samarthan mil paata he
 Due to this, Kisagoi-dominated creations prove to be successful in traveling across the world by crossing the boundaries of the country and regions
 is bich unamem haalanki kuch na kuch antar swaabhaavik rup se aa hi jaataa he, magar rachana kii mul aatma praayah aparivartit hi rahati he
 Often the same subjects are successful in getting acceptance in the story which are beyond dispute and whose everlasting usefulness has been proved
 yahaan tak ki manoranjan ke str par bhi yah dhyaan baraabar rakhaa jaataa he ki usase kisi vyakti, dharm athwa varg kii bhavanaaen aahat na hon
 And he should not be so 'bulgar' that he cannot be heard or heard in the group
 aise vishay jo desh-kaal kii simaaon se pare hon or thode-bahut badlaav ke baad kisi bhi samaaj kii kahani kaa aadhaar ban saken; jinamein anrtnihit satya bahusankhyak samaajon kaa satya banane kii yogyata rakhata ho, kisson main zyada lokapriy maane jate hai
 Kisagoi was born to Lokaranjan
 log pramukhtah manoranjan kii talash main kissago ke sampark main aate hai
 The underlying value in the story-story remains after that
 isliye kissagoi ke aavashyak lakshanon main rochakata bhi vishesh mahatva rakhti he
 In the absence of this, the success of the story is not possible
 iskaa arth yah bhi na maan liya jaae ki keval manoranjan hi kissagoi kaa abhisht hota he
 Any statement about life and humanity becomes important only when it either explains any rationale or is connected to it in some way
 lokranjan yadi sakaaratmak charitron, ghatnaon par aadhaarit he athwa unhen kisi bhi rup main varenya siddh karata he to shrota / pathak usase saamanytah prerana lete hi hai
 Therefore, in an anecdote, insistence on morality is always required
 parantu use iske dabaavaan se sarvatha mukt rahanaa chahie
 There should be no intrusion of morality on the value of interestingness in the story
 duusare shabdon main gyaan athwa mulya rachanaatmak prastuti ke samutpaada athwa sah-utpaada to ho sakate hai, mul utpaada nahin
 Even if this is so, this work should be done with such skill that the reader or listener does not even realize it
 yani rachana kaa prastutikaran itnaa sahaj or rasaatmak hona chahie ki vah shrotaaon-pathakon ko apane jaadui aakarshan main baandh le
 One of the criteria for success in Kisago is how close Kisago is able to bring its reader or listener to you during the presentation
 antarangta kaa yahi gun logon ke dilon main kissago ke prati lagaav paidaa karata he
 This continues to take his popularity forward
 safal kissago vahi he jisaki aawaaj ke uthaan ke saath-saath shrota antariksh kii saiyr karne lagen or uskaa tehraav dekhakar unhen vakt tehra-tehra-sa lagane lage
 Whose listener or reader, while listening or reading the composition, feel himself so intimate with it that there is no possibility of any kind of duality, just drifting in the flow of anecdote
 iske liye kissago ko apane bauddhik aham se kai paaydaan neeche utarkar apane apane shrota yaa pathak se sidhe samvaad karnaa hota he
 a sense of incompatibility of any kind not only makes Kissago's style cumbersome; It can also push listeners / readers towards other means of entertainment
 jaahir he ki iske liye prastuti ko bhashaa ke str par bhi sanvarna or tarashna padataa he
 The use of intuitive idiomatic language helps in improving the narrative
 jaisaa ki upar kaha gaya he ki kissa kalatmak kahan kii parampara kaa niksh he
 In which Kissago presents any piece of history, event or story in an interesting way to the listener with the sum of his experience, knowledge and imagination
 kuch is tarah ki shrota usamen duubakar rah jaaen
 Even they do not realize the time
 vah praayah brihad shrotavarg ko sambodhit hota he
 Which can also be illiterate and of different moods and interests
 bhashaai bojhilta, shailigat chamatkaaron athwa vaicharik kattarta kaa kissagoi main koi sthaan nahin hota
 Simple, idiomatic and full of dispatching language is suitable for kissing
 is kasuti par khara utarana har achche kissago ke liye ek chunauti hoti he
 It depends on the narrator's own style, creativity and presentation skills to be able to captivate his readers / listeners
 muhaavaron or lokoktiyon kaa aasaan or avasraanukool upyog use lokapriy tathaa prabhavayukt banaata he
 In this part of the article, we will assess the usefulness of storytelling in the context of child literacy
 yah bhi jaanane kaa prayaas karenge ki kissagoi pradhan rachanaaen bacchon main kyon adhik lokapriy hoti hai
 Almost all societies have been victims of gender base discrimination
 kissagoi kii kala yadhyapi striyon or bacchon main samaanroop se lokapriy rahi he
 But due to the circumstantial difference there has been some variation
 chepal-samskruti kii maryaada yaa uski seemaa ke chalate chapaalon par jawan, bachche or boode to ja sakate the
 But women and young children were prohibited for various reasons
 is kaaran kissagoi kii kala gharon main bhi samaanroop main viksit to hui, parantu kinchit bhinnata ke saath
 One of the main differences between the two is that the work on the chapals was often done by a skilled storyteller or a well-versed person who specialized in the art of storytelling
 vahiin gharon main yah daayitv dada-daadi, naanaa-nani, buaa yaa aise hi parivaar ke kisi varisht sadsy dwaara uthaaya jaataa tha
 It was only through an anecdote that the child was given practical knowledge of his tradition, culture and politics etc
 bachapan main kisse-kahani ke prati janma anuraag hi vyakti ko kissagoi ke charchit thikaanonμ jaise chairahon, chapaalon tathaa aise hi anya saarvjaanik sthalon tak le jaataa tha
 Whereas due to circumstantial differences, domestic performances were often limited to small stories
 aksar chapaalon par sunaae jane vaale bade kisse sankshipt rup lekar baat yaa batakahi kaa rup dhaaran kar lete the
 However, the magic of Kisagoi was completely present in them too
 kaha ja saktaa he ki praarambhik shikshan-sanskaar ke saath-saath kissagoi ke liye utsuk maanas, uske prati anuraag or aakarshan ghar ke angan, mata kii god se hi paidaa hone lagata tha or balak unheen ke madhyam se baahar kii duniya ko samajhane kaa prayaas karata tha
 The story of Kisagoi is amazing due to which in the past, stories used to travel to far-flung countries without any publication facility, even media
 puraa loksahitya dekha jaae to kissagoi kii kala kaa rini he
 Due to the popularity and accessibility of Kisagoi, the stories of Panchatantra are not only prevalent in all countries around the world, but they have also undergone extensive changes to suit local interests and traditions
 iskaa sabase acha udhaaharan isap kii kahaniyaan hai jinpar panchatantra kaa puraa-puraa prabhaav he
 Born in the sixth century BC, Aesop was a minor slave in Greece
 shakl-surat se badsoorat
 But his fans were not lacking
 apane samaaj main uskaa sammaan tha
 Because he was an excellent anecdote skilled in the art of pulsing his listeners
 niti or vyaavhaarik gyaan ko kahaniyon main dhalkar sunaane main usko maharath hasil thi
 In his stories he also used the stories of Panchatantra which reached Greece after traveling thousands of miles
 lagbhag satarah shatabdiyon tak isap kii kahaniyaan shruti ke madhyam se ek desh se duusare desh tak kii yatra karti raheen
 The Chinese philosopher Confucius also used the parable tradition to propagate his ideas among the masses
 kissagoi kii mahatta ko darshata ek udhaaharan or bhi he
 The story of a badass king who is very funny in himself and is still heard and heard with a lot of juice
 usamen kisse kaa shaukeen badshaah kisi baat par shahzadi se naaraaz ho jaataa he
 Before the punishment, the wise princess wants him to narrate an anecdote
 badshaah taiyaar ho jaataa he
 But as soon as one anecdote came to an end, Shahzadi would have added another anecdote to it with cleverness and artistry
 kissa sunate-sunaate raat biit jaati
 The emperor was so immersed in the tales that the rest of his part would give Shahzadi one more time to live to hear the next night
 is tarah din par din bitate chale gaye
 The king eventually forgives that wise princess
 yah akelaa prasang hi kisse kii takat kaa andaaj karaane ke liye paryaapt he
 However, this anecdote also casts sarcasm on the lifestyle and infamy of the emperors
 germany kii lokkathaon ko sankalit karne ke liye grim-bandhuon ke prayaas kii saraahna duniya-bhar main hui he
 The folklore compiled by him is compiled in a book called Jagatprasiddha 'grimms Fairy Tales'
 kahaniyon ko jutaney liye grim bandhuon ne germany ke gaanv-gaanv jaakar bujurgon se kahaniyaan suni thim
 In this connection there is a very interesting incident which is mentioned by the Grimm brothers as their experiences during the compilation of stories that 


 Once they reach a village there they are told about a witch old lady Told in jiske paas gaanvvaale apane bacchon ko bhejne se kataraate the
 Someone also informed them that the old lady has an immense wealth of stories
 parantu saath hi yah bhi bataa diya ki vah ‘jaaduugarani or dian he
 There is a chauder who casts such a spell on children that children scream and cry in the night with scary dreams
 ’ grim-bandhu kahaniyon kii khoj main nikle the
 So they reached the old lady and requested her to tell the story
 jawaab main budhiya ne shart laga di ki vah kahani tabhi suna sakati he, jab shrota ke rup main vahaan bachche bhi upasthit hon
 On the other hand, the villagers were not ready to send their children to the old lady
 isse grim-bandhuon ke saamne vikat samasya upasthit ho gai
 The old lady was stubborn
 lokkathaon ke moh main grim bandhu bhi vahaan se niraash lautne ko taiyaar nahin the
 The Grimm brothers eventually enlisted the help of one of their friends
 usne gaanvvaalon ko samajhaayaa
 They also assured the safety of their children
 antat kaaphi prayaas ke baad, gaanvvaale apane bacchon ko budhiya ke paas bhejne ko raji ho gaye
 The victim of the harassment of the villagers for years, away from the village and living alone, the eyes of the old woman shone as soon as they saw the children
 vah kahani sunaane ko taiyaar ho gai
 And then as soon as the old lady started the first anecdote, the Grimm brothers along with the children were also enchanted
 uski kahani sunaane kala itani adbhut or romaanchak thi ki kuch der ke liye sab apana aapa bhuulane lage
 While narrating the story, sometimes she would growl like a lion and sometimes she would start twittering like a bird
 kahani main billi kaa zikr aate hi vah jhat se miaun-miaun karne lagati
 Not only this, the old lady with her voice was adept at producing such a loud soundtrack like thunder, rain, thunder clouds
 uske kahan main jaadui prabhaav tha
 As long as the old lady told the stories, they kept listening hypnotically
 uske baad grim bandhuon kii samaj main sara rahasy aa gaya
 Through effective presentation of the event, the old man used to create such lively images that the characters and events of the children would start to feel real and penetrate directly into their hearts and minds
 unka asar bhi der tak rahata
 Due to which they would get scared in dreams
 apane is anubhav kaa varnan grim-bandhuon ne vistaar se kiya he
 They write that we have made the children sit in front of that old lady and we ourselves sat behind the curtain in an equal room
 budhiya kahaniyaan sunaane lagi or hamane unhen lipibaddh karnaa shuru kar diya
 grimm-bandhu writes that 'when the old lady started telling the story, we realized that she was probably the best storyteller in the world who specializes in the art of storytelling
 

vah varsha, aandhi, jaanwaron, chidiyon aadi ke dhwani-prabhaav apane munh se paidaa karti or kahani ko atyadhik prabhaavshaalee bana detii
 The magic of this story art was that magic; Which used to dominate the minds and minds of children
 usee ke prabhaav ke kaaran ve sapanom main un chitron ko saakaar dekhakar dar jate the
 'the villagers, ignorant of this secret, used to disgust and stigmatize the old lady as a sorceress, witch, witch, etc
 is bare main ham sabhi ekamat hai ki bachche kahaniyaan padhane ke bajaae praayah unako sunanaa adhik pasand karte hai
 There is no pressure on the child's mind while listening to the story as it is often while reading
 isliye vah kahani or usamen nihit sandesh ko aatmsaat karata hua chalata he
 Some such incidents of the story, the personality of the characters in it, etc
 keep developing in its psyche
 antarangta ke gun ke kaaran hi balpathak un rachanaaon kii prati adhik lagaav rakhata he jo uske man kii baat ko baatcheet ke andaaj main uske aamane-saamne baithkar kii jaati hai
 Therefore, this style is not only the most liked by the boys but it also has the scope of using the most for the author
 is kaaran vahi baalsahityakar adhik lokapriy hue hai jinhone kissagoi ko samasamyik sandarbhon ke saath jodate hue sahitya rachana kii he
 Being in direct communication with the readers, there is a natural flow in his work
 acha kissago apane shrotaaon ko baandhe rakhane ke liye chitratmakataa or naatakeeyata kaa sahaara letaa he
 In textbooks, there is usually an external pressure to assimilate knowledge
 jo balak ke man main tanaav kii paidaa karata he
 From which he tries to run away from textbooks
 ek or sach yah bhi he ki pathyapustakon main praayah gaveshnatmak style kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 The study style also gets progressively more complex depending on the subject
 jisase balak ko baraabar yah ehsaas bana rahata he ki use sikhaaya yaa padhaayaa ja rahaa he
 Someone who wants to take him to a particular direction
 

uski swatantrata main avarohak bana he
 

first for education, his psyche reads books with some compulsion but at the same time the urge to avoid them, the desire to run away from them, a prohibition towards didacticism also keeps on popping in his mind
 kissago kaa apnatv tathaa kissagoi style main uplabdh rachanaaen use gyaan or prastutikaran kii ekresata se ubaarti hai
 In other styles of communication, there exists a duality between the writer and the reader
 jisase pathak rachana kaa puraa ras nahin le paata
 To him, that composition seems to be imposed from above

 In this, there is the essence of imagination, not unnecessary pressure of intellect, therefore, this style of communication is especially liked by children

 Knowledge becomes interesting and receptive through imagination

 Which takes the listener or reader beyond reality

 Tremendous fantasy epics and Greek legends have also received criticism despite being interesting due to the predominance of this genre

 16veen shatabdi ke prarambh main samast pashchimi europe dharmik drushti se ek tha - sabhi isai the; sabhi roman katholic carch ke sadsy the; uski parampargat shiksha maanate the or dharmik maamalon main uske adhyaksh arthath rome ke pope kaa shashan sweekaar karte the
 European reforms or reforms refer to the great movement of the 16th century, which resulted in this unity of Western Christians being disintegrated and Protestant religion emerged
 carch ke itihas main samay-samay par sudhaarwadi andolan hote rahe kintu ve carch ke dharmik siddhaton athwa uske shaskaon ko chunauti na dekar unke nirdesh ke anusaar hi naitik buraaiyon kaa unmoolan tathaa dharmik shiksha kaa prachaar apana uddeshy maanate the
 The reform movement that began in the 16th century soon began to oppose both the traditional teaching of the Church and the authority of its rulers
 dharmasudhar andolan ke parinamswaroop europe main catholic sampradaay ke saath-saath luther sampradaay, calvin sampradaay, anglican sampradaay or presbyterian sampradaay prachlit ho gayi
 To understand this new form of reform, it is very important to consider the present situation in Europe
 isa dwaara pravartit katholic carch ke prati isaayiyon main jo shraddha kaa bhav shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa tha vah kai kaarnon se kam ho gaya tha
 In the 14th century, a French pope was elected, who remained in France throughout his life
 iske falswaroop baad main 40 varsh tak do pope vidyaman the, ek france main or ek rome main, jisase samast katholic sansar do bhaagon main vibhakt rahaa
 In the eighth century, the Catholic king of the Franks defeated the Lavard army invading Italy and gave the central part of Italy under the authority of the Pope, and thus became an ordinary ruler in addition to the cleric of the Roman Catholic Church
 is kaaran germany or france ke raja sahaj hi carch ke maamalon main or visheshkar pope ke chunaav main hastkshep karne kaa prayaas karte rahe
 In the late 14th century, this election became a competition ground for Italian elites, focusing less on the individual's merit and more on his lineage
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki us samay nitant ayogy popon kaa chunaav hua or rome ke darbar main naitikta tathaa dharm kii upeksha hone lagi
 So it was quite natural for the Church of Rome to lose respect
 asantosh kaa ek or kaaran yah tha ki samast carch kii sansthaaon par unki sampatti ke anusaar kar lagaaya jaataa tha or rome ke pratinidhi sarvada ghumkar yah rupaya vasuul karte the
 Apart from this predicament of the central organization of the Church, the condition of various religions was not satisfactory
 is samay samast pashchimi europe lagbhag saat sau dharmapraanton main vibhakt tha
 Their rulers were called bishops
 ye bishap samant the jo raja dwaara praaia: abhijaat varg main se chune jate the, darbar ke sadsy the or germany main bahudhaa apane kshetra ke raajnneetik shaasha bhi the
 Therefore, many bishops were more interested in politics, less interested in religion and left the religious administration of their homeland to the highly empowered priests of the university
 gaanvon main basanevaale adhikansh saadhaaran purohit ardhashikshit the
 They were unable to give lectures and were often poor
 saadhaaran purohiton kii yah dayaneey dasha 16veen shatabdi ke europea katholic carch kii sab se badi kamajori thi
 There was no one to teach religious education to the general public except the visiting Franciscans etc
 isse sarvatra andhvishwaas fail gaya or karmkand ko anaavashyak evam asantulit mahatv diy jane laga
 In the 13th century, Catholic theology gave a rational representation of the doctrines through the Christian interpretation of Aristotle and the Scholastic Philosophy, but in the 15th century the focus and contemplation of the fundamental problems of religion were removed
 vishvavidhyalayon main dharmapandit gaun prashnon ke vishay main apane matbhedon ko adhik mahatv dene lage the jisase katholic dharmavigyaan itan nishpraan ho gaya tha ki kuch saadhakon kii yah dharna drudh ho gai thi ki dharmavigyaan sadhana main baadhak he
 Thus we see that there was a need for reform in all the areas of the church and the movement for reforms became imperative
 14veen shatabdi main angarej vicliff or baad main bohemia ke na hus jo sikhalaane lage the ki carch kaa sanghathan, uske sanskaar aadi yah sab manushyon kaa avishkaar he; isaayiyon ke liye bible hi paryaapt he
 Even at that time those ideas did not get much success, but their influence on Luther is obvious
 spain main tolido ke arbobishap cemeness ne carch ke anushaasan ke andar dharmasudhar andolan pravartit kiya jisase vahaan kaa vaataavaran purna rup main badal gaya kintu pashchimi europe main carch kii paristhiti main koi vishesh parivartan nahin ho paaya tha
 When Luther raised his voice against Rome, he had unprecedented success for another reason
 europe main us samay sarvatra pracheen unani tath latin sahitya kii lokapriyata ke saath saath ek naveen saanskrithik andolan prarambh hua jise rinesaan athwa navajagaran kaha gaya he
 As a result, a sense of personal freedom arose in the people
 mudran ke avishkaar ke kaaran isi samay se bible kii mudrit pratiyaan adhik saraltapurvak sulabh hone lagi thim, jisase logon ko apni ore se dharm ke vishay main sochane or bible ko apni nijee vyakhya karne kii pravriti ko bhi protsaahan milane laga tha
 The historical development of the European Reformation is as follows: It began with Luther's rebellion in 1517 AD
 unhone kin paristhitiyon main apana andolan pravartit kiya tha or carch ke kin paramparaagat siddhanto kaa virodh karke kis prakaar ek nayaa dharm chalaaya tha, iskaa varnan vishwakosh main anyatra kiya gaya he 
 At that time all of Germany was divided into about four hundred independent states
 unke adhikansh shaskaon ne katholic samrat charles ke virodh main luther ko sarankshan pradaan kiya or apni praja ko luther ke carch main mila diya
 Soon all the Scandinavian Christians also joined the Lutheran religion
 switsraland main dharmasudhar ke do netaa sarvapradhan the - jurik main jinvagli or janeeva main calovin, donon ke anuyaayi baad main ek hi kelvinist carch main sammilit ho gaye
 The sect also spread to Holland, Scotland and parts of France
 scotland main iskaa naam presbytareey dharm rakhaa gaya he france main pehle luther kaa prabhaav padaa kintu baad main vahaan ke adhikansh protestat dharmavalambee, jo yugani kehalaate hai, calovin ke anuyaayi ban gaye
 His organization was active for a long time as a political party
 england ke raja ne prarambh hi se luther kaa virodh kiya tha
 He also wrote a treatise in which he gave the pope's divine right to matters of religion
 yadhyapi henry jivan bhar apane rajya main protestant siddhanton kaa prachaar rokane kaa prayaas karte rahe, phir bhi unhone vyaktigat kaarnon se 1531 i
 main england kaa carch rome se alag kar diya, is prakaar anglican samudaay prarambh hua tha
 The Protestant ideology had a profound influence on the church during the time of Henry's successors, which is now considered one of the three major branches of Protestant religion, but the Anglican community in fact has its own distinct history of origin, development and propagation
 in teen sampradaayon ke atirikt dharmasudhar andolan ke falswaroop protestant dharm ke or bahut se upsampradaayon kaa udbhav hua jinka yahan par ullekh karnaa anaavashyak he
 Some details of the sects which are of relatively more importance are given elsewhere in the dictionary
 is simhavlokan se spasht ho jaataa he ki luther dwaara pravartit sudhaar andolan ne vibhinn rup dhaaran kar samast europe ko hilaa diya
 Initially the reform of the church was the aim of this movement, but it soon began to attack the traditional education of the church and the organizational unity of the church
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki europe ke isaisansar kii ekta shatabdiyon ke liye chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Completely independent sects emerged from the point of view of governance, which, while believing the same Jesus and the Bible, give different opinions about many fundamental religious principles
 raajnneetik drushti se dharmasudhar kaa parinaam bahut hi vyapak rahaa
 The later condition of Europe was such that the rulers too inevitably took an active part in this religious movement
 ve apni praja ko apane hi dharm main sammilit karne athwa banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye
 Thus many wars in the name of religion are discussed in the history of Europe, such as the 30-year war in Germany, the Yugno War in France and the successful freedom struggle against Emperor Charles v in Holland
 upar iskaa ullekh ho chukaa he ki katholic carch main samay samay par sudhaar andolanon kaa pravarttan hota rahaa he kintu 16veen shatabdi ke vidrohatmak dharmasudhar se katholic carch ko vishesh rup se prerana mili
 This century saw the election of talented individuals as pope who have again given priority to spirituality under the rule of the Church, which again led to the reappearance of the pope in the entire Catholic world
 bishpon kii samantshahi ko samaapt kar diya gaya or chaaron or sadhuswabhaav vyaktiyon kii niyukti se janata ke saamne bishap kaa pracheen adarsh ubharne laga, jo apni praja kaa dharmaguru evam aadhyatmik charvaaha he
 The 19th World Assembly of the Church was organized in the city of Trent, in addition to the new organization of the Church, in particular the teaching of ordinary priests was arranged
 at: carch kii sabhi shreniyon main sudhaar hua or jansadharan main dharmik shiksha kaa uchit prachaar ho sakaa
 In this work, religious leaders have shared the hands of other priests
 16veen shatabdi main jesuit aadi kai dharmasanghon kii sthapana hui tathaa pracheen dharmasanghon main sudhaar laayaa gaya jisase ve sabake sab samay kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar dharm kii seva kar saken
 In this way, we see that perhaps the most profound and beneficial effect of the Reformation was on the old Catholic Church
 europea dharmasudhar kaa vyapak prasar evam gaharaa prabhaav dekhakar anayas hi man main yah prashn uthta he ki is apurv safalataa kaa kya rahasy he
 Several reasons for this success have been conceived: 15veen shatabdi ke aarambh main katholic carch kii dayaneey dasha or iske karnadhaaron kii niskriyata, carch kii sampati hadapney ko utsuk rajanetaaon kii sahaayta, navajagaran ke kaaran vyaktigat swatantraaa kaa andolan, mudran ke avishkaar se prachaar kii nai suvidhaayen
 All this proved to be helpful for the under-reported movement, but the secret of its success must be found elsewhere
 dharmasudhar ke pravartak satvik or dharmik bhav se prerit the or ve apane pratibhashali sahyogiyon main bhi dharmik navajagaran kii utkar abhilaashaa utpann karne main samarth hue
 In his view, the only remedy for that renaissance seemed to be that man would not surrender to Jesus by believing in his virtuous deeds, and believe in the Bible's gospel of Jesus safely
 unhone bible ko apane andolan kaa aadhaar bana liya, bible main jo shakti nihit he usee ke dwaara unhen safalataa mili he
 Nowadays 16th century events are being considered in the Christian world in neutral terms
 kathilak europea dharmasudhar kii rachanaatmak uplabdhiyon ko sweekaar karte hai or protetianst samajhane lage hai ki carch kii tatkaaleen buraaiyon kaa virodh karnaa kitna hi aavashyak kyon na tha, uski ekta chhin bhinn karne se isai dharm ko bahut haani hui he
 After the Second World War, the movement for Christian unity has been given utmost importance and the desire to remove the ill effects of the reforms is increasing
 martin luther ke purv dharmasudharkon ne chaudaavin sadi se hi carch or popashahi kii aniatikta, bhrashtataa, vilasita or shoshan ke viruddh apni aawaaj buland kii or unhone dharm sudhaar kii prishth bhoomi taiyaar kii

 vividhikaran kisi company ke liye ek tarah kii vyavsaayik ranneeti he
 It seeks to increase profits through new products and greater sales from new markets
 vividhikaran yaa to vyavsaayik ikai ke str par ho sakati he yaa phir corporate str par
 vyavsaayik ikai ke str par, iske kaaphi had tak ek aise udyog ke nae segment main vistaar kii gunjaaish rahati he jisamen iskaa kaarobaar pehle se he
 It is also very interesting to enter into a lucrative business at the corporate level and generally outside the scope of the existing business unit
 vividhikaran product / market insof matrix dwaara paribhaashit chaar pramukh marketing ranneetiyon kaa hissaa he: Picture: Ansoff diversification
jpg insof ne bataaya ki vividhikaran kii ranneeti teen anya ranneetiyon se alag khadi hoti he
 The first three strategies typically use the same technical, financial and sales resources for the original product line, while diversification usually requires the company to acquire new qualifications, new technologies, and new features
 note : vividhikaran kii dharna "nae" utpaada or "nae" bazaar kii vyaktiparak vyakhya par nirbhar karti he, jisamen prabandhakon kii bajaay graahakon kii samaj pratibimbit honi chahie
 vastav main, utpaada nae bazaaron ko banaate yaa protsaahit karte hai; nae bazaar avishkaari utpaadon ko badhaava dete hai
 Diversification strategies may include internal development of new products or markets, acquisition of a company, alliance with a complementary company, licensing new technologies, and distributing or importing a line of products manufactured by another farm
 aam taur par, antim ranneeti in vikalpon kaa ek sanyukt rup he
 This combination is determined by the objectives and resources of the company in the functioning of available opportunities and sustainability
 vividhikaran ke teen prakaar hai: sankendrit, kshaitij or samuhik: This means that there is a technical similarity between industries, which means that the company is able to leverage its technical expertise to gain some profit
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek company jo audyogic asanjakon kaa utpaadan karti he vah in asanjakon ko khudara vikritaon ke madhyam se bechney kaa vividhta purna nirnay le sakati he
 Technology may be the same but marketing efforts need to be changed
 aisa lagata he ki isamen ek nae utpaada ko pesh karne ke liye apni bazaar hissedari ko bhi badhaayaa jaataa he jo kisi vishesh company ko laabh arjeet karne main madad karata he
 However, there is another example, the inclusion of tomato ketchup and sauce in the processed ingredients of the existing "maggi" brand of Food Specialties Ltd
, as an example of technology-based concentrated diversification
 company aise nae utpaadon yaa sevaaon ko jodatii he jo maujuuda utpaadon ke liye takneekee rup se yaa vyavsaayik rup se asambaddha hote hai, lekin ye maujuuda graahakon ko aakarshith kar sakate hai
 In a competitive environment, this type of diversification is desirable when existing customers have confidence in existing products and when new products are of good quality and are well promoted and priced
 iske alaava, nae utpaadon kii marketing usee aarthik maahaul main kii jaati he jisamen maujuuda utpaadon kii hoti he, jo dridhtaa or asthirataa utpann kar sakati he
 In other words, this strategy increases the company's dependence on certain market segments
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek aisi company jo pehle kapiyaan banaati thi ab vah apane nae utpaada ke madhyam se kalam ke bazaar main bhi pravesh kar rahi he
 Horizontal integration occurs when a company enters a new business in the same stage of production as its current operation
 udhaaharan ke liye, evan dwaara ghar-ghar jaakar bechney vaale apane karmiyon ke madhyam se gahanon ko bechney ke nirnay main vitaran ke maujuuda channelon ke madhyam se nae utpaadon kii marketing kii ranneeti shaamil thi
 An alternative form of this was also adopted by Avon which was to sell its products by mail order and through retail outlets
 donon hi maamalon main, evan abhi bhi utpaadan prakriya ke khudara str par maujuud he
 The company markets new products or services that have no technical or commercial harmony with existing products, but which may attract new groups of customers
 company ke varttman kaarobaar se samuhik vividhikaran kaa sambandh nahin ke baraabar hota he
 Therefore, the main reason for adopting such a strategy is first to improve the profitability and flexibility of the company and secondly to get a better acceptance in the capital market as the company grows 
 yahaan tak ki agar yah ranneeti bahut hi jokhim bhari hoti he, safal hone par, yah bhi pragati or laabhpradata ko badha sakati he
 According to Calorie and Harvatopoulos, the justification for diversification has two dimensions
 pehla ek ranneetik uddeshy kii prakruti se sambandhit he: vividhikaran rakshaatmak yaa aakraamak ho saktaa he
 Defensive reasons may be to increase the risk of market contraction, or be forced to diversify when it appears that the current product or current market trend may not provide further growth opportunities
 aakraamak kaaran nayi sthitiyon par badhat praapt karne vaale or nae avasar pradaan karne vaale ho sakate hai jo vistaar ke maukon kii tulana main kahin adhik laabhpradata kaa vaada karte hai, yaa isamen surakshit rakhi gayi nagdi kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jo kul vistaar kii jaruraton se adhik ho jaataa he
 The second dimension includes the expected results of diversification: management may expect higher economic value or wider cohesion and complementarity for its current activities first and foremost
 iske alaava, companiyaan sirf is ranneeti or vistaar ke bich ek bahumoolya tulanaatmak adhyayan ke liye vividhikaran kaa rasta apana sakati hai
 Diversification is the most risky of the four strategies presented in the Ansoff matrix and requires the most careful investigation
 ek aparichit utpaada kii peshkash ke saath ek agyaat bazaar main utarane kaa matlab he iske liye aavashyak nayi yogyataon or takneekon ke maamle main anubhav kii kami
 is prakaar, company apane aapako ek bahut badi anischitata kii sthiti main daal leti he
 In addition, diversification may require a broad expansion of human and financial resources, which can become a barrier to focused attention, commitment, and continued investment in key industries
 isliye kisi bhi company ko yah vikalp tabhi chunanaa chahie jab maujuuda utpaada yaa bazaar kaa maujuuda rukh vikaas ke liye aage or adhik avasar pradaan nahin karata ho
safalataa kii sambhaavna ko maapne ke kram main vibhinn pareekshan kiye ja sakate hai: Due to the above mentioned high level risks, many companies attempting diversification have suffered failure
 haalanki, safal vividhikaran ke kuch achche udhaaharan bhi maujuud hai: The Rashtriya Seva Yojana is an active program run by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, for the personality development of youth empowerment of the nation
 iske gatividhiyon main bhaag lene vaale vidhyaarthee, samaaj ke logon ke saath milakar samaaj ke hit ke kaary karte he

 The ADB was actually planned by some influential Japanese who in 1962 formulated a "private plan" for a regional bank, which was later supported by the government
 japaniyon ko aisa anubhav hua ki asia se unka hitsaadhan world bank ke dwaara nahin ho paa rahaa he or isliye vah ek aisa bank sthapit karnaa chaahate the jisame japan ko sansthagat laabh praapt ho
 After the establishment of the ADB in 1966, Japan acquired a distinctive position in the bank; It received the chairmanship and some other "reserved posts" such as the post of director of the administrative department
 By the end of 1972, Japan had contributed $ 173
7 million in general capital resources and $ 122
6 million in specific funds

 ADB proves Japan's economic interests as its debt mostly goes to Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and the Philippines, all of which are countries with which Japan has significant commercial ties; In 1967-72, 78
48 percent of the total loan issued by ADB was given to these countries

8 percent from Europe and 11
7 percent from the United States
 haalanki, purv ke vyavhaar se hatate hue ab japan 1980 ke dashak ke madhya se adhik nirankush ho gaya tha
 Japan's plan was to use ADB as a carrier for recycling its huge additional capital and as a "catalyst" to attract private Japanese capital to the region

 ADB has played a role in directing Japan's private capital to Asia by improving local infrastructure

0 billion in 2011 by a GCI of 200 percent
 is vruddhi ke saath bank kaa puunji aadhaar 55 billian dollar se badhkar tiguna ho gaya arthath 165 billian dollar ho gaya
 Given the annual loan volume of ADB, the return on investment in training studies for operational and developmental impact is likely to be high and maximizing this is a reasonable concern

 There are two types of assessment: independent and self-assessment
 Self-assessment is done by the units that are responsible for formulating and implementing planning, programs, projects or technical assistance activities in a country
 isamen kai saadhan sammilit hote hai, jisame pariyojna / kaarykram kii pradarshan report, madhyavadhi samikshatmak report, takneekee sahaayta yaa pariyojna / kaarykram samaapan report or us desh ke portpholio kii samiksha report shaamil hai
 All projects in the project completion report are self-rated by the appropriate units

 Customer governments are also required to prepare their own project completion reports

 It also recognizes self-assessment

 The evaluation of operations has changed since ADB began its evaluation in 1978
 shuruyaat main, pariyojna ke samaapt ho jane par is baat ke moolyankan par dhyaan kendrit kiya jaataa tha ki pariyojna ne kis had tak apekshit aarthik or saamaajik hitlabh ko praapt kiya he
 Now project evaluation shapes the decision making process throughout the project cycle and in a way overall ADB

 In recent years, the nature of oid's operational program has changed drastically, and in the past the importance of evaluating each project has now shifted to broader and more strategic studies

 Important issues at present are: Enhancing the quality of evaluations through more robust working practices; To prioritize nation / territory assistance programs; Increasing the number of joint evaluations, recognizing self-evaluation to shorten the learning cycle; Conduct even more effective effective evaluations; Development of evaluation capability in both ADB and DMC; Encourage portfolio performance; Evaluation of business processes; Ensuring publicity and use of information and suggestions

 In the mid-term, the OED will continue to improve institutional culture, management systems, business processes, information technology solutions, practice communities, and external relationships and mechanisms for study training
 Newly developed knowledge products and features have study curves useful and simple, in the form of a two-page short and quick reference that provides information on assessment news reports regarding supervision and evaluation events from a wide range of customers and Provide suggestions

 Since the early days of ADB, critics have been accusing two major providers, Japan and the United States, of influencing decisions related to large-scale lending, policies and staff recruitment

 It has also been criticized that large scale projects of ADB cause social and environmental damage due to lack of foresight
 edibi se sambandhit pariyojnaon main ek sarvaadhik vivaadit pariyojna thailand kaa me moh koyala-chaalit power stesan rahaa he
 Environmental and human rights activists state that adb's environmental protection policy, as well as policies regarding natives and involuntarily arranged people, are internationally international in paper but often not followed in practice, They are too vague and weak to be effective, or simply put, the bank's rights They accepted is not applicable

 The civic body has accused the ADB of ignoring the warnings in relation to the crisis and that in the view of many people, the bank has deliberately made the terms of the loan such that the national governments are privatizing and regulating the agricultural sector Forced - which gave rise to other problems such as decreased supply of rice in Southeast Asia, thus creating a crisis Switch to contributions made

 The unit of measurement is probably one of the oldest inventions invented by humans because primitive society also required measurement for various tasks

 In relation to this, there was also the belief that they are the offspring of the original inhabitants of the fictional island called "atlantis continent" or "moo" of the Pacific Ocean mentioned in legends
 madhya america kii maaya indian jati or pracheen misr kii sthapatyakala main samta drushtigat hone ke kaaran yah anumaan bhi kiya gaya ki indian misr athwa misr se prabhavit deshon se america aae
 In this context, it is necessary to know that the ancient architecture of Egypt had declined several thousand years before the time when the Mayan Indians started construction of temples

 Even after diligently searching the scholars of ancient mankind, near human apes or ancient human beings could not find any remains here
 is tarah yah kaha ja saktaa he ki yahan maanav jati kii kisi shakha ke swatantra vikaas kii sambhaavna nahin thi or yahan ke pracheenatam nivaasiyon ke purvaj sansar ke kisi anya bhaag se aakar hi yahan based honge
 Experts believe that humans came to this part from Asia via the Bering Strait

 The ancestors of Indians who came to America via the route from the Ashes to Alaska had certainly developed to the level of modern humans or "homo sapiens"
 ve apane saath apni mul asian samskruti ke anek tatv bhi avashya laae honge

 It can also be said that they must have developed some primary form of language by that time

 While trying to reconstruct their original culture, Kroeber has made a list of the culture elements who probably came to America along with the Adi Indians

 Upon coming to America from Asia, the ancestors of Indians either completely separated from their native Asian branch or maintained some kind of relationship with it, there is a difference of opinion among scholars on this subject

 Later, the directions of cultural development that these groups adopted were not influenced by the Brahmo cultures
