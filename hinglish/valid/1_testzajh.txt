 iske tahat peedit vyakti aparaadh ke sandarbh main avilamb kaarywahi hetu kisi bhi police thane main apni shikaayat darj karvaa sakate hai evam baad main cese ko uparokt thane main transafar bhi karavaaya ja saktaa hai

 Mobile phone manufacturers, including solar cells, are experimenting on alternative sources of energy
 bydaree ke alaava, GSM mobile phone ko kaam karne ke liye ek choti si microchip kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise graahak pahchaan maapdand yaa sim card kaha jaataa he
 The SIM card of approximately a postage stamp size is usually placed at the back of the unit under the battery and stores the configuration data and information about the phone, such as which call scheme the user is using
 jab graahak sim card ko hataa detaa he, to ise pun: duusare phone main daal kar saamaanya rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each SIM card is activated by the use of a unique numeric identifier; Once activated, the identifier is localized and the card is permanently clad in the active network
 is kaaran se, adhikansh khudara vikreta ek sakriy kiye gaye sim card ko vaapis lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 Cell phones that do not use a SIM card have data programmed into their memory
 ek vishesh aankik kram kaa upyog karke is data kaa upyog kiya jaataa he he, "NAM" ko "naam" yaa number kramadesh suchi ke rup main upyog karne ke liye
 From here, one can get any information such as a number for your phone, new service provider number, new emergency number, change of their authentication key or A-key code and list or perl to rotate their favorites
 However, to prevent someone from accidentally deactivating their phone or deleting it from the network, service providers use a master assistant shut down or MSL on this data
 MSL yah sunishchit karata he ki seva pradaata khride gaye yaa patte par liye gaye phone ke liye bhugtan praapt karen
 For example, the Motorola RAZR V9C costs more than CAD $ 500
 lagbhag $200 main, vaahak ke aadhaar par, aapako ek mil sakati he
 The difference is paid by the customer as a monthly bill
 yadi graahak ne ek MSL kaa upyog nahin kiya, to ve $300 - $400 kaa antar kho denge jo unke masik bill main bhugtan kiya jaataa he, kyunki kuch graahak maujuuda seva ko radd karke duusare vaahak ke paas phone le jate hai
 The MSL applies to the SIM only because once the contract is completed, the MSL still applies to the SIM
 phone haalanki, shuru main bhi seva pradaata MSL main nirmaataa dwaara band kiya jaataa he
 This lock can be disabled so that this phone can use another service provider's SIM card
 america ke baahar kharide gaye phone khule phone hai kyonki vahaan zyaadaatar phone ek duusare ke nikatataa main kai seva pradaata yaa ativyapee vyapti he
 The cost of unlocking a phone varies but is usually very inexpensive and sometimes provided by independent phone vendors
 saamaanya vyapti kshetra ke baahar MSL seva pradaata ke upyog main ucch laagat kii vajah se ek khulaa phone yatriyon ke liye behad upyogi hota he
 This can sometimes be 10 times the price of using a closed phone as a foreigner in the general service area, even with discounted rates
 t-mobile allows its account holders to open a SIM code after a good 90 days Provide according to the FAQ
 udhaaharan ke liye, jamaika main, ek AT&T graahak bhunaai antarrashtriya seva ke liye $1
65 prati minute kaa atirikt bhugtan kar saktaa he jabaki ek B-mobile graahak ko samaan antarrashtriya seva ke liye $0
20 prati minute kaa bhugtan karnaa padegaa
kuch seva pradaata apane bikri ko antarrashtriya bikri par kendrit karte hai jabaki kuch kshetreey bikri par kendrit karte hai
 For example, the same b-mobile customer will pay less on local calls but more on international calls than in Jamaica's national phone C&W company
 yah mulya antar mukhyatah mudra parivartan ke kaaran hota he kyonki sim kii kharid sthaneey mudra main hoti he
 In the US, competition in these types of services does not exist because some major service providers do not offer pay-when-you-go service

 This mantra has 24 letters
 unamem aath aath aksharon ke teen charan hai
 But in the Brahmin texts and in all the literature of the period, the complete form of the mantra was stabilized in this way by adding three vyahitras before these letters and before them Pranav or Onkar
 mantra ke is rup ko manu ne sapranava, savyahritika gayatri kaha he or jap main isi kaa vidhaan kiya he
 What is the Gayatri element and why this mantra has so much glory, it is necessary to address this question
 aarsh manyata ke anusaar gayatri ek ore virat vishwa or duusari ore maanav jivan, ek ore devtatv or duusari ore bhootatatva, ek ore man or duusari ore praan, ek ore gyaan or duusari ore karm ke parsparik sambandhon kii puri vyakhya kar detii he
 The deity of this mantra is Savita, Savita is the noun of Surya, there are many forms of Surya, among them Savita is the form which inspires all the devas

 Gayatri mantra is favored to explain this relationship of mind and soul

 It is said in the third phase of Gayatri

 atev savita ke bharg kii prarthana main vishesh dhwani yah bhi he ki savita yaa man kaa jo divya ansh he vah parthiv yaa bhuton ke dharaatal par avateern hokar parthiv sharir main prakashit ho
 No other wish is found in this Gayatri Mantra
 yahan ek maatr abhilaashaa yahi he ki maanav ko ishwar kii ore se man ke rup main jo divya shakti praapt hui he uske dwaara vah usee savita kaa gyaan kare or karmon ke dwaara use is jivan main sarthak kare
 The three vyahtriyas to the east of Gayatri are also tolerant
 bhu prithvilok, rugveda, agni, parthiv jagat or jaagrath avasthaa kaa suchak he
 Bhuva: Astrology, Yajurveda, the god of air, is a sign of the vital world and self-state
 swa: dhuloak, samaveda, adityadevataa, manomay jagat or sushupti avasthaa kaa suchak he
 Many other symbols of this sacra have been said in the Brahmins, Upanishads and Puranas, but if you want to understand the Nikhil world prevailing in the expansion of the triad, then for the sake of it, this 4 brief hint is placed at the beginning of Gayatri
 
 a, u, m in teenon matraaon se kaa swaroop bana he
 a Agni, u Vayu and i symbolize Aditya
 yah vishwa prajapati kii vaak he
 There is an infinite range of speech, but if you want to take a brief sample of it and tell the form of the whole world, then saying A, U, m or 4 will give an introduction to the sacra whose trifle symbol is Tripada Gayatri

 The big one has a hard kernel like a stone, the smaller one has no kernels, the fruits that fall from the tree before they are produced or broken and dried, are called small hari
 ayurveda ke jaankaar choti harad kaa upyog adhik niraapad maanate hai kyonki aanton par unka prabhaav saumy hota he, teevr nahin

 jaisaa ki ham sab jaanate hai ki internet banking ke madhyam se aajkal dhokhadhadi ke maamle din–ba–din badhate ja rahe hai
 We can call this type of crime done through computer or internet, cybercrime
 kya aap sibar krime ke bare main jaanate hai? yah computer yaa internet ke madhyam se kii jane vaali aapraadhik gatividhiyaan hoti hai or computer krime ke naam se bhi jaani jaati hai
 Fraud can be done with credit or debit cards, but credit card fraud and cyber crime are mostly associated with theft of data
 par debit card kaa hack hone ke kai kaaran hoskate hai
 That is why we should be careful while using debit card as it is the most sensitive link in our wallet / purse
 yadi credit card se kisi prakaar kii dhokhadhadi kii jaati he to apradhi ko pakadaney kii sambhaavna hoti he lekin yadi dhokhadhadi debit card se hui ho to yah thodaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 It is directly linked to your bank account and if there is fraud, the hard earned money has gone out of your hands in one stroke and then you have to wait to see if they will get back to you
 or phir yadi aapkaa pin chori ho gaya tab to aap isse bhi bure nateezon kii ummid kar sakate hai
 Have you noticed that if the fraud is done with a credit card, all you have to do is inform your lender and you do not have to pay cash out of your pocket
 isliye aaj kal log sabhi prakaar kii gaiyr– nakadi len–dein ke liye credit card kaa istemaal karnaa pasand karne lage hai
 It is better that you keep your emergency fund in a separate or other online account of another bank, because a single fraud incident can wipe out all your savings
 ek or upaay yah bhi ho saktaa he ki aap use bank ke sidi main daal sakate hai kyonki ye adhik surakshit hai or isse phone karne yaa vyaktigat rup se jaakar hi paise nikaale ja sakate hai
 We all see our convenience and prefer close atms
 is baat par dhyaan na dete hue ham aksar mal yaa kisi dukaan par paise kaa len–dein karte hai lekin bank kii shakhaon main bane atm main bahut kam jate hai
 Do you know that atms located far from branches are also risky? saadhaaran si baat yah he ki shakha main lage atm kii tulana main bahari atm kii nigaraanee nahin hoti
 Also, it would be difficult for fraudsters to enter a bank with proper security system! Though the bank's ATM is safe but after the working hours of the bank it can prove to be risky because as soon as you open the lobby door Putting your card in a slot, fraudsters can very easily extract your information from atms through some skimming devices
 isliye, kaam ke samay ke khatm ho jane ke baad atm kaa prayog na karen
 The person who believes in cheating will get both your card number and PIN and then it will be difficult to prove him guilty
 isse use safal hone kaa avasar mil jayega
 Therefore, make a habit of changing your PIN every month
 kabhi–kabhi ham apana password yaa acount number aadi apane phone main likh kar rakh lete hai yaa onlon shopping karne ke dauraan yaa kisi anya madhyam se ise dusron se saajha karte hai
 Hacking data available online becomes easy for hackers
 yadi aapkaa phone chori ho jaae yaa jab aap apana phone bechate hai to phone main uplabdh sari jaankaree nikaali ja sakati he
 Even if you have locked your phone, it is not safe
 isliye, hamen saavdhaan rahanaa hoga
 Do you know that online use of debit card is one of the risky steps? If you do not have a credit card, put money in a pre-paid card and use the same for online shopping
 is tarah aap choron ko apane bank acount se dur rakh sakengen
 You may be taking precautions but sometimes anything can happen
 isliye, alerts set karne ke dauraan sacriye rahen taaki jaise hi dhokhadhadi ho uskaa pataa chal jaae
 If the fraudsters have reached your account, they may want to check the card with a small transaction
 yadi prayek tranjaction ke liye aapke paas uchit alert he to unhen pakadana aasaan hoga
 So, if sometimes you withdraw money and you do not get any alert message, then check it on priority basis
 saath hi hamen kabhi bhi kisi se bhi phone, email aadi ke jariye apana vivaran saajha nahin karnaa chahie
 Banks never call anyone for verification of documents and other such procedures
 isliye, doston saavdhaan rahen or kisi se bhi ise saajha na karen
 If any call comes in the name of the bank then ignore it
 ham sab yah sunate or dekhte hai ki “saavdhaanee hati or durghatana ghati” isliye is lekh ke madhyam se yah sunishchit kiya hai ki hamen debit card istemaal karte vakt kuch saavdhaaniyaan baratani chahie

 If the migration occurs after the age of 15, the migrant maintains his or her own home's vulnerability
 However, the age at risk of developing multiple sclerosis can spread over a large time-scale
 a relationship has also been found between the season of birth and MS, which supports the relationship between sunlight and vitamin D
 For example, very few people affected by MS have been born in November compared to May
