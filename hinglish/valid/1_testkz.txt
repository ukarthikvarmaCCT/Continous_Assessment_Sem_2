 saanchaa:infobox Pseudoscience Contemporary scientists such as Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawkins called astrology unscientific, and Andrew Fraknoi of the Society of Pacific Astronomy called it pseudoscience
 In 1975, the American Humanist Organization made reference to those believing in astrology that those people believe in astrology even though their belief has no proven scientific basis but there is many evidence against it

 Segan said that he would have been willing to sign a statement and would have rejected the main principles of astrological belief, which would have been more convincing and less controversial than this statement
 bhale hi ek samay main jyotish shaastra kaa bada hi simit sthaan rahaa ho, lekin 20 ve shatabdi kii shuruyaat se hi ye jyotish shastriyon ke bich anusandhan kaa vishay rahaa he
 In the historical study of nascent astrology research in the 20th century, astrological critic Jeffrey Dean and co-authors produced a rich research work, which was primarily within the community of astrology
 adhdhayan jyotish anumaan or kaaryakari tareeke se nikaale gaye parinamo ke bich sankhyikeey mahatv se sambandh sthapit karne main baar baar asafal rahe hai
 Studies of effect sizes in astrology lead to the conclusion that the average accuracy of astrological estimates is no greater than what happens by chance and that the perceived performance of astrology disappears completely during critical observation

 Another argument given by astrologers is that most studies of astrology do not reflect the nature of astrology practice and the scientific method does not apply to astrology
 Some people who consider astrology argue that due to the intentions and prevailing viewpoints of astrologers, the experiments used to find out the accuracy of astrology, consciously or unconsciously, formulate hypotheses, conduct investigations and Results are biased in full
 jyotishi jyotish ke bhautik tantra ko prastut karne main lagaataar vifal rahe hai, or kuch aadhunik jyotishi maanate hai ki swargeey nikaayon or sansaarik ghatnaon main kaaran or parinaam kaa ek sidhaa rishta hai
 In an editorial published by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, it has been written that there is no evidence that celestial bodies can contribute to affect terrestrial matters
 Some researchers believe that astrology Is precisely the causal relationship between observations and phenomena in the same way as Karism Jung's Simultaneous Theory Switch to's
 dusron bhavishyavaanee main iskaa aadhaar dekhte hai
 Yet some argue that experimentally based correlations can stand on the strength of their own epistemology and do not need any theory or mechanism to support them

 Some astrologers, on the other hand, believe that astrology is subject to scientific method if sufficient sophisticated analytical methods are used, and to support their view, they also undertake many pioneering studies in this field
 As a result, many astrologers have Advised to continue the study of astrology based on statistical verification

 The synapse is the connection of neurons or functions between neurons and other cell types

 Most synapses connect the axon to the centromere, but several other types of connections are also available, including axon-to-cellular body, axon-to-axon, and drum-to-drum

 Chemical synaptic information is the way presynaptic to pass from a cell to a cell postsynaptic and are therefore asymmetric in structure and function
 The active region of the complex called the presynaptic terminal, or synaptic pock, the neurotransmitter chamber in which the axon of the presynaptic is a small area within the S-s enclosed membrane within a special region called the synaptic synaptic vesicle is the presynaptic plasma twitch on the membrane
 Is a PSD protein called postsynaptic density and An unusually rapid process of cellular secretion occurs through, also known as exocytosis: the presynaptic nerve within the terminal, the vesicle containing the neurotransmitter "" and the saccade is prepared on the synaptic membrane

 Synaptic transmission can be modulated by desensitization, such as homo synaptic plasticity and hetero synaptic plasticity: homoanwargrawani antargrathni shakti main ek badlaav yah he ki gatividhi ke itihaas se ek vishesh antragranthan main parinaam he
 This signal can result in presynaptic calcium as well as presynaptic changes in receptors of an autocrine form, ie
 Homo may affect synaptic plasticity number and replenishment rate of vesicles, or it may affect the relationship between calcium and vesicle release

 For example, curare paralysis is a poison synaptic term which stops due to acetylcholine from depolarizing membranes
 The strychnine which causes the body to block inhibitory effects, taking glycine neurotransmitter and weakening the response to stimuli and earlier, results in uncontrollable muscle spasms
 The use of morphine neurotransmitter endorphin acts on synapses that inhibit the neurotransmitter effect of alcohol and LSD
 The use of synapses increases the GABA interference with its effects

 When action potentials in multiple neurons simultaneously fire on a single cell that weakly synapses, they may initiate an impulse in that cell although the synapses are weak
 is prakriya sankalan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 On the other hand, the ability of a presynaptic neuron firing is likely to cause an action to be released as GABA can reduce postsynaptic potential postsynaptic neuron and therefore lower its neuron excitability, in such an inhibitory neurotransmitter inhibitor
 In this way, the output of a neuron may have a different degree of effect, depending on the input of many others, each depending on the strength of its synapse with that neuron

 Evolution is the change of genetic traits of a biological population with generations
 jaivik aabaadiyon main genetic parivartan ke kaaran avlokan yogya lakshanon main parivartan hota he
 As genetic diversity varies with generations, natural selection makes those traits more common that provide greater success in survival and reproduction

 kram-vikaas jivan kii utpatti ko samajhane kii koshish nahin karata he 
 But evolution explains how today's complex life has evolved from ancient simple life
 aaj kii sabhi jatiyon ke bich samanta dekh kar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki prithvi ke sabhi jeevon kaa ek saajha purvaj he
 This is called the last public ancestor
 aaj kii sabhi jatiyaan kram-vikaas kii prakriya ke dwaara is se utpann hui hai
 All individuals have a genetic material in the form of genes
 sabhi shaks ise apane mata-pita se grahan karte hai or apni santan ko dete hai
 The genes of the offspring vary slightly
 iskaa kaaran utparivartan or langik janan ke dauraan maujuuda jeens main pherbadal he
 Due to this, children are slightly different from parents and each other
 agar wo bhinnataayen upyogi hoti hai to santan ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 Because of this, the chances of surviving and breeding different individuals of the next generation are not equal
 falswaroop jo lakshan jeevon ko apni paristhitiyon ke zyada anukulit banaate hai, agali pidiyon main wo zyada saamaanya ho jate hai
 These differences keep increasing gradually
 aaj dekhi jane vaali jeev vividhta ke liye yahi prakriya jimmedaar he
 Most genetic mutations provide no support to individuals, do not alter their appearance nor harm them
 genetic drift ke madhyam se ye nishpaksh genetic utparivartan keval sanyog se aabaadiyon main sthapit ho jate hai or bahut pidiyon tak jivit rahete hai
 In contrast, natural selection is not a random process because it protects the traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction
 prakritik varan or genetic drift jivan ke nity or gatisheel ang hai
 These processes have formed branches of the family tree of life over billions of years
 kram-vikaas kii aadhunik soch 1859 main prakashit charles darwin kii kitaab jeevajatiyon kaa udbhav se shuru hui
 In addition, studies by Gregor Mendel on plants helped to understand genetics

 Scientists now have a greater understanding of the origin of new castes and they have now observed the process of speciation in laboratory and nature
 kram-vikaas vah mul vaigyanik siddhant he jise jeevvaigyanik jivan ko samajhane ke liye prayog karte hai
 It is used in many disciplines such as medicine, psychology, bio-conservation, anthropology, forensic science, agriculture and other socio-cultural subjects
 kram-vikaas ke mukhya vichaar sankshep main nimnlikhit hai: Museums of natural history were very popular in the 19th century
 is dauraan europea khojayatraayen or nausena ke abhiyaan bade sangrahalayon ke prakritik vaigyanikon or sangrahadhyakshon ko saath le jate the
 Charles Darwin was a graduate educated and trained in the subject of natural history science
 unke jaise prakritik itihaaskaar sangrahalayon ke liye namoonon ko ikattha karte the, unki soochi banaate the, unka varnan or adhyayan karte the
 Darwin was working as a natural scientist on a ship called HMS Beagle
 unhen duniya bhar kii paanch varsh kii anusandhan yatra kaa kaam saunpa gaya tha
 During his travels he collected samples of many organisms and inspected them
 unhen dakshini america ke taton or nazadiiki gailapagos dweepasmooh ke vividh jeevon main khaas dilchaspee thi
 Darwin gained extensive experience collecting and studying specimens from far off places
 apane in adhyayanon se unhone yah vichaar pesh kiya ki har jati apane jaise lakshanon vaale purvajon se viksit hui he
 In 1938 he explained how this could be a natural process
 unhone is prakritik prakriya ko prakritik varan kaa naam diya
 The size of a population depends on the amount of resources present in its environment
 varshon tak aabaadi kaa aakaar sthir bana rahane ke liye aabaadi ke aakaar or uplabdh sansadhano main santulan bana rahanaa jaruri he
 More offspring are born than the environment the offspring can shelter
 iske kaaran kisi bhi peedi ke sabhi shaks jivit nahin rah sakate hai
 Therefore, there is always a competitive struggle for the resources necessary for survival
 is se darwin ko ehsaas hua kii uttarjivan keval sanyog par nirbhar nahin karata he
 He realized that survival depends on the individual's differences, or "traits"
 kuch lakshan shakson kii uttarjivita main sahaayta karte hai or kuch usamen baadha daalate hai
 The more customized personas of the environment give more children to the next generation than their less adapted rivals
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main baadha daalate hai wo kuch pidiyon ke baad lupt ho jate hai
 The traits that help in survival and reproduction accumulate from generation to generation
 is prakaar shakson kii uttarjivan or prajnan kii asmaan kshamta ke kaaran dhire-dhire aabaadiyon main parivartan ho jaataa he
 Observations of differences in animals and plants became the basis of the theory of natural selection
 darwin ne dekha ki orchidon or kiton main ek khaas saajhedaari hoti he jo padpon ke paragan main madad karti he
 He observed that orchids have many structures that attract insects, so that the pollen of the flowers sticks to their bodies
 is prakaar se kit ek nar orchid se ek maadaa orchid tak paraag dhote hai
 Despite the intricate appearance of the orchids, these specialized parts are made from the same basic structures that other flowers form
 apni pustak orchidon kaa nishechan main darwin prastaavit karte hai ki orchid pushp pehle se maujuud pushp bhaagon se prakritik varan kii prakriya ke dwaara parivesh ke zyada anukulit bane hai
 Darwin was still researching and experimenting with his ideas that he received a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace
 is chitthee main vailes ne darwin ke siddhant ke jaise ek siddhant kaa varnan kiya tha
 Due to this both of them jointly published these principles
 vailes or darwin donon jivan ke itihaas ko ek vansh vriksh kii tarah dekhte the, jisamen shakhaon kii nok aaj kii jatiyon ko darshaati he or shakhaon ke vibhajit hone kii jagah ek saajhe purvaj ko
 Darwin said that living things are relatives
 iskaa matlab tha ki sara jivan thode se saral purvajon se utpann hua he
 And it was also likely that all organisms had the same ancestor
 darwin ne prakritik varan dwaara kram-vikaas ke apane siddhant ko 1859 main apni pustak jeevajatiyon kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 His theory means that all organisms, including humans, are the byproduct of continuous natural processes
 iske kaaran kuch dharmik guton ne kram-vikaas ke siddhant par aapatti uthaai he
 In contrast, more than 99 percent of the people in the scientific community support this theory
 aksar prakritik varan ko swasthitam kii uttarjivita kaa paryaay samajha jaataa he, par ye abhivyakti 1864 main prakashit harbart spencer kii pustak jeevigyaan ke siddhant se janmi he, jo darwin kii kitaab ke paanch varsh baad prakashit hui thi
 Survival of the fittest misunderstands the process of natural selection because natural selection is not just about survival and not always the healthiest
 darwin ke prakritik varan ke siddhant ne kram-vikaas ke aadhunik siddhant kii neenv rakhi
 Their research and observations have shown that individuals in a population differ from each other, some of these differences are from parents, and natural selection chooses and discards these differences
 par ve in bhinnataaon kaa kaaran nahin bataa sake
 Like biologists before them they continued to understand that genetic traits were the cause of use or non-use, and that the traits that were ingested over their lifetimes could be passed on to their children
 unhone iske udhaaharan khojane kii koshish kii
 They thought that the legs of large flightless birds like the ostrich would have been overly powerful from generation to generation, and their wings would have been weakened from generation to generation due to less flying
 is galatarahami ko "adhigrahit lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta" kaha jaataa tha jo ki jin baptist lamark dwaara 1809 main prastaavit siddhant "jatiyon kaa parivartan" kaa bhaag thi
 At the end of the 19th century this theory was called Lamarckism
 darwin ne jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta samajhane ke liye pangenesis naam kaa ek asafal siddhant prastaavit kiya
 The experiments of August Weissmann in the 1880s showed that the symptoms acquired during their lifetimes could not be passed on to children
 iske kaaran kuch samay main lamarkwaad ko tyaag diya gaya
 How new traits are given to parents by offspring is answered by Gregor Mendel's pioneering work on genetics
 matar ke paudhon kii kai pidiyon par kiye gaye unke prayogon ne sabit kiya ki mata or pita main sex koshikaon ke gathan ke samay anuvaanshik jaankaree vibhajit ho jaati he or nishechan ke samay mata or pita se mili jaankaree yadrichhik dhang se jud jaati he
 This can be compared to playing cards where an organism gets half its leaves at random from the mother and the other half at random from the father
 mendal ne is jaankaree ko factors kaha, par baad main jin naam zyada prachlit ho gaya
 Genes are the basic unit of genetics
 inamen vah jaankaree hoti he jo jeev ke shaareerik vikaas or vyavhaar ko nirdeshit karti he
 Genes are made of DNA
 diene ek lanbaa anu he jo newcliotide kehalaae jane vaale chote anuon se banataa he
 Genetic information is stored in DNA as a series of nucleotides
 diene kii tulana ek lekh se kii ja sakati he jisamen newcliotide varnon kaa kaam karte hai
 Just as an article composed of a series of characters stores information, DNA composed of a series of nucleotides stores genetic information
 jin diene kii varnmaala ke varnon se bane nirdesh hote hai
 All genes come together like an "instruction manual" which contains all the information about making and functioning an organism
 diene main likhe gaye in nirdeshon kaa utparivartan ke kaaran badalanaa aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 DNA is contained in chromosomes inside the capillaries
 nishechan ke samay mata-pita se mili chromosomon ke yadrichhik mishran se santan ko jeenon kaa adwitiya sangyojan miltaa he
 This random mixing of genes during sexual reproduction also increases the genetic variation of the population
 aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata kisi duusari aabaadi ke saath prajnan karne se bhi badhati he
 For this reason, the population may have genes which were not already present in it
 kram-vikaas ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he
 Although mutations in DNA occur randomly, natural selection is not a random process, the probability of survival and reproduction depends on the environment
 kram-vikaas arabon varshon ke trutipurna pratilipikaran par prakritik varan kaa parinaam he
 The result of evolution is not a well-formed organism
 prakritik varan kaa parinaam apane maujuuda parivesh ke anukulit jeev hote hai
 Progress is not progress towards any ultimate goal
 kram-vikaas zyada viksit, zyada budhimaan yaa zyada jatil jeev banane kaa prayaas nahin karata he
 For example, the flea scorpion is a descendant of a winged creature called a fly, and pythons still have small structures that are remnants of their ancestors' hind legs
 parivesh main teevr parivartan aam taur par adhiktam jatiyon ko vilupt kar detaa he
 More than 99 percent of the castes on the earth have become extinct
 prithvi par jivan kii shruwaat ke baad se paanch pramukh samuhik viluptiyaan ho chuki hai
 Due to these there has been a big and sudden decline in the diversity of castes
 in main sabase tazaa kriteshs-peliosin vilupti ghatana he, jo 6
6 karod varsh purv hui thi
 Genetic drift refers to the change in the frequency of alleles in the populations of a caste
 elil kisi jin ke vibhinn roopantaron ko kehete hai
 They determine hair color, skin color, eye color, blood type etc
 genetic drift aabaadi main nae elil nahin laati he, par ye kisi elil ko aabaadi se hataa kar genetic vividhta ko kam kar sakati he
 Genetic drift occurs by random selection of alleles
 chayan sahi myne main yadrichhik tab hota he jab us par koi bahari bal prabhaav nahin daalata he
 For example, a random selection is to remove some marbles from an opaque bag filled with marbles of different colors at the same measurement and weight
 koi shaks apane elil apane bacchon ko de paaegaa yaa nahin, ye uske jivit rahane par nirbhar karata he jisamen sanyog bhi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 This process of changing the frequency of alleles in the population due to coincidence is called genetic drift
 genetic drift badi aabaadiyon kii tulana main choti aabaadiyon par zyada prabhaav daalati he
 The Hardy – Weinberg rule states that the frequency of alleles will not change over generations in a large population occurring in the Hardy – Weinberg society
 magar ek paryaapt aakaar kii aabaadi kaa is samyavastha main pahunchnaa asambhav he kyonki is samyavastha main pahunchane ke liye ye paanch chijen jaruri hai
 1) The population size should be infinite
 2) utparivartan kii dar shunya pratishat honi chahie, kyonki utparivartan eleelon ko badal saktaa he yaa nae elil bana saktaa he
 3) There should not be migration from or into the population, as individuals coming into or leaving the population can change the frequency of alleles
 4) aabaadi par koi chaynaatmak dabaav nahin hone chahie, arthath kisi shaks ke uttarjivan yaa prajnan kii sambhaavna dusron se zyada nahin honi chahie
 5) The intercourse should be completely random, where all males are equally attractive mates
 yah alilon kii sahi myne main yadrichhik milawat sunishchit karata he
 The population in the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium corresponds to a deck of cards; Regardless of the number of times the deck is thrown, there will be no new leaf and no leaf will come out
 yahan aabaadi main eleelon kii tulana deck ke patton se kii gai he
 Population Bottlenac refers to the rapid decline of a race's population due to environmental events
 ek sahi myne main yadrichhik aabaadi bottlenake kisi elil kaa paksh nahin letaa he; arthath yah yadrichhik hota he ki koun se shaks jivit rahenge
 a bottleneck can reduce or eliminate the genetic diversity of a population
 iske baad kii genetic drift aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko or kam kar sakati he
 Lack of genetic diversity may place populations at risk of other selective pressures
 aabaadi bottlenake kaa ek udhaaharan "uttari eliphant jalavyaghr" he
 The population of the Northern Elephant Sea was reduced by thirty persons due to the excessive hunting of the 19th
 sangrakshan ke kaaran in kii aabaadi ek lakh se zyada ho gai he or lagaataar bad rahi he
 The effects of bottleneck on the population are clearly visible
 aabaadi main genetic vividhta ke abhaav main in jalavyaghron ko rogon se kaaphi khatra he or anuvanshiki vikaar hone kii bahut sambhaavna he
 The founder's influence occurs when a small group of populations diverge from the rest of the population to form a new population
 aksar iskaa kaaran bhugolic algaav hota he
 The frequency of alleles in this new population is often different from that of the old population
 agali pidiyon kii genetic banaavat sansthaapakon kii genetic banaavat par nirbhar karegi jo puraani aabaadi se alag hogi
 An example of the founder's influence is found in the 1744 Pennsylvania transfusion of the Amish people
 amishon kii pencilvenia kii colony ke do sansthaapakon main elice–vine creveld sanglakshan ke risasive elil the
 Due to the practice of Amish people not marrying outside their community for many generations, the frequency of Ellis-van Kreveld syndrome among them is much higher than the rest of the population
 bhautikee main saral aavart gati us gati ko kehete hai jisamen vastu jis bal ke antargat gati karti he uski disha sadaa visthaapan ke vipareet evam pariman visthaapan ke samaanupati hota he
 Examples - the speed of a mass hanging from a spring, the speed of a simple pendulum, the speed of a mass tied to a spring on a frictionless horizontal plane, etc

 Simple periodic motion provides a basis on which even more complex motions can be represented with the help of furrier analysis
 ekavimiya saral aavart gati ke liye gati kaa sameekaran newton ke dwitiya niyam tathaa hook ke niyam kii sahaayta se nikaala ja saktaa he
 This equation is a second-order, fixed multiplier, simple differential equation

 Velocity and acceleration can be estimated from this equation using techniques of differential calculus: twaran kaa maan visthaapan ke falan ke rup main bhi vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: Since ω = 2πf, or t = 1 / f jahaan t aavartkaal he, It is clear from looking at these equations that frequency and periodicity are not dependent on the initial art and amplitude of the body

 Kannada speaking people call it 'sirigannad'
 kannada bhashaa kaa astitv koi 2500 varsh purv se he tathaa kannada lipi kaa prayog koi 1900 varsh se ho rahaa he
 Kannada is like other Dravidian languages and Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam are similar to this language

 The Government of India has also declared Kannada as a classical language of India
 kannada tathaa karnataka shabdon kii vyutpatti ke sambandh main bhinn-bhinn mat hai
 If a scholar is of the opinion that the word Kannada is derived from "kaniruduanadu" meaning "black clay country", then according to other scholars, "kannadu" from "kapitu Nadu" means "fragrant country" and "kannadu" from "kannadu"
 Derivation has taken place
 kannada sahitya ke itihaaskaar aar
 narsinhachaar ne is mat ko sweekaar kiya he
 Some grammars state that Kannada is a form of the Sanskrit word "karnat"
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki "karnayo atati iti karnataka" arthath jo kaanon main goonjataa he vah karnataka he
 In ancient texts, the words Kannada, Karnat, Karnataka have been used in synonyms

 In the second century Tamil poem titled "shilappadikaram", the name of the Kannada speakers is "karunadar"

 In fact, Tulu is a confirmed dialect of Kannada which is spoken in Dakshina Kannada district
 tulu ke atirikt kannada kii anya boliyaan hai–kodagu, tod, kot tathaa badug
 Kodagu is spoken in Kurg and the other three are prevalent in Nilgiri district

 Among these inscriptions, the inscription found from a place called Hulmidi is the oldest, which dates to 450 AD
 saatvin shatabdi main likhe gaye shilalekhon main badaami or shravan belgol ke shilaalekh mahatvapurn hai
 Often prose is used only in pre-eighth century inscriptions and later inscriptions have excellent specimens of poetry containing poems
 in shilalekhon kii bhashaa jahaan sugathit tathaa praudh he vahaan usapar sanskrit kaa gaharaa prabhaav dikhaai detaa he
 Thus even though there is evidence of prose-poetry in Kannada based on inscriptions dating back to the 8th century, the work of writing in Kannada progressed after the name of the first available Kannada text, "kaviraj Marg", and the language continued to develop

 Later, Napoleon Bonaparte carried this revolution to some degree by the expansion of the French Empire

 This revolution changed the direction of modern history

 In the modern era, the state revolution of France proved to be the most dramatic and complex in which the Western civilization shook Western civilization
 is kranti ne keval france ko hi nahin apitu samast europe ke jan-jivan ko ast-vyast kar diya
 The French Revolution has been called a milestone in the history of the entire world
 is kranti ne anya europea deshon main bhi swatantrata kii lalak kaayam kii or anya desh bhi rajshahi se mukti ke liye sangharsh karne lage
 This created an atmosphere against monarchy and autocracy in Asian countries, including European nations
 france main nirankush rajtantr tha jo rajtv ke daivi siddhanth par aadhaarit tha
 In this the king had unlimited rights and the king was arbitrary
 lui 14wein ke shasankaal main nirankushta apni paraakaashtha par thi
 He said- "I am the state"
 vah apni icchaanusaar kanoon banaata tha
 He made excessive centralization of power in favor of monarchy
 kootneeti or sainya kaushal se france kaa vistaar kiya
 In this way he made the monarchy a serious profession

 Louis was the 15th most luxurious, short-sighted and passive ruler

 Despite this, the Palace of Versailles remained a center of luxury
 usne kaha ki mere baad pralay hogi
 Louis was the ruler of the 16th on the eve of the revolution
 vah ek akarmanya or ayogy shaasha tha
 He too exhibited demeanor and autocracy
 usne kaha ki "yah cheez isliye kanoonee he ki yah main chahta hum
 "at the time of resignation of one of his ministers, he said - i wish i could resign

 Which was hereditary
 unki bhartee tathaa prashikshan ke koi niyam nahin the or in naukarshahon par bhi niyantran lagane vaali sanstha maujuud nahin thi
 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative
 vyaktigat kanoon or raja kii ichha kaa hi kanoon lagu hota tha
 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas
 is avyavasthit or jatil kanoon ke kaaran janata ko apane hi kanoon kaa gyaan nahin tha
 The existence of this disorganized autocratic and sensitive governance system became painful for the people
 in utpeedak raajnneetik paristhitiyon ne kranti kaa maarg prashast kiya
 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi
 The peasants had to pay many taxes to the state, the church and other zamindars and the feudal tyrants had to bear
 ek drushti se kisaanon ke asantosh kaa mukhya kaaran saamanton dwaara die ja rahe ksht evam asuvidhaayen thi or rajtantr is par chuppi saadhe hue tha
 In this way, the peasants had become so grieved that they themselves turned into a revolutionary element and they needed only a sign to make revolution
 madhyam varg main sahukaar vyapaaree, shikshak, vakil, doctor, lekhak, kalakaar, karmchaaree aadi sammilit the
 His economic condition was certainly right, yet he was angry with the political, social and economic conditions of the time
 is varg ko koi raajnneetik adhikaar praapt nahin tha or padri or kuleen varg kaa vyavhaar inke prati acha nahin tha
 For this reason the middle class hated the social superiority of the nobles and was willing to change the political system and get their rights
 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class
 purv ke vaanijya vyapaar ke kaaran is varg ne dhansampatti arjeet kar lee thi kintu ab saamanti vaataavaran main unke vyapaar par kai tarah ke pratibandh lage the jagah-jagah chungi deni padati thi
 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable
 is tarah 1789 kii francisi kranti, francisi samaaj main asamanta ke viruddh sangharsh thi
 The economic condition of France was in trouble
 rajya diwaliyapan ke kagaar par pahunch gaya tha
 In fact the royal treasury was emptied due to the extravagance of the kings of France and the frequent wars of Louis the 14th

 An excessive amount of the state was spent on the emperor, empress and his family
 varsay kaa rajmahal rajkosh ke lutpaat kaa saadhan bana tha
 On the other hand the tax system was unsatisfactory
 visheshadhikaron ke kaaran sampann varg kar se mukt tha tathaa garib kisaan jo aarthik drushti se vipann tha, ekmaatr karadaata tha
 In this way the state of the treasury had become extremely thoughtful

 The state was burdened with debt
 mul dhan kii to baat hi kya france byaaj chukaane main asamarth tha arthath rajya divaaliepan kii sthiti main pahunch gaya tha
 The country's economic malpractices could be improved by encouraging trade commerce, but the government's commercial policy was so uncontrolled and flawed that it did not make possible the development of production and trade in the state
 lui 16wein ne turgon, nekar jaise vitt salaahkaaron ke madhyam se aarthik sankat ko dur kanane kaa prayaas kiya lekin ye sudhaar prayaas lagu nahin ho sake kyonki visheshadhikaar praapt varg ne apane upar kar lagane kii baat sweekaar nahin kii
 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is
 francisi kranti main darshanikon kii bhoomika ke sandarbh main do mat saamne aate hai-ek, darshanikon ne kranti kii paristhitiyon ko janm dekar kranti ko utpann kiya or doosraa kranti kaa strot to us samay ke rashtriya jivan ke dosha main tathaa sarkaar kii bhuulon main tha or darshanikon ne kranti utpann nahin kii
 It would be desirable to understand the views of those philosophers and their relationship with the revolution before passing judgment on any opinion
 darshanikon ke vichaaron kii lokapriyata kaa nirdhaaran to us samay unke chape lekhon ke sanskarnon or prasar ke aadhaar par dekha janaa chahie
 Montescue in his book 'the Spirit of Laws' contradicted the principles of the king's divine rights and offered not only a critique of French political institutions but also an alternative
 usne likhaa ki francisi sarkaar nirkunsh sarkaar he kyonki france main karypalika, nyaaypalika or vidhayika sambandhi sabhi shaktiyaan ek hi vyakti arthath raja ke haathon main kendrit he isliye france kii janata ko swatantraaa praapt nahin he
 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii
 Voltaire illustrated the liberal politics, religion and freedom of thought of Britain through his book Letters on English and compared it to the ancient French system and noted the evils and shortcomings prevalent in France

 He wrote that crush the notorious and infamous thing
 yah spasht rup se france ke nirankush rajtantr evam carch ke atyaachaar par prahaar tha
 Waltair wanted to establish a similar rule in France, in line with the constitutional monarchy of England
 usne kaha ki main sau chuhon ke sthaan par ek singh kaa shashan pasand karata hoon
 Voltaire did not speak of revolution but laid the background for freedom of thought
 usne puraatan francisi vyavastha kii buraaiyon ko ujagar kiya
 He presented to the people the mirror of the erstwhile French society and said that the mirror is called a stain
 ruso ne apni pustak “emily”, “soshal contract”, “rusoni” ke madhyam se manushya kii swatantraaa kii baat kii
 It said that despite being born free of human beings, everyone is chained with chains
 in zanjeeron se mukti paane kaa ek hi tarika he ki ham prakritik aadim avasthaa kii ore laute
 The Russians said that it is the compulsory and universal duty of a state made by collective will to conduct the work considering the whole society as paramount
 jin logon ko karypalika shakti saupin gai he ve janata ke swami nahin uske kaaryakari he, or unka kartavya janata kii ajna kaa paalan karnaa he
 In this way he firmly believed that the paramount power should be in the hands of the public and not in the hands of any individual or institution
 saarvbhaum satta janata kii ichha main nihit he jise “saamaanya ichha” kaha gaya
 The law of the state should be an expression of this common desire, but the nature of the law is no longer such, but it is dependent on the will of the ruler
 ruson ne bhi kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin sabhi vyakti ko swatantra evam samaan mana or francisi kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav usee ke vichaaron se prabhavit the
 Napoleon acknowledged his importance and said that if there had not been the Russians, there would not have been a revolution in France

 He argued that only land is the primary source of all wealth

 By the time of the 16th, the French financial system had sunk into debt
 america swatantraaa sangram ne france ke divaaliepan par muhar laga di
 Therefore, in order to overcome the economic distress, the help of economists like Turks, Necker, Cologne took
 colon ne visheshadhikaar praapt kuleen varg par kar lagane kaa suzav diya jise kulinon ne asweekaar kar diya
 The meeting of the States General was finally called

 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy
 estats general ke adhiveshan main matadhikaar paddati ke mudde par tritiy state evam anya state ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote
 is prakaar visheshadhikaar praapt varg kaa do tathaa jansadharan kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court

 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes
 janata kii in kaarywahiyon kaa rashtriya sabha par bhi gaharaa asar padaa
 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791
 samvidhan main do baton par bal diya gaya-ek, rajya kii saarvbhaum shakti janata main nihit he or doosraa, shakti kaa pruthakkaran rajya evam janata ke hit main he
 Although the system of governance remained monarchical, the king's powers were limited

 The king did not have the right to make war or treaty with any country

 The citizens were divided into two parts, active and inactive, for the election of members of the administration and the franchise was given only to the active citizens

 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune
 prayek ikaiyon kaa shashan chalaane ke liye nirvachan parishad hoti thi jiskaa chunaav sakriy naagarik karte the
 In this way, the entire state system from the local level to the central level came to the Barja class

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge

 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi

 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
 The ability of property to be representative was also made a basis and it was only the rich who could participate in political activities and this meant that the rich people belonged to the middle class
 is tarah francisi kranti ne janm par aadhaarit bhedbhaav ko nasht kiya parantu uske jagah pracheen samantvaad ke badale dhan par aadhaarit nae samantvaad kaa prabhutv hua
 During the revolution, the revolutionaries talked about the loans taken by the autocratic government, but no one talked about forgiving those loans
 iskaa kaaran tha yah rin sarkaar ko burjua varg ne diya tha
 Similarly, the government seized the property of the church but it was not distributed to the landless
 jameenon ko sarvaadhik oonchi keemton par bechaa gaya or is jameen ko kharidne kii kshamta madhyavarg ke paas thi
 The French Revolution ignored the interests of the workers and discouraged the labor movement
 kranti ke dauraan shramik varg ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi kintu burjua netritv ko uski badhati sthiti manjuur nahin thi
 Therefore, the National Assembly re-enacted the laws made in the autocratic monarchy era
 jiske tahat sabhi shramik sangh sambandhi kaaryon par pratibandh laga diya gaye or gildon ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the National Assembly, the bourgeoisie dominated and the Jirondist and Jacobians also belonged to the bourgeoisie
 yadhyapi jacobiyan sarvhaara varg ke hit kii baat karte the parantu aatank ke rajya kii sthapana main burjua hiton ko hi upar rakhaa gaya or shramikon pratikriyaaon ko dabaane hetu sena kii sahaayta lee gai
 Middle-class interests were also given prominence in directory governance
 sanchaalak mandal ne jis dwisadani vidhayika kaa nirmaan kiya uske sabhi sadsy madhyavargeey buddhijivi the
 The bourgeoisie effect can also be seen on Napoleon's reforms
 usne burjua hiton ko sangrakshit rakhte hue apni vidhi samhita main sampatti ke adhikaar ko surakshit rakhaa, kulinon ko apekshaakrit vyapak adhikaar die tathaa uske vyapaarik or vanijyik sudhaaron kaa phayda madhyavarg ko hi mila
 In this way, middle class elements are seen in the form of revolution
 kintu puure kranti or uske prabhaav ke vishleshan se yah spasht hota he ki kranti main madhyavargeey tatwon ke saath krishak, majdoor, mahilaon kii sahamaagita thi
 In this way, it was not just a middle class revolution, but it can be seen as a popular revolution
 francisi kranti ek vishwavyaapee charitra ko liye hue thi
 The revolutionaries declared human and civil rights in 1789, under which it was said that being born equal from birth, all human beings should get equal rights and this is for all nations, for all human beings, for all time and for example
 Are for the world
 yah ghoshnaa sirp france ke liye nahin varan har jagah ke un sabhi logon kii bhalaai ke liye hai jo swatantra hona chaahate the tathaa nirankush rajtantr evam saamanti visheshadhikaron ke boj se mukti paanaa chaahate the, banaaya gaya tha
 In 1792 AD, the English hero named Kompene was awarded the title of French citizen by the National Assembly and was also elected a delegate to the National Convention
 isi prakaar kranti ke dauraan yah vichaar aayaa ki kranti ko sthaayee or sudrudh rakhane ke liye ise europe ke anya deshon main bhi vistaarit kiya jaaen
 It envisages a war in which French forces enter neighboring countries and meet local revolutionaries and overthrow the monarchy and establish republics
 france kii kranti maatr ek rashtriya ghatana nahin thi apitu siddhanton- swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav ke naaron se sampurna europe gunj uthaa
 The effects of the revolution were so far-reaching that all of Europe was covered by it
 isi sandarbh main kaha gaya “yadi france ko zukam hota he to samast europe cheenkta he
 " france kii kranti roosi kranti ke samaan suniyojit nahin thi
 In fact, the Russian Revolution was planned by the Bolsheviks and its aim was to establish the rule of the proletariat by gaining power, but the French Revolution was a victim of events and circumstances from the beginning to the end and the events did not happen in the way that the revolutionaries wished but rather the events gave the revolutionaries Forced to change his path
 stats general kii baithak main yadi tritiy state kii baat anya stats ne maan lee hoti to kranti kaa ruukh doosraa hota
 Similarly, the state of terror and the rule of the directory also did not run in a planned manner
 is drushti se yah kranti avyavasthit thi
 The degeneration of erstwhile French society was also an important factor in the origins of the French Revolution
 puraa samaaj visheshadhikaar praapt or adhikaar viheen virgon main vibhakt tha
 The condition of the peasants was bad due to the burden of taxes, on the other hand they had to suffer exploitation by the tyranny of the feudal and the intervention of the church
 in sthitiyon ne kranti ko raah dikhaai or krantikariyon ne isi asamanta ke viruddh aawaaj buland kii or swatantraaa, samanta tathaa bandhutav kaa naaraa diya
 It was only during the revolution that the end of feudalism was announced, the privileges were abolished
 francisi kranti main sarsaadhaaran kii bhaagedari raheen thi kintu unke hiton ko najrandaaj karke kranti ne adhinayakawad kaa rup dhaaran kar liya jisamen kisi ek vyakti ke siddhanton or ichchhaaon kii pradhanta thi
 In fact, during the revolution, a dictatorial government or dictatorship was established under the leadership of Robspier and later the Nepalese also established the dictatorship
 france kii kranti vahaan kii puraatan vyavastha main vyaapt tamaam vikrutiyon, visangatiyon evam buniyadi dosha ke viruddh ek shashakt pratikriya thi
 The revolution paved the way for democratic governance in France by ending French society based on autocratic monarchy inequality, luxury clergy and the crisis facing economic insolvency
 is drushti se ise drushti se ise pragatisheel kranti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he Not only this, the declaration of human rights, the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity and the ideology of nationalism made the whole world aware of the slogan of nationalism and the ideology of nationalism
 italy evam germany ke ekikaran kii bhaavana ko protsaahan mila
 The issue of segregation of religion and politics first arose during this revolution
 rajya or raajnneeti dharm se alag kiye gaye
 France's state revolution enjoys special importance in world history, it is considered an important event in human history
 isamen na keval france balki europe ke jan jivan main amulya parivartan laa diya isamen shadiyon se chali aa rahi saamanti vyavastha ko nasht kar aadhunik loktantric vyavastha kaa maarg praast kiy
 The autocracy of the monarchy came to an end and people breathed peace in the democratic atmosphere
 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries
 kuch rajyon kii sthiti to france se bhi adhik vikrut thi prasha, austria or rus aadi france se bhi adhik vikrut the
 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation
 samrudh or unnat desh main bhi kranti ho sakati he
 Provided that its residents feel that injustice is being done to them
 france kii janata is anyaay ko mahasus kar rahi thi
 Wanted to get away from it
 vahaan aise anek darshanik or lekhak paidaa hue jinhone apni lekhnee ke dwaara in kashton kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrishti karaayaa anya europee deshon kii badtar sthiti ke baavjud france main sarvapratham lui solvaan ke khilaaf kranti hui
 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom
 parantu france ke kisaan swatantra ho chuke the
 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees
 falat: kulinon kii upyogita samaapt ho gai
 Yet there was no cut in its prerogative
 isliye kisaan or madhyam varg ke log kulinvarg se ghrinaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries
 vahaan abhi bhi kulinon ki payogita bani hui thi
 The influence of philosophers 18 veen shatabdi main sampoorn europe main boudik halchal machi hui thi
 Philosophers, thinkers, scientists were present in all countries
 parantu unamem mukhya france ke vichaarak the
 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha
 Due to this, there was a revolution in France for the first time
 america swatantraaa sangram kaa prabhaav- The American War of Independence started in 1766 AD
 gimen america ke logon ne england ke khilaaf vidroh kar kar diya
 The soldiers of France also got an opportunity to participate in this freedom struggle, so they felt that freedom can be achieved through war
 unhone yah bhi anubhav kiya ki swatantraaa so hi sukh kii prapti sambhav he
 On returning to France, he saw that the freedom he fought for in America is the complete lack of freedom in France
 at: ve yahan kii kranti ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe or yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa praapt karne kii cheshtaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries of Europe
 francisi sabhyataa kii shreshthata- a specific reason for the revolution in France itself was that the civilization and culture of other Europe was more prosperous and rich than other European nations
 shashan vyavastha kii drushti se bhi france kaa shashan atyadhik suvyavasthit tha
 France is considered a symbol of civilization and culture throughout Europe
 sampoorn europe main paris sahitya or chintan kaa sabase bada kendra mana jaataa he
 The France public opinion was more aroused and critical than other European states
 in sabhi kaarnon ke falswarup 1789 i
 main anya europe rajyon main kranti na hokar sarvapratham france main hi krati hui

} seti america main sudur brahmad main jivan kii khoj karne kii samuhik kriya-kalapon ko kehete hai
 Is engaged in search is kaary ke liye seti radio sanketon kaa prayog karata he
 In addition, recommendations have also been made to use optical telescopes and other methods
 seti apane prayaason main vyast rahata he or kisi anya grah par bauddhik jivan ke bare main soochnaaon kii khoj karata rahata he
 With the help of the world's powerful observatories and telescopes, SETI collects and analyzes radio communications from every corner of the universe
 abhi tak abhi tak kii gananaa ke anusaar brahmad main ham akele hai
 Being a vacuum in space, he is not a particularly powerful radio carrier
 seti ke vaigyanikon ke anusaar yadi sudur antariksh main koi anjaan sabhyataa prithvi se bheje gaye radio sanketon ko pakadati he to use uttar main antariksh main suchanaaen chhodani chahie jaise ki ham radio or tivi steshnon ke madhyam se suchanaaen chhodte hai
 If there is a civilization in space, then it will be a very challenging task for them to capture these messages
 inkaa maananaa he ki jis tarah se hamaare paas kai lakh prakaash varsh kii duuri tak apane sandesh pahunchane kii kshamta or takanic he waisi hi takanic kisi duusare grah ke logon ke paas bhi ho sakati he
 Just as radio, TV, radar signals from Earth spread out in space, so will the radio signals of other planets
 in sanketon ko pakadakar duusari duniya ke bare main kaaphi kuch jaan sakate hai
 Initially, the US provided financial assistance to this study by SETI but later stopped it
 seti ke anek shodhakarta yah bhi maanate hai ki kisi bahari sabhyataa kii khoj ke liye hamen madhyam aavriti bheji jaani chahie or soramandal se baahar bheja jane vaala koi bhi sandesh antariksh main kisi ek sthaan par sthit hi rahanaa chahie
 For this, SETI astronomers have scanned messages by giant supercomputers, which eventually led to a decentralized computing network, SETI @ home
 vaise abhi tak kisi anya khagoleey sabhyataa ke koi lakshan saamne nahin aae hai
 According to many astronomers, no external civilization will exchange radio messages, since it is very likely that it will be far ahead of Earth's civilization
 isliye khagolvid antariksh main lager kirnon kii bhi khoj kar rahe hai
 If this attempt to send information to space ultimately fails, then SETI will have to send a vehicle, which will be a much more difficult task

 college chhodane ke baad rabbi ne kafir naamak band banaaya jise peshewar pradarshan paane ke liye kaaphi sangharsh karnaa padaa
 band ne kuch college samarohon main prastutiyaan deen lekin lekin samay ke saath band ke kai sadasyon ne korporate jagat main jane kaa nirnay kiya
 The Rabbi was committed to music and it was clear to him that he wanted to become a professional musician
 kuch dinon unhone yamaha aarex-tii motorcykilon or times epa em ke liye vigyaapan geet sangitabaddh kiye
 Rabbi released his first album after struggling for many years
 shuru main unhone soni music ke saath kaam kiya, lekin phir soni peeche hat gaya
 He then approached Minty Tejpal, brother of Tarun Tejpal, the former editor-in-chief of Tehelka, liked Rabbi's music and proposed a contract to the rabbi
 iske turant baad tahalaka vittiya samasyaon se ghir gaya or antat anubandh radd kar diya gaya
 Magnasound also offered him a contract, but the company went bankrupt before the album arrived
 unhen antat fat fish records dwaara sin kiya gaya, jo unki pratham album laayaa
 Her debut album Rabbi was released in 2004
 ek music video or maukhik prachaar par bharosa karte hue, rabbi shergill ko turant safalataa praapt hui
 "bulla ki jana" became the most played song of the 2005 non-film songs
 paap or vaisaa bhi hota he bhaag II jaisi filmon main geet "bulla ki janaa" ko shaamil karne ke anurodh aaye, lekin lekin rabbi ne sweekaar nahin kiye
 Other songs on the album include Khushi's song "ajj Nachna", Pyaar's song "tere Bin" based on contemporary issues "jugni"
 album ke adhikansh geet rabbi dwaara swayan hi rachit or sangitabaddh kiye gaye hai, haalanki "bulla ki janaa" geet 18veen shatabdi ke muslim sufi rahasywaadee baba bulle shah dwaara rachit he, "hir" vaaris shah kii hir raanjha par aadhaarit he tathaa "ishtihaar" shiv kumaar bataalavi dwaara likhaa gaya he

 On 9 April 2008, Nokia India announced that Shergill's album, Avengi Jaa Nahi would be available on its n series of multimedia phones just a month before the audio CD was released
 is album main 9 geet hai jo sampradayik hinsa, saamaajik uttardaayitv or "samuhik naitikta" kii aavashyaktaa jaise muddon se sambandhit he
 Shergill's major contribution to music lies in the use of the Punjabi language - which was earlier akin to either Bhangra or traditional folk music - and using Punjabi, he composed rock-based ballads and gave the language new music
 Given the related dimension
 apane kavy sangat, saamaajik rup se praasangik geeton ke bol or ek vayask vaikalpik aawaaj ke kaaran, shergill turant hi shahari logon se jud gaye, jo unhen apane vaastavik or mul geeton ke liye pyaar karne lage

 Nirvana literally means 'extinguished'
 kintu buddha, jain dharm or vaidic dharm main iske vishesh arth hai
 The Shramana ideology has a state of freedom from suffering or grief
 paali main "nibbaan" kaa arth he "mukti paanaa"- yani, laalach, ghrinaa or bhram kii agni se mukti
 This is the ultimate truth of Buddhism and the main principle of Jainism
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa Although the use of the word nirvana in the sense of 'liberation' is found in the new and old texts of the Gita, Bhagavata, Raghuvansh, Shariak Bhashya, etc
, the term is the definition of Buddhists
 sankhya, nyaay, vaisheshik, yoga, mimasaa or vedant main kramshah moksh, apvarg, nickshreyas, mukti yaa swargaprapti tathaa kaivalya shabdon kaa vyavhaar hua he par buddha darshan main baraabar nirvana shabd hi aayaa he or uski vishesh rup se vyakhya kii gai he
 There are two main branches of Buddhism - Hinayana and Mahayana
 inamen se hinayan shakha ke sab granth paali bhashaa main hai or buddha dharm ke mul rup kaa pratipaadan karte hai
 The Mahayana branch is somewhat behind and all its texts are written in Sanskrit
 mahayan shakha main hi anek aacharyon dwaara buddha siddhanton kaa nirupan gudh tarkpranali dwaara darshanik drushti se hua he
 In ancient times, the Buddhist masters of Vedic Acharyas with whom they spoke were often from the Mahayana branch
 atah nirvana shabd se kya abhipraay he iskaa nirnay unheen ke vachanon dwaara ho saktaa he
 The Bodhisattva Nagarjuna has written in the Madhyamika Sutra that 'the eradication of bhavasantati is nirvana', that is, by our rites, we fall into the bondage of birth again and again, this eradication can destroy destruction
 ratnakutasutra main buddha kaa yah vachan haih raag, dwesh or moh ke kshay se nirvana hota he
 In the Bajrakshaika, the Buddha has said that nirvana is imperishable, there is no sacrament in it
 madhyamik sutarakaar chandrakirti ne nirvana ke sambandh main kaha he ki sarvaprapanchanivartak shoonyata ko hi nirvana kehete hai
 What is this emptiness or nirvana! Neither can it be called emotion, nor lack
 kyonki bhav or abhaav donon ke gyaan ke kshap kaa hi naam to nirvana he, jo asti or naasti donon bhaavon ke pare or anirvachaneey he
 Madhvacharya has also stated the same meaning of emptiness in his Sarvadarshanasangraha - 'asti, Nasti, Umbhaya and Anubhimaya are nothingness from this quadrant
 madhyamik sutara main nagarjun ne kaha he ki astitv or naastitiv kaa anubhav alpbuddhi hi karte hai
 Wise people get the welfare of both of them
 upyukt vaakyon se spasht he ki nirvana shabd jis shoonyata kaa bodhak he usase chitt kaa grahyagraahakasambandh hi nahin he
 i am false, the world is also false
 ek baat dhyaan dene kii he ki buddha darshanik jeev yaa aatma kii bhi prakrut satta nahin maanate
 They consider nothing more than a non-zero
 kii shrenee kaa hissaa The Buddha described nirvana as that ultimate peace of mind that goes beyond craving, anger and other agonizing states of mind
 aisa praani jisane jivan main shanti ko paa liya he, jiske man main sabhi ke liye dayaa ho or jisane sabhi ichchhaaon or bandhanon kaa tyaag kar diya ho
 yah shanti tabhi praapt hoti he jab sabhi vartmaan ichchhaaon ke kaaran samaapt ho jaaen or bhavishya main paidaa ho sakane vaali ichchhaaon kaa jad se naash ho jaae
 nirvana main trishna or dwesh ke kaaran jad se samaapt ho jate hai, jisase manushya sabhi prakaar ke kashton yaa sansar main punarjanm ke chakra se chhot jaataa he
 There are also other approaches to nirvana in Pali principles; According to one, it is the same as finding vacancies in any fact
 At the same time it is also shown as a whole rearrangement of consciousness and opening of layers of conscious
 vidwaan harbart gintar kaa kahana he ki nirvana se "adarsh vyaktitv, sachcha insaan" vaastaviktaa ban jaataa he
 In the Dhammapada, the Buddha says that nirvana is the "ultimate bliss"
 yah anand chirsthai or sarvopari hoti he jo gyanoday yaa bodhi se praapt hone vaali shanti kaa ek abhinn ang he
 This pleasure is completely different from the happiness of mortal things
 nirvana se judaa hua gyaan bodhi shabd ke madhyam se vyakt hota he
 The Buddha interpreted Nirvana as a "spontaneous" mind
 aisa man jo ichchhaaon ke ant ke kaaran purna spashtataa or subodhgamyata kii sthiti main pahunch gaya he
 Buddha described it as "deathlessness") and ultimate spiritual enlightenment, which is the natural result that one gets when leading a virtuous life and walking on the perfect eight-point ideal path
 aise jivan se karm or wan kii sandhi se bana he
 Nir means "separation, away or without" and Vana means "liberation" such as "flowing air" and "sniffing, etc
"
 abhidharm-mahavibhasha-shaastra, jo ek sarvastvaadi vichaar he, main is shabd ke sanskrit se utpann sabhi sambhavit arthon kaa varnan he: Nirvana has never been considered as a place in the sutras, rather it is considered a paradox of the world, which is actually synonymous with ignorance
 
 kaha gaya he: The exact meaning of nirvana is the attainment of knowledge - which eliminates the identity of the mind and creates an attachment to the basic fact
 saidhantik taur par nibbaan ek aise man ko kaha jaataa he jo "na aa rahaa he or na ja rahaa he " or usne shashvatata kii sthiti ko praapt kar liya he, jisase "mukti" milti he
 Stability, coolness and peace also have its meanings
 nirvana kii prapti kii tulana avidya ke ant se kii jaati he
 Which awakens the desire for that state of mind which frees the life cycle
 sansar mulat: trishna or agyanta kii upaj he 
 vyakti bina mrityu ke bhi nirvana kii prapti kar saktaa he
 When a person who has attained nirvana dies, that death is called moksha], because he is completely missed by the last connection of life and death and rebirth and is not born again
 Buddhism considers the end of worldly existence the ultimate goal and this is the attainment of nirvana; What happens after the death of such a person cannot be explained by parinirvāṇa, because this experience is beyond the limits of human understanding
 kai prashnon kii ek shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se shariputt ne ek bhikshu se manvaaya ki tathagat ko apane vartmaan jivan main bhi satya yaa vaastaviktaa nahin mana ja saktaa, aise main arhant kii mrityu ke pashchaat kii sthiti par atakalein lagaana sahi nahin hoga
 dekhen tathagat # inascrooteble After attaining a level of knowledge, one experiences nirvana like mental consciousness
 kuch dharanaon ke anusaar agar nibbaan ke raste par chalaa jaae to ye arhant ko gyaan prapti or samadhi kii ore le jaataa he
 If the yogi realizes that this situation is artificial and therefore mortal, when reaching this state by the development of the inner being, then all the bonds end, the person becomes arahant and attainment of Nibbana
 man jaagruk he; yah chetan he
 Nirvana opens consciousness and the mind becomes free from all the shackles of this uneasy world and becomes aware
 buddha ne is baat kaa kai tarah se varnan kiya he
 One of these is as follows: chetana niraakaar he, iskaa koi ant nahin he or ye sabhi taraf se tejasvi he
 Ajan Pasanno and Ajan Amaro write that the term science is seen in terms of the quality of Chetan
 unke mutabik "vinyaan" ko uske shabdic arth se kahin adhik samajha janaa chahie: "buddha ne apane samakaksh kai darshanikon kii tarah vidya ke aadambar or paakhand ke bajaay ek bade daayre main aam logon kii samaj main aane vaali bhashaa kaa prayog kiya, jisase unka sandesh adhik se adhik samajha ja sake
 isliye 'vinyaan' ko yahaan par 'jaanane' ke arth main liya ja saktaa he, lekin aanshik tutaa-phuta, bhedbhaavparak jaananaa nahin, jo aamtaur par iskaa arth lagaaya jaataa he
 Rather it should mean preliminary and excellent knowledge, otherwise the contradiction will appear in the context in which it is being spoken
 "he then explained what could have been the reason behind the selection of these words
 This" latent consciousness "six senses Is different from the consciousness of others, the rest of the consciousnesses have a "surface", which causes a reaction
 peter harvey ke anusaar pracheen granthon main is mudde par do raay he ki "chetan" shabd sateek he yaa nahin
 ek mukt vyakti iskaa sahaj rup se anubhav karata he
 According to one interpretation, "prakaswan Chetan" is similar to Nirvana
 duusare isse sahamat nahin he, unke anusaar ye nirvana nahin he, balki ye ek prakaar kii chetana he jo keval arhantko hi praapt hoti he
 In the Majjhima Nikaya it is described as a blank space
 mukt vyaktiyon ke liye nibbaan se judi hui prakashwan sahaj chetana, maansik chetana ke dhyaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or ye maansik chetana ke sabhi bhaagon se utkrisht hoti he
 This is completely different from the concept of enlightenment of the former Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, which speak of awakening the inner consciousness of a person, while it does not emphasize this aspect and is not confused with "self" in any way
 needed
 Furthermore, according to the sixth meditation of the Buddha, it excels in the field of unlimited consciousness, which itself does not end on the pretense of "I"
 nagarjun ne bhi dignikaay main chetana ke str par do sthanon par sanket die hai
 He wrote: sadhu ne ghoshnaa kii ki prithvi, jal, agni or vaayu, lanbaa, chota, maheen or kadaa, acha ityadi sabhi chetana main bujh jate hai
 

 Here long and short, fine and hard, good and bad, all these names and forms cease
 isi se judaa vichaar, jise paali siddhant or samakaleen therwaad main samarthan mila he, jabaki therwaad bhashya or abhidhamm main iskaa ullekh nahin dikhataa, ye kahata he ki arhant kaa man hi nibbaan he
 In Mahayana Buddhism, both nirvana and samsara are seen as the ultimate nature of dharmakayi, both of them are not separate
 ek vyakti buddha path se nirvana kii prapti kar saktaa he
 It would not have been possible if these two were completely different
 That is, the dualism of nirvana and samsara is traditionally accurate
 is nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa ek or rasta yah vishleshan he ki sabhi tathy ek aavashyak pahchaan se rikt hote hai, isliye pidaa kisi bhi paristhiti main janmajaat nahin hoti
 isliye du:kha or uske kaarnon se mukti koi abhautik prakriya nahin he
 For further explanation of this idea, see Dualism
 theravadamat sansar or nibbaan ke bich paraspar virodhabhas ko darshata he, jahaan se mukti kii khoj shuru hoti he
 At the same time, this contradiction also leads to the ultimate goal, which is to truly excel in the world and attain salvation through Nibbana
