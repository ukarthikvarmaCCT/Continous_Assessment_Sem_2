 Others' comment is that Soldier is more likely to have originated from Gold Solidus, through which soldiers are aware of the payment and in turn they say that salarium is either salt There was an allowance for the purchase of or the cost of keeping troops to cope with the salt supplies and the protection of the salt routes leading to Rome

 After this, he created eighteen Puranas for the welfare of the male and female retarded women, who were deprived of the right to study, so that they too would be able to practice religion

 aap jaanate hai-janmejay ke pita raja parakshit ko takshak sarp ne das liya tha or raja ne apni hatya ke kalyaan ke liye shrimad bhagwat puraana kaa shravan kiya tha

 At the same time Maharishi Narada came
 samachar jaanakar naradji ne vasudev se shrimad devi bhagwat puraana ke shravan kaa upadesh diya
 Vasudev was previously familiar with the grace of Mother Bhagwati
 unhone naradji se kaha-devarshi, devaki ke saath karagaravaas karte hue jab chha: putr kansa ke haathon maare ja chuke the to ham donon pati-patni kaaphi vyathit or ansatulit ho gaye the
 Then he consulted his clan priest Maharishi Garg and asked for a solution to get rid of trouble
 gurudev ne jagadamba maa kii gaatha kaa parayan karne ko kaha
 Being in prison was not possible for me
 at: gurudev se hi yah kaary sampann karaane kii prarthana kii
 Vasudev said - By accepting my prayer, Gurudev went to Vindhyachal mountain and worshiped the goddess with the Brahmins
 vidhi-vidhanpurvak devi bhagwat kaa nawahr yajna kiya
 On completion of the ritual, Gurudev informing me of this, said - Goddess has pleased this Akashvani - With my inspiration, Vishnu himself will incarnate the house of Vasudev Devaki to alleviate the suffering of the earth
 vasudev ko chahie ki us balak ko gokul gram ke nand-yashoda ke ghar pahunchaa den or usee samay utpann yashoda kii balika ko laakar aathvin santan ke rup main kansa ko saunp den
 Kans, as always, would throw the baby girl to the ground
 vah balika kansa ke haath se tatkaal chhootakar divya sharir dhaaran kar, mere hi ansh rup se lok kalyaan ke liye vidhyanchal parvat par vaas karegi
 On hearing this ritual fruit by Garga Muni, i expressed happiness and completed the following events according to Muni's statement and protected Krishna
 yah vivaran sunaakar vasudev naradji se kehane lage-muniver ! saubhaahgya se aapkaa aagaman mere liye shubh he
 Therefore, please oblige me by narrating the story of Goddess Bhagwat Purana
 vasudev ke kehane par naarad ne anugrah karte hue nawahr parayan kiya
 At the end of the ninth day, Vasudeva worshiped Naradji and when Krishna entered the cave from the Maya of Bhagwati's mother, he saw a girl playing with a gem
 jaise hi krishna ne balika se mani lee, to balika ro uthi
 Hearing the crying of the girl, Jamwant arrived there and started fighting with Krishna
 donon main sattaees din tak yuddh chalata rahaa
 By the grace of Goddess, Jamwant continued to suffer and Shri Krishna became powerful
 ant main unhone jamavant ko parajeet kar diya
 By the grace of Bhagwati, Jamwant had a prior memory
 treta main ravan kaa vadh karne vaale ram ko hi dwapar main krishna ke rup main avatarit jaanakar unki vandana kii
 Apologized for the crime committed in ignorance
 mani ke saath apni putree jambavati ko bhi prasantaapurvak krishna ko samarpit kar diya
 After the narrative ended in Mathura, Vasudev was taking blessings after the Brahmin banquet, at the same time Krishna reached there with Mani and Jambavati
 krishna ko vahaan dekhakar sabhi kii prasannataa kii koi seemaa na rahi
 In gratitude to Bhagwati, vasudev-devaki welcomed Shri Krishna with tearful eyes
 vasudev kaa safal kaam banaakar naarad devloak waapas laut gaye
 According to the Goddess Bhagwat Purana, Sutji while narrating this story to the incoming monks said, Sridvalu sages! The devotees should take advice from any astrologer to get the auspicious time for Katha Shravan or it is suitable for Navratras

 Whoever can give more time in listening, definitely give it
 sabhi aagantukon kaa swaagat satkar aayojan kaa dharm he
 The place of legend should be dipped with cow dung and hang a dome shaped canopy over it and hoist a flag containing goddess image over it

 Retire from morning bath, etc

 Goddess Bhagwat Granth should be worshiped by worshiping Goddess Shodashopachara and pray for the Goddess Yagya to end uninterrupted
 pradakshina or namaskara karte hue devi kii stuti prarambh kerani chahie
 After that, one should listen to the Devi Katha while meditating
 katha ke shravankaal main shrota athwa vaktaa ko kshor karm nahin karwaanaa chahie
 Sleeping celibacy on the ground, simple food restraint, pure conduct, true speech, and fasting for non-violence should be taken
 taamas padaarth yatha-pyaaj, lahasun, maance, madiraa aadi kaa bhakshan bhi varjit he
 The female affair should be forcibly abandoned
 navahn yajna kii samaapti par nawein din anushthan kaa udhyapan karnaa chahie
 On that day both the speaker and the Bhagavata Purana should be worshiped
 brahman tathaa kumarikaon ko bhojan evam dakshina dekar trupt karnaa chahie
 Home to the Gayatri Mantra, donating it to the Bhagavata Purana speaker Brahmin installed on the Golden Manjusha, should leave him satisfied with Dakshinadi

 ve ek prakaar se sankhya ke antim acharya hai
 It was he who included theism in the Samkhyaat
 inhone teen darshanon par bhashya-granth likhe hai- sankhyapravachanbhashya ; yogavarthik, vignanamritabhashya 
 The Vigyanabhukta, while presenting his commentary on the Sankhyasutra with full justification, says that Sankhya had become 'time-bound'
 is tantrapranali ko pun: punerjeevit karne ke liye hi ve prayatnsheel rahe hai
 Moving towards the form of the lost Samkhya, he was always trying to reconcile the Samkhya and Vedanta, which were separated from the era of the Upanishads and Puranas
 vigyanbhikshu veydant ke prati bhi aasthashil the
 His commentary on the Brahmasutra by the name 'vigyanamrit' attests to this fact
 is baat ko sweekaar karne ke anek kaaran vidyaman hai jinke aadhaar par bataaya ja saktaa he ki sankhya darshan dhire-dhire vedant darshan main vilupt hota prathit hota he
 Even the science scholar had tried to give the Vedantic false belief indicator Maya a uniform representation of the true symbolic nature of Sankhya
 yahi kaaran he ki parvarti buddha tarkikon ke aavirbhaav ke falswarup mimasaa karne ke prayaas main bhale hi anek tatvamanishi avibhoot hue par sankhyamatwaad kaa kisi bhi drushtikon se gambhir adhyayan prastut nahin kiya gaya
 In fact, after an amendment that brought Sankhyadarshan to the realm of Vedanta, Sankhya ceased to exist as an independent sect
 sankhya darshan ke sambandh main mulat: in do paraspar virdohi matagrahon ke niraakaran ke liye shankaracharya kaa brahmasutra hamaari paryaapt sahaayta kar saktaa he
 It is intended to point out that the Brahmasutra overemphasized the refutation of Sankhyadarshana as the Brahmasutraka accepted Sankhya as his staunch rival, as it was, in Sankhya's pradhanism or causalism where a fundamental-physical element was said to be the beginning of the world
 , Stood in stark contrast to the original conscious consciousness of Advaita Vedanta
 yahi kaaran tha ki brahmasutra ke pratham chaar sutron main brahm tathaa vedant grantho ke swarup ke sambandh main kuch moulik mahatv kii baton kaa spashtikaran karte hi brahm sutarakaar tatkaal agle saat sutron main yah spasht karne ke liye vyagr ho uthte hai ki brahm ek chetan tatv he, jiskaa pruthakkaran sankhya darshan ke 'pradhan'se kiya janaa chahie jo achetan athwa bhautik hone ke kaaran vishwa kaa mul nahin ho saktaa
 834 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 834 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he

 The Vat Savitri fast is considered to be a fast that gives good fortune and helps in the attainment of children
 bhartiya samskruti main yah vrath adarsh naritv kaa pratik ban chukaa he
 There are different opinions about the date of this fast
 skanda puraana tathaa bhavishyottar puraana ke anusaar jyeshtha maas ke shukla paksh kii poornima ko yah vrath karne kaa vidhaan he, vahiin nirnyamrita aadi ke anusaar jyeshtha maas kii amavasya ko vrath karne kii baat kahi gai he
 Despite the difference in dates, the aim of the fast is the same: the growth of good luck and the assimilation of the rituals of husbandry
 kai vrath visheshgy yah vrath jyeshtha maas kii trayodashi se amavasya tak teen dinon tak karne main bharosa rakhte hai
 Similarly, this fast is also observed from Trayodashi of Shukla Paksha to Poornima
 vishnu upaask is vrath ko poornima ko karnaa zyada hitkar maanate hai
 In Vat Savitri fast, both 'vat' and 'savitri' have been considered to be of specific importance
 pipal kii tarah vat yaa bargad ke ped kaa bhi vishesh mahatv he

 puraanon main yah spasht kiya gaya he ki vat main brahma, vishnu va mahesh teenon kaa vaas he
 Sitting under it, listening to worship, fasting etc
, fulfills the desire
 vat vriksh apni vishalata ke liye bhi prasiddh he
 It is possible that the worship of Jyeshtha month in Vanagman was also done under the vat to protect from the scorching heat and later it has developed into a religious tradition
 darshanik drushti se dekhen to vat vriksh dderghaayu va amartv-bodh ke pratik ke naate bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 Vat tree is also a symbol of knowledge and nirvana
 bhagwaan buddha ko isi vriksh ke neeche gyaan praapt hua tha

 It was the capital around present-day Lahore
 raja poras porawa rajvansh ke vashanj the, jinka samrajya punjab main jhelum or chenab nadiyon tak or upnivesh hipsis tak failaa hua tha
 Porus or Poros was the king of the Powers
 inkaa kshetra hidespesh or asicense ke bich tha jo ki ab punjab kaa kshetra he
 Porus fought with Alexander the Great at the Battle of Hydaspes
 poras kaa samrajya : puruvanshi mahaan samraat poras kaa samrajya vishalkay tha
 Maharaja Porus was the owner of a very large area including sindh-punjab

 It is noteworthy that the Khokhars living in this area had killed Mohammad Ghori to avenge the murder of Rajput Emperor Prithviraj Chauhan
 ‘poras apni bahaduree ke liye vikhyath tha
 He built his empire with the support of all those who accepted his leadership over the Khukrayans
 jab sikandar hindustan aayaa or jehalam ke sameep poras ke saath uskaa sangharsh hua, tab poras ko khukhrayanon kaa bharpoor samarthan mila tha
 Thus Porus, who was himself a subharwal sub-caste and a part of the Khukrayan caste group, became their powerful leader

 Historians believe that Puru had faith in his valor and Hastisena but that did not stop Alexander from crossing the Jhelum River and that was his mistake
 lekin itihaaskaar yah nahin jaanate ki jhelum nadi ke is paar aane ke baad sikandar buree tarah funs gaya tha, kyonki nadi paar karne ke baad nadi main baadh aa gai thi
 When Alexander attacked, he was welcomed by Ambhi, the king of gandhara-taxila and Ambi secretly assisted Alexander
 aambhi raja poras ko apana dushman samajhataa tha
 Alexander sent a message to Porus, in which he wrote to Porus surrendering to Alexander, but Porus then did not accept Alexander's subjection
 agle panne par yuddh kaa varnan


 Alexander's nobles were fully confident of winning the war on the strength of spies and deceit
 raja puru ke shatru laalchee aambhi kii sena lekar sikandar ne jhelum paar kii
 Raja Puru whom the Yavni himself describes as above 7 feet, with his powerful Gajsena, broke on the Yavani army

 The Greek army had never seen this happen in all its wars
 sikandar jameen pargira to saamne raja puru talwaar liye saamne khadaa tha
 Sikandar was just a moment's guest when Raja Puru shouted
 yah dar nahin tha, shaayad yah arya raja kaa kshaatr dharm tha, baharhaal tabhi sikandar ke angrakshak use teji se vahaan se bhaga le gaye
 The only information available on Porus is from Greek sources, though historians have argued that Porus was likely to be a descendant of the Puru tribe mentioned in the Rigveda, based on his name and location of his domain
 itihaaskaar ishwari prasad ne kaha ki poras yaduwanshi shorseni ho saktaa tha
 He argued that Porus' troops from Porus saw a banner of Herakles by Megasthanis, who was clearly identified with the Shorasanis of Mathura by Chandragupta on his visit to India after Porus
 megastenis or arian ke heracals kuch vidwaanon dwaara krishna ke rup main or anya logon dwaara unke bade bhai baldev ke rup main pahachaane gaye hai, jo shorsenis ke purvajon or sangrakshak devataaon donon the

 maharaja poras sindh-punjab sahit ek bahut bade bhu-bhaag ke swami the
 Puru did not try to find out what is the secret of the power of the Yavana army? The main force of the Yavana army was its fast cavalry and agile archers riding horses
 itihaaskaar maanate hai ki puru ko apni veerta or hastisena par vishwaas tha lekin usne sikandar ko jhelum nadi paar karne se nahin roka or yahi uski bhul thi
 But historians do not know that Alexander was badly trapped after this crossing of the river Jhelum, because the river was flooded after crossing the river
 jab sikandar ne akraman kiya to uskaa gandhar-takshashila ke raja aambhi ne swaagat kiya or aambhi ne sikandar kii gupt rup se sahaayta kii
 Ambi King considered Porus his enemy

 raja puru jisko swayan yavani 7 foot se upar kaa bataate hai, apni shaktishaalee gajasena ke saath yavani sena par tut pade
 Alexander and his soldiers were horrified by the terrible destruction of the Greeks by the army of Porus
 bharatiyon ke paas videshi ko maar bhagane kii har naagarik ke hath, shaktishaalee gajasena ke alaava kuch andekhee hathiyaar bhi the jaise saatphuta bhaalaa jisase ek hi sainik kai-kai shatru sainikon or ghode sahit ghudsavaar sainikon bhi maar gira saktaa tha
 In this war, Alexander's army got a fierce competition on the very first day
 sikandar kii sena ke kai vir sainik hataahat hue
 Despite being horrified by the Yandi chieftains, Alexander stood firm on his stubbornness and entered the battlefield between his special bodyguard and his internal defense
 koi bhi bhartiya senapati haathiyon par hone ke kaaran un tak koi khatra nahin ho saktaa tha, raja kii to baat bahut dur he
 King Puru's brother Amar killed Alexander's horse Bukiphilas with his spear and dropped Alexander to the ground
 aisa unani sena ne apane saare yudhkaal main kabhi hote hue nahin dekha tha
 Sikandar stood in front of the ground with Raja Puru sword
 sikandar bas palabar kaa mehmaan tha ki tabhi raja puru thithak gaya
 It was not feared, perhaps it was the Kshatra Dharma of the Arya King, however, then Alexander's bodyguards drove him away from there rapidly

 ek baar satrajit ne bhagwaan surya kii upasna karke unase syamantak naam kii mani praapt kii
 The light of that gem was the same as that of Lord Surya
 ek din bhagwaan krishna jab chausar khel rahe the tabhi satrajit us mani ko pahan kar unke paas aayaa
 Seeing him coming from far away, the Yadavas said, "O Krishna! The sun god or Agnidev is coming for your visions
 " is par shri krishna hans kar bole, "he yadavon! yah satrajit he, usne surya bhagwaan se praapt syamantak mani ko pahan rakhaa he isi liye vah tejomay ho rahaa he
 "at the same time Satrajit arrived there
 satrajit ko dekhakar un yadavon ne kaha, "are satrajit! tere paas yah alokik divya mani he
 The king possesses a supernatural beautiful object
 isaliye tu is mani ko hamaare raja ugrasen ko de de
 "but upon hearing this, Satrajit went away from there without giving any answer
 satrajit ne syamantak mani ko apane ghar ke ek dev mandir main sthapit kar diya
 That gem used to give him eight loads of gold every day
 jis sthaan main vah mani hoti thi vahaan ke saare ksht swayan hi dur ho jate the
 One day Satrajit's brother Prasenjit went on a horse riding the horse wearing that gem
 van main prasenjit tathaa uske ghode ko ek singh ne maar daalaa or vah mani chin lee
 Raksharaj Jambavant killed that lion and got the gem and went to his cave
 jambavant ne us mani ko apane balak kaa khilonaa bana diya
 When Prasenjit did not return, Satrajit understood that Shri Krishna had snatched the gem by killing my brother
 shri krishna ji par chori ke sandeh kii baat puure dwarikapuri main fail gai
 When Shri Krishnachandra heard that i was accused of theft in vain, he went on a chariot with the leading Yadavas of the city to wash this stigma and went in search of Syamantaka Mani
 van main unhone ghoda sahit prasenjit ko mara hua dekha par mani kaa kahin ata-pataa nahin tha
 There were signs of lion's claws near there
 ve singh ke padchinhon ke sahare aage bade to unhen singh bhi mara hua mila or vahaan par rich ke pairon ke chinh mili jo ki ek gupha tak gayi the
 When he reached near that fierce cave, Shri Krishna told the Yadavs that you people stop here
 main is gupha main pravesh kar mani le jane vaale kaa pataa lagaataa hoon
 Having said this, they left all the Yadavas at the mouth of the cave and went inside the cave
 vahaan jaakar unhone dekha ki us prakashwan mani ko rich kaa ek balak liye huye khel rahaa he
 Shri Krishna lifted the gem from there
 yah dekh kar jambavant atyant krodhit hokar shri krishna ko maarane ke liye jhapata
 There was a fierce war between Jambavant and Shri Krishna
 jab shri krishna ji gupha se waapas nahin laute to saare yadav unhen mara hua samaj kar baarah din ke uparant vahaan se dwarika puri waapas aa gayi tathaa samast vattant vasudev or devaki se kaha
 Vasudev and Devaki became distraught and started worshiping Mahamaya Durga
 unki upasna se prasann hokar durga devi ne prakat hokar unhen aashirwad diya ki tumhaara putr tumhen avashya milegaa
 Both Shri Krishna and Jambavant were mighty
 yuddh karte huye gupha main atthis din vyateet ho gayi
 Mahabali Jambavant's nerve broke due to the beating of Lord Shri Krishna
 vah ati vyakul ho uthaa or apane swami shri ramachandra ji kaa samaran karne laga
 Lord Sri Krishna appeared to him as Shri Ramchandra as soon as he remembered Shri Rama through Jambavant
 jambavant unke charnon main gir gaya or bolaa, "he bhagwaan! ab maine janaa ki aapane yaduvansh main avatar liya he
 "shri Krishna said," o Jambavant! You expressed my desire to fight with me after Ravana was killed at the time of my Rama avatar and i told you that i will definitely fulfill your wish in my next incarnation
 apana vachan satya siddh karne ke liye hi maine tumse yah yuddh kiya he
 "jambavant praised Lord Krishna in many ways and married his daughter Jambavanti to him
 shri krishna jambavant ko saath lekar dwarika puri pahunche
 On his return, happiness spread all over Dwarka Puri
 shri krishna ne satrajit ko bulawaakar uski mani use waapas kar di
 Satrajit became extremely ashamed and repented due to the false stigma he imposed on Shri Krishna
 praayshchit ke rup main usne apni kanya satyabhama kaa vivaah shri krishna ke saath kar diya or vah mani bhi unhen dahej main de di
 But Sherna Vatsal Shri Krishna did not accept that gem and returned it to Satrajit
